<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>NEVER tell me!&mdash;I repeat it, you are a fel|low of a very &s;candalous cour&s;e of life!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I repeat it, I'm a perfect image of the pure&s;t virtue, compared to whom, for &s;obriety and continence, Ca|to was a drunkard, and Lucretia little better than &s;he &s;hould be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! hardened in impudence!&mdash;Can you deny being a pilferer, a liar, a glutton&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can I?&mdash;Heaven be thanked, I've courage enough to deny any thing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doesn't all the world cry out upon you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly my tran&s;cendant merit has procured me &s;ome enemies; and, in common with many other great men, my virtue at pre&s;ent labours under &s;omething of a cloud. But under&s;tand me right, Father: Though I don't a&s;&s;ent to the &s;um-total of your accu&s;ations, po&s;&s;ibly I may acknowledge &s;ome of the items; the be&s;t actions frequently appear culpa|ble, merely becau&s;e their motives are unexplained. There|fore produce your charges, let me ju&s;tify my conduct, and I doubt not I &s;hall retrieve my reputation from your hands as immaculate and pure as a new &s;heet of fool&s;cap.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>To begin then with your pilfering&mdash;did you, or did you not, break open the pantry-door, and &s;teal out the great goo&s;e-pye?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Begging your pardon, Father, that was no fault of mine.</P>

<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The cook's, undoubtedly; for if he hadn't locked the pantry-door, 'tis an hundred to one I &s;houldn't have taken the trouble to break it open.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Non&s;en&s;e! Non&s;en&s;e!&mdash;I tell you, you've been guilty of &s;tealing, which is a mon&s;trous crime! And what did you &s;teal? Had you taken any thing el&s;e, I might have forgiven you: but to lay irreverent hands upon the goo&s;e-pye!&mdash;As I'm a Chri&s;tian, the identical goo&s;e-pye which I intended for my own &s;upper!&mdash;But this is not my only objection to your conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What principally offends me is, that you per|vert the minds of the maids, and keep ki&s;&s;ing and &s;muggling all the pretty girls you meet. Oh, fye! fye!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ki&s;s and &s;muggle them? St. Francis forbid! Lord love you, Father, 'tis they who ki&s;s and &s;muggle me. I prote&s;t I do what I can to pre&s;erve my mode&s;ty; and I wi&s;h that Archbi&s;hop Dun&s;tan had heard the lecture upon cha&s;tity which I read la&s;t night to the dairy-maid in the dark! he'd have been quite edified. But yet what does talking &s;ignify? The eloquence of my lips is counteracted by the lu&s;tre of my eyes; and really the little devils are &s;o tender, and &s;o trouble&s;ome, that I'm half angry with nature for hav|ing made me &s;o very bewitching.</P>

<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Non&s;en&s;e! Non&s;en&s;e!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it was but ye&s;terday that Cicely and Luce went to fifty-cuffs, quarrelling which looked neate&s;t, my red leg, or my yellow one. Then they are &s;o fond and &s;o coax|ing! They hang about one &s;o lovingly! And one &s;ays, "Kind Mr. Motley!" and t'other, "Sweet Mr. Mot|ley!"&mdash;Ah! Father Philip! Father Philip! How is a poor little bit of fle&s;h and blood, like me, to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch temp|tation?&mdash;Put your&s;elf in my place: Suppo&s;e that a &s;weet &s;miling rogue, ju&s;t &s;ixteen, with ro&s;y cheeks, &s;parkling eyes, pouting lips, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, fye! fye! fye!&mdash;To hear &s;uch licentious di&s;cour&s;e, brings the tears into my eyes!</P>

<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you, Father; for I &s;ee the water is run|ning over at your mouth. However, this &s;hews you&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;hews me that you are a reprobate, and that my advice is thrown away upon you: In future, I &s;hall keep tho&s;e coun&s;els to my&s;elf, which I offered you from motives of pure Chri&s;tian charity.</P>

<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charity, my good Father, &s;hould always begin at home: Now, in&s;tead of giving your&s;elf &s;o much trouble to mend me, what if you thought a little of correcting your&s;elf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>

<P>Gluttony?&mdash;Oh! abominable fal&s;ehood!</P>

<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plain matter of fact!&mdash;Why will any man pretend to &s;ay that you came hone&s;tly by that enormous belly, that tremendous tomb of fi&s;h, fle&s;h and fowl? I prote&s;t I'm grate|ful to Heaven, that among the unclean bea&s;ts who accompani|ed Noah, there went not into the ark a pair of fat monks: they mu&s;t infallibly have created a famine, and then the world would never have been re-peopled. Next, for incon|tinence, you mu&s;t allow your&s;elf that you are unequalled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I? I?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You, you. May I a&s;k what was your bu&s;ine&s;s in the beech-grove the other evening, when I caught you with buxom Margery the miller's pretty wife? Was it quite nece&s;&s;ary to lay your heads together &s;o clo&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly nece&s;&s;ary: I was whi&s;pering in her ear whole&s;ome advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed? Faith, then &s;he took your advice as kindly as it was given, and exactly in the &s;ame way too: you gave it with your lips, and &s;he took it with her's!&mdash;Well done, Father Philip!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Son, &s;on, you give your tongue too great a li|cen&s;e.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know they are very u&s;ele&s;s ones: and in &s;hort, Ma&s;ter Motley, to be plain with you, of all fools, I think you the wor&s;t; and for fools of all kinds I've an in|&s;uperable aver&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really? Then you have one good quality at lea&s;t,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, fool, I am going: but fir&s;t let me explain to you, that my bulk proceeds from no indulgence of voracious appetite: No, &s;on, no. Little &s;u&s;tenance do I take; but St. Cuthbert's ble&s;&s;ing is upon me, and that little pro&s;pers with me mo&s;t marvellou&s;ly. Verily, the &s;aint has given me rather too plentiful an increa&s;e, and my legs are &s;carce able to &s;upport the weight of his bounties.</P>

<P>Have you forgotten me?</P>

<P>Truly, Sir, that would be no ea&s;y matter: I never forgot in my life what I never knew.</P>

<P>Hey!&mdash;Can it be&mdash;Pardon, my dear ma&s;ter, pardon! In truth, you may well forgive my having forgotten <HI>your</HI> name, for at fir&s;t I didn't very well remember my own. However, to prevent further mi&s;takes, I mu&s;t inform you, that he who in your father's &s;ervice was Gilbert the knave, is Motley the fool in the &s;ervice of Earl O&s;mond.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of Earl O&s;mond? This is fortunate. Gilbert, you may be of u&s;e to me; and if the attachment which as a boy you profe&s;&s;ed for me &s;till exits.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does with ardes unabated; for I'm not &s;o un|ju&s;t as to attribute to you my expul&s;ion from Alnwic Ca&s;tle. In fact, I de&s;erved it; for I cannot deny but that at twenty I was as good-for-nothing a knave as ever exi&s;ted; con&s;e|quently old Earl Percy di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me from his &s;ervice, but I know that it was &s;orely again&s;t your inclination. You were
<PB N="7" REF="034000_0007_0FF9FDAC05006158">then &s;carce fourteen, and I had been your companion and play-fellow from your childhood. I remember well your grief at parting with me, and that you &s;lipped into my hand the pur&s;e which contained the whole of your little trea&s;ure. That act of kindne&s;s &s;truck to my heart: I &s;wore at the moment to love you through life, and if ever I forget my oath, damn me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>My hone&s;t Gilbert!&mdash;And what made you a&s;|&s;ume this habit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my Lord! what could I do? In &s;pite of my knavery and tricks, I was con&s;tantly upon the point of &s;tarving; and having once contracted an idle habit of eat|ing, I never could bring my&s;elf to leave it off. After living five years by my wits, want drove me almo&s;t out of them. I knew not what cour&s;e to take, when I heard that Earl Of|mond's je&s;ter had fled the country. I exerted my knavery for the la&s;t time in &s;tealing the fugitive's ca&s;t coat, was accept|ed in his place by the Earl, and now gain an hone&s;t liveli|hood by per&s;uading my neighbours that I'm a greater fool than them&s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And your change is for the better?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Infinitely; indeed your fool is unive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ally preferred to your knave&mdash;and for this rea&s;on; your fool is cheated, your knave cheats. Now every body had rather cheat than be cheated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some truth in that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, Sir, may I a&s;k, what brings you to Wales?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>A woman, whom I adore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I gue&s;&s;ed that the bu&s;ine&s;s was about a petti|coat. And this woman is&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>The orphan ward of a villager, without friends, without family, without fortune!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great points in her favour, I mu&s;t confe&s;s. And which of the&s;e excellen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ualities won your heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Percy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I had better rea&s;ons for be&s;towing it on her. No, Gilbert; I loved her for a per&s;on beautiful with|out art, and graceful without affectation; for an heart tender without weakne&s;s, and noble without pride. I &s;aw her at once beloved and reverenced by her village companions: they looked on her as a being of a &s;uperior order; and I felt, that &s;he who gave &s;uch dignity to the cottage maid, mu&s;t needs add new lu&s;tre to the coronet of the Percies.</P>

<P>That di&s;covery is &s;till unmade.

<P>Not by your de&s;cription; for here &s;he's under|&s;tood to be the daughter of Sir Malcolm Mowbray, my ma&s;|ter's decea&s;ed friend. And what is your pre&s;ent intention?</P>

<SP>

<P>To demand her of the Earl in marriage.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that will never do; for in the fir&s;t place you'll not be able to get a &s;ight of him. I've now lived with him five long years, and, till Angela's arrival, never witne&s;&s;ed a gue&s;t in the Ca&s;tle. Oh! 'tis the mo&s;t melancholy man|&s;ion! And as to its ma&s;ter, he's the very antidote to mirth. He always walks with his arms folded, his brows bent, his eyes lowering on you with a gloomy &s;cowl. He never &s;miles; and to laugh in his pre&s;ence would be high trea&s;on. He looks at no one, &s;peaks to no one. None dare approach him, except Kenric and his four blacks; all others are or|dered to avoid him; and whenever he quits his room, ding|dong goes a great bell, and away run the &s;ervants like &s;o many &s;cared rabbits.</P>

<P>Oh! rea&s;ons in plenty. You mu&s;t know there's an ugly &s;tory re&s;pecting the la&s;t owners of this Ca&s;tle. O&s;|mond's brother, his wife, and infant child, were murdered by a banditti, as it was &s;aid. Unluckily, the only &s;ervant who e&s;caped the &s;laughter, depo&s;ed, that he recognized among the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins a black &s;till in the &s;ervice of Earl O&s;mond. The truth of this a&s;&s;ertion was never known, for the &s;ervant was found dead in his bed the next morning.</P>

<P>Since that time, no &s;ound of joy has been heard in Conway Ca&s;tle. O&s;mond in&s;tantly became gloomy and fe|rocious; he now never utters a &s;ound except a &s;igh, has broken every tie of &s;ociety, and keeps his gates barred un|cea&s;ingly again&s;t the &s;tranger.</P>

<P>My &s;earch has been fruitle&s;s. In vain have I paced the river's banks, and pierced the grove's deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es. Nor glen nor thicket have I pa&s;&s;ed unexplored, yet found no &s;tranger to whom Kenric's de&s;cription could apply.</P>

<P>Hor&s;emen, &s;ay you? then Kenric may be right. Earl Percy has di&s;covered Angela's abode, and lurks near the Ca&s;tle in hopes of carrying her off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ha&s;&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>His hopes then will be vain. O&s;mond's vigilance will not ea&s;ily be eluded, &s;harpened by tho&s;e powerful mo|tives, love and fear.</P>

<P>If Percy gains her, every thing! Supported by &s;uch wealth and power, dangerous would be her claim to the&s;e domains &s;hould her birth be di&s;covered. Of this our Lord is aware; nor did he &s;ooner hear that Northumberland loved her, than he ha&s;tened to remove her from Allan's

<P>But as &s;he &s;till believes Percy to be a low-born &s;wain, when O&s;mond days <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his coronet at her feet, will &s;he reject his rank and &s;plendor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ha&s;&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>If &s;he loves well, &s;he will. Saib, I too have loved! I have known how painful it was to leave her on whom my heart hung! how incapable was all el&s;e to &s;upply her lo&s;s! I have exchanged want for plenty, fatigue for re&s;t, a wretched hut for a &s;plendid palace. But am I happier? Oh! no! Still do I regret my native land, and the partners of my poverty. Then toil was &s;weet to me, for I laboured for Samba; then repo&s;e ever ble&s;t my bed of leaves, for there by my &s;ide lay Samba &s;leeping.</P>

<P>Did it? Oh Saib; my heart once was gentle, once was good! But &s;orrows have broken it&mdash;in&s;ults have made it hard! I have been dragged from my native land! from a wife who was every thing to me, to whom I was every thing! Twenty years have elap&s;ed &s;ince the&s;e Chri&s;t|ians tore me away; they trampled upon my heart, mocked my de&s;pair; and, when in frantic terms I raved of Samba, laughed, and wondered how a negro's &s;oul could feel! In that moment, when the la&s;t point of Africa faded from my view, when as I &s;tood on the ve&s;&s;el's deck, I felt that all I loved was to me lo&s;t forever! In that bitter moment did I bani&s;h humanity from my brea&s;t! I tore from my arm the bracelet of Samba's hair, I gave to the &s;ea the precious token, and, while the high waves &s;wift bore it from me, vowed aloud endle&s;s hatred to mankind.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Motl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Willingly. You are to know, that &s;ince the late Earl's death, the Ca&s;tle is thought to be haunted; the &s;er|vants are fully per&s;uaded that his gho&s;t wanders every night through the long galleries, and parades the old towers and dreary halls which abound in this melancholy man&s;ion. He is &s;uppo&s;ed to be dre&s;t in a complete armour; and that which you wear at pre&s;ent was formerly his. Now hear my plan. The Earl prepares to hold a conference with Lady Angela; even now I heard her &s;ummoned to attend him in the Ar|moury. Placed upon this pede&s;tal, you may li&s;ten to their di&s;cour&s;e unob&s;erved, and thus form a proper judgment both of your mi&s;tre&s;s and her guardian. As &s;oon as it grows dark, I will conduct you to Angela's apartments: the ob|&s;curity will then &s;helter you from di&s;covery; and even &s;hould you be ob&s;erved, you will pa&s;s for Earl Reginald's &s;pectre.</P>

<P>I will not &s;acrifice my happine&s;s to her's! For &s;ix|teen long years have I thir&s;ted; and now, when the cup of joy again &s;tands full before me, &s;hall I da&s;h it from my lip? No, Angela, you a&s;k of me too much. Since the moment when I pierced her heart, deprived of whom life became odi|ous; &s;ince my &s;oul was &s;tained with his blood who loved me, with her's whom I loved, no form has been grateful to my eye, no voice &s;poken plea&s;ure to my &s;oul, &s;ave Angela's, &s;ave only Angela's! Doating upon one whom death has long cla&s;ped in his arms; tortured by de&s;ires which I never hop|ed to &s;atisfy, many a mournful year has my heart known no throb but of angui&s;h, no gue&s;t but remor&s;e at committing a fruitle&s;s crime. Hope, that &s;tranger, once more vi&s;its my bo&s;om: the fiend, who led me through pa&s;&s;ion's mazes to the heights of guilt, owns that a crime &s;o great well merits a reward. He bids the monument's jaws unclo&s;e: Evelina revives in her daughter, and &s;oon &s;hall the fires which con|&s;ume me be quenched in Angela's arms. What though her heart be Percy's? What though &s;he prefer a ba&s;ili&s;k's ki&s;s to mine? Becau&s;e my &s;hort-lived joy may cau&s;e her eternal &s;orrow, &s;hall I reject tho&s;e plea&s;ures &s;ought &s;o long, de&s;ired &s;o earne&s;tly? That will I not, by Heaven! Mine &s;he is,

<P>Oh! my good Lord, e&s;teem me not ungrateful! I acknowledge your bounties, but they have not made me hap|py.

The birds which my own hands reared, and the flowers which my own hands planted; the banks on which I re&s;ted when fatigued, the wild tangled wood which &s;upplied me with &s;trawberries, and the village church where I prayed to be virtuous, while I yet knew of vice and virtue but the name, all have acquired rights to my memory and my love!</P>

<P>Very true: But, Lord! if a man was always taken at his word, the world would &s;oon be turned up&s;ide down. When a polite gentleman begs you to con&s;ider his hou&s;e as your own, and a&s;&s;ures you that all he has is at your di&s;po&s;al, he'd be in a terrible &s;crape if you began knocking down his walls, or reque&s;ted the loan of his wife or daughters!&mdash;No, no, Sir, when I &s;aid that I &s;hould die in your &s;ervice with plea&s;ure, I intended to live in it many long years; &s;ince, to tell you the truth, from a child I had always a particular di&s;like to dying, and I think that with every hour the preju|dice grows &s;tronger.&mdash;Good my Lord, let us be gone.

I was &s;carce fifteen, when &s;he kindled a flame in my heare while lighting the kitchen fire, and from that moment I thought on nothing but her.

I wept her lo&s;s, and compo&s;ed an elegy upon it, which has been thought, by many per&s;ons of great judgment, not totally de&s;titute of ta&s;te and &s;ublimity. It began thus:
