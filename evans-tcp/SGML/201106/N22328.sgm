<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE Compiler of the following &s;heets, &s;en&s;ible that nothing new can be &s;aid upon the following intricate doc|trines of Prede&s;tination, Election and Reprobation, has no de|&s;ign to impo&s;e upon the Public&mdash;but in a plain, humble and conci&s;e manner, republi&s;h tho&s;e doctrines unveiled from that &s;ophi&s;try, art and prolixity, &s;o frequently experienced in mo|dern publications of this kind, from which the community at large can derive no benefit, for the want of time, education and &s;kill to trace the metaphy&s;ical &s;ubtilties of Calvinian wri|ters.</P>
<P>Therefore, that the humble enquirer after <HI>the truth as it is in</HI> JESUS, may not be lo&s;t in the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of human controver&s;y, but may be led, by proper motives, right views, upon rational principles, and by the plain declarations of <HI>God,</HI> to believe, and practice in that unadulterated faith, <HI>once delivered to the Saints,</HI> the following publication is offered to be tried by the touch&s;tone of <HI>Truth.</HI> And furthermore, that his fellow citi|zens may be &s;ecured, not only from the errors and violence of &s;ectari&s;ts and enthu&s;ia&s;ts, but may e&s;cape the vortex of in|fidelity, which, in the pre&s;ent age, like a <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iah,</HI> comes forth defying the SAVIOR of lo&s;t men. And painful it is, for the true Chri&s;tian, to hear <HI>"tyrannic dogmas"</HI> charged upon Chri&s;tianity, that have no exi&s;tence in the oracles of God.&mdash; To mention but one in&s;tance out of the many we have in a late Dei&s;tical publication, from the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Boulanger;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Entitled, Chri&s;tianity Unveiled.</NOTE> his words are as follows&mdash;" The fatali&s;m of the Grecian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as been transformed, in the hands of Chri&s;tian Prie&s;ts, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Pre|de&s;tination.

<P>That this kind of Prede&s;tination is the genuine offspring of heatheni&s;h fatality, is too obvious to need illu&s;tration;<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the great Palagian controver&s;y, in the 3d century, when Au&s;tin fir&s;t introduced it into the Chri&s;tian Church, di&s;puting with Palagius.</NOTE> but it is fal&s;e, and to the la&s;t degree cruel and ab&s;urd, when ei|ther called the dogma or doctrine of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>

<HEAD>THE SCRIPTURE DOCTRINE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE &s;cripture &s;aith,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;. i. 4.</NOTE> God <HI>hath cho&s;en us in</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>be|fore the foundation of the world, that we &s;hould be holy, and without blame before him in love.</HI> And St. Peter calls the &s;aints,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 2.</NOTE> <HI>elect according to the foreknowledge of</HI> God <HI>the Father, through &s;anc|tification of the &s;pirit, unto obedience.</HI> And St. Paul &s;aith unto them,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;&s;. ii. 13, 24.</NOTE> God <HI>hath from the beginning cho&s;en you to &s;alvation, through &s;anctification of the &s;pirit, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lief of the truth; whereunto he hath called you by our go&s;pel, to the ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ing of the glory of our</HI> Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. From all the&s;e places of &s;cripture it is plain that God had cho&s;en &s;ome to life and glory before, or from the founda|tion of the world. And the wi&s;dom of all Chri&s;tians is, to labour that their judgments may be informed herein, accord|ing to the &s;cripture. And to that end let us con&s;ider the manner of God's &s;peaking to the &s;ons of men.</P>
<P N="3">3. God &s;aith to <HI>Abraham,</HI> Rom. iv. 17. <HI>As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations, before him who believed, even</HI> God <HI>who quickeneth the dead and calleth things that are not as though they were.</HI> Ob&s;erve, God &s;peaks then, at that pre&s;ent time, to <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;aying, <HI>I have made thee a father of many nations,</HI> not|with&s;tanding Abraham was not at that time the father of one child, but <HI>I&s;hmael.</HI> How then mu&s;t we under&s;tand <HI>I have made thee a father of many nations?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The apo&s;tle tells us plainly, it was &s;o, <HI>Before</HI> God <HI>who calleth things that are not as though they were.</HI> And &s;o he calleth <HI>Abraham, the father of many nations,</HI> though he was not as yet the father even of <HI>I&s;aac, in whom his &s;eed was to be called.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. God u&s;eth the &s;ame manner of &s;peaking, when he calleth Chri&s;t,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xiii. 8.</NOTE> <HI>The lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world;</HI> although indeed he was not &s;lain for &s;ome thou&s;and years after. Hence therefore we may ea&s;ily under&s;tand what he &s;peaketh of <HI>elect|ing us from the foundation of the world.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. God calleth <HI>Abraham a father of many nations,</HI> though not &s;o at that time. He calleth <HI>Chri&s;t, The Lamb &s;lain from the foun|dation of the world,</HI> though not &s;lain till he was a man in the
<PB N="10" REF="029479_0009_0FE13B4A71077F98">fle&s;h. Even &s;o he calleth men <HI>Elected from the foundation of the world,</HI> though not elected till they were men in the fle&s;h.&mdash; Yet it is all &s;o before God, who knowing all things from eternity, <HI>calleth things that are not as though they were.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. By all which it is clear, that as Chri&s;t was called <HI>The Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world,</HI> and yet not &s;lain till &s;ome thou&s;and years after, till the day of his death; &s;o al&s;o men are called <HI>elect from the foundation of the world,</HI> and yet are not elected perhaps till &s;ome thou&s;and years after, till the day of their conver&s;ion to God.</P>
<P N="8">8. And indeed this is plain, without going farther, from tho&s;e very words of St. Peter, <HI>elect, according to the fore-know|ledge of</HI> God, <HI>through &s;anctification of the Spirit, unto obedience.</HI>&mdash; For,</P>
<P>If the elect are cho&s;en through &s;anctification of the Spirit, then they were not cho&s;en before they were &s;anctified by the Spirit. But they were not &s;anctified by the Spirit, before they had a being. It is plain then neither were they cho&s;en from the foundation of the world. But God <HI>calleth things that are not, as though they were.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. This is al&s;o plain from tho&s;e words of St. Paul, God <HI>hath from the beginning cho&s;en you to &s;alvation, through &s;anctification of the &s;pirit, and belief of the truth.</HI> Now,</P>
<P>If the &s;aints are cho&s;en to &s;alvation, through believing of the truth, and were called to believe that truth by the hear|ing of the go&s;pel, then they were not cho&s;en before they be|lieved the truth, and before they heard the go&s;pel, whereby they were called to believe. For they were cho&s;en through belief of the truth, and called to believe it by the go&s;pel.&mdash; Therefore they were not cho&s;en before they believed; much le&s;s before they had a being, any more than Chri&s;t was &s;lain before he had a being. So plain is it, that they were not elected, till they believed; although God <HI>calleth things that are not, as though they were.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Again, how plain is it, where St. Paul &s;aith, that they whom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;. i. 11, 12.</NOTE> God <HI>did prede&s;tinate, according to the council of his own will, to be the prai&s;e of his glory,</HI> were &s;uch as did <HI>fir&s;t tru&s;t in</HI> Chri&s;t? And in the very next ver&s;e, he &s;aith that they <HI>tru&s;ted in</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>after they heard the word of truth,</HI> (not before.)&mdash; But they did not hear the word before they were born.&mdash; Therefore it is plain, the act of election is <HI>in time,</HI> though known of God before; who, according to his knowledge, of|ten &s;peaketh of the things <HI>which are not, as though they were.</HI>&mdash; And thus is the great-&s;tumbling block about election taken away, that men may <HI>make their calling and election &s;ure.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. The &s;cripture tells us as plainly what prede&s;tination
<PB N="11" REF="029479_0010_0FE13B530F637FB8">is; it is God's fore-appointing obedient believers to &s;alva|tion, not without, but <HI>according to his fore-knowledge</HI> of all their works, <HI>from the foundation of the world.</HI> And &s;o likewi&s;e he prede&s;tinates or fore-appoints all di&s;obedient unbelievers to damnation, not without, but <HI>according to his fore-knowledge</HI> of all their works, <HI>from the foundation of the world.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. We may con&s;ider this a little farther. God from the foundation of the world, fore-knew all men's believing or not believing. And according to this his fore-knowledge, he cho&s;e or elected all obedient believers, as &s;uch, to &s;alvation, and refu&s;ed or <HI>reprobated</HI> all di&s;obedient unbelievers, as &s;uch, to damnation. Thus the &s;criptures teach us to con&s;ider <HI>elec|tion</HI> and <HI>reprobation, according to the fore-knowledge of</HI> God <HI>from the foundation of the world.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. But here &s;ome may object, that I hold our faith and obedience to be the cau&s;e of God's electing us to glory.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, I do hold, that faith in Chri&s;t producing obedi|ence to him is <HI>a cau&s;e without which</HI> God elected none to glory; for we never read of God's electing to glory, any who lived and died di&s;obedient unbelievers. But I do not hold, that it is the <HI>cau&s;e for which</HI> he elects any: the contrary of this is ea&s;ily &s;hewn thus:</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e my obedience is a cau&s;e of my election to &s;alvation, What is the cau&s;e of my obedience? <HI>An&s;.</HI> My love to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But what is the cau&s;e of my love to Chri&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> My faith in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But what is the cau&s;e of my faith in Chri&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The preaching of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But what is the cau&s;e of the preaching of the go&s;pel to us?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Chri&s;t's dying for us.</P>
<P>But what is the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t's dying for us?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> God's great love of pity wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins.</P>
<P N="14">14. Thus all men may &s;ee that I do not hold God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> any man to life and &s;alvation for any good which he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e, or for any which was in him, before he put it there. And this I &s;hall now &s;hew more at large from the oracles of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. God's great love of pity, where with he loved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ons of men, even while they were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, was the cau&s;e of his &s;ending his Son to die for them; as ap|pears from the following &s;criptures:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John iii. 16.</NOTE> God <HI>&s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, to the end that all who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eve in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life.</HI> For<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 6, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>when we were yet without &s;trength, in due time</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>died for the ungodly.</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="029479_0011_0FE13B584FED02D8">And, God <HI>commendeth his love to us, in that while we were yet &s;in|ners,</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>died for us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t's dying for our &s;ins is the cau&s;e of the go&s;pel's be|ing preached to us, as appears from tho&s;e &s;criptures,<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxviii. 18.</NOTE> Je&s;us <HI>came and &s;pake unto them, &s;aying, All power is given unto me in heaven and earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mark xvi. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Go ye into all the world and preach the go&s;pel to every creature.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The go&s;pel's being preached to &s;inners is the cau&s;e of their believing, as appears from tho&s;e &s;criptures,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 15, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>How &s;hall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how &s;hall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how &s;hall they hear without a preacher? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of</HI> God.</P>
<P N="4">4. Men's believing is the cau&s;e of their ju&s;tification, as ap|pears from tho&s;e &s;criptures,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Acts xiii. 39.</NOTE> <HI>By him all that believe are ju&s;tified from all things.</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 26, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>He is the ju&s;tifier of all that believe in</HI> Je&s;us. <HI>Therefore we conclude that a man is ju&s;tified by faith, without the deeds of the law.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 3, 23, &amp;c.</NOTE> Abraham <HI>believed</HI> God, <HI>and it was imputed to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s.

<P>To this al&s;o I &s;hall an&s;wer by the &s;criptures, &s;hewing 1. The te&s;timony of all the prophets. 2. Of the angel of God. 3. Of Chri&s;t him&s;elf. And, 4. Of his apo&s;tles.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> the prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;aith thus:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah liii. 4, 5, 6.</NOTE> <HI>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our Sorrows: yet did we e&s;teem him &s;tricken, &s;mit|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of</HI> God <HI>and afflicted.

And to him the te&s;timony of all the other pro|phets agreeth:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts x. 43.</NOTE> <HI>To give all the prophets witne&s;s, that through his name who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hall receive remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> The &s;ame &s;aith that great prophet, John the Bapti&s;t, who<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John i. 7.</NOTE> <HI>came to bear witne&s;s of the light, that</HI> all men <HI>through it might believe.</HI>&mdash;.

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> We come now to the words of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who knew his own bu&s;ine&s;s better than any man el&s;e; and there|fore if his te&s;timony agree with the&s;e, we mu&s;t needs be con|vinced that they are true.

<P N="18">18. What then can they, who deny this, &s;ay? Why, they commonly &s;ay, <HI>All men,</HI> in the&s;e &s;criptures, does not mean <HI>all men,</HI> but only <HI>the elect;</HI> that <HI>every man</HI> here does not mean <HI>every man,</HI> but only every one of the elect; that <HI>the world</HI> does not mean the <HI>whole world,</HI> but only the world of believers: and that the <HI>whole world,</HI> in St. John's words, does not mean <HI>the whole world,</HI> but only the whole world of the elect.</P>
<P N="19">19. To this &s;hamele&s;s, &s;en&s;ele&s;s eva&s;ion, I an&s;wer thus:</P>
<P>If the &s;cripture no where &s;peaks of a world of believers or elect, then we have no ground, rea&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, pretence, or excu&s;e for &s;aying, Chri&s;t d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed only for a world of believers or elect. But the &s;cripture no where &s;peaks of &s;uch a world. There|fore we have no ground or pretence for &s;peaking thus.</P>
<P>Nay, the &s;cripture is &s;o far from calling believers or elect|ed per&s;ons, <HI>the world,</HI> that they are every where in &s;cripture plainly and expre&s;sly di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>the world.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xv.</NOTE> <HI>If ye were of the world,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>the world would love its own; but becau&s;e I have cho&s;en you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. But let the &s;cripture it&s;elf &s;peak, what world Chri&s;t died for.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 6&mdash;10.</NOTE> <HI>When we were yet without &s;trength, Chri&s;t died for the ungodly. While we were yet &s;inners, Chri&s;t died for us. When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</HI> From all which we may clearly &s;ee, that Chri&s;t died for the world of the ungodly, for the world of &s;inners, for the world of his enemies; the ju&s;t one for the world of the unju&s;t. But the elect, as elect, are not unju&s;t. Therefore he died not for the elect, as elect; but even for that world St. John &s;peaks of, when he &s;ays, "The whole world lieth in wickedne&s;s."</P>
<P N="21">21. If it be &s;aid, "The elect were &s;inners once as well oth|ers:" I an&s;wer, true; but not as they are elect in Chri&s;t, but as they were out of Chri&s;t, without hope and without God
<PB N="16" REF="029479_0015_0FE13B7D1B016038">in the world. Therefore, to &s;ay that Chri&s;t died for the elect, as elect, is ab&s;olute non&s;en&s;e and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="22">22. To put this matter out of doubt, I would commend the&s;e following con&s;iderations to all &s;ober-minded men.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;cripture &s;aith, "Chri&s;t came to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;t."</P>
<P>But the elect, as elect, were not lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Therefore Chri&s;t died not for the elect, as or becau&s;e they were elect; for that had been to &s;eek and &s;ave what was found and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">d before.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;cripture &s;aith, Chri&s;t died for the unju&s;t.</P>
<P>But the elect, as &s;uch, are not unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Therefore, Chri&s;t died not for the elect, as elect; for that had been to ju&s;tify them who were ju&s;t before.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;cripture &s;aith, "He came to preach deliverance to the captives."</P>
<P>But the elect, as elect, are not captives; for Chri&s;t ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;et them free.</P>
<P>Therefore he died not for the elect, as elect; for that had been to &s;et them at liberty who were at liberty before.</P>
<P N="4">4. The &s;cripture &s;aith, "He quickeneth them who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, &s;uch as were without Chri&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lieus from the common wealth of I&s;rael, and &s;trangers to the cove|nant of promi&s;e, without hope and without God in the world.</P>
<P>But the elect, as &s;uch, are not dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, but alive unto God. Neither are they without Chri&s;t; for they are cho&s;en in him; nor are they aliens from the com|monwealth of I&s;rael, and &s;trangers to the covenant of pro|mi&s;e. But they are fellow-citizens with the faints, and the hou&s;hold of God.</P>
<P>Therefore Chri&s;t died not for the elect, as or becau&s;e they were elect. For that had been to quicken them that were alive before, and to bring them into covenant, who were in covenant before. And thus, by the&s;e means account our Lord lo&s;t his labour of love, and accompli&s;hed A SOLEMN NOTHING.</P>
<P N="23">23. Thus having &s;hewn the grievous folly of tho&s;e who &s;ay, that Chri&s;t died for none but the elect. I &s;hall now prove by undeniable rea&s;ons, that he died for all mankind.</P>

<P N="24">24. I &s;hall now briefly &s;hew the dreadful ab&s;urdities that follow from &s;aying Chri&s;t died only for the elect.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. If Chri&s;t died not for all, then unbelief is no &s;in in them that finally peri&s;h? &s;eeing there is not any thing for tho&s;e men to believe unto &s;alvation, for whom Chri&s;t died not.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If Chri&s;t died not for all, then it would be a &s;in in the greate&s;t part of mankind to believe he died for them; &s;eeing it would be to believe a lie.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If Chri&s;t died not for tho&s;e that are damned, then they are not damned for unbelief. Otherwi&s;e, you &s;ay, that they are damned for not believing a lie.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. If Chri&s;t died not for all, then tho&s;e who obey Chri&s;t by going and preaching the go&s;pel to every creature, as glad ti|dings of grace and peace, of great joy to all people, do &s;in thereby, in that they go to mo&s;t people with a lie in their mouth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. If Chri&s;t died not for all men, then God is not in earne&s;t in calling all men every where to repent; for what good could repentance do tho&s;e, for whom Chri&s;t died not?</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. If Chri&s;t died not for all, then why does he &s;ay he is not willing any &s;hould peri&s;h? Surely he is willing, yea, re&s;olv|ed that mo&s;t men &s;hould peri&s;h; el&s;e he would have died for them al&s;o.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. How &s;hall God judge the world by the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, if Chri&s;t did not die for the world? Or how &s;hall he judge them according to the go&s;pel, when there was never any go&s;|pel or mercy for them?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="25">25. But, &s;ay &s;ome, "If Chri&s;t died for all, why are not all &s;aved!"</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, Becau&s;e they believe not in the name of the only begotten Son of God. Becau&s;e God called, and they re|fu&s;ed
<PB N="18" REF="029479_0017_0FE13B88BAB5D8A0">to an&s;wer; he &s;tretched out his hand, and they regard|ed not; he coun&s;elled them, but they would none of his coun&s;els; he reproved them, but they &s;et at nought all his reproofs; they followed after lying vanities, and for&s;ook their own mercies; they denied the Lord that bought them, and &s;o brought upon them&s;elves &s;wift de&s;truction; and be|cau&s;e they received not the love of the truth, that they might be &s;aved, therefore (if you would know wherefore) God gave them up to believe a lie, and to be damned. How often (&s;aith our Lord) would I have gathered you together, and ye would not. Ye would not. Here is the plain rea&s;on, why all men are not &s;aved. For God promi&s;eth no man &s;alvation, whether he will or no; but, leaveth them to everla&s;ting de|&s;truction, who will not believe and obey the go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="26">26. "O, then you are an Arminian! You are a free-willer, You hold free-will in man!"</P>
<P>I hold nothing but what the &s;cripture &s;aith; and that you &s;hall give me leave to hold. I do not hold, that any man has any will or power of him&s;elf to do any thing that is good; but by the grace of God we may do all things. I have alrea|dy &s;hewn, he hath given Chri&s;t for all men. And he who &s;pared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how &s;hall he not with him freely give us all things? And what man knoweth not that if he make u&s;e of all the will and pow|er God hath given him, God will double his talent and give him more? If any therefore de&s;ire to have more, let him faithfully improve what he has. Likewi&s;e what man is he, who doth not know that he is not condemned for not doing what he could not do, but for leaving undone what he could have done if he would. Let any man deny it if he can.</P>
<P N="27">27. "What, then, may all men be &s;aved if they will?</P>
<P>Before I an&s;wer this que&s;tion directly, I &s;hall &s;hew that tho&s;e who a&s;k it, are them&s;elves compelled to grant as much freedom of will, as we de&s;ire to plead for.</P>
<P>For 1. The A&s;&s;embly of Divines, in their confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, c. 9. do expre&s;sly &s;ay, God "hath endowed the will of man with that natural liberty that it is neither forced, nor by any ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity determined to do good or evil."&mdash; 2. Mr. Baxter, in the preface of his call to the unconverted, &s;ays, "That Calvin as well as Arminius, held free-will, and that no man of brains denieth, that man hath a will that is naturally free; it is free from violence, it is a &s;elf-determin|ing principle." Sure here is as much &s;aid for free-will, as any man need to &s;ay, and perhaps more. For,</P>
<P>The difference between us, is this. They &s;ay, "Man hath a will which is naturally free." We &s;ay, "Man hath this freedom of will, not naturally, but by grace."</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="029479_0018_0FE13BB56C8C57B8">
We believe, that in the moment Adam fell, he had no freedom of will left; but that God, when of his own free grace he gave the promi&s;e of a Saviour to him and his po&s;ter|ity, graciou&s;ly re&s;tored to mankind a liberty and power to accept of proffered &s;alvation. And in all this, man's boa&s;ting is excluded; the whole of that which is good in him, even from the fir&s;t moment of his will, being of grace and not of nature. And now we come directly to the que&s;tion, whether all men may be &s;aved if they will?</P>
<P N="28">28. To tho&s;e who have con&s;idered what has been premi&s;ed; I an&s;wer, 1. What &s;hould hinder them, if they be willing? For, 2. God is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h; yea, 3. He is willing that all men &s;hould be &s;aved. And Chri&s;t is willing; for he "came not to judge the world, but to &s;ave the world." And how did he weep over Jeru&s;alem! How often would he have gathered them together, even as an hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but they would not?

<P>By Faith in Chri&s;t, who gave him&s;elf for <HI>me.</HI></P>

<P>But did he give him&s;elf for <HI>E&s;au</HI> and <HI>Judas?</HI> If not, you &s;ay, they are damned, for not believing a Lie.</P>
<P>This Con&s;ideration it was which forced Archbi&s;hop <HI>U&s;her</HI> to cry out.</P>
<P>"What would not a Man fly unto, rather than yield, that Chri&s;t did not die for the Reprobates; and that none but the Elect had any kind of Title to him: And yet many thou&s;ands &s;hould be bound to Con&s;cience to believe that he died for them, and died to accept him for their Redeemer and Savior? Whereby they &s;hould have believed that which in it&s;elf is mo&s;t untrue, and laid hold of that, in which they had no kind of Intere&s;t."</P>

<P>But what then do you mean by the Words <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Reprobation.</HI></P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean this. I&s;t. God did decree from the Begin|ning to elect or chu&s;e in (in Chri&s;t) all that &s;hould believe, to Salvation. And this decree proceeds from his own Goodne&s;s, and is not built upon any Goodne&s;s in the Creature. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y. God did from the Beginning decree, to reprobate all who &s;hould ob&s;tinately and finally continue in Unbelief.</P>

<P>What then do you think of <HI>ab&s;olute unconditional</HI> Elec|tion and Reprobation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it cannot be found in holy Writ, and this is a Plant which bears di&s;mal Fruit. An in&s;tance of which we have in <HI>Calvin</HI> him&s;elf; who confe&s;&s;es, that he procured the burning to Death of <HI>Michael Servantus</HI> a wi&s;e and holy Man, purely for differing from him in opinion, in matters of reli|gion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pred.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why do you call <HI>Servantus</HI> a <HI>Holy Man?</HI> does <HI>not</HI> Mr. <HI>Calvin</HI> him&s;elf &s;ay, that he was an <HI>Heretick,</HI> a <HI>Bla&s;phemer,</HI> an <HI>Athei&s;t,</HI> a <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Calvin him&s;elf</HI> does &s;ay &s;o; and many others up|on <HI>his</HI> Authority, who were, in effect, both Evidences, Judge and Jury again&s;t him, <HI>after</HI> his death, as well as <HI>before</HI> it.&mdash;But, you mu&s;t know, I cannot wholly rely on <HI>his</HI> Authority, any more than <HI>theirs,</HI> who only retail <HI>his</HI> words. I require fuller Evidence, a more impartial Jury, and a more Equita|ble Judge than Him, who had no more compa&s;&s;ion on his fel|low &s;ervant, than he &s;uppo&s;ed God to have on Infants of a Span long.</P>
