<P><HI>AN ACCOUNT</HI> OF THE Late Revolution in Geneva; AND OF THE CONDUCT OF FRANCE TOWARDS <HI>THAT REPUBLIC,</HI> From October, 1792, to October, 1794; IN A SERIES OF LETTERS, TO A CITIZEN OF PHILADELPHIA.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Letters, of which the following &s;heets contain a tran&s;lation, were addre&s;&s;ed to an Inhabitant of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> much about the time when the United States were threatened with a Revolution, upon the &s;ame princi|ples, with that which they de&s;cribe, but which the &s;pirit of the Government, and the enlightened zeal of the Peo|ple repre&s;&s;ed, before the unhappy experience of <HI>Geneva</HI> had &s;hewn the real nature and ultimate con&s;equences of it. They are the more worthy of attention, as the Author actually negociated, and &s;igned the Treaty men|tioned in the fir&s;t letter, with General <HI>Monte&s;quiou;</HI> and was an eye-witne&s;s to the fir&s;t part of the Revolu|tion, which the violation of that Treaty by the French introduced. To the pre&s;ent Edition, he has added &s;ome important facts, which either had not taken place, or were not known in <HI>England,</HI> when the former Editions were publi&s;hed, as well as &s;ome explanatory notes, which, he hopes, will not be thought unnece&s;&s;ary to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> reader.</P>
<P>When the Tran&s;lator fir&s;t read the&s;e Letters, he thought it would not be mis-&s;pending his time, to employ a few hours, in giving tho&s;e who do not under&s;tand the French language, an opportunity of receiving from them, &s;ome &s;hare of the plea&s;ure and in&s;truction they had afforded
<PB N="iv" REF="033927_0003_0FF9FA780EFF2838">him&s;elf; and he was the more encouraged to undertake the ta&s;k, as he ob&s;erved an unu&s;ual concurrence of opinion in tho&s;e who had read them, that a tran&s;lation might, at the pre&s;ent period, be as u&s;eful, as the originals them&s;elves are intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>In truth, the new political doctrines which have, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, been propagated in <HI>Europe,</HI> are &s;o well contrived to impo&s;e upon the imaginations, and to mi&s;|lead even the virtues of tho&s;e who li&s;ten to them, that it is not to be wondered at, if &s;ome, in this country, have received them with approbation, and at fir&s;t perhaps have felt a wi&s;h to &s;ee them reduced to practice. To &s;uch, it is hoped that the&s;e Letters will be in&s;tructive, as they exhibit the re&s;ult of the experiment in a country, in which it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, that it was not fairly tried. They &s;hew, as clearly as Hi&s;tory can illu&s;trate any pro|po&s;ition whatever, that the only object of tho&s;e who pro|pagate &s;uch doctrines, is, and ever will be, the attain|ment of their own &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es; that <HI>Liberty, Equality,</HI> and the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> are terms adopted by them, merely to gain credit with the People; and that every Revolution effected upon their principles, mu&s;t end as that of Geneva has ended, by putting all the power and all the wealth of the State into the hands of a few, who riot on the &s;poils of their Country, while the <HI>Sovereign People</HI> is left to amu&s;e the cravings of hunger, and the agonies of remor&s;e, with the rattles of <HI>Univer&s;al Suffrage,</HI> and <HI>perfect political Equality.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="033927_0003_0FF9FA780EFF2838">
It is true, that the &s;cale on which the experiment was tried, is? &s;mall one; but it is, perhaps, on that account better calculated to &s;hew the action of the &s;everal parts, and their connexion with each other.</P>
<P>It is certainly &s;ome excu&s;e for the friends of the Con|&s;titution and the people of property in <HI>Geneva,</HI> that they were borne down by the irre&s;i&s;tible weight of a Power which had previou&s;ly determined, that no effort of theirs to pre&s;erve their Con&s;titution, &s;hould be effectual. But no &s;uch apology can ever be offered for the people of this Country: if the Con&s;titution, and with the Con&s;ti|tution, the Liberty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> ever fall a &s;acrifice to the doctrines of <HI>Jacobini&s;m,</HI> it mu&s;t be her own fault. She has within her&s;elf a principle of &s;ecurity, which, if vigorou&s;ly exerted, will enable her to ride through the &s;torm, that threatens to wreck her neighbours. That prin|ciple is the active union, and &s;teady co-operation of all ranks of People in the Kingdom, to watch with vigilance and repre&s;s with &s;everity, the &s;lighte&s;t attempt to intro|duce, under whatever pretext, or for whatever purpo&s;e, any part of that baleful &s;y&s;tem into it.</P>
<P>In &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time as eighteen months did the Revolutionary Pe&s;tilence reduce the once-happy and flouri&s;hing <HI>Geneva,</HI> to a &s;tate of anarchy, mi&s;ery, and depopulation, of which modern Hi&s;tory affords no other example. And let not the people of this country forget that the fir&s;t &s;ymptom of the contagion was the adoption
<PB N="vi" REF="033927_0004_0FF9CC491D0CFF18">and u&s;e of the term <HI>Citizen:</HI> from the familiar e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of that term, it proceeded to the right of <HI>Uni|ver&s;al Suffrage,</HI> which was &s;oon followed by the Meet|ing of a <HI>National Convention,</HI> as the <HI>Convention</HI> was &s;uc|ceeded by a <HI>Central Club,</HI> and this <HI>Central Club</HI> by the erection of a <HI>Revolutionary Tribunal,</HI> which, after &s;u&s;pending the actual Government of the Country, and plundering, bani&s;hing, or putting to death, almo&s;t every man of property or principle within its reach, has at length e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;y&s;tem of de&s;poti&s;m, who&s;e wanton tyranny, and unprovoked cruelties, as completely refute the a&s;&s;ertion, that the barbarities perpetrated in <HI>France</HI> are to be imputed &s;olely to the combination formed again&s;t her, as the &s;hare taken by that Power in the petty Revolution of <HI>Geneva,</HI> expo&s;es the impudent hypocri&s;y of the pretence, that &s;he never interferes in the dome&s;tic concerns of other Nations.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AN account of the melancholy events which have lately taken place in Geneva, naturally addre&s;&s;es it&s;elf to you. You have ever taken the livelie&s;t intere&s;t in the affairs of that Republic, and are perfectly acquainted with the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e long and painful exertions by which &s;he originally acquired, and had, till now, pre&s;erved her Liberty. To you therefore a narrative of the manner in which &s;he has, perhaps for ever, lo&s;t it, cannot be unintere&s;ting; and may the fate of the mo&s;t democratical, and, at the &s;ame time, one of the mo&s;t happy States in the Old World, teach the inhabitants of the New, how feeble a barrier &s;eparates liberty from licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and how inevitably the abu&s;e of a ble&s;&s;ing leads to the lo&s;s of it!</P>
<P>I need not inform you, Sir, that, after a long &s;truggle, the Con&s;titutional Party at Geneva was obliged to yield, in 1782, to the irre&s;i&s;tible power of the Count <HI>de Ver|gennes.</HI> That Mini&s;ter took infinitely greater pains to cru&s;h democracy, at Geneva, than to e&s;tabli&s;h it, at the &s;ame period, in America: his intrigues, however, were defeated, and he was obliged to re&s;ort to more violent means. Some of the troops which had &s;erved in America, marched into the town, and after driving away the principal defenders of our fundamental Con&s;titution, erected on the ruins of it, not indeed an hereditary Ari&s;tocracy, but a form of Government, of which it is enough to &s;ay, that it required the con&s;tant &s;upport of foreign force, to maintain it again&s;t the declared aver&s;ion of by far the greater part of the people of Geneva. It was impo&s;&s;ible, however, that &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem could la&s;t longer than the Mini&s;ter who framed it; and accordingly, upon the death of <HI>De Vergennes,</HI> the very men who&s;e ambition he thought he had been gratifying in doing what he had done, concurred almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly in
<PB N="2" REF="033927_0005_0FF9FA870DFE32F8">de&s;troying it. Our ancient Republican Con&s;titution was triumphantly re&s;tored; its advocates were recalled, and rein&s;tated in their offices; and the long conte&s;t between the people and the admini&s;trative bodies, completely ter|minated in favour of the former.</P>
<P>This happy event was begun in 1789, and completed in 1791, and is in many re&s;pects one of the mo&s;t important in our hi&s;tory. It re&s;tored the cordial union, which had formerly pervaded every part of the State.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For all common purpo&s;es the Executive Power was lodged in two Councils, one of which, called the <HI>Little Council,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of 28 mem|bers, who, when elected, hold their &s;ituations for life; the other, or <HI>Great Council,</HI> was compo&s;ed of 250 members, who, by a law pa&s;&s;ed in 1791, were elected for &s;even years, and went out in rotation. The admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice was entru&s;ted to the <HI>Little Council,</HI> under the direction of 4 Pre&s;idents or <HI>Syndics,</HI> annually elected out of it, and &s;ub|ject to an appeal in mo&s;t ca&s;es to the <HI>Great Council:</HI> but the &s;upreme &s;overeign authority of the State re&s;ided wholly and exclu&s;ively in the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> of the People, which was compo&s;ed of &s;uch as inherited or had purcha&s;ed the title of <HI>Citizens.</HI> Such de&s;cendants of foreigners as were not entitled to the privileges of that character, were called <HI>Na|tives,</HI> and, by a law pa&s;&s;ed in 1791, might be admitted to them on pay|ment of a &s;mall fine; but the number of citizens by birth was &s;o great, and the fine by the payment of which the natives became citizens, was &s;o incon&s;iderable, that nearly three fourths of the Geneve&s;e who were of age, and in &s;olvent circum&s;tances, were members of the General A&s;&s;embly.
<P>This &s;overeign Body, thus compo&s;ed, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole legi&s;lative power of the State: it elected all the magi&s;trates, all the officers of State, and all the members of the two Councils; it made peace, and declared war; it ratified treaties with foreign Powers, and impo&s;ed taxes. But at the &s;ame time it exerci&s;ed the&s;e important prerogatives under re&s;trictions which prevented the inconveniences naturally ari&s;ing from &s;o democratical a Con&s;titution; for it could be convened by none but the Syndics and the two Councils; it could enter upon no bu&s;ine&s;s but &s;uch as they laid before it; no bu&s;ine&s;s could be laid before it which had not previou&s;ly been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and approved in each of the Councils; and finally, it had no power but of &s;imply a&s;&s;enting to, or di&s;&s;enting from, what was laid before it, without modification, and without debate.</P>
<P>Such was the Con&s;titution of Geneva, when the attack which is the &s;ubject of the following narrative was made upon it; and &s;uch it had been ever &s;ince the reformation, with the exception of &s;uch momentary interruptions as naturally happen, and are to be expected, in a State where almo&s;t every member of the community has, and any member of it may ea&s;ily have, a &s;hare in the Government. The &s;alutary re&s;trictions and judicious modifications which I have mentioned, had by degrees ripened the Con&s;titution of Geneva into what Rou&s;&s;eau thought the <HI>Sublime&s;t work of political wi&s;dom</HI> which the world had ever &s;een. The French affect to idolize the memory of Rou&s;&s;eau, in who&s;e opinion "<HI>the mo&s;t perfect liberty is dearly purcha&s;ed by the effusion of a &s;ingle drop of blood."</HI> What would he have thought of his wor&s;hippers, had he lived to &s;ee the object of his greate&s;t reverence, and mo&s;t affectionate attach|ment, made the fir&s;t &s;acrifice on the bloody altars of a &s;y&s;tem of which they call him the author?</P></NOTE> Our com|merce and manufactures flouri&s;hed; and our Univer&s;ity, the copious &s;pring of all our pa&s;t and pre&s;ent enjoyments, communicated a &s;pirit of exertion and enterpri&s;e to the arts and &s;ciences, which was not exceeded, in the mo&s;t populous and exten&s;ive kingdoms. Such was, and &s;uch indeed had been the pro&s;perity of Geneva, that, within the pre&s;ent century, our population had doubled, our wealth had increa&s;ed in a ten-fold proportion, knowledge was very generally diffu&s;ed, and foreigners &s;aw with equal plea&s;ure and a&s;toni&s;hment, that in a di&s;trict, who&s;e inha|bitants did not exceed thirty thou&s;and, there were, at the &s;ame period, as many men of eminence in the arts, in
<PB N="3" REF="033927_0005_0FF9FA870DFE32F8">polite literature, and in &s;cience, as in any one of the three northern kingdoms of Europe: Such were the con&s;e|quences of freedom and a good &s;y&s;tem of education.</P>
<P>But this plea&s;ing pro&s;pect was of very &s;hort duration; and our liberty had hardly begun to recover from the blow it had lately received, when another attack was made upon it from the &s;ame quarter, but under a different name; it was made under the &s;acred name of <HI>Liberty</HI> it&s;elf, and with it has, I fear, for ever de&s;troyed all the re&s;pectable qualities, and elevated virtues, which nouri&s;h and &s;upport it. In &s;hort, the French had no &s;ooner re&s;olved, in 1792, to attack the King of Sardinia, than we received intelli|gence from Paris, on which we could depend, that General <HI>Monte&s;quiou;</HI> who was to command the expedition again&s;t him, had received &s;ecret orders, of a nature very ho&s;tile to Geneva. The&s;e orders were given by the Bri&s;&s;otins, who, it is well known, had projected a plan of &s;urrounding France with a <HI>zone of Republics,</HI> formed on the &s;ame prin|ciples with it&s;elf. Savoy was de&s;tined to form one of tho&s;e Republics, and Geneva was to be a capital of it; an honour, which it was to purcha&s;e, at the expence of its own newly-recovered Con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="033927_0006_0FF9FA8BB0775170">
The Swi&s;s, our ancient and faithful Allies, prepared to &s;hare our danger; and the moment they were applied to, &s;ent 1600 men to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Indeed no time was to be lo&s;t; for General Monte&s;quiou advanced towards Geneva the very day after that on which he entered Savoy. His orders (which have &s;ince been publi&s;hed) were, that, <HI>as the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Geneva was e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ecurity of Savoy, be was to enter it, (by force if nece&s;&s;ary) and take</HI> 20,000 <HI>mu&s;kets which were in it, and of which the French Republic was in need.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The letter of <HI>Servan,</HI> the Mini&s;ter at War, dated October 3. 1792, concluded with the&s;e words:&mdash;<HI>If you are told that the&s;e mu&s;kets are nece&s;|&s;ary for the defence of the town, you may remove their apprehen&s;ions, by leaving them</HI> 4 <HI>or</HI> 5000 <HI>men to take care of them. You may thus convert Geneva into a barrier of the Republic.</HI>
<P>In a letter written but four days before, he ordered Monte&s;quiou to march towards Geneva, <HI>in order to give freedom of action to the friends of Liberty, who were in con&s;iderable numbers there, and to e&s;tabli&s;h a form of Government &s;uitable to their wi&s;hes.</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P>Our Allies, however, had time enough to throw them|&s;elves into the town, before the French had completely &s;ur|rounded it. On the 5th day of October 1792, the Depu|ties, whom we had &s;ent to enquire into the cau&s;e of this unexpected attack, were told by the French Commander, <Q>That the Government of Geneva had in&s;ulted the French Republic, by calling in the aid of the Swi&s;s, to repel an attack which was never intended to be made, and which nothing but that &s;tep had &s;ugge&s;ted; that the Magi&s;trates of Geneva were (perhaps without meaning it) the abettors of the enemies of France, and (as a proof of their ill-will towards her) had permitted &s;ome of the Emigrants to &s;ettle in Geneva, and others to pa&s;s through it, in making their retreat into other countries.</Q></P>
<P>To this charge our Deputies an&s;wered, that di&s;tru&s;t is the only &s;ecurity of the weak, in their intercour&s;e with the &s;trong. They appealed to a letter written by one of the French Mini&s;ters &s;everal days before the application to the Swi&s;s, in which, without &s;eeming to think it probable, or even po&s;&s;ible, that the Geneve&s;e would make any re&s;i&s;tance; and as if his intention had been to prepare them for &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="5" REF="033927_0006_0FF9FA8BB0775170">he informed them of the re&s;olutions taken again&s;t them.&mdash;They ju&s;tified their application to the Swi&s;s, by many precedents; and &s;hewed, that whenever Savoy be|came the &s;cene of war, Geneva had always claimed, and as regularly received, their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; that the right of taking that &s;tep, which, after all, was only a precaution to prevent po&s;&s;ible evil, was acknowledged in many &s;olemn treaties, of which France her&s;elf was the guarantee, and had never given offence to any of her Monarchs, not even to Lewis XIV. in who&s;e reign it had been re&s;orted to, as often as was thought nece&s;&s;ary; and as a farther proof of the innocence of our intentions, they reminded the General, that we were at that moment the only &s;overeign State which had acknow|ledged the French Republic; that, at the very beginning of the Revolution, we had opened our granaries, for the relief of one of their di&s;tricts, again&s;t the pre&s;&s;ure of a &s;carcity, to which we our&s;elves were equally impo&s;ed; and that, when that di&s;trict was apprehen&s;ive of a kind of counter-revolution, and had applied to us for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we had furni&s;hed it with arms, which &s;o far from being returned to us, as had been &s;olemnly promi&s;ed, were now to be employed again&s;t us.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments, unan&s;werable as they were, would have been of little avail, had they not been &s;upported by all the influence, and all the abilities of the upright and honourable man, to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed. In his report to the French Mini&s;try, he &s;tated the danger, as well as folly, of involving France in a di&s;pute with the whole Helvetic Body, which would certainly exert all its force to repel an attack, that, con&s;idering the comparative &s;trength of the two parties, would do &s;o little honour to the magnanimity of the a&s;&s;ailants. He repre&s;ented this &s;o &s;trongly, that his orders were countermanded, and he was directed to negociate an amicable arrangement, in which <HI>he was to u&s;e his whole addre&s;s again&s;t us, and at all events, to conclude the negociation in the &s;ame manner as if he had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the town by force, by leaving a French garri&s;on behind him.</HI> He again remon&s;trated, and at length received full powers: a treaty was concluded on the 22d of October, on terms equally honourable to both parties,
<PB N="6" REF="033927_0007_0FF9FA9833F70638">by which, after &s;tating, that the mi&s;under&s;tanding which had taken place between the two Republics, had been explained in the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t &s;atisfactory manner, it was agreed, that the French army &s;hould retire to the di&s;tance of ten leagues, and the Republic di&s;mi&s;s the troops of its allies.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the treaty was &s;igned, the French Re&s;ident returned into the town, and in the name of the nation he repre&s;ented, gave us the <HI>mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances of unalterable friend&s;hip.</HI> In con&s;equence of the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, we not only ratified, but had actually begun to fulfil the treaty on our part, when we were informed that the French Mini&s;try re|fu&s;ed to &s;anction it, unle&s;s &s;ome clau&s;es were in&s;erted, which Mr. <HI>Gene&s;t</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fame per&s;on who was afterwards &s;ent in a public character to America, and who, if he is there &s;till, will not deny the truth of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions.</NOTE> was &s;ent to negociate. We were, as you may imagine, &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;uch conduct; but by the advice of our Allies, and on con&s;idering the nature of our &s;ituation, we accepted of the additional articles, and a new treaty was &s;igned. But what was our a&s;toni&s;hment, when we were again informed, that this &s;econd treaty, which <HI>Le Brun,</HI> the Mini&s;ter for foreign affairs, con&s;idered as unexceptionable, and earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed the Convention to ratify, was, after many affected delays, violently attacked on the 21&s;t of No|vember, by <HI>Bri&s;&s;ot,</HI> at the head of the Diplomatic Com|mittee, and &s;tigmatized as an <HI>igneminious capitulation?</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This treaty, this <HI>ignominious capitulation</HI> (as it was called), was &s;igned on the 2d of Nov. by <HI>F. A. P. Monte&s;quiou, J. F. Prevo&s;t, A. Lullin,</HI> and <HI>F. D'Ivernois,</HI> and begins with &s;tating the circum&s;tances that had led to the mi&s;under&s;tanding between the two Republics, and the mea&s;ures taken to remove it. It then proceeds thus: <Q>The Plenipotentiary of the French Nation declares, in the name of his Con&s;tituents,&mdash;that the country he repre&s;ents, is equally incapable of fearing her enemies, or of making a bad u&s;e of victory; and con&s;idering how recently &s;he re|&s;tored, in the very moment of conque&s;t, a conquered nation (Savoy) to it&s;elf, it is unrea&s;onable to &s;u&s;pect her of any intention to attack the liberty of a nation, to which &s;he was bound by ties of alliance. Tho&s;e calculations of comparative &s;trength, which De&s;pots are &s;o much in the habit of making, and by the re&s;ult of which they are induced either to attack, or to de&s;i&s;t from attacking their neighbours, will never be re|&s;orted to by a people which has founded its own Rights upon the broad and comprehen&s;ive ba&s;is of the <HI>Rights of Man.</HI> The French Republic has re&s;i&s;ted the interference of other nations in her dome&s;tic affairs, even at the expence of her own blood: &s;he feels therefore &s;ome degree of pride in declaring, that &s;he has not the mo&s;t remote intention to introduce her troops either into the town, or any part of the territory of Geneva. Nor does &s;he mean to a&s;&s;ume the &s;malle&s;t authority with her, or exert any kind of influence over her Government. If there|fore, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, &s;he requires of the Magi&s;trates of Geneva, to be contented with the means they have within their own walls, for defending the town, and &s;ecuring obedience t&ouml; the laws, it is becau&s;e &s;he con&s;iders that line of conduct as indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for the pre|&s;ervation of the liberty of Geneva, as well as for the continuance of the neutrality which its magi&s;trates have adopted, and which it is &s;o much their intere&s;t to ob&s;erve with &s;crupulous exactne&s;s. In &s;hort, the intentions and views of France, have been &s;o often and &s;o di&s;tinctly declared, that it is impo&s;&s;ible a free people can doubt their &s;incerity. Tyrants only, and the abettors of tyranny, dare call them in que&s;|tion.</Q>
<P><Q>The Plenipotentiaries of Geneva, on behalf of the Syndics and Council, declared, That having the honour to be the Magi&s;trates of a free people, they neither now, nor at any future time, will acknow|ledge any judge of their conduct, but God and their Countrymen.

<PB N="7" REF="033927_0007_0FF9FA9833F70638">The con&s;equence of this attack was, that the Convention refu&s;ed to ratify it, and by a &s;hort decree peremptorily re|quired of us <HI>to di&s;mi&s;s the troops of the Swi&s;s by the 1&s;t of December; in which ca&s;e, it promi&s;ed that tho&s;e of France &s;hould re&s;pect our independence and evacuate our territory, if any part of it had been occupied by them.</HI></P>
<P>The language of Bri&s;&s;ot on this occa&s;ion is perhaps the mo&s;t &s;triking in&s;tance afforded by the whole Revolution, of the real nature and genuine character of the principles on which the French conduct them&s;elves, in their intercour&s;e with other nations.</P>
<P><Q>In truth, &s;ays he, the Republic of <HI>Geneva</HI> either has, or has not confidence in our integrity. If &s;he has, &s;he will be &s;atisfied with our bare promi&s;e to re&s;pect her in|dependence: if &s;he has not, the formality of a treaty can|not add to her &s;ecurity.

<P><Q>The only que&s;tion, therefore, for your con&s;ideration, is whether <HI>a free people either can or ought to bind it&s;elf by Treaties, and whether every Treaty is not as unnece&s;&s;ary with Republics, as it is indecent with every other form of Government which does not derive its authority immediately from the People.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is to be ob&s;erved that, in this report, Bri&s;&s;ot, after attempting to &s;ix upon us as a crime, that we had included our&s;elves in the neutrality of the Helvetic Body, which he called <HI>an ill-di&s;gui&s;ed acce&s;&s;ion to the com|bination of De&s;pots,</HI> urged again&s;t us with &s;till more vehemence, the con|cern which the King of Great-Britain generou&s;ly took in our affairs, at &s;o critical a moment.
<P>Lord R. Fitzgerald, the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter in Switzerland, had written from Berne, on the 8th of October, to the Syndies and Council of Geneva, a&s;&s;uring them of the good-will of his Britannic Maje&s;ty, and of his earne&s;t wi&s;hes for the continuance of the tranquillity, liberty and inde|pendence of their Republic, which were &s;o intimately connected with the quiet and happine&s;s of the whole Helvetic Body. "And I have no doubt," continued he, <Q>that his Maje&s;ty will entirely approve of the &s;teps you have taken, which are ju&s;tified by ancient u&s;age and &s;olemn treaties, and are &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of the neutrality ob&s;erved by the Helvetic Union; a line of conduct to which, I am &s;ure, you want no per&s;ua&s;ions of mine to induce you to adhere.</Q></P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;ot commented on this letter, in the cour&s;e of his report, in the fol|lowing manner:</P>
<P><Q>The Ari&s;tocrats of Geneva have re&s;orted to other &s;tratagems. They have endeavoured (and not-without &s;ucce&s;s), to excite the Cabinet of London again&s;t us, and have procured a Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary to be &s;ent to Geneva, to a&s;&s;ure them, that the King of Great-Britain is inte|re&s;ted in their &s;ituation, and approves of their conduct. Doubtle&s;s the people of Great-Britain will hear, <HI>with indignation,</HI> that its influence has been employed in protecting the ari&s;tocracy of a few intriguers, and in cru&s;hing the freedom of a whole people. <HI>Doubtle&s;s, it will call tho&s;e who have dared to profane its name for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, to a rigid account.</HI> But be that as it may, the French Republic will not retract. The appearance of a King upon the &s;tage will not terrify us; nor &s;hall the farce in which he is to be introduced, retard our ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>This part of the report was as much applauded as any other; and it is worth remarking that it was delivered in the Convention preci&s;ely <HI>two</HI> months before Mr. Chauvelin received orders to leave London.</P></NOTE> <HI>On the manner in which this que&s;tion
<PB N="9" REF="033927_0008_0FF9FAA32C4BA538">is an&s;wered, the fate not only of our own Revolution, but of tho&s;e which are to follow it, will depend.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that with a view to prepare the minds of the public for this Report, and to give an appear|ance of decency to &s;o gro&s;s a violation of the Law of Nations, the Bri&s;&s;otin party had taken care, &s;ome days before, to ob|tain an order from the Convention to arre&s;t <HI>Monte&s;quiou,</HI> and to bring him to Paris, to an&s;wer for his conduct.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This decree was the natural con&s;equence of the boldne&s;s, with which he had, all along, reprobated their conduct towards the Geneve&s;e. Not &s;atisfied with pleading their cau&s;e in his official corre&s;pondence with the Mini&s;ter for Foreign Affairs, he wrote in the following terms, on the 7th of October, to <HI>Garat,</HI> the Mini&s;ter of Ju&s;tice, of whom he enter|tained a better opinion than of his colleagues: <Q>I conjure you not to follow the infamous example of De&s;poti&s;m; I call upon your pure and Republican heart, not to &s;hut your ears to the indignant voice of an hone&s;t man. Exert all the vigour of real virtue in behalf of oppre&s;&s;ed Geneva, and do not fuffer our country to be di&s;graced by a wanton and abominable abu&s;e of power.</Q>
<P>In a letter of the &s;ame date, to <HI>Vergniaux,</HI> the leading Member of the Convention, he &s;ays, <Q>I am acting a part equally di&s;honourable to my country and to my&s;elf. When I was ordered to negociate with the Geneve&s;e, I thought that the fir&s;t diplomatic act of the French Republic, &s;hould bear upon the face of it, the &s;tamp of true greatne&s;s; I mean, moderation and ju&s;tice. I laid out of my con&s;ideration, the comparative power, and &s;trength, of the two nations: I rai&s;ed Geneva, in my own imagination, to the level of France, and remembered only, that one free people was treating with another. The treaty was concluded, &s;igned, and tran&s;mitted to Paris. With equal &s;urpri&s;e and indignation, I learned, that the &s;pirit, not of true greatne&s;s, but of childi&s;h vanity, had cavilled at &s;ome of the articles of it, and that I mu&s;t propo&s;e alterations. I obeyed; and &s;uch was the confidence my former conduct had in&s;pired, that tho&s;e alterations were accepted. Ye&s;terday, however, I received a letter from the Mini&s;ter at War, directing me to make new preparations for ho&s;tility: again, I have obeyed, and I hope that the readine&s;s of my obedience will &s;ilence the calumnies, which my enemies circulate, &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly, again&s;t me. But will You, Sir, you who are a man of talents and virtue&mdash;will You &s;uffer the infancy of a Republic, on which the eyes of the Univer&s;e are fixed, to be polluted by the foul perfidy of Courts? Will you di&s;grace your darling Country, by the &s;candalous repetition of the fable of the Wolf and the Lamb? Will it add to our honour, or to our power, to cru&s;h the feeble&s;t of our neighbours, to violate the mo&s;t &s;acred rule of univer&s;al ju&s;tice, and to plunge our&s;elves into an addi|tional war? If I can avert &s;uch a di&s;grace from my Country, by awakening the feelings of an hone&s;t man, I &s;hall do a virtuous action, and you will be worthy of the name of Frenchman. I am alarmed, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, at the thought of being made the in&s;trument of an act of perfidy, which the Mini&s;ters would never have thought of, had they known the whole truth; I call upon you, Sir, whom I know to be a man of honour, to declare it to them, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>He had already given the Mini&s;ters his opinion of their conduct, in the mo&s;t unequivocal terms. It is, &s;aid he, the exact counterpart of that of the Duke of Brun&s;wick; and your in&s;tructions, a mere copy of his Manife&s;to. This reproach was too ju&s;t, not to be deeply felt, and as deeply re&s;ented: he was immediately accu&s;ed, in the Convention, of having <HI>betrayed the intere&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>&s;acrificed the honour of his country,</HI> in the treaty he had negociated with us; <HI>of having chained down the valour of his troops, and di&s;graced the French name, by granting terms to the Ari&s;to|crates of Geneva, which a handful of his countrymen had refu&s;ed to Brun&s;|wick, and his numerous cohorts.</HI></P>
<P>Not a &s;ingle voice was heard, in the Convention, in his favour, nor did any friend dare to inform him of the danger that awaited him. Hap|pily the indi&s;cretion of the me&s;&s;enger who was &s;ent to &s;eize him, gave the Geneve&s;e an opportunity of making him &s;ome return, for the &s;ervices he had rendered them, by facilitating his e&s;cape, which he had the good fortune to effect on the 14th of November. See <HI>M&eacute;moirs Ju&s;ticati&s; pour le Citoyen Fran&ccedil;cis, A P. Monte&s;quiou, G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l' Arm&eacute; des Alpes, adre&s;&s;e au Pr&eacute;&s;ident de la Convention, Novembre,</HI> 1792.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Unfortunately, that part of their demands which related to the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the Swi&s;s, it was no longer in our power to di&s;pute; as our Allies had, on the faith of the two treaties, &s;u&s;pended their military preparations, and recalled the greater part of their troops. The nece&s;&s;ity of our &s;itua|tion left us no choice; we con&s;ented therefore to the de|parture
<PB N="10" REF="033927_0009_0FF9CC64B564D2C0">of the re&s;t, and flattered our&s;elves that our oppre&s;|&s;ors would be &s;atisfied, and that we had now nothing more to apprehend.</P>
<P>But we were mi&s;taken; a danger, much greater than any we had encountered, threatened us. General <HI>Monte&s;quiou,</HI> having had the good fortune to make his e&s;cape, informed us, that it was the determination of the French Mini&s;try, to leave no means untried, for effecting a Revolution at <HI>Geneva,</HI> on the &s;ame principles as that of <HI>France;</HI> and that we had no alternative but to anticipate them, or feel the con&s;equences of their interference.</P>
<P>It was difficult for us to conceive, how we could make our Government more democratical, than it then was; &s;ince every free-man of <HI>Geneva</HI> exerci&s;ed, in his own per&s;on, tho&s;e powers, which the <HI>French,</HI> from their numbers, had
<PB N="11" REF="033927_0009_0FF9CC64B564D2C0">been obliged to intru&s;t to repre&s;entatives. But unfortunately for us, the Bri&s;&s;otins, who then were the prevailing party at <HI>Paris,</HI> had lately &s;ucceeded in removing the di&s;tinction between <HI>active</HI> and <HI>inactive</HI> citizens; and repealing the law which re&s;erved the civil and military offices of the country, as well as the right of electing to them, to tho&s;e who had &s;ome property in it; a wi&s;e and &s;alutary principle, and which, if it had been &s;teadily maintained, would, undoubt|edly, have prevented a great deal of the mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s, which the violation of it has brought upon <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But having de&s;troyed that important di&s;tinction in their own Con&s;titution, the Bri&s;&s;otins &s;oon found out an effectual mode of overturning it in ours; for as, by our Con&s;titution, none were admitted into the General A&s;&s;embly, but &s;uch as inherited, or had acquired the title of <HI>Citizen,</HI> they rai&s;ed a clamour again&s;t that di&s;tinction, and branded the A&s;&s;embly it&s;elf with the epithets of <HI>ari&s;tocratical</HI> and <HI>hereditary,</HI> which they had contrived to make &s;o odious. So far, however, was that Body from de&s;erving tho&s;e epithets, that, as has been already mentioned, more than two thirds of the Gene|ve&s;e were, at that moment, members of it, and any of the re&s;t might be admitted into it, upon payment of a fine &s;o &s;mall,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In favour of the children of aliens born at Geneva, this fine was by degrees reduced to about &s;ix pounds &s;terling, and was part of the funds of the ho&s;pitals, the ar&s;enals, and other in&s;titutions of public utility which had been founded by the Geneve&s;e in former ages.</NOTE> as in fact to be below the rate nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ecuring the independence of an elector, much more of a member of the Legi&s;lature it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Natives,</HI> who, as I have already ob&s;erved, were at Geneva what the cla&s;s of <HI>inactive Citizens</HI> was in France, had, on the late inva&s;ion, &s;hewn them&s;elves extremely zea|lous in the defence of the Republic: and, indeed, with the exception of about fifty individuals, partly Citizens and partly Natives, who on the approach of the French had ba&s;ely de&s;erted their po&s;ts, on pretence that, as friends to liberty, they ought not to oppo&s;e them&mdash;with this &s;mall exception, all the Geneve&s;e breathed, on that occa&s;ion, the &s;ame affectionate attachment to their coun|try,
<PB N="12" REF="033927_0010_0FF9FAC1883735E0">and were all animated with the &s;ame intrepid re&s;olution of dying in its defence. Indeed, the patriotic &s;pirit &s;hown on that occa&s;ion, is one of the mo&s;t brilliant, as I fear it is one of the la&s;t in&s;tances of the di&s;play of that virtue, to be found in our hi&s;tory; for, no &s;ooner was it under&s;tood that war was declared again&s;t us, for having pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t decree, by which Government had been directed to call in the 1600 Swi&s;s, than a &s;econd decree was made, and &s;ent, by order of the General A&s;&s;embly, to the French General, by which it was empowered to call in, as many more, as it might think nece&s;&s;ary; and, on being informed, that the French Mini&s;try affected to treat tho&s;e decrees as contrivances of our magi&s;trates, who, they in&s;i&s;ted, &s;hould be puni&s;hed for &s;uch <HI>perver&s;e</HI> and <HI>traitorous</HI> behaviour, the whole body of our national militia met, in arms, on the 10th day of October, and communicated to tho&s;e Magi&s;trates, its entire approbation of their conduct, to|gether with the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances of the firme&s;t &s;upport.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Magi&s;trates &s;howed them&s;elves worthy of the confidence, and attachment of their fellow-citizens. They immediately wrote a letter to <HI>Le Brun,</HI> who was then Mini&s;ter for Foreign Affairs, in which, after fully di&s;proving every charge brought again&s;t them, they offered their own lives and fortunes, if &s;uch a &s;acrifice would pre&s;erve the indepen|dence of their country: "nay," &s;aid they, <Q>we will ble&s;s the hand, which takes them from us, if, by lo&s;ing them, we can tran&s;mit, to our children, the liberty we have received, from our forefathers; we will ble&s;s the hand, which, by &s;acrificing us, averts the &s;torm that &s;eems to hang over the Helvetic Body, and the French Republic, and &s;aves the latter the indelible di&s;grace, of beginning its career, with the ruin of the country, which gave birth to the Philo&s;opher, to whom &s;he gratefully looks up, as to the author of her freedom: we will ble&s;s the hand, which re&s;cues the age of liberty, from the mortification and ignominy, of &s;eeing two free nations wantonly turning their arms again&s;t each other.</Q> See <HI>Recueit de Pieces authentiques pour &s;ervir de &s;uite &agrave; l'&eacute;crit intitul&eacute;, An accurate Statement of the Proceedings of the French towards the Republic of Geneva&mdash;London,</HI> 1739, <HI>Sold by Debrett, Piccadilly.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>But the plan of our invaders was now changed, and mea&s;ures, le&s;s violent, but more &s;ure, adopted; which have completely &s;ucceeded in de&s;troying the liberty and happine&s;s of Geneva. No &s;ooner did the Natives di&s;co|ver, from what pa&s;&s;ed in the Convention, as well as from
<PB N="13" REF="033927_0010_0FF9FAC1883735E0">other &s;ources of information, that the French had given up all thoughts of puni&s;hing the Magi&s;trates, or of taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town by force, and had, or affected to have, no other object than that of e&s;tabli&s;hing the right of <HI>univer&s;al &s;uffrage,</HI> and of procuring the admi&s;&s;ion of all the Geneve&s;e, without di&s;tinction, to the enjoyment of <HI>perfect political equality,</HI> than they began, in the mo&s;t open man|ner, to echo the language of the Convention, and to a&s;&s;ert their right to what it intended to give them. They al&s;o began, in imitation of the French, to addre&s;s each other by the title of <HI>Citizen,</HI> to wear the Red Cap, to &s;ing the favourite Pari&s;ian &s;ongs, and to make preparations for &s;upporting their claims by force. In the&s;e views, &s;ome of the Citizens &s;upported them; and either from motives of ambition, or from being them&s;elves the dupes of the fa&s;cinating &s;y&s;tem of what has been called <HI>the Rights of Man,</HI> put them&s;elves at their head. The &s;oldiers of the French army, who were &s;till encamped in the neighbour|hood, fanned the flames; and &s;ome of the officers actu|ally made &s;ecret offers of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Such, Sir, was the origin of that revolutionary delirium, the effect of which has been, gradually to introduce, among us, all the mi&s;eries of anarchy; and, in le&s;s than two years, has plunged our once-happy Republic into all the horrors, and all the crimes, which the fertile invention of Popular Tyranny can &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>The Magi&s;trates, alarmed at this new kind of danger, which &s;eemed to threaten, either the Con&s;titution, or the political independence of the State, or perhaps both, re|&s;olved to &s;ecure at lea&s;t the latter, and immediately pub|li&s;hed a propo&s;al to admit all the inhabitants of the Republic, whether aliens or natives, that is to &s;ay, de&s;cend|ants of aliens, into the General A&s;&s;embly, without di&s;|tinction, and without fine; and to take the opinion of the whole Body, thus con&s;tituted, on the propriety of further alterations. This propo&s;al, which was made by the Little and Great Councils, on the 1&s;t of December, only wanted the a&s;&s;ent of the General A&s;&s;embly it&s;elf (which it would undoubtedly have received) to have the force of law; but in the mean time, the enemies of our hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="14" REF="033927_0011_0FF9FAD6AD8073E8">took indefatigable pains, to repre&s;ent to the Natives, how humiliating it would be for them, to receive, as a favour, what was their natural and indefea&s;ible right, and which it was an additional in&s;ult to re&s;tore to them, by the forms of the very Con&s;titution, that had wre&s;ted it from them.</P>
<P>This doctrine &s;pread &s;o rapidly, and took &s;uch root in the minds of the Natives, that without waiting for the meeting of the A&s;&s;embly, which was fixed for the 6th of December, they ran to arms on the night of the 4th; and be&s;ides declaring them&s;elves entitled to the rights in que&s;tion, they in&s;i&s;ted that, in order to &s;ecure the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of them, every department of the State &s;hould be filled by individuals of their own party, and that a National Convention &s;hould be immediately &s;ummoned, for the purpo&s;e of introducing the new principles, into every part of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It is a certain fact, that this faction did not then amount to a fourth part of the inhabitants of Geneva; and our Magi&s;trates have, more than once, been &s;everely blamed, by tho&s;e who either do not know, or do not advert to all the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, for not immediately di&s;|per&s;ing it by force. The truth is, that nothing but the fear of the probable con&s;equences, prevented their doing &s;o: for, ever &s;ince the French had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sa|voy, we had been completely &s;urrounded by the territory of France; her troops, in direct violation, even of the la&s;t treaty, were &s;till at our gates: the decree of the Conven|tion, which ordered all the French Generals to relieve the people of every country from <HI>the tyranny of oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> had ju&s;t been received, and proclaimed, by the troops in our neighbourhood; the mo&s;t violent of the Natives openly avowed their intention to take advantage of that decree, if nece&s;&s;ary; and the French army only waited for the &s;lighte&s;t appearance of commotion, to enter the City, where it was &s;ure of finding many friends, and where, by its intrigues, it had in fact already e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ort of ad|vanced guard.</P>
<P>It was under the&s;e circum&s;tances, and in order to pre|&s;erve, it po&s;&s;ible, the political independence of their
<PB N="15" REF="033927_0011_0FF9FAD6AD8073E8">country, that the minority of the Geneve&s;e gave way to the minority. The members of the Little and Great Councils voluntarily re&s;igned their places to the chiefs of the new party, (mo&s;t of whom were among tho&s;e who left their po&s;ts at the approach of the French), and in re&s;igning them, required no other engagement from their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, than that they &s;hould maintain peace and good order, and pre|&s;erve the independence of the Republic.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French made no &s;ecret of the importance which they thought the acqui&s;ition of Geneva would be of to them; and when they &s;ub&s;ti|tuted the plan of intrigue for the former plan of force, <HI>Anachar&s;is Cloots,</HI> a principal character in the Convention, &s;aid publicly in his place, that <HI>if Geneva per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to give her&s;elf to France, they mu&s;t try to per&s;uade her to permit France to give her&s;elf to Geneva.</HI></NOTE> As this tran&s;|action, violent as it was, took place in a more quiet manner than the French army expected, it was di&s;appointed in its hopes of a tumult, which had been the immediate object of all its cabals, and which would have given it an opportunity of entering the town, and, under pretence of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the oppre&s;&s;ed, making us, in the end, a branch of their own Republic.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In order to take from the French every pretext for interfering any farther, the authors of the Revolution immediately announced the com|pletion of it, by planting the tree of liberty.

<P>In this manner, did the powerful Republic of France, in its very infancy, di&s;grace its arms, by turning them again&s;t the petty Democracy of Geneva; and, in this manner, when it &s;ub&s;tituted negociation for force, did it di&s;grace its diplomatic character, by expre&s;sly in&s;tructing its Mi|ni&s;ter, <HI>to exert his whole addre&s;s,</HI> and by openly violating two &s;olemn treaties, on the faith of which we had di&s;armed our&s;elves, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed our allies.

As a part of the dete&s;table plan, the French Re&s;ident waited immediately upon the new Magi&s;trates, and informed them, that he would lo&s;e no time in announcing to his Con&s;tituents <HI>the glorious event</HI> which had ju&s;t taken place; and, while he amu&s;ed them with profe&s;&s;ions of admiration and e&s;teem, General <HI>Kellerman</HI> &s;ecretly drew an additional body of troops round the town, in hopes of an opportunity of entering it.</P>
<P>The members of the new Government were now com|pletely in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the admini&s;tration; and notwith|&s;tanding the manner in which they had come into power, it is extremely probable that, like the party in France to whom they were indebted for it, they never would have engaged in &s;uch an undertaking, had they not been con|fident of being able to &s;top at whatever point they plea&s;ed, and to prevent their followers and adherents from going further than they wi&s;hed or meant them to go: for, it mu&s;t be allowed, that many of them were men of &s;ome property, and even of &s;ome education; and if we except a few acts of violence, done under the forms of ju&s;tice, and natu|rally to be expected at extraordinary periods, and &s;ome enormities of the populace, which, there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, were committed at the in&s;tigation of particular individuals in Admini&s;tration, they were in general active in their efforts to pre&s;erve the independence of their country, as well as its internal quiet.</P>
<P>It is equally true, however, that they had &s;everal con&s;ider|able ob&s;tacles to &s;truggle with. In the fir&s;t place, they had to encounter the decline of trade and manufactures, the con&s;equences of the ruin of &s;uch families as had inve&s;ted their property in the French funds, and the incredible con&s;umption of the public revenue, which was almo&s;t ex|hau&s;ted in &s;alaries to the 120 members of the Convention, and to the new Magi&s;trates, who&s;e needy circum&s;tances rendered a large allowance ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. In the next place, they had to oppo&s;e the intrigues and artifices of

But I have heard that &s;ince the &s;econd Revolution (which will be mentioned hereafter) the prohibition has been taken off.</NOTE> with a degree of freedom, which they never dared to a&s;&s;ume toward the other branches of the Helvetic Union, who, by &s;teadily adhering to their ancient Con&s;titutions, have never received, or expo&s;ed them&s;elves to receive, the &s;malle&s;t mark of di&s;re&s;pect. Be&s;ides this, they had to fight again&s;t a new faction, formed out of the refu&s;e of their own, and divided into two clubs, called the <HI>Mar&s;eille&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Mountaineers.</HI> The&s;e clubs were not very numerous; but they were notoriou&s;ly under the influence and direction of the French Re&s;ident; both profe&s;&s;ed the new doctrines to their utmo&s;t extent, and both (but particularly the latter) &s;eemed prepared to imitate the conduct of tho&s;e who had carried them the farthe&s;t in France, and even to &s;urrender them&s;elves and their country into their hands.</P>
<P>So &s;trongly, however, was the great body of the Gene|ve&s;e attached to the idea of national independence, and &s;o grateful did they feel, even to the new admini&s;tration, for its efforts to maintain it, that they forgave the manner in which it had come into power, and overlooked both the faults it had already committed, and tho&s;e into which its incapacity, the violence of party, or the peculiar difficul|ties of its &s;ituation, daily and hourly led it. On more than one occa&s;ion, the very Magi&s;trates who&s;e offices they had u&s;urped, came forward to a&s;&s;i&s;t and guide them; and
<PB N="18" REF="033927_0013_0FF9FAFB05770C40">&s;ome of them were even prevailed upon, to become mem|bers of the new Convention, which met on the 25th of February, 1793, and was compo&s;ed of 120 members. If &s;at for about a year, and unfortunately, like that in Paris, &s;oon fell under the controul of a Club, which had borrowed both its principles and its language from the Jacobins, to whom it had applied for a copy of their rules, and forms, and who&s;e importance it affected to a&s;&s;ume, on all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>During the &s;itting of the Convention, the friends of the old Con&s;titution experienced, from the rabble of Revolu|tioni&s;ts, every &s;pecies of indignity, and in&s;ult, which the capricious malice of men without education, and without property, could invent. Tho&s;e pretended reformers pa|raded the &s;treets, in the evening, with cudgels in their hands, and attacked, and &s;everely beat, &s;uch as they thought aver&s;e to their &s;y&s;tem: nor did the Government take any effectual &s;teps, to prevent the&s;e exce&s;&s;es, which were continued, for a con&s;iderable time, and were never puni&s;hed, though the country hou&s;e of an Ex-Magi&s;trate, who had been Commander in Chief during the late inva|&s;ion, was pillaged for &s;everal days, and another per&s;on a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in open day-light, becau&s;e he had worn a white cap, in&s;tead of a red one. It is unnece&s;&s;ary, and would be tedious, to enumerate all the mean cruelties which the di&s;ciples of the new &s;chool of Equality prac|ti&s;ed: it is enough to &s;ay, that a de&s;cription of them would pre&s;ent a picture of Popular tyranny, as provoking by its in&s;olence, as the &s;cenes which &s;ucceeded them were &s;hocking, by their barbarity.</P>
<P>Though the Convention affected to pre&s;erve &s;ome of the forms of the old Con&s;titution, yet, in order to de&s;erve the pompous name it had a&s;&s;umed, it thought it&s;elf bound to make a complete, and radical change in its principles; and in treating the petty abu&s;es of a &s;mall Republic, to act as if they had been called upon to correct the invete|rate corruptions, and deep-rooted errors of an ancient and exten&s;ive Monarchy. <HI>De&s;poti&s;m,</HI> &s;aid one of the leading members of it, <HI>is a fiery meteor, which &s;corches the &s;oil over which it pa&s;&s;es.</HI> Even &s;uch bomba&s;t as this had
<PB N="19" REF="033927_0013_0FF9FAFB05770C40">its effect upon the di&s;tempered minds of tho&s;e to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed, and was received with univer&s;al applau&s;e.</P>
<P>In order to ingratiate them&s;elves with the French, one of their fir&s;t &s;teps was to aboli&s;h the Great Council, and to tran&s;|fer a portion of the power of the Little Council to the Gene|ral A&s;&s;embly, by which means they de&s;troyed the equili|brium between the executive and legi&s;lative branches, which the ancient Con&s;titution had provided with &s;o much care: but, on the other hand, it mu&s;t be acknowledged that, in the laws they framed, they &s;hewed great regard to per&s;onal &s;ecurity, and even e&s;tabli&s;hed the Trial by Jury. Perhaps, it would have been well to enquire, whether that noble in&s;titution (which one of the greate&s;t nations of Europe con&s;iders as the mo&s;t &s;acred of all its rights, and its be&s;t &s;ecurity for the enjoyment of the re&s;t) is equally &s;uited to &s;o &s;mall a State, as Geneva, where it is &s;o diffi|cult to prevent the influence of per&s;onal feelings, and pri|vate con&s;iderations: but the introduction of it &s;hewed, at lea&s;t, the goodne&s;s of their intentions.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be imagined, however, that a Demo|cracy, &s;o unlimited as this, was approved by the greater part of tho&s;e who &s;ubmitted to it. The People at large had not forgot the &s;ound principles in which they had been educated; they knew perfectly well, that &s;ome degree of re&s;traint is e&s;&s;ential to the very exi&s;tence of liberty, and were extremely attached to the balances of the Old Con&s;titution; con&s;equently every artifice was practi&s;ed, that could &s;ecure the ratification of the New, by the General A&s;&s;embly. The authors of it affected to a&s;&s;ume the tone of friend&s;hip and confidence, towards tho&s;e who, they knew, di&s;approved of it, and intreated them to give it their &s;upport, if not from conviction of its goodne&s;s, at lea&s;t, to defeat the &s;chemes of both the foreign, and the dome&s;tic enemies of the public peace, who, if it was rejected, would not fail to convert its want of &s;ucce&s;s into an opportunity of creating general confu&s;ion; but more particularly for the purpo&s;e of di&s;ap|pointing the inferior agents of the Revolution, who began to &s;hew a &s;pirit of in&s;ubordination and turbulence, incom|patible with any &s;ocial order whatever, and only to be
<PB N="20" REF="033927_0014_0FF9FB1017B18570">repelled, by the appearance of union, and general &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the new &s;y&s;tem. They a&s;&s;ured them, that it would amply provide for the &s;ecurity both of the per&s;ons and of the property of tho&s;e who were to live under it, which, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of the Republic, was of more importance than the pre&s;ervation of any particular &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>This language was &s;o &s;pecious, and was accompanied by promi&s;es, apparently &s;o &s;incere, that they to whom it was ad|dre&s;&s;ed, though they &s;till adhered to their principles, with|drew their oppo&s;ition; and, for the &s;ake of peace, or perhaps as choo&s;ing the lea&s;t of two evils, agreed to &s;up|port the new Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It was accordingly propo&s;ed, and adopted, in a Gene|ral A&s;&s;embly on the 5th of February 1794, by 4,200 voices again&s;t 200; and as a farther proof of the conci|liatory di&s;po&s;ition, and amicable intentions of tho&s;e who &s;upported it, the new offices were entirely filled up with its avowed friends. Nor was this all; for as the war, in which almo&s;t the whole of Europe was involved, had con&s;iderably affected the Watch-making bu&s;ine&s;s, which is the principal &s;upport of the poor in Geneva; and as the &s;tagnation of trade, as well as the habits of indolence, into which a great many of the workmen had been thrown by the Revolution, had reduced the lower cla&s;&s;es of the People to con&s;iderable di&s;tre&s;s, very general &s;ub&s;criptions were made by all tho&s;e in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, to keep them in employment until the market &s;hould be again open.</P>
<P>By &s;uch generous and di&s;intere&s;ted conduct, the Repub|lic &s;eemed likely to weather the &s;torm, which had wrecked her more powerful neighbour. The Swi&s;s, who, for eighteen months pa&s;t, had renounced every kind of official communication with us, thought they &s;aw what the hi&s;tory of the world had produced no other in&s;tance of, the Go|vernment of a Country &s;uddenly and completely di&s;&s;olved, and Anarchy not the con&s;equence. A&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch a phaenomenon, they yielded to the repeated and earne&s;t &s;olicitations of &s;ome of the depo&s;ed Magi&s;trates, and con&s;ented to corre&s;pond with their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who now
<PB N="21" REF="033927_0014_0FF9FB1017B18570">a&s;&s;umed the title of <HI>Con&s;titutional Government.</HI> In &s;hort, the new Admini&s;tration &s;eemed to gain &s;trength every day, and to be better qualified for the di&s;|charge of their functions: even tho&s;e who di&s;approved of the manner in which they had come into power, were ready to &s;upport them again&s;t every attack. The greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who had abandoned Ge|neva, for fear of the exce&s;&s;es, into which, it was natu|ral to expect, that men unaccu&s;tomed to authority would run, gradually returned to it, and implicitly tru&s;ted to the a&s;&s;urances they received, that the Revolution <HI>was completed,</HI> and that they might depend on finding, under its protection, &s;afety for their per&s;ons, and &s;ecurity for their property.</P>
<P>But, alas! the whole was a delu&s;ion; and in an in&s;tant, the malignant genius of France again bla&s;ted all our hopes.</P>
<P>An advocate of the name of <HI>Bou&s;quet,</HI> who had taken an active part in the u&s;urpation of 1792, and been elected a Magi&s;trate, was &s;oon afterwards &s;ent in a public charac|ter to Paris. During his &s;tay there, he imbibed from the leaders of the Jacobins (to whom his mi&s;&s;ion gave him con&s;tant acce&s;s) all the poi&s;on of their principles, and re|turned, after a year's ab&s;ence, to Geneva, full of theories of &s;edition and revolution, and impatient to put them in prac|tice. With this view, he immediately joined the Mar&s;eil|le&s;e and the Mountaineers, whom he found perfectly di&s;|ciplined, and prepared for any enterpri&s;e, by the indu&s;try of <HI>Soulavie.</HI> He immediately opened his plan, which con&s;i&s;ted of five principal objects. Fir&s;t, to wean the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people from the confidence they placed in &s;uch Members of the new Government, as had any character for integrity, by accu&s;ing them of being &s;ecretly leagued with the Rich, or at lea&s;t of &s;avouring and &s;creen|ing them: Secondly, to &s;trip his colleagues, and even the General A&s;&s;embly it&s;elf, of their authority, and to transfer all their powers to a few of his own parti&s;ans, under the title of <HI>Revolutionary Government;</HI> Thirdly, to erect a Revolutionary Tribunal, which would &s;oon rid him of all tho&s;e from whom he had any thing to fear; and by the re&s;entment which the effu&s;ion of blood, as well as the
<PB N="22" REF="033927_0015_0FF9FB2708A159C0">lo&s;s of their property, would naturally occa&s;ion in the bo&s;oms of the injured, make the retreat of his parti&s;ans impo&s;&s;ible: Fourthly, to adopt the French &s;y&s;tem of making <HI>Terror the order of the day,</HI> &s;o as to carry it into every cla&s;s and de&s;cription of men, and make the &s;maller number ma&s;ters of the greater: La&s;tly, to hold up the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed religion as an object of ridicule and contempt.</P>
<P>The material parts of this plan, exten&s;ive and difficult as it &s;eems, were executed in a &s;ingle night. Indeed the author of it had no time to lo&s;e, as it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be carried into execution, before a propo&s;al, then in contemplation, for laying another a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment on the people of property, could be made. For, as there was no doubt that the propo&s;al would be received without oppo&s;ition, the &s;ucce&s;s of it would pre|vent any clamour being rai&s;ed again&s;t that de&s;cription of men, and, at the &s;ame time, re&s;tore to the Admini&s;tration, &s;ome part of the vigour which it had lo&s;t, by its improvi|dent management of the public finances.</P>
<P>This, therefore, was the critical moment; and <HI>Bou&s;quet</HI> began the execution of his plan, by &s;preading reports of con&s;piracies to effect a counter-revolution, and to re|peat at <HI>Geneva,</HI> the horrors which had been committed in <HI>la Vend&eacute;e;</HI> and by taking every opportunity of declaring publicly, that, even though the Rich could be brought to con&s;ent to the propo&s;ed a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, (which he &s;trongly in&s;inuated they would not) yet, in his opinion, there were means of relieving the mi&s;eries of the People, much more effectual, than that of exempting them from the payment of taxes. "The Rich," he &s;aid, <Q>had too long wa&s;ted, in their own &s;elfi&s;h plea&s;ures, that which ought to be applied to the maintenance, and comfort of the Poor; too long had they been &s;uffered to in&s;ult them by their wanton extravagance, and even by the wretched pit|tances of alms which they affectedly di&s;tributed. The de&s;truction of the pernicious &s;pirit of Ari&s;tocracy, which had pervaded the Laws and Con&s;titution, would an&s;wer no purpo&s;e, and would but palliate the evil, if it was &s;uffered &s;till to influence the conduct and the &s;entiments
<PB N="23" REF="033927_0015_0FF9FB2708A159C0">of the Rich: nor would any thing &s;hort of complete eradication an&s;wer any u&s;eful purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>The minds of the multitude being thus prepared, the night of the 18th of July 1794 (being the eve of the day on which the new a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments were to be propo&s;ed) was cho|&s;en for the execution of the plot. The whole plan was laid, all the parts were a&s;&s;igned, every agent was at his &s;tation, and the victims marked out: in the mid&s;t of the night, the Con&s;pirators ran to arms, &s;eized the artillery of the Town, and entered, by means of fal&s;e keys, into the hou&s;es of &s;uch of the Citizens, as, they apprehended, might be inclined to oppo&s;e force to force, and di&s;armed them before they knew what was intended again&s;t them. To di&s;gui&s;e their intentions the more completely, they put two of the new Syndics under arre&s;t, who have &s;ince been anxious to have it believed, that the blow was &s;o &s;udden as well as violent, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for Go|vernment to ward it off, which it would not have failed to do, had it been aware of it in time. But there are not wanting men of very good information, and of unque&s;|tionable veracity, who a&s;&s;ert, in the mo&s;t unqualified man|ner, that the Magi&s;trates were well acquainted with what was to happen, and wanted neither courage nor &s;trength to prevent it, had they been de&s;irous of it; but that, in fact, the detention of the two <HI>Syndics</HI> (which la&s;ted but a few hours) was a farce, contrived between them and <HI>Bou&s;|quet;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Indeed the two Syndics in que&s;tion were actually &s;een, on the night of the 18th, in the foremo&s;t ranks of the con&s;pirators, with arms in their hands.</NOTE> and though they had not taken a direct and active part in the execution of the plot, they were &s;till to be con|&s;idered as accomplices in it; and, be&s;ides other rea&s;ons, knew that its &s;ucce&s;s would relieve them, from the di&s;a|greeable nece&s;&s;ity of giving in their accounts, and expo&s;ing the &s;hamele&s;s manner, in which they had wa&s;ted the pub|lic trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>However this may be, it is certain that Government took no &s;tep to defeat the plot, or even to prevent the &s;hocking lengths to which it was carried. From the nature of the attack, one would have &s;uppo&s;ed that the city had been &s;tormed by a foreign Enemy; but the &s;y&s;|tematic
<PB N="24" REF="033927_0016_0FF9FB3AAA54AF68">regularity with which it was conducted, together with the perfect knowledge the plunderers &s;hewed, of the places in which the objects of their pillage were depo&s;ited, &s;oon convinced the unhappy &s;ufferers that their Enemies lived within the &s;ame walls, and, in many in&s;tances, under the &s;ame roof with them&s;elves. The Con&s;pirators were divided into &s;mall bodies well armed, did not affect to pro|duce the authority by which they acted, left &s;eals on what was too heavy to be carried off, and took care to include &s;ome of the poorer, and more ob&s;cure Citizens, among tho&s;e whom they put into confinement. But with &s;o little regard to humanity were the&s;e <HI>domiciliary vi&s;its</HI> con|ducted, that though the heat of the weather was exce&s;&s;ive, the pri&s;ons were crowded with the aged, the infirm, the di&s;ea&s;ed; and even with &s;ome who were torn from their beds in the height of malignant fevers. This work of horror was executed in a few hours, by not more than a hundred wretches, one half of whom were foreigners; but it had the effect which <HI>Bou&s;quet</HI> expected, and he was joined the next day, by the re&s;t of the populace, by every man of unfixed principles or of de&s;perate fortune, and by not a few of an oppo&s;ite de&s;cription, who vainly hoped, that by appearing to countenance what had been done, they might acquire an influence over the perpetrators, &s;ufficient to prevent the execution of what was &s;till intended.</P>
<P><HI>Bou&s;quet</HI> now collected all his a&s;&s;ociates together, and addre&s;&s;ing them by the title of <HI>Revolutionary Nation,</HI> pro|po&s;ed, that a daily allowance &s;hould be paid to tho&s;e patriots, who &s;hould per&s;evere in the great work they had undertaken. He ob&s;erved, that it was only by deter|mined and vigorous mea&s;ures, both at home and abroad, that the <HI>French</HI> had &s;ecured &s;uch brilliant &s;ucce&s;s, in their glorious &s;truggles again&s;t De&s;poti&s;m; that the&s;e mea&s;ures, &s;evere as they might appear, were as ea&s;ily to be reconciled to pure morality, as to &s;ound policy; and, both in their principle and in their effects, ju&s;tified tho&s;e, with which, he &s;hould propo&s;e to begin the reign of liberty, and virtue in <HI>Geneva.</HI> The Con&s;titutional Government was then formally &s;u&s;pended, and the whole Executive and Legi&s;|lative power of the State, committed to a <HI>provi&s;ional Re|volutionary Tribunal,</HI> of which <HI>Bou&s;quet</HI> was of cour&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="033927_0016_0FF9FB3AAA54AF68">made Pre&s;ident. The number of per&s;ons who were taken into cu&s;tody, increa&s;ed every hour, and by the indu&s;try of Soulavie, who had given orders in all the neighbouring French di&s;tricts, that &s;uch of the inhabitants of Geneva as retired to any of them &s;hould be obliged to return, it &s;oon amounted to near 600 per&s;ons; among whom were mo&s;t of the Magi&s;trates who had been depo&s;ed from their offices in 1792, many of the Profe&s;&s;ors, and almo&s;t the whole of the Clergy, a body of men who did honour to their coun|try and to human nature, by their talents, their know|ledge, their mild and tolerant &s;pirit, and the &s;potle&s;s purity of their lives. Le&s;t any of the latter &s;hould e&s;cape, they were pur&s;ued even into the churches, which, in &s;pite of the threats they heard on all &s;ides, of being treated as the prie&s;ts had been treated in Paris, on the 2d of Septem|ber, tho&s;e venerable men had entered, for the purpo&s;e of imploring the mercy of Heaven upon their di&s;tracted coun|try. In this manner, was the horrible &s;entence formerly pronounced by Bri&s;&s;ot, &s;ulfilled to its utmo&s;t extent: <HI>There mu&s;t be a Revolution in Geneva, or there will be a Counter-Revolution in France.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the mid&s;t however of the&s;e &s;hocking &s;cenes, &s;ome few circum&s;tances &s;hewed, that the native character of the Geneve&s;e was not to be depraved but by degrees. Some of the Revolutioni&s;ts could not refrain from tears, when they were ordered to be the gaolers of their countrymen, and, in more than one in&s;tance, declared, that <HI>they envied their &s;ituation, and, if po&s;&s;ible, would gladly exchange with them.</HI> But the&s;e, as well as many other expre&s;&s;ions of regret and remor&s;e, were of little avail to the unhappy victims, who&s;e adver&s;aries were too watchful to leave them any means either of e&s;cape or re&s;i&s;tance. One gene|rous effort, indeed, was made by the women of Geneva (for the experiment was too hazardous for men to en|gage in), who, to the number of two thou&s;and, went in a body to the Revolutionary Tribunal, to intercede for them; but their tears and entreaties had no other effect, than that of expo&s;ing them to the brutal ridicule of the Judges, who ordered the fire-engines to be got ready, in

<P>This feeble ob&s;tacle being removed, the Tribunal eagerly entered upon the di&s;charge of its functions, and ordered eight of the pri&s;oners to be brought up to trial, in which number, expre&s;s directions were given to include the Ex-&s;yndic <HI>Cayla,</HI> who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by the intrepid &s;pirit with which he had oppo&s;ed the former Revolution, the Ex-coun&s;ellor <HI>Prevo&s;t,</HI> who&s;e principal offence was, that he had taken part in the negociation with General Monte&s;quiou, and the Advocate <HI>De Roche|mont.</HI></P>

<P>When this circum&s;tance was known, the Mar&s;eille&s;e and Mountaineers, impatient for blood, &s;urrounded the Tribunal, with threats of vengeance again&s;t the perfidious Judges, who had acted &s;o incon&s;i&s;tently with their former profe&s;&s;ions, and propo&s;ed to make an immediate ma&s;&s;acre
<PB N="27" REF="033927_0017_0FF9FB52A4C24358">of all the pri&s;oners. The Judges affected to be alarmed, and the next day returned to the Bench, and, amid&s;t the clamours and howlings of the Galleries, gave their opinions, not by ballot, as before, but openly; the con&s;equence of which was, that &s;even of the eight were condemned to die, by the very men who, but the day before, had acquirted &s;ix of them; and who, on both occa&s;ions, called the Al|mighty to witne&s;s the purity with which they gave their &s;entence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Revolutionary Nation</HI> to whom an appeal was re|&s;erved, immediately a&s;&s;embled, in arms, to con&s;ider the &s;entence of the &s;even per&s;ons condemned; and though, under pretence of purifying the A&s;&s;embly, the leaders of the Revolution had carefully excluded from it, all whom they &s;u&s;pected, either of integrity, or humanity, there was &s;till a decided majority for &s;paring the lives of <HI>Cayla, Pre|vo&s;t,</HI> and <HI>de Rochemont.</HI></P>
<P>This third deci&s;ion, &s;o different from what they expected, increa&s;ed the rage of the brutal Jani&s;aries of the Revo|lution.

Nor was this all: they &s;ent armed Deputies to the Tribunal, to complain that fal&s;e patriots had artfully mixed them&s;elves, on this occa&s;ion, with the real lovers of their country, and di&s;|appointed their hopes; to in&s;i&s;t that the &s;entence of the three Ari&s;tocrats, who had been acquitted, &s;hould be annulled, and to declare, that, if this reque&s;t was refu&s;ed or delayed, they would repair to the pri&s;on, and do them|&s;elves ju&s;tice.</P>

<HEAD>TO OUR DEAR AND FAITHFUL FELLOW-CITIZENS, WE, THE AVOYER, LITTLE COUNCIL, AND GREAT COUNCIL, OF THE CITY AND REPUBLIC OF BERNE, SEND GREETING.</HEAD>
<P>You cannot be ignorant of the melancholy events, which have lately taken place in <HI>Geneva.</HI> That Repub|lic,
<PB N="31" REF="033927_0019_0FF9FB79F5872FA0">in who&s;e welfare, both as allies, and as neighbours, we have taken &s;o long the &s;tronge&s;t, and mo&s;t affectionate intere&s;t, is overwhelmed by calamities, perfectly new in their kind, and in extent, duration, and con&s;equences, beyond the eye of Man to trace.</P>
<P>At the very moment when We, and our Neighbours, the Canton of <HI>Zurich,</HI> were told in form by the new Government of <HI>Geneva,</HI> that the Revolution was com|pleted; that peace and tranquillity would be the imme|diate con&s;equence of the new Sy&s;tem, and that all former differences were at an end; We learn that a band of lawle&s;s Men has attacked, and, by main force, com|pletely overthrown, in that Republic, all public Li|berty, and all private &s;ecurity. Hou&s;es have been forcibly entered, without lawful authority; the Inha|bitants of them, violently dragged out of them, arbi|tratily detained, and illegally impri&s;oned. The Mini&s;|ters of Religion have been attacked in a City, which called it&s;elf one of the <HI>bulwarks of the Reformation,</HI> in a manner, that threatens Religion it&s;elf.&mdash;In the mid&s;t of this general confu&s;ion, &s;ome individuals have been put to death, again&s;t the wi&s;hes of a decided Majority of their Judges. Plots are laid again&s;t the lives, the liber|ty, and the property of others, without regard to the &s;anctity of oaths, or the e&s;tabli&s;hed forms and &s;etled maxims of Law; and the Inhabitants in general are at the mercy of U&s;urpers, who di&s;po&s;e of the lives and fortunes of their Countrymen, with no other rule of conduct, than their own tyrannical caprice.</P>
<P>We &s;ee with the livelie&s;t &s;orrow, the wretched &s;itu|ation of a State, which has ever been an object of inte|re&s;t to us, and from its local po&s;ition, mu&s;t ever engage the attention of the Helvetic Body. But our &s;orrow is lo&s;t in indignation, when We hear, that &s;ome of our own &s;ubjects have taken a part in tran&s;actions &s;o cri|minal. Our anxiety for the &s;afety, and honour of our country, will not permit us to &s;uffer &s;uch men to return to, or remain in it. We therefore order, that &s;uch of them as are not at pre&s;ent within our territories, do not pre&s;ume to enter them; and that tho&s;e who have engaged
<PB N="32" REF="033927_0020_0FF9FB8F608AD368">in &s;uch enormities, and are within our juri&s;diction, be immediately apprehended, in order to receive the pu|ni&s;hment their crimes de&s;erve.</P>
<P>We have no doubt but that our Dear and Faithful Fellow-citizens will participate the&s;e &s;entiments with us, and will exert them&s;elves, to give effect to this Procla|mation. Above all, We indulge a confident hope, that the &s;ight of the di&s;a&s;ters which have overwhelmed <HI>Geneva</HI> will teach them to &s;et a ju&s;t value on tho&s;e impartial laws, which, with a mild and beneficent Religion, have &s;o long &s;ecured to us the enjoyment of public peace, of private &s;ecurity, and of all the ble&s;&s;ings which Almighty God &s;o liberally be&s;tows on tho&s;e He loves, and which, We tru&s;t, He will continue to &s;hed on us, as He &s;hed them on our forefathers, if, like them, We confide in his goodne&s;s, and endeavour to de&s;erve the continuance of it, by our obedience to his Laws, and our un&s;haken love of our Country.</P>

<P>This truly paternal admonition had the effect it de&s;erved, on that part of the territory of <HI>Berne,</HI> which lies the neare&s;t to us; for tho&s;e of the inhabitants, on whom the artifices which had &s;ucceeded &s;o fatally in <HI>Geneva,</HI> had been prac|ti&s;ed with &s;ome degree of effect, have &s;ince candidly acknow|ledged, that the fate of the <HI>Geneve&s;e</HI> brought them back to a &s;en&s;e of their intere&s;t, and duty.</P>
<P>In the mean time, under pretence of <HI>Economy,</HI> but in truth, to conceal the extent of the horrors that had been, and &s;till were to be perpetrated; the <HI>Revolutionary Tribu|nal</HI> i&s;&s;ued an order forbidding the u&s;e of mourning, for a year to come. This was &s;oon followed by another, for lowering the intere&s;t of money, and for annulling all lea&s;es; by the la&s;t of which regulations, they not only relieved the lower cla&s;&s;es, from the payment of rents, which, from the depreciated value of property, were become too high, but in fact levied a heavy fine upon tho&s;e people of pro|perty,
<PB N="33" REF="033927_0020_0FF9FB8F608AD368">whom they had hitherto had no pretence for at|tacking.</P>
<P>They al&s;o renewed their <HI>domiciliary vi&s;its,</HI> leaving no more than twelve ounces of plate to any individual; and becau&s;e the <HI>French</HI> had con&s;i&s;cated the property of &s;uch of their own Emigrants, as had borne arms again&s;t the new Republic, the&s;e faithful imitators &s;ummoned mo&s;t of the <HI>Geneve&s;e</HI> who happened to be ab&s;ent, when the late tragic &s;cenes were acted, to return immediately, under the &s;ame penalty, and ordered all per&s;ons who&s;e fortunes exceeded 800 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling, to give in an account of them within a week, in order that they might be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in proportion to their property and to their patrioti&s;m: and, to crown the whole, they a&s;&s;igned &s;everal churches as places of meeting for the different Clubs; they reduced the u&s;ual divine Service to a very &s;mall number of Offices, and permitted the ceremony of Marriage, and the admini&s;tration of the Sacrament of Bapti&s;m, to be performed by the civil Ma|gi&s;trate.</P>
<P>The <HI>Revolutionary Tribunal</HI> having thus prepared the way for new enterpri&s;es, and made a &s;atisfactory trial of the obedience of its &s;ubjects, by threatening all, who pre|&s;umed to expre&s;s the &s;lighte&s;t di&s;approbation of its mea|&s;ures, with what it called a <HI>Revolutionary puni&s;hment,</HI> re|&s;umed the proceedings, which it had &s;u&s;pended only until it could &s;atisfy it&s;elf, whether the Nation was &s;uffi|ciently accu&s;tomed to the &s;ight of blood, to bear the further effu&s;ion of it. After bani&s;hing &s;ome &s;oldiers of the Garri&s;on, who had generou&s;ly refu&s;ed to act as execu|tioners on the late occa&s;ion, it &s;elected four other victims; three of whom had been Magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>One of them, named <HI>Naville Gallatin,</HI> was a man of great talents, and defended him&s;elf with &s;uch eloquence and &s;trength of argument, that one of his Judges, in giving &s;entence again&s;t him, &s;aid,&mdash;<HI>I have two con&s;ciences; one of which tells me You are innocent; but the other tells me, You mu&s;t die, that the State may be &s;aved.&mdash;When I die,</HI> an&s;wered the intrepid Magi&s;trate, <HI>the State will lo&s;e a great Citizen.</HI>

I &s;ee none on that Bench, but U&s;urpers.&mdash;After the de&s;truction of the legal Ma|gi&s;tracy in 1792, You made new Laws, and erected new Authorities; both of which You have &s;ince &s;uper&s;eded, and, in their &s;tead, have e&s;tabli&s;hed a mercile&s;s Pro&s;cription.... Will you dare to &s;ay, that you act under the Authority of the Sovereign People?

<P><Q>Do not imagine that I mean to di&s;grace my&s;elf, by endeavour|ing to excite your compa&s;&s;ion.

In breach, however of the promi&s;e, they contrived that the execu|tioners &s;hould come and demand him; and he, in the middle of the night, was &s;hot, with the ex-&s;yndic <HI>Fatio,</HI> on a remote part of the Ramparts.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The two others, <HI>Andeoud</HI> and <HI>Delorme,</HI> were executed at nearly the &s;ame time; &s;o that, in the whole, eleven per&s;ons &s;uffered on this occa&s;ion, viz. <HI>Cayla, Prevo&s;t, De Rochement, De Combe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">, Vivien, Chenaud, Meu|nier, Naville, Fatio, Audeoud, and Delorme.</HI></NOTE></P>

When language like this, is heard from &s;uch men, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; when to other crimes, is added the hy|pocritical affection of con&s;cience and principle, what hope is there of remor&s;e? What expectation of a return to ju&s;|tice and humanity? Alas! the unfortunate <HI>Geneve&s;e</HI> have no hope, no expectation, but that feeble one, that the fate of <HI>Rober&s;pierre</HI> may be a warning to his imitators, and that, &s;ince compunction cannot, fear may produce &s;ome mitigation of their cruelty.</P>
<P>But however this may be, <HI>Geneva</HI> is no longer what it was, a very few months ago: it is a new city &s;tanding on the ruins of the old one; in&s;tead of peace, &s;ecurity, indu&s;|try, content, and all the hapine&s;s which attends the prac|tice of virtue, nothing is to be &s;een but pillage, murder, and all the crimes, and all the mi&s;ery, which the di&s;&s;olution of &s;ocial ties, lets it upon the human &s;pecies. Such is the train of evils, which the adoption of the <HI>Jacobinical</HI> philo|&s;ophy, has introduced into <HI>Geneva:</HI> what mu&s;t the effects of that Sy&s;tem be, upon other countries, when we &s;ee tho&s;e it has produced upon a nation, which, in the mid&s;t of its former inte&s;tine commotions, con&s;tantly revered the rights of property, and &s;huddered at the &s;ight of blood!</P>
<P>That a people &s;o wi&s;e, &s;o temperate, &s;o much accu&s;|tomed to Liberty, and &s;o well acquainted with the convul|&s;ions which the enjoyment of it too often occa&s;ions, &s;hould &s;o &s;uddenly have abandoned its native character and a&s;&s;u|med a new one, cannot but be matter of &s;urpri&s;e to every attentive reader, and certainly calls for &s;ome explanation. The limits of a letter do not permit me to go into a long detail, though the &s;ubject is worthy of the minute&s;t inve&s;ti|gation. I &s;hall therefore briefly &s;tate, that I do not he&s;itate to impute the whole of that &s;trange depravation of the cha|racter of my Countrymen, to the effect of a combination borrowed by them of the <HI>French,</HI> from whence <HI>La Fayette,</HI> too late, and in vain, predicted that anarchy and di&s;order which has &s;ince &s;o univer&s;ally prevailed in every depart|ment of his Country: I mean that combination, which, by gradually imparting power to tho&s;e who were not re&s;pon|&s;ible for the u&s;e of it, at la&s;t left tho&s;e re&s;pon&s;ible for the
<PB N="38" REF="033927_0023_0FF9FBCCF68A3FF0">u&s;e of it, from who&s;e hands it had been wre&s;ted.&mdash;As the attention of your Countrymen will, no doubt, be much engaged in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the probable con&s;equences of the new <HI>&s;elf-created popular &s;ocieties, or Clubs,</HI> and particularly the dangers re&s;ulting from any <HI>a&s;&s;ociation</HI> among&s;t them, I &s;hall be more particular in explaining my meaning.</P>
<P>Cicero a&s;cribes the duration of the Republican form of Government in Rome, to the in&s;titution of the office of <HI>Tribune;</HI> the very office which &s;eems &s;o often to have en|dangered the exi&s;tence of the Government, but which, though e&s;tabli&s;hed for the purpo&s;e of re&s;i&s;ting the u&s;urpa|tions of the Senate, in its operation effectually re&s;trained the extravagancies of the people, by making the Plebeian Magi&s;trates re&s;pon&s;ible for them.&mdash;The hi&s;tory of Geneva abounds with illu&s;trations of the truth of Cicero's ob&s;er|vation. During the &s;truggle of Parties, which &s;o fre|quently di&s;tracted that little Republic, we con&s;tantly &s;ee that the rights of property and of per&s;ons, were pre&s;erved with religious care, and that the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ocial order, were equally the objects of reverence with both. This can be a&s;cribed to no other cau&s;e than the union of power and re&s;pon&s;ibility in tho&s;e who were appointed the Chiefs of both Parties, and remained &s;o during the whole conte&s;t. Even the moderation which was ob&s;erved for the fir&s;t &s;ix months after the Revolution, or rather U&s;urpation of 1792, is to be referred to no other cau&s;e. But from that period, when the inferior Demagogues, who were of too little con&s;equence to be members of either the Government or the Convention, began, in imitation of the Jacobins at Paris, to collect all their Democratical Clubs, and unite them into one great <HI>Central Club,</HI> under the direction of a weekly Pre&s;ident, the whole fabric of Government and of &s;ocial order was &s;haken to its ba&s;e, becau&s;e the whole power of the State thereby fell into the hands of a capri|cious mob, which either had no chiefs at all, or had &s;uch as were not permanent, and con&s;equently not &s;ubject to the &s;malle&s;t degree of re&s;pon&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The new Magi&s;trates had undoubtedly no &s;u&s;picion of the &s;hock, which the erection of this great <HI>Central Club,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="033927_0023_0FF9FBCCF68A3FF0">would finally give to their authority; nor were they &s;en&s;ible of it, until the General A&s;&s;embly, which, under the old Con|&s;titution of Geneva, &s;eldom met, and had merely a power of adopting or rejecting, by a &s;imple affirmative or nega|tive, the new Laws propo&s;ed to it, was &s;uper&s;eded by another Body partially con&s;tituted, daily a&s;&s;embled, and a&s;&s;uming the power of deliberating and propo&s;ing new mea&s;ures, as well as of cen&s;uring tho&s;e adopted by Admi|ni&s;tration. The re&s;olves of this new Body &s;oon became orders which the Government did not dare to di&s;obey, and for which neverthele&s;s, it was &s;till con&s;idered as re&s;pon&s;ible, though the individuals at who&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions tho&s;e re&s;olves had been taken were never inquired after.&mdash;When the Magi&s;trates di&s;covered the in&s;ignificancy to which they were thus reduced, they tried to re&s;tore them&s;elves to &s;ome &s;hare of their former importance, by endeavouring to put them&s;elves at the head of the <HI>Central</HI> Club, which was now in fact the head of the Republic: But it was now too late; the chief power and influence of that Body was in a continual &s;tate of fluctuation, and the public mind &s;o entirely alienated and perverted, that they had no means of obtaining even a hearing, but by declaiming again&s;t the moderation of the Government, or of the Convention. From invectives of this &s;ort, they &s;oon proceeded to pro|po&s;als of the mo&s;t extravagant nature; they openly circu|lated alarming reports of the machinations of the Ari&s;to|cratical party, and recommended alterations, which, they &s;aid, would not fail to re&s;tore the Golden Age.</P>
<P>The con&s;equences of thus intermixing the de&s;poti&s;m of the rabble, with the dominion of the people, were &s;uch as might naturally be expected: habits of indolence, the di&s;tre&s;s occa&s;ioned by tho&s;e habits, a &s;ort of perpetual in|toxication of the public mind, and the mo&s;t alarming in&s;tability both of political and moral principle.&mdash;The&s;e mi&s;chie&s;s were the more exten&s;ive, as, for the fir&s;t time in Geneva, young men under age procured an admi&s;&s;ion into that Club, and after emancipating them&s;elves there from the re&s;traints of paternal authority, (which might perhaps have &s;upplied for &s;ome time the decline of public authority) acquired a decided &s;uperiority over tho&s;e of a more ad|vanced
<PB N="40" REF="033927_0024_0FF9FBDC49CC8F68">age and more &s;ober judgment. Nay, &s;o powerful was the delirium which then pervaded the public mind, that, &s;ince the in&s;titution of Trial by Jury took place, not one of them dared to convict any member of the Club, of any infringement of the public peace, however flagrant and atrocious it might be, and however &s;olicitous Govern|ment might be for their puni&s;hment. It was the more impo&s;&s;ible not to fore&s;ee that the impunity attending le&s;&s;er crimes, would inevitably encourage the perpetration of greater ones, as on each of the&s;e acquittals, it was ea&s;y to ob&s;erve the triumphs of the Central Club, which now gradually fell under the influence of a new &s;et of leaders of de&s;perate fortunes, who only &s;urpa&s;&s;ed each other by the violence of their re&s;pective motions, and who were alto|gether irre&s;pon&s;ible.</P>
<P>Such was the degenerated &s;tate of the Central Club, when <HI>Bou&s;quet</HI> was informed that it was ripe for the adop|tion and execution of his great and exten&s;ive plans of &s;ub|ver&s;ion and revolution, the daring wickedne&s;s of which, was the circum&s;tance the mo&s;t likely to en&s;ure their &s;ucce&s;s. The manner in which the event ju&s;tified his expectations, has been already related; and from the exact &s;imilarity between his mea&s;ures, re&s;ulting from &s;uch dangerous a&s;&s;oci|ations, and tho&s;e of the Jacobins at Paris, as well as between the con&s;equences of each, is irrefutably proved, the wi&s;dom of that Axiom in Politics, that <HI>Liberty can only be &s;ecure where power and re&s;pon&s;ibility are united.</HI></P>
<P>Such have been for Geneva the con&s;equences of the violation of that &s;alutary principle, that in one point only do we &s;till di&s;cover the true <HI>Geneve&s;e</HI> character; I mean in the jealous vigilance, with which both the oppre&s;&s;ors and the oppre&s;&s;ed, watch over their political independence, and have hitherto protected it from the treachery of France. Doubtle&s;s, the leaders of the Revolution find it more convenient to in&s;ult, and plunder their defencele&s;s Coun|trymen at home, than to be put in Requi&s;ition, and draughted into the armies of the Ocean, the Rhine, and the Pyrenees: but plunder mu&s;t have an end; and when the booty is &s;pent, what will then remain for them, but to &s;ell their unhappy country to the highe&s;t bidder?</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Revolution of <HI>Geneva</HI> &s;eems to take a milder turn, than might have been expected; owing, perhaps, to a change in the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>French,</HI> who appear to be relaxing from their &s;y&s;tem of &s;everity, or, more probably, to the return of the <HI>Geneve&s;e</HI> to their natu|ral character. Whatever be the cau&s;e, it is certain, that the latter begin to feel &s;ome remor&s;e for what they have done; and openly avow their regret for having &s;o long imitated, and (to &s;ay the truth) in every point but one, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the former.</P>
<P>In one point indeed, and in one point only, the <HI>French</HI> are &s;till without a rival; for out of no le&s;s than 508 per|&s;ons, on whom different &s;entences were pa&s;&s;ed, on the late occa&s;ion, there was but <HI>one</HI> Woman, who was condemned to be impri&s;oned for life, for having given a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and forwarded letters, to &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Emigrants; and it is more than probable, that even this &s;entence was obtained by the influence and intrigues of the <HI>French</HI> Re&s;ident. In every other re&s;pect, the <HI>Geneve&s;e</HI> have gone far beyond their model. One of the Judges, for in&s;tance, of the <HI>Revolutionary Tribunal,</HI> is &s;aid to have left the bench, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t in executing the unfortunate Magi&s;trates, whom he had ju&s;t condemned. In the &s;ame manner, tho&s;e who &s;entenced the Syndic <HI>Cayla</HI> to death, had the audacity to reckon, among his crimes, the large &s;ums, which he had long been in the habit of di&s;tributing among the Poor, with a view (as was alledged) of corrupting them. His bounty was, indeed, improperly applied, &s;ince the very objects of it were tho&s;e, who clamoured the loude&s;t for his death, and actually obtained it. They are now &s;orry that they did &s;o: their &s;orrow, however, does not pro|ceed from remor&s;e only, but is the con&s;equence of an event,
<PB N="43" REF="033927_0025_0FF9FBEE85F87140">which they little expected, and for which they were wholly unprepared.</P>
<P>You recollect, Sir, that the &s;econd Revolution, which took place on the 18th of July, 1794, was, in a great mea&s;ure, effected by the two Clubs of the <HI>Mar&s;eille&s;e</HI> and <HI>Mountaineers.</HI> Tho&s;e Clubs were compo&s;ed of the very dregs of the populace, and con&s;equently, could only be tools in the hands of others. But no &s;ooner was the &s;econd Revolution completely effected, than they who had conducted the former, adopted it, and with a view, either of &s;ecuring their own &s;afety, or perhaps of &s;haring the plunder, immediately endeavoured to put them&s;elves at the head of it.</P>
<P>Of cour&s;e, their fir&s;t object was, to &s;trip the <HI>French</HI> Re&s;ident of his influence. And in truth it was time to do &s;o; for there was now no doubt, that the only object of that Mini&s;ter, in forming the intere&s;t he had acquired among the Mountaineers, was to govern and guide them him&s;elf, and, by their means, ultimately to incorporate <HI>Geneva</HI> with <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But this Coalition, however unexpected, was not brought about &s;o expeditiou&s;ly, as to e&s;cape the penetration of <HI>Soulavie;</HI> who no &s;ooner di&s;covered it, than he deter|mined immediately to ha&s;ten to the execution of his plan.</P>
<P>At this critical moment, happened the fall, and imme|diately afterwards, the death of Rober&s;pierre, who&s;e crea|ture he was; an event which &s;eemed completely to bla&s;t his hopes; for his rivals were in&s;tantly joined by all the Geneve&s;e, who &s;till wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve the independence of their Country. The fir&s;t con&s;equence of that event, was a formal complaint lodged again&s;t him, with the French Mini&s;try, by the Syndics and Council.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The very day after they heard of Rober&s;pierre's defeat, the Con&s;ti|tutional Government wrote an an&s;wer to a very violent note, pre&s;ented by <HI>Soulavie,</HI> in which he expre&s;sly calls them <HI>the Enemies of France,</HI> and threatens them with no le&s;s, than <HI>arming the neighbouring Di&s;tricts</HI> again&s;t them. This an&s;wer contains a very &s;pirited recapitulation of the con|duct of <HI>Soulavie,</HI> and is the more curious, as it is a &s;triking &s;pecimen of the new Dyplomatic &s;tyle, which the Revolutionary Sy&s;tem has intro|duced.

<P>"Citizen Re&s;ident," &s;aid they, "The <HI>Syndies</HI> and <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Geneva</HI> have ever been aware of your ill-will towards both them and their Republic. They have long &s;een, that your conduct is directly cal|culated, to involve them in a di&s;pute with France: but their love of peace, and their re&s;pect for the character you &s;u&s;tain, has induced them to &s;uppre&s;s the unplea&s;ing &s;entiments, which &s;uch a &s;ight excited. But now that You &s;et them the example, by forgetting the re&s;pect You owe, to the Magi&s;trates of a free and independent people, they no longer withhold the expre&s;&s;ion of their indignation, and feel it a duty to repel your attacks, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not enumerate all our cau&s;es of complaint, again&s;t You.

Some facts it has wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; others it &s;tates imperfectly; and by artfully mi&s;repre&s;enting the re&s;t, gives room to &s;u&s;pect, that things of greater importance than tho&s;e it &s;tates, are behind.

Give us leave to tell You, Sir, that it is your ba&s;e and in&s;idious conduct alone, which will induce them to take &s;uch a &s;tep, or to form a bad opi|nion of us? Was it for this purpo&s;e that You were &s;ent to us? The Nation You repre&s;ent, has made Ju&s;tice and Integrity, the Order of the day: but its Mini&s;ter has wilfully and deliberately fal&s;ified the mo&s;t important facts, in order to criminate us: The Nation You repre&s;ent, wi&s;hes to fraterni&s;e with all other free Nations: but You, Sir, have abu&s;ed the authority of your &s;ituation, to commit your Country, with the only Nation, which has adopted its principles. We know, however, that the Committee of Public Safety will not condemn a whole people unheard: to it, we &s;hall addre&s;s our|&s;elves, and we know that we &s;hall be heard; the important truths we &s;hall di&s;clo&s;e, will have their effect. Your menaces do not terrify us: We even hear them with plea&s;ure, as they afford us a hope, that the intrigues and cabals You have been &s;o long forming again&s;t us, will &s;oon be at an end. This undi&s;gui&s;ed declaration of our &s;entiments, the&s;e bold truths, are the language of Freemen: If it offends You, the conduct which has occa&s;ioned it, will ju&s;tify it, and we &s;hall &s;tand acquitted by all who love &s;incerity and truth.

The daily allowance, which had been di&s;tributed for about three weeks, among the Clubs, and which had co&s;t the State 300 louis-d'ors a day, had been lately withdrawn, to the great di&s;&s;atisfaction of the Mar&s;eille&s;e and Moun|taineers, but particularly of the latter, who were thereby deprived of a re&s;ource which, while it la&s;ted, had made it unnece&s;&s;ary for them to return to their former employ|ments. To re&s;ume them now, was a mea&s;ure they were not at all inclined to; and their ill-humour increa&s;ed, as they began to feel the pre&s;&s;ure of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>They complained of having been amu&s;ed with the hope, that, as &s;oon as the new divi&s;ion of Property was made, every Patriot would have a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. They &s;aw with indignation, that their plunder was either wa&s;ted, or put out of their reach, as &s;oon as it was collected; and as it was impo&s;&s;ible either to &s;ell, or to let the &s;plendid hou&s;es, which had been confi&s;cated, both within the walls of the City, and in the neighbourhood, they in&s;i&s;ted on having them divided, and di&s;tributed in &s;hares. Far, al&s;o, from joining the majority of the Friends of the Revolution, in blaming the conduct and de&s;igns of the French Re&s;ident, the Mountaineers flocked in great numbers to his hou&s;e; &s;upported him again&s;t the mo&s;t popular Members of the <HI>Government;</HI> and in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing the rea&s;ons <HI>of the mi&s;under&s;tanding between him and them, which,</HI> they &s;aid, <HI>was too prejudicial to the intere&s;ts of the Republic, to be kept a &s;ecret.</HI></P>
<P>But however they might regret, in private, that the Revolution had not had the effect of making <HI>Geneva,</HI> a part of the <HI>French</HI> Republic, they were not yet bold enough, openly to a&s;&s;ign that as the rea&s;on of their di&s;&s;a|tisfaction. They made no &s;cruple, however, of declaring loudly, that the vengeance of the nation was not yet &s;ati&s;|fied; and in&s;i&s;ted, that the <HI>Revolutionary Tribunal</HI> &s;hould re&s;ume its functions, and bring to ju&s;tice, between five and &s;ix hundred more per&s;ons, who, they &s;aid, had been hitherto &s;pared, though clearly guilty, and in which num|ber, they at la&s;t expre&s;sly, and by name, included tho&s;e <HI>Revolutioni&s;ts,</HI> who were known to be the mo&s;t attached to the pre&s;ervation of the National independence, as well as
<PB N="46" REF="033927_0027_0FF9FC166509FEA0">&s;ome, whom <HI>Soulavie</HI> pointed out to them, as his own <HI>per|&s;onal enemies,</HI> and who were, in fact, the principal Mem|bers of the Government, but whom he cho&s;e to call by the name of Tempori&s;ers and Moderates. The&s;e la&s;t were particularly obnoxious to the Mountaineers, and had in|curred their mo&s;t violent hatred, by con&s;tantly checking them, whenever, after the completion of the fir&s;t Revolu|tion, that undi&s;ciplined and &s;avage mob wanted to horry on to a &s;econd, before <HI>Bou&s;quet</HI> arrived to point out the proper time for beginning it.</P>
<P>The&s;e threats of per&s;onal danger rou&s;ed the Members of the <HI>Con&s;titutional Government,</HI> and induced them, though &s;till to a certain degree under &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, to re&s;ume the authority they had affected to want on the 18th of July. The re&s;t of the <HI>Revolutionary Clubs</HI> were immediately called together, and in one of them, the feelings of the Members excited by a &s;peech, in which the ma&s;k was &s;o completely laid a&s;ide, that it would be unpardonable not to lay &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of it before you.</P>
<P>"I maintain," &s;aid the Revolutioni&s;t who delivered it, <Q>that the &s;cheme of erecting a new <HI>Revolutionary Tri|bunal,</HI> can have originated only in an enemy to the inde|pendence of our Country: nor can it meet with &s;upport, but from the mo&s;t deluded, or from tho&s;e who are too indolent to return to their former employments, and who know, that until the tranquillity of the State is re&s;tored, they mu&s;t be continued in arms, and con&s;equently, &s;up|ported at the public expence. For what but the com|plete&s;t ignorance, or the mo&s;t wicked malice, can &s;ugge&s;t any apprehen&s;ions now, from what was once the Ari&s;to|cratical party in <HI>Geneva,</HI> and which the lo&s;s of its wealth, and the fall of Monarchy in <HI>France,</HI> have completely reduced to in&s;ignificance, without power at home, or in|fluence abroad? &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><Q>France has made Ju&s;tice the Order of the day: yet in <HI>Geneva,</HI> which &s;hould be a City of Brothers, there are men to be found, who &s;till thir&s;t for blood, and call for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of another <HI>Revolutionary Tribunal,</HI> with no limit to its authority, but its own capricious will. Is there no rea&s;on to fear, that the re&s;pectable Powers, on
<PB N="47" REF="033927_0027_0FF9FC166509FEA0">whom we depend for our &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and for the pro|&s;perity of our trade, and who have already &s;o &s;trongly marked their di&s;approbation of our conduct, will no longer &s;uppre&s;s their indignation? And &s;hould that be the ca&s;e, is there no rea&s;on to fear that <HI>Geneva,</HI> the native Country of <HI>Rou&s;&s;eau,&mdash;Geneva,</HI> who&s;e Citizens had, by their calm and temperate behaviour, even in the mid&s;t of inte&s;tine di&s;cords, by the purity of their morals, by their piety, by the brilliancy of their talents, and the extent of their knowledge, obtained the e&s;teem and re&s;pect of all <HI>Europe,</HI>&mdash;that <HI>Geneva</HI> may lo&s;e its independence, and no longer be permitted to call her&s;elf free? Let us in|&s;tantly reject a propo&s;al &s;o dangerous,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This harangue was very much applauded, and when printed, revived the courage of all tho&s;e who had been con|cerned in effecting the fir&s;t Revolution, as well as of tho&s;e who, though equally aver&s;e to the fir&s;t and &s;econd, had, from motives of fear or prudence, &s;ubmitted to both. They immediately re&s;olved to arm them&s;elves, but to receive no pay; to revive the <HI>Revolutionary Tribunal,</HI> but at the &s;ame time, to direct its &s;everity, not again&s;t tho&s;e who were fal&s;ely called and treated as Ari&s;tocrates, but towards tho&s;e, who were endeavouring, under the ma&s;k of Patrioti&s;m, to involve their Country in farther confu&s;ion, and to give up its independence.</P>
<P>Having, by the&s;e mea&s;ures, obtained a decided &s;upe|riority, they &s;till proceeded with great caution, and were particularly careful not to alarm the Mar&s;eille&s;e, who were more numerous, and, if po&s;&s;ible, more eager for blood than the Mountaineers; but at the &s;ame time, more under the controul of their Leaders, le&s;s in the habit of looking up to the <HI>French</HI> Re&s;ident, and more attached to the idea of National independence. By this conduct, they detached them by degrees from their former A&s;&s;ociates, the Moun|taineers; who, being thus abandoned, were &s;urrounded, di&s;armed, and thrown into pri&s;on, without offering to make the &s;lighte&s;t re&s;i&s;tance; though, when they clamoured for the death of the acquitted Magi&s;trates, the very men, who now ma&s;tered them &s;o ea&s;ily, affected to con&s;ider them as invincible.</P>

The new Tribunal, which con&s;i&s;ted of the &s;ame Mem|bers as before, was very careful, however, in the exerci&s;e of its authority, to &s;pare &s;uch of the Mountaineers, as had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their zeal on the former occa&s;ion; and endeavoured to divert the public indigna|tion from them, by calling for accu&s;ations again&s;t &s;uch of the more wealthy Citizens, as had hitherto e&s;caped, and were &s;till <HI>incorrigible Enemies</HI> of the Revolution.

<P>When the books and papers of the Mountaineers were &s;eized, the plan of an Addre&s;s to the People, was found among them, the object of which was, to bring about a <HI>third</HI> Revolution. It e&s;pou&s;ed the quarrel of the French Re&s;ident, in the opene&s;t manner, and a&s;ked in plain terms, <HI>how long the Enemies of the French Nation were to in&s;ult it with impunity?</HI></P>
<P>This addre&s;s (which was evidently drawn up by <HI>Sou|lavie</HI>)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Among other pa&s;&s;ages, is the following very curious one:</HI> The good will of the Mountaineers towards France, expo&s;es them to all the malig|nity of the Enemies of that Nation, who impri&s;on them, calumniate them, oppre&s;s them by unju&s;t pro&s;ecutions, and do all in their power to di&s;unite them, by dividing them into new Clubs, exactly in the &s;ame manner as <HI>PITT</HI> per&s;ecutes the Oppo&s;ition in England, for favouring the cau&s;e of France.</NOTE> was directly calculated to put the <HI>Revolutioni&s;ts</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="033927_0028_0FF9FC29D3F4D360">them&s;elves into confu&s;ion, and force them to throw them|&s;elves into the arms of France; though it affected to treat the imputation of any &s;uch de&s;ign, as a gro&s;s and &s;lan|derous fal&s;ehood. It has been &s;aid, that by means of a chemical proce&s;s, &s;ome of the names which had been &s;igned to this paper and afterwards era&s;ed, were re&s;tored; and that, among others, was that of <HI>Soulavie.</HI> However this may have been, the confe&s;&s;ions of &s;uch of the Moun|taineers, as were taken into cu&s;tody, left no doubt of the nature of that Mini&s;ter's views and conduct.</P>
<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Mr. <HI>Reybaz,</HI> the Geneve&s;e Mini&s;ter in <HI>France,</HI> a man of real merit, and very highly e&s;teemed in <HI>Paris,</HI> (whom no one &s;u&s;pects of approving the conduct of his new Con&s;tituents, though all were &s;ur|pri&s;ed that he continued to fill his &s;ituation under them) being perfectly appri&s;ed of the &s;cheme, that was formed again&s;t the independence of his Country, took advantage of the fall of <HI>Rober&s;pierre,</HI> to defeat it.&mdash;He not only prevailed upon tho&s;e, who &s;ucceeded <HI>Rober&s;pierre,</HI> to di&s;|avow the conduct of <HI>Soulavie,</HI> and to recall him with marks of di&s;plea&s;ure; but he al&s;o obtained from the Con|vention, a new and &s;olemn acknowledgement of the Independence of <HI>Geneva,</HI> and an allowance of the &s;ame honours to him&s;elf, as its repre&s;entative, as had lately been granted to the Mini&s;ter of the <HI>United States of America.</HI> In his official corre&s;pondence, he took particular care to let his Con&s;tituents know, that the account of the late Revolution, which they had intended, no doubt, for the peru&s;al of <HI>Rober&s;pierre,</HI> had reached his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, at the very moment, when they had determined to adopt a line of conduct, the very rever&s;e of his: that the principles on which they meant to act, were tho&s;e of Ju&s;tice, Huma|nity, and Moderation; and that their intention was to &s;hew them&s;elves, not more the foes of Ari&s;tocracy, than of Anarchy and In&s;ubordination.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="033927_0029_0FF9FC427AB17B70">
The &s;tate of affairs being thus &s;o e&s;&s;entially altered, the <HI>Revolutionary Tribunal</HI> could no longer refu&s;e to proceed to the trial of the <HI>Mountaineers.</HI> And although no po&s;itive evidence was adduced, of a plot to deliver up the City into the hands of the <HI>French,</HI> and though the individuals accu&s;ed, made the mo&s;t public and &s;olemn declaration, that every &s;tep, for which they were now called to an&s;wer, was taken by the in&s;tigation, and under the immediate direction, of the very men, who were then &s;itting in judgment on them, yet four of that party received &s;en|tence of death. The Populace, who but &s;ix weeks before, had been the accomplices, and in&s;truments of their crimes, heard the &s;entence with tran&s;port; and the Criminals met their fate in a manner as da&s;tardly, as the behaviour of the Magi&s;trates, whom they had murdered, was courageous and dignified. Thus has &s;o &s;mall a State as <HI>Geneva,</HI> already proved, at the expence of the very men, who con|temptuou&s;ly called the Revolution, <HI>an abortive one,</HI> the ju&s;tne&s;s of the remark of a great Revolutionary Leader in France,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Danton.</NOTE> a few moments before he &s;ubmitted to the Guillotine.&mdash;<HI>Every Revolution,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>of the nature of ours, is like Saturn: it devours its own offspring.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bou&s;quet,</HI> the real head of the <HI>Mountaineer</HI> party, is &s;till alive: but he lives in hourly apprehen&s;ions of &s;haring the fate of his accomplices. That <HI>Rober&s;pierre</HI> of <HI>Geneva,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the vices, and none of the talents of his model, and who like him, ruled his country for a &s;hort time, with unlimited &s;way, has not been able to retain his u&s;urped Authority.&mdash;That he might have a plau&s;ible pre|text, for no longer continuing a member of a Tribunal, who&s;e cruelties he affected to condemn, he has, with equal dexterity and ba&s;ene&s;s, contrived to withdraw his name from the number of tho&s;e who were to decide on the lives of their Countrymen, and to have it in&s;erted in the Com|mi&s;&s;ion, to which the ta&s;k of confi&s;cating their property, was allotted: and now, equally dreading the vengeance of tho&s;e he has ruined, and the contempt of tho&s;e who &s;hared his crimes, he is rapidly &s;inking into his original
<PB N="51" REF="033927_0029_0FF9FC427AB17B70">ob&s;curity, and already verifies the prediction of one of his Countrymen (Mr. <HI>Chauvet</HI>), who, in a Letter from Lon|don, of the 15th of Augu&s;t, told him, <HI>that he would pre|&s;erve only the &s;hadow of authority, by &s;ubmitting to acts of the ba&s;e&s;t compliance.</HI> "Tho&s;e who overturn the Laws," continued he, <Q>are Tyrants to-day, only to be Slaves to-morrow; and are &s;uffered to exi&s;t, amid&s;t the con|tempt of their a&s;&s;ociates, and the hatred of their rivals, only until they have &s;atiated the avidity of the one, and prepared the way for the triumph of the other</Q> The Letter ended with the&s;e prophetic words: <Q>I do not &s;ay, that political Crimes have always led to the ruin of tho&s;e, who commit them; I do not &s;ay, that the popularity which is obtained by &s;uch means, is as un&s;table as it is contemptible: nor do I &s;ay, that a thou&s;and accidents may change that Order of things, which now &s;eems &s;o favourable to You. But I &s;ay, that the hour is at hand, when you will envy the fate of tho&s;e, who have fallen &s;acrifices to the Revolution you have effected,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The puni&s;hment, which the inferior Agents of the late Revolution have already &s;uffered, has encouraged the <HI>Geneve&s;e</HI> to hope, that the vengeance of Providence will &s;oon overtake the principal Criminals, and afford the unhappy victims of their ambition, &s;ome alleviation of their mi&s;ery, and perhaps, an opportunity of e&s;caping from a City which is become the harbour of every crime. Some, indeed, have already obtained, by means of money, a commutation of their &s;entence of confinement to their own hou&s;es, into perpetual exile. And who can wonder, that they &s;hould con&s;ider it as an indulgence, that can hardly be bought too dearly, to be bani&s;hed from a City, who&s;e &s;treets are reeking with the blood of innocent and virtuous men; where the hopes of plunder are the only bonds of an union, which the divi&s;ion of it mu&s;t &s;oon di&s;&s;olve; where the populace was encouraged to pillage, in order to be taken into pay; and was kept in pay, in order to pillage; where property is lo&s;t to its owners, without enriching or &s;atiating the robbers: a City, who&s;e

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE appearance of moderation, which things &s;eemed to wear at Geneva, when I la&s;t had the honour to addre&s;s You, was &s;oon laid a&s;ide; and we are now to &s;ee the Re|volution, in its genuine and original character, as a &s;y&s;|tem of anarchy, deva&s;tation and plunder.</P>
<P>You may recollect, that at the date of my la&s;t letter, the Mountaineers were completely humbled; <HI>Soulavie</HI> was recalled, and the Convention had made declarations, which, if &s;incere, rendered all apprehen&s;ions of danger from the French, groundle&s;s. Under circum&s;tances &s;o favourable, the Revolutionary Tribunal thought it unnece&s;|&s;ary to wear the ma&s;k any longer. It declared it to be unju&s;t, that its &s;everity &s;hould be exerci&s;ed on deluded patriots only; and thought it high time to take the ca&s;es of &s;uch of the <HI>Enemies of Liberty and Equality,</HI> as had been lately ordered not to leave their own hou&s;es, into con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The number of per&s;ons of that de&s;cription amounted to 343. They were principally of the cla&s;s of Merchants, or, as the Revolutioni&s;ts affected to call them, <HI>trading Ari&s;tocrats,</HI> and had attracted their notice, as being in their opinion, as rich, and more avaricious, than tho&s;e they had already attacked.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem, that for the&s;e two years pa&s;t, the more virtuous and enlightened part of the <HI>Geneve&s;e</HI> have laboured under a &s;ort of infatuation, which by an ill-timed &s;pirit of moderation and forbearance, have drawn upon them the very dangers, they mo&s;t wi&s;hed to avoid. The&s;e very men, for in&s;tance, who&s;e turn of per&s;ecution was now come, had been weak enough to believe, that the late military preparations were made with no other view than to provide for their &s;afety, and the &s;ecurity of the National independence.

<P>The members of this Tribunal were (as has been already ob&s;erved) almo&s;t entirely taken from the lower Cla&s;&s;es of the People, and were wholly unknown, before the late convul&s;ions. On this account, the de&s;cription they give of their rivals, the Mountaineer leaders, is equally curious and in&s;tructive.

To the former &s;uch periods are u&s;eful, as they afford them an opportunity of emerging from ob&s;curity; to the latter, as they enable them to efface the remembrance of their pri|vate infamy, by the affectation of public virtues. <HI>Both are equally active, both equally influenced by their own &s;elfi&s;h views; both con&s;ider all means as allowable, which tend to the attainment of tho&s;e views; and under the ma&s;k of patrioti&s;m, both turn the holy duty of in&s;urrections again&s;t the real intere&s;ts of the in&s;urgents.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Twelve months ago, a popular Society was formed, called the Club of the <HI>Mountaineers,</HI> who undertook to act as <HI>&s;entinels of liberty.</HI> Under this name, which, to the minds of Frenchmen, imported every thing re&s;pectable, they endeavoured to depo&s;e the popular au|thorities of <HI>Geneva,</HI> to de&s;troy what the Revolution had rai&s;ed, and to plunge their Country into that &s;tate of confu&s;ion, which was mo&s;t favourable to the views of tho&s;e who had long been planning its ruin. One circum&s;tance alone protected the&s;e Con&s;pirators from the puni&s;h|ment their crime de&s;erved. The hou&s;e of the <HI>French</HI> Re&s;ident was their place of rendezvous, and the &s;cene of their &s;ecret and nocturnal cabals. That Mini&s;ter, who was &s;ent hither for the purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving harmony and friend&s;hip between the two Nations, took advantage of his &s;ituation to impo&s;e upon his Con&s;tituents, to injure us in their e&s;teem, to &s;ow di&s;&s;en&s;ions among our patriots; in &s;hort, to e&s;tabli&s;h Anarchy in <HI>Geneva..</HI>..It was impo&s;&s;ible however, that &s;uch conduct &s;hould be permitted for any length of time. The re&s;pect to which he was entitled, while he bore a public character, was nece&s;&s;arily withdrawn, when he engaged in intrigues, in fal&s;ehoods, in calum|nies. His behaviour could not long remain unknown; and it was impo&s;&s;ible that the French Republic, which generou&s;ly offers us <HI>good|will</HI> and <HI>fraternity,</HI> would &s;uffer a Man who was guilty of &s;uch crimes, to continue to repre&s;ent her! and &s;he will undoubtedly puni&s;h him as he de&s;erves, for daring to expo&s;e his country, by his ba&s;e and per|fidious conduct, to the danger of &s;eeing the Helvetic Body added to the number of its enemies.</Q></P></NOTE>.

In the mean time, the powers of the General A&s;&s;embly are intru&s;ted to twenty-three Clubs, or Revolutionary Sections, in which, the Members give their votes <HI>viv&acirc; voce,</HI> and in which none dare open their lips but tho&s;e, to whom a &s;tate of tranquillity is a &s;tate of violence; and who&s;e audacity increa&s;es with the timidity, and acqui|e&s;cence of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e twenty-three deliberative Republics, as they may be called, meet twice a day, and &s;ometimes collectively, &s;ometimes &s;eparately, form re&s;olutions the mo&s;t incon|&s;i&s;tent and contradictory: &s;ometimes, they permit the workmen, who are under &s;entence of confinement to their own hou&s;es, to go to their &s;hops three times a day; and immediately after they retract this permi&s;&s;ion.

The que&s;tion, which has hitherto mo&s;t embarra&s;&s;ed the Revolutioni&s;ts, is to determine, whether they &s;hall conti|nue the admini&s;tration of affairs in the hands of the Revo|lutionary Tribunal, or re&s;tore it to the Con&s;titutional Go|vernment, which, though &s;u&s;pended, is not di&s;&s;olved, nor without hopes of being able to re&s;ume its authority. For the pre&s;ent, it is agreed, that the Tribunal &s;hall remain another month in office, under the title of <HI>National Liqui|datory Commi&s;&s;ion;</HI> with expre&s;s orders to collect all the confi&s;cated property, and apply it to the &s;upport of E&s;ta|bli&s;hments <HI>for the encouragement of indu&s;try, the prevention of poverty, and the promotion of general happine&s;s,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides this, I am informed, that the new Commi&s;&s;ion has it in contemplation to lay &s;uch taxes, as, eventually, will tend to equalize all private fortunes, and re&s;tore <HI>the Golden Age,</HI> which, the People is told, will be the <HI>beginning of the reign of Equality, and the completion of the Revolution.</HI></NOTE> which, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch effectual means to introduce it, is &s;till, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of the lower cla&s;&s;es of the People, as di&s;tant as ever.</P>
<P>But though the minds of the public are thus buoyed up with hopes of future happine&s;s, they are not the le&s;s ex|po&s;ed to pre&s;ent remor&s;e and anxiety. It is not in the power of their Leaders to conceal from them, that they are con&s;idered as a worthle&s;s and degenerate People, by every part of Europe. Holland, the ancient Ally of Geneva, looks upon the pre&s;ent Magi&s;trates, as a &s;et of Banditti, and in order to pre&s;erve the property of tho&s;e, who are trembling under their tyranny, has put it into &s;eque&s;tration. Some of the principal trading Towns of Germany have prohibited all commercial intercour&s;e with them. The Swi&s;s have placed guards along their frontiers, to prevent the entrance of all per&s;ons concerned in the Revolution, or who were in arms while it was carrying on; and refu&s;e them admittance with as much care, as if they were infected with the plague.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Since the date of this letter, I have heard that the &s;everity of the&s;e mea&s;ures had been con&s;iderably relaxed; but they clearly &s;hew what the Powers who adopted them, think of the Revolution.</NOTE></P>
<P>But though the&s;e are facts too notorious to be concealed, the pre&s;ent Government endeavours to per&s;uade the deluded
<PB N="60" REF="033927_0034_0FF9CD1C893CA3A8">People, that, however they are abhorred by their imme|diate neighbours and connexions, they are not without friends and admirers, at a di&s;tance. For this purpo&s;e, on the fir&s;t of la&s;t month, they gave orders for a Civic Fea&s;t, in which, in allu&s;ion to the compliment lately paid them by the <HI>French,</HI> and to &s;hew them&s;elves not unworthy of a compari&s;on with the great Republic of the new World, they pompou&s;ly di&s;played the <HI>American</HI> flag, and with great effrontery placed it next to their own. It was ea&s;y indeed, to &s;ee &s;hame and remor&s;e, painted on the countenance of every per&s;on pre&s;ent at the ceremony. But what are we to think of a People, which retains no quality of virtue, but the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, nor any mark of courage, but the ob&s;tinacy of per&s;everance?</P>
<P>There is now hardly one <HI>Genevan</HI> of property, or educa|tion, who has not &s;everely felt the effects of the Revolu|tion. In fact, if to the former 508 victims, we add the la&s;t 343, we &s;hall find, that it has &s;wept away nearly one half of tho&s;e who compo&s;ed the General a&s;&s;embly, before the late introduction of about 1000 Natives, and nearly the &s;ame number of Foreigners.</P>
<P>To complete the &s;hocking picture, the <HI>French</HI> &s;oldiers them&s;elves, who were in &s;ome degree the in&s;truments of the Revolution, could not refrain from tears, at the bare recital of &s;ome of the &s;cenes, which took place in the cour&s;e of it.

<P>That &s;uch are nece&s;&s;arily the <HI>ultimate con&s;equences</HI> of their principles, the Jacobins of every age know perfectly well; but in no in&s;tance, has it been their object to pu&s;h their principles to their <HI>ultimate con&s;equences;</HI> &s;uch a &s;light and temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the laws of Society, &s;uch a partial <HI>di&s;organization,</HI> (to u&s;e the jargon of the modern School) as will put them into the &s;eats of tho&s;e in who&s;e hands power or property are now lodged, is all they wi&s;h for, or aim at: more would defeat their purpo&s;e; and he mu&s;t be, not only a negligent reader of Hi&s;tory, but an inattentive ob&s;erver of what pa&s;&s;es in our own times; and in our own neighbourhood, who does not know, that tho&s;e who rai&s;e them|&s;elves to greatne&s;s by violating the great principles of Social Order, are as anxious, when they feel them&s;elves firm in their &s;eats, to re&s;tore and maintain tho&s;e principles, and puni&s;h every imitation of their own conduct, or application of their own doctrines, as &s;everely, as if they were the legitimate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the &s;ituations they have u&s;urped.</P>
<P>In truth, no Revolution, effected upon <HI>Jacobinical</HI> principles, has ever had, or ever can have, any other effect, than that of transferring property and power into new hands, at the expence of ju&s;tice, humanity, private happine&s;s, and public tranquillity. On all &s;uch occa&s;ions, the great Ma&s;s of the People, who&s;e intere&s;t is the pretext, as its credulity is the in&s;trument of the Revolution, has ever found, and ever will find, that <Q><HI>the holy duty of In&s;urrection</HI> (to u&s;e the words of the Genevan Tribunal) <HI>is turned again&s;t the In&s;urgents:</HI></Q> it will di&s;cover, by the tone of its new Ma&s;ters, that every thing around it has changed, except its own condition; and will return, di&s;appointed and mortified, to its former &s;ituation, with nothing to con&s;ole it for the interruption of its happine&s;s, and the lo&s;s of its innocence. In Geneva, where the people of property have all been either plundered or driven away, the indu&s;|trious poor already compare their &s;ituation to that of a Town on the Banks of a River, the inhabitants of which have, in a fit of madne&s;s, turned the &s;tream into another bed.</P></NOTE></P>

It is extremely probable, that the Leaders of the Revo|lution were not, at fir&s;t, aware of the con&s;equences of what they were doing in 1792, or of the dangers to which the introduction of the French doctrines expo&s;ed them; and that, if it had been po&s;&s;ible at that time to &s;hew them the &s;eries of horrors, and crimes, into which they would be progre&s;&s;ively led, they would have &s;huddered at the thought of what it is now their boa&s;t to have effected.

It is di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to humanity to reflect, that a fate &s;o melancholy &s;hould have been re&s;erved for a city &s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;hed as Geneva was, for the generous and benevolent &s;pirit of its inhabitants, and the alacrity with which tho&s;e in ea&s;y circum&s;tances always &s;tepped forward to relieve the wants, and alleviate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their fellow-citizens; where, in &s;hort, the Syndic <HI>Cayla</HI> was not the only per&s;on, who devoted a large proportion of his income to the poor, and, in the admini&s;tration of it, con&s;idered him&s;elf as only their Steward.

<P N="1">1. That a &s;ingle Revolution, if conducted with mode|ration, and not carried too far, may &s;ometimes prove the foundation of Liberty; but that a &s;econd, and all &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive Revolutions, are the certain bane and de&s;truction of it; for the inevitable con&s;equence of all &s;uch events, is to make the people indifferent to liberty; and indifference, we know, is &s;oon &s;ucceeded by di&s;gu&s;t, as di&s;gu&s;t is ea&s;ily increa&s;ed into aver&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. That however a Nation may be accu&s;tomed to civil commotions, a Revolution, in the modern &s;en&s;e of the term, is certainly the greate&s;t evil that can befall it.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the fir&s;t Authors of every &s;uch Revolution, are uniformly the &s;econd victims to it.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the moral character of the mo&s;t virtuous Na|tion, affords no &s;ecurity whatever, that Revolutionary Doctrines, if &s;uffered to be propagated in it, will have a le&s;s pernicious influence upon its manners, than upon tho&s;e of any other Nation. It is impo&s;&s;ible that tho&s;e doctrines can take root in any &s;uch Nation, without pro|ducing a complete, and radical change in its character. It is barely two months &s;ince the Geneve&s;e de&s;ervedly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the reputation of a brave and humane People. One &s;ingle night of Revolution, by putting the arms which had been wre&s;ted from the people of property, into the hands of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed nothing, in&s;tantly changed the former into da&s;tardly cowards, and the latter into ferocious bea&s;ts of prey.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="67" REF="033927_0037_0FF9CD37E8D8C1B0">
5. That wherever a Revolution upon French Principles makes its appearance, it will infallibly begin, at the very point at which the French ended; viz. by making <HI>terror the order of the day,</HI> by de&s;troying religion, and the order of Society; and by expo&s;ing property to promi&s;|cuous pillage, and the owners of it to pro&s;cription and de&s;truction.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the fate of the civilized part of the World, and indeed, of human nature it&s;elf, depends, at this critical moment, upon the conduct of the People of Property. They cannot now be ignorant of their danger; and they may be a&s;&s;ured, that timidity and di&s;union are more ruinous to their cau&s;e than any exertions of their Enemies, and that the moment they &s;uffer their re&s;olution to be &s;haken, their ruin is inevitable.</P>
<P N="7">7. That the new Revolutionary Doctrines are more de&s;tructive in free States than el&s;ewhere; becau&s;e free States have nothing to add to Liberty but the abu&s;e of it, and con&s;equently, nothing to adopt from &s;uch doctrines, but the exce&s;&s;es to which they lead.</P>
<P N="8">8. That it is plain from the example of Geneva, that free States are the mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the introduction of tho&s;e principles; becau&s;e it is in free States only, that the forms of Government, give an opportunity of turning liberty into licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s into crimes of the deepe&s;t dye.</P>
<P N="9">9. That every Nation which has the happine&s;s to enjoy a temperate and well-regulated Liberty, may be a&s;&s;ured, that the only means to pre&s;erve it, is to ri&s;e in a ma&s;s, and repre&s;s the fir&s;t attempt to abu&s;e it, with as much vigour as they would oppo&s;e the fir&s;t encroachments of Power.</P>
<P>With the&s;e reflexions I &s;hall clo&s;e this melancholy narra|tive; and I am &s;ure, Sir, it is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to de&s;cribe to You, the feelings that ri&s;e in the bo&s;om of a Genevan, who once fondly loved his country, when he feels him&s;elf bound by his duty as an Hi&s;torian, and by the &s;acred regard he owes to truth, to hold up the conduct of that country, and the calamities that have followed from it, as a
<PB N="68" REF="033927_0038_0FF9FCE8A3C800F0">warning to the re&s;t of mankind. That duty I have di&s;|charged to the be&s;t of my power, and my painful ta&s;k is over. The Revolution is now complete; it has already a&s;&s;umed the general hue of all &s;uch events; and the hi&s;tory of Geneva will hereafter be the hi&s;tory of the great Planet to which &s;he is become a &s;atellite. Her boa&s;ted independence is now an empty &s;ound; and her &s;ons have nothing left, but to lament her fate in &s;ilence.</P>

<P>BY the la&s;t accounts from Geneva, it appears, that &s;ince the fall of the Mountaineers and their pation <HI>Soulavic,</HI> all fears of an inva&s;ion from France are laid a&s;ide: that Na|tion entered on the 7th of la&s;t September into a new &s;olemn engagement, to take no &s;tep that &s;hall, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, affect the independence of its neighbour. For this engagement, however, we are not &s;o much in|debted to any new principle of Ju&s;tice operating on the minds of the French, as to their per&s;ua&s;ion, that Geneva is in reality, though not in name, their own; and that their tools, the Revolutioni&s;ts, have gone &s;uch lengths, and committed them&s;elves &s;o completely, as to be a much better garri&s;on for them, than any number of their own troops could be.</P>
<P>The tyrants of that unfortunate city have therefore &s;heathed the &s;word, and now turn their whole attention to the pro&s;ecution of the &s;y&s;tem of quiet plunder, which their &s;ucce&s;s has enabled them to e&s;tabli&s;h. For this purpo&s;e, and either to introduce the equalizing principle more effectually, or perhaps to &s;hew the world, how far they can go beyond their ma&s;ters, they pa&s;&s;ed a Decree on the 28th of September, by which they laid the &s;ame enor|mou&s;ly unju&s;t tax, upon the Capital of every man's fortune, which the French financiers had been &s;atisfied with levying upon one <HI>annual income</HI> only.</P>
<P>With this view, after dividing all the people of property into three Cla&s;&s;es, which they di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of <HI>Ari&s;tocrates, Indifferents,</HI> and <HI>Patriots,</HI> they applied to each of tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es, a &s;cale of A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, proceeding in geometrical progre&s;&s;ion, by means of which each indivi|dual
<PB N="70" REF="033927_0039_0FF9CC334339A730">was rated, not according to the value of his E&s;tate, but al&s;o according to an arbitrary e&s;timate of his poli|tical opinions.&mdash;With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t Cla&s;s, the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is made on all fortunes amounting to &pound;. 300 &s;terling or upwards, and increa&s;es as they increa&s;e, till it reaches 40 per cent. on the Capital. Upon the E&s;tates of the Indifferents, it begins at &pound;. 300, but does not extend to more than 30 per cent. on the Capital.&mdash;The E&s;tates of the Patriots are wholly exempted under the value of &pound;. 300 &s;terling, and are liable only to the amount of &pound;. 25 per cent. on capitals above that &s;um.</P>
<P>The projectors of this extraordinary mea&s;ure, have not failed to repre&s;ent it as &s;ugge&s;ted by nece&s;&s;ity, and from its &s;everity, not likely to be repeated. But it is affirmed that they have already in &s;everal in&s;tances violated their own rule; and even though they &s;hould adhere to it more &s;trictly in future, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that under this &s;pecies of Agrarian Law, (the only one which a State po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o &s;mall a territory could adopt) the ruin of every Gene|van in ea&s;y circum&s;tances is inevitable; and if it be con|tinued, every incitement to indu&s;try and hone&s;t exertion, mu&s;t be removed; though the authors of it are not a&s;hamed to a&s;&s;ert, that in order to realize the good effects of it, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport it by a general di&s;po|&s;ition to <HI>indu&s;try. In a Republic,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>that is well con|&s;tituted, or de&s;ires to be &s;o, indolence is a crime again&s;t the State, and is not too &s;everely puni&s;hed by infamy and bani&s;h|ment.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, the con&s;equence of the mea&s;ure has been to reduce the little property that was left in land or hou&s;es, to half its value. The unhappy Proprietors pay what is demanded of them, without oppo&s;ition or remon&s;trance, and are glad to purcha&s;e with what remains, leave to quit the abode of &s;uch jealous and rapacious Ty|ranny.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One Gentleman was taxed to the amount of &pound;, 16,000 &s;terling: among others Mr. <HI>J. Tronchin,</HI> though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a landed e&s;tate of the value of upwards of &pound;. 20,000 &s;terling, rather cho&s;e to abandon it, than to be plundered of his ready money, and by &s;taying, hold his other property expo&s;ed to &s;ub&s;equent depredations. It is confidently &s;aid, that the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment has produced about &pound;. 600,000 &s;terling, amounting to nearly a third of the whole property in <HI>Geneva,</HI> and levied in a Town, the greater part of who&s;e inhabitants had already lo&s;t four-fifths of their fortunes, by the depreciation of the a&s;&s;ignats, in which the French pay the intere&s;t of their public debt, to tho&s;e of their foreign creditors, who&s;e payments they have not &s;u&s;pended.</NOTE></P>

On one account indeed, this increa&s;ing depopulation is de&s;irable; but on another it is to be regretted, as it coincides with, and is indeed a part of, the plan of the Leaders of the Revolution, who rejoice at it, and con&s;ider it as the only means of confirming their triumph, and making their &s;y&s;tem permanent. <HI>Ubi &s;olitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>In the mean time, tho&s;e Revolutioni&s;ts who&s;e fortunes brought them within the line of the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, execrate a &s;y&s;tem which makes them the &s;poil of their own victory,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Pe&s;tre,</HI> a very zealous partizan of the Revolution, has lately been bold enough to circulate a pamphlet in <HI>Geneva</HI> with his name affixed to it, which completely &s;ub&s;tantiates the facts &s;tated in the pre|ceding Letters. The di&s;coveries it makes are the more worthy of notice, as they exhibit a perfect picture of the remor&s;e, that uniformly follows the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch crimes, as have been perpetrated in <HI>Geneva.</HI>
<P>After &s;hewing from ancient Hi&s;tory, and even from the hi&s;tory of <HI>Geneva,</HI> that bani&s;hment for political offences has, at all times, been highly injurious to the State that adopted it, "It remains," &s;ays the author, <Q>for me to give my opinion on the propriety of recalling tho&s;e, whom we have driven into exile, and which I &s;hall do with all the freedom of a known friend of Liberty and Equality. In my opinion, ju&s;tice, prudence, and humanity, unite in favour of the mea&s;ure. The &s;tate of the Arts among us, our Trade, our Manufactures loudly call for it. Nothing el&s;e can put a period to our mi&s;ery. There is not now a &s;ingle per&s;on in <HI>Geneva,</HI> who can look with|out tears at the long li&s;t of Citizens, whom the frenzy of the moment has forced to take &s;helter in foreign Countries. What crime had they been guilty of? They had, &s;ay You, formed a de&s;ign to overturn the very Con&s;titution, which they had lately accepted: But what proof is there of any &s;uch de&s;ign? None. Not a tittle of any was &s;ugge&s;ted, in the examinations which &s;ome of them under|went. This pretended plot therefore, has vani&s;hed like that of 1770. The di&s;covery of it was announced with boldne&s;s, and held out to the public with confident a&s;&s;urance: But in vain does a candid and impartial Man endeavour to pur&s;ue the traces of it; they elude the &s;earch even of tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to detect and expo&s;e them. It was fortunate for the Tribunal, that, as they &s;ay them&s;elves, They <HI>followed no general rules, and were guided by no legal principles.</HI> This acknowledgement is perfectly new in the annals of ju&s;tice, and ren|ders every other defence of their conduct &s;uperfluous.&mdash;It is al&s;o &s;aid, that the bani&s;hed Citizens were attached to Ari&s;tocracy; but Ari&s;to|cracy no longer exi&s;ts, and if it did, opinions are not cognizable by human Tribunals, and, under the reign of Liberty and Equality, ought not to be the &s;ubjects of legal pro&s;ecution. Be&s;ides, if an attachment to Ari&s;tocracy be a crime, it is a crime of which <HI>Rou&s;&s;eau</HI> him&s;elf is guilty; for, in one of his letters, he expre&s;sly &s;ays, <HI>I give a mo&s;t decided preference to Ari&s;tocracy, over every other form of Go|vernment.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>When I look over the li&s;t of Citizens expelled and bani&s;hed their native country, I cannot but think, that the real object of their puni&s;h|ment was to expel and bani&s;h our trade with them, and to remove Geneva it&s;elf to &s;ome foreign country. We have in fact thrown our City into our own lake, from whence &s;ome wi&s;er people than our&s;elves will rai&s;e it. The arti&s;t will naturali&s;e his talents wherever he &s;ettles him&s;elf; new manufactures will compleat the ruin of ours, and the &s;pirit of commercial enterpri&s;e, before which all difficulties vani&s;h, will turn the channels, which have hitherto brought wealth and plenty to Geneva, into the adopted Countries of our unfortunate Exiles.</Q></P>
<P>Since this pamphlet, &s;everal publications, of a &s;till holder nature, have appeared; from one of which, called <HI>Open your Eyes,</HI> an extract will not be unacceptable to the reader.</P>
<P><Q>Tell us, ye creatures of Rober&s;pierre, you who vi&s;ited him in Paris, and corre&s;ponded with his accomplices&mdash;tho&s;e &s;even of you in parti|cular, who &s;ecretly plotted the in&s;urrection of the 18th of July&mdash;tell me&mdash;by what authority did you pre&s;ume to decide on the fate of your Country? Where are the con&s;piracies, the plots, to which I lent a credulous ear, and which you &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to bring immediately to light? The People is impatient to have &s;ome account of them,&mdash;that People whom you have led from error to error, and crime to crime, and now leave, a prey to the con&s;equences of their folly, and the agonies of their remor&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And you, Bou&s;quet, &amp;c. &amp;c. do you not &s;ee the avenging Furies, waving their horrid torches around you?&mdash;Do you not &s;ee the rivers of blood you have &s;hed? In vain would you wa&s;h out the deep &s;tains of innocent blood, in which you have imbrued your hands. In &s;pite of all your endeavours, they &s;till appear on them. In vain do you hope to e&s;cape the puni&s;hment due to your crimes; your &s;entence is already pronounced, and you may read it in the eyes of all around you,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The effect of the&s;e pamphlets has already been to procure either the rever&s;al, or the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of &s;everal of the &s;entences pa&s;&s;ed by the Revo|lutionary Tribunal. This change of circum&s;tances has not e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation of the Con&s;titutional Government, and has induced them to make an effort, though perhaps an ineffectual one, to &s;upport a &s;y&s;tem, which on a former occa&s;ion they di&s;avowed.</P>
<P>By a proclamation i&s;&s;ued on the 5th of December, the <HI>Syndies and Council peremptorily forbid the Citizens called Ari&s;tocrats and Indifferents, as well as tho&s;e called Mountaineers, to form them&s;elves again into Clubs or Societies, and in&s;i&s;t that, in order to pre&s;erve public tranquillity and &s;ecurity, &s;uch citizens as are de&s;irous of giving their &s;entiments to the public, will not abu&s;e the liberty of the pre&s;s, to &s;pread di&s;content, and inflame the &s;pirit of di&s;cord, by declaiming on the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;toring harmony, confi|dence and union, under pain of &s;uch puni&s;hment, as &s;uch offences de&s;erve.</HI></P>
<P>It is plain from the&s;e circum&s;tances that the &s;pirit of the Revolution is nearly extinct. But how &s;hall we remove what it has introduced, or re&s;tore what it has de&s;troyed?</P></NOTE> and
<PB N="72" REF="033927_0040_0FF9CD4A91ECD630">avow their di&s;content and di&s;appointment in the mo&s;t open manner. To appea&s;e them, and to divert their attention, an
<PB N="73" REF="033927_0040_0FF9CD4A91ECD630">Extraordinary Commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued, to enquire into and puni&s;h all applications of any part of the public plun|der, to the u&s;e of particular individuals. But though this mea&s;ure profe&s;&s;ed to fall on petty delinquents only; yet every man of reflexion &s;aw at once that it was a farce; nor have the Commi&s;&s;ioners yet dared to enter upon their offices, the principal criminals being afraid of &s;etting &s;o dangerous a precedent; and, on that account, determined to let &s;maller crimes go unpuni&s;hed, however notorious.</P>
<P>Neither this partiality, nor the cau&s;e of it, have e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation of the Revolutioni&s;ts. They complain of it in terms of the &s;tronge&s;t indignation. But an event has taken place much more alarming to the leaders, who, thinking that they had excluded all per&s;ons not of their party from the General A&s;&s;embly, ventured, at la&s;t, to call it together for the purpo&s;e of electing a public Trea&s;urer. The members, &s;hocked at the enormous wa&s;te made in the finances, &s;ince the Revolution, recho&s;e the former Trea&s;urer, who was one of the Magi&s;trates depo&s;ed in 1792. To the great mortification as well as a&s;toni&s;hment of the Demagogues, he had at lea&s;t 500 votes more than any other candidate; but he thought it prudent to decline &s;o dangerous a preference. The Election of this Gentleman was the effect of an apprehen&s;ion generally entertained by the Revolutioni&s;ts, and expre&s;sly &s;tated in a pamphlet publi&s;hed by one of them, that the leaders meant to make their retreat with the whole of the plunder. <HI>Let us take care,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>not to entru&s;t the management of our finances, of our la&s;t, our only re&s;ource, to &s;uch impure and blood|thir&s;ty men. Let us, as we tender the very exi&s;tence of our
<PB N="74" REF="033927_0041_0FF9FD17F265AC20">Country, watch with unremitted vigilance, over the&s;e men of blood, the&s;e bankrupts in character, as well as in fortune, and to prevent them, if po&s;&s;ible, from adding the wor&s;t of &s;acrileges to the lift of their other enormities.</HI></P>
<P>From this manner of treating their chiefs, it is plain that a very con&s;iderable number of the Revolutioni&s;ts would gladly &s;acrifice the more violent of their accomplices, and lay upon their heads the puni&s;hment due to their own of|fences. The demagogues of cour&s;e are alarmed to find that the Members of the General A&s;&s;embly, whom they thought prepared to go any lengths with them, &s;hould take advantage of the mode of voting by ballot, to de&s;ert the principles they avow in the Clubs, and to give &s;o con|vincing though indirect a proof, of their aver&s;ion to the Revolution.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this &s;cene of tyranny and deva&s;tation, the unfortunate victims flattered them&s;elves that the new French Re&s;ident, when he pre&s;ented his credentials, would take that opportunity of recommending to the imitation of Geneva, the &s;y&s;tem of moderation, at pre&s;ent adopted by the Convention; and that the influence of France, which had been &s;o often and &s;o fatally exerted again&s;t them, would for once be employed in their favour: but he con|tented him&s;elf with coldly cen&s;uring the conduct of his pre|dece&s;&s;or, and a&s;&s;uring them, that "as France will never permit other nations to interfere in its dome&s;tic concerns, &s;o would it &s;crupulou&s;ly ab&s;tain from intermeddling in tho&s;e of other nations, particularly in tho&s;e of an indepen|dent ally."</P>
<P>What an abominable mixture of cruelty, hypocri&s;y, and irony, on the part of a Nation, which, after openly violating every law, divine and human, and exerting all her &s;trength to plunge us into an aby&s;s of mi&s;ery, of which modern Hi&s;tory affords no other example, has waited for the la&s;t &s;truggles of the expiring victim, to tell it with contemptuous cold|ne&s;s, that &s;he can only be a&s;pectator of its di&s;tre&s;s, and is re&s;trained by the <HI>law of Nations</HI> from interfering with more than her wi&s;hes; though, at the &s;ame time, &s;he re|fu&s;es to give us &s;o &s;light a proof of the exi&s;tence of even
<PB N="75" REF="033927_0041_0FF9FD17F265AC20">tho&s;e wi&s;hes, a recommendation of her own boa&s;ted mode|ration would afford?</P>
<P>To make the cruelty of &s;uch conduct &s;till more poig|nant, and perhaps to dimini&s;h the abhorrence which their own barbarities have excited, by giving the imitation of them an air of ridicule, the <HI>French</HI> have lately thrown the Revolution of Geneva into the &s;hape of a Farce, and exhibited it on one of the Paris Theatres! The Revo|lutionary Tribunal was repre&s;ented exactly in the man|ner de&s;cribed in page 26&mdash;with every additional circum|&s;tance that the ingenuity of malignant &s;corn could &s;ug|ge&s;t, to heighten the effect.</P>
<P>Such is the manner in which <HI>France</HI> has completed her dete&s;table work, in the &s;mall, but once mo&s;t intere&s;ting Republic of <HI>Geneva!</HI> and &s;uch is the return of applau&s;e, of gratitude, and of <HI>fraternization,</HI> which &s;he re&s;erves for future converts to her &s;y&s;tem! May the dreadful le&s;&s;on produce its due effect! and for the &s;ake of human happine&s;s, may the fate of one victim be &s;ufficient to atone for the offence of tho&s;e who &s;till li&s;ten to her doctrines, and in &s;pite of experience wi&s;h to adopt her principles, and imitate her conduct!</P>

<P>The la&s;t letters from Geneva, written about the middle of February, announce, that this unhappy City is &s;till at the di&s;cretion of its oppre&s;&s;ors, who, however, from &s;everal circum&s;tances, now &s;eem to be more and more apprehen&s;ive of the puni&s;hment ju&s;tly due to their crimes. It is &s;aid, that Bou&s;quet and his accomplices have already proceeded to im|pute to each other the perpetration of them; and that, not daring to &s;hew them&s;elves in the day-time for fear of being publicly in&s;ulted, they try, however, to keep up the &s;pirits of &s;uch of their adherents, as they find to be fluctuating, by a&s;&s;uring them, that in France the &s;y&s;tem of terror, and the Jacobins, will &s;oon be re&s;tored, as the only means by which that Republic can be maintained.</P>
<P>Mean time, the Revolutioni&s;ts of Geneva who are the lea&s;t corrupted in their principles, appear by degrees to attach them&s;elves to the few hone&s;t men, who &s;till have the courage not to de&s;pair entirely, although they want the &s;pirit and vigour of mind, nece&s;&s;ary for &s;haking off the
<PB N="76" REF="033927_0042_0FF9FD288B2C4290">yoke under which they groan: but hitherto, nothing has taken place, except a mixture of half-&s;tifled remor&s;e, laudable but ineffectual good wi&s;hes, and weak and ill-directed efforts, the care of carrying which into effect, they leave to Providence. In a word, the la&s;t Revolution of France has put a &s;top to that of Geneva, but hitherto has by no means given it any retrograde motion.</P>
<P>Thus the cen&s;ure which the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Rober&s;pierre &s;eemed to throw upon the la&s;t Revolution of Geneva, appears, at pre&s;ent, to have been only an additional &s;nare laid for the credulity of tho&s;e who have been, and &s;till are, the victims of it. They flattered them&s;elves that the new Committees of Paris, fully appri&s;ed of the many and great evils, which their Republic had occa&s;ioned to ours, would readily have addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome remon&s;trance on the &s;ubject to the Geneve&s;e Jacobins, which could not have failed to produce an in&s;tantaneous effect; the more &s;o, as it was certainly expected by the Geneve&s;e, and, until now, has con|tributed to keep them in a &s;tate of inaction. But far from &s;uch Re|mon&s;trance having ever been &s;ent by the Committees of Paris, as &s;oon as they heard that the Re&s;ident <HI>Adet,</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;or of <HI>Soulavie,</HI> appeared mo&s;t deeply to deplore the work of his predece&s;&s;or, and that his re&s;ent|ment, which he took no pains to hide, had begun to in&s;pire the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;ufferers with a glimp&s;e of hope, they recalled him to Paris, under the pretence of &s;ending him Amba&s;&s;ador to America.</P>
<P>From thence one might conclude that the French Mi&s;&s;ion to Geneva is now calculated as a preliminary &s;tep to that of the United States. May the &s;trength of their Government, our experience, and the pru|dence of their people, pre&s;erve them from reaping the bitter fruits that we have!...</P>
