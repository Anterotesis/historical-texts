<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE following letters were written la&s;t &s;um|mer, immediately after the adoption of the article ex|planatory of the Briti&s;h Treaty. As the &s;ubject of our French relations is now before the public, it has been deemed proper to pre&s;ent them in the form of a pamphlet, as they may enable the citizens of the Uni|ted States to make a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the conduct of the Federal Executive. The explanatory article to the Briti&s;h Treaty has been introduced into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion to &s;hew to what lengths the admini&s;tration has gone to conciliate the Briti&s;h government, and to &s;hew likewi&s;e, that all hazards were to be en|countered and all intere&s;ts pro&s;trated to render our country &s;ub&s;ervient to Great Britain.</P>
<P>As an attempt has been ju&s;t made by the admi|ni&s;tration to ju&s;tify their conduct, to criminate the French Republic, and to alienate the American af|fections from their friends and allies, it is peculiar|ly nece&s;&s;ary, that an antidote &s;hould be applied to the circulating poi&s;on&mdash;this antidote may be found in the&s;e letters; for whatever may be their demerit, it will be be&s;towing little commendation on them to
<PB N="iv" REF="032172_0003_0FF1684A98893448">&s;ay, that they contain a full refutation of the fal&s;e|hoods, calumnies and perver&s;ions, which <Q>the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or in form to the deliberative talents of his predece&s;&s;ors</Q> has attempted to impo&s;e upon the American world. Indeed a refutation of that deformed ma&s;s of unfledged matter would be be&s;tow|ing on it a con&s;ideration it illy merited, were it not accompanied by an authority, which too often, unhap|pily for our country! has legitimized inju&s;tice, and given a &s;anction to the perver&s;ion of truth.</P>
<P>A di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate and unprejudiced con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject of our French relations &s;eems to be all that is reque&s;ted by the author; for it is a con&s;ider|ation of this &s;ort which mu&s;t have given ri&s;e to the impre&s;&s;ions on his mind, and an enquiry, un&s;ophi&s;|ticated by party &s;pirit, and uninfluenced by names, mu&s;t give birth to &s;imilar impre&s;&s;ions on the minds of the reader. It is high time that truth &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tituted for authority; for if the de&s;igns of the admini&s;tration are carried into effect, we may exclaim with the poet:</P>
<Q>"Cur&s;e on his virtues! theyve undone his country."</Q>
<P>The letter of "The Pre&s;idents man Timothy" has di&s;covered the cloven foot of the Briti&s;h faction; and although to avoid a <HI>war</HI> was the argument in favour of the adoption of the Briti&s;h Treaty, yet now the controver&s;y is with the French Republic, every means which malice can devi&s;e, and indeli|cacy can &s;ugge&s;t, are employed to effect a rupture with her. Diplomatic hi&s;tory is without an example of &s;o &s;trange a proceeding as the publication of the Secre|tary
<PB N="v" REF="032172_0004_0FF1684E84283580">of States letter, before its receipt by the Mini&s;ter to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed, and from its extraordinary matter as well as manner; from its mixture of levity with an attempt at wit, when a &s;olemn &s;ubject was in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and being de&s;titute of even a conci|liatory idea or &s;oothing expre&s;&s;ion, no doubt can be entertained, that the object is to prepare us for a war with France, and to provoke her to a declaration of it. The American mind mu&s;t be pro&s;tituted indeed, if it could be &s;o far e&s;tranged from the obligations of gratitude and the prin|ciples of their revolution, as to coincide with the admini&s;tration in the ba&s;e attempt to couple our country with the league of de&s;pots. Let them in|dulge their &s;ympathy for the cau&s;e of kings in &s;ecret, but let them forbear to throw the gauntlet&mdash;let them pau&s;e before they pa&s;s the Rubicon; for the Ame|ricans have not yet been trained to pa&s;&s;ive obe|dience, they have not yet &s;ub&s;tituted the principles of a Machiavelian admini&s;tration for their own; neither have they been &s;ufficiently deba&s;ed to embrace Great Britain and brandi&s;h the dagger at their friends and allies&mdash;They have con&s;tituted a govern|ment not blindly to &s;ubmit to its will; for as they have retained the &s;overeignty in them&s;elves, they will neither pro&s;trate the principles of immutable ju&s;tice, nor the divine attribute of rea&s;on to become the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive tools of creatures of their own creation&mdash; As <HI>"we the people"</HI> con&s;tituted the government, and as we the people can annihilate it, let not the &s;lavi&s;h, the unworthy doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience be any longer preached up by the minions of a Bri|ti&s;h faction to prevent the people from an exerci&s;e
<PB N="vi" REF="032172_0005_0FF1685022508BC0">of their own judgment, and to prevent them from te&s;ting the conduct of their &s;ervants by the eternal principles of ju&s;tice&mdash;If the admini&s;tration has acted ju&s;tly the people will approve, if they have acted unju&s;tly they will condemn&mdash;they will never partici|pate in crimes by becoming their advocates, as long as republicani&s;m &s;hall retain its empire in our country.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the duty of every citizen to contribute all in his power towards the information of the public mind, or the general good. This obligation is &s;o impe|rious, that no man can evade it, without meriting the character of a luke-warm patriot, or of an enemy to the public happine&s;s. As far as my powers go they &s;hall be exerci&s;ed on tho&s;e two objects, and that too with the fulle&s;t determination to permit neither char|acter nor &s;tation to draw me a&s;ide from a candid &s;tate|ment of facts, and as candid a deduction from them.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titution of the United States ought to be to the people of this country what the Alcoran is to the Mahometans&mdash;It is to politics what that is to religion, and ought to be as &s;acred to the one, as that is to the other. The expo&s;ition of its text ought to be uniform, at lea&s;t when interpreted by the <HI>&s;ame</HI> per&s;on.&mdash;A vari|egated con&s;truction of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> part, by the <HI>&s;ame</HI> per|&s;on at <HI>different</HI> times, cannot but lead us to think it an in&s;trument, contrived for the accomodation of tho&s;e
<PB N="2" REF="032172_0007_0FF168561B6D9370">who admini&s;ter it, rather than of the people. My object in this e&s;&s;ay is to &s;hew, that the Executive has inter|preted the <HI>&s;ame</HI> parts of the Con&s;titution, variou&s;ly at different times; and that he has thereby converted the great charter of our country into a thing of chance, liable to the direction of whim, caprice or de&s;ign.</P>
<P>By the fir&s;t con&s;truction of the treaty making power by the Executive, his power was co-ordinate only, and not omnipotent; but by his la&s;t con&s;truction he has completely ab&s;orbed in him&s;elf, the right of making treaties under all circum&s;tances, and in all their varieties. This a&s;&s;ertion I will illu&s;trate by facts. In the year 1790 or 1791, it was deemed expedient to make &s;ome arrangement with Algiers, for the &s;ecurity of our &s;ea|men, and the protection of our commerce.</P>
<P>As monied engagements were nece&s;&s;arily involved in &s;uch a negociation, the Executive did not think him&s;elf con&s;titutionally authorized to negociate a treaty, in which were contained &s;uch &s;tipulations, without fir&s;t having a re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, communicating &s;uch a power. By his direction the Secretary of State wrote to the chairman of a committee of Congre&s;s, appointed on this &s;ubject, and enclo&s;ed a re&s;olution which he wi&s;hed to be adopted, purporting the a&s;&s;ent of Congre&s;s to &s;uch a negociation. Thus it appears from the <HI>then</HI> con&s;truction of the Con&s;titution by the Executive, that he did not conceive him&s;elf authorized to make monied contracts, without fir&s;t obtaining the a&s;&s;ent of Congre&s;s thereto.&mdash;But in the Treaty, which he negociated with Great Britain, he abandoned this ground, and pledged the United States for the pay|ment of <HI>millions of dollars,</HI> on his own individual autho|rity.</P>
<P>Again, in the Treaty which he negociated with the Creek Indians, he thought the <HI>advice</HI> of the Senate, nece&s;&s;ary before he entered upon the negociation. To
<PB N="3" REF="032172_0008_0FF16858E942ED60">obtain this he went in per&s;on to the Senate, and &s;ub|mitted to them the outlines of a treaty. Objections were made to &s;ome of its parts, and amendments were made before the Senate would give their <HI>advice</HI> in favour of the negociation.&mdash;But in the negociation with Great Britain, the Senate were not even apprized that a Trea|ty was to be made, much le&s;s was their <HI>advice</HI> taken upon the &s;ubject. By the Con&s;titution, the <HI>"advice and con&s;ent"</HI> of the Senate are nece&s;&s;ary to the ma|king of treaties, and it is obvious, that the Executive under&s;tood <HI>advice</HI> to mean a different thing from <HI>con|&s;ent,</HI> when he contemplated a Treaty with the Creek Indians. Thus then there has been a manife&s;t differ|ence in the con&s;truction of the Con&s;titution by the Ex|ecutive in the&s;e two ca&s;es, the <HI>advice</HI> and <HI>con&s;ent</HI> of the Senate having been taken in the one ca&s;e, and their <HI>con&s;ent</HI> only in the other. How are we to under&s;tand this difference of the Executive with him&s;elf? What are we to &s;uppo&s;e of a Con&s;titution, &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch oppo&s;ite con&s;tructions? What &s;ecurity are we to look for in an admini&s;tration, capable of torturing the charter of freemen to mean oppo&s;ite things? What bulwark have the people again&s;t the introduction of ar|bitrary power, when their &s;olemn political covenant can be moulded at will, and according to the views of the Executive?&mdash;The&s;e things require &s;erious con&s;iderati|on; for in vain have we &s;eceded from the arbitrary power of Great Britain, if we are to &s;ub&s;titute the will of an individual for the con&s;titution of our coun|try.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>IT is incumbent on freemen to enquire&mdash;it is e&s;&s;en|tial to their independent exi&s;tence to know how their
<PB N="4" REF="032172_0009_0FF1685BD1C0E048">affairs are admini&s;tered&mdash;without inquiry they cannot be informed, without a knowledge of facts they can|not a&s;certain, whether they are advancing or retrogra|ding in political truth. Subjects and &s;laves &s;hould alone endeavour to bury the poignacy of their conditi|on in ignorance&mdash;citizens, to retain their rank, ought to have the torch of inve&s;tigation ever in a blaze. Every mea&s;ure is a wrong one that is aba&s;hed by &s;cru|tiny; every public &s;ervant gives cau&s;e for &s;u&s;picion, who&s;e conduct cannot bid defiance to the &s;evere&s;t ani|madver&s;ions. Truth cannot &s;uffer from inve&s;tigation; upright character cannot be injured by free inquiry; the moment, therefore, expedients are employed to keep truth at a di&s;tance, or to circumvallate cha|racter by adventitious lines, &s;u&s;picion has food to in|dulge upon, and hone&s;ty cau&s;e for alarm.&mdash;Our go|vernment and its admini&s;trators have had divine qua|lities a&s;cribed to them&mdash;if then their merit is equal to the eulogium of their admirers, nothing I can advance can bring their reputation into que&s;tion; on the con|trary, they mu&s;t derive additional lu&s;tre from the at|tempt to ca&s;t a &s;hade over their virtues, and, there|fore, a conduct like mine ought to be approved, who&s;e endeavours to expo&s;e defects, if un&s;upported, mu&s;t re|coil upon the author, and render merit more illu&s;tri|ous. To know merit, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;earch for it; to be enamoured of it, it is nece&s;&s;ary to know it, how far wrong then are tho&s;e, who condemn the freedom of inquiry into the men and mea&s;ures of our govern|ment. Cen&s;ures upon a free pre&s;s are libels upon truth and virtue, and as the diamond receives fre&s;h lu&s;tre from friction, untainted virtue mu&s;t acquire additi|onal brilliance from the rude&s;t contacts. I will pro|ceed to my &s;ubject, and &s;hew a conduct in the Exe|cutive towards the French Republic, that would en|tangle a man's honour in private life in inextricable dif|ficulty.</P>
<P>When Mr. Genet, the fir&s;t Mini&s;ter under the French Republic, arrived in this city, he communica|ted
<PB N="5" REF="032172_0010_0FF1685D70456818">his powers and his wi&s;hes, and tho&s;e of his govern|ment to our Executive, to enter into a new treaty, <Q><HI>on liberal principles, &s;uch as might &s;trengthen the bonds of good will which unite the two nation.</HI></Q> This friendly propo&s;ition was an&s;wered by the Executive, that <Q><HI>the Senate was in rece&s;s, and that he would meet them as &s;oon as he could do it, by the forms of the con&s;titution,</HI></Q> and thus the propo&s;ition was refu&s;ed, under a pretext, that the forms of the Con&s;titution would not them admit of a negociation.</P>
<P>Let us now enquire how tho&s;e forms operated in a late negociation, when the pre&s;ent Secretary of State was appointed a commi&s;&s;ioner to draught a codicil to the la&s;t will and te&s;tament of American Independence&mdash; the Briti&s;h treaty. Scarcely had the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives decided to make appropriations to carry the Briti&s;h treaty into effect, when a memorial from the Briti&s;h Charge d' Affaires announced to the Executive an interference of exi&s;ting treaties with that con|cluded with Great Britain. Without giving this me|morial time to breathe, and to recover from the fa|tigue, which its ha&s;te occa&s;ioned, the Secretary of State was commi&s;&s;ioned by the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> to enter into a negociation with the Briti&s;h Charge d' Affaires, and to form a Treaty Dictionary, by which all treaties, &s;ub&s;equent to the Briti&s;h treaty, were to be defined, and expounded. The appointment of the Secretary of State to this duty is declared in the commi&s;&s;ion, to be <HI>agreeably to the laws of the United States,</HI> and the law, authorizing the delegation of &s;uch a tru&s;t to the Secretary of State, was pa&s;&s;ed the 27th of July, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty nine. Under a law then, which exi&s;ted before the Republic of France had a being, was the pre&s;ent Secretary of State appointed to negociate with a Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, and yet when the mini&s;ter of the <HI>French Republic</HI> pro|po&s;ed a negociation on the 23d of May, 1793, he was informed by the Executive, "That the participation in
<PB N="6" REF="032172_0011_0FF1686172BA82E0">matters of treaty, given by the con&s;titution to that branch of our government, would of cour&s;e delay any definitive an&s;wer to his friendly propo&s;ition," and that he would, <Q>meet them with the mo&s;t friendly di&s;po&s;itions on the grounds of treaty, propo&s;ed by the National Convention, as &s;oon as he could do it by the forms of the Con&s;titution.</Q> The Senate was in rece&s;s, to be &s;ure, when Mr. Genet made the pro|po&s;ition, and they might as well have been in rece&s;s, when the new treaty was negociated between Phineas Bond and Timothy Pickering; for they were not ap|prized of the negociation, until the article was com|pleted and &s;ent to them to be regi&s;tered.</P>
<P>One of two inferences obtrude them&s;elves involun|tarily upon the mind from the foregoing facts&mdash;either that the Pre&s;ident conceived he had not a power to en|ter into a negociation, without the advice of the Se|nate, and, therefore, that he was guilty of a wilful vi|olation of the Con&s;tiution in the negociation of the new explanatory article; or, that the exi&s;ting laws gave him &s;uch an authority, and, therefore, that he was guilty of a violation of his own and the faith of the United States, in declaring to Mr. Genet, the mi|ni&s;ter of the French Republic, that he had no power, by the forms of the Con&s;titution to enter into a negoci|ation with him, as the Senate was in rece&s;s.</P>
<P>We have heard much, lately, about public faith; but what kind of faith is it, which impelled the fir&s;t Executive Magi&s;trate to declare to the French mini&s;|ter, that the forms of the Con&s;titution prohibited trea|ting with him, and yet under the &s;ame forms negoci|ated a treaty with a Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioner? The nerves of certain gentlemen, who were &s;taunch advo|cates for high toned Executive power, were tremu|lou&s;ly alive when the faith of the United States, &s;up|po&s;ed to be pledged by the Executive, was in danger of inexecution as to the Briti&s;h Treaty; but how &s;tands
<PB N="7" REF="032172_0012_0FF168643A81FB48">the account of honor &s;ince the la&s;t negociation? If it is a ju&s;t maxim, that nothing can be politically right which is morally wrong, in what &s;y&s;tem of political morality are we to &s;earch for an extenuation of a breach of faith with one nation more than another? I will leave to ca&s;ui&s;ts to determine the degree of turpitude in deception and fal&s;ehood to a friend, and in abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to a perfidious and tyrannical enemy.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>IN my la&s;t letter I purpo&s;ely avoided con&s;idering the probable effects of our <HI>punic</HI> faith to France. It was not my intention to anticipate the conclu&s;ions which would naturally ari&s;e in every hone&s;t mind. The facts &s;tated mu&s;t bring a blu&s;h into the cheek of every Ame|rican, who feels for his country's honor, and who has not forgotten, that France engaged in a war again&s;t Great Britain to aid us in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our in|dependence, and that &s;he is now at war with the &s;ame nation, who headed the cru&s;ade again&s;t her, to e&s;tabli&s;h her own and the rights of man. The &s;uffu&s;ion of vir|tuous &s;en&s;ibility mu&s;t be increa&s;ed by the information, that Mr. Fauchet, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Mr. Genet, re|newed the propo&s;ition to treat, and that he never received a po&s;itive an&s;wer to his reque&s;t.&mdash;When our Executive had refu&s;ed treating with Mr. Genet, under the pretext already &s;tated, Mr. Morris, our Mini&s;ter at the Republic of France, was de&s;ired <HI>"to explain to the Executive of France this delay, which had prevented, as yet, our formal acce&s;&s;ion to their propo&s;ition to treat; and to a&s;&s;ure them, that the Pre&s;ident would meet them with the mo&s;t friendly di&s;po&s;itions on the grounds of trea|ty, propo&s;ed by the National Convention, as &s;oon as he could do it by the forms of the Con&s;titution,"</HI> and to re|que&s;t,
<PB N="8" REF="032172_0013_0FF16865DC2B0770"><HI>"that the powers of Mr. Genet be renewed to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or."</HI> The powers of Mr. Genet, were re|newed to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Mr. Fauchet propo&s;ed to treat, but was played off with diplomatic fine&s;&s;e! By what name &s;hall we di&s;tingui&s;h this conduct? In what moral code &s;hall we find an apology for a breach of &s;olemn and plighted faith? Mr. Morris was de&s;ired, to <HI>"a&s;&s;ure"</HI> the Executive of France, that the Pre&s;i|dent would meet them, with the <HI>mo&s;t friendly di&s;po&s;itions</HI> on the grounds of treaty, and yet, when Mr. Fauchet made his overtures he could obtain no po&s;itive an&s;wer &mdash;Does this management comport with the <HI>profe&s;&s;ions</HI> made by cur Government to the Republic of France, through Mr. Monroe? Does it accord with the <HI>won|derful letter</HI> written by the Pre&s;ident to Mr. Adet, on the receipt of the French Flag? Well might Mr. Adet now exclaim in turn, <HI>"Wonderful People!"</HI> when our Government has become a phenomenon of hypocri&s;y and treachery. I could &s;well the black catalogue by adding other in&s;tances of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t deception, but at pre&s;ent I &s;hall content my&s;elf with barely &s;tating, that when Mr. Fauchet expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ions about Mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion, he was informed, that nothing more was intended by it, than <HI>to demand a reparation, for the &s;poliations upon our commerce, and that he had no powers to do any thing, which could militate again&s;t the intere&s;t of France</HI>&mdash;And yet the Briti&s;h treaty, was the offspring of this mi&s;&s;ion!!!</P>
<P>As <HI>fear</HI> has been the operative motive in the admi&s;|&s;ion of the Briti&s;h Treaty, I might here &s;hew cau&s;e for alarm to the <HI>funding order,</HI> and to the <HI>mamalukes</HI> of admini&s;tration by maintaining, that we have given the French Republic a &s;ufficient inducement to treat us with &s;everity&mdash;we have by a Treaty with her ene|my, actually <HI>changed the exi&s;ting &s;tate of things,</HI> and thereby furni&s;hed ample cau&s;e for con&s;idering us as in combination again&s;t her&mdash;we have declared a neutrality, co-incident with the <HI>"modern"</HI> u&s;age of nations, and
<PB N="9" REF="032172_0014_0FF16868CF1E77D8">we have, by &s;ub&s;equent &s;tipulations, abandoned this ground, and left a que&s;tion, decided by the modern law, to be determined after the conclu&s;ion of the pre|&s;ent war&mdash;We have increa&s;ed the number of contra|band articles, contrary to the &s;ame modern law, and thereby given evident advantages to Great Britain, at the expence of the French Republic. We have thus violated our neutrality, by <HI>"favouring the arms of one, to the detriment of the other."</HI></P>
<P>"A neutral nation," &s;ays Vattel, "de&s;irous &s;afely to enjoy the conveniencies of that &s;tate, is <HI>in all things</HI> to &s;hew an <HI>exact impartiality</HI> between the par|ties at war; for &s;hould he <HI>favour one, to the detriment of the other,</HI> he cannot complain of being treated by him as an adherent, and confederate of his enemy; his neutrality would be <HI>a fraudulent neutrality,</HI> but of which no nation would be the dupe."</P>
<P>Have we &s;hewn an exact impartiality between the parties at war? Have we not favoured one to the de|triment of the other? Has not our neutrality been a fraudulent one? Have we nor declared, the <HI>"modern u&s;age of nations,"</HI> to be our guide, and have we not abandoned this u&s;age to prejudice France, and to be|nefit Great Britain? Does not the Briti&s;h treaty contain &s;tipulations calculated for the <HI>pre&s;ent war,</HI> and are the&s;e not to be con&s;idered as a deriliction of our neutrality? Did not the Pre&s;ident's <HI>edict</HI> of neutrality declare, that "the duty and the intere&s;t of the Unit|ed States require, that they &s;hould with &s;incerity and good faith, adopt and pur&s;ue a conduct friendly and impartial towards the belligerent powers?" Did we treat France with <HI>"&s;incerity?"</HI> Did we exerci&s;e <HI>"good faith"</HI> towards her?

<P>"WHEREAS by the third article of the treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, concluded at Lon|don on the 19th day of november, 1794, between his Britannic Maje&s;ty and the United States of Ame|rica, it was agreed that it &s;hould at all times be free to his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects and to the Citizens of the United States, and al&s;o to the Indians dwelling on ei|ther &s;ide of the boundary line a&s;&s;igned by the treaty of peace to the United States, freely to pa&s;s and re|pa&s;s by land or inland navigation, into the re&s;pective territories and countries of the two contracting parties on the continent of America (the Bay Company on|ly excepted) and to navigate all the lakes, rivers and waters thereof, and freely to carry on trade and com|merce with each other, &s;ubject to the provi&s;ions and limitations contained in the fir&s;t article: And whereas by the 8th article of the treaty of peace and friend|&s;hip concluded at Greenville on the 3d day of Au|gu&s;t 1795, between the United States, and the nati|ons or tribes of Indians called the Wyandots, Dela|wares, Shawanees, Ottawas, Chippewas, Pattawati|mies, Miamies, Elkias, it was &s;tipulated that no per|&s;on &s;hould be permitted to re&s;ide at any of the towns or hunting camps of the &s;aid Indian tribes as a tra|der, who is not furni&s;hed with a licence for that pur|po&s;e, under the authority of the United States, which latter &s;tipulation has excited doubts, whether in its ope|ration

<P>IN the formation of this article the American Puf|fendorf who negociated it &s;eems to have forgotten that he was not the Secretary of State to Sancho Pan|cha, and that he was not fabricating an explanatory law for the i&s;land of Barataria.

It will be remembered, that Citizen Genet arrived at Charle&s;ton, on the 8th of April 1793&mdash;that the queries were &s;ubmitted to the heads of the departments, on the 18th of the &s;ame month&mdash;that the proclamation of neu|trality was i&s;&s;ued on the 22d, and that the French Mini&s;ter did not arrive in this city, until the 16th of May&mdash;Scarcely had the news arrived in this city, that a Mini&s;ter from the Republic of France had landed at Charle&s;ton, before the queries were manufactured, and tran&s;mitted for con&s;ideration to the different heads of departments&mdash;<HI>Ten</HI> days only intervened between the arrival and the queries, ju&s;t time enough for informa|tion to be received from Charle&s;ton&mdash;<HI>Four</HI> days after the date of the queries, the edict of neutrality was u&s;her|ed into the world, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of every repub|lican in our country. It appears clearly then, that the edict of neutrality was occa&s;ioned by the arrival of Mr. Genet, from its appearing <HI>immediately after</HI> information was received of his arrival at Charle&s;ton. If the ex|ecutive could reconcile him&s;elf to a promulgation of a proclamation of neutrality, under uncon&s;titutional and other circum&s;tances, the other arrangements in the view of the queries followed of cour&s;e. The procla|mation indicated as little regard to the con&s;titution as the queries did to our treaties, and the one was not more perfidious, than the other was an arrogant a&s;&s;ump|tion of power, and the man who could contrive the one could execute the other. The proclamation was the fir&s;t link in the chain, and no doubt the order would have been pur&s;ued, as the &s;econd que&s;tion related to the recognition of the mini&s;ter of the Republic of France, had not an univer&s;al &s;entiment of affectio|nate recognition by <HI>the people,</HI> di&s;played it&s;elf on his pa&s;&s;age through the country from Charle&s;ton to this ci|ty&mdash;Numerous addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented to him, and but one feeling &s;eemed to actuate the American peo|ple. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances it would have made the refu&s;al to acknowledge the Mini&s;ter <Q><HI>a &s;erious bu|&s;ine&s;&s;
<PB N="18" REF="032172_0023_0FF1687E779D51E8">indeed,</HI></Q> and as there was no appearance of <Q><HI>a counter current</HI></Q> at that time, the executive mu&s;t have been reluctantly dragged to obey the voice of the peo|ple&mdash;as a demon&s;trative proof that it was the intention of the executive to pur&s;ue the &s;y&s;tem plainly indi|cated by the queries, the letter of <HI>"Pacificus,"</HI> writ|ten about this time, may be adduced. The&s;e letters were a&s;cribed, and never denied, to the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, the virtual Pre&s;ident of the United States, who&s;e baneful councils directed the affairs of the Union.

<PB N="19" REF="032172_0024_0FF16881609A2D18">whether the treaties between that Republic, and the United States &s;hould be con&s;idered as &s;till in operati|on, and whether a mini&s;ter from the regent of France &s;hould be received&mdash;his intimacy with Talon at that time, who was believed to be a mi&s;&s;ionary of the no|minal regent, made it no doubt a de&s;ideratum with him, that a mini&s;ter from the regent &s;hould be recei|ved.</P>
<P>To remove all doubt about the &s;entiments of the Se|cretary of the Trea&s;ury re&s;pecting the French Repub|lic, I will make a few more quotations from <HI>"Pacifi|cus.

<P><Q>If too (as no &s;en&s;ible and candid man, will deny) the extent of the pre&s;ent combination again&s;t France is in a degree to be a&s;cribed to <HI>imprudences</HI> on her part; <HI>the exemption of the United States in &s;till more manife&s;t and complete.</HI> No country is bound to par|take in hazards of the mo&s;t critical kind, which may have been produced or promoted by the <HI>indi&s;cretion</HI> and <HI>intemperance</HI> of another.</Q> Can repugnance be &s;tronger than that evidenced in the foregoing que&s;tions? Mu&s;t we not be irre&s;i&s;tibly urged to the belief, con|&s;idering the omnipotence of the Secretary in our coun|cils, that the intention was to refu&s;e acknowledging a mini&s;ter from the Republic of France, to renounce the treaties, or hold them &s;u&s;pended until the monar|chy was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, and to recognize a mini&s;ter from the regent? Why the appeal to our ju&s;tice and humanity in favour of the <HI>"unfortunate monarch;"</HI> why that &s;ympathy for the <HI>"&s;on,"</HI> if it was the intenti|on of the Executive to recognize their <HI>"enemies?"</HI> Would the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury have been &s;o em|phatic
<PB N="20" REF="032172_0025_0FF16886946B66D8">in pleading the cau&s;e of Louis and his &s;on, if his feelings had been in uni&s;on with the triumphs of the nation? His cloquence in favor of royalty was too animated, to excite a doubt of his &s;en&s;ibility for its cau&s;e, or his apathy for the Republic. Notwith|&s;tanding the eagerne&s;s he di&s;played during the we&s;tern in&s;urrection to par&s;ue certain innocent men to the gibbet to favour his purpo&s;es, yet when the cau&s;e of <HI>kings</HI> was to plead, he &s;eemed melted by humanity, and the ferocity of his nature appeared to be convert|ed into lamb-like &s;oftne&s;s!! Was the combination again&s;t France owing to her <HI>imprudencies</HI> or to her re|volution? The Secretary here pleads the cau&s;e of <HI>the coalition,</HI> by a&s;cribing the combination again&s;t France to her <HI>imprudencies,</HI> rather than to the revolution. This is in exact coincidence with his views; for if he could make France appear to be the agre&s;&s;or, his purpo&s;es would have been an&s;wered, and the Uni|ted States, in his e&s;timation, mu&s;t have been ab&s;olved from their engagements. If the revolution it&s;elf was an imprudence, or an act of <HI>"indi&s;cretion and intem|perance,"</HI> then indeed have we no honour to look for, for our &s;ece&s;&s;ion from the de&s;poti&s;m of a Briti&s;h mo|narch, and, perhaps, it would not be uncharitable to believe, that the Secretary intended to characterize all revolutions as acts of imprudence, indi&s;cretion and in|temperance. The re&s;i&s;tance of France again&s;t de&s;po|ti&s;m, her energy in oppo&s;ition to the coalition of ty|rants was con&s;idered as imprudence, indi&s;cretion and intemperance, and, therefore, the United States were to <HI>renounce</HI> their treaties with her, or hold them <HI>&s;u&s;pen|ded,</HI> until the government of de&s;poti&s;m &s;hould e&s;ta|bli&s;h, their <HI>"exemption"</HI> being <HI>"manife&s;t and com|plete!!"</HI></P>
<P>If the pre&s;ent Secretary of the Trea&s;ury had made it a problem, whether the treaties between France and the United States ought to be con&s;idered as &s;till in operation, I could have found an apology for him, in the limitation of his mind to the arithmetical rules
<PB N="21" REF="032172_0026_0FF1688834D41FC8">of addition and multiplication; and had the pre&s;ent Secretary of State laboured under the &s;ame difficulty, an ample excu&s;e might have been found for him, as he is <HI>"the &s;ucce&s;&s;or but in forms to his predece&s;&s;ors;"</HI> but that the ex-Secretary of the Trea&s;ury &s;hould have &s;ug|ge&s;ted difficulties, who &s;eems to have made all writers his &s;tudy, from <HI>Machiavel</HI> to Vattel, can only find a &s;olution in his known aver&s;ion from the Republic of France, and devotion to monarchy. Vattel and Burla|maqui are books as familiar to him as Machiavel, and although he has the latter in his <HI>heart,</HI> he has the for|mer in his head, and can quote them, as the devil does &s;cripture, for his purpo&s;es. The&s;e writers and others of like de&s;cription, mu&s;t have taught him, that the treaties between France and the United States are <HI>real</HI> and not <HI>per&s;onal,</HI> and that notwith&s;tanding the change in the form of government, the treaties continued in full force. To make it a que&s;tion then, whether the treaties were to be con&s;idered as &s;till in operation, was implying a de&s;ire to &s;et them a&s;ide, which would doubt|le&s;s have been attempted, if all things had con&s;pired to render &s;uch a breach of faith &s;afe.</P>

<Q><P>Public Treaties, &s;ays Burlamaqui, are al&s;o divi|ded into <HI>real</HI> and <HI>per&s;onal.</HI>&mdash;The latter are tho&s;e made with a prince, purely in regard to his per&s;on and expire with him.

<P>To know which of the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es every treaty belongs to, the following rules may be laid down.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="032172_0029_0FF16892B0C04920">
We mu&s;t fir&s;t attend to the form and phra&s;e of the treaty; to its clau&s;es, and the views propo&s;ed by the contracting parties.

<P>Though the government &s;hould happen to be changed from a republic into a monarchy, the trea|ty is &s;till in force becau&s;e the body is &s;till the &s;ame, and has only another chief.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that as after the change of de|mocracy into a monarchy, the treaty is &s;till in force, in regard to the new &s;overeign; &s;o <HI>if the government, from a monarchy, becomes a republic, the treaty made with the King does not expire, unle&s;s it was manife&s;tly per&s;onal.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Let us now enquire whether the treaties between France and the United States are <HI>real</HI> or <HI>per&s;onal,</HI> and whether we had a right to make a que&s;tion to <HI>"re|nounce"</HI> or hold them <HI>"&s;u&s;pended" until the re&s;torati|on of the monarchy.</HI> In the 11th article of the Trea|ty of Alliance we find the following words: "The two parties guarantee mutually from the pre&s;ent time and <HI>for over</HI> again&s;t all other powers" &amp;c. And in the fir&s;t article of the Treaty of Amity, and Commerce, we have the following words : "There &s;hall be a firm, inviolable and univer&s;al peace, and a true and &s;incere friend&s;hip between the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, <HI>his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors,</HI> and the Uni|ted States of America.

<P>The Treaties then between France and the United States being <HI>public</HI> Treaties, having been made for the good of the two nations, and having been made with the king, for him&s;elf and <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ors for ever,</HI> and the terms in them being declared <HI>perpetual,</HI> it follows evi|dently, that the treaties are <HI>real,</HI> and therefore in com|plete operation, notwith&s;tanding the change in the go|vernment from a monarchy to a republic, and that a que&s;tion to <HI>renounce</HI> them or hold them <HI>&s;u&s;pended</HI> mu&s;t have been dictated by ignorance or depravity.</P>
<P>My conclu&s;ions on this &s;ubject are already drawn; but the people of the United States will decide, whe|ther <HI>ignorance</HI> or <HI>perfidy</HI> originated a &s;et of queries, which go to the de&s;truction of our national faith, and to di&s;&s;olve the ties between the United States and their be&s;t friend; a friend without who&s;e aid the Pre&s;ident's fame and power might have terminated in the ignomi|nious fate of a rebel. Was it honour&mdash;was it gratitude &mdash;was it a love of liberty&mdash;was it a &s;ympathy for hu|man happine&s;s which gave birth to the queries? Au|thority, and that too from an author, which the Secre|tary him&s;elf, in his character of "Pacificus," calls "one of the be&s;t writers on the laws of nations," has &s;tamped an unque&s;tionable <HI>reality</HI> upon our treaties with France; how then the Pre&s;ident could conjure up the difficulties contained in the queries, remains with him to explain.

For &s;o je&s;uiti|cal is the complexion of the queries, that they look as if they had i&s;&s;ued from an apartment of <HI>St. Omers</HI>&mdash; Anatomi&s;ts tell us of Hermaphrodites: but never yet was an <HI>Hermaphrodite war</HI> conceived, unle&s;s in the council chamber of the Pre&s;ident of the United States&mdash;<HI>Machiavel</HI> may contain the ingredients of &s;uch a com|po&s;ition, and &s;o may "Pacificus;" but excepting among tho&s;e two kindred &s;pirits and their di&s;ciples, a war without a gender would be deemed as much a phoenomenon, as "Pacificus" without vice. Que&s;tions
<PB N="27" REF="032172_0032_0FF16897964B2358">of this &s;ort mean more than they expre&s;s; they are like a vane which &s;hews the direction of the wind, and I do not he&s;itate to affirm from their ca&s;t, that our Treaties with France would have been pat in durance, had not the voice of the people &s;ilenced the whi&s;pers of the <HI>Executive conclave.</HI></P>
<P>"Pacificus" calls Vattel "the be&s;t writer on the laws of nations," and no doubt the manufacturer of the queries mu&s;t have known, that Vattel &s;ays, <HI>"war is either offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive;"</HI> in his whole work he has not a &s;yllable about <HI>equivocal</HI> war. Can the author of the queries be of the <HI>epicene</HI> gender him&s;elf, that he has made war an anomaly? As "the be&s;t writer on the laws of nations," knows no &s;uch thing as an <HI>equivocal</HI> war, and as a di&s;tinction which he does not recognize is re&s;orted to by the Executive, it mu&s;t be evident, that this &s;ub&s;titution of his own opinion for the law of nations mu&s;t have been advanced to render abortive the Treaties between France and the United States. The <HI>bull</HI> of neutrality verifies this conclu&s;ion; for it was predicated on the idea, that the treaties de|pended on the Executive fiat.</P>
<P>And here the a&s;&s;umption of the Executive to <HI>inter|pret</HI> treaties <HI>at his plea&s;ure,</HI> might call our attention&mdash;The proclamation of neutrality pre-determined our re|lations with France, previou&s;ly to the arrival of the mini&s;ter of the Republic in this city; and although we had a Treaty of Alliance with France, and her mini&s;ter ought to have been a party to the interpretation, yet in defiance of the po&s;itive law of nations on this &s;ubject, did the Executive undertake to impo&s;e his own in|terpretation. I have on another occa&s;ion cited Vattel; but I will again bring his opinion into view, that no doubt may remain of the truth of my a&s;&s;ertion&mdash;"The third general maxim, or principle, on the &s;ubject of interpretation is: <HI>that neither the one nor the other of the intere&s;ted, or contracting powers has a right to inter|pret
<PB N="28" REF="032172_0033_0FF1689B86B61808">the act or treats at his plea&s;ure;</HI> for if you are at liberty to give my promi&s;e whatever &s;en&s;e you plea&s;e, you will have the power of obliging me to do whatever you have a mind, contrary to my intention, and beyond my real engagement: and reciprocally, if I am allowed to explain my promi&s;es as I plea&s;e, I may render them vain and illu&s;ive, by giving them a &s;en&s;e quite different from that in which they were pre&s;ented to you, and in which you mu&s;t have taken them in accepting them."</P>
<P>That the proclamation of neutrality was itnended as an interpretation of the Treaties, is not only obvious from the in&s;trument it&s;elf; but it is confirmed by the opinions of Secretary Pacificus&mdash;"It has however been admitted, &s;ays this cormorant of monarchy, that the declaration of neutrality <HI>excludes the idea of the clau&s;e of guarantee."</HI>&mdash;If the laws of nations are the rules by which governments mea&s;ure the ju&s;tice or in|ju&s;tice of things, what would be the verdict of the world &s;hould the Executive be tried by the text already quoted? He interpreted a &s;olemn covenant between two nations, <HI>"at his plea&s;ure,"</HI> and in contradiction of a &s;tipulation, that, to &s;ay no more, admitted of doubt, did he declare the United States to be in a &s;tate of neutrality, to the exclu&s;ion of the clau&s;e of guarantee!! By a&s;&s;uming to him&s;elf the authority to interpret the treaties between France and the United States, <HI>at bis plea&s;ure,</HI> the Pre&s;ident has viclated tho&s;e treaties, and has done France an injury. "As the engagements of a treaty, &s;ays Vattel, impo&s;e on the one hand a perfect obligation, they produce on the other a per|fect right. <HI>To violate</HI> a treaty, is then to violate the perfect right of him with whom we have con|tracted, and this is to do him <HI>an injury.</HI>" How our neutrality has been ob&s;erved, has been already glanced at; but how France will view it, begins now to mani|fe&s;t it&s;elf.&mdash;If her forbearance could continue longer, &s;he mu&s;t be more than mortal.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="032172_0034_0FF1689F9110D9C8">
Admitting the doctrines of the Secretary, as held forth in the letters of "Pacificus," and taking for granted, what remains to be proved, that our alliance is purely defen&s;ive, I deny the invalidity of the clau&s;e of guarnatee. In my next letter I will prove, that Great Britain made the fir&s;t declaration of war again&s;t France, that &s;o far from having acted with <HI>imprudence,</HI> or <HI>intem|perance,</HI> that France courted the friend&s;hip of Great Bri|tain, and was treated with the utmo&s;t in&s;olence, and that the clau&s;e of guarantee remains in full force, notwith|&s;tanding the affertion of Pacificus in behalf of the ad|mini&s;tration, that "the declaration of neutrality excludes the idea of the clau&s;e of gaurantee."</P>
<P>If the law of nations, as has been &s;hewn, proncunces &s;entence of condemnation upon the Executive, how will the ca&s;e appear <HI>in foro con&s;cientie?</HI> How will the Pre&s;i|dent acquit him&s;elf to his own feelings, (for I take it for granted he has feelings left) in endeavouring to alienate our country from her be&s;t friend? Will his &s;en&s;ations be unmixed with remor&s;e, when he ca&s;ts a retro&s;pective eye on the events of the late Revolution? Can be have forgotten that France was our &s;heet-anchor, that her a&s;&s;i&s;tance brought the Revolution to a &s;peedy and pro&s;pe|rous i&s;&s;ue, to &s;ay no more, and that the "unequalled pro&s;|perity" of which he boa&s;ts, is in a degree owing to her?

<HEAD>LETER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE guarantee in the Treaty of Alliance between France and the United States remains in full force, and is obligatory upon us, the proclamation of neutrality, the declaration of Secretary Pacificus, and the treaty with Great Britain to the contrary notwith&s;tanding. Great Britain was not only the <HI>fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;or,</HI> but &s;he made <HI>a vir|tual declaration of war</HI> again&s;t France, before the formal declaration took place on the part of the Franch Repub|lic. It is <HI>the act</HI> it&s;elf which we are to con&s;ider; for as the practice of the Briti&s;h nation is to make war fir&s;t, and to declare it afterwards, we are to revert to the act it&s;elf to prove that the declaration of war was fir&s;t made by Great Britain. In the treaty of navigation and commerce between Great Britain and France, &s;igned at Ver&s;ailles on the 26th day of September, 1786, is contained a clau&s;e which &s;tipulates, that war &s;hall not be deemed to exi&s;t until the recalling of &s;ending home of the re&s;pective amba&s;&s;adors and mini&s;ters. This clau&s;e is contained in the &s;econd article of that Treaty, a part of which I will recite to prevent all doubts on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="032172_0036_0FF168A2F5554E18">
<Q>Article II. For the further &s;ecurity of commerce and friend&s;hip between the &s;ubjects of their &s;aid maje|&s;ties and to the end that this good corr&s;pondence may be pre&s;erved from all interruption and di&s;turbance, it is concluded and agreed, that if at any time there &s;hould ari&s;e any mi&s;under&s;tanding, breach of friend|&s;hip, <HI>or rupture</HI> between the crowns of their maje&s;ties, which God forbid! <HI>(which rupture &s;ball not be deemed to exi&s;t until the recalling or &s;ending home of the re&s;pective amba&s;&s;adors and mini&s;ters)</HI> the &s;ubjects of each of the two parties, re&s;iding in the dominion of the other, &s;hall have the privilege of remaining and continuing their trade therein, without any manner of di&s;turbance, &s;o long as they behave peaceably, and commit no offence again&s;t the laws and ordinances,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It appears then, from this article, that a rupture was to be deemed to exi&s;t, or that an actual declaration of war was to be inferred from the recalling or &s;ending home the re&s;pective amba&s;&s;adors and mini&s;ters. Facts will now decide the que&s;tion, that Great Britain declared war fir&s;t again&s;t France, and therefore that France is acting on the <HI>defen&s;ive.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately after the depo&s;ition of the King, Lord Gower, the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter at Paris, was recalled by the Briti&s;h court. For a con&s;iderable time after the recall of Lord Gower, Mr. Chauvelin, the French mini&s;ter at the court of London, was continued there by the Execu|tive Council. On the 17th of December 1792, Mr. Chauvelin pre&s;ented a memorial to Lord Grenville, in which he informed him <HI>"that the Executive Council of the French Republic thinking it a duty which they owe to the French nation, not to leave it in the &s;tate of &s;u&s;|pence into which it has been thrown by the late mea&s;ures of the Briti&s;h government, have authorized him to demand with openne&s;s, whether France ought to con&s;ider England as a neutral or ho&s;tile power; at the &s;ame time being &s;oli|citous,
<PB N="32" REF="032172_0037_0FF168A5CC139D20">that not the &s;malle&s;t doubt &s;hould exi&s;t re&s;pecting the di&s;po&s;ition of France towards England, and of its de|&s;ire to remain in peace."</HI> To a memorial, fraught with &s;uch friendly and pacific &s;entiments, Lord Grenville returned the mo&s;t arrogant and in&s;ulting an&s;wer. "He acknowledged the receipt of a <HI>note</HI> from Mr. Chauve|lin, <HI>&s;tyling him&s;elf</HI> mini&s;ter plenipotentiary of France, and informed him, that &s;ince the unhappy events of the 10th Augu&s;t, the king had &s;u&s;pended all <HI>official</HI> communication with France, and that <HI>he could not be treated with in the quality and under form &s;tated in his note."</HI> Notwith&s;tanding the in&s;ulting and irritat|ing conduct di&s;played by the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, <HI>Le Brun</HI> the mini&s;ter of foreign affairs in France, tran&s;mitted a memorial in an&s;wer to Lord Grenville's letter, replete with pacific &s;entiments. He repeated "the a&s;&s;urances of their &s;incere de&s;ire to maintain peace and harmony between France and England, and declared it was with great reluctance that the Republic would &s;ee it&s;elf forced to a rupture <HI>much more contrary to its in|clination</HI> than its intere&s;t." Lord Grenville's reply to this memorial was, if po&s;&s;ible, more in&s;olent and irri|tating than the fir&s;t. He informed Mr. Chauvelin by note, that his maje&s;ty would not receive his new letters of credence from the French Republic. On the 24th of January 1793, the Briti&s;h court di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the French mini&s;ter by a letter from Lord Grenville in the following terms: "I am charged to notify to you, Sir, that the character with which you have been inve&s;ted at this court, and the functions of which have been &s;o long &s;u&s;pended, being now entirely terminated by the fatal death of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, you have no lon|ger any public character here; and his maje&s;ty has thought fit to order that you &s;hould retire from this kingdom within the term of eight days." The Ex|ecutive Council di&s;covered the extreme&s;t &s;olicitude to pre&s;erve peace with Great Britain: for although the in|&s;olent brutality of Lord Grenville was extreme, the Ex|ecutive Council further conde&s;cended to &s;end Mr. Maret
<PB N="33" REF="032172_0038_0FF168AAF94C3298">as a confidential agent, to endeavour to endeavour to conciliate the Briti&s;h court. As Mr. Chauvelin was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed before his arrival he did not feel him&s;elf authori&s;ed to make known his powers; but he announced his arrival to Lord Grenville, who took no notice of him. Thus was the rupture complete by treaty. The declaration of war then being made by Great Britain, <HI>by recalling her amba&s;&s;ador and &s;ending home the mini&s;ter of France,</HI> the Executive Council re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly on the 1&s;t of February, that the Republic of France was at war with the king of Great Britain.</P>
<P>From the foregoing facts who will dare to &s;ay, ex|cepting our admini&s;tration and their minions, that Great Britain did not fir&s;t declare war again&s;t France, and that &s;he did not treat France with the utmo&s;t in&s;olence, arro|gance, and brutality? Did France di&s;cover the <HI>"indi&s;|cretion and intemperance"</HI> which Secretary Paci&s;icus dwells upon with &s;o much rapture? Did &s;he exhibit tho&s;e <HI>"angry and vindictive pa&s;&s;ions,"</HI> that called forth all his pathos in favour of Louis and his &s;on? Her for|bearance was exemplary, and the ultima ratio was in her own defence. The&s;e <HI>"partizans of war and confu&s;ion,"</HI> to &s;peak in Pre&s;idential language, di&s;played a temper and moderation honourable to their cau&s;e and human nature.</P>
<P>Taking Paci&s;icus' a&s;&s;ertion now for granted, that our alliance with France is <HI>defen&s;ive,</HI> I pronounce that the clau&s;e of guarantee is obligatory, Great Britain having declared war fir&s;t according to treaty, and that we are bound to fulfil it, whenever France &s;hall think proper to make the demand.</P>
<P><HI>Public Faith</HI> has been echoed and re-echoed by our admini&s;tration and its minions, while the Briti&s;h Treaty hung in &s;u&s;pence in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, till the reiterated cries almo&s;t produced a belief that <HI>they</HI> imagined it a <HI>&s;ub&s;tance.</HI> The review of their conduct to France however, has demon&s;trated, that with them it

There is not a feature in our public tran&s;actions with France, which has not a perfidious ca&s;t, and were we dipo&s;ed to cite examples of the deepe&s;t hypocri&s;y, and mo&s;t trea|cherous policy, we need not travel without the purvieu of our Executive admini&s;tration.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P><Q>DOES any article in either of the Treaties prevent &s;hips of war other than privateers, of the powers op|po&s;ed to France, from coming into the ports of the United States to act as convoys to their own mer|chantmen? Or does it lay any other re&s;traint upon them more than would apply to the &s;hips of war of France?</Q> The&s;e que&s;tions have been fully an&s;wered in favour of Great Britain by the conduct of the Execu|tive. Was additional evidence nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub&s;tantiate the exi&s;tence of a plan ho&s;tile to the French Republic, the free ingre&s;s and egre&s;s of Briti&s;h &s;hips of war into and from our ports would complete the ma&s;s of te&s;timony. Whenever the &s;ubtlety of con&s;truction, or perhaps more properly mi&s;con&s;truction, could be u&s;ed to injure France and benefit Great Britain, it has been the almo&s;t invari|able re&s;ort of the Executive. A mo&s;t extraordinary and palpable latitude has been given to the &s;hips of war of Great Britain in flagrant violation of expre&s;s and un|equivocal &s;tipulations. By the 17th article of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between France and the United States, it is expre&s;sly declared, that "no &s;helter or refuge &s;hall be given in their ports to &s;uch (&s;peaking of &s;hips of war) as &s;hall have made prize of the &s;ubjects, peo|ple or property of the parties; but if &s;uch &s;hall come in, forced by &s;tre&s;s of weather or danger of
<PB N="35" REF="032172_0040_0FF168AEEAC07540">the &s;ea, all proper means &s;hall be vigorou&s;ly u&s;ed, that they go out and retire from thence as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible." Pacificus him&s;elf with all his talents at riddle and perver&s;ion, would be puzzled to make even a plau|&s;ible defence for the Executive if tried by this article. Several of the &s;hips of war of Great Britain have been con&s;tantly crui&s;ing on our coa&s;t to intercept French pro|perty; they have captured French property to a con&s;i|derable amount, and yet the&s;e &s;ame &s;hips of war have been permitted to enter our ports <HI>ad libitum</HI> unforced by &s;tre&s;s of weather, or danger of the &s;ea! The patron|age which has been thus given them by the Executive, has enabled them to keep their &s;tations on our coa&s;t and more effectually to harra&s;s the commerce of the French Republic. The Thetis, Thi&s;be, Hu&s;&s;ar, Cleopatra and Prevoyante frigates have been perfectly at home in our ports, and have been as much at their ea&s;e as if we had no &s;tipulations to the contrary, and had been colonized anew. His Britannic maje&s;ty's dockyard at Norfolk, would make the pre&s;umption &s;trong, that our Executive, if not the United States, was in <HI>alliance</HI> with the "mag|nanimous" George. Thus has the Executive given <Q><HI>&s;helter and refuge in our ports to &s;uch as have made prize of the people and property</HI></Q> of the French Republic, in open violation of our public faith!</P>
<P>If the people of the United States are in&s;en&s;ible to &s;uch outrages upon our public faith, becau&s;e they are committed by him, who is &s;tyled the "Saviour of his Country," can they expect that France will be the dupe of &s;uch flagrant inju&s;tice? Will <HI>a name</HI> &s;anctify hypocri&s;y and perfidy there? A &s;olitary breach of na|tional faith may have claimed her indulgence, but when the&s;e breaches are multiplied to an aggravated exce&s;s, we cannot expect further forbearance. Injury and in|&s;ult have their limits, and friend&s;hip it&s;elf will re&s;i&s;t when the ultimate point is exceeded; and that our Ex|ecutive has pa&s;&s;ed the ne plus ultra cannot any longer admit of doubt. Our public faith, like Fal&s;taff's honor,
<PB N="36" REF="032172_0041_0FF1683AD995F510">has been an affair of calculation, and like the <HI>fides punica</HI> will &s;oon become proverbial.</P>
<P><HI>"Should the future Regent of France &s;end a mini&s;ter to "the United States, ought he to be received?</HI></P>
<P>Can a que&s;tion of this &s;ort, coming from the Chief Magi&s;trate of the United States, be read without the &s;tronge&s;t emotions of horror and indignation? Mu&s;t we not lament the profound hypocri&s;y or the fall of the man who could conceive &s;uch a propo&s;ition? Had the politics of Pitt found entrance into our councils, that a propo&s;ition to receive a mini&s;ter from the Regent &s;hould have been agitated in both countries nearly at the &s;ame time? A mini&s;ter from the Regent of France! Gra|cious God! that &s;uch an idea &s;hould ever have found its way into an American bo&s;om! While the dread of Briti&s;h &s;hackles had not yet left the memory&mdash;while the hilarity of emancipation &s;till vibrated in our hearts&mdash; while the impre&s;&s;ion of the benefaction of France was yet warm in our bo&s;oms&mdash;while the horror of tyranny appeared to us in its mo&s;t vivid colours, was the dark project conceived of receiving the infernal agent of de&s;|poti&s;m!! Was it WASHINGTON who entertained the thought! He who headed the armies of America to repul&s;e tyranny! He who&s;e command extended over tho&s;e brave Gallic legions, who traver&s;ed the Atlantic to give us freedom! Is this the Apo&s;tle of Liberty&mdash; the Saviour of his Country&mdash;the Benefactor of Mankind! Where was the pretended &s;ympathy for a great and gal|lant nation, &s;truggling for the &s;ame rights which they had contributed to e&s;tabli&s;h! Had power obtunded every philanthropic &s;entiment, every &s;en&s;ation in favour of liberty, that Frenchmen embarked in &s;upport of Hea|ven's be&s;t gift to man, could not awaken a &s;olicitude for their cau&s;e, and a &s;en&s;ibility for their &s;ufferings! A mini&s;ter from the Regent of France!!</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="032172_0042_0FF1687152D16DB8">
Without forcing an interpretation this que&s;tion plainly reads thus: Shall the United States become a member of the confederacy again&s;t the French Republic? To have received a mini&s;ter from the Regent would have been a &s;ignal of ho&s;tility&mdash;it would have unfurled the cru&s;ading banner, and our Executive mu&s;t have taken up the cro&s;s again&s;t liberty in concert with tyrants. No na|tion admitted a repre&s;entative from the Regent but tho&s;e in open ho&s;tility again&s;t to Republic, and I believe no nation made a que&s;tion about it, but tho&s;e who were or wi&s;hed to be of the coalition. When we con&s;ider the <HI>extreme intimacy</HI> which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Secretary Paci|ficus, and Talon, the agent of the Regent, this que&s;tion receives the &s;tamp of greater &s;olemnity, and removes all doubt of the favourable di&s;po&s;ition of the Executive to|wards the government of ba&s;tiles and lettres de cachet.</P>
<P>I have in a former letter demon&s;trated that our Trea|ties with France are <HI>real,</HI> and that notwith&s;tanding the change in the government from a monarchy to a repub|lic, the Treaties between the United States and her are completely obligatory. It cannot now be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cu&s;s the legal impropriety of receiving a mini&s;ter from a wandering Regent, it being a ramification of the &s;ub|ject already con&s;idered; for if the Treaties were not obli|gatory, we had a di&s;cretionary power to receive or refu&s;e a mini&s;ter from the Regent; but if they were, no &s;uch di&s;cretion could exi&s;t; the que&s;tion, therefore, partakes all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, of a higher de|gree of turpitude than any that has pre&s;ented it&s;elf.</P>

<P>The po&s;ture of affairs in Europe, particularly be|tween France and Great Britain, places the United States in a delicate &s;ituation; and requires much con|&s;ideration of the mea&s;ures which will be proper for them to ob&s;erve in the war between tho&s;e powers. With a view to forming a general plan of conduct for the Executive, I have &s;tated and enclo&s;ed &s;undry que&s;ti|ons to be con&s;idered preparatory to a meeting at my hou&s;e to morrow; where I &s;hall expect to &s;ee you at

</LETTER>
<P>Although the &s;ituation of the United States was con|fe&s;&s;edly delicate, and much con&s;ideration was nece&s;&s;ary to the adoption of proper mea&s;ures; and although Con|gre&s;s alone has the right to decide upon mea&s;ures in which are implicated <HI>war,</HI> yet, whatever qualms may have exi&s;ted anterior to the meeting, did the Executive determine, or his council for him, that his fiat &s;hould be &s;upreme, and that his own omni&s;cience was commen&s;u|rate to every object. The&s;e opinions, and the conduct con&s;equent upon them, were the &s;ource of all our misfor|tunes and of all our di&s;tractions. They exhibited in the Chief Magi&s;trate of a free peoble, an u&s;urper, who&s;e arro|gance was not to be re&s;trained by an over-weening fond|ne&s;s for fame, or by the limits of our Con&s;titution. They were the &s;tepping-&s;tone to future mea&s;ures which were to throw our country into the arms of Great Britain, which were to draw the cords of connection between the Execu|tive and his "great, good and dear friend" into a gordian knot and to alienate the freemen of America from <HI>their</HI> be&s;t friend, the Republic of France. The a&s;&s;umption of power in the Executive to act independently of Congre&s;s in things in which their deci&s;ion were con&s;titutionally e&s;&s;ential, was the key-&s;tone in the arch, and bound to|gether the &s;y&s;tem manife&s;ted in the queries. Had Con|gre&s;s been convened, different mea&s;ures might have been adopted. That di&s;graceful act of u&s;urpation, the Edict of Neutrality, might have been prevented, and the neutrality of the United States might have been dig|nified and honourable, in&s;tead of abject and fraudulent. I might &s;ay, and with truth, "that during the &s;ix years" glorious admini&s;tration, we have had a government of individual will indeed of that of the people; for the Ex|ecutive had but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ay, Let there be, and there was&mdash;
<PB N="40" REF="032172_0045_0FF168B4846021E8">Virtually, Congre&s;s have been a committee of ways and means&mdash;a parliament, &s;omewhat after the ancient rigime of Frances to regi&s;ter edicts. Even information as to the affairs of the union, of which as <HI>individuals</HI> they are a part, and as <HI>Republicans</HI> they have a right to de|mand, was denied them. This conduct plainly evinced that the Executive imagined Congre&s;s had no right to deliberate but to act, and that according to the informa|tion <HI>he</HI> &s;hould think proper to give, and the promptitude <HI>he</HI> &s;hould conceive fit to direct. In this in&s;tance his de|portment was analogous to that of Louis 16th to the notables. They refu&s;ed their concurrence to the new ter|ritorial impo&s;t, unle&s;s the accounts and e&s;timates of the government were &s;ubmitted to their in&s;pection. The king refu&s;ed this a-la-mode de Pre&s;ident, and &s;aid, that he was determined to introduce the <HI>impot territorial,</HI> and and that it therefore became them to debate, <HI>not the prin|ciple of the mea&s;ure,</HI> but the mo&s;t equitable form it could a&s;&s;ume. Congre&s;s were to debate not the propriety of carrying the Treaty into effect, but the mo&s;t equitable way of making provi&s;ion for it, the readie&s;t way of giv|ing effect to the Executive <HI>will!</HI> Ignorance was as well adapted to this end as information, and as the Roman pontiff prohibits the &s;heep of his flock from a knowledge of the bible to keep up his infallibility, in like manner was the infallibility of the Executive to be &s;u&s;tained, by my&s;tery and concealment.</P>
<P>Royal as well as papal importance has di&s;played it&s;elf in our Executive tran&s;actions. Proclamations have i&s;&s;u|ed from the "United States" as from a hot bed. We have had a Proclamation of Neutrality, a Proclamation for a day of thank&s;giving (as if we had a <HI>Vatican</HI> and a <HI>Tiara</HI>) and a proclamation declaring a &s;upreme law of the United States before it had pa&s;&s;ed through all the nece&s;&s;ary forms! Thus is the thing taking effect in &s;ub&s;tance which was contemplated in form, and that kind of government meditated by Secretary "Pacificus" in and out of the convention, beginning to be realized.
<PB N="41" REF="032172_0046_0FF168B89FA43458">We are now to have the <HI>"&s;auce to the &s;ame pig"</HI> which the cha&s;te Secretary endeavoured to obtain in the Con|vention; for circum&s;tances will warrant the conclu&s;ion, that the aim is, to a&s;&s;imilate our government to a mo|narchy. Every mea&s;ure &s;eems to &s;quint towards this darling object, and hence <HI>irredeemable debts, exci&s;e &s;y&s;tems, national banks, loans, federal cities, reports for rai&s;ing re|venue by an officer unknown to the Con&s;titution, and depend|ant upon the Executive&mdash;hence the plan to excite the We&s;t|ern In&s;urrection to increa&s;e the national debt, to furni&s;h a pretext for a &s;tanding army, and to &s;upply arguments again&s;t the cau&s;e of republicani&s;m&mdash;hence the pious wi&s;h of the more pious Secretary, in the pre&s;ence of "the Benefactor of Man|kind!" that the in&s;urgents would burn Pitt&s;burgh!</HI></P>
<P>When the que&s;tion to convene Congre&s;s was propo&s;ed, Congre&s;s had been &s;omewhat purged of its dro&s;s. Fewer <HI>bank directors</HI> and <HI>&s;tockjobbers</HI> held &s;eats in that body, and as their intentions with re&s;pect to <HI>high toned government</HI> were rather problematical, hence the determination not to convene them, but to &s;ub&s;titute the will of the Execu|tive for the will of the Repre&s;entatives of the People.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>THE Con&s;titution has &s;olemnly recognized but a &s;in|gle Executive. It has ordered, that Executive re&s;pon|&s;ibility &s;hould be an unit. Were it placed upon a rack, and <HI>"Pacificus"</HI> him&s;elf the torturer, it could not be made to confe&s;s, that the heads of the departments were by it created accompli&s;es in Pre&s;idential deci&s;i|ons. If the Con&s;titution has recognized a Council at all, it is <HI>the Senate:</HI> for certain Executive mea&s;ures are expre&s;sly directed to be acompli&s;hed "by and with the <HI>advice</HI> and con&s;ent of the Senate." In ther enumera|tion
<PB N="42" REF="032172_0047_0FF168BA5903A020">of the powers of the Pre&s;ident, the Con&s;titution &s;ays, "he may require the opinion, <HI>in writing,</HI> of the principle officers in each of the Executive Depart|ment, upon any &s;ubject <HI>relating to the duties of their re&s;pective offices.</HI>" In the laws organizing the Depart|ments of the Governments we find certain duties alot|ted to them: but we cannot di&s;cover any thing like an authority to make the Heads of the Departments an Ex|ecutive Council. But although neither the Con&s;titu|tion, not the laws of the United States acknowledge an <HI>Executive Council,</HI> the Pre&s;ident has thought proper to metamorpho&s;e the Secretaries of State, of the Trea&s;ury and of War, and the Attorney General of the United States into &s;uch a body. He has e&s;tabli&s;hed a rule to commit things <HI>not relating to the duties of their re&s;pective offices</HI> to their advice and deci&s;ion. <HI>Numbers</HI> in this Coun|cil decide the great intere&s;ts of the nation. This <HI>"&s;elf-created"</HI> Council manufacture memorials to foreign nations, &s;peeches to Congre&s;s, and an&s;wers to the peo|ple. They deliberate and decide upon what mea&s;ures are proper for the Executive to pur&s;ue, and thus in many in&s;tances &s;ub&s;titute their own advice to that of the Senate, which is con&s;titutionally authori&s;ed to give advice. Mr. Randolph tells us in his Vindication, that a memorial relative to the Treaty was to be pre&s;ented to the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, and that this memorial was to be &s;ubmitted to the &s;elf-created Council The Pre&s;ident in his letter of the 29th July, tells Mr. Randolph, that "the memo|rial, the ratification, and the in&s;tructions, <HI>which are framing,</HI> are of &s;uch va&s;t magnitude, as not only to require great individual con&s;ideration, but a &s;olemn the ratification, and the in&s;tructions, <HI>which are framing,</HI> are of &s;uch va&s;t magnitude, as not only to require great individual con&s;ideration, but a &s;olemn <HI>conjunct revi&s;ion.</HI>" In his letter of the 18th of July, written at Baltimore, he de&s;ires "that the addre&s;s of the people of Bo&s;ton &s;hould be taken into con&s;idera|tion by <HI>the Secretaries and Attorney General.</HI>" Mr. Randolph mentions, that "they were collected imme|diately upon the receipt of the letter; and <HI>did not at once agree, whether an an&s;wer &s;hould or &s;hould not be returned.</HI>" In reference to the memorial, Mr. Ran|dolph
<PB N="43" REF="032172_0048_0FF168BE475BF110">further &s;ays, "on the evening of the 11th of Au|gu&s;t, I ob&s;erved to him (the Pre&s;ident) in the pre&s;ence of Me&s;&s;rs. Pickering and Bradford, that the &s;ooner the memorial was revi&s;ed by the gentleman <HI>jointly,</HI> who were prepared with their opinions, the better; and he replied, that <HI>be &s;uppo&s;ed every thing of this &s;ort had been &s;ettled.</HI>"</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts it would appear, that the Con&s;titu|tion de&s;igned the Executive Department as a <HI>Puppet Shew,</HI> where the fir&s;t Magi&s;trate was to play <HI>Punch,</HI> and the Heads of the Department the <HI>Jugglers!!!</HI></P>
<P>It is a circum&s;tance not more alarming than extraor|dinary, that a Council to which no re&s;pon&s;ibility is at|tached, &s;hould be created by the Pre&s;ident, where the mo&s;t momentous tran&s;actions of the Executive Depart|ment are determined on by a plurality of voices. In que&s;tions relating to Treaties, this Council decides whe|ther a Treaty &s;hall be made&mdash;thus the advice of <HI>the Se|nate,</HI> con&s;titutionally requi&s;ite, is &s;uperceded by the ad|vice of a Council unknown to our lows or to our Con|&s;titution! We find by the letter which covered the que|ries, that even a que&s;tion which had relation to <HI>war,</HI> was to be decided by this <HI>&s;elf-created</HI> Council. In&s;tead of petitions or memorials to the Pre&s;ident, the people ought in future to make their application to this Coun|cil; for more &s;ucce&s;s has often re&s;ulted from an applica|tion to a Monarchs <HI>Valet de Chambre,</HI> than from an ap|plication to the Monarch him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The king of Great Britain has a Council where Exe|cutive mea&s;ures are determined a little a-la-mode de Pre&s;ident; but this Council is <HI>re&s;pon&s;ible,</HI> and by the Con&s;titution <HI>the king can do no wrong.</HI> Is it the inten|tion of the Executive to &s;hift the re&s;pon&s;ibility attached to his office from him&s;elf to his Council, and thereby to introduce the royal principle, that <HI>he</HI> can do no wrong? A Con&s;titution in the e&s;timation of a quondam Secretary
<PB N="44" REF="032172_0049_0FF168BFE4B3DFC0">being nothing more than <HI>"paper and parchment,"</HI> it may be deemed very ca&s;y to impre&s;s upon this paper and parchment any character he and <HI>his machine</HI> may think proper. Perhaps the attempt may &s;oon be le&s;s covert, and then the people will be convinced that a man may affect a prodigality of patricti&s;m to become the tyrant, in&s;tead of the Saviour of his Country.</P>
<P>When in connection with this mo&s;t extraordinary mode of tran&s;acting the affairs of the Executive Depart|ment, we &s;urvey the characters who give laws to the Uni|on, our feelings are not much relieved; for as the Pre|&s;ident him&s;elf has pronounced them to be but the <HI>"&s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors in form to the deliberative talents of their predece&s;|&s;ors,</HI>" patrioti&s;m cannot &s;uppre&s;s its anxiety, when our deare&s;t intere&s;ts are committed to &s;uch hands. An auk|ward Prothonotary may make a more clum&s;y Secretary of State, and a &s;till more aukward Privy Coun&s;ellor. He may have a <HI>ver&s;atility</HI> of vi&s;ion, by means of which he can &s;ee beauty or deformity in political objects according to the &s;tation he occupies. He may <HI>"throw the ve&s;&s;el of State up into the wind"</HI> through his ignorance of political tactics; but the attributes of a man calculated to govern freemen are neither <HI>folly, hypocri&s;y</HI> nor <HI>phrenzy.</HI></P>
<P>The man who&s;e utmo&s;t range of capacity went no fur|ther than to &s;tate an account, or to tell you that two and two made four, and that twice five made ten, might pa&s;s in a &s;ubordinate &s;tation in the Trea&s;ury: but would it not be viewed as madne&s;s or wickedne&s;s to place &s;uch a man in a &s;ituation where his voice might determine the &s;ate of millions? He might be well qualified to head a hand of Connecticut intruders, <HI>"or friends to order,"</HI> and to tie a &s;orry Prothonotary, or a brawny Sachem by the leg in the woods who would attempt to oppo&s;e him; but would &s;uch qualifications entitle him to the rank of a Privy Coun&s;ellor? Every &s;entiment of ju&s;tice revolts at the idea.</P>

The people of the United States made a Con&s;titution for their government, in which certain duties are pre|&s;cribed to the different departments created by it, and certain boundaries e&s;tabli&s;hed. This Con&s;titution they expected would be admini&s;tered with fidelity, and accord|ing to its true intent and meaning.

Viewed in all its relations this article is as complete a libel upon the American character as the utmo&s;t ingenuity of the admini&s;tration could devi&s;e. It is a climax of weakne&s;s and wicked|ne&s;s. Whether we con&s;ider it in reference to our&s;elves, or to tho&s;e nations with whom we have made treaties&mdash; whether we regard in it the a&s;&s;umption of power in the Executive to act independently of the <HI>advice</HI> of the Se|nate, and making it a mere <HI>regi&s;tering</HI> body, or whe|ther we view it as an emanation from that <HI>&s;elf created</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="032172_0051_0FF168C6BAFBC6F8">Council, which has been &s;ub&s;tituded by an Executive fiat to the legal Council of the nation&mdash;whether we re|gard the Executive and this Council as arrogating to them&s;elves the &s;tile and authority of <HI>Amphyctions,</HI> and interpreting laws for nations, &s;overeign and independent as we are&mdash;whether we con&s;ider the deception practi&s;|ed upon Spain and the Indian tribes by the introducti|on of &s;tipulations into our treaties with them which we could not fulfil, or the pro&s;tration of honour and national character in entering into &s;ub&s;equent &s;tipula|tions which are at war with former ones&mdash;&s;urveying it in all its a&s;pects, it appears de&s;igned, as the apple of Juno, for jealou&s;y and di&s;cord.</P>
<P>I will proceed to the con&s;ideration of that article in the Spani&s;h Treaty, which relates to the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. The explanatory article of the Briti&s;h Treaty either di&s;mi&s;&s;es this article altogether, and by means of it renders abortive the whole Treaty, or it im|po&s;es an obligation upon the United States to render the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi free to the &s;ubjects of Great Britain. Had no explanation of this &s;ort been entered into, it is fair from the article it&s;elf to &s;uppo&s;e, that the United States would not have been under the &s;ame obligation to Great Britain; but as they have expre&s;sly declared <HI>by Treaty,</HI> that no &s;tipulations <HI>in any Treaty</HI> can be un|der&s;tood to interfere with the rights and free intercou&s;e and commerce &s;ecured by the third article of the treaty with Great Britain, the Briti&s;h Treaty then becomes a political decalogue, by which the people of the United States are bound to mea&s;ure their actions.</P>
<P>The fourth article of our treaty with Spain is in the following words:</P>
<P><Q>It is likewi&s;e agreed, that the we&s;tern boundary of the United States which &s;eperates them from the Spani&s;h colony of Loui&s;iana, is in the middle of the channel or bed of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi from the northern
<PB N="47" REF="032172_0052_0FF168C984DA4B58">boundary of the &s;aid &s;tates to the completion of the thir|ty-fir&s;t degree of latitude North of the Equator. And his Catholic Maje&s;ty has likewi&s;e agreed that the navi|gation of the &s;aid river in its whole breadth from its &s;ource to the ocean &s;hall be free only <HI>to his &s;ubjects, and the citizens of the United States,</HI> unle&s;s he &s;hould ex|tend this privilege to the &s;ubjects of other powers by &s;pecial convention.</Q></P>
<P>Let us now compare this article with that part of the third article of the Briti&s;h Treaty which relates to the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi.</P>
<P><Q>The river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi &s;hall, however, <HI>according to the treaty of peace,</HI> be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on the Ea&s;tern &s;ide, to which&s;oever of the parties belong|ing, may freely be re&s;orted to, and u&s;ed by both par|ties in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the United States or his Maje&s;ty in Great Britain.</Q></P>
<P>The eighth article of the treaty of peace is in the following words:</P>
<P><Q><HI>The navigation of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, from its &s;ource to the ocean, &s;hall forever remain free and open to the &s;ubjects of Great Britain, and to the citizens of the United States.</HI></Q></P>
<P>What is the re&s;ult of the compari&s;on of the Bri|ti&s;h and Spani&s;h Treaties?&mdash;The Briti&s;h &s;ays the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi <HI>&s;hall</HI> forever remain free and open to <HI>the &s;ub|jects of Great Britain;</HI> the Spani&s;h Treaty on the con|trary &s;ays, it &s;hall be free <HI>only to the &s;ubjects of his Ca|tholic Maje&s;ty and the citizens of the United States.</HI> From the terms of the article it will be ob&s;erved, that it conveys the idea of a right on the part of the Uni|ted States to the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi; for if
<PB N="48" REF="032172_0053_0FF168CD97F92948">they had not a right them&s;elves they could not grant it to another, and guarantee this right to the &s;ubjects of Great Britain; if then, the United Sates are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, they are bound to po&s;&s;e&s;s Great Britain of it. As long as we had not the u&s;e of that river our&s;elves, Great Britain could not exact from us the right to navigate it; but no &s;oon|er do we become &s;eized of it our&s;elves, than the ob|ligation commences to extend it to them.</P>
<P>The clau&s;e in the explanatory article to this point reads thus:</P>
<P><Q>And do by the&s;e pre&s;ents explicitly agree and de|clare, that <HI>no &s;tipulation in any treaty</HI> &s;ub&s;equently con|cluded by either of the contracting parties with <HI>any other &s;tate or nation,</HI> or with any Indian Tribe, <HI>can be under&s;tood to derogate in any manner from the rights of free intercour&s;e and commerce &s;ecured by the afore&s;aid third ar|ticle of the treaty of amity, commerce and navigation to the &s;ubjects of his Maje&s;ty,</HI> and to the citizens of the United States, and the Indians dwelling on either &s;ide of the Boundary Line afore&s;aid.</Q></P>
<P>The Spani&s;h Treaty is po&s;terior to the Briti&s;h Trea|ty, and therefore, any clau&s;e in that treaty which in|terferes with the treaty with Great Britain is complete|ly done away by the explanatory article. How then is the difficulty to be &s;olved? Is Secretary <HI>"Camillus"</HI> ready with &s;ome new logic (for I cannot believe that the &s;ucce&s;&s;or in form under&s;tands the article to this day) to convince us that the two Treaties harmoni&s;e? Is not the conclu&s;ion irre&s;i&s;tible, that we mu&s;t either renounce the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi our&s;elves, or confirm it to Great Britain in common with our&s;elves, and thereby incur a war with Spain?</P>
<P>There is a wonderful aptitude in the Executive, by which I do not mean the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in form to their pre|dece&s;&s;ors,
<PB N="49" REF="032172_0054_0FF1684212075B40">to interpret things &s;o as to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of the day. The French Treaty has experienced the in|genuity of Executive expo&s;ition, and has been made to mean any thing or nothing according to the wi&s;hes of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try. Perhaps Spain may be equally pliant with France, and &s;ubmit to the interpretation which the Executive may think fit to give. Indeed &s;uch has been the &s;ucce&s;s at impo&s;ition, that perhaps Spain may be per&s;uaded, that &s;o far from the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i|&s;ippi being injurious to her if extended to Great Britain, that &s;he will receive abundant benefits by even admitting the &s;ubjects of his Britannic maje&s;ty to the mines of Mex|ico and Peru; for as many of the people of the United States have been &s;o far impo&s;ed upon as to be made to believe that the Briti&s;h Treaty is a good and proper one, the Spaniards may, with the &s;ame original pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, and certainly with equal ju&s;tice, be per&s;uaded that Great Britain ought to have the right to navigate the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, for that &s;he is the be&s;t friend, the be&s;t neighbour and the mo&s;t peaceable, the mo&s;t benevolent, and the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted nation upon earth. Thirty-nine long winded numbers may work miracles upon the Spa|ni&s;h court, unle&s;s indeed their natural love of ea&s;e &s;hould make them loath a farrago of fal&s;ehood and perver&s;ion. Perhaps the effect may be as wonderful as that experienced by the Pre&s;ident, who could &s;ee more difficulties and &s;a|crifices in the Briti&s;h Treaty every time he read it, and yet after all, feel him&s;elf &s;o much converted (I will not &s;ay as St. Paul was) as to lo&s;e &s;ight of common decorum and propriety in promulgating it as the &s;upreme law of the land.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE more the explanatory article is viewed, the dar|ker does it appear. It is a foul lepro&s;y upon the body politic, which ages will hardly clean&s;e. That the Ex|ecutive &s;hould have made a Treaty with the Indian Tribes po&s;teriorly to the Briti&s;h Treaty, and recognize &s;tipu|lations repugnant to the anterior treaty, can &s;carcly find an apology even from an idolater. Is this pub|lic faith? Is it common honour? Is it common ho|ne&s;ty? <Q>The &s;everal principles already e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;ays Burlamaqui, concerning the validity of con|ventions in general, agree to public Treaties, as well as to the contracts of individuals. In both, therefore, there mu&s;t be a &s;erious con&s;ent, pro|perly declared, and exempt from <HI>error, fraud</HI> and <HI>violence.</HI></Q> Let us te&s;t the Executive negociation with the Indian Tribes by this rule. A Treaty was conclu|ded with the Indian Tribes at Greenville on the 3d of Augu&s;t, 1795. In this treaty it was &s;tipulated, Ar|ticle 8th, <Q>Trade &s;hall be opened with the &s;aid Indian Tribes; and they do hereby re&s;pectively engage to af|ford protections to &s;uch per&s;ons, with their proper|ty, as &s;hall be duly licen&s;ed to re&s;ide among them for the purpo&s;e of trade, and to their agents and &s;er|vants; but <HI>no per&s;on &s;hall be permitted to re&s;ide at any of their towns or hunting camps as a trader, who is not furni&s;hed with a licence for that purpo&s;e, under the hand and &s;eal of the &s;uperintendant of the Department North We&s;t of the Ohio or &s;uch other per&s;on as the Pre&s;ident of the United States &s;hall authorize to grant &s;uch licences; to the end that the &s;aid Indians may not be impo&s;ed on in their trade.</HI> And if any licen&s;ed trader &s;hall abu&s;e his privilege by unfair dealing, upon complaint and
<PB N="51" REF="032172_0056_0FF168D1710AB000">proof thereof, his licence &s;hall be taken from him, and he &s;hall be further puni&s;hed according to the laws of the United States. And if any per&s;on &s;hall intrude him&s;elf as a trader, without &s;uch licen&s;e the &s;aid Indians &s;hall take and bring him before the Su|perintendant or his Deputy, to be dealt with accord-to law. And to prevent impo&s;ition by forged licen|&s;es, the &s;aid Indians &s;hall, at lea&s;t once a year, give information to the Superintendant or his Deputies, of the names of the traders re&s;iding among&s;t them.</Q></P>
<P>The treaty with Great Britain was concluded at London the nineteenth day of November, 1794, and was ratified by the Senate the 24th of June 1795. In this Treaty and in the 3d article of it, we find the fol|lowing &s;tipulation. "It is agreed, <HI>that it &s;hall at all times be free to his Maje&s;tys &s;ubjects,</HI> and to the citizens of the United States, and al&s;o to the Indians dwelling on either &s;ide of the &s;aid boundary line, <HI>freely to pa&s;s and repa&s;s by land or inland navigation, into the re&s;pective territories and countries of the two contracting parties on the continent of America</HI> (the country within the limits of the Hud&s;ons Bay Company only excepted) and to navigate all the lakes, rivers, and waters thereof, and <HI>freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other.</HI>"</P>
<P>It is no compliment to a mans penetration to di&s;|cover, that the&s;e two articles are at war with each o|ther&mdash;to do away the colli&s;ion was the object of the explanatory article. Let me now a&s;k, whether, in the negociation with the Indian tribes, there was "<HI>a &s;eri|ous con&s;ent, properly declared, and exempt from error, fraud and violence?</HI> Was there no <HI>fraud</HI> in &s;tipu|lating with the Indian Tribes, that no per&s;on &s;hould be permitted to re&s;ide at any of their towns or hunt|ing camps as a trader, who was not furni&s;hed with a li&s;ence for that purpo&s;e," when an anterior Treaty declared that Briti&s;h &s;ubjects &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s this right?</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="032172_0057_0FF168D7B3451388">
The face of the 8th article of the Indian Treaty &s;hews, that they con&s;idered it as an important &s;tipula|tion; for the licen&s;es were to be granted <HI>"to the end that the Indians might not be impo&s;ed on in their trade.</HI>" Was there no <HI>fraud</HI> in pretending to &s;ecure the Indians again&s;t impo&s;ition in their trade by Treaty, and then an|nulling the promi&s;ed &s;ecurity by an explanatory article? Was there no <HI>fraud</HI> in making a Treaty, and then ex|plaining it away without the con&s;ent of the other par|ty? Was there no <HI>fraud</HI> in an American Secretary of State and a Briti&s;h Charge d'Affaires interpreting <HI>an Indian Treaty</HI> at plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>I have already proved, that the Executive had no right to interpret a Treaty at <HI>his plea&s;ure;</HI> but that there is the &s;ame reciprocity of interpretation due, that there was in the contract. As then the Executive in|terpreted the Indian Treaty at his plea&s;ure, he violated that Treaty, and was guilty of a breach of the laws of nations. "He who violates his Treaties, &s;ays Vattel, violates at the &s;ame time the law of nations; for he de&s;pi&s;es the faith of Treaties, that faith which the law of nations declares &s;acred, and he does all in his power to render it vain.&mdash;Doubly guilty, he does an injury to his ally, he does an injury to all nations, and wounds the whole human race."</P>
<P>Further. "It is &s;hewn by the law of nature, that <HI>he who has made a promi&s;e to any one, has conferred upon him a true right, to require the thing promi&s;ed; and that, con&s;equently, not to keep a perfect promi&s;e, is to violate the right of another; and is as manife&s;t an in|ju&s;tice, as that of depriving a per&s;on of his property.</HI> All the tranquility, the happine&s;s, and &s;ecurity of the human race, re&s;ts on ju&s;tice; on the obligation of paying a regard to the rights of others. The re&s;pect of others for our rights of domain and pro|perty con&s;titute the &s;ecurity of our actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons;
<PB N="53" REF="032172_0058_0FF168D953991318">the faith of promi&s;es is our &s;ecurity for the things that cannot be delivered or executed upon the &s;pot. <HI>There would be no more &s;ecurity, no longer any commerce between mankind did they not believe them|&s;elves obliged to pre&s;erve their faith, and to keep their word.</HI> This obligation is then as nece&s;&s;ary, as it is natural and indubitable between the nations that live together in a &s;tate of nature, and acknowledge no &s;uperior upon earth, to maintain order and peace in their &s;ociety."</P>
<P>Did the Executive make <HI>a promi&s;e</HI> to the Indian Tribes in the 8th article of the Treaty with them? If he did, and that promi&s;e was re&s;cinded without their con&s;ent, did he not violate the rights of tho&s;e Indian Tribes? Is not the violation of that right a violation of the Treaty, and a violation of the laws of nations, which renders him "<HI>doubly guilty, as he does an injury to his ally, as he does an injury to all nations and wounds the human race.</HI>"</P>
<P>For what purpo&s;e, let me a&s;k, did the Executive make a Treaty, which he mu&s;t have known, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e him profoundly ignorant of the Briti&s;h Treaty, could not be fulfilled? Was it ad captandum vulgus, that he al&s;o might be &s;tiled "the prince of peace?" Was it that another pretext might be afforded the In|dians, in our violation of one of the articles, to keep up a frontier war, that a Major General and others might be provided for, and the public debt be made &s;u&s;ceptible of multiplication? Was it that the nucleus of a &s;tanding army might be completely formed? The in&s;ecurity of Treaties with &s;avages has furni&s;hed &s;ub|jects for many an animated harangue; but have the United States more to boa&s;t of than &s;avages in this in&s;tance? Did not the Executive <HI>deceive</HI> the Indians by entering into a contract with them, that "<HI>no per&s;on</HI> be permitted to re&s;ide at any of their towns or hunt|ing camps as a trader who was not furni&s;hed with
<PB N="54" REF="032172_0059_0FF168DB0AD1BEB0">a licen&s;e for that purpo&s;e," when by the Briti&s;h Trea|ty, <HI>the &s;ubjects of Great Britain</HI> were exempted from this obligation? Mr. Jay's in&s;tructions &s;tates in un|equivocal terms, that "we have &s;atisfactory proofs, &s;ome of which, however, cannot, as you will di&s;cern, be well u&s;ed <HI>in public,</HI> that Briti&s;h agents are guilty of &s;tirring up and a&s;&s;i&s;ting with arms, ammunition and warlike in&s;truments and implements, the differ|ent tribes of Indians again&s;t us;" was it, then, for the purpo&s;e of giving Briti&s;h agents a better opportu|nity of exciting the Indians again&s;t us, that they are thus permitted to rove at large, although prohibited by the Indian Treaty? Would the obligation to have a licen&s;e re&s;trict them too much, by placing them upon a footing with <HI>Amercan citizens?</HI> Was it the object of the Executive to have a greater &s;olicitude for a Briti&s;h &s;ubject than an American citizen?</P>
<P>If uncivilized nations feel the obligation of Treaties le&s;s than tho&s;e who are more advanced in refinement, does this furni&s;h an argument for deceiving them? Chi|canery in negotiation is a &s;tain upon the national cha|racter, and how our Executive will acquit him&s;elf in having made a Treaty with the Indian tribes repugnant to another Treaty anteriorly made, we &s;hall perhaps, di&s;cover, when the dark mi&s;t of &s;ecre&s;y which &s;urrounds his cabinet &s;hall be di&s;&s;ipated.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>THE explanatory article annihilates the &s;ecurity which the Indians promi&s;ed them&s;elves under the Grenville Treaty; and what is very remarkable, the 8th article of this Treaty is but a tran&s;cript of the 7th arti|cle of the Treaty concluded with the &s;ame Indians at
<PB N="55" REF="032172_0060_0FF168DCB21B4540">Fort Harmer, in the year 1789, long before the Bri|ti&s;h Treaty was thought of, and long before a Briti&s;h faction was matured, or a Chief Magi&s;trate of the Uni|ted States had become its patron&mdash;nay its head. De|ception in this in&s;tance mu&s;t have been reduced to a &s;cience, or why was an article from the Fort Harmer Treaty, copied almo&s;t verbatim unto the Grenville Treaty? Had not the Indians the be&s;t of rea&s;ons to &s;uppo&s;e, that the former Treaty was recognized as far as related to the 7th article, when not only the &s;ub&s;tance but the form of that article was retained in the la&s;t Trea|ty? Perhaps I &s;hould not go too far in a&s;&s;erting, that this article has a priority to the Briti&s;h Treaty, ina&s;|much as it is a part of the Treaty of 1789, and that the Executive was not con&s;titutionally authorized to ren|der it &s;ub&s;ervient to the views and intere&s;ts of Great Britain. This, however, I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon, as my object is to &s;hew that &s;uch is the Briti&s;h ca&s;t of our Executive, that neither the faith nor the intere&s;ts of the nation are cords &s;trong enough to bind the Admi|ni&s;tration when in colli&s;ion with the wi&s;hes of the Briti&s;h Cabinet.</P>
<P>Although I never could a&s;&s;ent to that plenitude of wi&s;dom a&s;cribed to the Executive and although I never could di&s;cover evidences enough to &s;atisfy my mind that he was a <HI>Solomon,</HI> yet I am unwilling to believe him &s;o ignorant of the alphabet of the laws of nations, as not to know, that he was <HI>deceiving</HI> the Indians by admit|ting &s;tipulations in his Treaty with them, which his idolatry for Great Britain, had already rendered nugatory by a Treaty with her.</P>
<P>The preference, the unqualified preference given to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects at the expence of American citizens by the explanatory article, perhaps, ought not to excite new a&s;toni&s;hment, when we con&s;ider, that Briti&s;h in|tere&s;ts have generally had more attention, and have excited more &s;olicitude, than the intere&s;ts of Americans
<PB N="56" REF="032172_0061_0FF168E313BE3300">Indeed were any additional te&s;timony, more than the world is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub&s;tantiate the identity of the following pa&s;&s;age in certain private let|ters, <HI>"I love my King, you know I do; a &s;oldier and a good man cannot but love him,"</HI> the uniform pro&s;tra|tion of our national intere&s;t and character at the feet of his <HI>beloved King,</HI> would &s;ubdue the mo&s;t &s;tubborn &s;ceptici&s;m. When Briti&s;h &s;ubjects are allowed more privileges, even within our own territory, than Ameri|can citizens&mdash;when American citizens are &s;urrendered to impre&s;&s;ment, even without a murmur from the Exe|cutive, to man the Briti&s;h Kings navy to fight again&s;t their deliverers, and again&s;t tho&s;e who were once re|cognized as friends and as allies&mdash;when under the fulle&s;t conviction, that Great Britain was aiding the Savages in their murderous warfare, our Executive would ki&s;s the knife and the tomahawk of tho&s;e bloody a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, by greeting <HI>the King</HI> as his <HI>"great good and dear friend"</HI>&mdash; when honour the mo&s;t &s;acred, and rights the mo&s;t e&s;timable are pro&s;trated in humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion before a perfidious and barbarous Monarch, where is the care for <HI>American</HI> intere&s;ts&mdash;where is the &s;olicitude for <HI>Ame|rican</HI> rights&mdash;where is the concern for <HI>American</HI> &s;ecu|rity &mdash;where is the feeling for <HI>American</HI> honour and independence? If &s;uch is the reign of idolatry that the voice of ju&s;tice cannot now be heard, po&s;terity will deal impartialy with the man who has paralyzed his countrys efforts;&mdash;who has leagued him&s;elf with a Government, the &s;worn foe to Liberty; who has ren|dered a Treaty, the price of our independence, mere paper and parchment; and who has endeavoured to convert a nation of Freemen into a race of Eunuchs.</P>
<P>Having demon&s;trated that the Spani&s;h and Indian Treaties have been violated in two of their mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial articles, it remains only to prove, that by the laws of nations both Treaties are annulled. "We cannot con&s;ider the &s;everal articles of the &s;ame Treaty, &s;ays Vattel, as &s;o many particular and independent Trea|ties;
<PB N="57" REF="032172_0062_0FF168E4ADA2C510">for though we do not &s;ee an immediate connec|tion between every one of the&s;e articles, they are all connected by this common relation, that the contract|ing powers pa&s;s them with a view to each other, by way of compen&s;ation&mdash;I &s;hould never perhaps have pa&s;&s;ed this article if my ally had not granted me a|nother, which in its own nature, has no relation to it. Every thing comprehended in the &s;ame treaty has then the force and nature of reciprocal promi&s;ed, at lea&s;t if they are not excepted in due form. Gro|tius &s;ays very well, that all the articles of a Treaty have the force of conditions, which by a default are rendered null."</P>
<P>Again. "La&s;tly, the peace is broken by the vio|lation of any of the expre&s;s articles of the Treaty. This third manner of breaking it is mo&s;t deci&s;ive, the lea&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of chicanery and eva&s;ion. Who|ever fails in engagements, as far as in him lies, an|nuls the contract; this is beyond all doubt."</P>
<Q><P>But it is a&s;ked, whether the violation of one arti|cle only of the treaty may cau&s;e the total rupture of it? Some here di&s;tingui&s;h between the articles con|nected together <HI>(connexi)</HI> and the &s;eperate articles <HI>(di|ver&s;i)</HI> and pronounce, that though the Treaty be vi|olated in the &s;eperate articles, the peace &s;ub&s;i&s;ts with regard to the other.&mdash;But to me Grotiuss opinion &s;eems evidently founded on the nature and &s;pirit of Treaties of peace. This Great man &s;ays, that all the articles of one and the &s;ame Treaty are conditi|onally included in one another, as if it had been for|mally &s;aid; I will do this, provided on your &s;ide you do that. And he ju&s;tly adds that, when it is de|&s;igned that the engagement &s;hall not be rendered in|effectual thereby, this expre&s;s clau&s;e is in&s;erted; that though any one of the articles of a Treaty &s;hould be broken, the other neverthele&s;s &s;hall &s;ub&s;i&s;t
<PB N="58" REF="032172_0063_0FF168E6643C8CE0">in their whole force.&mdash;Such an agreement may un|que&s;tionably be made.</P>
<P>It may likewi&s;e be agreed, that the violation of one article &s;hall produce only the nullity of tho&s;e cor|re&s;ponding to it. And which, as it were, con&s;titute the equivalent to it.</P>
<P>But if this clau&s;e be not expre&s;sly &s;pecified in the Treaty of peace, the violation of one &s;ingle article overthrown the whole Treaty, as we have proved above in &s;peaking of Treaties in general.</P>
<P>It is in the nature of all compacts in general, &s;ays Burlamaqui, that when one of the parties violates the engagements into which he had entered by Trea|ty the other is freed, and may refu&s;e to &s;tand to the agreement; for generally each article of a Treaty has the force of a condition, the want of which renders it void.</P>
<P>This is generally the ca&s;e, that is to &s;ay when there is no agreement otherwi&s;e; for &s;ometimes this clau&s;e is in&s;erted, that the violation of any &s;ingle article of the Treaty &s;hall not break it entirely, to the end that neither party &s;hould fly from the en|gagements for every &s;light offence. But he who by the action of another, &s;uffers any damage, ought to be indemnified in &s;ome &s;hape or other.</P></Q>
<P>Let me now a&s;k, whether in the Spani&s;h or Indian Treaties provi&s;ion is made, that the violation of one ar|ticle &s;hall not invalidate the whole treaty? For with|out a &s;pecific provi&s;ion of this fort, it is undeniable, that both Treaties are rendered ineffectual, &s;hould the par|ties think proper to avail them&s;elves of our mi&s;con|duct. If Spain and the Indian Tribes, pitying the the weakne&s;s and depravity of our admini&s;tration, and &s;corning to vi&s;it its &s;ins upon the heads of the people,

<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>TO give a complete portrait of the character and di&s;po&s;ition of the Executive, the infractions of the treaty with France mu&s;t be taken into the colouring. A full detail of the&s;e would cap the climax of ba&s;ene&s;s, hypo|cri&s;y, and perfidy. It &s;hall be my ta&s;k to enumerate tho&s;e which have not e&s;caped my memory, and I &s;hall leave the re&s;t to be &s;upplied by the recollection of every man, who has been an attentive &s;pectator of the intere&s;t|ing &s;enes which his country has exhibited.</P>
<P>The proclamation of neutrality is fir&s;t in order; for until France became a <HI>Republic,</HI> the Executive was attentive to the engagements which had been made with the monarch. Mo&s;t probably had &s;he continued under the old regime, and a war with Great Britain had been conducted under ever circum&s;tance of inveteracy and and de&s;peration, the Apo&s;tle of Liberty at the head of our affairs, would have either became a party with her, or he would have maintained a neutrality un&s;u&s;ceptible of the character of fraudulent. France however became a Republic, and a proclamation of neutrality was i&s;&s;ued. I have already demon&s;trated, that the clau&s;es in the Trea|ty of Alliance which related to us, admitting the Treaty to be purely de&s;en&s;ive, were completely operative, as Great Britain made the fir&s;t actual declaration of war
<PB N="60" REF="032172_0065_0FF168EEC4E89F50">again&s;t France. If this be true, and no hone&s;t man can deny it, upon what foundation does the proclamation of neutrality re&s;t? Is it not an evident and a palpable con|travention of the Treaty? Could we remain neutral and yet fulfil the clau&s;e of guarantee? At the time of the arrival of the mini&s;ter of the French Republic here, we were in a &s;tate of peace with Great Britain: this &s;tate of peace mu&s;t have continued until ho&s;tilites were either commenced or declared by one of the parties, whence then the nece&s;&s;ity of a delaration of neutraliy? The pro|clamation then was intended to neutralize the Treaty with France, and to determine the conduct of the United States, before they were called upon to fulfill their nati|onal faith&mdash;It was telling France, that we were detemin|ed to take no part in her differences, whatever may have been our engagements to the contrary. Did any other nation except the United States i&s;&s;ue proclamtions of neu|trality? If no nation with whom France was not con|nected by Treaty pur&s;ued this &s;y&s;tem of policy, what mu&s;t be &s;aid of the United States, who in the face of a Treaty of Alliance made this manife&s;tation?</P>
<P>In the Treaty of Alliance there is a reciprocal guaran|tee. France guarantees to the United Sates her inde|pendence, and we guarantee her We&s;t India po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, and this may be &s;aid to be truly the <HI>ca&s;us federis.</HI>&mdash; If the independence of the United States had been at|tacked, would it not have ben a paramount obligation in France to fly to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, without weighing the circum&s;tances which led to it in a gold &s;cales? Perfidy would have been a mild term in our mouths again&s;t her if &s;he had he&s;itated, much more refu&s;ed&mdash;But in&s;tead of our independence the We&s;t India po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of France are attacked&mdash;how &s;tands the clau&s;e of guarantee then in this ca&s;e? If France was obligated to aid us in ca&s;e our independence was attacked, we were equally bound to aid her in ca&s;e her We&s;t India po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were attacked, The ca&s;us federis is reciprocal, and the charge of perfidy in ca&s;e of failure, applies equally to both parties&mdash;No
<PB N="61" REF="032172_0066_0FF168F0771F6B70">truth can be more apparent, then that the proclamation of neutrality was an infraction of the Treaty.</P>
<P>The privilege allowed Briti&s;h &s;hips of war to enter our ports, after having made prize of the property be|longing to French citizens, affords another in&s;tance of di&s;regard to national &s;aith. I have in a former letter cited the article of the Treaty to this point. It is &s;o unequivocal, that Machiavel him&s;elf would hardly have the front to cavil about it&mdash;Not only have Briti&s;h &s;hips of war found acce&s;s to our ports; but the Africa at|tempted to &s;eize the mini&s;ter of France within the ter|ritory of the United States! After <HI>a months delibera|tion,</HI> the Africa was ordered to quit the port for this unexampled outrage; <HI>but this did not happen until the Medu&s;a was ready to &s;ail!</HI> The Cleopatra retook the Pamela within the capes, and yet this &s;ame Cleopatra is permitted to enter our ports at plea&s;ure, without any indemnity having been made for the capture, or any &s;atisfaction for the outrage upon our &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t rigid <HI>look-out</HI> has been kept by the admini&s;|tration that French privateers &s;hould not be armed in the United States. Punctilio has been refined upon to embarra&s;s all armed ve&s;&s;els belonging to the French Re|public, while Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els have been actnally armed in our ports, without the lea&s;t hindrance from the go|vernment &mdash;Out of many in&s;tances I will mention a few, to remove any doubts of the facts.&mdash;At Baltimore the Tru&s;ty was publicly armed as a privateer, notwith|&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of the Con&s;ul. In the months of May and June 1793, &s;everal Briti&s;h and one Dutch ve&s;&s;el were armed at Charle&s;ton, and yet when French merchantmen were attempted to be armed for &s;elf-defence, the government immediately interpo&s;ed and prevented them. At Norfolk &s;everal French mer|chantmen, who were arming for &s;elf-defence, were arre&s;ted by order of the admini&s;tration in 1794, and although the mini&s;ter complained, his complaints were di&s;regard|ed
<PB N="62" REF="032172_0067_0FF168F3498EE640">The Argonaut captured the corvette lE&s;perance and &s;ent her into Lynn Haven bay, where &s;he was re|fitted and &s;ent on a cruize. In this ca&s;e the mini&s;ter complained likewi&s;e, but he received neither &s;atisfaction nor indemnity.</P>
<P>I could &s;well the black catalogue of infractions to a &s;ize, which would perhaps appal the Executive him&s;elf; but I have already exhibited an ample &s;pecimen of the <HI>good faith</HI> of our government, and &s;hall now content my|&s;elf with the addition of the la&s;t outrage upon national honour by the government&mdash;<HI>the revocation of the right to &s;ell French prizes in our ports</HI>&mdash;Not content with making the Spani&s;h and Indian Treaties &s;ub&s;ervient to Great Britain, the Executive &s;eemed determined to make the Briti&s;h Treaty the Athana&s;ian creed of polities, and ex|communicate the heretical Treaty with France. This Treaty was a memento of Briti&s;h di&s;grace, and one of the monuments of our independence; no wonder then the Executive &s;hould wi&s;h to remove &s;o offen&s;ive a thing from the view of his <HI>"great, good and dear friend."</HI></P>
<P>Although the right to &s;ell prizes within our ports is not expre&s;sly granted by Treaty, it was acknowledged by the Executive, and prizes were made &s;ale of, until the fini&s;h|ing hand was put to the Briti&s;h Treaty. If the right was not &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t in the Treaty with France, upon what principle was it allowed by the Executive? Either the French have a right to &s;ell their prizes, or the have not&mdash;If they have a right, it is a daring viola|tion of Treaty to retract it&mdash;If they have not a right, the Executive made an inroad upon our neutrality by permitting it. He has contradicted thereby his own edict of neutrality, and is an offender again&s;t the declared will of the fir&s;t Magi&s;trate of the United States! Was ever inju&s;tice or ab&s;urdity more apparent!</P>
<P>But why was the revocation re&s;erved until the con|&s;ummation of the Briti&s;h Treaty? Was not the Re|public
<PB N="63" REF="032172_0068_0FF168F4EC9BC108">of France repeatedly a&s;&s;ured, that nothing in this Treaty contradicted the privileges of the Treaty with her? It has been a&s;&s;erted, that the revocation was pre|dicated on the colli&s;ion between the two Treaties&mdash;Can this be po&s;&s;ible? Can the admini&s;tration be &s;o com|pletely immer&s;ed in iniquity, as to have bottomed the revocation upon a Treaty <HI>&s;ub&s;equently</HI> concluded? This would be not only a contradiction of them&s;elves, but a contradiction of the e&s;tabli&s;hed law of nations, and of the eternal and immutable principles of ju&s;tice. The Spani&s;h and Indian Treaties were made to cede to the Briti&s;h Treaty, becau&s;e they were junior Treaties. This was the opinion of the Executive as expre&s;&s;ed in the ex|planatory article.</P>
<P>But why was this revocation re&s;erved until the will of the repre&s;entative body was known? This will &s;eemed clearly to be, that the prohibition to &s;ell prizes &s;hould not contravene exi&s;ting engagements, and even the Se|nate of the United States made this amendment to the bill. Does the Executive mean to per&s;i&s;t in his con|tempt of the people by treating with contempt the opi|nion of their repre&s;entatives? When Jay was appoint|ed a mi&s;&s;ionary to manife&s;t our repentance for being in|dependent, the will of the repre&s;entatives had a differ|ent tendency and, inter alia, to oppo&s;e this will was the object of the Executive. The revocation had its ri&s;e in a mixed feeling, in which the &s;ame contempt was an ingredient, and manife&s;ted the &s;ame domineer|ing &s;pirit, which dictated the arrogant and imperious an&s;wer to the petition from the people of the town of Bo&s;ton again&s;t the ratification of the Treaty.</P>
<P>Why was it re&s;erved for the pre&s;ent Chief Ju&s;tice to declare, that French prizes &s;hould not be &s;old in the United States? Was there too much virtue in the ci|devant chief ju&s;tice to expect &s;uch a declaration from him, that it was not made before? When Diony&s;ius turns <HI>land-jobber</HI> what may we not expect!</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="032172_0069_0FF168F8EBD494C0">
Hitherto it has been an affair of Executive cognizance alone, whether prizes &s;hould or &s;hould nat be &s;old; but <HI>all of a &s;udden</HI> the chief ju&s;tice undertakes to pro|nounce upon it, and declares its illegality. Here again we undertake to <HI>interpret Treaties at plea&s;ure,</HI> in defiance of the laws of nations.</P>
<P>If anything could impre&s;s the world with an abhorrence and contempt for the American character, the conduct of the Executive towards France would be indelible. The ingratitude, hypocri&s;y, and perfidy of the govern|ment towards her, mu&s;t remain a la&s;ting monument of infamy again&s;t the United States; and pity it is that the people are obliged to participate in the di&s;grace. What ought to add to the remor&s;e of the Executive is, that while our conduct has &s;erved to e&s;trange from us our be&s;t friend, it has not conciliated the good will of that na|tion to whom every thing has been &s;acrificed&mdash;Their contempt and barbarities have ri&s;en in a degree equal to our pro&s;titution, and we are daily witne&s;&s;ing outra|ges, that would produce a blu&s;h even in the mo&s;t pro|fligate and abandoned.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>IN the enumeration of the infractions of the Treaty with France, I purpo&s;ely omitted the <HI>acquie&s;cence</HI> of the Executive in the impre&s;&s;ment of our &s;eamen. This is an infraction of a &s;olemn nature, both in relation to our allies, and as applicable to our&s;elves, and de&s;erves a &s;pe|cific con&s;ideration. It is a virtual oppo&s;ition to France, and &s;tamps our government as an acce&s;&s;ory in the war
<PB N="65" REF="032172_0070_0FF168FBC21D9870">again&s;t that Republic. Would, could our admini&s;tra|tion &s;ubmit to &s;uch outrages as tho&s;e committed upon our flag, and to the barbarities exerci&s;ed upon tho&s;e &s;ail|ing under it, without being in &s;ecret combination with the nation committing them? Scarcely a day elap&s;es without an account of further impre&s;&s;ments. Not a week pa&s;&s;es over our heads without a recital of &s;ome hor|rid barbarity exerci&s;ed upon the American mariners&mdash; barbarity &s;ufficient to rou&s;e the revenge of any man, not dead to the feelings of humanity and to his countrys in|tere&s;ts. Have the walls of the American <HI>divan</HI> been rendered impenetrable to the agonizing cries of Ameri|can citizens? Has Pitt with his <HI>magic wand</HI> de&s;cribed a circle about the Executive <HI>conclave,</HI> that American feelings and American intere&s;ts are denied admittance? What <HI>&s;pell</HI> has been put upon the admini&s;tration, that tho&s;e they are bound to protect, excite no more &s;olici|tude than if they were inhabitants of California? When it was rumoured that the Executive Directory intended to call us to account for our per&s;idies, a ci-devant trea|&s;ury officer, and the chief juggler of the legerdemain tricks of our government, expre&s;&s;ed his hope, <HI>that the patrioti&s;m of the &s;outhern States would lead them to an union with the ea&s;tern again&s;t France, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould carry &s;uch intention into effect!</HI> This <HI>Judas I&s;cariot</HI> of our country felt hot for war when the Republic of France was the object of it; but every outrage, every barbarity, and every indignity was to be endured, ra|ther than energetic mea&s;ures &s;hould be adopted again&s;t his idol Great Britain. No wonder our country lies pro&s;trate and is at them mercy of a Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, when the chief automaton is made to re&s;pond to &s;o unprincipl|ed and profligate a creole!</P>
<P>The willing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Executive to the impre&s;&s;|ment of our &s;eamen to man the Briti&s;h navy is not only an infraction of our Treaty, but is a po&s;itive contraven|tion of our neutrality. In &s;peaking of the conduct to be ob&s;erved by a neutral nation, Vattel makes the fol|lowing
<PB N="66" REF="032172_0071_0FF168FE97B4F458">remarks. <Q>Let us then &s;ee wherein this impar|tiality, which a neutral nation is to ob&s;erve, con&s;i&s;ts It relates &s;olely to war, and includes two articles, one <HI>not to give any &s;uccours</HI> when there is no obliga|tion, nor freely to furni&s;h troops, arms, ammunition, or any thing of direct u&s;e in war. I &s;ay, <HI>to give no succours,</HI> and not to give equally, for that a &s;tate &s;hould at one and the &s;ame time &s;uccour two &s;tates, would be ab&s;urd, as be&s;ides it would be impo&s;&s;ible to do it equally.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A nation that without any other motive than the pro&s;|pect of gain, is employed in &s;trengthening my enemy, with|out regarding how far I may &s;uffer, is certainly far from being my friend, and gives me a right to con&s;ider and treat it as an a&s;&s;ociate of my enemy.</Q></P>
<P>Have not the United State <HI>&s;uccoured</HI> Great Britain by conniving at the impre&s;&s;ments of our &s;eamen? Are not numbers of our &s;eamen on board Briti&s;h &s;hips of war? By permitting this, are we not &s;trengthening the enemy of France, and giving her a right to confider and treat us as an a&s;&s;ociate of that enemy? Is not this a violation of our neutrality and an infraction of our Treaty? The Treaty of Alliance &s;tipulates that we &s;hall aid France; but in&s;tead of aiding her, we are aiding her enemy!</P>
<P>The conduct of our admini&s;tration in permitting the impre&s;&s;ment of our &s;eamen and leaving them to their fate, reflects the deepe&s;t di&s;honour on the government. The little Republic of Genoa &s;corned an humiliation le&s;s extravagant, and re&s;i&s;ted an attempt of Briti&s;h en|croachment with a manline&s;s, which has rendered her re&s;pected. Poor America is degraded almo&s;t below contempt! We have exhibited le&s;s &s;pirit than the <HI>Ca|ribbs</HI> of St. Vincents when the Briti&s;h government in 1768 attempted to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them of their rights. They di&s;dained to pro&s;trate them&s;elves without a &s;truggle, they re&s;i&s;ted and &s;ucceeded, and obliged the government of
<PB N="67" REF="032172_0072_0FF16900391F7578">Great Britain to confirm their rights by a Treaty. <Q>The Treaty between the Caribbs of St. Vincents and the king of Great Britain, &s;ays a modern hi&s;torian, is a monument of hi&s;torical curio&s;ity, singularly valu|able as a &s;triking confirmation of the utility and im|portance of the magnimous maxim, in no circum|&s;tances to de&s;pair of the commonwealth.</Q></P>
<P>Even the Caribbs of St. Vincents would have blu&s;hed at a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch an outrage as that committed on capt. Je&s;&s;op. What nation be&s;ides the American, would tamely bear to have a captain of a ve&s;&s;el &s;ailing under their flag, &s;courged by order of a command|er of a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el of war, until he was ready to expire under the torture? What mu&s;t be the <HI>principles</HI> or <HI>&s;en&s;ations</HI> of an admini&s;tration, that could acquie&s;ce in &s;uch barbarity and outrage? Can &s;uch men be &s;tiled the guardians of American honour, rights, or indepen|dence?</P>
<P>Already have the Briti&s;h upwards of two thou&s;and American &s;eamen impre&s;&s;ed on board their &s;hips of war, and yet our admini&s;tration is as ea&s;y under it as if Great Britain was defending our rights, and protect|ing our commerce. The impre&s;&s;ments are continuing daily; no &s;pirited exertions on the part of the Executive to prevent it, any yet &s;ome among us dare to talk of na|tional faith and neutrality! This is, I &s;uppo&s;e, one of the ingredients in a "&s;ix years glorious admini&s;tration!" Speaking of the di&s;turbances in the colonies, Lord Chat|ham made the following memorable reflection.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Better were it for them to peri&s;h in a glorious conten|tion for their rights, than to purcha&s;e a &s;lavi&s;h tranqui|lity at the expence of a &s;ingle iota of the Con&s;titution.</HI></Q> How much to be lamented that a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch a mind and &s;uch an heart was not the Chief Magi&s;trate of the United States. Our commerce would then have been free from re&s;traint, and our &s;eamen would then have found &s;ympathy and protection.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="032172_0073_0FF1690678B0BDB8">
The &s;pirit which animated our country to re&s;i&s;t Bri|ti&s;h tyranny and to declare independence is, alas, par|alized by &s;y&s;tems, artfully contrived to render the mind pliant to the views of an in&s;idious and ambitious admi|ni&s;tration. Funding and band &s;y&s;tems, with the &s;pecu|lations which have grown out of them, have &s;ub&s;tituted an avarice of wealth, for the glory and love of country. Had America in the year 1775 been what &s;he is now, a nation governed by &s;tock jabbers, &s;tockholders, bank directors and brokers, we &s;hould have hugged the fet|ters which Great Brain had then forged for us.&mdash;War and all its horrors would have been conjured up to our view, and our affrighted &s;ouls would have cla&s;ped the pelf as a &s;ub&s;tance. more precious than liberty.

<P>I have many more facts at command in relation to the conduct of our admini&s;tration. The propo&s;ition of the Republic of France <HI>to naturalize all mercantile citi|zens and thereby to give them a free trade to all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, on condition that the United States would do the &s;ame;</HI> incalculable in benefit as this would have been to our country, even this propo&s;ition was treated by our admini&s;tration with the &s;ame indifferent and di&s;regard which has characteri&s;ed all its actions in relation to that Republic. Other facts of importance might likewi&s;e be pre&s;ented to the public attention, but as the&s;e letters have increa&s;ed beyond my expectation, and as my avo|cations interfere too much with a continuance of them, I will re&s;erve the balance to &s;ome more convenient oc|ca&s;ion. Matter enough has already been given to the people of the United States to cau&s;e hem to reflect &s;e|riou&s;ly; matter enough to rou&s;e them from their torper.

<PB N="70" REF="032172_0075_0FF16909E336ADD0">in&s;truments (&s;peaking of the Briti&s;h and Spani&s;h Trea|ties) do not interfere <HI>at all.</HI>" I cannot &s;uppo&s;ed that he even read the explanatory article, or he certainly would have been le&s;s bold in his a&s;&s;ertion; for it is confe&s;&s;edly predicated on the idea of &s;uch interference. If there was no interference, whence the nece&s;&s;ity, whence the u&s;e of an explanatory article?</P>
<P><Q>When we agree to grant privileges to another coun|try, &s;ays this very able advocate of government, we grant what we po&s;&s;e&s;s at the time of donation and nothing more.</Q> Did we or did we not po&s;&s;e&s;s the right to navigate the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi at the time the ex|planatory article was agreed upon? If we did, and Agricola him&s;elf will hardly deny it, does he not &s;tand convicted by his own po&s;ition? Does not the ex|planation article expre&s;sly declare <Q>that no &s;tipulations <HI>in any Treaty &s;ub&s;equently concluded</HI> by either of the contracting parties with any other &s;tate or nation, or with any Indian Tribe, can be under&s;tood to derogate from the rights of free intercour&s;e and commerce &s;e|cured by the afore&s;aid <HI>third</HI> article of the Treaty to the &s;ubjects of his maje&s;ty?</Q> What free intercour&s;e and commerce were &s;ecured by the third article of the Briti&s;h Treaty? <Q>The river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi &s;hall, however, according to the Treaty of peace be entirely open to both parties.</Q> This is one of the privileges granted by that article. Although at the time the Briti&s;h Treaty was concluded we were not in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, and the right on the part of the Briti&s;h to navigate in depended, as did ours, on a contingency, yet, if even a dilemma exi&s;ted before the conclu&s;ion of the explanatory article, that article removes all doubts and completely confirms the right of Great Britain to navigate that river, in as ample a manner as we po&s;&s;e&s;s it our&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h Treaty was prior to the Spani&s;h, and granted a right which we claimed but did not pe&s;&s;e&s;s.
<PB N="71" REF="032172_0076_0FF1690C10AEACF8">The Spani&s;h Treaty cedes to the United States the navi|gation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi and confirms the right thereto, with an expre&s;s re&s;ervation, that no other nation &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s it, unle&s;s by &s;pecial convention with his Catholic maje&s;ty. The Spani&s;h Treaty then was a repeal of that clau&s;e in the Briti&s;h Treaty which granted this right to Great Britain; but to guard again&s;t this, a new article is entered into confirmatory of &s;uch right. Had no ex|planation taken place doubts might have ari&s;en; but the explanation has left no room for further negotiation. Anxious to anticipate even the wi&s;hes of Great Britain, our admini&s;tration determined to place the United States in a dilemma rather than &s;he &s;hould not receive our en|tire homage.</P>
<P>I would a&s;k Agricola again, whence the u&s;e of an ex|planatory article if the Treaties are not di&s;cordant? He would not &s;urely in&s;inuate that &s;uch was the pa&s;&s;ion of our Admini&s;tration for treating with Great Britain, that they would treat about <HI>nothing?</HI> Paulding him&s;elf could not convey a more bitter &s;arca&s;m. The fact is, the two Treaties are ho&s;tile, and that the explanatory article was de&s;igned, inter alia, to &s;ecure to Great Britain the navi|gation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi.</P>
<P>The river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi is a highway po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in common by Spain and the United States. The u&s;e of this high|way is given by the United States to Great Britain. Could we transfer a right which we did not po&s;&s;e&s;s? If we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the right and made a divi&s;ion of &s;uch right to amother, we became bound to fulfil the contract; for as a Treaty is a contract between two nations, each nation obli|gates it&s;elf to fulfil its part. Under a knowledge, that we had imparted our right to Great Britain did we nego|tiate the Spani&s;h Treaty. If then we meant that Great Britain &s;hould not po&s;&s;e&s;s the right to navigate the Mi&s;&s;i|&s;ippi we deceived her when we declared &s;he &s;hould, if we meant &s;he &s;hould, and at the &s;ame time agreed with
<PB N="72" REF="032172_0077_0FF1690ED36DC528">Spain, that &s;he &s;hould not, we deceived Spain, and where the deception re&s;ts I will leave to Agricola to ex|plain. In one or other of the ca&s;es our faith is commit|ted, and it will require all Agricolas talents to white wa&s;h, the Exccutive.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es where ce&s;&s;ions are made by Treaty, the party ceding is bound to fulfil the contract. Thus when Spain ceded to France the Spani&s;h part of St. Domingo, &s;he formally put the Republic in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. We have made a formal ce&s;&s;ion of the right to navigate the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi to Great Britain, and we are bound to give efficacy to &s;uch ce&s;&s;ion, and in carrying into effect &s;uch &s;tipulation, we expo&s;e our&s;elves to war. Great Britain has a right to call upon us to fulfil our Treaty with her. If we refu&s;e we ri&s;que a war with her, and if we comply we hazard a war with Spain! This is the wi&s;dom and virtue of our government.</P>
<P>The triumphant interrogatories of your corre&s;pon|dent, Sir, rather excite pity than any other &s;en&s;ation. He a&s;ks <Q>if one nation choo&s;es to open all her ports and rivers to another, does if follow, that any future ac|qui&s;ition of territory mu&s;t be made equally free; and all future advatanges imparted in like manner?</Q> Did not the Briti&s;h Treaty &s;pecifically grant to Great Britain the right to navigate the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi? And although the Spani&s;h Treaty is po&s;terior, does not the explanatory ar|ticle, which is po&s;terior to the Spani&s;h Treaty confirm the ce&s;&s;ion? From the complexion of this defence, as well as from its manner I &s;hould be tempted to believe that the negotiator of the explanatory article had en|tered the li&s;ts him&s;elf; for it has &s;trongly imprinted upon it that ability which has manife&s;ted it&s;elf &s;ince he became &s;ucce&s;&s;or in from to his predece&s;&s;or.</P>
