<HEAD>A CAUTION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THESE States are at pre&s;ent expo&s;ed to very threatening dangers. Whether <HI>France</HI> has been ju&s;tly provoked by the con|duct of the late Pre&s;ident and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, or by the temper that placed the la&s;t in his &s;tation, will not now be enquired. The <HI>fact</HI> is, that <HI>France</HI> is provoked. What the con&s;equences of her re|&s;entment may be, demands our mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>She &s;till believes, that a great body of <HI>American</HI> citizens, re|gards her and the cau&s;e in which &s;he is engaged, with the warm|e&s;t affection. She believes rightly: But it is po&s;&s;ible, and pro|bable too&mdash;that a &s;ingle manoeuvre of our <HI>con&s;tituted authorities</HI> may convince her, that the nation is ho&s;tile to her and her cau&s;e; and this conviction may in&s;tantly &s;nap the thread, by which a naked &s;word is &s;u&s;pended over our head.</P>
<P>SOME MANOEUVRE OF THIS KIND IS MEDITATED: But, a hope is entertained, that even the ob&s;tinacy attendant upon littlene&s;s of genius, &s;o dull in di&s;tingui&s;hing between wi&s;dom and pa&s;&s;ions, the ra&s;hne&s;s of &s;hort-&s;ighted policy, the mouth-filling &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of office-&s;eeking orators, and the blinding vanity of youthful fri|voli&s;ts, that fiddles in declamations amid&s;t the flames of their country, will at length give way to dictates of PRUDENCE, if not of patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>"The film removed"&mdash;"the &s;eat of mental &s;ight" may then perhaps di&s;tinctly di&s;cern the important objects that claim in|&s;tant attention&mdash;</P>
<P>"And, IT HAS MUCH TO SEE."</P>

The Executive Directory have proclaimed their re&s;olution to "CONQUER" <HI>Britain,</HI> and are preparing the means for carrying that re&s;olution into effect.</P>
<P>To the accompli&s;hment of this de&s;ign, the Republic is &s;timu|lated by three of the mo&s;t exciting motives, that ever agitated the mind of a people. Fir&s;t&mdash;to humble a rival, that for many centuries has been formidable and hurtful; and in the revolu|tion, has been the principal in&s;tigator and &s;upporter of the co|alition, that aimed de&s;truction at her territorial integrity and national liberty; and therefore, in her account is ju&s;tly charge|able with all the <HI>French</HI> blood that has been &s;hed, and all the <HI>French</HI> trea&s;ure that has been expended.</P>
<P>Secondly&mdash;to obtain compen&s;ation for the injuries that have been &s;u&s;tained. The va&s;t debts incurred by the Republic, and due to their meritorious armies and other de&s;erving creditiors, mu&s;t be paid, and EITHER BY FRANC OR BRITAIN.</P>
<P>Thirdly&mdash;to extingui&s;n the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> domination over the oceans; thus to become the deliverers of mankind from an oppre&s;&s;ive de&s;poti&s;m on that element, and then by an enlightened and hu|mane policy, to promote permanent peace, and a friendly in|tercour&s;e among&s;t nations, and build their fame and happine&s;s, on the &s;olid foundations of benefactions to the human race.&mdash;There is rea&s;on to believe, that their philanthropy means to ex|tend effectual relief, to tho&s;e outca&s;ts of modern mercies, the weeping&mdash;bleeding children of <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Africa.</HI></P>

<P>In&s;tead of imitating the <HI>Roman</HI> policy, of &s;ettling colonies among conquered nations, to enforce their &s;ubjection, <HI>France</HI> more generou&s;ly and more wi&s;ely, waves her enfranchi&s;ing hand over their heads, and with the voice of power and humanity bids them ri&s;e up FREE STATES.

<P>How much farther the triumphs of benevolence may extend, it is not difficult to fore&s;ee.

<P>The Commerce of <HI>France</HI> may be more exten&s;ive, more benefi|cial, and more firmly fixed, than that of any &s;tate that ever ex|i&s;ted.

<P>However, let us make &s;ome reflections on the fir&s;t que&s;tion.</P>
<P>When <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Carthage</HI> were contending for Empire, if not for &s;afety, <HI>Rome</HI> had no &s;hips of war, and did not know how to build them. <HI>Carthage</HI> had been for ages mi&s;tre&s;s of the &s;eas.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After all her lo&s;&s;es in the two preceding conte&s;ts, <HI>Catha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> at the begin|ning of her <HI>la&s;t</HI> fatal war, alone contained <HI>&s;even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> inhabitants, and ruled over <HI>three buni&s;hed</HI> cities.
<P>How enormous mu&s;t he power have been at the commencement of the <HI>&s;e|cond</HI> or <HI>Hann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">balie</HI> war? What then mu&s;t have been the undaunted courage of <HI>Rome.</HI> that dared to encounter this power? And want her pro&s; and policy. that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">,</HI> &s;he adhered to it, with &s;uch in&s;uperable patience, that after lo&s;ing <HI>&s;even bazdrea</HI> men of war, the at la&s;t prevailed.</P></NOTE> In the conclu&s;ion, after many battles by &s;ea, and a war of more than twenty years continuance, the <HI>Romans</HI> were conquerors at &s;ea, as well as at land. The re&s;ources of the two parties were much nearer to an equality, than tho&s;e of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Britain</HI> now are.</P>
<P>The predece&s;&s;or of <HI>Alfred</HI> the great, "le&s;t his &s;ubjects and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the mo&s;t dangerous and di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances". The afflicted nation &s;eemed likely to peri&s;h: and that truly great Prince was obliged for &s;ome time to conceal him&s;elf from his enemies in deep retirement. At length he left his retreat, and
<PB N="8" REF="033647_0007_0FF7B826D75FB420">had many conflicts with the <HI>Danes,</HI> who covered as it were the neighbouring &s;eas with their fleets, and were continually and cruelly harra&s;&s;ing <HI>England</HI> with inva&s;ions. The King was very &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;advantages his &s;ubjects laboured under, for want of a &s;ufficient fleet to meet their enemies at &s;ea, and pre|vent their landing, and was very de&s;irous of &s;upplying that de|fect.</P>
<P>"But (&s;ays a judicious hi&s;torian) there is nothing in the world more difficult, than to re&s;tore a naval power when it is fallen into decay, in a country where there is little trade, to furni&s;h &s;hips, and to be a nur&s;ery for &s;eamen; and in the face of ene|mies who are ma&s;ters of the &s;ea.

<P>In another place the hi&s;torian takes notice, that "<HI>Alfred,</HI> to oppo&s;e the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Fleets, commanded &s;hips to be built of <HI>a new con&s;truction.</HI> They were of about twice the length of the former, and much more lofty; which made them much &s;wifter &s;ailers, more &s;teady in the water, and not &s;o apt to roll. Some of the&s;e new ve&s;&s;els had &s;ixty oars, and &s;ome even more."</P>
<P>If we compare the <HI>French</HI> with either of the before mentioned powers, it will be found, that they will have much le&s;s difficul|ty to contend with, for obtaining the dominion of the &s;eas, than the <HI>Romans</HI> or <HI>Anglo-Saxons</HI> had.</P>
<P>Let us now turn our attention to the &s;econd que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t reflection that offers it&s;elf to con&s;ideration on this head, is the prodigious di&s;proportion of <HI>population</HI> and <HI>native &s;trength</HI> between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Britain,</HI> not to in&s;i&s;t on the momen|tous addition to that di&s;proportion by the <HI>allies</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> two of the greate&s;t maritime powers in <HI>Europe,</HI> excited as they mu&s;t be to the mo&s;t ardent co-operation with her, by the va&s;t pledges they have dependant on the i&s;&s;ue, and by the proofs &s;he has given in her late negociations, that &s;he contends for <HI>their</HI> inter|acts as pertinaciou&s;ly as for her own&mdash;while <HI>Britain</HI> is left alone.</P>

<P>On the fir&s;t of <HI>November</HI> 1688, <HI>William</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and &s;oon afterwards King of <HI>England,</HI> &s;ailed from <HI>Holland</HI> with a fleet of fifty men of war, twenty five frigates, and as many fire-&s;hips, and near four hundred other ve&s;&s;els.

<P>Several other in&s;tances of &s;uch expeditions made with equal quickne&s;s, might be enumerated. In reality <HI>the Channel</HI> is only a large ferry.</P>
<P>The motives, by which <HI>France</HI> is impelled to an inva&s;ion of <HI>Britain,</HI> are of the mo&s;t imperious nature. They will bring into requi&s;ition not only all her ability and all her diligence, but&mdash;all her genius and all her knowledge.</P>
<P>The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> confe&s;s, that the <HI>French</HI> are perfect ma&s;ters of na|val architecture. If they &s;hall not be able to collect, as &s;oon as they wi&s;h, a &s;ufficient number of men of war, to protect an army in its pa&s;&s;age, probably they will &s;upply that deficiency, by building &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting fortre&s;&s;es as the world has never yet &s;een: for, their actions in other re&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cks, have tran&s;cended all former examples of human archievement.</P>
<P>The prize at which they now aim, is in their eyes too ine&s;ti|mable to be abandoned. The greatne&s;s of ob&s;tacles and &s;uffer|ings
<PB N="11" REF="033647_0010_0FF7B839D8A9A8E0">will enhance its value. It is in their opinion, con&s;ecrated by the blood of their fellow-citizens that has been poured out in the cau&s;e. They will not think <HI>any thing</HI> that <HI>has been</HI> gained, is commen&s;urate to their rights or intere&s;ts. To leave <HI>Britain</HI> reigning on any element, will in their e&s;timation be ingratitude to their brethren who are no more, and trea&s;on again&s;t their po&s;terity. The old <HI>Roman</HI> denunciation, "DELINDA EST CAR|THAGO," rings from the <HI>Rhine</HI> to the <HI>Pyrennees,</HI> and from the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> to the <HI>Ocean.</HI></P>
<P>Surely, it is within the bounds of probability, that wooden fortre&s;&s;es may be con&s;tructed, mounting &s;uch artillery as no fir&s;t-rate can oppo&s;e with &s;ucce&s;s. Unincumbered with ma&s;ts &s;ails and other rigging, and therefore drawing le&s;s water, and capable of carrying more artillery, a &s;ufficient celerity may be given to their motion, if towed by gallies driven forward with the united force of &s;ails and oars, e&s;pecially if it be con&s;idered, that for &s;e|veral months in every year, the <HI>Channel</HI> is very &s;mooth. It is likely, that <HI>Alfred</HI>'s &s;hips of <HI>"a new con&s;truction"</HI> before men|tioned, were as extraordinary in his age, as &s;uch fortre&s;&s;es would be now.</P>
<P>A knowledge of all nautical circum&s;tances, will enable the planners of inva&s;ion, to calculate exactly the time that will be re|quired for the arrival of the armament on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. Proper per&s;ons rai&s;ed up in baloons, and furni&s;hed with the be&s;t gla&s;&s;es, may di&s;cern every ve&s;&s;el within &s;ight to a va&s;t di&s;tance. The po&s;&s;ibility and quantity of any re&s;i&s;tance by them, can then be preci&s;ely a&s;certained. If intelligence from places more re|mote is wanted, telegraphs can dart it, with any requi&s;ite ve|locity.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch,</HI> in his life of <HI>Demetrius Poliorcetes,</HI> &s;ays&mdash;"His great diverti&s;ement was in building gallies, and inventing engines of war; and having naturally a genius addicted to mechanics, he did not apply it to making u&s;ele&s;s toys, after the humour of &s;ome other princes, who &s;pent their vacant hours in painting, mu&s;ic, or turning, &amp;c."&mdash;"But, the mechanic inventions of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> tho' de&s;igned for u&s;e and &s;ervice, had &s;omething noble and mag|nificent withall; and the wonderful contrivance of them was &s;o uncommon, that one might ea&s;ily read the character of <HI>a great mind</HI> and <HI>extraordinary genius</HI> in the artifice. They were &s;uch, as by their &s;tructure be&s;poke them&s;elves the product of a &s;ove|reign engineer, in&s;omuch that they did not le&s;s &s;urprize his friends with their &s;tupendous magnificence, than they a&s;toni&s;hed his enemies by their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI> It is no le&s;s remarkable than true, what is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that the very enemies again&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="033647_0011_0FF7B83D9B2A25B8">whom they were to be employed for their de&s;truction, could not forbear running to gaze with admiration upon his gallies of five and &s;ix ranges of oars, as they pa&s;&s;ed near their coa&s;ts; and the inhabitants of tho&s;e cities that were to be be&s;ieged and &s;tormed by tho&s;e terrible engines, thronged to the walls which they were about to batter, to behold tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> machines"&mdash;"Even <HI>Ly|&s;imachus,</HI> of all the kings of his time the greate&s;t enemy of <HI>De|metrius,</HI> coming to rai&s;e the &s;iege of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">os</HI> in <HI>Cilicia,</HI> &s;ent to de&s;ire to &s;ee his gallies and engines, which <HI>Demetrius</HI> readily granted. <HI>Ly&s;imachus</HI> having gratified his curio&s;ity by a full view of them, &s;truck at once with fear and admiration, quitted the place, and his de&s;ign of relieving the be&s;ieged city."</P>
<P>The contemplation of &s;uch facts as have been mentioned, &s;hould teach, it is pre&s;umed, not to be over-confident, in de|ciding upon the enterprizes of great minds, animated by the &s;tronge&s;t excitements, and &s;upported by a prodigious accumu|lation of power, in a rapid progre&s;&s;ion of aggrandizement.</P>
<P>Our di&s;qui&s;itions concerning the final event of the conte&s;t be|tween <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> can have no influence upon that conte&s;t; but, a ju&s;t regard for our own peace and welfare, calls upon us to reflect, that the event MAY BE di&s;a&s;trous to the la&s;t.</P>
