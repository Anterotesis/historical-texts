<HEAD>MEDICAL ADVICE TO SEAMEN; WITH <HI>DIRECTIONS</HI> FOR A <HI>MEDICINE CHEST.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SEAFARING people are that cla&s;s of mankind who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be in perfect health when they en|rol them&s;elves for any particular voyage or crui&s;e; not|with&s;tanding their hardine&s;s, they are liable to many and numerous excruciating maladies, during the pro&s;e|cution of their re&s;pective voyages to different parts of the world: Whatever, therefore has a tendency to meliorate, or render comfortable the &s;ituation of the &s;ick on board of ve&s;&s;els, mu&s;t be an acqui&s;ition truly important and u&s;eful to all navigators. I &s;hall there|fore, by way of preface to the directions for a &s;ea medicine che&s;t, offer &s;ome general outlines on the ap|pearance and management of the principal di&s;ea&s;es which occur to &s;eamen in different voyages and places. It has been a common practice to put up medicine che&s;ts, with directions containing the do&s;es and virtues

This cannot be of much &s;ervice to the people, unle&s;s the ma&s;ter or pre&s;criber has a pre|vious knowledge of di&s;ea&s;es, or is a per&s;on of judgment &s;ufficient to di&s;cern the character of the di&s;ea&s;e, and thereby judge what particular indication is be&s;t &s;uited remove it.</P>
<P>Many &s;ick people at &s;ea have &s;uffered much, and had their complaint prolonged, in con&s;equence of a too frequent, and often oppo&s;ite repetition of medicines; this is in con&s;equence of the &s;imilarity there is in the &s;ymptoms of many di&s;ea&s;es, which in their re&s;pective natures, are diametrically oppo&s;ite, and which, without &s;ome general rule or guide, no man can make a nece&s;|&s;ary di&s;tinction. The &s;hort &s;y&s;tem which I here pre|&s;ent, will be brief and conci&s;e; at the &s;ame time con|taining an illu&s;tration of circum&s;tances, nece&s;&s;ary to mark the general characteri&s;tic, on which mo&s;t of the di&s;ea&s;es incident to &s;eamen, depend. Whereby the ma&s;ter may know on what grounds to pre&s;cribe his me|dicines, and how he may judge of their effects, and con|duct his applications through all the variety of &s;ymp|toms that occur, in general di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Sailors are very apt to be carele&s;s of their health, e&s;pecially while in port, and expo&s;e them&s;elves to every intemperance that can po&s;&s;ibly produce the occa&s;ional cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es. It is therefore incumbent on the ma&s;ter to watch his people clo&s;ely, while under his care; and when &s;ick, to make faithful inve&s;tigation re&s;pecting their conduct and habits, during a number of days before the arrival of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ALL GENERAL DISEASES ARE DIVIDED INTO FOUR ORDERS,</HI> viz:&mdash; FEVERS, INFLAMMATIONS, FLUXES, AND DISEASES OF WEAKNESS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="disease">
<HEAD>ORDER I. <HI>FEVERS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FEVERS, comprehend all tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which are attended with the following &s;ymptoms: viz. the patient complains fir&s;t of a dull pain in the back and limbs, weakne&s;s of the joints, e&s;pecially of the knees, a heavy pain, load, and di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations at the &s;tomach, with a natural aver&s;ion to move about or exerci&s;e; a yawning, &s;tretching, &amp;c. &s;ucceeded by &s;light cold chills, flying through the body, head ach, &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, the eye looks dull and heavy, &s;ometimes very red and prominent, as the cold chill advances the &s;kin is pale and &s;hrivelled; the&s;e &s;ymptoms are next &s;ucceeded by heats throughout the body, with the ap|pearance of enlarged veins, quick, hard and laborious pul&s;e, &s;triking from 70 to 100 &s;trokes in a minute,
<PB N="6" REF="047482_0005_1023B4B0DAC3EDC0">
&s;ometimes the pul&s;e feels &s;mall, quick and trembling; &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, &s;ometimes occa&s;ions violent vo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">, and &s;ometimes purgings; the patient is unea&s;y and re&s;tle&s;s, but complains of no particular pain except in the head, which &s;ometimes occa&s;ions deliriums, a wildne&s;s, and incoherent &s;peaking, pulling and hauling the bed cloaths, &amp;c. The&s;e &s;ymptoms continue 6 or 8 hours, when they abate a little, but return again to|wards night with their former violence, and continue to ob&s;erve the&s;e periods until the 9th, 11th, 14th, and &s;ometimes run on to the 20th and 24th day of the di&s;|ea&s;e, before a &s;olution terminates either in death or health. The&s;e different periods of the di&s;ea&s;e vary ac|cording to the climate, &s;tate of the patient's con&s;titu|tion, nature of the reigning di&s;ea&s;es of the place, and a variety of circum&s;tances which often &s;horten or lengthen a fever: It is to be ob&s;erved that different people with different con&s;titutions will be differently affected with the &s;ame fever. Some are attacked with all the above mentioned &s;ymptoms, with violent vomitings of black matter, and bleeding at the no&s;e, eyes and gums; others with the &s;ame fever, in the &s;ame place and ve&s;&s;el, have all tho&s;e &s;ymptoms mild, and a very clear head, with quiet &s;tomach and bowels; others again are &s;eized with violent heat and pains in the head and bones, and con|tinue in the greate&s;t tortures two or three days, and die &s;udden. The&s;e la&s;t circum&s;tances depend on the man|ner of living; to frequent intoxication, and being late out in night air fogs, lying on deck evenings; carou&s;ing in hot, clo&s;e hou&s;es, and &s;uddenly going into the air; the nature of the prevailing &s;ickne&s;s in port; being in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;till rivers, canals, mar&s;hy places, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

from a foul and weakened &s;tomach, bad provi&s;ions, &amp;c. &amp;c. and many get fevers from their own carele&s;&s;ne&s;s or negligence, as has been before mentioned; but they are all cured much in the &s;ame manner; va|rying the modes in proportion to the violent &s;ymptoms of the fever pre&s;ent.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="cure">
<HEAD>METHOD OF CURE.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER having examined the patient's con&s;titution, his habits of living, and the &s;tate of his &s;tomach and bowels; and whether tho&s;e &s;ymptoms mentioned above, are actually pre&s;ent, the judgment will dictate what particular evacuation will be mo&s;t proper. If the &s;ick|ne&s;s at &s;tomach, with vomiting of bile, is the mo&s;t pre|valent, it will be proper to give a vomit, No. 1. and after the operation is fini&s;hed, if the heat, thir&s;t, quick pul&s;e, and &s;ymptoms of fever continue to rage, blood letting mu&s;t be had recour&s;e to, drawn freely, and re|peated as the &s;ymptoms require, having regard to the robu&s;t habit of the patient, &amp;c. It is to be remem|bered, that we cannot be too free with the lancet in many climates, e&s;pecially in the We&s;t-Indies, and in our &s;outhern &s;tates, among the fevers incident to tho&s;e cli|mates; after bleeding, a purge, No. 3. is to be given, and &s;hould it not operate largely, it mu&s;t be repeated again. The&s;e three general evacuations are only to be depended upon in the cure of fevers, and mu&s;t be re|peated as the &s;ymptoms of fever and violence of the complaint indicate. For drink, the fever julep, No. 18. may be taken often, by mixing it with water, barley tea cold, beverage, lemonade water, or fifteen or twenty drops of No. 10. mixed with a pint of water, may be

a drink con&s;tantly, and is very proper in hot climates, where putrefaction is to be dreaded; crem. Tartar water, &amp;c. The patient mu&s;t be kept cool, and &s;uffered to breathe pure air.</P>
<P>If notwith&s;tanding the exhibition of the&s;e general indications of <HI>vomiting, bleeding, purging,</HI> and <HI>cooling,</HI> the fever &s;hould run on till it terminates in a putrid, di&s;&s;olved &s;tate of the blood, which is known by an abate|ment of all pains or unea&s;ine&s;s; a black, dry tongue, with a yellow &s;treak acro&s;s the middle of it; &s;tinking breath, and weakening, clammy &s;weats, hollow eyes, blood &s;tarting from the gums, no&s;e, bowels, and the recovery of his &s;en&s;es, you mu&s;t lay a&s;ide all tho&s;e cool|ing medicines, and give freely of No. 4. No. 11. brandy, wine, and wa&s;h the patient freely in good &s;pirits and vinegar, keeping his cabin well ventilated, &amp;c. But in this &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s it will be proper to have the advice of a phy&s;ician.</P>

<HEAD>ORDER IV. <HI>DISEASES</HI> OF <HI>WEAKNESS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH they do not frequently occur at &s;ea, yet many times &s;eamen are liable to lingering di&s;ea&s;es, which require &s;ome of the ma&s;ter's &s;kill; &s;uch as <HI>&s;curvy, drop&s;ical &s;wellings, intermitting fevers, colics, rheuma|ti&s;ms</HI> without fever, <HI>jaundice,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Scurvy</HI> is cured by taking ten or fourteen drops of No. 10. in water, three times a day, eating fruit vege|tables, drinking lemonade, and if there are any &s;curvy &s;ores, and &s;pongy, they mu&s;t be cut out with a lancet, and dre&s;&s;ed with line, and &s;alve, No. 7.</P>
