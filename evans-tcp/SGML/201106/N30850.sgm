<P>SINCE Vi&s;ion and Prophecy are &s;ealed up, and no Man has Liberty to add any Thing to the Words of the Book of the Revelation of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> all Dreams, Omens, Signs, Tokens, pretended Vi&s;ions, and Revelations, or any kind of Progno&s;tications what&s;oever, and Ob&s;erva|tions upon them, are to be e&s;teemed nothing at all but Delu&s;ions of the Devil; whereby the Prince of Darkne&s;s deceives weak Minds, who are &s;eeking more after the Chaff than the Wheat.</P>
<P>But tho' the mo&s;t High God &s;everely reproves all &s;uch as pretend to Predictions or Knowledge of Secrets, by Interpretations of Dreams; yet as Men dream, they may lawfully tell their Dreams to one another, without any De&s;ign to deceive by them. I &s;hall therefore take Liberty to relate the following one.</P>
<P>I fancied my&s;elf travelling in the Ea&s;tern Parts of the World; and, at la&s;t, coming to the City
<PB N="4" REF="040891_0004_101A0B95DA8F02E0">of <HI>Old Babylon,</HI> where I was much amu&s;ed in view|ing the Curio&s;ities of the Place, as the Tower, the Wall, the Gates, the Streets, the Palace, the River, the Images in the Plain of <HI>Dura, &amp;c.</HI> I ob&s;erved the City, and it appeared in different Views. In one Part the People were entirely taken up in Re|vellings, Fea&s;tings, Diver&s;ions, &s;plendid Appearan|ces, and enjoying them&s;elves. In the other Part they were more re&s;erved, and were much taken up in a demure Dre&s;s and Behaviour; in the Decency of their Hou&s;es and Streets, and in the Regularity of their Towers and Fortifications, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But without any Appearance of Dangers, Alarms, or Mole&s;ta|tions, they &s;eemed all entirely at Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Howbeit, when I had almo&s;t &s;atiated my&s;elf with gazing at the particular Shows; I thought to take a Pro&s;pect of the whole City together. So I walk'd to a ri&s;ing Ground belonging to it, but a little retired from the Croud; where I &s;aw a Booth, which I took to be built on purpo&s;e for the Conveniency of taking Pro&s;pects, and I went directly to it; and at the Door I &s;aw an old Man, of whom I enquir'd if he had ever a Pro&s;pect-Gla&s;s, whereby I might be favour'd with a full View of that royal City, which I &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Me|tropolis of the World. He told me if I plea&s;ed to take a deliberate Ob&s;ervation, I might perhaps have different Apprehen&s;ions of that &s;plendid City, than I had at pre&s;ent. For he a&s;&s;ured me it was &s;o full of inte&s;tine Perplexity, cau&s;ed by Envy, Malice, Exce&s;s, and Corruption, that the Inhabitants had no real Satisfaction in them&s;elves; and it was only by tho&s;e Extravagancies and Amu&s;ements which
<PB N="5" REF="040891_0005_101A0B97A24A1B50">had &s;een, they kept them&s;elves from perpetual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;traction. He then fetch'd out his Pro|tective, and told me if I pleas'd he would &s;hew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the Situation of the Place; whereby I might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e convinc'd that its Condition was not &s;o happy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or its Glory &s;o maje&s;tick as I imagined. So I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ook a di&s;tinct View on the South Side; and the Foundation of the Place appeared to be built upon nothing but Bogs and Quick-&s;ands, which could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;u&s;tain the Buildings; but ere long they mu&s;t inevitably &s;ink. I again took a View on the North Side; and I found the Foundation was all bituminous and &s;ulphurous Matter, inter&s;pers'd with &s;ubterraneous Fire, which appeared ready in a Moment to break forth into Flames. He then bid me look to the Ea&s;t; and I &s;aw a very formi|dable Army approaching the City, with full Power and Commi&s;&s;ion to de&s;troy it; and they &s;pread them&s;elves around with Fury, like the roaring of the Sea. And there was a Trembling upon all the Hills, the Rivers, the Trees, and all the Fields round about; but all the Inhabitants of the City continued in a Stupefaction.</P>
<P>When I had beheld and deliberated on the&s;e Things, it filled me with &s;uch A&s;toni&s;hment as almo&s;t cau&s;ed my Bowels to turn within me. Such was my Di&s;appointment, and the Horror that &s;eized me, that I thought I was neither able to bear the Sight, nor fly from i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, nor &s;tand my Ground. And I a&s;ked the old Man if I might lodge all Night in that Booth. But he told me it was not a Place for Lodging, nor would any Per|&s;on in his right Mind think it &s;afe to &s;leep &s;o near
<PB N="6" REF="040891_0006_101A0B99451CD298">the City; but if I pleas'd, I might come in and re&s;t my&s;elf a little. And when I enter'd, I found four young Men very carefully peru&s;ing a Map; &s;eeming to make very particular Remarks, and dili|gent Ob&s;ervations, and would &s;ome times earne&s;tly enquire the old Man's Judgment, to inform them of the Meaning of &s;ome Things. Whereupon I enquired what Piece it was that &s;o much attracted their Attention. They told me it was the Map of <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>Canaan,</HI> with all the Roads between the two Places. And they having had a full Pro&s;pect of the &s;ame Things which I had ju&s;t now be|held; and being determined to leave their native Country, and travel to the latter Place, was the Rea&s;on of their pre&s;ent Enquiries. And the old Man being a native of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and acquainted with both Countries, as well as the Roads from one to the other, they frequently applied to him for In&s;truction in Things difficult.</P>
<P>The&s;e four young Men appeared &s;o like each other in their Apparel, their Speech, and Beha|viour, as well as &s;ome of their Features, that I verily took them all to have been own brothers; and knew not any thing to the contrary, until I became acquainted with a certain Per&s;on who had &s;ome Knowledge of the Places where they were born, and of the Regi&s;ter-books. He informed me that two of them were Sons of the Bond-Woman, but the other two were Sons of the Free-Woman.</P>
<P>So I ob&s;erved them, and they all made Prepara|tion with &s;eeming vigorous Re&s;olution for their propo&s;ed Journey. And among&s;t other Con&s;ulta|tions
<PB N="7" REF="040891_0007_101A0B9AF3890610">with the old Man (their In&s;tructor) they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arne&s;tly crav'd his Advice, whether it were ex|pedient for each of them to take along with him a Female Companion? Which he very chearfully encourag'd them to do, provided they were &s;uch as were di&s;pos'd to go the &s;ame Way, and had their Hearts engaged to &s;eek the &s;ame Country along with them. But otherwi&s;e he admoni&s;hed them (by all Means) to avoid &s;uch Companions as had no Knowledge of or Delight in the Way they de&s;igned to travel.</P>
<P>He pointed out to them many Difficulties in the Way where the Company of Strangers would be of very dangerous Con&s;equence; told them the Need they would find of &s;trengthening and encour|aging in the Way, rather than hindering and di&s;|couraging; and rea&s;on'd much upon the Evil that would attend (in many Re&s;pects) &s;uch Com|panions as took no Delight in the Way; and com|pared it with the Advantages they might expect in the Company of &s;uch as took Plea&s;ure, and would endeavour to animate them therein. He further informed them in many In&s;tances, what bad Effects Travellers, who had formerly gone that Way, had found from di&s;agreable Companions. And that (to prevent the like Inconveniencies) the King of the Country had made a Law that none of his Subjects &s;hould join with Strangers to be Companions in that Journey. And therefore he earne&s;tly caution'd (whatever they did) to be ex|ceeding careful in their Choice.</P>
<P>I waited to &s;ee what Influence this Advice would have upon the Minds of the&s;e young Men.
<PB N="8" REF="040891_0006_101A0B99451CD298">But I ob&s;erv'd, that (at the fir&s;t) none of them &s;eem'd to reli&s;h his Coun&s;el; for they had all either contracted &s;ome Acquaintance with, or placed their Fancy upon Maids who were Natives of <HI>Ba|bylon,</HI> to whom their Hearts were very inclinable. But the more they appeared engaged in their Af|fections, the more their In&s;tructor in&s;i&s;ted on the Dangers and pernicious Con&s;equences which were mo&s;t certain to attend their having &s;uch Com|panions. And withal told them the King had ap|pointed one to attend them in their Journey, who&s;e Name was <HI>Self-Denial,</HI> without who&s;e Company it would be impo&s;&s;ible ever to reach the Borders of <HI>Canaan.</HI> And that to chu&s;e a Stranger for a Com|panion, would be &s;uch an In&s;ult to him (at the fir&s;t &s;etting out) as might cau&s;e Mi&s;under&s;tanding all the Way. For his Part, he told them, that to pretend to travel to <HI>Canaan,</HI> and to choo&s;e a <HI>Baby|lonia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> or a Companion, was &s;uch a Contradiction, that he could not but very much doubt the Sin|cerity of their Hearts. For if it was po&s;&s;ible at all for a &s;incere Traveller to choo&s;e &s;uch a Compan|ion; (as he would not be too bold in his A&s;&s;er|tions) yet he was very certain it could not be &s;o long as they continued in the right U&s;e of their Rea&s;on. And he mu&s;t di&s;charge his Con&s;cience in giving them timely Admonition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I ob&s;erved the Event of the&s;e Con&s;ultations; and I found the elde&s;t Son of the Bond-Woman could not be moved by all the&s;e Arguments. But re&s;olutely cho&s;e one who was an utter Stranger to the Paths, nor hall any Delight or De&s;ire thereto. And when he had covenanted with her, &s;he
<PB N="9" REF="040891_0006_101A0B99451CD298">proved &s;o aver&s;e to going along with him, and &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uctant to his pur&s;uing his intended Journey, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at &s;he prevailed upon him to de&s;i&s;t from his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rpo&s;e. So he &s;ettled with her in <HI>Babylon;</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ey were both there when the City was de&s;troy'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d peri&s;hed together in the Ruins.</P>
<P>But the younger Brother (Son of the Bond-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oman) took a little more Regard to the Coun&s;el <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ven him, and &s;eemed more heedful in his Choice; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d (in a &s;light Manner) &s;ought to get a Compani|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n that would be willing to go along with him. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o at la&s;t he met with one who appeared complia|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e to his De&s;ire, though &s;he had no knowledge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Way, nor any De&s;ire to it, only it &s;eemed a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atter indifferent; and therefore as he was incli|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to undertake the Journey, &s;he would conde|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">end to compliment him with her Company. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his plea&s;ed the young Man very well, as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ought he &s;hould both gratify him&s;elf in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hoice of a Companion, and al&s;o act conformable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his Directions.

And this manner
<PB N="10" REF="040891_0007_101A0B9AF3890610">of loitering prevailed more and more, until at la&s;t they came to a low Valley, by the Brink of the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> where they turned a&s;ide and fell a&s;leep; and while they &s;lept, there aro&s;e a Swell in the River, and the Flood &s;wept them both away.</P>
<P>As for the younger Son of the Free-Woman, when he had heard the Admonitions, they made &s;ome deep Impre&s;&s;ions upon his Mind, and fill'd him with &s;ome awful Apprehen&s;ions. For he was convinced of the pernicious Con&s;equences, which would attend &s;uch Company, and appear'd very &s;olicitous to avoid them. But (how it was, I have now forgotten, whether before the&s;e Con&s;iderati|ons, he had contracted a Corre&s;pondence, and had not Re&s;olution to deny him&s;elf; or whether after|wards, by Dalliance, and giving Latitude to his Fancy, he forgot him&s;elf) &s;ome Way or other, he prov'd to be entangled with a Daughter of the <HI>Chaldees:</HI> which betwixt the In&s;tructions he had receiv'd, and his own unguarded Affections, caus'd &s;ome Strugglings in his Mind. For though the Per&s;on was of a complacent Di&s;po&s;ition; and did not &s;eem at all reluctant to the Things he had in View; yet he plainly perceiv'd, &s;he had no real Ta&s;te to them; and that her innate Di&s;po&s;ition was more to <HI>Babylon</HI> than <HI>Canaan.</HI> She had never been convinced of the Mi&s;ery and Ruin approaching her native Country; nor had &s;he ever been ac|quainted with the Plea&s;ures, and Delights of that Land which he was &s;eeking after; nor had &s;he any De&s;ire to the Way. But his &s;trong Inclination &s;timulated him to rea&s;on upon every Thing in the
<PB N="11" REF="040891_0007_101A0B9AF3890610">mo&s;t advantageous and promi&s;ing Light; and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the mo&s;t favourable Con&s;truction upon every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">cum&s;tance, as thus; "That her Complacence was &s;uch that &s;he would not be any Hinderance, or Mole&s;tation to him.

That tho&s;e En|gagements which he &s;hould enter into with her, were of another Nature; and might be perform|ed without interfering immediately with the Concerns of his Journey. That it was very hard to be prohibited from the Enjoyment of one, who (in all other Re&s;pects) appeared &s;o de&s;irable. And that probably he might never find a Companion compleat in every point, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hort, the young Man per&s;i&s;ted in the&s;e kinds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Rea&s;oning, until he had almo&s;t &s;tupified his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">en&s;es.

Until at length a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;olute Pa&s;&s;ion prevailed, &s;o far that his Eyes were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rkned, and he &s;carce perceived the Day from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight. And during this Ob&s;truction of his Sen&s;es; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> went one Evening, after both Sun and Moon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere gone down; and joined Hands with this <HI>Ba|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ylonian.</HI> But when the Sun aro&s;e in the Morning, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d he was a little come to him&s;elf, he then be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me &s;en&s;ible of the Ra&s;hne&s;s of his Adventure; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut it was too late to recall it.

<P>So after &s;ome anxious Thoughts and bitter Re|flections, he endeavoured to &s;mother his Grief as well as he could, and betook him&s;elf to his Jou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ney; exerting his utmo&s;t Skill, and Power, to take his Companion along with him. But alas, when he attempted to lead her into the Way, he found &s;he had no Feet; &s;he could not move a Step further than he mu&s;t carry her; and a heavy Bur|then &s;he proved. So I ob&s;erved &s;ome of his Tra|vel. And when he met with Dangers, Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, or Di&s;appointments, he would begin to expre&s;s his Grief, and to unbo&s;om his Mind to his Companion; but &s;he had no Ears, no Under&s;tanding, nor Heart to &s;ympathize with him; nor was &s;he ca|pable of being made to know the Nature of his Complaints. If he was be&s;et with Robbers, wild Bea&s;ts, Serpents, or any Annoyance, he would &s;ometimes make his Complaint to her; but &s;he could neither a&s;&s;i&s;t, nor comfort him. If he want|ed Direction in any Part of his Way; &s;he could not give him any Coun&s;el. If he was &s;ick, or wound|ed, and wanted Cordials, or Oil for his Wounds, &s;he had no Hands to admini&s;ter any Relief. And as &s;he never was capable of yielding him any Suc|cour, or Comfort in his Sufferings, neither was &s;he ever capable of partaking of any of his Enjoyments. If he met with any Gardens of Spices, or refre&s;h|ing Springs by the Way, he would offer her to eat, or drink with him; but &s;he had no Ta&s;te. If he found &s;weet Flowers, he would pluck, and
<PB N="13" REF="040891_0008_101A0B9DCE484BB8">give them to her; but &s;he had no Smell, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uld have any Delight in them.

For though it was not in his Power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o find any Thing in his Way that would divert <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r influence her Mind; yet &s;he frequently found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut &s;omething in her own Path which did divert <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd in&s;en&s;ibly draw away his Heart, by which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as many times entangled and laden with thick Clay.</P>
<P>Another Thing I ob&s;erved, that after he had be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">un his Journey, the King of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> (who&s;e Subject

But the Performance of this Command was ren|dered impracticable; for as he in&s;tructed them to go right, &s;he induced them to wander; as he en|deavoured to gather them, &s;he &s;cattered them; and as he fed them with whole&s;ome Food, &s;he would &s;urfeit them with poi&s;onous Herbs. So, which Way the King di&s;po&s;ed of them afterwards, I never knew; but they never pro&s;pered under his Care.</P>
<P>Thus her Company never yielded him the lea&s;t Benefit or A&s;&s;i&s;tance, through his whole Journey; but was an Allay to all his Joys, and an Aggrava|tion to all his Sorrows. And it frequently cau&s;ed him very much Regret of Mind, to think of his own unadvi&s;ed Engagement; and of the much Neglect in Duty, Wandering, and lo&s;t Time, which it had been the Occa&s;ion of to him; as well as to ob&s;erve, the wretched Stupefaction of her Mind, which was incapable of &s;haring in any of his ble&s;&s;ed Enjoyments; or of being affected with any of his Calamities. In&s;omuch as it turned his plea&s;ant Journey, into a weari&s;ome Travel, through a lone|&s;ome Wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>But at la&s;t (through many dull Hours, Fatigues, and tire&s;ome Steps) he arrived near the Borders of the Land, upon the Bank of the River <HI>Jordan;</HI> where (in the mid&s;t of the Stream) he beheld a Man in a rich prie&s;tly Ve&s;ture &s;tanding to &s;top the Torrent, till he was pa&s;&s;ed over, which made him approach the River, exceedingly tran&s;ported with

<P><HI>A.</HI> A Per&s;on may be accompli&s;hed with all the Refinements, Improvements, and Excellencies of <HI>Babylon,</HI> &s;o as to appear &s;uperior to many of the Citizens; but if the&s;e be only the Accommodations of their own Country, they can only make a gra|dual Difference between them and the mo&s;t abject Pea&s;ants; whereas there is nece&s;&s;arily a &s;pecifical Difference between a <HI>Babylonian</HI> and an <HI>I&s;raelite.</HI></P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> The King of Glory denies nothing that is good, therefore if it were really good, it would not be denied me; he only denies us tho&s;e Things which he knows would be evil, and it is a real Kindne&s;s to us to be denied of them.

<P><HI>A.</HI> Have I any Rea&s;on to expect to be made happy by a Per&s;on who is an utter Stranger to tho&s;e Things wherein my Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts? Or can I expect to find U&s;efulne&s;s in this Way, from that which cannot be enjoyed or obtained without going out of the Way? Be&s;ide, whatever Qualifi|cations &s;he is endued with, or however valuable Accommodations &s;he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, it never will be her Inclination to employ tho&s;e Excellencies to a&s;&s;i&s;t others in a Way which &s;he her&s;elf hath no Delight in.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But &s;eeing her Di&s;po&s;ition is &s;o agreeably complai&s;ant, and her Mind &s;o well qualified with natural Virtues, and decorated with &s;o many acquir'd Ornaments; is there any Rea&s;on to doubt but that a Per&s;on thus prepared will have a Ta&s;te for learn|ing and embracing the be&s;t Things? And may I not therefore expect to be an In&s;trument to engage her Mind to walk the ble&s;&s;ed way?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> All the Accompli&s;hments that a Per&s;on can po&s;&s;ibly receive from <HI>Babylon,</HI> can never prepare, qualify, nor di&s;po&s;e them for travelling to <HI>Canaan;</HI> nor will it by any Means induce or incline any Per|&s;on to receive the real Knowledge or Love of that Country. Therefore tho&s;e who are not powerfully called by the King's Commandment, and inwardly attracted by a vital Influence, can never be engaged by any other Motive or Per&s;ua&s;ion what&s;oever. For there is nothing in the Nature of a <HI>Babylonian</HI> (without the Inchoation of new Principles) that is capable of Attraction. But the more excellent her
<PB N="19" REF="040891_0011_101A0BA35C4EE320">Accompli&s;hments are, the more &s;trongly her Mind will be cemented to that Climate from whence &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eceived them. And on the other Hand, as I for|merly was a <HI>Babylonian,</HI> (though now ble&s;&s;ed with new Principles) the old Tincture &s;till remains in my Nature, which (like &s;o much Tinder) is ready <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o kindle with every Spark of <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> Fire. Wherefore the greater Excellencies &s;he is embel|li&s;hed with, the greater Influence it will have to draw me a&s;ide into her Paths, and &s;o put me in perpetual Danger. For of this I am infallibly a&s;|&s;ured, that they will draw away one's Heart.</P>
<P>When he had thus rea&s;oned with him&s;elf, he made a full Pau&s;e; and appeared in a &s;trong Agi|tation of Mind; and a Palene&s;s aro&s;e in his Face. And I heard him &s;igh, and &s;ay to him&s;elf, <Q>Whi|ther has my Mind been roving!</Q> And trem|bling, he lift up his Eyes to Heaven; and earne&s;tly cryed, <Q>O God of all Grace, deliver me from Temptation!</Q> And from that Time, he never would regard any of the Dam&s;els of the City. But &s;aid, He would wait till he &s;hould find a true Com|panion; and till then he would walk alone.</P>
<P>So he went on his Way, rejoicing that he had e&s;caped the Snare; and carrying along with him, this Motto, "The Lord is my Portion;" enjoying great Satisfaction in his own Mind; &s;aying to him|&s;elf, If my King &s;ees it good for me to walk alone, I know he will ble&s;s that State unto me; but if it be for my good to enjoy a Companion, I know his Goodne&s;s will provide one for me, without my going out of the Way to find one.</P>

But as he was thus going on his Way, he ob&s;er|ved a young Virgin, who was walking the &s;ame Road; and he begun to de&s;ire to be favoured with her Company; but thought it advi&s;able to be very deliberate; becau&s;e many &s;eem to walk the &s;ame Road, which only go Part of the Way, and then turn off into &s;ome other Path. Therefore he diligently ob&s;erved, whether &s;he clo&s;ely attended to the right Way. So he perceived her to take &s;omething out of her Bo&s;om, and diligently peru&s;e it for a while, and then put it into her Bo&s;om a|gain, and pur&s;ue the &s;treight Path; whereupon he went up to her, and enquired where &s;he was bound. She told him &s;he was &s;etting her Face towards <HI>Zion.</HI> He a&s;ked her, what it was &s;he had been peru&s;ing? And &s;he &s;hewed him, that it was the Map of the Road; which &s;he took along with her, for her Guide. He then began to enquire further who &s;he was, and whence &s;he came; &s;he told him, &s;he was by Birth a <HI>Chaldean;</HI> by Education and Conver&s;ation a <HI>Babylonian;</HI> but the King of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had &s;ent for her, to go forth to &s;eek a better Coun|try. He al&s;o a&s;ked, what Expectations, or En|couragement &s;he had, in taking &s;uch a Journey? &s;he told him, &s;he had the King's Word, to make her an Inhabitant in his royal Palace, when &s;he arrived at the upper <HI>Bethel;</HI> and to grant her &s;uf|ficient Defence, and Su&s;tenance, all the Way thi|ther. He a&s;ked, if &s;he could be fully &s;atisfied in the King's Veracity? &s;he told him the Frauds, and Jealou&s;ies of <HI>Babylon,</HI> had made &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions upon her Mind; that &s;he had found it very diffi|cult to believe him that could not lie; but his
<PB N="21" REF="040891_0012_101A0BA59C5762E8">Maje&s;ty had conde&s;cended to give her the &s;tronge&s;t Demon&s;trations of his Fidelity; &s;o that now &s;he was convinced, &s;he had no Rea&s;on to doubt his Goodne&s;s, for he had confirmed his Promi&s;e with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Oath, and had given her to &s;ee, that in his own Records, it was &s;ealed with Blood; and the Coun|ter-Part he had written upon her Brea&s;t, and &s;eal|ed it in Characters of Life; and hitherto, &s;he had found his Word verified to her, in &s;trongly defend|ing, and abundantly &s;upplying her; &s;o that &s;he could &s;et to her Seal, that he was true. Then, &s;he al&s;o a&s;ked him divers Que&s;tions, relating to his Travels, and Enjoyments; and he likewi&s;e an|&s;wered her, in a free and &s;atisfactory Manner. So that their Affections began to grow warm towards one another: It was a very comfortable Interview; and their Minds were refre&s;hed by each other's Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>And they appeared &s;o agreable one to another, that he began to think they might be plea&s;ant &amp; pro|fitable Companions all the Way. But fir&s;t, he retired for a while, to deliberate on the Conver&s;ation that had pa&s;&s;ed already. When the more he thought of her Diligence, in the Pur&s;uit of her Journey; and her fixed Satisfaction concerning the End of it; her Under&s;tanding in tho&s;e Things laid down in the Map, for guiding her in the Way, and the Delight &s;he appeared to take in meditating on, and con|ver&s;ing about the Joys of the City of Habitation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the more he was &s;atisfied that &s;he was a Prin|ce's Daughter travelling to the royal Palace. And when he had lifted up his Eyes to Heaven, and earne&s;tly be&s;ought the mo&s;t High God for Directi|on
<PB N="22" REF="040891_0013_101A0BA7DDA1C8F0">and a Ble&s;&s;ing upon further Conver&s;ation, he came again into her Company. And after &s;ome further Di&s;cour&s;e, he a&s;ked the Rea&s;on of her walk|ing on her Journey alone? She told him &s;he found b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t few travelling the &s;ame Road; and &s;he did not think it expedient to turn a&s;ide or neglect her Way for any Company in the World. If &s;he met with Company, &s;uch as delighted in the Ways of Wi&s;|dom, &s;he took Plea&s;ure therein; for by &s;uch Com|pany her Heart was refre&s;hed, and &s;he thought her&s;elf &s;trengthened in her Journey thereby. But otherwi&s;e &s;he cho&s;e rather to be alone, at Lei&s;ure to divert her&s;elf in examining her Map; viewing the Springs by the Way, with the Fruit Trees and &s;weet Flowers; hearing the Singing of Birds; and meditating on the Glories of her Prince, and the Joys &s;he &s;hould have in his Pre&s;ence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that as Company was plea&s;ant when &s;he could en|joy it, the Delights in the Way &s;upplied the want of Company when alone. And upon the Whole, &s;he neither was anxious to have Company, nor had any Aver&s;ion again&s;t it; her De&s;ire being to enjoy that only which might be mo&s;t conducive to for|ward her in the right Way.</P>
<P>Then he propo&s;ed, that &s;ince they had found each other's Conver&s;ation comfortable and u&s;eful, it was his Opinion, it might be for their mutual Advantage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> together, and engage to keep Company <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Way.

<P>I then ob&s;erved the&s;e two happy Companions, pur&s;uing their Journey: And here I &s;aw verified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n ancient Councel; [a Help-meet.] For they were &s;incere Friends, plea&s;ant Companions, faith|ful Partners, and u&s;eful A&s;&s;i&s;tants to each other. If they met with Difficulties by the Way, they would take each other by the Hand to &s;upport them. In Dangers, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would coun&s;el, and &s;tand by one another. In Sorrows, they would &s;ympa|thize, and comfort one another. If be&s;et with E|nemies, one would watch while the other &s;lept. If one were &s;ick, the other would comfort with cordials. If one were indi&s;po&s;ed in Mind, the other
<PB N="24" REF="040891_0014_101A0BA9C4BA8688">would divert with &s;ome &s;weet &s;ong, or Di&s;cour&s;e concerning the plea&s;ant Land. If one were at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Lo&s;s, concerning any Part of the Way, the other would a&s;&s;i&s;t, in &s;earching and explaining the Di|rections. If one were ready to turn a&s;ide, the other would caution, and admoni&s;h of the Danger. If one were employed in any Service, the other would be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t therein. If one found a refre&s;h|ing Spring by the Way, would call the other to come and drink. If one found any refre&s;hing Fruit, &s;weet Spices, or delightful Flowers would pluck and bring to the other. If one heard any joyful Tidings, would come rejoicing and tell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he other. If one had any plea&s;ant Pro&s;pects of the Kingdom, would endeavour to &s;hew them to the other. If one was favoured with an Audiance of the King, would al&s;o remember and intercede for the other. And if one was ble&s;&s;ed with any &s;pecial Favours, the other would congratulate, and rejoice on the Occa&s;ion. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Then I was convinced, That two are better than one; and yet it was very manife&s;t, that they were no more Twain. For I knew not whether to call them two Souls dwelling in one Body, or one Soul inhabiting two Bodies; but it appear'd very con&s;picuous that two were better than one.</P>
<P>So I continued ob&s;erving this united Pair advan|cing in their Way; for they greatly contributed to help each other forward; many Difficulties they &s;urmounted, and many rich Ble&s;&s;ings they enjoyed as they travelled in the Way.
