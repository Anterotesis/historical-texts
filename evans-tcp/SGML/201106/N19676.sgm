<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN a country where mu&s;ic has not yet become a regular profe&s;&s;ion, it cannot be expected that a compo&s;ition of this kind can &s;tand a rigid critici&s;m; but as every attempt to &s;ub&s;erve the intere&s;t, or to encrea&s;e the innocent plea&s;ures of the community, de&s;erves public patronage, the author of the following work, without further apology, pre&s;ents it to the public eye.</P>
<P>He has aimed at originality in his compo&s;itions, and endeavoured to deviate (as far as he deemed it ju&s;tifiable) from the common &s;tyle; where he has given into it, he has attempted to improve it by a particular attention to the harmony.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have encouraged the work by &s;ub&s;cription, are re&s;pectfully thanked, and are a&s;&s;ured that the ut|mo&s;t pains have been taken to render the work correct; &s;uch errors as e&s;caped ob&s;ervation in the execution of it, are noticed in the errata.</P>
<P>The author &s;incerely wi&s;hes that the purcha&s;ers of the work may derive &s;ufficient advantage from it, to com|pen&s;ate them for their expen&s;es; but &s;hould the rever&s;e be true, he will as &s;incerely lament that he and his friends have mi&s;taken his abilities.</P>

<P>All mu&s;ick is comprehended in <HI>melody</HI> and <HI>harmony.</HI> Melody is a &s;ingle &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of founds; or, in other words, is the air of a piece of mu&s;ic. Harmony is the combination of &s;everal &s;ounds at the &s;ame time. Modula|tion is the ju&s;t arrangement of the &s;ounds both of the Melody and Harmony.</P>
<P>The primary and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential qualities of mu&s;ical &s;ounds are, <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Tune;</HI> upon a due attention to the&s;e di&s;tinctions, and their judicious management, depends all the plea&s;ing and infinite variety of the mu&s;ical art.</P>

<P>There are but &s;even di&s;tinct degrees of &s;ound in the &s;cale; five of which are called whole, and two are called half, or &s;emi-tones. Every eighth from any given &s;ound will be the &s;ame, and the degrees of a&s;cent or de&s;cent from it, will be in effect a repetition of the former &s;ounds. The&s;e &s;even &s;ounds are repre&s;ented on lines and &s;paces by the &s;even fir&s;t letters of the alphabet; their places on them are as follow:

THE &s;cale is divided into three parts; each part, con&s;i&s;ting of five lines, with their &s;paces, and di&s;tingui&s;hed with a cliff, is called a &s;tave.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t divi&s;ion is called the Ba&s;s &s;tave; its cliff is thus marked &fclef; and is called the F cliff&mdash;it is always placed on the fourth line from the bottom.</P>
<P>The &s;econd divi&s;ion of the &s;cale is called the Counter &s;tave;&mdash;its cliff is thus marked &cclef; and is called the C cliff. It is commonly placed on the middle line of the &s;tave. This cliff, however, is moveable, and may be placed on either of the five lines or &s;paces; that line or &s;pace which pa&s;&s;es between the two tran&s;ver&s;e &s;trokes, will be C, and all the other letters of the &s;cale will be in regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion above and below it.</P>
<P>The third and la&s;t divi&s;ion of the &s;cale is called the Treble or Tenor &s;tave; its cliff is marked thus &gclef; and is called the G cliff; its place is invariably on the &s;econd line from the bottom.</P>
<P>There are but four names of notes repre&s;enting &s;ounds, viz. Mi, Fa, Sol, La: of which <HI>Mi</HI> is the principal, and governs all the re&s;t; and when <HI>Mi</HI> is found, the order of the notes above it will be Fa, Sol, La, Fa, Sol, La; and below Mi, La, Sol, Fa, and then <HI>Mi</HI> recurs, either way.</P>
<P>It has been before ob&s;erved, that of the &s;even degrees of &s;ound in the &s;cale, two are &s;emi-tones; their natural places are between B and C, and E and F. Their &s;ituation, however, is often varied by flats and &s;harps, which tran&s;po&s;e Mi from B, its natural place; in all which ca&s;es the &s;emitones will be between Mi and Fa, and La and Fa, as in the natural &s;cale.</P>

<HEAD>Of TIME, and its various MARKS or MODES.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are three kinds of time made u&s;e of in Mu&s;ic, viz. Common Time, Treble Time, and Compound Time.</P>
<P>Common Time is divided into four modes. The fir&s;t mode is called Adagio, and is thus marked <!-- &timeimperf-prolatimperf; --> &commonTime-adagio; This mode contains one &s;emibreve, or the value thereof in other notes or re&s;ts in each bar:&mdash;The bar is u&s;u|ally performed in the time of four &s;econds.</P>
<P>The &s;econd mode of common time is called Largo, and thus marked <!-- &timeimperf-prolatimperf-str; --> &commonTime-largo; It contains the &s;ame quantity of notes in the bar as the foregoing, but is performed a quarter fa&s;ter.</P>
<P>The third mode of common time is called Allegro, and thus marked <!-- &timeimperf-prolatimperf-rev-str; --> &commonTime-allegro; This al&s;o contains the &s;ame notes in a bar as the fir&s;t mode, but the bar is performed in the time of two &s;econds.</P>
<P>The fourth mode of common time is marked 2/4 and contains the amount of one minim in the bar:&mdash;it is per|formed about one quarter fa&s;ter than the Allegro mode.</P>
<P>Treble time is divided into three modes. The fir&s;t mode is marked thus 3/2 and contains three minims in a bar, or other notes and re&s;ts to that amount. The bar is performed in the time of three &s;conds.</P>
<P>The &s;econd mode of treble time is marked thus 3/4 and contains three crotchets or their value in each bar, and is performed about a quarter fa&s;ter.</P>
<P>The third mode of treble time is thus marked 3/8 and contains the value of three quavers in a bar: This mode is performed about a quarter fa&s;ter than the &s;econd.</P>
<P>There are many modes of compound time, two of which only &s;hall be noticed here.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t mode is thus marked 6/4 and contains the value of &s;ix crotchets in a bar. The bar is performed in the time of two &s;econds.</P>
<P>The &s;econd mode is thus marked 6/8 and contains the amount of &s;ix quavers in a bar. It is performed one quar|ter fafter than the fir&s;t mode.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="025695_0011_0FCEC06E52CFF6B8">
It may not be un&s;erviceable to ob&s;erve in this place, that the fir&s;t mode of common time is the &s;tandard with which all other modes are compared, and by which they are regulated. All modes which are marked with figures have a primary reference to this mode, and are derived from it;&mdash;thus, the mark 2/4 denotes that the bar mu&s;t con|tain two fourths of a bar in the fir&s;t mode of common time, or (which is the &s;ame thing) of a &s;emibreve; and all other figures di&s;tingui&s;hing different modes may be con&s;idered as fractions of a &s;emibreve; the under figure ex|pre&s;&s;ing how many parts the &s;emibreve mu&s;t be divided into, and the upper figure &s;hewing how many of tho&s;e parts are contained in a bar.</P>
<P>When the modes above explained are thoroughly under&s;tood, a proper attention to the foregoing remarks will enable any one to acquire an idea of all other modes marked with figures, without any further illu&s;tration.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of BEATING TIME.</HEAD>
<P>BEATING time is an artificial way of mea&s;uting the proportionate duration of the notes; the common methods of doing which, are as follow, yiz. For the two fir&s;t modes of common time, which have four beats in a bar, 1&s;t, let the ends of the fingers fall; 2d, the heel of the hand; 3d, rai&s;e the heel of the hand; 4th, throw up the ends of the fingers, and the bar will be fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>For the third and fourth modes of common time, and for the 6/4 and 6/8 modes of compound time, which have only two beats in a bar, 1&s;t, let the hand fall; 2d, rai&s;e it, and the bar will be completed.</P>
<P>For treble time, all the modes of which have three beats in a bar, 1&s;t, let the ends of the fingers fall; 2d, the heel of the hand; 3d, throw up the ends of the fingers, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Of SYNCOPATION.</HEAD>
<P>NOTES of Syncopation are &s;uch as have their &s;ound continued through bars, or are placed out of their natural order in them; very difficult examples of &s;uch notes may be framed, but when words are applied to them, they in|duce a forced and vicious pronunciation, and never occur in good vocal mu&s;ic; the common in&s;tances are by no means difficult to be executed, and do not merit a particular explanation.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of ACCENT.</HEAD>
<P>ACCENT is a certain modulation or warbling of the &s;ounds, in order to expre&s;s the pa&s;&s;ions naturally with the voice.</P>
<P>Accented parts of the bar are, for common time, the fir&s;t and third parts; for treble time, the fir&s;t part only; for compound time, the fir&s;t and fourth parts of the bar; and emphatical words &s;hould be &s;et to tho&s;e parts; but it will often happen, that &s;uch words will occur in other parts, and the accented parts have words of no empha&s;is; in which ca&s;es, every one mu&s;t feel the propriety of the mu&s;ic's bending to the words, and that the general rule for accenting mu&s;t be neglected; and from hence, may be inferred, that the doctrine of accent is de&s;igned more for the u&s;e of the compo&s;er, than of the performer.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the KEYS of MUSIC.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are but two keys in mu&s;ic, viz. 1&s;t, the major or &s;harp key, and 2d. the minor or flat key. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is adapted to expre&s;s the cheerful pa&s;&s;ions, and the latter is expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;olemn, the mournful and the pathetic.</P>
<P>The key note is that &s;ound upon which a tune may be &s;aid to be built:&mdash;It is the predominant tone, to which all others have a particular reference; it is commonly the concluding note of the tenor, and always that of the ba&s;s,
<PB N="xiii" REF="025695_0013_0FCEC071C0DE4270">In reckoning from the key note, if the &s;emitones in the octave be between the third and the fourth, and between the &s;eventh and the eighth, the tune is in the major or &s;harp key; if they lie between the &s;econd and third, and between the fifth and &s;ixth, it is in the minor or flat key.</P>
<P>In the natural &s;cale the key note of the major key, will be C; of the minor it will be A.</P>
<P><LABEL>EXAMPLES.</LABEL></P>
<P>C, Major Key. <GAP DESC="music">
The regular places for the half tones are between B and C, and E and F, an examination of the octave as laid down above, &s;hews that they lie between the third and fourth, and between the &s;eventh and eighth, con&s;equently it is in the &s;harp key, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A, Minor Key. <GAP DESC="music"> An examination of this octave &s;hews that the &s;emitones are between the &s;econd and third, and between the fifth and &s;ixth, of cour&s;e it is the flat key, &amp;c.</P>
<P>No tune can be regularly compo&s;ed on any other letter be&s;ides C and A, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of flats or &s;harps; but, by a proper placing of them on the lines and &s;paces, every &s;emitone contained in the octave may be made the foundation or key note of a tune: For in &s;tance, if the letter C be taken for the key note of a tune in the major key, one of the &s;emitones will be between the &s;ixth and &s;eventh, whereas it &s;hould be between the &s;eventh and eighth; now, by placing a &s;harp on F, the &s;ound of all the notes on that letter will be a &s;emitone higher than in the natural &s;cale, and con&s;equently leave but half a tone between the &s;eventh and eighth from G; by which mean, G then be|comes regularly the key note for a tune in the &s;harp key.</P>
<P>It would be no difficult ta&s;k to extend this explanation through all the &s;emitones contained in the octave, but perhaps it may be &s;ufficient for learners to be taught to di&s;tingui&s;h the keys, in the fir&s;t place, by the following rule, viz. if the key note be the <HI>Fa</HI> immediately above Mi, a third from it will be a major third, and the mu&s;ic will be in the &s;harp key; but if the key note be the <HI>La</HI> immediately under Mi, a third from it will be a minor third, and the tune will be in the fiat key.</P>
<P>N. B. A. major third contains two whole, or four &s;emitones. A minor third contains but three &s;emitones.</P>

<HEAD>PARTICULAR OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the following work, when tunes have but three parts, the treble is placed between the tenor and the ba&s;s; when they have four parts, the tenor is placed next to the ba&s;s, the counter next to the tenor, and the treble next to the counter.</P>
<P>Flats, &s;harps, and naturals, are not con&s;idered as having influence (excepting at the beginning of tunes or &s;trains) upon any note but that immediately &s;ucceeding.</P>
<P>The pitch of all the parts &s;hould be taken from the key note.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY per&s;on &s;hould &s;ing that part to which his voice is be&s;t adapted; to determine which, learners &s;hould &s;ubmit to the judgment of their teacher.</P>
<P>The tone of the ba&s;s &s;hould be full and maje&s;tic; of the tenor, bold and manly; of the counter, &s;oft yet firm; of the treble, &s;mooth and delicate.</P>
<P>High notes in every part &s;hould, in general, be &s;ung &s;ofter than the low.</P>
<P>In a company of fingers it would have a good effect for &s;ome of the performers on each part to be &s;ilent when pa&s;&s;ages marked <HI>piano,</HI> occur; the additional &s;trength of their voices in the <HI>forte,</HI> which generally precedes or &s;uc|ceeds the <HI>piano,</HI> would mark the contra&s;t more di&s;tinctly, and give peculiar force and energy to the performance.</P>
<P>The various inflections of voice and tone, which render one <HI>air</HI> more expre&s;&s;ive of one pa&s;&s;ion than another, can|not be taught by certain and infallible rules; a performer &s;hould endeavour to form a proper idea of the author's de&s;ign in a piece of mu&s;ic, and his own judgment and ta&s;te mu&s;t be his principal directors in doing ju&s;tice to it.</P>
<P>A good and graceful manner of &s;inging is be&s;t acquired by <HI>imitoetion.</HI> A teacher cannot by precept alone in|&s;truct his pupils in the art of modulating different airs to expre&s;s different pa&s;&s;ions; but by example he can.</P>
<P>Every note of every part of an excellent piece of mu&s;ic may be founded, &s;trictly &s;peaking, right, and the compo|&s;ition, neverthele&s;s, appear dull and trifling. It is the expre&s;&s;ive manner&mdash;the realizing the pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;and giving particular empha&s;is to tho&s;e words which contain the force of the &s;entiment, which give ri&s;e to the inexpre&s;&s;ible de|light derived from hearing good mu&s;ical performances.</P>
<P>The voice, the looks, the ge&s;tures of the performers, are &s;everally nece&s;&s;ary to give mu&s;ic its full energy, and are re&s;pectively the &s;ources of plea&s;ure or di&s;gu&s;t to the ob&s;erving hearer.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="025695_0016_0FCEC07D08973418">
Be&s;ides the artificial graces of mu&s;ic, &s;uch as trills, appoggiatura, &amp;c. there are innumerable others which never have been, nor ever can be, defined; but mu&s;t be learned (as was hinted before) by imitation, or &s;ugge&s;ted by a di&s;|cerning judgment.</P>
<P>Few graces, however, if any, are admi&s;&s;ible in full choru&s;&s;es, unle&s;s they are expre&s;&s;ed in the compo&s;ition; in &s;trains of two or three parts, they may be frequently introduced; but &s;olos are the proper field for their full di&s;play.</P>
<P>A vulgar, inarticulate pronunciation&mdash;a heavy, lifele&s;s manner&mdash;&s;udden and unmeaning explo&s;ions of &s;ound, are totally incon&s;i&s;tent with good &s;inging; on the other hand, a clear and &s;pirited tone&mdash;a ju&s;t and accurate pro|nunciation&mdash;and occa&s;ional &s;wells upon the notes, judiciou&s;ly introduced, are di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tics of an ele|gant performer.</P>
<P>In good mu&s;ic, as well as in good poetry, or in any other &s;pecies of good writing, there are different &s;tyles; &s;ome of which, though they may not, at fir&s;t hearing, command a very favourable opinion, upon being often performed, and rendered familiar, will plea&s;e more, and longer, than others which were thought &s;uperior; hence, the impropriety and inju&s;tice of ha&s;tily rejecting, as worthle&s;s and in&s;ignificant, &s;uch mu&s;ic as may be compo&s;ed out of the common &s;tyle.</P>
<P>In compo&s;ition, it is an e&s;&s;ential point to adapt the tune to the &s;ubject of the &s;ong. Subjects of penitence, pray|er, &s;orrow, &amp;c. require tunes in the minor key; and tho&s;e of cheerfulne&s;s, joy, thank&s;giving; &amp;c. the major key; but this rule is often violated; and with the mo&s;t unhappy and ridiculous effect. Can that joy, or prai&s;e, or thank&s;giving be thought &s;incere, the expre&s;&s;ion of which is accompanied with &s;ighs, and groans, and tears? Can <HI>his</HI> &s;orrow or di&s;tre&s;s appear otherwi&s;e than farcical, who&s;e relation of it is interrupted by &s;allies of plea&s;antry, and peals of laughter? If this be not an unju&s;t repre&s;entation of the effect of di&s;regarding the foregoing rule, (and it is pre&s;umed it is not) it mu&s;t be con&s;idered not only a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion again&s;t all mu&s;ical propriety, but an outrageous affront to common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>In churches and congregations this rule demands a &s;till more particular attention; for an injudicious application of tunes to the p&s;alms or hymns, will make the performance appear a profane burle&s;que upon a very important duty.</P>
<P>A decent and regular demeanor in a band of &s;ingers, adds much to the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from their performances; in wor&s;hipping &s;ocieties, a contrary behaviour is altogether inexcu&s;able, and well de&s;erves the cen&s;ure of every &s;o|ber mind; for it argues a total in&s;en&s;ibility to tho&s;e &s;olemn impre&s;&s;ions, which every one &s;hould feel when in the more immediate pre&s;ence of the <HI>Supreme Being,</HI> and employed in one of the highe&s;t acts of his wor&s;hip.</P>
