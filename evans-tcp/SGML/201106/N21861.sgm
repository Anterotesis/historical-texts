<HEAD>THE <HI>MILLENNIUM.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH there has been no age of the Church in which the Millenium was not admitt|ed by individual divines of the fir&s;t eminence, it is yet evident, from the writings of Eu&s;ebius, Irenaeus, Origen, and others among the ancients, as well as from the hi&s;tories of Dupin, Mo&s;heim, and all the moderns, that it was never adopted by the whole church, or made an article of the e&s;tabli&s;hed creed in any nation.</P>
<P>About the middle of the fourth century the Millinarians held the following tenets:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That the city of Jeru&s;alem &s;hould be re|built, and that the land of Judea &s;hould be the habitation of tho&s;e who are to reign on earth one thou&s;and years.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That the fir&s;t re&s;urrection was not to be confined to the martyrs, but that after the fall of Antichri&s;t all the ju&s;t were to ri&s;e, and all that were on the earth were to continue for that &s;pace of time.</P>
<P N="3">3d. That Chri&s;t &s;hall then come down from Heaven, and be &s;een on earth, and reign there with his &s;ervants.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="4" REF="028789_0003_0FDD458706FCCD98">4th. That the &s;aints, during this period, &s;hall enjoy all the delights of a terre&s;tial paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e opinions were founded upon &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, which the Millenarians, among the fathers, under&s;tood in no other than a literal &s;en&s;e; but which the moderns, who hold that opinion, con&s;ider as partly literal and partly metaphorical. Of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, that upon which the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s has been laid is the following: "And I &s;aw an angel come down from Heaven, having the key of the bottomle&s;s pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old &s;ervant, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him a <HI>thou&s;and years,</HI> and ca&s;t him into the bottomle&s;s pit, and &s;hut him up, and &s;et a &s;eal upon him, that he &s;hould deceive the nations no more till the <HI>thou|&s;and years</HI> &s;hall be fulfilled, and after that he mu&s;t be loo&s;ed a little &s;ea&s;on. And I &s;aw thrones, and they &s;at upon them, and judgment was giv|en unto them, and I &s;aw the &s;ouls of them that were beheaded for the witne&s;s of Je&s;us, and for the word of God, and which had not wor&s;hipp|ed the bea&s;t, neither his image, neither had receiv|ed his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands, and they lived and reigned with Chri&s;t a <HI>thou&s;and years.</HI> But the re&s;t of the dead lived not again till the <HI>thou&s;and years were fini&s;hed.</HI> This is the fir&s;t re&s;urrection. Rom. xx. 1&mdash;6.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age all the ancient Millenarians took
<PB N="5" REF="028789_0004_0FDD458AD5C02550">
in a &s;en&s;e gro&s;sly literal, and taught, that during the Millennium, the &s;aints on earth were to en|joy every bodily delight. The moderns, on the other hand, con&s;ider the power and plea&s;ure of this kingdom as wholly &s;piritual, and they repre|&s;ent them as not to commence till after the con|flagration of the pre&s;ent earth. But that this la&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition is a mi&s;take the very next ver&s;e but one evinces; for it is there &s;aid, that "when the thou&s;and years are expired Satan &s;hall be loo&s;ed out of his pri&s;on, and &s;hall go out to de|ceive the nations which are in the four quarters of <HI>the earth;</HI>" and there is no rea&s;on to believe that he will have &s;uch power or &s;uch liberty in "the new heavens and the <HI>new earth,</HI> wherein dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s."</P>

<HEAD>A CALCULATION ON THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE <HI>MILLENNIUM.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR Brothers has taken much pains to adju&s;t and a&s;certain the Bible chronology. He gives it in detail at the opening of his fir&s;t book and alludes to it in &s;everal parts of the &s;econd, as holding out to men an evident proof that the time for the completion of ancient prophecies, and the recorded period for the execution of God's Judgments is really arrived. But the connection between the age of the world, viz. 5913 years, in A. D. 1794, and this predetermined re&s;olution of the Almighty, is by no means apparent at fir&s;t fight, or to a cur&s;ory ob&s;erver. Something more is certainly nece&s;&s;ary to develope the my&s;|tery, and the following is an attempt to eluci|date it by computation.</P>
<P>Allu&s;ions to the <HI>Millennium</HI> are to be found in all parts of Scripture; and the doctrine ge|nerally received is, that the Mo&s;aic account of the creation of the world is a prophetical type of
<PB N="7" REF="028789_0006_0FDD458E14F8A700">
its duration: taking (according to St. Peter, 2d Eph. chap. iii. ver. 8.) one thou&s;and years <HI>for one day.</HI> So that we are to under&s;tand the world to have been de&s;tined to la&s;t 6000 <HI>years</HI> under the yoke of labour and tribulation, (metaphori|cally &s;ignified by the labours of God in the <HI>&s;ix days of</HI> creation) and one <HI>thou&s;and</HI> years under that di&s;pen&s;ation which is typified by God's re&s;t|ing on the Sabbath-day, and which is called Chri&s;t's Kingdom, or the Kingdom of Heaven, or the dominion of the Saints, &amp;c. &amp;c. when it is expre&s;sly &s;aid, that the Saints &s;hould enter into the <HI>re&s;t of God,</HI> and <HI>e conver&s;o</HI> of the wicked, it is &s;aid, "unto whom I &s;ware in my wrath that <HI>they &s;hould not enter into my re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if we &s;uppo&s;e the 5913 years, above|mentioned by Mr. Brothers, to be common years of &s;olar time, we find 87 years &s;till wanting to arrive at the clo&s;e of the &s;ix &s;ymbolical days of la|bour, and con&s;equently we are too remote from the period of the Millennium to have any thing either to hope or fear per&s;onally from its ap|proach. But if we advert to that mode of calcu|lation univer&s;ally adopted, both by Daniel and St. John in their prophecies; where not only a day is taken for a year, but a month invariably made to contain 30 &s;uch days, and 42 months to comprehend 1260 &s;uch days, and the&s;e 1260 days to form exactly three years and a half, and therefore every &s;uch year to con&s;i&s;t of 360 &s;uch
<PB N="8" REF="028789_0007_0FDD458F4E74F550">
days. We may very well adopt this method of computation in our endeavours to explain any prophetical chronology, and may very fairly call tho&s;e <HI>Divine years,</HI> by which, as Mr. Brothers expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>"God fulfils his recorded judgments."</HI> Now admitting the common &s;olar year to con&s;i&s;t of 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 54&frac34; &s;econds, and multiplying 5913 years into quarters of &s;e|conds, we &s;hall find, on dividing this quotient by 360, a produce amounting to 5999 &s;uch di|vine years and a fraction; which fraction, de|ducted from the &s;um total of one year, leaves a deficiency, at the end of the year of our Lord 1794, equal to 322 days 6 hours 40 minutes 23&frac14; &s;econds, being &s;o much wanting, at the opening of the pre&s;ent year, to the full completion of 6000 <HI>divine</HI> or <HI>prophetical</HI> years: and &s;hewing that the Millenium will commence, on the 19th of November next, at or about &s;un-ri&s;e, in the latitude of Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>If this calculation be true, it follows that the time during which "the Saints &s;hall live and reign with Chri&s;t," which according to St. John, in Rev. chap. xx. ver. 4, is <HI>one thou&s;and years,</HI> mu&s;t be in fact 360,000 years. So that the Millennium will bear the &s;ame analogical pro|portion to the previous duration of the world as that very previous duration it&s;elf holds to the &s;ix original days of the creation.</P>

<HEAD>CURSORY REMARKS ON THE PAMPHLET INTITULED, <HI>"THE AGE OF CREDULITY."</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE anonymous Author of a pamphlet, intitled, <HI>"The Age of Credulity,"</HI> was &s;o oblig|ing as to &s;end the book ye&s;terday to me; with an opinion, I pre&s;ume, that I &s;hould find its ar|guments incontrovertible, and the po&s;itions I have a&s;&s;umed in my own publication totally untenable. I &s;hould be &s;orry to interrupt the gentleman's tri|umph by any un&s;ea&s;onable &s;everity, and I am ut|terly aver&s;e to all argument for argument's &s;ake.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, therefore, only beg him to take in good part the few hints which I here ha&s;tily throw out for his con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>If he had turned to Cruden's Concordance, article "Wing," he would have found (4th &s;ig|nification "it is put for the &s;ails of a &s;hip," I&s;aiah xviii. 1. <HI>"Woe to the land &s;hadowing with wings;"</HI> meaning Egypt, which abounded with &s;hips, "who&s;e <HI>&s;ails</HI> were like <HI>wings</HI> that &s;hadow the &s;ea."</P>
<P>So much for his pithy objection in the 15th page. The grand <HI>cheval de battaille</HI> of all my doughty opponents has been Daniel's vi&s;ion, as explained by certain former clear-&s;ighted expo&s;i|tors,
<PB N="13" REF="028789_0012_0FDD459E204FE190">
to mean four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive monarchies; viz. Babylonian, Mede-Per&s;ian, Grecian, and Ro|man.&mdash;I have been &s;o bartered and annoyed with this ridiculous phantom, that I &s;hall here demo|li&s;h it altogether, at once, for the peace of the public, as well as my own.</P>
<P>Daniel &s;aw this vi&s;ion after Nebuchadnezzer <HI>was dead,</HI> as is evident from the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the &s;eventh chapter. After this, what does my ano|nymous author think of the &s;uppo&s;ition mentioned in his 14th page? The four bea&s;ts meant mo|narchs, and not <HI>monarchies.</HI> See the 12th ver&s;e. "As concerning the re&s;t of the bea&s;ts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a &s;ea&s;on and time." The <HI>life of a do|minion</HI> I can conceive to be a poetical phra&s;e, and admit its propriety; but to take away the domi|nion from a dominion, and yet prolong the life of that dominion, is too much even for me, with all my credulity, to comprehend.</P>
<P>Daniel &s;aw this vi&s;ion in the fir&s;t year of the reign of Bel&s;hazzar, the very la&s;t king of Babylon, who lo&s;t his life at the &s;ame moment with his do|minion, and therefore his life certainly was not prolonged for a <HI>&s;ea&s;on</HI> nor a <HI>time.</HI> And in the 17th ver&s;e of this &s;ame &s;eventh chapter, the angel tells Daniel, "The&s;e great bea&s;ts, which are four, are four kings, which &s;hall ari&s;e out of the earth,"&mdash;<HI>&s;hall</HI> ari&s;e&mdash;in the future ten&s;e; not, one of whom is already ri&s;en,&mdash;and <HI>kings,</HI> not
<PB N="14" REF="028789_0013_0FDD459F1C22A300">
<HI>kingdoms.</HI> From this ver&s;e nothing can be more undubitable, than that the king or kingdom of Babylon is totally out of the que&s;tion; and there|fore the other three monarchies, in the common interpretation, all nece&s;&s;arily fall to the ground as ve&s;ting on this ba&s;e. I hope I &s;hall never here them mentioned again. My author hampers him&s;elf again in his 21&s;t page, on the &s;imilitude and di&s;&s;imilitude between the fourth bea&s;t of Da|niel and the eagle of E&s;dras. If he will cavil at nothing, or every thing, let him. But if he choo&s;e to read and think ingenuou&s;ly for him&s;elf, he might find, that Daniel omits in his fourth bea&s;t, as in the other three, to make any mention of the ri&s;e or &s;plendour, or even exi&s;tence of <HI>monar|chies:</HI> His bea&s;ts are mere per&s;onages, and his fourth the Emperor of Germany; &s;ub&s;titute for, and &s;tanding avowedly and o&s;tentatiou&s;ly in the place of the ancient emperors of Rome. E&s;dras delineates the monarchy or kingdom it&s;elf, of which he expre&s;sly &s;ays, in the 12th chapter and 12th ver&s;e of the &s;econd book, that the Lord told him this kingdom <HI>"was not expounded unto his bro|ther Daniel,"</HI> and therefore it was now explain|ed to him. E&s;dras &s;aw the whole hi&s;tory in de|tail, and even what would come to pa&s;s after the death of the pre&s;ent Emperor of Germany, the pre&s;ent Pope, and pre&s;ent King of Pru&s;&s;ia, the three heads of his eagle: whereas Daniel only beheld the pre&s;ent Emperor and electors of the
<PB REF="028789_0014_0FDD45A0936170E8">
Germanic body, without a glimp&s;e of the Anti-chri&s;t or of the pope.</P>
<P>By the <HI>&s;ale of &s;ouls,</HI> pages 24 and 25, (for I am not writing a regular an&s;wer to a pamphlet) which is too in&s;ignificant to de&s;erve one; but ha&s;tily running over a few of its capital errors, is meant <HI>a con&s;cious &s;ale of an article known to be in one's own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI> Tho&s;e who purcha&s;e pardons and indulgences of popes, are not in this predi|cament.</P>
<P>Of Mr. Brothers's <HI>pre&s;umption, ignorance and artifice,</HI> of which he is accu&s;ed in the 27th, and &s;ub&s;equent pages, I &s;hall take no notice: my au|thor may compare his own pamphlet with the few remarks I have here thrown together, <HI>and &s;et in judgment on him&s;elf,</HI> on the &s;ame articles.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall boldly and authoritatively, retort the charges of <HI>fal&s;ehood,</HI> in every one of the par|ticulars by him enumerated, pages 33 and 34.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, "the defeat of the Emperor's ar|my in the Netherlands." It is <HI>&s;candalous</HI> to term a prediction <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e it is <HI>not yet fulfilled. I &s;ay al&s;o,</HI> the Emperor's army <HI>will be</HI> defeated in the Netherlands: and if there were no other pre|di&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e for this defeat, an attempt to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Luxembourg, now &s;eriou&s;ly in|ve&s;ted, would &s;uffice for the purpo&s;e: and I add, therefore, that he <HI>will</HI> acknowledge the French republic, and <HI>will</HI> make peace with it.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Dutch <HI>have acknowledged the</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="028789_0015_0FDD45A3F2982218">
French Republic, and <HI>are</HI> making a ha&s;ty peace with it. Mr. Brothers never &s;aid it would hap|pen without a conque&s;t, or that they would treat on equal terms. For the completion of his pro|phecy, it is enough that they &s;hould have acted as <HI>they are acting.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Brothers <HI>never &s;aid,</HI> our army would be di&s;banded and &s;ent home, <HI>by the twenty-fifth of March:</HI> our author, therefore, &s;hould not have incurred the ri&s;k of the retort di&s;courteous, un|til our army was out of the po&s;&s;ibility of being &s;o treated at all. Nor did he ever a&s;&s;ert that <HI>the Duke of York</HI> would be detained: he expre&s;sly &s;ays, "the <HI>general</HI>" of the Engli&s;h forces. That is now Count Walmoden: to-morrow it may be &s;omebody el&s;e; but to do away all chance of verification, the ar-&s;hould be proved to have no general at all.</P>
<P>In the&s;e three little articles, wherein our ano|nymous author has attempted to fix an imputation of fal&s;ehood on Mr. Brothers, he has convicted him&s;elf of <HI>"pre&s;umption,&mdash;ignorance&mdash;artifice&mdash; and fal&s;ehood;</HI> and here I leave him.</P>

<P>TO avoid the imputation of appearing trouble&s;ome, I waited a con&s;iderable time after the half-pay was adverti&s;ed, that a very ju&s;t applica|tion, tho' I believe unprecedented, &s;hould not di&s;|plea&s;e the Admiralty. Government is in my debt to a much greater amount than twelve months; and altho' I have not enjoyed any emo|lument, perqui&s;ite, or profit, from any bu&s;ine&s;s or employment whatever, the only rea&s;on advanced for detaining my property, is the want of being qualified every &s;ix months, by &s;wearing the con|tents of a certificate as the re&s;ult of my own plea|&s;ure and inclination, when an order of council commands me, and ab&s;olutely prohibits the pay|ment until I do.</P>

To &s;wear, then, agreeably to the pre&s;cribed form laid down by the privy council, is obvious to the plaine&s;t capacity a &s;urreptitious oath, con|cealing its deformity under that mild appellation: for I hope no man is &s;o far lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of vir|tue, as to prefer taking an idle oath of this kind, or any other de&s;cription, when permitted an op|tion, by the very word voluntarily, to decline it.</P>
<P>In&s;tructed from my infancy to guard again&s;t fal&s;ehood, as the mo&s;t poi&s;onous evil that can po&s;|&s;ibly invade the human mind, and to court truth as the mo&s;t beautiful of all moral virtues, I view an oath as the mo&s;t awful and &s;olemn appeal which a man can po&s;&s;ibly make: the pre&s;ent judges &s;ay it &s;hould be admini&s;tered with caution, and never repeated except when pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity requires! for this rea&s;on, an oath before them is a public bond of true evidence; tear away the &s;olemnity by habitual practice, the &s;acred barrier falls to the

ground, and every man enters wild and lawle&s;s on the common of perjury.</P>
<P>It was the language of Mr. Pitt, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, (I a&s;k pardon for the introduction of his name) when a clau&s;e was offered for a cer|tain bill late in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, recommending an annual oath, or thereabouts, as nece&s;&s;ary for the better payment of that part of the revenue it went to de&s;cribe, his an&s;wer was, &s;uch a multiplication of oaths tended to de&s;troy every public principle, promote fraud and perjury, more than any imme|diate benefit to the Exchequer could po&s;&s;ibly com|pen&s;ate to &s;ociety. I lament, &s;entiments equally di&s;cerning and honourable do not adorn the heart of every man.</P>
<P>Having &s;erved under three commanders, not le&s;s amiable in private life than eminently con&s;pi|cuous on the li&s;t of profe&s;&s;ional merit, their pa|rental precepts, their example of rectitude and manners, remain &s;till as an admoni&s;hing le&s;&s;on of advice never to be departed from. To drink from a foul &s;tream, in preference to a clear foun|tain, for no other rea&s;on than a multitude being con&s;tantly led by official per&s;ua&s;ion to do &s;o, without once deigning to examine the contaminat|ed re&s;ource it flowed from, or, as a gentleman in the commi&s;&s;ion of the peace ob&s;erved to me with evident marks of di&s;plea&s;ure, what bu&s;ine&s;s have you to object again&s;t it, when others do it? would be treating every faculty with ingratitude, and

manife&s;t an open indifference for the good of knowledge.</P>
<P>I can pa&s;s by the oath; it is frequently done; the terms are low, &s;afe, and practical ea&s;y; for it is incon&s;i&s;tent with common &s;en&s;e to take a voluntary oath as an act of nece&s;&s;ity; it is a bad doctrine that goes to obliterate the terror of iniquity by habitual repetition, and actually libels the propriety of ju&s;tice; but to be forced in any manner, and &s;wear to the contrary! or if the fraud was di&s;covered, I believe it would torture the invention of the mo&s;t learned di&s;qui&s;itor to frame a pro&s;ecution for counterfeiting a forced, unju&s;t, nominal, voluntary oath. To me, the eva&s;ion would be di&s;honourable, and amount to a crime of equal magnitude as embracing the evil I complain of.</P>
<P>Profane &s;wearing, or any other de&s;cription of idle oaths, as a pa&s;&s;port to receive tho&s;e wages the law, rea&s;on, and equity, does not allow the detention of, under any pretence, in the mo&s;t uncivilized countries, is forcing a man privately by the mo&s;t cruel of all tortures, to the commi&s;|&s;ion of iniquity, without being able to advance even a plau&s;ible rea&s;on in its defence; for I ob|&s;erve, it is not for the prevention of fraud to the revenue, or to prevent that kind of emolument in future, which it goes back to di&s;cover, neither is it to prohibit an officer from wandering abroad, when liable to be called for at home, but for a

purpo&s;e which may be gue&s;&s;ed at&mdash;delicacy will not allow me to mention.</P>
<P>At any rate, as men of more liberal and inde|pendent characters now fill the departments of State, than at the period which gave birth to this curious order, the intention it was intro|duced for is now done away, con&s;equently a continuance of it is entirely unnece&s;&s;ary: not|with&s;tanding the remote period of its formation, tho&s;e who advi&s;ed it, were in &s;ome degree &s;en|&s;ible that a public oath could not be impo&s;ed on any part of the community beyond the walls of the council chamber, unle&s;s &s;pecifically intro|duced and authori&s;ed by act of Parliament, or &s;o great a people would never attempt to conceal the imbecility of a mea&s;ure, and fritter away their own power, by retiring behind the &s;peci|ous form of 'this deponent voluntarily makes oath,' when an ab&s;olute order was in force to carry it into execution, or &s;top the payment of wages until it was obeyed.</P>
<P>If I am to be precluded from all u&s;e of my property, becau&s;e I do not implicitly &s;wear to error and contradiction, under the vain idea of compul&s;ion being an ample &s;hield again&s;t the di&s;|grace of &s;wearing improperly, and that the enor|mity would revert on tho&s;e who impo&s;ed it, &s;uch language is beneath any man that had under|&s;tanding to perceive, though not fortitude to op|po&s;e; clothed with the benign hand of provi|dence

<P>THE Prophe&s;ies and revealed knowledge communicated to the world by Richard Brothers, having generally attracted public notice, I think it my duty to &s;tate &s;ome of them as they have been al|ready fulfilled, and let the world judge of them according to their own knowledge and belief. The truth of them ought to be carefully examin|ed. That &s;uch a man will come there can be no doubt of, and is expre&s;sly mentioned, Jerem. xxviii. 9. "The Prophet which prophe&s;ieth of PEACE; when the word of the prophet &s;hall come to pa&s;s, then &s;hall the prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly &s;ent him."</P>

The&s;e things having been already fulfilled, ought to be a caution to every body how they deny Revelation and Prophecy, and it behoves every per&s;on to examine into the revealed prophe|cies very carefully, and judge impartially.

<P>Richard Brothers &s;tands in the Court Calen|der as a naval officer, Jan. 3, 1783. Surely then his character and behaviour during his continu|ance in the navy are very ea&s;ily to be enquired by tho&s;e that doubt his &s;anity. Becau&s;e he quotes Scripture and believes in GOD, is too ridiculous, one would think, for any per&s;on to &s;et him down either as an impo&s;tor or a madman. If he has not wrote tho&s;e letters to government, as he a&s;|&s;erts, then he is a fal&s;e prophet, and the <HI>onus probandi</HI> lays with the mini&s;ters, &amp;c.
