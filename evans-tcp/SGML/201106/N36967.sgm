<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>DEAR Son, you re|member that &s;ome con&s;iderable time ago, we took a rambling walk through the or|chards, fields and meadows, and clo&s;e by the &s;ide of the river, where we took a view of the bridges, mills and falls, and proceeded down the &s;tream until it emptied it&s;elf in|to the ocean, where the great &s;hips traver&s;e the main, and go round the world, which is above twenty thou&s;and miles, or as the &s;hips mu&s;t &s;ail, to go round the
<PB N="6" REF="048411_0004_1025347C888BF148">different capes of land, it will be above forty thou&s;and miles, before they can get back to the place from whence they &s;at out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I very well remember that agreeable walk, and &s;hould be glad to take another &s;uch, if you would go with me.&mdash;But I never could under&s;tand how the &s;hips could go round the world, when there is &s;o much land as well as wa|ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear &s;on, it is not &s;trange that you &s;hould not fully under&s;tand it, for there are many men that cannot fully comprehend it. But when you are older and have read &s;ome books on geogra|phy, and had an opportunity al&s;o to &s;ee a terre&s;tial globe, where the globe is divided into land and wat|er, and where the tract of Lord
<PB N="7" REF="048411_0005_102534818D0D8D80">Ar&s;on and Capt. Cook, is marked out on the globe, you may ea&s;ily conceive how they may go round the world, and return again to the place from which they &s;at out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly &s;ir, I think it would be a very plea&s;ing &s;tudy, and I hope that I &s;hall &s;oon be ready to begin it, for I &s;hould be greatly plea&s;ed to &s;ee how the globe is di|vided into land and water, and to &s;ee where the different nations of the world live, and whether they be black or white, heathen or chri&s;tian, and what is the produce and manufacture of the different parts of the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis truly a very agree|ble &s;tudy, and at a proper time I &s;hall be glad to in&s;truct you therein, but at pre&s;ent we will de|fer it, and talk of &s;omething el&s;e.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you remem|ber to have read in the Bible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember that in the beginning God created the world, the heavens and the earth, the &s;un, moon and &s;tars, and the &s;ea, and all in the &s;pace of &s;ix days, and re&s;|ted from his labour on the &s;eventh, which was the &s;abbath.</P>

<P>We read that he was pla|ced in the garden of Eden, which is al&s;o called the garden of Para|di&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Was he to live there alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, we read that God &s;aid it was not good that man &s;hould be alone, and he cau&s;ed a deep &s;leep to fall on Adam, and he took out one of his ribs, of which he made a woman, and brought her to Adam to &s;ee what he would call her, and he called her Eve, for &s;he was bone of his bone, and fle&s;h of his fle&s;h, and &s;he became his wife.</P>

<SP>

<P>Did God after this &s;uf|fer them to continue in the garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, we read that God turned them out of the garden, and placed a flaming &s;word to prevent their return, and God cur&s;ed the earth in con&s;equence of their &s;in|ing, and &s;aid, that it &s;hould bring forth briars and thorns, and that men &s;hould earn their bread with the &s;weat of their brows, until they &s;hould again return to the earth.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was not God angry with Cain for killing his brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is &s;aid, that God was very angry with him, and told him that he &s;hould be a vagabond up|on the earth, and that every one who &s;ound him &s;hould &s;lay him; and Cain &s;aid, that his puni&s;h|ment was greater than he could bear, and God &s;et a mark upon him, lea&s;t any finding him &s;hould &s;lay him.</P>

<P>And how did Noah know when the waters were abated on the earth.</P>

<P>We read that the waters prevailed on the earth 150 days, but after 40 days Noah opened a window and let out a dove, who after flying about and finding no place to re&s;t her feet upon, &s;he re|turned
<PB N="17" REF="048411_0015_102534F15426B8D0">to Noah and he took her again into the Art; and then he waited &s;even days more, and let her go out again, and after a while &s;he returned with an olive leaf in her mouth plucked off, by which Noah &s;uppo&s;ed the waters were a|bated, and after &s;even days more be let out the dove again and &s;he never returned, and after a while the Ark re&s;ted on a great mountain called Ararat.</P>

<P>How long was this flood upon the face of the earth.</P>
</SP>

<P>We read that in the &s;ixth hundred and fir&s;t year of Noah, the fir&s;t month and fir&s;t day of the month, the waters were dried from off the face of the earth, and No|ah and his family, and all the crea|tures in the Ark went out upon the dry land.</P>

<P>We read that God made a covenant with him, and it was confirmed by a rainbow, that the earth &s;hould not again be drowned.</P>

<P>After the flood, was the po&s;terity of Noah all good, or did the people again be wicked.</P>

<SP>

<P>We read that they again become very wicked, and thought in their pride to build a great tow|er, that &s;hould reach up to heaven, and God was angry, and came down and de&s;troyed their language, &s;o that they could not under&s;tand each other, and &s;o they were &s;cat|tered upon the face of the earth.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the meaning of that text is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be, that a Saviour, the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> &s;hould come into this world, and make &s;atisfaction for the &s;ins of man, and &s;o de&s;troy the works of Satan, and thereby prepare the way for man to be finally &s;aved.</P>

<P>Was there any further prophecy of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> who was to come into the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there were many prophecies and intimations thereof, to Noah, Abraham, I&s;aac, and Ja|cob, to David, I&s;aiah, and other Prophets of old, and all the &s;acri|fices of bea&s;ts and birds, &amp;c. that we read of in the old te&s;tament, are &s;uppo&s;ed to look forward to that

</SP>
<SP>

<P>And did the Me&s;&s;iah tru|ly come into the world, agreeable to the prophecy and expectation of the people, who were looking and waiting for the accompli&s;hment of the&s;e prophecies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, in the fulne&s;s of time, namely, at about the four thou&s;andth year of the world, the Me&s;&s;iah made his appearance to the Jews and the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did not the Jews, (God's ancient people,) expect him as a temporal king, and that he
<PB N="21" REF="048411_0019_102534B102666528">would be u&s;hered into the world in great pomp and &s;plendor, and that he would deliver them from their bondage to the Romans.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly this was their expectations, and they were greatly di&s;appointed when they found that he rather took on him the form of a &s;ervant, and was poor and de&s;pi&s;ed in the world.</P>

<P>Truly, I believe that tho&s;e who repent and believe on Chri&s;t, will not fail of being &s;aved and going to Heaven; but they who have true faith and repentance will be di&s;po&s;ed to good works, and to hate every wicked and fal&s;e way, to do as they would be done by, and attend unto all the rules

<P>Truly I am obliged to you, for the good in&s;truction given me, and I can &s;ay as King Agrippa &s;aid to Paul, thou almo&s;t per&s;uad|e&s;t me to be a Chri&s;tian.</P>

<P>THE mo&s;t ingenious and u&s;e|ful arts are of cele&s;tial origin; and from this chapter it is evident, that the fir&s;t &s;hip that ever floated on the world of waters, was built ac|cording to the plan, and under the regulating eye, of a divine artificer. With what amazing contrivance and oeconomy were the directions given by the Deity to Noah? How exact the architecture, and what judicious hints were hence furni|&s;hed to human creatures in regard
