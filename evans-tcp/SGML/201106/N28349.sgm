<SALUTE>MY DEAR UNCLE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I write you the&s;e lines, at this time, which is likely (by an accident which has befallen me) to be the la&s;t day of my life.</P>
<P>Wi&s;hing to &s;upport that unfortunate Republic, and &s;eeking to return to my own country, I was induced to commit an action, contrary to the laws of God, and of civilized nations&mdash;which hath &s;hortened my days.</P>
<P>I pray you, my dear uncle, not to forget to make known my unfortunate lot, to my relations and guardians, that they may take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my property.

<P>The&s;e three unfortunate young men were attended, from the time they received their &s;entence, to the day of their execution, by clergymen of different per&s;ua&s;ions, and they employed them&s;elves almo&s;t unremittedly in acts of devotion; and appeared truly penitent, and anxious to obtain favour from an offended God, through the merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="037781_0005_100F4C95EC566720">
<HI>Peter La Croix, &s;hortly before his execution, gave the following account of his life.</HI></P>
<Q><P>"I was born in Flanders; my parents gave me a good edu|cation; and my mother, particularly, never failed to give the be&s;t admonitions; but, unfortunately, I did not comply with them; on the contrary, I followed my own wicked inclinations. I was only a boy when I went to &s;ea, and I engaged at la&s;t in the Low-Dutch, or Holland &s;ervice; but, not liking this, I went over to England. I &s;oon returned from thence to Hol|land; and; in order not to be brought to puni&s;hment as a de|&s;erter, I changed my name, and called my&s;elf <HI>Peter Peterson.</HI> My re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit &s;oon drove me away from Holland again; and I wandered from one place to another.</P>
<P>"During the whole time, after I had left my parents, I led a very ungodly life. I had not, nor did I care, for any good book; and, particularly, I never read in that book, which is now my only con&s;olation,&mdash;<HI>the Bible.</HI></P>
<P>"God and Eternity were only my &s;port. I was a true bla&s;|phemer; and I now recollect, with horror, that I actually lifted up my fi&s;t again&s;t the Almighty; and, in the tumult of my pa&s;&s;ion challenged his vengeance.</P>
<P>"I could &s;ay a great deal about the dreadful murder on board of the Eliza, but I think it unnece&s;&s;ary: This one circum|&s;tance I cannot, however, conceal, that <HI>I never actually kil|led one myself of those who were murdered:</HI> But this does not excu&s;e me, becau&s;e I could have &s;aved their lives: Yet, though it was in my power, as I did not prevent the murder, but, on the contrary, &s;ided with tho&s;e who perpetrated it, I have certainly de&s;erved death, and &s;hortly &s;hall ju&s;tly &s;uffer what my actions merit."</P></Q>
<P>To the above, we have to add, that the name of La Croix was no more his real name than that of Peter&s;on; and he certainly had his rea&s;ons why he changed his name the &s;e|cond time&mdash;rea&s;ons which were obviou&s;ly not founded on his good behaviour.</P>
<P>He di&s;clo&s;ed his real name to one of the mini&s;ters, who vi&s;ited him: but begged that it might be kept a &s;ecret, as he did not wi&s;h to expo&s;e his relations to that di&s;grace which the publicity of his unhappy end undoubtedly would.</P>
<P>According to his account, he is of a re&s;pectable family; and his mother, brethren, and &s;i&s;ters were yet alive, as far as he knew.</P>
<P>The author of this &s;hort account did not &s;ee the pri&s;oner until &s;entence had been pa&s;&s;ed on him; and, therefore, can
<PB N="5" REF="037781_0006_100F4C984F9E0048">only relate what &s;ituation he found him in, during that &s;hort &s;pace of time.</P>
<P>The unhappy man was, in tho&s;e days, as much as appeared, quiet, and perfectly re&s;igned. His chief occupation was the &s;tudy of the Scriptures; and, in the&s;e, the Old. Te&s;tament as well as the New, he was &s;urpri&s;ingly ver&s;ed. He made many &s;en&s;ible and &s;triking remarks upon &s;ome texts, which might otherwi&s;e be accounted difficult; and it appeared, plainly, that he under&s;tood what he read. It was a great advantage to him, that, in his early days, he had been well acquainted with the Bible; for, although he afterwards reviled the &s;ame, and even &s;coffed at it, yet, at the hour of death, it was his only refuge; and this, without a doubt, becau&s;e the ble&s;&s;ed recollection of what it had been to him in his youth, encouraged him there|to. He confe&s;&s;ed that he never had cared for the Scriptures &s;ince his infancy, until he was confined in the cell of the Philadelphia Pri&s;on. In this di&s;tre&s;s, he knew of no other remedy to allay his apprehen&s;ions. He read, and the more he read, the more he wi&s;hed to read; and he mu&s;t really have been very indu&s;trious, in this his employment, or el&s;e it would have been impo&s;&s;ible, that, in &s;o &s;hort a time, he &s;hould have become &s;o well acquainted with this book, as he really was.</P>
<P>When vi&s;ited, he complained of nothing more than of the hardne&s;s of his heart. This he looked upon as the &s;evere&s;t judgment of God, which the Lord had inflicted upon him for his enormous iniquities. He acknowledged how great the difference was between the faith of the head and of the heart: He complained that the latter remained &s;o &s;trange to him. He prayed frequently; yet, according to his own declaration, altho' the words proceeded from his mouth, his heart and &s;entiments had no &s;hare therein. He believed in Je&s;us as his Saviour; but this belief made no impre&s;&s;ion upon his heart. He &s;hewed great concern, le&s;t the Lord &s;hould re|ject him, and that he would hardly accept of a &s;inner like him. His approaching end, did not, according to his ac|knowledgment, occa&s;ion in him any fear. He confe&s;&s;ed that he had perfectly de&s;erved this puni&s;hment; but, that the judgment of God, and of eternity, were dreadful to him: That the recollection of his &s;ins, and the damnation which he had de&s;erved, were the gnawing worm of his heart.</P>
<P>In this &s;orry and dreadful &s;ituation of mind, he was found con&s;tantly, until about three days before his execution: when beamed a &s;mall glimp&s;e of grace upon his darkened &s;oul. A very applicable German Hymn was read to him, which drew the fir&s;t tears from his eyes, and his heart was con&s;ide|rably releaved by it. From that moment, he began to be
<PB N="6" REF="037781_0007_100F4C9A2F1F4B20">more ea&s;y. He now peru&s;ed the Scriptures with more &s;en|&s;ation: Reading Luke 11, 1, 12, he exclaimed: <HI>"Now this must be true, what Jesus has said, for be never spoke an un|truth; and so the Almighty God will, for all, hear my prayers."</HI> And here-his-eyes were bathed in tears.</P>
<P>The above-mentioned Hymn gave great con&s;olation to him; he read it him&s;elf, and he cau&s;ed it to be read to him repeatedly.</P>
<P>On the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> morning of his life, when he was vi&s;ited, and a&s;ked how it was now with him? his an&s;wer was, <HI>"Oh, it is better,&mdash;much better with me. I had a very good night; I have prayed the whole night. The Lord Jesus ordered me to watch and pray! No sleep came into my Eyes, and I feel now much easier."</HI></P>
<P>Particularly important it was to him, that which he had read that morning in Harvey's Meditations on the Night, where he introduces a Latin Motto on a Sun-dial. The tran&s;lation of which is, <HI>"On this moment depends an eternity." Each moment;</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>is now, for certain, to me, an eternity; and, for that reason, I like to do nothing better than praying:</HI></P>
<P>During this conver&s;ation, a woman came in, who &s;aid that &s;he was his mother. He looked at her without the lea&s;t emotion; and only &s;aid, <HI>"no,&mdash;no,&mdash;that is not my mother. I know that my mother could not be in Philadelphia."</HI> It is &s;aid that the woman, her&s;elf, afterwards, acknowledged her error.</P>
<P>As one of tho&s;e, who vi&s;ited him took his leave, (bur&s;ting into tears) he &s;aid, <HI>"Ah! I hope and I believe we shall see one another again in bliss with the Lord. Farewell&mdash;farewell, and thanks for your kindness."</HI></P>
<P>He had given to the &s;ame per&s;on, the evening before, a Letter, with a reque&s;t to forward the &s;ame to his brother, and to de&s;ire him to inform his mother of his fate; at lea&s;t, of his death. Here follows the tran&s;lation of the letter, which was written in the Low-Dutch language.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR BROTHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS is the la&s;t letter which you will receive from me; and I hope that the great and Almighty God, will let you come to a better end than that which I am come to: Becau&s;e I for&s;ook the Al|mighty

Dear brother, I write this in chains and fetters, about twenty hours before my death, in hopes that you will take the &s;ame to heart, and tru&s;t in him, whom I had for&s;aken,&mdash;but on whom I now place my only hopes, and confide in his unmerited mercy.

</LETTER>
<P>Reader! The crimes of the&s;e young men were the great|e&s;t that can be committed in civil &s;ociety&mdash;and highly aggra|vated by many attrocious circum&s;tances. Although they have not furni&s;hed the world with a particular account of their pa&s;t lives, it is almo&s;t certain, that, though young men, they had pur&s;ued a di&s;&s;olute and abandoned cour&s;e,&mdash;regardle&s;s of God, before whom they are now to be judged&mdash;and who, in his all-wi&s;e Providence, &s;topped them in their vicious career.</P>
<P>Murder is a crime of &s;o deep a dye, that it &s;eldom or ne|ver e&s;capes a temporal puni&s;hment;&mdash;though God, in his in|finite mercy, may grant repentance, and, thereby, the unhappy perpetrator may not be finally &s;hut out from eternal hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="037781_0009_100F4C9EEBD61F48">
How much rea&s;on had the&s;e per&s;ons to rejoice, that they were brought to a city, where the con&s;olation of the go&s;pel were held out to them, by pious divines;&mdash;that they were not &s;natched into eternity, from their wicked cour&s;es, in a moment, without time or opportunity to reflect on, and re|pent, of their mi&s;pent life, and the di&s;regard they had paid to the commandments of God, or the laws of man.</P>
<P>It is &s;incerely hoped, that their untimely fate may be a warning to all young men, to for&s;ake the paths of vice, and to remember their Creator in the days of their youth&mdash;to gain a living by hone&s;t indu&s;try, rather than by violence upon the per&s;ons or property of others, in whatever &s;tations they are alloted to,&mdash;whether by Land or Sea.</P>
<P>They were taken from the cells about 11 o'clock, dre&s;&s;ed, in white, in one cart, accompanied by two clergymen, to Market-&s;treet wharf, where they were put on beard a boat, and conveyed to the place of execution, on the I&s;land, op|po&s;ite Dock-&s;treet, and guarded by the mar&s;hall, &s;heriff and other peace-officers. They continued in prayer until near twelve o'clock; when the executioner performed his la&s;t office to them, and they were launched into eternity, in the view of an immen&s;e concour&s;e of &s;pectators, who crouded the wharfs and the &s;hipping. They made no other &s;peech, than begging the world to forgive them, as they forgave every per&s;on in it.</P>
<P>Captain Wheland was pre&s;ent, with whom they &s;hook hands, as they did with each other, previous to the la&s;t mo|ments of their exi&s;tence.</P>
