<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>All of us having arrived at Paris, on the evening of the fourth in&s;t, on the next day we verbally and unofficially informed the mini&s;ter of &s;e|reign affairs therewith, and de&s;ired to know when he would be at lei&s;ure to receive one of our &s;ecretaries with the official notification: he appoint|ed the next day at two o'clock; when Major Rutledge waited on him with the following letter:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>To this letter the mini&s;ter gave a verbal an&s;wer, that he would &s;ee us the day after the morrow (the 8th) at one o'clock. Accordingly at that hour, and day, we waited on the mini&s;ter, at his hou&s;e, where his office is held, when, being informed he was not at home, the &s;ecretary-general of the department told Major Rutledge, that the mini&s;ter was obliged to wait on the directory, and reque&s;ted we would &s;u&s;pend our vi&s;ii 'till three o'clock. At which hour we called. The mini&s;ter we found was then engaged with the Portugue&s;e mini&s;ter, who retired in about ten minutes, when we were introduced, and produced the copy of our letters of credence, which the mini&s;ter peru&s;ed and kept. He in|formed us, <Q>that the directory had required him to make a report rela|tive to the &s;ituation of the United States with regard to France, which he was then about, and which would be fini&s;hed in a few days, when he would let us know what &s;teps were to follow.</Q> We a&s;ked if cards of ho&s;pitality were in the mean time nece&s;&s;ary? He &s;aid they were, and
<PB N="6" REF="034817_0005_0FFF8404727E8F38">that they &s;hould be delivered to us; and he immediately rung for his &s;e|cretary and directed him to make them out. The conver&s;ation was car|ried on by him in French, and by us in our own language.</P>
<P>The next day cards of ho&s;pitality were &s;ent to us and our &s;ecretaries, in a &s;tyle &s;uitable to our official character.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 14th, Major Mountflorence informed General Pinck|ney, that he had a conver&s;ation with Mr. O&s;mond, the private and con|fidential &s;ecretary of the mini&s;ter of foreign affairs, who told him, that the directory were greatly exa&s;perated at &s;ome parts of the Pre&s;idents &s;peech, at the opening of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of congre&s;s, and would re|quire an explanation of them from us. The particular parts were not mentioned. In another conver&s;ation, on the &s;ame day, the &s;ecretary informed the major, that the mini&s;ter had told him it was probable we &s;hould not have a public audience of the directory, 'till &s;uch time as our negociation was fini&s;hed, that probably per&s;ons might be appointed to treat with us, but they would report to him, and he would have the di|rection of the negociation. The major did not conceal from Mr. O&s;|mond his intention to communicate the&s;e conver&s;ations to us.</P>
<P>In the morning of October the 18th, Mr. W... of the hou&s;e of ... called on General Pinckney, and informed him, that a Mr. X. who was in Paris, and who the General had &s;een ..... was a gentleman of con&s;iderable credit and reputation ..... and that we might place great reliance on him.</P>
<P>In the evening of the &s;ame day Mr. X. called on General Pinckney, and after having &s;at &s;ome time ... whi&s;pered him, that he had a me&s;&s;age from M. Talleyrand to communicate, when he was at lei&s;ure. General Pinckney immediately withdrew with him into another room; and when they were alone, Mr X. &s;aid, that he was charged with a bu|&s;ine&s;s in which he was a novice; that he had been acquainted with M. Talleyrand ..... and that he was &s;ure he had a great regard for [America] and its citizens; and was very de&s;irous, that a reconcilia|tion &s;hould be brought about with France; that to effectuate that end, he was ready, if it was thought proper, to &s;ugge&s;t a plan, confidential|ly, that M. Talleyrand expected would an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. General Pinckney &s;aid he &s;hould be glad to hear it. M. X. replied, that the di|rectory, and particularly two of the members of it, were exceedingly irritated at &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech, and de&s;ired that they &s;hould be &s;oftened; and that this &s;tep would be nece&s;&s;ary previous to our reception: that be&s;ides this, <HI>a &s;um of money was required, for the pocket of the Directory and Mini&s;ters, which would be at the di&s;po&s;al of M. Talley|rand:</HI> and that a loan would al&s;o be in&s;i&s;ted on. M. X. &s;aid, if we ex|ceeded to the&s;e mea&s;ures, M. Talleyrand had no doubt that all our differ|ences with France might be accommodated. On enquiry M. X. could not point out the particular pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;peech that had given offence, nor the quantum of the loan; but mentioned that the <HI>douceur,</HI> for the pocket, was twelve hundred thou&s;and livres, about fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. General Pinckney told him, his colleagues and him&s;elf, from the time of their arrival here, had been treated with great &s;light and di&s;re&s;pect; that
<PB N="7" REF="034817_0006_0FFF842B933148C8">they earne&s;tly wi&s;hed for peace and reconciliation with France; and had been entru&s;ted by their country with very great powers-to obtain the&s;e ends, on honorable terms: that with regard to the propo&s;itions made, he could not even con&s;ider of them before he had communicated them to his colleagues: that after he had done &s;o, he &s;hould hear from him. After a communication and con&s;ulation had, it was agreed, that General Pinckney &s;hould call on M. X. and reque&s;t him to make his propo&s;itions to us all; and for fear of mi&s;takes, or mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, that he &s;hould be reque&s;ted to reduce the heads into writing. Accordingly, on the morn|ing of October the nineteenth, General Pinckney called on M. X. who con&s;ented to &s;ee his colleagues in the evening, and to reduce his propo&s;i|tions to writing. He &s;aid his communication was not immediately with M. Talleyrand, but through another gentleman, in whom M. Talley|rand had great confidence: this proved afterwards to be M. Y.</P>
<P>At &s;ix in the evening M. X. came and left with us the fir&s;t &s;et of pro|po&s;itions; which, tran&s;lated from the French are as follows: <Q>A per|&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the confidence of the directory, on what relates to the affairs of America, convinced of the mutual advantages which would re&s;ult from the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the good under&s;tanding between the two nations, propo&s;es to employ all of his influence to obtain this object. He will affi&s;t the commi&s;&s;ioners of the United States in all the demands which they may have to make from the go|vernment of France, ina&s;much as they may not be contradictory to tho&s;e which he propo&s;es him&s;elf to make, and of which the principal will be communicated confidentially. It is de&s;ired that in the official com|munications there &s;hould be given a &s;oftening turn to a part of the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech to congre&s;s, which has cau&s;ed much irritation. It is feared that in not &s;atisfying certain individuals in this re&s;pect, they may give way to all their re&s;entment. The nomination of commi&s;&s;i|oners will be con&s;ented to on the &s;ame footing as they have been na|med in the treaty with England, to decide on the reclamations which individuals may make on the government of France, or on French individuals. The payment which, agreeably to the deci&s;ions of the commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;hall fall to the &s;hare of the French government, are to be advanced by the American government it&s;elf. It is de&s;ired that the funds which by this means &s;hall enter again into the American trade &s;hould be employed in new &s;upplies for the French colonies. Engagements of this nature, on the part of individuals, reclaiming will always ha&s;ten, in all probability, the deci&s;ions of the French commi&s;&s;ioners: And perhaps it may be de&s;ired that this clau&s;e &s;hould make a part of the in&s;tructions which the government of the Uni|ted States &s;hould give to the commi&s;&s;ioners they may choo&s;e. The French governmen de&s;ires, be&s;ides to obtain a loan from the United States; but &s;o that that &s;hould not give any jealou&s;y to the Engli&s;h government, nor hurt the neutrality of the United States. This loan &s;hall be <HI>ma&s;ked</HI> by &s;tipulating, that the government of the Uni|ted States con&s;ents to make the advances for the payment of the debts contracted by the agents of the French government with the citizens
<PB N="8" REF="034817_0007_0FFF842D1A97CCE0">of the United States; and which are already acknowledged, and the payment ordered by the directory, but without having been yet ef|fectuated.&mdash;There &s;hould be delivered a note to the amount of the&s;e debts. Probably this note may be accompanied by o&s;ten&s;ible pieces, which will guarantee to the agents, the re&s;pon&s;ibility of the United States, in ca&s;e any umbrage &s;hould cau&s;e an enquiry. There &s;hall al&s;o be taken from this loan certain &s;ums for the purpo&s;e of making the cu&s;tomary di&s;tributions in diplomatic affairs.</Q> The per&s;on of note mentioned in the minutes, who had the confidence of the directory, he &s;aid, <HI>before as all,</HI> was M. Talleyrand. The amount of the loan he could not a&s;certain preci&s;ely, but under&s;tood it would be <HI>according to our ability to pay.</HI> The &s;um which would be con&s;idered as proper, according to the diplomatic u&s;age, was about twelve hundred thou&s;and livres. He could not &s;tate to us what parts of the pre&s;ident's &s;peech were excepted to, but &s;aid he would enquire and inform us. He agreed to breakfa&s;t with Mr. Gerry the morning of the 21&s;t, in order to make &s;uch explanations as we had then reque&s;ted, or &s;hould think pro|per to reque&s;t: But on the morning of the 20th M. X. called and &s;aid, that M. Y. the confidential friend of M. Talleyrand, in&s;tead of com|municating with us through M. X. would &s;ee us him&s;elf, and make the nece&s;&s;ary explanations. We appointed to meet him the evening of the twentieth, at &s;even o'clock, in General Mar&s;hall's room. At &s;even M. Y. and M. X. entered; and the fir&s;t mentioned gentleman, being introdu|ced to us as the <HI>confidential friend</HI> of M. Talleyrand, immediately &s;ta|ted to us the favorable impre&s;&s;ions of that gentleman to our country, impre&s;&s;ions which were made by the <HI>kindne&s;s</HI> and <HI>civilities</HI> he had per|&s;onally received in America: That impre&s;&s;ed by his &s;ollicitude to repay the&s;e kindne&s;&s;es, he was willing to aid us in the pre&s;ent negociation by his good offices with the Directory, who were, he &s;aid, extremely irri|tated again&s;t the government of the United States, on account of &s;ome parts of the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech, and who had neither acknowledged not received us, and con&s;equently have not authorized M. Talleyrand to have any communication with us. The mini&s;ter therefore could not &s;ee us him&s;elf, but had authorized his friend M. Y. to communicate to us certain propo&s;itions, and to receive our an&s;wers to them&mdash;and to pro|mi&s;e on his part, that if we would engage to con&s;ider them as the ba&s;is of the propo&s;ed negociation, <HI>he would intercede with the Directory</HI> to acknowledge us, and give us a public audience. M. Y. &s;tated to us explicitly, and repeatedly, that he was cloathed with no authority; that he was not a diplomatic character; that he was not ... ... he was only the friend of M. Talleyrand and tru&s;ted by him; that with regard to him&s;elf he had ..... ............. and that he wi&s;hed well to the United States. He then took out of his pocket a French tran&s;lation of the pre&s;ident's &s;peech, the parts of which objected to by the directory were marked, agreeably to our reque&s;t to M. X. and are contained in the exhibit A. Then he made us the &s;e|cond &s;et of propo&s;itions, which were dictated by him and written by
<PB N="9" REF="034817_0008_0FFF842EC69F4830">M. X. in our pre&s;ence, and delivered to us, and which, tran&s;lated from the French, are as follows <Q>There is demanded a formal di&s;avowal, in writing, declaring that the &s;peech of the citizen, Pre&s;ident Barras, did not contain any thing offen&s;ive to the government of the United States, nor any thing which de&s;erved the epithets contained in the who&s;e paragraph: &s;econdly, reparation is demanded for the article by which it &s;hall be declared, that the decree of the Directory there mentioned, did not contain any thing contrary to the treaty of 1778, and had none of tho&s;e fatal con&s;equences that the paragraph re|proaches to it: Thirdly, it is demanded that there &s;hould be an ac|knowledgment in writing of the depredations exerci&s;ed on our trade, by the Engli&s;h and French privateers: Fourthly, the government of France, faithful to the profe&s;&s;ion of public faith which it has made not to inter|meddle in the internal affairs of foreign governments, with which it is at peace, would look upon this paragraph as an attack upon its loyalty, if this was intended by the Pre&s;ident. It demands, in con&s;equence, a formal declaration, that it is not the government of France, nor its agents, that this paragraph meant to de&s;ignate: In con&s;ideration of the&s;e reparations, the French Republic is di&s;po&s;ed to renew with the United States of America, a treaty which &s;hall place them reciprocal|ly in the &s;ame &s;tate that they were in 1778. By this new treaty, France &s;hall be placed, with re&s;pect to the United States, exactly on the &s;ame footing as they &s;tand with England, in virtue of the la&s;t treaty which has been concluded between them. <HI>A &s;ecret article of this new treaty would be a loan to be made by the United States to the French Republic;</HI> and once agreed upon the amount of the loan, it would be endeavour|ed to con&s;ult the convenience of the United States with re&s;pect to the be&s;t method of <HI>preventing its publicity.</HI> On reading the &s;peech M. Y. dilated very much upon the keenne&s;s of the re&s;entment it had produced, and expatiated largely on the &s;atisfaction he &s;aid was in|di&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary as a preliminary to negociation. <HI>But &s;aid he, gentlemen, I will not di&s;gui&s;e from you, that, this &s;atisfaction being made, the e&s;&s;ential part of the treaty remains to be adju&s;ted:</HI> il faut de d'argent &mdash;il faut beaucoup d'argent: <HI>You mu&s;t pay money, you mu&s;t pay a great deal of money.</HI></Q> He &s;poke much of the force, the honor, and the jealous republican pride of France; and repre&s;ented to us &s;trongly the advantages which we &s;hould derive from the neutrality, thus to be purcha&s;ed. He &s;aid that the receipt of the money might be &s;o <HI>di&s;gui&s;ea,</HI> as to prevent its being con&s;idered as a breach of neutrality by England; and thus &s;ave us from being embrolled with that power. Concerning the <HI>twelve hundred thou&s;and livres</HI> little was &s;aid; that being completely under&s;tood on all &s;ides, to be required for the <HI>officers of government,</HI> and therefore needing no farther explanation.&mdash;The&s;e propo&s;itions, he &s;aid, being con&s;idered as the admitted ba&s;is of the propo&s;ed treaty. M. Tal|leyrand tru&s;ted that, by his influence with the directory, he could prevail on the government to receive us. We a&s;ked, whether we were to con&s;ider it as certain that, without a previous &s;tipalation to the effect required, we were not to be received. He an&s;wered, that M. Talleyrand him&s;elf was
<PB N="10" REF="034817_0009_0FFF8405F8E421F8">not authorized to &s;peak to us, the will of the Directory, and con&s;e|quently could not authorize him. The conver&s;ation continued until half pa&s;t nine, when they left us; having engaged to breakfa&s;t with Mr. Gerry the next morning.</P>
<P>October 21&s;t, M. X. came before nine o'clock: M. Y. did not come until ten&mdash;<HI>he had passed the morning with M. Talleyrand.</HI> After breakfa&s;t the &s;ubject was immediately re&s;umed. He repre&s;ented to us that we were not yet acknowledged or received; that the Direc|tory were &s;o exa&s;perated again&s;t the United States, <HI>as to have come to a determination</HI> to demand from us, previous to our reception, tho&s;e di&s;avowals, reparations and explanations, which were &s;tated at large, la&s;t evening. He &s;aid, that M. Talleyrand, and him&s;elf, were extreme|ly &s;en&s;ible of the pain we mu&s;t feel, in complying with this demand; but that the directory would not di&s;pen&s;e with it; that therefore we mu&s;t con&s;ider it as the indi&s;pen&s;ible preliminary to obtain our reception; unle&s;s we could find the means to change their determination in this particular; that if we &s;atisfied the Directory in the&s;e particulars, a let|ter would be written to us to demand the extent of our powers, and to know whether we were authorized to place them preci&s;ely on the &s;ame footing with England;&mdash;whether, he &s;aid, our full powers were really and &s;ub&s;tantially full powers; or, like tho&s;e of lord Malme&s;bury, only illu&s;ory powers; that, if to this demand our an&s;wer &s;hould be affirma|tive, then France would con&s;ent that commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be appoint|ed to a&s;certain the claims of the United States, in like manner as under our treaty with England; <HI>but from their juri&s;diction mu&s;t be withdrawn tho&s;e which were condemned for want of a role d'equipage;</HI> that being a point on which Merlin, while mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice, had written a treati&s;e, and on which the Directory were decided. There would however be no objection to our <HI>complaining</HI> of the&s;e captures in the cour&s;e of the nego|ciation, and if we could convince Merlin by our rea&s;oning, the mini&s;|ter would him&s;elf be &s;atisfied with our &s;o doing. We required an ex|planation of that part of the conver&s;ation, in which M. Y. had hinted at our finding means to avert the demand concerning the pre&s;ident's &s;peech. He an&s;wered, that he was not authorized to &s;tate tho&s;e means, but that <HI>we mu&s;t &s;earch for them and propo&s;e them our&s;elves.</HI> If however we a&s;ked his opinion as a private individual, and would receive it as coming from him, he would &s;ugge&s;t to us the means, which in his opini|on, would &s;ucceed. On being a&s;ked to &s;ugge&s;t the means, he an&s;wered MONEY; that the Directory were jealous of its own honor, and of the ho|nor of the nation; that it in&s;i&s;ted on receiving from us the &s;ame re&s;pect with which we had treated the king; that this honor mu&s;t be maintained in the manner before required, unle&s;s we &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of tho&s;e reparations &s;omething perhaps more valuable, that was, <HI>money.</HI>&mdash;He &s;aid further, that if we de&s;ired him to point out the &s;um which he be|lieved would be &s;atisfactory, he would do &s;o. We reque&s;ted him to proceed; and he &s;aid, that there were <HI>thirty-two millions of florins</HI> of Dutch in&s;criptions, worth ten &s;hillings in the pound which might be a&s;&s;igned to us at 20 <ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> in the pound; and he proceeded to &s;tate to us the
<PB N="11" REF="034817_0010_0FFF8407878E3440">certainty, that after a peace, the Dutch government would repay us the money; &s;o that we &s;hould ultimately loo&s;e nothing; and the only ope|ration of the mea&s;ure would be an advance from us to France of thirty-two millions, on the credit of the government of Holland. We a&s;ked him whether the fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, as a <HI>douceur</HI> to the Directory, mu&s;t be in addition to this &s;um. He an&s;wered in the affirma|tive. We had no he&s;itation in &s;aying that our powers were ample: that on the other points propo&s;ed to us we would retire into another room, and return in a few minutes with our an&s;wer. We committed immedi|ately to writing the an&s;wer we propo&s;ed, in the following words: <Q>Our powers, re&s;pecting a treaty, are ample: But the propo&s;ition of a loan in the form of Dutch in&s;criptions, or in any other form, is not within the limits of our in&s;tructions; upon this point therefore the government mu&s;t be con&s;ulted; one of the American mini&s;ters will, for the purpo&s;e, forthwith embark for America: Provided the direc|tory will &s;u&s;pend all further captures on American ve&s;&s;els, and will &s;u&s;pend proceedings on tho&s;e already captured, as well where they have been already condemned, as where the deci&s;ions have not yet been rendered; and that where &s;ales have been made, but the money not yet received by the captors, it &s;hall not be paid until the preli|minary que&s;tions, propo&s;ed to the mini&s;ters of the United States, be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and decided;</Q> which was read as a verbal an&s;wer; and we told them they might copy it, if they plea&s;ed. M. Y. refu&s;ed to do &s;o: His di&s;appointment was apparent; he &s;aid we treated the money part of the propo&s;ition as if it had proceeded from the Directory; whereas in fact it did not proceed even from the mini&s;ter, but was only a &s;ugge&s;tion from him&s;elf, as a &s;ub&s;titute to be propo&s;ed by us, in or|der to avoid the painful acknowledgment that the Directory had deter|mined to demand of us. It was told him, that we under&s;tood that matter perfectly; that we knew the propo&s;ition was in form to be ours: but that it came <HI>substantially from the minister.</HI> We a&s;ked what had led to our pre&s;ent conver&s;ation? And General Pinckney then repeated the fir&s;t communication from M. X. (to the whole of which that gen|tleman a&s;&s;ented) and we ob&s;erved that tho&s;e gentlemen had brought no te&s;timonials of their &s;peaking any thing from authority; but that rely|ing on the fair characters they bore, <HI>we believed them when they &s;aid they were from the mini&s;ter, and had conver&s;ed with them in like manner, as if we were conver&s;ing with M. Talleyrand him&s;elf; and that we could not con|&s;ider any &s;ugge&s;tion M. Y. had made, as not having been previou&s;ly approved of:</HI> But yet if he did not choo&s;e to take a memorandum in writing of our an&s;wer, we had no wi&s;h that he &s;hould do &s;o; And further, if he cho&s;e to give the an&s;wer to his propo&s;ition, the form of a propo&s;ition from our&s;elves, we could only tell him, that we had no other propo&s;i|on to make, relative to any advance of money on our part; that Ame|rica had &s;u&s;tained deep and heavy lo&s;&s;es, by French depredations on our commerce, and that France had alledged &s;o [many] complaints again&s;t the United States, that on tho&s;e &s;ubjects we came fully prepared, and were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find France unwilling to hear us; and ma|king
<PB N="12" REF="034817_0011_0FFF840A5AB9FAE0">demands upon us, which could never have been &s;u&s;pected by our government, and which had the appearance of our being the aggre&s;&s;ing party. M. Y. expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf vehemently on the re&s;entment of France; and complained, that in&s;tead of our propo&s;ing &s;ome &s;ub&s;titute for the reparations demanded of us, we were &s;tipulating certain condi|tions to be performed by the Directory it&s;elf; that he could not take charge of &s;uch propo&s;itions; and that the Directory would per&s;i&s;t in its demand of tho&s;e reparations which he at fir&s;t &s;tated. We an&s;wered, that we could not help it: It was for the Directory to determine what cour&s;e its own honor and the intere&s;ts of France required it to pur&s;ue: <HI>It was for us to guard the intere&s;ts and honor of our country.</HI> M. Y. ob&s;er|ved, that we had taken no notice of the fir&s;t propo&s;ition, which was, to know whether we were ready to make the di&s;avowal, reparations, and explanations concerning the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech. We told him that we &s;uppo&s;ed it to be impo&s;&s;ible, that either he, or the mini&s;ter, could ima|gine, that &s;uch a propo&s;ition could require an an&s;wer: That we did not under&s;tand it as being &s;eriou&s;ly expected; but merely as introductory to the &s;ubjects of real con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>He &s;poke of the re&s;pect which the Directory required, and repeated, that it would exact <HI>as much as was paid to the ancient Kings.</HI> We an&s;wer|ed that america had demon&s;trated to all the world, and e&s;pecially to France, a much greater re&s;pect for her pre&s;ent government than for her former monarchy; and that there was no evidence of this di&s;po&s;ition which ought to be required, that we were not ready to give. He &s;aid, that we &s;hould certainly not be received; and &s;eemed to &s;hudder at the con&s;equences. We told him, that America had made every po&s;&s;ible ef|fort to remain on friendly terms with France; that &s;he was &s;till making them: That if France would not hear us; but would make war on the United States; nothing remained for us, <HI>but to regret the unavoidable ne|cece&s;&s;ity of defending our&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ubject or our powers was again mentioned; and we told him, that America was &s;olicitous to have no more mi&s;under&s;tandings with any republic, but e&s;pecially with France; that &s;he wi&s;hed a permanent trea|ty, and was &s;en&s;ible, that no treaty, could be permanent, which did not comport with the intere&s;ts of the pacties; and therefore, that he might be a&s;&s;ured, that our powers were &s;uch as authorized us to place France <HI>on equal ground with England,</HI> in any re&s;pects in which an inequa|lity might be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t at pre&s;ent between them, to the di&s;advan|tage of France. The &s;ubject of the r&ocirc;le d'&eacute;quipage was al&s;o mention|ed; and we a&s;ked what a&s;&s;urance we could have, if France in&s;i&s;ted on the right of adding to the &s;tipulations of our treaty, or of altering them by municipal regulations, that any future treaty, we could make, &s;hould be ob&s;erved. M. Y. &s;aid that he did not a&s;&s;ert the principle of changing treaties by municipal regulations; but that the Directory con|&s;idered its regulation concerning the r&ocirc;le d'&eacute;quipage as comporting with the treaty. We ob&s;erved to him, <HI>that none of our ve&s;&s;els had what the French termed a r&ocirc;le d'&eacute;quipage,</HI> and that if we were to &s;urrender all the property, which had been taken from our citizens, in ca&s;es where their
<PB N="13" REF="034817_0012_0FFF8432275A3FD0">ve&s;&s;els were not furni&s;hed with &s;uch a r&ocirc;le the government would be re&s;pon&s;ible to its citizens, for the property &s;o &s;urrendered; &s;ince it would be impo&s;&s;ible to undertake to a&s;&s;ert that there was any plau&s;ibility in the allegation, that our treaty required a r&ocirc;le d'&eacute;quipage.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of di&s;avowals, &amp;c. concerning the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech was again mentioned; and it was ob&s;erved, <HI>that the con&s;titution of the United States, authorized and required our Pre&s;ident to communicate his ideas on the affairs of the nation; that, in obedience to this con&s;titution, he had done &s;o; that we had not power to confirm or invalidate any part of the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech:</HI> that &s;uch an attempt could produce no other effect than to make us ridiculous to the government, and to the citizens at large of the Uni|ted States; and to produce, on the part of the Pre&s;ident, an immediate di&s;avowal and recal of us, as his agents: That independent of this, all America was acquainted with the facts &s;tated by the Pre&s;ident; and our di&s;avowing them would not change the public &s;entiment concerning them.</P>
<P>We parted with mutual profe&s;&s;ions of per&s;onal re&s;pect, and with full indications, on the part of M. Y. of his expectation, that we &s;hould immediately receive the threatened letter.</P>
<P>The nature of the above communication will evince the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ecrecy; and we have promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;rs. X. and Y. that their <HI>names &s;hall, in no event, be made public.</HI></P>

<P>P. S. October 27th, 1797. The definitive articles of peace are &s;igned between the French republic and the Emperor: The particulars you will find in the public prints. The Portugue&s;e mini&s;ter is ordered to quit France, as the treaty with Portugal has not been yet ratified by the Queen. The treaty it&s;elf is declared by the Directory to be void. Since our arrival at Paris the tribunal of ca&s;&s;ation has rejected captain Scott's petition, complaining of the condemnation of his ve&s;&s;el, by the civil tribunal for the want of a r&ocirc;le d'&eacute;quipage. Mr.&mdash;in behalf of the owners of the American ve&s;&s;els, who have appealed in the la&s;t re&s;ort to the tribunal of ca&s;&s;ation, informs, that notwith&s;tanding all the arguments&mdash;made u&s;e of&mdash;to put off the hearing of the Ro&s;anna, as a diplomatic ca&s;e, till the i&s;&s;ue of our negociations is known, that ca&s;e is &s;et down for hearing, and will come on the 29th or 30th in&s;t. The &s;ame&mdash;al&s;o &s;ays, that it is obvious, that the tribu|nal have received in&s;tructions from the officers of government to ha&s;ten their deci&s;ions, and that it was hardly worth while to&mdash;for all our petitions in ca&s;&s;ation would be rejected.

<HEAD>Paragraph's of the <HI>PRESIDENT's</HI> Speech, referred to in Letter No. <HI>I,</HI> under the title of exbibit <HI>A.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. With this conduct of the French government it will be proper to take into view the public audience, given to the late mini&s;ter of the United States, on his taking leave of the Executive Directory. The &s;peech of the Pre&s;ident di&s;clo&s;es &s;entiments more alarming than the refu|&s;al of a mini&s;ter becau&s;e more dangerous to our independence and union, and at the &s;ame time &s;tudiou&s;ly marked with indignities again&s;t the go|vernment of the United States, It evinces a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eparate the people of the United States from the government; to per&s;uade them, that they have different affections, principles and intere&s;ts from tho&s;e of their fellow citizens, whom they, them&s;elves, have cho&s;en to manage their common concerns; and thus to produce divi&s;ions fatal to our peace. Such attempts ought to be repelled with a deci&s;&s;ion, which &s;hall con|vince France, and the world, that we are not a degraded people, humi|liated under a colonial &s;en&s;e of fear, fitted to be the mi&s;erable in&s;tru|ments of foreign influence, and regardle&s;s of national honor, character, and intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">II. The diplomatic intercour&s;e between France and the United States, be|ing at pre&s;ent &s;u&s;pended, the government has no means of obtaining of|ficial information from that country; neverthele&s;s there is rea&s;on to be|lieve, that the Executive Directory pa&s;&s;ed a decree, on the 2d of March la&s;t, contravening in part the treaty of amity and commerce of 1778, injurious to our lawful commerce, and endangering the lives of our ci|tizens. A copy of this decree will be laid before you.</P>
<P N="3">III. While we are endeavouring to adju&s;t our differences with France, by amicable negociation, the progre&s;s of the war in Europe, the depre|dations on our commerce, the per&s;onal injuries to our citizens, and the general complexion of affairs, render it my indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to recom|mend to your con&s;ideration effectual mea&s;ures of defence.</P>
<P N="4">IV. It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceal from our&s;elves, or the world, what has been before ob&s;erved, that endeavors have been employed to fo&s;ter and e&s;ta|bli&s;h a divi&s;ion between the government and the people of the United States. To inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es which have encouraged this attempt is not nece&s;&s;ary. But to repel, by decided and united councils, in&s;inuations &s;o derogatory to the honor, and aggre&s;&s;ions &s;o dangerous to the con&s;titution, union, and even the independence of the nation, is an indi&s;pen&s;able duty.</P>

<P>Mr. Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary of the United States of America.</P>
<P>By pre&s;enting to-day your let|ters of recall to the Executive Di|rectory, you give to Europe a ve|ry &s;trange &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>France, rich in her liberty, &s;ur|rounded by a croud of victories, &s;trong in the e&s;teem of her allies, will not aba&s;e her&s;elf by calcula|ting the con&s;equences of the con|de&s;cen&s;ion of the American govern|ment to the &s;ugge&s;tions of her for|mer tyrants&mdash;Moreover the French Republic hopes, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Columbus, Ramhimph * and Penn, always proud of their liber|ty, will never forget, that they owe it to France. They will weigh in their wi&s;dom, the mag|nanimous benevolence of the French people, with the crafty ca|re&s;&s;es of certain perfidious per&s;ons, who meditate bringing them back to their former &s;lavery. A&s;&s;ure the good American people, &s;ir, that like them we adore liberty; that they will always have our e&s;teem, and that they wil find in the French people republican genero&s;ity, which knows how to grant peace, as it does to cau&s;e its &s;overeignty to be re&s;pected.</P>
<P>As to you, Mr. Mini&s;ter Pleni|potentiary, you have combatted for principles, you have known the true intere&s;ts of your country. Depart with our regret.

<P>About twelve we received another vi&s;it from M. X. He immediately mentioned the great event announced in the papers, and then &s;aid, that &s;ome propo&s;als from us had been expected on the &s;ubject on which we had before conver&s;ed; that the Directory were becoming impatient, and would take a decided cour&s;e with regard to America, if we could not &s;often them. We an&s;wered, that on that &s;ubject we had already &s;poken explicitly, and had nothing further to add. He mentioned the change in the &s;tate of things, which had been produced by the peace with the emperor, as warranting an expectation of a change in our &s;y&s;tem; to which we only replied, that this event had been expected by us, and would not, in any degree affect our conduct. M. X. <HI>urged that the Direc|tory bad, &s;ince this peace, taken a higher and more decidea tone, with re&s;pect to us and all other neutral nations, than had been before taken; that it had been determined, that all nations &s;hould aid them, or be con&s;idered and treated as their enemies.</HI> We an&s;wered, that &s;uch an effect had already been con|templated by us as probable, and had not been overlooked when we gave to this propo&s;ition our decided an&s;wer; and further, that we had no powers to negociate for a loan of money; that our government had not contem|plated &s;uch a circum&s;tance in any degree whatever; that if we &s;hould &s;ti|pulate a loan, it would be a perfectly void thing, and would only deceive France and expo&s;e our&s;elves. M. X. again expatiated on the power and violence of France: he urged the danger of our &s;ituation, and pre&s;&s;ed the policy of &s;oftening them, and of thereby obtaining time. The pre|&s;ent men, he &s;aid, would, very probably, not continue long in power; and it would be very unfortunate, if tho&s;e, who might &s;ucceed, with bet|ter di&s;po&s;itions towards us, &s;hould find the two nations in actual war. We an&s;wered, that if war &s;hould be made on us, by France, it would be &s;o obviou&s;ly forced on us, that on a change of men, peace might be made with as much facility as the pre&s;ent differences could be accommodated: we added, that all America deprecated a war with France; but that our pre&s;ent &s;ituation was more ruinous to us than a declared war could he; that at pre&s;ent our commerce was plundered unprotected; but that if war was declared, we &s;hould &s;eek the means of protection. M. X. &s;aid, he hoped we &s;hould not form a connection with Britain; and we an&s;wered, that we hoped &s;o too; that we had all been engaged in our revolution war, and felt its injuries; that it had made the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on us; but that if France &s;hould attack us, we mu&s;t &s;eek the be&s;t means of &s;elf de|fence.
<PB N="17" REF="034817_0016_0FFF840C05129968">M. X. again returned to the &s;ubject of money: &s;aid he, <HI>gentle|men, you do not speak to the point; it is money:</HI> it is expected that you will offer money. We &s;aid, that we had &s;poken to that point very expli|citly: we had given an an&s;wer. No, &s;aid he, you have not; what is your an&s;wer? We replied; IT IS NO; NO; NOT A SIXPENCE. He again called our attention to the dangers which threatened our coun|try, and a&s;ked, if it would not be prudent, though we might not make a loan to the nation, to intere&s;t an influential friend in our favor. He &s;aid, <HI>we ought to con&s;ider what men we had to treat with; that they di&s;re|garded the ju&s;tice of our claims, and the rea&s;oning with which we might &s;upport them; that they di&s;regarded their own colonies; and con&s;idered them|&s;elves as perfectly invulnerable with re&s;pect to us; that we could only acquire an intere&s;t among them by a judicious application of money; and it was for us to con&s;ider whether the &s;ituation of our country did not require that the means &s;hould be re&s;orted to.</HI> We ob&s;erved, that the conduct of the French government was &s;uch, as to leave us much rea&s;on to fear, that &s;hould we give the money, it would effect no good purpo&s;e, and would not produce a ju&s;t mode of thinking with re&s;pect to us. Proof of this mu&s;t fir&s;t be given us. He &s;aid, that when we employed a lawyer we gave him a fee, without knowing whether the cau&s;e would be gained or not; but it was nece&s;&s;ary to have one, and we paid for his &s;ervices, whether tho&s;e &s;ervices were &s;ucce&s;sful or not: &s;o in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, the money mu&s;t be advanced for the good offices the individuals were to ren|der, whatever might be the effect of tho&s;e good offices. We told him there was no parallel in the ca&s;es; that a lawyer not being to render the judgment, could not command &s;ucce&s;s: he could only endeavor to ob|tain it; and con&s;equently we could only pay him for his endeavors: but the Directory could decide on the i&s;&s;ue of our negociation. It had only to order that no more American ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be &s;eized, and to direct tho&s;e now in cu&s;tody to be re&s;tored, and there could be no oppo&s;ition to the order. He &s;aid, that all the members of the Directory were not di&s;|po&s;ed to receive our money: that MERLIN, for in&s;tance, was paid from <HI>another quarter,</HI> and would touch no part of the douceur which was to come from us. We replied, that we had under&s;tood that Merlin was paid by the owners of the privateers; and he nodded an a&s;&s;ent to the fact. He proceeded to pre&s;s this &s;ubject with va&s;t per&s;everance. He told us that we paid money to obtain peace with the Algerines, and with the In|dians; <HI>and that it was doing no more to pay France for peace.</HI> To this it was an&s;wered, that when our government commenced a treaty with ei|ther Algiers, or the Indian tribes, it was under&s;tood that money was to form the ba&s;is of the treaty, and was its e&s;&s;ential article; that the whole nation knew it, and was prepared to expect it as a thing of cour&s;e; but that in treating with France, our government had &s;uppo&s;ed that a propo|&s;ition, &s;uch as he &s;poke of, would, <HI>if made by us,</HI> give mortal offence. He a&s;ked if our government did not know, that nothing was to be obtained here without money? We replied, that our government had not even &s;u&s;pected &s;uch a &s;tate of things. He appeared &s;urpri&s;ed at it, and &s;aid,
<PB N="18" REF="034817_0017_0FFF843C6AED4DB8">there was not an American, in Paris, who could not have given that in|formation. We told him that the letters of our mini&s;ter had indicated a very contrary temper in the government of France; and had repre&s;ented it as acting entirely upon principle, and as feeling a very pure and di&s;inter|e&s;ted affection for America. <HI>He looked &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed,</HI> and &s;aid bri&s;k|ly to General Pinckney: well &s;ir, you have been a long time in France, and in Holland; what do you think of it? General Pinckney an&s;wered, that he con&s;idered M. X. and M. Y. as men of truth, and of con&s;equence he could have but one opinion on the &s;ubject. He &s;tated, that Ham|burgh and other &s;tates of Europe were obliged to buy a peace; and that it would be equally for our intere&s;t to do &s;o. Once more he &s;poke of the danger of a breach with France, and of her power which nothing could re&s;i&s;t. We told him that it would be in vain for us to deny her power, or the &s;olicitude we felt to avoid a conte&s;t with it; that no na|tion e&s;timated her power more highly than America, or wi&s;hed more to be on amicable terms with her; but that one object was &s;till dearer to us than the friend&s;hip of France, <HI>which was our national independence;</HI> that America had taken a neutral &s;tation; &s;he had a right to take it; no na|tion had a right to force us out of it; that to lend a &s;um of money to a belligerent power, abounding in every thing requi&s;ite for war, but money, was to relinqui&s;h our neutrality, and take part in the war; to lend this mo|ney under the la&s;h and coercion of France, was to relinqui&s;h the govern|ment of our&s;elves, and to &s;ubmit to a foreign government, impo&s;ed upon us by force; <HI>that we would make at lea&s;t one manly &s;truggle before we thus &s;urrendered our national independence;</HI> that our ca&s;e was different from that of one of the minor nations of Europe; they were unable to maintain their independence, and did not expect to do &s;o: America was a great, and, &s;o far as concerned her &s;elf-defence, a powerful nation; &s;he was able to maintain her independence; and mu&s;t de&s;erve to lo&s;e it, if &s;he permitted it to be wre&s;ted from her; that France and Britain had been at war for near fifty years of the la&s;t hundred, and might probably be at war for fifty years of the centuty to come; that America had no motives which could induce her to involve her&s;elf in tho&s;e wars; and that if &s;he now pre&s;erved her neutrality, and her independence, it was mo&s;t probable that &s;he would not in future be afraid, as &s;he had been for four years pa&s;t; but if &s;he now &s;urrendered her rights of &s;elf government to France, or per|mitted them to be torn from her, &s;he could not expect to recover them, or to remain neutral in any future war. He &s;aid that France had lent us money during our revolution war, and only required that we &s;hould now exhibit the &s;ame friend&s;hip for her. We an&s;wered, that the ca&s;es were very different; that America &s;olicited a loan from France, and left her at liberty to grant or refu&s;e it; but that France <HI>demanded it from America.</HI> And left us no choice on the &s;ubject. We al&s;o told him there was ano|ther difference in the ca&s;es; that the money was lent by France for great national and French objects; it was lent to maim a rival and an enemy whom &s;he hated; that the money, if lent by America, would not be for any American objects, but to enable France to extend &s;till further her con|que&s;ts. The conver&s;ation continued for nearly two hours; and the pub|lic
<PB N="19" REF="034817_0018_0FFF84419C1D6340">and private advance of money was pre&s;&s;ed and repre&s;&s;ed in a variety of forms. At length M. X. &s;aid, that he did not blame us; that our deter|mination was certainly proper, if we could keep it: But he &s;hewed de|cidedly his opinion to be that we could not keep it. He &s;aid, that he would communicate, as nearly as he could, our conver&s;ation to the mini&s;|ter, or to M. Y. to be given by him to the mini&s;ter; we are not certain which. We then &s;eperated. On the 22d of October, M. Z. a French gentleman of re&s;pectable character, informed Mr. Gerry, that M. Tal|leyrand, mini&s;ter of foreign relations, profe&s;&s;ed to be well di&s;po&s;ed to|wards the United States, had expected to have &s;een the American mini&s;ters frequently in their private capacities; and to have conferred with them in|dividually on the objects of their mi&s;&s;ion; and had authorized M. Z. to make this communication to Mr. Gerry. The latter &s;ent for his col|leagues; and a conferrence was held with M. Z. on the &s;ubject; in which General Pinckney and General Mar&s;hall expre&s;&s;ed their opinions, that not being acquainted with M. Talleyrand, they could not, with pro|priety call on him; but that according to the cu&s;tom of France he might expect this of Mr. Gerry, from a previous acquaintance in America. This Mr. Gerry reluctantly complied with on the 23d, and with M. Z. called on M. Talleyrand, who, not being then at his office, appoint|ed the 28th for the interview. After the fir&s;t introduction, M. Talleyrand began the conferrence. He &s;aid, that the Directory had pa&s;|&s;ed an arrete, which he offered for peru&s;al, in which they had demanded of the envoys an explanation of &s;ome parts, and a reparation for others, of the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech to Congre&s;s of the 16th of May la&s;t: he was &s;en&s;ible, he &s;aid, that difficulties would exi&s;t on the part of the envoys re|lative to this demand; but that by their offering money, he thought he could prevent the effect of the arrete. M. Z. at the reque&s;t of Mr. Ger|ry, having &s;tated that the envoys have no &s;uch powers; M. Talleyrand re|plied, they can, in &s;uch ca&s;e, take a power on them&s;elves; and propo&s;ed that they &s;hould make a loan. Mr. Gerry then addre&s;&s;ed M. Talleyrand, di&s;tinctly, in Engli&s;h, which he &s;aid he under&s;tood, and &s;tated, that the unea&s;ine&s;s of the Directory, re&s;ulting from the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech, was a &s;ub|ject unconnected with the objects of the mi&s;&s;ion; that M. Barras, in his &s;peech to Mr. Monroe, on his recall, had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in a manner di&s;plea&s;ing to the government and citizens of the United States; that the Pre&s;ident, as the envoys conceived, had made &s;uch ob&s;ervations on M. Barras' &s;peech as were nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate the honor of the United States; that this was not con&s;idered by our government as a &s;ubject of di&s;|pute between the two nations; that having no in&s;tructions re&s;pecting it, we could not make any explanations, or reparations, relating to it, and that M. Talleyrand, him&s;elf, was &s;ufficiently acquainted with the con&s;titu|tion of the United States to be convinced of the truth of the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions. Mr. Gerry further &s;tated, that the powers of the envoys, as they conceived, were adequate to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and adju&s;tment of all points of real difference between the two nations; that they could alter and a|mend the treaty; or, if nece&s;&s;ary, form a new one; that the United
<PB N="20" REF="034817_0019_0FFF844420E4AF50">States were anxiou&s;ly de&s;irous of removing all cau&s;es of complaint between them&s;elves and France, and of renewing their former friend&s;hip and intercour&s;e, on terms which &s;hould be mutually honorable and be|neficial to the two nations; but not on any other terms; that as to a loan, we had no powers whatever to make one; that if we were to at|tempt it, we &s;hould deceive him&s;elf, and the Directory likewi&s;e, which as men of honor we could not do; but that we could &s;end one of our number for in&s;tructions on this propo&s;ition, if deemed expedient, pro|vided that the other objects of the negociation could be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and ad|ju&s;ted; that as he had expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to confer with the envoys indi|vidually, it was the wi&s;h of Mr. Gerry that &s;uch a conference &s;hould take place, and their opinions thus be a&s;certained, which he conceived, corre&s;ponded with his own in the particulars mentioned. M. Talleyrand, in an&s;wer, &s;aid, he &s;hould be glad to confer with the other envoys, indi|vidually; but that this matter, about <HI>the money,</HI> mu&s;t be &s;ettled directly, <HI>without &s;ending to America;</HI> that he would not communicate the arrete for a week; and that if we could adju&s;t the difficulty re&s;pecting the &s;peech, an application would, neverthele&s;s, go to the United States for a loan. A courier arriving, at this moment, from Italy, and M. Talleyrand ap|pearing impatient to read the letters, Mr. Gerry took leave of him im|mediately. He followed to the door, and de&s;ired M. Z. to repeat to Mr. Gerry what he, M. Tallyrand, had &s;aid to him. Mr. Gerry then returned to his quarters with M. Z. took down the particulars of this in|terview, as before &s;tated, &s;ent for Generals Pinckney and Mar&s;hall, and read it to them in the pre&s;ence of M. Z. who confirmed it. Generals Pinckney and Mar&s;hall then de&s;ired M. Z. to inform M. Talleyrand, that they had nothing to add to this conferrence, and did not wi&s;h that the arrete might be delayed on their account.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 29th.</P>
<P>M. X. again called on us. He &s;aid, M. Talleyrand was extremely anxious to be of &s;ervice to us, and had reque&s;ted, that one more effort &s;hould be made to induce us to enable him to be &s;o. A great deal of the &s;ame con|ver&s;ation, which had pa&s;&s;ed at our former interviews, was repeated. The power and the haughtine&s;s of France was again di&s;played to us. We were told, that the de&s;truction of England was inevitable; and that the wealth and arts of that nation, would naturally pa&s;s over to America, if that event &s;hould find us in peace. To this ob&s;ervation, we replied, that France would probably forbid America to receive them, in like manner as &s;he had forbid Switzerland to permit the re&s;idence, in its country, of a Briti&s;h mini&s;ter. We told him, al&s;o, that we were &s;en&s;ible of the value of peace, and therefore &s;ought it unremittingly, but that it was real peace we &s;ought for, and real peace only which could be de&s;irable.</P>
<P>The &s;um of his propo&s;ition was, that if we would pay, by way of fees (that was his expre&s;&s;ion) the &s;um of money demanded for private u&s;e, the Directory would not receive us! but would permit us to remain in Pa|ris, as we now were; and we &s;hould be received by M. Talleyrand, un|til one of us could go to America, and con&s;ult our government on the &s;ubject of the loan. The&s;e were the circum&s;tances, he &s;aid, under which
<PB N="21" REF="034817_0020_0FFF8436F8B72658">the mini&s;ter of Portugal had treated. We a&s;ked him if, in the mean time, the Directory would order the American property, not yet pa&s;&s;ed into the hands of the privateer&s;men, to be re&s;tored? <HI>He said, explicitly, that they would not.</HI> We a&s;ked him, whether they would &s;u&s;pend further depredations on our commerce? <HI>He said they would not:</HI> but M. Tal|leyrand ob&s;erved, that on this &s;ubject we could not &s;u&s;tain much addition|al injury, becau&s;e the winter &s;ea&s;on was approaching, when few addi|tional captures could be made. We told him, that France had taken violently, from America, more than <HI>fifteen millions of dollars,</HI> and treat|ed us, in every re&s;pect, as enemies, in return for the friend&s;hip we had manife&s;ted for her; that we had come to endeavor to re&s;tore harmony to the two nations, and to obtain compen&s;ation for the injuries our country|men had &s;u&s;tained; and that in lieu of this compen&s;ation, we were told, that if we would pay twelve hundred thou&s;and livres, we might be per|mitted to remain in Paris; which would only give us the benefit of &s;ee|ing the plays and operas of Paris, for the winter, that we might have time to a&s;k from our country <HI>to exhaust her resources</HI> for France, who&s;e de|predations would be continued. He again &s;tated, that by this procedure we &s;hould &s;u&s;pend a war; and that, perhaps, in five or &s;ix months power might change hands.</P>
<P>We told him, that what we wi&s;hed to &s;ee in France, was a temper &s;in|cerely friendly to the United States, and really di&s;po&s;ed to do us ju&s;tice; that if could perceive this, we might not &s;o much regard a little money, &s;uch as he &s;tated to be u&s;ual, although we &s;hould hazard our&s;elves by giv|ing it; but that we &s;aw only evidences of the mo&s;t extreme ho&s;tility to|ward us: war was made upon us &s;o far as France could make it in the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of things; and it was not even propo&s;ed, <HI>that on receiving our money,</HI> this war &s;hould cea&s;e: We had no rea&s;on to believe, that a po&s;&s;i|ble benefit could re&s;ult from it; and we de&s;ired him to &s;ay, that <HI>we would not give a &s;hilling,</HI> unle&s;s American property, unju&s;tly captured, was previou&s;ly re&s;tored, and further ho&s;tilities &s;u&s;pended; and that unle&s;s this was done, we did not conceive that we could con&s;ult our government concerning a loan; that if the Directory would receive us, and com|mence negociations, and any thing occurred, which rendered a con&s;ulta|tion of the government nece&s;&s;ary, one of us would return to America for that purpo&s;e. <HI>He said, that without this money, we &s;hould be obliged to quit Paris,</HI> and that we ought to con&s;ider the con&s;equences: the pro|perty of the Americans would be confi&s;cated, and their ve&s;&s;els, in port, embargoed. We told him, that unle&s;s there was a hope of a reconcilia|tion, the&s;e evils could not be prevented by us; and the little delay we might obtain would only encrea&s;e them; that our mi&s;&s;ion had induced many of our countrymen to tru&s;t their ve&s;&s;els into the ports of France, and that if we remained in Paris, that very circum&s;tance would increa&s;e the number; and con&s;equently the injury, which our countrymen would &s;u&s;tain, if France could permit her&s;elf &s;o to violate her own engage|ments, and the laws of nations. He expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h, <HI>that M. Y. &s;hould see us once more.</HI> We told him, that a vi&s;it from M. Y. as a private gen|tleman, would always be agreeable to us: but if he came only with the
<PB N="22" REF="034817_0021_0FFF8445C8522080">expectation that we &s;hould &s;tipulate advances of money, without previ|ou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;olid and permanent reconciliation, he might &s;ave him&s;elf the trouble of the application, becau&s;e it was a &s;ubject we had con&s;idered maturely, and on which we were immoveable. He parted with us, &s;aying, if that was the ca&s;e, it would not be worth while for M. Y. to come. In the evening, while Gen. Pinckney and Gen. Mar|&s;hall were ab&s;ent, M. Y. and M. X. called, and were invited by Mr. Gerry to breakfa&s;t with us the next morning.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 30th.</P>
<P>Immediately after breakfa&s;t, the &s;ubject was re&s;umed. M. Y. &s;poke without interruption for near an hour. He &s;aid, that he was de&s;iours of making a la&s;t effort to &s;erve us, by propo&s;ing &s;omething which might accommodate the differences between the two nations; that what he was now about to mention, had not, by any means, the approbation of the Directory; nor could M. Talleyrand undertake further than to make from us the propo&s;ition to the Directory, and u&s;e his influence for its &s;ucce&s;s; that la&s;t week, M. Talleyrand could not have ventured to have offered &s;uch propo&s;itions; but that his &s;ituation had been very material|ly changed by the peace with the Emperor: by that peace he had ac|quired, in an high degree, the confidence of the Directory, and now po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed great influence with that body; that he was al&s;o clo&s;ely connected with Buonaparte, and the generals of the army, in Italy; and was to be confidered as firmly fixed in his po&s;t, at lea&s;t for five or &s;ix months: That under the&s;e circum&s;tances, he could undertake to offer, in our be|half, propo&s;itions, which, before this increa&s;e of influence, he could not have hazarded. M. Y. then called our attention to our own &s;ituation, and to the force France was capable of bringing to bear upon us. He &s;aid, that we were the be&s;t judges of our capacity to re&s;i&s;t, &s;o far as de|pended on our own re&s;ources, and ought not to deceive our&s;elves on &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;ubject. <HI>The fate of Venice was one which might befal the United States.</HI> But he proceeded to ob&s;erve, it was probable, we might rely on forming a league with England. If we had &s;uch a reliance it would fail us. The &s;ituation of England was &s;uch, as to compel Pitt to make peace on the terms of France. A variety of cau&s;es were in ope|ration which made &s;uch an effect ab&s;olutely certain. To &s;ay nothing of the oppo&s;ition in England to the mini&s;ter, and to the war; an op|po&s;ition, which the fears of the nation would increa&s;e; to &s;ay no|thing of a war again&s;t England, which was preparing in the north; an army of one hundred and fifty thou&s;and men, under the command of Buonaparte, &s;pread upon the coa&s;t of France, and aided by all the va&s;t re&s;ources of his genius, would mo&s;t probably be enabled to invade Eng|land; in which event their government would be overturned; but &s;hould this inva&s;ion not be ab&s;olutely effected, yet the alarm it would &s;pread through the nation, the enormous expence it mu&s;t produce, would infallibly ruin them, if it was to be continued; and would drive them to &s;ave them&s;elves by a peace: That independent of this, France po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed means which would infallibly de&s;troy their bank and their
<PB N="23" REF="034817_0022_0FFF844B9D067F08">whole paper &s;y&s;tem. He &s;aid, he knew very well it was generally con|jectured that Buonaparte would leave Italy, and the army which had con|quered under him, and which adored him: He a&s;&s;ured [us that] nothing could be more unfounded than the conjecture; that Buonaparte had for more than ten days left Italy for Ra&s;tadt, to pre&s;ide over the congre&s;s, which was formed for adju&s;ting the affairs of the empire. He &s;aid, that Pitt him&s;elf was &s;o confident of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of peace, that after the naval victory over the Dutch, he had &s;ignified his readine&s;s to treat on the &s;ame terms he had offered before that action: We could not then rely on the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England. <HI>What, he a&s;ked, would be our &s;ituation, if peace &s;hould be made with England before our difference with France would be accommodated?</HI> But, he continued, if even England &s;hould be able to continue the war, and America &s;hould unite with her, it would not be in our power to injure France. We might, indeed, wound her ally; but if we did, it would be &s;o much the wor&s;e for us. After having &s;tated the dangers attending us, if we &s;hould engage in the war, he proceeded to the advantages we might derive from a neutral &s;ituation: And in&s;i&s;ted, at large, on the wealth which would naturally flow into our country from the de&s;truction of England. He next proceeded to detail the propo&s;itions which are in &s;ub&s;tance in the paper annexed, marked (A.) except, that he in&s;i&s;ted, that we &s;hould engage to u&s;e our influence with our government for the loan. He &s;tated, expre&s;&s;ly, that the propo|&s;itions were to be con&s;idered as made by us; that M. Talleyrand would not be re&s;pon&s;ible for the &s;ucce&s;s of any one of them; he would only undertake to u&s;e his influence with the Directory in &s;upport of them. The propo&s;ition, he &s;aid, concerning a <HI>suspension of hostilities</HI> on the part of France, was one which proceeded entirely from him&s;elf; M. Talley|rand had not been con&s;ulted upon it; and he could not undertake to &s;ay that that gentleman would con&s;ent even to lay it before the Directory. The propo&s;ition for an advance to the government of France, of as much money as was due from it to our citizens on contract, and as might be determined to be due for ve&s;&s;els improperly captured and con|demned, was, he &s;aid, indi&s;pen&s;ible: unle&s;s we made that, it was un|nece&s;&s;ary to make any other; for the others would not be received. He expatiated on the va&s;t advantages we &s;hould derive from delay; it was, he &s;aid, ab&s;olutely to gain our cau&s;e. He returned to the danger of our &s;ituation, and the policy of making with France any accommodation which France would a&s;&s;ent to. <HI>Perhaps, said he, you believe, that in re|turning and exposing to your countrymen the unreasonableness of the demands of this government, you will unite them in their resitance to those demands: You are mistaken: You ought to know that the diplomatic skill of France, and the means she possesses in your country, are sufficient to enable her,</HI> WITH THE FRENCH PARTY; IN AMERICA, <HI>to throw the blame, which will attend the rupture of the negociations! on the Federalists, as you term your|selves, but on the British party, as France terms you: and you may assure yourselves this will be done.</HI> He concluded with declarations of being perfectly di&s;intere&s;ted; and declared, that his only motives for &s;peaking thus freely, were his friend&s;hip for M.

<PB N="24" REF="034817_0023_0FFF844D348052A8">the intere&s;ts and peace of the United States. We told him, that the freedom with which he had &s;poken, and which was agreeable to us, would induce us to &s;peak freely al&s;o; and for once to accompany our view of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, with a retro&s;pect of the pa&s;t: <HI>that America was the only nation upon earth, which felt, and had exhibited a real friend&s;hip for the Republic of France:</HI> that among the empires round her, which were compelled to bend beneath her power, and to obey her commands, there was not one which had voluntarily acknowledged her government, or manife&s;ted for it, &s;pontaneou&s;ly, any mark of re|gard: America, alone, had &s;tepped forward, and given the mo&s;t une|quivocal proofs of a pure and &s;incere friend&s;hip, at a time when almo&s;t the whole European world, when Au&s;tria, Germany, Pru&s;&s;ia, Ru&s;&s;ia, Spain, Sardinia, Holland, and Britain, were leagued again&s;t France: when her &s;ituation was, in truth, hazardous, and it was dangerous to hold even friendly intercour&s;e with her, America alone &s;tood forward, and openly, and boldly avowed her enthu&s;ia&s;m in favor of the Republic, and her deep and &s;incere intere&s;t in its fate.&mdash;From that time to the pre|&s;ent, the government and people of the United States have uniformly manife&s;ted a &s;incere and ardent friend&s;hip for France, and have, as they conceive, in no &s;ingle in&s;tance, given to this Republic ju&s;t cau&s;e of umbrage: <HI>if they have done so they wi&s;h it to be pointed out to them,</HI> After the determination of France to break off all regular intercour&s;e with them, they have &s;ent three envoys extraordinary, to endeavor to make &s;uch explanations, as might produce reconciliation: the&s;e envoys are prepared to inve&s;tigate, and wi&s;h to inve&s;tigate any mea&s;ures which may have given offence; and are per&s;uaded that they can entirely ju&s;tify the conduct of their government. To this di&s;tant, unoffending, friendly republic, what is the conduct and the language of France? <HI>Wherever our property can be found, &s;he seizes and takes it from us; unprovoked &s;he de|termines to treat us as enemies, and our making no re&s;i&s;tance produces no dimi|nution of hostility against us; &s;he abuses and insults our government, endea|vors to weaken it in the estimation of the people, recals her own minister, re|fuses to receive ours, and when extraordinary means are taken to make such explanations, as may do away misunderstandings, and such alterations in the existing relations of the two countries, as may be mutually satisfactory, and may tend to produce harmony, the envoys who bear these powers are not receiv|ed; they are not permitted to utter the amicable wi&s;hes of their country; but in the haughty stile of</HI> a MASTER, <HI>they are told, that unless they will pay a sum, to which their resources scarcely extend, that they may expect the ven|geance of France, and like Venice be erased from the list of nations; that France will annihilate the only free republic upon earth, and the only nation in the universe, which has voluntarily manifested for her a cordial and real friend&s;hip!</HI> What impre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t this make on the mind of America, if without provocation France was determined to make war upon us, unle&s;s we purcha&s;ed peace? We could not ea&s;ily believe, that even our <HI>money</HI> would &s;ave us; our <HI>independence</HI> would never cea&s;e to give offence, and would always furni&s;h a pretext for <HI>fre&s;h demands.</HI> On the advanta|ges of neutrality, it was unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing: all the efforts of
<PB N="25" REF="034817_0024_0FFF840E4E0E1560">our government were exerted to maintain it; and we would never wil|lingly part with it. With re&s;pect to a political connexion with Britain, we told him, that America had never contemplated it. Whether the dan|ger he repre&s;ented that government to be in, was, or was not, real, we &s;hould not undertake to decide: Britain, we believed, had much rea&s;on to wi&s;h for peace; and France had much rea&s;on to wi&s;h for peace al&s;o: if peace already exi&s;ted, it would not change the cour&s;e America would pur&s;ue. M. Y. manife&s;ted the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive impatience: he interrupt|ed us, and &s;aid, this eloquent di&s;&s;ertation might be true: <HI>America might have manifested, and he believed had manifested, great friend&s;hip for France, and had just complaints against her; but he did not come to listen to those com|plaints</HI> The mini&s;ter would, on our reque&s;t, make for us certain pro|po&s;itions to the Directory: he had &s;tated them to us: and all the an|&s;wer he wi&s;hed was, yes or no: did we, or did we not, &s;olicit the mi|ni&s;ter to make the propo&s;itions for us? We told him, that without go|ing further into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, we cho&s;e to remark one or two things: they were, that the exi&s;ting treaties gave to France certain advantages, which were very e&s;&s;ential; that e&s;pecially the American coa&s;t afforded a protection, near two thou&s;and miles in extent, to the prizes made by France on her enemies, and refu&s;ed that protection to the prizes taken from her: that &s;he might be a&s;&s;ured, that in ca&s;e of war, the&s;e advan|tages would be lo&s;t forever. We al&s;o told him, we were convinced, that France mi&s;calculated on the parties in America: <HI>that the extreme inju&s;tice offered to our country, would unite every man against her.</HI> M. X. informed us, that M. Talleyrand would not con&s;ent even to lay this propo&s;ition before the Directory, without previou&s;ly receiving the <HI>fifty thousand pounds,</HI> or the greater part of it. M. Y. left, in writing, his propo&s;i|tions, and e wreturned the an&s;wer annexed, and marked (B.)</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 1&s;t.</P>
<P>It was, at length, agreed, that we would hold no more indirect inter|cour&s;e with the government.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 3d.</P>
<P>M. X. called on us, and told General Pinckney and General Mar|&s;hall (Mr. Gerry not being within) that M. Y. wi&s;hed once more to &s;ee us. We an&s;wered, that we &s;hould at any time, be glad to &s;ee M. Y. as a private gentleman: But that if his object was only to repeat his pro|po&s;itions for money, it was perfectly unnece&s;&s;ary to do &s;o; becau&s;e on that &s;ubject it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to change the an&s;wer we had already given. We told him further, that we con&s;idered it as degrading our country to carry on further &s;uch an indirect intercour&s;e, as we had for &s;ome time &s;ubmitted to, and had determined to receive no propo&s;ition, unle&s;s the per&s;ons who bore them had acknowledged authority to treat with us. He &s;aid that perhaps M. Y. might have written powers from the mini&s;ter; and we replied, that if he had, we &s;hould receive his communications with plea&s;ure. He &s;poke of a probable peace with England, and, having reque&s;ted us to be at home in the afternoon, le&s;t us.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="034817_0025_0FFF84477A8E4BA0">
About three o'clock he came, and after &s;ome conver&s;ation, in which we repeated in &s;ub&s;tance what is &s;tated above, he &s;hewed us a paper, which he &s;aid, was a copy of a letter prepared for us, by M. Talleyrand, reque&s;ting an explanation of part of the Pre&s;ident's &s;peech, and which he &s;aid would he &s;ent, unle&s;s we came into the propo&s;itions which had been made us. We wi&s;hed to take a copy of it, which he declined permitting, &s;aying, he was forbidden to allow it. We &s;poke of the letter coming to us as a mea&s;ure we had no expectation of preventing; and he &s;aid he could not under&s;tand that we wi&s;hed it delayed. To which we an&s;wered, that the delay of a few days, could not be de&s;ired, unle&s;s a hope exi&s;ted that the Directory might become more friendly to our country. <HI>He said, that intelligence had been received from the United States, that if Colonel Burr, and Mr. Madison, had con&s;tituted the mission, the differences between the two nations would have been accommodated before this time.</HI> He added, as a fact, he was not in&s;tructed to communicate, that M. Talleyrand was preparing a memorial to be &s;ent out to the United States, <HI>complaining of us, as being unfriendly to as accommodation with France.</HI> We replied to this intelligence from the United States, that the Mini&s;ter's corre&s;pondence, in America, took a good deal on them|&s;elves, when they undertook to &s;ay how the Directory would have received Colonel Burr and Mr. Madi&s;on; and that with re&s;pect to the memorial of M. Talleyrand, it would not be ea&s;y for him to convince our countrymen, that the &s;tatements, we &s;hould make, were untrue; if, however, we were confident that our conduct would be condemned, M. Talleyrand might be a&s;&s;ured, that the fear of cen&s;ure <HI>would not in|duce us to deserve it:</HI> But that we &s;hould act in a manner which our own judgments and con&s;ciencies would approve of, and we tru&s;ted, we &s;hould be &s;upported by the great body of candid and hone&s;t men. In this con|ver&s;ation we again &s;tated, that America had taken a neutral po&s;ition; that &s;he had faithfully &s;ought to pre&s;erve it; that a loan of money, to one of the belligerent powers, was directly to take part in the war; and that to take part in the war, again&s;t her own judgment and will, under the coercion of France, <HI>was to &s;urrender our independence.</HI></P>

<P N="1">I. The American Envoys &s;hall remain here for &s;ix months, in the &s;ame manner and upon the &s;ame footing, with regard to etiquette, as did M. d'Aranjo, the envoy of Portugal.</P>
<P N="2">II. There &s;hall be named a commi&s;&s;ion of five members, agreeably to a form to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, for the purpo&s;e of deciding upon the reclama|tions of the Americans, relative to the prizes made on them by the French privateers.</P>
<P N="3">III. The American envoys will engage, that their government &s;hall pay
<PB N="27" REF="034817_0026_0FFF8450F7739268">the indemnifications, or the amount of the &s;ums already decreed, to the American creditors of the French republic, and tho&s;e which &s;hall be adjudged to the claimants, by the commi&s;&s;ioners.

<P N="4">IV. One of the American envoys &s;hall return to America, to demand of his government the nece&s;&s;ary powers to purcha&s;e, for ca&s;h, the thirty-two millions of Dutch re&s;criptions, belonging to the French republic, in ca&s;e the envoys &s;hould conclude a treaty, which &s;hall be approved by the two nations.</P>
<P N="5">V. In the interval, the definitive treaty &s;hall proceed for the termination of all differences exi&s;ting between the French republic and the United States, &s;o as that the treaty may be concluded immediately on the return of the deputy.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The que&s;tion of the r&ocirc;le d'&eacute;quipage &s;hall remain &s;u&s;pended until the return of the deputy, and the commi&s;&s;ion &s;hall not pronounce upon any reclamation where this point &s;hall be in que&s;tion</P>

<HEAD><HI>EXHIBIT B.</HI> [Received with the Envoys' Letter, No. <HI>II,</HI> dated <HI>8th</HI> November, <HI>1797.</HI>]</HEAD>
<P>The envoys extraordinary and mini&s;ters plenipotentiary of the United States, cannot avoid ob&s;erving the very unu&s;ual &s;ituation in which they are placed, by the manner in which they are alone permitted to make com|munications on the objects of their mi&s;&s;ion: They are called upon to pledge their country, to a very great amount, to an&s;wer demands which appear to them as extraordinary, as they were unexpected, without be|ing permitted to di&s;cu&s;s the rea&s;on, the ju&s;tice, or the policy on which tho&s;e demands are founded, and not only without a&s;&s;urances that the rights of the United States, will in future be re&s;pected; but without a document to prove that tho&s;e to whom they are required to open them|&s;elves without re&s;erve, and at who&s;e in&s;tance they are called on to &s;a|crifice &s;o much, are empowered, even by the mini&s;ter, to hold any com|munication with them: Yet &s;uch is the anxious and real &s;olicitude of the envoys, to &s;eize any occa&s;ion which may afford a hope, however di&s;|tant, of coming to tho&s;e explanations, which they &s;o much wi&s;h to make
<PB N="28" REF="034817_0027_0FFF845678A217B8">with this republic, that they pa&s;s over the uncommon and informal modes which have been adopted, and will only con&s;ider the propo&s;itions them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="1">I. The mini&s;ters of the United States, will permit no per&s;onal con&s;ide|rations to influence their negociations with the French republic. Altho' they expected that the extraordinary means adopted by their government to reconcile it&s;elf to that of France, would have been received with &s;ome degree of attention, yet they are too &s;olicitous to enter upon the impor|tant and intere&s;ting duty of their mi&s;&s;ion, to permit them&s;elves to be re&s;trained by forms, or etiquette.</P>
<P N="2">II. On this article, it is believed, there can be no di&s;agreement.</P>
<P N="3">III. This article, as explained, would oblige the United States to advance, not to their own citizens, but to the government of France, &s;ums equi|valent to the depredations made by the cor&s;airs of the Republic, on the American commerce, and to the contracts made with their citi|zens, by France; and this advance, in&s;tead of benefiting the citizens of the United States, would leave them preci&s;ely, what they now are, the creditors of the French republic: The more exten&s;ive the depredations, and the more con&s;iderable the contracts uncomplied with, the more would the government of France receive from the United States. Inde|pendent of the&s;e objections, the mini&s;ters of the United States cannot engage to a&s;&s;ume, in any form, the debts due from France to their fel|low-citizens: they have no &s;uch power.</P>
<P N="4">IV. If the negociations be opened, and the propo&s;itions for a loan, or any other propo&s;itions, exceeding the powers of the mini&s;ters, be made, the government of the United States will be con&s;ulted thereon with ex|pedition.</P>
<P N="5">V. This, or any propo&s;ition having for its object the claims of the two nations on each other, or an accommodation of differences, will be em|braced with ardour by the mini&s;ters of the United States.</P>
<P N="6">VI. It cannot e&s;cape notice, that the que&s;tion of the r&ocirc;le d'&eacute;quipage may involve in it every ve&s;&s;el taken from the United States: the mini&s;ters however con&s;ider it, and wi&s;h to take it up as a &s;ubject of negociation.</P>
<P N="7">VII. On this article, it is only to be ob&s;erved, that the &s;ea&s;on of the year is &s;uch, as probably to render a return, within &s;ix months, of the envoy, who might &s;ail to the United States, impracticable: provi&s;ion &s;hould be on the rela|tive made for &s;uch an event.</P>
<P>If the difficulties attending the propo&s;itions for a loan, and a compen|&s;ation for pa&s;t injuries, be &s;uch as to require time for their removal, the
<PB N="29" REF="034817_0028_0FFF84594A0064F0">mini&s;ters of the United States propo&s;e, that the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions on the rela|tive &s;ituation of the two countries, may commence in the u&s;ual forms: that the relation to each other may be &s;o regulated, as to obviate fu|ture mi&s;under&s;tandings! and that the adju&s;tment of the claims of the ci|tizens of the United States, who&s;e ve&s;&s;els have been captured, may be made after a deci&s;ion on the point fir&s;t mentioned.</P>
<P>No diplomatic gratification can precede the ratification of the treaty.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>On the 11th in&s;tant we tran&s;mitted the following official letter to the mini&s;ter of foreign affairs:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>CITIZEN MINISTER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"The under&s;igned Envoys Extraordinary, and Mini&s;ters Plenipoten|tiary of the United States of America to the French Republic, had the honor of announcing to you, officially, on the &s;ixth of October, their arrival at Paris, and of pre&s;enting to you, on the 8th, a copy of their letters of credence. Your declaration, at that time, that a report on A|merican affairs, was then preparing, and would, in a few days, be laid before the Directory, who&s;e deci&s;ion thereon &s;hould, without delay, be made known, has hitherto impo&s;ed &s;ilence on them. For this commu|nication they have waited with that anxious &s;olicitude, which &s;o inter|e&s;ting an event could not fail to excite, and with that re&s;pect which is due to the government of France. They have not yet received it, and &s;o much time has been permitted to elap&s;e, &s;o critical is the &s;ituation of many of their countrymen, and &s;o embarra&s;&s;ing is that of the under&s;ign|ed, both as it re&s;pects them&s;elves and the government they repre&s;ent, that they can no longer di&s;pen&s;e with the duty of &s;oliciting your atten|tion to their mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"The United States, Citizen Mini&s;ter, at an epoch, which evinced their &s;incerity, have given inconte&s;tible proofs of their ardent friend|&s;hip, of their affection for the French Republic: the&s;e were the re|&s;ult, not of her unparalleled prowe&s;s and power, but of <HI>their confidence in her ju&s;tice and magnanimity;</HI> and in &s;uch high e&s;timation was the <HI>recipro|city</HI> of her friend&s;hip held by them, as to have been a primary object of national concern. The pre&s;ervation of it was dear to them, the lo&s;s of it a &s;ubject of unfeigned regret, and the recovery of it, by every mea|&s;ure, which &s;hall con&s;i&s;t with the rights of an independent nation, en|gages their con&s;tant attention. The government of the United States, we are authorized to declare, has examined, with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous ju&s;tice, its conduct towards its former friend. It has been led to this by a &s;incere de&s;ire to remove, of it&s;elf, every ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint; conceiving that, with the mo&s;t upright intentions, &s;uch cau&s;e may pro|bably exi&s;t; and although the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch has produced no &s;elf re|proach, although the government is con&s;cious, that it has uniformly &s;ought to pre&s;erve, with fidelity, its engagements to France, yet far
<PB N="30" REF="034817_0029_0FFF845FE8C67DE8">from wi&s;hing to exerci&s;e the privilege of judging for it&s;elf, on its own cour&s;e of rea&s;oning, and the lights in its own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, <HI>it invites fair and candid discu&s;&s;ion; it solicits a recon&s;ideration of the pa&s;t; it is persuaded, its intentions, its views, and its actions mu&s;t have been misrepresented and misunder&s;tood;</HI> it is convinced, that the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of both nations will be promoted by reconciliation and peace, and it cheri&s;hes the hope of meeting with &s;imilar di&s;po&s;itions on the part of the Directory.</P>
<P>"Guided by the&s;e &s;entiments, the Pre&s;ident of the United States has given it in charge to the under&s;igned, to &s;tate to the Executive Directory, the deep regret which he feels at the lo&s;s, or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, of the harmony and friendly intercour&s;e, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two republics, and his &s;incere wi&s;h to re&s;tore them; to di&s;cu&s;s candidly the complaints of France, and to offer frankly tho&s;e of the United States; <HI>and he has authorized a review of exi&s;ting treaties, and such alterations thereof, as &s;hall con&s;i&s;t with the mutual intere&s;t and satisfaction of the contracting parties.</HI></P>
<P>"This ta&s;k, the under&s;igned are anxious to commence; and truly happy will they be, if their exertions can, in any degree, contribute to re&s;tore that friend&s;hip, that mutual interchange of good offices, which it is alike their wi&s;h, and their duty to effect between the citizens of the two republics.</P>
<P>"The under&s;igned pray you, Citizen Mini&s;ter, to pre&s;ent this com|munication to the Executive Directory, and to receive the a&s;&s;urances of their mo&s;t perfect con&s;ideration.</P>

<P>No an&s;wer having been given to it on the 21&s;t in&s;tant; we reque&s;ted Major Rutledge to wait on the mini&s;ter, and enquire of him, whether he had communicated the letter to the Directory, and whether we might expect an an&s;wer: he replied, that he had &s;ubmitted our letter to them, and that they would direct him what &s;teps to pur&s;ue, of which we &s;hould be informed. We have not, however, hitherto received any official inti|mation relative to this bu&s;ine&s;s: we are not yet received; and the con|demnation of our ve&s;&s;els, for the want of a role d'equipage is unremit|tingly continued. <HI>Frequent and urgent attempts have been made to inveigle us again into negociation with persons not officially authorized, of which the obtaining of</HI> MONEY <HI>is the ba&s;is;</HI> but we have per&s;i&s;ted in declining to have any further communication, relative to diplomatic bu&s;ine&s;s, with per|&s;ons of that de&s;cription; and we mean to adhere to this determination.

<P>On the 14th of December, M. X. called on me, in order, as he &s;aid, to gain &s;ome information, relative to &s;ome lands in ... purcha|&s;ed by ..... for whom .... Soon afterwards Gen. Mar&s;hall came in, and then Mr. Gerry's carriage drove into the yard. Here's Mr. Gerry, &s;aid General Mar&s;hall. I am glad of it &s;aid M. X. for I wi&s;hed to meet all of you, gentlemen, to inform you that M. Y. had another me&s;&s;age to you from M. Talleyrand. I immediately ex|pre&s;&s;ed my &s;urpri&s;e at it, as M. Talleyrand, M. Y. and he, all knew our determination to have no farther communication on the &s;ubject of our mi&s;&s;ion, with per&s;ons not officially authorized. He replied, <HI>that de|termination was made &s;ix weeks ago; it was presumed that we had changed our opinion.</HI> I &s;aid that I had not; and I did not believe my colleagues had. At that moment Mr. Gerry entered the room, and I privately ac|quainted him with the object of M. X.'s vi&s;it. General Mar&s;hall, Mr. Gerry, and my&s;elf, then withdrew into another room; and immediate|ly agreed to adhere to our former re&s;olution. M. X. was then called in: when I acquainted him, in a few words, with our determination; <HI>and Mr. Gerry expatiated, more at large, on the propriety of our acting in
<PB N="32" REF="034817_0031_0FFF845367259F28">this manner, and on the very unprecedented way in which we had been treated, &s;ince our arrival.</HI></P>
<P>On the twentieth of December, a lady, who is well acquainted with M. Talleyrand, expre&s;&s;ed to me her concern, that we were &s;till in &s;o un|&s;ettled a &s;ituation: but, adds &s;he, why will not you lend us money? If you would make us a loan, all matters would be adju&s;ted; and, &s;he added, when you were contending for your revolution, we lent you money. I mentioned the very great difference there was between the &s;ituation of the two countries, at that period, and the pre&s;ent; and the very differ|ent circum&s;tances under which the loan was made us, and the loan that was now <HI>demanded</HI> from us. She replied, we do not <HI>make a demand;</HI> we think it more delicate that <HI>the offer &s;hould come from you:</HI> but M. Talleyrand has mentioned to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> (who and &s;urely not in his confidence) the nece&s;&s;ity of your making a loan: And I know that he has mentioned it to two or three others; and that you have been informed of it: and I will a&s;&s;ure you, that if you remain here &s;ix months longer you would not advance a &s;ingle &s;top further in your negociations, without a loan. If that is the ca&s;e, I replied, we may as well go away now. Why, that po&s;&s;ibly, &s;aid &s;he, might lead to a rupture, which you had better avoid: <HI>for we know we have a very con&s;iderable party in America who are &s;trongly in our intere&s;t.</HI>&mdash;There is no occa&s;ion to enter into a further detail of the con|ver&s;ation. I have only noted this part of it, as expre&s;&s;ive of what I be|lieve (as far as it relates to the loan and party in America, in their favor) to be the &s;entiments of the French government with regard to us.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Extract from General Mar&s;hall's Journal.</HEAD>
<P>December 17th, 1797. I &s;tepped into Mr. Gerry's appartment, where I &s;aw M. Y. He expre&s;&s;ed his regret at having been di&s;abled to dine with us at M. de Beaumarchais, by an inveterate tooth ache. He then a&s;ked me whether I had &s;een M. Beaumarchais lately? I told him, not &s;ince he dined with us; and that he had left us, much indi&s;po&s;ed. He then ob&s;erved, that he had not known, until lately, that I was the advo|cate for that gentleman in his cau&s;e again&s;t the &s;tate of Virginia; and that M. de Beaumarchais, in con&s;equence of that circum&s;tance, ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;entiments of a very high regard for me, I replied, that M. de Beaumarchais' cau&s;e was of great magnitude, very uncer|tain i&s;&s;ue.&mdash;and con&s;equently that a portion of the intere&s;t be felt in it would, very naturally, be transferred to his advocate. He immedi|ately &s;aid (low and apart) that M. de Beaumarchais had con&s;ented, pro|vided his claim could be e&s;tabli&s;hed, to &s;acrifice fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling of it, as the private gratification which had been required of us: &s;o that the gratification might be made without any actual lo&s;s to the
<PB N="33" REF="034817_0032_0FFF8412CCA814F0">American government. I an&s;wered, that a gratification, on any terms, or in any form, was a &s;ubject which we approached with much fear and difficulty, as we were not authorized by our government to make one; nor had it been expected that one would be nece&s;&s;ary; that I could not undertake to &s;ay whether my colleagues would con&s;ent to it, in any &s;tate of things; but I could undertake to &s;ay, no one of us would con|&s;ent to it, unle&s;s it was preceded, or accompanied, by a full and entire recognition of the claims of our citizens, and a &s;atisfactory arrangement on the objects of our mi&s;&s;ion. He &s;aid, it was in the expectation of that event only that he mentioned it. We parted: and I &s;tated the con|ver&s;ation to General Pinckney, who was di&s;inclined to any &s;tipulation of the &s;ort, and con&s;idered it as a renewal of the old reprobated &s;y&s;tem of indirect, unauthori&s;ed negociation.</P>
<P>Having been originally the coun&s;el of M. de Beaumarchais, I had determined, and &s;o I informed General Pinckney, that I would not, by my voice, e&s;tabli&s;h any agreement in his favour; but that I would po&s;itively oppo&s;e any admi&s;&s;ion of the claim of any French citizen, if not accompanied with the admi&s;&s;ion of the claims of the American citizens of property, captured and condemned for want of a role d'equi|page. My rea&s;on for conceiving that this ought to be &s;tipulated ex|pre&s;&s;ly, was a conviction, that if it was referred to commi&s;&s;ioners, it would be committing, ab&s;olutely to chance, as complete a right as any individuals ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. General Pinckney was again&s;t admitting the claim at any rate.</P>
<P>After my return, Mr. Gerry came into my room, and told me, that M. Y. had called on him, to accompany him on a vi&s;it to M. Talleyrand; that he propo&s;ed &s;eeing M. Talleyrand, and returning the civility of the dinner; and endeavouring to bring about &s;ome intercour&s;e between him and us.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 18. General Pinckney, and Mr. Gerry, met in my room; and Mr. Gerry detailed to us the conver&s;ations mentioned in our public letter. The propo&s;ition relative to the claim of M. de Beaumarchais is entirely different from my under&s;tanding of it, in the very brief &s;tate|ment made to me by M. Y. We re&s;olved, that we would rigidly adhere to the rule we had adopted, to enter into no negociation with per&s;ons not formally authorized to treat with us.&mdash;We came al&s;o to the deter|mination to prepare a letter to the Mini&s;ter of Foreign Relations, &s;lating the object of our mi&s;&s;ion, and di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the &s;ubjects of difference between the two nations, in like manner as if we had been actually received; and to clo&s;e the letter, with reque&s;ting the government to open the negociation with us, or grant to us our pa&s;&s;ports.</P>

<P><HI>December</HI> 13. <HI>Mr. Gerry accidentally calling on General Pinckney, found M X. and was &s;oon informed, that his object was to obtain another inter|view between the mini&s;ters and M. Y. on the affairs of their mi&s;&s;ion. General
<PB N="34" REF="034817_0033_0FFF84617166FCE8">Mar&s;hall happening al&s;o to be there, we retired into another room, and im|mediately agreed to adhere to our former determination, not to have any more informal communications. M. X. having been called in, General Pinckney briefly communicated our determination: and Mr. Gerry ob&s;erved, that he was much hurt by this propo&s;ition; that the Mini&s;ters had already proceeded farther, in this mode of communication, than perhaps they could ju&s;tify; that they had refu&s;ed &s;ix weeks ago, to renew it; and that &s;ome regard ought to be paid to their feelings, which had been &s;ufficiently mortified; that the propo&s;ition was di&s;re&s;pectful to the Envoys, as it betrayed a belief that they had lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of their dignity, and were indeed incompetent to their effice; that had there been but one Envoy extraordinary, be ought to have had an audience in a few days; and that for three, to remain between two and three months in this &s;ituation, was too humiliating, too deba&s;ing for any nation to &s;ubmit to it; that for his own part, had he been &s;ent to any other nation in Europe, with two other Envoys, he would not have con&s;ented to have remained in &s;uch a &s;tate ten days; that knowing the great de&s;ire of the government and nation of the United States to be at peace with France, he had, with his colleagues, &s;ub|mitted to this indignity, at the ri&s;que of the &s;evere cen&s;ure of the former.&mdash;Having al&s;o enquired of M. X. at what time M. Talleyrand could be &s;een, the former &s;aid he would enquire of M. Y. who on the</HI> 16th <HI>in the evening, &s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. Gerry's ab&s;ence from his lodgings, a billet, as follows; "M. Y. has the honour to pre&s;ent his re&s;pects to Mr. Gerry, and to inform him, that he will have the honour to wait on him to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock, to go together to the Mini&s;ter of Foreign Relations, he is with re&s;pect," &amp;c. On the morning of the</HI> 17th, <HI>M. Y. came in, while Mr. Gerry was at break|fa&s;t, not having received an an&s;wer to his note: and Mr. Mar&s;hall coming in, M. Y. took him a&s;ide and conferred with him a con&s;iderable time; after which the former, and the re&s;t of the family, left the room, and M. Y. and Mr. Gerry being together, Mr. Gerry told him, that his object in &s;eeing M. Talleyrand was to return a civility, by reque&s;ting him to fix a day for di|ning with Mr. G. who intended to invite his colleagues; by this interview to promote, if po&s;&s;ible, a better under&s;tanding between the Mini&s;ter and the American Envoys; and Mr G. al&s;o propo&s;ed to confer with the mini&s;ter on the di&s;agreeable &s;ituation the Envoys were in, and to &s;tate to him &s;ome re|ports which appeared to be founded, re&s;pecting a propo&s;ition before the Di|rectory, for &s;ending off all Americans in a &s;hort period; but Mr. Gerry ad|ded, that he could not hear a word on the &s;ubject of the mi&s;&s;ion, or the pre|liminaries to a negociation; as the Envoys had determined, unanimou&s;ly, a|gain&s;t any informal communications on the &s;ubject. M. Y. in an&s;wer, &s;aid, that Mr. Mar&s;hall had ju&s;t heard him on a &s;ubject of this kind; &amp; that we might con&s;ider it as he did, merely as a conver&s;ation between ourselves. He then &s;tated, that two mea&s;ures which M. Talleyrand propo&s;ed being adopted, a re&s;toration of friend&s;hip between the republics would follow immediately; the one was a gratuity of fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, the other a pur|cha&s;e of thirty two millions of Dutch re&s;criptions; that as to the fir&s;t, M. de Beaumarchais had recovered, in a cau&s;e, depending in Virginia, between that &s;tate and him&s;elf, one hundred and forty five thou&s;and pounds &s;tening; that there was an appeal from the judgment; that he would &s;ign an act to
<PB N="35" REF="034817_0034_0FFF84166C35F288">relinqui&s;h forty five thou&s;and pounds, if the whole &s;hould be finally recoverea, leaving only one hundred thou&s;and pounds for him&s;elf; that the</HI> &pound; 45,000 <HI>might accrue to the United States, who would, in that ca&s;e, lo&s;e but a &s;mall part of the fifty thou&s;and pounds; that the purcha&s;e of &s;ixteen millions of re|&s;criptions would amount to but one million three hundred thirty three thou|&s;and [pounds] &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence, &s;terling, which, with an inte|re&s;t of five per cent. would be certainly paid by the gavernment of Holland to the United States, and leave them without any lo&s;s; that more than half the &s;um may now he hired in Holland, on the credit of the re&s;criptions, and an ea&s;y arrangement be made for payment by &s;hort in&s;taiments, which might be obtained al&s;o by a loan; that it was worthy the attention of the Envoys to con&s;ider, whether by &s;o &s;mall a &s;acrifice they would e&s;tabli&s;h a peace with France, or whether they would ri&s;k the con&s;equences; that if nothing could be done by the Enveys, arrangements would be made forthwith to ravage the coa&s;ts of the United States, by frigates from St. Domingo; that &s;mall &s;tates, which had offended France, were &s;uffering by it; that Hamburgh, and other ci|ties in that quarter, would within a month, or two, have their governments changed; that Switzerland would undergo the &s;ame operation; and that Pon|tugal would probably be in a wor&s;e predicament; that the expedition again&s;t England would be certainly pur&s;ued; and that the pre&s;ent period was the mo&s;t favourable, if we wi&s;hed to adopt any mea&s;ure for a pacification.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Gerry, in an&s;wer, &s;aid, that if the French were di&s;po&s;ed to pur|&s;ue with vengeance the United States, they might perhaps ravage their coa&s;ts, and injure them in this way, but they never could &s;ubdue them, the mea&s;ure he thought utterly impracticable, even if attempted by France and her allies. To which M. Y. a&s;&s;ented. Mr. Gerry ob&s;erved, fur|ther, that the ravages alluded to, would undoubtedly clo&s;ely connect the United States and Great-Britain, and prevent the former from re|turning to the friend&s;hip which they have ever had for France; that as to the propo&s;itions, he &s;hould expre&s;s no opinion on them; that his &s;itu|ation, and that of his colleagues, was extremely difficult; that the Di|rectory were exclu&s;ively prejudiced again&s;t the government of the Uni|ted States, and con&s;idered them as the friends of Great Britain; that if the envoys could have an opportunity of being heard, they could re|move &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions, and &s;how that the government were the friends of France, as much as of Great-Britain; but that the envoys were now in the mo&s;t painful &s;ituation; that they were treated, in the eyes of all Europe, and of the American government and nation, with the ut|mo&s;t contempt, and were &s;ubmitting to indignities which they could not reconcile to their feelings, or ju&s;tify to their con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>M. Y. &s;aid, that the ob&s;ervations were ju&s;t: but that the American en|voys had not experienced wor&s;e treatment than other mini&s;ters, nor in|deed as bad; that the envoy of Portugal was again ordered to depart; and that but little ceremony was ob&s;erved to the envoys in general. M. Y. and Mr. Gerry, then took a ride to M. Talleyrand's bureau, who re|ceived them politely: and after being &s;eated, Mr. Gerry ob&s;erved to M. Talleyrand, in Engli&s;h, &s;lowly, that M. Y. had &s;tated to him that morning &s;ome propo&s;itions, as coming from M. Talleyrand, re&s;pecting
<PB N="36" REF="034817_0035_0FFF5D906427CC60">which Mr. Gerry could give no opinion: that his object, at this inter|view was, to reque&s;t of him information, whether he would fix a time for taking a dinner with Mr. Gerry, at which he propo&s;ed to invite his col|leagues; that he wi&s;hed for more frequent interviews of &s;ome kind or other between him&s;elf, &amp; the envoys; conceiving that many imaginary difficulties, which ob&s;tructed the negociation, would vani&s;h by this means; and that tho&s;e which were real would be &s;urmounted; that conceiving the delicate part which the mini&s;ter of France had to act; at this time, he did not wi&s;h M. Talleyrand to accept the invitation if it would &s;ubject him to inconveniences; that he wi&s;hed to &s;peak on another &s;ubject; and it was painful to him to acknowledge, that the precarious &s;ituation of the envoys was &s;uch, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible for them to take mea&s;ures for decent arrangements; that a &s;hort time &s;ince, he had &s;uppo&s;ed mea&s;ures were taking a favourable turn; but that lately he had received, from various quarters, information of a report made by the mini&s;ter of the interior, and under the con&s;ideration of the Directory, <HI>for &s;ending all Americans from Paris in twenty-four hours;</HI> that he could not be re&s;pon&s;ible for the truth of the information; but it appeared to him, as well from the various quarters from which it came, as from the intelligence of the per&s;on who gave it, to be highly probable; that if this was the ca&s;e, it was unnece&s;&s;ary for the Directory, as he conceived, to pa&s;s any arrete, as it re&s;pected the envoys, for that they would de|part from Paris whenever it was hinted, as the wi&s;h of the Directory; that for his own part he &s;hould feel more at ea&s;e, until we were re|ceived, to re&s;ide in a city of &s;ome other nation, than that of France; and to return to Paris, on notice that the Directory were di&s;po&s;ed to open the negociation.</P>
<P><HI>M. Talleyrand appeared to be very unea&s;y at this declaration;</HI> but avoided &s;aying a word on it. <HI>He &s;aid, that the information M. Y. had given me was ju&s;t, and might always be relied on;</HI> but that he would reduce to writing his propo&s;itions; which he accordingly did; and after he had &s;hewn them to Mr. Gerry, <HI>he burnt the paper.</HI> The &s;ub&s;tance was as follows.&mdash;[<HI>See No.</HI> 1, <HI>below.</HI>]</P>
<P>He then &s;aid, that he accepted of the invitation; that he would dine with him the decade after the pre&s;ent, in which he was engaged.</P>
<P>Mr. Gerry did not repeat all that he had &s;aid to M. Y. having no doubt he would communicate the whole to M. Talleyrand. And, after expre&s;&s;ing a friend&s;hip for the French republic, and a warm de&s;ire to re|new the former attachment of the two republics, which M. Talleyrand warmly reciprocated, Mr. Gerry bid M. Talley and adieu; leaving him with M. Y.</P>
<P>(No. 1.)</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>CITIZENS REPRESENTATIVES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>On this day, the fifteenth of Nivo&s;e, and at the very hour at which the Executive Directory addre&s;&s;es this me&s;&s;age to you, the municipal
<PB N="38" REF="034817_0037_0FFF846491DB8498">admini&s;trators, the ju&s;tices of the peace, the commi&s;&s;aries of the Directory, and the &s;uperintendance of the cu&s;toms, are proceeding in all the chief places of the departments, in all the ports, and in all the principal communes of the republic, to &s;eize the Engli&s;h merchandize now in France, or introduced into its territory, in contravention of the law of the tenth Brumaire, fifth year (Oct. 31&s;t, 1796.)</P>
<P>Such is the fir&s;t act by which, now that peace is given to the conti|nent, the war declared long &s;ince again&s;t England, is about to a&s;&s;ume the real character which becomes it. The French will not &s;uffer a power, which &s;eeks to found its pro&s;perity upon the misfortune of other nations, to rai&s;e its commerce upon the ruin of that of other &s;tates, and which, a&s;piring to the dominion of the &s;eas, wi&s;hes to introduce, every where, the articles of its own manufacture, and to receive nothing from foreign indu&s;try&mdash;any longer to enjoy the fruit of its guilty &s;peculations:</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h government has kept in pay, during the war, the coal|e&s;ced forces, with the produce of its manufactures. It has violated all the principles of the law of nations, in order to &s;hackle the relations of neutral powers; it has cau&s;ed to be &s;eized the provi&s;ions, corn, and commodities, which it &s;uppo&s;ed to be de&s;tined for France; it has de|clared contraband every thing which it thought could be u&s;eful to the republic; it de&s;ired to &s;tarve it. All the citizens call for vengeance.</P>
<P>When it had to fear the capture of ve&s;&s;els &s;ailing under its flag, it corrupted foreign captains to induce them to take on board their ve&s;&s;els Engli&s;h merchandize, and thus to introduce it by &s;tratagem, by fraud or otherwi&s;e, into other &s;tates, and e&s;pecially into the French Republic.</P>
<P>The neutral powers &s;hould have perceived, that, by this conduct, their merchants took part in the war, and that they lent a&s;&s;i&s;tance to one of the Belligerent powers.</P>
<P>We &s;erve a party, as well when we procure for it the means of aug|menting its forces, as when we unite our&s;elves to tho&s;e which it has. The neutral powers &s;hould have perceived, that, England, by &s;topping the ve&s;&s;els of other powers, laden in their re&s;pective ports, and de&s;tined for France, by permitting articles coming from her own manufactories alone to circulate, aimed at an exclu&s;ive commerce, and that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eck reparation for &s;uch an attempt.</P>
<P><HI>The ordinance of the marine, and the regulation of</HI> 1704, <HI>have declared lawful prize, the vessels, and their cargoes, in which is found merchandize belonging to enemies. These provisions should be extended.</HI> The intere&s;t of Europe requires it.</P>
<P>The Directory thinks it urgent, and nece&s;&s;ary, to pa&s;s a law, declaring that the character of ve&s;&s;els, relative to their quality of neutral or ene|my, &s;hall be determined by their cargo, and the cargo &s;hall be no longer covered by the flag: in con&s;equence, that every American ve&s;&s;el found at &s;ea, having on board Engli&s;h provi&s;ions and merchandize, as her cargo, in whole, or in part, &s;hall be declared lawful prize, who&s;o|ever may be the proprietor of the&s;e provi&s;ions or merchandize; which &s;hall be reputed contraband, for this cau&s;e alone, that they come from England or her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="034817_0038_0FFF846A4F7F7010">
It would be u&s;eful to declare, at the &s;ame time, that except in the ca&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s, the ports of the republic &s;hall be &s;hut to all foreign ve&s;&s;els, which, in the cour&s;e of their voyage, &s;hall have entered tho&s;e of England.</P>
<P>The Executive Directory reque&s;ts you, citizens repre&s;entatives, to adopt the&s;e mea&s;ures. No neutral or allied power can mi&s;take their object, nor complain of them, unle&s;s it be already abandoned to England. The infallible effect of the mea&s;ure is to enhance the value of the produce of their own &s;oil and indu&s;try, to increa&s;e the pro&s;perity of their com|merce, to repel every thing that comes from England, and e&s;&s;entially to influence the conclu&s;ion of the war.</P>
<P>Such are the motives which induce the Executive Directory to invite you, citizens repre&s;entatives, to take the object of this me&s;&s;age into the mo&s;t prompt con&s;ideration.</P>

<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is known to you, that the people of the United States of America, entertained a warm and &s;incere affection for the people of France, ever &s;ince their arms were united in the war with Great Britain, which ended
<PB N="40" REF="034817_0039_0FFF83FF39BCB748">in the full and formal acknowledgement of the Independence of the&s;e &s;tates. It is known to you, that this affection was ardent, when the French determined to reform their government, and e&s;tabli&s;h it on the ba&s;is of liberty; that liberty in which the people of the United States were born, and which, in the conclu&s;ion of the war, above mentioned, was fi|nally and firmly &s;ecured. It is known to you, that this affection ro&s;e to enthu&s;ia&s;m, when the war was kindled between France and the powers of Europe, which were combined again&s;t her, for the avowed purpo&s;e of re&s;toring the monarchy; and every where vows were heard for the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the French arms. Yet, during this period, France expre&s;&s;ed no wi&s;h that the United States &s;hould depart from their neutrality. And while no duty required us to enter into the war, and our be&s;t intere&s;ts ur|ged us to remain at peace, the government determined to take a neutral &s;tation: which being taken, the duties of an impartial neutrality be|came indi&s;pen&s;ably binding. Hence the government early proclaimed to our citizens the nature of tho&s;e duties, and the con&s;equences of their violation.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter of France, Mr. Genet, who arrived about this time, by his public declaration, confirmed the idea, that France did not de&s;ire us to quit the ground we had taken. His mea&s;ures, however, were cal|culated to de&s;troy our neutrality and to draw us into the war.</P>
<P>The principles of the proclamation of neutrality, founded on the law of nations, which is the law of the land, were afterwards recognized by the National Legi&s;lature, and the ob&s;ervance of them enforced by &s;pecific penalties, in the act of Congre&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed the fifth of June, 1794. By the&s;e principles, and laws, the acts of the executive, and the deci&s;ions of the courts of the United States were regulated.</P>
<P>A government thus fair and upright in its principles, and ju&s;t and im|partial in its conduct, might have confidently hoped to be &s;ecure again&s;t formal official cen&s;ure: but the United States have not been &s;o fortunate. The acts of their government, in its various branches, though pure in principle, and impartial in operation, and conformable to their indi&s;pen|&s;ible rights of &s;overeignty, have been a&s;&s;igned as the cau&s;e of the offen|&s;ive and injurious mea&s;ures of the French Republic. For proofs of the former, all the acts of the government may be vouched, while the a&s;per|&s;ions &s;o freely uttered by the French mini&s;ters, the refu&s;al to hear the mi|ni&s;ter of the United States, &s;pecially charged to enter on amicable di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions, on all the topics of complaint, the decrees of the Executive Direc|tory, and of their agents, the depredations on our commerce, and the violences again&s;t the per&s;ons of our citizens, are evidences of the latter. The&s;e injuries, and depredations, will con&s;titute an important &s;ubject of your di&s;cu&s;&s;ions with the government of the French Republic; and for all the&s;e wrongs you will &s;eek redre&s;s.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the depredations on our commerce, the principal objects will be, to agree on an equitable mode of examining and deciding the claims of our citizens, and the manner and periods of making them com|pen&s;ation. As to the fir&s;t, the &s;eventh article of the Briti&s;h, and the twenty-fir&s;t of the Spani&s;h treaty, pre&s;ent approved precedents to be a|dopted
<PB N="41" REF="034817_0040_0FFF846BD8100CA8">with France. The propo&s;ed mode of adju&s;ting tho&s;e claims, by commi&s;&s;ioners appointed on each &s;ide, is &s;o perfectly fair, we cannot ima|gine that it will be refu&s;ed. But when the claims are adju&s;ted, if pay|ment, in &s;pecie, cannot be obtained, it may be found nece&s;&s;ary to agree, in behalf of our citizens, that they &s;hall accept public &s;ecurities, payable with intere&s;t, at &s;uch periods as the &s;tate of the French finances &s;hall ren|der practicable. The&s;e periods you will endeavor, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to &s;horten.</P>
<P>Not only the recent depredations, under colour of the decrees of the Directory, of the &s;econd of July, 1796, and the &s;econd of March, 1797, or under the decrees of their agents, or the illegal &s;entences of their tri|bunals, but all prior ones, not already &s;atisfactorily adju&s;ted, &s;hould be put in this equitable train of &s;ettlement. To cancel many, or all of the la&s;t mentioned claims, might be the effect of the decree of the Executive Directory, of the &s;econd of March la&s;t, reviving the decree of the 9th of May, 1793; but this being an <HI>ex-post facto</HI> regulation, as well as a violation of the treaty between the United States and France, cannot be obligatory on the former. Indeed the greater part, probably nearly all the captures and confi&s;cations in que&s;tion, have been committed in di|rect violation of that treaty, or of the law of nations. But the injuries ari&s;ing from the capture of enemies property, in ve&s;&s;els of the United States, may not be very exten&s;ive; and if for &s;uch captured property, the French government will, agreeably to the law of nations, pay the freight and rea&s;onable demurrage, we &s;hall not, on this account, any farther con|tend. But of &s;hip timber, and naval &s;tores, taken and confi&s;cated by the French, they ought to pay the full value; becau&s;e our citizens continued their traffic, in tho&s;e articles, under the faith of the treaty with France. On the&s;e two points we ought to expect that the French government will not refu&s;e to do us ju&s;tice: and the more, becau&s;e it has not, at any period of the war, expre&s;&s;ed its de&s;ire that the commercial treaty &s;hould, in the&s;e re&s;pects, be altered.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the claims of our citizens for depredations on their property, there are many ari&s;ing from expre&s;s contracts made with the French government, or its agents, or founded on the &s;eizure of their property, in French ports. Other claims have ari&s;en from the long detention of a multitude of our ve&s;&s;els in the ports of France. The wrong hereby done to our citizens was acknowledged by the French government, and in &s;ome, perhaps in mo&s;t of the ca&s;es, &s;mall payments towards indemni|fications have been made: the re&s;idue &s;till remains to be claimed.</P>
<P>All the&s;e ju&s;t demands of our citizens will merit your attention. The be&s;t po&s;&s;ible means of compen&s;ation mu&s;t be attempted. The&s;e will depend on what you &s;hall di&s;cover to be practicable in relation to the French finances. But an exception mu&s;t be made in re&s;pect to debts due to our citizens by the contract of the French government and its agents, if they are comprehended in any &s;tipulation; and an option re&s;erved to them, jointly or individually, either to accept the means of payment
<PB N="42" REF="034817_0041_0FFF846D606C1450">which you &s;hall &s;tipulate or re&s;ort to the French government, directly for the &s;ufilment of its contracts.</P>
<P>Although the reparation for lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the citizens of the United States, in con&s;equence of irregular, or illegal captures, or con|demnations, or forcible &s;eizures, or detentions, is of very high importance, and is to be pre&s;&s;ed with the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, yet it is not to be in&s;i&s;ted on as an indi&s;pen&s;able condition of the propo&s;ed treaty. You are not, however, to renounce the&s;e claims of our citizens, nor to &s;tipulate that they be a&s;&s;umed by the United States as a loan to the French govern|ment.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the alterations of the commercial treaty with France, in the two ca&s;es which have been principal &s;ubjects of complaint on her part, viz. enemies property in neutral &s;hips, and the articles contraband of war; although France can have no right to claim the annulling of &s;tipulations at the moment when by both parties they were originally intended to operate; yet if the French government pre&s;s for alterations, the Pre&s;ident has no difficulty in &s;ub&s;tituting the principles of the law of nations, as &s;tated in the 17th and 18th articles of our commercial treaty with Great Britain, to tho&s;e of the 23d and 24th articles of our com|mercial treaty with France: and in re&s;pect to provi&s;ions, and other articles, not u&s;ually deemed contraband, you are to agree only on a tem|porary compromi&s;e, like that in the 18th article of the Briti&s;h treaty, and of the &s;ame duration. If however, in order to &s;atisfy France <HI>now &s;he is at war,</HI> we change the two important articles before mentioned, then the 14th article of the French treaty, which &s;ubjects the property of the neutral nation found on board enemies &s;hips to capture and con|demnation, mu&s;t of cour&s;e be aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>We have witne&s;&s;ed &s;o many erroneous con&s;tructions of the treaty with France, even in its plaine&s;t parts, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to examine every article critically, for the purpo&s;e of preventing, as far as human wi&s;dom can prevent, all future mi&s;interpretations. The kind of documents, nece&s;&s;ary for the protection of the neutral ve&s;&s;els, &s;hould be enumerated and minutely de&s;cribed; the ca&s;es in which a &s;ea-letter &s;hould be required may be &s;pecified; the want of a &s;ea-letter &s;hould not, of it&s;elf, be a cau&s;e of confi&s;cation, where other rea&s;onable proof of property is produced; and where &s;uch proof is furni&s;hed, the want of a &s;ea-letter &s;hould go no further than to &s;ave the captor from damages for detaining and bring|ing in the neutral ve&s;&s;el. The proportion of the ve&s;&s;el's crew, which may be foreigners, &s;hould be agreed on. Perhaps it will be expedient to introduce divers other regulations conformably to the marine laws of France. Whenever the&s;e are to operate on the commerce of the United States, our &s;afety requires, that as far as po&s;&s;ible, they be fixed by treaty. And it will be de&s;irable to &s;tipulate again&s;t any <HI>ex po&s;t facto laws,</HI> or regulation, under any pretence whatever.</P>
<P>Great Britain has often claimed a right, and practi&s;ed upon it, to prohibit neutral nations carrying on a commerce with her enemies which had not been allowed in time of peace. On this head, it will be de&s;irable
<PB N="43" REF="034817_0042_0FFF8454EFCCFBF8">to come to an explicit under&s;tanding with France; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to obviate the claim by an expre&s;s &s;tipulation.</P>
<P>Such exten&s;ive depredations have been committed on the commerce of neutrals, and e&s;pecially of the United States, by the citizens of France, under pretence that her enemies (particularly Great-Britain) have done the &s;ame things, it will be de&s;irable to have it explicitly &s;tipu|lated, that the conduct of an enemy towards the neutral power &s;hall not authorize or excu&s;e the other belligerent power in any departure from the law of nations, or the &s;tipulations of the treaty: E&s;pecially that the ve&s;&s;els of the neutral nation &s;hall never be captured or detained, or their property confi&s;cated or injured, becau&s;e bound to or from an enemy's port, except the ca&s;e of a blockaded port, the entering into which may be prevented according to the known rule of the law of nations. And it may be expedient to define a blockaded place, or port, to be one actually inve&s;ted by land or naval forces, or both, and that no <HI>declaration</HI> of a blockade &s;hall have any effect without &s;uch actual inve&s;tment. And no commercial right whatever &s;hould be abandoned which is &s;ecured to neutral powers by the European law of nations.</P>
<P>The foregoing articles being tho&s;e which the French government has made the o&s;ten&s;ible grounds of its principal compalints, they have natu|rally been fir&s;t brought into view. But the propo&s;ed alterations, and arrangements, &s;ugge&s;t the propriety of revi&s;ing all our treaties with France. In &s;uch revi&s;ion, the fir&s;t object that will attract your attention is the reciprocal guaranty in the eleventh article of the treaty of alliance. This guaranty we are perfectly willing to renounce. The guaranty by France of the liberty, &s;overeignty, and independence of the United States, will add nothing to our &s;ecurity, while, on the contrary, our guaranty of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of France in America, will perpetually ex|po&s;e us to the ri&s;que and expen&s;e of war, or to di&s;putes and que&s;tions concerning our national faith.</P>
<P>When Mr. Genet was &s;ent as the mini&s;ter of the French Republic to the United States, its &s;ituation was embarra&s;&s;ed, and the &s;ucce&s;s of its mea&s;ures problematical. In &s;uch circum&s;tances it was natural that France &s;hould turn her eye to the mutual guaranty: And accordingly it was required in Mr. Genet's in&s;tructions, to be "an e&s;&s;ential clau&s;e in the new treaty," which he was to propo&s;e: And on the ground "that it nearly concerned the peace and pro&s;perity of the French nation, that a people, who&s;e re&s;ources increa&s;e beyond all calculation, and whom nature had placed &s;o near their rich colonies, &s;hould become intere&s;ted, by their own engagements, in the pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e i&s;lands." But at this time, France, powerful by her victories, and &s;ecure in her triumphs, may le&s;s regard the reciprocal guaranty with the United States, and be willing to relinqui&s;h it. As a &s;ub&s;titute for the reciprocal guaranty may be pro|po&s;ed a mutual renunciation of the &s;ame territories and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that were &s;ubjects of the guaranty and renunciation in the &s;ixth and eleventh articles of the treaty of alliance. Such a renunciation, on our part, would obviate the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned in the in&s;truction to Mr. Genet before cited,
<PB N="44" REF="034817_0043_0FFF846EE78BC780"><HI>of future danger from the rapidly growing power of the United States.</HI> But if France in&s;i&s;ts on the mutual guaranty, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to aim at &s;ome modification of it.</P>
<P>The exi&s;ting engagement is of that kind, which, by writers on the law of nations, is called a general guaranty; of cour&s;e the <HI>ca&s;us foederis</HI> can never occur except in a <HI>defen&s;ive war.</HI> The nature of this obligation is under&s;tood to be, that when a war <HI>really</HI> and <HI>truly defen&s;ive</HI> exi&s;ts, the engaging nation is bound to furni&s;h an <HI>effectual</HI> and adequate <HI>defence</HI> in co-operation with the power attacked: whence it follows that the nation <HI>may</HI> be required, in &s;ome circum&s;tances to bring forward its whole force. The nature and extent of the &s;uccours demandable, not being a&s;certained, engagements of this kind are dangerous on account of their uncertainty: there is always hazard of doing too much, or too little, and of cour&s;e of being involved in involuntary rupture.</P>
<P>Specific &s;uccours have the advantage of certainty, and are le&s;s liable to occa&s;ion war. On the other hand, a general guaranty allows a latitude for the exerci&s;e of judgement and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>On the part of the United States, in&s;tead of troops or &s;hips of war, it will be convenient to &s;tipulate for a moderate &s;um of money; or quantity of provi&s;ions, at the option of France; the provi&s;ions to be delivered at our own ports, in any future <HI>defen&s;ive</HI> wars. The &s;um of money, or its value in provi&s;ions, ought not to exceed two hundred thou&s;and dollars a year, during any &s;uch wars. The reciprocal &s;tipulations, on the part of France, may be to furni&s;h annually the like &s;um of money, or any equivalent in military &s;tores and cloathing for troops, at the option of the United States to be delivered in the ports of France.</P>
<P>Particular caution, however, mu&s;t be u&s;ed in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this &s;ubject, not to admit any claims on the ground of the guaranty in relation to the exi&s;ting war; as we do not allow that the <HI>cases foederis</HI> applies to it. And if the war &s;hould continue after your arrival in France, and the que&s;tion of the guaranty &s;hould not be mentioned on her part, you may your&s;elves be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, if you deem it mo&s;t prudent.</P>
<P>It will be proper here to notice &s;uch articles of the treaty of amity and commerce between the United States and France as have been dif|ferently con&s;trued by the two governments, or which it may be expedi|ent to amend or explain.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 2. The a&s;&s;ent of the United States, in their treaty with Great Britain, to the doctrine of the law of nations, re&s;pecting enemies proper|ty in neutral &s;hips and &s;hip timber, and naval &s;tores, and in &s;ome ca&s;es provi&s;ions, as contraband of war; the French government has cho&s;en to con&s;ider as a voluntary <HI>grant of favours,</HI> in re&s;pect to commerce and navi|gation, to Great Britain, and that con&s;equently the &s;ame favours have become common to France. This con&s;truction is &s;o foreign from our ideas of the meaning and de&s;ign of this article, it &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity of reviewing all the articles, and however clear they may appear, of at|tempting to obviate future mi&s;con&s;tructions by declaratory explanations or a change of terms.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 5. France has repeatedly contended, that the impo&s;ition of
<PB N="45" REF="034817_0044_0FFF847211DCD488">fifty per cent. per ton, on French ve&s;&s;els arriving in the United States, is contrary to the fifth article of the treaty. The arguments in &s;upport of this preten&s;ion are unknown; but it is pre&s;umed to be unfounded. The reciprocal right of laying "duties or impo&s;ts of what nature &s;oever," equal to tho&s;e impo&s;ed on the mo&s;t favored nations, and without any other re&s;trictions, &s;eems to be clearly &s;ettled by the third and fourth articles. The fifth article appears to have been intended merely to define or qualify the rights of American ve&s;&s;els in France. It is however de&s;irable that the que&s;tion be under&s;tood, and all doubt concerning it removed. But the in|troduction of a principle of di&s;crimination between the ve&s;&s;els of differ|ent foreign nations, and in derogation of the powers of Congre&s;s, to rai&s;e revenue by uniform duties on any objects whatever, cannot be ha|zarded. The naturalization of French ve&s;&s;els will of cour&s;e be con&s;ider|ed as inadmi&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 8. The &s;tipulation of doing us good offices, to &s;ecure peace to the United States with the Barbary powers, has never yet procured us any advantage. If therefore the French government lays any &s;tre&s;s on this &s;tipulation, as authorizing a claim for &s;ome other engagement from us in favor of France, it may be abandoned; and e&s;pecially if its abro|gation can be applied as a &s;et off again&s;t &s;ome exi&s;ting French claim.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 14. If the alterations, already propo&s;ed, are made in the 23d and 24th articles, then this 14th article, as before ob&s;erved, mu&s;t be aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 17. The con&s;truction put on this article by the government of the United States, is conceived to be rea&s;onable and ju&s;t, and is there|fore to be in&s;i&s;ted on. The tribunals of the re&s;pective countries will con|&s;equently be ju&s;tified in taking cognizance of all captures made within their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions; or by illegal privateers; and tho&s;e of one country will be deemed illegal, which are fitted out in the country of the other remaining neutral: &s;eeing to permit &s;uch arming would violate the neutral duties of the latter.</P>
<P>It will be expedient, to fix explicitly, the reception to be given <HI>to public &s;hips of war</HI> of all nations. The French mini&s;ters have demanded, that the public &s;hips of the enemies of France, which at any time, and in any part of the world, had made prize of a French ve&s;&s;el, &s;hould be exclu|ded from the ports of the United States; although they brought in no prize with them. In oppo&s;ition to this demand, we have contended, that they were to be excluded only when they came in with French prizes. And the kind of a&s;ylum to be afforded in all other circum&s;tances, is de|&s;cribed in Mr. Jeffer&s;on's letter to Mr. Hammond, dated the 9th of Sep|tember, 1793, in the following words: "Thus then, the <HI>public &s;hips of war</HI> of both nations (Engli&s;h and French) enjoy a perfect equality in our ports; 1&s;t, in ca&s;es of urgent nece&s;&s;ity; 2d in ca&s;es of comfort or convenience; and 3d, in the time they choo&s;e to continue." And &s;uch &s;helter and accommodation are due to the public &s;hips of all nations on the principal of ho&s;pitality among friendly nations.</P>
<P>It will al&s;o be expedient, explicitly to declare, that the right of a&s;y|lum,
<PB N="46" REF="034817_0045_0FFF84786934A908">&s;tipulated for the armed ve&s;&s;els of France, and their prizes, gives no right to make &s;ale of tho&s;e prizes.</P>
<P>But when prize &s;hips are &s;o di&s;abled, as to be incapable of putting to &s;ea again, until refitted, and when they are utterly di&s;abled; &s;ome provi|&s;ion is nece&s;&s;ary relative to their cargoes. Both ca&s;es occured la&s;t year. The government permitted, though with he&s;itation and caution, the car|goes to be unloaded, one of the ve&s;&s;els to be repaired, and part of the prize goods &s;old, to pay for the repairs, and the cargo of the ve&s;&s;el that was found unfit ever to go to &s;ea again, was allowed to be exported as <HI>prize goods,</HI> even in neutral bottoms. The doubts, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, aro&s;e from the 24th article of the Briti&s;h treaty, forbidding the &s;ale of the prizes of privateers, or the exchanging of the &s;ame in any manner whatever. But as French prizes were entitled to an a&s;ylum in our ports, it was conceived to be a rea&s;onable con&s;truction of it, to allow of &s;uch proceedings as tho&s;e above mentioned, to prevent the total lo&s;s of ve&s;&s;els and cargoes. The 25th article of the Briti&s;h treaty demands attention; as it is therein &s;tipulated, that no future treaty &s;hall be made, that &s;hall be incon&s;i&s;tent with that of the 24th article. Another doubt aro&s;e, whe|ther the Briti&s;h treaty did not, in good faith, require the prohibition of the &s;ale of prizes made by the <HI>National &s;hips</HI> of France, as well as of tho&s;e made by her privateers; e&s;pecially &s;eeing our treaty with France gave her no right to &s;ell any prizes whatever: but upon the whole it was conceived that the United States having before allowed the &s;ale of &s;uch prizes, and the prohibition in the 24th article of the treaty being di&s;tinctly pointed again&s;t the &s;ale of the prizes of <HI>privateers,</HI> it was thought proper to permit the former practice to continue, until the exe|cutive &s;hould make, and publi&s;h, a prohibition of the &s;ale of prizes, or that Congre&s;s &s;hould pa&s;s a prohibitory law.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 22. If in new modelling the treaty with France, the total prohibition of the &s;ale of prizes in the ports of the party remaining neutral, &s;hould not be agreed on, at lea&s;t the right of each power to make, at its plea&s;ure, &s;uch prohibition, whether they are prizes of na|tional &s;hips or privateers, &s;hould be acknowledged, for the rea&s;on more than once &s;ugge&s;ted&mdash;to prevent a repetition of claims upon unfounded con&s;tructions; &s;uch as under the pre&s;ent article, that a <HI>prohibition</HI> to an <HI>enemy</HI> of either party, is a <HI>grant</HI> to the the <HI>other</HI> of the thing forbidden.</P>
<P>ARTICLES 23 and 24. The&s;e have been already con&s;idered, and the alterations propo&s;ed have been mentioned.</P>
<P>There have been &s;o many unju&s;t cau&s;es and pretences a&s;&s;igned for cap|turing and confi&s;cating American ve&s;&s;els, it may perhaps be impo&s;&s;ible to guard again&s;t a repetition of them in any treaty which can be devi&s;ed. To &s;tate the cau&s;es and pretences that have been already advanced by the government of France, its agents and tribunals, as the grounds of the capture and condemnation of American ve&s;&s;els and cargoes, would doubtle&s;s give pain to any man of an ingenious mind, who &s;hould be employed, on the part of France, to negotiate another treaty, or a mo|dification of the treaties which exi&s;t. It is not de&s;ired, therefore, to go farther into detail on the&s;e matters, than &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to guard, by
<PB N="47" REF="034817_0046_0FFF8479F8D88938">explicit &s;tipulations, again&s;t future mi&s;con&s;tructions, and the mi&s;chiefs they will naturally produce.</P>
<P>Under pretence, that certain ports were &s;urrendered to the Engli&s;h, by the treachery of the French and Dutch inhabitants, Victor Hughes and Lebas, the &s;pecial agents of the Executive Directory, at Guada|loupe, have declared that all neutral ve&s;&s;els, bound to or from &s;uch ports, &s;hall be good prize.</P>
<P>Under the pretence that the Briti&s;h were taking all neutral ve&s;&s;els bound to or from French ports, the French agents, at St. Domingo (Santhonax and others) decreed that all <HI>American</HI> ve&s;&s;els, bound to or from Engli&s;h ports, &s;hould be captured; and they have &s;ince declared &s;uch captured ve&s;&s;els to be good prize. The French con&s;uls, in Spain, have on the &s;ame ground condemned a number of American ve&s;&s;els, mere|ly becau&s;e they were de&s;tined to, or coming from an Engli&s;h port.</P>
<P>Under the pretence, that the &s;ea-letters, or pa&s;&s;ports, pre&s;cribed by the commercial treaty, for the mutual advantage of the merchants and navi|gators of the two nations, to &s;ave their ve&s;&s;els from detention and other vexations, when met with at &s;ea, by pre&s;enting &s;o clear a proof of their property, are an indi&s;pen&s;able document to be found on board the French confi&s;cate American ve&s;&s;els de&s;titute of them, even when they acknowledge the property to be American.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e hor&s;es and their military furniture, when de&s;tined to an ene|my's port, are by the 24th article of the commercial treaty declared contraband, and as &s;uch, by them&s;elves, only liable to confi&s;cation, Hu|ghes and Lebas decreed all <HI>neutral ve&s;&s;els</HI> having hor&s;es, or any other con|traband goods on board, &s;hould be good prize; and they accordingly condemned ve&s;&s;els and cargoes.</P>
<P>The ancient ordinances of the French monarchs required a variety of papers to be on board of neutral ve&s;&s;els, the want of any one of which is made a cau&s;e of condemnation; although the 25th article of the com|mercial treaty mentions, what certificates &s;hall accompany the merchant ve&s;&s;els and cargoes of each party, and which, by every rea&s;onable con|&s;truction, ought to give them protection.</P>
<P>It will therefore be advi&s;able to guard again&s;t abu&s;es by de&s;cending to particulars: to de&s;cribe the &s;hips papers which &s;hall be required, and to declare, that the want of any other &s;hall not be a cau&s;e for confi&s;ca|tion: To fix the mode of manning ve&s;&s;els, as to the officers, and to the proportion of the crews who &s;hall be citizens; endeavouring to provide, with re&s;pect to American ve&s;&s;els, that more than one third may be fo|reigners. This provi&s;ion will be important to the Southern States, which have but few native &s;eamen.</P>
<P>The marine ordinances of France, will &s;hew what regulations have been required to be ob&s;erved by allied, as well as neutral powers in general, to a&s;certain and &s;ecure the property of neutrals. Some of the&s;e regulations may be highly proper to be adopted; while others may be inconvenient and burthen&s;ome. Your aim will be to render the documents and for|malities as few, and as &s;imple, as will con&s;i&s;t with a fair and regular com|merce.</P>

ARTICLES 25 and 27. The&s;e two articles &s;hould be rendered con|formable to each other. The 27th &s;ays, that after the exhibition of the <HI>pa&s;sport,</HI> the ve&s;&s;el &s;hall be allowed to pa&s;s without mole&s;tation or &s;earch, without giving her chace, or forcing her to quit her intended cour&s;e. The 25th requires that be&s;ides the <HI>pa&s;sport,</HI> ve&s;&s;els &s;hall be furni&s;hed with certain certificates which of cour&s;e mu&s;t al&s;o be exhibited. It will be ex|pedient to add, that if in the face of &s;uch evidence, the armed ve&s;&s;el will carry the other into port, and the papers are found conformable to treaty, the captors &s;hall be condemned in all the charges, damages, and intere&s;ts thereof, which they &s;hall have cau&s;ed. A provi&s;ion of this nature is made in the eleventh article of our treaty with the United Netherlands.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 28. The prohibited goods here mentioned have no rela|tion to contraband; but merely to &s;uch as <HI>by the laws of the country, are forbidden to be exported.</HI> Yet in the ca&s;e of exporting hor&s;es from Vir|ginia, which no law prohibited; in the winter of 1796, this article was applied by the French mini&s;ter to <HI>hor&s;es,</HI> which, by the French treaty, are contraband of war. And a letter from the Mini&s;ter to Victor Hu|ghes and Lebas, informing them that the American government refu&s;ed to prevent &s;uch export of hor&s;es by the Briti&s;h, is made one ground for their decree above mentioned.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 30. The ve&s;&s;els of the United States ought to be admit|ted into the ports of France, in the &s;ame manner as the ve&s;&s;els of France are admitted into the ports of the United States. But &s;uch a &s;tipulation ought not to authorize the admi&s;&s;ion of ve&s;&s;els of either party into the ports of the other, into which the admi&s;&s;ion of all foreign ve&s;&s;els &s;hall be forbidden by the laws of France, and of the United States re&s;pectively. With this re&s;triction, the principles of the 14th article of the treaty with Great Britain afford a liberal and unexceptionable precedent. A re&s;triction like that here referred to, will be found in the fir&s;t paragraph of the third article of the Briti&s;h treaty.</P>
<P>The commerce to the French colonies in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, will doubtle&s;s be more or le&s;s re&s;tricted, according to the u&s;age of other European nations. Yet on account of the di&s;arranged condition of the French navigation, probably a larger latitude of trade with their colo|nies will be readily permitted for a term of years: and perhaps the mu|tual advantages, then re&s;ulting, will be found &s;o great as to induce after|wards a prolongation of that term; to which the cour&s;e or habit of bu|&s;ine&s;s may contribute.</P>
<P>While between the United States and France, there &s;hall &s;ub&s;i&s;t a perfect reciprocity in re&s;pect to commerce, we mu&s;t endeavour to extend our trade to her colonies to as many articles as po&s;&s;ible. Of the&s;e the mo&s;t impor|tant are provi&s;ions of all kinds, as beef, pork, flour, butter, chee&s;e, fi&s;h, grain, pul&s;e, live &s;tock, and every other article &s;erving for food, which is the produce of the country, hor&s;es, mules, timber, plants, and wood of all kinds, cabinet ware and other manufactures of the Uni|ted States: and to obtain, in return, all the articles of the produce of tho&s;e colonies, without exception; at lea&s;t to the value of the cargoes carried to tho&s;e colonies.</P>

There have been different con&s;tructions of the Con&s;ular Convention. The French have contended for the execution of their con&s;ular deci&s;ions by the mar&s;hal or other officer of the United States; and their mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice, has formerly &s;tated in a report to the mini&s;ter of foreign affairs, that the judicial &s;entences of the American con&s;uls in France will be exe|cuted by certain officers of ju&s;tice in that country. The legal opinion of the law officers of the United States, which the government has adopted, oppo&s;es &s;uch a con&s;truction. The French have al&s;o contended, that de&s;erters from French ve&s;&s;els ought to be ap|prehended by the judicial officers of the United States, upon other evidence than the original &s;hipping paper, or <HI>r&ocirc;le d'&eacute;quipage:</HI> Whereas the di&s;trict judges have in&s;i&s;ted that the Con&s;ular Convention re|quires the original role to be produced. This claim was lately revived by the con&s;ul-general of the French republic. The corre&s;pondence on this occa&s;ion will be joined to the other documents which accompany the&s;e in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>The United States cannot con&s;ent to the erecting of foreign tribunals within their juri&s;diction. We con&s;ider the judicial authority of con|&s;uls, as de&s;cribed in the Con&s;ular Convention, to be voluntary, not com|pul&s;ary, in the country where they re&s;ide: And that their deci&s;ions, if not obeyed by the parties re&s;pectively, mu&s;t be enforced by the laws of their proper country; and &s;uch a provi&s;ion you will &s;ee has been made in France, where a penalty of 1400 livres is impo&s;ed on the citizen who refu&s;es obedience to a con&s;ular deci&s;ion in a foreign &s;tate.</P>
<P>The Con&s;ular Convention will expire in about four years; and if any great difficulties ari&s;e in &s;ettling the terms of a new one, that which exi&s;ts mu&s;t take its cour&s;e: But if the French government &s;hould be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject of the Con&s;ular Convention, &s;ilence may be ob&s;erv|ed on our part.</P>
<P>The ports of the United States being frequented by the ve&s;&s;els of different belligerent powers, it became nece&s;&s;ary to regulate the times of their &s;ailing. The Pre&s;ident, therefore, adopted what was under|&s;tood to be the received rule in Europe; and ordered, that after the &s;ailing of a ve&s;&s;el of one of the belligerent powers, twenty-four hours &s;hould elap&s;e, before an armed ve&s;&s;el of an enemy of the former &s;hould &s;et &s;ail. This rule has not been duly re&s;pected by the armed ve&s;&s;els of France and Great Britain.</P>
<P>As the tranquillity of the United States requires, that no ho&s;tile movements be commenced within their juri&s;diction; and the intere&s;ts of commerce demand an entire freedom to the departure of ve&s;&s;els from their ports, it may be expedient expre&s;&s;ly to recognize the above men|tioned rule.</P>
<P>It will al&s;o be expedient to agree on the extent of territorial juri&s;|diction on the &s;ea coa&s;t, and in what &s;ituations bays and &s;ounds may be &s;aid to be land-locked, and within the juri&s;diction of the &s;overeign of the adjacent country.</P>
<P>On the &s;uppo&s;ition that a treaty will be negotiated to alter and amend
<PB N="50" REF="034817_0049_0FFF847D643034B8">the treaties which now exi&s;t between France and the United States, the following leading principles, to govern the negociation, are &s;ubjoined.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Con&s;cious integrity authori&s;es the government to in&s;i&s;t, that no blame or cen&s;ure be directly, or indirectly, computed to the United States. But on the other hand, however exceptionable in the view of our own government, and in the eyes of an impartial world, may have been the conduct of France, yet &s;he may be unwilling to acknowledge any aggre&s;&s;ions, and we do not wi&s;h to wound her feelings, or to ex|cite re&s;entment. It will therefore be be&s;t to adopt on this point the principle of the Briti&s;h treaty, and <Q>terminate our differences in &s;uch manner, as without referring to the merits of our re&s;pective com|plaints and preten&s;ions, may be the be&s;t calculated to produce mutual &s;atisfaction and good under&s;tanding.</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That no aid be &s;tipulated in favour of France during the pre&s;ent war.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That no engagement be made incon&s;i&s;tent with the obligations of any prior treaty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That no re&s;traint on our lawful commerce, with any other nation, be admitted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That no &s;tipulation be made, under colour of which, tribunals can be e&s;tabli&s;hed within our juri&s;diction, or per&s;onal privileges claim|ed by French citizens, incompatible with the complete &s;overeignty and independence of the United States, in matters of policy, commerce and government.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>It will be expedient to limit the duration of the treaty to a term of from ten to twenty years. Such changes in the circum&s;tances of the two parties are likely to happen within either of tho&s;e periods, as to give one, or both, good rea&s;on to de&s;ire a change in the conditions of the treaty. From this limitation may be excepted &s;uch articles as are decla|ratory of a &s;tate of peace, or as are intended to regulate the conduct of the two nations at the commencement of, or during a &s;tate of war, or which are founded in morality and ju&s;tice, and are in their nature of perpetual obligation. Of this kind may be con&s;idered the tenth article of the treaty with Great Britain; which therefore may be very proper|ly introduced into the treaty with France.</P>
<P>Finally, the great object of the government being to do ju&s;tice to France and her citizens, if in any thing we have injured them; to ob|tain ju&s;tice for the multiplied injuries they have committed again&s;t us: And to pre&s;erve peace, your &s;tyle and manner of proceeding will be &s;uch as &s;hall mo&s;t directly tend to &s;ecure the&s;e objects. There may be &s;uch a change of men and mea&s;ures, in France, as will authorize, perhaps render politic, the u&s;e of &s;trong language, in de&s;cribing the treatment we have received. On the other hand, the French government may be determined to fru&s;trate the negotiation, and throw the odium on this country; in which ca&s;e, any thing like warmth and har&s;hne&s;s would be made the pretext. If things remain in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, the &s;tyle of repre&s;entation will unite, as much as po&s;&s;ible, calm dignity with &s;implicity, force of &s;entiment with mildne&s;s of language, and be calcu|lated
<PB N="51" REF="034817_0050_0FFF84811DB299A0">to impre&s;s an idea of inflexible per&s;everance, rather than of di&s;|tru&s;t or confidence.</P>
<P>With the&s;e in&s;tructions you will receive the following documents.</P>

<ITEM>1. The printed &s;tate papers containing the corre&s;pondence between the Secretary of State and the French Mini&s;ter, Mr. Genet.</ITEM>

<ITEM>4. A report made by the Secretary of State, to the Pre&s;ident of the United States, on the 21&s;t of June, 1797, and by him laid before Congre&s;s on the 22d.</ITEM>
