<P>THE &s;oul of man being a &s;park of im|mortality, infu&s;ed by its Almighty Maker, does &s;till retain a reli&s;h of its original, that it covets knowledge above all other things, not confining its &s;peculation to earth, but towering to Heaven, it &s;earcheth out the Stars and all their various influences; nay, rifles all the Con&s;tellations, unlocking all the &s;ecret cabinet of futurity, and diving into the va&s;t aby&s;&s;es of things un|known: For man
<Q><L>Dame Nature's &s;ecret working doth in&s;pect,</L>
<L>He knows how to advi&s;e, what to direct:</L>
<L>Into the world, by art and &s;cience brings,</L>
<L>And &s;earcheth out the hidden birth of things.</L>
<L>The unplow'd earth he to his will &s;ubdues,</L>
<L>And all it brings forth, he knows how to u&s;e:</L>

<P>Now to &s;atisfy the inqui&s;itive nature of the &s;oul of man, is the de&s;ign of this book, which will gratify his under&s;tanding with the knowledge of the mo&s;t hiden &s;ecrets of art and nature, which the wi&s;dom of the an|cients have hitherto concealed, but here made plain to the meane&s;t capacities.</P>

<P>ONE part of the wi&s;dom of the ancients con&s;i&s;ted in the ob&s;ervation of &s;everal days and times, and from thence foretelling &s;uch good and bad events, as from long experience they found always to follow: And therefore revi&s;ing what ancient a&s;trologers have &s;aid, which I found very defective, I have my&s;elf made an exact judgment of what &s;hould befal men, women and children, by the day of the week on which the fir&s;t day of the year happened to fall: As if it hap|pened to fall on a</P>

there &s;hall be robberies in mo&s;t places, and perhaps war before the end of the year: Al&s;o it denotes the death of prelates and princes, di&s;&s;ention and di&s;cord among men, but not of long continuance.</P>
<P><HI>Monday.]</HI> If New Year's Day fall on <HI>Monday,</HI> ex|pect a hard and cold winter, and a wet &s;ummer, and as a con&s;equence of that, many di&s;ea&s;es; the fruits of the earth very indifferent, which will produce great &s;carcity in &s;ome places: Al&s;o denotes the downfal of the gentry and many marriages among the common people.</P>

<HEAD>Of A&s;trology; what it is.</HEAD>
<P>ASTROLOGY is the Art that teach|es us the influence and effects of the Cele&s;tial Planets upon the bodies of men, women and children, which by their various a&s;pects, po&s;itions and configurations, do fore&s;hew the changes and mutations both of par|ticular bodies, and al&s;o of kingdoms and &s;tates.</P>
<P>Some would confound A&s;tronomy and A&s;trology together, which are in truth different things: And both have their particular u&s;e and excellence. A&s;tron|omy teaches the various and different motions of the planets, and a&s;trology &s;hews their influences and effects; but now that of the &s;igns and planets more di&s;tinctly.

<HEAD>An explanation of the Circle of the Sphere, and &s;ome other Terms in A&s;tronomy, for the ea&s;ier under&s;tanding of this Book, and for further information of the reader.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Equinoctial Circle, Equator,</HI> or <HI>E|quinox,</HI> is a great circle or line equally di&s;tant from the two poles of the world, dividing the &s;phere in the mid&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Zodiack,</HI> is a broad oblique circle cro&s;&s;ing the Equi+noctial in two oppo&s;ite places, <HI>viz.</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Aries</HI> and the beginning of <HI>Libra,</HI> &s;o that half declining towards the <HI>north,</HI> the other towards the <HI>&s;outh;</HI> and in this circle is comprehended the twelve con&s;tellations of &s;igns, every &s;ign containing thirty degrees in length, and twelve in breadth. <HI>Note</HI> al&s;o, That the fir&s;t are northern &s;igns, and the &s;ix la&s;t are &s;outhern &s;igns.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ecliptic Line,</HI> is a line imagined to go along the mid&s;t of the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> as a girdle out of which the &s;un never goeth; but the moon and other planets are &s;ometimes on one &s;ide, and &s;ometimes on the other &s;ide, which is called their latitudes, only the fixed &s;tars alter not their latitude, whether great or &s;mall; but the longitude of a &s;tar is in the arch or part of the <HI>Ecliptic</HI> in degrees, between the beginning of <HI>Aries,</HI> and the cir|cle which pa&s;&s;eth through the body of the &s;tar; where <HI>note,</HI> that all circles of the &s;phere or heavens, whether they are large or &s;mall, have three hundred and &s;ixty degrees allowed to each of them.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030393_0016_0FE6C45091F7FDA8"><HI>Colures</HI> are &s;aid to be two great moveable circles cro&s;&s;ing each other at the poles of the world, one cut|ting the Equinox at the beginning of <HI>Aries</HI> and at the beginning of <HI>Libra,</HI> and the other cutting the Ecliptic at the beginning of <HI>Cancer</HI> and at the beginning of <HI>Ca|pricorn;</HI> and &s;o dividing the globe into four equal parts.</P>
<P><HI>Horizon</HI> is a great circle which divideth the upper hemi&s;phere, that is the upper hall of the world from the lower, we being always &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the mid&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Meridian</HI> is a great circle pa&s;&s;ing through the poles of the world, and the poles of the horizon, called <HI>Ze|nith</HI> and the <HI>Nadir</HI> (which are two points, one di|rectly over our heads the other directly under our feet) on which the &s;un is always ju&s;t at noon; and to go di|rectly north and &s;outh, the meridian is changed; but to go ea&s;t and we&s;t it is changed to &s;ixty miles either way, and make one degree, of four minutes of time dif|ference under the Equinox, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ixty miles ea&s;tward, it is noon four minutes &s;ooner, and &s;ixty miles we&s;t|ward four minutes later.</P>
<P><HI>Tropicks</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to be two le&s;&s;er circles, paral|lel with the Equinoctial, and di&s;tant from it on either &s;ide, twenty three degrees, thirty one minutes each; the ecliptic line touches the <HI>Tropick</HI> of <HI>Cancer</HI> on the north &s;ide of the equinoctial, and it touches the <HI>Tropic</HI> of <HI>Capricorn</HI> on the &s;outh &s;ide thereof, &s;o that the &s;un hath its motion between the&s;e two circles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Artick Circle</HI> is equally di&s;tant from the north pole, as the <HI>Tropicks</HI> are di&s;tant from the <HI>Equinox</HI> twen|ty three degrees, thirty one minutes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Antarctic Circle</HI> is the &s;ame di&s;tance from the &s;outh pole.</P>
<P><HI>Zones,</HI> &s;o called are five in number, two cold, two temperate and one hot, which are divided by the two <HI>Tropicks</HI> and polar circles from each other; the hot
<PB N="18" REF="030393_0017_0FE6C415A0500C88">
Zone is counted between the two <HI>Tropicks</HI> that is ex|tended from one to the other, being about forty &s;even degrees two minutes broad; the temperate Zones are extended from the <HI>Tropicks</HI> on either &s;ide, to about fortytwo degrees &s;ixtyeight minutes, that is northward to the <HI>Artick</HI> circle and &s;outhward to the <HI>antarctick</HI> cir|cle and the two cold Zones are each within tho&s;e two &s;mall circles having the poles for their center.</P>
<P>The <HI>poles of the Worlds,</HI> are two points exactly oppo|&s;ite to each other in the heavens, one in the north, the other in the &s;outh, the earth being in the mid&s;t, &s;o that it &s;eems to turn about, as if it were borne up by them; wherefore by &s;ome it is termed the axletree of the world, as if there was a line &s;uppo&s;ed to be drawn from one pole through the center of the earth to the other, and the earth turning thereon, though holy writ tells us, <HI>The Lord hangeth the earth upon nothing, it being upholden by his mighty power.</HI> The pole artick, or north pole, is elevated above our horizon above fiftyone degrees; and tho&s;e &s;tars within that di&s;tance from it, never &s;et with us, but keep their cour&s;e round it daily; &s;o likewi&s;e tho&s;e that are at that di&s;tance from the &s;outh pole, never ri&s;e with us, but perform their cour&s;e in the like order.</P>
<P><HI>Azimuths</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed lines or circles of di&s;tance from the meridian, drawn from the zenith to any de|gree, or two degrees of the horizon, or according to the thirty two points of the mariner's compa&s;s, &s;o that in travelling or &s;ailing any way &s;uppo&s;ing a circle to go from our zenith directly before us to the horizon, is the <HI>Azimuth,</HI> called the verticle point as well as the ze|nith.</P>
<P><HI>Almicantharats,</HI> or <HI>Almadarats,</HI> or circles of altitude, are imagined circles pa&s;&s;ing through the meridian, parallel with the horizon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sphere</HI> is a round body, pre&s;enting the frame of the whole world, as the circles of the heaven and the
<PB N="19" REF="030393_0018_0FE6C4582CAB2A58">
earth; this is &s;ometimes called a martial &s;phere, for the orbs of the planets are called their &s;pheres, that is the circles in which they move.</P>
<P><HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> is the ri&s;ing of any &s;tar, or of any part of the ecliptic above the horizon, <HI>De&s;cen&s;ion</HI> is its going down.</P>
<P><HI>Right a&s;cen&s;ion of a &s;tar,</HI> is that part of the equinox that ri&s;eth or &s;etteth with a &s;tar in a right &s;phere, but in an oblique &s;phere, it is that part of the equinoctial in degrees, containing between the fir&s;t point of <HI>Aries,</HI> and that place of the equinoctial which pa&s;&s;eth by the meridian with the center of the &s;tar.</P>
<P><HI>Oblique A&s;cention</HI> is a part of the equinoctial in de|grees, contained betwixt the beginning of <HI>Aries,</HI> and that of the equinox, which ri&s;eth with any &s;tar, or part of the ecliptic, in an oblique &s;phere.</P>
<P><HI>A&s;&s;ential difference,</HI> is the difference betwixt the right and oblique a&s;cention, or the number of degrees con|tained between that place and the equinox that ri&s;eth with the center of a &s;tar, and that place of the equinox that cometh to the meridian with the &s;ame &s;tar.</P>
<P><HI>Sol&s;tice</HI> is in the &s;ummer, when the &s;un is in the be|ginning of <HI>Cancer;</HI> and in the winter when the &s;un en|ters into <HI>Capricorn;</HI> becau&s;e then the days &s;eem to &s;tand &s;till, and &s;eem neither to increa&s;e nor decrea&s;e above two minutes in ten or twelve days.</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;tellation</HI> is a certain number of &s;tars, &s;uppo&s;ed to be limited within &s;ome form or likene&s;s, as <HI>Aries</HI> the ram, is &s;aid to have thirteen &s;tars; <HI>Taurus</HI> the bull thirtythree: <HI>Arcturus, Orion</HI> and the <HI>Pleiades,</HI> mention|ed in <HI>Job.</HI> ix. 9. are &s;aid to be <HI>Con&s;tellations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Perihelium</HI> is the point wherein the earth, or any planet, is neare&s;t the &s;un.</P>
<P><HI>Aphelium</HI> is a point wherein the earth, or any planet, is farther from the &s;un.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Sun's Revolution through the <HI>12</HI> Sings of the Zo|diac; with an A&s;trological Judgment of tho&s;e that &s;hall be born, when the Sun is in any of the&s;e Signs.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH there be &s;even planets (as we have before &s;hewed) yet the &s;un and moon being the two great luminaries of the world, have greater influ|ence upon our bodies than all the re&s;t, and the &s;un &s;hining by his ow light, and being the fountain of both light and life, has greater power than the moon, and his influence is more in any of the twelve hou&s;es. I therefore here (becau&s;e I affect brevity) give the reader an a&s;trologic judgment of the &s;un's power and influence, being in any of the twelve hou&s;es; after I have fir&s;t ac|quainted my reader what a hou&s;e is, and &s;ignifies in a&s;trology.</P>
<P>A hou&s;e is a certain &s;pace in the firmament, which is parted and &s;eparated by &s;everal degrees, by which the planets have their motion metaphorically, called hou&s;es.
<PB N="22" REF="030393_0021_0FE6C3F656F2DCD8">
For as in a hou&s;e there may be many man&s;ions, for eve|ry planet has a peculiar or proper place in the firmament, in which it moves and in which it is re&s;ident, contain|ing thirty degrees, by which one hou&s;e is differenced from another, and the&s;e are thus placed by A&s;trologers, viz.</P>
<P>The &s;un being in <HI>Aries,</HI> makes a per&s;on born under it of a toward and peevi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, quickly angry, but as &s;oon plea&s;ed; given to &s;tudy and very eloquent, but proud, living luxurious, promi&s;ing all things, but performing nothing; not beloved among his kindred, and obnoxious to danger among his enemies; he &s;hall be in danger of receiving harm from four footed bea&s;ts, or being thrown from a hor&s;e, and the like; &s;o that he ought to avoid all hawking, hunting, and oth|er exerci&s;e to be performed on hor&s;ecback, which are like to be fatal to him, but in other things he may be more fortunate. If the per&s;on born be a female, though &s;he may be fair and fruitful in children, yet &s;he will be given to lying, and of &s;o bad a temper and di&s;po&s;ition that her hu&s;band will live but unea&s;y with her. <HI>Note,</HI> this al&s;o, that tho&s;e born in the day time, the &s;un being in <HI>Aries,</HI> will be fortunate aad happy, but tho&s;e that are born in the night, will be unfortunate and come to di&s;grace.</P>
<P>The &s;un being in <HI>Taurus,</HI> makes the native bold and fortunate in attempting hard and difficult affairs; it &s;hews him al&s;o victorious over his enemies, and a great traveller, but bani&s;hed from his native country. It al&s;o &s;hews one &s;ervile, familiar and angry, but in his old age only; for in his youth he &s;hall obtain rich|es by marriage, which &s;hall make him better honored. But when age comes, it brings &s;ickne&s;s with it, and that makes men peevi&s;h.</P>
<P>It makes females wanton, yet painful and obedient, but full of <HI>Tittle Tattle;</HI> it al&s;o &s;hews them inclined to whoredom, which will wear off by degrees; &s;he &s;hall have many hu&s;bands and divers children.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="030393_0022_0FE6C45C598CD520">The &s;un being in <HI>Gemini,</HI> denotes a fair child, al&s;o one that is wi&s;e, liberal and merciful, al&s;o a boa&s;ter, and one that runs up and down without any regard to his bu&s;ine&s;s, whereby he &s;hall obtain but little riches of his own, but &s;hall be of that fidelity and truth, that he &s;hall have the command of the public trea&s;ure: It al&s;o denotes one to be of a complai&s;ant behaviour, a good under&s;tanding, and acceptable to tho&s;e with whom he has to do. It &s;hews him al&s;o to be well ver&s;|ed in the mathematical &s;cience and arithmetic; and that he &s;hall be in great danger about three and twen|ty years of age, either to be hurt by fire, or bitten by a mad dog.</P>
<P>The &s;un being in <HI>Cancer,</HI> &s;hews a per&s;on to be of a good wit, humility and wi&s;dom, but one inclined to plea&s;ure, and the love of women. It al&s;o &s;hews one attempting many things, and e&s;pecially on &s;eas, and thereby often in danger, and vexed with many incom|modities, and with much poverty and mi&s;ery, and that though he may get much, yet he may be never the richer; he &s;hall dig for trea&s;ure, and &s;hall find that which he looked not for: But if it be a maid, &s;he &s;hall be witty, &s;hamefaced, evil, wi&s;e, diligent, nimble and beautiful, &s;oon plea&s;ed, yet deceitful and crafty, &s;aying one thing, and doing another, &s;ubject to many dangers by water, by falling, by childbearing and chol|ic; and after the age of twenty&s;ix, whether the native, male or female, it promi&s;eth good &s;ucce&s;s. It denotes al&s;o a per&s;on to be painful, faithful, acquainted with great men, and fortunate in hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>The &s;un being in <HI>Leo,</HI> denotes a man proud and ar|rogant, bold and &s;tout; a mocker, &s;corner, unmerciful, cruel, and hard to be entreated; be&s;et with many ene|mies, and &s;ubject to many mi&s;eries; al&s;o a captain or other commander, looking for promotion from great men, unfortunate children, and meeting with many af|flictions by their means, putting him&s;elf into many dangers; he &s;hall be al&s;o in danger by fire or &s;word, and
<PB N="24" REF="030393_0023_0FE6C420CFBD4430">
violence of bea&s;ts, by whom he &s;hall be in danger of death; but with prudence may e&s;cape all threatened dangers.</P>
<P>But if the native be of the female &s;ex, &s;he &s;hall be bold, have great and large brea&s;ts, and &s;lender legs, which are tokens of &s;toutne&s;s, angers, &s;landers, and bab|bling; though the &s;oftne&s;s natural to women do allevi|ate the exce&s;s thereof. She ought however to be e&s;|pecially careful of hot waters, and fire, by which &s;he will be in great danger; &s;he &s;hall al&s;o be much inclined to &s;ickne&s;s, or gnawing of the &s;tomach. But after the age of twentyone years, &s;he &s;hall be fortunate in riches, which &s;he &s;hall obtain by the help of great men, and the u&s;e of other men's goods: al&s;o by hou&s;ekeeping, beauty and love.</P>
<P>The &s;un being in <HI>Virgo,</HI> makes the men fortunate and &s;ucce&s;sful in hou&s;hold affairs, wi&s;e and fruitful, &s;tout and ambitious: his wife &s;hall die &s;uddenly in his ab&s;ence; he &s;hall have many things &s;tolen from him, but &s;hall be revenged on his enemies. He &s;hall be &s;o much given to talk, that he cannot keep his own &s;e|crets.&mdash; It al&s;o &s;hews one fairfaced, of a genteel beha|viour, a lover of women, and delightful to be in the courts of princes and noblemen. It al&s;o denotes one wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and honorable, a patron and defender of his friends, al&s;o religious and temperate, of a comely per|&s;onage, and well featured. If the native be a maiden, &s;he will be witty, hone&s;t and mode&s;t; of a willing mind diligent and circum&s;pect; and &s;hall be married about the age of fifteen years. But whether male or female, they &s;hall be liable to meet with many afflictions.</P>
<P>The &s;un being in <HI>Libra,</HI> denotes the per&s;on to be for|tunate in all maritime affairs, and that he gains by trad|ing in &s;pices and precious &s;tones. It al&s;o &s;hews a come|ly body, and a valuable plea&s;ant tongue, a good fame, and one curious to under&s;tand &s;ecrets, but not very careful to perform what he promi&s;es, how much &s;oever he may pretend to it. It &s;hews al&s;o that he &s;hall
<PB N="25" REF="030393_0024_0FE6C45C69591540">
have &s;everal wives, and that he &s;hall quickly bury the fir&s;t. He may al&s;o be a gainer by dead men, who will leave him large legacies. He &s;hall be a lover of wom|en and entertain unlawful familiararities with them. He &s;hall be al&s;o a good interpreter of dreams, whether he be born by day or night. If the native be of the female &s;ex, &s;he &s;hall be free and debonair, and of a jo|cund humour, taking much delight in herbs, loving the fields, and wandering into &s;trange places. About 23 years of age &s;he &s;hall have a hu&s;band, and be happy, married for her beauty; plea&s;antne&s;s of conver&s;ation, and good behaviour, &s;hall much promote her. Like|wi&s;e the children of <HI>Libra</HI> are &s;uch as are &s;tudious and lovers of learning; but without &s;pecial care be taken, they may receive prejudice by fire or &s;calding water.</P>
<P>The &s;un being in <HI>Scorpio</HI> increa&s;es the natives in|heritence, and give them a boldne&s;s and &s;toutne&s;s, in|clining them likewi&s;e to flattery, by which means tho&s;e they deal with are often deceived; and when they ex|pect bread may meet with nothing but a <HI>&s;corpion.</HI> It likewi&s;e denotes a per&s;on full of mirth, given to je&s;t|ing and ea&s;y of belief, at the &s;ame time a conquerer of his enemies. It makes a woman to be full of craft and wit, and yet her hu&s;band &s;hall deceive her. She &s;hall likewi&s;e be &s;ubject to pain and the &s;pleen, and have &s;ome extraordinary mark, either in the head, &s;houlder, or brawn of the arm.</P>
<P>It makes both &s;exes bold and ra&s;h, given to thiev|ing, and to &s;earch out hidden things, al&s;o it makes them wanton fornicators, and full of evil thoughts, and given to too much talking.</P>
<P>The &s;un being in <HI>Sagittary,</HI> gives fortune and bold|ne&s;s to take in hand an enterpri&s;e, inclining a per&s;on to travel, and take vovages at &s;ea and journies by land, and not without con&s;iderable advantage; it al&s;o gives acce&s;s into courts of princes, where the native &s;hall be advanced to &s;ome honourable po&s;t. It al&s;o &s;hews a per|&s;on given to riding, hunting, hawking, leaping, fight|ing
<PB N="26" REF="030393_0025_0FE6C420DF0FC458">
and &s;uch manly exerci&s;es, at which he always comes off with honor, by which means he is envied and has many enemies, whom yet he &s;hall vanqui&s;h and and overcome. It al&s;o &s;hews he &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s the inher|itence of his father, and that he &s;hall be ju&s;t, ingeni+ous, faithful, hearty, a &s;ure friend, and a generous en|emy. If the native be a woman, it likewi&s;e betokens the &s;ame; &s;he &s;hall be indu&s;trious, of an excellent temper; &s;he &s;hall be envied by her enemies, but &s;hall overcome them; &s;he &s;hall be married about &s;eventeen, and have many children.</P>
<P>The &s;un being in <HI>Capricorn,</HI> &s;hews the native &s;hall meet with many afflictions and adver&s;ities, which he &s;hall &s;u&s;tain with many re&s;olutions: Yet it always &s;hews him angry and fretful, and one that keeps bad com|pany. It al&s;o makes him merry and cheerful; yet he may fall in love to that degree, that he may be ready to die for his mi&s;tre&s;s; but if the nativity be by night, he &s;hall be incon&s;tant; it al&s;o &s;hews in age he &s;hall be covetous. He &s;hall thrive in navigation, e&s;pecially in the trade towards the ea&s;t, for from thence his fortune &s;hall ari&s;e. If the native be a woman, &s;he will be mode&s;t and ba&s;hful, of a fearful di&s;po&s;ition, and very much addicted to travel.</P>
<P>The &s;un being in <HI>Aquarius,</HI> maketh the native of a friendly di&s;po&s;ition, fearful of waters, and in danger of receiving prejudice thereby; he &s;hall be &s;ubject to &s;ickne&s;s and quartidian agues until about the fifteenth year of his age, after which he &s;hall be more fortunate, for by travelling through divers countries, he &s;hall gath|er riches, which with a liberal hand he &s;hall di&s;tri|bute; he &s;hall meet with &s;undry lo&s;&s;es and afflictions, e&s;pecially by means of his wife and other women; and &s;hall live for a long time without the enjoyment of her. But &s;he being dead, his affairs will be more fortunate. If the native be a woman, &s;he &s;hall be comely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> body, and of a faithful and can&s;tant mind: &s;he &s;hall be en|riched with other men's goods, but her children &s;hall
<PB N="27" REF="030393_0026_0FE6C4624FACA260">
be a great affliction to her, and &s;he &s;hall receive much damage by them. She &s;hall not attain to any great fortune until the two and twentieth year of her age, and then &s;he &s;hall arrive to a competent e&s;tate.</P>
<P>The &s;un being in <HI>Pi&s;ces</HI> denotes a man to be quick, of a valuable and ready tongue, bold and conceited, but fortunate in finding out hidden trea&s;ure: for this is peculiar to tho&s;e who are born when the &s;un is in <HI>Pi&s;ces,</HI> that they &s;hall find &s;omething unlooked for, and &s;hall be al&s;o enriched with other men's goods; it al&s;o &s;hews them to be merry and joco&s;e, of a good di&s;po&s;ition, and loving the company of good men; they &s;eldom live very long, but if they reach to thirtyfive years they may live to a good old age. They &s;hall never be very rich, except in their own opinions; they are al|ways full of unea&s;y thoughts, and are in danger of be|ing brought into captivity by means of women; they have commonly &s;ome mark in the elbow or foot, and their fortune will come from the mouth. If the na|tive be a woman, &s;he will be bold, contumelious, &s;cold, and &s;omething wor&s;e, for &s;he will for&s;ake her own hu&s;|band, and cleave to an adulterer.</P>
<P>Thus I have given an account of the influences of the &s;un, being in any of the cele&s;tial &s;igns, by which any per&s;on may know in what &s;ign the &s;un was at the time of his birth.</P>

<P>This Table is &s;o ea&s;y, it needs little explanation.&mdash; Its u&s;e is to find what planet rules any hour of the day, every day in the week. As for example, I de&s;ire to know what planet rules on Wedne&s;day, at 7 o'clock at night; under the title of Wedne&s;day, I look for 9, which an&s;wers to 7 o'clock at night; for the natural day con&s;i&s;ts of 24 hours, beginning after midnight, &s;o that from 12 at noon, you begin to reckon 13, 14 15, &amp;c. you find that the 19th hour from midnight, an|&s;wers to 7 o'clock at night, over again&s;t which you will find &Sun; which &s;hews that to be the hour of the
<PB N="31" REF="030393_0030_0FE6C468B8D51A50">
&s;un. And if you would know what planet rules at 7 in the morning that day, you will find again&s;t &Venus; 7, which &s;hews that <HI>Venus</HI> rules that hour; and &s;o of any other hour in the day.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall now come to &s;peak of the &s;ignifications of the planetary hours of each planet, and what it por|tends to tho&s;e that are born in them. The hour of <HI>Saturn</HI> is &s;trong, and is good to do all things that re|quire &s;trength: Such as fighting or bearing burdens, or the like; but for tho&s;e things it is very evil. He that is born in the hour of <HI>Saturn,</HI> is &s;low, dull and melancholy, of a dogged temper and di&s;po&s;ition, black and &s;warthy of complexion, being quarrel&s;ome, wrath|ful, and very malicious.</P>
<P>The hour of <HI>Jupiter</HI> is in all things good, and de|notes peace, love and concord: He that is born in the hour of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> is of a ruddy and &s;andy complexion, fair hair, well proportioned body, and of a lovely coun|tenance, his face rather broad than long, well &s;poken and courteous, of a very affable carriage, &s;ober, ju&s;t and religious. The hour of <HI>Mars</HI> is evil, and denotes the per&s;on born in it, to be of a cholerick con&s;titution, and of a robu&s;t &s;trong body, &s;oon angry, and hard to be reconciled; his face red, and his eyes &s;parkling and fiery, much addicted to fighting, and ready to quarrel with every man he meets, which often times brings him to an untimely end. The hour of the <HI>Sun</HI> &s;igni|fies great &s;trength, and is very unfortunate for kings and princes. He that is born in that hour, hath &s;harp eyes, brown hair, and a round face, denotes one that is a great projector, aims at high things, but is often di&s;|appointed, and &s;eldom brings his de&s;igns to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The hour of <HI>Venus</HI> is very propitious and fortunate, but is better by night than day, e&s;pecially mid-day, for then the &s;un covers it. He that is born in this hour hath fair hair, &s;oft eyes, a little forehead, and round beard; very complai&s;ant in his carriage, mighty am|orous, and a great admirer of women; much addicted
<PB N="32" REF="030393_0031_0FE6C41D8C32AA58">
to &s;inging and gaming, and &s;pends his money in court|ing the female &s;ex.</P>
<P>The hour of <HI>Mercury</HI> is very good, but chiefly from the beginning to the middle: He that is born in this hour, his &s;ituation inclining to tallne&s;s, a &s;harp long face, long eyes, and a long no&s;e: His forehead narrow, long beard and thin hair, long arms and long fingers; of a good di&s;po&s;ition, and an obliging temper, much given to reading, and very de&s;irous of knowledge, de|lighting to be among books; very eloquent in his &s;peech, and yet addicted to lying; and if he be poor, he is commonly light fingered.</P>
<P>The hour or the <HI>Moon</HI> is both good and evil, ac|cording to the day: For from the 4th to the 17th it is good to tho&s;e that are born under it; but from the 17th to the 20th, it is counted unfortunate to be born under it; and from the 20th to the 27th, very unhap|py. He that is born in the hour of the <HI>Moon,</HI> e&s;pecial|ly upon her own day, &s;hall be pale faced, of a thin, meagre vi&s;age, with hollow eyes, and of a middle &s;tat|ure, he appears very courteous and obliging, but is very crafty and deceitful, &s;etting about many things, but &s;o incon&s;tant and variable in his humour, that he is pre&s;|ently off of them again, and &s;etting about &s;omething el&s;e; in&s;omuch, that what he cries up in one hour, he &s;hall as much cry down the next; he is al&s;o very ma|licious, and will never forget an affront once offered him, his con&s;titution phlegmatic.</P>
<P>Thus have I given the reader the judgment of the ancients upon the planetary hours, and what they portend to tho&s;e that are born under them, by which a per&s;on, comparing him&s;elf with what is here &s;et down, may ea&s;ily know under what planet he was born.</P>

<P><HI>Saturn</HI> governs the right ear, the bladder and the bones; and the di&s;ea&s;es he governs, are quartian agues, concerns, black choler, rheums, coughs, pal&s;ies, loo&s;e|ne&s;s of the blood, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Jupiter</HI> governs the lungs, ribs, liver, &s;eeds, arteries, and left ear; and the di&s;ea&s;es incident to them, are pleuricies and apoplexies, and &s;uch as proceed from 100 great a quantity of blood, or from wind in any part of the body.</P>
<P><HI>Mars</HI> governs the gall, the veins and the reigns, and their di&s;tempers; which are fevers, yellow jaun|dice, madne&s;s, choler carbuncles. <HI>Mars</HI> al&s;o governs the &s;tones and privy members of man or woman in part.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sun</HI> governs the eyes, heart, and right &s;ide, and the di&s;ea&s;es relating to them; &s;uch as colds, e&s;pecially in the &s;tomach and liver, fluxes in the eyes, cramp, headach, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Venus</HI> governs the liver, loins, matrix, paps and throat: The di&s;ea&s;es whereof are weakne&s;s in the body, and members, catarrhs, French pox, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Mercury</HI> governs the brain, thought, memory, &s;peech and tongue, and al&s;o the di&s;tempers incident thereto, are falling &s;ickne&s;s, madne&s;s, coughs, hoar&s;ene&s;s, &s;tam|mering, phthy&s;ic, and rheums.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moon</HI> governs the left eye of a man, and the right eye of a woman, al&s;o the &s;tomach, belly, and the
<PB N="34" REF="030393_0033_0FE6C468CCD4D210">
left &s;ide; and the di&s;ea&s;es proper to them, are drop&s;ies, pal&s;ies, rotten coughs, &s;urfeits, worms in children, king's evil, falling &s;ickne&s;s, convul&s;ion fits, dimne&s;s of &s;ight, &s;mall pox, and mea&s;les. <HI>Here note,</HI> That in all di&s;tempers, before you apply any thing to the patient, it is proper and nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult the motions and po&s;itions of the planets; and when by the table of planetary hours before recited, you know what plan|et rules; you mu&s;t in the next place con&s;ider the na|ture of that planet, as whether it be fierce or cruel, as <HI>Mars;</HI> or friendly and benevolent, as <HI>Jupiter;</HI> al&s;o whether they be cold and moi&s;t, or hot and dry, and what is the predominent complexion, whether the &s;anguine choler, phlegm or melancholy; as al&s;o what member of the body it governs, and what di&s;ea&s;e is under its power. The&s;e things being diligently weigh|ed and con&s;idered, will furni&s;h the ingenious phy&s;ician with grounds &s;ufficient to make a judgment of the true nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, whereby he may apply the &s;uita|ble and proper remedies that &s;hall be&s;t con&s;i&s;t with, and the mo&s;t prevalent again&s;t the de&s;temper; where|as the want of a due con&s;ideration of the matter, cau&s;e the phy&s;icians oftentimes to admini&s;ter tho&s;e med|icines that rather kill than cure, though the&s;e very med|icines may be good again&s;t the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e to a patient under other circum&s;tances, and falling &s;ick un|der a different po&s;ition of the &s;igns and planets.</P>

<P>AS I have found in the A&s;trological Science there are four different &s;ort of humours in the the body of man, of which the four complexions are formed and of the&s;e one is made of yellow choler, a|nother of black choler, a third phlegm, and a fourth of blood: And if any of the&s;e be wanting the body mu&s;t peri&s;h, becau&s;e they equally &s;u&s;tain it.</P>
<P>And all tho&s;e ought to be kept in an equality, or if one be predominent over the re&s;t, it puts the body out of order and brings di&s;ea&s;es, which many times end in death, for the blood &s;tagnated and gathering into clots, cau&s;eth &s;hortne&s;s of breath, which by degrees growing le&s;s and le&s;s, at la&s;t proves without remedy; but if a per&s;on be let blood in the beginning of tho&s;e di&s;order|ed humours, the danger may be ea&s;ily prevented. To purge the blood.</P>

Take a pint every morning, and at four in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e the black choler, or melancholy, is extreme|ly dangerous, and when it gains the a&s;cendant over the other, do great prejudice to the body &s;everal ways, cau&s;ing divers di&s;tempers; and &s;ometimes prevails &s;o much over the &s;en&s;es, that a man becomes in a man|ner a mere ideot, and al&s;o rai&s;es a kind of &s;curf all o|ver the body, which &s;ometimes turns to the mea&s;les, and are, be&s;ides, very apt to make a man afraid even of his own &s;hadow, and turn a &s;tout man into a coward, and a well bred per&s;on into one that is unmannerly: But by the u&s;e of proper medicines, &s;uch as herbs, flowers, and the like, all this may either be prevented or cured:&mdash;Fir&s;t &s;have the head, then bleed plentiful|ly, afterwards purge well with the extract of Hellebore; la&s;tly, let them u&s;e the following diet drink.</P>

White Phlegm is al&s;o very hurtful, if it exceed in quantity and overpower the other humours, for then they cau&s;e the gout, and divers di&s;ea&s;es, and are al&s;o prejudicial to the feet, legs knees, hands and reins, cau&s;ing evil favor both from the teeth, mouth, no&s;e and ears; but al&s;o this may be cured by med|icines compounded of roots and flowers; likewi&s;e by phy&s;ical drinks, and taking a vomit.</P>

<P>Yellow Choler, is likewi&s;e very bad when it predom|inates in the body, affecting the heart, and troubling the brain, and indeed weakening all the members of the body, cau&s;ing a general faintne&s;s, with &s;uch a lo&s;s of appetite, that neither meat nor drink will go down:&mdash; Be&s;ides which, it alters a man's colour, and is hurtful to the eye&s;ight.

<P>For the drop&s;y, let blood on the right &s;ide, between the womb and the branch. <HI>And here, note,</HI> the party &s;hould bleed proportionable, according to their fatne&s;s, or leanne&s;s, and this ought not to be done without the advice of a doctor.</P>
<P>For blotches and impo&s;thumes proceeding from the groin, let blood in the vein named <HI>Sophon,</HI> which is one of the three under the ankle of the foot. It is al&s;o of great advantage to cour&s;es to de&s;cend in men, and to prevent the <HI>Hemorrhoides</HI> in the &s;ecret parts.</P>
<P>When any per&s;on is taken by the pe&s;tilence, cau&s;ed by repletion of humours, let them bleed in the vein that is between the wri&s;t of the feet, and the great toe;&mdash; but let the patient be &s;ure to bleed within twentyfour hours after he is fir&s;t &s;eized with this di&s;temper, and let
<PB N="45" REF="030393_0044_0FE6C4BB77D8A950">
it be with re&s;pect to the patient's body whether it be fat or lean.</P>
<P>If the eyes run with water, or be red, or any other ill, proceeding from the overflowing of blood and hu|mours; let the patient bleed in two veins that are in the angle of the eyes.</P>
<P>If the no&s;e be red and pimpled, and the face be red and pimpled in the like manner, and be troubled with red drops, &s;cabs, pi&s;tules and other infections, that may proceed from too much blood; let the patient bleed in the vein which is at the end of the no&s;e.</P>
<P>For the toothache, and the canker in the mouth, let the party troubled be let blood in the four veins that are in the gums in the mouth. Tho&s;e that are taint|ed with a &s;tinking breath, let them be let blood in the vein that is between the lip and the chin.</P>
<P>There are four veins in each arm, the bigge&s;t of the four is from the head, the heart challenges the &s;econd, and the third from the liver; the la&s;t is called the low|er liver vein, and comes from the melt. The&s;e differ|ent veins &s;hould be bled upon different occa&s;ions: As for in&s;tance, for pains in the head, eyes, brain, heart, &s;weeled faces, and tho&s;e that are red; it is mo&s;t proper to bleed that vein in the arm which has relation to the head. For fevers, either tertains or quartans, the low|er liver vein is the mo&s;t proper to be blooded; but then care mu&s;t be taken that the orifice be made wider, and not &s;o deep as u&s;ual, le&s;t thereby it not only gathers wind, but al&s;o damages a &s;inew that is underneath it, called the lizard.</P>
<P>There are three veins in each, and that above the thumb is proper to bleed, in order to remove the heat of the face, and to di&s;&s;ipate the thick blood, and hu|mours that are in the head, this vein being more proper than the arm.</P>
<P>Again&s;t all fevers, tertains and quartans, phlegms, and other ob&s;tructions about the paps and the melt,
<PB N="46" REF="030393_0045_0FE6C47C8BDB1860">
letting blood between the little finger and the leech finger, helps very much.</P>
<P>Again&s;t pain and humours in the groin and geni|tals, bleed a vein in the thigh.</P>
<P>Again&s;t pains in the flanks, and to di&s;&s;ipate all hu|mours that would gather therein, and to re&s;train too great a flux in the men&s;trues in women, it exceeding|ly helps to bleed the vein under the ankle of the foot, without, which is called the Sciot.</P>

Of the head.</HI> A large head &s;hews a per&s;on &s;tupid and of a dull ap|prehen&s;ion, al&s;o a very &s;mall head &s;ignifies the &s;ame; but the head of a man being neither great nor &s;mall, is the progno&s;tic of a wi&s;e man; for all extremes are irregular, and a deviation from nature; and experience has made it manife&s;t, that a great head and &s;mall mem|bers, do always produce much indi&s;cretion and folly, both in man or woman; but we mu&s;t al&s;o con&s;ider the &s;everal parts of the head: And fir&s;t,</P>
<P><HI>Of the Hair.</HI>] The hair is only the excre&s;ence of a moi&s;t brain; yet the ancients ob&s;erve &s;everal things from it; as, if the hair be thin, it &s;hews a man to be of a weak con&s;titution; but if curled and thick, it &s;hews the per&s;on to be of a hot complexion: If the hair be &s;tiff, and &s;tand upright, either upon the head, or any other part of the body, it &s;hews the per&s;on extreme|ly

&s;ubject to fear, and very apt to be frighted. If the hair be thick and lank, it &s;hews the per&s;on to be meek and humble, and his con&s;titution inclined to cold.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Forehead.</HI>] A large forehead &s;hews a liberal man; but the forehead narrow, denotes a fooli&s;h per|&s;on: A long forehead &s;hews one apt to learn, and a high forehead, &s;welling and round, is a &s;ign of a crafty man, and a coward; a forehead full of wrinkles, &s;hews a man to be envious and crafty.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Eyes.</HI>] The eyes being moi&s;t and clear, &s;hews mirth, good manners, and an hone&s;t life, but if the eyes be declining and looking downward, or red and very great, they betoken fle&s;hy lu&s;t; &s;mall hallow eyes &s;ignify covetou&s;ne&s;s; grey eyes an evil man, hollow eyes a crafty man, rolling eyes a wicked and vicious man, black eyes denote a &s;harp and piercing wit, but one lu&s;tful and incontinent; great eyes denote &s;loth; trembling eyes &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s; glittering eyes betokens drunkenne&s;s; &s;milling eyes &s;hew a merry life; eyes of divers colours,, and &s;mall, denote one crafty and flat|tering; eyes turned towards the no&s;e, &s;hew a man given to women; great drooping eyes, with an un&s;ta|ble countenance, &s;hew a man mad; the circle of the ball green, declares a crafty wicked man, and a thief; moi&s;t eyes denote &s;toutne&s;s of &s;tomach, perfect &s;peech gluttonous and mad; high eyes, large, clear, pure and moi&s;t, are tokens of circum&s;pection, diligent per&s;ons, and lovers; eyes always running, without &s;ickne&s;s cau&s;e it, &s;hew fooli&s;hne&s;s; &s;mall and hollow eyes, the cove|tous, deceitful, and angry man; cheerful eyes betoken ju&s;t men, of plea&s;ant di&s;po&s;ition, kind and holy; twink|ling eyes, &s;hew a thief and one that lays wait to catch and en&s;nare men; blear eyes &s;ignify a whorema&s;|ter.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Eyebrows.</HI>] Upright eyebrows are amiable, but the eyebrows hanging over, &s;hew an effeminate per&s;on. The brows very hairy, denote an impediment

<P><HI>Of the No&s;e.</HI>] A great no&s;e &s;hews a good man; a little no&s;e a deceitful per&s;on. A &s;harp no&s;e denotes an angry per&s;on, and a &s;cold; thick and low, a per&s;on of bad manners. The no&s;e &s;tretching to the mouth, de|notes hone&s;ty, &s;trength, and aptne&s;s to learning. A no&s;e like an ape, betokens a libidinous and riotous per&s;on; a long crooked no&s;e, magnanimity and gener|o&s;ity.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Mouth.</HI>] A very big mouth, with the upper lip hanging over, &s;ignifies a man fooli&s;h and un&s;teady, al&s;o a ra&s;h man, a babbler, a glutton, and an ungodly man. An indifferent large mouth, &s;heweth a bold and courageous man, a warrior.</P>

<P>ISAALL next &s;ay &s;omething of Palme&s;|try, which is a judgment made of the conditions incli|nations, and fortunes of men and women, from the various lines and characters which nature has imprint|ed in the hand, which are almo&s;t as various as the hands that have them. And to render what I &s;hall &s;ay more plain, I will in the fir&s;t place pre&s;ent the &s;cheme or fig|ure of a hand, and explain the various lines therein.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>By this figure the reader will &s;ee that one of the lines, and which indeed is reckoned the principal, is called the line of life; this line inclo&s;es the thumb, &s;eparating it from the hollow of the hand. The next to it, which is called the natural line, takes its beginning from the
<PB N="60" REF="030393_0059_0FE6C48FAC0E4A30">
ri&s;ing of the fore finger, near the line of life, and reach|es to the table line, and generally makes a triangle, thus &trine;. The table line, commonly called the line of fortune, begins under the little finger, and ends near the middle finger. The girdle of <HI>Venus,</HI> which in another line &s;o called, begins near the joint of the little finger, and ends between the fore finger and the middle finger.</P>
<P>The line of death is that which plainly appears in a counter line to that of life, and by &s;ome is called the &s;i&s;ter line, ending u&s;ually at the other end; for when the line of life is ending, death comes, and it can go no farther. There are al&s;o lines in the fle&s;hy parts as in the ball of the thumb, which is called the mount of <HI>Venus;</HI> under each of the fingers are called mounts, which are each one governed by a &s;everal planet, and the hollow of the hand is called the plain of <HI>Mars.</HI> I now proceed to give judgment of the&s;e &s;everal lines. And in the fir&s;t place take notice, that in Palme&s;try the left hand is chiefly to be regarded; becau&s;e therein the lines are mo&s;t vi&s;ible, and have the &s;tricte&s;t com|munication with the heart and brains. Now having promi&s;ed the&s;e, in the next place ob&s;erve the line of life, and if it be fair, extended to its full length, and not broken with an intermixture of cro&s;s lines, it &s;hews long life and health; and it is the &s;ame if a double line of life appears, as there &s;ometimes does. When the <HI>Stars</HI> appear in this line, it is a &s;ignificator of great lo&s;&s;e&s;s and calamities: if on it there be the figure of two O's, or a Y, it threatens the per&s;on with blindne&s;s. If it wraps it&s;elf about the table line, then does it promi&s;e wealth and honor to be attained by prudence and indu&s;try; if the line be cut or rugged at the upper end, it denotes much &s;ickne&s;s. If this line be cut by any line coming from the mount of <HI>Venus,</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> declares the per&s;on to be unfortunate in love, and bu&s;ine&s;s al&s;o, and threatens him with &s;udden death.

the line of life and the table line, &s;hews the per&s;on to be very liberal and charitable, and of a noble &s;pirit. Let us now &s;ee the &s;ignification of the table line.</P>
<P>The table line, when broad, and of a lovely colour, &s;hews a healthful con&s;titution, and a quiet and con|tented mind, and courageous &s;pirit: But if it have cro&s;&s;es towards the little finger, it threatens the party with much affliction by &s;ickne&s;s. If the line be dou|ble, or divided in three parts in any of the extremi|ties, it &s;hews the party to be of a generous temper, and of a good fortune to &s;upport it; but if this line be forked at the end, it threatens the per&s;on &s;hall &s;uffer by jealou&s;ies, fears, and doubts, and with the lo&s;s of riches got by deceit. If three points &s;uch as the&s;e ... are found in it, they denote the per&s;on prudent and liberal, a lover of learning, and of a good temper. If it &s;preads it&s;elf towards the fore and middle fingers, and ends blunt, it denotes preferment. Let us now &s;ee what is &s;ignified by</P>
<P><HI>The middle Finger.</HI>] The line has in it &s;ometimes (for there is &s;carce one hand in which it varies not) divers &s;ignificant characters. Many &s;mall lines between this and the table line threatens the party with &s;ick|ne&s;s, and al&s;o gives him hopes of recovery. A half cro&s;s branching into this line, declares the per&s;on &s;hall have honor, riches, and good &s;ucce&s;s in all his under|takings. A half moon denotes cold and watery di&s;|tempers, but a &s;un or &s;tar upon this line promi&s;eth pro&s;|perity and riches. This line doubled in a woman &s;hews &s;he will have &s;everal hu&s;bands, but without any children by them.</P>
<P>The line of <HI>Venus,</HI> if it happens to be cut or divid|ed near the fore finger, threatens ruin to the party, and that it &s;hall befal him by means of a la&s;civious woman, and bad company. Two cro&s;&s;es upon this line, one being on the forefinger, and the other bend|ing
<PB N="62" REF="030393_0061_0FE6C490C7503528">
towards the little finger, &s;hews the party to be weak, and inclined to mode&s;ty and virtue; and indeed, it gen|erally denotes mode&s;ty in women; and therefore tho&s;e who de&s;ire &s;uch wives, u&s;ually choo&s;e them by this &s;tandard.</P>
<P>The liver line, if it be &s;trait and cro&s;&s;ed by other lines, &s;hews the per&s;on to be of a &s;ound judgment, and a piercing under&s;tanding; but if it be winding crooked, and bending outward, it &s;hews deceit and flattery, and that the per&s;on is not to be tru&s;ted. If it makes a tri|angle &trine;, or a quadrangle &quadrine;, it &s;hews the per&s;on to be of a noble de&s;cent, and ambitious of honour and pro|motion.</P>
<P>If it happens that this line and the middle line be|gin near each other, it denotes a per&s;on to be weak in his judgment, but if a woman, danger by hard labor.</P>
<P>The plain of <HI>Mars</HI> being in the hollow of the hand, or if the line pa&s;&s;es through it, which renders it very plain, is fortune: This plain being hollowed, and the lines be crooked and di&s;torted, threaten the party to fall by his ill conduct. When the lines begin at the wri&s;t, long within the plain, reaching the brawn of the hand, they &s;hew the per&s;on to be one given to quarreling, often in broils, and of a hot and fiery &s;pirit, by which he &s;hall &s;uffer much damage. If deep large cro&s;&s;es in the middle of the plain, it &s;hews the party &s;hall obtain honor by martial exploits; but if it be a woman, that &s;he &s;hall have &s;everal hu&s;bands, and ea&s;y labour with her children.</P>
<P>The line of death is fatal, when any cro&s;&s;es or broken lines appear in it; for they threaten the per&s;on with &s;ickne&s;s and a &s;hort life. A clouded moon appearing therein, threatens a child bed woman with death. A bloody &s;pot in the line, denotes a violent death. A &s;tar like a comet threatens ruin by war, and death by pe&s;|tilence; but if a bright &s;un appear therein, it promi&s;es long life and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="030393_0062_0FE6C4D81949A9D0">As for the lines in the wri&s;t being fair, they denote good fortune; but if cro&s;&s;ed and broken, the contrary.</P>
<P>Thus much with re&s;pect to the &s;everal lines in the hand. Now as to the judgment to be made from the hand it&s;elf: If the hand be &s;oft and long, and lean withal, it denotes the per&s;on of a good under&s;tanding, a lover of peace and hone&s;ty, di&s;creet, &s;erviceable, a good neighbour, and a lover of learning. He who&s;e hands are very thick and very &s;hort, is thereby &s;ignifi|ed to be faithful, &s;trong and laborious, and one that cannot long retain his anger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; He who&s;e hands are full of hairs, and tho&s;e hairs thick; and great ones, and his fingers withal crooked, he is thereby noted to be lux|urious, vain, fal&s;e, of a dull under&s;tanding and di&s;po|&s;ition, and more fooli&s;h than wi&s;e. He who&s;e hands and fingers do bend upwards, is commonly a liberal man, &s;erviceable, a keeper of &s;ecrecy, and apt (to be poor for he is &s;eldom fortunate) to do any man cour|te&s;y. He who&s;e hand is &s;tiff and will not bend at the upper joint near his finger, is always a wretched mi&s;er|able per&s;on, covetous, ob&s;tinate, incredulous, and one that will believe nothing that contradicts his own pri|vate intere&s;t. And thus much &s;hall &s;uffice to be &s;aid of judgment made by Palme&s;try.</P>

<P>The a&s;tronomical year is two fold, that is <HI>Solar</HI> and <HI>Lunar.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;olar year is the time in which the &s;un, by his proper motion, departing from one point of the eclip|tic,
<PB N="70" REF="030393_0069_0FE6C49B14731798">
returns to the &s;ame again. And there is called either natural or &s;yderical.</P>
<P N="1">1. The natural or tropical year, is the &s;pace of time in which the &s;un is departing out of the tropical, equi|noctial, or &s;ol&s;titial point, and returning through the ecliptic, returneth to the &s;ame again.</P>
<P>This natural, or tropical year, contains 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, 15 &s;econds.</P>
<P>The true and unequal tropical year, is &s;ometimes more, and &s;ometimes le&s;s than the equal, by 6 or 7 min|utes; &s;o it increa&s;eth, or decrea&s;eth, according to the &s;wift or &s;low progre&s;s of the equinoctial or &s;ol&s;titial points.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;yderial year is the &s;pace of time in which the &s;un returns to the &s;ame &s;tar, from whence he de|parted; and is 365 days, 6 hours, 6 minutes, but in the &s;econds there is a difference among authors.</P>
<P>Now the lunar year is likewi&s;e two fold; the com|mon, which is 12 moons, or 354 days, 8 hours, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The embilli&s;mal, which is 13 moons or lunations, containing 383 days, 21 hours, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The political and civil years, are &s;uch as are com|monly u&s;ed for the di&s;tinction of times, wherein re&s;pect had either to the motion of the &s;un or moon only, or to them both together, according to the cu&s;tom of di|vers nations.</P>
<P>The <HI>Julian</HI> or old <HI>Roman</HI> year, con&s;i&s;ted of 365 days and 6 hours; this <HI>Julian</HI> account, or year, is u&s;ed by the <HI>Engli&s;h, Mu&s;covites, Syrians, Aba&s;&s;enees</HI> and <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> though the names of the months differ. It is held to begin (with the vulgar) on the 1&s;t of Jan|uary, which is therefore called New Year's Day; but according to the &s;tate accounts, the year begins not till the year; as for example: The fir&s;t day of Janu|ary next will be reckoned the fir&s;t day of the year 1797. But becau&s;e the &s;tate fir&s;t account begins not till the 25th of March they commonly write the date double, thus 1719&mdash;20 from the 1&s;t of January till the 25th of March, after which they write only 1720.</P>
<P>The Gregorian, or new Roman year, is &s;o called, becau&s;e mended by <HI>Pope Gregory</HI> XIII. con&s;i&s;ts of 365 days, 5 hours, 40 minutes and 12 &s;econds&punc; It begins

But the true or apparent, is according to the true motion of the &s;un through the Zodiac; for when he is in, or near his apogaeon, the months are longer, but when he is in, or near his perigaeon, they are &s;horter. Lunar months are referred to the moon's motion, and are chiefly three fold, viz.&mdash;Fir&s;t, periodical, which is the &s;pace of time in which the moon, by her motion, goes through the Zodiac, and is about 27 days, 8 hours; &s;econdly, &s;ynodical, which is the &s;pace of time from one con|junction to another, being performed according to the moon's mean motion, in 29 days, 22 hours, 44 minutes, and about 4 &s;econds: But according to the moon's true motion, it is &s;ometimes greater or le&s;&s;er, by about 12 hours.&mdash;Thirdly, the month of illumination, or ap|parition, is &s;aid to be 28 days, or four weeks, it being the longe&s;t time that the moon is to be &s;een between the change and change: La&s;tly, the political months are evil and u&s;ual: As every nation be&s;t plea&s;e; which differ both in proportion and name.</P>

<P><PB N="81" REF="030393_0080_0FE6C4E0E23B0FC0">As to the &s;ea&s;on of ploughing, it mu&s;t be chiefly in the &s;pring, the ground being in the &s;ummer too hard, and in the winter too dirty; but in the &s;pring, the ground being mellowed, is the more ea&s;y to be wrought upon; and the weeds are then turned in, and being plucked up by the roots before they are &s;eeded, will not &s;pring again, but help to enrich the ground, And therefore the middle of March is u&s;ually the be&s;t time to begin ploughing. But yet if the ground be light and &s;andy, it may be ploughed in the winter, if the weath|er will permit. A &s;lender and level ground, &s;ubject to water, &s;hould be ploughed in the end of Augu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and &s;tirred again in September, and prepared for &s;owing a|bout the middle of March. The light hilly ground is broke up about the middle of September, for if it be broken up before, it may be burnt up by the &s;un, and have no goodne&s;s remaining in it, being barren and without juice. But this &s;hall &s;uffice to be &s;poken of breaking up the ground.</P>
<P>Now if your ground be barren and cold, producing &s;tore of weeds or ru&s;hes, or to bring it to a moderate heat, and &s;o make fruitful, let it be manured with lime. The lime&s;tones may be had among quarries of &s;tones, and in divers other places, and you may burn them in a kiln, in the mo&s;t convenient place you have to &s;ave the carriage; and when you have &s;anded your ground and hacked it, make your lime &s;mall, and on every a|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re be&s;tow thirty or forty bu&s;hels of lime, &s;preading it, and mixing it well with earth and &s;and; and the &s;trong|er and &s;harper the lime is, the better the earth will be, and you will find your improvement an&s;wer your labor. <HI>And here note,</HI> that it is no matter what color your lime &s;tones are, whether white or grey, &s;o that they be but &s;harp and &s;trong in quality to give a good tincture to the earth, it being the &s;trength and goodne&s;s of the lime, and not its beauty, that produces the profit. It is a greater help to a cold, clayey wet ground; &s;uch grounds are al&s;o very much helped by laying dung, or
<PB N="82" REF="030393_0081_0FE6C523860BB2F0">
any &s;oil that is fattening, either of cattle, or &s;uch as is ca&s;t out of pond lakes, or muddy ditches, for bar|ren and hot earth can never be overlaid with good ma|nure and compo&s;t, for that warms the earth, and it is the want of warmth makes it unfruitful.</P>
<P>As for the hacking and &s;anding before mentioned, the fir&s;t is, after the ground has been turned up with the plough, to go over it with a long hoe, or hack, and cut in pieces the gra&s;s which you &s;ee turned up with ridges or furrows, or any uneven lumps, that it may be dragged away, burnt, or carried together with the weeds, not to grow up again, to incumber the corn. And landing it, to bring loads of &s;and, and lay them in convenient places, &s;preading them lightly, or thick (as you &s;ee occa&s;ion) over the ground, that the lime mixing with it, may the better embody with the mould, and produce a good crop.</P>
<P>But be&s;ide what I have already mentioned, there are &s;everal other ways of manuring land: I will mention &s;ome of them, for the hu&s;bandman's better informa|tion. But here it will not be ami&s;s to take notice, that what will do very well for one &s;ort of land, will not do at all for another; and therefore in manuring of land, regard mu&s;t be had to the nature of it: As for example; for a clayey ground, lime and &s;and is ex|cellent to manure it with, but for a barren &s;andy ground, good marle is much more proper. If it be a&s;ked, <HI>What this marle is?</HI> I an&s;wer, it is a rich cliff clay, an enemy to all weeds that &s;pring up of them|&s;elves, and gives a generative virtue to all &s;eeds that are &s;own in the ground. It is of a glewy &s;ub&s;tance, in quality cold and dry, and was earth before ti was marle, it is nothing but a rich clay of divers colours, according to the &s;trength of the &s;un and climate where it is produced. This is &s;o good a manure, that well laid on, it will enrich the barrene&s;t ground for ten years, and &s;ome for thirty. To find it, take an auger whimble, made to hold many bits, one longer than an|other,
<PB N="83" REF="030393_0082_0FE6C5110AA78A00">
till you have tried, by drawing the earth into one place, then proceed in the mo&s;t proper places till you come to the marle, and the propere&s;t places are in the lowe&s;t parts of high countries, near the brooks and lakes, and in the high parts of low countries, upon the knolls or little hills, and in the clefts of &s;teep banks, or branches in hills opening them&s;elves; in &s;ome pla|ces it lies deep, in others &s;hallow; and commonly barrenly &s;andy grounds are verged with it, lying very deep. Having found it, dig it up in great lumps, and lay it in heaps a yard di&s;tance one from another, and when it is dried, &s;pread all the heaps.&mdash;Many mix the marle with the &s;and; but becau&s;e this is not &s;o ea&s;y to come at, I will &s;peak of others more general, that will enrich any poor &s;and or city for grain, with le&s;s trouble and co&s;t than before.</P>
<P>Woolen rags are very profitable for manuring and enriching of land, a &s;ackful and half being &s;ufficient for dre&s;&s;ing an acre of arable ground. The way of u&s;ing them is to chop them very &s;mall, and &s;pread them an equal thickne&s;s over the land before the fol|lowing time, and then coming to fallow, let the plough take them carefully into the ground, and cover them.</P>
<P>Shavings, or wa&s;te horns, or hoofs of bea&s;ts, are very good to manure land withal; &s;catter the &s;havings in the &s;ame manner, and plough them in after heat. The&s;e will keep the ground in like quality as the rags, for five years together, without any renewing. The hoofs of cattle are approved of for this, and may be had of trotter and tripe men, &amp;c. and mu&s;t be u&s;ed as the rags and &s;havings. Soap a&s;hes, when the lye has been drained from them, is of excellent u&s;e in this ca&s;e, and has be&s;ides the property of killing weeds and in&s;ects that breed in the ground, and eat up the corn. The hair of bea&s;ts enriches land, being &s;trewed and plough|ed in, and there let it lie to rot. Al&s;o malt du&s;t is much available to this purpo&s;e, allowing three quarts of it to an acre. And to enrich your dung or lay&s;tall, is to
<PB N="84" REF="030393_0083_0FE64B738E6420B8">
throw often beef broth, and other wa&s;te broths upon it, as al&s;o &s;oap &s;uds; and in &s;o doing one load will be worth three of the &s;ame kind that is not &s;o u&s;ed. But this &s;hall &s;uffice as to manuring of ground.</P>
<P>In &s;owing of your &s;eed, let your grain be the be&s;t, and &s;catter it according to the art of good hu&s;bandry, and let your &s;prinkling be a medium, not too much, nor too little. But to make the &s;eed pro&s;per the bet|ter, &s;teep it in thick &s;limy water, that drains from dunghills, and if no &s;uch is to be had near at hand, &s;teep cow dung in water, and &s;oak the &s;eed in it; wheat will be well &s;oaked in 18 hours; barley in 36; peas in 12; but rye and oats may be &s;owed dry, for that agrees be&s;t with them.</P>
<P>But when the &s;eed is &s;own, all is not done; you mu&s;t take care to prevent the de&s;igns of tho&s;e that will make void all your labour, and defeat your hopes, or el&s;e, though you have &s;own your corn, you &s;hall never &s;ee it come up; rooks, crows and daws, are great devourers of grain, who will be &s;ure to be about you when you go to &s;ow; to keep the&s;e at a di&s;tance, &s;hoot &s;ome of them, and hang them upon poles in divers angles of your field; &s;tick their feathers along the ridges of the land; lay trains of gunpowder and blow the powder up, or let it lie &s;cattered in the mo&s;t frequented places, and the &s;cent of it will make them for&s;ake the field, e&s;pecially now and then &s;hooting a little; you may al&s;o take great numbers of them by placing &s;trong thick brown paper, twi&s;ted taper wi&s;e, like tho&s;e on &s;ugar loaves, in holes of the earth, the broad top coming even with the ground, bird lime the in&s;ide, and &s;catter &s;ome grain in it, and then the fowl putting in his head to take it out, the paper &s;o limed will &s;tick clo&s;e, and ri&s;e with him, when being blindfolded, in amaze he will fly up a great height, and will fall down again, &s;o that if you be near at hand, he may ea&s;ily be taken.

Con&s;ider in the next place, what kind of gra&s;s it naturally produces, whether clear and entire, or mix<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> with that of wor&s;e growth, the fir&s;t is be&s;t; but if it be of a wor&s;e &s;ort, intermixed with thi&s;tles, broom and offen&s;ive weeds, then grub and pluck them by the roots, clearing the ground of them as well as you can, then dry them, mix them with &s;traw, and burn them upon the &s;warth of the ground, and &s;pread the a&s;hes upon it, then fold your &s;heep upon the ground for &s;everel nights, that their dung may increa&s;e its &s;trength, and their feet trample up the gra&s;s; then &s;catter it well over with hay &s;eeds, and go over them with a roller, or beat them with a flat &s;hovel, that they may be pre&s;&s;ed into the ground to take root; then over the&s;e &s;catter hay, or the rooting of hay under &s;tacks, or the &s;weeping of the barns, or moi&s;t bottoms of any hay that has been good, and is moi&s;t, and of no other u&s;e, then &s;pread on your manure, as hor&s;e dung, man's odure, or the dung of any bea&s;t, which being thinned, and the clods well broken, let it lie till the new gra&s;s &s;pring through it; but do not graze it the fir&s;t year, le&s;t the cattle tread it up, not having yet taken very good root, but mow it that it may have time to come to perfection; and though the fir&s;t year it may prove &s;hort and coar&s;e, yet the &s;econd it will be fine and very long, and in great plenty.
