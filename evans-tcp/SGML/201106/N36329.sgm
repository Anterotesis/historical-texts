<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO inculcate the principles of virtue and morality, in the young and ri&s;|ing generation, is, no doubt, an object of the greate&s;t importance: and to effect this purpo&s;e, is the chief inducement with the compiler of this &s;mall volume, for in|truding it on the public.</P>
<P>From the compilation of a youth, peo|ple arrived at maturity can expect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tle novelty or improvement; but as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">o|bable that mo&s;t of the readers, who &s;hall peru&s;e this volume, will be little more advanced in life than him&s;elf, he hopes it may contribute both to their entertain|ment and in&s;truction.</P>
<P>Should this be the ca&s;e a which from the opinion of &s;everal judicious friends, to whom he has &s;ubmitted the manu&s;cript, it will, it may prove as an incitement to his proceeding in &s;ome other undertaking, which, as he advances further in life, he tru&s;ts, may prove more conducive to public utility: to promote which, he knows to be the duty of every good cit|izen.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="047474_0003_1023B1A0C5A74018">It would be ungrateful on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to omit returning thanks, to his many friends, who have patronized him with their &s;ub&s;criptions; and happy &s;hall he be, if upon peru&s;al, it is found to an&s;wer their expectations.</P>

<HEAD>ON DEVOTION.</HEAD>
<P>DEVOTION, con&s;idered &s;imply in it&s;elf, is an intercour&s;e betwixt God and us; betwixt the Supreme, &s;elf-exi&s;tent, inconceivable Spirit, which formed and pre&s;erves the univer&s;e; and that par|ticular &s;pirit, with which, for awful rea&s;ons, he has animated a portion of matter upon earth that we call man. It is a &s;ilent act in which the &s;oul di|ve&s;ts it&s;elf of outward things, flies into heaven, and pours forth all its wants, wi&s;hes, hopes, fears, guilt or plea&s;ures, into the bo&s;om of an Almighty Friend. Though this devotion, in its fir&s;t &s;tages, may be a weari&s;ome and in&s;ipid exerci&s;e; yet this ari&s;es mere|ly from the depravity of nature and our pa&s;&s;ions. A little habit will overcome the reluctance when you have fairly entered upon your journey; the ways of this wi&s;dom will be ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all its paths peace. True devotion, doubtle&s;s requires a con&s;iderable degree of ab&s;traction from the world: hence modern chri&s;tians treat it as a vi|&s;ion; hence many modern writers have little of its
<PB N="6" REF="047474_0005_1023B1A2581D4B48">
unction; but it glows in the &s;criptures, it warms us in the fathers, it burned in an Au&s;tin, and in ma|ny others of the per&s;ecuted martyrs who are now with God. That we have little of it, is not won|derful; it makes no noi&s;e in the circle of the learn|ed, or of the elegant under a heap of worldly cares: we &s;mother the lovely infant and will not let it breathe.</P>
<P>Vanity, ambition, plea&s;ure, avarice, quench the cele&s;tial fire: and the&s;e, alas, are too much the gods of mortals ever &s;ince the world began! Wri|ters have been amu&s;ing us only with &s;hadows of this piety, in&s;tead of giving us its &s;oul and &s;ub&s;tance. Super&s;tition has placed it in opinion, ceremonies, au&s;terities, pilgrimages, per&s;ecutions, an augu&s;t temple or &s;plendid imagery, which has little con|nection with &s;entiment or &s;pirit. Enthu&s;ia&s;m has &s;welled with unnatural conceptions, and obtruded a &s;purious offspring upon the world in&s;tead of the engaging child of rea&s;on and truth; whil&s;t the luke|warm and indifferent, have re&s;ted in a few outward duties which have had no vigor: and as they &s;pring not from the heart, never entered the temple of the Mo&s;t High.</P>
<P>Real piety is of a very different, and of a much more animated nature; it looks up to God, &s;ees, hears, and feels him in every event, in every vi|ci&s;&s;itude, in all places, in all &s;ea&s;ons and upon all occa&s;ions; it is theory vivified by experience, it is faith &s;ub&s;tantiated by mental enjoyment; it is heaven tran&s;planted in the human bo&s;om; it is the radiance of the Divinity, warming and encircling man; it is a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e gratfiied by &s;piritual &s;en&s;ations: without this, all ceremonies are inefficacious; books, prayers, &s;acraments and meditations, are but a bo|dy without a &s;oul, or a &s;tatue without animation.
<PB N="7" REF="047474_0006_1023B1668E312DC0">
That man is capable of having &s;uch an intercour&s;e with his Maker, there are many living witne&s;&s;es to prove, without having recour&s;e to the vi&s;ions of fanatics, or the dreams of enthu&s;ia&s;ts. It may be proved to &s;pring from natural and philo&s;ophical cau&s;es; God is a &s;pirit, &s;o is the mind. Bodies can have intercour&s;e, &s;o can &s;ouls: when minds are in an a&s;&s;imulating &s;tate of purity, they are in union with their Maker. This was the bli&s;s of Paradi&s;e; &s;in interrupted, and holine&s;s mu&s;t re&s;tore it to a &s;oul thus di&s;po&s;ed. The Creator communicates him&s;elf in a manner which is as in&s;en&s;ible to the natural eye, as the falling of the dews; but not le&s;s refre&s;hing to its &s;ecret powers, than that is to vegetation. The primitive &s;aints are de&s;cribing this when they &s;peak of their tran&s;ports. David felt it when he longed for God. <HI>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks.</HI> Paul, when he gloried in his tribulations, it was embodied in him when he was carried up into the Third heaven and heard <HI>things impo&s;&s;ible to be utter|ed.</HI> Stephen was filled with it, when he &s;aw the <HI>Heavens opened, and prayed for his murderers.</HI> By it, martyrs were &s;upported when they were &s;toned and &s;awed a&s;under: and till we feel it in our&s;elves, we &s;hall never fully know how gracious the Lord is. If you can acquire this &s;piritual ab&s;traction, you will at once have made your fortune for eternity; it will be of little moment what is your lot on earth, or what the di&s;tingui&s;hing vici&s;&s;itudes of your life; pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity, health or &s;ickne&s;s, honor or di&s;grace; a cottage or a crown will all be &s;o ma|ny in&s;truments of glory: the whole creation will become a temple; every event and every object lead your mind to God. And in his greatne&s;s and perfection you will in&s;en&s;ibly lo&s;e the littlene&s;s, the glare and tin&s;el of all human things. If I wi&s;h on|ly

to &s;et off your per&s;ons to the greate&s;t advantage, I would recommend this true &s;ublime religion; it gives a plea&s;ing &s;erenity to the countenance, and a chearfulne&s;s to the &s;pirits, beyond the reach of art or the power of affectation. It communicates a real tran&s;port to the mind, which di&s;&s;ipation mimicks for a moment, a &s;weetne&s;s to the di&s;po&s;ition and lu&s;tre to the manners, which all the airs of modern polite|ne&s;s &s;tudy but in vain.</P>

<HEAD>POOR JOSEPH.</HEAD>
<P>A POOR half-witted man, named Jo&s;eph, who&s;e employ was to go on errands, and carry par|cels, pa&s;&s;ing through London &s;treets one day, heard p&s;alm-&s;inging in a place of wor&s;hip; he went into it, having a large parcel of yarn hanging over his &s;houlders: it was Dr. Calamy's meeting-hou&s;e, St. Mary's, Aldermanbury.

&s;urrounded the Doctor. He read the text in 1&s;t Tim. I. 15. "This is a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, of whom I am chief." From this he preached in the cleare&s;t and &s;imple&s;t manner, the ancient apo&s;tolic go&s;pel, the contents of this faithful &s;aying, <HI>viz.</HI> that there is &s;alvation for the vile&s;t &s;inners, &s;olely through the worthine&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the God who made all things. "Not many rich, not many noble, are called by this doc|trine (&s;aith the apo&s;tle) but God hath cho&s;en the weak things of this world to confound the things that are mighty." While the elegant a&s;&s;embly li&s;t|le&s;&s;ly heard this doctrine, and if they were &s;truck with any thing at all, it was only with &s;ome brilliant expre&s;&s;ion or well turned period that dropped from the Doctor. Jo&s;eph, in rags, gazing with a&s;ton|i&s;hment, never took his eyes from the preacher, but drank in with eagerne&s;s all he &s;aid: and trudging homeward, was heard thus muttering to him&s;elf; "Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the God who made all things, came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, like Jo&s;eph; and this is true; and it is a "faithful &s;aying." Not long after this, Jo&s;eph was &s;eized with a fever and was dangerou&s;ly ill. As he to&s;&s;ed upon his bed, his con&s;tant language was, "Jo&s;eph is the chief of &s;in|ners; but Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, and Jo&s;eph loves him for this." His neigh|bors who came to &s;ee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wondered at hear|ing him always dwelling on this. Some of the religious &s;ort addre&s;&s;ed him in the following man|ner:&mdash;But what &s;ay you of your own heart, Jo|&s;eph? is there no token for good about it? no &s;ay|ing change there? Have you clo&s;ed with Chri&s;t, by acting faith upon him? "Ah! no (&s;ays he) Jo&s;eph can act nothing; Jo&s;eph has nothing to &s;ay for him|&s;elf,

but ju&s;t that he is chief of &s;inners; yet &s;eeing it is a faithful &s;aying, that Je&s;us, he who made all things, came into the world to &s;ave &s;in|ners, why may not Jo&s;eph, after all, be &s;av|ed?" One man finding out where he heard this doctrine, on which he dwelt &s;o uniformly, and with &s;uch delight, went and a&s;ked Doctor Calamy to come and vi&s;it him. He came; but Jo&s;eph was now very weak, and had not &s;poken for &s;ome time, and though told of the Doctor's arrival, he took no no|tice of him; but when the Doctor began to &s;peak to to him, as &s;oon as he heard the &s;ound of his voice, he in&s;tantly &s;prang up on his elbows, and &s;eizing him by the hands, exclaimed as loud as he could, with his now feeble and trembling voice, "O Sir, you are the friend of the Lord Je&s;us, who I heard &s;peak &s;o well of him, and whom I love for what you &s;aid of him. Jo&s;eph is the chief of &s;inners; but it is a faithful &s;aying, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the God who made all things, came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, and why not Jo&s;eph? O pray to that Je|&s;us for me, pray that he may &s;ave me: tell him that Jo&s;eph thinks he loves him, for coming into the world to &s;ave &s;uch &s;inners as Jo&s;eph." The Doctor prayed. When he concluded, Jo&s;eph thanke him more kindly: he then put his hand under the pillow and took out an old rag, in which were tied up five guineas; and putting it into the Doctor's hand, (which he had kept all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> time clo&s;e in his) he thus addre&s;&s;ed him, "Jo&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n his folly, had laid up this to keep him in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d age: but Jo&s;eph will ne|ver &s;ee old age; take it, and divide it among&s;t the poor friends of the Lord Je&s;us, and tell them that Jo&s;eph gave it them for his &s;ake who came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, "of whom he is chief."

<P>THE &s;hades of the evening had begun to &s;pread their dimming gloom over the plains, when Palemon, who, with his &s;on Thir&s;is, had ju&s;t fold|ed their flock, &s;lowly returning to their peaceful dwelling. Palemon had long been an inhabitant of the&s;e uplands. His head was &s;ilvered over with age. Thir&s;is had ju&s;t reached that a&s;cending period of life which verges on manhood. A lively filial re&s;pect was implanted in his brea&s;t towards the venerable author of his being. He looked up to him, not on|ly for &s;upport, but for that advice, by which he was to guide his &s;teps through the thorny roads of life. Every admonition that fell from his father's lips, he trea&s;ured up in his mind, and noted every precept on the tablet of his heart.</P>
<P>Slowly returned they towards their home; for time had now abated the vigor of the parent.

<HEAD>THE HERMIT:&mdash;A FABLE.</HEAD>
<P>A CERTAIN Hermit had &s;cooped his cave near the &s;ummit of a lofty mountain, from whence he had an opportunity of &s;urveying a large extent both of &s;ea and land.

The woods were dre&s;&s;ed in the brighte&s;t verdure; the thickets adorned with the gaye&s;t blo&s;&s;oms.

<L>YOU little know the heart that you advi&s;e,</L>

<L>Not hearing cen&s;ure, nor affecting prai&s;e.</L>
