<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER mature deliberation on the pre&s;byterian prote&s;tant principles, and Mr. Oliver's &s;trong attachment to the &s;ame, binding his adherents to them all the days of their lives, have influenced the author to &s;ome degree of &s;earch, to &s;ee if the&s;e things are &s;o: and I profe&s;s to believe, that there are many illu&s;trat|ed truths in that compo&s;ition, called the pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith: and I profe&s;s to believe, that there are &s;ome great errors held forth in &s;aid compo&s;ition: and if the truths therein contained might be received without that mixture of error, I had held my peace; but that not being the ca&s;e, although I have neither natural or acquired abilities &s;ufficient to compo&s;e a piece fit for the pre&s;s, yet nece&s;&s;ity con&s;trains, yea, overpowers all objections that lie in the way; for who, with their eyes but half open, would not have their &s;pirits moved, when they behold the learned &s;uper&s;ti|tious bigots leading their fellow mortals in an old crook|ed path? mean time recommending it to be the be&s;t &s;traight, yea, mo&s;t perfect and only path that ever mortals traveled in, that ever arrived to the heavenly country.</P>
<P>The &s;acred writings give an account of &s;ome wild gourds, &s;heared in a pot of pottage; but before they eat, it was di&s;covered: and one cries out, "O thou man of God! there is death in the pot;" con&s;equently would not eat till the danger was removed. And did not the compilers of the pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith (although it appears to me more than probable that many of them were pious godly men) gather wild gourds of error and &s;hear them in with the word of truth? And what man of God &s;hall we cry to re&s;pect|ing
<PB N="4" REF="035671_0003_1006951663364070">this death being in the pot? For although the pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters may be called men of God, as above, yet it is tho&s;e very mini&s;ters that have gathered the&s;e wild gourds of error, and &s;heared them in with the word of truth, and dealing it out for their adher|ents to eat: But if we (after being alarmed of this wild gourd of error) will &s;it down calmly and eat of this mixt pottage, yea, &s;wear agreeably to the pre&s;byterian oath (by the great name of the Lord) that we will eat no other pottage all the days of our lives, we may then fear there will be neither prophet nor meat to heal this deadly poi&s;on: For it is dangerous &s;hutting our eyes again&s;t light, le&s;t God in his righteous judgment clo&s;e our eyes; le&s;t we &s;hould &s;ee light or come to the knowledge of the truth: and as I am attempting to ca&s;t in my mite into the trea&s;ury of truth, in oppo&s;ition to error, would readily acknowledge my inability either natural or acquired, and feel my&s;elf greatly embarra&s;&s;ed even in expre&s;&s;ing my own ideas; but as a &s;tammer|ing child can neither &s;peak grammatical or &s;y&s;tematic|al, yet a tender father receiving the broken ideas of his child, overlooks all tho&s;e imperfections of language; &s;o in like manner, I a&s;k all, but in a &s;pecial manner the learned, to overlook all tho&s;e imperfections that may appear in my manner of procedure: and when my attempts to arrange or illu&s;trate ideas &s;y&s;tematical|ly &s;hall fail, then look in a &s;pecial manner to the ideas &s;ugge&s;ted. Was I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of abilities adequate to the work which I have undertook, I might have conveyed my ideas in as plain but &s;moother manner, which would be more agreeable to corrupt nature to receive: but if any &s;hould think that I am too pointed with my charges again&s;t the pre&s;byterian principles or Mr. Oli|ver, as their advocate: To &s;uch I would &s;ay, that in Paul's epi&s;tle to Titus, the apo&s;tle informs Titus of &s;ome characters who&s;e mouth mu&s;t be &s;topped, becau&s;e they had teached things that they ought not. Where|fore, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, 'rebuke them &s;harply:' From
<PB N="5" REF="035671_0004_10069517FA9B18F8">which we may infer, that when any erroneous doctrine is &s;et up and boldly advocated, by &s;wearing to &s;upport and defend it, all the days of their lives, that &s;uch a de|gree of pointed &s;harpne&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary, as the nature of the error and boldne&s;s of its advocates require; and in my judgment I have not exceeded the bounds that the nature of the ca&s;e requires: but of this, every one will judge according to the light in which they view things in: but if the matter is true, I tru&s;t that it will not be rejected for its plainne&s;s. King David was not offend|ed becau&s;e of the plainne&s;s of the prophet, when he &s;aid 'thou art the man:' but the Scribes and Phari|&s;ees was &s;o offended when Chri&s;t told them plain truth, that they rejected Chri&s;t, truth and all, and wilfully &s;hut their eyes again&s;t light; for which, God, in his righteous judgments, clo&s;ed their eyes, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;ee light.</P>
<P>But without any further introductory remarks or a|pologies, I &s;hall proceed to point out &s;ome of tho&s;e er|rors contained in the prote&s;tant pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THE twenty-third chapter of the confe&s;&s;ion of faith &s;aith, <Q>That the civil magi&s;trate hath authority, and it is his duty, to take order, that unity and peace be pre&s;erved in the church, that the truth of God be kept pure and entire, that all bla&s;phemies and here|&s;ies be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, all corruptions and abu&s;es in wor|&s;hip and di&s;cipline prevented or reformed; and all the ordinances of God duly &s;ettled, admini&s;tered, and ob&s;erved. For the better effecting whereof, he hath power to call Synods, to be pre&s;ent at them, and to provide that what&s;oever is tran&s;acted in them be according to the mind of God:</Q></P>
<P>Now the fir&s;t great query is, whether this power which the pre&s;byterian prote&s;tant acknowledges the magi&s;trate to be cloathed with, is of God or of men? I pre&s;ume it is of men; and the practice of the churches at large all declare it to be of men. More|over,
<PB N="6" REF="035671_0005_1006951B4BC13378">Chri&s;t, the great Head and King of his church, commi&s;&s;ioned his apo&s;tles re&s;pecting the government of his church; and withal warns them of the per&s;ecu|tions they would meet with; and tells them, they &s;hould be brought before kings and rulers for his name &s;ake: but if Chri&s;t commi&s;&s;ioned kings or magi&s;trates accord|ing to the pre&s;byterian prote&s;tant religion, (declared in the afore&s;aid twenty-third chapter of the pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith, to call Synods and in&s;pect them, and to approve or di&s;approve, according as the magi&s;|trate found agreeable or di&s;agreeable to the word of God) from whence then would the per&s;ecution ari&s;e? Would a king per&s;ecute him&s;elf, or any acting by his authority, at his call, under his in&s;pection and con|trol? But the re&s;ult of this que&s;tion may be an&s;wered by the defence that Chri&s;t made when the Scribes and Phari&s;ees accu&s;ed him with ca&s;ting out devils through belzebub the prince of the devils. Chri&s;t confuted them by &s;howing them that if &s;atan was divided again&s;t him&s;elf his kingdom could not &s;tand. Con&s;equently if the civil magi&s;trate is cloathed with &s;uch eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal authority as the pre&s;byterians &s;ay he is, then it fol|lows, that if kings and rulers per&s;ecute the church, as Chri&s;t &s;aid they would, they are divided again&s;t them|&s;elves; con&s;equently could not &s;tand.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The &s;econd article in the thirty-fir&s;t chapter of the afore&s;aid confe&s;&s;ion of faith (relative to the power of the civil magi&s;trate calling Synods) is explained by the declaration of the a&s;&s;embly at Edenburgh, Augu&s;t twenty-&s;eventh, &s;ixteen hundred forty-&s;even, Se&s;&s;ion twenty-third; and the explanation &s;aith, <Q>In point of government, that although in un&s;ettled churches a Synod of mini&s;ters may be called by the magi&s;trate's authority and nomination, without any other call to con&s;ult</Q> &amp;c. and further &s;aith, <Q>that although min|i&s;ters may of them&s;elves meet &s;ynodically in churches not con&s;tituted, yet neither of the&s;e ought to be done in churches con&s;tituted and &s;ettled: it being
<PB N="7" REF="035671_0006_1006951EB9B67D88" MS="y">(&s;ay they) always free for the magi&s;trate to advi&s;e with Synods of mini&s;ters ordinarily, or being indict|ed by his authority; meantime they &s;ay that if the magi&s;trate withhold his con&s;ent, it is free to meet &s;ynodically from intrin&s;ical power received from Chri&s;t, provided neverthele&s;s, that the mini&s;ters fir&s;t make the nece&s;&s;ity of meeting known to the mag|i&s;trate by remon&s;trance and humble &s;upplication.</Q></P>
<P>This explanatory declaration appears calculated to blend the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical power into one com|pound body; but rather gives the magi&s;trate the pre|eminence in eccle&s;ia&s;tical things: but as Nebuchad|nezzar's image was partly of iron and partly of clay, they would not mix together. So Chri&s;t being a &s;pir|itual King, having a &s;piritual kindgom, his laws for the government of his church will not mix with the temporal laws of civil government; and the officers appointed for each government are as di&s;tinct as the laws; con&s;equently the officers of Chri&s;t's church are not by virtue of their office to interfere with tho&s;e things that concerns the civil magi&s;trate, neither may the civil magi&s;trate (by virtue of his office in the civil department) interfere upon the office of a ruler in Chri&s;t's church; but each one according to their &s;eve|ral &s;tations, whether in church or &s;tate in &s;ubjection to each other in the lawful execution of their &s;everal offi|ces, rendering to Cae&s;ar the things that are Cae&s;ar's, and to God the things that are God's.</P>
<P>Objection. There is nothing contained in the afore|&s;aid chapters (relative to the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical power being blended together) but what is agreeably to the example of Godly kings under the law.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. There was many ways taken by the mag|i&s;trate under the law to inforce true religion, has no authority under the go&s;pel. And why &s;hould we &s;hut our eyes again&s;t the more clear light of the go&s;|pel, and &s;eek for light in the more dark di&s;pen&s;ations of the law? When the prophets under the law, beheld
<PB N="8" REF="035671_0007_10069522457A4860">the coming of Chri&s;t, they &s;pake of him as a great light, in a &s;pecial manner to the Gentile world: and as this great light has come and committed the keys of his kingdom, and the government of his church to his mini&s;ters; promi&s;ing to be with them to the end of the world. And as this great light continues to &s;hine in the go&s;pel with great con&s;picuity, for a guide to the churches feet, and a lamp to her path, how injuri|ous mu&s;t it then be to the great lawgiver, to traffick away &s;ome of the laws of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e to purcha&s;e the &s;trength of civil government in the church? But as it was with Jeroboam in the beginning of his reign, &s;o it was with the pre&s;byterians in the beginning of their pre&s;byterian reign. I &s;hall attempt in &s;ome in&s;tances to draw the parallel.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, Jeroboam with the ten tribes was not wil|ling to &s;ubject them&s;elves to the burden of Rehobo|am's little finger, being thicker than his father's loins, which induced the ten tribes to revolt. So in like manner the pre&s;byterians were not willing to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the burden of the liturgy rights and cer|imonies of the church, which induced them to revolt, and frame a new code of pre&s;byterian laws.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Jeroboam was jealous of the weakne&s;s of his kingdom, unle&s;s he would prevent the people from go|ing to Jeru&s;alem to wor&s;hip. Con&s;equently he &s;et up golden calves in Dan and Bethel, which became a &s;in. So in like manner the pre&s;byterians were jealous of their weakne&s;s in their revolution; unle&s;s they could frame a code of laws by which the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical government would (in many re&s;pects) be cemented to|gether into one compound power, which being affec|tually done, became a great &s;in.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Jeroboam united with his prie&s;ts, not only made laws to puni&s;h nonconformi&s;ts, but did lay wait for them, to catch them, as a &s;nare in Mizpah, and a net &s;pread in Tabor. So in like manner the pre&s;byte|rian king, and the prie&s;ts being united together, made
<PB N="9" REF="035671_0008_10069523E2ABF618">and e&s;tabli&s;hed laws calculated to catch all that would not &s;wear to conform to every point in the pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith, and to conform in every point, would in &s;ome re&s;pects, be like conforming to the calves in Dan and Bethel.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. As each party was a&s;piring after united &s;trength in their e&s;tabli&s;hments, let us now view it in its nature and con&s;equences. It is evident that Jer|oboam's calves which he &s;et up at Dan and Bethel, be|came a &s;in which de&s;troyed his kingdom forever: &s;o that his &s;uppo&s;ed &s;trength became his certain weak|ne&s;s. So in like manner it is evident that the pre&s;by|terians a&s;piring after great &s;trength, blended the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical and civil powers together, which has become a great &s;in. But let us view the con&s;equences. The civil authority that was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a great &s;trength to this building, &s;oon became its oppo&s;er. The cov|enants that bound all together by &s;olemn oaths, are committed to the flames. The e&s;tabli&s;hed laws that were all in her behalf are no more; and thus the united building is fallen, and great was the fall thereof. But &s;till &s;ome continue to e&s;pou&s;e pre&s;byteriani&s;m in all its parts; neverthele&s;s, they have fallen into &s;trife among them&s;elves; &s;ome &s;ay that I am of Paul, others &s;ay that I am of Apollos, and &s;ome &s;ay I am of Cephas; and tho&s;e that are of Paul, have excommunicated tho&s;e of Apollos and the Apollians treat the Cephians as the Jews did the Samaritans, viz. to have no dealings with them; and there are more &s;ymptoms of divi&s;ion, but I cannot as yet a&s;certain the name by which they &s;hall be known; but &s;ome of the Apollians fraimed a new confe&s;&s;ion of faith, leaving out &s;ome of tho&s;e er|rors that were in the old; but the aged fathers that had &s;worn by the great name of the Lord, to continue all the days of their lives in the obedience and doctrine of the old confe&s;&s;ion, would not receive this new con|fe&s;&s;ion for their oath &s;ake, and the compilers of the new confe&s;&s;ion, could not &s;wear to the errors of the
<PB N="10" REF="035671_0009_100695272AD62020" MS="y">old confe&s;&s;ion for their con&s;cience &s;ake. So the con|tention was great; neverthele&s;s, for peace &s;ake, con|&s;cience yielded, the old confe&s;&s;ion was rein&s;tated, and peace re&s;tored.</P>
<P>Moreover, as this new confe&s;&s;ion has made its ap|pearance among the Cephians, probably it will have &s;ome effect upon their minds. But they appear to be in a lukewarm &s;tate: our mini&s;ter in his formal way of baptizing, appears to have a venerable regard for the old confe&s;&s;ion of faith, binding all in greater or le&s;&s;er degrees, to adhere to the doctrines therein contained. Neverthele&s;s, in &s;ome other re&s;pects he practically pays but little attention to it. Some of our aged fathers re|commend it to be the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of divinity ever compo&s;ed &s;ince the days of the Apo&s;tles. Some ap|prove of great doctrinal points illu&s;trated in &s;aid con|fe&s;&s;ion, but abhor tho&s;e errors interwoven therewith. Some of our young men have bound them&s;elves to it, but never &s;ee it, nor had the knowledge of what was in it; and &s;ome, gallio like, care for none of the&s;e things.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. I proceed to make &s;ome remarks on what is &s;aid to be required in &s;ome of the commands relative to hope, &s;orrow, prayer and thank&s;giving in the name of Chri&s;t; reading, preaching and hearing the word; the admini&s;tration and receiving of the &s;acraments; church government and di&s;cipline, the mini&s;try and maintenance thereof, and religious fa&s;ting; with ma|ny other go&s;pel injunctions of the &s;ame kind, which the pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith, was fir&s;t revealed and enjoined upon Adam, for the rule of his obedience. For the proof of this a&s;&s;ertion, I &s;hall con&s;ider the im|port of the 92d, 93d and 98th que&s;tions in connection with the expo&s;itions of the fir&s;t and &s;econd command|ments in the larger catechi&s;m.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, in the 92d que&s;tion it is a&s;ked, what did God at fir&s;t reveal unto man as the rule of his obedi|ence?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="035671_0010_1006952A543A67E0">
An&s;wer. The rule of obedience revealed to Adam in the &s;tate of innocence, was the moral law, includ|ing the &s;pecial command.</P>
<P>The 93d que&s;tion explains what the moral law is, namely, a declaration of the will of God to mankind, and the 98th que&s;tion &s;ays, that this moral law is &s;um|merily comprehended in the ten commandments; then the compilers of this pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith proceed to &s;how what is required in the afore&s;aid com|mands; now provided the doctrine in the 92d, 93d and 98th que&s;tions, is true, then, if there can be found a|ny thing &s;aid to be required in the expo&s;ition of the command that never was revealed to Adam in the &s;tate of innocence, as the rule of his obedience; then the expo&s;ition is erronious, and here let it be not|ed; that, for brevity &s;ake, I &s;hall only repeat &s;uch part of the an&s;wers to the following que&s;tions as contain the contradiction in the 104th que&s;tion; it is a&s;ked, what is required in the fir&s;t commandment? An&s;wer. Hope in God, and be &s;orrowful when in any thing he is offended.</P>
<P>Now it is evident that neither this hope nor &s;orrow was revealed or enjoined upon Adam in the &s;tate of innocence, as the rule of his obedience; for it is evi|dent, that it is a go&s;pel hope that is here &s;poken of, for the &s;cripture here cited to proves the a&s;&s;ertion, &s;aith, let I&s;rael hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him there is plenteous redemption. Now mercy be&s;towed, implies guilt in the receiver, and what guilt had Adam in the &s;tate of innocence? Did a holy, a ju&s;t, a righteous God, make an unholy, un|ju&s;t, unrighteou&s;ne&s;s creature, and at the &s;ame time make him in his own likene&s;s?</P>
<P>Pau&s;e here a moment, and con&s;ider how great the incon&s;i&s;tency and abu&s;e offered to the perfections of Deity.</P>
<P>Moreover, I&s;rael was to hope in the Lord on the account of redemption; and redemption implies, that
<PB N="12" REF="035671_0011_1006952E0ED5C290">the redeemed was in a &s;tate of bondage: now I would a&s;k the pre&s;byterian, if God made man in a &s;tate of bondage? Was not he made after God's own image, knowledge, righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s; and is this likene&s;s to God a bondage to him, from which he is to hope for redemption? Furthermore, it is &s;aid in the &s;ame que&s;tion, that God requires &s;orrow when in any thing God is offended. Now if this doctrine was at fir&s;t revealed to Adam in the &s;tate of innocence, as the rule of his obedience; then it follows, that God tol|erated Adam to &s;in even in the &s;tate of innocence, and only required &s;orrow in that ca&s;e; but I &s;ubmit to your own under&s;tandings, whether it would not be more con&s;i&s;tent with the perfections of Deity, to &s;ay, that the law required ab&s;olute perfection; con&s;equently admitt|ed of no cau&s;e for &s;orrow. Now the &s;cripture cited to prove the afore&s;aid doctrine, is Jeremiah xxxi. 18. Surely I have heard Ephraim bemoaning him&s;elf, thus thou ha&s;t cha&s;ti&s;ed me and I am cha&s;ti&s;ed, as a bullock unaccu&s;tomed to the yoke; turn thou me and I &s;hall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God; and P&s;alm cxix. 136. Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, be|cau&s;e they keep not thy law. Query. Is it po&s;&s;ible in the nature of things, that the fir&s;t revelation God made to Adam as the rule of his obedience, was, to bemoan him&s;elf becau&s;e he did not receive cha&s;ti&s;ement in a &s;uitable manner from God? But the query is, what God cha&s;ti&s;ed him for. Would a holy God cha&s;|ti&s;e his own likene&s;s, his own image, con&s;i&s;ting of knowledge, righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s? But it is add|ed, turn thou me and I &s;hall be turned. Now the que&s;tion is, whether God did reveal to Adam for the rule of his obedience, that Adam &s;hould &s;ay, turn thou me from thy likene&s;s, from thy image, from thy know|ledge, from thy righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s; for as he was made with God's likene&s;s, image, knowledge, righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s, it then follows, that if he is turned he mu&s;t be turned from them. Now the
<PB N="13" REF="035671_0012_100695318993B8A0" MS="y">que&s;tion is, did God at fir&s;t reveal this to Adam as the rule of his obedience, thus to turn?</P>
<P>Ponder here upon this great ab&s;urdity and abu&s;e of|fered to the perfections of Deity; and with re&s;pect to the&s;e rivers of water running down the P&s;almi&s;t's eyes. How incon&s;i&s;tent is it to &s;uppo&s;e, that God fir&s;t reveal|ed and enjoined it upon Adam in the &s;tate of inno|cence, as the rule of his obedience, that rivers of wa|ter &s;hould run down his eyes, becau&s;e they keep not thy law; when it is evident that Adam in his fir&s;t &s;tate of innocence, was the only one of the human kind then exi&s;ting; how then could he have the&s;e rivers of wa|ter running down his eyes, becau&s;e non-exi&s;tence keep not thy law; for the word, they, being in the plural, re|fering to others, he could not po&s;&s;ibly mean him&s;elf; moreover, he was in a perfect &s;tate of happine&s;s; con|&s;equently, not a &s;ubject capable of &s;orrow or weeping. Furthermore, I aver, that the law of God fir&s;t reveal|ed to Adam in the &s;tate of innocence, the rule of his obedience, never required &s;orrow from Adam, or any of his po&s;terity on the account of &s;in; but it re|quired perfect obedience, as was before ob&s;erved; but now in this our fallen &s;tate, the revelation of the go&s;|pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t calls for &s;orrow, for brokenne&s;s of heart, for weeping, and tho&s;e under the influence of a go&s;pel &s;pirit will cry, O that mine head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night on the account of &s;in that dwells in me; and with the apo&s;tle cry, O wretched man that I am! who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this &s;in, &amp;c. I now &s;ubmit to your own under&s;tanding, the ideas &s;ug|ge&s;ted, with the a&s;&s;ertions &s;aid to be required in the command under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I now proceed to make &s;ome remarks on what is &s;aid to be required in the &s;econd commandment; and if the duties there &s;aid to be required in that com|mandment, were fir&s;t revealed to Adam in the &s;tate of
<PB N="14" REF="035671_0013_10069534B5DF6D78">may be true, otherwi&s;e it is not. Let us then at|tend to the law and to the te&s;timony, for if they &s;peak not according to the&s;e, it is becau&s;e there is no light in them.</P>
<P>It is a&s;ked, what are the duties required in the &s;econd commandment?</P>
<P>An&s;wer fir&s;t, Prayer and thank&s;giving in the name of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, Reading, preaching and hearing of the word.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, The admini&s;tration and receiving of the &s;ac|raments.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, Church government and di&s;cipline.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, The mini&s;try and maintenance thereof.</P>
<P N="6">6thly, Religious fa&s;ting.</P>
<P>I return to the fir&s;t particular, re&s;pecting prayer and thank&s;giving in the name of Chri&s;t; and would a&s;k you who take the pre&s;byterian vows upon you, if you believe that God did at fir&s;t reveal Chri&s;t in his medi|atorial character to Adam in the &s;tate of innocence, and enjoin it upon him as the rule of his obedience to pray and give thanks in Chri&s;t's name? I think that the bare &s;tating of the que&s;tion is &s;ufficient to convince any per&s;on of the error; and to undertake to prove this error would be like undertaking to prove that the &s;un gives light.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, It is &s;aid, that God, at fir&s;t, revealed and re|quired the reading, hearing and preaching of the word from Adam, in the &s;tate of innocence, as the rule of his obedience: but I pre&s;ume there was no written word to read; and if &s;o, &s;urely no preaching from the word; but if Adam had pre&s;umed to preach, I reque&s;t to know who would have been his hearers? More|over, preaching holds up to view, Chri&s;t in his media|torial character: and of what &s;ervice would this have been to Adam in the &s;tate of innocence? Judge ye.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, As to the admini&s;tration and receiving of the &s;acraments, &s;aid to be revealed to Adam in the &s;tate of innocence, as the rule of his obedience: They
<PB N="15" REF="035671_0014_100695378D128AD8" MS="y">point &s;o directly at Chri&s;t in his mediatorial &s;ufferings and atonement, that I think I may with great propri|ety &s;ay, that God never at fir&s;t revealed them to Adam in the &s;tate of innocence, as the rule of his obedience.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, As church government and di&s;cipline are &s;aid to be fir&s;t revealed to and enjoined on Adam, in the &s;tate of innocence, as the rule of his obedience, it ne|ce&s;&s;arily follows to inquire, from whom did church government derive its authority? If from God out of Chri&s;t, then the a&s;&s;ertion may be true; but if Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed the church with his own blood, and is Zion's King and Lawgiver, then it follows that Adam in the &s;tate of innocence was no member of Chri&s;t's church; con&s;equently could not have church government re|vealed to or enjoined on him, from the great Lawgiv|er, as the rule of his obedience.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, The mini&s;try and maintenance thereof, this a&s;&s;ertion being &s;o &s;imilar in various re&s;pects to the two la&s;t particulars under con&s;ideration,</P>
<P>I &s;hall, without any additional remarks, pa&s;s to the &s;ixth particular, namely, Religious fa&s;ting &s;aid to be revealed to and required of Adam in the &s;tate of inno|cence, as the rule of his obedience; and to prove this a&s;&s;ertion, Joel ii. 12. is cited, where the Lord &s;aith, "Turn ye, even to me, with all your heart, and with fa&s;ting, and with weeping, and with mourning, and rend your heart and not your gartments, and turn unto the Lord your God; for he is gracious and merciful," &amp;c. Now God calling to man to turn, implies that man has run away from God: but Adam, during the time of his innocence, walked with God: and &s;urely God never called to Adam to turn from his obedience in walking in God's image, knowledge, righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s. Moreover, it is added rend your heart and not your garment. Now Adam's &s;tate of inno|cence or perfection would not admit of this rending of heart: and why &s;hould God tell him not to rend his garment? He had no garment on till after the fall; but
<PB N="16" REF="035671_0015_10069539E6084460">one rea&s;on is added why he &s;hould turn; namely, be|cau&s;e God is gracious and merciful, which plainly im|plies, that man had fallen before ever the&s;e calls of grace were made. Moreover, the import of the words gracious and merciful, as an inducement for man to turn, makes it evident that the&s;e calls to turn, were go&s;|pel calls, made to man after the fall; con&s;equently was not revealed to Adam as the rule of his obedience be|fore the fall. Therefore the a&s;&s;ertion re&s;pecting fa&s;ting being at fir&s;t revealed and enjoined upon Adam as the rule of his obedience is a fundamental error; and &s;o in like manner are all the other a&s;&s;ertions, taken notice of, not only in this 108th que&s;tion, but al&s;o in the 104th, relative to hope and &s;orrow. I might make farther &s;imilar remarks on the erroneous expo&s;itions of &s;everal of the remaining commands, in which go&s;pel requi&s;i|tions are a&s;&s;erted to be fir&s;t revealed to Adam, in the &s;tate of innocence, as the rule of his obedience: but what has been already &s;aid on the expo&s;itions of the two former commands, is &s;ufficient to convince tho&s;e that are willing to &s;ee not only of the error of the expo&s;i|tion of the two fir&s;t commands, but al&s;o tho&s;e &s;imilar errors that are contained in the expo&s;ition of &s;everal of the remaining commands, and if there be any that will &s;hut their eyes again&s;t light and fully determined to continue all the days of their lives as they are taught in the belief of every point of the pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith, then any further illu&s;trations on the remain|ing expo&s;itions, are unnece&s;&s;ary: for if there be any that will not hear Mo&s;es and the Prophets, the law and the te&s;timony, neither would they hear or be per&s;uad|ed, though one &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead and declare unto them. Mean time I would ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e who thus believe in this compo&s;ition of law and go&s;pel, agreeably to the expo&s;ition of the commands, &s;aid to be at fir&s;t revealed to Adam in the &s;tate of innocence, as the rule of his obedience, mu&s;t, if con&s;i&s;tent, be|lieve &s;uch things re&s;pecting Deity as is not fit to be
<PB N="17" REF="035671_0016_1006953F4F1F0C48">named among chri&s;tians: for they may with the &s;ame propriety make a compound of truth and error, holi|ne&s;s and &s;in.</P>
<P>Objection. The expo&s;ition of the commands only &s;ays what is required, and what is forbidden in tho&s;e commands; but doth not &s;ay that every one of tho&s;e re|quirements was fir&s;t revealed to Adam in the &s;tate of innocence, as the rule of his obedience.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. In the 92d que&s;tion it is &s;aid, that God fir&s;t revealed to Adam the moral law, as the rule of his obedience; and the 98th que&s;tion &s;ays, that the moral law is &s;ummarily comprehended in the ten com|mands; con&s;equently every thing &s;aid to be required in any of the commands, mu&s;t be under&s;tood &s;o as to co|in&s;ide with the ground work contained in the 92d and 98th que&s;tions; all which being connected together a|mount to the very thing that I have a&s;&s;erted,&mdash;name|ly, that the expo&s;ition of the commands &s;aith, that ev|ery requirement in the commands was fir&s;t revealed to Adam, and enjoined upon him in the &s;tate of inno|cence, as the rule of his obedience.</P>
<P>Objection 2d. The Scripture was written for our learning and in&s;truction, and was given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the ex|po&s;ition of the commands are all proved by &s;cripture, and are we not bound to believe the &s;cripture.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Although we are bound to believe the &s;cripture when repre&s;ented in its true light, yet we are not bound to believe it in the light in which it may be repre&s;ented. When Chri&s;t was taken up and &s;et on the pinnacle of the temple, the Devil bid Chri&s;t to ca&s;t him&s;elf down, and immediately produced &s;crip|ture for Chri&s;t's &s;afety. Namely, it is written, he &s;hall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee, and in their hands they &s;hall bear thee up, lea&s;t at any time thou da&s;h thy foot again&s;t a &s;tone. Now it may be ob&s;erved, that the devil quoted as real &s;cripture, with
<PB N="18" REF="035671_0017_100695412257CB38" MS="y">a view to an&s;wer his purpo&s;e as Chri&s;t quoted to an|&s;wer his purpo&s;e. Who then &s;hall we believe? You will &s;ay believe Chri&s;t; but what then &s;hall we do with the devil's citation of &s;cripture? I an&s;wer, we mu&s;t be|lieve the &s;cripture to be true: but a fal&s;e light or rep|re&s;entation of Duty given from that &s;cripture, &s;o that it would not apply to prove the thing the devil quoted it for; and although the &s;cripture is pure and maje&s;tic, a&s;cribing glory to God, light and powerful in the &s;alva|tion of man, yet that &s;ame devil which attempted to lead Chri&s;t into error, and all from the pretended authori|ty of the &s;criptures, is now transforming him&s;elf into an angel of light; and repre&s;enting &s;cripture in a fal&s;e light, with a view to fru&s;trate the great de&s;igns of God relative to his own glory and the &s;alvation of man.&mdash;Hence it is that the compilers of the pre&s;byterian con|fe&s;&s;ion of faith, &s;eeing but in part hath made &s;uch error in a&s;&s;erting go&s;pel to be law, which only &s;erves to give a fal&s;e light of the &s;criptures, and puts the whole body of the &s;criptures into a compound body of confu&s;ed contradictions; but let law and go&s;pel be kept in their proper place; then the &s;criptures will appear in their purity; and the perfections of God in the di&s;play of his law will appear ju&s;t and glorious; and the great my&s;tery of godline&s;s God manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, ap|peared &s;o glorious that the heavenly ho&s;ts bur&s;t forth in a&s;cribing glory to God in the highe&s;t. How did law and go&s;pel &s;hine forth, glorious with great con&s;picuity; when mercy and truth met together, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace ki&s;&s;ed each other; when truth &s;prang out of the earth and righteou&s;ne&s;s looked down from heaven!&mdash;Query; who can view the law and go&s;pel thus in its proper light, through the of the word, and not abhor that expo&s;ition which only &s;erves to lead away the under&s;tanding from beholding the glories of the divine attributes, all meeting in Chri&s;t. Thus I have an&s;wered the objection, that although the expo&s;ition of the commands may be &s;cripture language, yet we are
<PB N="19" REF="035671_0018_100695468C777F70">not always to believe the light in which &s;cripture may be repre&s;ented.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. I proceed to con&s;ider &s;ome of the pre&s;byteri|an &s;tatute laws and principles as they are recorded in their confe&s;&s;ion of faith. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Parliament &s;ixth, of King James VI. in the year 1579, declares, <Q>that tho&s;e who agree in doctrine and admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments according to the con|fe&s;&s;ion of faith, is the true and holy church of Chri&s;t; and tho&s;e who gain&s;ay it are no members of Chri&s;t's church.</Q> From this it appears, that the pre&s;byteri|ans viewed them&s;elves as the only holy church in the world: con&s;equently the church of England, congre|gational and bapti&s;t, &amp;c, are declared to be no churches of Chri&s;t. The&s;e, likewi&s;e, are pre&s;byterian prote&s;t|ant principles; and I think they exceed the principles of tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ors we have an account of in I&s;aiah lxv. 5. who &s;aid to their fellow profe&s;&s;ors, &s;tand off by thy|&s;elf, come not near to me; for I am more holy than thou; for it is evident the&s;e Jewi&s;h profe&s;&s;ors acknowl|edged &s;ome holine&s;s in them they bid &s;tand off by them&s;elves; but our old pre&s;byterian profe&s;&s;ors would admit of none to be members of the holy church of Chri&s;t but pre&s;byterians.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, <Q>Act. 69. Parl. 6. of King James VI. declares, that there is no other &s;ace of church or face of reli|gion but the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion;</Q> namely, the pre&s;|byterian religion, and which they &s;tiled a perfect relig|ion, "and all by manifold acts of Parliament were bound to profe&s;s and &s;ub&s;cribe" to this perfect religion &mdash;namely, to the pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith, "and all &s;heriffs and magi&s;trates "were ordained to &s;earch, apprehend and puni&s;h all contraveners," which appears from Act. 5. Parl. 1. Act. 134, Parl. 7. Act. 25. Parl. 11. King James VI.</P>
<P>Query: doth the prote&s;tants really believe accord|ing to this declaration that there is no other face of church or face of religion but the pre&s;byterian religion,
<PB N="20" REF="035671_0019_100695486AEF0338">agreeably to the afore&s;aid acts of Parliament and pre&s;|byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith? Furthermore, doth the pre&s;byterians de&s;ire our civil government to make laws commanding &s;heriffs and magi&s;trates to &s;earch, appre|hend and puni&s;h, with all civil pains, our neighbour|ing churches that will not &s;ub&s;cribe and &s;wear to the afore&s;aid pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith, covenants and acts of Parliament? or doth not Mr. Oliver, teacher of pre&s;byteriani&s;m, feel a&s;hamed of his own prote&s;tant principles that &s;tand here upon record as an everla&s;ting memorandum of the bigoted per&s;ecuting &s;pirit and error of the pre&s;byterian profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, In the 47th Act. Parl. 3. King James VI. <Q>it was ordained that none &s;hould be reputed as loyal &s;ubjects, but be puni&s;hable as rebellers who would not make a confe&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;byterian principles then e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</Q> Query, doth the pre&s;by|terians (agreeably to the afore cited laws) de&s;ire that all in the United States who doth not make a profe&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;byterian principles as they were e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, &s;hould be puni&s;hed as rebels to the government.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. It was &s;tatute by acts of Parliament <Q>that all kings and princes at their coronation and reception of their princely authority, &s;hould &s;wear to maintain the true religion according to the confe&s;&s;ion of faith, and aboli&s;h all religion contrary to the &s;ame, and root out of the empire all heretics;</Q> all which appears from Parl. 12. of King James VI. and 4th Act. and Parl. 1. of King Charles I.</P>
<P>Now I would a&s;k Mr. Oliver whether he wi&s;hes to have a revolution in civil government and a new &s;y&s;tem of pre&s;byterian prote&s;tant laws e&s;tabli&s;hed agreeably to the afore&s;aid &s;tatute acts of Parliament, by which all our members of Congre&s;s would be fir&s;t required to &s;wear to the pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith.</P>

5thly. Charles I. Parliament 2. Act. 5. <Q>did or|dain and command the confe&s;&s;ion of faith, and cove|nants to be &s;ub&s;cribed by all his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects under all civil pains and ordained that it &s;hould be read and &s;worn to by every member of Parliament before they proceed to any other act, and refu&s;ers to &s;ub&s;cribe and &s;wear to &s;aid confe&s;&s;ion and covenants, were to have no voice in Parliament; and it was or|dained, that all judges, magi&s;trates or officers of any rank, and mini&s;ters at their entry &s;hould &s;wear and &s;ub&s;cribe the confe&s;&s;ion of faith and national covenant.</Q> Moreover, it was the de&s;ire of the pre&s;byterian people that the King &s;hould be cloathed with this authority: but the people in the American States po&s;&s;e&s;s a very different &s;pirit, who fraimed con&s;ti|tutions and enacted laws whereby the different denomi|nations of profe&s;&s;ors may enjoy their own religion and all have equal protection from the law, and one denom|ination of profe&s;&s;ors not to be preferred before another; and all in the union are bound to conform to their con|&s;titutional laws: con&s;equently it is incon&s;i&s;tent with common &s;en&s;e for any per&s;on to profe&s;s to adhere to the pre&s;byterian prote&s;tant religion according to the afore&s;aid &s;tatute laws and covenants, and at the &s;ame time profe&s;s &s;ubjection to the con&s;titutional laws of the United States.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. I now proceed to make &s;ome remarks rela|tive to the place in which the e&s;tabli&s;hed law of pre&s;|byterians &s;ay, marriage mu&s;t be &s;olemnized. In the direction for the &s;olemnization of marriage, they &s;ay, that <Q>marriage mu&s;t be &s;olemnized in the place ap|pointed by authority for public wor&s;hip.</Q> And as this act of divines was e&s;tabli&s;hed by an act of Parlia|ment, it therefore received the force of law in every point and execution; to pa&s;s thereon as may be &s;een by the act of Parliament at Edinburgh, February the 6th, 1645.</P>
<P>Moreover, in addition to this act of civil and eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
<PB N="22" REF="035671_0021_1006954E457D6928">authority, the Pre&s;byterians bound them&s;elves by the oath of God, to conform to &s;aid law; as may be &s;een in the &s;olemn league and covenant. From this act &s;everal things may come under our con&s;idera|tion. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Doth the word of God prohibit every other place for &s;olemnizing marriage, but the place appoint|ed for public wor&s;hip, by authority? If any &s;hould be &s;o lo&s;t as to an&s;wer in the affirmative, then the &s;econd que&s;tion is, doth the Pre&s;byterian profe&s;&s;ors pay any attention to this law, or the oath of God in the cove|nant, binding to the ob&s;ervation of this law: but per|adventure it may be &s;aid that this is a matter of no great con&s;equence; but I would reply, is it of no con|&s;equence whether we &s;ware the truth or not in point of principle, or is it of no great con&s;equence whether we walk agreeable to the truth we &s;ware. I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s this erronious doctrine with this ob&s;ervation, viz. Where per&s;ons are frequently taught to embrace by oath or otherways, a certain code of profe&s;&s;ed relig|ious laws or principles, without &s;uitable inve&s;tigation, relative to the truth or error contained in the &s;ame has a tendancy to prevent inve&s;tigation, to blind the eye, harden the heart, and &s;ear the con&s;cience, by rea|&s;on of which God's name and ordinances will be pro|faned.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. I now proceed to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations relative to the fourth article in the directory for family wor&s;hip. The a&s;&s;embly &s;aith "That it belongs to the head of the family to perform family wor&s;hip, it being always free (&s;ay they) to per&s;ons of quality to entertain one approved by the Pre&s;bytery to perform that exer|ci&s;e; and in other families where the head of the fam|ily is unfit, that another con&s;tantly re&s;iding there ap|proved of by the mini&s;ter and &s;e&s;&s;ion, may be em|ployed in that &s;ervice; wherein the mini&s;ter and &s;e&s;|&s;ion are to be accountable to the Pre&s;bytery." There are two things noticeable in this direction, viz.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="23" REF="035671_0022_1006954FEBB047C8">
1&s;t. Although it is a duty incumbent on heads of families to perform that exerci&s;e, yet a per&s;on of qual|ity may employ another to perform that wor&s;hip.&mdash; Here &s;eems to be a plain di&s;tinction between common|ality and quality, and I pre&s;ume the law of God makes none in that ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. No per&s;on, however godly and gifted he is, may be admitted to pray in a family where he doth not continue to re&s;ide. And even admitting he doth continue there, yet it is a crime to admit him to pray, until the mini&s;ter and &s;e&s;&s;ion are notified, and their ap|probation received. Furthermore, "The mini&s;ter and ruling elders in each congregation are to enquire and make trial, whether the &s;aid directions be ob&s;erved in their bounds, and &s;hall reprove and cen&s;ure &s;uch as &s;hall be found reprovable or cen&s;urable." All which appears from the act of A&s;&s;embly at Edinburgh, Au|gu&s;t the 24th, 1647.</P>
<P>Query. Provided a Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter and &s;e&s;|&s;ion, &s;hould, agreeable to the afore&s;aid act, make &s;earch through their congregation, and &s;hould find a member of their church guilty of a breach of the a|fore&s;aid act, by a&s;king &s;ome godly friend of his to pray in his family, and &s;aid member of church called before the &s;e&s;&s;ion and pre&s;bytery &s;hall refu&s;e to make any ac|knowledgment, mu&s;t they not according to the rules of church government, debar him from the privileges of the church, by excommunication or otherwi&s;e.</P>

<P N="7">7thly. I pa&s;s to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations re&s;pecting the national and &s;olemn league and covenant. And fir&s;t, it is evident, that the formation of the covenant was fir&s;t to compel all (by virtue of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority) to acknowledge that the confe&s;&s;ion of faith in every particular point was agreeable to the word of God, and then</P>

To compel all to &s;wear to continue all the days of their lives in the obedience of the doctrine and di&s;cipline of the Pre&s;byterian church, agreeable to the confe&s;&s;ion of faith; con&s;equently, the civil and eccle&s;i|a&s;tical were united together, that if any one &s;hould re|fu&s;e to &s;wear and &s;ub&s;cribe the oath and covenant, <Q>They &s;hould be puni&s;hed, with all civil pains, ca&s;t out of the church, and rooted out of the empire.</Q> All which appears from the act of A&s;&s;embly and Par|liament, dated Edinburgh, June 11th, 1640, and from &s;everal acts of Parliament, quoted in the nation|al covenant.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid in revelation 13th, that a bea&s;t did ari&s;e out of the earth, having two horns; which had power to cau&s;e that as many as would not wor&s;hip the image of the former bea&s;t &s;hould be killed; and is it not evident that the Pre&s;byterians, in their great zeal, made a cor|rupt mixture of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, with which they compelled all to &s;ubmit or &s;uffer civil pains and eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure; and &s;o far as they exceeded the bounds of God's law, &s;o far they cau&s;ed a bea&s;t to ari&s;e out of the earth.</P>
<P>And as this bea&s;t had two horns of power to put to death tho&s;e that would not wor&s;hip the image of the former bea&s;t; &s;o in like manner the Pre&s;byterian bea&s;t of error had two horns of power, viz. the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical corrupted authorities; and with the&s;e two horns they compelled all to wor&s;hip the bea&s;t of error, by &s;wearing by the great name of the Lord, that eve|ry article in the Presbyterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith, was a|greeable to the word of God, otherwi&s;e cau&s;e them to be &s;lain, by inflicting all civil pains, ca&s;ting them out of the church, and rooting them out of the empire; all which appears from their own records.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The general ideas &s;worn to in the covenant, are nothing more than what is contained in the confe&s;|&s;ion of faith at large. Neverthele&s;s, I &s;hall proceed to make &s;ome remarks on one particular declaration
<PB N="25" REF="035671_0024_10069555C7BC2210">in the national covenant; the particular that I refer to is expre&s;&s;ed in the following words, viz. <Q>Becau&s;e we perceive that the quietne&s;s and &s;tability of our relig|ion and church, doth depend upon the &s;afety and good behaviour of the king's maje&s;ty, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>This a&s;&s;ertion relative to true religion and the church'es &s;tability, depending on the &s;afety and good behav|iour of the king, is an error that invalidates the pow|er and veracity of God in the promi&s;es. Je&s;us &s;aith, upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it. Now Chri&s;t is here not only repre&s;ented as the rock on which the church is built; but likewi&s;e the builder of the church upon that rock. (Matthew xvi. 18.) Moreover, if the &s;afety and good behaviour of the king, gives &s;tability to religion and church, as the Presbyterians &s;wear it did; then it follows, that the bad behaviour of a king, makes religion and church un&s;table.</P>
<P>Now let us attend to the law and to the te&s;timony, for if they &s;peak not according to this word, it is be|cau&s;e there is no light in them.</P>
<P>When the church was carried to Babylon, they were under the Babyloni&s;h king, who was an enemy to true religion and church; and the church was there called in a way of deri&s;ion, to &s;ing one of the &s;ongs of Zion, and with great &s;tability &s;he replied; if I forget thee, O Jeru&s;alem, let my right hand forget her cunning; if I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jeru&s;alem above my chief joy; &s;o in like manner after Chri&s;t's ac&s;en&s;ion, the &s;tability of the church was great, notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition from government, and the rea&s;on is ob|vious; viz. becau&s;e the church'es &s;tability was not built upon the &s;afety and good behaviour of an earthly king, but upon the immutable God, the rock of everla&s;ting &s;trength.</P>
<P>Moreover, when king Darius &s;igned a decree, pro|hibiting prayer to God, Daniel, notwith&s;tanding the
<PB N="26" REF="035671_0025_1006955A8B659E28" MS="y">decree, manife&s;ted great &s;tability in opening his win|dows towards Jeru&s;alem, and prayed as he did afore|time. Shadrach, Me&s;hack and Abednego, manife&s;t|ed great &s;tability in refu&s;ing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the king's command; embracing the fiery furnace, rather than wor&s;hip an idol. Con&s;equently the king was a&s;toni&s;h|ed, and &s;aid, lo! I &s;ee four men walking in the mid&s;t of the fire, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God; &s;urely the&s;e men never built their faith upon the &s;afety and good behaviour of mortal fle&s;h, but up|on that God that walked with them in the mid&s;t of the fire. Moreover, in the &s;econd p&s;alm we have an ac|count of kings and rulers combining together again&s;t the Lord's anointed; but yet, (&s;aith God) have I &s;et my king upon my holy hill of Zion. Now if Chri&s;t as the church'es head, king and repre&s;entative on Zion's holy hill, was &s;table, notwith&s;tanding kings and rulers combined again&s;t him; then it follows that the church (whom Chri&s;t repre&s;ented) will, through Chri&s;t, their head, be &s;table, notwith&s;tanding kings and rulers com|bine again&s;t her; con&s;equently the a&s;&s;ertion in the oath re&s;pecting the &s;tability of religion and church, de|pending upon the &s;afety and good behaviour of the king, is an e&s;&s;ential error; and as the &s;in of Jeroboam, in making golden calves, and &s;etting them up at Dan and Bethel, was a &s;inful error which clave to his po&s;t|erity, &s;o that the &s;ucceeding kings departed not from the &s;in of Jeroboam, the &s;on of Nebat, who cau&s;ed I&s;rael to &s;in; &s;o in like manner tho&s;e golden calves of error &s;et up in the pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith at Edinburgh, and here has become a &s;in, and that fin of error cleaves to the hou&s;e of the &s;ucceeding pre&s;byterians from age to age; for as the fathers have eaten &s;our grapes of error, their children's teeth are &s;et on edge, becau&s;e they tru&s;ted, yea, &s;wore to their fath|ers' principles without due inve&s;tigation. Thus the er|rors that are contained in the afore&s;aid confe&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="27" REF="035671_0026_1006955D04051938">faith, are, by many, ignorantly embraced from age to age.</P>
<P>May the &s;pirit of the Lord lift up a &s;tandard in mount Zion, and the go&s;pel trumpet blow with a cer|tain &s;ound, and the &s;ons that the pre&s;byterian church has brought forth, ari&s;e and take their mother by the hand, leading her away from the&s;e errors, and guide her in the way of truth.</P>
<P>Objection. Although Mr. Oliver at fir&s;t bound his adherents to every paragraph of the Pre&s;byterian con|fe&s;&s;ion of faith, yet he now only binds them all the days of their lives to the prote&s;tant religion and con|fe&s;&s;ion of faith; &s;o far as they &s;hall &s;ee it agreeably to the word of God.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. If one per&s;on enter into a covenant, bind|ing him&s;elf agreeably to certain articles, to &s;erve another all the days of his life, and conforming to &s;aid articles, &s;hould be found very detrimental, they might be alter|ed; provided both parties were agreed. But if a per|&s;on bind him&s;elf to &s;erve the Lord all the days of his life, by &s;olemnly engaging to continue in the obedi|ence of a certain code of laws, and &s;aid laws &s;hould be found di&s;agreeable to the word of God, then the que&s;tion is, how &s;hall this per&s;on be di&s;engaged from his embarra&s;&s;ment? The application is obvious. Mr. Oliver has formerly bound the people to every para|graph of the confe&s;&s;ion of faith; and there are not only paragraphs, but e&s;tabli&s;hed laws in &s;aid confe&s;&s;ion of faith, which are contrary to the word of God; as hath been &s;hown, and no po&s;&s;ible way to be di&s;engaged from the embarra&s;&s;ment. For if they walk agreeably to the go&s;pel rule, they thereby break their vow, and if they perform their vow, they thereby break God's law. I &s;hall conclude this ob&s;ervation, with the ob&s;ervation that Eli made, relative to Hophni and Phinehas, the prie&s;ts of the Lord, viz. If one man &s;in again&s;t another, the judge &s;hall judge him; but if a man &s;in again&s;t the Lord, who &s;hall intreat for him.</P>

2dly. With re&s;pect to the &s;econd particular in the objection relative to Mr. Oliver's only binding his ad|herents to the prote&s;tant religion all the days of their lives, I would ob&s;erve, that according to the pre&s;by|terian confe&s;&s;ion of faith, a true prote&s;tant is a true pre&s;byterian, adhering to every article in the pre&s;by|terian confe&s;&s;ion of faith; which evidently appears im|plied in the covenants, and more particularly expre&s;&s;|ed by the general A&s;&s;embly at Edinburgh, Augu&s;t the 17th, 1643, and by the States of Parliament at Ed|inburgh, July the 15th, 1644; each one of them approving of the nece&s;&s;ity of entering into a &s;olemn league and covenant "For the pre&s;ervation of the true "prote&s;tant religion." Now if the pre&s;byterian church and &s;tate, by the afore&s;aid acts, &s;ay, that it is nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the true prote&s;tant re|ligion to enter into a &s;olemn league and covenant; then it follows, that whatever principles are contained in the afore&s;aid covenant, are the principles of a true prote&s;|tant, which leads me to con&s;ider what the&s;e prote&s;tant principles are which are contained in the afore&s;aid cov|enant. I &s;hall repeat, verbatim, the principal things contained in the covenant which are expre&s;&s;ed in the following words:</P>
<P>Namely, <Q>we all &s;ub&s;cribe, and each one of us for him&s;elf, with our hands lifted up to the mo&s;t high God, do &s;wear,</Q></P>
<Q><P>Fir&s;t. That we &s;hall, &s;incerely, really, and con|&s;tantly, through the grace of God, endeavour, in our &s;everal places and callings, the pre&s;ervation of the reformed religion in the church of Scotland, in doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline and government, a|gain&s;t our common enemies; &amp;c. and &s;hall en|deavour to bring the churches of God in the three kingdoms, to the neare&s;t conjunction and uniformi|ty in religion, confe&s;&s;ion of faith, form of church government, directory for wor&s;hip and catechizing; that we, and our po&s;terity after us, may, as breth|ren,
<PB N="29" REF="035671_0028_10069563189866E8">live in faith and love; and the Lord may de|light to dwell in the mid&s;t of us.</P>
<P>Secondly, That we will, in like manner, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, endeavour the extirpation of popery, prelacy, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We will, with the &s;ame &s;incerity, reali|ty and con&s;tancy, in our &s;everal vocations, endeav|our, with our e&s;tates and lives, mutually to pre&s;erve the rights and privileges of the parliaments, and the liberties of the kingdoms; and to pre&s;erve and de|fend the king's maje&s;ty's per&s;on and authority, in the pre&s;ervation and defence of the true religion, and liberties of the kingdoms; that the world may bear witne&s;s with our con&s;cience of our loyalty, and that we have no thoughts or intentions to dimini&s;h his maje&s;ty's ju&s;t power and greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>Fourthly, We &s;hall al&s;o, with all faithfulne&s;s, en|deavour the di&s;covery of all &s;uch as have been, or &s;hall be incendiaries, malignants, or evil in&s;tru|ments, by hindering the reformation of religion, di|viding the king from his people, or one of the king|doms from another, or making any faction or par|ties among&s;t the people, contrary to this league and covenant.</P>
<P>Fifthly, And whereas the happine&s;s of a ble&s;&s;ed peace between the&s;e kingdoms, denied in former times to our progenitors, is by the providence of God granted unto us, and hath been lately conclud|ed, and &s;ettled by both parliaments; we &s;hall each one of us, according to our place and intere&s;t, en|deavour that they may remain conjoined in a firm peace and union to all po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Sixthly, We &s;hall, al&s;o, according to our places and callings, in this common cau&s;e of religion, lib|erty and peace of the kingdoms, a&s;&s;i&s;t and defend all tho&s;e that enter into this league and covenant, in the maintaining and pur&s;uing thereof: and &s;hall not &s;uffer our&s;elves directly or indirectly, by what&s;oever
<PB N="30" REF="035671_0029_1006956646940948">combination, per&s;ua&s;ion or terror, to be divided and withdrawn from this ble&s;&s;ed union and conjunc|tion, whether to make defection to the contrary part, or to give our&s;elves to a dete&s;table indifferen|cy, or neutrality in this cau&s;e, that &s;o much con|cerneth the glory of God, the good of the king|dom, and honour of the king; but &s;hall all the days of our lives zealou&s;ly and con&s;tantly continue therein, again&s;t all oppo&s;ition, and promote the &s;ame, according to our power, again&s;t all lets and imped|iments what&s;oever; and what we are not able our|&s;elves to &s;uppre&s;s or overcome, we &s;hall reveal and make known, that it may be timely prevented or removed: all which we &s;hall do as in the &s;ight of God. And this covenant we make in the pre&s;ence of almighty God, the Searcher of all hearts, with a true intention to perform the &s;ame, as we &s;hall an|&s;wer at the great day, when the &s;ecrets of all hearts &s;hall be di&s;clo&s;ed.</P></Q>
<P>Thus I have repeated, verbatim, the principal things contained in the afore&s;aid covenant; con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix particulars; and they all coincide with and enforce the ob&s;ervance of all that is contained in the pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith: con&s;equently it proves, to a punc|tilio, that, according to the pre&s;byterian principles, a true prote&s;tant is a pre&s;byterian: con&s;equently the fir&s;t reformers profe&s;&s;ing prelacy and lutergy with their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors in religion, were not con&s;idered by the pre&s;byte|rians as true prote&s;tants: for the pre&s;byterians, by acts of a&s;&s;embly and parliament, dated Edinburgh, Augu&s;t 17th, 1643, and Edinburgh, July 15th, 1644, con|&s;idered it nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the true prot|i&s;tant religion, to enter into a &s;olemn league and cove|nant; and they are bound by the articles of &s;aid cove|nant to extirpate popery, prelacy, lutergy and every other profe&s;&s;ion that deviates in any particular from the pre&s;byterian profe&s;&s;ion, then it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that a true prote&s;tant is one that believes in every point or
<PB N="31" REF="035671_0030_1006956AB19F8D60">paragraph of the pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith, bind|ing him&s;elf by the oath of God, to continue all the days of his life in the obedience of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Thus I have given a true definition of a true prot|e&s;tant, according to the pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith. Hearken, then, O thou young pre&s;byterian prote&s;tant! It is for thy &s;ake (that thou mighte&s;t be no longer blind|fold and lead through &s;uch dark paths of error) that I have traced the prote&s;tant principles: and although thou may&s;et &s;wear again&s;t popery as the prote&s;tants did, yet how can&s;t thou lift up thy hand to the mo&s;t high God, as they did, and &s;wear,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that the power of the civil magi&s;trate in the church (agreeably to the 23d, and expo&s;ition of the 31&s;t chapters in the pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith) is agreeably to the word of God?</P>
<P>Secondly, Swear that the expo&s;ition of the com|mands (relative to <Q>hope, &s;orrow, prayer and thank&s;|giving in the name of Chri&s;t; reading, preaching and hearing the word; the admini&s;tration and re|ceiving of the &s;acrament; church government and di&s;cipline; the mini&s;try and maintenance thereof, and religious fa&s;ting) was at fir&s;t revealed and en|joined upon Adam, in the &s;tate of innocence, as the rule of his obedience?</Q></P>
<P>Thirdly, Can&s;t thou &s;wear that it is the command of God to <Q>root out of the empire, as heretics, all that will not profe&s;s pre&s;byteriani&s;m</Q> agreeably to the pre&s;byterian &s;tatute laws made under the reign of king James and king Charles?</P>
<P>Fourthly, Can&s;t thou &s;wear, that <Q>they are no members of Chri&s;t's church if they gain&s;ay the pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;ion of faith;</Q> and &s;wear that it is the civil magi&s;trate's prerogative to take the keys of Chri&s;t's kingdom to open or &s;hut the doors of the church for or again&s;t &s;uch as approve or di&s;approve the articles contained in the confe&s;&s;ion of faith?</P>
<P>Fifthly, Can&s;t thou &s;wear, <Q>that there is no other
<PB N="32" REF="035671_0031_1006956C68D05188">face of religion or church but the pre&s;byterian</Q> and &s;wear that the pre&s;byterian religion is perfect?</P>
<P>Sixthly, Can&s;t thou &s;wear that all ought to be pun|i&s;hed as "rebels to the government that will not make "a confe&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;byterian principles?</P>
<P>Seventhly, Can&s;t thou &s;wear, that the word of God forbids &s;olemnizing marriage, unle&s;s in a place appoint|ed by authority for public wor&s;hip?</P>
<P>Eighthly, Can&s;t thou &s;wear, that it is a violation of the divine law to admit a per&s;on to pray in thy hou&s;e, without fir&s;t applying to the mini&s;ter and &s;e&s;&s;ion for their approbation?</P>
<P N="9">9thly. Can&s;t thou &s;wear to the fir&s;t part of the oath in the national convenant, viz. <Q>That there is no oth|er religion plea&s;ing to God, or bringing &s;alvation to man, but the pre&s;byterian religion?</Q></P>
<P N="10">10thly. Can&s;t thou &s;wear to the &s;econd article in the covenant, viz. <Q>That you agree in your own con|&s;cience to all points of the afore&s;aid confe&s;&s;ion of faith, as unto God's undoubted truth.</Q></P>
<P N="11">11thly. Can&s;t thou &s;wear to the third article, viz. <Q>That the &s;tability of religion and church, depends upon the &s;afety and good behaviour of the king's maje&s;ty?</Q></P>
<P N="12">12thly. Can&s;t thou with the prote&s;tant in the cove|nant <Q>Lift up thy hand and &s;wear by the great name of the Lord, that thou will defend the king's maje&s;|ty, with thy goods, body and life; calling the liv|ing God, the Searcher of hearts to witne&s;s, that this is your de&s;ire and unfeigned re&s;olution, as you will an&s;wer to Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the great day, and under the pain of God's everla&s;ting wrath, and of infamy and lo&s;s of all honour and re&s;pect in the world.</Q>&mdash;As the&s;e twelve particulars are all parts of the prote&s;t|ant religion contained in the confe&s;&s;ion of faith; if thou can&s;t &s;wear that they are all agreeably to the word of God, and that thou wilt continue all the days of thy life in the obedience of the &s;ame, then thou art &s;o
<PB N="33" REF="035671_0032_10069570DC087F98">far qualified for being a Prote&s;tant. Mean time it is worthy of notice, that the Pre&s;byterian kings, Parlia|ments, maje&s;trates, &amp;c. were all &s;worn to &s;upport the Pre&s;byterian principles, according to the confe&s;&s;ion of faith; &s;o in like manner the prote&s;tants prote&s;ted and &s;wore, by the great name of the Lord, that they would &s;ubmit to and defend the king's maje&s;ty, his per&s;on and authority, in the execution of the afore&s;aid Pre&s;by|terian laws. But the Pre&s;byterian kings have revolted from Presbyteriani&s;m, burnt the covenants which were the bond of union, and a new code of laws made by which each one may enjoy his own religion, and have equal protection from government. Con&s;equently a papi&s;t has the &s;ame protection from government that a pre&s;|byterian has.</P>
<P>Now the great que&s;tion is, where is the king and parliament at this day, whom our young Prote&s;tants &s;wear to defend?</P>
<P>It prote&s;tants voluntarily &s;wear to defend a king in the execution of tho&s;e laws which protect a papi&s;t in his religion, then they are guilty of a breach of the oath of God in the covenants and pre&s;byterian laws in the confe&s;&s;ion of faith. Furthermore, if the young pre&s;byterian prote&s;tants take upon them the old prot|e&s;tant vows, and do not protect &s;ome king and parlia|ment in the execution of pre&s;byterian laws according to the confe&s;&s;ion of faith, then they are chargeable with a breach of their oath in the covenant: but it is probable no &s;uch king and parliament will be found; but even admitting they &s;hould be found, would not the oath of allegiance to them be rebellion again&s;t the United States? yea, a breach of the oath of allegi|ance? But provided the prote&s;tants &s;hould &s;ay, that they mean to &s;ubmit to and defend the authority of the United States in the &s;ame manner that the old prote&s;|tants &s;ubmitted to and defended king and parliament, I would reply, we have neither king, parliament nor pre&s;byterian laws, agreeably to pro&s;tetant principles in
<PB N="34" REF="035671_0033_10069573BA0E4248">the confe&s;&s;ion of faith; but the rever&s;e by giving the &s;ame protection to a papi&s;t as to a pre&s;byterian. Con|&s;equently the oath of God in the covenants and prote&s;|tant laws in the confe&s;&s;ion of faith, forbids prote&s;tant &s;ubjection to the authority of the United States.</P>
<P>Thus I have traced &s;ome of the prote&s;tant errors, both re&s;pecting principles and oaths: and &s;urely the prote&s;tants are in a very &s;ingular &s;ituation; for they are &s;o bound with laws and oaths that even where greater light appears and truth calling them to turn, the oath of God which they have taken, will not &s;uffer them to turn. Con&s;equently if they march forward, according to the prote&s;tant &s;y&s;tem, they, in many re&s;pects, break God's law; and if they retreat back, or even &s;tand &s;till, they break their oath: but as I can trace them no farther here, I mu&s;t leave them, and bid them adieu.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, as the&s;e prote&s;tant pre&s;byterian prin|ciples and oaths contained in the pre&s;byterian confe&s;&s;|ion of faith do, in a &s;pecial manner, concern the Par|i&s;h in Pelham, I would &s;ubmit to their own under|&s;tanding who hath required the&s;e things at your hands? Jophthah (without a call from God) bound him&s;elf with a vow, that if God would deliver his enemies into his hand, when he returned in peace, he would offer up, for a burnt offering, whatever would meet him in the door of his hou&s;e. And God gave him a great victory over his enemies. And at his return, God providentially &s;ent his only daughter to the door of her father's hou&s;e with timbrels, &amp;c. at which &s;ight, Jephthah remembering his vow, cried out, alas! thou ha&s;t brought me very low, my daughter; for I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I cannot go back. Now it is worthy of notice, that God's law did not re|quire, con&s;equently forbid Jephthah to offer up his daughter for a burnt offering; but his vow bound him to it&mdash;&s;o that if he attended to the law of God, he mu&s;t break his vow; and if he performed his vow, he mu&s;t break the law of God. So in like manner,
<PB N="35" REF="035671_0034_10069576CF4C3E98">&s;ome of you have taken the American con&s;titutional oath, by which you are bound to demean your&s;elves as loyal &s;ubjects of the United States; and to renounce and oppo&s;e the king's juri&s;diction in every particular. And you have likewi&s;e taken the pre&s;byterian prote&s;tant vows upon you, by which you have bound your&s;elves to &s;ubmit to the King's authority, both in eccle&s;ia&s;tial and civil matters; defending him with your goods, bodies and lives; and thus like Jephthah, you have (by your vows) brought your&s;elves into a &s;nare, out of which you never can extricate your&s;elves. Tell not &s;uch contradictory vows in Gath, nor publi&s;h &s;uch pro|fanity of God's name in the &s;treets of A&s;hkelon, le&s;t the uncircumci&s;ed rejoice.</P>
<P>Contemplate then upon thine own incon&s;iderate in|con&s;i&s;tency; and thou maye&s;t likewi&s;e look upon thy prote&s;tant Teacher, and &s;ay, alas! thou ha&s;t brought me very low; for thou ha&s;t lead me to open my moth in making the&s;e pre&s;byterian vows to the Lord; and like Jephthah, I cannot go back, neither can I con|&s;i&s;tently with truth perform my vows. Alas! my Teacher, thou ha&s;t brought me very low. But as there are &s;ome of the Pari&s;h that have not brought them|&s;elves under &s;uch contradictory vows, I would &s;ay to them be careful about bringing your&s;elves under any profe&s;&s;ed religious vows or acknowledgments of prin|ciples, where human wi&s;dom forms them, &s;wears to them, and calls upon thee to &s;wear to them. Con&s;id|er fir&s;t whether the&s;e principles are built upon the word of truth in every particular; and &s;econdly, whether God calls thee to &s;wear. For even admitting the thing is true which man calls thee to &s;wear; thou mu&s;t have a "thus &s;aith the Lord," as a warrant for thy &s;wear|ing the truth: for it is evident God doth not call thee to &s;wear to every truth. But I would &s;ay to thee as in the words of in&s;piration, be not ra&s;h with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be ha&s;ty to utter any thing before God. Better it is that thou &s;hould&s;t not
<PB N="36" REF="035671_0035_10069579A93C6D50">vow than that thou &s;hould&s;t vow and not pay; for thus &s;aith the Lord, when thou &s;halt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou &s;halt not be &s;lack to pay it, for the Lord thy God will &s;urely require it of thee, and it would be &s;in in thee not to perform it; but if thou &s;halt forbare to vow, it &s;hall be no &s;in in thee.</P>
<P>Objection. Notwith&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid in oppo&s;ition to the pre&s;byterian principles, yet God has owned the pre&s;byterian religion in a di&s;tingui&s;hing manner by the effu&s;ion of his &s;pirit; therefore that re|ligion mu&s;t be right which God thus owns.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Although God might in former times (when the church was coming out of popi&s;h darkne&s;s) wink at error, and at the &s;ame time pour out his &s;pirit on &s;aid church, yet the out-pouring of his &s;pirit by no means proves, that they were not chargeable with great error, neither doth it prove (that if they now refu&s;e to repent at God's call) that God will not fight again&s;t them with the &s;word of his mouth or ca&s;t them into a bed of great tribulation or kill their children with death, as he threatened &s;ome of the A&s;ian churches, if they did not repent. Therefore let &s;uch as are taught to build upon this &s;andy foundation, here what the Spirit &s;aith unto the A&s;ian churches. And your atten|tion is here called to the church of Pergamos, who dwelt where &s;atan's feat was; neverthele&s;s recommend|ed for holding fa&s;t God's name and not denying the faith; although the acknowledging of it made An|tipas fall a martyr. Now it is evident that the &s;pirit of God was poured out in a powerful manner upon this church; otherwi&s;e they would not be entitled to their recommendation. And yet God charges them with two doctrinal errors, for which they are threatened with God's fighting again&s;t them, it they did not repent. And in like manner the church of Thyatira was re|commended for her works, and charity, and &s;ervice, and faith, and patience, and the la&s;t to be more than the fir&s;t; neverthele&s;s was chargeable with doctrinal er|ror
<PB N="37" REF="035671_0036_1006957C9B2B23A0">and threatened with judgments, if &s;he did not re|pent. And now we are called to hear what the Spirit &s;aith unto the churches. And you have heard what the Spirit &s;aith relative to the afore&s;aid churches. And the Spirit el&s;ewhere &s;aith, that what was written afore|time was written for our learning and in&s;truction. And if we will learn or be in&s;tructed by the Spirit in the word, we may learn that although the &s;pirit of God might be poured out upon the pre&s;byterian churches as it was upon the church of Pergamos and Thiatira; neverthele&s;s, the pre&s;byterian church may be chargea|ble with great error, as the afore&s;aid churches were; and called to repent, and threatened with judgments if they do not repent, as tho&s;e churches were; con&s;e|quently the objection mu&s;t vani&s;h before the words of the &s;pirit of truth as the darkne&s;s of the night before the ri&s;ing &s;un.</P>
<P>I now proceed to make &s;ome remarks re&s;pecting the duty of &s;upporting go&s;pel mini&s;ters; but e&s;pecially the manner in which they are to be &s;upported. And</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. It is evident, that Chri&s;t commi&s;&s;ioned his a|po&s;tles or mini&s;ters to go and preach the go&s;pel. And the apo&s;tle Paul &s;aith that the Lord hath ordained that tho&s;e that preach the go&s;pel &s;hould live of the go&s;pel. For &s;aith the apo&s;tle who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock? And the law of Mo&s;es &s;aith, thou &s;halt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn; and they which mini&s;|ter about holy things live of the things of the temple; and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar. And the apo&s;tle &s;aith, let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. And where we find a faithful mini&s;ter that will venture to tru&s;t God and the people for his &s;upport, the people are under the greate&s;t obligation to remember him and contribute towards his &s;up|port.
<PB N="38" REF="035671_0037_1006957FE4EACA58">But to forget their mini&s;ters, in this ca&s;e, would be forgetting their God who &s;upports them; and have a tendency to remove the candle&s;tick out of its place, and make their &s;ouls like a barren tree in the garden of the Lord. For the apo&s;tle in the fixth of Galatians, after &s;peaking of the duty of com|municating, &s;aith, be not deceived, God is not mock|ed; for what&s;oever a man &s;oeth, that &s;hall he reap.</P>
<P>Secondly, I now proceed to make &s;ome remarks rel|ative to the manner in which go&s;pel mini&s;ters ought to be &s;upported. It is evident, from &s;cripture, that Chri&s;t has ordained that his mini&s;ters &s;hall receive all as a free will offering of the church or people where they la|bour; but no tax levied for civil officers to collect by attaching property or otherwi&s;e. And to prove this af|fertion, let us attend to the law and to the te&s;timony; and &s;ee what the &s;pirit of God &s;aith by the apo&s;tle Paul, in Philipians 4th, 10th and downwards, which contains a recommendation of the Philipians for communicat|ing to Paul's nece&s;&s;ity. Mean time Paul &s;peaks of it in the 17th ver&s;e as a gift, and in the 18th ver&s;e, re|ferring to their communicating, &s;ays, that it is an odour of a &s;weet &s;mell, a &s;acrafice acceptable and well plea&s;|ing to God. Now if this way of collecting &s;upport for mini&s;ters was well plea&s;ing to God, then it ought to be &s;trictly attended to. Furthermore, in Paul's fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, 9th chapter, the apo&s;tle &s;heweth, at large, how the Lord hath ordained that they that preach the go&s;pel &s;hould live of the go&s;pel; but Paul's epi&s;tle never was directed to the civil mag|i&s;trate nor legi&s;lative body for their interpo&s;ition: but it was directed to the church of God at Corinth, with all that in every place call upon the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord: from which it plainly appears, that the duty of &s;upporting go&s;pel mini&s;ters is a matter that concerns the church and not the civil government. Moreover, in the whole of Paul's epi&s;tles, when he recommends or enjoins the duty of liberality, gifts,
<PB N="39" REF="035671_0038_10069582D77EE098">freewill offerings, communicating or bounties either for the &s;upport of mini&s;ters or poor &s;aints, he there writes particularly to the churches; and he farther &s;aith, that their liberality was an evidence of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the go&s;pel, as appears from 2d Corinthians ix. 13. In Paul's epi&s;tle to the churches of Galaria, he &s;aith, that the go&s;pel which he preached was revealed to him by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and in that &s;ame epi&s;tle, Paul writes to the churches &s;howing them the duty of communi|cating to their teacher. Now if Je&s;us Chri&s;t has re|vealed to the churches, by Paul (as hath been &s;hown) that his mini&s;ters mu&s;t be &s;upported by a freewill offer|ing of the church, then it follows that the churches ought to pay due attention to the orders that Chri&s;t has given: and then their offerings will be an odour of a &s;weet &s;mell, a &s;acrifice acceptable and well plea&s;ing to God. From which we may infer that no &s;trange fire of twon or pari&s;h forcibly taxing to &s;upport mini&s;ters, is an odour of a &s;weet &s;mell; no &s;trange fire of con&s;ta|bles attaching property and di&s;po&s;ing of it for le&s;s than its real value, accepted as an odour of a &s;weet &s;mell; but all may be &s;aid to be a &s;moke in God's no&s;tril, yea a fire that burneth all the day.</P>
<P>How criminal then mu&s;t tho&s;e &s;ocieties be, who (de&s;|pi&s;ing the wi&s;dom of God in the method recommend|ed and enjoined upon the churches for &s;upporting min|i&s;ters) prefer their own wi&s;dom in taxing, as more ju&s;t and righteous than God's. But let &s;uch &s;ocieties hear what in&s;piration &s;aith; Shall mortal man be more ju&s;t than God? Shall a man be more ju&s;t than his Ma|ker? Job iv. 17. Mu&s;t the wi&s;dom of the eternal I AM, the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the Fir&s;t and the La&s;t, be de&s;pi&s;ed, and man's wi&s;|dom prefered? Be a&s;toni&s;hed, O ye heavens! and be ye afraid, who thus build up walls with the tool of hu|man invention, and plai&s;ter them with &s;uch untemper|ed mortar!</P>
<P>The &s;acred writings give an account of Naaman the
<PB N="40" REF="035671_0039_10069585F1E208E8" MS="y">A&s;&s;yrian who was a leper, and came to a prophet of the Lord to be healed of his leprocy; and the prophet bade the leper go and wa&s;h in Jordan &s;even times, and be clean. The leper at fir&s;t depi&s;ed the word of the Lord, &s;poken by the prophet; and prefered his own wi&s;dom in e&s;teeming the waters of Abana and Pharpar better than the waters of I&s;rael. Thus the leper turn|ed away from the word of the Lord. And are we not all (by nature) covered over with the lepro&s;y of &s;in? God has in&s;tituted go&s;pel ordinances, for the recovery of our lepro&s;y; and will you, like Naaman, di&s;pute the wi&s;dom of God relative to the method of cure? Naaman's wi&s;dom not perceiving God to work by what means he plea&s;ed, called in que&s;tion the excellence of of the water to which he was directed. And will you practically and profe&s;&s;edly di&s;pute the wi&s;dom, the equi|ty or expedience of our Lord's revelation to the apo&s;tle Paul relative to the manner of &s;upporting go&s;pel min|i&s;ters, who&s;e labours, when ble&s;&s;ed, are a mean in God's hand to recover us of our lepro&s;y?</P>
<P>When God gave Mo&s;es direction re&s;pecting build|ing the altar of whole &s;tone, he adds, if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou ha&s;t polluted it; and enjoins it upon Mo&s;es to &s;ee that every thing &s;hould be done ac|cording to the pattern &s;hown in the mount. Now if this altar would be polluted, if a tool was lifted upon it, then we may, with equal propriety, infer, that if af|ter Chri&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> what this altar pointed at (and as king in his church in&s;tituted laws and ordinances for his church &s;trictly to attend to, till his &s;econd coming) that if the tool of human invention is lifted up to new mod|el the laws and ordinances, then they are polluted. Furthermore, God &s;ays, he hates robbery for a burnt offering; which leads me to inquire when a church may be guilty of robbery, and offering it to the Lord. To which I would an&s;wer, when the church profe&s;&s;es a de|&s;ire to attend upon go&s;pel ordinances, and partake of go&s;|pel privileges; but at the &s;ame time is not willing to
<PB N="41" REF="035671_0040_10069588CCA5B778">advance all their own property to defray the expen&s;e. Con&s;equently attaches the property of others who dif|fer with them in opinion, and di&s;po&s;es of &s;aid property for much le&s;s than its real value; pre&s;enting all to their mini&s;ter, as a reward for his mini&s;terial &s;ervice. All being thus done with a profe&s;&s;ed view to &s;upport the go&s;pel. The way being thus paved, the doors are kept open for all to meet and offer the &s;acrifice of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving to God; then it may with great proprie|ty be &s;aid, that this church is guilty of robbery, and offering it to the Lord. But God not only hates rob|bery for an offering, but refu&s;es to accept an offering of lean, &s;ick, torn or blind; how then can you that are thus guilty pre&s;ume to enter the door of God's hou&s;e to offer the &s;acrifice of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving, when your own con&s;cience witne&s;&s;es again&s;t you that you have robed your neighbours, by attaching their property, and di&s;po&s;ing of it, to enable you in a cheaper way to &s;acrifice to the Lord? But hear what the Lord &s;aith in the matter, cur&s;ed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male, and avoweth and &s;acrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing, for I am a great king &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;t.</P>
<P>When the anger of the Lord was kindled again&s;t I&s;|rael, and David numbered the people; the Lord &s;ent the plague of pe&s;tilence among the people, and when the angel &s;tretched out his hand upon Jeru&s;alem, to de|&s;troy it, the Lord &s;aid to the angel, &s;tay now thine hand; and David was there called to &s;acrifice to the Lord, and Araunah the Jebu&s;ite offered to give David the oxen and thre&s;hing in&s;truments for a burnt offer|ing; but David, from a &s;en&s;e of his own &s;in, in numb|ering the people, and a &s;en&s;e of his duty to his God, would neither attach his neighbour's property in order that his neighbour might bear a part of the co&s;t of the &s;acrifice, nor even accept of it as a gift; but told A|raunah that he would not offer a burnt offering to the Lord his God that which co&s;t him nothing. Con&s;e|quently
<PB N="42" REF="035671_0041_1006958BBB272C58">he bought the materials, and offered burnt of|ferings and peace offerings, and the Lord was intreat|ed for the land, and the plague was &s;tayed. Go thou and do likewi&s;e, that our &s;piritual plagues may be &s;tay|ed, and the Lord be intreated for our land.</P>
<P>Objection. Tho&s;e offerings under the law were to be whole, without blemi&s;h, that they might be figura|tive of Chri&s;t, who was without &s;pot; and who was to offer up him&s;elf as a &s;acrifice to God, in behalf of &s;inful man: con&s;equently the ob&s;ervations re&s;pecting tho&s;e &s;acrifices under the law, cannot apply to the &s;up|port of mini&s;ters under the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. If there was no go&s;pel in tho&s;e legal &s;ac|rifices, then it is evident, that the Old te&s;tament &s;aints obtained eternal life by the works of the law. But I pre&s;ume you will agree to the go&s;pel revelation, which &s;ays, that by the deeds of the law no fle&s;h living &s;hall be ju&s;tified: con&s;equently it follows, that there was a great di&s;play of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t in tho&s;e &s;acrifices. And &s;o far as the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t &s;hone in tho&s;e legal &s;acrifices, &s;o far, and in the &s;ame go&s;pel light, will tho&s;e ob&s;ervations, drawn from the legal &s;acrifices, ap|ply, to our &s;upporting go&s;pel mini&s;ters, in this our go&s;|pel day. Moreover, as the in&s;tituted way of wor&s;hip, in offering &s;acrifice under the law, could not be done without expen&s;e, &s;o under the go&s;pel, God's mini&s;ters and our go&s;pel religion, cannot be &s;upported without expen&s;e: con&s;equently it follows, that in this re&s;pect the &s;acrifice and offerings under the law, and the &s;acri|fice and offerings for &s;upporting mini&s;ters under the go&s;pel, are exactly &s;imilar; and in that light, the ob|&s;ervations that will apply in one ca&s;e, will apply in the other; which proves the objection to be wholly ground|le&s;s; neverthele&s;s, the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion will &s;till appear more evident from tho&s;e go&s;pel &s;acrifices, which the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of in Philipians iv. 18. where the apo&s;tle &s;peaking of the Philipians' communicating or gifts for his &s;upport, &s;ays that it was an odour of a
<PB N="43" REF="035671_0042_1006958E33722E68">&s;weet &s;mell, a &s;acrifice acceptable and well plea&s;ing to God, as hath been before ob&s;erved. And the &s;ame apo&s;tle, in Hebrews xiii. 15, 16. &s;ays, let us offer the &s;acrifice of prai&s;e continually; and adds, forget not to communicate; for with &s;uch &s;acrifice God is well plea&s;|ed. Now the apo&s;tle in enjoining the&s;e go&s;pel &s;acrifi|ces mu&s;t have &s;ome reference to the go&s;pel that was revealed in tho&s;e &s;acrifices under the law, which makes it evident, that tho&s;e &s;acrifices under the law (although in &s;ome re&s;pects figurative of Chri&s;t in pointing direct|ly at the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t as our &s;urety, yet in other re&s;pects) refered to the go&s;pel way of means of &s;alva|tion thro' Chri&s;t. Moreover it is evident, from tho&s;e go&s;pel &s;acrifices that were offered under the law. When Jonah was in the whale's belly he was incapaci|tated to offer legal offerings, or in that way to &s;acrifice unto the Lord, yet he by faith looking toward God's holy temple &s;ays, I will &s;acrifice unto the Lord with the voice of thank&s;giving. And the P&s;almi&s;t in the 116th p&s;alm &s;ays, What &s;hall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I will take the cup of &s;alvation and call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord in the pre&s;ence of all his people. I will offer to thee the &s;acrifice of thank&s;giv|ing, and will call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord now, in the pre&s;ence of all his people, in the courts of the Lord's hou&s;e, in the mid&s;t of thee O! Jeru&s;alem. And what think ye that profe&s;s to take the cup of &s;alvation; will you offer to God the go&s;pel &s;acrifice of prai&s;e and thank&s;|giving upon your own co&s;t? or will you &s;end an officer to attach your neighbour's property to help to pay for your &s;acrifice? Query. Is it not expedient to have a princely &s;pirit, and out of your own property pay your vows unto the Lord, and then come into the courts of the Lord's hou&s;e in the mid&s;t of thee, O! Jeru&s;alem or church of Pelham, and &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t, what &s;hall I render to the Lord for all his benefits
<PB N="44" REF="035671_0043_10069592710754A0">towards me? The&s;e ob&s;ervations, duly con&s;idered, may &s;erve as an an&s;wer to the objection.</P>
<P>Objection &s;econd. If all are left to their own free will relative to paying mini&s;ters, we &s;hall &s;oon have no mini&s;ters among us, and religion rooted out of the land.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. This objection ari&s;es from unbelief, as it calls in que&s;tion the word and power of the divine Spir|it; for when Chri&s;t had accompli&s;hed all that he came to do and &s;uffer, he promi&s;ed to &s;end the comforter; and after his a&s;cen&s;ion (according to his promi&s;e) the power of his &s;pirit came upon them: con&s;equently re|ligion was planted where the civil authority oppo&s;ed and tried to root it out. And in&s;piration &s;aith, not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts. Who art thou, O! great mountain before Zerubbabel? Thou &s;halt become a plain; and he &s;hall bring forth the head &s;tone thereof with &s;houting; cry|ing grace, grace, unto it. Mean time I grant that the go&s;pel way, pointed out for &s;upporting mini&s;ters, may have a tendency to root out tho&s;e mini&s;ters whom God never planted; but there is no danger of rooting out tho&s;e whom God hath cho&s;en and called to the mini&s;|try. Paul had but a &s;mall inncome of the world for his mini&s;terial labours: yet being cho&s;en, qualified and called to preach the go&s;pel, he &s;aith, wo is me if I preach not the go&s;pel. Jeremiah, under reproaches and bad &s;ucce&s;s, &s;aid that he would not &s;peak any more in God's name; but he immediately replies, that God's word was in his heart as a burning fire &s;hut up in his bones, and was weary with forbearing. And in the 32d of Job we have an account of Elihu's &s;aying I am full of the matter. The Spirit within me con|&s;traineth me. Behold my belly is as wine which has no vent; it is ready to bur&s;t like new bottles. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture manife&s;t the power of God's Spir|it in the hearts of God's me&s;&s;engers: and you may as well think to root out God's &s;pirit as to root out God's
<PB N="45" REF="035671_0044_10069594E1858B00">mini&s;ters. Thus pre&s;&s;ed with the power of God's &s;pir|it influencing them to cry aloud and not &s;pare; yea, to lift up their voice like a trumpet, &s;hewing the people their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, &amp;c. Mean time they know that God claims a prerogative over the flax and wool, the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t and the cattle upon a thou&s;and hills, the fowls of the mountains and wild bea&s;ts of the field, yea, the world and the fulne&s;s thereof, and the hearts of all that po&s;&s;e&s;s it are in his hands and he can turn them whither&s;oever he plea&s;es, even as the rivers of wa|ter. And the good mini&s;ter knowing this is willing to tru&s;t his God, knowing that God can and will influence the people voluntarily to give to their mini&s;ter that de|gree of &s;upport which God &s;hall &s;ee mo&s;t conducive to his glory and the mini&s;ter's good: for no good thing will he with hold from them that walk uprightly. Nev|erthele&s;s, if any of God's mini&s;ters &s;hould, in a peev|i&s;n fret, like Jonah, run away from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, they may expect God's judgments to fol|low them, as they did Jonah, until they return to their duty as Jonah returned to his, by preaching the word that God bid him; and as to religion's being rooted out of the land as mentioned in the objection, I would ob&s;erve that a deviation from the go&s;pel rule is the mo&s;t probable way to root religion out of the land.&mdash;Saul deviated from the law of God, which rooted him and his out of the land. Solomon in his old days turned from the law of his God, for which the princi|pal part of his kingdom was rooted up, and the law not being attended to by the people, religion depreci|ated greatly out of the land, till by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive devia|tions from the law of God, they were rooted out of their own land. The Jewi&s;h church by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive de|viations from the law of God, rooted out not only re|ligion, but them&s;elves, as a church or nation; and the apo&s;tle in fir&s;t Corinthians, 10th chapter, illu&s;trating the privileges of the Jewi&s;h church, and the errors which that church run into, with the puni&s;hment which
<PB N="46" REF="035671_0045_10069597EC93B670">en&s;ued; &s;ays, that tho&s;e things were written for our ad|monition. Now if we will be admoni&s;hed, we mu&s;t know that a deviation from the rules that God has pre|&s;cribed, incurs his wrath, and has a tendence to root religion out of the land. Therefore, if you wi&s;h to a|void tho&s;e evils again&s;t which we are admoni&s;hed, and to have the power of religion among us, the ordinan|ces being no more like dry brea&s;ts, then give due at|tention to the divine precepts; ever remembering that the wi&s;dom of man (to new modle God's laws, in or|der to pre&s;erve religion in the land) is fooli&s;hne&s;s with God, and only &s;erves to root religion out of the land. The&s;e ob&s;ervations duly con&s;idered, may &s;erve as a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to the objection.</P>
<P>As I am drawing near to a clo&s;e, I would remark, that probably two characters will in a &s;pecial manner &s;tigmati&s;e the other with all his performance&mdash;to wit:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The traditionated bigots who always think that their religious principles are right, and all others wrong.</P>
<P>Secondly. The peaceable who have &s;uch a great love for peace, that they can &s;tand and &s;ee truth trampled on and laid in the du&s;t, and peace as a tomb &s;tone laid on truth's grave, le&s;t truth &s;hould ari&s;e from the dead and make a di&s;turbance in the church; this la&s;t character not appearing to me as dangerous as the former. To &s;uch I would &s;ay, that God's attributes con&s;i&s;t of truth as well as peace: and where we find great regard for peace and truth, not equally regarded, we may then be a&s;&s;ured that &s;atan appears dre&s;&s;ed in the garb of peace preach|ing peace to the people. Mean time like a canker worm, is eating out the very vitals of truth, which is one e&s;&s;ential attribute of God; con&s;quently e&s;&s;ential to true religion. Moreover, Chri&s;t &s;aith, I am the truth: and the true church having Chri&s;t, they have the truth. Furthermore, Chri&s;t &s;ays, my peace I gave unto you. Now as Chri&s;t has bequeathed his truth and peace to the church, they cannot be divided
<PB N="47" REF="035671_0046_1006959AE191FE80">by the church. Moreover, this peace that Chri&s;t be|queathed, will cau&s;e divi&s;ion in the world: for Chri&s;t &s;aith, &s;uppo&s;e ye that I came to &s;end peace on the earth? I tell you nay! but rather divi&s;ion: but &s;atan is always oppo&s;ed to Chri&s;t; and if Chri&s;t came to &s;end divi&s;ion in the earth, then it follows that &s;atan &s;ends peace; Con&s;equently we find univer&s;al peace in the Gentile world, till Chri&s;t; the truth was preached by the Apo&s;|tle; and then tumultuous confu&s;ion en&s;ued; and if truth made &s;uch a di&s;turbance, then no doubt it will now have the &s;ame operation. Take heed then ye lo|vers of peace, and &s;ee whether your love for peace de|&s;cends from truth; for they always unite together; yea, marcy; truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace have met and ki&s;&s;ed each other, and you cannot love one of God's attributes without loving the whole; neither can you be influenced by one only, but by the whole. For as they all met in Chri&s;t, &s;o the benefits re&s;ulting there|from influence the &s;oul to love equally all that is in Chri&s;t, and all that de&s;cend from Chri&s;t: con&s;equent|ly, if the &s;pirit of God de&s;cends upon the Pre&s;byte|rian, congregational, or bapti&s;t churches, it will influ|ence tho&s;e churches to love each other, even although they do not &s;ee &s;o near alike as to join in full with each other; for every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him al&s;o that is begotten of him, and will unite all to|gether as brethren of one family, and &s;o far as any po&s;|&s;e&s;s this love, &s;o far they enjoy God and po&s;&s;e&s;s heaven. For God is love; con&s;equently all heaven is love: and this love is a di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic between the heirs of heaven and the heirs of hell. For Je&s;us &s;aith, by this &s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye love one another, and this love takes fa&s;t hold of truth, and will not let it go; yea, the &s;pirit of truth as proceeding from the father is promi&s;ed as the comfort|er. And where we find the &s;pirit of truth thus walk|ing our &s;treets, and frequenting our a&s;&s;emblies, there we &s;hall always find love and peace.</P>

<P>Finally, and to conclude, although they in this militant &s;tate, can &s;ee but in part, con&s;equently may differ injudgment re&s;pecting religious &s;entiments, and be di&s;tingui&s;hed by pre&s;byterian, congregational, or bapti&s;t, &amp;c. yet this love, peace and truth cemented together, will incite to honour, and prefer one another; and in a word, will unite all in a&s;cribing ble&s;&s;ing and honour, and glory and power, to him that &s;its upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever, which is the de&s;ire of him, who, for the rea&s;ons herein con|tained, has ab&s;ented him&s;elf from your a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
