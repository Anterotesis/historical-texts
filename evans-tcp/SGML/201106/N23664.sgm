<HEAD><HI>A LETTER</HI> TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE cau&s;e of Civil Liberty owes you much, and your country &s;till more; hitherto you have been con&s;idered as the man whom po&s;terity &s;hould hold up as an example to every people de|termined to be free.</P>
<P>Since the days of Columbus no man has appeared in a more con&s;picuous and dignified character&mdash;glory collected round you, and, for a while, like the &s;un in the centre of the univer&s;e, you influenced and attracted the admiration of mankind.</P>
<P>To what cau&s;es mu&s;t I attribute the alteration that has already taken place, in the &s;entiments of the world concerning you?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="031315_0003_0FEC0ABDC7053208">
Had the French revolution commenced ten years later, or you retired to the &s;hades of Mount Vernon four years ago, the friends of public virtue would &s;till proudly boa&s;t of one great man free from the breath of public di&s;prai&s;e, and your fondly partial country, forbearing to enquire whether or not you were chargable with private aberrations, would vaunt in you the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the phenix.</P>
<P>But it is to be feared that the temper of your mind has been mi&s;taken by all but tho&s;e who, uniting evil with ambitious di&s;po&s;itions, prevailed over your judgment to the prejudice of your reputation.</P>
<P>This is the tender opinion of men warmly attached to you: but it is al&s;o alleged that the world has ha&s;tily e&s;timated your character from imperfect materials, and your addre&s;s of the 17th of September is pro|duced as an evidence of the fact, and as a phenome|non in the political world even at this eventful era.</P>
<P>That production has excited the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite emotions: on one &s;ide a&s;toni&s;hment and affliction&mdash;on the other exultation and gladne&s;s: tho&s;e of the latter temper uniformly con&s;i&s;t of the avowed ene|mies of equal Liberty, the decided friends of mo|narchy, the open advocates of privileged and di&s;tinct cla&s;&s;es, but what above all &s;hould render &s;uch joy &s;u&s;picious to you, is, that none are more loud than that numerous body among us, who, after embrewing their patricidal hands in the blood of our parents, relatives, and friends, were yet admitted in the ge|nerous moment of our victory to a participation of that freedom which they had laboured to de&s;troy, and upon equal terms with tho&s;e who achieved it!&mdash;When all the&s;e, and the&s;e only rejoice and extol your addre&s;s to the &s;kies, I need not &s;ay who mourn in &s;ilence and &s;hame!</P>
<P>You are not in&s;en&s;ible of that e&s;timation in which you have been hitherto held by foreign nations, nor of the celebrity you were likely to obtain in hi&s;tory,
<PB N="5" REF="031315_0004_0FEC0AC106D18B60">neither have you been indifferent to fame; you know better than any other man the ju&s;t extent of your claims to the affections of your country, and you cannot be in&s;en&s;ible how full the mea&s;ure of gra|titude has been with which you have been con&s;tantly repaid.</P>
<P>It is among the amiable errors of our nature, and already appears a too prominent feature in the cha|racter of our countrymen, to carry the generous &s;en&s;e of gratitude for great &s;ervices, and admiration of &s;plendid actions, into the extremes of confidence and devotion&mdash;to pro&s;trate rea&s;on at the altar of blind and undi&s;criminating affections, and to &s;acrifice or for&s;ake principles at the in&s;tigations of zeal; thus it is that men, &s;uffering veneration to mi&s;lead their judgment, learn to &s;anctify frailties and vices.</P>
<P>This temper &s;o innocent in its &s;ource, all hi&s;tory proves to have been mo&s;t dangerous to the happine&s;s of nations; the influence of power in corrupting the human heart, is univer&s;ally acknowleged; how few of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it are there, that can learn to doubt the wi&s;dom of their own mea&s;ures, or to com|pute for them&s;elves upon rules which they pro&s;cribe for the adoption of mankind; in vain do we cheri&s;h in remembrance the magnaninity that called Cin|cinnatus from the plough, if we forget the cau&s;e and manner of his departure from Rome.</P>
<P>That you have lo&s;t &s;ome &s;hare of your glorious celebrity is not to be denied, but lamented;&mdash;and as different pa&s;&s;ions prevail various cau&s;es will be a&s;|&s;igned for this extrordinary decadence:&mdash;it is a &s;ub|ject in which your country is mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly intere&s;ted, &s;ince it may ultimately influence her degeneracy or Freedom.</P>
<P>You know that the obligations which bind the citizen to his country peri&s;h at the moment he cea&s;es to be free;&mdash;you know that as all men are equally intere&s;ted in that Freedom, &s;o perpetual watchfulne&s;s
<PB N="6" REF="031315_0005_0FEC0AC2C0607F20">is equally the duty of every individual, in the hour wherein he conceives there is danger:&mdash;the afflicti|ons of nations are laid in remote cau&s;es, it is a mat|ter of opinion until it begins to operate, he who thinks he perceives the germ of a plague is bound to explore it, that men may be aware of their danger.</P>
<P>Your addre&s;s in my mind is fraught with incalcu|lable evils to your country!&mdash;</P>
<P>It affords a mo&s;t &s;erious le&s;&s;on indeed to the people of America, and to every other nation who <HI>may yet have to adopt a model</HI> in realizing their Liberties.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t acknowledge it painful&mdash;it is difficult to di&s;cu&s;s your &s;entiments while the affections would fain palliate and commute the failings of age, and the errors of a virtuous man perhaps deceived, for &s;ub&s;tantial ble&s;&s;ings and benefits &s;ecured under better au&s;pices.</P>
<P>But Truth and Liberty, which are not the crea|tures of a day or a generation, will not &s;anction that weakne&s;s akin to vice, which would throw a veil over the errors even of the mo&s;t perfect of mankind; ju&s;tice however calls upon me to declare, that by me and every true American, your cour&s;e of public con|duct has always been viewed with the tendere&s;t par|tiality; too young to have per&s;onally &s;hared in the hazards and glories of the revolution, I am not yet &s;o young as not to have partaken of its cares and anx|ieties, and of that dear and durable &s;ympathy which is the concommitant of an intere&s;t in great perils and great achievements. In the li&s;ping le&s;&s;ons of infan|cy and in the ardency of youth, we learned from the amiable prai&s;es of our mothers to lean fondly on your name; and the &s;tranger who flies from the bondage and oppre&s;&s;ion of Europe, hourly hears in the prevailing themes of dome&s;tic di&s;cour&s;e and the le&s;&s;ons we teach our children, how clo&s;ely the affec|tions of America cling around you. Yes! Sir; Truth uncon&s;trained but always ju&s;t mu&s;t place you
<PB N="7" REF="031315_0006_0FEC0AC46A787B78">in an exalted rank among the great men whom hi&s;to|ry celebrates for the imitation of po&s;terity: But Truth di&s;owns a homage to your errors.</P>
<P>In paying a fair and hone&s;t tribute of acknowleg|ment to your private and public virtues, exten&s;ive in no common degree, you will perceive that I know the nature of the ground upon which I &s;tand, while I venture from retirement, and without the &s;anction of a name, to que&s;tion your mea&s;ures, and to di&s;play with bold but candid freedom what I &s;ee or think I &s;ee therein&mdash;of an alarming and pernicious tendency; to examine and di&s;play &s;entiments of yours, which I deem incon&s;i&s;tent with your&s;elf, incompatible with the profe&s;&s;ed &s;incerity of your character, and repug+nant to the pure&s;t maxims of liberality, wi&s;dom, and morals.</P>
<P>Deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e feelings, on the fir&s;t peru&s;al of your addre&s;s, I determined to await the return of calmer emotions, till &s;urprize and appre|hen&s;ion &s;hould abate: cool reflection and mature de|liberation have &s;trengthened the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions; I re&s;olved to await the public determination, expect|ing to hear opinion flowing from ignorant but hone&s;t affection, or ha&s;tening on the wings of &s;ervility or party adulation, from all quarters of the Union;&mdash;but the period is arrived when your addre&s;s has com|pleted the tour of the States &mdash; I &s;top to mark the awful and emphatic &s;ilence! &mdash; Excepting the mer|cenary and inane cant of book&s;ellers, and the &s;olita|ry voice of tho&s;e who <HI>"venture to approach you!"</HI> from <HI>Shepherds-town,</HI> a di&s;mal &s;ullen &s;ilence prevails! even the the public papers con&s;picuous for their abject and humiliating prai&s;e, or on the other &s;ide for freedom and licenteou&s;ne&s;s, have alike maintained the &s;ame &s;urprizing and &s;u&s;picious forbearance!</P>
<P>Certainly there mu&s;t have been &s;ome potent cau&s;e to produce from &s;uch di&s;cordant a&s;&s;imilations one uni|form and continued &s;ilence &mdash; has it not forced a
<PB N="8" REF="031315_0007_0FEC0AC60DEE6BE8">&s;igh from from your bo&s;om, and told your unwilling apprehen&s;ions <HI>there is &s;omething wrong!</HI></P>
<P>Would to God you had obeyed the internal moni|tor that prompted your too wavering &s;en&s;e to &s;peak that faithful but ineffectual truth,&mdash;<HI>"Here perhaps I ought to &s;top!"</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;ident's Addre&s;s Ormrod's Edition P. 6.</NOTE>: the &s;incere effu&s;ions of tenderne&s;s, untinged by party colouring and irritation, would be trea&s;ured up for ever and transferred without guile to our children, who&s;e morning ori&s;ons &s;hould be, <Q>uncea&s;ing vows to heaven to continue the choice&s;t tokens of beneficence,</Q> which you wi&s;hed us <Q>in the free con&s;titution the work of your hands&mdash;that its admini&s;tration in every department may be &s;tamped with wi&s;dom and virtue&mdash;that in fine the happine&s;s of the people in tho&s;e &s;tates, under the au&s;pices of LIBERTY may be complete by &s;o careful a pre&s;ervation and &s;o prudent a u&s;e of this ble&s;&s;ing, as will acquire to them the glory of <HI>recommending it to every nation which is yet a &s;tranger to it.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Had you &s;topped there, partiality would have &s;trove to bury, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree the remem|brance of certain truths out of re&s;pect to you;&mdash;but the &s;ub&s;equent pages of your addre&s;s demand the examination which is the purpo&s;e of this letter: I at fir&s;t propo&s;ed to convey my remarks to you in a private manner; but con&s;idering the foundation of the evil effects which I apprehend from your addre&s;s, as already laid, I have judged it more proper to lay them before the people who are alone e&s;&s;enti|ally concerned.</P>
<P>You are &s;o &s;trongly fixed in the affections of the greater part of my fellow citizens, and not without great right, except in that dangerous extreme which leads to imbibing the effects of your prejudices as the re&s;ults of wi&s;dom, that I can expect to find but a minority willing to examine di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately the
<PB N="9" REF="031315_0008_0FEC0AD1182A2070">ob&s;ervations which I offer: neverthele&s;s, it would ill become me on &s;uch an occa&s;ion to &s;hrink from the &s;en&s;e of duty &mdash; &s;ince my opinions, if erroneous, are open to refutation, and can do you no injury; but in expre&s;&s;ing them I &s;hall &s;peak with the frankne&s;s of a Freeman, I &s;hall not couch my &s;entiments under a treacherous garb of words &s;u&s;ceptible of a double interpretation &mdash;a conduct that would ill become any man in a ju&s;t cau&s;e, but particularly in his own cau&s;e or that of the public.</P>
<P>Your addre&s;s, exclu&s;ive of that excellent intro|duction compo&s;ing the fir&s;t &s;ix pages, where you ought to have &s;topped, principally con&s;i&s;ts of three branches, generally connected, but requiring for per&s;picuity's &s;ake a di&s;tinct examination.</P>

<P>On the fir&s;t of the&s;e heads you te&s;tify to the ar|dency of the national affection for Freedom, and ju&s;tly con&s;ider the unity of the government as a main pillar of our independence&mdash;of our internal tranquillity and external &s;ecurity&mdash;of our peace and pro&s;perity&mdash;and of that Liberty we &s;o highly prize; but from that point to the conclu&s;ion, there prevails a &s;pirit of ambiguity and recrimination, blended with maxims good and evil, that are at variance with each other and that magnanimity and openne&s;s which would be&s;peak con&s;cious virtue and become the true friend of Freedom; &mdash; which &s;hould never be for|&s;aken by the moral man and the hero of a free nation when dictating <HI>le&s;&s;ens profe&s;&s;edly for the advantage of his fellow citizens, and calculated to make a &s;trong and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion"&mdash;"to moderate the fury of party rage"</HI>&mdash;"to warn again&s;t the mi&s;chief of foreign intrigues"&mdash;and "to guard again&s;t the <HI>impo&s;tures</HI> of <HI>pretended</HI> Patriot|i&s;m!"</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="031315_0009_0FEC0AD2AEF83350">
It is fit in this place to call to remembrance, that during the early part of your public life, candor has been the avowed rule of your public and private con|duct, and it is from that engaging quality above all others you have derived the unlimitted confidence of your country and the re&s;pect of other nations; not &s;o much from being con&s;picuous in you, but becau&s;e duplicity and re&s;erve, &s;elf-&s;ufficiency and &s;ecrecy, have been heretofore the cloaks which covered the wily mi&s;chiefs of politicians in all the governments of the old world.</P>
<P>Within the la&s;t four years, at a period which is a&s;|certainable, but needing now no particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion &s;ince it will live in hi&s;tory, you departed from that precious rule, and the procedure and language of old politicians and politics have pervaded all your mea|&s;ures &s;ince. I &s;hall barely notice one tran&s;action, &s;ince that alone is a &s;ufficient evidence of the conduct to which I allude, and affords an example that &s;hould be a con&s;tant warning to Freemen how they repo&s;e exten&s;ive power in the hands of any indivi|dual, however dignified by his &s;ervices or patrioti&s;m, for any con&s;iderable length of time: I mean your refu&s;al to grant to the ju&s;t wi&s;hes of <HI>the people's repre|&s;entatives,</HI> to the joint wi&s;hes of <HI>hoth hou&s;es,</HI> a peru&s;al of papers concerning the people's own affairs, and for whom you &s;hould not have forgot you were but a re&s;pon&s;ible agent. I am aware, that under the fatal forms of <HI>&s;tate &s;ecrecy, privilege of office,</HI> or powers a&s;|&s;umed to belong to the pre&s;idential character, which in fact are neither more nor le&s;s than the wor&s;t en|graftments from <HI>Machiavelian policy,</HI> and the actual e&s;&s;ence of <HI>monarchical prerogative;</HI> this conduct is affected to be ju&s;tified, but by &s;uch frail di&s;gui&s;es and foul advi&s;ers you have been betrayed to withhold the corre&s;pondence on the Briti&s;h Treaty, &mdash;to treat your country as an enemy, whom you wi&s;hed to overcome by &s;tratagem, and like a &s;kilful general
<PB N="11" REF="031315_0010_0FEC0AD504397778">in the career of &s;ucce&s;s, dictated conditions which degraded the &s;ubjugated by leaving them the &s;hew of deliberation without the means to deliberate, &mdash; when the conditions of &s;urrender were already irre|vocable! But from that fatal moment, when you li&s;tened to the &s;eductions of your deadlie&s;t enemies, in oppo&s;ition to the voice of Freedom which hates di&s;gui&s;e, the brightne&s;s of your countenance is &s;aid to have faded, the glory that &s;hone round you di&s;|&s;olved in mi&s;t, and like our fir&s;t parents, you have borne about you the vi&s;ible evidences of internal regret, and the perturbations of virtue &s;truggling between pride and con&s;cious error; from that unhap|py hour the enemies of Liberty and your Country called you <HI>their own,</HI> and the name of WASHINGTON &s;unk from the elevated rank of the SOLONS and LYCURGUSES to the in&s;ignificance of a <HI>Venetian Doge</HI> or a <HI>Dutch Stadtholder!</HI></P>
<P>On that baleful day, the boa&s;ted candor, the dig|nified openne&s;s, the communicative di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of patrioti&s;m, became more than equivocal, and the clouds of &s;u&s;picion hovered round you; American politics became di&s;coloured with the jaundiced hue of de&s;poti&s;m and cabinet cunning, and the world was brought once more to look upon the con&s;tant declaration of your mo&s;t vociferous panegyri&s;ts, that "<HI>pure</HI> republicani&s;m is a <HI>fiction,</HI>" as a fatal truth, and the American States but as one more of tho&s;e ma|chines calculated for management of a capricious or weak individual; the popular repre&s;entation from that period lo&s;t is re&s;pectability, and was degraded into the character of an old French Parliament, kept only for the mere ceremony of receiving implicitly and regi&s;tering without the toleration of enquiry the <HI>edicts which the &s;overeign wills.</HI></P>
<P>But a more fatal effect re&s;ults from this mea&s;ure, in the precedent held out to your &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who&s;e ambition may not be circum&s;cribed by age or the
<PB N="12" REF="031315_0011_0FEC0AD69CF8EA78">want of heirs, nor by the yet vigorous hatred which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts upon experience again&s;t the evils of de&s;po|ti&s;m: earne&s;tly as you warn your country again&s;t the dangers to be apprehended from de&s;poti&s;m through faction, you in this in&s;tance left a breach, at which ambition may enter with trifold force and facility, where entrenched behind the authority of your exam|ple, and aided by pliant in&s;truments in public &s;ituati|ons (which it is feared our country already affords) they may machinate treaties and maintain corre&s;pon|dences, which in their con&s;equences may produce all the calamity in which weak or wicked ambitious men can involve a notion.</P>
<P>Great labor is vi&s;ible in the con&s;truction of your language!&mdash;I have not been an inattentive or a light ob&s;erver of the concerns of my country, yet I find it not ea&s;y to fix upon the de&s;cription of men to whom you allude in that &s;entence&mdash; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 6.</NOTE> <Q>it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that from different quarters pains will be taken, and artifices employed to weaken in our minds the conviction, that union is the bond of our &s;afety;</Q> and again <Q>frowning upon the fir&s;t dawn of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the re&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>There have been in&s;tances in which the &s;peculati|ons of philo&s;ophy have glanced at the future divi&s;i|on of America into a variety of &s;tates, <HI>M. Linguet</HI> and the <HI>Abbe Raynal</HI> a&s;&s;umed to predict &s;uch an event ere yet we became an independent nation.</P>
<P>Great Britain has in her &s;y&s;tem of colonization and policy, &s;peculated upon tho&s;e &s;peculations, and tran&s;|fu&s;ed the &s;pirit into her colonial arrangments in Canada; Dorche&s;ter and Simcoe acted upon it; and the Briti&s;h mini&s;ters and &s;enate have argued upon the de&s;irablene&s;s and practicability of dividing the Uni|ted States into di&s;tinct governments and intere&s;ts, to
<PB N="13" REF="031315_0012_0FEC0ADA8BD2FA40">be regulated by climate, &s;ituation, the <HI>natural lines of population,</HI> productions, manners, and <HI>religions,</HI> and all the genera of theoretic circum&s;tance; but in the&s;e con&s;i&s;ts the difficulty which prevents my mind from fixing upon the per&s;ons or party from who&s;e ef|forts <HI>you</HI> apprehend tho&s;e dangers to the Union; for when I compare the conduct you di&s;played on the &s;ubjects of Briti&s;h politics and connections, with the&s;e lively warnings, I cannot bring my&s;elf to believe that you could implicate that party in the dangers you deprecate; and what &s;till di&s;tracts my judgment in endeavouring to di&s;cover to whom you allude, are the &s;trange and &s;triking circum&s;tances, that the per&s;ons among our&s;elves who are loude&s;t in declara|tions of attachment to our country, are yet the con|&s;tant and faithful inmates and advocates of Briti&s;h men and mea&s;ures, are tho&s;e who attempted openly and argumentively to recommend, and as it were prove, the nece&s;&s;ity and utility of dividing the United States into two republics, to con&s;i&s;t of the New-En|gland &s;tates North and Ea&s;tward, and the other of all the Southern &s;tates; but it is not this effort of theirs, nor their ince&s;&s;ant clamour in favour of all things Briti&s;h and again&s;t all things French, that di&s;|tracts and leaves my opinion un&s;ettled, but that per|&s;ons very clo&s;ely in your confidence, openly profe&s;s and defend the&s;e attachments; that this party com|po&s;e your mo&s;t ardent eulogi&s;ts; that they are like|wi&s;e the con&s;tant and no le&s;s ardent eulogi&s;ts of privi|leged orders, the advocates of an e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, and the eulogi&s;ts of a Briti&s;h form of government&mdash;Bri&s;ti&s;h maxims in morals as well as politics are with them the &s;tandard of human perfection, of which they do not he&s;itate to declare you to be a living ex|ample formed upon a &s;uperior model.</P>
<P>I cannot therefore con&s;i&s;tently conclude that this party with whom you &s;tand &s;o high, and who have partaken it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed very largely of your pri|vate
<PB N="14" REF="031315_0013_0FEC0AE428AF15B8">regards for three years pa&s;t, could have been the objects of your warnings, however pointedly and circum&s;tantially the de&s;cription may be applied to them.</P>
<P>There remains indeed the &s;hadow of a &s;urmi&s;e yet to notice; per&s;ons in the we&s;tern countries it has been &s;aid, expre&s;&s;ed in the moment when they deemed them&s;elves aggrieved, the idea of &s;eparation, to e&s;|cape oppre&s;&s;ion&mdash;a mo&s;t memorable occa&s;ion! &s;hould they be indeed the &s;erious objects upon which you affect alarm, the veil of ambiguity is no longer impe|netrable, and it remains only to be a&s;ked how their circum&s;tances and population ju&s;tify the fear? Who are their foreign neighbors? What advantage could they derive in effecting &s;uch a purpo&s;e? And what motive could be &s;ufficiently &s;trong to urge them to &s;uch a mea&s;ure?</P>
<P>The&s;e que&s;tions require no diffu&s;ive rea&s;onings no deep re&s;earch,&mdash;that their population is inadequate to &s;upport independence&mdash;their re&s;ources incompe|tent to their wants in &s;uch a &s;ituation, the plain under|&s;tanding of the plaine&s;t man could determine; but you &s;ay <Q>be deaf to &s;uch as would &s;ever you from your brethren and connect you with <HI>aliens,</HI></Q>&mdash;the&s;e aliens mu&s;t be their neighbours, of whom we have rea&s;on to be jealous?

<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t on the preci&s;ion of dates where facts are notorious; a &s;hort time prior to the agitation of the Briti&s;h Treaty, it &s;hould not be forgotten, that the Briti&s;h Cabinet had i&s;&s;ued a &s;ecret order to their crui&s;ers to &s;eize all American ve&s;&s;els which they &s;hould meet bound for France, that &s;ome hundreds of them were actually &s;eized before the exi&s;tence of &s;uch an order was known to our government, that the &s;ame period produced the denunciation again&s;t the <HI>republican form of govern|ment;</HI> it &s;hould likewi&s;e be well remembered that, at that period the French were reduced to a predi|cament wherein an accumulation of internal cala|mities and an unexampled combination of external force appeared, in the opinion of weak men, ready to overwhelm that people and &s;ink them in the &s;cale of nations for ever; the mode of her partition had already been <HI>formally agreed upon and guaranteed,</HI> and England eternally babbling on the balance of pow|er and her faith in treaties&mdash;&s;urrendered the&s;e max|ims

<P>The &s;eizure of our &s;hipping, the &s;ale of our car|goes, the detention of our &s;eamen, the ruin of our trade, after &s;ome time attracted the attention of our executive&mdash;(and here it is but equitable to a&s;k

<P>That treaty was the price of your fears and of the We&s;tern po&s;ts&mdash;and the &s;acrifice of our relations with France was the return for the repeal of the Briti&s;h order of council, but without the effect of relea&s;ing us from the obloquy of Briti&s;h violence and barbarity at &s;ea.</P>

But it has been urged by trimming politicians, that as England now holds the dominion of the &s;ea, we owe it to our&s;elves to cultivate peace with her, &s;ince her trade employs our &s;hipping, and her manufac|tures engro&s;s three-fifths of our internal traffic&mdash; by this mode of argument it is, that the recommen|dation of adherence to the faith of Treaties, and a &s;teady a&s;&s;ertion of national independence and neutra|lity, have been made odious by avarice and faction. and bellowed forth only as the treacherous whoop prelu&s;ive of war.</P>
<P>Such were the proceedings and &s;uch the mode of argument, that ju&s;tified and effectuated the Briti&s;h alliance; I will not &s;top to remark minutely how powerfully all the arguments again&s;t the attachment to France might be employed again&s;t that with Bri|tain, it will be enough to &s;tate the general circum|&s;tances of each; the government of Britain is a &s;ub|ject de&s;erving the decided abhorrence of every moral man; that of France is repre&s;entative like our own; the perfidious policy of the former will con&s;tantly endanger us, if not ultimately involve us with one or other of the European powers whom &s;he hates or fears; in a commercial view &s;he will be nece&s;&s;arily dependant on us, for out &s;taples and the con&s;umption of her fabrics, which we can procure cheaper in other countries; France can have nothing to fear from our enmity nor to court from our warme&s;t love, her population and the genius of her people will enable her to under&s;ed all the manufacturers of Europe, and trade will follow cheapne&s;s; England on the contrary deriving all her con&s;equence from abroad, and daily &s;inking under the burden of her ambitious, oppre&s;&s;ive, and corrupt government at home, cannot hope for future pro&s;perity or re&s;pectability in Europe, only in a Revolution and Republican government (an event that would render your mea&s;ures perfectly ridiculous) or by wily machinations drawing in America, as

<P>In the trembling anxiety of your apprehen&s;ions you betray a &s;olicitude for the exculpation of your pa&s;t conduct, that &s;peaks more than the mo&s;t minute examination of your &s;entiments; having mentioned the Briti&s;h treaty with applau&s;e, you recollect in the &s;equel that you have deprecated foreign alliances: you therefore find it nece&s;&s;ary to create the di&s;tincti|on between commercial and political alliances, as if the former were not to all intents and purpo&s;es of the latter de&s;cription, when the privileges of a fa|vored nation are &s;acrificed on one &s;ide, and in&s;ult and oppre&s;&s;ion &s;ubmitted to on the other; but fearful that even this &s;hould be in&s;ufficient you further warn us again&s;t <Q><HI>permanent alliances,</HI> &s;o far I mean as we are now at liberty to do it, for let me not be under|as capable of <HI>patronizing</HI> infidelity to exi&s;ting en|gagements.</Q> This extrordinary advice is fully ex|emplified in your departure from the &s;pirit and prin|ciple of the treaty with France, which was declared to be permanent, and exhibits this very infidelity you reprobate in a mo&s;t &s;triking and lamentable light.</P>
<P>In forming the treaty with Britain, one of two modes of conduct was pur&s;ued, equally regardle&s;s of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting obligations; there was either a relinqui&s;h|ment

<P>There was &s;till another circum&s;tance of particular delicacy in negociating the Briti&s;h treaty, which a Republic jealous of her reputation, as the mo&s;t vir|ruous woman, &s;hould not have neglected;&mdash;that the negociation was commenced and concluded during the exi&s;tence of a war between the mo&s;t favored nati|on in alliance with America, and the former enemy of America, then at war with the mo&s;t favored nati|on; <HI>under all the&s;e circum&s;tances</HI> it &s;hould appear to be a mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation on America not to accede to any conditions propo&s;ed by Britain incom|patible with tho&s;e already enjoyed by France&mdash;or at lea&s;t if America granted <HI>all</HI> that France enjoyed, to grant <HI>no more.</HI></P>
<P>Whether the que&s;tion on neutral bottoms was ever di&s;cu&s;&s;ed or not, is a matter not now to be exa|mined, but &s;peaking in the &s;pirit of charitable for|bearance, the ignorance, or indifference, or imbecili|ty,

<P>The principles that lead men to virtue &s;hould be well under&s;tood by Freemen, if Freedom is a ble&s;&s;|ing and Slavery a cur&s;e, then whatever conduces to the Freedom of Man is Virtue:&mdash;Is the love of Liberty implanted in our nature or not?

<P>Religion &s;hould be kept apart from politics;&mdash; temporal e&s;tabli&s;hments are never bettered by &s;pirit|ual influence; they have always corrupted each other, and &s;lavery has been the fate of all who have fallen within their united jurisdiction: &s;trange that while

Equally objectionable are your doctrines when you declare <Q>it is not for one nation to expect di&s;intere&s;ted favors from another;</Q> this al&s;o &s;trikes at the root of morals, and is founded on the baleful examples of the wor&s;t governments, and the &s;uppo&s;ed depravity of man; but altho our conduct towards France too forcibly maintains the affirmative, I cannot admit the maxim to be any other than Machiavelian, di&s;proved by various exam|ples from hi&s;tory, and in a very forcible manner by France, which, in be&s;towing &s;omething more than what you &s;trangely term <HI>nominal favors,</HI> and a&s;king of us no &s;acrifice in return, as &s;he ju&s;tly might have done, may very fairly reproach us for having given NO MORE THAN <HI>"the equivalents of nominal favors!"</HI>&mdash; for real benefits be&s;towed.</P>
<P>But, Sir, "in the duty of holding a neutral po|&s;ition" your country and France her&s;elf and the world at large agreed, that it was a ju&s;tly <Q>predo|minant motive with you to gain time to our coun|try to &s;ettle and mature its recent in&s;titutions, and to progre&s;s without interruption to that de|gree of &s;trength and con&s;i&s;tency which is nece&s;&s;ary to give it, humanly &s;peaking, the command of its fortunes;</Q> and the&s;e were truly powerful arguments that called upon you for a rigid adhe|rence to the neutral principle.</P>
