<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with no &s;mall degree of diffidence that I &s;it down to expo&s;e and controvert the fal&s;e rea&s;oning in a late publication called "The Age of Rea&s;on;" e&s;pecially as the author of it has ri&s;en to a very high degree of eminence by two very popular productions, de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed&mdash;"COMMON SENSE," and the "RIGHTS OF MAN;"&mdash;and e&s;pecially con&s;idering that the fame of the two la&s;t mentioned works may probably bias the public opinion in favor of the <HI>"Age of Rea&s;on."</HI> But Mr. Paine's attempt to invalidate the divine authority of revealed religion, reminds me of what befel one of the greate&s;t geniu&s;es for carica|ture, that Europe ever produced&mdash;I mean Hogarth the painter. Hogarth was eminent in the line of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, but he needs mu&s;t turn poet; and he doubt|le&s;s expected to excel in that al&s;o. Churchill (who was born a poet) convinced him of his error, by ex|po&s;ing his bad ver&s;es in &s;o ludicrous a manner, that Hogarth, vexed, di&s;appointed, and mortified to a great degree, did not long &s;urvive the &s;hock he had received. Well would it be, were Me&s;&s;rs. Hogarth and Paine the only lamentable in&s;tances of the eccen|tric vanity and folly even of men of genius, when, leaving their own proper &s;phere, they meddle with what they are not properly acquainted with, and by no means competent for.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine's "AGE OF REASON" has been in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;wered, and &s;o far refuted, by the author of a little pamphlet which lately appeared, called "The Folly of Rea&s;on, being our perfect and unerring guide to the knowledge of true religion:" but I wi&s;h he had de&s;cended to &s;ome other particulars; or that &s;ome per&s;on, of more lei&s;ure and greater at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> than
<PB N="iv" REF="030423_0003_0FE6D0864021D428">I have, had &s;tepped forth and &s;upplied the deficiency. I am per&s;uaded this might ea&s;ily have been done in a ma&s;terly manner by many of our clergy, of every de|nomination: but as Mr. Paine and other dei&s;ts are mo&s;t unrea&s;onably prejudiced again&s;t even the <HI>good</HI> and <HI>hone&s;t</HI> part of the clergy&mdash;nay even again&s;t the whole of them, of every nation and every church.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That too many bad men (perhaps &s;ome of them dei&s;ts, or athei&s;ts) got into the prie&s;thood&mdash;e&s;pecially in countries where high preferments and emoluments were annexed to the profe&s;&s;i|on&mdash;is a lamentable truth. And that kings and princes &s;hould endeavour to gain the intere&s;t and &s;upport of the&s;e men, is no way &s;urprizing. Indeed what is there valuable on earth, which great men have not endeavoured to engro&s;s, that it might contri|bute to their aggrandizement? But is religion, or are talents, riches, or any thing which contributes to the comfort and conve|nience of life, le&s;s to be valued on that account? Certainly not. The &s;ame &s;un, which enlivens and enlightens nature, directs the pirate, the highwayman, and the murderer to the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes; and the hou&s;e-breaker and adulterer take advantage of the light of the moon, to guide them in the execution of their fell purpo&s;e. Gold may be employed to corrupt the friend, or the patriot&mdash;hire the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in&mdash;or betray innocence: But &s;hall we therefore de&s;pi&s;e gold, or refu&s;e the light of the &s;un and moon? By no means.
<P>Riches, in the hands of a good man, are a valuable ble&s;&s;ing: they enable him to promote u&s;eful in&s;titutions: to feed the hun|gry, clothe the naked, and relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. In the hands of bad men, what ble&s;&s;ing is there which has not been pervert|ed? Law, government, phy&s;ic, the gift of &s;peech, the arts of writing and printing; and even liberty, &s;acred liberty! they have turned into licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>That there have been great numbers of the clergy, in &s;ome countries, who have been men of blamele&s;s and exemplary lives, and adorned the go&s;pel by their conduct and the effect of their di&s;courses, no one can deny. In oppo&s;ition to this worthy cla&s;s of men, there always have been, and it is to be feared will conti|nue to be, men of corrupt hearts and morals in every &s;tation of life: but rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e &s;ay, that doubtle&s;s we ought to di&s;criminate.</P></NOTE> And as Mr. Paine has attacked religion with only scuffs, puerile je&s;ts, and bold a&s;&s;ertions without proofs&mdash;they might probably think his publication almo&s;t below
<PB N="v" REF="030423_0004_0FE6D0864CF250D8">contempt, and unworthy their &s;erious animadver&s;ions&mdash;at lea&s;t from the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>The following e&s;&s;ay being compo&s;ed by a layman, the fruit of long enquiry and full conviction&mdash;mu&s;t obviate one of the &s;tronge&s;t objections of the dei&s;ts. I will therefore ca&s;t in my mite&mdash;as perhaps in duty bound.</P>
<P>I have neither lei&s;ure nor inclination to follow Mr. Paine in all his cavils and windings; &s;ome of them are &s;o futile, &s;o full of bare a&s;&s;ertion, and buffoonery, as to be an an&s;wer to them&s;elves, &s;atisfactory enough to every intelligent per&s;on. But I &s;hall endeavour to an&s;wer every objection worth an&s;wering; and, I hope, in &s;uch a manner as to &s;atisfy the &s;erious, the candid, and unprejudiced reader. As to the would-be-critics, and witlings, all I have to &s;ay to them is, That it was not the hope of their approbation that prompted me to write this e&s;&s;ay; nor will their frowns ever pre|vent my attempting what I think is right.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to method and &s;tyle, I well know that this e&s;&s;ay will &s;tand in need of much indulgence from the <HI>true</HI> critics: and as candour, and a readine&s;s to ob&s;erve the good intentions of any author, and the merits as well as demerits of any production, is always found with them&mdash;I humbly hope from that quarter, e&s;pecially when I declare that this is the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay I ever attempted,&mdash;that it was compo&s;ed at broken in|tervals of time, after attending to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day&mdash;that my literary education is very confined&mdash;and that I purpo&s;ely &s;tudied plainne&s;s and &s;implicity of &s;tyle, that the work might be rendered more generally u&s;eful to that cla&s;s of readers for whom it is more im|mediately intended.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious, therefore, of the rectitude of my inten|tions, I addre&s;s my&s;elf to my book: "Go, little in|fant, and plead the cau&s;e of truth and virtue!&mdash;Thy enemies may be numerous, but be not thou di&s;mayed. A few friends thou wilt unque&s;tionably find among&s;t
<PB N="vi" REF="030423_0005_0FE6D091479208B8">the lovers of candour and religion, notwith&s;tanding thy ru&s;tic appearance; and it is the friend&s;hip of the&s;e which thy father is mo&s;t &s;olicitous thou &s;houlde&s;t cul|tivate&mdash;With this hope he &s;ends thee into the world; and commits thee to the guardian&s;hip of an Arm all-powerful."</P>
<P>&dtristar; This work was written in 1794, in a &s;tyle and manner &s;omewhat new, but being the author's fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, his unaffected diffidence prevented its coming forward till now, encouraged by a few intelligent friends.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>"The reas'ning art, to various ends apply'd,</L>
<L>"Is oft a &s;ure&mdash;but oft an erring guide."</L>
<BIBL>&mdash;<HI>Pope.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MR. Keatinge, in his "Folly of Rea&s;on," has at lea&s;t proved the in&s;ufficiency of Human Rea&s;on, in its pre&s;ent imperfect and depraved &s;tate, being "our perfect and unerring guide to the know|ledge of <HI>true</HI> religion:" and I &s;hall only beg leave to add, that what we commonly call <HI>rea&s;on</HI> in man, is only a rea&s;oning faculty, which may be mi&s;informed a thou&s;and ways, and bia&s;&s;ed by ten thou&s;and motives, but e&s;pecially by love, or the chief de&s;ire of the heart. What has human rea&s;on done, in the knowledge of theology, among&s;t the Hottentots at the Cape of Good Hope? among&s;t the Indians, and many other nations of rea&s;oning mortals, where the light of di|vine revelation has never appeared? Witne&s;s Athens, &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated for human &s;cience and literature&mdash;what fools, or wor&s;e than fools, they were in true the|ology! Nay, even (how unlike our modern philo&s;o|phers!) they them&s;elves confe&s;&s;ed their own ignorance, by dedicating one of their altars <HI>"To the unknown God;"</HI>&mdash;though, in fact, this was the mo&s;t rational act of devotion they had ever performed.</P>
<P>Whatever Dei&s;ts may think, mankind &s;tood in ab|&s;olute need of a revelation, in addition to what is generally called the light of nature, or the knowledge ari&s;ing from that part of true theology which contem|plates the glorious fabric of the univer&s;e, its creation, wonderful harmony, and pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that mankind, in their fallen, corrupted &s;tate, were either incapable, or not de&s;irous,
<PB N="8" REF="030423_0007_0FE6D092B70B81C8">of &s;tudying natural religion (if I may &s;o expre&s;s my|&s;elf) and fell into a thou&s;and ab&s;urdities re&s;pecting the object of adoration, and the manner of wor&s;hipping the Great Fir&s;t Cau&s;e of all things; and that the infi|nitely wi&s;e Creator, in compa&s;&s;ion to their weakne&s;s, gave them in his own good time (gradually, and in &s;uch a mea&s;ure as they were capable of receiving it) an expre&s;s revelation by angels; by men, whom they could hear at lei&s;ure, and conver&s;e with as brethren, and who proved the divinity of their mi&s;&s;ion by a&s;to|ni&s;hing miracles, performed by a word, and frequently in the pre&s;ence, not of a few individuals only, but of whole cities and nations; and, when the&s;e failed of their intended effect, God &s;ent his Son into the world, who united with his divine nature that perfect moral image of God which mankind had lo&s;t in Adam; and in this &s;en&s;e, he might very properly be called the &s;econd Adam, or repre&s;entative of the human race&mdash;the fir&s;t repre&s;entative having, through di&s;obedience, "Brought death into the world, and all our woe;" and tho&s;e forfeited rights being now to be recovered and re&s;tored by the obedience of the &s;econd.</P>
<P>To maintain the honor of the moral government of the Deity&mdash;to di&s;play his &s;tupendous love to man&mdash;and to enjoy the godlike luxury (if I may &s;o call it) of redeeming millions from darkne&s;s, &s;lavery, and death eternal, I &s;ee no impropriety or inju&s;tice in Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;uffering the penalty due to others.&mdash;As God, he knew all things, and was well acquainted with the terms of his errand.&mdash;As man, this great philanthro|phi&s;t "for the joy that was &s;et before him," gave him|&s;elf a voluntary &s;acrifice, and cheerfully &s;ubmitted even to death it&s;elf, that by his re&s;urrection and a&s;cen|&s;ion he might exalt the dignity of human nature, and by his example &s;hew mankind the road to virtue, to happine&s;s and heaven.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, that the <HI>manner</HI> of the Deity's uniting the human nature to his own, in the per&s;on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is far beyond our comprehen&s;ion, at lea&s;t in
<PB N="9" REF="030423_0008_0FE6D092C9A6EE98">this infancy or fir&s;t &s;tage of our exi&s;tence; but &s;o are many of the ways and works of God:&mdash;even the manner of our own &s;pirits being united to gro&s;s mate|rial bodies compo&s;ed of jarring elements, &s;hortly to become a ma&s;s of corruption, and return to their ori|ginal du&s;t. But the name of the incomprehen&s;ible Jehovah is "Wonderful."&mdash;He is wonderful in his eternity; in his infinite, uncreated beauty, perfections, and glory, and in the di&s;play of tho&s;e perfections, in his power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s, made obvious to every intelligent creature in creation and pre&s;ervation; and to the wi&s;e (who are taught of God) in his works of providence and redemption&mdash;Yet creatures of ye&s;|terday, who&s;e rea&s;oning (comparatively &s;peaking) is blindne&s;s and folly, and who&s;e utmo&s;t &s;tretch of con|ception can reach only to the knowledge of "a little part,"&mdash;would fain limit Infinite Wi&s;dom, and call Omnipotence to an account at the bar of infatuated impotence!!! "His ways are not as our ways, nei|ther are his thoughts as our thoughts."</P>
<P>Je&s;us Chri&s;t clearly proved him&s;elf to be the Son of God; not in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as human intelligences are &s;aid to be, but in an extraordinary and &s;uper-eminent degree&mdash;as "Immanuel, God with us." He proved his almighty power by commanding and receiving obe|dience from the united fury of a boi&s;terous wind and &s;ea; by giving &s;ight to tho&s;e born blind, hearing to the deaf, rea&s;on to the deranged in mind, health to the leprous, feet to the lame, &s;trength to the paralytic, and life to the dead.</P>
<P>The dei&s;ts them&s;elves acknowledge that the doc|trines Je&s;us Chri&s;t taught, were an excellent &s;y&s;tem of morals, never exceeded by any; and that the whole of his conduct corre&s;ponded with the purity of his doc|trine: but they &s;eem willing to pa&s;s by his theology&mdash; particularly the plain and clear declarations of the great mercy and love of God to the fallen race (which before that time they could only gue&s;s at, and were in much doubt and uncertainty of) and their &s;alvation
<PB N="10" REF="030423_0009_0FE6D09BD0AB97E8">by his death and re&s;urrection. Whether Mr. Paine, and &s;ome others, think them&s;elves &s;inners or not, a &s;en&s;e of guilt, and the nece&s;&s;ity of an atonement to offended ju&s;tice, &s;eems to have been the <HI>feeling</HI> &s;enti|ment of all nations. Witne&s;s the numerous, co&s;tly &s;acrifices, even of their own children, with a view to expiation. In addition to this, there is an awful hour approaching&mdash;an hone&s;t trying hour&mdash;when the heart will be detected, and the man appear as he really is:&mdash;An infidel candidate for eternity on a death bed is a &s;cene &s;hocking beyond de&s;cription:
<Q><L>"No hope&mdash;no pro&s;pect of a kind reprieve,</L>
<L>"To &s;top his &s;peedy pa&s;&s;age to the tomb:</L>
<L>"But all is melancholy&mdash;all is &s;ad!</L>
<L>"Where then is comfort&mdash;where is con&s;olation to be had?"</L></Q></P>
<P>Let "Fools make a mock at &s;in"&mdash;if they plea&s;e (and they are only fools and madmen who will be guilty of a folly &s;o refined) numerous in&s;tances might be produced wherein a death-bed has effected a &s;ad change of &s;entiment, and made the &s;toute&s;t &s;inner trem|ble. To &s;ay nothing of Spira, Wol&s;ey, Roche&s;ter, Shaft&s;bury, and many others, I could here mention the names of two of my acquaintance who fell victims at the &s;hrine of infidelity. One of them, who was gene|rally thought to be a man of excellent under&s;tanding and fine intellect, who (many years ago) from read|ing the writings of the Dei&s;ts, imbibed their opinions, and publicly profe&s;&s;ed them. He was &s;eized with a lingering di&s;order, which terminated his exi&s;tence: but, &s;everal months before his death, he was in great agony and di&s;tre&s;s of mind, on account of his dei&s;tical principles&mdash;and would hardly, even to the la&s;t, receive any comfort, particularly becau&s;e "<HI>he had denied the Saviour,</HI> the Lord of life and glory."</P>
<P>But I &s;hall never forget the other, more recent, in|&s;tance of the pernicious effects of infidelity. Not many years ago, a gentleman in the &s;tate of Virginia,
<PB N="11" REF="030423_0010_0FE6D09BDC3701D8">with whom I was formerly well acquainted, a man of an affluent fortune, married to an accompli&s;hed lady by whom he had &s;everal fine children, and much re|&s;pected for his urbanity and other good qualities&mdash;took to reading and &s;tudying the writings of dei&s;ts, from which he imbibed their opinions. He committed <HI>&s;uicide.</HI> I have a letter from a friend and corre&s;pon|dent of undoubted veracity, informing me that this ra&s;h act was one of "the fatal effects of infidelity."</P>
<P>Of what u&s;e will the highe&s;t attainments in the knowledge of politics, and the &s;cience of government, be, in the article of death. The&s;e are neverthele&s;s highly nece&s;&s;ary &s;pecies of knowledge; but they cer|tainly ought not to &s;uper&s;ede that which alone maketh wi&s;e to &s;alvation. To prepare for eternity is the grand bu&s;ine&s;s of life; and happy will that man be, who can &s;ay, with triumph, at the la&s;t hour, "O death! where is thy &s;ting? O grave! where is thy victory?</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay nothing about in&s;piration; becau&s;e Mr. Paine him&s;elf admits that the Deity, doubtle&s;s, can communicate from him&s;elf to his creatures, in what manner he plea&s;es; and becau&s;e the &s;ubject has been already treated of, and proved to demon&s;tration, by abler pens.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the divinity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, it was his own repeated declaration, the truth of which he abundantly proved by his almighty and benevolent works; and by the wonders which he wrought in open day, in the pre&s;ence of multitudes, many of whom were his bitter enemies, who&s;e &s;piritual pride, covet|ou&s;ne&s;s, and hypocri&s;y, he expo&s;ed: and the&s;e multi|tudes could not, and did not, deny the facts&mdash;nor that they were &s;upernatural. Indeed, nothing le&s;s than that almighty word, which pronounced, "Let there be light," and light was, could produce &s;uch mighty works. Probably, had they continued to be performed, and performed by men at this day, we might have thought they were only the powers of (what we call) nature, brought to view: but as God
<PB N="12" REF="030423_0011_0FE6D09CEB9DB9C8">did not &s;ee fit to continue tho&s;e miracles longer than he thought they were nece&s;&s;ary to command the atten|tion of mankind to the divinity and me&s;&s;age of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to the &s;ame me&s;&s;age continued by his im|mediate apo&s;tles&mdash;the end being an&s;wered, he with|drew that power: and &s;ince that time, notwith&s;tand|ing great oppo&s;ition, the go&s;pel has been attended with remarkable &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;owing to the excellence and pu|rity of its own nature, and to the powerful effects of it on the heart, when applied thereto by the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>I am &s;urprized at Mr. Paine's ignorance of the hi&s;|tory of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, when he &s;uppo&s;es, that, even after his appearance in his public character, he was "not much known, and lived concealed!"&mdash;Let him, or any other man in his &s;en&s;es, read the hi&s;tory, and they will &s;oon be convinced of the fal&s;ity of this a&s;&s;ertion&mdash;as al&s;o of one, equally wi&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> "That he could not write." He certainly could write with his finger, and why not with a pen? I can find no excu&s;e for &s;uch profound ignorance, unle&s;s it is that which Mr. Paine makes for him&s;elf&mdash;"that he keeps no bible," and con&s;equently that he <HI>reads</HI> no bible. In <HI>this,</HI> at lea&s;t, I give him full credit; becau&s;e the whole of his "Age of Rea&s;on" bears uncontradictory evidence that <HI>here</HI> he &s;poke the truth.</P>
<P>One of Mr. Paine's objections to the &s;acred &s;crip|tures, is, "That Je&s;us Chri&s;t wrote none of his own hi&s;tory him&s;elf."&mdash;But, on &s;erious inve&s;tigation, will it not appear to have been much more wi&s;ely ordered, that an account of his mighty works and doctrine, &s;hould be recorded by others, who were hone&s;t men&mdash;who were eye and ear-witne&s;&s;es to the facts&mdash;and who could have no intere&s;t in deceiving?&mdash;"Let another prai&s;e thee, and not thy own lips," is a le&s;&s;on of mo|de&s;ty and humility which he con&s;tantly taught by his example, and is generally allowed to be a &s;ure &s;ymptom of merit. As man, He never &s;ought his own glory, but the glory of the Father, by who&s;e power he per|formed
<PB N="13" REF="030423_0012_0FE6D09CF90507D8">the many good works, and by who&s;e commi&s;|&s;ion he delivered the heavenly doctrine.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here remark, that, in the few infidels I have had an opportunity of conver&s;ing with, I always found a remarkable ignorance of the &s;criptures&mdash;ex|cept a few pa&s;&s;ages which they thought exceptionable, and which they had occa&s;ionally gleaned from books, or from the conver&s;ation of other people; and that they had taken refuge in infidelity (&s;peaking evil of the things they under&s;tood not) and were oppo&s;ed to the &s;criptures becau&s;e the &s;criptures were oppo&s;ed to their tempers and practices; and the&s;e they were un|willing to rectify or for&s;ake. I perceived, too, that their infidelity lay more in the heart than in the head: and we all know that mankind are more readily di&s;|po&s;ed to believe what they wi&s;h, than what militates again&s;t or condemns their favorite de&s;ires and pur&s;uits, even in ca&s;es where the&s;e are allowed by all other men to be unlawful, and of pernicious con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine, and others of his way of thinking, allow that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was a good man&mdash;a philanthro|pi&s;t&mdash;a teacher of moral virtue&mdash;and a lover of truth; and that he &s;uffered from the very men for who&s;e wel|fare he had lived. Now, if he was all this, what are we to under&s;tand he meant by &s;aying that "He and the Father were one"&mdash;that "He was the true bread from heaven"&mdash;that "He came to give his life a ran|&s;om for many"&mdash;that "He was &s;ent by the Father to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t"&mdash;that "He pro|ceeded from the Father, and was &s;oon to return to Him"&mdash;and when Philip &s;aid, "Lord, &s;hew us the Father and it &s;ufficeth us," he an&s;wered, "Have I been &s;o long time with you, and haft thou not known me, Philip? He that hath &s;een me hath &s;een the Fa|ther" (as far as mortal or material eyes could &s;ee him) "Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or el&s;e believe me for the very work's &s;ake"&mdash;and many pa&s;&s;ages to the &s;ame purpo&s;e? If Je&s;us Chri&s;t

<P>What temptations had the fir&s;t publi&s;hers of the go&s;pel to record fal&s;ehoods, when what they recorded was directly oppo&s;ed to the manners and prevailing vices of Jews and Gentiles&mdash;to their prejudices, pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and e&s;tabli&s;hed religions? If honours, wealth, ea&s;e, and worldly comfort were their object, they pur&s;ued the wrong path: for they experienced no incon&s;iderable portion of contempt and reproach, po|verty and ignominy. Their ma&s;ter had &s;et them an ex|ample, and they cheerfully trod in his &s;teps&mdash;they took up the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame, and endured per&s;ecution even unto death, being &s;upported and comforted by the &s;pirit of God, enjoying a good hope through grace, and drawing all their &s;tores of con&s;o|lation from futurity.</P>
<P>Permit me here to borrow the words of an eminent author on this &s;ubject. "How certain," &s;ays he, "is the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion, and particu|larly of the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, which is a matter of fact on which chri&s;tianity is founded! We have almo&s;t all the concurrent evidences that can be derived from human te&s;timony, joining to confirm this glori|ous truth. The fact is not impo&s;&s;ible; concurrent circum&s;tances ca&s;t a favourable a&s;pect on it; it was foretold by one who wrought miracles, and therefore not unlikely, nor unexpected. The apo&s;tles and fir&s;t di&s;ciples were eye and ear-witne&s;&s;es, for they conver&s;ed with their ri&s;en Lord; they were the mo&s;t plain, ho|ne&s;t men, in them&s;elves; the temptations of worldly intere&s;ts did rather di&s;courage their belief and report of it; they all agree in this matter, though they were men of different characters, <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;hermen,</HI> and <HI>Publicans</HI>&mdash;men of <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Galilee,</HI> and per|haps &s;ome <HI>Heathens</HI> who were early converted. The
<PB N="15" REF="030423_0014_0FE6D0A22D8A3FB8">thing might ea&s;ily been di&s;proved if it were fal&s;e; it hath been conveyed, by con&s;tant tradition and writing, down to our times. Tho&s;e who at fir&s;t doubted, were afterwards convinced by certain proofs; nor have any pretended to give any proof to the contrary&mdash;but merely denied the fact with impudence, in oppo&s;ition to all the&s;e evidences." And let me add, it hath been carried down to our times accompanied with cer|tain rights and ceremonies, received in all ages &s;ince their fir&s;t appointment. And it appears, by what happened not many days after the a&s;cen&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> at the day of Penteco&s;t, that mo&s;t of the three thou&s;and then converted, were the very men who had con&s;ented to, or probably taken a more active part in, his crucifixion and death; which appears evident from their being pricked to the heart when Peter and the re&s;t told them (among other things) that "they had crucified the Lord of Life and Glory;" and they cried out, "Men and brethren, what &s;hall we do?"</P>
<P>Would it not puzzle Mr. Paine to get over the wonderful "gift of tongues," which happened at this fea&s;t? And is it not a&s;toni&s;hing that &s;uch a number of illiterate men &s;hould, all at once, be enabled to &s;peak in twelve or fifteen different languages, with facility, per&s;picuity, and power, &s;o as to a&s;toni&s;h the va&s;t mul|titudes that were then and there collected together? But, perhaps, Mr. Paine may boldly deny the whole hi&s;tory. With equal propriety, and for the very &s;ame rea&s;on, he may object to the whole hi&s;tory of England, or of any other country&mdash;becau&s;e he never &s;aw the acti|ons done which are therein recorded, or the per&s;ons of whom the hi&s;tory may give an account.</P>
<P>Another &s;ubject which falls under the la&s;h of Mr. Paine's ridicule, is that of miracles. By a miracle, I under&s;tand, a di&s;play of power far above human, or any thing known before or &s;ince in nature; and above, or contrary to, its known e&s;tabli&s;hed laws. The na|ture and evidence of miracles have been elucidated by
<PB N="16" REF="030423_0015_0FE6D0A58A80A8E0">much abler pens than mine&mdash;It is unnece&s;&s;ary, there|fore, for me to &s;ay any thing on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As to the hi&s;torical part of the old te&s;tament, Mr. Paine's main cavil and objection will appear to be ra|ther a &s;trong proof of its authenticity. What does all <HI>true</HI> hi&s;tory exhibit, but a picture of the folly, pride, ambition, tyranny, and cruelty of kings, and tho&s;e in power&mdash;the deep-laid &s;chemes and intrigues of courts and courtiers&mdash;private and public ma&s;&s;acres of mankind&mdash;wars, tumults, and a long et cetera of crimes? with, probably, now and then, a tolerably good character, and &s;ome prai&s;e-worthy actions. The &s;tubbornne&s;s of the &s;ix hundred thou&s;and who came out of Egypt is no ways &s;urprizing, when we con&s;i|der that they were newly emancipated from a &s;tate of abject &s;lavery, in which they and their predece&s;&s;ors had been held for above four hundred years. Even the hi&s;tory of Samp&s;on (held in &s;uch &s;overeign contempt by Mr. Paine) is not altogether &s;o unintere&s;ting as he &s;uppo&s;es. It conveys u&s;eful, and I may add nece&s;&s;ary, in&s;truction. It &s;hews, 1&s;t, That great bodily &s;trength without wi&s;dom and the fear of God, in&s;tead of being beneficial, may become very hurtful to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: 2dly, That any connection with a wicked woman is un&s;afe, and (like every other connection which has not virtue for its foundation) &s;eldom or never &s;incere or permanent; con&s;equently that no confidence is to be placed in women of bad character; and 3dly, To have nothing to do with them.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of Jonah certainly contains &s;ome very &s;erious, important, and u&s;eful information, of various kinds, &s;o obvious that I need not wa&s;te my time or tire the reader's patience with producing proofs. I &s;uppo&s;e a laugh, or &s;mile, was all Mr. Paine intended to rai&s;e by his <HI>pretty little conceit</HI> of Jonah &s;wallowing the whale: if &s;o (was not the &s;ubject of too &s;erious a nature to admit of it) it would be almo&s;t a pity to deny his vanity that trifling gratification.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030423_0016_0FE6D0A597BB0ED8">
Mr. Paine puts the Spani&s;h proverbs on a footing equal, if not &s;uperior, to tho&s;e of Solomon. I leave this point to better judges: for my part, I do not he|&s;itate to believe that the Spaniards, as well as the Scots, borrowed their be&s;t proverbs from Solomon, with the alteration only of the idioms and phra&s;eology peculiar to their &s;everal countries. The P&s;alms of David are allowed by Hebrew &s;cholars, and other good judges, to be the &s;ublime and animated a&s;pirations of pious and enlightened minds&mdash;who, as well as Solomon in his dedication of the temple, and all the prophets, in&s;tead of neglecting or de&s;pi&s;ing what is indeed true theology (as far as it goes) every where earne&s;tly re|commended it; as do the whole &s;criptures. To pro|duce only one or two in&s;tances:&mdash;I&s;aiah &s;ays, "Lift up thine eyes now, and behold! Who hath created all the&s;e? Who bringeth them forth by their numbers, and calleth them by their names? I, JEHOVAH, &amp;c." The Deity is often introduced as "the Creator of heaven and earth, the &s;ea, and all that in them is;" and mankind often called upon to con&s;ider Him in this point of view. Mr. Paine &s;eems to have entirely forgot, or never attended to all this. He remembers, indeed, part of what Je&s;us Chri&s;t recommended on this &s;ubject; but forgets that it is plainly and &s;trongly hinted at in the New Te&s;tament by others. As a proof, it will be only nece&s;&s;ary to read, among&s;t ma|ny in&s;tances which might be given, Paul's excellent di&s;cour&s;e to the Athenians.</P>
<P>I think Mr. Paine will not deny that the moral law (the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of which, and of all the pro|phets, is&mdash;"To love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thy&s;elf") is truly rea&s;on|able, even in the very nature and relation of beings, and the eternal fitne&s;s of things. To love the Infinite Source of uncreated beauty, the Author and Foun|tain of happine&s;s and being, upon who&s;e power and goodne&s;s we every moment depend&mdash;to love in our neighbour whatever we ought to love in our&s;elves&mdash;
<PB N="18" REF="030423_0017_0FE6D0B0D56612B8">and what&s;oever we would that men &s;hould do unto us, to do even &s;o unto them&mdash;is certainly ju&s;t and rea&s;on|able; is con&s;i&s;tent with the great purpo&s;e of God in &s;ending his Son into our world to re&s;tore lo&s;t &s;inners to that &s;upreme love to Him&s;elf, and beneficence to our fellow creatures, in which only the primitive recti|tude of our nature con&s;i&s;ted; and obviou&s;ly tends greatly to enhance our happine&s;s.</P>

<P>THIS &s;ubject being already di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by much abler pens (<HI>viz.</HI> Newton and others) I mean only to &s;ugge&s;t a few hints.</P>
<P>Were we better acquainted with the idioms and phra&s;eology of the times in which the prophets lived, their prophecies would not appear &s;o dark to us. Mo&s;t of them &s;eem to have been well under&s;tood by the tyrants and wicked rulers of tho&s;e days&mdash;as ap|pears from the cruel per&s;ecution, even to death, again&s;t the prophets, for telling tho&s;e tyrants painful and di&s;|agreeable truths.</P>
<P>The prophets often &s;pake in hieroglyphics, a mode of writing then much u&s;ed; as if we &s;hould &s;ay, "The lion and unicorn did &s;o and &s;o&mdash;the bald ea|gle will do &s;o and &s;o&mdash;and, where the <HI>in&s;urgents</HI> are, there the eagles will be gathered."</P>
<P>They prophe&s;ied of many events, which they lived to &s;ee accompli&s;hed; &s;ome have been fulfilled &s;ince their deaths; and &s;ome are yet in the womb of time. Cyrus was named, and his remarkable conque&s;ts fore|told, about two hundred years before he was born&mdash;All the prophecies re&s;pecting the Me&s;&s;iah were literally
<PB N="19" REF="030423_0018_0FE6D0B0E1804F28">fulfilled in the per&s;on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The prophecy of Je&s;us (who was the great prophet of his church) re&s;pecting the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, and the con|&s;equent calamities, were fulfilled in a remarkable man|ner: and Eu&s;ebius informs us, that the Chri&s;tians at Jeru&s;alem, relying on that prophecy, and regarding their Lord's advice, left the city, and fled to a place of &s;afety out of its neighbourhood, where they e&s;caped the calamities which ensued.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine has paid our modern poets an extraordi|nary compliment, at the expen&s;e of the ancient pro|phets; and greatly depreciates the character and me|rits of the latter, to appreciate the dignity of the former. I never heard before, that any poets ever pretended to foretell future events, e&s;pecially the fate of nations and kingdoms. The word <HI>prophet,</HI> in &s;cripture language, often &s;ignifies a teacher; and of the&s;e there might be greater and &s;maller, as at this day: but that it oftener &s;ignifies a man in&s;pired by the &s;pirit of the Deity, for the purpo&s;e of foretelling fu|ture great events, appears, on candid examination, to be without any rea&s;onable doubt or controver&s;y; and even &s;ome of the&s;e might have more or le&s;s of that gift, as Infinite Wi&s;dom &s;aw they-were qualified to receive, or able to bear it.</P>
<P>The prophet I&s;aiah, in his 53d chapter, &s;peaking of the Me&s;&s;iah, &s;ays, "He was de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of men: a man of &s;orrows, and acquainted with grief. And we" (the then blind, degraded, and corrupted nation of the Jews, in particular) "hid, as it were our faces from him. He was de&s;pi&s;ed, and we e&s;teem|ed him not." It appears to me, that the dei&s;ts, who deny the divinity of his mi&s;&s;ion, and de&s;pi&s;e or vilify that theology which he came to in&s;truct mankind in, are fulfilling the above prophecy as fa&s;t as they can.</P>
<P>It may not be improper here to take a &s;hort view of the happy tendency and ble&s;&s;ed effects of the truths manife&s;ted in and recommended by the whole of the
<PB N="20" REF="030423_0019_0FE6D0B1EE2118E8">&s;acred &s;criptures, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e by Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>All who know any thing of this revelation <HI>as they ought,</HI> find that it is not only "Glad tidings of great joy," but tends to rai&s;e the &s;oul far above its natural be&s;otted and degraded e&s;tate; &s;upplies endle&s;s exerci&s;e for its noble&s;t powers; &s;trong &s;upport and con&s;olation in the hour of adver&s;ity (and &s;ea&s;ons and circum&s;tances will change in this tran&s;itory &s;cene of our exi&s;tence) and at the hour of death, when even the Balaams (the co|vetous as well as the vainglorious and &s;en&s;ual) of the pre&s;ent day, would wi&s;h to "die the death of the right|eous."</P>
<P>I know this will be called <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> by tho&s;e who are utter &s;trangers to God as their Saviour, and to tho&s;e &s;trong con&s;olations: but every per&s;on knows, or may know, that the &s;oul has its &s;en&s;es and feelings di&s;tinct from, and independent of, tho&s;e of the body. "The heart," &s;ays Solomon, "knows its own bit|terne&s;s&mdash;and a &s;tranger intermeddleth not with its joy."</P>
<Q><L>"What nothing earthly gives, or can de&s;troy,</L>

<L>"Is virtue's prize."</L>
<BIBL>&mdash;<HI>Pope.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>I could name the per&s;on who, after experiencing much of the vici&s;&s;itudes of health and &s;ickne&s;s (among&s;t the re&s;t the yellow fever) when he &s;tood on the bord|ers of eternity, declared, "That he would much &s;ooner forgive the man who made an attempt on his life, than he who would endeavour to deprive him of tho&s;e &s;up|ports and con&s;olations offered in the &s;acred &s;criptures, and obtained by all who &s;incerely a&s;k of God for them." And, &s;urely, he who from vanity, or any other motive, attempts to deprive thou&s;ands, nay, millions (born and to be born) of his fellow-creatures&mdash;free, active, and moral intelligences&mdash;of tho&s;e &s;up|ports and con&s;olations, when they are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="21" REF="030423_0020_0FE6D0B1FABF1000">cannot be a real philanthropi&s;t, or have the &s;hadow of a right to the title; but, on the contrary (what|ever may be his pretentions) is an enemy to mankind.</P>
<P>The Omnipre&s;ent Deity manife&s;ts him&s;elf to every intelligence, ju&s;t as their natures, and moral charac|ters are di&s;po&s;ed, or fitted to receive&mdash;to the froward, he manife&s;ts him&s;elf froward&mdash;to the humble and pe|nitent, he manife&s;ts him&s;elf merciful&mdash;to the obedient and loving, he is loving&mdash;(and his loving kindne&s;s is better than life)&mdash;&s;omething like the image reflected to the per&s;on who looks in a mirror (if I may &s;o expre&s;s it) and not only &s;o, but perhaps, in ten thou&s;and different degrees of beatitude, in proportion to the nature, capa|city, de&s;ire, and aptitude of the intelligent creature; his e&s;&s;ential pre&s;ence is, where his gracious and where his glorious pre&s;ence are not manife&s;ted, felt, or known: and his gracious pre&s;ence (in many and va|rious degrees) where the creature is not prepared to bear the manife&s;tation of his glorious pre&s;ence; and doubtle&s;s, he could make the whole univer&s;e a heaven, if all he intelligences therein were properly qualified to receive &s;uch a glorious manife&s;tation: read what the patriarch Jacob &s;aid after being favoured with that <HI>gracious,</HI> and (in &s;ome degree) <HI>glorious</HI> vi&s;ion in his way to Padan-aram; <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> xxviii. 16 and 17.</P>
<P>But let us go to &s;ome of the more vi&s;ible and hap|py effects of revealed religion; by the in&s;trumentality of which, miracles are &s;till performed.&mdash;Indeed the miracles wrought upon the bodies of men by &s;ome of the prophets, but e&s;pecially by Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, &s;eem to be types of the wonderful changes and cures effected by means of the go&s;pel upon the hearts of tho&s;e who by a living, transforming faith, willingly embrace it, and rejoice to be under the power of its ble&s;&s;ed influence. The minds that are in wor&s;e than Egyptian darkne&s;s, are enlightened; the &s;piritually dead are rai&s;ed; the dumb &s;peak, and &s;ing; the lepers are clean&s;ed; the lame walk, and are &s;trengthened; the mourners are comforted; and to the
<PB N="22" REF="030423_0021_0FE6D0BC4B63DCF0">poor, and tho&s;e who may apprehend them&s;elves the vile&s;t of the vile, the glad tidings of "Peace on earth, and good-will towards men," are proclaimed; and this not to the outward ear only, but to the heart. The effects of this change become vi&s;ible in the life and conver&s;ation. The lover of &s;in becomes a lover of holine&s;s; the cruel and revengeful become meek, placable, forgiving, and benevolent; the liar, a man of &s;trict probity and a lover of truth; the covetous and rapacious, beneficent and heavenly minded; the un|ju&s;t, ju&s;t and faithful; the drunkard, &s;ober and indu&s;|trious, u&s;eful to him&s;elf and a credit to &s;ociety; the proud, humble and affable; and the profligate volup|tuary, who enters the habitation of innocence only to deface the building, and who probably feels a refined gratification in debauching the wife or the daughter of his intimate friend&mdash;becomes, by the operation of re|ligion on his heart, virtuous and cha&s;te&mdash;perhaps the worthy father of a family, whom, both by precept and example, he leads to happine&s;s here, and points the road to an eternity of happine&s;s in the world to come. In &s;hort, every faculty of the &s;oul undergoes an entire revolution.</P>
<P>And is this change effected by any latent power in nature? Is this the work of fallen, depraved, and corrupted man? Then may a bitter fountain i&s;&s;ue out &s;weet waters. No, &s;ays rea&s;on: this work is of God, from whom alone proceedeth every good and perfect gift&mdash;who "giveth liberally, and upbraideth not."</P>
<P>After all the cavils, calumny, and contempt, with which the &s;criptures of revealed religion are treated, I cannot help believing, that
<Q><L>"Were it not for that little book the preacher quotes,</L>
<L>"<HI>We, men of &s;pirit, all,</HI> would cut our throats."</L></Q> This has too frequently been the ca&s;e. The rope&mdash;the reeking blade&mdash;the fatal bullet&mdash;and the deadly cup&mdash;have, in too many in&s;tances, been the dernier
<PB N="23" REF="030423_0022_0FE6D0BC56EB4F40">re&s;ort of men who lived in the world "without God, and without hope." But let me rather veil the awful &s;cene, and dwell with rapture on the bright &s;ide of the picture; where remembrance pre&s;ents to my mind's eye a cloud of witne&s;&s;es, to bear te&s;timony to the &s;up|ports, comforts, and deliverances which they who love and fear God, have, in numberle&s;s in&s;tances, been favoured with; by which they have been enabled to triumph over tribulation, enjoying "a good hope through grace," and having a bright pro&s;pect in eternity.</P>

<HEAD>ON MYSTERY.</HEAD>
<P>BY a my&s;tery, I under&s;tand &s;omething ob&s;cure, unknown, or above the comprehen&s;ion of human under|&s;tanding: and nature abounds with them. What we &s;ee with our eyes, and what the curious enquirer han|dles with his hands, have, in many in&s;tances, no &s;mall degree of my&s;tery in them. Man him&s;elf is a my&s;tery. But, "Who, by &s;earching, can find out God? who can find out the Almighty unto perfection?"</P>
<P>As to the my&s;tery of the incarnation, Mr. Paine him|&s;elf admits that the Deity can make a communication of him&s;elf to whom and in what manner he plea&s;es. A great part of the heathen theology, and even their mythology, was ancient oral tradition, mi&s;erably changed and corrupted. And even this error of theirs might originate from oral tradition of &s;ome prophecy concerning the future appearance of &s;ome me&s;&s;enger, or extraordinary per&s;on, in the character of the Son of God, to deliver them from that darkne&s;s, uncer|tainty, and mental depravity, into which the more in|telligent among them &s;aw and lamented they had fallen. And this &s;eems to be much more probable than that the apo&s;tles and evangeli&s;ts took any hint
<PB N="24" REF="030423_0023_0FE6D0BD65C3BD68">from the heathen mythology; the whole of which they utterly renounce, and &s;everely condemn.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to what Mr. Paine ironically calls the "Chri&s;tian arithmetic;" (where he only expo&s;es his ignorance and mi&s;repre&s;entation) the Chri&s;tians be|lieve and maintain that the DEITY IS ONE. It is true we read of the Father, Son, and Holy Sprit; an idea of him&s;elf which the Deity has revealed, and was doubtle&s;s proper and nece&s;&s;ary to lead guilty fallen man back to him&s;elf, to his favour, moral image, and communion. By the Father, I under&s;tand the <HI>Deity immanent;</HI> by the Son, the <HI>Deity emanent</HI> in the per|&s;on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and by the Holy Spirit, that manife&s;tation and degree of his grace purcha&s;ed by the obedience and merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and be&s;tow|ed on tho&s;e who are willing to receive it. My rea&s;on is generally &s;atisfied with this. The exi&s;tence of an unity in trinity is the declaration of God him&s;elf, who alone knows his own nature and e&s;&s;ence; and when once I am &s;atisfied that the &s;criptures are a true re|cord of the word of God, who cannot lie nor deceive, my rea&s;on tells me I need no other te&s;timony of its truth; becau&s;e <HI>this</HI> is by far the be&s;t and highe&s;t te&s;ti|mony I can have.</P>
<P>At &s;ome happy moments the exerci&s;e of my rea&s;on is perfectly &s;atisfied in contemplating the Unity in Trinity; but I have not words to expre&s;s properly or fully my ideas on the &s;ubject. Were I to u&s;e any term, it would be that of <HI>manife&s;tations</HI>&mdash;three wonderful ma|nife&s;tations of him&s;elf, di&s;tinct, but not &s;eperate. By the&s;e three wonderful manife&s;tations the Deity &s;eems to lead mankind to a much farther knowledge of him|&s;elf; not only of his wonderful mercy and grace to creatures in our guilty condition, but of his holine&s;s, ju&s;tice, and the inflexible regard he has to the honor of his laws and moral government, than they could ever arrive at by what is called natural theology. The glorious Deity is incomprehen&s;ible, and will ever re|main &s;o to every created intelligence. None but the un|created
<PB N="25" REF="030423_0024_0FE6D0BD72CECA48">and infinite Deity can comprehend him&s;elf. He may have, and probably has, many attributes and per|fections not yet manife&s;ted to us either by that part of his creation which we &s;ee and contemplate, or by reve|lation: the idea of which, perhaps, our natures are incapable of bearing; and which, even the highe&s;t angel in heaven cannot yet &s;u&s;tain. Probably the know|ledge of the great I AM will be progre&s;&s;ive to eter|nity. For my part, the more I think of the won|derful manife&s;tations he has already made of him&s;elf to the human race, the more I find I am &s;hort of comprehending; and am lo&s;t in wonder, love, and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured, and I hope with becoming mode&s;ty, to rectify Mr. Paine's ideas of the Trinity. But &s;urely he did not believe what he him&s;elf a&s;&s;erts, when he &s;ays, "The Chri&s;tians have <HI>five</HI> Deities!" among&s;t which are, "The Godde&s;s Nature, and the God Providence." Mr. Paine cannot be in&s;en&s;ible that the chri&s;tians believe nature to be only <HI>the finger of God;</HI> that it is the continuance of that all-creating word which &s;aid, "Let there be light&mdash;and light was;" "Let the earth bring forth," &amp;c. "Increa&s;e and multiply," &amp;c.&mdash;This is nature: the omnipotent power and infinite wi&s;dom of God, manife&s;ted in the creation and continuance of his works. And they believe Providence to be the &s;ame power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s, di&s;played towards nations and individu|als, overruling all de&s;igns, actions, and events (even tho&s;e of free agents) for his glory, and the good of the whole; and e&s;pecially for the benefit of tho&s;e who love him, and fear to offend him; &s;till bringing good out of evil; and manife&s;ting this, &s;ooner or later, in his own good time and way; often in&s;crutable to us, and even oppo&s;ite to our and &s;hort-&s;ighted con|jectures, and by ways and means we &s;hould never have though of. "His way is in the great deep." As he is incomprehen&s;ible in his nature, &s;o is his works. And although this globe is indeed but as a &s;mall &s;peck
<PB N="26" REF="030423_0025_0FE6D0C5A5243978">in the creation; yet to an Infinite Being, who&s;e cen|tre is every where, and circumference no where, there is no great, no &s;mall; and the infant that was born ye&s;terday, is as much the object of his pre&s;ence and attention (according to its nature and capacity) as the highe&s;t archangel in heaven; and this infant, and all mankind, live and breathe in tho&s;e bodies, only &s;o long as his wi&s;dom &s;een fit&mdash;and, when he withdraws his &s;upporting power, they &s;ink into their native ele|ment. Small as this globe we live on, is, the Al|mighty probably intended it (as the &s;criptures encou|rage us to think) to be a theatre on which numbers of intelligences in heaven, or in many other worlds, are looking, and obtaining, in the di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence, a clearer and fuller knowledge of &s;ome of his attributes and perfections, than they could have obtained without this means:&mdash;at lea&s;t, with re&s;pect to our&s;elves it is &s;o.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine has given us a beautiful and entertaining de&s;cription of a&s;tronomy: for which I confe&s;s my&s;elf obliged to him. Here, indeed he appears to be ma&s;|ter of his &s;ubject. I have long been of his opinion with re&s;pect to a plurality of world; and would not he&s;itate to follow him farther even were he to &s;uppo&s;e the number of them almo&s;t endle&s;s. What pity, for the &s;ake of his character as a writer, he was not in one of them when he wrote his "Age of Rea&s;on!" I reverence the &s;cience of a&s;tronomy, and wi&s;h my&s;elf a proficient therein, becau&s;e I think it would tend to kindle my too often cold and languid devotion; and I remember a celebrated author gives it as his opinion, that "An undevout a&s;tronomer is mad!" But hav|ing now a very &s;hort time allotted me to do the work of an eternity in, and that time being very uncertain, I mu&s;t direct my principal attention and &s;tudy to the main bu&s;ine&s;s of life. And if Mr. Paine will de&s;cend a while from the &s;tars, I would point out to him an object near home, and a &s;ubject not altogether un|worthy his contemplations: I mean him&s;elf: in which
<PB N="27" REF="030423_0026_0FE6D0C5B0AFA750">he may find &s;omething de&s;erving his attention, per|haps not entirely unknown to him, but too much ne|glected.</P>
<P>Was I better in&s;tructed in phy&s;ics, it might not be improper nor unentertaining to &s;peak of the very curi|ous workman&s;hip of the body, its various members and powers, all harmonizing, and readily a&s;&s;i&s;ting each other, for the mutual benefit of the whole; and all entirely and readily &s;ubject to the volition of the noble inhabitant. But that is not my intention. Nor is it my intention to attempt a di&s;play of the progre&s;&s;ive powers and faculties of the human &s;oul; what a&s;to|ni&s;hing degrees it has arrived to in the knowledge of nature, of u&s;eful arts, and curious inventions, and in knowledge human and divine in &s;o &s;mall a &s;pace of time; or to what degrees thereof it may arrive, or to what perfection, in the endle&s;s circle of eternity. Here indeed, all power, not only of calculation, but of thought, is lo&s;t! But I intend, in few words, to &s;peak of what I apprehend to be &s;ome of its leading properties, which properties I take to be <HI>intelligence, activity,</HI> and <HI>love.</HI></P>
<P>LOVE is the mi&s;tre&s;s of the &s;oul. The two fir&s;t cater for her: They &s;tore the <HI>memory</HI> for her. The <HI>affections</HI> (her younger &s;i&s;ters) are all linked to her; and where &s;he and they lead, the <HI>will</HI> is &s;ure to follow, a ready volunteer.</P>
<P>Every man fixes his chief love either on the glorious Creator and Benefactor; on him&s;elf; or on &s;ome ob|ject below the Supreme Good. But there is a cer|tain powerful &s;omething in the &s;oul, united to it, and placed in it as a vicegerent or judge, of the nature of which (though I have often felt it approving and com|forting, or di&s;approving or condemning) I mu&s;t own I know le&s;s than of any or of all the re&s;t. I know it is the be&s;t friend or the wor&s;t enemy on earth, fol|lowing us night and day, not only to our mo&s;t retired places, but even to the mo&s;t public places of re&s;ort, and in the mid&s;t of our mo&s;t favourite amu&s;ements.
<PB N="28" REF="030423_0027_0FE6D0C88C2FF308">This power, or principle, we call CONSCIENCE.&mdash;CONSCIENCE is not always &s;o complai&s;ant to LOVE as the re&s;t of the family are. She is very &s;hort-&s;ighted; and &s;ometimes &s;o very fooli&s;h that &s;he will &s;wallow poi&s;on, if it is admini&s;tered in a gilded cup. He is eagle-eyed, looks to con&s;equences, and will remon|&s;trate. She u&s;es all the little arts to coax him; and even calls in the aid of INTELLIGENCE, after having hood-winked him, or interpo&s;ed between him and a very bright &s;un that otherwi&s;e would &s;hine upon him. But, often, all wont do. She then tries opiates&mdash;&s;uch as, a hurry of diver&s;ion and di&s;&s;ipation, or a multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s. Nay, &s;he will &s;ometimes de|grade her&s;elf by &s;wallowing &s;trong drink, and keeping, more or le&s;s, in a &s;tate of intoxication; or by an ar|dent (but often &s;hort-lived) pur&s;uit of &s;en&s;ual plea|&s;ures. If this wont do, &s;he per&s;uades INTELLIGENCE to take a &s;trong do&s;e of infidelity, who then gives in a fal&s;e report; and CONSCIENCE, offended, retires, and &s;huts him&s;elf up in a &s;mall clo&s;et of his own, and falls fa&s;t a&s;leep&mdash;at which all the family (but e&s;pecially LOVE) rejoice greatly. But &s;hould adver&s;ity, &s;ickne&s;s, or the near pro&s;pect of death pre&s;ent it&s;elf, and occa|&s;ion an uncommon &s;tir in the family, CONSCIENCE awakes, &s;tarts up, tells them terrible truths, and pro|phecies much greater di&s;tre&s;s, unle&s;s they &s;peedily con|&s;ent to "turn over a new leaf." Sometimes they will not hearken to him; and, for want of &s;eeking help where they might find it, they fall into de&s;pair, and die.</P>
<P>What &s;eems &s;urprizing, is, that when CONSCIENCE has been long in&s;ulted and defied, and when he has been apparently a&s;leep, he will &s;ometimes &s;tart up &s;ud|denly, even in days of health, ea&s;e, and outward pro&s;perity, and become &s;o very trouble&s;ome, that, ho|ping to get rid of him, LOVE and the re&s;t of the fami|ly (in a frenzy) will pull down the hou&s;e on their own heads; though, I am well per&s;uaded, they &s;oon want
<PB N="29" REF="030423_0028_0FE6D0C899F9F2B8">to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again: but, alas! powerful as they are, they cannot create or reanimate.</P>
<P>Now&mdash;hoping that &s;ome per&s;on of more lei&s;ure, and &s;uperior qualifications, will improve on the hints I have thrown out&mdash;and add to them&mdash;I wi&s;h (per|haps with &s;ome of my readers) to come to a conclu|&s;ion: and in &s;o doing I &s;hall beg leave to u&s;e the words of a worthy friend of mine (gone &s;ome years ago to his reward). After &s;peaking to the unguarded readers of Bolingbroke, Voltaire, D'Argens, Hume, Chubb, D'Alembert, and others, he &s;ays, "If &s;uch readers will deign to turn their attention to a <HI>different cla&s;s of writers;</HI> if they will peru&s;e the writings of a Boyle, a Newton, a Locke, a Grotius, a Clarendon, a We&s;t, a Littleton, a Forbes, and an Addi&s;on, who&s;e <HI>learning, originality of genius, depth of penetration, amiablene&s;s</HI> of <HI>character, profound re&s;earches</HI> into the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e and recondite branches of human and divine knowledge, and <HI>laborious &s;earch</HI> after u&s;eful truth, do ho|nor to human nature, and will render their memory dear to mankind through every period of time&mdash;I &s;ay, if &s;uch per&s;ons will deign to turn their attention to writers of this cla&s;s, their ri&s;ing prejudices in favor of dei&s;m will be quickly annihilated, and they will wonder how any per|&s;on of &s;ound judgment, who had thoroughly &s;tudied the argument, could po&s;&s;ibly fall into the <HI>&s;nare of infidelity.</HI>"</P>
<P>He adds&mdash;"I have de&s;ignedly avoided the mention of <HI>any of the clergy</HI> in the above catalogue of names; becau&s;e they are liable to be &s;u&s;pected as <HI>partial</HI> and <HI>in|tere&s;ted</HI> advocates, in pleading the cau&s;e of chri&s;tianity; though I can really &s;ee no good cau&s;e why the <HI>clergy</HI> &s;hould not be entitled to &s;ome &s;hare of <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI> and <HI>common hone&s;ty</HI> as well as <HI>other</HI> men; and &s;urely if they are not <HI>downright athei&s;ts,</HI> they have as <HI>deep an intere&s;t</HI> in the truths of religion, and as <HI>great rea&s;on</HI> to dread <HI>fal&s;ebood</HI> and <HI>delu&s;ion,</HI> in matters of eternal con|&s;equence, as any of their fellow creatures po&s;&s;ibly can have. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the above mentioned writers (and many other re&s;pectable names might ea&s;ily be added to the

I an&s;wer, true; I am, indeed, a plain man in every re&s;pect, and may &s;ome|times appear a little ru&s;tic, though I was taught to be polite and complai&s;ant on proper occa&s;ions: but the dei&s;ts will not go to church, where they may hear a great deal more of the &s;ame truths, and much better delivered. And though truth is plain and hone&s;t, &s;he is al&s;o meek and loving; and is willing to wait on the&s;e gentlemen at the <HI>pre&s;s,</HI> without a &s;urplice, or any thing that may <HI>frighten young men.</HI></P>
<P>I think I could point out one benefit, at lea&s;t, which even the dei&s;ts might receive by going to church, on Sundays e&s;pecially. Surely a quiet compo&s;ing &s;eat in any place of public wor&s;hip, mu&s;t have a happy ten|dency to refre&s;h their animal &s;pirits, jaded and worn out with the hurry and fatigue of di&s;&s;ipation the pre|ceding day or week; not to mention the plea&s;ures their <HI>philanthropy</HI> might receive on &s;eeing &s;o many of their neighbours and friends &s;eriou&s;ly, but cheerfully, employed in the adoration and wor&s;hip of the "Fir&s;t Great Cau&s;e." They may even venture &s;afely to join in &s;ome parts of the &s;ervice: for the chri&s;tians adore only the "one living and true God," who is <HI>God of nature,</HI> as well as of grace and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>I never heard that a dei&s;t received harm at church: but I under&s;tand many of them have had occa&s;ion to repent their more modi&s;h vi&s;its&mdash;at the card-table, the brothel, and the tavern. I beg leave to add, That they had better not be in too great ha&s;te to turn their backs on their "Father's Hou&s;e;" le&s;t the time come &s;ooner than they expect, when they may want to "fill their belly with <HI>hu&s;ks.</HI>" If any have been led a&s;tray, the &s;ooner the return to the favour of their offended God, the better. If any baptized infidels will &s;pare a little time to read the &s;acred &s;criptures (which they &s;urely never candidly and thoroughly ex|amined)

<P>I de&s;ire, with reverence, to contemplate the Deity in his providence. It appears, that at different ages, and in different manners, he &s;uffers his church to be &s;ifted, or winnowed; &s;ometimes by the &s;word and fire, at other times by the tongue and pen. The pre|&s;ent age may be a winnowing &s;ea&s;on.

He may be &s;orry for others: but let him not indulge a fear that the real church of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t is in danger. If the outward profe&s;&s;ion &s;eems to decline in one place, it will revive with power in another; perhaps in a wilderne&s;s, or with greater &s;ucce&s;s in the very places were at pre&s;ent it &s;eems to decline. The church of Chri&s;t cannot be in danger, &s;o long as the foundations of it are the God who&s;e word &s;hall endure for ever. On the rock, Chri&s;t hath built his church; and the gates of hell &s;hall never pre|vail again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Nor am I fearful of the effects of an infidel publi|cation, &s;hould it accidentally fall into the hands of a well e&s;tabli&s;hed chri&s;tian; for it will probably &s;et him upon enquiring more fully into the evidences of chri&s;|tianity, which will ultimately tend to confirm him in the faith&mdash;I am mo&s;t apprehen&s;ive for youths, who&s;e minds not being fully informed, and who&s;e principles not being fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, the publications alluded to may mi&s;lead the imagination, and open a door to licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s; e&s;pecially as they are generally wrote in a florid &s;tyle, and are calculated to lead the pa&s;&s;ions captive.

<HEAD>SOME THOUGHTS ON IDOLATRY.</HEAD>
<P>THE inattention and vicious propen&s;ities of cor|rupt and degraded mankind begot Idolatry: and, in all ages &s;ince its fir&s;t introduction, idolatry has pre|vented mankind from perceiving the beauty, excel|lence, and beneficial tendency of that true theology which the works of creation and providence, and the gradual revelation added thereto, manife&s;ted from time to time, to call erring mortals to the knowledge of the true God: and, even in countries favoured with all the&s;e manife&s;tations, idolatry &s;till prevents men from acquiring that great and important knowledge, not that gro&s;s &s;pecies of idolatry which requires falling down before images of &s;ilver, gold, wood, and &s;tone, the workman&s;hip of men's hands; but the <HI>idolatry of the heart,</HI> by placing the chief love of the &s;oul upon gold, &s;ilver, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The idol of &s;en&s;ual gratification has many valuable offerings made to it; ambition, many more. But there is a lean, thin idol, compo&s;ed of and frequently blown away by, the breath of the multitude, which &s;ome men wor&s;hip and pray to; yes, <HI>pray to:</HI>&mdash;for if the only true prayer be, the lifting up of the heart, the&s;e idolaters "pray without cea&s;ing."</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="030423_0034_0FE64BE0D34676A8">
In &s;acred &s;cripture, the true God, complaining by the mouth of his prophet, of the gro&s;s idolatry of the Jews as a nation, and alarming them by threatnings to bring them to repentance and reformation, menti|ons &s;ome who had &s;et up their idols in their heart, and &s;ays, "He that &s;etteth up his <HI>idol in his heart,</HI> I will even judge that man by him&s;elf, &s;aith the Lord God." It is this heart-idolatry that chiefly militates again&s;t a pure revelation from an holy and ju&s;t God, and pre|vents thou&s;ands of <HI>profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians</HI> from reaping that &s;aving benefit which the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t offers to all: and if its effects be &s;o dreadful to the&s;e, what mu&s;t they be to tho&s;e who are &s;o far gone in de|pravity as to &s;it in the &s;eat of the &s;corner?</P>
<P>The wor&s;t and mo&s;t dangerous kind of idolatry, is <HI>&s;elf-adoration:</HI> admiring in our&s;elves that rea&s;oning fa|culty, which may be impaired or deranged by a thou|&s;and accidents; a faculty which is often blinded or led a&s;tray by the ruling pa&s;&s;ions; and, though very u&s;eful in matters of a theological, as well as a tem|poral nature, is very impotent in bringing us to the true knowledge of God&mdash;of divine objects&mdash;and of what may properly be called <HI>true religion. This</HI> the Almighty has re&s;erved in his own hands, and be&s;tows it in what manner and to whom he &s;ees fit, in &s;uch way as he does health, &s;trength, wealth, power, tem|perature of climate, &amp;c. and we ought to be truly thankful for every means of acquiring this greate&s;t, be&s;t, and mo&s;t durable of all knowledge, which he favours us with; and not make an idol of our rea&s;on|ing faculty, or think to &s;can or limit the ways of a Being of infinite wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, and power, who cannot err nor do inju&s;tice.</P>

<HEAD>SOME THOUGHTS ON THE DEVIL, AND THE ORIGIN OF MORAL EVIL.</HEAD>
<P>A COMMON error in &s;peaking of the Devil, is in many people's &s;uppo&s;ing that name to &s;ignify only one evil &s;pirit: whereas it properly means <HI>a legion,</HI> or the whole ho&s;t of apo&s;tate &s;pirits (probably con&s;i&s;t|ing of innumerable millions) who are &s;aid to be "the third part of heaven," with Satan, the adver|&s;ary or accu&s;er, at their head. When a number of men, a few years ago, led on by one SHAYS, rai&s;ed an in&s;urrection again&s;t the government, it was a com|mon &s;aying, that "SHAYS" did &s;o and &s;o. So, like|wi&s;e, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, or the duke of York are &s;aid to do &s;o, or &s;o;&mdash;though the very actions alluded to are performed by the men under their command. Ju&s;t &s;o we &s;peak of the devil. It has become the phra&s;eology of cu&s;tom, for time immemorial has given &s;anction to it.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;pirits being created pure intelligences, high|ly favoured and happy, delighting in the knowledge and &s;uperior love of the eternal and infinitely glorious Creator.&mdash;They were created free agents, and might of cour&s;e fall into error. Overpowered with the ra|diance of the glory of Jehovah, they might make ex|cur&s;ions among&s;t the immen&s;ity of his works, as a kind of relief; and, turning their attention upon them&s;elves, and con&s;idering the va&s;tly &s;uperior powers and facul|ties they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed above the other objects of creation, they might transfer gradually that &s;upreme love which was due only to the Mo&s;t High, unto them&s;elves: &s;o that, forgetting their dependence, they fell from the purity in which they were created, by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the divine law, and acting contrary to the light at fir&s;t
<PB N="37" REF="030423_0036_0FE6D0DCD57EF1E8">imparted to them. Being thus di&s;qualified for the hea|venly abodes, they were driven from thence to the place prepared for them, for which they had previou&s;|ly prepared them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I offer the&s;e thoughts as rational conjecture only, from the few hints given us in the &s;criptures: for of the hi&s;tory of the&s;e apo&s;tate &s;pirits we have only a few hints given us&mdash;probably le&s;t it &s;hould call our atten|tion from a mournful tragedy of a nature &s;omewhat &s;imilar, in which we are all deeply concerned.</P>
<P>It was not merely the eating of an apple, but the lo&s;s of the divine image by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, which con|&s;tituted the crime of our fir&s;t parents. But as they were not &s;elf-tempted, like the fallen angels, the De|ity &s;hewed mercy towards them, and gave them the hope of a rein&s;tatement in his favour, by a way pointed out by him&s;elf, whereby the communication was again opened between God and man, and man made capable of a much greater degree of glory and happine&s;s than that from which he had fallen. But from the fall of Adam from a &s;tate of innocency, but more e&s;pecially from that of the apo&s;tate &s;pirits, we may plainly &s;ee, that <HI>any</HI> gift, however eminent, or u&s;eful in other re&s;pects, may become wor&s;e than nothing, when &s;eparated from the love of God, the e|ternal and infinite fountain of light, life, and happi|ne&s;s, by a perver&s;ion of the rea&s;oning intellect.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tate &s;pirits fell into darkne&s;s, and are "held in chains of darkne&s;s." They are &s;o corrupted that they neither <HI>love,</HI> nor de&s;ire to <HI>know</HI> real good: but love and know evil only. And in&s;tances have not been wanting among mankind, of &s;ome who by perverting their rea&s;on, have lo&s;t <HI>the true light,</HI> and "the light in them became darkne&s;s:" and when this is the ca&s;e, "How great is that darkne&s;s!"</P>
<P>To conclude.&mdash;If this account of the origin of mo|ral evil be rational, it will appear, that as God is the fir&s;t cau&s;e of all good, the abu&s;e of moral liberty was
<PB N="38" REF="030423_0037_0FE6D0E6578AEAA0">the cau&s;e of all moral evil; and that natural, or phy|&s;ical evil, was &s;ent as a means to cure or re&s;train it.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine &s;ays, that the &s;criptures repre&s;ent the Devil as triumphing over Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Quite the re|ver&s;e is the truth: for though he is repre&s;ented as prompting wicked men to put Je&s;us to death, yet the re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion are a full refutation of this mi&s;take of Mr. Paine's.</P>
<P>Permit me here to ob&s;erve, that I cannot help think|ing the &s;piritual world is nearer to the material than is generally imagined, and is in &s;ome mea&s;ure hid in it, and in all men united to it. Probably every man is attended by a good and a bad angel. The bad angel comes with a cup of poi&s;on covered with honey: the good angel comes with a healing and comforting draught; but &s;ometimes with a rod al&s;o in his hand with which he cha&s;ti&s;es bad boys and girls ("children of a larger growth") for breaking over the <HI>hedge</HI> plant|ed for their good. He was a wi&s;e man, who informs us, "He that breaketh over a hedge, a &s;erpent &s;hall bite him."</P>
<P>That our bodies are recipients, we all know; that our &s;ouls are recipients al&s;o (with a freedom of choice) we may know; upon this principle all education is built; whatever object our love, or chief de&s;ire, goes out after, our &s;pirits may be &s;aid to feed upon, to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure filled with, and to this object they will acquire a &s;imilarity; when the heart is brooding, or feeding on moral evil, is it not rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that, as birds who feed on carrion, by &s;ome in&s;tinct in their nature, &s;mell it at a great di&s;tance, and move towards it; &s;o evil &s;pirits, by &s;ome &s;piritual in&s;tinct, find out and draw near to the &s;oul that is feeding on evil or mi&s;chief; feed with it, and prompt it to the commi&s;&s;ion, or perpetration of evil actions? and he that &s;eedeth on moral evil, &s;hall afterwards, have his mouth filled with gravel, and his heart with gall and wormwood.</P>
<P>"Doth he not &s;peak in parable?"</P>

<HEAD>SOME THOUGHTS ON EDUCATING YOUNG MEN FOR THE GOSPEL MINISTRY.</HEAD>
<P>HAD I twenty &s;ons I would not educate any of them purpo&s;ely for the mini&s;try, as a profe&s;&s;ion or of|fice whereby he was to get his bread. But if I per|ceived any one of them of a more &s;erious, attentive turn of mind than ordinary,&mdash;who &s;eemed to delight in contemplating the GREAT FIRST CAUSE, in his glorious and &s;tupendous works of creation, providence and redemption&mdash;who delighted in reading in, and me|ditating on, the &s;acred records, who was free from an attachment to vice, and wi&s;hed to be in&s;trumental in promoting the glory of God&mdash;I would give him the edu|cation nece&s;&s;ary for a public &s;peaker, that if he cho&s;e the office of a mini&s;ter, he might be able to give a di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;acred &s;criptures becoming their dignity, and be an ornament to his profe&s;&s;ion. I have &s;een &s;ome, yea, many &s;uch men in the mini&s;try; and I &s;incerely wi&s;h an abundant increa&s;e to their number.</P>

<HEAD>ON "WHAT IS THE WORD OF GOD?"</HEAD>
<P>THE word of God was from eternity. It was a creating, and &s;till is a &s;aving word&mdash;a word of life and power in the hearts of all who obey it. It har|monizes with the written word, and works generally by means of it. Yet God, as a Saviour, has other means whereby he calls &s;inners to repentance&mdash; &s;uch as &s;ickne&s;s,
<PB N="40" REF="030423_0039_0FE6D0E89E021D18">lo&s;&s;es, di&s;appointments, remarkable deliverances, &amp;c. The word was <HI>immanent,</HI> with God, and is God: and became <HI>emanent,</HI> partly by his works and perfectly in and by the per&s;on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and is &s;ealed in the heart by his Almighty &s;pirit.</P>
<P>P. S. Some youth of &s;uperficial ob&s;ervation, bia&s;&s;ed by their propen&s;ities, and plea&s;ed with the florid &s;tyle and licentious tendency of a great part of "The Age of Rea&s;on," thought it unan&s;werable;&mdash;but upon a clo&s;er inve&s;tigation, they will find that the greate&s;t part is made up of bold a&s;&s;ertion without proof&mdash;buf|foonery and palpable mi&s;repre&s;entation.&mdash;In this re|ply there is no fault found with his &s;entiments on the education of youth in general, and he is rather compli|mented for his a&s;tronomy&mdash;but a reply to his fal&s;e rea|&s;oning on matters of much higher and more permanent concern, was all that was intended.</P>
