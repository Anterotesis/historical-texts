<P>CANAAN is &s;ituated in A&s;ia Major, or the greater A&s;ia, one of the mo&s;t famous provinces of Syria; called by &s;everal names; as 1. The land of Canaan, from Canaan the &s;on of Ham, the &s;on of Noah, who by his often cha&s;ings, was driven to po&s;&s;e&s;s and inherit the &s;ame. 2. The land of Promi&s;e, becau&s;e God had promi&s;ed it to the patriarchs, Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, and their po&s;terity. 3. I&s;rael, of the I&s;raelites, from Jacob, who was &s;urnamed I&s;rael. 4. Judea, from the Jews, or people of the tribe of Judah. 5. Pale&s;tin, by Ptolemy and others, or the land of the Phili&s;tines, a potent nation that peopled part of it. 6. The Holy Land, as the country in which the holy people dwelt, who had the law, the promi&s;es and the prie&s;thood, and &s;o denominated by the Chri&s;tians, becau&s;e herein was wrought the work of our &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chir&s;t, our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="030301_0003_0FE5AB88B53EFB40">This country is &s;eated in the middle of the world, between the third and fourth climates, about 52 degrees north to the Equin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctial Line, the longe&s;t day being fourteen hours and a quar|ter; &s;ituated between the Mediterranean Sea and Arabia, from which it is bulwarked beyond Jor|dan with a continual ridge of mountains, which &s;ecures it from the burning air of the de&s;erts of Arabia Petrea, and Celo-Syria, that lie on the Ea&s;t thereof; as Idumea, the wilderne&s;s of Paran, and Egypt on the &s;outh; part of Phenicia and Mediterranean Sea on the we&s;t, the mountains of Libanus, or Lebanon, and the other part of Phenicia on the north. It extends from 31 to 33 degrees; &s;o that in length from Dan to Beer|&s;heba it is not full two hundred miles long, nor doth the breadth exceed fifty (reckoning a thou|&s;and paces to a mile) and the whole circumference does not exceed four hundred miles. A coun|try &s;o fruitful, that the &s;cripture tells us, it was a land that flowed with milk and honey, and the glory of all lands. The &s;alubrity of the air is excellent, the northern mountains keeping the colder bla&s;ts at their due di&s;tance, and the mid|land &s;ea &s;ending thither its refre&s;hing breezes. This being that which the &s;cripture u&s;ually calls the great &s;ea, for the Hebrews were little ac|quainted with the ocean, and &s;o they gave the name of &s;ea to lakes, or any large conflux of waters. The winter is neither too cold, nor the &s;ummer too hot. The inner part of the coun|try is diver&s;ified with beautiful mountains and Hills, advantageous for vines, fruit-trees, and
<PB N="5" REF="030301_0003_0FE5AB88B53EFB40">
&s;mall cattle, and the delightful vallies are water|ed with a great number of torrents, be&s;ide the ri|ver Jordan. The rains fall very &s;eldom, and are very regular, coming in the &s;pring and autumn, which the &s;cripture calls the rains of the morning and evening, con&s;idering the year as a day. In &s;ummer the abundant dews &s;upply the rarity of the &s;howers. The very rocks produce abundance of fruits and &s;weet &s;prings. The plea&s;ant pa&s;|tures feed great numbers of all &s;orts of cattle, and the cows give the be&s;t milk in the world. And all kinds of bea&s;ts and fowl are to be found in abundance.</P>
<P>And though &s;ome authors write, that we mu&s;t not judge of the Holy Land by what is &s;een at this day, being now fallen under the do|minion of the Turks and Arabians, who by their continual wars and ravages, have made it almo&s;t de&s;olate and a de&s;ert, and like a place for&s;aken of God. Yet the late travellers a&s;&s;ert, that we ought not to believe the reports of tho&s;e pilgrims, who arriving at Joppa, from thence up the hills to Jeru&s;alem, and then back again to the &s;ea for fear of the Arabs; whereas others who have been more adventurous, and have had the cou|rage to trace through the body of the country, have given far more advantageous accounts of it, than the other who have only footed it over the mountaneous tract of Judea, which was ne|ver reputed famous for beauty or fruitfulne&s;s. The&s;e travellers tell us, that though the face of the land be &s;omewhat deformed for want of cul|tivation, by the barbarous infidels, and may po&s;|&s;ibly

in part groan under the heavy cur&s;e of God for the &s;ins of its former inhabitants, yet &s;ome of the verdure and features of its ancient excel|lencies are &s;till &s;cattered here and there, as te&s;ti|monies of its former glory; as particularly in the region of Galilee, in the northern parts whereof &s;tands a plea&s;ant range of mountains by the name of Lebanon, containing a valley of fifty miles in length, and twenty-five in breadth, in the mid&s;t whereof is the fair city of Dama&s;cus, about &s;ix miles in compa&s;s, fortified with a wall and double ditches. The country adjacent is &s;o exceeding fruitful, that for the deliciou&s;ne&s;s thereof it is called the Garden of Eden to this day, and the plains thereof are the mo&s;t admira|ble pro&s;pects that any eye can behold upon earth. And Mr. Biddulph, an Engli&s;h divine, travel|ling over a mountain near the &s;ea of Galilee, found it extreme plea&s;ant, and &s;o be&s;pangled with a variety of flowers among the green gra&s;s, that they &s;eemed as it were to laugh and &s;ing, as the p&s;almi&s;t expre&s;&s;es it. All the way they tra|velled that day, the hills and vallies were extra|ordinary fertile, according to the de&s;cription of Mo&s;es, Deut. viii. A land of brooks of water, of fountains, and depths that &s;pring out of vallies and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig-trees, &amp;c. The fields of Ba&s;han, or Beth&s;han, in Samaria, were the like&punc; and coming to a place called Jenine, or Engannim in &s;cripture, they &s;aw very fine gardens, orchards, and &s;prings of water. And north, of Lidda, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r the ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le of Angia, in his province, they entered a good|ly

fore&s;t full of tall and delightful trees, inter|mixed with fruitful and flowery vales, &s;o that nothing could be more entertaining, and per|haps the whole earth cannot produce a more plea&s;ant pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>In Judea, between Rama and Jeru&s;alem, are exceeding &s;at pa&s;tures, about &s;ix miles in length, and the ri&s;ing hills are mixed with fertile vallies. The vallies of Rephaim, E&s;hcol, and Jericho, are very plea&s;ant, except tho&s;e adjoining to the &s;ea of Sodom, and the country in general is highly prai&s;ed by tho&s;e who have travelled mo&s;t exten|&s;ively in it, and many places de&s;cribed as ex|ceedingly delightful. And though this ble&s;&s;ed land lies in a hot climate, equal to &s;ome parts of burning Barbary, yet by rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n of the moun|tains, vallies, &s;prings, and rivers, and a we&s;tern &s;ea, it is a moderate country compared to tho&s;e in the &s;ame latitude.</P>
<P>The fruits of the lands are principally the&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alm, honey, &s;pices, mirrh, nuts and almonds; nor is their wheat, nor oyl, to be forgotten, with which they trade in the market of Tyrus; nor their barley, rice, pul&s;e, melons, cucumbers, figs, manna, frankincen&s;e, citrons, fennel, &s;age wild in the fields, and onions thrice as big as any of ours, very plea&s;ant and of no offen&s;ive &s;mell, but comfortable to the &s;tomach, and therefore may give us a hint why the I&s;raelites &s;o much de&s;ired them. Al&s;o mu&s;tard, which is the lea&s;t of &s;eeds among garden plants, and yet bring|eth forth the large&s;t body, e&s;pecially in the ea&s;t|ern parts, of which the Jewi&s;h Talmud relates
<PB N="8" REF="030301_0005_0FE5ABC7415A1990">
one or two &s;tories: As that there was in Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem a &s;talk or trunk of a mu&s;tard tree which had three branches, and one branch was broken off to cover a potter's &s;hed, under which he formed his earthen ware in &s;ummer time, and that from this branch was taken the quantity of twenty-four figs of mu&s;tard &s;eed. Again Rabbi Simeon a&s;&s;erts in the Talmud, that he had in his garden a mu&s;tard &s;talk &s;o big, that he u&s;ed to climb up as into a fig-tree. Buckorf relating the&s;e pa&s;&s;a|ges, avouches not for the full credit of them, but only &s;hews that this plant was of a large growth in the&s;e parts, and may confirm the letter of our Saviour's parable concerning it. The mountains of Judah and Ephraim were places of great vine|yards, and the relation of the &s;pies which Mo&s;es &s;ent, who brought that prodigious clu&s;ter of grapes from E&s;hcol, is a &s;ufficient evidence of their largene&s;s, if compared with tho&s;e of Spain, France, or Italy. Around Jericho there were palm trees of va&s;t revenue, through their &s;udden &s;pringing up after they wore lopped, and it was the only part of the world where true balm was to be found. The mountains likewi&s;e produce gold, &s;ilver iron and copper mines. And there &s;eemed to be nothing wanting in this Garden of God that was nece&s;&s;ary either for the u&s;e or de|light of mankind.</P>
<P>The fruitfulne&s;s of the country, and the care they took to cultivate it, may make us conceive how that being &s;o little, it could nouri&s;h &s;o great a number of men; be&s;ides, the I&s;raelites were but little employed in maritime affairs, to fur|ni&s;h
<PB N="9" REF="030301_0005_0FE5ABC7415A1990">
them&s;elves with foreign wares, which very much confirms the wonderful plenty of this land, and it is a country full of hills, which renders it much larger than a level champain country.</P>
<P>By the degrees of lattitude, St. Jerom reck|ons that from Dan to Beer&s;heba it is not two hundred miles, and that the ordinary breadth of the land is about &s;ixty miles; but to them that travel up and down its hills and dales it will ex|tend much farther. The&s;e ob&s;ervations may &s;trengthen our faith to believe all that the &s;crip|ture &s;ays of this holy land, and its numerous in|habitants, notwith&s;tanding it is confined within &s;uch &s;mall limits as we have mentioned. When the people fir&s;t entered that country under Jo|&s;hua, there were above &s;ix hundred thou&s;and men bearing arms, from twenty years old to &s;ixty, and we read in Judges, that in the war of Gibeah the only tribe of Benjamin, the lea&s;t of all had an army of twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and men, and that the re&s;t of the people amounted to four hundred thou&s;and: King Saul marched with two hundred and ten thou&s;and again&s;t the Amale|kit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, when he extirpated them. King David kept continually on foot twelve bodies of twenty-four thou&s;and a piece, who &s;erved by months, which was in all two hundred and four &s;core thau&s;and men, and in the numbering of the people which brought the anger of God upon him, there were found in this &s;mall compa&s;s of earth, fifteen hundred three &s;core and ten thou|&s;and men in I&s;rael and Judah which drew &s;word, and were fit for war, be&s;ides the men of Levi
<PB N="10" REF="030301_0006_0FE5AB79A6C3DFB8">
and Benjamin, and be&s;ides the women, children and aged per&s;ons, and be&s;ides the &s;trangers and heathens, and the remainder of the Phili&s;tines which were not fully rooted out at David's time, none of which were in&s;erted in Joab's li&s;t, 1 Chron. 21.5. Neither was the mu&s;ter of Jeho|&s;haphat much di&s;proportionate, for although he had not much above a third part of David's kingdom, yet he maintained &s;everal bodies of very good troops, which altogether made up eleven hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and men effective|ly, without reckoning the garri&s;ons that were in his &s;trong holds, 2 Chron&punc; xvii.</P>
<P>However in all this there is nothing incredi|ble; for be&s;ide the indubitable authority and veracity of &s;acred writ, which ought to be un|que&s;tionably believed and attended to, we find the like examples in common hi&s;tory: The great Thebes of Egypt rai&s;ed &s;even hundred thou&s;and brave &s;oldiers of its own inhabitants alone. At Rome, in the fir&s;t year of Severus Tullius, be|ing the hundred and eighty-eighth year from its foundation, there were counted four &s;core thou|&s;and citizens able to bear arms, and yet all the&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the lands adjacent to Rome, and whereof the mo&s;t part is barren and uninhabited; for their dominions extend no further than eight or ten leagues: But herein con&s;i&s;ted the policy of the ancients, that in&s;tead of invading and di&s;|turbing their neighbors, they endeavored to people and manure their country, whether little or much. They &s;tudied to render marriages happy, and life ea&s;y, to procure health and abun|dance,
<PB N="11" REF="030301_0006_0FE5AB79A6C3DFB8">
and to rai&s;e from their land all that it could produce: They exerci&s;ed their citizens by labor, in&s;pired them with the love of their coun|try, of union between them&s;elves, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the laws: This is what they called policy.</P>
<P>The&s;e maxims perhaps &s;ome will &s;ay are very pretty, but let us come to particulars, and &s;hew how it was po&s;&s;ible &s;o &s;mall a country as Pale&s;tine &s;hould nouri&s;h &s;o great a number of men. An acre of good land bringing forth five quarters, a comb, and a bu&s;hel of wheat, will feed four men for a year, allowing each two pounds and &s;ix ounces of bread every day, which is about three bu&s;hels a month, and thirty-&s;ix bu&s;hels a year to each man; but &s;ince our I&s;raelites were great eaters, let us allow them double the nou|ri&s;hment; that is to &s;ay, four pounds twelve ounces of bread a day: Thus an acre will be &s;ufficient to feed two men; and by this account we &s;hall have land &s;till remaining: For a league &s;quare makes five thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and twenty-five acres, by reckoning three thou&s;and geometrical paces in a league, five feet in a pace, twenty feet in a rod, and an hundred rods in an acre. The kingdom of Judea was at lea&s;t &s;ixty leagues in length, and about twenty in breadth, counting the length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and might &s;upport twenty millions of people: So it was ea&s;y to levy twelve hundred thou&s;and &s;word men in a country, where all people bore arms, and &s;till to have corn to &s;ell to &s;trangers towards the purcha&s;e of cattle; for if the flocks that country
<PB N="12" REF="030301_0007_0FE5ABAE26993DA8">
produced did not &s;ufficiently furni&s;h them with wool and fle&s;h, we need not doubt but that tri|butary &s;trangers brought them many cattle. Je|ho&s;haphat, be&s;ides the tribute of money which he exacted from the Phili&s;tines, received from the Arabians &s;even thou&s;and five hundred rams, and as many goats, and there are other examples of the like tributes: Add to this, that the I&s;raelites lived frugally, and that all the good land they had was carefully manured; &s;ince there were few woods, they had neither parks for hunting, nor avenues, nor bowling greens, nor gra&s;s plats. We &s;ee by the canticles of Solomon, their gardens were full of fruit trees, and aromatic plants: and the mildne&s;s of their climate requi|red but little trouble to furni&s;h lodging and rai|ment, according to their &s;imple cu&s;tom. To this we may add, that the Jews in their greate&s;t glory, under David and Solomon, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed countries far more exten&s;ive than Canaan; their dominions extended from the Mediterranean Sea to the river Euphrates, and from the Red Sea, near to the Black Sea; which was the accom|pli&s;hment of the promi&s;e made to the Patriarchs, of giving their feed dominion from &s;ea to &s;ea, and from the river to the end of the earth.</P>

<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> The &s;everal captivities of the Jewi&s;h Nation, after they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the land of Canaan.</HEAD>
<P>THIS happy country was divided into thirty kingdoms, or principalities, when the I&s;ra|elites, under the conduct of their captain general, Jo&s;hua, by the command of God, made a con|que&s;t thereof, mo&s;t of the ancient inhabitants be|ing for their abominations excluded out of the land or de&s;troyed by the &s;word of the I&s;raelites, who afterwards governed the country by rulers and judges, till the time of Samuel, being about four hundred years. The&s;e rulers, or judges, were not all of one tribe, but the mo&s;t ancient, grave, and prudent men were cho&s;en out for this government under which the Almighty had pla|ced them. At their earne&s;t reque&s;t, that they might be like other nations, the Lord appointed the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a king, and &s;o their government was changed from a theocracy, or government appointed by God, &s;o that of a monarchy, under which they continued from the year of the world 2909, to the year 3416, during which &s;pace of time, by their repeated idolatries, oppre&s;&s;ions and other great crimes, they provoked the Almighty to bring them into bondage under &s;everal foreign princes, who were ambitious to incorporate that happy land with their own; and at length by per&s;ecuting and putting to death the &s;aints and prophets &s;ent them from God, and crucifying the &s;on of God, the Lord of Glory, and the Sa|viour of mankind, with their murderous hands&punc;
<PB N="14" REF="030301_0008_0FE5ABEE19637B30">
and finally wi&s;hing that the guilt of his innocent blood might fall on them and their children, they brought their government and country to utter ruin and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The I&s;raelites were ten times led into captivi|ty, four times by the hands of Sanherib, or Sennacherib, four times by Nebuchadnezzer, once by Titus Ve&s;pa&s;ian, and once by Adrian, Emperor of Rome, as it is recorded in &s;cripture, and according to the account of Jo&s;ephus, with other hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t captivity was by Sanherib, who in|vaded the land, and tran&s;planted the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Mana&s;&s;eh, he took away al&s;o the golden calf which Jeroboam, the &s;on of Nebat had made; he carried the I&s;|raelites into Helan, Habor, to the river Gozan, and to the cities of the Medes. This captivity was in the time of Pelah, the &s;on of Remaliah, in the year from the creation of the world 3263.</P>
<P>The &s;econd captivity happened &s;oon after, for Ho&s;hea the &s;on of Ela who remained, &s;lew Pekah, the &s;on of Remaliah, king of I&s;rael, and then be|came the &s;ervant and &s;ubject of Sanherib &s;even Years; then came Sanherib the &s;econd time, and carried away the tribes of A&s;her, I&s;&s;achar, Zebulon and Nepthali, of whom he &s;et free one out of every eight, he al&s;o took away another calf that was in Bethel.</P>
<P>The third captivity was in the reign of Zedeki|ah the &s;on of Ahaz, in the forth year of who&s;e reign Sanherib came and intrenched about Sama|ria, be&s;ieging it three years, and at length took
<PB N="15" REF="030301_0008_0FE5ABEE19637B30">
it, in the &s;ixth year of the reign of Hezekiah; &s;o he led away the I&s;raelites that were in Sama|ria, and the tribe of Ephraim, and the re&s;t of Mana&s;&s;eh.</P>
<P>The fourth captivity was by Nebuchadnezzer, who having reigned eight years, made war a|gain&s;t Jeru&s;alem, bringing with him the Clinte|on Hereticks out of Babylon, Ethiopia, Areim, and Sephirvaim. And in Judea he took an hun|dred and fifty cities in which ware the two tribes of Judah and Simeon, which he carried with him, and cau&s;ed them forthwith to be &s;ent into Halan and Habor, until the king of Ethiopia re|belled again&s;t him who&s;e kingdom was on the Southern part of Egypt. Then taking Simeon and Judah with him, he made war with the E|thiopian king. So the holy and ble&s;&s;ed God pla|ced them in the dark Mountains. Thus in the&s;e four captivities the ten tribes were carried into bani&s;hment by Sanherib and Salmana&s;&s;er. There remained yet of Judah an hundred and ten thou|&s;and, and Benjamin an hundred and thirty thou|&s;and in the city of Jeru&s;alem, over whom reign|ed Hezekiah. Moreover Sanherib, or Senna|cherib king of A&s;&s;yria came out of Ethiopia a|gain&s;t Jeru&s;alem again with an army of one hun|dred and ten thou&s;and men, but the holy God overthrew them, for the angel of the Lord &s;mote an hundred eighty and five thou&s;and in one night. This &s;laughter was in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah, in the year of the world 3294. From which overthrow till the time that Nebu|chadnezzer invaded the Jews, to the reign of Jehoiakim were an hundred and &s;even years.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="030301_0009_0FE5ABD636C8BC08">The fifth captivity was in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, when Nebuchadnezzer, came the fir&s;t time and carried away 3023 of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and &s;even thou&s;and of their mo&s;t valient men of the tribes, whom they bound in chains.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth captivity was about &s;even years af|ter, when Nebuchadnezzer came unto Daphne, a city of Antioch, from whence he carried into bondage four thou&s;and &s;ix hundred of the tribe of Judah, of Benjamin fifty thou&s;and, and of the other tribes &s;even thou&s;and, and tra&s;migrated them into Babylon.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh captivity happened about nine years after this; for in the 9th year of the reign of Zedekiah, Nebuchadnezzer in the 10th year of his reign came the third time to Jeru&s;alem, and overcame Zedekiah, he burnt the temple, took away the pillars, the brazen &s;ea, and the furniture that Solomon had made, and all the ve&s;|&s;els of the hou&s;e of the Lord, and the trea&s;ures of the hou&s;e of the king which was in Jeru&s;alem, and &s;ent them all to Babylon. He likewi&s;e &s;lew of the I&s;raelites nine hundred and one thou&s;and, be&s;ides them that were &s;lain to revenge the blood of Zacharias. The Levites &s;tood &s;inging a &s;ong whil&s;t &s;laughter was made of them, but they were not able to fini&s;h it before the enemy en|tered the temple, and found them &s;tanding in their places with harps in their hands; therefore he carried away in this captivity 600 of the Le|vites, who were of the &s;eed of Aron, whom when the Gentiles had brought to the rivers of
<PB N="17" REF="030301_0009_0FE5ABD636C8BC08">
Babylon, they demanded of the Jews, Sing a &s;ong of Sion.

<P>The ninth captivity of the Jews was under the conduct of the Romans. When the Jews having made the full mea&s;ure of their guilt run over, by putting to death the Lord of life, God's judgments, according to their de&s;erts, and our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's prophecy, quickly overtook them.

And this divi&s;ion of tribes without commixion, which was ob&s;erv|ed by no other nation but the Jews, is &s;till mo&s;t religiou&s;ly continued among the Tartars.</P>
<P N="4">4. The number of their tribes is the &s;ame, which are ten in all, no more nor le&s;s than the I&s;raelites, from one of which it is &s;uppo&s;ed, the Turks have their origin.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Tartars have a tradition from their ance&s;tors that they had their pedigree from the I&s;raelites, who were tran&s;planted near the Ca&s;|pian, or Hircanian &s;ea, from which tradition it is reported that Tamerlane the great would boa&s;t him&s;elf, that he was de&s;cended from the tribe of Dan.</P>

<P N="6">6. Though the Tartar language be yet un|known, becau&s;e they live as &s;avage people, without &s;ociety or commerce with other nations, &s;uffering none to come within them; yet the Ru&s;&s;ians affirm, that their language hath many Arabic words, and is not much different from the Turki&s;h tongue, which many travellers ob|&s;erve has much affinity with the Hebrew.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, The Tartars are circumci&s;ed, as were the I&s;raelites and Jewi&s;h people. As for the o|ther two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which for their notable infidelity, and contempt of the Son of God, were ma&s;&s;acred, di&s;per&s;ed, and captivated by the Romans, it is as well known both where they are, and how they live, not di&s;|tingui&s;hed by their tribes, not yet united into one policy or community, but diffu&s;ed in &s;mall numbers, and deprived of all, &s;ave their name, which they retain rather for a reproach than an honor, being thereby noted by other nations to be that people whom God has rejected for their infidelity.</P>
<P>If it be objected, that it is a thing unworthy, and unbe&s;eeming the great mercy of God to this people, whom he vouch&s;afed to choo&s;e out of all the nations of the world, to be His peculiar people, to &s;uffer them to degenerate into Tartars, who are the mo&s;t vile and barbarous people up|on earth. It may be an&s;wered, that it may well con&s;i&s;t with that mo&s;t holy and perfect ju&s;tice, to aba&s;e &s;o wicked and rebellious a people again&s;t their God as the I&s;raelites were, and to ca&s;t them from the highe&s;t Heaven, to the lowe&s;t center of di&s;honor.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="030301_0017_0FE5AB8D13CB5E18">Others conjecture that the fir&s;t inhabitants of America were the ten tribes of the I&s;raelites, whom the Tartarians conquered and drove away.

<P>This conference being ended, the &s;ame men returned on Wedne&s;day and Thur&s;day, and re|peated the &s;ame things, without adding a word.

<P>Part of the ten tribes al&s;o live in Ethiopia in the Habi&s;&s;in kingdom, as divers of that country reported at Rome, and Boterus relates, that two potent nations dwell near the head of the river Nilus, one of which are I&s;raelites, who are gov|erned by a mighty king.

<HEAD><HI>IV.</HI> The &s;tate of the <HI>Jews</HI> after their extermination and the pre&s;ent condition of <HI>Pale&s;tine.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER the de&s;olation of Jeru&s;alem the Jews were di&s;per&s;ed throughout the world, and e&s;pecially in Spain, where the Em|peror Adrian commanded them to dwell; yet found every where &s;o little favour, that having divers times been put to grievous mulcts and ran&s;oms, they were all at la&s;t quite thru&s;t out of Europe.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Chri&s;tian prince that expelled the Jews out of his territories, was that heroick king Edw. I. who was &s;uch a fore &s;courge al&s;o to the
<PB N="55" REF="030301_0028_0FE5ABA93657F8D8">
Scots; and it is thought divers families of tho&s;e bani&s;hed Jews &s;led then to Scotland, where they have propagated &s;ince in great numbers; wit|ne&s;s the aver&s;ion this nation hath above others to hogs fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Nor was this their extermination for their re|ligion, but for their notorious crimes; as poi|&s;oning of wells, counterfeiting of coins, fal&s;ify|ing of &s;eals, crucifying of Chri&s;tian children, with other villanies. This happened in the year 1392. And &s;ixteen years after France followed our example. It was near two hundred years after that when Ferdinand turned them out of Spain; and five years after him, Emanuel of Portugal did the like.</P>
<P>But the countries from whence they were la&s;t expelled were Naples and Sicily, in the year 1539. In other parts of Chri&s;tendom they re|&s;ide yet in great numbers, as in Germany high and low, Bohemia, Lithuania, Poland and Ru&s;|&s;ia; in Italy al&s;o they are found, but in no coun|try &s;ubject to the king of Spain.</P>
<P>They live very quietly at Rome under the Pope's no&s;e, and St. Mark makes no &s;cruple to entertain them at Venice: in &s;undry places of the Ottoman Empire they are very numerous: &s;o that it is thought Con&s;tantinople and The&s;&s;a|lonica only have near twenty thou&s;and.</P>
<P>A&s;ia is full of them, as Aleppo, Trippoli, Da|ma&s;cus, Rhodes, and indeed all places of com|merce and traffick; there are numbers al&s;o in Per&s;ia, Arabia, and all over Cranganor in India.</P>
<P>In Africa they have their &s;ynagogues and

Lumbards, as in Alexandria, Grand Cairo, Fe&s;|&s;e, Treme&s;en, and divers places in the kingdom of Morocco. There are about one hundred families left in Jeru&s;alem, but the place where they are mo&s;t unmingled is Tiberias, which the Turks gave to Mendez the Jew for &s;ome &s;ignal &s;ervices; thither they oft bring or &s;end the bones of their dead friends, who have left large legacies, to be there interred from other places.</P>
<P>The city of Jeru&s;alem was afterwards re-edi|fied by Elius Adrianus, and given to the Chri&s;|tians, from whom it was taken by Co&s;roes and the Per&s;ians, in the year 615, and from them forcibly wre&s;ted by Hanmer, and the Saracens in 637. Next it fell into the power of Cutlu Mo&s;es, and the Turks in 1000, under who&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions when it had long groaned, Peter the Hermit &s;tirred up the We&s;tern princes to re|lieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, who&s;e de&s;igns at|tained their wi&s;hed effect, under the banner of the victorious prince Godfrey of Bullen, in the year 1093. This Godfrey, for his merits, was to have been inve&s;ted with the royal wreath of Maje&s;ty, which he denied, thinking it unfit to wear a crown of gold where his Saviour had worn a crown of thorns; yet for the common good he accepted the title; after whom reigned the&s;e Cri&s;tian princes, Baldwin the fir&s;t, Bald|win the &s;econd, Fulk, earl of Anjou, Baldwin the third, Almerick, Baldwin the fourth, Bald|win the fifth, Guy of Lu&s;ignad, the la&s;t king of Jeru&s;alem; during who&s;e time Saladine the &s;ul|tan of Egypt won the kingdom, which his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors

and hopeful &s;ign of the Jews conver&s;ion, and that will be glad tidings to the church of Chri&s;t, therefore I yield to &s;atisfy their de&s;ires, and thus it was.</P>
<P>At the place afore&s;aid there a&s;&s;embled about 300 Rabbies, called Jews, from &s;everal parts of the world, to examine the &s;criptures concerning Chri&s;t. It &s;eems this place was thought mo&s;t convenient for this council, in regard that part of the country is not much inhabited, becau&s;e of the continual wars between the Turks and the king of Hungary. There they have fought for|merly two bloody battles. Yet both the&s;e prin|ces, notwith&s;tanding their own differences, did give leave to the Jews to hold their council there. The Jews for their own accommodation, made divers tents for their repo&s;e, and had plenty of provi&s;ions brought them from other parts of the country, during the time of their &s;itting. The Jews making, as we &s;aid, divers tents, they &s;et up one large tent, only for the council to &s;it in, being made almo&s;t four &s;quare, the North and South not altogether &s;o large as the Ea&s;t and We&s;t part. It had but one door, and that open|ed to the Ea&s;t. In the middle of the tent there &s;tood a table, and a &s;tool for the propounder to &s;it on, with his face towards the door of the tent. The propounder was of the tribe of Levi, named Zacharias. And within this tent, round about were placed forms, on which &s;tood the re&s;t of the council. They were inclo&s;ed with a rail, at a di&s;tance from them, to prevent all &s;trangers and all &s;uch as could not prove them&s;elves to be Jews

And again, &s;ome of the&s;e Jews have burned the antient record of their tribes and families, that they might not be di&s;covered by &s;earching, or other ways. And for this defect; that they could not prove their tribes and family they were not permitted to come within the rails in the time of their council, but commanded to remain with the &s;trangers that attended to &s;ee the event of this a&s;&s;embly. We conceive the num|ber of people that attended to &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue of their preceedings were about three thou&s;and per|&s;ons. The mo&s;t part of them Germans, Alma|ine, Dalmatians, with &s;ome Greeks, and a few Italians, but not one Engli&s;hman more than my|&s;elf; for I was informed that the king of Hun|gary not favouring the reformed religion, did give no encouragement to any prote&s;tant church to &s;end a divine thither. But he did allow there &s;hould be &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;ent from Rome; and
<PB N="101" REF="030301_0051_0FE5AC1B2DECA720">
their coming hither proved a great unhappine&s;s to this hopeful a&s;&s;embly, or council.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day, when the a&s;&s;embly fir&s;t met, they &s;pent &s;ome time in mutual &s;alutations, and as their manner is, ki&s;&s;ed one another's cheeks, expre&s;&s;ing great joy for their happy meeting. And now all things being prepared for their ac|commodation, they con&s;idered of the Jews that were to be admitted for members of this council, for they only were admitted members, that could by record prove them&s;elves to be native Jews. And I ob&s;erved, there were about five hundred refu&s;ed, and put by, though doubtle&s;s they were true Jews, yet they could not by record prove them&s;elves &s;o to be. The number accepted was about three hundred; and thus the bu&s;ine&s;s of the fir&s;t day clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day, the a&s;&s;embly being full, the propounder Zacharias, of the tribe of Levi &s;tood up, and made a &s;peech concerning the end of their meeting. And this, &s;aid he, is to examine the &s;criptures concerning Chri&s;t, whether he be already come, or whether we are to expect his coming? In examining this que&s;tion, they &s;ear|ched the Old te&s;tament with great care and la|bor mo&s;t part of that day, to be re&s;olved in the truth, having bibles to that end. About which point began a di&s;pute that la&s;ted many hours, which at last lead to this conclu&s;ion, that the ma|jor part of this a&s;&s;embly were of opinion that Chri&s;t was not come. But &s;ome others of the a&s;&s;embly having &s;trictly examined the &s;criptures, and finding them &s;o plain for his coming, were
<PB N="102" REF="030301_0052_0FE5AC189D6C16D8">
inclined to think that Chri&s;t was come, being the rather &s;o moved to think, by the con&s;idera|tion of the great judgments that have been upon them the&s;e 1600 years; they imputed the de&s;|truction and long afflictions of their nation to the wickedne&s;s they had been guilty of, and one of their greate&s;t &s;ins, they &s;aid, was the &s;pilling the blood of the Prophet &s;ent from God to their na|tion, and ma&s;&s;acring tho&s;e who believed the doctrines he taught. For, &s;aid they, we are no idolaters, and therefore we have not had this heavy judgement upon us for that; but &s;ure|ly it is for the &s;pilling the blood of Je&s;us, the prophet &s;ent from God, and for ma&s;&s;acring tho&s;e that loved him. And this was the &s;um of what was di&s;puted the &s;econd day of their meeting, and &s;o they cea&s;ed until the next morning.</P>
<P>The third day, being a&s;&s;embled together a|gain, the point chiefly agitated was concerning the manner of Chri&s;t's coming; and that (they &s;aid) &s;hould be like a mighty prince, in the pow|er and authority of a king; yea, in greater pow|er than ever any king had, and that he will de|liver their nation out of the power of their ad|ver&s;aries, and re&s;tore them to their kingdom a|gain: and that the nations &s;hall be of their reli|gion when&s;oever he cometh; and therefore be|gan to conclude that Chri&s;t was not come. For Je&s;us, &s;aid they, the great prophet, when he came, began to alter our religion, therefore h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is not the true Me&s;&s;iah. And f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rther, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Je&s;us came, whom &s;ome call the true Me&s;&s;ias, he began pre&s;ently to pluck down our religion, and
<PB N="103" REF="030301_0052_0FE5AC189D6C16D8">
&s;et up his own, therefore he was not the true Me&s;&s;iah. Thus &s;ome of them concluded, and &s;ome did not. But they went from this di&s;pute to another, concerning his parentage, they did all agree in this, that he &s;hall be born of a virgin, according to the predictions of the prophets in the Old Te&s;tament. And in this al&s;o, that he &s;hould be born of a virgin of mean note and pa|rentage among their nation, as was the virgin Mary that bare Je&s;us, the great prophet from God. And upon this many of them &s;eemed to think that Chri&s;t was come: but left it to next day, when they &s;hould again meet together.</P>
<P>The fourth day, the a&s;&s;embly being met, the propounder demanded what they thought, whe|ther Chri&s;t was come, or not ? they &s;aid, they thought he was come; but they an&s;wered this, that if he were come, he was no other than Eli|as; becau&s;e Elias was formerly in great power, and with great power he declared it, in &s;laying the prie&s;ts of Baal, and for fulfilling the &s;crip|tures he was oppo&s;ed by Ahab and Jezebel. And &s;o they e&s;teemed this man, whom they called Je|&s;us, to be that &s;ame Elias. Moreover, others &s;aid, that they thought he was more than a mor|tal man, in that he &s;o &s;trangely a&s;cended up into Heaven, which &s;ome of our forefathers &s;aw; and this was all that was done on the fourth day.</P>
<P>The fifth day, the a&s;&s;embly being met, they went about the &s;ame que&s;tion that was contro|verted the day before, and took into examination again, to an&s;wer them that &s;aid Elias was not the Me&s;&s;iah. They of the contrary opinion, did
<PB N="104" REF="030301_0053_0FE5AC44E35CA878">
argue the love and care of Elias for the good of their nation: that he left them Eli&s;ha his di&s;ciple to teach and in&s;truct the people, and this they took to be the care of the Me&s;&s;iah. The&s;e were their chief arguments to maintain their opinion: the &s;ame day towards night came into que&s;tion among them, what then he was that &s;aid, he was the &s;on of God, and was crucified by their ance&s;tors; but becau&s;e this was a great que&s;tion among them, they deferred the farther co&s;idera|tion thereof until the next day.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth day, there were &s;ome Phari&s;ees that &s;tood up, who were the great enemies of Chri&s;t and &s;aid, they would undertake to an&s;wer the la&s;t que&s;tion; and would by no means yield that he was the Chri&s;t. And the&s;e are the rea|&s;ons they give for their opinion, viz. 1. Becau&s;e he came into the world like an ordinary and in|ferior man; not with his &s;cepter and royal pow|er; for they affirmed, that the coming of Chri&s;t would be glorious. 2. They pleaded again&s;t him, the meanne&s;s of his birth, in that his fa|ther was a carpenter, and this (they &s;aid) was a di&s;honour of which, when Chri&s;t comes he will not be capable. 3. They accu&s;ed him to be a fal&s;e Chri&s;t, and an enemy to Mo&s;es' law, in doing and &s;uffering his di&s;ciples to do unlawful works on the Sabbath day. For they believed (they &s;aid) that the true Me&s;&s;iah will exactly keep the law of Mo&s;es. Now, though it were replied, that the Go&s;pel doth te&s;tify of Chri&s;t; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> he did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l the law of Mo&s;es, yet they re|jected that an&s;wer, becau&s;e they did not believe,
<PB N="105" REF="030301_0053_0FE5AC44E35CA878">
and own the go&s;pel. But the&s;e rea&s;ons did not &s;atisfy the council.</P>
<P>So that, after the Phari&s;ees had done &s;peak|ing, there &s;tood up one Rabbi Abraham, and objected again&s;t the Phari&s;ees, the myracles that Chri&s;t wrought while he was on earth, viz. The rai&s;ing of dead to life again; his making the lame to walk; the blind to &s;ee; the dumb to &s;peak; by what power, I pray you, my breth|ren, did he them? With that the Phari&s;ees aro&s;e, and de&s;ired to an&s;wer him; and this is the an&s;|wer they returned to the council: Perhaps, &s;aid they, this Je&s;us was an impo&s;tor, and magician, and &s;o was enabled to do tho&s;e miracles. And for our parts, we believe, that all the miracles he did were done by magick and charms, where|by they were re&s;tored to their former condition again. But this an&s;wer gave little &s;atisfaction to the council, and e&s;pecially to Abraham: whereupon Abraham &s;tood up, and replied, How could this Chri&s;t charm the blind, lame, and dumb, &amp;c. when they were &s;o born before Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf was born, as it appeared &s;ame of them were? This &s;eemed a paradox to the Phari&s;ees. And truly, the pro&s;ecuting of this argument almo&s;t put the Phari&s;ees to a non|plus, but at la&s;t they began to &s;peak again, and gave this an&s;wer, though a weak and vile one; Perhaps, &s;ay they, the &s;aid impotent per&s;ons were made &s;o by other magicians, and conjured to be lame, blind, and dumb, &amp;c. And though him&s;elf were not then born when they were born with those evils, yet this Je&s;us being a great di&s;|&s;embler,
<PB N="106" REF="030301_0054_0FE5AC1ECADF4F58">
and more cunning than any magician before him, power was given him by the devil to remove tho&s;e charms which others had pla|ced. But there Eas one Phari&s;ee among th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;t, named Zebedee, who among all the Pha|ri&s;ees there a&s;&s;embled, did more opprobriou&s;ly and bla&s;phemou&s;ly revile Chri&s;t, and vehement|ly urged tho&s;e things to the council, again&s;t him; but, I conceive, not to the well liking of any that heard him, even to the members of the council, or of the Phari&s;ees. And as the Phari|&s;ees played their part again&s;t Chri&s;t, &s;o did the Saducees likewi&s;e: for &s;ome of the council were of that &s;ect, who did endeavour to render Chri&s;t vile and odious to the re&s;t of the Jews.</P>

<P>In the heat of all this talk and rumour comes Sabatai Sevi to Smyrna, the city of his nativity, infinitely de&s;ired there by the common Jews; but by the chochams, or doctors of their law, who gave little or no credence to what he pretended, was ill received, not knowing what mi&s;chief or ruin this doctrine and prophecy of a new kingdom might produce.

<PB N="118" REF="030301_0060_0FE5AC40AE001B98">
whom the arguments grew &s;o high and language &s;o hot, that the Jews who favoured the doctrine of Sabatai, and feared the authority of the cho|chams, doubtful what might be the i&s;&s;ue of the conte&s;t, appeared in great numbers before the Cadi of Smyrna, in ju&s;tification of the new prophet, before &s;o much as any accu&s;ation came again&s;t him.

the greatne&s;s and dominion of the Me&s;&s;iah, pro|ceeds to an election of tho&s;e princes which are to govern the I&s;raelites in their march towards the holy land, and to di&s;pen&s;e judgment and ju&s;|tice after their re&s;toration. The names of them were well known at Smyrna, who never (God knows) had ambition to a&s;pire to the title of princes, until a &s;trange &s;pirit of deceit and delu|&s;ion had moved them, not only to hope for it as po&s;&s;ible, but to expect it as certain.</P>
<P>In this manner things ran to &s;trange height of madne&s;s among the Jews ot Smyrna, where ap|peared &s;uch pegeantry of greatne&s;s, that no co|medy could equal the mock-&s;hews they repre|&s;ented; and though none dur&s;t openly profe&s;s a|ny &s;cruple, or doubt of this common received belief, yet for confirmation of the Jews in their faith, and a&s;toni&s;hment of the Gentiles, it was judged no le&s;s than nece&s;&s;ary, that Sabatai &s;hould &s;hew &s;ome miracles whereby to convince all the world that he was the true Me&s;&s;iah; and as the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion &s;eemed to require an evi|dence infallible of this truth, &s;o it was daily ex|pected by the vulgar, with an impatience &s;uitable to humours di&s;po&s;ed to novelty; who out of every action of their prophet, began to fancy &s;omething extraordinary and &s;upernatural. Sab|batai was now horribly puzzled for a miracle, though the imagination of the people was &s;o vi|tiated that any legerdemain, or &s;light of hand would have pa&s;&s;ed more ea&s;y with them for a wonder than Mo&s;es &s;triking the rock for water, or dividing the red &s;ea; and an occa&s;ion hap|pening
<PB N="121" REF="030301_0061_0FE5AC34D0251E20">
that Sabatai was, in behalf of his &s;ubjects, to appear before the Cadi, or judge of the city, to demand ea&s;e and relief of &s;ome oppre&s;&s;ions which aggrieved them; it was thought nece&s;&s;ary a mir|acle &s;hould be now or never, when Sabatai ap|pearing with a formal and phari&s;aical gravity which he had &s;tarched on, &s;ome on a &s;udden a|vouched to &s;ee a pillar of fire between him and the Cadi, which report pre&s;ently was heard thro' the whole room, filled with Jews that eccom|panied Sabatai, &s;ome of whom who &s;trongly fancied it, vowed and &s;wore they &s;aw it; others in the outward yard, or that could not come near to hear, or &s;ee, for the crowd, as &s;peedily took the alarm, and the rumour ran and receiv|ed belief of the women and childred at home in a moment, &s;o that Sabatai Sevi returned to his hou&s;e triumphant, fixed in the hearts of his peo|ple, who now needed no farther miracles to con|firm them in their faith. Sabatai Sevi having thus fully fixed him&s;elf in Smyrna, and filled other places with rumours of his fame, declar|ing that he was called by God to vi&s;it Con&s;tan|tinople, where the greate&s;t part of his work was to be accompli&s;hed. In order, whereunto he privately &s;hipped him&s;elf, with &s;ome few atten|dants.</P>
<P>The wind proving northerly, as commonly it is in the Helle&s;pont and Propontus, Sabatai was thirty nine days in his voyage, &s;o little pow|er had this Me&s;&s;iah over the &s;ea and winds; in which time news being come to Con&s;tantinople that the Jews Me&s;&s;iah was near, all that people
<PB N="122" REF="030301_0062_0FE5AC333B5E0F20">
prepared to receive him with the &s;ame joy and impatience as was expre&s;&s;ed in other parts where he arrived, the grand vizier (then al&s;o at Con&s;tantinople, being not yet departed on his expedition for Candia) having heard &s;ome ru|mours of this man, and the di&s;order and mad|ne&s;s he had rai&s;ed among the Jews, &s;ent two boats, whil&s;t the Salack was detained by contra|ry winds, with commands to bring him up pri&s;|oner to the port, where accordingly Sabatai be|ing come, was confined in the mo&s;t loath&s;ome dungeon in the town, there to remain in farther expectation of the vizier's &s;entence. The Jews were not at all di&s;couraged at this treatment of their prophet, but rather confirmed in their belief of him, as being the accompli&s;hment of the prophecy of tho&s;e things which ought to proceed his glory and dominion; which con&s;ideration induced the chiefe&s;t per&s;ons among the Jews to make their vi&s;its and addre&s;&s;es to him, with the &s;ame ceremony and re&s;pect in the dungeon, as they would have done had he then &s;at exalted on the throne of I&s;rael:</P>
<P>The Jews in Con&s;tantinople were now be|come as m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d and di&s;tracted as they were in o|ther places, all trade and traffick forbidden, and tho&s;e who owed money, in no manner careful how to &s;atisfy it: among&s;t which wild crew &s;ome were indebted to our merchants at Galata, who not knowing the way to receive their money, partly for their intere&s;t, and partly for curio&s;ity, thought fit to vi&s;it this Sabatai, complaining, that &s;uch particular Jews upon his coming, took
<PB N="123" REF="030301_0062_0FE5AC333B5E0F20">
upon them the boldne&s;s to defraud them of their right, and de&s;ired he would &s;ignify to the&s;e his &s;ubjects his plea&s;ure to have &s;atisfaction given: whereupon Sabatai with much affection took pen and paper and wrote to this effect.</P>
<P>In this manner Sabatai Sevi remained a pri&s;|oner at Con&s;tantinople for the &s;pace of two months: at the end of which the Vizier having &s;ignified his expedition for Candia, and con&s;ider|ing the rumour and di&s;turbance the pre&s;ence of Sabatai had made already at Con&s;tantinople, though it not &s;ecure to &s;uffer him to remain in the imperial city, whil&s;t both the Grand Seignior and him&s;elf were ab&s;ent: and therefore changes his pri&s;on to the Dardanelli. This removal of Sabatai from a wor&s;e pri&s;on to one of a better air, confirmed the Jews with a greater confi|dence of his being the Me&s;&s;iah, &s;uppo&s;ing that had it been in the power of the Vizier to have de&s;troyed his per&s;on, he would never have per|mitted him to have lived to that time, in regard their maxims enforce them to end all jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions of ruin to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, by the death of the party feared, which much rather they ought to execute on Sabatai, who had not only declared him&s;elf the king of I&s;rael, but al&s;o pub|li&s;hed prophecies fatal to the Grand Seignior and his kingdoms.</P>
<P>With this con&s;ideration, and others proceed|ing, the Jews flock in great numbers to the ca&s;|tle, where he was impri&s;oned, not only from the neighbouring parts, but al&s;o from Poland, Germany, Leghorn, Venice, Am&s;terdam, and
<PB N="124" REF="030301_0063_0FE5990187993890">
other places where the Jews re&s;ide: on all whom as a reward of the expence and labours of their pilgrimage, Sabatai be&s;towed plenty of his ben|edictions, promi&s;ing increa&s;e of their &s;tore, and enlargement of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the Holy Land. And &s;o great was the confluence of the Jews to this place, that the Turks thought it requi&s;ite to make their advantage thereof, and &s;o not only rai&s;ed the price of their provi&s;ions, lodgings, and other nece&s;&s;aries, but al&s;o denied to admit any to the pre&s;ence of Sabatai, unle&s;s for money, &s;et|ting the price &s;ometimes at five, &s;ometimes at ten dollars more or le&s;s, according as they gue&s;|&s;ed at their abilities, or zeal for the per&s;on, by which gain and advantage to the Turks no com|plaints or advices was carried to Adrianople, ei|ther of the concour&s;e of people or arguments a|mong&s;t the Jews in that place, but rather all ci|vilities and liberty indulged unto them, which &s;erved as a farther argument to en&s;nare this poor people in the belief of their Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P>The devotion of the Jews toward this pretend|ed Me&s;&s;iah increa&s;ed &s;till more and more, &s;o that not only the chief of the city went to attend and proffer their &s;ervice towards him in the time of his impri&s;onment, but likewi&s;e decked their &s;yn|agogue with S. S. in letters of gold, making for him on the wall a crown, in the circle of which was wrote the 91&s;t P&s;alm at length in fair and legible characters; attributing the &s;ame titles to Sabatai, and expounding the &s;criptures in the &s;ame manner in favor of his appearance, as we do of our Saviour. However, &s;ome of the Jews
<PB N="125" REF="030301_0063_0FE5990187993890">
remained in their wits all this time, among&s;t which was a certain Chocham at Smyrna, one zealous of his law, and of the good and &s;afety of his nation, and ob&s;erving in what a wild man|ner the whole people of the Jews was tran&s;por|ted, with the groundle&s;s belief of a Me&s;&s;iah, leav|ing not only their trade, and cour&s;e of living, but publi&s;hing prophecies of a &s;peedy kingdom, of re&s;cue from the tyranny of the Turks, and leading the Grand Seignior him&s;elf captive in chains: matters &s;o dangerous and obnoxious to the &s;tate wherein they lived, as might ju&s;tly con|vict them of trea&s;on and rebellion, and leave them to the mercy of that ju&s;tice, which on the lea&s;t jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion of matters of this nature, u&s;es to extirpate families, and &s;ubvert the man&s;ion hou&s;es of their own people, much ra|ther of the Jews, on whom the Turks would gladly take occa&s;ion to di&s;poil them of their e&s;|tates, and condemn the whole nation to perpet|ual &s;lavery.</P>
<P>This chocham &s;o enraged and &s;candalized the Jews, that they judged no condemnation or puni&s;hment too &s;evere again&s;t &s;uch an offender and bla&s;phemer of their law, and holine&s;s of the Me&s;&s;iah: and therefore with money and pre&s;ents to the Cadi accu&s;ing him as di&s;obedient in a capi|tal manner to their government, obtained &s;en|tence again&s;t him, to have his beard &s;haved, and to be condemned to the gallies. There wanted nothing now to the appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah, and the &s;olemnity of his coming, but the pre|&s;ence of Elias; whom the Jews began to expect
<PB N="126" REF="030301_0064_0FE5AC3E220A4B60">
hourly, and with that intention and earne&s;tne&s;s, that every dream or phanta&s;m to a weak head was judged to be Elias; it being taught and a|verred, that he was &s;een in divers forms and &s;hapes, not to be certainly di&s;covered or known before the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah; for the &s;u|per&s;tition is &s;o far fixed among&s;t them, that ge|nerally in their families they &s;pread a table for Elias the prophet to which they make an invita|tion of poor people, leaving the chief place for the Lord Elias, whom they believe to be invi&s;i|bly pre&s;ent at the entertainment, and there to eat and drink without diminution, either of the di&s;hes or of the cup.</P>
<P>This being the common opinion among the Jews, and that Sabatai Sevi was the Me&s;&s;iah, be|ing become an article of faith, it was not hard to per&s;uade them that Elias was come already, that they met with him in their di&s;hes, in the dark, in their bed chambers, or any where el&s;e invi&s;i|ble, in the &s;ame manner as common people of England believe of hobgoblins and fairies.</P>
<P>For &s;o it was when Solomon Cremona, an inhabitant of Smyrna, making a great fea&s;t, to which the principal Jews of the city were invit|ed, after they had eaten and drank freely, one &s;tarts from his &s;eat, and avouches that he &s;aw Elias upon the wall, and with that bows to him and compliments him with all reverence and hu|mility; &s;ome others having in like manner their fancies prepared to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;hadows immedi|ately agreed upon the object, and then there was not one in the company who would &s;ay he
<PB N="127" REF="030301_0064_0FE5AC3E220A4B60">
did not &s;ee him: at which &s;urprize every one was &s;truck with reverence and awe; and the mo&s;t eloquent among&s;t them having their tongues loo&s;ed with joy and wine, directed orations, en|comiums, and acts of thankfulne&s;s to Elias, cour|ting and complimenting him as di&s;tracted lovers do the &s;uppo&s;ed pre&s;ence of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But to return again to Sabatai Sevi him&s;elf, we find him &s;till remaning a pri&s;oner in the ca&s;|tle of Abydos, upon the Helle&s;pont, admired and adored by his brethren with more honour than before, and vi&s;ited by pilgrims from all parts, where the fame of the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah had arrived: among&s;t which one from Poland, named Nehemiah Cohen, was of &s;pe|cial note and renown learned in the Hebrew, Syriack and Chaldee, and ver&s;ed in the doctrine and cavals of the Rabbins, as well as Sabatai him&s;elf, one (of whom it was &s;aid) had not this Sevi anticipated the de&s;ign, e&s;teemed him&s;elf a notable fellow, to act the part of a Me&s;&s;iah as the other: How&s;oever, it being too late to pub|li&s;h any &s;uch pretence, Sabatai having now ele|ven points of the law by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the office, and with that the hearts and belief of the Jews, Nehemiah was contented with &s;ome &s;mall ap|pendage, or relation to the Me&s;&s;iah; and there|fore to lay his de&s;ign the better de&s;ired a private conference with Sabatai; the&s;e two great Rab+bins being together, a hot di&s;pute aro&s;e be|tween them; for Cohen alledged, that accor|ding to &s;cripture, and expo&s;ition of the learn|ed thereupon, there were to be two Me&s;&s;iahs,
<PB N="128" REF="030301_0065_0FE5AC1CE05B0CF0">
one called Ben Ephraim, and the other Ben David; the fir&s;t was to be a preacher of the law, poor, de&s;pi&s;ed, a &s;ervant and forerunner to the &s;econd, who was to be great and rich, to re&s;tore the Jews, to &s;it upon the throne of David, and to perform all the wonders expected from Sabatai. Nehemiah was contented to be Ephraim, the af|flicted and poor Me&s;&s;iah, and Sabatai was willing he &s;hould be &s;o; but that Nehemiah accu&s;ed him for being too forward in publi&s;hing him&s;elf the former Me&s;&s;iah, before Ben Ephraim had fir&s;t been known unto the world. Sabatai took this reprehen&s;ion &s;o ill, either out of pride of his own infallibility, or he &s;u&s;pected that Nehemiah being once admitted for Ben Ephraim (being a &s;ubtle and learned per&s;on) would per&s;uade the world that he was Ben David, would by no means admit of this new doctrine; and thereupon the di&s;pute grew &s;o hot, and irreconcileable, as was taken notice of by the Jews, and controverted by them as every one fancied. But Sabatai being of greater authority, his &s;entence prevailed, and Nehemiah was rejected as an enemy to the Me&s;|&s;iah, which afterwards proved the downfall of this impo&s;tor. For Nehemiah being thus baffled, and being a per&s;on of authority, and haughty &s;pirit, meditated nothing but revenge; to exe|cute which, he takes a journey to Adrianople, and there informs the chief mini&s;ters of &s;tate, who, by rea&s;on of the gain the Turks made of their pri&s;oner, heard nothing of him, or of the prophecies&mdash;and taking likewi&s;e to his council certain di&s;contented and unbelieving chochams,
<PB N="129" REF="030301_0065_0FE5AC1CE05B0CF0">
who being jealous of the con&s;equences of this increa&s;ing madne&s;s, took liberty to inform the chocham who was deputy of the great vizier, that the Jew, pri&s;oner at the ca&s;tle, called Sabatai Sevi, was a lewd per&s;on, and one who endeavor|ed to debauch the minds of the Jews, and divert them from their hone&s;t cour&s;e of livelihood, and obedience to the grand Signior; and that there|fore it was nece&s;&s;ary to clear the world of &s;o fac|tious and dangerous a &s;pirit. The chocham being thus informed, could do no le&s;s than acquaint the grand &s;eignior, who in&s;tantly di&s;patched a chi|aux (me&s;&s;enger) to bring up Sabatai to Adrino|ple. The chiaux executed his commi&s;&s;ion after the Turki&s;h fa&s;hion, and without ceremony hur|ried Sabatai to Adrinople, not even affording him time to take a &s;olemn farewel of his di&s;ciples, who were now come to the vertical point of all their hopes and expectations.</P>
<P>The Grand Seignior having received by this time divers informations of the madne&s;s of the Jews, and the pretence of Sabatai, grew big with de&s;ire and expectation to &s;ee him: &s;o that he no &s;ooner arrived at Adrinople, but the &s;ame hour he was brought before the Grand Seignior; Sabatai appeared much dejected, and failing of that courage which he &s;hewed in the &s;ynagogue; and being demanded &s;everal que&s;|tions by the grand &s;eignior, he would not tru&s;t &s;o far to the virtue of his Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip, as to deliver him&s;elf in the Turki&s;h language, but de&s;ired a doctor of phy&s;ic, who had from a Jew turned Turk, to be his interpreter, which was granted to
<PB N="130" REF="030301_0066_0FE5AC3168E89090">
him, but not without reflection of the &s;tanders by, that had he been the Me&s;&s;iah, his tongue would have flown with a variety, as well as with the perfection of languages. But the grand &s;eig|nior would not be put off without a miracle, and it mu&s;t be one of his own choice; which was; that Sabatai &s;hould be &s;tripped naked, and &s;et as a mark to his archers: if the arrows pierced not his body, then he would believe him to be the Me&s;&s;iah. But Sabatai not having faith to &s;tand &s;o &s;harp a trial, renounced all his title to kingdoms and governments, alledging that he was but an ordinary chocham, and a poor Jew, as others were, and had nothing of privilege, or virtue a|bove the re&s;t. But the grand &s;eignior not being fully &s;atisfied with this plain confe&s;&s;ion, declared, that having given public &s;candal to the profe&s;&s;ors of the Mehometan religion, and done di&s;honor to his &s;overeign authority, by pretending to draw &s;uch a con&s;iderable portion from him as the land of Pale&s;tine; his trea&s;on and crime were not to be expatiated but by a conver&s;ion to the Meho|metan faith, which if he refu&s;ed, the &s;take was ready at the gate of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">raglio to impale him.</P>
<P>Sabatai being now reduced to extremity, yet not doubtful what to do, for to die for what he knew to be fal&s;e would be the death of a mad man; replied with much chearfulne&s;s, that he was contented to turn a Turk, and that it was not of force, but of choice, having been a long time de&s;irous of &s;o glorious a profe&s;&s;ion: he e&s;|teemed him&s;elf much honored, that he had an op|portunity to own it fir&s;t in the prefence of the

<P>During the time of all the&s;e tran&s;actions, the Jews of Smyrna, &amp;c. leaving their traffic, filled their letters for Italy, and other parts, with nothing but wonders and miracles wrought by their fal&s;e Me&s;&s;iah. As that when the Grand Seignior &s;ent to take him, he cau&s;ed all the me&s;|&s;engers immediatly to die, upon which other janizaries being again &s;ent, they all fell dead with only a word from his mouth; and being de&s;ired to revive them again, he immediately recalled them to life. After this they added, that he went voluntarily to pri&s;on, and though the gates were barred and &s;hut with &s;trong locks of iron, yet that Sabatai was &s;een to walk through the &s;treets with a numerous attendance: and when they laid &s;hackles on his neck and feet, they not only fell from him, but were converted into gold, with which he gratified his true and faithful believers and di&s;ciples. Some miracles al&s;o were reported of Nathan, that only at rea|ding the name of any particular man or woman, he would immediately recount the &s;tory of his or her life, their &s;ins or defaults, and accordingly impo&s;e ju&s;t correction and penance for them.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;trong reports coming thus confidently into Italy and all parts, the Jews of Ca&s;el in Mont&s;errato re&s;olved to &s;end three par&s;ons in be|half of their &s;ociety, in the nature of extraordina|ry legates to Smyrna, to make inquiry after the truth of all the&s;e rumours.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="030301_0067_0FE5AC56C163D5C0">At length Nathan arrives near Smyrna, on Friday the third of March, towards evening and on Sunday the&s;e legates made their vi&s;it to him; but Nathan, upon news of the change of his be loved Me&s;&s;iah, began to grow &s;ullen and re&s;er|ved, &s;o that the legates could &s;carce procure ad|mittance to him; all they could do was to in|form him that they had a letter to him from the brotherhood of Italy, and commi&s;&s;ion to confer with him concerning the foundation and authori|ty he had for his prophecies; but Nathan refu&s;ed to take the letter; &s;o that the legates returned ill contented, but yet with hope at Nathan's arrival at Smyrna to receive better &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means Nathan being di&s;appointed of his wandering progre&s;s, and a&s;hamed of the event of things, contrary to his prophecies, re&s;olved to return again, and not to enter Smyrna. And thus the emba&s;&s;y of the&s;e legates was concluded, and they returned to the place from whence they came, and the Jews again to their wits, follow|ing their trade of merchandize and brokerage as formerly, with more quiet advantage. The&s;e matters were tran&s;acted in the years 1665 and 1666, &s;ince which Sabatai hath pa&s;&s;ed his time devoutly in the Ottoman court.</P>
<P>Sabatai Sevi continued in the hou&s;e of the grand &s;eignior until the year 1676, and then died.</P>
