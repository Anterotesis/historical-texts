<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE following account of the erection of a Poor-hou&s;e, in the pari&s;h of Boldre, in New-Fore&s;t, is intended to &s;hew, how cheaply, and yet how comfortably, the poor of a pari&s;h may be maintained, with good management, under the pre&s;ent poor laws.</P>
<P>The old poor-hou&s;e of Boldre being a wretched place, and managed without any economy, at a great expence; it was determined, at a ve&s;try held in the year 1792, to build a new one on a better &s;ite; to put in a re&s;pectable ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s; and to give the overlooking of it to a monthly Committee of the gentlemen and farmers of the pari&s;h.</P>
<P>Accordingly they borrowed the &s;um of 800<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and bought a piece of ground, about two acres and an half; elevated, dry, and airy; here they built their hou&s;e, at a little di&s;tance from the
<PB N="4" REF="032194_0003_0FF17DB128D4C240">road; and yet near enough to be under the con|&s;tant eye of ob&s;ervation. It is built &s;ub&s;tancially of brick, &s;ingle, that the air may have a free pa&s;|&s;age through it, and extending about eighty-two feet in front, and twenty in breadth. The&s;e di|men&s;ions give an excellent work-room on the right, as you enter; and on the left a kitchen and back kitchen; the ma&s;ter's room, which is al&s;o the Committee-room, about eighteen feet by four|teen, occupies the centre, and has a window on one &s;ide, in&s;pecting the work-room; and another on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, in&s;pecting the kitchen; above &s;tairs, the &s;leeping chambers are &s;eparated nearly as tho&s;e are below; only, as there are commonly more women and children in a poor-hou&s;e than men, a room at the end of the mens' apartment is taken off for a &s;ick room, with a &s;eparate &s;tair|ca&s;e; above the chambers are excellent garrets; behind the kitchen-part of the hou&s;e, are the pan|tries and other conveniences, among which is a &s;tore-room thirty feet long.</P>
<P>The ground between the hou&s;e and the road, which is a falling &s;pace of about &s;ixty yards, is divided, fir&s;t into a dry convenient play-yard for the children; and the remainder, about half an acre, running down to the road, is a garden; the
<PB N="5" REF="032194_0004_0FF17DB5590A1C48">larger garden, which is about an acre, lies behind the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es being thus erected and &s;ufficiently dry, the inhabitants of the old hou&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of nine or ten men and women, and between twenty and thirty children, were brought into it, on the 19th of May, 1793; and the whole put under the care of Mr. and Mrs. Salter, who&s;e characters will hereafter be &s;hewn at large in the excellent ma|nagement of every part of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>A more di&s;orderly &s;et in every particular, than this family was, when Mr. Salter received it fir&s;t under his care, cannot ea&s;ily be conceived: when he had brought them a little into order, and &s;hewn them it was his wi&s;h to be kind and friendly to them; he got them, by degrees, to go on regular|ly in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and duties of the hou&s;e. Both he and his wife are well acquainted with the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;pinning and weaving; and hav|ing &s;et up a couple of looms, and a number of &s;pinning wheels, he generally pre&s;ides over this part of the bu&s;ine&s;s him&s;elf, and Mrs. Salter over the economy and management of the hou&s;e; both departments are admirably conducted. The in|habitants are all employed in that bu&s;ine&s;s they are mo&s;t fit for: &s;ome of the old women in cook|ing,
<PB N="6" REF="032194_0005_0FF17DB82BF87070">mending, and wa&s;hing; the old men in the garden; the children and &s;ome of the women in &s;pinning, and weaving; children, even of four or five years of age are employed, and earn about a penny a day. In &s;ummer they come to the work|room at &s;ix; in winter as &s;oon as it is light; at breakfa&s;t they have an hour's re&s;pite, and the &s;ame at dinner; they have all ta&s;ks, which are &s;o ea&s;y, that if they work hard, they can fini&s;h them by two in the afternoon; but without any exer|tion by &s;ix.</P>
<P>With regard to their food; on <HI>Sunday</HI> they have beef, pork, or veal, as each happens to be cheap|e&s;t, with plenty of vegetables, and four ounces of bread for grown per&s;ons, and three for children; on <HI>Monday,</HI> they have the remains warmed with vegetables and bread; on <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> each grown per&s;on has a pound of pudding, and the children three quarters of a pound; on <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> beef, or pork, or veal, as on Sunday; on <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> the remains as on Monday; on <HI>Friday,</HI> they have generally &s;oup made of a bullock's head, with vegetables and bread, as u&s;ual; on <HI>Saturday,</HI> a clearance is made of all the remains in the hou&s;e; and if they fall &s;hort, the deficiency is made up with bread and chee&s;e; for breakfa&s;t, beef-broth, or milk-broth is provided; and at &s;up|per
<PB N="7" REF="032194_0006_0FF17DBA0F2B4148">the regular meal is &s;ix ounces of bread, and an ounce of chee&s;e for every grown per&s;on; and for children, four ounces of bread, and three quarters of an ounce of chee&s;e; this is &s;ometimes varied with potatoes, which the children like bet|ter; every thing is good in its kind: the children &s;eldom eat up all they are helped to, and the re|mainder is fryed up again the next day among the <HI>remains.</HI> During the pre&s;ent &s;carcity of bread-corn, Mrs. Salter hath u&s;ed a le&s;s proportion of wheat, and a larger of potatoes, particularly for &s;upper. During the winter of the year 1795, &s;he boiled potatoes and onions, and mixing them well together, fryed them with a little lard; the peo|ple were in general fonder of this di&s;h than of their u&s;ual meal.</P>
<P>Four bu&s;hels and a half of malt are allowed each month for beer. I mu&s;t add, that the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s generally fare as the family does, though it is not required by the Committee.</P>
<P>The clothing of the poor is equally good; every one has a new &s;uit for Sunday, generally &s;pun and woven in the hou&s;e. It is carefully hung up at night, and the old clothes produced for the week.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="032194_0007_0FF17DBBEA1285E8">
Thus the poor are well lodged, well fed, and well clothed; and yet, on deducting their earn|ings, at le&s;s than half the expence they co&s;t the pari&s;h before. Their food, upon an average, is &s;carcely ever e&s;timated at &s;o much as nine pence a head weekly; whereas in the old hou&s;e, with continual complaint, the allowance was ju&s;t dou|ble; though provi&s;ions, at that time, were much cheaper than they are now</P>
<P>In the article of clothing, much more is &s;aved. Though the poor are now &s;o decently clad, yet by care and management, the whole expence of the clothing this la&s;t year, including &s;hoes, a|mounted only to 17<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>s</ABBR> 8<ABBR>d.</ABBR> whereas the expence of cloathing the poor in the old hou&s;e, did not amount to le&s;s, one year with another, than 70<ABBR>l.</ABBR> annually. In one year it reached 90<ABBR>l.</ABBR> And this might po&s;&s;ibly be without any di&s;hone&s;ty on the part of the pari&s;h-officers; for as there was no care taken to keep the clothes in repair, nor any di&s;tinction made between old and new, the poor were always in rags, and yet always craving for new clothes.</P>
<P>Another great &s;aving, where there is a well regulated hou&s;e, is made in the article of <HI>out-doors-poor.</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="032194_0008_0FF17DC00123BB98">There are numbers of people in every pari&s;h, who are too proud to go into a poor-hou&s;e, or may perhaps be under no nece&s;&s;ity, who are yet very ready to receive a weekly dole of a &s;hilling, or eighteen pence a week: their plea is, if you cannot take us into a hou&s;e, you mu&s;t maintain us out of one. When this plea is cut off, numbers of them find the means of maintaining them&s;elves; &s;everal indeed, under the character of <HI>out-doors-poor,</HI> every pari&s;h <HI>mu&s;t</HI> maintain; but the offer of a good hou&s;e draws a line between tho&s;e who ought, and tho&s;e who ought not to have this in|dulgence. In the old hou&s;e the expence of the <HI>out-doors-poor</HI> was about 8 or 9 pounds monthly. It is at this time only 1<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 12<ABBR>s.</ABBR></P>
<P>Another article of &s;aving is in the health of the poor. In the other hou&s;e there were often con|tagious fevers, and other di&s;orders, from the clo&s;e|ne&s;s and na&s;tine&s;s of the place, and its inhabitants; and though a pari&s;h doctor was regularly paid, yet the expence for wine and other cordials, whe|ther nece&s;&s;ary, or unnece&s;&s;ary, was often con&s;i|derable; whereas the airine&s;s and cleanline&s;s of the pre&s;ent hou&s;e&mdash;the good clothing&mdash;the whole|&s;omene&s;s, and plenty of provi&s;ions, together with the care taken in keeping the family clean, have, under God, &s;uch an effect upon their health, that
<PB N="10" REF="032194_0009_0FF17DC300011940">no epidemical di&s;order, or indeed di&s;order of any kind, has appeared among them. The face of the pari&s;h-doctor is hardly known.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e articles of &s;aving may be added, the care and integrity of the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s. Every thing makes the be&s;t end; the very crumbs from cutting the bread for each meal are put into the milk or broth, or whatever is next prepared; and this is the more prai&s;e-worthy, as neither the bread nor meat is in any &s;hape farmed to the ma&s;|ter; &s;o that what he does, is done entirely from an hone&s;t principle of &s;erving the pari&s;h. It would not indeed be difficult for him, if he were &s;o di&s;|po&s;ed, to turn much to his own advantage; e&s;pe|cially as he keeps the accounts of the pari&s;h; for which he is well qualified, both by his &s;kill and his integrity.</P>
<P>By all the&s;e modes of care, economy, and in|tegrity, together with the profits of the hou&s;e-la|bour, a &s;aving in the poor rates of the pari&s;h was made, this year, of 157<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 1<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> notwith&s;tanding the advanced price of provi&s;ions, and a variety of expences, nece&s;&s;ary in a new e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>Without doors</HI> things are managed with the &s;ame care and order. Both the gardens belonging to
<PB N="11" REF="032194_0010_0FF17DC5D73D66E0">the hou&s;e are in the highe&s;t degree of cultivation, and bear &s;uch quantities of potatoes and cabbage, the chief vegetables u&s;ed in the family, that the ma&s;ter finds he is not only &s;ufficiently &s;upplied, but has enough to feed his hogs, and often to give away to his poor neighbours. A theft, one night, was committed in the gardens, and at lea&s;t two hundred weight of cabbages carried off. When &s;omebody was bemoaning the lo&s;s to the ma&s;ter, "It was a pitiful thing, he ob&s;erved, to &s;teal from a pari&s;h work-hou&s;e; but in the light of an incon|venience to him, it would have been none, if they had carried off twice as much." His ground is &s;o well dunged, and &s;o productive, that among a number of large cabbages, he had the curio&s;ity to weigh one that &s;eemed larger than the re&s;t, and found its weight to be twenty-&s;even pounds, after the out&s;ide leaves had been &s;tripped off. During the &s;carcity of the year 1795, he was obliged in|deed to purcha&s;e potatoes.</P>
<P>But the economy of this excellent in&s;titution is not more plea&s;ing than the cheerfulne&s;s and happy air, with which every thing is conducted. The old women, when they behave well, have little indulgences of tea and &s;nuff, which they value much; the men, of tobacco; and the children's
<PB N="12" REF="032194_0011_0FF17DCC954121B0">ta&s;ks are made plea&s;ing, by giving them little gra|tuities out of their earnings. The ma&s;ter has the art of turning even their play-hours to u&s;e; and yet making them more happy, than if they were left to them&s;elves. If he want the &s;tones, for in|&s;tance, picked out of the garden, with a &s;mall gra|tuity to tho&s;e who pick the mo&s;t, he &s;ets &s;uch a number of little hands at work, that the bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;oon accompli&s;hed; or, if he want dung brought into the garden, he yokes half a dozen of them to a wheel-barrow, and makes one of them the waggoner, with a long whip, but without the power of exerci&s;ing it. This employment is very plea&s;ing; it is good exerci&s;e and pre&s;ently di&s;|patches the bu&s;ine&s;s. If the ma&s;ter happen to <HI>have</HI> no employment for them, during their play-hours, he often <HI>makes</HI> it. He will &s;end, for in&s;tance, three or four of them, if the afternoon be fine, to &s;ome di&s;tant part of the pari&s;h, with a letter of no con&s;equence, but to amu&s;e them with a walk, and teach them to be tru&s;ty in a charge; or, in nutting-&s;ea&s;on, he will &s;end three or four of &s;uch as he can be&s;t depend on, to gather nuts in the fore&s;t; but with condition, that whatever quantity they gather, &s;hall be divided with tho&s;e who &s;tay at home. This year (1795) was &s;o abundant in nuts, and &s;uch quantities were gathered, that Mrs. Salter
<PB N="13" REF="032194_0012_0FF17DCF705D87E0">thought it prudent to take the management of &s;o large a &s;tore under her care, and di&s;tribute it in doles.</P>
<P>But none of the&s;e amu&s;ements are allowed till their ta&s;ks are performed. Sometimes in a fine morning the ma&s;ter &s;ignifies his intention of thus employing three or four of them: on which the wheels run with prodigious rapidity, and all bu&s;i|ne&s;s is over by two in the afternoon. He &s;uffers them al&s;o in &s;ummer to ri&s;e very early in the morn|ing, before the family is up, and go down quietly to their work, which they are very eager to do. Such work appears like voluntary labour. The condition on the&s;e occa&s;ions is, not to &s;peak a word till the clock &s;trikes &s;ix, which is the ap|pointed hour. And this condition the ma&s;ter &s;ays, he believes is punctually complied with; he often hears the whirling of the wheels, but no other &s;ound. The&s;e little re&s;traints are very u&s;e|ful in habituating children to order and decency.</P>
<P>To <HI>exemplify</HI> the happine&s;s, which the indivi|duals of this well-regulated hou&s;e enjoy, I might produce &s;everal in&s;tances; I &s;hall &s;pecify a few.</P>
<P>Two old women, reduced to the lowe&s;t degree of penury, and really &s;tarving, if their neighbours
<PB N="14" REF="032194_0013_0FF17DD10B94B8C0">had not a&s;&s;i&s;ted them, re&s;olutely held out, and de|clared that they would rather die under a hedge, than go into the poor-hou&s;e. If &s;uch a declara|tion had been made in the time of the old poor-hou&s;e, they might &s;till have been objects of pity; but at this time it rather cooled the charity of their friends, who indeed thought, that maintaining them out of the hou&s;e was encouraging a di&s;con|tented &s;pirit again&s;t an in&s;titution &s;o well conduct|ed, and in every light &s;o advantageous to the poor. This had its effect; as winter came on, and fuel grew &s;carce, their pride, which had a great &s;hare in their re&s;i&s;tance, gave way; and they were driven to &s;eek the comforts of a warm kitchen fire at the hou&s;e. A very &s;hort time convinced them of their folly, and they &s;oon declared, they had never lived &s;o comfortably before.</P>
<P>There was an elderly man in the pari&s;h, of the name of Brown; he had been bred a thatcher, but was able to work at any kind of labour; he was &s;en&s;ible, hone&s;t, and good-natured in a great degree; and being a &s;tout, robu&s;t fellow, he might have made a very good livelihood; but he was &s;o totally carele&s;s of what he earned, &s;o thoughtle&s;s and imprudent in every re&s;pect, that he went about in rags, and never knew where to get a
<PB N="15" REF="032194_0014_0FF17DD3E35C4AB8">dinner at noon, or a bed at night; indeed he had reduced him&s;elf at length to &s;uch a degree of weak|ne&s;s and wretchedne&s;s, that he could hardly crawl about. In this nece&s;&s;ity, hunger at length drove him into the hou&s;e. Here plenty of good provi&s;ion &s;oon recruited him, and he became a u&s;eful member. To work of no kind he has objection; he digs the garden; he carries out work; he brings meat from the market; often Mr. Salter lets him out to work, on account of the pari&s;h; in thatching ricks and cottages he is particularly u&s;eful. The money he earns, he always brings hone&s;tly home, out of which he receives, for his own u&s;e, a penny in the &s;hilling. In the mean time he is perfectly happy; he is well cloathed, well fed, and well lodged; and as to money, as he never knew the advantages of it, the want of it is no di&s;tre&s;s; the few halfpence he receives, he never keeps in his pocket longer than till he has an oppor|tunity of di&s;tributing them among the children, and old women of the hou&s;e; among whom he is &s;o great a favourite, that the latter &s;hew their gratitude to him by tricking him out on Sundays with all the neatne&s;s they are able. He, who u&s;ed to go about the pari&s;h in rags, not worth picking off a dunghill, now goes to church in a good &s;uit of clothes; his brea&s;t is unbuttoned, and di&s;plays
<PB N="16" REF="032194_0015_0FF17DD922C317F8">a deep ruffle hanging out, neatly plaited; his cra|vat is well wa&s;hed; and a black ribband is tied round his neck. His ambition and con&s;equence were one day rai&s;ed, when a &s;tranger coming out of the church, and looking with plea&s;ure on the orderly proce&s;&s;ion of the work-hou&s;e family, point|ed to Brown, and a&s;ked, if he was not the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e? it &s;hould be remembered however, that with all his profu&s;ene&s;s, he was mindful, with the fir&s;t money he received, to pay his debts: the&s;e amounted to four pence, which in &s;ome pre&s;&s;ure of his affairs he had formerly borrowed, and now remembered. This &s;ingular character, though he is &s;o indu&s;trious, that Mr. Salter thinks he main|tains at lea&s;t four people by his labour, is yet &s;o attached to the hou&s;e, that nothing could prevail with him to leave it. His neighbours often tell him, what a fool he is thus to work for other peo|ple, when he might earn his own money; but Brown is philo&s;opher enough to know him&s;elf; and hath had &s;ufficient experience of the extent of his own prudence, not to tru&s;t him&s;elf under its direction again, while he can live under the care of &s;o kind a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>But the great merit of the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of this well e&s;tabli&s;hed hou&s;e, con&s;i&s;ts in in&s;tructing
<PB N="17" REF="032194_0016_0FF17DDBF0342DF0">the ignorant, and reforming the abandoned. Every morning, when the bell rings for breakfa&s;t, the family all a&s;&s;emble in the kitchen. Each knows his place; &s;o there is no confu&s;ion, and a &s;trict &s;ilence is enjoined: &s;oon after the ma&s;ter comes in, and reads, and generally explains (which he is very able to do) &s;ome ea&s;y and practical part of the New-Te&s;tament; after this they all join in prayer. On Sunday morning, and evening, the&s;e exerci&s;es are enlarged, and accompanied often with &s;inging hymns, in which the children join. They &s;ometimes &s;ing hymns al&s;o at their work, when twenty or thirty &s;pinning wheels are all going to|gether. The ma&s;ter &s;ays, he would oftener intro|duce &s;inging hymns at their work; but he judi|ciou&s;ly ob&s;erves, that the &s;lowne&s;s of the mea&s;ure is too apt to introduce &s;lowne&s;s in their hands. One tune however has particular credit with him, the movements of which are well adapted to the motion of the wheel; and for that rea&s;on it goes among them by the name of the <HI>&s;pinning-wheel tune;</HI> all other &s;inging the ma&s;ter forbids; which appeared rather hard: his rea&s;on for it however is good; he has no objection to innocent &s;ongs; but as he found he could not draw a line between them, and &s;uch as were corrupting, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to forbid all together. The
<PB N="18" REF="032194_0017_0FF17DDD88A180D0">penalty is the forfeiture of the little earnings of the day from their labour. They regularly at|tend church on Sundays; and it is a plea&s;ing &s;ight to &s;ee &s;o many well clothed figures, happy faces, and healthy countenances, i&s;&s;uing from a pari&s;h-work-hou&s;e. In the afternoon, on Sunday, the children attend the &s;chool, where they are cate|chi&s;ed with the other children of the neighbour|hood: the old people al&s;o attend with them.</P>
<P>The good order of the hou&s;e is pre&s;erved rather by rewards than puni&s;hments. When this family was fir&s;t received from the old hou&s;e, the ma&s;ter had occa&s;ion for all his prudence to manage, and bring them into order. Their habits of idlene&s;s, and wickedne&s;s were &s;o &s;trong, and their ideas of order and di&s;cipline, &s;o weak, that he had great difficulty in pre&s;erving the true medium between too lax, and too &s;trict a government. If he had cor|rected every thing he &s;aw ami&s;s, he mu&s;t have been continually correcting, and might have irritated, and hardened. His great art, therefore, was to find excu&s;es for pa&s;&s;ing over many faults; and yet to make the children believe he would pa&s;s over none. When he had informed a boy, for in&s;tance, that he meant to puni&s;h him in the evening; his wife, as if ignorant of the matter, would &s;end him to bed with the re&s;t. In the morning he would call up
<PB N="19" REF="032194_0018_0FF17DDF3035B490">the boy, and let him know, how angry he was with him, and how &s;everely he would have puni&s;h|ed him, if his mi&s;tre&s;s had not &s;ent him to bed. However, as the matter was now over, he would pa&s;s it by this time. Sometimes, however, to &s;hew he was in earne&s;t, he would puni&s;h an extraordi|nary offence with &s;everity; at the &s;ame time he endeavoured to &s;hew that he was much readier to reward, than puni&s;h, when any thing was done which he approved. Thus by keeping a &s;teady hand, and not ha&s;tening the work of reformation too quickly, he brought them by degrees into good order. And when he had once gotten his fir&s;t &s;et orderly, it was ea&s;y to keep up an orderly family. Such as came in afterwards, though ob|&s;tinate and refractory, could not fight again&s;t &s;o di&s;ciplined an e&s;tabli&s;hment. Like head&s;trong bul|locks yoked in an orderly team, they could not well be mi&s;chievous. As his plan is to rule ra|ther by affection, than fear, in which he has been very &s;ucce&s;sful, his puni&s;hments, when he has now brought his e&s;tabli&s;hment to this orderly &s;tate, are very few, and gentle. They con&s;i&s;t chiefly in lock|ing up delinquents in a room by them&s;elves, or abridging them of a meal. But the&s;e happen rare|ly. When he thinks him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of puni&s;hing a boy corporally, knowing the ill-fame
<PB N="20" REF="032194_0019_0FF12D79C2AE7660">which ma&s;ters of work-hou&s;es commonly lye under, he choo&s;es to have &s;ome re&s;pectable per|&s;on pre&s;ent. But he is never driven to this ex|tremity, but in ca&s;es of theft, or other atrocious wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>In this orderly hou&s;e, where all bad examples are removed, and &s;cenes only of piety, indu&s;try, and regularity are before the eye, &s;everal refractory, and &s;ome abandoned people, have been reclaimed. Among the children, it is hoped, the&s;e in&s;tructive le&s;&s;ons, will have the be&s;t effect. But among the old people, &s;ome, who had led loo&s;e, di&s;orderly lives, (as a fore&s;t is not the be&s;t nur&s;ery of virtue) have acknowledged them&s;elves much happier in a &s;tate of decency, regularity, and virtue; and have accordingly changed their manners, and become orderly people; of this two or three in&s;tances might be given.</P>
<P>One of the greate&s;t in&s;tances of the happy in|fluence of this hou&s;e, in reclaiming ob&s;tinate wick|edne&s;s, was &s;hewn in a woman of the name of Young. Her father, a reprobate fellow, had been thrown into Winche&s;ter jail for deer-&s;teeling; and as he could not pay his fine, which was thirty pounds, he was tempted to obtain his liberty, by accepting the po&s;t of county-hangman, which he
<PB N="21" REF="032194_0020_0FF17DE746EC8988">held till his death. Her mother was a noi&s;y, bawl|ing woman, who, neglecting her family, u&s;ed to be&s;et all pa&s;&s;engers at the bridge, and clamour loud of the hardne&s;s of the times, and the nece&s;&s;ities of her family; two or three of whom &s;he u&s;ed gene|rally to produce in rags, to confirm her di&s;tre&s;s. The children of &s;uch parents could hardly be &s;up|po&s;ed to turn out well. The girl, of whom we now &s;peak, had been put to &s;chool, with a view to teach her &s;ome good, and keep her out of more harm. But it had little effect: as &s;oon as &s;he could u&s;e her hands dexterou&s;ly, &s;he began to pil|fer; and with &s;uch ingenuity, that it is probable &s;he had learned &s;ome le&s;&s;ons from her father's conver&s;ation, who had always lodgings among his old friends in the jail, during his periodical excur|&s;ions to Winche&s;ter. To do him ju&s;tice, however, he &s;hewed a laudable fear, le&s;t his daughter &s;hould come judicially under his hands; and has been known to tie her up, and correct her very &s;everely. His &s;everity, however, only turned her from one kind of wickedne&s;s to another. She next intro|duced her&s;elf to a regiment of &s;oldiers, who were marching through the country, with whom &s;he lived, till di&s;ea&s;e &s;ent her back to her pari&s;h. She had now no home, her father and mother being dead. She was &s;ent therefore to the old poor-hou&s;e,
<PB N="22" REF="032194_0021_0FF17DEA1B53AE88">which hath been de&s;cribed as a place not much calculated to produce reformation. When &s;he was cured of her di&s;order, &s;he went off again; leading the &s;ame profligate life &s;he had led be|fore; and this was repeated two or three times. In this &s;tate &s;he was brought to the new hou&s;e, which, at fir&s;t, was a &s;tate of unea&s;y confinement to her. But by degrees, the comfortable life &s;he now led&mdash;the recollection of what &s;he had &s;uffered&mdash;and the &s;cenes &s;he had gone through, though &s;he was yet only a young woman, gave her mind a new turn, and &s;he became a thorough penitent. Her credit indeed is now &s;o great, that the ma&s;ter has made her one of his &s;uperintendants over the children at work.</P>
<P>Thus a happy and u&s;eful &s;ociety, for &s;uch it may be called, is formed out of the dregs of the pari&s;h. The old people, having all their wants well &s;up|plied, feel them&s;elves happier than they ever did before; and are glad to render cheerfully, in re|turn, what little &s;ervices they can. And the child|ren, bred to indu&s;try and virtue, &s;tand a good chance of being formed, from little profligates, into u&s;eful members of &s;ociety.</P>

The pari&s;h of Boldre will long remember the humanity and integrity, the judicious management, and the religious care of the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, by who&s;e means, chiefly, this excellent e&s;tabli&s;h|ment has been &s;o happily completed.</P>
