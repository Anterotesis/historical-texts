<HEAD>MR. HOOBY's ADVICE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearly beloved in Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE the&s;e lines reach you, the hand that writes them, will be mouldering in the du&s;t. Receive them, not as from mine hou&s;e upon earth;&mdash; but within it, dated from the grave, that hou&s;e appointed for you, and all the living, dead Abel yet &s;peaketh,&mdash;he only &s;peaketh, that he may bring you to that precious Blood which &s;peaketh better things than the blood of Abel, crying aloud for pardon, peace, reconciliation and &s;alvation. God is my wit|ne&s;s, you were my pa&s;t concern; God grant you may be my future joy. That concern, and the hope of this joy, is the cau&s;e of the&s;e lines, which as they find you now looking towards a re&s;ettlement, &s;o are de&s;igned thro' divine grace, to a&s;&s;i&s;t you therein.</P>
<P>REALIZE, my dearly beloved, that it is a great work you are entering upon and a great ble&s;&s;ing that you &s;tand in need of. Look upon your families look upon your dear children, that you mu&s;t quickly leave behind you, and, with the mo&s;t importunate concern, realize how greatly their &s;afety, welfare, comfort and happine&s;s, for time and for eternity may turn upon your receiving &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing. Realize again, the op|po&s;ition you are likely to meet with in your way to it. My death, I doubt not, gives &s;atan more life. The &s;cythe that cuts down God's mini&s;ters, makes way for the enemy to &s;ow tares, and furni&s;hes him
<PB N="3" REF="041550_0003_101AB51B27263B68" MS="y">with the pro&s;pect of a large harve&s;t. Oh! be &s;trongly on your guard again&s;t a mind prepared to receive them. And therefore put away all pride, anger, envy, headine&s;s, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and the like, &s;uch-like tempers are his hope, and your amazing danger. Yet however greatly concerned, be not di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. God liveth God loveth, and Chri&s;t intercedeth. A proper con|cern for your&s;elves is a proof of the divine concern for you; and while the blood of Chri&s;t is precious to you, fear not that he will leave you de&s;titute of a faithful pa&s;tor, the purcha&s;e of that blood&mdash;That you may obtain which, let me &s;olemnly charge you to begin with prayer and fa&s;ting, and humiliation. God lays his beams in the waters; &s;o mu&s;t you too, in the deep waters of repentance, if you would have him dwell with you, in that hou&s;e of his which is the church. From him cometh every good gift, and e&s;|pecially that great good, a pa&s;tor after his own heart. But he will be &s;ought to, for it. Oh go to him, and be glad that you may do &s;o. Pour out your tears, and your &s;ouls into his bo&s;om. Confe&s;s your &s;ins before him, particularly whatever has been ami&s;s in your conduct towards your former pa&s;tors. And e&s;pecially your carele&s;ne&s;s to profit by their mini&s;trati|ons. Acknowledge God's ju&s;tice in taking them away, and your own unworthine&s;s of another. Yet plead with him, his goodne&s;s, mercy, his promi&s;e and that how great &s;oever is your unworthine&s;s, the more divinely bright will his grace appear in overcoming it. You mu&s;t &s;ee your own unworthine&s;s, of &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing, if you may expect to receive it; and your acknowledg|ing that unworthine&s;s is the way to the ble&s;&s;ing. Not only pray, but continue in prayers; feel your own want, and wre&s;tle with God for the &s;upply of it.
<PB N="4" REF="041550_0004_101AB51CA8E6B400">Wre&s;tle till you prevail. If you will take no denial, God will give you no refu&s;al. There is a kind of omnipotency in prayers yea, may I not &s;ay it overcomes omnipotence it&s;elf, di&s;arms God of his anger and extorts that language from him, Commad ye me.</P>
<P>AND now having &s;ought to God.&mdash;In the next place take council of men; e&s;pecially of the Min&s;ters of Chri&s;t round about you: many of whom, ble&s;&s;ed be God, are of amiable capacity, gracious integrity, and who will naturally care for your &s;tate. But beware of poor low&s;pirited, &s;elfi&s;h and fal&s;e advi&s;ers. Be well advi&s;ed in your&s;elves, in order to your receiving the be&s;t advice of others.&mdash;And now &s;uppo&s;ing you to have made application to &s;ome gentleman with a veiw to &s;ettle.&mdash; Be ye watchful.&mdash;Be watchful over your&s;elves, again&s;t all prejudice, one way or another. E&s;pecially be watchful over your affections; the&s;e often blind the under&s;tanding, and blind the judgment. Don't judge of a mini&s;ter as you do of a bell, by the mere &s;ound, nor by mere outward appearances; &s;uch as air, manner, addre&s;s, delivery and the like. The&s;e, however plea&s;|ing, are but the mere work of nature, or the bu&s;ine&s;s of art. It is not all gold that gli&s;tens. Take heed how ye hear&mdash;In the next place be watchful of him. Watch narrowly his preaching. Take heed what you hear. Examine whether his preaching be clo&s;e, pun|gent, and particular; or only large, vague and general; whether by bringing in bad principles, he do not cor|rupt the truth of Chri&s;t and endanger your &s;ouls; or whether he do not cunningly conceal his principles for the pre&s;ent, that &s;o he and his bad principles may creep in unawares together. Do you hear any thing of the imputation of Adam's &s;in, and of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, the depravity of man's nature, and the
<PB N="5" REF="041550_0005_101AB51E5BD82898" MS="y">nece&s;&s;ity of efficacious grace; doth he preach Chri&s;t, as the all in all of man, his wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and redemption; if, not, &s;hun him as you would a po&s;t.&mdash;Again be watchful over his con|duct whether it di&s;covers &s;incerity and hone&s;ty, wi&s;dom and prudence, the rea&s;on of a man, the judgment of a &s;cholar, the grace of a chri&s;tian, and the exempla|rine&s;s of a mini&s;ter.&mdash;Again, be watchful to know his principles as a divine: here let me charge you, as you will an&s;wer it at the great day, that you don't &s;ettle in the dark, and never was greater need of &s;uch a charge, than at this day; becau&s;e never greater dan|ger of the go&s;pel of God's grace; it being perverted into a go&s;pel without any grace at all. You have a right to know his principles. And if you neglect this right, I fear God is blinding in order to de&s;tory you. Remember how and what you have received and heard, and hold fa&s;t. Religion, I am confident, will be likely to live, as tho&s;e doctrines, which, for di&s;tinction &s;ake, are called calvini&s;tic, live, or &s;o die, as they die. And if upon examination of the matter you find that the man's principles are not &s;ettled, I be&s;eech you &s;ettle not yet the man.&mdash;Once more, be watchful not only that the principles of the man be good, but that he be al&s;o a good man him&s;elf; that he have a good heart, as well as a good head.&mdash;Endeavour that the man of your choice be al&s;o one whom the Lord hath cho&s;en to him&s;elf. God may indeed make u&s;e of a bad man to bring about good de&s;igns; but it is not likely that one who is but a ve&s;&s;el in which he has no plea|&s;ure &s;hould be u&s;ed as a ve&s;&s;el of honour to bear God's name and grace unto his people: no; &s;uch an one is a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el; them that honour God, will God honour. However, much caution and mode&s;ty is to
<PB N="6" REF="041550_0006_101AB51FEBD9BD10">be u&s;ed in this matter, and much chri&s;tian charity; for tho' it would be egregious folly in you to commit the care of your &s;ouls to one that manife&s;ted no care of his own; yet there may be much cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s in determining that he has no &s;uch care, or doth not manife&s;t it: and where there is this cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, there is always pride; and where pride is, there is a demon&s;tration that you have not taken &s;ufficient care of your own &s;ouls. Here therefore let your zeal be accompanied with the meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom. Pru|dence is profitable to direct. Furthermore, in order to abtain this de&s;ired ble&s;&s;ing, not only watch and pray, con&s;ult and advi&s;e, but al&s;o wait too. Such a mine is not ea&s;ily dug. Such a ble&s;&s;ing is not pre|&s;ently obtained. Guard therefore again&s;t all precipi|tancy. Take time and you will not only do it the better, but do it the &s;ooner. A few months may de|ceive you into anxiety, when a longer time may open your eyes to your full quiet and &s;atisfaction. The apo&s;tle requires that a deacon be fir&s;t proved or tried. Of how much more grand importance is it that a go&s;pel bi&s;hop &s;hould be &s;o. How immen&s;e the riches committed to their tru&s;t. I humbly tru&s;t that the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t will be careful that they do not lay hands &s;uddenly upon any man. And I &s;olemnly charge you as from the world of eternity, that you do not lift up your hands &s;uddenly for any man.</P>
<P>AND now my beloved people, to ha&s;ten to a long farewell. Having given you that advice, which my love and concern for you have in&s;pired, and which I am per&s;uaded the Spirit of God approves; and in the humble hope that you will obtain the ble&s;&s;ing I &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ire for you; let me reque&s;t and demand in the name of Chri&s;t my dear Ma&s;ter, that you think
<PB N="7" REF="041550_0007_101AB522F8122BF8">nothing too much to do for &s;uch a pa&s;tor; and did you know the heart of a mini&s;ter, you would think &s;o indeed, and by every method, endeavour to &s;ooth and ea&s;e it. Before you receive the&s;e lines, I &s;hall be free from the danger of a &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit my&s;elf, and the &s;u&s;picion of it in you. 'Tis your intere&s;t I am &s;eeking, and if you are dear to your pa&s;tor, as you will be if you choo&s;e &s;uch an one as I have pointed out, Oh! let him be dear to you; if he preaches to you the true go&s;pel, he de&s;erves to live of the go&s;pel. Though he can merit nothing of his ma&s;ter, yet he in his name merits much of you. If he &s;ows to you in &s;pirtiual thing, don't think it much if he reap of you carnal things&mdash;A rich mini&s;ter, I readily grant, has always been the bane of religion; but let me a&s;&s;ure you, that an impoveri&s;hed mini&s;try always will be &s;o. Beware of Jeroboam's prie&s;ts, le&s;t di&s;contented with their condition, they become Jeroboams them|&s;elves. Let your mini&s;ter have enough to keep him cho&s;e in his &s;tudy, that he may &s;erve God and you without di&s;traction; to give honourably to him is to do honour to God and get good to your&s;elves,&mdash; And now having vented the love of a friend, and the heart of a pa&s;tor, hearken to my la&s;t words, which &s;peak to you in this wi&s;e.</P>
<P>DEARLY <HI>Beloved,</HI> See that you fall not out by the way. Be of one mind as far as po&s;&s;ible: if not, be of one heart. Put on as the elect of God, bowels of mercies, kindne&s;s, humblene&s;s of mind, meekne&s;s, long-&s;uffering, forbearing one another, forgiving one another; if any man have a quarrel again&s;t any, even as Chri&s;t forgave you, &s;o al&s;o do ye; and above all the&s;e things, put on charity, which is the bond of perfectne&s;s, and let the peace of God rule in your
<PB N="8" REF="041550_0008_101AB52539B05F20">hearts. To who&s;e ble&s;&s;ing I earne&s;tly commend you in Chir&s;t Je&s;us, praying that all you, and I, may meet as his right hand, and &s;pend an eternity in prai&s;ing him, and God his father for him,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>This is the la&s;t farewell of your Once affectionate pa&s;tor,</HI> W. HOOBY, <HI>Now no more</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
