<P>IN page 255 a fact is &s;tated which contradicts the &s;tatement re&s;pect|ing the planet Mars in page 241. There is an error in one of the &s;tatements; and I leave a&s;tronomers to determin by calculations which of the authorities, Ames' Almanac for 1750, or the Annual Regi&s;ter, is wrong. The error is not material to my &s;ubject. The only que&s;tion of con&s;equence, is, whether the near approach of Mars had any influ|ence, in producing the extreme heat of 1749 and 1766&mdash;a que&s;tion I pretend not to determin.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<PB REF="036687_0005_100A89B1FA85D790">
<P>A PUBLICATION on the &s;ubject of di&s;ea&s;es, from the pen of a man who has never before turn|ed his attention to medical &s;cience or to chymi&s;try, is a circum&s;tance, which, if it does not require an apology, demands at lea&s;t an explanation.</P>
<P>The prevalence of the catarrh, commonly called influenza, in the years 1789 and 90, fir&s;t awakened my curio&s;ity on the &s;ubject of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es. A journey which I made in October 1789, from Hartford to Bo&s;ton; and another in March 1790 from Hartford to Albany; led me to ob&s;erve the <HI>progre&s;&s;ivene&s;s</HI> of that di&s;ea&s;e, with its other phe|nomena.</P>
<P>The appearance of the &s;carlatina angino&s;a in 1793 revived my curio&s;ity, and a &s;imilar circum|&s;tance, a journey from Hartford to New-York in April of that year, led me to ob&s;erve a progre&s;&s;ion in that di&s;ea&s;e from We&s;t to Ea&s;t. A &s;light attack which my own children &s;uffered, in May following, together with a &s;imilar attack of many other chil|dren in Hartford, and its more violent effects &s;ome months after, convinced me that the epidemic was <HI>progre&s;&s;ive</HI> in <HI>malignancy,</HI> as well as in regard to <HI>place.</HI></P>
<P>Had no other epidemic appeared, my curio&s;ity would probably have &s;ub&s;ided and been extin|gui&s;hed. The malignant fever in New-York in 1791, had excited alarm in that city, and was a
<PB N="vi" REF="036687_0006_100A89B575C36998">
&s;ubject of notice in Hartford where I then re&s;ided; but no idea had been conceived, that it was con|nected with a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of the air, in the United States, which was afterwards to produce more &s;erious and general calamities.</P>
<P>In autumn 1793 however that pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air arrived to its cri&s;is in Philadelphia, where the mortality occa&s;ioned by the yellow fever, &s;pread de&s;truction and di&s;may, from Augu&s;t to Novem|ber. The fatality of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread con&s;terna|tion thro the United States, and excited apprehen|&s;ions in Europe.</P>
<P>No American citizen could be indifferent to the prevalence of this di&s;ea&s;e in his own country. Still it was conceived that the di&s;temper might have been produced from imported infection, and that a more rigid execution of the laws relating to quarantine, might prevent a repetition of the calamity. Here re&s;ted apprehen&s;ion and enquiry.</P>
<P>But this tranquillity was of &s;hort duration. The appearance of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e in New-Haven in 1794, and in New-York, Baltimore and Norfolk in 1795, revived my curio&s;ity, with double zeal to &s;earch out the cau&s;es of the&s;e phenomena, &s;o unu&s;ual in this country. The facts which had come to my knowledge, relating to the origin and prop|agation of this di&s;ea&s;e, led me to &s;u&s;pect the com|mon theory of <HI>infection</HI> to be ill-founded. But as a preliminary to all other enquiries, it appeared nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ettle the controver&s;y relative to the <HI>imported</HI> or <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> &s;ources of the di&s;temper; for without, a deci&s;ion of this que&s;tion, legi&s;lative and police-regulations, for preventing a return of the
<PB N="vii" REF="036687_0007_100A89B701BA2768">
evil, or mitigating its &s;everity, would probably be fruitle&s;s. The que&s;tion appeared to be extremely important, and the differences of opinion on the &s;ubject, among medical gentlemen, &s;eemed to pre|clude the po&s;&s;ibility of a deci&s;ion among them, that &s;hould &s;ilence doubts in the public mind.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of the controver&s;y, I re&s;olved to make an effort to obtain evidence which might de|cide the point, in one way or the other; and as facts only can be relied on as a &s;ure ba&s;is of prin|ciples and theory, I determined to make a collect|ion of facts, from all parts of the United States, where the yellow fever, or other malignant fevers had prevailed, during the preceding years. For this purpo&s;e, on the 31&s;t of October 1795, I ad|dre&s;&s;ed a circular letter to the phy&s;icians of Phila|delphia, New-York, Baltimore, Norfolk, New-Ha|ven, and in general, throughout the United States, reque&s;ting them to communicate to me whatever facts had come within their ob&s;ervation, which could throw light on the que&s;tion of the foreign or dome&s;tic origin of the yellow fever. In con&s;e|quence of which I received a number of commu|nications, which were publi&s;hed in 1796, and to which is prefixed my circular letter.</P>
<P>The&s;e communications, tho le&s;s numerous and &s;atisfactory than were de&s;irable, united with a mul|titude of facts within my own ob&s;ervation, <HI>convin|ced</HI> me of the fallacy of the vulgar opinion, re|&s;pecting the origin of the yellow fever in the Uni|ted States, from imported &s;ources. I found re|peatedly that the reports of per&s;ons taken ill, in con&s;equence of intercour&s;e with ve&s;&s;els from the
<PB N="viii" REF="036687_0008_100A89B8888E3B38">
We&s;t-Indies, or with di&s;ea&s;ed &s;eamen, infected cot|ton or clothing, or the like cau&s;es, were mere idle tales, rai&s;ed by the ignorant or intere&s;ted, and wholly un&s;upported by evidence. Scarcely an in|&s;tance could be found, in which the evidence of the propagation of di&s;ea&s;e, from imported infection, was &s;ufficient to render the fact even probable.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the evidence of the origina|tion of the di&s;ea&s;e in New-York, Baltimore, Nor|folk, Newburyport, Bo&s;ton and Charle&s;ton, appear|ed to be clear and &s;atisfactory. In mo&s;t of tho&s;e places, the fact has never been que&s;tioned.</P>
<P>When the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e appeared in Philadelphia in 1797; the que&s;tion of importation or dome&s;tic origin, again agitated the faculty and the public. The revival of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and particularly, cer|tain publications of Dr. William Currie, in the Philadelphia prints, called forth my exertions to unite opinions and &s;ave the citizens of this country from the di&s;traction of mea&s;ures, which mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily follow a divi&s;ion of opinions. I con&s;idered and &s;till con&s;ider the que&s;tion as re&s;ting principally on fact, and not on medical &s;kill; therefore proper to be inve&s;tigated and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by any man who has lei&s;ure and means, as well as by phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations gave ri&s;e to the ob&s;ervations which I addre&s;&s;ed to Dr. Currie, thro the medium of the public papers, in the months of October, November and December 1797. The de&s;ign of the&s;e ob&s;ervations was originally limited to the pur|po&s;e of proving the yellow fever of our country to be generated by local and dome&s;tic cau&s;es, by lay|ing together the facts which I had collected from
<PB N="ix" REF="036687_0009_100A89BAD43D0F90">
various parts of the United States, without any in|tention of examining the hi&s;tory and phenomena of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es in other countries, and other periods of the world.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uing this object however, I was led in&s;en|&s;ibly to examin all the books I could find, on the &s;ubject of the plague; and the &s;ubject being new, I found too much plea&s;ure in pro&s;ecuting it, readily to abandon the pur&s;uit. Facts which were new to me were daily pre&s;enting them&s;elves to my mind; and after three months inve&s;tigation, I was per&s;ua|ded that tho&s;e facts are of too much importance to philo&s;ophy, to medicin and to human happine&s;s, not to merit publication. Such is the origin of the pre&s;ent treati&s;e.</P>
<P>When I began my enquiries into the origin of the yellow fever, in 1795, I had no preconceived &s;y&s;tem to maintain. My view was to collect facts and from them to deduce TRUTH. It is not my intention to advance theory over fact; but as far as ju&s;t philo&s;ophy and &s;ound logic will permit, draw theory from facts, and if po&s;&s;ible, by fair rea&s;oning, from the uniform operations of nature, to arrive at fixed principles. If conjectures &s;hould in any in&s;tance be advanced, they will be offered as &s;uch, and not as the ba&s;is of practice.</P>
<P>As there is a difference of opinion in regard to the cau&s;es of the plague, and other pe&s;tilential di&s;|ea&s;es, as well as in regard to the identity of the yellow fever and plague, I &s;hall define my manner of u&s;ing certain terms, which will often occur in the following work.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="036687_0010_100A8A9181200E30">That pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e which u&s;ually, in the Levant, produces &s;wellings in the glands, as buboes, I &s;hall call the <HI>glandular</HI> or <HI>inguinal</HI> plague.</P>
<P>The pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e which has afflicted &s;ome of the cities in America, and is u&s;ually called yellow fever, I &s;hall denominate, the <HI>bilious</HI> or <HI>American plague.</HI></P>
<P>In the Levant plague, &s;wellings in the groin, in the arm-pits, and behind the ears, do not, in every ca&s;e, appear; but they are the general di&s;tingui&s;h|ing marks of the true pe&s;tis or plague.</P>
<P>In the yellow fever, the &s;kin is not, in every ca&s;e, marked by a yellow color; but it is generally the fact, and therefore this form of pe&s;tilence may very well take its denomination from that circum|&s;tance of its bilious appearance.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e are di&s;ea&s;e &s;pecifically di&s;tinct, or only the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e varied and modified by cli|mate, &s;ea&s;on or other circum&s;tances. is a que&s;tion that belongs to the faculty. It is &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, that in mo&s;t of the &s;ymptoms, they agree&mdash;that they are pe&s;tilential and greatly to be dreaded by mankind. I &s;hall therefore treat them as different forms of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e. There may be &s;ome cau&s;e for believing that the moi&s;ture of a country, abounding with woods, and mar&s;hy grounds, may occa&s;ion the difference in the color of bodies which fall victims to pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>The words <HI>infection</HI> and <HI>contagion,</HI> are u&s;ed by medical writers and in popular cu&s;tom, as &s;ynony|mous, and their etymologies warrant the practice. But I conceive there are di&s;tinctions in this quality or power of di&s;ea&s;es, of communicating them&s;elves
<PB N="xi" REF="036687_0011_100A8A93D1D10130">
by contact or near approach, which require to have each its appropriate language.</P>
<P>That quality of a di&s;ea&s;e which communicates it from a &s;ick to a well per&s;on, on &s;imply inhaling the breath or effluvia from the per&s;on of the di&s;ea&s;ed, at any time and in any place, maybe called <HI>&s;pecific contagion.</HI> Such is the contagion of the &s;mall-pox and the mea&s;les, which are therefore called <HI>conta|gious</HI> di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>That quality of a di&s;ea&s;e which, tho in&s;alutary will not communicate it, without the aid of other cau&s;es, as warm weather, or peculiar &s;ituation and habit of body, and which requires the healthful per&s;on to be a con&s;iderable time, under its influence, to give it effect, may be called <HI>infection.</HI> Such is the quality of the plague, in all its forms, dy&s;en|tery, and all typhus fevers. It may perhaps be po&s;&s;ible for the effluvia of tho&s;e who have the&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es, to be &s;o concentrated and virulent, as to communicate them to a per&s;on in health, by a &s;in|gle in&s;piration of air into the lungs. But if &s;uch can be the ca&s;e in any in&s;tance, it is not the ordi|nary &s;tate of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. Even in the plague, many attendants on the &s;ick never receive the di&s;ea&s;e at all; and in mo&s;t ca&s;es, healthful per&s;ons may, for hours, breathe the air of the rooms where the patients are, without any injury.</P>
<P>Hence infection is capable of all degrees of ac|tivity and force, from a &s;light impurity of air, which affects no per&s;on in health, to that virulent &s;tate of air, which will produce vomiting in a per|&s;on &s;uddenly expo&s;ed to it. <HI>Infection</HI> is u&s;ually ren|dered inactive by &s;evere cold; <HI>&s;pecific contagion</HI> is
<PB N="xii" REF="036687_0012_100A8A95613845C0">
never de&s;troyed, but often rendered more active by cold. Hence the winter in northern latitudes u&s;u|ally puts an end to the plague, but makes no fa|vorable alteration in the &s;mall-pox. There are &s;ome exceptions to this remark, as it regards the plague, which will be noticed in the following work.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;tinctions, which will appear, in the cour&s;e of this treati&s;e to be well founded, have never been defined or u&s;ed by European phy&s;icians, &s;o far as my information extends; and to the want of them, are to be a&s;cribed many errors and ab&s;urdi|ties in opinion, as well as warm controver&s;ies in re|gard to the contagion of the plague.</P>
<P>That &s;tate of our atmo&s;phere which produces di&s;ea&s;e, or di&s;po&s;es the body to di&s;ea&s;e, independ|ent of other cau&s;es, I call <HI>general</HI> or <HI>primary</HI> conta|gion. Synonymous with the&s;e phra&s;es, will be u&s;ed a pe&s;tilential &s;tate or con&s;titution of the air.</P>
<P>The word <HI>pe&s;tilence</HI> may be u&s;ed as &s;ynonymous with plague; or as expre&s;&s;ing all kinds of conta|gious and infectious epidemics. I have u&s;ed it in both &s;en&s;es; and often to expre&s;s an idea of that &s;eries of epidemics which are clo&s;ely connected with the plague.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e di&s;tinctions are ju&s;t or not, is not very material; it is &s;ufficient that they will expre&s;s my ideas in the following treati&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. Of the diver&s;ity of opinions re&s;pecting the cau&s;e and origin pe&s;tilence.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the date of the earlie&s;t hi&s;torical records, the opin|ions of men have been divided on the &s;ubject of the cau&s;es and origin of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es. All enquiries of the philo&s;opher and the phy&s;ician have hitherto been baffled, and inve&s;tigations, often repeated, have ended without leading to &s;atisfactory con|clu&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the hi&s;tory of opinions on this my&s;terious &s;ubject, there is a remarkable di&s;tinction between the ancients and moderns. The ancients derived mo&s;t of their knowledge and &s;cience from per&s;onal ob&s;ervation, as they had very few books and little aid from the improvements of their predece&s;&s;ors. The philo&s;o|phers of antiquity, attentive to changes in the &s;ea&s;ons and to the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, attempted to trace pe&s;ti|lential di&s;ea&s;es to extraordinary vici&s;&s;itudes in the weather, and to the a&s;pects of the planets. Modern philo&s;ophers and phy&s;i|cians, on the other hand, unable to account for pe&s;tilence on the principle of extraordinary &s;ea&s;ons, and di&s;daining to admit the influence of the planets to be the cau&s;e, have re&s;orted to in|vi&s;ible animalculae, and to infection concealed in bales of goods or old clothes, tran&s;ported from Egypt or Con&s;tantinople, and let loo&s;e, at certain periods, to &s;courge mankind and de&s;olate the earth.</P>
<P>In both periods of the world, the common ma&s;s of people, u&s;ually ignorant and always inclined to believe in the marvellous,
<PB N="10" REF="036687_0014_100A8A9BDF922358">
have cut the Gordian knot of difficulty, by a&s;cribing pe&s;tilence to the immediate exerci&s;e of divine power; under the impre&s;|&s;ion that the plague is one of the judgments which God, in his wrath, inflicts on mankind to puni&s;h them for their iniquities.</P>
<P>Without deciding on the comparative merit of the&s;e re&s;pect|ive opinions, it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that they are all probably incorrect; and tho&s;e of the philo&s;ophers, altogether inadequate to explain the origin of pe&s;tilential Epidemics.</P>
<P>It may however be of u&s;e to in&s;ert, in this place, the expla|nations of the cau&s;e of pe&s;tilence, given by &s;ome of the princi|pal writers on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Hippocrates, the father of medical &s;cience, and a man of very acute ob&s;ervation, con&s;idered pe&s;tilence as the effect of partic|ular &s;ea&s;ons and winds.

<P>Galen followed the &s;ame theory. He &s;ays that pe&s;tilent di&s;|ea&s;es ari&s;e from a putridity of the air; and in another place, <HI>a coeli &s;tatu,</HI> from the &s;tate of the air or weather.</P>
<BIBL>p. 627, in Hippoc.&mdash;</BIBL>
<P>It will at once occur to an intelligent reader, that a particular de&s;cription of weather, producing pe&s;tilence, mu&s;t be principal|ly calculated for a particular country or latitude. The &s;tate of &s;ea&s;ons which Hippocrates calls <HI>pe&s;tilential,</HI> is evidently calcula|ted to produce or augment autumnal di&s;ea&s;es in temperate lati|tudes; and is preci&s;ely the &s;tate of weather which exi&s;ted in the United States in 1795, when the bilious plague prevailed in the cities of New-York, Baltimore and Norfolk. But it does not corre&s;pond with the &s;ea&s;on in 1793, when the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e raged in Philadelphia; for that was exce&s;&s;ively dry, nor with the &s;ummer of 1797, which was temperate, in re&s;pect to heat, cold and moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>Hippocrates indeed &s;eems to have been aware that the &s;ea&s;ons alone were not &s;ufficient to account for pe&s;tilence, for he &s;peaks of <HI>to theion,</HI> &s;ome divine principle in the air, by which modern

<P>The philo&s;ophical warrior and hi&s;torian, Ammianus Marcel|linus, after mentioning a plague which broke out in Amida, a city of Per&s;ia, when be&s;ieged by Sapor A. D. 359, from the corruption of numerous dead bodies which lay unburied in the &s;treets, proceeds to unfold the cau&s;es of pe&s;tilential di&s;tempers, in the following manner.</P>
<P>"Philo&s;ophers and eminent phy&s;icians have taught that pe&s;ti|lence is produced by exce&s;s of heat or cold, of drouth of moi&s;|ture. Whence it is that tho&s;e who live near wet and mar&s;hy places are &s;ubject to coughs, di&s;ea&s;es of the eyes and the like. Tho&s;e, on the other hand, who re&s;ide where the heat is great, are troubled with febrile complaints; and in proportion as the matter of fire is more active, drouth is more rapid in de&s;troying life. Hence, during the war of ten years in Greece, this &s;pe|cies of di&s;ea&s;e prevailed, and it was &s;aid that men peri&s;hed by the <HI>weapons of Apollo,</HI> by which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be meant, the <HI>heat of the &s;un.</HI> And, according to Thucydides, the mortality among the Athenians, in the beginning of the Peloponne&s;ian war, was occa&s;ioned by an acute di&s;ea&s;e, which proceeded from the fervid regions of Ethiopia, and gradually extended to Attica.</P>
<P>"Others are of opinion that air, like water, vitiated by the effluvia of dead bodies, or &s;imilar &s;ub&s;tances, is deprived of its &s;alubrity; or at lea&s;t that a &s;udden change of air will product the more &s;light complaints. Some al&s;o affirm that the air, ren|dered gro&s;s by a den&s;er vapor from the earth, clo&s;ing the pores of the body and checking per&s;piration, becomes fatal to the lives of &s;ome; for which rea&s;on, other animals than man, which are continually bending towards the earth, are the fir&s;t victims to pe&s;tilence, as Homer te&s;tifies, and which is proved by many examples, during the prevalence of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t &s;pecies of plague is called <HI>pandemic,</HI> and this af|flicts mo&s;t &s;everely tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to exce&s;&s;ive heat, in hot regions. The &s;econd is denominated <HI>epidemic,</HI> which when

<BIBL>Lib. 19.</BIBL>
<P>The hi&s;torian has here explained the cau&s;es of ordinary di&s;|ea&s;es, occa&s;ioned by extremes of weather, mar&s;h effluvia, vitia|ted air, and the direct action of violent heat, or &s;troke of the &s;un. No per&s;on will di&s;pute the ju&s;tne&s;s of his remarks, for the &s;ame cau&s;es, at this day, produce the &s;ame effects. But the cau&s;es a&s;&s;igned are not adequate to all the effects, which we wi&s;h to explain. They do not uniformly occa&s;ion pe&s;tilence; and on the other hand, pe&s;tilence &s;ometimes rages without the influence of tho&s;e cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Aetius, an eminent phy&s;ician, about the clo&s;e of the 5th cen|tury, compiled the opinions and methods of cure practi&s;ed by the mo&s;t celebrated of his predece&s;&s;ors. In this compilation, entitled "Tetrabiblos," chap. ix. we find the following para|graph on the &s;ubject of Epidemic di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e are called popular or epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, which &s;pring from a common cau&s;e, as bad food or water, immoderate grief or want of cu&s;tomary exerci&s;e, hunger or repletion, e&s;pecially when abundance &s;ucceeds extreme want. But the nature of the country often cau&s;es epidemic di&s;ea&s;es: the air we breathe being vitiated by the evaporation from putrid &s;ub&s;tances. The&s;e &s;ub|&s;tances are multitudes of dead bodies after battles, mar&s;hes or &s;tagnant water in the vicinity, which emit poi&s;onous and fetid vapours.&mdash;This cau&s;e is in continual operation. And the air which &s;urrounds us, always changes its temperament, when it becomes immoderately hot or cold, dry or humid. To other cau&s;es we are not all equally expo&s;ed, nor at all times; but the circumambient air, when we are abroad, &s;urrounds us all alike, and is inhaled with the breath.</P>
<P>"Sometimes the &s;urrounding air, becoming unu&s;ually humid and hot, induces a pe&s;tilential con&s;titution; and as humors, tending to putrefaction, are collected in the body by eating un|whole&s;ome food, this air becomes the &s;ource of a pe&s;tilential fever. Therefore if a per&s;on takes moderate exerci&s;e, and is

temperate and regular in his diet [victu mode&s;to ac ca&s;tigato] he wholly e&s;capes all affections of this kind."</P>
<P>Such were the opinions of the phy&s;ic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s and philo&s;ophers of antiquity. No di&s;tinction appears to have been made by them, between the plague and other pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es. All were a&s;cribed to the &s;ame cau&s;es.</P>
<P>At what time the di&s;tinction between <HI>Pe&s;tis</HI> and <HI>Pe&s;tilentia</HI> was fir&s;t made, has not occurred to my enquiries. But I find it in the writings of Pro&s;per Alpinus, a Venetian phy&s;ician, who wrote about the clo&s;e of the 16th century, and who had been, for &s;ome years, a practitioner in Egypt. This author maintains that pe&s;tilent fevers are occa&s;ioned by local cau&s;es, as vitiated air, and by peculiarities of &s;ea&s;on, as extreme heat and humid|ity. But he a&s;&s;erts that the plague in Egypt rarely proceeds from corrupted air, and never, except after an unu&s;ual overflow|ing of the Nile, when that river has exceeded its common bounds. He contends that if this di&s;ea&s;e was produced by noxious exhalations from putrid and &s;tagnant water, and mar&s;hy places, it would occur every year. He therefore concludes for certain that the plague is u&s;ually imported from Greece, Syria, Barbary, or Turkey. "Plerumque igitur id genus morbi ibi contagio ex aliis locis a&s;portari &s;olet." The contagion of the plague is u&s;ually imported from other countries.</P>
<BIBL>Rerum. Egypt. vol. 2, p. 73, vol. 3, 61, and vol. 4, 299.</BIBL>
<P>The &s;ame author a&s;&s;erts that the plague brought from Barbary is more malignant and of longer duration, than when brought from Greece or Syria.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck, an eminent Dutch phy&s;ician of the la&s;t cen|tury, has recorded an account of a violent plague in Nemueguen in 1636, and &s;ubjoined to it the be&s;t treati&s;e on the origin of that di&s;ea&s;e, which I have been able to find, tho in one or two particulars, his ideas are very inaccurate. This author, who&s;e treati&s;e, I am &s;urpri&s;ed to find, is little known in this country, a&s;&s;igns three cau&s;es of the pe&s;tis or true plague. Fir&s;t, the ju&s;t anger of heaven, provoked by the exhalations from the &s;inks of our &s;ins and abominable deeds. Secondly, a mo&s;t malignant, poi&s;onous, and to human nature, deadly pe&s;tilent germ, [&s;emi|narium]
<PB N="14" REF="036687_0018_100A8AA5A1E25100">
like a &s;ubtle fermentum or leaven, &s;ent from heaven, in a very &s;mall quantity, diffu&s;ing it&s;elf through the air like a &s;ubtle gas, and rendering it impure. This gas, he &s;uppo&s;es to &s;pread over many regions its numerous particles, and to impre&s;s on the air an infection like poi&s;on, which often affects not only many per&s;ons, but almo&s;t the whole world.</P>
<P>However whim&s;ical we may think this author's explanation of the pe&s;tilent principle; that &s;ome &s;uch general cau&s;e exi&s;ts in the atmo&s;phere, at certain periods, will be rendered very probable, if not certain, by the facts hereafter to be related.</P>
<P>The "&s;eminarium e coelo demi&s;&s;um" of Diemerbroeck &s;eems to be the <HI>to theion</HI> of Hippocrates. In what the e&s;&s;ence of this principle con&s;i&s;ts, is not known; but there mu&s;t be an alteration in the chymical properties of the atmo&s;phere to &s;olve the diffi|culties that attend our inquiries into the cau&s;e of pe&s;tilence.&mdash; That this alteration is the effect of a poi&s;on, "e coelo demi&s;&s;um," is an hypothe&s;is un&s;upported by facts and wholly incredible.</P>
<P>The third cau&s;e of pe&s;tilence, mentioned by this author, is infection.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck al&s;o maintains the di&s;tinction between <HI>pe&s;tis</HI> and <HI>pe&s;tilentia.</HI> The latter is &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from foul exhala|tions, intemperate &s;ea&s;ons and the like. But the plague, he contends, cannot be occa&s;ioned by tho&s;e cau&s;es, tho the&s;e may aid the &s;eminarium or general cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Van Helmont, a Flemi&s;h writer of &s;ome celebrity, in the la&s;t century, maintains that the plague cannot be a&s;cribed to the "importunate and un&s;ea&s;onable changes of times, nor to pu|trefaction;" that the "poi&s;on of the plague is a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ecret one from any other;" that the "matter of that di&s;ea&s;e is a wild &s;pirit tinged with poi&s;on, exhaling from a di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on, or drawn inwards from a gas of the earth putrified by continuance, and receiving internally an appropriate ferment, and by degrees attaining a pe&s;tilent poi&s;on in us." "The remote, crude and fir&s;t occa&s;ional matter of the pe&s;tilence, is an air putrified thro' continuance, or rather a hoary putrified gas, which putrefaction of the air, hath not the 8200th part of its &s;eminal body." This explanation &s;eems to be hardly intelligible.</P>

<P>Hodges, who wrote a treati&s;e on the great plague in London in 1665, ob&s;erves that the air &s;uffers &s;ome e&s;&s;ential alteration which is nece&s;&s;ary to favor the propagation of pe&s;tilence. The nitro-aerial principle, which cau&s;es or in vigorates vegetable and animal life, &s;ometimes becomes imperfect, degenerate or cor|rupt, being tainted with &s;omething pernicious to vitality. He calls it poi&s;onous, and ob&s;erves that it proves injurious to trees and cattle, as well as to man. He &s;uppo&s;es the corrupting prin|ciple to be a &s;ubtle aura or vapor extricated from the bowels of the earth. To this cau&s;e al&s;o he a&s;cribes the death of fi&s;h du|ring periods of pe&s;tilence. At the &s;ame time he contends that the infecting principle is generated in Africa or A&s;ia, and con|veyed to other countries. The &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e he &s;uppo&s;es to be in the animal &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Van Swieten maintains that the cau&s;e of Epidemics is in the hidden qualities of the air, and inexplicable. He &s;uppo&s;es it not impo&s;&s;ible that exhalations in earthquakes may augment or le&s;&s;en the deleterious quality of the air in pe&s;tilence.</P>
<BIBL>Com. vol. 16, 47.</BIBL>
<P>Sydenham not only agrees with Diemerbroeck, Van Swieten, and others, in a&s;cribing pe&s;tilence to occult qualities in the air, but has entered into the &s;ubject of explaining the peculiar &s;ymp|toms of di&s;ea&s;es by the influence of an Epidemic con&s;titution of the air. His <HI>occult qualities</HI> have been ridiculed by later phy&s;i|cians, and &s;o far as his theory, in this re&s;pect, has been neg|lected, the &s;cience of medicin has degenerated. If I mi&s;take not, it can be made evident, that one of the mo&s;t important, as well as mo&s;t difficult branches of medical &s;cience, is to a&s;|certain the effect of the reigning con&s;titution of air, on prevail|ing di&s;ea&s;es, and to apply that knowledge to the cure of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Dr. Mead's treati&s;e on the plague has been much admired and celebrated; yet I will a&s;&s;ert, that next to the "Trait&egrave; de

<P>His e&s;&s;ay is intended to demon&s;trate that the plague is propa|gated by &s;pecific contagion only, and he attempts to prove that this di&s;ea&s;e, like the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les, has been bred in E|gypt or Ethiopia, and thence propagated and entailed on Europe.</P>

<P>In &s;upport of this theory he even goes &s;o far as to call in que&s;|tion the unanimous te&s;timony of hi&s;torians, who relate that the terrible plague of 1347, 8, 9, and 50, began in Cathay, China.

<P>In oppo&s;ition to all the&s;e great authorities, it will probably be proved, that the plague generally, if not always originates, in the country where it exi&s;ts as an epidemic. The common opinion of the propagation of pe&s;tilence &s;olely by infection, has had a mo&s;t calamitous effect on medicin and on human happine&s;s. It has prevented the re&s;earches of acute modern philo&s;ophers and phy&s;icians, who might have been able, by diligence and a comprehen&s;ive view of the &s;ubject, to trace pe&s;tilence to its real cau&s;es, and to &s;ugge&s;t the true means of avoiding this terrible &s;courge.</P>
<P>Thomp&s;on who travelled in Egypt about the year 1734, and who&s;e account of that country has not been mended by modern travellers, ob&s;erves, "The coming and going of the plague are two things not ea&s;ily to be accounted for, notwith&s;tanding we

are a&s;&s;ured of the facts in a mo&s;t unque&s;tionable manner. That the infection is propagated in the air, and thereby tran&s;ferred from place to place, &s;eems to be a matter out of di&s;pute; but how it is generated therein, we are much at a lo&s;s to determine." He proceeds to &s;tate, like many others, "that the plague is generally brought into Egypt from Con&s;tantinople or by Cara|vans from the &s;outhern countries." And on the whole he thinks it rarely generated in that country.</P>

<P>In the Monthly Review vol. 33, there is an account of the plague in Con&s;tantinople, by Dr. Mackenzie, in which are &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages worthy of notice. After a&s;&s;erting his opinion that this di&s;temper can be communicated only by the touch or near ap|proach, he adds, "that both here and at Smyrna, the plague breaks out, in &s;ome years, when it is not po&s;&s;ible to trace whence it is conveyed." He &s;uppo&s;es the di&s;ea&s;e to proceed from "venomous moleculae lodged in wool, cotton, hair, leather and &s;kins," in hou&s;es not well clean&s;ed after pe&s;tilence; but that the plague from this &s;ource is not &s;o fatal as when it comes from abroad. The air he thinks no otherwi&s;e concerned in produ|cing the di&s;ea&s;e, than as "a vehicle to convey the venomous particles from one body to another."</P>
<P>Dr. Chandler, in his account of a plague in Smyrna, has near|ly the &s;ame idea, as Mackenzie, with re&s;pect to the origin of the di&s;ea&s;e. He &s;ays "the plague might perhaps be truly defined, a di&s;ea&s;e ari&s;ing from certain animalculae, probably invi&s;ible, which burrow and form their nidus in the human body. The&s;e whether generated in Egypt or el&s;ewhere, &s;ub&s;i&s;t always in &s;ome places &s;uited to their nature. <HI>They are imported almo&s;t annually into Smyrna,</HI> and this &s;pecies is commonly de&s;troyed by inten&s;e heat. They are lea&s;t fatal at the beginning and latter end of the &s;ea&s;on. If they arrive early in the &s;pring, they are weak; but gather &s;trength, multiply and then peri&s;h. The pores of the &s;kin, opened by the weather, readily admit them."</P>
<P>Baron de Tott in his memoirs ob&s;erves&punc; The re&s;earches I have carefully made concerning the plague, which I once believ|ed to originate in Egypt, have convinced me, that it would not be &s;o much as known there, were not the &s;eeds of it conveyed

<P>Dr. Patrick Ru&s;&s;el has publi&s;hed a quarto volume on the plague of Aleppo in 1760, and the &s;ubject of quarantine. In this work, he has pre&s;erved a number of important facts, but without under|&s;tanding the &s;ubject &s;ufficiently to apply them to u&s;eful purpo&s;es. All his theory and practical remarks are founded on the vulgar &s;uppo&s;ition of the origin of that di&s;ea&s;e in one or two cities only, and its propagation by &s;pecific contagion&mdash;a &s;uppo&s;ition totally unfounded; his treati&s;e of cour&s;e will be found of little value, in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Mr. Volney. with all his philo&s;ophy and &s;everal months re&s;i|dence in Egypt, furni&s;hes no additional light, on the &s;ubject of the origin of pe&s;tilence. He &s;ays, "&s;ome per&s;ons have attemp|ted to e&s;tabli&s;h an opinion, that the plague originates in Egypt; but this &s;uppo&s;ition, <HI>founded on vague prejudices,</HI> &s;eems to be di&s;|proved by facts." This is an extraordinary a&s;&s;ertion for a man who has the character of a philo&s;opher. And on what author|ity does it re&s;t? Simply on the declaration of European Merch|ants who have been &s;ettled for many years at Alexandria, and of the Egyptians, who &s;ay that the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appears in Alexan|dria, and that it is invariably preceded by an arrival from Smyr|na or Con&s;tantinople. Therefore this philo&s;opher concludes, "that the di&s;ea&s;e certainly originates from Con&s;tantinople, where it is perpetuated by the ab&s;urd negligence of the Turks, who publicly &s;ell the effects of per&s;ons who die of that di&s;temper." Here we have another great man a&s;cribing this va&s;t effect, an epidemic pe&s;tilence, to &s;o trifling a cau&s;e, as infection pre&s;erved in furs, woolens, and old clothes!</P>
<P>What is &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing, the &s;ame author adopts the ideas of the Egyptians, which Pro&s;per Alpinus had adopted before him and which he has evidently copied from Alpinus, that a plague coming from one country is le&s;s malignant than when it comes from another, as tho there could be a difference in the <HI>&s;pecific</HI> contagion of the di&s;ea&s;e, when produced in different coun|tries.

<P>It is really &s;urpri&s;ing that, if the fact is well evidenced, that a plague proceeding from one country is more malignant than one proceeding from another, men of exten&s;ive erudition and ob&s;ervation &s;hould not undertake to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome rational cau&s;e for the phenomenon, rather than to propagate the vulgar tales and opinions of the Egyptians.</P>
<P>From this lengthy &s;tatement of opinions in regard to the ori|gin and cau&s;es of pe&s;tilence; opinions weak, contradictory, ab|&s;urd or inaccurate, what conclu&s;ion &s;hall be drawn. This, mo&s;t evidently, that the <HI>&s;ubject is not under&s;tood.</HI> Perhaps it never will be under&s;tood. But &s;urely a &s;ubject &s;o intere&s;ting to the life and happine&s;s of man, de&s;erves mo&s;t critical and laborious enquiry. A &s;ubject which concerns the lives of millions of the human race ought not to be abandoned by the man of &s;cience, until every effort to find the truth &s;hall have been exhau&s;ted. Yet &s;trange as it may appear, even a hi&s;tory of pe&s;tilence that all devouring &s;courge which has &s;wept away a large portion of the human race in every age, is yet a de&s;ideratum in our libraries.</P>
<P>To &s;upply in part this defect, and to &s;timulate further re|&s;earches into the origin of this frequent and formidable calamity, I will recite &s;uch hi&s;torical accounts of the plague, as an im|perfect examination of authors has enabled me to collect. And as the mo&s;t accurate ob&s;ervers of the operations of nature, have &s;ugge&s;ted the probability that pe&s;tilential epidemics are cau&s;ed by &s;ome occult qualities in the air, or by vapor from the internal parts of the earth, or by planetary influence, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to enquire how far &s;uch &s;ugge&s;tions are &s;upported by facts. For this purpo&s;e, I &s;hall note, as I proceed, any extra|ordinary occurrence or phenomena in the phy&s;ical world, as earthquakes, eruptions of volcanoes, appearance of comets, vi|olent tempe&s;ts, unu&s;ual &s;ea&s;ons, and other &s;ingular events and circum&s;tances, which may appear to be connected with pe&s;ti|lence,

either as cau&s;e or effect, or as the effect of a common cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of this proce&s;s will probably be a refutation of &s;ome of the foregoing opinions, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch as are more rational and philo&s;ophical.</P>
<P>It is proper however to premi&s;e, that this inve&s;tigation, which has been pur&s;ued but a few months only, amid&s;t other occupa|tions, has been &s;ubjected to inconveniences peculiar to the Uni|ted States. No man can find in this country <HI>all</HI> the books ne|ce&s;&s;ary for a complete examination of a hi&s;torical or &s;cientific &s;ubject. The public libraries in New-York and New-Haven, tho very valuable, are deficient. Tho&s;e of Harvard College and Philadelphia, are more exten&s;ive, but incomplete. I have examined them all, tho in &s;ome of them I could &s;pend but little time; yet in none of them could I find all the authorities which it was my wi&s;h and intention to con&s;ult.</P>
<P>It is further to be premi&s;ed, that I have, as far as it could be done, re&s;orted to original hi&s;torians for my facts and authorities. This is certainly the only &s;afe method for a compiler; but in the United States, it cannot be pur&s;ued with complete &s;ucce&s;s, for want of the original writers of the local hi&s;tories of countries. Mo&s;t of the Greek and Roman authors are to be obtained in our public or private libraries; but &s;ome of the be&s;t hi&s;torians of Italy, Germany, the Baltic nations and Spain, who have lived within the la&s;t four or five centuries, are not to be found; others are in the original languages, which I do not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>As to the modern hi&s;torical compilations in my native lan|guage, they are almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s on this &s;ubject. The mo&s;t able and celebrated of them, Hume, Robert&s;on, Smollet, Rapin and Gibbon, have pa&s;&s;ed over mo&s;t of the plagues which have de&s;olated cities and countries, without notice, or with &s;ome general remarks which afford little light on the &s;ubject of their origin.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t modern writers appear to think every thing beneath their notice, except war and political intrigues. They detail, with di&s;gu&s;ting minutene&s;s, whatever relates to the definition or an|noyance of mankind by the ambition of princes and demagogues;
<PB N="23" REF="036687_0027_100A8ABB9F3C1BE8">
while they omit or &s;lightly mention whatever regards the civil and dome&s;tic economy, the private manners and habits, the arts, the health, and the &s;ocial happine&s;s of nations. To this de|&s;cription, Dr. Henry's Hi&s;tory of England, is an exception.</P>
<P>Nor have modern travellers furni&s;hed us with many valuable materials to &s;upply the defects of our hi&s;tories. They pa&s;s from country to country; examine and de&s;cribe a few external ob|jects, &s;uch as cities, buildings, paintings and &s;tatues, but leave more u&s;eful &s;ubjects unexamined, and return home with a book of vulgar tales and errors.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to u&s;eful hi&s;tory, the ancient authors have the preference over the modern. Modern compilers appear to have written for fame or for money, rather than for the &s;ake of en|folding and diffu&s;ing truth. Hence they have principally at|tended to tho&s;e animated periods of the world, which were di&s;|tingui&s;hed for great achievments; or tho&s;e prominent events, a de&s;cription of which would intere&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions of their readers: Or they have &s;elected for de&s;cription &s;uch parts of the hi&s;tory of nations as would enable them to adorn their works with an elevated &s;tyle; omitting a multitude of &s;ubordinate facts, as below the dignity of hi&s;tory. Others appear to have undertaken hi&s;torical compilation, &s;olely or principally to &s;up|port &s;ome preconceived &s;y&s;tem of government or religion; and have &s;tudied to bend the evidence of facts, to the accompli&s;h|ment of that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations have ari&s;en out of my enquiries, relative to pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es. I have di&s;covered that many of the hi&s;tories or rather abridgements and compilations which are al|mo&s;t the only authorities con&s;ulted by American readers in gen|eral, are very incomplete; and no man who relies on them only, and neglects original writers, can acquire an accurate and com|prehen&s;ive knowledge of hi&s;tory.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. Hi&s;torical view of pe&s;tilential epidemics, and the phenomena in the phy&s;ical world, which precede, attend or follow them, from the earlie&s;t accounts, to the Chri&s;tian era.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an agreed point that the five books of Mo&s;es are the mo&s;t ancient authentic hi&s;tory now extant. In the very thre&s;h|hold of this genuine hi&s;tory, we meet with accounts of the plague in Egypt. In the fifth chapter of Exodus, the pe&s;tilence is mentioned as a formidable calamity.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that throughout the hi&s;tory of the Jews, and in the prophets, <HI>pe&s;tilence, famin</HI> and <HI>the &s;word</HI> are often men|tioned in connection with each other, and de&s;cribed as the mo&s;t dreadful calamities that can befal mankind. It will probably appear that famin and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es do at times recipro|cally produce each other, and that war not unfrequently occa|&s;ions both. But there is ground to believe that famin and pe&s;|tilence are u&s;ually the effects of one common cau&s;e. In the Bible, as in other ancient writings, no di&s;tinction is made be|tween general pe&s;tilence which &s;preads over whole countries, and tho&s;e autumnal epidemics, which are evidently produced by powerful local cau&s;es. There are however many pa&s;&s;ages in &s;cripture that corroborate the principles re&s;pecting pe&s;tilence, which are &s;till ob&s;erved, and which doubtle&s;s depend on e&s;tab|li&s;hed laws of nature.</P>
<P>When David was &s;ummoned to receive his puni&s;hment for numbering the children of I&s;rael, he was permitted to elect one of the three calamities, famin, the &s;word or pe&s;tilence. For a pious rea&s;on, he preferred pe&s;tilence, and &s;eventy thou&s;and of his &s;ubjects peri&s;hed.</P>

<P><PB N="25" REF="036687_0029_100A8ABF01799428">The prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel, in their denunciations, &s;peak often of the&s;e three judgments, and in a way that authorizes the opinion, that they con&s;idered them all to be clo&s;ely connected. It is however remarkable that pe&s;tilence is every where men|tioned as the peculiar &s;courge of <HI>cities.</HI></P>
<P>In the 21&s;t chapter of Jeremiah, the &s;iege of Jeru&s;alem is foretold. "I will &s;mite the inhabitants of this <HI>city,</HI> both man and bea&s;t; they &s;hall die with a great pe&s;tilence. He that abi|deth in this <HI>city</HI> &s;hall die by the &s;word, by the famin and by the pe&s;tilence; but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chal|deans that be&s;iege you, <HI>he &s;hall live,</HI> and his life &s;hall be to him for a prey."</P>
<P>Ezekiel v. 12. declares that a <HI>third part</HI> of the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem &s;hall die by pe&s;tilence. This is a proportion which is not uncommon, in violent plagues. In the &s;eventh chapter, the &s;ame prophet &s;ays, "The &s;word is <HI>without,</HI> and the pe&s;ti|lence and famin <HI>within</HI>; he that is in the field, &s;hall die with the &s;word; and he that is in the <HI>city,</HI> famin and pe&s;tilence &s;hall devour him."</P>
<P>Another pa&s;&s;age in the &s;ame prophet de&s;erves notice. Chap. xxxiii, it is &s;aid, "Thus &s;aith the Lord, as I live, &s;urely they that are in the wa&s;tes &s;hall fall by the &s;word, and him that is in the open field will I give to the bea&s;ts to be devoured, and they that be in the <HI>forts</HI> and the <HI>caves</HI> &s;hall die of the pe&s;tilence."</P>
<P>In the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, we have proof that in the time of the&s;e prophets, it was con&s;idered as a well known fact, that pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es are the effect of crouded propulation, raging peculiarly in <HI>cities, forts</HI> and other confined places. No evidence appears, in the&s;e early records, that the ancients, who lived in countries &s;ub|ject to plague, and near to Egypt, had any idea of the convey|ance of the di&s;temper from place to place by infection. It was con&s;idered as a judgment of heaven; and piety &s;till recognizes this idea; to which, in a moral and religious view, there can be no objection. But philo&s;ophy endeavors to trace the hand of heaven through the medium of &s;econd cau&s;es; and the facts re|corded

of pe&s;tilence in &s;cripture, lend their aid to accompli&s;h the object.</P>
<P>In 1 Samuel v. and vi. we have an account of the pe&s;tilence among the Phili&s;tines, inflicted on them as a puni&s;hment for the king the ark from the Jews, in which fifty thou&s;and of the in|habitants of Beth &s;heme&s;h peri&s;hed. This plague is called <HI>eme|rods</HI> and a <HI>deadly de&s;truction.</HI> This pa&s;&s;age is noted on account of the &s;pecification of the time of the year, when the di&s;ea&s;e pre|vailed. It is &s;aid, the ark was in the country of the Phili&s;tince <HI>&s;even months,</HI> and was returned, during wheat-harve&s;t, &s;oon after which it is under&s;tood, the plague cea&s;ed. Now wheat harve&s;t, in Syria, is in May; and it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, the pe&s;tilence was mo&s;t violent in the period next preceding that time, viz. April, or during the month of May, for it was the &s;everity of the di&s;|ea&s;e which induced them to &s;end back the ark.&mdash;This account corre&s;ponds with the modern cour&s;e of pe&s;tilence in that country. It appears in February or March, increa&s;es till May or June, then gradually di&s;appears.</P>
<BIBL>See A. Ru&s;&s;el. Hi&s;t. of Aleppo. P. Ru&s;&s;el on the plague at Aleppo.</BIBL>
<P>In this ca&s;e, modern facts confirm the accuracy of the &s;crip|ture-hi&s;tory; at the &s;ame time, they e&s;tabli&s;h the identity of the di&s;ea&s;e with modern plague, and the uniformity in the ope|rations of the laws of nature. They prove further that the climate of that country has &s;uffered no material alteration.</P>
<P>In the eleventh chapter of Numbers, we have an account of a plague among the I&s;raelites, occa&s;ioned by their eating great quantities of the fle&s;h of quails, after being &s;ome time de&s;titute of animal food&mdash;an obvious effect in the hot climates of Egypt and Arabia.</P>
<P>The &s;cripture-hi&s;tory al&s;o furni&s;hes us with ample proof that Egypt was, in early times, the nur&s;ery of plague&mdash;known and con&s;idered as &s;uch, centuries before the foundation of Smyrna, Con&s;tantinople, or other large cities in Greece or A&s;ia Minor.</P>
<P>In Deuteronomy xxviii. the I&s;raelites are warned again&s;t di&s;|obedience to the laws of Mo&s;es, and in ca&s;e of di&s;regarding them, are threatened with the di&s;ea&s;es of Egypt, the botch, the emerods and the &s;cab. The&s;e are &s;till prevailing di&s;orders in

<P>The&s;e authorities of high antiquity leave no room for doubt or controver&s;y, on the que&s;tion, whether Egypt originates the plague. The evidence is deci&s;ive again&s;t tho&s;e modern &s;uperfi|cial philo&s;ophers, who hold in contempt the mo&s;t authentic an|cient hi&s;tory, becau&s;e it has claims to in&s;piration. Yet infidels, if they were not too wi&s;e to read, examin and be informed, might be convinced of the authenticity of the &s;cripture hi&s;tory, by comparing the facts related, with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world. The pre&s;ent endemical and other di&s;ea&s;es which often occur in Egypt, an&s;wer &s;o exactly to the de&s;cription given of them in the books of Mo&s;es, as to leave no room to que&s;tion the genuinene&s;s of tho&s;e books. It was the peculiar climate of Egypt, and the u&s;ual prevalence of &s;corbutic and malignant complaints, in that country, which occa&s;ioned all the minute injunctions of Mo&s;es, in regard to wa&s;hing, clean&s;ing and purifi|cations. The &s;ame or &s;imilar regulations were enjoined by the laws of Egypt.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been controverted whether Mo&s;es borrowed his &s;y&s;tem of pu|rification from the in&s;titutions which he found in Egypt; or whether the Egyptians borrowed the idea from the laws of Mo&s;es. Nothing can be more idle than &s;uch a di&s;pute. The experience of men would very readily &s;ugge&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity and utility of great cleanline&s;s, to pre&s;erve health in the climate of Egypt. The cu&s;tom of circumci&s;ion was e&s;tabli&s;hed among the Egyptians, as well as among the I&s;raelites; and Herodotus who vi&s;ited Egypt to collect facts, expre&s;sly declares that the "Egyptians circumci&s;ed their children for the &s;ake of clean|line&s;s." &mdash;There is not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the Egyptians borrowed this cu&s;tom, or others re&s;pecting cleanline&s;s, from the I&s;rael|ites. Nor does it vary the que&s;tion, that the laws of Mo&s;es were the commands of God. Divine commands have rarely introduced a new principle of right and wrong.

He repre|&s;ents the earth as covered with clouds, darkne&s;s and &s;uffocating heat; the &s;outh wind blowing for four months, the lakes and fountains being infected, and the earth over&s;pread with poi&s;onous &s;erpents. The di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t invaded dogs, birds, &s;heep and ox|en; then mankind. Death was &s;udden; and the &s;treets loaded with dead carca&s;es. The &s;ymptoms began with heat in the bowels, &s;lu&s;hings of the face, difficulty of breathing, &amp;c. How far the poet was authorized by hi&s;tory in this de&s;cription, I do not know; but the whole pa&s;&s;age is worth the attention of the learned reader.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="036687_0034_100A8ACB747BA758">Our next accounts of the plague are in the hi&s;tories of Rome; for altho Greece contained the older &s;tates, and had large cities, before the foundation of Rome; yet the mo&s;t populous parts of Greece, Attica and Lacedemon, are dry, rocky coun|tries; not calculated to generate pe&s;tilence nor to favor its prop|agation.</P>
<P>Rome, on the other hand, is &s;ituated in a level country, on the banks of a river, and not far from exten&s;ive mar&s;hes. Un|der the influence of powerful local cau&s;es, this city felt every derangement of the atmo&s;phere, by intemperate &s;ea&s;ons, or other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t plague in Rome happened about the 16th year from its foundation, &s;oon after the murder of Tatius, and in time of peace. "It killed in&s;tantly without any previous &s;ickne&s;s.

<P>Another plague attacked Rome in the reign of Tullius Ho&s;|tilius, about the year 110 or 112, and B. C. about 640. No important particulars are related, except that the &s;ickne&s;s relax|ed the martial &s;pirit of the citizens. To prevent this effect, that warlike prince gave the &s;oldiers no re&s;t, judging "&s;alubri|ora militiae, quam domi, juvenum corpora e&s;&s;e," that the young men would be more healthy in the army abroad, than at home.</P>

<P><PB N="32" REF="036687_0036_100A8AD2221140A0">There was an eruption of Etna, according to common chro|nology, in the year of Rome 277, and B. C. 477. This cir|cum&s;tance is &s;trong evidence that the chronology is not quite correct. The eruption took place unque&s;tionably during the pe&s;tilential period, to which this plague in Rome belonged. It might not have been the very year of the plague in Rome, but probably was not &s;o di&s;tant as four years. To which event, the plague or the eruption, a wrong era is a&s;&s;igned, I &s;hall not de|termin. The early hi&s;tory of Rome, from the de&s;truction of the ancient records, by the burning of the city, when taken by the Gauls under Brennus, in the year 365, is &s;ubject to great uncertainty, and authors do not agree on the chronology of that part of the Roman &s;tory.</P>
<P>&rindx; Since writing the foregoing remarks, I have di&s;covered a fact which may &s;erve to aid us in fixing the period of the events abovementioned. In the cour&s;e of this work it will be proved beyond doubt, that the approach of comets to our &s;y&s;tem, has a prodigious influence on the elements of this globe. At pre&s;|ent I &s;hall a&s;&s;ume the fact, that the eruption of Etna above|mentioned, was nearly cotemporary with the appearance of a comet, during this period of pe&s;tilence. In looking into Pliny's Natural Hi&s;tory, lib. 2. ca. 25, I find that a comet was vi&s;ible, at the time of the battle of Salamis. Speaking of the different &s;pecies of comets he &s;ays "Ceratias Cornus &s;peciem habet, qualis fecit cum Graecia apud Salamina depugnavit." "A comet in the figure of a javelin, like that which appeared when Greece fought at Salamis." This battle is fixed by authors in the year B. C. 480, and con&s;equently in the year of Rome, by com|mon chronology 274. It appears to be a general law of nature that the approach of comets to this earth, calls into action the &s;ubterranean fire, and volcanoes di&s;charge their contents, during or within a few months of the appearance of comets. We may &s;afely conclude therefore that the eruption was within a year

or two of the battle of Salamis. This is not certain, but proba|ble; and I am inclined therefore to believe that Hook and others have placed the plague in Rome three or four years too late, or that the eruption is placed too early.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Brydone mentions an eruption in the 77th Olympiad, compre|hending the years of Rome from 282 to 285 inclu&s;ive, which it doubt|le&s;s the &s;ame abovementioned.</NOTE></P>
<P>The army of Xerxes, retreating into A&s;ia, after the lo&s;s of the engagement near Salamis, &s;uffered extremely by pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es. And it will hereafter appear that during periods when the pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air is evidenced by the exi&s;tence of plague in <HI>cities,</HI> armies in the field and &s;eamen on the ocean are much more &s;ubject to epidemic complaints, than at other times.</P>
<P>The land forces which Xerxes left behind him under Mardo|nius, fell a prey to famin and pe&s;tilence. The highways were &s;trewed with dead bodies, and wild fowls and bea&s;ts devoured them.</P>
<P>The &s;ame period was di&s;tingui&s;hed by tempe&s;ts and inunda|tions &mdash;the con&s;tant attendants on comets. A violent &s;torm had de&s;troyed the famous bridge built by the great monarch over the Helle&s;pont, before he returned from Greece; and while the troops under Mardonius were be&s;ieging Potidea, an inundation of the &s;ea broke into their trenches, drowned &s;ome &s;oldiers, and compelled them to rai&s;e the &s;iege.</P>

<P>The&s;e great phenomena, without any hi&s;torical account, would make it nearly certain that a comet appeared at that time, and the pe&s;tilence undoubtedly happened within a &s;hort period of its approach.</P>
<P>A more terrible pe&s;tilence invaded the Roman city and terri|tory, in the year 290, and B. C. 464. Several facts in regard to it, de&s;erve particular notice. "Grave tempus et forte annus pe&s;tilens erat urbi, agri&s;que, nec hominibus magis, quam pecori; et auxere vim morbi, tenore pupulationis, pecoribus agre&s;tibu&s;que, in urbem acceptis.

<BIBL>Livy. lib. 3. 6. Dion Hal. lib. 10.</BIBL>
<P>"This was an unhealthy time and a pe&s;tilent year in town and country, affecting equally men and cattle; and the di&s;ea&s;e was augmented by crouds of countrymen and herds of cattle, which were received within the walls of the city, for fear of being plundered or de&s;troyed [by the Latins and Hernici, who then ravaged the country.] That collection of all kinds of animals in the city, and the unu&s;ual &s;tench occa&s;ioned by them, &s;everely affected both the citizens and the country people, crouded into clo&s;e buildings, depre&s;&s;ed by heat and watching; and their fa|tigue and the contagion &s;pread the &s;ickne&s;s into every quarter."</P>
<P>This is Livy's repre&s;entation. Diony&s;ius Hallicarna&s;&s;us men|tions that the di&s;ea&s;e &s;eized <HI>&s;tuds</HI> of mares, <HI>herds</HI> of oxen, and <HI>flocks</HI> of goats and &s;heep; by which expre&s;&s;ions we are perhaps to under&s;tand, that the di&s;temper either did not &s;eize tho&s;e animals, except in collections, or was remarkably fatal to them in nume|rous bodies&mdash;an idea warranted by modern facts. It is generally true of cattle as of men, that pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es are mo&s;t de&s;truc|tive, where many are collected together; not only by rea&s;on of infection from the di&s;ea&s;ed, but by the diminution of the vital principle of the air by re&s;piration and per&s;piration.</P>
<P>Oro&s;ius lib. 2. 12. adds other circum&s;tances. He &s;ays there was a &s;hort &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of war, when a grievous pe&s;tilence, which never failed to compel the Romans to a truce, or to interrupt it, if made, raged violently through all the city. Many of the pa|tricians were victims, but it was mo&s;t fatal to the poor.</P>
<P>It is &s;tated that this pe&s;tilence began about the calends of Sep|tember and raged in city and country. By country, <HI>agris,</HI> the Roman writers meant the ancient Latium, the modern Com|pagna di Roma, which was naturally unhealthy; tho, in the flouri&s;hing ages of Rome, extremely populous.</P>
<P>That the Roman territory &s;hould be &s;ubject to autumnal com|plaints, is not at all &s;urpri&s;ing. At the port of the Tyber there were unwhole&s;ome mar&s;hes, called by Tacitus, Annals 15. 43. "O&s;tien&s;es paludes." The &s;hore to the &s;outhward, bor|dering Campania, is called by the &s;ame hi&s;torian, "&s;qualente

To the &s;outhward of Campania were and &s;till are the exten&s;ive mar&s;hes, called "paludes pomptinae," which are &s;o noxious as to create di&s;ea&s;e in a &s;ingle night, and which have cau|&s;ed the Appian way in modern times to be neglected, and the road to Naples to be carried round the mar&s;hes on the ea&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the epitome of the 46th book of Livy, which book is among tho&s;e which are lo&s;t, I find it related that the Pontine Mar&s;hes were drained or dyked [&s;iccatae] and converted into cultivable land, by the Con&s;ul Cornelius Cethegus, about the year of Rome 572. The Ro|mans were convinced that the mar&s;hes were very unwhole&s;ome, and they took incredible pains to render their city and territory healthful, by draining off all &s;tagnant waters.</P>
<P>It is much to be regretted that we have not this book of Livy, to give us further information in what manner the draining of the mar&s;hes was effected. It is con&s;idered by the moderns as impracticable.</P>

<P>The territory next to the city of Rome is de&s;cribed by Livy, b. 7. 38. in the&s;e words "in pe&s;tilente atque arido circa urbem &s;olo"&mdash;a dry plain, but indented with lakes, bordered with mar&s;hes, and &s;ubject to be overflowed by every uncommon ri&s;e of the Tyber, or by &s;treams from the di&s;tant hills. Many epidemic di&s;ea&s;es have been di&s;tinctly traced to &s;tagnant waters on this plain, after an inundation.</P>
<P>Avernus, a lake of Campania, near Baiae, emitted &s;uch a poi&s;onous vapor, that no birds would frequent its banks, and the ancients, in their flights of fancy called it, the road to Hell.</P>
<P>It was this &s;ituation of Rome which gave ri&s;e to the Cloacae, immen&s;e &s;ewers or drains, which penetrated the city and neigh|borhood &mdash;Va&s;t works intended to drain off the &s;tagnant waters; and while the&s;e were pre&s;erved in good repair, the city was obvi|ou&s;ly more healthy.</P>
<P>This plague in the year 290 proved fatal to both of the Con|&s;uls Servilius and Aebutius, to many illu&s;trious Romans, and to a countle&s;s number of the Plebeians. The Senate and people, in de&s;|pair

<P>This violent plague was followed, anno Urb. Con. 292 by a violent earthquake. "Terra ingenti concu&s;&s;a motu e&s;t," &s;ays Li|vy, lib. 3. ca. 10. He expre&s;sly mentions this to have been in the con&s;ulate of P. Volumnius and Serv. Sulpicius, which was the &s;econd Con&s;ulate after the pe&s;tilence. An eruption of Etna is mentioned in the tables under the year of Rome 288, two years before the pe&s;tilence and four years before the earthquake. But there is probably a &s;mall variation in the chronology. The earth|quake was probably at the time of the eruption, e&s;pecially as Li|vy mentions, that in the &s;ame year, "Coelum ardere vi&s;um," the heavens appeared to be in a flame.</P>
<P>Functius places the&s;e events one year later.</P>
<P>By this earthquake Locris, on the gulf of Corinth, was rent from the main land and turned into an i&s;land. Afterwards Lo|cris was de&s;troyed by another earthquake.</P>
<P>Severe drouth marked this period.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 300 according to Livy and the common chronology and B. C. 454, another terrible pe&s;tilence invaded Rome. The country was de&s;olated, and the citizens were ex|hau&s;ted with continual burials. "Urbs a&s;&s;iduis exhau&s;ta funer|ibus." Famin accompanied this calamity, and cattle were vic|tims, as well as men. This plague took place in time of peace &mdash;"ab ho&s;te otium fuit," and in the ab&s;ence of the amba&s;&s;adors who were &s;ent to Athens to collect the laws of Solon and the Grecian in&s;titutions.</P>
<BIBL>Livy b. 3. 32.</BIBL>
<P>With this period corre&s;ponds an eruption of Etna, which au|thors place in the year of Rome 304; of cour&s;e, it was at the clo&s;e of the pe&s;tilential period.</P>
<P>In the year 315 of Rome and B. C. 439, according to Pau|lus Diaconus, tremendous earthquakes &s;hook Italy at intervals for a whole year, &s;o that "a&s;&s;iduis Roma, nuntiis fataga|reter," Rome was fatigued with me&s;&s;engers who were continually arriving with news of towns and villages demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="036687_0041_100A8ADF15E0E420">The chronology of P. Diaconus rarely agrees with that com|monly received. The earthquakes here mentioned probably u&s;hered in the long and formidable calamity which was to follow &mdash;and were probably cotemporary with the beginning of the plague next to be mentioned.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 317, and B. C. 437 commenced a pe&s;|lential &s;tate that afflicted Rome for five years, or five &s;ea&s;ons &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. The hi&s;torian relates that the fir&s;t year "a pe&s;ti|lence invaded the people," and as the di&s;ea&s;e increa&s;ed, prodi|gies alarmed them and frequent earthquakes overturned hou&s;es in the country. The next year the di&s;ea&s;e was more mortal: "pe&s;tilentior inde annus." In 320, the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;o fatal as to &s;u&s;pend all ordinary concerns. The people re&s;orted to their prayers, and the Sybilline books were con&s;ulted and obeyed, to appea&s;e the Gods and avert the plague from the people. For fear of famin, corn was purcha&s;ed in Etruria, the Pontine ter|ritory and in Sicily. The mortality extended al&s;o to cattle. In 321, the di&s;ea&s;e was mitigated and afterwards &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<BIBL>Livy b. 4. 21, 25.</BIBL>
<P>This is the fir&s;t in&s;tance, in which I am able to trace di&s;tinct|ly a <HI>progre&s;&s;ion</HI> in the malignancy of the plague. That this is an important fact, in all plagues, will hereafter appear. But on this point, ancient hi&s;tory affords very &s;canty materials. This was a period of univer&s;al pe&s;tilence for many years, and was marked with all the great phenomena of nature. The la&s;t year of the plague in Rome 321, corre&s;ponds with the year B. C. 433, two years before the plague of Athens. In the year of Rome 325, according to Hook, there was a mo&s;t grievous famin, occa&s;ioned by a &s;evere drouth in all the Roman territory. "Siccitas eo anno plurimum laboratum e&s;t; nec caele&s;tes modo defuerunt aquae, &s;ed terra quoque, ingenito humore egens, vix ad perrennes &s;ubfecit amnes." By this, we are led to believe, that the drouth was not &s;olely cau&s;ed by a want of rain, but by an un|u&s;ual defect of &s;ubterranean &s;prings and moi&s;ture. The expre&s;|&s;ion, "ingenito humore egens," contra&s;ted with the u&s;ual &s;ource of water, rain, evidently carries with it an idea that the evapo|ration from the earth was <HI>unu&s;ual;</HI> and this may ea&s;ily be ac|counted for, by the violent action of internal heat or electricity
<PB N="38" REF="036687_0042_100A8AE2E7AA3490">
which di&s;tingui&s;hed this pe&s;tilential period, and was evidenced by tremendous and univer&s;al earthquakes, and a great eruption of Etna.</P>
<P>The drouth in Rome was extreme&mdash;multitudes of cattle thronged round the arid fountains, and peri&s;hed with thir&s;t. Di&s;ea&s;es followed, fir&s;t invading cattle, and the lower cla&s;&s;es of people and the countrymen, then extending to the city.</P>
<BIBL>Livy b. 4. 30.</BIBL>
<P>Thucydides relates b. 1 and 3, that earthquakes affected the large&s;t part of the globe, and &s;hook it with the utmo&s;t violence. In many places, there was &s;evere drouth and a &s;ub&s;equent famin. In &s;ome places, the earthquakes produced alarming inundations of the &s;ea; as in Euboea and Atalanta&mdash;the Prytaneum, or town-hou&s;e in Athens, the fortifications and &s;ome dwelling-hou&s;es were demoli&s;hed. The&s;e events were in the fifth and &s;ixth years of the Peloponne&s;ian war, an&s;wering to 427 and 426 B. C. and con&s;equently were at the clo&s;e, or &s;ub&s;equent to the pe&s;tilence. About the &s;ame time there was a violent eruption of Etna; &s;uch as had not been known for fifty years preceding. This period was al&s;o marked by the approach of a comet, but I am not clear that it was in the year B. C. 431, as &s;tated by Dr. Prie&s;tley in his Lectures on Hi&s;tory. The drouth was probably within a few months of the appearance of the comet, according to numerous ob&s;ervations in late periods of the world: By which it would &s;eem to be a law of the phy&s;ical &s;y&s;tem, that <HI>pre|ceding, during</HI> and <HI>following</HI> the approach of tho&s;e erratic bodies, this earth is affected alternately with great rains and &s;nows, drouth, violent tempe&s;ts, high tides and earthquakes: Many instances will hereafter occur.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We are &s;ometimes embarra&s;&s;ed with the differences in the chro|nology of different authors. But we have, in this place, data that will fix certain points.</P>
<P>From the uniform operations of nature, there can be very little doubt, that all the great events of the phy&s;ical world, in this period, happened within twelve or eighteen months of each other. The ex|treme drouth in Italy and Greece, mentioned by Livy and Thucydi|des, unque&s;tionably occurred, at both places, in the &s;ame year. Livy places this under the con&s;ul&s;hip of A. Cornelius Co&s;&s;us and T. Quincti|us Pennus, which Hook arranges under the 325th year of Rome, and Lempriere, under the 327th.</P>
<P>Now Thucydides expre&s;sly relates, that the great earthquake which injured Athens, and produced the inundations in the Corinthian Gulf and the Sea of Euboea, rending Atalanta from the main land, and &s;wallowing up a town in Euboea, happened in the &s;pring or &s;ummer of the &s;ixth year of the Peloponne&s;ian war. This war commenced in the &s;econd or third year of the eighty-&s;eventh Olympiad, corre&s;ponding with the years of Rome 323 or 324. The &s;ixth year then will be the 328th or 329th year of Rome. The&s;e data bring the drouth in Rome to one of tho&s;e years; at lea&s;t they will not admit of its being placed earlier than the year 327, the year preceding the earthquake. It is probable therefore that Lempriere is right, in the arrangement of the con&s;uls. This is rendered more probable, by the eruption of Etna, in the &s;pring of the &s;ame year; as it is a known and common fact, that earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes are preceded by exce&s;|&s;ive drouth; owing probably to a gradual increa&s;e of &s;ubterranean heat, or unu&s;ual electrical di&s;charges and evaporation, &s;ome weeks, or months, before the explo&s;ion.</P>
<P>The comet undoubtedly appeared either in the year, preceding, du|ring or following the drouth; that is, in the year of Rome, 327, 328, or 329, corre&s;ponding with year before the Chri&s;tian era, 427, 426, or 425. It was mo&s;t probably in the year of the drouth, and in the fifth year of the war, A. U. C. 327, and B. C. 427; the earthquakes and volcanoe followed in the &s;pring of the next year.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="036687_0043_100AA0AE4534B3E0">The plague in Athens broke out in the &s;econd year of the Peloponne&s;ian war, when all the inhabitants of the Athenian territory, were crouded into the city, to avoid the de&s;tructive ravages of the Lacedemonians. This circum&s;tance alone would account for the production of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es in the city. But it is probable that had the &s;ame event happened in a period of general health, the &s;ickne&s;s in Athens would have been lim|ited to the dy&s;entery, the more violent camp fevers or common typhus.</P>
<P>But unfortunately this war broke out at a time of univer&s;al pe&s;tilence, when the di&s;ea&s;es of the healthie&s;t countries a&s;&s;ume new and more malignant &s;ymptoms, and hence we account for the duration and the violence of the malady. This idea &s;eems to be important, and the only material one to be added to the excellent philo&s;ophical account of the plague at Athens by Dr. Elihu H. Smith, late of New-York. Medical Repo&s;itory, vol. 1, art. 1. The origin of this pe&s;tilence is &s;tated by the hi&s;to|rian to have been in that part of Ethiopia which borders on Egypt; thence extending to Egypt, Lybia, the King's domin|ions or Per&s;ia, and to Greece. Some of the more violent of modern plagues have fir&s;t appeared in the &s;ame region. But we are not to conclude from this de&s;cription that the di&s;ea&s;e is prop|agated by infection from per&s;on to per&s;on. It appears fir&s;t where
<PB N="40" REF="036687_0044_100AA0B0B7732120">
the original or &s;econdary cau&s;es, that is, general and local con|tagion, are the mo&s;t powerful. If the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere over the world, at any one time, is equally vitiated by &s;ome unknown cau&s;e, its effects will fir&s;t appear in places where that &s;tate of air is mo&s;t powerfully aided by <HI>local</HI> vitiation, as in cities or mar&s;hy grounds. Of this we have numerous proofs. But, in modern times, whenever the general contagion, united with local cau&s;es, produces plague in Egypt or Con&s;tantinople, it produces &s;ome milder epidemic in the neighboring countries, and often, its effects are vi&s;ible, at the &s;ame time, in mo&s;t parts of the world.</P>
<P>The Abbe Barthelemy, in his elegant Travels of Anachar&s;is, &s;peaking of the plague in Athens, &s;ays, "it was doubtle&s;s bro't into Greece by a ve&s;&s;el from Egypt." It is to be regretted that &s;uch an accurate and judicious writer &s;hould have indulged <HI>con|jecture</HI> on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject. He quotes no authority for his opinion, and the words of Thucydides oppo&s;e the &s;uppo&s;ition. The di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appeared in the Piraeus, the harbor; and &s;o ignorant were the people of the cau&s;e, that they a&s;cribed it to the poi&s;oning of the wells by the Lacedemonians. Be&s;ides Thucydides impliedly acknowledges that he and others knew nothing of its origin; for he calls on "every one, phy&s;ician or not, to a&s;&s;ign any credible account of its ri&s;e, or the cau&s;es powerful enough to produce it."</P>
<P>Plutarch, in his life of Pericles, &s;ays "the enemies of Pe|ricles, attributed this di&s;a&s;ter to the multitude of people he had collected into the city, during the heat of &s;ummer"&mdash;a charge in which there was much truth.</P>
<P>But when we attend to the violent concu&s;&s;ions of nature, that accompanied and followed the pe&s;tilence, and its general preva|lence in the world for a &s;eries of ten or twelve years, all attempts to trace its origin to infection, dwindle into puerilities; and the occa&s;ional cau&s;es of &s;ickne&s;s, crouded population, heat and bad diet, tho powerful as auxiliaries, could not be adequate to the vi|olent and continued effects in Athens, and the neighboring cities.</P>
<P>The &s;ymptoms of that di&s;ea&s;e in Athens, as de&s;cribed by Thucydides, are known to every medical man. They corre&s;|pond
<PB N="41" REF="036687_0045_100AA0B24600B288">
in all the e&s;&s;ential particulars, with tho&s;e of the Yellow Fever in its wor&s;t forms, and the di&s;ea&s;e was probably what I call the bilious plague. There is the more rea&s;on to believe this &s;uppo&s;ition, as Thucydides has not mentioned, among the &s;ymptoms, the buboes and other &s;wellings of the glands, which di&s;tingui&s;h the inguinal plague. The critical days were the &s;eventh or ninth, as they have mo&s;t frequently been in the bil|ious plague in America.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e extended to other towns in Attica, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e which were mo&s;t populous, but Lacedemon e&s;caped. It raged in Per&s;ia at the &s;ame time, and it is &s;aid, the King of Per&s;ia &s;ent for Hippocrates to lend his aid in arre&s;ting the pro|gre&s;s of the pe&s;tilence, but the latter declined leaving his own country.</P>
<P>It has been &s;uppo&s;ed that Hippocrates was in Athens during this plague; but this mu&s;t be a mi&s;take. He was probably at Tha&s;us, an i&s;land, near the coa&s;t of Macedonia. The four epi|demic years, which he has de&s;cribed, were cotemporary with the pe&s;tilence in Athens; and this proves what will hereafter appear more fully, that in all great plagues, the epidemic or pe&s;tilential principle extends to different countries, and often over the whole earth.</P>
<P>In this pe&s;tilence, as we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve in many &s;ub&s;equent in&s;tances, the birds abandoned the infected at|mo&s;phere.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 341, and B. C. 413, a pe&s;tilence aro&s;e which the hi&s;torian repre&s;ents as more alarming than fatal, "mi|nacior tamen quam pernicio&s;ior." This circum&s;tance affords ground to believe the pe&s;tilence to have been a violent autumnal bilious fever, and not ri&s;ing to the utmo&s;t malignity of the plague.</P>
<P>The pe&s;tilence of that year was <HI>followed</HI> by famin in the next; owing to a neglect of agriculture; the people having been prin|cipally occupied with &s;edition, under their ambitious demagogues. It will be remarked that the famin was not the cau&s;e of the epi|demic, for it &s;ucceeded it.</P>

<P><PB N="42" REF="036687_0046_100AA0B3CD03FC48">It is proper to remark here that all the preceding deadly plagues which had at times almo&s;t de&s;olated Rome, were certainly the produce of the country. The Romans were not a commercial people, nor had they any commercial intercour&s;e with Egypt, till the conque&s;t of Carthage, two centuries and a half after this period. It was not till one hundred and forty &s;even years after the time now under con&s;ideration, that the Romans owned a &s;in|gle &s;hip. When they tran&s;ported troops into Sicily, they hired or borrowed ve&s;&s;els for the purpo&s;e. Egypt was a granary of corn, but until after the conque&s;t of Carthage, the Romans drew their &s;upplies wholly from Italy and Sicily. There is no pre|tence therefore for &s;uppo&s;ing the plague ever imported into Rome; nor is there a &s;ugge&s;tion in hi&s;tory, that its origin was ever a&s;cri|bed to that &s;ource.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 353, and B. C. 401, happened a mo&s;t &s;evere winter. The Tyber was frozen over, and the high-ways rendered impa&s;&s;ible by deep &s;now.

<P>This plague was remarkable for its &s;ymptoms, &s;uch as violent dy&s;enteries, raging fevers, burning entrails, acute pains in every part of the body; and many were &s;eized with madne&s;s, &s;o that they &s;allied forth into the &s;treets, and tore to pieces tho&s;e who fell in their way.</P>
<P>It was during the dry &s;ea&s;on above mentioned that the Lake of Alba ro&s;e &s;uddenly, without apparent cau&s;e, and overflowed its banks&mdash;an event that cau&s;ed great con&s;ternation in Rome, but one that might well happen by a &s;ubterranean di&s;charge of &s;ome water-fountains in the high adjoining hills.</P>
<P>This is one of the in&s;tances which will often occur, of a hard winter, followed by a dry hot &s;ummer, and therefore de&s;erves particular notice; for &s;uch exce&s;&s;es in the temperature of the &s;ea&s;ons are among the cau&s;es of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>A pe&s;tilence broke out in the armies of the Romans and Gauls, while the latter, under Brennus, were be&s;ieging Rome, Anno Romae 361, B. C. 393.

<P>On this occa&s;ion, recour&s;e was had to the ceremony of the Lectisternium,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ceremony con&s;i&s;ted in placing the &s;tatues of Apollo, Latona, Diana, Hercules, Mercury, and Neptune, on three beds, and &s;erving them with magnificent repa&s;ts for eight days&mdash;a mode of checking the pe&s;tilence, about as rational as the modern &s;cheme of confining it to the infected place by bodies of armed men, which is much prai&s;ed by Monte&s;quieu!</NOTE> and to the in&s;titution of new games to appea&s;e the wrath of the Gods, but without &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>P. Oro&s;ius and P. Diaconus, followed by Muratori, place the commencement of this plague in the year of Rome 384. Oro&s;ius &s;ays that "in the 103d and 105th Olympiad, Italy was &s;haken a whole year, by tremendous earthquakes. The hundred and third Olympiad, according to our common chro|nology, comprehends the years of Rome from 386 to 389, in|clu&s;ive. It is probable that is one of the &s;hocks of this &s;eries of earthquakes, the cha&s;m was made in Rome as already related. It will be ob&s;erved that this event <HI>followed</HI> the pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>The comet that appeared, during this calamity, was probably that mentioned by Ari&s;totle, Meteorol. lib. 1. ca. 6, of which he was an eye-witne&s;s.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not omit what authors relate concerning the pe|culiar character of this plague. Oro&s;ius &s;ays, it was not &s;uch a pe&s;tilence, as u&s;ually proceeded from irregular &s;ea&s;ons, extreme drouth, &s;udden heat of the &s;pring, un&s;ea&s;onable moi&s;ture of &s;um|mer and autumn, or the impure air blown from the Calabrian groves; but &s;evere and continued, attacking all de&s;criptions of people, and either de&s;troying their lives, or leaving them in a weak and mi&s;erable condition.</P>
<P>The winter when the comet appeared Ari&s;totle relates to have been cold; but the &s;everity and duration of the plague cannot be accounted for on the principle of changes or irregularities in the &s;ea&s;ons.

<P>Some of the&s;e phenomena, exce&s;&s;ive rains and drouth, tem|pe&s;ts, cele&s;tial lights, and &s;ingular appearances of the &s;un, al|ways attend the approach of comets; and it is &s;urpri&s;ing that the moderns have taken little or no notice of the fact.</P>
<P>The cata&s;trophe of Helice and Bura was occa&s;ioned by vio|lent &s;hocks of earthquakes, with contrary and conflicting winds, which &s;welled the water in the Corinthian gulf, above the tops of trees on the &s;hore.

<P>&rindx; After writing the foregoing, I found in Pliny, Nat. Hi&s;t. lib. 2. 25, an account of a comet in "the hundred and eighth Olympiad, and year of Rome 398." It re&s;embled at fir&s;t a cre&s;t, but changed into the form of a &s;pear. Now, the fir&s;t year of the 108th Olympiad, according to common chro|nology, corre&s;ponds with the year of Rome 406. There is therefore a difference between the common mode of reckoning by the Olympiads, and Pliny's mode, of at lea&s;t eight years or two Olympiads.&mdash;By following the common mode, and placing the fir&s;t year of the 108th Olympiad, again&s;t the 406th year of Rome, the appearance of this comet will coincide with the gen|eral tenor of facts, hereafter to be related, and corre&s;pond nearly in time with the plague in Rome, mentioned above.</P>
<P>Nearly at the &s;ame time, there was an eruption of Etna, placed by authors in the year B. C. 350, corre&s;ponding with the year of Rome 404. It is probable this eruption was within a year or two of the appearance of the comet; according to many modern facts of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 422, a violent plague aro&s;e, which, &s;ays P.

<P>This plague commenced with many alarming prodigies, and violent tempe&s;ts. A remarkable cloud and extreme darkne&s;s, for the greater part of a day, is mentioned by Livy, under fa|vor of which the Samnites attacked the Roman lines.

<P>The violence and duration of this plague induced the Romans to &s;end to Epidaurus for E&s;culapius, which they imported in form of a &s;erpent, and in the i&s;land of the Tyber, where it was fir&s;t landed, they con&s;ecrated a temple to the God of Phy&s;ic.</P>

<P>In the year of Rome 482, a pe&s;tilence broke out in Rome, and raged two or three years, carrying off countle&s;s multitudes of people. This was preceded by an eruption of fire at Calenum, which continued for three days and nights, de&s;troying the &s;oil for a con&s;iderable extent. This period al&s;o was di&s;tingui&s;hed by earthquakes, in the third year of the pe&s;tilence.</P>

<P>It will be found as we proceed with this hi&s;tory, that mo&s;t of &s;uch extraordinary &s;ea&s;ons and unu&s;ual concurrence of great agi|tations in nature, happen during volcanic eruptions and the ap|proach of comets to the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem of which this globe is a part.

<P>In the year of Rome 529 and B. C. 225, the Roman armies which were marching into Gaul, were retarded by violent rains, and the plague which infected the &s;oldiers.

<P>Some of the prodigies, mentioned by Roman hi&s;torians, and which have been ridiculed by moderns who are too wi&s;e to &s;tudy the operations of nature, aad too proud to believe in extraordina|ry occurrences, will be hereafter explained.</P>
<P>During the battle near the Lake Thra&s;amene, a &s;evere earth|quake was experienced, which, it is &s;aid, the armies did not perceive. Pliny Nat. Hi&s;t. lib. 2. 84. This was in the year of Rome 536, and B. C. 218; in which year, Livy relates, b. 21. 61, there was a &s;evere winter. Scipio was be&s;ieging a town in Spain, near the pre&s;ent Barcelona&punc; and for thirty days, the &s;now was four feet deep. This is mentioned as a circum|&s;tance very unfavorable for the be&s;iegers. I cannot help re|marking how clo&s;ely connected in time are great fro&s;ts and vio|lent earthquakes. This was the winter in which Hannibal cro&s;|&s;ed the Alps and entered Italy. He reached the Alps early in November and was nine days in arriving to the &s;ummit. His ar|my &s;uffered incredible hard&s;hips and lo&s;&s;es from deep &s;now, bad roads, and the natives who killed many of the troops. At the end of fifteen days, he gave his troops re&s;t, on the hills near the foot of the Alps, and altho the &s;now was deep on the mountains, he found in the vales, pa&s;turage for his hor&s;es and elephants. He pro&s;ecuted his route in the winter, &s;uffering great hard&s;hips from &s;now, and more from rains, which &s;welled the rivers. Early in the &s;pring he cro&s;&s;ed the Appenine, and here his troops again &s;uf|fered from a &s;now &s;torm.</P>

<P>At the &s;iege of Syracu&s;e by Marcellus in the year of Rome 541 and B. C. 213, happened a remarkable mortality, among the troops, but e&s;pecially among the Cathaginians, who all peri&s;hed with their Generals, Hippocrates and Himilco. Of this pe&s;ti|lence,
<PB N="51" REF="036687_0055_100AA0DA1004C4E0">
Livy gives the following account, b. 25. 26. "A pe&s;tilence broke out in both armies, which diverted their minds from the concerns of the war; for it was in autumn, and in a &s;it|uation naturally unhealthy. The heat, which was more &s;evere without the city than within, affected almo&s;t every per&s;on in both the camps. At fir&s;t, per&s;ons &s;ickened and died, by rea&s;on of the unwhole&s;omene&s;s of the place; afterwards the di&s;ea&s;es &s;pread by infection, &s;o that tho&s;e who were &s;eized, were neglected, or aban|doned and died, or their attendants contracted the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e. Daily burials and death were before their eyes, and day and night their ears were a&s;&s;ailed with lamentations. At length the &s;urvi|vors became hardened; they neither grieved at the death of oth|ers, nor took pains to bury the dead; and the bodies of the de|cea&s;ed lay &s;cattered along the &s;treets, in &s;ight of tho&s;e who were expecting the &s;ame fate. The dead infected the &s;ick, and the &s;ick, tho&s;e in health, with terror and pe&s;tiferous &s;tench; and &s;ome, preferring death by the &s;word, ru&s;hed on the po&s;ts of the enemy.</P>
<P>But the di&s;ea&s;e was much more &s;evere and fatal to the Cartha|ginians, than to the Romans, who, in this long &s;iege, had be|come accu&s;tomed to the air and water. The Sicilian troops, on the fir&s;t breaking out of the di&s;ea&s;e, abandoned their allies, and returned to their homes. The Carthaginians, who had no means of &s;helter, all peri&s;hed. Marcellus, to avoid the evil, drew his troops into the city, where their enfeebled bodies were refre&s;hed by the &s;hades of the hou&s;es. Many however of the Roman ar|my, died of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e."</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable that heat and po&s;ition augmented the di&s;ea&s;e among the Carthaginians. They were encamped near a mar&s;h or low ground; and expo&s;ed to the direct rays of a burning &s;un. The Romans had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one part of Syracu&s;e, and had &s;helter under the buildings. The&s;e circum&s;tances, and their not being accu&s;tomed to the air of the place, proved fatal to the whole Cathaginian army. Mr. Brydone learnt in Sicily from the hi&s;to|riographer of Etna, Recupero, that there was a great eruption of Etna, during this &s;iege of Syracu&s;e. I have not met with an ac|count of it in the original hi&s;tories I have con&s;ulted.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="036687_0056_100AA0DD254BE1D0">In the &s;ame year, that this pe&s;tilence raged in Syracu&s;e, a &s;e|vere pe&s;tilential epidemic prevailed in Rome. "Eo anno pe&s;ti|lentia gravis incidit in urbem, agro&s;que; quae tamen magis in lon|gos morbos, quam in perniciales, eva&s;it."</P>
<BIBL>Livy, 27. 23.</BIBL>
<P>This fact is evidence of what will be fully proved in later peri|ods of the world, that a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air extends, at the &s;ame time, over many parts of the world; and that if a violent plague is raging in one place, malignant di&s;ea&s;es, if not plague, prevail in other places.</P>
<P>Another important fact related in the la&s;t quotation, is that the pe&s;tilence in Rome was the bilious plague, as it was not &s;o mortal, as it was trouble&s;ome, by running out into long di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>It is a known fact and not unfrequent, that the Yellow Fever, in our climate, is reduceable to a bilious remittent and even to an intermittent; the pe&s;tilence on board the &s;hips at Bulama of|ten ran out into long and ob&s;tinate intermittents. The fever in Baltimore in 1797 began in the form of a bilious remittent, and continued in that form for many weeks, before it a&s;&s;umed the &s;ymptoms of a malignant Yellow Fever.</P>
<P>The Roman and Carthaginian armies in Bruttium, a town in the &s;outhern part of the Kingdom of Naples, &s;uffered greatly by a pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e, in the year of Rome 548; but no particu|lars worthy of notice are recorded.</P>
<BIBL>Livy, b. 28. 46</BIBL>
<P>It is however to be remarked that this period of pe&s;tilence was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appearance of immen&s;e &s;warms of locu&s;ts, which over&s;pread the whole country about Capua. Their appear|ance was &s;ub&s;equent to the plague mentioned in the armies. We &s;hall have frequent occa&s;ion to mention the &s;ame phenomenon in the natural world, as cotemporary with pe&s;tilence. But clouds of the&s;e animals rarely or never appear at any other time, than during or near the time of the prevalence of plagues; and by comparing the dates of their appearance, it will be found, that they are not, unle&s;s by accident, the cau&s;e of plague, nor the effect; but, like other animals which are generated in myriads, during pe&s;tilence, the produce of &s;ome general cau&s;e, and probably of that &s;tate of the elements, which occa&s;ions the di&s;ea&s;es of the human race.</P>
<BIBL>Livy, 30. 2.</BIBL>
<P><PB N="53" REF="036687_0057_100AA0DF498DCD00">During the war between the Romans and Antiochus, king of Syria, in 563, an event took place, &s;imilar to many in&s;tances rela|ted by Dr. Lind. The Roman fleet, with that of the Rhodi|ans, in &s;earch of the Syrian fleet, put into the gulph of Pam|phylia and anchored at Pha&s;elis. But it was in the mid&s;t of &s;um|mer, and the place unwhole&s;ome; and the men, unaccu&s;tomed to the air, were &s;eized with a pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e, e&s;pecially the rowers. Why the rowers? evidently becau&s;e they were more ex|po&s;ed to a hot &s;un, to the air and to fatigue, than the troops on board. This &s;ickne&s;s induced the commander to quit that &s;tation, and we hear no more of the epidemic.</P>
<BIBL>Livy, b. 37. 23.</BIBL>
<P>In the year of Rome 571 and B. C. 182 commenced a violent plague, which la&s;ted &s;everal years, and ravaged Rome and all It|aly &s;o that the Romans could not enli&s;t 8000 &s;oldiers to quell a revolt. In the next year, Livy mentions a drouth of &s;ix months, and a con&s;equent dearth of corn.</P>
<P>It will be remarked by any man who reads hi&s;tory with atten|tion, that during pe&s;tilential periods, all the ordinary operations of nature acquire unu&s;ual &s;trength and magnitude. Earthquakes and tempe&s;ts are va&s;tly more violent, than at other times. The an|cient hi&s;torians, evidently without de&s;ign, have left proofs of this fact. Thus Livy mentions, that during the period under con&s;ide|ration, the operations of the war in Spain ware retarded by con|tinual rains, which &s;welled the rivers, and Flaccus, the Praetor, was compelled, tempe&s;tatibus foedis, terrible storms, to order his whole army into a city in the neighborhood.</P>
<BIBL>Livy, b. 40. 33. and &s;ec. 29. 36.</BIBL>
<P>The &s;pring of the year 571 was remarkably tempe&s;tuous, and Livy gives a frightful account of a &s;torm in Rome which did no &s;mall injury to the public buildings.</P>
<BIBL>B. 40. 2.</BIBL>
<P>Short has placed this pe&s;tilence in the year of the world 3763, corre&s;ponding according to U&s;her with the year of Rome 507. But Short's chronology is wretched. He mentions a large comet &s;ix years after this period, of the &s;ize of the &s;un and of a fiery color. Of the appearance of a comet at the period under con|&s;ideration, there can be no doubt, tho I have not found the origin|al
<PB N="54" REF="036687_0058_100AA0E19608BB58">
writer who mentions it and Short quotes no authority but Pozel. He however has made an egregious blunder in the time, as he has in many other in&s;tances of facts which he relates, of high an|tiquity.</P>
<P>The order of the great phenomena of nature &s;eems to be that violent &s;torms, rain and a cold winter, are followed the next year with exce&s;&s;ive heat and drouth and vice ver&s;a. Violent &s;torms however occur at all times during the&s;e periods. It will be noted, that the pe&s;tilence above mentioned could not be occa&s;ioned by the drouth and dearth of corn, for it broke out in the year preceding. The &s;ame fact often occurs, and proves that great pe&s;tilence is not &s;olely the effect of intemperate &s;ea&s;ons, but that both are the ef|fects of another cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent in&s;tance is one, in which a mo&s;t &s;evere winter fol|lowed the other unu&s;ual &s;ea&s;ons. In the year 574, according to Hook, and the con&s;ul&s;hip of Q. Fulvius and L. Manlius, the winter was remarkable for deep &s;now and every kind of tempe&s;t. It continued longer than u&s;ual, and trees, expo&s;ed to the weath|er, were bla&s;ted. An earthquake happened, in the following year.</P>
<BIBL>Livy, b. 40. 45. 59.</BIBL>
<P>This then fixes the year of the appearance of the comet, mentioned by Short. That he refers to the &s;ame period is cer|tain from his mentioning the circum&s;tance of the inability of the Roman &s;enate to rai&s;e a body of 8000 men; a fact a&s;&s;igned by Hook to the year 571, and which can belong to no other period. But from his de&s;cription of this &s;tar, I am inclined to believe he refers to that which is hereafter mentioned, under the great pe&s;ti|lence of 610, and which Pliny has well de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>This uncommon &s;ea&s;on was &s;ucceeded in 576 by pe&s;tilence among cattle, and the next year, followed the plague, which made dreadful havoc in Rome. Some facts &s;tated by the hi&s;to|rian de&s;erve particular notice. "Pe&s;tilentia, quae priore anno in boves ingruerat, eo verteret in hominum morbos.

<BIBL>Livy b. 41. 21.</BIBL>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to do ju&s;tice to this energetic de&s;cription of the hi&s;torian, but the following is the &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age. "The pe&s;|tilence which had affected cattle in the former year, now turned into di&s;ea&s;es of men. Tho&s;e who were &s;eized &s;carcely lived be|yond the &s;eventh day; tho&s;e who &s;urvived that day, were afflict|ed with tedious di&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pers, e&s;pecially the quartan ague. The di&s;ea&s;e made its mo&s;t fatal ravages among the &s;laves, who&s;e dead bodies lay unburied along the highways. It was not po&s;&s;ible to bury the bodies of the free citizens. Their corp&s;es lay unburied, untouched by dogs and vultures, and wa&s;ted away by corruption. It was evident that in this and the former year, during the great mortality among men and cattle, no vulture was &s;een."</P>
<P>In this account, the following particulars are noticeable.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That the pe&s;tilential air fir&s;t produced its effects on cattle.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That the <HI>&s;eventh</HI> was the critical day&mdash;as it u&s;ually is, in modern bilious plague.</P>
<P N="3">3d. That if the di&s;ea&s;e had a favorable cri&s;is on the &s;eventh day, the patient &s;urvived, but the di&s;temper changed into an au|tumnal bilious fever of the quartan type, and long duration&mdash;a &s;trong evidence of what I have before remarked that, if pe&s;tis and pe&s;tilentia are di&s;ea&s;es of a di&s;tinct &s;pecies, the Roman pe&s;tilence was the bilious plague.</P>
<P N="4">4th. This pe&s;tilence was, as u&s;ual, mo&s;t mortal among the lower orders of people.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Carnivorous animals would not touch the dead bodies, and vultures de&s;erted the atmo&s;phere of Rome.</P>
<P>The la&s;t fact is common in <HI>great</HI> plagues; but in plagues of a le&s;s malignancy, animals do not quit the infected places. The&s;e facts &s;eem to indicate that birds perceive the pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air, before it becomes &s;en&s;ible to the human &s;pecies. It &s;eems that the vultures di&s;appeared, the fir&s;t year, while the pe&s;tilence was confined to cattle; and there can be little doubt, that the del|icate organs of fowls perceive the derangement of the air, whether
<PB N="56" REF="036687_0060_100AA0E4C3589910">
the cau&s;e may be, the infu&s;ion into it of a pe&s;tiferous vapor, of the ab&s;traction from it of a portion of the vital principle, before its effects are vi&s;ible in larger animals, and before the air is ren|dered offen&s;ive by the carca&s;es of di&s;ea&s;ed and dead animals.</P>
<P>This was one of tho&s;e violent and long continued plagues of which hi&s;tory has recorded many in&s;tances; and the Romans on this occa&s;ion, &s;aw many prodigies. It is difficult, in &s;ome ca|&s;es, to di&s;tingui&s;h, in the relations of hi&s;torians, truth from vul|gar report; and philo&s;ophy mu&s;t guard again&s;t the illu&s;ions of credulity and terrified imaginations. I take no notice of the mon&s;ters born, and an ox's &s;peaking, on the&s;e occa&s;ions. At the beginning of the late American war, many &s;imilar prodigies were announced and believed by the ignorant and credulous. But &s;ome of the phenomena, enumerated by Livy among prod|igies, in all probability, had a real exi&s;tence, for it will be re|lated hereafter that &s;imilar appearances have been ob&s;erved, in modern times, during pe&s;tilence, and appear evidently to have a connection with its cau&s;es.</P>
<P>During the plague above mentioned, a bow was &s;een in the &s;ky, in a &s;erene day, extended over the temple of Saturn in the Roman forum; three &s;uns or haloes appeared, and at night many torches, or meteors de&s;cended in Lanuvium. There is &s;trong evidence for believing the&s;e phenomena to be occa&s;ioned by a vapor emitted from the earth, in &s;uperabundant quantities, and which there is rea&s;on to think, may be the cau&s;e of pe&s;tilen|tial di&s;ea&s;es; or there may be &s;ome changes in the combination of &s;ub&s;tances compo&s;ing the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of this pe&s;tilential period, in 581, Apulia was deluged by &s;warms of locu&s;ts; as the Pontine territory had been the year before. So de&s;tructive were their ravages, that the Praetor Sicinius was &s;ent with an army to drive them away.</P>
<BIBL>Livy, b. 42. 2 &amp; 10.</BIBL>
<P>Oro&s;ius b. 4 relates, that a mo&s;t violent plague de&s;olated Rome in the year 610 and B. C. 144. The dead bodies lay pu|trefying in the hou&s;es and &s;treets, and rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to approach the city. In the preceding year appeared a remarkable comet. As we come down to the more authentic periods of hi&s;|tory, this phenomenon will more frequently occur.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="036687_0061_100AA0E9E05D08C0">It is again nece&s;&s;ary to remark a difference in the chronology of different authors. Seneca places the appearance of this comet, which he de&s;cribes to have been as large and luminous as the &s;un, "Po&s;t mortem Demetrii Syriae Regis, paulo ante Achaicum Bellum"&mdash;after the death of Demetrius, king of Syria, and a little before the Achean war.</P>
<BIBL>Nat. Que&s;t. lib. 7. 15.</BIBL>
<P>Demetrius was &s;lain, B. C. 151, according to common chro|nology, and the Achean war was in the year when Carthage was taken and de&s;troyed by Scipio, B. C. 146. The appearance of the comet therefore &s;hould be placed in the year preceding, or 147, corre&s;ponding with the year of Rome, 607. And this is proba|bly correct, for it is agreeable to general ob&s;ervation, that a comet appears early in the pe&s;tilential period, and often <HI>precedes</HI> its mo&s;t calamitous years.&mdash;The Encyclopedia a&s;&s;igns it to the year 146.</P>
<P>Seneca remarks that at fir&s;t it appeared fiery and red, emitting a bright light, &s;o as to overcome the darkne&s;s of the night. Gradually its magnitude le&s;&s;ened and its brightne&s;s vani&s;hed.</P>

<P>In the year of Rome 628, and B. C. 126, hi&s;torians relate, that a mo&s;t dreadful pe&s;tilence aro&s;e in Africa, from dead lo|cu&s;ts. The&s;e animals were brought towards Numidia and Utica, by a &s;trong ea&s;t wind, in &s;uch innumerable multitudes, that they devoured every green thing&mdash;not &s;paring even the bark of trees. They were driven by the &s;outh wind into the Mediterranean, and being wa&s;hed on &s;hore, in the hot &s;ea&s;on, they putrefied, and cau&s;ed a mo&s;t deadly plague. It is related that 800,000 per&s;ons peri&s;hed in Numidia alone; 200,000 on the &s;ea coa&s;t of Carthage and Utica, and 30,000 of the Roman troops. No le&s;s than 1500 dead bodies were carried out of one gate of U|tica, in a &s;ingle day.</P>

He remarks further that, altho locu&s;ts had often appeared in his days, in great numbers, yet they never be|fore had done more mi&s;chief when dead, than when living, &s;o as to cau&s;e mankind to wi&s;h they had not peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t accede to the opinion of the ancients that the &s;tench of the locu&s;ts was one cau&s;e of the pe&s;tilence; it is po&s;&s;ible that no epidemic di&s;ea&s;e would have been excited without that cau&s;e; but it is equally true, that in a healthy &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, no putrefaction of dead bodies has ever been known to produce an epidemic pe&s;tilence. It may be powerful enough to excite di&s;ea&s;e within a &s;mall extent of its own atmo&s;phere; but if no other cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;ts, it will not extend beyond that in|fected atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>The appearance of immen&s;e multitudes of locu&s;ts, during pe&s;tilence, is a curious fact in natural hi&s;tory, and well de&s;erves inve&s;tigation; but the&s;e animals do not always <HI>precede</HI> the ap|pearance of the di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;ame period, nor do they often peri&s;h in &s;uch collections as to be the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. The common idea in Arabia, is, that they are generated by heat and drouth. Cold and rains are &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;troy their eggs.</P>
<P>About the beginning of this de&s;tructive period, appeared a comet. The Encyclopedia mentions <HI>two,</HI> in the year of Rome 629, and B. C. 125. But it is probable this is a mi&s;take of the compilers. The univer&s;al hi&s;tory places one under the year 630, and a &s;econd under the following year, quoting Ju&s;tin, for au|thority. But Ju&s;tin mentions two comets, one at the birth of Mithridates, another in the year he began to reign. Now Mi|thridates was about eleven or twelve years old when he came to
<PB N="59" REF="036687_0063_100AA0ECF17A9C58">
the throne, in the year of Rome 631, and B. C. 123. Of cour&s;e the fir&s;t comet mu&s;t have been about the year 620, and B. C. 134.</P>
<P>It is no incon&s;iderable proof of the truth of Ju&s;tin's account, and of the accuracy of our chronology in this particular, that there was an eruption of the great volcano of Sicily, in both the pe|riods when the&s;e comets are &s;aid to have appeared. In the year 620, and B. C. 134, there was an eruption of Etna, tho not mentioned by Ju&s;tin; and this was the year of the fir&s;t great comet, and of the birth of Mithridates. Nine years after, in 629, there was a &s;econd eruption of Etna. The la&s;t year cor|re&s;ponds nearly with the period in which Mithridates began to reign, allowing him to be eleven years old, and with the ap|proach of the &s;econd comet.</P>
<P>This la&s;t comet produced mo&s;t tremendous effects, as we might expect from its magnitude, and proximity to the earth. The following is Ju&s;tin's de&s;cription of it. "Nam et eo quo genitus e&s;t anno, et eo quo regnare primum coepit, &s;tella cometes, per utrumque tempus, 70 diebus ita luxit, ut coelum omne fla|grare videreter." For 70 days the heavens appeared to be in a flame.</P>

<P>In Paulus Diaconus we have a relation of &s;ingular facts in re|gard to the eruption of Etna. Globes of fire were thrown from the Crater. Lipari, a &s;mall volcanic i&s;land on the north of Si|cily, became &s;o heated, during the eruption, that the rocks were di&s;&s;olved, tho it is not &s;aid that this i&s;land di&s;charged any fire. The water of the neighboring &s;ea was &s;o heated as to kill the fi&s;h, and melt the pitch on the decks of ve&s;&s;els. Dead fi&s;h ap|peared on the &s;urface of the water, and many per&s;ons, who were near the i&s;land, were &s;uffocated with heat.</P>

1680, who&s;e period is calculated to be 575 years. If this is its period, it mu&s;t have been &s;een in the year B. C. 1767, in the reign of Ogyges, when Attica was inundated and rendered barren for a number of years; and when the planet Venus is &s;aid to have changed her figure, color and cour&s;e. When we &s;urvey the uniform effects of comets in tempe&s;ts and floods, and compare the traditional account of that event with the terrible inundations which have happened in Greece at other times, and e&s;pecially with that in the time of Thucydides, which rent Ata|lanta from the main land; which events all took place during the approach of comets; we are con&s;trained to believe the fact of the Ogygean deluge, and fable ri&s;es to the dignity of authentic hi&s;tory. This inundation might have happened during the approach of &s;ome other comet, but the probability is, that it was during that of the comet under con&s;ideration, which fixes the time of the Ogygean flood, in the year B. C. 1767. This circum|&s;tance may &s;erve to correct the chronology of the early events in Greece.</P>

<P>Its next appearance mu&s;t have been in the year A. C. 1193, when Electra, one of the pleiads, abandoned her &s;i&s;ter orbs, and fled from the Zodiac to the north pole.</P>
<P>Its third appearance corre&s;ponds with the year A. C. 618, the year of the terrible comet of the Sybill, &s;ays Gibbon; and its fourth, is the one under con&s;ideration.

All the periods here named, which come within the limits of authentic hi&s;tory, have been remarkable for pe&s;tilence, earth|quakes, inundations or other great phenomena.

<P>But another phenomenon, the palene&s;s or defect of light, in the &s;un, de&s;erves more particular attention. Pliny a&s;&s;erts that this pale color la&s;ted almo&s;t a year. His words are, "Fiunt prodigio&s;i et longiores &s;olis defectus, qualis occi&s;o dictatore Cae|&s;are

<P>The words <HI>ferrugo</HI> and <HI>luridus</HI> give us an exact idea of the color&mdash;a palene&s;s tinctured with the color of ru&s;t. A &s;imilar defect of light in the &s;un occurred at the time of the next ap|pearance of this comet, A. D. 531, as will be hereafter related. The fact is curious. It is well known that this comet ap|proaches very near to the &s;un; but whether the defect of &s;plen|dor in the &s;un was the effect of the attractive powers of the comet, or of an alteration in the electrical atmo&s;phere of the&s;e bodies; or whether it was occa&s;ioned by an alteration in the ter|re&s;trial atmo&s;phere, is a que&s;tion not ea&s;ily &s;olved.

Horace, the Poet, his friend and flatterer, endeavored to di&s;&s;uade him from this purpo&s;e, on account of the prodigies which happened at the beginning of the year, which was the winter of the year 30 B. C. and corre&s;ponds exactly with the appearance of the comet.

<PB N="64" REF="036687_0068_100AA0F7F540FEE0">

<P>In the 21&s;t ode of the &s;ame book, Horace addre&s;&s;es Apollo who "drives war, famin and pe&s;tilence from the Roman people and the Emperor, to the Per&s;ians and Britons."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. Hi&s;torical view of pe&s;tilential epidemics from the Chri&s;tian era, to the year 1347.</HEAD>
<P>AT the clo&s;e of the reign of Augu&s;tus, about the year 14 or according to &s;ome authors 16 of the Chri&s;tian era, there was a great famin in Rome, and a comet is mentioned, near the &s;ame time, by Dion Ca&s;&s;ius. This was followed by a mo&s;t terrible pe&s;tilence in the ea&s;t, during which twelve cities of A&s;ia Minor were overthrown by earthquakes. Of the&s;e ca|lamitous events, the following is the account recorded by Taci|tus, An. lib. 2. 47. "Eodem anno, duodecem celebres A&s;iae urb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s conlap&s;ae nocturno motu terrae, quo improvi&s;ior gravior|que pe&s;tis fuit.

<P>The clo&s;e of the reign of Claudius and the beginning of the reign of Nero, A. D. 53 and 4, were marked by a &s;imilar train of phenomena and calamities. A comet is noted by Sue|tonius and Pliny about the year 54, the year in which Claudius was poi&s;oned. Tacitus relates that people were alarmed by fre|quent &s;hocks of earthquakes, which demoli&s;hed many buildings, and great dearth of corn prevailed in Rome and Greece. Pliny records that thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;uns, by which are doubtle&s;s intended, halos or mock &s;uns, appeared the &s;ame year.

<P>This period was &s;ickly, tho not recorded as pe&s;tilential. Su|etonius remarks, "Ex omnium Magi&s;tratum generi, plerique mortem obierant." Many of all kinds of public officers died; by which we infer that the year was &s;ickly.</P>
<P>In the reign of Nero occurred the next pe&s;tilential period. Two comets are noted, one A. D. 62 and a &s;econd in 66. In the year 62, Laodicea was overwhelmed by an earthquake. In the year 68, occurred a mo&s;t violent tempe&s;t in Campania which de&s;troyed villages, trees and grain; and a violent earthquake. At the &s;ame time, raged a mortal plague in Rome, which is &s;aid to have carried off 30,000 people; but by the de&s;cription of its
<PB N="67" REF="036687_0071_100AA0FFDF7FCFF0">
ravages, it is probable the number was much greater. Tacitus remarks that the "hou&s;es were filled with dead bodies and the &s;treets with funerals; neither age nor &s;ex was exempt; &s;laves and ingenuous plebeians were &s;uddenly taken off, amid&s;t the la|mentations of their wives and children, who, while they a&s;&s;i&s;ted the &s;ick, or mourned over the dead, were &s;eized with the di&s;ea&s;e, and peri&s;hing, were burnt on the &s;ame funeral pile. To the knights and &s;enators, the di&s;ea&s;e was le&s;s mortal, tho the&s;e al&s;o &s;uffered in the common calamity."</P>
<P>As Rome, at the time under con&s;ideration, contained more than a million of inhabitants, &s;o mortal a plague mu&s;t have ex|tingui&s;hed a much larger number than 30,000 people&mdash;it is not improbable, a numeral or figure has been omitted by the tran&s;|cribers of the original hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The earthquakes of this period were experienced in A&s;ia Mi|nor, at Laodicea and Hierapolis.</P>
<P>Seneca mentions that a flock of 600 &s;heep were killed by the pe&s;tiferous vapor, di&s;charged during the earthquake in Italy.</P>
<P>Dion Ca&s;&s;ius relates, that at this period, a mo&s;t formidable in|undation laid wa&s;te the Egyptian coa&s;t.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be omitted that the violent tempe&s;t in which St. Paul was &s;hipwrecked on the i&s;land of Melita, now Malta, was in the year 61 or 62, during the approach of the fir&s;t comet.</P>
<P>Tacitus remarks, that no vi&s;ible cau&s;e could be a&s;&s;igned for the pe&s;tilence of this period; "Nulla Coeli intemperie quae occur|reret occulis." No remarkable &s;ea&s;on had occurred, to which this di&s;temper could be a&s;cribed. We &s;hall find, in &s;ub&s;equent periods, di&s;tingui&s;hed writers making &s;imilar remarks. The rea|&s;on is, the&s;e authors did not take a view &s;ufficiently comprehen|&s;ive of the operations of nature; and if the cau&s;e of plague could not be found, <HI>very near in time and place,</HI> they did not ob&s;erve it. It is true, that an extraordinary &s;ea&s;on does not always precede or attend pe&s;tilence, in a particular place; but by extending our view of the &s;ubject, to general cau&s;es, operating over whole quar|ters of the globe, and perhaps over the whole globe; and con|&s;idering the cau&s;es, as invi&s;ible, and acting for a &s;eries of years,

<P>Seneca places the great earthquake in Campania under the Con&s;ul&s;hip of Regulus and Virginius, which, according to com|mon chronology, was in the 65th year of the Chri&s;tian era.</P>
<P>The next pe&s;tilential period is one of the mo&s;t remarkable in all the circum&s;tances, that is recorded in Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>In the year 79 [&s;ome authors &s;ay a year later, but the diffe|rence is of no moment, as they agree in the <HI>order</HI> of the events related] ju&s;t before the death of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, appeared a comet with a long coma in the month of June. On the fir&s;t of Novem|ber following, a mo&s;t tremendous ebullition of fire and lava i&s;&s;u|ed from Ve&s;uvius and laid wa&s;te the neighboring country. At the &s;ame time, happened a violent earthquake, which buried the cities of Herculaneum and Pompeium; and &s;o &s;udden was the &s;hock, that the people, who were attending a play, had not time to quit the theater, and were all buried in a ma&s;s.</P>
<P>This dreadful cata&s;trophe was preceded by rumbling noi&s;es in the earth, and the earth was heated to a great degree. Violent agitations of the &s;ea, thunder and lightning al&s;o announced the approach of &s;ome dreadful event.</P>
<P>The eruption la&s;ted three days, during which time &s;uch im|men&s;e quantities of a&s;hes and &s;moke were di&s;charged, that day was turned into night, and the a&s;hes were driven by different winds to Rome, Syria and Africa.</P>
<P>The agitations of the earth and the elements were tremendous and frighful. Baronius remarks, that &s;ome per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed the world would be reduced to chaos, or con&s;umed with fire. The fi&s;h in the neighboring &s;eas were de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>This explo&s;ion of &s;ubterranean fire was <HI>preceded</HI> by a &s;evere drouth in Italy. The next year, 80, was remarkable for a terri|ble inundation in England; the Severn overflowing a large tract of country, and de&s;troying multitudes of cattle.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="036687_0073_100AA105C963B790">The&s;e violent effects of &s;ubterranean fire were attended by one of the mo&s;t fatal plagues recorded in hi&s;tory. A remark of Dion is here very important. He &s;ays that the "A&s;hes from Ve&s;uvi|us cau&s;ed, at the time, only &s;light indi&s;po&s;itions or di&s;ea&s;es; but afterwards produced an Epidemic di&s;temper," The remark is incorrect, in a&s;cribing even &s;light di&s;ea&s;es to a&s;hes; but it leads to a conclu&s;ion, which is of moment. The &s;light complaints which prevailed in the autumn of the year of the eruption, com|pared with modern ob&s;ervations, appear to have been the <HI>precur|&s;ors</HI> of the plague, which broke out the next year, and as au|thors a&s;&s;ert, de&s;troyed, for &s;ome time, 10,000 citizens of Rome in a day.&mdash;The &s;ame year, while the Emperor Titus was view|ing the ruins in Campania, a fire broke out in the city, which laid in a&s;hes a great number of buildings.</P>
<P>The order of the events in this period was, a comet, drouth, &s;light di&s;ea&s;es, and an eruption of Ve&s;uvius, with the earth|quakes, the fir&s;t year.&mdash;In the &s;econd, appeared the pe&s;tilence with its mo&s;t malignant effects.</P>
<P>In this eruption of Ve&s;uvius, the fir&s;t recorded in hi&s;tory, per|i&s;hed the elder Pliny; and the Emperor Titus fell a victim to his paternal care of his &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>In the year 107 four cities of A&s;ia, two in Greece and three in Galatia, were overwhelmed by an earthquake. A comet is mentioned by Short in 109&punc; but as I have not found the original authority, I cannot depend on the accuracy of the chronology. It is probable that the&s;e phenomena occurred within the &s;ame year; and there is the more rea&s;on to believe this, as different and re&s;pectable authors differ two or three years in the chronology of Roman hi&s;tory. The next event to be related, is a re|markable in&s;tance of the truth of this ob&s;ervation.</P>

<P>In the reign of Trajan, the city of Antioch was almo&s;t to|tally demolished by an earthquake. This emperor was in the city at the time, and narrowly e&s;caped with his life. Some au|thors place this event in the year 114; others in 115; but Ba|ronius has proved by an ancient in&s;cription, that it happened under the con&s;ulate of P. Vip&s;tanus Me&s;&s;ala and M. Virgilianus Pedo; which brings the event to the year 117. A comet was vi&s;ible the &s;ame year.</P>
<P>The earthquakes of this period were extremely violent&mdash;ma|ny cities were overthrown, mountains &s;unk, rivers were dried up and new fountains appeared.</P>
<P>Aurelius Victor adds to the&s;e calamities a great inundation of the Tyber, violent pe&s;tilence and famin; but to which of the periods, the year 107 or 117, he alludes, is not quite certain, tho probably to the latter. "Terrae motus gravis per provin|cias multas, atroxque pe&s;tilentia, fame&s;que et inundia facta &s;unt."</P>
<P>To remedy the danger from fire and earthquakes, Trajan limited the height of hou&s;es in Rome to 60 feet; and for that regulation obtained the title of "Father of the Country."</P>
<P>The great earthquake at Antioch was accompanied with fierce winds, a circum&s;tance not very common; it being more u&s;ual that &s;hocks of the earth happen during a perfect &s;erenity and tranquillity of the atmo&s;phere, unle&s;s in the vicinity of volca|noes.</P>

<P>During the time that Trajan was making war on the Agarini, a people of Arabia, which had revolted from the Roman gov|ernment, flies in myriads appeared and covered every ve&s;&s;el and uten&s;il, &s;o that the Emperor was compelled to abandon the ex|pedition.

<P>This fact ought not to be omitted; as the generation of innu|merable in&s;ects is one of the phenomena which generally attend a great pe&s;tilence&mdash;The &s;ame &s;ea&s;on was marked by terrible &s;torms of wind, rain and hail-&s;tones of unu&s;ual &s;ize. The win|ter

<P>Under the year 115, I find mentioned a &s;udden and violent inundation of the Severn in England, which drowned people in their beds, and de&s;troyed 5000 head of cattle. Perhaps phi|lo&s;ophy will place this event, under the year of the earthquake at Antioch; whichever may be the true year, 115 or 117.</P>
<P>In the chronological tables, a great earthquake in China is mentioned under the year 114&mdash;the year of the plague in Wales.</P>
<P>Under the Emperor Adrian, &s;ay the compilers of the Mag|deburgh hi&s;tory, from Eu&s;ebius, the greate&s;t part of Nicomedia and Nicea was overthrown by earthquakes; and not long after, Nicopolis and Ce&s;area were totally overwhelmed. Functius a&s;|&s;igns the fate of Nicomedia to the year 121, and that of Nicop|olis to 129. By another writer is noted a comet in 127, and a plague in Scotland.</P>

<P>In the reign of Antoninus Pius, A. D. 154, occurred an earthquake which pro&s;trated &s;ome towns in A&s;ia and Rhodes. A comet appeared nearly at the &s;ame time, and a pe&s;tilence in Arabia, together with an inundation of the Tyber.</P>

<P>Of the general and fatal pe&s;tilence in the reign of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and Lucius Verus, we have many accounts. It appeared in Rome in 167, but its origin was in A&s;ia, a year or two earlier. Ammianus Marcellinus, the philo&s;ophic &s;oldier, relates that this plague originated from the foul air of a &s;mall box or che&s;t, which a Roman &s;oldier had opened, in &s;earch of plunder, after the taking of Seleucia. Julius Capitolinus men|tions

the &s;ame fact on the authority of mere vulgar report or tradition. "Et nata <HI>fertur</HI> pe&s;tilentia in Babylonia, ubi de templo Apollonis ex arcula aurea, quam milis forte inciderat, &s;piritus pe&s;tilens eva&s;it, atque inde Parthos orbemque comple&s;&s;e."</P>
<P>A. Marcellinus gives a more particular account of this event. "Milites fanum &s;crutantes, invenere foramen angu&s;tum, quo re|&s;erato, ut pretio&s;um aliquid invenirent, ex adyto quodam con|clu&s;o a Chaldoeorum arcanis, labes primordalis ex&s;ilivit, quae in|&s;anabilium vi concepta morborum, eju&s;dem Veri et Marci Anto|nini temporibus, ab ip&s;is Per&s;arum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inibus, adu&s;que Rhenum, et Gallias Cuneta contagiis polluebat et mortibus."</P>
<P>That a clo&s;e box or other confined place, which might have been &s;hut for ages, &s;hould contain a pe&s;tiferous vapor which might de&s;troy the life of the man that fir&s;t opened it, is not only po&s;&s;ible, but very probable. But that this trifling quantity of nox|ious air &s;hould be &s;ufficient to generate a univer&s;al pe&s;tilence from the confines of Per&s;ia to Gaul, is a vulgar notion, preci&s;ely re|&s;embling the modern opinion that the plague is conveyed from country to country, in bales of goods.</P>
<P>The hi&s;torian adds, that the Emperor returned to Rome, and "luem &s;ecum deferre videreter," &s;eemed to carry the plague with him. But the Romans pa&s;&s;ed only from Seleucia to Rome; whereas the plague raged over the whole earth; &s;o that the di&s;|ea&s;e mu&s;t have originated in other countries, through which the Emperor did <HI>not</HI> pa&s;s, and from other cau&s;es than the noxious air of a little box. It raged in Gaul and in Scotland.</P>
<P>By attending to the phenomena of the phy&s;ical world, during this period, we &s;hall find cau&s;es fully adequate to the effect, with|out re&s;orting to the temple of Apollo in Seleucia. The &s;tate of the elements was deranged, and nature was every where agitated. An inundation of the Tyber at Rome laid all the low grounds, and a part of the city under water, &s;weeping away people, build|ings and cattle, and de&s;olating the fields. Famin and earth|quakes marked th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ame period. The air became in&s;alubrious, and myriads of caterpillars and other in&s;ects overran the earth and devoured vegetation.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="036687_0077_100AA10E98091768">The pe&s;tilence was violent and mortal, corre&s;ponding with the&s;e &s;ymptoms of derangement in the elements. In Rome, at one time, it is related, that the mortality extended to ten thou|&s;and per&s;ons in a day. Its preci&s;e duration, I do not find to be &s;pecified by the hi&s;torians; but it continued for a number of years; in the mid&s;t of which appeared a comet, about the year 169.</P>
<BIBL>See Am. Marcellinus, lib. 23, and Julius Capitolinus, in Vero. Aug. Hi&s;t. 580. Hi&s;t. of Emperors by Pedro Mexiae, p. 172. Echard's Rom. Hi&s;t. vol. 2. 315 to 322, who is more correct than Gibbon.</BIBL>
<P>Of the &s;ymptoms of this de&s;olating plague, I find no account, except that the patients had a light fever, and a gangrene appear|ed on the extremities of the feet.</P>
<P>It is proper here to notice a pa&s;&s;age in Gibbon's Hi&s;t. vol. 1. chap. 3, which de&s;cribes, as halcyon days, the period of the world in which this calamity occurred. The following are his words. "If a man were called upon to fix the period in the hi&s;tory of the world, during which the condition of the human race was <HI>mo&s;t happy</HI> and <HI>pro&s;perous,</HI> he would, without he&s;ita|tion, name that which elap&s;ed from the death of Domitian to the acce&s;&s;ion of Commodus;" that is, from the year 96 to 180.</P>
<P>It is certain that, at this time, the Roman Empire was in its glory, and governed by a &s;eries of able and virtuous princes, who made the happine&s;s of their &s;ubjects their principal object. But the coloring given to the happine&s;s of this period, is far too brilliant. The &s;ucce&s;s of armies and the extent of empire do not con&s;titute exclu&s;ively the happine&s;s of nations; and no hi&s;to|rian has a title to the character of fidelity, who does not com|prehend, in his general de&s;criptions of the &s;tate of mankind, moral and phy&s;ical, as well as political, evils.</P>
<P>During the period mentioned by Gibbon, not only Antioch, with the lo&s;s of mo&s;t of its inhabitants, amounting probably to more than 100,000, but thirteen other cities were demoli&s;hed by earthquakes. In the famous revolt of the Jews under Tra|jan, hi&s;torians relate that 450,000 Romans were ma&s;&s;acred in Syria, Cyprus and other countries; and in the wars undertaken by Adrian to &s;ubdue them, it is e&s;timated that 50 cities and 985
<PB N="74" REF="036687_0078_100AA11194038130">
towns were de&s;troyed, and 580,000 men lo&s;t their lives by famin, di&s;ea&s;e and the &s;word. The reign of the Antonines was di&s;tingui&s;hed for multifarious and &s;evere calamities. The de|&s;cription of them, by Aurelius Victor, ought to be given in his own words. Speaking of the Emperor M. Antonine, he &s;ays, "Ni&s;i ad illa tempora natus e&s;&s;et, profecto qua&s;i uno lap&s;u rui&s;&s;ent omnia &s;tatus Romani. Quippe ab armis nu&s;quam quies erat: perque omnem orientem, Illyricum, Italiam, Galliamque bella fervebant. Terrae motus non &s;ine interitu civitatum, inunda|tiones fluminum, lues crebrae, locustarum &s;pecies agris infe&s;tae, pror&s;us ut prope nihil, quo &s;ummis angoribus atteri mortales &s;o|lent, dici &s;eu cogitari queat, quod non illo imperante &s;aevierit."</P>
<BIBL>Epit. of the lives of the Emperors.</BIBL>
<P>"Unle&s;s he, M. Antonine, had been born at that juncture, the affairs of the empire would have fallen into &s;peedy ruin: for there was no re&s;pite from military operations. War raged in the ea&s;t, in Illyricum, in Italy and in Gaul. Earthquakes, with the de&s;truction of cities, inundations of rivers, frequent plagues, a &s;pecies of locu&s;ts ravaging the fields; in &s;hort every calamity that can be conceived to afflict and torment men, &s;courged the human race, during his admini&s;tration."</P>
<P>How can that be a "happy and pro&s;perous condition of men," in which they were &s;ubject to continual wars, to ma&s;&s;acres, to the ravages of in&s;ects, and to a &s;eries of plagues, which de&s;troy|ed probably one fourth of the inhabitants of the globe; and when the Roman empire was upon the brink of ruin? And how can a writer be e&s;teemed as a hi&s;torian, who &s;ub&s;titutes the flow|ers of rhetoric for &s;ober truth, and &s;arifices fact to embelli&s;hment?</P>
<P>In the year 173 a pe&s;tilence raged in the Roman armies, which threatened them with extermination.&mdash;This appears to have been a continuation of the plague before de&s;cribed. It prevailed in Rome in 175 and 178.</P>

<P><PB N="75" REF="036687_0079_100AA113713D3D68">In the reign of Commodus, about the year 187, Rome was again afflicted with a &s;evere plague, which was felt al&s;o in all parts of Italy, tho with le&s;s mortality than in the city. Hero|dian, lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, gives the following account of it. "A great pe&s;|tilence raged throughout Italy at that time, but with mo&s;t vio|lence in the city, by rea&s;on of the great concour&s;e of people a&s;&s;embled from all parts of the earth. The mortality among men and cattle was great. The Emperor, by advice of certain phy&s;icians retired to Laurentum, on account of the coolne&s;s of the place which was &s;haded with laurels, from which circum|&s;tance it derived its name. It was &s;uppo&s;ed al&s;o the effluvia from the laurels acted as an antidote again&s;t the contagion of the di&s;temper. The people in the city al&s;o, by advice of phy|&s;icians, filled their no&s;es and ears with &s;weet ointments, and con&s;tantly u&s;ed perfumes, for in popular opinion, they occupy the pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;en&s;es, with the&s;e odors, and &s;hut out the corrupt air; or if they do not wholly exclude it, they over|power its influence by &s;uperior force. But the&s;e things did not check the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, and men and cattle continued to peri&s;h."</P>
<P>The deaths amounted, in Rome, to 5000 in a day, for a con&s;iderable time. A famin prevailed at the &s;ame time, and hi&s;torians a&s;cribe it to Cleander, the mini&s;ter of Commodus, who had monopolized the corn, to compel people to purcha&s;e of him at an advanced price. Dion Ca&s;&s;ius however &s;ays, the year had been unfruitful. The pe&s;tilence continued three years. Indeed we may here remark once for all, that when we read of a plague of great extent and violence in any part of the world, under the date of a particular year, we may always con&s;ider that or other pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, as prevailing at lea&s;t three years. Rarely are great plagues of le&s;s duration, but often of greater. Hi&s;torians &s;eldom mention the pe&s;tilence, except in the year of its greate&s;t violence, but no plague, I will a&s;&s;ert, ever yet in|fe&s;ted a particular city or country, without precur&s;ors of a very malignant type. When therefore we &s;peak of pe&s;tilence, as prevailing in a particular year, we are to con&s;ider the epidemic as extending to a period of three, four or five years, perhaps
<PB N="76" REF="036687_0080_100AA11525E75E80">
to a much longer period, either in the form of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ague, a deadly petechial fever, or other fatal di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In the foregoing de&s;cription of the di&s;ea&s;e under Commodus, we notice the vulgar modes of guarding again&s;t contagion, by &s;tuffing the no&s;e and ears with aromatics&mdash;a practice that in part &s;ub&s;i&s;ts at this day, altho con&s;tant experience proves it to be ut|terly ineffectual.</P>
<P>It appears from Herodian that a comet appeared at this peri|od, or other &s;ingular heavenly phenomena. He &s;ays, "Ea tempe&s;tate &s;tellae per diem perpetuo apparuerant, quaedamque ex iis in longum productae medio qua&s;i aere &s;u&s;pen&s;ae videbantur." Comets are &s;ometimes vi&s;ible in the day time, and it is well known that many of the ancients con&s;idered them as meteors, floating in the earth's atmo&s;phere, as we &s;ee in Ari&s;totle, Seneca and Pliny, who have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and refuted tho&s;e opinions. See al&s;o Sampridius who mentions the comet and unu&s;ual darkne&s;s, at this period.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance mentioned by Herodian de&s;erves no|tice. He &s;ays, that animals at this time grew out of their u&s;ual &s;ize, a&s;&s;uming an extraordinary figure and di&s;proportioned in their parts. "Preterea animalia, genus omne, minime &s;uam naturam &s;ervantia, cum figura corporis prodigio&s;a, tum membris haudquaquam congruentibus edebantur." This fact the writer arranges under the head of <HI>prodigies;</HI> but numerous modern ob|&s;ervations confirm the veracity of the hi&s;torian. In many plagues, to be hereafter mentioned, myriads of unu&s;ual animals have ap|peared, and many common animals and in&s;ects have grown to an unu&s;ual &s;ize. With this fact almo&s;t invariably attending pe&s;|tilence, and before the eyes of every man of &s;cience in well at|te&s;ted accounts; a fact that demon&s;trates a prodigiou&s;ly pe&s;ti|lential &s;tate of the elements, modern philo&s;ophers, phy&s;icians and rulers have been tracing all the plagues of the earth to one or two little &s;pots in Egypt and the Levant&mdash;This circum&s;tance is hardly credible; yet is true, and indicates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> lamentable de|cline of &s;ound philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>A &s;light &s;hock of an earthquake is mentioned incidentally by Herodian, after the plague. Speaking of the burning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a

temple in Rome, he &s;ays "there had been no &s;torm or clouds, but a &s;mall earthquake preceded the conflagration:" and he in|&s;inuates that the building might have been &s;et on fire by a fla&s;h of lightning in the night, or by an eruption of fire in the earth|quake.</P>
<P>In 193, Canterbury in England was &s;everely &s;haken by an earthquake.</P>
<P>The plague prevailed in London in 211, and a comet ap|peared in the &s;ame year. In 214, there was a mo&s;t dreadful inundation of the river Trent in England, which &s;pread over 20 miles of country, and de&s;troyed many lives. Here is prob|ably a mi&s;take in chronology of at lea&s;t two years&mdash;or rather a difference between different authorities. Eu&s;ebius, the learned Bi&s;hop of Cae&s;aria, places the birth of Chri&s;t two years earlier, than the common or Diony&s;ian Chronology. Many authors fol|low one mode of computing time and many the other; and without the original authors, and a clo&s;e attention to their modes of reckoning time, it is not po&s;&s;ible to reconcile the&s;e differ|ences. The uniform influence of comets in producing violent tempe&s;ts and unu&s;ual &s;welling of the ocean, within a year of their appearance and after their departure, may a&s;&s;i&s;t in correct|ing ancient chronology.</P>
<P>In the year 218 two comets appeared, and a &s;evere fro&s;t of five months is related to have happened in England in 220.</P>

<P>In the reign of the Emperor Gordian, about the year 243, the earth was agitated by mo&s;t violent earthquakes; and in 245 there was a prodigious inundation of the &s;ea in Lincoln&s;hire, England, which laid under water many thou&s;and acres of land, which are &s;aid not yet to be recovered.

<P><PB N="78" REF="036687_0082_100AA11B83BEBD80">We have now arrived to one of the mo&s;t calamitous periods recorded in hi&s;tory&mdash;a period of mortal plagues, which com|menced about the year 250, or 252 in the reign of the Emperor Decius and continued fifteen or twenty years, through the ad|mini&s;tration of Gallus and Volu&s;ian, Valerian and Gallienus. This period was u&s;hered in by a comet in 250, the winter of which in England was &s;o &s;evere, that the Thames was frozen for nine weeks.&mdash;An eruption of Etna is noted under the year 253, and an earthquake in Cornwall in 251.</P>
<P>The plague appears to have been mo&s;t fatal in Rome at two different times, during this period; viz. in the years 252 and 262 or 3, including the year preceding and &s;ucceeding each of the&s;e periods. It reached the northern parts of Europe, and in 266, Scotland had &s;carcely living people enough to bury the dead.</P>
<P>It fir&s;t appeared in Ethiopia, on the confines of Egypt, and &s;pread over all the provinces of the Roman Empire, which, &s;ays Zonaras, were exce&s;&s;ively exhau&s;ted by its de&s;tructive ravages. Zo&s;imus, after de&s;cribing the deva&s;tation occa&s;ioned by the ir|ruption of the Scythians, &s;ays "Lues etiam pe&s;tilens in <HI>oppidis</HI> atque <HI>vicis</HI> &s;ub&s;ecuta, quicquid erat humani generis reliquum, ab&s;ump&s;it." The plague in <HI>towns</HI> and <HI>villages</HI> followed the Scythians and devoured that part of the human race which the barbarians had &s;pared.</P>
<P>Jornandes &s;ays, the pe&s;tilence "faciem totius orbis foedavit" &mdash;de&s;olated or disfigured the face of the whole earth.&mdash;In the reign of Gallienus, 5000 citizens of Rome peri&s;hed daily, in 262, or the following year, a portion of this period mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for convul&s;ions of the earth.</P>
<P>This latter period was marked by de&s;tructive earthquakes in Rome, Syria and other countries. In &s;ome places the earth opened and &s;alt water i&s;&s;ued. Trebellius Pollio &s;ays, "Fright|ful earthquakes &s;hook Italy, A&s;ia and Africa. For many days, [&s;ome authors &s;ay, <HI>three</HI> days] there was an unu&s;ual or preter|natural darkne&s;s and a hollow rumbling noi&s;e in the earth, which opened in many places.

<P>In the Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, it is &s;aid that this plague ravaged Capadocia and all A&s;ia Minor, and was followed by famin, earthquakes and a great comet or meteor.</P>
<P>Oro&s;ius remarks that "Nulla fere provincia Romana, nulla civitas, nulla domus fuit, quae non illa generali pe&s;tilentia cor|repta atque va&s;tata." Scarcely was there a province of the Em|pire, a city or a hou&s;e, which was not attacked and de&s;olated.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age is worthy of notice, for it will hereafter appear, that altho the plague is u&s;ually limited to cities, where powerful artificial or local cau&s;es aid the general contagion, yet in &s;ome in|&s;tances, the general &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere has been &s;o pe&s;tilen|tial, as to produce <HI>plague</HI> on the mo&s;t elevated hills and &s;alubri|ous places, in detached villages and hou&s;es, without the lea&s;t communication with the &s;ick and infected.</P>

<P>The &s;tate of the air, during this pe&s;tilence, was uncommonly impure. The de&s;cription of it by Eu&s;ebius, in a philo&s;ophical view, de&s;erves notice.

<P>Near the clo&s;e of this period, about the year 272, there was an eruption of Ve&s;uvius. At the &s;ame time, a &s;evere famin raged in England. Five or &s;ix years later, a &s;evere famin prevailed over the world. "Fames ingens per totum orbem gra&s;&s;ata e&s;t."</P>

<P><PB N="81" REF="036687_0085_100AA12299E0C180">It is proper here to notice an inaccuracy of the celebrated New|ton, in his Di&s;&s;ertations on the prophecies, on the 6th chapter of Revelations, in which he &s;ays, "In the reign of Probus al&s;o there was a great famin throughout the world&mdash;an u&s;ual <HI>con&s;e|quence</HI> of famin is pe&s;tilence.&mdash;This pe&s;tilence according to Zo|noras, ari&s;ing from Ethiopia, while Gallus and Volu&s;ian were Emperors, pervaded all the Roman provinces for fifteen years." But Probus began to reign in the year 276, whereas the pe&s;ti|lence broke out in Ethiopia under Decius or Gallus and Volu|&s;ian, about A. D. 252 according to Zonoras, but according to other authors, two or three years earlier. Therefore the pe&s;ti|lence under Gallus, could not be a <HI>con&s;equence</HI> of a famin under Probus, which was 25 years later than the plague a&s;cribed to it. The&s;e remarks are nece&s;&s;ary to correct that pa&s;&s;age of Newton, and they are u&s;eful in correcting the common notion, that the plague is u&s;ually occa&s;ioned by famin. The idea is probably un|philo&s;ophical; but is certainly contrary to fact. Famin often <HI>goes before</HI> the plague, and as often <HI>follows</HI> it. But &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;a&s;trous periods of the plague, have originated during the <HI>greate&s;t abundance</HI> of provi&s;ions.&mdash;Such was the fact in England, in 448, and in 1347, as will be hereafter related. The great er|ror of hi&s;torians and phy&s;icians has been, that ob&s;erving famin and pe&s;tilence often cotemporary, and the cau&s;e of the plague not being obvious to the &s;en&s;es, they have taken famin to be the cau&s;e. Whereas it will appear on careful inve&s;tigation, that fam|in is an <HI>effect</HI> of the &s;ame cau&s;e which produces the plague among men. The dearth of provi&s;ions, during this formidable epidemic, is the effect of a <HI>pe&s;tilence in vegetation;</HI> that is, a failure in the principles of vegetable life, which proceeds from the &s;ame de|rangement of the &s;ea&s;ons, or defect in the properties of air and water, which cau&s;es the plague among men.&mdash;Famin often aug|ments pe&s;tilence, and modifies the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e; but in a healthy &s;tate of the elements of life, air and water, famin will not produce the plague. This may be demon&s;trated by mul|tiplied in&s;tances of &s;eamen, &s;tarving on the ocean, who often per|i&s;h by hunger, without di&s;ea&s;e, or if they had di&s;ea&s;es in con&s;e|quence

<P>I cannot help noticing al&s;o the ob&s;ervations of Mr. Gibbon on the calamities of this period. He &s;ays, "Our habits of thinking &s;o fondly connect the order of the univer&s;e with the fate of man, that this gloomy period of hi&s;tory has been <HI>decora|ted</HI> with inundations, earthquakes, uncommon meteors, preter|natural darkne&s;s, and a crowd of prodigies <HI>fictitious</HI> or <HI>exagge|rated.</HI>"</P>

<P>If the original writers who have related the facts above men|tioned, had been as fond of <HI>decorations,</HI> as this author, we might well have di&s;tru&s;ted their accounts of unu&s;ual occurrences. Had this <HI>elegant</HI> writer taken due pains to inform him&s;elf of the truth, before he had indulged &s;uch reflections on the mo&s;t cred|ible hi&s;torians, he would have found &s;imilar phenomena to have attended the &s;ame calamity, pe&s;tilence, in every age from that period to the pre&s;ent, and many of them if not all, during his own life, if not within his own ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>He goes on to ob&s;erve that "famin is almo&s;t always followed by epidemical di&s;ea&s;es." This point will be afterwards con&s;idered.</P>
<P>He &s;ays al&s;o that the plague at this period "raged from 250 to 265, <HI>without interruption,</HI> in every province, <HI>every city</HI> and almo&s;t <HI>every family</HI> of the Roman Empire."</P>
<P>The words <HI>without interruption,</HI> were probably in&s;erted for the &s;ake of <HI>decoration.</HI> They are not authorized by the original writers; and cannot po&s;&s;ibly be true, for an uninterrupted plague in a city or country, would &s;oon leave it without an inhabitant. The truth is, it &s;eldom raged, more than &s;ix or eight months, in the &s;ame place, at one time. It &s;eized this town, one year, and that, the next, as we ob&s;erve in modern times, through the whole period.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The words of Zonoras per quindecem continuos annos, are to be under&s;tood as above explained.</NOTE></P>

<P>The &s;ame period was marked by deluges of rain, and from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of narration, it appears that the rains <HI>preceded</HI> the hard win|ter of the year 400. The rivers were &s;o &s;orelled as to prevent the imperial generals from pa&s;&s;ing into the ea&s;t to attack Sardis.&mdash; Severe earthquakes occurred in the &s;ame year.</P>
<P>About the year 407 or 8, near the clo&s;e of the reign of Arca|dius, a cele&s;tial phenomenon of a &s;ingular &s;pecies pre&s;ented it&s;elf to the view of an a&s;toni&s;hed world. It was called a comet, but did not re&s;emble one of the ordinary figure. It re&s;embled a cone or pillar, but had not the appearance of a &s;tar, &s;o much as of the flame of a lamp. Its motion was not regular&mdash;it began to move from the point of the heavens where the &s;un ri&s;es at the equinox|es, and pa&s;&s;ing the tail of Ur&s;a, proceeded to the we&s;t.</P>
<P>It mea&s;ured the heavens&mdash;its vertex, at &s;ome times, extended to a great length; at others, was contracted into the figure of a cone. After being vi&s;ible for four months, it di&s;appeared. This is the de&s;cription of it, nearly in the words of Nicephorus. Me|teors were ob&s;erved at the &s;ame period.</P>
<P>Accompanying an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> following the&s;e phenomena, were &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing calamities. Violent earthquakes levelled cit|ies&mdash;inundations of rivers and the &s;ea, followed by intolerable cold &s;torms of hail, and a drouth that bla&s;ted vegetation, by which means multitudes of people peri&s;hed. Pe&s;tilence raged in every quarter, and famin &s;o &s;evere, that the populace deman|ded

<P>In 418 appeared a comet; in 419 &s;everal cities of A&s;ia were overturned by an earthquake, and in 420 there was an eruption of Etna. There was al&s;o an inundation of the &s;ea in Hamp&s;hire, in England, in 419. Famin and pe&s;tilence prevailed al&s;o in this period.&mdash;A great &s;torm of hail is mentioned under the year 418, and deep &s;now.</P>
<P>The next period of general pe&s;tilence commenced in the reign of Theodo&s;ius the younger, about the year 445&mdash;or a year or two earlier. A comet in 442, u&s;hered in a &s;evere winter, in 443, the &s;now fell to &s;uch a depth and continued &s;o long in Illyri|cum, that multitudes of men, women and children peri&s;hed. The year preceding, the Huns had ravaged the country and de&s;troyed the provi&s;ions, which added to the public calamities. An irrup|tion of the Sea in North and South Wales, 441, preceded the fir&s;t comet, a &s;econd comet appeared in 444. In 445, &s;evere famin and plague di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Con&s;tantinople, and pe&s;tilence appear|ed in all parts of the world. In 446, Sept. 17, occured a tre|mendous earthquake, which demoli&s;hed the greate&s;t part of the walls of Con&s;tantinople, with fifty &s;even towers. The &s;hocks continued unremittingly for &s;ix months, and extended to a great part of the globe. Many cities were overthrown, the earth, in &s;ome places, was thrown into large hills; in others, it opened and &s;wallowed up whole towns. I&s;lands di&s;appeared and were lo&s;t in the ocean: the &s;ea receding, left &s;hips on dry land, &s;prings of water were dried up and new fountains appeared, and in this violent concu&s;&s;ion of the elements peri&s;hed innumerable multi|tudes of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The pe&s;tilence attending, and which rarely fails to attend &s;uch agitations of the earth, was univer&s;al and of &s;everal years dura|tion. In this period, the plague in England was corre&s;pond|ent
<PB N="89" REF="036687_0093_100A899AA630A450">
to the terrible operations of &s;ubterranean fire. In 448 or 9, it carried off incredible numbers of people, &s;o that the living could &s;carcely bury the dead.&mdash;And it mu&s;t not be omitted that the plague was preceded by the greate&s;t abundance of provi&s;ions. This was in the reign of Vortigern, and in time of peace.</P>

<P>An important fact here occurs. In 446, the Picts and Scots had overrun and de&s;olated England, &s;o as to occa&s;ion a dearth of provi&s;ions. But this famin produced no pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e. It is particularly noticed by the hi&s;torian, that the plague did not occur, till a year of great plenty had intervened. This is one &s;trong proof among others, that famin is not the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of plague; but often accompanies, and &s;ometimes increa&s;es the di&s;ea&s;e. It often happens that, during extraordinary agitations of the earth, the elements of vegetable life appear to be defective. The &s;ame cau&s;e which affects human health, &s;eems to prevent the growth or vitiate the pabulum of vegetables.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General de&s;criptions are &s;eldom correct. I have already taken notice of the mi&s;takes committed by Newton and Gibbon, who&s;e general de|&s;criptions lead, in the in&s;tances mentioned, to fal&s;e conclu&s;ions. A &s;imilar mi&s;take occurs in Henry's excellent Hi&s;tory of Britain, vol. 1. ch. 1. concerning the calamities of the Britons, in the period under con&s;ideration The author &s;ays, "the neglect of agriculture naturally produced a famin, which was followed by a pe&s;tilence."&mdash;The&s;e facts are not correctly &s;tated. The incur&s;ions of the Picts and Scots had occa&s;ioned the neglect of culture and a famin; but this famin was fol|lowed by plentiful crops, which were &s;ucceeded by pe&s;tilence.</NOTE></P>
<P>The clo&s;e of this period was peculiarly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing in Italy, Phrygia, Cappadocia and Galatia, where the famin compelled parents to devour their own children. The pe&s;tilence made great havoc, at the &s;ame time, and no remedy or alleviation could be found. The body was univer&s;ally inflamed and cover|ed with tumors. The di&s;ea&s;e de&s;troyed the eyes. A cough &s;uc|ceeded the eruption, and ended life on the third day.</P>
<BIBL>Niceph. lib. 15 ca. 10.</BIBL>
<P>This was in the beginning of the admini&s;tration of the Em|peror Marcian, which commenced in 450, in which year anoth|er comet was di&s;played in the heavens and a &s;ingular light or

<P>It mu&s;t be remarked here that Functius has placed this comet and the beginning of Marcian's reign, in 454. Such differ|ences in chronology cannot fail to embarra&s;s an inquiry like the pre&s;ent, the re&s;ults of which depend much on correctne&s;s of dates.</P>
<P>Nicephorus and Evagrius give a particular account of an earthquake which laid great part of Antioch in ruins in the &s;ec|ond year of the Emperor Leo, which was A. D. 458. A comet is noted under the preceding year. But they &s;ay further, that this event took place 347 complete years after the de&s;truc|tion of the city in the reign of Trajan, which was in 117. Now 347 years added to this number, give 464, for the year of the la&s;t cata&s;trophe.</P>

<P>In the 311th Olympiad, which comprehends the years from 465 to 468 inclu&s;ive, appeared a comet. Whether the de|&s;truction of Antioch was in 458 or 464, the extent of the &s;hock, through Thrace, Helle&s;pont and the Grecian i&s;les, to|gether with the deluges of rain which are &s;aid to have &s;wept away whole towns in Bithynia, leave no room to que&s;tion the ap|proximation of a comet at or near the time.</P>

<P>This latter period was di&s;tingui&s;hed for pe&s;tilence which raged in Rome, about the acce&s;&s;ion of Anthemius to the empire, and according to Baronius in the year 467.</P>

<P>In the following year, a number of hou&s;es were overthrown by an earthquake at Vienna. Of the extent and dura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of the pe&s;tilence, I have no particular de&s;cription.

<P>In the year 480 Con&s;tantinople again &s;uffered great damage by an earthquake, which demoli&s;hed a great number of buildings.</P>
<P>In 480 or the following year another comet was vi&s;ible; or probably two years later. In 484 occurred a drouth mo&s;t terri|ble

<P>Baronius places the earthquake at Con&s;tantinople in 477, but others place it in 480, which is mo&s;t probably correct. The dif|ference in the chronology of different authors, who relate the events of the&s;e early ages, is &s;eldom le&s;s than two, three and four years.&mdash;The plague infe&s;ted Scotland in 480.</P>
<P>In 494 an earthquake overturned Laodicea, Hierapolis and Tripoli. According to Functius, this event was in 496.</P>

ruin by an earthquake.

A conflagration followed and con&s;umed what was left of the city. In the &s;ame &s;hocks, Dyrrachium, now Durazzo, the Epidaurus of high antiquity, Corinth and other cities were greatly injured.</P>

<P>A &s;evere winter happened the &s;ame year.</P>
<P>In 528 Antioch was again &s;haken and &s;uffered con&s;iderable injury. An inundation of the Humber in England is noted about this time.</P>
<P>In 531 appeared the re&s;plendent comet, who&s;e revolution is fixed at 575 years, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame which was vi&s;ible in the year before Chri&s;t 44, after the death of Julius Ce&s;ar. This was the fifth year of the reign of Ju&s;tinian. Famin and a &s;light plague prevailed in Wales.</P>
<P>At this period Gibbon commences his lively, but unphilo&s;oph|ical de&s;cription of the formidable and de&s;tructive calamities, which afflicted the whole earth in the 6th century. See his hi&s;|tory, vol. 4. ch. 43.</P>
<P>Not long after the approach of the comet in 531, the &s;un a&s;|&s;umed a pale color, and &s;hone with a feeble light. In a tran&s;la|tion of Cedrenus, this phenomenon is thus de&s;cribed. "Toto anno eo, &s;ol lunae in&s;tar, &s;ine radiis, lucem tri&s;tem praebuit, ple|rumque defectum patienti &s;imilis." During the whole year, the &s;un gave a gloomy light, like the moon, and appeared as if eclip|&s;ed.</P>
<BIBL>Byzantine Hi&s;t. 3. 293. Procop. de bell. Vandal. lib. 4.</BIBL>
<P>It is remarkable that tradition has pre&s;erved a faint account of a &s;imilar phenomenon, during the approach of the &s;ame comet, at the time of the Ogygean inundation, before Chri&s;t 1767. It is &s;aid, that the planet Venus changed her color, &s;ize and figure. An account is pre&s;erved in tradition, of a phenomenon of the &s;ame nature, during the approach of the &s;ame &s;tar, in a &s;ub&s;e|quent revolution. Gibbon in the chapter above cited.&mdash;Pliny, as I have already remarked, mentions a &s;imilar phenomenon,
<PB N="93" REF="036687_0097_100AA13BED99FB10">
about the time the &s;ame comet appeared, &s;oon after the death of Julius Ce&s;ar.</P>
<P>The appearance, in the period under con&s;ideration, is a well authenticated fact, and witne&s;&s;es a &s;ingular change in the prop|erties, and reflecting powers of the atmo&s;phere, or denotes an e&s;&s;ential alteration in the face of the &s;un, which is improbable. In either ca&s;e, it &s;eemed a prelude to the mo&s;t dreadful calami|ties, famin, earthquakes, and pe&s;tilence. I am not without &s;u&s;|picions that Europe might have been over&s;pread with a vapor like that in 1783, during the eruption of Heckla.</P>
<P>In 534 is recorded one of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing famins, that ever afflicted the earth; it continued many years, and de&s;troyed mul|titudes of the human race. Pompeiopolis was this year over|whelmed in ruin by an earthquake, and great numbers of its inhabitants peri&s;hed.</P>
<BIBL>Paul. Diac. lib. 16.</BIBL>
<P>About this period, Ve&s;uvius began to utter hollow rumbling noi&s;es, the precur&s;ors of an eruption.</P>
<BIBL>Baron. vol. 7. 218. Procop. de Bell. Goth. Magdeb. Cent. 6. p. 793.</BIBL>
<P>Excepting a &s;light plague in Wales&mdash;no pe&s;tilence is mention|ed by the authors I have con&s;ulted, until the year 542. But the famin, in great &s;everity, had raged eight or nine years be|fore &mdash;a proof that &s;omething more than famin is nece&s;&s;ary to generate the plague.</P>
<P>In 539 appeared another comet, and the famin now raged with double horror. The country of Italy had been ravaged, the year before by the Goths and Burgundians, and the lands left untilled. This might have contributed towards the dearth which followed. It is recorded that many per&s;ons fed on hu|man fle&s;h, &s;ome di&s;tricts of Italy were de&s;erted, 50,000 people peri&s;hed in Picenum, and greater numbers in other di&s;tricts. The bodies of the fami&s;hed people became thin and pale; the &s;kin was hardened and dry like leather, and clave to the bones; the fle&s;h a&s;&s;umed a dark appearance like charcoal, the counte|nance was &s;en&s;ele&s;s and &s;tern, the bile redundant.</P>

<P>Among the&s;e frightful effects of hunger, no plague yet ap|pears
<PB N="94" REF="036687_0098_100AA13D9F0B0968">
&mdash;a circum&s;tance that the philo&s;opher &s;hould not pa&s;s unno|ticed.</P>
<P>The account which Baronius gives of this famin, is, perhaps more philo&s;ophical and de&s;erves notice. He &s;ays, the crops failed, corn ripened prematurely, and was thin; in &s;ome places, it was not harve&s;ted, and that which was gathered, was defi|cient in nouri&s;hment. Tho&s;e who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon it became pale, and were afflicted with bile. The body lo&s;t its heat and vigor, the &s;kin was dried, the countenance &s;tupid, di&s;torted and gha&s;t|ly, the liver turned black. Many peri&s;hed by hunger; many betook them&s;elves to the fields to feed on vegetables, and being too feeble to pull them, lay down and gnawed them off with their teeth.</P>
<BIBL>Baronius, lib. 7. 326.</BIBL>
<P>This is the mo&s;t probable account of the famin. Repeated in&s;tances are on record, which evidently mark a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of the elements, as fatal to vegetable, as to animal life. In many periods of the world, there has been a univer&s;al defect in the powers of vegetation. This phenomenon in the vegetable kingdom is cotemporary, or nearly &s;o, with pe&s;tilence among men; and &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers have a&s;cribed the plague to a prior or cotemporary famin. But an accurate &s;urvey of facts, will probably convince any candid enquirer after truth, of the fallacy of this opinion. It will be made apparent that famin and pe&s;ti|lence are equally the <HI>effects</HI> of &s;ome general cau&s;e; a temporary derangement of the regular operations of nature.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, the famin could not be exclu&s;ively and immediately the cau&s;e of the formidable plague that afterwards a&s;&s;ailed mankind, for it was mo&s;t &s;evere in 539, and the next year the crops were good. But the plague did not break out till 542, at lea&s;t I can find no account of any pe&s;tilence, during the famin.</P>
<P>An eruption of Ve&s;uvius is noted under the year 532, the year after the appearance of the great comet.&mdash;It is probable that the palene&s;s of the &s;un was owing to a vapor from &s;ome volcanic eruption, as in 1783; and it is remarkable that both of the&s;e periods alike produced famin from defective vegetation.</P>

It ravaged the whole world, &s;eizing all de&s;criptions of people, without regard to dif|ferent con&s;titutions, habits or ages; and without regard to their places of re&s;idence, their modes of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence or their different pur&s;uits. Some were &s;eized in winter, &s;ome in &s;ummer; others in other &s;ea&s;ons of the year.</P>
<P>It fir&s;t appeared in Pelu&s;ium in Egypt and thence &s;pread we&s;t|ward to Alexandria and all parts of Egypt; ea&s;tward towards Pale&s;tine, and extended to all parts of the world, laying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;te i&s;lands, caves, mountains, and all places where men dwelt. If it pa&s;&s;ed by a particular country at fir&s;t, or <HI>&s;lightly affected it,</HI> it &s;oon returned upon it with the &s;ame de&s;olating rage which other places had experienced.&mdash;It began in maritime towns and &s;pread to the interior country. It &s;eized Con&s;tantinople in the &s;pring of 543.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t per&s;ons were &s;eized &s;uddenly without any premonition, nor was there any change of color or &s;en&s;e of heat; for until evening the fever was &s;o &s;light that the patient was not ill, nor did the phy&s;ician, from the pul&s;e, apprehend danger. But in &s;ome ca&s;es, the &s;ame day; in others, the next; in others, at a later period, a bubo aro&s;e, either in the groin, the arm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">its, or
<PB N="97" REF="036687_0101_100A89A8B15FB988">
near the ear, or in &s;ome other part. All patients alike had the&s;e &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>Some were &s;eized with drow&s;ine&s;s and &s;lumbering; others with furious di&s;traction. The &s;lumberers forgot all things&mdash;&s;ome would eat if de&s;ired; others were neglected and &s;tarved.</P>
<P>Neither phy&s;ician nor attendant caught the di&s;temper by con|tact of the &s;ick or dead; and many, encouraged by their won|derful e&s;cape, applied them&s;elves with a&s;&s;iduity to the care of the &s;ick and the burial of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Many were &s;eized, they knew not from what cau&s;e, and &s;ud|denly died. Some who were given over by phy&s;icians unexpect|edly recovered; others who appeared to be in no danger &s;peed|ily expired. Many died for want of relief; others recovered without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. No cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e could be devi&s;ed by human rea&s;on&mdash;no means of prevention or cure. To &s;ome, bathing was beneficial; to others, injurious. Many leaped into water and the &s;ea&mdash;In many the bubo, without &s;leep or delivium, turned into a gangrene, and the&s;e died with excruciating torture.</P>
<P>The phy&s;icians opened the bodies of &s;ome, and found within the &s;ores huge carbuncles. Tho&s;e who&s;e bodies were &s;potted with black pimples, of the &s;ize of a lentil, lived not a day. Tho&s;e who had running &s;ores e&s;caped, and the&s;e were the mo&s;t certain &s;igns of recovery. Some had their thighs withered; others lo&s;t the u&s;e of their tongues.</P>
<P>To women with child, the di&s;ea&s;e was certain death.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e in Con&s;tantinople la&s;ted four months, raging three months with extreme mortality. In the beginning, few died more than u&s;ual; but the di&s;ea&s;e gradually increa&s;ed, till it &s;wept off 10,000 per&s;ons in a day."</P>
<P>Procopius calls it arrogance to pretend to a&s;&s;ign the natural cau&s;es of this pe&s;tilence, declaring them to be undi&s;coverable.</P>
<BIBL>Per&s;ic. lib. 2. ca. 22.</BIBL>
<P>Authors mention the early effects of this di&s;ea&s;e on the brain; the patients, on the fir&s;t attack, &s;aw phantoms of evil &s;pirits, which made them imagine them&s;elves &s;mitten by &s;ome per&s;on.</P>
<P>Evagrius, who felt the effects of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e him&s;elf and

When I &s;ay, <HI>the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> I refer however to a &s;ub&s;equent epidemic. Procopius, as an eye witne&s;s, de&s;cribed the pe&s;tilence of 543 in Con&s;tantinople. It did not continue ince&s;&s;antly to rage in every place, for this would have &s;oon left the earth without an inhabitant; but after an interval of a few years, it returned and revi&s;ited the &s;ame places. The plague de&s;cribed by Evagrius was many years &s;ub&s;equent to that men|tioned by Procopius. He wrote about the year 594. His de|&s;criptions however are general.</P>
<BIBL>See Hi&s;t. Eccle&s;. lib. 4. ca. 29.</BIBL>
<P>"I will now de&s;cribe the plague, which has prevailed in the&s;e times, and already raged fifty-two years, a thing never before known, and has already depopulated the world. Two years after the taking of Antioch by the Per&s;ians,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under Cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roes A. D. 540</NOTE> a pe&s;tilential di&s;|ea&s;e began to prevail, in &s;ome re&s;pects re&s;embling that which Thucydides has de&s;cribed, in other re&s;pects different. It had its origin in Ethiopia, according to common report, and &s;pread over the whole world, falling on different places by turns, and &s;paring none of the human race.</P>
<P>Some cities were &s;o &s;everely a&s;&s;ailed by this di&s;ea&s;e, that they were left without an inhabitant. Some di&s;tricts however were more &s;lightly affected. The pe&s;tilence did not always begin its attacks at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on of the year, nor cea&s;e to rage, in all places in the &s;ame manner. In &s;ome places it broke out in the mid&s;t of winter; in others, in the &s;pring; in &s;ome, it began in &s;ummer; in others, in autumn; and in &s;ome cities, it attacked certain parts of the town, and left others untouched.</P>
<P>Very often we might ob&s;erve, particular families all peri&s;hed, in a city where the di&s;ea&s;e did not prevail, as an epidemic. In &s;ome places, one or two families only peri&s;hed, while the re&s;t of the city e&s;caped. But we ob&s;erved particularly that the families which e&s;caped, the fir&s;t year, experienced the &s;ame calamity in the year &s;ucceeding.</P>
<P>But what above all appeared &s;ingular and &s;urpri&s;ing was, that
<PB N="99" REF="036687_0103_100AA141E5F9BDA0">
the inhabitants of infected places, removing their re&s;idence to places, where the di&s;ea&s;e had not appeared, or did not prevail, were the only per&s;ons who fell victims to the plague, in the cities which were not infected. And the&s;e effects were particularly ob&s;ervable, both in cities and in other places, in the cycles of the <HI>Indictions.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>cycle of indiction</HI> was a period of 15 years, at the end of which the Romans paid a certain tax to the Emperors.</NOTE> E&s;pecially in the &s;econd year of each indiction, was the plague extremely mortal. Of this I am my&s;elf a wit|ne&s;s, for it may not be improper, when the occa&s;ion &s;eems to require it, to interweave into this hi&s;tory what concerns my&s;elf. At the commencement of this calamity, I was &s;eized with the <HI>inguinal plague;</HI> and in the di&s;ea&s;es, which have at different times prevailed, I have lo&s;t many of my children, my wife and great numbers of my kindred, of my &s;ervants and laborers: the cycles of indiction parcelling out my calamities among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>At the time of writing this account, the di&s;ea&s;e had already invaded Antioch the fourth time; the fourth cycle of indiction had pa&s;&s;ed, after the fir&s;t inva&s;ion of this di&s;ea&s;e, when I lo&s;t a daughter, and her &s;on.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e was a compound of various others. For in &s;ome per&s;ons, &s;eizing the head, it rendered the eyes &s;anguineous and the face tumid: Then falling upon the throat, &s;oon put an end to life in all that were thus &s;eized. Some were afflicted by di&s;charges from the bowels. In others an ab&s;ce&s;s formed in the groin, a raging fever followed, and the &s;econd or third day, the patient died, with his body and his mind apparently &s;ound, as tho they had not felt di&s;ea&s;e. Some were &s;eized with delir|ium and expired. Carbuncles al&s;o ari&s;ing on the body extin|gui&s;hed the lives of many. Others recovered once and again, and afterwards died of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The modes of contracting the di&s;ea&s;e were various and all cal|culation was baffled. Some peri&s;hed by once entering infected hou&s;es, or remaining in them&mdash;&s;ome by only touching the &s;ick. Some contracted the di&s;ea&s;e in open market. Others, who fled from the infected places, remained &s;afe, while they commu|nicated
<PB N="100" REF="036687_0104_100AA143E4EE6C08">
the di&s;ea&s;e to others who died. Many who remained with the &s;ick, and freely handled them as well as dead bodies, wholly e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e. Others who had lo&s;t their children and dependents, and in de&s;pair &s;ought death, by attempting to throw them&s;elves in the way of infection and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly attend|ing the &s;ick, found all their efforts in vain; they could not con|tract the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The di&s;temper has already prevailed fifty-two years, to this time, exceeding all preceding plagues: For Philo&s;tratus was &s;urpri&s;ed that, in his time, that calamity had prevailed for fif|teen years. What will happen hereafter is uncertain, &s;ince all things are at the di&s;po&s;al of God who under&s;tands the cau&s;es of things and the events."</P>
<P>Thus far Evagrius. See al&s;o Nicephorus lib. 17. ca. 18.</P>
<P>The reader is de&s;ired to attend particularly to the foregoing relation of facts, as &s;ome important conclu&s;ions will, in the &s;e|quel, be drawn from them, and other authorities hereafter to be cited.</P>
<P>It will be remarked that altho authors &s;peak of this pe&s;tilen|tial period, as of fifty-two years duration, as Evagrius and Gib|bon have done, yet this is not accurate. Evagrius, from whom this number is copied, &s;ays, the pe&s;tilence had then prevailed fifty-two years; but it was &s;till raging, and what was to happen afterwards, he could not determin.</P>
<P>The truth is, plagues were uncommonly frequent during this period; but the di&s;ea&s;e did not prevail without intervals. On the contrary, the years remarkable for mortality are &s;pecified by hi&s;torians, viz. 542 and 3, 547, 558, 562 to 565, 582 and 3, 587, and finally one of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive periods of all was 590 and the few following years. Altho this was a long and &s;evere period of calamity, yet from the be&s;t accounts I can ob|tain, I &s;ee no rea&s;on to believe the mortality, in any given term of five or ten years, from 542 to 600, to have been greater, than in &s;ome other periods of the &s;ame duration. More people probably died in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, in the reign of the An|tonines &mdash;in that of Gallus and Volu&s;ian&mdash;and far more, in the dreadful plague of 1346 to 50.&mdash;It is even probable that in the
<PB N="101" REF="036687_0105_100AA14665584D80">
la&s;t 50 years of the 16th century, the earth &s;u&s;tained as great a lo&s;s of inhabitants as in the &s;ame &s;pace of time in the 6th centu|ry. General de&s;criptions are rarely correct, and Mr. Gibbon's unphilo&s;ophical, tho eloquent <HI>flouri&s;hing</HI> de&s;cription of the mi&s;e|ries of the human race, in Ju&s;tinian's reign is calculated to mi&s;|lead a carele&s;s reader.</P>
<P>Evagrius indeed &s;ays, this plague exceeded all preceding ones. This is natural; Thucydides &s;aid the &s;ame of the di&s;ea&s;e in his time. But we are more able to form a correct compari&s;on between the different epidemics that have prevailed, than the co|temporaries with any particular one.</P>
<P>Agathius relates that in the pe&s;tilence at Con&s;tantinople in 558, many died &s;uddenly as with an apoplexy. The mo&s;t ro|bu&s;t con&s;titutions &s;urvived only to the 5th day. The critical period in the Athenian plague was the 7th or 9th. Thucydides makes no mention of the &s;tupor at the beginning of the di&s;tem|per, nor of the volutatio humi, whirling of the earth, or dizzi|ne&s;s, nor of buboes, nor of the effects of the di&s;ea&s;e on preg|nant women.</P>

<P>Warnefred relates of this pe&s;tilence, in Liguria, where it was particularly mortal, that there appeared &s;uddenly certain marks "quaedam &s;ignacula," upon the doors of hou&s;es, on garments, and uten&s;ils, which could not be wa&s;hed out but grew brighter by wa&s;hing. The next year, appeared in men's groins, or other delicate parts of the body, tumors like nuts or dates, which were &s;oon followed by intolerable fever, which extingui&s;hed life in three days. If the patient &s;urvived the third day, he had hopes of recovery.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have ranked this account among the fictions of a di&s;|turbed imagination, had not more recent and well atte&s;ted facts given me rea&s;on to credit it.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription of the terrible effects of this di&s;ea&s;e in Italy by the &s;ame author, is melancholy and painful to the reader.</P>
<P>The dy&s;entery which raged in France in 548 was accompanied with &s;igns of the plague, and was nearly equal to it in mortality. The plague raged this year at Mun&s;ter, in Ireland.</P>

<P><PB N="102" REF="036687_0106_100AA14870537D90">The de&s;olating plague of 590 was mortal almo&s;t beyond ex|ample, and preceded or attended with extraordinary phenomena. In 588 Antioch was overwhelmed by a violent earthquake, and 60,000 people buried in its ruins. The inundation of the Tyber exceeded all that had been known, as did the drouth of the &s;uc|ceeding &s;ummer. The intervening winter was equally remarka|ble for its &s;everity&mdash;"qualem vix aliquis prius recolebat fui&s;&s;e," &s;ays Warnefred; &s;uch as the olde&s;t per&s;ons could &s;carcely recol|lect.

<P>Africa was almo&s;t depopulated by this plague. So &s;udden and rapid was the di&s;ea&s;e in its action, that during a proce&s;&s;ion in Rome, in&s;tituted by St. Gregory, on account of that calamity, no le&s;s than eighty per&s;ons fell dead in the &s;treet.</P>

<P>Gregory of Tours relates, that the plague, at that time, was introduced into Gaul by a ve&s;&s;el and her cargo, but it did not &s;pread regularly from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, but &s;tarted up in di&s;tant and detached places, like fire in a field of &s;tubble.

<P>The next pe&s;tilential period is remarkable for the violence of the operations of nature.</P>
<P>In 740 a tremendous earthquake, or rather a continuation of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;hocks for twelve months, announced the commence|ment of a &s;eries of calamities. It began on the 7th Kal. No|vember, and demoli&s;hed buildings, &s;tatues and walls in Con|&s;tantinople, with a multitude of cities in Thrace, Nicomedia and Bythinia. Sigibert places the&s;e events in 741.</P>
<P>In 742, or as others &s;ay in 743, a mo&s;t &s;evere drouth was followed by mo&s;t terrible earthquakes. The next year appeared a comet and the year following, another; and the third year af|ter the drouth, which was either in 745 or 6, according to dif|ferent authors, a remarkable thick darkne&s;s covered the earth from Augu&s;t to October. At this time the plague was raging at Calabria in Naples, and it continued to &s;pread with dreadful havock for &s;everal &s;ucceeding years, in the countries of the ea&s;t. So violent was it in Con&s;tantinople in 746, that the living could not bury the dead; but the bodies were carried in cart-loads and thrown into empty ci&s;terns, and any place that would conceal them from the &s;ight. Fatal indeed was the di&s;ea&s;e, when "eo|dem die aliquis mortuum efferebat, et ip&s;e mortuus afferebatur"&mdash; the man who buried a corp&s;e, was &s;ometimes carried, the &s;ame day, to his grave.</P>

for three months, convul&s;ed by earthquakes. In the &s;ame year commenced a famin, and a plague of three years duration, which de&s;olated the whole earth. Cotemporary authors affirm that more than half the human race peri&s;hed. The living were fatigued with burying the dead&mdash;"ut &s;epelientium taedio, vivi ad huc &s;piritum trahentes, obruerenter cum mortuis." Such was the wearine&s;s of tho&s;e that buried the corp&s;es, that the living before their breath had left their bodies, were tumbled into the graves with the dead.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of this horrible de&s;truction, Ve&s;uvius di&s;charged prodigious quantities of lava which laid wa&s;te the neighboring country.</P>
<P>In 1009 was &s;een a comet in May. The beginning of the year the earth was deluged with rain, and a plague among the Saxons followed.</P>
<P>The plague is al&s;o mentioned under the year 1012, with vi|olent rains and inundations, followed by an earthquake in 1013. But the nece&s;&s;ary materials for a detail are wanting.</P>

<P>In 1015 appeared a comet, attended with violent tempe&s;ts, and followed by famin in 1016. In 1017 another comet was &s;een, and the following year is noted as pe&s;tilential. But I have no particulars.</P>
<P>In 1020 was &s;een another comet, and the winter was exce&s;|&s;ively &s;evere, &s;o that men peri&s;hed with cold. This was fol|lowed by pe&s;tilence, in which the bodies of the infected gene|rated "&s;erpents," &s;ays the hi&s;torian; by which he probably means &s;ome &s;pecies of worms.

<P>In 1021 was an earthquake, and the next year, the drouth and heat were extreme.</P>

<P>During an eclip&s;e of the &s;un in 1032 or 3, authors mention a &s;ingular phenomenon&mdash;a &s;affron color in the air, which gave to the human countenance a cadaverous a&s;pect. But it might be merely the effect of a partial darkne&s;s, with a hazy atmo&s;phers.</P>
<P>A &s;evere winter in 1035, was followed by an eruption of Ve&s;uvius in 1036. The frequent coincidences of this kind de|&s;erve notice.</P>
<P>In 1037 is noted an igneous appearance in the heavens, like a beam. The&s;e phenomena were followed by pe&s;tilence in Eng|land and in the Emperor's army, and with earthquakes.</P>

<P>In 1042 commenced another di&s;tre&s;&s;ing period. A comet in this year was followed by an eruption of Ve&s;uvius in 1043 and &s;now in harve&s;t. The year 1042 was very tempe&s;tuous and rainy; the dykes in Flanders yielded to the &s;welling ocean, and the low grounds were overwhelmed, with infinite de&s;truction. At this time began a general famin in England, France and Germany. The year 1043 was al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed for rains and &s;torms; autumnal &s;nows were early, and an infectious di&s;ea&s;e carried off va&s;t numbers of cattle. In 1044 there was great mortality among men.</P>
<P>In 1047 fell a deep &s;now in the we&s;t of Europe, which over|whelmed &s;mall trees, and lay till March. In March 1048 was a violent earthquake, followed by a tempe&s;tuous &s;ea&s;on and great &s;ickne&s;s. There was an eruption of Ve&s;uvius the &s;ame year, and an earthquake in October. The reader will remark a very regular connection between eruptions of volcanoes and violent winds.</P>

<P>In 1113 or, as &s;ome authorities have it, in May 1114, a comet appeared, and in a period of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing calamities. In this year there was an eruption from Heckla in Iceland.</P>

In June a dreadful tempe&s;t laid wa&s;te whole countries, and the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the &s;ummer produced dy&s;|entery and other pe&s;tilential epidemics. In 1114 many cities in Syria were pro&s;trated by an earthquake; and its effects were felt in all the oriental countries. In November 1115 many hou&s;es in Antioch were &s;wallowed up in a cha&s;m rent in the earth. In January 1116 various places &s;uffered by &s;hocks of the earth, and in 1117 all Italy was &s;haken for forty days.</P>
<P>In 1113 Flanders was overwhelmed by an inundation, which compelled many Flemmings to abandon their country, and they &s;ettled in England.</P>

<P>The winter of 1115 was mo&s;t rigorous, and a terrible mor|tality &s;wept away the cattle. A comet appeared this year al&s;o.</P>
<P>The year 1116 was rainy and fruits were de&s;troyed. In 1117 &s;warms of locu&s;ts about Jeru&s;alem devoured vegetation, and in England great damage was done by floods.</P>
<P>In 1118 and 1119 earthquakes were violent. In 1120 the locu&s;ts and mice overran Judea, and Trent &s;uffered much from earthquakes. A &s;evere winter followed in 1121, and a drouth the next year, which occa&s;ioned a &s;carcity of provi&s;ion, and men and cattle peri&s;hed.</P>

<P>If men, at this period, had any re&s;pite from natural evils, the intervals were very &s;hort. In 1150 a very &s;evere winter and &s;evere pe&s;tilence are recorded in the Saxon chronicle, together with famin and an eruption of fire in Iceland. Earthquakes, inundations and pe&s;tilence marked the &s;ub&s;equent years. The years 1151 and 2 are mentioned to have been very rainy&mdash;the winter of 1153 and 4 &s;evere, and the &s;ummer of 1156 exce&s;|&s;ively dry. The&s;e phenomena follow each other &s;o rapidly, and are related with &s;uch brevity and in general terms, that it leaves the mind at a lo&s;s to what influence to a&s;cribe the di&s;ea&s;es which afflicted nations for a &s;eries of years about this period. In this gloomy and barbarous age of the world, hi&s;tory is conci&s;e and de&s;titute of accurate ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>In 1157 there was an eruption in Iceland, with a very cold winter. In 1158 an eruption of Ve&s;uvius, an earthquake in England, and an inudation of the Tyber. Pe&s;tilence appeared in Scotland in 1154.</P>
<P>Not long after the&s;e events, Antioch, Tripoli, and Dama&s;|cus were convul&s;ed by an earthquake, with the lo&s;s of 20,000 lives.</P>
<P>After an interval of more than 300 years, during which I find in hi&s;tory no account of any eruptions from Etna, this vol|cano is introduced to our notice by an almo&s;t continual eruption from 1160 to 1169. Earthquakes were violent in 1161&mdash;in Sicily an inundation drowned 5000 people&mdash;in 1163 one of the greate&s;t inundations in Frie&s;land ever known, preceded by a very &s;evere winter. At this time the plague was raging in Mi|lan, Normandy and Aquitain. Unu&s;ual darkne&s;s is mentioned in 1164. In England, the &s;ea overflowed twelve miles of country, de&s;troying men, cattle and improvements. In 1165, a comet appeared with a long coma; 12,000 people peri&s;hed by an inundation in Sicily, and Norfolk and Suffolk in England

<P>In 1169 the eruption of Etna was very violent; Catana was demoli&s;hed by an earthquake, and 15,000 people peri&s;hed &mdash;A&s;ia Minor felt the &s;hock. In the next year, &s;o general and tremendous were the earthquakes, that many of the be&s;t cities in Syria, Pale&s;tine and other countries, were laid in ruins. Germany &s;uffered by earthquakes and inundations. Pe&s;tilence marked this period, and in 1172 a malignant dy&s;entery raged in England.</P>
<P>In 1174 mention is made, for the fir&s;t time, of an epidemic cough or catarrh. There is however no que&s;tion that influenza and mea&s;les always preceded or accompanied pe&s;tilence in the ancient and middle ages, as they do in modern times. Authors have neglected to record the prevalence of all the minor epi|demics, or nearly all, until after the invention of printing.</P>
<P>In 1175 hi&s;tory mentions an eruption of Etna, pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es in England and a famin. In 1176 a long and &s;evere winter, and an irruption of the &s;ea into Holland with immen&s;e de&s;truction&mdash;a &s;evere drouth followed with a lo&s;s of &s;eed time.

<P>In 1178 a comet was &s;ucceeded by a mo&s;t rigorous winter, and de&s;tructive inundations. On the 11th of September, was a dark day, with &s;ingular appearances of the &s;un and moon. A|nother comet is mentioned in 1179 and a great hail &s;torm.</P>
<P>In 1181 appeared a comet, and earthquakes, with an eruption of Etna, marked this period.&mdash;At this time Denmark was al|mo&s;t laid de&s;olate by exce&s;&s;ive rains, famin and pe&s;tilence, while Germany lo&s;t half of its inhabitants by the plague. Some al|lowance mu&s;t be made for exaggeration in the accounts of the more de&s;tructive plagues. This was an age of &s;uper&s;tition, and the imaginations of men were &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In 1185 is recorded a mo&s;t violent earthquake, over Europe. Calabria was overturned, and thou&s;ands peri&s;hed. On the Adriatic, a whole city was &s;wallowed up, and the &s;hock was felt to the Baltic.</P>

<P>In 1193 and 4 exce&s;&s;ive rains injured the grain and produced a dearth. In England an acute pe&s;tilential fever was epidemic and left in health &s;carcely a number of per&s;ons &s;ufficient to tend the &s;ick. The u&s;ual forms of burial were neglected, and dead bodies were thrown into graves in piles. A &s;evere winter put a &s;top to this epidemic. Brompton, with a natural partiality for religious hou&s;es, informs us that the only places exempted from the de&s;truction of this pe&s;tilence, were the mona&s;teries&mdash;Cotem|porary with this di&s;ea&s;e was an earthquake and a &s;ingular fiery appearance in the &s;ky.

<P>The winter of 1200 was cold; the &s;ummer of 1201 was very rainy; and the winter &s;ucceeding was &s;evere almo&s;t beyond example. In 1203 was a &s;ore famin from bad &s;ea&s;ons. In 1205 a rigorous winter and a great hail &s;torm; in 1206 an erup|tion of Heckla; but I have no account of any epidemics that prevailed.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="036687_0130_100AA17AD8F9BCE0">In 1210 was an eruption of Heckla, and a cold winter. In 1211 appeared a comet, in May, vi&s;ible for 18 days. Great tempe&s;ts marked this period with inundations. In 1212 Venice and Dama&s;cus were violently agitated by earthquakes, and in Sicily thou&s;ands peri&s;hed by an inundation. The&s;e phenomena were the heralds of a &s;evere pe&s;tilence, which, in 1213, was &s;o fatal in Italy, that authors affirm &s;carcely one tenth of the in|habitants &s;urvived. In the year following appeared two comets.</P>
<P>The year 1219 was di&s;tingui&s;hed for the approach of a large comet, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing inundations, in one of which peri&s;hed 36,000 inhabitants, an earthquake and a volcanic eruption in Iceland. In 1220 the plague was &s;o fatal in Damietta, that authors re|late three per&s;ons only &s;urvived out of 70,000. By this we are to under&s;tand the di&s;ea&s;e to have been extremely mortal; but we mu&s;t reject the literal meaning of &s;uch relations. It is doubt|le&s;s true that the pe&s;tilence of this period has rarely been ex|ceeded in mortality.</P>
<P>This period was very calamitous in the north of Europe. In 1221 Poland was afflicted by exce&s;&s;ive rains, and the floods which followed &s;wept away whole villages. The winter &s;uc|ceeding was &s;evere, &s;o that frozen wine was &s;old by weight, while famin and pe&s;tilence almo&s;t de&s;olated Europe. In mo&s;t countries, the living could hardly bury the dead; and in &s;ome cities, &s;carcely a per&s;on &s;urvived.</P>
<P>In the year 1222 appeared a comet of unu&s;ual magnitude and the &s;ummer was exce&s;&s;ively dry. A fro&s;t, with deep &s;now in April, de&s;troyed the fruits. In autumn the earth was deluged with rains and &s;wept with violent winds. An earthquake &s;hook Germany and Lombardy; in Cyprus two cities were demoli&s;hed; the &s;hocks were frequent and continued for two months, in Brixia, Venice, England and other countries. The plague raged, for three years, with uncontrolable fury, in Germany, Hungary, France and other countries; falling on cattle as well as man.</P>
<P>During this dreadful period, the di&s;charges of fire and lava, from the volcanoes in Iceland, exceeded what had been before known in the &s;ame &s;pace of time. There were two eruptions in
<PB N="127" REF="036687_0131_100AA17CDC66A140">
1222, one from Heckla; the other from Reikene&s;e; and the eruptions of the latter were repeated in 1223, 1225 and 1226. In 1224 was a &s;evere drouth; in 1225 a rigorous winter, fol|lowed by a dearth, and mortal di&s;ea&s;es among &s;heep.</P>
<P>Let any candid man ob&s;erve the natural phenomena accompa|nying this de&s;olating period, from 1219 to 1226; and decide for him&s;elf how far the fire or electricity of the &s;y&s;tem is an agent in producing them, and the attending di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erve here the progre&s;s of pe&s;tilence to be the &s;ame as in modern times. The plague appeared in Egypt almo&s;t at the &s;ame time with the comet, and fir&s;t derangement of the elements in 1219 and 1220; but was two, three, four and five years later in the high northern latitudes.</P>
<P>No comet is mentioned in the hi&s;tories of this dark period, as far as I can find, from 1222 to 1240; but that there was one, in the vicinity of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rth, between 1228 and 1233, is very probable.</P>
<P>In 1228 an inundation in Frie&s;land demoli&s;hed whole towns, and it was e&s;timated that 100,000 people peri&s;hed. Great rains in &s;ummer and exce&s;&s;ive heat were followed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;evere winter, with deep &s;now.</P>
<P>In 1230 the waters of the Tyber ro&s;e to the &s;tairs of St. Peter's Church, and drowned the lower city. July and Augu&s;t were exce&s;&s;ively hot. An inundation of the Danube in 1232, and in 1233 &s;o &s;evere a fro&s;t, that rivers were converted into highways in Italy; and earthquakes marked the year, with a dark day.</P>
<P>During this period from 1230 to 1233, France, Denmark and Italy were wa&s;ted by dreadful famin and plague. The&s;e ca|lamities continued in 1234 and 5, in England and France. In London alone 20,000 people were &s;tarved. Worms and locu&s;ts devoured the fruits of the earth.</P>
<P>The winter of 1236 was rainy&mdash;the following &s;ummer ex|tremely dry, and in England mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing agues were ep|idemic. In 1237 was an eruption of a volcano in Iceland.</P>
<P>In 1239 pe&s;tilence again raged&mdash;a new &s;tar, like Lucifer appeared. Famin was &s;o &s;evere that per&s;ons fed on human fle&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="036687_0132_100A89A661F37B88">In 1240 a comet appeared in Feb. and was vi&s;ible a month.

The cau&s;e to which this phenomenon is a&s;&s;igned is laughable enough; but the fact is important; for it &s;trengthens modern ob&s;ervations, that when pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es prevail on the &s;urface of the earth, fi&s;h often peri&s;h beneath the water. Of this no doubt can re|main; and this alone demon&s;trates that the <HI>pe&s;tilential cau&s;e</HI> is as powerful or nearly &s;o, at the bottom of rivers and the ocean, as on the earth&mdash;a fact that reduces the theory of propagating the fomes of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es in ve&s;&s;els, clothes and &s;imilar articles, from one country to another, to a thing of very trifling con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The winter of 1240 was very &s;evere&mdash;the &s;now was deep and cattle peri&s;hed. An eruption of fire in Iceland is noted the &s;ame year.</P>
<P>In 1242 the Thames ro&s;e by means of exce&s;&s;ive rains and overwhelmed the country for &s;ix miles about Lambeth. The years 1243 and 4 were remarkable for continued drouth, mete|ors and a mo&s;t fatal plague.&mdash;An eruption of fire in Iceland in 1245.</P>
<P>In 1247 a violent earthquake was experienced in England, and in September a fatal plague. The earthquake was in Feb|ruary and followed by a very rainy &s;ummer. The winter fol|lowing was &s;o mild, that people wore their &s;ummer clothes; but from March to May was cold.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer of 1250 was rainy and tempe&s;tuous, followed by a hard winter. The &s;ummer of 1251 was intolerably hot, and epidemic di&s;ea&s;es prevailed, with great mortality.</P>

the winter, and cea&s;ing about the time, in the hot &s;ea&s;on, when that di&s;ea&s;e u&s;ually begins.</P>
<P>The winter of 1254 was rigorou&s;ly cold, a murrain among &s;heep was very fatal, and in England and France a mortal di&s;|temper among hor&s;es called the <HI>evil of the tongue,</HI> but it is not de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>In 1255 appeared a comet; tides ro&s;e to an uncommon height; rivers &s;welled with exce&s;&s;ive rains and tempe&s;ts levelled buildings. In 1256 the rains and tempe&s;ts were equally violent, and another comet appeared. In 1257 the &s;ummer was al&s;o exce&s;&s;ively rai|ny. From the&s;e rains came a dearth of corn in England and France in 1258, which was al&s;o rainy; and famin and di&s;ea&s;es made havoc with human life. Fifteen thou&s;and per&s;ons peri&s;hed by hunger in London; but I have no account that the plague prevailed at that time.</P>
<P>To this &s;eries of wet &s;ea&s;ons &s;ucceeded &s;evere drouth in 1259 and 1260; and the mortality continued till the &s;ummer of 1259 &mdash;after which plenty &s;ucceeded to want.</P>
<P>The year 1261 was rainy in England and Scotland, and a dearth was the con&s;equence in the following year.</P>
<P>In 1262 an eruption of a volcano in Iceland.</P>
<P>In 1263 a &s;evere fro&s;t in winter converted the Thames into a highway for men and hor&s;es. In 1264 a comet was vi&s;ible from June 20th to September 28th and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es &s;wept away hor&s;es and cattle.</P>
<P>In 1266 &s;warms of Palmer worms devoured all vegetables in Scotland, and &s;everal villages on the Tay and Froth were &s;wept away by floods. The&s;e were preceded by a remarkable halo.</P>
<P>In 1268 appeared a comet, and violent tempe&s;ts and rain are noted, together with &s;terility of grain and dearth in Au&s;tria and Sicily.</P>
<P>In 1269 the winter was extremely &s;evere; hor&s;es and car|riages pa&s;&s;ing on the ice over the Thames. A plague raged among the Cru&s;aders, on their march to the holy land, of which died the French king and his &s;on.

<P>Hi&s;torians fix upon the year 1277 for the formation of the Dollert Sea, between Groningen and Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land, by a great inundation, which overwhelmed 33 villages irrecoverably; with many farm-hou&s;es in the open country.</P>
<P>In 1280 a great inundation was followed by a very cold win|ter. In 1281 Poland was afflicted with famin.

The year 1285 was noted for a &s;imilar darkne&s;s, mo&s;t parching drouth and the commencement of a famin in England.</P>
<P>This drouth was followed in 1286, by the approach of a comet. In this year, Pru&s;&s;ia was infe&s;ted with a new &s;pecies of worms, who&s;e &s;ting was poi&s;onous. Swarms of flies and pe&s;ti|lential fevers in Spain nearly de&s;troyed the army of the French king, then making war on Arragon.</P>

<P>It is po&s;&s;ible however that the&s;e authors may refer to the com|mencement of the di&s;ea&s;e in different parts of England.</P>
<P>This formidable calamity de&s;erves a particular de&s;cription, with all the phenomena attending it.</P>
<P>In 1347 appeared a frightful comet, in Augu&s;t. Preceding and during the prevalence of the di&s;ea&s;e, the whole earth was &s;haken by mo&s;t tremendous earthquakes. All Germany was &s;haken in 1346. In 1349 on the 9th of Sept. Sicily was &s;haken to its foundation, together with all Italy. In Greece many cities were overthrown, and in many places towns and ca&s;tles were demoli&s;hed. Thou&s;ands of people were &s;wallowed up and the cour&s;es of rivers were ob&s;tructed.</P>
<P>Over Avignon was &s;u&s;pended a meteor or pillar of fire for an hour. The heavens were at times illuminated as with flame, and meteors were frequent.</P>
<P>I have no particular de&s;cription of all the &s;ea&s;ons, during the five years, in which this mortal pe&s;tilence de&s;olated Europe.

its appearance, and whether before or after the other forms of this pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>Mezeray relates that in China, the di&s;ea&s;e originated from a vapor, which bur&s;t from the earth, was horribly offen&s;ive and con&s;umed the face of the country through an extent of 200 leagues. This account may be inaccurate, but is not to be wholly rejected. That &s;ome action of &s;ubterranean heat was in&s;trumental in generating the di&s;ea&s;e, is very probable; or at lea&s;t that &s;ome phenomena of fire accompanied it, becau&s;e this &s;uppo&s;ition is con&s;onant to the whole &s;eries of modern ob&s;erva|tions.</P>
<P>The pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air, in that period, is &s;trongly marked by the appearance of myriads of unu&s;ual and loath&s;ome in&s;ects, not only in China, but in Europe. They are de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> as young &s;erpents, or as venemous in&s;ects, or as large vermin with tails and eight &s;hort legs&mdash;in which de&s;cription, probably, a frightened imagination had &s;ome &s;hare of infl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nce.

<P>In the Ou&s;e there was a great inundation ju&s;t before A&s;cen|&s;ion day, and in York began this plague &s;peedily after the flood.</P>
<P>The &s;ymptoms of this fatal malady were&mdash;violent af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ction in the head and &s;tomach, buboes and other glandular &s;wellings; &s;mall &s;wellings like pimples or bli&s;ters; u&s;ually a feve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a vomiting or &s;pitting of blood.&mdash;The &s;wellings in the glands&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e infallible &s;igns of the di&s;ea&s;e; but the mo&s;t fatal &s;ymptom was, the pimples or bli&s;ters &s;pread over the whole body. Hemorrha|ges from the mouth, no&s;e and other parts, indicated a univer&s;al and &s;udden di&s;organization of the blood. The patient u&s;ually died in three days or le&s;s&mdash;which denotes the virulence of the poi&s;on, or rather the activity of the di&s;ea&s;e, which de&s;troyed the powers of life in half the time, which the bilious plague u&s;ually employs.</P>
<P>The peripneumony which was epidemic about the &s;ame time, appeared in a burning fever, in&s;atiable thir&s;t, a black tongue, anxiety and pains about the heart, &s;hort breath, a cough with expectoration of a mixed matter, open mouth, raging delirium, fury, red, turbid or black urine, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and watchings,

black eruptions, anthraces, buboes, and in &s;ome, corroding ulcers over the whole body. The di&s;ea&s;e u&s;ually terminated the 4th day, &s;ometimes not till the 7th. The blood was black and thick; but &s;ometimes greeni&s;h and watery or yellowi&s;h.&mdash;Vene&s;ection was certain death. The di&s;ea&s;e baffled medical &s;kill&mdash;the only remedies that appeared to relieve, were laxatives early admin|i&s;tered, cupping and &s;carification, leeches applied to the hemor|rhoids, and inwardly, infu&s;ions of mild, diaphoretic, attenua|ting, pectoral vegetables.</P>
<P>It will be hereafter proved that malignant pleuri&s;y and peripneu|mony u&s;ually form a part of that &s;eries of di&s;ea&s;es which always occur during a period of general contagion. When plague and yellow fever occur in <HI>&s;ummer,</HI> in northern climates, pleuri&s;y and peripneumony often a&s;&s;ume, in <HI>winter,</HI> great and even pe&s;tilential violence.</P>
<P>This plague was &s;o deadly that at lea&s;t half or two thirds of the human race peri&s;hed in about 8 years. It was mo&s;t fatal in cities, but in no place died le&s;s than a third of the inhabitants. In many cities peri&s;hed nine out of ten of the people, and many places were wholly depopulated. In London 50,000 dead bod|ies were buried in one grave yard. In Norwich died about the &s;ame number. In Venice died 100,000&mdash;in Lubec, 90,000&mdash; in Florence the &s;ame number. In the ea&s;t peri&s;hed twenty mil|lions in one year.&mdash;In Spain the di&s;ea&s;e raged three years and carried off two thirds of the people. Alfon&s;o 2d. died with it while be&s;ieging Gibraltar.</P>
<P>In this fatal period, the apprehen&s;ion of death de&s;troyed the value of property. In England, and probably in other coun|tries, cattle were neglected and they ran at large over the coun|try. The corn peri&s;hed in the fields for want of reapers; whole vill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ges were depopulated; and after the malady cea&s;ed, multi|tudes of hou&s;es and buildings of all kinds were &s;een mouldering to ruin. A hor&s;e which before had been worth forty &s;hillings, after the &s;ickne&s;s, &s;old for half a mark.</P>
<P>Altho in the year preceding there had been a plenty of pro|vi&s;ions, yet the neglect of agriculture during the general di&s;tre&s;s produced a famin. Such was the lo&s;s of laborers, that the few

&s;urvivors afterwards demanded exorbitant wages, and the Par|liament of England was obliged to interfere, and limit their wa|ges, and even compel men to labor.&mdash;See 23d Edward 3. A. D. 1350. The preamble &s;tates, that a great part of the people, e&s;pecially workmen and &s;ervants had died of the late pe&s;tilence, and tho&s;e who &s;urvived, &s;eeing the nece&s;&s;ity of men, demanded exce&s;&s;ive wages.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e was particularly fatal in Denmark&mdash;all bu&s;ine&s;s was at a &s;tand, towns were de&s;erted, and all was terror and de&s;|pair. It reached the highe&s;t northern latitudes; it broke out in Iceland, and was &s;o fatal, that the &s;ettlements there are &s;up|po&s;ed not to have &s;ince recovered their population. It was cal|led the <HI>&s;orte diod,</HI> black death.</P>
<P>In &s;ome places people attempted to e&s;cape infection by taking their families on board of ve&s;&s;els, and putting to &s;ea; but it was in vain; they were &s;eized in every place, without regard to age or &s;ex.</P>
<P>In 1348 the malady &s;wept away the Greenland merchants and &s;eamen. This di&s;ea&s;e al&s;o, or &s;ome other cau&s;e de&s;troyed the colony of Danes in that country, for it was extingui&s;hed and has never been found or heard of to this day.</P>
<P>This pe&s;tilence was remarkably fatal to the monks and regular clergy of all de&s;criptions. In one &s;ociety at Montpeliers, of 140 members died all but 7: About the &s;ame proportion peri&s;hed in Magdalen Society. In Mar&s;eilles, of 140 not one &s;urvived. But a circum&s;tance related in Knighton's Chronicon de&s;erves particular notice. At Avignon where the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appeared in France, 66 of the Carmelites had died, before the citizens were apprized of the fact; and when it was di&s;covered, the re|port circulated that the brethren had killed each other.</P>
<P>An important con&s;equence re&s;ults from the fact&mdash;that this plague fir&s;t appeared in a mona&s;tery, which might be crouded with lazy, idle, filthy monks; in a city not commercial, nor a &s;ea port. There was no idea of any imported infection; but there mu&s;t have been &s;trong <HI>local</HI> cau&s;es, which fir&s;t excited into action the general contagion which, at that time, pervaded the atmo&s;phere over the whole globe.</P>
<P>Such was the havoc made by this pe&s;tilence among the clergy
<PB N="139" REF="036687_0143_100AA193B0819270">
in England, &s;ays Knighton, that a vicarage which before the plague, might have been &s;upplied for four or five marks a year, or two marks and the man's board, was rai&s;ed to the price of twen|ty marks or twenty pounds.</P>

<P>This pe&s;tilential period was preceded and attended with all the u&s;ual phenomena of fatal Epidemics.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Except eruptions of volcanoes, of which I have no account, at this period except in Iceland in 1340. But my accounts of volcanoes are very imperfect.</NOTE> The earthquakes and the in&s;ects have been noticed. Abortions were among the remarka|ble precur&s;ors of this malady. The &s;ame fact is noticed by Diemerbroeck, before the great plague at Nimeguen, in 1635. The &s;ame has been mentioned by the authors he quoted, Fore&s;|tus, Sennertes, and others; and is a&s;cribed to the tenderne&s;s and debility of the heart and Vi&s;cera.

<P>Another phenomenon attending this plague was the <HI>death of fi&s;h.</HI> This circum&s;tance, with the bad &s;tate of the water, which is often affected by the pe&s;tilential &s;tate of the elements, and was greatly affected in this period, gave ri&s;e to a report that the Jews had poi&s;oned the wells and &s;prings. The prejudices again&s;t the Jews, which have marked and &s;candalized all chri&s;tian coun|tries, except America, were at their height in the reign of Ed|ward the 3d of England, the period under con&s;ideration. The&s;e prejudices drove legi&s;lators and princes to exerci&s;e every &s;pecies of cruelty upon the I&s;raelites, on account of their u&s;ury; and when the report of their poi&s;oning the water circulated, the pop|ulace in &s;ome places and e&s;pecially in Germany, ro&s;e and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated multitudes of the&s;e unfortunate men.</P>
<P>The death of animals, particularly of &s;heep, marked the &s;ame period. In England, 5000 died in one pa&s;ture. The &s;tate of the air and water was &s;o pe&s;tilential that it is averred by hi&s;torians, the fowls and fi&s;hes had blotches on them.</P>

<P>This pe&s;tilence al&s;o became nearly general.

<P><PB N="146" REF="036687_0150_100AA1A235FF70C8">It will be ob&s;erved, in this period and in many others, that the plague is not mentioned under the year of the earthquake. Modern ob&s;ervations explain the progre&s;s of pe&s;tilence, which is mo&s;t u&s;ual, viz. mea&s;les, catarrh, angina, and other malig|nant complaints <HI>preceding</HI> the cri&s;is of the pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air, or plague. And we find almo&s;t invariably &s;ome of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es to be epidemic, even <HI>before</HI> the comet, earthquakes and erup|tions of volcanoes, altho the mo&s;t violent form of the pe&s;tilence does not always appear till a year or two <HI>after</HI> tho&s;e phenomena. There is al&s;o a difference, in the times of the appearance of the plague in various countries. In Egypt, the pe&s;tilence u&s;ually ap|pears fir&s;t, and is cotemporary with the comet, or nearly &s;o; and the &s;ame year, when the plague rages in Egypt, we find an|ginas and other malignant di&s;ea&s;es prevailing in Europe and America, in northern latitudes. This difference in time evin|ces the power of local cau&s;es, in aiding the progre&s;s of the epi|demic con&s;titution of air, and which produce the mo&s;t violent di&s;ea&s;es in Egypt, one, two or three years, previous to their ap|pearance in cooler latitudes. But it will almo&s;t always be found true, that the commencement of a &s;eries of epidemics is nearly at the &s;ame time in all parts of the world; the precur&s;ors of the plague being nearly cotemporary in different countries; altho the pe&s;tilential con&s;titution or general contagion arrives to its cri&s;is much &s;ooner in Egypt, Smyrna and Con&s;tantinople, than in places le&s;s expo&s;ed to the influence of local cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<P>In 1471 the winter was rigorous and &s;tormy. In 1472 ap|peared three comets; two of them of di&s;tingui&s;hed magnitude. In 1473 mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive heat and drouth, and authors relate that

<P>The&s;e phenomena, in this period, as u&s;ual, introduced mo&s;t terrible pe&s;tilence, which began in 1472 and arrived to its height in 1477. It raged in Italy, Germany, France and England, and how much more exten&s;ively, my authorities do not inform me. It prevailed &s;everal years, with incredible mortality. In Paris peri&s;hed 40,000; a large number for the population at that time. In England the number of deaths was not e&s;timated; but authors relate that fifteen years of civil war did not carry off one third of the number. This year 1477 was exce&s;&s;ively hot.

It may be laid down as an axiom, on this &s;ubject, that altho the appearance of this fever is not <HI>always</HI> and <HI>certainly</HI> followed by the plague, yet that the plague, in mo&s;t parts of the ea&s;t, is <HI>always</HI> preceded by a petechial fever.</P>

<P>In 1541 the plague raged in Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>The year 1543 was very wet and cold, and a great mortality among cattle. In 1542 the plague was in Geneva. In 1543 it raged in London in winter. In 1545 there was an eruption of Etna. The plague again raged in Geneva, and all over Eu|rope a pe&s;tilential epidemic, called the Troup Gallant, which &s;eized chiefly the young and robu&s;t, with a mortality nearly equal to that of the true plague, of which it &s;eems to have been the precur&s;or. Patients had a violent pain in the head, heat in the kidneys, univer&s;al la&s;&s;itude, continual watchings ending in frenzy, or drowzine&s;s ending in lethargy; and worms ri&s;ing into the throat, with danger of &s;uffocation. Bleeding was the only remedy; then detergents and cordials. The di&s;ea&s;e terminated on the 4th or 11th day. Charles, duke of Orleans, died of this di&s;ea&s;e at a mona&s;tery in Abbeville.</P>
<P>In 1547 the plague prevailed in mo&s;t parts of Europe, as in Ireland and in Germany; and in 1548 in London.

<P>This pe&s;tilential period was long and &s;evere. In 1548 the plague was in London. A contagious peripneumony prevailed over Europe, with &s;pitting of blood and difficulty of breathing. In 1549 the plague prevailed in Pru&s;&s;ia and Portugal.</P>
<P>In 1550 a comet in March, and the &s;ame year an eruption of Etna and Lipari. The &s;ummer was very rainy and the win|ter dry. In 1551 the earth was deluged with rain, and infinite damage was done by floods. The catarrh was epidemic in France. An epidemic pe&s;tilential fever raged all over Europe, and the &s;weating &s;ickne&s;s in London. The plague followed in various parts of Europe. In 1552 it raged in Mi&s;ena, and the patient di&s;charged blood by the pores for three days before death. In 1553 the &s;ame di&s;temper raged in Paris, with extreme mor|tality, and to appea&s;e the wrath of heaven, many heretics were burnt.</P>

This di&s;ea&s;e was preceded by meteors in the air, and attended with abortions. Such was the mortality, that the poor fought for coffins for their dead relations. In Delph only, died 5000 of the poor. It continued through the winter to May 1558.</P>

<P>In de Thou's hi&s;tory of his own times, vol. 2. 227, we have an account of the &s;potted, or petechial fever, which appeared in Spain in 1557, which was nearly as mortal as the inguinal plague. He calls it a "new di&s;ea&s;e" and unknown to the an|cients. The &s;pots differed from the florid pimples of the purple fever. It was putrid, malignant and much re&s;embling the plague, but "did not carry &s;o pe&s;tilent a contagiou&s;ne&s;s." It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as called in Spain the "puncticular di&s;ea&s;e." Innumerable people peri&s;hed by it that year.

<P>In 1562 and 3 the plague &s;pread over Europe. It broke out in 1562 among the Engli&s;h &s;oldiers, who were &s;ent to garri&s;on New-Haven in France. The next year it raged in London and carried off 20,000 of its inhabitants. Authors &s;ay, the &s;old|iers from New-Haven introduced it into London; but who in|troduced it into New-Haven, we are not informed.</P>
<P>The truth is, this terrible di&s;ea&s;e appeared in mo&s;t parts of Europe about the &s;ame time. In Frankfort, Nuremberg, Mag|deburgh, Hamburgh, Dantzick, and in the vandalic maritime towns, Wi&s;mar, Lubick, Ro&s;tock and others, peri&s;hed by com|putation 300,000 per&s;ons in the year 1563.&mdash;This di&s;ea&s;e al&s;o raged in winter, for Thuanus mentions the death of Ca&s;talion, a literary character of that age, by the plague at Ba&s;le in January.</P>
<P>This year was remarkable al&s;o for earthquakes. In Sept. was a violent one in England, e&s;pecially in Lincoln and other northern parts. In January the river Thames was agitated by preternatural fluxes of the tides, which forced back the natural tides, three times. In winter, &s;evere cold rendered that river pa&s;&s;able as a highway.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year earthquakes were felt in Illyrica, and Dalma|tia, and Catana &s;uffered a great lo&s;s of lives.</P>
<P>In 1564 a comet appeared, and remarkable northern lights, or meteors, and a de&s;tructive inundation of the Thames.</P>

<P>In 1566 the &s;pring was rainy and the harve&s;t dry. The Hungarian fever broke out in the Emperor Maximilian's army, and as authors affirm, the &s;oldiers, when di&s;banded, &s;pread it all over Europe, with great mortality. This di&s;ea&s;e invaded the patient at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, with &s;light cold and &s;hiver|ering for about fifteen minutes. This was followed by inten&s;e heat, and intolerable pain in the head, mouth and &s;tomach, &s;o that the &s;lighte&s;t touch of the bed clothes, made the &s;ick utter &s;hrieks: The pain in the mouth and &s;tomach being the pathog|nomonic &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;The thir&s;t was unquencha|ble, and a longing for wine, which was fatal, if taken.

<P>In the year 1567 was an eruption of Etna, and in Tercera, one of the Azores, fire bur&s;t from a lake on the top of a hill, and the water relea&s;ed from its bed, ru&s;hed down and &s;wept away part of a &s;ettlement below. In 1568 a &s;potted fever raged in Paris, in which pro&s;tration of &s;trength rendered bleeding fatal. The winter of 1567 was very &s;evere, and the &s;ummer exce&s;&s;ively dry.</P>
<P>In 1569 appeared a comet.&mdash;The &s;potted fever in this year became epidemic in Europe, raging for three years with great de&s;truction. The plague was in London.

<P>Thuanus, who&s;e authority is very re&s;pectable, and who was cotemporary with this period, relates that in 1570 the dikes in Holland were broken by a &s;well of the ocean, and that 400,000 people were overwhelmed in the floods. He &s;ays further that &s;imilar phenomena were ob&s;erved, that year, in different places over the whole world. Reggio, Florence, Venice and Modena felt &s;evere &s;hocks of earthquake in 1571, and Ferara was laid in ruins.</P>
<P>The &s;ummers of 1570 and 71 were moi&s;t and warm; and in gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al the &s;ea&s;ons were &s;imilar for the two &s;ucceeding years. The winters were rigorous. Fluxes, mea&s;les, worms and &s;emi|tertians were epidemic in many places. In 1572 appeared a comet or new &s;tar, very bright and clear, larger than Jupiter, in the con&s;tellation of Ca&s;&s;iopeia, behind her chair. It was &s;tationary for 16 months and by degrees evani&s;hed. The winter &s;ucceding was remarkable for hard fro&s;t and deep &s;now.

<P>This year the plague raged in Poland; and at Ba&s;le a malig|nant fever, chiefly fatal to men of robu&s;t con&s;titution.</P>
<P>In 1574 the petechial fever, which had &s;pread mortality over Europe, e&s;pecially in Italy and Spain, began to change into the u&s;ual form of the plague. This di&s;ea&s;e made its appearance in London, in a &s;mall degree, in October and November of this year.</P>
<P>In 1575 the plague appeared in many parts of Europe, and

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ged with incredible mortality for three years. It was reported in Italy to have been <HI>imported</HI> into Verona and Venice, from Trent. Such was the current vulgar opinion. But men of &s;ci|ence hold the di&s;ea&s;e to be generated in cities from the <HI>filthine&s;s of private dwellings,</HI> and not to be produced by the po&s;ition of the &s;tars or malignant con&s;titution of the air.</P>
<P>The truth was, the di&s;ea&s;e in Italy fir&s;t appeared in Trent, an <HI>inland town, far from the &s;ea</HI>&mdash;another in&s;tance in which the advocates of importation from Africa or the Levant are &s;ilenced. Philo&s;ophy di&s;dains to look abroad for the cau&s;e of an epidemic, when the &s;tronge&s;t of all cau&s;es exi&s;t in the place. Trent is &s;ituated in a valley, on the bank of the Adige, a river which often overflows the adjacent low lands; and after the flood re|cedes, the place is &s;ometimes &s;o &s;ickly that the people are com|pelled to retire to the neighboring hills. Strong local cau&s;es therefore account for the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> appearance of the plague in that city. The general contagion of the atmo&s;phere, which had produced &s;potted fevers and other deadly di&s;ea&s;es all over Eu|rope for four years preceding, was aided by the local unhealthi|ne&s;s of Trent, and here appeared fir&s;t, the cri&s;is of the pe&s;ti|lence, or plague. See the de&s;cription of that country in Zim|merman on Air.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e almo&s;t depopulated Trent in 1575, and became mortal in the neighboring Venetian territories. This mortality however was only the forerunner of greater evils. The di&s;ea&s;e indeed &s;ub&s;ided in winter, and the people &s;uppo&s;ed its violence to be pa&s;t. They might have known otherwi&s;e, had they atten|ded to the <HI>progre&s;&s;ivene&s;s</HI> of the malady, and the certain indi|cations of its increa&s;e.</P>
<P>In 1576 the di&s;ea&s;e appeared in Venice; and as it carried off a few people at fir&s;t, in &s;cattered &s;ituations, opinions were, as u&s;ual in all &s;uch ca&s;es, divided as to the nature of the di&s;tem|per. In this &s;tate of the public mind, two eminent phy&s;icians, Mercuriale of Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">li, and Capavacca of Padua, undertook to a&s;&s;ert the di&s;ea&s;e not to be pe&s;tilential. The &s;enate, ob&s;erving the controver&s;y among the Venetian phy&s;icians, as to the nature of the di&s;temper, li&s;tened to the two foreigners, who declared
<PB N="161" REF="036687_0165_100AA1C1615C40B0">
they could cure it, and put a &s;top to the removal of the di&s;ea&s;ed from the city. By this means, &s;ays the hi&s;torian, the di&s;temper was obviou&s;ly increa&s;ed; and it raged with terrible fury, till it carried off 70,000 of the citizens, with fifty-&s;even valuable phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons. The two foreign phy&s;icians were di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, with applau&s;es for having preferred the good of Venice to their per&s;onal &s;afety.</P>
<P>This account from Thuanus de&s;erves particular notice. We here &s;ee the &s;ame doubts about the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e on its fir&s;t appearance, which prevail in all &s;imilar ca&s;es&mdash;as in Mar|&s;eilles in 1720&mdash;in London in 1665&mdash;and in America, with re&s;pect to the yellow fever, which is only another form of plague. The &s;ource of all the&s;e doubts and controver&s;ies, which have &s;o often embarra&s;&s;ed the citizens and di&s;graced the faculty, is, the <HI>progre&s;&s;ivene&s;s</HI> of the pe&s;tilence. The malignant di&s;ea&s;es preceding, &s;lide into the glandular plague &s;o gradually, that phy|&s;icians them&s;elves do not know preci&s;ely when the di&s;temper &s;hould lo&s;e the name of <HI>malignant fever</HI> and take that of <HI>plague.</HI> Sydenham hone&s;tly confe&s;&s;es that, in 1665, he did not know whether the malignant di&s;ea&s;e which appeared in May and be|came epidemic, ju&s;t before the plague, was the real plague or not. And the truth is, that the di&s;ea&s;e often a&s;&s;ails people, in a few &s;cattering ca&s;es, at the beginning of a plague, with a mor|tality equal to the true pe&s;tis, and <HI>without</HI> the di&s;tinctive marks of plague, the glandular tumors.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts will hereafter, with careful ob&s;ervation, obviate all controver&s;ies at the beginning of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es; and they will decide infallibly all que&s;tions relative to the dome&s;tic or foreign origin of &s;uch maladies.</P>
<P>This pe&s;tilence was &s;everely felt in Padua, Milan, Cremona and Pavia. Vicenza, which e&s;caped this year, was vi&s;ited the next, with equal &s;everity.</P>
<P>Dr. Mead is puzzled to know why Vicenza, which lies be|tween Verona and Padua, &s;hould e&s;cape the plague, in the year when both tho&s;e cities were infe&s;ted; and yet the next year, &s;hould &s;uffer equally with her neighbors, when <HI>they</HI> were exempt from the calamity.

the conveyance of the <HI>infection</HI> from one to another, without communicating it to the intervening city. This &s;ubject will be con&s;idered in a &s;ub&s;equent &s;ection; I will only here remark, that nothing is &s;o fatal to truth and &s;cience, as for a man of popular talents to e&s;pou&s;e an erroneous theory, and then &s;trive to bend facts to its &s;upport.</P>

<P>This &s;udden cata&s;trophe is a&s;cribed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o a damp or vapor. But there is no need of re&s;orting to &s;uch a cau&s;e. The atmo&s;phere, during the period under con&s;ideration, was not furni&s;hed with the power of &s;upporting animal life, in as ample a manner as it u&s;ually is.&mdash;This is evident, from the univer&s;ality of mortal epi|demics. In this &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, a multitude, crouded into a court room, in the hot month of July, mu&s;t &s;peedily de&s;|troy all the re&s;pirable air, and death mu&s;t en&s;ue. That the prin|cipal cau&s;e was not only local, but &s;udden, is demon&s;trated by the circum&s;tance, that no infection accompanied the di&s;ea&s;ed. Had the cau&s;e of their illne&s;s been long in operation, it would have produced in the body that &s;pecies of poi&s;on, which is nox|ious to per&s;ons in health. Per&s;ons, &s;uddenly deprived of life, as by damps in wells or the fumes of charcoal, communicate no infection.</P>
<P>It is &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome writers, that this di&s;ea&s;e was occa&s;ion|ed by an infected pri&s;oner, who was brought from jail into court; but Stowe does not mention this circum&s;tance. And it is po&s;&s;ible the cata&s;trophe might have been owing to a &s;udden di&s;charge of mephitic vapor.</P>
<P>Scarcely had the la&s;t period of pe&s;tilence come to a clo&s;e, when another &s;eries of maladies &s;ucceeded, and nearly in the or|der of tho&s;e la&s;t de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>In 1580 appeared a comet on the 10th of October which was vi&s;ible for two months. The preceding &s;ummer was very moi&s;t and rainy, and about the ri&s;ing of the dog-&s;tar, came on a cold dry north wind. In June began an epidemic catarrh in Sicily, which &s;pread over Europe. In July, it was in Italy; in Au|gu&s;t, in Venice and Con&s;tantinople; in September, it extended over Hungary, Bohemia and Saxony; in October, on the Bal|tic;
<PB N="164" REF="036687_0168_100AA1C86CAF0E70">
in November, in Norway and in December, in Sweden, Poland and Ru&s;&s;ia.&mdash;Its &s;ymptoms were nearly the &s;ame, as in this country, but the di&s;ea&s;e was more violent and fatal.&mdash;In Rome, died of it 4000 people&mdash;in Lubec, 8000; at Ham|burgh, 3000; and multitudes in other places. It appears to have been attended with more fever than in ordinary ca&s;es&mdash;The fever was continual for four or five days, with a pain in the head, &s;traitne&s;s of the brea&s;t and cough&mdash;it terminated in profu&s;e &s;weating.&mdash;In general bleeding and purging were found to be prejudicial.</P>
<BIBL>Riverius, lib. 17.</BIBL>
<P>In this year and about the time, when the catarrh had over|&s;pread Europe, broke out in Grand Cairo, one of the mo&s;t de&s;|olating plagues ever known. Pro&s;per Alpinus, who lived in that age, reports the number of deaths, from November 1580, to July 1581 to have been 500,000. It will be found on ex|amination that the plague, in a &s;eries of pe&s;tilential and epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, appears in Egypt, <HI>before</HI> it does in Europe and Amer|ica, and is nearly cotemporary with the catarrh, angina or other precur&s;or of the pe&s;tilence in more northern latitudes. This fact de&s;erves notice. The plague which followed the catarrh in Europe, did not appear in many places, perhaps in none except in France, in the year 1580.&mdash;In northern latitudes, the malig|nity of the epidemic con&s;titution does not appear, till the &s;econd or third year, after its commencement in catarrh or mea&s;les.</P>
<P>In Paris however the plague raged in 1580, the &s;ame year it appeared in Egypt, and carried off 40,000 people, mo&s;tly of the poorer &s;ort; and at the &s;ame time, it prevailed in many of the neighboring towns, e&s;pecially, &s;ays Thuanus, "at Laon in Vermandois, which city is in a po&s;ition expo&s;ed to a hot &s;un, in which died 6000."</P>
<P>The hi&s;torian further remarks, that the "crops that year were plentiful, and the &s;ky &s;erene; &s;o that it was thought the di&s;ea&s;e was produced rather by the influence of the &s;tars, ab a&s;trorum impre&s;&s;ione, than by the malignity of a corrupt air." This is another proof that a &s;tate of air, as de&s;cribed by Hip|pocrates, is not always the cau&s;e of pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="036687_0169_100AA1CCA6F24A88">Altho this malady broke out in France in 1580, yet it had been preceeded by the catarrh. The hi&s;torian remarks, that the catarrh was not &s;o much dreaded for its mortality, tho many died of it, as for the a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity with which the contagion &s;pread from place to place. It &s;eized the lower &s;pine of the back with a chill, <HI>horrore;</HI> to this &s;ucceeded <HI>gravedo,</HI> a dull pain in the head; and univer&s;al languor or debility, re&s;olvens membra, loo&s;ening or unhinging the joints.

<P>In 1580 con&s;iderable earthquakes were felt in Belgium, at Cologne and about the Mediterranean. The &s;ame &s;hocks were felt in various parts of England, but Short places them under the following year. The German &s;ea was agitated, and a great &s;wel|ling of its waters was ob&s;erved.</P>

<P>In 1580 al&s;o, the mar&s;hes in E&s;&s;ex, and &s;ome parts of Kent in England, were laid wa&s;te by mice, which were &s;o numerous as to de&s;troy the herbage, and a murrain among cattle &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>In this year was i&s;&s;ued a proclamation of Queen Elizabeth, upon the repre&s;entation of the Mayor and Aldermen of Lon|don, prohibiting any new hou&s;e to be built within three miles of the gates of the city, and more than one family to re&s;ide in a hou&s;e. The rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for the prohibition are connected with this &s;ubject. The increa&s;e of London had long been con|&s;idered as an evil, by &s;welling the head too large for the body, and &s;everal attempts had been made to re&s;train the increa&s;e. The re&s;ort of people to the city from the country was held to be prejudical to agriculture.</P>
<P>But the proclamation &s;tates further, that "&s;uch great multi|tudes of people, brought to inhabit in &s;mall rooms, whereof a great part are very poor, yea &s;uch as mu&s;t live by begging, or by wor&s;e means, and they heaped together, and in a &s;ort, &s;moth|ered with many families of children and &s;ervants, in one hou&s;e or &s;mall tenement, it mu&s;t needs follow, if any plague or popu|lar &s;ickne&s;s &s;hould, by God's permi&s;&s;ion, enter among&s;t tho&s;e multitudes, that the &s;ame would not only &s;pread it&s;elf, and invade

the whole city and confines, but a great mortality would en&s;ue the &s;ame, and the infection be di&s;per&s;ed through all other parts of the realm."</P>
<P>In this paper, we ob&s;erve &s;ome powerful cau&s;es of pe&s;tilence in London to be explained&mdash;and events &s;howed how little good was done by the interference of authority with private rights, and an attempt to check, by po&s;itive prohibitions, the natural growth of towns. This proclamation, like all which had pre|ceded it, was u&s;ele&s;s. The city increa&s;ed, and the plague con|tinued to ravage it, until the good providence of God arre&s;ted the evil, by a general conflagration, and men had become wi&s;e enough, to build large, airy hou&s;es, and keep them clean.</P>

<P>In 1585 in &s;pring appeared very malignant pleuri&s;ies. In 1586 Thrace was overrun with locu&s;ts, and the plague raged in Hungary, Au&s;tria and Turkey. A comet appeared in each of the&s;e years, and in 1586 Lima in South-America was nearly ruined by an earthquake. See Ulloa, from whom my accounts of earthquakes in Spani&s;h America, are all taken.</P>
<P>In 1587 a very cold &s;pring, but a plentiful year in mo&s;t coun|tries. The plague raged in Flanders, which was almo&s;t depopu|lated by di&s;ea&s;e, war and famin. In &s;ome parts, the wild bea&s;ts took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;es. Dogs ran mad, and did no &s;mall mi&s;chief, and fields were covered with weeds and bu&s;hes. The catarrh appeared in England, this year, but how exten&s;ively, I am not informed. An eruption of fire in Iceland is recorded under the &s;ame year.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="036687_0171_100AA1D092CC60C0">In 1589 the Engli&s;h fleet, returned from <HI>Portugal,</HI> with the <HI>Hungarian</HI> fever, &s;ays Short, and introduced it into England. What an influence have <HI>names,</HI> and what mi&s;chief is done by ignorance and fal&s;e philo&s;ophy! The Hungarian fever! As tho this fever had been a native of a particular &s;oil, and tran&s;planted from country to country, like a fruit-tree. Names are not al|ways harmle&s;s. The name, Sudor <HI>Anglicus,</HI> given to the &s;weat|ing plague, becau&s;e it appeared fir&s;t in England and was at fir&s;t peculiar to Engli&s;hmen, has led the moderns to &s;uppo&s;e, the di&s;|ea&s;e to have been limited to England or to Engli&s;hmen, altho it repeatedly &s;pread over all Europe. In the &s;ame way, the in&s;ect which injures wheat in America, was ignorantly called the He&s;|&s;ian fly, and altho the animal was never known in Germany, yet people believe, that, like yellow fever, it <HI>was imported.</HI> It is thus that ignorance gives currency to an improper name, and the name in turn a&s;&s;i&s;ts to propagate and perpetuate an error.</P>
<P>The truth, in regard to di&s;ea&s;es, is, that they often a&s;&s;ume peculiar &s;ymptoms; &s;uch as are not u&s;ual. The&s;e are not prop|erly <HI>new</HI> di&s;ea&s;es, but modifications of common fever, proceed|ing from the infinite variety of that cau&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s, which I denominate general contagion, and which Sydenham called the Epidemic Con&s;titution of the air. This or other cau&s;es are per|petually diver&s;ifying the &s;ymptoms of di&s;ea&s;es; &s;o that phy&s;icians are often at a lo&s;s whether to call a di&s;ea&s;e by an old or new name. Wherever the peculiar cau&s;es <HI>fir&s;t</HI> exi&s;t, there will the peculiar &s;ymptoms of di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appear&mdash;and when &s;imilar cau&s;es exi&s;t in other places, the &s;ame &s;ymptoms will attend the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In 1590 multitudes of people peri&s;hed by famin. A comet approached the &s;y&s;tem, the winter was cold, a violent earth|quake convul&s;ed Hungary, Bohemia and Vienna; near the lat|ter place, the earth emitted an offen&s;ive &s;mell. The drouth was extreme. The Azores were &s;haken by an earthquake, and a tempe&s;t in September threatened to overwhelm them in ma&s;s.</P>
<P>In 1591 univer&s;al catarrh in Europe was a prelude to mo&s;t de&s;tructive pe&s;tilence. It is &s;ingular al&s;o that the plague broke out in Narva and Revel, in Livonia, on the gulf of Finland, in the 59th degree of latitude, and raged through the &s;ucceeding

cold winter. Six thou&s;and per&s;ons peri&s;hed in Revel. As to its origin, the great Thuanus could not decide whether it was "a belli incommoditatibus, &s;ive caeli inclementia," from the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of war, or intemperature of the air. There could have been no &s;u&s;picion of a foreign origin.</P>
<BIBL>Thuanus, lib. 100.</BIBL>
<P>Cotemporary with the catarrh was a malignant &s;potted fever in Trent. A di&s;tre&s;&s;ing famin cau&s;ed a great mortality in Italy.</P>
<P>In 1591 the plague began to &s;how it&s;elf in Italy, but attended with peculiar &s;ymptoms. A fever, little infectious, &s;eized the head, inducing delirium, and in many patients, was attended with fluxes and flatulent bowels. It terminated fatally on the tenth day. The remedy was bleeding "Secta vena capitis, quae in brachio e&s;t, alii&s;que a capite manantibus," &s;ays Thuanus. It attacked chiefly men between the ages of 30 and 50; but was fatal to few women. It raged in Umbria, Tu&s;cany, Romagne and Lombardy, &s;weeping away, in &s;ome towns, almo&s;t every man. From Augu&s;t to Augu&s;t, it was computed that 60,000 per&s;ons peri&s;hed.</P>

<P>The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, as u&s;ual, were the precur&s;ors of a very di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing plague, which, in the autumn of 1598, raged in Lon|don, Litchfield, Leice&s;ter and other places in England.

<P>THE year 1600 was remarkable for pe&s;tilence in almo&s;t every part of Europe. Spain, where the di&s;ea&s;e was fatal the year before, was this year almo&s;t depopulated. There raged throughout Europe, a pe&s;tilential, mortal cholic which de&s;troyed the lives of all whom it &s;eized, within four days. The patient, as &s;oon as he was &s;eized, became &s;en&s;ele&s;s&mdash;the hair fell from his head&mdash;a livid pu&s;tule aro&s;e on the no&s;e, which con&s;umed it&mdash; the extremities became cold and mortified.</P>
<P>In Florence a terrible earthquake de&s;troyed many buildings.</P>
<P>The winter of 1600 was very cold. In the &s;ummer of 160<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> there was a &s;evere drouth of four or five months; and a violent dy&s;entery followed, with double tertians and continual fevers. The plague raged in Portugal, attended with black round worms. At Chri&s;tmas, there was an earthquake in England. The &s;ame year there was an earthquake at Arequipa, in Peru, accompa|nied by an eruption of a volcano.</P>
<P>In 1602 a cold and dry &s;ummer and winter, the catarrh was epidemic, and acute fevers prevalent. The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es and phe|nomena accompanied a &s;eries of calamities in all parts of Europe.</P>
<P>The famin that marked this period, for a &s;eries of years, ex|ceeded in extent and &s;everity, what had been before recorded. Famins are u&s;ually local; but in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, there was a failure of crops for &s;everal years, in almo&s;t every part of Eu|rope; while the plague committed mo&s;t de&s;olating ravages.</P>
<P>In Mu&s;covy the famin raged for three years at the beginning of the century under con&s;ideration, attended with the plague. Parents devoured their dying children; cats, rats and every un|clean

thing was u&s;ed to &s;u&s;tain life. All the ties of nature and morality were di&s;regarded; human fle&s;h was expo&s;ed to &s;ale in the open market. The more powerful &s;eized their neighbors; fathers and mothers, their children; hu&s;bands, their wives, and offered them for &s;ale. Multitudes of dead were found, with their mouths filled with &s;traw, and the mo&s;t filthy &s;ub&s;tances.

<P>Even in this ca&s;e, the report of imported infection into Lon|don was believed, altho the nation had before their eyes, a de|mon&s;tration to the contrary; for the &s;ame malady broke out in every part of the kingdom, and had actually prevailed in Che&s;ter, in the north-we&s;t corner of England, the year preceding.</P>
<P>It is idle to a&s;cribe the plague to infection, communicated from per&s;on to per&s;on, or from clothes to per&s;ons. The di&s;ea&s;e, in 1602 was in every part of Europe, and appeared nearly at the &s;ame time, in the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts. In this ca&s;e, as in tho&s;e before related, of 1580 and 1591, it had been preceded by catarrh, and a cour&s;e of malignant fevers.

<P>In Augu&s;t 1603 in Paris died 2000 per&s;ons weekly of the plague. This di&s;ea&s;e was attributed to the diet and filth accu|mulated, under a defective police.</P>

And here for the fir&s;t time, I am able to introduce North-America, into this hi&s;tory; from which will be derived &s;ome of the mo&s;t important evidence in regard to the univer&s;ality of the cau&s;es of pe&s;tilential epidemics.</P>
<P>The &s;everity of the winter mentioned was equally great in America, as in Europe. George Popham, and a company of &s;ettlers under the patent of king James, to the London mer|chants, attempted a &s;ettlement at Sagadahoc in 1607; but Pop|ham, the Pre&s;ident, died during the winter, and the extreme cold was one of the di&s;couragements that contributed to break up the &s;ettlement.</P>

<P>In this &s;ame year was an eruption of Etna.</P>
<P>The comet of this year produced a mo&s;t remarkable tempe&s;t, with a &s;well of the ocean, that did incredible damage in Eng|land. In the latter part of winter, the tempe&s;t brought in a flood into the Severn, which overflowed the country, near Bri&s;tol, to the extent of ten miles, with a rapidity, that left no time for the people to &s;ave their effects, and many lives were lo&s;t. The flood ro&s;e above the hou&s;es, where people had re|&s;orted for &s;afety, and overwhelmed them. The lo&s;s of cattle and goods was immen&s;e.</P>
<P>In Somer&s;et&s;hire, the inundation laid wa&s;te an extent of 20 miles by 10; overwhelming five towns. So &s;udden was the

irruption, that laborers were caught in the fields, and were &s;een floating on the timbers of their hou&s;es. In Norfolk, the inun|dation was not le&s;s de&s;tructive.</P>
<BIBL>Thuanus, lib. 138.</BIBL>
<P>In 1608 a very malignant dy&s;entery prevailed.</P>
<P>In 1609 the approach of the &s;econd comet produced effects equally remarkable with the la&s;t. The action of &s;ubterranean fire was exten&s;ive. There was an eruption of Etna, and a vio|lent earthquake at Lima in Peru. The winter was &s;o &s;evere, as to convert the Thames into a common highway.</P>
<P>In this year the plague was augmented in London; and it raged in Alemar and Denmark. In the years 1607 and 8, it had been very mortal in Cork.</P>
<P>The pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air, at this time, was experienced at &s;ea. The people on board the fleet under Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers, bound to Virginia, were &s;eized with the calenture, a &s;potted pe&s;tilent fever, which, on board of one of the &s;hips, was &s;o malignant as to be called the plague. Thir|ty-two dead bodies were thrown out of two &s;hips. Was this di&s;ea&s;e imported? In the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age, the fleet met with a tre|mendous &s;torm of four days continuance, and Sir T. Gates was &s;hipwrecked on Bermuda.</P>
<BIBL>Purchas, vol. 4. p. 1733.</BIBL>
<P>In 1610 the catarrh was again epidemic. In &s;ome parts of the continent prevailed the Hungarian fever like the plague, and &s;evere bilious complaints. A remarkable fiery bow in the heav|ens was ob&s;erved in Hungary; and Con&s;tantinople was infe&s;ted with clouds of gra&s;s-hoppers, of great &s;ize, that devoured every green thing. The malignant &s;ore throat was fatal in Spain, and authors relate that this was its fir&s;t appearance in that coun|try.</P>
<P>In 1611 the plague carried off 200,000 of the inhabitants of Con&s;tantinople. It appeared al&s;o in &s;ome other places. The &s;ummers of the three la&s;t years were very hot and dry.</P>
<P>In 1612 appeared a comet. A terrible tempe&s;t made great havoc with &s;hipping&mdash;2000 dead bodies of &s;ailors were found on the coa&s;t of England, and 1200 on that of Holland. Some towns were injured. In the following year, Provence in France
<PB N="175" REF="036687_0179_100AA1E373A0CC00">
was greatly injured by an inundation; and &s;warms of locu&s;ts &s;ucceeded, which laid wa&s;te the vegetable kingdom.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer of 1612 in England was exce&s;&s;ively dry, and a malignant fever &s;everely afflicted the nation.</P>
<P>In 1613 the plague appeared in detached parts of France, and in Montpelier, a malignant di&s;ea&s;e &s;o fatal, as to want only the buboes, to prove it the true plague. It was marked with red and livid &s;pots, &s;wellings behind the ears and carbuncles. One third who were &s;eized died.</P>
<BIBL>Riverius, lib. 17.</BIBL>
<P>The preceding &s;ummers, the earth was covered with gra&s;s|hoppers, and the air filled with clouds of flies.</P>
<P>In this year al&s;o Con&s;tantinople was ravaged with the plague; and as cats were &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;pread the infection, the phy&s;icians, who were mo&s;tly Jews, advi&s;ed the emperor Achmet I. and he accordingly ordered all the cats to be tran&s;ported to a de&s;ert i&s;land near Scutari.</P>

<P>In 1614 the winter was &s;evere; there was an eruption of Etna, and an earthquake in the Azores. The heavens appeared, at one time in a flame, and afterwards very dark.</P>
<P>This year was remarkable for the mo&s;t univer&s;al &s;mall-pox, and mo&s;t fatal ever known. It laid wa&s;te Alexandria, Crete, Turkey, Calabria, Italy, Venice, Dalmatia, France, Germa|ny, Poland, Flanders and England. The mortality equalled that of the plague. In Per&s;ia al&s;o it raged, with mea&s;les.</P>
<P>In 1615 the &s;ea&s;ons were cold. In 1616 a very hot and dry &s;ummer&mdash;quartan agues epidemic&mdash;not a family in Germany e&s;caped; but not fatal.</P>
<P>In 1617 the &s;ummer was hot and dry.</P>
<P>In 1618 appeared a remarkable comet in November, (Short mentions four) and a town in Rhetia was overwhelmed by an earthquake. Violent tempe&s;ts, inundations and hurricanes are recorded of the &s;ame year, and in Bermuda, the year following, a &s;torm tore up the &s;tronge&s;t trees by the roots. In 1619 Heckla di&s;charged her fiery contents.</P>
<P>In 1618 broke out in Naples a malignant Angina which rav|aged the place for many years. The plague appeared at Bergen,
<PB N="176" REF="036687_0180_100AA1E554DDDBA0">
in Norway, in Denmark and in Grand Cairo. This was the beginning of a very pe&s;tilential period, and here mu&s;t be intro|duced the terrible pe&s;tilence which wa&s;ted the American Indians, ju&s;t before our ance&s;tors landed in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. As this is one of the mo&s;t remarkable facts in hi&s;tory, and one that demon|&s;trates the general cau&s;es of plague to belong to other climates, be&s;ides tho&s;e of Egypt and the Levant, I have taken great pains to a&s;certain the &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e, and the time of its appearance.</P>
<P>Capt. Dermer, an Engli&s;h adventurer, who had arrived in America, in a fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;el, a year or two before, pa&s;&s;ed the winter of 1618-19 in Monhiggan, an Indian town on the northern coa&s;t On the 19th of May 1619 he &s;ailed along the coa&s;t, on his way to Virginia, and landed at &s;everal places, where he had been the year before; and he found many Indian towns totally depopulated&mdash;in others a few natives remained alive, but "not free of &s;ickne&s;s;" "their di&s;ea&s;e, the plague, for we might perceive the &s;ores of &s;ome that had e&s;caped, who de&s;cribed the &s;pots of &s;uch as u&s;ually die." The&s;e are his words. He found &s;ome villages, which, in his former vi&s;it, were populous, all de&s;erted&mdash;the Indians "all dead."</P>
<BIBL>Purchas, vol. 4. 1778.</BIBL>
<P>Richard Vines, and his companions, who had been &s;ent by Ferdinando Gorges, to explore the country, wintered among the Indians, during the pe&s;tilence, and remained untouched, the di&s;ea&s;e attacking none of the Engli&s;h. Belknap's Life of Gor|ges, American Biography, vol. 1. p. 355, but the year is not &s;pecified.</P>
<P>Gookin, in his account of the Indians, Hi&s;torical Collections, p. 8, places this pe&s;tilence in 1612 and 13, about &s;even or eight years before the Engli&s;h arrived at Plymouth. But this cannot be accurate, unle&s;s the di&s;ea&s;e began to rage for a number of years previous to 1618. Capt. Dermer's letter in Purchas is deci&s;ive of the time of the principal &s;ickne&s;s, and fortunately we have another authority which is indi&s;putable.</P>
<P>A &s;ermon was preached by Elder Cu&s;hman at Plymouth, in 1620, ju&s;t after the colony arrived, and &s;ent to London to be publi&s;hed. In the Epi&s;tle Dedicatory which is dated December, 21, 1621, the author has the&s;e words. "They [the Indians]
<PB N="177" REF="036687_0181_100AA1E7B3A64270">
were very much wa&s;ted of late, by a great mortality, that fell among&s;t them, <HI>three years &s;ince,</HI> which, with their own civil di&s;&s;entions and bloody wars, hath &s;o wa&s;ted them, as I think the twentieth per&s;on is &s;carce left alive."</P>
<BIBL>Hazard's Collection, vol. 1. p. 148.</BIBL>
<P>This corre&s;ponds al&s;o with the accounts in Prince's Chronol|ogy from original manu&s;cripts. This fixes the time in 1618, preci&s;ely agreeable to Capt. Dermer's account. This was the year of the principal mortality; but like other pe&s;tilential pe|riods, this continued for a number of years; for &s;ome of the Plymouth &s;ettlers went to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, (now Bo&s;ton) in 1622, to purcha&s;e corn of the natives; and "found among the In|dians, a great &s;ickne&s;s, not unlike the plague, if not the &s;ame." It raged in winter, and affected the Indians only.</P>
<BIBL>See Purchas 4. 1858. Prince's Chron. 124.</BIBL>
<P>The time then is fixed. The di&s;ea&s;e commenced, or raged with its principal violence in 1618 and through the winter. This was the year of the remarkable comet, when the plague was raging in many parts of the world. So fatal was the pe&s;tilence in America, that the warriors from Narragan&s;ett to Penob&s;cot, the di&s;tance to which the di&s;ea&s;e &s;eems to have been limited, were reduced from 9000 to a few hundreds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hutchin&s;on &s;ays, 30,000 of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts tribe alone were &s;uppo&s;ed to be reduced to 300.</NOTE> When our an|ce&s;tors arrived in 1620, they found the bones of tho&s;e who per|i&s;hed, in many places, unburied.</P>
<BIBL>Magnalia, book 1. p. 7.</BIBL>
<P>The kind of di&s;ea&s;e is another important que&s;tion. Dermer &s;eems to think it a &s;pecies of plague, and he &s;aw &s;ome of the &s;ores of tho&s;e who had &s;urvived. Hutchin&s;on, vol. 1. p. 34, 35, &s;ays &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed it to have been the &s;mall-pox, but the Indians, who were perfectly acquainted with this di&s;ea&s;e, after the Engli&s;h arrived, always gave a very different account of it, and de&s;cribed it as a pe&s;tilential putrid fever.</P>
<P>Fortunately General Gookin, in the pa&s;&s;age above cited, has left us a fact, which leaves no doubt as to the nature of the mal|ady. His words are&mdash; "What the di&s;ea&s;e was, which &s;o gen|erally
<PB N="178" REF="036687_0182_100AA1EB8440AB38">
and mortally &s;wept them away, I cannot learn. Doubt|le&s;s it was &s;ome pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e. I have di&s;cour&s;ed with &s;ome old Indians, that were then youths, who &s;ay, that the <HI>bodies all over were exceeding yellow</HI> (de&s;cribing it by a yellow garment they &s;howed me) both before they died and afterwards."</P>
<P>This account may be relied on for its authenticity and it de|cides the que&s;tion, that the pe&s;tilence was the true American plague, called yellow fever. If any confirmation of this evi|dence were nece&s;&s;ary, we have it in Prince's Chronology, where it is recorded that this fever produced hemorrhagy from the no&s;e.</P>
<P>At the time Gookin wrote, about forty or fifty years after the &s;ettlement of New-England, the infectious fevers of autumn were called "pe&s;tilent," and they were frequent in the country, but had not then acquired the appellation of <HI>yellow.</HI></P>
<BIBL>Winthrop's Journal, p. 51.</BIBL>
<P>This fever has been frequent among the Indians &s;ince the Eng|li&s;h &s;ettled the country. Some in&s;tances will be hereafter related.</P>
<P>The evidence then of the origin of the yellow fever in this country, between the 41&s;t and 44th degrees of latitude, is com|plete, leaving no room for doubt or controver&s;y. No intercour&s;e exi&s;ted, in 1618, between this continent and the We&s;t-Indies; nor did a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el pa&s;s between New-England and the i&s;lands, till twenty years after that pe&s;tilence. Not one of the i&s;lands was then &s;ettled, except by the Spaniards, with whom our an|ce&s;tors had no commerce. Not an European was among the Indians, except a French &s;eaman, who had e&s;caped from a wreck a year or two before, and Mr. Vine's men, who arrived di|rectly from England. The&s;e men e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e; none be|ing attacked but the Indians; another evidence of the origin of the malady in the country.</P>
<P>In Gorges' de&s;cription of New-England, there is the follow|ing account of this pe&s;tilence. " The &s;ummer after the blazing &s;tar, which moved from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t, even a little before the Engli&s;h removed from Holland to Plymouth, in New-Eng|land, there befel a great mortality among the Indians, the great|e&s;t that had ever happened in the memory of man, or been ta|ken notice of by tradition, laying wa&s;te the ca&s;t."</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="036687_0183_100AA1ED0BAAADD8">The author further remarks that this &s;tar was much noted in Europe. In America it was &s;een in the &s;outh-we&s;t, for "thirty &s;leeps," as the Indians expre&s;s them&s;elves. The de&s;cription of the comet here given an&s;wers to that of Riverius, who repre|&s;ents it as very &s;plendid, larger than Venus, moving from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t, and vi&s;ible from Nov. 27, 1618, till the clo&s;e of December. This was the time the pe&s;tilence was raging among the Indians. Gorges indeed &s;ays, it was the &s;ummer <HI>after</HI> the blazing &s;tar. It is true, that the di&s;ea&s;e continued not only into 1619, but occurred in autumn for &s;ome years &s;ub&s;e|quent. We hear of it among the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Indians in 1622. From this it appears that this was a long and &s;evere period of pe&s;tilence, between 1617 and 1623, or a later year; like the pre&s;ent period in the United States.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remarked that in 1618, the &s;ame year when the In|dians in America were falling a prey to this malady, the angina ma|ligna broke out in the kingdom of Naples, and &s;pread mortality over the country, as authors affirm, for eighteen years. This how|ever is not under&s;tood, as affirming the di&s;ea&s;e to have been con|&s;tantly epidemic; but as prevailing at certain times and &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>The &s;ame de&s;tructive principle operated in Virginia. Capt. Dermer relates that when he arrived in the Che&s;apeek on the 8th of September, "The fir&s;t news &s;truck cold to our hearts, the &s;ickne&s;s over the land."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capt. Dermer was probably the fir&s;t Engli&s;hman that ever pa&s;&s;ed through the rapids between Long-I&s;land and the main land, now called Hell-Gate. He de&s;cribes this pa&s;&s;age as a cataract, and mentions the difference in times of high water, from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t and we&s;t.</NOTE> Three hundred of the &s;ettlers died in 1619.</P>
<P>It appears from Purchas that the emigrants to Virginia in 1619, 20 and 21, amounted to 3570, in 42 &s;ail of &s;hips.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Jeffer&s;on allows only 2516 per&s;ons to have arrived in that period.</NOTE> There were 600 &s;ouls in that colony before the&s;e arrived, mak|ing the whole number 4170. Of the&s;e, 349 peri&s;hed in the Indian ma&s;&s;acre of 1622, which would leave 3821 &s;urvivors. But in 1624 no more than 1800 were living. Scanty means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence might have contributed to this mortality; but mo&s;t of it was in con&s;equence of fevers, that were probably the ef|fects
<PB N="180" REF="036687_0184_100AA1EEC6D73498">
of the climate, and a very unfavorable &s;tate of the atmo&s;|phere.</P>
<P>In 1620 a comet was followed by a cold winter. In England the year was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a violent tempe&s;t, a preternatural tide, and a very wet &s;ummer. The Hungarian fever, &s;o called, &s;pread along the Rhine, and in the next year became infectious. London became &s;ickly. The year 1621 was remarkable for an epidemic malignant &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>In 1622 a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">omet is noted, and an earthquake in Italy. In New-England the &s;pring was exce&s;&s;ively dry, from the third week in May to the middle of July.</P>
<P>In 1623 the epidemic fevers in Europe became more fatal, as the period of pe&s;tilence approached. This is obvious from the London burials, which &s;how a con&s;iderable increment. Rive|rius, who has written on the epidemic fevers of this period in the &s;outh of France, ob&s;erves that the mortality was great, until he began to bleed and purge, when it abated. He refers to the city of Montpelier, where almo&s;t half died who were &s;eized. The di&s;ea&s;e was a &s;pecies of pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>This author concurs with the ancients in a&s;cribing pe&s;tilence to comets. Speaking of the &s;ingular &s;tar of 1618, he &s;ays, "Hunc vero Cometam, morborum malignorum et pe&s;tilentium, necnon etiam bellorum, quibus univer&s;a pen&egrave; hactenus Europa deva&s;tata e&s;t, prae&s;agium ac prenuntium fui&s;&s;e, credere non alie|num e&s;t."</P>
<BIBL>De febre pe&s;t. 533. fol.</BIBL>
<P>The author falls into the error, which has brought into con|tempt the opinions of the ancient &s;ages, in regard to the influ|ence of the &s;tars on man, and the &s;tate of the elements. He a&s;cribes <HI>moral</HI> as well as <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> effects to that influence. Ad|mitting the di&s;tant orbs to have &s;ome effect on the air or fire of our &s;y&s;tem, and through that medium to augment or dimini&s;h the &s;timulus which acts on the human body and of cour&s;e on the pa&s;&s;ions, by the exciting powers; yet any moral effects derived from this &s;ource, mu&s;t be &s;o incon&s;iderable, or &s;o blended with the effects of other cau&s;es, as intere&s;t, ambition, love, revenge and the like, that the degree of influence could not be a&s;cer|tained, nor the effects of one cau&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of the
<PB N="181" REF="036687_0185_100AA1F11A55A360">
other. I reject therefore all <HI>moral</HI> effects a&s;cribed to comets; but the <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> effects are, beyond que&s;tion, great and exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;es of this period continued to multiply and grow more malignant in 1624, when the epidemic a&s;&s;umed the form of the &s;potted fever. In 1625 this fever turned to the plague, and in 1626 changed back to the &s;potted fever, &s;ays Lotichius, cited by Short. This is not an unu&s;ual fact.</P>
<P>The plague in 1625 &s;wept away 35,000 of the citizens of London. It raged at the &s;ame time in Italy, Denmark and Leyden, and how much more exten&s;ively, I am not informed.</P>
<P>In this year another comet was &s;een; &s;everal cities in Spain were overwhelmed by inundations; the winter was &s;evere; the &s;ummer, hot and moi&s;t weather; and there was an eruption of a volcano in Iceland. It is remarkable al&s;o that, in this year, a volcano bur&s;t forth in Palma, one of the Canaries, with a vi|olent earthquake.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer of 1626 was very hot, and the plague continued its ravages in many parts of Europe, as in Wittemburg and the vicinity; and in Lyons, which lo&s;t 60,000 of its inhabitants. This was the prelude to more general calamity in France; for in the following years the whole country felt the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ef|fects of the malady.</P>
<P>In 1627 and 8 the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e prevailed in various other countries, e&s;pecially in Aug&s;burg after a famin. In 1629 the pe&s;tilence raged in Am&s;terdam. In 1630 Cambridge in Eng|land was vi&s;ited. It was a very &s;ickly &s;ummer in London, &s;o that the citizens were alarmed and many retired to the country; but finding the country very &s;ickly, they returned.</P>
<P>In 1629 Pola, a town in the Venetian territories, lo&s;t 7000 inhabitants by an earthquake.</P>
<P>Of the pe&s;tilence in this period, there was hardly a &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion. Particular countries enjoyed &s;hort intervals of health; but Europe and America were &s;everely annoyed by pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es between 1632 and 1637.</P>
<P>In 1630 happened great explo&s;ions of &s;ubterranean fire. A|pulia lo&s;t 17,000 people by an earthquake; and Lima, in South-America,
<PB N="182" REF="036687_0186_100AA1F4202D7128">
was laid in ruins by the like cata&s;trophe. At this time the plague prevailed in Vienna.</P>
<P>In 1631 happened a memorable earthquake in Naples, with a tremendous eruption of Ve&s;uvius, which continued or was re|peated in 1632. In this eruption, Baglivus a&s;&s;ures us, Ve&s;u|vius lo&s;t 240 feet of its altitude.</P>
<P>Cotemporary with the&s;e di&s;charges of fire and lava, was an ery&s;ipelous fever in Europe with inflammation in the jaws, and an increa&s;e of mortality, antecedent to a general plague. See the bills of mortality for London, Aug&s;burg and Dre&s;den, where the progre&s;s of the malignity in the epidemics, is di&s;tinct|ly marked, by an augmentation of the bills, till the plague in 1636.</P>
<P>In 1633 appeared a comet, which was followed by a &s;evere winter. The &s;ame winter in America was mild, &s;ays Winthrop, p. 61. Southerly winds prevailed till the clo&s;e of winter, when there were great &s;nows. It is very common that &s;evere cold is progre&s;&s;ive, happening in Europe one year before it does in A|merica, as will hereafter appear.</P>
<P>In 1633 the year of the comet, commenced an eruption of Etna, which continued for four or five years, through this whole pe&s;tilential period. London was &s;haken by an earthquake, and at Halifax in York&s;hire raged a very malignant fever.</P>
<P>In this year al&s;o a "pe&s;tilent fever," invaded the little colo|ny at Plymouth in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and carried off twenty of their number. This was a great mortality for that &s;mall &s;ettle|ment. It mu&s;t have been occa&s;ioned by a fever of dome&s;tic ori|gin, as the colony had, at that time, no intercour&s;e with for|eign countries, except with England. No &s;u&s;picion has ever been entertained that the di&s;ea&s;e was of foreign origin.</P>

principle in the elements. The &s;ame &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;es appeared, at the &s;ame time, in Aug&s;burg, Dre&s;den, London, and in America. Probably the &s;ame &s;pecies prevailed over mo&s;t of Europe; for we hear of them in every part of Holland in the following year. The di&s;ea&s;es predominant, previous to the plague, are of the eruptive kind: Such was the ca&s;e in the pre&s;|ent in&s;tance. In America, the epidemic among the Indians took the form of the &s;mall-pox; and altho it is the current opin|ion that the &s;mall-pox is communicated only by contagion, yet my inve&s;tigations have &s;atisfied me that this is a great error. The &s;mall-pox is one of the <HI>family of eruptive di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> which belong to almo&s;t every pe&s;tilential period. Before its origin and progre&s;s had been affected by the art of innoculation, it u&s;ed to be epidemic, in large cities, under that inflammatory condition of the atmo&s;phere, which originated mea&s;les, influenza, anginas and plague, and <HI>rarely or never at any other time.</HI> This di&s;ea&s;e therefore, tho communicable at any time by infection, is gene|rated in particular habits without any infecting cau&s;e ab extra; and is the offspring of that &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere which gen|erates other eruptive epidemics.</P>
<P>In 1634 the plague &s;howed it&s;elf at Rati&s;bon. The &s;ummer in America was hotter than u&s;ual, and the following winter was very cold.</P>
<P>In 1635 the plague appeared in Leyden and 20,000 inhabit|ants peri&s;hed. This year was di&s;tingui&s;hed for an eruption of Ve&s;uvius, violent earthquakes, an inundation in Hol&s;tein which de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">royed 600 people and 50,000 head of cattle, and a terrible tempe&s;t in America on the 15th of Augu&s;t O.

It will appear hereafter that mo&s;t of the violent &s;torms and hurricanes, which &s;weep the earth, happen during or near the time of the di&s;charges of great quantities of fire from volcanoes. In this year, Etna and Ve|&s;uvius were both in a &s;tate of eruption. The plague appeared al&s;o in Mentz and other parts of Germany.</P>
<P>In 1636 there was an eruption of Heckla. The pe&s;tilence was general in proportion to this univer&s;al agitation of the central

fires. In London it prevailed in 1636 after a regular increa&s;e of previous malignity in di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Of the progre&s;s of the pe&s;tilence in Holland, and e&s;pecially in Nimeguen, we have an accurate account in the treati&s;e of the able Diemerbroeck, which is by far the mo&s;t learned and philo|&s;ophic work on the plague, that I have &s;een. Not that I believe his opinion of the cau&s;e of the plague; but his view of the &s;ub|ject is otherwi&s;e correct and worthy of univer&s;al attention.</P>
<P>In 1635 when the plague appeared in Leyden, the malignant di&s;ea&s;es, its precur&s;ors, appeared in various parts of Holland. In Nimeguen, the&s;e precur&s;ors were mea&s;les, &s;mall-pox, dy&s;en|teries of the wor&s;t type, but e&s;pecially the &s;potted fever. The malignity of this fever increa&s;ed, until it <HI>changed into the real plague</HI>&mdash;"donec in aperti&s;&s;imam pe&s;tem tran&s;iret," &s;ays Diemer|broeck.</P>
<P>The plague appeared, in a few ca&s;es, in November 1635, but made little progre&s;s, during the winter. In January appearan|ces were more alarming; in March the malady &s;pread rapidly and continued to increa&s;e till autumn. Scarcely a hou&s;e e&s;caped; more than half who were &s;eized, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied; and medical aid was baffled. The di&s;ea&s;e declined in the following winter, and was extingui&s;hed by a &s;evere fro&s;t in February 1637.</P>
<P>The &s;ummers of 1636 and 7 were warm, the winds con&s;tantly from the &s;outh and we&s;t, "cum magnis aeris &s;qualoribus," &s;ays Diemerbroeck.</P>
<P>In 1635 a dy&s;entery prevailed in mo&s;t parts of Germany. In 1636 the eruption from Etna was augmented, and Rome was &s;everely afflicted with the plague. In 1637 the &s;ame di&s;temper raged in &s;ome parts of Holland, in Denmark, Con&s;tantinople and Natolia; after which year the di&s;ea&s;e declined or di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>This period of di&s;ea&s;e was al&s;o experienced in Virginia, where, &s;ays Winthrop, died 1800 people in the year 1635.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer of 1638 was very hot and dry in England, as it was in America, after a very &s;evere winter, and cold &s;pring.</P>

The year was al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed for tempe&s;tuous weath|er; not for ordinary &s;torms which occur many times every year, but violent hurricanes of va&s;t extent.

<P>The introduction of the plague into Naples was a&s;cribed to a tran&s;port of &s;oldiers from Sardinia. How the di&s;ea&s;e came to be in Sardinia, we are not informed. But this report, like nine tenths of all the &s;tories about infection, is demon&s;trably a mi&s;|take. The account given in the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e, is, that it was at fir&s;t called by phy&s;icians a "malignant fever." One of the faculty, a man probably of more ob&s;ervation and firm|ne&s;s than the others, affirmed the di&s;temper to be pe&s;tilential, and for his audacity, was impri&s;oned by the Viceroy, who ap|prehended the report might injure the bu&s;ine&s;s and reputation of the city.</P>
<P>We have then another in&s;tance of the uncertainty in the minds of medical gentlemen, about the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, when it fir&s;t appeared, becau&s;e it was not characterized by the di&s;tinctive marks of the plague, the glandular tumors.

If the plague has this &s;pecies of contagion, it cannot communicate another di&s;ea&s;e, a malignant fever, for in&s;tance, which has a different character or type, and

Hence the uncertainty that per|plexes the phy&s;ician and the magi&s;trate at the commencement of the plague&mdash;an uncertainty that has originated in the errors re|&s;pecting the &s;pecific nature of the di&s;ea&s;e and its propagation by infection&mdash;errors as fatal to great cities, as to truth and philo&s;o|phy.</P>
<P>Had the real origin of this di&s;ea&s;e been known, the certainty of the exi&s;tence of it in Naples, Venice, Rome, Vienna, Am|&s;terdam and London, would have induced the citizens to aban|don the places, before the di&s;temper had made much progre&s;s, and multitudes of lives would have been &s;aved&mdash;an expedient practi&s;ed in America, with the mo&s;t &s;alutary effects.</P>
<P>In Genoa, the di&s;ea&s;e manife&s;ted a more di&s;tinct progre&s;&s;ion; 10,000 died the fir&s;t year, and about 70,000 the &s;econd.</P>
<P>When this di&s;temper appeared in Malta, Candia and Sardinia, every po&s;&s;ible precaution was taken to prevent its introduction in|to Genoa, by &s;topping intercour&s;e with tho&s;e places; but in vain.</P>
<P>When the report of a malignant infectious fever in Naples prevailed in May 1656, an alarm was excited in Rome; a com|mittee of health watched over the &s;afety of that city; four of the gates were &s;hut and barred; the others were guarded with vigilance to prevent any per&s;on from entering who could be &s;u&s;|pected of infection; but all efforts were u&s;ele&s;s. The real truth was the di&s;ea&s;e was an epidemic, no more under the control of health laws, than the influenza and &s;ore throat which had pre|ceded it.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer of 1657 in England was very hot, and &s;ucceed|ed by a long &s;evere winter and deep &s;now.</P>
<P>In April 1658 commenced in Europe an epidemic catarrh, which was &s;o &s;udden in its attack as to &s;eize a whole village in a
<PB N="193" REF="036687_0197_100AA20DAD87D688">
night. It was &s;evere and fatal to old people&mdash;its cour&s;e was fin|i&s;hed in about &s;ix weeks. The &s;ummer was hot and fevers with vertigo and delirium, were epidemic.</P>
<BIBL>See Short, vol. 1. and Morton's Treati&s;e.</BIBL>
<P>It will be remarked that the year 1647 when the influenza invaded America, was a &s;ickly year in Europe. In 1655 when the plague was epidemic in Europe, the influenza again prevailed in America. In 1658 when the influenza invaded Europe, great &s;ickne&s;s and mortality occurred in America. The&s;e alter|nations of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es will be ob&s;erved in the &s;ub&s;equent &s;tages of this hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>In 1659 prevailed the Cynanche Trachealis in America&mdash;the fir&s;t in&s;tance mentioned in our annals. Magnalia, b. 4. 156.&mdash; This di&s;ea&s;e was al&s;o &s;ucceeded by malignant di&s;ea&s;es, for the Legi&s;lature of Connecticut in October 1662 appointed a day of thank&s;giving, two rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for which were, the "abate|ment of the &s;ickne&s;s in the country, and a &s;upply of rain in time of drouth."</P>
<P>This was the commencement of a very &s;ickly period in Europe. In 1660 occurred an eruption of Ve&s;uvius, and of a volcano in Iceland. The year was very tempe&s;tuous, and earthquakes &s;hook England, France and America. In 1661 appeared a comet.</P>
<P>In 1662 another con&s;iderable earthquake happened in New-England; and in this year was the drouth above mentioned.&mdash; In 1663 Canada was convul&s;ed for five months by a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;hocks&mdash;&s;mall rivers and &s;prings were dried up&mdash;the waters of others were tinctured with the ta&s;te of &s;ulphur&mdash;an immen&s;e ridge of mountains &s;ub&s;ided to a plain. Such were the phenomena in America which marked this pe&s;tilential period.</P>

<P>In 1663 a malignant di&s;ea&s;e &s;eized the inhabitants of the Ve|netian territories and 60,000 peri&s;hed. The country, at the &s;ame time, was overrun by innumerable &s;mall worms.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, a memorable mortality occurred in England, among the cattle and &s;heep, by means of a di&s;ea&s;e in which the
<PB N="194" REF="036687_0198_100AA210CE4B39B8">
liver was eaten by &s;mall worms, and in &s;ome ca&s;es, the lungs. The&s;e phenomena were the precur&s;ors of the plague in many parts of Europe. In England, all di&s;ea&s;es a&s;&s;umed new violence, as early as in 1661, preparatory to the great plague. See Sy|denham. In Holland, the plague appeared at Heu&s;den, in 1663.</P>
<P>The winter of 1663-4 was mild. In the following &s;ummer, Pru&s;&s;ia was afflicted by a malignant purple fever, attended with tumors or inflammation in the throat, very fatal to the young. Bonnetus. Med. Septen. p. 206. A &s;pecies of &s;carlatina.</P>
<P>In 1664 appeared a comet; another in 1665, and a third in 1666. In 1664 began an eruption of Etna, which la&s;ted, with various degrees of violence, till the year 1669, when it ended with a mo&s;t dreadful explo&s;ion. This period corre&s;ponds with the epidemics de&s;cribed by Sydenham.</P>
<P>In 1664 the &s;ummer in England was wet, and cattle died of di&s;ea&s;es. In New-England commenced the mildew of wheat, which has rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to cultivate that grain, on the Atlantic coa&s;t of the three Ea&s;tern States. The winter of 1664-5, was terribly &s;evere in England; the Thames was a bridge of ice, and in January happened earthquakes, in Coven|try and Buckingham&s;hire. During this winter inflammatory fevers and quin&s;ies, &s;ays Sydenham, were more frequent in Lon|don, than were before known. The&s;e gave way in May to a malignant fever, which could hardly be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the plague, which, in June, became the controling epidemic.</P>
<P>Such were the phenomena of the pe&s;tilential period under con|&s;ideration; and at this time, the plague appeared in Holland, and in England. Engli&s;h authors all agree that the di&s;ea&s;e was imported into England from Holland in &s;ome bales of cotton! O fatal bales of cotton! &s;ays Short. This tale has been record|ed and repeated by every writer on the &s;ubject, without a &s;ingle document in evidence to prove that any cotton was imported, or that the fir&s;t per&s;ons &s;eized had ever &s;een &s;uch cotton. The whole tale re&s;ts on a&s;&s;ertion. That the &s;eeds of the di&s;temper were <HI>not</HI> imported is evident from the acknowledged facts relative to its origin; and is demon&s;trated by the hi&s;tory of the prece|ding di&s;ea&s;es found in the works of Sydenham.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="036687_0199_100AA2130C5CD350">The origin of the pe&s;tilence, which arrived to its cri&s;is in 1665, is to be traced back to the year 1661, when malignant di&s;|ea&s;es began to appear in different and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;tant parts of the world. In London, the intermitting tertian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, &s;ays Sydenham, be|came epidemic, and differed from the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e in other years, by new and unu&s;ual &s;ymptoms, which in &s;hort, amounted to this, that they were "<HI>all more violent.</HI>" In winter, the di&s;ea&s;e yield|ed, as u&s;ual, to cold, but continued fevers prevailed every win|ter. The&s;e fevers, with &s;ome variations, continued until the &s;pring of 1665, and the bills &s;how how much they augmented the mortality in London.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the clear evidence of the&s;e facts, authors have conjured up a tale of importation which would di&s;grace a &s;chool|boy by its incon&s;i&s;tency.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If this language &s;hould be thought too &s;evere, I can &s;incerely &s;ay, that in my opinion, no language can be too &s;evere for the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s which has originated a &s;y&s;tem of error on this important &s;ubject.</NOTE> The account &s;tates, "That a violent plague had raged in Holland in 1663, on which account, the importation of merchandize from that country was prohibited by the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature in 1664.

<BIBL>Encyclopedia, art. London. 21.</BIBL>
<P>In the &s;ub&s;tance of the foregoing &s;tatement, all authors are agreed, and I want no other proof that the report of the impor|tation of the di&s;ea&s;e is all a vulgar, childi&s;h tale, the propagation
<PB N="196" REF="036687_0200_100AA2736F214AD8">
of which is a di&s;grace to philo&s;ophy and to the faculty of that age.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place we have no authentic evidence in any author, that any bales of cotton were brought from Holland to London, at that time. The whole a&s;&s;ertion re&s;ts on vulgar report, and is wholly un&s;upported by proof&mdash;had the report been well founded, the fact might have been a&s;certained, and in an affair of &s;uch magnitude, probably would have been. The importation of goods from Holland was prohibited by act of parliament.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appeared in We&s;tmin&s;ter, not in the commercial city of London, but in a place where bales of cotton would be the lea&s;t likely to be depo&s;ited and opened; We&s;tmin&s;ter being the re&s;idence of the nobility and gen|try, rather than a place of commerce.</P>
<P>In the third place, no proof is &s;tated that the per&s;ons fir&s;t &s;eized had any connection with bales of cotton.</P>
<P>In the fourth place, the death of two or three per&s;ons, with the plague-marks on their bodies, in December 1664, is no evidence of any imported infection at that time; for the bills of mortality &s;how, and the reader is de&s;ired to turn to them, to be &s;atisfied, that a &s;maller number died that year of the plague, than had died of it in any of the &s;ix preceding years. In the year 1659 died of that di&s;ea&s;e 36&mdash;in 1661 died 20, and every year more or le&s;s. In 1664 died but 6 of the plague, and yet this number, &s;mall as it was, mu&s;t be proof of the importation of infection, <HI>that year,</HI> when <HI>greater numbers,</HI> in preceding years, are pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence! In &s;uch accounts, there mu&s;t be want of knowledge, or want of hone&s;ty. The plague imported from Holland! when the city of London had not been free from it, for 28 years preceding! See the bills of mortality!&mdash;</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, why in the name of common &s;en&s;e, &s;hould "two or three," infected per&s;ons in 1664, &s;pread the plague over Lon|don, and de&s;olate the city, when twelve, fourteen, twenty and thirty-&s;ix infected per&s;ons, who died in preceding years, produced no ill effects? To account for &s;uch effects on the principle of <HI>in|fection,</HI> is not po&s;&s;ible; and men of &s;cience ought to be a&s;hamed of &s;uch ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="036687_0201_100AA275CE167200">In the fifth place, the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the di&s;ea&s;e, during &s;ix weeks, is evidence, that infection had no agency in &s;preading the di&s;ea&s;e. It is a fact known and acknowledged, that <HI>infection</HI> cannot be pre&s;erved, for a tenth part of that time in the open air. Air di&s;&s;olves the poi&s;on of any di&s;ea&s;e, in a very &s;hort time. Infection can only be pre&s;erved in confinement, as in clo&s;e ve&s;|&s;els or packages of goods. The walls of an infected hou&s;e will be clean&s;ed by the action of air, in a very few days, &s;o as to be perfectly harmle&s;s. During the &s;ix weeks &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the plague in London, where was the infection concealed to pre&s;erve it from air and fro&s;t?</P>
<P>Was the fomes &s;hut up by de&s;ign for a few weeks and then &s;et at liberty? Had the per&s;ons who were fir&s;t &s;eized in Febru|ary, any acce&s;s to the infected hou&s;es or clothes of tho&s;e who died in December? Is this probable? There is no &s;ugge&s;tion of this &s;ort.</P>
<P>Then again another interval of &s;everal weeks elap&s;ed from the death of tho&s;e in February, before others were feized. It is not &s;olely improbable; but I aver, that the fomes or infecting principle of no di&s;ea&s;e whatever, can be &s;u&s;pended in a &s;tate of inaction, in the open air, and afterwards give ri&s;e to di&s;ea&s;e. Unle&s;s therefore it can be proved that the per&s;ons who died in April had acce&s;s to infection, which had been clo&s;ely confined from the air, they could never have received the di&s;ea&s;e from the virus generated in February or December. Now it appears from the &s;tatement, that the per&s;ons, &s;eized in February, lived in a different part of the city, from tho&s;e who died in December, and no &s;ugge&s;tion that they had an intercour&s;e with any infected object.</P>
<P>But the la&s;t &s;entence of the &s;tatement di&s;proves fully all a&s;&s;er|tions and &s;u&s;picions re&s;pecting infection. It &s;eems that when the di&s;ea&s;e &s;howed it&s;elf in &s;pring, it &s;eized one here, and another there, in &s;cattered &s;ituations, "without any certain proof of their having infected each other." This is u&s;ually the ca&s;e in the plague, and in the yellow fever, in the ulcerous &s;ore throat, the dy&s;entery and other contagious, epidemic di&s;ea&s;es. The whole my&s;tery is, that any di&s;ea&s;e will <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;eize the con&s;titutions lea&s;t
<PB N="198" REF="036687_0202_100AA278E9888D98">
capable of re&s;i&s;ting that &s;tate of air, from which the di&s;ea&s;e pro|ceeds. One per&s;on will &s;u&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n a vitiated air, for one day only; another for two days, and a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rd for a week, before his con&s;ti|tution yields to the de&s;tructive principle. It is preci&s;ely with the acce&s;s of the plague, in a city, as with a company of men going from a healthy &s;ituation, into a mar&s;hy place&mdash;one man will be &s;eized very &s;peedily with the ague and fever; another will &s;u&s;tain his health for a week or two, and &s;ome perhaps e&s;|cape unaffected. This example explains the phenomena which attend the inva&s;ion of pe&s;tilence, as related by Evagrius, Die|merbroeck and others, and which will be more fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a &s;ub&s;equent &s;ection.</P>
<P>The account therefore of the origin of the plague in London in 1665, not only does not prove the di&s;ea&s;e to have proceeded from imported fomes, but actually demon&s;trates the impo&s;&s;ibility of the fact.</P>
<P>But we have better evidence than the popular accounts afford us, that the di&s;ea&s;e was generated in the city of London. Sy|denham has left facts on record, which place this point beyond controver&s;y.</P>
<P>After de&s;cribing the multiplied di&s;ea&s;es of increa&s;ed malignity, which prevailed in London, from 1661 to 1665, and which &s;welled greatly the bills of mortality in that city, he informs us that in May 1665 he was called to a&s;&s;i&s;t a woman of a &s;anguine habit, who was &s;eized with violent fever and frequent vomitings. He was &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ingularity of the &s;ymptoms, and puz|zled to know how to treat the di&s;ea&s;e. The woman died the 14th day. He ob&s;erved her face, during the fever, to be red, and that a little before her death, a few drops of blood i&s;&s;ued from her no&s;e. The&s;e and other circum&s;tances &s;ugge&s;ted to him the u&s;e of bleeding, and his next patient recovered.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies of malignant fever &s;oon &s;pread and towards the clo&s;e of May and beginning of June, became epidemic. Soon after appeared the true plague with its characteri&s;tic &s;ymptoms. After &s;tating the&s;e facts, Sydenham &s;ays, "Whether the fever under con&s;ideration de&s;erves to be entitled a plague, I dare not po&s;itively affirm; but this I know by experience, that all who
<PB N="199" REF="036687_0203_100AA27A7599A248">
were then &s;eized with the true plague, attended with all its pe|culiar concomitants, and for &s;ome time afterwards, in my neigh|borhood, had the &s;ame train of &s;ymptoms, both in the beginning and through the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e."</P>
<P>He then ob&s;erves that he attended &s;ome per&s;ons with the true plague, and afterwards, he &s;aw &s;everal ca&s;es of a &s;imilar fever.</P>
<BIBL>See chap. 2. &s;ect. 2.</BIBL>
<P>Had not the faculty been blinded to truth by their theory of <HI>&s;pecific contagion,</HI> it would not have been po&s;&s;ible &s;o long to over|look the <HI>progre&s;&s;ivene&s;s</HI> of the plague, which not only Sydenham, but many phy&s;icians of the 16th and 17th centuries ob&s;erved and recorded.</P>
<P>The malignant di&s;ea&s;es which prevailed from 1661 to 1664 marked a <HI>pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air</HI> in London. We now know what Sydenham could not know, that this unhealthy &s;tate of air extended not only over Europe, but over Per&s;ia and America. But the malignant fever which appeared in May, as de&s;cribed by Sydenham, was the <HI>fir&s;t &s;tage of the plague,</HI> or mild form of the di&s;ea&s;e, which <HI>always</HI> precedes that &s;tate of it which is char|acterized by buboes. This form of the di&s;ea&s;e appears before the &s;ea&s;on or &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere is advanced &s;ufficiently to give the de&s;tructive principle its full force.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;pecies of fever preceded the terrible plague in Ve|nice and in Naples, as before related; and this is always the cau&s;e of uncertainty and controver&s;y re&s;pecting the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, at its commencement. And it is remarkable that this milder form of the plague, often rages for many months, before the di&s;ea&s;e arrives to its cri&s;is. Thus in London, the pe&s;tilen|tial principle produced a few ca&s;es of real plague, in the winter of 1664-5. The ca&s;es mu&s;t have occurred in con&s;titutions more irritable, or &s;u&s;ceptible of the cau&s;e, than bodies in gene|ral; or the per&s;ons mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed to the action of pow|erful local cau&s;es, or to extreme debility. The &s;evere fro&s;t doubtle&s;s &s;u&s;pended the operation of the pe&s;tilential principle&mdash; but on the opening of &s;pring, the operation began, and pro|ceeded from the malignant epidemic of May to produce the mo&s;t deadly effects.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="036687_0204_100AA27D4CA555D0">I have one ob&s;ervation further to make on this &s;ubejct. It has been alledged and generally admitted that the plague was intro|duced into Am&s;terdam, in 1663 by a ve&s;&s;el from the Mediter|ranean. It is probable that if this que&s;tion could be fully can|va&s;&s;ed, the popular belief would appear to have had no better foundation, than many opinions in America, in regard to the importation of the yellow fever, which are proved to re&s;t merely on conjectures, &s;uppo&s;itions, and vague reports. But in regard to the origin of the pe&s;tilence in Holland, in this in&s;tance, it is wholly immaterial, whether popular opinion was well founded or not; for we have the expre&s;s authority of Diemerbroeck, that anterior to the arrival of the &s;hip, with the &s;uppo&s;ed infec|tion, the plague broke out in Heu&s;den, a town on a branch of the Meu&s;e, &s;urrounded by a mora&s;s, not a maritime place. Be|&s;ides the &s;potted fever, which precedes the plague and turns into it, had been prevailing in all parts of Holland in the preceding year. The pe&s;tilence therefore originated in Holland, <HI>before the infection arrived;</HI> and the tales of importation vani&s;h in &s;moke.</P>
<P>According to the bills of mortality, London lo&s;t upwards of 68,000 inhabitants by the plague in 1665, and more than 28,000 by other di&s;ea&s;es. As the 28,000 deaths by common di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t have occurred mo&s;tly in the &s;ix fir&s;t months of the year, before the plague raged, this circum&s;tance &s;hows what a great increa&s;e of mortality preceded the plague. With &s;uch evidence before their eyes, how can di&s;cerning men look abroad for the &s;ources of the malady!</P>
<P>It &s;hould al&s;o be remarked that this calamity among the hu|man race was preceded by a great mortality among cattle in 1664.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not pa&s;s unob&s;erved that the &s;ummer of 1665 in Eng|land was very temperate, the weather fine and the fruits good. All the writers of that day agree, that no cau&s;e of pe&s;tilence could be ob&s;erved in the vi&s;ible qualities of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t plague that has appeared in London, or in Great Britain. The di&s;appearance of the plague in that and other countries, is a mo&s;t con&s;oling fact, and one that has not a little engaged the minds of philo&s;ophic men, to di&s;cover the
<PB N="201" REF="036687_0205_100AA28006B23FA8">
cau&s;e. The cau&s;es u&s;ually a&s;&s;igned are, the de&s;truction of the city by fire in 1666, the more airy, convenient con&s;truction of the modern city, the introduction of fre&s;h water, with more cleanline&s;s, and improved habits of living.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons would have more weight in my mind, if the other large cities in England, in France, Spain, Holland and Germany, which have neither been burnt nor improved in their general &s;tructure, had not al&s;o e&s;caped the ravages of pe&s;tilence. But as the plague has not vi&s;ited Paris and Am&s;terdam, which retain their ancient con&s;truction, no more than London, which has been improved, we mu&s;t re&s;ort to other circum&s;tances for the cau&s;es of this exemption. The con&s;ideration of this &s;ubject will fall under another part of this work.</P>
<P>In 1666, appeared a comet, the &s;ummer was very hot, and a tremendous hurricane, tore up a thou&s;and trees in Nottingham fore&s;t, and of 50 hou&s;es in one village, &s;even only were left &s;tanding. In this tempe&s;t fell hail-&s;tones, as large as hens eggs. An earthquake occurred in Oxford&s;hire. Per&s;ia did not e&s;cape the effects of this pe&s;tilential con&s;titution.

<P>In 1666 dy&s;entery prevailed over England and many parts of Europe and in St. Domingo. This di&s;ea&s;e &s;eems to be the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or of the plague, and other epidemics. During the inflam|matory &s;tage of an epidemic con&s;titution, evidenced by mea&s;les, influenza, a mild &s;mall-pox, we rarely hear of de&s;tructive dy&s;en|tery. But after tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es have run their cour&s;e, dy&s;entery appears in many parts of a country, and &s;ometimes becomes al|mo&s;t univer&s;al. It would be a curious que&s;tion, by what means the inflammatory diathe&s;is, &s;o to &s;peak, of the epidemic period, acts upon the nerves, mu&s;cles and inte&s;tines, to give to the &s;ub|&s;equent autumnal fevers this particular direction.</P>
<P>During the foregoing &s;eries of epidemics in Europe, America did not e&s;cape. Slight &s;hocks of earthquake were felt in 1660,

<P>In 1668, appeared a comet with a &s;tupendous coma. This was attended by an exce&s;&s;ively hot &s;ummer, and malignant di&s;|ea&s;es in America.

<P>This year was marked al&s;o by violent earthquakes in Europe and A&s;ia. The winter of 1668-9 was very &s;evere, and ice was &s;een in the Bo&s;phorus; that of 1670 covered the Danube with a bridge of ice.</P>
<P>In winter appeared in Hungary two mock-&s;uns of re&s;plendent brightne&s;s&mdash;the infallible forerunner of great di&s;charges of elec|trical fire, or of violent tempe&s;ts.&mdash;On the 11th of March 1669, the eruption of Etna which had commenced in 1664 redoubled its fury, and by immen&s;e di&s;charges of lava laid wa&s;te the coun|try below.

<P>The &s;ummer of 1678 was very hot and dry. There was a comet and an earthquake in Lima. Fevers and affections of the throat were epidemic in the north of Europe.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the barrenne&s;s of my materials, this pe&s;tilen|tial period may be very clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed, by the mea&s;les from 1669 to 1672 with the &s;mall-pox, the catarrh of 1675, the &s;ub&s;equent malignant fevers and affections of the throat, and finally the pe&s;tilence of 1678.</P>
<P>The &s;ame deleterious principle extended to America. Our annals relate that the &s;ea&s;ons were unfavorable and the fruits bla&s;ted, while malignant di&s;ea&s;es prevailed among the people. The &s;ickne&s;s and bad &s;ea&s;ons were attributed, by our pious an|ce&s;tors, to the irreligion of the times, and to their di&s;u&s;e of fa&s;t|ing. On this occa&s;ion, a &s;ynod was convened to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es of God's judgments, and to propo&s;e a plan of reforma|tion.

<P>The comet of 1678 was followed by a very cold winter, after a rainy autumn, with an epidemic cough. A comet is mention|ed in 1679, and the plague was in Vienna.</P>
<P>The year 1680 was di&s;tingui&s;hed al&s;o for a &s;evere winter, and the noted comet that had appeared in Ju&s;tinian's reign. In Dre&s;den raged the plague. The &s;ummer was hot and &s;ickly.

A large meteor was &s;een in Germany, de&s;cending to the north and leaving behind it a long luminous &s;tream.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer of 1681 was exce&s;&s;ively dry. This was the forerunner of violent earthquakes, which, in 1682 &s;hook all Germany, Italy and Switzerland. In &s;ome places, the &s;hocks were preceeded, for four nights, by lights or flame, like ignes fatui, on the mountains. The convul&s;ions were attended with a di&s;agreeable &s;ulphurous &s;mell. In this year al&s;o was vi&s;ible a comet, and an eruption took place, both of Etna and Ve&s;uvius.</P>
<P>In this year 1682 a mortal di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread among the cattle in Italy, Switzerland and Germany, that was called the angina ma|ligna, and of which cattle died in 24 hours. Authors relate that a blue mi&s;t appeared on the herbage of pa&s;tures. The di&s;|ea&s;e moved about two German miles in 24 hours, and &s;pread over Germany and Poland. Cattle at rack and manger were affected equally with tho&s;e that grazed.</P>
<P>At Halle in Saxony prevailed the plague; and at Dublin, a petechial in which the brain was &s;everely affected, and bleeding pernicious.</P>
<P>The di&s;charges of fire already mentioned were productive, as u&s;ual, of violent winds. In Sicily, a tempe&s;t, preceded by great darkne&s;s, almo&s;t laid wa&s;te the i&s;land.</P>

<P>After the &s;evere fro&s;t in 1684, a malignant dy&s;entery raged over Europe. This and the two &s;ucceeding &s;ummers were hot and dry. In 1685 Languedoc in France was overrun by gra&s;s|hoppers, and the petechial fever was prevalent.</P>
<P>In September 1686 was &s;een a comet. At Lille in France, fell a &s;torm of hail, the &s;tones of which were of a pound weight. There was an eruption of Etna, in this year al&s;o, and a meteor was &s;een at Leip&s;ick on the 9th of July, which was &s;tationary for 7 minutes, at the height of 30 miles. It is curious to re|mark the coincidence in time between the phenomena of the electrical fluid, tempe&s;ts, &s;now and hail.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer of 1687 in Europe was very rainy. In Octo|ber the city of Lima in Peru, was demoli&s;hed by an earthquake.</P>
<P>The winter of 1688 was cold, and in the &s;ummer following epidemic catarrh &s;pread over Europe. This was preceded by a di&s;ea&s;e of the &s;ame &s;pecies among hor&s;es, attended with a de|fluxion of rheum from their no&s;es. Swarms of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;ects in &s;ome countries announced a pe&s;tilential period. In the interior of Germany were &s;ome dy&s;enteries. An earthquake was experi|enced at Naples, and Smyrna was laid in ruins.</P>
<P>In 1689 appeared a comet, and both Etna and Ve&s;uvius di&s;|charged fire. The autumn was very rainy, and the &s;potted fe|ver prevailed in &s;ome parts of Germany. In Bo&s;ton the &s;mall-pox was epidemic.</P>
<P>In 1690 the &s;ummer was rainy, frogs were in unu&s;ual numbers in Italy, and corn was cut &s;hort by mildew. Rainy &s;ea&s;ons gen|erally &s;ucceed great eruptions of volcanoes and earthquakes.</P>
<P>The year 1691 commenced with &s;evere fro&s;t, followed by a hot dry &s;ummer. The &s;potted fever prevailed in Italy, in which bleeding was fatal. There was al&s;o great mortality among cat|tle and &s;heep.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;ons in this year were peculiarly unfavorable in Amer|ica, altho I am not able to de&s;cribe them. It appears from the journals of the a&s;&s;embly of New-York, that upon an addre&s;s of

This is a remarkable fact, and not unfrequent, that at one and the &s;ame time, the powers of veget|ation fail in the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the earth. Perhaps we &s;hall be able to account for this in&s;tance of a deranged &s;tate of the elements by the univer&s;al explo&s;ions of fire in the two fol|lowing years.

<P>On the 7th of June 1692 after a &s;eries of dry, hot, calm weather, a mo&s;t dreadful earthquake &s;uddenly &s;unk the town of Port-Royal in Jamaica, and demoli&s;hed mo&s;t of the buildings on the i&s;land, with the lo&s;s of 2000 lives. After the earthquake, the heat was &s;till more inten&s;e, mu&s;quetoes were innumerable, and a malignant fever fell upon the inhabitants in all parts of the i&s;land, with which 3000 peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e invaded Barbadoes, and afflicted the i&s;land for many years. Indeed the whole world was &s;ickly.</P>
<P>On the 8th of September England, Holland, France and Germany were convul&s;ed by an earthquake, and Switzerland felt a &s;hock in October. In the &s;ame year was an eruption of Etna, and great &s;nows followed.</P>
<P>The &s;potted fever continued its ravages; and it was remarked to be much more malignant and fatal in the wane of the moon. During an eclip&s;e in 1693 the &s;ick almo&s;t all died. The di&s;ea&s;e was more fatal in town than country.</P>

<P>It is not within my limits to enumerate the mi&s;eries occa&s;ioned by this concu&s;&s;ion of the earth. Suffice it &s;ay that many towns were laid in ruins and 60,000 people peri&s;hed. During the con|vul&s;ion a fountain di&s;charged its waters as red as blood. This calamity was preceded by a &s;erene &s;ky, and followed by dark|ne&s;s or vapor of a reddi&s;h or yellow hue.</P>
<P>The effects of this earthquake were remarkable on the human body. Among the&s;e were malignant fevers, &s;mall-pox fatal among children; madne&s;s, dullne&s;s, &s;otti&s;hne&s;s and melancholy, with deliria and lethargy. Are not the&s;e effects produced by an exce&s;s of &s;timulus, occa&s;ioned by the &s;uperabundance of electricity?</P>
<P>The &s;ummer following this convul&s;ion of the earth, was in|temperately wet and cool, and corn was mildewed. Another account &s;ays the &s;ummer in Italy was very hot and dry.

<P>Mo&s;t dreadful &s;torms marked the &s;ame year; one in America, on the 19th of October, was memorable for its violence.</P>
<P>An epidemic catarrh began in Europe in October, being pre|ceded by a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e among hor&s;es.</P>

<P>In 1693 the &s;eamen and &s;oldiers, under Sir Francis Wheeler, who was &s;ent to conquer Martinico, were &s;eized with the plague of America, and three fourths of them peri&s;hed. Hutchin&s;on, vol. 2. 72, relates that this fleet came to Bo&s;ton and introduced the di&s;ea&s;e into that town, where it occa&s;ioned a deplorable mor|tality. Douglas relates the &s;ame fact.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="036687_0212_100AA29160408FB0">This account &s;eems to be contradicted by Mather, in his Mag|nalia, b. 1. 22. In a &s;ermon delivered on lecture day, April 7, 1698, it is a&s;&s;erted in &s;o many words, that "An Engli&s;h &s;quadron hath <HI>not</HI> brought among us the tremendous pe&s;tilence, under which a <HI>neighboring plantation</HI> hath undergone prodigious de&s;olations. Bo&s;ton, 'tis a marvellous thing a plague has <HI>not</HI> laid thee de&s;olate."</P>
<P>By comparing the date of this &s;ermon, with other events re|lated in it, I find there is no mi&s;take in the date; and as the author lived in Bo&s;ton, and was cotemporary with the&s;e events, and per&s;onally acquainted with Sir Francis Wheeler, I conclude it was not Bo&s;ton, but &s;ome other &s;ea port town, which &s;uffered by the arrival of a fleet.</P>
<P>In the 2d book of Magnalia, p. 71, the &s;ame author men|tions this expedition and the terrible mortality. He &s;ays the di&s;temper was "the mo&s;t like the plague, of any thing that had ever been &s;een in America, whereof there died <HI>before the fleet could reach to Bo&s;ton,</HI> as I was told by Sir Francis him&s;elf, 1300 &s;ailors out of 2100, and 1800 &s;oldiers out of 2400."</P>
<P>In book 7. 116, the &s;ame author &s;ays, "there was an En|gli&s;h fleet of our good friends with a direful plague aboard <HI>in|tending hither.</HI> Had they come, as they intended, what an horrible de&s;olation had cut us off, let the de&s;olate places, <HI>that &s;ome of you have &s;een <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the colonies of the &s;outh,</HI> declare unto us. <HI>And that they did not come was the &s;ignal hand of heaven.</HI>" This pa&s;&s;age is in a lecture preached on the 27th of September, 1698.</P>
<P>From this authentic hi&s;tory, written by a cotemporary clergy|man, we infer that Hutchin&s;on mu&s;t have made a mi&s;take. Sir Francis Wheeler's fleet arrived at Bo&s;ton, mo&s;t dreadfully in|fected, but no di&s;ea&s;e was propagated in Bo&s;ton. Some other fleet, it &s;eems, had introduced the di&s;ea&s;e into a "colony of the &s;outh," perhaps Newport or New-York, but I have no in|formation on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The great di&s;charges of fire and earthquakes of 1693, were followed, as u&s;ual, by an inten&s;ely cold winter. The &s;ucceed|ing &s;ummer of 1694 was not and exce&s;&s;ively dry in Italy, till October, when the earth was deluged with rain.</P>

<P>One of the mo&s;t remarkable effects of the late agitations of the elements, was the frequency of apoplexies in Italy.

<P><PB N="211" REF="036687_0215_100AA298ADA62840">The malignant fever already mentioned, whatever might have been its preci&s;e &s;ymptoms, was &s;oon followed by more general &s;ickne&s;s. In 1699 raged in Charle&s;ton South-Carolina and in Philadelphia, the mo&s;t deadly bilious plague that probably ever affected the people of this country.</P>
<P>Mr. Norris of Philadelphia has kindly favored me with a &s;ight of a number of M. S. letters of his grand-father I&s;aac Norris, written during the &s;ickne&s;s, to his corre&s;pondents. This worthy gentleman was then in trade, and well acquainted with the facts re&s;pecting the di&s;ea&s;e, as his own family &s;uffered a lo&s;s of &s;everal of its members.</P>
<P>In a letter dated Augu&s;t 15, 1699, he mentions, that a ma|lignant fever broke out about the beginning of Augu&s;t, which he de&s;cribes as the "Barbadoes di&s;temper," tho he gives no intimations of its being communicated from countries abroad by infection. He &s;ays the patients "vomited and voided blood."</P>
<P>On the 24th of Augu&s;t, arrived the Britannia from Liver|pool, which had been 13 weeks on her pa&s;&s;age; &s;he had 200 pa&s;&s;engers on board&mdash;had lo&s;t fifty by death, and others were &s;ickly.</P>
<P>September 1&s;t, he writes that the di&s;temper appeared to abate at one time, but afterwards revived. He mentions the &s;ummer to be the hotte&s;t he ever knew; men died at harve&s;t in the field. All bu&s;ine&s;s in the city was &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>During the yearly meeting the di&s;ea&s;e abated, but the meeting was thinly attended. Afterwards the di&s;ea&s;e returned in all its violence.</P>
<P>October 9th, he writes that he had hoped the cool weather would have relieved the city, but it did not.</P>
<P>October 22d, the di&s;ea&s;e had abated. Of this epidemic, died two hundred and twenty, of whom eighty or ninety be|longed to the &s;ociety of friends.</P>
<P>The population of Philadelphia at this time, is not exactly a&s;certained; but as the city had been &s;ettled but &s;eventeen years, the number of people could not have been great. If we con|&s;ider that the city was thinly inhabited, and that no con&s;idera|ble artificial cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e had been accumulated; together
<PB N="212" REF="036687_0216_100AA29A7AED28C8">
with the fact of the patient's vomiting and voiding blood, we mu&s;t admit the di&s;ea&s;e to have been extremely virulent, beyond any thing that has marked its returns in &s;ub&s;equent periods.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame letters, Mr. Norris, October 18th, mentions that he had information from Charle&s;ton of the great mortality by the &s;ame fever&mdash;150 had died in a few days, and the &s;urvivors mo&s;tly fled into the country.</P>
<P>In a hi&s;tory of South-Carolina, lately publi&s;hed, there is a more particular account of the calamities that befel Charle&s;ton in this year 1699. A mo&s;t dreadful tempe&s;t, a common event after exce&s;&s;ive heat, threatened a total de&s;truction of the town. The &s;ea &s;welled and ru&s;hed violently into the town, compelling the people to fly to the tops of their hou&s;es for &s;afety. A fire broke out and laid mo&s;t of the town in a&s;hes. The &s;mall-pox proved fatal to many of the youth, and to fill the cup of calam|ity, the bilious plague broke out with &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible mortality, that the principal officers of government, one half of the mem|bers of a&s;&s;embly and multitudes of the citizens fell victims. The&s;e calamities came near to di&s;&s;olve the &s;ettlement.</P>
<BIBL>Hi&s;t. of S. Carolina, vol. 1. 142.</BIBL>
<P>I find no &s;ugge&s;tion that any ve&s;&s;els had arrived from the We&s;t-Indies at the&s;e places, or that any &s;u&s;picion exi&s;ted of the im|portation of this terrible di&s;ea&s;e. At that time, there was very little intercour&s;e directly between Philadelphia or Charle&s;ton and the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>But it will be remarked, that the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appeared about the "beginning of Augu&s;t," as in modern times&mdash;that it once abated, as it did in New-York, both in 1795 and 6, &s;o as to be extingui&s;hed in the latter year, and that for two or three weeks.&mdash;That in 1699 as in later returns of it, it yielded not to cool weather, until late in October. It will be further re|marked, that a &s;evere epidemic catarrh preceded this plague, about eighteen months, as it did in 1789-90.</P>
<P>During this period, other parts of the earth did not e&s;cape affliction. A comet appeared in 1698 and another &s;mall one in 1699; and in this latter year, Lima &s;uffered con&s;iderable damage by an earthquake, as did &s;ome parts of Batavia in the Ea&s;t-Indies.</P>

<P>The &s;ame period was remarkable for failure of crops in A|merica. In a &s;ermon preached in Bo&s;ton on Lecture Day, Sept. 27, 1698, we have the following account of this &s;ubject. "The harve&s;t hath once and again grievou&s;ly failed, in the&s;e years, and we have been &s;truck through with terrible famin.&mdash; The very cour&s;e of nature hath been altered among us; a la|mentable cry for <HI>bread, bread,</HI> hath been heard in our &s;treets."</P>

<P>In the preceding page, of this &s;ermon, it is al&s;o remarked, that "Epidemical &s;ickne&s;&s;es have, in the&s;e years, been once and again upon us," and it is mentioned that Bo&s;ton lo&s;t, in one year, &s;ix or &s;even hundred of its people, by one contagious di&s;|ea&s;e. The year is not &s;pecified.</P>
<P>It will be ob&s;erved that in the hi&s;tory of the la&s;t two centu|ries few in&s;tances of the plague in Egypt and the Levant are mentioned. The rea&s;on is, that I have no regular &s;eries of ac|counts of plague in Egypt or Con&s;tantinople, for the la&s;t two or three hundred years. One remark however I will hazard, on
<PB N="214" REF="036687_0218_100AA2A10CE24F30">
the &s;trength of facts within the pre&s;ent century, that whenever malignant epidemics prevail generally in Europe or America, the plague ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es in Egypt and Con&s;tantinople, or rather a little before; the commencement of the pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air in tho&s;e unhealthy cities being a little anterior to its principal ef|fects in the north of Europe.</P>
<P>At the time of the dreadful bilious plague in Philadelphia and Charle&s;ton ju&s;t before de&s;cribed, the plague was raging in the Levant, and for a year or two after.</P>
<P>During this period, in 1700, the &s;ame pe&s;tilential con&s;titu|tion di&s;played it&s;elf in a mo&s;t de&s;tructive &s;ore throat in the i&s;land of Milo, in the Levant. It is thus de&s;cribed by Tournefort, vol. 1. let. 4. He &s;ays it appeared in a "Carbuncle or plague|&s;ore in the bottom of the throat, attended with a violent fever." It carried off children in two days, but &s;pared adults. He calls it the "child's plague." There appears to be &s;ome pro|priety in giving the di&s;ea&s;e this appellation. It has &s;ome re&s;em|blance to the true pe&s;tis, the ulcer being formed in the throat in|&s;tead of the glands. The in&s;idiou&s;ne&s;s of the di&s;temper is another circum&s;tance of re&s;emblance&mdash;per&s;ons in both di&s;ea&s;es often walking about, a few hours before they expire. But this is a mo&s;t prominent fact, that the ulcerous &s;ore throat, or ma|lignant anginas are rarely or never epidemic, except in periods when the plague and yellow fever prevail in places where they u&s;ually appear. In no in&s;tance has the &s;ore throat been epidemic in America, except when the plague has been raging in Egypt and Con&s;tantinople. At lea&s;t I can find no exception to this remark; and what is more, the virulence of the one di&s;ea&s;e in one country, corre&s;ponds with the malignity of the other di&s;ea&s;e in the other countries. Thus, as the plague in Egypt in 1736, was far more de&s;tructive than the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, at other times, &s;o was the angina maligna of that period in America.</P>
<P>When ob&s;ervation and philo&s;ophy &s;hall prevail over the preju|dices of men in regard to the origin of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es from in|fection, it will be found that the angina, in its various forms, is only a particular &s;tage or modification of the pe&s;tilence, which &s;preads over the world at certain unequal periods. The milder
<PB N="215" REF="036687_0219_100AA2A295973CA8">
forms of the pe&s;tilence appear in catarrh, mea&s;les and chin cough; which u&s;ually appear together, or nearly &s;o, at the beginning of the more virulent general contagion; the later and more fatal &s;tages are marked by anginas, cynanche maligna, petechial fe|ver, bilious and glandular plague in &s;ummer; and pe&s;tilential pleuri&s;ies in winter.</P>
<P>There are certain times, when the con&s;titutions of men in all parts of the world, contract a poi&s;on, which nature makes an effort to expel; and the different epidemics that accompany or follow each other, in rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, appear to be the differ|ent modes by which nature &s;trives to rid the human body of the virus. The&s;e modes depend on the &s;ea&s;on of the year, the con|&s;titution or age of the patient and a multitude of &s;ubordinate circum&s;tances.&mdash;Whether this poi&s;on is a po&s;itive &s;ub&s;tance in|haled by the lungs and pores, or is the effect of mere debility, which unfits the &s;everal parts of the body to perform their func|tions, is a que&s;tion of a curious nature.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that in this year 1700, when this ulcerous &s;ore throat was raging in the Levant I&s;les, &s;mall children in the north of Europe were &s;eized with a &s;uffocating catarrh or catarrh|ous fevers. The&s;e were followed by mild epidemic mea&s;les.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII. Hi&s;torical view of pe&s;tilential epidemics from the year <HI>1701</HI> to <HI>1788.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE year 1701 appears to have been exce&s;&s;ively dry in America. Dr. Ru&s;h relates that during the dry &s;ummer of 1782, a rock in the Skuylkill appeared above the &s;urface of the water, on which were engraven the figures 1701. How little do men &s;u&s;pect the value of this in&s;cription! To this alone I am indebted for the fact of extreme drouth in that year&mdash;and the fact is among the proofs of an extraordinary evaporation, before di&s;|charges of fire and lava from volcanoes. In 1701 was an erup|tion of Ve&s;uvius; in 1702 of Etna. It will hereafter appear that a &s;imilar dry &s;ea&s;on in 1782 preceded the great eruption of Heckla in 1783. Indeed it is a general fact, and as far as I can learn, &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons &s;eldom occur, except during the approach of comets, or antecedent to volcanic eruptions.</P>
<P>This was a pe&s;tilential period. In 1701 Toulon lo&s;t two thirds of its inhabitants by the plague, and the Levant was &s;e|verely affected about the &s;ame time. See the bills of mortality for Aug&s;burg, Dre&s;den and Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>In 1702 appeared a comet; Etna di&s;charged its fires, and in Bo&s;ton raged a malignant &s;mall-pox, attended, in many ca&s;es, with a &s;carlet eruption, which was mi&s;taken for the &s;carlet fever. It appears from Fairfield's diary that this di&s;ea&s;e appeared in June and was at fir&s;t mild, not fatal to any of the patients. In Augu&s;t died one patient&mdash;in September it became very mortal, and in this month was attended with a "&s;ort of fever called &s;carlet fever." In October, many died of the "fever and the &s;mall-pox, and it was a time of &s;ore di&s;tre&s;s," on which account the general court &s;at at Cambridge. In December "the fever
<PB N="217" REF="036687_0221_100AA2A6A8E87538">
abated;" but the &s;mall-pox continued to be mortal, till the month of February 1703, when it began to &s;ub&s;ide.</P>
<P>I have already remarked that eruptive di&s;ea&s;es &s;eem to belong to one family. Phy&s;icians will ob&s;erve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he alliance in their &s;ymp|toms; but I would ob&s;erve that the progre&s;&s;ivene&s;s in this di&s;ea&s;e of 1702 and the variations in its &s;ymptoms, prove it to have been an epidemic, and not the effect of mere infection, or &s;pe|cific contagion.</P>
<P>In this year al&s;o the drouth was extreme. In New-York ra|ged the American plague, which was &s;aid to have been imported from St. Thomas's. By the accounts, this was more fatal than any di&s;ea&s;e &s;ince that period. It was called the "Great Sick|ne&s;s" and hardly a patient &s;urvived. On account of it, the a&s;&s;embly was held at Jamaica on Long-I&s;land.</P>
<BIBL>Smith's Hi&s;t. N. York, p. 104. Journals of A&s;&s;embly, vol. 1. 151.</BIBL>
<P>Such were the epidemics in America which followed the in|fluenza of 1698&mdash;malignant pleuri&s;ies in 1698&mdash;plague in 1699 and in 1702, with virulent &s;mall-pox&mdash;all of unu&s;ual &s;everity. Let the reader compare the&s;e facts with the accounts from Eu|rope and the bills of mortality.</P>
<P>The winter of 1702-3 was variable&mdash;&s;evere fro&s;t and great &s;nows, with intervals of warm weather. In &s;pring catarrh prevail|ed in England, followed by a &s;ickly &s;ummer, with earthquakes.</P>
<P>In January and February 1703 were &s;evere &s;hocks of earth|quake in Rome, Naples and other parts of Italy. In October a memorable tempe&s;t or hurricane, which did great damage at &s;ea, and injured buildings on land.</P>
<P>In 1704 the &s;ummer was very dry, and a mo&s;t malignant &s;potted fever raged in Aug&s;burg and in Pru&s;&s;ia. Flies were in great abundance, and there was an eruption of Ve&s;uvius. The la&s;t eruption of the volcano in Teneriffe was in this year, &s;ince which it has di&s;charged &s;moke, but no fire.</P>
<P>Note. A late arrival from Teneriffe brings an account of the bur&s;ting forth of a volcano, in June la&s;t, which continued, till the ve&s;&s;el left the i&s;land in Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>In December 1705 were many mo&s;t violent tempe&s;ts and in|undations. The tide ro&s;e in the Loir in France 25 feet beyond

its u&s;ual height. Half of Limerick in Ireland was laid under water. The&s;e &s;torms indicated the approach of a comet, which appeared in the following year.</P>
<P>In 1706 coughs and coryzas prevailed, and dy&s;entery fatal among children.</P>
<P>A &s;mall &s;hock of earthquake was felt in America in 1705.</P>
<P>In 1707 appeared another comet and &s;ubterranean fire was uncommonly agitated. Ve&s;uvius di&s;charged fire, and a new i&s;land was thrown up in the Archipelago, with an earthquake and volcano. The &s;ea&s;ons in this and the following year were variable.</P>
<BIBL>Buffon's Nat. Hi&s;t.</BIBL>
<P>In November 1708 began a mo&s;t &s;evere and univer&s;al catarrh in Europe, which was &s;peedily followed by a &s;eries of pe&s;tilen|tial di&s;ea&s;es. Of this catarrh, of the &s;ea&s;ons, and the plagues that followed we have from Europe very correct accounts; but, with the utmo&s;t indu&s;try, I cannot learn whether the catarrh extended to America.</P>
<P>The explo&s;ion of &s;ubterranean fire in various places in 1707 &s;eems to have been the commencement of this period; altho there was a plague in the ea&s;tern parts of Europe, mo&s;t of the preceding years from 1700. A meteor pa&s;&s;ed over England, near the mouth of the Thames, July 31, 1708, a few months before the catarrh.</P>
<P>The winter of 1708-9 was the &s;evere&s;t that had happened, af|ter 1683-4. But it appears that the catarrh commenced two months before the &s;evere cold began. At lea&s;t this epidemic appeared in the north of Europe, as early as November; whereas the autumn was one of the milde&s;t, till January, that was ever known. Then the weather changed &s;udde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly to mo&s;t &s;evere cold and continued for a number of weeks.</P>
<BIBL>Short, vol. 1. Lanci&s;ius, p. 194 and &s;eq.</BIBL>
<P>This catarrh is carefully de&s;cribed by Lanci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ius as it appeared in Italy. In Rome it commenced in January, but increa&s;ed afterwards, as the cold abated. It began with coryza, rheumata and &s;light cough, and was attended with pains in the brea&s;t, angina, pleuri&s;ies and peripneumonies, which prevailed greatly in the &s;pring, among tho&s;e who neglected the cough, or u&s;ed a full diet.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="036687_0223_100AA2AC1CEA2150">Symptoms of this catarrh were, la&s;&s;itude, fever with chills, wandering pains in the brea&s;t, continued cough, hard pul&s;e, flame-colored or turbid urine, &s;pitting of blood and difficult re&s;|piration. The cheeks were red and the body &s;uffured with a yellow color, like that of the jaundice.</P>

To my mind the fact is rather an evidence that the e&s;cape of pri&s;oners is owing to a different, perhaps a le&s;s &s;timulant condition of the air they breathe. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould e&s;cape expo&s;ure to infection, when every one around them is affected.

Many recovered by means of &s;weats or hemorrhagy at the no&s;e, or di&s;charges from the bowels, or copious di&s;charges of urine, or by all the&s;e evacuations, accompanied by &s;pitting a thick phlegm. Vene&s;ection was beneficial, e&s;pecially in robu&s;t con&s;ti|tutions. On di&s;&s;ection, the precordia appeared of a reddi&s;h color, extending to the diaphragm&mdash;and di&s;colored by &s;pots of blacki&s;h thick blood&mdash;polypu&s;&s;es were di&s;covered in the great ve&s;|&s;els of the heart.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e did not entirely di&s;appear till June.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of 1708 preceding the &s;evere winter and ca|tarrh, gnats appeared in prodigious &s;warms.</P>
<P>The winter of 1708-9 killed fruit-trees, vines and corn. After this exce&s;&s;ive cold, multitudes of people died of apoplex|ies, and others were &s;eized with vertigoes, arthritics, pleuri&s;ies, inflammatory fevers of all kinds, and con&s;umptions. This &s;e|verity of cold extended over America as well as Europe, in the &s;ame winter.</P>
<P>A pe&s;tilence raged in the north of Europe from the years 1702 to 1711, of which we have an account in Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, No. 337.</P>

<P>It has been ob&s;erved already that the plague raged in the Le|vant, in the fir&s;t years of the pre&s;ent century. In 1702, the &s;ame year, it will be noted, in which the terrible &s;mall-pox raged
<PB N="220" REF="036687_0224_100AA2ADA65D6558">
in Bo&s;ton and bilious plague in New-York, the plague broke out in Poland, near Pickzow, &s;oon after an unfortunate battle be|tween the Swedes and Saxons. No &s;ugge&s;tion appears that the di&s;ea&s;e was caught by infection from a di&s;tant country, nor that the fetor of dead carca&s;es was &s;uppo&s;ed to generate the di&s;tem|per. On the&s;e important points we are left in the dark. All that is recorded is, that it <HI>fir&s;t began</HI> near Pickzow in Poland, &s;oon after a battle. It &s;pread in 1703, 4 and 5 over Poland, and into parts of Hungary and Ru&s;&s;ia, &s;weeping away va&s;t num|bers of inhabitants. In 1706 we hear nothing of it. In 1707 it broke out in War&s;aw, with great mortality. In 1708 it ap|peared in Thorn, and parts of Poli&s;h Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>This approach of the di&s;ea&s;e alarmed the people of Dantzick &mdash;public prayers were ordered in the churches&mdash;all commerce and communication with infected places were forbid&mdash;no mer|chandize from infected or &s;u&s;pected places was permitted to enter the city, and the magi&s;trates neglected no mea&s;ure that could guard the public &s;afety. All travellers and &s;trangers were &s;trict|ly examined, and none permitted to enter without &s;ufficient proofs that they came from healthy and uninfected places. The&s;e and other &s;trict regulations were enjoined in July 1708; but notwith&s;tanding the&s;e precautions, "the di&s;temper gradually in&s;inuated it&s;elf, for in March 1709, there died out of one di&s;|trict in the old town &s;even per&s;ons, and another per&s;on, being ill, was &s;ent to the ho&s;pital, where the di&s;ea&s;e &s;oon &s;pread." Dr. Gottwald, the author of this account, vi&s;ited the ho&s;pital on the 16th of the &s;ame month, and found many per&s;ons ill&mdash;"&s;ome had buboes, others carbuncles, others gangrenous ulcers, which he could not determin to be pe&s;tilential, but which he judged to be &s;ymptoms, if not of the plague already commenced, at <HI>lea&s;t of &s;omething, but little inferior to it, and certain forerunners of that de&s;tructive di&s;temper.</HI>"</P>
<P>In the preceding account, we ob&s;erve the utter in&s;ufficiency of laws and regulations to prevent the introduction of the plague into cities; and the uncertainty of phy&s;icians at fir&s;t as to the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e.

malignant fevers to the real plague. I have no bills of the mor|tality in Dantzick for the preceding years, but if any &s;uch are on record, it will appear, that the approach of the plague was indicated in that city by malignant di&s;ea&s;es and increa&s;ed mortal|ity, for &s;ome months or perhaps a year or two preceding.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread &s;lowly at fir&s;t, but in July and Augu&s;t be|came general&mdash;it was at its height in September, and gradually declined till the clo&s;e of the year. The number of victims was nearly 25,000.</P>
<P>From the very accurate hi&s;tory of this pe&s;tilence by Dr. Gottwald, the following circum&s;tances are to be collected.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That the di&s;temper fir&s;t made its appearance in a part of the old town, called Raumbaum. What its &s;ituation is, may be &s;een in Bu&s;ching; a part of the city built on a &s;tream which falls into the Vi&s;tula&mdash;low of cour&s;e&mdash;a place of bu&s;ine&s;s, and its &s;treets dirty.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The di&s;ea&s;e, after its fir&s;t appearance, lay lurking for a long time, in the &s;uburbs of the city, and its progre&s;s was not perceivable, for two or three months. This corre&s;ponds with its phenomena in London and other places; and proves that cold or favorable weather &s;u&s;pends or checks the action of the pe&s;tilential principle.</P>
<P N="3">3d. It was mo&s;t fatal to the poor&mdash;people in good condition mo&s;tly e&s;caped. The &s;ame was ob&s;erved at Copenhagen in 1711.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Its decrea&s;e was gradual, as well as its increa&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Many of the inhabitants, tho they took never &s;o much care to avoid the di&s;temper, kept at home, &s;uffered no infected per&s;on to approach them, and u&s;ed all manner of pre&s;ervatives, "yet caught the infection."</P>
<P N="6">6th. The di&s;ea&s;e was preceded, in 1708, by extraordinary numbers of &s;piders. The &s;ame pre&s;age has been ob&s;erved on other occa&s;ions.</P>
<P N="7">7th. While this di&s;temper was raging, on the 11th of Au|gu&s;t, an offen&s;ive mi&s;t was ob&s;erved, like a thick cloud, but of &s;hort duration. It returned in the afternoon, from the north|we&s;t, &s;o thick as to darken the air. Its color was that of the effluvia from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fferve&s;cence of the oil of vitriol with oil of tartar, a blacki&s;h yellow.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="222" REF="036687_0226_100AA2B1EB6C5928">8th. In the beginning of October appeared over the city a blue fiery globe or meteor, which came from the north we&s;t, in the night, &s;hot towards the town rapidly, illuminating the city, and fell to the &s;outh.</P>
<P N="9">9th. Crows, &s;parrows and other birds did not make their ap|pearance during the pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>In 1708 and 9 the plague de&s;olated Livonia. In 1710 the di&s;ea&s;e appeared in Sweden; 30,000 per&s;ona peri&s;hed by it in Stockholm, and other parts of the kingdom did not e&s;cape. Hi&s;torians relate, that in the latter part of the la&s;t century and beginning of the pre&s;ent, the &s;weating &s;ickne&s;s and great plague in Sweden de&s;troyed &s;everal hundred thou&s;and lives, in con&s;e|quence of which Sweden is le&s;s populous than formerly.</P>

<P>In 1711 Copenhagen lo&s;t 25,000 citizens by the &s;ame mal|ady.</P>
<P>It is proper to remark how exten&s;ively pe&s;tilence prevailed af|ter the great catarrh and terribly &s;evere winter of 1709.</P>
<P>Nor did America e&s;cape the operation of the general princi|ple. A body of troops under Gen. Nichol&s;on, de&s;tined to co|operate with a fleet from England, in the reduction of Canada, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">camped near Wood Creek in the province of New-York, and in July and Augu&s;t were attacked with a di&s;temper which made dreadful havoc and obliged them to decamp. Some of the men died as if they had been poi&s;oned. This circum&s;tance gave ri&s;e to a report which Charlevoix gravely relates, that the In|dians had poi&s;oned the water of the creek, by throwing into it all the &s;kins of bea&s;ts they had taken in hunting. The di&s;ea&s;e was probably the lake fever or a malignant dy&s;entery. This happened in 1709.</P>

<P>In 1712 and 13, the plague was epidemic in Vienna, Hun|gary, Stiria and other ea&s;tern countries. This di&s;ea&s;e was pre|ceded by the &s;potted fever, which gradually changed to plague. At the &s;ame time, whole countries were overrun with in&s;ects.</P>

<P>In England prevailed a fever which Mead has pronounced to have been of the &s;ame kind, as the &s;weating &s;ickne&s;s in the &s;ix|teenth century.&mdash;He &s;ays it was imported from Dunkirk, but how it came to be in Dunkirk, he does not inform us.</P>
<P>During the&s;e calamities among men, the bea&s;ts of the field did not e&s;cape. A fatal di&s;temper among cattle broke out in 1711 and raged with &s;uch violence, in Italy, as almo&s;t to de&s;troy the &s;pecies. It &s;pread for three or four years, and hor&s;es peri&s;hed by a &s;imilar pe&s;tilence. The writers who de&s;cribe the di&s;ea&s;e,

<P>In 1720 happened the la&s;t great plague in Mar&s;eilles, on which occa&s;ion has been publi&s;hed "Trait&eacute; de la pe&s;te," a treati&s;e in quarto, by Chicoyneau, under the &s;anction of the French king, in which great efforts are made to prove the di&s;ea&s;e to have been imported from the Levant.</P>
<P>The proofs of importation &s;tand thus. "Capt. Chataud left Said in Syria in January 1720, with a clean patent. The plague was not then in Said, tho it broke out &s;oon after. On the pa&s;&s;age, &s;everal per&s;ons died, and the phy&s;icians at Leghorn, where the &s;hip &s;topped, pronounced their di&s;ea&s;e to be "a ma|lignant pe&s;tilential fever."</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="036687_0230_100AA2BD876E09E0">The &s;hip arrived at Mar&s;eilles, and &s;ome per&s;ons who had concern with the goods, died in May. The &s;u&s;pected goods were &s;ubjected to fifteen days retreat and purification&mdash;they were forbid to be introduced into the city&mdash;the porters were &s;hut up; but all regulations were fruitle&s;s. In June, deaths appeared in the city with di&s;tinctive marks of the plague."</P>
<P>On &s;uch flim&s;ey evidence do the &s;ticklers for the &s;ole propa|gation of the plague by infection, ground all their a&s;&s;ertions re&s;|pecting the di&s;ea&s;e at Mar&s;eilles!</P>
<P>But it happens in this ca&s;e, as in mo&s;t &s;imilar in&s;tances, that the pretended proofs of infection carry refutation in the very face of them.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is an acknowledged fact, that at the time the &s;hip left Said, the plague had not appeared in that port, or town. It was at Aleppo and in other places far di&s;tant in 1719, but had not broke out in Said. How, in the name of rea&s;on, could men or goods be infected, when the di&s;ea&s;e did not exi&s;t in the place?</P>
<P>To overcome or rather to evade the force of this objection, the writers on the &s;ubject are compelled to re&s;ort to <HI>&s;uppo&s;ition.</HI> They &s;ay it is <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> the plague might have been in the place, tho not known or generally admitted. And here re&s;ts their whole argument!</P>
<P>It is true, that &s;ome of the &s;eamen or pa&s;&s;engers died on the pa&s;&s;age, with a malignant pe&s;tilential fever. But in this ca&s;e, the malady originated on board the &s;hip&mdash;and the infection is not traced to the Levant ports. There is an end of the chain&mdash;the di&s;ea&s;e began <HI>without infection,</HI> on board the &s;hip, as malignant fevers have done in thou&s;ands of other &s;hips.</P>
<P>Again, it is admitted by Dr. Mead him&s;elf, p. 255, that from the time of the &s;ailors' death, after the &s;hip arrived, it was full &s;ix weeks before the di&s;ea&s;e was known in the city of Mar|&s;eilles; a circum&s;tance that renders it nearly impo&s;&s;ible that there could have been any propagation of the di&s;temper by infection. To remove this objection, the advocates of infection again re&s;ort <HI>to &s;uppo&s;ition.</HI> They <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> it po&s;&s;ible &s;ome latent &s;eeds of the di&s;ea&s;e had been concealed in goods, or clothes&mdash;and &s;uch ridic|ulous &s;ugge&s;tions are made the grounds of a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="036687_0231_100AA2BF0FB42FF8">But what completely refutes all the&s;e idle &s;uppo&s;itions, is, that we have full evidence, that the plague in Mar&s;eilles was generat|ed in the city, and gradually aro&s;e from milder di&s;ea&s;es. In the beginning of the "Trait&egrave; de la pe&s;te," it is &s;tated from Mon. Didier and not denied, that "the preceding year 1719 was a barren year&mdash;the corn, the wine and the oil, were defec|tive. The heat of &s;pring was exce&s;&s;ive and followed by great rains, with we&s;terly winds&mdash;the fruits were bad. In this year a pe&s;tilential fever appeared in Mar&s;eilles, of which many died, and <HI>in &s;ome, appeared buboes, carbuncles and paroitides.</HI>"</P>
<P>Here we ob&s;erve facts that always exi&s;t, before the plague, and which demon&s;trate the uniform operations of the laws of nature. The year 1718 began to exhibit malignant di&s;ea&s;es in greater numbers than u&s;ual. In 1719 the plague broke out at Aleppo, and in the north and we&s;t of Europe, malignant fevers became in many places, epidemic and pe&s;tilential. In 1720, the pe&s;tilential &s;tate of the air, arrived at its cri&s;is in Mar&s;eilles. The pe&s;tilence in Europe exhibited a <HI>regular progre&s;s,</HI> from or|dinary typhus fever to the plague. A fatal &s;mall-pox and &s;pot|ted fever prevailed in Piemont.</P>
<P>To demon&s;trate this fact, the reader will only turn to the bills of mortality in London, Am&s;terdam, Vienna, Dre&s;den, &amp;c. for the years under con&s;ideration, and ob&s;erve every where the effects of a general unhealthy &s;tate of air, in the increa&s;e of the number of deaths.&mdash;The bills of mortality in Bo&s;ton and Phila|delphia al&s;o prove this &s;tate of air to have extended to this coun|try; and the malignancy of it &s;eems to have abated in America after 1721, in which year the &s;mall-pox was very mortal in Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>The accounts of di&s;ea&s;es in America, at this period, are few and imperfect. Tradition has pre&s;erved the memory of de&s;ola|ting &s;ickne&s;s, at various times and in various places, &s;ome of which, I &s;u&s;pect, refer to this period, but I am not able to a&s;|certain the dates, with any certainty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My father mentions an in&s;tance, which he believes to have been not long before his birth, which was in 1722.

<P>In 1729 appeared a comet, and in autumn a univer&s;al catarrh in Europe, and perhaps over the globe. This was preceded by mea&s;les. It &s;eized with a &s;light chill, a &s;low fever, weari|ne&s;s, continual hoar&s;ene&s;s, pain of the head, and difficulty of breathing. The &s;uddenne&s;s of the attack was a&s;toni&s;hing, and it proved fatal to many aged and phlegmatic people. Many pleuri&s;ies and peripneumonies followed. Its fir&s;t appearance was in Poland, Au&s;tria and Sile&s;ia, and it marched over Europe in five months. At the clo&s;e of this epidemic in 1730, Ve&s;uvius di&s;charged its contents of fire.</P>
<P>In this year 1729 the plague was in Aleppo, and it will be &s;een that the bills of mortality in the north of Europe exhibit a &s;ickly &s;tate, through a period of many years at this time. The mea&s;les prevailed in America, and in Farmington, Connecticut, a malignant pleuri&s;y.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer of 1729 was in mo&s;t parts of England, very wet, in other parts, dry; but this made no difference in the prevalence of the catarrh. The &s;mall-pox was very frequent in England.</P>

<P>This epidemic &s;eems to have been the precur&s;or of the mo&s;t pe&s;tilential period of this century. The &s;ummer of 1733, in England, was dry and plea&s;ant. The winter following was very mild. The plague raged at Aleppo.</P>

<P>While the&s;e epidemics were prevailing in Europe, America felt the pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air. In May 1735, in a wet cold &s;ea&s;on, appeared at King&s;ton, an inland town in New-Hamp|&s;hire, &s;ituated in a low plain, a di&s;ea&s;e among children, commonly called the "throat di&s;temper," of a mo&s;t malignant kind, and by far the mo&s;t fatal ever known in this country. Its &s;ymptoms generally were, a &s;welled throat, with white or a&s;h-colored &s;pecks, an efflore&s;cence on the &s;kin, great debility of the whole &s;y&s;tem, and a tendency to putridity.</P>
<P>It fir&s;t &s;eized a child, who died in three days. In about a week afterwards, three children, in another family, at a di&s;tance of four miles, were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;eized and all died on the third day. It continued to &s;pread, and of the fir&s;t forty patients, not one recovered.</P>
<P>In Augu&s;t, it appeared at Exeter, a town &s;ix miles di&s;tant. In September, it broke out in Bo&s;ton, fifty miles di&s;tant; altho' it did not appear in Che&s;ter &s;ix miles we&s;t of King&s;ton, till Octo|ber. &mdash;It continued its ravages, through that year into the next, and gradually travelled &s;outhward, almo&s;t &s;tripping the country of children. Very few children e&s;caped, for altho' the di&s;ea&s;e was very infectious, yet its propagation depended very little on that circum&s;tance. It attacked the young in the mo&s;t &s;eque&s;ter|ed &s;ituations, and without a po&s;&s;ible communication with the &s;ick. It was literally the <HI>plague among children.</HI> Many families lo&s;t three and four children&mdash;many lo&s;t all.</P>
<P>In &s;ome places, this di&s;temper was more fatal than in others&mdash;
<PB N="234" REF="036687_0238_100AA2D02BEC7608">
country towns &s;uffered more than populous cities. And it &s;hould be here remarked, that the virulence of this &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e &s;eems at times to be greatly augmented by cold and wet weather &mdash;it is mo&s;t mild in cities where the air is, in a degree, correc|ted of its rigor and moi&s;ture.&mdash;To this ob&s;ervation however there are exceptions.</P>
<P>Scorbutic people and tho&s;e who lived on pork, and of cour&s;e the poor, &s;uffered mo&s;t. In &s;ome families, it was comparatively mild&mdash;in others it was malignant like a plague. This di&s;ea&s;e gradually travelled we&s;tward and was two years in reaching the river Hud&s;on, di&s;tant from King&s;ton, where it fir&s;t appeared, a|bout 200 miles in a &s;trait line. It continued its progre&s;s we&s;t|ward, with &s;ome interruptions, until it &s;pread over the colonies. Few adults were affected; its principal ravages were among per|&s;ons under age, or rather under puberty. For many years after it was epidemic, it frequently broke out in different places with|out any apparent cau&s;e, but did not &s;pread&mdash;a &s;triking proof that &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es will not become <HI>epidemic</HI> by the &s;ole power of <HI>in|fection,</HI> but that &s;ome <HI>general cau&s;e</HI> mu&s;t aid its propagation, or it will peri&s;h in its cradle. This is probably true of every &s;pecies of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>From an elderly lady of great ob&s;ervation in New-Haven, I have learnt that per&s;ons who, recovered of this di&s;temper, were &s;ubject, all their lives, to &s;ore throat and quin&s;ies, and what is perhaps more remarkable, that few or none of them have lived to be old. It is at lea&s;t apparent, in the &s;phere of her ob&s;erva|tion, that tho&s;e per&s;ons have died at an earlier age than others. The&s;e facts are &s;triking proofs how much the whole &s;y&s;tem, and e&s;pecially the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e, was impaired in &s;trength and firmne&s;s, by that di&s;tre&s;&s;ing malady. A gentleman &s;till living, who was affected with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e in 1742, informs me that his con&s;titution has never recovered from the &s;hock it received from that malady.</P>
<P>The inva&s;ion of this di&s;temper was gradual, and for &s;ome time before its attack, children appeared to langui&s;h. It was not always attended with great pro&s;tration of &s;trength, for per|&s;ons

<P>In 1736, and during the rage of the ulcerous &s;ore throat in America and in England, the plague made terrible havoc in E|gypt &mdash;authors relate that Cairo lo&s;t 10,000 per&s;ons in a day.&mdash; In Nimeguen raged a malignant dy&s;entery.</P>
<P>In 1737 while the angina maligna was &s;preading over the northern parts of America, the bilious plague prevailed in Vir|ginia. In England and Scotland, the mea&s;les broke out and prevailed in 1735 and 6, cotemporary with the angina in Amer|ica.

took the form of mea&s;les of a bad type, with hoar&s;ene&s;s, defluxions and catarrh. The catarrh prevailed al&s;o in Barbadoes in the clo&s;e of this year and beginning of the next, and in New-England was a great death of fi&s;h and water fowl.</P>
<P>In 1738 &s;udden deaths, vertigoes and apoplexies followed the preceding epidemics in England. The plague raged at Ockza|kow, at Barbadoes, and in New-Spain the pe&s;tilence was &s;o gen|eral and mortal, as to threaten the country with depopulation.</P>

The bodies of &s;ome of the patients were yellow&mdash;the cri&s;is of the di&s;ea&s;e was the ninth day; if the patient &s;urvived that day, he had a good chance for recovery. The di&s;ea&s;e left many in a &s;tate of imbecility of mind, approaching to childi&s;hne&s;s or idio|cy; others were afterwards troubled with &s;welled legs.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e began in Augu&s;t, ended with fro&s;t, and carried off forty-five inhabitants mo&s;tly men of robu&s;t bodies. It was &s;aid to be imported.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="036687_0244_100AA2DD02A38980">As this was unu&s;ual di&s;ea&s;e in Albany, ingenuity was occu|pied to find out its origin. It was <HI>reported</HI> that a like di&s;ea&s;e pre|vailed in New-York, and that it had been imported in a ve&s;&s;el from Ireland. Nervous, yellow fever imported from Ireland! Such are the vulgar tales that di&s;grace this age of &s;cience and philo&s;ophy. From what fairy land were imported the malignant di&s;ea&s;es, which every where &s;welled the bills of mortality in the &s;ame year?&mdash;Not that I would in&s;inuate that di&s;ea&s;es of a certain kind are not infectious. A pe&s;tilential fever originated in the Chebucto fleet, under the Duke D'Anville, which landed an ar|my on our &s;hores in this &s;ame year, and one third of the Indians who vi&s;ited the cantonments, died. There the di&s;ea&s;e &s;ub&s;ided, without becoming epidemic.</P>

<P>This di&s;ea&s;e was a&s;cribed to the draining of the pond or &s;wamp, mentioned under the year 1750. But to this explana|tion, there are &s;trong, if not in&s;uperable objections.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The fever began in November; but this is the month when the mar&s;h fevers of our climate di&s;appear. I doubt whether the effluvia from mar&s;hes ever act upon the human body, &s;o as to produce di&s;ea&s;e, without a greater degree of heat than Con|necticut ever experiences in the month of November. Cold puts an end to all mar&s;h fevers, but this di&s;ea&s;e continued to in|crea&s;e in December, and did not cea&s;e till late in the winter.</P>
<P>Secondly. This di&s;ea&s;e was called a malignant pleuri&s;y; but mar&s;h effluvia are not known to produce fevers of that de&s;crip|tion. They are common on high, as well as on low grounds, as I can prove by facts in America.</P>
<P>Thirdly. There is no nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;orting to mar&s;h exha|lations for the &s;ource of this malady. The &s;ame &s;pecies of fever prevailed in that winter and the &s;pring following, in many other parts of Connecticut, where no mar&s;h exi&s;ted. In Hartford it

In Ea&s;t-Haven died about forty-five men in the prime of life, mo&s;tly heads of families. The &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e prevailed in New-Haven among the inhabitants, and &s;tu|dents in college.</P>
<P>It is obvious then that this was an epidemic, very well known in &s;ickly periods, and not dependent on local cau&s;es. From Dr. Trumbull of North-Haven I have the following remarks on the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The blood was very thick and &s;izy; often i&s;&s;uing from the no&s;e and &s;ometimes from the eyes. The inflammation was vio|lent, and &s;oon produced delirium. The mo&s;t robu&s;t bodies were mo&s;t liable to the di&s;ea&s;e. A free u&s;e of the lancet, in the early &s;tages of the di&s;order, was the only effectual remedy; where the phy&s;icians were afraid to bleed, the patients all died.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Hugh William&s;on, in the &s;econd volume of the Medical Re|po&s;itory, has de&s;cribed this &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e, which, he &s;ays, prevails often in Carolina in winter, e&s;pecially among tho&s;e who have been af|fected by bilious fevers in the preceding autumn. He ob&s;erves that bleeding is u&s;ually pernicious in that di&s;ea&s;e. Perhaps a difference of climates may make different remedies nece&s;&s;ary. But in different pe|riods, the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e may require different treatment. In New-Eng|land, that fever has u&s;ually demanded an early u&s;e of the lancet.</NOTE> This malady prevailed from November 1760 to March 1761.</P>
<P>I cannot learn that this &s;pecies of inflammatory fever, has ever been epidemic in the northern parts of America, &s;ince this period. But it is a common winter fever, in the Carolinas, af|ter &s;ickly &s;ummers; and in the northern &s;tates, &s;poradic ca&s;es of it occur with all its formidable &s;ymptoms. In&s;tances will be hereafter mentioned. It is the pe&s;tilence of winter, and rarely, if ever appears, except when pe&s;tilential epidemics are current in &s;ummer. And I am not without &s;u&s;picions that the debility occa&s;ioned by mar&s;h effluvia in &s;ummer may predi&s;po&s;e the &s;y&s;tem to that fever in winter, tho not nece&s;&s;ary to produce it.</P>

<P>"The di&s;temper began in April, and in May ran into a ma|lignant fever, which proved fatal to aged people. It &s;pread over the whole country and the We&s;t-India i&s;lands.

<P>In May, the aged who had before e&s;caped, were &s;eized with an affection like a &s;light cold; this, in a day or two was fol|lowed by great pro&s;tration of &s;trength, a cough, labo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of breath|ing, pains about the brea&s;t, praecordia, and in the limbs, but not acute. The countenance betrayed no great marks of febrile heat. The matter expectorated was thin, but &s;limy. As the di&s;ea&s;e advanced, the difficulty of breathing encrea&s;ed; the ex|pectoration was more difficult; the matter thrown off more vi&s;cid; at length the lungs appeared to be &s;o loaded with tena|cious matter, that no efforts could di&s;lodge it, and the patient &s;unk under it.</P>
<P>This di&s;order carried with it bilious appearances&mdash;the coun|tenances of &s;ome patients were of a yellowi&s;h hue. In &s;ome, there was an appearance of indifference or in&s;en&s;ibility; and at night, a &s;light delirium."</P>

<P>The &s;ummer of 1763 was a moi&s;t and unkindly &s;ea&s;on. In Augu&s;t the Indians on Nantucket were attacked by the bilious plague, and between that time and February following, their number was reduced from 358 to 136. Of 258 who were af|fected, 36 only recovered. The di&s;ea&s;e began with high fever and ended in typhus, in about five days. It appeared to be in|fectious among the Indians only; for no whites were attacked, altho they a&s;&s;ociated freely with the di&s;ea&s;ed. Per&s;ons of a mixed blood were attacked, but recovered.

The inva&s;ion was, in many ca&s;es &s;udden, &s;ays Zimmerman, without any preceding &s;ymptom; but more generally its approach was indicated by chills, la&s;&s;itude and other premonitory &s;igns. In its progre&s;s, it exhibited mo&s;t of the &s;ymptoms of the yellow fever of America. It was pre|ceded by a putrid fever, which yielded to the dy&s;entery in June.</P>
<BIBL>See Zimmerman on Dy&s;entery.</BIBL>
<P>This epidemic was followed by violent and malignant pleuri|&s;ies; a circum&s;tance that marks its alliance with the pe&s;tilential fever of America, and probably of all temperate climates, which is al&s;o &s;ucceeded by pleuri&s;y or peripneumony in winter.</P>
<P>In 1765 were many earthquakes in Italy, and Sweden, and a volcanic eruption at Truxillo in Spani&s;h America. Dy&s;entery prevailed in Scotland, and intermittents in Penn&s;ylvania and Georgia, were univer&s;al.</P>
<P>In 1766 the &s;ummer was every where hot and in Europe ex|ce&s;&s;ively dry. In Germany, the Rhine was lower than in the terrible drouth of 1476, and in many places, was forded. In Scotland, the people were compelled to kill their cattle for want of fodder. The heat and drouth produced great hail &s;torms, and in autumn, were followed by inundations, one of which at Montauban, in France, &s;wept away 1200 hou&s;es. Terrible tem|pe&s;ts marked the year, and in the We&s;t-Indies, tho&s;e hurricanes which lay the i&s;lands wa&s;te, and are recorded among the memo|rabilia of the climate.

<P>The winter preceding this remarkable &s;ummer, was extremely cold in Europe. At Rati&s;bon, Reaumur's thermometer was two degrees lower, than in the noted year 1709, and birds per|i&s;hed with cold. At Naples, the &s;now lay in the &s;treets, to the depth of 18 inches, and Ve&s;uvius began to di&s;charge &s;moke, the harbinger of an explo&s;ion. At Li&s;bon, Reaumur's ther|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ometer was 3&frac12; degrees below the freezing point, and at Mad|rid, people &s;kated on the ice.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarkable phenomena preceded and attended a gene|ral di&s;charge of fire and lava, from the three well known volca|noes, Etna, Ve&s;uvius and Heckla, which took place in 1766. This is one of the few in&s;tances on record, in which the&s;e vol|canoes have been in eruption, nearly at the &s;ame time. The eruption of Heckla continued from April to September.

<P>In 1770, cotemporary with the clouds of flies in India and a mo&s;t fatal pe&s;tilence among men and cattle in Europe, appeared in America a black worm about one inch and a half in length, which devoured the gra&s;s and corn. Never was a more &s;ingular phenomenon. The&s;e animals were generated &s;uddenly in the northern &s;tates of America, and almo&s;t covered two or three hundred miles of country. They all moved nearly in one direc|tion, and when they were intercepted by furrows, in plowed land, they fell into them in &s;uch numbers as to form heaps.

<P>It is remarkable that the prim in America began to decay and peri&s;h about this period; and near the &s;ame time, the wheat in&s;ect fir&s;t appeared on Long-I&s;land.</P>

<P>About this time, for the year is not recollected, there was an eruption of fire at Derby, in Connecticut, a few rods from Nau|gatuck river; the only in&s;tance ever known in that place. It happened on a &s;teep bank where it made a large excavation in the earth, throwing trees and &s;tones to &s;ome di&s;tance. A light was &s;een on the &s;pot in the evening before the explo&s;ion. It was accompanied with a loud report, and &s;ome fo&s;&s;il &s;ub&s;tances were ejected, which were analized by Dr. Mon&s;on of New-Haven, and found to contain ar&s;enic and &s;ulphur.</P>

<P>During this &s;ickly period al&s;o, the oy&s;ters on the &s;hores of Connecticut were in an unhealthy &s;tate, and &s;ometimes excited vomiting in tho&s;e who ate of them.</P>
<P>It is remarkable al&s;o that in 1776 the lob&s;ters in the vicinity of York-I&s;land, all di&s;appeared. This event has generally been a&s;cribed to the firing of cannon in the &s;ummer of that year. But the place where they lived being many miles from the Briti&s;h &s;hipping, this explanation is not &s;atisfactory. It is more proba|ble that they peri&s;hed, or abandoned the ground, on account of the bad &s;tate of their element.</P>
<P>The winter in 1776 was &s;evere in Europe. The cold ex|ceeded that of 1740. In Denmark the &s;ound was frozen and cro&s;&s;ed on &s;ledges. The Thames was al&s;o frozen.</P>
<BIBL>An. Regi&s;ter, 1776. 114.</BIBL>
<P>The &s;ummer of 1776 in America was hot and in the northern &s;tates rainy. The dy&s;entery was prevalent in all parts of the country, and was terribly fatal to the American troops in New-York and at Ticonderoga. I was at Mount Independence in October, and witne&s;s to the ravages of the di&s;ea&s;e. Of thirteen thou&s;and troops, it was &s;aid that one half were unfit for duty.</P>
<P>It has been cu&s;tomary to a&s;cribe the prevalence of this mortal di&s;ea&s;e to infection &s;pread by the &s;oldiers who returned home from the armies. It is certain that the di&s;ea&s;e was thus introdu|ced into particular families; but infection was the &s;malle&s;t among the cau&s;es of the epidemic. In mo&s;t places, it originated with|out any communication from the army; and I was a witne&s;s of &s;uch in&s;tances. The di&s;ea&s;e was the effect of a particular &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, aided by the &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>To prove how unfounded is the opinion that the di&s;ea&s;e ori|ginated in the army alone, and &s;pread from that as from a focus, it will be &s;ufficient to mention two facts. The fir&s;t is, that this epidemic commenced in 1773, <HI>two years before the war,</HI> in which year it was more malignant and fatal, in &s;ome places, than in any &s;ub&s;equent year. Witne&s;s New-Haven, Ea&s;t-Haven and Salem in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="036687_0268_100AA24FD2769BB8">In 1775 a remarkable fact occurred. About one hundred men belonging to Danbury, in Connecticut, went to join the army on Lake Champlain; they performed their duty and all returned in good health. While they were ab&s;ent, the dy&s;en|tery invaded the town and carried off more than one hundred of the inhabitants. In this in&s;tance, not a &s;oldier returned from the army, until the di&s;ea&s;e had &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>The &s;econd fact is, that the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e has before raged gen|erally in this country, with all its horrors, in time of peace. Witn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s the epidemic at Georgetown in Maryland in 1793, at Derby in 1794 and at New-Haven in 1795. In an e&s;pecial manner, I ought to mention the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing dy&s;entery, between 1749 and 1753, a time of profound peace, when not a &s;oldier was &s;een in the country; a period when the di&s;ea&s;e was as mor|tal and as general, as between 1773 and 1777. A like epi|demic prevailed in many countries in Europe at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o taken pains to enquire of phy&s;icians in the country, as to the propagation of this di&s;ea&s;e from the army, and am in|formed that the di&s;ea&s;e was as fatal in villages where no inter|cour&s;e was had with the troops, as where there was intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>The acquie&s;cence of all de&s;criptions of men, learned and un|learned, in the opinion that epidemic di&s;ea&s;es are to be a&s;cribed &s;olely to infection or &s;pecific contagion, has proved extremely injurious to philo&s;ophy and to medicin.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A man in my father's neighborhood, was drafted to perform a tour of military duty at New-York, during the revolution-war. He was &s;o much terrified by the apprehen&s;ion of <HI>catching</HI> the dy&s;entery in the army, that he hired another man as a &s;ub&s;titute. The latter went to New-York, performed the duty and returned in health. The draft|ed man remained at home, was &s;eized with the di&s;temper in a few weeks after, and died.</NOTE> The di&s;ea&s;e is infec|tious, but it originates in any place, in particular &s;ea&s;ons, whether in peace or war; and ends at the command of the elements and &s;ea&s;ons. It cea&s;ed at the clo&s;e of 1777 in the army as well as country, and without any effort which had not been made in pre|ceding years. It may be ob&s;erved further that the dy&s;entery was and always is, mo&s;t prevalent among old people and chil|dren who have lea&s;t intercour&s;e with the &s;ick, e&s;pecially in the country, where no artificial cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;t.</P>

The great di&s;charges from Ve&s;uvius and a volcano in the Arctic regions in 1779, the terrible earthquakes, &s;evere cold and erup|tions of fire that followed, may perhaps lead us to a rational &s;o|lution of the phenomenon of the <HI>dark day</HI>&mdash;which has not hith|erto been explained.</P>

<P>In the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, but I do not recollect the preci&s;e time, appeared the mo&s;t &s;ingular halo about the &s;un which I ever beheld. I wrote a particular de&s;cription of it, at the time, which is mi&s;laid, and therefore I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe it

<P>On the 2d of October the leeward We&s;t-India i&s;lands expe|rienced a mo&s;t dreadful hurricane; and on the 11th the wind|ward i&s;lands were almo&s;t laid wa&s;te by a &s;imilar calamity. Bar|badoes which is lea&s;t &s;ubject to the&s;e tempe&s;ts, was laid de&s;olate; and it was e&s;timated that 6000 &s;ouls peri&s;hed. Hou&s;es, planta|tion-buildings, wharves, piers, &s;hipping were all overwhelmed in one general ruin. It is &s;aid that, during the tempe&s;t, &s;ome of the i&s;lands experienced an earthquake. Courant, Dec. 12, 1780. Jan. 9, 1781 and Jan. 23, 1781. As hurricanes are occa|&s;ioned by di&s;charges of electricity, &s;ome trembling of the earth almo&s;t always attends tho&s;e which are violent, and fla&s;hes of fire are vi&s;ible. Indeed the atmo&s;phere appears to be a &s;heet of fire. Similar di&s;charges of electricity attended the tempe&s;tuous earth|quake that de&s;troyed Nicomedia in 358&mdash;that which defeated Julian's attempt to rebuild Jeru&s;alem in 362&mdash;the hail-&s;torm in Egypt, in the time of Mo&s;es&mdash;and that which happened at Man|tua in 1785, to be hereafter related.</P>
<P>The canker-worm made exten&s;ive ravages in this period; but I cannot &s;tate their ri&s;e and decline in different parts of the coun|try. The winter of 1780-81 exhibited nothing worthy of par|ticular notice.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of 1781 prevailed the influenza, or epidemic catarrh. It began with a &s;evere pain in the head, pro&s;tration of &s;trength, coldne&s;s and chills, the pul&s;e not quick nor ten&s;e. The pain in the head la&s;ted about twenty-four hours, and was &s;ucceeded by a pain in the &s;ide, not pointed nor acute, extend|ing to the hips, accompanied with a &s;orene&s;s, and re&s;embling a rheumatic pain. The cough was trouble&s;ome, full, and the mat|ter di&s;charged of the glandular kind, not well concocted. Re&s;|piration was difficult, and a con&s;iderable defluxion on the lungs. In a few ca&s;es, the di&s;order terminated in 7 or 8 days; but u&s;u|ally not till the 13th or 14th; altho the patient was &s;eldom con|fined to his bed. The di&s;ea&s;e left a &s;ore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s and weakne&s;s in the &s;ide, which continued after the &s;trength was recovered. Vene|&s;ection had little effect on the pain in the &s;ide. Epi&s;pa&s;trics ap|plied to the part gave relief. The di&s;order was &s;eldom fatal, but

<P>In the &s;ummer following no particular phenomena occurred; the elements were in their u&s;ual &s;tate, &s;o far as my information extends; and in general the country enjoyed good health. A malignant fever prevailed, in &s;ome degree, in New-York, but excited no great alarm.</P>
<P>One year after this influenza in America, the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e pervaded the ea&s;tern hemi&s;phere. Its progre&s;s was from Siberia and Tartary we&s;tward; and it reached Europe in April and May 1782: I have no account of its cour&s;e in America, but it &s;eems to be probable, that it took its direction from America we&s;tward, and pa&s;&s;ing the Pacific in high northern latitudes, invaded A&s;ia and Europe from the ea&s;t. This mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e, if the epidemic in Europe was a continuation of that in America. For an account of this epidemic, &s;ee the publications of that year.</P>
<P>In 1782 happened con&s;iderable earthquakes in Calabria, du|ring which the mercury in the barometer in Scotland &s;unk within the tenth of an inch of the bottom of the &s;cale, and the waters in many locks in the highlands were greatly agitated.</P>
<BIBL>Sinclair's Stati&s;tical account of Scotland, vol. 6. 622.</BIBL>
<P>In Britain the &s;ummer was univer&s;ally wet and cold, and crops failed, in con&s;equence of which a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing dearth afflicted Scot|land in the following year.</P>

This was but a prelude to more terrible calamities; for about &s;even o'clock P. M. a tremendous &s;hock laid in ruins the greate&s;t part of Me&s;&s;ina, Calabria and many towns and villages. From 30 to 40,000 per&s;ons peri&s;hed in the ruins. On &s;ub&s;equent days, many &s;hocks were felt, but of le&s;s violence.

<P>The &s;ummer of 1783 was variable in the northern parts of America; in England, it was hot.</P>
<P>In June commenced a mo&s;t formidable di&s;charge of lava from Mount Heckla in Iceland, which continued till the middle of

Augu&s;t. The country around the mountain was covered with burning fluid, to the extent of 40 miles, and in &s;ome places, to the depth of 40 feet. The lava &s;pread over 3600 &s;quare miles.</P>
<P>Previous to this eruption, all the &s;prings and &s;treams of water in the neighborhood had been dried up; a &s;ure forerunner of the di&s;charge of fire; and for &s;ome months before the eruption, the atmo&s;phere over the i&s;land was filled with a dark, blui&s;h, &s;ul|phurous vapor or cloud, which was &s;tationary in calm weather, but which was &s;ometimes di&s;per&s;ed by winds, and &s;pread over Europe. See Encyclopedia, article Iceland. During this erup|tion, a new i&s;land was thrown up, at &s;ome di&s;tance from Iceland.

<BIBL>Encyclop. art. Iceland. Sinclair's Scot. vol. 6. 623.</BIBL>
<P>A part of the &s;ummer was exce&s;&s;ively hot in America. No le&s;s than thirty per&s;ons in Philadelphia, killed them&s;elves by drinking cold water. Many putrid fevers were the con&s;equence of the heat in various parts of the country; as al&s;o tornadoes and thunder gu&s;ts of unu&s;ual violence, with hail of uncommon &s;ize, in all parts of America.

<P>During the immen&s;e di&s;charges of fire and lava from Heckla, all parts of Europe, Great-Britain, Italy, Sicily, France and even the Alps were over&s;pread with a hazine&s;s in the atmo&s;phere. This cau&s;ed univer&s;al con&s;ternation, as a &s;imilar appearance had preceded the earthquake in Sicily on the 5th of February. The churches were crouded with &s;upplicants. The French a&s;trono|mer La Lande attempted to quiet the popular fears, by a&s;cribing the phenomenon to a &s;uperabundance of watery particles in the

earth, from the moi&s;ture of the preceding year, which were then exhaled by the &s;ummer heats. But this &s;olution is not &s;atisfact|ory. It was more probably the &s;moke from Heckla, wafted by northerly winds and di&s;per&s;ed over Europe, in an attenuated form.</P>

<P>It is &s;till more probable that this vapor was the effect of in|&s;en&s;ible di&s;charges of electricity, combined with aerial &s;ub&s;tan|ces; as in Sicily on the 5th and in America on the 10th of February.</P>
<P>In October occurred tremendous gales of wind and high tides which did no &s;mall damage in the &s;eaports of the United States. The fir&s;t, on the 15th and 16th, occa&s;ioned the highe&s;t water at New-Haven, which had been known in 40 years.

<P>In autumn 1783 &s;ome parts of Europe were deluged with continual rains, and at Rome 5 or 6000 children died of the &s;mall-pox. About Grenoble raged an epidemic fever.</P>
<P>A di&s;temper among the cattle in Derby in England, occa&s;ion|ed no &s;mall alarm, and a royal proclamation was i&s;&s;ued enjoin|ing certain precautions to prevent the propagation of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<P>In Egypt the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e committed mo&s;t terrible ravages in 1783-4 and 5. It began in November 1783. To this calami|ty was added a &s;evere famin; the inundation of the Nile, in the &s;ummer of that year, having proved in&s;ufficient. So &s;evere was the plague, that in the winter after 1783, fifteen hundred dead bodies were carried out of Cairo in a day; and the plague and famin of that and the &s;ucceeding year, was &s;uppo&s;ed to car|ry off one &s;ixth of the inhabitants of Egypt. See Volney's Travels, vol. 1. 192 and 3, and Courant, Oct. 28, 1783, and Oct. 17, 1785, in which it is &s;aid that in Cairo 3000 peri&s;hed in a day in April, 1785.</P>
<P>We have then an exact general view of the phenomena which introduce and accompany pe&s;tilence in Europe, Africa and A&s;ia &mdash;terrible earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes; exce&s;&s;ive drouth in America, India and Egypt, failure of crops and famin &mdash;meteors, great heat and deluges of rain, in other countries.

<P>During this period neither dy&s;entery nor pe&s;tilential autumnal fevers made any con&s;iderable ravages in America, as far as I can learn; except at Fell's-Point in Baltimore, where the bil|ious pe&s;tilential fever occa&s;ioned a mortality in 1783. Many &s;poradic ca&s;es of a &s;imilar fever appeared in various parts of the country, and almo&s;t a whole family in New-Jer&s;ey peri&s;hed by it in the autumn of that year. Fortunately however the con&s;ti|tution of the elements was corrected, without producing its mo&s;t fatal effects. Even the &s;carlet fever, with the exception of a few places, was le&s;s malignant than it has been in the la&s;t period.</P>
<P>This pe&s;tilential con&s;titution was felt al&s;o in the north of Eu|rope. The &s;carlatina broke out in Edinburgh in the winter of 1782-3, a few months before it did in America; but of its progre&s;s I have no account. It appears to have been epidemic in London in 1786; &s;o that its period was of about the &s;ame duration as in America. The cotemporaneou&s;ne&s;s of this &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e in Great-Britain and America, de&s;erves particular no|tice.</P>
<P>In December happened a fog in Am&s;terdam of &s;uch den&s;ity as to occa&s;ion complete ob&s;curity for three hours in the middle of the day. It was not po&s;&s;ible for per&s;ons to find their way in the &s;treets, and many pa&s;&s;engers and &s;ome carriages fell into the canals.</P>

<P>The &s;evere cold commenced early; the Delaware at Philadel|phia was clo&s;ed at the beginning of December, and continued bound with ice till the middle of March; notwith&s;tanding a re|laxation of cold and a heavy rain in January.

At the breaking up of winter, the thaw was &s;udden, and immen&s;e bodies of ice, floating down the rivers, which were greatly &s;welled, &s;pread ruin along the low lands on their banks.

<P>In 1783-4 the river Liffey in Ireland, the Thames in Eng|land, and all the rivers in the interior of Holland, were cover|ed with &s;olid ice. In Holland, the ice gave way about the fir&s;t of March, and the rivers being greatly &s;welled, the adjacent country was inundated, with immen&s;e lo&s;s of lives and property.

<P>This extreme heat, as u&s;ual, produced mo&s;t violent hurricanes or thunder gu&s;ts, with hail of unu&s;ual &s;ize. In May, pieces of ice fell in South-Carolina of nine inches in circumference. On the 17th of Augu&s;t the &s;outhern part of Connecticut was &s;wept by a tornado, which levelled trees and buildings and did great in|jury. The beginning of &s;ummer was very dry; but frequent powers afterwards refre&s;hed the earth, and good crops &s;ucceeded.</P>

<P>The wheat-in&s;ect, which has been ignorantly and improperly named the He&s;&s;ian Fly, committed uncommon ravages in this year. The preci&s;e time when this in&s;ect originated, is not a&s;cer|tained, probably about the year 1776, or a year or two earlier. Little notice was taken of it, for two or three years. In 1780, Mr. Underhill of Long I&s;land lo&s;t his wheat crops by the in|&s;ect; and in &s;ub&s;equent years, it penetrated into New-Jer&s;ey, travelling, according to common opinion, about 15 or 20 miles in a year. In 1785, it occa&s;ioned unu&s;ual de&s;truction of wheat &mdash;and &s;uch was the alarm in England, for fear it &s;hould prove <HI>infectious,</HI> and be introduced into that country, that the King i&s;|&s;ued a proclamation dated June 25, 1788, prohibiting the im|portation of American wheat.&mdash;This event excited no &s;mall un|ea&s;ine&s;s in America, e&s;pecially in the &s;tates, who&s;e &s;taple is wheat. Whereupon the Supreme Executive Council of Penn&s;ylvania re|que&s;ted the opinion of the Agricultural Society, as to the man|ner by which that in&s;ect is propagated. To this reque&s;t, the So|ciety returned for an&s;wer, their decided opinion that it is the plant alone which is injured by the in&s;ect; that the grain is &s;ound and good, and that the in&s;ect is not propagated by &s;owing wheat which grew on fields infected with it.</P>
<BIBL>See Mu&s;eum, vol. 4. 244. Am. Magazine.</BIBL>
<P>The prohibition by the King and Council of Great-Britain was deemed a judicious precaution; but was the fruit of an error that pervades the world, re&s;pecting the powers of <HI>infection</HI> and <HI>contagion.</HI> The opinion of the Agricultural Society is well foun|ded, but it remains for time and the force of truth to convince the people of Philadelphia, that the yellow fever can no more be tran&s;planted and rendered epidemic by infection, than the wheat-in&s;ect.

<P>THE winter of 1787-8 was colder than u&s;ual in America, but not of great &s;everity.</P>
<P>In Europe prevailed epidemic catarrh in 1788. It appeared at Vienna in April&mdash;was in Poland and Ru&s;&s;ia in May&mdash;at Lon|don in June&mdash;and at Paris in Augu&s;t. In St. Luke's Ho&s;pital, it began on the 16th of July, and a few ca&s;es occurred till Nov. 10th; but only twenty-five per&s;ons out of 190 were affected; a proof that it has little contagion. Gent. Mag. 1789. 346. The inva&s;ion of this epidemic was le&s;s &s;udden than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>On the 22d of July was a violent tempe&s;t from the N. E. which occa&s;ioned a very high tide in the Che&s;apeek, and no &s;mall damage. This is a &s;ingular occurrence. A north-ea&s;t gale in June or July on the American coa&s;t, mu&s;t be attributed to &s;ome extraordinary cau&s;e; and perhaps this may be a&s;cribed to the approach of a comet, which appeared in October and No|vember following. This comet was predicted by Mr. Her&s;chel, who made previous preparations for examining it.</P>

<P>The &s;ummer was remarkably tempe&s;tuous. On the 29th of Augu&s;t, a &s;evere gale of wind did great damage in many of our ports. Of 30 &s;ail of ve&s;&s;els, in certain rivers and bays of North-Carolina, 26 were de&s;troyed. A tempe&s;t in the begin|ning of the month had been terribly de&s;tructive. No one event is more certain, than a va&s;t increa&s;e of tempe&s;tuous weather du|ring the approach of comets.

and Philadelphia. Dr. Ru&s;h informs me, that it was brought to Philadelphia by the members of Congre&s;s, who returned from New-York, about the fir&s;t of October. Another account, writ|ten by one of the faculty in Philadelphia, and publi&s;hed in the 7th volume of the Mu&s;eum, mentions its fir&s;t appearance there, about the time of the Friends Yearly Meeting, in September. The preci&s;e time is probably not a&s;certainable; the opinion of its propagation by infection is very fallacious, as I know by repeat|ed ob&s;ervations. It probably appeared in detached ca&s;es, &s;ome days before it became a &s;ubject of ob&s;ervation.</P>
<BIBL>Mu&s;eum, vol. 7. 231.</BIBL>
<P>From the middle &s;tates, it moved rapidly over the whole coun|try. It appeared in Hartford, where I then re&s;ided, about the middle of October. On the 19th of that month, I left Hart|ford for Bo&s;ton and arrived the next day in good health. I was &s;eized with the influenza on the 23d, and by the aid of a dilu|ting regimen, recovered in four days. No per&s;on who attended me was &s;eized with the di&s;temper, &s;ooner than the other inhabi|tants of that town. I mention this to di&s;prove the common opin|ion of its infection; not that I deny it to be in a degree, infec|tious; altho my own ob&s;ervations do not warrant that conce&s;|&s;ion; but I aver that its propagation depends almo&s;t entirely on the in&s;en&s;ible qualities of the atmo&s;phere. Two ladies who left Bo&s;ton with me on the &s;econd of November, before the di&s;ea&s;e had appeared in their family, and before it was a &s;ubject of con|ver&s;ation, were &s;eized with it in Hartford, at the &s;ame time, that it became epidemic in Bo&s;ton, one on the 8th and the other on the 12th.&mdash;The di&s;ea&s;e had then pa&s;&s;ed Hartford, and there is no evidence of their being expo&s;ed to any per&s;on infected. This fact &s;hows a regular progre&s;s in the &s;tate of air producing the di&s;|ea&s;e &mdash;as per&s;ons leaving Bo&s;ton and travelling one hundred and twenty miles di&s;tance, were effected preci&s;ely at the time the di&s;ea&s;e became epidemic in that town.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e pervaded the wilderne&s;s and &s;eized the Indians&mdash; it &s;pread over the ocean and attacked &s;eamen a hundred leagues from land, and as to infection, entirely in&s;ulated&mdash;it appeared in the West-Indies nearly at the time it did in the northern

&s;tates. It over&s;pread America, from the 15th to the 45th de|gree of latitude in about 6 or 8 weeks; and how much further it extended, I am not informed.</P>
<P>It &s;hould have been mentioned that, in September, anterior to the inva&s;ion of the catarrh, the &s;carlatina angino&s;a appeared in Philadelphia; but in October it yielded to the influenza, the controlling epidemic. The &s;carlet fever re-appeared in Decem|ber, and became epidemic; often blending it&s;elf with the influ|enza. It exhibited one predominant feature of the whole &s;eries of &s;ucceeding epidemics, a prevalence of bilious matter, which was often di&s;charged by purging and vomiting. This di&s;ea&s;e con|tinued to prevail in Philadelphia, and if my information is cor|rect, in &s;ome parts of New-Jer&s;ey, till the &s;pring of 1790. The mea&s;les occurred in &s;ome ca&s;es, but was not epidemic.</P>
<BIBL>Mu&s;eum, vol. 7. 120, 175.</BIBL>
<P>It is remarkable that the &s;carlatina angino&s;a was cotemporary in Edinburgh with the epidemic mea&s;les in America in 1789, and nearly &s;o, with the death of the haddock on the coa&s;t of Norway.</P>
<P>It will be ob&s;erved that the &s;carlet fever, tho epidemic in Philadelphia, did not &s;pread over the country in 1790. It was little known in the northern &s;tates, till two years after&mdash;this is among the proofs that this di&s;ea&s;e does not depend on infection for its propagation. If infection was its only or principal means of propagation, the fomites exi&s;ted in great abundance, in par|ticular places in 1790, and &s;ufficient to have &s;pread it over the United States. But a di&s;ea&s;e however infectious, will not &s;pread far in an atmo&s;phere that will not generate it. Indeed &s;carcely a year pa&s;&s;es in which &s;poradic ca&s;es of &s;carlatina, or anginas of other kinds do not appear in particular places; but they never &s;pread without &s;ome uncommon concurrence of cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The winter of 1789-90 was one of the milde&s;t that is ever known in this country; there being little fro&s;t, except for a few days in February. There fell frequent &s;nows and in great abun|dance; but they were immediately followed by warm &s;outherly winds, and di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>Early in the &s;pring of 1790 we had a &s;econd epidemic ca|tarrh. I was attentive to its origin and progre&s;s. I found it at

Albany in the la&s;t week in March, and heard of it in Vermont about the &s;ame time. I returned to Hartford, but altho expo&s;ed repeatedly to its infection on my journey, I was not &s;eized earlier than others in Hartford, where the di&s;ea&s;e appeared about the middle of April. It &s;pread to the &s;outhward, arrived at Phi|ladelphia near the clo&s;e of that month, and di&s;appeared in that city about the middle of June. In the northern &s;tates, as far as my knowledge extends, the di&s;ea&s;e was more violent, than in the preceding autumn. Many plethoric per&s;ons of firm habit almo&s;t &s;unk under it; while con&s;umptive people and hard drink|ers fell its victims.</P>

<P>The &s;pring and &s;ummer of 1790 were mo&s;tly rainy; but oth|erwi&s;e &s;ea&s;onable weather.

<P>On the 15th of January, a con&s;iderable &s;hock of earthquake was experienced at Richmond in Virginia. At the &s;ame time catarrhs were &s;o prevalent in that &s;tate and in Penn&s;ylvania, as to excite an apprehen&s;ion of another vi&s;it of the influenza.

<P>To the&s;e phenomena &s;ucceeded in Connecticut the generation of millions of that &s;pecies of black worm, de&s;cribed under the year 1770. I believe they were far le&s;s numerous than in 1770; they however appeared in Hartford and in Norwich, and di&s;|appeared at the &s;ame time.

of the tropics, that a labored attempt was made to trace it to fomites from the coa&s;t of Africa. The truth is, the fever was nothing more than the common fever of the climate, with the &s;uper added malignancy derived from the exi&s;ting con&s;titution of the elements. The &s;ame fact took place on the African coa&s;t; that is, the u&s;ual fevers of the climate became more malignant.</P>
<P>This idea is &s;ugge&s;ted by a &s;eries of &s;imilar events in other cli|mates; all the di&s;ea&s;es of America, at the &s;ame time, a&s;&s;uming a &s;imilar augmented violence, and &s;poradic ca&s;es of malignant fever appearing in all parts of our country.

<P>To confirm this idea, let it be ob&s;erved that in the &s;ame year, when this malignant fever appeared in the African Seas on board of &s;hips, in Grenada, and in New-York, as well as in &s;poradic ca&s;es in other parts of America, the plague carried off two or three hundred thou&s;and people,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e numbers are to be &s;u&s;pected of exaggeration.</NOTE> in Egypt, and raged in Con&s;tan|tinople with great mortality.

In one in&s;tance, in Vermont, the hail-&s;tones which fell are &s;aid to have been from 3 to 6 inches in circumference.</P>
<P>About this time, a malignant fever began to rage in Charle&s;|ton, South-Carolina, carrying off the patient in three days, and occa&s;ioning a con&s;iderable mortality.</P>
<BIBL>Courant, Augu&s;t 6, 1792.</BIBL>
<P>In the following winter, Egypt was a prey to famin; and the &s;treets of Cairo were filled with dead bodies.</P>
<P>In November 1792 &s;everal &s;mart &s;hocks of earthquake were felt in Perth&s;hire, a county in Scotland.</P>
<P>In Philadelphia appeared an in&s;ect in the form of a fly, which generated a &s;mall worm or caterpillar, that attacked the tree, called Lime Tree, which is there u&s;ed for &s;hade. From that year to the year 1798, this in&s;ect has ravaged tho&s;e trees, and de&s;troyed &s;ome of them. Ju&s;t philo&s;ophy will not he&s;itate to believe the cau&s;e of this phenomenon and of the pe&s;tilence &s;uc|ceeding, to be connected.</P>
<P>In this year, 1792, commenced that &s;carlatina angino&s;a which became epidemic, with great mortality. I regret that a want of exact regi&s;ters, will not permit me to trace it to its &s;ources with the preci&s;ion de&s;ireable in all &s;uch ca&s;es. I am informed that well defined ca&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e were ob&s;erved in New-York, as early as the month of Augu&s;t. But it occa&s;ioned no con&s;idera|ble mortality in that city, until the following winter.</P>
<P>At Bethlem, in the we&s;tern part of Connecticut, there were five deaths in this year by the cynanche trachealis. I have not heard of any other in&s;tance. In Augu&s;t, there were &s;even or eight ca&s;es of the &s;carlatina angino&s;a, but &s;o mild as <HI>not to prove mortal.</HI> The reader will note the la&s;t circum&s;tance; for I am

able to prove, that this di&s;ea&s;e in Connecticut, was progre&s;&s;ive in a remarkable manner, and from the fact, which I believe is not uncommon, will be drawn mo&s;t important con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The autumn was one of the milde&s;t ever known, November was &s;o warm that we &s;at with open windows, at Hartford, on the 19th of the month. This moderate weather was &s;ucceeded by &s;evere cold, and Connecticut river was clo&s;ed by ice on the 10th of December. The latter part of winter however was not very &s;evere, except a week or two in February.</P>
<P>On the 11th of January 1793 appeared a comet in the con|&s;tellation of Cepheus. It was &s;een for the la&s;t time by Mr. Rit|tenhou&s;e on the 8th of February.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this winter and the &s;pring &s;ucceeding, the &s;carlet fever raged in New-York, with con&s;iderable mortality. It became epidemic al&s;o in Philadelphia, in the cour&s;e of the &s;pring months.</P>
<P>Catarrh was very prevalent in the northern &s;tates, at the &s;ame time; and the &s;mall-pox by inoculation at Hartford proved un|u&s;ually ob&s;tinate and fatal; indicating an in&s;alubrious &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>In February 1793 the &s;carlet fever invaded the town of Beth|lem, like "an armed man," &s;ays Mr. Backus, Medical Repo&s;i|tory, vol. 1. 524. He calls the di&s;ea&s;e angina maligna, and it doubtle&s;s put on the &s;ymptoms of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in many places. It &s;eized almo&s;t every family and child. It abated in May, di&s;appeared in November, and re-appeared in January 1794 with nearly its former violence. Nineteen children died in the fir&s;t inva&s;ion, and fourteen, in the &s;econd.</P>
<P>We have here di&s;tinct marks of progre&s;&s;ion. The di&s;ea&s;e in a mild form appeared in Augu&s;t 1792, then di&s;appeared. In February following, it invaded the town in its wor&s;t form. Six months therefore intervened between its precur&s;or, or mild form, and its inva&s;ion with full force.</P>
<P>The &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e appeared in the neighboring di&s;trict of coun|try and in di&s;tant parts, in nearly the &s;ame longitude, in the cour&s;e of this year; but I have not materials for a detail of facts.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="036687_0302_100AA2EBF4BE4DD8">I find however, it prevailed in Litchfield in 1793, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be imported into that town from Vermont. It was al&s;o very mortal in New-Fairfield, the &s;ame year. I therefor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pre&s;ume the di&s;ea&s;e to have been very general through the we&s;tern di&s;tricts of Connecticut, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Vermont, and to have prevailed as far we&s;tward as Penn&s;ylvania, in this year. Of its progre&s;s beyond that &s;tate, I have no information.</P>
<P>In September and October of this year, about the time the di&s;temper &s;ub&s;ided in Bethlem, it began to exhibit appearances of approach, in the maritime towns of Connecticut. Its precur|&s;ors at New-Haven, as de&s;cribed by Dr. Mon&s;on, a good judge of the &s;ubject, were "&s;light influenza, &s;linging pains in the jaws and limbs, &s;orene&s;s in the mu&s;cles of the neck, with a &s;light fever."</P>
<P>In November and December following, &s;everal ca&s;es of ulce|rous &s;ore throat occurred, but they had a favorable i&s;&s;ue, and the &s;ymptoms were not alarming.</P>
<P>In January 1794 arrived the cri&s;is of this di&s;ea&s;e; it put on its malignant &s;ymptoms, and in the cour&s;e of the &s;ix following months, &s;eized more than &s;even hundred per&s;ons, principally youth, of whom died fifty two.</P>
<BIBL>See Dr. Mon&s;on's account in my Collection, p. 173.</BIBL>
<P>Here again is di&s;tinctly marked a regular progre&s;&s;ion of &s;ymp|toms from September to January; the precur&s;ors being four or five months in advance of the di&s;ea&s;e in its mo&s;t violent form.</P>
<P>In Hartford, on Connecticut river, about thirty miles ea&s;t of Litchfield and Bethlem, I had an opportunity to make per|&s;onal ob&s;ervations on the origin and progre&s;s of this epidemic.</P>
<P>I do not know the date of the fir&s;t ca&s;e: but in my own mem|oranda, its appearance in my elde&s;t daughter, then in the 3d year of her age, is noted under the 12th of May 1793. The attending phy&s;ician informed me, that the di&s;ea&s;e was then epi|demic. Its fir&s;t appearance therefore mu&s;t have been a week or two earlier.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e was a mild &s;carlatina angino&s;a. The patient had con&s;iderable fever&mdash;the parosi&s;ms were daily, and terminated in pro&s;u&s;e &s;weats&mdash;there was a partial efflore&s;cence of the &s;kin about the neck and brea&s;t, and &s;ome affection of the throat. Its cri&s;is,
<PB N="299" REF="036687_0303_100AA325F7FFD890">
if I do not mi&s;remember, was about the eighth day. I was inform|ed that in no ca&s;e, did this di&s;ea&s;e prove mortal, during this in|va&s;ion.</P>
<P>The reader will ob&s;erve the dates&mdash;this mild angina invaded Hartford in April and May, about the time, the &s;everity of the di&s;ea&s;e began to abate in Bethlem.</P>
<P>Nine months after the inva&s;ion of this mild angina, that is, in February 1794, this di&s;ea&s;e appeared in Hartford in its formida|ble array, and many children became its victims.</P>
<P>Nothing can prove more clearly that infection had no concern in the origin of this di&s;temper, than this gradual augmentation of its &s;ymptoms. If any fact were nece&s;&s;ary to demon&s;trate the all-controlling influence of the elements, in the propagation and ter|mination of the di&s;ea&s;e, this <HI>progre&s;&s;ion</HI> alone would be &s;ufficient. The mild epidemic of May 1793, was the &s;ame &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e with that which was then de&s;troying life, in the we&s;tern parts of the &s;tate, and in New-York and Penn&s;ylvania; but the condition of the atmo&s;phere at Hartford was not, at that time, fitted to give the di&s;ea&s;e its full degree of violence. The &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on perhaps &s;u&s;pended the operation of the general cau&s;e, by means to us unknown. In February following arrived the cri&s;is of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I know not whether other epidemic anginas have been charac|terized by the &s;ame progre&s;&s;ivene&s;s in the &s;ymptoms. It is not improbable that they have; and that age after age has pa&s;&s;ed away, without noticing the circum&s;tance; a circum&s;tance that throws more light on the origin, cau&s;es and philo&s;ophy of epi|demics, than all the di&s;&s;ertations on the &s;ubject, &s;ince the days of Hippocrates.</P>
<P>My own children were affected with the mild angina in May. I removed, with my family, to New-York in November 1793, <HI>before</HI> the fatal angina invaded Hartford, and <HI>after</HI> it had fini&s;hed its cour&s;e in New-York; my children e&s;caped its violence, and probably in con&s;equence of this removal. This was an acciden|tal circum&s;tance in my family, but I &s;u&s;pect a &s;imilar removal of children, during the progre&s;s of that malady, might &s;ave a mul|titude of lives; altho the circum&s;tances of many people will not
<PB N="300" REF="036687_0304_100AA2EE2AE775A0">
permit them to avail them&s;elves of the expedient; and in &s;ome ca&s;es probably it would fail of &s;ucce&s;s. It however de&s;erves con|&s;ideration. The angina had completed its cour&s;e in New-York in 1793 or nearly. It did not invade Bo&s;ton till 1795. A re|moval of the children from the atmo&s;phere of Bo&s;ton in 1795, to an atmo&s;phere where the di&s;ea&s;e had cea&s;ed, would probably have &s;ecured mo&s;t of them from an attack.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer of 1793 was exce&s;&s;ively hot, after a dry &s;pring, and produced a great number of violent gu&s;ts, with rain and hail. The autumn was very dry. A fatal dy&s;entery prevailed in Georgetown, on the Potomak, and in the vicinity, which &s;wept away many hundreds of the inhabitants. The &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e prevailed in Coventry, in Connecticut, and killed almo&s;t every per&s;on whom it &s;eized. A nervous or long fever prevailed in Wethersfield. In &s;hort, in mo&s;t parts of the United States, the pe&s;tilential principle exhibited its effects, in &s;ome form or other, and every where &s;welled the bills of mortality. It extended to the We&s;t Indies, and &s;o violent was the epidemic at Grenada, that the phy&s;icians and inhabitants, unable to account for it, re|ally &s;uppo&s;ed it an imported di&s;ea&s;e. The treati&s;e written by Dr. Chi&s;holm to prove it imported, is &s;atisfactory evidence to me that the di&s;ea&s;e was an epidemic. The di&s;ea&s;e corre&s;ponds in its prin|cipal character, with the pe&s;tilential fevers of this country, many of which are known to be generated in our own climate.</P>
<P>In Augu&s;t 1793 commenced in Philadelphia that dreadful pe&s;tilence which alarmed the United States, and &s;pread terror and di&s;may over that city. The &s;pring di&s;ea&s;es, which u&s;hered in this malady, were influenza, &s;carlatina and mild bilious re|mittents. See Ru&s;h's Treati&s;e on that fever. The&s;e are the mo&s;t certain and immediate precur&s;ors of pe&s;tilence, in this country; and the influenza &s;eems to be &s;o, in all countries.</P>
<P>During this epidemic, the weather was very &s;ultry and dry. A|bout the 12th of September, fell a meteor between the city and the ho&s;pital. The number of victims to this di&s;ea&s;e was 4040.</P>
<P>A controver&s;y aro&s;e among the phy&s;icians in Philadelphia, relative to the origin of the plague, one party tracing the di&s;|ea&s;e, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, to infected ve&s;&s;els from the We&s;t-Indies;
<PB N="301" REF="036687_0305_100AA3281AAB4D10">
the other a&s;cribing it to exhalations from damaged coffee and filthy &s;treets. This controver&s;y has occa&s;ioned an unhappy &s;chi&s;m among the medical gentlemen, and the citizens of Phi|ladelphia.</P>
<P>It is greatly to be regretted that gentlemen of the faculty committed them&s;elves, by prematurely giving po&s;itive opinions on that important que&s;tion, and thus laying the foundation for permanent evils to the country. It would have been wi&s;er to have in&s;tituted a regular enquiry into hi&s;torical facts, relating to pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, antecedent to any po&s;itive deci&s;ions on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>By an account of the deaths in Algiers, kept by Capt. O'Brien, while a pri&s;oner, I perceive that 4893 per&s;ons died in 1793 by the mea&s;les and plague. There was a con&s;iderable increa&s;e of mortality in that year; and we ob&s;erve the mea&s;les and plague prevalent in the &s;ame year&mdash;an evidence that on the Barbary coa&s;t, as well as in Europe and America, the&s;e epidemics are allied.</P>
<P>By this account al&s;o it appears that in 1789 a number of per|&s;ons died by the <HI>a&s;thma.</HI> It is not probable this was epidemic, and I &s;u&s;pect by this name was intended catarrh or influenza. As this di&s;ea&s;e was then epidemic in the United States, it would be gratifying to know whether the &s;ame epidemic prevailed on the African coa&s;t, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that in the &s;pring of 1793, when the &s;carla|tina angino&s;a had fir&s;t commenced its progre&s;s in America, it began al&s;o in England. It appeared fir&s;t in the villages about London, and afterwards de&s;cended into the city. Med. Mem. vol. 4. It continued to prevail for &s;everal years, with different degrees of violence, at different times. See the Monthly Mag|azines.</P>
<P>The winter of 1793-4 was milder than u&s;ual in America. The thermometer in New-York, in a northern expo&s;ure, de&s;cen|ded no lower than 13 deg. above 0, and but twice to that degree.</P>
<P>On the 17th of May was a &s;ingularly &s;evere fro&s;t in the northern &s;tates of America, which de&s;troyed garden vegetables and the leaves of trees. The wheat, oats and flax in many places turned yellow, and fruit was de&s;troyed.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="036687_0306_100AA2EFB244E968">This fro&s;t was preceded by a few remarkable hot days, &s;uch as we u&s;ually have in June; and &s;peedily followed by a long &s;e|ries of rains, with ea&s;terly winds.</P>
<P>This fro&s;t has been &s;uppo&s;ed to kill the canker-worms, which had ravaged the orchards, for &s;ome years preceding. Another opinion is, that a hard fro&s;t in April, de&s;troyed them, ju&s;t after they were hatched. A third opinion is, that they had run thro their period of exi&s;tence, and peri&s;hed in a natural way. In confirmation of which opinion, it is &s;aid they were evidently declining in the preceding year. There is probably truth in both the latter opinions.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer of 1794 was, on the whole, not intemperate. We had hot weather, but frequently was the earth refre&s;hed by &s;howers, and cool we&s;terly winds. The whooping cough pre|vailed in New-York.</P>
<P>The &s;carlet fever, in the cour&s;e of this year, &s;pread over Con|necticut. Its effects are very apparent in the bills of mortality.</P>
<P>It appeared in 1795 in Bo&s;ton, in the &s;pring or early in &s;um|mer, and continued to prevail in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp|&s;hire in 1796. Its progre&s;s from New-York to Maine, about 300 miles or perhaps 400, was run in about four years. It trav|elled therefore about 100 miles in a year. Such al&s;o was the fact in the preceding period; as well as in 1735. It &s;hould be ob&s;erved al&s;o that its direction, in the two la&s;t epidemic periods, has been oppo&s;ite to that of the di&s;ea&s;e of 1735. The latter began in New-Hamp&s;hire and marched to the we&s;tward; the former began in the middle &s;tates, and advanced to the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>On the 10th of June 1794, the bilious plague made its ap|pearance in New-Haven, a &s;eaport in Connecticut. The per&s;on fir&s;t &s;eized with the di&s;ea&s;e was, the wife of I&s;aac Gorham, liv|ing on the wharf, and the nature of her complaint was not un|der&s;tood, nor &s;u&s;pected, till near the time of her death, on the 15th.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was it known that a pe&s;tilential fever was in the city, than the inhabitants took the alarm, and directed an exam|ination to be made into the cau&s;es. On enquiry, the following appeared to be the &s;ources of the di&s;ea&s;e, or were reported to be the probable cau&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="036687_0307_100AA32A8D3BAA30">In the beginning, of June, Capt. Truman arrived from Mar|tinico, in a &s;loop, which was hauled up by the &s;tore of Mr. Eli|jah Au&s;tin, a few rods from the hou&s;e of Mr. Gorham. This &s;loop was <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to be infected with the pe&s;tilential fever of the We&s;t-Indies. From this &s;loop was landed a che&s;t of clothes, which had belonged to a &s;eaman who died with the fever in Martinico; which che&s;t was opened and the contents inventoried by Mr. Au&s;tin, in his &s;tore, in pre&s;ence of Capt. Truman, of Henry Hubbard, a clerk in the &s;tore, and of Polly Gorham, a niece of I&s;aac Gorham. Mr. Au&s;tin and his clerk were &s;eized, a few days after the opening of this che&s;t, (but how many days is not &s;tated) and died about the 20th of June, Polly Gorham was &s;eized on the 12th and died on the 17th of June.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances appeared to the people at that time, to be clear and deci&s;ive evidence of the importation of the fomites of the di&s;ea&s;e; and e&s;pecially the fact, that Mr. Au&s;tin and his clerk were attacked with the &s;ymptoms, nearly at the &s;ame time. This acquie&s;cence in an opinion &s;o important to &s;ociety and truth, renders it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate the re&s;ult of more careful enquiries.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, the opinion that the &s;loop could communi|cate the infection, is unfounded; for it does not appear that any per&s;on, ill with yellow fever, had been on board&mdash;there cer|tainly had not been any &s;ick on board, after her leaving Martin|ico. The &s;loop was taken by the Briti&s;h troops, when they took that i&s;land, and lay in port &s;ome weeks, unoccupied; until Capt. Truman had an opportunity to purcha&s;e her. In the mean time, &s;ome of the crew, to keep them&s;elves employed and procure bread, went in the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>droging;</HI> that is, tran&s;|porting goods from place to place. One of them died with the fever, but on &s;hore, and he had not been on board of the &s;loop, after his illne&s;s. On the pa&s;&s;age home, the &s;eamen were all in good health. Then, is therefore not the lea&s;t ground to &s;uppo&s;e the &s;loop contained any infection, and no part of her cargo was &s;uppo&s;ed to be in a bad &s;tate. The external parts of a ve&s;&s;el or hou&s;e cannot retain or communicate infection.</P>
<P>Secondly. As to the che&s;t of clothes, it is probable it con|tained no infection from di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons; for by the affidavit of
<PB N="404" REF="036687_0308_100A89C2964A0248">
Capt. Truman, taken before Alderman Furman of New-York, at the reque&s;t of Dr. Baily, the Health Officer of that port, which affidavit I have con&s;ulted, it appears that the clothing, worn by the &s;eaman who owned the che&s;t and died at Martinico, was all wrapped in his blanket with his body and buried. As Capt. Truman is a man of good character and has made his affi|davit, four years &s;ince the di&s;ea&s;e at New-Haven, when all ap|prehen&s;ions of injury from declaring the truth, have &s;ub&s;ided, there &s;eems to be no rea&s;on to que&s;tion the fact.</P>
<P>But as men, who have not attended to the great operations of nature in producing epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, naturally look for the cau&s;es among vi&s;ible and tangible &s;ub&s;tances, they &s;till found a re&s;ource in a Briti&s;h regimental coat, which was in the che&s;t, and which, it was <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> might have belonged to a &s;oldier who <HI>might have died</HI> of the yellow fever. In con&s;equence of the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, the contents of the che&s;t were all burnt.</P>
<P>On examination it appears that the coat was new&mdash;and the mate of the &s;loop has &s;worn that he &s;aw the coat plundered by the &s;eaman from a bale of goods, and he believes it had never been worn. It was taken by the &s;eaman in the bu&s;ine&s;s of drog|ing, from among the packages of clothing &s;ent by the Briti&s;h government for the u&s;e of the troops. But had we no &s;uch evi|dence, common &s;en&s;e might inform us, that a man, <HI>laboring un|der a fever in the &s;ultry climate of the We&s;t-Indies,</HI> would not wear his regimental.</P>
<P>In the che&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, as in the &s;loop, we can find no infec|tion of yellow fever. If Mr. Au&s;tin and his clerk received the &s;eeds of di&s;ea&s;e from the clothing in the che&s;t, as it is po&s;&s;ible they did, the &s;ources of the di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t have been the fetid effluvia or dirty clothes, which had been kept a long time, clo&s;e packed in a che&s;t, in a &s;ultry climate. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;up|po&s;e the clothes to have been worn by a di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on. The &s;weat and filth from a body in health, if confined in the hot &s;ea|&s;on, will ferment and produce a poi&s;on injurious to health, and productive of yellow fever or other di&s;ea&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a well authenticated fact, that Mr. Daniel Phenix, trea&s;urer of the city of New-York, and his &s;ons were infected with a violent yellow fever, by means of the fetid effluvia from packages of bills of credit, which had been returned into the trea&s;ury, after being long u&s;ed, pa&s;&s;ing through dirty, &s;weaty hands, and then being clo&s;e pack|ed for &s;ome weeks, in a hot &s;ea&s;on.

<P>Mr. Au&s;tin went on bu&s;ine&s;s to New-York, was &s;eized with fever and died. His body was conveyed in a &s;loop to New-Haven, and buried. It is an agreed point, that no friend, nur&s;e or other per&s;on took the fever from him.</P>
<P>Mr. Hubbard went on bu&s;ine&s;s to Derby, ten miles di&s;tant, was taken ill and died. His body was carried to New-Haven, and buried. It is agreed that no per&s;on took the di&s;ea&s;e from him.</P>
<P>It is not known that Polly Gorham was ever near the trunk of clothing&mdash;the report of her being pre&s;ent re&s;ts on the &s;tory of a child. But if &s;he was, it makes no difference, for no per|&s;on who attended her was affected, except her mother, who had a &s;light fever. She lived and was ill, a mile from the wharf, and no per&s;on in that neighborhood was afterwards affected. In &s;hort, it is not pretended that the infection proceeded from either of the&s;e per&s;ons&mdash;the <HI>only per&s;ons</HI> who could po&s;&s;ibly have taken the di&s;ea&s;e from the trunk of clothing.</P>
<P>It is admitted on all hands that the infection mu&s;t have pro|ceeded from the hou&s;e of I&s;aac Gorham. Now it happens that Mrs. Gorham who was <HI>fir&s;t &s;eized and five days before Mr. Au&s;|tin and his clerk,</HI> had never been near the trunk of clothing, nor was an article of clothing from the &s;loop carried into the hou&s;e. For this a&s;&s;ertion, I have the authority of Mr. Gorham him&s;elf, who is admitted to be a man of veracity.</P>
<P>Had the origin and phenomena of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es ever been under&s;tood, the people of New-Haven would have fore&s;een, with
<PB N="306" REF="036687_0310_100AA2F25ED07938">
a good degree of certainty, that they could not e&s;cape pe&s;tilence. This will appear from the following facts.</P>
<P>In the winter and &s;pring of 1794, the &s;carlatina angino&s;a pre|vailed generally in New-Haven and the neighboring towns; manife&s;ting a highly pe&s;tilential condition of the elements. One ca&s;e of bilious fever, attended with a vomiting of black matter, occurred as early as the la&s;t week in March.</P>
<P>For many months preceding the inva&s;ion of the fever, the oy&s;|ters, on the coa&s;t of Connecticut, were in a very &s;ickly &s;tate. Many people can te&s;tify to the truth of this fact; but I have an account of it recorded at the time by the late Pre&s;ident Stiles. In a letter to his &s;on-in-law, the Rev. Mr. Holmes, of Cam|bridge in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, dated Sept. 25, 1794, be writes, that for twelve months pa&s;t he had eaten very few oy&s;ters, as they were di&s;ea&s;ed, poor and drop&s;ical. He remarked this of the oy&s;ters from New-York to Bo&s;ton. Tho&s;e caught on the &s;hores of Branford, Killingworth, and at Blue-Point on the &s;outh &s;ide of Long-I&s;land, were intolerable. At the date of the letter they were recovering and becoming more palatable. This is a &s;triking proof of the derangement of the elements.</P>
<P>Further evidence of this fact was furni&s;hed by the multitudes of caterpillars which overran the city of New-Haven, in the &s;um|mer of 1794.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some per&s;ons &s;ay, this was in 1773, but it is not material.</NOTE> In &s;uch numbers were the&s;e in&s;ects, that they almo&s;t covered the trees, fences, and hou&s;es to the tops of chimneys. The preceding hi&s;tory furni&s;hes many in&s;tances of this phenome|non, preceding and accompanying pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>Had the&s;e phenomena been under&s;tood, the people of New-Haven would have had no occa&s;ion to appoint a committee to ex|amin into the cau&s;es of the fever. It was hardly po&s;&s;ible, in the nature of things, that the human race &s;hould e&s;cape the calamity of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, under the operation of cau&s;e &s;o general and powerful.</P>
<P>But the&s;e were not all. Mr. Gorham, who&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ily fir&s;t &s;uf|fered by the fever, had, in the month preceding the inva&s;ion, cleaned a great number of &s;had, upon the wharf by his door,
<PB N="307" REF="036687_0311_100AA33066B2C4D0">
and thrown the garbage, to the amount of a car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> load perhaps, in|to the dock.</P>
<P>The alternate wa&s;hing of the tide, and action of a hot &s;un, had rendered the putrefaction of this ma&s;s of filth extremely ra|pid; and there being no current to remove it, the &s;tench be|came intolerable. On the other &s;ide of the wharf, a few rods di&s;tant, a boat load of clams had been depo&s;ited an the mud, that the water, during the &s;lux of the tide, might pre&s;erve them; but a great part of them were &s;oon &s;poiled, and added to the fetor of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>To complete the li&s;t of nui&s;ances, &s;ome barrels of damaged pickled cod-fi&s;h had been thrown from a &s;tore into the dock, and the whole was left vncovered during the rece&s;s of the tide. So noi&s;ome was the air of the place, for &s;ometime before the fever appeared, that the proprietor of the wharf de&s;i&s;ted from his u&s;ual morning vi&s;its before breakfa&s;t. For all the&s;e facts I have the declarations of the per&s;ons concerned and eye witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The putrefaction of fle&s;h, from thirty years ob&s;ervations, I can te&s;tify, will not always produce di&s;ea&s;e. But in a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air, the di&s;&s;olution of fle&s;h is unu&s;ually rapid, and the acid evolved, peculiarly noxious. In &s;uch circum&s;tances, putre&s;|cent &s;ub&s;tances of all kinds appear to be powerful auxiliary cau|&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e. The condition of the elements accelerates putre|faction, and that putrefaction in turn increa&s;es the deleterious quality of the air.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I may add to the&s;e cau&s;es of the fever, the water of the well u&s;ed by the people living on the wharf, which happened at that time to be covered over with dead rats in a &s;tate of putrefaction. This was di&s;|coverd by the offen&s;ivene&s;s of the water.</NOTE></P>
<P>Under the operation of &s;o many cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e, in&s;tead of being &s;urpri&s;ed at the appearance of a pe&s;tilential fever, we are rather to wonder that its ravages were not more exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>That the putrefaction of the fi&s;h was an exciting cau&s;e of the fever in New-Haven, is probable from the early appearance of it in &s;ummer. The fir&s;t ca&s;es occurred about the 10th of June, which is earlier than the epidemic pe&s;tilence of America u&s;ually occurs; and which indicates the exi&s;tence of &s;trong local cau&s;es. What further confirms this opinion, is, that after a few weeks
<PB N="308" REF="036687_0312_100AA2F68B5A5F40">
the di&s;temper was nearly or wholly extinct. In July died only three per&s;ons, and for about two weeks, no new ca&s;e occurred. But in Augu&s;t, the u&s;ual time of the appearance of this di&s;ea&s;e in this part of America, it broke out with fre&s;h violence. It is probable therefore that the <HI>morbid local</HI> cau&s;es induced the fever in one &s;mall &s;pot, before the proper &s;ea&s;on for it to prevail. The&s;e cau&s;es being gradually extingui&s;hed by the tides and a hot &s;un, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;ub&s;ided, until the u&s;ual &s;ea&s;on for &s;uch fevers. The &s;ame took place in New-York in 1795&mdash;in 1796&mdash;and 1798.</P>
<P>That the plague in New-Haven was the effect of a condition of the elements united with local cau&s;es, is proved by &s;ub&s;equent events. In the following year, a malignant dy&s;entery originated and prevailed in New-Haven, de&s;troying more lives than the bil|ious plague of 1794. This di&s;ea&s;e is acknowledged by able phy|&s;icians to be of the &s;ame &s;pecies as the yellow fever. See Lind on that point, and Ru&s;h's Works vol. 5. 5, where it is &s;tated, on the authority of Dr. Woodhou&s;e, that &s;everal per&s;ons took the yellow fever from &s;oldiers, laboring under the dy&s;entery. It is well known al&s;o that an epidemic yellow fever has been converted, by a &s;udden change of weather, into an epidemic dy&s;entery, and <HI>vice ver&s;a;</HI> as at Baltimore in 1797. It is al&s;o true that the yel|low fever in autumn pa&s;&s;es off in dy&s;entery, as in New-London in 1798. The &s;ame is at times true of the plague in A&s;ia.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e in 1795, as well as a &s;imilar dy&s;entery in Derby in 1794, demon&s;trated the deleterious condition of the elements in that region or vicinity.</P>
<P>If further evidence was nece&s;&s;ary, we have it in the bad &s;tate of the water in &s;ome of the wells in New-Haven, during the preva|lence of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, in which, one of the phy&s;icians of the city has informed me, were animalcules vi&s;ible to the naked eye. This fact corre&s;ponds with what occured in Athens, during the plague, where the badne&s;s of the water, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, led the people to a&s;cribe the di&s;ea&s;e to the poi&s;oning of the wells by the Lacede|monians. A &s;imilar fact probably led the Germans, in 1349, to &s;u&s;pect the Jews had poi&s;oned the wells, and on &s;u&s;picion alone to ma&s;&s;acre them without mercy. This &s;tate of the water, and the &s;ickne&s;s of the oy&s;ters alone decide the point, that the princi|pal &s;ources of the epidemics of 1794 and 5, were in the elements.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="036687_0313_100AA331EDD00ED0">It has been a&s;&s;erted that no per&s;on in New-Haven was affected by the fever, without intercour&s;e with the &s;ick or with infected clothing. On careful enquiry, I find this is not true. Several per&s;ons were affected who were not in the rooms, nor even in the hou&s;es of the &s;ick, and who could not be expo&s;ed, other|ways than by pa&s;&s;ing along the &s;treets. But &s;uch per&s;ons could not take the fever from the effluvia of the di&s;ea&s;ed. Men who &s;uppo&s;e this, are unacquainted with the powers of infection. Dr. Chi&s;holm &s;tates expre&s;sly that the infection of that di&s;ea&s;e in Grenada never exceeded <HI>ten feet;</HI> that it was ea&s;y to avoid it, and many who lived in the hou&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;ed, e&s;caped. Med. Repo&s;. vol. 2. 288. Dr. Lind, the able&s;t writer on the &s;ubject, who &s;pent his whole life in jails and ho&s;pitals, has ad|vanced the &s;ame doctrin. A great number of &s;ick in a narrow clo&s;e built &s;treet, may render the air of it infectious, but a few di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons in the wide &s;treets of New-Haven could not produce this effect. In general however the di&s;ea&s;e in this place was propagated by infection; the pollution of the atmo&s;|phere being confined to a &s;mall di&s;trict on and near the wharf, on low ground, to the leeward of the putrid &s;ub&s;tances before mentioned, and near the creek.</P>
<P>But there is one fact that will decide the que&s;tion relative to the origin of the pe&s;tilential fever in New-Haven, and every other place. It is &s;tated by the phy&s;icians that all other di&s;ea&s;es yielded to this fever. After it appeared in June, the &s;carlatina &s;ub&s;ided, and "in September, when the fever was mo&s;t preva|lent, the inhabitants in general were almo&s;t entirely free from every other complaint."</P>
<BIBL>See Dr. Mon&s;on's account of the fever, in my Collection, p. 178.</BIBL>
<P>Here we have an infallible criterion by which to determin whether a di&s;ea&s;e is an epidemic of the place, or introduced and propagated &s;olely by infection. A di&s;ea&s;e of mere infection can never extingui&s;h other di&s;ea&s;es of the place. The &s;mall-pox introduced by <HI>variolous matter,</HI> and communicated to every fam|ily would not ab&s;orb a dy&s;entery or &s;carlet fever prevailing in the &s;ame place; every ho&s;pital will demon&s;trate this principle. A di&s;ea&s;e of mere infection would not affect another di&s;ea&s;e even
<PB N="310" REF="036687_0314_100AA2F8145D6CB8">
in the next hou&s;e. Every di&s;ea&s;e that extingui&s;hes another di&s;|ea&s;e current in a town, is an epidemic originating in that place. It not only proves that the atmo&s;phere will produce that di&s;tem|per, but it proves that it will produce no other. On this princi|ple I will re&s;t the que&s;tion, as it regards not only the fever in New-Haven, but every pe&s;tilence that ever exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer of 1794 was, in mo&s;t places, le&s;s &s;ickly than in 1793 and 1795; yet the &s;carlatina extended its ravages over Connecticut, and Philadelphia and New-York experienced the predominant epidemic con&s;titution. In Philadelphia died from 70 to 100 per&s;ons of the bilious plague; in New-York twenty or thirty ca&s;es of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e indicated the &s;ame condition of the atmo&s;phere. It was the general opinion in New-York, that the city was remarkably healthy; but this opinion, &s;o flat|tering to the people, was a fallacy. The bills of mortality were higher than in healthy years, and this augmented mortality was a prelude to the epidemic of the &s;ucceeding year.</P>
<P>On the 15th of June was a great eruption of Ve&s;uvius, nearly equal to that of 1779. The lava ran down the mountain on the we&s;t and extended to the &s;ea, overwhelming the town of Tome del Greco.</P>
<BIBL>See Univer&s;al Mag. for Aug. 1795.</BIBL>
<P>In this year the bilious pe&s;tilence prevailed in Baltimore. No &s;ugge&s;tion has been made that it was imported, and the phy&s;i|cians and inhabitants &s;eem to admit the di&s;ea&s;e to have been on|ly a more malignant form of the ordinary autumnal remittent.</P>
<P>In the &s;ucceeding winter, the epidemic of the &s;ummer and autumn changed, in Philadelphia, into the form of catarrh or pleuri&s;y, and in many ca&s;es, was attended with delirium and mania. See Ru&s;h on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Pe&s;tilential epidemics, or rather the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere which produces them, u&s;ually affects the brain, in a mo&s;t &s;en&s;i|ble degree. This is obvious from the vertigo, &s;o frequent during &s;ickly periods; pains in the head, dizzine&s;s and nervous debility often complained of by &s;tudious men. In &s;ome periods, this affection of the brain has appeared in epidemic madne&s;s. See the years 1355; 1373 and 4.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="036687_0315_100AA333774EB100">A few ca&s;es of a di&s;order of this &s;pecies appeared in New-Haven and its vicinity in the winter after the pe&s;tilence. The patient was &s;eized with a violent pain in the head, between the Os frontis and the Coronal Sutures, which was periodical, com|mencing about 11 o'clock A. M. and increa&s;ing till 2 P. M. In &s;ome ca&s;es, the paroxi&s;m was accompanied with delirium; but the pain was limited to the head, and unattended with fever. Bleeding, purging and opium produced no alleviation; but a bli&s;ter on the forehead or temple, &s;oon relieved the patient, and effected a cure. This account is taken from Dr. Hotchki&s;s, the attending phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>The winter of 1794-5 was very cold in Europe, and in January 1795, the French troops marched into Am&s;terdam, over the rivers and canals, on the ice. This &s;everity was to be expected from the great eruption of Ve&s;uvius in the preceding &s;ummer.</P>
<P>The catarrh was epidemic in January and February, in the Briti&s;h channel fleet. In one &s;hip it a&s;&s;umed the &s;ymptoms of a pure typhus.</P>
<BIBL>Trotter's Med. Naut. p. 366.</BIBL>
<P>In America, the &s;ame winter was milder than u&s;ual. Per|&s;ons walked on the battery at New-York, for plea&s;ure, on Chri&s;tmas day, with no covering but their ordinary autumnal clothes; and ve&s;&s;els &s;ailed up the Hud&s;on and Connecticut till January. In the latter part of the winter, we had &s;ome cold weather, and a cool late &s;pring.</P>
<P>About the 20th of July, began a &s;eries of hot, damp, rainy weather, with light &s;outherly winds; a &s;ea&s;on an&s;wering to the de&s;cription which Hippocrates has given of a pe&s;tilential con&s;ti|tution. Heavy rains were followed by a humid, clo&s;e, &s;ultry air; no thunder and lightning; no north-we&s;terly winds to cool and refre&s;h the fainting bodies of men. For many weeks the atmo&s;phere was &s;o loaded with vapor, that no electricity could be excited with the be&s;t in&s;truments. Fruit peri&s;hed on the trees and fell half rotten and covered with mold. Sound potatoes from the market peri&s;hed in my cellar in thirty-&s;ix hours. Cab|bages rotted off, between the head and the &s;talk, as they &s;tood
<PB N="312" REF="036687_0316_100AA2F99CE0EDD8">
in gardens. The moi&s;ture penetrated into the inmo&s;t rece&s;|&s;es of de&s;ks and bureaus, covering books, papers and clothes with mold, under two locks. The walls of hou&s;es, and the paper of inner apartments became white with mold and required &s;craping. This &s;tate of the air produced al&s;o mu&s;ketoes without number; while flies di&s;appeared. It is ob&s;ervable that the&s;e two kinds of in&s;ects thrive in different conditions of the air&mdash; flies in a hot, dry air; mu&s;ketoes, in a hot, moi&s;t air.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary here to correct a mi&s;take of Dr. Currie on bil|ious fevers, page 12, where he mentions the years 1795 and 7 as "wetter and cooler than many preceding &s;ea&s;ons." The truth is, the latter part of the &s;ummer of 1795, was on an average three degrees by Farenheit, warmer than the weather had been in the ten preceding years. See a letter from Profe&s;&s;or Kemp in Dr. Bailey on yellow fever, p. 54. In the cour&s;e of my life, I never experienced a &s;tate of air &s;o debilitating and un|friendly to animal &s;pirits, as the month of Augu&s;t 1795. The effects of it are very vi&s;ible in the bill of mortality for that year in Philadelphia, which contains double the u&s;ual number of deaths.</P>
<P>In July of this year appeared the bilious plague in New-York. The fir&s;t ca&s;e that excited public attention was that of Dr. Treat, the Health Officer of the port, who fell a victim, on the 29th of the month. His di&s;ea&s;e has been a&s;cribed by &s;ome per&s;ons, to infection taken on board a ve&s;&s;el from the We&s;t-Indies, the brig Zepher in which a per&s;on died, whom Dr. Treat a&s;&s;i&s;ted in burying. But it is not probable, that this was a ju&s;t opinion; as many other per&s;ons vi&s;ited the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el, and the wardens of the port were on board, while a part of her cargo, &s;ome damaged coffee, was thrown into the &s;tream, without the lea&s;t inconvenience to their health. The plethoric habit of Dr. Treat, and his great fatigue in an open boat and in a burning &s;un, are &s;ufficient to account for his di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>But admitting him to have taken his di&s;ea&s;e from the fomes of a &s;ick or dead per&s;on, or from the foulne&s;s of the brig, the fact does not in the lea&s;t aid the advocates of infection, for no per|&s;on, nur&s;e, attendant or vi&s;itor, received the di&s;temper from him,
<PB N="313" REF="036687_0317_100AA3360E1F72B0">
nor did the di&s;ea&s;e prevail, in the &s;treet where he died, during the &s;ub&s;equent &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid that three or four &s;eamen, belonging to the &s;hip William, were &s;eized with the di&s;temper in con&s;equence of vi&s;it|ing the brig Zepher. But on enquiry, it was found, that the&s;e men only came along &s;ide of the brig and purcha&s;ed &s;ome fruit. To &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e men &s;hould all take a di&s;ea&s;e from the brig, when two or three wardens of the port, who were &s;ome hours on board, while a damaged cargo was di&s;charged, e&s;caped without the lea&s;t affection, is ridiculous.</P>
<P>But what cuts &s;hort all controver&s;y on this &s;ubject, is, that fourteen days at lea&s;t before the death of Dr. Treat, a man in the ho&s;pital died of a &s;imilar fever; and the late Dr. Pitt Smith, in|formed me in the autumn of 1795, that he vi&s;ited another patient a black&s;mith, with a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e, early in July. In fact then, the di&s;ea&s;e was in New-York before the arrival of the &s;uppo&s;ed infected ve&s;&s;els; and the ca&s;es which occurred early in July, were <HI>precur&s;ors</HI> of the epidemic which was to follow.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t al&s;o be ob&s;erved that the di&s;ea&s;e in New-York never &s;pread over the whole city. It ran along the low &s;treets on the Ea&s;t river, in what was formerly the &s;wamp and in the narrow alleys. The high grounds in the center of the city, and the we&s;|tern &s;ide of the i&s;land, were healthy as u&s;ual; and the di&s;ea&s;e, when carried from the infected &s;treets, upon the elevated parts of the city, exhibited no contagion, but di&s;appeared.&mdash;A &s;mall part only of the citizens fled; mo&s;t of them remained, and pur|&s;ued their occupations, in the greate&s;t part of the city, with per|fect &s;afety. The deaths were about &s;even hundred and thirty; among which at lea&s;t five hundred were foreigners, mo&s;t of whom had recently arrived from Scotland and Ireland.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Four hundred and &s;ixty two belonged to the Catholic Congrega|tion under the Rev. Mr. O'Brien, mo&s;t of whom had been &s;o &s;hort a time in the country, that he did not know them.</NOTE> The mortal|ity in New-York was mo&s;tly owing to this influx of foreigners, not &s;ea&s;oned to our climate.</P>
<P>This fever in New-York was preceded in &s;pring by epidemic mea&s;les, which di&s;appeared totally during the three months, when
<PB N="314" REF="036687_0318_100AA2FC1B6B1AA0">
the fever was the ruling di&s;ea&s;e, and re-appeared in November&mdash; a deci&s;ive evidence that the fever was produced and controlled by the &s;ame cau&s;e, as the mea&s;les.</P>
<P>In this year al&s;o appeared the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e at a landing, called Mill-river four miles from Fairfield, in Connecticut, and about &s;ixty miles from New-York&mdash;a &s;mall village, near the water. It was reported that this di&s;temper was propagated at Mill-river, by infected per&s;ons from New-York. I have taken pains to en|quire carefully of both the attending phy&s;icians and the clergy|men, who vi&s;ited the &s;ick, who all agree, that one man from New-York had died of the fever in the village, that &s;ummer, and he was dead, <HI>three weeks</HI> before, Mr. Tharp, the fir&s;t man &s;eiz|ed, was taken ill.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e affected others of his family, but &s;pread no fur|ther; and the gentlemen above-mentioned do not believe it to have been derived from imported infection.</P>
<P>The bilious remittent fever, is annually the di&s;ea&s;e of autumn in &s;ome parts of the &s;outhern &s;tates; and &s;trangers, vi&s;iting that country from the Delaware to Florida, in the hot &s;ea&s;on run the hazard of a fever. Drs. Taylor and Hansford, two old practitioners in Norfolk, Virginia, &s;peaking of the yellow fever of 1795, &s;ay, "The &s;ame fever, with all its malignant and uncontrollable &s;ymptoms, occurs every year, in &s;cattered in|&s;tances, and about the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on."</P>
<BIBL>See my Collection on Bilious Fevers, p. 151.</BIBL>
<P>But during pe&s;tilential periods, this di&s;ea&s;e in that unhealthy country, takes a wider &s;pread, and becomes infectious.</P>
<P>In 1795 this was the ca&s;e at Norfolk&mdash;a town that is &s;ituated on low flat land, a few feet only above high-water, and &s;ubject to autumnal fevers. The di&s;ea&s;e prevailed mo&s;t in the narrow &s;treets and poor &s;mall hou&s;es, and was mo&s;t fatal to &s;trangers.</P>
<P>Two remarkable facts occurred there and are related in the account la&s;t cited, to prove that the di&s;ea&s;e was occa&s;ioned &s;olely by a general &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere in and about the town, without a dependence on infection. The fir&s;t is, that traders who vi&s;ited the port, altho they were not known to have had in|tercour&s;e with the &s;ick, took the di&s;ea&s;e and died on their re|turn into the country. But a more remarkable fact is, that the
<PB N="315" REF="036687_0319_100AA3385E2B5F98">
&s;eamen of a &s;hip from Liverpool, which did not approach near|er than five miles di&s;tance from the town, and which had no communication with the &s;hore, except by means of the health-boat, were almo&s;t all attacked with the di&s;ea&s;e, in ten days after their arrival. This was late in the &s;ea&s;on, and when the di&s;ea&s;e had nearly di&s;appeared in town.</P>
<P>In the year 1794 &s;everal ca&s;es of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e had occur|red in Norfolk. In 1797 the di&s;ea&s;e was again frequent. In 1795 and 7, the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been augmented by the great rains and floods which had preceded, and which had brought down the river and &s;pread on the &s;hores, large quan|tities of vegetable &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>The extreme unhealthine&s;s of the &s;ummer of 1795, was man|ife&s;ted by unu&s;ual mortality in various other parts of the country. On the level plains of Duche&s;s county in New-York &s;tate, pre|vailed a mortal dy&s;entery and typhus fever. At Cox&s;akie on the we&s;t of the Hud&s;on, raged &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;es with fatal effects. In &s;ome we&s;tern parts of the &s;tate, near the mar&s;hes which border the waters of the country, a malignant bilious fever was more terribly fatal, than the fever in New-York.</P>
<P>In Sheffield, a we&s;tern town&s;hip of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, near two large ponds which form mar&s;hy grounds, bilious fevers, which had not been known there for many years, before, prevailed and in &s;ome ca&s;es were mortal.</P>
<BIBL>See Dr. Buel's account of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, in my Collection, p. 53.</BIBL>
<P>In that town, the progre&s;&s;ivene&s;s of the morbid principle of this pe&s;tilential period, was clearly di&s;coverable. Many ca&s;es of intermittents occurred in 1793; and a few in&s;tances of bil|ious remittents. This was during the plague in Philadelphia. In 1794, early in &s;pring, inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es of the pneumo|nic kind, were unu&s;ually frequent. The&s;e were &s;ucceeded by intermittents, which were more frequent than in the preceding year. In July, the bilious remittent appeared, and 80 inhabi|tants out of 150, who lived within a mile and a half of the &s;outh pond, were affected. In 1795, of 200 inhabitants within three fourths of a mile di&s;tant from the north pond, 150 were affected with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;but few died.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="036687_0320_100AA2FE5477A3A8">In 1796, the dy&s;entery, which had not appeared in many preceding years, began its attacks on children, and not long af|ter adults were taken either with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e or with the bil|ious remittent. Of one hundred families living within a mile and a half of one of the ponds, not ten e&s;caped &s;ickne&s;s&mdash;more than half of the inhabitants were, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on, attacked with one or other of the abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> mentioned di&s;ea&s;es.

<P>In the preceding period, great mortality prevailed among the gee&s;e in &s;ome parts of our country; and in the year 1796, a &s;imilar mortality among other fowls. I have not been able to ob|tain a particular de&s;cription of the &s;ymptoms, but it was ob&s;erved the tran&s;ition from apparent health to death, was very rapid.</P>
<P>In 1796 the mea&s;les which commenced in New-York in 1795 was epidemic in Connecticut; and unu&s;ually prevalent in London.</P>
<P>In 1796 al&s;o the bilious plague again appeared in New-York, but in a different quarter of the city from that which was princi|pally affected, the year preceding. In 1795, it began and was mo&s;t general in the north-ea&s;tern part&mdash;in 1796, in the &s;outh-we&s;tern part, near the battery; and in both &s;ummers, its &s;eat was along the wharves on the Ea&s;t river, and in the adjoining &s;treets and alleys. All this part of the city is a level, formed by extending the land and wharves into the Ea&s;t river. The land is of cour&s;e loo&s;e and porous, admitting, in many places, the wa|ter of the &s;ea into the cellars of the hou&s;es; &s;ome of which are penetrated, on every flux of the tide. The&s;e artificial &s;treets, Front and Water &s;treets, are not ea&s;ily wa&s;hed clean, on account of their level po&s;ition, and they receive the filth wa&s;hed from the higher grounds of the city. To the&s;e &s;treets, and &s;imilar ones in the &s;wamp on the north-ea&s;t, was the malignant di&s;temper principally limited.</P>
<P>In 1796 a new wharf below Exchange &s;lip, which had been timbered the preceding autumn, and left unfilled, had become a
<PB N="317" REF="036687_0321_100AA33B837C49C8">
re&s;ervoir for all kinds of putrid, filthy &s;ub&s;tances, and was &s;up|po&s;ed to be a powerful cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the quarter in which the di&s;ea&s;e raged this year, is al|mo&s;t wholly covered with old wooden hou&s;es, and many of them, built before the rai&s;ing and paving of the &s;treet, have their lower floors two or three feet below the &s;urface of the pavements. In this di&s;trict appeared the yellow fever in June; but a &s;eries of rainy weather and cool we&s;terly winds, &s;u&s;pended its action, in the beginning of July. Succeeding hot weather renewed it, and in the limits above de&s;cribed, extending about forty or fifty rods, about &s;eventy per&s;ons fell victims. The other parts of the city remained in the u&s;ual autumnal &s;tate of health, with only a few &s;cattering ca&s;es of the plague.</P>
<P>At Wilmington, North-Carolina, prevailed a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e. It was preceded by the dy&s;entery, in July, after a very wet &s;pring. When the bilious fever commenced in Augu&s;t, the dy&s;entery declined, and tho&s;e who had been affected with it e&s;|caped the fever. About one hundred and fifty deaths, by the&s;e two forms of di&s;ea&s;e, occurred in 130 families. Different opin|ions were entertained about the origin of the fever; but the phy|&s;ician who gives this account has no doubts of its dome&s;tic origin. He informs us further that a few ca&s;es, in that town, occur annu|ally, which a&s;&s;ume all the &s;ymptoms of a violent yellow fever.</P>

<P>In this year, the di&s;ea&s;e occa&s;ioned a con&s;iderable mortality in Charle&s;ton, South-Carolina, and in Newburyport, in Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts. It appeared in Bo&s;ton al&s;o, but was not general nor &s;evere.</P>
<P>In Charle&s;ton, it &s;ucceeded one of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive fires, ever known in that city; and was in part a&s;cribed to the &s;tagnant water which accumulated in the open cellars.</P>
<P>In Newburyport, there was no plau&s;ible pretext for a&s;cribing the di&s;ea&s;e to imported infection; and the general belief was, that the immediate exciting cau&s;e, was, the remains of large quanti|ties of fi&s;h which had been left to corrupt on the wharf, near which the di&s;temper originated, and which occa&s;ioned an intolerable &s;tench. But in that town, a previous increa&s;e of mortality indi|cated a &s;ickly &s;tate of the elements; as in all other places, where
<PB N="318" REF="036687_0322_100AA30199DBBC58">
the pe&s;tilence has made its appearance. In none of the northern &s;tates, which are u&s;ually healthy, has the bilious plague occurred without other di&s;ea&s;es for precur&s;ors.&mdash;The di&s;ea&s;e in Newbury|port was confined to a low &s;treet or two, and when carried upon the high grounds, it exhibited little or no infection, but di&s;ap|peared with the death or recovery of the patient.</P>
<BIBL>M. S. Letter from Nicholas Pike, E&s;q.</BIBL>
<P>In Bo&s;ton, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread only in a &s;mall part of the town, adjoining the water. The phy&s;icians were unanimou&s;ly of opin|ion, that it was not occa&s;ioned by any fomites from infected arti|cles imported, but generated in the town.</P>

<P>The pe&s;tilential &s;tate of the elements was &s;trongly marked, this year, by the poorne&s;s of the &s;had brought to market in New-York. The&s;e were all thin, lean and &s;mall; and for this rea&s;on, I pur|cha&s;ed none for my own u&s;e, during the &s;ea&s;on. Other per&s;ons ob&s;erved the fact; and I am &s;ince informed that &s;uch of tho&s;e fi&s;h as were pickled, peri&s;hed in defiance of all human care to pre|&s;erve them. The &s;ame &s;tate of the &s;had was ob&s;erved in Con|necticut.</P>
<P>Some ca&s;es of yellow fever occurred in Philadelphia in 1796; catarrh was frequent in the winter, followed by mea&s;les of a mo&s;t inflammatory nature. A remarkable halo appeared on the 25th of July.</P>
<BIBL>Ru&s;h, vol. 5. 9.</BIBL>
<P>It has been already ob&s;erved that the winter of 1795, was remarkably &s;evere in Europe. In America the &s;ame winter was as mild as u&s;ual. But in the &s;ummer and autumn of 1796, the northern &s;tates experienced a mo&s;t &s;evere drouth.</P>
<P>The following winter was very &s;evere; the cold exceeding what is u&s;ual, and being of long duration. The &s;ummer of 1797 was cool and wet. The winter of 1797-8 was &s;evere&mdash; and the cold of very long duration. It commenced early in No|vember and continued till March. The Hud&s;on and Connecti|cut were clo&s;ed in November; a very rare occurrence. For &s;everal weeks in November and December, the wind, without much &s;now on the earth along the Atlantic coa&s;t, was from the north-we&s;t and inten&s;ely dry and cold.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="036687_0323_100AA33DE08ECEF0">In Augu&s;t 1797 appeared a comet, which, according to cal|culations of a&s;tronomers, pa&s;&s;ed near the earth, altho it was of &s;mall apparent magnitude, and &s;een by few people.</P>
<P>The influence of this &s;pecies of bodies in occa&s;ioning great tides, and violent &s;torms, has been already mentioned, and of that influence, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, I was a witne&s;s. In 1797 my re&s;idence was, as it had been the preceding year, on a height of York I&s;land near Corlaer's Hook to the northward of which is a flat, which is never covered with water by a common tide, but is over&s;pread by &s;pring tides, or any unu&s;ual &s;well in con&s;equence of ea&s;terly winds. I ob&s;erved, as early as the la&s;t week in May, high tides were unu&s;ually frequent and the &s;well extraordinary. In the city of New-York, the &s;ame fact was ob&s;ervable; and the inhabitants about Beekman &s;lip will recol|lect how often the wharves and &s;treet were covered with water. The&s;e tides were not to be accounted for, on any known prin|ciples of lunar influence, and I frequently mentioned the phe|nomenon to my friends, but without &s;u&s;pecting the cau&s;e. The &s;ame phenomenon was noticed at other places. In Norfolk, the epidemic fever was, in part, a&s;cribed to unu&s;ual tides; as I was afterwards informed. On the Delaware, the overflowing of the low lands, below Philadelphia, was extraordinary, and &s;ome phy&s;icians a&s;cribe to this cau&s;e the yellow fever, which &s;wept away mo&s;t of a family by the name of Whitall.</P>
<P>I was lately mentioning the&s;e events to a re&s;pectable gentleman in Stamford,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Hon. John Davenport, now repre&s;entative in Congre&s;s.</NOTE> who in&s;tantly recollected a fact which confirms the foregoing account. He remarked that the common practice in that town, is to mow the &s;alt meadows, at the quadratures of the moon, on account of &s;mall tides; but in 1797, the calcula|tions failed, and the people were much troubled to collect their hay, on account of high tides&mdash;a circum&s;tance that was very &s;urpri&s;ing to him at the time, but he did not advert to the prob|able cau&s;e. This was in Augu&s;t; about the time that the comet was fir&s;t ob&s;erved. The fact then of the influence of comets, in rai&s;ing the waters of the ocean, is well e&s;tabli&s;hed; and the
<PB N="320" REF="036687_0324_100AA30402DAB680">
appearance of a comet in autumn explained the phenomena of the tides to my &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The influence of comets in augmenting tempe&s;ts is equally certain and remarkable.</P>
<P>On the 19th of Augu&s;t, a &s;torm and whirlwind in South Pru&s;&s;ia tore up fore&s;ts carried trees along like &s;heaves of wheat, and levelled &s;everal villages.</P>
<P>In Rome and Naples happened a mo&s;t extraordinary tempe&s;t on the 25th of September, &s;uch as the olde&s;t man could not re|collect. It took up men and carried them &s;ome di&s;tance. The a&s;tronomers were con&s;ulted and they a&s;cribed it to the approxi|mation of the comet.</P>
<P>A &s;torm of hail in the province of Macconnois, in France, and on the borders of Burgundy, de&s;troyed the vines and fruits of the earth in thirty-four villages. In the appropriations made afterwards by the councils of France, four millions were granted to repair the lo&s;&s;es by hail, inundations and other di&s;a&s;ters.</P>
<P>On the 7th of September, a con&s;iderable &s;hock of earthquake was felt in the We&s;tern Pyrenees. On the 28th of the month was a volcanic eruption in Guadaloupe; and many earthquakes occurred during the autumn.</P>
<P>In England, the &s;ummer was &s;o rainy and wet, as to injure the corn and threaten the inhabitants with &s;carcity. It would require pages to relate all the accidents by floods in Great-Brit|ain from Augu&s;t to the clo&s;e of the year.</P>
<P>During the autumnal months, the Black &s;ea al&s;o was unu&s;u|ally tempe&s;tuous, and the lo&s;s of &s;hipping alarmed Con&s;tantino|ple, with apprehen&s;ions of a &s;carcity of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>In February, 1797, South-America was terribly convul&s;ed. Quito and the neighboring provinces &s;uffered, by the de&s;truction of almo&s;t every hou&s;e. Mountains were detached from their &s;tations and rolled again&s;t each other, burying villages in ruin. Volcanoes emitted fire, lava, and rivers of water. It is &s;aid, that 40,000 inhabitants peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>On the 11th of January 1798 a &s;hock of earthquake was felt in Lanca&s;ter, Penn&s;ylvania, and the neighboring towns, during which appeared to i&s;&s;ue from the earth a flame or blaze, like the burning of a chimney.</P>

<P>This year, 1797, was remarkable for other &s;ingular phenom|ena in Europe and America.</P>
<P>In England a pe&s;tilence among cats &s;wept away tho&s;e animals by thou&s;ands. It &s;eems that this di&s;ea&s;e began as early as April, and &s;ucceeded an epidemic catarrh among the human race. The &s;ame cat-di&s;temper was afterwards epidemic in France. A &s;o|ciety at Montpelier in&s;tituted an enquiry into this remarkable phenomenon.</P>
<P>The cat-di&s;temper appeared in Philadelphia, as early as June, and proceeded northward and ea&s;tward, like the catarrh of 1789. In Augu&s;t it was very fatal in New-York, and in the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer and autumn, it &s;pread de&s;truction among tho&s;e ani|mals over the northern &s;tates.</P>
<P>In Augu&s;t, dead fi&s;h, in great numbers, were &s;een to float down James' river, in Virginia, for many days in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Canine madne&s;s, during the &s;ame year, was unu&s;ually epidemic and attended with fatal effects, of which full accounts may be &s;een in the fir&s;t volume of the Medical Repo&s;itory.</P>
<P>The&s;e phenomena indicate an unhealthy &s;tate of the elements. But it is a remarkable fact that, in &s;ome places and &s;ea&s;ons, the principal force of the epidemic con&s;titution &s;eems to be &s;pent on <HI>one</HI> &s;pecies of animals, while others are exempt. Thus in Eng|land, the catarrh, which had affected mankind in 1797, cea&s;ed, before the epidemic &s;eized the cats. In America, the northern &s;tates, with the exception of a few places, were remarkably healthy, in 1797, while cats died in multitudes. And it is a frequent occurrence in Europe, that while the plague or &s;ome other malignant di&s;ea&s;e is afflicting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> human race in one coun|try; in another country, mankind w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> e&s;cape, and a mo&s;t terri|ble mortality will occur among cattle, hor&s;es or &s;heep.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="036687_0326_100AA305903381B8">In 1797 the bills of mortality in the northern &s;tates, which had been &s;welled very high by angina and malignant fevers, fell nearly to the &s;tandard of health. There are a few exceptions.</P>
<P>The plague appeared in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Norfolk and Charle&s;ton. In the two latter cities, it is con&s;idered, as the u&s;ual autumnal fever, with aggravated &s;ymptoms, from &s;ea|&s;on or other local or temporary cau&s;es.</P>
<P>In Baltimore, the di&s;ea&s;e appeared fir&s;t in the form of a com|mon remittent, but increa&s;ed in malignancy till late in aut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mn and became infectious. The hi&s;tory of this epidemic is minutely &s;tated by the magi&s;tracy of Baltimore, and is too intere&s;ting to be pa&s;&s;ed with a &s;light notice. The following is a correct ab|&s;tract of the &s;tatement made and publi&s;hed by authority.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners &s;tate to the mayor of the city;</P>
<P>That the fir&s;t appearance of the fever was near the end of June in two young men, Parkin and M'Kenna, who occupied a ware|hou&s;e in South-&s;treet and who died in a few days. The ware|hou&s;e was examined, and was found to contain nothing which could be the &s;pecial cau&s;e of the fever; nor is it &s;ugge&s;ted that they were infected from abroad. No per&s;on received the di&s;ea&s;e from them. From this time till the clo&s;e of Augu&s;t, We&s;t Baltimore remained in a &s;tate of unu&s;ual health.</P>
<P>In Ea&s;t Baltimore (Fell's Point) a bilious fever had &s;howed it&s;elf early in the &s;ea&s;on, and gradually &s;pread and grew wor&s;e; but was &s;uppo&s;ed to be no other than the common &s;ickne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on. It therefore excited no alarm, till the 26th Augu&s;t, when a rumor prevailed, that the fever was &s;omething <HI>more than common.</HI> The chairman of the board addre&s;&s;ed a letter to each of the phy&s;icians in that part of the city, reque&s;ting to be informed whether any ca&s;e of contagious di&s;ea&s;e had come under his ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Dr. John Coulter wrote for an&s;wer that &s;ince the third week in June, a fever had prevailed and become epidemic, affecting all de&s;criptions of people, but mo&s;tly tho&s;e who labored hard, in the heat of the &s;un, intemperate per&s;ons and tho&s;e who expo|&s;ed them&s;elves to night air after the labors of the day. The di&s;ea&s;e was violent, and unle&s;s &s;peedily a&s;&s;ailed with powerful

remedies, proved fatal. It had on that day, Augu&s;t 26th, be|come general, and "a&s;&s;umed to it&s;elf the &s;ole government of the di&s;ea&s;es," in that part of the city. "During the wet weather, in the la&s;t of July and beginning of Augu&s;t, it yielded, for near two weeks, to the dy&s;entery," which aftewards gave way to a recurrence of the yellow fever. [The reader is de&s;ired to note that fact.]</P>
<P>Dr. Coulter calls the fever an epidemic, in contradi&s;tinction to imported contagion, and &s;ays, "it is in the locality of our atmo&s;phere, the &s;ource of which I can perceive in every ten &s;teps I take in our &s;treets, ponds of &s;tagnant water, and &s;inks of putrid animal and vegetable matters, exhaling perpetually under a hot &s;un the mo&s;t offen&s;ive effluvia." The conclu&s;ion he draws is, that the di&s;ea&s;e was <HI>not individually infectious.</HI> He then men|tions the uniformity of the &s;ymptoms, and the corre&s;pondence of the fever with the di&s;ea&s;es which have prevailed in that city and in other parts of the continent for a number of years pa&s;t. He enumerates the &s;ymptoms, which are exactly the &s;ame, as ob&s;erved in New-Haven, New-York and Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Doctors Alexander and Jaquitt agree in the facts that the di&s;ea&s;e was not imported nor &s;pecifically contagious.</P>
<P>The board of health then called a meeting of the phy&s;icians in We&s;t Baltimore, and inquired whether any contagious &s;ick|ne&s;s had come under their knowledge. They an&s;wered in the negative. Three of their number, at the reque&s;t of the meeting, went to Ea&s;t Baltimore and vi&s;ited a number of the &s;ick. They reported on the 29th of Augu&s;t, that the di&s;ea&s;e was not a ma|lignant, contagious or yellow fever, but the bilious remittent. Their report quieted the alarms of people.</P>
<P>On the 2d of September the commi&s;&s;ioners were alarmed with the opinion of the phy&s;icians in that part of the city, that the <HI>di&s;ea&s;e was &s;omething more than common.</HI></P>
<P>Five members of the board, with Dr. Moores, went to the point to examin for them&s;elves. They found the di&s;ea&s;e had &s;pread, chiefly among the poor, who lived in confined dwellings &mdash;a few per&s;ons were dangerou&s;ly ill; but on the whole, were convinced that the di&s;ea&s;e was <HI>not contagious.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="036687_0328_100AA308BA425A38">The next week, the di&s;order a&s;&s;umed a more threatening a&s;pect.

Number of inhabitants at Fell's Point (where the di&s;ea&s;e principally raged) who removed during the &s;ickne&s;s 671. Tho&s;e who remained were 2679. Total 3350.</P>
<P>This plain and candid narrative of facts, which is certified by the pre&s;idents of both branches of the city council and by the mayor, Mr. Calhoun, does great honor to the integrity and dil|igence of the commi&s;&s;ioners; and <HI>if the laws of nature are to be relied on as uniform in their operation, this report alone will de|cide every di&s;puted point relative to the origin and phenomena of the yellow fever.</HI></P>
<P>It is here decided by unequivocal evidence; evidence that precludes the carping of prejudice and the ca&s;ui&s;try of intere&s;t, that the yellow fever and the bilious remittent are the <HI>&s;ame di&s;|ea&s;e,</HI> differing only in degrees of violence; and it is agreed on all hands that the remitting and intermitting fevers are the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, with a &s;imilar difference in violence.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e began at Baltimore early in the &s;ea&s;on, in June, and for more than two months, prevailed as a remitting fever of the common kind, without infection, and it is agreed on all hands not to be of imported origin. During a wet &s;ea&s;on, the damp weather ca&s;t the di&s;ea&s;e upon the inte&s;tines, and it appear|ed in the form of a dy&s;entery&mdash;a mo&s;t important fact, which proves what Dr. Lind has a&s;&s;erted, that a dy&s;entery is a yellow or malignant fever &s;eated in the bowels. The wet weather cea&s;|ing, the fever re&s;umed its former appearance, and gradually in|crea&s;ed, till it exhibited its <HI>wor&s;t forms and became infectious.</HI></P>
<P>Had the advocates for the dome&s;tic origin of this fever <HI>con|trived</HI> and directed a &s;eries of facts, to prove their own doctrines,
<PB N="325" REF="036687_0329_100AA342B5A36E18">
it would not have been po&s;&s;ible to collect &s;tronger evidence in their favor, than the report of the board of health in Baltimore.</P>
<P>In Philadelphia, the di&s;ea&s;e in 1797 appeared, in a few ca&s;es, as early as June&mdash;one on the 5th&mdash;one on the 9th&mdash;one on the 15th and another on the 22d. The&s;e ca&s;es, in&s;tead of being con&s;idered as proofs of a pe&s;tilential air, and precur&s;ors of more general &s;ickne&s;s, are thrown entirely out of the que&s;tion, by the advocates of imported fomites. The divi&s;ion of opinions, which originated in 1793, relative to the cau&s;es and origin of that di&s;|ea&s;e, was revived with a&s;perity. One party among phy&s;icians contended that the di&s;temper was introduced into the city by the &s;hip Arethu&s;a, which arrived from Jamaica and Havanna, on the 23d of July. Another party believed the &s;ources of the di&s;ea&s;e to have been, noxious exhalations from putrid &s;ub&s;tances in the city, with an augment from the foul air of the &s;now Nav|igation from Mar&s;eilles. The evidence to &s;upport each of the&s;e opinions, is publi&s;hed in the proceedings of the College of Phy|&s;icians, and of the Academy of Medicin.</P>
<P>The city of Philadelphia was de&s;erted by a great proportion of its inhabitants, and thus the mortality was limited to about one thou&s;and victims. It prevailed principally in the &s;uburbs.</P>
<P>This epidemic was followed as u&s;ual by the influenza.</P>
<P>By foreign publications, it appears that the catarrh was epi|demic in England in the four fir&s;t months of 1797. I have no particulars of the violence or extent of this di&s;order; but if it was &s;evere and general, no event is more certain than that &s;ickly &s;ea&s;ons will follow.</P>
<P>What confirms this opinion, is, that in the following &s;ummer, the plague raged in Con&s;tantinople, on the Barbary coa&s;t, and in Cor&s;ica. It appears by an official letter of the French min|i&s;ter Sotin, that there was a difference of opinion in regard to the epidemic in Cor&s;ica&mdash;&s;ome calling it the plague; others, a malignant fever. Tho&s;e who called it the plague, were prepar|ed to account for it, by the tale of a Turki&s;h ve&s;&s;el wrecked upon the i&s;land, with di&s;ea&s;ed people on board. But the di&s;ea&s;e &s;ub&s;ided without very exten&s;ive ravages.</P>
<P>This malignant fever however occa&s;ioned no &s;mall alarm in England. The government &s;ent orders to &s;hips crui&s;ing in the
<PB N="326" REF="036687_0330_100AA30D514806C8">
Mediterranean to have no communication with ve&s;&s;els from Cor|&s;ica, and a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued ordering &s;trict quarantine to be performed by all ve&s;&s;els from Cor&s;ica, Minorca, Gibraltar and Spain within the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>In 1797 the bilious plague carried off forty-five of the in|habitants of Providence. Of this di&s;ea&s;e, I have a minute and judicious account from Mr. Mo&s;es Brown, which is here a|bridged.</P>
<P>In 1791, the year when the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appeared in the We&s;t-Indies and New-York, &s;everal per&s;ons died of a &s;imilar fever in Providence. Two women died in one family, near the centre of the town, after three days illne&s;s. They vomitted bilious matter, and were yellow, with livid and purple &s;pots. The &s;econd, being &s;eized two days after the death of the fir&s;t, might have taken the di&s;ea&s;e by infection; but no &s;u&s;picion ex|i&s;ted that the fir&s;t had acce&s;s to any infecting cau&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 14th of Augu&s;t died another per&s;on in a different part of the town, and on the 21&s;t of September, a fourth, with &s;imilar &s;ymptoms. As no alarm had then been excited by yel|low fever, little notice was taken of the&s;e ca&s;es; but the attend|ing phy&s;ician, a re&s;pectable character, who vi&s;ited many patients in 1797 and was affected with the di&s;ea&s;e him&s;elf, has &s;ince pro|nounced the di&s;ea&s;e of 1791 and of 1797 to be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>A ca&s;e very &s;imilar to the&s;e occurred in September 1792; and on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river, prevailed a &s;ingular epidemic, in which per&s;ons became yellow, with black urine, co&s;tive bow|els, pains in the right hypochondrium, without fever. Some had petechial &s;pots, and one per&s;on, petechia, vibices and hemhor|age, yet the di&s;ea&s;e was not mortal, nor malignant.</P>
<P>In 1793 a per&s;on from Philadelphia was ill and died of the yellow fever in Providence, but no other was infected.</P>
<P>In 1794 &s;everal per&s;ons had the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, but they took it probably in Carolina, where they had been on a voyage; the di&s;ea&s;e did not &s;pread by infection.</P>
<P>On the 11th of July 1795, died Capt. J. Gifford, a re&s;pect|able man, of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e. No infection was &s;uppo&s;ed in the ca&s;e&mdash;he was buried under arms, but no inconvenience was experienced from it, at the time. Yet two years after, viz. in
<PB N="327" REF="036687_0331_100AA345174D0AC8">
1797, his family were affected with the di&s;order, at the time when it became epidemic in the neighborhood.</P>
<P>Several other ca&s;es occurred, in the &s;ame year, and one of them exhibited infection.</P>
<P>The&s;e ca&s;es demon&s;trate a pe&s;tilential principle exi&s;ting in that town, in every &s;ea&s;on from 1791 to 1795 inclu&s;ive; at the time when other parts of the United States were more &s;everely afflicted. They were the di&s;tant precur&s;ors of a more general calamity in that town, which did not arrive till 1797.</P>
<P>Sporadic ca&s;es of pe&s;tilential fever do not render it <HI>certain</HI> but <HI>probable,</HI> that the di&s;ea&s;e will, in a future &s;ea&s;on, become epi|demic. In 1796 cholera infantum and dy&s;entery were prevalent.</P>
<P>In 1797 the hydrophobia was prevalent in the &s;tate of Rhode-I&s;land, as well as in other &s;tates. One T. Lyon was bitten by a dog, the wound healed, and he was &s;eized four months after, and died. The pe&s;tilence among cats prevailed al&s;o in Provi|dence.</P>
<P>In this year al&s;o prevailed at We&s;tport in the &s;ame &s;tate, and on Nantucket i&s;land, a very malignant epidemic dy&s;entery. At We&s;tport died 30 patients of 79 who were &s;eized. On Nan|tucket the di&s;ea&s;e was le&s;s mortal; about 100 died out of 2000 patients. On examination, it was found that under the hou&s;e of the family fir&s;t &s;eized, there were &s;ome barrels of putrid fi&s;h, and other nau&s;eous matter.</P>
<P>It was &s;uppo&s;ed al&s;o, that the di&s;ea&s;e might have been aug|mented by the effluvia of a large pond, at &s;ome miles di&s;tance, which had become &s;tagnant, filled with gra&s;s, and the &s;hores &s;trewed with dead fi&s;h. A number of men, on this di&s;covery, opened a trench to drain off the water, and let in the tides, af|ter which, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, the di&s;ea&s;e a&s;&s;umed a le&s;s malignant a&s;pect.</P>
<P>The pe&s;tilential condition of the air at Providence in 1797, manife&s;ted it&s;elf very early in the &s;ea&s;on; the fir&s;t death occur|ring as early as May 5th&mdash;the next on the 25th of June&mdash;the third on the 4th of July&mdash;the fourth on the 27th&mdash;the fifth on the 29th, and the &s;ixth on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t. The &s;ymptoms in all the&s;e ca&s;es, were the predominant ones of the true yellow
<PB N="328" REF="036687_0332_100AA30B0B018CF8">
fever; and the bodies exhibited more or le&s;s petechiae and bices. The&s;e ca&s;es occurred <HI>before</HI> the arrival of the &s;chooner, to which popular clamor afterwards imputed the whole evil. The&s;e were the &s;cattered precur&s;ors, which, had the &s;ubject of pe&s;tilence ever been inve&s;tigated, with philo&s;ophical ingenuity and Chri&s;tian candor, would have rendered the epidemic a prob|able event to the citizens of Providence, as early as July and would have taught them to u&s;e all human means to avoid or miti|gate the calamity.</P>
<P>On the 8th of Augu&s;t arrived the &s;chooner Bet&s;ey, Capt. Barton, from the Mole of Cape Nicholas, after 24 days pa&s;|&s;age. Her cargo was only a few hog&s;heads of coffee. She lay at the wharf, till the 20th, when an increa&s;ing alarm from new ca&s;es of the fever induced the police to order her to be removed and clean&s;ed.</P>
<P>On enquiry, it was found that three of the &s;chooner's people had been ill in the We&s;t-Indies, but no one died. One of the&s;e only had been ill on the pa&s;&s;age, but had recovered &s;o as to do duty, &s;even days before her arrival. There were five per|&s;ons on board, during the pa&s;&s;age, none of whom were affected by di&s;ea&s;e from infection or other cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The death of Mr. Arnold, the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officer, who was &s;aid to have vi&s;ited the &s;chooner, and &s;everal of his family, gave ri&s;e to the report that the fever began from fomes on board of her. This point will be hereafter di&s;proved. Certain it is, that another officer of the cu&s;toms &s;lept on board of the &s;choon|er <HI>&s;even</HI> nights; another <HI>five,</HI> and another young man <HI>two</HI> nights, with Brown, the owner of the blankets hereafter to be mention|ed; all of whom e&s;caped di&s;ea&s;e of any kind.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o &s;aid that the woman who wa&s;hed two blankets, belonging to a di&s;ea&s;ed &s;eaman, took the fever and died. On inve&s;tigation, this proved to be an idle tale. The blankets were owned by one Brown, who had not been &s;ick; and not having any u&s;e for them in warm weather, they had lain in his che&s;t. On his arrival, they were carried home, &s;pread out on the fence to air; they were then carried to his &s;i&s;ter's to be wa&s;hed and lay two days before the work was undertaken. The day
<PB N="329" REF="036687_0333_100AA346C4BCA968">
after the wa&s;hing, the women were taken ill; which was two early for the operation of infection, unle&s;s highly concentrated. But in fact the blankets were not infected; never having been u&s;ed by any di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on; and the mother and others who handled them, when fir&s;t opened, never had the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>But &s;tronger circum&s;tances attended this ca&s;e. The blanket belonging to Rophy, the only &s;ick man, on the pa&s;&s;age, and his other clothes, worn during his fever, and colored yellow, by his per&s;piration, were carried to his hou&s;e; the blanket &s;pread out for children to play on, before it was wa&s;hed; afterwards wa&s;hed by his wife; and no per&s;on took any di&s;ea&s;e from his clothes or blanket.</P>
<P>Such are tales of imported di&s;ea&s;es, rai&s;ed by ignorance and propagated by intere&s;t, pride or credulity, to which the bu&s;ine&s;s of the merchants and the commerce of the country are to be &s;acrificed!</P>
<P>Many other reports were &s;pread about the infection from this &s;chooner which, upon &s;trict enquiry, were found to be equally groundle&s;s. Such as the introduction of the fever into Warren, where the ve&s;&s;el &s;topped, on her way to Providence. The ca&s;e was, one Cole, an officer of the cu&s;toms, &s;culled a large boat a mile or two, again&s;t the tide, in a foggy evening; went on board, wet and fatigued; without refre&s;hment or change of clothes, &s;lept in a cabin with broken windows, took a &s;evere cold; repeated his vi&s;it to the &s;chooner the next day; on the third day went to Providence, a di&s;tance of ten miles in the rain; tarried two nights without a change of clothes; returned on foot, and was taken ill of a bilious fever and died in about &s;even days. Yet after all this fatigue and imprudence in the man, enough in all con&s;cience to kill him, men are found weak enough to charge his di&s;ea&s;e to the &s;chooner.</P>
<P>But it happens, that other &s;imilar ca&s;es of fever occurred in Warren, in per&s;ons who had never vi&s;ited Cole or the &s;chooner; and one at the di&s;tance of three miles from the town. The whole tale therefore comes to nothing.</P>
<P>One fact more, and I will quit the &s;ubject of correcting the popular errors on this head. The men belonging to the &s;chooner
<PB N="330" REF="036687_0334_100AA30F31DF41F8">
were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed at Providence and returned to their families, with their &s;ea clothes of cour&s;e. My informant took pains to enquire of every family, whether any of them had been infected; and he found not one in&s;tance, altho the families con&s;i&s;ted of about forty &s;ouls!&mdash;The ca&s;e of the unfortunate family of Mr. Arnold would a ford &s;ome &s;light ground to &s;u&s;pect the infection to be communicated from the &s;chooner to him or his &s;on, the latter having vi&s;ited her;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not rendered certain that the father had been on board; but that the &s;on had, is not que&s;tioned; &s;o had at lea&s;t one hundred others, who were not afterward affected with the di&s;ea&s;e.</NOTE> but it happens that Mr. Arnold's wife, who had <HI>not</HI> been on board, nor otherwi&s;e expo&s;ed, was &s;eized fifty-&s;ix hours <HI>before</HI> her &s;on and more than three days <HI>before</HI> her hu&s;|band. Thus the reports of infection from abroad, when well &s;ifted, vani&s;h into &s;moke; and I am per&s;uaded this would gene|rally be the re&s;ult, if men would be faithful to them&s;elves, to truth and their country.</P>
<P>On the 12th of Augu&s;t, the fever took a more rapid &s;pread, probably from a &s;udden alarm by the burning of two tons of hemp, by means of a &s;park from a black&s;mith's &s;hop, as it was pa&s;&s;ing the door. This was four days after the arrival of the &s;chooner, and occa&s;ioned the popular clamor which was rai&s;ed about her infection. But the appearance of the di&s;ea&s;e long <HI>before</HI> her arrival is deci&s;ive of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e had its own atmo&s;phere; raging mo&s;tly in a part of Providence much expo&s;ed to the effluvia of great collections of filth in vaults, from a di&s;tillery, and in other places. Some ca&s;es however occurred in other &s;ituations; and many parts of the &s;tate exhibited the pe&s;tilential principle, in &s;poradic ca&s;es, or local epidemics, as at Bri&s;tol, Warren, Greenwich, Indian Point, Glouce&s;ter, Warwick, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In Providence, the di&s;ea&s;e affected fifty-&s;ix families&mdash;8 before the arrival of the &s;chooner, and 48 afterwards. In 33 of the&s;e families, only one per&s;on in each, had the fever; and as &s;ome of the families are large, the infecting principle could not have been very powerful. In the large hou&s;e, where lived the women who were fir&s;t taken ill, after the &s;chooner arrived, re&s;ided 9
<PB N="331" REF="036687_0335_100AA349DB0505D0">
families, con&s;i&s;ting of 37 per&s;ons, only 12 of which were af|fected. In the ho&s;pital the nur&s;es and attendants <HI>all</HI> e&s;caped.</P>
<P>Some in&s;tances of this di&s;ea&s;e appeared in the following win|ter; and there were ca&s;es al&s;o of the ulcerous &s;ore throat. In the north part of the town, &s;ome ca&s;es of the yellow fever oc|curred in the la&s;t &s;ummer&mdash;1798.</P>
<P>In 1797 a malignant fever is &s;aid to have been introduced in|to a village in Chatham, on Connecticut river, by a ve&s;&s;el from the We&s;t-Indies. I under&s;tand that it was confined to a clu&s;ter of hou&s;es by the water; but I have not been able to collect the facts in detail, altho I have written letters for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>During the late pe&s;tilential period, the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere produced its u&s;ual effects in winter; which appeared in the ex|traordinary &s;ymptoms of pleuri&s;y and peripneumony.</P>
<P>It has already been remarked that in periods when plague and other mortal epidemics rage in &s;ummer, the di&s;ea&s;es of winter a&s;&s;ume new &s;ymptoms. The pleuri&s;y, at &s;uch times, has often become epidemic and even infectious. It is in fact a modification of the &s;ame pe&s;tilential principle, as that which renders bilious fevers in &s;ummer epidemic and infectious. The fatal effects of this &s;pecies of pleuri&s;y in Connecticut, in the winter of 1761, have been mentioned.</P>
<P>In the winter of 1795-6, after the epidemic in New-York, &s;everal ca&s;es of a &s;imilar kind occurred, and an able phy&s;ician of plethoric habit and &s;trong fibres, fell a victim to a peripneumony, with anomalous &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>In the following winter, a &s;imilar di&s;order attacked many people in Connecticut. Three men in Hartford, of one family, two brothers and a cou&s;in, all men of robu&s;t health, were at|tacked and carried off in the compa&s;s of a few days. Others of the &s;ame family, and &s;everal per&s;ons of a &s;imilar habit were affected, but recovered. It was far le&s;s general than in 1761.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies of pleuri&s;y appeared in Philadelphia as early as September 1791, the month when the malignant fever prevailed in New-York. A patient of Dr. Ru&s;h had a "red face, infla|med eyes, a perpetual to&s;&s;ing and &s;ighing, &s;trong animal powers, but weak pul&s;e and &s;izy blood." In February 1792 many ca&s;es of &s;imilar pleuritic fevers occurred in Philadelphia&mdash;di&s;ea&s;es a&s;|&s;umed
<PB N="332" REF="036687_0336_100AA3136B9593D8">
the inflammatory diathe&s;is which has remarkably charac|terized the epidemic of the la&s;t pe&s;tilential period.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of the year 1798, a mortal fever raged in Fred|ericktown, Maryland, beginning with la&s;&s;itude, chills and pain in the head, and producing, on the third day, vertigo and &s;pa&s;m in the brea&s;t.</P>
<BIBL>Letter from Dr. Baltzell to Dr. Ru&s;h, dated May 2, 1798.</BIBL>
<P>In &s;ummer and autumn of 1797, a malignant fever, attended with dy&s;entery, was epidemic in Portland and its vicinity, in the di&s;trict of Maine. The dy&s;entery &s;ub&s;ided in October, but the fever continued. It appeared in the country, as well as town; and was u&s;ually conquered by the u&s;e of alkaline reme|dies. Many of the patients had a yellow &s;kin and the predomi|nant &s;ymptoms of the yellow fever of our cities. In one in&s;tance, this di&s;ea&s;e put on the form of pe&s;tilence. A merchant, in a country village, where no &s;u&s;picion of infection could be enter|tained, was &s;eized with a malignant fever; he lingered till the 36th day, and died highly putrid. His nur&s;e was &s;eized and died; after death appeared livid &s;pots on the body. A &s;ervant al&s;o took the di&s;ea&s;e and died. The nur&s;e communicated the di&s;ea&s;e to three per&s;ons in the family where &s;he lay ill.</P>
<P>This la&s;t in&s;tance is deci&s;ive evidence that the pe&s;tilential yel|low fever not only originates in our country, but in villages, in the 44th degree of latitude, a more temperate climate than that of New-York and Philadelphia.</P>
<P>In the winter &s;ucceeding, the pe&s;tilential principle &s;till exhib|ited its effects. The fever continued to prevail, being u&s;hered in with nau&s;ea, vomiting and chills &s;ucceeded by heat; but it was generally accompanied with a &s;ore throat and &s;carlet efflo|re&s;cence. It prevailed in almo&s;t every town in the county.</P>
<BIBL>Dr. Barker's letter, Med. Repo&s;. vol. 2. 147.</BIBL>
<P>The year 1798 was remarkable for the mo&s;t general preva|lence of the plague of our climate, that has been known; and in &s;ome cities, the di&s;ea&s;e was peculiarly malignant.</P>
<P>The preceding winter had been unu&s;ually long and cold&mdash;the May following was dry beyond what is recollected in any former years&mdash;June was remarkable for deluging rains, which occa&s;ioned floods in the Connecticut, Delaware and Su&s;quehannah rivers,
<PB N="333" REF="036687_0337_100AA34C30414D50">
which did no incon&s;iderable injury. Two or three of the fir&s;t days of July were exce&s;&s;ively hot, and &s;ucceeded by twenty days of very cool weather&mdash;then commenced a long period of the mo&s;t &s;ultry weather ever known in our climate, accompanied, in &s;ome places, with great rains.</P>
<P>Catarrhous fevers were frequent in the &s;pring, the con&s;tant forerunners of autumnal &s;ickne&s;s. Bilious fevers al&s;o occurred, in a few ca&s;es very early, indicating the predominant condition of the atmo&s;phere. In &s;ummer and autumn, the gra&s;s-hoppers multiplied to &s;uch a degree from Penn&s;ylvania to New-England, as to devour vegetables, and e&s;&s;entially injure the pa&s;tures and gra&s;s fields.</P>
<P>The pe&s;tilential fever in Philadelphia appeared early in the &s;ea&s;on&mdash;a number of ca&s;es in June, and &s;till more in July. In Augu&s;t early, the city was alarmed and &s;oon de&s;erted by at lea&s;t three fourths of its inhabitants. The di&s;ea&s;e was unu&s;ually mor|tal; and extended to the remote&s;t parts of the city, where it had not formerly prevailed. Owing to this circum&s;tance, &s;ome families &s;uffered, which had e&s;caped in former years. The num|ber of deaths amounted to about 3440. The di&s;ea&s;e, as u&s;ual, abated with the appearance of fro&s;t; but individuals were at|tacked with it, and carried off, in the mid&s;t of the following winter.</P>
<P>It is alledged by &s;ome per&s;ons that the fever was introduced into Philadelphia by the &s;hip Deborah, which arrived from Jer|emie, and anchored near Race-&s;treet wharf, on the 18th of July. It is admitted that per&s;ons who went on board, &s;oon af|ter &s;ickened and died; and &s;o did others &s;icken and die, without going near that &s;hip. The truth is, many ca&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e had occurred three or four weeks, <HI>before her arrival.</HI> The &s;hip had lo&s;t people by fever on her pa&s;&s;age and might be infected; and per&s;ons vi&s;iting her might receive that infection; but the&s;e facts do not reach the point. The epidemic <HI>began</HI> in all parts of the city, in &s;cattering ca&s;es, <HI>previous to the arrival of this fo|mes,</HI> and had the &s;hip never arrived, that epidemic would have ravaged the city. This is evident from the number of its pre|cur&s;ors.</P>
<P>This pe&s;tilential fever carried off fifty-&s;even per&s;ons in the
<PB N="334" REF="036687_0338_100AA314F4213700">
village of Marcus Hook, where the fir&s;t per&s;ons &s;eized were a &s;hallop-man and others from Philadelphia. But many ca&s;es oc|curred which could be traced to no infection. See Dr. Sayre's letter in Currie's Memoirs, p. 136. In Che&s;ter died 50 of the &s;ame fever.</P>
<P>At Wilmington, in the &s;tate of Delaware, thirty miles from Philadelphia, the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e raged with more than its ordinary mortality. Its victims amounted to 250. It appears that the di&s;ea&s;e was introduced by the fugitives from Philadelphia, and by watermen who ply between Wilmington and Philadelphia.</P>
<BIBL>See Dr. Tilton's letter in Dr. Currie's Memoirs, p. 138.</BIBL>
<P>The fever al&s;o prevailed in New-Ca&s;tle and at Duck creek in the &s;ame &s;tate.</P>
<P>Letters from re&s;pectable phy&s;icians, in the public prints, have informed us that this di&s;ea&s;e prevailed al&s;o in &s;ome parts of New-Jer&s;ey, as at Bridgetown and Woodbury; and e&s;pecially near the meadows on the borders of the Delaware. From careful examination, it was found that the di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t have originated where it exi&s;ted; no intercour&s;e having been held with infected places. In &s;ome in&s;tances the fever was probably infectious.</P>
<P>At Norwalk in Connecticut &s;everal per&s;ons died of the &s;ame di&s;temper. The phy&s;icians are doubtful as to its origin; as &s;ome ca&s;es may be traced to a di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on who had been in New-York. Three ca&s;es however occurred at &s;ome miles di&s;tance from the heart of the town, in per&s;ons who had not been in the lea&s;t expo&s;ed to infection.</P>
<BIBL>M. S. letter from Dr. Betts.</BIBL>
<P>In the fir&s;t week of Augu&s;t, appeared a bilious fever in New-York, between Old &s;lip and Coenties &s;lip, in the &s;treet next to the water; a place remarked for great accumulations of filthy &s;ub&s;tances. By the exertions of the Health Commi&s;&s;ioners, in covering the&s;e nui&s;ances with fre&s;h earth, this alarming fever &s;ub&s;ided in that neighborhood, and di&s;appeared by the 26th of that month.</P>
<P>But on the 12th, the pe&s;tilential fever appeared in other parts of the city, and about the 20th, began to extend and a&s;&s;ume a more formidable a&s;pect. The di&s;trict of the city, &s;ubjected to its mo&s;t deadly effects, was that &s;ection comprehended between
<PB N="335" REF="036687_0339_100AA34E855A02A8">
John-&s;treet and Beekman-&s;treet, particularly in Cliff-&s;treet and its neighborhood. The probable cau&s;e of this effect, was the fetid air from large quantities of &s;poiled beef, &s;tored in the cel|lars in Pearl-&s;treet, on the windward &s;ide of this &s;ection. The cellars were filled with water by heavy rains, or were other|wi&s;e damp; which circum&s;tance, added to the extreme heat of the &s;ea&s;on, occa&s;ioned a greater lo&s;s of &s;alted provi&s;ions, than perhaps was ever before known. To augment the effect, large quantities of pickle had been di&s;charged, in the proce&s;s of re|packing beef not yet &s;poiled, but in a bad &s;tate, which pickle had been carried by the gutters into a &s;ewer in Burling &s;lip, from which i&s;&s;ued a very offen&s;ive &s;mell.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There is rea&s;on to believe, that &s;alt, if not &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve the article to which it is applied, renders it doubly noxious in a &s;tate of putrefaction; and that a &s;mall quantity of &s;alt will accelerate the pro|ce&s;s of putrefaction. From an experiment related to me by Mr. Mo&s;es Brown of Providence, it is proved that a piece of fle&s;h, in pure water, will not putrefy as &s;oon as in water, in which a few grains of &s;alt have been di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>Do not the &s;aline particles of the air, on the &s;ea coa&s;t, render the putrefaction of fle&s;h and vegetables more rapid, and the exhalations more deleterious, than perfectly fre&s;h water? And is not this one cau&s;e, why pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es appear fir&s;t, and are mo&s;t general, in mari|time places?</P>
<P>Dr. Cog&s;well informs me that a boat-man on Connecticut river, in the hot weather of 1798, contracted a violent fever of which he died, by &s;leeping in an open boat, near a quantity of pickle which had leaked out of a barrel of &s;alted provi&s;ions. The di&s;ea&s;e was of a very ma|lignant kind.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>About the la&s;t of Augu&s;t, the inhabitants of New-York were greatly alarmed; &s;ome removed from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t &s;ide of Broadway, a part of the city which has hitherto been exempted from the violent effects of the yellow fever; but a great pro|portion of the people de&s;erted the city. The di&s;ea&s;e was more malignant, than in its preceding vi&s;its, and exhibited more fre|quently the bubo and carbuncle. It extended over two thirds of the city, and numbered with the dead about two thou&s;and of its inhabitants. I am informed the di&s;ea&s;e was le&s;s generally characterized with the inflammatory diathe&s;is, and that vene&s;ec|tion was le&s;s generally attended with &s;alutary effects, than in for|mer years.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e exhibited little infection, beyond the limits of its own amo&s;phere. In the ho&s;pital, at a little di&s;tance from the
<PB N="336" REF="036687_0340_100AA317341B10C8">
city, were admitted about 300 patients, ill with that di&s;ea&s;e; yet &s;ixteen nur&s;es, &s;even wa&s;herwomen, and the boatmen who conveyed the &s;ick from the city to the ho&s;pital, <HI>all e&s;caped.</HI> Dr. Dougla&s;s, the attending phy&s;ician, e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e, until October, when he vi&s;ited his friends and &s;lept <HI>in the city,</HI> three days after which he was &s;eized with the fever.</P>
<BIBL>See Letters from the Health-Office, by Dr. Bailey, who&s;e zeal, talents and indu&s;try, in his employment, have rarely been equalled.</BIBL>
<P>The la&s;t fact is very important towards correcting the popular errors re&s;pecting the contagion of this fever. In the city per|&s;ons took the fever&mdash;in the ho&s;pital they did not. That is, the di&s;temper has an atmo&s;phere, in which it is readily contracted&mdash; beyond that atmo&s;phere, it is not infectious. In other words, it is a <HI>condition of the atmo&s;phere,</HI> and <HI>not the effluvia from the &s;ick,</HI> which is to be dreaded.</P>
<P>Thus, in 1797, the fugitives and &s;ick from Philadelphia did <HI>not</HI> &s;pread the fever in Wilmington&mdash;in 1798, they did. That is, in 1797 the atmo&s;phere of Wilmington would not <HI>generate</HI> and <HI>nur&s;e</HI> the di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;in 1798, it would.</P>
<P>In Bo&s;ton, the di&s;ea&s;e began near the town dock and the neighboring wharves, in the month of June; but its mo&s;t vio|lent effects were experienced on the &s;outh &s;ide of Fort-Hill, an elevated part of the town and expo&s;ed to free air. This cir|cum&s;tance has occa&s;ioned no &s;mall &s;urpri&s;e; but as the fever of 1796 began in that part of the town, perhaps we may find the cau&s;e in the very exten&s;ive flat, between Bo&s;ton and Dorche&s;ter point, which is uncovered at low water; perhaps in the expo|&s;ure of that hill to the direct rays of the &s;un; perhaps in the na|ture of the &s;oil which is clay of a &s;olid texture, and fitted to re|tain on its &s;urface whatever impure &s;ub&s;tances are thrown from hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The fever afterwards invaded the north part of the town, and a &s;treet near the pond; &s;uppo&s;ed to be excited by noxious exha|lations. Some parts of the town, which are low and filthy, e&s;|caped the fever.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t it attacked the mo&s;t robu&s;t young men, and the diath|e&s;is was highly inflammatory. Later in the &s;ea&s;on, it attacked
<PB N="337" REF="036687_0341_100AA35100B63870">
per&s;ons of all ages and habits. At fir&s;t it was not infectious, but in the later &s;tages of its progre&s;s, it exhibited infection. Is di&s;appeared with the arrival of fro&s;t, after carrying off nearly 200 patients.</P>

<P>See a full account of the di&s;ea&s;e in a letter from Dr. Rand, publi&s;hed by order of the Academy of Arts and Sciences. This gentleman ob&s;erves that no infection appeared, except in places where the di&s;ea&s;e was originally contracted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, infection was attached to the <HI>place,</HI> rather than to the <HI>per&s;ons</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;ed&mdash;a fact which is true of every pe&s;tilence.</NOTE></P>
<BIBL>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Mercury, Feb. 8, 1799.</BIBL>
<P>The &s;ame malady appeared in Port&s;mouth, New-Hamp&s;hire, with equal mortality, as far as it extended; but its progre&s;s was limited to one &s;treet near the water.</P>
<P>New-London, in Connecticut, is &s;ituated in a very healthy part of the country, on a harbor, who&s;e &s;hores as well as the &s;urrounding lands, are dry and rocky&mdash;its population about 3000 inhabitants.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t week in Augu&s;t 1798, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> town was &s;uddenly in|vaded by the plague of our country, which began in the family of Mr. Bingham, keeper of the Union coffee-hou&s;e. No ve&s;|&s;els from the We&s;t-Indies, no &s;ick from other places, occur, in this in&s;tance, to help out popular credulity. The idea of im|portation is abandoned by the citizens of the town. The fever was very fatal within its atmo&s;phere, which was confined to Bank &s;treet and its vicinity; a part of the city well built, clean and airy as any &s;treet in the town. Within a &s;mall &s;pace, were fifteen hou&s;es, inhabited by ninety-two per&s;ons&mdash;of which ninety were affected with the di&s;ea&s;e; thirty-three of this number died, and two only e&s;caped the fever. The di&s;ea&s;e prevailed about eight weeks and de&s;troyed eighty-one lives.</P>
<BIBL>Printed account of the fever by Charles Holt.</BIBL>
<P>On enquiry I find that this di&s;ea&s;e in New-London had its precur&s;ors, in &s;poradic ca&s;es of the &s;ame fever, in the three pre|ceding &s;ummers. In 1795, died Dr. Jo&s;eph W. Lee with all the &s;ymptoms of the yellow fever. Some in&s;tances occurred in
<PB N="338" REF="036687_0342_100AA318D943D5A0">
1796; and in 1797 died of the &s;ame, Matthew Gri&s;wold, E&s;q. and &s;oon after his mother; indicating the communication of in|fection. Yet in the&s;e years, it did not &s;pread and become epi|demic. The pe&s;tilential period however was progre&s;&s;ing in that town, as appears by the bills of mortality; for the ordinary number of deaths does not exceed 60 in a healthy year; but in 1795, the number amounted to 86&mdash;in 1796, to 80&mdash;in 1797, to 101&mdash;in 1798, to 133. Here we ob&s;erve a great augmenta|tion in the mortality of the town, &s;everal years before the cri&s;is of pe&s;tilence, and e&s;pecially in the year next preceding it. The importance of this fact towards a right under&s;tanding of the cau&s;es of epidemic pe&s;tilence, cannot be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Con&s;iderable quantities of &s;alted fi&s;h, which lay in certain &s;tores in New-London, and which had not been well cured with the u&s;ual quantity of &s;alt, became fetid and offen&s;ive, altho not pu|trid, and a&s;&s;umed a red ca&s;t with a &s;limy feeling&mdash;it al&s;o lo&s;t its texture and firmne&s;s. This was opened and &s;pread in the &s;treets for the purpo&s;e of being dried; and from its offen&s;ivene&s;s and vicinity to the place where the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appeared, it is &s;uppo|&s;ed to have been an exciting cau&s;e of the fever. This opinion has doubtle&s;s &s;ome foundation; but putrid fi&s;h will not always occa&s;ion di&s;ea&s;e. It is probably true that the bad &s;tate of the fi&s;h was partly owing to a previous bad &s;tate of the air; altho it afterwards became a <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of a <HI>wor&s;e &s;tate</HI> of the air.</P>
<P>What &s;eems to put this beyond doubt, is, the unu&s;ual number of mu&s;ketoes, in the adjacent country, and the multitudes of flies of uncommon &s;ize, exceeding what had been before ob&s;er|ved. With the&s;e phenomena before our eyes, we can be at no lo&s;s to account for the pe&s;tilential fever of New-London.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual lake and river fever prevailed in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, in many of the interior parts of the country; as at Royalton in Vermont, on the Grand I&s;les in Lake Champlain, at New-Mil|ford in Connecticut, and in various parts of the &s;tate of New-York; in which places, it was attended with con&s;iderable mor|tality. Sporadic ca&s;es occurred in all parts, and in the healthie&s;t &s;ituations, of the country. In many places, intermittents and dy&s;entery were unu&s;ually violent and ob&s;tinate.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="036687_0343_100A89BFFB4654E8">I have no account of the temperature of the weather in any part of Europe, during the &s;ummer of 1798; except that in &s;ome parts of Sweden, the fir&s;t months of the &s;ummer were ex|ce&s;&s;ively dry, as the month of May was in America.</P>
<P>A pe&s;tilential fever appeared in Italy in June; but I have no details of its progre&s;s. It is however to be ob&s;erved that this fever was preceded by a violent earthquake in &s;ome part of the Tu&s;can territories, in the month of May, which did no &s;mall injury.</P>
<P>In autumn broke out a pe&s;tilential fever on the Baltic, in Dant|zick or its vicinity. The government of Denmark, in con&s;e|quence of official information of the prevalence of this di&s;ea&s;e, directed all &s;hips from Dantzick and the neighboring ports to be watched with vigilance, and appointed a committee of quarantine.</P>
<P>According to the report of a ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el, there was an eruption in Teneriffe in the &s;ummer of 1798, which la&s;ted &s;ev|eral weeks. This volcano had been quiet for 94 years.</P>
<P>In November and December, the pe&s;tilence in America was &s;ucceeded as u&s;ual by influenza, which was very prevalent in all parts of the country, and in the &s;outhern &s;tates attended with &s;ome mortality. This was merely a change of the form of the epidemic.</P>
<P>The winter of 1798-9 was very long and &s;evere in both hem|i&s;pheres. In the United States, it began about the middle of November, with &s;now, and a heavy fall of &s;now on the 18th and 19th was followed by &s;evere cold that la&s;ted till the &s;econd week in January. From this time, there was a relaxation of cold for about three weeks, and the ice in Connecticut river gave way. But in February commenced &s;evere cold, which contin|ued, for the mo&s;t part to the vernal equinox. April was al&s;o cold; &s;evere fro&s;ts occurred often, and checked vegetation. On the 2d and 8th of May were con&s;iderable falls of &s;now, followed by fro&s;t. On the morning of the 4th and 5th, we had ice at New-Haven as thick as window-gla&s;s. Peaches blo&s;&s;omed about the middle of May, and apples were not in full bloom, till the 22d. This long duration of cold exhau&s;ted all the barns of hay and other fodder, and multitudes of cattle peri&s;hed in various parts of the country.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="036687_0344_100AA31CE3DA8B08">In Europe, the winter was equally &s;evere. The rivers in England, Germany, Holland and France were covered with &s;olid ice, and at the breaking up of winter, the Rhine ro&s;e and bur&s;t its barriers, inundating many parts of Holland with terri|ble de&s;truction. The &s;everity of the winter was felt even in the &s;outh of Italy, and the French and Neapolitan troops &s;uffered greatly from &s;now on the Appenine, in the vicinity of Naples. In Siberia, we are informed by the public prints, peri&s;hed whole villages of men and cattle by the &s;everity of the fro&s;t.</P>
<P>In America, the di&s;ea&s;es of the winter were characterized by the predominant diathe&s;is of the reigning epidemic con&s;titution, a yellow &s;kin and bilious di&s;charges. An earthquake of con&s;id|erable extent was felt in the Carolinas on the 12th of April. What will be the &s;tate of health in the en&s;uing &s;ummer, mu&s;t be left to be determined by the event.

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT. Additional facts, collected on a journey which I made through the Northern States, while this volume was in the pre&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>IN the autumn of 1732 raged in New-York a malignant, in|fectious fever, of which died &s;eventy per&s;ons in a few weeks.</P>
<BIBL>M. S. of Mr. Alexander.</BIBL>
<P>In 1745 a malignant bilious fever prevailed in New-York, of which died an eminent phy&s;ician of the city, Dr. Nicoll. By the de&s;cription of the di&s;ea&s;e, given to me by a gentleman who was affected with it, there appears to be no que&s;tion that it was the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e now called yellow fever.</P>
<P>About this time, for the year is not exactly known, a malig|nant epidemic di&s;ea&s;e laid wa&s;te the Indian tribes. By the de|&s;cription of the &s;ymptoms, as given by Indian traders, then among the tribes, and &s;till living, it is certain this was the infec|tious yellow fever. In con&s;equence of this di&s;temper, the Sene|cas removed their quarters two or three times, in a few years&mdash;it being a practice among the natives to abandon the place infected with this plague. The di&s;ea&s;e was confined to the Indians&mdash;the white people, living and trading with them, not being affected.</P>
<P>In 1746 the Mohegan tribe of Indians, between New-Lon|don and Norwich, was wa&s;ted by the &s;ame malady. Dr. Tracy of Norwich now decea&s;ed, was the only white man affected&mdash;he attended them as their phy&s;ician. From Mr. Philemon Tracy, a &s;on of the doctor, who has taken the trouble to examin a Mo|hegan prie&s;t, a man of good &s;en&s;e and integrity, who was him|&s;elf affected by the di&s;order, I have the following account of this pe&s;tilence.&mdash;That it appeared in Augu&s;t and prevailed till cold weather&mdash;that about one hundred of the tribe peri&s;hed&mdash; that it was the year after the reduction of Cape Breton (of cour&s;e
<PB N="342" REF="036687_0346_100AA31E69FAF6A8">
in 1746&mdash;and Dr. Tracy's books confirm the dates mentioned by the Indian)&mdash;that the patient fir&s;t complained of a &s;evere pain in the head and back, which was followed by fever&mdash;in three or four days, the &s;kin turned as yellow as gold, a vomiting of black matter took place and generally a bleeding at the no&s;e and mouth, which continued, till the patient died. The&s;e are the words of the old Indian, as penned at the time by my in|formant.</P>
<P>It will be remarked that this was a local pe&s;tilence, the fever being confined to a &s;ingle tribe of Indians and not prevailing in the neighboring towns. But it will be remarked al&s;o that this was the &s;ame year, it prevailed in Albany, when the bills of mortality were generally high.</P>
<P>I have a&s;certained that the canker-worm, which lately ravaged the fruit trees in New-England, appeared as early as 1788 or 1789.</P>
<P>A fatal malignant di&s;ea&s;e raged among the tribes of the Mo|hawk Indians, about the year 1776, and reduced &s;ome of them to a few men.</P>
<P>From Dr. Wheeler of Redhook, on the Hud&s;on, I learn that the angina &s;carlatina appeared there in January 1789 and prevailed till April&mdash;it prevailed al&s;o in the two &s;ucceeding win|ters.</P>
<P>The influenza, in that year, fir&s;t appeared there about the middle of October, and prevailed two months, among all ages and both &s;exes. Catarrhal coughs have been prevalent every year, &s;ince that time. In the &s;pring of 1793, angina &s;carlatina, mumps and catarrhal coughs prevailed till June, and di&s;appeared. Soon after commenced the remitting fever. In &s;ome ca&s;es the paroxy&s;ms invaded the patient in the form of madne&s;s.</P>
<P>The reader will note that in our interior country, the remit|ting fever of that di&s;tingui&s;hed year, 1793, had nearly the &s;ame &s;pring precur&s;ors, as the yellow fever in Philadelphia.</P>
<P>The mea&s;les at Redhook in 1795, partook of the character of the preceding epidemic fevers; beginning with a highly in|flammatory diathe&s;is, and &s;ometimes ending in typhus, with pe|techiae, vibices and hemorrhagy. Pleuri&s;ies had the &s;ame char|acter.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="036687_0347_100AA35855D0A3F8">At Brattleborough, on the Connecticut, a family by the name of Morgan were &s;eized in 1791 with a fever of the typhus kind, and &s;ix of them died. Several per&s;ons who vi&s;ited the family took the di&s;ea&s;e and died, and there its progre&s;s ended. The family re&s;ides in a healthy &s;ituation, near a &s;mall active &s;tream of water; and no vi&s;ible cau&s;e could be a&s;&s;igned for the origin of this di&s;temper. The&s;e facts are taken from Dr. Hall of that town. It will be remembered that this was the year when au|tumnal di&s;ea&s;es fir&s;t put on the malignant a&s;pect of our late pe&s;ti|lence, when the plague broke out in Egypt and the yellow fever in the We&s;t-Indies began to a&s;&s;ume what Dr. Chi&s;holm calls unu&s;ual &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>Dr. Center of Newport informs me that in 1798 occurred in that place many ca&s;es of a bilious fever bearing &s;ome re&s;emblance to the infectious fever; and one ca&s;e of decided carbuncular and glandular plague, in a man of robu&s;t con&s;titution. There is no pretence of foreign origin, in any of tho&s;e ca&s;es.</P>
<P>From &s;undry gentlemen living in Chel&s;ea, a village at the landing in Norwich, I learn that two or three ca&s;es of malig|nant bilious fever occurred there in 1798, marked with the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of the infectious fever. Some of the&s;e ca&s;es could not po&s;&s;ibly have been derived from infection. One of the pa|tients might have contracted his di&s;ea&s;e at New-London.</P>
<P>Dr. Holyoke of Salem, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, informs me that in 1798, many ca&s;es of malignant bilious fever occurred in that town, which could not have been derived from infection.</P>
<P>From Dr. Woodruff and Dr. M'Clellan of Albany, I learn that &s;everal ca&s;es of malignant bilious fever appeared in that city, in 1798, marked with all the &s;ymptoms of the pe&s;tilence of our cities and which mu&s;t have originated in that place. About one half who were &s;eized, died.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ca&s;e of influenza at Albany in 1789 is noted by Dr. M'Clellan to have occurred on the 30th of September. This was preci&s;ely the time of its appearance at Philadelphia, and a little after its fir&s;t appearance at New-York. In the coun|try, between New-York and Albany, it did not appear till a week or two later. The&s;e facts prove that this di&s;ea&s;e falls on di&s;tant places at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="036687_0348_100AA3200D655A10">The &s;carlatina angino&s;a appeared at Albany in the winter and &s;pring of 1793, about the time it did in New-York and Phila|delphia.</P>
<P>In every part of our country, one remark has been made by phy&s;icians, that from the year 1792 or 3, intermittents and re|mittents have become more numerous and ob&s;tinate, and attend|ed with unu&s;ual &s;ymptoms. In many places, the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es have been multiplied in a ten-fold ratio; elucidating the principles of the great Sydenham, relative to "Con&s;titutions of Air," and demon&s;trating the exi&s;tence of a general cau&s;e in the in&s;en&s;ible properties of the atmo&s;phere, to which we may and mu&s;t a&s;cribe the pe&s;tilence of our maritime towns.</P>
<P>In 1798 multitudes of dead pike were ob&s;erved to float down the Mohawk and Hud&s;on.</P>
<P>From Dr. Thatcher I learn that for &s;ome years pa&s;t, an au|tumnal fever has prevailed in Plymouth, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, of the remitting kind, with low typhus &s;ymptoms. In winter it takes the type of the nervous fever. It was very prevalent in 1798 in that and a neighboring town.</P>
<P>From Dr. Smith of Hanover, in New-Hamp&s;hire, and Drs. Green and Tra&s;k of Wind&s;or, in Vermont, I have obtained information re&s;pecting a very infectious fever which prevailed in tho&s;e towns and the vicinity in 1798. This di&s;ea&s;e is de&s;cribed by Dr. Spalding in the Medical Repo&s;itory, vol. 3. p. 5. It approaches nearly to the typhus mitior of Cullen, but the fiery red eye at the inva&s;ion &s;eems to indicate its alliance to the in|fectious fever of our cities; and it re&s;embles the di&s;ea&s;e known by the popular name of long fever.</P>
<P>This fever, in Wind&s;or and Hanover, was preceded by dy&s;|entery of uncommon malignancy in 1797, which, in Wind&s;or, was attended with an unu&s;ual inflammation of the lungs. The di&s;ea&s;e which preceded the&s;e epidemics was the &s;carlatina angino|&s;a, which was very prevalent in 1796.</P>
<P>It is worthy of notice that in all parts of our country, the au|tumnal infectious fevers have had precur&s;ors in other epidemics, e&s;pecially catarrhal complaints and anginas. I do not find an ex|ception to this remark.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="036687_0349_100AA35AB9D50208">This fever at Wind&s;or de&s;erves further to be noticed for its in|fectious or contagious quality. It was far <HI>le&s;s</HI> fatal, but <HI>more</HI> in|fectious than the yellow fever of our cities. Nur&s;es often took the di&s;ea&s;e, and when they returned to their dwellings in di&s;tant towns, rarely failed to communicate it to the whole family. This is a phenomenon rarely, perhaps never exhibited by the pe&s;tilence of our maritime towns, which has an atmo&s;phere of its own out of which it is not communicated.</P>
<P>I have examined per&s;onally the po&s;itions of many of the towns where this fever and dy&s;entery have been mo&s;t prevalent, and I find no where any mar&s;h that can rationally be &s;uppo&s;ed to originate the&s;e di&s;tempers. In general the towns are &s;ituated on a ba&s;is of clay, between high ridges of land or mountains, where the heat of the &s;un is greatly concentrated, and on the margin of rivers. To this de&s;cription, there are &s;ome exceptions as to the &s;oil; &s;ome towns being on &s;and or gravel. The neigh|borhood of fre&s;h &s;treams of water cannot be admitted as a cau&s;e of the&s;e fevers&mdash;nothing being more falubrious than &s;uch &s;treams. But I am per&s;uaded from careful ob&s;ervation, that, under a pe&s;|tilential con&s;titution of air, great heat is the immediate exciting cau&s;e of autumnal fevers, in &s;ituations not expo&s;ed to mar&s;h effluvia.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the origin of the pe&s;tilential fever in Port&s;|mouth, in 1798, the facts are as follow.</P>
<P>A laboring man, who was given to liquor, received his wages on Saturday evening. He was &s;eized with the malignant fever, and died on the next Wedne&s;day. While he lay ill, a ve&s;&s;el arrived which had lo&s;t a man or two by the fever on her voyage, but no per&s;on was ill on board, at the time of her arrival. Some of the per&s;ons who afterwards died of the fever, had been on board of that ve&s;&s;el; but whether they took the di&s;ea&s;e from in|fection or not, cannot be known. The fir&s;t ca&s;e occurred <HI>before</HI> the arrival. This is an agreed point. I have the&s;e facts from two of the principal gentlemen of that town, one of them a re&s;pecta|ble phy&s;ician; the other, the per&s;on who paid the wages to the man who fir&s;t died. All my enquiries have been made at the &s;ources of correct information; and I find every where <HI>popular reports</HI> are fal&s;e or incorrect. Yet popular reports are received as truth by many phy&s;icians and writers, and are made the ba&s;is of fal&s;e and pernicious theories, both in America and Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="036687_0350_100AA35CB9676770">The fever in Port&s;mouth was limited in its progre&s;s to the northern part of the town. In the &s;outhern part, at the &s;ame time, prevailed a malignant dy&s;entery, which was as mortal as the fever in the northern part. The line of divi&s;ion was drawn by a wide &s;treet or &s;quare on which &s;tands the court-hou&s;e. The &s;car|let fever had been prevalent in the town for two years preceding.</P>
<P>In 1799, the pre&s;ent &s;ummer, many per&s;ons have taken the pe&s;tilential fever from ve&s;&s;els arrived from the We&s;t-Indies; but in mo&s;t, or all ca&s;es, the fever has become extinct, without any con&s;iderable mortality. In Bo&s;ton, the mortality was limited to two or three per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e at Newburyport was &s;ingular. A ve&s;&s;el went and returned from the We&s;t-Indies, without a ca&s;e of malignant fever; but as &s;he arrived at the mouth of the river Merrimack, 18 days from St. Thomas's, a boy was &s;eized with the fever, and afterwards one or two others Several per&s;ons took the di&s;ea&s;e and died; but people left the vicinity, and the di&s;order be|came extinct. This was a fever generated on board of the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The beginning of the &s;ummer of 1799, tho late, was favor|able to vegeta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion, and the fir&s;t crops were good. Wheat, which had been bla&s;ted, for &s;everal preceding years, in the ea&s;t|ern &s;tates, was excellent.</P>
<P>But in July commenced a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing drouth, in all the northern &s;tates; and particularly in the middle &s;tates, and the interior country; by which the maize, buck-wheat and potatoes were greatly injured. In &s;ome parts of the &s;tate of New-York, the maize was totally de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Over the ea&s;tern &s;tates, a &s;pecies of caterpillar of &s;mall &s;ize appeared in unparalleled numbers, covering the wild cherry-tree, the apple, the willow, the a&s;h, and the hickory. In &s;ome parts, a large caterpillar, with variegated colors, &s;tripped the black oak of all its leaves. Gra&s;s-hoppers were as numerous as the blades of gra&s;s, and in &s;ome places, injured greatly the gra&s;s and other vegetables. But e&s;pecially to be noted were the &s;mall toads of the color de&s;cribed by Fernelius, "Coloris cineritii" like a&s;hes; of the &s;ize of a filbert, and in numbers not to be e&s;timated. The&s;e were numerous al&s;o in 1798. They an&s;wer the de&s;crip|tion of tho&s;e which medical writers of former ages ob&s;erved to be the forerunners and companions of pe&s;tilence. At what time
<PB N="347" REF="036687_0351_100AA35FCEF2C070">
they appeared and di&s;appeared, is not exactly known&mdash;they were mo&s;t generally ob&s;erved in July.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring prevailed influenza or catarrhal fevers; in &s;ome places cynanche maligna; and generally rheumatic complaints, and &s;light ulcerations of the throat. In many places, the fevers of winter were characterized with a yellow &s;kin and bilious di&s;|charges. All the&s;e marked the continuance of a pe&s;tilential atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>The plague &s;howed it&s;elf early, in &s;cattered ca&s;es, in Phila|delphia; but di&s;appeared, to the un&s;peakable joy of the inhabit|ants. Alas! When &s;uch ca&s;es appear in July, and e&s;pecially if other di&s;ea&s;es in winter and &s;pring manife&s;t &s;ymptoms of the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|vailing epidemic, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible that our cities &s;hould e&s;cape a pe&s;tilential fever in autumn. This terrible &s;courge renewed its ravages in Philadelphia and New-York; and in various parts of our country, bilious fevers appeared with malignant &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>At Hartford, on the Connecticut, appeared the malignant fever in Augu&s;t, to the &s;urpri&s;e of the inhabitants and of the &s;tate. People who have no ju&s;t ideas of the nature and origin of this di&s;ea&s;e, attempted to find the cau&s;e in &s;ome ve&s;&s;el from the We&s;t-Indies; but being di&s;appointed, re&s;orted to a &s;mall coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;el. On examination it appears, that this ve&s;&s;el was u&s;ed as a market boat between Connecticut river and New-York &mdash;the ma&s;ter had died in June, but of what di&s;ea&s;e, I am not able to learn. Another ma&s;ter took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her, and find|ing her very dirty, with the remains of various vegetables, he overhauled her and gave her a thorough clean&s;ing. He took in at New-York a cargo of &s;alt, and &s;ailed to New-Haven, where the ve&s;&s;el lay &s;ome time, about the middle of July. Here the &s;alt was purcha&s;ed by a merchant of Hartford, and the ve&s;&s;el ordered round to that place, where &s;he arrived and di&s;charged her cargo, in the beginning of Augu&s;t. From the time the ve&s;|&s;el left New-York, to the time of di&s;charging the &s;alt, mu&s;t have been from four to &s;ix weeks. After leaving Hartford, and go|ing down the river, the ma&s;ter and mate of this ve&s;&s;el were &s;ei|zed with the fever and died. In&s;tead therefore of being <HI>im|ported,</HI> the fever was <HI>exported.</HI></P>
<P>Some attempts were made to trace all the fir&s;t ca&s;es of the fever to that ve&s;&s;el; but it does not appear that more than one
<PB N="348" REF="036687_0352_100AA3620A75A878">
per&s;on who had the di&s;ea&s;e, was ever on board; and it is <HI>proved</HI> that mo&s;t of the per&s;ons affected were never near that ve&s;&s;el and never vi&s;ited the &s;ick. It is proved further th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en or twelve per&s;ons employed in unloading the ve&s;&s;el, not one was ever af|fected by the malady. Yet even in this ca&s;e, the &s;illy tale of importation is &s;wallowed with eagerne&s;s by the advocates of that doctrin.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s my&s;elf weary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d a&s;hamed of refuting &s;uch gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd|le&s;s opinions and &s;urmi&s;es; but it is a ta&s;k which truth and ju&s;|tice and public happine&s;s demand. The truth is, the &s;pot where this fever aro&s;e, is low ground, retaining water to &s;tagnate after the &s;pring floods&mdash;built upon in a crouded irregular manner&mdash; extremely filthy&mdash;penetrated by a creek which has been dried and neglected, and become the re&s;ervoir of every unclean thing &mdash;in the vicinity is a &s;laughter-hou&s;e, where loads of garbage contribute to render the air foul and noxious. Let any man walk over the ground and examin it with care, as I have done &s;ince the fever, and he will be convinced that no imported fomes was nece&s;&s;ary, in that place, to breed a pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>But one of the &s;tronge&s;t arguments to prove the dome&s;tic ori|gin of the malady, is, what people rarely con&s;ider. Numerous fevers of the remitting kind, and typhus mitior, have originated on the &s;ame ground, for &s;everal years pa&s;t; and in 1798, two ca&s;es of malignant yellow fever&mdash;one of which terminated in three days. The&s;e fevers marked the predominant &s;tate of that local atmo&s;phere, and decide the que&s;tion of dome&s;tic origin.</P>
<P>On the 15th of July a tremendous hail &s;torm pa&s;&s;ed over Con|necticut from the we&s;tward, attended with violent wind and thunder. The &s;tones and pieces of ice were of various &s;izes, from that of a walnut to that of a hen's egg. In Go&s;hen, Corn|wall&punc; New-Hartford, &amp;c. on the we&s;t, and Lebanon, Franklin, &amp;c. on the ea&s;t of the Connecticut, the gra&s;s, corn and every green thing was injured or de&s;troyed; gla&s;s was broken, trees galled, and &s;mall animals killed. The champain country on the Connecticut was le&s;s injured. This &s;torm, unexampled in Con|necticut, re&s;embles numberle&s;s hail &s;torms de&s;cribed in hi&s;tory, as the precur&s;ors and companions of pe&s;tilence.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IX. Bills of mortality for the two la&s;t centuries, with the principal phenomena of the elements.</HEAD>
<P>OUR accounts of di&s;ea&s;es and the phenomena of the world, which appear to be connected with them, are altogether imperfect. But in the two la&s;t centuries, we have a tolerable hi&s;tory of di&s;|ea&s;es, and occa&s;ionally an account of the &s;ea&s;ons, and remarka|ble occurrences. In the following tables, the reader will find the bills of mortality for London, Aug&s;burg, Dre&s;den, Bo&s;ton, one Church in Philadelphia, with a few bills of Paris and Dub|lin; to which are prefixed &s;uch of the remarkable phenomena of the elements, as I have been able to collect. As winter makes a part of two years, the word <HI>&s;evere</HI> is &s;et again&s;t the year which preceded the winter. Thus again&s;t the year 1607, the word <HI>&s;evere</HI> refers to the winter of 1607-8. The blanks denote, ei|ther that nothing &s;ingular occurred in tho&s;e years, or that I have no account of the occurrences. Further enquiries might proba|bly enable me to fill many of tho&s;e blanks.</P>
<P>Bills of mortality do not exhibit a complete view of epidemics; as &s;ome of the more remarkable, e&s;pecially <HI>influenza,</HI> de&s;troy but few lives, and the bills of the years when that di&s;ea&s;e alone prevailed, are remarkably low. It is often the immediate pre|cur&s;or of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es in autumn; in which ca&s;es, the bills of the year are very high.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION X. Remarks on the preceding Hi&s;tory and Tables.</HEAD>
<P>IMPERFECT as ancient hi&s;tory is, in regard to the accounts of di&s;ea&s;es, and the extraordinary phenomena of nature, we find that between the year B. C. 480 and the Chri&s;tian era, a num|ber of violent plagues occurred, mo&s;t of which coincided in time with the following phenomena, comets, eruptions of vol|canoes, earthquakes, drouth, &s;evere winters, di&s;ea&s;es among cattle. Of thirteen comets mentioned in the foregoing hi&s;tory, which are all who&s;e dates I am able to a&s;certain, <HI>eight</HI> of them coincide with volcanic eruptions of Etna, the only volcano of any note, which the hi&s;tory of that period has recorded; and <HI>ele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> of them coincide in time with pe&s;tilence. If we con|&s;ider the &s;carcity of our materials for a hi&s;tory of the&s;e phenomena, at that period, and make due allowances for the uncertainty of chronology, we &s;hall find rea&s;on to be &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;uch a number of the&s;e coincidences. In &s;everal in&s;tances we find extreme drouth and very &s;evere winters to corre&s;pond in time with comets and eruptions of Etna, conformable to facts in modern days.</P>
<P>On this &s;ubject, hi&s;tory is barren al&s;o for many centuries after the Chri&s;tian era. Yet in every period, even in the dark ages, we find numerous coincidences of the great phenomena above mentioned. All the great plagues that have afflicted mankind, have been accompanied with violent agitations of the elements.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Modern philo&s;ophy objects to the popular &s;en&s;e in which the word, <HI>elements,</HI> is u&s;ed; &s;ince it appears that what has u&s;ually been con&s;idered as an <HI>element,</HI> is found by modern chymi&s;try to be a com|pound &s;ub&s;tance, re&s;olvable into parts, in their nature and properties, di&s;tinct. Notwith&s;tanding th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e di&s;coveries, I cannot con&s;ent to di&s;card the popular u&s;e of the word <HI>element.</HI> Nature pre&s;ents to the &s;en&s;es of man, fire, earth, air and water, in a particular and predominant form. This is the form in which they appear to be mo&s;t u&s;eful to man, and to be the con&s;tituent materials of other &s;ub&s;tances, as well as the agents in carrying on the great vi&s;ible operations of the &s;y&s;tem. I therefore con&s;ider the popular di&s;tribution as natural and convenient.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="036687_0366_100AA3801A2A9008">This ob&s;ervation re&s;ts particularly on the events that preceded and attended the pe&s;tilences of the following periods. A. D. 80&mdash;167&mdash;252&mdash;375&mdash;400&mdash;445&mdash;542&mdash;558&mdash;590&mdash;639&mdash; 679&mdash;682&mdash;745&mdash;762&mdash;802&mdash;905&mdash;994&mdash;1005&mdash;1031&mdash; 1044&mdash;1069&mdash;1106&mdash;1135&mdash;1142&mdash;1162&mdash;1181&mdash;1222&mdash; 1242&mdash;1300&mdash;1347&mdash;1368&mdash;1400&mdash;1477&mdash;1500&mdash;1531&mdash; 1577&mdash;1602&mdash;1625&mdash;1636&mdash;1665&mdash;1699&mdash;1709&mdash;1719&mdash; 1728&mdash;1743&mdash;1751&mdash;1760&mdash;1770&mdash;1783&mdash;1789. Many facts in other periods concur to prove the truth of the remark.</P>
<P>The phenomenon mo&s;t generally and clo&s;ely connected with pe&s;tilence is an earthquake. From all the facts that I can find in hi&s;tory, I que&s;tion whether an in&s;tance of a con&s;iderable plague in any country, can be mentioned, which has not been immediately preceded or accompanied with convul&s;ions of the earth. If any exceptions have occurred, they have e&s;caped my re&s;earches. It does not happen that <HI>every place</HI> where pe&s;tilence prevails, is &s;haken; but during the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;es which I denominate <HI>pe&s;tilence,</HI> and which run, in certain periods, over large portions of the globe, &s;ome parts of the earth, and e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e which abound mo&s;t with &s;ubterranean fire, are vio|lently agitated.</P>
<P>By adverting to the foregoing hi&s;tory, the reader will find that all tho&s;e years, in which con&s;iderable earthquakes have oc|curred in America, have been remarkably &s;ickly. The&s;e years are 1638, 1647, 1658, 1662 and 3, 1668, 1727, 1755, 1783. See the hi&s;tory and the bills of mortality. Even the &s;lighter &s;hocks, have been attended with con&s;iderable &s;ickne&s;s, or have introduced a &s;eries of epidemics, being cotemporary with the mea&s;les, influenza or &s;ore throat; as in 1669, 1720, 1737, 1757, 1761, 1769, 1771, 1791, 1797.</P>
<P>To enumerate the in&s;tances in Europe and A&s;ia, would be a u&s;ele&s;s repetition of the events related in the preceding hi&s;tory, to which the reader is referred.</P>
<P>Another phenomenon, which, next to earthquakes, appears
<PB N="12" REF="036687_0367_100AA381A1932B48">
to be mo&s;t clo&s;ely connected with epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, is the erup|tion of fire from volcanic mountains. In this article, hi&s;tory is deficient, or I have not been fortunate enough to find the works nece&s;&s;ary to furni&s;h a complete view of the&s;e phenomena. There are whole centuries in which the books I have con&s;ulted, men|tion no eruption of Etna and Ve&s;uvius. The account of erup|tions in Iceland, from the year 1000, taken from Pennant's Arctic Zoology, vol. 1. 331, is probably complete, or nearly &s;o. Of the volcanoes in the Andes, we have very few accounts; as well as of tho&s;e in the Moluccas. Of tho&s;e in the Arctic regions of A&s;ia and America, we know very little.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e defects, we are able, by the eruptions in Italy, Sicily and Iceland, to arrive to &s;ome very important conclu&s;ions. The reader mu&s;t have noticed, in the preceding hi&s;tory, the coincidences in time between volcanic di&s;charges, and winters of unu&s;ual &s;everity. The&s;e di&s;charges either precede or follow the winter. Thus the eruptions of 1766, 1779 and 1783, were immediately followed by inten&s;ely cold winters. The &s;evere winters of 1762-3 and 1779-80, were &s;peedily fol|lowed by eruptions. The&s;e in&s;tances will &s;erve as &s;amples of the ordinary cour&s;e of the&s;e events. Sometimes the eruptions continue or are repeated, for a number of years in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but the eruptions when continued are moderate and the &s;ea&s;ons variable. When the volcanoes have been, for &s;ome years, quiet, and that &s;u&s;pen&s;ion is followed by a great di&s;charge, it appears to me that &s;evere winters invariably follow or precede the di&s;|charge, within a few months. So al&s;o when an eruption is con|tinued for a number of years, if at any time the di&s;charge be|comes violent, a &s;evere winter attends it; as in 1669. Etna was in a &s;tate of eruption from 1664 to 1679; but in 1669, the di&s;charge was immen&s;ely augmented, and the winters next preceding and following, were very &s;evere.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome years in which eruptions are noted, of which I find no account, re&s;pecting the &s;ea&s;ons. Perhaps &s;ome of the&s;e will, on further inve&s;tigation, be found to be exceptions.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that, in &s;ome ca&s;es, a &s;evere winter ex|tends to both hemi&s;pheres, &s;ometimes to one only, and in a few
<PB N="13" REF="036687_0368_100AA384E63F36C8">
ca&s;es, to a part of a hemi&s;phere only. Thus in 1607-8&mdash;1683-4 &mdash;1762<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">3&mdash;1766-7&mdash;1779-80&mdash;1783-4, the &s;everity extended to both hemi&s;pheres. In 1640-41&mdash;1739-40, and in other in|&s;tances, the &s;evere winter in Europe preceded, by one year, a &s;imilar winter in America. In a few in&s;tances, &s;evere fro&s;t takes place in one hemi&s;phere, during a &s;eries of mild winters in the other; but this is le&s;s common. In general, the &s;everity hap|pens, in both hemi&s;pheres at once, or in two winters in imme|diate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and as far as evidence has yet appeared, this &s;e|verity is clo&s;ely attendant on volcanic di&s;charges, with very few exceptions.</P>
<P>Another phenomenon which u&s;ually coincides in time with &s;e|vere winters, is the approach of comets. I have been &s;truck with &s;urpri&s;e at the coincidences of this kind. There are a few in&s;tances on record of mild winters, during the appearance of the&s;e bodies; but in the&s;e ca&s;es, the comets have appeared to be &s;mall, or to pa&s;s the &s;y&s;tem at an immen&s;e di&s;tance from the earth. The large comets and tho&s;e which approach near to the earth, <HI>&s;eem</HI> to produce almo&s;t uniformly great heat, exce&s;&s;ive drouth, followed by very cold winters, tremendous &s;torms of wind, rain, &s;now and hail, unu&s;ual tides or &s;well of the ocean, and u&s;ually, volcanic eruptions. How far the&s;e phenomena are connected, as cau&s;e and effect, future ob&s;ervations may de|termin. Some of them occur &s;o uniformly in the &s;ame year, that I cannot re&s;i&s;t the evidence of their connection.</P>
<P>After a volcano has been many years quiet, its di&s;charges are, I believe, always preceded by extreme drouth; and this defect of water is not only ob&s;ervable in the vicinity of the volcano, but often extends over a whole continent, if not over the world. Many in&s;tances have been related; it is &s;ufficient here to men|tion the exce&s;&s;ive drouth in 1762 and 1782, preceding eruptions of Etna and Heckla. In the&s;e years, almo&s;t all &s;prings were exhau&s;ted over a great portion of America.</P>
<P>Cold winters &s;ometimes follow wet &s;ea&s;ons, but more gene|rally a very hot &s;ummer or very dry autumn. Sometimes two or three &s;evere winters occur in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as in 1766, 67 and 68 &mdash;and in America from 1796 to 1799.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="036687_0369_100AA387EBC26098">The years when comets approach, or volcanoes di&s;charge fire, and when the atmo&s;phere exhibits fiery appearances, as meteors, &s;treams of light, and mock &s;uns, are, beyond compari&s;on, the mo&s;t tempe&s;tuous. Witne&s;s the years 1766, 1771 and 72, 1780, 1783, 4 and 5, 1788, 1797. In &s;uch years, the ri&s;k on ve&s;|&s;els at &s;ea, is greatly increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>As dry &s;ea&s;ons u&s;ually precede volcanic eruptions, &s;o very wet &s;ea&s;ons often follow them. This &s;eems not to be the inva|riable cour&s;e of events; but there are remarkable in&s;tances of deluging rains after the&s;e di&s;charges. Witne&s;s the &s;ea&s;ons follow|ing the univer&s;al convul&s;ions of the earth in 1692 and 3, and 1766. Thus, the electricity is re-conducted to the earth.</P>
<P>In every ca&s;e, I believe this remark will be found t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; that the approach of comets, and volcanic eruptions di&s;tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the regu|lar cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;ons. The heat of &s;ummer and the cold of winter are in extremes; more &s;now is generated in winter, and more hail in &s;ummer; tempe&s;ts are more violent and frequent; meteors more numerous, and rain more unequally di&s;tributed over the earth.</P>
<P>A &s;eries of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, mea&s;les, influenza, affections of the throat, followed by pe&s;tilential fevers, appear generally to commence and take their departure, from &s;ome of the great agi|tations of the elements above recited. This at lea&s;t has been the ca&s;e in America in the four la&s;t periods, beginning with 1756-7, 1769 and 70, 1782 and 3, 1788 and 9. This fact will want no authority but a bare in&s;pection of the preceding hi&s;tory, and tables.</P>
<P>The continuance and the varieties of the di&s;ea&s;es &s;eem to de|pend on &s;imilar di&s;turbances in the elements; and as the di&s;|charges and motions of the electrical fluid depend on no certain laws that are known, they are irregular, and may contribute to vary the order, and the nature of di&s;ea&s;es. In &s;ome ca&s;es, there has been a continued &s;eries of epidemics, for twenty years, in which the common order is not exactly ob&s;erved; but this is not frequent. A remarkable in&s;tance occurred between 1727 and 1744.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e periods in general have been mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for
<PB N="15" REF="036687_0370_100AA38972C8FDE8">
&s;ickne&s;s over the world, in which the fire of the earth has exhib|ited the mo&s;t numerous and violent effects. Witne&s;s the period from 1631 to 1637, when the three mo&s;t noted volcanoes di&s;|charged immen&s;e quantities of fire and lava; and &s;evere pe&s;ti|lence extended over all Europe and America. A &s;imilar re|mark may be made concerning the period of the la&s;t univer&s;al pe&s;tilence in Europe from 1663 to 1666&mdash;al&s;o from 1691 to 1695&mdash;from 1727 to 30&mdash;1759 to 1764&mdash;1769 to 1772&mdash;1774 to 1777&mdash;1783 to 1786&mdash;and concerning &s;ome &s;horter periods, all of which produced epidemics in both hemi&s;pheres.</P>
<P>Slighter eruptions and earthquakes, which are almo&s;t annual, &s;eem to have le&s;s effect. The fire of the globe is in perpetual motion or action, and to this great agent, philo&s;ophers are agreed, are to be a&s;cribed the changes of &s;ea&s;ons, and the generation of rain, hail and &s;now. Its operations however are not all of them vi&s;ible, nor even perceptible, until they appear by their effects. It is probable that the <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> operations of the electrical fluid produce more effects than tho&s;e which are &s;een. Indeed, we may que&s;tion whether mo&s;t of the vi&s;ible phenomena of that principle, are not mere <HI>effects</HI> of that action which influences the vegetable and animal world. It is probable to me that neither &s;ea&s;ons, earthquakes, nor volcanic eruptions, are the cau&s;es of the principal derangements we behold in animal and vegetable life, but are them&s;elves the <HI>effects</HI> of tho&s;e motions and invi&s;ible operations which affect mankind. Hence catarrh and other epi|demics often appear, <HI>before</HI> the vi&s;ible phenomena of eruptions and earthquakes.</P>
<P>P. S. After this work was prepared for the pre&s;s, I was fa|vored by Dr. Mitchill, with &s;ome extracts from a paper of Mr. Holm, a Swede, on the &s;ubject of a volcanic eruption in Ice|land, in 1783, by which it appears that the atmo&s;phere is ren|dered pe&s;tilential by di&s;charges of fire and lava from the earth. This effect is &s;uppo&s;ed to be wrought by a combination of the &s;eptous and oxygenous parts, and may confirm and improve Dr. Mitchill's theory of pe&s;tilential air.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="036687_0371_100AA38AF956F098">This eruption I under&s;tand to have been a bur&s;ting of fire from the earth, in a place di&s;tant from Heckla. In the neighbor|hood of the column of flame were generated &s;now, hail and ex|treme cold. The water that fell in rain was acid and corro&s;ive; de&s;troying cattle and men&mdash;covering the bodies of cattle with pu&s;tles and ulcers, and excoriating th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hands and faces of men when it fell on them. It al&s;o killed vegetables. The effects were felt not only in Iceland, but in Norway, and other parts of Europe.</P>
<P>Had this treati&s;e fallen into my hands &s;ome months ago, I might have been able to illu&s;trate particular parts of my theory by authentic facts, taken from that work. As it is, I mu&s;t content my&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that Mr. Holm's ob&s;ervations verify my ideas, re&s;pecting the agency of electricity in producing pe&s;tilence, and extremes in the &s;ea&s;ons. On this theory not only pe&s;tilence, but &s;evere cold, and extreme heat, hail and &s;now are all familiar|ly explained, and their connection with volcanic eruptions, and other electrical operations, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible, demon&s;trated.</P>

<P>It is probable the mortality in the northern &s;tates of America was every where in that proportion. The &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e made &s;imilar ravages between 1749 and 1753&mdash;in 1759&mdash;1765 and 6 &mdash;in &s;ome places in 1769.&mdash;It was remarkably mortal in 1773. This latter year was in America unhealthy. In Salem, Ma&s;&s;. the bill of 1773, was rai&s;ed to 208, (double the u&s;ual amount) by the dy&s;entery. The bill for St. Peter&s;burgh in Ru&s;&s;ia, was &s;wel|led in 1773, one fifth, and in 1777, one fourth.</P>
<P>The la&s;t epidemic period, &s;ave one, was from 1781 to 1787 inclu&s;ive. The di&s;ea&s;es were influenza, mea&s;les and &s;carlatina. The&s;e were in general lighter than u&s;ual. In the interior of New-York &s;tate, Vermont Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire, the &s;carlatina was more &s;evere and mortal; but on the &s;ea board and e&s;pecially in Connecticut, it was milder, and many places wholly e&s;caped it. Yet every where the bills of mortality were &s;welled in 1783, 4, 5 or 6, when the plague was raging in the Levant and Egypt. This period was clo&s;ed by remarkably cool &s;ummers, and no dy&s;entery or pe&s;tilential fever of any con&s;iderable violence or extent, &s;ucceeded.</P>

<P>Let it be noted that the effect of the &s;carlatina was here in 1795 and '96. The progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e is di&s;tinctly marked to be from New-York ea&s;tward, from 1793 to 1796. The &s;carlatina in 1785 and 6, was mo&s;t &s;evere in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts&mdash;that in 1794, in Connecticut. The bills in Bo&s;ton for 1792 were &s;welled by the &s;mall-pox by inoculation, which is not to be taken into this account of epidemics. The year &s;elected was rather unfavorable, as the condition of the atmo&s;phere was inflammatory, and incli|ned to produce eruptive complaints. The &s;carlatina was then making its appearance in the middle &s;tates. The &s;pring of 1793, when inoculation was begun at Hartford, was &s;till more unfa|vorable; and the &s;mall-pox was &s;o unmanageable as to &s;urpri&s;e the faculty. The principles unfolded in this treati&s;e will &s;olve the difficulty.</P>
<P>By a bill of mortality for Madeira, it appears that the pe&s;tilen|tial principle of the years from 1760 to 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> extended to that healthy i&s;land.</P>

This is true in the tropical climates, in ca&s;es of epidem|ics; and &s;o uniform has been the fact in the temperate latitudes, that I am nearly prepared to &s;ay, that if none of tho&s;e precur&s;ors appear in winter and &s;pring, no pe&s;tilential fever will be epidemic in the following &s;ummer and autumn, unle&s;s the dy&s;entery may be excepted. It holds true in every ca&s;e of <HI>great</HI> pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P N="2">2. The progre&s;&s;ivene&s;s in the pe&s;tilential principle is obvious in the augmented bills of mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ality, which immediately precede the plague. This ari&s;es from the number and violence of the ma|lignant di&s;ea&s;es which always precede an epidemic pe&s;tilence. This augmentation is vi&s;ible &s;ome times two years before the plague appears, and almo&s;t always in the &s;pring months preceding. See the London bills in the years preceding the plague in 1625 &mdash;1636&mdash;1665 The &s;ame is ob&s;ervable in other bills, both in Europe and America. In a few in&s;tances, the bill of the prece|ding year is low; but in this ca&s;e, &s;ome other epidemic has u&s;ually gone before, and fini&s;hed its cour&s;e; or the plague is preceded by influenza only, which does not &s;well the bill of mortality.</P>
<P N="3">3. Sometimes a &s;eries of epidemics falls with more violence on one hemi&s;phere than on the other; but perhaps in no in&s;tance has a cour&s;e of di&s;ea&s;es &s;pread over one continent, without &s;how|ing them&s;elves on the other. I have not been able to find an in|&s;tance in which the plague has made great ravages in the ea&s;t, ex|cept when the American continent has been more or le&s;s affected by the epidemics above mentioned; and in &s;ome in&s;tances it is proved that the violence of the &s;ore-throat, influenza, mea&s;les or
<PB N="27" REF="036687_0382_100B2C64FB5A0BC8">
yellow fever, in America, has corre&s;ponded with the violence of pe&s;tilence in Egypt and the Levant. The commencement of each period of epidemics is nearly cotemporary, in both hemi&s;|pheres.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;ometimes happens that pe&s;tilence occurs in Con&s;tantinople, Smyrna or Cairo, when it is not epidemic beyond tho&s;e cities; owing to peculiar &s;ea&s;ons and local cau&s;es. But it never &s;preads to Syria, the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, and other neighboring countries, except when epidemic di&s;ea&s;es &s;pread over the world. At lea&s;t I have not found an in&s;tance.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus the great plague in Con&s;tantinople was cotemporary with the fatal angina and dy&s;entery in America in 1751&mdash;al&s;o in 1755. Cotemporary with the mea&s;les in America in 1758 and 9, was the commencement of the exten&s;ive Levant plague of 1760. Pe&s;|tilence in Per&s;ia was cotemporary with the epidemics of 1773&mdash; In 1783 commenced plague in the ea&s;t and epidemics in America &mdash;the &s;ame in 1792 and 3. Di&s;ea&s;es of the throat in almo&s;t every in&s;tance prevail at the &s;ame time in Europe and America.</P>
<P N="4">4. In two periods within half a century, a &s;evere angina and dy&s;entery have been epidemic together and once for a &s;eries of years, as in 1751, and from 1773 to 1777. This is an excep|tion to the u&s;ual order, and other deviations &s;ometimes occur.</P>
<P N="5">5. As catarrh precedes, &s;o it follows every &s;evere epidemic pe&s;tilence, and the per&s;ons who have been affected with a pe&s;ti|lential fever in &s;ummer, are mo&s;t apt to be affected by catarrh at the commencement of cold weather.</P>
<P N="6">6. After &s;evere pe&s;tilential fevers in &s;ummer, the inflammatory fevers of winter, wear the livery of the &s;ummer fevers. They generally carry with them bilious di&s;charges, and a yellow &s;kin. They have al&s;o this remarkable character, that they &s;peedily run through the inflammatory diathe&s;is, and become typhus. They are the <HI>pe&s;tilence of winter</HI>; and &s;ometimes appear <HI>before</HI> the pe&s;|tilence of &s;ummer. This fact alone decides the que&s;tion, that pe&s;tilential fevers of &s;ummer are generated on the &s;pot where they exi&s;t; and derive their malignant and infectious quality &s;ole|ly from the &s;tate of the elements.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies of inflammatory fever has occurred in many ca&s;es during the winter months, &s;ince the year 1790. In &s;ome ca&s;es it has extingui&s;hed three four and five members of a family; as
<PB N="28" REF="036687_0383_100AA3A64536FDD0">
in Hartford and New-Haven. But it is a mo&s;t con&s;oling reflec|tion, that it is le&s;s frequent than formerly in this country. It has not been epidemic in the northern &s;tates &s;ince <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">61, as far as I can learn. Formerly it was as frightful a calamity as the yellow fever is in this age. In the foregoing hi&s;tory, many examples have been mentioned&mdash;as at Fairfield in 1698&mdash;at Waterbury in 1713&mdash;at Hartford and Duck Creek in 1720&mdash;at Farmington in 1729&mdash;at Bethlem, Hartford, Ea&s;t-Haven and New-Haven in 1761&mdash;at Holli&s;ton in 1753, &amp;c. Whether the di&s;appear|ance of this di&s;ea&s;e is owing to the clearing of the country, by which the quantity of debilitating mi&agrave;&s;mata of &s;ummer has been dimini&s;hed, or whether it is the con&s;equence of other alterations in our climate, is not ea&s;ily determined.</P>
<P>The di&s;appearance of the Long Fever, &s;o called, is another mo&s;t con&s;oling circum&s;tance. This &s;pecies of typhus fever was formerly one of the mo&s;t terrible di&s;ea&s;es of our climate. At pre&s;ent i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is a rare occurrence.</P>
<P>On the whole, we have very clear proof that the <HI>quantity of di&s;ea&s;e</HI> in this country, has been dimini&s;hed, within half a century. The yellow fever, that is, the pe&s;tilential fever of &s;ummer and autumn, was formerly as frequent and as malignant as in this age; while the inflammatory fevers of winter, and the long fever, have almo&s;t di&s;appeared as epidemics. The intermittents and remit|tents of autumn, are greatly decrea&s;ed in the northern &s;tates; and the dy&s;entery has not increa&s;ed in frequency or virulence. Anginas have never been &s;o fatal as they were between 1735 and 1743.</P>
<P>It is probable that &s;ome of the&s;e changes in the character of di&s;ea&s;es may be a&s;cribed to alterations in our climate, or modes of living&mdash;and therefore may be permanent. In &s;ome ca&s;es, im|provements in medical &s;cience and the practice of phy&s;ic may have di&s;armed di&s;ea&s;es of their terrors. But it is po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome of the changes mentioned are only revolutions in di&s;ea&s;e, occa&s;ioned by temporary cau&s;es, and that the &s;ame di&s;orders may, in future periods, recur, with the whole train of formidable &s;ymp|toms.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="036687_0384_100AA3A8AABA3B80"><HI>Note.</HI>&mdash;It has been ob&s;erved that the <HI>long fever,</HI> &s;o called, has nearly di&s;appeared from our climate. On further enquiry, it appears that this ob&s;ervation mu&s;t be re&s;tricted to the maritime &s;tates. The bilious remitting fever that prevailed in Vermont and New-Hamp&s;hire in 1798, and which has re-appeared in this &s;ummer (1799) is of that &s;pecies. See Medical Repo&s;itory, vol. 3. 5. In the <HI>interior</HI> of our country, this is a new di&s;ea&s;e; while on the &s;ea-coa&s;t it has become extinct. Shall we conclude from the&s;e facts, that the di&s;ea&s;e follows or &s;prings from a par|ticular &s;tate of cultivation? In the interior, where the di&s;ea&s;e is now prevalent, the clearing and cultivation of the country were begun about 30 years ago. On the &s;ea-coa&s;t, where the di&s;ea&s;e has di&s;appeared, the country has been &s;ettled 150 years, and is generally under cultivation.</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>The accounts of the &s;ea&s;ons are mo&s;tly from Engli&s;h writers, and refer to England, with &s;ome exceptions. In regard to heat and cold, the &s;ea&s;ons are generally uniform in mo&s;t countries, on the &s;ame continent; but not in regard to drouth and moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e forty-four in&s;tances of influenza, it may be ob&s;erved, from the preceding hi&s;tory.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="33" REF="036687_0388_100AA3B49FE44A98">1. That mo&s;t of them happened, after or during &s;evere cold, or during moi&s;t weather, and in &s;pring, winter or autumn. Some however, occurred in dry hot &s;ea&s;ons, and others in mild winters.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nineteen in&s;tances occurred in years when there was a vol|canic eruption in Italy or Iceland, and eleven others, though in different years, were within a few months of eruptions; making 30 out of the 44. Two or three others happened near the time of volcanic di&s;charges in South-America.</P>
<P N="3">3. Almo&s;t all happened in years of earthquakes, or within a few months preceding or following them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Thirty in&s;tances occurred within the year, or a few months preceding or following the appearance of comets.</P>
<P>It is further to be ob&s;erved that &s;ome of the&s;e epidemics have been limited to the American hemi&s;phere, at the di&s;tance of three, four or five years from an epidemic of the &s;ame kind in Europe. Such as tho&s;e of 1647&mdash;1655&mdash;which coincide in time with violent earthquakes in South-America.</P>
<P>In other in&s;tances this di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread over the whole globe; u&s;ually beginning in America: That is, in the in&s;tances of which I can obtain any correct information. Thus in four in&s;tances, viz. in 1698, 1757, 1761 and 1781, it &s;pread over the Ameri|can hemi&s;phere one year prior to its pervading the other hemi&s;|phere. And the univer&s;al catarrh of 1733, which encircled the globe, commenced in America two months before it appeared in Europe. The epidemic of 1782 invaded Europe from the &s;ide of A&s;ia, the year after it appeared in America. In 1788, the influenza in Europe <HI>preceded</HI> the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e in America.</P>
<P>I regret my want of materials to complete a view of this &s;ub|ject. No regular regi&s;ter has been kept in America, of the &s;ea|&s;ons, di&s;ea&s;es and phenomena, from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement, and whe|ther any notices of all the catarrhs in this country, are in exi&s;|tence, I do not know. I have found no account of any, between 1655 and 1698&mdash;nor between the latter year and 1733. One of the&s;e in&s;tances, that in 1698, came to my knowledge by acci|dent, as I have mentioned under that year, in the foregoing hi&s;|tory. From the uniform appearance of this epidemic as often as
<PB N="34" REF="036687_0389_100AA3B255B39290">
once in ten or twelve years, in other periods, we have ground to believe, it has always occurred in nearly the &s;ame periods.</P>
<P>This epidemic is evidently the effect of &s;ome in&s;en&s;ible qualities of the atmo&s;phere; as it &s;preads with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity over land and &s;ea, uncontrolled by heat or cold, drouth or moi&s;ture. From the&s;e circum&s;tances and its near coincidence in time with the violent action of fire in earthquakes and volcanoes, there is rea&s;on to conclude the di&s;ea&s;e to be the effect of &s;ome acce&s;s of &s;timulant powers to the atmo&s;phere by means of the electrical principle. No other principle in creation, which has yet come under the cognizance of the human mind, &s;eems adequate to the &s;ame effects. I do not con&s;ider earthquakes and volcanic erup|tions as the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of this epidemic, but as effects of the common cau&s;e and evidences of its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The cour&s;es of this epidemic are very various. That in 1510 proceeded from Africa to Sicily, Italy and the north of Europe. This di&s;ea&s;e could not be the effect of the eruption in Iceland; for it appeared fir&s;t in &s;outhern latitudes. If there was a volcanic di&s;charge about that time in Africa, we might be inclined to a&s;|cribe the di&s;ea&s;e to that cau&s;e; but it is more probable that it is to be a&s;cribed to an in&s;en&s;ible action of atmo&s;pheric fire,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I u&s;e this word to expre&s;s the principle manife&s;ted in electrical operations, although this is u&s;ually &s;uppo&s;ed to be a cold fu&s;ion. Of the nature of this principle, we know little. We &s;ee only its effects.</NOTE> which is more general and violent, about the time of eruptions; and which fire is probably agitated in all parts of the globe, although it produces vi&s;ible effects in explo&s;ions, in &s;ome particular places only. I think no man can que&s;tion the fact, after reading the preceding hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e of the epidemic in 1551, I am not able to a&s;cer|tain; nor that in 1557. This invaded Spain in Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;evere catarrh of 1580 began in the &s;outh of Europe, in the heat of &s;ummer, and proceeded to the north. The &s;ea&s;on in general was temperate.</P>
<P>From that year to 1708&mdash;9, I find no account of the cour&s;e of the epidemic catarrh; but that in 1708&mdash;9, began in the north of Europe and proceeded to the &s;outh.</P>
<P>The epidemic of 1729&mdash;30, proceeded from Poland and Si|le&s;ia,
<PB N="35" REF="036687_0390_100AA3B71FEC12C8">
to the we&s;t and &s;outh, and ended about the time of an explo|&s;ion from Ve&s;uvius.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al influenza of 1733, began in America in the au|tumn of 1732. It appeared in Europe in December. That of 1788 appeared in April, May, June and Augu&s;t, in different places.</P>
<P>The epidemic in America in 1789, began in the middle &s;tates, and &s;pread &s;outhward and ea&s;tward. In 1790, it began in about the &s;ame longitude, but in the interior country, and &s;pread ea&s;t|ward and &s;outhward.</P>
<P>The influenza of 1782 in Europe, came from A&s;ia. Po&s;&s;ibly it might have travelled from America, acro&s;s the Pacific to Chi|na and Kam&s;chatka; as it was epidemic in America in 1781.</P>
<P>This is all I am able to di&s;cover of the origin and direction of this &s;ingular epidemic. It is greatly to be de&s;ired, that we might learn preci&s;ely the dates of its appearance, the place, the direction of its progre&s;s, in all ca&s;es, and compare the&s;e circum&s;tances with the extraordinary agitations of the elements, which occur about the &s;ame time. But for this purpo&s;e my materials are incomplete.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, however, that the influenza is clo&s;ely allied to the mea&s;les. Sometimes the &s;ymptoms are combined in the &s;ame attack, and rarely does one di&s;ea&s;e become epidemic, except ju&s;t before or after the other. This proves their alliance: indeed I con&s;ider them as different modifications of the &s;ame epidemic.</P>
<P>Catarrh is al&s;o clo&s;ely connected with pe&s;tilential fevers, and &s;ometimes this is true of the mea&s;les. It is rare indeed that epi|demic plague and yellow fever do not begin and end in catarrhal affections&mdash;that is, catarrh precedes in &s;pring, and follows in au|tumn. Sometimes pe&s;tilence is preceded and followed by mea|&s;les and angina.</P>
<P>Every epidemic con&s;titution &s;eems to commence with mea&s;les or influenza. To the&s;e &s;ucceed angina, in &s;ome of its various forms, which are all the offspring of the &s;ame parent. Then fol|low pe&s;tilential fevers, in the form of dy&s;entery, yellow fever and plague. Whenever the epidemic con&s;titution is manife&s;ted by mea&s;les, influenza and affections of the throat, common di&s;ea&s;es,
<PB N="36" REF="036687_0391_100AA3B947883CE8">
even in places apparently healthy, become more malignant, and &s;poradic ca&s;es of pe&s;tilential fever occur in almo&s;t every &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts are curious, and without attending to them, the philo&s;ophy of epidemics cannot be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>P. S. After writing the foregoing hi&s;tory, I was able to a&s;cer|tain further particulars of a &s;evere influenza in America in 1737. Warren, on the yellow fever, mentions this catarrh in Barbadoes in the winter preceding the bilious plague in that i&s;land in 1738. I have now learnt from two elderly gentlemen, who were then arrived to adult years, that in November 1737, this epidemic in|vaded all parts of the country, &s;o &s;uddenly and &s;everely that neighbors could not vi&s;it each other, and that there were &s;carce|ly people in health to perform the ordinary dome&s;tic labors nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;upport life.</P>
<P>If my informants are correct as to the time, this epidemic inva|ded Europe and America in the <HI>&s;ame month</HI>&mdash;the only in&s;tance that I have found; and an exception to the foregoing remarks. It will be ob&s;erved al&s;o that this in&s;tance coincides with an erup|tion of Ve&s;uvius, and the mo&s;t tremendous tempe&s;t in the Ea&s;t-Indies ever known. Let it be noted al&s;o, that this catarrh was the <HI>immediate precur&s;or</HI> of the mo&s;t fatal pe&s;tilential fever in the We&s;t-Indies, and one that nearly depopulated Mexico. The catarrh commenced with or a little before a mo&s;t &s;evere winter.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that the extent and violence of this di&s;tem|per mark exactly the &s;everity of the pe&s;tilential fevers which pre|cede and follow it. The two epidemic catarrhs of 1733 and 37, invaded the whole globe in the &s;ame year. They were very &s;evere, and &s;o were the anginas and plagues of this period; far beyond what has occurred at any other time, during this centu|ry, until the la&s;t period.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIII. Of the order, connection and progre&s;&s;ion of pe&s;tilential epidemics.</HEAD>
<P>IN the early periods of the world, little notice appears to have been taken of a connection between epidemic di&s;ea&s;es; nor have modern writers &s;upplied this defect in the hi&s;tory of medicin. Hippocrates and Sydenham &s;eem to have been aware of &s;uch a connection, and the latter author has laid broad and firm foun|dation for a complete &s;y&s;tem of truth, on the &s;ubject of epidem|ics. His ob&s;ervations were confined to the city of London. Had he extended his view to all parts of Europe, and general|ized his ob&s;ervations, he would have found a multitude of facts to ju&s;tify his theory, and probably would have rai&s;ed it above the reach of that obloquy and ridicule, which &s;ucceeding profe&s;&s;ors of phy&s;ic, of le&s;s genius and learning, have c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t on his occult qualities of air.</P>
<P>Indeed, it is &s;urpri&s;ing that medical men have not pur&s;ued the ideas &s;ugge&s;ted by the&s;e great fathers of their &s;cience. Hippo|crates led the way, unlocking the great doctrin of a con&s;titution or &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, calculated to produce particular epi|demic di&s;ea&s;es; a doctrin which Sydenham has pur&s;ued with wonderful &s;ucce&s;s. Any man who reads the hi&s;tory of di&s;ea&s;es, mu&s;t &s;ee that certain &s;pecies of them appear nearly together in time and place. The order in which they appear, may not be exactly the &s;ame at all times, and in all countries; but they oc|cur &s;o nearly together, as evidently to prove their alliance, and their dependence on the &s;ame general cau&s;es.</P>
<P>All popular di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t have, for their cau&s;es, &s;ome princi|ples as exten&s;ive as the effects. The&s;e cau&s;es mo&s;t probably exi&s;t in the elements, fire, air and water; for we know of no other medium by which di&s;ea&s;es can be communicated to whole com|munities of people&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="036687_0393_100AA3BE16D17DE0">Bad food indeed is a fruitful &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;es; but this mu&s;t always proceed from the qualities of the elements which enter into its compo&s;ition. A defect therefore in the nouri&s;hing powers of food, is a con&s;equence of a defect or &s;uperabundance in the elements, or in their combination in animal and vegetable produc|tions. It may be con&s;idered as a di&s;ea&s;e in the animal and veg|etable kingdom, which mo&s;t probably proceeds from the &s;ame cau&s;es, as epidemic di&s;tempers among mankind.</P>
<P>The principal epidemic di&s;tempers which invade mankind, are, catarrh or influenza, mea&s;les, whooping or chin cough, the dif|ferent &s;pecies of angina, &s;mall pox, bilious fevers, petechial fe|ver, dy&s;entery, plague. Of the&s;e, catarrh is the mo&s;t decided|ly an epidemic dependent wholly on a particular &s;tate of atmo&s;|phere. Cullen calls it "catarrh from contagion," to di&s;tingui&s;h it from &s;poradic ca&s;es of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e; but, after careful ob|&s;ervation, during the progre&s;s of it in the United States in 1789, and again in 1790, I am confident the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e de|pends very little on a communication from per&s;on to per&s;on. It has been doubted whether it is an infectious di&s;ea&s;e; and I have &s;ome evidence to prove it not &s;o; but certain it is, that its &s;ud|den inva&s;ion of whole families, whole towns and even whole countries, and the rapidity of its progre&s;s over &s;ea and land, ab|&s;olutely preclude the &s;uppo&s;ition of its dependence on &s;pecific contagion.</P>
<P>The other di&s;ea&s;es above enumerated may ari&s;e from both cau|&s;es&mdash;infection and a peculiar &s;tate of air. Some of them de|pend mo&s;tly on a con&s;titution of air, fitted to produce them; others are &s;eldom produced without a connection with di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons. It is however proper to ob&s;erve that the &s;mall-pox, dy&s;|entery and plague are not u&s;ually, and in &s;trictne&s;s of language, <HI>epidemic</HI> di&s;ea&s;es. They &s;eldom invade whole countries. They are more properly <HI>endemic;</HI> yet this epithet is not &s;trictly appli|cable to them; being u&s;ed more properly to denote a di&s;ea&s;e which is <HI>peculiar</HI> to a particular place, whereas tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es may invade any place on the globe. The elephantio&s;is is an <HI>endemic</HI> in Egypt and certain other places in warm climates; the &s;mall-pox, dy&s;entery and plague u&s;ually appear in cities, camps, or
<PB N="39" REF="036687_0394_100AA3C0B9CFF128">
other unhealthy &s;ituations, without affecting neighboring places, which contain not the &s;ame local cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e. They might therefore, in &s;trict propriety, be denominated <HI>temporary endemics,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to <HI>epidemics</HI> which &s;pread to all places alike; and to <HI>endemics,</HI> which <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> or <HI>u&s;ually</HI> appear in particular parts of the world.</P>
<P>This di&s;tinction however is not very material; and I &s;hall therefore &s;peak of the &s;mall-pox, dy&s;entery and plague, as epi|demic di&s;ea&s;es; meaning by this epithet, that they, at certain times, &s;pread generally over a particular town or region.</P>
<P>The nature and kinds of contagion will be more particularly con&s;idered, in a &s;ub&s;equent &s;ection; the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, is, the order, connection, and progre&s;&s;ion ob&s;ervable in pe&s;tilential epi|demics.</P>
<P>The influence of a certain &s;tate of air in generating epidemics was ob&s;erved by Hippocrates, who has de&s;cribed the prevalent di&s;ea&s;es, in different &s;ea&s;ons. In his &s;econd &s;ection on epidem|ics, he de&s;cribes what he calls "Kata&s;ta&s;is loimodes," a pe&s;ti|lential &s;tate of the air or &s;ea&s;ons. He does not indeed in this pa&s;&s;age mention the <HI>plague,</HI> but he &s;peaks of tho&s;e malignant di&s;|ea&s;es which are, in modern times, the precur&s;ors of the plague, and which are now produced by the &s;tate of weather which he de&s;cribes.</P>
<P>This &s;tate of the &s;ea&s;ons he repre&s;ents thus, "The year was au&s;trinus, remarkable for &s;outherly breezes, rainy and without winds. The fir&s;t part of the year dry, and autumn rainy, with &s;outherly winds, humid and cloudy. In winter, &s;outherly winds, moi&s;t and mild weather. About the vernal equinox, &s;e|vere cold, but the north winds, with &s;now, were of no long du|ration. Spring was again calm, &s;outherly weather&mdash;great rains continued till Augu&s;t&mdash;then clear hot weather&mdash;the cool Ele&s;ian winds blew but little and for &s;hort periods. A rainy autumn, with north winds."</P>
<P>The &s;outherly, hot, humid air here de&s;cribed, whenever of long continuance in &s;ummer, proves the cau&s;e of numerous ma|lignant di&s;ea&s;es, in the United States, as well as in Europe, al|tho not certainly productive of pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="036687_0395_100AA3C32667FC48">Hippocrates proceeds to mention the di&s;ea&s;es which prevailed in this &s;tate of &s;ea&s;ons. "Before &s;pring, even during the cold weather, appeared many ery&s;ipelous di&s;ea&s;es of a malignant type. Di&s;ea&s;es of the fauces, accompanied with hour&s;ene&s;s, ardent fe|vers, with phrenitis; ulcers in the mouth; inflammation of eyes, carbuncles, &amp;c. The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es &s;pread and became epidemic and mortal." The author then proceeds to de&s;cribe the ery&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pelas and other di&s;ea&s;es here named. The&s;e ca&s;es differ from the plague in Athens; and prove that the pe&s;tilence in Tha&s;us, where he wrote, was of milder &s;ymptoms, though probably cotemporary with that epidemic in Athens.</P>
<P>My particular rea&s;on for reciting the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages from Hippoc|rates, is, to prove a progre&s;&s;ivene&s;s in a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air, and the di&s;ea&s;es which it produces. The di&s;ea&s;es here mention|ed are the &s;ame, &s;ub&s;tantially, as tho&s;e which <HI>precede</HI> the plague in modern times, in the countries bordering on the Mediterra|nean, and with little variation, the &s;ame with tho&s;e which pre|cede the plague in all parts of the world. Ery&s;ipelous, or other eruptive di&s;ea&s;es, catarrhous affections, or ardent fevers, are the con&s;tant precur&s;ors of the plague, wherever it appears. Hip|pocrates does not mention any fatal plague, in the &s;tate of air de&s;cribed; and it often happens, at this day, that the &s;trength of the pe&s;tilential principle is arre&s;ted in its progre&s;s, and the ep|idemics are limited, in their violence, to di&s;ea&s;es of a type le&s;s malignant than the true plague, or ari&s;ing to the plague only in a few &s;cattering ca&s;es. But whatever may be the degree of the pe&s;tilential &s;tate of the air, or at whatever point, it may be de&s;|tined to cea&s;e, and yield to a more &s;alubrious con&s;titution, the cla&s;s of di&s;ea&s;es which mark its ri&s;e and progre&s;s, are always &s;imi|lar, or the &s;ame, modified only in the violence of their &s;ymptoms, by accidental circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>A careful attention to the&s;e facts, cannot fail to convince the ob&s;erver of the ju&s;tne&s;s of Sydenham's doctrines, in regard to con&s;titutions of air; and the facts them&s;elves demoli&s;h, at one &s;troke, all the common medical doctrines of the communication of pe&s;tilence from place to place by contagion, or fomites.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the hi&s;tories of ancient plagues furni&s;h but
<PB N="41" REF="036687_0396_100AA3C5E5578A30">
little light on this &s;ubject; yet the barren annals of antiquity and the middle ages, are not wholly de&s;titute of evidence to this point. The progre&s;&s;ion of the plague in Rome, growing more general and fatal to the &s;econd and third year, is a fact re|corded by Livy, and is related in the preceding pages.</P>
<P>The remark of Dion Ca&s;&s;ius, that the a&s;hes from Ve&s;uvius, in the great eruption of 79, produced, that year, only &s;light di&s;ea&s;es, but the next year, an epidemic, has already been no|ticed. It leaves no room to que&s;tion, that the de&s;tructive plague of the year 80, was preceded by epidemic di&s;orders of a le&s;s ma|lignant type.</P>
<P>The middle ages furni&s;h facts in confirmation of this doctrin. Witne&s;s the great plague in 1112, which was preceded by ery|&s;ipelous di&s;ea&s;es in England in 1109, and great mortality in 1111. The plague of 1242, which was preceded by great mortality in 12<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0&mdash;the &s;ame fact is ob&s;ervable in the pe&s;tilence of 1252, 1368, 1379, 1390, 1517, 1527, 1575, 1636&mdash;and in many other in&s;tances.</P>
<P>This fact did not e&s;cape the notice of that accurate ob&s;erver of nature, Lord Bacon, who lived at a period when the plague frequently infe&s;ted England. He &s;ays, "The le&s;&s;er infections of the &s;mall-pox, purple fever, agues, &amp;c. in the preceding &s;um|mer, and hovering all the winter, <HI>portend a great pe&s;tilence the fol|lowing &s;ummer,</HI> for putrefaction ri&s;es not to its height at once." Works, vol. 3, p. 59.</P>
<P>That &s;tate of air which produces pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, Lord Bacon denominates <HI>putrefaction;</HI> but whatever appellation we may give to the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of pe&s;tilence, the remark is demon&s;trably well founded, that this "ri&s;es not to its height at once." It is progre&s;&s;ive; producing fir&s;t the "le&s;&s;er infections." The plague is rarely, if ever, an original, di&s;tinct, i&s;olated di&s;ea&s;e; but the la&s;t or mo&s;t mortal form of a &s;eries of malignant di&s;tempers. The <HI>purple</HI> fever mentioned by Lord Bacon is nearly allied to the <HI>petechial</HI> fever, which is the u&s;ual precur&s;or of pe&s;tilence in the Levant.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al plague of 1635, 6 and 7, was preceded by the
<PB N="42" REF="036687_0397_100AA3C78DC9FBC8">
u&s;ual di&s;ea&s;es, and the progre&s;s of them is di&s;tinctly traced by the learned Diemerbroeck. He remarks, chap. 3 de pe&s;te, that "the &s;pring of 1635, was warm and moderately humid, to which &s;ucceeded a very hot, dry &s;ea&s;on, in which appeared many ma|lignant epidemics. In the fir&s;t place, a &s;evere plague broke out at Leyden, and de&s;troyed more than 20,000 lives. At Ni|meguen, in Gueldres and other regions, a certain pe&s;tilent fe|ver &s;pread with dreadful mortality. In autumn, the &s;evere heat &s;till continuing with exce&s;&s;ive drouth, many other malignant di&s;|ea&s;es appeared, as &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, diarrhea and dy&s;entery of a very bad type; but above all, the above mentioned pe&s;tilential purple fever, called in Italy <HI>petechial,</HI> increa&s;ed daily in extent and violence, <HI>until it turned into the true plague</HI>&mdash;"donec tandem in aperti&s;&s;imam pe&s;tem tran&s;iret."&mdash;The author goes on to remark that from November through the winter, &s;cattering ca&s;es of plague occurred in Nimeguen. In January 1636, it increa&s;ed, and in March &s;pread and became epidemic&mdash;ro&s;e to its height in April, and continued till October. See pages 5 and 6.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age contains a number of important facts. Fir&s;t&mdash;the &s;ea&s;ons were in&s;alubrious. Secondly&mdash;the pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air extended to many places at the &s;ame time: In another page, the author &s;ays the pe&s;tilence &s;pread over almo&s;t all Germany and the low countries. Thrdly&mdash;this &s;tate of air was of different de|grees of malignity or violence, in different places at the &s;ame time. Thus, the plague appeared at Leyden early in 1635, but cotemporary with this, was the appearance of the purple fever in Nimeguen and in other places; and during the &s;ummer and au|tumn, this and other epidemics continued to rage with great mor|tality, and at la&s;t, the &s;trength of the pe&s;tilential principle increa|&s;ing, the fever changed its form, and appeared in the true plague.</P>
<P>Now, the modern way of accounting for the plague in Nime|guen, would be to <HI>allege</HI> or <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> &s;ome infected goods to have conveyed the contagion from Leyden, where it fir&s;t appeared; and then to <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> the infection to be carried to Leyden from the Levant.</P>
<P>The philo&s;ophic Diemerbroeck, who was pre&s;ent and ob&s;erved all the circum&s;tances, <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> nothing. He relates plain facts
<PB N="43" REF="036687_0398_100AA3CA4F408698">
ju&s;t as they occurred, and admits that the plague mu&s;t have ori|ginated in the country.</P>
<P>By con&s;idering the malignant epidemics that prevailed at that time, as connected and depending on the &s;ame general cau&s;e, we &s;olve all the difficulties attending the origin of the plague. The petechial fever, which appeared at Nimeguen and other places, in 1635, was <HI>one of the forms</HI> in which the general contagion of the period, exhibited its effects on the human con&s;titution. It was a <HI>part</HI> of the pe&s;tilence&mdash;it could not be conveyed from Ley|den, for it appeared in mo&s;t parts of the low countries and in Ger|many, at the &s;ame time. The &s;ame general cau&s;e, an indi&s;po&s;i|tion in the elements to &s;upport healthy life, produced various pe&s;|tilential di&s;ea&s;es, according to place, &s;ea&s;on, age, habit of body and con&s;titution, until its &s;trength and violence aro&s;e to their height, and gradually introduced the wor&s;t form of pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>The idea of Diemerbroeck, that the purple fever "turned to the plague," mu&s;t give great offence to the followers of Mead and Cullen, the advocates for the doctrin of the propagation of the plague &s;olely by &s;pecific contagion. It oppo&s;es efficaciou&s;ly their whole theory, and levels it with the earth.</P>
<P>The fact is however indi&s;putable. In the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing period from 1569 to 1577, when Europe was almo&s;t depopulated by the &s;potted fever, phy&s;icians ob&s;erved that this di&s;ea&s;e frequently turned into the plague, and the plague into the &s;potted fever. The &s;ame fact was often noticed by writers of the 16th and 17th cen|turies, in which the plague frequently overran Europe.&mdash;The&s;e two di&s;ea&s;es, are therefore two di&s;tinct forms or modifications of pe&s;tilence&mdash;probably bearing an affinity to each other, like that between the di&s;tinct and confluent &s;mall-pox. This fact &s;hows that the di&s;tinction made by medical writers, between <HI>pe&s;tis</HI> and <HI>pe&s;tilentia,</HI> the plague and other pe&s;tilential di&s;tempers, however u&s;eful in practice, is not authorized by truth and philo&s;ophy. The ancients cla&s;&s;ed all contagious epidemics together, and de|nominated them <HI>pe&s;tilence;</HI> and this di&s;tribution, in regard to their cau&s;es and origin, was doubtle&s;s mo&s;t philo&s;ophical. The di&s;tri|bution made by modern phy&s;icians, &s;eems to have ari&s;en out of differences of &s;ymptoms, and to be be&s;t adapted to practice. At
<PB N="44" REF="036687_0399_100AA3CD70EFFFF8">
the &s;ame time, it has probably been the occa&s;ion of the common error of con&s;idering different &s;pecies or forms of pe&s;tilence, as di&s;ea&s;es of generical difference, and proceeding wholly from di&s;|tinct cau&s;es, when in fact they all have <HI>one general cau&s;e</HI> in com|mon, and the varieties of their &s;ymptoms proceed from <HI>di&s;tinct lo|cal</HI> and <HI>temporary cau&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>On this &s;ubject the learned Riverius, in his Praxeos Medicae, lib. 17. has many judicious remarks. He ob&s;erves, "That authors, who wrote on fevers, di&s;tingui&s;h a pe&s;tilent from a ma|lignant fever&mdash;by pe&s;tilent fever they under&s;tand the true plague; by a malignant one, the fever vulgarly called <HI>purple,</HI> or other fe|ver, which tho epidemic and contagious, is le&s;s dangerous, and in which more patients &s;urvive than peri&s;h&mdash;whereas the e&s;&s;ence of the true plague con&s;i&s;ts in this, that it de&s;troys more than half who are &s;eized with it." He however con&s;iders the&s;e fevers as differing mo&s;tly in degree of malignity, and therefore treats of them under one head.</P>
<P>A pe&s;tilent fever this author con&s;iders as not proceeding &s;olely from intemperate heat, or putridity; but from a malignant and poi&s;onous quality; and whenever this quality appears in a fever, whether quotidian, hectic or putrid, he thinks it ought to be de|nominated <HI>pe&s;tilent.</HI> A pe&s;tilent fever differs from the plague as &s;pecies from genus becau&s;e there may be plague without fever.</P>
<P>This author remarks al&s;o the connection between certain epi|demics. "Many deadly di&s;ea&s;es accompany the prevalence of pe&s;tilence&mdash;as phrenitis, anginas, pleuri&s;ies, peripneumonies, in|flamations of the liver, dy&s;enteries and many others." He a&s;|cribes epidemics to the &s;tate of air, as a common cau&s;e, to which he adds the u&s;ual local or particular cau&s;es, which modify its in|fluence.</P>
<P>Pro&s;per Alpinus informs us that the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es prevail al&s;o in Egypt, at certain times; but he gives no account of their order or connection. Vol. 2. p. 73.</P>
<P>Bellinus de&s;cribes the phenomena which precede the plague, which he calls its <HI>antecedents.</HI> After mentioning food of a bad quality, impure air from exhalations, intemperate &s;ea&s;ons, va|pours emitted during earthquakes and the like, he &s;ays, "Mox

<P>Other authors refer this cata&s;trophe to the period of pe&s;tilence la&s;t mentioned, which &s;ome writers place in the year of Rome 388, and others, in 384; but all agree that it was during the approximation of a comet. This la&s;t pe&s;tilence was dreadful in the extreme, &s;paring no age or &s;ex. The year after it, the earth opened and exhibited a va&s;t cha&s;m in the mid&s;t of Rome, into which M.

The hundred and third Olympiad, according to our common chro|nology, comprehends the years of Rome from 386 to 389, in|clu&s;ive. It is probable that in one of the &s;hocks of this &s;eries of earthquakes, the cha&s;m was made in Rome as already related. It will be ob&s;erved that this event <HI>followed</HI> the pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>The comet that appeared, during this calamity, was probably that mentioned by Ari&s;totle, Meteorol. lib. 1. ca. 6, of which he was an eye-witne&s;s.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not omit what authors relate concerning the pe|culiar character of this plague. Oro&s;ius &s;ays, it was not &s;uch a pe&s;tilence, as u&s;ually proceeded from irregular &s;ea&s;ons, extreme drouth, &s;udden heat of the &s;pring, un&s;ea&s;onable moi&s;ture of &s;um|mer and autumn, or the impure air blown from the Calabrian groves; but &s;evere and continued, attacking all de&s;criptions of people, and either de&s;troying their lives, or leaving them in a weak and mi&s;erable condition.</P>
<P>The winter when the comet appeared Ari&s;totle relates to have been cold; but the &s;everity and duration of the plague cannot be accounted for on the principle of changes or irregularities in the &s;ea&s;ons. It was one of tho&s;e violent epidemics which never afflict mankind, without &s;ome e&s;&s;ential alteration in the invi&s;ible

began to appear, &s;ix months before the arrival of the infection from Syria!</P>
<P>In Aleppo, the plague which appeared in 1742, was <HI>preceded</HI> by an acute fever; and after the di&s;ea&s;e abated in July, appeared diarrheas and dy&s;entery of a malignant type, attended in many ca&s;es with petechae, and intermittents which often proved fatal. The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, in their acute forms, prevailed al&s;o with the plague, which in this year was not &s;evere, nor wholly the predominant epidemic.</P>
<P>This continued acute fever and pleuri&s;ies, ran through the win|ter. In November appeared a few ca&s;es of the plague. Where the <HI>infection</HI> had lain dormant from July to November, the author of this account, Alexander Ru&s;&s;ell, has not informed us.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of 1743, the plague again appeared and &s;pread in the city, and at the u&s;ual time in &s;ummer &s;ub&s;ided, being again &s;ucceeded by other acute di&s;orders, which by bleeding and pur|ging, were formed into tertians, double tertians and quotidians.</P>
<P>Here again we have the &s;ame progre&s;&s;ion in the &s;tate of the pe&s;tilence, which had been remarked by Hippocrates, Bacon and Sydenham. During the exi&s;tence of this pe&s;tilential con&s;titu|tion in Aleppo, all the ordinary di&s;ea&s;es of the country a&s;&s;umed a more malignant type; or as Sydenham remarked of the di&s;|ea&s;es which preceded the plague of 1665, they "differed from the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es in other years, by new and unu&s;ual &s;ymptoms, which in &s;hort amounted to this, that they were all <HI>more violent.</HI>" See vol. 1, p. 20.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;es changed their form with the &s;ea&s;ons&mdash;the acute fever preceding ran into plague, and plague ran into malignant dy&s;entery, tertians, and other acute di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>Similar facts are ob&s;erved in America. The plague has been preceded by acute di&s;ea&s;es, as anginas, remittents of a bad type, &amp;c. and followed by remittents, dy&s;entery and malignant pleuri&s;y.</P>
<P>The dreadful plague at Me&s;&s;ina in 1743, which de&s;troyed two thirds of its inhabitants, was introduced by a malignant fever. One phy&s;ician alone out of thirty-three, pronounced it the plague; the others denied it, becau&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e was not attended with glandular &s;wellings.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="036687_0402_100AA3D1D7B198F8">A &s;imilar fever preceded the &s;evere plague at Venice in 1576, and the &s;ame uncertainty at fir&s;t embarra&s;&s;ed the phy&s;icians and magi&s;tracy.</P>
<P>The terrible pe&s;tilence at Naples in 1656, was announced by the u&s;ual herald of the di&s;ea&s;e, a malignant fever. One phy&s;i|cian alone pronounced it the plague, and for his audacity was im|pri&s;oned by the Viceroy.</P>
<P>The exten&s;ive pe&s;tilence which &s;pread over all the Levant countries and i&s;lands, from 1759 to 1763, was every where pre|ceded by a &s;imilar increa&s;e of malignant di&s;ea&s;es, and e&s;pecially by the petechial fever, which appeared, at Aleppo, in the year next previous to the plague. Yet the author of this account, Patrick Ru&s;&s;el, labors very gravely to trace the di&s;ea&s;e to Turks from Egypt and their old clothes.</P>
<P>The uncertainty among phy&s;icians, at the commencement of a plague, with re&s;pect to the nature of the di&s;order, is a &s;trong proof of the doctrin for which I contend. Van Helmont, Diemer|broeck and others have found it nece&s;&s;ary to lay down rules with a great degree of care and caution, to enable them&s;elves to de|termin, whether a malignant di&s;ea&s;e is the plague or not. Van Helmont ob&s;erves, p. 1138 that he could perceive no difference in the pul&s;e, in plague and continual fevers of the malignant kind &mdash;that buboes in the groin, paroitides, &amp;c. are not unfrequently found in fevers free from plague; and &s;ometimes &s;pots and car|buncles. But, &s;ays he, if many of the&s;e appearances do concur, there is no difficulty in pronouncing it the plague, e&s;pecially if they appear before or early after the fever.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck declares, that no one &s;ymptom determines a di&s;ea&s;e to be the plague&mdash;neither fever, buboes nor carbuncles are e&s;&s;ential to that di&s;ea&s;e, for it often pa&s;&s;es off without either&mdash; many of its &s;ymptoms are common to that and other di&s;tempers&mdash; the exi&s;tence of the di&s;ea&s;e therefore is to be determined by a view of all the circum&s;tances, and one criterion, he remarks, is, the prevalence of the plague in neighboring towns.</P>
<P>This la&s;t remark indicates that the author had ob&s;erved the exi&s;tence of pe&s;tilence in various places at the &s;ame time, to be a common event.</P>

<P>It has been the &s;ame in the United States. The fir&s;t ca&s;es of the bilious plague have occured early in &s;ummer, u&s;ually in July, &s;ometimes in June.

This however has ever been a mi&s;take; they were the le&s;s malignant forms of approaching pe&s;tilence; yet five or &s;ix weeks after their appearance, when the epidemic has &s;howed it&s;elf in its formidable array, our citizents have hunted out &s;ome ve&s;&s;el from &s;outhern climates and palmed the evil on her &s;eamen or cargo.</P>
<P>Van Swieten, Comment. vol. 16, 3. remarks, "that the plague has &s;ometimes lain concealed under the ma&s;k of other di&s;|ea&s;es. When the plague raged at Vienna in 1713, it frequently a&s;&s;umed the appearance of a pleuri&s;y, catarrh, or quin&s;y, but &s;oon after, broke out buboes and carbuncles, mo&s;t certain &s;igns of the plague, accompanied with the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms."</P>
<P>Here we ob&s;erve the u&s;ual precur&s;ors and companions of the plague and the progre&s;&s;ion of the pe&s;tilential principle.</P>
<P>Hippocrates has remarked the augmented violence of di&s;ea&s;es, in particular periods. He &s;ays, "There are times when almo&s;t all the di&s;ea&s;es that occur, are extremely malignant, and in gen|eral, fatal, &s;o that coughs, phthi&s;is, angina, are all equally mor|tal. He a&s;&s;ures us, that the truth of his ob&s;ervations had been confirmed, in countries very different from each other, and in a variety of &s;ea&s;ons and climates." See the pa&s;&s;age cited in Zim|merman on phy&s;ic, p. 163.</P>
<P>We have multiplied proofs of the ju&s;tne&s;s of the&s;e remarks. During the periods which I call <HI>pe&s;tilential,</HI> the common di&s;ea&s;es of a country, as dy&s;entery, and intermittents, become more ob&s;tinate and mortal; and even the pleuri&s;y and peripneumony, acquire unu&s;ual violence. And it may not be improper to re|peat an ob&s;ervation before made, that the malignant or epidemic pleuri&s;y never appears, excep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> during the&s;e pe&s;tilential periods.

It precedes or follows, in winter, &s;pring or autumn, tho&s;e &s;um|mers alone when pe&s;tilence invades our cities. Such was the dreadful di&s;ea&s;e in America, in 1697-8&mdash;in 1761&mdash;and which has &s;howed it&s;elf, in &s;everal towns, during the pre&s;ent pe&s;tilential con&s;titution.</P>
<P>But a mo&s;t &s;atisfactory proof of the progre&s;&s;ivene&s;s in a pe&s;ti|lential &s;tate of air, and in the corre&s;ponding malignity of di&s;|ea&s;es, is found in the bills of mortality. Thus, before the Lon|don plague in 1625, the bill of mortality ro&s;e from 8 or 9000, the &s;tandard of health, to 11,000 in 1623, and to 12,000 in 1624. The approach of pe&s;tilence was clearly announced, two years before it appeared. And as the time of its appearance drew near, the exten&s;ion or malignity of the preceding fevers was greatly augmented; for in the year of the plague, almo&s;t nineteen thou&s;and per&s;ons died of other di&s;ea&s;es than the plague. As the plague u&s;ually prevails from June or July to November, and other di&s;ea&s;es are mo&s;tly merged in it, almo&s;t all the deaths by common di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t have been in the beginning of the year, from January to June or July. Now, eighteen thou&s;and deaths in the &s;ix months preceding the plague, or even two thirds of the number, mark a prodigious increa&s;e of mortality&mdash;the <HI>common &s;ign of approaching pe&s;tilence.</HI></P>
<P>In the pe&s;tilential period in London, from 1634 to 1636, the bill of mortality ro&s;e two years previous to the plague.</P>
<P>The la&s;t great plague, in 1665, was announced by unu&s;ual malignity in di&s;ea&s;es, four years before its appearance. In 1661, according to Sydenham, began a &s;eries of epidemics, which greatly &s;welled the li&s;t of burials. There was however &s;ome a|batement in 1663; but in 1664, and the fir&s;t five months of 1665, the mortality again increa&s;ed with rapidity, till a dread|ful pe&s;tilence laid wa&s;te the city.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar increa&s;e of mortality is ob&s;ervable in the bills for Aug&s;burg, previous to the plague in 1628, and in 1635&mdash;in Dre&s;den, in 1632 and 3&mdash;in Philadelphia in 1793, in New-York in 1795, and in New-London in 1798.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t however be ob&s;erved, that the bills of mortality will

not, in all ca&s;es, exhibit the augmented number and malignancy of the di&s;ea&s;es which precede pe&s;tilence; for it &s;ometimes hap|pens that the year next preceding the plague, is very healthy, and the malignancy in the di&s;tempers, which mark the beginning of the pe&s;tilential &s;tate, does not appear till the winter or &s;pring previous to the plague. In this ca&s;e, the augmented mortality falls within the year and the &s;ame bills, as the deaths by the plague. This was the ca&s;e in Aug&s;burg in the year 1535. In &s;uch ca&s;es, there is an interval between the preceding epidemics and the plague; &s;uch as we have ob&s;erved in the New-England States, between the influenza and the &s;carlet fever, and the lat|ter di&s;ea&s;e and the yellow fever.</P>
<P>Monthly bills will exhibit the progre&s;s of pe&s;tilential epidem|ics, with more accuracy.</P>
<P>Fernelius remarks page 161, that "infection is to be perceiv|ed in the air, when it produces fevers not pe&s;tilent, but which are at the thre&s;hhold of pe&s;tilence,"&mdash;plainly intimating that cer|tain malignant di&s;ea&s;es precede the plague. He &s;peaks of the fact as general and well under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Even in the We&s;t-Indies, the infectious yellow fever has its pre|cur&s;ors. That fever in Barbadoes, in 1738, was preceded by catarrh and &s;uffocating cough in 1737 and &s;pring of 1738. Yet authors pretend the di&s;ea&s;e to have been <HI>imported</HI> from Martinico!</P>

<P>The different modes in which pe&s;tilence invades mankind, &s;eem to depend on different cau&s;es. Sometimes, the principal cau&s;e &s;eems to be an e&s;&s;ential alteration in the invi&s;ible properties of the elements; in which ca&s;e, the di&s;ea&s;es of a particular con|&s;titution, tho &s;omewhat modified in their &s;ymptoms, are not con|trolled or arre&s;ted by the &s;ea&s;ons. On the contrary the atmo&s;phere continues to be pe&s;tilential, and to multiply di&s;orders of a ma|lignant type, through every variety of &s;ea&s;ons and of weather. Thus, we ob&s;erve many in&s;tances of violent plagues in the mo&s;t plea&s;ant, and to all appearance, the mo&s;t &s;alubrious &s;ea&s;ons. Several in&s;tances have been mentioned in the preceding hi&s;tory, and we have demon&s;tration of the fact in the United States. The pre&s;ent pe&s;tilential &s;tate commenced with the mea&s;les and

catarrh of 1789 and 90.&mdash;The &s;ummers of 1794 and of 1797 were apparently temperate and &s;alubrious; yet in both the&s;e &s;ummers, the plague renewed its ravages in &s;ome towns, tho with le&s;s mortality than in the &s;ultry and unhealthy &s;ummers of 1793-95 and 98.</P>
<P>On the other hand, pe&s;tilence &s;ometimes proceeds principally from exce&s;&s;ively intemperate &s;ea&s;ons, as in &s;evere heat, after a cold winter. In this ca&s;e, the pe&s;tilence may invade a city very &s;uddenly and without a regular augmentation of mortality from previous di&s;ea&s;es. But even in this ca&s;e, the plague has its precur|&s;ors, which appear at lea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a few weeks, if not two or three months previous to its attack.</P>
<P>Thus the plague in Aleppo in 1742, fir&s;t &s;howed it&s;elf in the &s;uburbs in April; but was preceded by an acute fever in March. The bilious plague in Philadelphia in 1793, according to Dr. Ru&s;h, was preceded by the influenza, &s;carlatina and bilious re|mittents. The &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e in 1797 appeared, in &s;cattering ca|&s;es, as early as June.</P>
<P>In New-York, the epidemic of 1795 was preceded by an|gina trachealis with anomalous &s;ymptoms, &s;ome ca&s;es of ob&s;ti|nate dy&s;entery, at a premature &s;tage of &s;ummer, and by febrile complaints accompanied with bilious evacuations. At a meeting of the medical &s;ociety, early in July, the&s;e facts were mentioned, as denoting an uncommon &s;tate of air, and the &s;ociety came to a re&s;olution, to make particular ob&s;ervations on the di&s;ea&s;es that might occur, before their next meeting. But, in the interval, the cri&s;is of the pe&s;tilence arrived, and removed all doubts.</P>
<BIBL>See Dr. Baily on the epidemic of 1795, p. 55, and &s;equel.</BIBL>
<P>The &s;evere pe&s;tilence of the year 1798 doubtle&s;s owes its vio|lence to a &s;eries of mo&s;t intemperate weather&mdash;mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive heat, following a long and &s;everely cold winter. Yet this di&s;|ea&s;e was preceded by premonitory &s;igns, e&s;pecially catarrhal fe|vers. Of all the di&s;orders to which mankind are expo&s;ed, none &s;eem to indicate a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air, with &s;o much certainty as catarrhal affections.

of the progre&s;&s;ion of pe&s;tilence, let me mention Skenkius, who, in &s;peaking of the di&s;ea&s;es of 1564 and 5, ob&s;erves, that angi|nas, pleuri&s;ies and peripneumonies became epidemic; abortions were frequent, pains in the joints, &s;mall pox and mea&s;les "quos tanquam praecur&s;ores &s;equebatur epidemica lues, incredibili gra&s;|&s;ationis &s;aevitia," depopula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing towns and country, in Turkey, Egypt, France, England and Germany.

<P>Skenkius remarked that the plague followed the other epidem|ics, as <HI>its precur&s;ors.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame author takes notice of a malignant angina, in 1564, which often proved fatal in a few hours, like the plague. I men|tion this, becau&s;e the learned Dr. Fothergill, and tribes of mod|ern phy&s;icians who follow a celebrated name, have alledged that the angina maligna is a new di&s;ea&s;e, not known in Europe till a|bout the year 1610, altho it never was more fatal, than in England in 1517.</P>
<P>In 1573 prevailed dy&s;entery, mea&s;les, and purple fever, which in 1574, &s;ays Skenkius, <HI>changed into the plague.</HI> His words are remarkable.

<P>It is a common remark that the reigning epidemic &s;ubdues all other di&s;ea&s;es, or compels them to a&s;&s;ume its character. This re|mark, as a general one, is ju&s;t; and is of no &s;mall weight, in proving the connection between certain &s;pecies of epidemics. In the &s;pring of 1795, the mea&s;les prevailed in New-York, but of a mild type. In Augu&s;t, this di&s;ea&s;e di&s;appeared, being com|pletely merged in the bilious fever that &s;pread from Augu&s;t to November. No &s;ooner had the fever &s;ub&s;ided, than the mea&s;les
<PB N="53" REF="036687_0408_100AA3D6AFF29CC8">
re-appeared, and was of a le&s;s favorable type. This is a con|tagious di&s;ea&s;e, and yet how impotent was its contagion, in the in&s;tance related, under the all-controlling influence of the &s;ea&s;on and the elements.&mdash;It di&s;appeared in &s;ummer in defiance of the powers of &s;pecific contagion, and was reproduced in autumn, with|out its a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>This fact demon&s;trates that a general cau&s;e operated in the production of that di&s;ea&s;e; which general cau&s;e, in &s;ummer, was controlled, by the heat of the &s;ea&s;on and local cau&s;es in that city; the&s;e temporary and local cau&s;es operated during a particu|lar time, and gave a different complexion to di&s;ea&s;es; when they gave way, at the approach of winter, the general cau&s;e again a&s;|&s;umed its empire and reproduced the mea&s;les, which is a di&s;ea&s;e little affected by local cau&s;es.</P>
<P>But while local cau&s;es predominated, in producing bilious plague, the general cau&s;e was not altogether inefficient; no bil|ious pe&s;tilence ever becoming epidemic and infectious, but un|der the influence of a pe&s;tilential con&s;titution.</P>
<P>A fact related in Fairfield's diary, relative to the &s;mall-pox in Bo&s;ton in 1702, is very much in point.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e appeared in June and gave much alarm; but prov|ed to be of a mild type, and none died of it for &s;everal weeks. It continued to be favorable, till September, when it a&s;&s;umed a more formidable a&s;pect; being attended with what the writer calls a &s;carlet fever. The &s;ea&s;on was exce&s;&s;ively dry. In De|cember, the &s;carlet fever abated, but the &s;mall-pox continued to be very mortal, till the following &s;pring. The&s;e facts are relat|ed by an unlettered, ob&s;erving man; but they are evidence of a progre&s;&s;ivene&s;s in the di&s;ea&s;e. The efflore&s;cence that accompa|nied the di&s;ea&s;e from September to December was only a partic|ular, malignant &s;ymptom or modification of the &s;mall-pox, pro|duced by &s;ea&s;on or other temporary cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The mea&s;les often exhibits a &s;imilar progre&s;&s;ion. This cir|cum&s;tance explains the difficulties mentioned by medical writers. Dr. Ru&s;h mentions the circum&s;tance of per&s;ons in 1789, who had a fever, cough and all the &s;ymptoms of mea&s;les, except a general eruption. Some had a trifling efflore&s;cence about the

neck and brea&s;t. The &s;ame happened in 1773 and 1783. Vol. 2. 238. The fact is al&s;o mentioned in Edinburgh Medical E&s;|&s;ays, vol. 5. Per&s;ons thus affected have the mea&s;les, months or years afterwards. This lighter &s;pecies of the mea&s;les is pro|duced by the &s;ame general cau&s;e which produces the di&s;ea&s;e in full force; but the con&s;titution, at that time, re&s;i&s;ts the further operation of the cau&s;e. At a future time the cau&s;e will produce the di&s;ea&s;e complete.</P>
<P>Under the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;es of 1792 and 3, I have re|lated the progre&s;s of the late &s;carlatina in this country. There cannot be &s;tronger evidence of the progre&s;&s;ion of an epidemic in|fluence in the atmo&s;phere than the hi&s;tory of that di&s;temper has furni&s;hed. The violent &s;tage of that di&s;ea&s;e, was preceded four, five, and in &s;ome places eight months, by a milder &s;pecies of the di&s;order; and this mild form was, in &s;ome places, an epidemic. The&s;e facts entirely overwhelm all the pretended influence of in|fection, in originating the di&s;ea&s;e. They prove inconte&s;tibly that a &s;tate of air &s;uited to the production of that di&s;ea&s;e, was not the effect of any &s;udden, vi&s;ible change in the &s;ea&s;ons; for the mild form of the &s;carlatina appeared indifferently, in any &s;ea&s;on of the year; as at New-York in Augu&s;t, at Hartford in May and at New-Haven in November; but that it was a progre&s;|&s;ive change, gradually inducing debility in the human body, or whatever el&s;e may be its predi&s;po&s;ition to a particular di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Whether the &s;carlatina appeared, in any part of the country, without being announced by this &s;light form of the di&s;ea&s;e, is a que&s;tion that cannot be &s;olved, without particular information from every town. And very po&s;&s;ibly the fact it&s;elf may have pa&s;&s;ed, in &s;ome places, unob&s;erved. But the progre&s;&s;ivene&s;s of the di&s;temper was di&s;tinctly marked in New-York, in Fairfield, in New-Haven, in Bethlem and in Hartford.</P>
<P>The &s;ame phenomenon was ob&s;erved in the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, in 1786, in London. The fir&s;t ca&s;e appeared in March, was of a mild kind and excited no great apprehen&s;ion. No other ca&s;e oc|curred to the knowledge of the phy&s;ician, except in the &s;ame family, till May, when another ca&s;e appeared, but of a light kind. In June, the di&s;ea&s;e became epidemic and malignant.

Here we ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of the pe&s;tilential principle, in England, like that which has been ob&s;erved in America.</P>

<P>A remarkable fact mentioned by the great Mr. Boyle, in the fifth volume of his works, p. 724, &s;erves to &s;how the regular progre&s;&s;ion of that &s;tate of air which produces the plague. In 1665, three months before the plague broke out in London, a man &s;ent for a phy&s;ician, complaining of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;welling in his groin, from which circum&s;tance he predicted the plague which was to follow, and &s;aid he had experienced the &s;ame &s;welling in the former plagues, which he con&s;idered as the certain forerunner of the di&s;|ea&s;e. Boyle took this account from the phy&s;ician him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This was no whim, for it is perfectly philo&s;ophical. It is a common fact, that, during the plague, in a city, per&s;ons in health experience &s;evere pains in the glands, as in the groin and under the arms, tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible parts which are peculiarly affected by the di&s;ea&s;e. Sorbait mentions that he felt &s;uch pains, during the plague in Vienna in 1679, and others did the &s;ame, but without any tumor. Dr. Gothwald experienced &s;imilar pains in the plague at Dantzick in 1709.</P>
<BIBL>See Baddam's Memoirs, vol. 6. 12.</BIBL>
<P>Boyle, vol. 6. 429, relates that one Beale knew a woman who could certainly tell when the plague was in the neighboring country, by a pain in the wounds of three &s;ores &s;he had, when affected by the plague in her youth. The relation is altogether credible; for we know that the &s;tate of air producing the di&s;|ea&s;e, occa&s;ions pains in the glands of per&s;ons in health; much more therefore would the &s;ame parts, after being rendered more &s;en&s;ible by plague &s;ores, be affected with pain, during a &s;imilar &s;tate of air. The facts demon&s;trate that the plague is produced by a peculiar &s;tate of air, which may be perceived before the di&s;|ea&s;e appears; and much more, during its prevalance, by per&s;ons in health.</P>
<P>Another fact demon&s;trative of the &s;ame doctrin of a progre&s;|&s;ion in the pe&s;tilential principle, is, the unu&s;ual number of abor|tions, which <HI>precede</HI> the inva&s;ion of a &s;evere plague. This fact was ob&s;erved by Diemerbroeck, previous to the plague in Ni|mueguen,
<PB N="56" REF="036687_0411_100AA41994FDC398">
in 1636, and is numbered by him among the pre&s;ages of the di&s;ea&s;e. De pe&s;te page 11. Other authors have record|ed the &s;ame fact, among whom Diemerbroeck cites Alexander Benedictus, Fore&s;tus and Seunertus.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned for this phenomenon, is, "the debility of the heart and other vi&s;cera, which renders the tender body of the foetus incapable of re&s;i&s;ting the malignity of the pe&s;tilential poi&s;on, and which expo&s;es the woman in a pregnant &s;tate, to continual irritation."</P>
<P>In confirmation of this principle, we may cite the facts, &s;o fre|quently mentioned by writers on this &s;ubject, that the plague rarely or never &s;pares pregnant women. This was remarked by Livy and Diony&s;ius in Rome&mdash;by Procopius and Evagrius, in the plagues of 543 and 590, and by &s;ub&s;equent writers.</P>
<P>The fact authorizes the &s;uppo&s;ition, that a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air induces extreme excitement or irritability, and con&s;equently indirect debility, e&s;pecially in the nervous and va&s;cular &s;y&s;tems. The effect of this general cau&s;e mu&s;t of cour&s;e be fir&s;t vi&s;ible in per&s;ons mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of excitement&mdash;among whom are preg|nant women, which is obvious from the facility with which they receive impre&s;&s;ions from the &s;ight of unnatural objects. The ap|pearance of the effect of the pe&s;tilential &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, on &s;uch per&s;ons, <HI>previous to its fatal effects on other per&s;ons,</HI> leaves no room to que&s;tion its gradual increa&s;e in &s;trength.</P>
<P>Of the progre&s;&s;ivene&s;s of pe&s;tilential epidemics therefore we can have no doubt, nor of their connection through a common cau&s;e. The order i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which they &s;how them&s;elves is not exactly the &s;ame; being varied by a multitude of &s;ubordinate cau&s;es, as &s;ea&s;ons, weather, noxious exhalations, and &s;ometimes perhaps by infection.</P>
<P>The accounts of di&s;ea&s;es in the two or three la&s;t centuries are recorded with &s;o little regard to ju&s;t arrangement, that it is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ea&s;y to collect from them the exact order in time, in which the epidemics of any particular period have appeared. Sydenham however has left an admirable &s;ample of the hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ory of epidem+ics in London from 1661 to 1680&mdash;a &s;amp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e that throws im|men&s;e light on the principles here maintained&mdash;a &s;ample which
<PB N="57" REF="036687_0412_100AA3DDF28ACC08">
ought to be well &s;tudied, and which it is inexcu&s;eable in medical writers not to imitate. Let any man ob&s;erve the regularity with which certain eruptive di&s;ea&s;es, as the mea&s;les and &s;mall-pox, appeared and &s;ub&s;ided, according to the &s;ea&s;ons, during the con|&s;titution of air fitted to produce them, until both yielded to a different con&s;titution, and then &s;ay, whether he can que&s;tion Sydenham's principles, or the exi&s;tence of a general contagion, operating in the production of a particular cla&s;s of di&s;ea&s;es. Un|der a philo&s;ophical view of &s;uch facts, into what trifles will dwindle all the formidable vulgar doctrines about infection!</P>
<P>It mu&s;t however be remarked, that the &s;mall-pox, in modern times, will not exhibit &s;imilar effects as formerly; &s;ince the art of inoculation has nearly bani&s;hed the di&s;ea&s;e as an epidemic, from our cities, where alone it u&s;ed to prevail to any con&s;iderable extent.</P>
<P>Let us then attend to the order of the epidemics which have marked the late&s;t periods of pe&s;tilence in America; many of which are within the memory of the pre&s;ent generation.</P>

<P>Such has been the general cour&s;e of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es in Ame|rica, as far as I can obtain information. Further enquiries may render the account more accurate, and more nearly perfect.</P>
<P>It will be ob&s;erved that the order is not quite uniform; nor is this to be expected, con&s;idering the various cau&s;es which concur in the production, and diver&s;ification of di&s;ea&s;es. In general, mea&s;les and catarrh precede anginas, dy&s;entery and pe&s;tilential fevers. And it is remarkable that the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es belong to the cla&s;s of inflammatory diathe&s;is: So does the mild &s;mall-pox, which, before the practice of inoculation, was almo&s;t regularly a precur&s;or of the plague in the cities of Europe.</P>
<P>In general then epidemic di&s;ea&s;es fir&s;t attack the brain and the throat, before they &s;eize the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem and the abdo|minal vi&s;cera. It is ob&s;ervable al&s;o, that winter, &s;pring and autumn, produce mo&s;tly di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;tenic diathe&s;is, as mea&s;les, catarrh, and inflammatory fevers; and &s;ummer, di&s;ea&s;es of a&s;tenic diathe|&s;is, as typhus fevers, dy&s;entery of a malignant kind, and plague. Indeed the plague &s;eems to begin and end in catarrh&mdash;that is, it begins in catarrh in winter and &s;pring, takes the form of plague, during the hot &s;ea&s;on, and re-a&s;&s;umes the catarrhal and inflamma|tory form in the &s;ucceeding winter. The mea&s;les and influen|za, however, prevail at any &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>When I arrange epidemics under particular years, I &s;peak of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which extend over a whole country, or occur in ma|ny places. If we look into large cities, we &s;hall find &s;ome of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, almo&s;t every year. But my ob&s;ervations relate on|ly to tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es when they become general, or occur in vari|ous parts of a country in the &s;ame year.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="036687_0415_100AA41E5EBA45A0">When I place angina, plague and dy&s;entery again&s;t a particular year, it is not intended that the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es were all epidemic in the &s;ame place. Thus, while in 1793 the plague was in Phila|delphia, the &s;carlatina began to prevail in New-York and the we&s;|tern part of Connecticut. For it mu&s;t not be overlooked, that although mea&s;les and influenza appear nearly at the &s;ame time in all parts of the United States, yet the pe&s;tilential fevers that fol|low them fir&s;t &s;how them&s;elves in the larger cities in the &s;outhern latitudes. Thus the mea&s;les and influenza were univer&s;al in 1789 and 90, at lea&s;t this was the ca&s;e with the influenza; but the bili|ous plague broke out in New-York, Philadelphia and Charle&s;ton, before it did in Bo&s;ton and Newburyport. The &s;ame is ob&s;erva|ble in the other hemi&s;phere. The influenza &s;preads over A&s;ia, Europe and Africa, in a few weeks, but the following pe&s;tilence fir&s;t appears in Egypt or the Levant, or in Turkey, then in the northern parts of Europe. To the&s;e remarks there are few ex|ceptions.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o ob&s;ervable, that the pe&s;tilence in cities takes the form of petechial fever and plague; but in country towns, more gene|rally terminates in dy&s;entery.</P>
<P>It is a popular opinion that mea&s;les and &s;mall-pox never origi|nate in the human con&s;titution, without contagion. The palpable ab&s;urdity of &s;uch an opinion has not prevented its propagation and belief, among even well-informed men. So far is this opinion from truth, that the fir&s;t ca&s;es of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es in every epidemic period, are always generated in the human body, without conta|gion. When the condition of the elements is fitted to produce the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, they appear in all parts of a country, without con|tagion, they &s;pread rapidly, and decline when the general cau&s;es cea&s;e to operate. During this period, contagion is efficacious in propagating them, and no longer. When the condition of the elements is not fitted to produce them, if &s;poradic ca&s;es appear in particular habits of body, they will not always &s;pread the di&s;ea&s;es.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is here meant of the natural contagion of the di&s;ea&s;es from the breath and effluvia, which is not always efficacious in &s;preading them. The variolous matter of &s;mall-pox is excepted; for, if good, this will generally communicate the di&s;ea&s;e at any time.</NOTE> Sydenham long ago taught this truth, in de&s;cribing the changes

in the epidemics of 1670&mdash;1672. Mea&s;les and &s;mall-pox came and went with the &s;ea&s;ons and condition of the air.</P>
<P>The truth is, that certain conditions of the elements tend to produce <HI>eruptive di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> and before the practice of inoculation, the &s;mall pox was almo&s;t regularly one of that &s;eries of epidemics which I cla&s;s together, as of one family, and the precur&s;ors of plague. It is nearly allied to the mea&s;les, and appears u&s;ually about the &s;ame time. I am convinced that catarrh, mea&s;les, mild &s;mall-pox and whooping cough, are but varied forms of di&s;|ea&s;e, occa&s;ioned by modifications of the &s;ame elemental cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Certain it is, they are all predominant about the &s;ame time, and as a general remark, they <HI>precede</HI> the inva&s;ion of di&s;ea&s;es which bear the character of <HI>typhus.</HI></P>
<P>I have never conver&s;ed with a phy&s;ician who could not name in&s;tances of &s;mall-pox, originating without any known contagion, and generally medical gentlemen admit the di&s;ea&s;e to be generated in the con&s;titution. This principle is unque&s;tionably ju&s;t, and ought to be known, and received as truth; for the belief that con|tagion is nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of the di&s;ea&s;e, has produced mo&s;t mi&s;chievous con&s;equences. An in&s;tance happened in Shar|on a few years ago, in which a woman was &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox; but as &s;he had not been expo&s;ed to contagion, her di&s;ea&s;e was mi&s;taken, till ju&s;t before her death; and twenty or thirty per&s;ons were &s;uppo&s;ed to have taken the di&s;ea&s;e before the true nature of it was under&s;tood.</P>
<P>In the winter of 1797-8, occurred in Hartford two &s;poradic ca&s;es of mea&s;les, which could not po&s;&s;ibly be traced to contagion. At another time, a family was infected by means of a &s;tranger; but in neither of the&s;e ca&s;es was the di&s;ea&s;e propagated to others, who were expo&s;ed to the breath of the patients. See Dr. Cog&s;|well's letter, Med. Repo&s;. vol. 2. 301. Innumerable &s;imilar in|&s;tances may be mentioned.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner the various &s;pecies of angina and the plague occur in &s;poradic ca&s;es under the operation of powerful local and con&s;titutional cau&s;es, which, if not favored by the condition of the elements, will not &s;pread and become epidemic.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIV. Of the extent of a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air.</HEAD>
<P>FROM a view of the facts related in the preceding hi&s;tory, it appears that epidemics, agreeable to the definition already giv|en, are of two kinds&mdash;fir&s;t, tho&s;e which are limited to a particu|lar town, city or country; &s;econdly, tho&s;e which pervade whole quarters of the earth, or the whole globe. The fir&s;t may be called local, the la&s;t, general or univer&s;al epidemics.</P>
<P>The local epidemics, mo&s;t u&s;ual, are dy&s;entery, remitting and intermitting fevers, and pe&s;tilence. The epidemic, mo&s;t fre|quently univer&s;al, is the catarrh or influenza. Angina is often a general epidemic, &s;ometimes local. Pe&s;tilential fevers, in cer|tain periods become general over va&s;t tracts of the earth. The &s;ame is ob&s;ervable of the mea&s;les.</P>
<P>The epidemic catarrh is the di&s;order which mo&s;t deci&s;ively proves a rapid and univer&s;al change in the e&s;&s;ential properties of the atmo&s;phere. This di&s;ea&s;e &s;ometimes invades the human race &s;o &s;uddenly, that half the inhabitants of a town or city are &s;eiz|ed in a night. I do not find the &s;ame fact related of any other di&s;ea&s;e, except the &s;weating plague in 1529, who&s;e progre&s;s through Europe was as rapid nearly as that of the catarrh, and utterly precludes the &s;uppo&s;ition that infection from fomes, had any &s;hare in its propagation.</P>
<P>Catarrh however is not always a univer&s;al epidemic. In many in&s;tances, it is confined to one hemi&s;phere, as in 1647, 1655, to America; and in 1650, 1775, to Europe.</P>
<P>In other in&s;tances, this di&s;ea&s;e &s;preads over the whole world, in a &s;hort period, but is progre&s;&s;ive, appearing in the two hem|i&s;pheres, in two different years. Thus in 1761, it was epidemic in America; in 1762 in Europe.&mdash;In 1781 in America; in

1782 in Europe; in 1698 in America; in 1699 in Europe. In two or three in&s;tances, I find it in both hemi&s;pheres in the &s;ame year.</P>
<P>The compilers of the Encyclopedia &s;ay that catarrh from con|tagion has "&s;eldom appeared in any one country in Europe, with|out appearing &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in almo&s;t every different part of it; and in &s;ome in&s;tances, it has been al&s;o <HI>transferred</HI> to America, and has been <HI>&s;pread</HI> there, &s;o far as we have had opportunities of be|ing informed."</P>
<BIBL>See article, Medicine, No. 253, from Cullen.</BIBL>
<P>No &s;ource of errors, in the &s;cience of medicin, is more fruit|ful than the doctrin of contagion. It would &s;eem from the pa&s;|&s;age recited, that the writer con&s;idered catarrh as propagated by fomites from di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons; and conveyed acro&s;s the ocean by the &s;ick, or in goods or cloathing. The words will admit of no other interpretation; and yet it is hardly credible that, in this period of &s;cience and ob&s;ervation, an obvious and common phe|nomenon &s;hould be &s;o egregiou&s;ly mi&s;under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The catarrh, whenever it has appeared as a general epidemic, in&s;tead of being <HI>transferred</HI> to America, has u&s;ually appeared in America <HI>before</HI> it has in Europe or at the &s;ame time; and &s;o far is contagion from being the nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e of its origin and pro|pagation, that the di&s;ea&s;e invades &s;eamen on the ocean in the &s;ame hemi&s;phere, when a hundred leagues from land, at the &s;ame time that it invades people on &s;hore. Of this I have certain evi|dence from the te&s;timony of American Captains of ve&s;&s;els, who have been on their pa&s;&s;age from the continent to the We&s;t-India I&s;lands, during the prevalence of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>If further evidence is required, we have the fact, that the epi|demic catarrh in America rages with as much violence in the i&s;l|ands as on the continent, and at the &s;ame time. And in the preceding hi&s;tory, it is &s;tated on the authority of a medical publi|cation in Scotland, that the univer&s;al catarrh of 1733, appeared in the I&s;le of Bourbon, in the Indian Ocean, about the time it did in Europe.</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts, it is evident that the di&s;ea&s;e is occa&s;ioned by an alteration in the atmo&s;phere. In many in&s;tances it is limited to one hemi&s;phere; but it is ob&s;ervable, that whenever it appears
<PB N="64" REF="036687_0419_100AA422F6C08A60">
on the American continent, it appears al&s;o in the i&s;lands of the We&s;t-Indies. Its range is through a certain &s;ection of the globe, nearly in the &s;ame longitude, north and &s;outh, on one of the great divi&s;ions of the earth, and in the vicinity of the continent. The epidemic catarrh of America extends certainly from the northern limits of the United States to the i&s;land of Barbadoes. Whether it appears at the &s;ame time in South-America, I cannot find a hint in any author to guide my opinion, except in regard to the la&s;t epidemic, which pervaded that part of the continent.</P>
<P>The catarrh of 1733 extended over the globe, but it appeared fir&s;t in America. Po&s;&s;ibly there may have been other in&s;tances, &s;ince the &s;ettlement of America, but I have little information on this point, in regard to this country. It is not probable, for in|&s;tance, that the &s;evere catarrh of 1708-9, was confined to Eu|rope, but it is u&s;ele&s;s to indulge conjecture.</P>
<P>The remote cau&s;e u&s;ually a&s;&s;igned for catarrh is a &s;udden change of weather, from heat to cold or from cold to heat&mdash;the proxi|mate cau&s;e, an increa&s;ed afflux of fluids to the mucous membrane of the no&s;e, fances and bronchiae, with &s;ome degree of inflamma|tion. Some medical writers &s;eem to think the remote cau&s;e to be the application of cold only to the human body, checking the per&s;piration by the &s;kin, and turning the fluids upon the mucous membrane. See Cullen on this point.</P>
<P>The proximate cau&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e are the province of medi|cal men; but to the influence of the remote cau&s;e above &s;tated, phy&s;icians will pardon me for &s;tating a few objections.</P>
<P N="1">1. The application of cold to the body cannot be the &s;ole cau&s;e of catarrh, becau&s;e it appears, and u&s;ually with mo&s;t &s;everity, in the &s;pring, on the ab&s;traction of cold. It is ob&s;ervable al&s;o, that in many in&s;tances its principal violence and mortality, are, after the return of warm weather&mdash;the di&s;ea&s;e augmenting in violence with the increa&s;e of heat. Thus the catarrh of 1709 appeared in Italy, &s;ays Lanci&s;ius, in January in &s;evere cold weather, but increa&s;ed in violence, as the &s;pring advanced and the weather moderated.</P>
<P>The &s;ame fact took place in the catarrh of 1762 at Edinburgh, where it began in April and increa&s;ed in violence till June.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner, the catarrh in this country in 1790, ap|pearing in March and April, on the moderation of cold, was far
<PB N="65" REF="036687_0420_100AA3E7E1FE7038">
more &s;evere than that of the preceding autumn, when the weather was changing from heat to cold. At lea&s;t this was the fact in many of the northern &s;tates.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is not always true, that the epidemic catarrh appears in &s;pring or autumn, or after great changes of weather. The noted catarrh of 1580 began to appear in Sicily in the month of June; at Rome in July; at Venice and Con&s;tantinople in Augu&s;t&mdash;in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer. It is again&s;t all probability, that this di&s;|ea&s;e can be a&s;cribed to the application of cold. On the other hand, its progre&s;s was evidently &s;teady, and uninterrupted by ei|ther heat or cold&mdash;A careful attention to the hi&s;tory of this epi|demic at other times, will doubtle&s;s furni&s;h other &s;imilar facts.</P>
<P>The catarrh of 1688 &s;eized Germany in &s;ummer; that of 1557 appeared in Spain in Augu&s;t; that in America in 1655 began about the clo&s;e of June.</P>
<P N="3">3. The appearance of catarrh in tropical climates, as in the We&s;t-Indies, at the &s;ame time it appears in northern latitudes, is a &s;trong argument again&s;t a&s;cribing it to the application of cold. In the We&s;t-Indies there is no change of any great con&s;equence, in the temperature of the weather; nothing like <HI>cold</HI> is known in tho&s;e regions. Yet catarrh, if credible accounts are to be ad|mitted as evidence, is as fatal at times within the tropics, as in any other climate.</P>
<P>It is true, that in autumn winds called <HI>norths,</HI> northerly breezes, are experienced in the i&s;lands, and the&s;e produce colds and coughs &s;imilar to what we all experience, in temperate latitudes, on the change of weather in &s;pring and autumn. But the&s;e are very different, at lea&s;t in degree, from a general epidemic influenza, which &s;eizes mankind in all climates, with pain in the &s;ide and bones, accompanied often with fever. The univer&s;ality of this di&s;ea&s;e, bur&s;ting &s;uddenly upon all climates, and raging with equal violence in all &s;ea&s;ons, and in defiance of heat or cold, leave us no room to que&s;tion its dependence on &s;ome other cau&s;e than changes of weather or application of cold.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the application of cold was the &s;ole cau&s;e of this epidem|ic, it would appear at the &s;ame time in all places which experience a &s;udden change from heat to cold at the &s;ame time. And fur|ther,
<PB N="66" REF="036687_0421_100AA42484D60980">
a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence would be, it mu&s;t be epidemic on every &s;uch change. Neither of the&s;e ca&s;es occurs. On the other hand, the di&s;ea&s;e begins indifferently in any climate and in any &s;ea&s;on of the year, and &s;preads &s;peedily over whole countries, with|out the lea&s;t ob&s;truction from heat or cold: And as far as I can ob&s;erve from the accounts of it before me, it is as mortal when it invades people in hot climates, as in cold or temperate regions and &s;ea&s;ons. It is al&s;o progre&s;&s;ive in point of place; but it moves with a celerity unknown to all other di&s;ea&s;es. Sometimes it pa&s;|&s;es over Europe in &s;ix weeks. In America, its duration in 1789 and in 1790, was nearly the &s;ame. Different epidemics, how|ever, differ in the rapidity of their movements: That of 1580 was about &s;ix months in traver&s;ing Europe.</P>
<P>Different epidemics al&s;o differ in point of generality and vio|lence. Sometimes the catarrh is a light complaint; at other times it is attended with fever, and occa&s;ions no incon&s;iderable mortality. The catarrh in the &s;pring of 1790, was much more &s;evere than that of the autumn preceding. In 1789, it re&s;em|bled a &s;evere and univer&s;al cold&mdash;in 1790, it bordered more on the pleuri&s;y and peripneumony. To the&s;e remarks there may have been particular exceptions.</P>
<P N="5">5. It appears to me al&s;o, that, with deference to the faculty, a &s;trong argument again&s;t deriving the di&s;ea&s;e from &s;udden chan|ges of weather only, may be drawn from a difference in the &s;ymp|toms of an epidemic influenza and of &s;poradic ca&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e, obviou&s;ly contracted by cold. Let me a&s;k practitioners, whether in the epidemic catarrh, there do not appear &s;ymptoms altogether unknown in &s;poradic ca&s;es? But as this is a point that regards practice, it is not proper for me to di&s;cu&s;s it.</P>
<P>The celebrated Boyle very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves that &s;udden epidem|ic colds, are not to be accounted for by changes of weather. Vol. 5, p. 49.</P>
<P>I do not, however, deny the influence of heat and cold in the epidemic catarrh. In &s;ome violent epidemics of this &s;ort, heat and cold &s;eem to have little influence&mdash;the di&s;ea&s;e appearing to rage, independent of all the &s;en&s;ible qualities of the air. Yet in ordinary ca&s;es, the temperature of the air &s;eems to <HI>modify,</HI> but not to <HI>generate</HI> or <HI>de&s;troy</HI> the epidemic.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="036687_0422_100AA3E9670BA6B8">Brown, in his elements of medicin, arranges catarrh among di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;tenic diathe&s;is. Whether he meant to extend his ob&s;ervation to &s;poradic ca&s;es from cold only, or to the influen|za al&s;o, I do not know; but it may not be improper in me to mention, that in many epidemics of this &s;ort, bleeding has proved injurious or fatal. The mo&s;t generally &s;ucce&s;sful remedies have been the diaphoretic, although there have been a few exceptions, in which bleeding was &s;alutary. Indeed no di&s;ea&s;e &s;eems to ad|mit of a greater diver&s;ity of &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>Next to the catarrh, in the li&s;t of general epidemics, we may perhaps arrange the mea&s;les, which, though &s;ometimes a local di&s;|ea&s;e, often appears over whole countries, and &s;ometimes in both hemi&s;pheres at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e is attended with &s;pecific contagion, which aids its communication from place to place; but it derives its origin from a particular &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere. Hence it appears in one &s;ea&s;on and di&s;appears in another, yielding to &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;e, as Sydenham remarked in the year 1672, and which we ob&s;erved in New-York in 1795. It is nearly allied to the catarrh as is evident from the catarrhous &s;ymptoms that attend it. Brown cla&s;&s;es the mea&s;les in the number of &s;tenic di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>It will be found on examining the hi&s;tory of di&s;ea&s;es, that the mea&s;les u&s;ually <HI>precedes</HI> or <HI>follows</HI> an epidemic influenza. The two di&s;ea&s;es therefore manife&s;t a clo&s;e alliance in the remote cau&s;es.</P>
<P>My accounts of epidemics are too imperfect to authorize the a&s;&s;ertion, that the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es <HI>always</HI> appear nearly together; but this has been the fact, with re&s;pect to a number of the la&s;t epi|demic periods in America. The order however is varied. Sometimes al&s;o a &s;light degree of one or both of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es is experienced in particular places, when neither of them is epidemic. But when they become violent and general, they are nearly co|temporaneous, &s;preading &s;ucce&s;&s;ively over a large portion of the earth, and &s;ometimes over both hemi&s;pheres.</P>
<P>In 1772 the catarrh and mea&s;les raged in the &s;ame year, from Bo&s;ton to Charle&s;ton. To the&s;e &s;ucceeded anginas and dy&s;ente|ry, for a &s;eries of years. In 1781 and 2 catarrh pervaded the
<PB N="68" REF="036687_0423_100AA4271306A6B8">
globe. In 1783 began mea&s;les in May, and angina in Augu&s;t. In 1789 mea&s;les preceded the influenza. In 1757 influenza preceded the mea&s;les.</P>
<P>An epidemic which u&s;ed formerly to make a figure in medical hi&s;tory, as one nearly cotemporary with mea&s;les, was the &s;mall-pox. The di&s;ea&s;e was ob&s;erved by Sydenham, to rage alternate|ly with mea&s;les in different &s;ea&s;ons of the year. Like the mea|&s;les, it is an eruptive di&s;ea&s;e, of the &s;tenic &s;pecies &s;pecifically con|tagious, and evidently depending on the &s;ame general cau&s;e, though on different temporary or local cau&s;es. Inoculation has nearly bani&s;hed this from the li&s;t of epidemics.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a common error that this di&s;ea&s;e never originates without contagion. Before the art of inoculation, it was an epidemic in large cities, appearing and di&s;appearing with as much regularity and certainty as the mea&s;les. I can name many in&s;tances of its originating in this country without contagion or infection, and I have the authority of many old practitioners of medicin for the fact. It mo&s;t u&s;ually ap|pears in tho&s;e years which manife&s;t a di&s;po&s;ition to produce other erup|tive di&s;ea&s;es.</NOTE></P>
<P>But a more formidable epidemic, and perhaps the mo&s;t formi|dable to which the human race is expo&s;ed, is the angina, u&s;ing this word to denote all the different kinds of affections of the throat. I call it the mo&s;t formidable, becau&s;e hitherto no means have been di&s;covered of arre&s;ting its progre&s;s. Its horrors and fatality are not mitigated by inoculation, like tho&s;e of the &s;mall-pox, nor are its u&s;ual ravages limited to populous towns, like tho&s;e of the plague. Under all a&s;pects, therefore, I con&s;ider it as a far more dreadful di&s;ea&s;e than either, becau&s;e the others may be mitigated or avoided.</P>
<P>Affections of the throat, either in the form of &s;carlatina angi|no&s;a, angina maligna, cynanche trachealis, &amp;c. are among the epi|demics which belong to almo&s;t every pe&s;tilential period. In the order of appearance they have not one uniform place; but in America, anginas have u&s;ually &s;ucceeded catarrh, the fir&s;t or &s;e|cond year, and continued to the fourth or fifth. In the three la&s;t epidemic periods, this order has been very uniform. I &s;peak of epidemic angina which &s;preads over the whole country; for in particular places we hear of it almo&s;t every year.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es in our large cities have been &s;ucceeded by the
<PB N="69" REF="036687_0424_100AA3EBA37F5F30">
bilious plague, and in the country, by violent remittents, typhus fevers and dy&s;entery.</P>
<P>Sometimes angina prevails without being followed by the plague: That is, the con&s;titution of air terminates at that point of its pe&s;tilential progre&s;s. Such &s;eems to have been the fact with the angina of 1755. And in all ca&s;es in which it is of a mild kind, or not univer&s;al, &s;trong hopes may be entertained, that no plague will follow it. The epidemic anginas from 1783 to 1786, were of this kind.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the univer&s;ality of the cau&s;e of the&s;e epidemics, it is to be ob&s;erved, that it is of two kinds&mdash;&s;ometimes it extends to both hemi&s;pheres, at other times it &s;eems to be limited to one. Tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, however, which are lea&s;t influenced by heat or cold, or which depend mo&s;t on &s;ome invi&s;ible &s;tate of the atmo&s;|phere, appear mo&s;t frequently in both hemi&s;pheres, at the &s;ame time. This fact, with re&s;pect to the catarrh, has been particular|ly noticed.</P>
<P>The &s;ame fact is ob&s;ervable very often with re&s;pect to the mea|&s;les, and e&s;pecially with regard to anginas. The&s;e affections of the throat, when violent, are nearly cotemporary in Europe and America. Witne&s;s the periods from 1751 to 1756&mdash;from 1773 to 1776&mdash;1783 to 1786&mdash;from 1793 to 1796, and in 1742.</P>
<P>This cotemporaneou&s;ne&s;s of certain epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, in both hemi&s;pheres, is an important fact which has hitherto been little noticed, but which opens a new field for philo&s;ophical inve&s;tiga|tion. It demon&s;trates that &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es are occa&s;ioned &s;olely by a con&s;titution of air, without the influence of contagion, although when the di&s;ea&s;es are formed, they are contagious.</P>
<P>But we have further facts of a &s;imilar nature. It is ob&s;ervable that the pe&s;tilential principle often extends from Egypt, Syria and Turkey, over all Europe and to America. But the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es, that is, the &s;ame forms of the pe&s;tilence, do not always appear in Egypt or Turkey, and in France, England and America, in the &s;ame year. It is a general fact, that the wor&s;t form of pe&s;tilence, the inguinal plague, appears fir&s;t in Cairo, Smyrna or Con&s;tanti|nople; and from this circum&s;tance, the advocates for the propa|gation of that di&s;ea&s;e by &s;pecific contagion, have drawn their mo&s;t
<PB N="70" REF="036687_0425_100AA429E46BD658">
powerful arguments in &s;upport of their theory. But this argu|ment is founded on a view of the &s;ubject, mo&s;t mi&s;erably narrow and ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>In every pe&s;tilential period, there is a &s;eries of epidemic di&s;|ea&s;es. The order in which they appear depends on local or tem|porary circum&s;tances. Thus in Grand Cairo or Con&s;tantinople, the climate or the &s;trong local cau&s;es, &s;peedily bring the pe&s;tilen|tial principle to its cri&s;is, in the production of the plague. For this rea&s;on, that di&s;ea&s;e appears in tho&s;e cities, &s;ome time <HI>before</HI> it does in northern latitudes or in more healthy cities.</P>
<P>But at the very time the plague appears in Con&s;tantinople or Cairo, &s;ome lighter epidemic di&s;ea&s;e, belonging to the &s;eries, ap|pears in other parts of the world, indicating the approach of pe&s;|tilence. Thus, in 1580 and 81, Cairo was de&s;olated by a hid|eous plague; but, at the &s;ame time, a &s;evere epidemic catarrh bur&s;t forth on all Europe, the certain forerunner of pe&s;tilential fe|vers, and which, in that in&s;tance, was &s;ucceeded by plague in 1582 and 3, as far north as England. Let facts within late pe|riods, decide this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The plague appeared in the Turki&s;h dominions in 1718, but in 1719 became more general. In 1718 the bills of mortality were con&s;iderably &s;welled in Am&s;terdam, London and Vienna, but in 1719 they ro&s;e, in the two former cities, con&s;iderably higher&mdash;the pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air pervading the mo&s;t of Europe. I have no account of the &s;tate of di&s;ea&s;es in Mar&s;eilles, in 1718; but in 1719 appeared a pe&s;tilential fever, which increa&s;ed the mortality, altho the pe&s;tilential principle did not ri&s;e to its height till the &s;ub&s;equent year.</P>
<P>In this period, cotemporary with the plague in the Levant, was a univer&s;al increa&s;e of mortality in Europe, and the &s;ame &s;tate of air was experienced in America, altho, in very few parts of Europe, did the pe&s;tilential principle ari&s;e to the degree of plague.</P>
<P>In 1726 we again hear of the plague in Egypt, and for two or three years &s;ucceeding, the bills of mortality were &s;welled in Europe and America. Of the epidemics that prevailed in A|merica, I regret my want of information.&mdash;I only know that mea&s;les and malignant pleuri&s;y prevailed in this country.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="036687_0426_100AA3ED2D15AFE0">In 1735 and 6 raged the mo&s;t de&s;olating &s;ore throat in Ameri|ca, and at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t fatal plague in Egypt, that has appeared in this century. This pe&s;tilence, like that in the time of Thucydides, took its ri&s;e in the interior parts of Egypt or Ethiopia. And it mu&s;t not be overlooked that the violence of the pe&s;tilence in Egypt corre&s;ponded with that of the &s;ore throat in America&mdash;a fact which, as far as I can di&s;cover, is gen|erally true, that the more fatal the epidemics that prevail over one quarter of the globe, the more violent are the &s;ame or other pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, in the other hemi&s;phere. It makes little dif|ference, that in one country rages the glandular plague, and in another the petechial fever or putrid &s;ore throat&mdash;The&s;e are only different forms of pe&s;tilence, the <HI>effects of one common cau&s;e, modi|fied by local cau&s;es.</HI> The great point is, that &s;uch epidemics are <HI>cotemporary in countries the mo&s;t remote.</HI> Slight epidemics may appear alone, but never the more &s;evere and deadly forms of pe&s;|tilence; excepting perhaps dy&s;entery, or &s;ome other complaints that depend mo&s;tly on the &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>The years 1740-41 and 42 were al&s;o pe&s;tilential. At what time the plague of this period fir&s;t appeared in the ea&s;t, I am not informed. But it raged in Syria from 1742 to 1744, and it rarely happens, that it is not a year or two earlier in Egypt or Con&s;tantinople, than in Syria. Cotemporary with the plague of this period was great mortality in London and Am&s;terdam from the petechial fever, which fell but little &s;hort of the plague. See the bills.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, raged in America a &s;eries of epidemics, particularly mea&s;les, anginas and the bilious plague; the latter ap|pearing in Philadelphia and Virginia in 1741, and in N. York in 1743, the &s;ame year with the dreadful pe&s;tilence in Me&s;&s;ina.</P>
<P>The year 1755, the year of a great plague in Con&s;tantinople, was di&s;tingui&s;hed for catarrh in Europe, and &s;ore throat both in Europe and America.</P>
<P>In 1758 commenced the pe&s;tilential period, which was univer|&s;al and felt in both hemi&s;pheres, in &s;ome one or all of the years from 1758 to 1763. Here, it is ob&s;ervable, our information is more correct. In 1758, cotemporary with the beginning of this
<PB N="72" REF="036687_0427_100AA42C53098518">
pe&s;tilence, was an epidemic catarrh in Europe. Then followed other epidemics of a more malignant type. During this pe&s;tilen|tial period appeared in America, the catarrh and mea&s;les, and the plague in Philadelphia in 1762; but e&s;pecially the fatal epidemic pleuri&s;y in 1761.</P>
<P>The next period commenced in 1769 or 1770, in which the plague &s;pread over the ea&s;t. This period was begun by mea&s;les and anginas, if my information is correct, in 1769&mdash;catarrh was epidemic in 1771 and 2, and in the latter year mea&s;les of a bad type. Then followed angina, and the epidemics all clo&s;ed in dy&s;enteries. The plague in the Levant was cotemporary with the commencement of this period.</P>
<P>I am not informed of the preci&s;e time when the plague of the next period commenced in the Levant, but it was raging in 1783 and 4, during the prevalence of mea&s;les and angina in America.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t period, the plague in Egypt was very violent, about the time the mortality commenced in America. Of the preci&s;e time when it began in Egypt I am not informed; but it prevailed in 1791, the year it appeared in New-York and Grenada, and was mo&s;t de&s;tructive the following year, 1792, the year when the &s;carlatina fir&s;t appeared in the northern parts of America.</P>
<P>I have no further accounts of the plague in Egypt, but the public prints have informed us, the di&s;ea&s;e prevailed in Con&s;tan|tinople in 1797, and was more general in the Turki&s;h dominions in 1798, the mo&s;t fatal year in America.</P>
<P>The reader will be plea&s;ed to remark, that when I &s;peak of the plague in Grand Cairo or Con&s;tantinople, I refer only to vi|olent and de&s;tructive epidemics. The plague, in a light form, and in a few ca&s;es, occurs almo&s;t annually in tho&s;e great cities, where the common cau&s;es and ordinary &s;ea&s;ons are adequate to its production in particular con&s;titutions. But, let me ob&s;erve, that no exten&s;ive and de&s;olating plague ever ravages either of tho&s;e cities, except under the influence of general contagion, or an epidemic &s;tate of air, which is experienced, nearly at the &s;ame time, in Europe and America.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts enable us to &s;olve the whole difficulty which has puzzled phy&s;icians, in regard to the different kinds of yellow
<PB N="73" REF="036687_0428_100AA3F0AE356820">
fever, which appear, at different periods, in the We&s;t-Indies. The &s;imple truth, is, that in ordinary &s;ea&s;ons, when no pe&s;tilen|tial con&s;titution of air exi&s;ts, the fever of the We&s;t-Indies, is not contagious. It attacks &s;trangers with violence and de&s;troys life, but is not communicable <HI>per &s;e.</HI> Hence the authors who have written on the &s;ubject are correct, in a&s;&s;erting this ordinary fever, not to be contagious.</P>
<P>But after catarrh has pervaded the hemi&s;phere, and during the increa&s;e of mortality in the Levant, in Europe and on the Amer|ican continent; that is, during a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air, the fe|ver of the We&s;t-Indies a&s;&s;umes double malignity, and becomes contagious. In years of health, the di&s;ea&s;e rarely attacks natives of the i&s;lands; but in unhealthy periods, not only native whites, but even blacks are &s;ometimes affected with the di&s;ea&s;e. Among the&s;e however it is le&s;s de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;olve the problem which has embarra&s;&s;ed all the med|ical writers on the yellow fever, the mo&s;t able of whom have been compelled to declare that the fever in the I&s;lands is &s;ometimes contagious, and at other times, not.</P>
<P>This view of the &s;ubject would have prevented the trouble of authors who have labored to prove the di&s;ea&s;e imported from Siam, or the African coa&s;t.&mdash;Dr. Chi&s;holm, in&s;tead of attempting to trace the Grenada fever of 1793 to Africa, through the &s;hip Hankey, had only to remark, the prevalence of the catarrh in 1790, of the plague in Egypt in 1791, and of the &s;carlatina in the United States in 1793, and he would have &s;een the begin|ning of a mo&s;t exten&s;ive and malignant &s;eries of di&s;ea&s;es. The truth is, the pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air fir&s;t manife&s;ted it&s;elf in Gre|nada in 1791, [the year it commenced in New-York] by new and &s;ingular &s;ymptoms, which &s;urpri&s;ed Dr. Chi&s;holm. And this, by the way, was before the beginning of the pre&s;ent war, on the part of Great-Britain, and of cour&s;e, it could not be a&s;|cribed to that circum&s;tance. The &s;ame fact, when ju&s;tly con&s;id|ered, is demon&s;tration, that the di&s;ea&s;e was not brought from Africa.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remarked however, that the fever of the tropical
<PB N="74" REF="036687_0429_100AA42DDAFC37E8">
climates, though not contagious in &s;poradic ca&s;es, in healthful years, may at any time become epidemic and contagious, under certain circum&s;tances. Thus large bodies of &s;oldiers and &s;ea|men, pa&s;&s;ing &s;uddenly from high northern latitudes into the We&s;t-Indies, may contract the di&s;ea&s;e, and render it &s;o virulent by crou|ded camps and &s;hips, as to render it very infectious. This is u&s;u|ally the ca&s;e in wars between England and France, which call great numbers of men from Great-Britain into the i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Yet even in this ca&s;e, the mortality of the di&s;ea&s;e is increa&s;ed by a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air, concurring with &s;uch local cau&s;es. Such was the &s;tate of air from 1760 to 1763, during which the Briti&s;h and American troops peri&s;hed before Havanna. Such al&s;o has been the &s;tate of air for eight years pa&s;t, in which the de|&s;truction of the Briti&s;h troops in the i&s;lands has been unparralleled.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance has led a re&s;pectable college of phy&s;icians in Philadelphia, to in&s;inuate that war is a cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. Their words are, "it exi&s;ts in the We&s;t-Indies, particularly in time of war, when great numbers of &s;trangers are to be found there, and reference to dates will &s;how, that in <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of the in&s;tan|ces of the occurrence of the di&s;ea&s;e in the United States, there has been war in the We&s;t-Indies." Memorial to the Legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania, Dec. 5, 1797.</P>
<P>This a&s;&s;ertion, however, is not authorized by facts. The de|plorable plague in Philadelphia and Charle&s;ton in 1699, was in time of peace. That in New-York in 1702 was in the fir&s;t year of a war, but could not have been derived from that circum&s;tance, in &s;o &s;hort a time.</P>
<P>The &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e at Barbadoes and Martinico, in 1723, was in time of peace, in Charle&s;ton in 1728, in time of peace&mdash;at Carthagena the next year, in time of peace&mdash;at Charle&s;ton and New-York in 1732, in time of peace&mdash;at Barbadoes in 1738 and 1764, in time of peace. The in&s;tances which happened between 1740 and 48, were in time of war, as was that in Philadelphia in 1762. The pre&s;ent war has exhibited melancholy effects of di&s;ea&s;es in the We&s;t-Indies; but it is an indubitable fact that the plague of the pre&s;ent period commenced in 1791, a year before the war, and before numerous reinforcements of troops had been
<PB N="75" REF="036687_0430_100AA3F46EFA0428">
&s;ent to the i&s;lands. It mu&s;t further be ob&s;erved, that during the eight years war between America and Great-Britain, no yellow fever appeared in the United States! a &s;triking fact.</P>
<P>It is certainly a mo&s;t unfortunate circum&s;tance for the credit of the college of phy&s;icians, that the longe&s;t interval of peace during the pre&s;ent century, from the treaty of Utrecht in 1713, to the Spani&s;h war of 1740, includes in it the longe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;evere &s;tate of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, in Europe, Africa, America and the I&s;lands, that has occurred, during the century. A &s;imple in|&s;pection of the bills of mortality, during that period, will demon|&s;trate the fact!</P>
<P>One thing, however, may be a&s;&s;erted with truth, that whatever may be the extent and violence of the bilious plague in the We&s;t-Indies, it never has appeared in the northern parts of the United States, except in periods when a pe&s;tilential or &s;ickly &s;tate of the air is manife&s;ted by the prevalence of other epidemics. In tro|pical climates and in the &s;outhern parts of America, particular circum&s;tances, as great bodies of fre&s;h troops from northern lati|tudes, or unfavorable &s;ea&s;ons, may generate the di&s;ea&s;e in any year, however healthy in temperate latitudes. But from Mary|land northward, this American plague has never appeared with|out being preceded by other epidemics. Let facts be re&s;orted to for confirmation.</P>
<P>We read of malignant di&s;ea&s;es in America, anterior to the year 1699, but the order of them is not de&s;cribed. The fatal plague of that year was preceded by epidemic catarrh, and the plague raged, at the &s;ame time, in the Levant. The &s;ame di&s;|ea&s;e in New-York in 1702, belongs to the &s;ame period, which &s;eems to have commenced in 1697 and ended in 1702.</P>
<P>The next &s;ickly period was from 1709 to 1713, beginning in Europe with the &s;evere catarrh of 1709, which was followed by plague in the Baltic towns, in Hungary, Vienna, &amp;c. accom|panied with a mo&s;t de&s;olating &s;ickne&s;s among horned cattle and hor&s;es, in Germany and Italy. Of the effects of this con&s;titu|tion of air, in America, I have but two in&s;tances, which were a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ickne&s;s in Waterbury, in Connecticut, which almo&s;t depopulated the town, and epidemic mea&s;les in 1712.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="036687_0431_100AA42F81E9C6D0">Of the next pe&s;tilential period, about 1720, I have al&s;o but two in&s;tances in America; the mortality at Duck creek, as al|ready related, and the malignant pleuri&s;y in Hartford.</P>
<P>The plague in Philadelphia and Virginia in 1741, and in New-York in 1743, was preceded by the u&s;ual epidemics, in|fluenza, mea&s;les, angina, &amp;c. and at the &s;ame time the plague was raging in the Levant and in Sicily.</P>
<P>The &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e in Philadelphia in 1762 had its u&s;ual precur|&s;ors, mea&s;les and catarrh, and this occurred during the prevalence of the plague, in the Levant.</P>
<P>I hardly need to mention, in proof, the pre&s;ent epidemics. It is well known, we have pa&s;&s;ed through the whole &s;eries of precur&s;ors, catarrh, &s;carlatina, mea&s;les, &amp;c. the two former be|ing far more general and &s;evere than u&s;ual, indicated, with in|fallible certainty, the violence and extent of the plague which was to follow.</P>
<P>From a long &s;eries of facts, then, we demon&s;trate that the plague of our climate depends on &s;ome <HI>general cau&s;e.</HI> And it mu&s;t aba&s;h and confound the &s;ticklers for the propagation of this di&s;ea&s;e from country to country by fomes, to know that the di&s;|ea&s;e never occurs in the temperate latitudes of America, except under a pe&s;tilential con&s;titution of air, manife&s;ted by other ma|lignant di&s;ea&s;es in this country, which are certainly <HI>not</HI> imported, and during al&s;o the prevalence of &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;es in the Levant, and an increa&s;e of mortality in other countries. It mu&s;t &s;till more confound the&s;e per&s;ons, if they have any &s;u&s;ceptibility of conviction, to ob&s;erve that the&s;e very pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, in&s;tead of being conveyed from place to place, appear at one and the &s;ame time in Egypt, Turkey, the We&s;t-Indies, and in the Uni|ted States. This is very common, and probably is always the fact.</P>
<P>If the pe&s;tilence were introduced into this country, from the i&s;lands, and if the di&s;ea&s;e is capable of being propagated as an epidemic, from fomes, why, let me a&s;k, has it never been prop|agated in the United States, in healthy periods? It has been <HI>imported</HI> probably in hundreds of in&s;tances, from the i&s;lands, ever &s;ince the commencement of the We&s;t-India trade.</P>
<P>Not a year pa&s;&s;ed from 1763 to 1791, in which multitudes of
<PB N="77" REF="036687_0432_100AA3F5F88F62A8">
&s;eamen or pe&s;&s;engers were not brought into the United States, in|to large and &s;mall towns, and into ho&s;pitals filled with patients, with the yellow fever upon them and all their infected clothing. Yet in all this long period, no contagion appeared, altho no pre|cautions, at lea&s;t in many parts of the country, were ever taken to prevent it. If the di&s;ea&s;e contains &s;pecific contagion, &s;urely that contagion mu&s;t take effect under all circum&s;tances. Every man knows that the variolous matter of the &s;mall-pox regards neither time nor place; its contagion acts in all years, &s;ea&s;ons and climates, tho not with equal certainty.</P>
<P>This fact alone, that the bilious plague never &s;hows it&s;elf in the temperate latitudes of America, except when the current epi|demics of this country, manife&s;t a general con&s;titution of air, unfriendly to health, is &s;ufficient to explain all the difficulties that have occured to medical men and to others, on the &s;ubject of the origin and peculiar &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e remarks are in anticipation of the &s;ubject of a|nother &s;ection, but they fall naturally enough under this head, the de&s;ign of which is, to e&s;tabli&s;h the doctrin of the univer&s;ali|ty of certain di&s;ea&s;es, at particular times, occa&s;ioned by a cau&s;e or cau&s;es extending often over a whole hemi&s;phere, and &s;ometimes over the earth.&mdash;That &s;uch is the fact, is demon&s;trated by the hi&s;tory of epidemics, from the earlie&s;t ages to this day. A &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive &s;eries of &s;imilar facts, occurring age after age, leave no room for cavil or controver&s;y.</P>
<P>I have confined my remarks, on this head, to the late&s;t periods of the world, becau&s;e the evidence is more complete. But a &s;imple in&s;pection of the preceding hi&s;tory, will convince any can|did per&s;on, that the phenomena of pe&s;tilence have been uniform, from the highe&s;t antiquity. In the mo&s;t barbarous ages, when commerce was unknown, all the &s;evere plagues appeared in al|mo&s;t every part of the earth, in high northern latitudes, and a|mong &s;avage tribes which had no intercour&s;e with the Mediterra|nean. The cu&s;tom of deriving all plagues from Egypt, Syria or Turkey by &s;pecific contagion, is modern&mdash;it is pointedly contra|dicted by all hi&s;tory&mdash;is unworthy of the enlightened period in which it has been advanced&mdash;and marks an extreme degeneration in philo&s;ophy.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XV. Of the phenomena which attend pe&s;tilential periods, with conjectures concerning the cau&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>IT will not e&s;cape the mo&s;t inattentive reader of the foregoing hi&s;tory, that all the violent and general plagues have been prece|ded or accompanied with remarkable phenomena in the phy&s;ical world, as comets, earthquakes, explo&s;ions of volcanoes, and oth|ers of a &s;ubordinate kind.</P>
<P>We are to admit, with great caution, the influence of the plan|ets in producing the calamitous di&s;ea&s;es which at periods afflict mankind. It is an influence very uncertain and undefinable. It is not indeed unphilo&s;ophical to &s;uppo&s;e, the &s;everal immen&s;e orbs that compo&s;e the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, to have an influence on each other by means of the great laws of attraction and repul&s;ion. The con|trary &s;uppo&s;ition would be mo&s;t unphilo&s;ophical. But it might be very difficult to a&s;certain preci&s;ely what that influence is, be|cau&s;e it might not be po&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate its effects from tho&s;e which are produced by other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The ancients went much too far in a&s;cribing events on this earth to planetary influence. They a&s;cribed not only natural, but moral effects to that influence, and by their extravagant &s;y&s;tem of judicial a&s;trology, brought into contempt the &s;tudy of the influ|ence of heavenly bodies.</P>
<P>We are not however to di&s;card all con&s;iderations of &s;uch an influence. We are naturally led to &s;uppo&s;e that all parts of our &s;y&s;tem are connected by principles of attraction, and that a cer|tain order and equilibrium are nece&s;&s;ary to keep all parts in due harmony. It is very obvious that the moon has a mo&s;t material influence in regulating the &s;ea&s;ons and changes of weather on this
<PB N="79" REF="036687_0434_100AA3F928127410">
globe, e&s;pecially the weekly and monthly vici&s;&s;itudes. The more di&s;tant bodies may have a &s;imilar effect, tho le&s;s obvious.</P>
<P>Comets, which approach and enter the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem at certain unequal periods, may al&s;o have &s;ome influence upon the &s;ea&s;ons. To a&s;certain this point, I have collected all the information my reading has enabled me to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>The ancients believed the&s;e bodies to be the cau&s;es or at lea&s;t the harbingers of pe&s;tilence; according to that line of Claudian</P>
<LG>
<L>"In coelo nunquam &s;pectatum impun&eacute; cometam."</L>
<L>"A comet in the heavens is never beheld with impunity."</L>
</LG>
<P>But &s;hould the fact be admitted, it might be &s;till a &s;ubject of enquiry, by what means the&s;e erratic bodies injure the health of mankind. That they have &s;ome effect of this kind, &s;eems to be very probable, not only from the opinion of the ancients who were careful in their ob&s;ervations, but from the very uniform co|incidence of their appearance with exten&s;ive pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>It is certain that comets have a very &s;en&s;ible effect on the weather. This was ob&s;erved as long ago as the days of Ari&s;|totle, who remarks, Meteorol. lib. 1. ca. 7. "That comets denote great tides and winds." He in&s;tances the &s;well of the &s;ea when Achaia was inundated, which was during the appear|ance of a comet. Pliny makes a &s;imilar ob&s;ervation. "Ventos autem ab iis graves ae&s;tu&s;que &s;ignifica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i." Nat. Hi&s;t. lib. 2. ca. 25. Seneca was of the &s;ame opinion, and he mentions &s;torms of rain al&s;o among the effects of their approach. Seneca, Nat. Qu&s;t. lib. 7. &s;ect. 28.</P>
<P>It is true that great heat and drouth, and violent tempe&s;ts mark the periods of the approach of comets, and it is equally true that the winters of the &s;ame periods are remarkably cold. Ari&s;totle him&s;elf mentions the cold of the winter, during the appearance of the great comet, when Ari&s;taeus was archon at Athens.</P>
<P>The preceding relation of facts furni&s;hes a confirmation of the&s;e opinions. All the comets which have approached this earth, in their pa&s;&s;age to or from the &s;un, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which have pa&s;&s;ed very near us, have been preceded, attended and fol|lowed by mo&s;t extraordinary effects, as great heat and drouth,
<PB N="80" REF="036687_0435_100AA43419D8CA70">
in &s;ummer, and &s;evere cold in winter; deluging rains, violent tempe&s;ts and unu&s;ual tides. The&s;e we may con&s;ider as the con|&s;tant and certain attendants on comets. They occur &s;o uniform|ly with the appearance of tho&s;e bodies, and for &s;ome months preceding and following, as to leave no room to que&s;tion the in|fluence from which they proceed.</P>
<P>Through the medium of &s;uch great changes in the &s;ea&s;ons, we may rationally &s;uppo&s;e comets mu&s;t affect the health of man|kind. Extreme and unu&s;ual heat &s;eldom fails to produce a mul|titude of autumnal di&s;ea&s;es, as may be &s;een by the bills of mor|tality, and as the ob&s;ervations of every per&s;on can verify.</P>
<P>It is obvious from the foregoing hi&s;tory, that one of the mo&s;t certain effects of the approximation of a comet, is, a mo&s;t &s;evere winter. The almo&s;t uniform coincidence of the&s;e two phenon|ena leaves us no room to doubt their connection. Now it is a law of the &s;ea&s;ons, that the mean temperature of the air is nearly the &s;ame every year. This has been proved by &s;even years ob|&s;ervations made at Salem by Dr. Holyoke, and publi&s;hed in the fir&s;t part of the &s;econd volume of the Memoirs of the American Academy. Whenever therefore the cold of winter is long or &s;evere in an unu&s;ual degree, it mu&s;t be counterbalanced, in the &s;ucceeding &s;ea&s;ons, by an extraordinary degree of heat. This may happen to be effected by long mild weather in &s;pring and autumn; but it is more u&s;ual, that &s;evere winters are followed by exce&s;&s;ive heat in the &s;ummer months. In this ca&s;e, the hu|man body never fails to &s;uffer. In &s;uch &s;ummers, bilious fevers and dy&s;enteries are commonly numerous and violent.</P>
<P>If therefore comets do in fact produce unu&s;ually cold winters, which are nece&s;&s;arily preceded or followed by exce&s;&s;ively hot &s;ummers, they may be con&s;idered as the remote cau&s;e of nume|rous di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>But comets do mo&s;t evidently occa&s;ion at times exce&s;&s;ive drouth; and at other times, extraordinary quantities of rain; and the&s;e intemperate &s;ea&s;ons not unfrequently &s;ucceed each other within a few months. No man can que&s;tion this fact, who at|tends to the preceding hi&s;tory. All &s;uch unu&s;ual &s;ea&s;ons are apt to injure the vegetable kingdom. In too dry &s;ea&s;ons, corn may
<PB N="81" REF="036687_0436_100AA3FAAF58C210">
be defective in quantity; in too wet weather, it is deficient in nouri&s;hing qualities; and in both ca&s;es, it may contain the germs of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>That comets &s;hould affect the health of mankind in any other way, than through the means of the &s;ea&s;ons or weather, is po&s;&s;i|ble; but is not to be admitted without mo&s;t indi&s;putable evi|dence. It is indeed certain that the oriental nations believe, and have, from high antiquity, believed the&s;e bodies to be the fore|runners of plagues; and the enumeration of facts in the forego|ing hi&s;tory, evidently confirms their opinions. That hi&s;tory is probably defective in accounts of comets; but imperfect as it is, it affords proof that mo&s;t of the plagues which have been exten|&s;ive and &s;evere, have been preceded or attended with the ap|proach of comets.</P>
<P>From numerous facts in the hi&s;tory of pe&s;tilence, I am led to &s;u&s;pect that comets have &s;ome effect on the fire or electricity which &s;urrounds and penetrates this globe. One of the mo&s;t certain, as well as mo&s;t remarkable phenomena, which attend plagues, is, earthquakes; and in general, the more &s;evere or numerous have been the earthquakes, the more violent and de&s;tructive the plagues. This remark applies to mo&s;t of the countries in Europe, where the plague has been epidemic; but is more e&s;pecially true of Ita|ly and the Syrian coa&s;t, with the whole of A&s;ia Minor.</P>
<P>In confirmation of this remark, we need not re&s;ort to facts in ancient times, when earthquakes &s;eem to have been more fre|quent and violent, than in modern times. Within the pre&s;ent century, the &s;hocks which have uniformly attended pe&s;tilence, leave no room to que&s;tion that &s;ome connection exi&s;ts between the two phenomena.</P>
<P>Now it is a fact that will appear from an in&s;pection of the pre|ceding hi&s;tory, that, during the approximation of comets to our &s;y&s;tem, earthquakes have been mo&s;t numerous, general and vio|lent. A great proportion of the tremendous eruptions of volca|noes have happened during the &s;ame periods. To prove this, we need not go back to the terrible concu&s;&s;ions and violent di&s;charge of Etna, which clo&s;ed the long pe&s;tilence in Athens, in the fifth
<PB N="82" REF="036687_0437_100AA43729D4C550">
and &s;ixth year of the Peloppone&s;ian war&mdash;nor to the dreadful earthquakes and eruption, which preceded the de&s;tructive plague in the reign of Titus. We have &s;imilar facts in modern times. The plagues in the Levant in 1743, and e&s;pecially in Me&s;&s;ina, were accompanied or preceded by violent earthquakes and a comet. The exten&s;ive plague of 1760, was attended with all the great phenomena&mdash;comets, eruption of Ve&s;uvius and tremendous earth|quakes. The pe&s;tilential periods of 1770 and 1783, were in|troduced by the &s;ame phenomena.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts afford &s;trong evidence that the approach of com|ets, not only influences the weather, but al&s;o calls into action the &s;ubterranean fires. By what means tho&s;e erratic bodies pro|duce this effect, may be a curious que&s;tion. That the internal fires explode at times, without the attractive powers of comets, is undoubted; but the concurrence of earthquakes and violent di&s;charges from volcanoes, during the appearance of comets, or near the time, &s;eems to render it certain that tho&s;e bodies have a mo&s;t powerful effect on the element of fire which is diffu&s;ed through the globe and the &s;urrounding atmo&s;phere.</P>

<P>This ob&s;ervation of the writer is well founded&mdash;comets &s;el|dom fail to occa&s;ion a univer&s;al defect of rain and &s;prings in &s;ome countries, and pe&s;tilence marches in the train with its other effects.</P>

<P>The&s;e remarks al&s;o are ju&s;tified by our own ob&s;ervations. They were remarkably verified in the comet, the meteor and the brilliant halo which marked the commencement of the la&s;t &s;eries of epidemics in 1788 and 1789.</P>
<P>Riverius is expre&s;s to the &s;ame point. He a&s;&s;erts that comets

never appear without being followed by epidemic and pe&s;tilent di&s;ea&s;es, and various changes in the phy&s;ical world. He in&s;tan|ces that of 1618, in his own days. The ob&s;ervation is verified by the te&s;timony of all ancient writers and by a uniform &s;eries of modern facts.</P>
<P>The order of events is exemplified in the epidemic periods of 1769&mdash;and of 1782.

<P>Earthquakes con&s;titute a part of the vi&s;ible effects of the gen|eral cau&s;e which produces pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>It has &s;ometimes happened that in the&s;e convul&s;ions of the earth, a vapor has been extricated which has produced immedi|ate di&s;ea&s;e. The great earthquake in South-America in 1730 was &s;peedily followed by a pe&s;tilential fever. The de&s;truction of Port-Royal in Jamaica in 1692 was &s;oon &s;ucceeded by a mortal fever in all parts of the i&s;land; and the univer&s;ality of the fever would lead us to &s;u&s;pect that vapor, in this in&s;tance, could not have been the cau&s;e. At Venice in 1343, the plague &s;oon fol|lowed an earthquake.</P>
<P>In the year 615, violent earthquakes in Italy were followed by "lues elephantiae." Baronius, vol. 8. 243. Baglivus re|lates that the great earthquakes in Italy in 1703, were &s;ucceed|ed by numerous di&s;ea&s;es, e&s;pecially opthalmia, ery&s;ipelas, me&s;en|teric fevers and double tertians. In autumn, the &s;mall-pox be|came epidemic, apoplexies were frequent and &s;udden deaths al|mo&s;t daily. With re&s;pect to apoplexies and &s;udden deaths after earthquakes, we have al&s;o the authority of Seneca.</P>
<P>Baglivus further remarks "po&s;t terraemotus frequenter &s;uc|cedunt pe&s;tilentia, vel morbi graves et epidemici, imo nova et inaudita morborum genera." p. 530. The idea that new and
<PB N="84" REF="036687_0439_100AA439CDD44880">
unknown &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;es follow earthquakes, if well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ounded, leads us to &s;u&s;pect that the changes in the characters of di&s;ea&s;es are attributable to the various action of the electrical fluid.</P>
<P>The terribly de&s;tructive earthquakes in Naples and Sicily in 1693, were &s;peedily followed by malignant fevers, tertians ac|companied with delirium and lethargy, and the &s;mall-pox which was very fatal to children.</P>
<BIBL>Baddam's Mem. vol. 3. 91.</BIBL>
<P>"Frequent earthquakes, &s;ays Fraca&s;torius de contagione, p. 136, announce future pe&s;tilence, and by means of exhalations, tend to produce it." Van Swieten agrees in this opinion.</P>
<P>Seneca a&s;&s;erts, Nat. Que&s;t. art. 27, that pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es u&s;ually follow great earthquakes. He &s;uppo&s;es the air, enclo&s;ed in the earth, to become vitiated, either by &s;tagnation or through the defect of the internal fires "internorum ignium vitio." He thinks this air when forced into the atmo&s;phere, renders it impure and unwhole&s;ome, generating new kinds of di&s;ea&s;es. He rea&s;ons by analogy that as water corrupts by &s;tagnation, &s;o will air. Hence after earthquakes, "&s;ubitae continuaeque mortes et mon&s;tro&s;a genera morborum, ut ex novis orta cau&s;is&mdash;nec prius pe&s;tilentia definit, quam &s;piritum illum gravem exercuit laxitas coeli, ventorum jactatio."</P>
<P>This opinion of Seneca is certainly entitled to re&s;pect, and has been followed by many di&s;tingui&s;hed authors, Van Helmont, Van Swieten, Sydenham, Hodges, Baglivus and others.</P>
<P>But I &s;u&s;pect the modern di&s;coveries will enable us to furni&s;h a more rational &s;olution of the phenomenon. I am inclined to believe that a &s;uperabundant &s;timulus, occa&s;ioned by the &s;hock of an earthquake, and an atmo&s;phere &s;urcharged with electricity, will more rationally account for the apoplexies, &s;udden deaths, &s;mall-pox and malignant fevers. If a deleterious vapor were the cau&s;e, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e its effects would be &s;peedy, and its force &s;oon expended, the atmo&s;phere being &s;peedily purified by winds. But, if &s;timulus is the cau&s;e, it may exi&s;t for a long time in the atmo&s;phere, and the human body not yield to its force in many weeks or months. This would better accord with facts, for al|tho di&s;ea&s;es appear &s;oon after an earthquake, yet the wor&s;t effects are often many months or a year after, as was the ca&s;e in the
<PB N="85" REF="036687_0440_100AA3FE692562E0">
reign of Titus, when the pe&s;tilence was the year after the earth|quake and eruption of Ve&s;uvius.</P>
<P>There are however many authorities in favor of the vapor. Seneca relates that a vapor cau&s;ed by an earthquake in Campania, de&s;troyed &s;ix hundred &s;heep. Van Helmont &s;ays that "popular plagues do draw their fir&s;t occa&s;ional matter from an earthquake." Page 1125.</P>
<P>The fact that a vi&s;ible vapor, without an earthquake, &s;ometimes appears &s;uddenly in a place and evidently produces di&s;ea&s;e, is a &s;trong confirmation of Seneca's opinion. A memorable example happened at Rouen, in 1753, as related under that year. Fore&s;|tus relates that an epidemic catarrh or &s;ore throat, in Alemar, A. D. 1557, &s;uddenly invaded 2000 per&s;ons, of whom 200 died. He a&s;cribes it to a vapor, for the di&s;ea&s;e was preceded by thick clouds of an ill &s;mell.</P>
<BIBL>See Van Swieten, vol. 16. p. 31.</BIBL>
<P>Mazeray relates that the black pe&s;tilence of 1347 aro&s;e in Chi|na from a vapor, which bur&s;t from the earth with a &s;mell mo&s;t hor|ribly offen&s;ive. This fact is cited by Boyle vol. 5. 60. in proof that pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es &s;pring from vapors evolved from the earth. This author &s;uppo&s;es new di&s;ea&s;es may be generated by vapors, and remarks further that countries abounding with cinnabar e&s;cape the plague.</P>
<P>But it &s;eldom happens that pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es can be traced directly to earthquakes. On the other hand, altho great plagues are almo&s;t invariably accompanied with &s;hocks of the earth, yet it more u&s;ually happens that the pe&s;tilence appears before the concu&s;&s;ion. Thus the &s;hocks which alarmed and laid wa&s;te Ita|ly in 1348, 1349 and 1350, were preceded by the dreadful plague of 1347.</P>
<P>Sometimes the earthquakes precede the plague, but more gen|erally the pe&s;tilence appears fir&s;t, or at lea&s;t the petechial or oth|er malignant fever, which marks the commencement of the pe&s;|tilence. Thus the plague of 1760 was preceded by a &s;potted fe|ver in 1759, which marked the approach of the calamity; which &s;potted fever appeared in Syria, <HI>before</HI> the terrible earthquakes of that period.</P>
<P>In the well known plague at Oczakow in 1738 and 39, an
<PB N="86" REF="036687_0441_100AA43C78A7FB88">
earthquake happened about the time the di&s;ea&s;e began to abate. Van Swieten, vol. 16. 47. Such was the fact in the days of Thucydides. Numerous ob&s;ervations on the&s;e phenomena lead me to &s;u&s;pect, that the electricity which is to produce the explo|&s;ion, is in action for a con&s;iderable time <HI>before</HI> the &s;hock, and that it is this <HI>previous action</HI> which occa&s;ions epidemic di&s;ea&s;es. That is, the &s;timulus of fire or electricity produces &s;en&s;ible effects on the bodies of animals the more &s;u&s;ceptible objects, before it does on the le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible &s;ub&s;tances in the bowels of the earth.</P>
<P>The earthquakes do not always occur in the &s;eat of the pe&s;ti|lence. I find no concu&s;&s;ion mentioned to have happened at Lon|don in 1665, or in the years next preceding or following; but &s;hocks were experienced in the neighboring counties in 1665, and 1666.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to have mi&s;led the able Diemerbroeck, who, in rea|&s;oning on the cau&s;es of the plague, objects to the influence of earthquakes, becau&s;e no &s;hocks occurred at Nimeguen, before the pe&s;tilence of 1636. It is probably true that earthquakes are not u&s;ually the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of the plague; but that they have &s;ome con|nection with the cau&s;e, I can hardly doubt. The mi&s;takes of Diemerbroeck and others on this point &s;eem to have ari&s;en from con&s;idering the plague as an i&s;olated di&s;ea&s;e, and as depending on a cau&s;e local and temporary; whereas a ju&s;t view of the &s;ubject mu&s;t comprehend all the di&s;ea&s;es of increa&s;ed malignity which precede the plague, very often for two or three years. Such a view al&s;o mu&s;t include, among the cau&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e, the agitations or derangement of the elements in remote parts of the country. Thus, altho no earthquake was experienced at Nime|guen, about the time of the plague, yet a &s;evere &s;hock was felt at Lau&s;anne in 1634.&mdash;Key&s;ler's travels 190. This marked &s;ome general action of internal fire, which, tho it might not explode &s;o as to &s;hake all Germany, might have produced effects, by means of an in&s;en&s;ible vapor or &s;timulus, in all parts of Europe. Certain it is, that for the period between 1631, the year of the tremendous eruption of Ve&s;uvius, and the year 1637, all Eu|rope was afflicted with mortal epidemics. The philo&s;opher who would obtain ju&s;t views of the cau&s;es, mu&s;t extend his inquiries to
<PB N="87" REF="036687_0442_100AA4002F4499E8">
all the great phenomena, which occurred during this whole peri|od, in all Europe at lea&s;t, if not in the American hemi&s;phere; for &s;uch a view only will comprehend the whole extent of the pe&s;tilential &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be forgotten, that during this period from 1633 to 1637, when the plague or other de&s;olating di&s;ea&s;es, &s;pread over both hemi&s;pheres, Etna was in a continual &s;tate of eruption; as it was for fifteen years, during the pe&s;tilential con&s;titutions de&s;|cribed by Sydenham in his days.</P>
<P>In looking over the li&s;t of comets, and the hi&s;tory of earth|quakes, I am compelled to believe the approach of comets to have no &s;mall influence on the electricity and &s;ubterranean fires of the globe. Such a va&s;tly great proportion of the violent concu&s;&s;ions of the earth have happened, within a few months of the appearance of comets, that no rea&s;onable man can &s;uppo&s;e the coincidences to be the re&s;ult of accident.</P>
<P>Equally remarkable have been the coincidences in time be|tween the appearance of comets and the explo&s;ions of volcanoes. And this fact is no trifling confirmation of my opinion, re&s;pect|ing the influence of comets in producing earthquakes; for earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes are often cotemporane|ous.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is not only during the <HI>appearance</HI> of comets, that their effects are perceived in the elements, but for many months <HI>before</HI> and <HI>after.</HI> I can te&s;tify from careful ob&s;ervations that the effects of that in Augu&s;t 1797, were very obvious, in anomalous tides, as early as the la&s;t week in May; and the inundations in England during the autumn and win|ter following, &s;how its effects &s;everal months after its departure. The whole hi&s;tory of comets and their effects warrants this conclu&s;ion. Seneca made this remark &s;eventeen centuries ago. The&s;e are his words.</P>
<P>"Ari&s;toteles ait, cometas &s;ignificare tempe&s;tatem et ventorum intem|perantiam atque imbrium.&mdash;Non &s;tatim cometes ortus ventos et pluvias minat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, &s;ed <HI>totum annum &s;u&s;pectum facit.</HI>&mdash;"Ari&s;totle ob&s;erves that comets indicate &s;torms and violent winds and rain.&mdash;The&s;e effects how|ever do not immediately follow their appearance, but are to be expect|ed, during the whole year." He then mentions that &s;uch was the fact, with the comet predicted by Ari&s;totle and Theophra&s;ius, and which appeared in the con&s;ul&s;hip of Paterculus and Vapi&s;cus. Nat. Que&s;t. lib. 7.</P>
<P>I would further ob&s;erve that comets move in trajectories of an elip|tical or parabolic form, the &s;un being &s;ituated in one of the foci. The time when we ob&s;erve them is when they pa&s;s this part of the ellip&s;is. Now according to the univer&s;al law of planets, by which they de&s;cribe equal area<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in equal times, their motion mu&s;t be mo&s;t rapid when near|e&s;t the &s;un, and within our &s;ight. Before their appearance, and after their departure, their movement is &s;lower, than when within the &s;o|lar &s;y&s;tem, and they may be near the earth, many months before they enter the &s;y&s;tem or become vi&s;ible. Hence their influence on the earth &s;o long before and after their appearance.</P>
<P>It is further to be ob&s;erved that many comets doubtle&s;s enter the &s;y&s;|tem and pa&s;s round the &s;un without ever being &s;een, and &s;uch as come from regions of &s;pace directly oppo&s;ite to the earth, mu&s;t be <HI>invi&s;ible,</HI> unle&s;s we can &s;ee them in the &s;plendor of the &s;un's rays. This re|mark is as old as Seneca and older. He relates an in&s;tance, in which Po&s;idonious di&s;covered a comet, in the darkne&s;s of a &s;olar eclip&s;e, which would not have been &s;een, had not the eclip&s;e happened. Lib. 7. &s;ect. 20.</P>
<P>Newton and Halley have made the &s;ame remark. Hence perhaps we may account for violent &s;ea&s;ons, like the &s;evere winter of 1780, which happened without the appearance of any comet. This is mere con|jecture.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="036687_0443_100A89C4E09A2D18">I cannot however admit, that the explo&s;ions of &s;ubterranean fires, are the direct exciting cau&s;e of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es. It is indeed a&s;certained, beyond all que&s;tion, that periods of exten|&s;ive pe&s;tilence and mortality are remarkable for earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes. But the explo&s;ions of fire do not &s;o generally <HI>precede</HI> epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, as to authorize the &s;uppo&s;i|tion that they <HI>produce</HI> tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. Earthquakes occur, dur|ing the prevalence of pe&s;tilential or other mortal epidemics, but in the mid&s;t of the period, or &s;ometimes at the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Hence I deduce an opinion, that pe&s;tilence and earthquakes depend on one common cau&s;e; which excites into action the in|ternal fires. But I &s;uppo&s;e the action or fermentation may pre|cede, for months and even years, the explo&s;ion in earthquakes and volcanoes and by means of an in&s;en&s;ible vapor, or heat or electrical di&s;charges, the elements of water and air may be e&s;&s;en|tially affected, in &s;uch a manner as to impair the principles of animal and vegetable life. Whether this is a ju&s;t explication of the cau&s;e, may be a que&s;tion; but &s;o many phenomena concur to authorize it, that I cannot withhold my a&s;&s;ent to the general principle.</P>
<P>The &s;ame effect perhaps may be produced by the exce&s;&s;ive ac|tion of mere &s;timulus upon the animal &s;y&s;tem, without the infu|&s;ion of a deleterious vapor into the air.</P>
<P>A remarkable evidence of the effects of fire or electricity on the earth and air, before its explo&s;ion, is the extreme drouth which is often experienced over whole continents or the
<PB N="89" REF="036687_0444_100AA404C9B56D88">
whole world, for &s;ix and even twelve months antecedent to a great eruption of volcanoes.</P>
<P>In confirmation of my principle, that the changes in the ele|ments producing epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, are effected by the all-perva|ding action of electricity, the u&s;ual appearance of meteors or cele&s;|tial lights, in pe&s;tilential periods, mu&s;t be mentioned. For the truth of the fact, we have ample proofs in every age. The in|&s;tances of meteors or other cele&s;tial appearances of fire, which are recorded of pe&s;tilential periods, are &s;o numerous, as to leave no room to que&s;tion the connection between the cau&s;e of pe&s;tilence, and the fire that belongs to the &s;y&s;tem. Sometimes the&s;e fiery ap|pearances are &s;tationary lights in the &s;ky, which the frightened im|aginations of men have formed into armies ready for combat, and con&s;idered as the preludes of bloody battles. Sometimes the heavens have been filled with tho&s;e &s;mall meteors, called falling or &s;hooting &s;tars. At other times immen&s;e globes of fire have traver&s;ed the cele&s;tial regions, and bur&s;t with a tremendous report.</P>

<P>During the extreme heat which introduced the pe&s;tilence of the la&s;t &s;ummer, 1798, about the 9th of Augu&s;t, the &s;mall me|teors or falling &s;tars were incredibly numerous, for &s;everal nights.

<P>Diemerbroeck remarks that during the &s;ummers of 1635 and 6, at the time of the &s;evere plague in Holland, there was a va&s;t number of ardent &s;tars, gliding through the cele&s;tial regions and

falling to the earth. "Stellarum ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lentium in Coelo oberranti|um magnus concur&s;us, et in terram prolap&s;io." He mentions likewi&s;e almo&s;t continual fla&s;hes of light, in a &s;erene &s;ky, or &s;i|lent lightning.</P>
<P>Livy mentions that the heavens appeared to be in a flame, pre|vious to the &s;evere pe&s;tilence of the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">90 from the building of Rome.</P>
<P>A flame in the heavens is noted under the years, 733, 742 and 788, all which were pe&s;tilential. This flame is not de&s;cri|bed, and whether it was of the &s;pecies of Aurora Borealis, which extended over the cele&s;tial region, or of that &s;pecies of light, or yellowi&s;h red colour, which di&s;tingui&s;hes our modern <HI>dark days,</HI> cannot perhaps be determined. But a curious phenomenon of this kind happened in the &s;evere winter of 1741, which was too remarkable to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence; e&s;pecially as it may po&s;|&s;ibly explain what Livy and many other hi&s;torians have recorded, that at certain times, "it rained blood." The a&s;&s;ertion is often found in hi&s;torians of credit, and has by the moderns, been num|bered among the extravagancies of popular credulity. But an appearance which would warrant &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion occurred in this country, and is &s;till recollected by old people.</P>
<P>In the month of January 1741, in the mid&s;t of one of the colde&s;t winters of this century, there was a little relaxation of the rigorous cold, during which the heavens were overca&s;t with clouds and a little rain fell. Late at night, during this falling weather, the heavens appeared all in a flame, &s;o bright as to illu|minate the earth and render objects every where di&s;tinctly vi&s;i|ble. Many people &s;aw it and were alarmed, &s;uppo&s;ing the great day was at hand. The rain which fell during this light, had preci&s;ely the appearance of drops of blood di&s;tilling from the clouds.</P>
<P>This relation is taken from my father, who was then nineteen years old, and recollects all the circum&s;tances more minutely than the events of the la&s;t year.</P>
<P>The well known dark day in May 1780, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;imilar light in the heavens; but not occurring in the night, it was le&s;s an object of wonder.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="036687_0446_100AA406503DFD50">I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect a &s;imilar phenomenon will account for tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in many hi&s;tories, which &s;peak of raining blood, and ena|ble us to do ju&s;tice to the veracity of the writers.</P>
<P>Appearances of this kind have u&s;ually occurred in periods of pe&s;tilence, when the imaginations of men have been &s;ubject to alarm; and they have often happened during extraordinary &s;ea|&s;ons. The light of 1741, was during a mo&s;t &s;evere winter, and in the mo&s;t &s;ickly period, that has occurred this century. See the London bills of mortality. In America, that winter was followed by pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The dark day of 1780, was on the opening of &s;pring, after a mo&s;t &s;evere winter, and altho that year was not &s;ickly in general, yet in the year following, we had an epidemic catarrh, &s;ucceed|ed by a &s;eries of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es of other kinds. It is remark|able too that on that very day began a violent eruption of mount Etna.</P>
<P>In 1716, in the month of October, happened a dark day; this was after a mo&s;t &s;evere winter in Europe. I have no ac|count of the &s;ea&s;ons in America, but the next winter was unu&s;u|ally &s;evere, and &s;now fell in extraordinary quantities.</P>
<P>On the 9th of Augu&s;t 1732 happened another dark day. This was followed by earthquakes, a &s;evere winter and univer&s;al catarrh.</P>
<P>The 19th of October 1762 was equally remarkable for dark|ne&s;s, with the phenomenon of a red, or yellowi&s;h tinge in the heavens, which gave to the &s;un, when it appeared, the color of blood. Some rain fell during the day, and the water was of a dirty &s;ulphurous &s;mell. There had been two earthquakes, with epidemic catarrh, in America in 1761. In the &s;ame year with the darkne&s;s, 1762, the catarrh was epidemic in Europe; and the winter of that year was exce&s;&s;ively &s;evere in both hemi&s;|pheres. A comet appeared in 1762 and an eruption of Etna followed the &s;evere winter, in 1763. There were earthquakes al&s;o in A&s;ia in 1762. Who can doubt that the vapor, occa|&s;ioning &s;uch darkne&s;s, is the effect of the agitation of the fire of the globe?</P>
<P>Similar in&s;tances of extraordinary darkne&s;s have occurred in
<PB N="92" REF="036687_0447_100A89C86F0D93F8">
every age. They are mentioned in the years before Chri&s;t 366 and 295&mdash;and of the Chri&s;tian era 252, 746, 775, and in ma|ny other periods. And the reader will ob&s;erve, this darkne&s;s is cotemporary with pe&s;tilence, in almo&s;t every in&s;tance. Du|ring the plague of 746, the darkne&s;s was of &s;everal days dura|tion &mdash;in 252 it was of three days, and in 775 of &s;ix days con|tinuance. A &s;imilar darkne&s;s accompanied the pe&s;tilence in E|gypt, in the days of Pharaoh. Many other in&s;tances have been mentioned in the preceding hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>In America, it has been cu&s;tomary to a&s;cribe this unu&s;ual ap|pearance to conden&s;ed volumes of &s;moke, after the burning of immen&s;e tracts of woods in the we&s;tern parts of the country. But I cannot learn that any great fires have u&s;ually preceded the&s;e dark days; and negative evidence, in &s;o many in&s;tances, amounts to proof that no great fore&s;ts have been burnt. Be&s;ides, the &s;ame phenomenon has been often ob&s;erved, in countries where there were no fore&s;ts, as in Italy, Syria, A&s;ia Minor and Egypt, and e&s;pecially in England.</P>
<P>That the &s;moke of burning fore&s;ts cannot be the cau&s;e may be rendered very certain by the&s;e con&s;iderations. Fir&s;t, the cau&s;e is not equal to the effect. Had the woods from the 40th de|gree of latitude in America to the 50th been all con&s;umed in a day, the &s;moke would not have been &s;ufficient to cloud the &s;un over the territory covered by darkne&s;s on the 19th of May. Any per&s;on may judge of this who has &s;een large tracts of fore&s;t on fire. That thirty or forty miles of burning fore&s;t, &s;hould cover five hundred miles with impenetrable darkne&s;s, is too ab|&s;urd to de&s;erve a &s;erious refutation.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, the color of &s;moke, when elevated into high regions of the atmo&s;phere, is very different from that of the vapor which cau&s;es the darkne&s;s on all &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>But what decides this que&s;tion is the lightning, thunder and rain, and e&s;pecially the meteors that accompany the&s;e clouds of vapor. As far as I can learn, &s;ome or all of the&s;e phenomena attend dark days. Thunder was heard on the morning of the 19th of May, in mo&s;t places. Mem. Am. Acad. vol. 1. 238. Violent thunder &s;qualls and a meteor followed the great darkne&s;s

in Canada in 1785. The&s;e phenomena demon&s;trate that the clouds, on &s;uch occa&s;ion, have a connection with electricity. This is further evidenced by the &s;mell of &s;ulphur, in the water that falls, and the &s;cum that is left on objects&mdash;&s;moke would not produce either; nor would the large&s;t volume of &s;moke ever rai&s;ed into the air, &s;pread over an exten&s;ive region, a den&s;e &s;ub|&s;tance that &s;hould become vi&s;ible and tangible on the earth. Be|&s;ides this darkne&s;s or vapor &s;ometimes occurs in winter, when the earth is covered with &s;now.</P>
<P>When we connect with the&s;e facts, the circum&s;tance that the&s;e dark days always occur, during or near the time of volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or the unu&s;ual &s;ea&s;ons which accompany pe&s;tilence and epidemic diea&s;es of other kinds, we &s;hall be at no lo&s;s to charge them to the account of the central fires, or the di&s;charges of electricity. This accumulation of vapor is not a more &s;urpri&s;ing phenomenon, than the &s;udden change in the properties of the atmo&s;phere which produces univer&s;al catarrh.</P>
<P>Hodge, who wrote on the plague of London, and who ap|pears not to have been rewarded with celebrity equal to his mer|its, &s;uppo&s;es the cau&s;e of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es to be a &s;ubtle aura, or vapor exhaled from the bowels of the earth, which has, by too much heat and humidity, lo&s;t its whole&s;ome qualities. He &s;ays, in proof of his opinion, that a given quantity of earth, infu&s;ed into water in &s;pring, depo&s;its more &s;alt than at another time of the year.</P>
<P>His idea &s;eems to be not very different from that of Van Hel|mont, who &s;uppo&s;es the cau&s;e of pe&s;tilence to be a gas or air, which has <HI>putrified by continuance,</HI> as the tran&s;lation is; by which is meant, probably, a &s;tagnation in the earth.</P>
<P>The doctrin of an in&s;en&s;ible vapor, infu&s;ed into the atmo&s;|phere from the bowels of the earth, may perhaps be thought wholly conjectural. But there are &s;ome phenomena which can hardly be re&s;olved without re&s;orting to the action of the electrical fluid. The &s;udden changes of weather cannot be accounted for, in all ca&s;es, by changes in the winds. Indeed the mo&s;t reflect|ing philo&s;ophical men acknowledge them&s;elves puzzled to a&s;&s;ign rea&s;ons, for many of the rapid tran&s;itions from heat to cold and
<PB N="94" REF="036687_0449_100AA443728CFE88">
from cold to heat. It has been &s;ugge&s;ted, that the heat may a&s;cend and de&s;cend in the atmo&s;phere, by means of phy&s;ical laws, to us unknown; but this &s;uppo&s;ition is not &s;upported by any clear proofs, perhaps not by rational probabilities.</P>
<P>There are many rea&s;ons which incline me to believe that the principle of fire, the mo&s;t &s;ubtle, penetrating, active fluid in creation, and unque&s;tionably the mo&s;t powerful agent in all the movements of matter, pa&s;&s;es more frequently and rapidly from the earth into the atmo&s;phere and vice ver&s;a, than is commonly imagined. I &s;u&s;pect that an intimate connection &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in this re&s;pect, between the interior of the globe, and the atmo&s;phere which &s;urrounds it.</P>
<P>To the rapid pa&s;&s;ing of heat from the earth to the air, and from the air to the earth, we may perhaps a&s;cribe many of the amazing changes which take place in the temperature of the air, in a few hours, and often without a change of wind. The increa&s;e and the moderation of cold are &s;ometimes very obvious, long before the change of winds to which we u&s;ually a&s;cribe &s;uch changes; and I &s;u&s;pect that the changes of winds are more fre|quently the <HI>effect,</HI> than the cau&s;e, of a change in the temperature.</P>
<P>But there are &s;ome appearances, in the atmo&s;phere, previous to &s;hocks of earthquake, which demon&s;trate a clo&s;e connection between the atmo&s;phere and &s;ubterranean fire. A remarkable one in this country, and generally in others, is a univer&s;al &s;eren|ity and tranquillity in the atmo&s;phere. The &s;ky is cloudle&s;s, and all nature, if at night, is wrapped in profound &s;ilence. This phenomenon is too uniform a precur&s;or of earthquakes, to be deemed an accidental circum&s;tance. It mu&s;t be an effect of &s;ome connection between the air above, and the cau&s;e of earthquakes.</P>
<P>It is remarkable al&s;o that &s;eamen &s;ometimes ob&s;erve a &s;welling of the ocean, without wind, and before any &s;hock of the earth; and this fact, Pliny mentions among the &s;igns of an approaching earthquake.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Is not this &s;welling of the ocean, previous to an earthquake, anal|agous to the tides? May not both be a&s;cribed to the force of electricity; the &s;well of the water preceding earthquakes being irregular, as depend|ing on no regular vi&s;ible cau&s;e; and the tides being more regular, as be|ing the effect of the moon's influence on the electrical principle. This idea &s;eems to derive &s;ome &s;trength from the known fact that earthquakes u&s;ually happen in periods of the moon's revolution, when that orb ex|erts its greate&s;t influence on the earth. From numerous calculations, it appears that earthquakes u&s;ually occur near the moon's perigee or apogee or the change or conjunction of &s;un and moon; generally about three days before or after the conjunction&mdash;this, by the way, is the very time when epidemic di&s;ea&s;es u&s;ually invade the patient, or come to fatal termination, according to the remarks of all modern phy&s;icians &mdash;a &s;ingular fact that may lead to important conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>In a few in&s;tances, earthquakes happen near the full moon&mdash;the oth|er po&s;ition in which that &s;atellite exerts more than her ordinary influ|ence on the earth.</P>
<P>Let the&s;e facts be compared with the occurrence of violent tempe&s;ts about the &s;ame time of the moon's revolution, the inva&s;ion of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es and the full tides.</P>

<P>The&s;e phenomena indicate a connection between the atmo&s;|phere and the &s;ubterranean fire, which is altogether invi&s;ible, and to men, imperceptible.

Or what defect is there in the ma&s;s of air &s;urrounding the earth, which is to be &s;upplied by an explo&s;ion of &s;ubterranean fire? That there is a connection or dependence of the fire above on that beneath the earth, and that this &s;ubtle fluid acts and reacts between the earth and the air, with a rapidity and a force beyond all calculation, is to me extremely probable. The appearances that precede earthquakes indicate, that the fire which is to produce the &s;hock, is in vio|lent action, for a con&s;iderable time, before the &s;hock.

<P>The various &s;ounds or noi&s;es which precede and attend earth|quakes, are a &s;trong confirmation of the&s;e ideas. The u&s;ual premonitory &s;ound is compared to the rattling of carriages on a pavement. Sometimes it is de&s;cribed, as the rumbling of di&s;tant thunder. But in truth the &s;ound is different at different di&s;tances, and re&s;embles no other &s;ound in nature. It is alto|gether &s;ui generis. It is mo&s;t analogous, when near, to the rat|tling &s;ound from a near explo&s;ion of the electrical fluid; as tho&s;e can te&s;tify who have been near the place where lightning has fal|len upon objects. It bears no re&s;emblance at all to any artificial &s;ounds, made by the explo&s;ions of gun-powder, or other human contrivances. It is mo&s;t unque&s;tionably the effect of the elec|trical fluid, ru&s;hing from one part of our &s;y&s;tem to another&mdash; probably from the earth to the atmo&s;phere, to re&s;tore the equili|brium, which has been, by &s;ome means, de&s;troyed, or to an&s;wer other unknown purpo&s;es. This idea corre&s;ponds with the mod|ern theory of earthquakes, which a&s;cribes them to the electrical fluid. See the Encyclopedia, art. earthquake. Let it be ob|&s;erved that at &s;ea, no &s;ound precedes an earthquake; water be|ing a good conductor of electricity.</P>
<P>Eruptions of volcanoes have al&s;o been preceded many weeks by a vi&s;ible fog or vapor, &s;u&s;pended over the mountain, as hap|pened before the great di&s;charges of Heckla in 1783. To what cau&s;e &s;hall we a&s;cribe this, but to the action of fire which pre|cedes the explo&s;ion? And if a vi&s;ible vapor may be extricated by this action, for <HI>months</HI> before the explo&s;ion, of which we have <HI>certain</HI> evidence, why may we not &s;uppo&s;e, a &s;maller action or force to expel an invi&s;ible vapor, in any place and at any time?</P>
<P>Other facts authorize this conjecture. On the 12th of Sep|tember 1784, the water of the Loch Tay in Scotland, &s;uddenly receded 300 feet and left the channel dry; then returned; con|tinuing this vibration for every &s;even minutes for two hours, and at the &s;ame hour in the day, for a week, with le&s;s violence.

<P>If we admit then the action of electricity to be the cau&s;e of earthquakes, we &s;hall have reached the general proximate cau&s;e of tho&s;e epidemic di&s;ea&s;es which &s;peedily &s;ucceed concu&s;&s;ions of the earth. The cau&s;e mu&s;t be the action of fire, the mo&s;t ener|getic principle in nature. The manner in which this effect is produced, whether by forcing an unwhole&s;ome vapor from the interior of the earth, and vitiating the atmo&s;phere; or whether by &s;imply changing, on mechanical principles, the proportion of oxygen contained in atmo&s;pheric air, or by mere &s;timulus or other unknown means, is a que&s;tion of a curious nature, and worthy of philo&s;ophic inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>One thing is very evident, that what I denominate a <HI>pe&s;tilen|tial principle,</HI> does, at certain times, pervade not only the ele|ment of air, but the water al&s;o. The proofs of this are abun|dantly numerous and convincing. In all the great plagues which have afflicted the human race, other animals, as hor&s;es, cattle, &s;heep, &s;ometimes cats, dogs and fowls, together with the fi&s;h in rivers and the ocean, and even vegetables, have borne their &s;hare in the calamity. The pe&s;tilential principle has extended to every &s;pecies of life. The bea&s;ts of the field peri&s;h with deadly epi|demics; the fi&s;h die on the bottom of rivers and the &s;ea, or be|come lean and &s;ickly; while corn is bla&s;ted on the mo&s;t fertile plains, and the fruits in gardens and orchards, wither or fail to arrive at their u&s;ual &s;tate of perfection.</P>
<P>In the de&s;tructive plague which de&s;olated Italy in the time of Romulus, Plutarch and Zonaras mention a general &s;terility of the earth; the very trees were affected, and all nature appeared to be defective in its powers of production.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the pe&s;tilential period, in the reign of Ju&s;tinian, Baronius &s;tates that corn was deficient in quantity, and defective in its nouri&s;hing qualities.</P>
<P>About the year 1600, crops failed in all parts of Europe; as they did in both hemi&s;pheres, about the clo&s;e of the la&s;t centu|ry.

Such was the ca&s;e in 1740, in &s;ome parts of Europe; and in 1766. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of grain in India in 1770, and in 1783 and 1789, are &s;till remembered; and in &s;ome of the&s;e in&s;tances, the crops failed, at the &s;ame time, in China, India, Europe and America.</P>
<P>When exce&s;&s;ive rains or dry &s;ea&s;ons precede this failure of crops, men are at no lo&s;s to a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;e; altho, in the&s;e ca|&s;es, they may &s;ometimes mi&s;take the true cau&s;e. But it often happens that grain fails of its u&s;ual perfection, in &s;ea&s;ons appa|rently the mo&s;t temperate and favorable. Ob&s;erving farmers re|mark that, in certain years, when bla&s;t or mildew is expected from intemperate weather, grain proves to be good; at other times, the grain will &s;hrink very much, under a &s;eries of weather apparently the mo&s;t propitious. This has been ob&s;erved in Fair|field county, in Connecticut, where the excellent lands formerly produced great crops of wheat, with as much certainty as any other grain; but within a few years pa&s;t, wheat has failed, with|out any apparent cau&s;e.

<P>The failure of certain &s;pecies of fruit-trees and &s;hrubs is a fact equally remarkable.</P>

Some of the ex|cre&s;cences contain a &s;mall white worm, about a line in length; but they perforate the wood after the excre&s;cence is formed, as appears by their path; and &s;ome of the&s;e warts contain no in&s;ect whatever. The in&s;ect therefore finds a nidus in the excre&s;cence, but is rather an effect, than a cau&s;e.

<P>It is remarkable that the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es among corn, fruit-trees and &s;hrubs have generally, if not always, appeared fir&s;t on the At|lantic &s;hore, and gradually extended them&s;elves into the interior country.

This putrefaction, is, by the moderns, con&s;id|ered as a fruitful &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;es. In &s;ome ca&s;es it may be &s;o; but it is always an <HI>effect</HI> of the &s;ame cau&s;e which produces epidemics.</P>
<P>Another remarkable fact to prove the univer&s;ality of the pe&s;ti|lential principle, is the &s;ickne&s;s and death of fi&s;h in rivers and the &s;ea. Several examples are recorded in ancient hi&s;tory. See the years 590, 994, 1240 and others. The number however of &s;uch facts is not great, in the old books; and whenever this phenomenon occurred, it was a&s;cribed to fro&s;t, to a battle among the fi&s;h, or other improbable cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In modern times we have many examples recorded, but prob|ably many others have e&s;caped ob&s;ervation; or been con&s;idered as things of no moment to mankind; for within a century pa&s;t, the opinion that the plague is propagated, in northern climates, by contagion only, &s;eems to have &s;u&s;pended all rational enquiries into the cau&s;e of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>That the fi&s;h on the Briti&s;h coa&s;t or in the rivers, peri&s;hed, during the la&s;t great plague in 1665, I find no where related, in a manner to render the fact certain; but I find Hodge has men|tioned a fact of that &s;ort as a proof that pe&s;tilence is occa&s;ioned by an unwhole&s;ome vapor from the earth.</P>
<P>The death of the haddock on the coa&s;t of Norway in 1789, has been already mentioned, but as there were many &s;hocks of earthquake in Scotland, about that period, it is not impo&s;&s;ible that the haddock might have been &s;uddenly killed by &s;ome concu&s;|&s;ion

A &s;imilar event took place on the American coa&s;t, in the great earthquake of November 1755, when &s;ome whales and multitudes of cod were killed, and &s;een afterwards floating on the water. I throw all &s;uch ca&s;es out of the que&s;tion, and confine my&s;elf to the &s;ickne&s;s and death of fi&s;h, when there has been no concu&s;&s;ion of the waters, to occa&s;ion a violent death.</P>
<P>The di&s;appearance of the blue-fi&s;h from Nantucket, in 1764, ju&s;t after the great mortality among the Indians, is a remarkable fact. Not le&s;s &s;ingular was the &s;ickne&s;s and extinction of the Wellfleet oy&s;ters in 1775, the year of a fatal dy&s;entery in Amer|ica. Still more remarkable was the &s;ickne&s;s or ill-&s;tate of the cod-fi&s;h taken on the banks of Newfoundland in the year 1788. They were thin, unfit for u&s;e and when pre&s;erved, turned to a blue or dark color.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle remarked that no one pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e appears to affect all kinds of fi&s;h; but that the&s;e animals are &s;ubject to &s;ick|ne&s;s, which is known by their being thin, and not changing their colors.</P>
<BIBL>De Hi&s;t. Animal. lib. 8. ca. 20.</BIBL>
<P>But to come &s;till nearer to the pre&s;ent time. In the years 1793 and 4, the oy&s;ters on the coa&s;t of Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;land, were all &s;ickly, watery, and ta&s;tele&s;s; wholly unfit for food, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, brought on nau&s;ea or &s;ickne&s;s in tho&s;e who ate of them. This was the very time when the &s;car|latina was &s;preading over the country, with malignant dy&s;entery and typhus.</P>
<P>The &s;had which came to the New-York market in the &s;pring of 1796, which was the period of pe&s;tilence in New-York, were leaner than u&s;ual, and peri&s;hed, in defiance of the powers of &s;alt.</P>
<P>In 1797, multitudes of &s;mall dead fi&s;h floated down James river in Virginia.

<P>I have been informed, that many dead &s;had were &s;een to float down the Su&s;quehanna, in June 1798; but of the fact, I have not &s;atisfactory evidence.</P>

<P>Sorbait relates that in the time of the plague at Vienna, I &s;up|po&s;e in 1679, a fountain in the &s;uburbs, which had been e&s;|teemed for the &s;alubrity of its waters, exhaled a &s;tench which appeared to increa&s;e the mortality in the vicinity. Van Swieten Vol. 16. 47. It is probable that Sorbait has mi&s;taken the ef|fect of this &s;tench; it is probable the great mortality in the vi|cinity and the impurity of the water proceeded both from one &s;ource, an uncommon effu&s;ion of &s;ubterranean vapor in that particular quarter, or other unknown cau&s;e.</P>
<P>All the&s;e phenomena denote a pe&s;tilential cau&s;e in water as well as air. Whether that cau&s;e is a po&s;itive &s;ub&s;tance infu&s;ed in|to the elements from &s;ubterranean regions, increa&s;ing the due proportion of oxygen; whether it is a negative &s;tate of the ele|ments, occa&s;ioned by the ab&s;traction of oxygen; or whether it is occa&s;ioned &s;imply by a chemical alteration in the elements, by the mechanical operation of the electric fluid, which may pro|duce new properties in air and water, by means of new combina|tions of their parts, are que&s;tions not ea&s;ily &s;olved. But with|out attempting to penetrate into the my&s;teries of nature, and un|fold primary cau&s;es, we may be certain of their effects, and from this branch of knowledge, may deduce u&s;eful conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>We know, for we &s;ee, the effects of &s;ome mortal principle, which, at particular periods, de&s;troys or impairs the u&s;ual powers of life, through the animal and vegetable kingdoms. We ration|ally conclude that this cau&s;e mu&s;t be general, affecting the ele|ments of life, over whole regions of the earth, and beneath the
<PB N="104" REF="036687_0459_100AA4458705E9A0">
waters of the ocean. Of &s;o much we are certain. As to the primary or remote cau&s;es, we &s;hall probably remain in the dark&mdash; and as to the proximate cau&s;es, we can only indulge a rational &s;pirit of philo&s;ophical enquiry, that may lead to probabilities.</P>
<P>Sydenham is among the mo&s;t re&s;pectable authorities for the doc|trin of a change in the properties of air from a &s;ubterraneous va|por. His words are, vol. 1. p. 8. Wallis's Edit. "There are various general con&s;titutions of years, that owe their origin neither to heat, cold, dryne&s;s nor moi&s;ture; but depend rather on a certain &s;ecret and inexplicable alteration in the bowels of the earth, whence the air becomes impregnated with &s;uch kinds of effluvia, as &s;ubject the human body to particular di&s;tempers, &s;o long as that kind of con&s;titution prevails, which after a cer|tain cour&s;e of years, declines and gives way to another."</P>
<P>The reader will recollect that when the plague fir&s;t broke out in Athens, the people alledged that their enemies had poi&s;oned the wells. In the mortal plague of 1349, the Germans &s;u&s;pec|ted the Jews had poi&s;oned the wells, and vented their rage upon the harmle&s;s I&s;raelites. The&s;e &s;u&s;picions doubtle&s;s aro&s;e from the bad quality of the waters, &s;imilar to what was ob&s;erved in New-Haven in 1795: And the &s;u&s;picion of poi&s;on was full as well founded, as the modern doctrin of importation, in mo&s;t ca&s;es of pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>The death of fi&s;h in rivers and the ocean, is one of the &s;trong|e&s;t arguments to prove the cau&s;e of pe&s;tilence to be a &s;ubtle va|por, expelled or exhaled from &s;ubterranean regions. That fi&s;h do in fact die of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, is a fact as well authentica|ted and as certain, as that epidemic di&s;ea&s;es affect the human race &mdash;and it is equally certain that &s;uch mortality among the fi&s;h, is u&s;ually cotemporary with pe&s;tilence among men, on the adja|cent &s;hores. From the&s;e facts, we are powerfully inclined to believe, the general cau&s;e which affects the one &s;pecies of animals, to be the &s;ame which affects the other &s;pecies. This conclu&s;ion is ea&s;y, natural and irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>What then can be the principle which penetrates the waters, and reaches the animal functions of fi&s;h and oy&s;ters on the bot|tom of the &s;ea? Can it be a vitiated &s;tate of the &s;uperincumbent
<PB N="105" REF="036687_0460_100AA448E177EEA0">
atmo&s;phere? Can a deleterious principle, belonging to the air, find its way through a ma&s;s of water, and de&s;troy life, as effectu|ally as in its natural fluid, on the &s;urface of the earth? The&s;e are que&s;tions, I pretend not to &s;olve. But cannot help thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">king that the only efficient cau&s;e, within our narrow comprehen&s;ion, capable of extending the principle of de&s;truction through the different elements, is the all-pervading energy of fire or electricity. The modus operandi is among the impenetrable arcana of the phy&s;ical world.</P>
<P>It may not be u&s;ele&s;s to introduce here an ob&s;ervation made by elderly people in America, that in &s;ickly years, the aurora bo|realis does not appear. It is certain that during the pre&s;ent pe&s;|tilential period, &s;ince 1790, that phenomenon has never been ob&s;erved, at lea&s;t not in any di&s;tingui&s;hed degree of brightne&s;s.</P>
<P>But the hi&s;tory of the aurora borealis does not warrant the ju&s;tne&s;s of this ob&s;ervation, as a general fact. The years 1564 and 5, which were di&s;tingui&s;hed by northern lights, were &s;ickly in Europe, and in many parts raged the plague. The &s;ame lights were very &s;plendid in November 1575, a year when the plague was &s;preading over Europe with unu&s;ual violence and mortality. The &s;ame were repeatedly ob&s;erved in 1580, the year of a mo&s;t &s;evere univer&s;al catarrh, when the plague raged in Paris, and when Cairo lo&s;t 500,000 people by the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e. The&s;e lights were again vi&s;ible in 1621, and de&s;cribed by Ga&s;&s;endus in France, who it is &s;aid gave them the name of <HI>aurora borealis.</HI> That year was noted for a mo&s;t fatal epidemic &s;mall-pox and the Hungarian fever in Europe; and the plague which raged among the Indians in America in 1618, had not cea&s;ed in 1621.</P>
<P>From this time to the year 1707, we have no account of the appearance of the&s;e lights. In that year, they appeared, but not of a remarkable brightne&s;s. If the&s;e lights appeared in this long interval, from 1621 to 1707, it is &s;trange that a&s;tronomers &s;hould have left us no account of them. Certain it is, that the great Halley never &s;aw this phenomenon till the year 1716, when he was 60 years old, and he began to de&s;pair of ever beholding it. During this long &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the aurora borealis, epidemic pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es occurred very often in both hemi&s;pheres.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="036687_0461_100AA44B288CA168">In the &s;ame interval, the&s;e lights were never &s;een in America; and our ance&s;tors, when they fir&s;t beheld them, at the beginning of this century, &s;uppo&s;ed them a new phenomenon in creation; the memory of them having been lo&s;t.</P>
<P>In 1719, in November, appeared the&s;e lights; which was at the commencement of a &s;ickly period of great &s;everity and extent &mdash;the plague was then raging in the Levant. A &s;plendid phe|nomenon of the &s;ame kind was ob&s;erved in Feb. 1720, the mo&s;t unhealthy year of that period. The &s;ame in the three following years, and in 1725, 1726, 1728, 1730, repeatedly in 1733, a &s;ickly year, repeatedly in 1735 and 36, very &s;ickly years, when the mortal &s;ore throat prevailed&mdash;al&s;o in 1737.</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts, we conclude that the cau&s;e of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, has no connection with the&s;e vi&s;ible phenomena of the electrical fluid, as they are ob&s;erved indifferently in healthy or &s;ickly years. It is evident however that the lumen boreale, is, in a certain degree, periodical.</P>
<P>Let us attend now to the effects of a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air and water, in the production of in&s;ects and &s;mall animals. This is one of the mo&s;t remarkable &s;ymptoms of a &s;ickly &s;tate of the elements, and it is the more nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t on this phenome|non, becau&s;e it is vi&s;ible to every eye, and carries with it, du|ring pe&s;tilence, a demon&s;tration of the doctrines for which I contend.</P>
<P>In the thre&s;hold of the hi&s;tory of plagues, we meet with ac|counts of myriads of noxious in&s;ects, accompanying the&s;e ca|lamities. The ten plagues of Egypt are numbered among the miraculous interpo&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions of providence, in favor of his cho&s;en people.

Germany, Poland and Ru&s;&s;ia. It is unnece&s;&s;ary here to enume|rate the in&s;tances related in the foregoing hi&s;tory, of the rava|ges of the&s;e animals; the reader has ob&s;erved that in&s;tances of their appearance have often occurred in different periods, and that they are always the harbingers or the companions of the plague.</P>
<P>This fact leaves no room to que&s;tion, that the &s;ame &s;tate of air in the oriental regions, which will generate epidemic di&s;|ea&s;es, will often produce tho&s;e animals in unu&s;ual numbers. They do not indeed always attend the plague; the particular &s;ea&s;on mo&s;t favorable to their generation is an exce&s;&s;ively dry one; but it is obvious, that they rarely appear in de&s;olating &s;warms, except in periods when the neighboring countries are afflicted with mortal epidemics.</P>
<P>It is true that, in two or three in&s;tances, hi&s;tory informs us, dreadful plagues have originated from the putrefaction of the&s;e animals&mdash;the in&s;tance of the pe&s;tilence on the African coa&s;t, about 126 years before the Chri&s;tian era, is memorable. But while this fact is not di&s;puted, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the &s;ame pe|riod was di&s;tingui&s;hed for pe&s;tilence in other countries, where no &s;uch local or particular cau&s;e exi&s;ted. Great &s;warms of locu&s;ts therefore in the ea&s;tern countries, <HI>may</HI> be the cau&s;e of pe&s;tilen|tial di&s;ea&s;es, but always by accident; whereas they are certainly the forerunners or companions of that calamity.</P>

<P>In the month of Augu&s;t, during a dreadful drouth at Bengal in 1770, which cut &s;hort the rice-crops and produced a terrible famin, and &s;ub&s;equent epidemic fever, the air was filled with a

cloud of in&s;ects, of the &s;ize of a hor&s;e-&s;tinger, with a long red body and large head; they continued to ob&s;cure the &s;un for &s;ome days, during which all toads, frogs and in&s;ects on the earth di&s;|appeared, but this cloud in the air did not de&s;cend to the earth.

<P>The pre&s;ent pe&s;tilential period in America was introduced by &s;uch multitudes of canker-worms and palmer-worms, as were never before known. Mu&s;quetoes have been the harbingers and attendants on the di&s;ea&s;es in New-York and Philadelphia in 1793, 1795 and 1798. In this latter year, the whole country has been over&s;pread with gra&s;s-hoppers, which very much injured the meadows, pa&s;tures and gardens.</P>
<P>On the&s;e facts I will ju&s;t remark, that they &s;erve to confirm the hi&s;torical truth of the &s;criptures. The whole &s;eries of facts, relative to the great plagues that have afflicted mankind, is a ti&s;|&s;ue of proofs, that the hi&s;tory of the ten plagues of Egypt was written on the &s;pot, and is a faithful record of facts. If the op|erations of nature are uniform, the &s;criptures cannot be a &s;puri|ous production. They de&s;cribe Egypt and Syria, as to every thing re&s;pecting climate and productions, preci&s;ely as they are at this day; and this fact is alone &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h their au|thenticity, again&s;t all the infidels on earth.</P>
<P>It may be impo&s;&s;ible to define preci&s;ely tho&s;e qualities of air and water which favor the production of unu&s;ual multitudes of any particular &s;ort of in&s;ects. It has been cu&s;tomary for writers to a&s;cribe them to <HI>putrefaction</HI> in the air; an indefinite and un|intelligible term. It is true that mu&s;quetoes and &s;ome other in|&s;ects are generated in hot, moi&s;t, &s;tagnant air, and in mar&s;hy places, when the putrefaction of vegetable and animal &s;ub&s;tances, is uncommonly rapid.

<P>Flies, on the contrary, are mo&s;t numerous in a hot and dry &s;ea&s;on. Moi&s;ture is ho&s;tile to their exi&s;tence; and in the year 1795, when the rainy &s;ea&s;on commenced about the 20th of July, preceding the fever in New-York, the flies almo&s;t wholly di&s;ap|peared, and were &s;ucceeded by mu&s;quetoes.

are the food of flies, but the &s;ea&s;ons mo&s;t favorable to putrefac|tion, do not always produce flies in the greate&s;t numbers.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, it is not po&s;&s;ible to account for the myriads of in|&s;ects which appear in particular years, on any known principles of the animal economy, or any vi&s;ible properties of air and wa|ter. If unu&s;ual numbers of a particular in&s;ect appear periodical|ly, as in ca&s;e of the canker-worms, tho I have not &s;atisfactory evidence of the regularity of <HI>their</HI> appearance, in uniform peri|ods, we &s;hould naturally conclude &s;uch animals to pa&s;s through other forms of exi&s;tence, and to re-appear in a particular noxious form, at the end of definite intervals of time. But were this the fact, it would &s;till remain a problem of a mo&s;t embarra&s;&s;ing difficulty, to di&s;cover the rea&s;on of their appearance in unhealthy periods only. For &s;uch is the fact, with mo&s;t of the in&s;ects, and their tran&s;migration, if admitted, will not in the lea&s;t help us to account for their exi&s;tence, in tho&s;e times only when the &s;tate of the air is unfriendly to human life.</P>
<P>But in truth, as to mo&s;t of the noxious in&s;ects which mark pe|riods of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, we know them not to change their forms of exi&s;tence, nor are the times of their appearance, peri|odical. On the other hand, we ob&s;erve they appear in &s;ickly pe|riods; and in unu&s;ual numbers, at no other time. We conclude therefore that a &s;tate of the elements, unfriendly to the health of man, is favorable to the generation of noxious in&s;ects, but with|out attempting to explain the particular properties of the elements, which po&s;&s;e&s;s that prolific power.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">May it not be the effect of excitement, owing to unu&s;ual electrical &s;timulus?</NOTE> All I contend for, by the&s;e facts, is, that the pe&s;tilential principle, whatever may be its na|ture or properties is a <HI>general</HI> principle, affecting all the elements of life, and that to this general cau&s;e are we to a&s;cribe the delete|rious di&s;ea&s;es which, at times, &s;pread over exten&s;ive regions of the earth.

<P>The order in which in&s;ects and di&s;ea&s;es appear, is not uniform; but it u&s;ually happens that the in&s;ects are the fir&s;t in order of time. This was the fact in 1770, when the flies clouded the heavens in

Bengal, and the worms darkened the earth in America. Such was the fact in 1791 when canker-worms in June gave to our orchards the a&s;pect of winter. But the whole progre&s;s of epi|demics is more or le&s;s marked by noxious and trouble&s;ome in&s;ects.</P>
<P>In 1798 and 1799, the meadows in &s;ome parts of Connecti|cut have been almo&s;t covered with &s;mall toads, of the &s;ize of a che&s;nut, and as de&s;cribed by Fernelius, "coloris cineritii," of the color of a&s;hes. The&s;e animals, in &s;uch numbers, are unu&s;u|al &mdash;they are not of the color of the common toad, and never grow to the &s;ame &s;ize. They come &s;uddenly and in a few weeks di&s;appear! Who knows their origin or their end? Fernelius numbered them, more than two centuries ago, among the pre&s;a|ges of pe&s;tilence, and we are witne&s;&s;es to the truth of his ob&s;er|vation.</P>
<P>If we attend to the &s;tate of a pe&s;tilential air, in re&s;pect to its effects on inanimate objects, we are furni&s;hed with further proofs, that epidemic di&s;ea&s;es are the production, not of fomites from the &s;ick, but of a general deleterious principle.</P>
<P>A remarkable in&s;tance of the corrupt or defective &s;tate of air, happened in the mortal plague of the year 252. See the de&s;crip|tion of it under that year.

<P>The air of New-York in 1795 produced a&s;toni&s;hing effects in the generation of mould, and the rapidity in the proce&s;s of pu|trefaction, in fle&s;h and vegetables, was almo&s;t incredible.</P>

<P>A &s;imilar fog or vapor during ea&s;terly winds, appeared in New-York, in September 1798, in the mo&s;t fatal period of the plague. Per&s;ons who felt and &s;aw it, de&s;cribe it as mo&s;t di&s;a|greeable to the &s;en&s;es; and its effects were very remarkable. The pavements of the &s;treets and other objects were covered with a coat of dew or mould, not however exactly re&s;embling either of tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances; not unlike perhaps the "ros tabidus," or "ros &s;anci &s;imilis," of the year 252. Its effects were equally wonderful on the leaves of trees, which were covered with &s;pots, which appeared as if corroded by an acid. And I have &s;een a cotton garment, which had been wa&s;hed, and hung out on the night of the fog, which was al&s;o covered with &s;pots of a dark, grey color, and which could not be taken out by any pro|ce&s;s of wa&s;hing. During this period al&s;o, iron railings and pump-handles were &s;uddenly covered over with &s;cales of ru&s;t, or a ferruginous color. The&s;e phenomena corre&s;pond with the effects of the pe&s;tilential air at Oczakow in 1739, in which &s;ur|gical in&s;truments became livid or black, as did the &s;ilver hilt of a &s;word.</P>
<P>The&s;e recent facts which have come under my own ob&s;erva|tion, have enabled me to give due credit to hi&s;torians, who men|tion &s;pots in garments, appearing &s;uddenly, during the plague. The writers who mention this phenomenon were mo&s;tly monks or other eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who&s;e relations are highly tinged with &s;u|per&s;tition; and as their imaginations have u&s;ually wrought up the&s;e appearances into the figure of a cro&s;s, or other chimerical

form, and a&s;cribed to them &s;ome miraculous qualities, I had pa&s;&s;ed over the pa&s;&s;ages with very &s;light con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I have however tran&s;cribed or rather abridged one of the&s;e accounts, under the head of plagues in the reign of Ju&s;tinian. It is from Warnefred, who relates that in the pe&s;tilence at Li|guria, the Genoe&s;e territory, there appeared &s;uddenly "quaedam &s;ignacula," certain &s;igns or &s;pots, on doors of hou&s;es, garments and uten&s;ils which could not be wa&s;hed out, but grew brighter by wa&s;hing. See the account in the foregoing hi&s;tory, under the de&s;cription of the plagues between 542 and 600. I recollect reading &s;everal other accounts of &s;imilar phenomena, which, for the rea&s;ons ju&s;t a&s;&s;igned, I neglected to tran&s;cribe when the au|thors were before me, which I now regret.</P>
<P>The celebrated Boyle mentions &s;imilar phenomena during pe&s;|tilence, and particularly an in&s;tance in Naples in the year 1660, which happened after an eruption of Ve&s;uvius, and which he a&s;cribes to a vapor. The vapor, he remarks, made impre&s;&s;ions of curious figures on garments; and he cites Thuanus and Kir|cher, as authorities for his opinion. See vol. 5. p. 60.</P>
<P>In the dreadful plague of 746, &s;imilar figures appeared on the garments of people, which the writer calls cruciculae, little cro&s;|&s;es, which &s;eemed as if drawn in oil. The&s;e marks excited no &s;mall terror, wherever they appeared.</P>
<BIBL>Paulus Diaconus, Aug. Hi&s;tory, p. 1012.</BIBL>
<P>Similar figures were impre&s;&s;ed on the bodies of the men who were employed by Julian to rebuild Jeru&s;alem in 362 or 3, and who were driven from their work by earthquakes and eruptions of fire. From the&s;e facts we may be led to a&s;cribe the forma|tion of &s;uch &s;pots to &s;ome electrical proce&s;s, or combination with an acid.</P>
<P>The&s;e phenomena indicate a peculiar &s;tate of the air, which is not common even during pe&s;tilence. It is a &s;tate which marks the highe&s;t degree of derangement in its ordinary healthful qual|ities, and &s;uch, as ble&s;&s;ed be God, does not often occur.</P>
<P>Another &s;trong proof of the doctrin here maintained of a pe&s;|tilential principle in the elements, is the well known fact, that du|ring the plague, fowls abandon the atmo&s;phere of the infected places.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="036687_0469_100AA45D65209BB0">Livy mentions that in the terrible plague in Rome, anno urbis conditae 571, not a vulture was to be &s;een for two years.</P>
<P>Dr. Gottwald remarks that in the Dantzick plague of 1709, &s;parrows, daws, &s;torks and &s;wallows de&s;erted the place for four months. Dr. Schelwig has recorded a &s;imilar fact; and Sorbait affirms that birds de&s;erted Vienna during the plague. Tho&s;e kept in cages died.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck has informed us that in the Holland plague of 1635 and 6 birds were unu&s;ually rare. He remarks that birds more readily perceive the poi&s;onous &s;tate of the air, and change their re&s;idence to places more &s;alubrious, even abandoning their ne&s;ts and their young. The &s;ame fact has been ob&s;erved by many med|ical and hi&s;torical writers.</P>
<P>The ancient phy&s;ician and compiler of medical &s;cience, Aetius, mentions, among the &s;igns of approaching pe&s;tilence, the death of birds and quadrupeds. If, &s;ays he, the circumambient air is the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, it will fir&s;t &s;how its effects in de&s;troying birds; if vitious exhalations from the earth, are the cau&s;e, quad|rupeds will be fir&s;t affected.</P>
<P>The fact goes to demon&s;trate that the pe&s;tilential principle per|vades the aerial fluid and is offen&s;ive to the delicate organs of fowls. It may be further mentioned, that the deleterious principle is often fatal to &s;mall birds in cages, before it is perceived by the human race. It is a curious and well authenticated fact, that in the prog|re&s;s of a plague, in cities, &s;mall birds &s;icken and die; and not long after, the people in the &s;ame hou&s;e, are &s;eized with the pe&s;ti|lence. Diemerbroeck was frequently an eye-witne&s;s to the fact, and he ob&s;erved, that wherever the &s;mall birds died in cages, the plague never failed, &s;ometime after and often in two or three days, to attack the inhabitants of the dwelling. This is another proof amounting to demon&s;tration, that the pe&s;tilential principle is a quality of the atmo&s;phere, and that it is <HI>progre&s;&s;ive in its malig|nity,</HI> having little or no dependence on the powers of contagion.</P>

cruel ravages, in &s;ea&s;ons apparently the mo&s;t temperate, and in places evidently the mo&s;t &s;alubrious.</P>
<P>The plague in 542, and in &s;ub&s;equent periods of the fifty years plague of Evagrius, a&s;cended to the tops of the hills and mountains. The terrible plague of 252, in the reign of Gal|lus and Volu&s;ian, invaded every village and almo&s;t every hou&s;e. The deadly plague of 1348 penetrated likewi&s;e to the mo&s;t healthy &s;pots on the globe and even to the regions of Greenland, &s;weeping away the human race, with undi&s;tingui&s;hing &s;everity.</P>
<P>Hildanus informs us that in the plague of Lau&s;anne, in 1613, the huts of the pea&s;ants on the hills and mountains were not ex|empt from the malady, tho detached and having no intercour&s;e with the infected. The &s;ame fact is recorded of the plague in 1720, which extended to the villages and mountains of Provence.</P>
<P>In the Trait&egrave; de la pe&s;te, p. 29, it is a&s;&s;erted that in the melancholy plague at Lyons in 1628, the filthie&s;t hou&s;es, the crouded places, narrow &s;treets and confined apartments, were places of the mo&s;t &s;afety; while the mo&s;t airy &s;ituations, as hou|&s;es on hills, were mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the ravages of the di&s;order. No place was exempt&mdash;the change of air was u&s;ele&s;s or perni|cious; in &s;ome ca&s;es, tho&s;e who enjoyed health in the impure air of the city, on removing into the country, were attacked with the malady. Malouin declares that the mo&s;t populous and dirty places in Lyons and Mar&s;eilles were lea&s;t affected with the plague.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts are very &s;ingular; yet it is not difficult to account for them, on the principle of a &s;uperabundance of oxygen, &s;tim|ulus, or principle of life in the atmo&s;phere. If, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, a u&s;ual cau&s;e of pe&s;tilential di&s;orders, is a too great quantity of oxygen in the air, producing fir&s;t the &s;tenic or inflammatory di|athe&s;is, and of cour&s;e indirect debility, then tho&s;e places mu&s;t be mo&s;t healthy, in &s;uch a general &s;tate of the air, where there is the &s;malle&s;t proportion of oxygen. This remark however is a mere conjecture; and the facts related of the plague in Ly|ons &s;tand as an exception to a very general rule, that the mo&s;t filthy, unventilated places &s;uffer mo&s;t &s;everely by all kinds of pe&s;tilential maladies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Lyons, tanners and curriers e&s;caped the plague, as did tho&s;e who clean&s;ed &s;ewers and privies.

<P><PB N="116" REF="036687_0471_100AA462E618DA78">It is al&s;o true in general, that the poor, who inhabit narrow &s;treets and alleys, amid&s;t filthy &s;ub&s;tances, &s;uffer more by malig|nant complaints than the rich, who live in wider &s;treets, and more airy, cleanly hou&s;es.

<P>While it may be difficult to a&s;&s;ign preci&s;e rea&s;ons for &s;uch dif|ferences in the operation of the principle of de&s;truction, the facts prove that this principle con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ome hidden qualities of the elements, and does not ari&s;e from any of the ordinary vi&s;ible cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e. Riverius is explicit on this point. He avers that pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es often occur, without any apparent change in the vi&s;ible qualities of the air, and when the air <HI>appears</HI> to be more pure than at other times, when no &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es prevail.</P>
<BIBL>Lib. 17.</BIBL>
<P>Further, altho it is generally true that pe&s;tilence is attended and greatly augmented in violence by &s;ome peculiarity in the &s;ea|&s;ons, as exce&s;&s;ive heat and moi&s;ture or drouth, yet to this there are frequent exceptions. The reader may turn back to an in|&s;tance of this, recorded by Livy and other Latin hi&s;torians, in which it was remarked as a matter of &s;urpri&s;e, that a violent plague, and one of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive kind, &s;hould a&s;&s;ail the city of Rome, in a mild, temperate &s;ea&s;on. A &s;imilar ob&s;erva|tion was made re&s;pecting the plague in Paris in 1580. The &s;ummer was temperate and the fruits good. No vi&s;ible cau&s;e could be a&s;&s;igned for the malady. Yet a mo&s;t certain, or rather an infallible &s;ymptom of a deranged &s;tate of the elements, had occurred in that year; I mean a mo&s;t &s;evere univer&s;al influ|enza. Hence it appears, that altho peculiar &s;ea&s;ons may prodi|giou&s;ly increa&s;e, and perhaps produce a pe&s;tilence; yet the gen|eral cau&s;e is often &s;ome principle which has no dependence on &s;ea&s;on or changes of weather. In the la&s;t London plague, in 1665, &s;ays Hodge, the &s;ea&s;on was mild, the heat moderate, and fruits abundant and good.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="036687_0472_100AA4656BE08B40">We have, in America, proofs of the truth of this doctrin. The la&s;t pe&s;tilential period commenced with the mea&s;les in 1789 and &s;evere epidemic influenza in 1789 and 90; and has already continued ten years. Some of the &s;ummers, during this period, have been very temperate, as tho&s;e of 1794 and 1797. Yet ev|ery &s;ummer has produced the pe&s;tilential fever of our climate; and even our winters have exhibited &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;es which prevail in &s;ummer. Not one year, even the mo&s;t temper|ate, of the whole period, has failed to &s;how the predominant di|athe&s;is of the pe&s;tilence. The &s;ultry dry &s;ummers of 1793 and 98, and the &s;ultry humid &s;ummer of 1795, have rendered the di&s;ea&s;es more violent and fatal in the northern &s;tates.</P>
<P>Yet in the more favorable &s;ea&s;ons of 1794, 96 and 97, the morbid cau&s;e produced its effects in New-Haven, Providence, Newburyport and Bo&s;ton, as well as in Baltimore, Norfolk and Charle&s;ton.</P>
<P>Hence we ob&s;erve that the elemental cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;es of this period, may be, in &s;ome degree, modified, but not control|led or &s;ubdued by the mo&s;t temperate and favorable &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Indeed all writers of reputation on this &s;ubject agree, in this one opinion, that the plague cannot be a&s;cribed, either to intem|perate &s;ea&s;ons, or to putrefaction, or to any &s;pecies of exhalations from animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances. The&s;e are allowed to be &s;econdary cau&s;es, operating to modify or vary the operation of the primary cau&s;e; but one uniform &s;eries of ob&s;ervations from the beginning of hi&s;tory to this day, has driven medical writers from the defencele&s;s ground of intemperate weather, and putrid exhalations.</P>
<P>Hippocrates learnt that pe&s;tilence could not be a&s;cribed &s;olely to vi&s;ible cau&s;es; he therefore admits <HI>to theion,</HI> &s;omething divine, or beyond human inve&s;tigation, to be a primary cau&s;e of this ca|lamity.</P>
<P>Tacitus informs us that the plague in the time of Nero could not be a&s;cribed to any vi&s;ible intemperature in the &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Fernelius ob&s;erves that altho immoderate heat augments the plague and every acute di&s;ea&s;e, yet he had known an exce&s;&s;ively hot &s;ea&s;on, pa&s;s off without producing pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es. He

agrees with Diemerbroeck, that the cau&s;e mu&s;t be &s;ome unknown principle, "inquinamentum e coelo demi&s;&s;um," &s;ome cau&s;e of corruption in the atmo&s;phere, which is infu&s;ed into it from the ce|le&s;tial regions. This is cutting the gordian knot. The&s;e authors are doubtle&s;s right, in rejecting the vi&s;ible qualities of the air, ex|halations and intemperate &s;ea&s;ons, as the primary cau&s;es of the plague; but they fly from earth into the boundle&s;s regions of &s;pace, for a cau&s;e which is more probably beneath their feet, or around their bodies.</P>

<P>Pro&s;per Alpinus, who lived &s;ome time in Egypt and had an op|portunity to make per&s;onal ob&s;ervations on the di&s;ea&s;es of that country, maintains that the plague rarely ari&s;es from corrupt air, and never, unle&s;s when the Nile has exceeded its u&s;ual limits in its inundations. If, &s;ays this writer, the di&s;ea&s;e proceeded from noxious exhalations from putrid &s;tagnant waters and mar&s;hes, it would occur every year, which is contrary to fact. Hence he concludes the di&s;ea&s;e to be u&s;ually imported into Egypt from Greece, Syria and Barbary. In this opinion, he has been fol|lowed by a whole tribe of unob&s;erving travellers; who &s;tupidly forget that by tracing the di&s;temper from Egypt to Syria or Bar|bary, they never come nearer to its &s;ource.

But why &s;uppo&s;e this &s;ource of the di&s;ea&s;e to exi&s;t in Con&s;tanti|nople only? Why not the &s;ame &s;ource forever exi&s;t in Egypt, for there al&s;o infected clothes are never purified. In &s;hort, from Pro&s;per Alpinus to Mead and Cullen, all the rea&s;onings and a&s;|&s;ertions of authors on the origin of the plague, argue either im|potence of mind, want of ob&s;ervation or extreme prejudice.</P>
<P>So far as this, Alpinus is right, that exhalations alone from &s;tagnant waters and mar&s;hes will not ordinarily generate the plague; but aided by &s;ome general primary cau&s;e in the elements, &s;uch ex|halations do produce the plague, and in no country more frequent|ly than in Egypt.</P>
<P>Gibbon alleges this di&s;ea&s;e to proceed from hot, damp, &s;tag|nant air, drawing this conclu&s;ion probably from the origination of the terrible plague of 542, in the foul regions near Pelu&s;ium in Egypt, and in the vicinity of a large mar&s;h. But if this were the only cau&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to produce the di&s;order, as Alpi|nus ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, it would occur regularly every year, for every hot &s;ea&s;on generates putrid exhalations in ample abundance, and in every hot climate, will be found annual returns of hot, damp, &s;tagnant air, The cau&s;es therefore a&s;&s;igned by Gibbon are inad|equate to the effect.</P>
<P>In America, beyond almo&s;t any other country, we have the mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible arguments again&s;t this opinion. No country on earth, not excepting the rice plantations on the river Bengal, pre|&s;ents &s;uch an immen&s;e region of &s;tagnant waters, and fetid mar&s;h|es, as the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the United States, from the Delaware to Florida. The &s;outhern extremity of this region is in a cli|mate always warm; and the whole of it is expo&s;ed to burning heat, for four months in the year. Yet the true, "pe&s;tis ingui|naria," of the oriental countries has never appeared in this coun|try, as an epidemic; and the &s;pecies of the plague which occurs, and which I call <HI>bilious</HI> or <HI>American,</HI> appears as rarely amid&s;t the mar&s;hes of Carolina, as in the northern cities, which are expo|po&s;ed to no mar&s;h exhalations.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="036687_0475_100AA46C03E99258">Now if hot, damp, &s;tagnant air, and putrid exhalations alone were adequate to the production of this bilious plague, it mu&s;t be produed every year, in a multitude of places on the American coa&s;t; whereas in fact, that di&s;ea&s;e rarely occurs, as an epidem|ic, even on the flat lands of Carolina and Georgia; and never is very exten&s;ively mortal, except when the northern &s;tates, which are &s;ituated on high, rocky, gravelly and dry lands, and who&s;e air and water are of the mo&s;t pure and &s;alubrious kind, are afflic|ted al&s;o with malignant epidemic di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>This is a remarkable fact and one on which I will venture to re&s;t the whole argument. In no in&s;tance, has the city of Charle&s;ton, &s;ituated on an immen&s;e flat, &s;urrounded by the mar&s;hes of A&s;hley and Cooper rivers, been &s;everely troubled with a contagious bilious epidemic, except when the &s;ea&s;ons have been &s;ickly in the northern &s;tates. Witne&s;s the years 1699, 1728, 1732, 1739, 1745, 1748, 1796. I &s;peak not of &s;po|radic ca&s;es among &s;trangers that vi&s;it the &s;outhern &s;tates, for the&s;e may occur every year.</P>
<P>The Europeans might, had they not been blinded by the fal&s;e notions of contagion, long ago have di&s;covered the &s;ame import|ant truth; for what is called a great plague in Egypt or Syria, never occurs, except during the prevalence of malignant epi|demics all over Europe, even to the Baltic. Lighter epidemics occur in Egypt and Con&s;tantinople, in any uncommon &s;ea&s;on; and &s;o does the ordinary autumnal bilious fever, in all our &s;outh|ern &s;tates. The&s;e are di&s;orders which may be excited, in any place and any &s;ea&s;on, by the action of heat on vegetable &s;ub&s;tan|ces in &s;tagnant water, or by the local impurities which always exi&s;t in populous cities. But the&s;e ordinary di&s;ea&s;es do not put on the malignant &s;pmptoms which characterize the di&s;tempers of pe&s;tilential periods&mdash;they do not exhibit infection. On the other hand, when the di&s;ea&s;es of Egypt a&s;&s;ume contagious and deadly &s;ymptoms and &s;pread de&s;olation over that country, we &s;hall al|ways find the northern parts of Europe, more or le&s;s afflicted with the &s;ame or other malignant di&s;orders. The pe&s;tilential principle, in greater or le&s;s degrees of violence, extends over the whole European world, and not unfrequently over the A|merican continent.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="036687_0476_100AA46E1B2C4898">Thus, altho the plague does not, in modern times, appear in the north of Europe, at lea&s;t not often, yet all the great plagues in the Levant are vi&s;ible, if I may indulge the expre&s;&s;ion, in the augmented bills of mortality in London, Am&s;terdam, and the Baltic cities. Witne&s;s the pe&s;tilential periods of 1720, of 1736 to 1740, of 1760 to 1763. Even the le&s;s violent pe&s;tilences of 1772 and 3, and of 1784 to 1786, have been marked by epidemics in England and Scotland. And, in the la&s;t &s;eries of epidemics, the years 1792, 93 and 95, which have been di&s;tingui&s;hed for the plague in the ea&s;t, as well as anginas and plague in America, exhibit a con&s;iderable increa&s;e of mortality in London.</P>
<P>All the&s;e facts &s;erve as evidence of the truth of what the medical writers of the fifteenth, &s;ixteenth and &s;eventeenth cen|turies have unanimou&s;ly advanced, that the primary cau&s;e of pe&s;tilence is &s;ome invi&s;ible quality in the elements, altogether di&s;tinct from corrupt air, or mar&s;h exhalations.</P>
<P>It is a remark of the Arabian phy&s;icians, that an indi&s;po&s;ition of the air is nece&s;&s;ary, in the hotte&s;t climates, to enforce the ac|tion of putrid effluvia on the human body to produce the plague.</P>
<BIBL>Mead, 248.</BIBL>
<P>Dr. Mead him&s;elf, while he maintains that the putrefaction of animal &s;ub&s;tances, with un&s;ea&s;onable moi&s;tures, heats and want of winds, produces the plague, and while he contends that no kind of putrefaction in European countries, is ever heightened to a degree capable of producing the true plague, admits that a corrupted &s;tate of air is nece&s;&s;ary to give the contagious atoms their full force, otherwi&s;e the plague could never cea&s;e, but with the extinction of mankind. That is, he holds the plague never to appear in European northern countries, without contagion, but that the contagion would remain inert, without a corrupt &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>The ab&s;urd opinion, that northern climates will not generate the &s;tate of air which occa&s;ions a pe&s;tilence, but that a pe&s;tilen|tial germ, or leaven, mu&s;t be imported from Egypt or other &s;outhern latitude, has been adopted by mo&s;t of the Briti&s;h med|ical writers, and by a numerous part of the phy&s;icians in the
<PB N="122" REF="036687_0477_100AA46FA1094A68">
United States. It is hard to &s;ay whether the followers of Mead are the more &s;ervile, or their opinion, the more unphilo|&s;ophical. But for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, it is &s;ufficient that even the advocates for the propagation of the plague by a &s;pecific contagion, admit that this cau&s;e is not adequate to the effect, and that they are compelled to &s;ummon to their aid a general princi|ple of corruption in the air, to account for its propagation in northern climates. This conce&s;&s;ion of the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a principle, by whatever name it may be called, is all I a&s;k.</P>
<P>It is on this principle only, we can reconcile the differing ac|counts of authors, in regard to the effect of putrefying bodies after battles, in producing pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es; &s;ome alleging that &s;uch corrupting bodies will produce the plague, and others denying the fact. Julius Alexandrinus, Diodorus Siculus and other authors, relate that plagues have ari&s;en from the putrefac|tion of dead bodies after battles. Three or four in&s;tances occur in the foregoing hi&s;tory, of plagues a&s;cribed to the putrefaction of dead locu&s;ts. Fore&s;tus relates that a dead whale, ca&s;t upon the &s;hore of Holland, occa&s;ioned an exten&s;ive pe&s;tilence in Eg|mont. See Hieronymus, Agu&s;tinus, Sabellicus, Walfius, An|gelus, Paraeus, and Agricola, who have recorded &s;imilar facts, as cited by Diemerbroeck de pe&s;te.</P>
<P>Dr. Gottwald relates that the plague which &s;pread over the north of Europe from 1702 to 1711, originated near Pickzow, &s;oon after the unfortunate battle between the Saxons and Swedes; but he &s;ays nothing of putrefying bodies, nor does he a&s;cribe the di&s;ea&s;e to that cau&s;e.</P>
<BIBL>Baddam's Mem. 6. 5.</BIBL>
<P>At the &s;ame time, it it equally true, that thou&s;ands of dead bodies after battles have peri&s;hed unburied, without producing any &s;uch effect. In 1642, eight thou&s;and dead &s;oldiers and innumerable carca&s;es of hor&s;es, after a battle in the Duchy of Juliers, were left to putrefy on the &s;urface of the earth, cau&s;ing an intolerable &s;tench, but producing no pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e. The &s;ame fact happened often, &s;ays Diemerbroeck, p. 31, in the cruel wars, between the Swedes and Imperiali&s;ts, in his days; and we know that other hi&s;torians have related &s;imilar facts.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="036687_0478_100AA471D707A910">Whenever a malignant di&s;ea&s;e follows &s;uch an exten&s;ive pu|trefaction, Diemerbroeck alleges, the di&s;ea&s;e to be only a pe&s;ti|lential fever, but not the true plague. Or if, in any in&s;tance, the true plague follows, he maintains the putrefaction to be only a &s;econdary cau&s;e. This is probably a near approach to the truth. The whole my&s;tery is unfolded, on my principles, which teach the exi&s;tence of a di&s;ordered or pe&s;tilential &s;tate of the elements, at particular times. If the putrefaction of dead bodies takes place during the&s;e periods, when the animal func|tions are debilitated, or impaired, and the human body, prone to di&s;ea&s;e, the corruption of fle&s;h may &s;o far vitiate the atmo&s;|phere as to produce pe&s;tilence. But if thou&s;ands of dead bodies putrefy on the earth, when the air is in its natural &s;tate, &s;alu|brious and adapted to the &s;upport of health, and when the hu|man body is in full vigor to re&s;i&s;t the effects of the foul effluvia, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible for any quantity of di&s;&s;olving fle&s;h to evolve a poi&s;on, adequate to the production of pe&s;tilential di&s;orders, and certainly not &s;ufficient to occa&s;ion an exten&s;ive epidemic.</P>
<P>An attention to this di&s;tinction will al&s;o reconcile all the differ|ences of opinion, and all the contradictory phenomena which re|gard the effects of vegetable effluvia, and the impure air of cities.</P>
<P>Why, it has been triumphantly a&s;ked by the advocates of im|ported fomites, did not the filthy &s;treets and putrefying vegetables of New-York and Philadelphia, produce the bilious pe&s;tilence, in former years? For many years, we recollect, more foul &s;treets and docks, much greater accumulations of filth, yet the&s;e produced not the contagious fever which has lately de&s;olated our cities.</P>
<P>Such are the facts, I admit; and the &s;ame will again take place, when the period of pe&s;tilence &s;hall be clo&s;ed, and the la|tent di&s;orders of the elements, corrected. But there has exi&s;ted, &s;ince 1789, a univer&s;al defect in the healthful powers of the ele|ments, clearly evidenced by a &s;eries of &s;evere epidemics, the in|fluenza and &s;carlatina, the increa&s;ed violence of the &s;ymptoms of ordinary di&s;tempers; by the imperfection of fruits; by the &s;ick|ne&s;s and death of fi&s;h, fowls and cats, with many di&s;orders a|mong other animals. The moment this &s;tate of the elements oc|curs, the local impurities which always exi&s;t in cities, and which
<PB N="124" REF="036687_0479_100AA47484FF8A80">
produce only ordinary di&s;ea&s;es, in a healthful di&s;po&s;ition of the elements, give to tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es new virulence and a contagious quality. The whole &s;ecret to be unfolded, is, that the autum|nal di&s;ea&s;es, under the debilitating operation of a general derange|ment of the elements, acquire unu&s;ually &s;evere &s;ymptoms, a wi|der exten&s;ion, and the quality of contagion or what I call infec|tion. The&s;e phenomena excite the a&s;toni&s;hment of men, who have not attended to the hi&s;tory of pe&s;tilence, in which they might have found the means of &s;olving the difficulty; for &s;imilar facts have marked the progre&s;s of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, from the days of Mo&s;es to this hour.</P>
<P>I would further ob&s;erve that from univer&s;al ob&s;ervation, it ap|pears, that during that &s;tate of air, which produces contagious di&s;ea&s;es in unu&s;ual numbers, all kinds of fle&s;h and vegetables are more apt to putrefy, than in a healthy &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere. This was ob&s;erved by Diemerbroeck in the Holland plague of 1636; and we have had many proofs of it in America, within a few years pa&s;t. And this is evidently true not only of fre&s;h animal meat, but al&s;o of &s;alted meats of all kinds. The powers of &s;alt appear to be in&s;ufficient to pre&s;erve fle&s;h and fi&s;h, again&s;t the &s;trong tendency to di&s;&s;olution, which &s;eems to attend them in certain years. Hence we &s;o frequently hear of &s;poiled beef and pork, and fi&s;h during &s;ickly periods.</P>
<P>In &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, it appears to be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to keep pro|vi&s;ions, de&s;tined for a foreign market. This effect on fle&s;h and fi&s;h may proceed either from unu&s;ual heat and moi&s;ture in the air, or from an obvious imperfection or &s;ickly &s;tate of the animals; and perhaps, independent of the&s;e cau&s;es, it may proceed &s;ometimes from the &s;ame invi&s;ible principle in the properties of air, which originates new and malignant &s;ymptoms of di&s;ea&s;e in the human body; a mere exce&s;s of &s;timulus.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the cau&s;e, the effect is obvious; and the unexpected putrefaction of &s;alted meats, has often been among the cau&s;es which have generated or augmented pe&s;tilential di&s;tem|pers in America. Such an in&s;tance is mentioned at New-Haven in 1794, where a quantity of putrid fi&s;h was thrown into the dock, and was exce&s;&s;ively offen&s;ive, ju&s;t before the appearance of
<PB N="125" REF="036687_0480_100AA476AE969320">
the pe&s;tilential fever. In New-York, the la&s;t &s;ummer, the pe&s;ti|lence evidently received great force and malignancy from large quantities of beef and pork which &s;poiled in &s;tores and cellars. A &s;imilar cau&s;e is &s;uppo&s;ed to have excited or increa&s;ed the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e in Bo&s;ton and New-London. The putrefaction of re|mains of great multitudes of the fi&s;h called Menhaden, on the wharves in Newburyport, in 1796, was obviou&s;ly a powerful ex|citing cau&s;e of the di&s;order in that town.</P>
<P>In &s;uch ca&s;es, putrefaction is more rapid, and its &s;tench more poi&s;onous, than under a healthful con&s;titution of the atmo&s;phere. This accelerated di&s;&s;olution of fle&s;h is the <HI>effect</HI> of the common principle of di&s;ea&s;e, and in its turn, becomes the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Hence we may ob&s;erve, that it is only during a &s;ickly &s;tate of the elements, that putrefaction is ever known to excite pe&s;tilen|tial epidemics; for almo&s;t every man has ob&s;erved, many times, that the &s;ame quantities of putrefying fle&s;h, in periods of health, produce no &s;uch di&s;tempers. It is this circum&s;tance which has puzzled all &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers, and furni&s;hed the advocates of imported infection, with &s;trong ground to maintain their errors. They allege, "the &s;ame cau&s;es have not always produced the &s;ame effects. As putrefaction and filth have not, at other times and always, produced di&s;ea&s;es in our climate, therefore they do not produce the pe&s;tilential fever of the pre&s;ent time, and it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be occa&s;ioned by imported fomites." The&s;e men have not at|tended to &s;imilar facts in all other countries and in all ages. The &s;ame argument would prove that no pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e can be gen|erated any where; for it is as true of the We&s;t-Indies, of E|gypt and Con&s;tantinople, as it is of the United States, that pu|trefaction does not, every year and at all times, produce pe&s;ti|lence. In this fact agree all authors who have written on the cau&s;es of the plague. And there is rea&s;on to believe, with Die|merbroeck, that putrefaction <HI>alone</HI> never produces the plague; but that whenever it is the <HI>apparent exciting</HI> cau&s;e, there concurs with it a general &s;ickly &s;tate of the air; which not being vi&s;ible, mankind a&s;cribe the whole effect to putrefaction.</P>
<P>In the United States, it is a very curious fact, that this &s;ick|ly &s;tate of the elements has been progre&s;&s;ive, as I have par|ticularly
<PB N="126" REF="036687_0481_100AA478BA7A1BA8">
proved, in the preceding pages, which progre&s;&s;ion was clearly marked by the increa&s;e of mortality by the &s;carlatina, and other di&s;ea&s;es of unu&s;ual malignity. In every in&s;tance, the epidemic pe&s;tilential fever, tho &s;aid to ari&s;e from putrid fle&s;h, has kept pace with this in&s;alubrious &s;tate of air. For example, while Philadelphia was ravaged by the plague in 1793, the &s;carlatina was prevalent in New-York; but the ea&s;tern &s;tates were exempt, and felt no inconvenience from the pe&s;tilential &s;tate of the air, unle&s;s in a few &s;poradic ca&s;es of autumnal fever, of aug|mented violence, which indicated a <HI>commencement</HI> of the epidemic con&s;titution. In 1794, this con&s;titution arrived to its <HI>cri&s;is</HI> in Connecticut, moving ea&s;tward in its progre&s;s; and at New-Haven appeared the pe&s;tilential fever, &s;oon after its precur&s;or, the &s;carlatina. Now whether we &s;uppo&s;e the pe&s;tilence to be from imported fomes, or from the putrid fi&s;h and clams in the docks, it is remarkable that it did not occur till the &s;tate of air was evidently &s;ickly, and ill-fitted to &s;upport life, as appeared by the malignant dy&s;entery in the vicinity, and by the univer&s;al prevalence of &s;carlatina. This is a curious and important fact.</P>
<P>Proceeding ea&s;tward we ob&s;erve the &s;ame truth. The pe&s;ti|lential fever at Newburyport was &s;aid to be excited by the putrid garbage of fi&s;h&mdash;true, but this effect did not take place in 1793, when the fever was laying wa&s;te Philadelphia; nor in 1795, when the &s;ame fever prevailed in New-York. Why? evidently becau&s;e the con&s;titution of air in the ea&s;tern &s;tates, had not then arrived to its cri&s;is of malignancy. But moving ea&s;tward, the &s;carlatina began to &s;how it&s;elf there in 1795, and in 1796 was more general and fatal in all the adjacent country. Then follow|ed the pe&s;tilential fever, both in Bo&s;ton and Newburyport. So that if we admit the di&s;ea&s;e to be of imported origin, or &s;uppo&s;e it to ari&s;e from putrid exhalations, we are &s;till compelled to admit the concurrence of &s;ome general cau&s;e in the production of the di&s;ea&s;e, becau&s;e we never know this pe&s;tilence to appear, but when other di&s;ea&s;es and phenomena demon&s;trate the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a cau&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that putrid fi&s;h might not have exi&s;ted, in other years, in &s;ituations to expo&s;e the inhabitants; I an&s;wer, that with|in my ob&s;ervation, in numberle&s;s in&s;tances, immen&s;e quantities of the entrails of fi&s;h are left to putrefy on the &s;hores of our rivers, every year, with an intolerable &s;tench, but without producing the lea&s;t ap|pearance of di&s;ea&s;e.</NOTE> In Philadelphia, in New-Haven, and in almo&s;t eve|ry

place, the pe&s;tilential fever has followed clo&s;e upon the heels of that malignant di&s;temper, the &s;carlet fever.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the duration of this general con&s;titution of air, we can determin nothing, but by the event. We ob&s;erve in hi&s;tory, that &s;uch pe&s;tilential periods are of various length, from three to fifteen years, or perhaps for a longer time; during which, di&s;ea&s;es are multiplied and augmented; and all bearing &s;ome peculiar &s;ymptoms, that characterize that con&s;titution or &s;tate of the elements. On this &s;ubject the treati&s;e of Sydenham is invaluable.</P>
<P>There remains one other view of this &s;ubject to be con&s;idered in this &s;ection&mdash;this is, the connection of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es with famin.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t authors have remarked that famin is a cau&s;e of pe&s;|tilence, and have cited the old Greek adage, <HI>o loimos meta limon,</HI> pe&s;tis po&s;t famem, the plague follows famin.</P>
<P>It is a ju&s;t remark that the true plague often follows a dearth of provi&s;ions; it is more frequently true, that &s;carcity is followed by di&s;ea&s;es of a le&s;s malignant type But it is equally true that this order is often inverted, and famin follows pe&s;tilence. It is more frequently true that pe&s;tilence is neither preceded nor followed by any &s;carcity of provi&s;ions. In&s;tances of all the&s;e facts appear in the preceding hi&s;tory. The conclu&s;ion is inevitable, that the plague proceeds from &s;ome other cau&s;e, than a deficient or &s;u|perabundant quantity of food, for it often occurs, independent of either of the&s;e circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Thus Morellus, de feb. pe&s;t. lib. 3, relates an in&s;tance, where no pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es &s;ucceeded a &s;evere famin. Galen men|tions an in&s;tance of a &s;evere famin which followed as &s;evere a plague in Rome, yet the famin did not again excite the plague.</P>
<P>De Pauw, in his Philo&s;ophical Di&s;&s;ertations on the Egyptians and Chine&s;e, vol. 1. 87, an&s;wers and refutes the Abbe Four|mont who alleged famin to be the cau&s;e of the plague.</P>
<P>"By exact annotations, &s;ays De Pauw, continued during
<PB N="128" REF="036687_0483_100AA47CE4938E50">
twenty-eight years, we find the plague has raged in Egypt five times, without being preceded by any &s;carcity of food, and con|trary to what I once &s;u&s;pected, unre&s;tricted to a periodical cour&s;e." We know al&s;o in America, that &s;carcity of food can have had no influence in producing the numerous epidemic and pe&s;tilential di&s;orders of the la&s;t nine years.</P>
<P>On this &s;ubject Diemerbroeck has a very ju&s;t remark, and one that &s;olves all the difficulties that might &s;eem to ari&s;e from the differing accounts of the effects of famin. He &s;ays "Non om|nem, &s;ed illam tantum famem &s;equitur pe&s;tis, quae fames et ip&s;a a pe&s;tilentiae cau&s;a originem &s;umit, (dum a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ea cau&s;a primo fru|ges terrae corrumpuntur, po&s;tea pe&s;tis inducitur,) ita ut fames illa non &s;it cau&s;a pe&s;tis, &s;ed ip&s;amet eandem cum pe&s;te cau&s;am habeat."</P>
<BIBL>De pe&s;te, page 30.</BIBL>
<P>"For the plague does not follow every famin; but that only which ari&s;es from the &s;ame cau&s;e as the plague; (for by that cau&s;e the fruits of the earth are fir&s;t vitiated and afterwards the plague &s;ucceeds) &s;o that the famin is not the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of the plague, but proceeds it&s;elf from the &s;ame cau&s;e."</P>
<P>Whenever there exi&s;ts a general cau&s;e in the elements, un|friendly to the health of the human race, and at the &s;ame time, to the growth and perfection of grain, pe&s;tilence and famin may be companions of each other; or they may reciprocally follow each other, according as the general cau&s;e operates fir&s;t on ve|getables or on mankind. In &s;uch ca&s;es, &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers are apt to &s;uppo&s;e one to be the cau&s;e of the other, when in fact, they are both the offspring of a common cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In long &s;ieges, bad food is often a powerful cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e, as in the &s;iege of Mar&s;eilles by Julius Ce&s;ar, before Chri&s;t 48. Ce&s;ar, De bel. civ. lib. 2. 20. In &s;uch ca&s;es, the bad qualities of the corn or bread, are not natural defects in the growth, but the effects of age, heat, moi&s;ture and decay.</P>
<P>Fortunately, the improved &s;tate of agriculture has rendered a dearth of grain, a rare occurrence. In de&s;potic governments, where indu&s;try of every kind langui&s;hes, and men &s;eldom make provi&s;ion for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence beyond the pa&s;&s;ing moment, famin is not unfrequent in modern times, as in Syria after the terribly &s;evere
<PB N="129" REF="036687_0484_100AA47EEC2EFD48">
winter of 1756-7, when the crops failed, and parents devoured their children, or offered them for &s;ale in market to procure food. But &s;uch is the &s;tate of agriculture, in free countries, that crops are le&s;s liable to fail, than formerly; and when they fall &s;hort in a particular country, commerce may u&s;ually &s;upply the deficiency from &s;ome other climate. A univer&s;al failure of grain, even under the mo&s;t unfavorable di&s;po&s;ition of the elements, mu&s;t be a rare phenomenon.</P>
<P>Yet with all our improvements in agriculture and commerce, we are not to calculate with certainty that we are never to feel the &s;courge of famin. There has been, within about a century, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ea&s;ons when the earth failed to yield her accu&s;|tomed quantity of vegetable food. Such were the la&s;t years of the la&s;t century, when corn was cut &s;hort by mildew and bla&s;t, not in one country only, but in mo&s;t countries. Multitudes per|i&s;hed in the north of Europe, and our forefathers in America ob&s;erved, that for a number of years, the very cour&s;e of nature &s;eemed to be altered.</P>
<P>The beginning of the &s;eventeenth century was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;till more exten&s;ive and &s;evere dearth, which afflicted all Eu|rope, and cut off a large portion of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>In the year 1783, the dearth in Scotland was &s;o &s;evere that commerce alone &s;aved thou&s;ands from peri&s;hing; and &s;o late as the year 1790, our own country experienced a &s;carcity that excited univer&s;al alarm. Both of the&s;e periods were di&s;tingui&s;hed for &s;evere famin in Egypt, Bengal and the Carnatic.</P>
<P>Such facts &s;how us the all-powerful influence of the invi&s;ible energies of nature, and how little avail human efforts, to avoid the fatal con&s;equences of a univer&s;al failure in their operation. That the principles of vegetation do thus fail, at certain times, over large portions of the globe, is an unque&s;tionable truth; it is equally certain, that &s;uch events are intimately connected with the cau&s;e of pe&s;tilence among men. Hence we ob&s;erve that men and cattle often peri&s;h with epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, when veget|ables fail to yield their cu&s;tomary fruits.</P>
<P>It is not however the <HI>want</HI> of food which occa&s;ions di&s;ea&s;es, &s;o frequently as the bad quality of it. Next to the corrupt &s;tate
<PB N="130" REF="036687_0485_100AA4809583C830">
of air, &s;ays Riverius, unwhole&s;ome aliments are the cau&s;es of pe&s;tilent di&s;ea&s;es. Vegetables may acquire unwhole&s;ome quali|ties from too much or too little moi&s;ture, or from other unknown cau&s;es. Grain of a good quality may al&s;o degenerate and be|come unwhole&s;ome, by heat and moi&s;ture, after it is gathered, as in magazines, granaries, or holds of &s;hips. Such corn may produce di&s;ea&s;es in tho&s;e who feed upon it.</P>
<P>But it is doubtful whether mere want of food ever produced a contagious di&s;ea&s;e. Seamen who &s;uffer and even peri&s;h at &s;ea, in a whole&s;ome air, thro mere hunger, pine away and die with|out di&s;ea&s;e. Whenever contagious di&s;tempers accompany dearth, there is u&s;ually a concurrence of other cau&s;es to produce the effect.</P>
<P>We may therefore con&s;ider the propo&s;ition of Diemerbroeck as correct, that famin does not produce the plague, but proceeds from the &s;ame cau&s;e; yet that &s;carcity of food and &s;till more certainly, food of a bad quality, may produce di&s;ea&s;es of a le&s;s malignant type, or very much augment, in violence and extent, the current di&s;orders of a particular &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Yet here again our &s;en&s;es may deceive us. Corn of an ap|parently bad quality, does not always generate di&s;ea&s;e. A &s;tri|king in&s;tance of this is related in Sinclair's Scotland, vol. 7. 605. Fro&s;t, rain and &s;now had turned the corn black; it was di&s;a|greeable to the ta&s;te; the &s;traw was equally affected; but nei|ther man nor bea&s;t &s;uffered by feeding on them&mdash;&s;o little do we know of the cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Intimately connected with the &s;ubject of vegetable nutriment, is the con&s;ideration of di&s;ea&s;es among cattle. Whenever gra&s;s is defective in whole&s;ome, nutritious qualities, hor&s;es, horn-cattle and &s;heep are &s;ure to &s;uffer by mortal di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>It is often mentioned in the foregoing pages, and a fact that every man may have ob&s;erved, that when contagious di&s;ea&s;es prevail among men, &s;imilar di&s;orders prevail more or le&s;s among cattle. Very few of the plagues in ancient Rome, affected one &s;pecies of animals, without &s;howing the pe&s;tilential principle in others. The &s;ame remark may be made, in all ages, and is true at the pre&s;ent period. Sometimes the pe&s;tilence invades one &s;pe|cies of animals fir&s;t&mdash;&s;ometimes another; &s;ometimes the di&s;ea&s;es
<PB N="131" REF="036687_0486_100AA4829C377320">
will be more general and &s;evere among men, and &s;ometimes among cattle; but &s;eldom do we ob&s;erve one &s;pecies of animals &s;everely affected, and the other totally exempt.</P>
<P>So far as my reading and ob&s;ervations enable me to judge, di&s;ea&s;es among cattle u&s;ually &s;ucceed exce&s;&s;ive or un&s;ea&s;onable humidity in the air. The years 1712 and 13, when a plague de&s;troyed a va&s;t proportion of the cattle in Italy, and great num|bers in Germany, are noted in England, to have been wet and cold. What was the &s;tate of the air in the countries where the di&s;ea&s;e was mo&s;t fatal, I am not informed. The &s;hort account I have &s;een of it, abridged from Ramazzini, in the 6th volume of Baddam's Memoirs, makes no mention of the weather or &s;ea&s;ons; and Lanci&s;ius, who has al&s;o left many particulars re|&s;pecting it, is not before me. The di&s;ea&s;e however was a true plague, characterized with many of the &s;ymptoms of plague in the human body. Authors all agree that the di&s;temper was prop|agated &s;olely by contagion from a &s;ingle cow, from Dalmatia; and they are &s;o well contented with this idea, that they tell us little or nothing from which we can collect the cau&s;e. Like the writers on the cau&s;e of the plague in Egypt, who trace it to Bar|bary or Syria, and there leave the &s;ubject; &s;o Lanci&s;ius and Ra|mazzini, tell us the di&s;temper, which de&s;troyed mo&s;t of the cattle in Italy, came from one cow, in a drove from Dalmatia; and there they &s;top &s;hort, without a &s;yllable to explain why the cow from Dalmatia was &s;eized.</P>
<P>All the&s;e contagion-&s;ticklers re&s;emble the Indian, who, when a&s;ked what the world &s;tands on, replied, on an elephant&mdash;the elephant, on a great turtle, and the turtle, on the ocean. Here he &s;topped, and as to what &s;upports the ocean, he leaves us in the dark.</P>
<P>The general vi&s;ible cau&s;e of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es among cattle, as before remarked, &s;eems to be an exce&s;s of moi&s;ture, which renders their food watery and un&s;ub&s;tantial. The &s;ummer of 1751, a year of remarkable mortality among the cattle in Eng|land, was cold and rainy. Such was the &s;ea&s;on in 1348, which was followed by a great lo&s;s of &s;heep, as well as by pe&s;tilence among men.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="036687_0487_100AA48533A63E88">Yet all wet &s;ea&s;ons do not produce the &s;ame effect; and we are con&s;trained to re&s;ort, for the cau&s;e, to un&s;een properties in the air or the food on which the cattle &s;ub&s;i&s;t.&mdash;That the &s;ame general cau&s;e affects cattle and the human race, in times of pe&s;ti|lence, is obvious from the analogy of &s;ymptoms in their di&s;ea&s;es. During the pre&s;ent &s;ickly period in America, hor&s;es and horned cattle have died, in many parts of the country, with di&s;ea&s;es which are characterized with bilious appearances; in analogy with all the di&s;orders which have affected men, during the &s;ame period.</P>
<P>Lanci&s;ius and Ramazzini would have treated the &s;ubject of the di&s;ea&s;e among hor&s;es and cattle in Italy, in 1712 and 13, much more like philo&s;ophers and men of &s;ound &s;cience, if, in&s;tead of telling how much mi&s;chief an infected cow had done, and how the di&s;ea&s;e had been &s;pread, by farriers, by dogs and by &s;hep|herds, they had de&s;cribed to us the &s;ea&s;ons, the &s;tate of vegeta|tion and the di&s;ea&s;es which prevailed among mankind. They ought at lea&s;t to have connected, with the di&s;ea&s;e among cattle, an exten&s;ive plague among men which was then raging in Vienna, Hungary, and other countries, as it had been, for &s;everal years before, over all the Poli&s;h and Baltic territories.</P>
<P>The frequent prevalence of mortal epidemics among the brutes, is an obvious and irre&s;i&s;tible proof of &s;ome deleterious principle in the elements, which is adequate to the production of the wor&s;t di&s;ea&s;es, and the de&s;truction of life, independent of every arti|ficial cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The brutes, if left to them&s;elves, follow implicitly, a princi|ple of their nature, called in&s;tinct. They eat what nature inten|ded for them, and never feed on what is pernicious to their health; nor will they injure them&s;elves by eating too much or too little of their ordinary food. Governed by &s;uch a law, they can be liable to no di&s;ea&s;es, but &s;uch as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily proceed from the air they breathe, the water they drink, or the vegetables they eat, all of which are ordinarily good, nutritious, and well fitted to &s;upport &s;ound health. Their di&s;ea&s;es therefore mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome imperfection in the&s;e elements of life, which is occa|&s;ioned by natural cau&s;es. This proce&s;s of rea&s;oning appears to
<PB N="133" REF="036687_0488_100AA48744C50608">
be &s;trictly logical and correct. The conclu&s;ions from it are inev|itable. If a &s;tate of the elements does ever exi&s;t, which can produce di&s;ea&s;es that de&s;troy the lives of the brutes, without con|tagion or any artificial cau&s;e, we may &s;afely allege that a &s;tate of the elements may exi&s;t in any latitude which is adequate to the production of the mo&s;t formidable maladies, that ever affect man|kind.</P>
<P>The analogies of the animal economy, and continual ob&s;er|vations forbid us to &s;uppo&s;e the powers of life in the bea&s;ts of the field, le&s;s perfect, or more ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved, than tho&s;e of the hu|man race. On the contrary, from their following their natural undepraved appetites, in the u&s;e of food and in all their actions, their bodies may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be more firm and perfect than tho&s;e of men, who are u&s;ually debilitated by irregularities in living, and other deviations from the laws of nature. If then irrational animals are &s;ubject to the inva&s;ions of mortal epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, which mow them down by thou&s;ands, in defiance of the firm texture of their bodies, and their regular living, a fortiori the human race mu&s;t be liable to de&s;truction by &s;imilar means.</P>
<P>This rea&s;oning is certainly ju&s;t and &s;ub&s;tantial, whatever may be its fate in convincing the reader; and it proves that the natu|ral operation of &s;ome &s;ecret principle in the elements, is &s;ufficient to account for the mo&s;t de&s;tructive maladies, in every latitude on the globe, without re&s;orting to the tran&s;portation of fomites from &s;ome one heaven-&s;courged country to more favored regions.</P>
<P>Dr. Mead and all his &s;ervile admirers who believe him, with|out inve&s;tigating his a&s;&s;ertions, allege that putrefaction never ri&s;es, in England, to a degree that is nece&s;&s;ary to generate a pe&s;tilence. But if any man can believe that putrefaction, as writers are plea&s;|ed to call the principle of de&s;truction, can ri&s;e high enough in the grades of malignity, to produce a plague or contagious mortal di&s;temper among cattle in England, and at the &s;ame time, never affect the human &s;pecies, he mu&s;t have more pride in the &s;uperem|inent &s;tation of man in the &s;cale of being, than I po&s;&s;e&s;s. The argument from facts is evidently in favor of the theory, which &s;ubjects all animals, in this re&s;pect, to the &s;ame laws; and the
<PB N="134" REF="036687_0489_100AA4894CC6C468">
analogies of creation will not authorize man to claim the high privilege of exemption from the general laws of the animal econ|omy. &mdash;It is an unque&s;tionable truth, that men as well as brutes, in all latitudes, are often invaded with contagious and deadly di&s;|ea&s;es, under the operation of the elements, without the lea&s;t ac|ce&s;&s;ion of contagion from &s;outhern climates or any foreign country. Multitudes of facts warrant this deduction; but the progre&s;&s;ion in the violence of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, the imperfection of vegeta|bles, the &s;ickne&s;s and death of fi&s;h in rivers and the ocean, and of cattle on land, are proofs of the truth of my principle, which bid defiance to oppo&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XVI. Of Contagion and Infection.</HEAD>
<P>NO point on the &s;ubject of di&s;ea&s;es has been more agitated among medical writers, than that of the contagion of the plague, inguinal and bilious.</P>
<P>Hippocrates has left no deci&s;ive opinion on this que&s;tion, but tho&s;e who maintain the plague not to be contagious, rely on this &s;ilence of the father of medicin, as an argument in their favor.</P>
<P>Galen's opinion was clearly in favor of the contagiou&s;ne&s;s of certain di&s;ea&s;es. "Quodque periculo&s;a &s;it conver&s;atio cum labo|rantibus pe&s;tilenti morboquum nimirum is non &s;ecus fit contagio|&s;us, quam &s;cabies aut lippitudo."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In another tran&s;lation, the latter part of this pa&s;&s;age &s;tands thus; "periculum enim e&s;t, ne concipiatur, ut &s;cabies et lippitudo."</NOTE> p. 379. The author doubt|le&s;s &s;peaks here of other pe&s;tilent di&s;ea&s;es, be&s;ides the inguinal plague, according to the practice of the ancients who gave the name of <HI>pe&s;tilence</HI> to other malignant di&s;tempers, when epidemic. His opinion however was that the plague originates in a putridity of the air, inhaled by the breath. "Lues ip&s;a, ab aeris putre|dine exorta, per in&s;pirationes in&s;iliens, haud unum aut alterum hominem, &s;ed plures quoque civitates depa&s;cit, va&s;tat, et popula|tur." p. 627. In another pa&s;&s;age, he remarks, that pe&s;tilent di&s;ea&s;es proceed from a &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere. "Pe&s;tilentes morbi a coeli &s;tatu pro&s;ici&s;cantur."</P>
<P>This author ob&s;erved that pe&s;tilential epidemics mu&s;t have &s;ome cau&s;e more powerful and exten&s;ive, than contagion, or infection.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle was clearly of opinion that the plague is contagious, and the rea&s;on he a&s;&s;igns why pe&s;tilence alone is communicated from per&s;on to per&s;on, is, that this is the only di&s;ea&s;e which is
<PB N="136" REF="036687_0491_100AA48DE3A00690">
common to all men. This is not very clear or &s;atisfactory; but he &s;peaks of fomites proceeding from the &s;ick, and infecting others.</P>
<BIBL>See Problem, &s;ect. 1.</BIBL>
<P>Procopius was not a phy&s;ician, but is e&s;teemed as a hi&s;torian. He alleges that in 543, the mortal plague in Con&s;tantinople was not contagious, and that phy&s;icians and attendants on the &s;ick, did not contract the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>On the other hand Thucydides, has declared unequivocally that the plague in Athens was very contagious. Evagrius al&s;o has related that the di&s;ea&s;e, in his time, was very contagious, to particular per&s;ons, while others e&s;caped, even again&s;t their in|clination. Livy al&s;o was decidedly in favor of the doctrin of contagion.</P>
<P>Petrus Salius Diver&s;us, cited by Diemerbroeck, was of the opinion, that the plague is &s;ometimes contagious; at other times, not. Seneca held to the contagious nature of pe&s;tilence. So &s;ays Ovid, Metamorph. 7.</P>

<P>The nearer we approach, and the more faithfully we &s;erve, the di&s;ea&s;ed, the &s;ooner we fall victims to the di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who oppo&s;e the doctrin of contagion, not only produce as authority, the &s;ilence of Hippocrates, with Avicenna, and other Arabian phy&s;icians, on the &s;ubject; but they allege, that if the plague was a contagious di&s;ea&s;e, it would <HI>always</HI> infect tho&s;e who have communication with the di&s;ea&s;ed. But this they aver to be contrary to fact; and they in&s;tance the e&s;cape of many phy&s;icians, &s;urgeons, grave-diggers, hear&s;e-men, and others. They argue further, that as the breath and effluvia of per&s;ons in health, will not expel the poi&s;on of the plague from the di&s;ea&s;ed; &s;o, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the other hand, the effluvia from the infected, cannot in|fu&s;e the &s;eeds of the di&s;order into a healthy body.</P>
<P>Gregory Ny&s;&s;en, a celebrated philo&s;opher and theologian, concludes, that tho&s;e who are &s;eized with the plague, after an intercour&s;e with the di&s;ea&s;ed, contract it from the &s;ame &s;tate of the air, which occa&s;ioned the di&s;temper in the &s;ick, and not from the effluvia exhaled from the infected body. While I cannot
<PB N="137" REF="036687_0492_100AA48F69337C40">
a&s;&s;ent to this opinion, in the utmo&s;t latitude, I firmly believe it contains a great deal of truth.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck, de pe&s;te p. 44, &s;ugge&s;ts that the ancient phy|&s;icians, who pa&s;&s;ed over the &s;ubject of the contagion of the plague, called that quality only <HI>contagion,</HI> which communicates di&s;ea&s;e by immediate contact, as in ca&s;e of the itch, lepro&s;y, hy|drophobia and the like; whereas the plague infects more fre|quently through the medium of the air, vapors, garments and other objects. Thus the &s;weat, exhalations, and excrementi|tious matter of the &s;ick corrupt the air, and this infected air be|comes the means of di&s;ea&s;e to per&s;ons in health who breathe it. This, &s;ays Diemerbroeck, the ancients did not call contagion, proceeding from the di&s;ea&s;ed, but they con&s;idered healthy per|&s;ons taking the di&s;temper through this medium, as infected by the malignity of the air.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all modern phy&s;icians however agree in the opinion that the plague is a contagious di&s;ea&s;e, as Fore&s;tus, Pro&s;per Al|pinus, Diemerbroeck, Sydenham, and a multitude of others; and on this general opinion, have been in&s;tituted quarantine laws and other regulations for pre&s;erving cities and countries from the di&s;ea&s;e. Of the value of the&s;e regulations, we &s;hall be the bet|ter able to judge, after taking a careful &s;urvey of the que&s;tion relative to the force and effects of contagion.</P>
<P>Within a few years, one author has ventured again to call in que&s;tion the received opinions on this &s;ubject. Dr. Maclean, in a &s;mall treati&s;e, has attempted to prove that the plague, dy&s;en|tery and epidemic fevers are never propagated by contagion. Contagion he defines to be "a &s;pecific matter generated in a per&s;on affected with di&s;ea&s;e, and capable of communicating that particular di&s;ea&s;e, with or without contact, to another."</P>
<P>This author's general arguments are the&s;e, That &s;pecific con|tagion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily act and communicate a di&s;ea&s;e from a &s;ick to a well per&s;on, within a certain di&s;tance&mdash;that in the plague, dy&s;entery and epidemic fevers, a &s;mall proportion of people, expo&s;ed to the action of effluvia from the di&s;ea&s;ed, are ever af|fected by the di&s;tempers, and therefore &s;uch di&s;orders are not contagious. He con&s;iders tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es only as contagious,
<PB N="138" REF="036687_0493_100AA491720BD808">
which can be received but once by the &s;ame per&s;on; as the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les. He affirms that the exi&s;tence of contagion in plague, dy&s;entery and fevers, has been uniformly taken for granted, not only without proof, but even contrary to the evi|dence of numerous and convincing facts. He lays it down as a truth, that all epidemic and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, which may af|fect a per&s;on more than once in his life, are cau&s;ed by certain &s;tates or vici&s;&s;itudes of the atmo&s;phere, producing indirect de|bility.</P>
<P>The variety of opinions on this &s;ubject argues either a want of accurate ob&s;ervations among medical men, or of accurate di&s;|tinctions in terms. The various powers of di&s;ea&s;es to commu|nicate them&s;elves, either have not been under&s;tood, or they have been imperfectly defined. Let us then attend to facts, the only genuin &s;ource of knowledge.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. We ob&s;erve that the contagion of the mea&s;les and &s;mall-pox, takes effect with great certainty, whenever a per&s;on in health, who has never been affected, approaches &s;ufficiently near to a di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on. I do not &s;ay it <HI>always</HI> takes effect; for there are a few exceptions; but the&s;e are &s;o rare, as not to impeach the generality of the fact, or principle.</P>
<P>The contagion of the plague, dy&s;entery and violent fevers, does not, under circum&s;tances equally favorable, take effect with the like certainty. On the contrary, a great proportion of per|&s;ons expo&s;ed to the effluvia of the &s;ick, entirely e&s;cape the di&s;|tempers.</P>
<P>Secondly. The contagion of &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les, is not &s;en&s;ibly affected in its operation by heat or cold, moi&s;ture or drouth. It acts with the &s;ame certainty in winter as in &s;ummer, and in every variety of temperature.</P>
<P>The contagion of plague, dy&s;entery and typhus fevers, on the other hand, depends almo&s;t entirely on heat for its activity, and is &s;ubdued, rendered inert, or totally extingui&s;hed by cold. Hence an e&s;&s;ential difference in the two &s;pecies of contagion&mdash; that of the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les being an e&s;&s;ential quality of the di&s;ea&s;es; while that of the other di&s;ea&s;es is an accidental cir|cum&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="036687_0494_100AA49332906D70">Thirdly. The contagion of the plague often di&s;criminates between the natives of particular countries, or men of a partic|ular blood, or family, &s;eizing one and pa&s;&s;ing by another, and this through the whole cour&s;e of an epidemic; but the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les make no &s;uch di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>Fourthly. The contagion of the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les is not de&s;troyed by the purity of the atmo&s;phere; it acts with the &s;ame certainty on the mo&s;t &s;alubrious hills, as in the mo&s;t impure re|ce&s;&s;es of poverty.</P>
<P>Not &s;o the contagion of the plague, and dy&s;entery; for as a general rule, the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are not propagated in a pure atmo&s;|phere. With re&s;pect to the plague, &s;ome e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ceptions exi&s;t; but it is the u&s;ual fact, that the&s;e la&s;t named di&s;ea&s;es will not &s;pread by contagion in a whole&s;ome &s;tate of the air. By removing the &s;ick, from a city into the country, or otherways placing him in an airy room, and pre&s;erving it clean, with all the apparel and uten&s;ils, the contagion is &s;o di&s;&s;ipated or attenuated, as to be ren|dered harmle&s;s; the attendants e&s;cape, and the di&s;ea&s;e is extin|gui&s;hed with the death or recovery of the patient.</P>
<P>Fifthly. The contagion of the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les can never act but once on the &s;ame per&s;on. Its fir&s;t operation de|&s;troys the capacity of receiving it a &s;econd time. The excep|tions to this rule are too few to de&s;erve con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Totally different is the effect of the plague and dy&s;entery, for in&s;tead of fortifying the body again&s;t a &s;econd attack, the&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es debilitate the animal powers, and render the patient more &s;u&s;ceptible of the contagion in a &s;ub&s;equent year. It is admitted by all correct ob&s;ervers, that the plague may be received by the &s;ame per&s;on, times without limits; a per&s;on in Con&s;tantinople died of the twelfth attack; and many per&s;ons, in the late plagues in America, have been affected two or three times. With re|&s;pect to dy&s;entery and other contagious fevers, there is no con|trover&s;y on this point.</P>
<P>Sixthly. The contagion of the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les, if it takes the lea&s;t effect, produces the di&s;ea&s;e complete. The in|fected patient may be affected more lightly than the infecting per&s;on, and the degrees of violence in the &s;ymptoms may be very
<PB N="140" REF="036687_0495_100AA497DC953708">
vatious; but the di&s;ea&s;e produced, will always be completely formed, and of the &s;ame &s;pecific type, as that from which it is communicated.</P>
<P>The contagion of the plague and dy&s;entery, has not the &s;ame certainty in its effect. The contagion of the plague very often produces only a nau&s;ea and vomiting&mdash;&s;ometimes an inferior grade of fever, as an intermitting or remitting fever, of which I have my&s;elf &s;een examples&mdash;very often its effects are limited to dizzi|ne&s;s in the head, or &s;evere pains in the glands&mdash;and &s;ometimes it has produced external eruptions, without any other material affection; as in the celebrated Diemerbroeck, who, in the grievous plague at Nimeguen, was affected with a carbuncle on his left hand, while in good health. In 1796, I &s;aw an in|&s;tance in New-York, in which the infection of the pe&s;tilential fever had occa&s;ioned a &s;ingular &s;welling and inflammation in the face of a nur&s;e, who e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Seventhly. We may perhaps add, what Diemerbroeck and other writers con&s;ider as e&s;&s;ential to give effect to the contagion of the plague, and dy&s;entery, an apt or &s;uitable di&s;po&s;ition in the &s;ound body to receive the contagion. Some peculiar &s;tate of a body in health is evidently nece&s;&s;ary to the operation of the infecting principle of the plague; this is agreed by all authors. But it does not appear that any &s;uch &s;tate or di&s;po&s;ition is requi|&s;ite to give effect to the contagion of &s;mall-pox or mea&s;les, which acts upon all bodies, within the reach of their effluvia. This con|&s;ideration may be the cau&s;e of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction before recited; and a few exceptions exi&s;t to the propo&s;ition in regard to the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les, which, tho rarely, fail of operating on bodies in health.</P>
<P>The&s;e are important di&s;tinctions, which, had they been ob|&s;erved by medical writers, would have prevented the enormous errors of Mead and others, who maintain that the plague is prop|agated, in northern countries, by &s;pecific contagion only. The truth is, the plague is a contagious di&s;ea&s;e, like dy&s;entery, and mo&s;t typhus fevers, but the contagion is <HI>not &s;pecific.</HI></P>
<P>Specific contagion I define to be, a quality of a di&s;ea&s;e, which, within a &s;uitable di&s;tance, communicates it from a body affected
<PB N="141" REF="036687_0496_100AA49546C9D6B8">
with it, to a &s;ound body, with great certainty, and under all circum&s;tances of &s;ea&s;on, weather or &s;ituation. Such is the con|tagion of the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les. This contagion is of two kinds; fir&s;t, that which acts by contact only, as that of the itch, lepro&s;y, hydrophobia and &s;iphilis; &s;econdly, that which produ|ces its effect, with equal certainty, by near approach, as that of &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les. The contagion of the angina maligna approaches to the &s;pecific kind; and if it is true, as &s;ome modern phy&s;icians have a&s;&s;erted, that per&s;ons can never be affected with it, more than once, it comes under the character of a <HI>&s;pecific</HI> contagion, but I doubt the fact. Several per&s;ons in Bethlem, were affected with the &s;carlatina angino&s;a twice, during the late epidemic; fir&s;t in 1793 and again in 1794.</P>
<BIBL>Medical Repo&s;itory, vol. 1. 525.</BIBL>
<P>That quality of a di&s;ea&s;e which may or may not excite it in a &s;ound body, within a &s;uitable di&s;tance, or by contact; and which depends on heat, foul air, an apt di&s;po&s;ition in the re|ceiving body, or other contingent circum&s;tances, and which may excite the di&s;ea&s;e in the &s;ame per&s;on more than once, is certainly a very di&s;tinct &s;pecies of contagion, from that of the &s;mall-pox, and to this I give the denomination of <HI>infection.</HI></P>
<P>With a di&s;tinction of this &s;ort, which &s;eems to have been fir&s;t adopted by an eminent phy&s;ician in New-York, Dr. Bailey, in his treati&s;e on the fever of 1795 page 38, and which is unque&s;|tionably well founded, we have no difficulty in explaining all the phenomena of contagion, which have given ri&s;e to di&s;putes, with|out number and to the mo&s;t contradictory opinions. The plague, glandular and bilious, the dy&s;entery, typhus fevers, and the milder kinds of angina, are not <HI>&s;pecifically contagious,</HI> but they are <HI>infectious.</HI> They will not and do not propagate them&s;elves in all &s;ituations, but the operation of the infecting quality is con|trolled by a multitude of contingent circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. It is admitted on all hands, that a &s;uitable and partic|ular con&s;titution of air, is nece&s;&s;ary to render the plague epidem|ic in northern latitudes. Thus Sydenham &s;uppo&s;es this di&s;ea&s;e to be conveyed by pe&s;tilential particles from one place to another, but not to become epidemic, unle&s;s favored by the con&s;titution of
<PB N="142" REF="036687_0497_100AA49964987820">
air. One ground of his opinion &s;eems to have been a fact rela|ted by Mead, that when the di&s;ea&s;e has raged violently in one town, in the &s;ame climate, a neighboring town has totally e&s;ca|ped, by forbiding intercour&s;e with the infected place, as once happened in Tu&s;cany.&mdash;This fact will be afterwards con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Mead al&s;o, while he declares his opinion that the plague is &s;pread by &s;pecific contagion only, like &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les, and that all plagues are to be traced to Egypt, very incon&s;i&s;tently ad|mits that a certain corruption of the air is nece&s;&s;ary to give the contagious atoms their full force.</P>
<P>The&s;e opinions are utterly incongruous; for if the plague po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es &s;pecific contagion, like the &s;mall-pox, then a corrupt &s;tate of air is <HI>not</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to give full force to the contagion; for no &s;uch &s;tate of air is requi&s;ite to give force to the contagion of the &s;mall-pox. It &s;preads with as much certainty in pure air, as in foul air. Mead's principles therefore overthrow his own theory. But he was driven to admit &s;ome general con&s;titution of air, to be nece&s;&s;ary to the propagation of the plague, becau&s;e he had learnt from reading that the plague will not &s;pread in all places, at all times and under all circum&s;tances. In truth, Mead never had an idea of the difference between the &s;pecies of contagion; and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of mo&s;t modern writers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is a mo&s;t extraordinary circum&s;tance that the Briti&s;h authors, in modern days, &s;hould all agree that a favorable con&s;titution of air is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to propagate the plague, and yet that no plague is bred in north|ern climates. They mu&s;t admit and do admit, that &s;uch a favorable &s;tate of air has often exi&s;ted in all parts of Europe; this is a kind of half way bu&s;ine&s;s; allowing northern climates the power of creating and preparing a condition of atmo&s;phere that &s;hall meet the plague half-way.</P>
<P>But will it be denied that the petechial fever and angina maligna originate in northern latitudes? I pre&s;ume not. Then the condition of air is admitted to produce <HI>mo&s;t deadly infectious</HI> di&s;ea&s;es, but not <HI>the mo&s;t deadly of all.</HI> Kind heaven, in mercy to the northern world, has permitted the elements to generate di&s;ea&s;es almo&s;t as bad as the plague, but not quite.</P>
<P>I then a&s;k, does not the production of the angina maligna &s;uppo&s;e as deleterious a principle in the air, as that of the plague? Is not the di&s;ea&s;e as fatal to youth, and more certainly infectious or contagious? This cannot be denied. That di&s;ea&s;e &s;ometimes de&s;troys as great a pro|portion of patients &s;eized as the plague, and is more certainly conta|gious to youth? Be&s;ides this di&s;temper depends not on local cau&s;es, but wholly on a condition of the elements; it therefore implies a mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial alteration in the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Further, if petechial fever is generated in northern climates, it de|mon&s;trates the power of tho&s;e climates to produce the plague; for it has been proved, that this fever is the &s;ame &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e, and of|tens turns to the plague. It has done this, very often in England and on the Baltic.</P>
<P>Infection &s;preads certain di&s;ea&s;es, and ought to be avoided; but med|ical men have a&s;cribed ten times more effects to that cau&s;e, than it ever produced. The &s;ame principle which generates the angina maligna or plague, in one in&s;tance, mu&s;t be competent to produce it in all other per&s;ons of like di&s;po&s;ition and habits.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="036687_0498_100AA49BE2337A58">Sanctorious, cited by Van Swieten, remarked that the rays of the plague may be removed by the wind, yet he was &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve that the&s;e rays from the body of a di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on, are never di&s;turbed by the force of the air. I do not perfectly reconcile the&s;e remarks; but it is an indubitable fact, that a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air, when clearly and di&s;tinctly formed in a city, is not di&s;&s;ipa|ted, nor very greatly affected by the mo&s;t violent winds. It has &s;ometimes been remarked, that the pe&s;tilential fever in American cities, has been &s;pread by particular winds; but it has &s;pread not only before, but again&s;t the wind, tho perhaps with le&s;s rapidity. Certain it is, that no force of wind whatever ever expels from a town, or le&s;&s;ens the pe&s;tilential virus without the aid of other cau&s;es. Of this we have had repeated proofs in America.</P>
<P>Perhaps we may explain this fact, and reconcile the ob&s;erva|tions of Sanctorius, on the principle I have unfolded; by &s;up|po&s;ing the effluvia of the &s;ick to be, in &s;ome degree, capable of di&s;&s;ipation by the wind, which is undoubtedly true; but that the elemental cau&s;e of pe&s;tilence, which con&s;i&s;ts in the e&s;&s;ential prop|erties of the atmo&s;phere, is not &s;ubject to di&s;per&s;ion or removal by the winds. This con&s;ideration would involve a curious que&s;|tion, viz. whether, in the apparent motion of air, called wind, the whole ma&s;s of the &s;urrounding atmo&s;phere is moved, or whether it is the vapor, or other component parts of the air only, which are moved, while the fire or electric fluid remains &s;tation|ary. But whatever may be the cau&s;e, the fact is certain, that the pe&s;tilential principle, during a plague in a city or town, is never expelled by winds. A mo&s;t violent, cool north-we&s;t wind &s;wept the city of New-York, on the 19th and 20th of September 1795, without any con&s;iderable abatement of the pe&s;tilential fever. This fact adds no &s;mall weight to my opinion, that the primary cau&s;e
<PB N="144" REF="036687_0499_100AA49EA50F2308">
of &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es, is in the e&s;&s;ential combination of the component parts of the atmo&s;phere.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Warm &s;outherly rains however high the wind, u&s;ually increa&s;e the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e, by inducing debility and giving activity to the local cau&s;es, as noxious effluvia from vegetable &s;ub&s;tances. Cool north|erly winds, <HI>accompanied with heavy rains,</HI> le&s;&s;en the morbid action of the pe&s;tilential principle; and if late in the &s;ea&s;on, and not &s;ucceeded by very warm weather, may entirely remove it. A violent tornado, with great rain, on the 8th of October 1797, was &s;uppo&s;ed to put a &s;tep to the pe&s;tilential fever in Providence.

<P>Sanctorius further ob&s;erves that "things infected with the plague, communicate the di&s;ea&s;e, as long as the proximate and remote cau&s;es &s;ub&s;i&s;t; one of which cea&s;ing, the infection cea&s;es." This is an explicit acknowledgment that the contagion is not <HI>&s;pecific,</HI> but dependent on &s;ome other cau&s;e, agreeable to the doctrin of Sydenham.</P>
<P>This principle is verified mo&s;t remarkably in Egypt, as appears by all the authors who have written on the &s;ubject. They are all con&s;trained to admit, even when they allege the plague to be not native in that country, that, if imported at certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year, it will not &s;pread. Pro&s;per Alpinus expre&s;sly de|clares that the plague is <HI>never imported in the months of June, July and Augu&s;t;</HI> "nunquam vi&s;a e&s;t pe&s;tis illuc ex infectis lo|cis profecta;" altho he maintains that the di&s;ea&s;e is almo&s;t al|ways imported.</P>
<P>This is certainly a mo&s;t extraordinary a&s;&s;ertion, and unworthy of the reputation of the writer. What in the name of &s;en&s;e and con&s;i&s;tency, &s;hould prevent the &s;eeds of &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e from be|ing "imported" in a particular &s;ea&s;on, when ve&s;&s;els are pa&s;&s;ing continually between that country and infected places? The idea betrays extreme weakne&s;s or prejudice.</P>
<P>Savary in his letters on Egypt has detailed the true &s;tate of facts. He &s;aw ve&s;&s;els, which arrived in Egypt from Turkey, in the month of Augu&s;t, and landed their infected goods and peo|ple, without communicating the di&s;ea&s;e. He informs us, that it is an ob&s;ervation of ages, that infected merchandize brot into Egypt, in the months of June, July and Augu&s;t, do not excite the plague, but the di&s;ea&s;e expires of it&s;elf. If introduced at

other &s;ea&s;ons, and communicated, it cea&s;es; but if imported in winter, it &s;preads.</P>
<P>The author has here &s;tated effects or phenomena, with a good degree of accuracy; but has entirely mi&s;taken the cau&s;e. It is wholly the &s;tate of air, in different &s;ea&s;ons, and not infection, which occa&s;ions the&s;e varieties.</P>
<P>Mackenzie, in an account of the plague in Con&s;tantinople, tho a firm believer in its contagion, declares "that b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th in that city and in Smyrna, the plague breaks out in &s;ome years, when it is not po&s;&s;ible to trace whence it is conveyed." This is doubtle&s;s true; yet neither this fact, nor the known fact that contagion in Egypt will not operate in a certain &s;ea&s;on of the year, has ever opened the eyes of European authors to the ab|&s;urdity of the current notions about the &s;pecific contagion of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>A fact related by Patrick Ru&s;&s;el, in his hi&s;tory of the plague at Aleppo in 1760, is full to the &s;ame point, that the contagion of the plague, will not take effect, without the aid of other cau&s;es. In 1759, the di&s;ea&s;e was introduced into Lein&s;ol, a port on the &s;outh &s;ide of Cyprus, where it &s;pread. Larnica, a town forty miles di&s;tant, received part of the infected crew, which brot the contagion to Lein&s;ol. A con&s;tant communica|tion was held between the two cities; pea&s;ants and mule drivers entered Larnica, with their pe&s;tilential &s;ores upon them, and were daily in the &s;treets and markets. Some died in the hou&s;es of the inhabitants. Other ve&s;&s;els al&s;o arrived with infected crews from Egypt, &s;ome of whom died on landing. Yet mark the i&s;&s;ue&mdash;all this contagion did not excite the plague in Larnica! But in the beginning of the next year, eight months after, the di&s;ea&s;e appeared in Larnica, without contagion, and made great havoc. See Ru&s;&s;el, page 4.</P>
<P>This fact and others compelled the author to admit that the di&s;ea&s;e is not always contagious, and that it does not become epi|demic, without a certain &s;tate of air. See pages 4, 5, 7, 17, 19, 307. The&s;e facts are of infinite con&s;equence in directing the application of laws of quarantine; a &s;ubject to be hereafter di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="036687_0501_100AA4A0B56E9E90">Innumerable examples may be produced of plague, appearing in a few detached ca&s;es, without becoming epidemic and with|out extending it&s;elf by contagion beyond a &s;ingle family.

<P>Pollinus relates an in&s;tance of a family, in which the father, mother, with two children and a &s;ervant died of the plague, without glandular &s;wellings, and without &s;preading the di&s;ea&s;e be|yond that family.</P>
<P>Joubert informs us of an in&s;tance in 1574, of a re&s;pectable family, which lo&s;t half of its members, by the plague, which cea&s;ed without &s;preading the infection. This was at the com|mencement of a mo&s;t pe&s;tilential period.</P>
<P>Matthias Untzerus relates, that at Halle in Saxony, he was an eye-witne&s;s of in&s;tances, in which here and there a family had been &s;eized with the plague, introduced from other places, without any ill effects in the re&s;t of the city&mdash;the di&s;ea&s;e termi|nating in the&s;e families.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck ob&s;erved &s;imilar facts. In Oct. 1661, the daughter of a noble widow, was &s;eized with a violent di&s;ea&s;e re|&s;embling the plague, in the mid&s;t of a town where no plague <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;t|ed, and no foreign cau&s;e could be a&s;&s;igned for the di&s;ea&s;e. The &s;er|vant, who attended her, died, and the infection extended to &s;even per&s;ons, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; the re&s;t &s;aved them&s;elves by flight. The&s;e per&s;ons died, without the glandular tumors, and of cour&s;e &s;ome of the attending phy&s;icians, denied the di&s;ea&s;e to be the plague. Diemerbroeck, on the contrary, judging from all the &s;ymptoms, pronounced it the plague. It happened that one of the maid-&s;ervants, who left the family and was going to her brother's at Am&s;terdam, was infected and &s;eized with the plague, which &s;oon put on the genuin marks of the di&s;ea&s;e, in an inguinal tumor and two anthraces. She recovered, but infected two of her broth|er's children, and there the di&s;ea&s;e di&s;appeared. No local cau&s;e could be a&s;&s;igned for the di&s;ea&s;e in that family. The plague was not before in the city or country, the hou&s;e was a &s;plendid, ele|gant one and kept remarkably clean, remote from any filthy place, and had never been known to have an infected per&s;on in it. Hence our author concludes very ju&s;tly that a pe&s;tilent di&s;|ea&s;e
<PB N="147" REF="036687_0502_100AA4A2403AA3B8">
is not always epidemic, nor is an epidemic always danger|ous, nor is pe&s;tilence nece&s;&s;arily common to many people; but that the &s;preading of a di&s;ea&s;e by contagion, is wholly an acci|dental circum&s;tance.</P>

<P>On this la&s;t fact, I will only ob&s;erve, that the year it hap|pened, was 1661, the beginning of the con&s;titution which pro|duced the augmented violence of the di&s;ea&s;es of London, as re|lated by Sydenham, and the con&s;titution which occa&s;ioned the plague in Holland in 1663 and 4, and that in London in 1665.</P>
<P>It is to be regretted that tho&s;e able phy&s;icians and accurate ob|&s;ervers had not extended their views of the &s;ubject to a preval|ence of that pe&s;tilential con&s;titution, in various countries, at one and the &s;ame time, in&s;tead of re&s;tricting their ob&s;ervations, each to his own country.</P>
<P>The author of the Trait&eacute; de la pe&s;te, who was a warm &s;tick|ier for the origin of the plague at Mar&s;eilles in 1720 from im|portation, and wrote a treati&s;e to prove it, has however demon|&s;trated the contrary. He has admitted that the air of Mar&s;eilles was pe&s;tilential and produced di&s;ea&s;es marked with buboes and carbuncles, in the autumn preceding its &s;uppo&s;ed importation. But this is not all; he has recorded facts which confirm all that has been cited from Alpinus, Savary, Ru&s;&s;el and others, that the contagion of the plague will not &s;pread the di&s;ea&s;e in an atmo&s;|phere not favorable to its propagation. He informs us, that the di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread from Mar&s;eilles, in &s;pite of all precautions, and infected more than fifty villages of Provence. This was a&s;cribed to infected goods conveyed from Mar&s;eilles. Yet the &s;urround|ing provinces of Languedoc, Velais, Dauphin&eacute; and others, which he acknowledges to have been inundated with goods from the &s;ame city, e&s;caped all infection. In Provence, the di&s;tem|per reached the inhabitants of mountains and was not even ar|re&s;ted by the rigors of winter; while in the adjoining territories, no per&s;on was affected, tho equally expo&s;ed to infection. The author remarks further, that the di&s;ea&s;e pa&s;&s;ed over &s;ome villages, and infected others beyond them; for which no rea&s;on could be a&s;&s;igned, while all were alike expo&s;ed.</P>

<P>Almo&s;t all the &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;tances of infection from merchan|dize, related in authors, when inve&s;tigated, are found to be mere &s;uppo&s;itions and conjectures, rai&s;ed and &s;pread by vulgar credulity, without the lea&s;t foundation, and afterwards recorded as facts, by medical writers, who are infinitely le&s;s excu&s;able, than other people. I have inve&s;tigated many &s;uch in&s;tances in America, where reports had become popular, and grown into &s;uch credit, as to be generally believed and received as facts, and I have, in every ca&s;e, found evidence amounting to demon|&s;tration, that tho&s;e reports were idle &s;urmi&s;es, very often puerile in their origin, and utterly un&s;upported by facts. Some of the received opinions, in regard to the imported infection of plagues in Europe, when &s;ubjected to careful &s;crutiny, prove to be equal|ly de&s;titute of foundation. Among the&s;e, are the opinions, re|ceived and recorded by grave writers, relative to the London plague of 1665, and that at Mar&s;eilles in 1720.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ition that the plague was conveyed from Mar&s;eilles into fifty villages of Provence, by means of merchandize, ap|pears to be no better founded. Setting a&s;ide the errors of vul|gar tales, in which &s;uch opinions u&s;ually originate, it is utterly again&s;t all probability that goods &s;old from &s;hops and warehou&s;es &s;hould contain infection. If they are ever infected, it mu&s;t be by being u&s;ed by the &s;ick; but the &s;ick do not u&s;e the goods in &s;hops and &s;tores; they are confined to their rooms; and rarely indeed are their bedding and clothes, &s;ent to market. Goods, the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of infection, as woollen and cotton, may lie in &s;tore during the plague, without any taint that can excite di&s;ea&s;e. In America we know this to be fact. In every town, where the fever has prevailed, &s;hops and warehou&s;es filled with &s;uch &s;orts of goods, are open long after the di&s;ea&s;e has appear|ed, and until the air of the &s;treets has become &s;o pe&s;tilential, as to excite the di&s;ea&s;e in a few hours in healthy &s;trangers; nay,

&s;ome of the&s;e &s;hops are open, during the whole time, of the rage o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r wor&s;t plagues; yet even cotton and woollen cloths have never, in any in&s;tance, contracted infection &s;o as to com|municate the di&s;ea&s;e afterwards to tho&s;e who handled or u&s;ed them. I will venture to aver that all the reports in Europe about the propagation of the plague from town to town, and country to country, by merchandize, are the offspring of vulgar tales. It is po&s;&s;ible that garments <HI>worn by the &s;ick</HI> and <HI>not clean&s;ed,</HI> may excite the di&s;ea&s;e in a &s;ound body; but &s;uch garments, to re|tain the infection, mu&s;t be clo&s;ely packed in bales, che&s;ts or boxes, or the action of the air will de&s;troy the infection, in a few days. And whenever an in&s;tance of this kind happens, the di&s;ea&s;e will die with the patient fir&s;t infected; it will rarely or never &s;pread, unle&s;s the con&s;titution of air is &s;o pe&s;tilential, as to produce the di&s;ea&s;e without infection.</P>
<P>In the&s;e po&s;itions, I am warranted by a multitude of facts related of European plagues, and many that have occurred in America.</P>
<P>Hence, goods tran&s;ported from Mar&s;eilles, during the plague, did <HI>not</HI> communicate the di&s;ea&s;e in Languedoc, Velais or Dau|phin&eacute;. The true rea&s;on of the facts related by Chicoyneau, is, that the air of the whole country about Mar&s;eilles was pe&s;tilen|tial, and affected mo&s;t of the villages in Provence, altho &s;ome e&s;caped. Further removed from the &s;ea &s;hore, in the contigu|ous provinces, the air was le&s;s pe&s;tilential, and the di&s;ea&s;e did not appear. Goods were conveyed to all the&s;e provinces indi&s;|criminately; but they had no concern in the propagation of the plague. The plague appeared, where the pe&s;tilential principle was competent to produce it, the &s;eat of which was at Mar&s;eilles, a large populous city; but which extended, as it always does, to &s;ome di&s;tance, beyond which it produced no plague. Wherever the di&s;temper appeared, vulgar ignorance a&s;cribed it to goods; and where it did not appear, after the reception of goods from Mar|&s;eilles, the vulgar and the learned all agree they could not ac|count for it; they wondered that goods would not infect people in Languedoc, as well as in Provence&mdash;and all the writers on the &s;ubject in Europe, from that time to this, &s;eemed to have been &s;atisfied with wondering at the phenomenon.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="036687_0505_100AA4A9047A7C00">Of the truth of the doctrin, that the plague will not &s;pread from infection, in an atmo&s;phere not proper for it, we have in America mo&s;t indubitable evidences.</P>
<P>In every pe&s;tilence that has affected our cities for &s;ix years pa&s;t, great numbers of per&s;ons, when ill, have been removed into the country, or have been &s;eized after removal, but not one in|&s;tance occurred of the &s;preading of the di&s;ea&s;e in the country to any extent, from &s;uch infected per&s;ons until the year 1798. There have been a few &s;cattering in&s;tances, in which the nur&s;es of &s;uch per&s;ons have received the di&s;order. The&s;e have been very rare; probably not in one in&s;tance of a hundred, has any per&s;on been affected by fomites from &s;uch di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons. Mo&s;t violent ca&s;es of the pe&s;tilence, when removed into a pure air, exhibit no infection that is perceptible. This fact corre&s;ponds with what has been related of the importation of infected per|&s;ons and goods into Egypt in June, July and Augu&s;t, which pro|duces no ill effect; but for a very good rea&s;on; the air of that country, during the inundation of the Nile, will not <HI>generate</HI> the plague; and hence the vulgar idea, that it is not imported, or will not &s;pread from infection.</P>
<P>But not only do our country people e&s;cape infection, from di&s;|ea&s;ed citizens who &s;icken and die in their hou&s;es, but our cities al&s;o, when the con&s;titution of air does not favor the di&s;ea&s;e, are not affected by the introduction of the wor&s;t ca&s;es from neigh|boring cities. Thus in 1793, many per&s;ons from Philadelphia, entered New-York, in &s;pite of precautions, taken by the police, &s;ickened and died in boarding hou&s;es and other places, but with|out communicating the di&s;ea&s;e in a &s;ingle in&s;tance. In 1795, the ca&s;e was rever&s;ed; New-York generated a contagious fever, but Philadelphia did not; and &s;everal per&s;ons, who left New-York, &s;ickened and died in Philadelphia without infecting any per&s;on whatever.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to multiply examples; the &s;ame has happen|ed between Philadelphia and Baltimore; between Norfolk and the adjacent country; between Bo&s;ton and Providence; in &s;hort there is not an exception to the remark, that infected per&s;ons, carried into towns and cities where the atmo&s;phere has not been

di&s;po&s;ed to <HI>generate</HI> an epidemic, have never propagated the di&s;|ea&s;e. In every ca&s;e, and the in&s;tances have been very numerous, the di&s;ea&s;e has di&s;appeared with the recovery or death of the fir&s;t or &s;econd patient.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1798 the fir&s;t ca&s;es of the fever in Che&s;ter and Wilmington origin|ated from Philadelphia; but the atmo&s;phere al&s;o of the country in New-Jer&s;ey and Delaware actually <HI>generated</HI> the di&s;ea&s;e, in the neighboring di&s;tricts, and &s;o it did in Connecticut.</NOTE></P>
<P>But this is not all. In the &s;ame town or city, where the pe&s;ti|lence has been general in a particular quarter, another part of the town or city, &s;ituated on better ventilated or more elevated land, has not only been free from the epidemic, but has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an air capable of re&s;i&s;ting the infection of the di&s;ea&s;ed. This, to a cer|tain degree, was the fact in Philadelphia, where no part of the city can be called <HI>elevated;</HI> yet in 1793 and 1797, few ca&s;es of the fever occurred in the we&s;tern part of the city. But in New-York, New-Haven, Providence, New-London, Bo&s;ton, and Newburyport, the di&s;ea&s;e has had its pe&s;tilential region, or quarter of the town, in which it became epidemic and infectious; but other parts of the town have been free from it. And in all &s;uch in&s;tances the mo&s;t malignant ca&s;es, in per&s;ons &s;eized in the pe&s;tilential region, and conveyed to the healthy part of the town, have exhibited no infection; or if a &s;ingle nur&s;e has taken the di&s;ea&s;e, of which I have heard of two or three in&s;tances, the infection has there cea&s;ed and produced no further effects.</P>
<P>The&s;e exempted parts of the towns are the more cleanly and airy &s;ituations. To this however occur two exceptions. One in Philadelphia, in 1798, the di&s;ea&s;e of which year was more virulent and more infectious, than in former years, and extended to healthy po&s;itions. The other exception is in New-London, the la&s;t &s;ummer al&s;o; in which town, the di&s;ea&s;e had indeed its pe&s;tilential region, marked di&s;tinctly, as before related; but this part of the town, where the di&s;ea&s;e raged, is as airy and well built, as any other quarter.</P>
<P>Evagrius remarked of the plague in his time, that it &s;ome|times attacked certain parts of cities, and left others untouched. See the year 590.</P>
<P>Pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es then have an atmo&s;phere in which they
<PB N="152" REF="036687_0507_100AA4ACA0262210">
rage with violence; but at a di&s;tance, they lo&s;e the power of in|fecting, at lea&s;t to a great degree. Van Swieten remarks this of the &s;potted fever in 1756&mdash;if healthy per&s;ons de&s;cended into the valleys where it was prevalent, they took the di&s;ea&s;e; but when removed into more airy &s;ituations, they infected no one.</P>
<BIBL>Vol. 16. 59.</BIBL>
<P>The&s;e facts all concur to e&s;tabli&s;h the principle, that &s;ome oth|er cau&s;e mu&s;t act with infection, to render this pe&s;tilence epidem|ic, or to give it effect. The con&s;equence is unavoidable, that the infecting cau&s;e, is <HI>not</HI> a <HI>&s;pecific contagion.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, the infecting power of the plague and other autumnal di&s;ea&s;es, is &s;u&s;ceptible of gradation, from the lowe&s;t point of danger, up to the highe&s;t; a circum&s;tance that does not characterize the &s;pecific contagion of &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les. In America, we have &s;een the di&s;ea&s;e in every &s;tage of virulence, except perhaps the very highe&s;t, like that in the days of Gallus and Volu&s;ian, that in the time of Evagrius, or that in the reign of Edward III, and a few others. The di&s;ea&s;e in Philadelphia in 1797 was more infectious than that in 1793, and that in 1798 &s;till more than either. The fever in New-York in 1795 exhibited very little infection, not one ca&s;e in twenty pro|ceeding from any communication with the &s;ick; but in 1798, the di&s;ea&s;e put on a more virulent a&s;pect, and was more generally in|fectious. In Baltimore, the di&s;ea&s;e in 1797 ran through all the grades of bilious fever, from an ordinary remittent, which for weeks prevailed without infection, to a contagious yellow fever.</P>
<P>But this is not all. During the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, and in the &s;ame city, the di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;ts in all its grades from an intermittent to the contagious yellow fever. It is a very frequent thing for per&s;ons &s;eized with decided &s;ymptoms of the pe&s;tilential fever, to have the di&s;ea&s;e reduced by early applications, to a remittent or an intermittent. Of this I am an in&s;tance my&s;elf; having contracted the malignant fever in New-York in Augu&s;t 1798, from the air of the city, for I was near no di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons, and returned home, I was &s;eized with the &s;ymptoms, tho not of the mo&s;t violent kind. The fever was di&s;turbed by early remedies, and I became convale&s;cent; but in a few days, I relap&s;ed and
<PB N="153" REF="036687_0508_100AA4AF5009F8E8">
the fever took the form of a regular tertian. Dr. Ru&s;h relates &s;imilar examples in the fever of 1793.</P>
<P>Lind, on di&s;ea&s;es of hot climates, p. 179, remarks, that patients, with a mild intermittent, &s;ent to Greenwich ho&s;pital, near a mar&s;h, in Jamaica, &s;oon grew wor&s;e, and their di&s;ea&s;e turned to a malignant yellow fever or mortal dy&s;entery.</P>
<P>A multitude of &s;uch facts have been ob&s;erved in America, which, with the remarkable hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e in Baltimore in 1797, &s;eem to amount to a demon&s;tration, that the plague and all autumnal bilious di&s;orders, are of one &s;pecies, differing only in their grades. Indeed the writers on the Levant plague, while they utterly deny &s;uch a &s;amene&s;s in kind between that di&s;ea&s;e and any other, have recorded facts to prove the doctrin here maintained.</P>
<P>P. Ru&s;&s;el admits that the plague in Aleppo was of very vari|ous degrees of malignity, and was not always infectious. He has even arranged the ca&s;es in &s;everal di&s;tinct cla&s;&s;es, according to the various &s;ymptoms and degrees of mortality.</P>
<P>Lady W. Montague, in letter 31, has the following ob&s;erva|tions. "Tho&s;e dreadful &s;tories you have heard of the plague, have very little foundation in truth. I own I have much ado to reconcile my&s;elf to the &s;ound of a word which has always given me &s;uch terrible ideas; tho I am convinced there is little more in it than in a fever." She then proceeds to relate, how &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal infected towns, that her cook was taken ill, and &s;he was told, with a great cold&mdash;that &s;he left her doctor to attend him, but the cook &s;oon recovered, and both cook and doctor in a few days, arrived in health at Adrianople. She was then &s;urpri&s;ed to learn, that her cook had been ill with the plague. She concludes, from her own experience, that the air is never infected and that it is as ea&s;y to root the plague out of Turkey, as out of Italy and France.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;ea&s;e was "rooted out of France," it hap|pened that, in two years after Lady Montague wrote her letter, Mar|&s;eilles was almo&s;t depopulated by the di&s;ea&s;e!</NOTE> She remarks al&s;o that "many e&s;cape it"&mdash;which is certainly wonderful!</P>

&s;ingle cur&s;ory ob&s;ervation, or an i&s;olated fact; a practice among travellers, as among men of pretended &s;cience, which is the &s;ource of numberle&s;s errors. It is undoubtedly true, that the plague is often "little more than a fever;" but if Lady Mon|tague had been in Cairo in 1580, or in 1736, or in Con&s;tanti|nople in 543, or in 1751, or in London in 1665, or in Mar|&s;eilles in 1720, &s;he would have thought the plague &s;omething more than an ordinary fever. The truth is, the di&s;ea&s;e exhibits dif|ferent grades of violence, at different times.</P>
<P>Savary remarks, that &s;uch as <HI>catch</HI> the plague in Egypt in June, July and Augu&s;t are always cured.</P>
<P>So ob&s;erves Mignot, in his hi&s;tory of the Turki&s;h empire, vol. 2. p. 4, "the plague at certain times, is incurable; at oth|ers, ea&s;y to be cured. The contagion is more or le&s;s &s;trong, according to the &s;tate of the air."</P>
<P>Similar remarks occcur in the Trait&eacute; de la pe&s;te. The author is full of his idea of contagion, but he &s;ays, the plague, tho al|ways from one cau&s;e, appears differently in different places, and a &s;mall di&s;tance between them makes it appear like two different di&s;ea&s;es, as at Montpelier and at Lyons.</P>
<P>Chandler, in his travels, gives us wonderful di&s;coveries on this &s;ubject. He &s;ays, the di&s;ea&s;e proceeds from certain invi&s;ible animalcules, burrowing and forming their ne&s;t in the human body. The&s;e are imported annually into Smyrna&mdash;they are lea&s;t fatal at the beginning, and latter end of the &s;ea&s;on. If they ar|rive early in the &s;pring, they are weak, but gather &s;trength, mul|tiply and then peri&s;h!!</P>
<P>Such &s;illy opinions are gravely recorded in books, yet they prove that infection is of very different degrees of &s;trength, or that it is the &s;tate of the air, and not infection, which produces the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>P. Alpinus, followed by Volney, Savary and others, &s;peaks of this difference in the malignity of the plague; but he a&s;cribes it to the <HI>place</HI> where the di&s;ea&s;e originates. He &s;ays, the conta|gion from Barbary is more putrid and virulent, than from Greece and Syria, and in&s;tances that of 1580.</P>

<P><PB N="155" REF="036687_0510_100AA4B3C5A37370">It is true that &s;ome of the mo&s;t violent plagues have fir&s;t ap|peared in Ethiopia or Barbary, as in the time of Thucydides, in 252, in 1580, in 1736; but the&s;e writers ought to have re|collected that others equally violent have originated in Egypt, in China, in Italy and in Con&s;tantinople. Witne&s;s that in 542 which began near Pelu&s;ium in Lower Egypt, tho&s;e of 1347 and of 1450 which began in China or other parts of A&s;ia, and that of 745 which commenced in Calabria, in the kingdom of Naples. They might have ob&s;erved al&s;o, that many plagues, of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive kind, have appeared at once in twenty or more of the cities of Europe. The&s;e con&s;iderations would have detected the puerilty of the notion, that contagion from one country is more "putrid and virulent" than from another, and led the ob&s;ervers of nature to the true cau&s;e of the&s;e different grades of malignan|cy, different &s;tates of the atmo&s;phere in different periods.</P>
<P>Fernelius divides epidemics into three kinds: An epidemy from exhalations or vapor from the earth; from great changes of &s;ea&s;ons; and from an occult, malignant quality in the air; the la&s;t, he maintains, is the only true cau&s;e of the pe&s;tis; the others are preparatory to it; but the&s;e cau&s;es often unite, and the plague then becomes mo&s;t &s;evere. Putrid exhalations do not a|lone produce the plague, but prepare for it and aid its progre&s;s. Hence it does not affect all places or all men alike&mdash;but is mo&s;t &s;evere in maritime places; in tho&s;e expo&s;ed to the &s;outh; warm and humid, abounding with impure exhalations.</P>
<BIBL>De Morb. Pe&s;t. 189.</BIBL>
<P>There is a great deal of truth in the&s;e ob&s;ervations, and I cannot but remark how much more correct the&s;e authors are who often &s;aw the plague, than Mead and others who had no &s;uch advantages.</P>
<P>The violence of the pe&s;tilential principle, aided by &s;ea&s;ons re|markably debilitating, has &s;ometimes di&s;patched the human race, with terrible rapidity. The more u&s;ual cour&s;e of the plague is from five to &s;even days, when death or a favorable cri&s;is takes place. But to this there have been &s;ome di&s;mal exceptions. The di&s;ea&s;e de&s;cribed by Evagrius in 590, generally put an end to life in three days. This al&s;o was the period of the cri&s;is in

the dreadful plague, in the days of Vortigern, in 448, and the &s;ub&s;equent years. In the &s;imilar calamity of 1348, few patients lived beyond the third day.</P>
<P>In many in&s;tances, during the&s;e more general plagues, per|&s;ons have died &s;uddenly, as in an apoplexy; as in the pe&s;tilence at Narbonne in 1534, where men frequently fell dead as they were walking or conver&s;ing; of which Skenkius him&s;elf was of|ten an eye-witne&s;s. He cites as authorities for the &s;ame fact, Valleriola, Gemma, Salius and Cardanus. See page 765. The &s;ame happened in the pe&s;tilence de&s;cribed by Evagrius; and au|thors relate that no le&s;s than eighty per&s;ons, fell dead in a pro|ce&s;&s;ion in&s;tituted by St. Gregory, about the year 590.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This di&s;ea&s;e &s;ometimes attacks in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rm of an apoplexy; in other ca&s;es, per&s;ons are indi&s;po&s;ed, for &s;ome days, but able to walk, while the di&s;ea&s;e is &s;ecretly undermining the animal powers.

<P>Terrible indeed mu&s;t be that virulence of the pe&s;tilential prin|ciple, which bids defiance to cold. Yet &s;uch has been the ca&s;e in a number of plagues.

The di&s;|ea&s;e in Provence in 1720, was not controlled by the rigors of winter.

<P>The rea&s;on of this diver&s;ity is very obvious. The pe&s;tilence which appears in winter, in northern latitudes, can proceed only from a di&s;po&s;ition of the atmo&s;phere; for cold totally de&s;troys all infection of that di&s;ea&s;e, and all the influence of putrid ex|halations. Whenever therefore the plague invades man in cold weather, it demon&s;trates a <HI>more malignant</HI> &s;tate of the air, and one that is not controlled by cold weather or fro&s;t. Such a &s;tate of the air mu&s;t of cour&s;e produce more fatal effects, than an in|ferior force in the pe&s;tilential principle, which perhaps requires the aid of heat, humidity and noxious exhalations to produce a very violent plague. Thanks to heaven, mo&s;t of the pe&s;tilences that afflict mankind are of this latter, or &s;ubordinate degree; in which the real plague is limited to places highly charged with morbid &s;ub&s;tances, which it is in the power of man to di&s;&s;ipate or remove. A va&s;t proportion of all pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es are found to rage only in cities, jails, camps, and crowded &s;hips, and may be avoided or mitigated by human means.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, hi&s;torical facts warrant me in believing, that the pe&s;tilential principle does, at times, acquire a virulence, that proves fatal to life, in every &s;ea&s;on and every &s;ituation; a&s;&s;ailing indi&s;criminately the city and the cottage; the cleanly dwellings of the rich and the filthy cells of the poor; the highe&s;t hills, as well as the valleys, the borders of mora&s;&s;es, and the nau&s;eous alleys of a populous town. During this melancholy &s;tate of the elements of life, and &s;uch was their condition during the rava|ges of the black pe&s;tilence in the reign of Edward III. men are however not to de&s;pair of pre&s;erving life; but the means con&s;i&s;t in applications to the human body, calculated to guard, not again&s;t infection &s;o much, as again&s;t <HI>debility,</HI> the deciding proxi|mate cau&s;e of the malady.</P>
<P>Hi&s;torians mention a remarkable difference in the operation of the two very furious plagues, in 1348 and 1361. That of 1348 was mo&s;t fatal to the poor; but that of 1361 was mo&s;t mortal among the nobility and gentry, and on hills and mountains, which
<PB N="158" REF="036687_0513_100AA4BA234E2988">
u&s;ually e&s;cape. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e then, morbid exhalations con&s;ti|tuted an influential cau&s;e in producing the malady&mdash;in the latter ca&s;e, they operated as a &s;hield or anti&s;ceptic&mdash;and the facts de|mon&s;trate the various force of the elemental cau&s;es.</P>
<P>In the third place, to give effect to the infection of the plague, and at times, to other autumnal di&s;ea&s;es, there mu&s;t be an apt or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> di&s;po&s;ition in the human body. This is admitted by Hip|pocrates, who ob&s;erves that body differs from body, the nature of one man, from that of another, the nutriment of one, from that of another, and the &s;ame things are not alike pernicious to one &s;pecies of animals, as to another. Hence he accounts for di&s;ea&s;es invading one kind of animals at one time, another &s;pe|cies at a different time, and different &s;pecies having their various di&s;tempers.</P>
<BIBL>Lib. de flatibus.</BIBL>
<P>Thus Galen remarks, that the &s;ame cau&s;es do not affect all per&s;ons alike; if they did, violent heat, exce&s;&s;ive fatigue or drinking or anger, or grief, would produce fever in every per|&s;on; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, all per&s;ons alike would be &s;eized with pe&s;tilence, during the reign of the dog-&s;tar.</P>
<BIBL>De dif. &s;eb. cap. 4.</BIBL>
<P>In conformity to the&s;e ideas, Diemerbroeck, p. 50, lays it down as a principle, that no per&s;on will receive infection, unle&s;s his body has an <HI>aptitudinem,</HI> a fitne&s;s, or di&s;po&s;ition to receive it, ari&s;ing from &s;ome &s;ecret quality or bad &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>On this point, we rea&s;on without knowing cau&s;es; all we can do is to collect and arrange facts, which decide in favor of this hypothe&s;is. We are compelled to admit the principle, not only as it re&s;pects the operation of infection, but al&s;o of the ele|mental or primary atmo&s;pheric cau&s;e of pe&s;tilence, which makes an evident di&s;tinction, at times, between per&s;ons of different habits, families, and nations.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical men are not agreed, as to the nature of what is called <HI>pre|di&s;po&s;ition.</HI> Brown, in Elements of Medicin, defines it to be a le&s;s degree of the di&s;ea&s;e; that is, the commencement of the di&s;ea&s;e. I &s;u&s;pect this definition, properly limited, to be nearly ju&s;t. It is probable that all fevers are the effects of debility, and that when this debility com|mences, a per&s;on may be &s;aid to be <HI>predi&s;po&s;ed to di&s;ea&s;e;</HI> altho the di&s;ea&s;e may not be formed in many days or weeks after, or may be prevented by early applications.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="036687_0514_100AA4BBC7CA2400">The&s;e facts came under the ob&s;ervation of Procopius and Eva|grius. In 543, &s;ays the former, no phy&s;ician or attendant caught the di&s;temper&mdash;while many were &s;eized they knew not from what cau&s;e and &s;uddenly died. Many, &s;ays Evagrius, who fled from infected places, remained &s;afe them&s;elves, while they communi|cated the di&s;ea&s;e to others. Many who remained with the &s;ick and freely handled them, wholly e&s;caped. Others, in de&s;pair for the lo&s;s of friends, threw them&s;elves in the way of infection, but were not able to contract the di&s;ea&s;e; while others received the di&s;ea&s;e by the &s;lighte&s;t connection with infected hou&s;es, or in open market.</P>
<P>We have many memorable examples of a &s;imilar nature in A|merica &mdash;they are too numerous to be &s;pecified. I &s;u&s;pect how|ever that four fifths of &s;uch ca&s;es are improperly a&s;cribed to infec|tion.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck relates that in the height of the plague at Nimeguen, the air was &s;o bad, that all places were nearly a|like, as to the danger of infection; per&s;ons received the di&s;ea&s;e with or without intercour&s;e with the &s;ick.</P>
<P>Sometimes the plague di&s;criminates between natives of differ|ent countries. The French fugitives from the We&s;t-Indies, who have re&s;ided in our cities during pe&s;tilence have generally e&s;caped. This is not however very remarkable; as they are accu&s;tomed to a climate which is, like our &s;ummers, peculiarly fitted to pro|duce a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e; at the &s;ame time, their manner of living is better &s;uited to the warm &s;ea&s;on, than that of our own citizens.</P>
<P>But a &s;imilar di&s;crimination has been often ob&s;erved, among natives of the &s;ame latitudes, or nearly the &s;ame. Thus Carda|nus, lib. 8, relates that in a pe&s;tilence at Ba&s;le, the Swi&s;s only were affected; the French, Italians and Germans e&s;caped. John Utenhovius relates that in a plague in Denmark, all &s;trangers, as Engli&s;h, Germans and Hollanders e&s;caped, altho they re&s;ided in families and a&s;&s;ociated freely with the infected. The Sudor Anglicus, when it fir&s;t appeared in England, attacked none but the Engli&s;h; but in &s;ub&s;equent pe&s;tilential con&s;titutions, it inva|ded almo&s;t all Europe.</P>
<P>We have in America mo&s;t illu&s;trious examples of the di&s;tinc|tion above mentioned. In the &s;weeping pe&s;tilence of 1618, when
<PB N="160" REF="036687_0515_100AA4BD5A77CD78">
almo&s;t all the Indians peri&s;hed, on a tract of three hundred miles in extent, &s;ome white men wintered in the country and a&s;&s;ociated freely with the &s;ick, without injury. In a &s;imilar pe&s;tilence a|mong the Indians on Nantucket, in 1763, not a white man was affected, tho never &s;o much expo&s;ed to infection. Two or three other in&s;tances have come to my knowledge. A like di&s;crimi|nation took place in Egypt in the time of Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>Sometimes the plague &s;ingles out particular families. Thus Diemerbroeck ob&s;erved in the plague at Nimeguen, whole fami|lies, by a &s;ecret &s;ympathy, were &s;eized all at one time; and in &s;ome in&s;tances, where the members of the &s;ame family lived, at a di&s;tance from each other, in different parts of the city, they were all attacked nearly at the &s;ame time. What is more remark|able, the &s;ame fact was repeatedly ob&s;erved, where the members of the &s;ame family lived in different towns. Of this there were many exemples. One man by the name of Van Dans, to pre|&s;erve his children from infection, &s;ent two of them to Gorcum in Holland, to re&s;ide with his friends, and kept the third at home. There was no pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e in Gorcum, at that time, and the two children remained in health for two or three months; but at la&s;t both were &s;eized with the plague and died, at the &s;ame time that the father and another child died with it in Nimeguen. The mother was &s;eized, but recovered. About the &s;ame time, a &s;i&s;ter, and two or three other children, re&s;iding with another &s;i&s;ter, at a di&s;tance, and &s;everal more remote relations of the fam|ily, all peri&s;hed with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>So it is related by Evagrius, who was &s;urpri&s;ed at the fact, that particular families, &s;ometimes only one or two, were arre&s;|ted by the plague, while all the other inhabitants of the city re|mained in health. But he remarks further, that tho&s;e who e&s;ca|ped, the fir&s;t year, experienced the like calamity in the next. This fact, by the way, is common, and &s;hould have led Evagri|us and others to ob&s;erve the progre&s;&s;ivene&s;s of the pe&s;tilential cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Pliny, lib. 7. ca. 50, remarks that old people are u&s;ually ex|empt from attacks of the plague; but that all nations are &s;ubject to pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, which invade them by kinds or cla&s;&s;es,
<PB N="161" REF="036687_0516_100AA4C11F50C110">
&s;ometimes falling on &s;ervants, &s;ometimes on nobles, and on oth|ers by grades or ranks. Nature, &s;ays this author, has even pre|&s;cribed certain laws to di&s;ea&s;es. The la&s;t remark &s;hould have excited the minds of phy&s;icians to di&s;cover the&s;e laws. Such laws certainly exi&s;t, and epidemics of all kinds are connected in principle.</P>
<P>I have met with other in&s;tances of di&s;crimination, perhaps more remarkable. One is related from John Helwigius, in Bo|netus' Collection of Northern Medicine, page 228. In 1621, when the &s;mall-pox raged with great mortality, it was remarked that per&s;ons of the &s;ame blood, as brothers, cou&s;ins and other relatives, living at a great di&s;tance from each other, and as far as from Nuremberg to Lyons in France, were &s;eized with the di&s;ea&s;e at one and the &s;ame time. I draw no important con&s;e|quences from this fact, becau&s;e this di&s;ea&s;e is not <HI>limited</HI> to par|ticular families, altho it may &s;eize one family before it does another.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance is related by Van Swieten, Vol. 16, from Hei&s;ter, an author of undoubted credit. At Altdorf, in Fran|conia, broke out in 1711, a malignant fever, approaching to the plague in violence, but not with the glandular tumors. This di&s;ea&s;e attacked none, but the &s;tudents or others of the univer&s;ity; but it &s;eized them wherever they were di&s;per&s;ed in private fami|lies, in all parts of the town. It &s;eized the profe&s;&s;ors al&s;o and their families, but went no farther by infection. It attacked al&s;o the printer to the univer&s;ity and his workmen, tho at a di&s;tance from the college; while another printer, contiguous to the col|lege, e&s;caped. Students al&s;o belonging to the univer&s;ity, tho at home, as at Nuremburg, were &s;eized. It was thus re&s;tricted in its attacks, and exhibited no infection, beyond the&s;e de&s;criptions of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be omitted, that this was a very &s;ickly period in all the north of Europe. In this &s;ame year, the plague raged in Copenhagen, and it had in the preceding years, &s;pread over Po|land and along the Baltic.</P>
<P>This fact at Altdorf is by far the mo&s;t &s;ingular, that I have found in hi&s;tory; but that a violent di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould attack per&s;ons of one blood, and not of another, is le&s;s &s;urprizing. We have
<PB N="162" REF="036687_0517_100AA4C329E87078">
recent proofs of this di&s;crimination in America. In 1796, three per&s;ons of one name in Hartford, two brothers and a cou&s;in, were &s;uddenly &s;eized with a violent fever, of a putrid tendency, tho in winter, and carried off within a few days of each other. At the &s;ame time, two or three others of the family were &s;eized le&s;s violently in the &s;ame town and recovered; and what is more &s;ingular, two other brothers, one in Litchfield, 30 miles from Hartford, and another in New-York, 130 miles di&s;tant, were attacked nearly at the &s;ame time, and were very ill, but &s;urvived. No infection could have exi&s;ted in mo&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;es, as the per|&s;ons did not &s;ee each other.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A curious fact is related to me by Dr. Dutton of Oxford, in Der|by. In the year 1795, almo&s;t every <HI>male</HI> child, born in the beginning of the year, in that and the adjacent towns, died within a fortnight by convul&s;ions, but <HI>no female</HI> child was affected. This was ob&s;erved to be more frequent in families that had been affected by the &s;carlatina, in the preceding year.</P>
<P>It will be remarked that this was near the di&s;trict of country which had &s;uffered by a pe&s;tilential fever and dy&s;entery.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Another in&s;tance occurred in Cambridge, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and is &s;tated to me by the attending phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>In October 1791, a young woman, belonging to a family in that town, but who had, for two years, lived at a di&s;tance of three miles from her father's hou&s;e, was &s;eized with a putrid bil|ious fever. Her mother repaired to the place and nur&s;ed her, till &s;he was convale&s;cent. None of the family vi&s;ited her while &s;ick, except the father occa&s;ionally, and her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter. The latter took the place of the mother, for a few days, who was called home to attend two other children who were &s;eized with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, and who had never been expo&s;ed to infection. Before the&s;e recovered, three others were taken with the fever in the &s;ame family. The three la&s;t had doubtle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted in nur&s;|ing the &s;ick or been into their rooms, and therefore might have been infected.</P>
<P>In April following, another of the children, who had lived at a di&s;tance from the family and had not been permitted to &s;ee any of the &s;ick, was &s;eized with the &s;ame fever, at the hou&s;e where &s;he lived. In the &s;ame month, the father and another child, were taken with it at home. Not one of the family, at
<PB N="163" REF="036687_0518_100AA4C55039FDE0">
home or abroad, e&s;caped, except the mother, who had nur&s;ed all the &s;ick, except one, and was mo&s;t expo&s;ed to infection. The di&s;ea&s;ed were very offen&s;ive, but all recovered, except one; and neither my informant, the attending phy&s;ician, nor any nur&s;e or vi&s;itor, out of the family, was in the lea&s;t injured by infection.</P>
<BIBL>M. S. letter from Dr. Wm. Gamage.</BIBL>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e was a family pe&s;tilence, which began in autumn, was &s;u&s;pended by the cold of winter, and revived in &s;pring. It re&s;embles, on a &s;mall &s;cale, the great plagues in London and Mar&s;eilles, and many others, in which a few ca&s;es occurred, in the preceding autumn, clearly marking a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air, in that particular city, which &s;tate was arre&s;ted in its operation by cold in winter, but again exhibited its effects in &s;pring.</P>
<P>The limitation of the di&s;ea&s;e to a particular family, of the &s;ame blood, or di&s;po&s;ition to be affected by a certain morbid &s;tate of air, is a my&s;terious phenomenon, but the fact is &s;o well a&s;|certained, as to leave no room to que&s;tion its exi&s;tence. We can a&s;cribe it only to a general &s;tate of air, fitted to produce injuri|ous or fatal effects on bodies of a particular temperament, which temperament or di&s;po&s;ition con&s;i&s;ts in the invi&s;ible &s;tructure or organization. It is demon&s;trated that infection cannot be the only cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;es in the&s;e families; and of cour&s;e we are compelled to admit the exi&s;tence of another cau&s;e, which can only be the atmo&s;phere, for no other cau&s;e extends its operation to the di&s;tance at which the effects were produced.</P>
<P>It is on this principle alone that particular per&s;ons or families e&s;cape the wor&s;t plagues that have afflicted mankind, as related by Evagrius, and all authors on the &s;ubject, and of which we have numerous in&s;tances in America. But,</P>
<LG>
<L>"Why drew Mar&s;eilles' good bi&s;hop purer breath,</L>
<L>When nature &s;ickened and each gale was death?"</L>
</LG>
<P>is the interrogatory of an inimitable poet, which has never been an&s;wered; for on this &s;ubject, as on every other, we are baffled and confounded, when we attempt to reach primary natural cau|&s;es. The interior organization of animals and vegetables, is far beyond the limits of human inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="036687_0519_100AA4C7C41F8EA8">Lord Veruclam has left a pa&s;&s;age confirmatory of the foregoing principles. "The plague, &s;ays this great ob&s;erver of facts, is not ea&s;ily received by tho&s;e that continually attend the &s;ick, as phy&s;icians; nor again by old people, and &s;uch as are of a dry, cold complexion. On the other hand, the plague &s;oone&s;t &s;eizes tho&s;e that come out of fre&s;h air, tho&s;e that are fa&s;ting and chil|dren. It is al&s;o noted to go in a blood, more than from &s;tran|ger to &s;tranger."</P>
<BIBL>Works, Vol. 3.</BIBL>
<P>It is in analogy with the foregoing facts, that animals of differ|ent &s;pecies are affected with epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, which bear a &s;i|militude in their predominant &s;ymptoms, at different &s;tages of a pe&s;tilential con&s;titution of air. Sometimes, hor&s;es, cattle and &s;heep feel the operation of the de&s;tructive principle, at the &s;ame time with man. At other times, this principle will affect cattle a year before it reaches mankind. Sometimes, it fir&s;t a&s;&s;ails the human race, and afterwards the irrational parts of creation. In &s;ome years one &s;pecies of animals is affected; the next year, a|nother. Thus hor&s;es experienced the epidemic of 1793, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, in the winter following the plague in that city. The cats peri&s;hed in 1797. The fi&s;h in James' river died in 1797, the oy&s;ters on the &s;hores of Connecticut &s;ickened in 1794, and the fowls in Connecticut in 1796.</P>
<P>Not unfrequently, the force of the pe&s;tilential principle, in one country, &s;eems to expend it&s;elf principally on the brute creation; while, in the &s;ame year, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, its principal ope|ration, in a neighboring country, is experienced by mankind. Thus in 1712 and 13, a very pe&s;tilential period, the cattle in Italy, Germany and other places received the full force of the pe&s;tilence, in a de&s;olating epidemic, while in Au&s;tria, Hungary and the ea&s;t, the pe&s;tilence fell on men. Thus al&s;o in 1770, while a dreadful plague was raging in Turkey and Poland, a mor|tal di&s;temper &s;wept away the cattle in Holland, Flanders and &s;ome parts of England, and malignant fevers prevailed in &s;ome parts of America.</P>
<P>That the great general cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;es, among the differ|ent &s;pecies of animals, is the &s;ame, is obvious from this con&s;id|eration, that during the &s;ame con&s;titution of air, or pe&s;tilential
<PB N="165" REF="036687_0520_100AA4CA6F05FAA8">
period, the di&s;ea&s;es of man and bea&s;t have a number of &s;imilar &s;ymptoms; &s;uch was the fact in Au&s;tria, Italy and Germany in 1712 and 13; and &s;uch has been the ca&s;e in the United States.</P>
<P>In conformity with the general principle above mentioned, we ob&s;erve that however analogous may be the &s;ymptoms of di&s;ea&s;es in man and bea&s;t, the di&s;tempers of one rarely infect the other. Infection is limited u&s;ually to that &s;pecies of animals, which have an aptne&s;s to receive the operation of the primary atmo&s;pheric cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. Thus di&s;ea&s;ed hor&s;es do not infect men, nor di&s;ea&s;ed men, hor&s;es. So when a plague attacks the natives of a particular country only, the infection, like the primary cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, is re&s;tricted in its operation to tho&s;e particular peo|ple. But this is rarely or never the ca&s;e with the &s;pecific conta|gion of the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les, in regard to mankind.</P>
<P>Authors indeed relate that hogs, dogs and poultry, feeding on highly infected articles, or wallowing in the filth thrown from hou&s;es, during the plague, have died with a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e. A few in&s;tances are mentioned by Diemerbroeck, Boccace and others. Hodges mentions a di&s;ea&s;e taken from a hor&s;e, which cea&s;ed without becoming epidemic.</P>
<P>But the&s;e i&s;olated facts form no exception to the general rule; for &s;uch di&s;tempers never &s;pread and become epidemic. They only prove my general doctrin, that the contagious quality of plague, is not a &s;pecific principle, but a quality capable of every po&s;&s;ible degree of force&mdash;that in its lower or more attenuated forms, it affects few or no per&s;ons whatever; but it <HI>may</HI> be &s;o concentrated or conden&s;ed, as to de&s;troy life, not only in bodies of an aptitude to receive the poi&s;on, but al&s;o in other &s;pecies of animals, which have no &s;uch aptitude. Hence, the poi&s;on gen|erated in the clothes of the &s;ick, when put into che&s;ts or pack|ages, unclean&s;ed, in hot weather, may be &s;o concentrated or in|crea&s;ed by fermentation, as to kill almo&s;t in&s;tantly, the per&s;on who opens them. But an infectious di&s;ea&s;e thus produced, will never &s;pread far, without the aid of a &s;tate of air which is pe&s;ti|lential. On the other hand, from thou&s;ands of in&s;tances in books, and within the knowledge of Americans, who are annu|ally, monthly and weekly receiving infection from the We&s;t-Indies,
<PB N="166" REF="036687_0521_100AA4CBF5A5FA70">
we know that the infection &s;oon di&s;appears in a healthy con&s;titution of air. It may be &s;o virulent as to give di&s;ea&s;e to the per&s;ons who fir&s;t approach it; but in the&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e is ex|tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be further remarked, as a u&s;eful hint, that per&s;ons removing &s;uddenly from fre&s;h ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to an infected place, are doubly expo&s;ed. The increa&s;e of the pe&s;tilential cau&s;es is u&s;ually grad|ual; therefore per&s;ons who live within their operation, are in|&s;en&s;ibly fitted, by the flexible texture of the &s;y&s;tem, to &s;u&s;tain their effects. But &s;udden changes are very dangerous. The body will hardly ever &s;u&s;tain great changes in the powers of ex|citement, when &s;uddenly made. Hence the extreme danger of removing from fre&s;h to infected air; and &s;ometimes, of removing from infected to fre&s;h air. The &s;udden alteration in the &s;timu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us operating on the &s;y&s;tem, may be as fatal in one ca&s;e as the other.</P>
<P>Another di&s;tingui&s;hing circum&s;tance, in pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd one that deci&s;ively marks different grades of violence in the cau&s;es, is, the manner in which the di&s;ea&s;e invades neighboring cities. It is always ob&s;erved, that during the prevalence of the plague, it attacks cities or towns at &s;ome di&s;tance, in one year, leaving other towns in the intervals between them, untouched; the next year perhaps, or the &s;econd year after, it invades tho&s;e intermediate towns which had e&s;caped. This is always the fact, and it has puzzled all authors who have related it; yet the fact has never been accounted for, as its cau&s;es have never been un|der&s;tood. Mead, who was not per&s;onally acquainted with this di&s;ea&s;e and who&s;e theory led him to explain all its phenomena by contagion, was greatly embarra&s;&s;ed with this fact. He in|&s;tances the e&s;cape of Vicenza, in Italy, 1575, when Verona and Padua, one on each &s;ide of Vicenza, were &s;everely afflicted; and in the next year, Vicenza was de&s;olated, when Verona and Padua were exempt. He could not explain how the infection, which came from Trent, where the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appeared, &s;hould <HI>pa&s;s over Vicenza</HI> and reach a more di&s;tant city.</P>
<P>Erroneous theories are the &s;ource of innumerable mi&s;chiefs in &s;cience. The fact is a common one, and on a ju&s;t view of the cau&s;es of pe&s;tilence, is very ea&s;ily explained. And what is
<PB N="167" REF="036687_0522_100AA4CD80ADB8A8">
&s;urprizing, Procopius and Evagrius have recorded facts which afford a clue to the &s;ecret, altho medical writers, from their days to the pre&s;ent time, have &s;uffered them to pa&s;s without no|tice. Procopius mentions that the pe&s;tilence which began in 542, &s;pread over the earth, but "if it pa&s;&s;ed by a particular country at fir&s;t, or <HI>&s;lightly affected it,</HI> it &s;oon returned upon it with the &s;ame de&s;olating rage, which other places had experi|enced." Evagrius al&s;o remarks, that "&s;ome places were more &s;lightly affected;" and in another pa&s;&s;age he &s;ays, that in &s;ome cities a few families were &s;eized the fir&s;t year, and the re&s;t of the city, the year following.</P>
<P>Here we have a clue to the my&s;tery. The plague &s;eizes fir&s;t the cities and towns where the <HI>general,</HI> or <HI>local cau&s;es</HI> are the mo&s;t powerful. Thus, the plague of 1575, which puzzled Mead &s;o much, commenced in Trent on the Adige, which, all geographers agree, is a mo&s;t unhealthy place. It next attacked Verona and Padua for a &s;imilar rea&s;on, and afterwards Vicenza, the intermediate town. The general cau&s;e, in the elements, had been four or five years in operation, producing a fatal &s;potted fe|ver, in mo&s;t parts of Europe, continually increa&s;ing in malig|nancy, until it aro&s;e to the plague, and its cri&s;is mu&s;t naturally be in places where it was mo&s;t aided by local cau&s;es, or where the general cau&s;e fir&s;t increa&s;ed to its full force.</P>
<P>The &s;light pe&s;tilences mentioned by Procopius and Evagrius, were the <HI>precur&s;ors</HI> of the &s;evere plagues to follow; preci&s;ely as in London and Mar&s;eilles, a terrible plague was preceded, in a former year, with malignant fevers and a few ca&s;es of plague. All hi&s;tory affords a ti&s;&s;ue of proof, that the plague is never an i&s;olated di&s;ea&s;e, &s;tarting up &s;uddenly from infection; but the <HI>cri&s;is of a &s;eries of violent di&s;ea&s;es.</HI> To this I challenge the par|tizans of &s;pecific contagion to name an exception.</P>
<P>In America, we are able to &s;olve the phenomenon of the e&s;|cape of places intervening between infected towns. We find, without an exception, that when two cities are infe&s;ted with pe&s;|tilence, and an intervening place is not, if that intervening town is to be attacked the following year, the precur&s;ors of the di&s;|ea&s;e appear there, during the pe&s;tilence in the towns on each &s;ide

of it. Thus the late &s;eries of plagues <HI>began</HI> in New-York in 1791, in Water and Front &s;treets, where the <HI>local</HI> cau&s;es were mo&s;t powerful. At this time, appeared &s;poradic ca&s;es of bilious fever, more malignant than u&s;ual, in various parts of the country, every where, indicating the commencement of a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air.</P>
<P>In 1792, the&s;e indications continued, and in a few ca&s;es ap|peared the &s;carlatina, a new evidence of the reigning con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>In 1793, the cri&s;is arrived in Philadelphia, with &s;erious mor|tality; and the indications of pe&s;tilence appeared in a great in|crea&s;e of mortality, in many parts of the country.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of this year, New-Haven, which was to be next attacked, began to &s;how the forerunners of the di&s;ea&s;e, in the &s;carlatina, and in an increa&s;e of mortality of about one fifth. In the next &s;ummer 1794 appeared the bilious plague. In the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on appeared the di&s;ea&s;e in Baltimore, di&s;tant from New-Haven about 290 miles, while Philadelphia and New-York, in|tervening cities, e&s;caped. But let it be ob&s;erved, that a num|ber of ca&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e occurred in Philadelphia; and New-York which was to be a&s;&s;ailed in the next &s;ea&s;on, produced its precur&s;ors, in about thirty ca&s;es of violent bilious fever, ending in black vomit. Thus while on the extremes, New-Haven and Baltimore were &s;everely vi&s;ited, the approaching pe&s;tilence was announced in New-York, by a pe&s;tilential atmo&s;phere, of a le&s;s degree of malignancy.</P>
<P>In 1795 appeared the epidemic in New-York and in Norfolk, Virginia; while Philadelphia and Baltimore, intermediate cities, e&s;caped, altho the heat and humidity of the &s;ea&s;on every where rendered the country unhealthy. In this year the pe&s;tilential principle &s;howed it&s;elf in New-London and Providence, in di&s;|tinctly marked ca&s;es of the bilious plague.</P>
<P>In 1796, &s;cattering ca&s;es occurred in the northern parts of America. In Newburyport, pe&s;tilence prevailed, but preceded by an increa&s;e of mortality, its precur&s;or. The &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e prevailed in Bo&s;ton, New-York, and Charle&s;ton, while inter|mediate towns e&s;caped.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="036687_0524_100AA4D27970AA88">In 1797, it appeared in Providence, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Norfolk, while New-York e&s;caped an epidemic, but a few very malignant ca&s;es occurred, &s;howing the exi&s;tence of the general cau&s;e.</P>
<P>So far as I can di&s;cover, not a &s;pot on the globe has ever been vi&s;ited with pe&s;tilence, without its precur&s;ors, &s;ometimes one, two or three years, but always for &s;ome months, before its in|va&s;ion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thucydides relates that the year of the plague at Athens was re|markably free from other di&s;ea&s;es preceding, and that the plague fell &s;uddenly on the citizens. This may &s;eem an exception to my remark; but is not; for all the neighboring people were collected into the city; which was be&s;ieged; a circum&s;tance alone &s;ufficient to account for the &s;udden attack of the di&s;ea&s;e.</NOTE></P>
<P>If we had bills of mortality for Vicenza, in the years 1570 to 1576, or a hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;es in the town, during that period, I pledge my&s;elf that we &s;hould find, that during the plague in Verona and Padua, on each &s;ide in 1575, &s;ome ma|lignant di&s;ea&s;e prevailed in Vicenza, which greatly &s;welled the bill of mortality for that year, and which announced, with al|mo&s;t infallible certainty, the approach of the plague. In&s;tead therefore of &s;aying Vicenza e&s;caped the pe&s;tilence, the fir&s;t year, when Verona and Padua were afflicted, we &s;hould &s;ay, the pe&s;ti|lence had <HI>commenced</HI> in le&s;s malignant di&s;tempers, but its cri&s;is in Vicenza was to be a year later. This is the whole my&s;tery, and the uniformity of this &s;eries of facts from the days of Procopius to this hour, renders it a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment, that medical and other &s;cientific men, &s;hould have overlooked this great law of epidemic pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck remarks the fact, as well as Procopius and Eva|grius, that pe&s;tilence does not invade all places at once, but now this place, now that, and thus, in a &s;eries of years, extending over the earth. See p. 50 of Diemerbroeck, and the foregoing hi&s;tory of the plagues in Ju&s;tinian's reign. But no author &s;eems to have ob&s;erved the progre&s;&s;ion of a general pe&s;tilential princi|ple, which, if it does not occa&s;ion plague in two contiguous towns, the &s;ame year, occa&s;ions plague in one, and other malig|nant di&s;ea&s;es in the other, which certainly indicate its approach.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="036687_0525_100AA4D491223330">To prove that infection has no concern in this la&s;t mentioned phenomenon, according to the theory of Mead and others, it may be ob&s;erved that the inva&s;ion of the di&s;ea&s;e in cities, is perfectly analogous to its inva&s;ion of a whole country. The di&s;ea&s;e rare|ly begins at one point and &s;preads from that, like the radii from the center of a circle, nor does it follow the nur&s;es and attend|ants of the per&s;ons fir&s;t &s;eized. On the other hand it &s;tarts up in various di&s;tant parts of the town, among people who have no in|tercour&s;e with the infected. To this, it may be alleged, the fe|vers of Philadelphia in 1793 and 7 are exceptions; but on crit|ical examination, I find they are not. That in New-Haven may be an exception. Thus Evagrius relates, that at the beginning, the plague &s;eized particular families, &s;ometimes only one or two, and the re&s;t of the town e&s;caped, till the next year.</P>
<P>Baronius from Gregory of Tours has well de&s;cribed the fir&s;t progre&s;s of the plague, in 590, in the &s;outhern cities of France. He &s;ays the di&s;ea&s;e was introduced by a ve&s;&s;el from Spain; the fir&s;t record I can find of &s;uppo&s;ed importation by water. But when introduced, it did not &s;eize every hou&s;e at one time but left intervals. "Nec &s;tatim hoc incendium luis per domos &s;pargitur totas, &s;ed interrupto certi temporis &s;patio, ac velut in &s;egetem flamma accen&s;a, urbem totam morbi incendio conflagravit." Vol. 8. 15. The metaphor here employed will appear &s;triking to tho&s;e who have &s;een a field of &s;tubble or the woods on fire, in a windy day. The fact al&s;o corre&s;ponds exactly with what has been ob&s;erved in London, Mar&s;eilles and other places, that the di&s;ea&s;e at fir&s;t &s;tarts up here and there, in remote &s;ituations; then &s;ub&s;ides for weeks perhaps, before it &s;preads and becomes popular.</P>
<P>Thus in Nimeguen, a few ca&s;es occurred in November; then there was an interval of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion; in January, more ca&s;es, and in March, the di&s;ea&s;e began to a&s;&s;ume the &s;hape of an epidemic.</P>
<BIBL>Diem. p. 6.</BIBL>
<P>In London, &s;ays Hodge, two or three per&s;ons died, in one family, with &s;ymptoms of the plague in 1664.&mdash;In the holidays, occurred another ca&s;e&mdash;but a hard fro&s;t &s;u&s;pended the action of the infection. The di&s;ea&s;ed were at fir&s;t &s;hut up and guarded; but to no purpo&s;e. An order was i&s;&s;ued and enforced, that a red cro&s;s &s;hould be &s;et on infected hou&s;es, with the&s;e words in&s;cribed, "Lord have mercy on us."&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="036687_0526_100AA4D617619880">In May and June the di&s;ea&s;e to u&s;e the author's own words, "reigned doubtfully;" &s;ometimes in one part and &s;ometimes in another; and to u&s;e Hodges quaint expre&s;&s;ion, "it kept up a running fight," alternately in&s;piring hope and fear. This de|&s;cription is le&s;s elegant than that of Baronius, but it expre&s;&s;es the &s;ame ideas of the fir&s;t progre&s;s of the plague.</P>
<P>It is &s;trange however that the writers &s;hould not have &s;een that their facts totally overthrow their own ideas of infection; it being impo&s;&s;ible, that the operation of infection &s;hould be thus &s;u&s;pended, and afterwards revived. Fro&s;t totally annihilates in|fection, altho it does not de&s;troy the atmo&s;pheric cau&s;e of di&s;ea|&s;es. Similar, in all re&s;pects, was the commencement of the plague at Mar&s;eilles in 1720. At fir&s;t a few per&s;ons died &s;udden|ly, then the di&s;ea&s;e di&s;appeared, and the citizens &s;uppo&s;ed it to be ended. Repeated hopes and fears were revived by the alter|nate appearance and di&s;appearance of the malady, for &s;ome weeks in May and June. Yet the author who has related the&s;e facts made a book to prove its origin from Levant infection! &s;o ab&s;urd are men when they attempt to &s;upport preconceived &s;y&s;tems!&mdash;</P>
<P>In America, the pe&s;tilential fever has fir&s;t made its appearance, in a &s;imilar manner. It has every where been preceded by an in|crea&s;e of mortality, and in mo&s;t places, has appeared in the &s;cattering, interrupted manner of the plagues before mentioned. In Philadelphia in 1797, and &s;till more in 1798, &s;cattering ca&s;es occurred in June and July, &s;everal weeks before the arrival of the &s;uppo&s;ed fomites, from the We&s;t-Indies. The &s;ame fact occur|red in New-York in 1795; &s;ome ca&s;es appeared two weeks be|fore the arrival of the Zephyr, the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ource of infection. In Providence occurred the &s;ame fact.</P>
<P>The whole &s;ecret of the&s;e phenomena, is, that infection has u&s;ually nothing to do with the <HI>origin</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;e, according to the decided opinion of the learned Diemerbroeck, who &s;aw the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e in Holland, and found it impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;|cribe it, in many places, to that cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why per&s;ons are &s;eized, in remote and &s;cattered &s;ituations and after different intervals of time, is, that the malig|nant principle is <HI>progre&s;&s;ive.</HI> In its &s;tate of increa&s;e, it fir&s;t pro|duces
<PB N="172" REF="036687_0527_100AA4D84BAB4E00">
di&s;ea&s;es of a le&s;s violent type, and e&s;pecially all kinds of eruptive di&s;ea&s;es and catarrhous affections; as influenza, mea&s;les, &s;mall-pox, every &s;pecies of angina, petechial fever, and la&s;tly plague. In winter, the &s;ame cau&s;e often occa&s;ions epidemic pleu|ri&s;y, or peripneumony of a mo&s;t mortal kind, and always bear|ing &s;ome likene&s;s to the epidemics of &s;ummer and autumn.</P>
<P>In this progre&s;&s;ion or increa&s;e of the pe&s;tilential principle, tho&s;e per&s;ons are fir&s;t &s;eized, who have the lea&s;t power of re&s;i&s;ting its operation. This inability may proceed from various cau&s;es. It may be occa&s;ioned by the natural organization of the body; &s;ome bodies being naturally more &s;u&s;ceptible of di&s;ea&s;e, than others. This indi&s;po&s;ition of bodies to repel the morbid action of air or other cau&s;es, is hidden from the eyes of man; but that it exi&s;ts, we have proofs in every days experience.</P>
<P>Other per&s;ons are predi&s;po&s;ed to certain di&s;ea&s;es by artificial means. Thus every exce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus, induces indirect debility, a fruitful cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;es. Hence the liability of robu&s;t people to all violent fevers.</P>
<P>Others may be expo&s;ed to pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es from living in &s;ituations, where the pe&s;tilential principle is a&s;&s;i&s;ted in its opera|tion by the debilitating qualities of morbid exhalations. Hence the early appearance and furious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avages of the plague in the nar|row &s;treets of cities, and the filthy apartments of poverty.</P>
<P>From the&s;e and other cau&s;es, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> happens that &s;ome per&s;ons are &s;eized with pe&s;tilence, long before the bodies of others yield to the action of the de&s;tructive cau&s;e. This will rationally account for all the variety of phenomena, which accompany this ferocious malady.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rea&s;oning applies to the angina maligna, which is on|ly another form of pe&s;tilence. Fothergill relates, that this di&s;|ea&s;e appeared in London in a few ca&s;es in 1739, and then di&s;ap|peared for a period of two or three years. It did not become epidemic, tho very infectious.</P>
<BIBL>Works, p. 198.</BIBL>
<P>To confirm this hypothe&s;is, I may remark that the plague is le&s;s infectious on its fir&s;t appearance. This is admitted by Ru&s;|&s;el, on the plague of Aleppo, p. 19. 300, 297 and 315. At the &s;ame time, it is agreed on all hands, to be more mortal, than
<PB N="173" REF="036687_0528_100AA4DAEC487CA0">
in its later &s;tages. If infection were the cau&s;e, the rever&s;e would be true, and the di&s;ea&s;e would be more mortal, in proportion to its exten&s;ion, and the accumulation of infectious matter. The fir&s;t ca&s;es al&s;o would be equally infectious, within the reach of their effluvia.</P>
<P>Skenkius ob&s;erves that many per&s;ons lived in infected hou&s;es, where others were di&s;ea&s;ed, for three or four weeks, without any ill effects; but they afterwards &s;ickened and died. This he a&s;cribes to an increa&s;e of infection, and recommends, as the means of prevention, changes of clothes, and liberal u&s;e of wa|ter in the apartments. The fact may be explained on this prin|ciple; or it may be, and mo&s;t probably is, the effect of the &s;low operation of the morbid air in inducing debility on particular &s;y&s;|tems. But it goes to prove that the infection of the di&s;ea&s;e is not &s;pecific contagion, but a vapor or acid, unfriendly to health, that is capable of every imaginable degree of force; &s;lighter de|grees of which require a long time to undermine the energies of life.</P>
<P>Another con&s;ideration, which decides again&s;t the origination of the plague from infection, is, that almo&s;t all other di&s;ea&s;es, whether infectious or not, exhibit the phenomena ju&s;t de&s;cribed. It is not the plague alone that appears, this year in one town, and the next in a contiguous one; or this week in one family, and the next in another; or at the &s;ame moment, in two fami|lies or towns, at &s;ome miles di&s;tance. The &s;ame phenomena characterize dy&s;entery, mea&s;les, anginas and other maladies which are infectious; and even intermittents, remittents, and &s;ome others, which are not &s;pread by infection.</P>
<P>Such was the manner in which the fatal dy&s;entery of the pe|riod about the year 1751, leaping from place to place, in differ|ent years, ravaged Connecticut, for three or four years. The &s;ame took place, with that di&s;ea&s;e, from 1773 to 1777. It was &s;cattering from place to place, during a &s;eries of years, and then almo&s;t totally di&s;appeared, for many years. Sometimes it &s;pread over a whole town; at others, it was limited to a particular &s;treet. In &s;ome in&s;tances, it &s;wept away a large part of a fam|ily; in other in&s;tances, families entirely e&s;caped. The &s;ame has been its progre&s;s, during the la&s;t five or &s;ix years. In 1794,
<PB N="174" REF="036687_0529_100AA4DF4ED4E3E8">
it ravaged Derby; in 1795, New-Haven. In 1798, it invaded a particular &s;treet in the country, two miles from Stamford, was infectious and mortal, while the town generally e&s;caped.</P>
<P>The &s;carlatina from 1793 to 1796, exhibited the &s;ame facts. Its general progre&s;s was ea&s;tward, but it often pa&s;&s;ed by a town and fir&s;t &s;eized one beyond it.</P>
<P>The angina maligna in 1735 and 6 was remarked for the &s;ame manner of appearance. It began in King&s;ton, in New-Hamp|&s;hire, but in&s;tead of a regular progre&s;s, &s;tep by &s;tep, it &s;eized Bo&s;ton, fifty miles di&s;tant, before it did Che&s;ter, only &s;ix miles di&s;tant; yet its general progre&s;s was we&s;tward, and hardly any place e&s;caped. Both this di&s;ea&s;e and the &s;carlatina of the la&s;t period, re&s;embled the plague in the&s;e other re&s;pects&mdash;they were mo&s;t mortal at fir&s;t; and they affected families with very differ|ent degrees of violence, &s;lightly troubling &s;ome, and extingui&s;h|ing the lives of all the children in others.</P>
<P>The inva&s;ion of the influenza exhibits &s;imilar facts. It &s;eizes at fir&s;t only here and there a per&s;on; afterwards it becomes gen|eral, as at Edinburgh in 1762. See E&s;&s;ays and Ob&s;. Edin. vol. 3. At other times, it has &s;eized whole towns in a night; nor does it proceed from town to town, according to their order on a map. Yet its <HI>general</HI> cour&s;e is in one direction.</P>
<P>I could produce a multitude of &s;imilar in&s;tances of pleuri&s;y, and common autumnal fevers not infectious, which appear one year, in one part of the country, and another, in another, with|out any vi&s;ible cau&s;e for this variety. The in&s;tances related by Dr. Buel of the town of Sheffield, are very di&s;tingui&s;hed. See my Collection on the Yellow Fever, p. 53 and 60. That town contains two large ponds, which make con&s;iderable mar&s;hes, that are &s;ources of remittents. In 1794, remittents of unu&s;ual vio|lence appeared within the mia&s;mata ari&s;ing from the &s;outh pond &mdash;in 1795, a &s;imilar fever raged in the vicinity of the north pond.</P>
<P>This appeared at fir&s;t an unaccountable phenomenon; but af|terwards the fever about the &s;outh pond in 1794 was a&s;cribed to the drawing off the water, and expo&s;ing great quantities of pu|tre&s;cible &s;ub&s;tances to the action of heat. But &s;till the difficulty is not removed. The north pond is admitted to be the mo&s;t
<PB N="175" REF="036687_0530_100AA4DD29A5BA58">
u&s;ual and fruitful &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;es; but the&s;e did not appear, in any extent, in 1794. The que&s;tion then is, not why the di&s;ea&s;es occurred, in that year, about the &s;outh pond, but why they did <HI>not</HI> appear about the north pond, the principal focus of &s;ickne&s;s in other years, and about which they raged with mel|ancholy effects in the two following years? No alteration is &s;ug|ge&s;ted to have been made in the circum&s;tances of the north pond; yet in one year, its exhalations were almo&s;t harmle&s;s, and in the next, they &s;pread de&s;olation over the neighborhood.</P>
<BIBL>See Medical Repo&s;itory, vol. 1. p. 458.</BIBL>
<P>In &s;uch ca&s;es, ju&s;t rea&s;oning leads us to &s;uppo&s;e the general &s;tate of the air or the local exhalations or both, differ materially in the degrees of their force and activity, in different years; but to human eyes, the cau&s;e of this difference is not often vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Sometimes a &s;evere epidemic will rage in one town and a milder epidemic of a &s;imilar type in the vicinity. Thus Zimmerman ob&s;erves, that he has known a violent diarrhea follow a &s;uppre&s;|&s;ed per&s;piration in September, in one town, when a dy&s;entery was epidemic in the neighboring country. To what &s;hall we im|pute this difference of di&s;ea&s;es, within a few miles, of each other, but to the different force of local cau&s;es? A general cau&s;e, as a hot &s;ea&s;on, may predi&s;po&s;e the body to a di&s;ea&s;e of a particular type, but this principle may be modified by innumera|ble circum&s;tances on the &s;urface of the earth.</P>
<P>In analogy with the&s;e facts, is the manner in which pe&s;tilen|tial di&s;ea&s;es invade different &s;pecies of animals. In one place, hor&s;es are &s;eized; in another, cows; in a third, &s;heep. In one year cats fall victims to pe&s;tilence; and the next, hens and gee&s;e; but infection has no concern in the&s;e phenomena; and we are to a&s;cribe them to the various force of the pe&s;tilential principle in different &s;ea&s;ons and places.</P>
<P>The phenomenon now under con&s;ideration has not e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation of other phy&s;icians in Europe. Stapfer, cited by Zimmerman on Phy&s;ic, relates that the village of Oberwyl, in the Canton of Berne, was attacked with a violent dy&s;entery in 1749, while the neighboring villages were free from the di&s;|ea&s;e. In the next year, Oberwyl was healthy, while the neigh|boring
<PB N="176" REF="036687_0531_100AA4E0F31550F8">
villages were ravaged with the &s;ame di&s;order, tho not &s;e|parated from the other by any mountain or fore&s;t. I have occa|&s;ion, &s;ays Zimmerman, to ob&s;erve &s;omething like this, almo&s;t every year.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Editor remarks on the&s;e facts, that "the dy&s;|entery, like other contagious di&s;ea&s;es, is &s;pread by communica|tion with the infected per&s;ons and clothes, and <HI>therefore</HI> it is not &s;trange that one village &s;hould e&s;cape, if its inhabitants were care|ful to avoid communication with their infected neighbors."</P>
<P>Ju&s;t &s;o important are all the rea&s;onings of the infection-&s;tick|lers! The remarks are common-place and do not reach the point of difficulty. The que&s;tion, is, to know why &s;everal villages e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e, in the year when infection was <HI>near</HI> them, and were &s;eized, the next year, when <HI>no</HI> infection exi&s;ted. The winter's cold totally extingui&s;hes the infection of that di&s;ea&s;e; &s;o that the learned Editor is left without a re&s;ource. If any in|fection had &s;urvived the fro&s;t of winter, it mu&s;t have been in the village fir&s;t infected, and in that place common &s;en&s;e and ob&s;ervation would teach us to look for a revival of the di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;ucceed|ing &s;pring. But no; that village is in perfect health, and others, where there had been no fomites, are laid wa&s;te by its ravages.&mdash; Such are the facts, and no theory of contagion is able to explain the cau&s;e of their exi&s;tence, in regard to this or any other di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The dy&s;entery al&s;o has, in &s;ome places, made the di&s;crimina|tion, ob&s;erved in the plague; &s;eizing per&s;ons of a certain nation or blood, and not affecting others who are equally expo&s;ed. In an epidemic dy&s;entery in Nimeguen, the French and Jews all e&s;caped.</P>
<BIBL>Van Swieten, vol. 16. page 57.</BIBL>
<P>There is a fact related by Hodges and Diemerbroeck re&s;pec|ting the plague which mu&s;t not be omitted. Many per&s;ons who had breathed the pe&s;tilential air of London and Nimeguen, went into the country, where they had the benefit of good air. Here they lived in health a month or two, then &s;ickened and died of the plague. This is attributed to the latent poi&s;on, which lies long inactive in the &s;y&s;tem, then operates to the de&s;truction of life. This may be the cau&s;e; but is it not more natural to a&s;cribe the fact to higher excitement from a pure air, on a debilitated
<PB N="177" REF="036687_0532_100AA4E3A65BFDF8">
&s;y&s;tem, inducing indirect debility? Or &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e that a pe&s;tilential atmo&s;phere is mo&s;t &s;timulant, and that a removal in|to a pure air, induces direct debility? Perhaps the following facts will throw &s;ome light on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In 1789, I left Hartford in October, when the influenza was &s;preading in that town, and was &s;eized with the di&s;ea&s;e ju&s;t after I arrived at Bo&s;ton. A fortnight after, I returned, with two ladies who had lived in Bo&s;ton. In a week after my arriving at Hartford, the town of Bo&s;ton was attacked with the influenza, and the two ladies at Hartford were &s;eized at the &s;ame time. The conclu&s;ion I draw from the fact, is, that the con&s;titution of air, producing the epidemic, is &s;ome time in operation, be|fore its effects are vi&s;ible, gradually inducing a di&s;po&s;ition in the &s;y&s;tem to that di&s;ea&s;e; and as it is progre&s;&s;ive, it requires about the &s;ame time to run through its cour&s;e in one place as in another, and is not always interrupted by local cau&s;es.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t incontrovertible evidence, that infection is not the primary, controlling cau&s;e of the plague, ari&s;es from the man|ner in which that epidemic cea&s;es.</P>
<P>If infection were the principal and &s;pecific cau&s;e of its propa|gation, it mu&s;t rage forever, or as long as any of the human race &s;hould &s;urvive to receive it; for the longer the di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;ts, the more exten&s;ive mu&s;t it be. This conclu&s;ion is inevitable; for if infection &s;preads the di&s;ea&s;e &s;o rapidly, that one or two di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons diffu&s;e it in a few weeks over a city, the &s;ame principle mu&s;t, in a given time, extend it over the whole earth, unle&s;s its operation &s;hould be arre&s;ted by a &s;uperior cau&s;e. And as one di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on is &s;uppo&s;ed to infect more than one healthy per|&s;on, its progre&s;s mu&s;t be accelerated, in a duplicate, triplicate and quadruplicate ratio to its di&s;tance from its &s;ource. Its ve|locity al&s;o mu&s;t be increa&s;ed, not only by numbers in a crouded city, but by an augmented virulence, until all the inhabitants &s;hould be de&s;troyed. But all this is contrary to fact.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t plagues are modified and regulated by the &s;ea&s;ons; but the ce&s;&s;ation of pe&s;tilence in different countries, is in different &s;ea&s;ons, and &s;eems to depend on oppo&s;ite principles. In Egypt, a warm country, never reached by what may be called <HI>cold,</HI> the
<PB N="178" REF="036687_0533_100AA4E5DB82F800">
plague begins in winter, as in December, January or February; after the Nile has &s;ub&s;ided within its banks, leaving exten&s;ive plains and numerous canals, expo&s;ed to a hot &s;un; with a &s;limy &s;urface and &s;tagnant water in abundance, on the face of the country. During this period al&s;o blow the &s;outherly and &s;uffo|cating winds, hot and du&s;ty, from &s;andy de&s;arts, which may augment the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the di&s;ea&s;e cea&s;es in June, when the Nile overflows its banks, &s;preading fre&s;h water over the face of the country; at which time al&s;o begin to blow the cool refre&s;hing ely&s;ian breezes from the north or Mediterranean &s;ea.</P>
<P>Hence it is obvious that the exi&s;tence of the di&s;ea&s;e depends on the general &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere; for the inundation of the Nile certainly does not wa&s;h away the infection from the hou&s;es and clothes of the &s;ick. On the other hand, the plague cea&s;es, when the infection is mo&s;t general, and this is true in every in&s;tance.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that the plague ari&s;es from putrid exhalations in Egypt, and the rea&s;on why it cea&s;es, on the ri&s;ing of the Nile, is, that the expan&s;ion of fre&s;h water over the country and a pure northerly air, de&s;troy the&s;e exhalations.</P>
<P>In this ob&s;ervation there is truth; and it would account for the origin and the ce&s;&s;ation of the plague, if it was an annual di&s;ea&s;e, regularly influenced and entirely governed by the &s;ea|&s;ons. But here again we are overthrown; for in mo&s;t years, putrid exhalations, which always exi&s;t at a certain &s;ea&s;on, do <HI>not</HI> produce the di&s;ea&s;e. Thus we are driven to &s;eek another cau&s;e, which is <HI>not</HI> influenced by &s;ea&s;ons; and to &s;uppo&s;e its <HI>co-operation</HI> with hot winds and &s;tagnant waters in the generation of the di&s;ea&s;e. This is mo&s;t indubitably the fact.</P>
<P>Again, the plague in Syria, farther north, where &s;ome win|ter's cold is experienced, begins in &s;pring, as in February or March, and ends in June and July, during the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive heat of the &s;ummer. This is the fact, from Aleppo to Jeru&s;a|lem, and has been, from the earlie&s;t records extant.</P>
<P>Here then different cau&s;es, extreme heat and drouth, &s;eem to control the rage of the plague. But does heat de&s;troy infection? Never, unle&s;s by combu&s;tion. No degree of heat that is ever
<PB N="179" REF="036687_0534_100AA4E7709F9608">
felt in the tropical regions, or in America, has ever mitigated the force of infection, but always has increa&s;ed it. Now we know, that the heat of Syria, never exceeds in degree what is annually experienced in the We&s;t-Indies and the United States, to the 42d degree of latitude certainly, and probably to the 44th. In one re&s;pect Syria differs from this country; the &s;ummers are longer than in the northern &s;tates of America, and the climate &s;ubject to drouth. But it cannot be the duration of the heat which de&s;troys the plague; for that di&s;ea&s;e cea&s;es at the very be|ginning of &s;ummer. It abates in June, and rarely appears, to any extent, as late as Augu&s;t. Nor can we concieve why drouth in Syria &s;hould put an end to the epidemic for in mo&s;t <HI>other</HI> countries, it has not that effect. In Europe and America, ex|treme drouth has very often inflamed its violence.</P>
<P>In this in&s;tance then we find no cau&s;e for the ce&s;&s;ation of the plague, in the weather or &s;ea&s;ons, which we are able to compre|hend. We know the uniformity of the fact; and all beyond this, is conjecture. Infection can have no concern in the effect; unle&s;s on &s;ome principle hitherto unknown, cool weather generates it and heat de&s;troys it, contrary to facts in all other countries.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that the plague at Aleppo, Dama&s;cus, Said, Je|ru&s;alem, Latakia, and on all the Syrian coa&s;t, cea&s;es in ex|treme hot weather, and when the infection is in its utmo&s;t extent and violence.</P>
<P>In Italy, Con&s;tantinople, in all Europe and the temperate lat|itudes of America, ordinary plagues yield to cold; that is, they cea&s;e as epidemics of that form; but the general cau&s;e never fails to &s;how its influence, in giving to the di&s;orders of winter, &s;ome of the general &s;ymptoms which characterize the epidemic of the &s;ummer. This proves that, in common pe&s;tilence, morbid ex|halations <HI>aid</HI> the atmo&s;pheric cau&s;e in producing the epidemic; and that it is not &s;pecific contagion which contributes to &s;pread the di&s;ea&s;e, for this is not influenced by cold; but it is morbid exhalations, that yield to cold. Hence, in northern climates, cold &s;u&s;pends the action of the two &s;ubordinate cau&s;es of pe&s;tilence, morbid exhalations and infection; and this is u&s;ually &s;ufficient to check the epidemic.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="036687_0535_100AA4E9EA81F540">But that the great primary cau&s;e, is not affected or rather &s;ub|dued by cold, is apparent from the&s;e facts; that altho the plague, in its peculiar autumnal form, is &s;u&s;pended, yet the di&s;ea&s;es of winter, as pleuri&s;y and peripneumony, wear the &s;ame character; which can be occa&s;ioned only by the continued action of the &s;ame cau&s;e. Further, &s;ome plagues have not yielded to cold, as I have before ob&s;erved. Several in&s;tances have occurred, in which the di&s;ea&s;e has run through all the &s;ea&s;ons without interruption or abatement. This fact demon&s;trates that the primary cau&s;e, ex|i&s;ting in the e&s;&s;ential properties of the elements, may be of vari|ous degrees of force, and at times does actually ari&s;e to a degree, capable of producing and continuing that di&s;order, not only with|out the aid of morbid exhalations and infection, but in defiance of cold.</P>
<P>In conformity with this idea, is the fact that a pe&s;tilence which begins the earlie&s;t in the &s;ea&s;on, is the mo&s;t mortal. This is a|greed by P. Alpinus, Van Swieten and Sydenham, "Minus &s;aeva e&s;t, quo tardius illuc acce&s;&s;it, viderique incepit; ita ut quo tardius venerit, e&oacute; mitior ac brevior &s;it judicanda," &s;ays Alpi|nus, Rerum Egypt, Vol. 3. 70. The rea&s;on of which is, that in proportion to the &s;trength of the elemental cau&s;e, it begins to exhibit its effects early in the &s;ea&s;on; that is, with the <HI>lea&s;t aid</HI> from heat, noxious effluvia or other local cau&s;es.&mdash;If the general contagion of the atmo&s;phere is very powerful, its effects may ap|pear even in winter, in oppo&s;ition to cold; hence the ju&s;tne&s;s of Diemerbroeck's remark, that pe&s;tilence beginning in winter, is the mo&s;t fatal. If, on the contrary, the general con&s;titution of the air is le&s;s ho&s;tile to life and health, it will not produce an epi|demic pe&s;tilence, till it is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by great heat and local vitiation of the air; therefore the di&s;ea&s;e will not appear, till late in the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Something like this, on a &s;mall &s;cale, has characterized the different epidemics in Philadelphia. In 1793, the precur&s;ors of the epidemic were light, and the fir&s;t ca&s;es did not appear, till the la&s;t of July or beginning of Augu&s;t. In 1797 and 98, the fir&s;t ca&s;es occurred in June, and the di&s;ea&s;e in the latter years, was marked with by far the mo&s;t malignant &s;ymptoms, altho the
<PB N="181" REF="036687_0536_100AA4EC5710F7E0">
timely evacuation of the city prevented bills of mortality equal to that of 1793.</P>
<P>In New-York, this circum&s;tance, it is believed, has been le&s;s noticeable; but it may be remarked, that in the years of the epi|demic, the fir&s;t ca&s;es occurred in the la&s;t week in July, and in years, when a few &s;poradic ca&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The advocates of the &s;pecific contagion of the plague do not ad|mit that the true plague ever appears in &s;poradic ca&s;es. They think, if it once appears, its contagion mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity, &s;pread it. This is all a whim. I believe, with Dr. Mitchell, that any di&s;ea&s;e of the wor&s;t type, may be generated in the body, &s;olely by a derangement of the functions of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, and the poi&s;onous air extricated from food. But that &s;poradic ca&s;es of plague may occur and do occur very often, I have not the lea&s;t doubt. During the late war, in 1776 or 1777, two brothers by the name of &mdash; arrived from the army at Greenwich in Connecticut&mdash;one had a malignant fever, with glandular tumors; the other was his nur&s;e and in good health. The &s;ick man di|ed &s;oon after he arrived, and in le&s;s than 24 hours, his brother was al&s;o in his grave. This was true plague; but no other attendant was in|fected.&mdash;</NOTE> only have appeared, they have not occurred till many weeks later. Be&s;ides, it is very obvious that the di&s;ea&s;es of 1795 and 6, if not of 1797, were powerfully influenced, in their commencement, by local cau&s;es; as great ma&s;&s;es of putrid matter, in the parts of the city, where the fir&s;t ca&s;es occurred, and where the epidemic exhau&s;ted its principal force.&mdash;</P>
<P>In general, it may be ob&s;erved in our climate, that if a malig|nant fever does not appear, in a city, till late in Augu&s;t, the cit|izens need not apprehend very general de&s;olation. If ca&s;es occur early, as in June, there is &s;erious ground for apprehen&s;ions of danger. The only exception to the&s;e remarks, is, when the &s;ea|&s;ons &s;uffer &s;ome great, unu&s;ual and &s;udden vici&s;&s;itudes, which, du|ring a pe&s;tilential period, may overwhelm a city with almo&s;t in|&s;tantaneous calamity.&mdash;Such may be a &s;udden inva&s;ion of heat in Augu&s;t, after preceding cool weather.</P>
<P>In general it is a ju&s;t remark, that as the force of the pe&s;tilential principle, is of various degrees, in different periods, &s;o when it is mo&s;t powerful, it attacks men the earlie&s;t in the proper &s;ea&s;on, and is de&s;tined to be the mo&s;t de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>The preceding facts and conclu&s;ions &s;eem &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h the great point, that neither contagion nor infection has ever had much influence in originating or propagating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;tilential epidemic di&s;ea&s;es of the autumnal kind.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="036687_0537_100AA4EF62D0E720">But objections remain to be an&s;wered. It is alleged that the plague begins in maratime places and thence &s;preads into the coun|try adjacent. Thus it is a&s;&s;erted by the college of phy&s;icians in Philadelphia, that the pe&s;tilential fever in America "commen|ces invariably in our &s;ea-ports, while inland towns, equally expo|&s;ed to the ordinary cau&s;es of fever, e&s;cape." Memorial, dated Dec. 5, 1797.</P>
<P>Pliny, a great ob&s;erver of facts in the natural world, goes far|ther and a&s;&s;erts, "That pe&s;tilence is ob&s;erved always to proceed from &s;outhern regions towards the &s;itting &s;un; nor does it &s;carce|ly ever happen otherwi&s;e, except in winter."</P>
<BIBL>Lib. 7. Cap. 50.</BIBL>
<P>Mead and the author of Trait&eacute; de la pe&s;te have cited this opin|ion with approbation. By the words of Pliny "a meridionis partibus, ad occa&s;um &s;olis," mu&s;t mean from Egypt and the Bar|bary coa&s;t, towards Italy, Gaul and the other we&s;tern parts of Europe.</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts, is inferred a &s;trong argument in favor of the propagation of that di&s;ea&s;e by contagion.</P>
<P>With deference to the&s;e great authorities, not one of the&s;e a&s;|&s;ertions is accurate. That the plague generally appears fir&s;t in &s;ea-ports, is a ju&s;t remark, and according to the laws of nature, it mu&s;t be &s;o, without infection. But to this rule there are many exceptions. The general plague in the days of Thucydides origina|ted in Ethiopia, near the borders of upper Egypt, <HI>not a &s;ea-port.</HI></P>
<P>The violent plague in 252 began in the &s;ame region; as did that of 1736.</P>
<P>The plague of 542 began in Lower Egypt, between Pelu&s;ium and a mora&s;s, called the Serbonian bog, at a di&s;tance from the port of Pelu&s;ium. It &s;hould have been mentioned that the mor|tal plague in the reign of the Antonines began in Seleucia, on the Tigris, far from the &s;ea. The black pe&s;tilence of 1348 origin|ated in China. That of 1450 in &s;ome parts of A&s;ia. The pe&s;ti|lence of 1348 began, when it fir&s;t appeared in France, in A|vignon, <HI>not</HI> a &s;ea-port; as did that of 1482. The plague of 1575 in Italy, began at the northward, in Trent, and proceeded &s;outhward, contrary to the a&s;&s;ertion of Pliny; and every one

sknow Trent is not a maritime place. The plague in Holland in 1663, began in Heu&s;den, <HI>not</HI> a &s;ea-port, but on a river and near a mora&s;s. In 1702, a plague broke out in Poland, far from the &s;ea.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the United States, the a&s;&s;ertion of the College of Phy&s;icians mu&s;t &s;tand or fall, according to the definition of the fevers which have appeared in the country. If no pe&s;tilence has ever appeared, except in &s;ea-ports, we mu&s;t affix &s;ome other name to the mortal epidemics that vi&s;it the interior of our coun|try. Certain it is, contrary to the &s;tatement of the College of Phy&s;icians, that the true yellow fever, and &s;o called at the time, prevailed in Albany in 1746.</P>
<P>About the mar&s;hes in the interior of our country, an epidemic bilious fever has times without number, raged as fatally, as ever it did in Philadelphia, de&s;troying life in three or four days, at|tended with all the characteri&s;tic &s;ymptoms of yellow fever and carrying off almo&s;t every per&s;on, within the region of its atmo&s;|phere. This has happened, about &s;ome of the lakes in the &s;tate of New-York, every year &s;ince the pre&s;ent pe&s;tilential period com|menced, and whole villages have been depopulated. If the Col|lege of Phy&s;icians choo&s;e not to call this di&s;ea&s;e yellow fever, I cannot help it; but &s;ure I am, if it is not that &s;pecific di&s;order, it is one equally de&s;olating, and as little entitled to be fathered on the country, as any &s;pecies of plague whatever. It is a fact al&s;o that the bodies of tho&s;e who peri&s;h by that fever near rivers and lakes, are, if po&s;&s;ible, more yellow than in cities.</P>
<P>But what utterly di&s;proves the a&s;&s;ertion of the College of Phy|&s;icians, is, that the &s;ame pe&s;tilential di&s;temper which has lately afflicted our cities, appeared among the aborigines of this coun|try, before it was &s;ettled by the Engli&s;h, before the We&s;t-Indies were &s;ettled by the Engli&s;h or French, and before a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el from the i&s;lands had ever reached our &s;hores. To confirm this fact, it is well known that the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e has often vi&s;ited them, &s;ince the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements, and in &s;ituations and under circum|&s;tances, when it was not po&s;&s;ible for them to receive it from infec|tion, as at Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard in 1763, and &s;eve|ral times, in the limits of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Rhode-I&s;land.

The Onandagoes in the &s;tate of New-York, three or four hun|dred miles from a &s;ea-port, about eighty years ago, were attacked with pe&s;tilence, which wa&s;ted the tribe; and the place where their village was then built, has, on the account of that mortality, been ever &s;ince abandoned, and is now overgrown with trees. The &s;ame happened among the Senecas at a later period.</P>
<P>What the di&s;ea&s;e among the Onondagoes was, I am not inform|ed; it might have been the &s;mall-pox; but the country where it happened, is now &s;ubject to mortal bilious epidemics, which kill in three days, and turn the body as yellow as &s;affron.

The di&s;ea&s;e was fatal to almo&s;t all who were affected; but it was local, and in|fectious, for a law was pa&s;&s;ed that no per&s;on &s;hould go from one &s;ide of the river to the other, and the Indians on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide remained in health.

<P>About twenty-&s;ix years ago, a malignant bilious fever attack|ed the Indians, at Quidne&s;it neck, in North-King&s;ton, in the &s;ame &s;tate, and mo&s;t who were &s;eized, peri&s;hed. It attacked al&s;o a few families of whites, but with le&s;s mortality. North-King&s;ton is a &s;ea-port, but there is no &s;ugge&s;tion of foreign origin.</P>

<P>From the&s;e facts let the public judge how little reliance can be placed on general a&s;&s;ertions even of learned and re&s;pectable &s;oci|eties, when made without a critical examination of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It is proper that I &s;hould here take notice of an a&s;&s;ertion, found in a number of authors. "That Thucydides relates the plague, in his days, to have &s;pread from Ethiopia by means of contagion, infection or fomites." The learned Diemerbroeck has fallen into this mi&s;take. p. 48.</P>
<P>Galen is more correct, when he &s;ays, that pe&s;tilence &s;pread by the corruption or infection of the air. This idea, tho not
<PB N="185" REF="036687_0540_100AA4F70FBAA450">
the expe&s;&s;ion, is accurate. The truth is, Thucydides does not &s;ay, the di&s;temper &s;pread by infection or contagion. A literal tran&s;lation from the Greek is as follows. "It began as it is re|ported, fir&s;t from Ethiopia, above Egypt; then it fell on Egypt and Lybia, and a great part of the King's dominions (Per&s;ia.) It then &s;uddenly invaded the city of Athens and fir&s;t the Pieraeus." In the paragraph preceding he &s;ays, the di&s;ea&s;e had prevailed in many regions fir&s;t and e&s;pecially at Lemnos; but does not hint at infection or contagion as the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation of Pliny, that pe&s;tilence originates in &s;outh|ern climates and proceeds northward and we&s;tward, is generally, but not always true. Alexander Ru&s;&s;el tells us, the pe&s;tilence in Aleppo in 1719 came from the northward; and many au|thors relate that it appears in Con&s;tantinople or Smyrna, before it does in Egypt. This may be partly owing to alterations in the Turki&s;h cities, &s;ince Pliny's time.</P>
<P>But on ju&s;t principles, the fact is rationally explained. If a particular &s;tate of air, favorable to the propagation of that di&s;|temper, mu&s;t exi&s;t, before it can become epidemic, which is ad|mitted by the friends and foes of contagion, then &s;uppo&s;ing this <HI>general</HI> pe&s;tilential principle to exi&s;t, at a given time, in equal force, all over the earth, or any portion of it; it mu&s;t follow inevitably, that this general cau&s;e will produce the wor&s;t di&s;ea&s;es <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in climates and &s;ituations, where the mo&s;t powerful <HI>local</HI> cau&s;es exi&s;t, as heat, moi&s;ture, and all kinds of deleterious exhalations. And for a mo&s;t obvious rea&s;on; the debility of the human body mu&s;t be fir&s;t induced in tho&s;e &s;ituations.</P>
<P>This is a complete &s;olution of the fact mentioned by Pliny; and he him&s;elf ju&s;tifies this explanation of it, for he excepts from his own general rule, the pe&s;tilence that appears in winter, a circum&s;tance pa&s;&s;ed over by Mead. Now the rea&s;on why a plague beginning in winter does not follow the cour&s;e of one be|ginning in &s;ummer, but appears &s;ometimes in northern climates <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> is, that &s;uch a pe&s;tilence does not require the aid of con|tingent cau&s;es, as noxious exhalations. It is independent of <HI>lo|cal cau&s;es,</HI> and induced &s;olely by the e&s;&s;ential qualities of the at|mo&s;phere; it may therefore appear fir&s;t in any place or climate
<PB N="186" REF="036687_0541_100AA4F8960C7478">
whatever, according to that &s;tate of air. This happens only in great plagues which &s;eldom occur.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations apply al&s;o to the objection that pe&s;tilence fir&s;t appears in maritime places, as mentioned by Procopius, and others.</P>
<P>It is a fact known to every medical man that humidity is a cau&s;e of debility. Hear what the learned Zimmerman &s;ays on this point.</P>
<BIBL>On Phy&s;ic, vol. 2. p. 100.</BIBL>
<P>"The humidity of air weakens a man &s;uddenly; it relaxes the &s;olids, and of cour&s;e weakens the circulation, &s;o that the &s;e|cretions are carried on with difficulty. The in&s;en&s;ible per&s;pira|tion is checked, the moi&s;ture pa&s;&s;es in through the ab&s;orbing pores of the &s;kin, and the patient feels a la&s;&s;itude and heavine&s;s, which deprive him of all his gaiety, and render the mind as oppre&s;&s;ed as the body"&mdash;"Damp &s;ituations are, in every country, un|healthy."</P>
<BIBL>p. 102.</BIBL>
<P>There is not a per&s;on living who cannot te&s;tify to the truth of the&s;e remarks. Hence the languor which depre&s;&s;es man, in a hot &s;ultry day, with a &s;outherly light air, <HI>loaded with vapor.</HI> Hence this &s;tate of the air, when of long continuance, never fails to generate epidemic di&s;orders; and if it occurs, during a pe&s;tilential con&s;titution, mankind &s;eldom e&s;cape the ravages of the plague.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid that the inhabitants of maritime towns, are le&s;s expo&s;ed to this &s;ource of debility, than &s;eamen, who are in general remarkably healthy. To which I an&s;wer, that the or|dinary moi&s;ture from &s;ea air never of it&s;elf produces di&s;ea&s;es; and at &s;ea, there exi&s;ts no exciting cau&s;e, as morbid exhalations, unle&s;s in &s;hips of war and crouded tran&s;ports, in which di&s;ea&s;es often proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed from human effluvia. But I que&s;tion whether the bodies of &s;eamen po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame firm texture as tho&s;e of laboring far|mers in the country. Certain it is, that &s;eamen are in general not &s;o long-lived men, as farmers. This is a&s;cribed to their ir|regular and &s;evere fatigue; but I &s;u&s;pect it more owing to the in|ce&s;&s;ant operation of the debilitating powers of moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>Whatev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r may be in this, it is certain that moi&s;ture of <HI>it&s;elf</HI> in|duces

debility, in a greater or le&s;s degree, tho not di&s;ea&s;e; but when its action on the &s;y&s;tem is combined with the operation of morbid exhalations, which abound in cities, e&s;pecially near navi|gable water, together with the frequent alternations of heat and cold, occa&s;ioned by the contiguity of land and water; we are not to be &s;urpri&s;ed that cities on the borders of the ocean, and the banks of rivers, are the fir&s;t to be attacked with pe&s;tilence. We might, without the aid of facts, prove a priori, that this mu&s;t generally be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Hodges mentions that the London plague of 1665 &s;pread into the adjacent country, <HI>e&s;pecially along the Thames;</HI> but he takes care to a&s;cribe this to infected goods, and not to humidity&mdash;a|nother proof of the mi&s;chiefs of theory.</P>
<P>Indeed the circum&s;tance that next to large maritime cities, the towns &s;ituated on the borders of rivers or lakes, are the mo&s;t &s;e|verely harra&s;&s;ed with epidemics of a fatal kind, e&s;pecially autum|nal di&s;ea&s;es, is an evidence of the truth of the &s;ame principle. Wherever we turn our eyes, we &s;ee autumnal di&s;ea&s;es, from &s;im|ple tertians to the plague, mo&s;t frequent and mo&s;t deadly, in low &s;ituations, under the combined operation of heat, moi&s;ture and different &s;pecies of noxious exhalations. It is therefore as un|philo&s;ophical to deduce, from this fact, arguments in favor of the foreign origin of the plague, as in favor of the importation of many other malignant di&s;ea&s;es; for the &s;ame phenomena attend them all&mdash;they all appear <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and are mo&s;t epidemic and fatal, in the vicinity of water. This is their general rule, to which exi&s;t &s;ome exceptions, as well in regard to the plague, as to other bilious complaints.</P>
<P>But the di&s;covery of a general pe&s;tilential principle, extend|ing over a whole hemi&s;phere, or the whole globe nearly at the &s;ame time, or with a rapid progre&s;&s;ion, &s;olves all the difficulties on this &s;ubject. Had Pliny known, that at the moment a &s;evere plague appears in Egypt, the di&s;ea&s;es of all Europe, or all the world, a&s;&s;ume unu&s;ual malignancy, or other contagious and in|fectious epidemics appear, in every quarter, to the di&s;tance of a thou&s;and leagues, his remark would have been equally ju&s;t, as to the origin and progre&s;s of the plague, but it would have opened to him new cau&s;es of its origin, and a more ju&s;t and philo&s;oph|ical
<PB N="188" REF="036687_0543_100AA4FC9A9D6E48">
view of the phenomenon. This is a di&s;covery which pro&s;|trates all theories of &s;pecific <HI>contagion,</HI> and reduces the influence of <HI>infection</HI> to its ju&s;t mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Another fact. Fore&s;tus has declared that in pe&s;tilence, three times the number died in wet weather, as in fair and dry weath|er; the infection being le&s;s ea&s;ily di&s;per&s;ed, in wet weather, which is evident from the &s;moke of chimnies.</P>
<BIBL>Van Swieten, vol. 16. 26.</BIBL>
<P>It is well known in America, that while the weather is hot, rains and moi&s;t air greatly multiply ca&s;es of pe&s;tilential fever.</P>
<P>In 1720 a &s;torm of thunder and lightning at Mar&s;eilles, late in July, was followed by a great increa&s;e of the plague.</P>
<BIBL>Trait&eacute; de la pe&s;te.</BIBL>
<P>Every one knows that the air, along the borders of the ocean, corrodes iron and other metallic &s;ub&s;tances. Is it not then que&s;|tionable whether the &s;aline acid, which impregnates the maritime air, has not &s;ome deleterious effect on the human body, when combined with other vapors from the earth? Are we yet ac|quainted with the e&s;&s;ential properties of all the po&s;&s;ible combina|tions of aerial &s;ub&s;tances?</P>
<P>Again; Mead has remarked, that countries and cities which have had mo&s;t commerce with Africa, as Mar&s;eilles, have been mo&s;t frequently afflicted with the plague. A French author, he &s;ays, reckons 20 plagues that have infe&s;ted Mar&s;eilles, notwith|&s;tanding its healthy &s;ituation.</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to this, it may be proved by facts, that the cit|ies, in the interior of Germany, that never had any trade or connection with Egypt, u&s;ed formerly to be harra&s;&s;ed with that di&s;ea&s;e, nearly, if not quite as often as the maritime ports of Eng|land, France, Spain or Italy. Any man will learn this, who reads the <HI>whole</HI> hi&s;tory of that calamity, in&s;tead of that of a few detached in&s;tances.</P>
<P>As to the twenty plagues of Mar&s;eilles, a&s;cribed to the trade with Egypt, I would ob&s;erve, that I can produce the hi&s;tory of near double that number of violent plagues in London, <HI>before</HI> that city had any trade or connection with Egypt.</P>
<P>Equally ill founded is the idea of medical writers that the yel|low fever of the We&s;t-Indies was brought fir&s;t from Siam. "Mal|adie
<PB N="189" REF="036687_0544_100AA4FF35877DC0">
de Siam," is the name given to it by French phy&s;icians; and this improper name, will &s;erve to perpetuate the error, while it &s;hall exi&s;t as a monument of ignorance and fal&s;e philo&s;ophy. This pretended Siam fever was the pe&s;tilence of the Indians, on this continent, before the We&s;t-India I&s;lands were &s;ettled by the French or Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Another extraordinary a&s;&s;ertion of Mead, is, that "the north|ern nations of Europe, before their connection with Africa in trade, grew populous more rapidly, than in modern times."</P>
<P>I will not conte&s;t the a&s;&s;ertion, as it regards the degree of pop|ulation of tho&s;e countries, in different periods. Authors differ in opinion on the &s;ubject of the ancient population of Europe, and no certain documents or facts exi&s;t by which the point can be a&s;certained.</P>
<P>But the implication nece&s;&s;arily deduced from Mead's a&s;&s;ertion, is, that the plague is more frequent and de&s;tructive in the north of Europe, &s;ince a trade has been opened with Egypt, than be|fore; for on this principle only would he account for the redu|ced population of modern times. If this is what he meant to in&s;inuate, the a&s;&s;ertion is not &s;imply inaccurate, but ab&s;olutely fal&s;e. From the fir&s;t accounts we have of Ru&s;&s;ia, Poland and the Baltic regions, to the fir&s;t opening of a trade with Egypt, in modern days, plagues were much <HI>more frequent</HI> and fatal in tho&s;e countries than they have been, within the la&s;t century, &s;ince a con|&s;tant trade has been carried on with Egypt and every part of the Levant. For the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, I appeal to facts.&mdash; In the year 1485, the Engli&s;h fir&s;t opened a trade to the Medi|terranean, e&s;pecially with Italy, and a con&s;ul was appointed, re|&s;ident at Pi&s;a. The act of appointment by Richard 3d. con|tains this pa&s;&s;age "whereas certain merchants and others, from England, <HI>intend</HI> to frequent foreign parts, and chiefly Italy, with their &s;hips and merchandize"&mdash;Before this, England had little or no trade, <HI>directly</HI> with foreign countries. All her trade was con|ducted by Lombards, Genoe&s;e, Venetians and the Han&s;em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rch|ants. There was no direct trade to Egypt and the Levant.</P>
<P>About the year 1511, Engli&s;h &s;hips began to frequent Sicily, Candia, Chios and the Syrian coa&s;t; but this was accounted a
<PB N="190" REF="036687_0545_100AA50242F4AEF0">
very hazardous voyage, and &s;hips &s;eldom made it in le&s;s than a year.</P>
<P>In 1535 Engli&s;h factors fir&s;t &s;ettled in tho&s;e countries.</P>
<BIBL>See Ander&s;on's Commerce, vol. 1. 683. vol. 2. 79. Rymer's Federa, vol. 12. 261, and Hackluite Voyages, vol. 2. 96.</BIBL>
<P>Now, the fact is, that the plague was as frequent and &s;evere in England, Denmark, Sweden and Germany, in the tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries, before any foreign trade exi&s;ted, as in any later period. Not to mention the uni|ver&s;al plague in the days of Vortigern, about 448, which never has been exceeded in extent and violence, unle&s;s by the black pe&s;tilence of 1348.</P>
<P>The Levant Company was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed by Queen Eliza|beth in 1581, and the act of incorporation expre&s;sly &s;tates that "Sir Edward O&s;born and his a&s;&s;ociates, the per&s;ons incorpora|ted, had at their own great co&s;ts and charges, <HI>found out and opened</HI> a trade to Turkey." Before that time the commodities of Egypt, Syria and Turkey were all imported from Italy, &s;o Venetian or Genoe&s;e &s;hips.</P>
<P>The commerce of the North of Europe from the year 1200 to 1500, was almo&s;t wholly in the hands of the Han&s;ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ic Con|federacy; but on careful inve&s;tigation, I cannot find the lea&s;t trace of a direct trade to the Levant, by the towns in that league. Indeed before the di&s;covery of the mariner's compa&s;s, in the 14th century, all trade was carried on by coa&s;ting. Hi&s;|tory records more than one hundred general plagues before that di&s;covery. So totally fal&s;e is the a&s;&s;ertion of Mead.</P>
<P>But &s;ay the College of Phy&s;icians, in the memorial before cited, "proper health laws, &s;trictly enforced, have latterly pro|tected the commercial parts of Europe from its ravages." This is a point of importance, and while the a&s;&s;ertion &s;tands un&s;up|ported by proofs, I am at liberty to deny the truth of it, and there leave the que&s;tion, as fair on one &s;ide as the other; for I cannot prove a negative. If however health laws have produ|ced the effect alleged, it is very &s;trange that the plague did not di&s;appear at a much earlier period.</P>
<P>The in&s;titution of health laws was as early as 1484, and it appears they were fir&s;t introduced at Venice. If the&s;e laws have
<PB N="191" REF="036687_0546_100A89D90C9D4750">
ever prevented an epidemic plague, it is very &s;trange, that they were ineffectual in Venice and other parts of Italy, for near two hundred years, as they certainly were. It is indeed wonderful that, during the 16th century when all Europe was almo&s;t con|tinually ravaged by that di&s;ea&s;e, and down to the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century, no man could be found to devi&s;e a law, and no police, to enforce it, &s;o as to arre&s;t the progre&s;s of the plague in Italy. Yet &s;uch was the fact.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tatute, I believe, in England to re&s;train the progre&s;s of infection, was in 1604, in the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of James I. 31. The regulations attempted by the proclamation of Queen Eliza|beth in 1580, before recited, prohibiting the enlargement of London, and the re&s;idence of more families than one in the &s;ame hou&s;e, could not, from the tenor of them, be carried into effect. The &s;tatute of James limits its provi&s;ions to the con|finement of the &s;ick to their hou&s;es, a breach of which was made felony. An enforcement was attempted in the &s;ub&s;equent plagues, and e&s;pecially in 1665, but without the lea&s;t good effect, as to the city at large, and with a very ill effect upon the di&s;ea&s;ed and their families. It is certain however that a &s;trict execution of &s;uch a law, would arre&s;t the progre&s;s of <HI>infection,</HI> for the infection of the plague is found and admitted on all hands to be confined to contact or very near approach, &s;o as to be received by the breath of the di&s;ea&s;ed. If therefore the di&s;ea&s;e were propagated by infection only, &s;uch confinement of the &s;ick would check its progre&s;s, if not annihilate it. We know by repeated experience in America, that there is not the lea&s;t difficulty in putting an end to a di&s;ea&s;e ari&s;ing &s;olely from &s;pecific contagion; and it has often been done in ca&s;es of the &s;mall-pox. Hence the inefficacy of the law of James I. after repeated trials in the plague, is a &s;trong evidence that its propagation depends on &s;ome other cau&s;e than infection.</P>
<P>From 1604, to the reign of Queen Anne, no general laws were enacted on this &s;ubject, as far as I can di&s;cover from the printed &s;tatutes. In the 9th year of Queen Anne, 1709, pa&s;|&s;ed the fir&s;t &s;tatute enjoining ve&s;&s;els to perform quarantine; at lea&s;t I can find none earlier. This was repeated by 26th.

George 2, 1752, a new &s;tatute on the &s;ubject, which was after|wards amended by the 29th of the &s;ame reign. Now it &s;o hap|pens, that the plague cea&s;ed in London in 1666, forty-three years <HI>before</HI> a general quarantine was in&s;tituted. Particular laws had been pa&s;&s;ed before, on emergencies, as in 1664, when all importation of goods from Holland, was prohibited, on account of the plague, then in Holland; but without effect. The truth then, is, &s;o far as regards Great-Britain, now the mo&s;t commer|cial country on earth, and at the time in que&s;tion, the mo&s;t com|mercial, next to Holland, the plague entirely cea&s;ed and di&s;ap|peared, 43 years before the exi&s;tence of quarantine laws. If any mi&s;take occurs in this &s;tatement, it mu&s;t proceed from want of materials&mdash;my enquiries are limited to Black&s;tone and the printed &s;tatutes at large, the only documents I po&s;&s;e&s;s on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of my reading, I have found but two or three in&s;tances, in which it has ever been <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> that health laws have pre&s;erved a city from pe&s;tilence. Mead mentions two in&s;tances; one at Ferrara in 1630, where every per&s;on, &s;eized with the di&s;|order, was immediately removed to a Lazaretto; which being done in &s;even or eight in&s;tances, the di&s;ea&s;e was checked and di&s;|appeared.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance he mentions was at Rome in 1657, where the per&s;ons fir&s;t &s;eized were removed to Lazarettos and their fam|ilies to ho&s;pitals without the city, and the city was &s;oon freed from the di&s;order. He &s;uppo&s;es further that the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;u&s;|pended a whole fortnight in Mar&s;eilles, in 1720, by the &s;ame means.</P>
<P>I have no account before me of the origin and progre&s;s of the plague, in Italy, 1630 and 1657, except the &s;ketches found in Mead's works, but wherever I can obtain a correct account of this di&s;ea&s;e, mentioned al&s;o by Mead, I find his &s;tatements are imperfect and erroneous; I therefore place very little dependence on them. That the plague in Mar&s;eilles was &s;topped a fortnight by regulations of policy, is not true. The di&s;ea&s;e appeared in the preceding autumn, and was &s;u&s;pended five or &s;ix months by the winter. When it appeared in the month of May 1720, wri|ters
<PB N="193" REF="036687_0548_100AA508C18E1DF8">
&s;ay, the fir&s;t ca&s;es were among tho&s;e who had intercour&s;e with the &s;hip and goods from Said; but all tho&s;e goods were prohibited to be carried into the city, and &s;ubjected to fifteen days retreat and purification. The porters who had concern with them were confined. Some weeks after, in the month of June, ca&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e appeared in the city; all precautions had proved fruitle&s;s; as the hot weather came on, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;tarted up here and there in the city, among per&s;ons who never had any concern with the &s;hip or the goods, or the infected; it then &s;ub&s;ided; then again appeared, in the manner before related.</P>
<P>Whether the per&s;ons &s;eized in May contracted the di&s;ea&s;e from the goods or foul air of the &s;hip, or not, is not material; for the goods were clean&s;ed, and all the di&s;ea&s;ed confined to the ho&s;pital, and all the porters &s;hut out from the city. Yet when the di&s;ea&s;e appeared in the city, no per&s;on could tell how it came there; many were &s;eized who had never been near infection; and hence the populace re&s;ort to &s;uppo&s;ition to account for its or|igin &mdash;they <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> the di&s;ea&s;e had come from the goods after they were clean&s;ed, tho they had no evidence of it. Be&s;ides I have before remarked under the year 1720, that the goods could not be infected, for it is admitted on all hands that they were &s;hip|ped at Said, when the di&s;ea&s;e was <HI>not</HI> in that port. The &s;hip's hold might have generated foul air on her pa&s;&s;age, and the fir&s;t per&s;ons connected with her might have contracted a pe&s;tilence from that air, which is not an uncommon thing, in &s;uch a very &s;ickly period, as that was, when mortality was increa&s;ed all over Europe and America. But the truth is, had that air been the cau&s;e of the plague in the city, the di&s;ea&s;e would not have been &s;u&s;pended for &s;ix weeks, but would have made a regular progre&s;s from one patient to another. But no; it di&s;appears for &s;ix weeks, and then breaks out in parts of the city remote from the &s;uppo|&s;ed &s;ource of infection, and among people who had not been near that &s;ource. So inaccurate and incon&s;i&s;tent appear all accounts of the contraction of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es from fomites, which I have been able to inve&s;tigate by full and authentic documents. This &s;hows how little reliance we can place on partial &s;tate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ents, made to &s;upport favorite &s;y&s;tems. I therefore am per&s;uaded that
<PB N="194" REF="036687_0549_100AA50A47E19FB8">
the ca&s;es mentioned by Mead of the effectual re&s;traint of the plague in Italy by removing the &s;ick, are not fully &s;tated, and that an accurate enquiry would prove the &s;uppo&s;ed effect to re&s;ult from other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The following facts will furni&s;h a more rational &s;olution of the phenomenon.</P>
<P>In the United States, ever &s;ince the commencement of the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of air, that is, from 1790, &s;poradic ca&s;es of our pe&s;tilential fever have occurred, not only in cities, but in va|rious parts of the country, more or le&s;s, every &s;ummer and au|tumn. In 1792 occurred a number in New-York; al&s;o in 1794 when one ca&s;e exhibited infection; and in 1797. Of a|bout thirty ca&s;es perhaps, in each year, &s;ome of them were ex|ce&s;&s;ively violent, highly marked, and in a degree, infectious. In 1791 and in 1796, &s;everal hundred ca&s;es appeared, yet the di&s;|ea&s;e was not epidemic, but local, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of the city was not &s;u&s;pended. Now had every per&s;on, the moment of his &s;eizure, been conveyed out of the city to a ho&s;pital, the e&s;cape of the city, in each of the&s;e years, would vulgarly have been a&s;cribed to that circum&s;tance. This was doubtle&s;s the ca&s;e in Ferrara and Rome, and this is unque&s;tionably the &s;olution of the fact, that the ca&s;es in the Italian cities, were &s;poradic ca&s;es, which always occur in the neighborhood of the plague. This di&s;ea&s;e, in the years mentioned, raged in other parts of Italy; the ca&s;es men|tioned by Mead were &s;poradic ca&s;es, indicating a pe&s;tilential con|&s;titution of air, extending to tho&s;e cities, but of a le&s;s malignancy, and too mild to produce a general pe&s;tilence in tho&s;e places; it affected only a few per&s;ons of habits mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of it; and to the&s;e it probably would have been limited, had none of them been removed.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar fact occurred in Philadelphia in 1794. Eighty or a hundred per&s;ons died that year of the true yellow fever; none of them were removed; but to the&s;e was limited the operation of the pe&s;tilential principles, local and general; and no epidemic en&s;ued.</P>
<P>In New-London a ca&s;e occurred in 1795; and in 1796 &s;ev|eral ca&s;es of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e; but no epidemic, altho no remo|val of the &s;ick took place.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="036687_0550_100AA50C8668A7D0">In Providence, &s;poradic ca&s;es have occurred almo&s;t every year, with &s;ymptoms of the infectious yellow fever. In 1791, in June, died two daughters of a widow, in the center of the town. They vomited bilious matter, and their bodies were yel|low, with livid and purple &s;pots. Other ca&s;es occurred the &s;ame year; one ca&s;e in 1792, and a number in 1793, 4 and 5; ca&s;es which could not po&s;&s;ibly have originated from foreign &s;our|ces. Some of them appeared to be infectious, as that of the young women fir&s;t mentioned, the fir&s;t being taken on the 4th of June and dying on the 7th; the &s;econd being &s;eized on the 9th, and dying on the twelfth. Yet no epidemic followed; and had the&s;e patients been removed to a di&s;tant ho&s;pital, the &s;afety of the town would have been a&s;cribed to that removal, and the &s;alutary effect of health laws would, by Mead's followers, have been trumpeted over the country, and what is wor&s;e, would have been recorded as an important fact, which would hereafter mi&s;lead po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Nothing is more dangerous than to build a theory, or to e&s;tab|li&s;h a general principle on a few detached facts, inaccurately &s;tated, and ill-under&s;tood.</P>
<P>With regard to the ca&s;e of Rome &s;tated by Mead, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the di&s;ea&s;e had, in the preceding year, killed 10,000 of its inhabitants, and in the kingdom of Naples 400,000. The di&s;ea&s;e had probably fini&s;hed its cour&s;e in that region, and the few ca&s;es in Rome in 1657, were only detached in&s;tances, the remains of the pe&s;tilential cau&s;e; &s;uch as occurred in London in 1666, after the fatal plague of the preceding year. It is by no means probable that the di&s;ea&s;e, if neglected, would have become epidemic.</P>
<P>But we have &s;tronger ground to oppo&s;e the idea of the Col|lege of Phy&s;icians, relative to the effect of health laws. Nu|merous examples are on record, in which the full force of the be&s;t regulations to prevent pe&s;tilence, has been applied in vain; and &s;ince the publication of the memorial of the College, from which this idea is taken, Philadelphia has witne&s;&s;ed the futility of &s;uch regulations, in two melancholy in&s;tances.</P>
<P>In 1636, the law to prevent infection was rigorou&s;ly executed in Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ick were confined, &s;u&s;pected families were &s;e|que&s;tered;
<PB N="196" REF="036687_0551_100AA5D6983C73D8">
but all to no purpo&s;e; the di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread, the legal re&s;trictions were then taken off, and no ill effect followed; the di&s;temper &s;pread no fa&s;ter than before.</P>
<P>In 1665, the &s;ame regulations were tried in vain; and &s;o was the law, prohibiting the importation of goods from Holland.</P>
<P>The approach of pe&s;tilence towards Dantzick in 1708, in which year it appeared at Thorn, alarmed the magi&s;trates of the former city, and every po&s;&s;ible precaution was u&s;ed to prevent its reaching Dantzick. Commerce and communication with in|fected and &s;u&s;pected places were forbidden; no &s;orts of merchan|dize, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which are mo&s;t apt to retain infection, were permitted to enter the city from &s;uch infected places; all &s;trangers and travellers were &s;trictly examined, and none &s;uffer|ed to enter the city, without &s;ufficient proof of coming from healthy places; all the inhabitants were cautioned not to hold corre&s;pondence with infected places, nor to harbor tho&s;e who came from them. The&s;e and other regulations were enjoined by an edict in July 1708. Yet all to no purpo&s;e; the plague appeared at Dantzick, the next &s;pring.</P>
<BIBL>Baddam's Memoirs, vol. 6. p. 6.</BIBL>
<P>This is a remarkable in&s;tance of the futility of human regu|lations, when oppo&s;ed to the laws of the phy&s;ical world. The people of Dantzick, had they been acquainted with the princi|ples of pe&s;tilence, might have fore&s;een in 1708, the probability of the inefficacy of their regulations. The &s;tate of the air in the production of millions of &s;piders, and the increa&s;ing mortal|ity in the city, indicated the exi&s;tence of a &s;tate of the air, unfriendly to health, which was increa&s;ing and only required a little more virulence to generate the evil, which they ignorantly &s;uppo&s;ed mu&s;t come in &s;ick bodies, goods or old clothes; and which they were idly combatting on that mi&s;taken principle.</P>
<P>It has already been &s;tated that the rigorous execution of health laws at Mar&s;eilles in 1720, proved utterly fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>The plague which de&s;olated Naples in 1656 was &s;aid to be introduced into that city by &s;oldiers from Sardinia, where it ra|ged the preceding year. Yet the Viceroy, Count Ca&s;trillo had prohibited all intercour&s;e with Sardinia. After the di&s;ea&s;e ap|peared which was fir&s;t in the form of a malignant fever, without
<PB N="197" REF="036687_0552_100A8A7E13E8A248">
glandular tumors, all po&s;&s;ible means were u&s;ed to prevent its &s;preading, but to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The confidence in modern health laws, is like the re&s;pect which the ancient Egyptians paid to the bird, Ibis, which, they &s;uppo&s;ed, averted the plague by de&s;troying the flying &s;erpents that the hot Lybian winds brought into the country.</P>
<BIBL>Cicero de Nat. Deor. lib. 1. 36.</BIBL>
<P>The Egyptians were like all modern nations&mdash;unwilling to believe the plague generated at home&mdash;they a&s;cribed it to infec|tion brought by flying &s;erpents, as the moderns a&s;cribe it to old clothes, bales of goods and infected &s;hips. They mi&s;took the cau&s;e, adored Ibis, as the moderns do, quarantine, and with the &s;ame ill &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>But we need not &s;tep off of our own territories to find evi|dence of the inefficacy of health laws, when oppo&s;ed to the op|eration of the laws of nature. No expedient has been left un|tried to ward off the calamity of pe&s;tilence, but without any vi&s;ible effect. The &s;everity of the affliction in Philadelphia, in former years, had rendered the magi&s;tracy of the city extremely careful to guard again&s;t importation in 1798. The mo&s;t rigid qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">antine was exacted&mdash;ventilators of the be&s;t con&s;truction em|ployed &mdash;the ve&s;&s;els were wa&s;hed, fumigated, white-wa&s;hed with lime, and every practicable mode of purification adopted. Not a ve&s;&s;el was &s;uffered to approach the city, without &s;atisfactory evidence of the healthy &s;tate of the people, and the &s;alubrity of the ve&s;&s;el and cargo. See the letter from Hillary Baker, E&s;q. mayor of the city, to the mayor of Baltimore, dated Augu&s;t 13th, 1798. Alas! all to no purpo&s;e! The ravages of the di&s;ea&s;e are well known.</P>
<P>If, &s;ays the late worthy mayor, the di&s;ea&s;e has eluded the health officers, I &s;hall de&s;pair of future &s;ucce&s;s, unle&s;s the We&s;t-India commerce &s;hall be prohibited in the &s;ummer months, and magazines e&s;tabli&s;hed below for receiving the cargoes.</P>
<P>Similar provi&s;ions in other ports have been e&s;tabli&s;hed with no better &s;ucce&s;s. The health laws at New-York, &s;o far as appears, were as well executed in 1795, 96 and 98, when the fever was epidemic, as in 1794 and 97 when it was <HI>not.</HI> No vi&s;ible good effects are to be di&s;covered in guarding again&s;t an epidemic; the
<PB N="198" REF="036687_0553_100A89EB44738AA8">
utility of clean&s;ing ve&s;&s;els therefore is limited to guarding again&s;t the operation of infection, upon a few per&s;ons who may enter them, with foul air on board. Public health, &s;o far as can be di&s;covered, has never been &s;ecured by tho&s;e regulations. What &s;eems to place this point beyond que&s;tion is, that for thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> years preceding 1792, no pe&s;tilential fever ever &s;pread in America, from the ten thou&s;and infected &s;eamen and pa&s;&s;engers, which ar|rived in the country from the We&s;t-Indies, and during which time, in mo&s;t places, not the lea&s;t precaution was ever u&s;ed to guard again&s;t it; yet &s;ince 1792, that is, under a &s;tate of air, generating various epidemics, the pe&s;tilential fever has appeared in &s;poradic ca&s;es, every year and in almo&s;t every town in Amer|ica, and has raged as an epidemic in mo&s;t of our large towns, in oppo&s;ition to the utmo&s;t efforts of human &s;kill. I am per&s;uaded, the conclu&s;ions from the&s;e facts amount to demon&s;trative evidence, that infection is <HI>not</HI> the principal, or cau&s;e &s;ine qua non, of this terrible calamity.</P>
<P>The application of quarantine laws to our epidemic pe&s;tilential fever, is ju&s;t as u&s;ele&s;s, as the order of the Sultan, Achmet I. in the wa&s;ting plague of 1613, for tran&s;porting all the cats in Con&s;tantinople to the i&s;land of Scutari. The Jewi&s;h phy&s;icians told the Emperor, that the plague was occa&s;ioned by the cats, and the poor cats were di&s;patched into exile. Yet this did not re&s;train the plague.</P>
<P>People have been forever mi&s;taking the cau&s;e of the plague. In the fir&s;t centuries of the chri&s;tian era, when di&s;putes ran high between Chri&s;tians and Pagans, the&s;e &s;ects mutually charged the plague each to the other. In 1349, the Germans a&s;cribed the plague to the Jews, and ma&s;&s;acred great numbers of that race. In Paris, during a plague, many prote&s;tant <HI>heretics</HI> were &s;acrificed, for bringing the calamity upon that city. And a propo&s;ition has been made in America to &s;top all intercour&s;e with the We&s;t-In|dies and the Mediterranean, during the &s;ummer months! A&s;|toni&s;hing blindne&s;s!</P>
<P>But, it will be a&s;ked, &s;hall we have no health laws? I an&s;wer, by all means. Their utility is obvious on many occa&s;ions. Thus when an infected fleet arrives in a port, the town is in eminent
<PB N="199" REF="036687_0554_100A8A811D1FE6F0">
danger, of what may be called a jail fever on a great &s;cale. The quantity and virulence of infection thus imported, have produced de&s;tructive con&s;equences, as at Bre&s;t in 1757, where were lan|ded in November and placed in ho&s;pitals, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">out five thou&s;and di&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed &s;eamen and troops from &s;hips, mo&s;tly out of De la Mot|te's fleet, from Loui&s;burg, with a malignant fever on board. The effect was that ten thou&s;and men died, in the ho&s;pitals, the &s;ucceeding winter, and many of the inhabitants of Bre&s;t. But it will be remarked, that this infectious di&s;ea&s;e did not become an <HI>epidemic</HI> in Bre&s;t; it &s;pread only by infection; and as &s;oon as that was di&s;&s;ipated, the di&s;ea&s;e di&s;appeared. It raged in winter and &s;ub&s;ided in &s;pring. This is an important di&s;tinction, always to be ob&s;erved by tho&s;e who guard the public health&mdash;an <HI>epidemic</HI> pe&s;|tilence begins when the &s;ea&s;on or the &s;tate of air favors it, and rages without control, again&s;t all human efforts; the common air becomes tainted, &s;o as to produce the di&s;ea&s;e, without the infec|ting principle from bodies or clothes, and the di&s;ea&s;es &s;ub&s;ide on|ly at the command of the &s;ea&s;ons and the elements. Again&s;t &s;uch, no legal provi&s;ions are or can be of any avail, and &s;uch is u&s;ually the yellow fever of our country.</P>
<P>But di&s;ea&s;es propagated only by infection, like the jail and &s;hip fever, never put on the form of an epidemic. They rage in crouded pri&s;ons and &s;hips, where they are generated; and when multitudes are crouded into ho&s;pitals, they carry the evil with them; and all per&s;ons, coming within reach of the infection, are liable to &s;uffer. In this manner, Bre&s;t lo&s;t many of her in|habitants; a town in America is &s;aid to have done the &s;ame, from the yellow fever, imported in Sir Francis Wheeler's fleet, as already related. But in &s;uch ca&s;es, the infecting di&s;ea&s;e re|quires contact or near approach to aid its propagation; and does not a&s;&s;ume the complexion of an epidemic. The two &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e are as di&s;tingui&s;hable as light from darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus, at the Black a&s;&s;izes in Oxford, in 1577, a malignant or jail fever of a &s;ingular kind, was produced &s;uddenly&mdash;almo&s;t all the court and &s;pectators were &s;eized&mdash;many died&mdash;but no epi|demic followed in Oxford; and in this in&s;tance, the effect was &s;o &s;udden, that the human body did not generate infection.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="036687_0555_100A8A82ACBE9318">So al&s;o at the Old Bailey, not many years pa&s;t, a few pri&s;on|ers, entering the court from a dirty jail, without changing their dre&s;s, infected a large number of per&s;ons who died; but no epi|demic followed&mdash;the infection was &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated, and there was an end of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>With our pe&s;tilential fever, this is not the ca&s;e, nor with any epidemic plague that ever exi&s;ted. Remove the &s;ick, clean&s;e the hou&s;es and clothes, do whatever human art and labor is compe|tent to effect, all will not avail&mdash;ca&s;es &s;pring up in every quarter, and the di&s;ea&s;e takes its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>So it was in Candia in 1592, as related from Thuanus, un|der that year. As &s;oon as the plague appeared, all the &s;ick and all the &s;u&s;pected were removed from the city; but to no purpo&s;e; it raged till July&mdash;then abated without any human means and re|vived again in October.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ays the author of Trait&eacute; de la pe&s;te, "Univer&s;al clean|&s;ings have proved u&s;ele&s;s; the plague has ravaged places after ev|ery precaution; and after negligence it has entirely cea&s;ed, as in Naples."</P>
<P>Such are the facts; and hence the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;tingui&s;hing carefully between <HI>epidemic</HI> pe&s;tilence, proceeding principally from general cau&s;es in the elements, and marked by other epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, by the failure of vegetable productions and by the &s;ick|ne&s;s, or death of cattle, fi&s;h and other animals&mdash;and <HI>di&s;ea&s;es merely infectious,</HI> generated by artificial means, which <HI>may</HI> be communicated, which may happen in jails, &s;hips and camps, in the healthie&s;t &s;tate of the elements, and which cea&s;e, as &s;oon as the infection can be di&s;&s;ipated by purifications and fre&s;h air. Without this di&s;tinction, the merit of legi&s;lative and police-regu|lations, can never be duly appreciated. Such regulations, ap|plied to <HI>epidemics,</HI> as they continually are, prove totally futile&mdash; applied to di&s;ea&s;es of mere infection and of &s;pecific contagion, as jail fever and &s;mall pox, they may be and often are the means of pre&s;erving multitudes of lives.</P>
<P>It is important therefore that health laws &s;hould be judiciou&s;ly framed and &s;trictly executed, becau&s;e there <HI>may</HI> be ca&s;es in which public health will be pre&s;erved by them; altho they never can
<PB N="201" REF="036687_0556_100AA5102D830040">
reach the cau&s;e or prevent the ravages of epidemics, which orig|inate where they exi&s;t.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to merchant-men, health-laws may al&s;o be of &s;ome u&s;e, in pre&s;erving the lives of &s;eamen, and of per&s;ons con|cerned in the ve&s;&s;els. Sick men may generate a &s;mall degree of infection; but on board of merchant-men, the number of &s;ea|men is too &s;mall to infect a &s;hip, &s;o as to endanger public health, unle&s;s &s;hamefully neglected.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t danger from merchant-men is from the foul air gene|rated, on long voyages and in hot &s;ea&s;ons, from peri&s;hable and fermenting &s;ub&s;tances. From &s;uch vitiated air, deprived of its vital principle, great danger may ari&s;e to the per&s;ons who fir&s;t open and enter the holds; and perhaps to a neighborhood. It is of great con&s;equence therefore to u&s;e ventilators freely on board of ve&s;&s;els, freighted with peri&s;hable articles; and to have them effectually clean&s;ed, before they are &s;uffered to approach our wharves.</P>
<P>But I am not convinced that the air of &s;uch ve&s;&s;els ever yet <HI>originated</HI> an epidemic fever. It appears to me, that the Acad|emy of Medicine in Philadelphia, lay more &s;tre&s;s on this cau&s;e, than it de&s;erves. The &s;phere of the operation of &s;uch a &s;mall morbid cau&s;e, cannot be exten&s;ive; and all the foul air of the large&s;t ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t be &s;o attenuated by diffu&s;ion, as not to pro|duce deleterious effects, at any great di&s;tance. It may be inju|rious to a &s;mall neighborhood; but I do not conceive it po&s;&s;ible, that the noxious air of a few &s;quare yards, can impregnate the whole atmo&s;phere of a city; and as to infection from the &s;ick, I have repeatedly proved, that this can never produce an epi|demic. I will admit the <HI>bare po&s;&s;ibility,</HI> that imported infection may enkindle the flame of pe&s;tilence, in a place fitted for it by local cau&s;es, where no pe&s;tilence would appear without a &s;park from infection. This is as much as I can admit to be po&s;&s;ible, and more than I believe; after a more minute and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">areful inve&s;ti|gation of facts probably, than was ever before made in America. Mo&s;t of the ca&s;es I can find, where accurate accounts are pre|&s;erved, of &s;uppo&s;ed importation or communication of autumnal di&s;ea&s;es, fail utterly of proofs to &s;upport common opinion; and
<PB N="202" REF="036687_0557_100AA511B9CAA998">
many of them are incontrovertibly proved to have had their ori|gin in the places where they have exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y, I aver, to di&s;tingui&s;h, in every ca&s;e, the nature of pe&s;tilence; that is, whether it is an epidemic, proceeding from a &s;tate of the elements, or a di&s;ea&s;e generated &s;olely by foul air, artificially collected. In a few weeks, if not a few days, a di&s;|ea&s;e will &s;how whether it proceeds from infection only or from a general elemental &s;ource; and when it appears to proceed from the elements, men may ju&s;t as well attempt to &s;ave the cats, the wild animals or the fi&s;h in the ocean from the effects of that principle, as their own &s;pecies, by laws enjoining quarantine and purification of &s;hips. The &s;ame cau&s;e that de&s;troys the cats or the fi&s;h in one ca&s;e, de&s;troys human life in the other; and that cau&s;e exi&s;ts in the elements; it is at home; quarantine laws do not reach it.</P>
<P>An epidemic di&s;ea&s;e may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a di&s;ea&s;e pro|ceeding from infection or &s;pecific contagion, by the following cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. An epidemic pe&s;tilence is preceded by influenza, affec|tions of the throat, or acute and malignant fevers.</P>
<P N="2">2d. An epidemic predominates over other di&s;ea&s;es; totally ab&s;orbing them or compelling them to a&s;&s;ume its characteri&s;tic &s;ymptoms. This la&s;t circum&s;tance is deci&s;ive of the character of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>A di&s;ea&s;e propagated by contagion or infection only is not thus di&s;tingui&s;hed. It has no precur&s;ors, it extends and &s;preads only by contact or near approach; and has no effect on the di&s;ea&s;es in its vicinity. The &s;mall pox or jail fever, depending on mere in|fection, never expel a dy&s;entery or intermitting fever.</P>
<P>In every po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e, a plague that bani&s;hes other di&s;ea&s;es, as I believe it always does, is an epidemic generated in the place where it exi&s;ts; for it is not po&s;&s;ible that this expul&s;ion of other di&s;ea&s;es, could take place, unle&s;s the epidemic depended &s;olely on the elements. Simple infection would not change the &s;ymp|toms of another di&s;ea&s;e, even in the next hou&s;e, much le&s;s in all parts of a city.</P>
<P>To &s;how how little an epidemic depends on infection, let us advert to facts. In all the ea&s;tern countries, the plague is &s;uffer|ed
<PB N="203" REF="036687_0558_100AA513F6DE0540">
to take its own cour&s;e without re&s;traint. There are no regu|lations to control its progre&s;s, or prevent its return. Its begin|ning is u&s;ually gradual; a few die the fir&s;t year; the proper &s;ea|&s;on &s;u&s;pends its progre&s;s; the next year it is more general, and often, the third year is the mo&s;t fatal.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that after its mo&s;t exten&s;ive effects, it abates and &s;uddenly di&s;appears. In London, the malignant precur&s;ors of the plague of 1665, appeared as early as 1661; but no &s;oon|er had its cri&s;is pa&s;&s;ed, than in a few months, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was totally ex|tingui&s;hed. The &s;ame happened at Aleppo in 1, 62, and &s;uch is u&s;ually the fact.</P>
<P>Let any man &s;uppo&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e to be propagated wholly or mo&s;tly by infection, and attend to the con&s;equences. In Alep|po, &s;ays Ru&s;&s;el, died 500, in 1760; in 1761, died 7000, and in 1762, 11,000. On the principle of infection then, &s;ome &s;ick man or a bundle of old clothes, fir&s;t &s;preads the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o as to de&s;troy 500 lives&mdash;the infection of 500, de&s;troys 7000 lives, the infection of 7000, de&s;troys 11,000 lives; and the next year, the infection of 11,000 de&s;troys&mdash;none at all!</P>
<P>In London, a few bales of cotton, &s;muggled into the city from Holland, in 1664, communicated infection that de&s;troyed 68,000 lives; the infection from this immen&s;e number proves fatal, the next year, to 1900 only; and the&s;e, the year following, infect only 35! If infection has much con|cern in propagating that di&s;ea&s;e, its operation certainly defeats all arithmetical calculation of its phy&s;ical powers!</P>
<P>The whole theory of infection, to which Mead has given &s;o much celebrity, and which is maintained by many phy&s;icians in this country, is ab&s;urd and ridiculous from fir&s;t to la&s;t; leading legi&s;lators, magi&s;trates and citizens a&s;tray from the truth, produ|cing mo&s;t &s;erious inconveniences to commerce, and preventing the adoption of the only means of mitigating the pe&s;tilence to which our cities are expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>In Turkey and Egypt no pains are taken to clean&s;e hou&s;es or clothes after a plague. No &s;ooner has a great plague cea&s;ed, which has cut off 300,000 people in Con&s;tantinople or Cairo, than the infected hou&s;es are filled by other people, who replace the dead, u&s;e the furniture and the bedding on which the infected
<PB N="204" REF="036687_0559_100AA515BAD8E548">
had died; or the old clothes are &s;ent to auction and purcha&s;ed by Jews, who retail them out for u&s;e, unclean&s;ed; and yet amid&s;t all this ma&s;s of concentrated infection, no per&s;on has the plague, or if a &s;poradic ca&s;e occurs here and there, no epidemic en&s;ues, for two, three or four years, perhaps longer; then all at once, when the infection mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be de&s;troyed, by the action of air and water, the di&s;ea&s;e breaks out again, and becomes epidemic. Then &s;ome arrival from an infected place is hunted out, and the calamity is charged to the account of &s;ome poor &s;ick &s;eaman, or his clothes! The infection of half a million of people, produ|ces no plague in one year; but in another, the invi&s;ible fomes of a piece of cloth, or the breath of a &s;ingle man is &s;ufficient to &s;pread de&s;olation over a great city, or a kingdom!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hodges informs us, that after the plague in London, in 1665, peo|ple returned into hou&s;es not clean&s;ed, and even &s;lept in beds on which the infected had died, without fear or injury. This is not at all &s;trange. Unle&s;s the effluvia from the &s;ick have been clo&s;ely confined and are greatly conden&s;ed, they will not affect a well per&s;on; and indeed it is a difficult thing to pre&s;erve the morbid matter, in &s;ufficient quantity to communicate di&s;ea&s;e in cold weather.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such are the ab&s;urdities of the modern notions about the plague, which adorn this &s;plendid era of philo&s;ophy and &s;cience!&mdash;</P>
<P>Of the nature of the infecting principle in di&s;ea&s;es, we know very little; and even its effects are not always comprehen&s;ible. We ob&s;erve differences al&s;o in the operation of the principle, which we cannot explain. Why the &s;mall-pox &s;hould be com|municated, under <HI>all</HI> circum&s;tances; the plague only under cer|tain circum&s;tances, is a my&s;tery not yet unfolded. It is &s;uppo&s;|ed, that the di&s;ea&s;ed body di&s;charges certain fine poi&s;onous parti|cles, which are &s;u&s;pended and diffu&s;ed in the air, and being im|bibed by the pores of the &s;kin, and with the breath, excite the &s;ame &s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies of di&s;temper in a healthy body. The&s;e effluvia generally e&s;cape our &s;ight and very often our other &s;en&s;es; but they may be concentrated in &s;uch quantities, as to be very ob|noxious to the olfactory organs, and even to excite &s;udden nau|&s;ea in the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>But why the effluvia from the &s;mall-pox, anginas and the mea|&s;les &s;hould be independent of heat and cold; and tho&s;e of dy&s;|entery, plague, and other typhus fevers, &s;ubject to be excited
<PB N="205" REF="036687_0560_100AA51772E455E8">
into action by the one, and to be de&s;troyed by the other, is a phenomenon never yet explained. We may &s;ay the particles i&s;|&s;uing from the former cla&s;s, are more &s;ubtle, volatile, and pene|trating; but this is all conjecture. Certain it is, that the poi&s;on of &s;mall pox, angina and mea&s;les, is of a more di&s;tinct, &s;pecific kind, than that of the plague, le&s;s connected, in its operation, with putrid exhalations from other bodies, and le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of grades in its powers.</P>
<P>So far as I am able to comprehend the nature of the infection of plague and other autumnal di&s;ea&s;es, pa&s;&s;ing under the popular name of <HI>putrid,</HI> it appears to con&s;i&s;t of a &s;pecies of air, which is one of the elementary parts of all vegetable and animal &s;ub|&s;tances. It may be what Dr. Mitchell denominates, the <HI>&s;eptic acid;</HI> that fluid which is di&s;charged from fle&s;h in the proce&s;s of putrefaction. It may be &s;ome other &s;pecies; but it is very evi|dent, from all its effects, that it operates, in producing di&s;ea&s;e, no otherwi&s;e than all the morbid exhalations extricated from ev|ery &s;pecies of vegetable and animal &s;ub&s;tances in the putrefac|tive proce&s;s. In all or mo&s;t of &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances, there is, it is well known, a &s;pecies of air or acid matter, which, when in a form detached from other &s;ub&s;tances, is highly noxious to health. To this fluid, or &s;eptic acid, evolved from vegetables in a &s;tate of natural putrefaction, and floating in an aerial form, is a&s;cribed the whole cla&s;s of bilious fevers, which prevail near mar&s;hes.</P>
<P>Hence, the effluvia from a per&s;on laboring under the plague, are &s;u&s;ceptible of all degrees of concentration, and in proportion to their concentration, will be their violence, and certainty of effect, when they attach them&s;elves to a healthy body. In this re&s;pect the infe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on of the plague differs mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially from that of the &s;mall pox. The matter of contagion in the &s;mall pox, however &s;mall, is &s;ufficient to communicate the di&s;ea&s;e; and it is cu&s;tomary for phy&s;icians to wipe clean the point of a lan|cet, dipped in variolous matter, before it is in&s;erted in the &s;kin, for the purpo&s;e of inoculation. It is al&s;o proved by experi|ments that the quantity of infection introduced by inoculation, whether more or le&s;s, makes no material difference in the num|ber of pu&s;tles, or violence of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="036687_0561_100AA5191D0F4CF0">But in the plague, the operation of infection is very different. This di&s;ea&s;e, if light, produces no infection, or very little&mdash; more violent ca&s;es appear to be more apt to be communicated&mdash; and in great plagues, the infection is vi&s;ibly augmented. Yet in mo&s;t pe&s;tilences, an in&s;tantaneous expo&s;ure to the effluvia from the &s;ick will rarely produce any effect, as in the ca&s;e of &s;mall pox and mea&s;les. It u&s;ually requires a per&s;on to be a con&s;iderable time in the room with the &s;ick, in the plague, to receive poi&s;on|ous air &s;ufficient to excite di&s;ea&s;e; and more generally, it is not communicated, without handling the &s;ick or imbibing his breath. In many ca&s;es, all this expo&s;ure for weeks and months together, will excite no di&s;ea&s;e. Hence Ru&s;&s;el repre&s;ents the plague, as of different degrees of malignity and not always infectious. Hence the propriety of clo&s;e and indefatigable attention, in pe&s;|tilence, to every article of cleanline&s;s; for by this means, the quantity of infection is reduced, and the danger dimini&s;hed, from a high degree down to nothing. Not &s;o, in &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les, the contagion of which regards no filth or cleanline&s;s.</P>
<P>The infection of the plague, dy&s;entery and the like &s;eems therefore, to be nothing more than an <HI>acce&s;s of noxious matter, to the local cau&s;es, morbid exhalations.</HI> The noxious air of filthy &s;treets, docks and tenements, are &s;econdary and augmenting cau&s;es of the plague; when the di&s;ea&s;e appears, the effluvia from the di&s;ea&s;ed &s;till <HI>augment</HI> the&s;e other lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al cau&s;es. Thus when a certain &s;tate of air, in a city generally, will produce a malig|nant fever, and per&s;ons are expo&s;ed to it by walking in the &s;treets, a &s;ick per&s;on, confined in a clo&s;e room, will &s;oon fill that room with exhalations from his lungs and pores, which will render that room <HI>more dangerous</HI> to a per&s;on in health, than the open &s;treet. This &s;eems to be the amount of the infection of plague and other autumnal di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus al&s;o in a violent plague, the common air of the &s;treets becomes &s;o highly infected, that per&s;ons attending the &s;ick can|not po&s;&s;ibly determin whether they take the di&s;ea&s;e from the common atmo&s;phere, or from their intercour&s;e with infected per|&s;ons. The only ca&s;es which afford certainty in this re&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t, are, when the di&s;ea&s;ed are removed into the pure air of the country,
<PB N="207" REF="036687_0562_100AA51D54A4CA40">
and nur&s;es and vi&s;itors, who have breathed no pe&s;tilential air in the city, are taken ill, in a few days after &s;uch intercour&s;e with the &s;ick. The&s;e would be clearly the produce of infection. But the&s;e ca&s;es rarely occur. It has already been ob&s;erved that the wor&s;t ca&s;es of pe&s;tilence removed into the country, &s;eldom infect the attendants. This &s;hows how little apprehen&s;ion ought to be excited by mere infection, and how ill-founded are the alarms in the country, about the &s;preading of the yellow fever; alarms that often occa&s;ion a neglect of di&s;ea&s;ed fugitives from the city. People in the country have little to fear from infection, if the &s;ick are kept in airy rooms and cleanly; they ought not to abandon the &s;ick; for the duties of humanity are not incompat|ible with their &s;afety. It is the infected ground, if I may &s;o call it, the local atmo&s;phere of pe&s;tilence which is to be dreaded, and e&s;pecially by &s;trangers. During its prevalence, in a city or town, the air of the place is rank poi&s;on to per&s;ons, accu&s;|tomed to good air.</P>
<P>The preceding facts and di&s;tinctions enable us to form a ju&s;t e&s;|timate of the importance of health laws. In nine ca&s;es of ten, in which quarantine is enjoined, human efforts are oppo&s;ed to the great laws of nature, and are therefore u&s;ele&s;s. In all ca&s;es, where the air of a country exhibits evidences of a pe&s;tilential con&s;titution, in an increa&s;e of the number and violence of the &s;ymp|toms of common di&s;ea&s;es; in the production of certain epidem|ics, as catarrh, anginas, mea&s;les, petechial fevers and the like; in the death of fi&s;h or the unu&s;ual di&s;ea&s;es of cattle and other an|imals; in the production of in&s;ects, uncommon in &s;ize, in kind or numbers; and other remarkable phenomena, before mention|ed; in all &s;uch ca&s;es, the pe&s;tilence which invades man will be found to ari&s;e &s;olely from the uncontrollable laws of the elements; and quarantine will be utterly unavailing to guard cities again&s;t its introduction and ravages. The remedy is not applied to the &s;ource of the di&s;ea&s;e. Hence the efforts of the police in London in the la&s;t century, and of Dantzick and Mar&s;eilles in this, were entirely u&s;ele&s;s; and hence the failure of all health laws to &s;ave our cities from the late epidemics.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="036687_0563_100AA51EDB96DDC0">Satisfied as I am of this truth, I would not lay a&s;ide the appli|cation of the&s;e laws. The bare po&s;&s;ibility of &s;aving the lives of a few individuals, and e&s;pecially of di&s;ea&s;ed &s;eamen, is a good rea&s;on for clean&s;ing &s;hips after long voyages, and of purifying their cargoes, when in a bad &s;tate. But what I contend for, is, that we mu&s;t not expect the be&s;t health laws, mo&s;t rigorou&s;ly executed, will ever be &s;ucce&s;sful in g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ding cities again&s;t <HI>epidemic</HI> pe&s;tilence. In our reliance on &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ions, we expo&s;e our&s;elves to per|petual di&s;appointment; we expo&s;e the lives of citizens; we over|look the true cau&s;es of the evil, and neglect the only means of preventing or mitigating its effects.</P>
<P>Further, the opinion of the &s;pecific contagion of the plague has originated many, not only u&s;ele&s;s, but barbarous regulations. Such is the practice of confining the &s;ick to clo&s;e hou&s;es; and &s;till more, of confining the citizens of an infected town within its limits, by an armed force&mdash;which I am informed has been done in Europe. In Mar&s;eilles, the fir&s;t per&s;ons &s;eized were con|fined to their hou&s;es by the point of the bayonet.</P>
<P>An ignorance of the nature of a di&s;ea&s;e and its degree of dan|ger, may be pardonable in a prince or the legi&s;lators of a free &s;tate. But there is a point, beyond which ignorance in medical profe&s;|&s;ors, becomes a crime. No &s;cience is nece&s;&s;ary however to con|vince any man, that mo&s;t pe&s;tilences, proceed only from the de|ranged &s;tate of the elements, aided by the morbid exhalations of cities. This is a fact that may be known to a certainty by very little reading and ob&s;ervation. It was well known in pa&s;t ages, when men were more governed by ob&s;ervation, than by theories and erroneous rea&s;oning. Mead's attempts to prove the &s;pecific contagion of plague, aided by his popularity, had a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s; his treati&s;e was received as a &s;tandard of truth; it every where &s;u&s;pended enquiries and checked a &s;pirit of inve&s;tigation, which might have di&s;&s;ipated error; it was the ba|&s;is of the pre&s;ent laws of quarantine, which are applied, in thou|&s;ands of ca&s;es, where they are as improper and as little wanted, as if applied to prevent an epidemic pleuri&s;y, or head-ache, em|barra&s;&s;ing commerce, without the &s;hadow of nece&s;&s;ity. But the&s;e are not the wor&s;t effects. The erroneous &s;y&s;tem of &s;pecific con|tagion,
<PB N="209" REF="036687_0564_100AA520AC820EE8">
has mi&s;lead mankind into a fatal &s;ecurity, on the &s;ubject of the local cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es. Suppo&s;ing the laws competent to guard public health, men have not attended to the be&s;t modes of con&s;tructing hou&s;es and cities, and to the means of watering and clean&s;ing them&mdash;means by which all the &s;lighter pe&s;tilences might be avoided, and the more &s;evere ones, greatly mitigated. Hence I am per&s;uaded, that the received theory of &s;pecific contagion is the direct cau&s;e of mo&s;t of the fatal plagues that now &s;courge civ|ilized Europe and America. For it will be ob&s;erved, that pe&s;|tilence has always been the <HI>peculiar cur&s;e</HI> of <HI>populous cities.</HI> Of about two hundred general plagues, recorded in hi&s;tory, a few only have been &s;o violent as to &s;pread over countries into villages and farm hou&s;es; almo&s;t all have been limited to large towns, evi|dently demon&s;trating that they would never have affected man|kind, without the influence of the impure air generated in tho&s;e places. This is a truth, as unque&s;tionable as it is important; and on a conviction of this hangs the &s;afety of men from that dreadful calamity. Had Mead, and other eminent phy&s;icians taken the &s;ame pains to lead mankind into truth, as into error, we &s;hould long ago have introduced improvements into the ar|rangement and &s;tructure of our cities, which would have &s;ecured our citizens from nine tenths of the infectious di&s;ea&s;es, by which they have been alarmed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, had men under&s;tood the common operation of infection, which may be made obvious to the mo&s;t ordinary minds, merchants would not, at this day, have been harra&s;&s;ed with the nece&s;&s;ity of performing quarantine, to guard again&s;t <HI>epi|demic</HI> di&s;ea&s;es. We &s;hould not have &s;een a &s;hip from the We&s;t-Indies condemned to the flames, in a Briti&s;h port, becau&s;e &s;he had lo&s;t her crew by the yellow fever; nor merchantmen from an American port obliged to ride quarantine in the Briti&s;h chan|nel, becau&s;e that di&s;ea&s;e prevailed in this country. Phy&s;icians, had they not been blinded by &s;y&s;tem, and taken opinions for granted, without enquiry into the grounds on which they re&s;t, would have known before this, that the yellow fever will not &s;pread in England, Scotland or Ireland. It never &s;hows it&s;elf

in America, without a much greater degree of heat, than the ordinary &s;ummer temperature of tho&s;e countries. The heat in tho&s;e latitudes rarely exceeds, for a few hours, in a &s;ingle day, 75 or at mo&s;t 78 degrees by Farenheit. But no epidemic yel|low fever is ever generated, in our climate, with that degree of heat. In general, we never &s;ee ca&s;es of that di&s;ea&s;e in America, until we have had a period of heat ri&s;ing, for a con&s;iderable time, to 85 deg. or higher. In any &s;ea&s;on of ordinary temperature, the yellow fever, in the Briti&s;h kingdoms, and other parallels of latitude, introduced from abroad by &s;eamen or others from war|mer climates, would immediately &s;ub&s;ide and be extingui&s;hed, without any human efforts. The ca&s;es of malignant fever in England, which turn the body yellow, and which &s;ometimes oc|cur, as mentioned by Lind, are generated about mar&s;hes, in ho&s;|pitals, camps, &s;hips and pri&s;ons. An epidemic yellow fever, like that which prevails in America, was never known in Eng|land, and probably cannot exi&s;t in the climate. The quarantine enjoined on ve&s;&s;els from the We&s;t-Indies and United States, is utterly u&s;ele&s;s in guarding that country from this pe&s;tilence in the form of an epidemic.</P>
<P>It m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y be &s;aid, in an&s;wer to the&s;e remarks, that the yellow fe|ver and plague are e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e; the plague has of|ten raged in Great Britain, and therefore the climate may not re|&s;i&s;t the prevalence of the yellow fever.</P>
<P>But if the plague has raged in Great Britain, which is admit|ted, it mu&s;t have ari&s;en from the unhealthy &s;tate of the elements, which may exi&s;t in any latitude, or from very &s;ingular &s;ea&s;ons, aided by mo&s;t powerful local cau&s;es, as in London before it was burnt. I &s;ay the yellow fever will not &s;pread in England, in the <HI>ordinary</HI> &s;tate of the elements, and the <HI>ordinary</HI> temperature of the &s;ummer. If pe&s;tilence ever invades cool northerly countries, it mu&s;t always proceed principally from di&s;orders in the elements and &s;ea&s;ons. The ordinary cau&s;es, in temperate or cool cli|mates, have but little influence in generating pe&s;tilence. Hence in common &s;ea&s;ons, in England, no plague, bilious or inguinal, could be &s;pread, unle&s;s in a crouded jail, camp, or dirty, con|fined alley in a city.

I challenge all the faculty in Europe, to mention an in|&s;tance, in which plague has ever prevailed, without &s;uch phe|nomena.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it &s;eems to be probable, that more heat is nece&s;&s;ary to generate and to propagate the bilious, than the glandular plague. My rea&s;ons for this opinion, are, that the glandular plague appears in &s;pring much earlier than the bilious. It often appears in the northern parts of Europe, as early as March and often in May, when the weather is yet cool. But the bilious plague of our climate has not &s;howed it&s;elf, in &s;poradic ca&s;es, till June, and then very rarely, and only in a few &s;cattered ca&s;es of a le&s;s malignant type, than at a later &s;ea&s;on. To this remark, I have heard of only one exception. Generally, the di&s;ea&s;e does not appear till we have experienced &s;ome days of our hotte&s;t weather, and not till the la&s;t week in July, except in a few ca&s;es as before mentioned. It does not become formidable, as an epi|demic, till the tenth or twentieth of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>This difference &s;eems to depend on the following circum|&s;tances. The glandular plague of Europe, A&s;ia and Africa, when it breaks out in the northern latitudes, as on the Baltic or in Great Britain, &s;eems to be more e&s;&s;entially and principally the product of a defective &s;tate of the elements, joined to human ex|halations in large cities; both which cau&s;es are le&s;s dependent on heat, than the morbid exhalations of the vegetable world, which &s;eem to give to our American plague its peculiar charac|ter, and to be a powerful cau&s;e of the di&s;temper. I am further confirmed in this opinion, by this circum&s;tance. A di&s;tinction between the bili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> fevers of our <HI>cities,</HI> and of our <HI>mar&s;hy grounds</HI> on rivers, is ob&s;erved to exi&s;t, in perfect analogy with the foregoing di&s;tinction between our bilious plague and the glan|dular plague. The mortal fevers, about mar&s;hes in the interior of our country, are le&s;s infectious, than the pe&s;tilential fevers of
<PB N="212" REF="036687_0567_100AA5281E5434B8">
our cities, altho they are at times as fatal, and are characterized by a yellow &s;kin. The&s;e &s;eem then to proceed <HI>wholly</HI> from veg|etable exhalations. The fevers of our cities approach nearer to the plague of the ea&s;t, becau&s;e they proceed both from <HI>animal</HI> and <HI>vegetable</HI> exhalations, but the vegetable effluvia have a more predominating influence here, than in countries which are dry or better cultivated. Hence the mortal bilious fevers of our interi|or country evidently form a link in the &s;eries of gradation, be|tween the common remittents, and the yellow fever of our cities; ju&s;t as the yellow fever con&s;titutes a grade between our river or lake fevers, and the Levant plague.</P>

Intermittents and remittents exhibit a yellow &s;kin, more or le&s;s, but no infection worth naming&mdash;the river or lake plague, a very yellow &s;kin, with morbid &s;ymptoms, but little in|fection&mdash;the bilious plague of cities, &s;ometimes a yellow &s;kin, &s;ometimes not; and &s;ome ca&s;es of glandular tumors, carbuncle and petechiae; with more infection&mdash;the Levant plague, le&s;s yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin, and u&s;ually infection and glandular &s;wel|lings. Thus, in proportion as the vegetable exhalations predom|inate,

in the &s;cale of exciting cau&s;es, there is more yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin, le&s;s infection, and le&s;s frequent affections of the glands&mdash;in proportion, as the animal exhalations abound, as the cau&s;e, the yellowne&s;s declines, and the affections of the glands multiply, with augmented infection.</P>
<P>It is the remark of the celebrated Zimmerman, that "exha|lations from mar&s;hes do not &s;eem to be &s;o noxious in cold, as in hot countries; yet malignant fevers occur even in Finland. In Germany the&s;e exhalations produce tertians; in Hungary, pe|techial fevers; in Italy, hemitritaea; in Egypt and Ethiopia, pe&s;|tilential fevers." On Phy&s;ic, p. 131.</P>
<P>It is therefore probable that a greater degree of heat, than the ordinary temperature of Great Britain, is nece&s;&s;ary to generate the pe&s;tilential fever of our cities. And as no degree of infec|tion ever yet accumulated on board of a merchantman, can cre|ate a pe&s;tilential atmo&s;phere, &s;ufficient to generate an epidemic, the fears of the Engli&s;h re&s;pecting &s;uch ve&s;&s;els from the United States or the We&s;t-Indies, are utterly groundle&s;s. The mar&s;h fevers of England, Scotland and of other cool climates, are of an inferior grade. Such are the autumnal fevers near the Fenn's of Lincoln, Ely and Cambridge. In Torbat, in Scotland, a putrid fever &s;ometimes prevails, and after death, the body turns yellow; this may be a&s;cribed to certain natural locks or ponds which &s;ometimes dry up in &s;ummer.</P>

<P>But the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, tho doubtle&s;s the &s;ame in &s;pecies, fall great|ly &s;hort of the violence of our pe&s;tilential yellow fever, which never did and probably never will prevail in that climate.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XVII. Of the means of preventing or mitigating pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;tep towards an effectual remedy for an evil, is to a&s;certain its nature and cau&s;e, &s;o far as they can be under&s;tood by effects. Primary cau&s;es are above the reach of man; proxi|mate cau&s;es, may be &s;o far inve&s;tigated, in mo&s;t things, as to an|&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of mankind.</P>
<P>It has been proved, in the preceding pages, and every day's ob&s;ervation confirms the fact, that one influential cau&s;e of epi|demic di&s;ea&s;es, mu&s;t exi&s;t in the elements, independent of all human control. In the production of epidemic catarrh or influ|enza, for in&s;tance, no human or artificial means appear to have any &s;hare of influence. In the mea&s;les, artificial cau&s;es &s;ome|times modify the &s;ymptoms, but have no great &s;hare in its pro|duction or propagation. A &s;imilar remark will apply to every &s;pecies of angina. The &s;mall-pox is al&s;o modified in its force and &s;ymptoms by many local circum&s;tances; and its propagation is chiefly by means of contagion; but this di&s;ea&s;e al&s;o is &s;ome|times, tho rarely, generated in particular bodies without conta|gion. The appearance of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es in the form of epidem|ics, excepting the &s;mall-pox which may ari&s;e from contagion, always indicates a pe&s;tilential con&s;titution of air; and during this con&s;titution, ordinary or annual di&s;ea&s;es, which depend on &s;ea&s;on or local cau&s;es, a&s;&s;ume more violent &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>Autumnal di&s;ea&s;es of the annual or ordinary kind, tho ren|dered more violent, fatal and exten&s;ive, by a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air, are however generated by &s;ubordinate cau&s;es, mo&s;t of which are within the power of man. The dy&s;entery depends partly on &s;ea&s;on, partly on &s;ituation, as to pure air, and partly perhaps on the imperfection of autumnal fruits&punc; Sometimes it ari&s;es in
<PB N="215" REF="036687_0570_100AA52FB9B99E50">
camps from bad diet, or want of &s;helter from the weather; and when it once exi&s;ts, is more or le&s;s propagated by infection. But this di&s;ea&s;e is rendered more malignant, by elemental cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Ordinary bilious fevers of all grades are produced u&s;ually by mia&s;mata or morbid exhalations from low, damp, mar&s;hy grounds; where vegetables, in the hot &s;ea&s;on, are in a &s;tate of rapid pu|trefaction. The&s;e fevers occur annually, and with a violence of &s;ymptoms proportioned to the extent and force of the morbid cau&s;e. The origin and phenomena of all this de&s;cription of di&s;ea&s;es are &s;o well known, as to render any ob&s;ervations of mine, unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The plague, glandular and bilious, &s;eems to be nearly allied in its &s;ymptoms, to the ordinary bilious remittent. The point &s;eems not altogether &s;ettled, whether the contagious yellow fe|ver, as it is u&s;ually called, and the common &s;poradic yellow fever of the We&s;t-Indies, and the bilious remittent, are different grades of one &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e; or whether they are of di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</P>
<P>On this point however, the late epidemics have furni&s;hed our &s;cientific men with proofs that appear to me to decide the que&s;tion, in favor of the identity of the &s;pecies. The evidence ari&s;ing from the di&s;ea&s;e in Baltimore is alone &s;ufficient to decide it, as far as it regards the yellow fever and the remitting; and the Acad|emy of Medicine in Philadelphia is a mo&s;t re&s;pectable authority in favor of the &s;ame doctrin.</P>
<P>That the glandular plague of the Levant, and the bilious, in|fectious yellow fever of our country, are &s;pecifically the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, I have no doubt; but they take &s;ome different &s;ymptoms, either from climate, or other cau&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">known. The glandular tumors are held, by mo&s;t writers on the plague, to be the char|acteri&s;tics of the di&s;ea&s;e, which alone decide its nature, and di&s;|tingui&s;h it from other malignant fevers. But Diemerbroeck and all the be&s;t authors agree that the&s;e external &s;wellings are not e&s;&s;ential to the di&s;ea&s;e, and that many have the true plague without them. They are however the u&s;ual marks of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In our bilious pe&s;tilence, the&s;e &s;wellings are le&s;s common. But, tho rare, they &s;ometimes appear, in the mo&s;t unequivocal

form of the true pe&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. I &s;aw an in&s;tance in 179<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and they were more common in the la&s;t epidemic. An in&s;tance occurred, within my knowledge, in which two auxiliary tumors appeared, and the per&s;on was never confined by fever.</P>
<P>The yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin has given name to the pe&s;tilence of our country; yet this is a misfortune, for it may deceive a common ob&s;erver. A yellow &s;kin often accompanies lower grades of bilious fevers, not pe&s;tilential; and is, by no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans, e&s;&s;ential to the infectious yellow fever. In all our late epidemics, per|&s;ons have died without exhibiting this color of the &s;kin; and it has been le&s;s common the la&s;t year, than in former years. It appears then, that the lighter the epidemic di&s;ea&s;e, the more common the yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin; and vice ver&s;a. This is no incon&s;iderable proof of the identity of the bilious and ingui|nal plague; that in proportion as the bilious plague of our cli|mate becomes violent and approaches the true plague, it lo&s;es that yellow color of the &s;kin, and a&s;&s;umes the glandular &s;wellings. This I am informed is the fact, as ob&s;erved by the phy&s;icians in New-York, the &s;ummer pa&s;t. There are however &s;ome differ|ences in the &s;ymptoms of the two &s;pecies of plague, which it belongs to the faculty to ob&s;erve and define. It may be that the moi&s;ture of our country, not yet cleared of its woods, and abounding with &s;wamps and mar&s;hes, may occa&s;ion the differen|ces in the &s;ymptoms. The parts of Europe, A&s;ia and Africa where the plague mo&s;t u&s;ually prevails, are clear of woods, and cultivated. Perhaps an increa&s;e of population, and human efflu|via, with a decrea&s;e of vegetable exhalations in America from cultivation, may in time change the form of our pe&s;tilential fever into the true inguinal plague. I have rea&s;ons for believing &s;uch a change actually took place in Rome. Some of the plagues, de&s;cribed by Livy were obviou&s;ly of the bilious kind, &s;imilar to our epidemic fever; but in later periods, the plagues in Rome are expre&s;sly de&s;cribed to be, "pe&s;tis inguinaria."</P>
<P>However this may be, the cau&s;es of pe&s;tilence I &s;uppo&s;e to be, fir&s;t &s;ome e&s;&s;ential alteration in the primary qualities of air and water, owing to &s;ea&s;ons, or to the action of the principle of fire, the main operative agent in the earth and atmo&s;phere; which al|teration
<PB N="217" REF="036687_0572_100AA5342798E2F8">
is demon&s;trated by various epidemics and e&s;pecially by ca|tarrh &mdash;&s;econdly, the &s;ubordinate cau&s;es of plague, are, noxious exhalations of every kind, which dimini&s;h the proportion of vi|tal air imbibed into the lungs. Both cau&s;es appear to produce di&s;|ea&s;e, either by exce&s;&s;ive excitement, inducing <HI>indirect</HI> debility; or by reducing excitement, and inducing <HI>direct</HI> debility. The &auml;erial or elemental cau&s;e &s;eems to produce exce&s;&s;ive excitement; for its fir&s;t effect appears in catarrh, a di&s;ea&s;e of &s;tenic or inflam|matory diathe&s;is. Thus the pre&s;ent epidemic con&s;titution was preceded by influenza, of univer&s;al prevalence and of &s;evere &s;ymp|toms.</P>
<P>Mea&s;les, another di&s;ea&s;e that rarely fails to characterize the early &s;tages of a pe&s;tilential con&s;titution, is al&s;o of an inflamma|tory diathe&s;is. The &s;ame is true of the common di&s;tinct &s;mall-pox &mdash;another di&s;ea&s;e, which, before the art of inoculation, &s;eldom failed to rage in cities, during &s;uch a con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Anginas are of different types; &s;ome of the milder kinds are ranged by Brown amomg &s;tenic di&s;ea&s;es; but the angina maligna he con&s;iders as a&s;tenic. Di&s;ea&s;es of this cla&s;s however form a part of the effects of a pe&s;tilential con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Next to this &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;es, may be arranged the petechial fevers, which under the names of purple, or &s;potted, have often over&s;pread Europe, and rarely fail to precede the plague. The&s;e are the product of the la&s;t &s;tages of a pe&s;tilential con&s;titution, next to the true plague, which marks the cri&s;is. The&s;e forms of malignant fever have never occurred in America, as epidem|ics; but purple and livid &s;pots, vibices and all the variety of eruptions, which belong to that cla&s;s of di&s;ea&s;es, occur occa&s;ion|ally during pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>It is a remarkable fact, and one that &s;eems to have e&s;caped ob|&s;ervation, that a pe&s;tilential con&s;titution of air in all ages and countries, produces epidemic di&s;orders of the <HI>eruptive</HI> kind. I que&s;tion whether in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, &s;ince the days of Mo&s;es, the real plague, ever became epidemic, without one, two or all of that kind of di&s;ea&s;es for its precur&s;ors. We cannot look into an author, who has de&s;cribed the di&s;ea&s;es which prevail in &s;uch
<PB N="218" REF="036687_0573_100AA53864D060A0">
a con&s;titution, from Hippocrates down to our time, but we &s;ee ignes &s;acri, variolae, morbilli or other <HI>eruptive</HI> di&s;orders, con&s;ti|tuting a part of the de&s;cription. The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es &s;eem evidently to be cla&s;&s;ed by the laws of nature, and always to appear, in clo&s;e connection.</P>
<P>Hence the propriety of Sydenham's ob&s;ervation, p. 120 that "the ery&s;ipelas, ignis &s;acer, is a good deal like the plague, and &s;ometimes accompanied with pains in the glands&mdash;that it begins much in the &s;ame manner as the plague, but the plague is much more violent than an ery&s;ipelas."</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o we ob&s;erve that Hippocrates, in de&s;cribing a pe&s;|tilential con&s;titution, mentions that before &s;pring appeared "eru|&s;ip&eacute;lata polla," many ca&s;es of the ery&s;ipelas, of a bad type, and mortal.</P>
<BIBL>De morb. Vulgar. Sec. 2.</BIBL>
<P>This is a curious phenomenon and worthy of inve&s;tigation, that a particular con&s;titution of the atmo&s;phere, &s;hould, in its different &s;tages or in different &s;ea&s;ons of the year, tend to generate all tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, which throw out upon the &s;urface of the body, petechiae, vibices, a general efflore&s;cence and tumors, with various other appearances. It belongs to medical men to explain the general proximate cau&s;e, which, while its effects are various, &s;till gives to di&s;ea&s;es &s;ome common &s;imilitude.</P>
<P>In America, a pe&s;tilential con&s;titution exhibits the &s;ame phe|nomena, as mea&s;les, and anginas, but without the purple or &s;potted fever, as the precur&s;or of our pe&s;tilence. The immedi|ate precur&s;ors of the bilious plague in America, are catarrhous affections, di&s;orders of the throat, and e&s;pecially bilious fevers of a bad type, ending often in black vomit. Detached ca&s;es of this latter di&s;ea&s;e rarely or never fail to introduce or p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cede the in|fectious epidemic.</P>
<P>But no di&s;ea&s;e whatever &s;eems more clo&s;ely connected with pe&s;tilence than catarrh. An epidemic influenza, is almo&s;t inva|riably the &s;ignal of the approach of a pe&s;tilential con&s;titution; and during the whole exi&s;tence of the con&s;titution, catarrhous affections are frequent in particular &s;ea&s;ons, and e&s;pecially ju&s;t before or after the prevalence of a pe&s;tilential fever. This cir|cum&s;tance affords no incon&s;iderable evidence, that what we call
<PB N="219" REF="036687_0574_100AA5363022EBF8">
an epidemic con&s;titution acts upon the human body as a violent &s;timulus. The fir&s;t di&s;ea&s;es excited by it are u&s;ually of the in|flammatory diathe&s;is as catarrh and mea&s;les. Hence perhaps we derive a clue to explain the my&s;tery of the pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es which &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>The continued effect of exce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus, mu&s;t be debility. The epidemic con&s;titution, when it fir&s;t commences, is mild, and produces &s;tenic di&s;ea&s;es, not very mortal, as catarrh and mea&s;les; for a very obvious rea&s;on, the force of the &s;timulus is not at fir&s;t &s;ufficient to ha&s;ten on the indirect debility of the &s;y&s;tem, or to produce the a&s;tenic diathe&s;is in a fatal degree. But as this &s;tate of air advances in &s;trength, the &s;timulus is greater; and when aided by the heat of &s;ummer, produces a degree of excitement, that &s;peedily induces univer&s;al debility. Hence the pe&s;tilential fevers of &s;ummer and autumn &s;eem to be the effect of exce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus, acting upon the &s;y&s;tem with &s;uch violence, as to produce &s;peedy debility, in con&s;equence of which, all the functions of the &s;y&s;tem are weakened and deranged&mdash;the &s;tomach does not dige&s;t food&mdash;the peri&s;taltic motion is imperfect and feeble&mdash;the liver and the gall-bladder do not perform their &s;ecretions&mdash;the energy of the brain is dimini&s;hed&mdash;the extreme ve&s;&s;els are relaxed. The con|&s;equence is, that part of aliment which ought to be &s;eparated and carried off by the inte&s;tines, as the hepatic fluid, is retained, and forced out of its proper ducts, into other parts of the &s;y&s;tem, where it excites external eruptions, efflore&s;cence, or yellow|ne&s;s; in every part of the body, becoming rank poi&s;on, and &s;peedily inducing fever, morbid affections, and di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>This proce&s;s is infinitely modified by &s;ubordinate cau&s;es; as &s;ea&s;ons, which are extremely various; local exhalations and &s;tag|nant air, which are deleterious according to their force; the vari|ous modes of living, which &s;trengthen or weaken the human body; and accidental circum&s;tances, as fatigue, grief, fear, expo&s;ure to exce&s;&s;ive heat, or &s;udden cold; and innumerable &s;imilar cau&s;es.</P>
<P>This idea of the proximate cau&s;e of the bilious plague of our climate was imbibed from ob&s;ervation and conver&s;ation with phy|&s;icians, before I had read Brown's Elements of Medicin. I am happy enough to find, on reading that work, a confirmation of
<PB N="220" REF="036687_0575_100AA53A009A6370">
the opinion. That author ob&s;erves, paragraph 137. "Some|times the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els &s;eemed crammed with a colluvies of fluids, capable of producing indirect debility, as in that over|flowing of bile, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the yellow fever of the tor|rid zone."</P>
<P>This "colluvies of fluids," lodged in the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els, &s;eems to act like poi&s;on, in di&s;organizing the &s;y&s;tem. And the rea&s;on why the plague is &s;o often incurable, &s;eems to be the ra|pidity and the imperceptibility of the action of that poi&s;on, which appears totally to undermine the vital powers, before it exhibits much pain or fever. This is not its common mode of operation; but it is not unfrequent. Ca&s;es of this kind are &s;oon characterized by a total pro&s;tration of &s;trength, a cadaverous look, and a dull, gla&s;&s;y, languid eye, &s;o often de&s;cribed by med|ical writers. In &s;uch ca&s;es, debilitating remedies precipitate death; and &s;timulants are ineffectual to revive the languid func|tions.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t ca&s;es however the approaches of the di&s;ea&s;e are ac|companied with pains, unea&s;ine&s;s, and febrile &s;ymptoms, while the &s;y&s;tem yet retains its &s;tenic diathe&s;is; in &s;ome &s;uch ca&s;es, de|bilitating remedies are u&s;eful; but the rapidity of the progre&s;s of the poi&s;on &s;oon changes the diathe&s;is to a&s;tenic.</P>
<P>Boyle remarks vol. 1. 672, "that a day or two before the plague has manife&s;ted it&s;elf, in &s;ome per&s;ons, their vi&s;ion has been affected; objects appearing diver&s;ified with beautiful colors. A vomit admini&s;tered to &s;uch, u&s;ually gave relief." Every ob|&s;ervation of &s;uch eminent men de&s;erves con&s;ideration; but I do not remember to have found the &s;ame in any other author. If ju&s;t, is it not an evidence that the &s;tate of air, inducing the di&s;|ea&s;e, operates <HI>fir&s;t as a &s;timulus?</HI></P>
<P>Procopius has recorded of the plague of 543, a phenomenon &s;omewhat &s;imilar to that noticed by Boyle. He &s;ays, per&s;ons imagined they &s;aw phantoms or gho&s;ts, which made them &s;uppo&s;e they were &s;mitten by &s;ome per&s;on. Such as had this imagina|tion, &s;oon peri&s;hed with the plague.</P>
<P>In 746 al&s;o per&s;ons were troubled with phanta&s;tical images which filled them with terror. See al&s;o the plague in Carthage before Chri&s;t 404.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="036687_0576_100B2C4ED90CF6C0">General appearances favor the idea, that what is u&s;ually called an epidemic &s;tate of air, produces, in the human &s;y&s;tem, unu&s;ual excitement by exce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus.

In all epidemics of this &s;ort, a principal object of the phy&s;ician is to a&s;certain the general di|athe&s;is produced by the con&s;titution of air, and the various ef|fects of it in different bodies.

<P>The &s;econdary or auxiliary cau&s;es of plague, coming under the denomination of <HI>impure air,</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to act upon the &s;y&s;tem, by directly debilitating powers.

<P>The influence of morbid exhalations from putrefying &s;ub&s;tan|ces, is, probably to dimini&s;h the &s;timulant power of the atmo&s;|phere, inducing direct debility. The lungs receive, at every breath, a certain quantity of air; that is, about the &s;ame cubic quantity. A certain portion of this, is vital air, oxygen, which &s;erves as food for the lungs and blood, and which is &s;eparated from the re&s;t and ab&s;orbed. Whenever therefore common air is impregnated with an undue proportion of hydrogene, or with any &s;pecies of acid, which is ho&s;tile to the lungs, the&s;e vi&s;cera want their proportion of food, or &s;timulus; the con&s;equence is, their action is weakened, and the heart and arteries want their due force; the effect of which is a more feeble circulation of blood. Perhaps al&s;o the &s;eptic acid, conveyed to the blood with common air, at every in&s;piration, gradually de&s;troys its texture.</P>
<P>Sorbait mentions that a lighted candle being placed near per|&s;ons dying with the plague, a livid vapor has been &s;een, i&s;&s;uing from their mouths. Extremely vitiated mu&s;t be the air from the lungs, before it can be rendered inflammable.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the proce&s;s, we know the effects of re&s;piration in air vitiated by morbid exhalations, to be fevers of various kinds, as intermitting, remitting, dy&s;enteric, and putrid or pe&s;tilential. That &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere which I call <HI>pe&s;ti|lential,</HI> has a &s;ingular effect in increa&s;ing the irritability of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, by which means &s;lighter cau&s;es than u&s;ual occa|&s;ion dangerous inflammation.</P>
<P>Having then arrived at the probable cau&s;es of the pe&s;tilential fevers which afflict the earth, we are prepared to con&s;ider the means of prevention.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t article under this head, is, the removal of all local cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e; &s;uch as every &s;pecies of putre&s;cible &s;ub&s;tances, which, in the proce&s;s of putrefaction, emit a &s;pecies of air highly unfriendly to health. It will be ob&s;erved that I &s;peak of
<PB N="223" REF="036687_0578_100AA53FDD9E7D30">
<HI>putre&s;cible</HI> &s;ub&s;tances; for fle&s;h or vegetables, which have under|gone the proce&s;s of putrefaction, or of dige&s;tion in a healthy &s;tomach, di&s;charge little or none of the pernicious acid.</P>
<P>Hence we ob&s;erve that people in cities rely too much on clean|&s;ing &s;treets to pre&s;erve public health. Experience proves that the utmo&s;t care in clean&s;ing &s;treets will not always prevent pe&s;ti|lence. The rea&s;on is obvious; mo&s;t of the filth of &s;treets con|&s;i&s;ts of excrementitious matter from hor&s;es or oxen, which has undergone the proce&s;s mentioned, and contains no &s;eptic acid, or very little. Hence the accumulation of dung in the farmer's yard, is not known to generate di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Various other &s;ub&s;tances, thrown into the &s;treets of cities, are more pernicious; as green vegetables, the garbage of fi&s;h, lees of fermenting liquors, and many others, which, in hot weather, &s;oon putrefy and di&s;charge noxious air. Such &s;ub&s;tances how|ever never ought to be thrown into the &s;treet in hot weather; they &s;hould be thrown into the ocean, into rivers of running water, or what is better &s;till, <HI>buried,</HI> and that before putrefaction begins. If putrefaction is began, they &s;hould be removed in covered ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The vaults of cloacina, altho they contain mo&s;tly &s;ub&s;tances, which have pa&s;&s;ed through dige&s;tion, and in their unmixed &s;tate, are not <HI>very</HI> pernicious, yet they are always mixed with other &s;ub&s;tances, which, in hot weather, bring on fermentation. The&s;e &s;hould be either clean&s;ed annually in &s;pring, or the matter in them neutralized by quick-lime.</P>
<P>All filthy &s;ub&s;tances &s;hould be removed from &s;treets, both for the &s;ake of decency and of health. If the pavements of &s;treets could be covered with pure earth, it would greatly le&s;&s;en the heat; but this is not practicable. The only effectual remedy, is fre&s;h running water&mdash;the only article that unites cleanline&s;s with coolne&s;s. Nothing, in a city, can be an adequate &s;ub&s;ti|tute; for while it removes the cau&s;es of noxious vapors, and by cooling the &s;ultry air of a city, prevents debility, it extricates a con&s;iderable quantity of new and whole&s;ome air, from its own &s;ub&s;tance, and ab&s;orbs pernicious vapors.</P>
<P>Streets &s;hould al&s;o be &s;o con&s;tructed as to give the water a con|&s;iderable
<PB N="224" REF="036687_0579_100AA54224D3D370">
velocity. The practice of levelling the &s;urface of a city, is mo&s;t pernicious. If po&s;&s;ible, every &s;treet in a city &s;hould have a de&s;cent of fifteen or twenty degrees. In&s;tead of levelling the earth, the police of a city &s;hould counteract even a natural level, by throwing the whole into artificial elevations; which give a bri&s;ker currency both to water and air.</P>
<P>Cellars &s;hould be &s;o con&s;tructed, as to retain no water; and often clean&s;ed by &s;craping. If the &s;urface of the cellar can be conveniently changed, by removing a few inches of the old carth and introducing that which is fre&s;h, it would be a very &s;al|utary labor. Nothing imbibes and neutralizes infectious matter, more readily than fre&s;h earth.</P>
<P>The liberal u&s;e of water, in and about a hou&s;e, cannot be too &s;eriou&s;ly recommended. Water ab&s;orbs all noxious matter that comes in contact with it in &s;ub&s;tance. Applied to floors, wood|en, &s;tone or brick walls, to clothes, to furniture, to back-yards and &s;treets; it is every where &s;alutary in the &s;ummer months. Dr. Prie&s;tly ob&s;erves, that water purifies vitiated air, by ab&s;orb|ing the &s;eptic part. Hence its great utility as a pre&s;ervative again&s;t pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>All dead animals in a city or its vicinity, &s;hould be buried or burnt; as cats, dogs and hor&s;es. The indecency alone of &s;uf|fering their carca&s;es to putrefy before the eyes of mankind, ought to make it a &s;trict article of police, to remove them. But they &s;hould be buried; not one &s;hould be permitted to offend the eyes or no&s;trils of a citizen.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From two years ob&s;ervations, made as I pa&s;&s;ed daily from New-York to my re&s;idence in the country, I judge from twenty to thirty worn-out cart-hor&s;es die and putrefy in the &s;uburbs of that city, every year.</NOTE> They are offen&s;ive to decency, to moral &s;entiments and to health. The ancient method of burning dead bodies was well calculated to de&s;troy the poi&s;on; but in Atlantic America, burial is cheaper and equally effectual.</P>
<P>Common &s;ewers are often common nui&s;ances. In cities, all filthy &s;ub&s;tances &s;hould be conveyed off, on the vi&s;ible &s;urface of the earth, unle&s;s &s;ewers can be &s;o con&s;tructed as to depo&s;it, with certainty, all their contents in running water. Serious evils ari&s;e from putrid &s;ub&s;tances lodged in &s;ewers, that are too level, and

which &s;erve as re&s;ervoirs in&s;tead of canals, accumulating putre&s;|cible matters, in places where their exhalations, by the influence of moi&s;ture, are doubled, in&s;tead of being removed.</P>
<P>In cities, where all filth is naturally ca&s;t by rains into the docks, it would be well that all wharves &s;hould be &s;o con&s;tructed, as to pre&s;ent a &s;mooth uniform front to the &s;tream, and be ex|tended into deep water. Mud, wa&s;hed by the &s;alt tides, and not mixed with putre&s;cible matters, produces no inconvenience to health; but &s;uch matters, thrown into docks, bare at low water, and expo&s;ed to a hot &s;un, di&s;&s;olve mo&s;t rapidly, and gen|erate morbid vapors. Many improvements are yet to be made in our &s;ea-ports, which will le&s;&s;en the accumulation of perni|cious air.</P>
<P>A great and mo&s;t de&s;irable article in a &s;y&s;tem for the pre&s;erva|tion of health, is, the purifying of rooms from air which has been re&s;pired for a length of time. By experiment it is found that the air of rooms that have been &s;lept in, is very in&s;alu|brious; and probably more &s;o, than the air of privies, which is found to contain le&s;s noxious air than was formerly &s;uppo&s;ed. See Encyclopedia, art. Atmo&s;phere. Indeed, it is que&s;tionable whether there is any <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> connection between offen&s;ive &s;mells and in&s;alubrity. Nature has kindly provided that dead feces &s;hould not be very pernicious to health; but the effluvia of liv|ing and fermenting bodies are to be avoided as rank poi&s;on. In this re&s;pect cleanline&s;s is made e&s;&s;ential to health.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible in a work of this kind to enter upon the details of clean&s;ing a great commercial city. The magi&s;trates, aided by medical men, in every city, will attend to the minute regu|lations for pre&s;erving a pure air.</P>
<P>But there are other cau&s;es of autumnal di&s;ea&s;es, which mu&s;t not be overlooked.</P>
<P>It is remarked by writers that the di&s;ea&s;es from mar&s;hes and &s;tagnant waters are mo&s;t violent near their &s;ources; and gradu|ally abate in their violence and become le&s;s common, as they re|cede from tho&s;e &s;ources. See Buel on the mar&s;h fevers at Shef|field. Medical Repo&s;. vol. 1. 457. Hence, in a country gen|erally mountainous or hilly, dry and &s;alubrious, but containing
<PB N="226" REF="036687_0581_100AA54654327C88">
here and there a pond of dead water or mar&s;h, the bilious fevers generated by the effluvia, will be local, rarely extending beyond one mile and a half from their &s;ource.</P>
<P>But there are &s;ome exten&s;ive mar&s;hes, which may produce ef|fects to a much greater di&s;tance. Such are the low grounds in Hungary, a &s;ickly region; the pontine mar&s;hes near Naples, which may affect the health of people in Rome; the flat lands and rice plantations in Bengal on the Ganges&mdash;the coa&s;t of Ter|ra Firma in South-America, and the mar&s;hes from E. Florida to the Delaware in North America. The fevers of Cambridge, Ely and Lincoln&s;hire in England, may be cla&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e above mentioned; but are of &s;maller extent.</P>
<P>It is an opinion in Con&s;tantinople that the frequency of the plague in that city, is to be attributed to the northerly winds, which come from the mar&s;hes of Tartary and Ru&s;&s;ia, bordering on the Euxine, &s;weeping that &s;ea, and conveying moi&s;ture and noxious exhalations.</P>
<P>The po&s;ition of that city is otherwi&s;e a very healthy one&mdash;the climate is temperate&mdash;the &s;ite of the city, high, dry and ri&s;ing into hills and mountains on the we&s;t. No cau&s;e of unu&s;ual di&s;|ea&s;es can be found in the neighborhood. The cau&s;es within the city, are powerful. Many of the &s;treets are narrow, filthy, crou|ded, and almo&s;t ob&s;tructed by pent-hou&s;es. But in this re&s;pect, Con&s;tantinople is not wor&s;e than one half the cities of Europe. Shall we then admit that winds will convey morbid exhalations, &s;everal hundred miles, without di&s;&s;ipating them, &s;o as to render them innoxious? Let us attend to other facts.</P>
<P>No city in Europe, except Con&s;tantinople, has been more fre|quently de&s;olated by plagues, than Rome, from the time of Rom|ulus to the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century. Shall we a&s;cribe this, to the va&s;t mar&s;hes which border the &s;hore from the mouths of the Tiber to Naples? Certain it is, that Rome has ever been con&s;id|ered, as a very unhealthy city; and the terrible plagues which ravaged it, when in the utmo&s;t pro&s;perity, as well as in modern times, ju&s;tify this opinion. So &s;en&s;ible have the inhabitants been of the prevalence of this opinion abroad, and the ill-effects of it in preventing &s;trangers from re&s;orting to the city, that Lanci&s;ius,
<PB N="227" REF="036687_0582_100AA5496134B3B0">
an eminent phy&s;ician of the pre&s;ent century, wrote a con&s;iderable treati&s;e, evidently with a view to remove this opinion.</P>
<P>This author ob&s;erves, that &s;outh winds at Rome, if violent, humid, with clouds and heat, produce inconvenience, and if they pa&s;s over mar&s;h, they may bring "particulas lethiferas," ve|ry pernicious vapors, which produce pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The Romans very early took mea&s;ures to correct the evils to which the city was expo&s;ed. The enormous cloacae, or &s;ew|ers were rai&s;ed at a va&s;t expen&s;e, to carry off all &s;tagnant water, and dry the &s;oil, and while kept clean, were very u&s;eful. Hence cloacina was deified as the godde&s;s of health. The&s;e &s;ewers were under the care of certain officers, called "Curatores Cloa|carum Urbis." In one in&s;tance, the&s;e drains had been a long time neglected, and were clean&s;ed at the expen&s;e of a thou&s;and talents. Severe laws were enacted, prohibiting individuals, un|der penalty of a fine, to &s;uffer water to &s;tagnate.</P>
<P>Lanci&s;ius a&s;cribes the &s;evere di&s;ea&s;es which afflicted Rome, in the decline of the Empire, to the de&s;truction of the aqueducts and neglect of the &s;ewers. In 1695, when the ditch of Adri|an's tower, and the great &s;ewer of the city Leoninae, were filled with filth, immediately on the blowing of the &s;outh wind, began pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es. By order of the Pope, at this author's &s;ug|ge&s;tion, the &s;treets, vaults, ditches and all &s;imilar places, were thoroughly clean&s;ed, and ten years after, no epidemic malignant di&s;ea&s;e had appeared. He however ob&s;erves that when a &s;outh wind blows for <HI>a long time,</HI> acute fevers, tertians, pains in the head, and vertigo become epidemic. This mu&s;t be occa&s;ioned by the debilitating effects of that wind, or by mia&s;mata convey|ed from a di&s;tance, probably from the pontine mar&s;hes.</P>

<P>Egypt is a flat country, containing not much mar&s;h, but annual|ly overflowed, and &s;ubject to mo&s;t of the inconveniences of mar&s;hy countries, from the drying of its moi&s;t &s;urface, in very hot weather. Here again we have a nur&s;ery of pe&s;tilence.</P>

The low &s;wampy lands that border all the rivers, in the flat country of Maryland, Virginia and the Carolinas, and the immen&s;e tract of bog in Virginia called the <HI>di&s;mal?</HI> The effects of them on the neighboring inhabitants are well known&mdash;annual and almo&s;t univer&s;al intermittents, and often, remittents.</P>
<P>Is it not po&s;&s;ible and probable, that the noxious exhalations from the&s;e va&s;t hot-beds of putrefaction, are borne on the &s;outh-we&s;terly winds, which prevail almo&s;t con&s;tantly in June, July and Augu&s;t, and which run parallel with the general trending of the coa&s;t, from Florida to New-York? Do they not impregnate the whole atmo&s;phere for a con&s;iderable breadth, and &s;weep the country, from the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Che&s;apeek to Philadel|phia, New-Jer&s;ey, and in a &s;lighter degree, to New-York? I do not give a po&s;itive opinion on this &s;ubject; but the annual prevalence of flight intermittents on York-I&s;land, and in the city, tho far removed from any mar&s;h, and continually ventilated by &s;ea breezes, as well as wa&s;hed by rapid tides, affords &s;ome ground to believe this &s;ugge&s;tion.</P>
<P>It is confirmatory of this idea, that &s;oon after leaving York-I&s;land towards the ea&s;t, all intermittents di&s;appear; unle&s;s in a very few places, where they proceed from obvious local cau&s;es: Now it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the coa&s;t of the United States, runs generally from &s;outh-we&s;t to north-ea&s;t; but at New-York, it takes a different cour&s;e, and runs about ea&s;t by north, for two hundred miles. This cour&s;e &s;oon carries the people on the &s;hore, beyond the reach of the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tream of morbid vapor, from the &s;outhern mar&s;hes, who&s;e cour&s;e is with the &s;outh we&s;terly winds.</P>
<P>I am not attached to this idea; but it is in conformity with the opinion of the in&s;alubrity of the Euxine winds at Con&s;tan|tinople; and with the effects of the &s;outherly Calabrian wind, blowing over the pontine mar&s;hes, towards Rome. Lanci&s;ius relates a remarkable fact. Thirty gentlemen and ladies went on a party of plea&s;ure, towards the mouth of the Tiber. The wind &s;hifted &s;uddenly, and blew from the mar&s;hes, "paludes o&s;tien&s;es," and twenty-nine of them were immediately &s;eized with a tertian. If &s;uch was the effect of the vapors from tho&s;e

mar&s;hes, we may &s;uppo&s;e the va&s;t pontine mar&s;h would poi&s;on the air to a much greater di&s;tance.</P>
<P>That the exten&s;ive mora&s;&s;es, along our &s;outhern &s;hore, are pregnant with mi&s;chief to that country is certain; that the peo|ple of Philadelphia and New-York are affected by them, may be po&s;&s;ible. It would therefore de&s;erve con&s;ideration, whether the evil will admit of a remedy. There are two modes of ren|dering mar&s;hy lands and &s;tagnating water &s;alub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s&mdash;one, by draining the lands and cultivating them; the other by turning into them &s;treams of running water. It is probable that mo&s;t of the mar&s;h at the &s;outhward, being within reach of tides, and below high water, is incapable of being drained. It is the pon|tine region of North-America. How far the &s;econd plan can be applied with &s;ucce&s;s, I have not the local knowledge of the land and rivers to determin. The cla&s;&s;ic reader will recollect the in&s;tance, related in hi&s;tory of Empedocles, the Sicilian phi|lo&s;opher and poet, who put an end to pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, a|mong the Saliuntii, by turning two &s;treams of good water into the mar&s;hes, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om which they originated.</P>
<P>If there is a po&s;&s;ibility of drying any of the lands, now cov|ered with poi&s;on, or of putting the dead water into motion, the United States have a va&s;t intere&s;t in effecting that object; and expen&s;es are not to be put in competition with the health and lives of our citizens.</P>
<P>The &s;ame remark is applicable to all the mar&s;hes in other parts of the country, as about &s;ome of the lakes; and to all &s;maller &s;ources of di&s;ea&s;e, &s;wamps and ponds. In every po&s;&s;ible &s;ituation, where &s;tagnant water contains vegetable &s;ub&s;tances in abundance, di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t prevail. Running water, on the other hand, is &s;alubrious. It not only does not exhale morbid air, but it generates fre&s;h and pure air; at the &s;ame time, it creates a gentle breeze by its current, which helps to di&s;&s;ipate any nox|ious particles in its neighborhood which may ari&s;e from other &s;ources.</P>
<P>People in the country cannot be too careful in &s;electing a &s;pot for their habitation. The que&s;tion, of continued health or di&s;|ea&s;e, of long life or premature death, hangs very often upon the choice of a &s;alubrious &s;ituation for a hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="036687_0585_100AA54FC5826298">A farmer &s;hould never plant his dwelling by the &s;ide of a mar&s;h. Whatever may be the &s;ituation of his lands, he is inex|cu&s;eable, if he builds his man&s;ion within a mile of the &s;ources of di&s;ea&s;e and death. Better for him to go a mile and a half to his daily labor, enjoying robu&s;t health, than to live within the circulation of poi&s;onous vapors, afflicted by di&s;ea&s;es for three months in the year. And when a farmer has the misfortune to be obliged to labor occa&s;ionally in the vicinity of &s;tagnant water, he &s;hould be careful not to enter upon the ground early in the morning, before the noxious vapors have been rai&s;ed and attenu|ated by the heat of the &s;un, nor &s;hould he continue there, till late in the evening.</P>
<P>People in the country &s;hould &s;elect hilly or elevated po&s;itions for their hou&s;es; where the &s;urface of the earth is dry, and there is a free circulation of pure air. There is another rea&s;on &mdash;the water on high grounds is always better than in low, &s;wampy places. Water in flat lands &s;tagnates beneath the &s;urface, as well as above; but on hills, it is in con&s;tant motion. Hence if men expect good water they mu&s;t &s;eek for it on mountains, hills and ri&s;ing grounds. The Arabians advi&s;e that hou&s;es &s;hould be &s;et on high, airy places, near fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>When a choice of difficulties occurs, and men are compelled to live near mar&s;h, they &s;hould endeavor to place their dwelling on the windward &s;ide of the mar&s;h, which, in America, is the &s;outh and we&s;t; the &s;ummer winds being from the&s;e points.

<P>The fables of antiquity are mo&s;tly ob&s;cure and not well under|&s;tood by the moderns; but &s;ome of them are ea&s;ily explained, and contain mo&s;t excellent le&s;&s;ons. The &s;tory of Python, the huge &s;erpent, which alarmed and infe&s;ted the world, until he was &s;lain by Apollo, is of this kind. Python was generated by the action of heat on the mud and &s;lime, which covered the earth, after the rece&s;s of the water of Ducalion's flood. That is, Python was di&s;ea&s;e, proceeding from noxious exhalations, in hot &s;ea&s;ons, which was de&s;troyed by Apollo, the &s;un, which dried and puri|fied the earth. See Ovid, Metam. lib. 1.

This I mu&s;t believe; but the fact affords no ground of complaint again&s;t providence; for the &s;ame fate has attended all other &s;pecies of animals. The hor&s;e, the ox, the &s;heep, the dog, the cat, the fowls, and the fi&s;h, are &s;ubject to the &s;ame univer&s;al law of the phy&s;ical world; and on what prin|ciple will man arraign this di&s;po&s;ition of all created life, or claim an exemption from the laws, to which all other &s;pecies of animals are &s;ubjected?</P>
<P>But we are not altogether without hope, even in the de&s;perate circum&s;tances mentioned. If we attend to the cau&s;es of plagues, we &s;hall find they all tend to de&s;troy life by <HI>one general ef|fect,</HI> which is, <HI>debility.</HI> Either directly or indirectly, all the ex|citing cau&s;es clo&s;e their operation on the &s;y&s;tem, by inducing <HI>de|bility,</HI> leaving the nerves, mu&s;cles, and inte&s;tines in a relaxed, languid &s;tate.</P>
<P>If this principle is ju&s;t, and it is agreeable to the medical idea that debility is the cau&s;e of all fevers, we have a clue that will lead us to the means of e&s;caping the evils of pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>In the morbid &s;tate of air, producing the uncontrollable pe&s;ti|lences, which have a&s;&s;ailed man in the healthie&s;t &s;ituations on the
<PB N="232" REF="036687_0587_100AA554D470F8A0">
globe, we ob&s;erve that the mo&s;t terrible effects have been pro|duced, in &s;ea&s;ons, when the air has been warm, humid, une|la&s;tic, with light &s;outherly breezes; as in the reign of M. Au|relius, of Gallienus, and of Edward III. This &s;tate of the air &s;erved very much to aid the pe&s;tilential principle, in debilitat|ing the human body. All local cau&s;es probably tend to the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>The great de&s;ideratum then is, how to counteract the debili|itating operation of the&s;e cau&s;es, and <HI>pre&s;erve the tone of the &s;y&s;|tem.</HI> I am per&s;uaded that all the means of prevention are com|pri&s;ed in that idea. No man is taken ill with this furious di&s;ea&s;e, until his nervous &s;y&s;tem and his inte&s;tines cea&s;e to perform their u&s;ual functions, and &s;ecretions are &s;u&s;pended or dimini&s;hed. Hence per&s;ons, as long as their evacuations are regular, may walk with &s;afety in the mo&s;t infected places, until their eyes and their color exhibit the poi&s;on that is imbibed; yet they will not &s;uffer by the di&s;ea&s;e, while the ve&s;&s;els have &s;trength to di&s;charge the morbid matter by regular &s;ecretions and evacuations. This is a known and a common fact.</P>
<P>Hence &s;ome per&s;ons and even phy&s;icians have re&s;orted, du|ring the plague, to &s;mall do&s;es of calomel, or other purgative, to keep open bowels. A mo&s;t pernicious practice to tho&s;e in health, for it induces the very evil meant to be avoided, <HI>debility;</HI> and ultimately, the inte&s;tines becoming unable to perform their functions, di&s;ea&s;e and death en&s;ue. I am well informed of a number of ca&s;es of this kind, in New-York, the la&s;t &s;ummer, which ended in death.</P>
<P>The <HI>true means</HI> to pre&s;erve the natural tone of the body, are the <HI>mo&s;t natural means.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Food is the natural &s;timulus of the &s;y&s;tem. During pe&s;tilence therefore this article demands the fir&s;t notice. It is agreed by all writers, and ob&s;ervation ju&s;tifies the opinion, that temperance is e&s;&s;ential to health, during a &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on. Some per&s;ons, mi&s;taking temperance for ab&s;tinence, have run into an extreme of ab&s;tinence, which has been fatal to them. The true point to be ob&s;erved, is, to take as much food and drink, as will &s;u&s;tain the body in its u&s;ual degree of &s;trength; without
<PB N="233" REF="036687_0588_100AA556858B3850">
overcharging it with &s;timulus. Too much food produces unu&s;ual excitement, which is followed by indirect debility, a &s;tate of body which invites an attack of pe&s;tilence. Too little nouri&s;h|ment, on the other hand, induces direct debility, a &s;tate equally favorable to di&s;ea&s;e. I have good grounds for believing &s;ome very valuable citizens of New-York, of my acquaintance, fell &s;acrifices to their exce&s;s of caution in the u&s;e of food, during the la&s;t epidemic.</P>
<P>It is not improbable that different con&s;titutions of air, as they produce various &s;ymptoms in the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es, may require or admit of very different degrees of &s;timulus, applied to the hu|man body. The epidemic in New-York in 1795, like that in Philadelphia in 1793, was characterized with inflammatory di|athe&s;is, more frequently than in 1798. Hence vene&s;ection, which had acquired great celebrity in 1793, lo&s;t part of its credit, in 1798, and was u&s;ed with more di&s;crimination and caution.</P>
<P>I &s;u&s;pect the &s;ame circum&s;tance has changed or modified the opinion of the great utility of ab&s;taining from generous diet and liquors. This opinion was general and well received in 1795; nor have any ca&s;es come to my knowledge, in which the practice was &s;uppo&s;ed to be injurious. But in 1798, many in&s;tances oc|curred where per&s;ons of the mo&s;t &s;lender habits, of &s;trict ab&s;ti|nence from &s;timulating diet, and who weakened the &s;y&s;tem by purges, were &s;eized with uncommon violence by the pe&s;tilence, and peri&s;hed. On the contrary, I am acquainted with &s;everal phy&s;icians, who took their u&s;ual quantity of food, with &s;ome wine and more than their cu&s;tomary quantity of porter, who at|tended the &s;ick, thro the &s;ea&s;on, vi&s;iting the mo&s;t infected places, without &s;uffering the lea&s;t inconvenience to their health.</P>
<P>If the point is admitted that debility is the great proximate cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e, which I think cannot be conte&s;ted, the con&s;equence is plain, that whatever tends to reduce the vigor of the &s;y&s;tem below its u&s;ual &s;tandard, mu&s;t be prejudicial, during its prevalence. Hence the propriety of rather increa&s;ing than le&s;|&s;ening the u&s;ual quantity of food, or natural &s;timulus; carefully avoiding, at the &s;ame time, all exce&s;s in eating or drinking, which is equally dangerous.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="036687_0589_100AA5581EE3F198">Another thing to be ob&s;erved, in &s;ummer, and e&s;pecially in time of pe&s;tilence, is, the guarding the body, but by all means, the head, from the direct rays of the &s;un. Nothing is more dange|rous than the burning heat of a clear &s;un, in &s;ultry weather. It often produces &s;udden death, by means of an apoplexy, in&s;tan|ces of which are related under the year 1752, to have happened at Charle&s;ton; and the &s;ame is &s;aid to have taken place there, the &s;ummer pa&s;t. In other ca&s;es, the effect is, what is called a &s;troke of the &s;un, "coup du &s;oleil," which is not always fatal, but very dangerous.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t general ill-effect of expo&s;ure to a hot &s;un, is, great debility, in con&s;equence of the violent and unnatuaral ex|citement; and this effect is mo&s;t to be found in the nervous &s;y&s;|tem, when the heat has fallen directly on the head. Convale&s;|cents from bilious fevers have occa&s;ion to be particularly cautious, not to to expo&s;e them&s;elves to a hot &s;un; a relap&s;e is the mo&s;t certain con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The umbrella is an excellent invention; it would be &s;till more excellent, if it could be improved, &s;o as to render the &s;hade more general, and completely interrupt the rays of the &s;un, with|out being rendered too heavy.</P>
<P>In walking the &s;treets of a city, in a clear hot day, the pa&s;&s;en|ger will naturally &s;eek the &s;hady &s;ide. Of &s;o much importance is it thought, in &s;ome hot countries, to &s;hield the body from the rays of the &s;un, that very di&s;cerning men contend that narrow &s;treets and high hou&s;es, in cities, contribute to the health of the citizens, by mitigating the heat. They &s;uppo&s;e the ob&s;truction of air a le&s;s evil, than a hot &s;un. Of this opinion was Lan|ci&s;ius.</P>
<P>But this is to embrace one evil, in &s;hunning another. It is to be regretted that the be&s;t mode of &s;hielding man from a hot &s;un, is not adopted in cities. Wide &s;treets, bordered with rows of trees, would be infinitely preferable to all the artificial &s;hades that can be invented. Trees are the coolers given to us by nature. They make a plea&s;ant &s;hade&mdash;they imbibe the &s;eptic fluids, which impregnate the atmo&s;phere of cities, and poi&s;on their in|habitants &mdash;they exhale pure air&mdash;they fan the earth, by creating
<PB N="235" REF="036687_0590_100AA55AC92EF3C0">
or augmenting currents of air, with the vibratory movement of their leaves&mdash;they invite the feathered tribe to light on their branch|es, and with the mu&s;ic of their notes, to relieve the ear from the grating of rough, unnatural &s;ounds, which &s;tun the citizen.</P>
<P>It has been objected to trees, that they increa&s;e the danger of fire, by ob&s;tructing the free u&s;e of engines. This objection is im|aginary. Few ca&s;es would occur, where trees, properly placed, could interfere with the operations of extingui&s;hing fire; and in &s;uch ca&s;es, they might be levelled in a moment.</P>
<P>It has al&s;o been objected, that trees ob&s;truct the free circulation of air. This is not true. In calm &s;ummer weather, they very much increa&s;e a light breeze, by partly ob&s;tructing the upper cur|rent with their branches, and throwing more air below, thus augmenting the under current on the &s;urface of the earth, where it is wanted. The leaves and branches al&s;o, by their gentle mo|tion, agitate the air, preventing the ill effects of &s;tagnation; and give velocity to the air that finds its way through their inter&s;tices.</P>
<P>"The &s;treets and public &s;quares of a city, &s;ays St. Pierre, &s;hould be planted with great trees of various &s;orts. A city, built of marble, would to me have a melancholy appearance, unle&s;s I could &s;ee in it trees and verdure."</P>
<BIBL>Studies of Nature, 13.</BIBL>
<P>Trees and all green vegetables dimini&s;h greatly the heat near the earth; and little do men in general think, how prejudicial to health is the operation of the extreme heat of cities.</P>
<P>It is not an uncommon thing in the country, where no mia&s;|mata exi&s;t, for laboring men to over heat them&s;elves in the field, and die in &s;ix days, with a bilious fever; their bodies as yellow as &s;affron. This is yellow fever of a mild kind, generated in the &s;y&s;tem, by the debility occa&s;ioned by exce&s;&s;ive heat and fa|tigue, without any external cau&s;e. Thus the extreme heat of Augu&s;t and September 1798 will alone account for the unu&s;ual violence and extent of the pe&s;tilential fever of that year.</P>
<P>In the warm &s;ea&s;on, and e&s;pecially in time of epidemic fevers, people &s;hould be doubly cautious not to expo&s;e their health by ex|ce&s;&s;ive fatigue. Labor &s;hould not be violent, and walking, mod|erate. In extreme heat, the natural excitement of the &s;y&s;tem, is u&s;ually too great; and a &s;mall addition to it throws the body
<PB N="236" REF="036687_0591_100AA55D971921B8">
into a &s;tate of debility which invites di&s;ea&s;e. Not only health, but life, is often &s;u&s;pended on the point of half an hour's exer|ci&s;e. Temperance in labor, bodily or mental, is as e&s;&s;ential to good health, as in eating or drinking. The mu&s;cles and the nerves, tho&s;e moving powers of the human body, if &s;timulated beyond a certain point, lo&s;e their excitability beyond the po&s;&s;i|bility of recovery.</P>
<P>The danger incurred by &s;edentary and &s;tudious men, during pe&s;tilence, from the debilitating effects of their occupations, is greatly increa&s;ed. Want of due exerci&s;e is directly relaxing to the &s;olids; while application of the mind is apt to over-excite the nerves and induce indirect debility. The extreme irritabil|ity of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, is obvious in a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air. &mdash;I experienced it mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly in the &s;ummer of 1795, during the fever in New-York; and it is evidenced in the vertigo, &s;o frequent at &s;uch times; in the &s;eizure of many per&s;ons in the plague with apoplectic &s;ymptoms; and in the pal&s;ies and apo|plexies which are greatly multiplied before or after the preva|lence of a pe&s;tilence, and which in &s;ome places, have become almo&s;t epidemic.</P>
<P>During the rage of epidemic pe&s;tilence, al&s;o the animal ap|petite &s;hould be indulged with moderation&mdash;exce&s;&s;ive indulgence, which might have been &s;u&s;tained at other times, has often hur|ried the young and &s;prightly, to a premature grave. Nothing can be more dangerous, according to all medical writers on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Cel&s;us directs that in pe&s;tilence, per&s;ons &s;hould &s;eek fre&s;h air, travel, &s;ail; or if the&s;e are not convenient, they &s;hould avoid fatigue, indige&s;tion, cold, heat, exce&s;&s;ive indulgence of the an|imal de&s;ires; e&s;pecially &s;ays the author, in a pe&s;tilence which is occa&s;ioned by &s;outherly winds. Vol. 1. 40, 41.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations are not new; they are common and well known to medical men, and to all others of di&s;cernment. They are here in&s;erted, becau&s;e th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y may be, in this work, more gen|erally read, than in medical books, which are opened only by profe&s;&s;ional men.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="036687_0592_100AA55F1E541D48">But all the&s;e rules, if &s;trictly ob&s;erved, will not, in a more violent plague, be &s;ufficient to &s;ecure the body from attack. Such are the extremely debilitating qualities of the air, in &s;ome periods, that it will be nece&s;&s;ary to counteract them by artificial powers po&s;itively tonic.</P>
<P>The application for this purpo&s;e, which is mo&s;t ea&s;y and ef|fectual, is <HI>water;</HI> an article which nature has furni&s;hed in the greate&s;t abundance, becau&s;e it is far the mo&s;t u&s;eful. On this &s;ubject perhaps &s;ome of the following ideas may not be very common.</P>
<P>My attention to water, as a preventative of pe&s;tilence, was fir&s;t excited by a pa&s;&s;age in Volney's Travels in Egypt and Syria, chap. 17. where he informs us in a note that "at Cairo, it is ob&s;erved, the water-carriers, continually wet with the fre&s;h wa|ter they carry in &s;kins upon their backs, are never &s;ubject to the plague."&mdash;The author is there &s;peaking of the pernicious effects of humidity on health; but the e&s;cape of the water-carriers, he a&s;cribes to <HI>lotion,</HI> who&s;e effects are different from tho&s;e of moi&s;|ture by vapor.</P>
<P>If this fact is accurately &s;tated, it is worth an empire. I am inclined to believe it and to a&s;cribe the e&s;cape of tho&s;e men to the con&s;tant application of water to their bodies, during the la|bors of the day. Yet if true, why have not authors propagated the knowlege of &s;o important a truth, to every part of the world? Is this neglect al&s;o the fruit of the pernicious errors re&s;|pecting the exclu&s;ive origin of the plague from infection? The calamities &s;u&s;tained by mankind, in con&s;equence of tho&s;e errors, exceed all calculation.</P>
<P>How is it po&s;&s;ible, that, if a remedy for the calamity of pe&s;|tilence, is &s;o obvious and &s;o near at hand, the Egyptians &s;hould not have applied it univer&s;ally? Can this be a&s;cribed to the doc|trin of prede&s;tination, which makes them carele&s;s of the means of prevention?</P>
<P>It is very certain that the laws of Mo&s;es, re&s;pecting the pro|hibition of blood, fat, &s;wine's fle&s;h, and certain other animals; as al&s;o the whole &s;y&s;tem of ablutions, purifications, and u&s;e of perfumes, were intended to correct the evils of the climate; and
<PB N="238" REF="036687_0593_100AA561E0881830">
many of his directions became totally u&s;ele&s;s, when the I&s;raelites left that country and its vicinity. Heaven never could intend &s;ome of the provi&s;ions of the Mo&s;aic code, for more temperate and healthy climates.</P>
<P>The ancient Egyptians had &s;imilar practices, and probably long before the days of Mo&s;es. Their laws and cu&s;toms to en|&s;ure cleanline&s;s were very &s;trict, and they involved a mo&s;t liberal u&s;e of water. Herodotus expre&s;sly declares that "they &s;cour their cups, wa&s;h their linen, and <HI>circumci&s;e for the &s;ake of clean|line&s;s.</HI> The prie&s;ts bathe twice by day and twice by night, and are obliged to wear linen." Swine's fle&s;h was al&s;o con&s;idered to be unclean and prohibited as an article of food.</P>
<BIBL>See Book 2. Euterpe.</BIBL>
<P>The&s;e regulations doubtle&s;s proceeded from the experience of their good effects. It is not improbable that the introduction of the Mahometan religion, may have been accompanied with the abolition or di&s;u&s;e of ancient practices, which were friendly to health. Certain it is, that the oriental nations make great u&s;e of baths; the original de&s;ign of which was probably to guard a|gain&s;t di&s;ea&s;es, but which have been abu&s;ed and converted to the purpo&s;es of luxury.</P>
<P>Let us then pur&s;ue the idea of applying water as a panoply again&s;t the attacks of pe&s;tilence. By what means does water guard the body from that di&s;ea&s;e?</P>
<P>I have already quoted the ob&s;ervation of Dr. Prie&s;tley, to prove that water ab&s;orbs the &s;eptic acid. If this opinion is well founded, and I have no doubt of it, we have obtained a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential item of knowlege. Fre&s;h water frequently applied to the body receives and carries off all the matter of infection, thus removing <HI>one</HI> copious &s;ource of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Savary remarks, that pe&s;tiferous matter, pa&s;&s;ed through wa|ter, will not communicate the di&s;temper. This is a confirma|tion of Dr. Prie&s;tley's principles.</P>
<P>The ce&s;&s;ation of the plague in Egypt, on the inundation of the Nile, is no &s;mall evidence of the &s;ame principle. The wa|ter changes the &s;tate of the air, both by ab&s;orption, that is, im|bibing and carrying off the pe&s;tiferous &s;ources of vapor from the earth; and by extricating a quantity of fre&s;h air. And this
<PB N="239" REF="036687_0594_100AA5640F87E420">
important fact directs to the mode by which all gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cities are to prevent or le&s;&s;en the force of this di&s;ea&s;e. What the Nile does once a year for Egypt, fre&s;h &s;treams of water &s;hould do every day, in the hot &s;ea&s;on, for all large towns&mdash;they <HI>&s;hould inundate the &s;treets.</HI> Nature has given, in Egypt, the mo&s;t an|cient and the mo&s;t common nur&s;ery of the plague, the <HI>model</HI> of the be&s;t remedy for the &s;evere&s;t calamity incident to man; a model which few cities have been wi&s;e enough to copy.</P>
<P>But it will not be &s;ufficient to tru&s;t wholly to the effect of a diffu&s;ion of water over a city. In the hot &s;ea&s;on, it &s;hould be applied to the body very frequently in the way of lotion or bath|ing. By this I do not mean to recommend the practice of leap|ing into river or &s;ea-water, and continuing in it for half an hour &mdash;a practice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich proves fatal to many lives every &s;ummer. Cold water is the mo&s;t powerfully debilitating application, that can be made to the body. No per&s;ons can bear it, even in &s;ummer, but the healthy and robu&s;t; and to &s;ave &s;uch from injury, it mu&s;t not be applied when the body is over-heated, or continued too long. Many&mdash;many in&s;tances occur every year, in which a fa|tal yellow fever is &s;peedily induced by injudicious plunging. An in&s;tantaneous application of cool water to the body, by a &s;ingle plunge, or by a &s;hower bath, &s;ometimes acts as a &s;timulant, by a &s;udden increa&s;e of excitability in the &s;y&s;tem; but this &s;hould be u&s;ed as a remedy, under the direction of a phy&s;ician. Few per|&s;ons can &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock, unle&s;s in good health; and I am per|&s;uaded it would be as well for mankind, if the u&s;e of cold wa|ter by plunging, were wholly pro&s;cribed. Judiciou&s;ly applied, it is &s;ometimes u&s;eful; but my own ob&s;ervations lead me to be|lieve, the utility is more than overbalanced by its fatal or mi&s;|chievous effects.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;afe, ea&s;y, plea&s;ant and beneficial mode of u&s;ing water, is, to bathe or wa&s;h the body in a private apartment at home. This may be done in &s;everal ways&mdash;either in a large ve&s;|&s;el immer&s;ing the whole body at once; or, what is le&s;s trouble|&s;ome, with a &s;ingle pail or bowl of water, in a bed chamber. The wa&s;hing may be done with the hand, or a &s;ponge, in a few minutes, as the per&s;on ri&s;es in the morning or retires, at night.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="036687_0595_100AA5665EABCA98">The temperature of the wate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> near that of the blood; a little cooler or a little warmer, and in &s;uch a temperature, it is a plea&s;ant application, occa&s;ioning no violence to the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>It may not be obvious to every common reader, that the ap|plication of warm water to the &s;urface of the body, in a hot day, &s;hould cool it. But &s;uch is the fact, and nature points out this mode of reducing the heat of the body, by the proce&s;s of per&s;|piration. In this proce&s;s, the in&s;en&s;ible vapor, which e&s;capes by the per&s;piratory ducts, takes with it a portion of heat&mdash;and the more freely a per&s;on per&s;pires, the more temperate, the heat of his body. Hence the human body is enabled to &s;u&s;tain heat, &s;everal degrees above that of the blood&mdash;and hence the fle&s;h of a child, in full health per&s;piring freely, feels cooler than the air, in a &s;ummer's day. This phenomenon may be illu&s;trated by a thermometer, with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e. Immer&s;e the bulb into warm water, in a hot day. Let the water be of 75 degrees of heat and the air, of 80 degrees. The thermometer, &s;tanding at 75 deg. in the water, and taken out into a warmer medium, the air, ought to ri&s;e to 80 deg. but being wet, the evaporation will &s;ink the mercury four or five degrees; that is to about 70 deg. until the in&s;trument is dry, when it will ri&s;e to 80 deg. the temperature of the air.</P>
<P>On this principle warm water, as well as cool, will le&s;&s;en the heat of the &s;y&s;tem; for no &s;ooner does a per&s;on cea&s;e to apply the water, than evaporation commences and cools the body by &s;everal degrees. This effect however is temporary, in con&s;e|quence of the &s;timulus of the heat.</P>
<P>In very hot weather it is better, e&s;pecially for <HI>per&s;ons in the vigor of health,</HI> to u&s;e water a little cooler, than the blood; for the effect of warm water, applied in the manner propo&s;ed, is to &s;timulate&mdash;and this is not what the body requires. On the con|trary, when highly excited by the heat of the air, the body re|quires a reduction of heat, to prevent over-excitement, and its effect, indirect debility. In general then the body in &s;ummer is to be cooled by the u&s;e of water, while in a healthy &s;tate; but if debility or di&s;ea&s;e has invaded it, it requires heat and excite|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="036687_0596_100AA567E543B410">Per&s;ons of a <HI>&s;lender habit,</HI> who require additional &s;timulus, &s;hould u&s;e water a little warmer than the blood. The effect of cool water applied to per&s;ons in full health, and of warm water, to feeble habits, is the &s;ame; to <HI>prevent debility; indirect</HI> in the former ca&s;e, and <HI>direct,</HI> in the latter.</P>
<P>Bathing a long time in very warm water, to produce profu&s;e per&s;piration, is a powerful laxative; and perhaps it would be bet|ter, if it was never u&s;ed, except as a remedy for di&s;ea&s;e, under the direction of phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>The beneficial effects of the u&s;e of water, in pe&s;tilence, there|fore, are the&s;e.&mdash;The poi&s;onous particles compo&s;ing infection, and exhalations of all kinds, are wa&s;hed from the body, and their ill effects prevented&mdash;the morbid matter exhaled from the body by the per&s;piratory ve&s;&s;els, is al&s;o removed&mdash;an effect that may be aided by frequent changes of clean linen &mdash;The extreme ve&s;&s;els are &s;timulated and clean&s;ed, by which means they are enabled to carry on more perfectly the excretions; per&s;piration being one of the principal re&s;ources of nature to expel the poi&s;on which enkindles the flame of pe&s;tilence.&mdash;The whole &s;y&s;tem is kept in equilibrio, by a diminution of excitement, in the robu&s;t, and an increa&s;e of it, in the debilitated; the con&s;equence is, the &s;y&s;|tem is daily renewing its tone and vigor, the energy of the brain is pre&s;erved, the mu&s;cular fibres retain their powers, and all the functions of the body, the dige&s;tion, circulation, &s;ecretions, and evacuations, are regularly performed.</P>
<P>Medical gentlemen will excu&s;e me for the&s;e ideas, which be|long more properly to their province. They are not new to that de&s;cription of citizens; but, if ju&s;t, they ought to be univer&s;al|ly known; for they lay the be&s;t foundation for a regular plan of economy, in dome&s;tic life, which will greatly alleviate the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of autumnal epidemics. I cannot help thinking that man|kind are yet in their infancy, in this re&s;pect; and that in general they under&s;tand the true art of living, which &s;hall &s;ecure health and happine&s;s, as little as they under&s;tood agriculture or naval architecture, in the days of Henry the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded that the whole art of &s;ecuring our&s;elves from

pe&s;tilence, as I have before remarked, con&s;i&s;ts in this &s;imple maxim&mdash;"pre&s;erve the natural energy of the &s;y&s;tem." That water, fre&s;h and pure, is the in&s;trument mo&s;t efficacious for this purpo&s;e, I mu&s;t believe, from rea&s;on and experiment. The fact related by Volney of the e&s;cape of the water-carriers, is of infi|nite weight, if fairly &s;tated; and demands immediate applica|tion to our own ca&s;e. At any rate, it demands inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>I have other proof of the &s;ucce&s;s of water, u&s;ed as I have pre&s;cribed. A friend of mine, who has lived many years in the We&s;t-Indies, who has &s;een the yellow fever in all its forms, who has tended the &s;ick in that climate and in New-York, expo&s;ed him&s;elf to their breath and effluvia for days and nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly and &s;lept with his own &s;on, when on his death-bed, with that di&s;ea&s;e, has hitherto e&s;caped the infection. He a&s;cribes this im|punity to a daily u&s;e of water in the manner abovementioned.</P>
<P>We are not to calculate on the univer&s;al and invariable &s;ucce&s;s of any remedy for this terrible calamity. Multitudes of men will not take the pains to u&s;e the means nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;i&s;t the ef|fects of the numerous cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e which &s;urround them. They will neither regulate their diet, nor clean&s;e their per&s;ons and habitations; and when to the influence of their own intem|perance, and the poi&s;on generated in their hou&s;es and on their bodies, is added the debilitating operation of peculiar &s;ea&s;ons and other cau&s;es which are above human control, great numbers of them mu&s;t &s;ink and peri&s;h.</P>
<P>Nor is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that any human means can, in every ca&s;e, guard life, in a pe&s;tilential &s;tate of air. If we admit <HI>de|bility</HI> to be the univer&s;al proximate cau&s;e of the plague, we are not &s;ure that our be&s;t efforts to obviate its effects will always &s;uc|ceed. We may not be able to find or to apply, in all ca&s;es and under all circum&s;tances, the preci&s;e degree of &s;timulus, nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the corporeal functions; and the variety of con&s;titu|tions, and diver&s;e operations of the &s;ame remedies on different bodies, will defeat, in &s;ome ca&s;es, the mo&s;t exact application of the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Of one thing I am confident, that, in our cities as now con|&s;tructed, no rigors of police can &s;o effectually clean&s;e away the
<PB N="243" REF="036687_0598_100AA56D2BBFEBB0">
&s;ources of poi&s;on, as to prevent a return of pe&s;tilence, without the univer&s;al introduction of a new dome&s;tic economy, and new modes of living. I am firmly per&s;uaded that fruitful &s;ources of the evil lie in the&s;e two articles&mdash;the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;timulant food and liquors, and the neglect of per&s;onal wa&s;hing. The diet of the Americans, like that of the Engli&s;h, is of the mo&s;t nouri&s;hing kind&mdash;a large portion of the be&s;t fle&s;h meats, and high-&s;ea&s;oned fi&s;h and vegetables. Our drink is of the &s;ame character&mdash;the be&s;t high wines, &s;pirits and brandy.</P>
<P>In winter, our bodies &s;u&s;tain this &s;timulant mode of living; the extreme cold continually re&s;i&s;ting its effects by its debilitating powers. But when &s;ummer arrives, and the violent &s;timulus of heat, is added to the high &s;timulus of the be&s;t diet, two cla&s;&s;es of men fall a &s;acrifice to violent fevers. Fir&s;t, men who pu&s;h their &s;timulus beyond the powers of nature, by exce&s;&s;ive exer|tion, and imtemperance in eating and drinking&mdash;hence a robu&s;t man riots in debauch to day, and four days after is in his grave. Secondly, men who live freely in winter, and reduce their diet too low in &s;ummer, to avoid di&s;ea&s;es, inducing a weak, languid &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be obvious to any per&s;on in America, that the French mode of living, in regard to diet, drink, and the liberal u&s;e of water, protects them from the epidemic di&s;ea&s;es which prey up|on the Americans, and Briti&s;h natives. Nor have I the lea&s;t doubt, that a &s;uitable regimen, pur&s;ued rigorou&s;ly by the Euro|peans, would have &s;aved one half the people, who peri&s;hed in the black pe&s;tilence in 1348.</P>
<P>Unfortunate &s;ouls! They believed the plague to be communi|cated by infection only; they &s;ought &s;afety by flight; they em|barked on board of ve&s;&s;els, and launched out upon the ocean, to <HI>e&s;cape infection;</HI> but all in vain; the di&s;ea&s;e attacked them in ev|ery &s;ituation, and the world was almo&s;t di&s;peopled. Had they known that the di&s;temper was induced &s;olely by the debilitating qualities of the elements and the &s;ea&s;on, what multitudes would have applied the true remedy, and &s;urvived! Thanks to a kind providence, &s;uch a &s;ingularly depre&s;&s;ing &s;tate of the air, rarely occurs, but when it does, there is no flight from the &s;ources of di&s;|ea&s;e,

as in ordinary plagues, which ari&s;e in the impure atmo&s;phere of cities only; but men mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the applications which re&s;i&s;t the effects of debility, and maintain the energy of the &s;y&s;tem by &s;upplying the defective powers of the elements, with artificial &s;timuli.</P>
<P>I cannot clo&s;e this &s;ection, without a few remarks on the gen|eral plan of building large towns.</P>
<P>The ancient mode of con&s;tructing cities bears &s;ome character|i&s;tics of the age and ta&s;te of the nations, in which they were re|&s;pectively founded. Mo&s;t of the old cities were evidently built with reference to a &s;tate of war and robbery; being intended for &s;afety, rather than for convenience; as appears by their narrow &s;treets and the projections of the upper &s;tories of the hou&s;es. The more people could be crouded into a &s;mall &s;pace, the le&s;s military force was nece&s;&s;ary to defend the town.</P>
<P>However this may be, tho&s;e cities were very ill-con&s;tructed for the purpo&s;es of health. Savary a&s;&s;erts that 200 per&s;ons in Grand Cairo occupy le&s;s &s;pace than 30 in Paris. The &s;treets are &s;o narrow and full of people, that they jo&s;tle again&s;t each other, and &s;ometimes a man is obliged to wait &s;ome minutes, before he can make his way. Letter 3. Yet this &s;ame author alleges the plague to be <HI>not native</HI> in Egypt! Surely a man of &s;cience need not go out of Cairo to look for cau&s;es of pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>Many &s;treets in Con&s;tantinople are narrow and crouded like tho&s;e in Cairo.</P>
<P>The old city of London, before the <HI>fortunate</HI> conflagration of 1666, was in a like predicament; its &s;treets narrow and almo&s;t clo&s;ed above by the jutting of the upper &s;tories of the hou&s;es. In the old &s;treets, which e&s;caped the fire, notwith&s;tanding all the improvements of modern days, which have mitigated the violence of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, I am informed people are &s;till infe&s;ted with nervous and typhus fevers. London is however greatly in|debted to the conflagration. In the pre&s;ent con&s;truction of the buildings, <HI>one</HI> per&s;on, it is &s;aid, occupies as much ground as <HI>two</HI> did before the fire. The &s;ize and arrangement of hou&s;es and apartments are al&s;o improved; and better adapted to a free circu|lation of air. The introduction of fre&s;h water may al&s;o be num|bered

among the be&s;t pre&s;ervatives from di&s;ea&s;e. The&s;e are a|mong the cau&s;es of the non-appearance of the plague in modern London, and the diminution of the annual bills of mortality, within the la&s;t half century.</P>
<P>The plague however has di&s;appeared in other cities of Europe, where no &s;uch improvements have been made&mdash;a curious fact, that will be hereafter con&s;idered.</P>
<P>But the di&s;ea&s;e continues to prevail occa&s;ionally in the ea&s;tern parts of Europe, in Hungary, Poland and Ru&s;&s;ia, which were &s;everely ravaged in 1770, and 1771. The di&s;ea&s;e al&s;o raged at Oczakow, on the north border of the Euxine as late as the year 1739.</P>
<P>That part of Europe abounds with mar&s;hes and &s;tagnant wa|ter, and con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly of level land. This may account for the continuance of the plague, in that quarter.</P>
<P>The United States unfortunately contain &s;imilar &s;ources of di&s;ea&s;e, in number and extent &s;carcely equalied. Yet in&s;tead of profiting by the &s;evere di&s;tre&s;&s;es which all great cities have &s;uffer|ed once in fifteen or twenty years, from pe&s;tilence, and guarding again&s;t the artificial cau&s;es of it, our ance&s;tors began and we are continuing to build cities, on t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Gothic plan, without more re|gard to the lives and happine&s;s of our citizens, than that which was manife&s;ted by the barbarians of antiquity. The moderns how|ever proceed on the &s;ame plan from a different motive, which is, avarice. It is now the intere&s;t of the proprietors of lots in a city, to which all the plea&s;ure of living, and the health of citi|zens, are &s;acrificed.</P>
<P>We are preci&s;ely in the latitudes mo&s;t favorable to the produc|tion of pe&s;tilence. In the tropical climates, con&s;tant heat &s;oon fits the human body to &s;u&s;tain it, and the <HI>natives</HI> of tho&s;e climates are &s;eldom affected by the furious rage of epidemic pe&s;tilential di&s;|ea&s;es. Within the tropics <HI>&s;trangers</HI> alone are &s;ufferers by the climate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Savary remarks "that the plague &s;eldom reaches the polar circle and never pa&s;&s;es the tropics. The caravans of Cairo, Dama&s;cus and I&s;pahan, which are &s;ometimes infected, never propagate it at Mecea, and Yemen is &s;afe from the plague." With few exceptions the&s;e ob&s;ervations are ju&s;t. If the natives of cool regions pa&s;s &s;uddenly into tropical cli|mates, they are &s;ubject to violent fevers; but the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned in the text is &s;ufficient to account for the perpetual exemption of <HI>natives</HI> of hot climates from the wor&s;t form of pe&s;tilence. Their bodies mould them|&s;elves to the climate&mdash;their excitement or debility is always uniform. it is the great changes, in the&s;e re&s;pects, which expo&s;e people in the middle latitudes to the attacks of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="036687_0601_100AA5735207E010">But in the temperate latitudes, men are continually &s;ubject to the alternations of extreme heat and cold&mdash;changes ho&s;tile to the &s;y&s;tem.

<P>It is a mo&s;t unque&s;tionable fact that the northern &s;tates of A|merica from New-York to Maine, are in a po&s;ition on the globe, as expo&s;ed to the plague as the cities of Mar&s;eilles, Naples, Rome and Con&s;tantinople; and the &s;outhern &s;tates have a po&s;ition cor|re&s;ponding with the latitude of Syria, the Barbary coa&s;t and E|gypt; that portion of the earth which is <HI>mo&s;t frequently</HI> ravaged with pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>If then we live in a climate in which the human body, from alternate heat and cold, is mo&s;t irritable, and mo&s;t &s;ubject to ma|lignant autumnal di&s;tempers; and if a part of our country is pe|culiarly adapted to the production of &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es; the mo&s;t &s;e|rious of all que&s;tions ari&s;es; what &s;hall we do to prevent a fre|quent return of &s;uch calamities?</P>
<P>To me, the path is extremely plain. Our climate we cannot change&mdash;much of our country cannot be rai&s;ed into hills, nor drained of its &s;tagnant waters&mdash;the laws of nature we are unable to control in the operation.&mdash;But <HI>our</HI> duty is plain. Men mu&s;t not plant their habitations near mar&s;hy grounds&mdash;the mode of building cities <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be totally changed&mdash;and &s;o mu&s;t the u&s;ual hab|its of our citizens.</P>
<P>Throughout the whole Atlantic territory, on the low lands, it is more e&s;&s;ential that large towns &s;hould be purpo&s;ely con&s;truc|ted for health.&mdash;Great cities are u&s;ually founded on commerce, and commerce requires the acce&s;s of navigable water. Hence &s;uch towns are commonly near the &s;ea &s;hore or on the borders of rivers.&mdash;But if they are near low mar&s;hy grounds they cannot be

healthful. High and dry po&s;itions, with rocky or gravelly earth, are the proper places for populous cities, on account of fre&s;h air and good water.</P>
<P>But in any &s;itation, our cities are too crouded for health or comfort. Lots are too &s;mall&mdash;too many people are crouded on to a little &s;pace of ground. A family to every lot of 25 or 30 feet by 80 or 100, connot fail to generate too much filth, and to vitiate the air in too great a degree, for the health of the citi|zens. In every large town in the United States, however re|mote from mar&s;h, and however healthy its po&s;ition, the effects of crouded population are obvious, every autumn, in the &s;ickne&s;s and death of <HI>children.</HI> Multitudes and multitudes of lives are anually &s;acrificed, in all cities, to the avarice of the original proprietors of lots. The little narrow dirty hou&s;es, kitchens and yards &s;urrounded with high fences, excluding air and veget|ation; all that can di&s;&s;ipate or ab&s;orb the noxious exhalations; all that can purify the atmo&s;phere and refre&s;h the exhau&s;ted frame of a human being, panting beneath a &s;ultry &s;un&mdash;every thing in our cities is contrived to <HI>wa&s;te the powers of life, and &s;horten its duration.</HI></P>

<P>But I maintain that this is not exterminating the root of the evil. Cities <HI>may</HI> be built &s;o as to unite all the utility of a town, with the &s;alubrity and plea&s;ures of the country, and in this new world, where men are as free to act as to think, it will be di&s;|honorable not to invent and execute a plan for the&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Were I called upon for a plan of a city, which &s;hould com|bine in it the advantages of town and country, I &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t the following as the outline:</P>
<P N="1">1. The po&s;ition to be on the &s;hore of the &s;ea or the bank of a river, gently a&s;cending with an angle of at lea&s;t fifteen or twenty degrees; which would form a declivity for a rapid de&s;cent of wa|ter to wa&s;h the city; at the &s;ame time, would not prevent the draft of heavy loads from the river or ocean.</P>
<P N="2">2. The wharves on the water &s;hould be extended beyond low water mark, that no part of the docks &s;hould be left bare by the rece&s;s of the tide. All the &s;olid front of the wharves &s;hould be on a line; that no eddies might be formed; and the water might flow in a pa&s;&s;ing current. This would carry off &s;ub&s;tances thrown into the water, and contribute to keep the air pure by motion and change. Should it be nece&s;&s;ary to extend wharfing in one place further than in another, it &s;hould be in the form of a bridge on piers.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="249" REF="036687_0604_100AA579D1A797A0">3. The warehou&s;es on the wharves &s;hould not be jumbled to|gether in a chaos; one projecting in front of another; but built in a &s;trait range, at a &s;uitable di&s;tance from the water; and an alley &s;hould pa&s;s between them for the admi&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h air on every &s;ide. No wet cellars &s;hould be permitted.</P>
<P N="4">4. The &s;treets &s;hould be &s;trait, inter&s;ecting each other at right angles, and forming the city into &s;quares of at lea&s;t 500 feet on a &s;ide.</P>
<P N="5">5. The lots &s;hould be at lea&s;t 60 feet wide, and 250 feet long. No more than 35 or at mo&s;t 40 feet of the breadth of the lot to be ev|er covered with buildings, &s;o that a &s;pace of 20 or 25 feet &s;hould intervene between the hou&s;es. This &s;pace would leave a cartway, give free admi&s;&s;ion to air, and reduce the ri&s;k of fire 75 per cent.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the rear of the front building, out hou&s;es might cover 100 feet of the length of the lot. The remaining 150 feet &s;hould be laid out to the fancy of the owner in a garden&mdash;the po|lice interfering no farther than to require by law that &s;ome kind of trees or vegetables &s;hould occupy the &s;pace&mdash;vegetation being the natural purifier of the air.</P>
<P N="7">7. Directly thro the center of each &s;quare, &s;hould run a nar|row &s;treet of about 25 feet taken out of the rear of the lots, which &s;treet or alley &s;hould never be built on, but would admit a pa&s;&s;age for citizens thro the &s;quares; and what would be &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful, would admit du&s;t-carts to take up all the filth of the hou&s;es, from the rear, and prevent that intole|rable nui&s;ance, the depo&s;iting of offen&s;ive materials in the &s;treets. The little flower gardens and &s;hady lawns in the&s;e &s;quares, would pre&s;erve the air pure, fre&s;h and cool in &s;ummer&mdash;they would oc|cupy many per&s;ons of delicate health, thus contributing to their comfort, diverting their minds, and in many ca&s;es, re&s;toring them to health. Here al&s;o children would find room to gambol, without endangering their lives or annoying pa&s;&s;engers in the &s;treets; and here the young of both &s;exes would acquire a ta&s;te for gardening, for botany, and the delightful amu&s;ement of &s;tudy|ing the works of nature.</P>
<P N="8">8. The &s;treets &s;hould be one hundred feet in breadth, and

planted with three rows of trees. One row on each &s;ide next the foot walks, and a row in the center. The foot walks to be 15 feet wide. The trees next the walks would then be 15 feet from the hou&s;es; and a &s;pace between the center row and each &s;ide row, of 35 feet. The trees might be &s;o pruned, as to prevent their injuring the buildings, and their di&s;tance would prevent their interfering with fire engines. The&s;e trees would be leafle&s;s in winter, when the &s;un is acceptable; and in &s;ummer would &s;weeten, purify and cool the air. The citizens at all times in the day, would walk in a refre&s;hing &s;hade&mdash;the center row of trees would furni&s;h &s;hade for hor&s;es.</P>
<P N="9">9. No city &s;hould be rai&s;ed on level earth. If a natural po|&s;ition cannot be found, with a general declivity to the water, the &s;treets &s;hould be thrown into artificial elevations of at lea&s;t 3 feet in every hundred&mdash;five feet in the hundred would be better. This would give celerity to the water falling in &s;howers, and wonderfully a&s;&s;i&s;t in removing filthy &s;ub&s;tances from the &s;treets; for after all human efforts in &s;weeping, much offen&s;ive matter will remain, which water alone will reach and carry off.</P>
<P N="10">10. No pains &s;hould be &s;pared to &s;upply a city with fre&s;h run|ning water.</P>
<P>It is a point of infinite importance that citizens &s;hould not depend on water from pumps in the city. In a few years, the &s;ubterranean water becomes impregnated with the noxious parti|cles from vaults&mdash;and this evil continues to increa&s;e with the age of the city. One of two remedies are to be provided&mdash;either the city mu&s;t be &s;upplied with fre&s;h water by pipes from a di&s;tant &s;ource; or the vaults mu&s;t be &s;o formed as to be capable of being opened in winter and clean&s;ed. But the la&s;t method, tho u&s;e|ful and practi&s;ed in &s;ome European cities, would be ineffectual.</P>
<P>The back hou&s;es in a city are, in many re&s;pects, a terrible nui&s;ance. If a &s;ewer could be carried four or five feet under ground, and every &s;uch hou&s;e be &s;et over it, a &s;tream of water pa&s;&s;ing thro it from a di&s;tant &s;ource, would be an excellent means of clean&s;ing a city from this &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;e. But &s;uch &s;treams of water are rarely to be obtained.</P>
<P>Another expedient &s;ugge&s;ts it&s;elf for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Let a &s;ewer of three feet wide and well paved, be run in a &s;trait
<PB N="251" REF="036687_0606_100AA57EB693B1E8">
line under the rear of the lots, and all back hou&s;es &s;et over it. In &s;uitable places, let channels be made to turn the water from the &s;treets into the &s;ewers, in long or violent &s;howers, when the water is not wanted to wa&s;h the &s;treets. In this manner, the &s;ewers might be wa&s;hed perfectly clean, a number of times every &s;ummer, and the citizens pre&s;erved from their poi&s;onous exha|lations.</P>
<P>On a model of this kind, I conceive cities &s;hould be con|&s;tructed in the <HI>mo&s;t healthy</HI> &s;ituations; for a crouded population, in any place on earth, will le&s;&s;en the &s;alubrity of the air. Clo&s;e compact cities, in any quarter of the globe, are the graves of men. All the great cities of Europe require annually &s;ome thou|&s;ands of &s;trangers to &s;upply their wa&s;te of population. Yet there is no nece&s;&s;ity for men to croud together in &s;uch a compact form. There is land enough on earth to &s;uffer any exten&s;ion of cities, and it makes little difference, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, whether a lot contains one hundred feet of land or half an acre. Nor would a le&s;s den&s;e population be any inconvenience to men, in bu|&s;ine&s;s. They might be obliged to walk further on &s;ome occa|&s;ions; but in the cool &s;hade of my propo&s;ed city, this would be a plea&s;ure rather than a toil.</P>
<P>It is wrong, it is criminal, for legi&s;latures to permit &s;uch crouded population. It is a nui&s;ance, not only to cities, but to the public. It is a truth, that numbers of lives are &s;acrificed almo&s;t every year, among worthy country gentlemen, who have bu&s;ine&s;s in our large cities.</P>
<P>They come to town in the hot &s;ea&s;on, when no uncommon di&s;ea&s;e prevails among the citizens who are innured to the air&mdash; they come without &s;u&s;picion&mdash;they are &s;eized with fever and die. The air of the low grounds in our cities, even in healthy &s;ea|&s;ons, is often poi&s;on to people from the country, and gives them a fever, when no epidemic is vi&s;ible among citizens. I know the fact, and it is a &s;erious calamity, e&s;pecially to &s;eamen. The low grounds in Providence, New-York, Baltimore, &amp;c. are great nui&s;ances. The building of Water-&s;treet and Front-&s;treet in New-York, it is believed by good judges, has co&s;t this city a thou&s;and lives in five or &s;ix years. I &s;ay nothing of Philadel|phia; for its po&s;ition and the alterations in the original plan of
<PB N="252" REF="036687_0607_100AA580E301CEA8">
the city have doomed it to calamity. The citizens will not be|lieve the evil to ari&s;e among them&s;elves and therefore mu&s;t be left to their fate. If remitting fevers <HI>every</HI> year, and yellow fever <HI>often,</HI> will not convince men that &s;omething is wrong in <HI>their</HI> city, it is in vain to rea&s;on with them. Of one thing I am con|fident, that if all the earth in New-York on which Water and Front-&s;treets are built, could be &s;unk 30 feet under water with|out lo&s;s of lives, and the proprietors indemnified by the citizens, it would be the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing which heaven could in mercy be&s;tow on the city and the &s;tate. I believe al&s;o, that if all the cro&s;s &s;treets and the back hou&s;es in Philadelphia could be levelled with the earth, and the ground converted into flower gardens and gra&s;s plats, the citizens would, in twenty years, cel|ebrate the anniver&s;ary of their de&s;truction, with as much fervor as the republicans in France celebrate the demolition of the Ba&s;tile.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible, I &s;peak it with zeal and confidence; it is not po&s;&s;ible, under the operation of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> laws of nature, for men to be healthy in many of our cities, during the heat of &s;ummer. That open champaign country, which regularly pro|duces intermitting and remitting fevers, will, when planted with populous cities, often produce the plague. Of that country, there is an extent in the United States, of more than one thou|&s;and miles in length, and from 40 to 60 in breadth.</P>
<P>All the &s;hore of the Atlantic from the Hud&s;on north-ea&s;tward will admit of healthy cities. If the commercial towns on that portion of America were con&s;tructed on the foregoing plan, I would an&s;wer for it, that they would never be ravaged with yellow fever. Individual ca&s;es might occur; but the di&s;ea&s;e could not, without a miracle, become epidemic. But as our towns are now built they will at times be partially affected. In <HI>ordinary</HI> &s;ea&s;ons and with a vigilant police they will e&s;cape, with the yearly lo&s;s of only ten, fifteen or perhaps fifty citizens, the unfortunate victims of the negligence, the folly, and the crouded population of cities. In very <HI>unfavorable &s;ea&s;ons,</HI> the number of victims will be <HI>increa&s;ed. Such is the fate of our northern cities.</HI></P>
<P>But the de&s;tiny of cities on the &s;outhern Atlantic &s;hore, is to be more &s;evere.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="036687_0608_100AA58269826760">The period of general contagion may &s;ub&s;ide, and intervals of more general public health, may be expected. The mo&s;t un|healthy parts of the earth enjoy &s;uch intervals, when the rage of malignant complaints is &s;u&s;pended. But the melancholy periods of epidemics will often recur&mdash;and as the plague, in all its &s;hapes, is the offspring of <HI>cau&s;es,</HI> mankind, wherever tho&s;e cau&s;es exi&s;t, are de&s;tined to be afflicted.</P>
<P>Away then with crouded cities&mdash;the 30 feet lots and alleys&mdash; the artificial re&s;ervoirs of filth&mdash;the hot beds of atmo&s;pheric poi&s;on. Such are our cities&mdash;they are great pri&s;ons, built with immen&s;e labor to breed infection and hurry mankind prematurely to the grave.</P>
<P>There is no nece&s;&s;ity for this de&s;truction of human life. Cit|ies laid out on my plan would unite all the plea&s;ures of country villages, rural &s;eats, and commercial towns. The merchant, in his ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, would enjoy the grateful &s;hade of oaks and elms, with the luxuriant perfumes of odoriferous flowers. At the &s;ame time, this verdant city would &s;uper&s;ede the u&s;e of &s;ol|itary country-&s;eats in &s;ummer; and thus &s;ave the expen&s;e now in|curred of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a town and country hou&s;e. The country &s;eat of a merchant, is a tax of ten, fifteen or twenty thou&s;and dollars, paid to maintain the poi&s;on and pe&s;tilence of our pre&s;ent cities.</P>
<P>It is remarked by Boyle and other authors that China is rarely affected with the plague. The pe&s;tilence of 1347 is &s;aid to have commenced in that country; but it &s;eems to be agreed that China and &s;ome other A&s;iatic countries are not often affected. This fact, if ju&s;t, de&s;erves inve&s;tigation; in particular ought philo&s;o|phers to examin the nature and properties of the &s;oil and the min|eral productions.</P>
<P>China is a very populous country, filled with canals, and well cultivated. It is probable that the water in the canals is never &s;tagnant, nor filled with vegetables&mdash;it is probable that the face of the country has been completely dried by cultivation, all &s;wamps and moi&s;t grounds drained and covered with corn, rice and gra&s;s. How much the&s;e improvements have contributed to pre&s;erve its inhabitants from pe&s;tilence, I need not inform my readers.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="036687_0609_100AA584AB93D688">The cities al&s;o in China are va&s;tly large and populou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and an enquiry will ari&s;e, how tho&s;e cities e&s;cape the plague, if great population contributes &s;o much to the calamity.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, they do not e&s;cape all plagues&mdash;&s;ome of the mo&s;t vi|olent have ravaged China; but they probably e&s;cape the &s;lighter plagues, which are the mo&s;t frequent; and this is all that man|kind can expect.</P>
<P>We are not &s;ufficiently acquainted with the &s;oil, climate, police and manners of China, to &s;peak with certainty on this &s;ubject; but one fact ought to be mentioned. The Chine&s;e hou&s;es have no windows in front, on the &s;treet, but in the rear, are &s;pacious gardens filled with trees, vegetables, flowers, and fre&s;h &s;treams of water. Here the family is regaled and amu&s;ed; the air is ren|dered pure by cultivation, cleanline&s;s, and the particles exhaled from growing plants, and water-falls. This arrangement alone will account for their exemption from the u&s;ual di&s;ea&s;es of hot climates.&mdash;When the Americans, with their boa&s;ted light and &s;cience, &s;hall become as <HI>wi&s;e</HI> as the Chine&s;e, they may expect to &s;hare in the exemption.</P>
<P>It is a fact related by Ru&s;&s;el and others, that in the mid&s;t of the Turki&s;h cities, during a de&s;olating plague, the &s;pacious man|&s;ions of the wealthy Turks, which are kept clean, and well aired, often e&s;cape the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I cannot leave this deeply intere&s;ting &s;ubject, without relating an anecdote from antiquity, which &s;hows in what light wi&s;e men formerly viewed it.</P>
<P>In Greece, the countries of Attica and Lacedemon, con&s;i&s;t of dry, gravelly or rocky land; and I can find but one in&s;tance, in which tho&s;e countries were affected by pe&s;tilence, in the early ages. It is evident from Thucydides, that the plague had never been known in Athens before his time, &s;ince the date of the earlie&s;t traditions; and then it was probably induced principally by the croud of people collected in the &s;iege, to e&s;cape the rava|ges of the Lacedemonians.</P>
<P>Boeotia, on the contrary, was more frequently vi&s;ited by pe&s;ti|lence. To account for this, let us know what was the &s;ituation of this country. It is thus de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="036687_0610_100AA586E595C7C8">Boeotia may be con&s;idered as a large ba&s;on, &s;urrounded by mountains, the different chains of which are connected by high grounds. Mo&s;t of the rivers from the&s;e hills unite in Lake Co|pais, of fourteen leagues circumference, which has no apparent outlet; but, it was alleged by the ancients, to have &s;ubterrane|an pa&s;&s;ages into the &s;ea. The country is not without hills, but is mo&s;tly level, and very fruitful. The air in Attica is rema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a|bly pure; but in Boeotia, very den&s;e; hence the ancients derived the heavy, phlegmatic character of its inhabitants from the air. This country &s;eems to have been to Attica, what Holland now is to France.</P>
<BIBL>See Travels of Anachar&s;is, Ch. 34 and the authorities there cited.</BIBL>
<P>From &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of hi&s;tory, it appears that Boeotia was more frequently vi&s;ited by pe&s;tilence than Attica. This we &s;hould expect from the difference of their &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tin, lib. 16. ca. 3. informs us, that the Boeotians once con&s;ulted the Delphic Oracle, how to remedy the plague that troubled them. The Oracle replied, "That they mu&s;t plant a colony in the country of Pontus, &s;acred to Hercules." But they were &s;o much attached to their own country, that they di&s;|obeyed the injunction; until another calamity, war, drove them to con&s;ult the Oracle a &s;econd time, when, receiving a &s;imilar an&s;wer, a part of the people removed to the borders of the Eux|ine, and founded the famous city of Heraclea.</P>
<P>This Oracle certainly under&s;tood the cau&s;e of the evil, and directed to a &s;uitable remedy. The an&s;wer implies, "you mu&s;t thin your population," or "you mu&s;t &s;eek a more &s;alubrious cli|mate," or it might comprehend both the&s;e ideas. The direction is full of wi&s;dom, and is &s;trictly applicable to many of our Amer|ican cities. Tran&s;lated into the language of our circum&s;tances, it runs thus "thin your population, by &s;preading your citizens over a larger extent of ground, or you will often be driven from your cities, into the country."</P>
<P>We have Mo&s;es and the prophets, in books and experience, and if we will not li&s;ten to them, neither the Delphic Oracle, nor a me&s;&s;enger from the thou&s;ands of dead who have peri&s;hed by the plagues of our cities, would induce belief or effect a reformation.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XVIII. Of the di&s;appearance of the plague in &s;ome parts of Europe, and of new di&s;ea&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a common remark that no plague has appeared in Eng|land, &s;ince the year 1665, and that the di&s;order has cea&s;ed in the we&s;t of Europe, for near a century pa&s;t. This happy ex|emption from that horrible calamity has been a&s;cribed to various cau&s;es. Many people a&s;cribe it to health laws&mdash;a &s;ubject that has been already di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Some allege that the u&s;e of fo&s;&s;il coal has bani&s;hed the plague from London; and Hoffman re|lates that Halle in Germany, which u&s;ed to be afflicted with malignant fevers, has been free from them &s;ince coal has been u&s;ed as fuel. Others &s;uppo&s;e that the great improvements in building and in the modes of living, in modern times, have been the means of preventing the return of pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t cau&s;e, I have already given my opinion, and the rea&s;ons on which it is founded. I find no &s;ufficient evidence that health laws ever &s;aved a country or city from pe&s;tilence, in a &s;ingle in&s;tance; but abundant po&s;itive proof of their utter ineffi|cacy, in a great number of ca&s;es.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the u&s;e of coal, we ought not to indulge very &s;anguine expectations. It may be true, that violent di&s;ea&s;es be|came more rare or wholly di&s;appeared, in &s;ome places, about the time that coal became of general u&s;e as fuel. But let us ex|amin facts, and not tru&s;t to general cur&s;ory ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The digging of coal at New-Ca&s;tle for fuel commence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> early as the year 1234, as appears by a charter of Henry III. and how much earlier, is not known. It was u&s;ed in London as early as 1379, in con&s;iderable quantities; but when fir&s;t in|troduced, does not appear. In 1550, coal was in common u&s;e
<PB N="257" REF="036687_0612_100AA58B16DAE808">
in London&mdash;its price "twelve &s;hillings a load." The price in 1590 was rai&s;ed to "nine &s;hillings a chaldron," which was deemed exorbitant. Thus far we have little light on the &s;ub|ject; but in 1615, the coal trade occupied four hundred &s;hips; <HI>two hundred</HI> of which were employed between London and New-Ca&s;tle. The pre&s;ent number is <HI>five hundred,</HI> and London con|tains more than double the inhabitants it did at that time.</P>
<BIBL>See Ander&s;on's Com. vol. 1. and Fleetwood's Chron.</BIBL>
<P>In 1615 then the u&s;e of coal mu&s;t have been general in Lon|don, and for &s;ome time before, for the growth of the trade mu&s;t have been gradual. But for fifty years after this general u&s;e of coal, London was afflicted by the plague; the city indeed was rarely free from it, as appears by the bills of mortality, and three times, after that period, the city was ravaged by that di&s;|temper as an epidemic, viz. in 1625, 1636 and 1665.</P>
<P>So far we have no encouragement to hope for a prevention of the plague by the u&s;e of coal. With re&s;pect to the city of Halle, I can &s;ay nothing. The ob&s;ervation of Hoffman may be ju&s;t, and yet coal may have had no influence in checking the prevalence of pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>It belongs to phy&s;icians to a&s;certain the effect of the vapor from this fo&s;&s;il &s;ub&s;tance on human health. Certain it is, that it occa&s;ions inconveniences to tho&s;e who are not accu&s;tomed to it. So general was the prejudice again&s;t it, when fir&s;t u&s;ed in Lon|don, that in the year 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">00, the nobility and citizens petitioned the king "to prohibit the further u&s;e of &s;o noxious and un|healthy a kind of fuel." And. Com. vol. 6. Ap. 935. There is rea&s;on to believe it is not very unhealthy, but I &s;ee no ground to &s;uppo&s;e it has had the lea&s;t influence in arre&s;ting the progre&s;s, or preventing the return of the plague.</P>
<P>To confirm this opinion, I would mention that the plague di&s;appeared in France and other parts of Europe, about the time it did in England; in Paris, for in&s;tance, where no coal is u&s;ed. In a great part of Europe therefore the &s;ame effect has taken place, without the &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;e; which leaves us at liberty to reject that cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The third rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for the ce&s;&s;ation of the plague, viz.
<PB N="258" REF="036687_0613_100AA58D424B3C08">
improvements in building hou&s;es and cities, and in clothing, diet, the u&s;e of fre&s;h water and the like, is a ju&s;t one; and there can be no rational doubt that the&s;e alterations have contributed to mitigate the violence and re&s;train the progre&s;s, of many acute di&s;ea&s;es. Pe&s;tilential epidemics are probably le&s;s frequent within the la&s;t century, at lea&s;t in the more civilized and commercial parts of Europe, and al&s;o in America, than they had been in former periods.</P>
<P>The poverty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, the dirty, crouded mud cottages, and the &s;canty &s;upply of whole&s;ome food, which was the common fare of the pea&s;antry, in Europe, mu&s;t have given origin or cur|rency to many di&s;ea&s;es; and greatly aggravated their &s;everity. A &s;ample of this may be &s;een in the early appearance of mortal di&s;ea&s;es in the low narrow &s;treets and &s;mall crouded apartments now occupied by the poorer people in our cities, and the difficulty of expelling a pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e from &s;uch places.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following extracts will &s;how the &s;tate of cities and of man|ners, at the periods mentioned.</P>

<P>As a general remark it may be alleged with great probability that Europe has derived no &s;mall benefit, in regard to public health, from the following circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. From the modern improvements in agriculture, by which means many places are dried and &s;weetened, which u&s;ed to be cold, damp and fetid.</P>
<P>Agriculture not only removes, from the earth, &s;ub&s;tances po|&s;itively noxious to health; but covers its &s;urface with growing vegetables po&s;itively &s;alubrious. This is one in&s;tance of multi|tudes,
<PB N="259" REF="036687_0614_100AA5901125ADD0">
in the economy of the world, in which the happine&s;s, com|fort and intere&s;t of man are made to depend on his indu&s;try.</P>
<BIBL>See Dr. Ru&s;h's Works, vol. 1. p. 25.</BIBL>
<P>Secondly. Improvements in building hou&s;es may have con|tributed to the &s;ame &s;alutaray end. The materials are of a kind le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of accumulating and retaining infectious exhalations, than formerly&mdash;the apartments are more &s;pacious, elevated and airy.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Hou&s;es are le&s;s crouded than in ancient times, as appears by the proclamation of Queen Elizabeth, recited in the foregoing hi&s;tory. In London, one per&s;on, &s;ince the fire of 1666, is &s;uppo&s;ed to occupy as much &s;pace as two in the old city. This remark applies e&s;pecially to the poor, who were formerly more numerous than at pre&s;ent. Some of the nobles, in the old city, had &s;pacious gardens, but the ma&s;s of people were mi&s;erably poor and crouded into narrow filthy lodgings.</P>
<P>Fourthly. There is probably an immen&s;e difference in regard to general cleanline&s;s, between the people even of the &s;ixteenth century, and the pre&s;ent age. For this we are partly indebted to commerce, the &s;ource of wealth and refinement. A more gen|eral u&s;e of linen and cotton in cloathing, articles which require wa&s;hing frequently, may have contributed to the &s;ame object.</P>
<P>Fifthly. The introduction of pure water into cities from di&s;|tant &s;ources, and a liberal u&s;e of it, in hou&s;es, and the &s;treets, have aided in the &s;ame &s;alutary work of dimini&s;hing the calamities of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Sixthly. It is believed that the modern diet is more friendly to health than that of former times. It is evident that to this change Europe is much indebted for the di&s;appearance of &s;corbut|ic complaints, which formerly were epidemic in Holland and other parts, and which &s;till prevail in Iceland and Canada, where the poor live mo&s;tly on dried or &s;alted fi&s;h, poor fle&s;h meats, with a &s;mall portion of vegetables. The cultivation of the vine and the orchard has doubtle&s;s had a con&s;iderable effect. Cider and wine have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in pre&s;erving the body from debility in certain pe&s;tilential periods; and when temperately u&s;ed, are of excel|lent u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="036687_0615_100AA592399B8730">But I apprehend that the moderns have a&s;cribed too much to the&s;e cau&s;es. Any man who will read hi&s;tory with care, will ob|&s;erve that there has been, within about a century, a con&s;iderable abatement of pe&s;tilence in all parts of the world. The plague is far le&s;s de&s;tructive in the Levant, and Egypt, within 150 years, than it was in former ages. This mitigation has been cotemporary in all parts of the earth, of which we have any correct knowl|edge. The cau&s;e of this change, I pretend not to a&s;&s;ign; but a &s;imilar abatement has been ob&s;erved in the violence of earthquakes.</P>
<P>While I admit however that the true plague has di&s;appeared as an epidemic in many parts of Europe, I do not admit that <HI>pe&s;ti|lence,</HI> in the general &s;en&s;e of the word, has wholly di&s;appeared. If the true plague, technically &s;o called, &s;hould never again occur in London or Paris, I &s;hould then &s;ay, that improvements in mod|ern times may have <HI>mitigated the pe&s;tilence,</HI> but not that they have wholly bani&s;hed it. Under this word pe&s;tilence, I include &s;mall-pox, anginas and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">techial fever, with other malignant di&s;orders, which evidently depend on the &s;ame general cau&s;e as the real plague, operating with le&s;s force. The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es &s;till appear in all parts of Europe, and exhibit the <HI>exi&s;tence of the pe&s;ti|lential principle,</HI> altho improvements may have <HI>le&s;&s;ened</HI> and <HI>circum|&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ibed</HI> its effects.</P>
<P>I do not however con&s;ider it as certain that the true plague will not revi&s;it all the we&s;tern parts of Europe. A concurrence of cau&s;es, like that in 1348, might again produce that di&s;ea&s;e in France, England and Ireland, with all its horrors. But the probability is, that the modern improvements have removed &s;o many of the <HI>local cau&s;es</HI> of di&s;ea&s;e, that no con&s;titution of air will ever again produce the &s;ame mortality, as that under Vorti|gern or that under Edward III; nor will the plague ever again be &s;o frequent, as in former ages.</P>
<P>On this point however there is not &s;ufficient ground to build any certain calculations, for the following rea&s;ons. Every phy|&s;ician and hi&s;torian well knows that there have been frequent rev|olutions or changes in the form of certain di&s;ea&s;es&mdash;ordinary di&s;|ea&s;es with new &s;ymptoms, and di&s;ea&s;es before unknown, have appeared in various countries and in all periods.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="036687_0616_100AA593C50DBB50">The mo&s;t remarkable of the&s;e are the &s;mall-pox, venereal di&s;|ea&s;e, &s;weating &s;ickne&s;s, Hungarian fever, petechial fever and an|gina maligna, with &s;ome of le&s;s note.</P>
<P>I am not about to enter on the great que&s;tion, when or how particular di&s;ea&s;es have been introduced or modified in their &s;ymp|toms. I &s;u&s;pect however there is a fallacy in the common theory about <HI>new</HI> di&s;ea&s;es. What are u&s;ually called <HI>new</HI> are more prob|ably nothing more than the changes that are made in former di&s;|ea&s;es, by alterations in the atmo&s;phere, climate, habits of living and a multitude of inferior cau&s;es. The &s;mall-pox and the venereal di&s;ea&s;e &s;eem to have the be&s;t claim to the appellation of <HI>new;</HI> yet the fact of their being unknown before the periods a&s;|&s;igned for their appearance, has been ju&s;tly called in que&s;tion. See <HI>note</HI> at the end of this Section.</P>
<P>Certain di&s;ea&s;es however appear in particular countries, where they had not before been known, &s;ince the date of the earlie&s;t hi&s;tories. Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome have been propagated by infection; others have evidently ari&s;en from &s;ome general cau&s;e. Thus Pliny relates that the eliphantia&s;is was brought from Egypt into Italy, by Pompey's troops, but &s;oon di&s;appeared. It is &s;aid al&s;o that the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e was propagated in the we&s;t of Europe by the Cru&s;aders. Epidemic &s;curvy appeared in the maritime parts of Holland in 1556. The petechial fever which de&s;olated Spain in 1557, and afterwards all Europe, was called a <HI>new</HI> di&s;ea&s;e, different from the u&s;ual purple fever, and &s;aid to be &s;pread from the i&s;lands of the Levant through Italy to the we&s;t of Europe. The angina maligna, in Spain in 1610, was called there a <HI>new</HI> di&s;ea&s;e; and in England, where it appeared about fifty years ago, it has been called a new di&s;ea&s;e in that country.</P>
<P>But the real &s;tate of the que&s;tion &s;eems to be, that epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, mo&s;t or all of which proceed from qualities of the at|mo&s;phere, &s;uffer general changes, in conformity with the revo|lutions and alterations which take place in the phy&s;ical world. A remarkable in&s;tance of this, was the &s;udor anglicus, which was, in its general &s;ymptoms, the plague; but &s;ome general cau&s;e in England fir&s;t and afterwards on the continent, &s;uperadded a peculiar &s;ymptom, that of profu&s;e di&s;charges by the pores. This character of the di&s;ea&s;e, as has been well ob&s;erved by the
<PB N="262" REF="036687_0617_100AA596242B75E0">
author of Trait&eacute; de la pe&s;te, was the effect of a &s;pecies of revo|lution in the form of pe&s;tilence. Infection or contagion can have had no concern in producing this phenomenon. The di&s;|ea&s;e maintained this peculiar character from 1483 to 1551, a period of almo&s;t 70 years, raging occa&s;ionally in mo&s;t parts of Europe and then di&s;appeared; at lea&s;t it has never made con&s;id|erable ravages &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>This, in medical language, was a <HI>new</HI> di&s;ea&s;e, as demanding new modes of treatment; but in the language of philo&s;ophy, it was only a varied form of the &s;ame malady, and proceeding from a common cau&s;e, with the inguinal plague, but that cau&s;e in par|ticular times and places, was modified in its operation. What confirms this idea is, that this &s;weating di&s;ea&s;e never appeared as an i&s;olated epidemic, but was always cotemporary with the com|mon plague in other countries&mdash;that is, it formed a part of the general effects of the pe&s;tilential principle. Thus in 1483, about the time of its fir&s;t occurrence in England, all Europe was de&s;o|lated by the common plague. Denmark lo&s;t half its inhabitants, and many other countries fared very little better. The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of its &s;ub&s;equent returns, and of its prevalence in Ireland, Holland, France and Germany.</P>
<P>This is what I call a revolution in pe&s;tilence, and it will ap|ply to many other changes in the predominant di&s;ea&s;es of the human race.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It a&s;toni&s;hes me to read in modern books the po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions, "that the plague is never generated in Great-Britain, or other north|ern latitudes." See Mead, James' Medical Dictionary, Cullen, Ency|clopedia and other original works and compilations without number. Lord Verulam, Sir Thomas Moore, Boyle, Era&s;mus, Diemerbroeck and other luminaries of former centuries, who &s;aw the plague frequently in all its varieties, never pretended that the di&s;ea&s;e was not produced in their re&s;pective countries. The &s;udor anglicus, not only appeared <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in England, but for the fir&s;t time of its prevalence was confined to Engli&s;hmen. Yet this was the mo&s;t violent and de&s;tructive form of the plague that ever has been known.</P>

<P>Thus the petechial fever, which ravaged Europe in the &s;ix|teenth century was called a <HI>new</HI> di&s;ea&s;e; but I conceive it to
<PB N="263" REF="036687_0618_100AA598DADBDAC0">
have been no more than a varied form of the common purple fever, induced by &s;ome general variation in the elemental cau&s;e of epidemics, or by the &s;ea&s;ons. It formed a part of the pe&s;ti|lential &s;eries, and was the precur&s;or of the plague, as it is to this day, altho it has rarely been &s;o general or fatal as about the year 1556 and from 1570 to 1576.</P>
<P>It is remarkable al&s;o that the general cau&s;e extended over the Atlantic, and gave the &s;ame character to the fevers of the We&s;t-Indies. The di&s;ea&s;e which reduced the forces of Sir Francis Drake at Carthagena, in 1586, was called <HI>calenture;</HI> a &s;pecies of malignant &s;potted fever.</P>
<BIBL>Purchas, vol. 4. 1182.</BIBL>
<P>A &s;imilar fever infected the people under Sir Thomas Gates, bound to Virginia, in the beginning of the la&s;t century. And if Ulloa is correct in &s;tating that the infectious yellow fever never appeared at Carthagena, till about the year 1730, we have a remarkable proof of a revolution in the di&s;ea&s;es of that climate. We are to conclude from the facts, that the calenture was a di&s;tinct form of the pe&s;tilence incident to the country, till the beginning of the pre&s;ent century; &s;ince which, it has a&s;&s;umed the character of our bilious plague. I am however inclined to que&s;tion the fact. The true yellow fever has been known in the Engli&s;h i&s;lands from their fir&s;t &s;ettlement. It reduced Crom|well's forces when they took Jamaica in 1655.</P>
<P>It is further to be ob&s;erved that the true form of plague is never known in Spani&s;h America. But at Quito, and other places, malignant di&s;tempers under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me of <HI>&s;potted</HI> fevers, and pleuri&s;ies, &s;weep away prodigious numbers of people and fall but little &s;hort of the inguinal plague.</P>
<BIBL>Ulloa, vol. 1. 279&mdash;281.</BIBL>
<P>Such then is the pe&s;tilence of South-America; but in other periods, it may take a different form.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations al&s;o lead to an explanation of the phenom|ena of the angina maligna. It was called a <HI>new</HI> di&s;ea&s;e in Spain and England, when it fir&s;t appeared in 1610; but this is a mi&s;|take. It is evidently de&s;cribed as epidemic a century or two before tho&s;e periods. But the truth is, <HI>that form</HI> of pe&s;tilence had di&s;appeared for a long period and given way to &s;ome other
<PB N="264" REF="036687_0619_100AA59B10B09D10">
di&s;ea&s;e. After a time, it re-appeared, perhaps with &s;ome new &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>The &s;ame remarks apply to the Hungarian fever, the peculiar &s;ymptoms of which fir&s;t occurred in the &s;ixteenth century; and to a multitude of local and temporary epidemics, which have been called, on account of &s;ome &s;ingular &s;ymptoms, <HI>new</HI> di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts &s;erve to explain my idea of the di&s;appearance of the plague in certain parts of Europe. I con&s;ider the angina maligna as pe&s;tilence of the wor&s;t kind; and its occurrence in modern times, &s;ince the glandular plague is le&s;s frequent, may be only one of the revolutions in di&s;ea&s;es of a malignant type, which have marked other periods. The de&s;tructive force of the pe&s;tilential principle, falls principally upon the throat, in&s;tead of the brain or the glands, and mo&s;tly upon youth. This may be the principal form of pe&s;tilence for a century or two, when it may di&s;appear and give way to the common plague, or to &s;ome new combination of &s;ymptoms, which &s;hall p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s for a <HI>new</HI> di&s;|ea&s;e. A conjecture of this kind is authorized by &s;everal changes in the general characters of di&s;ea&s;es, at particular periods of the world. I do not therefore con&s;ider it to be <HI>certain,</HI> that the parts of Europe, which have e&s;caped the plague for a century, are &s;ecure of permanent exemption from that calamity.</P>
<P>This conjecture &s;eems to be authorized by the evident mitiga|tion of the plague in the Levant, within a century. Plagues, it has been before ob&s;erved, are obviou&s;ly le&s;s frequent and le&s;s &s;evere, in Egypt and Turkey, than they were in former ages. This remark I believe to be new, but it is a fact; and this miti|gation corre&s;ponds in time with the di&s;appearance of the di&s;ea&s;e in the healthy parts of Europe. From this circum&s;tance, I conclude that this change is the effect of &s;ome general cau&s;e, in the &s;tate of the elements.</P>
<P>This opinion may derive great &s;trength, from revolutions or changes in the natural world, analagous to that in the character of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>It is generally &s;uppo&s;ed by philo&s;ophers, that earthquakes are le&s;s frequent and violent, in modern days, that in the fir&s;t cen|turies after the Chri&s;tian era, and the imperfect &s;urvey I have
<PB N="265" REF="036687_0620_100AA59CDA8ABD20">
taken of their hi&s;tory, gives me rea&s;on to believe the opinion well founded.</P>
<P>The eruption of volcanoes is very often &s;u&s;pended for a long period. Etna was quiet about forty-five years, at the beginning of the pre&s;ent century. The volcanic mountain in Teneriffe, which had been quiet ever &s;ince the year 1704, again di&s;charg|ed its fires in Augu&s;t la&s;t&mdash;after a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ninety-four years. There are other volcanic mountains that have &s;lumbered for ma|ny centuries, as Lipari, near Sicily.</P>
<P>The aurora borealis has its revolutions. Sometimes it di&s;ap|pears for half a century or more; then returns, and frequently illuminates the heavens.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;ons, on a &s;maller &s;cale, manife&s;t analagous revolu|tions. At certain periods, we have mild winters; very little fro&s;t and &s;now, with &s;outherly winds, for a &s;eries of years. Then we have a number of long, &s;everely cold winters in &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, with violent tempe&s;ts, deep &s;now, and perpetual north we&s;|terly winds. No le&s;s various are our &s;ummers, as to heat and moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>The vegetable kingdom exhibits &s;imilar changes, for which no vi&s;ible cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned. When our ance&s;tors fir&s;t &s;ettled Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, they rai&s;ed wheat on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, in the countries of Plymouth, Middle&s;ex and E&s;&s;ex; but in the year 1664 mildew appeared for the fir&s;t time to injure that u&s;eful arti|cle, and &s;ince that time, it has not been po&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e wheat, within a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;ea &s;hore.</P>
<P>It is related by the French that wheat had not been known to mildew in France, until the year 1550.</P>

<P>In 1770, the potatoe plant, in a particular part of Scotland, was attacked by a di&s;ea&s;e which was <HI>new;</HI> and it has &s;ince been &s;preading. A &s;imilar fact is related of the oats in &s;ome parts of the &s;ame country, in 1775. The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, for they are really &s;uch among vegetables, are <HI>new,</HI> and as far as they extend, they are a &s;erious calamity. They are the pe&s;tilences incident to veg|etable life; which, like di&s;ea&s;es among men, &s;pring up and di&s;|appear, without any certain cau&s;es which are within our compre|hen&s;ion.

It is cu&s;tomary to a&s;cribe &s;uch phenomena to the <HI>&s;ea|&s;ons;</HI> but it would be difficult to find any <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> or <HI>comprehen&s;ible</HI> qualities in the particular &s;ea&s;ons, producing &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es among vegetables, which had not characterized innumerable &s;ea&s;ons in former years, which produced <HI>no</HI> &s;uch effects.</P>

<P>Sometimes a new &s;pecies of tree will &s;pring up &s;pontaneou&s;ly and gradually &s;pread, where none ever grew before. The pine has thus introduced it&s;elf into Duxborough in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, within the pre&s;ent century. Not twenty years ago, a man was living there who remembered the fir&s;t white pine that ever grew in that town: but now one eighth part of the woodland is cov|ered with it.</P>

<P>The animal world di&s;plays &s;imilar changes and revolutions. We ob&s;erve, not only uncommon numbers of common in&s;ects or &s;mall animals, in particular years, for which we can a&s;&s;ign no &s;pecific cau&s;e; but we actually &s;ee certain new &s;pecies of in&s;ects, and at times, known in&s;ects grow to an uncommon &s;ize. In&s;tan|ces of the latter phenomenon have occurred in the locu&s;ts, in the frog-kind, and in flies. The flies about Plymouth in 1633, and about New-London, the la&s;t &s;ummer, are de&s;cribed, as being not only di&s;tingui&s;hable for their numbers, but for their &s;ize. Ancient authors have remarked the &s;ame phenomenon.</P>
<P>The millions of worms which &s;pread over many hundred miles of territory in America in 1770, can no more be accounted for, than the &s;udor Anglicus, or any other new form of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The in&s;ect, which about twenty years ago, fir&s;t appeared among the wheat, on Staten-I&s;land, and which has continued to multi|ply, and e&s;&s;entially injure the crops, over a great extent of coun|try, is unque&s;tionably a non-de&s;cript as to America; a new form of animal life. Men are ever fond of propagating conjectures and vulgar tales for truth. The idle &s;tory which imported this in&s;ect from Germany, and gave it the name of He&s;&s;ian fly, has been proved, by careful enquiries, to be mere conjecture; no &s;uch animal being known in Germany. Yet it has laid the foun|dation of a durable error in natural hi&s;tory. So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd are man|kind
<PB N="267" REF="036687_0622_100AA59F2DF10450">
of this vulgar prejudice, of imputing all their evils to others, that even in&s;ects mu&s;t, like plague, be imported!</P>
<P>This in&s;ect is doubtle&s;s a new &s;pecies of animal; it is one of tho&s;e varieties which nature is continually exhibiting, in the im|men&s;ity of her operations; it is a di&s;temper incident to that par|ticular plant, and others perhaps in a le&s;s degree, which, like the &s;udor anglicus may endure for half a century, and then di&s;appear; or it may be derived, from permanent cau&s;es, and de&s;tined, for a longer time, to annoy that &s;pecies of vegetable life, like the mildew on the &s;ame plant, on the maritime borders of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire. The mammoth of Siberia and A|merica, who&s;e enormous bones are &s;een in our mu&s;eums, and who&s;e race is &s;uppo&s;ed to be extinct, may be another in&s;tance of perpetual revolution in the works of nature.</P>
<P>The lofty pine, the glory of the fore&s;t, covers immen&s;e tracts of our native wilderne&s;s; but when cut down, is not propagated from the roots or &s;tump, like mo&s;t other trees. Yet I am told that in Carolina, whenever the lands are cleared of the native woods the young growth con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly of pines, tho far from any of that &s;pecies of tree. Similar changes in the &s;pecies of trees, are ob&s;erved on the clearing of lands in other parts of America.</P>
<P>So al&s;o, on clearing our lands, in every part of America, the &s;oil is &s;oon covered with a full crop of white clover, of &s;ponta|neous origin.</P>
<P>The&s;e productions are u&s;ually a&s;cribed to the &s;eeds of the plant, &s;cattered by birds, which lie inert, while covered with &s;hade and leaves, and germinate on the acce&s;s of the &s;olar rays. This &s;olution is conjectural; it is, like the importation of the fomes of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, founded on mere &s;uppo&s;ition; it is the re|&s;ort of carele&s;s, &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers, who will not take the pains to extend their views over the works of nature. Do birds con|vey the <HI>&s;eeds of pine</HI> and of <HI>clover</HI> and &s;pread them over hundreds of miles of the wilderne&s;s? Have the&s;e &s;eeds been all &s;cattered within a few years? Or will the &s;eeds endure the fro&s;t, the rain and the heat of ages, without peri&s;hing or germinating? Be&s;ides, birds feed on the &s;eeds of other gra&s;&s;es and plants, as well as
<PB N="268" REF="036687_0623_100AA5A201FD4700">
tho&s;e of white clover. Why are the&s;e not &s;pead over our woods in the &s;ame manner?</P>
<P>The phenomena of the fore&s;ts in America preclude the prob|ability, or rather the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch events. The new plants that &s;pring up, are generated by new powers in the elements, oc|ca&s;ioned by different combinations of heat, moi&s;ture and air, in|troduced by the labors of man; combinations which could not exi&s;t while the ground was clothed with trees of other &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Plants are furni&s;hed with &s;eeds for the purpo&s;e of propagation. This wi&s;e provi&s;ion of a beneficent providence, is highly u&s;eful to man, and to animals which &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the &s;eeds. But &s;eeds are not nece&s;&s;ary to the production of plants, in all climates. Every vegetable has &s;ome &s;pot on the globe, where it is indigen|ous, where it was originally produced without &s;eed; and where it will be&s;t thrive, and grow to the highe&s;t &s;tate of perfection. Such was the origin of mo&s;t of the plants now known to man. The principles of animal and vegetable life were cotemporary with the formation of the earth. New &s;pecies are generated on|ly by tho&s;e gradual alterations vi&s;ible in the operations of nature, or by accidental changes, induced by extrin&s;ic and artificial cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Animals are al&s;o produced very often without any parent, but the elements. Hear what is recorded by that accurate ob&s;erver, Dr. Lind, on the di&s;ea&s;es of hot climates, p. 208. "It is a phenomenon inconte&s;tibly true, that in &s;tagnating pools of water at Bombay, produced &s;olely by the rains, and which have no communication with any river or the &s;ea, living fi&s;h are generat|ed; many per&s;ons have eaten of them. Upon the drying up of the pools, they die and frequently are very offen&s;ive."</P>
<P>I have not the lea&s;t doubt of this fact; and it is on this prin|ciple only that we can account for the exi&s;tence of fi&s;h of various kinds, eels, &amp;c. in brooks and ponds, on the tops of hills, above impa&s;&s;ible falls; and in lakes which have no outlet. And we prove the generation of &s;uch animals in the places where they exi&s;t, not only by the impracticability of their finding a pa&s;&s;age to &s;uch &s;ituations; but by the fact, that many &s;pecies of them are never found in &s;alt water, and probably could not exi&s;t in it.
<PB N="269" REF="036687_0624_100AA5A40B000270">
Any per&s;on may be convinced of the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of fi&s;h's making their way to the heads of many &s;mall &s;treams, where they are found, by examining innumerable &s;uch &s;treams on our moun|tains, which are full of trout and other &s;mall fi&s;h, above perpen|dicular falls among &s;olid rocks, of 50 or 100 feet in height.</P>
<P>The truth is, the elements of air and water are fitted to pro|duce animals of the kinds proper to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in them; and &s;o are plants. Not a vegetable in the field is found without its worm, its fly or other in&s;ect, which it generates or feeds; and the ani|mal when peculiar to a plant, has the color and the properties of that plant. Not a &s;pecies of vegetable or animal matter, ex|po&s;ed to a &s;uitable degree of heat and moi&s;ture, which does not produce its in&s;ect. Even living animals are not an exception. Are not the large worms, formed in the human &s;tomach, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of animal life? And are they produced by a germ depo&s;it|ed by an animal of the &s;ame kind? Not at all; the &s;uppo&s;ition is ridiculous. They are a di&s;ea&s;e, cau&s;ed by the operation of heat and moi&s;ture, on &s;ub&s;tances in debilitated &s;tomachs, which fail to perform the u&s;ual dige&s;tive functions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the common theory; &s;ome per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;e them not a di&s;|ea&s;e, but a part of the animal economy, nece&s;&s;ary to full health. This however makes no difference, as to the manner of their production.</NOTE> All animals and plants have their di&s;ea&s;es; and the mildew on wheat, and the &s;car on vines, are probably the effect of the defective energies of the elements, and a con&s;equent defective proce&s;s in the vegeta|ble functions; or of infects which are the produce of the irregu|lar operations of the elements.</P>
<P>In the year 1788 a hor&s;e was publicly exhibited in Philadel|phia, with a living animal, of the worm &s;pecies, in his eye. See Mu&s;eum, vol. 3. 500. A worm of three inches in circumfer|ence and 20 inches in length was found in the liver of Mrs. Holt of Philadelphia. Ibm. When the&s;e facts are known and acknowledged, will men &s;till be found to deny the doctrin of e|quivocal generation? Worms are often generated in the &s;mall ul|cers on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;urface of the body produced by pe&s;tilence. Such is the power of excitement.</P>
<P>All creation is full of the&s;e varieties. Even the &s;tellary re|gions exhibit new &s;tars, either &s;tationary or revolving, which are

vi&s;ible for a longer or &s;horter time, and then recede from human view. Other luminous appearances, re&s;embling a lamp, a &s;pear, a beam, are often ob&s;erved, for which we can a&s;&s;ign no cau&s;e. The new &s;tars may be revolving bodies, which appear to us only in a particular part of their orbits; but other &s;ingular cele&s;tial appearances are doubtle&s;s mere variations in the forms of the ele|ment of fire.</P>
<P>The fi&s;h in the ocean are &s;ubject to the &s;ame revolutionary laws. They often abandon the banks where they have appeared for centuries, and appear in places where they were never before known. They are &s;ubject to epidemic maladies, as much as men or cattle; they often &s;icken and die, and &s;ometimes it ap|pears that the whole &s;pecies, frequenting a particular bank, is &s;uddenly extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The changes in the di&s;ea&s;es of men; all the phenomena of ep|idemics, in their origin and di&s;appearance, their increa&s;ed vio|lence and novelty of &s;ymptoms, are the effects of &s;imilar altera|tions in the elements which compo&s;e the &s;y&s;tem. We are but one &s;pecies of animals, who&s;e bodies are compo&s;ed of the &s;ame materials, and &s;ubject to the &s;ame laws, as the bodies of all other animals. Animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances are al&s;o compo&s;ed of the &s;ame elements, variou&s;ly combined; they are &s;imply varie|ties in the forms of matter endowed with life. And the intel|lectual endowments of man, with all his boa&s;ted pre-eminence, cannot exempt him from the operation of the general laws which govern every other form or combination of the elements.</P>

<P>The people in the north of Europe maintain mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly that the plague never originates in their countries. Mead even affirms that the mea&s;les, as well as &s;mall-pox, had its origin in Egypt.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Egypt declare that the plague does not originate in <HI>their</HI> country, but is always imported from the north, as Con&s;tantinople, Sm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">na, Greece or Syria; or from the Bar|bary coa&s;t; and this &s;illy notion is actually believed and circulat|ed by mo&s;t reputable travellers.

<P>In Smyrna, Syria, Cyprus, and all parts of Europe, the plague is a&s;cribed to foreign countries.

<P>Ju&s;t &s;o in America; it is not admitted by a great portion of people, that the climate can generate a pe&s;tilence.

<P>The &s;mall-pox does not u&s;ually &s;pread without infection; but I can prove, by many in&s;tances, that it does originate, in &s;po|radic ca&s;es, without infection. In South-America, it &s;preads and becomes epidemic, in certain periods, then totally di&s;appears.</P>

<P>With re&s;pect to the origin of the lues venerea, we are left in the dark, as we are with re&s;pect to the &s;mall-pox.

But there is not a &s;hadow of doubt that a &s;pecies of this di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;ted in England as early as the Norman conque&s;t; and probably in the other countries of Europe. Not a medical work of that period, if any was writ|ten in the we&s;t of Europe, has &s;urvived the ravages of time; and we are indebted to the legal e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;tews in South|wark, for the evidence of the exi&s;tence of that di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is however not at all improbable that about the year 1496, this di&s;ea&s;e might have acquired &s;ome new and malignant &s;ymp|toms, and &s;pread with a fatal rapidity, that might alarm man|kind and render the di&s;temper more an object of notice. An|tecedent to that period, it might have been much more mild and le&s;s de&s;tructive. This idea is greatly &s;trengthened by the known fact that other di&s;ea&s;es had, about the &s;ame time undergone &s;imi|lar changes. It was but about ten years before, that the plague took the <HI>&s;weating</HI> form&mdash;an event as novel, as the generation of a new di&s;ea&s;e. What is more remarkable; in the very year a&s;&s;igned for the appearance of the lues venerea, an epidemic lep|ro&s;y overran Germany; an event equally novel. The&s;e facts confirm my ideas of certain revolutions in the &s;ymptoms of di&s;|ea&s;es, corre&s;ponding with material changes in climate or modes of life.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION, Addre&s;&s;ed to the learned Societies, in America, Europe and A&s;ia.</HEAD>
<P>THE preceding hi&s;tory of Epidemic di&s;ea&s;es was undertaken &s;olely from a de&s;ire of inve&s;tigating the truth, re&s;pecting the ori|gin and phenomena of the&s;e terrible &s;courges of the human race. When the pe&s;tilence appeared in the United States in 1791 and 93, I had not a &s;u&s;picion that the popular doctrins re&s;pecting con|tagion, are not well founded. The frequent recurrence of the di&s;ea&s;e in &s;ub&s;equent years, in oppo&s;ition to all the be&s;t efforts of health officers, in executing rigid laws of quarantine, had, in 1795, &s;haken my confidence in tho&s;e doctrins. My inve&s;tigations in that and the next year, convinced me that the pe&s;tilential fever which has vi&s;ited &s;o many parts of America, is generated in the country; but &s;till I had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of a connection be|tween epidemic di&s;ea&s;es. The inve&s;tigations of the year pa&s;t, have re&s;ulted in unfolding p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nciples and facts to me altogether <HI>new</HI> and <HI>&s;urpri&s;ing;</HI> they cannot therefore be a&s;cribed to a wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h a preconceived theory.</P>
<P>The&s;e re&s;ults not only confirm my &s;u&s;picions that the pe&s;tilence of America is of dome&s;tic origin, but they overthrow the pre|conceived &s;y&s;tem of the origin of pe&s;tilence, in temperate lati|tudes, from fomes conveyed to tho&s;e climates from &s;outhern re|gions; and demon&s;trate that it originates occa&s;ionally in all lat|itudes from the 25th to the 65th.</P>
<P>It is demon&s;trated that pe&s;tilence, in temperate latitudes, is never an i&s;olated epidemic, but the cri&s;is of a &s;eries of epidemics; and we are furni&s;hed with the means of determining unequivo|cally the character of pe&s;tilence in every ca&s;e, on the following &s;imple principles.</P>
<P>"If, on the appearance of pe&s;tilence in a particular place, all
<PB N="276" REF="036687_0631_100AA5B3ABE13B08">
other di&s;ea&s;es cea&s;e, or take &s;ome of its predominant &s;ymptoms, that pe&s;tilence is generated in that place, and dependent on the &s;tate of the elements."</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, on phy&s;ical laws, that this criterion &s;hould ever fail.</P>
<P>Another criterion, almo&s;t infallible, is the prevalence of cer|tain di&s;ea&s;es before and after the pe&s;tilence. If pe&s;tilence is im|mediately preceded by mea&s;les, affections of the throat, inflam|matory or typhus fevers with anomalous &s;ymptoms, and e&s;pecially by catarrh, that pe&s;tilence is an epidemic, produced on the &s;pot, and only the <HI>autumnal form of di&s;ea&s;e</HI>&mdash;the other di&s;ea&s;es, prece|ding and following, being the vernal and hybernal forms, produ|ced by the &s;ame general principle.</P>
<P>Of the pe&s;tilences which afflict mankind, in all climates, an immen&s;e proportion, probably nineteen twentieths, belong to this &s;pecies&mdash;they are epidemics, beginning and ending at the com|mand of the elements, under the co-operating influence of &s;ea|&s;ons and local cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e epidemic pe&s;tilences are more or le&s;s infectious, accord|ing to their violence, or the places where they exi&s;t. In clo&s;e rooms and narrow alleys they are dangerous; hence their mor|tality in fleets, camps, jails, and particular parts of cities. But the infection of &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es extends to the di&s;tance of a few feet only, and is capable of di&s;&s;ipation in a free air, &s;o as to reduce the danger of attending the &s;ick almo&s;t to nothing. The &s;ame is true of di&s;ea&s;es of mere infection, not epidemic.</P>
<P>Di&s;ea&s;es, dependent on infection only, are &s;ometimes introdu|ced into cities and ho&s;pitals, and occa&s;ion con&s;iderable mortality. But they are propagated by contact or near approach only, and do not affect the character of other di&s;ea&s;es current in the place.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence re&s;ulting from the&s;e principles is, that <HI>epi|demic</HI> pe&s;tilence is not under human control&mdash;but di&s;ea&s;es propa|gated by mere infection may be arre&s;ted and &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>The only means of avoiding or mitigating epidemic pe&s;tilence are fir&s;t to withdraw the aid of local cau&s;es; &s;econdly to fit the body, by modes of living, to re&s;i&s;t its cau&s;es&mdash;and thirdly, on failure of the&s;e, to remove from the place where its exi&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="036687_0632_100AA5B5E75AF768">The infection of all di&s;ea&s;es, even tho&s;e of &s;pecific contagion, as &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les, may be avoided by keeping at a di&s;|tance from the di&s;ea&s;ed. The infection of di&s;ea&s;es not &s;pecifi|cally contagious, as plague, yellow-fever, dy&s;entery and jail fe|ver, may be nearly de&s;troyed by free air, and cleanline&s;s.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the primary cau&s;es of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, we are in the dark; but we are certain, from all hi&s;tory and modern ob&s;ervations, that the cau&s;es of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es among the hu|man race, affect every &s;pecies of animal and vegetable life.</P>
<P>The opinions which I have &s;ugge&s;ted concerning the general cau&s;e, &s;eem to have a foundation in the coincidence of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es with numerous electrical phenomena. At the &s;ame time, the reader will con&s;ider the&s;e opinions rather as <HI>conjectural,</HI> than <HI>po&s;itive.</HI> No certain conclu&s;ions can be drawn from an in|terrupted and imperfect &s;eries of facts. More materials are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to enable us to erect a theory of epidemics which &s;hall de|&s;erve full confidence.</P>
<P>The common doctrin of contagion is utterly in&s;ufficient and unphilo&s;ophical; for if admitted, it never leads us nearer to the cau&s;e. If we trace the yellow fever to the We&s;t-Indies, and the plague to Egypt or Con&s;tantinople, we are not an inch nearer to the &s;ource; for the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are not always to be found in tho&s;e countries; and the people there are as much puz|zled to find the &s;ource of them, as the people of Great Britain or America.</P>
<P>If we trace the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es to the coa&s;t of Africa, or to Siam, we are as di&s;tant as ever from the &s;ource; for many times, the di&s;ea&s;es are not to be found in tho&s;e countries, and &s;eldom in|deed are they ever found within the tropics, except among for|eigners.</P>
<P>Indeed nothing is more common than for the yellow fever to be <HI>imported into the We&s;t-Indies in ve&s;&s;els from the United States.</HI> When ve&s;&s;els from northern latitudes have long pa&s;&s;ages, it of|ten happens that &s;eamen are &s;eized with the di&s;ea&s;e, before they arrive at the i&s;lands; and the We&s;t-Indians may often allege the di&s;ea&s;e to be <HI>imported in &s;uch ve&s;&s;els, when it does not exi&s;t in the United States.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="036687_0633_100AA5B76EF7E148">In &s;hort, the doctrin of deriving all pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es from contagion or infection, were it not for the immen&s;e mi&s;chief it does to &s;ociety, would not de&s;erve a &s;erious refutation. Infec|tion is a <HI>&s;ubordinate cau&s;e</HI> of the propagating of malignant di&s;tem|pers; but is it&s;elf an <HI>effect</HI> of &s;ome more general cau&s;e, who&s;e force is a hundred fold more powerful and formidable than that of infection. I have, in conde&s;cen&s;ion to popular opinion, &s;tated the evidence of the dome&s;tic origin of the bilious plague, as it &s;tands on the arrival or non-arrival of ve&s;&s;els, and other facts of that kind. But I really con&s;ider all this evidence as trifling, when compared with the phenomena of the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf and its precur&s;ors and attendants. The uniform appearance of other epidemics, as introductory to pe&s;tilence, and manife&s;ting an e&s;&s;ential change in the atmo&s;phere, with the numerous ac|companiments of the plague and yellow fever, amounts to evi|dence of dome&s;tic origin, which leaves no room for cavil or controver&s;y.</P>
<P>For the purpo&s;e of collecting facts, the only &s;afe foundation of principles, and comparing the phenomena of di&s;ea&s;es and the elements, which occur nearly at the &s;ame time, in different coun|tries, I &s;incerely wi&s;h and reque&s;t that all medical and philo|&s;ophical &s;ocieties would undertake to regi&s;ter facts and recipro|cally to communicate them, by means of a general corre&s;pond|ence.

<P>Should the principles unfolded in the preceding work prove to be well founded, they will lead to many important practical in|ferences.</P>
<P N="1">I. If pe&s;tilential fevers never appear in the temperate latitudes, without certain precur&s;ors, men will, with careful ob&s;ervations, be enabled to fore&s;ee the danger and prepare for it; or to u&s;e un|common diligence in removing the &s;ubordinate local cau&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">II. If in certain years pe&s;tilential fevers are more predominant, than in others; and the condition of the elements fitted to pro|duce them, is univer&s;al over &s;ea and land, the fact is of no &s;mall moment in maritime affairs. Double precautions will be taken in fleets, and in merchantmen bound on long voyages.</P>
<P N="3">III. If pe&s;tilence is progre&s;&s;ive and fir&s;t manife&s;ted in certain malignant fevers, the fact may be of great utility to large cities. The approach may be perceived in time to &s;ave the inhabitants by flight, if not by other precautions.</P>
<P N="4">IV. If no plague or yellow fever ever appeared in temperate climates, unle&s;s announced by other di&s;tempers, the magi&s;tracy may be enabled to di&s;tingui&s;h when there is danger, and when
<PB N="280" REF="036687_0635_100AA5BC7B947CB8">
not; and may avoid innumerable vexations to commerce, ari&s;ing from the rigid execution of health laws, when there is not the lea&s;t occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="5">V. But a mo&s;t important u&s;e to be made of the facts here col|lected, will be, to guard public health from the ill effects of bad provi&s;ions. If, in pe&s;tilential periods, &s;alt is le&s;s efficacious in pre&s;erving fle&s;h, and by means of a greater fermentation of the juices, fi&s;h and fle&s;h are more readily di&s;&s;olved by a putre|factive proce&s;s, more caution will be found nece&s;&s;ary in packing and repacking them, and more care to avoid u&s;ing it in a bad &s;tate.</P>
<P>If the effluvia of di&s;&s;olving fle&s;h and vegetables are more poi|&s;onous and prejudicial to health at &s;ome times, than at others, it is of importance that, on every &s;uch occa&s;ion, early notice &s;hould be given of the danger.</P>
<P>If animals, which con&s;titute a part of the food of men, are &s;ubject to epidemic di&s;tempers, they cannot be eaten with &s;afety, while affected by di&s;ea&s;e. When fi&s;h or fowls are &s;ickly and many of them die, or become lean, the fact &s;hould be a&s;certained by the faculty or a board of health, and public notice &s;hould be given, that people might avoid u&s;ing them as food. In &s;ome in&s;tances, fi&s;h are &s;o &s;ickly as to excite nau&s;ea; in which ca&s;e the u&s;e of them &s;hould be forbidden.</P>
<P>I will clo&s;e this treati&s;e with the following reflections.</P>
<P>In the con&s;truction of the univer&s;e, we ob&s;erve every part of the &s;y&s;tem to be governed by uniform laws, adapted, with infi|nite &s;kill, to pre&s;erve harmony and order. Limited as our un|der&s;tandings are, we can di&s;cover many of the&s;e laws, which are calculated to impre&s;s on our minds the mo&s;t &s;ublime ideas of the univer&s;al intelligence and wi&s;dom of their Great Author.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of natural and moral evils has led &s;ceptics to que&s;tion the perfections of the author of nature. But doubts on this &s;ubject argue want of knowlege or want of candor. It is extremely evident that all the nece&s;&s;ary evils of the &s;y&s;tem are calculated to produce good. The operation of that univer&s;al principle of light, heat and fire, which pervades our &s;y&s;tem, and which is ince&s;&s;antly compounding and decompounding the other more &s;luggi&s;h materials of the earth and atmo&s;phere, are e&s;&s;en|tial
<PB N="281" REF="036687_0636_100AA5BEA1795600">
to the vici&s;&s;itudes of the &s;ea&s;ons, rain, &s;now, hail and dew, which are nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the principles of animal and vegetable life. Storms, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, however inconvenient to men at particular times and places, are among the means of giving to the principles of life, more equal di&s;tribution, and of renewing their energies.</P>
<P>Epidemic di&s;ea&s;es are &s;ome of the nece&s;&s;ary effects of the gen|eral laws that govern the univer&s;e. But they have al&s;o a final cau&s;e of immen&s;e value to the human race. They are de&s;tined and calculated to an&s;wer mo&s;t important moral and religious purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Men, with their pre&s;ent nature, under a con&s;tant cour&s;e of pro&s;perity, would degenerate into devils or brutes. Uninter|rupted ea&s;e and quiet contract the heart and &s;teel it again&s;t emo|tions of &s;en&s;ibility&mdash;the man ru&s;hes into vices and crimes, or &s;inks into &s;loth. So often have I &s;een the hearts of men depraved and their moral character deba&s;ed, by &s;udden pro&s;perity, that I am per&s;uaded the world, without frequent inflictions of pain and di&s;tre&s;s, would not be habitable. The natural evils that &s;urround us, intermingled with innumerable ble&s;&s;ings, pre&s;erve the mind in perpetual vigor, in &s;eeking the means of protection; they lay the foundation for the exerci&s;e of the fine&s;t feelings of the human heart, <HI>compa&s;&s;ion and benevolence,</HI> which are the &s;ources of &s;ocial virtue; they humble the pride and arrogance of man, by cre|ating in his mind a perpetual dependance on divine power; in &s;hort, they create and pre&s;erve that &s;en&s;e of obligation and ac|countability to God which is the germ of piety, and moral ex|cellence.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Lunar Influence.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a well known fact that the moon has a great influence on the elements of this globe, the effects of which are very vi&s;ible in the vici&s;&s;itudes of weather. This influence is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the principal regulator of the tides, and the efficient cau&s;e of the changes in the atmo&s;phere, which produce rain, hail, &s;now and wind. It is believed al&s;o to affect the growth of plants, and Pliny, followed by St. Pierre, alleges that the lunar rays di&s;&s;olve &s;now and ice. Popular opinion con&s;iders the moon as exerting a powerful influence on animal &s;ub&s;tances, and it is an incontrover|tible fact that its beams accelerate the putrefaction of fle&s;h and fi&s;h. Fi&s;hermen and &s;ailors can all atte&s;t this fact, and it coincides with what Pliny a&s;&s;erts. Nat. Hi&s;t. lib. 2. 101. "Id man|ife&s;tum e&s;&s;e, quod ferarum occi&s;a corpora in tabem vi&s;o &s;uo re&s;ol|vat."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Pierre affirms that the moon melts ice, and relies on the pa&s;&s;age of Pliny in the chapter cited, "glaciem refundat"&mdash;but it is que&s;tionable whether the pa&s;&s;age will bear that con&s;truction; and if it will, the a&s;|&s;ertion of Pliny is not &s;upported by modern ob&s;ervations. See Studies of Nature, Vol. 1. Expl. of the plates, p. 69. Ice is dimini&s;hed by evaporation in moon light, without forming water.</NOTE> Moon light di&s;&s;olves or corrupts the fle&s;h of animals that are killed; it renders &s;ound fi&s;h &s;oft in a few hours, and fi&s;hermen are careful to cover from its rays the fi&s;h they have caught. It probably acts upon fle&s;h by &s;timilus, exciting a fermentation in the juices.</P>
<P>The Newtonian theory of tides, which explains the phenom|ena by lunar attraction, has been recently called in que&s;tion and warmly oppo&s;ed by the ingenious St. Pierre, in his &s;tudies of na|ture, who &s;ub&s;titutes a &s;cheme of his own, which a&s;cribes the tides to the diurnal effu&s;ions of the polar ices. I am charmed with the writings of St. Pierre, which have opened a
<PB N="283" REF="036687_0638_100AA5C26E1512C8">
new and entertaining volume of the works of nature. But his theory of tides &s;eems to manife&s;t none of that ingenuity, which is con&s;picuous in other parts of his writings, and is utterly un|&s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, during &s;ix months or more, in each polar region, no &s;now or ice is melted, unle&s;s by the moon. The &s;un is below the horizon, and the moon's influence, if it di&s;&s;olves &s;now and ice according to Pliny, evaporates all the water pro|duced. This is a fact that accords with modern experiments, that ice in the night, however cold, lo&s;es a part of its weight, but it is by in&s;en&s;ible evaporation.</P>
<P>To remove this difficulty, St. Pierre &s;uppo&s;es the tides in one polar region to be the effect of the melting of &s;now and ice, in the oppo&s;ite polar regions. But to this hypothe&s;is we may oppo&s;e an in&s;uperable objection, derived from the great and univer&s;al laws of equilibrium, ob&s;erved by water. A diurnal wave or ele|vation would inevitably &s;ub&s;ide into a level, before it could reach the equator, or even the temperate latitudes. Be&s;ides the Atlan|tic is of very various breadth, in different latitudes. Between the coa&s;t of Brazil and Terra Firma on one &s;ide and Africa on the other, the breadth is &s;carcely half as great, as in the latitude of 25 deg. north. A diurnal wave compre&s;&s;ed and dilated, in the&s;e different &s;ituations, mu&s;t exhibit the tides in one place, twice as high as in another; but in the regions mentioned, this is not the fact.</P>
<P>There are many of the phenomena of the tides which cannot be explained on St. Pierre's hypothe&s;is; but the foregoing re|marks are &s;ufficient for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. The tides doubtle&s;s depend on lunar and &s;olar influence; but the phenomena cannot be &s;olved on the common theory of <HI>attraction.</HI> In this re&s;pect, I am confident the Newtonian theory, as explained by Kepler and others is as inadequate, as that of St. Pierre. The latter author has enumerated &s;ome in&s;uperable objections to that theory, to which the reader is referred. But I have other ob&s;ervations to make on this &s;ubject, which are probably new.</P>
<P>The manner in which a&s;tronomers have attempted to explain the oppo&s;ite tides, is as follows. "The power of gravity dimin|i&s;hes as the &s;quare of the di&s;tance increa&s;es&mdash;therefore the waters
<PB N="284" REF="036687_0639_100AA5C5C9A9E468">
on the &s;ide of the earth next to the moon, are more attracted than the central parts of the earth; and the central parts are more attracted by the moon than the waters on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the earth&mdash;therefore the di&s;tance between the earth's center and the waters on its &s;urface, under and oppo&s;ite to the moon, will be increa&s;ed. The earth by its gravity falls towards the moon &mdash;the water directly below the moon ri&s;es and &s;wells towards her &mdash;the water on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide recedes from the center and ri|&s;es&mdash; or &s;trictly &s;peaking, the center recedes from the water. On the &s;ides of the earth between the points under and oppo&s;ite to the moon, the water is depre&s;&s;ed and falls below the former level."</P>
<BIBL>See Fergu&s;ons's A&s;tronony, on the Tides, and Encyclopedia, Art. A&s;tronomy, 363.</BIBL>
<P>As I am not about engaging in a&s;tronomical or mathematical calculations, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with &s;tating the&s;e general prin|ciples of Newton, Kepler, and later a&s;tronomers, with a few objections.</P>
<P N="1">I. This theory does not explain, in a &s;atisfactory manner, the rea&s;on why there are no tides in lakes and Mediterranean &s;eas.</P>
<P>If the principle is ju&s;t, that the earth recedes from the water oppo&s;ite to the moon, leaving the &s;urface of it at a greater di&s;|tance from the center, why, when the Euxine or Mediterranean is oppo&s;ite to the moon, does not the earth beneath the&s;e &s;eas, re|cede from <HI>their</HI> waters, as well as from the waters of the ocean, in the &s;ame longitude? The earth con&s;i&s;ts of &s;olid &s;ub&s;tances, and by the laws of attraction, mu&s;t, in all its parts, be moved equal|ly, under the &s;ame circum&s;tances of di&s;tance from the attracting body and den&s;ity, or &s;olid contents. To &s;uppo&s;e the earth, when covered by an ocean, to be attracted by the moon, and not when covered by a lake or arm of the ocean, is, in my view, neither logic nor philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Nor is the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for the defect of tides in lakes and &s;eas, on the &s;ide next to the moon, in the lea&s;t &s;atisfactory. It is found in the Encyclopedia in the&s;e words. "There are no tides in lakes becau&s;e they are generally &s;o &s;mall, that when the moon is vertical &s;he attracts every part of them alike, and therefore by rendering all the water equally light, no part of it can be rai&s;ed higher than another."</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="036687_0640_100AA5C7507BCD88">But this explanation does not meet the difficulty. The New|tonian theory &s;tands on the hypothe&s;is that the waters on the &s;ide of the earth next to the moon, are more &s;trongly attracted than the adjacent land; therefore they ri&s;e above &s;everal feet of the earth. But the &s;olution above recited does not reach this point; for the waters of the ocean ri&s;e <HI>higher</HI> than the contiguous earth; but the waters of lakes always ob&s;erve the &s;ame relative altitude on their &s;hores. If then the moon attracts the waters of lakes at all, or occa&s;ions them to ri&s;e, it attracts the adjoining earth and rai&s;es it in the &s;ame degree as the waters; but in regard to the ocean, it attracts the water and leaves the contiguous earth behind. In &s;hort, if attraction and gravity have uniform laws, as we mu&s;t believe they have, the attraction of the moon will not account for tides in the ocean, while there are none in lakes and inland &s;eas.</P>
<P N="2">II. If the moon's attraction is the cau&s;e of tides, why is its force much le&s;s in the equatorial regions, than in the di&s;tant parts of the globe? It is a well known fact, that the tides within the tropics are very &s;mall, and that they are more con|&s;iderable as we recede from the equator towards the poles. This is contrary to what ought to be the ca&s;e, on the principles of at|traction; for on the Newtonian theory of gravity, the highe&s;t tides &s;hould be on the parts of the earth neare&s;t to the moon. The rever&s;e of this is the ca&s;e, and the circumpolar regions of the earth have the highe&s;t tides. The tides within the tropics are from 12 to 24 inches&mdash;in the latitude of Greenland, al|mo&s;t as many feet.</P>
<P N="3">III. The theory of Newton is not reconcileable with his own principles of gravity, which &s;uppo&s;e the force of it to be equal to the quantity of matter contained in bodies. Now the theory implies that on the &s;ide of the earth next to the moon, the water is attracted <HI>more</HI> than the earth; but on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, <HI>le&s;s.</HI> This cannot be &s;olved on the principle of <HI>di&s;tance;</HI> for this is too &s;mall to account for a hundredth part of the effect. Indeed the water and the land on the &s;hore, may be con&s;idered as at the &s;ame di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Nor can it be &s;olved on the principle of a difference in the quantity of matter, in earth and water. If the earth, having
<PB N="286" REF="036687_0641_100AA5C95E0977E8">
more den&s;ity and matter, is mo&s;t attracted, the principle mu&s;t act uniformly on both &s;ides of the earth&mdash;on both &s;ides, the earth mu&s;t move towards the moon further than the water, which is contrary to fact.</P>
<P>If the water has mo&s;t matter, the &s;ame principle mu&s;t govern it on both &s;ides of the earth, and move it farthe&s;t towards the moon.</P>
<P>But here the principles of cohe&s;ion interfere with all the&s;e deductions. The&s;e principles are &s;o powerful, as to overcome the attraction of a di&s;tant body, nor is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the power of the moon overcomes the force of cohe&s;ion, and by attracting the parts of the earth next to it more than the parts on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, changes the form of the earth from a &s;phere to a &s;pheroid. It is not &s;uppo&s;ed that the whole &s;olid ma&s;s of the earth is continually changing its figure by means of lunar attrac|tion. If &s;o, this figure mu&s;t be rotatory.</P>
<P>The theory then &s;uppo&s;es that on the &s;ide next to the moon, the water is mo&s;t &s;trongly attracted and ri&s;es above the earth&mdash; but on the &s;ide oppo&s;ite, it is attracted le&s;s than the earth. The &s;olid globe is moved towards the moon, and the water left lag|ging behind! What is more &s;ingular, the earth near the equa|tor, on the &s;ide oppo&s;ite, is drawn only two feet further towards the moon than the water, or perhaps but one foot; while in the temperate latitudes, it is drawn &s;ix or eight feet, and in the lat|itudes of 60 and 70 degrees, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty-five feet further than th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> water. This may be philo&s;ophy, but to me it is utterly unintelligible!</P>
<P>Nothing is a more &s;erious misfortune to &s;cience, than the er|rors of a great man. Mo&s;t of mankind take principles and facts upon tru&s;t, and defend them with a zeal proportioned to their confidence in the man who has publi&s;hed them. I revere the character of Newton, of Kepler and of Haller; but this vene|ration does not in the lea&s;t incline me to receive their doctrins without being convinced that they are well founded. After mo&s;t careful inve&s;tigation, I am &s;atisfied, that the principles of at|traction, will not account for the tides oppo&s;ite to the moon, nor for the difference between the height of the tides in differ|ent
<PB N="287" REF="036687_0642_100AA5CB0D616658">
latitudes. Yet I have not the lea&s;t doubt, that mo&s;t of the phenomena of tides are regulated by the moon.</P>
<P>If I was a&s;ked, on what principles the tides depend, my an|&s;wer would be, <HI>I do not know.</HI> But numerous facts, all con|curring to the &s;ame point, lead me to <HI>&s;u&s;pect</HI> the vibrations of the ocean to depend on electricity, influenced by the moon, the &s;un, or other di&s;tant orbs, and acting by repul&s;ion as well as at|traction; or by increa&s;ing and dimini&s;hing the ela&s;ticity of the water.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is agreed among philo&s;ophers, that the air, when free from vapor, is an electric; that when cold, it is mo&s;t electric, and when heated, it becomes a conductor; and con&s;equently that the atmo&s;phere in the torrid zone is always in a conducting &s;tate, while the air of the northern regions, if clear, is an electric. In &s;hort, it is agreed that the atmo&s;phere of the temperate and frigid zones contains more electricity, than that of the torrid zone.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts corre&s;pond with the phenomena of tides. In the regions, where there is the lea&s;t electricity, there is the lea&s;t intume&s;cence of the ocean&mdash;tho&s;e are the equatorial regions. There, the temperature of the air al&s;o &s;u&s;tains very &s;mall varia|tions; &s;o does the height of the ocean. As we recede from the equator cold and electricity increa&s;e; &s;o does the elevation of the tides.</P>
<P>Again, the &s;ame train of phenomena attend the barometer. Within the tropics, the variations of the mercury in this in|&s;trument, are very &s;mall; but in the temperate and cold regions, they are more con&s;iderable, and increa&s;e as we recede from a warm to a cold and electric atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Similar phenomena attend the twilight. Within the tropics, the twilight is of much le&s;s duration, than in cold regions. "Heat, &s;ay philo&s;ophers, dimini&s;hes the air's refractive power and den&s;ity, and cold increa&s;es both. The horizontal refrac|tions are near one third le&s;s at the equator, than at Paris."</P>
<BIBL>Fergu&s;on's A&s;tron. 97.</BIBL>
<P>The den&s;ity of the atmo&s;phere, within the tropics, may be le&s;s than at the polar circle; but the weight is nearly the &s;ame, the barometer being in general as high at the equator, as in north|ern
<PB N="288" REF="036687_0643_100AA5CE78945830">
latitudes. But the air, in hot climates, has le&s;s powers of refraction; that is, there is more power of refraction in an at|mo&s;phere that is mo&s;t perfectly electric, or that contains mo&s;t electricity.</P>
<P>It is remarkable al&s;o that, in equatorial climates, the atmo&s;|phere exhibits no vi&s;ible &s;treams of electricity; as it does in the polar circles.</P>
<P>I know not how far this parallel may be extended; but there is a &s;urpri&s;ing re&s;emblance between all the&s;e phenomena. In general then we ob&s;erve that in the equatorial regions, the den|&s;ity, weight, ela&s;ticity and temperature of the atmo&s;phere, are more nearly uniform, than in northern climates; and the eleva|tion of the ocean in tides corre&s;ponds with this uniformity. As we recede from the equator, the variations of the atmo&s;phere increa&s;e, and &s;o do the variations in the height and depre&s;&s;ion of the water.</P>
<P>From the&s;e phenomena a &s;u&s;picion ari&s;es, that the medium by which the moon and &s;un act upon the ocean, is the electrical fluid; as their influence appears to be in proportion to the elec|tricity of the atmo&s;phere. Hence the highe&s;t tides at a di&s;tance from the equator, where the heat and cold and ela&s;ticity of the air are &s;ubject to great variations.</P>
<P>By what law, it will be a&s;ked, is this effect produced? I readily confe&s;s my ignorance. But the phenomena of oppo&s;ite tides &s;eem to bear a great affinity to the well known laws of electricity, <HI>attraction</HI> and <HI>repul&s;ion,</HI> and a <HI>po&s;itive</HI> and <HI>negative</HI> &s;tate. I pretend not to account for the phenomena, for I am per&s;uaded that the experiments on electricity which man is ca|pable of making, will never unfold <HI>all</HI> its properties, nor explain <HI>all</HI> the laws by which this energy of nature is exerted in the government of the material &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>But the influence of the planets on the elements of this globe has, in all ages, been a &s;ubject of belief or of deri&s;ion; and &s;urely it is a &s;ubject in phy&s;ics much more intere&s;ting to man, than many &s;peculative que&s;tions which cannot affect his health and happine&s;s, but which occupy the labors of inve&s;tigating minds. I will therefore throw together a few ob&s;ervations
<PB N="289" REF="036687_0644_100AA5D001CB2AE0">
which may afford light on the &s;ubject; or at lea&s;t may excite a &s;pirit of enquiry.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is generally known and admitted that the influence of the &s;un and moon upon this globe are in proportion to their proximity. The highe&s;t tides are when the moon is in her perigee, and in conjunction with the &s;un, and e&s;pecially when the earth is in her perihelion, or neare&s;t to the &s;un. But the moon exerts more than u&s;ual influence on the atmo&s;phere, in other po&s;itions. Her power is greate&s;t in her perigee and apo|gee, and in her conjunction and oppo&s;ition to the &s;un. Her in|fluence on the tides, under the combined and &s;eparate operations of the&s;e circum&s;tances, has been fully illu&s;trated. But her in|fluence on vegetation, on the vici&s;&s;itudes of weather, on health, and the phenomena of the electrical fluid in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, &s;eems to have pa&s;&s;ed unob&s;erved, or at lea&s;t, to have never been reduced to any thing like &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t &s;triking effects of lunar influence, is ob&s;erv|able in earthquakes, which u&s;ually happen near the time of the moon's perigee or apogee, conjunction or oppo&s;ition. As this fact &s;eems to have e&s;caped ob&s;ervation, I will here in&s;ert proof of it.</P>

<P>The&s;e two la&s;t in&s;tances, according to another almanac, hap|pened <HI>one</HI> day after the perigee and apogee. I have not taken pains to enter into <HI>exact</HI> calculations of the moon's place, as I do not deem it material. It is &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e that <HI>almo&s;t all</HI> earthquakes happen near the time of the moon's conjunction and oppo&s;ition, or her perigee and apogee. Of the&s;e po&s;itions, it is obvious that her perigee and apogee have much the mo&s;t in|fluence; and the in&s;tances I have examined are almo&s;t equally divided between the&s;e two po&s;itions. Of all the earthquakes which I have compared with the moon's place, one or two only fall in her quadratures, and at her mean di&s;tance from the earth. An in&s;tance happened on the 11th of April 1799 in Carolina. I have compared &s;everal other in&s;tances, which happened near the perigee and apogee, but it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;pecify them. The examples mentioned will e&s;tabli&s;h the generality of the fact, and the &s;oundne&s;s of the principle.</P>
<P>On the principles of <HI>attraction,</HI> it will readily be admitted that the proximity of the moon to the earth, at certain periods of her
<PB N="291" REF="036687_0646_100AA5D3122EC130">
revolution, mu&s;t <HI>draw,</HI> or excite into action and di&s;charge, the electricity, of the earth. This accounts for earthquakes during the moon's perigee. But on enquiry we find a great proportion of the &s;hocks take place during her apogee, when her di&s;tance is greate&s;t and her &s;uppo&s;ed power the lea&s;t; and not only &s;o, but during her oppo&s;ition to the &s;un, when her <HI>dimini&s;hed</HI> influ|ence is &s;uppo&s;ed to be counteracted and &s;till <HI>further dimini&s;hed</HI> by the attraction of the &s;un. This is an important fact and de&s;erves inve&s;tigation. That the influence of the moon is the direct ex|citing cau&s;e of earthquakes, can hardly be que&s;tioned, after e&s;|tabli&s;hing the fact, that four out of five, or a much larger pro|portion, happen when &s;he is in particular parts of her orbit; but why her greate&s;t di&s;tance and her lea&s;t, &s;hould produce exactly the &s;ame effects, a fact equally well e&s;tabli&s;hed, is a que&s;tion which can perhaps be &s;olved only on electrical principles.</P>
<P>That the electricity of the atmo&s;phere and earth, is the medi|um by which the moon acts upon the elements of the globe, is rendered probable by another fact. I po&s;&s;e&s;s the exact dates of very few volcanic eruptions; but by comparing &s;uch as I have, with the moon's place in her orbit, I find the&s;e eruptions begin or &s;uffer violent exacerbations, at the time the moon is in her pe|rigee or apogee; or in her conjunction or oppo&s;ition.</P>

<P>A dark day on the 9th of Augu&s;t 1732 was about the time of the new moon, and her apogee. The dark day at Detroit Octo|ber 16, 1762 was the day after her perigee, and one day be|fore the change.</P>

<P>The great eruption of Ve&s;uvius and the earthquake, which bu|ried Herculaneum, on the 1&s;t of November A. D. 79, were the &s;econd day after her perigee.</P>
<P>The influence of the moon in producing &s;torms of rain, &s;now and wind, is univer&s;ally admitted; and that the&s;e happen near the po&s;itions of the moon already de&s;cribed, no man will under|take to deny. The We&s;t-Indians expect hurricanes only near the time of the full and new moon; or her perigee and apogee. This is further evidence that the electrical fluid is the in&s;trument of the&s;e commotions in the atmo&s;phere. Electricity is known to be the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e of winds, and its agency is vi&s;ible in producing hurricanes; for experienced &s;eamen foretel a hurricane by the unu&s;ual tran&s;parency of the water. Now it is a well known fact that electricity po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;ingular property of giving tran&s;|parency to opaque bodies.</P>
<P>A little before a hurricane in the We&s;t-Indies, &s;eamen can &s;ee the lead, at an unu&s;ual depth; the &s;ea al&s;o &s;wells and rolls upon the &s;hore in a &s;ingular manner, tho the air is perfectly tran|quil. An efferve&s;cence al&s;o or bubbling is ob&s;erved in the wa|ter. Dark clouds are formed, and the atmo&s;phere, before the tempe&s;t, is ob&s;erved by vapors &s;en&s;ibly mephitic. See a letter from Gov. Ellis, dated March 6, 1789, in the 9th vol. of Mu&s;eum, 215. Hence we ob&s;erve the correctne&s;s of the com|mon &s;aying among &s;eamen, that "hurricanes come out of the
<PB N="293" REF="036687_0648_100AA5D8B7A04F88">
&s;ea." They are evidently generated by extraordinary di&s;char|ges of electricity. Hence they are mo&s;t frequent in the wind|ward i&s;lands, which are all volcanic; &s;ome of them &s;till di&s;char|ging fire and &s;moke at times, and all of them evidently re&s;ting on a volcanic ba&s;e.</P>
<P>Further, that electricity is the great agent in the&s;e agitations of the elements is rendered probable by the coincidences in time, between the more violent hurricanes, and great volcanic di&s;|charges from Etna, Ve&s;uvius and Iceland. Witne&s;s the terrible hurricanes of 1747, 1766, 1772, 1780, 1784 and 5, all of which happened near the time of great eruptions from the volca|noes mentioned; all of which are di&s;tingui&s;hed in the annals of the Antilles, and &s;till recollected with horror by the inhabitants. And this circum&s;tance is no incon&s;iderable evidence, that the agent in volcanic eruptions, as well as in hurricanes, is electrici|ty, and that this element is often di&s;turbed or ejected from the whole globe, nearly at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the great tempe&s;ts, in all latitudes, happen near the moon's perigee and apogee; and in the&s;e po&s;itions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e ob&s;erve e&s;&s;ential changes in the temperature of the atmo&s;phere. I have taken &s;ome pains to compare the changes in heat and cold, with the&s;e po&s;itions of the moon, with a view to learn, whether the effects are uniform. On examining the &s;tate of the thermometer for two years, I find that, in almo&s;t every in&s;tance of the moon's perigee and apogee, e&s;pecially in winter, there was a con&s;idera|ble change of temperature. U&s;ually the weather grew colder, as the moon approached her perigee. But the effects were not uniform; &s;ometimes the weather became more temperate, at the perigee. But one general remark will be found true; that in re|gard to heat and cold, the moon's apogee and perigee produce, at different times, preci&s;ely the &s;ame effects. This remark ac|cords with what has before been ob&s;erved in regard to earth|quakes.</P>
<P>It is a general remark that the weather becomes cooler as the moon approaches the change. Should this remark prove to be well founded, the re&s;ult would be this principle, that the cold is increa&s;ed, or rather the heat le&s;&s;ened, by the combined influence
<PB N="294" REF="036687_0649_100AA5DAECCB7BC8">
of the &s;un and moon. This principle would accord with another ob&s;ervation ju&s;t made, that the weather is cooler, during the moon's perigee, which is generally true in winter. That is, the greater power is exerted by di&s;tant orbs on our atmo&s;phere, the more the heat is dimini&s;hed. But this ob&s;ervation is not univer|&s;ally true. It is true that our winter occurs during the earth's perihelion; but this is u&s;ually explained on the principle of the obliquity of the &s;un's rays&mdash;a &s;olution that perhaps is not com|pletely &s;atisfactory, altho, to a certain degree, it is doubtle&s;s ju&s;t.</P>
<P>It is a popular opinion that vegetation is le&s;s rapid, and the fle&s;h of animals le&s;s firm and &s;ub&s;tantial, and new &s;hooting plants le&s;s vigorous, during the wane of the moon, than during her in|crement. This opinion is too general and too re&s;pectable, to be con&s;idered the fruit of ignorance and credulity.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle alleges that the clo&s;e of the lunar month is cooler than the other parts of it; and that during the decrea&s;e of the moon, the bodies of living animals po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s heat than at other times. De gener. animal. lib. 2. 4. The&s;e remarks, whether true or not, coincide with the modern popular opinion ju&s;t re|cited.</P>
<P>We are apt to neglect the opinions and practices of barbarous nations, and to hold in contempt the knowlege of ancient na|tions. This often happens, I &s;u&s;pect, becau&s;e we are le&s;s wi&s;e, than tho&s;e whom we affect to de&s;pi&s;e. Ce&s;ar in his fir&s;t book of the Gallic war, chapter 40, relates, that the ancient Germans, who were great ob&s;ervers of the pha&s;es of the moon, declined engaging in battle, during the wane of that planet. He had of|fered battle to Ariovi&s;tus, but this commander declined a general action, and permitted only &s;kirmi&s;hes. Ce&s;ar enquired of his pri&s;oners the rea&s;on of this conduct, and was told that it was cu&s;tomary with the Germans to con&s;ult their venerable matrons, who, by means of lots and divination, pronounced on the pro|priety of giving battle; and the&s;e had declared that it was not po&s;&s;ible for the Germans to conquer, if they engaged in action before the new moon. "Non e&s;&s;e fas Germanos &s;uperare, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i ante novam lunam praelio contendi&s;&s;ent." See Ce&s;ar's Com|mentaries,

in the pa&s;&s;age cited, and Henry's Hi&s;tory of Bri|tain, vol. 1. ch. 4.</P>
<P>We have this cu&s;tom of the Germans pre&s;ented to us, di&s;|gui&s;ed with &s;uper&s;tition; but I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect it had its origin in the ob&s;ervation of the fact, mentioned by Ari&s;totle, that in the decrea&s;e of the moon, animal bodies have le&s;s heat and vigor.</P>
<P>I am the more inclined to believe this, becau&s;e the doctrin ac|cords with modern ob&s;ervations concerning the inva&s;ion of fevers, and e&s;pecially of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es. Many medical authors concur in the fact, that di&s;ea&s;es more generally attack the human body on the &s;econd or third day before the new or full moon. On examining the accounts of &s;everal writers, I find the times of inva&s;ion to be two or three days before or after the new and full moon, or about the time of its conjunction with the &s;un. See Jack&s;on, Grainger, Lind and many other authors.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck is explicit on this point. He relates that in the plague of 1636, "two or three days before and after the new and full moon, the di&s;ea&s;e was more violent; more per&s;ons were &s;eized at tho&s;e times, than at others; and tho&s;e who were then &s;eized, almo&s;t all died, in a very &s;hort time. Many patients who appeared before to be &s;lightly affected, <HI>ne&s;cio qua virium labefac|tione oppre&s;&s;i,</HI> &s;ays the author, by an unaccountable decline of &s;trength, &s;unk and died in a few hours."</P>
<BIBL>De pe&s;te, page 9.</BIBL>
<P>From the ob&s;ervations of phy&s;icians it then appears, that this debility of the animal powers takes place near the time of the con|junction and oppo&s;ition of the &s;un and moon; near the moon's perigee and apogee; and in the &s;ame po&s;itions in which earth|quakes and &s;torms more generally occur.</P>
<P>Of the reality of this effect of the elements on the body, there can be no rational doubts. About the time of the change of the atmo&s;phere, which indicates an approaching rain or &s;torm, per|&s;ons of debilitated habits of body, perceive the change, by a lo&s;s of vivacity, dulne&s;s or heavine&s;s; parts of the body that have lo&s;t their natural energy by means of wounds and tumors expe|rience painful or unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, by which &s;torms are often pre|dicted.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="036687_0651_100AA6546F1FA110">Fowls perceive this change in the atmo&s;phere, and manife&s;t their &s;en&s;ations. Candles &s;parkle and &s;nap; the tallow melts more freely, and the flame is le&s;s &s;teady. The&s;e things were ob|&s;erved by Ari&s;totle and Pliny.</P>
<P>This change in the atmo&s;phere is not only perceptible by the &s;en&s;e of feeling, but becomes vi&s;ible. Di&s;tant objects &s;een over water, and &s;ome writers &s;ay, over land al&s;o, <HI>loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e, or appear elevated, &s;everal degrees, above their u&s;ual altit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. The ear al&s;o will aid us in foretelling rain and wind; for &s;ounds become audible at an unu&s;ual di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons in full health are not &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e changes in the elements; at lea&s;t, they are not &s;o much affected, as to ob&s;erve them. But from many years ob&s;ervation, I am convinced, that the catarrhal affections, which pa&s;s under the popular name of <HI>colds,</HI> are occa&s;ioned by the alterations in the atmo&s;phere which precede changes of weather, and few of them from the applica|tion of cold. I know this to be the ca&s;e with my&s;elf; tho&s;e pha&s;es of the moon, which have been mentioned as producing great effects on the earth and atmo&s;phere, rarely pa&s;s, without affecting me with &s;light catarrh. This has been remarkably the ca&s;e, &s;ince the fever of 1798, which left me in a &s;tate of debility. But many per&s;ons can atte&s;t the truth of the principle; nothing being more common than for per&s;ons to remark, that they can|not tell how they took cold; and it being well known that ca|tarrhs are more general and &s;evere, on the tran&s;itions from cold to heat, than from heat to cold. The ob&s;truction of the glands is evidently the effect of an in&s;en&s;ible change in the atmo&s;phere, probably by means of the decompo&s;ition of the electricity and the vapor or other elementary &s;ub&s;tances of the atmo&s;phere. And the winds to which we a&s;cribe the changes of weather are un|que&s;tionably an <HI>effect,</HI> rather than a <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of tho&s;e changes.</P>
<P>The&s;e alterations in the atmo&s;phere appear to have &s;ome con|nection with the tides; or rather with the cau&s;e of tides. It is &s;aid by &s;eamen and other ob&s;ervers of the &s;ea&s;ons, that full tides are apt to produce rain; that rain which begins at high water will cea&s;e, with the rece&s;s of the tide; but rain beginning at low water, will be of con&s;iderable duration. The&s;e and other ob&s;er|vations,
<PB N="297" REF="036687_0652_100AA5DFEE446410">
if ju&s;t, manife&s;t an influence of the tides over the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, or a dependence of both on one common cau&s;e&mdash;the &s;ame invi&s;ible energy of electricity producing both effects.</P>
<P>It is a known fact that the flowing tide often brings with it a breeze of wind. This is a&s;cribed to the friction of the water on the air, and the cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned may be &s;ufficient to account for the phenomenon. But it may be &s;ugge&s;ted whether the electricity of the atmo&s;phere, may not produce both the tide and the wind. The intume&s;cence of the ocean, previous to earthquakes and hurricanes, which are evidently occa&s;ioned by electricity, &s;eems to bear a great analogy to the tides and to authorize my &s;u&s;picions. The &s;well of the ocean during earthquakes, has u&s;ually been a&s;|cribed to the rai&s;ing of the land beneath it; but this cannot be the cau&s;e, for &s;uch a &s;welling of the land never takes place over whole continents. The &s;well of the water is probably the effect of the ela&s;tic powers of the electricity di&s;charged, operating on the water it&s;elf.</P>
<P>There are many diurnal and periodical phenomena, which are evidently connected with the lunar and &s;olar influence, and de|&s;erve t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e mentioned in this place.</P>
<P>It is a well a&s;certained fact, that in the tropics, where the weight of the atmo&s;phere is &s;ubject to very &s;mall variations, the barometer uniformly ri&s;es and falls with the tides, about two thirds of a line. Encyclop. <HI>art. wind.</HI> This is a &s;mall varia|tion. But,</P>
<P>It is al&s;o a&s;&s;erted that, in tho&s;e regions, "the variations in the gravity of the atmo&s;phere &s;eem to depend on the heat of the &s;un, as the barometer con&s;tantly &s;inks near <HI>half an inch</HI> every day, and ri&s;es again to its former &s;tation in the night."

rever&s;ed; ri&s;ing with augmented cold and &s;inking with an increa&s;e of heat. But this is not the fact. The barometer often ri&s;es with the increa&s;e of heat, between &s;un-ri&s;e and twelve o'clock. Heat therefore cannot be the direct cau&s;e of the di|urnal depre&s;&s;ion of the barometer in the equatorial climates; un|le&s;s it has different laws, in different latitudes, which philo&s;ophy will not admit.</P>
<P>Let us compare the facts &s;tated with the known phenomenon of the different forces of water, during the day and the night. The water-wheel of any mill, the altitude of the water and the re&s;i&s;|tance being preci&s;ely the &s;ame, makes more revolutions, in a min|ute, during the night, than in the day time. I have long been acquainted with the fact, and it is known to every miller; but as I have never &s;een a &s;tatement of it in any philo&s;ophical work, I have had the curio&s;ity to make an accurate experiment to a&s;cer|tain the difference. This was done on the night after the 28th of May 1799; the weather being perfectly &s;erene, the air free from vapor, not a breath of wind &s;tirring to ruffle the water, and the barometer, on the evening preceding, at half pa&s;t eight, &s;tanding at 30 and one tenth.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ob&s;ervation was made at a quarter before 7 P. M. &s;ometime before &s;un &s;et, the thermometer &s;tanding at 65 deg. when the wheel of the mill made exactly 16 revolutions in a minute. The altitude of the water was marked with preci&s;ion; but the delivery of the water not having been exactly adju&s;ted to the current entering the pond, the water ro&s;e, and at 9 o'clock had half an inch of altitude beyond the mark. By this means, my ob&s;ervation at that hour was lo&s;t. By rai&s;ing another gate, the water was reduced to its former altitude, and by twelve o'clock the di&s;charge of the water was exactly equal to the cur|rent, and from that time to &s;unri&s;e, the altitude continued the &s;ame.</P>
<P>At twelve o'clock and from that hour to three, the wheel made 17&frac12; revolutions in a minute; the ob&s;ervations being often repeated, without a &s;en&s;ible variation of re&s;ults. Soon after three o'clock, a &s;mall acceleration was perceptible, but it did not amount to half a revolution, until about half pa&s;t three, when

the wheel made 18 revolutions in a minute, which accelerated movement continued till half pa&s;t four, when, being near &s;un ri&s;e, the ob&s;ervations were di&s;continued. During the la&s;t ob&s;ervations, I perceived a very &s;mall retardation of movement, but it did not amount to half a revolution. To prevent any difference of re|&s;i&s;tence in the mill, not the &s;lighte&s;t alteration was made in the elevation of the &s;tone, or the quantity of wheat delivered from the hopper, from the beginning to the end of the ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>I had not a barometer with me at the mill, but about eight o'clock, on the following day, the barometer &s;tood about one twentieth of an inch higher, than on the preceding evening. The thermometer fell, during the night, to 54 deg.</P>
<P>From this experiment, it is obvious that the weight of the at|mo&s;phere could not be the &s;ole cau&s;e of the acceleration of the wheel. The acceleration at twelve o'clock was almo&s;t an <HI>elev|enth</HI>&mdash;at a later hour, a <HI>ninth</HI> of the whole movement. The in|crea&s;ed gravity of the atmo&s;phere will not account for a tenth of the difference.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t then re&s;ort to other principles for a &s;olution of the phenomenon. It is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed that water is a non|compre&s;&s;ible &s;ub&s;tance; but this opinion has been ju&s;tly que&s;tion|ed. However this may be, I have little he&s;itation in re&s;olving the phenomenon of the water-wheel into its increa&s;ed ela&s;ticity during the night. How or why the &s;ubduction of light and heat &s;hould produce or increa&s;e this property in water, I leave for electricians to determin. The effect cannot be a&s;cribed to the increa&s;ed gravity of water, during the night, for no &s;uch increa&s;e is ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>It is an ob&s;ervation of &s;eamen that &s;hips make more way in the water, by night than by day, with the &s;ame force of wind. I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect that the moi&s;ture on the &s;ails might, in a de|gree, contribute to this effect; but it mu&s;t be recollected that in rainy days there is no difference in the moi&s;ture of the air by night and by day. Can the effect then be a&s;cribed to the cau&s;e that accelerates the movement of water-wheels by night&mdash;an in|crea&s;ed ela&s;ticity? If the gravity and den&s;ity of water were augmented during the night, the&s;e would render the water more

buoyant, but retard the motion of a &s;hip, by increa&s;ing the re|&s;i&s;tance. We are therefore driven to the &s;ame hypothe&s;is, an increa&s;e of ela&s;ticity, which renders water more buoyant when at re&s;t, and more impre&s;&s;ive when in motion, without an augmented den&s;ity and weight. But I am not &s;ure that the moi&s;ture of the air will not account for the whole effect.</P>
<P>If the ela&s;tic power of water is increa&s;ed by the ab&s;traction of heat, does it not follow that this power mu&s;t be greater as we recede from the equator; and of cour&s;e, any given force applied to the water in different latitudes, will occa&s;ion a vibration of that fluid, proportioned to its ela&s;ticity. Hence the &s;mall tides within the tropics, where the heat is nearly uniform; and the high tides in the northern regions, where the vibrations in the temperature of the atmo&s;phere, are more con&s;iderable. Yet facts do not permit us to a&s;cribe this ela&s;ticity to cold. It is more probably owing to the quantity of electricity, or to its pe|culiar combination with aerial &s;ub&s;tances, of which cold is the effect. Perhaps the following ob&s;ervations will throw &s;ome light on this &s;ubject. Ari&s;totle and after him, Pliny a&s;&s;erted that no animal dies, except during the ebb tide. "Nullum animal ni&s;i ae&s;tu recedente expirare. Ob&s;ervatum id multum in Gallico O|ceano, et duntaxat in homine compertum." Pliny, Nat. Hi&s;t. lib. 2. 98. "No animal dies, except during the rece&s;s of the tide. This is particularly ob&s;erved on the coa&s;t of Gaul; and is at lea&s;t true with re&s;pect to man."</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of this ob&s;ervation is probably too general; but modern facts confirm the a&s;&s;ertion, within certain limitations. A late mini&s;ter at Barrie in Scotland, contiguous to the German &s;ea, made a &s;imilar remark, after fifty years ob&s;ervation.</P>
<BIBL>Sinclair, vol. 4. 240.</BIBL>
<P>The rea&s;on why Pliny has &s;pecified the coa&s;t of France, as remarkable for the fact &s;tated, is very obvious. France lies on the main ocean, and the time of high and low water is the true time. On the coa&s;t of Italy, where there are no tides, the ob|&s;ervation could not be made; and if made by the time of ebb tide in rivers and bays, it would not be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Another remark made by phy&s;icians, is, that <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI>
<PB N="301" REF="036687_0656_100AA5E89C5791C8">
more per&s;ons die during the latter part of the night, than at any other time in the &s;olar day. This remark has not come to me from a &s;ufficient number of ob&s;ervations to command full belief; but it accords with a few ob&s;ervations of my own. If univer|&s;ally true, it would contradict in part the remark of Ari&s;totle and Pliny; but it is po&s;&s;ible, both remarks may be true with certain limitations. The fact may be more obvious, when ebb tide hap|pens between midnight and &s;unri&s;e; and le&s;s &s;o, when flood tide happens at that period; that is, under the combined or &s;eparate operation of the two cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Other facts lend their aid to &s;upport the ob&s;ervation that &s;ome e&s;&s;ential change in the properties of the atmo&s;phere takes place, in the latter part of the night. This is the time when all fevers remit or intermit. The exacerbations and paroxi&s;ms of fever in|vade the patient, during &s;ome part of the day, and &s;ub&s;ide in the latter part of the following night.</P>
<P>Again. The chills that precede fevers u&s;ually come on in the &s;ame part of the day, that is, between midnight and &s;unri&s;e. This is remarkably the ca&s;e with epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, as all phy&s;i|cians agree. The fact has been a&s;cribed to the debility induced by &s;leep; but I &s;u&s;pect it is owing to the debility induced by the &s;ame change in the &s;timulant powers of the atmo&s;phere, which occa&s;ions the other phenomena before mentioned.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable al&s;o that &s;leep, in the latter part of the night, is more &s;ound, than at other times; an effect perhaps of the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Lind ob&s;erves that in the Ea&s;t-Indies, patients generally expire at low water&mdash;the &s;ame fact is ob&s;ervable at the full moon&mdash;and convale&s;cents u&s;ually relap&s;e at the&s;e periods. See his Treati&s;e on the di&s;ea&s;es of hot climates. p. 86.</P>
<P>From experience I can te&s;tify that relap&s;es u&s;ually occur, at tho&s;e periods of the lunar month, when changes of weather take place.</P>
<P>Ulloa was careful to note the time of the tide when earthquakes occurred in South-America, and he found them invariably to happen at half ebb or half flood&mdash;never at high or low water.</P>

<P><PB N="302" REF="036687_0657_100AA5EABAABCA68">There are other periodical changes in the atmo&s;phere which de&s;erve notice. Great &s;torms of wind, &s;now and rain, u&s;ually begin, abate and cea&s;e at certain hours, viz. at &s;ix, nine, twelve and three o'clock; e&s;pecially at &s;ix and twelve.

<P>What is &s;till more extraordinary, we are a&s;&s;ured by unque&s;tion|able authority, that in volcanic eruptions, the di&s;charges are more violent at the&s;e hours, than during the re&s;t of the day. Sir Wil|liam Hamilton, in his excellent account of the great eruption of Ve&s;uvius, in June 1794, has the following pa&s;&s;age. "The fe|ver of the mountain, as had been remarked in former eruptions, &s;howed it&s;elf to be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, periodical, and was gen|erally mo&s;t violent, at the break of day, at noon and at mid|night."</P>
<BIBL>Univ. Magazine for Augu&s;t, 1795.</BIBL>
<P>The&s;e are the hours when we ob&s;erve great changes in the at|mo&s;phere, and &s;udden effects on the human body in di&s;ea&s;es. The break of day is preci&s;ely the time when the water-wheel is mo&s;t accelerated&mdash;when fevers remit or intermit, and when the pa|tient, lingering under di&s;ea&s;e, &s;uddenly yields, and &s;inks into his grave.</P>
<P>To what cau&s;e &s;hall the&s;e effects be a&s;cribed? Not to lunar or &s;olar attraction, in the u&s;ual &s;en&s;e of the word. Attraction is con&s;idered as a &s;teady principle operating uniformly under the &s;ame circum&s;tances; and therefore the attraction of the moon, who&s;e po&s;ition in regard to the earth is every day changed, can|not account for periodical phenomena, at certain hours in the day. The influence of the &s;un will better &s;olve the phenomena; but how can the &s;ame principle, attraction, operating by uniform laws, produce the &s;ame effects at two oppo&s;ite hours, for in&s;tance at noon and at midnight, which certainly is the ca&s;e in regard to the exacerbations of volcanic eruptions, as well as in regard to the commencement, abatement, and termination of &s;torms?</P>
<P>I do not know that any principle yet di&s;covered will &s;olve the difficulty. But the phenomena bear a greater analogy to the op|erations of electricity, than to any other principle in nature hith|erto

di&s;covered. It &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to invite to our aid repul&s;ion as well as attraction, producing in oppo&s;ite points, the &s;ame ef|fects. The nature and operations of electricity are little under|&s;tood, and probably will never be brought wholly within human comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is to be wi&s;hed that experiments on the revolutions of water-wheels, in different latitudes, may be made, with care and pre|ci&s;ion, to a&s;certain whether any acceleration at night takes place within the tropics, and if &s;o, whether it equals the acceleration, in northern latitudes. And al&s;o whether the acceleration is great|er in the latitude of 60 deg. than in the latitude of 40 deg. Our millers &s;ay that water has more force in winter, than in &s;um|mer. This may be ea&s;ily a&s;certained by experiment</P>
<P>We are enveloped in a ma&s;s of fluids, who&s;e combinations are in a continual proce&s;s of change. The energy of action &s;eems to depend on electricity&mdash;or the principle of light, heat and fire; but I am per&s;uaded that the manner in which changes are produ|ced, is very little under&s;tood.</P>
<P>I will clo&s;e this lengthy article by ob&s;erving that the phenomena of lunar and &s;olar influence are &s;o well under&s;tood and clearly proved, as to ju&s;tify in our minds, the great attention which the ancients paid to the influence of the planets on this globe. If they went into one extreme, by a&s;cribing too much to that in|fluence, the moderns have erred, on the other extreme, by holding their doctrins in contempt.</P>
<P>The &s;un is the great &s;ource of light, and his rays excite the heat which exi&s;ts in and around the globe. It moves this uni|ver&s;al principle, which con&s;titutes the energy of the material &s;y&s;tem, under the control of infinite intelligence.</P>
<P>The moon is placed in the vicinity of the earth, to give vari|ety to the &s;ea&s;ons, and by acting on the elementary principle of heat, &s;he occa&s;ions the vici&s;&s;itudes of rain, &s;now, fair, calm and tempe&s;tuous weather. The changes which precede and produce the&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes appear to be variations in the combinations of heat or electricity, with the other elemental principles of the at|mo&s;phere. The&s;e modifications of the atmo&s;phere, without any acce&s;s of new matter or diminution of its ma&s;s, produce differ|ences
<PB N="304" REF="036687_0659_100AA5EE8A19FFA0">
in its den&s;ity and ela&s;ticity, with all their various effects on the animal and vegetable &s;y&s;tems. Hence a mere modifica|tion or new combination of electricity, with vapor or other ae|rial &s;ub&s;tance, may increa&s;e or dimini&s;h its &s;timulus&mdash;during the day, it may excite fever in the human body; during the night, a &s;ubduction of excitement in the atmo&s;phere, may induce de|bility, and favor the inva&s;ion of di&s;ea&s;e and the approach of death. The&s;e are mere hints and conjectures, intended to excite inve&s;ti|gation.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;uppo&s;ed influence of comets on the ele|ments of this globe, I would remark, that on the principles here &s;ugge&s;ted, that influence is very clearly proved and may be ea&s;ily under&s;tood. The facts &s;tated demon&s;trate that the &s;un and moon exert great powers on the globe; and the fact that earthquakes mo&s;tly happen in certain po&s;itions of the moon, prove that the <HI>medium</HI> of her influence is the electric principle.</P>
<P>Now comets are known to be of various magnitudes. Some of them are as large as Venus; much larger than the moon; with highly electrified atmo&s;pheres; and &s;ometimes approaching near to the earth. The comet of 1577 came within le&s;s than a million of miles di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e comets which pa&s;s the &s;y&s;tem at an immen&s;e di&s;tance from the earth can have no great influence; but others approach|ing near, produce tremendous effects. Hence during their proximity to the earth, the number and violence of earthquakes and volcanic di&s;charges; tempe&s;ts, inundations from rains and extraordinary tides; and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible changes in the powers of animal and vegetable life. That &s;uch are the effects, is proved not only by the concurring opinions of all the ancient philo&s;ophers, who were accurate ob&s;ervers of nature, but by one uniform &s;e|ries of hi&s;torical evidence, for more than two thou&s;and years. On the principles of electricity, which is di&s;turbed, attracted, repelled and modified in its combinations with other &s;ub&s;tances, by the approach of di&s;tant bodies, the &s;olution of the phenomena is ea&s;y and philo&s;ophical.</P>

<P>SOME modern philo&s;ophers &s;uppo&s;e that the earth contains va&s;t quantities of fire, which is the &s;ource of the principal part of the heat on the earth, the cau&s;e of vegetation, of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and of hot &s;prings.</P>
<BIBL>See Buffon, and Darwin's Botanic Garden. Additional Notes, p. 145. New-York edition.</BIBL>
<P>There are &s;ome rea&s;ons to believe that particular parts of the earth abound with fire, or ma&s;&s;es of burning lava. This opinion is &s;upported by the i&s;&s;uing of &s;moke from the craters of certain volcanoes, for years in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, without any eruption of fire.</P>
<P>But the theory which a&s;cribes earthquakes to &s;team or vapor, appears to be very un&s;atisfactory. How can &s;team be collected within the bowels of the earth, &s;ufficient to &s;hake a continent of 3000 lengths in extent? If a great quantity of water &s;hould by accident fall on a ma&s;s of burning lava, the effect would not be a general equable &s;hake or concu&s;&s;ion, over a whole quarter of the globe, which &s;ometimes happens in earthquakes; but a violent &s;hake at the place of contact, and a di&s;rupture of the earth, by which the force of the &s;team would be &s;uddenly di&s;charged into the atmo&s;phere. This however is not the fact. Almo&s;t all earthquakes in North-America are progre&s;&s;ive; beginning in the interior of the country and proceeding towards the ocean, in a direction perpendicular to the line of &s;hore, that is, from north-we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t. Perhaps we can find a &s;atisfactory &s;olution of this phenomenon, upon electrical principles; but no cau&s;e can be found in the known properties and effects of &s;team.</P>
<P>One of the arguments u&s;ed to maintain the theory of &s;team, is derived from the known fact that &s;prings and &s;treams are u&s;ual|ly exhau&s;ted by extreme drouth, &s;ome time antecedent to earth|quakes and volcanic eruptions. But the fact, in&s;tead of &s;up|porting the theory, operates to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>The hypothe&s;is &s;uppo&s;es that, at certain times, the &s;prings in the vicinity of burning lava de&s;cend and fall upon it; and the
<PB N="306" REF="036687_0661_100AA5F326126DF0">
water being rai&s;ed into &s;team and extremely rarefied, expels the burning materials in volcanoes with great violence; and in earth|quakes, the force of the &s;team alone a&s;cends and &s;hakes the earth.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould the water of the &s;prings find pa&s;&s;ages to the lava, at &s;ome times and not at others? If the pa&s;&s;ages were al|ways open, the water would always de&s;cend. If they are open at particular times only, there mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;ubterraneous force exerted to open them, before the water comes in contact with the fire; the effect then or di&s;rupture, mu&s;t take place, in a certain degree, before the &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;e can operate. Con&s;e|quently the force exi&s;ts anterior to the di&s;rupture which brings the water in contact with the fire. This conclu&s;ion &s;uper&s;edes the u&s;e of vapor.</P>
<P>But by what magic does it happen that all the &s;prings and rivers in the neighborhood of a volcano for in&s;tance, di&s;appear about the &s;ame time? By what mutual con&s;ent, can this remark|able phenomenon be produced? And why, after the eruption, do all the &s;prings and rivers re&s;ume their former channels? Is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e thou&s;ands of pa&s;&s;ages, &s;cattered over many leagues of earth, to be all opened at once, to convey &s;ubterra|nean &s;prings to a particular place, a few months anterior to an eruption of fire; and after the eruption, to be all clo&s;ed at on; and the water compelled to run its former channels? Yet all this mu&s;t be admitted on the theory of &s;team.</P>
<P>That large volumes of water are &s;ometimes thrown into the ba&s;ons of volcanic mountains and ejected, it true; but, in &s;uch ca&s;es, the di&s;rupture is occa&s;ioned by a previous earthquake or force of fire, and the water is di&s;charged in ma&s;s; not in the form of vapor.</P>
<P>It is a fact authorized by all hi&s;tory and ob&s;ervation, that great earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are often, if not u&s;ual|ly, preceded by &s;evere and univer&s;al drouth. This drouth of|ten extends over whole continents; and I find that the defects of water which occa&s;ion the terrible famins in Egypt, India and China, of which we have many accounts, happen generally, (and I &s;u&s;pect always,) a few months before and during &s;ome
<PB N="307" REF="036687_0662_100AA5F4E390F330">
great di&s;charges from volcanic mountains. I have certain evi|dence that this failure of rain and &s;prings &s;ometimes occurs ten months before the eruption. This was the fact in Bengal in 1769&mdash;and in America in 1762 and 1782. At other times, the drouth happens during the eruption, and in &s;ome ca&s;es, it is continued for two or three years, in which eruptions take place in different parts of the work.</P>
<P>The drouth, on &s;uch occa&s;ioned is not occa&s;ioned &s;olely by a failure of rain, but by the concurring influence of exce&s;&s;ive evap|oration. This fact is capable of demon&s;tration. Sir William Hamilton, Univ. Mag. Aug. 1795, in his account of the erup|tion of Ve&s;uvius in 1794, informs us that &s;ome days previous to the di&s;charge, the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ountain at Torre del Greco began to decrea&s;e, &s;o that the corn-mill worked by it moved &s;lowly. In the wells of the town, the water f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll and it was nece&s;&s;ary to lengthen the ropes daily. Some wells became quite dry. In a vineyard, near the town, &s;ome per&s;ons were alarmed, eight days before the eruption, by a &s;udden puff of &s;moke and explo&s;ion from the earth.</P>
<P>It is recorded that P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tycides foretold an earthquake in Greece, from a &s;udden failure of water in a well. The&s;e facts indicate unu&s;ual evaporation.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable al&s;o that the exhau&s;tion of water extends, in &s;uch ca&s;es, to a greater depth than u&s;ual. The earth, below the u&s;ual influence of the &s;un's heat and of rains, lo&s;es its natu|ral moi&s;ture. Such probably was the ca&s;e in 1782, when the cedar &s;wamp in New-Jer&s;ey took fire and burnt to the depth of many feet. And this is probably what Livy meant, when, in &s;peaking of the terrible drouth in Rome, before the great erup|tion of Etna, B. C. 426, he u&s;es the words "ingenito humore egens"&mdash;a failure of native moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>In the vicinity of volcanoes, this evaporation may be accoun|ted for on the principle of &s;ubterranean heat, which is &s;en&s;ibly in|crea&s;ed, &s;ome time before an eruption. But this &s;olution cannot apply to countries a thou&s;and leagues di&s;tant, which &s;uffer extreme evaporation, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>There appears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> no way to account for the phenomenon
<PB N="308" REF="036687_0663_100AA5F74A739920">
but by the great principle of action, electricity. Indeed the di&s;covery of the fact, that mo&s;t earthquakes happen under par|ticular pha&s;es of the moon, and that volcanic eruptions are obvi|ou&s;ly affected by her po&s;ition in her orbit, &s;eems to place this point beyond que&s;tion.</P>
<P>It &s;eems then to be very certain that the electricity which ex|i&s;ts in and about the earth is e&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fluenced by the &s;un, moon and planets, but e&s;pecially by the larger comets; which pa&s;s near the earth. The influence of the&s;e bodies, or the e&s;&s;en|tial laws of the univer&s;e, di&s;turb this fluid and vary its di&s;tribu|tions and its combinations with other &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>Previous to earthquakes, volcanic di&s;charges and hurricanes, it is evident from many phenomena already enumerated, the elec|tricity of the earth pa&s;&s;es out of it in unu&s;ual quantities; and as the air is often a bad conductor, the fluid acce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to it and car|ries along, the water upon the &s;urface and within the bowels of the earth. This proce&s;s continued for &s;ome weeks and months, exhau&s;ts all the rivers and &s;prings. The atmo&s;phere, in the mean time, becomes more and more dry, and a wor&s;e conductor, un|til both air and earth become perfectly electric, or non-conduc|tors. In this &s;ituation, either a great demand for the fluid in &s;ome di&s;tant region, or a great accumulation of it in the bowels of the earth, has prepared the way for a &s;udden explo&s;ion, but no conducting medium exi&s;ts, &s;ufficient to convey it. A fall of rain, at this time, may create that medium; and hence the com|mon fact that earthquakes happen &s;oon after rain, &s;ucceeding &s;e|vere drouth. If no rain falls, the fluid accumulates, till it for|ces a pa&s;&s;age through the great apertures, formed for the purpo&s;e, the volcanic mountains, &s;etting fire, on its way, to the hydro|gene, and other inflammable &s;ub&s;tances, which the ocean gene|rates or depo&s;its in their bo&s;oms.</P>
<P>I know not that the&s;e conclu&s;ions are ju&s;t, but the facts from which I rea&s;on, are indi&s;putable. The uncommon di&s;charges of electricity, <HI>previous to the&s;e great concu&s;&s;ions,</HI> are indicated not on|ly by the exhau&s;tion of &s;treams and &s;prings but by many phe|nomena in the atmo&s;phere, &s;howing it to be highly electrified.

<P>The idea that the heat which we experience exi&s;ts in and about the globe, is undoubtedly well founded. The &s;un is prob|ably the great electric of the &s;y&s;tem, which excites into action the heat of the atmo&s;phere and the earth; but there is no rea&s;on to believe that heat is principally derived from that body. The &s;olar rays con&s;titute a very &s;mall part of the heat of the earth; but they excite it by the rapidity of their motions, or by decom|po&s;ing that which exi&s;ts in the air and earth.</P>
<P>Hence there appears to be little foundation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the opinion, that the inferior planets which are neare&s;t to the &s;un, have more heat, than Saturn and Jupiter. If heat is dimini&s;hed in the ratio of the &s;quares of the di&s;tances from the &s;un, it is on the principle that heat con&s;i&s;ts in &s;olar rays; but this is a very que&s;|tionable doctrin. Light is a &s;ub&s;tance, but does not nece&s;&s;arily contain heat; at lea&s;t not any that is perceptible.</P>
<P>It is probable, that if the &s;olar rays falling on Saturn are di|mini&s;hed in number, according to the doctrin of diverging lines, that this defect is &s;upplied by an increa&s;e of den&s;ity or &s;u&s;cepti|bility of excitement, in the atmo&s;phere of that planet. The den&s;ity and capacity of being excited may be in a direct propor|tion to the &s;olid contents of the planet, or in a duplicate ratio to

the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e. Hence the larger planets are placed at the greater di&s;tance, And on this principle there is no ground to calculate, as Newton has done, the extreme heat which comets acquite in their perihelion. No &s;ub&s;tance of which we have any knowlege, could &s;u&s;tain the inten&s;ity of heat which, he has calculated, the comet of 1660 mu&s;t have received. It is more con&s;onant to the general arrangement of the univer&s;e, as far as our limited under&s;tandings can comprehend it, to &s;uppo&s;e none of the great orbs that roll in infinite &s;pace, are either over heated or over cooled. Every orb has probably its own fund of heat, and the capacity of being excited, &s;uited to its place and de&s;tination. The planets, the comets in the parts of their trajectories mo&s;t remote from the &s;un, and even the &s;un it&s;elf, may be inhabited.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I take this opportunity, in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the que&s;tion concerning the origin of heat, to notice what philo&s;ophers have &s;aid on the &s;ubject of the internal heat of the earth. Darwin, in his Botanic Garden, note 6, alleges the earth below the depth of about ten feet, to be always of the &s;ame temperature, which is 48 deg. by Farenheit. He cites Dr. Franklin's ob&s;ervation, that &s;pring water at Philadelphia is of 52 de|grees, which, he &s;uppo&s;es, a proof of internal heat from central fires. For as the climate of North-America is colder, than that of England, he could not account for the exce&s;s of heat in the water at Philadel|phia, beyond that of England <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t by pre&s;uming it to be occa&s;ioned by internal fires. Yet in another pa&s;&s;age, in note 7, the author intimates that he had an idea of a difference of heat in different latitudes, deri|ved from the action of the &s;olar rays. Yet I cannot find any European author who appears to have had a correct idea of this &s;ubject; and Mr. Jeffer&s;on, in his Notes on Virginia, query 5, has manife&s;ted his ignorance of it, by a mo&s;t egregious mi&s;take. Speaking of a cave in Frederick county, he informs, that the thermometer, which &s;tood at 50 deg. in the open air, ro&s;e to 57 deg. in the cave. He then adds the following remark, "The uniform temperature of the cellars of the Ob&s;ervatory of Paris, which are 90 feet deep, and of all <HI>&s;ubterranean cavities</HI> of any depth, where no chymical agents may be &s;uppo&s;ed to produce a factitious heat, has been found to be 10 deg. of Reaumer, equal to 54&frac12; of Farenheit. The temperature of the cave above men|tioned &s;o nearly corre&s;ponds with this, that the difference may be a&s;|cribed to a difference of in&s;truments."</P>
<P>It &s;eems a little &s;trange that &s;o gro&s;s an error &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed un|corrected, till this late age, on a point of fact &s;o ea&s;y to be a&s;certained.</P>
<P>The truth is, the temperature of the earth, below the diurnal and annual influence of the &s;olar rays, which may be perhaps ten feet in &s;olid earth and 30 feet in open wells, is regulated by the proximity of place to the equator, &s;ubject to &s;mall variations, from the po&s;ition of the place in regard to the ocean and the height of the land.</P>
<P>But what is remarkable, this temperature of the earth and water in the anterior of the globe, is preci&s;ely the <HI>mean temperature</HI> of the climate, in the place where the ob&s;ervation is made. Thus, let the highe&s;t and lowe&s;t points be taken daily by any good in&s;trument, and divide the &s;um of all the ob&s;ervations by the number of days in the year, the quotient will be the mean temperature of the climate, and preci&s;ely the temperature of the water, below the variations of heat and cold. If any difference &s;hould be found, it mu&s;t be owing to inaccuracy in the ob&s;ervations. It is more u&s;ual to take three ob&s;ervations daily; at 2 o'clock P. M. the warme&s;t time in the day, at &s;un-ri&s;e the colde&s;t time, and at &s;un-&s;et, which is found to be the mean temperature. By ob&s;ervations made in the city of New-York for one year, I found the mean temperature to be 53&frac12;; but this is 1&frac12; degree too high; owing to an exce&s;s of heat <HI>within the city,</HI> beyond the general temperature of the climate. The air in a city cools le&s;s at night, than in the country, and hence the morning ob&s;ervations were found to be too high. In many in&s;tances, ice as thick as gla&s;s was formed a mile from New-York, when an accurate thermometer in the city fell no lower than 40 deg. Hence the great error of determining the temperature of a climate, by ob&s;er|vations made in a large city; which is often done in Europe.</P>
<P>The mean temperature of the climate in England, is 48 deg. That of Paris, 54&frac12;. This difference is owing to the in&s;ular &s;ituation of England; the atmo&s;phere in the vicinity of large tracts of water being always more temperate, than on continents at a di&s;tance from the &s;ea or great lakes.</P>
<P>The following is the mean temperature of the climate of the re|&s;pective places, a&s;certained by ob&s;ervations.</P>

<P>Allowing a tri&s;le for differences of in&s;truments, this table pre&s;ents to view the various mean temperatures of the climates mentioned.</P>
<P>From this table naturally ari&s;e two ob&s;ervations. Fir&s;t the great dif|ference between the climate in Europe and America, under the &s;ame parallels of latitude. Thus London in 51 degrees north, has a mean temperature, almo&s;t as mild as Hartford in 41, Paris in the 49th de|gree has a climate, nearly as mild as the northern parts of Virginia in the 39th, and warmer than New-York and Philadelphia in the 40th.</P>
<P>Again we ob&s;erve the great effect of the ocean upon the climate. Salem in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts is upon the &s;ea &s;hore, and Rutland, in Ver|mont, fifty or &s;ixty leagues di&s;tant; and one degree of latitude differ|ence in the po&s;ition of the places; yet the climate at Rutland it 3&frac12; degrees colder than at Salem. On the other hand, Quebec, remote from the &s;ea, tho on a river, with three degrees difference of northern latitude, has a difference of only 1&frac12; degree in climate.</P>
<P>To a&s;certain the mean temperature of any given place, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to plunge a good thermometer into water, taken from a depth, in which the temperature it uniform, at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year.</P>
<P>The mean temperature of water within the tropics it not exactly known, but it mu&s;t be very near 80 deg. by Farenheit. Water drawn from a depth of 200 feet in the We&s;t-Indies, it <HI>cooled</HI> by filtration in the air, above the earth in tho&s;e hot regions.</P>
<P>The difference in the temperature of Europe and America under the &s;ame parallels, is nearly that of ten degrees of latitude.</P>

<P>But whatever rarefaction may be &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;till it will remain an incontrovertible principle in phy&s;ics, that no &s;ub&s;tance that has <HI>gravity</HI> can be &s;upported, but in a medium which has <HI>more gravity.</HI> The vapor &s;uppo&s;ed in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e could not be maintained in &s;trait lines, without a medium of greater den&s;ity to &s;upport it. Now, any medium capable of &s;upporting vapor mu&s;t furni&s;h great re&s;i&s;tance, and very much retard its velocity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;ubmit it to mathematicians whether on Newton's own principles, an atmo&s;phere of den&s;ity &s;ufficient to &s;upport a cannon ball, would not retard its ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, as much as the pre&s;ent atmo&s;phere does a feather put in motion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> rarefaction does not in the lea&s;t aid the a&s;cent of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from the body of a comet.</NOTE></P>
<P>With the&s;e known principles in view, let any man calculate the velocity of vapor, driven from the nucleus of a comit, ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve a direction nearly oppo&s;ite to the &s;un, in its perihelion pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Comets enter the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem in various directions; the planes of their orbits making various angles with that of the ecliptic. Their orbits are nearly elliptical, and the &s;un is in one of the foci of the ellip&s;is.</P>
<P>By the univer&s;al law of planetary motion, according to which all revolving bodies de&s;cribe equal areas in equal times, the mo|tion
<PB N="313" REF="036687_0668_100AA60267E38C40">
of comets mu&s;t be very rapid in their perihelion. The comet of 1770 was calculated to de&s;cribe an arch of 50 degrees in 24 hours. This &s;eems hardly credible; but many comets de&s;cribe an arch of 180 degrees, a &s;emi-circle, in 30, 40, or 50 days.</P>
<P>The perihelion di&s;tances al&s;o of the various comets are very different, and &s;o are the lengths of their tails; &s;ome of them extending a &s;mall di&s;tance, and others to 60 and 80 millions of miles.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the perihelion di&s;tance to be 30 millions of miles, and the length of the coma to be 70 millions. In this ca&s;e the ex|tremity of the tail mu&s;t be 100 millions of miles from the &s;un. Now, either the vapor which is &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;titute the tail, mu&s;t be &s;hot from the nucleus with &s;uch rapidity, as to reach the extreme point of the coma, in a few hours; that is, it mu&s;t pa&s;s through 70 millions of miles, in a very &s;hort time, to pre|&s;erve a direction nearly oppo&s;ite to the &s;un; or the whole coma mu&s;t move forward with the nucleus. In the latter ca&s;e, the extremity of the coma mu&s;t pa&s;s along the periphery of a circle,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The figure would not be a circle, but it is not material to the ar|gument.</NOTE> who&s;e radius is a line from that point to the &s;un, or 100 millions of miles. Of cour&s;e while the comet de&s;cribes an arch equal to a &s;emi-circle, the extremity of the coma mu&s;t pa&s;s through the &s;pace of 150 millions of miles. I believe no kind of vapor of which we have any knowlege, could perform either of the&s;e journeys in the time given.</P>
<P>On the other hand that gravitating &s;ub&s;tance would not have pa&s;&s;ed thro the di&s;tance &s;uppo&s;ed, from the creation of the world to this time.</P>
<P>On &s;ubjects of this kind, we cannot arrive at certainty. All we can do is, to rea&s;on from analogy and from probable conjec|tures. We know of no &s;ub&s;tance in creation, capable of pro|ducing the phenomena of the comas of blazing &s;tars, except electricity or light. No other &s;pecies of matter pa&s;&s;es with a rapidity that will &s;olve the phenomenon of the length of the coma pre&s;erved in a direction oppo&s;ite to the &s;un. The theories of Kepler and Hamilton are more rational, than that of New|ton.
<PB N="314" REF="036687_0669_100AA605BA32AE80">
The tails mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of electricity repelled from the nu|cleus by the force of the &s;un; or mu&s;t be merely the rays of light colored by their pa&s;&s;age thro the comet's atmo&s;phere. The&s;e hypothe&s;es may not &s;olve <HI>all</HI> the phenomena; but they will account for the principal; and are repugnant to no philo|&s;ophical principles.</P>
<P>The curvature of the coma has been alleged as an objection to this hypothe&s;is. But in fact this is a confirmatory argument in favor of it; for it is analagous to the curvatures formed by a&s;|cending &s;treams of electricity in the lumen boreale; indeed it &s;eems to be a law of electricity to move in bending lines; and for any thing we know, this phenomenon may re&s;ult from the nature of that &s;pecies of matter, and be independent of re&s;i&s;t|ance.</P>
<P>In regard to the tran&s;parency of the tail, it re&s;embles al&s;o the lumen boreale. Thro both of the&s;e luminous appearances, the &s;tars &s;hine with undimini&s;hed lu&s;tre; but vapor, however rare, would refract their light, and in a certain degree, interrupt our vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>An E&s;&s;ay on Comets by Andrew Oliver, publi&s;hed 1772, a&s;|cribes the tails of comets to air extremely dilated and repelled from the nucleus by the power of the &s;un; but this hypothe&s;is is liable to all the objections &s;tated again&s;t the theory of Newton.</P>
<P>My own opinion re&s;pecting the material &s;y&s;tem, is this; that an atmo&s;phere, the ba&s;is of which is electricity, fills infinite &s;pace and involves in its bo&s;om all the &s;olid orbs which &s;hine in the ce|le&s;tial regions. This may be denominated the <HI>mundane atmo&s;|phere.</HI> My hypothe&s;is re&s;ts on the following rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The large meteors or globes of fire are formed in re|gions far beyond the limit a&s;&s;igned to the earth's atmo&s;phere. Their altitudes vary from 40 to 80 miles. At the height of 80 miles, then, there mu&s;t be the matter of an atmo&s;phere, capa|ble, of generating globes of fire of half a mile in diameter; and of communicating &s;ounds, as full and di&s;tinct, as the air near the earth; for the explo&s;ion of one of tho&s;e globes re&s;embles thunder.</P>
<P>Secondly. The lumen boreale has been often calculated to be vi&s;ible at an elevation of 7 or 800 miles. I do not rely on
<PB N="315" REF="036687_0670_100AA6074BCAC4B0">
the accuracy of the&s;e calculations, on account of the difficulties attending them. In &s;ome in&s;tances we are very certain that this light exi&s;ts in the regions of the higher clouds.</P>
<P>Thirdly. The tails of comets mu&s;t be matter, or depend on matter for their coloring by which they become vi&s;ible. In ei|ther ca&s;e we have evidences nearly amounting to demon&s;tration that a material atmo&s;phere fills the boundle&s;s regions of &s;pace.</P>
<P>Fourthly. But an argument of &s;till more weight in my mind, is one drawn from the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch an atmo&s;phere, as the me|dium of attraction and repul&s;ion&mdash;the principles that connect and bind together the va&s;t orbs that roll in etherial regions. I can have no idea of &s;uch an immen&s;e power exerted in an immen&s;e void or vacuum.</P>
<P>It &s;eems probable that the parts of our atmo&s;phere which con|&s;titute weight, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to influence the barometer, are limited to the di&s;tance of a few miles from the earth. Water, for in&s;tance, is a &s;ub&s;tance de&s;tined to an&s;wer certain purpo&s;es on the globe, and is probably confined to its neighborhood.</P>
<P>But the principle of electricity may be, and undoubtedly is, a nongravitating and permanently ela&s;tic &s;ub&s;tance. This may be diffu&s;ed through infinite &s;pace, and by its amazing ela&s;ticity, may be capable of communicating motion or force from planet to plan|et, with the rapidity of light.</P>
<P>Newton &s;uppo&s;ed infinite &s;pace to be filled with a &s;ubtle &s;ub|&s;tance which he called <HI>ether.</HI> Had this great man been acquainted with the laws of electricity di&s;covered &s;ince his days, he probably would have exchanged the term ether, for <HI>electricity.</HI></P>
<P>By means of this powerful principle, the planets all influence each other; and become the means of diver&s;ifying each other's &s;ea&s;ons; &s;ometimes by attracting, &s;ometimes by repelling, and &s;ometimes di&s;turbing the proportions of this &s;ub&s;tance, or influen|cing its mechanical laws, by which it is combined or decompo|&s;ed with other atmo&s;pheric &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>Hence we may account for the frequency of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and violent tempe&s;ts, under particular pha&s;es of the moon, and e&s;pecially during the proximity of comets. The electrical matter accumulated in the earth by its own laws, or by rea&s;on of an unu&s;ual demand a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> extra may, during the ap|proach
<PB N="316" REF="036687_0671_100AA609B7BF7430">
of the&s;e orbs, be &s;uddenly called into action, and occa|&s;ion extraordinary tumults in the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Perhaps al&s;o we may, in this hypothe&s;is, find a &s;olution of the phenomenon, &s;o intere&s;ting to man, and &s;o my&s;terious, why the approach of comets never fails to be attended with epidemic di&s;|ea&s;es. The fact in regard to comets which come near the earth, it unque&s;tionable; and it is equally certain that earth|quakes, volcanic eruptions, meteors and many other electrical phenomena, are, at &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> more numerous and violent, than at other times.</P>
<P>Now it is proved by experiments that the fibres of living ani|mals are the mo&s;t perfect conductors of electricity, while the in|teguments which cover them are non-conductors. A con&s;equence of the&s;e principles mu&s;t be, that in all the motions or operations of electricity in the atmo&s;phere, the nerves mu&s;t be the principal &s;ubjects of its influence. Hence if the atmo&s;phere is, at times, electrified beyond the degree which is u&s;ual, and nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the body in a due &s;tate of excitement, the nerves mu&s;t be too highly excited, and under a continued operation of undue &s;timulus, become extremely irritable, and &s;ubject to debility. Shall we not find, in this hypothe&s;is, a rational &s;olution of the phenomenon which has puzzled medical men, the exce&s;&s;ive irri|tability of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, in times of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, which facilitates the inva&s;ion of fever? Shall we not account for the eruptive di&s;ea&s;es which always precede pe&s;tilential epidem|ics, on the principle of the great debility of the extreme ve&s;&s;els, induced by the weakne&s;s of the nerves which &s;pread over the human body near the &s;urface, by which means the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are rendered incapable of performing their u&s;ual &s;ecretions? Shall we not be able to account for the remarkable coincidences in time between the influenza, and unu&s;ual electrical phenomena, as volcanic eruptions and earthquake? May we not account for epidemic mea&s;les, in tho&s;e years when the atmo&s;phere &s;hows ev|idences of high electrification? And will not this principle ex|plain the di&s;ea&s;es among animals, the defect of vegetation, and the extraordinary generation of in&s;ects, during pe&s;tilence? It is well known that vegetation may be greatly accelerated by artifi|cial electricity. Is this effect produced by what is called <HI>ex|citement</HI>?
<PB N="317" REF="036687_0672_100AA60C916D97F8">
And if &s;o, how do we know that a &s;imilar power, operating on the elements, may not call into exi&s;tence innumeri|ble in&s;ects? To what other principle &s;hall we a&s;cribe the <HI>unu&s;ual &s;ize</HI> of common in&s;ects, when they precede and accompany pe&s;|tilence, a fact well atte&s;ted?

In con|firmation of this theory, my enquiries into the cau&s;e of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es have led to a di&s;covery, that tho&s;e years when volcanoes di&s;charge great quantities of fire and lava, including &s;ome months before and after the di&s;charges, are by a great difference, mo&s;t productive of hail. Hence the immen&s;e damage done by hail-&s;torms in tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons which are exce&s;&s;ively dry and hot; the&s;e years being clo&s;ely attendant on volcanic eruptions. The theory which a&s;cribes hail to extreme cold is defective. We know that pieces of ice of three, &s;ix and even nine inches in circumference &s;ometimes fall in hail-storms. By the laws of gravity, a hail-&s;tone mu&s;t begin to fall, as &s;oon as it begins to be formed; and as it requires but a few &s;econds to de&s;cend, it is ea&s;y to conceive that mere cold cannot occa&s;ion a congelation rapid enough to form pieces of ice of half a pound weight. The proce&s;s is elec|trical, and almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous; and we know that real &s;now may be artificially and in&s;tantly produced by means of conden&s;ed air and electricity. Hence we are led to the cau&s;es which con|nect &s;evere winters with volcanic eruptions; we derive the ex|treme heat of &s;ummers and cold of winters, which &s;o generally accompany pe&s;tilence, from the &s;ame cau&s;e, a &s;uper abundance of electricity.</P>
<P>Hence we are led al&s;o to the cau&s;e of the apoplexies, lethar|gies and eruptive di&s;ea&s;es, which almo&s;t uniformly follow great volcanic di&s;charges and earthquakes in Italy. The &s;y&s;tem, and e&s;|pecially the nerves, are exce&s;&s;ively excited, and lo&s;e their energy.</P>
<P>It is on the &s;ame principle al&s;o that we explain the phenomena of freezings when the thermometer is above the u&s;ual point of fro&s;t. This has been ob&s;erved near volcanic mountains, where the atmo&s;phere is highly charged with electricity. In 1730,

<P>The nature of this element, electricity, is little under&s;tood. It is the modern opinion that heat and light are only modifica|tions of the &s;ame element. This is analogous to what we know of water, which exi&s;ts in the form of water, of vi&s;ible vapor and air.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed that electricity cannot be in&s;ulated in the human body. But if it cannot be in&s;olated in the form of <HI>electricity,</HI> may it not in the form of <HI>heat,</HI> and thus be the direct cau&s;e or matter of inflammation? If it can be accumulated and in&s;ulated in this form, may not conductors be formed to draw it off in the form of electricity? Mr. Vinal relates that he &s;peedily re|moved local inflammation occa&s;ioned by a burn and &s;cald, by the application of a negatively charged electrical machine.</P>

<P>Should this doctrin be well founded, the &s;ucce&s;s of metallic points in removing topical inflammation, will be explained and e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The proofs of the altitude of the atmo&s;phere from the power of refracting light, are now known to be fallacious. No man will &s;uppo&s;e the atmo&s;phere to be le&s;s elevated, in the equatorial regions, than in the polar circles; yet the duration of twilight, under the equator, being le&s;s than in places remote from it, proves that the power of refraction will not determin the height of the atmo&s;phere. The power of refraction is in a ratio to the diminu|tion of heat, or increa&s;e of cold, in the atmo&s;phere; or perhaps to the increa&s;e of electricity.</P>
<P>Nor will it be correct to &s;ay that the power of refraction de|pends on the den&s;ity of the atmo&s;phere, unle&s;s den&s;ity can exi&s;t independent of gravity. The atmo&s;phere in the polar and tem|perate regions rai&s;es the barometer no higher, than under the equator; nor is the mercury in barometers generally higher in winter, when the thermometer, by Farenheit's &s;cale, is 20 de|grees under cypher, than in &s;ummer when it is at 98 deg. the temperature of blood heat.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="036687_0674_100AA6104E8D47E0">If den&s;ity implies or involves in it gravity, then the atmo&s;phere at the equator is as den&s;e as in any di&s;tant latitude, for the bar|ometer is as high in one as in the other. But if the atmo&s;phere it as den&s;e and as heavy, caeteris paribus, in one latitude, as in another, then the powers of refraction, in different latitudes, which are various, cannot depend on den&s;ity.</P>
<P>It is indeed very que&s;tionable whether den&s;ity and gravity are the principles which wholly influence the barometer. The bar|ometer falls, as it is elevated above the &s;urface of the earth; but the atmo&s;phere retains all its powers of &s;u&s;taining re&s;piration and circulation, at an altitude of 15,000 feet.</P>
<P>What are the aerial phenomena that attend a fall of the bar|ometer? How can the weight of the ma&s;s of air &s;urrounding the globe, be &s;uddenly taken off, over a whole continent? What be|comes of its gravity, and the principle of attraction on which it is &s;uppo&s;ed to depend? Are they removed, expelled, or &s;u&s;|pended?</P>
<P>I &s;u&s;pect the theory which a&s;&s;igns to the barometer the province of determining the gravity of air, is fundamentally defective; and that in&s;tead of variations in its <HI>weight,</HI> it indicates only va|riations in the combinations of its parts, which diver&s;ify its <HI>ela&s;ti|city,</HI> and its operation on the barometer, as well as on the human body. When the atmo&s;phere is full of vapor, the barometer u&s;ually falls, and we feel a depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits. It can handly be true, that the pre&s;&s;ure of the whole atmo&s;phere is le&s;s, at &s;uch a time, than when the air is clear and the barometer high; for this vapor circulates near the earth and the higher regions of the air are as clear and as ponderous as u&s;ual. If the den&s;ity of the air near the earth &s;hould be le&s;&s;ened, the con&s;equence mu&s;t be the air from higher regions which retains its gravity, mu&s;t in&s;tantly ru&s;h in to &s;upply the defect.</P>
<P>The only way to account for the variations of the barometer, appears to be on the principle before mentioned. The air appears to be le&s;s ela&s;tic, when the heat is combined with vapor, and the mercury falls. It &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to take into view the&s;e con&s;id|erations in order to &s;olve the phenomena. The general pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere or gravity, is probably uniform, and it is
<PB N="320" REF="036687_0675_100AA611E04AD498">
the various changes in its ela&s;tic powers, which occa&s;ion the vibrations in the barometer.</P>
<P>Every dairy woman knows that thunder and lightning will al|mo&s;t in&s;tantly coagulate milk; that is, when electricity is united with vapor, and pa&s;&s;es, in a vi&s;ible form, from cloud to cloud, or between the clouds and the earth, <HI>milk turns,</HI> or coagulates&mdash; &s;o it does, during a rainy day, in &s;ummer, without thunder, with the thermometer at 64 deg. as I know by ob&s;ervation. This condition of the atmo&s;phere, may be called its <HI>decompo&s;ed</HI> &s;tate. The barometer falls, vapor becomes vi&s;ible, the functions of the body are languid, milk coagulates, objects contract mould, in &s;hort the atmo&s;phere is unela&s;tic, and ill-fitted to maintain vigor in animal or vegetable bodies.</P>
<P>Thus al&s;o the fermentation of beer is checked and de&s;troyed by thunder, and no human art has been found to re&s;tore it. By what proce&s;s of electricity is this &s;udden change effected?</P>
<P>I have remarked in the preceding pages, that a pe&s;tilential at|mo&s;phere is not corrected or moved by the force of wind&mdash;no tem|pe&s;t expelling an epidemic fever from a city, unle&s;s at the clo&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on, and accompanied with heavy rains. How can we &s;olve this difficulty, but upon the hypothe&s;is of an electrical atmo&s;phere which it &s;tationary?</P>
<P>Dr. Franklin proved that "an electrified cork ball at the end of a &s;ilk thread, whirled never &s;o rapidly through the air, for a length of time, lo&s;t none of its electricity. He found al&s;o by an experiment that an electrical atmo&s;phere rai&s;ed round a thick wire, in&s;erted in a phial of air, drives out none of the air; nor on withdrawing that atmo&s;phere, would any air ru&s;h in." On Electricity, Lond. ed. 97. It is al&s;o proved that a mo&s;t violent bla&s;t of wind, thrown acro&s;s a &s;tream of electrical matter, has not the lea&s;t effect upon it.</P>
<P>The&s;e experiments prove that air furni&s;hes no &s;en&s;ible re&s;i&s;tance to the motion of electricity, and that it exi&s;ts in air without ex|panding or compre&s;&s;ing it. In &s;hort it proves that electricity acts entirely by its own laws, and is not controlled by the agita|tions of the air.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="036687_0676_100AA61578FF1468">Will not the&s;e ob&s;ervations throw light on the fact of a &s;ta|tionary atmo&s;phere in ca&s;es of pe&s;tilential epidemics? Is not electricity the ba&s;is of the common atmo&s;phere, and immoveable by wind? And does not a pe&s;tilential air con&s;i&s;t partly in &s;ome combinations of this element, with other aerial &s;ub&s;tances, which are not moved by wind? This is &s;ugge&s;ted merely for con|&s;ideration; for it appears to me improbable. Fro&s;t de&s;troys the pe&s;tilential condition of the atmo&s;phere, and this is &s;uppo&s;ed to act upon the deleterious &s;ub&s;tances ari&s;ing from the earth, or hu|man body. Be&s;ides, a pe&s;tilential atmo&s;phere ri&s;es but a few feet above the earth, which indicates that its pernicious qualities are den&s;e and gravitating &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>Indeed two cau&s;es &s;eem to concur in the origin of pe&s;tilential fevers&mdash;an electrical condition of the atmo&s;phere which renders the nervous &s;y&s;tem extremely irritable, and the body of cour&s;e prone to fever; and a collection of morbid matters ari&s;ing from living<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I mention the morbid matters from <HI>living</HI> bodies, among the cau&s;es of pe&s;tilence. I am per&s;uaded that per&s;piration in cities furni&s;hes more poi&s;on than &s;treets and alleys. It fills all clo&s;e rooms, e&s;pecially bed rooms; in clo&s;e-built &s;treets, it infects the very atmo&s;phere; and a more virulent poi&s;on does not exi&s;t, than per&s;pirable matter in a con|den&s;ed and fermenting &s;tate.

Wind may remove the latter cau&s;e, if acce&s;&s;ible, which however is never the ca&s;e in large cities; but cannot affect the influence of the former. Fro&s;t has acce&s;s to all morbid cau&s;es, and renders them inert. It al&s;o reduces the &s;timulus acting on the human body, and renders it le&s;s irritable. But the electrical &s;timulus remains. Hence altho the progre&s;s of the fever is arre&s;ted by cold, the type of it is vi&s;ible in the di&s;ea&s;es of the winter. The irritability of the &s;y&s;tem, from electrical cau&s;es, &s;till re|mains; and gives to the fevers of winter the peculiar &s;ymptoms of pe&s;tilential or typhus pleuri&s;y, and peripneumony.</P>
<P>A remarkable property of electricity is to give polarity to the needle of a compa&s;s. A violent &s;troke of electricity, de&s;troyed the virtue of the load&s;tone, and rever&s;ed the ends of the needle of the compa&s;s on board of Capt. Waddell's &s;hip in 1751; and a &s;uitable di&s;charge of that element will give polarity, like the
<PB N="322" REF="036687_0677_100AA61A51EF6A58">
magnet. Hence it is concluded that magneti&s;m depends on electricity, but in what manner, &s;eems to be my&s;terious.</P>
<P>It is well known that the needle is &s;ubject to variations, which are different in different parts of the earth; and in &s;ome degree, periodical. It has al&s;o a &s;mall diurnal variation; receding from the ea&s;t or <HI>influence of the &s;un</HI> from 8 o'clock in the morning to 2 in the afternoon; and from the we&s;t, or the &s;ame influence, from 2 o'clock to 9 P. M.; and during the night, remaining &s;tationary. Is not this owing to the repul&s;ion of light and heat? If &s;o, is there not an analogy between this diurnal variation, and the phenomenon of polarity? If light and heat, falling on one &s;ide of the needle, repel it in a &s;mall degree; is it not ra|tional to conclude that the equatorial heat, &s;hould repel the mag|netic point, and direct it to the north? That is, the needle points towards that portion of the atmo&s;phere which is mo&s;t per|fectly electric.</P>
<P>It may be objected that the needle does not always direct it|&s;elf to the &s;ame point. True; but there is &s;ome periodical revo|lution in the electricity of the terre&s;trial regions; as the appear|ance and di&s;appearance of the lumen boreale, at certain periods, warrants this &s;ugge&s;tion. It &s;eems to be admitted that there is a current of electricity from the equatorial regions towards the polar regions, within the earth, and in the upper parts of the atmo&s;phere, a current of the &s;ame element from the poles to|wards the equator. This idea is derived in part from the lumen boreale, and receives countenance from the fact, that a bar of iron, &s;tanding directed towards the pole will acquire polarity or magnetic properties; but directed towards other points in the heavens, no &s;uch effect is produced; indicating a &s;tream of e|lectricity pa&s;&s;ing through the bar, from the center of the earth towards the pole, but not in any other direction.</P>
<P>Should this idea be well founded, and &s;hould it be admitted that the lumen boreale is a current of electricity from the north to the &s;outh, will not the periodical appearance and di&s;ppearance of this light, indicate a revolution in that current about the axis of the earth, or perhaps an axis of its own? If &s;o, on what laws does it depend, and how will it agree with the variations of the compa&s;s?</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="036687_0678_100AA6183954C5E8">It will be &s;aid, that the variations are different in different places, and not uniform in the &s;ame place. True; but the gen|eral cour&s;e of variations in the &s;ame place is tolerably uniform.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to different degrees of variations in various pla|ces, I have one ob&s;ervation that is probably new. It is very probable, if not evident, that the <HI>di&s;tributions</HI> or <HI>forces</HI> of elec|tricity are different in different quarters of the globe. I &s;ay <HI>di&s;tributions</HI> or <HI>forces;</HI> for a difference in the &s;tate of exi&s;tence or modes of acting, will as well account for the phenomena, as difference in quantity. My rea&s;ons for this opinion are, that the barometer has different altitudes, in different places, at the &s;ame time. The mean altitude for a month or a year, in places of the &s;ame elevation, is very various. Hence we conclude that the weight of the atmo&s;phere cannot be the cau&s;e of the&s;e varia|tions, for this on a level of the ocean, mu&s;t, on hydro&s;tatic prin|ciples, be every where the &s;ame. Yet the actual differences a|mount to one half or two thirds of an inch.</P>

<P>It is ea&s;y to account for this difference of pre&s;&s;ure on the prin|ciple of different combinations of the electric principle with vapor or other local matter in the atmo&s;phere, which may vary the <HI>force</HI> or ela&s;ticity of the air; but I do not &s;ee how the <HI>weight</HI> of a fluid alone, who&s;e pre&s;&s;ure mu&s;t be equal, if of equal height and den|&s;ity, can account for the&s;e differences. It is utterly repugnant to all known principles of the equable pre&s;&s;ure of a gravitating fluid, to &s;uppo&s;e a mere change in the form or compo&s;ition of that fluid, &s;hould alter the ab&s;olute weight. Water admits none of the&s;e varieties, being always of equal den&s;ity and gravity at equal altitudes.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame principle of a difference of pre&s;&s;ure or ela&s;ticity in air and water, without a change of weight, perhaps we may account for the very different elevations of the tide in different places, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, in the &s;ame latitude. It is rational to conclude that the electricity is various in its combinations or quantity, in different places, according to the heat of the climate, the neighborhood of land and high mountains, or perhaps to the &s;eats of volcanoes? The fact that tides do not ri&s;e as high, on the main ocean, as near land, &s;eems to countenance this idea.

It &s;eems to indicate that the medium by which the moon influ|ences the water, has different powers near the land and at a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Another fact that &s;eems to favor the hypothe&s;is that electricity is the in&s;trument of tides, is, the great irregularity of tides. In many in&s;tances there have been preternatural ebbings and flowings of the tide&mdash;&s;ometimes the river Thames, for in&s;tance, has been left almo&s;t dry, for many hours, when there has been neither wind nor earthquake to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unt for the phenomenon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A rece&s;s of this kind is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tioned in 1114, when the Thames for the whole day, on the 15th of October, was &s;o low, that children wa|ded over between the Tower and London bridge. In 1247 there was a ce&s;&s;ation of the flowing of the tides for three months, before a &s;evere earthquake. See Short vol. 2. 145. I &s;hould not be inclined to credit the&s;e relations if modern ob&s;ervations did not &s;erve to confirm them. On the 11th of March 1785 and 25th of January 1787, the Tiviat, a large river in the &s;outh of Scotland, receded and left its channel dry, in the former in&s;tance, <HI>two hours,</HI> and in the latter, <HI>four.</HI> No convul&s;ion of the earth was known in that neighborhood, nor within two or three weeks of the fir&s;t in&s;tance.

A &s;imilar rece&s;s happened on the day of the earthquake, in the river Clyde. On the 12th of September 1784, in perfectly calm weather, the water in the Lock Tay in Scotland &s;uddenly ebbed 300 feet and left the channel dry, then flowed again, and thus alternately ro&s;e and fell for two hours. The &s;ame phenomenon, in a le&s;s degree, occur|red in &s;everal &s;ucceeding days.</P>
<BIBL>Sinclair, vol 6. 624.</BIBL>
<P>The facts related of the &s;ea and rivers in Holland on the day, but not at the hour, of the earthquake, at Li&s;bon, in 1755, when &s;hips &s;napped their cables, and water da&s;hed over the &s;ides of ve&s;&s;els, without the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible motion of the earth, are &s;trong proofs of the &s;ame in&s;en&s;i|ble but immen&s;ely powerful action of the electricity of the globe. The &s;welling of the ocean in the time of earthquakes is not &s;o much owing to the ri&s;ing of the earth beneath, as to the force of electricity. The intume&s;cence &s;ometimes begins <HI>before</HI> the &s;hock, as it does <HI>before</HI> hurri|canes in the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>In Scotland, during the great earthquakes in Calabria, in 1782, the water in the locks was agitated without any motion of the earth, and the mercury in the barometer fell within the tenth of an inch of the bottom of the &s;cale. On the 12th of February 1787, the barometer at Edinburgh fell nearly to the &s;ame point.</P>
<P>The&s;e phenomena can be re&s;olved into no cau&s;e but &s;ome operation of electricity, and they add much weight to my &s;u&s;picions, that tides are governed by &s;ome laws of electricity, which are influenced by the pha&s;es of the moon.</P>
<P>The great fall of the barometer in Scotland is a &s;trong evidence that the &s;ame energetic principle governs that in&s;trument. It is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e the atmo&s;phere could have lo&s;t &s;uch a portion of its weight. Indeed it is far from being impo&s;&s;ible that the ri&s;e and fall of the ba|rometer may be occa&s;ioned by the force of electricity acting on the qick&s;ilver it&s;elf.</P>
<P>If any per&s;on &s;hould he&s;itate to believe that a mere change in the combination of electricity and aerial &s;ub&s;tances, may vary the &s;pring or ela&s;ticity, without the lea&s;t alteration of their weight, let him attend to the different powers of wine, cyder or beer, before and after fer|mentation begins. It is not pre&s;umable that the liquor has more weight in a &s;tate of fermentation, than when quie&s;cent, before that proce&s;s begins; yet the force with which it acts upon the ca&s;k con|taining it, is increa&s;ed perhaps a hundred fold. I &s;u&s;pect that the changes in the atmo&s;phere which affect the barometer and the human body are analogous to what we ob&s;erve in liquors&mdash;mere alterations in the combinations of the parts, producing various ela&s;tic powers, with|out any change in the general gravity of the atmo&s;phere. Hence it is ea&s;y to conceive that the ela&s;tic power of the atmo&s;phere may be di|ver&s;ified by &s;ub&s;tances exhaled from the earth, in different &s;ituations; this may occa&s;ion &s;mall variations of the barometer in two di&s;tant places, having the &s;ame altitude, and be one cau&s;e of differences in the &s;alubrity of the air.</P>
<P>This idea it &s;till better illu&s;trated by the different properties of gun|powder in the kernel and in a &s;tate of explo&s;ion. In the former &s;tate, an immen&s;e ela&s;tic power is confined to a compa&s;s inconceivably &s;mall &mdash;by adding to it a &s;park of fire, this ela&s;tic power is &s;et loo&s;e with tre|mendous effects.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>It appears to me probable that the medium by which impre&s;|&s;ions are conveyed from one object to another, is that mo&s;t ela&s;|tic fluid, the principle of fire or electricity, which pervades eve|ry object and is diffu&s;ed through creation. A motion given to this fluid in the brain is in&s;tantly conveyed, by its ela&s;tic prop|erty, to the remote&s;t fibre, and vice ver&s;a. The &s;ame fluid, diffu&s;ed through the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, and all creation, may and probably is the medium by which di&s;tant orbs make impre&s;&s;ions on each other.</P>
<P>It is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that the bodies that compo&s;e the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, or any other &s;y&s;tem of worlds, can be &s;u&s;pended in an immen&s;e void, and revolve about a common center, at di&s;tances of many millions of miles, without &s;ome medium of connection; &s;ome tie to bind them together. It is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that an influence can be exerted between them, unle&s;s thro the medium of a &s;ub&s;tance. This &s;ub&s;tance is doubtle&s;s that &s;ubtle, ela&s;tic fluid which con&s;titutes the ba&s;is of fire, heat, light, or electricity. This fluid, receiving an impre&s;&s;ion from one globe, in any part of &s;pace, may impart it to another, in a few moments, by means of its ela&s;tic powers. This theory accords with the known prop|erties of electricity; and affords a &s;ublime idea of the magnifi|cent &s;tructure of the univer&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>On the popular modes of guarding again&s;t infection.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND have, in all ages, re&s;orted to a variety of expedients to guard them&s;elves from pe&s;tilential di&s;tempers, and to check them when exi&s;ting. The u&s;e of aromatics as a <HI>pe&s;ti|fuge,</HI> is as old as the journey of the I&s;raelites from Egypt; for when the plague had broke out among them, Aaron took his cen&s;er, put on <HI>incen&s;e,</HI> and &s;tanding between the dead and living, the plague was &s;tayed.</P>
<BIBL>Numb. xvi. 47.</BIBL>
<P>Herodian relates that in time of pe&s;tilence, the Romans &s;tuf|fed their no&s;trils with aromatics, but without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Mignot relates that the Turks, at this day, make great u&s;e of aromatics, to guard them&s;elves from the plague.</P>
<BIBL>Hi&s;t. Turk. Emp. vol. 2.</BIBL>
<P>Diemerbroeck chewed tobacco as a pre&s;ervative, and alleges many in&s;tances of its good effects. It is not improbable that this article, by promoting di&s;charges of the &s;aliva, may prevent the
<PB N="328" REF="036687_0683_100AA6248A44FB88">
noxious matter from entering the &s;y&s;tem by the &s;auces, which are principal agents in ab&s;orbing the poi&s;on. Any other herb that will promote &s;pitting, would probably be equally &s;alutary. Wa&s;hing the mouth frequently with fre&s;h water is very u&s;eful in the &s;ame way; and nur&s;es &s;hould never inhale the effluvia of the &s;ick, without immediately wa&s;hing the mouth.</P>
<P>In our country, many &s;imilar expedients are employed toward off infection. Camphor is worn in little bags around the neck, or frequently applied to the no&s;e.</P>
<P>It does not appear that aromatics and pungent &s;alts have much effect in re&s;i&s;ting the attacks of pe&s;tilence. There is probably no attraction between the particles of &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances and the poi&s;on of the plague. Stimulants are u&s;eful, in &s;ome ca&s;es, when applied to the whole body; but applied to the no&s;e, their effect is local, and wholly inadequate to the purpo&s;e. A &s;poonful of fre&s;h water, taken frequently into the mouth, and di&s;charged, is better than a pound of camphor; for water mingles the infectious particles with its ma&s;s, and renders it harmle&s;s or carries it off.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible however that, in &s;ome ca&s;es, an atmo&s;phere im|pregnated with the &s;timulating effluvia of &s;piceries may pre&s;erve the body from the attacks of this di&s;ea&s;e. An in&s;tance is related in Acta Eruditorum of the year 1721, publi&s;hed at Leip&s;ic, that per&s;ons living near &s;torehou&s;es of &s;pices e&s;caped the plague. We &s;hould however be cautious of drawing conclu&s;ions from a &s;ingle fact. The effect may have proceeded from an un&s;u&s;pected cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Skenkius, from Alex. Benedictus, informs, that it is a cu&s;|tom among the Tartars in the Crimea, to kill their dogs in time of pe&s;tilence and &s;uffer them to putrefy on the earth; alleging that the fetor arre&s;ts the plague by changing the air. Page 773. This is certainly a mo&s;t &s;ingular remedy, and the fact requires good authority and explanation to induce belief. It however corre&s;ponds with &s;ome in&s;tances, in which pe&s;tilence has been lea&s;t &s;evere in filthy places.</P>
<P>The burning of powder is held to be u&s;eful in checking the plague, by generating re&s;pirable air. Lernnius, lib. 2. The blowing up of a magazine has been &s;aid to put a &s;top to pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>During the civil wars in England, which ended in the death of Charles I. Fuller relates that the plague in Litchfield was
<PB N="329" REF="036687_0684_100AA626617EDC10">
arre&s;ted by the firing of cannon, at the &s;iege of that town. The pious author &s;ays that many a&s;cribed this to the <HI>purging of the air by the bullets,</HI> but divines a&s;cribed it to God's good providence.</P>
<P>It is related in Van Swieten that the fermentation of wines on the Mo&s;elle, in time of vintage, had a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible effect in checking the plague.</P>
<P>It has been cu&s;tomary to burn re&s;inous &s;ub&s;tances in the &s;treets to &s;top the progre&s;s of pe&s;tilence, but without any &s;en&s;ible ef|fect. It was attempted in Philadelphia in 1793 and in New-York in 1795, but the ill &s;ucce&s;s has prevented a repetition of the attempt.</P>
<P>Authors relate that the ancient phy&s;icians put a &s;top to the plague, by enkindling large fires in the &s;treets. I con&s;ider the fact as doubtful, for it is not agreed among writers, whether this was done by Hippocrates, or another man.</P>
<P>It was however on the &s;trength of the &s;tory, that great fires were kindled in London in 1665; but the deaths were more nu|merous on that night, than they had been before. If fire can be of any u&s;e in the plague, it mu&s;t be by creating motion in a &s;tag|nant air, or by drying a moi&s;t one. The latter effect is that which Galen &s;uppo&s;ed to have re&s;ulted from the fires u&s;ed by the ancients; and there may be &s;ituations and times, when a fire in infected hou&s;es may be applied to good purpo&s;e, by removing damp &s;tagnated air. But it is que&s;tionable whether the atmo&s;|phere of a city can be &s;en&s;ibly and beneficially changed by public fires; and the experiment is very hazardous, for if the fire &s;hould be communicated to the buildings, it would not only con|&s;ume property, but double the rage of pe&s;tilence. Thus the plague in Con&s;tantinople in 1539 was greatly inflamed by a fire which con&s;umed a large part of the city. Fatigue and di&s;tre&s;s, added to the previous cau&s;es, multiplied the new ca&s;es, and one third of the inhabitants peri&s;hed.</P>
<BIBL>Mignot's Hi&s;t. Turk. Emp. vol. 2.</BIBL>
<P>Every thing which collects, fatigues and alarms people, at &s;uch times, is very prejudicial; as the fire in Philadelphia, in 1793; in Providence, in 1797, and the launching of the frigate in Baltimore, in the epidemic of the latter year.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="036687_0685_100AA62AA4C0D810">The only effectual &s;afety is in flight.

<HEAD>On Vene&s;ection.</HEAD>
<P>THE exten&s;ive mortality occa&s;ioned by the plague, the ra|pidity of the di&s;ea&s;e, and the virulence of its poi&s;on, which often defies all medical aid, have called forth all the exertions of talents and knowlege, to invent &s;ome mode of defeating its ravages.</P>
<P>It is agreed on all hands, that per&s;piration, if induced on the fir&s;t &s;eizure of the patient, is the mo&s;t effectual pre&s;cription. Hence the univer&s;al u&s;e of alexipharmics in pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>But it often happens, that no application whatever will excite per&s;piration, and e&s;pecially, in the later &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>No part of the practice of medicin has excited &s;uch warm controver&s;ies, as vene&s;ection. It is foreign from my plan to di&s;|cu&s;s this que&s;tion; my remarks are intended rather to explain the cau&s;e of this diver&s;ity of opinions, from my ob&s;ervations on hi&s;torical facts.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the medical writers who were per&s;onally acquainted with the true plague, in former ages, when it frequently over|&s;pread Europe, have decided again&s;t bleeding.</P>
<P>In the plague which ravaged all France in 1565, Charles IX. then king, demanded of all the phy&s;icians to give information of the be&s;t mode of treatment, and they unanimou&s;ly decided again&s;t the practice of bleeding liberally.</P>

<P><PB N="331" REF="036687_0686_100AA62C2C029230">Ambro&s;ius Paraeus, in the &s;ame plague, made exten&s;ive en|quiry, as to the &s;ucce&s;s of bleeding and purging, the an&s;wer of his medical friends was, that in all ca&s;es, the&s;e evacuations, if powerful, were fatal.</P>
<BIBL>Sennertus, p. 356.</BIBL>
<P>Fore&s;tus, ob&s;erved, in the plague of 1557, at Delph, that tho&s;e all died, who were bled after twelve hours from the inva|&s;ion of the di&s;ea&s;e.

Sarracenus, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cribing a plague in Ge|neva.</P>
<P>Fallopius remarked in the plague which raged from 1524 to 1530, that all died who were bled. This was ob&s;erved al&s;o by H. Florentus, a phy&s;ician of Leyden&mdash;by Simonius, in the plague of 1602&mdash;Hildanus, in the plague at Lau&s;anne, and a multitude of others. See them collected in Diemerbroeck, de pe&s;te, 130. and &s;equel, who found in the plague at Nimeguen "vene&s;ection|em damno&s;i&s;&s;imam fui&s;&s;e"&mdash;bleeding was extremely injurious.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we have in the &s;ame author a long li&s;t of names of eminent phy&s;icians, who warmly advocate vene&s;ection. To this li&s;t may be added the name of the celebrated Sydenham.</P>
<P>The &s;ource of this difference of opinion is doubtle&s;s the dif|ference of the &s;ymptoms in the di&s;ea&s;e under different con&s;titu|tions of air, in different places, and in different habits. The great difference in the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, under different epidemic con|&s;titutions, was mo&s;t di&s;tinctly ob&s;erved by Sydenham; and this variety &s;eems to con&s;titute no &s;mall nor ea&s;y part of the phy&s;ician's inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>Sydenham ob&s;erved what is undoubtedly true, that the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e is characterized with different &s;ymptoms, under different conditions of the air; and often the &s;ame apparent &s;tate of air produces very different di&s;ea&s;es. It is very evident, that the <HI>vi|&s;ible</HI> qualities of the &s;ea&s;ons are not the <HI>only</HI> circum&s;tances that modify di&s;ea&s;es. The learned Boyle remarks the great diver&s;ity in plagues, requiring remedies altogether different.</P>
<BIBL>Vol. 5. p. 60.</BIBL>
<P>Hence at one time, the plague, in a few hours after inva&s;ion, induces a &s;tate of debility, in which bleeding will, in almo&s;t eve|ry ca&s;e, accelerate death. At other times, the di&s;ea&s;e may main|tain,

for two or three days, a highly inflammatory diathe&s;is, in which a timely, and judicious u&s;e of the lancet may prevent a fa|tal termination.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded that hi&s;tory will ju&s;tify the&s;e remarks, and make practitioners very cautious of pre&s;cribing for the name of a di&s;|ea&s;e. This caution is more e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary on the fir&s;t ap|pearance of an epidemic before the ruling type of the di&s;ea&s;e is fully manife&s;ted.

<HEAD>On Vapor or Mephitic Air, extricated from the earth by means of di&s;charges of the electrical fluid.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE &s;ugge&s;ted in the preceding pages, that epidemic di&s;ea&s;es may be &s;ometimes occa&s;ioned by a vapor extricated from the earth. That &s;uch has been the fact in ca&s;es of earthquakes, has been proved by &s;everal examples; that a deleterious vapor may be expelled from the earth and produce di&s;ea&s;es, without a concu&s;&s;ion, appears from the ca&s;e at Rouen in 1753, and the &s;ickne&s;s and death of fi&s;h are &s;trong evidences of the truth of the principle. Other con&s;iderations lead to the &s;ame re&s;ult.</P>
<P>In the account which Sir W. Hamilton has given of the eruption of Ve&s;uvius in 1794, Univ. Mag. Oct. 1795, it is ob|&s;erved, that "after every eruption of that volcano we read of damage done by mephitic air, which coming from under the an|cient lava, in&s;inuates it&s;elf into low places, as cellars and wells near the foot of the mountain." Several in&s;tances happened af|ter the eruption of 1767, of per&s;ons going into cellars and being &s;truck down with this vapor, who would have died, without a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.
<PB N="333" REF="036687_0688_100AA6307280AE30">
This vapor on an open plain &s;ub&s;ides near the earth, being heavier than common air; but it fills cellars, wells and hollow places, &s;o as to endanger life, and actually proves fatal to birds, bea&s;ts, and vegetables; &s;ometimes to men. This vapor or fixed air is generated by the action of vitriolic acid on calca|reous earth; and by other means in the immen&s;e laboratory of Nature's works.</P>
<P>The facts here &s;tated and which are well known to every chymi&s;t, will perhaps account for the <HI>damps</HI> in wells, as this fixed air is called in popular language. It is a common idea that air will become impregnated with this vapor, by mere &s;tag|nation in a well. This is probably a mi&s;take. Nor is it proba|ble that any &s;ub&s;tances in the well generate this air. It cannot proceed from water, nor from the earth, or &s;tones, or rocks which compo&s;e the &s;ides of the well, unle&s;s the earth is different from common earth. It is probable therefore that this mephitic vapor is expelled from the earth by force of internal heat or elec|trical fire; and that this happens not uniformly, or at any certain times. I &s;u&s;pect that the di&s;charge of it happens at particular times in various parts of the earth, from cau&s;es not yet explain|ed; and that it occa&s;ions epidemic di&s;ea&s;es among men, bea&s;ts and fi&s;hes. To aid us in an enquiry of this kind, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to examin a great number of facts, and di&s;cover whether this mephitic vapor is ever found in wells, except when epidemic di&s;ea&s;es of &s;ome &s;ort or other prevail among animals.</P>
<P>On the 30th of Augu&s;t 1795, ju&s;t after the pe&s;tilential fever appeared in New-York, two men fell victims to this vapor, in a well belonging to a brewery in Pine-&s;treet, within a few yards of the hou&s;e where I then re&s;ided. The well had been dug but a few months, and was not u&s;ed, but covered over with boards. It was about 25 or 30 feet deep, contained a few feet of water, and was &s;o full of mephitic vapor, that a candle was extingui&s;hed within eight feet of the &s;urface of the earth, as I found by ex|periment. This was during the &s;ickne&s;s, and a que&s;tion ari&s;es whether the two things were connected in cau&s;e. Had not a &s;imilar vapor been &s;ilently thrown from the bowels of the earth, over all the coa&s;t and region from New-Jer&s;ey to Connecticut,
<PB N="334" REF="036687_0689_100AA63325032C88">
for &s;ome months previous? And may not the &s;ickne&s;s of the oy&s;ters and &s;had on that coa&s;t, from 1794 to 1796, as well as the de&s;tructive epidemic angina, fevers and dy&s;entery, be a&s;crib|ed to that cau&s;e? I offer this hint to excite enquiry. Gov. El|lis, in a paper on the &s;ubject of hurricanes, Mu&s;eum, vol. 9. 215, mentions, among the precur&s;ors of tho&s;e tempe&s;ts, thick vapors in the air "&s;en&s;ibly mephitic." If this vapor is the cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;es, it will account for the greater prevalence of them in low &s;ituations.</P>
<P>There is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that this mephitic air is expelled from the earth, in con&s;iderable quantities, at particular times, but incorporating it&s;elf with the common air, it does not often prove fatal to men, altho it may le&s;&s;en the vital powers of the atmo&s;phere, and aid in the production of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>In 1729, on the 19th of July, a Mr. Adams of Bo&s;ton and his &s;ervant peri&s;hed by this air in a well. Let it be ob&s;erved that in this year, the influenza &s;pread over Europe. Whether it was in America or not, I cannot learn; but the mea&s;les was epidemic in Bo&s;ton, in that year; and other parts of America were &s;ickly.</P>
<P>But what among other things inclines me to the opinion that this &s;pecies of air is not generated gradually in wells, but is ex|pelled from the earth &s;uddenly, is a fact related in the &s;ame pa|per with the foregoing, Baddam's Mem. vol. 9. 4. Phil. Tran&s;. 411; that on the 9th of May preceding this accident, two men at work in a well in School-&s;treet, Bo&s;ton, were &s;uddenly at|tacked by this &s;pecies of vapor, and came near lo&s;ing their lives. The well had recently been dug and enlarged, the workmen ex|periencing no inconvenience; and that the vapor did not proceed from opening a new cha&s;m, or breaking a new &s;tratum of earth or minerals, is certain; for the men were not the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> digging, but &s;toning the &s;ides of the well.</P>
<P>In Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, No. 119, it is &s;aid that damps are generally ob&s;erved to come about the end of May, and to continue during the heat of &s;ummer. At that &s;ea&s;on al&s;o they are mo&s;t violent in mines infe&s;ted with them, during the whole year. But by a &s;ub&s;equent paragraph, it appears that the writer
<PB N="335" REF="036687_0690_100AA634CC45C4F8">
in that remark made no di&s;tinction between fixed air and inflam|mable.</P>
<P>If it is true that this vapor is expelled from the earth in &s;pring and &s;ummer only or principally, to what cau&s;e &s;hall we a&s;cribe that circum&s;tance? Not to internal heat certainly, for that at the depth of 20 feet is always the &s;ame. We may perhaps find a &s;olution in the excited atmo&s;phere of &s;ummer, which may oc|ca&s;ion di&s;charges of electricity.</P>
<P>It might be well for the world, if experiments were made to a&s;certain the&s;e points. If a vapor is at times thrown into the at|mo&s;phere from the internal parts of the earth, and becomes nox|ious to health, it is of great con&s;equence to the world to know the fact, as this air &s;ub&s;ides into the lower grounds, and might often be avoided. A deep covered well and not u&s;ed, might be kept for this purpo&s;e, and a lighted candle or lamp let down to its bottom once a month. If there had been a di&s;charge of me|phitic air, it would be found in the well; but if the air of the well &s;hould be found good, we might conclude that the atmo&s;|phere had received no taint from &s;ubterranean vapor.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject de&s;erves inve&s;tigation. The herbage is at times affected by a dew or clammy &s;ub&s;tance, which is vi&s;ible, tangible and offen&s;ive to cattle. In&s;tances have been related in the pre|ceding hi&s;tory. The honey-dew is a curious phenomenon, not well under&s;tood. This is a &s;ub&s;tance that re&s;embles honey or wax, depo&s;ited on the leaves of trees, and attaching it&s;elf to blades of corn. It is &s;weet to the ta&s;te, and the honey-bee is &s;een to feed upon it. To corn it is very prejudicial, by cau&s;ing a bla&s;t.</P>
<P>I have not been able to a&s;certain whether this is a periodical or an accidental phenomenon, nor to find the cau&s;es of it in the known properties of air or water. Is it the produce of a vapor from the earth; or of &s;ome unu&s;ual combination of aerial &s;ub|&s;tances?</P>
<P>We live in a fluid, compo&s;ed of various ingredients, each of which has its own properties, and by various combinations, and ince&s;&s;ant changes, the&s;e ingredients are daily generating new prop|erties. One day, the &s;ky is calm and cloudle&s;s; the next, the

<HEAD>On the revolution of certain Comets.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE this work has been in the pre&s;s, I have had the curio&s;ity to trace back the revolutions of two or three comets, who&s;e periods were calculated by Dr. Halley, to find how far his a&s;tronomical calculations are verified by the hi&s;tory of the ap|pearance of comets, in former ages. The following are the re|&s;ults.</P>
<P>The comet of 1682 Dr. Halley found to have a period of 75 years. If this calculation is exact, the &s;ame comet mu&s;t have appeared in the following years. The fir&s;t column contains the years when the comet mu&s;t have appeared, &s;uppo&s;ing its period to be exactly 75 years&mdash;the &s;econd, contains the years when a comet appeared, according to the preceding hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>If the&s;e calculations and facts may be relied on, this comet mu&s;t have appeared in the year 256, in the mid&s;t of the mortal pe&s;tilence, in the reign of Gallus and Volu&s;ian, and in the year 31 or 32, a little before the crucifixion of our Savior.</P>
<P>The calculations re&s;pecting the return of the comet of 1661 coincide remarkably with hi&s;torical facts. Its period is &s;uppo&s;ed to be 129 years.

<P>I have no account of a comet in 887; but in page 112 of Vol. I. a &s;evere plague and hard winter are mentioned, under that year. The events related in page 77, under the years 242 and 3, are &s;uch as lead me to &s;u&s;pect a comet, at that period, which corre&s;ponds with the calculations; but I have no account of any. The &s;ame remarks may be made re&s;pecting the events of the years 114 to 117, when Antioch was de&s;troyed, as re|lated page 70.</P>
<P>Of the events before Chri&s;t 16, I have no particular account. The three preceding periods of this comet, before Chri&s;t 145, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">74, and 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">3, corre&s;pond with great pe&s;tilence.

and 43&mdash;48&mdash;56 of Vol. I. And this might have been the &s;tar alluded to by Ju&s;tin, in the pa&s;&s;age quoted in page 43.</P>
<P>But we have an in&s;uperable difficulty to the&s;e calculations&mdash;this &s;tar, if its period is 129 years, &s;hould have appeared in 1789 or 90; but no comet was &s;een. One appeared in the autumn of 1788, but I know not whether the elements of its trajectory corre&s;ponded with tho&s;e of the &s;tar of 1661. Calculations of this kind are yet too uncertian to be the ba&s;is of a &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>It is greatly to be de&s;ired that the revolutions of the comets could be reduced to as much certainty, as tho&s;e of the planets. Such calculations would enable as to account for many of the vi|olent changes on this globe; and aid us to fix the era of certain great phenomena of antiquity: For no fact is better e&s;tabli&s;hed, than that comets have a prodigious influence on the electricity of the earth and its atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>The comet of 1680 is &s;uppo&s;ed to have a period of 575; and the appearance of a &s;plendid &s;tar of this kind in 1105 and 531, gives rea&s;on to believe the calculation ju&s;t. If &s;o, it mu&s;t have appeared before Chri&s;t 44&mdash;619&mdash;1194&mdash;1769 and 2344. The latter year falls within 8 years of the period a&s;&s;igned to the del|uge. But the uncertainty of ancient chronology leaves room to que&s;tion all re&s;ults from the&s;e calculations.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of my inve&s;tigations into the origin of the bilious plague, I have had &s;o many opportunities to detect the error<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pro|ceeding from <HI>common report,</HI> that I am led to que&s;tion every fact that does not come directly from the per&s;ons concerned in the tran&s;action related. I had &s;uch confidence, for in&s;tance, in the facts publi&s;hed and believed by the people in New-Haven, re|&s;pecting the origin of the fever of 1794, in that city, from im|ported &s;ources, that I had prepared an account of it for the pre&s;s, before I called on the per&s;ons be&s;t able to give me correct information. On examination, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find mo&s;t of the &s;uppo&s;ed facts totally unfounded: and Mr. Gorham and Capt. Truman, the per&s;ons concerned, when informed of the reports which had been circulated on the &s;ubject, expre&s;&s;ed their &s;urpri&s;e that people &s;hould have propagated &s;uch tales, without calling on them for a true &s;tate of facts.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid and publi&s;hed that Polly Gorham, the <HI>&s;econd</HI> per|&s;on &s;eized with the fever, was pre&s;ent in Mr. Au&s;tin's &s;tore when the che&s;t of clothes was opened. The gentleman who publi&s;hed this report, has &s;ince informed me that he had no authority for it, but the &s;tory of a child of &s;ix or &s;even years old. But Capt. Truman who opened the che&s;t him&s;elf informs me, that Polly Gorham was <HI>not</HI> in the &s;tore at the time.</P>
<P>It was reported and is &s;till believed, by mo&s;t of the people in the town, that I&s;aac Gorham's wife wa&s;hed infected clothes; but Mr. Gorham a&s;&s;ures me that there is not the lea&s;t foundation for the &s;tory, and he is a&s;toni&s;hed that &s;uch a tale could have been circulated. He cannot a&s;&s;ign any good cau&s;e for the fever in his family, and is inclined to the opinion that no infection was received from the &s;loop.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible and probable that &s;ome per&s;ons who came in the
<PB N="341" REF="036687_0696_100AA644968749C8">
&s;loop had been into Gorham's hou&s;e; at lea&s;t into the &s;hop in the front room. And this is the only po&s;&s;ible way to account for the propagation of infection from that &s;loop, even admitting that it contained infected clothing. But even in this ca&s;e, it would &s;eem &s;trange that Gorham him&s;elf &s;hould e&s;cape, and his wife and niece who were u&s;ually in the back room, &s;hould con|tract di&s;ea&s;e. But the following facts which have been re|ceived from Capt. Truman, &s;ince the fir&s;t volume was printed, will &s;how the improbability, if not the impo&s;&s;ibility, of &s;uch a communication of infection.</P>
<P>This &s;loop, called the Iris, arrived from Martinico at New-York in May. All her men and pa&s;&s;engers were and had been, during the pa&s;&s;age, in good health. The &s;loop of cour&s;e was permitted to enter as a clean ve&s;&s;el, and &s;he was hauled up to a wharf, where &s;he lay ten or twelve days wind-bound, before &s;he could proceed to New-Haven. She had no cargo on board, except a few &s;alted hides, which were taken out and put on board of a coa&s;ter, commanded by Capt. Miles to be tran&s;ported to New-Haven. This was done without the lea&s;t injury to any per&s;on concerned in removing the hides. At this time happened a long &s;eries of ea&s;terly winds and rainy weather, &s;ucceeding the memorable fro&s;t after the 17th of May 1794. In the&s;e rains the ve&s;&s;el was wa&s;hed ince&s;&s;antly day after day, and &s;he was vi&s;ited by many per&s;ons who had bu&s;ine&s;s on board; and as it happens with all ve&s;&s;els that lie at a wharf in &s;uch a place, hundreds, if not thou&s;ands mu&s;t have been on board, while &s;he lay at New-York. Now it happens that not a &s;oul among all that were on board, from the time of her leaving Martinico, till &s;he arrived at New-Haven, was affected with fever. How the &s;loop or the hands, after having intercour&s;e with &s;o many per&s;ons, came to re&s;erve their infection for New-Haven, I &s;ubmit to be determined by wi&s;er heads than mine. The facts are here &s;tated from the in|formation of the per&s;ons concerned&mdash;tho&s;e which have been be|fore publi&s;hed, are mingled and confounded with popular rumors which can be traced to no genuin &s;ources.</P>
<P>Let it be noted that when the two fir&s;t per&s;ons were &s;eized, no per&s;on &s;u&s;pected the di&s;ea&s;e to be the yellow fever. Mrs.
<PB N="342" REF="036687_0697_100AA6472E37B210">
Gorham probably died without ever knowing her di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;at lea&s;t her phy&s;ician did not &s;u&s;pect it, till &s;he vomited black matter, the evening before her death. Hence it happened that no enquiry into the origin of the fever, took place till &s;everal days after|wards, and not till after the death of Mr. Au&s;tin and his clerk. This is one rea&s;on why it became difficult to obtain a true &s;tate of facts&mdash;a difficulty that was greatly increa&s;ed by the alarm and con&s;equent perturbation of the public mind.</P>
<P>And after all the que&s;tion of dome&s;tic or foreign origin is much better decided by the character and phenomena of the epidemic, than by any human te&s;timony relating to things not vi&s;ible. The ca&s;e of a bilious fever, attended with black vomit, men|tioned in page 306 of Vol. I. occurred in the la&s;t week in March, near the wharf and in the center of the ground, afterwards the &s;eat of the fever. It was le&s;s malignant than in autumn, but from the de&s;cription of it given me by the woman's mother and the attending clergyman [the phy&s;ician being dead] I mu&s;t con|clude the di&s;ea&s;e to have been of the &s;ame &s;pecies, and indica|ting a di&s;po&s;ition in the atmo&s;phere of the place to give to fever that particular character.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The phy&s;ician, Dr. Hubbard, after the fever appeared in &s;ummer, mentioned to the Rev. Mr. Hubbard, that it was of the &s;ame &s;pecies with that which occurred in March. This ca&s;e was nine or ten weeks before the arrival of the Iris.</NOTE> The &s;carlatina was then the current epidemic. In May this declined, and gradually di&s;appeared, in June and July, as the yellow fever advanced. To a philo&s;ophic mind, the&s;e facts amount to evidence of dome&s;tic origin, that far out-weighs the uncertain and contradictory evidence of the importation of a &s;ub&s;tance which is neither vi&s;ible nor tangible.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the origin of the fever at Hartford, I have this further evidence. The &s;loop mentioned in page 347, had never been in the lea&s;t infected with any di&s;ea&s;e whatever, before &s;he arrived at Hartford. Her former Captain died in May of a lingering com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; He went to New-York after he was unwell and growing wor&s;e, he returned and died at home. Captain Tucker then took the command, went to New-York and took on board a cargo of &s;alt. From thence he &s;ailed to New-Ha|ven, where he lay five or &s;ix days, at the wharf, endeavoring to
<PB N="343" REF="036687_0698_100AA648B75B5B30">
fell the &s;alt. While there, people indi&s;criminately were on board, and among them &s;everal gentlemen of my acquaintance who give me this information. This was about the middle of July, and as it was ju&s;t after the Neptune arrived from China, the wharf was unu&s;ually crouded with people, who were pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;|&s;ing between the wharf and that &s;hip. Here then the &s;loop did no mi&s;chief. She went to Hartford and di&s;charged her &s;alt. I have unequivocal evidence that not a per&s;on concerned in un|loading her, was affected with fever, and that &s;everal of the per|&s;ons fir&s;t &s;eized in Hartford, had not been near her. After &s;he left Hartford the captain and mate were &s;eized, and the former died [not both as &s;tated in page 347.]</P>
<P>Another ve&s;&s;el, I find, has by &s;ome been &s;u&s;pected of introdu|cing the fever into Hartford. This al&s;o was a coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;el, which took in a pa&s;&s;enger at New-York, who &s;ickened, after he came on board, and the ma&s;ter landed him at New-Haven. If I am rightly informed, this ve&s;&s;el did not arrive at Hartford, un|til after the fir&s;t ca&s;es of fever occurred; but of this I am not certain. Certain it is, that no per&s;on on board, except the pa&s;&s;en|ger landed at New-Haven, was ever ill, and therefore the ca&s;e de&s;erves no con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>It ought further to be &s;tated that two or three weeks before the alarm at Hartford, and before the arrival of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, a ca&s;e of fever occured of the malignant kind, and in all e&s;&s;ential points, with the character of the yellow fever. I have lately learnt that a &s;imilar fact occurred in Bo&s;ton in 1798. The&s;e ca&s;es are not u&s;ually numbered with tho&s;e of yellow fever&mdash;but the truth is, and &s;uch will it appear to be, when &s;cience, philo&s;ophy and candor &s;hall triumph over prejudice and popular tales, that the&s;e milder ca&s;es of fever, bearing the character in a degree, of the &s;ub&s;equent epidemic, are the precur&s;ors of the di&s;ea&s;e to fol|low&mdash;they are the effect of the atmo&s;pheric principle on partic|ular &s;u&s;ceptible con&s;titutions, before the proper &s;ea&s;on for the full force of the principle to operate&mdash;they are irre&s;i&s;tible evidence that the di&s;ea&s;es which they precede, are u&s;ually, if not always, generated in the place where they exi&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="036687_0699_100AA64CE55F8528">SINCE the fir&s;t volume was printed, I have obtained from attending phy&s;icians, an account of the fever at Middle-Haddam, in the town of Chatham, on Connecticut river in 1796. [This is mentioned in page 331 to have been in 1797, but it was in 1796.]</P>
<P>This fever was traced in every in&s;tance to a ve&s;&s;el from a port in Hi&s;paniola, which was highly infected. No per&s;on was af|fected, without direct intercour&s;e with the ve&s;&s;el, the clothing or the &s;ick. About 30 per&s;ons were affected, eight of whom died. When carried to a di&s;tance, the fever did not &s;pread.</P>
<P>That this was a di&s;ea&s;e contracted from imported infection is evident from this circum&s;tance&mdash;that in every ca&s;e it could be traced to intercour&s;e with the &s;ick or infected articles&mdash;it was not taken by pa&s;&s;ing along the &s;treet nor from hou&s;e to hou&s;e. A|nother fact is equally demon&s;trative of this origin; which is, that it commenced late in September and had no precur&s;ors. When it ari&s;es from the atmo&s;phere of the place, it always be|gins as early as Augu&s;t or earlier&mdash;and this is probably true of every autumnal complaint in our latitude.</P>
<P>The fever in that place therefore was what I call a <HI>di&s;ea&s;e of mere infection,</HI> in contradi&s;tinction from yellow fever originating in the country, which begins uniformly in the hot months, is taken without intercour&s;e with the &s;ick or with infected articles, has its precur&s;ors and ab&s;orbs all other di&s;ea&s;es or gives them all its predominant type. The di&s;tinction is &s;o obvious that it is not ea&s;y to mi&s;take it.</P>
<P>Of the di&s;ea&s;es from imported &s;ource this is one&mdash;two or three other in&s;tances in the United States have been mentioned. But mo&s;t of the in&s;tances of this fever in America, &s;ince 1790, have had the unequivocal characters of epidemics&mdash;&s;uch charac|ters as never attend, and as cannot po&s;&s;ibly attend, di&s;ea&s;es of mere infection.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ummer pa&s;t, the wild pigeons in the we&s;tern parts of New-York &s;tate and in Penn&s;ylvania, have been affected with a di&s;|ea&s;e of which many have died. It is under&s;tood that the head or neck was &s;welled; but I have no correct account of the di&s;temper.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="036687_0700_100AA64B39D18F38">FROM the report of a ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el, it appears that fi&s;h of various kinds peri&s;hed in September or October la&s;t, on the Carolina coa&s;t from Cape Look-out to Cape Fear, a di&s;tance of 70 miles. Some were &s;een dead and others dying, as far as the eye could reach. The yellow fever has al&s;o prevailed in &s;ome parts of both Carolinas. Does not the death of fi&s;h afford rea&s;on to believe that the electrical fluid or mephitic air, is occa|&s;ionally di&s;charged from the earth in unu&s;ual abundance? And may not local di&s;ea&s;es be a&s;cribed to that cau&s;e?</P>
<P>IN addition to what I have &s;aid in the 16th &s;ection, rela|tive to predi&s;po&s;ition to a particular di&s;ea&s;e, I would ob&s;erve, that we ought to make a di&s;tinction between a <HI>natural aptitude to a di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> and an <HI>adventitious liability</HI> to it, from artificial cau&s;es. The latter is what u&s;ually pa&s;&s;es under the name of <HI>predi&s;po&s;ition:</HI> And this may lead to error. When per&s;ons &s;ay, a man will not take a fever by infection unle&s;s he is predi&s;po&s;ed, they u&s;ually mean that he has, by accidental cau&s;es, <HI>prepared</HI> his body to be affected. Hence we continually hear the doctrin that infection will not operate in a healthy atmo&s;phere; but in order to give it force and effect, the atmo&s;phere mu&s;t be <HI>prepared;</HI> that is, mu&s;t &s;uffer a change favorable to a di&s;ea&s;e, but not &s;ufficient to pro|duce it.</P>
<P>I apprehend this doctrin is erroneous. The fact, as a gene|ral one, is the rever&s;e; and the longer a body remains in health in an infected atmo&s;phere, the le&s;s liable is it to the di&s;ea&s;e. So true is this, that pri&s;oners in jails &s;uffer no injury from the air, which will de&s;troy the lives of men who enter it, from fre&s;h air. This fact is well known. It is equally true, in our cities, du|ring pe&s;tilence, that per&s;ons from fre&s;h air, are much more liable to be &s;eized, on entering the infected atmo&s;phere, than tho&s;e who have lived in it. Hence in every ca&s;e of mere infection, per&s;ons are <HI>mo&s;t expo&s;ed</HI> to it, who are <HI>lea&s;t prepared</HI> or <HI>predi&s;po&s;ed</HI> by breathing an infected air.</P>
<P>But not &s;uch is the fact with regard to the influence of atmo&s;|pheric

cau&s;es on particular bodies. In this ca&s;e, the cau&s;e &s;ingles out and &s;eizes the per&s;ons, who have a particular aptitude or habit of body, in a manner altogether unaccountable. Sometimes this power is evidently in operation a long time, before it pro|duces di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Perhaps this natural aptitude of a body to receive or re&s;i&s;t di&s;ea&s;e, may be illu&s;trated by the following fact, which is under every man's ob&s;ervation. Let two apples or pears, be taken from a tree at the &s;ame time&mdash;let them be apparently alike in &s;oundne&s;s and in every particular on which their pre&s;ervation may be &s;uppo&s;ed to depend. Lay them by the &s;ide of each other&mdash;equally expo&s;ed to heat and moi&s;ture. In this ca&s;e, one may and often will peri&s;h many weeks before the other. This aptitude to peri&s;h is natural, and doubtle&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the interior organization of the fruit; but this is utterly invi&s;ible, even with the be&s;t micro&s;cope.</P>
<P>This idea &s;eems to be important towards accounting for the operation of a pe&s;tilential atmo&s;phere on various bodies, and is confirmed by the facts related of pe&s;tilence that has &s;eized par|ticular families or tribes of men, while others, equally expo&s;ed, have e&s;caped. This may be called natural predi&s;po&s;ition or ap|titude to a di&s;ea&s;e, in di&s;tinction from that &s;tate of the body which is the effect of artificial or accidental cau&s;es, and which may be the commencement of the di&s;ea&s;e, according to Brown's definition.</P>
<P>SINCE the fir&s;t volume was put to pre&s;s, I have collected from various authors, accounts of &s;everal plagues in Egypt, which I had not then found. As I have &s;ugge&s;ted that pe&s;ti|lence is u&s;ually marked by catarrh, it may be proper to lay to|gether further evidence of the fact. Egypt and Con&s;tantinople are the places where autumnal fevers are mo&s;t apt to take the form of pe&s;tilence. Catarrh, in tho&s;e cities, &s;eems clo&s;ely to attend the plague. Witne&s;s the following examples.</P>

<P>There are &s;ome long periods in which I have no account of the di&s;ea&s;es. The plague of 1705 in Egypt is the only one of which I have an account, that I cannot trace to a connection with uni|ver&s;al catarrh; and I have no account of a plague in Egypt after the influenza of 1709. I a&s;cribe this however to the imperfec|tion of my accounts. How greatly to be regretted is the want of accurate and complete regi&s;ters of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es!</P>
<P>Let this detail of authentic facts, be compared with what eve|ry man may recollect in America. How the pre&s;ent &s;eries of plagues was introduced by a double portion of catarrh! for the influenza of 1789 was followed in 1790 by another influenza&mdash; the only in&s;tance I can find on record of two of the&s;e epidemics within the &s;hort &s;pace of &s;ix or eight months! Let it be recollec|ted al&s;o that catarrh was prevalent in the &s;pring of 1791, 1793 and 1798, and that in our large cities, pe&s;tilence has in every in&s;tance, been introduced or followed [or both] by influenza, which has &s;ome|times been local, that is, very much limited to the place where the pe&s;tilence had prevailed or was to prevail. Who then can deny that catarrh and plague are connected in cau&s;e? It is not po&s;|&s;ible to deny it&mdash;the evidence is conclu&s;ive&mdash;and when this &s;ub|ject &s;hall be fully inve&s;tigated, it will appear that pe&s;tilence, whether plague or yellow fever, is produced by the &s;ame general change in the properties of the air, which produces influenza&mdash;the tran|&s;it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">

from the one epidemic to the other being cau&s;ed by the &s;ea|&s;ons, or other unknown cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I learn from a communication of the Briti&s;h Con&s;ul at Alex|andria, that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alculated a mill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on of people had peri&s;hed by the plague in Upper and Lower Egypt between 1795 and 1796; and our accounts from that country, mention that the di&s;ea&s;e had not cea&s;es, the la&s;t &s;pring; that is, it returned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the proper &s;ea&s;on. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eems therefore that pe&s;tilence in Africa runs cotem|poraneous with pe&s;tilence in America.</P>
<P>I have recently learnt from Irwin's Travels, that there was no plague in Egypt from 1770 to 1777, and from other writers I collect that it was not there for two or three years after. This is a remarkable fact, as Egypt is &s;eldom exempt longer than five years in one period. Now it will be remarked that in the &s;ame period, and for &s;ome time before and after, no epidemic infec|tious yellow fever occurred in America, nor as far as I can learn, in the We&s;t-India I&s;lands. Yet this was a time of war between Great-Britain, America and France.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No comet was &s;een between 1770 and 1784&mdash;a period of more than thirteen years&mdash;&s;uch an interval had not happened within 150 years, and probably not in three centuries.</NOTE> But it is a curious fact, that in tho&s;e parts of the earth mo&s;t &s;ubject to pe&s;tilence, the plague and yellow fever &s;hould have di&s;appeared at the &s;ame time; and in countries 5000 miles di&s;tant, certain kinds of di&s;ea&s;es &s;hould have lo&s;t that peculiar character which di&s;tingui&s;hes the plague.</P>
<P>But the hi&s;tory of epidemics furni&s;hes numerous in&s;tances of &s;imilar revolutions in the prevailing type or character of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>In Mr. Tytler's Treati&s;e on the plague and yellow fever, which I have ju&s;t read, I find a pa&s;&s;age, in page 379, which a&s;&s;erts that certain quotations in my letters to Dr. Currie in 1797 were made "with a view to di&s;pute the contagious nature of the yel|low fever." This is not accurate. My view was to prove a me|terial difference in the yellow fever at different times, and to &s;how certain incon&s;i&s;tencies in the rea&s;oning of my antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="036687_0705_100AA65B66E76190">It is proper now to mention that I wrote tho&s;e letters, with a view if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ettle the que&s;tion of the origin of the yellow fever, by a fair &s;tatement of facts and fair conclu&s;ions from the facts. I had not then attended to the hi&s;tory of epidemics; and it will be &s;een by one of my letters, that I had embraced the popular opinion then current, that the influenza in 1789 and 1790 was a new di&s;ea&s;e. Since I have &s;tudied this &s;ubject, I am &s;ur|pri&s;ed not only at my own ignorance, but at the ignorance of all cla&s;&s;es of men, in whatever regards the hi&s;tory of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, and the phy&s;ical phenomena of the earth and atmo&s;|phere. On this &s;ubject and whatever regards the origin of the plague and yellow fever, Mr. Tytler's Treati&s;e has di&s;appointed my hopes and expections. His hi&s;tory of pe&s;tilence is from fir&s;t to la&s;t imperfect and inaccurate. And how it is po&s;&s;ible for a man to &s;uppo&s;e that the plague was originally &s;ent upon the Jews as a puni&s;hment, and by them has been conveyed to other nations, p. 47. or that the plague in Rome in the year 80 was occa&s;ioned by infection conveyed from Jeru&s;alem, by the army of Titus in the year 70. p. 13. 45. 50. Or that it is of divine original, p. 369, any more than all other di&s;tempers&mdash;Or that it has been u&s;ually propagated by war and commerce p. 369, when it is evi|dent from &s;cripture that it was a di&s;ea&s;e in Egypt, before the days of Mo&s;es&mdash;and has in every age infe&s;ted nations who had no in|tercour&s;e with the Jews&mdash;when al&s;o it is expre&s;sly declared by Livy and Oro&s;ious to have been u&s;ually in Rome in time of peace&mdash;I &s;ay, how it is po&s;&s;ible, in this period of the world, for &s;uch opinions to exi&s;t, I cannot conceive.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of contagion al&s;o, or rather infection, Mr. Tytler, has adopted the common theory&mdash;a theory acknowleged to be inadequate to the &s;olution of the phenomena of pe&s;tilence, as plague and yellow fever always cea&s;e, at the proper &s;ea&s;on, when the infection is mo&s;t general.</P>
<P>The re&s;ults of my inve&s;tigations will explain mo&s;t, if not all, the difficulties attending this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The origin of pe&s;tilence is traced to e&s;&s;ential changes in the at|mo&s;phere, which recur at certain unequal periods. The evi|dence of the&s;e changes are certain epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, as mea&s;les,
<PB N="351" REF="036687_0706_100AA65D0F0DCE38">
affections of the throat, and e&s;pecially influenza, which pervades the globe or large portions of it within a few months or at mo&s;t, in two years. Near the time of the&s;e phenomena, and u&s;ually &s;ub&s;equent to the influenza, the plague occurs in Egypt and Con|&s;tantinople, and if the change in the atmo&s;phere is very great, the plague occurs in all parts of the Levant and in other parts of Africa, Europe and A&s;ia. At the &s;ame time, in the more cool and healthy regions of the north, epidemics of a milder type than the plague, but malignant and infectious, prevail, and in &s;hort, ordinary di&s;ea&s;es a&s;&s;ume new and more fatal &s;ymptoms. In America, the &s;ame or &s;imilar changes are ob&s;erved. The fe|ver of the We&s;t-Indies, which is u&s;ually not infectious, becomes more malignant and a&s;&s;umes in a degree the character of the plague. In our large cities, the autumnal remitting fever is changed into the &s;ame malignant form, and the country &s;uffers by mea&s;les, &s;car|latina, dy&s;entery, typhus and remitting fevers. The&s;e changes u&s;ually take place in both hemi&s;pheres at the &s;ame time; but &s;ometimes the pe&s;tilential principle &s;eems to be more &s;evere on one continent or in one country, than in another</P>
<P>The&s;e changes are u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;hed by vi&s;ible and remark|able phenomena in the natural world.</P>
<P>The periods of pe&s;tilence are unequal and indefinite&mdash;&s;ome|times of only five or &s;ix years duration; at other times, extend|ing to ten or fifteen years. But in the latter ca&s;e, the epidemics mentioned u&s;ually run through a country twice&mdash;that is, two pe&s;tilential periods occur, without an interval of time.</P>
<P>During the&s;e periods, contagion and infection aid the propaga|tion of certain di&s;ea&s;es, particularly the mea&s;les, &s;mall-pox, whooping cough and angina maligna. In the dy&s;entery, yellow fever and plague, infection has its effect and obviou&s;ly &s;preads the di&s;ea&s;es. But all tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es originate without infection, in all countries where the heat, moi&s;ture or other local cau&s;e will permit the di&s;ea&s;e to exi&s;t. In &s;ome ca&s;es, they are introduced and &s;pread &s;olely by infection, but they are then always within human control, and it is the fault of man, if the &s;phere of their operation is not very limited. In mo&s;t ca&s;es, the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es have the unequivocal characters of local epidemics, and no human power can re&s;train them.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="036687_0707_100AA65FCD38E340">On the &s;ubject of cure, if I may be permitted to have an opin|ion, I &s;hould concur with Mr. Tytler in the preference of the diaphoretic method. Circum&s;tances may indeed defeat this meth|od, and compel the phy&s;ician to adopt others. But from the in|dications of nature, and the immen&s;e capacity of vapor to ab|&s;orb heat, I take per&s;piration to be the natural remedy for fever.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of the proximate cau&s;e of the plague, the opin|ions of Mr. Tytler are highly re&s;pectable. I fully agree with him in the influence of the electrical fluid. I believe this active and ela&s;tic principle to be the great agent in all the changes vi&s;i|ble and invi&s;ible, in our atmo&s;phere, and I cannot but think my inve&s;tigations have unlocked very important &s;ecrets on that point. I believe al&s;o that this fluid is the immediate agent in &s;upporting life, and the intellectual powers. Received into the lungs, it &s;upplies the body with heat, and by its ela&s;tic power, dilates tho&s;e organs of life to receive new &s;upplies. The machinery of the body is thus calculated, while it la&s;ts, to pre&s;erve perpetual motion. At the &s;ame time, this fluid, by the &s;ame ela&s;tic power, becomes the medium of &s;en&s;ation, throughout the nervous &s;y&s;tem, and by its in&s;tantaneous motions, communicates &s;en&s;ation and thought, with the celerity of lightning.</P>
