<Q><HI>Yet no man remembered that &s;ame poor man.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE conduct of man towards his fellow creatures in different circum&s;tances, not only affords a curious &s;ubject for &s;pecu|lations but, if carefully traced out, would be found fully to develope the principles of human action. The circum&s;tances, in which mankind are providentially placed, rather than the characters they &s;u&s;tain, &s;eem to be the crite|rion, by which is determined the degree of re&s;pect, that &s;hall be paid them. Hence, real worth, if cloth|ed in rags, mu&s;t live and die in ob&s;curity; while gaudy attire, and high &s;ounding titles procure for many a worthle&s;s per&s;on, a tribute of re&s;pect, which is due to the virtuous only. For this cau&s;e, among others, did Solomon in&s;cribe on all the pur&s;uits of human life, "vanity of vanities." And to place the &s;ubject in a &s;triking light, he &s;ets before us a familiar example, expre&s;&s;ed in the plain, unadorned language
<PB N="4" REF="037427_0004_100D40E85619A378">
of in&s;piration. "There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king again&s;t it, and be&s;ieged it, and built great bulwarks again&s;t it. Now there was found in it a poor wi&s;e man, and he by his wi&s;dom delivered the city;" but mark the returns which he received: "<HI>Yet no man remembered that &s;ame poor man.</HI>" Incapable through poverty of flattering their pride by a &s;plendid equipage, or grat|ifying their appetites by &s;umptuous entertainments, his good deeds are forgotten, he mu&s;t retire to his former ob&s;curity, and have the mortification of ex|periencing the ingratitude of a people, whom he had &s;aved from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Were mankind univer&s;ally di&s;po&s;ed to render to each other that tribute, which gratitude requires, the circum&s;tances, in which per&s;ons might be placed, would make no alteration as to the re&s;pect, which would be paid them: A real benefactor, whether he were found among the rich or the poor, the high or the low, would ever receive the tribute of a grateful remembrance. This conci&s;e narrative, therefore, virtually contains this charge again&s;t mankind, that they are not naturally inclined to remember their benefactors, as they ought to remember them.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this general propo&s;ition, we &s;hall fir&s;t &s;ay how a benefactor &s;hould be remembered; and then offer &s;ome con&s;iderations to &s;how, that mankind are not naturally inclined thus to remember them.</P>
<P>1. We are to &s;ay how a benefactor &s;hould be re|membered. Barely mentioning &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e; <HI>remember the poor; remember thy Creator,</HI> is &s;ufficient to convince any per&s;on, that the term <HI>re|member</HI> often includes more, than merely retaining in
<PB N="5" REF="037427_0005_100D40E9E33824D0">
the mind an idea of the thing remembered. He, that &s;ays to the hungry, <HI>be ye fed,</HI> or to the naked, <HI>be ye clothed,</HI> does more than merely retain in his mind an idea of their nece&s;&s;ities, and yet, his conduct falls &s;hort of what is implied in remembering the poor. In all ca&s;es, it is nece&s;&s;ary, that <HI>works</HI> bear te&s;timony to the truth of our a&s;&s;ertions, and therefore, by works, as well as by words or thoughts mu&s;t we remember a benefactor.</P>
<P N="1">1. We &s;hould remember our benefactors by doing them good. That command, which bids us "pray for tho&s;e that hate us, and do good unto tho&s;e, that de&s;pitefully u&s;e us," doubtle&s;s requires, that we do good unto tho&s;e, that do good unto us. This is what the law of benevolence requires; it is what the nat|ural unenlightened con&s;cience of all mankind teaches them, as their duty. Are our benefactors in nece&s;&s;i|tous circum&s;tances? we &s;hould cheerfully afford them relief, if it be in our power. Are their characters un|ju&s;tly a&s;per&s;ed? we &s;hould openly e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e, and defend their injured innocence. Do they merit a re&s;pectful attention? we &s;hould grant it to them in cu&s;tomary forms. And, does their devotedne&s;s to our intere&s;ts claim our confidence! we &s;hould &s;pare them the painful &s;en&s;ations, which re&s;ult from &s;eeing a &s;tranger preferred before them&punc; Sen&s;ations, which in|gratitude alone would ever wi&s;h to excite. And, though our chief and principal attention is to be paid them, while living, yet the "pale &s;hades of death" have their demands, and the voice of a benefactor calls to us even from the grave. There is &s;omething inhuman in the thought of vilifying the memory of the dead, or even, in forbearing to pay &s;ome te&s;timo|ny
<PB N="6" REF="037427_0006_100D40EB72F55D48">
of re&s;pect to a departed friend. A re&s;pectful at|tention to the decea&s;ed, is what every benefactor has a right to expect; it is what humanity requires; it is what that providence, which reminds us of our own approaching di&s;&s;olution, demands.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our benefactors are to be remembered by an imitation of their benevolent example. The &s;imple idea of a benefactor implies &s;omething, that is worthy of imitation. It implies, that an unpurcha&s;ed good has been conferred: And, whatever may have been the conduct of a benefactor in other re&s;pects, it pro|po&s;es to our imitation, in one in&s;tance at lea&s;t, the example of a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition. An example, which gratitude requires, that we ever bear upon our hearts. Are we, therefore, in circum&s;tances, in which we can do good to others, and do it not? we are chargeable with having forgotten the example of our benefactors. Are we able to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, to &s;upply what is lacking in the circum&s;tances of the needy, and to cheer with the &s;oothings of friend&s;hip the di&s;con&s;olate &s;ufferer, and do it not? each bene|faction, which we have received, reproaches us with the forgetfulne&s;s of ingratitude. Are we capable of doing good to public bodies&mdash;to &s;ocieties&mdash;to our country, and do it not? tho&s;e, who have devoted them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of their country, tho&s;e, who have "jeoparded their lives in the high places of the field," and the blood, which has been &s;hed, in defend|ing the rights of mankind, ri&s;e up again&s;t us, and re|&s;ent the neglect, as a fruit of the ba&s;e&s;t ingratitude.</P>
<P N="3">3. Our benefactors are to be remembered by be|ing con&s;idered and received as a gift from God. It is not &s;ufficient, that we trace the &s;treams of benefi|cence,
<PB N="7" REF="037427_0007_100D40EE06671D48">
which are flowing to us in many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to their immediate &s;ources, and render due <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> a fellow creature; we &s;hould follow them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their ul|timate &s;ource, and learn to adore that divine good|ne&s;s, which animates all nature, and demands, from the united tongues of created intelligences, a tribute of thankful prai&s;e. It is God, we are told, that forms the &s;pirit of man within him, that gives a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d an ability to exert it: It is God, that prepares the heart, that moves the di&s;po&s;ition, and prompts to action: And, it is God, that directs the &s;teps of man, and enables him to put his benevolent intentions into execution. The whole proce&s;s, there|fore, originates ultimately in divine goodne&s;s; and, while we forget, that this is the ca&s;e, or neglect to acknowledge it by an affectionate attachment to the &s;ervice of our Maker, we do not remember, in their true character, tho&s;e, who have been made the in&s;tru|ments of divine goodne&s;s to us, and are not in a &s;uit|able &s;ituation to render them tho&s;e con&s;tant returns of gratitude, which they have de&s;erved. While we forget <HI>even in our hearts,</HI> that there is a God, on whom our benefactors are entirely dependent, we a&s;|&s;ign to them, in a certain &s;en&s;e, the rank of Gods, and when we find them incapable of &s;upporting that &s;tation in the &s;cale of being, to which we in an idola|trous manner have exalted them, we are generally ready, not only to pull them down, but even to tear from their brows the laurels, which they really de|&s;erve to wear.</P>
<P>Upon this idea, I would wi&s;h to be indulged the liberty of dwelling for a moment, as it not only &s;hows the importance of religion to tho&s;e, who have de&s;erv|ed
<PB N="8" REF="037427_0008_100D40F1233F9710">
well of their country, but al&s;o as it points out a con&s;iderable &s;ource of that complaint and calumny, which is often ca&s;t upon the admini&s;tration of civil government. While we, from a principle of religion, which governs our <HI>feelings</HI> as well as our <HI>belief,</HI> a&s;cribe the &s;ucce&s;s, which attends the plans of a General, or a Politician, to the goodne&s;s of an over-ruling Provi|dence, and revere the men, who have been our ben|efactors, as in&s;truments in the hands of God, we a&s;|&s;ign them the place, that belongs to them; we give them ju&s;t the prai&s;e, that is their due, and, upon a rever&s;e of fortune, &s;hould not find our&s;elves greatly di&s;po&s;ed to load them in an ungrateful manner, with unmerited calumny. The thought, that they are but in&s;truments in the hands of a holy and wi&s;e God, will forbid every complaint, and be a powerful check again&s;t a&s;cribing their want of &s;ucce&s;s to a want of benevolence. On the contrary, while we forget, that there is an over-ruling hand in all the&s;e events, and a&s;cribe the benefit received almo&s;t wholly to the wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s of the immediate agent, we &s;hall be ready, upon every unfavorable occurrence, to &s;u&s;|pect, that he has not exerted him&s;elf as he might have done, or, that, under the influence of &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter motive, he is di&s;po&s;ed to neglect our good, or to make us the victims of his own ambition or revenge. And by &s;uch a thought we at once bla&s;t his well-earned laurels, and rob him entirely of the tribute of a thank|ful heart, which his conduct has de&s;erved. By a&s;crib|ing too much to our benefactors, in the in&s;tances, in which they have done us good, we are naturally led to demand too much of them in future, and, if our expectations are not equalled, we are &s;trongly inclined
<PB N="9" REF="037427_0009_100D40F2ADAEE2A0">
to load them with cur&s;es, and to forget, that we ever owed them any returns of gratitude. So long, therefore, as the cour&s;e of human affairs is variable, &s;o long as pure religion does not warm the hearts of mankind in general, &s;o long the wi&s;e&s;t, and mo&s;t faith|ful admini&s;trators of public affairs have no rea&s;on but to expect, that their admini&s;tration will at times be cen&s;ured in an ungrateful manner. However grati|fying, of cour&s;e, it may be to the vanity of the hu|man heart to have its &s;ucce&s;&s;es attributed wholly to it&s;elf, to the exclu&s;ion of divine Providence, it is in fact putting it into a &s;ituation, that is incompatible with that &s;teady, per&s;evering re&s;pect, which gratitude demands. It is, therefore, the &s;pirit of religion only, that places our benefactors in their true light, and &s;ecures to them a continuance of that attention and confidence, which their benevolent conduct has mer|ited; and of cour&s;e, where true religion is wanting, it is impo&s;&s;ible, that there &s;hould be that remem|brance of a benefactor, which there ought to be.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hown how a benefactor &s;hould be re|membered, we proceed</P>
<P>II. To offer &s;ome con&s;iderations to prove, that mankind are not naturally inclined thus to remem|ber them.</P>
<P>It is a painful ta&s;k to draw the dark &s;ide of the hu|man character, and point out tho&s;e dete&s;table princi|ples, by which the human heart is often actuated. It is nece&s;&s;ary, however, that it &s;hould at times be done. Our divine Redeemer, who&s;e compa&s;&s;ionate &s;oul could weep at the follies and &s;ins of an apo&s;tate world, was much employed in unfolding the human heart, and in expo&s;ing the hypocri&s;y and wickedne&s;s,
<PB N="10" REF="037427_0010_100D40F5F34C2FD8">
to which it is often abandoned. And, in following his example as a public teacher, it is frequently nec|e&s;&s;ary, that we lay a&s;ide the language of palliation, that we &s;trip off the di&s;gui&s;e of external appearance, and expo&s;e in all their deformity, the wor&s;t principles by which the human heart is actuated.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be thought, that forgetfulne&s;s of benefactors is no very prominent feature in the hu|man character; and, that in this, they err le&s;s, than in many other re&s;pects. A regard, however, for truth, and a belief in the ju&s;tne&s;s of &s;acred repre&s;en|tations, bids me a&s;&s;ert, that &s;uch an opinion is not well founded; and, we pre&s;ume, that a careful re|view of the conduct of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> will fully ju&s;tify the a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of this, let the following things be no|ticed.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the human character there is a great degree of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. The numerous commands, which are found in the word of God, <HI>to love our neighbors, and to look on the things of others,</HI> as well as the more po&s;i|tive declarations, that <HI>all &s;eek their own things,</HI> are a &s;ufficient proof, that &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is deeply rooted in the human heart. And, in &s;upport of this painful truth, may we not appeal to that conduct, which generally characterizes the different cla&s;&s;es of mankind? Is it not &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, that lies at the foundation of a de&s;ire for property, and which &s;ugge&s;ts to bu&s;y &s;eekers that variety of methods, which are adopted for its attain|ment? Is it not &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, that &s;timulates to exce&s;|&s;ive indulgence, tho&s;e, who &s;acrifice at the altar of &s;en&s;ual intemperance? Is it not &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, that nour|i&s;hes the di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions of anger, envy and re|venge,
<PB N="11" REF="037427_0011_100D40F787348738">
from which a conduct &s;hocking to humanity often proceeds? Is it not &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, that excites am|bitious de&s;ires, that &s;upplies an heroic courage, and that often prompts to actions called great and noble? Is it not &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, that leads many in the paths of morality, while pride or ambition only curb the im|pure de&s;ires which rankle in their hearts? Is it not &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, that leads us almo&s;t to adore a truly great and con&s;picuous character, who&s;e virtues may flatter the vanity of his admirers, while a poor benefactor, from whom no &s;uch advantage is to be derived, is neglected and forgotten? And, is it not owing to the prevalence of the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition, that com|plaints, rebellions and revolutions are much more frequently attempted under a mild and peaceable ad|mini&s;tration, from which little is to be dreaded, than under one, that is more &s;evere? And when the&s;e things are con&s;idered, is it po&s;&s;ible not to believe, that mankind are naturally &s;elfi&s;h, and of cour&s;e, that they are not naturally inclined to render to their benefac|tors that, which is their due? To &s;ome, it is true, we may be ready to make &s;uitable returns, becau&s;e in &s;ome circum&s;tances, &s;uch a conduct would accord with the &s;elfi&s;h feelings of the heart; but, &s;o long as there is one benefactor unnoticed or unrewarded by us, let his circum&s;tances be what they may, &s;o long we claim in vain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a thankful di&s;po&s;i|tion. While, therefore, the evidence, that &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s prevails to &s;o great a degree in the human heart, is &s;o complete, we cannot believe, that a real di&s;po&s;ition to remember benefactors, prevails there al&s;o.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mankind are naturally attached to certain &s;y&s;|tems, and divide them&s;elves into certain parties, with|in
<PB N="12" REF="037427_0012_100D40FA59AD1AD8">
the limits of which their benevolence is generally confined. There is &s;carcely any &s;ubject, in which mankind are generally intere&s;ted, re&s;pecting which they are not divided. And the effects of &s;uch divi&s;|ions are almo&s;t invariably incon&s;i&s;tent with that im|partial regard, which public benefactors have a right to expect. In religion, the friends of certain &s;enti|ments cla&s;s them&s;elves together, imbibe a peculiar re|gard for each other, and will generally extol the vir|tues, and endeavor to exalt as much as po&s;&s;ible, the reputation of their own denomination; while tho&s;e, who have embraced a different &s;y&s;tem of faith, are greatly di&s;regarded, and their virtues treated with pe|culiar coldne&s;s. In politics, the effects of party &s;pirit are not le&s;s evident, nor are the different parties in any re&s;pect more ju&s;t in their comparative repre&s;entations of each other. In &s;ocial life, the di&s;tinction of fa&s;h|ionable and vulgar is chargeable with the &s;ame con|&s;equences, though on a &s;maller &s;cale. And, may I not add, that particular &s;ocieties, not excepting even tho&s;e, which are profe&s;&s;edly founded on the princi|ples of benevolence, are not free from party attach|ment, or from its unhappy con&s;equences. A public benefactor, therefore, can only expect, that his mer|its will be duly appreciated, and rewarded by tho&s;e of his own party, and need not be &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;hould he, from others receive the coldne&s;s of inattention, or the more painful effects of unju&s;t &s;u&s;picion or ma|licious calumny.</P>
<P N="3">3. This painful truth is further evident from that general neglect of religion, which prevails among mankind. When we con&s;ider, that all things here below are the workman&s;hip of a God, and that all
<PB N="13" REF="037427_0013_100D40FCA24963B8">
events are under a &s;uperintending Providence, we can|not but <HI>believe,</HI> whatever we may <HI>feel,</HI> that "every good and perfect gift cometh down from the Father of Lights." And, when this is con&s;idered, would it be po&s;&s;ible, if we were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a right di&s;po&s;ition, for us to forget our maker? Would it be po&s;&s;ible for us not to notice in a mo&s;t thankful manner the hand, that &s;upports, defends, and nouri&s;hes us from day to day? The fact, however, is certain: We do forget our heavenly benefactor: We do conduct toward him in a mo&s;t ungrateful manner. In&s;tead of reverential expre&s;&s;ions, his ears are often a&s;&s;ailed with the lan|guage of profanene&s;s and bla&s;phemy. In&s;tead of a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of dependence, and a thankful acknowledg|ment for favors, he hears a vainglorious boa&s;ting in language like this, "by the &s;trength of my hands I have done it, and by my wi&s;dom, for I am prudent." In&s;tead of confidence in God, and a cordial reliance upon his grace through a crucified Savior, he &s;ees little but a pre&s;umptuous re&s;ting on an arm of fle&s;h. And, in&s;tead of a cordial obedience to his commands, he beholds every where the mo&s;t evident tokens of a mo&s;t unnatural rebellion. Such are the natural feel|ings of the human heart, and at &s;uch a di&s;tance is it from the exerci&s;e of that religion, the fir&s;t precept, of which is, "thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart." Now, if this be the ca&s;e, where is the evidence, that mankind are naturally ju&s;t to their benefactors? Why is it, that their fir&s;t and greate&s;t benefactor is totally di&s;regarded? Or, can they be &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s a principle of ju&s;tice even to their fellow creatures, while they are &s;o evidently unju&s;t to their Creator?</P>

We may, therefore, a&s;&s;ume it as an undoubted truth, that mankind have not naturally within them, that di&s;po&s;ition, which is implied in remembering a benefactor: A truth, which we ought to lament, and for which it becomes us to be deeply humbled before a holy, and a righteous God. It is a truth, which ought to be mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly impre&s;&s;ed upon our minds this day, le&s;t, while we are attempting to do ju&s;tice to the memory of one, who was rai&s;ed up in divine Providence for our good, we are found want|ing in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of our duty.</P>
<P>While we are endeavoring to realize and improve that afflictive Providence, which has this day called us together, we may doubtle&s;s be allowed to adopt the language of in&s;piration, and &s;ay, "truly a great man is fallen in our I&s;rael." Whether we con&s;ider him in public or in private life; in the field, in the cabinet, or in the dome&s;tic circle, he appears equal|ly the great man&mdash;the con&s;picuous character. His cool un&s;haken courage, while encountering a &s;upe|rior foe; his addre&s;s in &s;upplying a want of the means of defence, and in &s;ecuring the confidence of his country amid&s;t complicated di&s;a&s;ters; his ani|mated zeal, which could transform a &s;mall undi&s;ci|plined band of men into a formidable army; the plans, which he concerted, and by which he was en|abled to free our land from a powerful inva&s;ion; his coolne&s;s and deliberation in council; his readine&s;s to li&s;ten to advice, coming from whatever quarter it might; his ardent love of liberty, and his zealous attachment to the cau&s;e of his country, all declare, that he was rai&s;ed up for the time and place, in which he lived, and that he was particularly fitted for the
<PB N="15" REF="037427_0015_100D4100950D53F8">
important part, which he acted upon the public thea|tre of life. And when to this portrait of his public character, we add the virtues, that adorned the man; his amiable di&s;po&s;ition; his love of indu&s;try and or|der; his freedom from vice of every de&s;cription; his attachment to the arts of civilized life; his rev|erence for the name of God; and his uniform re|gard for religion, we behold one of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed characters, which the higher &s;phere of life has ever produced: We behold one who, as we tru&s;t, was truly wi&s;e; one, who to us was highly u&s;eful; and one, who will ever demand our grateful remembrance.</P>
<P>While he was living, there were not wanting num|bers, who duly appreciated his merits, and who uni|formly paid him that tribute of re&s;pect and confidence, which was his due. Did &s;u&s;picion attack the purity of his intentions? Numbers were found, who readily &s;tepped forward and e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e. Did partyi&s;m mi&s;repre&s;ent the mea&s;ures, which he adopted? Num|bers were found, who readily ju&s;tified them, and ex|po&s;ed the in&s;idious de&s;igns of his oppo&s;ers. Did en|vy indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;trive to blacken his character, and prejudice the minds of his countrymen again&s;t him? Numbers were found, who met &s;uch attempts with a becoming re&s;entment, and &s;upported with a grateful firmne&s;s, both his character and the mea&s;ures of his admini&s;tration. Though &s;ome few may be chargea|ble with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">hankful neglect, yet the unanimity, with which the highe&s;t and mo&s;t dignified office in the be|&s;towment of his country was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively conferred upon him, and the unaffected te&s;timonials of &s;orrow, which his death has fixed upon every countenance, clearly evince, that the great body of the people are
<PB N="16" REF="037427_0016_100D410301E375A0">
free from &s;uch a charge. But, have we remembered him with that di&s;po&s;ition, which real gratitude im|plies? WASHINGTON was born in the higher &s;phere of life; he was ever a con&s;picuous and dignified char|acter, and it has long been our glory, that we have duly noticed and rewarded his merits. But, while our minds are, as it were, dazzled by the &s;plendors of this great man, may it not be, that there is &s;ome "poor, wi&s;e man," who as really claims our grati|tude, though not to the &s;ame degree, but, who is now &s;uffering the pain and mortification of unmerited ne|glect? If there is &s;uch a character thus neglected by us, WASHINGTON him&s;elf feels the neglect; for, it proves, that the re&s;pect, which we have &s;hown to him, ari&s;es rather from the lu&s;tre, which his greatne&s;s re|flects upon our&s;elves, than from a really grateful di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The virtues of our WASHINGTON are al&s;o to be imitated, or we do but poorly requite the good, which he has done for us. And in this view there is much, that claims our attention. When called by the voice of his country to defend her in&s;ulted rights; his ready obedience, entering the field with &s;carcely a di&s;tant pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, devoting him&s;elf entirely to the good of his country, and uniformly refu&s;ing any conpen&s;ation for his numerous and painful &s;er|vices, evinced the benevolence of his di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;ays unto us, <HI>go ye and do likewi&s;e.</HI> Amid&s;t the tu|mults, irregularities and temptations of war, the uni|formity of his temper, the propriety of his conduct, and the frowns with which he invariable and &s;evere|ly checked every &s;pecies of profanene&s;s, intemperance and di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of manners, atte&s;t both the purity,
<PB N="17" REF="037427_0017_100D410601F7FB88">
and firmne&s;s of his heart, and &s;ay unto us, <HI>go ye and do likewi&s;e.</HI> In the dignified &s;tation of Pre&s;ident, his attachment to the principles of union, to the harmo|ny of jarring parties, which mu&s;t ever exi&s;t in a land, where freedom of thought and &s;peech is the boa&s;t of each individual, and to a &s;y&s;tem of neutrality amid&s;t the di&s;turbances of Europe, clearly indicate an ardent love of his country, and &s;ay unto us, though acting in a humbler &s;phere, <HI>go ye and do likewi&s;e.</HI> In leaving the arduous ta&s;k of government, in de&s;cending vol|untarily to the rank of a private citizen, and in &s;ub|mitting, without any kind of indignant re&s;entment, to be cho&s;en to &s;ome of the lowe&s;t offices of civil gov|ernment, he evinced &s;uch an uncommon greatne&s;s or magnanimity of mind, as is of it&s;elf &s;uperior to grades or di&s;tinctions of honor, and thereby &s;ays unto us, <HI>go ye and do likewi&s;e.</HI> In private life, the delicate at|tachment, which he &s;howed to his companion; the tenderne&s;s, with which he treated his dome&s;tics; the gravity and moral purity of his deportment; the at|tention, which he paid to the arts of civilized life, and to u&s;eful indu&s;try; and the uniform regard, which he di&s;covered for the religion of his forefa|thers, form a mo&s;t beautiful character, and &s;ay unto us, in a manner peculiarly per&s;ua&s;ive, <HI>go ye and do likewi&s;e.</HI> Though like us, he was but man, and though at certain times the imperfections of human|ity might be vi&s;ible in his conduct, yet there was cer|tainly much in him, that we may well remember by a careful imitation. And if we do it not, whatever may be the te&s;timonials of our grief and re&s;pect up|on this occa&s;ion, we do but, in fact, in&s;ult the mem|ory of this truly great and virtuous man.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="037427_0018_100D41085D3BA868">
But while we are endeavoring to remember in a grateful manner, the good deeds, which he has done for his country, we &s;hould be careful not to forget, that all is to be con&s;idered as a gift from God. Up|on a &s;ubject like this, we are perhaps in danger of a&s;cribing too much to the in&s;trument, and of paying to that a kind of idolatrous homage, while we almo&s;t forget the Great, the Wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;er of all human e|vents. It ought ever to be deeply impre&s;&s;ed upon our minds, that, whatever may be a&s;cribed to our benefactors, the glory &s;hould ultimately redound to that God, who gave them to us. We &s;hould never forget, that it was God, that rai&s;ed up to us a WASH|INGTON, and qualified him for the important part, which he was called to act. We &s;hould never forget, that it was God, that di&s;po&s;ed him to &s;tep forth in defence of his country's rights; that endowed him with a cool and &s;teady courage in the day of battle; that gave him per&s;evering firmne&s;s in the mid&s;t of di&s;a&s;ters and gloomy pro&s;pects; that concerted his plans; that fought his battles; that bid him con|quer; and made him, in a political &s;en&s;e, the father of his country. We &s;hould never forget, that, what|ever is due to the illu&s;trious man, the glory of his whole life mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to that invi&s;ible hand, that gave, that made him u&s;eful, and that has again taken him away.</P>
<P>Permit me now, in applying the &s;ubject more im|mediately to our&s;elves, to a&s;k, whether, con&s;idering the things, which have been &s;aid, we have not rea&s;on to look within our&s;elves, and to blu&s;h for the degen|eracy of our hearts? Can we &s;ay amid&s;t all the re|&s;pect, which we have &s;hewn him; amid&s;t all the con|fidence,
<PB N="19" REF="037427_0019_100D410AC5C35F50">
that we have repo&s;ed in him; and amid&s;t all the te&s;timonials of grief, which his death has oc|ca&s;ioned, that we have really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e feelings, which are implied in remembering a benefactor? Can we &s;ay, that we have uniformly imitated his example, and a&s;cribed his merits and u&s;efulne&s;s to the good|ne&s;s of an over-ruling Providence? Can we &s;ay, that our hearts like his, have been filled with a love of vir|tue for virtue's &s;ake; and that the &s;incerity of our re|ligion te&s;tifies, that we are not unmindful of our divine benefactor? Have we not, on the contrary, rea&s;on to mourn, and &s;hould not this day be to us a day of &s;or|row, a day of deep humiliation and repentance be|fore that God, whom we have almo&s;t uniformly &s;lighted? And does not that &s;olemn providence, which has this day called us together, and which teaches us, that no qualifications, no character, nor no &s;itua|tion is a pre&s;ervative from the grave, urge upon us this duty, in a manner peculiarly forcible?</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of this day's meeting, and the objects which I behold, admoni&s;h me, that, before I clo&s;e, &s;ome particular addre&s;&s;es will be expected. My fir&s;t attention is due to that &s;ociety, which, without any knowledge of the intentions of our Supreme Ex|ecutive, has made choice of this day, to manife&s;t their participation in the general &s;orrow, which now per|vades our land.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>I SHALL not take this opportunity either to ju&s;|tify, or to condemn the principles of your in&s;titution, not even &s;o far as they are &s;ubmitted to public in|&s;pection. An object of more importance and &s;olem|nity
<PB N="20" REF="037427_0020_100D410D9AE51608">
demands our attention. A tribute of gratitude is due to the memory of our beloved WASHINGTON; and &s;till more, to that God, who in goodne&s;s has fa|vored us with &s;uch a gift. While that afflictive Prov|idence, which has taken from you an illu&s;trious broth|er, and from our country a faithful parent, bids our tears to flow, it is our duty, not only to &s;ubmit to the hand of God, but to endeavor to improve in the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible manner, this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>It is not to be denied, that the in&s;titution of Ma&s;on|ry receives a real lu&s;tre from the name of WASHING|TON. It is your part, on the contrary, to &s;ee, that the in&s;titution does not eventually prove a di&s;grace to him. How much &s;oever you may pride your&s;elves in his virtues, it is &s;till a truth, which you ought to feel, that the nature and tendency of your in&s;titution will be judged of, in part, by the characters, which you &s;u&s;tain. If, therefore, while you boa&s;t of a fra|ternal connection, you &s;hould be guilty of bringing a &s;tigma upon the in&s;titution, and, in that way, of in&s;ulting his memory with a conduct, at which he him&s;elf would blu&s;h, how could you an&s;wer it to his injured virtues? If, from your mouths the lan|guage of profanene&s;s &s;hould often be heard; if your &s;ocial meetings &s;hould be devoted to bacchanali|an revels; if they &s;hould be pro&s;tituted to the ba&s;e purpo&s;es of political intrigue, if your names &s;hould be enrolled among the di&s;&s;olute di&s;turbers of do|me&s;tic felicity; if you &s;hould be found favoring each other at the expen&s;e of the rights of your fellow cit|izens; if, in fine, there &s;hould be in you an apparent contempt of the cro&s;s of our divine Redeemer, with what propriety could you be con&s;idered as the breth|ren
<PB N="21" REF="037427_0021_100D410F27EB40E8">
of one who&s;e life was purity it&s;elf, and who ever di&s;covered a &s;erious regard to the in&s;titutions of our holy religion? Or, if you mu&s;t be thus con&s;idered, will not the character of your illu&s;trious brother &s;uffer from the connection? Should &s;uch characters as the&s;e be indulged among&s;t you, you may po&s;&s;ibly think, that the reputation of Ma&s;onry is &s;afe, while &s;hielded by the virtues of an illu&s;trious brother. But, can you offer &s;uch an affront to humanity, as to demand, that the <HI>virtues of the dead</HI> be made to pro|tect the <HI>vices of the living?</HI></P>
<P>Do not indulge a thought, that the&s;e things are &s;poken with a view to reproach your &s;ociety, or to depreciate the in&s;titution in the view of your fellow citizens. Receive them rather as te&s;timonials of re|gard for the memory of our common defender, and as proofs of a real de&s;ire to have the re&s;pectability and u&s;efulne&s;s of your order &s;upported. Flattering enco|miums are here u&s;ele&s;s: For, you cannot be in&s;en&s;i|ble, that while the veil of concealment is indu&s;triou&s;|ly thrown over your peculiar concerns, &s;u&s;picion will be watching you in the mo&s;t critical manner; that every action and word will be &s;everely &s;crutinized, and that the character and tendency of your in&s;titu|tion will be judged of, rather by the character of the individuals, who compo&s;e it, than by any thing, that may be &s;aid re&s;pecting it. And, if in an unguarded hour you &s;hould be left to reproach the character of that augu&s;t per&s;onage, on who&s;e account you exhib|it tho&s;e badges of mourning, at your hands, doubt|le&s;s, will his country require it.</P>
<P>The &s;olemnities of this day, the precepts of benev|olence, the demands of gratitude, and the rights of
<PB N="22" REF="037427_0022_100D4110E7525478">
humanity, all require, that you take heed to your|&s;elves. And, while pre&s;&s;ing the&s;e things upon you&punc; I can, mo&s;t cordially, recommend to your imitation the example of that illu&s;trious brother who&s;e death you now lament: And, will a&s;&s;ure you, that, if you make him your con&s;tant pattern, and &s;tudy to walk in his foot&s;teps, your in&s;titution will not only be con|&s;idered as u&s;eful, but will even command the re&s;pect|ful attention of your country. Let, therefore, his venerable image be ever pre&s;ent to your minds; let a remembrance of his virtues be a check upon the fir&s;t &s;allies of every impure, every un&s;uitable de&s;ire, and, under a &s;en&s;e of your dependence, let your knees be bent in humble adoration at the throne of grace, while you &s;upplicate that divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which a|lone can lead you in the paths of virtuous u&s;efulne&s;s, and of religious improvement.</P>
<P>Beholding in this a&s;&s;embly a re&s;pectable number, who are not included in that &s;ociety, which we have ju&s;t been addre&s;&s;ing, but who are equally intere&s;ted in the &s;olemnities of this day, I &s;hall not be excu&s;ed, &s;hould I pa&s;s them by in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>I do not doubt, my friends, that you really parti|cipate in the &s;orrows of this mournful occa&s;ion, and that you are animated with an ardent de&s;ire to te&s;tify your re&s;pect for the memory of that great man, who has fallen. And, while you are mingling your tears with tho&s;e of your country, over the tomb of your beloved chief, let them not be the tears of bereaved affection merely, let them be the tears of deep re|pentance&mdash;the tears of returning gratitude.</P>
<P>Before you I have endeavored to di&s;cu&s;s an impor|tant &s;ubject, and to lead your minds, into what ap|pears
<PB N="23" REF="037427_0023_100D4112B6037BF0">
to me, to be the path of duty. May the &s;pirit of divine grace make it effectual to your hearts; That you have been wanting in returns of gratitude to this truly u&s;eful man, I would, by no means, be thought to &s;ugge&s;t. Whatever may have been the ca&s;e with others, I &s;hall be ju&s;tified in a&s;&s;erting, that, notwith&s;tanding the calumnies rai&s;ed again&s;t his ad|mini&s;tration, and the arts, which have been u&s;ed to prejudice him in your minds, your confidence has ever remained un&s;haken; you have uniformly reject|ed with a becoming re&s;entment the a&s;per&s;ions ca&s;t upon his character, and it has long been your glory, that you were the friends of your country's chief defender. But, can I &s;ay, that you have done all, that duty requires? Can I &s;ay, that &s;uitable returns of gratitude have been rendered to that God, who gave you a WASHINGTON to &s;ight your battles, to guide your councils, to teach you how to live, and again, to teach you how to die? If I find that, which I can commend, do I not al&s;o find that, which I mu&s;t in faithfulne&s;s cen&s;ure? And, may I not be allowed to improve the &s;olemn objects, which this occa&s;ion pre|&s;ents, with a view to the intere&s;ts of your immortal &s;ouls? Tran&s;port your&s;elves for a moment to the tomb of your beloved chief, and imagine, that you hear his departed &s;pirit addre&s;&s;ing you in language like this: <Q>I have pa&s;t the gloomy portals of the grave: Do you prepare to pa&s;s them al&s;o. I have pa&s;&s;ed them with compo&s;ure and &s;erenity of mind, becau&s;e my life was virtuous, and my conduct u&s;eful: Do you prepare to pa&s;s them thus, by walking in the path, which my foot&s;teps have marked. I have pa&s;&s;ed them with the glow of
<PB N="24" REF="037427_0024_100D4116B1F8D8C0">
hope, becau&s;e I confided in God, and tru&s;ted in a crucified Savior: Do you prepare to pa&s;s them thus, by &s;ubjecting every thought, and every feeling to the revealed will of your holy Sovereign. I have met my God, my final Judge in the world of &s;pir|its: Do you prepare to meet him there al&s;o, for meet him you mu&s;t, either in mercy or in anger.</Q></P>
