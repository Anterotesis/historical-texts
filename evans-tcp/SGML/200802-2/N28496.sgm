<Q>&mdash;<HI>And in thine hand it is to make great.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GREATNESS is a relative term. It is u&s;ed in different &s;en&s;es, according to the object to which it is applied. When applied to material objects, it is intended to expre&s;s large extent, or magnitude. When u&s;ed with reference to the human cha|racter, or in any intellectual or moral &s;en&s;e, it has a figurative meaning, and implies di&s;tingui&s;hed power, dignity, or excellence. In compari&s;on with the infinite and eternal God, no created being can be called great. In his glorious pre&s;ence the highe&s;t angels vail their faces, and are chargeable with comparative folly. Much le&s;s, with reference to him, can any appellation of this kind be applied to man&mdash;a being lower than the angelic ho&s;ts&mdash;a worm of the du&s;t, who, before Jehovah, mu&s;t confe&s;s him&s;elf to be <HI>nothing, and le&s;s than nothing, and vanity.</HI> But comparing one race of creatures with another; or, more particularly, comparing in|dividuals of mankind with their fellow men, we
<PB N="6" REF="037964_0005_100F9DB4E7BFDF70">
may, without impropriety, &s;peak of them as great or good, when, of the limited portion of excellence of which their nature admits, they po&s;&s;e&s;s an un|common &s;hare. For this u&s;e of terms we have the example of many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, and e&s;pe|cially of that which is now under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>David, the &s;ervant of God, was equally di&s;tin|gui&s;hed as a monarch and a &s;aint. His zeal for the wor&s;hip of God led him to conceive the plan of erecting a &s;plendid temple to his name: and, although he was not permitted to execute this plan him&s;elf, nor to &s;ee it accompli&s;hed in his day; yet, in conformity to the divine direction, he made large preparation for it before his death, and placed the bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;uch a train as rendered the execu|tion of it a more ea&s;y ta&s;k for his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or. In making this preparation, the king contributed largely of his own property; and, after having done &s;o, to the extent of his ability, he called upon the great men and princes of the land to do the &s;ame. They complied with his reque&s;t, with a degree of promptitude, willingne&s;s, and liberality, which evinced that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large portion of the &s;ame &s;pirit which animated their ma&s;ter. It was on receiving this liberal contribution from the princes of the land, that David offered up to God the humble and grateful acknowledgments of which our text is a part. <HI>Thine, O Lord,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is the greatne&s;s, and the power, and the glory, and the vic|tory, and the maje&s;ty. Both riches and honours come of thee; and in thine hand is power and might; and
<PB N="7" REF="037964_0006_100F9DB673A417C0">
in thine hand it is to make great, and to give &s;trength unto all.</HI></P>
<P>It would be ea&s;y to &s;hew, in the &s;pirit of our text, that every &s;pecies of greatne&s;s, whether in the natural, moral, or political world, comes from God. But in&s;tead of entering on this wide field, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the con&s;ideration of that greatne&s;s which is &s;ometimes be&s;towed on man. It &s;hall, therefore, be my object, in the pre&s;ent di&s;|cour&s;e, to &s;hew, THAT WHEN ANY OF THE CHIL|DREN OF MEN BECOME GREAT, IT IS GOD WHO MAKES THEM SO; and then to apply the &s;ubject to that ILLUSTRIOUS CHARACTER, for the lo&s;s of whom our country mourns.</P>
<P>The general truth of the propo&s;ition contained in our text will not, I pre&s;ume, be di&s;puted by any who are now pre&s;ent. To a chri&s;tian audience it cannot be nece&s;&s;ary to prove, that God is the &s;ource of all exi&s;tence, the giver of every faculty, and the author of all promotion. <HI>He made us, and not we our&s;elves, and the in&s;piration of the Almighty gave us under&s;tanding. He doth his will and plea&s;ure in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth. Promotion cometh neither from the ea&s;t, nor from the we&s;t, nor from the &s;outh; but God is the Judge; he putteth down one, and &s;etteth up another.</HI> In&s;tead, therefore, of dwelling on the&s;e plain and elementary principles of religion&mdash;in&s;tead of going about formally to prove, that God is the &s;ource of all human greatne&s;s, which an a&s;&s;embly of believers can never, for a moment, doubt; I &s;hall rather
<PB N="8" REF="037964_0007_100F9DB9486F4188">
reque&s;t your attention, while I endeavour to point out &s;ome of the various <HI>methods</HI> in which he makes men great, and the <HI>means</HI> by which he ordinarily accompli&s;hes their exaltation.</P>
<P>As human greatne&s;s is of different kinds, and appears under a variety of a&s;pects; &s;o the means which infinite Wi&s;dom u&s;es to rai&s;e men to it are al&s;o different. Sometimes <HI>his path,</HI> with re|&s;pect to them, <HI>is in the deep waters, and his foot&s;teps are not known.</HI> At other times his manner of con|ducting their advancement is more perceptible and plain. Let us humbly attempt to take &s;uch a view of &s;ome of the&s;e methods, as may lead us more diligently to &s;tudy, and more devoutly to admire the ways of Providence.</P>
<P>I. God &s;ometimes makes men great, by <HI>confer|ring upon them the advantage of di&s;tingui&s;hed and honourable birth.</HI> This we are particularly led to notice by our context. For we there learn, that the liberality which the royal P&s;almi&s;t acknowledges in the pa&s;&s;age before us, was di&s;played by <HI>the Chiefs of the Fathers,</HI> and by <HI>the Princes of the tribes of I&s;rael.</HI> Tho&s;e di&s;tinctions of birth which are founded upon an <HI>hereditary nobility,</HI> and upon the &s;y&s;tem of <HI>privileged orders,</HI> in general, are happily unknown in our land. I &s;ay happily, becau&s;e whatever advantages &s;uch di&s;tinctions may be &s;up|po&s;ed by &s;ome to produce, they are generally ac|knowledged to be al&s;o productive of multiplied cur&s;es, wherever they exi&s;t. To be de&s;cended from the truly great, and the really virtuous, is, indeed,
<PB N="9" REF="037964_0008_100F9DBAD7D84750">
an honour; but to be able to claim a de&s;cent from tho&s;e who&s;e elevation is merely artificial and titu|lar, is an honour only in the e&s;timation of frivolous minds. In fact, &s;uch nominal exaltation, when con&s;idered alone, is &s;o far from &s;hedding a real glory around the character to which it belongs, that it rather &s;erves to render littlene&s;s more con|temptible, and frailty or vice more odious. Still, however, God has been plea&s;ed to permit, in the arrangements of human &s;ociety, that birth &s;hould be the foundation of one &s;pecies of eminence. And where this eminence is wi&s;ely improved, like every other di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence, it may be made an in&s;trument of accompli&s;hing much good, both to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or and to the world.</P>
<P>When, therefore, the Creator brings men into exi&s;tence with this di&s;tinction, and under the&s;e advantages, he may be &s;aid to make them great, becau&s;e he places them in a con&s;picuous and re|&s;pon&s;ible &s;ituation. He gives them a weight in &s;ociety, in addition to that ari&s;ing from their per|&s;onal dignity, which they are bound to u&s;e for his glory and the general happine&s;s. In propor|tion as they are rai&s;ed above their fellow men, their means of u&s;efulne&s;s become more numerous and extended; their virtues become more precious, from the force of elevated example; their vices more poi&s;onous, from the alluring form in which they are exhibited; and their whole character more important and operative in its relations, by means of the artificial power with which it is inve&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="037964_0009_100F9DBFA3756480">
It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to add, that this is the lowe&s;t kind of greatne&s;s with which human beings can be endowed; not only becau&s;e it is merely nominal; but al&s;o, and chiefly, becau&s;e it may, in general, be &s;aid to be le&s;s connected than any other with per&s;onal excellence. It is an elevation of which the wi&s;e and the fooli&s;h, the righteous and the wicked are equally made to partake; and, there|fore, is of &s;uch a nature, as that, while it lays tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it under peculiar and &s;olemn obliga|tions, it takes away all pretext of glorying in them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>II. God &s;ometimes makes men great, <HI>by giving them a large portion of this world's goods.</HI> It is an old, and a ju&s;t maxim, that "wealth is power." It gives tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it an importance in &s;o|ciety, and a capacity for u&s;efulne&s;s, which, when properly improved, are ine&s;timably precious. When God makes men rich, he places them in a high &s;tation. He gives them an influence over their fel|low men. He furni&s;hes them with the means of promoting happine&s;s on an exten&s;ive &s;cale. It was doubtle&s;s this, among other &s;pecies of greatne&s;s, which the P&s;almi&s;t had in view in uttering the words of our text. <HI>The chiefs of the fathers, and the princes of the tribes of I&s;rael,</HI> were great by rea&s;on of their <HI>riches</HI> as well as their <HI>honours.</HI> It was on account of this di&s;tinction that their pious monarch called upon them to <HI>honour the Lord with their &s;ub&s;tance;</HI> and it was, probably, with refer|ence to them, that he acknowledged the hand of
<PB N="11" REF="037964_0010_100F9DC254913E58">
God in <HI>making great,</HI> and in <HI>giving &s;trength</HI> unto men.</P>
<P>When, therefore, the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er of all things be&s;tows on any of our race a large &s;hare of this world's goods, he may be &s;aid to make them great, provided he al&s;o be&s;tow upon them an heart to u&s;e his gifts with a noble genero&s;ity. For, let it be remembered, that mere wealth, without a di&s;|po&s;ition to make that u&s;e of it which its Giver de|&s;igned, does not con&s;titute greatne&s;s in the e&s;ti|mation of the wi&s;e and the good. On the con|trary, the rich mi&s;er is, of all characters upon earth, and in the view both of God and man, among the mo&s;t de&s;picable and mean. There is a littlene&s;s in his character to which the mo&s;t impoveri&s;hed &s;a|vage is incapable of &s;inking. It is only to tho&s;e who have joined to wealth, a benevolent and gene|rous &s;pirit, that the true elevation re&s;ulting from property belongs. There &s;eems to be an allu&s;ion to this principle in the prayer of David before us. It is probable, that in calling the princes and chief men of the land great, he had a re&s;pect, not only to the extent of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, but al&s;o to that noble elevation of mind which had prompted them to dedicate a large portion of their wealth to the wor&s;hip and glory of their Almighty Benefactor.</P>
<P>III. God makes men great, in a &s;till higher &s;en&s;e, by <HI>be&s;towing upon them di&s;tingui&s;hed intellec|tual talents.</HI> By his powers of intelligence and rea|&s;on, man is rai&s;ed above the brutal tribes. By his capacity of comparing, di&s;tingui&s;hing, and com|bining
<PB N="12" REF="037964_0011_100F9DC41D832918">
ideas, and of knowing, &s;erving, and enjoy|ing God, <HI>he is placed a little lower than the angels, and crowned with glory and honour.</HI> The &s;malle&s;t portion of this intellectual power has a degree of dignity and greatne&s;s annexed to it, which far ex|ceed all the &s;plendours of material magnificence. When we compare mind with body, or mental activity with mere inert matter, the former claims a &s;uperiority of the highe&s;t and mo&s;t important kind.</P>
<P>But, as our Creator has formed different orders of intelligent beings, &s;o he has made beings of the &s;ame order to differ among them&s;elves. To &s;ome he has given &s;mall talents; to others greater and more powerful. On tho&s;e whom he de&s;igns to em|ploy in con&s;picuous &s;tations, and to make the in|&s;truments of exten&s;ive good to the world, he u&s;u|ally confers talents of a peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hed kind. He cau&s;es them to po&s;&s;e&s;s, in an eminent degree, acutene&s;s, of perception, ingenuity of com|bination, force of rea&s;oning, and accuracy and &s;oundne&s;s of judgment. The&s;e exalted minds re|ceive and de&s;erve the name of great, becau&s;e their powers and their activity are extended. They have enlarged and comprehen&s;ive views. They are capa|ble of great undertakings. They are qualified to atchieve &s;ublime enterprizes. To them, in general, belong the deep inve&s;tigations, the &s;plendid di&s;co|veries, and the wi&s;e improvements, which adorn and elevate the character of man. And to them pertains the high prerogative of being &s;tudied and
<PB N="13" REF="037964_0012_100F9DC6BB148EB8">
admired by millions who never &s;aw their faces in the fle&s;h; and of entertaining and enlightening, by the efforts of their genius, di&s;tant nations and ages.</P>
<P>It ought, however, to be ob&s;erved, and to be born in mind, that true greatne&s;s does not con&s;i&s;t &s;o much in <HI>brilliancy of talents,</HI> as in <HI>&s;olidity, &s;trength,</HI> and <HI>per&s;everance</HI> of intellectual character. It is not the rapid and noi&s;y &s;tream, but the deep, maje&s;tic, and &s;olemn, which carries all before it. It is not the dazzling meteor, which a&s;toni&s;hes by the ve|locity of its movements, and affrights by the glare and the &s;ound of its coru&s;cations; but it is the &s;teady, &s;erene, and regularly revolving luminary, that enlightens the world. Who that reads the memoirs of a <HI>Sully</HI> will not pronounce him to have been a far greater man than <HI>Servin,</HI> that prodigy, and even mon&s;ter of talents, who&s;e character he has recorded. The powers of the latter, indeed, were &s;plendid to a degree little &s;hort of miracu|lous; but they were perverted, pro&s;tituted, and u&s;ele&s;s to the world. But the genius of the for|mer, &s;ublime in its views, practical in its tendency, and per&s;evering in its exertions, was continually planning and executing the noble&s;t enterprizes; and thus was made the in&s;trument of di&s;pen&s;ing countle&s;s ble&s;&s;ings to his country, and to mankind.</P>
<P>IV. God makes men great, <HI>by producing occa&s;ions, and di&s;po&s;ing events in &s;uch a manner as to call forth and di&s;play their talents.</HI> It is an old and familiar maxim, that "occa&s;ions make men." If by this maxim be meant, that a fortuitous concour&s;e of
<PB N="14" REF="037964_0013_100F9DCA9EA4E4F8">
cau&s;es, without the interference of any de&s;igning agent, creates and rai&s;es up di&s;tingui&s;hed charac|ters, it is undoubtedly a &s;entiment replete with im|piety. But if it be under&s;tood to mean, that the Governor of the univer&s;e makes u&s;e of great and intere&s;ting occa&s;ions, to rou&s;e, to expand, and to exhibit the faculties which he has be&s;towed, there is every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, both on the principles of philo&s;ophy and religion, that the maxim is ju&s;t.</P>
<P>It is certainly true, that in order to make a great figure on the political, military, or &s;cientific &s;tage, there mu&s;t be preparatory circum&s;tances, happy occa&s;ions, and a favourable coincidence of events. What would all the learning and wi&s;dom of the mo&s;t profound civilian avail him or the world, if no opportunity were afforded him of putting them in practice, or of bringing them, by &s;ome means, into public view? How could the mo&s;t &s;plendid mar|tial talents rai&s;e the character of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, if his lot were ca&s;t in a &s;ea&s;on of tranquillity and peace? In &s;uch a ca&s;e they mu&s;t terminate in abortive wi&s;hes, and u&s;ele&s;s de&s;igns. Great powers can only be di&s;played when great exigencies pre|&s;ent a field on which they can act. Now great exigencies can happen but &s;eldom; and, therefore, tho&s;e qualities which are mo&s;t worthy of being ad|mired and e&s;teemed by mankind, often lie hid|den, like the trea&s;ures of the undi&s;covered mine. The foot pa&s;&s;es over the golden cavern, as upon common ground, until nece&s;&s;ity or accident breaks it open, and di&s;clo&s;es its precious riches. Hence
<PB N="15" REF="037964_0014_100F9DCC29C6E2A0">
there can be little doubt, but that multitudes, who&s;e lives have glided away in an u&s;ele&s;s tenor of &s;loth and ob&s;curity, might have been highly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, and eminently u&s;eful, if an opportunity had pre&s;ented for the exertion of their powers.</P>
<LG>
<L>Full many a gem of pure&s;t ray &s;erene,</L>
<L>The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear;</L>
<L>Full many a flow'r is born to blu&s;h un&s;een,</L>
<L>And wa&s;te its &s;weetne&s;s on the de&s;ert air.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GRAY.</NOTE></L>
</LG>
<P>When God, therefore, de&s;igns to rai&s;e up a great man, he di&s;po&s;es occa&s;ions and incidents in a pro|per train for the purpo&s;e. He makes the&s;e inci|dents to operate on the mind of the future hero; and the mind of the hero again, by a kind of moral re-action, to give increa&s;ing greatne&s;s and intere&s;t to the &s;cenes in which he participates. Hence both may be &s;aid, at lea&s;t in certain &s;tages of their pro|gre&s;s, mutually to &s;tand in the relation of cau&s;e and effect to each other. Thus, the age in which men are brought into the world, the circum&s;tances of their education, the company into which they are thrown, and the events which daily take place around them, may all contribute to form and &s;trengthen the mind. They may, and doubtle&s;s do, frequently operate as &s;o many cau&s;es to generate talents, to give the ta&s;te and views an elevated di|rection, and to impart dignity and energy to the whole character.</P>
<P>Who that reads the hi&s;tory of <HI>Alexander,</HI> does not &s;ee that, humanly &s;peaking, he would have
<PB N="16" REF="037964_0015_100F9DCDB52DA9A8">
lived and died unknown, beyond the bounds of a &s;mall di&s;trict, had not the atchievements of his father <HI>Philip,</HI> and the le&s;&s;ons of his preceptor <HI>Ari&s;|totle,</HI> fired his ambition; and had not the divi&s;ions and the weakne&s;s of Per&s;ia pre&s;ented an ea&s;y road to conque&s;t and glory? Who that traces the ca|reer of the emperor <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> from the rank of a private &s;oldier, till he a&s;cended the imperial throne, can refrain from admiring the my&s;terious ways of Providence, or can doubt, for a moment, that pro|motion is affected by the power of the Mo&s;t High? Had God ca&s;t the lot of the illu&s;trious <HI>Charles</HI> of Germany in other times, or in a different &s;phere; had other princes &s;at upon the neighbouring thrones; or had the period of his reign been le&s;s di&s;tracted and critical, would he not, in all probability, have fallen &s;ilently and unnoticed down the &s;tream of time? Nay, to mention a &s;till more &s;triking and familiar in&s;tance, had the noble enthu&s;ia&s;m in fa|vour of American Independence bur&s;t forth but half a century earlier or later; or had our glorious emancipation from Britain been accompli&s;hed with|out recurring to arms; is there not every rea&s;on to believe, that the GREAT MAN, who&s;e death we de|plore, and who&s;e memory is embalmed in the hearts of a grateful people, would have been, to the end of his life, nothing more than a re&s;pectable farmer in Virginia?</P>
<P>But God not only u&s;es great and &s;plendid occa|&s;ions, as means of conducting men to eminence. In his hands the &s;malle&s;t are &s;ometimes made produc|tive
<PB N="17" REF="037964_0016_100F9DD1EC75F928">
of &s;imilar effects. Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence which, at fir&s;t view, appear trifling, often de|cide the pur&s;uits in which men engage; and the&s;e pur&s;uits are made, by the &s;ame infinite wi&s;dom, to di&s;clo&s;e the latent energies of the &s;oul; to &s;timulate into action the languid powers; to awaken a genius, which, without &s;uch events, might have &s;lumber|ed for ever. If we trace the career of &s;ome of the greate&s;t men who have ever lived, we &s;hall find, that they were rai&s;ed by unexpected means to eminence; and that events, apparently &s;mall, were made to accompli&s;h their exaltation. How often has an accidental interview, of which no con&s;e|quences were fore&s;een;&mdash;a pa&s;&s;ing civility, by which nothing extraordinary was intended;&mdash;or a matri|monial alliance, from which no material advantage was expected;&mdash;how often have trivial events of this kind led to the advancement of men, from private life, to the throne of empire, and to the command of millions!&mdash;Who that calculated on the principles of human wi&s;dom, could have fore|&s;een, that a little dome&s;tic di&s;cord would prove the fir&s;t link in a chain of cau&s;es, to advance <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> from ob&s;cure retirement to the &s;tation of chief ruler over the land of Egypt? Who that followed the &s;tripling <HI>David,</HI> when &s;ent by his father on a hum|ble errand to the I&s;raeliti&s;h army, would have im|agined, that this youthful &s;hepherd was to be led, by &s;uch a tran&s;ient vi&s;it, to become the deliverer of his countrymen from the proud Phili&s;tines, and afterwards an ornament of the Jewi&s;h throne?
<PB N="18" REF="037964_0017_100F9DD5C2C43C98">
And, to de&s;cend to more modern times, how &s;in|gular and unfore&s;een the means by which the great <HI>William,</HI> whom Britain &s;tiles her <HI>deliverer,</HI> gained the &s;overeign power of that kingdom! And how &s;mall, and apparently unimportant, the incidents by which the Empre&s;s <HI>Catharine</HI> ro&s;e, from the lowe&s;t poverty, to wield the &s;ceptre of the Ru&s;&s;ias! The&s;e, and a thou&s;and &s;imilar in&s;tances of daily occurrence, prove, that in the hands of God, not only <HI>weak things of the world can be made to con|found the mighty, and fooli&s;h things of the world to confound the wi&s;e, and things that are not, to bring to nought things which are;</HI> but al&s;o, that in&s;tru|ments the mo&s;t feeble, and circum&s;tances &s;carcely thought worthy of notice, can be made to in&s;pire with wi&s;dom, to clothe with power, and to conduct to the highe&s;t celebrity and honour.</P>
<P>V. God makes men great, by <HI>giving them the affections and the confidence of their fellow men.</HI> A man may be endowed with great talents&mdash;may be enriched with large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions&mdash;and may be called to act a con&s;picuous part on the &s;tage of human life, and yet be con&s;iderably defective in &s;ome of the attributes of greatne&s;s. If he cannot obtain the re&s;pect and attachment of tho&s;e around him, he fails in an important point. <Q>The perfection of glory, &s;ays a great and admired heathen,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CICERO.</NOTE> con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e three particulars, that the people love us, that they have confidence in us, and
<PB N="19" REF="037964_0018_100F7A86B30A19E0">
that being affected with a certain admiration to|wards us, they think we de&s;erve to be honoured.</Q> Though this &s;entiment proceeds upon principles in &s;ome degree erroneous, and, therefore, cannot be adopted, in all its extent, by a chri&s;tian, yet it doubtle&s;s contains a mixture of truth. To attain the veneration and love of our fellow men, is an important ingredient in earthly greatne&s;s. It is true, indeed, that &s;ome of the greate&s;t and be&s;t men who have ever lived, were, almo&s;t wholly, de&s;titute of it&punc; but would they not, probably, have been greater and more u&s;eful had they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed this hold on &s;urrounding minds? Repu|tation, in a &s;till higher &s;en&s;e than wealth, is power; and a kind of power highly de&s;irable, whether we have a re&s;pect to our own happine&s;s, or to the effi|cacy of our &s;ervices to others. <HI>A good name,</HI> &s;ays Solomon, <HI>is rather to be cho&s;en than great riches, and loving favour rather than &s;ilver or gold.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, when it is the will of God to make a man great, or an in&s;trument of doing exten&s;ive good to the world, he u&s;ually gives him the hearts and the confidence of tho&s;e around him. He &s;o orders events, that his actions &s;hall appear in a wi&s;e and dignified point of light, and &s;o controuls the affec|tions of men, that they &s;hall view all his conduct through a favourable medium. This popularity, when duly improved, has the be&s;t effects. It is u&s;eful to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it. It is, at once, a guard to virtue, and an excitement to duty. A con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that the eyes of the world were di|ected
<PB N="20" REF="037964_0019_100F9DDB07A20A60">
toward them, and the confidence of the world repo&s;ed in them, has animated the patriot&mdash;has fired the hero&mdash;and has given ri&s;e to &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;plendid and u&s;eful enterprizes that were ever atchieved. But public confidence, while it frequently produces happy effects on tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it, is &s;till more important with reference to their u&s;efulne&s;s in the world. The &s;phere of their influence is enlarged, in proportion to the degree in which they enjoy the good opinion of the com|munity in which they re&s;ide. Men li&s;ten with a willing ear, and with favourable prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to a teacher whom they honour. Their affectionate attachment adds weight to his example, and gives authority to his coun&s;el. Hence his exertions to do them good are more effectual than tho&s;e of others, becau&s;e they enter with readine&s;s into the &s;pirit of his plans, and cheerfully co-operate with him in his benevolent labours.&mdash;Seldom has any people &s;een a more illu&s;trious in&s;tance than we have witne&s;&s;ed, of the influence of a BELOVED NAME on the public mind. We have &s;een it unite the affections and the coun&s;els of tho&s;e who would, in all probability, have been otherwi&s;e divided. We have &s;een it, more efficacious than the exertions of official power, repre&s;s the murmurings, calm the fears, and conciliate the confidence of the di&s;cord|ant and de&s;ponding in the mo&s;t trying times.</P>
<P>VI. La&s;tly, God makes men great, <HI>by adorning their hearts with virtue and holine&s;s.</HI> This is the top&s;tone of the edifice of human promotion, with|out
<PB N="21" REF="037964_0020_100F9DDDA4F65760">
which the whole &s;tructure is imperfect. Let a man po&s;&s;e&s;s all the talents, the wealth, and the honours which a human being can enjoy, or which a grateful people can be&s;tow; yet if his bo&s;om do not expand with benevolence, and his heart do not reflect the moral image of his Creator, <HI>Tekel</HI> mu&s;t be written upon all his greatne&s;s. What the light and the genial warmth of the &s;un are to the natural world, <HI>the beauty of holine&s;s</HI> is to the &s;oul. It &s;heds a glory over all the faculties of man. It forms that <HI>divinity of nature</HI> which renders rational beings like God; and which con&s;titutes their fitne&s;s for the pure joys of his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allowed, indeed, that many of tho&s;e whom the world has called great, and who, in &s;ome re&s;pects, de&s;erved the name, have been de&s;titute of this mo&s;t noble of all di&s;tinctions. Their am|bition was wholly &s;elfi&s;h. Their views, though comprehen&s;ive, were terminated by the pre&s;ent &s;tate. Their activity was rather a cur&s;e than a ble&s;&s;ing to mankind. The characters of the mo&s;t mighty conquerors, when viewed through a proper medium, exhibit a degree of moral deba&s;ement, from which humanity, to &s;ay nothing of religion, turns away with abhorrence and &s;hame. The ut|mo&s;t wi&s;h of that great heart, for which the whole earth did not afford &s;ufficient objects of conque&s;t, was, after all, to be prai&s;ed by the Athenians. And the <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> and <HI>Pompeys</HI> of our race have waded to glory through the tears and the blood of their fel|low men.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="037964_0021_100F9DDF36A107F8">
But when the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er of all things de&s;igns to rai&s;e men to the highe&s;t pinnacle of great|ne&s;s, he adds to every other &s;pecies of elevation that &s;ublimity of virtue which &s;anctifies talents; that di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence which gives a dignity to the character; and that transformation of the whole man into the image of God, which rai&s;es the &s;oul from earth to heaven. Man never appears in &s;o truly noble and honourable a point of view, as when his faculties are directed to their proper ob|jects, and all his powers con&s;ecrated to the divine work of <HI>doing good.</HI> The hero in virtue is as much &s;uperior to the hero in conque&s;t as the heavens are higher than the earth, or as light excelleth darkne&s;s. How little did a <HI>Darius,</HI> an <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and a <HI>Nero,</HI> appear in compari&s;on with a DANIEL and a PAUL, even when the&s;e holy men were &s;tanding in bonds before them! How much does the character of an HOWARD ri&s;e above the mo&s;t powerful monarch, or the mo&s;t renowned de&s;troyer of his &s;pecies, in all his glory! To devi&s;e and execute plans for le&s;&s;ening the mi&s;eries, and promoting the happine&s;s of man, was <HI>his meat and his drink.</HI> For him no tears &s;lowed but the tears of gratitude and love. For him the lips of the widow, the fatherle&s;s, and the pri&s;oner, were opened in &s;ecret benediction. And future genera|tions &s;hall ri&s;e up and call him ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Such is the greatne&s;s of him who&s;e under&s;tand|ing is enlightened with divine knowledge, and who&s;e heart is warmed with holy love. His ta|lents are no longer devoted to the narrow plans of
<PB N="23" REF="037964_0022_100F9DE1E81E9588">
&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, but move in a wider &s;phere, and com|mand a more exten&s;ive horizon. His ambition, lately confined to temporal aggrandi&s;ement, now takes an higher aim. In&s;tead of temporal wealth and honours, he &s;eeks heavenly trea&s;ures, the ap|probation of God, and the honour of advancing his glory. In&s;tead of thir&s;ting after conque&s;t and de&s;truction, his bo&s;om is animated with the noble de&s;ire of promoting univer&s;al happine&s;s. His be|nevolence, no longer bounded by names or terri|tory, embraces the whole family of God. His hopes, in&s;tead of terminating in the pur&s;uits of earth, ri&s;e to the mo&s;t noble, &s;ublime, and excel|lent objects in the univer&s;e. And his enlarged &s;oul can now be &s;atisfied with nothing, as his &s;upreme good, but infinite excellence, and <HI>an eternal weight of glory.</HI></P>
<P>I have thus attempted, brethren, to lay before you a brief &s;ketch of &s;ome of the various means by which God rai&s;es men to di&s;tinction and great|ne&s;s To fill up the outline which has been given&punc; by a more particular recurrence to details and in|&s;tances, mu&s;t be left to your own meditations. In the mean time, I would reque&s;t your attention to a few of the numerous practical le&s;&s;ons which this &s;ubject &s;ugge&s;ts to the &s;erious mind. The follow|ing are obvious and important:</P>
<P N="1">1. If the doctrine which has been delivered be ju&s;t, then great men have no rea&s;on to glory in them&s;elves; nor are others at liberty to &s;et them up as idols. <HI>Who made them to differ from others?
<PB N="24" REF="037964_0023_100F9DE37421DEF8">
and what have they that they did not receive? If, therefore, they have received all they po&s;&s;e&s;s, why &s;hould they glory as if they had not received it?</HI> The truth is, the doctrine of our total dependence on God, for our exi&s;tence, and for every power and enjoyment connected with it, removes, at one &s;troke, all ground of pride and &s;elf-confidence in man. The mo&s;t ingenious, honourable, and ex|alted, are nothing more than JEHOVAH'S in&s;tru|ments: and, therefore, to HIM is ultimately due all the honour of their great and good actions. In contemplating, then, the virtues and &s;ervices of di&s;tingui&s;hed men, it becomes us to adopt the lan|guage of the in&s;pired P&s;almi&s;t: <HI>From thee, O Lord, both riches and honours come; and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give &s;trength unto all. Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name be the glory!</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Is it true that it belongs to God to make great? Then when tho&s;e who have been rai&s;ed to high di&s;tinction, and made eminently u&s;eful in the world, are taken away, we are taught, by this doc|trine, not to indulge in anxiety or de&s;pair. The &s;ame God who rai&s;ed them up, who girded them with &s;trength, who in&s;pired them with wi&s;dom, and who fitted them for the &s;phere in which they moved, &s;till lives, and will forever live. He can qualify others, at his plea&s;ure, to take their places, and to act in the various exigencies which may ari&s;e. For every cri&s;is which occurs in human affairs, he has his infinitely wi&s;e plan laid, and his in&s;truments
<PB N="25" REF="037964_0024_100F9DE614144240">
prepared, to do his will, in every part of the &s;cene. And from even &s;tocks and &s;tones he can rai&s;e up agents to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;es. Brethren, how con&s;oling the thought that we live under the go|vernment of &s;uch a God! What though the ob|jects of our admiration and love be taken away? What though in&s;truments on which our hopes were placed, be unexpectedly removed from the &s;tage? <HI>The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice, let the mul|titude of the i&s;les be glad thereof!</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. If the view which has been given of this &s;ub|ject be ju&s;t, then how awfully re&s;pon&s;ible is the &s;itu|ation of tho&s;e whom God has made great!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This inference, though in the original copy, was omitted in deli|vering the di&s;cour&s;e, as were &s;everal preceding and &s;ub&s;equent para|graphs, for want of time.</NOTE> <HI>Unto whom&s;oever much is given, of them will much be re|quired; and to whom God has committed much, of them will he a&s;k the more.</HI> I &s;peak to all &s;uch within my hearing&mdash;to the rich, the ingenious, the learned, and the honourable. Ye great ones of the earth! your Creator has made you eminent among men. He has put into your hands many talents. He has given you a weight in &s;ociety, and an influence over tho&s;e around you, which enable you to do exten&s;ive good, and to bring a large &s;um of glory to his name. And let me remind you, that for the u&s;e which you make of all the&s;e advantages, <HI>he will bring you into judgment.</HI> What improvement, then, are you making of your di&s;tinctions and your talents? Dreadful, indeed, will be your reckon|ing,
<PB N="26" REF="037964_0025_100F9DEAF9D7E068">
if you be found, either to have buried them in &s;loth and inaction, or to have perverted them to the unhallowed purpo&s;es of &s;in. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, better had it been for you to creep through life with the mo&s;t ob&s;cure and mean of your &s;pecies; or rather that <HI>you had never been born.</HI> Be intreat|ed, then, to con&s;ider the de&s;ign for which you were rai&s;ed to eminence, and the obligations which it lays upon you. Study to be great in virtue, in holine&s;s, in zeal for the glory of God and the pub|lic good, as well as in the objects of temporal pur|&s;uit. Thus will your elevation prove a ble&s;&s;ing to your&s;elves and to mankind. Thus will the tran|&s;ient honours of earth be but introductory to higher honours&mdash;to the &s;ceptres and thrones of glory re|&s;erved for the ju&s;t, in <HI>a better country, that is, on heavenly.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. This &s;ubject teaches us to honour tho&s;e whom God makes the in&s;truments of great good to the world: When he honours them, it is our duty to do the &s;ame: and if, in doing this, we act un|der the impre&s;&s;ion, and upon the principle, that they are his in&s;truments, we ultimately glorify him thereby.</P>
<P>And here permit me to apply the &s;ubject on which we have been meditating, to the character of that ILLUSTRIOUS MAN, on account of who&s;e death the emblem of &s;orrow &s;hrouds this &s;acred de&s;k, and for the lo&s;s of whom we behold the &s;in|gular &s;pectacle of a nation mourning.</P>
<P>It is not my intention, brethren, to &s;ubject you
<PB N="27" REF="037964_0026_100F9DEC87CB3958">
to the pain of hearing the language of &s;ervility and adulation with re&s;pect to this venerable Per&s;onage. To &s;ay nothing of other con&s;iderations, &s;uch lan|guage would be peculiarly incon&s;i&s;tent and un&s;ea|&s;onable after the doctrine which has been delivered. But I tru&s;t it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to prove, before this audience, that we are called, in duty, to take a particular notice of this &s;olemn di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence. It is our happine&s;s, and our boa&s;t, that we live under a government in which the voice of the people is the &s;upreme law; and, there|fore, the approbation and applau&s;e of this voice, &s;hould be offered as the reward of long and faithful &s;ervices to the people. Let it never be &s;aid that republicans are ungrateful. Let us te&s;tify, by our conduct, that we perceive the difference between the o&s;tentatious pomp and mockery of grief, which attend the demi&s;e of tyrants; and the ardent &s;pon|taneous affection with which a grateful people can cheri&s;h and honour the memory of a patriot and benefactor.</P>
<P>You will not con&s;ider me, in the pre&s;ent di&s;|cour&s;e, as attempting to draw, at full length, the character of this di&s;tingui&s;hed Man. This is a ta&s;k which, as it would be too arduous, is al&s;o, happily, unnece&s;&s;ary. The record of his virtues and his &s;ervices, is &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed on your hearts; his great actions form &s;o &s;plendid an object in our hi&s;|tory; and the ble&s;&s;ings flowing from them to his country are &s;o numerous and exten&s;ive, that I am per&s;uaded the feelings of your hearts, this day,

form his be&s;t eulogium. But you will indulge me while I endeavour, in a few &s;entences, to recal to your view &s;ome of tho&s;e con&s;iderations, which de|mand a tribute of gratitude and re&s;pect to his me|mory from the American people.</P>
<P>Our beloved and deplored WASHINGTON was, emphatically, A MAN WHOM GOD HAD MADE GREAT. Without the tin&s;el ornament of titled nobility&mdash;without the advantage of what is called di&s;tingui&s;hed and honourable birth, he was rai&s;ed by the Governor of the world to a degree of great|ne&s;s, of which the hi&s;tory of man has furni&s;hed but few examples. He was not, indeed, endowed with tho&s;e brilliant and dazzling talents, which many erroneou&s;ly imagine to be alone e&s;timable. His mind was of an higher order. Providence de|&s;igned him to move in a &s;phere in which a digni|fied prudence, &s;oundne&s;s of judgment, firmne&s;s, &s;elf command, and uniformity, were e&s;pecially need|ful; and, therefore, the&s;e were the leading features of his character. With the&s;e re&s;pectable powers he entered, at an early period of life, on the career of military glory, again&s;t &s;avage invaders; and, even then, gave the mo&s;t deci&s;ive and honourable pre|&s;ages of his future greatne&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the year 1755 he &s;u&s;tained the rank of Colonel in the Virginia forces, being then only twenty-three years of age. In this rank he ac|companied Gen. Braddock in the celebrated expedition in which that officer was defeated and lo&s;t his life. On this occa&s;ion he was expo&s;ed to imminent danger, and di&s;played great bravery and military &s;kill. It is &s;aid to have been owing, humanly &s;peaking, to his advice not being fol|lowed, that the dreadful cata&s;trophe took place. And when the Com|mander in Chief had fallen, it was chiefly by his addre&s;s and good con|duct that the broken remains of the army were brought off the field.</P><P>A few weeks &s;ub&s;equent to the above-mentioned event, the Rev <HI>Samuel Davies,</HI> afterwards Pre&s;ident of the College of New-Jer&s;ey, and then &s;ettled in Virginia, was called upon to preach before an indepen+dent company of volunteers, which had ju&s;t been rai&s;ed, and which was about to march again&s;t the &s;ame foe. In the cour&s;e of his &s;ermon he took notice, with approbation, of the martial ardour which his hearers di&s;covered; and, afterward, when the di&s;cour&s;e was printed, he added, in a note, the following remarkable words: "As an in&s;tance of this, I may point out to the public that heroic youth Col. WASHINGTON, whom I cannot but hope Providence has hitherto pre&s;erved in &s;o &s;ignal a man|ner, for &s;ome important &s;ervice to his country."</P></NOTE></P>

<P>To pre&s;ent an adequate view of the &s;ervices which he rendered his country during this arduous &s;truggle, would be to give, in detail, a principal part of the hi&s;tory of the revolution. His talents, as a military commander, were not &s;o much di&s;|played

by the number or the magnitude of the battles which he won, nor by "marching over thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands who had fallen by his victorious &s;word;" as by his addre&s;s, in making the mo&s;t of the feeble force which he led; by preventing the effu&s;ion of blood; by &s;kilful di|ver&s;ions and movements; by exhau&s;ting the &s;trength of his foes; by wi&s;e delay, and avoiding deci&s;ive actions, where they could only be hurtful; by con|cealing the weakne&s;s of his army, not only from his opponents, but from his own &s;oldiery them|&s;elves; and, finally, by availing him&s;elf, with ad|mirable di&s;cernment, of &s;ea&s;ons and opportunities to make an effectual impre&s;&s;ion on the enemy. The ra&s;h and unthinking, who e&s;timate the talents of a general only by the multitudes he has de&s;troyed, the cities he has &s;acked, and the extent of the de|va&s;tation which he has produced, may be ready to imagine that &s;uch a picture affords little evidence of a high military character.

But his pre-eminent &s;ervices in accompli&s;h|ing our glorious revolution, have been univer&s;ally acknowledged, and have long been the theme of wonder and eulogium in both hemi&s;pheres. Who was it that, under God, encouraged our &s;uffering army, rai&s;ed their drooping &s;pirits, and cemented their affections and their &s;trength, in the mo&s;t gloomy cri&s;es? Who was it that, by his prudence and his fortitude, eluded the &s;nares which were laid for his feeble bands, and conducted them, by unexpected means, to victory and glory?

There was a maje&s;ty, and, I will add, if the expre&s;&s;ion may be allowed, a magic in his pre&s;ence, which di&s;pelled fear, which in&s;pired confidence, and which commanded the veneration of enemies them&s;elves.</P>
<P>When the independence of his country was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, you &s;aw him, like Cincinnatus, retiring to his farm, and, with a magnanimity even greater than he had di&s;played in military atchievements, exchanging the character of the &s;oldier for that of the citizen. When the voice of his fellow-citizens again called him into public view, you &s;aw him, obedient to their command, quitting, a &s;econd time, his beloved retirement, and putting his &s;plen|did and untarni&s;hed reputation to hazard on the
<PB N="32" REF="037964_0031_100F9DF9D8484730">
field of political conflict. It is probable that, on the day when he accepted the chair of Pre&s;i|dent of the United States, no mortal ever had the applau&s;e and the admiration of &s;o large a por|tion of mankind &s;o unanimou&s;ly enli&s;ted in his favour.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the admini&s;tration of our de|parted Friend and Father, as a civil magi&s;trate, it is, perhaps, impo&s;&s;ible, at pre&s;ent, to make up an impartial opinion. The tendencies and effects of &s;ome of his mea&s;ures, po&s;terity only can fully ap|preciate. That there is le&s;s unanimity among his countrymen with re&s;pect to the&s;e, than with re&s;pect to his military &s;ervices, you need not to be inform|ed. It &s;hould always, however, be remembered, that he was called to the helm of &s;tate only a &s;hort time before the gathering of a &s;torm in the political world, which has &s;ubverted the works of ages, which &s;till &s;hakes Europe to its centre, and of which no one can e&s;timate the con&s;equences, or &s;ee the end. Many of the conjunctures in which it became his duty to decide, and to act, were emi|nently critical, arduous, and embarra&s;&s;ing. To explore the untried intere&s;ts of an infant empire, and to &s;elect the &s;afe&s;t connexions abroad, when the civilized world had, almo&s;t univer&s;ally, ri&s;en in arms, was &s;urely a ta&s;k of magnitude, of peril, and of doubt. Nor is it wonderful that, at &s;uch a period, the feelings and pa&s;&s;ions of his con&s;titu|ents &s;hould be tremblingly alive to the impre&s;&s;ion of public mea&s;ures; or that the human mind, weak
<PB N="33" REF="037964_0032_100F9DFCAE67F970">
fallible, and variou&s;ly modified as it is, &s;hould ru&s;h to oppo&s;ite conclu&s;ions. Recollections of this kind cannot fail to &s;often the a&s;perities of party, and to &s;ugge&s;t an apology, both for the mi&s;takes which have been imputed to the illu&s;trious Decea&s;ed, and for the warmth of many who differed from him in opinion. And it is plea&s;ing, and, in a high de|gree, honourable to his memory, to ob&s;erve, that, amid&s;t all the diver&s;ity of &s;entiment, and the col|li&s;ion of parties; amid&s;t all the mutual accu&s;ations of foreign influence and dome&s;tic corruption, which have, unhappily, agitated our country, his integ|rity has remained unimpeached and un&s;u&s;pected. Even tho&s;e who believe his political errors to have been mo&s;t numerous, have yet acknowledged, that they were the errors of a mind actuated by the pure&s;t motives, and pur&s;uing, with undeviating rectitude of intention, the public good.</P>
<P>Many of tho&s;e great men who have dazzled the world with the &s;plendour of their actions, and who commenced their cour&s;e with profe&s;&s;ions of un|bounded attachment to liberty, have &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity to u&s;urp power, and have proved the wor&s;t of tyrants. The hi&s;tory of a <HI>Cromwell</HI> is the hi&s;tory of many deceivers and fal&s;e patriots. But the MAN who&s;e memory we delight to honour was never liable to this charge. You never &s;aw him thru&s;t him&s;elf forward un&s;olicited to public view, nor court an admi&s;&s;ion to places of tru&s;t and authority. On the contrary, he was always brought forward by the unanimous and importunate voice
<PB N="34" REF="037964_0033_100F9E009053BFA0">
of a grateful people. He availed him&s;elf of no opportunity that was pre&s;ented to gratify ambition, or to promote his per&s;onal aggrandizement. He &s;eemed to hold the commi&s;&s;ions of his country for no other end than to do it good; and in&s;tantly &s;ur|rendered them, when the object for which they were conferred was accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Singular &s;ucce&s;s, and extended fame, have been too often found to make even &s;trong minds &s;elf-confident and vain-glorious. A &s;ucce&s;sful general of antiquity, in recounting his numerous victories, when he came to &s;peak of one di&s;tingui&s;hed above all the re&s;t, boa&s;ted, "In <HI>this,</HI> Fortune" (the imagin|ary deity to whom he had conceded &s;ome agency in the former in&s;tances) "had no &s;hare." The Hero of America furni&s;hed an example &s;o remarkably of an oppo&s;ite kind, that his magnanimity was not le&s;s di&s;played in his manner of bearing pro&s;perity, and receiving applau&s;e, than in accompli&s;hing the mo&s;t important enterprizes of his public life. Neither the &s;ucce&s;s of his great undertakings, nor the voice of univer&s;al prai&s;e, were found to dimini&s;h his digni|fied, retiring mode&s;ty, or to &s;educe him from the remembrance of human weakne&s;s. On the Provi|dence of God he took every opportunity of expre&s;|&s;ing a firm reliance; and to Divine goodne&s;s and aid he never failed of a&s;cribing the glory of every favourable event.</P>
<P>Of the various kinds of greatne&s;s to which hu|man beings a&s;pire, you have heard that moral he|roi&s;m is the mo&s;t worthy of our ambition. The
<PB N="35" REF="037964_0034_100F9E0219FB0810">
laurels which virtue be&s;tows are more precious than crowns and &s;ceptres. <HI>He that is &s;low to anger,</HI> &s;ays the wi&s;e man, <HI>is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his &s;pirit, than he that taketh a city.</HI> But how &s;eldom have the proud favourites of fame ap|peared to recognize or regard this truth! How often, perhaps it may be &s;aid, how generally, have the &s;plendid and commanding talents of great men been joined with degrading pa&s;&s;ions, and the meane&s;t vices! The ties of ju&s;tice, of benevolence, and of gratitude have been violated, for the &s;ake of accompli&s;hing their magnificent but &s;elfi&s;h plans. A decided exception to this general character is a rare phaenomenon in hi&s;tory. You have, doubtle&s;s, gone before me in making an application of the&s;e remarks. The patriotic citizen, to who&s;e memory we are paying this tribute of re&s;pect, furni&s;hed &s;uch an exception. His private deportment corre&s;pond|ed with the &s;plendour of his public reputation. Amid&s;t the din of arms, and the weighty cares of office, he was not unmindful of the virtues which became him as a man. His ear was ever open to the voice of humanity; and his attention to the various duties of &s;ocial and relative life was digni|fied and exemplary.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon for the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed heroes to end their lives in neglect and ob&s;curity, after a high career of celebrity and honour. To the long and humiliating catalogue of the evils at|tendant on old age, which moral and &s;atirical writers have given, we may generally add the diminution,

<BIBL>JOHNSON.</BIBL></NOTE> But from this ge|neral law our beloved and admired Hero was in a great mea&s;ure exempted. He retained the affec|tions of his countrymen, and the admiration of the world, to the end of life. He de&s;cended to the grave full of years, loaded with honours, and co|vered with glory. And though his mortal part is con&s;igned to the tomb, yet we have every day fre&s;h rea&s;on to believe that his reputation will live, and his name be pronounced with enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardour among di&s;tant generations.</P>
<P>Such was the MAN who&s;e death we this day de|plore. Citizens of America! let his memory be ever dear, and ever honoured among you. Tell to your children, and to your children's children, what great things God has accompli&s;hed, through him, for your country. Tell them of his love of liberty. Tell them of his long, faithful, and tri|umphant exertions to e&s;tabli&s;h her &s;tandard in our land. Tell them how he lived, and how he died; that, like him, &s;hould the voice of national danger again call, they may be ready to &s;tep forth in &s;up|port of their rights, and prove them&s;elves worthy of the de&s;cent which they boa&s;t.</P>
<P>And you, ye youths of America! behold the example which has been this day &s;et before you; and let a generous ambition fire your bo&s;oms. It
<PB N="37" REF="037964_0036_100F9E0757F7F0C8">
would be extravagant encomium to hold up our departed CHIEF to your view as an example ab&s;o|lutely perfect, or to repre&s;ent him as concentrating all po&s;&s;ible excellence in his character. Such in|di&s;criminate and exce&s;&s;ive prai&s;e, when applied to any mortal, however it may be intended, mu&s;t have the effect of &s;atire in di&s;gui&s;e. But he, un|doubtedly, left an example, &s;o unu&s;ually illu&s;|trious, as to furni&s;h a fit object for your a&s;piring imitation. Go then, beloved youths! learn of him to con&s;ecrate your talents to the public good. Learn of him to love freedom, the birthright of man, and to be always ready to &s;acrifice your lives in defence of your country's rights. Learn of him to maintain that &s;elf-command, dignity, and order of conduct, which are &s;o e&s;&s;ential to &s;ocial welfare. And, finally, learn of him to carry to the end of life, that con&s;i&s;tent and uniform attachment to principle, for which he was &s;o eminently di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.</P>
<P>And thou, ILLUSTRIOUS SHADE! father, friend, and benefactor, farewell! Ever will we cheri&s;h and honour thy memory. Thy virtues and thy &s;ervices &s;hall be remembered while gratitude has a place in our bo&s;oms, and while this land continues to be the abode of freemen, who know how to e&s;timate the value of that liberty, which has been purcha&s;ed and &s;ealed with blood. Over thy grave we promi&s;e, in dependence on the aid of Him who alone can give &s;trength, that we will never for&s;ake the principles for which thou ha&s;t fought, and
<PB N="38" REF="037964_0037_100F9E0A1771F018">
which animated thee to thy late&s;t hour. While we watch, with filial affection, around thy &s;leeping du&s;t, we will guard, with ever growing zeal, that fair political inheritance which was thy glory and thy joy.</P>
<P>Finally, my brethren, we learn from this &s;ub|ject, and from the &s;olemn di&s;pen&s;ation of Provi|dence which we have been contemplating, what is the end of all earthly greatne&s;s.
<Q><L>The paths of glory lead but to the grave.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GRAY.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>The admired hero, and the beloved &s;age, not|with&s;tanding all his greatne&s;s, mu&s;t, at length, lie down in the du&s;t. There, according to the high decree of heaven, the rich and the poor, the learned and the ignorant, the honoured and the de&s;pi&s;ed, mu&s;t become the common food of corruption and worms. Candidates for immortality! <HI>&s;o number your days, that you may apply your hearts unto wi&s;dom.</HI> What will it avail you to receive the applau&s;e of man, <HI>who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils,</HI> and to be loaded with tho&s;e honours which &s;oon fade away, if, after all, you have no inheritance &s;ecured beyond this little &s;pan of exi&s;tence? There is a kingdom which is <HI>not of this world,</HI> offered and &s;ecured to all the faithful di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. There is a glo|rious exaltation tendered to them, <HI>without money, and without price;</HI>&mdash;an exaltation in compari&s;on

with which the objects of earthly ambition are in&s;ignificant trifles. To this felicity and glory, then, let each of us a&s;pire. Let us &s;eek after re|conciliation with God, through the atonement of his dear Son; and a conformity to his image, by the power of the Holy Spirit. Let it be our highe&s;t ambition to <HI>be found of him at la&s;t in peace, without &s;pot, and blamele&s;s: that when He who is our life &s;hall appear, we al&s;o may appear, and live and reign with him in glory, forever and ever.</HI> AMEN!</P>
