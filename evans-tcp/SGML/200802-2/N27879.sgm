<HEAD>TAWNY RACHEL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>TAWNY Rachel was the wife of poaching Giles. There &s;eemed to be a con&s;piracy in Giles's whole family to maintain them&s;elves by tricks and pilfering. Regular la|bour and hone&s;t indu&s;try did not &s;uit their idle habits. They had a &s;ort of genius at finding out every unlaw|ful means to &s;upport a vagabond life. Rachel travelled the country with a ba&s;ket on her arm. She pretended to get her bread by &s;elling laces, cabbage nets, ballads and hi&s;tory books, and to buy old rags and rab|bit &s;kins. Many hone&s;t people trade
<PB N="4" REF="037144_0003_100C8395F7AF4B78">
in the&s;e things, and I am &s;ure I don't mean to &s;ay a word again&s;t hone&s;t people, let them trade in what they will. But Rachel only made this traffic a pretence for getting admit|tance into farmers' kitchens, in order to tell fortunes. She was continual|ly practi&s;ing on the credulity of &s;illy girls; and took advantage of their ig|norance to cheat and deceive them. Many an innocent &s;ervant has &s;he cau|&s;ed to be &s;u&s;pected of a robbery, while &s;he her&s;elf, perhaps, was in a league with the thief. Many a harm|le&s;s maid has &s;he brought to ruin by fir&s;t contriving plots and events, and then pretending to foretell them. She had not to be &s;ure, the power of foretel|ling things, becau&s;e &s;he had no pow|er of &s;eeing into futurity; but &s;he had the art &s;ometimes to bring them about according as &s;he had foretold them. So &s;he got that credit for her
<PB N="5" REF="037144_0004_100C8398C76B6618">
wi&s;dom which really belonged to her wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Rachel was al&s;o a famous interpre|ter of dreams, and could di&s;tingui&s;h exactly between the fate of any two per&s;ons who happened to have a mole on the right or the left cheek. She had a cunning way of getting her&s;elf off when any of her prophe|cies failed. When &s;he explained a dream according to the natural ap|pearance of things, and it did not come to pa&s;s; then &s;he would get out of that &s;crape by &s;aying, that "this &s;ort of dreams went by contraries." Now of two very oppo&s;ite things the chance always is that one of them may turn out to be true; &s;o in either ca&s;e &s;he kept up the cheat.</P>
<P>Rachel in one of her rambles &s;top|ped at the hou&s;e of Farmer Jenkins. She contrived to call when &s;he knew
<PB N="6" REF="037144_0005_100C94ACB6AF5808">
the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e was from home, which indeed was her u&s;ual way. She knocked at the door; the maids being out hay-making, Mrs. Jenkins went to open it her&s;elf. Rachel a&s;ked her if &s;he would plea&s;e to let her light her pipe? This was a common pre|tence, when &s;he could find no other way of getting into a hou&s;e. While &s;he was filling her pipe, &s;he looked at Mrs. Jenkins and &s;aid, &s;he could tell her &s;ome good fortune. The farmer's wife, who was a very inof|fen&s;ive, but a weak and &s;uper&s;titious woman, was curious to know what &s;he meant. Rachel then looked about very carefully, and &s;hutting the door with a my&s;terious air, a&s;ked her if &s;he was &s;ure nobody would hear hear them. This appearance of my|&s;tery was at once delightful and terri|fying to Mrs. Jenkins, who bid the cunning woman &s;peak out. "Then," &s;aid Rachel in a &s;olemn whi&s;per, "there
<PB N="7" REF="037144_0006_100C94AE462B9AE8">
is to my certain knowledge a pot of money hid under one of the &s;tones in your cellar." "Indeed," &s;aid Mrs. Jenkins, "it is impo&s;&s;ible, for now I think of it, I dreamt la&s;t night I was in pri&s;on for debt." "Did you in|deed?" &s;aid Rachel, "that is quite &s;urpri&s;ing. Did you dream before twelve o'clock or after?" "O it was this morning, ju&s;t before I awoke. "Then I am &s;ure it is true, for morn|ing dreams always go by contraries," cried Rachel. "How lucky it was you dreamt it &s;o late." "Mrs. Jenkins could hardly contain her joy, and a&s;k|ed how the money was to be come at." "There is but one way," &s;aid Rachel, "I mu&s;t go into the cellar. I know by my art under which &s;tone it lies, but I mu&s;t not tell." They then both went down into the cellar, but Rachel refu&s;ed to point at the &s;tone unle&s;s Mrs. Jenkins would put five pieces of gold into a ba&s;on and do
<PB N="8" REF="037144_0007_100C94AFECA0CE00">
as &s;he directed. The &s;imple woman in&s;tead of turning her out of doors for a cheat, did as &s;he was bid. She put the guineas into a ba&s;on which &s;he gave into Rachel's hand. Rachel &s;trewed &s;ome white powder over the gold, muttered &s;ome barbarous words, and pretended to perform the black art. She then told Mrs. Jenkins to put the ba&s;on quietly down within the cellar; telling her that if &s;he offered to look into it or even to &s;peak a word the charm would be broken. She al&s;o directed her to lock the cellar door, and on no pretence to open it in le&s;s than forty eight hours. "If," added &s;he, "you clo&s;ely follow the&s;e directions, then, by the power of my art, you will find the ba&s;on conveyed to the very &s;tone under which the mo|ney lies hid, and a fine trea&s;ure it will be." Mrs. Jenkins, who believed every word the woman &s;aid, did ex|actly as &s;he was told, and Rachel
<PB N="9" REF="037144_0008_100C94B307D5FF28">
took her leave with a hand&s;ome reward.</P>
<P>When farmer Jenkins came home he de&s;ired his wife to draw him a cup of cider; this &s;he put off doing &s;o long that he began to be di&s;plea&s;ed. At la&s;t &s;he begged he would drink a little beer in&s;tead. He in&s;i&s;ted on knowing the rea&s;on, and when at la&s;t he grow angry &s;he told him all that had pa&s;t; and owned that as the pot of gold happened to be in the cider cellar, &s;he dare not open the door, as &s;he was &s;ure it would break the charm. "And it would be a pity you know," &s;aid &s;he, "to lo&s;e a good fortune for the &s;ake of a draught of cider." The farmer, who was not &s;o ea&s;ily impo|&s;ed upon, &s;u&s;pected a trick. He de|manded the key, and went and open|ed the cellar door. He found the ba|&s;on, and in it five round pieces of tin covered with powder. Mrs. Jenkins
<PB N="10" REF="037144_0009_100C94B493748B88">
bur&s;t out a crying; but the farmer thought of nothing but of getting a warrant to apprehend the cunning woman. Indeed &s;he well proved her claim to that name, when &s;he in&s;i&s;ted that the cellar door might be kept locked till &s;he had time to get out of the reach of all pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Poor Sally Evans! I am &s;ure &s;he rued the day that ever &s;he li&s;tened to a fortune teller! Sally was as harm|le&s;s a girl as ever churned a pound of butter; But Sally was ignorant and &s;uper&s;titious. She delighted in dream-books, and had con&s;ulted all the cunning women in the country to tell her whether the two moles on her cheek denoted that &s;he was to have two hu&s;bands, or only two children. If &s;he picked up an old hor&s;e-&s;hoe going to church &s;he was &s;ure that would be a lucky week. She never made a black pudding
<PB N="11" REF="037144_0010_100C94B68774B8D0">
without borrowing one of the Par&s;on's old wigs to hang in the chimney, firmly believing there was no other means to pre&s;erve them from bur&s;ting. She would never go to-bed on Mid|&s;ummer eve without &s;ticking up in her room the well known plant called Mid&s;ummer-man, as the bending of the leaves to the right or to the left, did not fail to tell her whether Jacob, of whom we &s;hall &s;peak pre&s;ently, was true or fal&s;e. She would rather go five miles about than pa&s;s near a church-yard at night. Every &s;eventh year &s;he would not eat beans becau&s;e they grew downward in the pod, in|&s;tead of upward; and &s;he would rather have gone with her gown open than have taken a pin of an old woman, for fear of being bewitched. Poor Sally had &s;o many unlucky days in her calender, that a large portion of her time became of little u&s;e, becau&s;e on the&s;e days &s;he did not dare &s;et about
<PB N="12" REF="037144_0011_100C94B92C5209F0">
any new work. And &s;he would have refu&s;ed the be&s;t offer if it had been made to her on a Friday, which &s;he thought &s;o unlucky a day that &s;he often &s;aid what a pity it was that there were any Friday in the week! Sally had twenty pounds left her by her grandmother. She had long been courted by Jacob a &s;ober lad with whom &s;he lived fellow &s;ervant at a creditable farmer's. Hone&s;t Ja|cob, like his name&s;ake of old, thought it little to wait &s;even years to get this dam&s;el to wife, becau&s;e of the love he bore her, for Sally had pro|mi&s;ed to marry him when he could match her twenty pounds with a|nother.</P>
<P>Now there was one Robert, a ram|bling, idle young gardener, who in&s;tead of &s;itting down &s;teadily in one place, u&s;ed to roam about the country and do odd jobs where he
<PB N="13" REF="037144_0012_100C94BB1BBE0D00">
could get them. No one under&s;tood any thing about him, except that he was a down looking fellow who got his bread nobody knew how, and never had a penny in his pocket. Ro|bert, who was now in the neighbour|hood, happened to hear of Sally Evans and her twenty pounds. He conceived a longing de&s;ire for the lat|ter. So he went to his old friend Rachel, told her all he had heard of Sally, and promi&s;ed if &s;he could bring about a marriage between them, &s;he &s;hould go &s;hares in the money.</P>
<P>Rachel undertook the bu&s;ine&s;s. She &s;et off to the farm hou&s;e and fell to &s;inging one of her mo&s;t enti|cing &s;ongs ju&s;t under the dairy win|dow. Sally was &s;o &s;truck with the pretty tune, which was unhappily u&s;ed to &s;et off &s;ome very loo&s;e words, that &s;he jumped up, dropped the &s;kim|ming di&s;h into the cream and ran out
<PB N="14" REF="037144_0013_100C94BCA7D5A1C0">
to buy the &s;ong. While &s;he &s;tooped down to rummage the ba&s;ket for the&s;e &s;ongs which had the mo&s;t tragical pictures, for Sally had a tender heart and delighted in whatever was mourn|ful, Rachel looked &s;tedfa&s;tly in her face, and told her &s;he knew by her art that &s;he was born to good fortune, but advi&s;ed her not to throw her&s;elf away. "The&s;e two moles on your cheek," added &s;he, "&s;hew you are in &s;ome danger." "Do they denote hu&s;bands or children," cried Sally? &s;tarting up, and letting fall the &s;ong of the children in the wood; "Hu&s;|bands," muttered Rachel, "Alas! poor Jacob!" &s;aid Sally mournfully, "then he will die fir&s;t won't he?" "Mum for that," quoth the fortune-teller, "I will &s;ay no more." Sally was impatient, but the more curio&s;i|ty &s;he di&s;covered, the more my&s;tery Rachel affected. At la&s;t &s;he &s;aid, "if you will cro&s;s my hand with a piece
<PB N="15" REF="037144_0014_100C94BE9E885478">
of &s;ilver I will tell you your fortune. By the power of my art I can do this three ways; by cards, by the lines of your hand, and by turning a cup of tea-grounds: which will you have." O, all! all!" cried Sally, looking up with reverence to this &s;un-burnt oracle of wi&s;dom, who knew no le&s;s than three different ways of diving into the &s;ecrets of futurity. Alas! per&s;ons of better &s;en&s;e than Sally have been &s;o taken in; the more is the pity! The poor girl &s;aid &s;he would run up &s;tairs to her little box where &s;he kept her money tied up in a bit of an old glove, and would bring down a bright queen Ann's &s;ix-pence very crooked. "I am &s;ure," added &s;he, "it is a lucky one, for it cured me of a very bad ague la&s;t &s;pring, by only laying it nine nights under my pillow without &s;peaking a word. But then you mu&s;t know what gave the virtue to this &s;ix-pence was, that it had belonged to three
<PB N="16" REF="037144_0015_100C94C098EBA768">
young men of the name of John; I am &s;ure I had work enough to get it. But true it is, it certainly cured me. It mu&s;t be the &s;ix-pence you know, for I am &s;ure I did nothing el&s;e for my ague, except indeed taking &s;ome bitter &s;tuff every three hours which the doctor called bark. Indeed I lo&s;t my ague &s;oon after I took it, but I am &s;ure it was owing to the crook|ed &s;ix-pence and not to the bark. And &s;o, good woman, you may come in if you will, for there is not a &s;oul in the hou&s;e but me." This was the very thing Rachel wanted to know.</P>
<P>While Sally was above &s;tairs unty|ing her glove, Rachel &s;lipped into the parlour, took a &s;mall &s;ilver cup from the beaufet, and clapped it into her pocket. Sally ran down lamenting &s;he had lo&s;t her &s;ix-pence, which &s;he verily believed was owing to her ha|ving put it into a left glove, in&s;tead of
<PB N="17" REF="037144_0016_100C94C2E3FB9BE0">
a right one. Rachel comforted her by &s;aying that if &s;he gave her two plain ones in&s;tead, the charm would work ju&s;t as well. Simple Sally thought her&s;elf happy to be let off &s;o ea&s;ily&punc; never calculating that a &s;mooth &s;hil|ling was worth two crooked &s;ix-pences. But this &s;kill was a part of the black art in which Rachel excelled. She took the money and began to examine the lines of Sally's left hand. She bit her withered lip, &s;hook her head, and bade her poor dupe beware of a young man, who had black hair. "No indeed," cried Sally all in a fright, you mean black eyes, for our Jacob has got brown hair, 'tis his eyes that are black." "That is the very thing I was going to &s;ay," mut|tered Rachel, "I meant eyes though I &s;aid hair, for I know his hair is as brown as a che&s;nut, and his eyes as black as a &s;loe." "So they are &s;ure enough," cried Sally, "how in the
<PB N="18" REF="037144_0017_100C94C470177660">
world could you know that!" forget|ting that &s;he her&s;elf had ju&s;t told her &s;o. And it is thus that the&s;e hags pick out of the credulous all which they afterwards pretend to reveal to them. "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I know a pretty deal more than that," &s;aid Rachel, but you mu&s;t be aware of this man. "Why &s;o," cried Sally with great quickne&s;s, "Becau&s;e," an&s;wered Rachel, "you are <HI>fated</HI> to marry a man worth a hundred of him who has blue eyes, light hair, and a &s;toop in the &s;houl|ders." "No, indeed, but I can't," &s;aid Sally, "I have promi&s;ed Jacob, and Jacob I will marry." "You can|not child," returned Rachel, in a &s;o|lemn tone; "it is out of your power, you are fated to marry the grey eyes and light hair." "Nay, indeed," &s;aid Sally, &s;ighing deeply, "if I am fated, I mu&s;t; I know there is no re|&s;i&s;ting one's fate." This is a common cant with poor deluded girls, who are not aware that they them&s;elves make
<PB N="19" REF="037144_0018_100C94C603084E60">
their fate by their folly, and then com|plain there is no re&s;i&s;ting it.&mdash;"What can I do?" &s;aid Sally. "I will tell you that too," &s;aid Rachel. "You mu&s;t take a walk next Sunday afternoon to the church-yard, and the fir&s;t man you meet in a blue coat, with a large po&s;y of pinks and &s;outhern|wood in his bo&s;om, &s;itting on the church-yard wall, about &s;even o'clock, he will be the man." "Provided," &s;aid Sally, much di&s;turbed, "that he has grey eyes, and &s;toops." "O, to be &s;ure," &s;aid Rachel, "otherwi&s;e it is not the right man." "But if I &s;hould mi&s;take," &s;aid Sally, "for two men may happen to have a coat and eyes of the &s;ame colour?" "To pre|vent that," replied Rachel, "if it is the right man, the two fir&s;t letters of his name will be R. P. This man has got money beyond &s;ea." "O, I do not value his money," &s;aid Sally, with tears in her eyes, "for I love
<PB N="20" REF="037144_0019_100C94C8F0C5E6A0">
Jacob better than hou&s;e or land: but if I am fated to marry another, I can't help it. You know there is no &s;trug|gling again&s;t my fate,"</P>
<P>Poor Sally thought of nothing, and dreamt of nothing all the week but the blue coat and the grey eyes. She made a hundred blunders at her work. She put her rennet into the butter-pan, in&s;tead of the chee&s;e tub. She gave the curd to the hogs, and put the whey into the vats. She put her little knife out of her pocket for fear it &s;hould cut love, and would not &s;tay in the kitchen, if there was not an even number of people, le&s;t it &s;hould break the charm. She grew cold and my&s;terious in her be|haviour to faithful Jacob, whom &s;he truly loved. But the more &s;he thought of the fortune teller, the more &s;he was convinced that brown hair and black eyes were not what
<PB N="21" REF="037144_0020_100C94CAE66E41C0">
&s;he was fated to marry, and there fore though &s;he trembled to think it, Jacob could not be the man.</P>
<P>On Sunday &s;he was too unea&s;y to go to church; for poor Sally had never been taught that her being unea&s;y was only a fre&s;h rea&s;on why &s;he ought to go thither. She &s;pent the whole afternoon in her little garret, dre&s;&s;ing in all her be&s;t. Fir&s;t &s;he put on her red ribbon which &s;he bought at la&s;t Lammas fair: then &s;he recollected that red was an un|lucky colour, and changed it for a blue ribbon, tied in a true lovers knot; but &s;uddenly calling to mind that poor Jacob had bought this knot for her of a pedlar at the door, and that &s;he had promi&s;ed to wear it for his &s;ake, her heart &s;mote her, and &s;he laid it by, &s;ighing to think &s;he was not fated to marry the man who had given it to her.
<PB N="22" REF="037144_0021_100C94CC72B9F640">
When &s;he had looked at her&s;elf twenty times in the gla&s;s, for one vain action always brings on a|nother, &s;he &s;et off, trembling and quaking every &s;tep &s;he went. She walked eagerly towards the church|yard, not daring to look to the right or left, for fear &s;he &s;hould &s;py Ja|cob who would have offered to walk with her.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he came within &s;ight of the wall, &s;he &s;pied a man &s;itting upon it. Her heart beat violently. She looked again; but alas! the &s;tran|ger not only had on a black coat, but neither hair nor eyes an&s;wered the de&s;cription. She happened to ca&s;t her eyes on the church-clock, and found &s;he was two hours before her time. This was &s;ome comfort. She walked away and got rid of the two hours as well as &s;he could, pay|ing great attention as &s;he went
<PB N="23" REF="037144_0022_100C94CEC54B4150">
not to walk over any &s;traws which lay acro&s;s. While the clock was &s;tri|king &s;even, &s;he returned to the church|yard, and, O! the wonderful power of fortune-tellers? there &s;he &s;aw him! there &s;at the very man! his hair as light as flax, his eyes as blue as butter-milk, and his &s;houlders as round as a tub. Every tittle agreed, to the very no&s;egay in his wai&s;tcoat button-hole. At fir&s;t indeed &s;he thought it had been &s;weet brier, and, glad to catch at a &s;traw, whi&s;pered to her&s;elf, it is not he, and I &s;hall marry Jacob &s;till; but on looking again, &s;he &s;aw it was &s;outhernwood plain enough, and that all was over. The man acco&s;ted her with &s;ome non|&s;en&s;ical, but too acceptable compli|ments. Sally was naturally a mo|de&s;t girl, and but for Rachel's wick|ed arts, would not have talked with a &s;trange man: but how could &s;he re&s;i&s;t her fate you know? After a
<PB N="24" REF="037144_0023_100C94D0CA6CDE78">
little di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he a&s;ked him, with a trembling heart, what might be his name? "Robert Price at your &s;er|vice," was the an&s;wer. "Robert Price! that is R. P. as &s;ure as I am a|live, and the fortune-teller was a witch! It is all out! it is all out! O the wonderful art of fortune-tellers!"</P>
<P>The little &s;leep &s;he had that night was di&s;turbed with dreams of graves, and gho&s;ts, and funerals; but as they were morning dreams, &s;he knew tho&s;e went by contraries, and that a funeral denoted a wedding. Still a &s;igh would now and then heave, to think that in that wedding Jacob could have no part. Such of my readers as know the power which &s;uper&s;tition has over the weak and credulous mind, &s;carcely need be told, that poor Sally's unhappine&s;s was &s;oon com|pleated. She forgot all her vows to
<PB N="25" REF="037144_0024_100C94D2B4A93B50">
Jacob; &s;he at once for&s;ook an hone&s;t man whom &s;he loved, and con&s;ented to marry one of whom &s;he knew no|thing, from a ridiculous notion that &s;he was compelled to do &s;o by a decree which &s;he had it not in her power to re&s;i&s;t. She married this Robert Price, the &s;trange gardener, whom &s;he &s;oon found to be very worthle&s;s, and very much in debt. He had no &s;uch thing as "money beyond &s;ea," as the fortune teller had told her; but he had another wife there. He got immediate po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sally's 20&pound;. Rachel put in for her &s;hare, but he refu&s;ed to give her a farthing, and bid her get a|way or he would have her taken up on the vagrant act. He &s;oon ran away from Sally, leaving her to be|wail her own weakne&s;s; for it was that indeed, and not any irre&s;i&s;tible fate which had been the cau&s;e of her ruin. To compleat her mi&s;ery

<P>Rachel, whenever &s;he got near home u&s;ed to drop her trade of for|tune-teller, and only dealt in the wares of her ba&s;ket. Mr. Wil&s;on, the clergyman, found her one day dealing out &s;ome very wicked ballads to &s;ome childern. He went up with a view to give her a reprimand; but had no &s;ooner begun his exhortation than up came a con&s;table, followed by &s;everal people. "There &s;he is, that is the old witch who tricked my wife out of the five guineas," &s;aid one of them. "Do your office con&s;table, &s;eize that old hag. She may tell fortunes and find pots of gold in Taunton gaol, for

there &s;he will have nothing el&s;e to do?" This was that very farmer Jenkins, who&s;e wife had been cheat|ed by Rachel of the five guineas. He had taken pains to trace her to her own pari&s;h: he did not &s;o much value the lo&s;s of the money, but he thought it was a duty he owed the public to clear the country of &s;uch vermin. Mr. Wil&s;on immediately committed her. She took her trial at the next a&s;&s;izes, when &s;he was &s;en|tenced to a year's impri&s;onment. In the mean time the pawnbroker to whom &s;he had &s;old the cup, which &s;he had &s;tolen from poor Sally's ma&s;|ter, was impeached; and as the robbery was fully proved upon Rachel, &s;he was &s;entenced for this crime to Bo|tany Bay; and a happy day it was for the county of Somer&s;et, when &s;uch a nui&s;ance was &s;ent out of it.

<P>I have thought it my duty to print this little hi&s;tory as a kind warning to all you young men and maidens not to have any thing to &s;ay TO CHEATS, IMPOSTORS, CUNNING WOMEN, FORTUNE-TELLERS, CUNJUR|ERS, and INTERPRETERS OF DREAMS.&mdash;Li&s;ten to me, your true friend, when I a&s;&s;ure you that God never reveals to weak and wicked women tho&s;e &s;ecret de&s;igns of his providence, which no human wi&s;dom is able to fore&s;ee. To con&s;ult the&s;e fal&s;e oracles is not only fooli&s;h but &s;inful. It is fooli&s;h, becau&s;e they are them&s;elves as ignorant as tho&s;e whom they pretend to teach, and it is &s;inful, becau&s;e it is prying into that fu|turity which God, as kindly as wifely, hides from men. God indeed <HI>orders</HI> all things; but when you have a mind to do a fooli&s;h thing, do not fancy you are <HI>fated</HI> to do it. This is tempting Providence, and not tru&s;ting him. It is indeed, "charging God with folly."
<PB N="29" REF="037144_0028_100C94DA70003540">
Prudence is his gift, and you obey him better when you make u&s;e of prudence under the direction of prayer, than when you madly run into ruin, and think you are only &s;ubmitting to your fate. Never fancy that you are compelled to undo your&s;elf. Never believe that God conceals his will from a &s;ober Chri&s;tian who obeys his laws, and reveals it to a vagabond Gip&s;ey, who runs up and down breaking the laws, both of God and man. King Saul never con&s;ulted the witch till he had left off &s;erving God. The Bible will direct us what to do better than any conjurer, and no days are unlucky but tho&s;e which we make &s;o by our vanity, folly, and &s;in.</P>

<HEAD>THE PLUM CAKES; OR, THE FARMER and his THREE SONS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A FARMER who &s;ome wealth po&s;&s;e&s;t,</L>
<L>With three fine boys was al&s;o ble&s;t;</L>
<L>The lads were healthy, &s;tout, and young,</L>
<L>And neither wanted &s;en&s;e nor tongue&punc;</L>
<L>Tom, Will, and Jack, like other boys,</L>
<L>Lov'd tops and marbles, &s;ports and toys.</L>
<L>The father &s;couted that fal&s;e plan,</L>
<L>That money only makes the man;</L>
<L>But, to the be&s;t of his di&s;cerning,</L>
<L>Was bent on giving them good learning&punc;</L>
<L>He was a man of ob&s;ervation,</L>
<L>No &s;cholar, yet had penetration;</L>
<L>So with due care, a &s;chool he &s;ought,</L>
<L>Where his young &s;ons might well be taught.</L>
<L>Quoth he, "I know not which rehear&s;es</L>
<L>Mo&s;t properly his themes or ver&s;es,</L>
<L>Yet I can do a father's part,</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="037144_0030_100C94DDE8B324C8">
And &s;chool the temper, mind, and heart;</L>
<L>The natural bent of each I'll know,</L>
<L>And trifles be&s;t that bent may &s;how."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas ju&s;t before the clo&s;ing year,</L>
<L>When Chri&s;tmas holidays were near,</L>
<L>The farmer call'd to &s;ee his boys,</L>
<L>And a&s;k'd how each his time employs.</L>
<L>Quoth Will, "there's father, boys, with|out,</L>
<L>He's brought us &s;omething good no doubt."</L>
<L>The father &s;ees their merry faces.</L>
<L>With joy beholds them, and embraces.</L>
<L>" Come boys, of home you'll have your fill,"</L>
<L>" Yes Chri&s;tmas now is near," &s;ays Will,</L>
<L>" 'Tis ju&s;t twelve days&mdash;the&s;e notches &s;ee,</L>
<L>" My notches with the days agree."</L>
<L>" Well (&s;aid the fire,) again I'll come,</L>
<L>And gladly fetch my brave boys home.</L>
<L>You two the dappled mare &s;hall ride,</L>
<L>Jack mount the poney by his &s;ide:</L>
<L>Mean time, my lads, I've brought you here</L>
<L>No &s;mall provi&s;ion of good cheer.</L>
<L>Then from his pocket &s;trait he takes</L>
<L>A va&s;t profu&s;ion of plum cakes;</L>
<L>He counts them out, a plenteous &s;tore,</L>
<L>No boy &s;hall have or le&s;s or more;</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="037144_0031_100C94E06B75D2F0">
Twelve cakes he gives to each dear &s;on,</L>
<L>When each expected only one;</L>
<L>And then, with many a kind expre&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>He leaves them to their own di&s;cretion;</L>
<L>Re&s;olv'd to mark the u&s;e each made</L>
<L>Of what he to their hands convey'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The twelve days pa&s;t he comes once more,</L>
<L>And brings the hor&s;es to the door;</L>
<L>The boys with rapture &s;ee appear&punc;</L>
<L>The poney and the dappled mare;</L>
<L>Each moment now an hour they count,</L>
<L>And fla&s;h their whips and long to mount.</L>
<L>As with the boys his ride he takes,</L>
<L>He a&s;ks the hi&s;tory of the cakes.</L>
<L>Says Will, "dear father, life is &s;hort,</L>
<L>So I re&s;olv'd to make quick &s;port;</L>
<L>The cakes were all &s;o nice and &s;weet,</L>
<L>I thought I'd have one jolly treat,</L>
<L>Why &s;hould I balk, &s;aid I, my ta&s;te?</L>
<L>I'll make at once a hearty fea&s;t.</L>
<L>So, &s;nugly by my&s;elf I fed,</L>
<L>When every boy was gone to-bed;</L>
<L>I gorg'd them all both pa&s;te and plum,</L>
<L>And did not wa&s;te a &s;ingle crumb;</L>
<L>Indeed they made me, to my &s;orrow</L>
<L>As &s;ick as death upon the morrow;</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="037144_0032_100C94E29CA6EA48">
This made me mourn my rich repa&s;t,</L>
<L>And wi&s;h I had not fed &s;o fa&s;t."</L>
<L>Quoth Jack, "I was not &s;uch a dunce,</L>
<L>To eat my quantum up at once;</L>
<L>And tho' the boys all long'd to clutch 'em,</L>
<L>I would not let a creature touch 'em;</L>
<L>Nor tho' the whole were in my power,</L>
<L>Would I my&s;elf one cake devour;</L>
<L>Thanks to the u&s;e of keys and locks,</L>
<L>They're all now &s;nug within my box;</L>
<L>The mi&s;chief is, by hoarding long,</L>
<L>They're grown &s;o mouldy and &s;o &s;trong,</L>
<L>I find they won't be fit to eat,</L>
<L>And I have lo&s;t my father's treat."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Well Tom," the anxious parent cries,</L>
<L>How did you manage?" Tom replies,</L>
<L>"I &s;hun'd each wide extreme to take,</L>
<L>To glut my maw, or hoard my cake;</L>
<L>I thought each day its wants would have,</L>
<L>And appetite again might crave;</L>
<L>Twelve &s;chool-days &s;till my notches counted,</L>
<L>To twelve my father's cakes amounted;</L>
<L>In every day I took out one,</L>
<L>But never ate my cake alone;</L>
<L>With every needy boy I &s;har'd,</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="037144_0033_100C94E4275C62B0">
And more than half I always &s;par'd.</L>
<L>One every day 'twixt &s;elf and friend,</L>
<L>Has brought my dozen to an end;</L>
<L>My la&s;t remaining cake to-day</L>
<L>I would not touch, but gave away;</L>
<L>A boy was &s;ick, and &s;carce could eat,</L>
<L>To him it prov'd a welcome treat:</L>
<L>Jack call'd me &s;pendthrift, not to &s;ave,</L>
<L>Will dubb'd me fool becau&s;e I gave;</L>
<L>But when our la&s;t day came I &s;mil'd,</L>
<L>For Will's were gone and Jack's were &s;poil'd;</L>
<L>Not hoarding much, nor eating fa&s;t,</L>
<L>I &s;erv'd a needy friend at la&s;t."</L>
<L>The&s;e tales the father's thoughts employ;</L>
<L>" By the&s;e (&s;aid he) I know each boy:</L>
<L>Yet Jack, who hoarded what he had,</L>
<L>The world will call a frugal lad;</L>
<L>And &s;elfi&s;h gormandizing Will,</L>
<L>Will meet with friends and favourers &s;till.</L>
<L>While moderate Tom, &s;o wi&s;e and cool,</L>
<L>The mad and vain will deem a fool;</L>
<L>But I, his &s;ober plan approve,</L>
