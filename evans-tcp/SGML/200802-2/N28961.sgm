</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO the primitive chri&s;tians, to tho&s;e who heard the words of CHRIST him&s;elf, or who obeyed the in&s;pired dictates of his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the text refers. They de&s;cribe the effects which nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e from true and vital piety. The&s;e effects are, an attachment to the peculiar and important doctrines of the go&s;pel, a &s;pirit of conde|&s;cen&s;ion and benevolence to our fellow chri&s;tians and our fellow men, and a deep reverence for, as well as a punctual attendance upon, the ordinances of divine wor&s;hip. The&s;e are the genuine fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s, flowing &s;pontaneou&s;ly from a renewed and holy heart.</P>
<P>IN every age of the chri&s;tian church, its real members have de&s;erved and received the character given in the text. The word, the will, the precepts of CHRIST have always been dear to them, and en|gaged their attention and obedience. Tho&s;e who
<PB N="6" REF="038619_0004_1012A87418E07820">
are truly con&s;cientious cannot be ea&s;y when &s;acred truth is either denied or corrupted; neither will they be ea&s;y when they are "taught for doctrines the commandments of men," or are obliged to &s;ub|mit to ceremonies which they do not con&s;ider as authorized by the word of GOD.</P>
<P>IT was this noble and chri&s;tian &s;pirit which peo|pled with civilized and chri&s;tan inhabitants the wilds of New England. Our venerable ance&s;tors felt them&s;elves aggrieved in their native land. They were forbidden to practice the wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline which they deemed &s;criptural and important, and were obliged under heavy penalties to conform to &s;uch as they viewed in a different light. Now that the controver&s;y is mellowed by time, and mutual harmony has removed the roughne&s;s, which, for want of candor and more frequent communication, ad|hered to both parties, we are ready to wonder that &s;o much keenne&s;s &s;hould be di&s;covered, and &s;o great &s;acrifices made to what we e&s;teem matters compara|tively indifferent.&mdash;But it is not po&s;&s;ible for us to di&s;|cover the motives of men, and therefore we have no right to judge or condemn them. That the foun|ders of our churches were actuated by motives really con&s;cientious, we are certain: For, only to the claims, the &s;trong claims of con&s;cience, will men &s;acrifice their native country and their dome&s;tic happine&s;s, by emigrating to a foreign and inho&s;pita|ble &s;hore. They loved GOD, and "went after him into the wilderne&s;s." Here they e&s;tabli&s;hed a civil polity, the &s;pirit and energy of which remain to the pre&s;ent day. They e&s;tabli&s;hed literary and religious
<PB N="7" REF="038619_0005_1012A876F7BE2828">
in&s;titutions, which have been the great &s;ources of the freedom and happine&s;s of our country. They foun|ded churches which, "having obtained help of GOD, continue unto this day."</P>
<P>A GREAT degree of harmony prevailed in our Country, and between our Churches, for many years. It was &s;ometimes interrupted indeed by &s;ec|taries who in&s;erted them&s;elves among us, and endeav|ored to e&s;tabli&s;h tenets of doctrine and di&s;cipline, which would have overthrown all civil government; &s;pread anarchy and confu&s;ion over the face of the new &s;ettlement, and would probably in the i&s;&s;ue have defeated the de&s;igns of the original emigrants. The principles of &s;elf defence led to mea&s;ures, which under other circum&s;tances, might not have been ju&s;|tifiable. The intruders were bani&s;hed from the ter|ritory, and &s;ome were more heavily puni&s;hed. Our fathers had purcha&s;ed an a&s;ylum for them&s;elves, an abode where they could hold their own &s;entiments and practice their own modes. They &s;uppo&s;ed therefore that they had a right to enjoy this liberty in quiet. They &s;uppo&s;ed that tho&s;e who differed from them had no right to invade the wilderne&s;s they had &s;ubdued or to interrupt their tranquillity, but ought to find &s;ome other place where they might wor&s;hip in peace in their own way without di&s;turb|ing their neighbors.</P>
<P>AMONG the Churches of New England, that which I now addre&s;s has always held an honorable place. One hundred years were, the la&s;t week, compleated, &s;ince the re&s;pectable founders of this in|&s;titution fir&s;t a&s;&s;embled publicly for the wor&s;hip of
<PB N="8" REF="038619_0006_1012A8788AB84B10">
GOD upon the very &s;pot which we now cover. This circum&s;tance has led my thoughts to the &s;ubject be|fore us, and induced me to attempt giving you a brief &s;ummary of the affairs of this Church from its fir&s;t &s;ettlement to the pre&s;ent day, and to &s;ugge&s;t to your minds and my own, &s;uch reflections as may make us wi&s;er and better.</P>
<P>A NUMBER of good men, di&s;tingui&s;hed for their liberality of thinking, as well as for their regard to the go&s;pel and its ordinances, laid the foundation of this church. While they re&s;pected the religious practices of the day, they thought that in &s;ome re|&s;pects they might be improved. The country had then been &s;ettled &s;eventy years, and in this period very little alteration had taken place in doctrine, di&s;ci|pline or manners. As to the doctrines of religion, the&s;e good men did not profe&s;&s;edly differ from their brethren of other churches. In a manife&s;to, pub|li&s;hed with a view to make known their purpo&s;es in the undertaking before them, they thus expre&s;s them&s;elves on this point, "We approve and &s;ub|&s;cribe the confe&s;&s;ion of faith put forth by the a&s;&s;em|bly of divines at We&s;tmin&s;ter. We de&s;ign only the true and pure wor&s;hip of GOD according to the rules appearing plainly to us in his word."</P>
<P>BUT in &s;everal re&s;pects they differed from other churches as to modes of order and di&s;cipline. In wor&s;hip they differed from them as to reading the &s;criptures and the u&s;e of the LORD's prayer in pub|lic. To the fir&s;t of the&s;e practices it was objected, that the &s;criptures could not be under&s;tood fully without an expo&s;ition, and that unlearned and un|&s;table
<PB N="9" REF="038619_0007_1012A87B98F85580">
men would be apt to wre&s;t them to their own de&s;truction. In reply to this, our founders ju&s;tified their conduct by &s;aying, that this objection would operate equally again&s;t reading the &s;criptures in pri|vate, becau&s;e they might be thus abu&s;ed, and thus the practice of the church of Rome in withholding the &s;criptures from the people would be ju&s;tified; that the word of GOD could not be injurious to tho&s;e who honored and obeyed it, and that many ought not to be deprived of a privilege becau&s;e a few might abu&s;e it; that we &s;hould hear the lan|guage of GOD him&s;elf, and then exerci&s;e our own judgment (not that of any earthly teacher) in deter|mining its true meaning; and that it was doing honor to the &s;criptures to have them read (agreeably to the practice of the primitive church) in their pure unadulterated &s;tate, during the public wor&s;hip of GOD.</P>
<P>THE ancient di&s;&s;enters did not approve the frequent u&s;e of the LORD's prayer in the liturgy of the church of England. They &s;tiled this a vain repetition. Their &s;eparation made them wi&s;h to keep as far as po&s;&s;ible from the cu&s;toms of the parent church, and they accordingly &s;eldom or ever u&s;ed this excellent form. The founders of this church avoided both extremes. They concluded to have this conci&s;e and comprehen&s;ive prayer u&s;ed once in each &s;ea&s;on of public wor&s;hip. The practice has been invariable to the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>THE admi&s;&s;ion to full communion was ju&s;tly deemed, by the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this country, a mat|ter of great importance. The general opinion was, that none &s;hould partake of this privilege but &s;uch
<PB N="10" REF="038619_0008_1012A87E7818D318">
as were truly born of GOD. In order that the church might judge of this fact, a relation of his chri&s;tian experiences, either written or oral, was re|quired of every candidate for this privilege. This u&s;age had degenerated into a matter of mere form, and &s;uch a &s;imilarity prevailed in the&s;e in&s;truments, as gave too much occa&s;ion for ridicule. In this church therefore the practice was di&s;u&s;ed. At lea&s;t it was not required, while every one was left at lib|erty to do it, which, however, has never in a &s;ingle in&s;tance been improved. They required that the pa&s;tor or pa&s;tors &s;hould be &s;atisfied as to the qualifi|cations of tho&s;e who offered them&s;elves to bapti&s;m or the communion, and this &s;atisfaction, properly expre&s;&s;ed, they con&s;idered as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for admi&s;&s;ion, without a formal vote of the church.</P>
<P>"We apprehend (&s;ays the manife&s;to before men|tioned) that a particular church, as &s;uch, is a &s;ociety of chri&s;tians by mutual agreement u&s;ually meeting together for public wor&s;hip in the &s;ame place and under the &s;ame mini&s;try, attending on the ordinances of GOD there. Under this principle we have never been in the habit of requiring or giving di&s;mi&s;&s;ions from or to other churches. If any per&s;on &s;tatedly congregates or communicates with us, we con&s;ider him as a member of our church, and admit him to all chri&s;tian privileges. At the &s;ame time we view him as &s;ubject to chri&s;tian di&s;cipline from us in ca&s;e of offence."&mdash;So liberal has the &s;pirit of this church always been as that its arms have been opened to re|ceive chri&s;tians of all prote&s;tant &s;ects and denomina|tions,
<PB N="11" REF="038619_0009_1012A882AFB159C0">
and admit them to the &s;ame privileges as they enjoyed in their own communities.</P>
<P>IN ancient days the choice of a mini&s;ter (as well as the choice of all civil officers) was confined to tho&s;e who were in full communion with the church. In this re&s;pect al&s;o our original con&s;titution differed from the general practice. "We cannot, &s;ays the manife&s;to, confine the right of choo&s;ing a mini&s;ter to the communicants alone, but we think that every baptized adult per&s;on, who contributes to the main|tenance, &s;hould have a vote in electing." This principle, founded in &s;trict ju&s;tice and rea&s;on, has been invariably practiced upon ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>So proper and nece&s;&s;ary do the&s;e alterations ap|pear to us, and &s;o generally are they adopted at the pre&s;ent day, as that we wonder any per&s;on &s;hould oppo&s;e them. But there were many men, &s;ome from a reverence to ancient in&s;titutions, and a con|viction of their propriety, &s;ome from dread of inno|vation, and others from a fear that this new and popular &s;ociety would dimini&s;h their own &s;ocieties and le&s;&s;en the influence they held; who exclaimed loudly again&s;t this new e&s;tabli&s;hment. Re&s;pectable and opulent as were the men who formed it, they found it difficult for a time to &s;tem the torrent of public opinion which ran &s;trongly again&s;t them, and overcome the jealou&s;y which their neighbors felt of being eclip&s;ed by them.</P>
<P>UNDER the&s;e circum&s;tances, it was nece&s;&s;ary for them to choo&s;e a mini&s;ter who agreed with them in &s;entiment; who had a liberal mind, and who had firmne&s;s enough to &s;upport his own opinions in the
<PB N="12" REF="038619_0010_1012A884432DC438">
face of prejudice and pa&s;&s;ion. Such a one they found in Mr. BENJAMIN COLMAN, a young man born in their own town, educated at their own col|lege, but who, by a re&s;idence of four years in Eng|land, had overcome local prejudices; and was rea|dy to pur&s;ue a mode of church wor&s;hip and di&s;|cipline &s;imilar to that of the di&s;&s;enting churches in England; among whom he had been an u&s;eful and acceptable preacher.&mdash;From an apprehen&s;ion that he might meet with difficulty in procuring an ordi|nation here, they reque&s;ted him to a&s;k it of the mini&s;|ters in London, who readily granted his de&s;ire, and by prayer, with the laying on of the hands of the pre&s;bytery, he was &s;eparated to the work of the mini&s;try, Augu&s;t 4, 1699.</P>
<P>THE church continued to flouri&s;h under the min|i&s;try of this excellent man for many years. Not long after his &s;ettlement, a propo&s;ition was made to join with him in the pa&s;toral office a Mr. ELIPHA|LET ADAMS. He preached to the &s;ociety under this idea for two years and an half. This propo&s;i|tion did not &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>THE commencement of our intimate connexion with the fir&s;t church in this town was in the year 1711. In con&s;equence of the de&s;truction of their meeting-hou&s;e by fire, they a&s;&s;embled here for a year and an half, when their pre&s;ent edifice was compleated. This connexion was cemented by our being united in the lecture preparatory to the &s;acra|ment. The latter union took place in the month of March, 1720. The happine&s;s and edification of both &s;ocieties have been greatly promoted by this
<PB N="13" REF="038619_0011_1012A8877994B130">
mea&s;ure. We have felt our&s;elves to be in a &s;en&s;e one. And when either of us have needed accom|modation, in con&s;equence of repairing or rebuilding our re&s;pective places of wor&s;hip, we have always found it with each other.</P>
<P>THE prejudices or rather ta&s;te of the age may be found from ob&s;erving the refu&s;al of the &s;ociety to ac|cept an organ bequeathed them by THOMAS BRAT|TLE, E&s;q. who was their principal benefactor,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since that period there have been many large donations made to the &s;ociety by its affluent and re&s;pectable members. It would be dif|ficult to particularize all the&s;e. It is but ju&s;tice however to remark, that the late Governor HANCOCK was the greate&s;t benefactor the &s;o|ciety ever had. He gave the bell and a pulpit made of mahogany, and curiou&s;ly carved, be&s;ides a very hand&s;ome &s;ub&s;cription in money, at the time of rebuilding the meeting-hou&s;e. He pre&s;ented us al&s;o with an elegant folio bible to be read in public. He &s;ub&s;cribed very large|ly, and more than any individual, towards the expen&s;e of purcha&s;ing the pre&s;ent organ. The late Governor BOWDOIN al&s;o, with his fami|ly and connexions, have been great benefactors to the &s;ociety.</NOTE> and in a &s;en&s;e their founder. This took place in the year 1713, when they voted, "that they did not think proper to u&s;e the &s;ame in the public wor&s;hip of GOD."</P>
<P>Aug. 16, 1715, Mr. WILLIAM COOPER was cal|led to the pa&s;toral office in connexion with Dr. COL|MAN. His youth and his mode&s;ty led him to beg, that his actual &s;eparation to the work of the mini&s;try might be delayed as long as po&s;&s;ible. With a re|que&s;t, which did Mr. COOPER &s;o much honor, the church complied, and he was not ordained till May, 1716.</P>
<P>WITH two pa&s;tors di&s;tingui&s;hed for their literary and mini&s;terial qualifications; both warmly engaged in the &s;ervice of their ma&s;ter, and united in their
<PB N="14" REF="038619_0012_1012A88C0264B390">
&s;entiments, their exertions and their ardent zeal, the &s;ociety increa&s;ed from year to year in numbers and re&s;pectability. Many "were added to the church of &s;uch as, we tru&s;t, are &s;aved," and the candle of the LORD &s;hone brightly on our tabernacle.</P>
<P>No cloud intervened to dimini&s;h this brightne&s;s till the month of December, 1743, when Mr. COOP|ER was &s;uddenly &s;natched from the arms of his fami|ly and flock, and tran&s;lated to a better world. Could the warme&s;t affection, the highe&s;t e&s;teem, the mo&s;t fervent prayers of his people poured out in &s;ecret, in the family and in the church of GOD, have pro|tracted his life, it would not have been taken away. But the will of GOD was done, and he fell in the mid&s;t of his days and u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT this heavy lo&s;s was compen&s;ated by the ap|pearance of his &s;on, the late excellent Dr. COOPER, in the &s;acred de&s;k. In this place he commenced and terminated his mini&s;terial labors. His mild and gen|tle manners, his delicate ta&s;te, his brilliant talents for the &s;ervices and devotions of the pulpit, as well as their regard to the memory of his father, fixed the eyes of this people upon him. Within a very few weeks they called him to office. Having di&s;|covered the &s;ame mode&s;ty and made the &s;ame delay as his father had done in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, he was ordained on the twenty-fir&s;t of May, 1746.</P>
<P>THIS event was &s;ucceeded by one of a very dif|ferent nature. On Aug. 29, 1747, the venerable Dr. COLMAN died &s;uddenly! This great and good man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a capacious mind, a &s;trong inclination for what is called belle lettre, as well as more &s;erious
<PB N="15" REF="038619_0013_1012A88D914C0A20">
learning, a natural politene&s;s, and an ea&s;y dignity of manners which commanded re&s;pect and conciliated e&s;teem. His foreign corre&s;pondence was exten&s;ive, and his influence was always exerted to &s;erve our college and his country.</P>
<P>No propo&s;al has &s;ince been made to have more than one pa&s;tor at a time in the church. The late Dr. COOPER, by his exemplary life, his elegant di&s;|cour&s;es, his fervent prayers, his patriotic &s;ervices, and his graceful manners, acquired a very high reputation at home and abroad.&mdash;No remarkable event took place during the cour&s;e of his mini&s;try, excepting an alteration in the ver&s;ion of the p&s;alms and the demo|lition of our ancient place of wor&s;hip, with the erection of the pre&s;ent elegant and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This building co&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</NOTE> co&s;tly edifice, in which public wor&s;hip was fir&s;t celebrated July 25, 1773.</P>
<P>For thirty-&s;even years, in the cour&s;e of which term our trying and di&s;tre&s;sful but glorious revolu|tion began and was completed, Dr. COOPER contin|ued the beloved, the u&s;eful and &s;ucce&s;sful pa&s;tor of this church. But death, with inexorable hand, ar|re&s;ted him in the zenith of his popularity and ac|ceptance, Dec. 29, 1783. Few men have lived more e&s;teemed, or died more lamented.</P>
<P>ON Jan. 12, 1785, I received the pa&s;toral charge of this church. With the events which led to and &s;ucceeded this &s;olemn tran&s;action you are all ac|quainted. With truth I can &s;ay, that you have done all which affection could dictate or bounty be&s;tow, to render my life ea&s;y and re&s;pectable. That I have been &s;o little u&s;eful to you and your children, has
<PB N="16" REF="038619_0014_1012A890779F3260">
been my con&s;tant burden. But may we yet &s;ee bet|ter days on this account; And may my life and my u&s;efulne&s;s terminate together!</P>
<P>As an evidence of the change of public opinion, I ob&s;erve that the grand and melodious organ, which now a&s;&s;i&s;ts our pla&s;mody and devotions, was opened for the fir&s;t time on the 17th day of June, 1792. That, which eighty years before was rejected when offered freely, was then procured at a great expen&s;e.</P>
<P>IT has been the honor and felicity of this church that its union has never been interrupted. In all &s;ocieties there will of cour&s;e be men who have an attachment to their own opinions. In this &s;ociety, the gentlene&s;s of manners, the candor, conde&s;cen|&s;ion and brotherly love, which are the ornament and the band of religious a&s;&s;ociations, have conciliated the affection and quieted the minds of tho&s;e who have thought differently from the majority. "No root of bitterne&s;s has &s;prung up among us." The love of peace and harmony has ever prevailed, and we have a fair pro&s;pect of continuing a happy &s;o|ciety.</P>
<P>AND now, my brethren, be thankful to GOD, who has &s;o remarkably &s;miled upon your predece&s;&s;ors and your&s;elves even to this day. "The vineyard which his own right hand planted," has flouri&s;hed and increa&s;ed for one hundred years. No furious bla&s;t has overthrown it. No in&s;idious enemy has undermined or extirpated it. We behold it this day flouri&s;hing in its original beauty, and bringing forth, we tru&s;t, the clu&s;ters of Canaan," good fruit unto GOD. It is our hearts de&s;ire and prayer to
<PB N="17" REF="038619_0015_1012A8920D610C80">
GOD, "that a pure and a &s;piritual church may be continued here &s;o long as the &s;un and the moon &s;hall endure. When we &s;hall be gathered to the du&s;t of our fathers, and the "places" which now know us &s;hall know us no more, may a generation ri&s;e up which &s;hall love GOD more, and &s;erve him better than ever <HI>we</HI> have done. May the members of this church be more exemplary, and its mini&s;ters more u&s;eful, through all &s;ucceeding ages! May it flouri&s;h with the vigor of youth and the wi&s;dom of age, till the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation &s;hall be compleated, and the church univer&s;al &s;hall be tran&s;lated from earth to heaven!</P>
<P>LET us reflect with delight and reverence on the immutability of GOD! The men and the things of time pa&s;s rapidly away, but he abideth "the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to day and forever!" Although we may not "put our tru&s;t in princes nor in the &s;ons of men, for their breath goeth forth and they al&s;o are vani|ty," yet we may &s;afely rely on the wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s of the ruler of the univer&s;e! To his Son, our Saviour, we may &s;afely confide our immortal inter|tere&s;ts; and in his univer&s;al government we may al|ways rejoice, for the judge of all the earth will do right!</P>
<P>How &s;wiftly, my brethren, does time pa&s;s away! Another year, and a full century &s;ince the in&s;titu|tion of our religious &s;ociety, have now elap&s;ed! E|vents, the mo&s;t important to our country and the world, have taken place in it! Some of us have wit|ne&s;&s;ed the&s;e &s;cenes, and others have lived many years of this century! Let us all make a &s;olemn pau&s;e, and inquire what is our &s;tate and condition!

Have we improved our time and our talents, and what is the foundation of our hope towards GOD! We may never witne&s;s the clo&s;e of another year; and there is not the mo&s;t di&s;tant probability, (I had almo&s;t &s;aid po&s;&s;ibility) that any one of us will &s;ee the end of another century! There is no hazard in pre|dicting that, before another hundred years revolve over this church, every one of us, of every age and de&s;cription, will be numbered with the dead, and gone to our account! Where &s;hall we then be? In happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, in heaven or in hell? How &s;hall we appear before the judgment &s;eat of CHRIST, and what will be our &s;entence at the la&s;t day? The&s;e are &s;olemn que&s;tions. They relate to our &s;ouls and eternity. They require &s;erious examina|tion, and deliberate an&s;wers. Let us this day "think on our ways, and turn our feet unto GOD's te&s;timo|nies. Let us make ha&s;te, and not delay to keep his commandments."</P>
<P>"OUR fathers, where are they, and the prophets, do they live forever?" The men, who once wor&s;hip|ed on this very &s;pot, are "gone the way of all the earth," and their bones are now mouldering to du&s;t in the dark and &s;ilent grave! Soon &s;hall we follow them, and have no more &s;hare in any thing that is done under the &s;un! May GOD prepare us for this &s;olemn hour! May GOD enable us to "&s;erve him and our generation according to his will! And may we &s;o wor&s;hip him in his courts below as that we may be prepared to &s;erve him, with perfect puri|ty and happine&s;s, in his temple above!</P>
