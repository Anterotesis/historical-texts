<P>THE natal day of the FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY has once more occurred; but it no longer brings with it the wonted joy and fe&s;tivi|ty of the &s;ea&s;on. The harps are hung upon the weeping willows; the cheerful &s;ong converted into a &s;olemn dirge. Death, by a &s;udden and awful &s;troke, has deprived our nation of its beau|ty and glory, and the world of its greate&s;t or|nament. Prompted by our own feelings, and a conviction of duty,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See note (A) in the Appendix.</HI></NOTE> we delayed not to lament the eventful cri&s;is of human frailty, by &s;uitable tokens and expre&s;&s;ions of &s;en&s;ibility and &s;orrow. Our temples were &s;hrouded in black, and our pulpits were vocal in his prai&s;e. Our nation this day a&s;&s;embles, in obedience to the procla|mation
<PB N="6" REF="037627_0004_100EEED1F91C6450">
of his com-patriot, our illu&s;trious Pre&s;i|dent, to pay, in uni&s;on, the la&s;t public office of mournful re&s;pect to the memory of the man &s;he delighted to honour. In I&s;rael thirty days of ince&s;&s;ant mourning were &s;olemnly pa&s;&s;ed on the death of Mo&s;es, their lawgiver and leader; and we are told, that in Rome, badges of mourn|ing were worn<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See note (B) in the Appendix.</HI></NOTE> a whole year after the death of &s;ome of their favourite chieftains. The event we have this day a&s;&s;embled to deplore is not merely a death&mdash;it is the departure of a WASH|INGTON! The tear of affection and gratitude &s;pontaneou&s;ly flows. The involuntary &s;igh heaves the patriot brea&s;t, and pours the full tide of grief at the urn of its father and friend: and in &s;uch grief there is a luxury unknown to fordid minds.</P>
<P>PATRIOTISM mourns the lo&s;s of her fir&s;t-born &s;on. Our country laments the lo&s;s of &s;o much amiablene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition and character&mdash;of &s;o much might and valour, which gave &s;trength and &s;tability to the &s;tate. But let us not lo&s;e in unavailing &s;orrow the rational and moral im|provement to be derived from &s;o afflictive a di&s;|pen&s;ation of Divine Providence.</P>
<P>To this end I have placed David at the head of this di&s;cour&s;e, bewailing the fall of Saul and Jonathan.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037627_0005_100EEED3889451D0">
IT will not be nece&s;&s;ary to enquire into the connected narrative of tran&s;actions which pro|duced the event he &s;o deeply laments, and in &s;uch pathetic language calls on the people to memorize. "The beauty of I&s;rael is &s;lain; how are the mighty fallen!" and dwelling on the amiablene&s;s of the one, and the valour of the other, he exclaims again and again, "How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed!" The terms, "beauty" and "mighty," may be con&s;idered as expre&s;&s;ing the native good|ne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, and the amiable virtues of the life; great natural energy of mind; a genius ready at acquiring knowledge, and at di&s;cerning the fitte&s;t application of it; a &s;pirit bold, active and enterprizing; a mind capable of great and benevolent conceptions; a character formed by noble exertions and heroic deeds. To lament fallen greatne&s;s is but a natural expre&s;&s;ion of &s;ympathy at beholding the &s;plendid ruins of hu|man nature in her mo&s;t ennobled &s;ons; it is a dictate of philanthropy, con&s;idering the impor|tance of &s;uch characters to the happine&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>A FEW thoughts on the true dignity and ex|cellence of character will lead us to a ju&s;t e&s;ti|mation of its great worth and importance, and to an improved view of the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="037627_0006_100EEED5626B5EF0">
THE power and influence which characters, formed on the ba&s;is of real worth and excel|lence, give the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors over the community; the virtue and order which their example &s;heds through &s;ociety; the defence and protection which their exertions afford the &s;tate, render them pre-eminent ble&s;&s;ings to the world, and make them the ju&s;t objects of e&s;teem and vene|ration while living, and of &s;incere regret, but of grateful memory, when the Supreme Ruler of the world &s;ees fit to take them out of it. On the theatre of this world there is a field opened wide and exten&s;ive for the exerci&s;e of genius, and the exertion of all the powers of man, either in the cabinet of national councils, or in the field of national defence; in the advancement of &s;ci|ence and the arts, or in the improvements of civilized and &s;ecular life; be&s;ides the di&s;charge of the more private offices of friend&s;hip, and of dome&s;tic obligation.</P>
<P>As to the public and exten&s;ive &s;ervices to which men, formed by nature to high elevation of character, are called for the good of their country, we know, and the world knows, their great importance and u&s;efulne&s;s. Government, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, is nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of &s;ociety; and military &s;kill and prow|e&s;s, with "weapons of war," are requi&s;ite for
<PB N="9" REF="037627_0007_100EEED81A47D438">
the e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil rights, and defence of civil order. How happy that country, who&s;e de&s;tinies, requiring the wi&s;dom of patriotic poli|cy, and the energy of the intrepid warrior, gives birth to the paragon in whom both completely center! Highly as the circling &s;pheres ble&s;s the natural world, by the regular operation of their e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, does the union of the&s;e qualities reflect their ble&s;&s;ings on the political &s;y&s;tem. It con&s;titutes "the beauty" of our country, on ac|count of native excellence; and "the mighty," on account of pre-eminence of character among the great.</P>
<P>CIVIL in&s;titutions run parallel to the formation of &s;ociety. Neither a &s;en&s;e of religion, nor a perception of moral obligation, has been found &s;ufficiently powerful in any age, to pre&s;erve un|di&s;turbed peace at home; much le&s;s to check the encroaching &s;pirit of ambition or avarice from abroad. Hence ari&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity of re|&s;traines from civil law, to curb the licentious&punc; and unprincipled; and of military force for defence. Hence al&s;o the nece&s;&s;ity of great political and military talents, adapted to meet the exigencies of the times. Nor has Divine Providence been unmindful of this. But in every age it has rai&s;ed up tho&s;e who&s;e abilities enabled them to be emi|nently u&s;eful in their day. Mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ed na|tions
<PB N="10" REF="037627_0008_100EEED9DA4E2950">
have been favoured with &s;ome patriotic de|liverer. In I&s;rael a Mo&s;es was rai&s;ed up to de|liver, and a Jo&s;hua to lead the people; in Rome a Camillus; in Greece a Leonidas; in Sweden a Gu&s;tavus; and in England a Hampden, a Ru&s;&s;el, a Sydney. The&s;e were &s;ucce&s;sful in pre&s;erving and defending the &s;tate. But who of them, like a WASHINGTON, formed and e&s;tabli&s;hed an empire?</P>
<P>THE dignity of the human character does not con&s;i&s;t merely in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or exertion of great talents.</P>
<P>IT is not the adventitious circum&s;tance of ci|vil di&s;tinction, military honours, or opulent conditions, that gives a title to it. There are in|&s;tances, not a few, of commanding genius, of va&s;t mental re&s;ource, and of great and brilliant deeds, all &s;tained with the mo&s;t pe&s;tiferous crimes: a heart black as midnight darkne&s;s, with a head luminous as the midday &s;un. Deeds that would do honour to the greate&s;t, and actions that would di&s;grace the meane&s;t of men, &s;ometimes con&s;titute the mixed &s;hades of the &s;ame character. Can &s;uch an unhallowed mixture con&s;titute dignity or ex|cellence of character? Surely not. We may ad|mire the hero, but we de&s;pi&s;e the man.</P>
<P>TRUE worth and greatne&s;s of character is formed by the union of the head and heart act|ing
<PB N="11" REF="037627_0009_100EEEDC216FC0E0">
in concert; in upright principles, directing the judgment and controuling the &s;trong arm of power; in the fear of God, ever guiding to a due regard to man. Actuated by the&s;e principles, the character will not be &s;tained by the a&s;pirings of unhallowed ambition; but will gather beauty and lu&s;tre from opportunities for great and bene|volent actions; and the more the motives of ac|tion are examined, the more clo&s;ely the character is &s;canned, the fairer will they appear.</P>
<P>THE providence of God calls &s;ome men to act in high &s;tations, and the circum&s;tances of the public require all their energies, either to form or admini&s;ter government, or defend the &s;tate. The&s;e are like a city placed on a hill. The light of their example, or the blackne&s;s of their charac|ter, becomes con&s;picuous in proportion to their elevation; and every private &s;tation becomes a po&s;t of honour, when honourably filled. The ef|fects of example are great in a private &s;tation&mdash;more &s;o in the dome&s;tic &s;tate. How important then the duty, and how great the ble&s;&s;ings reflect|ed on &s;ociety, by the good and virtuous example of tho&s;e who are rendered eminent by high &s;ta|tions, and the atchievement of glorious deeds! Such &s;ervices are peculiarly graced, and derive &s;upreme worth from that excellence of character which perfumes the mo&s;t amiable, and adds lu&s;tre to the mo&s;t illu&s;trious. Not &s;o much could the

<P>WE are here reminded of a circum&s;tance that damps the u&s;ual joys of this day.</P>
<P>"THE beauty of I&s;rael is &s;lain; how are the mighty fallen!" No character &s;o good, no man &s;o great, but he mu&s;t fall by the hand of death. Pro&s;trate in the du&s;t all human glory mu&s;t be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aid. De&s;cended from the &s;ame original &s;tock, all mankind are de&s;tined to the &s;ame end. The &s;entence of&mdash;"<HI>Du&s;t to du&s;t</HI>"&mdash;is univer&s;al upon our race. In this warfare there is no di&s;charge; in the grave no di&s;tinction. In the repo&s;itory of the dead we behold a mixed multitude, of all ages, conditions and characters; the aged and the young, the rich and the poor, the hero and the coward, the public magi&s;trate and the private citi|zen, the pious chri&s;tian and the impious offender, who have promi&s;cuou&s;ly fallen before all-conquer|ing death. Such are the ravages death is con|&s;tantly making upon our race!</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="037627_0011_100EEEE024250D40">
THE truth of the&s;e ob&s;ervations is verified in the afflicting in&s;tance of the fall of the glory, &s;trength and boa&s;t of our country.</P>
<P>YES, the <HI>princely</HI> &s;oul of our beloved WASH|INGTON has taken its flight! He is no longer di&s;turbed by the concu&s;&s;ions of our jarring ele|ments. The heavens open wide their huge por|tals to receive his pure and ennobled &s;pirit; an|gels hail him welcome to his native &s;eat; the im|men&s;e temple of God becomes the place of his re&s;idence forever. He has cea&s;ed from his la|bours, but his works will long live. The in|&s;cription on the lofty marble will for a long time inform the inqui&s;itive traveller&mdash;<HI>Here lies the venerable chief</HI>&mdash;"<HI>Fir&s;t in war, fir&s;t in peace, and fir&s;t in the hearts of his countrymen.</HI>" The mo|numental in&s;cription &s;hall mouldering time ef|face; but his heroic and benevolent deeds are recorded on the tablet of the heart. While man lives, they will live; &s;o long as virtue has a name, they will be admired. Yea, his ju&s;tly ac|quired fame &s;hall &s;urvive the wreck of nature; and wreaths of glory crown his head, when time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;torian will attempt a di&s;play of his virtues by a detail of his great tran&s;actions; the poet will celebrate his name in poli&s;hed and har|monic periods; he will a&s;&s;emble the worthies of
<PB N="14" REF="037627_0012_100ED3966F8F1450">
ancient and modern times, and by all the arts of playful imagination faintly pourtray a WASHING|TON. The painter and the &s;culptor will employ all their art to eternize his noble form, and ma|je&s;tic mein, but can never fully expre&s;s the cha|ractere&s;tic virtues which were enthroned on his brow. The eulogi&s;t will rack his invention to be&s;tow merited panegyric on a character who&s;e depth it cannot fathom&mdash;language will refu&s;e her aid, and eulogy it&s;elf grow faint upon his tongue.</P>
<P>BUT to record his virtues in our hearts, and tran&s;mit his name, with veneration, to your children, is the claim of gratitude; and by rai&s;ing a &s;pirit of emulation, may be u&s;eful.</P>
<P>EVERY thing re&s;pecting this illu&s;trious man is now become important. The very name of WASHINGTON is dear to us. The highe&s;t eulo|gium we could po&s;&s;ibly be&s;tow, would be a cor|rect account of his life and tran&s;actions. Here again we mu&s;t fail, and &s;atisfy our&s;elves with a few of the outlines of a portrait which, if filled up with plain facts, would pre&s;ent it in a tran&s;cend|ent attitude.&mdash;General WASHINGTON was born of re&s;pectable parents, in Virginia, on the twenty-&s;econd day of February, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and thirty-two. His education was not in the academic forums; but his native powers,
<PB N="15" REF="037627_0013_100EEEE4F1F15AC8">
improved by clo&s;e application under a private tutor, &s;oon gave him a re&s;pectable &s;tation among the arts and &s;ciences; and univer&s;ities of the fir&s;t rank in Europe and America have long deemed it an honour to have his name enrolled in their li&s;t of literary titles. Indeed, his letters and other compo&s;itions, both political and military, afford the be&s;t comment on his literary acquirements. He appears to have early imbibed the principles of religion. That he was nurtured in the habits of virtue, appears from their attending him through all the public and private walks of life. He never lo&s;t the re&s;pect of the &s;on,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See note (D) in the Appendix.</HI></NOTE> in the eleva|tion of the commander in chief. Nor did patri|oti&s;m dimini&s;h his connubial and dome&s;tic affec|tion. Amiable in the di&s;charge of the&s;e duties, he never for a moment lo&s;t &s;ight of tho&s;e ties that conferred the obligation upon him.</P>
<P>EARLY habits of a virtuous tendency, an ear|ly acquaintance with the principles of religion, and the exerci&s;es of piety, form the &s;tronge&s;t bar|riers again&s;t vice in youth. They lay the &s;ure&s;t foundation for honour and u&s;efulne&s;s in life, re&s;pect in age, and comfort in death. A life com|menced with &s;uch principles and habits, a youth of &s;uch &s;obriety, fidelity and filial re&s;pect, indi|cates a character to be di&s;tingui&s;hed afterwards by worthy deeds; a career of glory, &s;upported and adorned by moral excellence, which &s;hall
<PB N="16" REF="037627_0014_100EEEE678C658F8">
end in an age of tranquility and comfort. In this in&s;tance we are not di&s;appointed. We behold the happy clo&s;e of a life, which had been render|ed glorious by the union of virtue and talents, &s;hining with undimini&s;hed lu&s;tre. In whom has the virtue of the youth, the magnanimity of the &s;oldier, the pure zeal of the patriot and the chri&s;|tian, ever appeared with &s;o much grace and dig|nity, as in him to whom we this day wi&s;h to a&s;&s;ign a ju&s;t tribute of re&s;pect?</P>
<P>IN a &s;ound body dwelt a &s;ounder mind; the latter improved by clo&s;e application in youth; the former by athletic exerci&s;es. His judgment, ever a prominent feature in his character, ripen|ed at an immature age into the able negociator;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See note (E) in the Appendix.</HI></NOTE> and his bold and enterprizing &s;pirit, features no le&s;s prominent, into the hardihood of the veteran &s;oldier; and at the age of twenty he gained the meridian of ordinary life. The we&s;tern tribes of Indians, the French commander at Fort Du Que&s;ne, and the unfortunate Briti&s;h army in the gorges of the Monongahela, all experienced in turn his uncommon addre&s;s in managing a treaty, or in covering the retreat of a &s;hattered army in tho&s;e va&s;t wilds, ere twenty-five years had rolled over him. Already had the government of Vir|ginia committed high betru&s;tments to him. Al|ready had he given &s;trong proofs of his piety<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See note (F) in the Appendix.</HI></NOTE> as
<PB N="17" REF="037627_0015_100EEEE8755244C0">
well as of his patrioti&s;m and valour. He conti|nued to ju&s;tify their confidence, and they to ex|pre&s;s their full &s;en&s;e of it. Thus honoured in his own country; thus e&s;teemed among kindred ci|tizens, how clear his title to that honour and e&s;teem! What then mu&s;t have been their regret, when his health, impaired by the rigour of &s;ervice and &s;evere fatigue, rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for him to retire from the &s;ervice, in &s;eventeen hundred fifty-nine?</P>
<P>FROM this time to the year &s;eventy-five, we may perhaps mo&s;t properly view him as the American farmer, though employed in various public offices, be&s;ides a &s;eat in the Legi&s;lature. Situated on the &s;ummit of the very high ground called <HI>Mount-Vernon,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See note (G) in the Appendix.</HI></NOTE> he converts that beautiful &s;pot into a prolific garden, variegated into a mo&s;t enchanting &s;cenery. The arts of peace are le&s;s &s;plendid, but more u&s;eful than tho&s;e of war. By agricultural arts and improvements he rendered an exten&s;ive plantation a &s;ource of wealth to him|&s;elf, and of in&s;truction to others. This favour|ite &s;pot now became more dear than ever, by a happy connubial union with the amiable and ac|compli&s;hed Mrs. CUSTIS, the a&s;&s;iduous &s;harer of all his future anxieties, as well as partner of his joys. Dome&s;tic and agricultural concerns
<PB N="18" REF="037627_0016_100EEEEACF509010">
now unite their friendly beams to &s;peed his way in tho&s;e delightful pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>IN &s;eventy-four, we find him among the a&s;&s;em|bled worthies and patriots at Philadelphia. The portentous cloud hangs over the land&mdash;it is fraught with ire. Soon does the lightening &s;la&s;h from beneath the dark curdling carr that bears death and de&s;truction to all hopes of reconcilia|tion with a parent country. Already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the metropolis of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, they i&s;&s;ue forth, and on the ever-memorable nineteenth of April, &s;eventy-five, Lexington and Concord pre|&s;ent the malancholy vi&s;age of &s;laughtered citi|zens. With eagerne&s;s our patriotic yeomanry ru&s;h to the encrim&s;oned field. But what is a ho&s;t without a head? Whither, O whither &s;hall we turn, to find a leader who&s;e powers &s;hall ju&s;tify the hope of &s;ucce&s;sful re&s;i&s;tance? Behold, in the mid&s;t of our patriot band one appears&mdash;
<Q>"<HI>Toto vertice &s;upere&s;t.</HI>"</Q>
<Q>"A whole head above the re&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>IT is a WASHINGTON! He is unanimou&s;ly elected <HI>Commander in Chief of the armies to be rai&s;ed for the defence of the country.</HI> "It is per|haps his peculiar glory, that there was not a &s;in|gle inhabitant of the&s;e States, except him&s;elf, who did not approve the choice, and place the firme&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="037627_0017_100EEEECE9CB7680">
confidence in his integrity and abilities." But his native mode&s;ty induced him to expre&s;s deep apprehen&s;ions of his inability to perform the mo|mentous duties which &s;uch a tru&s;t devolved up|on him. Obedient to his country's call, he evin|ced the motives of his acceptance to be neither mercenary nor vain, by declining any compen&s;a|tion for per&s;onal &s;ervices.</P>
<P>BIDDING adieu to his compatriots in the great council of the nation, he betakes him&s;elf to the field, where his abilities are more needed. The re&s;pectful gratulations of all cla&s;&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See note (H) in the Appendix.</HI></NOTE> of people, as he pa&s;&s;ed the country; the joy and exultation of the army on his arrival at Cambridge, in July, are evincive of the in&s;tinctive confidence which his name in&s;pired. How well qualified he was to take the command of an undi&s;ciplined, unpro|vided army, to reduce them to order, and to with&s;tand as large and well appointed an army as perhaps was ever &s;ent out of Europe, command|ed by able and experienced officers, the event has proved. His unimpeached conduct during an eight years war, attended with the mo&s;t trying circum&s;tances, is an eulogium that can receive no addition, unle&s;s it be from the uniform and in|vincible attachment of the officers and &s;oldiers of his army to his per&s;on during that period.</P>

<P>SIR HENRY CLINTON left Philadelphia on the June following; our hero pur&s;ued by a circuitous march of near one hundred and fifty miles, and overtook him on the burning plains of Monmouth.

<P>DURING the above gloomy period, when the bolde&s;t heart needed &s;upport from &s;ome quarter, it was oppre&s;&s;ed by the reiterated defeats in Ca|nada, with the lo&s;s of Generals MONTGOMERY and THOMAS; the de&s;truction of a fleet on Lake Champlain; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Rhode-I&s;land by the enemy; the evacuation of Ticonderoga, and the wanton deva&s;tations of VAUGHAN, on the North-River. Pre&s;&s;ed by the fortuitous concu&s;&s;ion of events on every &s;ide, he &s;ends General GATES to retrieve the northern department. He &s;uc|ceeds, and BURGOYNE with his army &s;urrenders. He projects, with indefatigable attention, an at|tack on Stoney-Point, which, with Verplank's-Point, had yielded to the enemy: the deep laid plan &s;ucceeds, and the garri&s;on laid down their arms.

<P>THE time for di&s;banding the army arrived&mdash;and now arrived the mighty trial of patriotic vir|tue. Talk not of a Cae&s;ar! He was brave, but would have en&s;laved his country.

He delug|ed countries in blood, but &s;aved none; and wept becau&s;e his ambition was not yet &s;atiated with conque&s;t.&mdash;It is left for a WASHINGTON to give the noble&s;t example of virtue, of religion,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See note (N) in the Appendix.</HI></NOTE> of greatne&s;s. He conquered for his country. He triumphed in their affections, and at their feet he laid his hard-earned laurels.

<P>NOR were the energies of his talents le&s;s fit|ted to our &s;ituation in peace, than to our exi|gencies in war: and this &s;ingular adaptation of talents to circum&s;tances, proved an eminent ble&s;&s;ing to the United States.</P>

But when the pre&s;&s;ure of common danger was at an end, the weakne&s;s of the federal government was more fully perceived. The rare phaenome|non of a political revolution is now to be ac|compli&s;hed by deliberative a&s;&s;embly. The con|vention of the States for framing a new con&s;ti|tution of government, place their late Com|mander in Chief in the chair of &s;tate.

Having &s;erved the public forty-five years, and nature claiming repo&s;e, he expre&s;&s;es his earne&s;t wi&s;h to retire from public life, in an addre&s;s, which ought to form the political creed of every &s;on and daughter of the land.

<P>BUT his repo&s;e is not long to remain undi&s;turb|ed. The will of his country is his own will; her exigencies impo&s;e an obligation upon him, which he cannot re&s;i&s;t. He obeys her call, un|der the threatening pro&s;pects of war from abroad, and greatly accepts the appointment of Lieuten|ant-General of the forces to be rai&s;ed for &s;uch emergencies.

Let his name be ever dear to you, and never &s;peak, never think of him but with gratitude, re&s;pect and affection.</P>

<P>ON the 23d of December, the afflicting news of General WASHINGTON's death reached this town. The author of the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e would have deemed him&s;elf deficient in duty and in patrioti&s;m, in omitting the ear|lie&s;t opportunity to pay his&punc; &s;mall tribute of re&s;pect to the memory of &s;o much worth; which he attempted, in an appropriate di&s;cour&s;e, on the following &s;ab|bath; a copy of which was reque&s;ted for the pre&s;s; but the publication was omitted on account of the appointment of the 22d of February for commem|orating that event through the United States. The pulpit, the communion-table and the orche&s;tre, &s;hrouded with black; the cypre&s;s bows and fe&s;toons over the chancel and the Venetian window, and around the columns and the urns, and the emblematical mourning piece in front of the de&s;k, &s;hewed the prompt feelings of the congregation on the occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>General WASHINGTON took this po&s;ition in a fore&s;t, at Valley-Forge, about the 24th of December, 1777, the &s;now being about half-leg deep, with very few axes to build their huts with. This cantonment General HOWE called, by way of ridicule, "the Indian-Town." It was &s;ufficient, however, to keep him qui|et within his own lines, in Philadelphia, though the army was in an extreme &s;tate of &s;uffering, for want of provi&s;ion and cloathing. So great were their di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, that General WASHINGTON perhaps never felt deeper anxiety than on their account. Being on a vi&s;it at head-quarters, he enquired with great &s;olicitude how the &s;oldiery fared, and how they &s;upported their &s;ufferings; and when told,

"with patience and fortitude," he exclaimed, the tears &s;tarting from his eyes, "<HI>what will not the&s;e brave men endure for the good of their country!</HI>"</P>

<P>In proof of this, many things might be adduced. The frugality and econo|my of a table &s;upplied by the public; the order, &s;obriety and moderation ever ob|&s;erved at it, are evincive of virtuous habits, and of the influence of his pre&s;ence in re&s;training profanity, intemperance and licentiou&s;ne&s;s; for the&s;e never pol|luted the &s;ocial repa&s;t, nor offended the cha&s;te&s;t ear. His religious example &s;hone in uniformly acknowledging an overruling Providence, a&s;cribing all his &s;ucce&s;&s;es to that, and in calling on the army "to a&s;&s;emble at their re&s;pective parades, to offer up their unfeigned thanks to Almighty God, for the &s;ucce&s;s he had granted them;" be&s;ides his attendance at public wor&s;hip on the &s;abbath, whenever the &s;tate of the army permitted, with great apparent devotion. To the above may be added, his frequently calling on the officers and &s;oldiers, in gene|ral orders, to avoid vice and profanity. Of the many in&s;tances of this, the two following are offered:</P>

<P>"While we are performing the duty of good citizens and &s;oldiers, we ought not to be inattentive to the higher duties of religion. To the di&s;tingui&s;hed char|acter of a patriot, it &s;hould be our highe&s;t glory to add the more di&s;tingui&s;hed character of a <HI>chri&s;tian."</HI></P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT from GENERAL ORDERS, July 29th, 1779.</HEAD>
<P>"Many and pointed orders have been i&s;&s;ued again&s;t that unmeaning and abomi|nable cu&s;tom of &s;wearing; notwith&s;tanding which, with much regret, the Gen|eral ob&s;erves it prevails, if <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> more than ever; his feelings are continual|ly wounded by the oaths and imprecations of the &s;oldiers, whenever he is in hearing of them. The name of that Being, from who&s;e bountiful goodne&s;s we are permitted to exi&s;t, and enjoy the comforts of life, is con&s;tantly imprecated and profaned, in a manner as wanton as it is &s;hocking. For the &s;ake, therefore, of religion, decency and order, the General hopes and tru&s;ts that officers of every rank will u&s;e their influence and authority to check a vice which is as unprofita|ble as it is wicked and &s;hameful."</P>
<P>He was a &s;tranger to religious prejudices, not from an indifference to religion it&s;elf, but from a conviction of the benevolent de&s;igns of that &s;cheme of religion, which taught him to live and act as a chri&s;tian, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the feelings of a man, and not of a party. He was educated in the outward profe&s;&s;ion of the Epi&s;copal Church; but his candour towards all religious denominations was manife&s;ted on all occa&s;ions. His an&s;wer to the addre&s;s of the Jews at Newport, will remain a la&s;ting monument of this&mdash;"And it is the glory of the United States, that, with the &s;tar of empire, fixed therein is the brighter &s;un of univer&s;al toleration."</P>
