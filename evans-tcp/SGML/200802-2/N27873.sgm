<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF TOM WHITE, THE POSTILLION.</HEAD>
<P>TOM WHITE was one of the be&s;t drivers of a Po&s;t chai&s;e on the Bath Road.&mdash;Tom was the &s;on of an hone&s;t la|bourer at a little village in Wilt&s;hire: he was an active indu&s;trious bay, and as &s;oon as he was big enough he left his father, who was burthened with a numerous fa|mily, and went to live with Farmer Hodges, a &s;ober worthy man in the &s;ame village. He drove the waggon all the week; and on Sundays though he was now grown up, the farm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him to attend the Sunday School carried on under the in&s;pection of Dr. Shepherd, the worthy Vicar, and alw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">de him read his Bible, in the evening <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he had &s;er|ved his bea&s;ts, and would have turned him out of his &s;ervice if he had ever gone to the ale-hou&s;e for his own plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="037138_0003_100C835DF3052070">Tom by carrying &s;ome waggon-loads of faggots to the Bear-inn at Devizes, &s;oon made many acquaintances in the &s;ta|ble-yard. He compared his own Carter's frock, and &s;hoes thick &s;et with nails, with the &s;mart red jackets and tight boots of the Po&s;t-boys, and grew a&s;hamed of his own homely dre&s;s; he was re&s;olved to drive a chai&s;e, to get money, and to &s;ee the world. Fooli&s;h fellow! he never con|&s;idered, that, though it is true, a waggon|er works hard all day, yet he gets a quiet evening, and undi&s;turbed re&s;t at night. However there mu&s;t be chai&s;e-boys as well as plough-boys, there was no great harm in the change. The evil company to which it expo&s;ed him, was the chief mi&s;|chief. He left farmer Hodges though not without &s;orrow at quitting &s;o kind a ma&s;|ter, and got him&s;elf hired at the Black Bear.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the temptations to which he was now expo&s;ed, Tom's good education <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by him for &s;ome time. At fir&s;t he was frightened to hear the oaths and wicked words which are too often ut|tered in a &s;table-yard. However, though he thought it wrong, he had not the cou|rage
<PB N="4" REF="037138_0004_100C835F77C94BB8">
to reprove it, and the next &s;tep to being ea&s;y at &s;eeing others &s;in, is to &s;in our&s;elves. By degrees he began to think it manly, and a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of &s;pirit in others to &s;wear; though the force of good habits was &s;o &s;trong, that at fir&s;t when he &s;wore it was with fear and in a low voice. But he was &s;oon laughed out of his &s;heepi&s;h|ne&s;s, as they called it; and though he ne|ver became &s;o prophane and bla&s;phemous as &s;ome of his companions, for he never &s;wore in cool blood or in mirth as &s;o ma|ny do, yet he would too often u&s;e a dread|ful bad word when he was in a pa&s;&s;ion with his hor&s;es. And here I cannot but drop a hint on the great folly as well as wickedne&s;s of being in a great rage with poor bea&s;ts, who not having the gift of rea&s;on, cannot be moved like human crea|tures, with all the wicked words that are &s;aid to them; but who, unhappily, ha|ving the gift of feeling, &s;uffer as much as human creatures can do, at the cruel and unnece&s;&s;ary beatings g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them. He had been bred up to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> drunken|ne&s;s was a great &s;in, for he never &s;aw far|mer Hodges drunk in his life, and where a farmer is &s;ober, his men are le&s;s apt to

drink, or if they do, the ma&s;ter can re|prove them with the better grace.</P>
<P>Tom was not naturally fond of drink, yet for the &s;ake of being thought merry company, and a hearty fellow, he often drank more than he ought. As he had been u&s;ed to go to church twice on a Sun|day while he lived with the farmer, who &s;eldom u&s;ed his hor&s;es on that day except to carry his wife to church behind him, Tom felt a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ea&s;y when he was &s;ent the very fir&s;t Sunday a long journey with a great family; for I cannot conceal the truth that too many gentle folks will tra|vel when there is no nece&s;&s;ity for it on a Sunday, and when Monday would an&s;wer the end ju&s;t as well. This is a great grief to all good and &s;ober people, both rich and poor. However he kept his thoughts to him&s;elf, though he could not now and then help thinking how quietly things were going on at the farmer's, who&s;e wag|goner on a &s;unday led as ea&s;y a life as if he had been a gentleman. But he &s;oon lo&s;t all thoughts of this kind, and did not know a Sunday from a Monday. Tom went on pro&s;perou&s;ly, as it is called&punc; for three or four years, got plenty of money,
<PB N="6" REF="037138_0006_100C836C5F61FF20">
but &s;aved not a Shilling. As &s;oon as his hor&s;es were once in the &s;table, whoever would might &s;ee them fed for Tom.&mdash;He had other fi&s;h to fry.&mdash;Fives, cards, cudg|el-playing, laying wagers, and keeping loo&s;e company, each of which he at fir&s;t di&s;liked, and then practi&s;ed, ran away with all his money, and all his &s;pare time; and though he was generally in the way as &s;oon as the hor&s;es were ready, (becau&s;e if there was no driving there was no pay,) yet he did not care whether the carriage was clean or the hor&s;es looked well, if the harne&s;s was whole, or the hor&s;es were &s;hod. The certainty that the gains of to|morrow would make up for the extrava|gance of to-day, made him quite thought|le&s;s and happy, for he was young, active, and healthy, and never fore&s;aw that a rainy day might come, when he would want what he now &s;quandered.</P>
<P>One day being a little flu&s;tered with liquor as he was driving his return chai&s;e through Brentford, he &s;aw ju&s;t before him another empty carriage, driven by one of his acquaintance; he whipped his hor|&s;es, re&s;olving to out&s;trip the other, and &s;wearing dreadfully that he would be at
<PB N="7" REF="037138_0007_100C836EA4DCDBF0">
the Red Lion fir&s;t&mdash;for a pint&mdash;done, cried the other&mdash;a wager.&mdash;Both cut and &s;purred the poor bea&s;ts with the u&s;ual fu|ry, as if their credit had been really at &s;take, or their lives had depended on this foolli&s;h conte&s;t. Tom's chai&s;e had now got up to that of his rival, and they drove along &s;ide of each other with great fury and many imprecations. But in a nar|row part, Tom's chai&s;e being in the mid|dle, with his antagoni&s;t on one &s;ide, and a cart driving again&s;t him on the other, the hor&s;es reared, the carriages got entan|gled, Tom roared out a great oath to the other to &s;top, which he either could not, or would not do, but returned a horrid imprecation that he would win the wa|ger if he was alive. Tom's hor&s;es took fright and he was thrown to the ground with great violence. As &s;oon as he could be got from under the wheels, he was ta|ken up &s;en&s;ele&s;s; his leg was broke in two places, and his body much brui&s;ed. Some people whom the noi&s;e had brought together, put him into the po&s;t-chai&s;e, in which the waggoner kindly a&s;&s;i&s;ted, but the other driver &s;eemed carele&s;s and in|different, and drove off, ob&s;erving with a brutal coolne&s;s, "I am &s;orry I have lo&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="037138_0008_100C83702AE82568">
my pint; I &s;hould have beat him hollow, had it not been for this <HI>little accident.</HI>" Some gentlemen who came out of the Inn, after reprimanding this &s;avage, inquired who he was, wrote to inform his ma&s;ter, and got him di&s;charged: re&s;olving, that neither they nor any of their friends would ever employ him, and he was long out of place.</P>
<P>Tom was taken to one of tho&s;e excel|lent ho&s;pitals with which London abounds. His agonies were dreadful, his leg was &s;et, and a high fever came on. As &s;oon as he was left alone to reflect on his condition, his fir&s;t thought was that he &s;hould die, and his horror was incon|ceivable.&mdash;Alas!" &s;aid he "what will become of my poor &s;oul? I am cut off in the very commi&s;&s;ion of three great &s;ins: &mdash;I was drunk, I was in a horrible pa&s;&s;i|on, and I had oaths and bla&s;phemies in my mouth."&mdash;He tried to pray, but he could not, his mind was all di&s;traction, and he thought he was &s;o very wicked that God would not forgive him: becau&s;e, &s;ays he, "I have &s;inned again&s;t light and knowledge, and a &s;ober education, and good examples, and I de&s;erve nothing
<PB N="9" REF="037138_0009_100C93698FF0CF80">
but puni&s;hment."&mdash;At length he grew light-headed and there was little hopes of his life. Whenever he came to his &s;en&s;es for a few minutes, he cried out, "O! that my old companions could now &s;ee me, &s;urely they would take warning by my &s;ad fate, and repent before it is too late."</P>
<P>By the ble&s;&s;ing of God on the &s;kill of the &s;urgeon, and the care of the nur&s;es he however grew better in a few days. And here let me &s;top to remark, what a mer|cy it is that we live in a chri&s;tian coun|try, where the poor, when &s;ick, or lame, or wounded, are taken as much care of as any gentry: nay in &s;ome re&s;pects more, becau&s;e in ho&s;pitals and infirmaries there are more doctors and &s;urgeons to attend, than mo&s;t private gentlefolks can afford to have at their own hou&s;es whereas <HI>there never was an hospital in the whole heathen world.</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed be God for this, among the thou&s;and other excellent fruits of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION!</P>
<P>It was eight weeks before Tom could be taken out of bed. This was a happy affliction; for this long &s;ickne&s;s and &s;oli|tude
<PB N="10" REF="037138_0010_100C936B8542CD40">
gave him time to reflect on his pa&s;t life. He began &s;eriou&s;ly to hate tho&s;e darling &s;ins which had brought him to the brink of ruin. He could now pray hear|tily: he confe&s;&s;ed and lamented his ini|quities with many tears, and began to hope that the mercies of God, through the merits of a Redeemer, might yet be extended to him on his &s;incere repen|tance. He re&s;olved never more to return to the &s;ame evil cour&s;es, but he did not tru&s;t in his own &s;trength, but prayed that God would give him grace for the future, as well as pardon for the pa&s;t. He re|membered, and he was humbled at the thought that he u&s;ed to have &s;hort fits of repentance, and to form re&s;olutions of amendment, in his wild and thoughtle&s;s days, and often when he had a bad head|ach after a drinking bout, or had lo&s;t his money at all fours, he vowed never to drink or play again. But as &s;oon as his head was well, and his pocket recruited, he forgot all his re&s;olutions. And how &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e? for he tru&s;ted in his own &s;trength, he never prayed to God to &s;trengthen him, nor ever avoided the next temptation.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037138_0011_100C936D73E80A48">The ca&s;e was now different. Tom be|gan to find that <HI>his strength was perfect weakness,</HI> and that he could do nothing without the Divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for which he prayed heartily and con&s;tantly. He &s;ent home for his Bible and Prayer-book, which he had not opened for two years, and which had been given him when he left the Sunday School. He &s;pent the chief part of his time in reading them and thus derived great comfort, as well as great knowledge. The &s;tudy of the bible filled his heart with gratitude to God who had not cut him off in the mid&s;t of his &s;ins, but given him &s;pace for re|pentance; and the agonies he had lately &s;uffered with his broken leg increa&s;ed his thankfulne&s;s, that he had e&s;caped the more dreadful pain of eternal mi&s;ery. And here let me remark what encourage|ment this is for rich people to give away Bibles and good books, and not lo&s;e all hope though for a time they &s;ee little or no good effect from it. According to all appearance, Tom's were never likely to do him any good, and yet his generous benefactor who had ca&s;t his bread upon the waters, &s;ound it after many days, for this bible which had lain untouched for
<PB N="12" REF="037138_0012_100C936FC5351970">
years, was at la&s;t made the means of his reformation. God will work in his own good time.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he got well, and was di&s;|charged from the ho&s;pital, Tom began to think he mu&s;t return to get his bread. At fir&s;t he had &s;ome &s;cruples about going back to his old employ: but &s;ays he, &s;en|&s;ibly enough, gentle folks mu&s;t travel, travellers mu&s;t have chai&s;es, and chai&s;es mu&s;t have drivers; 'tis a very hone&s;t call|ing, and I don't know that goodne&s;s be|longs to one &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s more than another; and he who can be good in a &s;tate of great temptation, provided the calling be lawful, and the temptations are not of his own &s;eeking, and he be di|ligent in prayer, may be better than ano|ther man for aught I know: and <HI>all that belongs to us is to do our duty in that state of life in which it shall please God to call us.</HI> Tom had rubbed up his catechi&s;m at the ho&s;pital and 'tis a pity that people don't look at their catechi&s;m &s;ometimes when they are grown up; for it is full as good for men and women as it is for chil|dren: nay better, for though the an&s;wers contained in it are intended for children
<PB N="13" REF="037138_0013_100C9371B2F355C0">
to <HI>repeat,</HI> yet the duties enjoined in it are intended for men and women to put in <HI>practice.</HI></P>
<P>Tom now felt grieved that he was obli|ged to drive on Sundays. But people who are in earne&s;t, and have their hearts in a thing can find helps in all ca&s;es. As &s;oon as he had &s;et down his company at their &s;tage, and had &s;een his hor&s;es fed, &s;ays Tom, "A man who takes care of his hor&s;es will generally think it right to let them re&s;t an hour or two at lea&s;t. In every town it is a chance but there may be a church open during part of that time. If the prayers &s;hould be over, I'll try hard for the &s;ermon; and if I dare not &s;tay to the Sermon, it is a chance but I may catch the prayers; it is worth trying for, however; and as I u&s;ed to make nothing of making a pu&s;h, for the &s;ake of getting an hour to gamble, I need not grudge to take a little pains extraordinary to &s;erve God. By this watchfulne&s;s he &s;oon got to know the hours of &s;ervice at all the towns on the road he travelled, and while the hor&s;es &s;ed, Tom went to church; and it became a favourite proverb with him
<PB N="14" REF="037138_0014_100C937343AD77A0">
that <HI>prayers and provender hinder no man's journey.</HI></P>
<P>At fir&s;t his companions wanted to laugh and make &s;port of this&mdash;but when they &s;aw that no lad on the road was up &s;o early or worked &s;o hard as Tom: when they &s;aw no chai&s;e &s;o neat, no gla&s;&s;es &s;o bright, no harne&s;s &s;o tight, no driver &s;o diligent, &s;o clean, or &s;o civil, they found he was no &s;ubject to make &s;port at. Tom indeed was very careful in looking after the linch-pins, in never giving his hor&s;es too much water when they were hot; nor, whatever was his ha&s;te, would he ever gallop them up hill, &s;trike them acro&s;s the head, or when tired, cut and fla&s;h them in driving on the &s;tones, as &s;oon as he got into a town, as &s;ome fooli&s;h fellows do. What helped to cure Tom of the&s;e bad practices, was that remark he met with in the Bible, that <HI>a good man is mer|ciful to his beast.</HI> He was much moved on reading the Prophet Jonah, to ob&s;erve what compa&s;&s;ion the great God of heaven and earth had for poor bea&s;ts: for one of the rea&s;ons there given, why the Almighty was unwilling to de&s;troy the great city of Nine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eh was, <HI>because there was much
<PB N="15" REF="037138_0015_100C93752E515490">
cattle in it.</HI> After this Tom never could bear to &s;ee a wanton &s;troke inflicted.</P>
<P>Tom &s;oon grew rich for one in his &s;ta|tion, for every gentleman on the road would be driven by no other lad if <HI>careful Tom</HI> was to be had. Being diligent, he <HI>got</HI> a great deal of money; being frugal, he <HI>spent</HI> but little; and having no vices, he <HI>wasted</HI> none. He &s;oon found out that there was &s;ome meaning in that text which &s;ays, that <HI>Godliness hath the promise of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come</HI>: for the &s;ame principles which make a man &s;ober and hone&s;t, have al&s;o a natural tendency to make him healthy and rich; while a drunkard and a &s;pend-thrift can hardly e&s;cape being &s;ick, and a beggar in the end. Vice is the parent of mi&s;ery here as well as hereafter.</P>
<P>After a few years Tom begged a holi|day, and made a vi&s;it to his native vil|lage; his good character had got thither before him. He found his father was dead, but during his long illne&s;s Tom had &s;upplied him with money, and by allowing him a trifle every week, had had the hone&s;t &s;atisfaction of keeping him
<PB N="16" REF="037138_0016_100C9377AB68ABC0">
from the pari&s;h. Farmer Hodges was &s;till living, but being grown old and infirm, he was de&s;irous to retire from bu&s;ine&s;s. He retained a great regard for his old &s;er|vant, Tom; and finding he was worth money, and knowing he knew &s;omething of country bu&s;ine&s;s, he offered to let him have a &s;mall farm at an ea&s;y rate, and promi&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the management for the fir&s;t year, with the loan of a &s;mall &s;um of money, that he might &s;et out with a pretty &s;tock. Tom thanked him with tears in his eyes, went back and took a hand&s;ome leave of his ma&s;ter, who made him a pre&s;ent of a hor&s;e and cart, in ac|knowledgement of his long and faithful &s;ervices; for, &s;ays he, "I have &s;aved many hor&s;es by Tom's care and attenti|on, and I could well afford to do the &s;ame by every &s;ervant who did the &s;ame by me; and &s;hould be a richer man at the end of every year by the &s;ame genero&s;ity, provi|ded I could meet with ju&s;t and faithful &s;ervants who de&s;erved the &s;ame rewards."</P>
<P>Tom was &s;oon &s;ettled in his new farm, and in le&s;s than a year had got every thing neat and decent about him. Farmer Hodges's long experience and friendly
<PB N="17" REF="037138_0017_100C93799F3F15A0">
advice, joined to his own indu&s;try and hard labour, &s;oon brought the farm to great perfection. The regularity, &s;obrie|ty, peaceablene&s;s, and piety of his daily life, his con&s;tant attendance at Church twice every &s;unday, and his decent and devout behaviour when there, &s;oon re|commended him to the notice of Dr. Shep|herd who was &s;till living, a pattern of zeal, activity, and benevolence to all pa|ri&s;h prie&s;ts. The Dr. &s;oon began to hold up Tom, or as we mu&s;t now more proper|ly term him, Mr. Thomas White, to the imitation of the whole pari&s;h, and the fre|quent, and conde&s;cending conver&s;ation of this worthy clergyman, contributed no le&s;s than his preaching to the improve|ment of his new pari&s;hioner.</P>
<P>Farmer White &s;oon found out that a dairy could not well be carried on without a mi&s;tre&s;s, and began to think &s;eriou&s;ly of marrying; he prayed to God to direct him in &s;o important a bu&s;ine&s;s. He knew that a tawdry, vain, dre&s;&s;y girl, was not like|ly to make good chee&s;e and butter, and that a worldly and ungodly woman would make a &s;ad wife and mi&s;tre&s;s of a family. He &s;oon heard of a young woman of ex|cellent
<PB N="18" REF="037138_0018_100C937B2BC33F40">
character, who had been bred up by the vicar's lady, and &s;till lived in the family as upper maid. She was prudent, &s;ober, indu&s;trious and religious. Her neat, mode&s;t, and plain appearance at church, (for &s;he was &s;eldom &s;een any where el&s;e out of her ma&s;ter's family,) was an example to all per&s;ons in her &s;ta|tion, and never failed to recommend her to &s;trangers, even before they had an op|portunity of knowing the goodne&s;s of her character. It was her character, howe|ver, which recommended her to farmer White. He knew that <HI>favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised:</HI> "aye, and not only prai&s;ed, but cho&s;en too," &s;ays farmer White, as he took down his hat from the nail on which it hung, in order to go and wait on Dr. Shepherd, to break his mind and a&s;k his con&s;ent; for he thought it would be a very unhand&s;ome return for all the favours he was receiving from his Mini&s;ter, to decoy away his faith|ful &s;ervant from her place without his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>This worthy gentleman, though &s;orry to lo&s;e &s;o valuable a member of his little
<PB N="19" REF="037138_0019_100C937D17E6D1F8">
family, did not &s;cruple a moment about parting with her, when he found it would be &s;o greatly to her advantage. Tom was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to hear &s;he had &s;aved fifty pounds by her frugality. The Dr. married them him&s;elf, farmer Hodges being pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In the afternoon Dr. Shepherd conde|&s;cended to call on farmer and Mrs. White, to give a few words of advice on the new duties they had entered into; a common cu&s;tom with him on tho&s;e occa|&s;ions. He often took an opportunity to drop, in the mo&s;t kind and tender way, a hint on the great indecency of making marriages, chri&s;tenings, and above all funerals, days of riot and exce&s;s, as is too often the ca&s;e in country villages. The expectation that the vicar might po&s;&s;ibly drop in, in his walks, on the&s;e fe&s;tivities, &s;ometimes re&s;trained exce&s;&s;ive drinking, and improper conver&s;ation, even among tho&s;e farmers who were not re&s;trained by higher motives, as farmer and Mrs. White were.</P>
<P>What the Dr. &s;aid was always in &s;uch a cheerful, good humoured way, that it

was &s;ure to increa&s;e the plea&s;ure of that day, in&s;tead of damping it. Well, far|mer, &s;aid he, and you my faithful Sarah, any other friend might recommend peace and agreement to you on your marriage; but I on the contrary recommend cares and &s;trifes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dodd's Sayings.</NOTE> The company &s;tared&mdash;but Sarah, who knew that her old ma&s;ter was a facetious gentleman, and always had &s;ome good meaning behind, looked &s;eri|ous, "Cares and &s;trifes, Sir, &s;aid the farmer, what do you mean? I mean &s;aid he, for the fir&s;t, that your cares &s;hall be who &s;hall plea&s;e God mo&s;t, and your &s;trifes, who &s;hall &s;erve him be&s;t, and do your duty mo&s;t faithfully. Thus, all your cares and &s;trifes being employed to the highe&s;t purpo&s;es, all petty cares and worldly &s;trifes &s;hall be at an end.</P>
<P>"Always remember both of you, that you "have &s;till a better friend than each other."&mdash;The company &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed again, and thought no woman could have &s;o good a friend as her hu&s;band. "As you have cho&s;en each other from the be&s;t motives, continued the Doctor, you have every rea|&s;onable ground to hope for happine&s;s;

but as this world is a &s;oil, in which trou|bles and misfortunes will &s;pring up; trou|bles from which you cannot &s;ave one ano|ther: then remember, "'tis he be&s;t wi&s;|dom to go to that friend wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is always near, always willing, and al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ys able to help you, and that friend is <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">OD.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Sir, &s;aid Farmer White, I humbly thank you for all your kind in&s;tructions, of which I &s;hall now &s;tand more in need than ever, as I &s;hall have more duties to fulfil. I hope the remembrance of my pa&s;t offences will keep me humble, and the &s;en&s;e of my remaining &s;in will keep me watchful. I &s;et out in the world, Sir, with what is called a good natural di&s;po|&s;ition, but I &s;oon found to my co&s;t that without GOD's grace that will carry a man but a little way. A good temper is a good thing, but nothing but the fear of GOD can enable one to bear up again&s;t temptation, evil company, and evil pa&s;&s;i|ons. The misfortune of breaking my leg, as I then thought it, has proved the great|e&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of my life. It &s;hewed me my own weakne&s;s, Sir, the value of the Bi|ble, and the goodne&s;s of GOD. How many of my brother drivers have I &s;een
<PB N="22" REF="037138_0022_100C9382DED8E578">
&s;ince that time, cut off in the prime of life by drinking, or by &s;ome &s;udden acci|dent, while I have not only been &s;pared, but ble&s;&s;ed and pro&s;pered. O Sir! it would be the joy of my heart, if &s;ome of my old comrades, good-natured, civil fellows, (whom I can't help loving) could &s;ee as I have done, the danger of evil cour&s;es before it is too late. Though they may not hearken to you, Sir, or any other <HI>Minister,</HI> they may believe <HI>me,</HI> becau&s;e I have been one of them: and I can &s;peak from experience, of the great difference there is, even as to worldly com|fort, between a life of &s;obriety and a life of &s;in. I could tell them, Sir, not as a thing I have read in a book, but as a truth I feel in my own heart, that to fear GOD and keep his commandments, will not only "bring a man peace at the la&s;t," but will make him happy <HI>now.</HI> And I will venture to &s;ay, Sir, that all the &s;tocks, pillories, pri&s;ons, and gibbets in the land, though &s;o very needful to keep bad men in order, yet will never re&s;train a good man from com|mitting evil, half &s;o much as that &s;ingle text, "how &s;hall I do this great wicked|ne&s;s and &s;in again&s;t God?" Dr. Shepherd conde&s;cended to approve of what the

Farmer had &s;aid, kindly &s;hook him by the hand, and took leave.</P>
<P>Thomas White had always been fond of &s;inging, but he had for many years de&s;pi&s;ed that vile tra&s;h which is too often &s;ung in a &s;table-yard. One Sun|day evening he heard his mi&s;tre&s;s at the Bear read &s;ome fine ver&s;es out of a fine book called the Spectator. He was &s;o &s;truck with the picture it contains of the great mercies of God, of which he had him&s;elf partaken &s;o largely, that he took the liberty to a&s;k her for the&s;e ver&s;es, and &s;he being a very good-natured wo|man, made her daughter write out for the po&s;tilion the following.</P>

<P><PB N="26" REF="037138_0026_100C938AB07C7DA8">Tom White, as we have &s;hewn in the fore part of this hi&s;tory, from an idle po&s;t|boy was become a re&s;pectable farmer. GOD had ble&s;&s;ed his indu&s;try, and he had pro&s;pered in the world. He was &s;ober and temperate, and, as was the natural con&s;equence, he was active and healthy. He was indu&s;trious and frugal, and be|came pro&s;perous in his circum&s;tances. This is in the ordinary cour&s;e of Provi|dence. But it is not a certain and nece&s;|&s;ary rule. GOD <HI>maketh his sun to shine on the just and the unjust.</HI> A man who u&s;es every hone&s;t means of thrift and in|du&s;try, will, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, find &s;ucce&s;s attend his labours. But &s;till the <HI>race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.</HI> GOD is &s;ometimes plea&s;ed for wi&s;e ends, to di&s;appoint all the world|ly hopes of the mo&s;t upright man. His corn may be &s;mitten by a blight. His barns may be con&s;umed by fire. His cat|tle may be carried off by di&s;temper. And to the&s;e and other misfortunes, he is as liable as the &s;pendthrift or the knave. Succe&s;s is the <HI>common</HI> reward of indu&s;try, but if it were its <HI>constant</HI> reward, the in|du&s;trious would be tempted to look no further than the pre&s;ent &s;tate. They
<PB N="27" REF="037138_0027_100C938CA01A0480">
would lo&s;e one &s;trong ground of their faith. It would &s;et a&s;ide the Scripture &s;cheme. This world would be looked on as a &s;tate of reward&punc; in&s;tead of a &s;tate of trial, and we &s;hould forget to look to a day of final retribution.</P>
<P>Farmer <HI>White</HI> never took it into his head, that becau&s;e he paid his debts, work|ed early and late, and ate the bread of carefulne&s;s, he was therefore to come in|to no <HI>misfortune like other folk,</HI> but was to be free from the common trials and troubles of life. He knew that pro&s;peri|ty was far from being a &s;ure mark of GOD's favour, and had read in good books, and e&s;pecially in the bible, of the great pover|ty and afflictions of the be&s;t of men. Though he was no great &s;cholar, he had &s;en&s;e enough to ob&s;erve, that a time of public pro&s;perity was not always a time of public virtue; and he thought that what was true of a whole nation might be true of one man. So the more he pro&s;|pered the more he prayed that pro&s;perity might not corrupt his heart. And when he &s;aw lately &s;igns of public di&s;tre&s;s com|ing on, he was not half &s;o much frighten|ed as &s;ome others were, becau&s;e he thought
<PB N="28" REF="037138_0028_100C938F1D8E6030">
it might do us good in the long run; and he was in hopes that a little poverty might bring on a little penitence. The great grace he laboured after was that of a cheerful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, that if the Lord's Prayer had only con|tained tho&s;e four little words THY WILL BE DONE, it would be worth more than the bigge&s;t book in the world without them.</P>
<P>Dr. Shepherd the worthy vicar, (with whom the farmer's wife had formerly li|ved as hou&s;ekeeper) was very fond of ta|king a walk with him about his grounds, and he u&s;ed to &s;ay, that he learnt as much from the farmer as the farmer did from him. If the Doctor happened to ob&s;erve, I am afraid the long rains will &s;poil this fine piece of oats, the farmer would an|&s;wer, "but then, &s;ir, think how good it is for the gra&s;s." If the Doctor feared the wheat would be but indifferent, the farmer was &s;ure the rye would turn out well. When gra&s;s &s;ailed, he did not doubt but turnips would be plenty. Even for floods and inundations he would find out &s;ome way to ju&s;tify Providence. "'Tis better," &s;aid he, "to have our lands a
<PB N="29" REF="037138_0029_100C939109526DC8">
little overflowed, than that the &s;prings &s;hould be dried up, and our cattle &s;aint for lack of water." When the drought came, he thanked GOD that the &s;ea&s;on would be healthy; and high winds, which frightened others, he &s;aid &s;erved to clear the air. Whoever, or whatever was wrong, he was always &s;ure that PROVI|DENCE was in the right. And he u&s;ed to &s;ay, that a man with ever &s;o &s;mall an income if he had but frugality and tem|perance, and ca&s;t off all vain de&s;ires, was richer than a lord who was tormented by vanity and covetou&s;ne&s;s. When he &s;aw others in the wrong, he did not how|ever abu&s;e them for it, but took care to avoid the &s;ame fault. He had &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit enough to break through many old but very bad cu&s;toms of his neighbours. "If a thing is wrong in it&s;elf." (&s;aid he one day to farmer Hodges) "a whole pari&s;h doing it can't make it right. And as to it's being an old cu&s;tom, why if it be a good one I like it the better for being old, becau&s;e it has had the &s;tamp of ages, and the &s;anction of experience on it's worth. But if it be old as well as bad, that is another rea&s;on for my trying to

put an end to it, that we may not mi&s;lead our children as our fathers have mi&s;led us."</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The ROOF-RAISING.</HEAD>
<P>SOME years after he was &s;ettled, he built a large new barn. All the work|men were looking forward to the u&s;ual holiday of roof-rai&s;ing. On this occa&s;ion it was a cu&s;tom to give a dinner to the workmen, with &s;o much liquor after it that they got &s;o drunk, that they not on|ly lo&s;t the remaining half days work, but they were not always able to work the next day.</P>
<P>Mrs. White provided a plentiful din|ner for roof-rai&s;ing, and gave each man his mug of beer. After a hearty meal they began to grow clamourous for more drink. The farmer &s;aid, "My lads, I don't grudge you a few gallons of ale merely for the &s;ake of &s;aving my liquor, though that is &s;ome con&s;ideration; but I never will, knowingly, help any man to make a bea&s;t of him&s;elf. I am re&s;olved to
<PB N="31" REF="037138_0031_100C9394917CEDC0">
break through a bad cu&s;tom. You are now well refre&s;hed. If you will go chear|fully to your work, you will have half a day's pay to take on Saturday night more than you would if this afternoon were wa&s;ted in drunkenne&s;s. For this your families will be the better; whereas, were I to give you more liquor when you have already had enough, I &s;hould help to rob them of their bread. But I wi&s;h to &s;hew you, that I have your good at heart full as much as my own profit. If you will now go to work, I will give you all ano|ther mug at night when you leave off. Thus your time will be &s;aved, your fami|lies helped, and my ale will not go to make rea&s;onable creatures wor&s;e than brute bea&s;ts."</P>
<P>Here he &s;topped. "You are in the right on't, Ma&s;ter," &s;aid Tom the thatcher; "You are a hearty man, Farmer," &s;aid John Plane the carpenter. "Come along boys," &s;aid Tim Brick the ma&s;on; &s;o they all went merrily to work, fortified with a good dinner. There was only one drunken &s;urly fellow who refu&s;ed, that was Dick Guzzle the Smith. Dick ne|ver works above two or three days in the
<PB N="32" REF="037138_0032_100C9396E299C9C0">
week, and &s;pends the others at the Red Lion. He &s;wore that if the farmer did not let him have as much liquor as he li|ked at Roof-Rai&s;ing, he would not &s;trike another &s;troke, but he would leave the job unfini&s;hed, and he might get hands where he could. Farmer White took him at his word, and paid him off directly: glad enough to get rid of &s;uch a &s;ot, whom he had only employed from pity to a large and almo&s;t &s;tarving family. When the men came for their mug in the evening, the farmer brought out the remains of the cold gammon: they made a hearty &s;up|per, and thanked him for having broke through a fooli&s;h cu&s;tom, which was af|terwards much left off in that pari&s;h, though Dick would not come into it and lo&s;t mo&s;t of his work.</P>
<P>Farmer White's labourers were often complaining, that things were &s;o dear that they could not buy a bit of meat. He knew it was partly true, but not en|tirely, for it was before the&s;e very hard times. One morning he &s;tept out to &s;ee how an outhou&s;e which he was thatching went on. He was &s;urpri&s;ed to find the work at a &s;tand. He walked over to the
<PB N="33" REF="037138_0033_100C9398EB0DB2B0">
thatcher's hou&s;e. "Tom," &s;aid he, "I de&s;ire that piece of work may be fini&s;hed directly. If a &s;hower comes my grain will be &s;poiled." "Indeed, Ma&s;ter I &s;han't work to-day, nor to-morrow, neither," &s;aid Tom. "You forget that 'tis Ea&s;ter Monday, and to-morrow is Ea&s;ter Tue&s;|day. And &s;o on Wedne&s;day I &s;hall thatch away ma&s;ter. But 'tis hard if a poor man who works all the year may not en|joy the&s;e few holidays."</P>
<P>"Tom," &s;aid the farmer, "when the&s;e days where fir&s;t put into our prayer-book, the good men who did it, little thought that the time would come when holyday &s;hould mean drunken-day. How much do&s;t think now I &s;hall pay thee for this piece of thatch?" "Why you know ma&s;ter you have let it to me by the great. I think between this and tomorrow night, as the weather is &s;o fine, I could clear about four &s;hillings, after I have paid my boy. But thatching does not come often, and other work is not &s;o profitable." "Very well, Tom; and how much now do you think you may &s;pend in the&s;e two holidays?" "Why ma&s;ter, if the ale is plea&s;ant, and the company merry, I do
<PB N="34" REF="037138_0034_100C939A7803F740">
not expect to get off for le&s;s than three &s;hillings." "Tom can you do pounds, &s;hillings, and pence?" "I can make a little &s;core ma&s;ter behind the kitchen door with a bit of chalk, which is as much as I want." "Well, Tom, add the four &s;hil|lings you would have earned to the three you intend to &s;pend, what does that make?" "Let me &s;ee! three and four make &s;even. Seven &s;hillings ma&s;ter." "Tom, you often tell me the times are &s;o bad that you can never buy a bit of meat. Now here is the co&s;t of two joints at once; to &s;ay nothing of the &s;in of wa&s;t|ing time and getting drunk." I never once thought of that," &s;aid Tom. "Now Tom," &s;aid the farmer, "if I were you, I would &s;tep over to Butcher Jobbins's, buy a &s;houlder of mutton, which being left from &s;aturday's market you will get a little cheaper. This I would make my wife bake in a deep di&s;h full of potatoes. I would then go to work, and when the dinner was ready I would go and enjoy it with my wife and children; you need not give the mutton to the children; the potatoes will have all the gravy, and be very favory for them." "Aye, but I've got no beer ma&s;ter, the times are &s;o hard
<PB N="35" REF="037138_0035_100C939C785981B0">
that a poor man can't afford to brew a drop of drink now as we u&s;ed to do."</P>
<P>"Times are bad, and malt is very dear Tom, and yet both don't prevent your throwing away &s;even &s;hillings in keeping holiday. Now &s;end for a quart of ale, as it is to be a fea&s;t; and you will even then be four &s;hillings richer than if you had gone to the publick hou&s;e. I would put by the&s;e four &s;hillings, till I could add a couple to them; with this I could get a bu&s;hel of malt, and my wife &s;hould brew it, and you may take a pint at home of a night, which will do you more good than a gallon at the Red Lion." "I have a great mind to take your advice, ma&s;ter, but I &s;hall be made &s;uch fun of at the Lion; they will &s;o laugh at me if I don't go." "Let tho&s;e laugh that win, Tom." "But ma&s;ter, I have got a friend to meet me there." "Then a&s;k your friend to come and eat a bit of your cold mutton at night, and here is &s;ix-pence for another pot, if you will promi&s;e to brew a &s;mall ca&s;k of your own." "Thank you, ma&s;|ter, and &s;o I will; and I won't go to the Lion. Come boy, bring the helm, and fetch the ladder." And &s;o Tom was upon the roof in a twinkling.</P>
