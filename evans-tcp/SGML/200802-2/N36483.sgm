<P>You are but of ye&s;terday, and know but little: little in|deed of the God that made you, of the Saviour who came to redeem you. You know little of the world in which you live, or of that world in which you are to live for ever. You &s;tand in need of daily in|&s;truction, both in the concerns of your &s;oul and body; but your compa&s;&s;ionate &s;hepherd has

<P>He has &s;aid, A&s;k and ye &s;hall receive, &s;eek and ye &s;hall find.</P>
<P>Are you at a lo&s;s what to a&s;k? A&s;k, above all things, his favour, which is life: and his loving kindne&s;s, which is better than life. A&s;k him to teach you more of him&s;elf, of his greatne&s;s, and goodne&s;s, that you may love him more, and &s;erve him better.</P>
<P>You are not only ignorant, but like the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eeble lamb, you are helple&s;s, and can do but little for your own &s;afety and

protection. You are expo&s;ed to many dangers that you know nothing of: there are many di&s;|orders to which your infant years are liable, and a thou&s;and accidents to which your tender frames are expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>How happy, amid&s;t all this weakne&s;s and dangers, to re|flect, that your kind &s;hepherd has promi&s;ed to gather you in his arms, and carry you in his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Your parents do much for you, and you have rea&s;on to thank God for them. But <HI>Je|&s;us,</HI> your kind &s;hepherd, can do much more, he can &s;upply all your need; in &s;ickne&s;s he can

<P>Often think, children, how much love and compa&s;&s;ion are contained in tho&s;e delightful words: He &s;hall gather them in his arms, and carry them in his bo&s;om.

<Q><HI>Feed my lambs.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>YOU have heard children, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> your kind &s;hepherd, while he was here upon earth, folded the lambs in his arms, and carried them in his bo&s;om; and as he was now about to leave this world, and go to his Father, it was natural he &s;hould be concerned about his flock&mdash;what would become of his &s;heep and his lambs: he was going
<PB N="21" REF="047686_0021_10243E0920E41EC8">
to leave them in a world full of difficulties and dangers; he was afraid they might meet with &s;trange &s;hepherds who would not care for the flock, nor lead them into good pa&s;|tures; and that they would be like &s;heep having no &s;hepherd.</P>
<P>As <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was thus caring for his &s;heep, he looked round up|on his di&s;ciples, and fixing his eyes upon <HI>Peter,</HI> who had pro|fe&s;&s;ed to love him better than the re&s;t, he &s;aid unto him, <HI>Si|mon,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Jonas,</HI> love&s;t thou me? He &s;aid unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knowe&s;t that I love thee, He &s;aith unto him, Feed my lambs, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;aid unto him
<PB N="22" REF="047686_0022_10243E0C32FA6A40">
the third time, <HI>Simon,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Jonas,</HI> love&s;t thou me, <HI>Peter</HI> was grieved, becau&s;e he &s;aid unto him the third time, Love&s;t thou me?

<P>You have all, my little friends, been taught to &s;ay, Our Father who art in heaven:

<P>The God who made them does not forget to give them their daily bread; numerous as they are, there is food pro|vided for them all: the trees are loaded with berries, that the birds may not want food in winter. Your heavenly Father is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works.

on earth, that you may dwell with him, and be happy here|after in heaven.</P>
<P>The &s;parrows know not the God who made them, the hand that feeds them; but you, chil|dren, can know and remember your Creator; you can love the God who feeds and clothes you; you can pray to him daily for what mercies you want, and give him thanks for what you receive; you can love him as your heavenly Father, and you are &s;ure that he will never for|get you.</P>

<P>He who heareth the young ravens when they cry, will much more hear you when you cry unto him. Are you poor? fear not; for the poor man cries, and the Lord hears him, and delivers him out of all his trouble. Are you fatherle&s;s? fear not; for God is the Father of the fatherle&s;s. Or have your father and mother for&s;aken you? fear not; for the Lord will take you up. He knows

all your wants, and all your fears; nothing can befal you without his permi&s;&s;ion. Are you &s;ick? whom the Lord lov|eth he cha&s;teneth; to &s;how how much your heavenly Father cares for you, he has &s;aid, The very hairs of your head are all numbered.</P>
<P>Does your heavenly Father thus care for you, then, chil|dren, what have you to fear? You have nothing to fear but &s;in; nothing to fear but di&s;|plea&s;ing God: to make God angry with you would be &s;ad indeed; but if you love and &s;erve him, you need not fear that he will be angry with you,

he is only angry with the wicked, with tho&s;e who do not love and &s;erve him.</P>
<P>Remember, he expects more from you than from the fowls of the air: God has not given them rea&s;on, and therefore he expects nothing from them; but he expects that you &s;hould love him as your heavenly Fa|ther, and be his dutiful and o|bedient children.

from God; therefore &s;he went up to the temple of God, the hou&s;e of prayer, and there poured out her &s;oul before God.</P>
<P>And &s;he vowed a vow, and &s;aid, O Lord of ho&s;ts! if thou wilt indeed look upon the af|fliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid; but will give unto thy hand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aid a man-child; then will I give him unto the Lord all the days of his life.</P>

the honour to &s;erve God in his temple, and mini&s;ter to the Lord in holy things. And when God had given her the child &s;he had a&s;ked of him, &s;he remembered the vow &s;he had made; and as &s;oon as he was weaned, &s;he took him with her to the hou&s;e of God, and brought him to <HI>Eli,</HI> the high prie&s;t, and there, in the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mn manner, devoted her child, and gave him up unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Lord, in the words of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ext: for this child I prayed; and the Lord hath granted my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">etition; therefore al&s;o I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ent him to the Lord; as long
<PB N="109" REF="047686_0109_10243E7FAF20AE98">
as he liveth, he &s;hall be lent to the Lord.</P>
<P>From this plea&s;ing hi&s;tory, we learn what is the duty of pi|ous parents: It is to acknow|ledge, that they receive their children at the hand of God, and to devote them to his fear and &s;ervice. And, perhaps, &s;ome of you, my little friends, like <HI>Samuel,</HI> have had a pious mother, who has devoted you to the Lord: They have &s;aid in &s;ome &s;uch language as this: For this child I prayed, and the Lord hath granted my reque&s;t. It is God who hath given it to me, and &s;hall not I devote it to him, and to his &s;ervice?</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="047686_0110_10243E830F64CFA8">
He hath &s;aid, All &s;ouls are mine; the &s;oul of the father, and the &s;oul of the &s;on; and when he puts this child into my hands, does he not, as it were, &s;ay, Here is an immortal &s;oul that may be happy or mi|&s;erable for ever; bring it up for me and my &s;ervice.</P>
<P>And is it po&s;&s;ible that this dear child, whom I &s;o tenderly love, may be made, through my neglect, for ever mi&s;erable? Dreadful thought! But how plea&s;ing to think, that, with the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon my endeavours, it may be taught to know the God who made it, to love and &s;erve him here, and
<PB N="111" REF="047686_0111_10243E855B0E6440">
to dwell with him for ever and ever. Delightful thought! Soon as its infant tongue can &s;peak, it &s;hall be taught the prai&s;es of its God and Saviour, its little hands be lifted up to the God of its mercies, and its feet taught the way to the hou&s;e of its Creator. O, my God! I de&s;ire not that it may be rich or great in this world; only give it a heart to love and &s;erve thee: to thee who gave it to me, would I &s;olemnly de|vote it, and may it be thine for ever!</P>
<P>This has been the language of many a pious mother; and we would hope, children, of
<PB N="112" REF="047686_0112_10243E8731E76BD0">
&s;ome of yours. And &s;urely you will not di&s;appoint their plea&s;ing hopes and expectati|ons? Con&s;ider the many prayers they have put up for you, the many tears they have &s;hed upon your account. How can they bear the thought, that their children &s;hould be the children of the devil, in&s;tead of the children of God! Do they love God above all things, and mu&s;t they not de&s;ire that you &s;hould love him too?

My little friends, you are the fig-trees in God's vineyard: God is the hu&s;bandman: you are the plants which his right hand has planted. He has planted you in the choice&s;t ground, where &s;treams of hea|venly mercy &s;low, and words of &s;weet &s;alvation &s;ound; a|mid&s;t all the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel and the means of grace. Your pious parents have nour|i&s;hed and cheri&s;hed you; they have in&s;tructed you, they have prayed for you, your mini&s;ters have taught you from God's holy word, they have fed you with the &s;incere milk of his word, that you may grow

<P>And now, my little friends, &s;uppo&s;e the great hu&s;bandman, after all that he has done for his vineyard, &s;hould come and find no fruit upon his vines and his fig-trees? Sad indeed, if he &s;hould come, year after year, &s;eeking fruit and finding none, after he has done &s;o much for

Young plants are aften removed, often in mercy taken away from the evil to come; take care that you are not removed in anger, becau&s;e you bear no fruit. It is &s;ad, indeed, to be mere cumberers of the ground; to live in the world without being good our|&s;elves; or doing good to tho&s;e around us; we root &s;uch plants out of our garden, and ca&s;t them among the weeds that are to be burnt.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS, Extracted from "an e&s;timate of the RELIGION Of the FASHIONABLE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>IT is &s;eriou&s;ly to be regretted, in an age like the pre&s;ent, re|markable for indifference in re|ligion and levity in manners, and which &s;tands &s;o much in need of lively patterns of firm and re&s;olute piety, that many who really are chri&s;tians on the &s;obere&s;t conviction, &s;hould not

appear more openly and deci|dedly on the &s;ide they have e&s;|pou&s;ed; that they a&s;&s;imilate &s;o very much with the manners of tho&s;e about them (which man|ners they yet &s;cruple not to di&s;|approve); and, in&s;tead of an avowed but prudent &s;teadfa&s;t|ne&s;s, which might draw over the others, appear evidently fearful of being thought preci&s;e and over-&s;crupulous; and ac|tually &s;eem to di&s;avow their right principles, by conce&s;&s;ions and accommodations not &s;trict|ly con&s;i&s;tent with them. They often &s;eem cautiou&s;ly afraid of <HI>doing too much,</HI> and <HI>going too far;</HI> and the dangerous plea,
<PB N="153" REF="047686_0153_10243EFE1E980BE8">
the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>living like other people,</HI> of <HI>being like the re&s;t of the world,</HI> and the propriety of <HI>not being particular,</HI> is brought as a rea&s;onable apology for a too yielding and indi&s;criminate comformity.</P>
<P>But, at a time when almo&s;t all are &s;inking into the prevail|ing corruption, how beautiful a rare, a &s;ingle integrity is, let the in&s;tances of Lot and Noah declare. And to tho&s;e with whom a poem is an higher au|thority than the Bible, let me recommend the mo&s;t animated picture of a right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">u &s;ingulari|ty that ever was delineated, in

<P>Few indeed of the more or|derly and decent have any ob|jection to that degree of reli|gion which is compatible with their general acceptance with others, or the full enjoyment of their own plea&s;ures. For a formal and ceremonious exer|ci&s;e of the outward duties of chri&s;tianity may not only be kept up without exciting cen|&s;ure,
<PB N="155" REF="047686_0155_1023E53E186B1170">
but will even procure a certain re&s;pect and confidence; and is not quite irreconcilable with a voluptuous and di&s;&s;ipat|ed life. So far many go; and fo far "as godline&s;s is profita|ble to the life that <HI>is,</HI>" it pa&s;&s;es without reproach.</P>
<P>But as &s;oon as men begin to con&s;ider religious exerci&s;es not as a decency, but a duty; not as a commutation for a &s;elf-denying life, but as a means to promote a holy temper, and a virtuous conduct: as &s;oon as they feel di&s;po&s;ed to carry the effect of their devotion into their daily life: as &s;oon as their principles di&s;cover them&s;elves,
<PB N="156" REF="047686_0156_10243EED080B5380">
by leading them to withdraw from tho&s;e &s;cenes, and ab&s;tain from tho&s;e actions, in which the gay place their &s;upreme happine&s;s as &s;oon as &s;omething is to be <HI>done,</HI> and &s;omething is to be <HI>parted with;</HI> then the world begins to take offence, and to &s;tigmatize the <HI>activity</HI> of that piety, which had been commended as long as it re|mained <HI>inoperative,</HI> and had only evaporated in <HI>words.</HI></P>
<P>But when religion, like the vital principles, takes its &s;eat in the heart, and &s;ends out &s;up|plies of life and heat to every part; diffu&s;es motion, &s;oul, and vigour, through the whole

circulation; and informs and animates the whole man: when it operates on the practice, influences the conver&s;ation, breaks out into a lively zeal for the honour of God, and the be&s;t intere&s;ts of mankind: then the &s;incerity, or the under|&s;tanding, of that per&s;on will become que&s;tionable: and it mu&s;t be owing to a very fortu|nate combination of circum|&s;tances indeed, if he can at once pre&s;erve the character of parts and piety.</P>
<P>But it is a folly to talk of being too holy, too &s;trict, or too good. Where there hap|pens to appear &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ounda|tion

for the charge of enthu&s;i|a&s;m (as there are indeed too often in good people eccentri|cities which ju&s;tify the cen|&s;ure), we may depend upon it, that it proceeds from &s;ome de|fect in the judgment, and not from any exce&s;s in the piety; for in goodne&s;s there is no ex|ce&s;s: and it is as prepo&s;terous to &s;ay that any one is too good, or too pious, as that he is too wi&s;e, too &s;trong, or too heal|thy; &s;ince the highe&s;t point in all the&s;e is only the perfection of that quality which we ad|mired in a lower degree.

goodne&s;s. An ardent imagination may mi&s;lead a rightly turned heart; and a weak intellect may incline the be&s;t intentioned to a&s;cribe too much value to things of com|paratively &s;mall importance.
