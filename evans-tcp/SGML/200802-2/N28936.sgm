<P>SO general an appearance of affliction was never depicted here before. To &s;tand in this immen&s;e concour&s;e of fellow citizens, where every face is marked with &s;or|row, almo&s;t unmans the &s;peaker. Verily there is a great mourning here to-day, like the mourning of I&s;rael when MOSES died, and to improve the occa&s;ion let us turn to</P>
<Q><BIBL>EXODUS xi. 3.</BIBL>
&mdash;<HI>Moreover the man MOSES was very great in the land of Egypt, in the &s;ight of Pharoah's &s;ervants, and in the &s;ight of the people.</HI></Q>
<P>IT mu&s;t be a &s;olemn &s;ea&s;on, when a great peo|ple lament before the LORD, the death of tho&s;e, whom his infinite goodne&s;s hath made the in|&s;truments of their greate&s;t benefits. On &s;uch occa&s;ions the mind mu&s;t be impre&s;&s;ed with me &s;overeignty of GOD, and frailty of man in his be&s;t earthly e&s;tate; and a tender and re&s;pectful

remembrance of decea&s;ed virtues will open all hearts to a mutual condolence. All ble&s;&s;ings are from GOD, who upholds the civil &s;tate, girds the civil and military rulers of men, and keeps his church in peace and quietne&s;s, thro the in|fluence of his &s;ervants who fear his name.</P>
<P>The LORD hath &s;et his king upon his holy hill of Zion, who is the CREATOR, REDEEMER, and JUDGE of men. He is GOD forever on the throne in heaven, and thro the earth, and to fulfil his coun&s;els he works thro in&s;truments pre|pared by him&s;elf, and made worthy of acting in his name, and bearing the marks of a divine commi&s;&s;ion. There have been but few men in the world eminently great, and tho&s;e have, in general, been on the &s;ide of virtue. There have been many tyrants and de&s;troyers, for it requires only &s;mall talents to work ruin; but to build up, to ble&s;s, to humanize &s;ociety, to de|fend the oppre&s;&s;ed, to vindicate human liberty, and at the &s;ame time re&s;train licentiou&s;ne&s;s, is an arduous ta&s;k; where none but good men will be inclined to expo&s;e them&s;elves, and which none but great men are able to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>That we may on this occa&s;ion, honor the &s;u|preme Sovereign of the world, and duly e&s;ti|mate the public lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained, let us,</P>
<P N="1">1. Contemplate the providence of GOD in rai&s;ing up great and eminent men, and qualify|ing
<PB N="7" REF="038577_0005_101296549FDE6E98">
them for the good which they are appointed to do to mankind.</P>
<P>In the formation of &s;uch per&s;ons, there mu&s;t be a union of rare and great natural talents, with an eminent love of moral virtue. when|ever GOD hath a great work to do in the world, he forms in&s;truments fitted for the tru&s;t to be repo&s;ed in them, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of talents, guided by his providential care, and in&s;pired with a &s;pirit of under&s;tanding from him&s;elf, whereby they are enabled, whatever difficulties and oppo&s;ition may occur, to do the things determined for them.</P>
<P>We know that tho&s;e, who de&s;pi&s;e a &s;upreme providence, are prone to refer every remarkable thing, either to a certain blind nece&s;&s;ity of na|ture which they cannot de&s;cribe, or to the effects of accidental but uncommon genius; indeed like other fooli&s;h men who think them&s;elves to be wi&s;e, they have recour&s;e to any means which will hide the being, the holy perfections, and the providence of GOD. Herein infidels &s;how them&s;elves to be at an equal remove from piety, wi&s;dom and truth; and that they are as far from di&s;cerning in what the true greatne&s;s of a creature con&s;i&s;ts, as they are from being good and pious.</P>
<P>The ri&s;e of eminent and good men is one of the highe&s;t di&s;plays of a &s;upreme Providence,
<PB N="8" REF="038577_0006_101296577240AF60">
for they always appear at periods, when there is a work prepared for them to do, for the honor of GOD and the good of the world, and at no other times; &s;o that we may con&s;ider their for|mation and introduction to the &s;cenes of action, their good lives and their great actions, eviden|tial of a SUPREME BEING, of the &s;tability of his coun&s;els and the irre&s;i&s;tible energy of his government.</P>
<P>Divine wi&s;dom, in the provi&s;ion of means and in&s;truments, always hath regard to the magni|tude of the work that is to be done by them in the world, under the direction of his providence. To accompli&s;h a great work in the earth he mak|eth his own in&s;truments great, either thro un|common natural endowments, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a &s;e|ries of propitious providences; or by a &s;uper|natural aid evidencing their commi&s;&s;ion and the pre&s;ence of GOD with them in di&s;charging &s;ome important tru&s;t, or in both of tho&s;e ways at the &s;ame time. MOSES, the Father, Lawgiver, and Commander of I&s;rael was great, in the fight of I&s;rael his people, and in the fight of Pharaoh and his &s;ervants their enemies, both by uncom|mon natural endowments and by &s;upernatural aid. The FATHER of his Country, for who&s;e decea&s;e we mourn before the LORD this day, was made great in the fight of his people, and of all their enemies, by his eminent natural endow|ments, which GOD was plea&s;ed to aid by a &s;e|ries
<PB N="9" REF="038577_0007_1012965A5D709F00">
of propitious providences, for the &s;alvation and good government of his country.</P>
<P>When we &s;ee remarkable in&s;truments of prov|idence coming into action, it indicates an inter|e&s;ting period in that &s;cheme of divine coun&s;el, which will be forever unfolding; and when &s;uch in&s;truments of ble&s;&s;ing to mankind are with|drawn by the power which rai&s;ed them up, it be|comes cau&s;e for public mourning and fear; cau&s;e for mourning, for every good man will re|gret the departure of virtue from the earth; cau&s;e of fear, for we are told that the righteous are taken from the evil to come, and that while they live, GOD will &s;pare an ungrateful people from judgments, for their &s;akes.</P>
<P>When a MOSES, a CYRUS, and a WASHING|TON were brought on the &s;tage of action, it was to effect changes in the &s;tate of mankind, favor|able to religion and civil rights, which could not have been done, in the manner that divine coun|&s;el cho&s;e to execute, under the au&s;pices of com|mon characters, nor even of great men, as great|ne&s;s is u&s;ually e&s;timated in this imperfect world. The&s;e actors in the &s;cenes of the world, were &s;pecially rai&s;ed up, and guided by an infinite GOD, to atchieve things which will ever make them celebrated in the hi&s;tory of mankind and of the church.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="038577_0008_1012965E68F9E228">
Much honor is due to them as in&s;truments of Almighty goodne&s;s. Let their virtues&mdash;their love and friend&s;hip to human nature&mdash;their ju&s;tice&mdash;their firmne&s;s in holding the &s;word of the LORD&mdash;and their political eminence as rulers and lawgiv|ers; let the&s;e be admired and remain perpetual ex|amples to &s;uch as wi&s;h to be on GOD's &s;ide; but let the glory of fa&s;hioning them from the womb, of girding them to lead his armies, of in&s;piring them to give laws to nations or creating new commonwealths, and of enabling them to die great as they had lived; let the glory of the&s;e things be given to GOD.</P>
<P>It can be no glory to a man, either living or departed, to &s;ay that the great things he hath done for his country, either by his &s;word or &s;ceptre, were done without a divine aid; for all con&s;iderate per&s;ons would know it to be a fal&s;e eulogy. Even infidels, in the mid&s;t of their vain preten&s;ions, know there is a divine provi|dence; and in the profane words they utter on this &s;ubject, they &s;peak the wi&s;hes of their hearts&punc; and not the dictates of their con&s;ciences and of their better under&s;tandings. Such men are like actors in a farce, &s;aying that which they know to be untrue, and it is a fal&s;e complai&s;ance to &s;up|po&s;e they may be hone&s;t; for it is very evident they dare not tru&s;t their own hone&s;ty, when dan|ger and death approach them.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="038577_0009_101296613B98DDD0">
The highe&s;t honor which we can give to mor|tals, is to &s;ay, that the infinite Author of life, power and wi&s;dom, made them greater and more virtuous than other men, in&s;pired them with talents above their brethren, and filled them with a rare under&s;tanding, to do things for the glory of GOD and the good of mankind, which were not permitted to others.&mdash;Many have made a con&s;picuous figure for a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on and within national limits, who were neither great nor good; but death is written on the glory of &s;uch, by the pen of future hi&s;torians, nor is it their privilege to live in the affections of mankind, or to be held up as examples for forming the morals of the world. Their prai&s;e re&s;ted in adventitious circum&s;tances found in the corruption of courts, and an era of fal&s;e opinions, and was never &s;poken by plain and good men, who were not poi&s;oned by &s;en&s;uality and the expectations of un|principled ambition; but the merits of great and good men, are &s;een by per&s;ons of every de&s;crip|tion. The pea&s;ant de&s;cries them as &s;oon as the man of letters.&mdash;They are more admired by the virtuous yeomanry of a country, than by the gay circle who bow and flatter to make them|&s;elves noticed.</P>
<P>Such in&s;truments of GOD's goodne&s;s to men, have a divine impre&s;&s;ion on their character, &s;een by all virtuous people&mdash;all look to them as
<PB N="12" REF="038577_0010_10129662E8BBC3D0">
being, under GOD, fathers, defenders in war, and rulers in peace. Such was MOSES to the Hebrews, and &s;uch was WASHINGTON to us. If any expect me this day to draw his character with preci&s;ion, let me beg &s;uch to recollect that they are expecting an impo&s;&s;ibility, and that it is as much beyond me to do this as it is to be &s;uch a man as he was. All will allow, that he was formed by the providence of GOD, to walk in a path where other men cannot guide their &s;teps, and to be an eminent agent in the formation of a new empire, which is to be con&s;picuous in the future hi&s;tory of mankind; but what it is to be &s;uch an in&s;trument of the infinite Ruler, what divine energies meet in originally forming and providentially guiding, and how tho&s;e energies were con&s;ciou&s;ly felt and exerted by the recipi|ent, certainly is not for me to tell and for but few of mankind to conceive.</P>
<P>MOSES was formed to re&s;cue the ancient and ea&s;tern I&s;rael from bondage, and after they were re&s;cued to form their civil, military and reli|gious &s;tate, and be an in&s;trument of delivering the moral law to mankind in a new manner; and he was, in every re&s;pect, perfected for the office to which heaven de&s;igned him.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was formed to re&s;cue from bon|dage the modern and we&s;tern I&s;rael of the LORD, and after they were &s;aved from foreign enemies
<PB N="13" REF="038577_0011_101296674B4EA358">
by his &s;word, to &s;ave them, a &s;econd time, from de&s;truction by them&s;elves; from the mi&s;eries of anarchy; and to bring them into a &s;tate of government, whereby they might be pre|&s;erved from devouring one another, and be|ing devoured by the whole earth. The&s;e were great objects in the divine government, and worthy of that di&s;play of his &s;ufficiency, which was made in the provi&s;ion of in&s;truments. The glory of furni&s;hing protectors mu&s;t belong to GOD, and if the people who have been &s;aved are pious, they will prai&s;e him for the means of executing his mo&s;t gracious coun&s;el. The formation of great characters, for the good of mankind, is really an exhibition of GOD's providential efficiency, and is ob&s;erved by the pious as a di&s;play of him&s;elf, thro the in&s;trumen|tality of means made for his own glory. Their progre&s;s and their works thro life are the unfold|ing of his gracious coun&s;els, and their exit from time is to be marked as a temporary withdrawment of the remarkable energies of divine providence, in favor of tho&s;e who have been his care. For this rea&s;on, the whole congregation of I&s;rael mourn|ed thirty days when MOSES died; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on the American I&s;rael mourn when WASHINGTON dies.</P>
<P>We are not to think, that the LORD can give coun&s;el and pre&s;erve, only by tho&s;e who have been great in&s;truments of &s;alvation; nor are we
<PB N="14" REF="038577_0012_10129668DCF3A6D0">
to di&s;tru&s;t a future divine care; or to &s;uppo&s;e that he will not rai&s;e up in&s;truments according to the day and exigencies in which they have to act; but &s;till the withdrawment of &s;o great a benefactor, under exi&s;ting circum&s;tances, is to be devoutly and penitentially noticed as a divine frown; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider the evidence that he was remarkably formed to be the father and deliverer of his country. None who have con&s;idered the American revolution with its &s;ub|&s;equent events and the &s;tate of our country, can deny this; nor can they doubt the evidence of a mo&s;t wonderful interpo&s;ition of heaven, in the formation and continuance of one &s;o fitted to &s;up|ply our great national wants.</P>
<P N="2">2. There are two kinds of evidence by which great and good men are clearly commi&s;&s;ioned from on high, to act a con&s;picuous part, under GOD, in his government of the world. The fir&s;t is, &s;upernatural works which evidence them to be immediate organs of divine power and truth &s;peaking to men. The &s;econd, is uncom|mon natural talents and moral integrity, accom|panied with fit opportunities for their exertion. In the ca&s;e of MOSES, both the&s;e evidences were united to an&s;wer particular purpo&s;es in the divine government of the world, at that period of time.</P>
<P>His natural abilities and moral attainments were great, and continued to the end of his life;
<PB N="15" REF="038577_0013_1012966BB7B7CB40">
for when he died an old man, his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. He was &s;kill|ed in the learning of the world, and e&s;pecially in the wi&s;dom of that people, whom he was de|&s;igned by the power of GOD to overcome. By a &s;pecial providence, he was brought into a &s;tate of power and riches, and reputedly the &s;on of Pharaoh's daughter, that having had an experi|mental ta&s;te of worldly wealth and plea&s;ure, and found its vanity compared with the delights of moral and pious integrity, he might not be brib|ed from his duty by any worldly overture, when he came to a &s;tate of confidential tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Whoever reads his hi&s;tory as a lawgiver and military leader, con&s;idering the condition of the world in tho&s;e ages when he acted, mu&s;t be con|vinced that he was a great and good man, even apart from tho&s;e &s;upernatural aids, which he re|ceived to evidence his appointment and authority from heaven, and that he had that uncommon genius and &s;elf-command which all can &s;ee and admire, but only a rare few can imitate in the &s;cience and practice of legi&s;lation and govern|ment.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, he was a good man, fearing the provi|dence and adoring the holine&s;s of the GOD of I&s;rael. If he had not been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of religious rectitude; neither great natural talents, nor ac|quired attainments, nor &s;upernatural aid could
<PB N="16" REF="038577_0014_1012966D50559C30">
have given him &s;o venerable an appearance in the eyes of his people, and &s;anctified their judg|ment in the opinion of all po&s;terity. At the head of the LORD's I&s;rael he was a meek man, and humble in the mid&s;t of greatne&s;s. He e&s;|teemed him&s;elf one among many brethren and citizens, and relying on a divine providence to lead him and the people to whom his life was con&s;ecrated, he was never for&s;aken, but witne&s;&s;|ed a gracious pre&s;ence thro his whole admini&s;|tration.</P>
<P>To the evidence that he was divinely commi&s;|&s;ioned, which aro&s;e from great natural talents and uncommon piety, we may add the &s;upernat|ural works he was enabled to perform, and the revelations which were made to him. To learn the rea&s;on, why the&s;e additional and great evi|dences of the divine pre&s;ence were given to MO|SES, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the extent of his commi&s;|&s;ion. The flood had once clean&s;ed the world of idolatry, but at the time of this great prophet, the nations in their new di&s;per&s;ion had forgotten the LORD, and the wor&s;hip of idols had become almo&s;t univer&s;al. The people of I&s;rael, who were de&s;cendents of Abraham, were de&s;igned to be depo&s;itaries of a written law of religion, and the works of providence, which regarded them and their enemies, were intended to &s;how that their LORD JEHOVAH, was the GOD of the whole earth.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="038577_0015_10129672DD30FDF0">
The&s;e intentions of heaven were foretold to their fathers, and to accompli&s;h the divine prom|i&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary a character like MOSES &s;hould be rai&s;ed up, who, being mighty in word and deed, &s;hould confound the idolizing nations, &s;o that the world might look upon him and &s;ee that his LORD was the true GOD. Al&s;o, that no other ruler of men had been like unto him, in all the &s;igns and wonders which he was &s;ent to do, and in all that mighty hand and all that terror which he &s;hewed in the fight of I&s;rael and their enemies. This was the rea&s;on for a &s;upernatural evidence of his divine commi&s;&s;ion being added to tho&s;e rare talents and piety, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in com|mon with other great and good men, who were made by GOD, in their re&s;pective times, to honor his name and ble&s;s mankind.</P>
<P N="3">3. At other times GOD hath rai&s;ed up his eminent &s;ervants and &s;ent them abroad into the world, without this &s;upernatural evidence of their commi&s;&s;ion from him; and indeed this hath been his u&s;ual manner in providential govern|ment. But in all &s;uch ca&s;es, there hath been to the con&s;iderate ob&s;erver, &s;ufficient notices of GOD's &s;pecial providence, in forming his in&s;tru|ments and guiding and making them &s;ucce&s;sful in his hand, to execute the coun&s;els of his will. The production of rare talents at a time when they are needed to execute the benevolent purpo&s;es of
<PB N="18" REF="038577_0016_101296746FB19070">
Providence, and preparing the way for their ex|ertion, is a &s;ufficient evidence that GOD is with the actor. In this part of my di&s;cour&s;e I &s;hall pa&s;s over many in&s;tances of the truth of this doctrine&mdash;many eventful epochs in the hi&s;tory of the world and the church&mdash;many great charac|ters in the cabinet, in the temple of the LORD and in the field, who were rai&s;ed by the almighty providence of GOD, at fit times to execute his pre-determined coun&s;els for the benefit of men; and I &s;hall come down to our own times and the occa&s;ion which hath gathered us before the LORD, the death of General WASHINGTON. Among modern characters there hath been none to whom the words of our text would more per|tinently apply. He was very great, both in the &s;ight of his own people, and in the &s;ight of all their enemies; nor at the time of his death, was his eye dim, nor his natural force abated. As thro his life, &s;o at the time of his death, circum|&s;tances &s;eem to have been &s;pecially ordered by di|vine providence to hide human weakne&s;s, and make him an extraordinary example to men, in fortitude and in all the moral virtues. The com|mon age of man had not in him, impaired a great under&s;tanding, nor any of tho&s;e energies which decide in the cabinet or execute in the field.</P>
<P>THIS GREAT MAN WAS AN AMERICAN BY BIRTH, and the country rai&s;ed by his &s;word into
<PB N="19" REF="038577_0017_1012967748325BB0">
independence, and which he afterwards govern|ed as &s;upreme magi&s;trate, gave him the political and moral &s;entiments, which made him illu&s;tri|ous in &s;cenes of action. He early commenced the life of a &s;oldier, and while a young officer, Monongahela witne&s;&s;ed, and Britons owned the talents of the young American, in &s;aving from &s;laughter the remains of an army &s;ufficiently humbled by &s;avage fury and policy. Even, at that time, the talents of the youth cau&s;ed a pre|diction that he would be the &s;aviour of his coun|try, but little was it conjectured how the pre|diction would be fulfilled.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a note to a &s;ermon preached by that eminent &s;ervant of CHRIST, Pre&s;ident DAVIES, before Capt. Overton's independent company of volunteers, rai&s;ed in Hanover county, Virginia, Aug. 17, 1755, entitled, "<HI>Religion and Patrioti&s;m the con&s;tituents of a good &s;oldier,</HI>" as an example of this character, the author &s;ays, <Q>As a remarkable in&s;tance of this, I may point out to the public that heroic youth, Col.

The man WASHINGTON was great in his youth, and prepared by almighty Providence to protect the American &s;tate and church.</NOTE></P>
<P>It certainly cannot be expected of me, on this occa&s;ion, particularly to recite the events which have made him beloved by his country, and owned as their pre&s;erver, under the providence of GOD, who girded him for the field, and filled him with the &s;pirit of under&s;tanding in all na|tional concerns. To make &s;uch a recital requires all the volumes, which have been, and the more

numerous ones which will be written on this great &s;ubject.&mdash;It mu&s;t &s;uffice for me to &s;ay, that General WASHINGTON was the point of &s;trength around whom the political fathers and the mili|tary defenders of this country have rallied, and where they repo&s;ed their earthly confidence, from the moment a revolution was contemplated, as the only po&s;&s;ible means of avoiding foreign oppre&s;&s;ion, down to the pre&s;ent time. In a peri|od of almo&s;t thirty years, we have &s;een many changes, many dangers from within and without, from foreign artifice and internal folly and caprice; and during the whole of this term, WASHINGTON has been the name, which would rai&s;e a martial &s;pirit and point its energies by the waving of his &s;word; or &s;ooth the multitude to peace, quiet|etne&s;s and &s;ubordination, as his voice and pen advi&s;ed.&mdash;The&s;e influential energies of the man, were not confined to the uninformed multitude only; for they had as much impre&s;&s;ion on delib|erating &s;enates, as on armed &s;quadrons;&mdash;he was as much the angel of peace as of war;&mdash;as much re&s;pected, as deeply reverenced in the po|litical cabinet for a luminous coolne&s;s of di&s;po&s;i|tion, whereby party jealou&s;y became enlighten|ed and a&s;hamed of it&s;elf, as he was for a cool|ne&s;s of command, in the dreadful moment, when empires hung &s;u&s;pended on the fate of bat|tle.&mdash;His opinions became the opinions of the public body, and every man was plea&s;ed with him&s;elf when he found he thought like WASH|INGTON.</P>

Our revolutionary war began &s;uddenly, when the country was wholly unorganized in every department, that was nece&s;&s;ary to maintain and enjoy an independent &s;tate among the nations. There was pa&s;&s;ion enough, among all orders of men; but pa&s;&s;ion can endure only for a mo|ment, and there is no &s;afety in its dictates.</P>
<P>It was General WASHINGTON who came cool|ly to the &s;cene of action, under a mighty impre&s;|&s;ion of the greatne&s;s of the labor to which he had permitted him&s;elf to be proclaimed, and for which, thro the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of GOD, he was found able both in word and in deed. He ordained &s;y&s;tem&mdash;induced regularity&mdash;was found capable of reducing a half-armed multitude to military bravery and obedience, and for a long time had apparently to create the means, from day to day, by which he defended his country.</P>
<P>It &s;ince appears, that while doing this in camp, his pen was the organ of wi&s;dom and of a per|&s;evering firmne&s;s to the councils of the union and of the &s;everal &s;tates; and that the great men, who &s;hone like &s;tars of the fir&s;t magni|tude, in the &s;everal parts of the American hem|i&s;phere where GOD had placed them, &s;hone brighter for their communication with him.&mdash;His name &s;oon became reverenced by our enemies, and wherever they heard of him, they joined the apprehen&s;ion of a &s;enate and ho&s;t. His name and the fear of him, and of

a few tried men and &s;oldiers, who were the heads of military departments and in the line of ac|tual &s;ervice, often &s;hielded the country again&s;t mighty ho&s;ts, and finally &s;aved the common|wealth and made it independent.</P>
<P>The fame even of hi&s;torians will be eternized, in relating how he with the band of his brother officers, and a patient, per&s;evering, gallant army under them, vindicated the foundation of A|merican empire, and then retired into the cla&s;s of peaceful citizens, to eat the hard-earned, and in many in&s;tances, &s;canty bread of repo&s;e.</P>
<P>General WASHINGTON was formed and pla|ced, in every re&s;pect, by the hand of Providence to perform the duty determined for him by infi|nite wi&s;dom. He was &s;killed, by an early edu|cation, in human &s;cience. He expre&s;&s;ed on all fit occa&s;ions, a reverence of GOD, and his gov|erning providence in all the events of individual life and of empire, and re&s;orted to the throne of grace and called on tho&s;e around him to do the &s;ame when danger threatened, or when &s;uc|ce&s;s claimed his prai&s;e. He had a luminous un|der&s;tanding&mdash;a mind above the ruffle of pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;was as far from the ga&s;conade of mock hero|i&s;m as he was from a &s;ervile fear of men and dan|ger. Nothing was too &s;mall to call his attention, if it regarded the public good; at the &s;ame time he was naturally formed to look on great objects,
<PB N="23" REF="038577_0021_101296828ACEB940">
and &s;urvey in one comprehen&s;ive view, an em|pire in all its civil and military intere&s;ts.&mdash;He &s;eemed intuitively to look thro men, and know the extent of their capacities to under&s;tand, and their abilities for exertion, and from this it came that the heads of departments thro his advice, were filled in general with &s;uch extraordinary in|tegrity and talents for exertion; and this was one circum&s;tance which e&s;&s;entially conduced to American triumph.&mdash;If the created honors, which are given by crowns and royal nations could have bribed him, many a time he would have been &s;tolen from us; but he e&s;teemed it the greate&s;t honor, to be the defence of a free peo|ple. American freedom, and independence were written on his heart, and he importunately breath|ed out a de&s;ire for them in all his devotions to heaven. Under the au&s;pices of this great war|rior, who was formed by the providence of GOD to defend his country, the war was ended, and America ranked among the nations. He who might have been a monarch, retired to his own Vernon, unclothed of all authority, to enjoy the bli&s;s of being a free private citizen. This was a &s;trange &s;ight, and gave a new triumph to human virtue&mdash;a triumph that hath never been exceeded in the hi&s;tory of the world, except it was by his &s;econd rece&s;s, which was from the pre&s;idency of the United States.</P>
<P>After the revolutionary war was ended, ex|perience &s;oon taught that freedom cannot &s;ub|&s;i&s;t

The impre&s;&s;ive feelings of danger, again led the peo|ple to a&s;k the aid of General WASHINGTON, and he greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted in forming a con&s;titution which we hope will be perpetual. By the voice of the people, he became once and again the Pre&s;ident of the union, and continued thus un|til, in his opinion, the complete organization of the civil &s;tate, permitted him to retire a &s;econd time into private life, giving in all re&s;pects a new example to men and the world, that a virtu|ous mind finds its highe&s;t delights, in the enjoy|ments of &s;olitude and in beholding others happy.</P>
<P>A third time danger menaced his country&mdash;a third time his country called&mdash;he heard his fel|low-citizens and his children and took his &s;word, and bid them tru&s;t in GOD, and keep his laws, and the ordinances of a good government and they &s;hould be &s;afe.

<HEAD>SKETCHES OF THE LIFE OF GENERAL WASHINGTON.</HEAD>
<P>GEORGE WASHINGTON was born on the 11th of February A. D. 1732 O. S. His per&s;on was con&s;idera|bly above the middle &s;ize, but of a dignified and graceful form. His countenance exhibited &s;trong marks of that fortitude and wi&s;dom which always &s;hone in his character; and at once &s;poke the hero and the man. At an early period of life, he was thought worthy of the confidence of his native &s;tate, and while only twenty-one years of age was, at his own reque&s;t, &s;ent on a dif|ficult and important mi&s;&s;ion. During the di&s;pute which originat|ed the war which concluded in 1763, the French, pretending to claim the territory in the vicinity of the river Ohio&punc; committed many acts of ho&s;tility and violence upon the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects by erecting forts in their dominions, and &s;eizing their per&s;ons and &s;ending them pri&s;oners to Canada. Complaints being made to the governor of Virginia of the&s;e outrages, he determined to &s;end &s;ome &s;uitable per&s;on to the French commandant near the Ohio, to demand of him the rea&s;on of his conduct&punc; and in&s;i&s;t upon his evacuating the fort lately built in that quarter. Gene|ral WASHINGTON, then being a major, offered his &s;ervice, which was thankfully accepted. The di&s;tance to be travelled was more than 400 miles, and one half of the rout lay through a wilderne&s;s, inhabited only by &s;avages. Taking provi&s;ion on his back, he &s;at out, attended by a &s;ingle companion. When he arrived and delivered his me&s;&s;age, the officer refu&s;ed to comply with the demand, and claimed the whole country as belonging to the king his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Ohio company could not brook this di&s;appointment of their hopes, and prevailed on the Briti&s;h government to in&s;truct the colonies to oppo&s;e with arms the&s;e encroachments on their territory. In the year 1754 Virginia &s;ent Col. WASHINGTON with the command of 300 men towards the Ohio. An en|gagement between them and a party of the French took place, in which the latter were defeated. In con&s;equence of this event, the commandant of the French marched again&s;t Col. WASH|INGTON with 900 men, partly Indians, and attacked him. He made a brave defence, behind a &s;mall unfini&s;hed entrenchment, which he called fort Nece&s;&s;ity, and obliged the French officer to grant him honorable terms of capitulation.</P>
<P>The ho&s;tile conduct of the French produced, both in England and America, the re&s;olution of driving them out of the whole territory claimed by the Engli&s;h. General Braddock was ac|cordingly ordered from Ireland to Virginia with two regiments, and was there joined by as many Americans as made in the whole 2200 men. General Braddock was a brave man, but with a &s;upercilious contempt of the Americans, he greatly &s;lighted the Virginia officers and men. Col. WASHINGTON who then com|manded
<PB N="28" REF="038577_0026_1012969102982B58">
the Virginia troops, begged his permi&s;&s;ion to march be|fore him and with the Americans, who were acquainted with that kind of &s;ervice, &s;cour the woods; but was refu&s;ed. The General pu&s;hed on incautiou&s;ly with 1400 men, and fell into an ambu&s;|cade of French and Indians, by whom he was defeated and mor|tally wounded on the 9th day of June 1755. The Briti&s;h were thrown into confu&s;ion, but the Americans more accu&s;tomed to &s;avage warfare, were not much di&s;concerted. They contin|ued unbroken under Col. WASHINGTON, and by covering the retreat of the Briti&s;h, prevented their being entirely cut off. Ever &s;ince this battle was fought, General WASHINGTON has had the credit of &s;aving the remains of that unfortunate corps by his ma&s;terly addre&s;s and good conduct.</P>
<P>After the peace of Paris, in 1763, Gen. WASHINGTON re|tired to his e&s;tate, where with great indu&s;try and &s;ucce&s;s he pur|&s;ued the arts of peace. Since this time there &s;eems to be no hi&s;|torical monument of his public life until he was returned a dele|gate from the &s;tate of Virginia to the memorable congre&s;s of 1774. This venerable band of patriots and &s;tate&s;men might glory in reckoning among their number the &s;age and hero of America.</P>
<P>On the 15th day of June 1775, he was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en, by the continental congre&s;s, to fill the important and dangerous &s;tation of commander in chief of the forces rai&s;ed, or to be rai&s;ed for the defence of American Liberty. His election pre|&s;ented the uncommon &s;pectacle of a man rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t honors his country could be&s;tow, without exciting either compe|tition or envy. On the day following, the Pre&s;ident of Con|gre&s;s announced to General WASHINGTON his appointment; to which he, &s;tanding in his place, replied&mdash;</P>

<P>Though I am truly &s;en&s;ible of the high honor done me in this appointment, yet I feel great di&s;tre&s;s from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that my abilities and military experience may not be equal to the exten&s;ive and important tru&s;t: however, as the Congre&s;s de&s;ire it, I will enter upon the momentous duty, and exert every power I po&s;&s;e&s;s in their &s;ervice, and for &s;upport of the glorious cau&s;e. I beg they will accept my mo&s;t cordial thanks for this di&s;tin|gui&s;hed te&s;timony of their approbation.</P>
<P>But le&s;t &s;ome unlucky event &s;hould happen unfavorable to my reputation, I beg it may be remembered by every gentleman in the room, that I this day declare with the utmo&s;t &s;incerity, I do not think my&s;elf equal to the command I am honored with.</P>
<P>As to pay, &s;ir, I beg leave to a&s;&s;ure the Congre&s;s, that as no pecuniary con&s;ideration could have tempted me to accept this arduous employment, at the expen&s;e of my dome&s;tic ea&s;e and happine&s;s, I do not wi&s;h to make any profit from it.

which is included within the time of the American war, would require a detail of all the principal events which took place in that hard &s;truggle for liberty, and would greatly exceed the limits of the&s;e &s;ketches. The evacuation of Bo&s;ton, the ma&s;|terly retreat from Long-I&s;land and New-York, cro&s;&s;ing the North river and the retreat through New-Jer&s;ey, the brilliant coup-de-main at Trenton, the more &s;plendid affair at Prince-town, the battle of Germantown, the battle of Monmouth, the capture of Stoney-point, the&s;e are a few of the events which were directed by his wi&s;dom, or effected by his arm; and are but re&s;ting places in his glorious career through this bloody con|flict. During the progre&s;s of the war the confidence of the Congre&s;s was, on many occa&s;ions, manife&s;ted to him, by votes of thanks and applau&s;e, and by medals ordered to be pre&s;ented to him in commemoration of particular in&s;tances of heroi&s;m and general&s;hip. So great indeed was their tru&s;t in his abilities and virtue, that from time to time they increa&s;ed his powers as com|mander in chief until he was little le&s;s than univer&s;al dictator.&mdash;In no in&s;tance can he be accu&s;ed of abu&s;ing tho&s;e powers; and the time arriving when they were no longer nece&s;&s;ary for the pub|lic good, he cheerfully re&s;igned them.</P>
<P>The event which fini&s;hed the American war and added the la&s;t wreath to the brow of WASHINGTON, was the capture of Lord Cornwallis with 7000 Briti&s;h troops, at Yorktown in the month of October 1781. This &s;ucce&s;s was gained by the im|mediate valor of the combined troops of America and France; but the wi&s;dom of the plan and energy of the execution mu&s;t be attributed to him. On this triumphant occa&s;ion his heart was filled with joy and gratitude to heaven for his wonderful &s;ucce&s;s. A &s;hort extract from his orders on this great day, will evince that amid&s;t all his pro&s;perity, he was not unmindful of that GOD who&s;e directing hand had pointed out to him the path of glory. "Divine &s;ervice &s;hall be performed to-morrow in all the brigades and divi&s;ions. The commander in chief, recommends that all the troops that are not upon duty, do a&s;&s;i&s;t at it with a &s;erious de|portment and that &s;en&s;ibility of heart, which the recollection of the &s;urpri&s;ing and particular interpo&s;ition of Divine Providence in our favor claims."</P>
<P>Every one knows that towards the clo&s;e of the war our troops were unpaid and the credit of the United States at its lowe&s;t ebb. At this period an attempt was made to inflame the minds of the officers and &s;oldiers, by a &s;editious and artful publication, inviting them while they had arms in their hands, to redre&s;s their own grievances. Perhaps in no period of the war was the con|duct of the commander in chief, &s;o politic, &s;o magnanimous, &s;o worthy of him&s;elf, as at this intere&s;ting and alarming cri&s;is. No &s;ooner were the&s;e mutinous and inflammatory papers &s;cattered through the camp; than the General convened the officers to|gether, and in a &s;peech well calculated to calm their minds, he
<PB N="30" REF="038577_0028_101296969FF53A88">
pledged him&s;elf to u&s;e all his faculties and influence in their fa|vour, and urged them to rely on the future ju&s;tice of their coun|try. He conjured them "as they valued their honor, as they re&s;pected the rights of humanity and as they regarded the mili|tary and national character of America, to expre&s;s their utmo&s;t dete&s;tation of the man, who was attempting to open the flood|gates of civil di&s;cord, and deluge their ri&s;ing empire with blood." His attempt was &s;ucce&s;sful; and the officers and &s;oldiers return|ed to their duty and con&s;ented to wait for the tardy ju&s;tice of their country.</P>
<P>At the return of peace, General WASHINGTON repaired to Annapolis, where Congre&s;s was in &s;e&s;&s;ion, for the purpo&s;e of re&s;igning his command. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">3d day of December 1783, was fixed for the ceremony of his re&s;ignation.

<P>From this time General WASHINGTON re&s;ided at his retreat at Mount Vernon, until the deranged &s;tate of our public affairs, and the total inefficiency of our confederation, had convinced the leading characters of our nation that a new form of government was nece&s;&s;ary. At this time a convention was called, which met in Philadelphia in the year 1787.

<P>In the year 1789, he was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en Pre&s;ident of the United States. No &s;ooner was he informed that he was again called to exchange his happy retirement for the &s;tormy &s;cenes of public life, than he prepared to meet the wi&s;hes of his country; and in a few days arrived at New-York. Here he accepted his appointment of Pre&s;ident of the United States, and informed both hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, that he &s;hould recline any compen&s;a|tion for his &s;ervices&mdash;in the following manner; "When I was fir&s;t honored with a call into the &s;ervice of my country, then on the eve of an arduous &s;truggle for its liberties, the light in which I contemplated my duty required that I &s;hould renounce every pe|cuniary compen&s;ation. From this re&s;olution I have in no in|&s;tance departed. And being &s;till under the impre&s;&s;ions which produced it, I mu&s;t decline as inapplicable to my&s;elf, any &s;hare in the per&s;onal emoluments which may be indi&s;pen&s;ably included in a permanent provi&s;ion for the executive department; and mu&s;t accordingly pray that pecuniary e&s;timates for the &s;tation in which I am placed, may, during my continuance in it, be limited to &s;uch actual expenditures, as the public good may be thought to require."</P>
<P>In the year 1793 the time for which his fir&s;t appointment was made being expired, he was again elected; and having a &s;econd time officiated in the character of Pre&s;ident of the United States, he cho&s;e to retire from the public &s;cene and &s;pend the remainder of his days in rural quiet and dome&s;tic tranquillity. He pub|li&s;hed his intention in an addre&s;s to the people of the United States, which, while it breathes the pure &s;pirit of benevolence and patrioti&s;m, recommends to them in the mo&s;t winning and im|pre&s;&s;ive language the cau&s;e of virtue and religion.</P>
<P>After his farewel for a &s;econd time, to all public honors, he retired to his favorite &s;eat at Mount Vernon, where he re&s;ided in the character of a private citizen, until the pro&s;pect of a rupture with France turned the eyes of the government towards him as their only refuge during the impending &s;torm. His cheerful acqui|e&s;cence in accepting the office of Lieutenant-General of the Amer|ican forces, at a time when his age and former &s;ervices might have ju&s;tified a refu&s;al, will long be remembered with &s;entiments of affection and gratitude, by a generous people.</P>
