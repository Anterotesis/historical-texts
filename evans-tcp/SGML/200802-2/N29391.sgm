<P>SO Mo&s;es the &s;ervant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab&mdash;And the children of I&s;rael wept for Mo&s;es in the plains of Moab thirty days&mdash;And there aro&s;e not a pro|phet &s;ince in I&s;rael like unto Mo&s;es.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is well known to tho&s;e of my hearers, who have ac|cu&s;tomed them&s;elves to attend the public admini&s;tration<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Sanctuary, that it has not been my cu&s;tom; nor do I approve of the practice of introducing political &s;ubjects in the hou&s;e of God, on the Lord's Day: when &s;ubjects of &s;upreme and divine importance may be furni&s;hed, for greater edification to the immortal mind. Nor do I de|&s;ign to introduce them upon this occa&s;ion, farther than their connexion, with the character of a great and good man, may require.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="039139_0004_1013EB92D700EE68">SHOULD I be entirely &s;ilent at this time, I might, and perhaps ju&s;tly, be con&s;idered in&s;en&s;ible of the obligations, which we owe one to another, wanting in re&s;pect to a great and illu&s;trious character, and ungrateful to the Governor of the Univer&s;e, who alone rai&s;es up &s;aviours and deliverers for his people.</P>
<P>THEN let me drop a tear, grateful to the memory of the man, who was favored of his God, and honorable in the &s;ight of all the people; tho it be lo&s;t among the tears of thou&s;ands, who&s;e hearts may be touched, with more pungent &s;orrow.</P>
<P>THE world, my Brethren, hath in every age, produ|ced characters celebrated by fame: Conquerors, Tyrants, Philo&s;ophers or Lawgivers. But how rarely have the characters of the humane conqueror, a humble lawgiver, a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive citizen, and a meek and humble chri&s;tian been united in one man. When Tyrants fall, they are to be pityed, when wi&s;e Legi&s;lators, they are to be re|gretted: But when men of this excellent combination of character, we, like the children of I&s;rael, &s;hould weep, or like the devout men who carried Stephen to his buri|al, make great lamentation over him.</P>
<P>THE character now de&s;cribed, and the duty to be practi&s;ed, at the departure of &s;uch a man, if not fully ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the pa&s;&s;age under con&s;ideration, may be farther illu&s;trated under the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE character of Mo&s;es as hereafter expre&s;&s;ed, "And there aro&s;e not a prophet &s;ince in I&s;rael like unto Mo&s;es."</P>
<P N="2">II. THAT human greatne&s;s and excellency afford no exemption from Death.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="5" REF="039139_0005_1013EB946ADD82C0">III. THE duty of a people when characters eminent|ly u&s;eful are removed.</P>
<P>IN pur&s;uance of this plan we are in the</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t place, To con&s;ider the Character of Mo&s;es. Here we may ob&s;erve, many important circum&s;tances coinci|ded to render it truly illu&s;trious. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed naturally of a &s;ound penetrating mind, the foundation, and ju&s;t prelude of his future greatne&s;s. Brought up in an empire, where the arts and &s;ciences, then known, flouri&s;hed to a great degree of perfection; and indulged with all the privile|ges and advantages, which, &s;uch a high &s;tate of national improvement, could afford. And, whatever might be the &s;y&s;tem or principles, by which, the nation was gov|erned, Mo&s;es mu&s;t have been acquainted with them all. To which may be added, an opportunity of acquiring all the embelli&s;hments of the Egyptian Court.</P>
<P>THIS high &s;tate of refinement, in addition to his meek and placid temper, was, but truly, calculated to teach his heart to feel another's woe. To animate his &s;oul with &s;trong de&s;ires to be the deliverer of his brethren, from the Egyptian yoke.</P>
<P>NOW &s;uffer me, for a moment, to lead your minds to con&s;ider the &s;tate of God's covenant people.&mdash;From the days of Jo&s;eph, God's people I&s;rael, gradually, &s;unk into a &s;tate of &s;lavery.&mdash;Having pre&s;erved them&s;elves a di&s;tinct people, living within the juri&s;diction of the E|gyptian Court, and, under the ble&s;&s;ing of divine provi|dence, becoming very numerous; the jealou&s;y of an im|perious haughty nation was ea&s;ily excited.&mdash;Pride, the fo&s;ter parent of luxury and extravagance, de&s;ires un|lawful means for its gratifications, and often leads to cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion. The mo&s;t &s;uitable means, now to be devi&s;ed, for its gratification, and the
<PB N="6" REF="039139_0006_1013EB9693938538">
&s;ubjection of this infant nation, were, to lay them under contribution. And to augment that tribute from time to time, till they &s;hould become complete &s;laves and va&s;|&s;als. &mdash;But, however this might enrich her coffers, as it proved in&s;ufficient to check the progre&s;s of their growing numbers, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to murder and de&s;truction. &mdash;Thus reduced to the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and poverty, the &s;ituation of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael was truly helple&s;s, defence|le&s;s and forlorn.</P>
<P>AT this critical moment, God rai&s;ed up a deliverer for his people.</P>
<P>HERE let us admire the power and wi&s;dom of that God, under the &s;uperintendency of who&s;e providence all things &s;ub&s;i&s;t; who alike feeds the oppre&s;&s;or and the op|pre&s;&s;ed: Yet a&s;&s;uredly, &s;ees the affliction of his people, hears the cries of the oppre&s;&s;ed, and comes down to de|liver them from their enemies with a mighty hand and with a &s;tretched out arm.&mdash;Nor are the in&s;truments which he rai&s;es up and u&s;es for affecting the great purpo&s;e of his providental Government, le&s;s worthy, honorable or de&s;erving, for having received their power and com|mi&s;&s;ion from God.</P>
<P>THO' the miraculous power of God wonderfully inter|po&s;ed, yet the firmne&s;s and intrepidity of Mo&s;es was highly expre&s;&s;ed in his conduct at the Egyptian Court. The imperiou&s;ne&s;s and power of the Egyptians, the pov|erty, fears and prejudices of the I&s;raelites, were circum|&s;tances, contributing equally to evince his valour and wi&s;|dom. &mdash;I need not particularize the in&s;tances of his wi&s;|dom and valour, at the Red &s;ea, at the conque&s;t of Ame|lek, at Sinai, at Taberah, at Zin and Median.</P>
<P>NOR was his character le&s;s con&s;picuous as a <HI>legi&s;lator,</HI> than a leader of the ho&s;t. No &s;ooner had he brought the
<PB N="7" REF="039139_0007_1013EB98E5BAE3C8">
people through the red &s;ea, and placed them in &s;ome de|gree of &s;afety, than he became intent upon the admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice. By the advice of Jethro his father in-law, he e&s;tabli&s;hed a civil government, that ju&s;tice might be more perfectly admini&s;tered, long and de&s;ervedly held in high e&s;teem. The method apparently met the divine approbation. Very &s;oon, <HI>the Governor of the Univer&s;e</HI> called Mo&s;es to the top of Sinai, and committed to him <HI>that perfect code of moral precepts,</HI> which he afterwards delivered to the children of I&s;rael. The&s;e, <HI>the great pole Star of Legi&s;lation,</HI> are of equal importance to direct the due execution of ju&s;t and equitable laws, by proper con|&s;tituted authorities. Mo&s;es was the head of Legi&s;lative and Executive authorities, and from this period was in|dulged with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and mo&s;t frequent com|munications from the Divine pre&s;ence. Whom, ac|cording to the &s;acred hi&s;torian, <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>knew face to face.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE <HI>Legi&s;lative</HI> and <HI>Military talents</HI> made him fa|mous, <HI>meekne&s;s</HI> and the <HI>Chri&s;tian graces</HI> rendered him ami|able. However, in the&s;e and many others, he might be a type of the great CAPTAIN <HI>of our &s;alvation,</HI> yet his character as a man was truly de&s;erving.</P>
<P>THOUGH God rai&s;ed up <HI>Jo&s;huas</HI> to lead his ho&s;ts, and <HI>Samuels</HI> to judge his people, yet in no character have the&s;e talents been &s;o agreeably united, <HI>for there aro&s;e not a prophet &s;ince in I&s;rael like unto Mo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>AND notwith&s;tanding &s;uch a combination of the mo&s;t excellent talents, as rarely centre in one man, yet they afford him no &s;hield from calumny, nor &s;helter from the reproaches of an ungrateful rebellious people. That people often &s;inned again&s;t God, in murmuring again&s;t Mo&s;es, at the <HI>red &s;ea,</HI> in the <HI>wilderne&s;s,</HI> at <HI>Sinai</HI> and the water of <HI>Meribah.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="039139_0008_1013EB9C31060C80">NOR are &s;uch talents a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t &s;in. Even <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> after he had carried the children of I&s;rael through the wilderne&s;s, with much patience and tribula|tion, &s;inned again&s;t God at the waters of <HI>Meribah kade&s;h.</HI> But the Lord forgave him his &s;in. Notwith&s;tanding he &s;aid, thou &s;halt &s;ee with thine eye, but &s;halt not pa&s;s over this Jordan, into the good land, whether the children of I&s;arel go to po&s;&s;e&s;s it. Therefore <HI>get thee up into this moun|tain Abarim, into mount Nebo; and die in the mount whether thou goe&s;t up, and be gathered to thy people.</HI> Which leads us to con&s;ider in the</P>
<P N="2">2nd. place, THAT human greatne&s;s and excellency afford no exemption from death.</P>
<P>IF a &s;ingle te&s;timony could e&s;tabli&s;h a truth, this had been &s;ufficient. But we are not reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of relying on a &s;ingle te&s;timony. Our Fathers where are they, and the Prophets do they live forever? Death hath pa&s;&s;ed upon all men,&mdash;for death hath reigned from Adam until Mo&s;es&mdash;and from Mo&s;es until now.&mdash; Death &s;talks, alike unconcerned, over the Prince upon the throne, and the pea&s;ant in the cottage. Oh! thou relent|le&s;s tyrant, wilt thou never be &s;atisfied? Can no ties of nature or affection move you? Shall not the love, nay, I had almo&s;t &s;aid the adoration of millions make thee re|lent? &mdash;Wilt thou pay no re&s;pect to the highe&s;t talents&mdash; to the greate&s;t achievments&mdash;to the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices rendered to the world, nor to tho&s;e chri&s;tian graces which advance men near to the perfection of Angels? No!&mdash; no!&mdash;But rather like the envious fair, who eagerly de&s;|cries, and crops the fine&s;t flower!&mdash;</P>
<P>Will there never be an end?&mdash;O yes! my heart exults! That holy one, who led captivity captive, and re|ceived gifts for men, &s;hall di&s;arm thee of all thy terrors,
<PB N="9" REF="039139_0009_1013EB9ECE740708">
and di&s;poil thee of all thy powers, for the la&s;t enemy which &s;hall be conquered is Death. But in the mean time there is a &s;uitable and proper temper to be exerci&s;ed by the people of God. Which will lead me in the</P>
<P N="3">3d place, To con&s;ider the duty of a people when characters eminently u&s;eful are removed.&mdash;</P>
<P>THIS is expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;econd paragraph in the text. <HI>"And the children of I&s;rael wept for Mo&s;es in the plain of Moab, thirty days."</HI></P>
<P>MANY and various methods have been adopted to ex|pre&s;s &s;orrow. By external deportment, &s;adne&s;s of the countenance, forms of dre&s;s, mournful &s;ounds, and bitter lamentations. But none appear to be &s;o natural, ration|al or &s;incere as that of weaping. It is not certain, that every heart which is &s;incerely affected can expre&s;s its &s;or|row by a flowing tear. The heart may be &s;o &s;welled with &s;orrow, as entirely to forbid the tear to flow. When, to give aloof to tears, would afford great relief to a bur|dened &s;oul. But men can rarely weep, except the heart is &s;en&s;ibly impre&s;&s;ed. Hence it is con&s;idered as carry|ing with it the highe&s;t evidence of &s;incere &s;orrow. That the grief of the children of I&s;rael, at the removal of &s;o great and amiable a character as Mo&s;es, was &s;incere, is hardly to be doubted. And we have &s;till farther evidence of its &s;incerity, by its univer&s;ality. It was not a few of the Elders of I&s;rael, of the family connexions, or more intimate acquaintance and relations, who were affected by this di&s;pen&s;ation, but the whole hou&s;e and family of I&s;rael. This was farther expre&s;&s;ed by the long period which they devoted to &s;orrow and woe. However many in|&s;tances may be recorded in the Jewi&s;h Hi&s;tory of long periods of &s;orrow and weeping, yet few, if any, have exceeded the pre&s;ent account; and few which have ex|hibited
<PB N="10" REF="039139_0010_1013EBA0AFCEC8E8">
greater evidence of its propriety and &s;inceri|ty.</P>
<P>DEATH, as the con&s;equence of &s;in, hath given ju&s;t oc|ca&s;ion of great &s;orrow. That &s;orrow, upon &s;uch occa|&s;ions, is a dictate of nature, is founded on experience. That it is a duty is made plain, by a train of divine ap|probation and precepts. And that it is con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t lively oracles of our holy religion, appears, from the illu&s;trious comment which it received, from <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> at the Grave of Lazarus. Still my Brethren, this &s;orrow &s;hould bear &s;ome proportion to the magnitude of its exi&s;t|ing cau&s;e. When Individuals die, <HI>friends, relatives</HI> and <HI>neighbours</HI> may weep. But when <HI>great</HI> &amp; <HI>illu&s;trious Char|acters</HI> fall, the <HI>fathers</HI> of the people, it becomes a <HI>whole na|tion</HI> to put on garbs of the deepe&s;t humiliation.</P>
<P>I TRUST by this time, my hearers have formed &s;ome ju&s;t idea of the improvement, I de&s;ign to make of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject&mdash;</P>
<P>INDEED my Brethren, in many re&s;pects, our &s;ituation is not di&s;&s;imilar from the children of I&s;rael. They be|wailed a <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> we a WASHINGTON. A character, than who&s;e, none can be more de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed, nor any ought, more &s;incerely to be loved. Since the days of Mo&s;es, there hath not a character ari&s;en, to grace the page of Hi&s;tory, more un&s;ullied, or, who hath a ju&s;ter claim to honor and renown. A &s;econd Mo&s;es rai&s;ed up of God, to be a deliverer of this American I&s;rael.</P>
<P>MANY of you, on painful recollection, can remember, when your liberties were in danger. When you were oppre&s;&s;ed by a great and powerful nation. A nation &s;killed in arts and wars: Who &s;at Mi&s;tre&s;s of the &s;eas, and governed nations with a nod. A nation, whom &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es
<PB N="11" REF="039139_0011_1013D685B3B50B98">
had rendered lofty and imperious, and whom pride and haughtine&s;s had made as li&s;tle&s;s to your entreaties, as the Egyptians to the miracles of Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>NOR can you fail to recollect the &s;tate of this infant nation. How weak, how defencele&s;s? How un&s;killed in warlike atchievments? How helple&s;s in the &s;ight of the nations? Without were fightings, within were fears. This was our &s;ituation, when the <HI>Lord</HI> rai&s;ed up a <HI>Cap|tain</HI> for the ho&s;t, added <HI>&s;trength</HI> to his <HI>Courage, wi&s;dom</HI> to his <HI>&s;trength,</HI> and <HI>prowre&s;s</HI> to his <HI>wi&s;dom.</HI> Made him a deliverer of his people. Repeated &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and innu|merable prai&s;es which would have elated the heart of any other man, &s;eemed only calculated to teach him hu|mility, and dependence on God. Such was the human|ity and benevolence of this conqueror, as to put to &s;ilence the tongue of malice and envy.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner, under the providence of God, was the <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>Independence</HI> of this nation &s;ecured, than the eyes of all the people were upon him. By their united voice, he entered the Cabinet, with as much dignity, as he re|tired from the field. There for years he held the reins of ri&s;ing empire. Altho, there he di&s;played talents which have a&s;toni&s;hed the world, yet it could not be expected, but &s;ome, who were prejudiced in favor of the <HI>leeks</HI> and <HI>Onions</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> or &s;trongly attached to the <HI>idolatries</HI> of <HI>Canaan,</HI> would in&s;tigate a rebellion again&s;t him.</P>
<P>HOWEVER God may rai&s;e up in his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, Jo&s;hu|as to lead the ho&s;t and Judges to rule the people; Yet they never can, under exi&s;ting circum&s;tances, nor ought they ever to expect, to arrive, at that degree of un&s;ullied univer&s;al fame with their predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>EVEN here, I know not whether mo&s;t to admire, that
<PB N="12" REF="039139_0012_1013EBA70ADFDFE0">
train of &s;hining talents expre&s;&s;ed in the cabinet and field, or the dignity with which he retired from ri&s;ing empire to private life. In this, he leaves on long record, an ex|ample without precedent for the great. The ea&s;tern world may boa&s;t of an Alexander, Ceazar, Pompey, So|lon or Lycurgus, but where is the man, in the meredian of life, on the &s;ummit of human greatne&s;s, at the head of empire; who freely did re&s;ign the reins of &s;tate, and retire with plea&s;ure to the humble &s;tation of a private cit|izen. In &s;ubmitting him&s;elf to tho&s;e laws, who&s;e &s;ig|nature had rendered valid, he exhibited the mo&s;t unque&s;|tionable evidence of his own integrity. He manife&s;ted him&s;elf a faithful imitator of his Lord and Ma&s;ter; in being willing to be governed by tho&s;e laws which he had framed for his people.</P>
<P>FAIR Virtue &s;hone&mdash;in this ble&s;&s;ed retreat&mdash;to crown his name&mdash;But here alas! the joyful theme mu&s;t end.</P>
<P>DISEASE was &s;hort, and his flight was rapid, le&s;t the united prayer of Millions had prevailed, e're his fleeting &s;pirit had reached the world of bli&s;s. Methinks he &s;ound all heaven in joy, but left the world in tears.</P>
<P>NOW boa&s;t thou Tyrant of thy &s;uperior conque&s;t, for thou ha&s;t no more WASHINGTONS to conquer. Or rather &s;ay, his tru&s;t in God, di&s;arm'd thee of thy ter|rors, and re&s;ignation to the King of Saints, deprived thee of a conque&s;t.</P>
<P>'TIS all the &s;ame to us, we mourn him dead. How happy when our duty and inclination coincide. Your &s;olem garbs be&s;peak a heart of &s;orrow.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Hou&s;e of God was dre&s;&s;ed in deep mourning. Mo&s;t of the inhabitants as they approach'd, joined and walked in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion to the &s;anctuary, and generally wore &s;ome ex|ternal badge of mourning.</NOTE> While your

external &s;how is lo&s;t amid&s;t the pomp of cities, and par|ade of thou&s;ands, let not the &s;incerity of your &s;orrows be called in que&s;tion. Nor let the tear of &s;orrow be di&s;|gui&s;ed, before the eye of him who tries the heart. Nor &s;hould your &s;ighs be unattended by your prayers. The&s;e pious breathings, under God, a like affect the <HI>ruler</HI> and the <HI>&s;ubject.</HI> The&s;e are the be&s;t Armada for a defencele&s;s Country. The&s;e in&s;pire our ho&s;ts with fortitude and courage, for the mo&s;t daring enterprizes: and fill our enemies with terror and di&s;may. The&s;e change the coun&s;el of Ahithophel into fooli&s;hne&s;s. The&s;e, under the plentiful effu&s;ions of the &s;pirit of God, as have been poured out upon many of his churches, if continued, will render Zion a prai&s;e in the whole earth.

<P>MAY he, who is the cho&s;en head of this people, while he &s;tands gazing at the a&s;cent of his predece&s;&s;or, catch the falling mantle, and be di&s;po&s;ed to rule this people in obe|dience to him, <HI>by whom Kings reign and princes decree ju&s;|tice.</HI></P>
<P>MAY he al&s;o, who is rai&s;ed up to be the <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> of our ho&s;ts, who hath accompanied our Mo&s;es thro' the trials of the wilderne&s;s, have the pre&s;ence of that God, before whom the walls of Jericho were laid pro&s;trate, and the waters of Jordan were drawn backward.

<HEAD>AN APPENDIX, Giving a particular account of the behaviour of Gen. WASHINGTON, during his di&s;tre&s;&s;ing illne&s;s, &amp;c. by two of his Phy&s;icians.</HEAD>

<P>SOME time in the night of Friday the 13th in&s;t. hav|ing been expo&s;ed to a rain on the preceding day, Gene|ral WASHINGTON was attacked with an inflammatory affection of the upper part of the windpipe, called in the technical language <HI>Cynache Trachealis.</HI> The di&s;ea&s;e commenced with a violent ague, accompanied with &s;ome pain in the upper and fore part of the throat, a &s;en&s;e of &s;tricture in the &s;ame part, a cough, and a difficult, rather than a painful deglutition, which were &s;oon &s;ucceeded by a fever, and a quick and laborious re&s;piration. The nece&s;&s;ity of bloodletting &s;ugge&s;ting it&s;elf to the General, he procured a bleeder in the neighbourhood, who took from his arm in the night 12 or 14 ounces of blood. He could not by any means be prevailed on by the family to &s;end for the attending phy&s;ician till the following morning, who arrived at Mount-Vernon at about 11 o'clock on Saturday. Di&s;covering the ca&s;e to be highly

alarming, and fore&s;eeing the fatal tendency of the di&s;ea&s;e, two con&s;ulting phy&s;icions were immediately &s;ent for, who arrived, one at half after three, and the other at four o'clock in the afternoon: in the mean time were employ|ed two pretty copious bleedings, a bli&s;ter was applied to the part affected, two moderate do&s;es of calomel were given, and an injection was admini&s;tered, which operated on the lower inte&s;tines, but all without any perceptible advantage, the re&s;piration becoming &s;till more difficult and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. Upon the arrival of the fir&s;t of the con|&s;ulting phy&s;icians, it was agreed, as there were yet no &s;igns of accumulation in the bronchial ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, to try the re&s;ult of another bleeding, when about 32 ounces of blood were drawn, without the &s;malle&s;t apparent alleviation of the di&s;ea&s;e. Vapours of vinegar and water were frequently inhaled, ten grains of calomel were given, &s;ucceeded by repeated do&s;es of emetic tar|tar, amounting in all to 5 or 6 grains, with no other effect than a copious di&s;charge from the bowels. The power of life &s;eemed now manife&s;tly yielding to the force of the di&s;order; bli&s;ters were applied to the ex|tremities, together with a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of bran and vinegar to the throat. Speaking, which was painful from the beginning, now became almo&s;t impracticable; re&s;pira|tion grew more and more contracted and imperfect, till at half after eleven on Saturday night, retaining the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his intellects&mdash;when he expired without a &s;truggle.</P>
<P>HE was fully impre&s;&s;ed at the beginning of his com|plaint, as well as through every &s;ucceeding &s;tage of it, that its conclu&s;ion would be mortal; &s;ubmitting to the &s;everal exertions made for his recovery, rather as a duty, than from any expectations of their efficacy. He con|&s;idered the operations of death upon his &s;y&s;tem as coeval

with the di&s;ea&s;e; and &s;everal hours his before death, after repeated efforts to be under&s;tood, &s;ucceeded in expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire that he might be permitted to die without further interruption.</P>
<P>DURING the &s;hort period of his illne&s;s, he oeconomi&s;|ed his time, in the arrangement of &s;uch few concerns as required his attention, with the utmo&s;t &s;erenity; and an|ticipated his approaching di&s;&s;olution with every demon|&s;tration of that equanimity for which his whole life has been &s;o uniformly and &s;ingularly con&s;picuous.</P>
