<HEAD>THE Two Wealthy Farmers, &amp;c. PART III.</HEAD>
<P>He had, however, &s;o &s;trong a de&s;ire to be u&s;eful to Mr. Bragwell, that he at length determined to break through his practice and pa&s;s the Sunday at his hou&s;e. Mr. Worthy was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that though the Church bell was going, the breakfa&s;t was not ready, and expre&s;&s;ed his wonder how this &s;hould be the ca&s;e in &s;o indu&s;trious a family. Bragwell made &s;ome aukward excu&s;es. He &s;aid his wife worked her &s;ervants &s;o hard all the week, that even &s;he, as notable as &s;he was, a little relaxed from the &s;trict|ne&s;s of her demands on Sunday morn|ings; and he owned that in a general way, no one was up early enough for church. He confe&s;&s;ed that his wife commonly &s;pent the morning in making puddings, pies, and cakes, to la&s;t through the week, as Sunday was the only lei&s;ure time &s;he and her maids had. Mr. Wor|thy &s;oon &s;aw an uncommon bu&s;tle in the hou&s;e. All hands were bu&s;y. I was nothing but baking, and boiling
<PB N="3" REF="037134_0003_100C9266B0025FF0">
and frying, and roa&s;ting, and running, and &s;colding, and eating. The boy was kept from Church to clean the plate, the man to gather the fruit, the mi&s;tre&s;s to make the chee&s;e-cakes, the maids to dre&s;s the dinner, and the young ladies to dre&s;s them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The truth was, Mrs. Bragwell, who had heard much of the order and good management of Mr. Worthy's family, but who looked down with di&s;dain upon them as far le&s;s rich than her&s;elf, was re|&s;olved to indulge her vanity on the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion. She was determined to be even with Mrs. Worthy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who&s;e prai|&s;es Bragwell had been &s;o loud, and felt no &s;mall plea&s;ure in the hope of making her gue&s;t unea&s;y, when he &s;hould be &s;truck with the di&s;play both of her &s;kill and her wealth. Mr. Worthy was indeed &s;truck to behold as large a dinner as he had been u&s;ed to &s;ee at a Ju&s;tice's meeting. He, who&s;e frugal and pious wife had ac|cu&s;tomed him only to &s;uch a &s;unday's dinner as could be dre&s;&s;ed without keep|ing any one from church, when he &s;ur|veyed the loaded table of his friend, in|&s;tead of feeling that envy which the&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="037134_0004_100C92683A4BB4C0">
grand preparations were meant to rai&s;e, felt nothing but di&s;gu&s;t at the vanity of his friend's wife, mixed with much thank|fulne&s;s for the piety of his own.</P>
<P>After having made the dinner wait a long time, the Mi&s;s Bragwells marched in, dre&s;&s;ed as if they were going to the A&s;&s;ize Ball; they looked very &s;cornful at having been &s;o hurried; though they had been dre&s;&s;ing ever &s;ince they got up, and their fond father, when he &s;aw them &s;o fine, forgave all their impertinence, and ca&s;t an eye of triumph on Mr. Wor|thy, who felt he had never loved his own humble daughters &s;o well as at that mo|ment.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, the whole party went to church. To do them ju&s;tice, it was indeed their common practice once a day, when the weather was good, and the road neither du&s;ty nor dirty, when the Mi|ni&s;ter did not begin too early, when the young Ladies had not been di&s;appointed of their new bonnets on the Saturday night, and when they had no &s;mart com|pany in the hou&s;e who rather wi&s;hed to &s;tay at home. When this la&s;t was the
<PB N="5" REF="037134_0005_100C9269CB28AC98">
ca&s;e, which, to &s;ay the truth, happened pretty often, it was thought a piece of good manners to conform to the humour of the gue&s;ts. Mr. Bragwell had this day forborne to a&s;k any of his u&s;ual company, well knowing that their vain and worldly conver&s;ation would only &s;erve to draw on him &s;ome new reprimand from his gue&s;t.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bragwell and her daughters pick|ed up as u&s;ual a good deal of acquaintance at church. Many compliments pa&s;&s;ed, and much of the news of the week was retailed before the &s;ervice began. They waited with impatience for the le&s;&s;ons as a licen&s;ed &s;ea&s;on for whi&s;pering, and the &s;ubject begun during the le&s;&s;ons was fini&s;h|ed while they were &s;inging. The young Ladies made an appointment for the af|ternoon with a friend in the next pew, while their Mamma took the opportunity of enquiring the character of a Dairy Maid, which &s;he ob&s;erved with a com|pliment to her own good management, would &s;ave time on a week day.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy, who found him&s;elf quite in a new world, returned home with his
<PB N="6" REF="037134_0006_100C926C6571A1E0">
friend alone. In the evening he ventu|red to a&s;k Bragwell, if he did not, on a Sunday night at lea&s;t, make it a cu&s;tom to read and pray with his family. Bragwell told him he was &s;orry to &s;ay he had no fa|mily at home, el&s;e he &s;hould like to do it for the &s;ake of example. But as his &s;ervants worked hard all the week, his wife was of opinion that they &s;hould then have a little holiday. Mr. Worthy pre&s;&s;|ed it home upon him, if the utter neglect of his &s;ervant's principles was not likely to make a heavy article in his final ac|count: and a&s;ked him if he did not be|lieve that the too general liberty of meet|ing together, jaunting and diverting them|&s;elves, on Sunday evenings, was not often found to produce the wor&s;t effects on the morals of &s;ervants and the good order of families? "I put it to your con|&s;cience," &s;aid he, "Mr. Bragwell, whe|ther Sunday, which was meant as a ble&s;|&s;ing and a benefit, is not, as it is com|monly kept, turned into the mo&s;t mi&s;chie|vous part of the week, by the &s;elfi&s;h kind|ne&s;s of ma&s;ters, who, not daring to &s;et their &s;ervants about any public work, al|lot them that day to follow their own de|vices, that they them&s;elves may with
<PB N="7" REF="037134_0007_100C926E53557E50">
more rigour refu&s;e them a little indul|gence and a rea&s;onable holiday in the working part of the week, which a good &s;ervant has now and then a right to ex|pect." Tho&s;e ma&s;ters who will give them half or all of the Lord's day, will not &s;pare them a &s;ingle hour of a working day. <HI>Their work must</HI> be done; GOD's work may be let alone."</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell owned that Sunday had produced many mi&s;chiefs in his own fa|mily. That the young men and maids, having no eye upon them, frequently went to improper places with other &s;er|vants turned adrift like them&s;elves. That in the&s;e parties the poor girls were too frequently led a&s;tray, and the men got to public hou&s;es and fives-playing. But it was none of his bu&s;ine&s;s to watch them. His family only did as others do; indeed it was his wife's concern; and as &s;he was &s;o good a manager on other days, that &s;he would not &s;pare them an hour even to vi&s;it a &s;ick father or mother, it would be hard &s;he &s;aid, if they might not have Sunday afternoon to them&s;elves, and &s;he could not blame them for making the mo&s;t of it. Indeed &s;he was &s;o indul|gent
<PB N="8" REF="037134_0008_100C926FDEADCE38">
in this particular, that &s;he often excu&s;ed the men from going to church that they might &s;erve the bea&s;ts, and the maids that they might get the milking done before the holiday part of the even|ing c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me on. She would not indeed hear of any competition between doing <HI>her</HI> work and taking their plea&s;ure; but when the difference lay between their going to church and taking their plea&s;ure, he mu&s;t &s;ay that for his wife, &s;he was always inclined to the good-natured &s;ide of the que&s;tion. She is &s;trict enough in keeping them &s;ober, becau&s;e drunkenne&s;s is a co&s;tly &s;in, and to do her ju&s;tice, &s;he does not care how little they &s;in at her ex|pence.</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Mr. Worthy, "I always like to examine both &s;ides fairly, and to &s;ee the different effects of oppo&s;ite practi|ces; now, which plan produces the great|e&s;t &s;hare of comfort to the ma&s;ter and of profit to the &s;ervants in the long run? Your &s;ervants, 'tis likely, are very much attached to you; and very fond of living where they get their own way in &s;o great a point."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037134_0009_100C9271CA630EC0">"O, as to that," replied Bragwell, "you are quite out. My hou&s;e is a &s;cene of di&s;cord, mutiny and di&s;content. And though there is not a better manager in England than my wife, yet &s;he is always changing her &s;ervants, &s;o that every Quarter-day is a &s;ort of Gaol Delivery at my hou&s;e; and when they go off, as they often do, at a moment's warning, to own the truth, I often give them money pri|vately, that they may not carry my wife before the Ju&s;tice to get their wages.</P>
<P>"I &s;ee," &s;aid Mr. Worthy, "that all your worldly compliances do not procure you even worldly happine&s;s. As to my own family, I take care to let them &s;ee that their plea&s;ure is bound up with their duty, and that what they may call my &s;trictne&s;s, has nothing in view but their &s;afety and happine&s;s. By this means I commonly gain their love as well as &s;e|cure their obedience. I know that with all my care I am liable to be di&s;appointed, from the corruption that is in the world through &s;in. But whenever this happens, &s;o far from encouraging me in remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, it only &s;erves to quicken my zeal. If by God's ble&s;&s;ing, my &s;ervant turns out a
<PB N="10" REF="037134_0010_100C9274385B1BD8">
good Chri&s;tian, I have been an humble in&s;trument in his hand of &s;aving a &s;oul committed to my charge."</P>
<P>Mrs. Bragwell came home, but brought only one of her daughters with her, the other, &s;he &s;aid, had given them the &s;lip, and was gone with a young friend, and would not return for a day or two. Mr. Bragwell was greatly di&s;plea&s;ed, as he knew that young friend had but a &s;light character, and kept bad acquaintances. Mrs. Bragwell came in all hurry and bu&s;tle, &s;aying, if her family did not "go to-bed with the Lamb" on Sundays, when they had nothing to do, how could they "ri&s;e with the Lark" on Mondays, when &s;o much was to be done.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy had this night much matter for reflection. "We need not." &s;aid he, "go into the great world to look for di&s;&s;ipation and vanity. We can find both in a farm-hou&s;e. As for me and my hou&s;e," continued he, "we will &s;erve the Lord every day, but e&s;pecially on Sundays. It is the day which the Lord hath made: hath made for him&s;elf; we will re|joice in it, and con&s;ider the religious u&s;e of it not only as a duty but as a privilege."</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037134_0011_100C92762082E040">Mr. Bragwell and Mr. Worthy &s;et out early on the next morning on their way to the Golden Lion, a &s;mall Inn in a neighbouring market town. As they had time before them, they had agreed to ride &s;lowly, that they might conver&s;e on &s;ome u&s;eful &s;ubject; but here, as u&s;u|al, they had two opinions about the &s;ame thing. Mr. Bragwell's notion of an u&s;e|ful &s;ubject was, &s;omething by which mo|ney was to be got, and a good bargain &s;truck. Mr. Worthy was no le&s;s a man of bu&s;ine&s;s than his friend. His &s;chemes were wi&s;e and his calculations ju&s;t; his reputation for integrity and good &s;en&s;e made him the common judge and umpire in his neighbours affairs, while no one paid a more exact attention to every tran&s;action of his own. But the bu&s;ine&s;s of getting money was not with him the fir&s;t, much le&s;s was it the whole concern of the day. Every morning when he ro&s;e, he remembered that he had a Ma|ker to wor&s;hip as well as a family to maintain. Religion however, never made him neglect bu&s;ine&s;s, though it &s;ometimes led him to po&s;tpone it. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, no man had any rea&s;on to expect God's ble&s;&s;ing through the day who did not a&s;k
<PB N="12" REF="037134_0012_100C9277ABCF1A68">
it in the morning. But he had not the le&s;s &s;en&s;e, &s;pirit, and activity when he was among men abroad, becau&s;e he had fir&s;t &s;erved God at home.</P>
<P>As the&s;e two Farmers rode along, Mr. Worthy took occa&s;ion from the finene&s;s of the day, and the beauty of the country through which they pa&s;&s;ed to turn the di&s;cour&s;e to the goodne&s;s of God and our infinite obligations to him. He knew that the tran&s;ition from thank&s;giving to prayer would be natural and ea&s;y, and he therefore &s;lid, by degrees, into that important &s;ubject; and he ob&s;erved that &s;ecret prayer was a duty of univer&s;al ob|ligation, which every man had it in his power to fulfil, and which he &s;eriou&s;ly believed was the ground work of all reli|gious practice, and of all devout affections.</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell felt con&s;cious that he was very negligent and irregular in the performance of this duty, he con&s;idered it as a mere ceremony, or at lea&s;t as a duty which might give way to the &s;lighte&s;t temptation of drow&s;ine&s;s at night, or of bu&s;ine&s;s in the morning. As he knew he did not live in the con&s;cientious perform|ance of this practice, he tried to ward
<PB N="13" REF="037134_0013_100C927999939B80">
off the &s;ubject, knowing what a home way his friend had of putting things. At la&s;t he &s;aid, he certainly thought private prayer a good cu&s;tom, e&s;pecially for peo|ple who have time, and that tho&s;e who were &s;ick, or old, or out of bu&s;ine&s;s, could not do better, but that, for his part, he believed much of the&s;e &s;ort of things was not expected from men in active life.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould think Mr. Bragwell, that tho&s;e who are mo&s;t expo|&s;ed to temptation &s;tand mo&s;t in need of prayer; now there are few methinks who are more expo&s;ed to temptation than men in bu&s;ine&s;s, for tho&s;e mu&s;t be in mo&s;t danger, at lea&s;t from the world, who have mo&s;t to do with it. And if this be true, ought we not to prepare our&s;elves in the clo&s;et for the trials of the market, the field, and the &s;hop?</P>

<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, I think ex|ample is the whole of Religion, and if the ma&s;ter of a family is orderly, and regular, and goes to church, he does every thing which can be required of him, and no one has a right to call him to account for any thing more.</P>

<P>Give me leave to &s;ay, Mr. Bragwell that highly as I rate a good ex|ample, &s;till I mu&s;t &s;et a good principle above it. I mu&s;t keep good order indeed, for the &s;ake of others; but I mu&s;t keep a good con&s;cience for my own &s;ake. To God I owe &s;ecret piety, I mu&s;t therefore pray to him in private.&mdash;To my family I owe a Chri&s;tian example, and for that, among other rea&s;ons, I mu&s;t not &s;ail to go to Church.</P>

<P>You are talking, Mr. Wor|thy, as if I were an enemy to Chri&s;tianity. Sir, I am no Heathen. Sir, I belong to the Church. I always drink pro&s;perity to the Church. You your&s;elf, as &s;trict as you are, in never mi&s;&s;ing it twice a day, are not a warmer friend to the Church than I am.</P>

<P>That is to &s;ay, you know its value as an in&s;titution, but you do not &s;eem to know that a man may be very irreligious under the be&s;t religious in&s;ti|tutions; and that even the mo&s;t excel|lent of them are but <HI>means</HI> of being religi|ous, and are no more religion it&s;elf than brick and mortar are prayers and thank&s;|givings.

<P>Mr. Worthy, I am per|&s;uaded that religion is quite a proper thing for the poor; and I don't think that the multitude can ever be kept in order without it, and I am a bit of a po|litician you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your opinion is very ju&s;t, as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough, &s;ince it does not go to the root of the evil, for while you value your&s;elf on the &s;ound|ne&s;s of this principle as a politician, I wi&s;h you to &s;ee the rea&s;on of it as a Chri&s;|tian; depend upon it, if Religion be good for the community at large, it is equally good for every family; and what is right for a family is equally right for each in|dividual in it. You have therefore your|&s;elf brought the mo&s;t unan&s;werable ar|gument why you ought to be religious, by a&s;king how we &s;hall keep others in

<P>If a foreigner were to hear how violently one &s;et of Chri&s;tians in this country often &s;peak again&s;t another, how earne&s;t would he &s;uppo&s;e us all to be in religious matters: and how a&s;toni&s;hed to di&s;cover that many a man has perhaps little other proof to give of the &s;incerity of his own religion, except the violence

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly I do. But I don't believe it <HI>merely</HI> becau&s;e I read it in Gene&s;is. I know, indeed, that I am bound to believe every of the word of God. But I have &s;till an additional rea|&s;on for believing in the fall of the fir&s;t man.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you indeed? Now, I can't gue&s;s what that can be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why my own ob&s;ervation of what is in my&s;elf teaches me to believe it. It is not only the third chapter of Gene&s;is which convinces me of the truth of the fall, but al&s;o the &s;inful inclinations which I find in my own heart. This is one of tho&s;e leading truth's of Chri&s;tianity of which I can never doubt a moment, fir&s;t, becau&s;e it is abundantly expre&s;&s;ed or implied in Scripture; and next, be|cau&s;e the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the evil nature I carry about with me confirms the doc|trine beyond all doubt. Be&s;ides, is it not &s;aid in Scripture that by one man &s;in en|tered

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I never thought of this. But is not this a very melancholy &s;ort of doctrine, Mr. Worthy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is melancholy, indeed, if we &s;top here. But while we are deploring this &s;ad truth, let us take comfort from another, that "As in Adam all die, &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I remember I thought tho&s;e very fine words, when I heard them &s;aid over my poor father's grave. But as it was in the Burial of the dead, I did not think of taking it to my&s;elf, for I was then young and hearty, and in little dan|ger of dying, and I have been &s;o bu&s;y ever &s;ince, that I have hardly had time to think of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet the &s;ervice pronoun|ced at the burial of all who die, is a &s;o|lemn admonition to all who live. It is

there &s;aid, as indeed the Scripture &s;ays al&s;o, "I am the re&s;urrection and the life, who&s;oever <HI>believeth in me</HI> &s;hall never die, but I will rai&s;e him up at the la&s;t day." Now do you think you <HI>believe in Christ,</HI> Mr. Bragwell?</P>

<P>In order to believe in Chri&s;t, we mu&s;t believe fir&s;t in our own guilt and our own unworthine&s;s, and when we do this we &s;hall &s;ee the u&s;e of a Saviour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, all this is a new way of talking, I can't &s;ay, I ever meddled with &s;uch &s;ubjects before in my life. But now, what do you advi&s;e a man to do upon your plan of Religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, all this leads me back to the ground from which we &s;et out. I mean the duty of prayer; for if we be|lieve that we have an evil nature within us, and that we &s;tand in need of God's grace to help us, and a Saviour to redeem us, we &s;hall be led of cour&s;e to pray for what we &s;o much need.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but don't you think, Mr. Worthy, that you good folks who make &s;o much of prayer, have lower no|tions than we of the wi&s;dom of the Almigh|ty? you think he wants to be informed of the things you tell him; whereas, I take for granted that he knows them al|ready, and that, being &s;o good as he is, he will give me every thing he &s;ees fit to give me without my a&s;king it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>God, indeed, who knows all things, knows what we want before we a&s;k him, but &s;till has he not &s;aid, that with prayer and &s;upplication we mu&s;t make known our reque&s;ts unto him." Prayer is the way in which God hath &s;aid that his favour mu&s;t be &s;ought. It is the channel through which he hath declared it is his &s;overeign will and plea&s;ure that his ble&s;&s;ings &s;hould be conveyed to us. What a&s;cends up in prayer de&s;cends again to us in ble&s;&s;ings. It is like the rain which ju&s;t now fell, and which had been drawn up from the ground in vapours to the clouds before it de&s;cended from them to the earth in that refre&s;hing &s;how|er. Be&s;ides prayer has a good effect on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> minds: it tends to excite a
<PB N="23" REF="037134_0023_100C928DA8706EA8">

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now that is the very thing which I was going to deny. For the truth is, men don't always get what they a&s;k; I believe if I could get a good crop for a&s;king it I &s;hould pray oftener than I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes Mr. Bragwell, men "a&s;k and receive not, becau&s;e they a&s;k ami&s;s." They a&s;k worldly ble&s;&s;ings perhaps when they &s;hould a&s;k &s;piritual ones. Now the latter, which are the good things I &s;poke of, are always granted to tho&s;e who pray to God for them, though the former are not. I have ob&s;erved in the ca&s;e of &s;ome worldly things I have &s;ought for, that the grant of my prayer would have cau&s;ed the mi&s;ery of my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you continue to pray on I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly; but then I try to mend as to the object of my prayers.

<P>How &s;o, Mr. Worthy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;uppo&s;e now, you were to try your&s;elf by turning into the &s;hape of a prayer every practice in which you allow your&s;elf. For in&s;tance, let the prayer in the morning be a &s;ort of preparation for the deeds of the day, and the prayer at night a &s;ort of ob&s;ervation on tho&s;e deeds. You, Mr. Bragwell, I &s;u&s;pect are a lit|tle inclined to covetou&s;ne&s;s, excu&s;e me, Sir. Now &s;uppo&s;e after you have been

during a whole day a little too eager to get rich, &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;ay, you were to try how it would &s;ound to beg of God at night to give you &s;till more money though you have already &s;o much that you know not what to do with it. Suppo&s;e you were to pray in the morning, O Lord give me more riches, though tho&s;e I have are a &s;nare and a temptation to me; and a&s;k him in the &s;ame &s;olemn manner to ble&s;s all the gra&s;ping means you intend to make u&s;e of in the day, to add to your &s;ub&s;tance?</P>

<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Worthy, I have no patience with you for thinking I could be &s;o wicked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me out, Mr. Bragwell, you turned your good nephew, Tom Broad, out of doors you know; you own|ed to me it was an act of inju&s;tice. Now &s;uppo&s;e on the morning of your doing &s;o you had begged of God in a &s;olemn act of prayer to pro&s;per the deed of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion, which you intended to com|mit. I &s;ee you are &s;hocked at the thought of &s;uch a prayer. Well, then, would not prayer have kept you from committing that wicked action? In &s;hort, what a life
<PB N="26" REF="037134_0026_100C9293076DA068">
mu&s;t that be, no act of which you dare beg God to pro&s;per and ble&s;s. If once you can bring your&s;elf to believe that it is your bounden duty to pray-for God's ble&s;&s;ing on your day's work, you will cer|tainly grow careful about pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch a day as you may &s;afely a&s;k his ble&s;&s;ing up|on. The remark may be carried to &s;ports, diver&s;ions, company. A man who once takes up the &s;erious u&s;e of prayer, will &s;oon find him&s;elf obliged to ab&s;tain from &s;uch diver&s;ions, occupations and &s;ocieties, as he cannot rea&s;onably de&s;ire that God will ble&s;s to him; and thus he will &s;ee him&s;elf compelled to leave off either the practice or the prayer. Now, Mr. Brag|well, I need not a&s;k you which of the two he that is a real Chri&s;tian will give up.</P>
</SP>
<P>Mr. Bragwell began to feel that he had not the be&s;t of the argument, and was afraid he was making no great figure in the eyes of his friend. Luckily however, he was relieved from the difficulty into which the nece&s;&s;ity of making &s;ome an|&s;wer mu&s;t have brought him, by finding they were come to the end of their little journey; and he never he held the Bunch of Grapes, which decorated the Sign of the Golden Lion, with more real &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="037134_0027_100C92954F6BB160">Mr. Bragwell and Mr. Worthy alight|ed at the Golden Lion. It was market day: the inn, the yard, the town was all alive. Mr. Bragwell was quite in his element. He felt him&s;elf the principal man in the company. He had three great objects in view, the &s;ale of his land, the letting Mr. Worthy &s;ee how much he was looked up to by &s;o many &s;ubt&s;antial people, and the &s;hewing the&s;e people what a wi&s;e man his mo&s;t intimate friend Mr. Worthy was. It was his way to try to borrow a little credit from every per&s;on and every thing he was connected with, and by that credit to advance his intere&s;t and increa&s;e his wealth.</P>
<P>The Farmers met in a large room, and while they were tran&s;acting their various concerns, tho&s;e who&s;e pur&s;uits were the &s;ame naturally herded together. The Tanners were drawn to one corner, by the common intere&s;t which they took in bark, and hides. A u&s;eful debate was carrying on at another little table, whether the practice of <HI>sowing</HI> wheat or of <HI>plant|ing</HI> it were mo&s;t profitable. Another &s;et were di&s;puting whether hor&s;es or oxen were be&s;t for plows. Tho&s;e who were
<PB N="28" REF="037134_0028_100C9296DC437940">
concerned in Canals, &s;ought the compa|ny of other Canallers; while &s;ome who were intere&s;ted in the new bill for Inclo|&s;ures, wi&s;ely looked out for &s;uch as knew mo&s;t about wa&s;te lands.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy was plea&s;ed with all the&s;e &s;ubjects, and picked up &s;omething u&s;eful on each. It was a &s;aying of his, that mo&s;t men under&s;tood &s;ome one thing, and that he who was wi&s;e would try to learn from every man &s;omething on the &s;ubject he be&s;t knew; but Mr. Worthy made a further u&s;e of the whole. "What a pity it is," &s;aid he, "that Chri&s;tians are not as de&s;irous to turn their time to as good account as men of bu&s;ine&s;s are! When &s;hall we &s;ee religious per&s;ons as anxious to derive profit from the experience of others as the&s;e Farmers? When &s;hall we &s;ee them as eager to turn their time to good account? While I approve the&s;e men for not being <HI>slothful in business,</HI> let me improve the hint by being al&s;o <HI>fer|vent in spirit.</HI>"</P>
<P>When the hurry was a little over, Mr. Bragwell took a turn on the Bowling-green. Mr. Worthy followed him, to a&s;k
<PB N="29" REF="037134_0029_100C9298F0D5F7E8">
why the &s;ale of the e&s;tate was not brought forward. "Let the Auctioneer proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s," &s;aid he; "the company will be glad to get home by day light. I &s;peak mo&s;tly with a view to others for you, I do not think of being a purcha&s;er my&s;elf." &mdash;"I know it," &s;aid Bragwell, "or I would not be &s;uch a fool as to let the cat out of the bag. But is it po&s;&s;ible (proceed|ed he with a &s;mile of contempt) that you &s;hould think I will &s;ell my e&s;tate before dinner? Mr. Worthy, you are a clever man at books and &s;uch things; and per|haps can make out an account on paper in a hand&s;omer manner than I can. But I never found much to be got by fine writing. As to figures, I can carry enough of them in my head to add, divide, and multiply more money than your learning will ever give you the fingering of. You may beat me at a book, but you are a ve|ry child at a bargain. Sell my land be|fore dinner, indeed!"</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy was puzzled to gue&s;s how a man was to &s;hew more wi&s;dom by &s;el|ling a piece of ground at one hour than another, and de&s;ired an explanation. Bragwell felt rather more contempt for
<PB N="30" REF="037134_0030_100C929B75C80930">
his under&s;tanding than he had ever done before. "Look'ee, Mr. Worthy," &s;aid he, "I do not know that knowledge is of any u&s;e to a man unle&s;s he has &s;en&s;e enough to turn it to good account. Men are my books, Mr. Worthy, and it is by reading, &s;pelling, and putting them to|gether to good purpo&s;e, that I have got up in the world. I &s;hall give you a proof of this to-day. The&s;e Farmers are mo&s;t of them come to the Lion with a view of purcha&s;ing this bit of land of mine, if they &s;hould like the bargain. Now, as you know a thing can't be any great bar|gain to the buyer and the &s;eller too, to them and to me, it becomes me, as a man of &s;en&s;e, who has the good of his family at heart to &s;ecure the bargain to my&s;elf. I would not cheat any man, Sir, but I think it fair enough to turn his weakne&s;s to my own advantage; there is no law again&s;t that you know; and this is the u&s;e of one man's having more &s;en&s;e than another. So, whenever I have a bit of land to &s;ell, I always give a hand&s;ome dinner, with plenty of punch and &s;trong beer. We fill up the morning with other bu&s;ine&s;s, and I carefully keep back any talk about the purcha&s;e till we have dined.
<PB N="31" REF="037134_0031_100C929D63BAA6F8">
At dinner we have of cour&s;e a bit of po|litics. This puts mo&s;t of us into a pa&s;&s;ion, and you know anger is thir&s;ty. Be&s;ides, Church and King naturally bring on a good many other toa&s;ts. Now, as I am Ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t, you know it would be &s;habby in me to &s;ave my liquor, &s;o I pu&s;h about the gla&s;s one way and the tan|kard the other, till all my company are as merry as kings. Every man is delight|ed to &s;ee what a fine hearty fellow he has to deal with, and Mr. Bragwell receives a thou&s;and compliments. By this time they have gained as much in good humour as they have lo&s;t in &s;ober judgment, and this is the proper moment for &s;etting the Auctioneer to work, and this I commonly do to &s;uch good purpo&s;e, that I go home with my pur&s;e a &s;core or two of pounds heavier than if they had not been warmed by their dinner. In the morning men are cool and &s;u&s;picious, and have all their wits about them; but a cheerful gla&s;s cures all di&s;tru&s;t. And, what is lucky, I add to my credit as well as my pocket, and get more prai&s;e for my dinner than blame for my bargain."</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="037134_0032_100C929EF04FC088">Mr. Worthy was &s;truck with the ab&s;urd vanity which could tempt a man to own him&s;elf guilty of an unfair action for the &s;ake of &s;hewing his wi&s;dom. He was be|ginning to expre&s;s his di&s;approbation, when they were told dinner was on table. They went in and were &s;oon &s;eated. All was mirth and good cheer. Every body agreed that no one gave &s;uch hearty din|ners as Mr. Bragwell. Nothing was pitiful where he was ma&s;ter of the Fea&s;t. Bragwell who looked with plea&s;ure on the excellent dinner before him, and enjoyed the good account to which he &s;hould turn it, heard their prai&s;es with delight, and ca&s;t an eye on Worthy, as much as to &s;ay, "Who is the wi&s;e man now?" Having a mind to make his friend talk, he turned to him, &s;aying, "Mr. Worthy, I believe no people enjoy life more than men of our cla&s;s.
