<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR's of the 20th of <HI>May,</HI> I have received, in which you com|plain of the Extortion and Oppre&s;|&s;ion which is breaking in upon this People, and admire that the Go|vernment does not by &s;ome &s;utable Laws prevent it, more e&s;pecially you complain of the Gentlemen concerned in the Bank, and wonder how any Men can be &s;o blind as not to fore&s;ee the fatal Con&s;equences that would attend that Project.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, I mu&s;t inform you, That the Scheme the&s;e Bankers are come into is not the Scheme which was fir&s;t propo&s;ed: The fir&s;t Pro|po&s;al was to make <HI>One hundred thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> in Notes to be paid in to the Tru&s;tees of the Bank in ten Years, in Silver at <HI>twenty Shillings</HI> per Ounce; the Silver to remain in the Bank until the ten Years were expired, By this Me|thod
<PB N="3" REF="040100_0003_10162B5AF8F592D0">
we &s;hould have been &s;ure of <HI>One hundred thou&s;and Pounds</HI> pa&s;&s;ing among&s;t us to carry on our Trade, &amp; at the End of the ten Years there would have been <HI>One hundred thou&s;and Pounds</HI> in Silver to exchange for tho&s;e Bills, for it would not have been worth any Man's while to have lock'd up the&s;e Notes in their Che&s;ts for ten Years, through it might an&s;wer their End to lock them up for three Years as they now do; I mu&s;t &s;ay it was &s;urprizing to me to &s;ee the Gentlemen concerned in that Affair &s;o ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on and per&s;waded to alter the Scheme, and agree to have the Silver drawn out at three Periods, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> three Tenths at the End of three Years, and three Tenths more at the End of other three Years, and the remaining four Tenths at the End of the tenth Year: How doth this agree with their pretended De&s;ign in erecting this Bank; they pretended that their De&s;ign was to &s;upply the People with a Medium of Exchange, and under that Notion refu&s;ed letting in any to &s;ub&s;cribe who would not oblige them&s;elves to refu&s;e the <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> Bills emitted in 1733. Actions &s;peak louder than Words, and are more to be regarded: When they fir&s;t propo&s;ed this Alteration in their Scheme, they were told it would ruin their De&s;ign, for that the Bills or Notes would be hoarded up, and that it would rai&s;e the Price of Silver and Gold, in&s;tead of lowering the Price thereof, as they pretended it would do: I confe&s;s I was &s;ick of the Project when I heard that one Gentleman &s;igned <HI>ten thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> which was a tenth Part of the Stock, and that he and others for him in&s;i&s;ted on his having twenty Votes; to &s;uffer this I &s;aid
<PB N="4" REF="040100_0004_10162B6058465EE8">
was Di&s;traction in the Sub&s;cribers, and contrary to the Policy of all Nations: Power is u&s;ually Handmaid to Riches, therefore when Men of o|vergrown E&s;tates are gra&s;ping after Power, eve|ry where People have a jealous Eye over'em, lea&s;t they be &s;wallowed up by them before they are aware: I &s;uppo&s;e there never was the like In&s;tance in any Bank. In the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> South Sea, or India Stocks, any Man who hath <HI>One thou&s;and Pounds</HI> original Stock hath two Votes, and he who hath <HI>One hundred thou&s;and Pounds</HI> hath but four Votes, and the&s;e Banks are &s;ettled by Act of Parliament, &s;o careful is the Government to prevent the Rich oppre&s;&s;ing their poor Neighbours, and I &s;hall always be of Opinion, that the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> which is compo&s;ed of &s;o many wi&s;e, able State&s;men, and &s;o many ingenious Merchants, and have been in the Practice of the&s;e Things for Ages pa&s;t, are better Judges in &s;uch Matters than we who are but of Ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to &s;ee what the&s;e Men were driv|ing at who propo&s;ed drawing the Silver out at three Periods: But much the greate&s;t Part of the Sub&s;cribers were drawn in by others before they con&s;idered the Con&s;equences that would attend the Alteration, and now dearly repent and &s;ay they were impo&s;ed on, and all they have to &s;ay for them&s;elves is, alas, who would have thought that Men who &s;wim in abundance, and have as one would think more than Heart can wi&s;h, &s;hould &s;hew them&s;elves &s;o un&s;atiably Avaricious, &s;o Uncon&s;cionable and Unju&s;t as to pay Men <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> Bills and oblige them to
<PB N="5" REF="040100_0005_10162B62B7A0F780">
give Bonds to pay in Lieu thereof Merchants Notes, or on Failure of paying &s;uch Notes, to pay Silver at <HI>nineteen Shillings</HI> per Ounce, and at the &s;ame time the&s;e very Men are ingro&s;&s;ing the Notes, and give an Advance on them to get 'em all, if po&s;&s;ible, into their own Hands, that &s;o tho&s;e who have mortgaged their E&s;tates to them may never be able to redeem them, and &s;o of Con&s;equence &s;uch E&s;tates mu&s;t fall into their Hands for what they will be plea&s;ed to allow for them: I can't but pity tho&s;e who are ex|po&s;ed to the Mercy of &s;uch Men.</P>
<P>But to the&s;e Things the U&s;urer will reply and &s;ay, That it is at the Borrower's Election whether he will take up their Money on &s;uch Terms or no, and perhaps he will pretend it was out of pure Friend&s;hip and to &s;erve the Man that he lent him his Money, &amp;c. But will not every impartial Man who hears him &s;ay &s;o, laugh at all &s;uch idle Pretences; a Friend will rather abate of the common Intere&s;t than make any Advantage of his Friend's Nece&s;&s;ity: A Man ought not to exact on a Stranger, much le&s;s on his Friend: But the Right of the Matter is this, The Law of the Land ought to be a Rule to the U&s;urer in this Ca&s;e, that Man who can't be content with the common Intere&s;t, but will ex|act more than the Law hath &s;et Intere&s;t at, is a Breaker of the Law and oppre&s;&s;es his Neigh|bour; but notwith&s;tanding we have a good and whole&s;ome Law to prevent Men's taking exce&s;|&s;ive U&s;ury, many Men make no Scruple to ex|act <HI>ten</HI> per Cent for Loan of Money in Defiance of the Law; as I &s;aid before, the Law ought to
<PB N="6" REF="040100_0006_10162B652B0BDA08">
be kept &s;trictly unto, for if Men &s;werve from the Law, and it is winked at by the Govern|ment, it is like breaking down the Hedge or Wall, and letting in the wild Creatures to devour the Vineyard; and as to the frivolous Pretence that it is at the Election of the Borrower to take the Money or leave it, it is Nece&s;&s;ity that ob|liges Men to take up Money when they give more than the common Intere&s;t, and that the Lender knows very well, and no Man ought to make another Man's Nece&s;&s;ity his Opportunity, and take Advantage thereof to &s;queeze and op|pre&s;s him: Let us eat and drink to day, for to morrow we die; rather than go into a Goal Men will comply with any Terms be they never &s;o hard and unrea&s;onable: And it is for this Rea|&s;on that the Legi&s;lator makes Laws to re&s;train the Corruptions &amp; vicious Inclinations of Men, without which Laws Men would prey upon one another like Fi&s;h in the Sea, the greater would devour the le&s;s: But yet notwith&s;tanding the good Laws we have to prevent this Evil from &s;preading among&s;t us, it is too much practi&s;ed at this Day to the Ruin of many Families, and if &s;ome &s;peedy Remedy be not found out to pre|vent it, a few U&s;urers will &s;oon eat up the Sub|&s;tance which many indu&s;trious People have been many Years &s;craping together, in Hopes that their Children would reap the Benefit of it.</P>
<P>As to what you &s;ay about the Government's interpo&s;ing their Authority to prevent the De|&s;truction of &s;o many Families as are in Danger of being ruined by this vile Bank, I am inform|ed it was propo&s;ed in the A&s;&s;embly to make our
<PB N="7" REF="040100_0007_10162B67E24FC488">
Province Bills a lawful Tender for them; how that Matter came to be dropt I know not, it is great Pity it was not pro&s;ecuted to Effect, for &s;uch an Act would have been of great Service, not only to tho&s;e who have mortgaged their E&s;|tates for the&s;e Bank Notes, or have borrowed Money on Bond, to pay in the&s;e Notes or in Sil|ver, but to the greate&s;t Part of the Bankers them|&s;elves, who groan under the Burthen when the Time comes to pay in their Silver, for it hath rai&s;ed the Price of Silver to <HI>Twenty &s;even Shillings and &s;ix Pence</HI> per Ounce; what dreadful Sufferers then are they like to be, who as &s;oon as they received their Money out of this Bank, put it a|way immediately to pay their Debts, and never had the Advantage of making any profitable Improvement of it, it hath been a very un|happy Bank to &s;uch Men, their Ca&s;e calls for Pity.</P>
<P>The Objections made by &s;ome in the A&s;&s;em|bly again&s;t making the Province Bills a lawful Tender for the&s;e Notes are, Fir&s;t, They make a Matter of Con&s;cience of it, to oblige a Man to take any thing for his Bond, other than what is mentioned in the Condition. And Secondly, They &s;ay it will be a Means of having the Pro|vince Bills hoarded up; In An&s;wer to the&s;e Rea|&s;ons, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, That the Government have in their great Wi&s;dom, with great Ju&s;tice and in Compa&s;&s;ion to the Poor, as well becomes the Fathers of the People, made the Bills of this Province a lawful Tender for any Debt that &s;hould be contracted after the making that Law, &s;o that no Per&s;on may be impri&s;oned who ten|ders
<PB N="8" REF="040100_0008_10162B6BA6C575F8">
tho&s;e Bills for Payment; and &s;hall the &s;ame Government &s;ee a few Men i&s;&s;ue out their own Notes as a Bank, and call <HI>nineteen Shillings</HI> of tho&s;e Notes an Ounce of Silver, and take Bonds for them accordingly? Shall U&s;urers as they come to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of the&s;e Notes, call in their Bonds and Morgages, and oblige their Debtors to give new Bonds and Mortgages, payable in the&s;e Notes, or Silver at <HI>nineteen Shillings</HI> per Ounce? Shall a few mercenary Men &s;o prey up|on their nece&s;&s;itous Neighbours, as to pay them <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> Bills, &amp; oblige them to give Bonds or Mortgages to pay in Lieu thereof Bank Notes or an Ounce of Silver for every <HI>nineteen Shillings,</HI> when an Ounce of Silver is worth <HI>twenty-&s;even Shillings and &s;ix Pence,</HI> and ri&s;ing, and will be at <HI>thirty Shillings</HI> per Ounce before the Year comes about, if this Bank continues as it is, I &s;ay will the Government &s;uffer &s;uch horrid Inju&s;tice? No &s;urely. No Chri&s;tian can hear the&s;e Things and not be deeply affected at the Thoughts of &s;uch mon&s;trous Extortion and Oppre&s;&s;ion breaking in like a Torrent upon the People, much le&s;s will a Chri&s;tian Government &s;uffer it: But I have heard &s;ome of the&s;e Bankers &s;ay, It is not in the Power of the Government to do any thing to relieve the People in this Matter: To which I reply and &s;ay, When a Phy&s;ician finds his Pa|tients Ca&s;e extremely hazardous, he will ven|ture to go further than in ordinary Ca&s;es, de&s;|perate Di&s;ea&s;es call for extraordinary Remedies, even &s;o when the State is di&s;ordered and Ex|tortion and Oppre&s;&s;ion comes rowling over a Peo|ple like the raging Sea, and all Things are run|ning into Confu&s;ion; whence can we expect
<PB N="9" REF="040100_0009_10162B6E31DD32A0">
Relief but from the Government who are cloath|ed with Power for that very End, and GOD ex|pects it from them; that they be Eyes to the blind, and Feet to the lame, and deliver the Poor out of the Hands of their Oppre&s;&s;ors: The Rich are always able to help them&s;elves, and it is in their Power, very often, to oppre&s;s their Neigh|bours, if the Government do not take Care to prevent it, and their A&s;&s;i&s;tance was never more wanted than at this Day to deliver this poor op|pre&s;&s;ed, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People out of the Hands of the Rich and Mighty: I believe every di&s;in|tere&s;ted Man in the Province will &s;ay, That he who receives <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> Bills, ought to pay in the &s;ame, and all others ought to pay in Bills of this Province. Shall any Man's Note be better than the Money of the Government e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by the Law of the Land and confirmed by the King? Can there be any Inju&s;tice in mak|ing a Law to oblige every Man who hath paid <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Bills to accept the &s;ame for any Spe|cialties for which he paid no other than tho&s;e Bills, and to oblige all others to receive the Bills of this Government in lieu of the Merchants Notes? No, I know it is the Opinion of many good Men and rich Men too among&s;t us, That &s;uch a Law would do a great deal of Good, and do no Inju&s;tice to any Man: Mo&s;t certainly it would do this Good, it would bring abroad the Merchants Notes, we &s;hou'd &s;oon &s;ee them abroad circulating in Trade and doing the Office for which it was pretended they were made, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> pa&s;s from Man to Man to facilitate our Payments in in our Commerce, and I am per&s;waded that nine Tenths of the Bankers were concerned with no
<PB N="10" REF="040100_0010_10162B6FBB948C58">
other Views, but that the whole People &s;hould reap that Benefit by the Circulation of the Notes; but when it was propo&s;ed to draw 'em in at three Periods, no Man that wou'd be&s;tow a Thought on it, could think they ever would Circulate or do the lea&s;t Good to the Trade, or to People in general, but quite the contrary: It was ea&s;y to &s;ee that &s;ome Men would build great E&s;tates by them, and that many Families would be ruined by them. And can this be thought to be for the Good of the Publick? All Men know that the middling Sort of People are the greate&s;t Sup|port to the common Wealth, they pay the great|e&s;t Part to &s;upport both Church and State. But we, in the Method we are in, &s;hall in a little Time have no middling Sort, we &s;hall have a few, and but a very few Lords, and all the re&s;t Beggars: Some there are among us who &s;ay there is Money enough, and that there is no Want of Money with them to whom the Money belongs; as if Money was de&s;igned only for a few rich Men to lye in their Che&s;ts, until a lucky Oppor|tunity offers it &s;elf for them to make their Mar|ket with on their poor Neighbours: I confe&s;s the&s;e Men's Notions concerning Money, va&s;tly differs from mine: I think every Man is Intitled to Money, as much as the riche&s;t Man among&s;t us; I mean to &s;o much as he Earns; the Trade&s;|men and Labourers ought to receive their Mo|ney as &s;oon as their Work is done, and not be turned away to Shops, <HI>or perhaps to a Shop for their Pay:</HI> The Labourers at this Day will work for <HI>Six Shillings</HI> per Day in Money rather than for <HI>Seven Shillings</HI> in Goods, and I believe it is their Intere&s;t &s;o to do, I confe&s;s, I &s;hall never
<PB N="11" REF="040100_0011_10162B714D747D10">
think there is Money enough till poor Men can get Money for their Labour, and have it in their Power to lay it out where they can be be&s;t u&s;ed, and not be obliged to go to &s;uch a particular Shop for their Pay becau&s;e their Imployer deals with that Shop and no other, which is the Ca&s;e of many in this Town every Day, and it is to be feared, &s;ome Shopkeepers u&s;e but little Con&s;ci|ence with &s;uch Cu&s;tomers, but make 'em pay dear|ly for what they have.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Objection &s;ome make again&s;t the Province Bills being made a lawful Tender for the Merchants Notes is, That in lieu of hoarding up the&s;e Notes, they will then hoard up the Pro|vince Bills: But I confe&s;s I can &s;ee no weight at all in this Argument, for the&s;e Notes are mo&s;tly in the Hands of the Merchants who made 'em, and now keep 'em on Purpo&s;e to make a Market of 'em by leting 'em out to receive Sil|ver at <HI>Nineteen Shillings</HI> per Ounce in lieu of them, and they never will come abroad until there be &s;uch a Law made. But admit it &s;hould have that Tendency as they pretend, we &s;hou'd be much better than we are now with Re&s;pect to our Trade; for we &s;hould then as I &s;aid be|fore, have the Notes abroad Circulating in Pay|ment, and that would prevent hundreds of Law|&s;uits which are brought into the Courts only through the &s;carcity of Money. This Con&s;ide|ration alone methinks &s;hould induce the Gene|ral Court to make the Province Bills a lawful Tender for them. But add to this the mighty Advantage it would be to many poor Men who&s;e pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ities have obliged 'em to Mortgage
<PB N="12" REF="040100_0012_10162B75A4213CB0">
their E&s;tates for the&s;e Notes, who if &s;omething be not done for their Relief will be obliged to pay forty per Cent for the Money they have &s;o borrowed, over and above the common Intere&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law. But I can't believe the Pro|vince Bills will be hoarded up more than they now are, if there were &s;uch a Law; for every Man who keeps any Money by him, keeps our Province Bills as long as he can, it is the la&s;t Money he will part with. We &s;ee very few of 'em abroad, we have little el&s;e but <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> Bills to go to Market with from Day to Day to buy our Provi&s;ions with. To &s;peak plain, our Mi&s;|fortune is, we have a few lucky Men among us who have had the good Fortune to rai&s;e con&s;iderable E&s;tates from nothing within the&s;e twenty or thirty Years: the&s;e Men are for &s;inking all paper Mediums, and &s;ay, If the paper Bills were once gone we &s;hou'd have Silver among us; but I confe&s;s I can't be of their Opinion, I rather think we mu&s;t have a paper Medium or none at all: While the Ballance of our Trade with <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is &s;o much in their Favour, all our Silver and Gold which we Import from other Places, will go to <HI>England</HI> to Ballance that Account, we &s;hall have none of it &s;tay with us until we can find a Way to live more Independent of them: And every Scheme that can be projected to bring in Silver, will mo&s;t certainly be attend|ed with the &s;ame Inconveniencies which have attended the Merchants Notes. I wi&s;h &s;ome Method could be found out to revive our dying Trade, for I &s;ee nothing but Poverty and Mi&s;ery before us in the Way we are in; our Neighbours at <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> Thrive and grow Rich while
<PB N="13" REF="040100_0013_10162B7926C070D0">
we decline every Year; they &s;it ea&s;y, the Inte|re&s;t of their Money out on Loan pays the whole Charge of the Government, while we are loaded with Taxes, more e&s;pecially this Town, we &s;et at a very great Charge, more then the People will be able to pay, unle&s;s &s;ome Way can be found out to enliven our Trade, which I am of opinion mu&s;t be by &s;upplying the People with Money, or a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in &s;upplying them|&s;elves in a private Way.</P>
<P>It &s;eems very &s;trange, that Men who have rai&s;ed them&s;elves and Families from no|thing by the Help of our Province Bills, &s;hould be &s;uch bitter Enemies to a Paper Medium; I am &s;ure it is pa&s;t the Art of Man to make Silver pa&s;s as Money unle&s;s you can prevent the Silver which comes in being &s;hip'd off again: If &s;ome Way be not found out to &s;upply the Trade with &s;ome Medium or other, to buy and &s;ell with and pay our Debts with, our Trade will &s;ink and come to nothing, and Poverty will &s;oon over|&s;pread the whole Land, both Town and Coun|try: We in this and the other Sea Ports will be fir&s;t affected with it, but the whole Land will feel the &s;ad Effect of it in a little Time: We may &s;peak as contemptibly as we plea&s;e of the <HI>Rhode-I&s;landers</HI> emitting Bills, they have found the Sweet of it, for they have eaten up half our Trade with it, and will &s;oon eat us out of all if we don't contrive &s;ome &s;ort of Money to pa&s;s a|mong&s;t us: It is ea&s;y for us to have a better Medium than what we now have, for we have nothing but <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> Bills pa&s;&s;ing among us, whereas if we had a Medium of our own we
<PB N="14" REF="040100_0014_1016201D02812CA0">
might &s;oon &s;ink all their Bills, but to talk of refu&s;ing to take them, before we can have &s;ome other Medium to an&s;wer in Lieu of them, &s;eems very &s;trange, it is Nece&s;&s;ity alone which gives them a Currency: Did ever any trading Place pretend to carry on their Trade without &s;ome &s;ort of Money; I believe every Nation under the Sun have &s;omething pa&s;&s;ing among&s;t them, which an&s;wers in&s;tead thereof. It is evident that the Heathen in this Land had their Wampum which pa&s;&s;ed among&s;t them, and no doubt, was in as much E&s;teem with them as Silver is with us, and with it they traded; the Inland Country &s;upplied tho&s;e who dwelt on the Sea Coa&s;t with Furs, &amp;c. for Cloathing, and they who dwelt on the Sea Coa&s;t &s;upplied the Country with Fi&s;h, Fowl, &amp;c. according to the different Sea&s;ons of the Year. I have heard &s;ome Gentlemen cry up this Merchants Bank for the be&s;t Paper Money that ever was made, but I think I have plainly pro|ved it to be ju&s;t the Rever&s;e; had they &s;tuck to the fir&s;t Propo&s;al it would have been of general Service for eight or nine Years, but &s;ome Gen|tlemen had not Patience to wait &s;o long for the Silver, which proved the Ruin of the Scheme. To Conclude, Happy &s;hould we be if we always bore in mind tho&s;e wi&s;e Sayings left us upon Record; <HI>Riches profit not in the Day of Wrath; a little that a righteous Man hath is better than the Trea&s;ures of many Wicked.</HI></P>
