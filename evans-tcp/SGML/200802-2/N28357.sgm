<BIBL>JOHN IV. 23.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor&s;hippers &s;hall wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit and in truth; for the Father &s;eeketh &s;uch to wor&s;hip him.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO wor&s;hip God is a <HI>duty,</HI> that hath been generally acknowledg|ed by mankind; and, in all ages and countries, there have been in&s;titutions of religion. It is a <HI>duty</HI> enjoined by <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> and en|forced by <HI>divine revelation.</HI> Even tho&s;e, who were favored with no written revelation of the will of God, might <HI>clearly</HI> &s;ee, <HI>by the vi&s;ible things which were made, his eternal power and godhead,</HI> and be left <HI>without excu&s;e,</HI> if they neglected to wor&s;hip and adore him. And frequently are we called upon, in the Scriptures, to attend to this important duty. The P&s;almi&s;t exhorts; <HI>O come, let us wor&s;hip and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker, for he is our God.</HI> Our Saviour has &s;aid; <HI>thou &s;halt wor&s;hip the Lord thy God.</HI> And the Apo&s;tles have taught us, both by precept and example, <HI>Not to for&s;ake the a&s;|&s;embling
<PB N="6" REF="037789_0004_100F512403670478">
of our&s;elves together,</HI> for divine wor&s;hip, <HI>as the manner of &s;ome is.</HI> But, notwith&s;tanding mankind have been in all ages, generally agreed, in con&s;ider|ing divine wor&s;hip as an important duty, it is to be lamented that religious in&s;titutions have, at the &s;ame time, been &s;o generally abu&s;ed. A &s;mall acquaint|ance with the hi&s;tory of mankind, will &s;hew us, that great indeed have been the mi&s;chiefs of mi&s;taken zeal; of zeal contending, not only about <HI>doctrines,</HI> but <HI>places</HI> and <HI>modes</HI> of religious wor&s;hip. Religious in&s;titutions, which were de&s;igned to promote <HI>love to God, peace on earth,</HI> and <HI>good will to men,</HI> have been perverted, by &s;uper&s;tition and enthu&s;ia&s;m, to the purpo&s;es of di&s;cord, and bloody per&s;ecution. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, knowing what was in man, &s;eems, in the pa&s;&s;age here cited from the Go&s;pel, to have intended totally to prevent the&s;e evils, by plainly declaring, that neither particular <HI>place</HI> nor <HI>mode</HI> of wor&s;hip, &s;hould be of any intrin&s;ic value under the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation; that the local and peculiar wor&s;hip of Judai&s;m was to give way to a wor&s;hip of a more exalted nature; that the <HI>hour was now come, when the true wor&s;hippers &s;hould wor&s;hip the Father, in &s;pirit and in truth:</HI> Not with the painful rites and ceremonies required by the law, which were only <HI>&s;hadows of things to come;</HI> but with that more &s;ub|lime and &s;piritual wor&s;hip which &s;hould &s;uit the genius of Chri&s;tianity; <HI>for the Father,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>&s;eeketh &s;uch to wor&s;hip him.</HI></P>
<P>The text, con&s;idered in its connexion, di&s;covers to us, not only the <HI>nature</HI> of Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, but al&s;o the <HI>rea&s;on</HI> of God's various dealings with the children of men; that, "while he &s;its enthroned in the glories of unchangeable wi&s;dom, he conde&s;cends to the weakne&s;s of his creatures, and adapts his laws to their various &s;ituations and capacity."</P>

"At the time of the migration of the Jews from Egypt," &s;ays a learned Divine,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Family Lectures, Vol. II, Serm, LXXXII.</NOTE> "the whole world was &s;unk into idolatry. They alone were ble&s;&s;ed with the knowledge of the true God: Yet even they were perpetually relap&s;ing into the ab&s;urdities of idol wor&s;hip. Hence that load of peculiar ceremo|nies was impo&s;ed on them; all tending, by various means, to one great end; that of keeping them pure from idolatry, of &s;eparating them from the wor&s;hip of the Pagan nations that &s;urrounded them, and of confirming them in that of the true God. To this end, the temple was built and the wor&s;hip e&s;tabli&s;h|ed at Jeru&s;alem. Hither the whole nation was obliged to re&s;ort at &s;tated times, to prevent their re|lap&s;e into idolatry. The Samaritans were a &s;ect, who had divided from the Jews, and for the &s;ame ends had built a temple on Mount Gerizim, where they likewi&s;e periodically performed the ceremonies enjoined by the law. The&s;e ceremonies, and this &s;eparation of the Jews from the Gentiles, were de|&s;igned by Providence to be continued till the coming of Chri&s;t. But now a glorious change was to take place. The world was, by this time, prepared, by higher degrees of knowledge, for the reception of the Go&s;pel. This was the hour appointed, for the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s to ari&s;e, for his light to be &s;pread over the face of the whole earth. Every circum|&s;tance and ceremony was now to be done away that tended to keep up the former &s;eparation; nothing was to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, but what tended to the general union of mankind; and the peculiar, the local and periodical wor&s;hip of Jeru&s;alem, was to be &s;wallowed up in that more &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation, which was de&s;igned to produce univer&s;al peace and charity."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="037789_0006_100F5126DE49B920">
This being the de&s;ign of Providence, in its various di&s;pen&s;ations, we may only attend to the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> that introduced the words of our text, in order to di&s;|cover at once its meaning and propriety.</P>
<P>As our Saviour journeyed from Judea to Galilee, he pa&s;&s;ed through Samaria. Being fatigued with his journey, he &s;at down by a well and &s;ent his di&s;ci|ples into the city to procure &s;ome provi&s;ions for their refre&s;hment. While they were gone, there came a Samaritan woman to draw water. Our Saviour &s;aith unto her, <HI>woman, give me to drink.</HI> Knowing him to be a Jew, by his dre&s;s, or dialect, &s;he was much &s;urpri&s;ed at his reque&s;t. She thinks it &s;trange that he did not manife&s;t the &s;ame ob&s;tinate temper towards the Samaritans that the Jews had con&s;tantly done. She wonders that he &s;hould conde&s;cend to a&s;k this kindne&s;s of her; for it was the pride of the Jews, "that they would endure any hard&s;hip and &s;uffering, rather than be beholden to a Samaritan." <HI>How is it,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>that thou, being a Jew, a&s;keth drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria; for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</HI> Their di&s;cour&s;e being thus introduced, our Lord improves the occa|&s;ion, to in&s;truct her in &s;piritual and divine things. He acquaints her of the water of life, that grace of God, which refre&s;hes the thir&s;ty &s;oul and prepares it for eternal felicity. He opens to her memory many of the &s;cenes of her pa&s;t life, and convinced her that he was a <HI>Prophet,</HI> or one that was endued with extraordinary communications from the Divine Being. Anxious for further in&s;truction, &s;he wi&s;e|ly improves the opportunity to inquire concern|ing that di&s;pute which had &s;o long kept up the mo&s;t bitter enmity between the Jews and the Samaritans. <HI>Our fathers,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>wor&s;hipped in this mountain; and ye &s;ay,</HI> i. e. the Jews &s;ay, <HI>that in Jeru&s;alem is the place where
<PB N="9" REF="037789_0007_100F514E189D6FF8">
men ought to wor&s;hip.</HI> It was agreed between the Jews and Samaritans, that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> ought to be wor&s;hipped &s;ome where, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">gious wor&s;hip was a matter of very great importance. But the &s;ubject of vari|ance was, <HI>where,</HI> i. e. in what particular place they &s;hould wor&s;hip God. Je&s;us &s;aith unto her, <HI>woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye &s;hall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jeru&s;alem wor&s;hip the Father:&mdash;But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor&s;hip|pers &s;hall wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit and in truth; for the Father &s;eeketh &s;uch to wor&s;hip him.</HI></P>
<P>The Jews and Samaritans were both expecting the hour to come, when, either by &s;ome divine revela|tion, or &s;ome &s;ignal providence, this matter &s;hould be decided, either in favor of Jeru&s;alem or of Mount Gerizim. But how differently was it decided from the expectations of either party! The <HI>object</HI> of wor|&s;hip is indeed &s;till to continue the &s;ame. The Jews wor&s;hipped God under the character of a <HI>Father,</HI> and &s;o did doubtle&s;s the Samaritans. This part is &s;till to remain. But a period is now put to all nicene&s;s and all differences about the place of wor&s;hip. The di&s;&s;olution of the Jewi&s;h economy, and the erecting of the evangelical &s;tate, "have &s;et this matter at large," as one expre&s;&s;es it, &s;o that it is a thing per|fectly indifferent in what particular places men wor|&s;hip God. The wor&s;hip of God is not now, under the Go&s;pel, appropriated to any particular place, as it was under the law; but it is required, <HI>that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.</HI> Our rea&s;on teaches us to con&s;ult de|cency and convenience, in the places of wor&s;hip; but our religion gives no preference to one place above another, in re&s;pect of holine&s;s and acceptable|ne&s;s to God.</P>
<P><PB REF="037789_0008_100F5129A3F49AE8">
It is now required of all that wor&s;hip God, that they wor&s;hip him <HI>in &s;pirit and in truth.</HI> A change has taken place in the nature of the wor&s;hip. Chri&s;|tians wor&s;hip God, not in the ceremonial ob&s;ervances of the Mo&s;aic in&s;titution, but in &s;piritual ordinances; con&s;i&s;ting le&s;s in external parade, but animated and invigorated with a divine power and energy. The wor&s;hip, which Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted, is rational and intellectual, and refined from tho&s;e external rites with which the wor&s;hip of the Jews was clouded. There is al&s;o, under the Go&s;pel, a change in the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the wor&s;hippers. True chri&s;tians wor&s;hip God <HI>in the &s;pirit.</HI> They depend upon the holy &s;pirit of God, for &s;trength and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, yielding their &s;ouls to his influences and ope|rations. They devote their own &s;pirits to, and em|ploy them in, the &s;ervice of God. They wor&s;hip him, with &s;teadine&s;s of mind, with pure affections, and with all the powers of their &s;ouls. They al&s;o wor&s;hip him <HI>in truth;</HI> i. e. with &s;incerity of heart; without any di&s;gui&s;e or hypocri&s;y. They have <HI>truth in the inward part,</HI> as the P&s;almi&s;t expre&s;&s;es it. They regard the <HI>power</HI> more than the <HI>form</HI> of Godline&s;s; they aim at the divine glory, more than to be &s;een of men; and draw near to God with a pure heart.</P>
<P>Several rea&s;ons may be offered, why mankind &s;hould wor&s;hip God <HI>in &s;pirit and in truth.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e, under the Go&s;pel, they only are the true wor&s;hippers, and they only will be accepted. <HI>The Father &s;eeketh &s;uch to wor&s;hip him.</HI> This implies that &s;uch wor&s;hip is nece&s;&s;ary in order to meet with the approbation of Heaven. When God comes to judge the world by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, it will not be of any importance, <HI>where</HI> mankind have wor&s;hipped the Father; but in what <HI>manner</HI> they have done it:&mdash;Whether they have put on the external &s;anctity of
<PB N="11" REF="037789_0009_100F5150DB67BF40">
the hypocrite; or, whether they have wor&s;hipped <HI>in &s;pirit and in truth.</HI> Again,</P>
<P>Our Saviour has ob&s;erved, that <HI>God is a &s;pirit,</HI> and offered that as another rea&s;on, why he &s;hould be wor|&s;hipped <HI>in &s;pirit and in truth.</HI> The &s;pirituality of the divine nature is a very good rea&s;on for the &s;piritu|ality of divine wor&s;hip. If we do not wor&s;hip God, who is a &s;pirit, <HI>in &s;pirit and in truth,</HI> we neither give him <HI>the glory due unto his name,</HI> nor can we rea|&s;onably hope for his favor and acceptance.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, that the words of our text were de|&s;igned to &s;hew, that the time had already come, when men &s;hould no longer confine their wor&s;hip of God, to any particular <HI>place,</HI> nor adhere to any par|ticular <HI>mode,</HI> but &s;hould <HI>wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit and in truth:</HI> That the whole "univer&s;e is his tem|ple, and all &s;pace his abode;" and that one particu|lar place, in it&s;elf con&s;idered, is no more acceptable to him than another; that the &s;incerity and purity of the <HI>heart</HI> is what God chiefly requires.</P>
<P>But as, in avoiding one extreme, it hath too often been the fate of mankind to run into its oppo&s;ite; &s;o here, this declaration of our Saviour in the text, which implies only the abolition of the ceremonial law, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a more pure and &s;pir|itual wor&s;hip, has been frequently mi&s;apprehended, as being an expre&s;s licence for neglecting all exter|nal ceremonies in religion, and even all public wor|&s;hip. But the examples of the Apo&s;tles and primi|tive di&s;play of Chri&s;t, are &s;ufficient to convince mankind, that our text was never de&s;igned to de&s;troy all public in&s;titutions of religion; but to &s;hew the purity and &s;pirituality of that wor&s;hip, which, under the Go&s;pel, &s;hould &s;ucceed the pompous and local wor&s;hip of the Jews. We have not only the exam|ples of the fir&s;t chri&s;tians a&s;&s;embling for public wor|&s;hip;
<PB N="12" REF="037789_0010_100F512E04C5FC20">
but we re po&s;itively commanded, <HI>not to for|&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling of our&s;elves together as the manner of &s;ome is.</HI> And indeed, while we are in our pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate, it will be found nece&s;&s;ary, on im|partial inquiry, to attend to the public in&s;titutions of religion, in order to accompli&s;h that great purpo&s;e of wor&s;hipping God <HI>in &s;pirit and in truth.</HI></P>
<P>Let us then inquire into the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> and <HI>u&s;efulne&s;s</HI> of public wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="1">1. The public in&s;titutions of religion are nece&s;&s;a|ry; becau&s;e without them, mankind in general would relap&s;e into a &s;tate of barbari&s;m and a total forgetfulne&s;s of all religion. "I believe," &s;ays an excellent writer,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. JOHN BROWN, Chaplain to the Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le.</NOTE> "it is no breach of truth or char|ity, to affirm that a great part of mankind are &s;o im|mer&s;ed in bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure, that they &s;eldom turn their thoughts on God, &s;eldom recollect either their obligations to him, or their dependance on him, ex|cept only when they are drawn by the &s;tated returns of public wor&s;hip. Some indeed are &s;o hardened that they are deaf to every call; but much greater numbers are &s;wayed by the power of cu&s;tom, and yield to the rules of decency, when they would &s;corn tho&s;e of duty." A&s;&s;embling together affords al&s;o opportunities for moral and religious in&s;truction to tho&s;e who would otherwi&s;e receive none. "In all Prote&s;tant countries, the elements of natural religion, and the important parts of the evangelical hi&s;tory, are familiar to the lowe&s;t of the people. This gen|eral diffu&s;ion of knowledge among&s;t all orders of chri&s;tians, which will appear a great thing when compared with the intellectual condition of barba|rous nations, cannot fairly, I think, be a&s;cribed to any other cau&s;e, than the regular e&s;tabli&s;hment of
<PB N="13" REF="037789_0011_100F515293059548">
a&s;&s;embling for divine wor&s;hip."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See PALEY's Moral Philo&s;ophy, Chapter IV.</NOTE> In the&s;e a&s;&s;em|blies, there are none perhaps, who receive not &s;ome temporary impre&s;&s;ions of religion, which, though they work not their entire and full effect, though they be &s;oon <HI>choaked</HI> by the cares and plea&s;ures of the world, yet keep tho&s;e cares and plea&s;ures from &s;wal|lowing up the &s;oul in a <HI>total degeneracy.</HI> Others, perhaps, are awakened from the delu&s;ion of &s;in, to a &s;en&s;e of the importance of piety and religion, are rou&s;ed from their lethargy of &s;oul, to li&s;ten to the warning voice, which bids them return to the <HI>right way and walk in it.</HI> The&s;e rea&s;ons bind all the mem|bers of a community to uphold public wor&s;hip by their pre&s;ence and example.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the direct nece&s;&s;ity of public wor&s;hip, in order to improve the minds and morals of man|kind, there are other valuable advantages to be de|rived from the immediate attendance on this duty.</P>
<P N="1">1. Joining in prayer and prai&s;es to their common Creator, has a &s;en&s;ible tendency to unite mankind together, and to cheri&s;h and enlarge the generous affections. When they acknowledge them&s;elves &s;prung from the &s;ame original, "preparing together for the period of all worldly di&s;tinctions, reminded of their mutual infirmities, and common dependen|cy, imploring and receiving &s;upport from the &s;ame great &s;ource of power and bounty, having all one intere&s;t to &s;ecure, one Lord to &s;erve, one judg|ment, the &s;upreme object of all their hopes and fears to look towards, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible, in this po&s;ition, to behold mankind as &s;trangers or enemies, or not to regard them as children of the &s;ame family a&s;&s;em|bled before their common Parent, and with &s;ome portion of the tenderne&s;s that belongs to the mo&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="037789_0012_100F5131E51CB3B0">
endearing of our dome&s;tic relations." It is not to be expected, however, that any &s;ingle attendance on divine wor&s;hip &s;hould produce any con&s;iderable or la&s;ting effect of this kind; but the frequent return of &s;uch &s;entiments and feelings as are naturally ex|cited by the pre&s;ence of a devout congregation, may &s;often many unkind pa&s;&s;ions, and produce in time, with the ble&s;&s;ing of God, a mo&s;t exten&s;ive and per|manent benevolence.</P>
<P>Again, "A&s;&s;emblies for the purpo&s;e of divine wor&s;hip, placing men under impre&s;&s;ions, by which they are taught to con&s;ider their relation to the Deity and to contemplate tho&s;e around them, with a view to that relation, force upon their thoughts the nat|ural equality of the human &s;pecies, and thereby pro|mote humility and conde&s;cention, in the highe&s;t orders of the community, and in&s;pire the lowe&s;t with a &s;en&s;e of their rights." Mankind are apt to make too great di&s;tinctions with re&s;pect to the different &s;ituations of men in the pre&s;ent life. Honor, wealth and power are too much the idols of the world.&mdash;But all cla&s;&s;es and di&s;tinctions of men uniting to|gether to wor&s;hip and adore their common Lord and Ma&s;ter has a happy tendency to improve the charac|ter of both high and low, and to impre&s;s on their minds a &s;en&s;e of their natural equality. Ruler and &s;ubject, rich and poor are di&s;tinctions that will con|tinue among men no longer than during the contin|uance of this &s;hort life; and tho&s;e di&s;tinctions are almo&s;t lo&s;t, when mankind are con&s;idered in a rela|tion to the great Creator and Governor of the uni|ver&s;e. <HI>Great</HI> then mu&s;t be the <HI>utility</HI> of public wor|&s;hip, being calculated to produce &s;uch happy effects. But be&s;ide the&s;e great effects, we mu&s;t not forget the powerful influence of <HI>example</HI> in the public wor&s;hip of God. By <HI>example,</HI> I mean, not only that which
<PB N="15" REF="037789_0013_100F5155A4BBAFC0">
excites imitation in the external acts of wor&s;hip; but, "that <HI>&s;ympathy of &s;oul</HI> &s;o &s;trongly prevalent in human nature." The pa&s;&s;ions of mankind are con|tageous. Fear, hope, grief and joy, &s;hining forth in the countenance of our fellow creatures, &s;trike them|&s;elves into our hearts, and awaken corre&s;ponding feelings in the &s;oul. Thus the &s;ight of a congrega|tion, &s;eriou&s;ly united in wor&s;hip, naturally in&s;pires additional degrees of piety and reverence.</P>
<P>From this brief di&s;play of the &s;ubject before us, we di&s;cern the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> and <HI>utility</HI> of public wor&s;hip, even in accompli&s;hing that great purpo&s;e of wor|&s;hipping God in <HI>&s;pirit and in truth.</HI> And in con&s;e|quence of the truths brought to view, in the preced|ing di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall now add a few ob&s;ervations adapted to the occa&s;ion of our a&s;&s;embling together, at this time, and then clo&s;e.

We may ob&s;erve, that as God, under the Go&s;|pel, has required us to wor&s;hip him in <HI>&s;pirit and in truth,</HI> without confining his wor&s;hip to any particu|lar <HI>place</HI> or <HI>mode,</HI> we &s;hould exerci&s;e mutual forbear|ance and charity towards all chri&s;tians, though they may not unite with us in the &s;ame <HI>place</HI> and <HI>mode</HI> of religious wor&s;hip. As we live in a land of civil and religious liberty, all chri&s;tians have a right to con|&s;ult their own <HI>convenience</HI> in choo&s;ing their places for religious wor&s;hip; and their <HI>own con&s;ciences</HI> with regard to the mode. Though the convenience of an individual, or of a few, ought, many times, to be &s;acrificed to the public good; yet when a number of chri&s;tians can con&s;ult their own convenience with|out any injury to others, they have an undoubted <HI>right</HI> &s;o to do; and this <HI>right</HI> ought to be &s;ecured to them by the laws of their country. And if the laws will not permit them to enjoy this right, they are forced to &s;uffer, in this particular, an <HI>unrea&s;ona|ble deprivation</HI> of liberty.</P>

Be&s;ides: Too great an attachment to particular <HI>places</HI> and <HI>modes</HI> of wor&s;hip has been often attended with pernicious con&s;equences. It has cheri&s;hed a &s;pirit of pride and vain glory, and expelled chri&s;tian charity and all tho&s;e amiable virtues, which ought ever to reign in the human heart. Different &s;ects and denominations of chri&s;tians, who have placed their whole religion in their peculiar <HI>places</HI> and <HI>modes</HI> of wor&s;hip, "have branded each other with the mo&s;t odious names, and conducted towards each other with &s;uch mutual hatred and uncharitablene&s;s, as became a reproach to the pure and holy religion they pro|fe&s;&s;ed." Churches and &s;ocieties of different opinions with regard to the externals of religion; and even members of the &s;ame church and &s;ociety cannot be happy, without exerci&s;ing mutual forbearance and charity. We are here in an imperfect &s;tate, and lia|ble to deception and error. The different capacities and different opportunities of improvement among mankind, render it impo&s;&s;ible, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, that there &s;hould be an entire uniformity of &s;entiment. But I con&s;ider one thing only as nece&s;|&s;ary for chri&s;tian charity; and that is a pure and upright heart. When the <HI>&s;erious</HI> and <HI>regular</HI> con|duct of a man, and his attachment to <HI>divine in&s;titu|tions,</HI> evinces his conformity and obedience to God, we ought to grant him the &s;ame liberty which we are willing to take to our&s;elves, of enjoying unmole&s;ted his own opinions. <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>liberality</HI> are mo&s;t amiable virtues; but <HI>modern liberality</HI> has degene|rated into licentiou&s;ne&s;s. Many call them&s;elves lib|eral, becau&s;e they di&s;regard all religion them&s;elves, and wi&s;h to have others do the &s;ame. Such per&s;ons are generally the mo&s;t &s;evere on the characters of others; e&s;pecially, of tho&s;e, who differ from them in their views of religion. A har&s;her word than
<PB N="17" REF="037789_0015_100F51572D58A480">
<HI>liberal,</HI> would better de&s;cribe their temper and con|duct. <HI>True liberality</HI> &s;prings from a <HI>generous</HI> and <HI>benevolent</HI> &s;oul; and con&s;i&s;ts in treating every <HI>hone&s;t</HI> and <HI>upright</HI> man, with a &s;uitable degree of tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect. We ought never to condemn a man, <HI>merely</HI> for his particular &s;entiments, unle&s;s they are accompanied with a manife&s;t contempt of religion, or a vicious life: But, when this is the ca&s;e, when men advocate licentious <HI>principles</HI> to countenance licentious <HI>practices,</HI> it is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with charity and liberality to con&s;ider and treat them as enemies, both to the private and public happine&s;s of mankind. But where an upright <HI>conduct</HI> evinces an upright <HI>heart,</HI> charity and tenderne&s;s towards &s;uch a character &s;hould be ever kept alive in our brea&s;ts: And when a church or &s;ociety is compo&s;ed of &s;uch characters, though they may not be perfectly uniform in &s;entiment, yet, mere difference in opinion is no rea&s;onable bar again&s;t <HI>union</HI> and <HI>fellow&s;hip.</HI> Again,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. We may here ob&s;erve and admire the wi&s;|dom and excellence of the chri&s;tian in&s;titution, in not appointing its pro&s;elytes the ob&s;ervance of any particular <HI>place</HI> or <HI>mode</HI> of wor&s;hip. The Jews were commanded to wor&s;hip the Father at Jeru&s;alem. But the time has long &s;ince come, when an end was to be put to all di&s;tinction of place. "The Jewi&s;h ceremonial law, being appropriated to the u&s;e of one people, a&s;&s;embled in one place, tending only to the purpo&s;e of a temporary &s;eparation, had, in the&s;e re|&s;pects, its relative propriety and excellence. On the contrary, the chri&s;tian religion, being de&s;igned for the &s;ervice of all mankind, of every age and nation, hath, with equal wi&s;dom, left the particular places and modes of wor&s;hip to the con&s;ent, and various circum&s;tances of different times and people." So that divine wor&s;hip, performed in different <HI>places</HI> and
<PB N="18" REF="037789_0016_100F5136F4406F30">
under different <HI>forms,</HI> may be equally acceptable to God; if he be wor&s;hipped by them <HI>in &s;pirit and in truth.</HI> Again,</P>
<P N="3">3dly and la&s;tly: We may ob&s;erve, that the &s;ub|ject we have been con&s;idering is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the de&s;ign of this day's &s;olemnity. We have a&s;&s;embled at this time to &s;eparate this hou&s;e from common u&s;es, by a &s;olemn public act, and to con&s;e|crate it to the public wor&s;hip of ALMIGHTY GOD. Although one place in it&s;elf con&s;idered, is no more acceptable to God than another; and he regards the di&s;po&s;ition of the wor&s;hippers more than any, and every thing el&s;e; yet we may pre&s;ume that dedicat|ing places de&s;igned for public wor&s;hip is an accept|able &s;ervice unto him. It manife&s;ts our reverence for God and his in&s;titutions; and may procure ble&s;|&s;ings which would not otherwi&s;e be conferred. For though God dwelleth not in temples made with hands; though his immen&s;ity cannot be confined within con&s;ecrated walls, but is every where pre&s;ent to tho&s;e who wor&s;hip him <HI>in &s;pirit and in truth;</HI> yet, the holy &s;pirit has thought fit to a&s;cribe to places, con&s;ecrated to his &s;olemn wor&s;hip, the honor of his peculiar <HI>re&s;idence.</HI> Thus he is &s;aid to have <HI>dwelt</HI> be|tween the cherubim of the mercy feat. The temple is called his <HI>hou&s;e,</HI> his <HI>court,</HI> the <HI>habitation</HI> of his ho|line&s;s, the place where his honor <HI>dwelt.</HI> And we find a re&s;pect, &s;uitable to the&s;e high characters, paid towards the temple at Jeru&s;alem, by the greate&s;t ex|amples of piety, and enjoined as a religious duty.</P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, the Author of our holy reli|gion, far from di&s;couraging &s;uch reverence, mani|fe&s;ted his concern for it, by an act of zeal the mo&s;t extraordinary of any that appeared in his whole life. In the reproof of crimes in general he was meek and lowly. Even the bla&s;phemies and indignities offer|ed
<PB N="19" REF="037789_0017_100F5158B71AB850">
to his own &s;acred character, he bore without re|&s;entment or complaint. But when he &s;aw the hou&s;e of prayer, his Father's hou&s;e, profaned, his re&s;ent|ment enkindled and broke out into a "holy tran&s;|port of indignation" again&s;t the offenders. With a &s;courge of &s;mall cords, he drove them in ha&s;te from the temple, unwilling to &s;ee a hou&s;e, dedicated to the &s;ervice of God, polluted by the iniquities of the peo|ple. And to chri&s;tian temples we ought to manife&s;t a &s;uitable degree of reverence. We cannot &s;urely ima|gine that <HI>irreverence</HI> &s;hewn to the wor&s;hip Chri&s;t him&s;elf has in&s;tituted &s;hould be without offence to him, who was &s;o highly provoked with <HI>that,</HI> &s;hewn to the wor&s;hip of the former di&s;pen&s;ation. Places &s;et apart for religious offices, &s;hew that the <HI>honor</HI> of religion is thereby intended. They are calculated to give men an awful &s;en&s;e of the duties they are to perform, and to put them in mind, that, as tho&s;e places are &s;eparated from common u&s;es and dedicat|ed to God, they &s;hould al&s;o, with becoming &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s, dedicate them&s;elves to his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides: We may hope for peculiar ble&s;&s;ings to follow in con&s;equence of this &s;acred act. When Solomon dedicated the temple of Jeru&s;alem, <HI>the glory of the Lord filled the hou&s;e of the Lord.</HI> And may we not hope that in con&s;equence of the &s;ame &s;olemn act, God may hereafter fill this hou&s;e with the glory of his <HI>power</HI> and <HI>grace?</HI></P>
<P>As wor&s;hipping God is a duty enjoined by <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> and enforced by <HI>divine revelation,</HI> may it be &s;trictly attended to, by all who are in connexion with this &s;ociety; and may they all remember, when they approach him in the duties of his &s;anctuary, <HI>to wor|&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth; for the Father &s;eeketh &s;uch to wor&s;hip him.</HI> For this &s;olemn duty may they always be prepared, by impre&s;&s;ing on their minds,
<PB N="20" REF="037789_0018_100F5138835E6570">
the mo&s;t re&s;pectful ideas of that infinite Being, who is the object of their addre&s;&s;es. And during their attendance on his &s;ervice, may they retain an awful &s;en&s;e of his maje&s;ty and pre&s;ence. As often as they here a&s;&s;emble to pre&s;ent them&s;elves before the Mo&s;t High God, may they leave, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the world and its concernments behind them, and, on the wings of holy contemplation, elevate their hearts to Heaven. And when they return from the duties of this place, now &s;acred to religion, may they retain the religious impre&s;&s;ions they may here receive.&mdash;May they not think them&s;elves retired from God; but may they hold a &s;acred intercour&s;e with him, by an attention to him in their whole conduct; by acknowledging him in all their ways; by con&s;ider|ing his will as their guide, his providence the object of their dependence, his favor the aim of their am|bition; and by rendering him continual homage in the uniform <HI>obedience</HI> of a good life. To this <HI>obedi|ence</HI> and the happine&s;s con&s;equent upon it, may this hou&s;e of prayer, now dedicated to God, prove hap|pily &s;ub&s;ervient. May it be a mean, under divine providence, of uniting many in the wor&s;hip of God, and of recommending and promoting rational piety. May the in&s;tructions, which may here be delivered, be a mean of reclaiming &s;inners; of confirming the righteous; of elucidating the doctrines and enforcing the duties of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem; and, of exhibit|ing religion in its native beauty and excellence, which, when free from &s;uper&s;tition and enthu&s;ia&s;m, appears po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every moral excellence; the ob|ject of e&s;teem and veneration.</P>
<P><HI>To Conclude:</HI>&mdash;May that &s;upreme, all propitious Being, to who&s;e &s;ervice we now dedicate this temple, and without who&s;e favor and ble&s;&s;ing <HI>their labor is but lo&s;t that built it;</HI> may he vouch&s;afe to favor the
<PB N="21" REF="037789_0019_100F515C99EB8368">
hopes of its founders; to pro&s;per this work of their hands upon them, by &s;hedding down his ble&s;&s;ings, and by imparting to every wor&s;hipper within the&s;e walls the effectual influences of his grace. May the &s;eed of true religion, here &s;own, &s;pring up, and, wa|tered with the dew of heaven, be abundantly produc|tive of the fruits of the &s;pirit, of love, peace, gentle|ne&s;s and every Chri&s;tian grace. May the beauty of holine&s;s appear in the conduct of all who may wor|&s;hip in this place. May they here be directed and find the way that leads to everla&s;ting life. And may this which is now &s;et apart as <HI>the hou&s;e of God</HI> be to tho&s;e who wor&s;hip in it, <HI>the gate of heaven;</HI> that all who wor&s;hip in this temple made with hands, may be admitted hereafter to that holy temple above, where God unveils his peculiar glory; there to unite with angels and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, in celebrating the prai&s;es of God and the Lamb, forev|er and ever.</P>
