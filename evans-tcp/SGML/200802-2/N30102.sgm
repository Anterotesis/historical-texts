<P>AS the Univer&s;al Good of Mankind is, or, at lea&s;t, ought to be, as well the particular End of every private Member of that large Community, as the more general Aim and Ambition of all publick Societies; it con|&s;equently follows. That all Actions, De|&s;igns, and Inventions, tending mediately, or immediately to the promoting that great and glorious De&s;ign, mu&s;t, in them&s;elves, be e&s;&s;entially good, and therefore Prai&s;e|worthy; and to be encourag'd and &s;upported by all tho&s;e who, partaking of that Nature, are in a Capacity to re|ceive the Benefit and Advantage of &s;uch Undertakings: And if &s;o, as there is no Ble&s;&s;ing in the Trea&s;ure of Provi|dence of &s;o true and ine&s;timable a Value as HEALTH, which (as a good Ground in a Con&s;ort of Mu&s;ick, mo|dulates and forms the Variety of Sounds, into a mo&s;t agre|able and delightful Harmony) is the very Ba&s;is and Foundation of all other &s;ubordinate Plea&s;ures, Delights and Satisfactions, &s;o, on Cour&s;e, the promoting, pre&s;er|ving, or, if lo&s;t, re&s;toring &s;o precious a Jewel, mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be one of the principal and mo&s;t acceptable De&s;igns in the Latitude of humane Application; and, as &s;uch, worthy the Encouragement and Approbation of every one, who is de&s;irous of advancing the Good of his Coun|try, without this Con&s;ideration, (which, neverthele&s;s, may be an accidental, additional Motive) That him&s;elf may, at one time or other probably &s;tand in need of &s;o great and u&s;eful a Benefit.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I Of the GOUT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a Di&s;temper of that inveterate and malignant Nature, as to be a continual Foil and Reproach to the be&s;t Phy&s;icians of all Ages: No Method of Phy&s;ic, Diet or Habit, however regular, rea&s;onable and orderly; no Pre&s;criptions, tho' bearing the &s;pecious and plau&s;ible Sanction of Academic, Graduate, and Collegate Learning, being able to give a Turn to this Di&s;temper, or reach its &s;ecret Rece&s;&s;es; for retiring into the Extremit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the fine Capillary Ve&s;&s;els, where by rea&s;on of the unequal Celerity and languid Motion of the Blood in tho&s;e Parts, it's venemous Particles are &s;uffer'd to attract one another with great Violence. It bids Defiance to all their Art, and will oftner yield to one lucky No&s;trum, than all the repeated A&s;&s;aults of what they call Regular Practi&s;e, which is never more ineffectual and at a Lo&s;s, than in this Ca&s;e; and more e&s;pecially, if that No&s;trum be prepared as the&s;e DROPS are, for &s;uch a Species of Simples as are capable of be|ing render'd, by &s;uch Preparation, fit to pierce the very inmo&s;t nervous Cells, increa&s;e the Impetus of the Vital and Animal Fluids, and follow the Particles of the morbific Matter thro' all the fine Meanders of the Blood till having di&s;turb'd their Attraction, and broke them by repeated Colli&s;ions, one again&s;t on other, into the minute&s;t Parts, it forces mo&s;t of them thro' the Pores of the Body by Per&s;piration, obtunding, ab&s;orbing, and and carrying the re&s;t away with it in its Cour&s;e, til ar|riving at the Kidneys, they are &s;ecreted there from the Blood, and pa&s;s away by Urine. All which Operations The&s;e DROPS to a Miracle perform, by Virtue of their Diaphoretic, Ab&s;orbent, and Detergent Qualities; ope|ning at once all the Emunctories of the Body, and forc|ing off, through them, they very Root an Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s of the Di&s;temper they are to cure; and that this is the only
<PB N="6" REF="039981_0007_1015CA3463991920">
effectual, rational Method of treating this ob&s;tinate Di|&s;temper the Gout, I appeal to that great Searcher of Nature, Dr. Sydenham, who &s;ays, What&s;oever is a&s;&s;i|&s;tant in di&s;charging the foul, vicious Humours, out of the Body, can never fail of an&s;wering the Intention of Cure for which it is de&s;ign'd, whethe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the Gout, Rheumati&s;m, or any other Cronick Di&s;temper. And his Authority, I &s;hould think, ought not rea&s;onably to be di&s;puted in the Cure of this Di&s;temper, whom not only a va&s;t Stock of acquir'd Learning, together with a pro|digious natural Capacity, improv'd by long and great Practice, and Experience upon Others; but al&s;o a con|tinued and unconquerable Gouty Habit in his own Body, confirm'd in this Opinion, That there was no other Method of treating this terrible Di&s;temper; which is al&s;o confirm'd by what tho&s;e two admiral Phy&s;icians, Dr. Keile, and Dr. Quincey, have told us concerning the Cau&s;e of it; which, &s;ay they, is created by the muci|laginous Glands in the Joints becoming gritty and &s;tiff, by Means of a &s;harp acid Humour flowing thereon, which coagulating the oily Liquor &s;ecreted by them for lubricating the Ends of the Bones at their &s;everal Arti|culations, to render them apt and ready for Motion, makes it, in&s;tead of promoting and a&s;&s;i&s;ting that Motion, impeed and prevent it, by clogging the Inter&s;tices, &s;o that they cannot move at all, at lea&s;t, not without very great Pain, hard'ning, by Degrees, into white, chalky, gritty Stones, which are forced to be cut, or otherwi&s;e taken out by Art, from the Joints of the Hands and Feet of the mi&s;erable Patient, as daily Experience ma|nife&s;ts.</P>
<P>Now you are to ob&s;erve, That the Particles which compo&s;e this &s;harp acid Humour, are &s;urrounded with little pointed Needles, which wound and irritate the Ve&s;&s;els thro' which they move, and the very Globules of the Blood it &s;elf, beating and coagulating thereby any Fluid with which they mix; but the&s;e being either obtunded and blunted, and the points of them, as it were, &s;heath'd and wrap'd up in &s;ome of the Particles of this Medicene, or el&s;e drove violently again&s;t one another
<PB N="7" REF="039981_0008_1015CA625B94DA20">
with a Force &s;ufficiently to break off tho&s;e little pointed Spears, and render them capable of flying off by Per&s;pira|tion by others; or el&s;e &s;o di&s;turb'd and &s;eparated by this new Auxiliary Force, that they cannot attract one an|other, but unwillingly di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves in the Blood, and are many of them &s;ecreted and carried off by Urine; This I &s;ay, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily an&s;wer the Intention of Cure; for by this Means they are rendr'd incapable of irritating, loading, or coagulating any of the Fluids; and then, on Cour&s;e, the Di&s;temper before caus'd by them, mu&s;t by Degrees abate, and at length ab&s;olutely cea&s;e. To which Ends and Purpo&s;es. The&s;e DROPS are &s;o excellently a|dapted and prepar'd, and are in their Nature &s;o very Ab|&s;orbent, Detergent and Diaphoretic, that it is morally impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould fail of working a Cure, which can only be perform'd by the joint Operation of tho&s;e three Qualities, which are &s;carce to be met with, in any con&s;iderable Degree, in any one Medicine in the World, but THIS alone.</P>
<P>But perhaps, &s;ome who under&s;tand no nore of this Di&s;|temper than the Pain and Torture it gives them, will &s;ay, That probably in the former Stage of this Di&s;temper, the&s;e Drops may be effectual; but, &s;ay they, mine is in|my Stomach, Bowels, &amp;c. and they will not be able to reach it there. But how weak and trivial an Objection this is, will appear from a Reflection upon this Pha&s;e of the Gout, which is only caus'd by a Weakne&s;s and debili|ty of Nature, thro' frequent Debauches, hard Drinking, long Cour&s;es of u&s;ele&s;s Phy&s;ic, &amp;c. whereby the Impetus of the Blood becomes &s;o weak and languid, and its Motion &s;o &s;low and irregular, as to permit the morbific Particles to attract one another in the Blood Ve&s;&s;els of tho&s;e Parts, which can only be remedied by &s;uch Things as warm and increa&s;e the Blood's inte&s;tine Motion, &s;o breaking and di&s;|turbing the Attraction of the venemous Particles, and &s;ending them back again to the extream Parts, where they are to be treated as before: For which Purpo&s;e, nothing in Nature can be better fitted than the&s;e Drops, which have &s;uch a fine invigorating, Alexiterial Property in them
<PB N="8" REF="039981_0009_1015CA37AFDB9A28">
as to render them one of the be&s;t Cardiacs in the whole Materia Medica.</P>
<P>THE Do&s;e in the former Pha&s;e of the De&s;temper, is a large Spoonful, in any warm Vehicle, as Moun|tain Wine, &s;trong Ale: &amp;c. made as hot as you can drink it, repeated three Nights &s;uc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ively, going to Bed, and, by the Bl&s;&s;ing of GOD, you need not fear Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>But in the latter Pha&s;e, where the morbific Matter is not only to be repelled, but the faint and languid State of Nature enliven'd and invigorated, it is nece&s;sary that you increace your Do&s;e as the Cau&s;e may require, in any warm Vehicle, as before; compo&s;ing your &s;elf after it, and encouraging Sweat by all proper Methods.</P>
<P>After this in order effectually to rout this mo&s;t terible Enemy it is nece&s;&s;ary you continiue to take a &s;mall Do&s;e of about 100, or 150 Drops, every Three Nights alter|nately; taking three Nights, and mi&s;&s;ing three Nights; till &s;uch time as you find the Strength of the Di&s;temper to abate, which it will &s;en&s;ibly do in a &s;mall time, and at length quite go off.</P>
<P>In&s;tances of the Cure of this Di&s;temper, by The&s;e DROPS, might be given in great Numbers, from Per&s;ons of undoubted Credit, and Reputation, on enquiry, would &s;ati&s;fy the Curious of their wonderful Effect in that Intention: but not bring willing to tire the Reader; and the&s;e Drops, by their continual Succe&s;s, &s;o &s;trongly recomending them&s;elves? I &s;hall out of a very great multitude only trouble you with a few, as you will find at the end of this Treati&s;e.</P>

<P>TO give you an exact Theory of this Di&s;temper, would take up more room than this &s;hort Treati&s;e will admit of: I &s;hall therefore, as I have done by the other Di&s;tempers, in the foregoing Chapters, open it &s;o far to you, as to convince you, that the&s;e DROPS are the be&s;t Specifick (if I may be indulg'd that Term) in the whole Materia Medica, to break thro' it's Schirrous Ob&s;tructions, and finally eradicate it and all its dreadful Symptoms out of the humane Body.</P>

This Di&s;temper ari&s;es from ob&s;tructions in the Glands of the Liver, thereby preventing a due Secretion of the Gall from the Blood, by them in that Vi&s;cus, which Bilious Particles circulating therewith, gives a Yellow Tincture to the Mucus or Curpus Reticulare &s;pred un|der the Cuticula, which from thence appears of that Co|lour: This is the fir&s;t and common Pha&s;e of this Di|&s;temper; but it will &s;ometimes, and more e&s;pecially in hard Drinkers, arrive to that height, as to Cau&s;e a fre|quent Spitting and Vomiting of Blood, which is general|ly reckon'd a Mortal Symptom; for it is cau&s;ed by the Ob&s;tructions in the Hepatic Glands becomming &s;chirrous; and &s;o indurated, as with great Difficulty (if at all) to be opened again; which &s;traitens the Motion of the Blood through that Vi&s;cus &s;o much, as to cau&s;e it to revul&s;e with a great Motion into the Ga&s;trick Arteries, which go off from the Hepatic, in&s;omuch, that breaking through them, it drains into the Stomach, and by that means the Cour&s;e of that fluid is alter'd the Secretion of the Bile at an End, and the whole Sy&s;tem de&s;troy'd: So that this latter Stage of the Di&s;temper is &s;eldom or never to be cured; but may ea&s;ily be prevented by taking the former Pha&s;e in time; powerfully deterging tho&s;e tartarous abdura|ting Particles out of the Blood; which can only be by &s;trong Detergents and Diaphoreticks, (which I have al|ready prov'd to you the&s;e DROPS are; and therefore cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ail of Curing, if taken in time, and followed up, till by a Continuation they become perfect Altera|tives:) And if any thing will cure the latter Pha&s;e of this Di&s;temper, the&s;e DROPS will, having done Won|ders in it, even when the Patients have been given over by their Phy&s;icians, and the Di&s;temper baffled their utmo&s;t Skill.</P>

<P>THESE are one and the &s;ame Di&s;temper, in two &s;everal Degrees; the Stone being only concerted Gravel, and the Gravel the Matter whereof the Stone is form'd and in &s;ome what is wa&s;h'd off it by po|werful Nepritic and Lytholutics; both of them being in their Degree an aggregate of the tartarous Particles of the Urine, pent up by the Straitne&s;s of the Urinary Ducts; which is only to be cur'd by di&s;&s;olving the Stone, widening and deterging the Pa&s;&s;ages; and ridding the Blood of tho&s;e tartarous Particles by Diaphoretics, before the Secretion of Urine is perform'd: All which &s;everal Operations the&s;e DROPS perform to a Wonder, and have, by their Detergent Diuretick Quality, brought away, from &s;everal Per&s;ons, STONES of the Size of a &s;mall Nut Kernel, when every other Remedy has fail'd to give them Ea&s;e; and, by being continued afterwards, cleans'd the Blood of it's tartarous Particles, &s;o as to prevent another Fit for many years.</P>

Hints concerning their Cau&s;e and Sy&s;tems, and then pro|ceeding to the Di&s;cription of the Eeffects of the&s;e Drops in all tho&s;e Intentions.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t, it is nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e what an A&s;thma is in general: That it is a frequent, difficult, and &s;hort Re&s;pira|tion, or Breathing, join'd with a hi&s;&s;ing Sound, and a Cough; e&s;pecially in the Night, in cold Weather, and in a prone Po&s;ture, or lying down: The former becau&s;e the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Atmo&s;phere is greater in the Night then in the Day, when the Noxious Vapours exhal'd and di&s;pel'd by the Force of the Sun Beams. In the Night, by rea&s;on of the Pores of the Body being contracted by the circum|ambient Cold, our Tpan&s;piration is le&s;&s;en'd, and con&s;e|quently a Gravedo or Weight of per&s;pirable Matter en&s;ues; which being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lung upon the lungs, clogs them, and renders them le&s;s apt to perform their Office; and in the la&s;t Ca&s;e, from the Pre&s;&s;ure which the contents of the Abdomen, when the Body is in that Po&s;ture, make upon the Diaphragm, thereby le&s;&s;ening the Capacity of the Thorax or Brea&s;t, &s;o that the Lungs are too much confin'd, and cannot dilate them&s;elves &s;ufficient to receive a due Quantity of Air.</P>
<P>This being premis'd, it will be ea&s;ily under&s;tood, how the&s;e &s;everal Kinds of A&s;thmas are produced: The fir&s;t or Humid, call'd al&s;o the Peluretic A&s;thma, ari&s;es from the Redundance of Rheumatic Serum, and vi&s;cous Humours in the Blood, which being too thick to pa&s;s through the &s;mall Fibres of the Lungs &s;tick clo&s;e to the Sides of tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, and ob&s;truct the Blood in its Circulation; the Parts &s;well and often ulcerate, with great Pain, feveri&s;h Habbits, and Difficulty of breathing: Or el&s;e the pitui|tous Particles are &s;pewed out into the Bronchiae, e&s;pecially if not impregnated with a due Proportion of Salts, cau&s;ing a continual irritating Cough: In both which Ca&s;es all inciding Pectorals are good, all Diaphoretits, and what|ever attenuates and le&s;&s;ens the Quantity of Serum; by that means depleting the extended Ve&s;&s;els, and Working a Revul&s;ion of the &s;tagnating Humours: Which nothing can better effect then the&s;e DROPS, which evacuate both by Per&s;piration and Urine, and are certainly, at the

<P>The next Species of this Di&s;temper, is the dry or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|thoric A&s;thma, caus'd either by too great a Repletion of a cachochymious Blood call'd a Plethora, or el&s;e by too great a Rarefaction of that Fluid in it's Ve&s;&s;els; &s;o that the fine Canalls of the Lungs are too far di&s;tended; and con&s;equently there is not room enough for the Air to inflate the Ve&s;&s;els, which produces an Inability of Re|&s;piration, for want of a due Degree of Expan&s;ion in that Vi&s;cus: Such Per&s;ons are generally crying out for Air; they always &s;eem as if girted hard upon their Che&s;t, and are almo&s;t become Victims to a long Scorbutick Ca|chetic Habit; of which this is the la&s;t, and oftentimes, for want of proper Remedies apply'd in time, fatal Symptoms; or in this Ca&s;e there is no time to u&s;e Al|teratives, which work but &s;lowly in the Ma&s;s of Blood; whereas here we want an immediate A&s;&s;i&s;tance; which can only be obtain'd by a Conjunction of Cardiacs and Diaphoretics, both which Qualities are eminently di&s;tin|gui&s;hable in the&s;e DROPS; Which can therefore never fail the Intention of Cure in this Di&s;temper,</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI Of Colds, Agues, Fevers, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I Put the&s;e Di&s;tempers all in one Cla&s;s becau&s;e they have a mutual Relation the one to the other, as the Cau&s;e has to the Effect, &amp; e contra, and as different Effects produced from the &s;ame Cau&s;e have to another; for it may generally be allow'd that what we call Colds are the Ba&s;is, or Ground work of mo&s;t of tho&s;e Epedemic Fevers, which &s;o commonly rage in this Kingdom: For per&s;piration being dimini&s;h'd thro' a Contraction of the pores, caus'd by the perception of external Cold, the Per&s;pirable Matter flies of in a le&s;s Quantity than when the Pores are more relax'd; and that part thereof which cannot get out, returns back into the Blood, which it heats and irritates more or le&s;s according to the Quan|tity of Matter retain'd, forcing it to di&s;tend it's Ve&s;&s;els, and producing thence frequently a Solutio continui, whence follows the Idea or pain in that part, with a Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">do or Heavine&s;s of the whole Frame, but e&s;pecially of the di&s;eas'd part; or el&s;e, a Coryza or Defluxion of &s;erous, &s;harp Humours from the Glands of the Head, thro' the Eyes, No&s;e, Mouth, &amp;c. From whence, if &s;peedy C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re is not taken, are engender'd A&s;thma's, Con|&s;umptions, Fevers, &amp;c. And a whole Train of Evils which may be ea&s;ily and certainly prevented, by a timely U&s;e of &s;ome proper Evacuator, which &s;hall by it's Diaphoretic Quality, di&s;charge the Blood of it's Load of foreign deleterious Matter; and force off the offending Particles thro' the Pores; which we call Sweating: To which Purpo&s;e, there is no one Thing in Nature more effectual than the&s;e Drops, which are mo&s;t power|ful Diaphoretic, and never fail of Succe&s;s in the mo&s;t &s;tubborn Cold whatever. It is an old and indeed mo&s;t excellent Maxim,

And &s;o 'tis here, a &s;ingle Do&s;e &s;eldom or never &s;ails cur|ing a Cold, whereas if you let that Cold grow into a Fe|ver, it may be the Work of &s;everal to compleat the Cure; and glad you may be to come off &s;o; for nothing corrupts the Blood more than a Cold, by irritating, and inflaming it to the highe&s;t Degree; whence proceed Putrifactions, which if not evacuated by proper Remedies, increa&s;e the Fervour, and often generate acute, putrid, and malig|nant Fevers, who&s;e dire Effects daily Examples &s;uffici|ently demon&s;trate to every ones Experience. The&s;e dele|terious and malignant Particles are therefore to be evacu|ated both by augmenting the before dimini&s;h'd Per&s;pi|ration, and the urinary Secretion; for by that Means, a great Quantity of them pa&s;s off with the di&s;charg'd Se|rum, and on Cour&s;e le&s;&s;en the Fermentation in the Blood: But unle&s;s at the &s;ame Time, you u&s;e proper Cardiacs to refre&s;h Nature, &s;he will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nk under this va&s;t Burthen, for, the Hurry and Heat the Blood is in, nece&s;&s;arily con|&s;umes a va&s;t Quantity of the animal Spirits, which de|caying fa&s;ter than Nature can po&s;&s;ibly return them, &s;he mu&s;t certainly fall beneath the prodigious Wa&s;t, unle&s;s reliev'd by &s;ome auxiliary Force. Now, as I have of|ten mentioned before, the&s;e Drops are both Diaphoretic, Diuretic, and Cardiac; containing in them&s;elves all tho&s;e three great Qalities, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in a com|pleat Febrifuge, and them&s;elves by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God effect a perfect Cure with out the Help of any other Medi|cine.</P>
<P><HI>As for Agues, they are only the Intermi&s;&s;ions of Fevers, the cold Fit being only an accidental, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d not an e&s;&s;ential Property thereunto; &s;o that as they are properly a Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">s, of a Fever, they are to be treated after the &s;ame Manner, and the Method and Intention of Cure, is the very &s;ame; and if &s;o, then con&s;equent|ly the &s;ame Remedy that prevails again&s;t one, cannot fail in the other.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="039981_0018_1015CA6F613217B8">
<HI>And here, I cannot omit mentioning one peculiar Property in the&s;e Drops, &s;ufficient of it &s;elf to recommend them effectu|ally to all the rea&s;onable part of Mankind, who are not wedded to methodical Error; and that is, their powerful Energy in clearing the Blood from the Dregs of that fa&s;hionable (but in many Ca&s;es pernicious) Drug,</HI> the Bark of Peru, <HI>commonly called,</HI> The Je&s;uites Bark. <HI>This is the Publik A&s;ylum of Mankind, the Panacea of the World, the &s;overeign and uni|ver&s;al Orvietem again&s;t all the Di&s;ea&s;es of Pandora's Box, and what not, in the Opinion of tho&s;e valetudenarian Wretches, who dare not eat a Meals Meat, open a Chamber Window, or &s;o much as go to Stool, without the Leave of their Phy&s;ician; who&s;e con&s;tant Pre&s;cription is &s;till the Bark, in &s;ome Form or other: If Madam has got a fit of the Vapours, the Bark will chear her Spirits: If &s;he has taken too plentiful a Do&s;e of Ratifea, the Bark will make her as &s;ober as a Nun: If &s;he is Love&s;ick, the Bark is to moderate her De&s;ires: And if &s;he is in the raging Fever of Jealou&s;y, the Bark is to make her believe that her Husban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> is as Con&s;tant as a Turtle: In &s;hort, whenever the Privy-Counceller of Health is at a Lo&s;s what to do for his Guinea, he per&s;wades his Patient &s;he has an inter|mitting Fever, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d Bark is the Word to &s;ave the Expence of further thinking.

One learned Practi|tioner &s;ays, the Bark is a violent Stiptic, and A&s;tringent; ano|ther, it is &s;olutive, and will of it &s;elf, without proper Altera|tives, pa&s;s immediately downwards.

<P>But if there be any Virtue in the Drug, the Ta&s;t it &s;elf &s;eems to point it out to be Stiptic, and A&s;tringent, which is al&s;o generally allow'd by all who have any Skill in it; while for Fa&s;hion &s;ake they admit of other Qua|lities, as if it were by pre&s;criptive Right; and for In|tere&s;t invent new ones to Authorize its Admini&s;tration in &s;ome Pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ity: Now, if once it is allow'd, the Bark is Styptic and A&s;tringent, it points out directly to the Manner of its Operation and Effect; in &s;eemingly giving a turn to &s;ome certain periodical Exacerbations; for which it is more generally admini&s;tred, as intermit|ting Fevers, Hemicraneas, Haemoptoes, Epilip&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and Hy&s;terics; which, &s;ays a great and learned Author, are to be reliev'd the Cortex only; but what Way is this Relief to be had? why, &s;ays the &s;ame Author, the Cor|tex lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ks up the febrile Ferment in the Blood; and, &s;ays he, in another Place, if Cathartics be given &s;oon after it, they make the Type of the Fever return in its old Shape, for when the Bark is carried off, what looks up the Di&s;temper? From whence I conclude, that this mighty Medicine, like a cunning Mountebank, deludes us with plau&s;ible Appearances, and in&s;tead of really

From the Character and known Credit of Mr. Morley afore&s;aid, I made trial of the above mention'd Drops, and found in taking a few Bottles that &s;atisfactory Relief that many pound&s;worth of Medicines before taken, could never effect; for my Cough and Shortness of Breath &s;oon abated I took my natural Re&s;t, which I had not done for many Years, and my former Appetite and Stomach return'd to my entire Satisfactiom. This I think my &s;elf bound in Duty to Mandkind in general, publickly to de|clare, under my Hand.</P>
