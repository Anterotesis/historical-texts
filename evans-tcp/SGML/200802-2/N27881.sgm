<HEAD>THE TWO SHOEMAKERS.</HEAD>
<P>HE knew he owed his pre&s;ent happy &s;ituation to the kindne&s;s of the creditors. But did he grow ea&s;y and carele&s;s becau&s;e he knew he had &s;uch friends? No indeed. He worked with double diligence in order to get out of debt, and to let the&s;e friends &s;ee he did not abu&s;e their kindne&s;s. Such beha|viour as this is the greate&s;t encourage|ment in the world to rich people to lend a little money.</P>
<P>His &s;hoes, and boots were made in the be&s;t manner, this <HI>got</HI> him bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;et out with a rule to tell no lies and deceive no cu&s;tomers; this <HI>secured</HI> his bu&s;ine&s;s. He had two rea&s;ons for not promi&s;ing to &s;end home goods when he knew he &s;hould not be able to keep his

word. The fir&s;t, becau&s;e he knew a lie was a &s;in, the next, becau&s;e it was a folly. There is no credit &s;ooner worn out than that which is got by fal&s;e pre|tences. After a little while no one is deceived by them. Fal&s;ehood is &s;o &s;oon found out that I believe mo&s;t trade&s;men are the poorer for it in the long run. Deceit is the wor&s;t part of a &s;hopkeep|er's &s;tock in trade.</P>
<P>James was now at the head of a fami|ly. "This is a &s;erious &s;ituation," (&s;aid he to him&s;elf, one fine &s;ummer's evening, as he &s;tood leaning over the half door of his &s;hop to enjoy a little fre&s;h air) "I am now ma&s;ter of a fami|ly. My cares are doubled and &s;o are my duties. I &s;ee the higher one gets in life the more one has to an&s;wer for. Let me now call to mind the &s;orrow I u&s;ed to feel when I was made to carry work home on a Sunday by an ungodly ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>So what his heart found right to do he re&s;olved to do quickly; and he &s;et out at fir&s;t as he meant to go on. The Sunday
<PB N="5" REF="037146_0004_100C83A62B0F3950">
was truly a day of re&s;t at Mr. Stock's. He would not allow a pair of &s;hoes to be given out on that day to oblige the be&s;t cu&s;tomer he had. And what did he loo&s;e by it? Why nothing. For when people were once u&s;ed to it, they liked Saturday night ju&s;t as well. But had it been otherwi&s;e he would have given up his gains to his con&s;cience.</P>

<HEAD>Shewing how Mr. STOCK behaved to his APPRENTICES.</HEAD>
<P>When he got up in the world &s;o far as to have apprentices, he thought him|&s;elf as accountable for their behaviour as if they had been his children. He was very kind to them, and had a cheerful merry way of talking to them, &s;o that the lads who had &s;een much of &s;wearing reprobate ma&s;ters, were very fond of him. They were never afraid of &s;peaking to him, they told him all their little troubles, and con&s;idered their ma&s;ter as their be&s;t friend, for they &s;aid they would do any thing for a good word and a kind look. As he did not
<PB N="6" REF="037146_0005_100C9531AB778C58">
&s;wear at them when they had been guil|ty of a fault, they did not lie to him to conceal it, and thereby make one fault two. But though he was very kind, he was very watchful al&s;o, for he did not think neglect any part of kind|ne&s;s. He brought them to one pretty method, which was, of a Sunday even|ing to divert them&s;elves with writing out half a dozen texts of Scripture in a pretty copy book with gilt covers. You may have the &s;ame at any of the Stati|oner's; they do not co&s;t above eleven-pence, and will la&s;t nearly a year.</P>
<P>When the boys carried him their books, he ju&s;tly commended him who&s;e texts were written in the faire&s;t hand. "And now my boys," &s;aid he, "let us &s;ee which of you will learn your texts be&s;t in the cour&s;e of the week; he who does &s;hall chu&s;e for next Sunday." Thus the boys &s;oon got many p&s;alms and chapters by heart, almo&s;t without knowing how they came by them. He taught them how to make a practical u&s;e of what they learnt; "for," &s;aid he, "it
<PB N="7" REF="037146_0006_100C9533B7483CA8">
will an&s;wer little purpo&s;e to learn texts if we do not try to live up to them." One of the boys being apt to play in his ab&s;ence, and to run back again to his work when he heard his ma&s;ters &s;tep, he brought him to a &s;en&s;e of his fault by the la&s;t Sunday's texts, which happened to be the 6th of Ephe&s;ians. He &s;hewed him what was meant by being "obedi|ent to his ma&s;ter in &s;inglene&s;s of heart as unto Chri&s;t," and explained to him with &s;o much kindne&s;s what it was, "not to work with eye &s;ervice as men plea&s;ers, but doing the will of God from the heart," that the lad &s;aid he &s;hould never forget it, and it did more towards curing him of idlene&s;s than the &s;ounde&s;t hor&s;e-whipping would have done.</P>

<HEAD>How Mr. STOCK got out of debt.</HEAD>
<P>Stock's behaviour was very regular, and he was much beloved for his kind and peaceable temper. He had al&s;o a good reputation for &s;kill in his trade, and his indu&s;try was talked of through the whole town, &s;o that he had &s;oon more
<PB N="8" REF="037146_0007_100C9535E59D3238">
work than he could po&s;&s;ibly do. He paid all his dealers to the very day, and took care to carry his intere&s;t money to the creditors the moment it became due. In two or three years he was able to be|gin to pay off a &s;mall part of the princi|pal. His rea&s;on for being &s;o eager to pay money as &s;oon as it became due was this. He had ob&s;erved trade&s;men, and e&s;pecially his old ma&s;ter, put off the day of payment as long as they could, even though they had the means in their power. This deceived them. For ha|ving money in their pockets they forgot it belonged to the creditor, and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o them&s;elves, and &s;o got to fancy they were rich when they were really poor. This fal&s;e notion led them to indulge in idle expences, whereas, if they had paid regularly they would have had this one temptation the le&s;s. A young trade&s;man, when he is going to &s;pend money, &s;hould at lea&s;t a&s;k him&s;elf whe|ther this money is his own or his credit|ors. This little que&s;tion might help to prevent many a bankruptcy.</P>

A true Chri&s;tian always goes heartily to work to find out what is his be&s;etting &s;in; and when he has found it, (which he ea&s;ily may if he looks &s;harp) again&s;t this &s;in he watches narrowly. Now I know it is the fa&s;hion among &s;ome folks (and a bad fa&s;hion it is) to fancy that good people have no &s;in; but this only &s;hews their ignorance. It is not true. That good man St. Paul knew better. And when men do not own their &s;ins, it is not becau&s;e there is no &s;in in their hearts, but becau&s;e they are not anxious to &s;earch for it, nor humble to confe&s;s it, nor penitent to mourn over it. But this was not the ca&s;e with James Stock. "Examine your&s;elves truly," &s;aid he, "is no bad part of the catechi&s;m." He began to be afraid that his de&s;ire of living creditably and without being a burthen to any one, might, under the ma&s;k of hone&s;ty and independence lead him into pride and covetou&s;ne&s;s. He feared that the bias of his heart lay that way. So in&s;tead of being proud of his &s;obriety; in&s;tead of bragging that he never &s;pent his money idly, nor went
<PB N="10" REF="037146_0009_100C839D0AD80428">
to the alehou&s;e&punc; in&s;tead of boa&s;ting how hard he worked, and how he denied him&s;elf, he &s;trove in &s;ecret that even the&s;e good qualities might not grow out of a wrong root. The following event was of u&s;e to him in this way.</P>
<P>One evening as he was &s;tanding at the door of his &s;hop, a poor dirty boy without-&s;tockings and &s;hoes came up and a&s;ked him for a bit of broken victuals, for he had eaten nothing all day. In &s;pite of his dirt and rags he was a very pretty, lively, civil &s;poken boy, and Mr. Stock could not help thinking he knew &s;omething of his face. He fetched him out a good piece of bread and chee&s;e, and while the boy was devouring it, a&s;k|ed him if he had no parents, and why he went about in that vagabond manner? "Daddy has been dead &s;ome years," &s;aid the boy, "he died in a fit over at the Greyhound. Mammy &s;ays he u&s;ed to live at this &s;hop, and then we did not want for clothes nor victuals neither." Stock was melted almo&s;t tears on finding that this dirty beggar boy was Tommy

Williams, the &s;on of his old ma&s;ter. He ble&s;&s;ed God on comparing his own hap|py condition with that of this poor de&s;|titute child, but he was not proud at the compari&s;on, and while he was thank|ful for his own pro&s;perity, he pitied the helple&s;s boy.&mdash;"Where have you been living of late," &s;aid he to him? "for I under&s;tand you all went home to your mother's friends." "So we did Sir," &s;aid the boy, "but they are grown tired of maintaining us, becau&s;e they &s;aid that Mammy &s;pent all the money which &s;hould have gone to buy victuals for us, on &s;nuff and drams. And &s;o they have &s;ent us back to this place, which is Daddy's pari&s;h."</P>
<P>"And where do you live here?" &s;aid Mr. Stock. "O Sir, we are all put in the pari&s;h poor-hou&s;e."&mdash;"And does your mother do any thing to help to maintain you?" "No, Sir, for Mammy &s;ays &s;he was not brought up to work like poor folks, and &s;he would rather &s;tarve than &s;pin or knit; &s;o &s;he lies a bed all the morning, and &s;ends us about to pick
<PB N="12" REF="037146_0011_100C953D0A514028">
up what we can, a bit of victuals, or a few half-pence." "And have you any money in your pocket now?" "Yes, Sir, I have got three half-pence which I have begged to day." "Then, as you were &s;o very hungry, how came you not to buy a roll at that baker's over the way?" "Becau&s;e, Sir, I was going to lay it out in tea for Mammy, for I nev|er lay out a farthing for my&s;elf. In|deed Mammy &s;ays &s;he will have her tea twice a day if we beg or &s;tarve for it." "Can you read my boy?" &s;aid Mr. Stock. "A little, Sir, and &s;ay my pray|ers too." "And can you &s;ay your catechi&s;m?" "I have almo&s;t forgot it all, Sir, though I remember about ho|nouring my father and mother, and that makes me &s;till carry the half-pence home to Mammy in&s;tead of buying cakes." "Who taught you the&s;e good things?" "One Jemmy Stock, Sir, who was par|i&s;h 'prentice to my Daddy. He taught me one que&s;tion out of the catechi&s;m every night, and always made me &s;ay my prayers to him before I went to bed. He told me I &s;hould go to the wicked

place if I did not fear God, &s;o I am &s;till afraid to tell lies like the other boys. Poor Jemmy gave me a piece of gin|gerbread every time I learnt well; but I have no friend now&punc; Jemmy was good to me, though Mammy did nothing but beat him."</P>
<P>Mr. Stock was too much moved to carry on the di&s;cour&s;e, he did not make him&s;elf, known to the boy, but took him over to the baker's &s;hop; as they walked along he could not help repeating aloud, a ver&s;e or two of that beautiful hymn, &s;o de&s;ervedly the favourite of all chil|dren,</P>
<Q><L>Not more th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n others I de&s;erve,</L>
<L>Yet God hath given me more;</L>
<L>For I have food while others &s;tarve,</L>
<L>Or beg from door to door.</L></Q>
<P>The little boy looked up in his face &s;aying, "Why Sir, that's the very hymn which Jemmy Stock gave me a penny for learning." Stock made no an&s;wer,
<PB N="14" REF="037146_0013_100C95414C2EA318">
but put a couple of three penny loaves into his hand to carry home, and told him to call on him again at &s;uch a time in the following week.</P>

<HEAD>How Mr. STOCK continued to be charit|able without any Expence.</HEAD>
<P>Stock had abundant &s;ubject for medi|tation that night. He was puzzled what to do with the boy. While he was carrying on his trade upon borrow|ed money he did not think it right to give any part of that money to a&s;&s;i&s;t the idle, or even to help the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. "I mu&s;t be ju&s;t," &s;aid he, "before I am generous." Still he could not bear to &s;ee this fine boy given up to certain ruin. He did not think it &s;afe to take him into the &s;hop in his pre&s;ent ignorant unprincipled &s;tate. At la&s;t he hit upon this thought. I work for my&s;elf twelve hours in the day. Why &s;hall not I work one hour or two for this boy in the evening? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> will be but for a year, and I &s;hall then have more right to do what I plea&s;e. My money will then be my own, I &s;hall have paid my debts.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="037146_0014_100C9543CF0C6AC0">
So he began to put his re&s;olution in practice that very night, &s;ticking to his old notion of not putting off till to-mor-row what &s;hould be done to-day; and it was thought he owed much of his &s;uc|ce&s;s in life, as well as his growth in goodne&s;s to this little &s;aying. "I am young and healthy," &s;aid he, "one hour's more work will do me no harm; I will &s;et a&s;ide all I get by the&s;e over hours, and put the boy to &s;chool. I have not only no right to puni&s;h this child for the &s;ins of his father, but I con&s;ider that though God hated tho&s;e &s;ins, he has made them in&s;truments for my ad|vancement."</P>
<P>Tommy Williams called at the time appointed. In the mean time Mr. Stock's maid had made him a tidy little &s;uit of clothes out of an old coat of her ma&s;ter's. She had al&s;o knit him a pair of &s;tockings, and Mr. Stock made him &s;it down in the &s;hop, while he him&s;elf fitted him with a pair of new &s;hoes. The maid having wa&s;hed and dre&s;&s;ed him, Mr. Stock took him by the hand
<PB N="16" REF="037146_0015_100C954668B806C8">
and walked along with him to the pari&s;h poor-hou&s;e to find his mother. They found her dre&s;&s;ed in ragged filthy finery, &s;tanding at the door, where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of her time, quarrelling with half a dozen women as idle and dirty as her|&s;elf; when &s;he &s;aw Tommy &s;o neat and well dre&s;&s;ed, &s;he fell a crying for joy. She &s;aid it put her mind of old times, for Tommy always u&s;ed to be dre&s;&s;ed like a gentleman. "So much the wor&s;e," &s;aid Mr. Stock, "if you had not begun by making him look like a gentleman, you needed not have ended by making him look like a beggar." "Oh Jem," &s;aid &s;he, (for though it was four years &s;ince &s;he had &s;een him, &s;he &s;oon recollected him) "fine times for you! &s;et a beggar on hor&s;eback&mdash;you know the proverb. I &s;hall beat Tommy well for finding you out, and expo&s;ing me to you."</P>
<P>In&s;tead of entering into any di&s;pute with this bad wowan, or prai&s;ing him|&s;elf at her expence; or putting her in mind of her pa&s;t ill behaviour to him; or reproaching her with the bad u&s;e &s;he
<PB N="17" REF="037146_0016_100C95485C7E7AB8">
had made of her pro&s;perity, he mildly &s;aid to her, "Mrs. Williams I am &s;orry for your misfortunes; I am come to relieve you of part of your burthen. I will take Tommy off your hands. I will give him a years board and &s;chooling, and by that time I &s;hall &s;ee what he is fit for. I will promi&s;e nothing, but if the boy turns out well I will never for|&s;ake him. I &s;hall make but one bargain with you, which is, that he mu&s;t not come to this place to hear all this rail|ing and &s;wearing, nor &s;hall he keep company with the&s;e pilfering idle chil|dren. You are welcome to go and &s;ee him when you plea&s;e, but here he mu&s;t not come.</P>
<P>The fooli&s;h woman bur&s;t out a crying, &s;aying, "&s;he &s;hould lo&s;e her poor dear Tommy for ever. Mr. Stock might give <HI>her</HI> the money he intended to pay at the &s;chool, for nobody could do &s;o well by him as his own mother." The truth was, &s;he wanted to get the&s;e new clothes into her clutches, which would all have been pawned at the dram &s;hop before
<PB N="18" REF="037146_0017_100C954A31C7E580">
the week was out. This Mr. Stock well knew. From crying &s;he fell to &s;colding and &s;wearing. She told him he was an unnatural wretch, that want|ed to make a child de&s;pi&s;e his own mo|ther becau&s;e &s;he was poor. She even went &s;o far as to &s;ay &s;he would not part from him; &s;he &s;aid &s;he hated your godly people, they had no bowels of compa&s;|&s;ion, but tried to &s;et men, women, and children again&s;t their own fle&s;h and blood.</P>
<P>Mr. Stock now almo&s;t lo&s;t his patience, and for one moment a thought came a|cro&s;s him to &s;trip the boy, carry back his clothes, and leave him to his unpit|iful mother. "Why," &s;aid he, "&s;hould I work over hours, and wear out my &s;trength for this wicked woman?" But he &s;oon checked this thought, by reflect|ing on the patience and long &s;uffering of God with rebellious &s;inners. This cur|ed his anger in a moment, and he mildly rea&s;oned with her on her folly and blind|ne&s;s in oppo&s;ing the good of her child.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="037146_0018_100C954CAD5BA9F0">
One of the neighbours who &s;tood by, &s;aid, what a fine thing it was for the boy, but &s;ome people were born to be lucky! She wi&s;hed Mr. Stock would take a fancy to her child, he &s;hould have him &s;oon enough. Mrs. Williams now began to be frightened le&s;t Mr. Stock &s;hould take the woman at her word, and &s;ullenly con&s;ented to let the boy go, from envy and malice, not from prudence and gratitude; and Tommy was &s;ent to &s;chool that very night, his mother crying and roaring in&s;tead of thanking God for &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>And here I cannot forbear telling a very goodnatured thing of Will Simp|&s;on, one of the workmen. By-the-by it was that very young fellow who was reformed by Stock's good example when he was an apprentice, and who u&s;ed to &s;ing P&s;alms with him on a Sunday even|ing when they got out of the way of Wil|liams's junketting. Will coming home early one evening, was &s;urpri&s;ed to find his ma&s;ter at work by him&s;elf, long af|ter the u&s;ual time. He begged &s;o hear|tily
<PB N="20" REF="037146_0019_100C954EA1C08890">
to know the rea&s;on, that Stock owned the truth. Will was &s;o &s;truck with this piece of kindne&s;s, that he &s;natched up a la&s;t, crying out, "Well ma&s;ter, you &s;hall not work by your&s;elf however; we will go &s;nacks in main|taining Tommy; it &s;hall never be &s;aid that Will Simp&s;on was idling about, when his ma&s;ter was working for char|ity." This made the hour pa&s;s cheer|fully and doubled the profits.</P>
<P>In a year or two Mr. Stock, by God's ble&s;&s;ing on his labours, became quite clear of the world. He now paid off his creditors; but he never forgot his obligation to them, and found many op|portunities of &s;hewing kindne&s;s to them, and to their children after them. He now ca&s;t about for a proper wife, and as he was thought a pro&s;perous man, and very well looking be&s;ides, mo&s;t of the &s;mart girls of the place, with their tawdry finery, u&s;ed to be often parading before the &s;hop, and would even go to church in order to put them&s;elves in his way. But Mr. Stock when he went to
<PB N="21" REF="037146_0020_100C9550955CAC78">
church had other things in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ead, and if ever he thought about the&s;e gay dam&s;els at all, it was with concern at &s;eeing them &s;o improperly tricked out, &s;o that the very means they took to plea&s;e him, made him di&s;like them.</P>
<P>There was one Betty We&s;t, a young woman of excellent character and very mode&s;t appearance. He had &s;eldom &s;een her out, as &s;he was employed night and day in waiting on an aged widow|ed mother who was both lame and blind. This good girl was indeed eyes and feet to her helple&s;s parent, and Mr. Stock u&s;ed to &s;ee her through the little ca&s;ement window lifting her up and feeding her with a tenderne&s;s which greatly rai&s;ed his e&s;teem for her. He u&s;ed to tell Will Simp&s;on, as they &s;at at work, that &s;uch a dutiful daughter could hardly fail of making a faithful wife. He had not, however, the heart to try to draw her off from her care of her &s;ick mother. The poor woman declined ve|ry fa&s;t. Bet&s;y was much employed in in reading or praying by her while &s;he

<P>Mr. Stock knew that Bet&s;y would have little or nothing after her mother's death, as &s;he had only a life income. On the other hand Mr. Thomp&s;on, the Tanner, had offered him 200l. with his daughter Nancy. But he was almo&s;t &s;orry that he had not in this ca&s;e an op|portunity of re&s;i&s;ting his natural bias, which rather lay on the &s;ide of loving money: "For," &s;aid he, <Q>putting prin|ciple and putting affection out of the que&s;tion, I &s;hall do a more <HI>prudent</HI> thing by marrying Bet&s;y We&s;t, who will conform to her &s;tation, and is a re|ligious, humble, indu&s;trious girl, with|out a &s;hilling, than by having an idle dre&s;&s;y la&s;s, who will neglect my fami|ly and fill my hou&s;e with company, though &s;he &s;hould have twice the for|tune
<PB N="23" REF="037146_0022_100C9554988F9130">
which Nancy Thomp&s;on would bring.</Q></P>
<P>At length poor old Mrs. We&s;t was relea&s;ed from all her &s;ufferings. At a proper time Mr. Stock propo&s;ed marri|age to Bet&s;y, and was accepted. All the di&s;appointed girls in the town won|dered what any body could like in &s;uch a dowdy as that. Had the man no eyes? They thought Mr. Stock had more ta&s;te. Oh! how it did provoke all the vain idle things to find, that &s;taying at home; dre&s;&s;ing plainly, &s;erving God, and nur&s;|ing a blind mother, &s;hould do that for Bet&s;y We&s;t which all their contrivances, flaunting, and dancing could not do for them.</P>
<P>He was not di&s;appointed of meeting with a good wife in Bet&s;y, as indeed tho&s;e who marry on right grounds &s;el|dom are. But if religious per&s;ons will chu&s;e partners for life who have no religion, do not let them complain that they are unhappy; they might have known that beforehand. Tommy Wil|liams

was now taken home to Stock's hou&s;e and bound apprentice. He was always kind and attentive to his mother; and every penny which Will Simp&s;on or his ma&s;ter gave him for learning a chapter he would &s;ave to buy a bit of tea and &s;ugar for her. When the other boys laughed at him for being &s;o fooli&s;h as to deny him&s;elf cakes and apples to give his money to her who was &s;o bad a woman, he would an&s;wer, "it may be &s;o, but &s;he is my mother for all that."</P>
<P>Mr. Stock was much moved at the change in this boy, who turned out a very good youth. He re&s;olved, as God &s;hould pro&s;per him, that he would try to &s;natch other helple&s;s creatures from &s;in and ruin. "For" &s;aid he, "it is ow|ing to God's ble&s;&s;ing on the in&s;tructions of my good mini&s;ter when I was a child, that I have been &s;aved from the broad way of de&s;truction." He &s;till gave God the glory of every thing he did aright, and when Will Simp&s;on one day &s;aid to him, "Ma&s;ter, I wi&s;h I were half as good as you are." "William," an&s;wer|ed
<PB N="25" REF="037146_0024_100C955953ECFF78">
he gravely, "I once read in a book, that the Devil is willing enough we &s;hould appear to do good actions if he can but make us proud of them."</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t not forget our old acquaintance, Mr. Stock's fellow 'pren|tice. So you &s;hall now hear what befel idle Jack, who, being a farmer's &s;on, had many advantages to begin life with. But he who wants prudence may be &s;aid to want every thing, becau&s;e he turns all his advantages to no account.</P>
<P>Jack Brown was ju&s;t out of his time when his ma&s;ter Williams died in that terrible drunken fit at the Greyhound. You know already how Stock &s;ucceeded to his ma&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s, and pro&s;pered in it. Jack wi&s;hed very much to enter in|to partner&s;hip with him. His father and mother too were de&s;irous of it, and offered to advance a hundred pounds with him. Here is a fre&s;h proof of the power of a good character! the old far|mer, with all his covetou&s;ne&s;s, was eager to get his &s;on into partner&s;hip with
<PB N="26" REF="037146_0025_100C955AF793B4F8">
Stock, though the latter was not worth a &s;hilling, and even his mother, with all her pride was eager for it, for they had &s;en&s;e enough to &s;ee it would be the ma|king of Jack. The father knew that Stock would look to the main chance; and the mother that he would take the labouring oar, and &s;o her darling would have little to do.</P>
<P>Stock, however, young as he was, "was too old a bird to be caught with chaff." His wi&s;dom was an overmatch for their cunning. He had a kindne&s;s for Brown, but would on no account en|ter into bu&s;ine&s;s with him. "One of the&s;e three things," &s;aid he, "I am &s;ure of if I do; he will either hurt my princi|ples, my character, or my trade; perhaps all." And here&punc; by-the-by, let me drop a hint to other young men who are about to enter into partner&s;hip. Let them not do that in ha&s;te which they may repent at lei&s;ure. Next to marriage it is a tie the harde&s;t to break; and next to that it is an engagement which ought to be entered into with the utmo&s;t caution.
<PB N="27" REF="037146_0026_100C955C9C96A250">
Many things go to the making &s;uch a connection &s;uitable, &s;afe, and plea&s;ant. There is many a top man need not be above taking a hint in this re&s;pect from James Stock the Shoemaker.</P>
<P>Brown was &s;till unwilling to leave him, indeed he was too idle to look out for bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o he offered&punc; Stock to work with him as a journeyman; but this he al&s;o mildly refu&s;ed. It hurt his good nature to do &s;o; but he reflected that a young man who has his way to make in the world mu&s;t not only be good natured, he mu&s;t be prudent al&s;o. "I am re&s;olved" &s;aid he "to employ none but the mo&s;t &s;ober regular young men I can get. "Evil communications corrupt good manners," and I &s;hould be an&s;werable for all the di&s;orders of my own hou&s;e if I knowingly took a wild drinking young fellow into it. "That which might be kindne&s;s to one, would be inju&s;tice to many, and therefore a &s;in in my&s;elf."</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="037146_0027_100C955E29695180">
Brown's mother was in a great rage when &s;he heard that her &s;on had &s;tooped &s;o low as to make this offer. She thought pride was a grand thing. Poor woman! She did not know that it was the mean|e&s;t thing in the world. It was her ig|norance which made her proud, as is apt to be the ca&s;e. "You mean &s;pirited ra&s;|cal," &s;aid &s;he to Jack, "I had rather fol|low you to your grave, as well as I love you, than &s;ee you di&s;grace your family by working under Jem Stock the pari&s;h 'prentice." She forgot already what pains &s;he had taken about the partner|&s;hip, but pride and pa&s;&s;ion have a bad memory.</P>
<P>It is hard to &s;ay which was now upper-mo&s;t in her mind, her de&s;ire to be revenged on Stock, or to &s;ee her &s;on make a figure. She rai&s;ed every &s;hil|ling &s;he could get from her hu&s;band, and all &s;he could crib from the dairy to &s;et up Jack in a &s;howy way. So the very next market day &s;he came her&s;elf, and took for him the new white hou&s;e&punc; with the two little &s;a&s;h windows painted blue,
<PB N="29" REF="037146_0028_100C9561E5624830">
and blue po&s;ts before the door. It is that hou&s;e which has the old cro&s;s ju&s;t before it, as you turn down between the church and the greyhound. It's being &s;o near the church to be &s;ure was no re|commendation to Jack, but it's being &s;o near the greyhound was, and &s;o tak|ing one thing with the other it was to be &s;ure no bad &s;ituation; but what weigh|ed mo&s;t with the mother was, that it was a much more &s;howy &s;hop than Stock's, and the hou&s;e, though not half &s;o con|venient, was far more &s;mart.</P>
<P>In order to draw cu&s;tom, his fooli&s;h mother advi&s;ed him to under&s;ell his neighbours ju&s;t at fir&s;t; to buy ordinary but &s;howy goods, and employ cheap workmen. In &s;hort, &s;he charged him to leave no &s;tone unturned to ruin his old comrade Stock. Indeed &s;he always thought with double &s;atisfaction of Jack's pro&s;perity, becau&s;e &s;he always joined to it the hope that his &s;ucce&s;s would be the ruin of Stock, for &s;he owned it would be the joy of her heart to bring that proud up&s;tart to a mor&s;el of bread. She

did not under&s;tand for her part, why &s;uch beggars mu&s;t become trade&s;men, it was "making a velvet pur&s;e of a &s;ow's ear."</P>
<P>Stock however &s;et out on quite another &s;et of principles. He did not allow him&s;elf always to &s;quare his own beha|viour to others by their's to him. He &s;eldom a&s;ked him&s;elf what he &s;hould <HI>like</HI> to do; but he had a mighty way of &s;ay|ing, "I wonder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> what is my duty to do? And when he was once clear in that matter he generally did it. So in|&s;tead of &s;etting Brown at defiance; in|&s;tead of all that vulgar &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, of "catch he that catch can"&mdash;and "two of a trade can never agree," he re&s;olved to be friendly towards him. In&s;tead of joining in the laugh again&s;t him for mak|ing his hou&s;e &s;o fine, he was &s;orry for him, becau&s;e he feared he would never be able to pay &s;uch a rent. So he very kindly called upon him, told him there was bu&s;ine&s;s enough for them both, and gave him many u&s;eful hints for his go|ing on. He warned him to go oftner to

<P>For a &s;hort time things went on &s;wim|mingly. Brown was merry and civil. The &s;hop was well &s;ituated for go&s;&s;ip; and every one who had &s;omething to &s;ay and nothing to do was welcome. Every idle
