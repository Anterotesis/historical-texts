<P>THAT elevation and depre&s;&s;ion of the hu|man character, &s;o ob&s;ervable, forms one of tho&s;e &s;triking contra&s;ts in which nature &s;eems to delight in all her works. While, by a happy di&s;po&s;ition of circum&s;tances, the few fortunate travellers a&s;cend the lofty &s;ummit of human ho|nour and glory, the multitude, far below, move down the vale of ob&s;curity, unnoticed, into &s;oon-forgotten graves. Man, having opportunities and calls for con&s;tant exertion, finds his capa|cities unfolding, his mind growing to his &s;itua|tion,

till in the end he becomes as much greater than others, as his circle was larger. He may, by being placed in advantageous circum&s;tances in &s;ociety, be in&s;trumental of almo&s;t infinite good to millions; and generations yet unborn, as they ri&s;e, &s;hall call him ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT few &s;ituations will admit exten&s;ive u&s;eful|ne&s;s. The circle in which the greater part move is very confined; con&s;equently their u&s;efulne&s;s and fame are very limited. Happy for the world when the few elevated &s;eats in a nation are filled with truly great men, who delight in diffu&s;ing liberty, peace and happine&s;s through their exten|&s;ive circle of influence.</P>
<P>OUR text is the remark of David to his &s;ubjects, on the death of Abner, a di&s;tingui&s;hed General over the armies of I&s;rael. Above deception and revenge him&s;elf, he did not &s;u&s;pect them in one that called him&s;elf his friend. He fell a &s;acrifice to the ambition and revenge of a rival, who was jealous of his de&s;erving and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the pub|lic confidence and e&s;teem above him&s;elf.

bravery and &s;ucce&s;s as an officer, mo&s;t tenderly laments his premature fall; and by example teaches us the propriety of lamenting public characters, who have rendered e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices to their country and the world.</P>
<P>THERE is then a &s;en&s;e, in which man may, in the language of in&s;piration, be called great. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">all,</P>
<P N="1">I. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">NQUIRE what con&s;titutes a man great in the &s;en&s;e of our text.</P>
<P N="2">II. SHOW the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">opriety of publicly lamenting &s;uch men.</P>
<P N="1">I. We are to inquire what con&s;titutes man great. To give him this character in the judg|ment of the world, three things are principally im|portant.</P>
<P N="1">1. A MIND which can embrace large and exten|&s;ive views of human things. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> rea&s;on and intelligence a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, the higher he ri&s;es in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence. Men differ as much in their intellectual powers, as in the con&s;titution of their bodies. Some come into life with feeble
<PB N="8" REF="037944_0007_100F6C59C831DEB0">
con&s;titutions&mdash;always incapable of tho&s;e bodily labours and exertions, which others can &s;upport. So &s;ome have le&s;s intelligence&mdash;are incapable of &s;uch large, comprehen&s;ive views of things&mdash;and therefore incapacitated for acting upon a broad, exten&s;ive plan. The more exten&s;ive views a man has, the deeper he penetrates into men and things, the more noble creature he is. Hence the infi|nite intelligence of GOD&mdash;his cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f com|prehending perfectly all things in the univer&s;e&mdash; confer inconceivable dignity on the Divine Mind. Could we &s;uppo&s;e the Divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d to po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s intelligence&mdash;were his views dimini&s;hed&mdash;had he a le&s;s perfect acquaintance with all things&mdash;he would not be &s;o great as he now is. Exten&s;ive views of things&mdash;capacities equal to great occa|&s;ions&mdash;form the great man.</P>
<P N="2">2. SUCH a mind, to appear great, mu&s;t be placed in &s;uch ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">ances as admit of expre&s;&s;ing in <HI>action</HI> the&s;e enlightened conceptions. This is nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;uch a mind is due expan&s;ion, and call forth all its energies. Man is, in a great degree, the creature of circum&s;tances and occa|&s;ions.
<PB N="9" REF="037944_0008_100F6C5C34E5D308">
The mind enlarges by exerci&s;e, and, like the body, owes its growth and &s;trength to its own operation. Let a man po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t exten&s;ive views of things&mdash;great degrees of prudence, for|titude, and bravery&mdash;yet, if he is never called to act in a &s;ituation which demands the&s;e energies of mind, he cannot appear to po&s;&s;e&s;s them. There is fire in the flint; but, unle&s;s it is &s;mitten, it will not &s;hine. Hence great occa&s;ions always produce great men&mdash;di&s;play their greatne&s;s to the world&punc; Sea&s;ons of public and national danger have called forth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> men, who were able to take hold of the&s;e great events, and direct them with fortitude and prudence. The&s;e great events, and national concerns, are as familiar to &s;uch a mind, and conducted with as much ea&s;e and or|der, as others guide their little dome&s;tic affairs. There is real greatne&s;s and dignity in a mind equal to great events&mdash;which can direct them with a &s;teady hand. When we ca&s;t our eyes up|on the heavens, and ob&s;erve their order, their motions, and revolutions, how great does that All-pre&s;iding Mind appear, which can direct all
<PB N="10" REF="037944_0009_100F6C5F8C8A8688">
their movements! In this way the powers of the Divine Mind are exhibited, and GOD appears great. It is in <HI>action</HI> that a being appears great. When we &s;ee a man forming great de&s;igns, and with facility carrying them into effect, he appears great. Actions, in which great wi&s;dom, pru|dence, courage and fortitude are di&s;played, indi|cate a great mind.</P>
<P N="3">3. TRUE greatne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in directing the&s;e exten&s;ive views, and great actions, to the good of mankind. To be great as agents of de&s;truction&mdash; in diffu&s;ing mi&s;ery&mdash;is the greatne&s;s of devils. This has been the greatne&s;s of many men, in all ages of the world. Many, before and &s;ince the Macedonian and the Swede, have performed ac|tions which have a&s;toni&s;hed the world, with de|&s;ign only to &s;hackle and exterminate the human race. Such men abundantly merit the eternal execrations of GOD and man. Could we &s;uppo&s;e that Deity created the world, and peopled it with rational creatures, with intention of making them all mi&s;erable; &s;uch a de&s;ign, and &s;uch an ope|ration, could not be called great, but infinitely

dreadful. In what an amiable point of light do the de&s;igns and actions of Je&s;us Chri&s;t appear, a|bove tho&s;e, for in&s;tance, of Alexander! Both po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed exten&s;ive de&s;igns, and performed great actions: but look at their objects: one went forth to conquer and de&s;troy the world; and, when he had done it, wept that there was not another world to encrim&s;on with its blood.

<P N="2">II. THE propriety of lamenting &s;uch characters, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they fall. <HI>Know ye not that there is a great man fallen this day in I&s;rael&punc;</HI> This language could be adopted in no age, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no nation, with more propriety than by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he people of America this day.

America is fallen upon one of her high places. In him, how much worth has left our land and world! From Mount Vernon, the great, the excellent WASHINGTON, like Mo&s;es from Pi&s;gah, has taken his flight to heaven, and, like him, left a nation in tears. He has left us, and left us without the con&s;olation which Mo&s;es gave his people&mdash;<HI>that</HI> GOD <HI>would rai&s;e them up another like unto him.</HI> This hope we can hardly indulge.

When a man of &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed worth; who hath rendered &s;uch eminent &s;ervices to his country; when he falls a victim to death, we may &s;ay&mdash;<HI>A great man indeed hath fallen in our I&s;rael.</HI> Not to notice his death, would indicate forgetfulne&s;s of his &s;ervices, and ingratitude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> GOD, who rai&s;ed him up as our National Saviour.</P>
<P>MEN, who have benefited the world by their example and active &s;ervices, are public ble&s;&s;ings to the human race. It is a di&s;tingui&s;hed favour to a people to have a truly great man in &s;ome
<PB N="13" REF="037944_0012_100F6C664E8FF378">
important po&s;t in &s;ociety. His example is mo&s;t &s;alutary on the public mind. To &s;ee a man con|&s;tantly acting from noble, di&s;intere&s;ted views&mdash; &s;acrificing private con&s;iderations for the public good&mdash;employing his enlightened mind in form|ing ju&s;t and noble plans for national pro&s;perity and happine&s;s&mdash;to &s;ee him directing the com|plicated concerns of a nation with &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;tends to elevate the mind, and expo&s;e that low &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s, which cannot &s;acrifice a little private good for public happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE example of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is frequently propo&s;ed, in &s;cripture, for the imitation and im|provement of chri&s;tians. So the example of a great man, in &s;ocial, civil and military life, may conduce to the improvement of mankind in all the&s;e characters. No man hath more adorned the character of the private citizen, &s;oftened and hum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed that of the &s;oldier, and dignified that of the &s;tate&s;man, than GEORGE WASHING|TON. We have &s;een him great in coun&s;el and in arms&mdash;crowned with &s;ucce&s;s and glory, both in the cabinet and field; yet mode&s;t&mdash;not eleva|ted
<PB N="14" REF="037944_0013_100F6C67D15EB760">
with his own greatne&s;s, not dazzled with the &s;plendor of his own great actions, nor intoxicated with the prai&s;es of millions&mdash;indeed of the world. We have &s;een him mode&s;tly declining the ap|plau&s;es of tho&s;e whom he had &s;o eminently bene|fited by his labours and toils. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that fine &s;en&s;ibility of &s;oul which ever accompanies true greatne&s;s, he blu&s;hed at his own de&s;erved ho|nours: and we have &s;een his manly countenance, which was never di&s;compo&s;ed by fear, &s;oftened in|to a profu&s;ion of tears, at the re&s;pect of a grateful people. A little mind, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, would be lifted into a god; and never would be &s;atisfied, unle&s;s his humble wor&s;hippers had bowed the knee, and in the language of ea&s;tern idolaters &s;aid, <HI>O king, live forever.</HI> But a great mind is &s;atisfied with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having benefited man|kind. This is more acceptable and plea&s;ing to it, than all their applau&s;es. The death of &s;uch a man &s;hould be lamented for the lo&s;s of his ex+ample.</P>
<P>DEATH hath al&s;o clo&s;ed the &s;cene of his public and important &s;ervices for his country. When
<PB N="15" REF="037944_0014_100F6C6A3A931E00">
the head of a ri&s;ing family, who guides his affairs with prudence, is taken away, the lo&s;s to them is great. He can no more return to his hou&s;e. They can no more be benefited by his coun&s;els and labours. A nation may be as greatly benefit|ed by &s;ome great public character, as a family is by its prudent, indu&s;trious head. A &s;ingle man may, under GOD, really de&s;erve the character of the <HI>deliverer and &s;aviour</HI> of his country; and may, by his coun&s;els and dangers, tran&s;mit from one generation to another the invaluable ble&s;&s;ings of liberty and good government to millions, when he is no more. A nation may, after being e&s;&s;entially benefited by the exten&s;ive views, and active la|bours, of &s;ome great character, &s;till need his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in &s;ea&s;ons of national danger and di&s;tre&s;s. The reputation and influence of a man who is great in coun&s;el and arms, and who hath pro&s;|pered in whatever he hath put his hand to, tend greatly to di&s;may the enemies, and animate the friends, of his country. In this view the death of WASHINGTON is a public lo&s;s, and greatly to be lamented in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="037944_0015_100F6C6E6DCD3070">WE are ju&s;tified in &s;cripture in lamenting this great man; and we feel it no profanation of this day, to bring into view our national obligations to that great, that excellent man, who is no more. Death hath &s;hown us he was but man: and in lamenting him we are countenanced by abundant &s;criptural examples. When we read the biogra|phical memoirs of di&s;tingui&s;hed men, who have e&s;&s;entially benefited their generation and po&s;teri|ty, and follow them to the clo&s;ing hour of life, we find a general &s;orrow to prevail. It &s;eems a com|mon &s;entiment of human nature, that &s;uch men &s;hould not de&s;cend into the grave without general te&s;timonials of public re&s;pect. Mankind have, in all ages and countries, generally united in bedew|ing the grave of a benefactor with their tears. Such &s;entiments and conduct are certainly ratio|nal; and the public expre&s;&s;ion of them is due to di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, and eminent public &s;ervices. Let the hear&s;e of the in&s;ignificant and worthle&s;s-great be followed by a proce&s;&s;ion of mercenary mourners, who &s;eek to hide the tears they do not &s;hed&mdash;let them purcha&s;e the &s;orrow which their

merit cannot excite&mdash;let them rear their proud monuments, and flattery lavi&s;h her in&s;criptions, to perpetuate and emblazon a worthle&s;s name;&mdash; WASHINGTON has a living monument&mdash;a monument in every heart, deeply in&s;cribed with his actions and virtues&mdash;a monument, which will be rebuilt in every future generation, and will crumble only with the &s;kies. America mourns&mdash; her tears will fall, as liberal and pure as the drops of heaven. He was her father; and her &s;ons will remember that the &s;oil which they reap, and the ocean which laves their &s;hores, were &s;ecured by his toils. And her fair daughters will recollect that WASHINGTON made them mothers&mdash;not of a degraded race of &s;laves, but of a free, indepen|dent nation.</P>
<P>EVERY man is bound to commit the remains of a father to the grave with decency and re&s;pect. So a nation may be under obligations to commit the &s;acred a&s;hes of a public benefactor to the grave with re&s;pect and tears: and &s;hould they withhold them, the &s;tones might reprove their in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>MOSES, in every view, was a great man. He
<PB N="18" REF="037944_0017_100F6C74246598B0">
was rai&s;ed up to break Egyptian chains, and libe|rate a great nation. He put him&s;elf at their head, fought their battles, &s;hared their toils, gave them a &s;y&s;tem of civil government, and through a long life admini&s;tered it with undeviating integrity; rai&s;|ed them to great national re&s;pectability, and put their dread on &s;urrounding nations. After a long life thus &s;pent, he &s;uddenly, like our American Mo&s;es, drops mortality, and dwells with his GOD. Though individuals, envying his honour, had faulted his admini&s;tration, and excited in&s;urrec|tion, &s;till he was venerated in life, and greatly la|mented in death. We are informed that <HI>the chil|dren of I&s;rael wept for Mo&s;es, in the plains of Moab, thirty days.</HI></P>
<P>IN being ju&s;t to acknowledge all our national de|liverances, and public mercies, as the gifts of GOD, we &s;hould not overlook tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed in&s;tru|ments by which they have been conveyed. We may rob man, as well as GOD, in withholding from him his de&s;erved &s;hare of love and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>THE MAN, &s;o ju&s;tly de&s;erving the love and re|&s;pect of AMERICA, is now no more. By his pru|dence, fortitude and &s;ucce&s;s, he hath received the
<PB N="19" REF="037944_0018_100F6C75F4CA5BC8">
applau&s;es of the world. Rai&s;ed up, like Mo&s;es, to redeem a people from foreign domination, with a like mode&s;ty he accepted from Congre&s;s, in 1775, the command of the American forces. Contend|ing with veteran troops, and generals who had figured on the European &s;tage of war, he was found their &s;uperior in the day of battle. Early did he &s;tep forth in the expiring cau&s;e of liberty. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uperior fortitude to &s;upport evils, and bravery to front dangers, he nobly triumphed in the field; generou&s;ly refu&s;ing any compen&s;ation for all his toils, but that divine one, of having ren|dered the mo&s;t important &s;ervices to his country. Through a long, arduous revolution, he finally led us to victory, independence and glory. He then returned to his peaceful home, with the ble&s;&s;ings of his country.</P>
<P>AT a period perhaps equally difficult, he was called by the voice of his grateful &s;ons, to &s;ave them&mdash;not from the ravages of a foreign enemy, but one &s;till wor&s;e&mdash;dome&s;tic di&s;cord and in&s;ur|rection. Rai&s;ed to the Pre&s;idential chair, his pla&s;|tic hand &s;oon healed our civil wounds, and re&s;tor|ed us to a &s;tate of political vigour and happine&s;s.
<PB N="20" REF="037944_0019_100F6C77958012F8">
Having filled the chair, for eight years, with ex|ten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s, dignity and glory, he declined the future &s;uffrages of his country. He claimed an exemption from the oppre&s;&s;ive cares of public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;a retirement &s;o plea&s;ing to increa&s;ing years, and a mind worn in the public good. To Mount Vernon we &s;aw him retire, to &s;eek repo&s;e in the tranqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;cenes of private life. There our thoughts attended him; and our prayers a&s;cended, that he might enjoy every &s;ocial and religious plea&s;ure, protracted to a good old age, and then be gently laid to re&s;t in the lap of our common mother.</P>
<P>BY the threats and lawle&s;s depredations of a na|tion of robbers and athei&s;ts, the con&s;tituted au|thority of our country invited him to the fir&s;t military command in the nation. And, to the joy of America, he accepted the appointment. In this high command Death found him labouring for the good of his country.</P>
<P>SINCE Mo&s;es, no people have owed more to any one man, than America does to that beloved name, GEORGE WASHINGTON. Like Mo&s;es, he had &s;ome enemies&mdash;&s;ufficient to prove his worth. This is a tribute which great worth

mu&s;t pay. The&s;e men have proved them&s;elves the enemies of all civil and religious order and happine&s;s. While in office, they have been con|tinually pining away with un&s;atisfied de&s;ires to &s;ee him blunder in his political race, and plunge from his eminent &s;tation of u&s;efulne&s;s and glory into ob&s;curity and contempt. As the &s;ore, wounded eye is pained by the cheering rays of the &s;un, &s;o envy is tortured at &s;uch a con&s;tellation of virtues as di&s;tingui&s;hed the illu&s;trious WASHINGTON. While his few enemies have impatiently beheld his wi&s;dom and inflexible integrity, we have en|joyed every ble&s;&s;ing which the nature of his ap|pointment would admit. About the term of &s;ix|teen years hath this great man conducted our arms and councils; at the head of which, he hath appeared the brave, the fortunate, the hu|mane General, and the wi&s;e, the prudent, the accompli&s;hed State&s;man. In the&s;e wide, exten&s;ive fields has he gathered laurels which will never fade while liberty and good policy are known in the world. The circum&s;tances of his life have been remarkable. He has always been the honour and glory of his offices. In&s;tead of wearing them out,
<PB N="22" REF="037944_0021_100F6C7C5B2DCF38">
he hath clothed them with increa&s;ing u&s;efulne&s;s and glory. No man ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a reputation for prudence and integrity more un&s;potted, and a character which the world has more generally ad|mired. His humanity, his public &s;pirit, with his many other virtues, will be applauded by po&s;|terity.</P>
<P>AS to his religion, let charity follow him into the noi&s;e and confu&s;ion of the camp&mdash;into the perplexing cares of government&mdash;and ob&s;erve his con&s;tant devotional retirement, which he was known to practi&s;e; let her &s;ee him in his hou&s;e, bowing before the SUPREME MAJESTY with the lowe&s;t of his fellow creatures; let her &s;ee his de|votions in the church; let her connect his reve|rence of GOD with his love of man, and would &s;he not &s;ay, <HI>Truly, this is a righteous man?</HI></P>
<P>THIS great man has now bid a final adieu to his family, to his country, and the world. The mournful tidings are now circulating our country, and will &s;oon reach the di&s;tant corners of the globe. It will long be remembered, that GEORGE WASHINGTON, after a life of ex|ten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s, and un&s;potted honour and glo|ry,
<PB N="23" REF="037944_0022_100F6C7EE2462F68">
terminated his mortal exi&s;tence on the four|teenth of December, 1799, in the &s;ixty-eighth year of his age; ripe in days and virtue.</P>
<P>WE have dwelt with mournful plea&s;ure on his memory; but we mu&s;t bid him adieu&mdash;a long adieu! Farewell, happy &s;hade! We will recount thy virtues and patriotic labours for the improve|ment and admiration of our ri&s;ing offspring: ear|ly &s;hall they learn to li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> thy name, and hail thee as the benefactor and &s;aviour of their country.</P>
<P>MEN, BRETHREN AND FATHERS,</P>
<P>WE now &s;ee what man is&mdash;what the great man is. Such men ri&s;e, like the &s;un, to gladden and ble&s;s the world; like him they run their cour&s;e with exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s and glory, and then go down and leave the world in night. Mo&s;es and Jo&s;hua, David and Solomon, with all the other deliverers and benefactors of mankind, after hav|ing &s;erved their generation and the world in the mo&s;t acceptable manner, mu&s;t fall a&s;leep. They mu&s;t leave the throne, the council and the field, and retire where "kings and &s;laves have equal thrones." When the mighty fall, and the high|e&s;t
