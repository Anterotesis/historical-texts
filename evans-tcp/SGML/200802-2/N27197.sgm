<P>HAVING laboured nearly &s;ix years to no pur|po&s;e, to per&s;uade the citizens of Philadelphia that the yellow fever is of dome&s;tic origin, I had con|cluded to de&s;i&s;t from all further attempts to produce conviction upon this &s;ubject; but a retro&s;pect of the &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s which I have witne&s;&s;ed from that terrible di&s;ea&s;e, and the dread of &s;eeing them &s;peedily renewed, with aggravated circum&s;tances, have induced me to make one more effort to pre|vent them, by pointing out their cau&s;es, and re|medies. I anticipate from it, a renewal of the ca|lumnies to which my opinion of the origin of our annual calamity has expo&s;ed me; but the&s;e will be le&s;s difficult to bear, than the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of truths which involve in their con&s;equences the pro&s;perity of our city, and the lives of many thou&s;and people, whom poverty and de&s;pair will finally compel to

<HEAD>Of the Remote Cau&s;es of the Yellow Fever.</HEAD>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e is the offspring of putrid vegetable and animal exhalations in all countries.&mdash;It prevails only in hot climates and &s;ea&s;ons.&mdash;The &s;ources of it in Philadelphia are chiefly the following&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. The docks; the&s;e contain a large quantity of filthy matters in a highly concentrated &s;tate. They are fir&s;t acted upon, by the heat of the &s;un, and hence &s;ailors and the inhabitants of Water &s;treet, are generally the fir&s;t per&s;ons who are affected by the yellow fever every year. It is derived to fre|quently from the docks in New York, that it has obtained there, the name of the <HI>dock</HI> fever.</P>
<P N="2">2. The foul air of &s;hips.</P>
<P N="3">3. The common &s;ewers. A yellow fever was produced by a large &s;ewer in Calcutta. It was af|terwards prevented by clo&s;ing it up, and removing the filth of the city in another way.</P>
<P N="4">4. The gutters.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="5" REF="036253_0004_1008A93C9250D3D8">5. Dirty cellars and yards.&mdash;Foul air is &s;ometimes generated in cellars which produces &s;poradic ca&s;es of fever in all &s;ea&s;ons of the year. Swen Warner died of a yellow fever on the 30th of January 1799, received by breathing the air of a cellar which had been &s;hut up for &s;everal months.</P>
<P N="6">6. Privies. An epidemic fever was once traced to this &s;ource in the city of Frankfort in Germany.</P>

<P>All the phy&s;icians in our city agree in deriving the common bilious fever and dy&s;entery from the&s;e &s;ources; now as the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es have, we are told, by the College of Phy&s;icians, "lately very much dimini&s;hed,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Facts, and Ob&s;ervations, p. 24.</NOTE> and as the putrid exhalations &s;till continue, the pre&s;umption is, that they pro|duce our higher grade of bilious, which is the yel|low fever.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Cau&s;e of the Yellow Fever not occurring more frequently before the Year <HI>1793.</HI></HEAD>
<P>It has often been a&s;ked, "Why did not the yellow fever prevail in Philadelphia before the year 1793, particularly in the year 1778, when it was left in a more filthy &s;tate by the Briti&s;h army than it has been at any time &s;ince?" To this, I an&s;wer, that for the production of our pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e, three things are nece&s;&s;ary, 1. Putrid exhalations, 2. An inflammatory con&s;titution of the atmo&s;phere, and 3. An exciting cau&s;e, &s;uch as great heat, cold, fatigue from riding, walking, &s;wimming, gun|ning, or unu&s;ual labour, intemperance in eating, or drinking, ice creams, indige&s;tible aliment, or a violent emotion of the mind. The fir&s;t cau&s;e acts but feebly without the concurrence of the &s;econd, producing mild di&s;ea&s;es only, &s;uch as common re|mitting and intermitting fevers. By the co-opera|tion of an inflammatory con&s;titution of the air, we ob&s;erve not only common bilious fevers, have be|come malignant, but all tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which are occa&s;ioned by the &s;en&s;ible qualities of the air, have a&s;&s;umed a more violent character. This has been remarked by mo&s;t of the phy&s;icians of Philadel|phia for &s;everal years pa&s;t. The pleuri&s;y, rheu|mati&s;m, gout, hives and &s;everal other di&s;ea&s;es, re|quire remedies of twice as much force to &s;ubdue
<PB N="7" REF="036253_0006_1008A949C52BC6B8">
them, as they did ten years ago. On what circum|&s;tances this change of the atmo&s;phere depends is not known. But the fact is certain. It was taken notice of by Hippocrates two thou&s;and years ago, and is mentioned over and over in the writings of Dr. Sy|denham. The records of medicine prove, that it has continued from one year, to fifty-two years in different countries. Dr. Sims has given along and intere&s;ting account of the&s;e inflammatory con&s;ti|tutions of the atmo&s;phere from the year 1590 to 1782, in the fir&s;t volume of the Manche&s;ter me|moirs, from which it appears that they were &s;ome|times general over Europe, and at other times con|fined to particular countries. The pe&s;tilential con|&s;titution of the air in the United States began in 1791. This I infer from the yellow fever making its appearance that year in New-York&mdash;It pre|vailed in Charle&s;ton in 1792, and it has been epi|demic in one or more of the cities and country towns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been a&s;&s;erted, that this fever is confined exclu|&s;ively to our &s;ea ports. This is an error. It has prevailed &s;ince the year 1793 in many of the villages of New England, and of the &s;outhern &s;tates. On the Gene&s;ee river in the &s;tate of New York, it has become to prevalent as to acquire the name of the <HI>Gene&s;ee</HI> fever. The bilious fevers which prevail|ed in all the above places before the year 1793, were of a mild nature, and &s;eldom mortal. They have lately di&s;ap|peared, or are very much "dimini&s;hed," and have been &s;ucceeded by a fever which frequently terminates in death in five days with a yellow &s;kin and a black vomiting. The&s;e facts have been communicated to me by letters, from phy&s;i|cians, and by other gentlemen, who have been eye witne&s;&s;es of them. To doubt of their truth, would lead to a di&s;be|lief in human te&s;timony, upon all other &s;ubjects.</NOTE> of the United States every year &s;ince.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="036253_0007_1008A94B57D716A0">We ob&s;erve the effects of changes in the qualities of the atmo&s;phere not only upon di&s;ea&s;es, but up|on animal and vegetable life. In&s;ects of different kinds have lately appeared and multiplied in an un|u&s;ual manner, and the fruits of the earth have ri|pened, and decayed in many in&s;tances &s;ooner than in common years. The&s;e facts have been noticed by the farmers in every part of the United States. The uncommon mortality in the &s;ummer and autum|nal months, among hor&s;es, cattle and the cats, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, is an additional proof of a change in our atmo&s;phere. It has ari&s;en probably from the &s;ame cau&s;e which has increa&s;ed the mortality of our annual epidemic. As a further an&s;wer to the que&s;|tion under this head, it might be a&s;ked, why was not the fever imported oftener before the year 1791? It is &s;eldom ab&s;ent from the We&s;t-India i&s;lands. It raged in mo&s;t of them during the two wars previous to the pre&s;ent, and yet but one in|&s;tance occurred of it in the United States in tho&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="036253_0008_1008A94FBA2B01A8">
two periods of &s;even years each, and that was in Philadelphia in the year 1762. The intercour&s;e between our cities and the i&s;lands during that time was exten&s;ive and con&s;tant, particularly in the war between the years 1756 and 1763. (Quarantine laws then exi&s;ted in but few of our cities, and where they did, they were feebly executed or eluded every day.</P>
<P>It has been a&s;ked,</P>
<P><HI>Why does not the yellow fever prevail</HI> every year in <HI>cities, where the filth is always the &s;ame in its quantity</HI> and <HI>quality.</HI> To this I an&s;wer, that filth may be in two &s;tates in which it will not pro|duce this di&s;ea&s;e, viz. a <HI>dry,</HI> and a <HI>liquid</HI> &s;tate. From exce&s;&s;ive heat or from heavy rains, it is of|ten in one of tho&s;e conditions in our cities. When this is the ca&s;e, they e&s;cape a vi&s;itation from this di&s;ea&s;e. It is only when filth is acted upon by a hot &s;un in a <HI>moist</HI> &s;tate that it produces fevers. The Neck below Philadelphia which has been &s;ub|ject to the bilious fever, time immemorial, was uncommonly healthy in the autumn of 1793; ow|ing to the low grounds there being completely dried by the hot weather of that &s;ea&s;on. Fell's Point near Baltimore I have been informed e&s;caped the yellow fever in 1798 from a &s;imilar cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="036253_0009_1008A9522135F400">I &s;hall illu&s;trate the origin of the yellow fever by a familiar &s;imile. The foul air of our city may be compared to gunpowder with which the bodies of our citizens are charged from the beginning of &s;ummer. The atmo&s;phere may be compared to &s;parks of fire. Heat, cold, fatigue, intemperance and the other exciting cau&s;es which have been mentioned, may be compared to a <HI>hand,</HI> which combines the&s;e &s;parks, with the gunpowder ac|cumulated in our bodies. The concurrence of all the&s;e cau&s;es is nece&s;&s;ary to produce a yellow fever. Putrid exhalations act but feebly upon the body, unle&s;s they are aided by the inflammatory activity of the atmo&s;phere. This atmo&s;phere in like manner, acts but feebly upon the body with|out the concurrence of putrid exhalations. Both of them for the mo&s;t part, require the <HI>hand</HI> of an exciting cau&s;e to produce the di&s;ea&s;e. An exciting cau&s;e without them, is harmle&s;s, or induces only a tran&s;ient indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P><HI>If putrid exhalations produce the yellow fever, it has been a&s;ked, why are tho&s;e neighbourhoods &s;ome|times healthy that are constantly expo&s;ed to their offen|&s;ive &s;mell?</HI> This que&s;tion may be an&s;wered by re|&s;orting to the effects of habit upon the &s;y&s;tem, which renders it in&s;en&s;ible after a while, of irritat|ing impre&s;&s;ions. The noxious matter which pro|duces

the yellow fever exi&s;ts independently of &s;mell, and is probably not formed till after that proce&s;s of fermentation is ended, which evolves the faetor from putrefying animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances. This faetor, like the rattle of the &s;nake, &s;eems to have been intended to give us no|tice of our danger, and to remove, or fly from the filth which emits it. It is po&s;&s;ible it may in &s;ome ca&s;es predominate &s;o much in its action upon the &s;y&s;tem over that matter which produces the fever, as to defend the body from its morbid effects. It is thus, the <HI>constant</HI> &s;timulus of &s;pirituous liquors has been found effectual in &s;ome in&s;tances in pre|&s;erving <HI>habitual</HI> drunkards from the yellow fever.</P>

<HEAD>Is the Yellow Fever a Contagious Di&s;ea&s;e?</HEAD>
<P>To an&s;wer this que&s;tion, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that contagion is of two kinds.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It is <HI>&s;ecreted</HI> as in the &s;mall pox and mea&s;les, in which &s;tate it acts uniformly and without the aid of exciting cau&s;es, upon per&s;ons of all ages and con&s;titutions who have not been previou&s;ly ex|po&s;ed to it, and is not controuled by the obvious changes in the weather.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="12" REF="036253_0011_1008A9578C591E18">2dly. It is derived from certain matters di&s;|charged from the body which afterwards by &s;tag|nation, or confinement, undergo &s;uch a change, as to partake of the &s;ame nature as the putrid ex|halations which produce the fever. If the breath, per&s;piration, and other excretions of a per&s;on in a yellow fever be confined in a &s;mall clo&s;e room, they may produce a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e, e&s;pecially when they act upon a body previou&s;ly debilitated by grief, or fatigue. But they are generally inoffen&s;ive, where the &s;ick are accommodated in open well ventilated &s;ituations. Out of upwards of one thou&s;and per&s;ons who have carried this di&s;ea&s;e into the country from our cities, there are not more than three or four in&s;tances to be met with, of its having been propagated by contagion. In the city ho&s;pital of Philadelphia, there was no in&s;tance of this di&s;ea&s;e being contagious in 1793, 1797, and 1798. The fever of which Dr. Cooper died in the ho&s;pital la&s;t year, Dr. Phy&s;ick a&s;&s;ures me was derived from the exhalations of Water-&s;treet, which place he vi&s;ited a few days before he &s;icken|ed, in order to examine the &s;tate of the air in that unhealthy part of the city. The di&s;ea&s;e peri&s;hed when carried from Fell's Point to Baltimore in 1794. The &s;ame fate attended it, when it was carried from the places in New York and Bo&s;ton
<PB N="13" REF="036253_0012_1008A95C007C1988">
in which it was generated, to di&s;tant parts of tho&s;e cities. Clothes impregnated with the effluvia of a per&s;on who had died of the yellow fever might produce a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e, but it would be only in con&s;equence of tho&s;e effluvia partaking of the nature of putrid matters derived from any other animal &s;ource.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the year 1793 I &s;uppo&s;ed many ca&s;es of the yellow fever to be derived from contagion, which I now believe were produced by noxious exhalations. I did not at that time know, the di&s;tance to which tho&s;e exhalations might be conveyed. From my ignorance of this fact, I was mi&s;led by tho&s;e authors who &s;uppo&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e to &s;pread in the We&s;t Indies by contagion. Many late inquiries have con|vinced me, that this is not the ca&s;e. There is a &s;mell of a peculiar kind emitted by per&s;ons in a yellow fever which &s;ometimes produces di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations in the attendants, but &s;imilar effects are produced from a hundred other &s;mells which do not occa&s;ion a fever.</NOTE> The &s;ame thing may be &s;aid of the efflu|via emitted from a putrefying dead body.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the We&s;t India i&s;lands, pains were taken by &s;everal phy&s;icians, to prove that the yellow fever was imported from Siam into the We&s;t Indies. I was educated in the belief of this opinion, but the te&s;timony of many learned, and eminent modern phy&s;icians, has convinced me that it is a vulgar error, and that the di&s;ea&s;e is

generated there as it is here, by putrid exhalations. To the names of Drs. Huck, Hillary, Hunter, Hec|tor, M'Lean, and Clark, I &s;hall add tho&s;e of Doc|tors Jack&s;on, Borland, Pinkard and Scott, phy&s;i|cians to the Briti&s;h army in the We&s;t Indies, who lately vi&s;ited this city. They all denied the conta|gious nature of the yellow fever in the We&s;t In|dies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following extract from Dr. James Clark's hi&s;tory of the yellow fever in the i&s;land of Dominica, in the years 1793, 4, 5, 6, contains an epitome of the opinions of all the medical gentlemen who&s;e names are mentioned with his, up|on the origin and noncontagious quality of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P><P>"According to Dr. Lining's account of this fever in Charle&s;ton, South Carolina, communicated in the E&s;&s;ays Phy&s;ical and Literary, Vol. 2, it appears to have broken out there in the years 1732, 1739, 1745 and 1748; he thinks it was always imported from the We&s;t Indies; but gives no proof, nor even rea&s;on, in &s;upport of this opinion, which does not &s;eem to be well founded.</P><P>"At Fort Royal, in Martinique, where there is a great pre|valence of mephitic effluvia, ari&s;ing from the mar&s;hy ground at the back of the town, it generally broke out in the &s;ummer or autumnal &s;ea&s;on, on the arrival of troops from France, or of a number of &s;eamen, who had never been in the We&s;t In|dies before; and the &s;ame thing happened at Point a Petre, in Grand Terre, Gaudaloupe, almo&s;t annually, and from the &s;ame cau&s;e; but it was never looked upon <HI>as an infectious di&s;ea&s;e;</HI> nor did it ever &s;pread among the natives of the towns nor among tho&s;e who were &s;ea&s;oned to the climate; nor was it <HI>ever carried from thence</HI> to the other i&s;lands. In this i&s;land few ca&s;es have occurred for the&s;e la&s;t twenty years; and the&s;e have chiefly been at Prince Rupert's Head, where from the <HI>&s;tagnated water</HI> in a large mora&s;s near the town and fort, the <HI>mar&s;h mia&s;ma</HI> prevails in a high degree. Since the &s;wampy places which were in the town Rou&s;eau have <HI>been filled up,</HI> this fever has been &s;eldom ob&s;erved; but previous to the year 1792, we had generally violent thunder &s;torms&mdash;heavy rains&mdash;or &s;evere gales of wind, during the autumnal &s;ea&s;on.</P><P>"M. De&s;portes, in his Hi&s;toire des Maladies de St. Domin|gue, during the fourteen years that he kept a journal of the di&s;ea&s;es at Cape Fran&ccedil;ois and Fort Dauphin, &s;ound that this fever broke out con&s;tantly in tho&s;e towns upon the arrival of new-comers from France, and among the&s;e, only &s;uch as had not been formerly in that climate. In and about the&s;e towns, during the&s;e fourteen years, viz. from the year 1732 till 1746, there were a great <HI>many inlets of the &s;ea,</HI> where the water continued long in a <HI>&s;tagnated &s;tate,</HI> which in &s;o <HI>hot a place</HI> produced very <HI>offen&s;ive exhalations;</HI> to the&s;e he attributes this fever, and the bilious and other di&s;ea&s;es that prevailed at the &s;ame time.</P><P>"From a firm belief that this di&s;ea&s;e is by no <HI>means contagious</HI> in our i&s;land, the &s;ick are not abandoned by their friends, nor neglected by their attendants, which contributes much to the recovery of many, who would otherwi&s;e have been lo&s;t for want of care." In Dr. Jack&s;on's treati&s;e upon the fevers of Jamaica, he &s;uppo&s;es the bilious and yellow fever to be different di&s;ea&s;es. Since his late return from the We&s;t Indies, and this country, he has publi&s;hed the re&s;ult of his ob&s;ervations upon the yellow fever, in which he retracts the opinion of its being a &s;pecific di&s;ea&s;e, and proves it to be a high grade of bilious fever.</P></NOTE>&mdash;In tho&s;e ca&s;es where a fever appeared to

The fevers which have been imported into Philadelphia from Holland and Ire|land in pa&s;&s;enger &s;hips, were of this nature.

<P>The power which heavy rains, and fro&s;t have of <HI>destroying</HI> our fever, clearly prove that it does not &s;pread by contagion. We have &s;een it check|ed three times, in three different years by fro&s;ty nights. The cold in the&s;e ca&s;es cannot act upon the di&s;ea&s;e in our hou&s;es, and of cour&s;e it does not alter the quality of the matters di&s;charged from the bodies of the &s;ick.

by phy&s;icians in other countries, there is rea|&s;on to believe the a&s;&s;ertions of tho&s;e two phy&s;ici|ans are altogether without foundation.&mdash;The Col|lege of Phy&s;icians of Philadelphia after two weeks inve&s;tigation, were unable to di&s;cover any &s;hips, clothes, or &s;ick per&s;on, that could have introduced the di&s;ea&s;e into Philadelphia in the year 1793. The Academy of Medicine have clearly proved, by many documents, that the di&s;ea&s;e was not imported in the years 1797 and 1798. The origin of a few ca&s;es, reported by Dr. Griffitts and other members of the College of Phy&s;icians, which have lately ap|peared in our city, has in vain been &s;ought for from a prize &s;loop of the Ganges. Two affidavits of Me&s;&s;ieurs Hill and Inger&s;ol, prove that &s;he had been healthy in the We&s;t Indies, and that no per|&s;on had been &s;ick on board of her during her voy|age, nor after her arrival in our port. Equally un&s;ucce&s;sful have been the attempts to derive tho&s;e ca&s;es, from beds, and blankets infected by the fe|ver of la&s;t year. In Bo&s;ton, Connecticut, New York, Baltimore, Norfolk and Charle&s;ton, both phy&s;icians and citizens have long ago rejected the opinion of the importation of the fever. Some phy|&s;icians &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible for the contagion of this fever to adhere to the timbers of &s;hips that have &s;ailed from We&s;t India ports, and that it may be propagated from them to a whole neighbourhood,

although hou&s;es, and even &s;treets, interpo&s;e be|tween them. This opinion is too ab&s;urd to &s;tand in need of refutation. Indeed every thing that re|lates to the importation of this fever is contrary to rea&s;on and facts.&mdash;It is an error, &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of a belief that all pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es were derived from the planets.&mdash;The exi&s;tence of a health-law founded upon this error, in the clo&s;e of the eighteenth century, and in a city abounding with literary in&s;titutions, will appear incredible to po&s;terity. Thinking men alone will di&s;cover its po&s;&s;ibility, in their knowledge of the nature of the human mind. It is po&s;&s;ible this law may in the cour&s;e of many years be the means of preventing the di&s;ea&s;e being received, in a &s;olitary in&s;tance.&mdash; To enforce it under this circum&s;tance, at the ex|pen&s;e of our commerce, is to imitate the conduct of the man, who in attempting to kill a fly upon his child's forehead with a hammer, knocked out its brains.</P>
<P><HI>It has been &s;aid, if we admit the yellow fever to be of domestic origin, it will ruin the credit and com|merce of our city.</HI> The rever&s;e of this opinion is true; for by admitting that it is generated among our&s;elves, we &s;hall &s;oon remove its cau&s;es, where|as, by &s;uppo&s;ing that it may be imported, and act|ing accordingly, we &s;hall naturally be led to ne|glect

the removal of the &s;ources of putrid exhala|tion, and thus after driving our commerce to other ports, we &s;hall entail the di&s;ea&s;e upon future generations. Many of the cities of Europe, and of the We&s;t-Indies, that once generated pe&s;ti|lential di&s;ea&s;es, now enjoy an exemption from them by adopting mea&s;ures for removing their cau&s;|es. The hereditary cleanline&s;s of the Hollanders was impo&s;ed upon them by the di&s;ea&s;es to which their country was formerly &s;ubject from putrid ex|halations.&mdash;The town of Harri&s;burgh in Penn&s;ylva|nia, lo&s;t more of its inhabitants in proportion to their number, than the city of Philadelphia by the yellow fever in 1793. The cau&s;e of this great mortality was traced to a mill dam. It was &s;oon afterwards removed, and the town has ever &s;ince been healthy. It is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence for the cities of the middle and northern &s;tates of America to adopt mea&s;ures of &s;trict and univer&s;al cleanline&s;s, ina&s;much as the di&s;ea&s;e may be taken as often as our inhabitants are expo&s;ed to its &s;ourc|es. In the We&s;t-Indies, the con&s;tant action of the &s;un and of putrid exhalations upon the bodies of the natives and old &s;ettlers, render them for the mo&s;t part, in&s;en&s;ible to any morbid impre&s;&s;ions from them; hence the di&s;ea&s;e is never taken a &s;e|cond time except by per&s;ons who have left the i&s;lands, and after &s;pending two or three years in

a cold climate, have returned to them. New comers are the principal victims of the highe&s;t grade of their bilious fever. The winters in North America, by de&s;troying the habit of in&s;en&s;ibility to heat, and putrid exhalation induced by the previ|ous &s;ummers, place our citizens every year in the condition of new comers in the We&s;t-Indies, or of per&s;ons who have &s;pent two or three years in a cold climate. This circum&s;tance increa&s;es the dan|ger of depopulation to our city from our annual epidemic, and &s;hould produce corre&s;ponding exer|tions to prevent it.</P>

<P N="1">1. Let the docks be immediately cleaned, and let the accumulation of filth in them, be prevent|ed in future, by conveying water into them by a pa&s;&s;age under the wharves, or by paving them with large flag &s;tones inclining in &s;uch a manner towards the channel of the river, as that the filth of the &s;treets &s;hall de&s;cend from them (after it falls into the docks) into the river. This method of paving docks has been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in the city of Bre&s;t. The &s;treet now known by the name of Dock-&s;treet once expo&s;ed a large &s;urface of filth to the action of the &s;un. Its neighbourhood was
<PB N="22" REF="036253_0021_1008A97615700598">
more &s;ickly at that time, than any other part of the city. By means of the pre&s;ent arch over that filth, Dock-&s;treet has been exempted from an un|u&s;ual number of &s;ick people during the &s;ummer and autumnal months.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let every &s;hip that belongs to our port be compelled by law to carry a ventilator. Let all &s;uch &s;hips as are di&s;covered to contain foul air in their holds, be compelled to di&s;charge their cargoes before they reach our city, and let the &s;hips in port, be compelled to pump out their bilge water every day.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Many of the citizens of Philadelphia have de&s;erted the College of Phy&s;icians, by admitting the foul air of a &s;hip to be the cau&s;e of a yellow fever. The College derive it wholly from a <HI>&s;pecific</HI> contagion formed by a peculiar pro|ce&s;s in the body &s;imilar to that which takes place in the &s;mall pox. The foul air produced by putrefaction, whether generated in the hold of a &s;hip, or in docks, or common &s;ewers and gutters, is of the &s;ame nature, and acts in the &s;ame manner in producing the yellow fever.</P>
<P>A new hypothe&s;is has lately been broached to prove the importation of this di&s;ea&s;e. It makes foul air a nece&s;&s;ary <HI>recipient</HI> for the contagion, before it can act upon the body. The &s;mall pox and mea&s;les require no &s;uch recipients to ena|ble them to produce a fever. The foul air is &s;ufficient to induce all the effects that have been a&s;cribed to it, without calling to its aid a mixture with a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pecific conta|gion.</P></NOTE></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="23" REF="036253_0022_1008A979E5E2A390">3. Let the common &s;ewers be wa&s;hed frequent|ly with &s;treams of water from our pumps. Per|haps an advantage would ari&s;e from opening them and removing &s;uch foul matters, as &s;treams of wa|ter are unable to wa&s;h away.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let the gutters be wa&s;hed every evening in warm weather. By frequently wa&s;hing the &s;treets and pavements the heat of the city would be le&s;|&s;ened, and thereby one of the predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es of the fever would in &s;ome mea&s;ure be obviated. The u&s;e of water for the above purpo&s;es, has be|come more nece&s;&s;ary &s;ince the &s;treets and gutters have been &s;o clo&s;ely paved; for the filth which formerly &s;oaked into the earth, is now confined, and emits its noxious vapors into the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P N="5">5. The utmo&s;t care &s;hould be taken to remove the filth from the yards and cellars of every hou&s;e in the city. Hog-&s;tyes &s;hould be forbidden in yards, and the walls of cellars &s;hould be white-wa&s;hed two or three times a year, and their floors &s;hould be con&s;tantly covered with a thin layer of lime.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I attended two per&s;ons in this city la&s;t year in one hou&s;e with the yellow fever, in the yard of which, and di|rectly under the window of the back room was a barrel fill|ed with cucumber and melon rinds, which had been accu|mulated there in the &s;ummer of 1797. The &s;tench from them after a rain, was perceptible all over the hou&s;e.</P><P>Some of the be&s;t hou&s;ekeepers in our city, burn all their offal vegetable and animal matters in their kitchen fires. If this practice were univer&s;al, it would contribute much to the health of our city. Many years ago, hou&s;ekeepers in Am&s;terdam were re&s;trained by law from throwing the offals of their kitchens into their canals. The late increa&s;e of bi|lious fevers in that city has been a&s;cribed to that law not being faithfully carried into execution.</P><P>Fire wood &s;hould never be confined in cellars in the warm months, in a <HI>green,</HI> or <HI>wet</HI> &s;tate.

<P N="6"><PB N="24" REF="036253_0023_1008A97DD34695E8">6. Let the privies be emptied frequently; and let them be con&s;tructed in &s;uch a manner as to prevent their contents from oozing through the earth &s;o as to contaminate the water of the pumps. The fa|mous Ambro&s;e Parey a&s;cribed one of the plagues of Paris wholly to foul air, and impure water. Mr. Latrobe in a note, in his propo&s;al for his pre&s;ent important undertaking, has very properly pointed out the impurity of our water as one of the remote cau&s;es of the yellow fever.&mdash;Happy will it be for the citizens of Philadelphia if by means of that gentleman's plan for &s;upplying the city with river

<P N="7">7. Let all the filth be removed from the neigh|bourhood of the city, and let the brick kiln, and other ponds be filled up, from time to time with the earth which is obtained in digging cellars.</P>
<P N="8">8. In the future improvements of our city, let there be no more dwelling hou&s;es erected in alleys. They are often the &s;ecret receptacles of every kind of filth. The plague always makes its fir&s;t appear|ance in the narrow &s;treets, or in the dirty huts of the &s;uburbs of Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P N="9">9. The predi&s;po&s;ition of our citizens to be affect|ed by the remote and exciting cau&s;es of the yellow fever, would be very much le&s;&s;ened by their living &s;paringly upon fre&s;h animal food and chiefly upon broths and fre&s;h vegetables rendered &s;avoury by &s;pic|es, and a &s;mall quantity of &s;alted meat, during the &s;ummer and autumnal months.

<P>The expen&s;es of removing all the &s;ources of putrid exhalations which have been mentioned, &s;hould not be weighed for a moment with the lo&s;s of three or

To every natural evil, Heaven has provided an antidote, and it is not more certain, that hou&s;es are pre&s;erved from the de&s;truc|tive effects of lightning by metal conductors, than that our cities might be pre&s;erved, under the u&s;ual operation of the laws of nature, from the yellow fever by <HI>cleanline&s;s.</HI> It would &s;eem as if the neglect of it, was nece&s;&s;arily connected with &s;uffering.
