<Q>We frequently fall into error and folly, not becau&s;e the true principles of action are not known, but becau&s;e, for a time, they are not remembered. He may therefore ju&s;tly be numbered among the benefactors of mankind, who contracts the great rules of life into &s;hort &s;entences, that may be ea&s;ily impre&s;&s;ed on the memory, and taught by frequent recollection to recur habitually to the mind.

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;elections of le&s;&s;ons for reading in &s;chools now in u&s;e, are numerous, and many of them contain excellent e&s;&s;ays of various kinds. But in general, tho&s;e e&s;&s;ays are too long, to be read at once; and when they are divided into parts, and read at different times, it is obvious that the connection is entirely broken, and that a great part of the advantages propo&s;ed to be derived from reading are lo&s;t.</P>
<P>To obviate this objection, the volume now offered to the public, is principally compo&s;ed of &s;hort pa&s;&s;ages, each com|plete in it&s;elf, and independent of the re&s;t. When children read in cla&s;&s;es, each may have an entire &s;ubject.</P>
<P>To &s;ome of the extracts, it may perhaps be objected, that they are above the under&s;tanding of youth: But it is believed their capacities are too frequently under-rated; and that it often happens, through &s;uch a pernicious mi&s;take, that they &s;pend their time in reading idle tales and &s;tories, when they might be employed in trea&s;uring up a &s;tore of u&s;eful maxims to guide them through the thorny path of life with &s;afety and honour to them&s;elves and advantage to the community.</P>
<P>In making the &s;election, con&s;iderable pains have been taken. Many of the works of the mo&s;t celebrated writers have been carefully examined&mdash;and numerous pa&s;&s;ages adorn the work from Shake&s;peare, Dryden, Milton, Pope, Young, Watts, Rowe, Addi&s;on, Swift, Brooke, Fielding, Hervey, John&s;on, Price, Monte&s;quieu and others of equal reputation. To familiarize the ri&s;ing generation with the peru&s;al of &s;uch illu&s;trious writers, can hardly fail to prove &s;alutary.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="037099_0003_100C4BE7B1E8B3F0">
The introduction of political &s;entiments into a work intended principally for youth, will probably be cen&s;ured by &s;ome per&s;ons. It may not therefore be improper to offer the rea&s;ons that led to the adoption of this plan.</P>
<P>In countries where the e&s;tabli&s;hed form of government is monarchy, mo&s;t of the elementary books u&s;ed to in&s;truct children in their native language, are calculated to impre&s;s on their youthful minds, a prejudice in favour of the ex|i&s;ting order of things. National glory, (which means the &s;preading havoc and de&s;truction among other nations), the &s;plendor of monarchy, and the advantages of conque&s;t, are di&s;played in the mo&s;t captivating and glowing colours. <HI>This system is the result of profound policy.</HI> An early bias is thus given to the mind, which in mo&s;t ca&s;es "grows with its growth," and often retains its influence to the la&s;t &s;tage of decrepitude.</P>
<P>And is not &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem at lea&s;t as proper and nece&s;&s;ary in this country as el&s;ewhere? Should not endeavours be u&s;ed to impre&s;s on the ri&s;ing generation, a re&s;pect and reverence for the forms of government under which we live? Our con&s;titutions are all grounded on the rights of the citizens to liberty and the &s;ecurity of property, and on the grand principle, that the officers of government, legi&s;|lative as well as executive, are all the agents of the people, deputed to perform for them tho&s;e functions which they cannot execute them&s;elves. In every one of them are recogni&s;ed tho&s;e grand and &s;ublime truths, the defence of which has rendered &s;o many men illu&s;trious in the Engli&s;h annals&mdash;tho&s;e principles for which
<Q><L>a Hampden &s;truggled, and a Sydney bled&mdash;</L></Q>
tho&s;e principles, in fine, which are to be found in a greater or le&s;s degree, through the writings of the be&s;t men of all ages and nations.</P>
<P>On this ground, it is pre&s;umed that va&s;t advantages mu&s;t accrue from &s;ubjecting to the peru&s;al of youth, &s;uch a variety of elegant pa&s;&s;ages, tending to &s;hew in the &s;tronge&s;t light the advantages of liberty, of peace, of good order&mdash;the dignity of human nature&mdash;to in&s;pire an abhorrence of war&mdash;and to di&s;play its tremendous con&s;equences, in all
<PB N="iv" REF="037099_0004_100C4BEAD26CF6F8">
their native deformity, &s;tripped of the impo&s;ing glo&s;s which artful and intere&s;ted men have &s;pread over them.</P>
<P>The names of the writers are generally given, partly as a tribute of gratitude towards tho&s;e who&s;e writings have &s;erved to complete this work&mdash;partly to facilitate a compari&s;on between the &s;entiments of men in different ages&mdash;and partly with a view of exciting the reader's curio&s;ity to &s;earch into their works complete. It is not pretended that a &s;ublime truth can receive any corrobo|ration from the celebrity of the man who wrote it. The &s;entiment, that
<Q><L>The pure&s;t trea&s;ure mortal times afford,</L>
<L>Is &s;potle&s;s reputation. That away,</L>
<L>Men are but gilded loam or painted clay,</L></Q>
is an eternal axiom, and, whether &s;anctioned with the name of a Shake&s;peare or a Dennis, mu&s;t carry conviction to every correct mind. In like manner, the po&s;ition in page 240,&mdash;<Q>No man is better born than another, unle&s;s he is born with better abilities, and a more amiable di&s;po|&s;ition,</Q> needs not the prop of Seneca's name to com|mand a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>With the&s;e few remarks this &s;mall work is &s;ubmitted to the candour and indulgence of the public, who&s;e deci|&s;ion on its utility &s;hall be acquie&s;ced in by the editor. He may have e&s;timated too high the probable beneficial effects of his labours. This is &s;o common an error as to be perhaps a venial one. But whatever may be its tendency or its &s;ucce&s;s, he can never be deprived of the &s;olid &s;atis|faction ari&s;ing from a perfect con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having u&s;ed his mo&s;t earne&s;t endeavours to promote the be&s;t intere&s;ts of his fellow men.</P>

<HEAD>OF ELOCUTION.</HEAD>
<P>ELOCUTION is a branch of oratory, the pow|er and importance of which is greater than is generally thought; in&s;omuch that eloquence takes its name from it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eloquentia ab eloqui. I u&s;e the word Elocution here in its common and vulgar &s;en&s;e, to &s;ignify utterance, delivery, or pronunciation, in which &s;en&s;e we frequently u&s;e it in the Engli&s;h language, and which its Latin etymology very well ju&s;tifies; tho' I know &s;ome good writers apply to it a different idea, in conformity to the &s;en&s;e in which the Latin orators u&s;ed the word elocutio. But it is no uncommon thing for derivative words in one language to be taken in a different &s;en&s;e from that, in which the words they are derived from are taken in another.</NOTE></P>
<P>It was much cultivated by Quintilian, and before him by Cicero, and before him by M. Antonius; but before his time, it was too much neglected by the Roman orators: Which made him &s;ay, "he had &s;een many men famous for eloquence, but not one of them that under&s;tood elocution."</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037099_0014_100C4C006B2092B8">
But what &s;tre&s;s was laid upon it by the Greek orators, appears from that celebrated &s;aying of Demo&s;|thenes; who being a&s;ked, what was the fir&s;t principal thing in oratory? an&s;wered, Pronunciation; being a&s;ked again, what was the &s;econd? replied, Pronunci|ation. And what was the third? Pronunciation. Denoting that in his judgment the whole art, &s;pirit, and power of oratory con&s;i&s;ted in this.</P>
<P>Cicero, and after him Quintilian, divided oratory into five parts: 1. Invention&mdash;by which we pro|vide our&s;elves with &s;uitable and &s;ufficient materials for a di&s;cour&s;e. 2. Di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;by which they meant the divi&s;ion of their &s;ubject into parts and &s;entences, according to the mo&s;t natural order; and con&s;equently the proper di&s;tribution and arrangement of their ideas. 3. Elocution&mdash;by which they always meant, what we call Diction; which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;uiting our words to our ideas, and the &s;tyle to the &s;ubject. 4. Memory, or a faculty of clearly di&s;cerning and retaining our ideas, and of calling to mind the propere&s;t words by which to expre&s;s them. 5. Pronunciation; or the art of ma|naging the voice and ge&s;ture in &s;peaking.</P>
<P>So that by pronunciation, the antients under&s;tood both Elocution and Action; and comprehended in it the right management of the voice, looks, and ge&s;ture. To the former of the&s;e, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the right management of the voice in reading or &s;peaking; which is indifferently called by us, Elocution and Pronunciation, I &s;hall here confine my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The great de&s;ign and end of a good pronunciation is, to make the ideas &s;eem to come from the heart; and then they will not fail to excite the attention and affections of tho&s;e that hear us: from which the great benefit and u&s;efulne&s;s of this too much neglected art may be &s;een.</P>

<PB N="7" REF="037099_0015_100C4C050EEF5958">
<HEAD>OF BAD PRONUNCIATION.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;everal faults of pronunciation are the&s;e following:</P>
<P N="1">1. When the voice is too loud.</P>
<P>This is very di&s;agreeable to the hearer, and very in|convenient to the &s;peaker.</P>
<P>It will be very di&s;agreeable to the hearers, if they be per&s;ons of good ta&s;te: who will always look upon it to be the effect either of ignorance or affectation.</P>
<P>Some will impute it to your ignorance, and &s;uppo&s;e that you were never in&s;tructed better &s;ince you left the reading &s;chool; where children generally get a habit of reading in a high-pitched key, or a uniform elevated voice, without any regard to empha&s;is, cadence, or a graceful elocution.</P>
<P>Others will impute it to affectation; or a de&s;ign to work upon their pa&s;&s;ions; which will immediately de|feat the de&s;ign, if you had it. For if you would effec|tually move the pa&s;&s;ions, you mu&s;t carefully conceal your intention &s;o to do; for as &s;oon as the mind perceives you have &s;uch a de&s;ign upon it, it will be u|pon its guard. However, none but the mo&s;t low, weak, and mechanical minds will be affected with mere dint of &s;ound and noi&s;e. And the pa&s;&s;ions &s;o rai&s;ed, leave no la&s;ting or valuable effects upon the mind, and an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e or end; becau&s;e the under&s;tanding hath nothing to do with &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions, and the memory no handle by which to retain or recall them. Not to &s;ay, it often an&s;wers a bad end; affects the mind in a wrong place, and gives it a fal&s;e bias. However this may be thought to become the &s;tage or the bar, it lea&s;t of all befits the pulpit; where all ought to be &s;olemn, &s;erious, rational, and grave as the &s;ubjects there treated of.</P>
<P>It is fal&s;e oratory then to &s;eek to per&s;uade or affect by mere vehemence of voice. A thing that hath been often attempted by men of mean furniture, low genius,
<PB N="8" REF="037099_0016_100C4C0708B2B710">
or bad ta&s;te, among the antients as well as the moderns. A practice which formerly gave the judicious Quin|tilian great offence; who calls it not only clamouring, but furious bellowing; not vehemence, but downright violence.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, an over&s;trained voice is very inconvenient to the &s;peaker, as well as di&s;gu&s;tful to judicious hearers. It exhau&s;ts his &s;pirits to no purpo&s;e; and takes from him the proper management and modulation of his voice according to the &s;en&s;e of his &s;ubject; and, what is wor&s;t of all, it naturally leads him into a tone.</P>
<P>Every man's voice indeed &s;hould fill the place where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eaks; but if it exceed its natural key, it will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;weet nor &s;oft, nor agreeable, becau&s;e he will not be able to give every word its proper and di&s;tin|gui&s;hing &s;ound.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another fault in pronunciation is when the voice is too low.</P>
<P>This is not &s;o inconvenient to the &s;peaker, but is as di&s;agreeable to the hearer, as the other extreme. And inde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to the generality of hearers a too low voice is much more di&s;plea&s;ing than a too loud one; e&s;pe|cially to tho&s;e who are troubled with an impediment in hearing, and tho&s;e who are be&s;t plea&s;ed with a lively and pathetic addre&s;s, as mo&s;t are. It is always offen&s;ive to an audience to ob&s;erve any thing in the reader or &s;peaker that looks like indolence or inatten|tion. The hearer will never be affected whil&s;t he &s;ees the &s;peaker indifferent.</P>
<P>The art of governing the voice con&s;i&s;ts a good deal in dexterou&s;ly avoiding the&s;e two extremes: at lea&s;t, this ought to be fir&s;t minded. And for a general rule to direct you herein, I know of none better than this&mdash;carefully to pre&s;erve the key, that is, the command of your voice; and at the &s;ame time, to adapt the eleva|tion and &s;trength of it to the condition and number of the per&s;ons you &s;peak to, and the nature of the place you &s;peak in.&mdash;It would be altogether as ridiculous in
<PB N="9" REF="037099_0017_100C32916CA8F3F0">
a general who is haranguing an army to &s;peak in a low and languid voice, as in a per&s;on who reads a chapter in a family to &s;peak in a loud and eager one.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another fault in pronunciation is a thick, ha&s;ty, cluttering voice.</P>
<P>This is, when a per&s;on mumbles, or clips, or &s;wal|lows his words, that is, leaves out &s;ome &s;yllables in the long words, and never pronounces &s;ome of the &s;hort ones at all; but hurries on without any care to be heard di&s;tinctly, or to give his words their full &s;ound, or his hearers the full &s;en&s;e of them.</P>
<P>This is often owing to a defect in the organs of &s;peech, or a too great flutter of the animal &s;pirits; but oftener to a bad habit uncorrected.</P>
<P>Demo&s;thenes, the greate&s;t orator Greece ever produ|ced, had, it is &s;aid, neverthele&s;s, three natural impedi|ments in pronunciation; all which he conquered by invincible labour and per&s;everance. One was a weakne&s;s of voice; which he cured by frequently declaiming on the &s;ea-&s;hore, amid&s;t the noi&s;e of the waves. Another was a &s;hortne&s;s of breath; which he mended by repeating his orations as he walked up a hill. And the other was the fault I am &s;peaking of; a thick mumbling way of &s;peaking; which he broke him&s;elf of by declaiming with pebbles in his mouth.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another fault in pronunciation is when per&s;ons &s;peak too quick.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce any fault more common than this, e&s;pecially among young per&s;ons, who imagine they can read very well, and are not afraid of being &s;topped in their carreer by the unexpected intervention of any hard word. And &s;carce any bad habit of the voice is con|quered with more difficulty; tho' one would imagine nothing is more ea&s;y.</P>
<P>This manner of reading may do well enough when we are examining lea&s;es; peru&s;ing indentures; or reciting acts of parliament, where there is always a
<PB N="10" REF="037099_0018_100C4C0C6A044D48">
great &s;uperfluity of words; or in reading a new&s;paper, where there is but little matter that de&s;erves our atten|tion; but is very improper in reading books of devo|tion and in&s;truction, and e&s;pecially the &s;acred &s;criptures, where the &s;olemnity of the &s;ubject or the weight of the &s;en&s;e demands a particular regard. But it is mo&s;t of all inexcu&s;able to read forms of prayer in this manner as acts of devotion.</P>
<P>The great di&s;advantage which attends this manner of pronunciation, is, that the hearer lo&s;es the benefit of more than half the good things he hears, and would fain remember, but cannot. And a &s;peaker &s;hould al|ways have a regard to the memory, as well as the under|&s;tanding, of his hearers.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is al&s;o a fault to &s;peak too &s;low.</P>
<P>Some are apt to read in a heavy, droning, &s;leepy way; and through mere carele&s;&s;ne&s;s make pau&s;es at improper places. This is very di&s;agreeable. But to hem, hauk, &s;neeze, yawn, or cough, between the pe|riods, is va&s;tly more &s;o.</P>
<P>A too &s;low elocution is mo&s;t faulty in reading trifles that do not require attention. It then becomes tedious. A per&s;on that is addicted to this &s;low way of &s;peaking &s;hould always take care to reward the hearer's patience with importan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;entiments, and compen&s;ate the want of words by a weight of thoughts; and give his di&s;cour&s;e its proper quantity of &s;olid &s;en&s;e, that, as we &s;ay, what it wants in length it may make out in breadth.</P>
<P>But a too &s;low elocution is a fault very rarely to be found, unle&s;s in aged people, and tho&s;e who naturally &s;peak &s;o in common conver&s;ation. And in the&s;e, if the pronunciation be in all other re&s;pects ju&s;t, decent, and proper; and e&s;pecially if the &s;ubject be weighty or intricate, it is very excu&s;able.</P>
<P N="6">6. An irregular or uneven voice, is a great fault in reading.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037099_0019_100C4C0EB51BCF58">
That is, when the voice ri&s;es and falls by fits and &s;tarts, or when it is elevated and depre&s;&s;ed unnaturally, or un&s;ea&s;onably, without regard to &s;en&s;e or &s;tops; or always beginning a &s;entence with a high voice, and concluding it with a low one, or <HI>vice versa;</HI> or always beginning and concluding it with the &s;ame key. Oppo&s;ite to this is.</P>
<P N="7">7. A flat, dull, uniform tone of voice, without empha&s;is or cadence, or any regard to the &s;en&s;e or &s;ub|ject of what is read.</P>
<P>This is a habit, which children who have been u&s;ed to read their le&s;&s;ons by way of ta&s;k, are very apt to fall into, and retain as they grow up, &s;uch a monotony as attorney's clerks read in, when they examine an en|gro&s;&s;ed deed. This is a great infelicity when it becomes habitual; becau&s;e it deprives the hearer of the greate&s;t part of the benefit or advantage he might receive by a clo&s;e attention to the mo&s;t weighty and intere&s;ting parts of the &s;ubject, which &s;hould always be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed or pointed out by the pronunciation&mdash;For a ju&s;t pronunciation is a good commentary.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t common fault of all is reading with a tone.</P>
<P>No habit is more ea&s;y to be contracted than this, or more hard to be conquered. This unnatural tone in reading and &s;peaking is very various; but whatever it be, it is always di&s;gu&s;tful to per&s;ons of delicacy and judgment.</P>
<P>Some have a womani&s;h &s;queaking tone; which, per&s;ons who&s;e voices are &s;hrill and weak, and over|&s;trained, are very apt to fall into.</P>
<P>Some have a &s;inging or canting tone, which En|thu&s;ia&s;tic &s;peakers generally much affect, and by which their hearers are often much affected. Others affect a high, &s;welling, theatrical tone; who being ambiti|ous of the fame of fine orators, lay too much empha&s;is on every &s;entence, and thereby tran&s;gre&s;s the rules of true oratory.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037099_0020_100C4C109E5307F0">
Others affect an awful and &s;triking tone, attended with &s;olemn grimace, as if they would move you with every word, whether the weight of the &s;ubject bear them out or not. This is what per&s;ons of a gloomy or melancholy ca&s;t of mind are mo&s;t apt to give into.</P>
<P>Some have a &s;et uniform tone of voice; which I have already taken notice of.&mdash;Others, an odd, whim&s;ical, whining tone, peculiar to them&s;elves, and not to be de&s;cribed&mdash;only that it is laying the empha&s;is on words which do not require or de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged, there are &s;ome kinds of tone which, though unnatural, yet, as managed by the &s;peakers, are not very di&s;agreeable&mdash;and the mind mu&s;t be much on its guard that can remain unmoved thereby.</P>
<P>When I have been affected with hearing orators de|liver common or ob&s;cure &s;entiments in &s;uch a &s;triking tone, I have endeavoured carefully to examine into the true rea&s;on of that emotion, or what it was that excited that affection in my mind; and have found that it could not ari&s;e from the mere tone of the &s;peaker&mdash;which of it&s;elf was unnatural and di&s;agreeable&mdash;nor from the weight of the &s;ubject&mdash;which was no more than common&mdash;but from the earne&s;tne&s;s, life and &s;o|lemnity with which he &s;pake, and his appearing him|&s;elf to be much affected with what he delivered; which two things will never fail to move an audience. And why they may not be as well ob&s;erved and prac|ti&s;ed without a tone as with one, I cannot conceive. And without the&s;e a tone it&s;elf would have no power to move; as it hath no other &s;ub&s;erviency to rai&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions than as it &s;olemnizes the &s;ubject, and &s;eems to &s;hew the &s;peaker's heart engaged. Pity that tho&s;e two ends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not be an&s;wered by a better means! and that a bad habit in the &s;peaker, indulging a fal&s;e ta&s;te in the hearers, &s;hould &s;ecure one great end of ora|tory by that which is the greate&s;t abu&s;e of it!</P>

<HEAD>HOW TO AVOID A BAD PRONUNCIATION.</HEAD>
<P>To this end the few following rules may be of &s;er|vice.</P>
<P N="1">1. If you would not read in too loud or too low a voice, con&s;ider whether your voice be naturally too low or loud; and correct it accordingly in your ordi|nary conver&s;ation: by which means you will be better able to correct it in reading. If it be too low, con|ver&s;e with tho&s;e that are deaf; if too loud, with tho&s;e who&s;e voices are low. Begin your periods with an even moderate voice, that you may have the command of it, to rai&s;e or fall it as the &s;ubject requires.</P>
<P N="2">2. To cure a thick confu&s;ed cluttering voice, accu&s;|tom your&s;elf, both in conver&s;ation and reading, to pro|nounce every word di&s;tinct and clear. Ob&s;erve with what delib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ration &s;ome conver&s;e and read, and how full a &s;ound they give to every word; and imitate them. Do not affect to contract your words, as &s;ome do, or run two into one. This may do very well in conver&s;ation, or in reading familiar dialogues, but is not &s;o decent in grave and &s;olemn &s;ubjects; e&s;pecially in reading the &s;acred &s;criptures.</P>
<P>It appears from Demo&s;thenes's ca&s;e, that this fault of pronunciation cannot be cured without much diffi|culty, nor will you find his remedy effectual without pains and per&s;everance.</P>
<P N="3">3. To break a habit of reading too fa&s;t, attend dili|gently to the &s;en&s;e, weight, and propriety of every &s;en|tence you read, and of every emphatical word in it. This will not only be an advantage to your&s;elf, but a double one to your hearers; for it will at once give them time to do the &s;ame, and excite their attention when they &s;ee yours is fixed. A &s;olemn pau&s;e after a weighty thought is very beautiful and &s;triking. A well timed &s;top gives as much grace to &s;peech as it does to mu&s;ic. Imagine that you are &s;peaking to per&s;ons of
<PB N="14" REF="037099_0022_100C4C1556A35960">
&s;low and unready conceptions; and mea&s;ure not your hearer's apprehen&s;ion by your own. If you do, you may po&s;&s;ibly out-run it. And as in reading you are not at liberty to repeat your words and &s;entences, that &s;hould engage you to be very deliberate in pronouncing them, that their &s;en&s;e may not be lo&s;t. The ea&s;e and advantage that will ari&s;e both to the &s;peaker and hear|er, by a free, full, and deliberate pronunciation is hard|ly to be imagined.</P>
<P>I need lay down no rules to avoid a too &s;low pro|nunciation; that being a fault which few are guilty of.</P>
<P N="4">4. To cure an uneven, de&s;ultory voice, take care that you do not begin your periods either in too high or too low a key; for that will nece&s;&s;arily lead you to an unnatural and improper variation of it. Have a careful regard to the nature and quantity of your points, and the length of your periods; and keep your mind intent on the &s;en&s;e, &s;ubject, and &s;pirit of your author.</P>
<P>The &s;ame directions are nece&s;&s;ary to avoid a mon|otony in pronunciation, or a dull, &s;et, uniform tone of voice. For if your mind be but attentive to the &s;en&s;e of your &s;ubject, you will naturally manage and mod|ulate your voice according to the nature and importance of it.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, To avoid all kinds of unnatural and di&s;a|greeable tones, the only rule is to endeavour to &s;peak with the &s;ame ea&s;e and freedom as you would do on the &s;ame &s;ubject in private conver&s;ation. You hear no body conver&s;e in a tone; unle&s;s they have the uncouth accent of &s;ome other country, or have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into a habit of altering the natural key of their voice when they are talking of &s;ome &s;erious &s;ubject in religion. But I can &s;ee no rea&s;on in the world, that when in common conver&s;ation we &s;peak in a natural voice with proper ac|cent and empha&s;is, yet as &s;oon as we begin to read, or talk of religion, or &s;peak in public, we &s;hould imme|diately a&s;&s;ume a &s;tiff, aukward, unnatural tone. If we are indeed deeply affected with the &s;ubject we read
<PB N="15" REF="037099_0023_100C4C16DA6D9C18">
or talk of, the voice will naturally vary according to the pa&s;&s;ion excited; but if we vary it unnaturally, only to &s;eem affected, or with a de&s;ign to affect others, it then becomes a tone, and is offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>In reading then attend to your &s;ubject, and deliver it ju&s;t in &s;uch a manner as you would do if you were talking of it. This is the great, general and mo&s;t im|portant rule of all; which, if carefully ob&s;erved, will correct not only this but almo&s;t all the other faults of a bad pronunciation; and give you an ea&s;y, decent, graceful delivery, agreeable to all the rules of a right elocution. For however apt we are to tran&s;gre&s;s them in reading, we follow them naturally and ea&s;ily enough in conver&s;ation. And children will tell a &s;tory with all the natural graces and beauties of pronunciation, however aukwardly they may read the &s;ame out of a book.</P>

<HEAD>OF GOOD PRONUNCIATION.</HEAD>
<P>A good pronunciation in reading, is the art of managing and governing the voice &s;o as to expre&s;s the full &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of your author in that ju&s;t, decent and graceful manner, which will not only in&s;truct but affect the hearers; and will not only rai&s;e in them the &s;ame ideas he intended to convey, but the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions he really felt. This is the great end of reading to others, and this end can only be attained by a proper and ju&s;t pronunciation.</P>
<P>And hence we may learn wherein a good pronunci|ation in &s;peaking con&s;i&s;ts; which is nothing but a natural, ea&s;y, and graceful variation of the voice, &s;uitable to the nature and importance of the &s;entiments we deliver.</P>
<P>A good pronunciation in both the&s;e re&s;pects is more ea&s;ily attained by &s;ome than others; as &s;ome can more readily enter into the &s;en&s;e and &s;entiments of an author, and more ea&s;ily deliver their own, than others can;

and at the &s;ame time have a more happy facility of expre&s;&s;ing all the proper variations and modulations of the voice than others have. Thus per&s;ons of a quick apprehen&s;ion, and a bri&s;k flow of animal &s;pirits (&s;etting a&s;ide all impediments of the organs) have generally a more lively, ju&s;t, and natural elocution than per&s;ons of a &s;low perception and a flegmatic ca&s;t.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="lesson">
<HEAD>OF PAUSES.</HEAD>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to pau&s;es, you will in a great mea&s;ure in reading be directed by the common &s;tops or points, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Comma (,)&mdash;Semi-colon (;)&mdash;Colon (:)&mdash;Period (.)&mdash;Interrogation (?)&mdash;and Admiration (!).</P>
<P>The&s;e points &s;erve two purpo&s;es&mdash;to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;en&s;e of the author, and&mdash;to direct the pronunciation of the reader.&mdash;A comma &s;tops the voice, while we may privately tell one&mdash;a &s;emi-colon, two&mdash;a colon, three&mdash;and a period, four.</P>
<P>To break a habit of taking breath too often in read|ing, accu&s;tom your&s;elf to read long periods, &s;uch as the &s;ixteen fir&s;t lines in Milton's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</P>
<P>After &s;ome weighty and important &s;entiment, it will be proper to make a longer pau&s;e than ordinary; and e&s;pecially towards the clo&s;e or application of a di&s;cour&s;e:

&mdash;the&s;e long pau&s;es are very proper; as they at once compo&s;e and affect the mind, and give it time to think.

<DIV2 TYPE="lesson">
<HEAD>OF EMPHASIS.</HEAD>
<P>THE next thing to be regarded in reading is the Empha&s;is; and to &s;ee that it be always laid on the emphatical word.</P>
<P>When we di&s;tingui&s;h any particular &s;yllable in a word with a &s;trong voice, it is called Accent; when we thus di&s;tingui&s;h any particular word in a &s;entence, it is called Empha&s;is; and the word to di&s;tingui&s;hed the Emphatical word. And the emphatical words (for there are often more than one) in a &s;entence, are tho&s;e which carry a weight or importance in them&s;elves, or tho&s;e on which the &s;en&s;e of the re&s;t depends; and the&s;e mu&s;t always be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a fuller and &s;tronger &s;ound of voice, wherever they are found, whether in the beginning, middle, or end of a &s;entence. Take for in&s;tance tho&s;e words of the &s;atiri&s;t.
<Q><L>Get pl&agrave;ce and we&agrave;lth, if po&s;&s;ible, with gr&agrave;ce,</L>
<L>If not, by &agrave;ny means get we&agrave;lth and pl&agrave;ce.</L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q>
In the&s;e lines the emphatical words are accented; and which they are, the &s;en&s;e will always di&s;cover.</P>
<P>Some &s;entences are &s;o full and comprehen&s;ive, that almo&s;t every word is emphatical: For in&s;tance, that pathetic expo&s;tulation in the prophecy of Ezekiel,
<Q>Why will ye die!</Q>
In this &s;hort &s;entence, every word is emphatical, and on which ever word you lay the empha&s;is, whether the
<PB N="18" REF="037099_0026_100C4C1E6BBE4DA0">
fir&s;t, &s;econd, third, or fourth, it &s;trikes out a different &s;en&s;e, and opens a new &s;ubject of moving expo&s;tulation.</P>
<P>Some &s;entences are equivocal, as well as &s;ome words; that is, contain in them more &s;en&s;es than one; and which is the &s;en&s;e intended can only be known by ob&s;erving on what word the empha&s;is is laid. For in&s;tance&mdash;"Will you ride to town to-day?"&mdash;This que&s;tion is capable of being taken in four different &s;en|&s;es, according to the different words on which you lay the empha&s;is. If it be laid on the word <HI>you,</HI>&mdash;the an&s;wer may be&mdash;"No, but I intend to &s;end my &s;ervant in my &s;tead."&mdash;If the empha&s;is be laid on the word <HI>ride</HI>&mdash;the proper an&s;wer might be&mdash;"No, I intend to walk it."&mdash;If you place the empha&s;is on the word <HI>town</HI>&mdash;it is a different que&s;tion; and the an&s;wer may be&mdash;"No, for I de&s;ign to ride into the country"&mdash;And if the empha&s;is be laid upon the words <HI>to-day</HI>&mdash;the &s;en&s;e is &s;till &s;omething different from all the&s;e; and the proper an&s;wer may be&mdash;"No, but I &s;hall to-morrow"&mdash;Of &s;uch importance oftentimes is a right empha&s;is, in order to determine the proper &s;en&s;e of what we read or &s;peak.</P>
<P>The voice mu&s;t al&s;o expre&s;s, as near as may be, the very &s;en&s;e or idea de&s;igned to be conveyed by the em|phatical word; by a &s;trong, rough, and violent, or a &s;oft, &s;mooth, and tender &s;ound.</P>
<P>Thus the different pa&s;&s;ions of the mind are to be expre&s;&s;ed by a different &s;ound or tone of voice. Love, by a &s;oft, &s;mooth, langui&s;hing voice;&mdash;Anger, by a &s;trong, vehement, and elevated voice;&mdash;Joy, by a quick, &s;weet, and clear voice;&mdash;Sorrow, by a low, flexible, inter|rupted voice;&mdash;Fear, by a dejected, tremulous, he&s;ita|ting voice;&mdash;Courage hath a full, bold, and loud voice;&mdash;and Perplexity, a grave, &s;teady, and earne&s;t one. In Exordiums the voice &s;hould be low;&mdash;in Narrations, di&s;tinct;&mdash;in Rea&s;oning, &s;low;&mdash;in Per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;trong; it &s;hould thunder in Anger&mdash;&s;often in Sorrow&mdash;trem|ble in Fear&mdash;and melt in Love.</P>

The variation of the empha&s;is mu&s;t not only di&s;tin|gui&s;h the various pa&s;&s;ions de&s;cribed, but the &s;everal forms and figures of &s;peech in which they are expre&s;&s;ed.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="lesson">
<HEAD>OF CADENCE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is directly oppo&s;ite to empha&s;is. Empha&s;is is rai&s;ing the voice, cadence is falling it; and when right|ly managed is very mu&s;ical. Be&s;ide cadence of voice, there is cadence of &s;tile&mdash;That is, when the &s;en&s;e being almo&s;t expre&s;&s;ed and perfectly di&s;cerned by the reader, the remaining words, which are only nece&s;&s;ary to com|plete the period, gently fall of them&s;elves, without any emphatical word among them. If our author's lan|guage be pure and elegant, his cadence of &s;tile will naturally direct the cadence of voice.</P>
<P>Cadence generally takes place at the end of a &s;en|tence; unle&s;s it clo&s;es with an emphatical word.</P>
<P>Every parenthe&s;is is to be pronounced in cadence; that is, with a low voice, and quicker than ordinary; that it may not take off the attention too much from the &s;en&s;e of the period it interrupts. But all apo&s;trophes and pro&s;opopaeias are to be pronounced in empha&s;is.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IF you would acquire a ju&s;t pronunciation in read|ing, you mu&s;t not only take in the full &s;en&s;e, but enter into the &s;pirit of your author: For you can never convey the force and fulne&s;s of his ideas to another, till you feel them your&s;elf. No man can read an author he does not perfectly under&s;tand and ta&s;te.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The great rule which the ma&s;ters of rhetoric &s;o much pre&s;s, can never enough be remembered; that to make a man &s;peak well, and pronounce with a right empha&s;is, he ought thoroughly to under&s;tand all that he &s;ays, be fully per&s;uaded of it, and bring him&s;elf to have tho&s;e affections which he de&s;ires to infu&s;e into others. He that is inwardly per&s;uaded of the truth of what he &s;ays, and that hath a concern about it in his mind, will pronounce with a natural vehemence that is far more lovely than all the &s;trains that art can lead him to. An orator mu&s;t endeavor to feel what he &s;ays, and then he will &s;peak &s;o as to make others feel it.</NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;ame rules are to be ob&s;erved in reading poetry and pro&s;e: Neither the rhyme nor the numbers &s;hould take off the attention from the &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of the author. It is this only that mu&s;t direct the pronunci|ation in poetry as well as pro&s;e. When you read ver&s;e, you mu&s;t not at all favor the mea&s;ure or rhyme; <HI>that</HI> often ob&s;cures the &s;en&s;e and &s;poils the pronunciation: For the great end of pronunciation is to elucidate and heighten the &s;en&s;e; that is, to repre&s;ent it not only in a clear, but a &s;trong light. Whatever then ob&s;tructs this is carefully to be avoided, both in ver&s;e and pro&s;e. Nay, this ought to be more carefully ob&s;erved in read|ing ver&s;e than pro&s;e; becau&s;e the author, by a con&s;tant attention to his mea&s;ure and rhyme, and the exaltation of his language, is often very apt to ob&s;cure his &s;en&s;e; which therefore requires the more care in the reader to di&s;cover and di&s;tingui&s;h it by the pronunciation. And if when you read ver&s;e with proper pau&s;e, empha&s;is, and cadence, and a pronunciation varied and governed
<PB N="21" REF="037099_0029_100C4C24EB343228">
by the &s;en&s;e, it be not harmonious and beautiful, the fault is not in the reader but the author. And if the ver&s;e be good, to read it thus will improve its harmony; becau&s;e it will take off that uniformity of &s;ound and accent which tires the ear, and makes the numbers heavy and di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>Another important rule to be ob&s;erved in elocution is&mdash;&s;tudy Nature.&mdash;By this I mean your own natural di&s;po&s;itions and affections. And tho&s;e &s;ubjects that are mo&s;t &s;uitable to them, you will ea&s;ily pronounce with a beautiful propriety: and to heighten the pronuncia|tion, the natural warmth of the mind &s;hould be per|mitted to have its cour&s;e under a proper rein and regulation.</P>
<P>Study the natural di&s;po&s;itions and affections of others. For &s;ome are much more ea&s;ily impre&s;&s;ed and moved one way, and &s;ome another. And an orator &s;hould be acquainted with all the avenues to the heart.</P>
<P>Study the mo&s;t ea&s;y and natural way of expre&s;&s;ing your&s;elf, both as to the tone of voice and the mode of &s;peech. And this is be&s;t learned by ob&s;ervations on common conver&s;ation&mdash;where all is free, natural, and ea&s;y&mdash;where we are only intent on making our&s;elves under&s;tood, and conveying our ideas in a &s;trong, plain, and lively manner, by the mo&s;t natural language, pronunciation and action. And the nearer our pro|nunciation in public comes to the freedom and ea&s;e of that we u&s;e in common di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;provided we keep up the dignity of the &s;ubject, and pre&s;erve a propriety of expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;the more ju&s;t, natural, and agreeable it will generally be.</P>
<P>Above all things, then, &s;tudy nature&mdash;avoid affecta|tion&mdash;never u&s;e art, if you have not the art to conceal it. For whatever does not appear natural, can never be agreeable, much le&s;s per&s;ua&s;ive.</P>
<P>Endeavor to keep your mind collected and compo|&s;ed&mdash;Guard again&s;t that flatter and timidity of &s;pirit,
<PB N="22" REF="037099_0030_100C4C285EFD6920">
which is the common infelicity of young, and e&s;pecially ba&s;hful per&s;ons, when they fir&s;t begin to &s;peak or read in public. This is a great hindrance both to their pronunciation and invention; and at once gives both them&s;elves and their hearers an unnece&s;&s;ary pain. It will by con&s;tant oppo&s;ition wear off&mdash;and the be&s;t way to give the mind a proper degree of a&s;&s;urance and &s;elf-command at &s;uch a time, is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e entire ma&s;ter of the &s;ubject&mdash;and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that you deliver to your audience nothing but what is well worth their hearing, will give you a &s;trong degree of courage.</P>
<P>Endeavor to be wholly engaged in your &s;ubject; and when the mind is intent upon and warmed with it, it will forget that awful deference it before paid to the audience, which was &s;o apt to di&s;concert it.</P>
<P>If the &s;ight of your hearers, or any of them di&s;com|po&s;e you, keep your eyes from them.</P>
<P>Be &s;ure to keep up a life, &s;pirit, and energy in the expre&s;&s;ion; and let the voice naturally vary according to the variation of the &s;tile and &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Whatever be the &s;ubject, it will never be plea&s;ing, if the &s;tyle be low and flat; nor will the beauty of the &s;tyle be di&s;covered, if the pronunciation be &s;o.</P>
<P>Cicero ob&s;erves there mu&s;t be a glow in our &s;tyle if we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> warm our hearers. And who does not ob|&s;erve how ridiculous it is to pronounce the <HI>ardens verbum</HI> in a cold lifele&s;s tone?&mdash;The tran&s;ition of the voice mu&s;t always corre&s;pond with that of the &s;ubject, and the pa&s;&s;ions it was intended to excite.</P>
<P>To attain a ju&s;t and graceful pronunciation, you &s;hould accu&s;tom your&s;elves frequently to hear tho&s;e who excel in it, whether at the bar or in the pulpit&mdash;where you will &s;ee all the &s;ore-mentioned rules exem|plified, and be able to account for all tho&s;e graces and beauties of pronunciation which always plea&s;ed you, but you did not know why.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Art of Pronunciation, like all others, is better learned by imitation than rule: But to be fir&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="037099_0031_100C4C2AB02735A0">
acquainted with the rules of it, will make the imitation more ea&s;y. You will ob&s;erve a certain agreeablene&s;s of manner in &s;ome orators, that is natural to them, not to be reduced to any rule, and to be learnt by imi|tation only; nor by that, unle&s;s it be in &s;ome degree natural to you.</P>
<P>You &s;hould frequently exerci&s;e your&s;elf to read aloud according to the foregoing rules.&mdash;It is practice only that mu&s;t give you the faculty of an elegant pro|nunciation. This, like other habits, is only to be attained by often repeated acts.</P>
<P>Orators, as well as poets, mu&s;t be born &s;o, or they will never excel in their re&s;pective arts: But that part of oratory which con&s;i&s;ts in a decent and graceful pro|nunciation, provided there be no defect in the organs of &s;peech, may be attained by rule, imitation, and practice; and, when attained, will give a beauty to &s;peech, a force to thoughts, and a plea&s;ure to the hearers, not to be expre&s;&s;ed; and which all will admire, but none can imitate, unle&s;s they are fir&s;t prepared for it by art and nature&mdash;In &s;hort, the great advantage of a ju&s;t pro|nunciation is, that it will plea&s;e all, whether they have no ta&s;te, a bad ta&s;te, or a good ta&s;te.</P>

part of mankind endeavor to procure in the little circle of their friends and acquaintance. The poore&s;t mechanic, the man who lives upon common arms, gets him his &s;et of admirers, and delights in that &s;uperiority which he enjoys over tho&s;e who are in &s;ome re&s;pect beneath him. This ambition, which is natu|ral to the &s;oul of man, might methinks receive a very happy turn; and, if it were rightly directed, contribute as much to a per&s;on's advantage, as it generally does to his unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;quiet.</P>
<BIBL>SPECTATOR.</BIBL>
<P>If we look abroad upon the great multitude of man|kind, and endeavor to trace out the principles of action in every individual, it will, I think, &s;eem highly probable, that ambition runs through the whole &s;pe|cies, and that every man, in proportion to the vigor of his complexion, is more or le&s;s actuated by it. It is indeed no uncommon thing to meet with men, who by the natural bent of their inclinations, and without the di&s;cipline of philo&s;ophy, a&s;pire not to the heights of power and grandeur; who never &s;et their hearts upon a numerous train of clients and dependen|cies, nor other gay appendages of greatne&s;s; who are contented with a competency, and will not mole&s;t their tranquility to gain an abundance. But it is not there|fore to be concluded, that &s;uch a man is not ambitious. His de&s;ires may cut out another channel, and deter|mine him to other pur&s;uits; the motive may be, how|ever, &s;till the &s;ame; and in tho&s;e ca&s;es, likewi&s;e, the man may be equally pu&s;hed on with the de&s;ire of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Though the pure con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of worthy actions, ab&s;tracted from the views of popular applau&s;e, be to a generous mind an ample reward; yet the de&s;ire of di&s;tinction was doubtle&s;s implanted in our natures as an additional incentive to exert our&s;elves in virtuous excellence.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="037099_0037_100C4C3975821AD8">
This pa&s;&s;ion, like all others, is frequently perverted to evil and ignoble purpo&s;es; &s;o that we may account for many of the excellencies and follies of life upon the &s;ame innate principles; to wit, the de&s;ire of being remarkable. For this, as it has been differently cul|tivated by education, &s;tudy, and conver&s;e, will bring forth &s;uitable effects, as it falls in with an ingenious companion, or a corrupt mind: it does al&s;o expre&s;s it&s;elf in acts of magnanimity or &s;elfi&s;h cunning, as it meets with a good or weak under&s;tanding. As it has been employed in embelli&s;hing the mind, or adorning the out&s;ide, it renders the man eminently prai&s;e-worthy or ridiculous. Ambition, therefore, is not to be con|fined only to one pa&s;&s;ion or pur&s;uit; for as the &s;ame humours, in con&s;titutions otherwi&s;e different, affect the body after different manners, &s;o the &s;ame a&s;piring principle within us &s;ometimes breaks forth upon one object, &s;ometimes upon another.</P>
<P>It cannot de doubted, but that there is as great a de&s;ire of glory in a ring of wre&s;tlers or cudgel-players, as in any other more refined competition for &s;uperiority. No man, that could avoid it, would ever &s;uffer his head to be broken, but out of a principle of honor.</P>
<P><HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Ambition rai&s;es a &s;ecret tumult in the &s;oul; it in|flames the mind, and puts it into a violent hurry of thought. It is &s;till reaching after an empty imaginary good, that has not in it the power to abate or &s;atisfy it. Mo&s;t other things we long for can allay the cravings of their proper &s;en&s;e, and for a while &s;et the appetite at re&s;t: but &s;ame is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o wholly foreign to our na|ture, that we have no faculty in the &s;oul adapted to it, nor any organ in the body to reli&s;h it; an object of de|&s;ire placed out of the po&s;&s;ibility of fruition.</P>
<P><HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>There is &s;carce a man living, who is not actuated by ambition. When this principle meets with an

<P>Of all the impertinent wi&s;hes which we hear expre&s;&s;ed in conver&s;ation, there is not one more un|worthy a gentleman, or a man of liberal education, than that of wi&s;hing one's &s;elf younger. It is a certain &s;ign of a fooli&s;h or a di&s;&s;olute mind, if we want our youth again only for the &s;trength of bones and &s;i|news which we once were ma&s;ters of. It is as ab&s;urd in an old man to wi&s;h for the &s;trength of a youth, as it would be in a young man to wi&s;h for the &s;trength of a bull or a hor&s;e. The&s;e wi&s;hes are both equally out of nature, which &s;hould direct in all things that are not contradictory to ju&s;tice, law, and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Age in a virtuous per&s;on of either &s;ex carries in it an authority, which makes it preferable to all the plea&s;ures of youth. If to be &s;aluted, attended, and con&s;ulted with deference, are in&s;tances of plea&s;ure, they are &s;uch as never fail a virtuous old-age. In the enumeration of the imperfections and advantages of the younger and later years of man, they are &s;o near in their condition, that methinks it &s;hould be incredible we &s;ee &s;o little commerce of kindne&s;s between them.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider youth and age with Tu&s;ly, regarding the affinity to death, youth has many more chances to be nearer it than age; what youth can &s;ay, more than an old man, "I &s;hall live till night?" Youth catches di&s;tempers more ea&s;ily, its &s;ickne&s;s is more violent, and its recovery more doubtful. The youth, indeed, hopes for many more days; &s;o cannot the old man. The youth's hopes are ill grounded; for what is more fooli&s;h than to place any confidence upon an uncertain|ty? But the old man has not room &s;o much as for hope; he is &s;till happier than the youth; he has already en|joyed

what the other does but hope for: one wi&s;hes to live long, the other has lived long. But, alas, is there any thing in human life, the duration of which can be called long? There is nothing, which mu&s;t end to be valued for its continuance. It hours, days, months, and years, pa&s;s away, it is no matter what hour, what day, what month, or what year we die. The applau&s;e of a good actor is due to him at whatever &s;cene of the play he makes his <HI>Exit.</HI> It is thus in the life of a man of &s;en&s;e; a &s;hort life is &s;ufficient to manife&s;t him&s;elf a man of honour and virtue; when he cea&s;es to be &s;uch, he has lived too long; and, while he is &s;uch, it is of no con&s;equence to him how long he &s;hall be &s;o, provided he is &s;o to his life's end.</P>

&s;ame rea&s;on, every one is eager to in&s;truct his neigh|bours. To be wi&s;e or to be virtuous, is to buy dignity and importance at a high price: but when nothing is nece&s;&s;ary to elevation but detection of the follies or the faults of others, no man is &s;o in&s;en&s;ible to the voice of fame as to linger on the ground.</P>

<P>There is nothing which we receive with &s;o much reluctance as advice. We look upon the man who gives it us, as offering an affront to our under&s;tanding, and treating us like children or idiots. There is no|thing &s;o difficult as the art of making advice agreeable: the pens of the ancients and moderns have been exerci&s;|ed upon this occa&s;ion. How many devices have been made u&s;e of to render this bitter potion palatable! Some convey their in&s;truction to us in the be&s;t cho&s;en words; others in the mo&s;t harmonious numbers; &s;ome in points of wit, and others in &s;hort proverbs.</P>
<P>But among all the different ways of giving coun|&s;el, that which plea&s;es the mo&s;t univer&s;ally, is <HI>fable:</HI> it excels all others, becau&s;e it is the lea&s;t &s;hock|ing, and therefore the mo&s;t delicate.

The one is the brevity of life, which, even at its longe&s;t duration, the wi&s;e&s;t of men hath compared to the &s;hort dimen&s;ion of a &s;pan. And the &s;econd, the uncertainty of it. Could the mo&s;t worldly men &s;ee this in the light in which they examine all other matters, they would &s;oon feel and acknowledge the force of this way of rea&s;oning. For which of them would give any price for an e&s;tate, from which they are liable to be immediately ejected; or would they not laugh at him as a madman, who accounted him&s;elf rich from &s;uch an uncertain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?</P>

<HEAD>AFFECTATION.</HEAD>
<P>The great misfortune of affectation is, that men not only lo&s;e a good quality, but al&s;o contract a bad one. They not only are unfit for what they were de&s;igned, but they a&s;&s;ign them&s;elves to what they are unfit for; and, in&s;tead of making a very good figure one way, make a very ridiculous one another. If <HI>Semanthe</HI> would have been &s;atisfied with her natural complexion, &s;he might &s;till have been celebrated by the name of the Olive-Beauty; but <HI>Semanthe</HI> has taken up an affecta|tion to white and red, and is now di&s;tingui&s;hed by the character of the lady that paints well.

<HEAD>AGREEABLE MAN.</HEAD>
<P>The de&s;ire of plea&s;ing makes a man agreeable or un|welcome to tho&s;e with whom he conver&s;es, according to the motive from which that inclination appears to flow. If your concern for plea&s;ing others ari&s;e from innate benevolence, it never fails of &s;ucce&s;s; if from a vanity to excel, its di&s;appointment is no le&s;s certain.
<PB N="52" REF="037099_0060_100C4C70854336B8">
What we call an agreeable man, is he who is endowed with the natural bent to do acceptable things, from a delight he takes in them merely as &s;uch; and the af|fectation of that character is what con&s;titutes a fop. Under the&s;e leaders one may draw up all tho&s;e who make any manner of figure, except in dumb &s;how. A rational and &s;elect conver&s;ation is compo&s;ed of per|&s;ons who have the talent of plea&s;ing with delicacy of &s;entiments, flowing from habitual cha&s;tity of thought. Now and then you meet with a man &s;o exactly formed for plea&s;ing, that will make him gain upon every body who hears or beholds him. This felicity is not the gift of nature only, but mu&s;t be attended with happy circum&s;tances, which add a dignity to the familiar be|haviour which di&s;tingui&s;hes him whom we call the a|greeable man. It is from this that every body loves and e&s;teems <HI>Polycarpus.</HI> He is in the vigor of his age, and the gaiety of his life; but has pa&s;&s;ed through very con&s;picuous &s;cenes in it: though no &s;oldier, he has &s;hared the danger, and acted with great gallantry and genero&s;ity, in a deci&s;ive day of battle. To have tho&s;e qualities which only make other men con&s;picuous in the world, as it were &s;upernumerary to him, is a cir|cum&s;tance which gives weight to his mo&s;t indifferent actions; for as a known credit is ready ca&s;h to a tra|der, &s;o is acknowledged merit immediate di&s;tinction, and &s;erves in the place of equipage to a gentleman. This renders <HI>Polycarpus</HI> graceful in mirth, important in bu&s;ine&s;s, and regarded with love in every ordinary occurrence.</P>

<P>Is a mark of politene&s;s. It is univer&s;ally agreed upon, that no one, unadorned with this virtue, can go into company without giving a manife&s;t offence. The ea&s;ier or higher any one's fortune is, this duty ri&s;es proportionably. The different nations of the world are as much di&s;tingui&s;hed by their cleanline&s;s, as by their arts and &s;ciences. The more any country is civilized, the more they con&s;ult this part of polite|ne&s;s.

<P>In the next place, cleanline&s;s may be &s;aid to be the fo&s;ter mother of love. Beauty indeed mo&s;t com|monly produces that pa&s;&s;ion in the mind, but cleanli|ne&s;s pre&s;erves it. An indifferent face and per&s;on, kept in perpetual neatne&s;s, has won many a heart from a pretty &s;lattern. Age it&s;elf is not unamiable, while it is pre&s;erved clean and un&s;ullied: like a piece of metal con&s;tantly kept &s;mooth and bright, we look on it with more plea&s;ure than on a new ve&s;&s;el which is cankered with ru&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>The conver&s;ation of mo&s;t men is di&s;agreeable, not &s;o much for want of wit and learning, as of good-breed|ing and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>If you re&s;olve to plea&s;e, never &s;peak to gratify any particular vanity or pa&s;&s;ion of your own, but always with a de&s;ign either to divert or inform the company. A man who only aims at one of the&s;e, is always ea&s;y in his di&s;cour&s;e. He is never out of humour at being interrupted, becau&s;e he con&s;iders that tho&s;e who hear him, are the be&s;t judges whether what he was &s;aying could either divert or inform them.</P>
<P>A mode&s;t per&s;on &s;eldom fails to gain the good will of tho&s;e he conver&s;es with, becau&s;e nobody envies a man who does not appear to be plea&s;ed with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>We &s;hould talk extremely little of our&s;elves. Indeed what can we &s;ay? It would be as imprudent to di&s;co|ver our faults, as ridiculous to count over our fancied virtues. Our private and dome&s;tic affairs are no le&s;s improper to be introduced in conver&s;ation. What does it concern the company how many hor&s;es you keep in your &s;tables? Or whether your &s;ervant is mo&s;t knave or fool?</P>
<P>A man may equally affront the company he is in by engro&s;&s;ing all the talk, or ob&s;erving a contemptuous &s;ilence.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="037099_0085_100C4CAC80648278">
Before you tell a &s;tory, it may be generally not ami&s;s to draw a &s;hort character, and give the company a true idea of the principal per&s;ons concerned in it; the beauty of mo&s;t things con&s;i&s;ting not &s;o much in their being &s;aid or done, as in their being &s;aid or done by &s;uch a particular per&s;on, or on &s;uch a particular occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the advantages of youth, few young people plea&s;e in conver&s;ation; the rea&s;on is, that want of experience makes them po&s;itive, and what they &s;ay is rather with a de&s;ign to plea&s;e them|&s;elves than any one el&s;e.</P>
<P>It is certain that age it&s;elf &s;hall make many things pa&s;s well enough, which would have been laughed at in the mouth of one much younger.</P>
<P>Nothing, however, is more in&s;upportable to men of &s;en&s;e, than an empty formal man who &s;peaks in pro|verbs, and decides all controver&s;ies with a &s;hort &s;en|tence. This piece of &s;tupidity is the more in&s;uffera|ble, as it puts on the air of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Whenever you commend, add your rea&s;ons for do|ing &s;o: it is this which di&s;tingui&s;hes the approbation of a man of &s;en&s;e from the flattery of &s;ycophants, and admiration of fools.</P>
<P>Raillery is no longer agreeable than while the whole company is plea&s;ed with it. I would lea&s;t of all be under&s;tood to except the per&s;on rallied.</P>
<BIBL>GUARDIAN.</BIBL>
<P>Ob&s;erve this rule in general; when&s;oever it lies in your power to lead the conver&s;ation, let it be directed to &s;ome profitable point of knowledge or practice, &s;o far as may be done with decency; and let not the di&s;|cour&s;e and the hours be &s;uffered to run loo&s;e without aim or de&s;ign, and when a &s;ubject is &s;tarted, pa&s;s not ha&s;tily to another, before you have brought the pre&s;ent theme of di&s;cour&s;e to &s;ome tolerable i&s;&s;ue, or a joint con&s;ent to drop it.</P>

<P>The man of contradiction &s;tands ready to oppo&s;e every thing that is &s;aid: he gives but a &s;light attention to the rea&s;ons of other men, from an inward &s;cornful pre&s;umption, that they have no &s;trength in them.

Your great di&s;puters, and your men of controver&s;y, are in contin|ual danger of this &s;ort of prejudice: they contend often for victory, and will maintain what&s;oever they have a&s;&s;erted, while truth is lo&s;t in the noi&s;e and tumult of reciprocal contradictions; and it frequently happens, that a debate about opinions is turned into a mutual reproach of per&s;ons.</P>

It is no part of civility or good breeding to part with truth, but to maintain it with decency and candor.</P>
<P>A &s;pirit of contradiction is &s;o pedantic and hateful, that a man &s;hould take much pains with him&s;elf to watch again&s;t every in&s;tance of it: he &s;hould learn &s;o much good-humour, at lea&s;t, as never to oppo&s;e any thing without ju&s;t and &s;olid rea&s;on for it: he &s;hould abate &s;ome degrees of pride and moro&s;ene&s;s, which are

<P>Charity is a virtue of the heart, and not of the hands, &s;ays an old writer. Gifts and alms are the expre&s;&s;ions, not the e&s;&s;ence of this virtue. A man may be&s;tow great &s;ums on the poor and indigent without being charitable, and may be charitable when he is not able to be&s;tow any thing. Charity therefore is a habit of good-will or benevolence in the &s;oul, which di&s;po&s;es us to the love, a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and relief of mankind, e&s;|pecially of tho&s;e who &s;tand in need of it. The poor man who has this excellent frame of mind, is no le&s;s entitled to the reward of this virtue, than the man who founds a college. For my own part, I am charitable to an extravagance this way: I never &s;aw an indigent per&s;on in my life, without reaching out to him &s;ome of this imaginary relief. I cannot but &s;ym|pathi&s;e with every one I meet that is in affliction, and if my abilities were equal to my wi&s;hes, there &s;hould be neither pain nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the world.</P>

<P>Sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to de|cide which of them &s;hall di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s a third of his do|minions, where neither of them pretend to any right. Sometimes one prince quarreleth with another, for fear the other &s;hould quarrel with him. Sometimes a war is entered upon becau&s;e the enemy is too &s;trong; and &s;ometimes becau&s;e he is too weak. Sometimes our neighbours want the things which we have, or have the things which we want; and we both fight till they take ours, or give us theirs. It is a very ju&s;tifiable cau&s;e of war, to invade a country after the people have been wa&s;t|ed by famine, de&s;troyed by pe&s;tilence, or embroiled by factions among them&s;elves. It is ju&s;tifiable to enter into a war again&s;t our neare&s;t ally, when one of his towns lie convenient for us, or a territory of land, that would render our dominions round and compact. If a prince &s;ends forces into a nation, where the people are poor and ignorant, he may lawfully put half of them to death, and make &s;laves of the re&s;t, in order to civilize and reduce them from their barbarous way of living.</P>

Alliance by blood or mar|riage is a frequent cau&s;e of war between princes; and the nearer the kindred is, the greater is their di&s;po&s;ition to quarrel. There is likewi&s;e a kind of beggarly prin|ces in Europe, not able to make war by them&s;elves, who hire out their troops to richer nations, for &s;o much a day to each man, of which they keep three fourths to them&s;elves, and it is the be&s;t part of their maintenance.</P>

That hou&s;e had &s;ome di&s;tant claim to a province, the la&s;t proprietor of which died of an apoplexy. The prince and his council in&s;tantly re&s;olve that this province belongs to him of divine right. The province, which is &s;ome hundred leagues from him, prote&s;ts that it does not &s;o much as know him; that it is not di&s;po&s;ed to be governed by him; that before pre&s;cribing laws to them, their con&s;ent at lea&s;t was nece&s;&s;ary: the&s;e allega|tions do not &s;o much as reach the prince's ears; it is in&s;i&s;ted on that his right is inconte&s;tible.

A treacherous friend is the mo&s;t dangerous enemy; and both religion and virtue have received more real di&s;credit from hypocrites, than the wittie&s;t profligates, or infidels could ever ca&s;t upon them; nay, farther, as the&s;e two in their purity, are rightly called the bands of civil &s;ociety, and are indeed the greate&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings; &s;o when poi&s;oned and corrupted with fraud, pretence, and affectation, they have become the wor&s;t of civil cur|&s;es, and have enabled men to perpetrate the mo&s;t cruel mi&s;chiefs to their own &s;pecies.</P>
<BIBL>FIELDING.</BIBL>
<P>The firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy of a true friend is a circum&s;tance &s;o extremely delightful to per&s;ons in any kind of di&s;tre&s;s, that the di&s;tre&s;s it&s;elf, (if it be only temporary, and admit of relief) is more than compen|&s;ated, by bringing this comfort with it.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P>So many qualities are nece&s;&s;ary to the po&s;&s;ibility of friend&s;hip, and &s;o many accidents mu&s;t concur to its ri&s;e and its continuance, that the greate&s;t part of man|kind content them&s;elves without it, and &s;upply its place as they can with intere&s;t and dependence.</P>
<BIBL>RAMBLER.</BIBL>
<P>Many have talked in very exalted language of the perpetuity of friend&s;hip: of invincible con&s;tancy and unalienable kindne&s;s; and &s;ome examples have been &s;een of men who have continued faithful to their ear|lie&s;t choice, and who&s;e affections have predominated over changes of fortune and contrariety of opinion. But the&s;e in&s;tances are memorable, becau&s;e they are rare. The friend&s;hip which is to be practi&s;ed or ex|pected by common mortals, mu&s;t take its ri&s;e from mutual plea&s;ure, and mu&s;t end when the power cea&s;es of delighting each other.</P>
<BIBL>IDLER.</BIBL>
<P>The mo&s;t fatal di&s;ea&s;e of friend&s;hip is gradual decay, or di&s;like hourly increa&s;ed by cau&s;es too &s;lender for
<PB N="136" REF="037099_0144_100C4D314E51D138">
complaint, and too numerous for removal. Tho&s;e who are angry may be reconciled. Tho&s;e who have been injured may receive a recompen&s;e; but when the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, and willingne&s;s to be plea&s;ed, is &s;i|lently dimini&s;hed, the renovation of friend&s;hip is hope|le&s;s; as when the vital powers &s;ink into languor, there is no longer any u&s;e of the phy&s;ician.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P>There are few &s;ubjects which have been more writ|ten upon, and le&s;s under&s;tood, than that of friend&s;hip. To follow the dictates of &s;ome, this virtue, in&s;tead of being the a&s;&s;uager of pain, becomes the &s;ource of every inconvenience. Such &s;peculati&s;ts, by expecting too much from friend&s;hip, di&s;&s;olve the connection, and, by drawing the bands too clo&s;ely, at length break them. Almo&s;t all our romance and novel-writers are of this kind; they per&s;uade us to friend&s;hips, which we find impo&s;&s;ible to &s;u&s;tain to the la&s;t; &s;o that this &s;weetner of life, under proper regulations, is by their means, ren|dered inacce&s;&s;ible or unea&s;y. It is certain, the be&s;t method to cultivate this virtue is by letting it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, make it&s;elf; a &s;imilitude of minds or &s;tudies, and even &s;ometimes a diver&s;ity of pur&s;uits, will pro|duce all the plea&s;ures that ari&s;e from it. The current of tenderne&s;s widens, as it proceeds; and two men imperceptibly find their hearts warm with good-nature for each other, when they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re at fir&s;t only in pur&s;uit of mirth or relaxation.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip is like a debt of honour; the moment it is talked of, it lo&s;es its real name, and a&s;&s;umes the more ungrateful form of obligation. From hence we find, that tho&s;e who regularly undertake to cultivate friend|&s;hip, find ingratitude generally repays their endeavours. That circle of beings, which dependence gathers round us, is almo&s;t ever unfriendly: they &s;ecretly wi&s;h the term of their connexions more nearly equal; and, where they even have the mo&s;t virtue, are prepared to re&s;erve all their affections for their patron, only in the
<PB N="137" REF="037099_0145_100C4D3496EA8BF0">
hour of this decline. Increa&s;ing the obligations which are laid upon &s;uch minds, only increa&s;es their burthen; they feel them&s;elves unable to repay the immen&s;ity of their debt, and their bankrupt hearts are taught a latent re&s;entment at the hand that is &s;tretched out with offers of &s;ervice and relief.</P>

<P>To hinder in&s;urrection by driving away the people, and to govern peaceably, by having no &s;ubjects, is an expedient that argues no great profundity of politics.

<P>All government, indeed every human benefit and enjoyment, every virtue, and every prudent act, is founded on compromi&s;e and barter.

To meliorate the condition of human nature, can be the only rational end of government. It can|not be de&s;igned to favor one de&s;cription of men, a <HI>mi|nority,</HI> at the expence of all others; who, having re|ceived life from him who alone can give it, received at the &s;ame time a right to enjoy it in liberty and &s;ecu|rity. This was the charter of God and nature; which no mortal, however elevated by conque&s;t or inheri|tance, can annul or violate without impiety. All gov|ernment which makes not the advancement of human happine&s;s, and the comfort of the individuals who are &s;ubject to its control, the <HI>prime</HI> purpo&s;e of its opera|tions, partakes of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>

<P>The majority of men are poor and ob&s;cure. To them all party attachments to names and families, little known as public benefactors, mu&s;t appear at once ab&s;urd and injurious. They are the per|&s;ons who &s;tand in mo&s;t need of protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the powerful. The rich under all gov|ernments, have a thou&s;and means of procuring either comfort or defence. It is the ma&s;s, the poor and middling ranks, unknown to, and unknowing courts or kings, who require all the alleviation which men enlightened by knowledge, furni&s;hed with opulence, elevated by rank, can afford to le&s;&s;en the natural evils of life, aggravated by the moral and artificial. Govern|ment po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of alleviating, and &s;ometimes of removing, that moral and phy&s;ical evil which em|bitters exi&s;tence. How deplorable, when government becomes &s;o perverted, as to increa&s;e the evil it was de|&s;igned to cure. Yet this has been, and is now the ca&s;e on a great part of the globe; in&s;omuch that the learn|ed and judicious Dr. Prideaux, who&s;e integrity is as well known as his ability, u&s;ed to &s;ay, "that it was a doubt with him, whether the benefit which the world receives from government, was &s;ufficient to make a|mends

<P>Few and evil are our days, even when they proceed to their natural extent, and are attended with the com|mon portion of health and pro&s;perity. Yet, as if a <HI>&s;uperfluity</HI> of years and happine&s;s were lavi&s;hed on men, the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of the greate&s;t part of governments on the whole earth has been to abbreviate life, to poi|&s;on and embitter its &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ures, and add new pungency to its angui&s;h. Yet &s;ee the fal&s;e <HI>glitter</HI> of happine&s;s, the pomp and parade which &s;uch govern|ments a&s;&s;ume; ob&s;erve the gravity and in&s;olence of &s;u|periority which their mini&s;ters, their &s;tate&s;men, and their warriors, a&s;&s;ume, and you would imagine them a commi&s;&s;ioned regency, lord lieutenants &s;ent by hea|ven to rule this lower world, and to rectify all di&s;or|ders which had e&s;caped the vigilance of the Deity. The time has been when they have actually claimed the title of God's vicegerents, and have been literally wor&s;hipped as gods by the &s;ervile crew of courtiers; men gradually bowed down by de&s;poti&s;m from the e|rect port of native dignity, and driven by fear to crouch under the mo&s;t degrading of all &s;uper&s;tition, the poli|tical idolatry of a ba&s;e fellow-creature.</P>

<P>I lay it down as an incontrovertible axiom, that all who are born into the world have a right to be as happy in it as the unavoidable evils of nature, and their own di&s;ordered pa&s;&s;ions, will allow. The grand object of all good government, of all government that is not an u&s;urpation, mu&s;t be to promote this happine&s;s, to a&s;|&s;i&s;t every individual in its attainment and &s;ecurity. A government chiefly anxious about the emoluments of office, chiefly employed in augmenting its own power and aggrandizing its ob&s;equious in&s;truments, while it neglects the comfort and &s;afety of individuals in mid|dle
<PB N="149" REF="037099_0157_100C4D51568DFCA0">
or low life, is de&s;potic and a nui&s;ance. It is found|ed on folly as well as wickedne&s;s, and, like the freaks of in&s;anity, deals mi&s;chief and mi&s;ery around, with|out being able to a&s;certain or limit its extent and dura|tion.

<P>For what rational purpo&s;e could we enter into life? To vex, torment, and &s;lay each other with the &s;word? To be and to make mi&s;erable?

Execrated and exploded be all tho&s;e politics, with Machiavel, or the Evil Being, their au|thor, which introduce &s;y&s;tems of government and man|ners among the great, incon&s;i&s;tent with the happine&s;s of the majority. Mu&s;t real tragedies be forever act|ing on the &s;tage of human life? Mu&s;t men go on for|ever to be tormentors and executioners of men? Is the world never to profit by the experience of ages? Mu&s;t not even <HI>attempts</HI> be made to improve the hap|pine&s;s of life, to improve government, though all arts and &s;ciences are encouraged in their progre&s;s to per|fection? Mu&s;t the grand art, the &s;ublime&s;t &s;cience, that of meliorating the condition of human nature, be &s;tationary? No; forbid it rea&s;on, virtue, benevolence, religion!

<BIBL>CHIPMAN'S Principles of Government.</BIBL>
<P>By the force of habit, and inveterate national preju|dices, abu&s;es are rendered &s;acred, and not unfrequent|ly, come to be con&s;idered as rightful privileges; and tho&s;e in&s;titutions, which were the off&s;pring of chance or violence, to be extolled as the mo&s;t perfect produc|tions of rea&s;on, &s;ounded in the original and unalterable principles of nature. Such was the Briti&s;h government, and &s;uch has been the force of habitual prejudice upon the people of that kingdom. That government has, indeed, received many improvements, with the im|provements of the age; but they have generally been wre&s;ted by force from the reigning powers, or interpo|&s;ed in a revolution of the crown. Many re&s;pectable characters long con&s;idered them as &s;o many violations of the mo&s;t &s;acred rights. The greater part of the na|tion

It is probable that all improvements in the government, will be oppo&s;ed and prevented by tho&s;e in power, who are intere&s;ted in the pre&s;ent or|der of things, till the improvements of an enlightened age, &s;hall produce a violent concu&s;&s;ion in the combat with ancient prejudices, and &s;truggle through a &s;cene of tumult, outrage, and perhaps civil war, to arrive at &s;ome incon&s;iderable amelioration, in their con&s;titu|tion.</P>

<P>The government of the United States of America exhibits a new &s;cene in the political hi&s;tory of the world; a number of integral republics, each claiming and exerci&s;ing all the powers of internal &s;overeignty, within the limits of their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions, formed into one general government, with powers of legi&s;lation for all national purpo&s;es, and the power of executing all their laws, within the &s;everal &s;tates, on the individual citizens, and that independently of the local authority. The experiment was new, and the &s;ucce&s;s has, hitherto, exceeded the mo&s;t &s;anguine ex|pectation of its advocates. A &s;ituation &s;o complicated, &s;o different from that of &s;imple governments, which have been the &s;ubject of the&s;e &s;ketches, will have an effect, if not upon the laws of nature, from which the general principles are ultimately derived, yet to give a different modification to tho&s;e principles, owing to the different combinations and relative circum&s;tances of the con&s;tituent parts; and will have an influence on its organization, and the execution of its laws.</P>

<P>In whatever &s;ituation men can be placed, they may find conveniencies and inconveniencies: in whatever company, they may find per&s;ons and conver&s;ation more or le&s;s plea&s;ing: at whatever table, they may meet with meats and drinks of better and wor&s;e ta&s;te, di&s;hes better and wor&s;e dre&s;&s;ed: in whatever climate, they will find good and bad weather: under whatever gov|ernment, they may find good and bad laws, and good and bad admini&s;tration of tho&s;e laws: in whatever po|em, or work of genius, they may &s;ee faults and beau|ties: in almo&s;t every face, and every per&s;on, they may di&s;cover fine features and defects, good and bad qualities.</P>

Tho&s;e who are to be unhappy, think and &s;peak only of the contraries. Hence they are continually di&s;contented them&s;elves,

and, by their remarks, four the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety; offend per&s;onally many people, and make them&s;elves every where di&s;agreeable. If this turn of mind was founded in nature, &s;uch unhappy per&s;ons would be the more to be pitied. But as the di&s;po&s;ition to critici&s;e, and to be di&s;gu&s;ted, is perhaps taken up originally by imitation, and is, unawares, grown into a habit, which, though at pre&s;ent &s;trong, may neverthele&s;s be cured, when tho&s;e who have it are convinced of its bad effects on their felicity: I hope this little admonition may be of &s;ervice to them, and put them on changing a habit, which, though in the exerci&s;e it is chiefly an act of imagination, yet has &s;erious con&s;equences in life, as it brings on real griefs and misfortunes. For as many are offended by, and nobody loves this &s;ort of people; no one &s;hews them more than the mo&s;t common civili|ty and re&s;pect, and &s;carcely that; and this frequently puts them out of humour, and draws them into di&s;|putes and contentions. If they aim at obtaining &s;ome advantage in rank or fortune, nobody wi&s;hes them &s;uc|ce&s;s, or will &s;tir a &s;tep, or &s;peak a word to favour their preten&s;ions. If they incur public cen&s;ure or di&s;grace, no one will defend or excu&s;e, and many join to aggra|vate their mi&s;conduct, and render them completely odious: if the&s;e people will not change this bad habit, and conde&s;cend to be plea&s;ed with what is plea&s;ing, without fretting them&s;elves and others about the con|traries, it is good for others to avoid an acquaintance with them; which is always di&s;agreeable, and &s;ome|times very inconvenient, e&s;pecially when one finds one's &s;elf entangled in their quarrels.</P>
<P>An old philo&s;ophical friend of mine was grown from experience, very cautious in this particular, and carefully avoided any intimacy with &s;uch people.

no in&s;trument invented to di&s;cover, at fir&s;t &s;ight, this unplea&s;ing di&s;po&s;ition in a per&s;on, he, for that purpo&s;e, made u&s;e of his legs; one of which was re|markably hand&s;ome, the other, by &s;ome accident, crooked and deformed. If a &s;tranger, at the fir&s;t inter|view, regarded his ugly leg more than his hand&s;ome one, he doubted him. If he &s;poke of it, and took no notice of the hand&s;ome leg, that was &s;ufficient to deter|mine my philo&s;opher to have no further acquaintance with him. Every body has not this two legged in&s;tru|ment; but every one, with a little attention, may ob|&s;erve &s;igns of that carping, fault-finding di&s;po&s;ition, and take the &s;ame re&s;olution of avoiding the acquaintance of tho&s;e infected with it.

<P>There is no virtue &s;o truly great and god-like as ju&s;tice. Mo&s;t of the other virtues are the virtues of created beings, or accommodated to our nature as we are men. Ju&s;tice is that which is practi&s;ed by God him&s;elf, and to be practi&s;ed in its perfection by none but him. Omni&s;cience and Omnipotence are requi|&s;ite for the full exertion of it. The one to di&s;cover every degree of uprightne&s;s in thoughts, words, and actions. The other, to mea&s;ure out and impart &s;uita|ble rewards and puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>As, to be perfectly ju&s;t is an attribute in the divine nature, to be &s;o to the utmo&s;t of our abilities is the glory of man. Such a one who has the public admini&s;tra|tion in his hands, acts like the repre&s;entative of his maker, in recompen&s;ing the virtuous, and puni&s;hing the offender.</P>
<P>When a nation once lo&s;es its regard to ju&s;tice; when they do not look upon it as &s;omething venerable, holy, and inviolable; when any of them dare pre&s;ume to le&s;&s;en, affront or terrify tho&s;e who have the di&s;tribution of it in their hands; when a judge is capable of being influenced by any thing but law, or a cau&s;e may be recommended by any thing that is foreign to its own merits, we may venture to pronounce that &s;uch a nation is ha&s;tening to its ruin.</P>

<P>In&s;tead of wondering that &s;o many kings, unfit and unworthy to be tru&s;ted with the government of man|kind, appear in the world, I have been tempted to wonder that there are any tolerable, when I have con|&s;idered the flattery that environs them mo&s;t commonly from the cradle, and the tendency of all tho&s;e fal&s;e no|tions that are in&s;tilled into them by precept and by ex|ample, by the habits of courts, and by the intere&s;ted &s;elfi&s;h views of courtiers.

<P>Louis the Fourteenth was a &s;trong in&s;tance of the effect of this education, which trains up kings to be tyrants, without knowing that they are &s;o. That op|pre&s;&s;ion under which he kept his people, during the whole cour&s;e of a long reign, might proceed, in &s;ome degree, from the natural haughtine&s;s of his temper; but it proceeded, in a greater degree, from the principles and habits of his education. By this he had been brought to look on his kingdom as a patrimony that de&s;cended to him from his ance&s;tors, and that was to be con&s;idered in no other light: &s;o that when a very con&s;iderable man had di&s;cour&s;ed to him at large of the mi&s;erable condition to which his people was reduced, and had frequently u&s;ed this word, <HI>l'etat,</HI> [the &s;tate;] though the king approved the &s;tub&s;tance of all he had &s;aid, yet he was &s;hocked at the frequent repetition of this word, and complained of it as of a kind of inde|cency to him&s;elf.</P>

<P>Civil governors go mi&s;erably out of their proper pro|vince whenever they take upon them the care of truth, or the &s;upport of any doctrinal points.

<P>Governments, no more than individual men, are in|fallible.

What &s;y&s;|tem of religion or government has not in its turn been patronized by national authority?

<P>What blood&s;hed and confu&s;ion have been occa&s;ion|ed from the reign of Henry IV. when the fir&s;t penal &s;tatutes were enacted, down to the revolution in England, by laws made to force con&s;cience! There is nothing certainly more unrea&s;onable, more incon&s;i&s;tent with the rights of human nature, more contrary to the &s;pirit and precepts of the chri&s;tian religion, more ini|quitous and unju&s;t, more impolitic, than per&s;ecution. It is again&s;t natural religion, revealed religion, and &s;ound policy.</P>
<P>Sad experience, and a large mind, taught that great man, the pre&s;ident de Thou, this doctrine. Let any man read the many admirable things, which he hath dared to advance upon this &s;ubject, in the dedication of his hi&s;tory to Henry IV. of France, (which I never read without rapture) and he will be fully convinced, not only how cruel, but how impolitic it is to per&s;e|cute for religious opinions.</P>

<P>The error &s;eems not &s;ufficiently eradicated, that the operations of the mind, as well as the acts of the body, are &s;ubject to the coercion of the laws.

<P>Con&s;traint may make a man wor&s;e by making him a hypocrite, but it will never make him a truer man. It may fix him ob&s;tinately in his errors, but will not cure them.

<P>Rea&s;on and experiment have been indulged, and error has fled before them. It is error alone which needs the &s;upport of government. Truth can &s;tand by it&s;elf. Subject opinion to coercion: whom will you make your inqui&s;itors? Fallible men; men governed by bad pa&s;&s;ions, by private as well as public rea&s;ons. And why &s;ubject it to coercion? To produce unifor|mity. But is uniformity of opinion de&s;irable? No more than of face and &s;tature. Introduce the bed of Procru&s;tes then, and as there is danger that the large men may beat the &s;mall, make us all of a &s;ize, by lop|ping the former and &s;tretching the latter. Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion. The &s;everal &s;ects perform the office of a cen&s;or morum over each other. Is uniformity attainable? Millions of inno|cent men, women, and children, &s;ince the introduction of Chri&s;tianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, im|pri&s;oned; yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half of the world fools, and the other half hypocrites; to &s;upport roguery and error all over the earth.</P>

The experiment was new and doubtful when they made it. It has an&s;wered beyond conception. They flouri&s;h infinitely. Religion is well &s;upported; of va|rious kinds, indeed, but all good enough; all &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve peace and order: or if a &s;ect ari&s;es, who&s;e tenets would &s;ubvert morals, good &s;en&s;e has fair play, and rea&s;ons and laughs it out of doors, without &s;uffering the &s;tate to be troubled with it. They do not hang more malefactors than we do. They are not more di&s;turbed with religious di&s;&s;entions. On the contra|ry, their harmony is unparalleled, and can be a&s;cribed to nothing but their unbounded tolerance, becau&s;e there is no other circum&s;tance in which they differ from every nation on earth. They have made the happy di&s;covery, that the way to &s;ilence religious di&s;putes, is to take no notice of them. Let us too give this experiment fair play, and get rid, while we may, of tho&s;e tyrannical laws. It is true, we are as yet &s;ecured again&s;t them by the &s;pirit of the times. I doubt whether the people of this country would &s;uffer an execution for here&s;y, or a three years impri&s;onment for not comprehending the my&s;teries of the Trinity. But is the &s;pirit of the peo|ple an infallible, a permanent reliance? Is it govern|ment? Is this the kind of protection we receive in return for the rights we give up? Be&s;ides, the &s;pirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will be|come corrupt, our people carele&s;s. A &s;ingle zealot may commence per&s;ecutor, and better men be his vic|tims. It can never be too often repeated, that the time for fixing every e&s;&s;ential right on a legal ba&s;is is while our rulers are hone&s;t, and our&s;elves united. From the conclu&s;ion of this war we &s;hall be going down hill. It will not then be nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;ort eve|ry moment to the people for &s;upport. They will be forgotten, therefore, and their rights di&s;regarded.

The princes of Europe have found out a manner of rewarding their &s;ubjects, by pre&s;enting them with a|bout two yards of blue ribbon, which is worn about the &s;houlder.

<P>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s and de&s;poti&s;m are more nearly allied than is commonly imagined. They are both alike in|con&s;i&s;tent with liberty, and the true end of government; nor is there any other difference between them, than that one is the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of great men, and the other the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of little men; or that by one, the per&s;ons and property of a people are &s;ubject to outrage and in|va&s;ion from a king, or a lawle&s;s body of grandees; and that by the other, they are &s;ubject to the like outrages from a lawle&s;s mob. In avoiding one of the&s;e evils, mankind have often run into the other. But all well-con&s;tituted governments guard equally again&s;t both.

<PB N="222" REF="037099_0230_100C4E10CF8269C8">
the pre&s;s under the protection of the prevailing party, and authori&s;e libels on one &s;ide only, and deny the other &s;ide the opportunity of defending them&s;elves.</P>
<P>What mi&s;chief is done by libels to balance all the&s;e evils? They &s;eldom or never annoy an innocent man, or promote any con&s;iderable error, Wi&s;e and hone&s;t men laugh at them, and de&s;pi&s;e them, and &s;uch ar|rows always fly over their heads, or fall at their feet. Mo&s;t of the world take part with a virtuous man, and puni&s;h c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lumny by their dete&s;tation of it. The be&s;t way to prevent libels is not to de&s;erve them. Guilty men alone fear them, or are hurt by them, who&s;e act|ions will not bear examination, and therefore mu&s;t not be examined. 'Tis fact alone which annoys them; for if you tell no truth, I dare &s;ay you may have their leave to tell as many lies as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ame is true in &s;peculative opinions. You may write non&s;en&s;e and folly as long as you think fit, and no one complains of it but the book&s;eller. But if a bold, hone&s;t, and wi&s;e book &s;allies forth, and attacks tho&s;e who think them&s;elves &s;ecure in their trenches, then their camp is in danger, and they call out all hands to arms, and their enemy is to be de&s;troyed by fire, &s;word, or fraud. But 'its &s;en&s;ele&s;s to think that any truth can &s;uffer by being thoroughly &s;earched, or exam|ined into; or that the di&s;covery of it can prejudice right religion, equal government, or the happine&s;s of &s;ociety in any re&s;pect: &s;he has &s;o many advantages above er|ror, that &s;he wants only to be &s;hown to gain admiration and e&s;teem; and we &s;ee every day that &s;he breaks the bonds of tyranny and fraud, and &s;hines through the mi&s;ts of &s;uper&s;tition and ignorance: and what then would &s;he do, if the&s;e barriers were removed, and her fetters taken off?</P>

<P>It is apprehended, that arbitary power would &s;teal in upon us, were we not careful to prevent its progre&s;s, and were there not an ea&s;y method of conveying the
<PB N="223" REF="037099_0231_100C329B5854DDD8">
alarm from one end of the kingdom to another. The &s;pirit of the people mu&s;t frequently be rou&s;ed, in order to curb the ambition of the court, and the dread of rou&s;ing this &s;pirit mu&s;t be employed to prevent that ambition. Nothing is &s;o effectual to this purpo&s;e as the liberty of the pre&s;s, by which all the learning, wit and genius of the nation may be employed on the &s;ide of freedom, and every one be animated to its defence. As long therefore as the republican part of our govern|ment can maintain it&s;elf again&s;t the monarchical, it will naturally be careful to keep the pre&s;s open, as of importance to its own pre&s;ervation.</P>

<P>Men are gregarious in their nature; they form to|gether in &s;ociety, not merely from nece&s;&s;ity, to avoid the evils of &s;olitude, but from inclination and mutual attachment. They find a po&s;itive plea&s;ure in yielding a&s;&s;i&s;tance to each other, in communicating their thoughts and improving their faculties. This di&s;po&s;i|tion in man is the &s;ource of morals; they have their foundation in nature, and receive their nouri&s;hment from &s;ociety. The different portions of this &s;ociety, that call them&s;elves nations, have generally e&s;tabli&s;hed the principle of &s;ecuring to the individuals who com|po&s;e a nation, the exclu&s;ive enjoyment of the fruits of their own labour; re&s;erving however to the governing power the right to reclaim from time to time &s;o much of the property and labour of individuals as &s;hall be deemed nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;ervice. This is the general ba&s;is on which property, public and private, has hitherto been founded. Nations have proceeded no farther. Perhaps in a more improved &s;tate of &s;o|ciety, the time will come, when a different &s;y&s;tem may be introduced; when it &s;hall be found more con|genial to the &s;ocial nature of man to exclude the idea of &s;eparate property, and with that the numerous evils which &s;eem to be entailed upon it.</P>

<P>It is our comfort, while we are obnoxious to &s;o many accidents, that we are under the care of one who directs contingencies, and has in his hands the manage|ment of every thing that is capable of annoying or offending us; who knows the a&s;&s;i&s;tance we &s;tand in need of, and is always ready to be&s;tow it on tho&s;e who a&s;k it of him.</P>
<P>The natural homage, which &s;uch a creature bears to &s;o infinitely wi&s;e and good a being, is a firm reliance on him, for the ble&s;&s;ings and conveniencies of life, and an habitual tru&s;t in him for deliverance out of all &s;uch dangers and difficulties as may befall us.</P>
<P>The man who always lives in this di&s;po&s;ition of mind, has not the &s;ame dark and melancholy views of human nature, as he who con&s;iders him&s;elf ab&s;tractedly from this relation to the Supreme Being. At the &s;ame time that he reflects upon his own weakne&s;s and im|perfection, he comforts him&s;elf with the contemplation of tho&s;e divine attributes, which are employed for his &s;afety and his welfare. He finds his want of fore&s;ight made up by the omni&s;cience of him who is his &s;upport. He is not &s;en&s;ible of his own want of &s;trength, when he knows that his helper is almighty.

<P>To make our lives more ea&s;y to us, we are com|manded to put our tru&s;t in him, who is thus able to relieve and &s;uccour us; the divine goodne&s;s having made &s;uch a reliance a duty, notwith&s;tanding we &s;hould have been mi&s;erable had it been forbidden us.</P>

<P>There is one circum&s;tance in the conduct of the <HI>tory</HI> friends to <HI>absolute sway,</HI> truly alarming to the champions of liberty. They are always inclined, on the &s;malle&s;t tumult, to call in the military. They would depreci|ate the civil powers, and break the con&s;table's &s;taff to introduce the bayonet. In their opinion, the be&s;t ex|ecutive powers of government are a party of dragoons. They are therefore con&s;tantly &s;ounding alarms, and ag|gravating every petty di&s;turbance into a riot or rebel|lion. They are not for parleying with the many-head|ed mon&s;ter; they &s;corn lenient mea&s;ures; and while their own per&s;ons are in perfect &s;afety, boldly com|mand the military to fire. What is the life or the limb of a poor man, in their opinion? Not &s;o much as the life or limb of a favorite pointer or race-hor&s;e. They are always eager to augment the army. They would build barracks in every part of the country, and be glad to &s;ee a free country over-run, like &s;ome of the en&s;laved nations of the continent, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, from north to &s;outh, with men armed to overawe the &s;aucy advocates of charters, privileges, rights, and re|formations.</P>

<P>Mini&s;ters become a &s;ort of miniature kings in their turn.

<P>Nature does nothing in vain; the creator of the univer&s;e has appointed every thing to a certain u&s;e and purpo&s;e, and determined it to a &s;ettled cour&s;e and &s;phere of action, from which if it in the lea&s;t deviates, it becomes unfit to an&s;wer tho&s;e ends for which it was de&s;igned. In like manner it is in the di&s;po&s;itions of &s;ociety; the civil economy is formed in a chain as well as the natural; and in either ca&s;e the breach but of one link puts the whole in &s;ome di&s;order. It is, I think, pretty plain, that mo&s;t of the ab&s;urdity and ridicule that we meet with in the world, is generally owing to the impertinent affectation, of excelling in characters men are not fit for, and for which nature never de&s;igned them.</P>
<P>Every man has one or more qualities which may make him u&s;eful both to him&s;elf and others; nature never fails of pointing them out, and while the infant continues under the guardian&s;hip, &s;he brings him on in his way, and then offers her&s;elf for a guide in
<PB N="244" REF="037099_0252_100C4E26D13BD1C8">
what remains of the journey; if he proceeds in that cour&s;e, he can hardly mi&s;carry: nature makes good her engagements; for as &s;he never promi&s;es what &s;he is not able to perform, &s;o &s;he never fails of performing what &s;he promi&s;es. But the misfortune is, men de&s;|pi&s;e what they may be ma&s;ters of, and affect what they are not fit for; they reckon them&s;elves already po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of what their genius inclines them to, and &s;o bend all their ambition to excel in what is out of their reach. Thus they de&s;troy the u&s;e of their natural talents, in the &s;ame manner as covetous men do their quiet and re|po&s;e; they can enjoy no &s;atisfaction in what they have, becau&s;e of the ab&s;urd inclination they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with for what they have not.</P>

<P>Whoever con&s;iders the number of ab&s;urd and ridi|culous oaths nece&s;&s;ary to be taken at pre&s;ent in mo&s;t countries, on being admitted into any &s;ociety or pro|fe&s;&s;ion whatever, will be le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed to find prevari|cation &s;till prevailing, where perjury has led the way.</P>
<P>While good faith reigned upon the earth, a &s;imple promi&s;e was &s;ufficient to in&s;ure confidence. Oaths owe their origin to perfidy. Man was not required to call upon the God that heard him to witne&s;s his veraci|ty, till he de&s;erved no longer to be believed. Magi&s;trates and &s;overeigns, to what do your regulations tend? You either oblige the man of probity to lift up his hand, and call heaven to witne&s;s, which with him is a requi&s;ition as injurious as it is u&s;ele&s;s; or you compel an oath from the mouth of a reprobate. Of what value can the oath of &s;uch a man appear to you? If the oath be contrary to his own &s;ecurity, it is ab&s;urd. If it be con&s;onant with his intere&s;t, it is &s;uperfluous. Does it argue a knowledge of the human heart, to give the debtor his choice between his ruin and a fal&s;ehood; or the criminal his option between death and perjury? Will the man whom motives of revenge, intere&s;t, or wickedne&s;s, have determined to give a fal&s;e te&s;timony, be deterred by the fear of committing one crime more? Is he not appri&s;ed, before he is brought up to the tri|bunal of ju&s;tice, that this formality will be required of him? And has he not from the bottom of his heart
<PB N="246" REF="037099_0254_100C4E28F01013C0">
de&s;pi&s;ed it, before he complied with it? Is it not a &s;pecies of impiety to introduce the name of God in our wicked di&s;putes? Is it not a &s;ingular mode of making heaven, as it were, an accomplice in the guilt, to &s;uffer that heaven to be called upon, which never has contra|dicted nor ever will contradict the oath? How intrepid, therefore, mu&s;t the fal&s;e witne&s;s become, when he has with impunity called down the divine vengeance on his head, without the fear of being convicted? Oaths &s;eem to be &s;o much deba&s;ed and pro&s;tituted by their frequen|cy, that fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es are grown as common as robbers.</P>

<P>One of the chief advantages derived by the pre&s;ent generation from the improvement and diffu&s;ion of philo&s;ophy, is deliverance from unnece&s;&s;ary terrors, and exemption from fal&s;e alarms.

Many men in our times, who wi&s;h to extend and aggrandize that power, from who&s;e arbitrary boun|ty they derive all the honour they are capable of acquir|ing, endeavour to throw contempt on philo&s;ophy. It may indeed be doubted whether they all know the meaning of the word; but they know it implies a me|rit not derived from princes, and therefore they wi&s;h to degrade it. Their fountain of honour, they con|ceive, has no re&s;emblance, in its nature or efficacy, to the famed fountains of Parna&s;&s;us: it conveys no in|&s;piration, except that which di&s;plays it&s;elf in the tumor of pride.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent age has heard up&s;tart noblemen give to philo&s;ophers (who&s;e genius and di&s;coveries entitle them to rank, in rea&s;on's table of precedency, above every nobleman in the red book) the opprobrious appellation of wretches and mi&s;creants. Philo&s;ophy and philo&s;o|phers have been mentioned by men, who&s;e attainments would only qualify them for di&s;tinction in a ball-room, with expre&s;&s;ions of hatred and contempt due only to thieves, murderers, the very outca&s;ts and refu&s;e of human nature.</P>

<P>Philo&s;ophy, &s;o far from de&s;erving contempt, is the glory of human nature. Man approaches by contempla|tion to what we conceive of cele&s;tial purity and excel|lence. Without the aid of philo&s;ophy, the ma&s;s of mankind, all over the terraqueous globe, would have &s;unk in &s;lavery and &s;uper&s;tition, the natural con&s;equen|ces of gro&s;s ignorance. Men at the very bottom of &s;ociety, have been enabled by the natural talents they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;econded by favorable opportunities, to reach the highe&s;t improvements in philo&s;ophy; and have thus lifted up a torch in the valley, which has expo&s;ed the weakne&s;s and deformity of the ca&s;tle on the mountain, from which the oppre&s;&s;ors &s;allied, in the night of dark|ne&s;s, and &s;pread de&s;olation with impunity. De&s;pots, the meane&s;t, the ba&s;e&s;t, the mo&s;t brutal and ignorant of

the human race, would have trampled on the rights and the happine&s;s of men unre&s;i&s;ted, if philo&s;ophy had not opened the eyes of the &s;ufferers, &s;hewn them their own power and dignity, and taught them to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e giants of power, as they appeared through the mi&s;ts of ignorance, who ruled a va&s;&s;al world with a mace of iron. Liberty is the daughter of philo&s;ophy; and they who dete&s;t the offspring, do all that they can to vilify and di&s;countenance the mother.</P>
<P>But let us calamly con&s;ider what is the object of this philo&s;ophy, &s;o formidable in the eyes of tho&s;e who are bigotted to ancient abu&s;es, who hate every improve|ment, and who wi&s;h to &s;ubject the many to the control of an arbitrary few. Philo&s;ophy is ever employed in finding out whatever is good, and whatever true. She darts her eagle eye over all the bu&s;y world, detects error and mi&s;chief, and points out modes of improvement. In the multiform &s;tate of human affairs, ever obnox|ious to decay and abu&s;e, it is her's to meditate on the means of melioration. She wi&s;hes to demoli&s;h nothing but what is a nui&s;ance. To build, to repair, to &s;trengthen, and to poli&s;h, the&s;e are the works which &s;he delights to plan; and, in concerting the be&s;t methods of directing their accompli&s;hment, &s;he con&s;umes the midnight oil. How can &s;he di&s;turb human affairs, &s;ince &s;he dwells in contemplation, and de&s;cends not to action? neither does &s;he impel others to action by the arts of delu&s;ive eloquence. She applies to rea&s;on alone; and if rea&s;on is not convinced, all that &s;he has done, is &s;wept away, like the web of Arachne.</P>

Tho&s;e that hear of it at a di&s;tance, or read of it in books, but have never pre&s;ented its evils to their minds, con&s;ider it as little more than a &s;plendid game, a proclamation, an army, a battle, and a triumph.

<P>The life of a modern &s;oldier is ill repre&s;ented by he|roic fiction. War has means of de&s;truction more formidable than the cannon and the &s;word.

By incommodious encamp|ments and unwhole&s;ome &s;tations, where courage is u&s;ele&s;s, and enterprize impracticable, fleets are &s;ilently di&s;peopled, and armies &s;luggi&s;hly melted away.</P>
<P>Thus is a people gradually exhau&s;ted, for the mo&s;t part with little effect. The wars of civilized nations make very &s;low changes in the &s;y&s;tem of empire.

<HEAD>THE WHISTLE.</HEAD>
<P>When I was a child, at &s;even years old, my friends on a holiday, filled my pocket with coppers. I went directly to a &s;hop where they &s;old toys for children; and being charmed with the &s;ound of a <HI>whistle,</HI> that I met by the way in the hands of another boy, I volun|tarily offered him all my money for one. I then came home, and went whi&s;tling all over the hou&s;e, much plea&s;ed with my <HI>whistle,</HI> but di&s;turbing all the family.
<PB N="301" REF="037099_0309_100C4EA1856C4288">
My brothers, and &s;i&s;ters, and cou&s;ins, under&s;tanding the bargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth. This put me in mind what good things I might have bought with the re&s;t of my money; and they laughed &s;o much at me for my folly, that I cried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the <HI>whistle</HI> gave me plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This however was afterwards of u&s;e to me, the im|pre&s;&s;ion continuing in my mind; &s;o that often, when I was tempted to buy &s;ome unnece&s;&s;ary thing, I &s;aid to my&s;elf, <HI>Don't give too much for the whistle;</HI> and &s;o I &s;aved my money.</P>
<P>As I grew up, came into the world, and ob&s;erved the actions of men, I thought I met with many, very ma|ny, who <HI>gave too much for the whistle.</HI></P>
<P>When I &s;aw any one too ambitious of court favors, &s;acrificing his time in attendance on levees, his repo&s;e, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps his friends to attain it, I have &s;aid to my&s;elf, <HI>This man gives too much for his whistle.</HI></P>
<P>When I &s;aw another fond of popularity, con&s;tantly employing him&s;elf in political bu&s;tles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by that neglect; <HI>He pays, indeed,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>too much for his whistle.</HI></P>
<P>If I knew a mi&s;er, who gave up every kind of com|fortable living, all the plea&s;ure of doing good to others, all the e&s;teem of his fellow-citizens, and the joys of be|nevolent friend&s;hip, for the &s;ake of accumulating wealth: <HI>Poor man,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>you do indeed pay too much for your whistle.</HI></P>
<P>When I meet a man of plea&s;ure, &s;acrificing every laudable improvement of the mind, or of his fortune, to mere corporeal &s;en&s;ations; <HI>Mistaken man,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>you are providing pain for yourself, instead of pleasure; you give too much for your whistle.</HI></P>
<P>If I &s;ee one fond of fine clothes, fine furniture, fine equipages, all above his fortune, for which he contracts

debts, and ends his career in pri&s;on; <HI>Alas,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>he has paid dear, very dear, for his whistle.</HI></P>
<P>When I &s;ee a beautiful, &s;weet-tempered girl, marri|ed to an ill natured brute of a hu&s;band: <HI>What a pity it is,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>that she has paid so much for a whistle.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, I conceive that great part of the mi&s;eries of mankind were brought upon them by the fal&s;e e&s;ti|mates they had made of the value of things, and by their giving too much for their <HI>whistles.</HI></P>

<HEAD>WISDOM.</HEAD>
<P>Wi&s;dom, who&s;e le&s;&s;ons have been repre&s;ented as &s;o hard to learn, by tho&s;e who were never at her &s;chool, only teaches us to extend a &s;imple maxim, univer&s;ally known, and followed even in the lowe&s;t life, a little farther than that life carries it, and this is, <HI>not to buy at too dear a price.</HI></P>
<P>Whoever takes this maxim abroad with him into the grand market of the world, and con&s;tantly applies it to honours, to riches, to plea&s;ures, and to every other commodity which that market affords, is a wi&s;e man, and mu&s;t be &s;o acknowledged in the worldly &s;en&s;e of the word; for he makes the be&s;t of bargains; &s;ince in reality he purcha&s;es every thing at the price only of a little trouble, and carries home all the good things I have mentioned, while he keeps his health, his inno|cence, and his reputation, the common prices which are paid for them by others, entire to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>From this moderation likewi&s;e he learns two le&s;&s;ons which complete his character; fir&s;t, never to be intox|icated when he hath made the be&s;t bargain, nor dejected when the market is empty; or when its commodities are to dear for his purcha&s;e.</P>
