<P>WHEN the death of men di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;uperi|or talents, high endowments, and eminent &s;ervices to their country, demands the expre&s;&s;ion of public mourn|ing and grief; their lo&s;s is accompanied generally with this mitigation, that, however grievous and painful, it is not irreparable; and that the void, cau&s;ed by their mortality, will perhaps be filled up by others, uniting equal abilities with the &s;ame zeal and watch|fulne&s;s for the general welfare. Hope then wipes off the tears, with which &s;orrow bedews the grave of departed worth. But on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, no &s;uch con&s;olation can be admini&s;tered; for he, who&s;e expectations are mo&s;t &s;anguine, dares not promi&s;e again to his country the union of &s;o many &s;plendid and u&s;eful virtues, as adorned that illu&s;trious Man, who&s;e memory excites our grateful and tender &s;en&s;i|bility, and to who&s;e tomb the homage of his country is to be &s;olemnly offered on this day. Whether we

con&s;ult our own experience, by bringing into compa|ri&s;on with Wa&s;hington, any of our cotemporaries, mo&s;t eminent for their talents, virtues and &s;ervices; or whether we &s;earch through the pages of hi&s;tory, to di&s;|cover in them a character of equal fame; ju&s;tice and truth will acknowledge, that he &s;tands &s;upereminent and unrivalled in the annals of mankind; and that no one before him, acting in &s;uch a variety of new and arduous &s;ituations, bore with him to the grave a repu|tation as clear from lawle&s;s ambition, and as undefiled by inju&s;tice or oppre&s;&s;ion; a reputation, neither depre&s;|&s;ed by indolence, nor weakened by irre&s;olution, nor &s;hadowed by tho&s;e imperfections, which &s;eemed to be the e&s;&s;ential appendages of human nature, till provi|dence exhibited in Wa&s;hington this extraordinary phenomenon.</P>
<P>What language can be equal to the excellence of &s;uch a character? what proportion can exi&s;t between eloquence, and the tribute of prai&s;e, due to &s;o much virtue? Neverthele&s;s, my fellow citizens, I read in the eagerne&s;s of your attention, your de&s;ire to offer this tribute: Methinks I hear your filial piety, your tender reverence for your be&s;t friend, the Father of his country, calling on me to bear for you, at lea&s;t a feeble testimony of your unextingui&s;hable gratitude for his &s;ervices, your immortal remembrance of, and veneration for his virtues. In your name therefore, I pre&s;ume to add &s;ome grains of incen&s;e to the ho|mage, which throughout the United States every friend to their happine&s;s now pre&s;ents at the &s;hrine of Wa&s;hington. Pardon, O departed Spirit of the first of

Heroes! if with the cold accents of an exhausted imagination, I likewi&s;e dare attempt to celebrate thy name, whilst &s;o many &s;ons of genius, ardent in youth|ful vigour, delineate in glowing colours the vivid features of thy mind, and the glorious deeds of thy virtuous life. With unequal steps I venture on the &s;ame career, not &s;eeking to add lustre to the fame of Wa&s;hington, or perpetuate his memory to future times; for he is already en&s;hrined in the records of immor|tality: but humbly hoping, that a recital of his &s;er|vices will open to our countrymen the road to true honour, and kindle in their breasts the warmth of ge|nerous emulation, and real patrioti&s;m. To contri|bute in this manner to the best interests of his belov|ed country, will be to him the most gratifying com|mendation, if in the regions of immortality, human affairs still claim a &s;hare of his &s;olicitude.</P>
<P>The language uniformly held by Wa&s;hington, the maxim invariably inculcated and repeated by him in almost every public manifestation of his &s;entiments, was the acknowledgement of a &s;uperintending provi|dence, preparing, regulating and governing all human events for the accompli&s;hment of its eternal purpo&s;es, and predi&s;po&s;ing the in&s;truments, by which they are to be effected. Religion and ob&s;ervation had taught him, that God's provident wi&s;dom <HI>reacheth from end to end mightily, and disposeth all things sweetly.</HI> Wis. ch. 8. He contemplated with Christian piety, and the philo&s;ophy of a Sage, the most remarkable revo|lutions and occurrencies of former, as well as his own
<PB N="6" REF="037108_0005_100D8B959B0F2B78">
times; and learned there from to refer every human event to the moral government of a &s;upreme intel|ligent Being. This became the polar &s;tar, by which he was guided in his progre&s;s through life, and in all his anxious &s;olicitude for maintaining the liberty, perfecting the policy, pre&s;erving the peace, in&s;uring the stability of his country on the foundations of or|der and morality, and guarding it against the turbu|lence of faction, licentiousne&s;s, foreign ho&s;tility and artifice.</P>
<P>This virtuous maxim of religious, moral, and political wi&s;dom, &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed him, never perhaps was more illustrated, than by the cour&s;e of providence in preparing and adapting his body and mind to &s;uit the de&s;tinies of his life. He was to be him&s;elf a mo&s;t luminous proof of that truth, which was &s;o rooted in his &s;oul.</P>
<P>That infinite knowledge, which in its compre|hen&s;ive range through the whole extent of creation, embraces the future, no le&s;s di&s;tinctly, than pa&s;t and pre&s;ent contingencies, beheld the period approaching, when this va&s;t portion of America, now con&s;tituting the U. States; this country &s;pread through &s;o many climates; &s;o diver&s;ified in its productions; &s;o abun|dant in natural re&s;ources; &s;o benefited by land and water; &s;o admirably calculated for the employment of indu&s;try, and for affording &s;ub&s;i&s;tance to millions and millions, was to break the bonds of its antient connection with G. Britain, and, emancipated from

va&s;&s;alage, elevate it&s;elf to the &s;tation of a great, powerful and independent Empire!</P>
<P>A convul&s;ion &s;o violent in the political &s;y&s;tem of Europe and America, involved the demolition of deeply rooted habits and opinions. The a&s;&s;ociations ari&s;ing out of con&s;anguinity, habitual intercour&s;e, uni|ty of government, identity of laws, language and re|ligion were to be melted down, before that wonder|ful revolution could be compleated. A new people, uncon&s;cious before of their own &s;trength, were to feel in their phy&s;ical and moral energies the ripene&s;s of manhood. Accu&s;tomed to re&s;pect the nation, with which they would have to contend, as irre&s;i&s;tible in arms, and inexhau&s;tible in re&s;ources, they mu&s;t dare neverthele&s;s to make the vigorous effort, and conceive a reliance on their own native &s;trength. Powerful in|tere&s;ts, the nece&s;&s;ary effects of long e&s;tabli&s;hed govern|ment, would naturally counteract every tendency to|wards its downfall; but the&s;e intere&s;ts were to be re&s;i&s;t|ed by force, and borne down by the enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardor of patrioti&s;m.</P>

as much as is allowed to feeble mortals, his divine agency in preparing the means and conducting the progre&s;s of the American revolution, we may pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that heaven impre&s;&s;ed a character on the life of Wa&s;hington, and a temper on his &s;oul, which eminently qualified him to bear the mo&s;t con|&s;picuous part, and be its principal in&s;trument in ac|compli&s;hing this &s;tupendous work.</P>
<P>We trace as far back, as to his early youth, the evidences of this providential interpo&s;ition. Born in times, and circum&s;tances, unfavourable to the &s;pi|rit and exertions of bold enterpri&s;e, he however &s;oon devoted him&s;elf to u&s;eful and active exerci&s;es. He di&s;dained the inglorious ea&s;e, and ignoble pur&s;uits, which fettered, or perverted the talents of his young countrymen; unactive, not thro' choice, but want|ing objects and encouragement. To deliver Wa&s;h|ington from the danger of contracting &s;imilar habits, he was in&s;pired to embrace the hardy di&s;cipline of difficult and perilous labours, which added vigour to his con&s;titution, and a robu&s;tne&s;s to his nerves, that never after &s;hrunk from danger. Following the in&s;tinct of his towering genius, he had not reached the years of manhood, when he was engaged in enterpri&s;es pregnant with terror, and pre&s;enting to his view ob|jects of a mo&s;t formidable a&s;pect. He did not howe|ver enter on them with thoughtle&s;s temerity. At that early period he began, what he pre&s;i&s;ted in thro' life, to a&s;&s;ociate motives of public utility with mag|nanimous undertakings. The u&s;ual occupations of
<PB N="9" REF="037108_0008_100D8B9C04056B40">
his young countrymen were not a &s;ufficient employ|ment for his active mind: he therefore turned his views towards that va&s;t We&s;tern region, now &s;o fami|liar to our ears and acquaintance, but then known only by the terrors it in&s;pired, and the cruelties practiced by the &s;avage Indians, lurking in its fore&s;ts and rece&s;&s;es. He left the endearments of &s;ociety to explore the cour&s;es of rivers, to traverse plains and mountains far beyond the then inhabited frontiers; hoping to di&s;cover &s;ources, whence future opulence might flow to his country; to examine the producti|ons, and e&s;timate the fertility of immen&s;e tracts, ca|pable of rewarding the indu&s;try of thou&s;ands, pining in want and oppre&s;&s;ion in foreign lands; who&s;e de|&s;cendants might people the wilderne&s;s, beautify it by cultivation, and multiply the re&s;ources of his native province. In the&s;e atchievements, the heroic youth was to inure him&s;elf to hunger and thir&s;t; to lie on the damp earth without any covering, but the &s;pread|ing branches of the oak, and the canopy of the heav|ens; to accu&s;tom him&s;elf to the vici&s;&s;itudes of &s;ea&s;ons, the parching heat, and chilling fro&s;t; to herd with the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t; to be expo&s;ed to the toma|hawk and &s;calping knife; to be &s;urrounded by diffi|culties, yet never be di&s;heartened; to meet at every &s;tep the image of death, without ever being appalled, or admitting a momentary &s;entiment of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Imagine not my fellow citizens, that this is an ideal and fanciful repre&s;entation of Wa&s;hington's
<PB N="10" REF="037108_0009_100D8BA4739C1110">
youthful years. No: it is faintly, but truly copied from real &s;cenes of his life. Who, on the wing of imagination, has followed him, clambering over the lofty We&s;tern mountains, fording unfathomed and rapid rivers, expo&s;ing his invaluable life to innume|rable accidents of treachery and ho&s;tility, without &s;huddering for his exi&s;tence, and admiring his cool, collected courage, in conquering ob&s;tacles, and &s;ur|mounting danger? Such was the training and educa|tion, by which Providence prepared him for the ful|fillment of his future de&s;tinies.</P>
<P>Far different from his, were the motives, which urged the youth of Sparta and Rome to encounter toils of danger and oppo&s;ition. They obeyed the in|&s;titutions of their country; they were &s;timulated by the goad of a&s;piring ambition, and a de&s;ire of acquir|ing that fal&s;e glory, which, in the erroneous opini|ons of their cotemporaries, attached it&s;elf to the men, who carried deva&s;tation and carnage into the bowels of neighbouring nations. With better views, and &s;upe|rior courage, Wa&s;hington penetrated into the inho&s;|pitable confines of the &s;avage Indian; that he might render them the abodes of peace, and introduce into their bo&s;om the improvements of civilization. So &s;ucce&s;sfully the guardian angel of this cho&s;en Youth, mini&s;tring to the de&s;igns of Providence, had infu&s;ed already into his &s;oul the &s;weet &s;pirit of benevolence, together with heroical fortitude.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037108_0010_100D8BA60A4FA218">For him it was decreed, in the progre&s;&s;ion of his life, to defend, and ultimately to e&s;tabli&s;h, by ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary warfare, the liberties of his country. Providence therefore permitted a train of occurrences to en&s;ue, which &s;erved to furni&s;h his mind with the fir&s;t rudiments of military &s;cience, and di&s;cipline him to the vigilance and profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;oldier. At that time, two powerful European nations held North America in their &s;ubjection: their territories border|ed on each other, and each claimed rights, di&s;allowed by its rival power. One of them, France, &s;ent out a military force and her Indian allies, to occupy po&s;ts, deemed to be within the territory of Virginia, and contiguous to the &s;tations, &s;elected by Wa&s;hington, as be&s;t adapted to the protection of his native land: for his intrepidity and local knowledge had already plac|ed him at the head of a &s;mall body of his countrymen, collected together to &s;top the progre&s;s of the Invaders. With tho&s;e he covered the inhabitants from ho&s;tile encroachment; he won the confidence of the &s;avage Indian; and conducted a dangerous and intricate ne|gociation for a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>But the durable pre&s;ervation of peace depended not on the coun&s;els of America. England and France tran&s;ported their enmity to her &s;hores, and covered our country with ho&s;tile array. England, confident of her prowe&s;s and the di&s;cipline of her armies, would not commit the defence of her intere&s;ts to raw Pro|vincials. Wa&s;hington's ardent &s;oul &s;uffered him not to remain behind in &s;afety, while the &s;ecurity of his
<PB N="12" REF="037108_0011_100D8BA79DEC6298">
country was at &s;take. The hand of Providence lead him forward, that he might add to his experience and native fortitude. He fought under Braddock; and that ill-fated commander having paid by his death the tribute of his ra&s;hne&s;s; his army di&s;pirited by defeat, and flying before an enemy flu&s;hed with victory; Wa&s;hington in that perilous moment, gathered round him his fir&s;t companions in arms, and re&s;cued out of the jaws of death the remains of the vanqui&s;hed bat|tallions. He did more: he &s;tood in the front of dan|ger, and every where oppo&s;ing him&s;elf to the merci|le&s;s &s;avages, ready to bur&s;t as a dark cloud, fraught with the thunderbolts of heaven, on a terrified land, he averted the &s;torm, and re&s;tored to his trembling country the &s;erenity of hope, and peace.</P>
<P>The theatre of war was tran&s;ported afterwards to di&s;tant provinces of America. Then the &s;ame all-wi&s;e Providence, which had inured him to danger, prepared him for the toils of government, and the im|portant duty of &s;uperintending, in his riper years, the political admini&s;tration of a great and widely ex|tended people. His &s;ervices in the field had won the confidence of his fellow citizens; they committed to his vigilance and integrity their highe&s;t intere&s;ts in their legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly. In this &s;chool he perfected him&s;elf in the knowledge of mankind: he ob&s;erved the contentions of parties, the artifices and conflicts of human pa&s;&s;ions: he &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of curbing them by &s;alutary re&s;traints: he &s;tudied the complicat|ed &s;cience of legi&s;lation: he learned to venerate the
<PB N="13" REF="037108_0012_100D8BABF3388C80">
&s;anctity of laws, to e&s;teem them as the palladium of civil &s;ociety, and deeply inbibed this maxim, &s;o im|portant for the Soldier and the State&s;man, and which he ever after made the rule of his conduct, that the armed defenders of their country would break up the foundations of &s;ocial order and happine&s;s, if they availed them&s;elves of the turbulence of war, to violate the rights of private property, and per&s;onal liberty.</P>
<P>Thus Wa&s;hington, during the interval of peace, &s;tored his mind with the trea&s;ures of political wi&s;dom. The time was approaching for him to expend tho&s;e trea&s;ures on his country's welfare.</P>
<P>I need not recapitulate the origin of the di&s;con|tents between G. Britain, and her American depen|dencies. Suffice it to &s;ay, that America viewed the claims of the parent country, as incompatible with her freedom and happine&s;s. The great &s;oul of Wa&s;h|ington revolted at the idea of national degradation; but tempering his ardor with deliberate wi&s;dom, he a&s;&s;ociated with other Sages of his country, to meditate on her new and critical &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Here let us pau&s;e, fellow citizens, to contemplate this exalted man, revolving in his brea&s;t the natural and &s;ocial rights of human kind; comparing the&s;e with actual and impending grievances, and with the obli|gations of an allegiance due to a long e&s;tabli&s;hed go|vernment. Had lawle&s;s ambition reigned in his brea&s;t, he would have decided the public voice for immedi|ate ho&s;tility. But in this point al&s;o, Providence de&s;|tined
<PB N="14" REF="037108_0013_100D8BAD8C581090">
him to leave a memorable and &s;alutary example, He was not dazzled by the pro&s;pect of being elevated to the chief command of the military force of America. In his opinion, nothing could ju&s;tify a recurrence to the &s;word, and a revolt from e&s;tabli&s;hed authority, but extreme nece&s;&s;ity. All rea&s;onable means of re|dre&s;s &s;hould be tried, before a good citizen will di&s;&s;olve the fabric of government, and expo&s;e a people to the convul&s;ive &s;hocks of a revolution, the explo&s;ions of which no con&s;iderate man can promi&s;e him&s;elf to re|gulate, or fore&s;ee their termination.</P>
<P>A reflection here forces it&s;elf upon my mind, which I ought not to withold from my re&s;pectable au|ditors. Would to God, that the principal authors and leaders of the many revolutions, through which unhappy France has pa&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of a few years, would to God, that they had been influenced by a morality as pure and enlightened, as that of Wa&s;hington, and his a&s;&s;ociates in the fir&s;t Congre&s;s! What &s;cenes of carnage and cruelty! what private woes and public calamity would have been &s;pared to that ill-fated country? and how &s;acred and venera|ble would have &s;till remained to it the &s;anctuary of religion?</P>
<P>Wa&s;hington and his colleagues obeying at the &s;ame time the dictates of patrioti&s;m, and the duty of allegiance, repre&s;ented their wrongs to their Sovereign, and claimed their rights. On the event of their re|mon&s;trance, depended the redre&s;s of their grievances; or, if no redre&s;s followed, their ju&s;tification for &s;tand|ing
<PB N="15" REF="037108_0014_100D8BB010A60A08">
on their defence. Britain would not relent, and all, that remained to America, was &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, or re&s;i&s;tance. The election was &s;oon made; every one prepared him&s;elf for the awful conte&s;t, and all eyes and hopes were turned towards Wa&s;hington. With univer&s;al approbation he was &s;ummoned to place him&s;elf in the front of danger, and a&s;&s;ume &s;u|preme military command. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a citizen, at a moment &s;o critical, was an invaluable trea&s;ure, and an animating pre&s;age of the favourable i&s;&s;ue of the great conte&s;t.</P>
<P>But far other thoughts ab&s;orbed his attention. Mode&s;t, as he was eminent in valour and wi&s;dom, he contemplated with mingled emotions of &s;elf-diffi|dence, and generous re&s;olution, the important &s;take placed in his hands; the &s;ubjection or independence; the va&s;&s;alage or freedom of an immen&s;e territory, de&s;tined to be the habitation of countle&s;s millions. When therefore, in obedience to the voice of his country, he placed him&s;elf at the head of her army, the expre&s;&s;ions of his dependence on Providence &s;hould never be forgotten. Claiming no per&s;onal merit, apprehen&s;ive of injuring the public intere&s;t through &s;ome mi&s;conduct; yet tru&s;ting to the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, and con&s;cious of the purity of his mo|tives, he called upon his fellow citizens to remem|ber, that he depended for &s;ucce&s;s, not on his own military &s;kill, but on the God of battles, to whom he made his &s;olemn appeal.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="037108_0015_100D8BB1D5C593F0">Wa&s;hington, now at a period of his highe&s;t ele|vation, drew on him the attention, not only of this We&s;tern Continent; but of every European nation. O fellow citizens! what days and years of anxious di&s;quietude revolved over us, whil&s;t we gazed on this &s;plendid luminary, uncertain whether it would &s;hed on its country the effulgence of victory and peace, crowned by liberty; or whether its brightne&s;s would be &s;hadowed by the clouds of di&s;a&s;ter and de|feat?</P>
<P>Here language fails: I dare not, I cannot follow the heroic Wa&s;hington in the career of his military glory. To baffle the &s;tratagems of the able&s;t Gene|rals, to repel the on&s;et of the brave&s;t, and be&s;t di&s;ci|plined armies, what had America to place in his hands? neither &s;oldiers trained to arms, or accu&s;tomed to &s;ub|ordination; nor the implements of war, nor the trea|&s;ures to purcha&s;e them. But the genius of the com|mander finally &s;upplied every deficiency. He intro|duced order and di&s;cipline; in&s;pired love and confi|dence; and with the&s;e auxiliaries, he kept together uncloathed and unpaid armies, which, under other generals, would perhaps have demanded ju&s;tice at the point of their bayonets. Always vigilant to foil ho&s;|tile attempts, he exhau&s;ted the re&s;ources of the enemy, without &s;uffering them to force him to action. Ten|der of the blood of his fellow &s;oldiers, and never ex|po&s;ing their lives without cau&s;e, or pro&s;pect of advan|tage, humanity was as dear to him, as victory; as his enemies, that fell into his power, always experienced.
<PB N="17" REF="037108_0016_100D8BB6878F9BA0">
When a decree of retaliation became nece&s;&s;ary to re|&s;train their licentious exce&s;&s;es, with what delicacy, without the lea&s;t abatement of fortitude, did he &s;ave the life of the victim, devoted to atone for the cruelty, that had been committed on an American officer? not however till he had compelled the oppo&s;ing General to re&s;train and di&s;avow outrages, that aggravate &s;o much the nece&s;&s;ary evils of war. How &s;acred was his re&s;pect to the civil authority; how effectual his pro|tection of the property of his fellow citizens? When the generous feelings of the virtuous and beneficient Lewis, who&s;e deplorable fate &s;hould draw tears of blood from every American heart, &s;ent out his Nobles, and legions, to combat by his &s;ide, the dignity of his man|ners and his una&s;&s;uming merit won their entire con|fidence: His integrity, and conciliating &s;pirit united, as a band of Brothers, nations before unknown to each other, and totally different in manners, habits and religion. Their union, of which he was the &s;oul, was a new omen of victory, and gained for America the prize, for which &s;he bled and contended; honour|able peace and Independence.</P>
<P>What but unfading laurels remained now for Wa&s;hington, after &s;atisfying his hone&s;t ambition, and &s;teering the ve&s;&s;el of the American republic, through &s;o many &s;torms, into the &s;afe harbour of liberty and tranquillity? It remained for him to leave this impor|tant le&s;&s;on to the chiefs of armies, ve&s;ted with great commands; that magnanimity and true glory con&s;i&s;t in laying down their &s;words at their country's &s;eet, when the object is attained, for which alone it was permitted to draw them. It remained for him, after

abdicating public employments, to exhibit in the &s;hade of retirement tho&s;e private virtues, which are the true foundations of national pro&s;perity. Dutiful to this moral principle, Wa&s;hington, before he left his army, &s;tipulated for no per&s;onal reward, and even refu&s;ed all that could be offered: Unmindful of him&s;elf, he was only &s;ollicitous to obtain for his faithful legions a generous and liberal acknowledgment of their con|&s;tancy and valour. This being effected, as far as it depended on him, he re&s;igned the in&s;ignia of his com|mand to tho&s;e, from whom he had received it, and re|&s;umed the rank of a private citizen, carrying with him into his dome&s;tic retreat, the e&s;teem, re&s;pect and veneration of an admiring world.</P>
<P>Here the curtain drops, and &s;eems to clo&s;e for ever from the public eye and public duty this wonder|ful man. His country has no more right to di&s;turb his calm repo&s;e: He has paid &s;uperabundantly her claim to his &s;ervices. But the views of providence over him are not yet compleated: Peace and indepen|dence are obtained; but to pre&s;erve them, experience &s;oon made it manife&s;t, that to invigorate with one &s;pirit the va&s;t ma&s;s of population throughout the U: States one general &s;uperintending government was e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite, which &s;aving the rights of all, &s;hould likewi&s;e be competent to command the &s;ervi|ces of all for the public weal; to maintain order with|in, and repel aggre&s;&s;ion from abroad; inforce the de|mands of ju&s;tice, and diffu&s;e over important national acts, dignity, energy, unity of de&s;ign and execution. Wa&s;hington's penetration &s;oon di&s;covered the want of &s;uch a government, &amp; in a paternal, affectionate addre&s;s to his countrymen, had bequeathed on them, as a lega|cy,
<PB N="19" REF="037108_0018_100D8BBA83976B18">
his earne&s;t recommendation for its e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>Various cau&s;es delayed the execution of this ne|ce&s;&s;ary work, till the edifice of American indepen|dance, un&s;upported by its nece&s;&s;ary pillars, was crumbling into ruin. Then every friend to his coun|try remembered Wa&s;hington's fatherly advice; eve|ry patriotic hand was ready to prop up the tottering fabric. Wi&s;dom and experience combined to blend in a republican form of government all the advanta|ges, of which other forms are productive, without many of their evils. Our illu&s;trious Deliverer pre|&s;ided at the deliberations, which produced it: The American people be&s;ought him once more to quit his beloved retreat, and perfect a work, of which he had been the fir&s;t founder and a principal architect. The earne&s;tne&s;s of their reque&s;t overpowered his re|luctant mind; he could not re&s;i&s;t their unanimous wi&s;hes, nor could any per&s;onal dangers &s;tand in com|petition with the advancement of general happine&s;s. Yet how immen&s;e were his &s;acrifices! how perilous his hazards! Sacrifices known only to them, who having &s;pent their be&s;t years in tran&s;actions, that kept every nerve on the &s;tretch, are permitted in the evening of their days to ta&s;te of the calm repo&s;e of rural felicity, and the &s;olace of dome&s;tic endearments. Di&s;heartening was the pro&s;pect in venturing again on the agitated ocean of national re&s;pon&s;ibility. There ex|i&s;ted not in the world a name &s;o bright as his: no charac|ter &s;tood on &s;uch lofty preeminence. Shall he expo&s;e the&s;e to the capricious fluctuations of popular opinion? Shall he embark, the trea&s;ure of a reputation purcha|&s;ed by &s;o many &s;ervices, on a &s;ea, &s;own thick with rocks of envy, pride and di&s;appointment? The&s;e were &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="20" REF="037108_0019_100D8BBC998639B8">
to appall a heart le&s;s &s;ublime, and le&s;s inflamed with genuine patrioti&s;m. But &s;uch con&s;iderations had no effect on him, and he took into his hands the helm of the State.</P>
<P>What were the effects of his admini&s;tration? are we not deceived by magical delu&s;ion? or is the trans|formation, which our &s;en&s;es witne&s;s, really effected? Have the U. States ri&s;en from a lethagic, impoveri|&s;hed, degraded condition to activity, opulence and re&s;pect? Does the farmer receive a generous retri|bution for his indu&s;try? does the merchant cover the &s;eas with his &s;hips, conveying to every clime the pro|ductions of our native &s;oil? does the public creditor obtain &s;ecurity and payment for his generous reliance on national faith? does ju&s;tice di&s;pen&s;e her equitable awards to every &s;uitor approaching her &s;anctuary? do di&s;tant nations re&s;pect the coun&s;els, and &s;ollicit the friend&s;hip of the U. States? are the natives of every land wafted to our &s;hores, as to the refuge of peace, the re&s;idence of true liberty? Yes, fellow citizens, this is not delu&s;ion. The&s;e are the real effects and monuments of Wa&s;hington's admini&s;tration. Yet it was thwarted and embarra&s;&s;ed by internal oppo&s;ition, and foreign intrigue. Scarce had we ta&s;ted of the &s;weets of peace, enlivened by indu&s;try and commerce, when attempts were made to ravi&s;h from us the&s;e in|e&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings, and plunge us into the horrors of war: not only of war, but of a war of that kind, which connecting our intere&s;ts and fate with that of a coun|try, delivered up to anarchy, and a prey to frantic, outrageous pa&s;&s;ions, would have tended to extingui&s;h among&s;t us the principles of morality; inflame us with the rage of innovation; intoxicate us with delu&s;ive,
<PB N="21" REF="037108_0020_100D8BBF722D5640">
ruinous theories of government; and mo&s;t probably, would have &s;ub&s;tituted them to that excellent con&s;ti|tution, which is, and may it long continue to be! our pride and happine&s;s. But, thanks to thy immortal &s;pirit, O ever dear and venerable Father of thy coun|try! thy wi&s;dom di&s;cerned the approaching &s;torm, and thy firmne&s;s baffled its violence. Our peace and con&s;titution remain to us, unimpaired. No foreign influence dictated to the coun&s;els of America. She increa&s;ed in vigour; &s;he ro&s;e in character; and by &s;elf-government, by keeping her&s;elf di&s;entangled from the &s;trifes of contending nations, &s;he evinced her&s;elf worthy of her independence.</P>
<P>After &s;ettling his country in this de&s;irable &s;tate, Wa&s;hington had fulfilled the de&s;tinies of that provi|dence, which formed him for the exalted purpo&s;e of diffu&s;ing the choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings over millions of men, and preparing the &s;ame for millions yet unborn. His wi&s;h to bury him&s;elf again in the &s;hades of retirement returned on him with redoubled force; to hide, if po&s;&s;ible, his greatne&s;s from the world; and in the &s;weet repo&s;e of dome&s;tic life, diver&s;ified however by u&s;eful and honourable occupations, to forget his pa&s;t glory. The la&s;t act of his &s;upreme magi&s;tracy was to inculcate in mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ive language on his country|men, or rather on his deare&s;t children, this, his deli|berate and &s;olemn advice; to bear ince&s;&s;antly in their minds, that nations and individuals are under the moral government of an infinitely wi&s;e and ju&s;t pro|vidence; that the foundations of their happine&s;s are morality and religion; and their union among&s;t them|&s;elves their rock of &s;afety: that to venerate their con|&s;titution and its laws is to in&s;ure their liberty. Then

he took his tender farewell of public employments, devoting the remainder of his precious life to a com|mendable &s;elf-review of it, through all its vici&s;&s;itudes and agitations; a review, for which every wi&s;e man, knowing his accountability to a &s;overeign Judge, &s;hould allot time and make opportunity.</P>
<P>After endeavouring thus far to &s;atisfy our com|mon duty to our illu&s;trious Deliverer, before I con|clude, I am earne&s;t, my fellow citizens, to leave im|pre&s;&s;ed on you, in &s;trong characters, &s;ome principal features of his mind, and furni&s;h you with &s;hort me|morials of his mo&s;t remarkable actions, hoping there|by to perpetuate your gratitude, and incite you to emulate his virtues. Happily, to &s;upply my inabili|ty, I find this ta&s;k executed, as it would &s;eem, by the &s;pirit of prophecy, and in the language of in&s;pira|tion, in the 8th chapter of the book of <HI>Wisdom</HI>; where the author's expre&s;&s;ions need no comment to appro|priate them to Wa&s;hington. So &s;triking the re&s;em|blance! &s;o true is the picture! Here are the words of the in&s;pired writer: <Q>I purpo&s;ed, &s;ays he, to take wi&s;dom with me to live with me, knowing that &s;he will communicate with me of her good things, and will be a comfort in my care&mdash;for her &s;ake I &s;hall have glory among the multitude, and honour with the antient, though I am young; and&mdash;I &s;hall be admired in the &s;ight of the mighty, and the faces of princes &s;hall wonder at me.&mdash;By the means of her, I &s;hall have immortality, and &s;hall leave behind me an everla&s;ting memory to them, that come after me. I &s;hall &s;et the people in order, and nations &s;hall be &s;ubject to me. Terrible kings hearing &s;hall be afraid of me; among the multitude I &s;hall be found

good and valiant in war. When I go into my hou&s;e, I &s;hall repo&s;e my&s;elf with her; for her conver&s;ation hath no bitterne&s;s, nor her company any tedious|ne&s;s, but joy and gladne&s;s. Thinking the&s;e things with my&s;elf, and pondering them in my heart, that to be allied to wi&s;dom, is immortality.&mdash;I went a|bout &s;eeking, that I might take her to my&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>In this picture, every &s;troke of the pencil exhi|bits traits of Wa&s;hington. The early maturity of his judgment was the fruit of his youthful conferences with wi&s;dom. She initiated him into her coun&s;els, and procured for him love, re&s;pect, honour, confidence, authority and command: She enabled him to <HI>set the people in order</HI> by good government, and an impartial, di&s;intere&s;ted admini&s;tration of it; and when, all pub|lic duties fulfilled, he <HI>went to his hou&s;e</HI> to repo&s;e him|&s;elf, <HI>no tediousness</HI> or <HI>bitterness</HI> mingled them&s;elves in their conver&s;ation, but <HI>joy and gladness,</HI> &s;erenity of mind, and the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of con&s;cious inte|grity.</P>
<P>Providence having pre&s;erved and lengthened his days, that he might rear up his country in the infan|cy of her independence, &s;uffered him now to withdraw him&s;elf from the di&s;quietudes of government. He had infu&s;ed the &s;pirit of his admini&s;tration into all its departments. His excellent Succe&s;&s;or inherited, not only the mantle of his office, but his wi&s;dom, firm|ne&s;s, and love of peace, &s;ubordinate only to a determi|nation of never purcha&s;ing it, at the price of national di&s;honour.</P>
<P>Wa&s;hington beheld from his retirement, as the Jewi&s;h legi&s;lator from the &s;ummit of mount Pha&s;ga, the flouri&s;hing pro&s;perity of his country. Health

&s;weetened his repo&s;e and rural occupations; his body and mind retained their u&s;ual vigour. We flattered our&s;elves with the expectation of his continuing long to retain them: Joy beamed in our hearts, when on every annual revolution, we gratefully hailed this, his au&s;picious birthday. But, alas! how dark is the cloud, that now over&s;hadows it? The &s;ongs of fe&s;ti|vity converted into the throbs of mourning! The prayers of thank&s;giving for his health and life chang|ed into lamentations for his death! Who feels not for him, as for his deare&s;t friend, his protector, and his Father? Whil&s;t he lived, we &s;eemed to &s;tand on loftier ground, for breathing the &s;ame air, inhabiting the &s;ame country, and enjoying the &s;ame con&s;titution and laws, as the &s;ublime and magnanimous Wa&s;hing|ton. He was inve&s;ted with a glory, that &s;hed a lu&s;tre on all around him. For his country's &s;afety, he often had braved death, when clad in her mo&s;t terrific form: he had familiari&s;ed him&s;elf with her a&s;pect; at her approaching to cut the thread of his life, he behold her with con&s;tancy and &s;erenity; and with his la&s;t breath, as we may believe from knowing the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul, he called to heaven to &s;ave his coun|try, and recommended it to the continual protection of that Providence, which he &s;o reverently adored. May his prayer have been heared! May the&s;e United States flouri&s;h in pure and undefiled religion, in mo|rality, peace, union, liberty and the enjoyment of their excellent Con&s;titution, as long as re&s;pect, ho|nour, and veneration &s;hall gather round the name of Wa&s;hington; that is, whil&s;t there &s;hall be any &s;urviv|ing record of human events.</P>
