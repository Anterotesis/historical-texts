<OPENER><SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I have been very unea&s;y in my mind for more than twen|ty years pa&s;t, being well per&s;uaded, that <HI>Thomas Go&s;s,</HI> was guilty of the murder of <HI>Elias Hopkins,</HI> late of Hartford: he was &s;lain in the year 1758; Go&s;s and Hopkins were companions in hunting, at or near Wood-Creek, in the fall of the year; Go&s;s came in and reported, that the Indians fired on him and Hopkins, killed Hopkins, took the furr, traps, &amp;c. On which a &s;couting party was di&s;patched in que&s;t of the body of Hop|kins,&mdash;who reported on their return, that Hopkins was &s;hot, hutt burn'd, furr &amp; traps mi&s;&s;ing; which report I believed; nor had I any &s;u&s;picion that Go&s;s was mi&s;chievous in the affair, till I returned from the &s;ervice, the &s;ame year; to my &s;urpri&s;e, I found that Go&s;s had conveyed home the traps, furr, Hop|kins's gun and &s;hoe-buckles, which I well knew to be his, while living:&mdash;but by taking advice, I &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould expo&s;e my|&s;elf, if I &s;aid much about it, being able to prove no more than what I have above related; I have therefore concealed my &s;u&s;picion till this time, but am ready to di&s;clo&s;e my knowledge more fully, if enquired of.</P>

</LETTER></NOTE> of <HI>New-Hartford,</HI> a companion with him in the year 1758, of which he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be guilty; &mdash;he replied, "It is a groundle&s;s mi&s;repre|&s;entation, and mu&s;t have been dictated by a malevolent di&s;po&s;ition, as Mr. <HI>Pelton</HI> is &s;up|po&s;ed &s;till to retain prejudices again&s;t me, on account of &s;ome animo&s;ities created between us while in &s;ervice together, which amount|ed to blows, and was never amicably adju&s;t|ed;"&mdash;giving the following advice re&s;pecting that unfortunate affair, viz. "As &s;oon as the term of my enli&s;tment had expired, wi&s;hing to pur&s;ue a more lucrative bu&s;ine&s;s than that of a &s;oldier, I left the encampment, in com|pany with a Mr. <HI>Flag</HI> and &s;aid <HI>Hopkins,</HI> deter|mining to erect a hut to &s;helter us from the inclemency of the weather, and when that was accompli&s;hed, to employ our&s;elves in hunting and trapping: con&s;equently, a hut was im|mediately con&s;tructed, &s;ituated in the mo&s;t unfrequented retirement of a &s;wamp, about &s;even miles from <HI>Fort Edward,</HI> and in the neighbourhood of the enemy (expo&s;ing our|&s;elves thus to danger in order to watch their movements, and give intelligence of the &s;ame; in which we rendered very e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices, and for which we received the &s;ame pay and rations as though enli&s;ted) where we lived to|gether in the greate&s;t harmony; making fre|quent and &s;ucce&s;sful, as well as very profita|ble hunting excur&s;ions&mdash;and were equal &s;ha|rers in the game&mdash;<HI>Hopkins</HI> generally remaining (not being &s;o well &s;kill'd in hunting as our|&s;elves) in charge of the company's property: But having once, however, during our ab|&s;ence, and without our concurrence, retired to <HI>Fort Edward</HI> with what &s;kins we had collect|ed, and to con&s;iderable amount, in order for di&s;po&s;al; and having made an injudicious traffic, by taking in exchange for them arti|cles that we did not want&punc; &s;uch as pi&s;tols, &amp;c it was propo&s;ed by <HI>Flag</HI> that <HI>Hopkins,</HI> in&s;tead of my&s;elf, &s;hould go with him&mdash;to which I reluctantly a&s;&s;ented, and returned into camp. &mdash;When they had proceeded about a mile from our habitation, <HI>Flag</HI> di&s;covered, from a &s;mall eminence, a party of Indians, going, as he imagined, to &s;urprize the garri&s;on at <HI>Fort Edward</HI>; who were marching in a hollow, a|bout 4 or 5 feet from the &s;urface of the ri&s;ing ground on their right and left.&mdash;<HI>Flag</HI> being a faithful and vigilant man, acquainted <HI>Hop|kins,</HI> that he would endeavour to count their numbers, and then retire to apprize the army; reque&s;ting him to remain &s;till, and not on any account to follow him; which he agreed to: &mdash;<HI>Hopkins,</HI> however, crept along undi&s;cover|ed by the enemy, and imprudently rai&s;ed his gun over Flag's &s;houlder to fire upon them:&mdash; which was prevented by being thrown back; &mdash;unhappily, however, in making a &s;econd attempt, they ob&s;erved a motion in the bu&s;hes, immediately &s;kulked behind trees, and put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence:&mdash;They fired, and mortally wounded Hopkins in the brea&s;t;&mdash;Flag was taken pri&s;oner, and as they knew him to be a trapper, obtained a pro|mi&s;e of good treatment on a di&s;covery of pro|perty; which terms he readily accepted, and conducted them to the hut&mdash;which they plun|dered, leaving only two traps behind, infor|mation of which was not given them.&mdash;Flag remained a pri&s;oner in <HI>Canada</HI> during the war, at the clo&s;e of which he returned, and from him I learnt the fate of Hopkins, &amp;c.&mdash;That the hut was burnt, (as repre&s;ented) no per|&s;on, unle&s;s a fool or madman, can &s;uppo&s;e to be true; as &s;uch an event would certainly have alarmed the army, and fru&s;trated the de&s;ign of the enemy."&mdash;<HI>Was you not &s;u&s;pected, and examined, as an offender in that affair?</HI> No; nor did I ever convey home any property belong|ing to Hopkins."&mdash;With re&s;pect to the au|thenticity of this account, the reader mu&s;t draw his own conclu&s;ions&punc; Mr. Pelton is &s;aid to be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> gentleman <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">eracity, and his charac|ter free from a&s;per&s;ions.</P>

In this place, I had it in con|templation to conceal her, after cutting her in pieces;&mdash;and while this was in agitation, I thought of a breach made in my cellar wall&mdash; in which the witches and wizards kept their trea&s;ure.&mdash;This place I examined, plunging a crow-bar twice into it;&mdash;and concluding to bury her here, I returned, in a few moments, to where &s;he lay, and took the body in my arms to di&s;po&s;e of accordingly;&mdash;but immediately laid it back.&mdash;<HI>Had you any thought of murdering the infant in bed with her?</HI>&mdash;The devil and I were at &s;trife about it.&mdash;He endeavoured to urge me to it; but the angels commanded the contrary, and I laid it carefully away.&mdash;<HI>Were you not jealous with re&s;pect to the cha&s;tity of your wife?</HI>&mdash;Yes, and confirm'd in that opinion by an acquaintance with her illicit corre&s;pond|ents;&mdash;&s;everal of whom were evidences again&s;t me on my trial.&mdash;<HI>Had you any private bicker|ings with your wife the day previous to the mur|der?</HI>&mdash;Not that I recollect; though we were &s;trangers to dome&s;tic happine&s;s &s;ome months before that event took place.&mdash;<HI>Did you com|plain to authority, and divulge your &s;u&s;picions?</HI>&mdash; Yes, but &s;ome of them being intimate with her, and free-ma&s;ons, acted partially, and put a ma&s;ter over me only.&mdash;<HI>Was it ju&s;tifiable, taking into con&s;ideration every circum&s;tance, to kill your wife?</HI>&mdash;To kill in &s;elf-defence is ju&s;|tifiable&mdash;&s;he had frequently threatened my life&mdash;and often when &s;itting at table.&mdash;Was it not ju&s;t in Mo&s;es to kill the Egyptian, and bury him in the &s;and?&mdash;<HI>He acted under the immediate influence of his divine Ma&s;ter&mdash;you, from a &s;pirit of malevolence, created by jealou&s;y.</HI> &mdash;You are indeed mi&s;taken,&mdash;I was &s;urround|ed with holy angels when I laid violent hands on my wife.&mdash;<HI>Would it not tend to your future happine&s;s, and be more &s;atisfactory to your children and friends, were you to conduct with &s;teadine&s;s and compo&s;ure of mind, by devoting the few re|maining hours of life, in &s;erious meditation, and advice of the clergy?</HI>&mdash;Reply, don't you ima|gine that men of liberal education are more intriguing, and do more frequently deceive the world than illiterate farmers.&mdash;And will you not allow that there are as many bad clergy|men, in proportion to their number, as of any other &s;ect?&mdash;As this is my opinion, why &s;hould I reque&s;t their advice or prayers, in preference to others.</P>

<P>Much might be &s;aid with re&s;pect to the conduct of this un|happy man. His behaviour while in pri&s;on has been &s;triking|ly &s;ingular. Previous to his trial he appeared very irrational.
