<P>FROM the beginning, the world has been favored in every age, with one or more eminent characters, who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, in a very remarkable man|ner, by their virtues, in promoting the public good.&mdash;The Great Governor of the Univer&s;e, when about to confer any &s;pecial favor upon any particular nation or people, has permitted them to be brought into &s;traits and difficulties, that in rai&s;ing up and in&s;piring &s;ome highly favored character among them, with wi&s;dom and courage to &s;uperintend the affairs of the body politick, they might be convinced they owed their deliverance to HIM, who &s;itteth upon the flood and rudeth <HI>King for|ever.</HI> In this chapter we have the dying te&s;timony of Stephen, relative to the deliverance of I&s;rael, after four hundred years bondage, by Mo&s;es, one of their own na|tion, whom the Lord had cho&s;en as their leader, who&s;e life was pre&s;erved amid&s;t innumerable dangers, and who, under the direction of Providence, was brought up in

the court of Egypt and was learned in all the wi&s;dom of the Egyptians, who were then famed for all manner of polite literature, particularly philo&s;ophy, a&s;tronomy and hieroglyphics. Mo&s;es receiving his education at court, had opportunities of improving him&s;elf by the be&s;t of au|thors, the be&s;t of tutors and the be&s;t of conver&s;ation in all the arts and &s;ciences and had a genius for them; by this means, he detected and confuted the a&s;trologers and magicians of Egypt and the way was paved for his en|tering upon the difficult and arduous ta&s;k of delivering his own nation from their long captivity and bondage.&mdash;Being advanced to the office of prime mini&s;ter of &s;tate, the favorite of heaven and the friend of the friendle&s;s Jews then under the hand of the oppre&s;&s;or, he was ren|dered con&s;picuous by his courage, conduct and &s;ucce&s;s, and being prepared by human helps and divine emula|tion, he became <HI>mighty</HI> in words and in deeds. After the miracles he wrought and the deliverances he procur|ed for I&s;rael, as an hone&s;t and faithful &s;ervant of God, He a&s;cribed all the glory to Him in who&s;e cau&s;e he em|barked and by who&s;e power he had been &s;u&s;tained. Up|on all occa&s;ions, he con&s;ulted the Lord and proved by his exemplary conduct that he feared and &s;erved the God of I&s;rael.</P>

BEING called together by the Executive and Legi&s;la|tive authority to celebrate the au&s;picious birth of the illu&s;trious GEORGE WASHINGTON, who was born February 22d, 1732, who&s;e name alone &s;trikes earthly titles dead, and to mourn his death, which took place December 14th, 1799, while authority commands and duty &s;upports that authority, gratitude and affection, which are the mo&s;t powerful con&s;traints, lay us under the mo&s;t plea&s;ing, yet painful nece&s;&s;ity of complying with the wi&s;hes of our rulers and of uniting with millions of our fellow-citizens in paying a &s;mall tribute to the mem|ory and &s;ublime virtues of our decea&s;ed and beloved de|liverer, guardian and father, and which humble tribute will no doubt be annually paid, while the page of hi&s;to|ry continues to hand down to po&s;terity the peculiar Ex|ploits and &s;ingular Virtues of one of the greate&s;t of Men that ever inhabited this lower world. Like Mo&s;es, he was &s;ingularly eminent in the following re&s;pects: Fir&s;t, In wi&s;dom&mdash;Secondly, In words&mdash;Thirdly, In deeds.</P>
<P>FIRST, Eminent in wi&s;dom. Though Mo&s;es was learned in all the wi&s;dom of the Egyptians, yet the fir&s;t and greate&s;t mark of his wi&s;dom appeared in his regard to the divine authority, in choo&s;ing GOD for his por|tion, embracing the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t expre&s;&s;ed in <HI>Ju|dah's

Thus proving like a wi&s;e man, that the concerns of the Soul were of infinitely greater importance than tho&s;e of a temporal nature; he regula|ted his conduct accordingly, as one made wi&s;e unto &s;al|vation. So our illu&s;trious Father decea&s;ed, was a parta|ker of that wi&s;dom which is from above which is "Pure, peaceable, gentle, ea&s;y to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocri|&s;y," therefore a man of prayer, a man of faith and a Man of God&mdash;He evidenced his religion by the &s;trictne&s;s of his morals, the integrity of his heart and his love to his country. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> influenced by corrupt principles or &s;elf|i&s;h motives, the happine&s;s of mankind lay near his heart, and his affection and zeal bur&s;t forth in liberating this exten&s;ive empire from the galling yoke of European tyranny. Long had oppre&s;&s;ion reigned and deluged this land with human blood. The mournful cries of widows, orphans and di&s;membered families had long been heard; yet not heard in vain. May we not adopt the language of a celebrated writer?</P>

<P>To re&s;cue mankind from the&s;e dreadful woes, was the labor and toil of the late illu&s;trious character. For this he was rai&s;ed up and qualified&mdash;for this he fought&mdash;for this he prayed, and in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this he rejoi|ced. In the victories he obtained, and in the nation's quiet enjoyment of the&s;e invaluable ble&s;&s;ings, he &s;heath|ed his &s;word, retired to his &s;hade and glorified his God.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Eminent, or mighty in words. Few they were but weighty; as well cho&s;en, as the &s;ubjects which called for them were important. The gentleman, the &s;cholar, the &s;tate&s;man, the warrior and the chri&s;tian &s;hine forth in his letters of corre&s;pondence, on all pub|lic

His word was a law&mdash;not enforced by arbitrary authori|ty, but by rea&s;on and argument, and as cheerfully was he obeyed as he humbly commanded. His words were fitly &s;poken, therefore, like apples of gold in pictures of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>THIRDLY. Eminent, or mighty in deeds. Read the hi&s;tory of the revolution&mdash;Contemplate the ble&s;&s;ings en|joyed as the fruit of his labors, and with me you will join in a&s;cribing the glory to God, as the author, while acknowledging the merit and prai&s;e due to his wi&s;dom, courage and prudence, as the in&s;trument. Eulogium upon eulogium and oration upon oration has been deliv|ered and circulated through the union to make the im|pre&s;&s;ion of his virtues upon our minds more plain and clear, and to emulate our youth with becoming ardour to imitate his bright example, that generations yet to come may &s;ee and be a&s;toni&s;hed at the great things the Lord has done for this highly favored nation, through the indefatigable labors of this great man.

<P>I &s;hould encroach upon the office of the hi&s;torian and do inju&s;tice to the character of the American Hero, were I to attempt to unfold his plans, to de&s;cribe his exploits, his battles, his victories and the fruits of all, in the va&s;t variety of ble&s;&s;ed con&s;equences which follow. While we admire the man, let us admire that wi&s;dom which direct|ed his mind and conduct&mdash;that power which &s;hielded him from every danger and that goodne&s;s which rendered him &s;ucce&s;sful in promoting and e&s;tabli&s;hing the liberty, independence and pro&s;perity of his country; and let us bow with cheerful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God in his removal from us, fully per&s;uaded that the God of Ame|rica is at no lo&s;s to rai&s;e up an Eli&s;ha to catch the falling mantle of our decea&s;ed Elijah.

He would di|rect our attention to one infinitely more de&s;erving our adoration, than even the mo&s;t u&s;eful and celebrated mortal, even to CHRIST JESUS, and to the character of this glorious per&s;on I now call your attention, who was before Abraham and who is a greater than Solomon, even God's fellow, and in whom dwells all the fulne&s;s of the Godhead bodily&mdash;Who is both white and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ddy, the chief among ten thou&s;and and altogether lovely&mdash;who&s;e head is as the mo&s;t fine gold, and who&s;e locks are bu&s;hy and black as a raven&mdash;who came from heaven upon the kind errand of peace, who fought our battles, gained our victories and invites us to gather up the &s;poils&mdash;Our &s;ituation, as &s;inners, was deplorable in the extreme, hopele&s;s and helple&s;s as to any a&s;&s;i&s;tance we could afford or had any rea&s;on to expect, left like the new born infant in the open field to peri&s;h without any eye to pity or hand to &s;ave.
