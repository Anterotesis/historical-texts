<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MANY &s;elections of excellent matter have lately been made for the benefit of young per&s;ons. Perform|ances of this kind are of &s;o great utility, that fre&s;h pro|ductions of them, and new attempts to improve the young mind, will &s;carcely be deemed &s;uperfluous, if the writer make his compilation in&s;tructive and intere&s;ting, and &s;ufficiently di&s;tinct from others.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent work, as the title expre&s;&s;es, aims at the attainment of three objects: to improve youth in the art of reading; to meliorate their language and &s;enti|ments; and to inculcate &s;ome of the mo&s;t important prin|ciples of piety and virtue.</P>
<P>THE pieces &s;elected, not only give exerci&s;e to a great variety of emotions, and the corre&s;pondent tones and variations of voice, but contain &s;entences, and members of &s;entences, which are diver&s;ified, proportioned, and pointed with accuracy. Exerci&s;es of this nature are, it is pre&s;umed, well calculated to teach youth to read with propriety and effect. A &s;election of &s;entences, in which variety and proportion, with exact punctuation, have been carefully ob&s;erved, in all their parts as well as with re&s;pect to one another, will probably have a much great|er effect, in properly teaching the art of reading, than is commonly imagined. In &s;uch con&s;tructions, every thing
<PB N="4" REF="038017_0004_1010D2F6EF5B3AE0">
is accommodated to the under&s;tanding and the voice; and the common difficulties in learning to read well, are obviated. When the learner has acquired a habit of reading &s;uch &s;entences, with ju&s;tne&s;s and facility, he will readily apply that habit, and the improvements he has made, to &s;entences more complicated and irregular, and of a con&s;truction entirely different.</P>
<P>THE language of the pieces cho&s;en for this collection, has been carefully regarded. Purity, propriety, per&s;pi|cuity, and, in many in&s;tances, elegance of diction, di&s;|tingui&s;h them. They are extracted from the works of the mo&s;t correct and elegant writers. From the &s;ources whence the &s;entiments are drawn, the reader may expect to find them connected and regular, &s;ufficiently important and impre&s;&s;ive, and dive&s;ted of every thing that is either trite or eccentric. The frequent peru&s;al of &s;uch compo&s;ition, naturally tends to infu&s;e a ta&s;te for this &s;pecies of excel|lence; and to produce a habit of thinking, and of com|po&s;ing, with judgment and accuracy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Grammatical Student, in his progre&s;s through this work, will meet with numerous in&s;tances of compo&s;ition, in &s;trict conformity to the rules for promoting per&s;picuous and ele|gant writing contained in the Appendix to the Author's Engli&s;h Grammar. By occa&s;ionally examining this conformity, he will be confirmed in the utility of tho&s;e rules; and be enabled to ap|ply them with ea&s;e and dexterity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT this collection may al&s;o &s;erve the purpo&s;e of promoting piety and virtue, the Compiler has introduced
<PB N="5" REF="038017_0005_1010D2F8B8B30F78">
many extracts, which place religion in the mo&s;t amiable light; and which recommend a great variety of moral duties, by the excellence of their nature, and the happy effects which they produce. The&s;e &s;ubjects are exhibited in a &s;tyle and manner, which are calculated to arre&s;t the attention of youth; and to make &s;trong and durable im|pre&s;&s;ions on their minds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In &s;ome of the pieces, the Compiler has made a few altera|tions, chiefly verbal, to adapt them the better to the de&s;ign of his work.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Compiler has been careful to avoid every ex|pre&s;&s;ion and &s;entiment, that might gratify a corrupt mind, or, in the lea&s;t degree, offend the eye or ear of innocence. This he conceives to be peculiarly incumbent on every per&s;on who writes for the benefit of youth. It would, indeed, be a great and happy improvement in education, if no writings were allowed to come under their notice, but &s;uch as are perfectly innocent; and if, on all proper occa&s;ions, they were encouraged to peru&s;e tho&s;e which tend to in&s;pire a due reverence for virtue, and an abhor|rence of vice, as well as to animate them with &s;entiments of piety and goodne&s;s. Such impre&s;&s;ions deeply engra|ven on their minds, and connected with all their attain|ments, could &s;carcely fail of attending them through life; and of producing a &s;olidity of principle and character, that would be able to re&s;i&s;t the danger ari&s;ing from fu|ture intercour&s;e with the world.</P>
<P>THE Author has endeavoured to relieve the grave and &s;erious parts of his collection, by the occa&s;ional ad|mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="6" REF="038017_0006_1010D2FBCAB16570">
of pieces which amu&s;e as well as in&s;truct. If, however, any of his readers &s;hould think it contains too great a proportion of the former, it may be &s;ome apology to ob&s;erve that, in the exi&s;ting publications de&s;igned for the peru&s;al of young per&s;ons, the preponderance is great|ly on the &s;ide of gay and amu&s;ing productions. Too much attention may be paid to this medium of improve|ment. When the imagination, of youth e&s;pecially, is much entertained, the &s;ober dictates of the under&s;tanding are regarded with indifference; and the influence of the good affections, is either feeble, or tran&s;ient. A tempe|rate u&s;e of &s;uch entertainment &s;eems therefore requi&s;ite, to afford proper &s;cope for the operations of the under|&s;tanding and the heart.</P>
<P>THE reader will perceive, that the Compiler has been &s;olicitous to recommend to young per&s;ons, the peru&s;al of the &s;acred Scriptures, by inter&s;per&s;ing through his work, &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful and intere&s;ting pa&s;&s;ages of tho&s;e invaluable writings. To excite an early ta&s;te and veneration for this great rule of life, is a point of &s;o high importance, as to warrant the attempt to promote it on every proper occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>TO improve the young mind, and to afford &s;ome a&s;|&s;i&s;tance to tutors, in the arduous and important work of education, were the motives which led to this production. If the Author &s;hould be &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as to accompli&s;h the&s;e ends, even in a &s;mall degree, he will think his time and pains well employed, and him&s;elf amply rewarded.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD READING.</HEAD>
<P>TO read with propriety is a plea&s;ing and impor|tant attainment; productive of improvement both to the under&s;tanding and the heart. It is e&s;&s;ential to a complete reader, that he minutely perceive the ideas, and enter in|to the feelings of the author, who&s;e &s;entiments he profe&s;|&s;es to repeat: for how is it po&s;&s;ible to repre&s;ent clearly to others, what we have but faint or inaccurate concep|tions of our&s;elves? If there were no other benefits re|&s;ulting from the art of reading well, than the nece&s;&s;ity it lays us under, of preci&s;ely a&s;certaining the meaning of what we read; and the habit thence required, of doing this with facility, both when reading &s;ilently and aloud, they would con&s;titute a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation for all the labour we can be&s;tow upon the &s;ubject. But the plea|&s;ure derived to our&s;elves and others, from a clear commu|nication of ideas and feelings; and the &s;trong and dura|ble impre&s;&s;ions made thereby on the minds of the reader and the audience, are con&s;iderations, which give an ad|ditional importance to the &s;tudy of this nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful art. The perfect attainment of it doubtle&s;s re|quires great attention and practice, joined to extraor|dinary

natural powers; but as there are many degrees of excellence in the art, the &s;tudent who&s;e aims fall &s;hort of perfection, will find him&s;elf amply rewarded for every exertion he may think proper to make.</P>
<P>To give rules for the management of the voice in reading, by which the nece&s;&s;ary pau&s;es, empha&s;is, and tones, may be di&s;covered and put in practice, is not po&s;|&s;ible. After all the directions that can be offered on the&s;e points, much will remain to be taught by the living in&s;tructor: much will be attainable by no other means, than the force of example influencing the imitative pow|ers of the learner. Some rules and principles on the&s;e heads will, however, be found u&s;eful, to prevent erroneous and vicious modes of utterance; to give the young rea|der &s;ome ta&s;te of the &s;ubject; and to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in acqui|ring a ju&s;t and accurate mode of delivery. The ob&s;er|vations which we have to make, for the&s;e purpo&s;es, may be compri&s;ed under the following heads: PROPER LOUD|NESS OF VOICE; DISTINCTNESS; SLOWNESS; PROPRI|ETY OF PRONUNCIATION; EMPHASIS; TONES; PAU|SES; and MODE OF READING VERSE.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. Proper Loudne&s;s of Voice.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t attention of every per&s;on who reads to others, doubtle&s;s, mu&s;t be, to make him&s;elf be heard by all tho&s;e to whom he reads. He mu&s;t endeavour to fill with his voice the &s;pace occupied by the company. This power of voice, it may be thought, is wholly a na|tural talent. It is, in a good mea&s;ure, the gift of nature; but it may receive con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance from art. Much depends, for this purpo&s;e, on the proper pitch and manage|ment of the voice. Every per&s;on has three pitches in
<PB N="9" REF="038017_0009_1010D305A059DC40">
his voice; the HIGH, the MIDDLE, and the LOW one. The high, is that which he u&s;es in calling aloud to &s;ome per&s;on at a di&s;tance. The low is, when he approaches to a whi&s;per. The middle is, that which he employs in common conver&s;ation, and which he &s;hould generally u&s;e in reading to others. For it is a great mi&s;take, to im|agine that one mu&s;t take the highe&s;t pitch of his voice, in order to be well heard in a large company. This is confounding two things which are different, loudne&s;s or &s;trength of &s;ound, with the key or note on which we &s;peak. There is a variety of &s;ound within the compa&s;s of each key. A &s;peaker may therefore render his voice louder, without altering the key: and we &s;hall always be able to give mo&s;t body, mo&s;t per&s;evering force of &s;ound, to that pitch of voice, to which in conver&s;ation we are accu&s;tomed. Whereas, by &s;etting out on our highe&s;t pitch or key, we certainly allow our&s;elves le&s;s compa&s;s, and are likely to &s;train our voice before we have done. We &s;hall fatigue our&s;elves, and read with pain; and whenever a per&s;on &s;peaks with pain to him&s;elf, he is al|ways heard with pain by his audience. Let us therefore give the voice full &s;trength and &s;well of &s;ound; but al|ways pitch it on our ordinary &s;peaking key. It &s;hould be a con&s;tant rule, never to utter a greater quantity of voice, than we can afford without pain to our&s;elves, and without any extraordinary effort. As long as we keep within the&s;e bounds, the other organs of &s;peech will be at liberty to di&s;charge their &s;everal offices with ea&s;e; and we &s;hall always have our voice under command. But whenever we tran&s;gre&s;s the&s;e bounds, we give up the reins, and have no longer any management of it. It is a u&s;eful rule too, in order to be well heard, to ca&s;t our eye
<PB N="10" REF="038017_0010_1010D30729A82388">
on &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tant per&s;ons in the company, and to con&s;ider our&s;elves as reading to them. We naturally and mechanically utter our words with &s;uch a degree of &s;trength, as to make our&s;elves be heard by the per&s;on whom we addre&s;s, provided he is within the reach of our voice. As this is the ca&s;e in conver&s;ation, it will hold al&s;o in reading to others. But let us remember, that in reading, as well as in conver&s;ation, it is po&s;&s;ible to offend by &s;peaking too loud. This extreme hurts the ear, by making the voice come upon it in rumbling indi&s;tinct ma&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>By the habit of reading, when young, in a loud and ve|hement manner, the voice becomes fixed in a &s;trained and unnatural key; and is rendered incapable of that variety of elevation and depre&s;&s;ion which con&s;titutes the true harmony of utterance, and affords ea&s;e to the reader, and plea&s;ure to the audience. This unnatural pitch of the voice, and di&s;agreeable monotony, are mo&s;t ob&s;ervable in per&s;ons who were taught to read in large rooms; who were accu&s;tomed to &s;tand at too great di&s;tance, when reading to their teachers; who&s;e in&s;tructors were very imperfect in their hearing; or who were taught by per|&s;ons, that con&s;idered loud expre&s;&s;ion as the chief requi&s;ite in forming a good reader. The&s;e are circum&s;tances which demand the &s;erious attention of every one to whom the education of youth is committed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II. Di&s;tinctne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>IN the next place, to being well heard and clearly un|der&s;tood, di&s;tinctne&s;s of articulation contributes more than mere loudne&s;s of &s;ound. The quantity of &s;ound nece&s;&s;ary to fill even a large &s;pace, is &s;maller than is com|monly
<PB N="11" REF="038017_0011_1010D30A23A92298">
imagined; and, with di&s;tinct articulation, a per&s;on with a weak voice will make it reach farther, than the &s;tronge&s;t voice can reach without it. To this, therefore, every reader ought to pay great attention. He mu&s;t give every &s;ound which he utters, its due proportion; and make every &s;yllable, and even every letter in the word which he pronounces, be heard di&s;tinctly; without &s;lur|ring, whi&s;pering, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ing any of the proper &s;ounds.</P>
<P>An accurate knowledge of the &s;imple, elementary &s;ounds of the language, and a facility in expre&s;&s;ing them, are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tinctne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, that if the learner's attainments are, in this re&s;pect, imperfect, (and many there are in this &s;ituation,) it will be incumbent on his teacher, to carry him back to the&s;e primary articula|tions; and to &s;u&s;pend his progre&s;s, till he become per|fectly ma&s;ter of them. It will be in vain to pre&s;s him forward, with the hope of forming a good reader, if he cannot completely articulate every elementary &s;ound of the language.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III. Due Degree of Slowne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to expre&s;s our&s;elves di&s;tinctly, moderation is requi&s;ite with regard to the &s;peed of pronouncing. Pre|cipitancy of &s;peech confounds all articulation, and all meaning. It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that there may be al&s;o an extreme on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. It is ob|vious that a lifele&s;s drawling manner of reading, which allows the minds of the hearers to be always outrunning the &s;peaker, mu&s;t render every &s;uch performance in&s;ipid and fatiguing. But the extreme of reading too fa&s;t is much more common; and requires the more to be guard|ed again&s;t, becau&s;e, when it has grown into a habit, few
<PB N="12" REF="038017_0012_1010D30BC6061570">
errors are more difficult to be corrected. To pronounce with a proper degree of &s;lowne&s;s, and with full and clear articulation, is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;tudied by all, who wi&s;h to become good readers; and it cannot be too much recom|mended to them. Such a pronunciation gives weight and dignity to the &s;ubject. It is a great a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the voice, by the pau&s;es and re&s;ts which it allows it more ea|&s;ily to make; and it enables the reader to &s;well all his &s;ounds, both with more force and more harmony.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION IV. Propriety of Pronunciation.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the fundamental attentions to the pitch and ma|nagement of the voice, to di&s;tinct articulation, and to a proper degree of &s;lowne&s;s of &s;peech, what the young reader mu&s;t, in the next place, &s;tudy, is propriety of pro|nunciation; or, giving to every word which he utters, that &s;ound which the be&s;t u&s;age of the language appro|priates to it; in oppo&s;ition to broad, vulgar, or provincial pronunciation. This is requi&s;ite both for reading intel|ligibly, and for reading with correctne&s;s and ea&s;e. In&s;truc|tions concerning this article may be&s;t be given by the liv|ing teacher. But there is one ob&s;ervation, which it may not be improper here to make. In the Engli&s;h language, every word which con&s;i&s;ts of more &s;yllables than one, has one accented &s;yllable. The accent re&s;ts &s;ometimes on the vowel, &s;ometimes on the con&s;onant. The genius of the language, requires the voice to mark that &s;yllable by a &s;tronger percu&s;&s;ion, and to pa&s;s more &s;lightly over the re&s;t. Now, after we have learned the proper &s;eats of tho&s;e accents, it is an important rule, to give every word ju&s;t the &s;ame accent in reading, as in common di&s;cour&s;e. Many per&s;ons err in this re&s;pect. When they read to
<PB N="13" REF="038017_0013_1010D30FF851D8C0">
others, and with &s;olemnity, they pronounce the &s;yllables in a different manner from what they do at other times. They dwell upon them, and protract them; they multi|ply accents on the &s;ame word; from a mi&s;taken notion, that it gives gravity and importance to their &s;ubject, and adds to the energy of their delivery. Whereas this is one of the greate&s;t faults that can be committed in pro|nunciation: it makes what is called a pompous or mouth|ing manner; and gives an artificial affected air to read|ing, which detracts greatly both from its agreeablene&s;s, and its impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sheridan and Walker have publi&s;hed dictionaries, for a&s;certaining the true and be&s;t pronunciation of the words of our language. By attentively con&s;ulting them, par|ticularly "Walker's Pronouncing Dictionary," the young reader will be much a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in his endeavours to attain a correct pronunciation of the words belonging to the Engli&s;h language.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION V. Empha&s;is.</HEAD>
<P>BY Empha&s;is is meant a &s;tronger and fuller &s;ound of voice, by which we di&s;tingui&s;h &s;ome word or words, on which we de&s;ign to lay particular &s;tre&s;s, and to &s;how how they affect the re&s;t of the &s;entence. Sometimes the em|phatic words mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a particular tone of voice, as well as by a particular &s;tre&s;s. On the right ma|nagement of the empha&s;is depends the life of pronunciati|on. If no empha&s;is be placed on any words, not only is di&s;cour&s;e rendered heavy and lifele&s;s, but the meaning left often ambiguous. If the empha&s;is be placed wrong, we pervert and confound the meaning wholly.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="038017_0014_1010D314606E2790">Empha&s;is may be divided into the SUPERIOR and the INFERIOR empha&s;is. The &s;uperior empha&s;is determines the meaning of a &s;entence, with reference to &s;omething &s;aid before, pre&s;uppo&s;ed by the author as general know|ledge, or removes an ambiguity, where a pa&s;&s;age may have more &s;en&s;es than one. The inferior empha&s;is <HI>en|forces, graces,</HI> and <HI>enlivens,</HI> but does not <HI>fix,</HI> the meaning of any pa&s;&s;age. The words to which this latter empha&s;is is given, are in general, such as &s;eem the mo&s;t important in the &s;entence, or, on other accounts, to merit this di&s;|tinction. The following pa&s;&s;age will &s;erve to exemplify the &s;uperior empha&s;is.</P>
<Q><L>"Of man's fir&s;t di&s;obedience, and the fruit</L>
<L>"Of that forbidden tree, who&s;e mortal ta&s;te</L>
<L>"Brought death into the world, and all our woe," &amp;c.</L>
<L>"Sing heav'nly Mu&s;e!"</L></Q>
<P>Suppo&s;ing that originally other beings, be&s;ides men, had di&s;obeyed the commands of the Almighty, and that the circum&s;tance were well known to us, there would fall an empha&s;is upon the word <HI>man's</HI> in the fir&s;t line; and hence it would be read thus:
<Q>"Of <HI>man's</HI> fir&s;t di&s;obedience, and the fruit," &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>But if it were a notorious truth that mankind had tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed in a peculiar manner more than once, the em|pha&s;is would fall on <HI>fir&s;t</HI>; and the line be read,
<Q>"Of man's <HI>fir&s;t</HI> di&s;obedience," &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Again, admitting death (as was really the ca&s;e) to have been an unheard-of and dreadful puni&s;hment, brought upon man in con&s;equence of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; on that &s;uppo&s;ition the third line would be read,
<Q>"Brought <HI>death</HI> into the world, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="038017_0015_1010D315E90CE558">But if we were to &s;uppo&s;e, that mankind knew there was &s;uch an evil as death in other regions, though the place they inhabited had been free from it till their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, the line would run thus:
<Q>"Brought death into the <HI>world,</HI>" &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;uperior empha&s;is finds place in the following &s;hort &s;entence, which admits of four di&s;tinct meanings, each of which is a&s;certained by the empha&s;is only.</P>
<Q>"Do you ride to town to-day?"</Q>
<P>The following examples illu&s;trate the nature and u&s;e of the inferior empha&s;is.</P>

<P>Among a number of per&s;ons, who have had proper op|portunities of learning to read, in the be&s;t manner it is now taught, very few could be &s;elected, who, in a given in|&s;tance,
<PB N="16" REF="038017_0016_1010D3199B4AE870">
would u&s;e the inferior empha&s;is alike, either as to place or quantity. Some per&s;ons, indeed, u&s;e &s;carcely any degree of it: and others do not &s;cruple to carry it much beyond any thing to be found in common di&s;cour&s;e; and even &s;ometimes throw it upon words &s;o very trifling in them&s;elves, that it is evidently done with no other view, than to give greater variety to the modulation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By modulation is meant that plea&s;ing variety of voice, which is perceived in uttering a &s;entence, and which, in its nature, is per|fectly di&s;tinct from empha&s;is, and the tones of emotion and pa&s;&s;ion. The young reader &s;hould be careful to render his modulation cor|rect and ea&s;y; and, for this purpo&s;e, &s;hould form it upon the mo|del of the mo&s;t judicious and correct &s;peakers.</NOTE>. Not|with&s;tanding this diver&s;ity of practice, there are certainly proper boundaries, within which this empha&s;is mu&s;t be re&s;trained, in order to make it meet the approbation of &s;ound judgment and correct ta&s;te. It will doubtle&s;s have different degrees of exertion, according to the greater or le&s;s degree of importance of the words upon which it operates; and there may be very properly &s;ome variety in the u&s;e of it: but its application is not arbitary, de|pending on the caprice of readers.</P>
<P>As empha&s;is often falls on words in different parts of the &s;ame &s;entence, &s;o it is frequently required to be continued, with a little variation, on two, and &s;ometimes more words together. The following &s;entences exemplify both the parts of this po&s;ition:
<Q>If you &s;eek to make one <HI>rich,</HI> &s;tudy not to <HI>increa&s;e his &s;tores,</HI> but to <HI>dimini&s;h his de|&s;ires.</HI></Q>
<Q>The Mexican figures, or picture-writing, repre&s;ents <HI>things</HI> not <HI>words:</HI> they exhibit <HI>images to the eye,</HI> not <HI>ideas to the under&s;tanding.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="038017_0017_1010D31E8643D220">Some &s;entences are &s;o full and comprehen&s;ive, that al|mo&s;t every word is emphatical: as
<Q>Ye hills and dales ye rivers, woods, and plains!</Q>
or, as that pathetic expo&s;|tulation in the prophecy of Ezekiel, "Why will ye die!"</P>
<P>Empha&s;is, be&s;ides its other offices, is the great regu|lator of quantity. Though the quantity of our &s;yllables is fixed, in words &s;eparately pronounced, yet it is mut|able, when the&s;e words are ranged in &s;entences; the long being changed into &s;hort, the &s;hort into long, according to the importance of the words with regard to meaning. Empha&s;is al&s;o, in particular ca&s;es, alters the &s;eat of the accent. This is demon&s;trable from the following exam|ples. "He &s;hall increa&s;e, but I &s;hall decrea&s;e."
<Q>There is a difference betwen giving and forgiving.</Q>
<Q>In this &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, plausibility is much more e&s;&s;ential than probability.</Q>
In the&s;e examples, the em|pha&s;is requires the accent to be placed on &s;yllables, to which it does not commonly belong.</P>
<P>In order to acquire the proper management of the em|pha&s;is, the great rule to be given, is, that the reader &s;tudy to attain a ju&s;t conception of the force and &s;pirit of the &s;entiments which he is to pronounce. For to lay the em|pha&s;is with exact propriety, is a con&s;tant exerci&s;e of good &s;en&s;e and attention. It is far from being an incon&s;ider|able attainment. It is one of the mo&s;t deci&s;ive trials of a true and ju&s;t ta&s;te; and mu&s;t ari&s;e from feeling deli|cately our&s;elves, and from judging accurately of what is fitte&s;t to &s;trike the feeling of others.</P>
<P>There is one error, again&s;t which it is particularly pro|per to caution the learner; namely, that of multiplying emphatical words too much, and u&s;ing the empha&s;is in|di&s;criminately. It is only by a prudent re&s;erve and di&s;|tinction
<PB N="18" REF="038017_0018_1010D32014080D40">
in the u&s;e of them, that we can give them any weight. If they recur too often; if a reader attemps to render every thing he expre&s;&s;es of high importance, by a multitude of &s;trong empha&s;is, we &s;oon learn to pay little regard to them. To crowd every &s;entence with empha|tical words, is like crowding all the pages of a book with Italic characters; which, as to the effect, is ju&s;t the &s;ame as to u&s;e no &s;uch di&s;tinctions at all.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VI. Tones.</HEAD>
<P>TONES are different both from empha&s;is and pau&s;es; con&s;i&s;ting in the notes or varia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions of &s;ound which we employ, in the expre&s;&s;ion of our &s;entiments. Empha&s;is affects particular words and phra&s;es, with a degree of tone or inflexion of voice; but tones, peculiarly &s;o call|ed, affect &s;entences, paragraphs, and &s;ometimes even the whole of a di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>To &s;how the u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity of tones, we need only ob&s;erve, that the mind, in communicating its ideas, is in a con&s;tant &s;tate of activity, emotion, or agitation, from the different effects which tho&s;e ideas produce in the &s;peaker. Now the end of &s;uch communication be|ing, not merely to lay open the ideas, but al&s;o the dif|ferent feelings whieh they excite in him who utters them, there mu&s;t be other &s;igns than words, to manife&s;t tho&s;e feelings; as words uttered in a monotonous manner, can repre&s;ent only a &s;imilar &s;tate of mind, perfectly free from all activity or emotion. As the communication of the&s;e internal feelings was of much more con&s;equence in our &s;ocial intercour&s;e, than the mere conveyance of ideas, the Author of our being did not, as in that conveyance,
<PB N="19" REF="038017_0019_1010D322F6AE2B40">
leave the invention of the language of emotion, to man; but impre&s;sed it him&s;elf upon our nature, in the &s;ame manner as he has done with regard to the re&s;t of the ani|mal world; all of which expre&s;s their various feelings, by various tones. Ours, indeed, from the &s;uperior rank that we hold, are in a high degree more comprehen&s;ive; as there is not an act of the mind, an exertion of the fancy, or an emotion of the heart, which has not its pe|culiar tone, or note of the voice, by which it is to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed; and which is &s;uited exactly to the degree of in|ternal feeling. It is chiefly in the proper u&s;e of the&s;e tones, that the life, &s;pirit, beauty, and harmony of deli|very con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The limits of this introduction, do not admit of exam|ples, to illu&s;trate the variety of tones belonging to the different pa&s;&s;ions and emotions. We &s;hall, however, &s;e|lect one, which is extracted from the beautiful lamenta|tion of David over Saul and Jonathan, and which will, in &s;ome degree, elucidate what has been &s;aid on this &s;ub|ject.
<Q>The beauty of I&s;rael is &s;lain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath; pub|li&s;h it not in the &s;treets of A&s;kelon:</Q>
left the daughters of the Phili&s;tines rejoice; le&s;t the daughters of the un|circumci&s;ed
<Q>triumph. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, nor fields of offer|ings; for there the &s;hields of the mighty was vilely ca&s;t away; the &s;hield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oyl!</Q>
Th fir&s;t of the&s;e divi&s;ions ex|pre&s;&s;es &s;orrow and lamentation; therefore the note is low. The next contains a &s;pirited command, and &s;hould be pronounced much higher. The other &s;entence, in which he makes a pathetic addre&s;s to the mountains where his friends had been &s;lain, mu&s;t be expre&s;sed in a note quite
<PB N="20" REF="038017_0020_1010C7174DBD74C0">
different from the two former; not &s;o low as the fir&s;t, nor &s;o high as the &s;econd, in a manly, firm, and yet plain|tive tone.</P>
<P>The correct and natural language of the emotions, is not &s;o difficult to be attained, as mo&s;t readers &s;eem to imagine. If we enter into the &s;pirit of the author's &s;en|timents, as well as into the meaning of his words, we &s;hall not fail to deliver the words in properly varied tones. For there are few people, who &s;peak Engli&s;h without a provincial note, that have not an accurate u&s;e of tones, when they utter their &s;entiments in earne&s;t di&s;cour&s;e. And the rea&s;on that they have not the &s;ame u&s;e of them, in reading aloud the &s;entiment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of others, may be traced to the very defective and erroneous method, in which the art of reading is taught; whereby all the various, natural, expre&s;&s;ive tones of &s;peech, are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and a few arti|ficial, unmeaning reading notes, are &s;ub&s;tituted for them.</P>
<P>But when we recommend to readers, an attention to the tone and language of emotions, we mu&s;t be under&s;tood to do it with proper limitation. Moderation is nece&s;&s;ary in this point, as it is in other things. For when reading becomes &s;trictly imitative, it a&s;&s;umes a theatrical manner, and mu&s;t be highly improper, as well as give offence to the hearers; becau&s;e it is incon&s;i&s;tent with that delicacy and mode&s;ty, which are indi&s;pen&s;able on &s;uch occa&s;ions. The &s;peaker who delivers his own emotions, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be more vivid and animated, than would be proper in the per&s;on who relates them at &s;econd hand.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude this &s;ection with the following rule, for the tones that indicate the pa&s;&s;ions and emotions.
<Q>In reading, let all your tones of expre&s;&s;ion be borrowed from tho&s;e of common &s;peech, but, in &s;ome degree, more
<PB N="21" REF="038017_0021_1010D32A44BD93C8">
faintly characterized. Let tho&s;e tones which &s;ignify any di&s;agreeable pa&s;&s;ion of the mind, be &s;till more faint than tho&s;e which indicate agreeable emotions: and, on all occa&s;ions, pre&s;erve your&s;elves &s;o far from being affected with the &s;ubject, as to be able to proceed through it, with that ea&s;y and ma&s;terly manner, which has its good effects in this, as well as in every other art.</Q></P>

<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION VII. Pau&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>PAUSES or re&s;ts, in &s;peaking or reading, are a total ce&s;&s;ation of the voice, during a perceptible, and, in many ca&s;es, a mea&s;urable &s;pace of time. Pau&s;es are equally nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;peaker, and the hearer. To the &s;peak|er, that he may take breath, without which he cannot pro|ceed far in delivery; and that he may, by the&s;e tempo|rary re&s;ts, relieve the organs of &s;peech, which otherwi&s;e would be &s;oon tired by continued action: to the hearer, that the ear al&s;o may be relieved form the fatigue, which it would otherwi&s;e endure from a continuity of &s;ound; and that the under&s;tanding may have &s;ufficient time to mark the di&s;tinction of &s;entences, and their &s;e|veral members.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of pau&s;es; fir&s;t, emphatical pau|&s;es; and next, &s;uch as mark the di&s;tinctions of &s;en&s;e. An emphatical pau&s;e is generally made, <HI>after</HI> &s;omething has been &s;aid of peculiar moment, and on which we de&s;ire to fix the hearer's attention. Sometimes, <HI>before</HI> &s;uch a thing is &s;aid, we u&s;her it in with a pau&s;e of this nature. Such pau&s;es have the &s;ame effect as a &s;trong empa&s;is; and are &s;ubject to the &s;ame rules; e&s;pecially to the cau|tion, of not repeating them too frequently. For as they
<PB N="22" REF="038017_0022_1010D32D55629FE8">
excite uncommon attention, and of cour&s;e rai&s;e expec|tation, if the importance of the matter be not fully an|&s;werable to &s;uch expectation, they occa&s;ion di&s;appoint|ment and di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t frequent and the principal u&s;e of pau&s;es, is, to mark the divi&s;ions of the &s;en&s;e, and at the &s;ame time to allow the reader to draw his breath; and the proper and delicate adju&s;tment of &s;uch pau&s;es, is one of the mo&s;t nice and difficult articles of delivery. In all reading, the management of the breath requires a good deal of care, &s;o as not to oblige us to divide words from one ano|ther, which have &s;o intimate a connexion, that they ought to be pronounced with the &s;ame breath, and without the lea&s;t &s;eparation. Many a &s;entence is mi&s;erably mangled, and the force of the empha&s;is totally lo&s;t, by divi&s;ions being made in the wrong place. To avoid this, every one, while he is reading, &s;hould be very careful to pro|vide a full &s;upply of breath, for what he is to utter. It is a great mi&s;take to imagine, that the breath mu&s;t be drawn only at the end of a period, when the voice is allowed to fall. It may ea&s;ily be gathered at the intervals of the pe|riod, when the voice is &s;u&s;pended only for a moment; and, by this management, one may always have a &s;ufficient &s;tock for carrying on the longe&s;t &s;entence, without im|proper interruptions.</P>
<P>Pau&s;es in reading mu&s;t generally be formed upon the manner in which we utter our&s;elves in ordinary, &s;en&s;ible conver&s;ation; and not upon the &s;tiff artificial manner, which is acquired from reading books according to the common punctuation. It will by no means be &s;ufficient to attend to the point u&s;ed in printing; for the&s;e are far from marking all the pau&s;es, which ought to be made in
<PB N="23" REF="038017_0023_1010D32EDF970558">
reading. A mechanical attention to the&s;e re&s;ting places, has perhaps been one cau&s;e of monotony, by leading the reader to a &s;imilar tone at every &s;top, and a uniform ca|dence at every period. The primary u&s;e of points, is to a&s;&s;i&s;t the reader in di&s;cerning the grammatical con&s;truc|tion; and it is only as a &s;econdary object, that they regu|late his pronunciation. On this head, the following di|rection may be of u&s;e:
<Q>Though in reading great at|tention &s;hould be paid to the &s;tops, yet a greater &s;hould be given to the &s;en&s;e; and their corre&s;pondent times oc|ca&s;ionally lengthened beyond what is u&s;ual in common &s;peech.</Q></P>
<P>To render pau&s;es plea&s;ing and expre&s;&s;ive, they mu&s;t not only be made in the right place, but al&s;o accompanied with a proper tone of voice, by which the nature of the&s;e pau&s;es is intimated; much more than by the length of them, which can &s;eldom be exactly mea&s;ured. Sometimes it is only a &s;light and &s;imple &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of voice that is proper; &s;ometimes a degree of cadence in the voice is required; and &s;ometimes that peculiar tone and cadence which denote the &s;entence to be fini&s;hed. In all the&s;e ca&s;es, we are to regulate our&s;elves by attending to the manner in which Nature teaches us to &s;peak, when en|gaged in real and earne&s;t di&s;cour&s;e with others. The following &s;entence exemplifies the <HI>&s;u&s;pending</HI> and the <HI>clo&s;ing</HI> pau&s;es:
<Q>Hope, the balm of life, &s;ooths us under every misfortune.</Q>
The fir&s;t and &s;econd pau&s;es are accompanied by an inflection of voice, that gives the hearer an expectation of &s;omething further to complete the &s;en&s;e: the inflection attending the third pau&s;e, &s;igni|fies that the &s;en&s;e is completed.</P>
<P>The preceding example is an illu&s;tration of the &s;u&s;|pending pau&s;e, in its &s;imple &s;tate: the following in&s;tance
<PB N="24" REF="038017_0024_1010D331F1E60088" MS="y">
exhibits that pau&s;e with a degree of cadence in the voice:
<Q>If content cannot remove the di&s;quietudes of mankind, it will at lea&s;t alleviate them.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;u&s;pending pau&s;e is often, in the &s;ame &s;entence, attended with both the ri&s;ing and the falling inflection of voice; as will be &s;een in this example:
<Q>Moderate ex|erci&s;e&spcgrave;, and habitual temperance&spcacute;, &s;trengthen the con|&s;titution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ri&s;ing inflection is denoted by the acute, the falling, by the grave accent.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>As the &s;u&s;pending pau&s;e may be thus attended with both the ri&s;ing and the falling inflection, it is the &s;ame with re|gard to the clo&s;ing pau&s;e: it admits of both. The falling inflection generally accompanies it; but it is not unfre|quently connected with the ri&s;ing inflection. Interroga|tive &s;entences, for in&s;tance, are often terminated in this manner: as, "Am I ungrateful&spcacute;?" "Is he in earne&s;t&spcacute;?"</P>
<P>But where a &s;entence is begun by an interrogative pro|noun or adverb, it is commonly terminated by the falling inflection: as, "What has he gained by his folly&spcgrave;?" "Who will a&s;&s;i&s;t him&spcgrave;?" "Where is the me&s;&s;enger&spcgrave;?" "When did he arrive&spcgrave;?"</P>
<P>Where two que&s;tions are united in one &s;entence, and connected by the conjunction <HI>or,</HI> the fir&s;t takes the ri&s;ing, the &s;econd the falling inflection: as,
<Q>Does his conduct &s;upport di&s;cipline&spcacute;, or de&s;troy it&spcgrave;?</Q></P>
<P>The ri&s;ing and falling inflections mu&s;t not be confound|ed with empha&s;is. Though they may often coincide, they are, in their nature, perfectly di&s;tinct. Empha&s;is &s;ometimes controls tho&s;e inflections.</P>
<P>The regular application of the ri&s;ing and falling in|flections, confers &s;o much beauty on expre&s;&s;ion, and is &s;o
<PB N="25" REF="038017_0025_1010D33521C7A8C8" MS="y">

<HEAD>SECTION VIII. Manner of reading Ver&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we are reading ver&s;e, there is a peculiar diffi|culty in making the pau&s;es ju&s;tly. The difficulty ari&s;es from the melody of ver&s;e, which dictates to the ear pau&s;es or re&s;ts of its own; and to adju&s;t and compound the&s;e properly with the pau&s;es of the &s;en&s;e, &s;o as neither to hurt the ear, nor offend the under&s;tanding, is &s;o very nice a matter, that it is no wonder we &s;o &s;eldom meet with good readers of poetry. There are two kinds of pau&s;es that belong to the melody of ver&s;e: one is, the pau&s;e at the end of the line; and the other, the cae&s;ural pau&s;e in or near the middle of it. With regard to the pau&s;e at the end of the line, which marks that &s;train or ver&s;e to be fini&s;hed, rhyme renders this always &s;en&s;ible; and in &s;ome mea&s;ure compels us to ob&s;erve it in our pronunciation. In re&s;pect to blank ver&s;e, we ought al&s;o to read it &s;o as to make every line &s;en&s;ible to the ear: for, what is the u&s;e of melody, or for what end has the poet compo&s;ed in ver&s;e, if, in reading his lines, we &s;uppre&s;s his numbers, by omit|ting the final pau&s;e; and degrade them, by our pronun|ciation, into mere pro&s;e? At the &s;ame time that we at|tend to this pau&s;e, every appearance of &s;ing-&s;ong and tone mu&s;t be carefully guarded again&s;t. The clo&s;e of the line, where it makes no pau&s;e in the meaning, ought not to be marked by &s;uch a tone as is u&s;ed in fini&s;hing a &s;en|tence; but, without either fall or elevation of the voice, it &s;hould be denoted only by &s;uch a &s;light &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of &s;ound, as may di&s;tingui&s;h the pa&s;&s;age from one line to ano|ther, without injuring the meaning.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="038017_0027_1010D33D5AA749B8" MS="y">The other kind of melodious pau&s;e, is that which falls &s;omewhere about the middle of the ver&s;e, and divides it into two hemi&s;tichs; a pau&s;e, not &s;o great as that which belongs to the clo&s;e of the line, but &s;till &s;en&s;ible to an or|dinary ear. This, which is called the cae&s;ural pau&s;e, may fall, in Engli&s;h heroic ver&s;e, after the 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th &s;yllables in the line. Where the ver&s;e is &s;o con&s;tructed, that this cae&s;ural pau&s;e coincides with the &s;lighte&s;t pau&s;e or divi&s;ion in the &s;en&s;e, the line can be read ea&s;ily; as in the two fir&s;t ver&s;es of Pope's Me&s;&s;iah:
<Q><L>"Ye nymphs of Solyma&spcacute;&spcacute;! begin the &s;ong;</L>
<L>"To heav'nly themes&spcacute;&spcacute;, &s;ublimer &s;trains belong."</L></Q>
But if it &s;hould happen that words which have &s;uch a &s;trict and intimate connexion, as not to bear even a mo|mentary &s;eparation, are divided from one another by this cae&s;ural pau&s;e, we then feel a &s;ort of &s;truggle between the &s;en&s;e and the &s;ound, which renders it difficult to read &s;uch lines harmoniou&s;ly. The rule of proper pronunciation in &s;uch ca&s;es, is to regard only the pau&s;e which the &s;en&s;e forms; and to read the line accordingly. The neglect of the cae&s;ural pau&s;e may make the line &s;ound &s;omewhat unharmoniou&s;ly; but the effect would be much wor&s;e, if the &s;en&s;e were &s;acrificed to the &s;ound. For in&s;tance, in the following line of Milton,
<Q><L>&mdash;"What in me is dark,</L>
<L>"Illumine; what is low, rai&s;e and &s;upport."</L></Q>
the &s;en&s;e clearly dictates the pau&s;e after <HI>illumine,</HI> at the end of the third &s;yllable, which, in reading, ought to be made accordingly; though, if the melody only were to be regarded, <HI>illumine</HI> &s;hould be connected with what follows, and the pau&s;e not made till the fourth or &s;ixth &s;yllable. So
<PB N="28" REF="038017_0028_1010D33F3AB45DB8" MS="y">
in the following line of Pope's Epi&s;tle to Dr. Arbuthnot,
<Q>"I &s;it, with &s;ad civility I read."</Q>
The ear plainly points out the cae&s;ural pau&s;e as falling af|ter <HI>&s;ad,</HI> the fourth &s;yllable. But it would be very bad reading to make any pau&s;e there, &s;o as to &s;eparate <HI>&s;ad</HI> and <HI>civility.</HI> The &s;en&s;e admits of no other pau&s;e than after the &s;econd &s;yllable <HI>&s;it,</HI> which therefore mu&s;t be the only pau&s;e made in reading this part of the &s;entence.</P>
<P>There is another mode of dividing &s;ome ver&s;es, by in|troducing what may be called demi-cae&s;uras, which re|quire very &s;light pau&s;es; and which the reader &s;hould manage with judgment, or he will be apt to fall into an affected &s;ing-&s;ong mode of pronouncing ver&s;es of this kind. The following lines exemplify the demi-cae&s;ura.</P>
<Q><L>"Warms&spcacute; in the &s;un&spcacute;&spcacute;, refre&s;hes&spcacute; in the breeze,</L>
<L>"Glows&spcacute; in the &s;tars&spcacute;&spcacute;, and blo&s;&s;oms&spcacute; in the trees;</L>
<L>"Lives&spcacute; through all life&spcacute;&spcacute;, extends&spcacute; through all extent,</L>
<L>"Spreads&spcacute; undivided&spcacute;&spcacute;, operates&spcacute; un&s;pent."</L></Q>
<P>Before the conclu&s;ion of this introduction, the Com|piler takes the liberty to recommend to tho&s;e teachers, who may favour his compilation, to exerci&s;e their pupils in di&s;covering and explaining the emphatic words, and the proper tones and pau&s;es, of every portion a&s;&s;igned them to read, previou&s;ly to their being called out to the performance. The&s;e preparatory le&s;&s;ons, in which they &s;hould be regularly examined, will improve their judg|ment and ta&s;te; prevent the practice of reading without attention to the &s;ubject; and e&s;tabli&s;h a habit of readily di&s;covering the meaning, force, and beauty, of every &s;en+tence they peru&s;e.</P>

<P>To be wi&s;e in our own eyes, to be wi&s;e in the opinion of the world, and to be wi&s;e in the &s;ight of our Creator, are three things &s;o very different, as rarely to coincide.</P>

<P>Virtue, to become either vigorous or u&s;eful, mu&s;t be ha|bitually active: not breaking forth occa&s;ionally with a tran&s;ient lu&s;tre, like the blaze of the comet; but regular in its returns, like the light of day: not like the aromatic gale, which &s;ometimes fea&s;ts the &s;en&s;e; but like the ordi|nary breeze, which purifies the air, and renders it healthful.</P>

<P>The &s;pirit of true religion breathes mildne&s;s and affa|bility. It gives a native, unaffected ea&s;e to the beha|viour.

<P>TIME once pa&s;t never returns: the moment which is lo&s;t, is lo&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>There is nothing on earth &s;o &s;table, as to a&s;&s;ure us of undi&s;turbed re&s;t; nor &s;o powerful, as to afford us con&s;tant protection.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of fea&s;ting too often becomes an avenue to the hou&s;e of mourning. Short, to the licentious, is the interval between them.</P>
<P>It is of great importance to us, to form a proper e&s;ti|mate of human life; without either loading it with im|aginary evils, or expecting from it greater advantages than it is able to yield.</P>
<P>Among all our corrupt pa&s;&s;ions, there is a &s;trong and intimate connexion. When any one of them is adopted into our family, it &s;eldom quits us until it has fathered upon us all its kindred.</P>
<P>Charity, like the &s;un, brightens every object on which it &s;hines: a cen&s;orious di&s;po&s;ition ca&s;ts every character into the darke&s;t &s;hade it will bear.</P>
<P>Many men mi&s;take the love, for the practice of virtue; and are not &s;o much good men, as the friends of goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Genuine virtue has a language that &s;peaks to every heart throughout the world. It is a language which is under&s;tood by all. In every region, every clime, the homage paid to it is the &s;ame. In no one &s;entiment were ever mankind more generally agreed.</P>
<P>The appearances of our &s;ecurity are frequently deceit|ful. When our &s;ky &s;eems mo&s;t &s;ettled and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rene, in &s;ome unob&s;erved quarter gathers the little black cloud, in

which the tempe&s;t ferments, and prepares to di&s;charge it|&s;elf on our head.</P>
<P>The man of true fortitude may be compared to the ca&s;tle built on a rock, which defies the attacks of &s;ur|rounding waters: the man of a feeble and timourous &s;pirit to a hut placed on the &s;hore, which every wind &s;hakes, and every wave overflows.</P>
<P>Nothing is &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as violent anger. It overpowers rea&s;on; confounds our ideas; di&s;torts the appearance, and blackens the appearance of every object. By the &s;torm which it rai&s;es within, and by the mi&s;chiefs which it occa&s;ions without, it generally brings on the pa&s;&s;ionate and revengeful man, greater mi&s;ery than he can bring on the object of his re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The palace of virtue has, in all ages, been repre&s;ented as placed on the &s;ummit of a hill; in the a&s;cent of which, labour is requi&s;ite, and difficulties are to be &s;urmounted; and where a conductor is needed, to direct our way, and to aid our &s;teps.</P>
<P>In judging of others, let us always think the be&s;t, and employ the &s;pirit of charity and candour. But in judg|ing of our&s;elves, we ought to be exact and &s;evere.</P>
<P>Let him that de&s;ires to &s;ee others happy, make ha&s;te to give while his gift can be enjoyed; and remember, that every moment of delay, takes away &s;omething from the value of his benefaction. And let him who propo&s;es his own happine&s;s reflect, that while he forms his purpo&s;e, the day rolls on, and "the night cometh when no man can work.</P>
<P>To &s;en&s;ual per&s;ons, hardly any thing is what it appears to be: and what flatters mo&s;t, is always farthe&s;t from the reality. There are voices which &s;ing around them; but

who&s;e &s;trains allure to ruin. There is a banquet &s;pread, where poi&s;on is in every di&s;h. There is a couch which invites to repo&s;e; but to &s;lumber upon it, is death.</P>
<P>If we would judge whether a man is really happy, it is not &s;olely to his hou&s;es and lands, to his equipage and his retinue, we are to look. Unle&s;s we could &s;ee farther, and di&s;cern what joy, or what bitterne&s;s, his heart feels, we can pronounce nothing concerning him.</P>
<P>The book is well written; and I have peru&s;ed it with plea&s;ure and profit.

<P>There is certainly no greater felicity, than to be able to look back on a life u&s;efully and virtuou&s;ly employed; to trace our own progre&s;s in exi&s;tence, by &s;uch tokens as excite neither &s;hame nor &s;orrow.

It is within our&s;elves that mi&s;ery has fixed its &s;eat.

<HEAD>SECTION I. No Rank or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions can make the guilty Mind happy.</HEAD>
<P>DIONYSIUS, the tyrant Sicily, was far from being happy, though he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great riches, and all the plea|&s;ures which wealth and power could procure. Damocles, one of his flatterers, deceived by the&s;e &s;pecious appear|ances of happine&s;s, took occa&s;ion to compliment him on the extent of his power, his trea&s;ures, and royal magnificence; and declared that no monarch had ever been greater or happier than Diony&s;ius. "Ha&s;t thou a mind, Damocles," &s;ays the King, "to ta&s;te this happi|ne&s;s; and to know, by experience, what the enjoyments are, of which thou ha&s;t &s;o high an idea?" Damocles, with joy, accepted the offer. The King ordered that a royal banquet &s;hould be prepared, and a gilded &s;ofa, cover|ed with rich embroidery, placed for his favourite. Side|boards, loaded with gold and &s;ilver plate of immen&s;e value, were arranged in the apartment. Pages of extraordinary beauty were ordered to attend his table, and to obey his commands with the utmo&s;t readine&s;s, and the mo&s;t pro|found &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Fragrant ointments, chaplets of flow|ers, and rich perfumes, were added to the entertainment. The table was loaded with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite delicacies of every kind. Damocles, intoxicated with plea&s;ure,
<PB N="62" REF="038017_0062_1010D3A9DDC9EA60" MS="y">
fancied him&s;elf among&s;t &s;uperior beings. But in the mid&s;t of all this happine&s;s, as he lay indulging him&s;elf in &s;tate, he &s;ees let down from the ceiling, exactly over his head, a glittering &s;word hung by a &s;ingle hair. The &s;ight of impending de&s;truction put a &s;peedy end to his joy and revelling. The pomp of his attendance, the glitter of the carved plate, and the delicacy of the viands, cea&s;e to afford him any plea&s;ure. He dreads to &s;tretch forth his hand to the table. He throws off the garland of ro&s;es. He ha&s;tens to remove from his dangerous &s;itu|ation; and earne&s;tly entreats the king to re&s;tore him to his former humble condition, having no de&s;ire to enjoy any longer a happine&s;s &s;o terrible.</P>
<P>By this device, Diony&s;ius intimated to Damocles, how mi&s;erable he was in the mid&s;t of all his trea&s;ures; and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the honours and enjoyments which royal|ty could be&s;tow.</P>

<P>IN the days of Joram, King of I&s;rael, flouri&s;hed the prophet Eli&s;ha. His character was &s;o eminent, and his fame &s;o widely &s;pread, that Benhadad the King of Syria, though an idolater, &s;ent to con&s;ult him, concerning the i&s;&s;ue of a di&s;temper which threatened his life. The me&s;|&s;enger employed on this occa&s;ion was Hazael, who ap|pears to have been one of the princes, or chief men, of the Syrian court. Charged with rich gifts from the king, he pre&s;ents him&s;elf before the prophet; and acco&s;ts him in terms of the highe&s;t re&s;pect. During the conference which they held together, Eli&s;ha fixed his eye &s;tedfa&s;tly
<PB N="63" REF="038017_0063_1010D3AB6BB98310" MS="y">
on the countenance of Hazael; and di&s;cerning, by a pro|phetic &s;pirit, his future tyranny and cruelty, he could not contain him&s;elf from bur&s;ting into a flood of tears. When Hazael, in &s;urpri&s;e, inquired into the cau&s;e of this &s;udden emotion, the prophet plainly informed him of the crimes and barbarities, which he fore&s;aw that he would after|wards commit. The &s;oul of Hazael abhorred, at this time, the thoughts of cruelty. Uncorrupted, as yet, by ambition or greatne&s;s, his indignation ro&s;e at being thought capable of &s;uch &s;avage actions, as the prophet had men|tioned; and, with much warmth, he replies: "But what? is thy &s;ervant a dog, that he &s;hould do this great thing?" Eli&s;ha makes no return, but to point out a re|markable change, which was to take place in his condi|tion; "The Lord hath &s;hown me that thou &s;halt be king over Syria." In cour&s;e of time, all that had been predicted came to pa&s;s. Hazael a&s;cended the throne, and ambition took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart. "He &s;mote the children of I&s;rael in all their coa&s;ts. He oppre&s;&s;ed them during all the days of king Jehoahaz:" and, from what is left on record of his actions, he plainly appears to have proved, what the prophet fore&s;aw him to be, a man of violence, cruelty, and blood.</P>
<P>In this pa&s;&s;age of hi&s;tory, an object is pre&s;ented, which de&s;erves our &s;erious attention.

<HEAD>SECTION III. <HI>HAMAN;</HI> or, the Mi&s;ery of Pride.</HEAD>
<P>AHASUERUS, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the prince known among the Greek hi&s;torians by the name of Artaxerxes, had advanced to the chief dignity in his kingdom, Haman, an Amalekite, who inherited all the ancient enmity of his race to the Jewi&s;h nation. He appears, from what is recorded of him, to have been a very wicked mini&s;ter. Rai&s;ed to greatne&s;s without merit, he employed his pow|er &s;olely for the gratification of his pa&s;&s;ions. As the ho|nours which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed were next to royal, his pride was every day fed with that &s;ervile homage, which is pe|culiar to A&s;iatic courts; and all the &s;ervants of the king pro&s;trated them&s;elves before him. In the mid&s;t of this general adulation, one per&s;on only &s;tooped not to Haman. This was Mordecai the Jew; who, knowing this Am|alekite to be an enemy to the people of God, and, with virtuous indignation, de&s;pi&s;ing that in&s;olence of pro&s;peri|ty with which he &s;aw him lifted up, "bowed not, nor did him reverence." On this appearance of di&s;re&s;pect from Mordecai, Haman "was full of wrath: but he thought &s;corn to lay hands on Mordecai alone." Per&s;onal revenge was not &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy him. So violent and black were his pa&s;&s;ions, that he re&s;olved to exterminate the whole nation to which Mordecai belonged.

&s;hould be put to the &s;word. Meanwhile, confi|dent of &s;ucce&s;s, and blind to approaching ruin, he continu|ed exulting in his pro&s;perity. Invited by Aha&s;uerus to a royal banquet, which E&s;ther the queen had prepared, "he went forth that day joyful, and with a glad heart." But behold how &s;light an incident was &s;ufficient to poi|&s;on his joy! As he went forth, he &s;aw Mordecai in the king's gate; and ob&s;erved, that he &s;till refu&s;ed to do him homage: "He &s;tood not up, nor was moved for him;" although he well knew the formidable de&s;igns, which Ha|man was preparing to execute. One private man, who de&s;pi&s;ed his greatne&s;s, and di&s;dained &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, while a whole kingdom trembled before him; one &s;pirit, which the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of his power could neither &s;ubdue nor humble, bla&s;ted his triumphs. His whole &s;oul was &s;hak|en with a &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ion. Wrath, pride, and de&s;ire of revenge, ro&s;e into fury. With difficulty he re&s;trained him&s;elf in public; but as &s;oon as he came to his own hou&s;e, he was forced to di&s;clo&s;e the agony of his mind. He gathered together his friends and family, with Zere&s;h his wife. "He told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and of all the things wherein the king had promoted him; and how he had advanced him above the princes and &s;ervants of the king. He &s;aid, moreover, Yea, E&s;ther the queen &s;uffered no man to come in with the king, to the banquet that &s;he had prepared, but my&s;elf; and to-morrow al&s;o am I in|vited to her with the king." After all this preamble, what is the conclu&s;ion?&mdash;"Yet all this availeth me no|thing, &s;o long as I &s;ee Mordecai the Jew &s;itting at the king's gate."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. <HI>ORTOGRUL;</HI> or, the Vanity of Riches,</HEAD>
<P>AS Ortogrul of Ba&s;ra was one day wandering along the &s;treets of Bagdat, mu&s;ing on the varieties of mer|chandi&s;e which the &s;hops offered to his view; and ob|&s;erving the different occupations which bu&s;ied the mul|titudes on every &s;ide, he was awakened from the tranquili|ty of meditation, by a crowd that ob&s;tru&s;ted his pa&s;&s;age. He rai&s;ed his eyes, and &s;aw the chief vizier, who, having returned from the divan, was entering his palace.</P>
<P>Ortogrul mingled with the attendants; and being &s;up|po&s;ed to have &s;ome petition for the vizier, was permitted to enter. He &s;urveyed the &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s of the apart|ments, admired the walls hung with golden tape&s;try, and the floors covered with &s;ilken carpets; and de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;imple neatne&s;s of his own little habitation.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="038017_0067_1010D3B9F0666568">"Surely," &s;aid he to him&s;elf "this palace is the &s;eat of happine&s;s; where plea&s;ure &s;ucceeds to plea&s;ure, and di&s;|content and &s;orrow can have no admi&s;&s;ion. Whatever na|ture has provided for the delight of &s;en&s;e, is here &s;pread forth to be enjoyed. What can mortals hope or imagine, which the ma&s;ter of this palace has not obtained? The di&s;hes of luxury cover his table; the voice of harmony lulls him in his bowers; he breathes the fragrance of the groves of Java, and &s;leeps upon the down of the cygnets of Ganges. He &s;peaks, and his mandate is obeyed; he wi&s;hes, and his wi&s;h is gratified; all whom he &s;ees obey him, and all whom he hears flatter him. How different, Ortogrul, is thy condition, who art doomed to the per|petual torments of un&s;atisfied de&s;ire; and who ha&s;t no amu&s;ement in thy power, that can withhold thee from thy own reflections! They tell thee that thou art wi&s;e; but what does wi&s;dom avail with poverty? None will flatter the poor; and the wi&s;e have very little power of &s;latter|ing them&s;elves. That man is &s;urely the mo&s;t wretched of the &s;ons of wretchedne&s;s, who lives with his own faults and follies always before him; and who has none to recon|cile him to him&s;elf by prai&s;e and veneration. I have long &s;ought content, and have not found it; I will from this moment endeavour to be rich."</P>
<P>Full of this new re&s;olution, he &s;hut him&s;elf in his cham|ber for &s;ix months, to deliberate how he &s;hould grow rich. He &s;ometimes purpo&s;ed to offer him&s;elf as a coun&s;ellor to one of the kings of India; and &s;ometimes re&s;olved to dig for diamond in the mines of Golconda.

might teach him to grow rich; and as he &s;tood on the top of a hill, &s;haded with cypre&s;s, in doubt whither to direct his &s;teps, his father appeared on a &s;udden &s;tanding before him. "Ortogrul," &s;aid the old man, "I know thy per|plexity; li&s;ten to thy father; turn thine eye to the oppo|&s;ite mountain." Ortogrul looked, and &s;aw a torrent tumbling down the racks, roaring with the noi&s;e of thun|der, and &s;cattering its foam on the impending woods. "Now," &s;aid his father, "behold the valley that lies be|tween the hills." Ortogrul looked, and e&s;pied a little well, out of which i&s;&s;ued a &s;mall rivulet. "Tell me now," &s;aid his father, "do&s;t thou wi&s;h for &s;udden affluence, that may pour upon thee like the mountain-torrent; or for a &s;low and gradual increa&s;e, re&s;embling the rill gliding from the well? "Let me be quickly rich," &s;aid Ortogrul; "let the golden &s;tream be quick and violent." "Look round thee," &s;aid his father, "once again." Ortogrul looked, and perceived the channel of the torrent dry and du&s;ty; but following the rivulet from the well, he traced it to a wide lake, which the &s;upply, &s;low and con&s;tant, kept always full. He awoke, and determined to grow rich, by &s;ilent profit, and per&s;evering indu&s;try.</P>
<P>Having &s;old his patrimony, he engaged in merchandi&s;e; and in twenty years purcha&s;ed lands, on which he rai&s;ed a hou&s;e, equal in &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s to that of the vizier, to which he invited all the mini&s;ters of Plea&s;ure, expecting to enjoy all the felicity which he had imagined riches able to afford. Lei&s;ure &s;oon made him weary of him&s;elf, and he longed to be per&s;uaded that he was great and happy.

Ortogrul heard his flatterers without delight, becau&s;e he found him&s;elf unable to believe them. His own heart told him its frailties; his own under&s;tanding reproached him with its faults. "How long," &s;aid he, with a deep &s;igh, "have I been labouring in vain to ama&s;s wealth, which at la&s;t is u&s;ele&s;s!

<HEAD>SECTION V. LADY JANE GREY.</HEAD>
<P>This excellent per&s;onage was de&s;cended from the Roy|al Line of England by both her parents.</P>
<P>She was carefully educated in the principles of the Reformation; and her wi&s;dom and virtue rendered her a &s;hining example to her &s;ex. But it was her lot to con|tinue only a &s;hort period on this &s;tage of being; for, in early life, &s;he fell a &s;acrifice to the wild ambition of the Duke of Northumberland; who promoted a marriage between her and his &s;on, Lord Guilford Dudley; and rai&s;ed her to the throne of England, in oppo&s;ition to the rights of Mary and Elizabeth. At the time of their marriage, &s;he was only about eighteen years of age, and her hu&s;band was al&s;o very young: a &s;ea&s;on of life very unequal to oppo&s;e the intere&s;ted views of artful and a&s;|piring men; who, in&s;tead of expo&s;ing them to danger, &s;hould have been the protectors of their innocence and youth.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="038017_0070_1010D3C288E8F5C8">This extraordinary young per&s;on, be&s;ides the &s;olid en|dowments of piety and virtue, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t engaging di&s;po&s;ition, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed parts; and being of an equal age with King Edward VI, &s;he had received all her education with him, and &s;eemed even to po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater facility in acquiring every part of manly and cla&s;&s;i|cal literature. She had attained a knowledge of the Ro|man and Greek languages, as well as of &s;everal modern tongues; had pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of her time in an application to learning; and expre&s;&s;ed a great indifference for other oc|cupations and amu&s;ements u&s;ual with her &s;ex and &s;tation. Roger A&s;cham, tutor to the Lady Elizabeth, having at one time paid her a vi&s;it, found her employed in reading Plato, while the re&s;t of the family were engaged in a party of hunting in the park; and upon his admiring the &s;in|gularity of her choice, &s;he told him, that &s;he "received more plea&s;ure from that author, than the others could reap from all their &s;port and gaiety."&mdash;Her heart, replete with this love of literature and &s;erious &s;tudies, and with ten|derne&s;s towards her hu&s;band, who was de&s;erving of her affection, had never opened it&s;elf to the flattering allure|ments of ambition; and the information of her advance|ment to the throne was by no means agreeable to her. She even refu&s;ed to accept of the crown; pleaded the pre|ferable right of the two prince&s;&s;es; expre&s;&s;ed her dread of the con&s;equences attending an enterpi&s;e &s;o dangerous, not to &s;ay &s;o criminal; and de&s;ired to remain in that pri|vate &s;tation in which &s;he was born. Overcome at la&s;t with the entreaties, rather than rea&s;ons, of her father and father-in-law, and above all, of her hu&s;band, &s;he &s;ubmit|ted to their will, and was prevailed on to relinqui&s;h her

own judgment. But this honour was of very &s;hort con|tinuance. The nation declared for Queen Mary; and the Lady Jane, after wearing the vain pageantry of a crown during ten days, returned to a private life, with much more &s;atisfaction than &s;he felt when the royalty was ten|dered to her.</P>
<P>Queen Mary, who appears to have been incapable of genero&s;ity or clemency, determined to remove every per|&s;on, from whom the lea&s;t danger could be apprehended. Warning was, therefore, given the Lady Jane to prepare for death; a doom which &s;he had expected, and which the innocence of her life, as well as the misfortunes to which &s;he had been expo&s;ed, rendered no unwelcome news to her. The Queen's bigotted zeal, under colour of tender mercy to the pri&s;oner's &s;oul, induced her to &s;end prie&s;ts, who mole&s;ted her with perpetual di&s;putation; and even a reprieve of three days was granted her, in hopes that &s;he would be per&s;uaded, during that time, to pay, by a timely conver&s;ion to Popery, &s;ome regard to her eternal welfare. The Lady Jane had pre&s;ence of mind, in tho&s;e melancholy circum&s;tances, not only to defend her religion by &s;olid arguments, but al&s;o to write a letter to her &s;i&s;ter, in the Greek language; in which, be&s;ides &s;ending her a copy of the Scriptures in that tongue, &s;he exhorted her to maintain, in every fortune, a like &s;teady per&s;everance. On the day of her execution, her hu&s;band, Lord Guil|ford, de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee her; but &s;he refu&s;ed her con&s;ent, and &s;ent him word, that the tenderne&s;s of their parting would overcome the fortitude of both; and would too much unbend their minds from that con&s;tancy, which their approaching end required of them.&mdash;Their &s;epara|tion, &s;he &s;aid, would be only for a moment; and they

would &s;oon rejoin each other in a &s;cene, where their af|fections would be for ever united; and where death, di&s;|appointment&punc; and misfortunes, could no longer have acce&s;s to them, or di&s;turb their eternal felicity.</P>
<P>It had been intended to execute the Lady Jane and Lord Guilford together on the &s;ame &s;caffold, at Tower|hill; but the council, dreading the compa&s;&s;ion of the people for their youth, beauty, innocence, and noble birth, changed their orders, and gave directions that &s;he &s;hould be beheaded within the verge of the Tower. She &s;aw her hu&s;band led to execution; and having given him from the window &s;ome token of her remembrance, &s;he waited with tranquility till her own appointed hour &s;hould bring her to a like fate. She even &s;aw his head|le&s;s body carried back in a cart; and found her&s;elf more confirmed by the reports, which &s;he heard of the con&s;tan|cy of his end, than &s;haken by &s;o tender and melancholy a &s;pectacle. Sir John Gage, con&s;table of the Tower, when he led her to execution, de&s;ired her to be&s;tow on him &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ent, which he might keep as a per|petual memorial of her. She gave him her table-book, in which &s;he had ju&s;t written three &s;entences, on &s;eeing her hu&s;band's dead body; one in Greek, another in Latin, a third in Engli&s;h. The purport of them was, "that human ju&s;tice was again&s;t his body, but the Divine Mer|cy would be favourable to his &s;oul: and that if her fault de&s;erved puni&s;hment, her youth, at lea&s;t, and her impru|dence, were worthy of excu&s;e; and that God and po&s;terity, &s;he tru&s;ted, would &s;how her favour." On the &s;caffold, &s;he made a &s;peech to the bye-&s;tanders, in which the mildne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition led her to take the blame entirely on her&s;elf, without uttering one complaint

again&s;t the &s;everity with which &s;he had been treated. She &s;aid, that her offence was, not having laid her hand upon the crown, but not rejecting it with &s;ufficient con|&s;tancy: that &s;he had le&s;s erred through ambition than through reverence to her parents, whom &s;he had been taught to re&s;pect and obey: that &s;he willingly received death, as the only &s;atisfaction which &s;he could now make to the injured &s;tate; and though her infringement of the laws had been con&s;trained, &s;he would &s;hew, by her volun|tary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their &s;entence, that &s;he was de&s;irous to atone for that di&s;obedience, into which too much filial piety had betrayed her&punc; that &s;he had ju&s;tly de&s;erved this puni&s;hment for being made the in&s;trument, though the unwilling in&s;trument, of the ambition of others: and that the &s;tory of her life, &s;he hoped, might at lea&s;t be u&s;eful, by proving that innocence excu&s;es not great mi&s;|deeds, if they tend any way to the de&s;truction of the commonwealth.&mdash;After uttering the&s;e words, &s;he cau&s;ed her&s;elf to be di&s;robed by her women, and with a &s;teady, &s;erene countenance &s;ubmitted her&s;elf to the execu|tioner.</P>

benevolence, and di&s;po&s;e it for contemplation, I was wan|dering in a beautiful and romantic country, till curio&s;ity began to give way to wearine&s;s; and I &s;at down on the fragment of a rock overgrown with mo&s;s; where the ru&s;tling of the falling leaves, the da&s;hing of waters, and the hum of the di&s;tant city, &s;oothed my mind into the mo&s;t perfect tranquility; and &s;leep in&s;en&s;ibly &s;tole upon me, as I was indulging the agreeable reveries, which the objects around me naturally in&s;pired.</P>
<P>I immediately found my&s;elf in a va&s;t extended plain, in the middle of which aro&s;e a mountain higher than I had before any conception of. It was covered with a multitude of people, chiefly youth; many of whom pre&s;&s;|ed forwards with the livelie&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of ardour in their countenance, though the way was in many places &s;teep and difficult. I ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e who had but ju&s;t begun to climb the hill, thought them&s;elves not far from the top; but as they proceeded, new hills were continually ri&s;ing to their view; and the &s;ummit of the highe&s;t they could before di&s;cern &s;eemed but the foot of another, till the mountain at length appeared to lo&s;e it|&s;elf in the clouds. As I was gazing on the&s;e things with a&s;toni&s;hment, a friendly in&s;tructor &s;uddenly appeared: "The mountain before thee," &s;aid he, "is the Hill of Science. On the top is the temple of Truth, who&s;e head is above the clouds, and a veil of pure light covers her face. Ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of her votaries; be &s;i|lent and attentive."</P>
<P>After I had noticed a variety of objects, I turned my eye towards the multitudes who were climbing the &s;teep a&s;cent; and ob&s;erved among&s;t them a youth of a lively look, a piercing eye, and &s;omething fiery and irregular

in all his motions. His name was Genius. He dart|ed like an eagle up to the mountain; and left his com|panions gazing after him with envy and admiration: but his progre&s;s was unequal, and interrupted by a thou&s;and caprices. When Plea&s;ure warbled in the valley, he min|gled in her train. When Pride beckoned towards the precipice, he ventured to the tottering edge. He delight|ed in devious and untried paths; and made &s;o many ex|cur&s;ions from the road, that his feebler companions often out&s;tripped him. I ob&s;erved that the Mu&s;es beheld him with partiality; but Truth often frowned, and turned a&s;ide her face. While Genius was thus wa&s;ting his &s;trength in eccentric flights; I &s;aw a per&s;on of a very dif|ferent appearance, named Application. He crept along with a &s;low and unremitting pace; his eyes fixed on the top of the mountain, patiently removing every &s;tone that ob&s;tructed his way, till he &s;aw mo&s;t of tho&s;e below him, who had at fir&s;t derided his &s;low and toil&s;ome progre&s;s. Indeed, there were few who a&s;cended the hill with equal, and uninterrupted &s;teadine&s;s; for be&s;ide the difficulties of the way, they were continually &s;olicited to turn a&s;ide, by a numerous crowd of Appetites, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Plea&s;ures, who&s;e importunity, when once complied with, they be|came le&s;s and le&s;s able to re&s;i&s;t: and though they often returned to the path, the a&s;perities of the road were more &s;everely felt; the hill appeared more &s;teep and rugged; the fruits which were whole&s;ome and refre&s;hing, &s;eemed har&s;h and ill-ta&s;ted; their &s;ight grew dim; and their feet tript at every little ob&s;truction.</P>
<P>I &s;aw, with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, that the Mu&s;es, who&s;e bu&s;i|ne&s;s was to cheer and encourage tho&s;e who were toiling

up the a&s;cent, would often &s;ing in the bowers of Plea&s;ure, and accompany tho&s;e who were enticed away at the call of the Pa&s;&s;ions. They accompanied them, however, but a little way; and always for&s;ook them when they lo&s;t &s;ight of the hill. The tyrants then doubled their chains upon the unhappy captives; and led them away, without re&s;i&s;tance, to the cells of Ignorance, or the man&s;ions of Mi&s;ery. Among&s;t the innumerable &s;educers, who were endeavouring to draw away the votaries of Truth from the path of Science, there was one, &s;o little formidable in her appearance, and &s;o gentle and languid in her at|tempts, that I &s;hould &s;carcely have taken notice of her, but for the numbers &s;he had imperceptibly loaded with her chains. Indolence, (for &s;o &s;he was called,) far from proceeding to open ho&s;tilities, did not attempt to turn their feet out of the path, but contented her&s;elf with re|tarding their progre&s;s; and the purpo&s;e &s;he could not force them to abandon, &s;he per&s;uaded them to delay. Her touch had a power like that of the torpedo, which with|ered the &s;trength of tho&s;e who came within its influence. Her unhappy captives &s;till turned their faces towards the temple, and always hoped to arrive there; but the ground &s;eemed to &s;lide from beneath their feet, and they found them&s;elves at the bottom, before they &s;u&s;pected they had changed their place. The placid &s;erenity, which at fir&s;t appeared in their countenance, changed by degrees into a melancholy languor, which was tinged with deeper and deeper gloom, as they glided down the &s;tream of In&s;ig|nificance; a dark and &s;luggi&s;h water, which is curled by no breeze, and enlivened by no murmur, till it falls into a dead &s;ea, where &s;tartled pa&s;&s;engers are awakened by the &s;hock, and the next moment buried in the gulph of Oblivion.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="038017_0077_1010D3D85ADCF7E8">Of all the unhappy de&s;erters from the paths of Science, none &s;eemed le&s;s able to return than the followers of In|dolence.

<P>After contemplating the&s;e things, I turned my eyes towards the top of the mountain, where the air was al|ways pure and exhilirating, the path &s;haded with laurels and ever-greens, and the effulgence which beamed from the face of Science &s;eemed to &s;hed a glory round her vo|taries. Happy, &s;aid I, are they who are permitted to a&s;|cend the mountain!&mdash;But while I was pronouncing this exclamation with uncommon ardour, I &s;aw, &s;tanding be|&s;ide me, a form of diviner features, and a more benign radiance. "Happier," &s;aid &s;he, "are they whom Vir|tue conducts to the man&s;ions of Content!" "What," &s;aid I, "does Virtue then re&s;ide in the vale?" "I am found," &s;aid &s;he, "in the vale, and I illuminate the moun|tain. I cheer the cottager at his toil, and in&s;pire the &s;age at his meditation.

<HEAD>SECTION VII. The Journey of a day; a Picture of Human Life.</HEAD>
<P>OBIDAH, the &s;on of Aben&s;ina, left the caravan&s;era early in the morning, and pur&s;ued his journey through the plains of Indo&s;tan. He was fre&s;h and vigorous with re&s;t; he was animated with hope; he was incited by de|&s;ire; he walked &s;wiftly forward over the vallies, and &s;aw the hills gradually ri&s;ing before him. As he pa&s;&s;ed along, his ears were delighted with the morning &s;ong of the bird of paradi&s;e; he was fanned by the la&s;t flutters of the &s;inking breeze, and &s;prinkled with dew by groves of &s;pices. He &s;ometimes contemplated the towering height of the oak, monarch of the hills; and &s;ometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the primro&s;e, elde&s;t daughter of the &s;pring: all his &s;en&s;es were gratified, and all care was bani&s;hed from his heart.</P>
<P>Thus he went on, till the &s;un approached his meri|dian, and the increa&s;ing heat preyed upon his &s;trength; he then looked round about him for &s;ome more com|modious path. He &s;aw, on his right hand, a grove that &s;eemed to wave its &s;hades as a &s;ign of invitation; he entered it, and found the coolne&s;s and verdure ir|re&s;i&s;tably plea&s;ant. He did not, however, forget whither he was travelling; but found a narrow way bordered with flowers, which appeared to have the &s;ame direction with the main road; and was plea&s;ed, that, by this happy experiment, he had found means to unite plea&s;ure with bu&s;ine&s;s, and to gain the rewards of diligence without &s;uffering its fatigues. He, there|fore, &s;till continued to walk for a time, without the lea&s;t remi&s;&s;ion of his ardour, except that he was &s;ome|times
<PB N="79" REF="038017_0079_1010D3DE850D03B8">
tempted to &s;top by the mu&s;ic of the birds, which the heat had a&s;&s;embled in the &s;hade; and &s;ometimes a|mu&s;ed him&s;elf with plucking the flowers that covered the banks on either &s;ide, or the fruits that hung upon the branches. At la&s;t, the green path began to decline from its fir&s;t tendency, and to wind among hills and thickets, cool|ed with fountains, and murmuring with water-falls. Here Obidah pau&s;ed for a time, and began to con&s;ider whether it were longer &s;afe to for&s;ake the known and common track; but remembering that the heat was now in its greate&s;t violence, and that the plain was du&s;ty and un|even, he re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the new path, which he &s;up|po&s;ed only to make a few meanders, in compliance with the varieties of the ground, and to end at la&s;t in the com|mon road.</P>
<P>Having thus calmed his &s;olicitude, he renewed his pace, though he &s;u&s;pected that he was not gaining ground. This unea&s;ine&s;s of his mind inclined him to lay hold on every new object, and give way to every &s;en&s;ation that might &s;ooth or divert him. He li&s;tened to every echo; he mounted every hill for a fre&s;h pro&s;pect; he turned a|&s;ide to every ca&s;cade; and plea&s;ed him&s;elf with tracing the cour&s;e of a gentle river that rolled among the trees, and watered a large region with innumerable circumvolu|tions. In the&s;e amu&s;ements, the hours pa&s;&s;ed away unac|counted; his deviations had perplexed his memory, and he knew not towards what point to travel. He &s;tood pen&s;ive and confu&s;ed, afraid to go forward le&s;t he &s;hould go wrong, yet con&s;cious that the time of loitering was now pa&s;t. While he was thus tortured with uncertainty, the &s;ky was over&s;pread with clouds; the day vani&s;hed from be|fore him; and a &s;udden tempe&s;t gathered round his head.
<PB N="80" REF="038017_0080_1010D3E19788B438">
He was now rou&s;ed by his danger to a quick and painful remembrance of his folly; he now &s;aw how happine&s;s is lo&s;t when ea&s;e is con&s;ulted; he lamented the unmanly impatience that prompted him to &s;eek &s;helter in the grove; and de&s;pi&s;ed the petty curio&s;ity that led him on from trifle to trifle. While he was thus reflecting, the air grew blacker, and a clap of thunder broke his meditation.</P>
<P>He now re&s;olved to do what yet remained in his pow|er, to tread back the ground which he had pa&s;&s;ed, and try to find &s;ome i&s;&s;ue where the wood might open into the plain. He pro&s;trated him&s;elf on the ground, and com|mended his life to the Lord of Nature. He ro&s;e with confidence and tranquility, and pre&s;&s;ed on with re&s;olution. The bea&s;ts of the de&s;ert were in motion, and on every hand were heard the mingled howls of rage and fear, and ravage and expiration. All the horrors of darkne&s;s and &s;olitude &s;urrounded him: the winds roared in the woods: and the torrents tumbled from the hills.</P>
<P>Thus forlorn and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, he wandered through the wild, without knowing whither he was going, or whether he was every moment drawing nearer to &s;afety or to de|&s;truction. At length, not fear, but labour began to over|come him; his breath grew &s;hort, and his knees trem|bled; and he was on the point of lying down in re&s;igna|tion to his fate, when he beheld, through the brambles, the glimmer of a taper. He advanced towards the light; and finding that it proceeded from the cottage of a her|mit, he called humbly at the door, and obtained admi&s;&s;ion. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d man &s;et before him &s;uch provi&s;ions as he had collected for him&s;elf, on which Obidah &s;ed with eagerne&s;s and gratitude.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="038017_0081_1010D3E6B7FF4038">When the repa&s;t was over, "Tell me," &s;aid the her|mit, "by what chance thou ha&s;t been brought hither? I have been now twenty years an inhabitant of the wil|derne&s;s, in which I never &s;aw a man before."&mdash;Obidah then related the occurrences of his journey, without any concealment or palliation.</P>
<P>"Son, &s;aid the hermit, "let the errors and follies, the dangers and e&s;cape of this day, &s;ink deep into thy heart. Remember, my &s;on, that human life is the journey of a day. We ri&s;e in the morning of youth, full of vigour and full of expectation; we &s;et forward with &s;pirit and hope, with gaiety and with diligence, and travel on a while in the direct road of piety towards the man&s;ions of re&s;t. In a &s;hort time, we remit our fervour, and endea|vour to find &s;ome mitigation of our duty, and &s;ome more ea&s;y means of obtaining the &s;ame end. We then relax our vigour, and re&s;olve no longer to be terrified with crimes at a di&s;tance; but rely upon our own con&s;tancy, and venture to approach what we re&s;olve never to touch. We thus enter the bowers of ea&s;e, and repo&s;e in the &s;hades of &s;ecurity. Here the heart &s;oftens, and vigilance &s;ub&s;ides; we are then willing to enquire whether ano|ther advance cannot be made, and whether we may not, at lea&s;t, turn our eyes upon the gardens of plea&s;ure. We approach them with &s;cruple and he&s;itation; we enter them, but enter timorous and trembling; and always hope to pa&s;s through them without lo&s;ing the road of virtue, which, for a while, we keep in our &s;ight, and to which we purpo&s;e to return. But temptation &s;ucceeds tempta|tion, and one compliance prepares us for another; we in time lo&s;e the happine&s;s of innocence, and &s;olace our

di&s;quiet with &s;en&s;ual gratifications. By degrees, we let fall the remembrance of our original intention, and quit the only adequate object of rational de&s;ire. We entan|gle our&s;elves in bu&s;ine&s;s, immerge our&s;elves in luxury, and rove through the labyrinths of incon&s;tancy; till the darkne&s;s of old age begins to invade us, and di&s;ea&s;e and anxiety ob&s;truct our way. We then look back upon our lives with horror, with &s;orrow, with repentance; and wi&s;h, but too often vainly wi&s;h, that we had not for&s;aken the ways of virtue. Happy are they, my &s;on, who &s;hall learn from thy example, not to de&s;pair; but &s;hall remember, that, though the day is pa&s;t, and their &s;trength is wa&s;ted, there yet remains one effort to be made: that reforma|tion is never hopele&s;s, nor &s;incere endeavours ever un|a&s;&s;i&s;ted: that the wanderer may at length return after all his errors; and that he who implores &s;trength and cou|rage from above, &s;hall find danger and difficulty give way before him. Go now, my &s;on, to thy repo&s;e; commit thy&s;elf to the care of Omnipotence; and when the morning calls again to toil, begin anew thy journey and thy life."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. The Importance of a good Education.</HEAD>
<P>I CONSIDER a human &s;oul, without education, like marble in the quarry; which &s;hows none of its inherent beauties, until the &s;kill of the poli&s;her fetches out the colours, makes the &s;urface &s;hine, and di&s;covers every or|namental cloud, &s;pot, and vein, that runs through the bo|dy of it. Education, after the &s;ame manner, when it works upon a noble mind, draws out to view every latent virtue and perfection, which, without &s;uch helps, are never able to make their appearance.</P>
<P>If my reader will give me leave to change the allu&s;ion &s;o &s;oon upon him, I &s;hall make u&s;e of the &s;ame in&s;tance to illu&s;trate the force of education, which Ari&s;totle has brought to explain his doctrine of &s;ub&s;tantial forms, when he tells us, that a &s;tatue lies hid in a block of marble; and that the art of the &s;tatuary only clears away the &s;uper|fluous matter, and removes the rubbi&s;h. The figure is in the &s;tone, and the &s;culptor only finds it. What &s;culp|ture is to a block of marble, education is to a human &s;oul. The philo&s;opher, the &s;aint, or the hero, the wi&s;e, the good, or the great man, very often lies hid and con|cealed in a plebeian, which a proper education might have di&s;interred, and have brought to light. I am therefore

much delighted with reading the accounts of &s;avage na|tions; and with contemplating tho&s;e virtues which are wild and uncultivated: to &s;ee courage exerting it&s;elf in fiercene&s;s, re&s;olution in ob&s;tinacy, wi&s;dom in cunning, patience in &s;ullenne&s;s and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Men's pa&s;&s;ions operate variou&s;ly, and appear in differ|ent kinds of actions, according as they are more or le&s;s rectified and &s;wayed by rea&s;on. When one hears of ne|groes, who, upon the death of their ma&s;ters, or upon changing their &s;ervice, hang them&s;elves upon the next tree, as it &s;ometimes happens in our American planta|tions, who can forbear admiring their fidelity, though it expre&s;&s;es it&s;elf in &s;o dreadful a manner? What might not that &s;avage greatne&s;s of &s;oul, which appears in the&s;e poor wretches on many occa&s;ions, be rai&s;ed to, were it rightly cultivated? And what colour of excu&s;e can there be, for the contempt with which we treat this part of our &s;pecies; that we &s;hould not put them upon the common foot of humanity; that we &s;hould only &s;et an in&s;ignificant fine upon the man who murders them; nay, that we &s;hould, as much as in us lies, cut them off from the pro&s;pects of happine&s;s in another world, as well as in this; and deny them that which we look upon as the pro|per means for attaining it?</P>
<P>It is therefore an un&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ing, to be born in tho&s;e parts of the world where wi&s;dom and knowledge flouri&s;h; though, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, there are, even in the&s;e parts, &s;everal poor unin&s;tructed per&s;ons, who are but little above the inhabitants of tho&s;e nations of which I have been here &s;peaking; as tho&s;e who have had the advantages of a more liberal education, ri&s;e

<HEAD>SECTION II. On Gratitude.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not a more plea&s;ing exerci&s;e of the mind, than gratitude. It is accompanied with &s;uch inward &s;a|tisfaction, that the duty is &s;ufficiently rewarded by the performance. It is not, like the practice of many other virtues, difficult and painful, but attended with &s;o much plea&s;ure, that were there no po&s;itive command which en|joined it, nor any recompen&s;e laid up for it hereafter, a generous mind would indulge in it, for the natural grati|fication which it affords.</P>
<P>If gratitude is due from man to man, how much more from man to his Maker?&mdash;The Supreme Being does not only confer upon us tho&s;e bounties which proceed more immediately from his hand, but even tho&s;e benefits which are conveyed to us by others. Every ble&s;&s;ing we enjoy, by what means &s;oever it may be derived upon us, is the gift of Him who is the great Author of good, and the Father of mercies.</P>
<P>If gratitude, when exerted towards one another, na|turally produces a very plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation in the mind

of a grateful man, it exalts the &s;oul into rapture, when it is employed on this great object of gratitude; on this beneficent Being, who has given us every thing we al|ready po&s;&s;e&s;s, and from whom we expect every thing we yet hope for.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. On Forgivene&s;s</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t plain and natural &s;entiments of equity con|cur with divine authority, to enforce the duty of forgive|ne&s;s. Let him who has never in his life done wrong, be allowed the privilege of remaining inexorable. But let &s;uch as are con&s;cious of frailties and crimes, con&s;ider for|givene&s;s as a debt which they owe to others. Common failings are the &s;tronge&s;t le&s;&s;on of mutual forbearance. Were this virtue unknown among men, order and com|fort, peace and repo&s;e, would be &s;trangers to human life. Injuries retaliated according to the exhorbitant mea&s;ure which pa&s;&s;ion pre&s;cribes, would excite re&s;entment in re|turn. The injured per&s;on would become the injurer; and thus wrongs, reta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iations, and fre&s;h injuries, would circulate in endle&s;s &s;ucc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ion, till the world was rendered a field of blood. Of all the pa&s;&s;ions which invade the human brea&s;t, revenge is the mo&s;t direful. When allow|ed to reign with full dominion, it is more than &s;ufficient to poi&s;on the few plea&s;ures which remain to man in his pre&s;ent &s;tate. How much &s;oever a per&s;on may &s;uffer from inju&s;tice, he is always in hazard of &s;uffering more from the pro&s;ecution of revenge. The violence of an enemy cannot inflict what is equal to the torment he cre|ates

to him&s;elf, by means of the fierce and de&s;perate pa&s;&s;ions which he allows to rage in his &s;oul.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e evil &s;pirits who inhabit the regions of mi&s;ery, are repre&s;ented as delighting in revenge and cruelty. But all that is great and good in the univer&s;e is on the &s;ide of clemency and mercy. The almighty Ruler of the world, though for ages offended by the unrigheou&s;|ne&s;s, and in&s;ulted by the impiety of men, is "long-&s;uf|fering and &s;low to anger." His Son, when he appeared in our nature, exhibited, both in his life, and his death, the mo&s;t illu&s;trious example of forgivene&s;s which the world ever beheld. If we look into the hi&s;tory of mankind, we &s;hall find that, in every age, they who have been re|&s;pected as worthy, or admired as great, have been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for this virtue. Revenge dwells in little minds. A noble and magnanimous &s;pirit is always &s;uperior to it. It &s;uffers not from the injuries of men tho&s;e &s;evere &s;hocks which others feel. Collected within it&s;elf, it &s;tands un|moved by their impotent a&s;&s;aults; and with generous pity, rather than with anger, looks down on their unwor|thy conduct.&mdash;It has been truly &s;aid, that the greate&s;t man on earth can no &s;ooner commit an injury, than a good man can make him&s;elf greater, by forgiving it.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. Motives to the practice of Gentlene&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>TO promote the virtue of gentlene&s;s, we ought to view our character with an impartial eye; and to learn, from our own failings, to give that indulgence which in
<PB N="88" REF="038017_0088_1010D3FA796E7420">
our turn we claim. It is pride which fills the world with &s;o much har&s;hne&s;s and &s;everity. In the fulne&s;s of &s;elf|e&s;timation, we forget what we are. We claim attentions to which we are not entitled. We are rigorous to offen|ces, as if we had never offended; unfeeling to di&s;tre&s;s, as if we knew not what it was to &s;uffer. From tho&s;e airy regions of pride and folly, let us de&s;cend to our pro|per level. Let us &s;urvey the natural equality on which Providence has placed man with man, and reflect on the infirmities common to all. If the reflection on natural equality and mutual offences, be in&s;ufficient to prompt humanity, let us at lea&s;t remember what we are in the &s;ight of our Creator. Have we none of that forbearance to give one another, which we all &s;o earne&s;tly intreat from hea|ven? Can we look for clemency or gentlene&s;s from our Judge, when we are &s;o backward to &s;how it to our own brethren?</P>
<P>Let us al&s;o accu&s;tom our&s;elves, to reflect on the &s;mall moment of tho&s;e things, which are the u&s;ual incentives to violence and contention. In the ruffled and angry hour, we view every appearance through a fal&s;e medium. The mo&s;t incon&s;iderable point of intere&s;t, or honour, &s;wells into a momentous object; and the &s;lighte&s;t attack &s;eems to threaten immediate ruin. But after pa&s;&s;ion or pride has &s;ub&s;ided, we look around in vain for the mighty mi&s;chiefs we dreaded. The fabric, which our di&s;turbed imagination had reared, totally di&s;appears. But though the cau&s;e of contention has dwindled away, its con&s;equen|ces remain. We have alienated a friend; we have em|bittered an enemy; we have &s;own the &s;eeds of future &s;u&s;picion, malevolence, or di&s;gu&s;t.&mdash;Let us &s;u&s;pend our

Let us reflect how little we have any pro&s;pect of gaining by fierce contention, but how much of the true happine&s;s of life we are certain of throwing away. Ea&s;ily, and from the &s;malle&s;t chink, the bitter waters of &s;trife are let forth; but their cour&s;e cannot be fore&s;een; and he &s;eldom fails of &s;uffering mo&s;t from their poi&s;onous effect, who fir&s;t allowed them to flow.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. A &s;u&s;picious Temper the Source of Mi&s;ery to its Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</HEAD>
<P>AS a &s;u&s;picious &s;pirit is the &s;ource of many crimes and calamities in the world, &s;o it is the &s;pring of certain mi&s;ery to the per&s;on who indulges it. His friends will be few; and &s;mall will be his comfort in tho&s;e whom he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. Believing others to be his enemies, he will of cour&s;e make them &s;uch. Let his caution be ever &s;o great, the a&s;perity of his thoughts will often break out in his behaviour; and in return for &s;u&s;pecting and hating, he will incur &s;u&s;picion and hatred. Be&s;ides the external evils which he draws upon him&s;elf, ari&s;ing from alienated friend&s;hip, broken confidence, and open enmity, the &s;u&s;|picious temper it&s;elf is one of the wor&s;t evils which any man can &s;uffer. If "in all fear there is torment," how mi&s;erable mu&s;t be his &s;tate who, by living in perpetual jealou&s;y, lives in perpetual dread? Looking upon him|&s;elf to be &s;urrounded with &s;pies, enemies, and de&s;igning men, he is a &s;tranger to reliance and tru&s;t. He knows

not to whom to open him&s;elf. He dre&s;&s;es his counte|nance in forced &s;miles, while his heart throbs within from apprehen&s;ions of &s;ecret treachery. Hence fret|fulne&s;s and ill-humour, di&s;gu&s;t at the world, and all the painful &s;en&s;ations of an irritated and embittered mind.</P>
<P>So numerous and great are the evils ari&s;ing from a &s;u&s;picious di&s;po&s;ition, that, of the two extremes, it is more eligible to expo&s;e our&s;elves to occa&s;ional di&s;advan|tage from thinking too well of others, than to &s;uffer con|tinual mi&s;ery by thinking always ill of them.

Eve|ry delu&s;ive pro&s;pect of ambition is now at an end; long experience of mankind, an experience very different from what the open and generous &s;oul of youth had fond|ly dreamt of has rendered the heart almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible to new friend&s;hips. The principal &s;ources of activity are taken away, when tho&s;e for whom we labour are cut off from us; tho&s;e who animated, and tho&s;e who &s;weet|ened all the toils of life. Where then can the &s;oul find refuge, but in the bo&s;om of Religion? There &s;he is ad|mitted to tho&s;e pro&s;pects of Providence and futurity, which alone can warm and fill the heart. I &s;peak here of &s;uch as retain the feelings of humanity; whom mi&s;|fortunes have &s;oftened, and perhaps rendered more deli|cately &s;en&s;ible: not of &s;uch as po&s;&s;e&s;s that &s;tupid in&s;en|&s;ibility, which &s;ome are plea&s;ed to dignify with the name of Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>It might therefore be expected, that tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who think they &s;tand in no need them&s;elves of the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of religion to &s;upport their virtue, and who never feel the want of its con&s;olations, would yet have the hu|manity

to con&s;ider the very different &s;ituation of the re&s;t of mankind; and not endeavour to deprive them of what habit, at lea&s;t, if they will not allow it to be nature, has made nece&s;&s;ary to their morals, and to their happine&s;s. It might be expected, that humanity would prevent them from breaking into the la&s;t retreat of the unfortunate, who can no longer be objects of their envy or re&s;ent|ment; and tearing from them their only remaining com|fort. The attempt to ridicule religion may be agreeable to &s;ome, by relieving them from re&s;traint upon their plea&s;ures; and may render others very mi&s;erable, by making them doubt tho&s;e truths, in which they were mo&s;t deeply intere&s;ted; but it can convey real good and hap|pine&s;s to no one individual.</P>

<P>IT is a &s;ure indication of good &s;en&s;e, to be diffident of it. We then, and not till then, are growing wi&s;e, when we begin to di&s;cern how weak and unwi&s;e we are. An ab&s;olute perfection of under&s;tanding, is impo&s;&s;ible: he makes the neare&s;t approaches to it, who has the &s;en&s;e to di&s;cern, and the humility to acknowledge, its imperfec|tions. Mode&s;ty always &s;its gracefully upon youth; it covers a multitude of faults, and doubles the lu&s;tre of every virtue which it &s;eems to hide: the perfections of men being like tho&s;e flowers which appear more beauti|ful, when their leaves are a little contracted and folded up, than when they are full blown, and di&s;play them&s;elves, without any re&s;erve, to the view.</P>

and are to render account at the la&s;t. That portion of it which he has allotted us, is intended partly for the concerns of this world, partly for tho&s;e of the next. Let each of the&s;e occupy, in the di&s;tribution of our time, that &s;pace which properly belongs to it. Let not the hours of ho&s;pitality and plea&s;ure interfere with the di&s;charge of our nece&s;&s;ary affairs; and let not what we call nece&s;&s;ary affairs, encroach upon the time which is due to devotion. To every thing there is a &s;ea&s;on, and a time for every purpo&s;e under the heaven. If we delay till to-morrow what ought to be done to-day, we overcharge the morrow with a burden which belongs not to it. We load the wheels of time, and prevent them from carrying us along &s;moothly. He who every morning plans the tran&s;actions of the day, and follows out that plan, carries on a thread which will guide him through the labyrinth of the mo&s;t bu&s;y life. The order|ly arrangement of his time is like a ray of light, which darts it&s;elf through all his affairs. But, where no plan is laid, where the di&s;po&s;al of time is &s;urrendered merely to the chance of incidents, all things lie huddled together in one chaos, which admits neither of di&s;tribution nor review.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t requi&s;ite for introducing order into the man|agement of time, is to be impre&s;&s;ed with a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of its value. Let us con&s;ider well how much depends upon it, and how fa&s;t it flies away. The bulk of men are in nothing more capricious and incon&s;i&s;tent, than in their appreciation of time. When they think of it, as the mea&s;ure of their continuance on earth, they highly prize it, and with the greate&s;t anxiety &s;eek to lengthen it out. But when they view it in &s;eparate parcels, they appear to hold it in contempt, and &s;quander it with incon&s;iderate

profu&s;ion. While they complain that life is &s;hort, they are often wi&s;hing its different periods at an end. Covet|ous of every other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, of time only they are pro|digal. They allow every idle man to be ma&s;ter of this property, and make every frivolous occupation welcome that can help them to con&s;ume it. Among tho&s;e who are &s;o carele&s;s of time, it is not to be expected that order &s;hould be ob&s;erved in its di&s;tribution. But, by this fatal neglect, how many materials of &s;evere and la&s;ting regret are they laying up in &s;tore for them&s;elves! The time which they &s;uffer to pa&s;s away in the mid&s;t of confu&s;ion, bitter repentance &s;eeks afterwards to recal. What was omitted to be done at its proper moment, ari&s;es to be the torment of &s;ome future &s;ea&s;on. Manhood is di&s;graced by the con&s;equences of neglected youth. Old age, op|pre&s;&s;ed by cares that belonged to a former period, labours under a burden not its own. At the clo&s;e of life, the dying man beholds with angui&s;h that his days are fini&s;h|ing, when his preparation for eternity is hardly com|menced. Such are the effects of a di&s;orderly wa&s;te of time, through not attending to its value. Every thing in the life of &s;uch per&s;ons is mi&s;placed. Nothing is performed aright, from not being performed in due &s;ea|&s;on.</P>
<P>But he who is orderly in the di&s;tribution of his time, takes the proper method of e&s;caping tho&s;e manifold evils. He is ju&s;tly &s;aid to redeem the time. By proper manage|ment, he prolongs it. He lives much in little &s;pace; more in a few years than others do in many. He can live to God and his own &s;oul, and at the &s;ame time attend to all the lawful intere&s;ts of the pre&s;ent world. He looks back on the pa&s;t, and provides for the future. He

catches and arre&s;ts the hours as they fly. They are marked down for u&s;eful purpo&s;es, and their memory re|mains. Whereas tho&s;e hours fleet by the man of con|fu&s;ion like a &s;hadow. His days and years are either blanks of which he has no remembrance, or they are filled up with &s;uch a confu&s;ed and irregular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of unfini&s;hed tran&s;actions, that though he remembers he has been bu&s;y, yet he can give no account of the bu&s;ine&s;s which has employed him.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IX. The Dignity of Virtue amid&s;t corrupt Examples.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t excellent and honourable character which can adorn a man and a Chri&s;tian, is acquired by re&s;i&s;ting the torrent of vice, and adhering to the cau&s;e of God and virtue again&s;t a corrupted multitude. It will be found to hold in general, that all tho&s;e, who, in any of the great lines of life, have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for thinking profoundly, and acting nobly, have de&s;pi&s;ed popular pre|judices; and departed, in &s;everal things, from the com|mon ways of the world. On no occa&s;ion is this more requi&s;ite for true honour, than where religion and morality are concerned. In times of prevailing licentiou&s;ne&s;s, to maintain unblemi&s;hed virtue, and uncorrupted integrity; in a public or a private cau&s;e, to &s;tand firm by what is fair and ju&s;t, amid&s;t di&s;couragements and oppo&s;ition; de&s;pi&s;ing groundle&s;s cen&s;ure and reproach; di&s;daining all compliance with public manners, when they are vicious and unlawful; and never a&s;hamed of the punctual

di&s;charge of every duty towards God and man;&mdash;this is what &s;hows true greatne&s;s of &s;pirit, and will force ap|probation even from the degenerate multitude them&s;elves. "This is the man," (their con&s;cience will oblige them to acknowledge,) "whom we are unable to bend to mean conde&s;cen&s;ions. We &s;ee it in vain either to flatter or to threaten him; he re&s;ts on a principle within, which we cannot &s;hake. To this man we may, on any occa&s;ion, &s;afely commit our cau&s;e. He is incapable of betraying his tru&s;t, or de&s;erting his friend, or denying his faith."</P>
<P>It is, accordingly, this &s;teady inflexible virtue, this re|gard to principle, &s;uperior to all cu&s;tom and opinion, which peculiarly marked the characters of tho&s;e in any age, who have &s;hone with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre; and has con&s;ecrated their memory to all po&s;terity. It was this that obtained to ancient Enoch the the mo&s;t &s;ingular te&s;|timony of honour from heaven. He continued to "walk with God," when the world apo&s;ti&s;ed from him. He plea&s;ed God, and was beloved of him; &s;o that living among &s;inners, he was tran&s;lated to heaven without &s;eeing death; "Yea, &s;peedily was he taken away, le&s;t wicked|ne&s;s &s;hould have altered his under&s;tanding, or deceit be|guiled his &s;oul." When Sodom could not furni&s;h ten righteous men to &s;ave it, Lot remained un&s;potted amid&s;t the contagion. He lived like an angel among &s;pirits of darkne&s;s; and the de&s;troying flame was not permitted to go forth, till the good man was called away by a heaven|ly me&s;&s;enger from his devoted city. When "all fle&s;h had corrupted their way upon the earth," then lived No|ah, a righteous man, and a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s. He &s;tood alone, and was &s;coffed by the profane crew

<HEAD>SECTION X. The Mortifications of Vice greater than tho&s;e of Virtue.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH no condition of human life is free from un|ea&s;ine&s;s, yet it mu&s;t be allowed, that the unea&s;ine&s;s belong|ing to a &s;inful cour&s;e, is far greater, than what attends a cour&s;e of well-doing. If we are weary of the labours of virtue, we may be a&s;&s;ured, that the world, whenever we try the exchange, will lay upon us a much heavier load. It is the out&s;ide, only, of a licentious life, which is gay and &s;miling. Within, it conceals toil, and trouble, and deadly &s;orrow. For vice poi&s;ons human happine&s;s in the &s;pring, by introducing di&s;order into the heart. Tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which it &s;eems to indulge, it only feeds with im|perfect gratifications; and thereby &s;trengthens them for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, in the end, on their unhappy victims.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="038017_0099_1010D41C64FD6FC8">It is a great mi&s;take to imagine, that the pain of &s;elf-denial is confined to virtue. He who follows the world, as much as he who follows Chri&s;t, mu&s;t "take up his cro&s;s;" and to him a&s;&s;uredly, it will prove a more op|pre&s;&s;ive burden. Vice allows all our pa&s;&s;ions to range uncontrouled: and where each claims to be &s;uperior, it is impo&s;&s;ible to gratify all. The predominant de&s;ire can only be indulged at the expen&s;e of its rival. No mortifi|cations which virtue exacts, are more &s;evere than tho&s;e, which ambition impo&s;es upon the love of ea&s;e, pride up|on intere&s;t, and covetou&s;ne&s;s upon vanity. Self-denial, therefore, belongs, in common, to vice and virtue; but with this remarkable difference, that the pa&s;&s;ions which virtue requires us to mortify, it tends to weaken; whereas, tho&s;e which vice obliges us to deny, it, at the &s;ame time, &s;trengthens. The one dimini&s;hes the pain of &s;elf-deni|al, by moderating the demand of pa&s;&s;ion; the other in|crea&s;es it, by rendering tho&s;e demands imperious and vi|olent. What di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that occur in the calm life of vir|tue, can be compared to tho&s;e tortures, which remor&s;e of con&s;cience inflicts on the wicked; to tho&s;e &s;evere humili|ations, ari&s;ing from guilt combined with misfortunes, which &s;ink them to the du&s;t; to tho&s;e violent agitations of &s;hame and di&s;appointment, which &s;ometimes drive them to the mo&s;t fatal extremities, and make them abhor their exi&s;tence? How often, in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rous &s;ituations, into which their crimes have brought them, have they execrated the &s;eductions of vice; and, with bitter regret, looked back to the day on wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch they fir&s;t for&s;ook the path of innocence!</P>

It extingui&s;hes all murmur, repining, and ingratitude, towards that Being who has allotted him his part to act in this world.

It gives &s;weetne&s;s to his conver&s;ation, and a perpetual &s;erenity to all his thoughts.</P>
<P>Among the many methods which might be made u&s;e of for acquiring this virtue, I &s;hall mention only the two following. Fir&s;t of all, a man &s;hould always con|&s;ider how much he has more than he wants; and &s;e|condly, how much more unhappy he might be than he really is.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, a man &s;hould always con&s;ider how much he has more than he wants, I am wonderfully plea&s;ed with the reply which Ari&s;tippus made to one, who con|doled him upon the lo&s;s of a farm: "Why," &s;aid he, "I have three farms &s;till, and you have but one; &s;o that I ought rather to be afflicted for you than you for me." On the contrary, fooli&s;h men are more apt to con&s;ider what they have lo&s;t, than what they po&s;&s;e&s;s;
<PB N="101" REF="038017_0101_1010C7201C468A68">
and to fix their eyes upon tho&s;e who are richer than them&s;elves, rather than on tho&s;e who are under greater difficulties. All the real plea&s;ures and conveniencies of life lie in a narrow compa&s;s; but it is the humour of mankind to be always looking forward; and &s;training after one who has got the &s;tart of them in wealth and honour. For this rea&s;on, as none can be properly called rich, who have not more than they want, there are few rich men in any of the politer nations, but among the middle &s;ort of people, who keep their wi&s;hes within their fortunes, and have more wealth than they know how to enjoy. Per&s;ons of a higher rank live in a kind of &s;plendid poverty; and are per|petually wanting, becau&s;e, in&s;tead of acquie&s;cing in the &s;olid plea&s;ures of life, they endeavour to outvie one another in &s;hadows and appearances. Men of &s;en&s;e have at all times beheld, with a great deal of mirth, this &s;ily game that is playing over their heads; and, by contracting their de&s;ires, enjoy all that &s;ecret &s;atisfaction which others are always in que&s;t of. The truth is, this ridiculous cha&s;e after imaginary plea&s;ures, cannot be &s;ufficienly expo&s;ed, as it is the great &s;ource of tho&s;e evils which generally undo a nation. Let a man's e&s;tate be what it may, he is a poor man, if he does not live within it; and naturally &s;ets him&s;elf to &s;ale to any one that can give him his price. When Pittacus, after the death of his brother, who had left him a good e&s;tate, was offered a great &s;um of money by the king of Lydia, he thanked him for his kindne&s;s; but told him, he had already more by half than he knew what to do with. In &s;hort, content is equivalent to

wealth, and luxury to poverty; or, to give the thought a more agreeable turn, "Content is natural wealth," &s;ays Socrates; to which I &s;hall add, Luxury is artificial poverty. I &s;hall therefore recommend to the con|&s;ideration of tho&s;e, who are always aiming at &s;uper|fluous and imaginary enjoyments, and who will not be at the trouble of contracting their de&s;ires, an excellent &s;aying of Bion the philo&s;opher, namely, "That no man has &s;o much care, as he who endeavours after the mo&s;t happine&s;s."</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, every one ought to reflect how much mure unhappy he might be, than he really is.&mdash; The former con&s;ideration took in all tho&s;e, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ufficiently provided with the means to make them|&s;elves ea&s;y; this regards &s;uch as actually lie under &s;ome pre&s;&s;ure or misfortune.

<P>I like the &s;tory of the hone&s;t Dutchman, who, upon breaking his leg by a fall from the main-ma&s;t, told the &s;tanders by, it was a great mercy that it was not his neck. To which, &s;ince I am got into quotations, give me leave to add the &s;aying of an old philo&s;opher, who, after having invited &s;ome of his friends to dine with him, was rufled by a per&s;on that came into the room in a pa&s;&s;ion, and threw down the table that &s;tood be|fore them: "Every one," &s;ays he, "has his calamity; and he is a happy man that has no greater than this." We find an in&s;tance to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, in the life of Doctor Hammond, written by Bi&s;hop Fell. As this

By the &s;implicity and uniformity of his life, he is delivered from that variety of cares, which perplex tho&s;e who have great affairs to manage, intricate plans to pur&s;ue, many enemies, perhaps, to encounter in the pur&s;uit. In the tranpuility of his &s;mall habitation, and private family, he enjoys a peace which is often un|known at courts.

<HEAD>SECTION XIII. Patience under Provocations our Intere&s;t as well as Duty.</HEAD>
<P>THE wide circle of human &s;ociety is diver&s;ified by an endle&s;s variety of characters, di&s;po&s;itions, and pa&s;&s;ions. Uniformity is, in no re&s;pect, the genius of the world. Every man is marked by &s;ome peculiarity which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes him from another: and no where can two indi|viduals be found, who are exactly, and in all re&s;pects alike. Where &s;o much diver&s;ity obtains, it cannot but happen, that, in the intercour&s;e which men are obliged to maintain, their tempers &s;hall often be ill adju&s;ted to that intercour&s;e: &s;hall jar, and interfere with each other. Hence, in every &s;tation, the highe&s;t as well as the lowe&s;t, and in every condition of life, public, pri|vate, and dome&s;tic, occa&s;ions of irritation frequently ari&s;e. We are provoked, &s;ometimes, by the folly and le|vity of tho&s;e with whom we are connected; &s;ometimes, by their indifference or neglect; by the incivility of a friend, the haughtine&s;s of a &s;uperior, or the in&s;olent be|haviour of one in lower &s;tation. Hardly a day pa&s;&s;es, without &s;omewhat or other occurring, which &s;erves to ruffle the man of impatient &s;pirit. Of cour&s;e, &s;uch a man lives in a continual &s;torm. He knows not what it is to enjoy a train of good humour. Servants, neigh|bours, friends, &s;pou&s;e, and children, all, through the un|re&s;trained violence of his temper, become &s;ources of di&s;|turbance and vexation to him. In vain is affluence; in vain are health and pro&s;perity. The lea&s;t trifle is &s;uf|ficient to di&s;compo&s;e his mind, and poi&s;on his plea&s;ures.

<P>THE active mind of man &s;eldom or never re&s;ts &s;atis|fied with is pre&s;ent condition, how pro&s;perous &s;oever. Originally formed for a wider range of objects, for a higher &s;phere of enjoyments, it finds it&s;elf, in every &s;ituation of fortune, &s;traitened and confined. Sen&s;ible of deficiency in its &s;tate, it is ever &s;ending forth the fond de&s;ire, the a&s;piring wi&s;h, after &s;omething beyond what is enjoyed at pre&s;ent. Hence, that re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s which prevails &s;o generally among mankind. Hence, that di&s;gu&s;t of plea&s;ures which they have tried; that pa&s;&s;ion for novelty; that ambition of ri&s;ing to &s;ome degree of eminence or felicity, of which they have formed to them&s;elves an indi&s;tinct idea. All which
<PB N="109" REF="038017_0109_1010D4338499B818">
may be con&s;idered as indications of a certain native, original greatne&s;s in the human &s;oul, &s;welling beyond the limits of its pre&s;ent condition; and pointing at the higher objects for which it was made. Happy, if the&s;e latent remains of our primitive &s;tate, &s;erved to di|rect our wi&s;hes towards their proper de&s;tination, and to lead us into the path of true bli&s;s!</P>
<P>But in this dark and bewildered &s;tate, the a&s;piring ten|dency of our nature unfortunately takes an oppo&s;ite di|rection, and feeds a very mi&s;placed ambition. The flat|tering appearances which here pre&s;ent them&s;elves to &s;en&s;e; the di&s;tinctions which fortune confers; the advantages and plea&s;ures which we imagine the world to be capable of be&s;towing, fill up the ultimate wi&s;h of mo&s;t men. The&s;e are the objects which engro&s;s their &s;olitary mu&s;|ings, and &s;timulate their active labours; which warm the brea&s;ts of the young, animate the indu&s;try of the mid|dle aged, and often keep alive the pa&s;&s;ions of the old, un|til the very clo&s;e of life.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;uredly, there is nothing unlawful in our wi&s;hing to be freed from whatever is di&s;agreeable, and to ob|tain a fuller enjoyment of the comforts of life. But when the&s;e wi&s;hes are not tempered by rea&s;on, they are in dan|ger of precipitating us into much extravagance and folly. De&s;ires and wi&s;hes are the fir&s;t &s;prings of action. When they become exorbitant, the whole character is likely to be tainted. If we &s;uffer our fancy to create to it&s;elf worlds of ideal happine&s;s, we &s;hall di&s;compo&s;e the peace and order of our minds, and foment many hurtful pa&s;|&s;ions. Here, then, let moderation begin its reign: by bringing within rea&s;onable bounds the wi&s;hes that we

form. As &s;oon as they become extravagant, let us check them, by proper reflections on the fallacious nature of tho&s;e objects, which the world hangs out to allure de&s;ire.</P>
<P>You have &s;trayed, my friends, from the road which conducts to felicity, you have di&s;honoured the native dignity of your &s;ouls, in allowing your wi&s;hes to termi|nate on nothing higher than worldly ideas of greatne&s;s or happine&s;s. Your imagination roves in a land of &s;ha|dows. Unreal forms deceive you. It is no more than a phantom, an illu&s;ion of happine&s;s, which attracts your fond admiration; nay, an illu&s;ion of happine&s;s, which often conceals much real mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Do you imagine, that all are happy, who have attained to tho&s;e &s;ummits of di&s;tinction, towards which your wi&s;h|es a&s;pire? Alas! how frequently has experience &s;hown, that where ro&s;es were &s;uppo&s;ed to bloom, nothing but briers and thorns grew?

With all that is &s;plendid and &s;hining in the world, it is decreed that there &s;hould mix many deep &s;hades of woe.

There, the &s;torm &s;pends its violence, and there, the thunder breaks; while, &s;afe and unhurt, the inhabitant of the vale remains be|low.&mdash;Retreat, then, from tho&s;e vain and pernicious ex|cur&s;ions of extravagant de&s;ire. Satisfy your&s;elves with what is rational and attainable. Train your minds to moderate views of human life, and human happine&s;s.

<HEAD>SECTION XV. Omni&s;cience and Omnipre&s;ence of the <HI>DEITY,</HI> the Source of Con&s;olation to good Men.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS ye&s;terday, about &s;un-&s;et, walking in the open fields, till the night in&s;en&s;ibly fell upon me. I at fir&s;t amu&s;ed my&s;elf with all the richne&s;s and variety of colours, which appeared in the we&s;tern parts of heaven. In pro|portion as they faded away and went out, &s;everal &s;tars and planets appeared one after another, till the whole fir|mament was in a glow. The bluene&s;s of the ether was ex|ceedingly heightened and enlivened, by the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and the rays of all tho&s;e luminaries that pa&s;&s;ed through it. The galaxy appeared in its mo&s;t beautiful white. To complete the &s;cene, the full-moon ro&s;e, at length, in that clouded maje&s;ty, which Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ton takes no|tice of; and opened to the eye a new picture of nature, which was more finely &s;haded, and di&s;po&s;ed among &s;ofter lights, than that which the &s;un had before di&s;covered to us.</P>
<P>As I was &s;urveying the moon walking in her bright|ne&s;s, and taking her progre&s;s among the con&s;tellations, a thought aro&s;e in me, which I b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eve very often perplexes and di&s;turbs men of &s;erious and contemplative natures. David him&s;elf fell into it in that reflection: "When I con&s;ider the heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon
<PB N="112" REF="038017_0112_1010D43B661F9520">
and the &s;tars which thou ha&s;t ordained; what is man that thou art mindful of him, and the &s;on of man that thou regarde&s;t him!" In the &s;ame manner, when I con&s;ider|ed that infinite ho&s;t of &s;tars, or, to &s;peak more philo&s;ophi|cally, of &s;ins, which were then &s;hining upon me; with tho&s;e innumerable &s;ets of planets or worlds, which were moving round their re&s;pective &s;uns; when I &s;till enlarg|ed the idea, and &s;uppo&s;ed another heaven of &s;uns and worlds, ri&s;ing &s;till above this which we di&s;covered; and the&s;e &s;till enlightened by a &s;uperior firmament of lumina|ries, which are planted at &s;o great a di&s;tance, that they may appear to the inhabitants of the former, as the &s;tars do to us; in &s;hort, while I pur&s;ued this thought, I could not but reflect on that little in&s;ignificant figure, which I my&s;elf bore amid&s;t the immen&s;ity of God's works.</P>
<P>Were the &s;un, which enlightens this part of the crea|tion, with all the ho&s;t of planetary worlds that move a|bout him, utterly extingui&s;hed and annihilated, they would not be mi&s;&s;ed, more than a grain of &s;and upon the &s;ea|&s;hore. The &s;pace they po&s;&s;e&s;s is &s;o exceedingly little in compari&s;on of the whole, it would &s;carcely make a blank in the creation. The cha&s;m would be imperceptible to an eye, that could take in the whole compa&s;s of nature, and pa&s;s from one end of the creation to the other; as it is po&s;&s;ible there may be &s;uch a &s;en&s;e in our&s;elves hereafter, or in creatures which are at pre&s;ent more exalted than our&s;elves. By the help of gla&s;&s;e&s;s, we &s;ee many &s;tars, which we do not di&s;cover with our naked eyes; and the finer our tele&s;copes are, the more &s;till are our di&s;coveries. Huygenius carries this thought &s;o far, that he does not think it impo&s;&s;ible there may be &s;tars, who&s;e light has not yet travelled down to us, &s;ince their fir&s;t creation.
<PB N="113" REF="038017_0113_1010D44072DC3F98">
There is no que&s;tion that the univer&s;e has certain bounds &s;et to it; but when we con&s;ider that it is the work of infinite Power, prompted by infinite Goodne&s;s, with an infinite &s;pace to exert it&s;elf in, how can our imagination &s;et any bounds to it?</P>
<P>To return, therefore, to my fir&s;t thought, I could not but look upon my&s;elf with &s;ecret horror, as a being that was not worth the &s;malle&s;t regard of one who had &s;o great a work under his care and &s;uperintendency. I was afraid of being overlooked amid&s;t the immen&s;ity of nature; and lo&s;t among that infinite variety of creatures, which, in all probability, &s;warm through all the&s;e immea&s;ureable regi|ons of matter.</P>
<P>In order to recover my&s;elf from this mortifying thought, I con&s;idered that it took its ri&s;e from tho&s;e narrow con|ceptions, which we are apt to entertain of the Divine nature. We our&s;elves cannot attend to many different objects at the &s;ame time. If we are careful to in&s;pect &s;ome things, we mu&s;t of cour&s;e neglect others. This imperfection which we ob&s;erve in our&s;elves is an imper|fection that cleaves, in &s;ome degree, to creatures of the highe&s;t capacities, as they are creatures, that is beings of finite and limited natures. The pre&s;ence of every cre|ated being is confined to a certain mea&s;ure of &s;pace; and con&s;equently his ob&s;ervation is &s;tinted to a certain number of objects. The &s;phere in which we move, and act, and under&s;tand; is of a wider circumference to one crea|ture, than another, according a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we ri&s;e one above another in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence. But the wide&s;t of the&s;e our &s;pheres has its circumference. When, therefore, we reflect on the Divine nature, we are &s;o u&s;ed and accu&s;|tomed
<PB N="114" REF="038017_0114_1010C71D79038520">
to this imperfection in our&s;elves, that we cannot forbear, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a&s;cribing it to HIM, in whom there is no &s;hadow of imperfection. Our rea&s;on indeed a&s;&s;ures us, that his attributes are infinite; but the poorne&s;s of our conceptions is &s;uch, that it cannot forbear &s;etting bounds to every thing it contemplates, till our rea&s;on comes again to our &s;uccour, and throws down all tho&s;e little pre|judices, which ri&s;e in us unawares, and are natural to the mind of man.</P>
<P>We &s;hall therefore utterly extingui&s;h this melan|choly thought, of our being overlooked by our Maker in the multiplicity of his works, and the infinity of tho&s;e ob|jects among which he &s;eems to be ince&s;&s;antly employed, if we con&s;ider, in the fir&s;t place, that he is omnipre&s;ent: and in the &s;econd, that he is omni&s;cient.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider him in his omnipre&s;ence, his being pa&s;&s;es through, actuates, and &s;upports, the whole frame of nature. His creation, and every part of it, is full of him. There is nothing he has made, that is either &s;o di&s;tant, &s;o little, or &s;o incon&s;iderable, which he does not e&s;&s;entially inhabit. His &s;ub&s;tance is within the &s;ub&s;tance of every being, whether material or immaterial, and as intimately pre&s;ent to it, as that being is to it&s;elf. It would be an imperfection in him, were he able to move out of one place into another; or to withdraw him&s;elf from any thing he has created, or from any part of that &s;pace which he diffu&s;ed and &s;pread abroad to infinity. In &s;hort, to &s;peak of him in the language of the old philo&s;ophers, he is a be|ing who&s;e centre is every where, and his circumference no where.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, he is omni&s;cient as well as omni|pre&s;ent. His omni&s;cience indeed nece&s;&s;arily and natural|ly
<PB N="115" REF="038017_0115_1010D448BB6BE618">
flows from his omnipre&s;ence. He cannot but be con|&s;cious of every motion that ari&s;es in the whole material world, which he thus e&s;&s;entially pervades; and of every thought that is &s;tirring in the intellectual world, to every part of which he is thus intimately united. Were the &s;oul &s;eparate from the body, and with one glance of thought &s;hould &s;tart beyond the bounds of the creation; &s;hould it, for millions of years, continue its progre&s;s through infinite &s;pace, with the &s;ame activity, it would &s;till find it&s;elf within the embrace of its Creator, and encom|pa&s;&s;ed by the immen&s;ity of the Godhead.</P>
<P>In this con&s;ideration of the Almighty's omnipre&s;ence and omni&s;cience, every uncomfortable thought vani&s;hes. He cannot but regard every thing that has being, e&s;pecially &s;uch of his creatures who fear they are not regarded by him. He is privy to all their thoughts, and to that anxiety of heart in particular, which is apt to trouble them on this occa&s;ion: for, as it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould overlook any of his creatures, &s;o we may be confident that he regards, with an eye of mercy, tho&s;e who endea|vour to recommend them&s;elves to his notice; and, in un|feigned humility of hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, think them&s;elves unworthy that he &s;hould be mindful of them.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. Happine&s;s is founded in Rectitude of Conduct.</HEAD>
<P>ALL men pur&s;ue good, and would be happy, if they knew how: not happy for minutes, and mi&s;erable for hours; but happy, if po&s;&s;ible, through every part of their exi&s;tence. Either, therefore, there is a good of this &s;teady, durable kind, or there is not. If not, then all good mu&s;t be tran&s;ient and uncertain; and if &s;o, an ob|ject of the lowe&s;t value, which can little de&s;erve our at|tention or inquiry. But if there be a better good, &s;uch a good as we are &s;eeking; like every other thing, it mu&s;t be derived from &s;ome cau&s;e; and that cau&s;e mu&s;t either be external, internal, or mixed; in as much as, except the&s;e three, there is no other po&s;&s;ible. Now a &s;teady, durable good, cannot be derived from an external cau&s;e; &s;ince all derived from externals mu&s;t fluctuate as they fluctuate. By the &s;ame rule, it cannot be derived from a mixture of the two; becau&s;e the part which is external will propor|tionably de&s;troy its e&s;&s;ence. What then remains but the cau&s;e internal? the very cau&s;e which we have &s;uppo&s;ed, when we place the &s;overeign good in mind &mdash;in rectitude of conduct.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. Virtue Man's highe&s;t Intere&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>I FIND my&s;elf exi&s;ting upon a little &s;pot, &s;urrounded every way by an immen&s;e unknown expan&s;ion.&mdash;Where am I? What &s;ort of place do I inhabit? Is it exactly ac|commodated in every in&s;tance to my convenience? Is there no exce&s;s of cold, none of heat, to offend me? Am I never annoyed by animals, either of my own, or a dif|ferent kind? Is every thing &s;ub&s;ervient to me, as though I had ordered all my&s;elf? No&mdash;nothing like it&mdash;the far|the&s;t from it po&s;&s;ible. The world appears not, then, ori|ginally made for the private convenience of me alone?&mdash; It does not. But is it not po&s;&s;ible &s;o to accommodate it, by my own particular indu&s;try? If to accommodate man and bea&s;t, heaven and earth, if this be beyond me, it is not po&s;&s;ible. What con&s;equence then follows; or can there be any other than this&mdash;If I &s;eek an intere&s;t of my own detached from that of others, I &s;eek an in|tere&s;t which is chimerical, and which can never have ex|i&s;tence.</P>
<P>How then mu&s;t I determine? Have I no intere&s;t at all? If I have not, I am &s;tationed here to no purpo&s;e. But why no intere&s;t? Can I be contented with none but one &s;eparate and detached! Is a &s;ocial intere&s;t, joined with others, &s;uch an ab&s;urdity as not to be admitted? The bee, the beaver, and the tribes of herding animals, are &s;ufficient to convince me, that the thing is &s;omewhere at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible. How, then, am I a&s;&s;ured that it is not equally true of man? Admit it; and what follows! If &s;o, then honour and ju&s;tice are my intere&s;t; then the
<PB N="118" REF="038017_0118_1010D44F0FF714F8">
whole train of moral virtues are my intere&s;t; without &s;ome portion of which, not even thieves can maintain &s;ociety.</P>
<P>But, farther &s;till&mdash;I &s;top not here&mdash;I pur&s;ue this &s;ocial intere&s;t as far as I can trace my &s;everal relations. I pa&s;s from my own &s;tock, my own neighbourhood, my own nation, to the whole race of mankind, as di&s;per&s;ed through|out the earth. Am I not related to them all, by the mu|tual aids of commerce, by the general intercour&s;e of arts and letters, by that common nature which we all partici|pate!</P>
<P>Again&mdash;I mu&s;t have food and cloathing. Without a proper genial warmth, I in&s;tantly peri&s;h. Am I not re|lated, in this view, to the very earth it&s;elf? to the di&s;|tant &s;un, from who&s;e beams I derive vigour? to that &s;tu|pendous cour&s;e and order of the infinite ho&s;t of heaven, by which the times and &s;ea&s;ons ever uniformly pa&s;s on? Were this order once confounded, I could not probably &s;urvive a moment; &s;o ab&s;olutely do I depend on this com|mon general welfare. What, then, have I to do, but to enlarge virtue into piety! Not only honour and ju&s;tice, and what I owe to man, is my intere&s;t; but gratitude al&s;o, acquie&s;cence, re&s;ignation, adoration, and all I owe to this great polity, and its great Governour our com|mon Parent.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. The Inju&s;tice of an uncharitable Spirit.</HEAD>
<P>A SUSPICIOUS, uncharitable &s;pirit is not only incon|&s;i&s;tent with all &s;ocial virtue and happine&s;s, but it is al&s;o,
<PB N="119" REF="038017_0119_1010D4538BFE9650">
unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t. In order to form &s;ound opini|ons concerning characters and actions, two things are e&s;pecially requi&s;ite, information and impartiality. But &s;uch as are mo&s;t forward to decide unfavourably, are com|monly de&s;titute of both. In&s;tead of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, or even requiring, full information, the grounds on which they proceed are frequently the mo&s;t &s;light and &s;tivolous. A tale, perhaps, which the idle have invented, the inqui&s;itive have li&s;tened to, and the credulous have propagated; or a real incident which rumour, in carrying it along, has exaggerated and di&s;gui&s;ed, &s;upplies them with materials of confident a&s;&s;ertion, and deci&s;ive judgment. From an action they pre&s;ently look into the heart, and infer the motive. This &s;uppo&s;ed motive they conclude to be the ruling principle; and pronounce at once concerning the whole character.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more contrary both to equity and to &s;ound rea&s;on, than &s;uch precipitate judgments. Any man who attends to what pa&s;&s;es within him&s;elf, may ea&s;i|ly di&s;cern what a complicated &s;y&s;tem the human character is; and what a variety of circum&s;tances mu&s;t be taken into the account, in order to e&s;timate it truly. No &s;in|gle in&s;tance of conduct whatever, is &s;ufficient to deter|mine it. As from one worthy action, it were credulity, not charity, to conclude a per&s;on to be free from all vice; &s;o from one which is cen&s;urable, it is perfectly unju&s;t to infer that the author of it is without con&s;cience, and with|out merit. If we knew all the attending circum&s;tances, it might appear in an excu&s;able light; nay, perhaps, un|der a commendable form. The motives of the actor may have been entirely different from tho&s;e which we a&s;cribe
<PB N="120" REF="038017_0120_1010D456DBA168F8">
to him; and where we &s;uppo&s;e him impelled by bad de|&s;ign, he may have been prompted by con&s;cience and mi&s;|taken principle. Admitting the action to have been in every view criminal, he may have been hurried into it through inadvertency and &s;urpri&s;e. He may have &s;in|cerely repented; and the virtuous principle may have now regained its full vigour. Perhaps this was the cor|ner of frailty; the quarter on which he lay open to the incur&s;ions of temptation; while the other avenues of his heart were firmly guarded by con&s;cience.</P>
<P>It is therefore evident, that no part of the government of temper de&s;erves attention more, than to keep our minds pure from uncharitable prejudices, and open to candour and humanity in judging of others.&mdash;The wor&s;t con&s;equences, both to our&s;elves and to &s;ociety, follow from the oppo&s;ite &s;pirit.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. The Misfortunes of Men mo&s;tly chargeable on them&s;elves.</HEAD>
<P>WE find man placed in a world, where he has by no means the di&s;po&s;al of the events that happen. Calami|ties &s;ometimes befall the worthie&s;t and the be&s;t, which it is not in their power to prevent, and where nothing is left them, but to acknowledge and to &s;ubmit to the high hand of Heaven. For &s;uch vi&s;itations of trial, many good and wi&s;e rea&s;ons can be a&s;&s;igned, which the pre&s;ent &s;ub|ject leads me not to di&s;cu&s;s. But though tho&s;e unavoid|able
<PB N="121" REF="038017_0121_1010D45B18956178">
calamities make a part, yet they make not the chief part, of the vexations and &s;orrows that di&s;tre&s;s human life. A multitude of evils be&s;et us, for the &s;ource of which we mu&s;t look to another quarter.&mdash;No &s;ooner has any thing in the health, or in the circum&s;tances of men, gone cro&s;s to their wi&s;h, than they begin to talk of the unequal di&s;tribution of the good things of this life; they envy the condition of others; they repine at their own lot, and fret again&s;t the Ruler of the world.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e &s;entiments, one man pines under a bro|ken con&s;titution. But let us a&s;k him, whether he can, fairly and hone&s;tly, a&s;&s;ign no cau&s;e for this but the un|known decree of Heaven? Has he duly valued the ble&s;|&s;ing of health, and always ob&s;erved the rules of virtue and &s;obriety? Has he been moderate in his life, and tem|perate in all his plea&s;ures? If now he is only paying the price of his former, perhaps his forgotten, indulgences, has he any title to complain, as if he were &s;uffering un|ju&s;tly? Were we to &s;urvey the chambers of &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, we &s;hould often find them peopled with the vic|tims of intemperance and &s;en&s;uality, and with the chil|dren of vitious indolence and &s;loth. Among the thou|&s;ands who langui&s;h there, we &s;hould find the proportion of innocent &s;ufferers to be &s;mall. We &s;hould &s;ee faded youth, premature old age, and the pro&s;pect of an untime|ly grave, to be the portion of multitudes who, in one way or other, have brought tho&s;e evils on them&s;elves; while yet the&s;e martyrs of vice and folly have the a&s;&s;u|rance to arraign the hard fate of man, and "to fret again&s;t the Lord."</P>
<P>But you, perhaps, complain of hard&s;hips of another kind, of the inju&s;tice of the world; of the poverty which
<PB N="122" REF="038017_0122_1010D45DC96ECF68">
you &s;uffer, and the di&s;couragements under which you labour; of the cro&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments of which your life has been doomed to be full.&mdash;Before you give too much &s;cope to your di&s;content, let me de&s;ire you to re|flect impartially upon your pa&s;t train of life. Have not &s;loth, or pride, or ill temper, or &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions, mi&s;led you often from the path of &s;ound and wi&s;e conduct? Have you not been wanting to your&s;elves in improving tho&s;e opportunities which Providence offered you, for better|ing and advancing your &s;tate? If you have cho&s;en to in|dulge your humour, or your ta&s;te, in the gratifications of indolence or plea&s;ure, can you complain becau&s;e others, in preference to you, have obtained tho&s;e advantages which naturally belong to u&s;eful labours, and honourable pur&s;uits? Have not the con&s;equences of &s;ome fal&s;e &s;teps, into which your pa&s;&s;ions, or your plea&s;ures, have betrayed you, pur&s;ued you through much of your life; tainted, perhaps, your characters, involved you in embarra&s;&s;ments, or &s;unk you into neglect?&mdash;It is an old &s;aying, that every man is the artificer of his own fortune in the world. It is certain, that the world &s;eldom turns wholly again&s;t a man, unle&s;s through his own fault. "Religion is," in general, "profitable unto all things." Virtue, diligence, and indu&s;try, joined with good temper and prudence, have ever been found the &s;ure&s;t road to pro&s;perity; and where men fail of attaining it, their want of &s;ucce&s;s is far of|tener owing to their having deviated from that road, than to their having encountered in&s;uperable bars in it. Some, by being too artful, forfeit the reputation of probity. Some, by being too open, are accounted to fail in pru|dence. Others, by being fickle and changeable, are di&s;|tru&s;ted by all.&mdash;The ca&s;e commonly is, that men &s;eek,
<PB N="123" REF="038017_0123_1010D45F9AB90C98">
to a&s;cribe their di&s;appointments to any cau&s;e, rather than to their own mi&s;conduct; and when they can devi&s;e no other cau&s;e, they lay them to the charge of Providence. Their folly leads them into vices: their vices into mis|fortunes; and in their misfortunes they "murmur again&s;t Providence." They are doubly unju&s;t towards their Creator. In their pro&s;perity, they are apt to a&s;cribe their &s;ucce&s;s to their own diligence, rather than to his ble&s;&s;ing; and in their adver&s;ity, they impute their di&s;tre&s;&s;es to his providence, not to their own mi&s;behaviour. Whereas, the truth is the very rever&s;e of this. "Every good and perfect gift cometh from above;" and of evil and mi&s;ery, man is the author to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When, from the condition of individuals, we look abroad to the public &s;tate of the world, we meet with more proofs of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. We &s;ee great &s;ocieties of men torn in pieces by inte&s;tine di&s;&s;en&s;ions, tumults, and civil commotions. We &s;ee mighty armies going forth, in formidable array, again&s;t each other, to cover the earth with blood, and to fill the air with the cries of widows and orphans. Sad evils the&s;e are, to which this mi&s;erable world is expo&s;ed.&mdash;But are the&s;e evils, I be&s;eech you, to be imputed to God? Was it he who &s;ent forth &s;laughtering armies into the field, or who filled the peaceful cities with ma&s;&s;acres and blood? Are the&s;e mi&s;eries any other, than the bitter fruit of men's violent and di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ions? Are they not clearly to be traced to the ambition and vices of princes, to the quarrels of the great, and the turbulence of the peo|ple?&mdash;Let us lay them entirely out of the account, in thinking of Providence; and let us think only of the "fooli&s;hne&s;s of man." Did man control his pa&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="124" REF="038017_0124_1010D4629A157D80">
and form his conduct according to the dictates of wi&s;|dom, humanity, and virtue, the earth would no longer be de&s;olated by cruelty; and human &s;ocieties would live in order, harmony, and peace. In tho&s;e &s;cenes of mi&s;chief and violence which fill the world, let man behold, with &s;hame, the picture of his vices, his ignorance, and folly. Let him be humbled by the mortifying view of his own perver&s;ene&s;s; but let not his "heart fret again&s;t the Lord."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. On Di&s;intere&s;ted Friend&s;hip.</HEAD>
<P>I AM informed that certain Greek writers (philo&s;o|phers, it &s;eems, in the opinion of their countrymen) have advanced &s;ome very extraordinary po&s;itions relating to friend&s;hip; as, indeed, what &s;ubject is there, which the&s;e &s;ubtle geniu&s;&s;es have not tortured with their &s;ophi&s;try?</P>
<P>The authors to whom I refer, di&s;&s;uade their di&s;ciples from entering into any &s;trong attachments, as unavoid|ably creating &s;upernumerary di&s;quietudes to tho&s;e who engage in them; and, as every man has more than &s;uffi|cient to call forth his &s;olicitude, in the cour&s;e of his own affairs, it is a weakne&s;s, they contend, anxiou&s;ly to in|volve him&s;elf in the concerns of others. They recom|mend it al&s;o, in all connexions of this kind, to hold the hands of union extremely loo&s;e; &s;o as always to have it in one's power to &s;traiten or relax them, as circum&s;tan|ces and &s;itu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ions &s;hall render mo&s;t expedient. They add, as a capital article of their doctrine, that, "to live exempt from cares, is an e&s;&s;ential ingredient to con|&s;titute
<PB N="125" REF="038017_0125_1010D465689000B0">
human happine&s;s: but an ingredient, however, which he, who voluntarily di&s;tre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with cares, in which he has no nece&s;&s;ary and per&s;onal intere&s;t, mu&s;t never hope to po&s;&s;e&s;s."</P>
<P>I have been told likewi&s;e, that there is another &s;et of pretended philo&s;ophers, of the &s;ame country, who&s;e tenets, concerning this &s;ubject, are of a &s;till more illiberal and ungenerous ca&s;t.</P>
<P>The propo&s;ition they attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h, is, that "friend&s;hip is an affair of &s;elf-intere&s;t entirely; and that the proper motive for engaging in it, is, not in order to gratify the kind and benevo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent affections, but for the benefit of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport which is to be de|rived from the connexion." Accordingly they a&s;&s;ert, that tho&s;e per&s;ons are mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to have recour&s;e to auxilia|ry alliances of this kind, who are lea&s;t qualified by na|ture, or fortune, to depend upon their own &s;trength and powers: the weaker &s;ex, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in&s;tance, being generally more inclined to engage in friend&s;hips, than the male part of our &s;pecies; and tho&s;e who are depre&s;&s;ed by indigence, or labouring under misfortunes, than the wealthy and the pro&s;perous.</P>
<P>Excellent and obliging &s;ages, the&s;e, undoubtedly! To &s;trike out the friendly affections from the moral world, would be like extingui&s;hing the &s;un in the natural: each of them being the &s;ource of the be&s;t and mo&s;t grateful &s;a|tisfactions, that Heaven has conferred on the &s;ons of men. But I &s;hould be glad to know, what the real value of this boa&s;ted exemption from care, which they promi&s;e their di&s;ciples, ju&s;tly amounts to? an exemption flattering to &s;elf-love, I confe&s;s; but which, upon many occurrences in human life, &s;hould be rejected with the utmo&s;t di&s;dain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="126" REF="038017_0126_1010D46A6DD70FC8" MS="y">
for nothing, &s;urely, can be more incon&s;i&s;tent with a well-poi&s;ed and manly &s;pirit, than to decline engaging in any laudable action, or to be di&s;couraged from per&s;evering in it, by an apprehen&s;ion of the trouble and &s;olicitude, with which it may probably be attended. Virtue her&s;elf, in|deed, ought to be totally renounced, if it be right to avoid every po&s;&s;ible means that may be productive of unea&s;ine&s;s: for who, that is actuated by her principles, can ob&s;erve the conduct of an oppo&s;ite character, without being af|fected with &s;ome degree of &s;ecret di&s;&s;atisfaction? Are not the ju&s;t, the brave, and the good, nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed to the di&s;agreeable emotions of di&s;like and aver&s;ion, when they re&s;pectively meet with in&s;tances of fraud, of cowar|dice, or of villainy? It is an e&s;&s;ential property of every well-con&s;tituted mind, to be affected with pain, or plea|&s;ure, according to the nature of tho&s;e moral appearances that pre&s;ent them&s;elves to ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>If &s;en&s;ibility, therefore, be not incompatible with true wi&s;dom, (and it &s;urely is not, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e that philo&s;ophy deadens every finer feeling of our nature,) what ju&s;t rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, why the &s;ympathetic &s;ufferings which may re&s;ult from friend&s;hip, &s;hould be a &s;ufficient inducement for bani&s;hing that generous affec|tion from the human brea&s;t? Extingui&s;h all emotions of the heart, and what difference will remain, I do not &s;ay between man and brute, but between man and a mere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nanimate clod? Away then with tho&s;e au&s;tere philo&s;o|phers, who repre&s;ent virtue as hardening the &s;oul again&s;t all the &s;ofter impre&s;&s;ions of humanity! The fact, cer|tainly, is much otherwi&s;e. A truly good man is, upon many occa&s;ions, extremely &s;u&s;ceptible of tender &s;enti|ments; and his heart expands with joy, or &s;hrinks with
<PB N="127" REF="038017_0127_1010D46C0D894560">
&s;orrow, as good or ill fortune accompanies his friend. Upon the whole, then, it may fairly be concluded, that, as in the ca&s;e of virtue, &s;o in that of friend&s;hip, tho&s;e pain|ful &s;en&s;ations, which may &s;ometimes be produced by the one, as well as by the other, are equally in&s;ufficient grounds for excluding either of them from taking po|&s;e&s;&s;ion of our bo&s;oms.</P>
<P>They who in&s;i&s;t that "utility is the fir&s;t and prevail|ing motive, which induces mankind to enter into parti|cular friend&s;hips," appear to me to dive&s;t the a&s;&s;ociation of its mo&s;t amiable and engaging principle. For, to a mind rightly di&s;po&s;ed, it is not &s;o much the benefits re|ceived, as the affectionate zeal from which they flow, that gives them their be&s;t and mo&s;t valuable recommendation. It is &s;o far indeed from being verified by fact, that a &s;en&s;e of our wants is the original cau&s;e of forming the&s;e ami|cable alliances; that, on the contrary, it is ob&s;ervable, that none have been more di&s;tingui&s;hed in their friend|&s;hips than tho&s;e, who&s;e power and opulence, but, above all, who&s;e &s;uperior virtue (a much firmer &s;upport) have rai&s;ed them above every nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others.</P>
<P>The true di&s;tinction, then, in this que&s;tion is, that "although friend&s;hip is certainly productive of utility, yet utility is not the primary motive of friend&s;hip."&mdash; Tho&s;e &s;elfi&s;h &s;en&s;uali&s;ts, therefore, who, lulled in the lap of luxury, pre&s;ume to maintain the rever&s;e, have &s;urely no claim to attention; as they are neither qualified by re|flection, nor experience, to be competent judges of the &s;ubject.</P>

<P><PB N="129" REF="038017_0129_1010D4731F8997D8">Thirdly, from the nature of the Supreme Being, who&s;e ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom, and veracity, are all concerned in this point.</P>
<P>But among the&s;e, and other excellent arguments for the immortality of the &s;oul, there is one drawn from the perpetual progre&s;s of the &s;oul to its perfection, without a po&s;&s;ibility of ever arriving at it; which is a hint that I do not remember to have &s;een opened and improved by others, who have written on this &s;ubject, though it &s;eems to me to carry a very great weight with it. How can it enter into the thoughts of man, that the &s;oul, which is capable of &s;uch immen&s;e perfections, and of receiving new improvements to all eternity, &s;hall fall away into nothing, almo&s;t as &s;oon as it is created? Are &s;uch abi|lities made for no purpo&s;e? A brute arrives at a point of perfection, that he can never pa&s;s: in a few years he has all the endowments he is capable of; and were he to live ten thou&s;and more, would be the &s;ame thing he is at pre&s;ent. Where a human &s;oul thus at a &s;tand in her ac|compli&s;hments; were her faculties to be full blown, and incapable of farther enlargements; I could imagine &s;he might fall away in&s;en&s;ibly, and drop at once into a &s;tate of annihilation. But can we believe a thinking being, that is in a perpetual progre&s;s of improvements, and travelling on from perfection, to perfection, after having ju&s;t looked abroad into the works of its Creator, and made a few di&s;coveries of his infinite goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom, and power, mu&s;t peri&s;h at her fir&s;t &s;etting out, and in the very beginning of her inquiries?</P>
<P>A man, con&s;idered only in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, &s;eems &s;ent into the world merely to propagate his kind. He pro|vides him&s;elf with a &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and immediately quits his
<PB N="130" REF="038017_0130_1010D47514679648">
po&s;t to make room for him. He does not &s;eem born to enjoy life, but to deliver it down to others. This is not &s;urpri&s;ing to con&s;ider in animals, which are formed for our u&s;e, and can fini&s;h their bu&s;ine&s;s in a &s;hort life. The &s;ilk-worm, after having &s;pun her ta&s;k, lays her eggs and dies. But a man cannot take in his full mea&s;ure of know|ledge, has not time to &s;ubdue his pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;tabli&s;h his &s;oul in virtue, and come up to the perfection of his nature, before he is hurried off the &s;tage. Would an infinitely wi&s;e Being make &s;uch glorious creatures for &s;o mean a purpo&s;e? Can he delight in the production of &s;uch abor|tive intelligences, &s;uch &s;hort-lived rea&s;onable beings? Would he give us talents that are not to be exerted? ca|pacities that are never to be gratified? How can we find that wi&s;dom which &s;hines through all his works, in the formation of man, without looking on this world as only a nur&s;ery for the next; and without believing that the &s;everal generations of rational creatures, which ri&s;e up and di&s;appear in &s;uch quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, are only to receive their fir&s;t rudiments of exi&s;tence here, and afterwards to be tran&s;planted into a more friendly climate, where they may &s;pread and flouri&s;h to all eternity?</P>
<P>There is not, in my opinion, a more plea&s;ing and trium|phant con&s;ideration in religion, than this of the perpetu|al progre&s;s, which the &s;oul makes towards the perfection of its nature, without ever arriving at a period in it. To look upon the &s;oul as going on from &s;trength to &s;trength; to con&s;ider that &s;he is to &s;hine for ever with new acce&s;&s;ions of glory, and brighten to all eternity; that &s;he will adding virtue to virtue and knowledge to knowledge; carries in it &s;omething wonderfully agreeable to that ambition, which is natural to the mind
<PB N="131" REF="038017_0131_1010D47854C50828">
of man. Nay, it mu&s;t be a pro&s;pect plea&s;ing to God him&s;elf, to &s;ee his creation for ever beautifying in his eyes; and drawing nearer to him, by greater degrees of re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>Methinks this &s;ingle con&s;ideration, of the progre&s;s of a finite &s;pirit to perfection, will be &s;ufficient to extingui&s;h all envy in inferior natures, and all contempt in &s;uperor. That cherub, which now appears as a god to a human &s;oul, knows very well, that the period will come about in eternity, when the human &s;oul &s;hall be as perfect as he him&s;elf now is: nay, when &s;he &s;hall look down upon that degree of perfection as much as &s;he now falls &s;hort of it. It is true, the higher nature &s;till advances, and by that means pre&s;erves his di&s;tance and &s;uperiority in the &s;cale of being; but he knows that, how high &s;oever the &s;ta|tion is of which he &s;tands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at pre&s;ent, the infe|rior nature will at length mount up to it; and &s;hine forth in the &s;ame degree of glory.</P>
<P>With what a&s;toni&s;hment and veneration, may we look into our own &s;ouls, where there are &s;uch hidden &s;tores of virtue and knowledge, &s;uch inexhau&s;ted &s;ources of per|fection! We know not yet what we &s;hall be; nor will it ever enter into the heart of man, to conceive the glo|ry that will be always in re&s;erve for him. The &s;oul, con&s;idered with its Creator, is like one of tho&s;e mathe|matical lines, that may draw nearer to another for all eternity, without a po&s;&s;ibility of touching it: and can there be a thought &s;o tran&s;porting, as to con&s;ider our|&s;elves in the&s;e perpetual approaches to HIM, who is the &s;tandard not only of perfection, but of happine&s;s!</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. The Sea&s;ons.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the great ble&s;&s;ings and wonders of the crea|tion, may be cla&s;&s;ed the regularities of times and &s;ea&s;ons. Immediately after the flood, the &s;acred promi&s;e was made to man, that &s;eed-time and harve&s;t, cold and heat, &s;ummer and winter, day and night, &s;hould continue to the very end of all things. Accordingly, in obedience to that promi&s;e, the rotation is con&s;tantly pre&s;enting us with &s;ome u&s;eful and agreeable alteration; and all the plea&s;ing novelty of life ari&s;es from the&s;e natural changes; nor are we le&s;s indebted to them for many of its &s;olid com|forts. It has been frequently the ta&s;k of the morali&s;t and poet, to mark, in poli&s;hed periods, the particular charms and conveniences of every change; and, indeed, &s;uch di&s;criminate ob&s;ervations upon natural variety, can|not be undelightful; &s;ince the ble&s;&s;ing, which every month brings along with it, is a fre&s;h in&s;tance of the wi&s;dom and bounty of that Providence, which regulates the glories of the year. We glow as we contemplate; we feel a propen&s;ity to adore, whil&s;t we enjoy. In the time of &s;eed-&s;owing, it is the &s;ea&s;on of <HI>confidence</HI>: the grain which the hu&s;bandman tru&s;ts to the bo&s;om of earth,

&s;hall, happly, yield its &s;even-fold rewards. Spring pre|&s;ents us with a &s;cene of lively <HI>expectation.</HI> That which was before &s;own begins now to di&s;cover &s;igns of &s;uc|ce&s;sful vegetation. The labourer ob&s;erves the change, and anticipates the harve&s;t: he watches the progre&s;s of nature, and &s;miles at her influence; while the man of contemplation walks forth with the evening, amid&s;t the fragrance of flowers, and promi&s;es of plenty; nor re|turns to his cottage till darkne&s;s clo&s;es the &s;cene upon his eye. Then cometh the harve&s;t, when the large wi&s;h is &s;atisfied, and the granaries of nature are loaded with the means of life, even to a luxury of abundance. The powers of language are unequal to the de&s;cription of this happy &s;ea&s;on. It is the carnival of nature: &s;un and &s;hade coolne&s;s and quietude, cheerfulne&s;s and melody, love and gratitude, unite to render every &s;cene of &s;ummer de|lightful.&mdash;The divi&s;ion of light and darkne&s;s is one of kinde&s;t efforts of Omnipotent Wi&s;dom. Day and night yield us contrary ble&s;&s;ings; and, at the &s;ame time, a&s;&s;i&s;t each other; by giving fre&s;h lu&s;tre to the delights of both. Amid&s;t the glare of day, and bu&s;tle of life, how could we &s;leep? Amid&s;t the gloom of darkne&s;s, how could we labour?</P>
<P>How wi&s;e, how benignant, then, is the proper divi|&s;ion! The hours of light are adapted to activity; and tho&s;e of darkne&s;s to re&s;t. Ere the day is pa&s;&s;ed, exer|ci&s;e and nature prepare us for the pillow; and by the time that the morning returns, we are again able to meet it with a &s;mile. Thus, every &s;ea&s;on has a charm pecu|liar to it&s;elf; and every moment affords &s;ome intere&s;ting innovation.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. The Cataract of Niagara, in Canada, North America.</HEAD>
<P>THIS amazing fall of water is made by the River St. Lawrence, in its pa&s;&s;age from lake Erie into the lake On|tario. The St. Lawrence is one of the large&s;t rivers in the world; and yet the whole of its waters is di&s;charged in this place, by a fall of a hundred and fifty feet perpen|dicular. It is not ea&s;y to bring the imagination to corre&s;pond to the greatne&s;s of the &s;cene. A river extremely deep and rapid, and that &s;erves to drain the waters of almo&s;t all North America into the Atlantic Ocean, is here pour|ed precipitately down a ledge of rocks, that ri&s;es, like a wall, acro&s;s the whole bed of its &s;tream. The river, a little above, is near three quarters of a mile broad; and the rocks, where it grows narrower, are four hundred yards over. Their direction is not &s;traight acro&s;s, but hollowing inwards like a hor&s;e-&s;hoe: &s;o that the cataract, which bends to the &s;hape of the ob&s;tacle, rounding in|wards, pre&s;ents a kind of theatre the mo&s;t tremendous in nature. Ju&s;t in the middle of this circular wall of waters, a little i&s;land, that has braved the fury of the current, pre&s;ents one of its points, and divides the &s;tream at top into two parts; but they unite again long before they reach the bottom. The noi&s;e of the fall is heard at the di&s;tance of &s;everal leagues; and the fury of the wa|ters, at the termination of their fall, is inconceivable. The da&s;hing produces a mi&s;t that ri&s;es to the very clouds; and which forms a mo&s;t beautiful rainbow, when the &s;un &s;hines. It will readily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;uch a cata|ract entirely de&s;troys the navigation of the &s;tream; and

<HEAD>SECTION III. The Grotto of Antiparos.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the &s;ubterraneous caverns now known, the grotto of Antiparos is the mo&s;t remarkable, as well for its extent, as for the beauty of its &s;parry incru&s;tations. This celebrated cavern was fir&s;t explored by one Magni, an Italian traveller, about a hundred years ago, at Anti|paros, an incon&s;iderable i&s;land of the Archipelago. "Hav|ing been informed," &s;ays he, "by the natives of Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ros, that, in the little i&s;land of Antiparos, which lies about two miles from the former, a gigantic &s;tatue was to be &s;een at the mouth of a cavern in that place, it was re|&s;olved that we (the French Con&s;ul and him&s;elf) &s;hould pay it a vi&s;it. In pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution, after we had landed on the i&s;land, and walked about four miles through the mid&s;t of beautiful plains, and &s;loping wood|lands, we at length came to a little hill, on the &s;ide of which yawned a mo&s;t horrid cavern, that by its gloom at fir&s;t &s;truck us with terror, and almo&s;t repre&s;&s;ed cu|rio&s;ity. Recovering the fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, however, we en|tered boldly; and had not proceeded above twenty paces, when the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tatue of the giant pre&s;ented it&s;elf to our view. We quickly perceived, that what the igno|rant natives had been terrified at as a giant, was nothing more than a &s;parry concretion, formed by the water drop|ping from the roof of the cave, and by degrees harden|ing into a figure, which their fears had formed into a

mon&s;ter. Incited by this extraordinary appearance, we were induced to proceed &s;till further, in que&s;t of new ad|ventures in this &s;ubterranean abode. As we proceeded, new wonders offered them&s;elves; the &s;pars, formed into trees and &s;hrubs, pre&s;ented a kind of petrified grove; &s;ome white, &s;ome green; and all receding in due per|&s;pective. They &s;truck us with the more amazement, as we knew them to be mere productions of Nature, who, hitherto in &s;olitude, had, in her playful moments, dre&s;&s;ed the &s;cene, as if for her own amu&s;ement."</P>
<P>"We had as yet &s;een but a few of the wonders of the place; and we were introduced only into the portico of this amazing temple. In one corner of this half illu|minated rece&s;s, there appeared an opening of about three feet wide, which &s;eemed to lead to a place totally dark, and which one of the natives a&s;&s;ured us contained nothing more than a re&s;ervoir of water. Upon this information, we made an experiment, by throwing down &s;ome &s;tones, which rumbling along the &s;ides of the de&s;cent for &s;ome time, the &s;ound &s;eemed at la&s;t qua&s;hed in a bed of water. In order, however, to be more certain, we &s;ent in a Le|vantine mariner, who, by the promi&s;e of a good reward, with a flambeau in his hand, ventured into this narrow aperture. After continuing within it for about a quar|ter of an hour, he returned, bearing in his hand, &s;ome beautiful pieces of white &s;par, which art could neither equal nor imitate. Upon being informed by him that the place was full of the&s;e beautiful incru&s;tations, I ven|tured in once more with him, about fifty paces, anxiou&s;ly and cautiou&s;ly de&s;cending, by a &s;teep and dangerous way. Finding, however, that we came to a precipice which led

into a &s;pacious amphitheatre, (if I may &s;o call it) &s;till deeper than any other part, we returned, and being pro|vided with a ladder, flambeau, and other things to expe|dite our de&s;cent, our whole company, man by man, ven|tured into the &s;ame opening; and de&s;cending one after another, we at la&s;t &s;aw our&s;elves all together in the mo&s;t magnificent part of the cavern."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. The Grotto of Artiparos continued.</HEAD>
<P>"OUR candles being now all lighted up, and the whole place completely illuminated, never could the eye be pre|&s;ented with a more glittering, or a more magnificent &s;cene. The whole roof hung with &s;olid i&s;icles, tran&s;parent as gla&s;s, yet &s;olid as marble. The eye could &s;carcely reach the lofty and noble ceiling; the &s;ides were regularly formed with &s;pars; and the whole pre&s;ented the idea of a magnificient theatre, illuminated with an immen&s;e pro|fu&s;ion of lights. The floor con&s;i&s;ted of &s;olid marble: and, in &s;everal places, magnificent columns, thrones, al|tars, and other objects, appeared, as if nature had de&s;ign|ed to mock the curio&s;ities of art. Our voices, upon &s;peaking or &s;inging, were redoubled to an a&s;toni&s;hing loudne&s;s; and upon the firing of a gun, the noi&s;e and re|verberations were almo&s;t deafening. In the mid&s;t of this grand amphitheatre ro&s;e a concretion of about fifteen feet high, that, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re&s;embled an altar; from which, taking the hint, we cau&s;ed ma&s;s to be celebrated there. The beautiful columns that &s;hot up round the altar, appeared like candle&s;ticks; and many other natural

objects repre&s;ented the cu&s;tomary ornaments of this rite."</P>
<P>"Below even this &s;pacious grotto there &s;eemed another cavern; down which I ventured with my former mariner, and de&s;cended about fifty paces by means of a rope. I at la&s;t arrived at a &s;mall &s;pot of level ground, where the bottom appeared different from that of the amphitheatre, being compo&s;ed of &s;oft clay, yielding to the pre&s;&s;ure, and and in which I thru&s;t a &s;tick to the depth of &s;ix feet. In this, however, as above, numbers of the mo&s;t beauti|ful cry&s;tals were formed; one of which, particularly, re&s;embled a table. Upon our egre&s;s from this amazing cavern, we perceived a Greek in&s;cription upon a rock at the mouth, but &s;o obliterated by time, that we could not read it di&s;tinctly. It &s;eemed to import that one Antipa|ter, in the time of Alexander, had come hither; but whether he penetrated into the depths of the cavern, he does not think fit to inform us."

Its motions were &s;o rapid, that per&s;ons who lay at their length, were to&s;&s;ed from &s;ide to &s;ide, as upon a rolling billow. The walls were da&s;hed from their foundations; and no fewer than fifty-four cities, with an incredible number of villages, were either de&s;troyed or greatly damaged. The city of Catanea, in particular, was utterly overthrown. A traveller, who was on his way thither, perceived, at the di&s;tance of &s;ome miles, a black cloud, like night, hanging over the place. The &s;ea, all of a &s;udden, began to roar; Mount Aetna to &s;end forth great &s;pires of flame; and &s;oon after a &s;hock en&s;ued, with a noi&s;e as if all the artillery in the world had been at once di&s;charged.

<HEAD>SECTION VII. On Charity.</HEAD>
<P>CHARITY is the &s;ame with benevolence or love; and is the term uniformly employed in the New Te&s;ta|ment, to denote all the good affections which we ought to bear towards one another. It con&s;i&s;ts not in &s;peculative ideas of general benevolence, floating in the head, and leaving the heart, as &s;peculations too often do, untouched and cold. Neither is it confined to that indolent good nature, which makes us re&s;t &s;atisfied with being free from inveterate malice, or ill-will to our fellow-creatures, without prompting us to be of &s;ervice to any. True charity is an active principle. It is not properly a &s;ingle virtue; but a di&s;po&s;ition re&s;iding in the heart, as a fountain whence all the virtues of benignity, candour, forberance, ge|nero&s;ity, compa&s;&s;ion, and liberality, flow, as &s;o many native &s;treams. From general good-will to all, it ex|tends its influence particularly to tho&s;e with whom we &s;tand in neare&s;t connexion, and who are directly within the &s;phere of our good offices. From the country or community to which we belong, it de|&s;cends to the &s;maller a&s;&s;ociations of neighbourhood, re|lations, and friends; and &s;preads it&s;elf over the whole circle of &s;ocial and dome&s;tic life. I mean not that it imports a promi&s;cuous undi&s;tingui&s;hing affection, which gives every man an equal title to our love, Charity, if we &s;hould endeavour to carry it &s;o far, would be ren|dered an impracticable virtue; and would re&s;olve it|&s;elf into mere words, without affecting the heart. True charity attempts not to &s;hut our eyes to the
<PB N="142" REF="038017_0142_1010D49B1A71E5C0">
di&s;tinction between good and bad men; nor to warm our hearts equally to tho&s;e who befriend, and tho&s;e who injure us. It re&s;erves our e&s;teem for good men, and our complacency for our friends. Towards our enemies it in&s;pires forgivene&s;s, humanity, and a &s;olici|tude for their welfare. It breaths univer&s;al candour, and liberality of &s;entiment. It forms gentlene&s;s of temper, and dictates affability of manners. It prompts corre&s;ponding &s;ympathies with them who rejoice, and them who weep. It teaches us to &s;light and de&s;pi&s;e no man. Charity is the comforter of the afflicted, the protector of the oppre&s;&s;ed, the reconciler of dif|ferences, the interce&s;&s;or for offenders. It is faithful|ne&s;s in the friend, public &s;pirit in the magi&s;trate, equity and patience in the judge, moderation in the &s;overeign, and loyalty in the &s;ubject. In parents, it is a care and attention; in children, it is reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. In a word, it is the &s;oul of &s;ocial life. It is the &s;un that en|livens and cheers the abodes of men. It is "like the dew of Hermon," &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, "and the dew that de&s;cendeth on the mountains of Zion, where the Lord commanded the ble&s;&s;ing, even life for ever more."</P>

While riotous indulgence enervates both the body and the mind, purity and virtue heighten all the powers of human fruition.</P>
<P>Feeble are all plea&s;ures in which the heart has no &s;hare. The &s;elfi&s;h gratifications of the bad, are both nar-now in their circle, and &s;hort in their duration. But pro&s;perity is redoubled to a good man, by his generous u&s;e of it. It is reflected back upon him from every one whom he makes happy. In the intercour&s;e of dome&s;tic affection, in the attachment of friends, the gratitude of dependents, the e&s;teem and good-will of all who know him, he &s;ees ble&s;&s;ings multiplied round him, on every &s;ide. "When the ear heard me, then it ble&s;&s;ed me; and when the eye &s;aw me, it gave witne&s;s to me: Be|cau&s;e I delivered the poor that cried, the fatherle&s;s, and him that had none to help him. The ble&s;&s;ing of him that was ready to peri&s;h came upon me, and I cau&s;ed the widow's heart to &s;ing with joy. I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame: I was a father to the poor; and the cau&s;e which I knew not, I &s;earched out." &mdash;Thus, while the righteous man flouri&s;hes like a tree planted by the rivers of water, he brings forth al&s;o his fruit in its &s;ea&s;on: And that fruit he brings forth, not for him&s;elf alone. He flouri&s;hes, not like a tree in &s;ome &s;olitary de&s;ert, which &s;catters its blo&s;&s;oms to the wind, and communicates neither fruit nor &s;hade to any living thing: but like a tree in the mid&s;t of an inhabited country, which to &s;ome fanta&s;tical affords friendly &s;helter, to others,

<HEAD>SECTION IX. On the beauties of the P&s;alms.</HEAD>
<P>GREATNESS confers no exemption from the cares and &s;orrows of life: its &s;hare of them frequently bears a me|lancholy proportion to its exultation. This the monarch of I&s;rael experienced. He &s;ought in piety, that peace which he could not find in empire; and alleviated the di&s;quietudes of &s;tate, with the exerci&s;es of devotion. His invaluable P&s;alms convey tho&s;e comforts to others, which they afforded to him&s;elf. Compo&s;ed upon particular oc|ca&s;ions, yet de&s;igned for general u&s;e; delivered out as &s;ervices for I&s;raelites under the Law, yet no le&s;s adapted to the circum&s;tances of Chri&s;tians under the Go&s;pel; they pre&s;ent religion to us in the mo&s;t engaging dre&s;s; communicating truths which philo&s;ophy could never in|ve&s;tigate, in a &s;tyle which poetry can never equal; while hi&s;tory is made the vehicle of prophecy, and creation lends all its charms to paint the glories of redemption. Cal|culated alike to profit and to plea&s;e, they inform the un|der&s;tanding, elevate the affections, and entertain the ima|genation. Indited under the influence of HIM, to whom all hearts are known, and all events foreknown, they &s;uit mankind in all &s;ituations; grateful as the manna which de&s;cended from above, and conformed it&s;elf to every palate.</P>

<P>And now, could the Author flatter him&s;elf, that any one would take half the plea&s;ure in reading his work, which he has taken in writing it, he would not fear the lo&s;s of his labour. The employment detached him from the bu&s;tle and hurry of life, the din of politics, and the noi&s;e of folly. Vanity and vexation flew away for a &s;ea&s;on; care and di&s;quietude came not near his dwelling.

Happier hours than tho&s;e which have been &s;pent in the&s;e meditations on the &s;ongs of Sion, he never expects to &s;ee in this world. Very plea&s;antly did they pa&s;s; they moved &s;moothly and &s;wift|ly along: for when thus engaged, he counted no time.

<P>Her &s;ingular talents for government were founded equally on her temper and on her capacity.

<HEAD>SECTION XIV. On Gentlene&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>I begin with di&s;tingui&s;hing true gentlene&s;s from pa&s;|&s;ive tamene&s;s of &s;pirit, and from unlimited compliance with the manners of others. That pa&s;&s;ive tamene&s;s, which &s;ubmits, without oppo&s;ition, to every encroachment of the violent and a&s;&s;uming, forms no part of Chri&s;tian duty; but, on the contrary, is de&s;tructive of general hap|pine&s;s and order. That unlimited complai&s;ance, which,
<PB N="153" REF="038017_0153_1010D4BF0125EE18">
on every occa&s;ion, falls in with the opinions and manners of others, is &s;o far from being a virtue, that it is it&s;elf a vice, and the parent of many vices. It overthrows all &s;teadine&s;s of principle; and produces that &s;inful conformi|ty with the world, which taints the whole character. In the pre&s;ent corrupted &s;tate of human manners, always to a&s;&s;ent and to comply, is the very wor&s;t maxim we can adopt. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport the purity and dignity of Chri&s;tian morals, without oppo&s;ing the world on va|rious occa&s;ions, even though we &s;hould &s;tand alone. That gentlene&s;s therefore which belongs to virtue, is to be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from the mean &s;pirit of cowards, and the fawning a&s;&s;ent of &s;ycophants. It renounces no ju&s;t right from fear. It gives up no important truth from flattery. It is indeed not only con&s;i&s;tent with a firm mind, but it nece&s;&s;arily requires a manly &s;pirit, and a fixed principle, in order to give it any real value. Upon this &s;olid ground only, the poli&s;h of gentlene&s;s can with advantage be &s;uperinduced.</P>
<P>It &s;tands oppo&s;ed, not to the mo&s;t determined regard for virtue and truth, but to har&s;hne&s;s and &s;everity, to pride and arogance, to violence and oppre&s;&s;ion. It is, proper|ly, that part of the great virtue of charity, which makes us unwilling to give pain to any of our brethren. Com|pa&s;&s;ion prompts us to relieve their wants. Forbearance prevents us from retaliating their injuries. Meekne&s;s re&s;trains our angry pa&s;&s;ions; candour, our &s;evere judg|ments. Gentlene&s;s corrects whatever is offen&s;ive in our manners; and, by a con&s;tant train of humane atten|tions, &s;tudies to alleviate the burden of common mi&s;ery. Its office, therefore, is exten&s;ive. It is not, like &s;ome other virtues, called forth only on peculiar emergencies;
<PB N="154" REF="038017_0154_1010D4C08BE34238">
but it is continually in action, when we are engaged in intercour&s;e with men. It ought to form our addre&s;s, to regulate our &s;peech, and to diffu&s;e it&s;elf over our whole behaviour.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not, however, confound this gentle "wi&s;|dom which is from above," with that artificial courte&s;y, that &s;tudied &s;moothne&s;s of manners, which is learned in the &s;chool of the world. Such accompli&s;hments, the mo&s;t frivolous and empty may po&s;&s;e&s;s. Too often they are employed by the artful, as a &s;nare; too often affec|ted by the hard and unfeeling, as a cover to the ba&s;e|ne&s;s of their minds. We cannot, at the &s;ame time, avoid ob&s;erving the homage, which, even in &s;uch in|&s;tances, the world is con&s;trained to pay to virtue. In order to render &s;ociety agreeable, it is found nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ume &s;omewhat, that may at lea&s;t carry its appear|ance. Virtue is the univer&s;al charm. Even its &s;ha|dow is courted, when the &s;ub&s;tance is wanting. The imitation of its form has been reduced into an art; and, in the commerce of life, the fir&s;t &s;tudy of all who would either gain the e&s;teem, or win the hearts of others, is to learn the &s;peech, and to adopt the manners, of candour, gentlene&s;s, and humanity. But that gentlene&s;s which is the characteri&s;tic of a good man, has, like every other virtue, its &s;eat in the heart; and let me add, no|thing except what flows from the heart, can render even external manners truly plea&s;ing. For no a&s;&s;umed be|haviour can at all times hide the real character. In that unaffectd civility which &s;prings from a gentle mind, there is a charm infinitely more powerful, than in all the &s;tudied manners of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed courtier.</P>
<P>True gentlene&s;s is founded on a &s;en&s;e of what we owe to HIM who made us, and to the common nature
<PB N="155" REF="038017_0155_1010D4C59CD52E08">
of which we all &s;hare. It ari&s;es from reflection on our own failings and wants; and from ju&s;t views of the condition, and the duty of man. It is native feeling, heightened and improved by principle. It is the heart which ea&s;ily relents; which feels for every thing that is human; and is backward and &s;low to inflict the lea&s;t wound. It is affable in its addre&s;s, and mild in its de|meanour; ever ready to oblige, and willing to de oblig|ed by others: breathing habitual kindne&s;s towards friends, courte&s;y to &s;trangers, long-&s;uffering to enemies. It exerci&s;es authority with moderation; admini&s;ters re|proof with tenderne&s;s; confers favours with ea&s;e and mode&s;ty. It is una&s;&s;uming in opinion, and temperate in zeal. It contends not eagerly about trifles; &s;low to contradict, and &s;till &s;lower to blame; but prompt to al|lay di&s;&s;ention, and to re&s;tore peace. It neither intermed|dles unnece&s;&s;arily with the affairs, nor pries inqui&s;itive|ly into the &s;ecrets of others. It delights above all things to alleviate di&s;tre&s;s; and, if it cannot dry up the falling tear, to &s;ooth at lea&s;t the grieving heart. Where it has not the power of being u&s;eful, it is never burden&s;ome. It &s;eeks to plea&s;e, rather than to &s;hine and dazzle; and conceals with care that &s;uperiority, either of talents, or of rank, which is oppre&s;&s;ive to tho&s;e who are beneath it. In a word, it is that &s;pirit and that tenour of man|ners, which the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t enjoins, when it com|mands us "to bear one onother's burdens; to rejoice with tho&s;e who rejoice, and to weep with tho&s;e who weep; to plea&s;e every one his neighbour for his good; to be kind and tender-hearted; to be pitiful and cour|teous; to &s;upport the weak, and to be patient towards all men"</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. Trial and Execution of the <HI>EARL</HI> of <HI>STRAFFORD,</HI> who fell a Sacrifice to the Violence of the Times, in the Reign of <HI>CHARLES</HI> the Fir&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>THE Earl of Strafford defended him&s;elf again&s;t the ac|cu&s;ations of the hou&s;e of Commons, with all the pre|&s;ence of mind, judgment, and &s;agacity, that could be expected from innocence and ability. His children were placed be&s;ide him, as he was thus defending his life, and the cau&s;e of his royal ma&s;ter. After he had, in a long and eloquent &s;qeech, delivered without pre-meditation, confuted all the accu&s;ations of his enemies, he thus drew to a conclu&s;ion. "But my Lords, I have troubled you too long: longer than I &s;hould have done, but for the &s;ake of the&s;e dear pledges, which a &s;aint in heaven has left me."&mdash;Upon this he pau&s;ed; dropped a tear; looked upon his children; and proceeded.&mdash; "What I forfeit for my&s;elf is a triflle: that my indi&s;|cretions &s;hould reach my po&s;terity, wounds me to the heart. Pardon my infirmity.&mdash;Something I &s;hould have added, but I am not able; and therefore I let it pa&s;s. And now, my lords, for my&s;elf, I have long been taught, that the afflictions of this life are overpaid by that eter|nal weight of glory, which awaits the innocent. And &s;o, my Lords, even &s;o, with the utmo&s;t tranquility,
<PB N="157" REF="038017_0157_1010D4CB58BF9628">
I &s;ubmit my&s;elf to your judgment, whether that judgment be life or death: not my will, but thine, O God, be done!"</P>
<P>His eloquence and innocence induced tho&s;e judges to pity, who were the mo&s;t zealous to condemn him. The King him&s;elf went to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and &s;poke for &s;ome time in his defence; but the &s;pirit of vengeance, which had been chained for eleven years, was now rou&s;ed; and nothing but his blood could give the people &s;atisfaction. He was condemned by both Hou&s;es of Parliament; and nothing remained but for the King to give his con&s;ent to the bill of attainder. But in the pre|&s;ent commotions, the con&s;ent of the King would very ea&s;ily be di&s;pen&s;ed with; and imminent danger might attend his refu&s;al. Charles, however, who loved Strafford tenderly, he&s;itated, and &s;eemed reluctant; trying every expedient to put off &s;o dreadful an office, as that of &s;igning the warrant for his execution. While he con|tinued in this agitation of mind, and &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, his doubts were at la&s;t &s;ilenced by an act of great magnani|mity in the condemned Lord. He received a letter from that unfortunate nobleman, de&s;iring that his life might be made a &s;acrifice to obtain reconciliation between the King and his people: adding, that he was prepared to die; and that to a willing mind there could be no injury. This in&s;tance of noble genero&s;ity was but ill repaid by his ma&s;ter, who complied with his reque&s;t. He con&s;ented to &s;ign the fatal bill by commi&s;&s;ion; and Strafford was beheaded on Tower-Hill; behaving with all that com|po&s;ed dignity of re&s;olution, which was expected from his character.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. An eminent In&s;tance of true Fortitude of Mind.</HEAD>
<P>ALL who have been di&s;tingui&s;hed as &s;ervants of God, or benefactors of men; all who, in perilous &s;ituations, have acted their part with &s;uch honour as to ren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their names illu&s;trious through &s;ucceeding ages, have been eminent for fortitude of mind. Of this we have one con|&s;picuous example in the Apo&s;tle Paul, whom it will be in&s;tructive for us to view in a remarkable occurrence of his life. After having long acted as the apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, his mi&s;&s;ion called him to go to Jeru&s;alem, where he knew that he was to encounter the utmo&s;t violence of his enemies. Ju&s;t before he &s;et &s;ail, he call|ed together the elders of his favourite church at Ephe|&s;us; and, in a pathetic &s;peech, which does great honour to his character, gave them his la&s;t farewell. Deeply affected by their knowledge of the certain dangers to which he was expo&s;ing him&s;elf, all the a&s;&s;embly were fill|ed with di&s;tre&s;s, and melted into tears. The cirm&s;tan|ces were &s;uch, as might have conveyed dejection even into a re&s;olute mind; and would have totally overwhelm|ed the feeble. "They all wept &s;ore, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell on Paul's neck, and ki&s;&s;ed him; &s;orrowing mo&s;t of all for the words which he &s;poke, that they &s;hould &s;ee his face no more." &mdash;What were then the &s;entiments, what was the lan|guage, of this great and good man? Hear the words which &s;poke his firm and undaunted mind. "Behold, I go bound in the &s;pirit, to Jeru&s;alem, not knowing the things that &s;hall befall me there; &s;ave that the Holy Spirit witne&s;&s;eth in every city, &s;aying, that bonds and afflictions

abide me. But none of the&s;e things move me; neither count I my life dear to my&s;elf, &s;o that I might fini&s;h my cour&s;e with joy, and the mini&s;try which I have received of the Lord Je&s;us, to te&s;tify the go&s;pel of the grace of God." There was uttered the voice, there breathed the &s;pirit, of a brave and a virtuous man. Such a man knows not what it is to &s;hrink from danger, when con|&s;cience points out his path. In that path he is deter|mined to walk; let the con&s;equences be what they may.</P>
<P>This was the magnanimous behaviour of that great Apo&s;tle, when he had per&s;ecution and di&s;tre&s;s full in view. Attend now to the &s;entiments of the &s;ame excellent man, when the time of his la&s;t &s;uffering approached; and re|mark the maje&s;ty, and the ea&s;e, with which he looked on death. "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight. I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e. I have kept the faith. Hence|forth there is laid up for me a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s." How many years of life does &s;uch a dying moment over-balance? Who would not choo&s;e, in this manner, to go off the &s;tage, with &s;uch a &s;ong of triumph in his mouth, rathar than prolong his exi&s;tence through a wretched old age, &s;tained with &s;in and &s;hame?</P>

<P>THE religion of Chri&s;t not only arms us with forti|tude again&s;t the approach of evil; but, &s;uppo&s;ing evils to fall upon us with their heavie&s;t pre&s;&s;ure, it lightens the

load by many con&s;olations to which others are &s;trangers. While bad men trace, in the calamities with which they are vi&s;ited, the hand of an offended &s;overeign, Chri&s;tians are taught to view them as the well-intended cha&s;ti&s;e|ments of a merciful Father. They hear amid&s;t them, that &s;till voice which a good con&s;cience brings to their ear: "Fear not, for I am with thee; be not di&s;mayed, for I am thy God." They apply to them&s;elves the com|fortable promi&s;es with which the go&s;pel abounds. They di&s;cover in the&s;e the happy i&s;&s;ue decreed to their troubles; and wait with patience till Providence &s;hall have accom|pli&s;hed its great and good de&s;igns. In the mean time, Devotion opens to them its ble&s;&s;ed and holy &s;anctuary: That &s;anctuary in which the wounded heart is healed, and the weary mind is at re&s;t; where the cares of the world are forgotten, where its tumults are hu&s;hed, and its mi&s;eries di&s;appear; where greater objects open to our view than any which the world pre&s;ents; where a more &s;erene &s;ky &s;hines, and a &s;weeter and calmer light beams on the afflicted heart. In tho&s;e moments of devotion, a pious man pouring out his wants and &s;orrows to an al|mighty Supporter, feels that he is not left &s;olitary and for&s;aken in a vale of woe. God is with him; Chri&s;t and the Holy Spirit are with him; and, though he &s;hould be bereaved of every friend on earth, he can look up in hea|ven to a Friend that will never de&s;ert him.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. The Clo&s;e of Life.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we contemplate the clo&s;e of life; the termina|tion of man's de&s;igns and hopes; the &s;ilence that now reigns among tho&s;e who, a little while ago, were &s;o bu&s;y, or &s;o gay; who can avoid being touched with &s;en&s;ations at once awful and tender? What heart but then warms with the glow of humanity? In who&s;e eye does not the tear gather, on revolving the fate of pa&s;&s;ing and &s;hort-lived man?</P>
<P>Behold the poor man who lays down at la&s;t the bur|den of his weari&s;ome life. No more &s;hall he groan un|der the load of poverty and toil. No more &s;hall he hear the in&s;olent calls of the ma&s;ter, from whom he received his &s;canty wages. No more &s;hall he be rai&s;ed from need|ful &s;lumber on his bed of &s;traw, nor be hurried away from his homely meal, to undergo the repeated labours of the day. While his humble grave is preparing, and a few poor and decayed neighbours are carrying him thither, it is good for us to think, that this man too was our brother; that for him the aged and de&s;titute wife, and the needy children, now weep; that, neglected as he was by the world, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed perhaps both a &s;ound un|der&s;tanding, and a worthy heart; and is now carried by angels to re&s;t in Abraham's bo&s;om.&mdash;At no great di&s;tance from him, the grave is opened to receive the rich and proud man.

While the funeral is at|tended by a numerous unconcerned company, who are di&s;cour&s;ing to one another about the news of the day, or the ordinary affairs of life, let our thoughts rather follow to the hou&s;e of mourning, and repre&s;ent to them|&s;elves what is pa&s;&s;ing there. There we &s;hould &s;ee a di&s;con&s;olate family, &s;itting in &s;ilent grief, thinking of the &s;ad breach that is made in their little &s;ociety; and, with tears in their eyes, looking to the chamber that is now left vacant, and to every memorial that pre&s;ents it|&s;elf of their departed friend. By &s;uch attention to the woes of others, the &s;elfi&s;h hardne&s;s of our hearts will be gradually &s;oftened, and melted down into humanity.</P>
<P>Another day, we follow to the grave, one who, in old age, and after a long career of life, has in full ma|turity &s;unk at la&s;t into re&s;t.

He has &s;een peace and war &s;ucceeding in their turns; the face of his country un|dergoing many alterations; and the very city in which he dwelt ri&s;ing, in a manner, new around him.

<HEAD>SECTION VI. The Clemency and amiable Character of the Patriarch JOSEPH.</HEAD>
<P>NO human character exhibited in the records of Scrip|ture, is more remarkable or in&s;tructive than that of the patriarch Jo&s;eph. He is one whom we behold tried in all the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune; from the condition of a &s;lave, ri&s;ing to be ruler of the land of Egypt; and in every &s;ta|tion acquiring, by his virtue and wi&s;dom, favour with God and man. When over&s;eer of Potiphar's hou&s;e, his fidelity was proved by &s;trong temptations, which he ho|nourably re&s;i&s;ted. When thrown into pri&s;on by the ar|tifice of a fal&s;e woman, his integrity and prudence &s;oon rendered him con&s;picuous, even in that dark man&s;ion. When called into the pre&s;ence of Pharaoh, the wi&s;e and and exten&s;ive plan which he formed for &s;aving the king|dom from the mi&s;eries of impending famine, ju&s;tly rai&s;ed him to a high &s;tation, wherein his abilities were eminently di&s;played in the public &s;ervice. But in his whole hi&s;tory, there is no circum&s;tance &s;o &s;triking and intere&s;ting, as his behaviour to his brethren who had &s;old him into &s;lavery. The moment in which he made him&s;elf known to them, was the mu&s;t critical one of his life, and the mo&s;t deci|&s;ive of his character. It is &s;uch as rarely occu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in the cour&s;e of human events; and is calculated to draw the
<PB N="166" REF="038017_0166_1010D4E803B4BB00">
highe&s;t attention of all who are endowed with any degree of &s;en&s;ibility of heart.</P>
<P>From the whole tenour of the narration it appears, that though Jo&s;eph, upon the arrival of his brethren in Egypt, made him&s;elf &s;trange to them, yet from the be|ginning he intended to di&s;cover him&s;elf; and &s;tudied &s;o to conduct the di&s;covery, as might render the &s;urpri&s;e of joy complete. For this end, by affected &s;everity, he took mea&s;ures for bringing down into Egypt all his father's children. They were now arrived there; and Benja|min among the re&s;t, who was his younger brother by the &s;ame mother, and was particularly beloved by Jo&s;eph. Him he threatened to detain; and &s;eemed willing to al|low the re&s;t to depart. This incident renewed their di&s;|tre&s;s. They all knew their father's extreme anxiety about the &s;afety of Benjamin, and with what difficulty he had yielded to his undertaking this journey. Should he be prevented from returning, they dreaded that grief would overpower the old man's &s;pirits, and prove fatal to his life. Judah, therefore, who had particularly urged the nece&s;&s;ity of Benjamin's accompanying his brothers, and had &s;olemnly pledged him&s;elf to their father for his &s;afe return, craved, upon this occa&s;ion, an audience of the governour; and gave him a full account of the cir|cum&s;tances of Jacob's family.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more intere&s;ting and pathetic than this di&s;cour&s;e of Judah. Little knowing to whom he &s;poke, he paints in all the colours of &s;imple and natural eloquence, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of the aged patriarch, ha&s;tening to the clo&s;e of life; long afflicted for the lo&s;s of a favourite &s;on, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to have been torn in pieces by a bea&s;t of prey; labouring now under anxi|ous
<PB N="167" REF="038017_0167_1010D4ED1FFF6FD0">
concern about his younge&s;t &s;on, the child of his old age, who alone was left alive of his mother, and whom nothing but the calamities of &s;evere famine could have moved a tender father to &s;end from home, and expo&s;e to the dangers of a foreign land. "If we bring him not back with us, we &s;hall bring down the grey hairs of thy &s;ervant, our father, with &s;orrow, to the grave. I pray thee therefore let thy &s;ervant abide, in&s;tead of the young man, a bondman to our lord. For how &s;hall I go up to my father, and Benjamin not with me? le&s;t I &s;ee the evil that &s;hall come on my father."</P>
<P>Upon this relation, Jo&s;eph could no longer re&s;train him&s;elf. The tender ideas of his father and his father's hou&s;e, of his ancient home, his country and his kindred, of the di&s;tre&s;s of his family, and his own exaltation, all ru&s;hed too &s;trongly upon his mind to bear any farther concealment. "He cried, cau&s;e every man to go out from me; and he wept aloud." The tears which he &s;hed were not the tears of grief. They were the bur&s;t of affection. They were the effu&s;ions of a heart overflowing with all the tender &s;en&s;ibilites of nature. Formerly he had been moved in the &s;ame manner, when he fir&s;t &s;aw his brethren before him. "His bowels yearned upon them; he &s;ought for a place where to weep. He went into his chamber; and then wa&s;hed his face and returned to them." At that period his generous plans were not completed. But now, when there was no farther occa&s;ion for con|&s;training him&s;elf, he gave free vent to the &s;trong emo|tions of his heart. The fir&s;t mini&s;ter to the king of Egypt was not a&s;hamed to &s;how, that he felt as a man, and a brother. "He wept aloud; and the Egyptians, and the hou&s;e of Pharaoh heard him."</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="038017_0168_1010D4EEAA3C1688">The fir&s;t words which his &s;welling heart allowed him to pronounce, are the mo&s;t &s;uitable to &s;uch an affecting &s;ituation that were ever uttered; &mdash;"I am Jo&s;eph; doth my father yet live?"&mdash;What could he, what ought he, in that impa&s;&s;ionate moment, to have &s;aid more? This is the voice of Nature her&s;elf, &s;peaking her own language; and it penetrates the heart: No pomp of expre&s;&s;ion; no parade of kindne&s;s, but &s;trong affection ha&s;tening to utter what it &s;trongly felt. "His brethren could not an&s;wer him; for they were troubled at his pre&s;ence." Their &s;ilence is as expre&s;&s;ive of tho&s;e emotions of repentance and &s;hame, which, on this amazing di&s;covery, filled their brea&s;ts, and &s;topped their utterance, as the few words which Jo&s;eph &s;peaks, are expre&s;&s;ive of the generous agitations which &s;truggled for vent within him. No painter could &s;eize a more &s;triking moment for di&s;play|ing the characteri&s;tical features of the human heart, than what is here pre&s;ented. Never was there a &s;ituation of more tender and virtuous joy, on the one hand; nor, on the other, of more overwhelming confu&s;ion and con&s;cious guilt. In the &s;imple narration of the &s;acred hi&s;torian, it is &s;et before us with the greater energy and higher effect, than if it had been wrought up with all the colouring of the mo&s;t admired modern eloquence.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII. ALTAMONT. The following account of an affecting exit is related by Dr. Young, who was pre&s;ent at the melancholy &s;cene.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ad evening before the death of that noble youth, who&s;e la&s;t hours &s;ugge&s;ted the&s;e thoughts, I was with him. No one was there, but his phy&s;ician, and an in|timate whom he loved, and whom he had ruined. At my coming in, he &s;aid,&mdash;"you and the phy&s;ician are come too late.&mdash;I have neither life nor hope. You both aim at miracles. You would rai&s;e the dead!"</P>
<P>Heaven, I &s;aid, was merciful&mdash;"Or," exclaimed he,&mdash; "I could not have been thus guilty. What has it not done to ble&s;s, and to &s;ave me?&mdash;I have been too &s;trong for omnipotence! I have plucked down ruin."&mdash;I &s;aid, the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer&punc; &mdash;"Hold! hold! you wound me!&mdash; That is the rock on which I &s;plit&mdash;I denied his name!"</P>
<P>Refu&s;ing to hear any thing from me, or take any thing from the phy&s;ician, he lay &s;ilent, as far as &s;udden darts of pain would permit, till the clock &s;truck: Then with vehemence;&mdash;"Oh! time! time! it is fit thou &s;hould&s;t thus &s;trike thy murderer to the heart!&mdash;How art thou fled forever!&mdash;A month!&mdash;Oh, for a &s;ingle week! I a&s;k not for years; though an age were too little for the much I have to do."</P>
<P>On my &s;aying, we could not do too much: that hea|ven was a ble&s;&s;ed place&mdash;</P>
<P>"So much the wor&s;e.&mdash;'Tis lo&s;t! 'tis lo&s;t!&mdash;Heaven is to me the &s;evere&s;t part of hell!"</P>
<P>Soon after I propo&s;ed prayer. "Pray you that can. I never prayed. I cannot pray:&mdash;Nor need I. Is not

Heaven on my &s;ide already? It clo&s;es with my con&s;cience. Its &s;evere&s;t &s;trokes but &s;econd my own."</P>
<P>His friend being much touched, even to tears at this&mdash; (who could forbear? I could not)&mdash;with a mo&s;t affec|tionate look, he &s;aid, "Keep tho&s;e tears for thy&s;elf. I have undone thee.&mdash;Do&s;t weep for me? that's cruel. What can pain me more?"</P>
<P>Here his friend too much affected, would have left him.&mdash;"No, &s;tay&mdash;thou &s;till may&s;t hope;&mdash;therefore hear me. How madly have I talk'd! How madly ha&s;t thou li&s;tened, and believed! but look on my pre&s;ent &s;tate, as a full an&s;wer to thee, and to my&s;elf. This body is all weakne&s;s and pain; but my &s;oul, as if &s;tung up by torment to greater &s;trength and &s;pirit, is full powerful to rea&s;on; full mighty to &s;uffer. And that, which thus tri|umphs within the jaws of immortality, is, doubtle&s;s, im|mortal&mdash;And, as for a Deity, nothing le&s;s than an Al|mighty could inflict what I feel."</P>
<P>I was about to congratulate this pa&s;&s;ive, involuntary confe&s;&s;or, on his a&s;&s;erting the two prime articles of his creed, extorted by the rack of nature, when he thus, very pa&s;&s;ionately:&mdash;"No, no! let me &s;peak on. I have not long to &s;peak.&mdash;My much injured friend! my &s;oul, as my body, lies in ruins; in &s;cattered fragments of bro|ken thought&mdash;Remor&s;e for the pa&s;t, throws my thought on the future. Wor&s;e dread of the future, &s;trikes it back on the pa&s;t. I turn, and turn, and find no ray. Did&s;t thou feel half the mountain that is on me, thou would&s;t &s;truggle with the martyr for his &s;take; and ble&s;s Heaven for the flames!&mdash;that is not an everla&s;ting flame; that is not an unquenchable fire."</P>
<P>How were we &s;truck! yet, &s;oon after, &s;till more.
<PB N="171" REF="038017_0171_1010D4FAA0E50928" MS="y">
With what an eye of di&s;traction, what a face of de&s;pair! he cried out:&mdash;"My principles have poi&s;oned my friend; my extravagance has beggared my boy! my unkindne&s;s has murdered my wife!&mdash;And is there another hell?&mdash; Oh! thou bla&s;phemed, yet indulgent LORD GOD! Hell it&s;elf is a refuge, if it hide me from thy frown!"</P>
<P>Soon after his under&s;tanding failed. His terrified ima|gination uttered horrors not to be repeated, or ever for|gotten. And ere the &s;un (which, I hope, has &s;een, few like him) aro&s;e, the gay, young, noble, ingenious, ac|compli&s;hed, and mo&s;t wretched Altamont, expired!</P>
<P>If this is a man of plea&s;ure, what is a man of pain? How quick, how total, is their tran&s;it! In what a di&s;mal gloom they &s;et for ever! How &s;hort, alas! the day of their rejoicing!&mdash;For a moment they glitter&mdash;they daz|zle. In a moment, where are they? Oblivion covers their memories. Ah! would it did! Infamy &s;natches them from oblivion. In the long-living annals of infa|my their triumphs are recorded. Thy &s;ufferings &s;till bleed in the bo&s;om, poor Altamont! of the heart-&s;tricken friend&mdash;for Altamont had a friend. He might have had many. His tran&s;ient morning might have been the dawn of an immortal day. His name might have been gloriou&s;ly enrolled in the records of eternity. His me|mory might have left a &s;weet fragrance behind it, grate|ful to the &s;urviving friend, &s;alutary to the &s;ucceeding ge|neration. With what capacities was he endowed! with what advantages, for being greatly good! But with the talents of an angel, a man may be a fool. If he judges ami&s;s in the &s;upreme point, judging right in all el&s;e, but aggravates his folly; as it &s;hows him wrong, though ble&s;&s;ed with the be&s;t capacity of being right.</P>

the mind, to &s;ee what it could do, and what it could not; to re&s;train it from efforts beyond its ability; but to teach it how to advance as far as the faculties given to it by na|ture, with the utmo&s;t exertion and mo&s;t proper culture of them, would allow it to go. In the va&s;t ocean of phi+lo&s;ophy, I had the line and the plummet always in my hands. Many of its depths I found my&s;elf unable to fathom; but, by caution in &s;ounding, and the careful ob|&s;ervations I made in the cour&s;e of my voyage, I found out &s;ome truths of &s;o much u&s;e to mankind, that they acknowledge me to have been their benefactor.</P>

<P>THE time is come, Fathers, when that which has long been wi&s;hed for, towards allaying the envy your order has been &s;ubject to, and removing the imputations again&s;t trials, is effectually put in your power. An opinion has long prevailed, not only here at home, but likewi&s;e in foreign countries, both dangerous to you, and perni|cious to the &s;tate,&mdash;, that, in pro&s;ecutions, men of wealth are always &s;afe, however clearly convicted. There is now to be brought upon his trial before you, to the con|fu&s;ion, I hope, of the propagators of this &s;landerous impu|tation, one who&s;e life and actions condemn him in the opinion of all impartial per&s;ons; but who, according to his own reckoning and declared dependence upon his riches, is already acquitted; I mean Caius Verres. I demand ju&s;tice of you, Fathers, upon the robber of the public trea&s;ury, the oppre&s;&s;or of A&s;ia Minor and Pam|phylia, the invader of the rights and privileges of Ro|mans, the &s;courge and cur&s;e of Sicily. If that &s;entence is pa&s;&s;ed upon him which his crimes de&s;erve, your au|thority, Fathers, will be venerable and &s;acred in the eyes
<PB N="190" REF="038017_0190_1010D5338F430350">
of the public; but if his great riches &s;hould bias you in his favour, I &s;hall &s;till gain one point,&mdash;to make it appa|rent to all the world, that what was wanting in this ca&s;e, was not a criminal nor a pro&s;ecutor, but ju&s;tice and ade|quate puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>To pa&s;s over the &s;hameful irregularities of his youth, what does his quae&s;tor&s;hip, the fir&s;t public employment he held, what does it exhibit, but one continued &s;cene of villanies? Cneius Carbo plundered of the public money by his own trea&s;urer, a con&s;ul &s;tripped and betrayed, an army de&s;erted and reduced to want, a province robbed, the civil and religious rights of a people violated. The employment he held in A&s;ia Minor and Pamphylia, what did it produce but the ruin of tho&s;e countries? in which, hou&s;es, cities, and temples were robbed by him. What was his conduct in his praetor&s;hip here at home? Let the plundered temples, and public works neglected, that he might embezz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the money intended for carrying them on, bear witne&s;s. How did he di&s;charge the office of a judge? Let tho&s;e who &s;uffered by his inju&s;tice an&s;wer. But his praetor&s;hip in Sicily crowns all his works of wickedne&s;s, and fini&s;hes a la&s;ting monument to his infa|my. The mi&s;chiefs done by him in that unhappy coun|try, during the three years of his iniquitous admini&s;tra|tion, are &s;uch, that many years, under the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of praetors, will not be &s;ufficient to re&s;tore things to the condition in which he found them: for it is notorious, that, during the time of his tyranny, the Sicilians neither enjoyed the protection of their own original laws; of the regulations made for their benefit by the Roman &s;e|nate, upon their coming under the protection of the com|monwealth; nor of the natural and unalienable rights of
<PB N="191" REF="038017_0191_1010D5382448AA70">
men. His nod has decided all cau&s;es in Sicily for the&s;e three years. And his deci&s;ions have broken all law, all precedent, all right. The &s;ums he has, by arbitrary taxes and unheard of impo&s;itions, extorted from the indu&s;tri|ous poor, are not to be computed. The mo&s;t faithful allies of the commonwealth have been treated as enemies. Roman citizens have, like &s;laves, been put to death with tortures. The mo&s;t atrocious criminals, for money, have been exempted from the de&s;erved puni&s;hments; and men of the mo&s;t unexceptionable characters, condemned and bani&s;hed unheard. The harbours, though &s;ufficiently fortified, and the gates of &s;trong towns, have been opened to pirates and ravagers. The &s;oldiery and &s;ailors, be|longing to a province under the protection of the com|monwealth, have been &s;tarved to death. Whole fleets, to the great detriment of the province, &s;uffered to peri&s;h. The ancient monuments of either Sicilian or Roman greatne&s;s, the &s;tatues of heroes and princes have been car|ried off; and the temples &s;tripped of the images.&mdash;Hav|ing, by his iniquitous &s;entences, filled the pri&s;ons with the mo&s;t indu&s;trious and de&s;erving of the people, he then proceeded to order numbers of Roman citizens to be &s;trangled in the gaols: &s;o that the exclamation, "I am a citizen of Rome!" which has often, in the mo&s;t di&s;tant regions, and among the mo&s;t barbarous people, been a protection, was of no &s;ervice to them; but, on the con|trary, brought a &s;peedier and more &s;evere puni&s;hment upon them.</P>
<P>I a&s;k now, Verres, what thou ha&s;t to advance again&s;t this charge? Wilt thou pretend to deny it? Wilt thou pretend, that any thing fal&s;e, that even any thing aggra|vated,
<PB N="192" REF="038017_0192_1010D53CECACFF18">
is alleged again&s;t thee? Had any prince, or any &s;tate, committed the &s;ame outrage again&s;t the privilege of Roman citizens, &s;hould we not think we had &s;ufficient ground for demanding &s;atisfaction? What puni&s;hment ought, then, to be inflicted upon a tyrannical and wicked praetor, who dared, at no greater di&s;tance than Sicily, within &s;ight of the Italian coa&s;t, to put to the infamous death of crucifixion, that unfortunate and innocent citi|zen, Publius Gavius Co&s;anus, only for his having a&s;&s;erted his privilege of citizen&s;hip, and declared his intention of appealing to the ju&s;tice of his country, again&s;t a cruel oppre&s;&s;or, who had unju&s;tly confined him in pri&s;on at Syracu&s;e, whence he had ju&s;t made his e&s;cape? The unhappy man, arre&s;ted as he was going to embark for his native country, is brought before the wicked praetor. With eyes darting fury, and a countenance di&s;torted with cruelty, he orders the helple&s;s victim of his rage to be &s;tripped, and rods to be brought; accu&s;ing him, but with|out the lea&s;t &s;hadow of evidence, or even of &s;u&s;picion, of having come to Sicily as a &s;py. It was in vain that the unhappy man cried out, "I am a Roman citizen: I have &s;erved under Lucius Pretius, who is now at Pano|ramus, and will atte&s;t my innocence." The blood-thir&s;ty praetor, deaf to all he could urge in his own de|fence, ordered the infamous puni&s;hment to be inflicted. Thus, Fathers, was an innocent Roman citizen publicly mangled with &s;courging; whil&s;t the only words he ut|tered, amid&s;t his cruel &s;ufferings, were, "I am a Roman citizen!" With the&s;e he hoped to defend him&s;elf from violence and infamy. But of &s;o little &s;ervice was this pri|vilege to him, that, while he was thus a&s;&s;erting his citi|zen&s;hip,
<PB N="193" REF="038017_0193_1010D53E73B142D8">
the order was given for his execution,&mdash;for his execution upon the cro&s;s!&mdash;</P>
<P>O liberty!&mdash;O &s;ound once delightful to every Roman ear!&mdash;O &s;acred privilege of Roman citizen&s;hip!&mdash;once &s;acred!&mdash;how trampled upon!&mdash;But what then! Is it come to this? Shall an inferior magi&s;trate, a governor, who holds his whole power of the Roman people, in a Roman province, within &s;ight of Italy, bind, &s;courge, torture with fire and red hot plates of iron, and at la&s;t put to the infamous death of the cro&s;s, a Roman citizen? Shall neither the cries of innocence expiring in agony, nor the tears of pitying &s;pectators, nor the maje&s;ty of the Roman commonwealth, nor the fear of the ju&s;tice of his country, re&s;train the licentious and wanton cruelty of a mon&s;ter, who, in confidence of his riches, &s;trikes at the root of liberty, and &s;ets mankind at defiance.</P>
<P>I conclude with expre&s;&s;ing my hopes, that your wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice, Fathers, will not, by &s;uffering the atrocious and unexampled in&s;olence of Caius Verres to e&s;cape due puni&s;hment, leave room to apprehend the danger of a total &s;ubver&s;ion of authority, and the introduction of ge|neral anarchy and confu&s;ion.</P>

Thus, Fathers, your kindne&s;s to our family is defeated; and Jugurtha, in injuring me, throws contempt upon you.</P>
<P>O wretched prince! Oh cruel rever&s;e of fortune! Oh father Micip&s;a! is this the con&s;equence of thy genero&s;ity; that he, whom thy goodne&s;s rai&s;ed to an equality with thy own children, &s;hould be the murderer of thy children? Mu&s;t, then, the royal hou&s;e of Numidia always be a &s;cene of havock and blood? While Carthage remained, we &s;uffered, as was to be expected, all &s;orts of hard&s;hips from their ho&s;tile attacks; our enemy near; our only powerfull ally, the Roman commonwealth, at a di&s;tance. When that &s;courge of Africa was no more, we congra|tulated our&s;elves on the pro&s;pect of e&s;tabli&s;hed peace. But, in&s;tead of peace, behold the kingdom of Numidia drenched with royal blood! and the only &s;urviving &s;on of its late king, flying from an adopted murderer, and &s;eeking that &s;afety in foreign parts, which he cannot command in his own kingdom.</P>
<P>Whither&mdash;Oh! whither &s;hall I fly? If I return to the royal palace of my ance&s;tors, my father's throne is &s;eized by the murderer of my brother. What can I there expect, but that Jugurtha &s;hould ha&s;ten to imbrue, in my blood, tho&s;e hands which are now reeking with

my brother's? If I were to fly for refuge, or for a&s;&s;i&s;|tance, to any other court, from what prince can I hope for protection, if the Roman commonwealth give me up? From my own family o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> friends I have no expectations. My royal father is no more. He is beyond the reach of violence, and out of hearing of the complaints of his unhappy &s;on. Were my brother alive, our mutual &s;ym|pathy would be &s;ome alleviation. But he is hurried out of life, in his early youth, by the very hand which &s;hould have been the la&s;t to injure any of the royal family of Numidia. The bloody Jugurtha has butchered all whom he &s;u&s;pected to be in my intere&s;t. Some have been de|&s;troyed by the lingering torment of the cro&s;s. Others have been given a prey to wild bea&s;ts; and their angui&s;h made the &s;port of men more cruel than wild bea&s;ts. If there be any yet alive, they are &s;hut up in dungeons, there to drag out a life more intolerable than death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Look down, illu&s;trious &s;enators of Rome! from that height of power to which you are rai&s;ed, on the unex|ampled di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a prince, who is, by the cruelty of a wicked intruder, become an outca&s;t from all mankind.

<P>Oh murdered, butchered brother! Oh deare&s;t to my heart&mdash;now gone forever from my &s;ight!&mdash;but why &s;hould I lament his death? He is, indeed, deprived of the ble&s;&s;ed light of heaven, of life, and kingdom, at once, by the very per&s;on who ought to have been the fir&s;t to hazard his own life, in defence of any one of Micip&s;a's family. But, as things are, my brother is not &s;o much deprived of the&s;e comforts, as delivered from terror, from flight, from exile, and the endle&s;s train of mi&s;eries which render life to me a burden. He lies full low, gored with wounds, and fe&s;tering in his own blood. But he lies in peace. He feels none of the mi&s;eries which rend my &s;oul with agony and di&s;traction, while I am &s;et up a &s;pectacle to all mankind, of the uncertainty of hu|man affairs. So far from having it in my power to pu|ni&s;h his murderer, I am not ma&s;ter of the means of &s;ecur|ing my own life. So far from being in a condition to de|fend my kingdom from the violence of the u&s;urper, I am obliged to apply for foreign protection for my own per&s;on.</P>

<P>I think my&s;elf happy, king Agrippa, becau&s;e I &s;hall an&s;wer for my&s;elf this day before thee, concerning all the things whereof I am accu&s;ed by the Jews: e&s;pecially, as I know thee to be expert in all cu&s;toms and que&s;tions which are among the Jews. Wherefore I be&s;eech thee to hear me patiently.</P>
<P>My manner of life from my youth, which was at the fir&s;t among my own nation at Jeru&s;alem, know all the Jews; who knew me from the beginning, (if they would te&s;tify,) that after the &s;traite&s;t &s;ect of our religion, I lived a Phari&s;ee.

<P>Why &s;hould it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God &s;hould rai&s;e the dead? I verily thought with my&s;elf, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Je&s;us of Nazareth: and this I did in Jeru&s;alem. Many of the &s;aints I &s;hut up in pri&s;on, having received authority from the chief prie&s;ts, and when they were put to death, I gave my voice again&s;t them.

<HEAD>SECTION IV. <HI>LORD MANSFIELD's</HI> Speech in the Hou&s;e of Peers, <HI>1770,</HI> on the Bill of preventing the Delays of Ju&s;tice, by claiming the Privilege of Parliament.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I con&s;ider the importance of this bill to your Lord&s;hips, I am not &s;urpri&s;ed it has taken up &s;o much of your con&s;ideration. It is a bill, indeed, of no common magnitude; it is no le&s;s than to take away from two thirds of the legi&s;lative body of this great kingdom, certain privileges and immunities of which they have been long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Perhaps there is no &s;ituation the human mind can be placed in, that is &s;o difficult and &s;o trying, as when it is made a judge in its own cau&s;e. There is &s;ome|thing implanted in the brea&s;t of man &s;o attached to &s;elf, &s;o tenacious of privileges once obtained, that in &s;uch a &s;ituation, either to di&s;cu&s;s with impartiality, or decide with ju&s;tice, has ever been held the &s;ummit of all hu|man virtue. The bill now in que&s;tion puts your Lord|&s;hips in this very predicament; and I doubt not but the wi&s;dom of your deci&s;ion will convince the world, that where &s;elf-intere&s;t and ju&s;tice are in oppo&s;ite &s;cales, the latter will ever preponderate with your Lord&s;hips.</P>
<P>Privileges have been granted to legi&s;lators in all ages, and in all countries. The practice is founded in wi&s;dom; and, indeed, it is peculiarly e&s;&s;ential to the con&s;titution of this country, that the members of both Hou&s;es &s;hould be free in their per&s;ons, in ca&s;es of civil &s;uits: for there may come a time when the &s;afety and welfare
<PB N="202" REF="038017_0202_1010C73E432DFED0">
of this whole empire, may depend upon their attendance in parliament. I am far from advi&s;ing any mea&s;ure that would in future endanger the &s;tate: but the bill be|fore your Lord&s;hips has, I am confident, no &s;uch tenden|cy; for it expre&s;sly &s;ecures the per&s;ons of members of either Hou&s;e in all civil &s;uits. This being the ca&s;e, I confe&s;s, when I &s;ee many noble Lords, for who&s;e judg|ment I have a very great re&s;pect, &s;tanding up to oppo&s;e a bill which is calculated merely to facilitate the reco|very of ju&s;t and legal debts, I am a&s;toni&s;hed and amazed. They, I doubt not, oppo&s;e the bill upon public princi|ples: I would not wi&s;h to in&s;inuate, that private intere&s;t had the lea&s;t weight in their determination.</P>
<P>The bill has been frequently propo&s;ed, and as fre|quently has mi&s;carried: but it was always lo&s;t in the lower Hou&s;e. Little did I think, when it had pa&s;&s;ed the Commons, that it po&s;&s;ibly could have met with &s;uch oppo&s;ition here. Shall it be &s;aid, that you, my Lords, the grand council of the nation, the highe&s;t judicial and legi&s;lative body of the realm, endeavour to evade, by privilege, tho&s;e very laws which you enforce on your fellow-&s;ubjects? Forbid it ju&s;tice!&mdash;I am &s;ure, were the noble Lords as well acquainted as I am, with but half the difficulties and delays occa&s;ioned in the courts of ju&s;tice, under pretence of privilege, they would not, nay they could not, oppo&s;e this bill.</P>
<P>I have waited with patience to hear what arguments might be urged again&s;t the bill; but I have waited in vain: the truth is, there is no argument that can weigh again&s;t it. The ju&s;tice and expediency of the bill are &s;uch as render it &s;elf-evident. It is a propo&s;ition of that nature, that can neither be weakened by argument,
<PB N="203" REF="038017_0203_1010C73FF80FBAF8">
nor entangled with &s;ophi&s;try. Much, indeed, has been &s;aid by &s;ome noble Lords, on the wi&s;dom of our ance&s;tors, and how differently they thought from us. They not only decreed, that privilege &s;hould prevent all civil &s;uits from proceeding during the &s;itting of parliament, but likewi&s;e granted protection to the very &s;ervants of mem|bers. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing on the wi&s;dom of our ance&s;|tors; it might perhaps appear invidious: that is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that the no|ble Lords who flatter them&s;elves with the weight of that reflection, &s;hould remember, that as circum&s;tances alter, things them&s;elves &s;hould alter. Formerly, it was not &s;o fa&s;hionable either for ma&s;ters or &s;ervants to run in debt, as it is at pre&s;ent. Formerly, we were not that great commercial nation we are at pre&s;ent; nor formerly were merchants and manufacturers members parliament, as at pre&s;ent. The ca&s;e is now very different: both mer|chants and manufacturers are, with great propriety, elect|ed members of the Lower Hou&s;e. Commerce having thus got into the legi&s;lative body of the kingdom, privi|lege mu&s;t be done away. We all know, that the very &s;oul and e&s;&s;ence of trade are regular payments; and &s;ad experience teaches us, that there are men, who will not make their regular payments without the compul&s;ive power of the laws. The law then ought to be equally open to all. Any exemption to particular men, or par|ticular ranks of men, is, in a free and commercial coun|try, a &s;oleci&s;m of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t nature.</P>
<P>But I will not trouble your Lord&s;hips with arguments for that, which is &s;ufficiently evident without any. I &s;hall only &s;ay a few words to &s;ome noble Lords, who for|&s;ee much inconveniency, from the per&s;ons of their &s;er|vants
<PB N="204" REF="038017_0204_1010D55662745BB8">
being liable to be arre&s;ted. One noble lord ob|&s;erves, That the coachman of a peer may be arre&s;ted, while he is driving his ma&s;ter to the Hou&s;e, and, that con|&s;equently, he will not be able to attend his duty in parli|ament. If this were actually to happen, there are &s;o many methods by which the member might &s;till get to the Hou&s;e, that I can hardly think the noble lord is &s;erious in his ob|jection. Another noble peer &s;aid, That, by this bill, one might lo&s;e his mo&s;t valuable and hone&s;t &s;ervants. This I hold to be a contradiction in terms: for he can neither be a valuable &s;ervant, nor an hone&s;t man, who gets into debt which he is neither able nor willing to pay, till com|pelled by the law. If my &s;ervant, by unfore&s;een acci|dents, has got into debt, and I &s;till wi&s;h to retain him, I certainly would pay the demand. But upon no principle of liberal legi&s;lation whatever, can my &s;ervant have a title to &s;et his creditors at defiance, while, for forty &s;hillings only, the hone&s;t trade&s;man may be torn from his family, and locked up in a gaol. It is mon&s;trous inju&s;tice! I flatter my&s;elf, however, the determination of this day will entirely put an end to all &s;uch partial proceedings for the future, by pa&s;&s;ing into a law the bill now under your Lord&s;hips' con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I come now to &s;peak, upon what, indeed, I would have gladly avoided, had I not been particularly pointed at, for the part I have taken in this bill. It has been &s;aid, by a noble lord on my left hand, that I likewi&s;e am run|ning the race of popularity. If the noble lord means by popularity, that applau&s;e be&s;towed by after-ages on good and virtuous actions, I have long been &s;truggling in that race: to what purpo&s;e, all-trying Time can alone deter|mine. But if the noble lord means that mu&s;hroom po|pularity,
<PB N="205" REF="038017_0205_1010D557EED21D50">
which is rai&s;ed without merit, and lo&s;t without a crime, he is much mi&s;taken in his opinion. I defy the noble Lord to point out a &s;ingle action of my life, in which the popularity of the times ever had the &s;malle&s;t influence on my determinations. I thank God I have a more permanent and &s;teady rule for my con|duct,&mdash;the dictates of my own brea&s;t. They who have foregone that plea&s;ing advi&s;er, and given up their mind to be the &s;lave of every popular impul&s;e, I &s;incerely pity: I pity them &s;till more, if their vanity leads them to mi&s;take the &s;houts of a mob, for the trumpet of Fame. Experience might inform them, that many, who have been &s;aluted with the huzzas of a crowd one day, have receiv|ed their execrations the next; and many, who, by the popularity of their times, have been held up as &s;potle&s;s patriots, have, neverthele&s;s, appeared upon the hi&s;torian's page, when truth has triumphed over delu&s;ion, the a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins of liberty. Why then the noble lord can think I am ambitious of pre&s;ent popularity, that echo of folly, and &s;hadow of renown, I am at a lo&s;s to determine. Be|&s;ides, I do not know that the bill now before your Lord|&s;hips will be popular: it depends much upon the cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice of the day. It may not be popular to compel people to pay their debts; and, in that ca&s;e, the pre&s;ent mu&s;t be a very unpopular bill. It may not be popular neither to take away any of the privileges of parliament; for I very well remember, and many of your Lord&s;hips may remem|ber, that, not long ago, the popular cry was for the exten|&s;ion of privilege; and &s;o far did they carry it at that time, that it was &s;aid, the privilege protected members even in criminal actions; nay, &s;uch was the power of popular prejudices over weak minds, that the very deci&s;ions of
<PB N="206" REF="038017_0206_1010D55B8F52AB20">
&s;ome of the courts were tinctured with that doctrine. It was undoubtedly an abominable doctrine; I thought &s;o then, I think &s;o &s;till; but, neverthele&s;s, it was a popular doctrine, and came immediately from tho&s;e who are call|ed the friends of liberty; how de&s;ervedly, time will &s;how. True liberty, in my opinion, can only exi&s;t when ju&s;tice is equally admini&s;tered to all; to the king and to the beg|gar. Where is the ju&s;tice then, or where is the law that protects a member of parliament more than any other man, from the puni&s;hment due to his crimes? The laws of this country allow of no place, nor any employ|ment, to be a &s;anctuary for crimes; and where I have the honour to &s;it as judge, neither royal favour, nor popular applau&s;e, &s;hall ever protect the guilty.</P>
<P>I have now only to beg pardon for having employed &s;o much of your Lord&s;hips' time; and I am &s;orry a bill, frought with &s;o many good con&s;equences, has not met with an abler advocate: but I doubt not your Lord&s;hips' determination will convince the world, that a bill, calcu|lated to contribute &s;o much to the equal di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice as the pre&s;ent, requires with your Lord&s;hips but very little &s;upport.</P>

He hath decreed, that they only "who &s;eek after wi&s;dom, &s;hall find it; that fools &s;hall be afflict|ed, becau&s;e of their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; and that whoever re|fu&s;eth in&s;truction, &s;hall de&s;troy his own foul." By li&s;ten|ing to the&s;e admonitions, and tempering the vivacity of youth with a proper mixture of &s;erious thought, you may en&s;ure cheerfulne&s;s for the re&s;t of life; but by delivering your&s;elves up at pre&s;ent to giddine&s;s and levity, you lay the foundation of la&s;ting heavine&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>When you look forward to tho&s;e plans of life, which either your circum&s;tances have &s;ugge&s;ted, or your friends have propo&s;ed, you will not he&s;itate to acknowledge, that in order to pur&s;ue them with advantage &s;ome previous di&s;cipline is requi&s;ite. Be a&s;&s;ured, that whatever is to be your profe&s;&s;ion, no education is more nece&s;&s;ary to your &s;ucce&s;s, than the acquirement of virtuous di&s;po&s;itions and habits. This is the univer&s;al preparation for every cha|racter, and every &s;tation in life. Bad as the world is, re|&s;pect is always paid to virtue. In the u&s;ual cour&s;e of human affairs, it will be found, that a plain under&s;tanding, joined with acknowledged worth, contributes more to pro&s;perity, than the brighte&s;t parts without probity or honour. Whether &s;cience or bu&s;ine&s;s, or public life, be your aim, virtue &s;till enters, for a principal &s;hare, into all the&s;e great departments of &s;ociety. It is connected with eminence, in every liberal art; with reputation, in every

branch of fair and u&s;eful bu&s;ine&s;s; with di&s;tinction, in every public &s;tation. The vigour which it gives the mind, and the weight which it adds to character; the generous &s;entiments which it breathes; the undaunted &s;pirit which it in&s;pires; the ardour of diligence which it quickens; the freedom which it procures from pernicious and di&s;|honourable avocations; are the foundations of all that is highly honourable, or greatly &s;ucce&s;sful among men.</P>
<P>Whatever ornamental or engaging endowments you now po&s;&s;e&s;s, virtue is a nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ite, in order to their &s;hining with proper lu&s;tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Feeble are the attrac|tions of the faire&s;t form, if it be &s;u&s;pected that nothing within corre&s;ponds to the plea&s;ing appearance without. Short are the triumphs of wit, when it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the vehicle of malice. By whatever means you may at fir&s;t attract the attention, you can hold the e&s;teem, and &s;ecure the hearts of others, only by amiable di&s;po&s;itions, and the accompli&s;hments of the mind. The&s;e are the qualities who&s;e influence will la&s;t, when the lu&s;tre of all that once &s;parkled and dazzled has pa&s;&s;ed away.</P>
<P>Let not then the &s;ea&s;on of youth be barren of improve|ments, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> future felicity and honour. Now is the &s;eed-time of life; and according to "what you &s;ow, you &s;hall reap." Your character is now, under Divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, of your own forming; your fate is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, put into your own hands. Your nature is as yet pliant and &s;oft. Habits have not e&s;tabli&s;hed their dominion. Prejudices have not pre-occupied your un|der&s;tanding. The world has not had time to contract and deba&s;e your affections. All your powers are more vigo|rous, di&s;embarra&s;&s;ed, and free, than they will be at any

It will form the channel in which your life is to run; nay, it may determine is everla&s;ting i&s;&s;ue. Con&s;ider then the employment of this important period, as the highe&s;t tru&s;t which &s;hall ever be committed to you; as in a great mea&s;ure, deci&s;ive of your happine&s;s, in time, and in eter|nity. As in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the &s;ea&s;ons, each, by the invariable laws of Nature, affects the productions of what is next in cour&s;e; &s;o, in human life, every period of our age, according as it is well or ill &s;pent, influences the happine&s;s of that which is to follow. Virtuous youth gradually brings forward accompli&s;hed and flouri&s;hing manhood; and &s;uch manhood pa&s;&s;es of it&s;elf, without un|ea&s;ine&s;s, into re&s;pectable and tranquil old age. But when nature is turned out of its regular cour&s;e, di&s;order takes place in the moral, ju&s;t as in the vegetable world. If the Spring put forth no blo&s;&s;oms, in Summer there will be no beauty, and in Autumn, no fruit. So, if youth be trifled away without improvement, manhood will proba|bly be contemptible, and old age mi&s;erable. If the be|ginnings of life have been "vanity," its latter end can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">carcely be any other than "vexation of &s;pirit."</P>
<P>I &s;hall fini&s;h this addre&s;s, with calling your attention to that dependence on the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, which, amid&s;t all your endeavours after improvement, you ought continually to pre&s;erve. It is too common with the young, even when they re&s;olve to tread the path of virtue and honour, to &s;et out with pre&s;umptuous confidence in them&s;elves. Tru&s;ting to their own abi|lities for carrying them &s;ucce&s;sfully through life, they
<PB N="211" REF="038017_0211_1010D56AB353DCB0">
are carele&s;s of applying to God, or of deriving any a&s;&s;i&s;|tance from what they are apt to reckon the gloomy di&s;|cipline of religion. Alas! how little do they know the dangers which await them? Neither human wi&s;dom, nor human virtue, un&s;upported by religion, is equal to the trying &s;ituations which often occur in life. By the &s;hock of temptation, how frequently have the mo&s;t vir|tuous intentions been overthrown? Under the pre&s;&s;ure of di&s;a&s;ter, how often has the greate&s;t con&s;tancy &s;unk? "every good, and every perfect gift, is from above." Wi&s;dom and virtue, as well as "riches and honour, come from God." De&s;titute of his favour, you are in no bet|ter &s;ituation, with all your boa&s;ted abilities, than orphans left to wander in a trackle&s;s de&s;ert, without any guide to conduct them, or any &s;helter to cover them from the ga|thering &s;torm. Correct, then, this ill-founded arrogance. Expect not, that your happine&s;s can be independent of him who made youth. By faith and repentance, apply to the Redeemer of the world. By piety and prayer, &s;eek the protection of the God of heaven. I conclude with the &s;olemn words, in which a great prince delivered his dying charge to his &s;on; words, which every young per|&s;on ought to con&s;ider as addre&s;&s;ed to him&s;elf, and to en|grave deeply on his heart: "Solomon, my &s;on, know thou the God of thy fathers; and &s;erve him with a per|fect heart, and with a willing mind. For the Lord &s;earches all hearts, and under&s;tandeth all the imagina|tions of the thoughts. If thou &s;eek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou for&s;ake him, he will ca&s;t thee off for ever."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. Earthquake at Calabria, in the year <HI>1638.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AN account of this dreadful earthquake, is given by the celebrated Father Kircher. It happened whil&s;t he was on his journey to vi&s;it Mount Aetna, and the re&s;t of the wonders that lie towards the &s;outh of Italy. Kircher is con&s;idered, by &s;cholars, as one of the greate&s;t prodigies of learning.</P>
<P>"Having hired a boat, in company with four more, (two friars of the order of St. Francis, and two &s;eculars,) we launched, from the harbour of Me&s;&s;ina, in Sicily; and arrived, the &s;ame day, at the promontory of Pelorus. Our de&s;tination was for the city of Euphaemia, in Cala|bria; where we had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act; and where we de&s;igned to tarry for &s;ome time. However, Provi|dence &s;eemed willing to cro&s;s our de&s;ign; for we were obliged to continue three days at Pelorus, on account of the weather; and though we often put out to &s;ea, yet we were as often driven back. At length, wearied with the delay, we re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute our voyage; and, al|though the &s;ea &s;eemed more than u&s;ually agitated, we ventured forward. The gulph of Charybdis, which we approached, &s;eemed whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">led round in &s;uch a manner, as
<PB N="213" REF="038017_0213_1010D5761B3B4C58">
to form a va&s;t hollow, verging to a point in the centre. Procceding onward, and turning my eyes to Aetna, I &s;aw it ca&s;t forth large volumes of &s;moke, of mountainous &s;izes, which entirely covered the i&s;land, and blotted out the very &s;hores from my view. This, together with the dreadful noi&s;e, and the fulphurous &s;tench which was &s;trongly perceived, filled me with apprehen&s;ions, that &s;ome more dreadful calamity was impending. The &s;ea it&s;elf &s;eemed to wear a very unu&s;ual appearance: they who have &s;een a lake in a violent &s;hower of rain, covered all over with bubbles, will conceive &s;ome idea of its agitations. My &s;urpri&s;e was &s;till increa&s;ed, by the calm|ne&s;s and &s;erenity of the weather; not a breeze, not a cloud, which might be &s;uppo&s;ed to put all nature thus into motion. I therefore warned my companions, that an earthquake was approaching; and, after &s;ome time, making for the &s;hore with all po&s;&s;ible diligence, we landed at Tropaea, happy and thankful for having e&s;caped the threatening dangers of the &s;ea."</P>
<P>"But our triumphs at land were of &s;hort duration; for we had &s;carcely arrived at the Je&s;uits' College, in that City, when our ears were &s;tunned with a horrid &s;ound, re&s;embling that of an infinite number of chariots, driven fiercely forward; the wheels rattling, and the thongs cracking. Soon after this, a mo&s;t dreadful earthquake en&s;ued; &s;o that the whole tract upon which we &s;tood, &s;eemed to vibrate, as if we were in the &s;cale of a balance, that continued wavering. This motion, however, &s;oon grew more violent; and being no longer able to keep my legs, I was thrown pro&s;trate upon the ground. In the mean time, the univer&s;al ruin round me redoubled
<PB N="214" REF="038017_0214_1010D57491C7AE78">
my amazment. The cra&s;h of falling hou&s;es, the tot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ering of towers, and the groans of the dying, all contributed to rai&s;e my terror and de&s;pair. On every &s;ide of me, I &s;aw nothing but a &s;cene of ruin; and danger threatening wherever I &s;hould fly. I commend my&s;elf to God, as my la&s;t great refuge. At that hour, O how vain was every &s;ublunary happine&s;s! Wealth, honour, empire, wi&s;dom, all mere u&s;ele&s;s &s;ounds, and as empty as the bubbles in the deep! Ju&s;t &s;tanding on the thre&s;hold of eternity, nothing but God was my plea&s;ure; and the nearer I approached, I only loved him the more. After &s;ome time, however, finding that I remained unhurt, amid&s;t the general concu&s;&s;ion, I re&s;olved to venture for &s;afety; and running as fa&s;t as I could, I reached the &s;hore, but almo&s;t terrified out of my rea&s;on. I did not &s;earch long here, till I found the boat in which I had landed; and my companions al&s;o, who&s;e terrors were even greater than mine. Our meeting was not of that kind, where every one is de&s;irous of telling his own happy e&s;cape: it was all &s;ilence, and a gloomy dread of impending terrors."</P>
<P>"Leaving this &s;eat of de&s;olation, we pro&s;ecuted our voyage along the coa&s;t; and the next day came to Ro|chetta, where we landed, although the earth &s;till conti|nued in violent agitations. But we had &s;carcely arrived at our inn, when we were once more obliged to return to the boat; and, in about half an hour, we &s;aw the great|er part of the town, and the inn at which we had &s;et up, da&s;hed to the ground, and burying the inhabitants be|neath the ruins."</P>
<P>"In this manner, proceeding onward in our little ve&s;|&s;el, finding no &s;afety at land, and yet, from the &s;mallne&s;s
<PB N="215" REF="038017_0215_1010D577AE362F58">
of our boat, having but a very dangerous continuance at &s;ea, we at length landed at Lopizium, a ca&s;tle midway between Tropaea and Euphaemia, the city to which, as I &s;aid before, we were bound. Here, wherever I turned my eyes, nothing but &s;cenes of ruin and horror appeared; towns and ca&s;tles levelled to the ground; Strombalo, though at &s;ixty miles di&s;tance, belching forth flames in an unu&s;ual manner, and with a noi&s;e which I could di&s;|tinctly hear. But my attention was quickly turned from more remote, to contiguous danger. The rumbling &s;ound of an approaching earthquake, which we by this time were grown acquainted with, alarmed us for the con&s;equences; it every moment &s;eemed to grow louder, and to approach nearer. The place on which we &s;tood now began to &s;hake mo&s;t dreadfully; &s;o that being un|able to &s;tand, my companions and I caught hold of what|ever &s;hrub grew next to us, and &s;upported our&s;elves in that manner."</P>
<P>"After &s;ome time, this violent paroxy&s;m cea&s;ing, we again &s;tood up, in order to pro&s;ecute our voyage to Eu|phaemia, which lay within &s;ight. In the mean time, while we were preparing for this purpo&s;e, I turned my eyes towards the city, but could &s;ee only a frightful dark cloud, that &s;eemed to re&s;t upon the place. This the more &s;ur|pri&s;ed us, as the weather was &s;o very &s;erene. We waited, therefore, till the cloud had pa&s;&s;ed away: then turning to look for the city, it was totally &s;unk. Wonderful to tell! nothing but a di&s;mal and putrid lake was &s;een where it &s;tood. We looked about to find &s;ome one that could tell us of its &s;ad cata&s;trophe, but could &s;ee no per&s;on. All was become a melancholy &s;olitude; a &s;cene of hideous de&s;olation. Thus proceeding pen&s;ively along, in que&s;t

of &s;ome human being that could give us a little informa|tion, we at length &s;aw a boy &s;itting by the &s;hore, and ap|pearing &s;tupified with terror. Of him, therefore, we enquired concerning the fate of the city; but he could not be prevailed on to give us an an&s;wer. We entreated him, with every expre&s;&s;ion of tenderne&s;s and pity, to tell us; but his &s;en&s;es were quite wrapt up in the con|templation of the danger he had e&s;caped. We offered him &s;ome victuals, but he &s;eemed to loath the &s;ight. We &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in our offices of kindne&s;s; but he only pointed to the place of the city, like one out of his &s;en&s;es; and then running up into the woods, was never heard of after. Such was the fate of the city of Euphaemia: and as we continued our melancholy cour&s;e along the &s;hore, the whole coa&s;t, for the &s;pace of two hundred miles, pre|&s;ented nothing but the remains of cities; and men &s;cat|tered, without a habitation, over the fields. Proceeding thus along, we at length ended our di&s;tre&s;sful voyage, by arriving at Naples, after having e&s;caped a thou&s;and dan|gers both at &s;ea and land."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. On Di&s;cretion.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE often thought, if the minds of men were laid open, we &s;hould &s;ee but little difference between that of the wi&s;e man, and that of the fool.</P>
<P>There are infinite reveries, numberle&s;s extravagances, and a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vanities, which pa&s;s through both. The great difference is, that the fir&s;t knows how to pick and cull his thoughts for conver&s;ation, by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="220" REF="038017_0220_1010D58933CD3330">
&s;ome, and communicating others; whereas the other lets them all indifferently fly out in words. This &s;ort of di&s;|cretion, however, has no place in private conver&s;ation between intimate friends. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, the wi&s;e&s;t men very often talk like the weake&s;t; for indeed talking with a friend is nothing el&s;e than <HI>thinking aloud.</HI></P>
<P>Tully has therefore very ju&s;tly expo&s;ed a precept, de|livered by &s;ome ancient writers, That a man &s;hould live with his enemy in &s;uch a manner, as might leave him room to become his friend; and with his friend, in &s;uch a man|ner, that, if he became his enemy, it &s;hould not be in his power to hurt him. The fir&s;t part of this rule, which regards our behaviour towards an enemy, is indeed very rea&s;onable, as well as very prudential; but the latter part of it, which regards our behaviour towards a friend, favours more of cunning than of di&s;cretion; and would cut a man off from the greate&s;t plea&s;ures of life, which are the freedoms of conver&s;ation with a bo&s;om friend. Be&s;ides that, when a friend is turned into an enemy, the world is ju&s;t enough to accu&s;e the perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of the friend, rather than the indi&s;cretion of the per&s;on who con|fided in him.</P>
<P>Di&s;cretion does not only &s;how it&s;elf in words, but in all the circum&s;tances of action; and is like an under-agent of Providence, to guide and direct us in the ordinary con|cerns of life.</P>
<P>There are many more &s;hining qualities in the mind of man, but there is none &s;o u&s;eful as di&s;cretion. It is this, indeed, which gives a value to all the re&s;t; which &s;ets them at work in their proper times and places; and turns them to the advantage of the per&s;on who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
<PB N="221" REF="038017_0221_1010D58C32DDE190">
them. Without it, learning is pedantry, and wit imper|inence; virtue it&s;elf looks like weakne&s;s; the be&s;t parts only qualify a man to be more &s;prightly in errors, and active to his own prejudice.</P>
<P>Di&s;cretion does not only make a man the ma&s;ter of his own parts, but of other men's. The di&s;creet man finds out the talents of tho&s;e he conver&s;es with; and knows how to apply them to proper u&s;es. Accordingly, if we look into particular communities and divi&s;ions of men, we may ob&s;erve, that it is the di&s;creet man, not the witty, nor the learned, nor the brave, who guides the conver&s;ation, and gives mea&s;ures to the &s;ociety. A man with great talents, but void of di&s;cretion, is like Polyphemus in the fable, &s;trong and blind; endued with an irre&s;i&s;tible force, which, for want of &s;ight, is of no u&s;e to him.</P>
<P>Though a man have all other perfections, and want di&s;cretion, he will be of no great con&s;equence in the world; but if he have this &s;ingle talent in perfection, and but a common &s;hare of others, he may do what he plea&s;es in his particular &s;tation of life.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that I think di&s;cretion the mo&s;t u&s;eful talent a man can be ma&s;ter of, I look upon cunning to be the accompli&s;hment of little, mean, ungenerous minds. Di&s;cretion points out the noble&s;t ends to us; and pur&s;ues the mo&s;t proper and laudable methods of attaining them: cunning has only private &s;elfi&s;h aims; and &s;ticks at no|thing which may make them &s;ucceed. Di&s;cretion has large and extended views; and, like a well formed eye, commands a whole horizon: cunning is a kind of &s;hort-&s;ightedne&s;s, that di&s;covers the minute&s;t objects which are near at hand, but is not able to di&s;cern things at a di&s;tance.
<PB N="222" REF="038017_0222_1010C727D97E3308">
Di&s;cretion, the more it is di&s;covered, gives a greater au|thority to the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it: cunning, when it is once detected, lo&s;es its force, and makes a man inca|pable of bringing about even tho&s;e events which he might have done, had he pa&s;&s;ed only for a plain man. Di&s;cre|tion is the perfection of rea&s;on; and a guide to us in all the duties of life: cunning is a kind of in&s;tinct, that only looks out after our immediate intere&s;t and welfare. Di&s;|cretion is only found in men of &s;trong &s;en&s;e and good un|der&s;tandings: cunning is often to be met with in brutes them&s;elves; and in per&s;ons who are but the fewe&s;t re|moves from them. In &s;hort, cunning is only the mimic of di&s;cretion; and it may pa&s;s upon weak men, in the &s;ame manner as vivacity is often mi&s;taken for wit, and gravity for wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>The ca&s;t of mind which is natural to a di&s;creet man, makes him look forward into futurity, and con&s;ider what will be his condition millions of ages hence, as well as what it is at pre&s;ent. He knows that the mi&s;ery or hap|pine&s;s which is re&s;erved for him in another world, lo&s;es nothing of its reality by being placed at &s;o great a di&s;|tance from him. The objects do not appear little to him becau&s;e they are remote. He con&s;iders, that tho&s;e plea|&s;ures and pains which lie hid in eternity, approach nearer to him every moment; and will be pre&s;ent with him in their full weight and mea&s;ure, as much as tho&s;e pains and plea&s;ures which he feels at this very in&s;tant. For this rea&s;on, he is careful to &s;ecure to him&s;elf that which is the proper happine&s;s of his nature, and the ultimate de&s;ign of his being. He carries his thoughts to the end of every

action; and con&s;iders the mo&s;t di&s;tant, as well as the mo&s;t immediate effects of it. He &s;uper&s;edes every little pro&s;pect of gain and advantage which offers it&s;elf here, if he does not find it con&s;i&s;tent with his views of an here|after. In a word, his hopes are full of immortality; his &s;chemes are large and glorious; and his conduct &s;uitable to one who knows his true intere&s;t, and how to pur&s;ue it by proper methods.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. On the government of our Thoughts.</HEAD>
<P>A MULTITUDE of ca&s;es occur, in which we are no le&s;s accountable for what we think, than for what we do.</P>
<P>As, fir&s;t, when the introduction of any train of thought depends upon our&s;elves, and is our voluntary act; by turning our attention towards &s;uch objects, awakening &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions, or engaging in &s;uch employments, as we know mu&s;t give a peculiar determination to our thoughts. Next, when thoughts, by whatever accident they may have been originally &s;ugge&s;ted, are indulged with delibera|tion and complacency. Though the mind has been pa&s;|&s;ive in their reception, and, therefore, free from blame; yet, if it be active in their continuance, the guilt becomes its own. They may have intruded at fir&s;t, like unbidden gue&s;ts; but if when entered, they are made welcome, and kindly entertained, the ca&s;e is the &s;ame as if they had been invited from the beginning. If we be thus accountable to God for thoughts either voluntarily introduced, or de|liberately indulged, we are no le&s;s &s;o, in the la&s;t place,
<PB N="224" REF="038017_0224_1010D59716AFF008">
for tho&s;e which find admittance into our hearts from &s;u|pine negligence, from total relaxation of attention, from allowing our imagination to rove with entire licence, "like the eyes of the fool, towards the ends of the earth." Our minds are, in this ca&s;e, thrown open to folly and va|nity. They are pro&s;tituted to every evil thing which plea&s;es to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The con&s;equences mu&s;t all be charged to our account; and in vain we plead excu&s;e from human infirmity. Hence it appears, that the great object at which we are to aim in governing our thoughts, is, to take the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures for preventing the introduction of &s;uch as are &s;inful, and for ha&s;tening their expul&s;ion, if they &s;hall have introduced them&s;elves with|out con&s;ent of the will.</P>
<P>But when we de&s;cend into our brea&s;ts, and examine how far we have &s;tudied to keep this object in view, who can tell, "how oft he hath offended?" In no article of religion or morals are men more culpably remi&s;s, than in the unre&s;trained indulgence they give to fancy; and that too, for the mo&s;t part, without remor&s;e. Since the time that Rea&s;on began to exert her powers, Thought, during our waking hours, has been active in every brea&s;t, without a moments &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or pau&s;e. The current of ideas has been always flowing. The wheels of the &s;piritual engine have circulated with perpetual motion. Let me a&s;k, what has been the fruit of this ince&s;&s;ant ac|tivity with the greater part of mankind? Of the innu|merable hours that have been employed in thought, how few are marked with any permanent or u&s;eful effect? How many have either pa&s;&s;ed away in idle dreams: or have been abandoned to anxious di&s;contented mu&s;ings, to un&s;ocial and malignant pa&s;&s;ions, or to irregular and crimi|nal

de&s;ires? Had I power to lay open that &s;torehou&s;e of iniquity which the hearts of too many conceal; could I draw out and read to them a li&s;t of all the imaginations they have devi&s;ed, and all the pa&s;&s;ions they have indulged in &s;ecret; what a picture of men &s;hould I pre&s;ent to them|&s;elves! What crimes would they appear to have perpe|trated in &s;ecrecy, which to their mo&s;t intimate companions they dur&s;t not reveal!</P>
<P>Even when men imagine their thoughts to be inno|cently employed they too commonly &s;uffer them to run out into extravagant imaginations, and chimerical plans of what they would wi&s;h to attain, or choo&s;e to be, if they could frame the cour&s;e of things according to their de&s;ire. Though &s;uch employments of fancy come not under the &s;ame de&s;cription with tho&s;e which are plainly criminal, yet wholly unblamable they &s;eldom are. Be|&s;ides the wa&s;te of time which they occa&s;ion, and the mi&s;|application which they indicate of tho&s;e intellectual pow|ers that were given to us for much nobler purpo&s;es, &s;uch romantic &s;peculations lead us always into the neighbour|hood of forbidden regions. They place us on dangerous ground. They are for the mo&s;t part connected with &s;ome one bad pa&s;&s;ion; and they always nouri&s;h a giddy and frivolous turn of thought. They unfit the mind for ap|plying with vigour to rational pur&s;uits, or for acquie&s;cing in &s;ober plans of conduct. From that ideal world in which it allows it&s;elf to dwell, it returns to the commerce of men, unbent and relaxed, &s;ickly and tainted, aver&s;e from di&s;charging the duties, and &s;ometimes di&s;qualified even for reli&s;hing the plea&s;ures, of ordinary life.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VI. On the Evils which flow from unre&s;trained Pa&s;&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN man revolted from his Maker, his pa&s;&s;ions re|belled again&s;t him&s;elf; and, from being originally the mini&s;ters of rea&s;on, have become the tyrants of the &s;oul. Hence, in treating of this &s;ubject, two things may be a&s;&s;umed as principles: fir&s;t, that through the pre&s;ent weak|ne&s;s of the under&s;tanding, our pa&s;&s;ions are often directed towards improper objects; and next, that even when their direction is ju&s;t, and their objects are innocent, they perpetually tend to run into exce&s;s; they always hurry us towards their gratification, with a blind and dangerous impetuo&s;ity. On the&s;e two points then turns the whole government of our pa&s;&s;ions: fir&s;t, to a&s;certain the proper objects of their pur&s;uit; and next, to re&s;train them in that pur&s;uit, when they would carry us beyond the bounds of rea&s;on. If there be any pa&s;&s;ion which intrudes it&s;elf un&s;ea&s;onably into our mind, which darkens and troubles our judgment, or habitually di&s;compo&s;es our temper; which unfits us for properly di&s;charging the duties, or di&s;qualifies us for cheerfully enjoying the comforts of life, we may certainly conclude it to have gained a dangerous a&s;cendant. The great object which we ought to propo&s;e to our&s;elves is, to acquire a firm and &s;tedfa&s;t mind, which the infatuation of pa&s;&s;ion &s;hall not &s;educe, nor its violence &s;hake; which, re&s;ting on fixed principles, &s;hall, in the mid&s;t of contending emotions, remain free, and ma&s;ter

of it&s;elf; able to li&s;ten calmly to the voice of con&s;cience, and prepared to obey its dictates without he&s;itation.</P>
<P>To obtain, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;uch command of pa&s;&s;ion, is one of the highe&s;t attainments of the rational nature. Argu|ments to &s;how its importance crowd upon us from every quarter. If there be any fertile &s;ource of mi&s;chief to hu|man life, it is, beyond doubt, the mi&s;rule of pa&s;&s;ion. It is this which poi&s;ons the enjoyment of individuals, over|turns the order of &s;ociety, and &s;trews the path of life with &s;o many mi&s;eries, as to render it indeed the vale of tears. All tho&s;e great &s;cenes of public calamity, which we be|hold with a&s;toni&s;hment and horror, have originated from the &s;ource of violent pa&s;&s;ions. The&s;e have over&s;pread the earth with blood&s;hed. The&s;e have pointed the a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;in's dagger, and filled the poi&s;oned bowl. The&s;e, in every age, have furni&s;hed too copious materials for the orator's pathetic declamation, and for the poet's tragical &s;ong.</P>
<P>When from public life we de&s;cend to private conduct, though pa&s;&s;ion operates not there in &s;uch a wide and de|&s;tructive &s;phere, we &s;hall find its influence to be no le&s;s baneful. I need not mention the black and fierce pa&s;|&s;ions, &s;uch as envy, jealou&s;y, and revenge, who&s;e effects are obviou&s;ly noxious, and who&s;e agitations are immediate mi&s;ery. But take any of the licentious and &s;en&s;ual kind. Suppo&s;e it to have unlimitted &s;cope; trace it throughout its cour&s;e: and we &s;hall find that gradually, as it ri&s;es, it taints the &s;oundne&s;s, and troubles the peace of his mind over whom it reigns; that, in its progre&s;s, it engages him in pur&s;uits which are marked either with danger or with &s;hame; that, in the end, it wa&s;tes his fortune, de&s;troys his health, or deba&s;es his character; and aggravates all

<HEAD>SECTION VII. On the proper State of our Temper, with re&s;pect to one another.</HEAD>
<P>IT is evident, in the general, that if we con&s;ult either public welfare or private happine&s;s, Chri&s;tian charity ought to regulate our di&s;po&s;ition in mutual intercour&s;e. But as this great principle admits of &s;everal diver&s;ified appearances, let us con&s;ider &s;ome of the chief forms un|der which it ought to &s;how it&s;elf in the u&s;ual tenour of life.</P>
<P>What, fir&s;t, pre&s;ents it&s;elf to be recommended, is a peaceable temper; a di&s;po&s;ition aver&s;e to give offence, and de&s;irous of cultivating harmony, and amicable inter|cour&s;e in &s;ociety. This &s;uppo&s;es yielding and conde&s;cend|ing manners, unwillingne&s;s to contend with others about trifles, and, in conte&s;ts that are unavoidable, proper mode|ration of &s;pirit. Such a temper is the fir&s;t principle of &s;elf-enjoyment. It is the ba&s;is of all order and happine&s;s among mankind. The po&s;itive and contentious, the rude and quarrel&s;ome, are the bane of &s;ociety. They &s;eem de&s;tined to bla&s;t the &s;mall &s;hare of comfort which nature has here allotted to man. But they cannot di&s;turb the peace of others, more than they break their own. The hurricane rages fir&s;t in their own bo&s;om, before it is let
<PB N="229" REF="038017_0229_1010D5A6F5078FC0">
forth upon the world. In the tempe&s;ts which they rai&s;e, they are always to&s;t; and frequently it is their lot to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>A peaceable temper mu&s;t be &s;upported by a candid one, or a di&s;po&s;ition to view the conduct of others with fairne&s;s and impartiality. This &s;tands oppo&s;ed to a jea|lous and &s;u&s;picious temper, which a&s;cribes every action to the wor&s;t motive, and throws a black &s;hade over every character. If we would be happy in our&s;elves, or in our connexions with others, let us guard again&s;t this malig|nant &s;pirit. Let us &s;tudy that charity "which thinketh no evil;" that temper which, without degenerating into credulity, will di&s;po&s;e us to be ju&s;t; and which can allow us to ob&s;erve an error, without imputing it as a crime. Thus we &s;hall be kept free from that continual irritation, which imaginary injuries rai&s;e in a &s;u&s;picious brea&s;t; and &s;hall walk among men as our brethren, not as our enemies.</P>
<P>But to be peaceable, and to be candid, is not all that is required of a good man. He mu&s;t cultivate a kind, gene|rous, and &s;ympathizing temper, which feels for di&s;tre&s;s, wherever it is beheld; which enters into the concerns of his friends with ardour; and to all with whom he has in|tercour&s;e, is gentle, obliging, and humane. How amiable appears &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, when contra&s;ted with a ma|licious or envious temper, which wraps it&s;elf up in its own narrow intere&s;t, looks with an evil eye on the &s;uc|ce&s;s of others, and with an unnatural &s;atisfaction, feeds on their di&s;appointments or mi&s;eries! How little does he know of the true happine&s;s of life, who is a &s;tranger to that intercour&s;e of good offices and kind affections, which, by a plea&s;ing charm, attaches men to one another, and circulates joy from heart to heart!</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="038017_0230_1010C72E461F1BB0">We are not to imagine, that a benevolent temper finds no exerci&s;e, unle&s;s when opportunities offer of perform|ing actions of high genero&s;ity, or of exten&s;ive utility. The&s;e may &s;eldom occur. The condition of the greater part of mankind, in a good mea&s;ure, precludes them. But, in the ordinary round of human affairs, many occa|&s;ions daily pre&s;ent them&s;elves of mitigating the vexations which others &s;uffer: of &s;oothing their minds; of aid|ing their intere&s;t; of promoting their cheerfulne&s;s, or ea&s;e. Such occa&s;ions may relate to the &s;maller incidents of life. But let us remember, that of &s;mall incidents the &s;y&s;tem of human life is chiefly compo&s;ed. The at|tentions which re&s;pect the&s;e, when &s;ugge&s;ted by real benignity of temper, are often more material to the hap|pine&s;s of tho&s;e around us, than actions which carry the appearance of greater dignity and &s;plendour. No wi&s;e or good man ought to account any rules of behaviour as below his regard, which tend to cement the great brother|hood of mankind in comfortable union.</P>
<P>Particularly amid&s;t that familiar intercour&s;e which be|longs to dome&s;tic life, all the virtues of temper find an ample range. It is very unfortunate, that within that circle, men too often think them&s;elves at liberty, to give unre&s;trained vent to the caprice of pa&s;&s;ion and humour. Whereas there, on the contrary, more than any where, it concerns them to attend to the government of their heart; to check what is violent in their tem|pers, and to &s;often what is har&s;h in their manners. For there the temper is formed. There, the real character di&s;plays it&s;elf. The forms of the world di&s;gui&s;e men when abroad. But within his own family, every man is known to be what he truly is.&mdash;In all our intercour&s;e

then with others, particularly in that which is clo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t intimate, let us cultivate a peaceable, a candid, a gentle and friendly temper. This is the temper to which, by repeated injunctions, our holy religion &s;eeks to form us. This was the temper of Chri&s;t. This is the temper of Heaven.</P>

<P>Terre&s;trial happine&s;s is of &s;hort continuance. The brightne&s;s of the flame is wa&s;ting its fuel; the fragrant flower is pa&s;&s;ing away in its own odours. The vigour of Omar began to fail; the curls of beauty fell from his head; &s;trength departed from his hands; and agility from his feet. He gave back to the calif the keys of tru&s;t, and the &s;eals of &s;ecrecy; and &s;ought no other plea&s;ure for the remains of life, than the conver&s;e of the wi&s;e, and the gratitude of the good&middot;</P>
<P>The powers of his mind were yet unimpaired. His chamber was filled by vi&s;itants, eager to catch the dic|tates of experience, and officious to pay the tribute of admiration. Caled, the &s;on of the viceroy of Egypt, en|tered every day early, and retired late. He was beautiful and eloquent: Omar admired his wit, and loved his do|cility. "Tell me," &s;aid Caled, "thou to who&s;e voice nations have li&s;tened, and who&s;e wi&s;dom is known to the extremities of A&s;ia, tell me how I may re&s;emble Omar the prudent. The arts by which thou ha&s;t gained power

and pre&s;erved it, are to thee no longer nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful: impart to me the &s;ecret of thy conduct, and teach me the plan upon which thy wi&s;dom has built thy fortune."</P>
<P>"Young man," &s;aid Omar, "it is of little u&s;e to form plans of life. When I took my fir&s;t &s;urvey of the world, in my twentieth year, having con&s;idered the various con|ditions of mankind, in the hour of &s;olitude I &s;aid thus to my&s;elf, leaning again&s;t a cedar, which &s;pread its branches over my head: 'Seventy years are allowed to man: I have yet fifty remaining. Ten years I will allot to the at|tainment of knowledge, and ten I will pa&s;s in foreign countries; I &s;hall be learned, and therefore &s;hall be ho|noured; every city will &s;hout at my arrival, and every &s;tudent will &s;olicit my friend&s;hip. Twenty years thus pa&s;&s;ed, will &s;tore my mind with images, which I &s;hall be bu&s;y, through the re&s;t of my life, in combining and com|paring. I &s;hall revel in inexhau&s;table accumulations of intellectual riches; I &s;hall find new plea&s;ures for every moment; and &s;hall never more be weary of my&s;elf. I will not, however, deviate too far from the beaten track of life; but will try what can be found in female delicacy. I will marry a wife beautiful as the Houries, and wi&s;e as Zobeide: with her I will live twenty years within the &s;uburbs of Bagdat, in every plea&s;ure that wealth can pur|cha&s;e, and fancy can invent. I will then retire to a rural dwelling; pa&s;s my days in ob&s;curity and contemplation; and lie &s;ilently down on the bed of death. Throgh my life it &s;hall be my &s;ettled re&s;olution, that I will never de|pend upon the &s;mile of princes; that I will never &s;tand expo&s;ed to the artifices of courts; I will never pant for public honours, nor di&s;turb my quiet with the affairs of
<PB N="236" REF="038017_0236_1010D5B849DD2D50">
&s;tate.' Such was my &s;cheme of life, which I impre&s;&s;ed in|delibly upon my memory."</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t part of my en&s;uing time was to be &s;pent in &s;earch of knowledge, and I know not how I was diverted from my de&s;ign. I had no vi&s;ible impediments without, nor any ungovernable pa&s;&s;ions within. I regarded know|ledge as the highe&s;t honour, and the mo&s;t engaging plea|&s;ure; yet day &s;tole upon day, and month gilded after month, till I found that &s;even years of the fir&s;t ten had vani&s;hed, and left nothing behind them. I now po&s;tponed my pur|po&s;e of travelling; for why &s;hould I go abroad, while &s;o much remain to be learned at home? I immured my&s;elf for four years, and &s;tudied the laws of the empire. The fame of my &s;kill reached the judges: I was found able to &s;peak upon doubtful que&s;tions; and was commanded to &s;tand at the foot&s;tool of the calif. I was heard with atten|tion; I was con&s;ulted with confidence; and the love of prai&s;e fa&s;tened on my heart."</P>
<P>"I &s;till wi&s;hed to &s;ee di&s;tant countries; li&s;tened with rapture to the relations of travellers; and re&s;olved &s;ome time to a&s;k my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, that I might fea&s;t my &s;oul with novelty: but my pre&s;ence was always nece&s;&s;ary; and the &s;tream of bu&s;ine&s;s hurried me along. Sometimes I was afraid le&s;t I &s;hould be charged with ingratitude; but I &s;till propo&s;ed to travel, and therefore would not confine my|&s;elf by marriage."</P>
<P>"In my fiftieth year, I began to &s;u&s;pect that the time of travelling was pa&s;t; and thought it be&s;t to lay hold on the felicity yet in my power, and indulge my&s;elf in do|me&s;tic plea&s;ures. But at fifty no man ea&s;ily finds a wo|man beautiful as the Houries, and wi&s;e as Zobeide. I
<PB N="237" REF="038017_0237_1010D5BC66E9D290">
inquired and rejected, con&s;ulted and deliberated, till the &s;ixty-&s;econd year made me a&s;hamed of wi&s;hing to marry. I had now nothing left but retirement; and for retire|ment I never found a time, till di&s;ea&s;e forced me from public employment."</P>
<P>"Such was my &s;cheme, and &s;uch has been its con&s;e|quence. With an in&s;atiable thir&s;t for knowledge, I trifled away the years of improvement; with a re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire of &s;eeing different countries, I have always re&s;ided in the &s;ame city; with the highe&s;t expectation of connubial fe|licity, I have lived unmarried; and with unalterable re&s;o|lutions of contemplative retirement, I am going to die within the walls of Bagdat."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XI. The Plea&s;ures of virtuous Sen&s;ibility.</HEAD>
<P>THE good effects of true &s;en&s;ibility on general virtue and happine&s;s, admit of no di&s;pute. Let us con&s;ider its effect on the happine&s;s of him who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, and the various plea&s;ures to which it gives him acce&s;s. If he is ma&s;ter of riches or influence, it affords him the means of increa&s;ing his own enjoyment, by relieving the wants, or increa&s;ing the comforts of others. If he command not the&s;e advantages, yet all the comforts, which he &s;ees in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the de&s;erving, become in &s;ome &s;ort his, by his rejoicing in the good which they enjoy. Even the face of nature yields a &s;atisfaction to him, which the in&s;en&s;ible can never know. The profu&s;ion of goodne&s;s which he beholds poured forth on the univer&s;e, dilates his heart with the thought, that innumerable multitudes around
<PB N="238" REF="038017_0238_1010D5BDEDBA8B00">
him are ble&s;t and happy. When he &s;ees the labours of men appearing to pro&s;per, and views a country flouri&s;h|ing in wealth and indu&s;try; when he beholds the &s;pring coming forth in its beauty; and reviving the decayed face of nature; or in autumn beholds the fields loaded with plenty, and the year crowned with all its fruits; he lifts his affections with gratitude to the great Father of all, and rejoices in the general felicity and joy.</P>
<P>It may indeed be objected, that the &s;ame &s;en&s;ibility lays open the heart to be pierced with many wounds, from the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which abound in the world; expo&s;es us to frequent &s;uffering from the participation which it com|municates of the &s;orrows, as well as of the joys, of friend|&s;hip. But let it be con&s;idered, that the tender melan|choly of &s;ympathy, is accompanied with a &s;en&s;ation, which they who feel it would not exchange for the gratifications of the &s;elfi&s;h. When the heart is &s;trongly moved by any of the kind affections, even when it pours it&s;elf forth in virtuous &s;orrow, a &s;ecret attractive charm mingles with the painful emotion; there is a joy in the mid&s;t of grief. Let it be farther con&s;idered, that the griefs which &s;en&s;i|bility introduces, are counterbalanced by plea&s;ures which flow from the &s;ame &s;ource. Sen&s;ibility heightens in ge|neral the human powers, and is connected with acutene&s;s in all our feelings. If it makes us more alive to &s;ome painful &s;en&s;ations, in return, it renders the plea&s;ing ones more vivid and animated. The &s;elfi&s;h man langui&s;hes in his narrow circle of plea&s;ures. They are confined to what affects his own intere&s;t. He is obliged to repeat the &s;ame gratifications, till they become in&s;ipid. But the
<PB N="239" REF="038017_0239_1010D5C0A8D91B88">
man of virtuous &s;en&s;ibility moves in a wider &s;phere of felicity. His powers are much more frequently called forth into occupations of plea&s;ing activity. Numberle&s;s occa&s;ions open to him of indulging his favourite ta&s;te, by conveying &s;atisfaction to others. Often it is in his power, in one way or other, to &s;ooth the afflicted heart; to carry &s;ome con&s;olation into the hou&s;e of woe. In the &s;cenes of ordinary life, in the dome&s;tic and &s;ocial inter|cour&s;es of men, the cordiality of his affections cheers and gladdens him. Every appearance, every de&s;cription of innocent happine&s;s, is enjoyed by him. Every native expre&s;&s;ion of kindne&s;s and affection among others, is felt by him, even though he be not the object of it. Among a circle of friends, enjoying one another, he is as happy as the happie&s;t. In a word, he lives in a different &s;ort of world from what the &s;elfi&s;h man inhabits. He po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a new &s;en&s;e that enables him to behold objects which the &s;elfi&s;h cannot &s;ee. At the &s;ame time, his enjoyments are not of that kind which remain merely on the &s;urface of the mind. They penetrate the heart. They enlarge and elevate, they refine and ennoble it. To all the plea&s;|ing emotions of affection, they add the dignified con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of virtue.&mdash;Children of men! men formed by na|ture to live and to feel as brethren! how long will ye con|tinue to e&s;trange your&s;elves from one another by compe|titions and jealou&s;ies, when in cordial union ye might be &s;o much more ble&s;t? How long will ye &s;eek your happi|ne&s;s in &s;elfi&s;h gratifications alone, neglecting tho&s;e purer and better &s;ources of joy, which flow from the affections and the heart?</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XII. On the true Honour of Man.</HEAD>
<P>THE proper honour of man ari&s;es not from &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;plendid actions and abilities, which excite high ad|miration. Courage and prowe&s;s, military renown, &s;ignal victories and conque&s;ts, may render the name of a man famous without rendering his character truly honourable. To many brave men, to many heroes renowned in &s;tory, we look up with wonder. Their exploits are recorded. Their prai&s;es are &s;ung. They &s;tand as on an eminence above the re&s;t of mankind. Their eminence, neverthe|le&s;s, may not be of that &s;ort, before which we bow with inward e&s;teem and re&s;pect. Something more is wanted for that purpo&s;e, than the conquering arm, and the intre|pid mind. The laurels of the warrior mu&s;t at all times be dyed in blood, and bedewed with the tears of the wi|dow and the orphan. But if they have been &s;tained by rapine and inhumanity; if &s;ordid avarice has marked his character; or low and gro&s;s &s;en&s;uality has degraded his life; the great hero &s;inks into a little man. What at a di&s;tance, or on a &s;uperficial view, we admired, becomes mean, perhaps odious, when we examine it more clo&s;ely. It is like the Colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue, who&s;e immen&s;e &s;ize &s;truck the &s;pectator afar off with a&s;toni&s;hment; but when nearly viewed, it appears di&s;proportioned, un&s;hapely, and rude.</P>
<P>Ob&s;ervations of the &s;ame kind may be applied to all the reputation derived from civil accompli&s;hments; from the refined politics of the &s;tate&s;man; or the literary ef|forts

They di&s;cover talents which in them&s;elves are &s;hining; and which become highly valuable, when employed in advancing the good of mankind. Hence, they frequently give ri&s;e to fame. But a di&s;tinction is to be made between fame and true honour. The &s;tate&s;|man, the orator, or the poet, may be famous; while yet the man him&s;elf is far from being honoured. We envy his abilities. We wi&s;h to rival them. But we would not choo&s;e to be cla&s;&s;ed with him who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them. In&s;tances of this &s;ort are too often found in every record of ancient or modern hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>For all this it follows, that, in order to di&s;cern where man's true honour lies, we mu&s;t look, not to any adven|titious circum&s;tance of fortune; not to any &s;ingle &s;park|ling quality but to the whole of what forms a man; what entitles him, as &s;uch, to rank high among that cla&s;s of beings to which he belongs; in a word, we mu&s;t look to the mind and the &s;oul.&mdash;A mind &s;uperior to fear, to &s;elf|i&s;h intere&s;t and corruption; a mind governed by the prin|ciples of uniform rectitude and integrity; the &s;ame in pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity; which no bribe can &s;educe, nor terror overawe; neither by plea&s;ure melted into effemi|nacy, nor by di&s;tre&s;s &s;unk into dejection: &s;uch is the mind which forms the di&s;tinction and eminence of man.&mdash;One, who, in no &s;ituation of life, is either a&s;hamed or afraid of di&s;charging his duty, and acting his proper part with firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy; true to the God whom he wor|&s;hips, and true to the faith in which he profe&s;&s;es to be|lieve; full of affection to his brethren of mankind; faith|ful

<HEAD>SECTION XIII. The Influence of Devotion on the Happine&s;s of Life.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER promotes and &s;trengthens virtue, what|ever calms and regulates the temper, is a &s;ource of hap|pine&s;s. Devotion produces tho&s;e effects in a remarkable degree. It in&s;pires compo&s;ure of &s;pirit, mildne&s;s and be|nignity; weakens the painful, and cheri&s;hes the plea&s;ing emotions; and, by the&s;e means, carries on the life of a pious man in a &s;mooth and placid tenour.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides exerting this habitual influence on the mind, devotion opens a field of enjoyments, to which the vicious are entire &s;trangers; enjoyments the more valuable, as they peculiarly belong to retirement, when the world leaves us; and to adver&s;ity, when it becomes our foe.
<PB N="243" REF="038017_0243_1010D5CCCBEA6270">
The&s;e are the two &s;ea&s;ons, for which every wi&s;e man would mo&s;t wi&s;h to provide &s;ome hidden &s;tore of comfort. For let him be placed in the mo&s;t favourable &s;ituation which the human &s;tate admits, the world can neither al|ways amu&s;e him, nor always &s;hield him from di&s;tre&s;s. There will be many hours of vacuity, and many of de|jection, in his life. If he be a &s;tranger to God, and to devotion, how dreary will the gloom of &s;olitude often prove! With what oppre&s;&s;ive weight will &s;ickne&s;s, di&s;|appointment, or old age, fall upon his &s;pirits! But for tho&s;e pen&s;ive periods, the pious man has a relief prepar|ed. From the tire&s;ome repetition of the common vani|ties of life, or from the painful corro&s;ion of its cares and &s;orrows, devotion tran&s;ports him into a new region; and &s;urrounds him there with &s;uch objects, as are the mo&s;t fitted to cheer the dejection, to calm the tumults, and to heal the wounds of his heart. If the world has been empty and delu&s;ive, it gladdens him with the pro&s;pect of a higher and better order of things, about to ari&s;e. If men have been ungrateful and ba&s;e, it di&s;plays before him the faithfulne&s;s of that Supreme Being, who, though eve|ry other friend fail, will never for&s;ake him. Let us con|&s;ult our experience, and we &s;hall find, that the two great|e&s;t &s;ources of inward joy, are, the exerci&s;e of love di|rected towards a de&s;erving object, and the exerci&s;e of hope terminating on &s;ome high and a&s;&s;ured happine&s;s. Both the&s;e are &s;upplied by devotion; and therefore we have no rea&s;on to be &s;urpri&s;ed, if, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, it fills the hearts of good men with a &s;atisfaction not to be expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="038017_0244_1010D5CE54B64AB8">The refined plea&s;ures of a pious mind are, in many re|&s;pects, &s;uperior to the coar&s;e gratifications of &s;en&s;e. They are plea&s;ures which belong to the highe&s;t powers and be&s;t affections of the &s;oul; whereas the gratifications of &s;en&s;e re&s;ide in the lowe&s;t region of our nature. To the latter the &s;oul &s;toops below its native dignity. The for|mer, rai&s;e it above it&s;elf. The latter, leave always a comfortle&s;s, often a motifying, remembrance behind them. The former, are reviewed with applau&s;e and delight. The plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e re&s;emble a foaming torrent, which after a di&s;orderly cour&s;e, &s;peedily runs out, and leaves an empty and offen&s;ive channel. But the plea&s;ures of devo|tion re&s;emble the equable current of a pure river, which enlivens the fields through which it pa&s;&s;es, and diffu&s;es verdure and fertility along its banks. To thee, O De|votion! we owe the highe&s;t improvement of our nature, and much of the enjoyment of our life. Thou art the &s;upport of our virtue, and the re&s;t of our &s;ouls, in this tur|bulent world. Thou compo&s;e&s;t the thoughts. Thou calme&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions. Thou exalte&s;t the heart. Thy communications, and thine only, are imparted to the low, no le&s;s than to the high; to the poor, as well as to the rich. In thy pre&s;ence, wordly di&s;tinctions cea&s;e; and under thy influence, worldly &s;orrows are forgotten. Thou art the balm of the wounded mind.

<HEAD>SECTION XIV. The planetary and terre&s;trial Worlds comparatively con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>TO US, who dwell on its &s;urface, the earth is by far the mo&s;t exten&s;ive orb that our eyes can any where be|hold: it is al&s;o clothed with verdure, di&s;tingui&s;hed by trees, and adorned with a variety of beautiful decorations; whereas, to a &s;pectator placed on one of the planets, it wears a uniform a&s;pect; looks all luminous; and no larger than a &s;pot. To beings who dwell at &s;till greater di&s;tances, it entirely di&s;appears. That which we call alternately the morning and the evening &s;tar, as in one part of the orbit &s;he rides foremo&s;t in the proce&s;&s;ion of night, in the other u&s;hers in and anticipates the dawn, is a planetary world, which, with the four others that &s;o wonderfully vary their my&s;tic dance, are in them&s;elves dark bodies, and &s;hine only by reflection; have fields and &s;eas, and &s;kies of their own; are furni&s;hed with all accom|modations for animal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the abodes of intellectual life; all which, together with our earthly habitation, are dependent on that grand di&s;|pen&s;er of Divine munificence, the &s;un; receive their light from the di&s;tribution of his rays, and derive their comfort from his benign agency.</P>
<P>The &s;un, which &s;eems to perform its daily &s;tages through the &s;ky, is in this re&s;pect fixed and immoveable: it is the great axle of heaven, about which the globe we inhabit, and other more &s;pacious orbs, wheel their &s;tated cour&s;es. The &s;un, though &s;eemingly &s;maller than the
<PB N="246" REF="038017_0246_1010D5D6C4ABEC40">
dial it illuminates, is abundantly larger than this whole earth, on which &s;o many lofty mountains ri&s;e, and &s;uch va&s;t oceans roll. A line extending from &s;ide to &s;ide through the centre of that re&s;plendent orb, would mea|&s;ure more than eight hundred thou&s;and miles: a girdle formed to go round its circumference, would require a length of millions. Were its &s;olid contents to be e&s;tima|ted, the account would overwhelm our under&s;tanding, and be almo&s;t beyond the power of language to expre&s;s. Are we &s;tartled at the&s;e reports of philo&s;ophy? Are we ready to cry out in a tran&s;port of &s;urpri&s;e, "How mighty is the Being who kindled &s;uch a prodigious fire; and keeps alive, from age to age, &s;uch an enormous ma&s;s of flame!" let us attend our philo&s;ophic guides, and we &s;hall be brought acquainted with &s;peculations more en|larged and more inflaming.</P>
<P>This &s;un with all its attendant planets, is but a very little part of the grand machine of the univer&s;e; every &s;tar, though in appearance no bigger than the diamond that glitters upon a lady's rings, is really a va&s;t globe, like the &s;un in &s;ize and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lory; no le&s;s &s;pacious, no le&s;s lu|minous, than the radiant &s;ource of day. So that every &s;tar, is not barely a world, but the centre of a magnificent &s;y&s;tem; has a retinue of worlds, irradiated by its beams, and revolving round its attractive influence, all which are lo&s;t to our &s;ight in unmea&s;urable wilds of ether. That the &s;tars appear like &s;o many diminutive, and &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hable points, is owing to their immen&s;e and in|conceivable di&s;tance. Immen&s;e and inconceivable indeed it is, &s;ince a ball, &s;hot from the loaded cannon, and flying

with unabated rapidity, mu&s;t travel at this impetuous rate, almo&s;t &s;even hundred thou&s;and years, before it could reach the neare&s;t of the&s;e twinkling luminaries.</P>
<P>While, beholding this va&s;t expan&s;e, I learn my own extreme meanne&s;s, I would al&s;o di&s;cover the abject little|ne&s;s of all terre&s;trial things. What is the earth, with all her o&s;tentatious &s;cenes, compared with this a&s;toni&s;hing grand furniture of the &s;kies? What, but a dim &s;peck, hardly perceivable in the map of the univer&s;e? It is ob|&s;erved by a very judicious writer, that if the &s;un him&s;elf, which enlightens this part of the creation, were extin|gui&s;hed, and all the ho&s;t of planetary worlds, which move about him, were annihilated, they would not be mi&s;&s;ed by an eye that can take in the whole compa&s;s of nature, any more than a grain of &s;and upon the &s;ea-&s;hore. The bulk of which they con&s;i&s;t, and the &s;pace which they occupy, are &s;o exceedingly little in compari&s;on of the whole, that their lo&s;s would &s;carcely leave a blank in the immen&s;ity of God's works. If then, not our globe only, but this whole &s;y&s;tem, be &s;o very diminutive, what is a kingdom or a county? What are a few lord&s;hips, or the &s;o much admired patrimonies of tho&s;e who are &s;tyled wealthy? When I mea&s;ure them with my own little pittance, they &s;well into proud and bloated dimen&s;ions: but when I take the univer&s;e for my &s;tandard, how &s;canty is their &s;ize, how contemptible their figure! They &s;hrink into pom|pous nothings.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XV. On the Power of Cu&s;tom, and the U&s;es to which it may be applied.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not a common &s;aying, which has a better turn of &s;en&s;e in it, than what we often hear in the mouths of the vulgar, that 'Cu&s;tom is a &s;econd nature.' It is indeed able to form the man anew; and give him inclina|tions and capacities altogether different from tho&s;e he was born with. A per&s;on who is addicted to play or gaming, though he took but little delight in it at fir&s;t, by degrees contracts &s;o &s;trong an inclination towards it, and gives him&s;elf up &s;o entirely to it, that it &s;eems the only end of his being. The love of a retired or bu&s;y life will grow upon a man in&s;en&s;ibly, as he is conver&s;ant in the one or the other, till he is utterly unqualified for reli&s;hing that to which he has been for &s;ome time di&s;u&s;ed. Nay, a man may &s;moke, or drink, or take fnuff, till he is unable to pa&s;s away his time without it; not to mention how our delight in any particular &s;tudy, art, or &s;cience, ri&s;es and improves, in proportion to the application which we be&s;tow upon it. Thus, what was at fir&s;t an exerci&s;e, becomes at length an entertainment. Our employments are changed into diver&s;ions. The mind grows fond of tho&s;e actions it is accu&s;tomed to; and is drawn with re|luctancy from tho&s;e paths in which it has been u&s;ed to walk.</P>
<P>If we attentively con&s;ider this property of human na|ture, it may in&s;truct us in very fine moralities. In the fir&s;t place, I would have no man di&s;couraged with that
<PB N="249" REF="038017_0249_1010D5E01AF86758">
kind of life, or &s;eries of action, in which the choice of others, or his own nece&s;&s;ities, may have engaged him. It may perhaps be very di&s;agreeable to him, at fir&s;t; but u&s;e and application will certainly render it not only le&s;s painful, but plea&s;ing and &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, I would recommend to every one, the admirable precept, which Pythagoras is &s;aid to have given to his di&s;ciples, and which that philo&s;opher mu&s;t have drawn from the ob&s;ervation I have enlarged upon: "Pitch upon that cour&s;e of life which is the mo&s;t excel|lent, and cu&s;tom will render it the mo&s;t delightful." Men, who&s;e circum&s;tances will permit them to choo&s;e their own way of life, are inexcu&s;able if they do not pur&s;ue that which their judgment tells them is the mo&s;t laudable. The voice of rea&s;on is more to be regarded, than the bent of any pre&s;ent inclination; &s;ince, by the rule above mention|ed, inclination will at length come over to rea&s;on, though we can never force rea&s;on to comply with inclination.</P>
<P>In the third place, this ob&s;ervation may teach the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ual and irreligious man, to overlook tho&s;e hard&s;hips and difficulties, which are apt to di&s;courage him from the pro&s;ecution of a virtuous life. "The Gods," &s;aid He&s;i|od, "have placed labour before virtue; the way to her is at fir&s;t rough and difficult, but grows more &s;mooth and ea&s;y the farther we advance in it." The man who pro|ceeds in it with &s;teadine&s;s and re&s;olution, will in a little time, find that "her ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and that all her paths are peace."</P>
<P>To enforce this con&s;ideration, we may further ob&s;erve, that the practice of religion will not only be attended with
<PB N="250" REF="038017_0250_1010D5E322134828">
that plea&s;ure, which naturally accompanies tho&s;e actions to which we are habituated, but with tho&s;e &s;upernumerary joys of heart, that ri&s;e from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch a plea&s;ure; from the &s;atisfaction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cting up to the dictates of rea&s;on; and from the pro&s;pec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a happy immortality.</P>
<P>In the fourth place, we may learn from this ob&s;ervation, which we have made on the mind of man, to take parti|cular care, when we are once &s;ettled in a regular cour&s;e of life, how we too frequently indulge our&s;elves in even the mo&s;t innocent diver&s;ions and entertainments; &s;ince the mind may in&s;en&s;ibly fall off from the reli&s;h of virtu|ous actions, and, by degrees, exchange that plea&s;ure which it takes in the performance of its duty, for delights of a much inferior and an unprofitable nature.</P>
<P>The la&s;t u&s;e which I &s;hall make of this remarkable property in human nature, of being delighted with tho&s;e actions to which it is accu&s;tomed, is, to &s;how how ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary it is for us to gain habits of virtue in this life, if we would enjoy the plea&s;ures of the next. The &s;tate of bli&s;s, we call Heaven, will not be capable of affecting tho&s;e minds which are not thus qualified for it: we mu&s;t, in this world, gain a reli&s;h of truth and vir|tue, if we would be able to ta&s;te that knowledge and per|fection, which are to make us happy in the next. The &s;eeds of tho&s;e &s;piritual joys and raptures, which are to ri&s;e up and flouri&s;h in the &s;oul to all eternity, mu&s;t be planted in it during this its pre&s;ent &s;tate of probation. In &s;hort, heaven is not to be looked upon only as the reward, but as the natural effect, of a religious life.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XVII. De&s;cription of Candour.</HEAD>
<P>TRUE candour is altogether different from that guard|ed, inoffen&s;ive language, and that &s;tudied openne&s;s of be|haviour, which we &s;o frequently meet with among men of the world. Smiling, very often, is the a&s;pect, and &s;mooth are words, of tho&s;e who inwardly are the mo&s;t ready to think evil of others. That candour which is a Chri&s;tian virtue, con&s;i&s;ts, not in fairne&s;s of &s;peech, but in fairne&s;s of heart. It may want the blandi&s;hment of external courte&s;y, but &s;upplies its place with humane and generous liberality of &s;entiment. Its manners are unaffected, and its profe&s;&s;ions cordial. Exempt, on one hand, from the dark jealou&s;y of a &s;u&s;picious mind, it is no le&s;s removed, on the other, from that ea&s;y credulity which is impo&s;ed on by every &s;pecious pretence. It is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with exten&s;ive knowledge of the world, and with due atten|tion to our own &s;afety. In that various intercour&s;e, which we are obliged to carry on with per&s;ons of every differ|ent character, &s;u&s;picion, to a certain degree, is a nece&s;&s;a|ry guard. It is only when it exceeds the bounds of pru|dent caution, that it degenerates into vice. There is a proper mean between undi&s;tingui&s;hing credulity, and uni|ver&s;al jealou&s;y, which a &s;ound under&s;tanding di&s;cerns, and which the man of candour &s;tudies to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>He makes allowance for the mixture of evil with good, which is to be found in every human character. He ex|pects none to be faultle&s;s: and he is unwilling to believe
<PB N="253" REF="038017_0253_1010D5EAC4F2D0B0">
that there is any without &s;ome commendable quality. In the mid&s;t of many defects, he can di&s;cover a virtue. Un|der the influence of per&s;onal re&s;entment, he can be ju&s;t to the merit of an enemy. He never lends an open ear to tho&s;e defamatory reports and dark &s;ugge&s;tions, which, among the tribes of the cen&s;orious, circulate with &s;o much rapidity, and meet with &s;uch ready acceptance. He is not ha&s;ty to judge, and he requires full evidence before he will condemn. As long as an action can be a&s;cribed to different motives, he holds it as no mark of &s;agacity to impute it always to the wor&s;t. Where there is ju&s;t ground for doubt, he keeps his judgment undecided; and, during the period of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, leans to the mo&s;t charitable con&s;truction which an action can bear. When he mu&s;t condemn, he condemns with regret; and without tho&s;e aggravations which the &s;everity of others adds to the crime. He li&s;tens calmly to the apology of the offender, and readily admits every extenuating circum&s;tance, which equity can &s;ugge&s;t. How much &s;oever he may blame the principles of any &s;ect or party, he never confounds, un|der one general cen&s;ure, all who belong to that party or &s;ect. He charges them not with &s;uch con&s;equences of their tenets, as they refu&s;e and di&s;avow. From one wrong opinion, he does not infer the &s;ubver&s;ion of all &s;ound principles; nor from one bad action, conclude that all re|gard to con&s;cience is overthrown. When he "beholds the mote in his brother's eye," he remembers "the beam in his own." He commi&s;erates human frailty; and judges of others according to the principles, by which he would think it rea&s;onable that they &s;hould judge of him. In a word, he views men and actions in the clear

<HEAD>SECTION XVIII. On the Imperfection of that Happine&s;s which re&s;ts &s;olely on worldly Plea&s;ures.</HEAD>
<P>THE vanity of human plea&s;ures is a topic which might be embelli&s;hed with the pomp of much de&s;cription. But I &s;hall &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid exaggeration, and only point out a threefold vanity in human life, which every impar|tial ob&s;erver cannot but admit; di&s;appointment in pur|&s;uit, di&s;&s;atisfaction in enjoyment, uncertainty in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, di&s;appointment in pur&s;uit. When we look around us on the world, we every where behold a bu&s;y multitude, intent on the pro&s;ecution of various de&s;igns, which their wants or de&s;ires have &s;ugge&s;ted. We be|hold them employing every method which ingenuity can devi&s;e; &s;ome the patience of indu&s;try, &s;ome the boldne&s;s of enterprize, others the dexterity of &s;tratagem, in order to compa&s;s their ends. Of this ince&s;&s;ant &s;tir and activity, what is the fruit? In compari&s;on of the crowd who have toiled in vain, how &s;mall is the number of the &s;ucce&s;sful? Or rather where is the man who will declare, that in every point he has completed his plan, and attained his utmo&s;t wi&s;h? No extent of human abilities has been able to di&s;cover a path which, in any line of life, leads un|erringly to &s;ucce&s;s. "The race is not always to the
<PB N="255" REF="038017_0255_1010D5EF6E3FCC48">
&s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong, nor riches to men of under&s;tanding." We may form our plans with the mo&s;t profound &s;agacity, and with the mo&s;t vigilant caution may guard again&s;t dangers on every &s;ide. But &s;ome unfore|&s;een occurrence comes acro&s;s, which baffles our wi&s;dom, and lays our labours in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>Were &s;uch di&s;appointments confined to tho&s;e who a&s;|pire at engro&s;&s;ing the higher departments of life, the misfortune would be le&s;s. The humiliation of the migh|ty, and the fall of ambition from its towering height, lit|tle concern the bulk of mankind. The&s;e are objects on which, as on di&s;tant meteors, they gaze from afar, without drawing per&s;onal in&s;truction from events &s;o much above them. But, alas! when we de&s;cend into the re|gions of private life, we find di&s;appointment and bla&s;ted hope equally prevalent there. Neither the moderation of our views, nor the ju&s;tice of our preten&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ons, can en|&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. But "time and chace happen to all." A|gain&s;t the &s;tream of events, both the worthy and the un|de&s;erving are obliged to &s;truggle; and both are frequent|ly overborn alike by the current.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides di&s;appointment in pur&s;uit, di&s;&s;atisfaction in enjoyment is a farther vanity, to which the human &s;tate is &s;ubject. This is the &s;evere&s;t of all mortifications, af|ter having been &s;ucce&s;sful in the pur&s;uit, to be baffled in the enjoyment it&s;elf. Yet this is found to be an evil &s;till more general than the former. Some may be &s;o fortunate as to attain what they have pur&s;ued; but none are ren|dered completely happy by what they have attained. Di&s;appointed hope is mi&s;ery; and yet &s;ucce&s;sful hope is only imperfect bli&s;s. Look through all the ranks of
<PB N="256" REF="038017_0256_1010D5F40F173C48">
mankind. Examine the condition of tho&s;e who appear mo&s;t pro&s;perous; and you will find that they are never ju&s;t what they de&s;ire to be. If retired, they langui&s;h for action; if bu&s;y, they complain of fatigue. If in middle life, they are impatient for di&s;tinction; if in high &s;tations, they &s;igh after freedom and ea&s;e. Something is &s;till wanting to that plenitude of &s;atisfaction, which they expected to acquire. Together with every wi&s;h that is gratified, a new demand ari&s;es. One void opens in the heart, as another is filled. On wi&s;hes, wi&s;hes grow; and to the end, it is rather the expectation of what they have not, than the enjoyment of what they have, which occupies and intere&s;ts the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>This di&s;&s;atisfaction in the mid&s;t of human plea&s;ure, &s;prings partly from the nature of our enjoyments them|&s;elves, and partly from circum&s;tances which corrupt them. No worldly enjoyments are adequate to the high de&s;ires and powers of an immortal &s;pirit. Fancy paints them at a di&s;tance with &s;plendid colours; but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion unveils the fallacy. The eagerne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion be&s;tows upon them, at fir&s;t a bri&s;k and lively reli&s;h. But it is their fate always to pall by familiarity, and &s;ometimes to pa&s;s from &s;atiety into di&s;gu&s;t. Happy would the poor man think him&s;elf, if he could enter on all the trea&s;ures of the rich; and happy for a &s;hort time he might be: but before he had long contemplated and admired his &s;tate, his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions would &s;eem to le&s;&s;en, and his cares would grow.</P>
<P>Add to the un&s;atisfying nature of our plea&s;ures, the attending circum&s;tances which never fail to corrupt them. For, &s;uch as they are, they are at no time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed un|mixed. To human lips it is not given to ta&s;te the cup
<PB N="257" REF="038017_0257_1010D5F767BEB2A8">
of pure joy. When external circum&s;tances &s;how faire&s;t to the world, the envied man groans in private under his own burden. Some vexation di&s;quiets, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion corrodes him; &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s, either felt or feared, gnaws, like a worm, the root of his felicity. When there is no|thing from without to di&s;turb the pro&s;perous, a &s;ecret poi&s;on operates within. For worldly happine&s;s ever tends to de&s;troy it&s;elf, by corrupting the heart. It fo&s;ters the loo&s;e and the violent pa&s;&s;ions. It engenders noxious habits; and taints the mind with fal&s;e delicacy, which makes it feel a thou&s;and unreal evils.</P>
<P>But put the ca&s;e in the mo&s;t favourable light. Lay a&s;ide from human plea&s;ures both di&s;appointment in pur|&s;uit, and deceitfulne&s;s in enjoyment; &s;uppo&s;e them to be fully attainable, and completely &s;atisfactory; &s;till there remains to be con&s;idered the vanity of uncertain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on and &s;hort duration. Were there i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> worldly things any fixed point of &s;ecurity which we could gain, the mind would then have &s;ome ba&s;is on which to re&s;t. But our condition is &s;uch, that every thing wavers and tot|ters around us. "Boa&s;t not thy&s;elf of to-morrow; for thou knowe&s;t not what a day may bring forth." It is much if, during its cour&s;e, thou heare&s;t not of &s;omewhat to di&s;quiet or alarm thee. For life never proceeds long in a uniform train. It is continually varied by unex|pected events. The &s;eeds of alteration are every where &s;own; and the &s;un&s;hine of pro&s;perity commonly acce|lerates their growth. If our enjoyments be numerous, we lie more open on different &s;ides to be wounded. If we have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them long, we have greater cau&s;e to dread an approach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng change. By &s;low degrees pro|&s;perity
<PB N="258" REF="038017_0258_1010D5FBA87AD2D0">
ri&s;es; but rapid is the progre&s;s of evil. It re|quires no preparation to bring it forward. The edifice which it co&s;t much time and labour to erect, one inau&s;|picious event, one &s;udden blow, can level with the du&s;t. Even &s;uppo&s;ing the accidents of life to leave us untouch|ed, human bli&s;s mu&s;t &s;till be tran&s;itory; for man changes of him&s;elf. No cour&s;e of enjoyment can delight us long. What amu&s;ed our youth, lo&s;es its charm in ma|turer age. As years advance, our powers are blunted, and our plea&s;urable feelings decline. The &s;ilent lap&s;e of time is ever carrying &s;omewhat from us, till at length the period comes, when all mu&s;t be &s;wept away. The pro&s;pect of this termination of our labours and pur&s;uits, is &s;ufficient to mark our &s;tate with vanity. "Our days are a hand-breadth, and our age is a nothing." With|in that little &s;pace is all our enterp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e bounded. We crowd it with toils and cares, with contention and &s;trife. We project great de&s;igns, entertain high hopes, and then leave our plans unfini&s;hed, and &s;ink into obli|vion.</P>
<P>This much let it &s;uffice to have &s;aid concerning the vanity of the world. That too much has not been &s;aid, mu&s;t appear to every one who con&s;iders how generally mankind lean to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide; and how often, by undue attachment to the pre&s;ent &s;tate, they both feed the mo&s;t &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions, and "pierce them&s;elves through with many &s;orrows."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIX. What are the real and &s;olid enjoyments of Human Life</HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t be admitted, that unmixed and complete hap|pine&s;s is unknown on earth. No regulation of conduct can altogether prevent pa&s;&s;ions from di&s;turbing our peace, and misfortunes from wounding our heart. But after this conce&s;&s;ion is made, will it follow, that there is no ob|ject on earth which de&s;erves our pur&s;uit, or that all en|joyment becomes contemptible which is not perfect? Let us &s;urvey our &s;tate with an impartial eye, and be ju&s;t to the various gifts of Heaven. How vain &s;oever this life, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, may be, the comforts and hopes of re|ligion are &s;ufficient to give &s;olidity to the enjoyments of the righteous. In the exerci&s;e of good affections, and the te&s;timony of an approving con&s;cience; in the &s;en&s;e of peace and reconciliation with God, through the great Redeemer of mankind; in the firm confidence of being conducted through all the trials of life, by infinite wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s; and in the joyful pro&s;pect of arriving, in the end, at immortal felicity, they po&s;&s;e&s;s a happine&s;s which, de&s;cending from a purer and more perfect region than this world, partakes not of its vanity.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the enjoyments peculiar to religion, there are other plea&s;ures of our pre&s;ent &s;tate, which, though of an inferior order, mu&s;t not be overlooked in the e&s;timate of human life. It is nece&s;&s;ary to call attention to the&s;e, in order to check that repining and unthankful &s;pirit to
<PB N="260" REF="038017_0260_1010D6001F503858">
which man is always too prone. Some degree of impor|tance mu&s;t be allowed to the comforts of health, to the innocent gratifications of &s;en&s;e, and to the entertainment afforded us by all the beautiful &s;cenes of nature; &s;ome to the pur&s;uits and harmle&s;s amu&s;ements of &s;ocial life; and more to the internal enjoyments of thought and reflection, and to the plea&s;ures of affectionate intercour&s;e with tho&s;e whom we love. The&s;e comforts are often held in too low e&s;timation, merely becau&s;e they are ordinary and com|mon; although that is the circum&s;tance which ought, in rea&s;on, to enhance their value.

<P>THOUGH there is a great deal of plea&s;ure in contem|plating the material world; by which I mean, that &s;y&s;tem of bodies, into which nature has &s;o curiou&s;ly wrought the ma&s;s of dead matter, with the &s;everal relations that tho&s;e bodies bear to one another; there is &s;till, methinks, &s;omething more wonderful and &s;urpri&s;ing, in contempla|tions on the world of life; by which I under&s;tand, all tho&s;e animals with which every part of the univer&s;e is furni&s;hed. The material world is only the &s;hell of the univer&s;e: the world of life are its inhabitants.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider tho&s;e parts of the material world, which lie the neare&s;t to us, and are therefore &s;ubject to our ob|&s;ervations

and inquiries, it is amazing to con&s;ider the in|finity of animals with which it is &s;tocked. Every part of matter is peopled; every green leaf &s;warms with in|habitants. There is &s;carcely a &s;ingle humour in the body of a man, or of any other animal, in which our gla&s;&s;es do not di&s;cover myriads of living creatures. We find, even in the mo&s;t &s;olid bodies, as in marble it&s;elf, innume|rable cells and cavities, which are crowded with &s;uch imperceptible inhabitants, as are too little for the naked eye to di&s;cover. On the other hand, if we look into the more bulky parts of nature, we &s;ee the &s;eas, lakes, and rivers, teeming with numberle&s;s kinds of living creatures. We find every mountain and mar&s;h, wilderne&s;s and wood, plentifully &s;tocked with birds and bea&s;ts; and every part of matter affording proper nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies, for the livelihood of multitudes which inhabit it.</P>
<P>The author of "the Plurality of Worlds," draws a very good argument from this con&s;ideration, for the peo|pling of every planet; as indeed it &s;eems very probable, from the analogy of rea&s;on, that if no part of matter, with which we are acquainted, lies wa&s;te and u&s;ele&s;s, tho&s;e great bodies, which are at &s;uch a di&s;tance from us, are not de&s;ert and unpeopled; but rather, that they are fur|ni&s;hed with beings adapted to their re&s;pective &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Exi&s;tence is a ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e beings only which are endowed with perception; and is in a manner thrown away upon dead matter, any farther than as it is &s;ub&s;er|vient to beings which are con&s;cious of their exi&s;tence. Accordingly we find, from the bodies which lie under our ob&s;ervation, that matter is only made as the ba&s;is and
<PB N="263" REF="038017_0263_1010D60AF47E4350">
&s;upport of animals; and that there is no more of the one than what is nece&s;&s;ary for the exi&s;tence of the other.</P>
<P>Infinite Goodne&s;s is of &s;o communicative a nature, that it &s;eems to delight in conferring exi&s;tence upon every degree of perceptive being. As this is a &s;peculation, which I have often pur&s;ued with great plea&s;ure to my|&s;elf, I &s;hall enlarge farther upon it, by con&s;idering that part of the &s;cale of beings, which comes within our knowledge.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome living creatures, which are rai&s;ed but ju&s;t above dead matter. To mention only that &s;pecies of &s;hell-fi&s;h, which is formed in the fa&s;hion of a cone; that grows to the &s;urface ef &s;everal rocks; and imme|diately dies, on being &s;evered from the place where it grew. There are many other creatures but one remove from the&s;e, which have no other &s;en&s;e than that of feeling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd ta&s;te. Others have &s;till an additional one of hearing; others, of &s;mell; and others, of &s;ight. It is wonderful to ob&s;erve, by what a gradual progre&s;s the world of life advances, through a prodigious variety of &s;pecies, before a creature is formed, that is complete in all its &s;en&s;es: and even among the&s;e, there is &s;uch a different degree of perfection, in the &s;en&s;e which one animal enjoys beyond what appears in another, that though the &s;en&s;e in different animals is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame common denomina|tion, it &s;eems almo&s;t of a different nature. If, after this, we look into the &s;everal inward perfections, of cunning and &s;agacity, or what we generally call in&s;tinct, we find them ri&s;ing, after the &s;ame manner, imperceptibly one above another; and receiving additional improvements, according to the &s;pecies in which they are implanted.
<PB N="264" REF="038017_0264_1010D60DDB099D98">
This progre&s;s in nature is &s;o very gradual, that the mo&s;t perfect of an inferior &s;pecies, comes very near to the mo&s;t imperfect of that which is immediately above it.</P>
<P>The exuberant and overflowing goodne&s;s of the Su|preme Being, who&s;e mercy extends to all his works, is plainly &s;een, as I have before hinted, in his having made &s;o very little matter, at lea&s;t what falls within our know|ledge, that does not &s;warm with life. Nor is his good|ne&s;s le&s;s &s;een in the diver&s;ity, than in the multitude of living creatures. Had he made but one &s;pecies of ani|mals, none of the re&s;t would have enjoyed the happine&s;s of exi&s;tence: he has therefore, <HI>&s;pecified,</HI> in his creation, every degree of life, every capacity of being. The whole cha&s;m of nature, from a plant to a man, is filled up with diver&s;e kinds of creatures, ri&s;ing one after another, by &s;uch a gentle and ea&s;y a&s;cent, that the little tran&s;itions and deviations from one &s;pecies to another, are almo&s;t in&s;en|&s;ible. This intermediate &s;pace is &s;o well hu&s;banded and managed, that there is &s;carcely a degree of perception, which does not appear in &s;ome one part of the world of life. Is the goodne&s;s, or the wi&s;dom of the Divine Being, more manife&s;ted in this his proceeding?</P>
<P>There is a con&s;equence, be&s;ides tho&s;e I have already mentioned, which &s;eems very naturally deducible from the foregoing con&s;iderations. If the &s;cale of being ri&s;es by &s;uch a regular progre&s;s, &s;o high as man, we may, by parity of rea&s;on, &s;uppo&s;e, that it &s;till proceeds gradually through tho&s;e beings which are of a &s;uperior nature to him; &s;ince there is infinitely great|er &s;pace and room for different degree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of perfection;

between the Supreme Being and man, than between man and the mo&s;t de&s;picable in&s;ect.</P>
<P>In this great &s;y&s;tem of being, there is no creature &s;o wonderful in its nature, and which &s;o much de&s;erves our particular attention, as man; who fills up the middle &s;pace between the animal and the intellectual nature, the vi&s;ible and the invi&s;ible world; and who is that link in the chain of beings, which forms the connexion between both. So that he who, in one re&s;pect, is a&s;&s;ociated with angels and arch-angels, and may look upon a being of infinite per|fection as his father, and the highe&s;t order of &s;pirits as his brethren, may, in another re&s;pect, &s;ay, to "corruption, thou art my father, and to the worm, thou art my mother and my &s;i&s;ter."</P>

who knows the a&s;&s;i&s;tance we &s;tand in need of, and is al|ways ready to be&s;tow it on tho&s;e who a&s;k it of him.</P>
<P>The natural homage, which &s;uch a creature bears to &s;o infinitely wi&s;e and good a Being, is a firm reliance on him for the ble&s;&s;ings and conveniences of life; and an habitual tru&s;t in him, for deliverance out of all &s;uch dan|gers and difficulties as may befall us.</P>
<P>The man who always lives in this di&s;po&s;ition of mind, has not the &s;ame dark and melancholy views of human nature, as he who con&s;iders him&s;elf ab&s;tractedly from this relation to the Supreme Being. At the &s;ame time that he reflects upon his own weakne&s;s and imperfection, he comforts him&s;elf with the contemplation of tho&s;e divine attributes, which are employed for his &s;afety, and his wel|fare. He finds his want of fore&s;ight made up, by the omni&s;cience of him who is his &s;upport. He is not &s;en&s;i|ble of his own want of &s;trength, when he knows that his helper is almighty. In &s;hort, the per&s;on who has a firm tru&s;t on the Supreme Being, is powerful in his power, wi&s;e by his wi&s;dom, happy by his happine&s;s. He reaps the benefit of every divine attribute; and lo&s;es his own in&s;ufficiency in the fulne&s;s of infinite perfection.</P>
<P>To make our lives more ea&s;y to us, we are command|ed to put our tru&s;t in him, who is thus able to relieve and &s;uccour us; the Divine goodne&s;s having made &s;uch a reliance a duty, notwith&s;tanding we &s;hould have been mi&s;erable, had it been forbidden us.</P>
<P>Among &s;everal motives, which might be made u&s;e of to recommend this duty to us, I &s;hall only take notice of tho&s;e that follow.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t is, that we are promi&s;ed, He will not fail tho&s;e who put their tru&s;t in him.</P>

A per|&s;on who believes he has his &s;uccour at hand, and that he acts in the &s;ight of his friend, often exerts him&s;elf beyond his abilities; and does wonders, that are not to be match|ed by one who is not animated with &s;uch a confidence of &s;ucce&s;s.

<HEAD>SECTION XXII. Piety and Gratitude enliven Pro&s;perity.</HEAD>
<P>PIETY, and gratitude to God, contribute, in a high degree, to enliven pro&s;perity. Gratitude is a plea&s;ing emotion. The &s;en&s;e of being di&s;tingui&s;hed by the kind|ne&s;s of another gladdens the heart, warms it with recipro|cal affection, and gives to any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which is agree|able in it&s;elf, a double reli&s;h, from its being the gift of a friend. Favours conferred by men, I acknowledge, may prove burden&s;ome. For human virtue is never perfect; and &s;ometimes unrea&s;onable expectations on the one &s;ide, &s;ometimes a mortifying &s;en&s;e of dependence on the other, corrode in &s;ecret the plea&s;ure of benefits, and convert the obligations of friend&s;hip into grounds of jealou&s;y. But nothing of this kind can affect the intercour&s;e of grati|tude with Heaven. Its favours are wholly di&s;intere&s;ted; and with a gratitude the mo&s;t cordial and un&s;u&s;picious, a good man looks up to that Almighty Benefactor, who aims at no end but the happine&s;s of tho&s;e whom he ble&s;&s;es, and who de&s;ires no return f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om them, but a devout and thankful heart. While others can trace their pro&s;perity to no higher &s;ource than a concurrence of worldly cau&s;es; and, often, of mean or trifling incidents, which occa&s;ion|ally favoured their de&s;igns; with what &s;uperior &s;atisfac|tion does the &s;ervant of God remark the hand of that Gracious Power which hath rai&s;ed him up; which hath happily conducted him through the various &s;teps of life,
<PB N="269" REF="038017_0269_1010D61D416427C8">
and crowned him with the mo&s;t favourable di&s;tinction be|yond his equals?</P>
<P>Let us farther con&s;ider, that not only gratitude for the the pa&s;t, but a cheering &s;en&s;e of Divine favour at the pre|&s;ent, enters into the pious emotion. They are only the virtuous, who in their pro&s;perous days hear this voice ad|dre&s;&s;ed to them, "Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a cheerful heart; for God now accepteth thy works." He who is the Author of their pro&s;perity, gives them a title to enjoy, with complacency, his own gift. While bad men &s;natch the plea&s;ures of the world as by &s;tealth, without countenance from the Great Proprietor of the world&punc; the righteous &s;it openly down to the fea&s;t of life, under the &s;mile of approving Heaven. No guilty fears damp their joys. The ble&s;&s;ing of God re&s;ts upon all that they po&s;&s;e&s;s; his protection &s;urrounds them; and hence, "in the habitations of the righteous, is found the voice of rejoicing and &s;alvation." A lu&s;tre unknown to others, inve&s;ts, in their &s;ight, the whole face of nature. Their piety reflects a &s;un&s;hine from heaven upon the pro&s;perity of the world; unites in one point of view, the &s;miling a&s;pect, both of the powers above, and of the objects below. Not only have they as full a reli&s;h as others, of the innocent plea&s;ures of life, but, moreover, in the&s;e they hold communion with their Divine Benefactor. In all that is good or fair, they trace his hand. From the beauties of nature, from the im|provements of art, from the enjoyments of &s;ocial life, they rai&s;e their affection to the &s;ource of all the happine&s;s which &s;urrounds them; and thus widen the &s;phere of their plea|&s;ures, by adding intellectual, and &s;piritual, to earthly j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ys.</P>

<P>THE city of Sidon having &s;urrendered to Alexander, he ordered Hephe&s;tion to be&s;tow the crown on him whom the Sidonians &s;hould think mo&s;t worthy of that honor. Hephe&s;tion being at that time re&s;ident with two young men of di&s;tinction, offered them the kingdom; but they refu&s;ed, it telling him that it was contrary to the laws of their country, to admit any one to that honor, who was not of the royal family.

<P>All this, at the fir&s;t, appeared to Abdolonymus as an illu&s;ion of the fancy, or an in&s;ult offered to his poverty.

What value, then, can I put on thy gold and &s;ilver? What king can add any thing to my fortune? Always attentive to di&s;charge the duties incumbent upon me, I have a mind free from &s;elf-reproach; and I have an hone&s;t fame.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXV. Character of James I, King of England.</HEAD>
<P>No Prince, &s;o little enterpri&s;ing and &s;o inoffen&s;ive, was ever &s;o much expo&s;ed to the oppo&s;ite extremes of calumny and flattery, of &s;atire and panegyric. And the factions which began in his time, being &s;till continued, have made his character be as much di&s;puted to this day, as is commonly that of princes who are our contempo|raries. Many virtues, however, it mu&s;t be owned, he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; but not one of them pure, or free from the contagion of the neighbouring vices. His genero&s;ity bordered on profu&s;ion, his learning on pedantry, his pa|cific di&s;po&s;ition on pu&s;illanimity, his wi&s;dom on cunning, his friend&s;hip on light fancy and boyi&s;h fondne&s;s. While he imagined that he was only maintaining his own au|thority, he may perhaps be &s;u&s;pected in &s;ome of his ac|tions, and &s;till more of his preten&s;ions, to have encroach|ed on the liberties of his people. While he endeavoured,
<PB N="275" REF="038017_0275_1010D62E16B8F4A0">
by an exact neutrality, to acquire the good-will of all his neighbours, he was able to pre&s;erve fully the e&s;teem and regard of none. His capacity was con&s;iderable, but fit|ter to di&s;cour&s;e on general maxims, than to conduct any intricate bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>His intentions were ju&s;t, but more adapted to the con|duct of private life, than to the government of kingdoms. Aukward in his per&s;on, and ungainly in his manners, he was ill qualified to command re&s;pect: partial and undi&s;|cerning in his affections, he was little fitted to acquire general love. Of a feeble temper, more than of a fru|gal judgment; expo&s;ed to our ridicule from his vanity, but exempt from our hatred by his freedom from pride and arrogance. And, upon the whole, it may be pro|nounced of his character, that all his qualities were &s;ul|lied with weakne&s;s, and embelli&s;hed by humanity. Po|litical courage he was certainly devoid of; and from thence chiefly is derived the &s;trong prejudice, which pre|vails again&s;t his per&s;onal bravery: an inference, how|ever, which mu&s;t be owned, from general experience, to be extremely fallacious.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXVI. Charles V. Emperor of Germany, re&s;igns his Dominions, and retires from the World.</HEAD>
<P>THIS great Emperor, in the plenitude of his power, and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the honours which can flatter the heart of man, took the extraordinary re&s;olution, to re|&s;ign
<PB N="276" REF="038017_0276_1010D630CD91A9D0">
his kingdoms; and to withdraw entirely from any concern in bu&s;ine&s;s or the affairs of this world, in order that he might &s;pend the remainder of his days in retire|ment and &s;olitude. Though it requires neither deep re|flection, nor extraordinary di&s;cernment, to di&s;cover that the &s;tate of royalty is not exempt from cares and di&s;ap|pointments; though mo&s;t of tho&s;e who are exalted to a throne, find &s;olicitude, and &s;atiety, and di&s;gu&s;t, to be their perpetual attendants, in that envied pre-eminence; yet, to de&s;cend voluntarily from the &s;upreme to a &s;ubordinate &s;tation, and to relinqui&s;h the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power in or|der to attain the enjoyment of happine&s;s, &s;eems to be an effort too great for the human mind. Several in&s;tances, indeed, occur in hi&s;tory, of monarchs who have quitted a throne, and have ended their days in retirement. But they were either weak princes, who took this re&s;olution ra&s;hly, and repented of it as &s;oon as it was taken; or unfortunate princes, from who&s;e hands &s;ome &s;trong rival had wre&s;ted their &s;ceptre, and compelled them to de&s;cend with reluctance into a private &s;tation. Diocle&s;ian is, perhaps, the only prince capable of holding the reins of government, who ever re&s;igned them from deliberate choice; and who continued, during many years, to enjoy the tranquility of retirement, without fetching one peni|tent &s;igh, or ca&s;ting back one look of de&s;ire, towards the power or dignity which he had abandoned.</P>
<P>No wonder, then, that Charles's re&s;ignation &s;hould fill all Europe with a&s;toni&s;hment; and give ri&s;e, both among his contemporaries, and among the hi&s;torians of that period, to various conjectures concerning the motives which determined a prince, who&s;e ruling

pa&s;&s;ion had been uniformly the love of power, at the age of fifty-&s;ix, when objects of ambition operate with full force on the mind, and are pur&s;ued with the greate&s;t ar|dour, to take a re&s;olution &s;o &s;ingular and unexpected.</P>
<P>The emperor, in pur&s;uance of his determination, having a&s;&s;embled the &s;tates of the Low Countries at Bru&s;|&s;els, &s;eated him&s;elf, for the la&s;t time, in the chair of &s;tate; on one &s;ide of which was placed his &s;on, and on the other, his &s;i&s;ter the queen of Hungary, regent of the Nether|lands, with a &s;plendid retinue of the grandees of Spain and the princes of the empire &s;tanding behind him. The pre&s;ident of the council of Flanders, by his command, explained, in a few words, his intention in calling this extraordinary meeting of the &s;tates. He then read the in&s;trument of re&s;ignation, by which Charles &s;urrendered to his &s;on Philip all his territories, juri&s;diction, and au|thority in the Low Countries; ab&s;olving his &s;ubjects there from their oath of allegiance to him, which he re|quired them to transfer to Philip his lawful heir; and to &s;erve him with the &s;ame loyalty and zeal that they ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> manife&s;ted, during &s;o long a cour&s;e of years, in &s;upport of his government.</P>
<P>Charles then ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and leaning on the &s;houlder of the Prince of Orange, becau&s;e he was unable to &s;tand without &s;upport, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the au|dience; and, from a paper which he held in his hand, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t his memory, he recounted, with dignity, but without o&s;tentation, all the great things which he had undertaken and performed, &s;ince the commence|ment of his admini&s;tration. He ob&s;erved, that from the &s;eventeenth year of his age, he had dedicated all
<PB N="278" REF="038017_0278_1010D637166FE580">
his thoughts and attention to public objects, re&s;erving no portion of his time for the indulgence of his ea&s;e, and very little for the enjoyment of private plea&s;ure; that either in a pacific or ho&s;tile manner, he had vi&s;ited Germany nine times, Spain &s;ix times, France four times, Italy &s;even times, the Low Countries ten times, England twice, Africa as often, and had made eleven voyages by &s;ea; that while his health permitted him to di&s;charge his duty, and the vigour of his con&s;titution was equal in any degree, to the arduous office of governing &s;uch exten&s;ive dominions, he had never &s;hunned labour, nor repined un|der fatigue; that now, when his health was broken, and his vigour exhau&s;ted by the rage of an incurable di&s;|temper, his growing infirmities admoni&s;hed him to re|tire; nor was he &s;o fond of reigning, as to retain the &s;ceptre in an impotent hand, which was no longer able to protect his &s;ubjects, or to render them happy; that in|&s;tead of a &s;overeign worn out with di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;carcely half alive, he gave them one in the prime of life, accu&s;|tomed already to govern, and who added to the vigour of youth all the attention and &s;agacity of maturer years&punc; that if, during the cour&s;e of a long admini&s;tration, he had committed any material error in government, or if, under the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;o many and great affairs, and amid&s;t the attention which he had been obliged to give to them, he had either neglected or injured any of his &s;ub|jects, he now implored their forgivene&s;s; that, for his part, he &s;hould ever retain a grateful &s;en&s;e of their fideli|ty and attachment, and would carry the remembrance of it along with him to the place of his retreat, as his &s;weet|e&s;t con&s;olation, as well as the be&s;t reward for all his &s;er|vices;
<PB N="279" REF="038017_0279_1010D63A10534E58">
and, in his la&s;t prayers to Almighty God, would pour forth his ardent wi&s;hes for their welfare.</P>
<P>Then turning towards Philip, who fell on his knees and ki&s;&s;ed his father's hand, "If," &s;ays he, "I had left you, by my death, this rich inheritance, to which I have made &s;uch large additions, &s;ome regard would have been ju&s;tly due to my memory on that account; but now, when I voluntarily re&s;ign to you what I might have &s;till retained, I may well expect the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of thanks on your part. With the&s;e, however, I di&s;pen&s;e; and &s;hall con&s;ider your concern for the welfare of your &s;ubjects, and your love of them, as the be&s;t and mo&s;t ac|ceptable te&s;timony of your gratitude to me. It is in your power, by a wi&s;e and virtuous admini&s;tration, to ju&s;tify the extraordinary proof which I give this day of my pa|ternal affection, and to demon&s;trate that you are worthy of the confidence which I repo&s;e in you. Pre&s;erve an inviolable regard for religion; maintain the Catholic faith in its purity; let the laws of your country be &s;acred in your eyes; encroach not on the rights and privileges of your people; and, if the time &s;hall ever come, when you &s;hall wi&s;h to enjoy the tranquility of private life, may you have a &s;on endowed with &s;uch qualities, that you can re&s;ign your &s;ceptre to him, with as much &s;atisfaction as I give up mine to you."</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Charles had fini&s;hed this long addre&s;s to his &s;ubjects, and to their new &s;overeign, he &s;unk into the chair, exhau&s;ted and ready to faint with the fatigue of &s;uch an extraordinary effort. During his di&s;cour&s;e, the whole audience melted into tears; &s;ome from admiration of his magnanimity; others &s;oftened by the expre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="280" REF="038017_0280_1010D63D2B891888">
of tenderne&s;s towards his &s;on, and of love to his people; and all were affected with the deepe&s;t &s;orrow, at lo&s;ing a &s;overeign, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed the Netherlands, his native country, with particular marks of his regard and attachment.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXVII. Continuation of the Emperor <HI>CHARLES V.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A FEW weeks after the re&s;ignation of the Nether|lands, Charles, in an a&s;&s;embly no le&s;s &s;plendid, and with a ceremonial equally pompous, re&s;igned to the &s;on the crowns of Spain, with all the territories depending on them, both in the old and in the new world. Of all the&s;e va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he re&s;erved nothing for him&s;elf, but an an|nual pen&s;ion of an hundred thou&s;and crowns, to defray the charges of his family, and to afford him a &s;mall &s;um for acts of beneficence and charity.</P>
<P>Nothing now remained to detain him from that retreat for which he langui&s;hed. Every thing having been pre|pared &s;ome time for his voyage, he &s;et out for Zuitburg in Zealand, where the fleet had orders to rendezvous. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n his way thither, he pa&s;&s;ed through Ghent; and after &s;topping there a few days, to indulge that tender and plea&s;ant melancholy, which ari&s;es in the mind of every than in the decline of life, on vi&s;iting the place o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his na|tivity, and viewing the &s;cenes and objects fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iliar to him in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s early youth, he pur&s;ued his journey, accompa|nie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by his &s;on Philip, his daughter the Arch-duche&s;s, his &s;i&s;ters the Dowager Queens of France and Hungary, Maximilian his &s;on-in-law, and a numerous retinue of
<PB N="281" REF="038017_0281_1010D6403396B9E0">
the Flemi&s;h nobility. Before he went on board, he di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed them, with marks of his attention or regard; and taking leave of Philip with all the tenderne&s;s of a father who embraced his &s;on for the la&s;t time, he &s;et &s;ail under convoy of a large fleet of Spani&s;h, Flemi&s;h, and Engli&s;h &s;hips.</P>
<P>His voyage was pro&s;perous and agreeable; and he ar|rived at Laredo in Bi&s;cay, on the eleventh day after he left Zealand. As &s;oon as he landed, he fell pro&s;trate on the ground and con&s;idering him&s;elf now as dead to the world, he ki&s;&s;ed the earth, and &s;aid, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked I now return to thee, thou common mother of mankind." From Laredo he proceeded to Valladolid. There he took a la&s;t and ten|der leave of his two &s;i&s;ters; whom he would not permit to accompany him to his &s;olitude, though they entreated it with tears; not only that they might have the con&s;ola|tion of contributing, by their attendance and care, to mitigate or to &s;ooth his &s;ufferings, but that they might reap in&s;truction and benefit, by joining with him in tho&s;e pi|ous exerci&s;es, to which he had con&s;ecrated the remainder of his days.</P>
<P>From Valladolid, he continued his journey to Plazen|cia in E&s;tremadura. He had pa&s;&s;ed through that city a great many years before; and having been &s;truck at that time with the delightful &s;ituation of the mona&s;tery of St. Ju&s;tus, belonging to the order of St. Jerome, not many miles di&s;tant from that place, he had then ob&s;erved to &s;ome of his attendants, that this was a &s;pot to which Diocle&s;ian might have retired with plea&s;ure. The im|pre&s;&s;ion had remained &s;o &s;trong on his mind, that he pitch|ed
<PB N="282" REF="038017_0282_1010D6430E1FFF50">
upon it as the place of his retreat. It was &s;eated in a vale of no great extent, watered by a &s;mall brook, and &s;urrounded by ri&s;ing grounds, covered with lofty trees: from the nature of the &s;oil, as well as the temperature of the climate, it was e&s;teemed the mo&s;t healthful and de|licious &s;ituation in Spain. Some months before his re|&s;ignation, he had &s;ent an architect thither, to add a new apartment to the mona&s;tery, for his accommodation; but he gave &s;trict orders, that the &s;tyle of the building &s;hould be &s;uch as &s;uited his pre&s;ent &s;tation, rather than his for|mer dignity. It con&s;i&s;ted only of &s;ix rooms, four of them in the form of friars' cells, with naked walls; the other two, each twenty feet &s;quare, were hung with brown cloth and furni&s;hed in the mo&s;t &s;imple manner. They were all on a level with the ground; with a door on one &s;ide into a garden, of which Charles him&s;elf had given the plan, and had filled it with various plants, which he pro|po&s;ed to cultivate with his own hands. On the other &s;ide, they communicated with the chapel of the mona&s;|tery, in which he was to perform his devotions. Into this humble retreat, hardly &s;ufficient for the comfortable accommodation of a private gentleman, did Charles en|ter, with twelve dome&s;tics only. He buried there, in &s;o|litude and &s;ilence, his grandeur, his ambition, together with all tho&s;e va&s;t projects, which, during half a century, had alarmed and agitated Europe; filling every kingdom in it, by turns, with the terror of his arms, and the dread of being &s;ubjected to his power.</P>
<P>In this retirement Charles formed &s;uch a plan of life for him&s;elf, as would have &s;uited the condition of a pri|vate
<PB N="283" REF="038017_0283_1010D644E40655F8">
per&s;on of a moderate fortune. His table was neat but plain; his dome&s;tics few; his intercour&s;e with them fa|miliar; all the cumber&s;ome and ceremonious forms of attendance on his per&s;on were entirely aboli&s;hed, as de|&s;tructive of that &s;ocial ea&s;e and tranquility, which he courted, in order to &s;ooth the remainder of his days. As the mildne&s;s of the climate, together with his deliverance from the burdens and cares of government, procured him, at fir&s;t, a con&s;iderable remi&s;&s;ion from the acute pains with which he had been long tormented, he enjoyed, per|haps, more complete &s;atisfaction in this humble &s;olitude, than all his grandeur had ever yielded him. The am|bitious thoughts and projects, which had &s;o long engro&s;&s;|ed and di&s;quieted him, were quite effaced from his mind. Far from taking any part in the political tran&s;actions of the princes of Europe, he re&s;trained his curio&s;ity even from any inquiry concerning them; and he &s;eemed to view the bu&s;y &s;cene which he had abandoned, with all the contempt and indifference ari&s;ing from his thorough experience of its vanity, as well as from the plea&s;ing re|flection of having di&s;entangled him&s;elf from its cares.</P>

Three objects are propo&s;ed by Mr. Murray, in giving this volume to the world: fir&s;t, to improve youth in the indi&s;pen&s;able art of reading; &s;econdly, to meliorate their language and &s;entiments; and thirdly, to inculcate &s;ome of the mo&s;t important principles of piety and virtue.&mdash;The articles &s;elected for the fir&s;t of the&s;e purpo&s;es, are peculiarly calculated for exerci&s;ing the various pau&s;es, inflections, and modulations of the voice; they are judici|ou&s;ly diver&s;ified and proportioned, and accurately punctua|ted&mdash;In pur&s;uance of his &s;econd object, Mr. Murray has made his &s;elections from the mo&s;t correct and elegant writers; and purity, propriety, and per&s;picuity, of cour&s;e, character|ize them.&mdash;In his third department, we find extracts &s;trong|ly tending to promote piety and virtue. They place religion in the mo&s;t amiable light; and recommend the moral duties<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by proving the excellence of their nature, and the happy effects which they produce. In no part of the work do we meet with an expre&s;&s;ion that might gratify a corrupt, or viti|ate a pure mind; nor a &s;entiment that can offend the ear of innocence. The Peru&s;al of the Sacred Scriptures is pow|erfully recommended, by the frequent in&s;ertion of the mo&s;t &s;ublime, beautiful, and intere&s;ting pa&s;&s;ages of the&s;e invalua|ble writings. But though the general ca&s;t of the volume partakes more of the grave than the gay, yet is it not with|out a con&s;iderable portion of rational amu&s;ement: and as it is &s;erious without enthu&s;ia&s;m or &s;uper&s;tition, &s;o is it cheerful

without levity&mdash;We do not fear di&s;crediting our judgment, by recommending to all &s;ects and degrees of people this por|table volume; which though profe&s;&s;edly compiled for the in&s;truction of youth, will not be found unu&s;eful to per&s;ons of riper years."</P>
<BIBL><HI>New London Review, July,</HI> 1799.</BIBL>
<P>"This &s;election reflects much credit on the ta&s;te of the compiler; and the arrangement of the various pieces is judicious. The different authors, from whom the&s;e extracts are taken, enforce virtue by the graces of their compo&s;ition. The preliminary rules for enunciation are u&s;eful, and clear|ly delivered. We therefore recommend this &s;mall volume to tho&s;e who wi&s;h to attain, without the help of in&s;tructors, the important advantages of thinking and &s;peaking with propriety.</P>

The &s;e|lection is made with judgment; the pieces are &s;uch as may be recommended to the peru&s;al of youth; they are extracted from the works of the mo&s;t correct and elegant writers, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their purity, propriety, per&s;pecuity, and in many in&s;tances elegance of diction. With the many per|formances of the like kind which have been pre&s;ented to the public, the pre&s;ent will not &s;uffer in any re&s;pect by a com|pari&s;on.</P>
