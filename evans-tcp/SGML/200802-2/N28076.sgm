<P>THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL BE IN EVER|LASTING REMEMBRANCE.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is no pa&s;&s;ion more deeply and univer&s;ally implanted in human nature, than that of tran&s;mitting our names to po&s;terity, and living, though dead, in the affections of the wi&s;e and the virtuous. And great is the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God in thus con&s;tituting &s;uch beings as we are; for this principle acts as a &s;pur and a mo&s;t powerful motive to great and generous actions. It keeps all the wheels of &s;ociety in perpe|tual motion, pre&s;&s;ing millions of intelligent crea|tures forward, and con&s;tantly &s;oliciting them to attend to their various duties, and to excel in their &s;everal profe&s;&s;ions. It is &s;o clo&s;ely interwo|ven
<PB N="4" REF="037425_0003_100D2F4DB847FD50">
with the love of our being, that it proves the &s;ource of our noble&s;t plea&s;ures and of our keen|e&s;t pains. But, like all other pa&s;&s;ions, it has &s;ometimes been perverted, and its influence di&s;|regarded. Characters have appeared &s;o extremely degraded, and &s;o totally lo&s;t to every thing prai&s;e|worthy, as to prefer, if we may judge of their feel|ings from their behaviour, an <HI>infamous</HI> to an <HI>honourable</HI> di&s;tinction. But, however depraved human nature may be in the opinion of &s;ome, to excel in wickedne&s;s, and with the view of being tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity as &s;ingularly profligate, has not been the ambition of many. Few have appeared &s;o &s;tupidly in&s;en&s;ible to the judgment of the public, as not to be moved, either by its prai&s;es, or cen&s;ures. It is the wi&s;h of the pea&s;ant, as well as the de&s;ire of tho&s;e who "devi&s;e liberal things," and who "by liberal things &s;hall &s;tand," to have a name and a place among the living, though numbered with the dead. And although many of the riche&s;t charities, and the mo&s;t beau|tiful monuments of piety, have originated from the pure&s;t principles of chri&s;tian love; yet, &s;hall we be charged with ingratitude and want of can|dour,
<PB N="5" REF="037425_0004_100D408463D654E8">
when we &s;ugge&s;t, that others, equally orna|mental and beneficial to &s;ociety, have ari&s;en from the natural and plea&s;ing expectation of being re|membered <HI>here,</HI> as well as rewarded <HI>hereafter?</HI></P>
<P>To this grand &s;ource of life and enterpri&s;e we are indebted for mo&s;t of the conveniences and ele|gances of life, and for many of the mo&s;t u&s;eful and &s;hining characters that have appeared in the world. The &s;tate&s;man, the &s;age, the hero, and even the holy man of God, have experienced its efficacy. Indeed, this love of pre-eminence, this vying with each other in the race of perfection, has unfolded the mo&s;t brilliant talents, and matur|ed the &s;ublime&s;t virtues. It has frequently checked the career of the wicked, when nothing el&s;e could have done it, and made tho&s;e, who would otherwi&s;e have been the &s;evere&s;t &s;courges, the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial ble&s;&s;ings to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>But, if this principle be &s;o very powerful and beneficial, as it re&s;pects things <HI>temporal,</HI> how much more efficacious mu&s;t it be, when it embraces things <HI>&s;piritual and eternal!</HI> We &s;ee that the ob|jects of all our pre&s;ent pur&s;uits are &s;hort-lived, precarious, and peri&s;hing. All the agreeable and plea&s;ing pro&s;pects laid open to us by affluence, am|bition,
<PB N="6" REF="037425_0005_100D4085EF21E718">
and &s;en&s;e, are but for a moment in com|pari&s;on with tho&s;e of eternity. If, therefore, it be a laudable de&s;ire to aim at tran&s;mitting our me|mories to po&s;terity with honour, (and certainly it is,) it mu&s;t be infinitely more worthy of our mo&s;t &s;trenuous exertions, to &s;ecure a title to tho&s;e things, which "eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man;&mdash;the things which God hath prepared for them that love him."</P>
<P>But it is not certain, that this future reward of the righteous, however familiar the doctrine may be to us, is the reward promi&s;ed in our text. For, as the promi&s;es annexed to a virtuous life in the Old Te&s;tament are chiefly, if not wholly, temporal, it is more than probable, that the P&s;almi&s;t did not extend his views &s;o far, but that they were confined to the pre&s;ent life only. However, as he &s;aw that the character of a righteous man was &s;o worthy and truly re|&s;pectable, as to command the e&s;teem and reve|rence of all around him, by "everla&s;ting re|membrance," he undoubtedly intended the mo&s;t honourable and permanent rewards, of which he had any conception.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037425_0006_100D408795A16E08">By the "righteous," the &s;criptures often mean no more than a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> man; one, who is &s;crupu|lou&s;ly exact; who gives to every man his ju&s;t weight and mea&s;ure; and who pays the mo&s;t religious re&s;pect to all his engagements. But the character before us is much more lovely and excellent; it is that, which may emphatically be called the GOOD MAN. In the ver&s;e immediately preceding the text we read, "A good man &s;hew|eth favour, and lendeth; he will guide his affairs with di&s;cretion. Surely he &s;hall not be moved forever." "The righteous," it follows, "&s;hall be in everla&s;ting remembrance." The gratitude of individuals, and the applau&s;e of the public, &s;hall tran&s;mit the name and the merits of the per&s;on endowed with this mo&s;t "excellent &s;pirit" to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>There is a great difference between the&s;e two characters, the <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and the <HI>good</HI> man, though they are often con&s;idered as the &s;ame. The former is e&s;teemed a &s;afe and a re&s;pectable character. But what has the man fallen among thieves, &s;tripped, wounded, and lying in the highway half dead, to expect from it? Not that he will pour wine and
<PB N="8" REF="037425_0007_100D408947B57320">
oil into his wounds, &s;et him on his own bea&s;t, carry him to an inn, and &s;ee him taken care of at his own expen&s;e; for mercy is no con&s;tituent part of this character. Such a man, though ju&s;t, may be au&s;tere; as he pays, &s;o he may exact, the uttermo&s;t farthing; he may withhold his bounty, live to him&s;elf, and have no "bowels of com|pa&s;&s;ion" for his fellow creatures. But the <HI>good</HI> man is not only a righteous man and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all his merits, however re&s;pectable they may be, but of many more, even an a&s;&s;emblage of all the mo&s;t generous and amiable virtues.</P>
<P>But, to return to the rewards of the righteous. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, through whom "life and immor|tality are brought to light," has given all his faith|ful followers the fulle&s;t a&s;&s;urances, that they &s;hall live forever; not only in the remembrance of their fellow creatures, but in the e&s;teem of all the holy angels, and even in the friend&s;hip of God him&s;elf, by who&s;e example and moral perfections they have formed their tempers. This is an "everla&s;ting remembrance" indeed, beyond which, as it includes everla&s;ting happine&s;s, we cannot extend our de&s;ires.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037425_0008_100D408B603D8658">And to animate us all to a&s;pire after the&s;e highe&s;t and unfading honours, though as &s;ocial creatures we cannot wholly &s;u&s;pend our de&s;ires after others, I &s;hall lay before you the character of the righteous, or good man; on whom they will all, eventually, be publicly and &s;olemnly be&s;towed.</P>
<P>And here we may ob&s;erve, that the fir&s;t and great object of a good man's attention, is the glory of God, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his king|dom in the hearts of men. Convinced of the in|timate connexion between vice and mi&s;ery, and of the beneficial effects of virtue in families, in &s;tates, and in the whole conduct of human life; he con&s;iders it as his indi&s;pen&s;able duty, and as the greate&s;t benefit he can po&s;&s;ibly confer on his fellow creatures, to encourage and extend its influence among all orders and ranks of men. Every favourable opportunity he &s;tands ready, and is mo&s;t heartily di&s;po&s;ed, to embrace, to promote the love and practice of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. His de&s;ire is, to enrich the minds of all his neighbours and acquaintance with the pure&s;t principles of love to God and benevolence
<PB N="10" REF="037425_0009_100D408E52D9F550">
to man, and to engage their hearts in the pur&s;uit of every virtue. His time and his talents are all employed in doing good, and all the good he can. Thus he co-operates with the di&s;pen&s;ations of Divine Providence, and conforms to the example of God him&s;elf, who has done every thing, con|&s;i&s;tent with the freedom of moral agents, to arre&s;t the progre&s;s of vice and wickedne&s;s; to bani&s;h &s;in and mi&s;ery from the world; and to e&s;tabli&s;h a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace and joy upon their ruins. And, by a careful cultivation of this heavenly temper, he goes on "from &s;trength to &s;trength," until he arrives at perfection; when virtue becomes familiar, and its practice ea&s;y. And here we may ob&s;erve, that, although the heart of the good man is thus con&s;ecrated to God, and to the &s;ervice of his fellow creatures, we di&s;cover no &s;ymptoms of that ra&s;h and intemperate zeal by which &s;ome have been guided, and which would annihilate the rights of con&s;cience, and &s;tifle the tendere&s;t charities of the go&s;pel. For, although fixed in his faith and mode of wor&s;hip, and im|moveable in his &s;entiments of religion, he con|&s;iders the right of private judgment as &s;acred and
<PB N="11" REF="037425_0010_100D409012087480">
unalienable; and, both by his precepts and exam|ple, di&s;covers his entire di&s;approbation of all tho&s;e unfriendly and mi&s;taken principles, which limit the grace of God, in favour of the cho&s;en few, to the exclu&s;ion of numerous &s;ects and parties. With Saint Peter he perceives, "that God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons; but, in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, is accept|ed with him." His love, therefore, abounds to|wards his fellow creatures, until it overcomes the force of all "idle and nominal di&s;tinctions" what|ever. The man of an upright life, and who&s;e conver&s;ation is agreeable to the grace of God in the go&s;pel, is cheerfully admitted to all the privi|leges of a chri&s;tian brother. It matters not where he was born, how he was educated, nor in what form and mode he wor&s;hips God; for &s;uch is the effect of chri&s;tian charity, that it withholds its affections from no &s;ect nor nation, and from no individual, who&s;e life and conver&s;ation are agree|able to the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Another branch of this great and excellent cha|racter is, firmne&s;s of mind, fortitude &s;uperior to the mo&s;t flattering pro&s;pects, and to the mo&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="037425_0011_100D4092596236F8">
powerful oppo&s;itions, and which can &s;upport it&s;elf, in the pur&s;uit and execution of all wi&s;e and righ|teous mea&s;ures, again&s;t the imprudent &s;olicitations of friends, the in&s;idious arts of hypocri&s;y, and even the menaces of tyranny. No change of times, of fortune, or of men, can prevail over his integrity, or lead him to give up his &s;entiments, and to de|viate from what he conceives to be the line of his duty. In none of his views is he governed either by the prai&s;es or cen&s;ures of the public opinion; and therefore he is always di&s;po&s;ed to adopt tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which from a cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate ex|amination, he is fully convinced are prudent, ju&s;t, and ultimately beneficial. He will not be di&s;|couraged by the venality of tho&s;e, who have not the re&s;olution to countenance and approve of his virtuous exertions for fear of di&s;grace, and who dare not contradict the general opinion, however apparently mi&s;taken, and prejudicial to the public welfare. He can read di&s;approbation in the faces of individuals, and meet the frowns of a mi&s;|guided multitude, with a countenance undi&s;may|ed, and an heart that fears no evil. The te&s;ti|mony of a good con&s;cience, accompanied with
<PB N="13" REF="037425_0012_100D409651E0C840">
the hopes of futurity, is more than a compen&s;a|tion for all the&s;e terrors. Not that he pays no deference to the judgment of others, and is in&s;en|&s;ible to public e&s;teem; but that he is re&s;olved to prefer his duty to all other con&s;iderations; and that he never will embrace and recommend a mea|&s;ure repugnant to his rea&s;on and con&s;cience, not even for a moment, for all the mo&s;t flattering pro&s;|pects of riches and power.</P>
<P>Again: A good man, however exten&s;ive his me|rits, will be cautious how he mentions them. Knowing the imperfections of our common nature, though favoured with all the &s;uperior advantages of birth, titles and fortune, and placed in the mo&s;t elevated &s;tations of life, he cannot "glory;"&mdash;can neither in&s;ult nor triumph over the mi&s;takes and errors of his brethren. And if he is obliged to cen&s;ure their ignorance and follies, it will be with compa&s;&s;ion, and not with &s;everity. However ex|cellent his abilities and accompli&s;hments may be, he can di&s;cover the merits of tho&s;e, who move in more humble &s;tations, and can "conde&s;cend to men of low e&s;tate." He leaves it to others to e&s;ti|mate his worth, and to proportion the mea&s;ure of
<PB N="14" REF="037425_0013_100D4097E1F0CC08">
his fame. As he would not give pain, he avoids breaking in upon the claims of others, and pre|fers none in his own behalf. Without any de|gree of re&s;entment he can bear with ingratitude it&s;elf, when appreciating his merits, and pardon the man, who endeavours to le&s;&s;en his glory. Self-preference has &s;o little influence upon a mind thus elevated, that it can look down upon the mul|titude contending for perfection, with the highe&s;t degree of complacency. When he beholds a genuine virtue, no matter how humble the mind and condition in which it was matured, he can &s;elect it for his own imitation, and, without pride or envy, acknowledge the merits, and prai&s;e the efforts, of all who endeavour to equal or &s;ur|pa&s;s him in reputation. The mo&s;t lavi&s;h en|comiums be&s;towed on the <HI>real</HI> de&s;erts of others betray in him no &s;ymptoms of re&s;entment. The piety and candour of his heart are &s;o generous and pure, that he can "rejoice with them that do rejoice," and give "honour to whom honour is due." And without any invidious compari&s;ons he is di&s;po&s;ed mo&s;t humbly to acknowledge, that "promotion cometh neither from the ea&s;t, nor
<PB N="15" REF="037425_0014_100D409AB8248348">
from the we&s;t, nor from the &s;outh;" but that "God is the judge; he putteth down one and &s;etteth up another."</P>
<P>Further: The good man is &s;trongly oppo&s;ed to every kind of di&s;&s;imulation. He knoweth not how to flatter. In no part of his behaviour can we di&s;cover &s;o much as the &s;hadow of duplicity. The example of the "double minded" man &s;trikes his righteous &s;oul with abhorrence. And indeed, take it "all in all," it is one of the mo&s;t contemptible, if not one of the mo&s;t dangerous, characters in &s;ociety. The good man's faith, piety, and morals, are all &s;incere. The affec|tions of his heart, whence every thing belonging to true religion derives its value, are all pure and undefiled. Convinced that neither rites nor ceremonies, nor yet all the externals of piety, can be accepted of God as a &s;ub&s;titute for that righteou&s;ne&s;s, which he requires, he con&s;iders all the duties of religion as de&s;igned to promote moral rectitude;&mdash;to enrich our hearts with the &s;ublime&s;t virtues;&mdash;and that nothing which does not contribute to this mo&s;t excellent end is worth contending for; and therefore all his claims to
<PB N="16" REF="037425_0015_100D409CEB793238">
the character of a chri&s;tian are built upon that faith in Chri&s;t which is unfeigned, and "which worketh by love." And this &s;ame open and libe|ral principle prevails in all his tran&s;actions with mankind. He is a &s;tranger to tho&s;e pitiful &s;hifts, to which even the mo&s;t &s;ubtle hypocrite is &s;ometimes obliged to have recour&s;e, in order to ju&s;tify or apologize for his conduct. When &s;elf-intere&s;t is the prevailing principle in a man, and that to which all others give place, there is no cal|culating upon the deceptions and mi&s;chiefs to which the incautious are expo&s;ed in all their commerce and connexions with him. The kind|e&s;t expre&s;&s;ions, the &s;tronge&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of friend|&s;hip, and the mo&s;t flattering expectations, are all in their favour. But the&s;e are &s;oon forgotten, and nothing can be realized, but &s;hame and mor|tification. But as the good man has no intere&s;ts unconnected with the intere&s;ts of others, and which may not fairly and openly be promoted, he can have no temptation, either to di&s;&s;emble or flatter. If he profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf your friend, his profe&s;&s;ion will prove &s;acred and inviolable. You will find him an "I&s;raelite indeed," and &s;hall
<PB N="17" REF="037425_0016_100D409E96E5D100">
never &s;uffer through a mi&s;placed confidence. Let his &s;tation and office be what they may, he will "keep the faith," and hold fa&s;t his integrity till he dies.</P>
<P>Again: The good man endeavours to be perfect, or merciful, as his "Father which is in heaven is perfect." This is a duty of &s;o delightful a nature, and accompanied with &s;o many &s;weet fruits in the performance of it, that one would imagine no|thing need be &s;aid to enforce the practice of it. However, we may ob&s;erve, that the common happine&s;s of our fellow creatures is by no means a common concern. Thou&s;ands are &s;o lo&s;t to this godlike propen&s;ity, as to live to them&s;elves only: they di&s;cover no &s;entiments of pity and compa&s;&s;ion, and do not appear to have any inte|re&s;t in the general welfare of mankind. They never reflect upon the &s;ufferings of tho&s;e, who have long &s;truggled with the calamities of life, and who are ready to &s;ink under the weight of their burdens; and therefore they have no wine and no oil for their con&s;olation. And yet we can have no doubts, when we attend to "the words of our Lord Je&s;us," who &s;ays, "It is more ble&s;&s;ed to
<PB N="18" REF="037425_0017_100D40A265C5B550">
give than to receive;" whether he who delights in acts of mercy, and performs them from the pure&s;t motives, or he who receives the benefits which flow from this heavenly temper, enjoys the greate&s;t happine&s;s. But, however influenced by the&s;e intere&s;ting &s;en&s;ations&mdash;the&s;e tender vibra|tions of a good heart&mdash;the merciful man may be, (and no doubt they are the &s;tronge&s;t propen|&s;ities of our nature,) yet the &s;tate of &s;ociety, and the duties of his office, may &s;ometimes be &s;uch, as to compel him to cut off tho&s;e who are oppo&s;ed to the common &s;afety and happine&s;s; but not without bringing home to his own heart a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of their &s;ufferings. Such is the force of this principle, that he is always di&s;po&s;ed, when it can be done without injury to others, to pity, to &s;pare, and to &s;ave, even the evil and unthankful. He con&s;iders the frailty and weakne&s;s of human nature, and knows that we all &s;tand in need of favourable allowances and interpo&s;itions of mercy. For, however fortunate and independent, no man can &s;ay to his brother, any more than the hand can &s;ay to the foot, "I have no need of thee." As the indulgence of each cruel and malevolent pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="19" REF="037425_0018_100D40A5552285C0">
increa&s;es the mea&s;ure of human mi&s;ery, &s;o the ef|fu&s;ions of mercy and compa&s;&s;ion le&s;&s;en the weight of our &s;ufferings. And be&s;ides, the good man perceives, that the habit and practice of the&s;e precious virtues perfect our nature, and make us like God.</P>
<P>Finally: The good man has the &s;incere&s;t affec|tion for his country, and thinks no &s;acrifice that he can offer too great for the promotion of its pro&s;perity and glory. He &s;ees that all are not qualified for places of confidence and di&s;tinction, and that his happine&s;s does not depend &s;o much on the &s;tation in which Providence has placed him, as on a proper improvement of the talents committed to his care. If, therefore, he is poor, he will be an example of indu&s;try and economy; and if rich, of &s;obriety and charity. In&s;tead of coveting the abundance, or envying the merits, of tho&s;e whom fortune and the public e&s;teem have rendered more con&s;picuous than him&s;elf, he will "&s;tudy to be quiet, and to do his own bu&s;ine&s;s." He knows it to be his duty, his intere&s;t, and his honour, &s;o long as he enjoys the benefit of "mild and equal laws," and is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the rights
<PB N="20" REF="037425_0019_100D40A6F65CEA78">
of man, to guard and protect the fountain from whence they flow. He feels the worth and influ|ence of a good reputation in him&s;elf too much to lead him to "&s;peak evil of dignities," or to li&s;ten to the calumnies of tho&s;e who do. When he meets tho&s;e who are not a&s;hamed to glory in their vices, and to oppo&s;e the righteous and tho&s;e who are labouring to e&s;tabli&s;h the public welfare, un|daunted by their cen&s;ures, he will &s;peak, and not keep &s;ilence, but rebuke &s;harply. Neither hopes nor fears can extingui&s;h or le&s;&s;en the ardour of this glowing and patriotic principle. Even &s;uffer|ings and the deepe&s;t ingratitude cannot overcome it, for he looks upon him&s;elf as born for the good of the community; and therefore his time, his ta|lents, his ea&s;e, and even his life, &s;hould nece&s;&s;ity require the &s;acrifice, he is ready to devote to the &s;afety of his country.</P>
<P>Such would be the character of the good man, as far as circum&s;tances <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">mit, even in the hum|bler walks of life; and if we admire the utility and dignity of it in the private citizen, how much more illu&s;trious and exten&s;ively u&s;eful mu&s;t it appear when clothed with the authority, and pla|ced at the head, of a great nation!</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="037425_0020_100D40A9CE8D3C28">Here we behold power and goodne&s;s united; from which union the righteous have nothing to fear, but every thing to hope. This will be evi|dent, when we attend to his wi&s;e and upright admini&s;tration. For he will "rule in the fear of God," and make it his principal object to pro|mote the intere&s;ts of his kingdom; and thereby he becomes "a terror to evil doers," as well as "a prai&s;e to them that do well." His integrity and firmne&s;s are not to be &s;haken by the voice of the multitude. Superior to all influences of friends and parties, his great and independent mind will not &s;uffer him to patroni&s;e any but the meritori|ous and tho&s;e who are worthy of public confi|dence. Amid&s;t all the intrigues and contending pa&s;&s;ions of the envious, the di&s;appointed, and am|bitious, he maintains his dignity, and increa&s;es his glory. Friends, family, dependents, and every con&s;ideration of private intere&s;t, are wholly ab|&s;orbed in the love of his country. Anxious for the happine&s;s of tho&s;e over whom he pre&s;ides, he reverences the laws, which he has engaged to &s;up|port, maintains their &s;pirit, and enforces their authority, again&s;t all oppo&s;ition. In the duties

peculiar to each branch of his public character, he is governed by rea&s;on, and not by pa&s;&s;ion; there|fore he is not ra&s;h and precipitate, but cool and deliberate, in all his mea&s;ures. In one word, in the good man, thus clothed with national autho|rity, and moving in the elevated &s;phere of its fir&s;t magi&s;trate, we behold the genuine patron of un|adulterated liberty, &s;upported by the unlimited confidence of a watchful and di&s;cerning public; vindicating the cau&s;e of the oppre&s;&s;ed, re&s;train|ing the in&s;olence of pride and the wantonne&s;s of power, and filled with the mo&s;t godlike &s;enti|ments; the friend, the guardian&punc; and the father, of his country; di&s;pen&s;ing ju&s;tice and judgment, with an equal hand, and copying the example of God him&s;elf, in his lenity, beneficence, mercy and love.</P>
<P>But you may be ready to inquire, whether &s;uch a character, merely human, has ever appeared on earth. Shall we meet with it in the annals of Athens or of Rome? In what hi&s;tory is it to be found? and in what country has it been di&s;play|ed? In an&s;wer to the&s;e anxious and very natural inquiries I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the melan|choly

<P>It is almo&s;t needle&s;s to ob&s;erve, that the &s;peak|er was led to the&s;e reflections from our common lo&s;s in the death of that truly great and good man, who, under God, effected the independence of the&s;e United States, and lately pre&s;ided at the helm of our general government; who&s;e di&s;tin|gui&s;hed talents and illu&s;trious virtues long &s;ince engaged the warme&s;t affections of this enlightened nation, and who&s;e re&s;plendent merits excited the admiration, and extorted the prai&s;e, of all Europe. And not only &s;o, but "their &s;ound went into <HI>all</HI> the earth, and unto the <HI>ends</HI> of the world."</P>
<P>When we reflect on his goodne&s;s, his piety, his firmne&s;s, wi&s;dom and prudence;&mdash;on his mode&s;ty, benevolence and candour;&mdash;on his ince&s;&s;ant exer|tions in the field of glory, his unremitting a&s;&s;iduity

in the &s;ervice of his country, and on the rich and invaluable laurels with which, under God, he crowned her, &s;hall we be charged with enthu&s;ia&s;m, when we affirm, that a more virtuous patriot, a wi&s;er &s;tate&s;man, and a greater general, than GEORGE WASHINGTON, never died. Though dead, he yet &s;peaketh;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his FAREWELL ADDRESS to his Country.</NOTE> and while either private or public gratitude remain, <HI>his</HI> name "&s;hall be in everla&s;ting remembrance."</P>
<P>And may his &s;uperior abilities, clear judgment, and illu&s;trious virtues, like the mantle of Elijah, long re&s;t upon the head of our greate&s;t living bene|factor, his worthy &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Now unto GOD, who &s;aid unto his anointed &s;er|vant, Cyrus, "He is my &s;hepherd, and &s;hall per|form all my plea&s;ure," be a&s;cribed everla&s;ting prai&s;es, through JESUS CHRIST our LORD.</P>
