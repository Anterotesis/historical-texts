<Q>RIGHTEOUSNESS EXALTETH A NATION.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is no principle of human na|ture that is, in a general way, more powerful than a principle of honor. When a man apprehends his honor at &s;take, he will readily ri&s;que every thing that is dear to him&s;elf to defend it; and will even &s;acrifice his life in the cau&s;e. This is, mo&s;t commonly, at the bottom of all the wars, commotions, and blood&s;hed, that are at any time in the world. In the &s;upport and defence of this, thou&s;ands have bled and are &s;till bleeding. To a&s;&s;ert and maintain, to &s;up|port and defend the pretended honor and dignity
<PB N="6" REF="043429_0004_101CED71DECDC9B8">of the crown of Great-Britain, they have already expended millions, and have hazarded the lives of thou&s;ands; yea, thou&s;ands and thou&s;ands have already fallen in the field of battle; and they have &s;pread de&s;olation, ruin and di&s;tre&s;s among&s;t numbers of the innocent inhabitants of America. If we enquire, how it can be po&s;&s;ible that a nation can be &s;o void of natural affection, and can conduct as tho' they were de&s;titute of all feelings towards their fellow creatures and their brethren according to the fle&s;h, be&s;ides tho&s;e of malice and rancour; we &s;hall find that it is a principle of honor that continually impels then, that it is a principle of honor that overpowers every other affection of the mind, and hurries them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> such acts of outrage, cruelty and vengeance. Surely we might be ready to think that if a principle of honor will produce &s;uch bitter fruits as the&s;e,&mdash;it is will overpower the principles of compa&s;&s;ion and benevolence in mankind towards their fellow creatures, and event tho&s;e of their own kindred; that if a prin|ciple of honor will operate in this manner, it is an evil and pernicious principle.</P>
<P>BUT mankind are mo&s;t evidently actuated by a fal&s;e principle of honor, in pur&s;uing &s;uch a line of conduct. What they aim at as their honor, is indeed their greate&s;t reprouch, and ter|minates in their burning &s;hame. A principle of true honor is a mo&s;t excellent principle&mdash;
<PB N="7" REF="043429_0005_101CED75B7034850">It is truly laudable and well plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of God. When a per&s;on or a people are ambitious of that wherein their true honor con|&s;i&s;ts, they are then engaged in a mo&s;t laudable and excellent pur&s;uit. So it is pointed out by the ob&s;ervation of the wi&s;e man in our text, <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation.</HI> He meant, mo&s;t &s;urely, to mention this as a powerful motive to exite a people to follow after righteou&s;ne&s;s. It is as tho' he had &s;aid, What nation or people are ambitious of true honor? let them &s;eek after righteou&s;ne&s;s, and this will be a dignity and an honor unto them.</P>
<P>AND now to trace the de&s;ign of the&s;e words, and to improve them in a manner &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion before us, I would here endeavor by the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance,</P>
<P N="1">I. To &s;hew what the wi&s;e man means by that righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a nation.</P>
<P N="2">II. POINT out the rea&s;ons why this righte|ou&s;ne&s;s will exalt a nation.</P>
<P N="3">III. CONCLUDE with tho&s;e addre&s;&s;es that will naturally ari&s;e out of my &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">I. I AM to &s;hew what the wi&s;e man means by that righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a na|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="043429_0006_101CED7DE8E8BF70">WHEN the wi&s;e man &s;peaks of righteou&s;ne&s;s exalting a nation, he has a mo&s;t evident refe|rence to the general character of that people of which the nation con&s;i&s;ts. That righteou&s;ne&s;s may exalt a nation, the generality of the people of which the nation con&s;i&s;ts mu&s;t be vi&s;ibly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it; &s;o that it may be &s;aid of &s;uch a nation, that it is a righteous nation, a nation that loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;eeketh after it. This is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ary, in order that righteou&s;ne&s;s may exalt a nation. Righteou&s;ne&s;s mu&s;t form their general character. It will be of no avail to any &s;uch a purpo&s;e for many individuals among a nation or people to pur&s;ue after righteou&s;ne&s;s, whil&s;t the nation in general, and the people at large do vi&s;ibly give a loo&s;e to &s;in, and iniquity reigns triumphant among&s;t them. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, altho' as to individuals there may be <HI>&s;even thou&s;and</HI> among&s;t that peo|ple that <HI>have not bowed the know to the image of Baal,</HI> yet as a people they are de&s;titute of that righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and are <HI>a &s;inful people, a people ladem with iniquity.</HI> And now that righteou&s;ne&s; which exalteth a nation, taken in this view of it, implies</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT the people, as &s;uch, do pay a &s;acred regard to the wor&s;hip and ordinances of God.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="043429_0007_101CED7F6C1C5FA8">THIS is one e&s;&s;ential token and te&s;t of a people's being God's vi&s;ible people. It is &s;uch an e&s;&s;ential te&s;t and token of it, that without it a people cannot be &s;aid to be God's vi&s;ible people. When it once comes to this among a people that they openly for&s;ake the wor&s;hip and ordinances of God, they do then openly ca&s;t off the badge of their being his vi&s;ible people; they openly renouce their vi&s;ible relation to him as their God, and declare, as in open language that they <HI>will not have him to reign over them.</HI> When God in&s;tituted his wo&s;hip to be ob&s;erved by his people, he in&s;tituted it as a &s;ign and token that his people were vi&s;ibly his, that he was their king and lord, and that they were his &s;ubjects and &s;ervants. So it is expre&s;&s;ed in Exod. 31.16, 17. <HI>Wherefore the children of I&s;rael &s;hall keep the &s;abbath, to ob&s;erve the &s;abbath thro' out their generation for a perpetual covenant. It is a &s;ign between me and the children of I&s;rael forever.</HI> This was the de&s;ign of the in&s;titution of the &s;abbath. It was to be a &s;ign between God and his people; a token and pledge that they were his vi&s;ible people; that he was their &s;u|preme King and Lord, and that no other lords be&s;ides him had the dominion over them. And now if this is what is enjoined upon a people by the ordinance and appointment of God as an e&s;&s;ential taken and pledge of their being his vi&s;ible people; then &s;urely it is e&s;&s;ential that a people do &s;acredly ob&s;erve the wor&s;hip and
<PB N="10" REF="043429_0008_101CED813B364F58">ordinances of God, in order that they may be vi&s;ibly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that righteous&s;ne&s;s which ex|alteth a nation.</P>
<P>IT is evident from the very light of nature, that the wor&s;hip of God is a duty of &s;acred importance. Hence the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves con|cerning the very heathens, that <HI>becau&s;e they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, and neither would wor&s;hip and glorify him as God; but turned the glory of the incorruptable God into an image made like unto corruptable man, and &s;erved the creature more than the Creator, who is God over all ble&s;&s;ed forever</HI>;&mdash;that <HI>for this cau&s;e God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do tho&s;e things which are not convenient.</HI> Which evidently implies that the very light of nature laid the heathens under &s;acred obligations, to ob&s;erve the wor&s;hip of God. They were vi&s;ited with the mo&s;t awful judgments, becau&s;e they did not wor&s;hip and glorify God as God. But &s;urely they were never puni&s;hed by a righteous God for violating tho&s;e obligations they were not under. Fora&s;much then as they were pu|ni&s;hed in &s;uch an awful manner as to be given up of God to a reprobate mind, becau&s;e they did not wor&s;hip and glorify him as God, it is a full demon&s;tration that they were under mo&s;t &s;acred obligations to ob&s;erve the wor&s;hip of God, and to glorify him as God. And now &s;urely if tho&s;e that had no other than the light of
<PB N="11" REF="043429_0009_101CED848F5811F0">nature were under &s;uch &s;acred and inviolable obligations to wor&s;hip and glorify God, as that their wilful neglect of this did provoke God to give them over to a reprobate mind; much more is that people under the mo&s;t &s;acred obli|gations to this, to whom God has made known has will by <HI>&s;hewing them his judgements, and giving them his &s;tatutes.</HI> God has enjoined upon his people in his word, by all that is &s;olemn and &s;acred, as a duty of the highe&s;t importance, <HI>that they &s;hould have no other God before him.</HI> This is the fir&s;t law of his kingdom. And this command does, by clear implication, carry in it, a mo&s;t &s;acred injunction to ob&s;erve the wor&s;hip of God, and to pay our homage unto him according to his in&s;titution and appoint|ment. When the will of God is &s;o clearly made known unto us in reference to this mat|ter, that people do &s;urely bring the mo&s;t awful guilt upon them&s;elves who neglect the wor&s;hip of God, and who do openly refu&s;e to glorify him as God. The wor&s;hip of God is an open practical acknowledgement that he is our only &s;upreme lord and King; and of con&s;equence for a people to refu&s;e to wor&s;hip and glorify him as their only &s;upreme lord and king, is an open renunciation of their allegiance unto him; it is an open declaration that they will not be in &s;ubjection to him, and <HI>will not have him to reign over them.</HI> Under this view of the matter, we need not wonder that God &s;hould declare him|&s;elf
<PB N="12" REF="043429_0010_101CED8629083620">&s;o awfully di&s;plea&s;ed with his people of old, whenever they for&s;ook his ordinances, and turned their backs upon his wor&s;hip. This is ever mentioned by God as an iniquity of the deepe&s;t dye; and for this he ever manife&s;ted his and anger again&s;t his people in a &s;eries of the mo&s;t awful judgments. And hence, whenever a pious king came upon the throne of I&s;rael, and &s;et him&s;elf to bring on a reformation among the people, his fir&s;t care was always exerci&s;ed in rectifying the abu&s;es of God's wor&s;hip. Never was there a reformation bro't about among&s;t that people where this one thing was neglected. 'And in proportion as a reformation ever takes place among any people in any age of the world; and to the &s;ame degree as true religion does vi&s;ibly prevail among them, it will be &s;een in that people's paying a &s;acred regard to the wor&s;hip of God.</P>
<P>WE are under the &s;ame obligations to the wor&s;hip of God as the children of I&s;rael were. For the grand rea&s;on why they were under &s;uch obligations was becau&s;e <HI>God was their God and redeemer.</HI> And if he is <HI>our God and redeemer,</HI> we are under the &s;ame obligations to wor&s;hip and glorify him as God; and our for&s;aking his wor&s;hip will be equally odious in his &s;ight. If we do, in this manner, di&s;own and renounce our vi&s;ible relation to God; he will di&s;own and renounce his vi&s;ible relation to us as his peo|ple;
<PB N="13" REF="043429_0011_101CED8F2440EA10">and as he has done to his people of old, to the &s;even churches of A&s;ia, and to all that ea&s;tern world where chri&s;tianity once flouri&s;hed in its glory; &s;o will he do unto us, by vi&s;iting us with one judgment upon the back of ano|ther, until he has ca&s;t us off from being his people.</P>
<P>I proceed to add,</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT that righteous&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a nation implies that a people do &s;et them&s;elves to di&s;|countenance and bear down all fraud and op|pre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Every degree of fraud and oppre&s;|&s;ion among men is an abomination unto the Lord; becau&s;e it is a mo&s;t flagrant violation of tho&s;e obligations mankind are ever under to each other. Mankind are under the mo&s;t &s;a|cred obligations to conduct towards one another under the influence of a temper of univer&s;al love and benevolence, by <HI>doing to others as they would that others &s;hould do unto them. This is the law and the prophets.</HI> It is what the law en|joins, and the prophets have con&s;tantly taught. And there is no way in which mankind can be guilty of more flagrant and daring violations of this command and injunction than by acts of fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion. And hence, when fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion become general among a people, It is mo&s;t evident that that people are de&s;ti|tute of that righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a na|tion.
<PB N="14" REF="043429_0012_101CED90B982DAC8">The character that evidently belongs to &s;uch a people, is that of <HI>a &s;inful people, a peo|ple laden with iniquity.</HI> And hence, if a people would be characteri&s;ed a righteous people; it is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity that they &s;et them&s;elves to di&s;countenance and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar down all fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion among them.</P>
<P>Now this implies,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT &s;uch a people are always regulated and governed by a &s;y&s;tem of laws that are found|ed in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT implies that the legi&s;lative rulers among them are them&s;elves careful to frame &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of laws as are in their nature calculated to di&s;countenance and prevent all unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s, fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion among a people. For this purpo&s;e it is always a matter of the mo&s;t &s;acred importance that the rulers of a people be <HI>ju&s;t men, that fear God and hate co|vetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> For if they that rule a people be men that love the plea&s;ures of &s;in or the wa|ges of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, it will be in vain to expect that they will make it their aim to e|&s;tabli&s;h a &s;y&s;tem of laws to di&s;countenance ini|quity, and bear down vice and oppre&s;&s;ion. The &s;tate of that people will immediately repre&s;ent that &s;poken of by the wi&s;e man, Eccl. 3.16. <HI>Moreover I &s;aw under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the place of judg|ment,
<PB N="15" REF="043429_0013_101CED926FE73AB8">
that wickedne&s;s was there; and the place of righteou&s;ne&s;s, that iniquity was there.</HI> For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they that are appointed to rule among a people are &s;uch men as have no fear of God before their eyes; they will be &s;o far from di&s;countenancing iniquity and oppre&s;&s;ion among a people, that they them&s;elves will practice op|pre&s;&s;ion, and openly countenance it by their conducted as the wi&s;e man round upon his own ob&s;ervation, as it is ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed in Eccl. 4.1. <HI>So I returned and con&s;idered all the oppre&s;&s;ions that are under the &s;un; behold the tears of &s;uch as were oppre&s;&s;ed, and they had no comforter: and on the &s;ide of the oppre&s;&s;ors there was power, but they had no comforter.</HI> If the rulers of a peo|ple do them&s;elves love iniquity, and are deter|mined to live in the open practice of any vice or abomination, it will be their de&s;ire and en|deavour to have &s;uch practices become fa&s;hion|able and cu&s;tomary. And if they frame a &s;y|&s;tem of laws that have any a&s;pect upon pro|moting virtue and religion, and bearing down vice and immorality, they will be careful to frame them in &s;uch a manner that the force of them may be ea&s;ily evaded, that they may not be as &s;hackles upon their own fuel to hamper them in their pur&s;uit after the objects of their lu&s;ts. And hence if righteou&s;ne&s;s ever reigns among a nation do as to form the general cha|racter of a people; we may be &s;ure that &s;uch a people are always under the government and
<PB N="16" REF="043429_0014_101CED97B24E4008">
regulation of a &s;y&s;tem of laws that are found|ed in righteou&s;ne&s;s; that the rulers of &s;uch a people are <HI>men that fear God and hate covetou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>And moreover,</P>
<P N="2">2. It implies that every one is faithful in his proper &s;tation and capacity, to put &s;uch laws into execution.</P>
<P>OF what avail can it be at any time for the rulers of a people to frame the mo&s;t whole|&s;ome laws for the health of a &s;tare, and to bear down all unrighteous&s;ne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion, if at the &s;ame time, the&s;e laws are not put into execution? To frame a &s;y&s;tem of laws for this purpo&s;e, and not put them into execution, is the mo&s;t direct way to bring a people to a &s;tate of anarchy and confu&s;ion. For when ru|lers have in this manner, taught a people to ca&s;t contempt upon a certain &s;et of laws, they will &s;oon learn to ca&s;t contempt upon all laws and government. Some times it is notoriou&s;ly the ca&s;e that rulers will live in the open vio|lation of tho&s;e laws which they them&s;elves have framed to bear down all open iniquity and un|righteou&s;ne&s;s. They them&s;elves lead the way in ca&s;ting contempt upon law and government; and no wonder that in &s;uch a ca&s;e the people &s;oon learn to pattern after the example of their
<PB N="17" REF="043429_0015_101CED9936BBC3B8">
leaders, and trample under foot all law and authority among&s;t them. It is in reference to &s;uch conduct of rulers as this that the wi&s;e man &s;ays, <HI>Woe unto thee, O land, when they king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning.</HI> That is, when thy rulers are given to gluttony, and a round of carnal plea&s;ures. For when this is their aim, and what they are re&s;olved upon, the reigns of government will be let loo&s;e, and will be thrown upon the necks of a people, and a &s;tate of anarchy, di&s;order and confu&s;ion will &s;oon take place, and every one will learn <HI>to do what is right in his own eyes.</HI>&mdash;Some times it is owing to a &s;tate of inveterate and abandoned wickedne&s;s among&s;t a people that the mo&s;t whole&s;ome laws cannot be put into execu|tion, notwith&s;tanding the rulers of a people may be over &s;o faithful. If a people are generally agreed, at all hazards, to have open wickedne&s;s reign triumphant among&s;t them, it will be to no purpo&s;e to have the mo&s;t righteous &s;y&s;tem of laws e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t them. Let the laws be ever &s;o well con&s;tructed to bear down all open wickedne&s;s, yet in vain may the rulers endeavour to put them into execution again&s;t &s;uch univer&s;al oppo&s;ition. When this becomes the &s;tate of a people, and they are thus abon|doned in wickedne&s;s, <HI>their di&s;ea&s;e is inveterate, and their wound is incurable.</HI> Anarchy and con|fu&s;ion will reign among them till they are re|duced to utter de&s;truction. That righteou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="18" REF="043429_0016_101CED9B00AC8BE0">
therefore / may reign among a people, it is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, not only that a &s;y&s;tem of laws be e&s;tabli&s;hed among them that are cal|culated to bear down all open wickedne&s;s; but al&s;o that every one is faithful, in his proper &s;tation and capacity, to put &s;uch laws into ex|ecution, <HI>to the terror of evil doors, and to the prai&s;e of tho&s;e that do well.</HI></P>
<P>I ADD once more,</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT the righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;poken of in the text implies that a people do &s;et them&s;elves to di&s;countenance all open wickedne&s;s in the tenor of their conduct.</P>
<P>If <HI>&s;in is a reproach to any people,</HI> then cer|tainly that people among whom righteou&s;ne&s;s reigns, will account a reproach, and endeavor to di&s;countenance it in the tenor of their con|duct. They will treat tho&s;e as &s;candalous per|&s;ons, who live in the open practice of any kind of wickedne&s;s. They will avoid their company, and withdraw from their &s;ociety and fellow&s;hip. So they treat a notorious thief. The genera|lity of a people do ever hold him as a &s;can|dalous per&s;on, and are a&s;hamed to keep com|pany with him. And if righteou&s;ne&s;s did reign triumphant among&s;t a people, they would be as much a&s;hamed to countenance or keep com|pany with vain &s;wearers, with &s;abbath-breakers.
<PB N="19" REF="043429_0017_101CEDA1AB6BC4B8">
with defamers and backbiters, with &s;uch is made it their practice to over-reach and defraud, to grind and oppre&s;s their fellow creatures in their dealings with them; I &s;ay, they would be as much a&s;hamed to countenance or keep company with any of &s;uch a character, as they would with an open and notorious thief. For the&s;e iniquities are, in their nature, as really &s;canda|lous as theft. They are as truly an abomina|tion in the &s;ight of God, and as diametrically contrary to that righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a nation. When therefore a per&s;on can live in the open practice of any of the&s;e iniquities, and yet not become a &s;candalous per&s;on among the people where he dwells; when he can live in the open practice of the&s;e iniquities, and yet pre&s;erve his reputation, and his company is not avoided; can it be imagined that &s;uch a people do look upon th&s;e iniquities as being any wi&s;e &s;candalous? Nay verily. In&s;tead of pur&s;uing after that righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a nation, they are ha&s;tening to that &s;tate of abandoned wickedne&s;s de&s;cribed by the Prophet in that &s;olemn interrogation, <HI>Were they a&s;hamed when they had committed abomination? Nay, they were not at all a&s;hamed, neither could they blu&s;h</HI>!&mdash;Enough has been &s;aid to lay open to view what is implied in that righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a nation.</P>

II. TO point out the rea&s;ons why this righ|teou&s;ne&s;s will exalt a nation.</P>
<P>AND in illu&s;trating this head, I would here &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT this righteou&s;ne&s;s is that wherein the real dignity and honor of a people con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>SOME are ready to e&s;teem a nation or people honorable in proportion as they are wealthy and powerful. But this of it&s;elf is &s;o far from ren|dering a people honorable, that on the contrary, if they make u&s;e of their power and wealth in an unrighteous manner, their being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of wealth and power does but &s;erve to render them the objects of the mo&s;t &s;olemn contempt and abhorrence. Let a nation be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ever &s;o much wealth and power, and let them make u&s;e of the&s;e to &s;pread deva&s;tation and ruin a|mong&s;t mankind, and to reduce their brethren to a &s;tate of &s;lavery to their lawle&s;s tyranny and dominion; in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this, will any one be wild enough to imagine that &s;uch a nation or people are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of true honor, meerly becau&s;e they are wealthy and powerful? Nay verily.&mdash;True honor and real dignity is ever founded in that righteou&s;ne&s;s which con&s;i&s;ts in a conformity to the laws and commands of the great Lord of all.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="043429_0019_101CEDACABA35B30">WHEN a people do evidently appear to re|verencce the rights of con&s;cience,&mdash;to pay a &s;a|cred regard to the wor&s;hip of God,&mdash;to be ac|tuated by a pious zeal in bearing down all fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion, and di&s;countenancing all vice and immorality of every kind; when it is thus with a people, there is nothing that can be a greater honor and dignity to them. The mo&s;t unbounded wealth and power is as nothing when compared with this, to render a people honorable. Each one will account it his honor and dignity to be in due &s;ubjection to the higher powers, and with alacrity of mind will be careful to <HI>render unto all their dues; tribute to whom tribute; cu&s;tom to whom cu&s;tom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.</HI> The wheels of government will perpetually move on in the utmo&s;t harmony, and without any jar or di&s;cord. And of &s;uch a people it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, in relation to their civil &s;tate, <HI>How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy dwellings, O I&s;rael!</HI>&mdash;This righte|ou&s;ne&s;s then is that wherein the real dignity and honor of a people con&s;i&s;ts.&mdash;But,</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation, as it brings a &s;eries of the &s;miles and ble&s;&s;ings of heaven upon them.</P>
<P>GOD always deals with his vi&s;ible people according to their vi&s;ible conduct. Never was it known, from the beginning of the world,
<PB N="22" REF="043429_0020_101CEDAE48997250">either under the law, or under the go&s;pel, that God &s;uffered his vi&s;ible people to be ruined, until they had openly departed from him, and had turned a&s;ide from the way of his &s;tatutes. No in&s;tance can be produced where God &s;uf|fered the enemies of his people to triumph over them whil&s;t they continued to put their tru&s;t in his name, and to walk in his ways. When our forefathers fir&s;t came over into New-England, they had &s;uch difficulties to encounter, and &s;uch formidable dangers were impending over them on every &s;ide, that it might &s;eem at fir&s;t view that nothing but perfect phrenzy and madne&s;s could induce them to believe it po&s;&s;ible for them to &s;urmount the difficulties and e&s;cape the dangers that lay in their way. But they found that <HI>the name of the Lord</HI> was <HI>a &s;trong tower, that the righteous run into it and</HI> were &s;afe. Righteou&s;ne&s;s was their glory; it was a <HI>crown and a diadem upon their head.</HI> They made God their refuge, and <HI>his own right hand, and his holy arm</HI> was their &s;afeguard and their defence in all &s;cenes of danger, and under every trial. Had they ca&s;t off the fear of God, and openly departed from him, we may with confidence, affirm that they would &s;oon have become a <HI>re|proach among the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and their names would have peri&s;hed.

<P N="3">3. RIGHTEOUSNESS exalteth a nation, as it is the only thing that can be a firm bond of union among them, and will in&s;pire univer&s;al confidence in them.</P>
<P>WHEN a nation or a people as &s;uch are evidently void of principle, and abandoned in wickedne&s;s, there can be no confidence had in the publick faith. Their lu&s;t of power, their unbounded avarice will readily induce them, upon almo&s;t every occa&s;ion to violate the mo&s;t &s;olemn compacts and covenants, in the mo&s;t fla|grant and daring manner. But if a people are united together upon the principles of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, this bond of union is like the <HI>threefold cord that is not ea&s;ily broken.</HI> It is a bond of union that will render a people faithful to each
<PB N="24" REF="043429_0022_101CAD88637D8E58">
other in all &s;cenes of danger, and under eve|ry trial. And when they are vi&s;ibly actuated by &s;uch principles as the&s;e in the tenor of their conduct, the utmo&s;t confidence will ever be had in the public faith; and every nation will be ready to &s;ay of &s;uch a people, <HI>Surely they are children that will not lie.</HI> And under this view &s;uch a people will ever be mo&s;t honorable in the e&s;teem of all to whom their character is known, and to their enemies they will be <HI>ter|rible as an army with banners.</HI>&mdash;Upon the&s;e accounts then it mo&s;t evidently appears that righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation, and is like a <HI>crown of diadem and glory to</HI> any people. The time being far &s;pent requires that I ha&s;ten to the last thing propo&s;ed from the text which is,</P>
<P N="3">III. To conclude with tho&s;e addre&s;&s;es that naturally ari&s;e out of my &s;ubject, and are &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion before us.</P>
<P>AND here I am reminded to turn my&s;elf in the fir&s;t place, by way of addre&s;s to hi Ex|cellency the Governor, and the honorable Coun|cil of this State.</P>
<P><HI>Much honored Sirs,</HI></P>
<P>I AM under no apprehen&s;ions that the great plainne&s;s of &s;peech I have indulged in laying open to view the duty of rulers, and the &s;a|cred

Importance of their being <HI>men that fear God and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> coveteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> will in any degree di&s;gu&s;t your minds, or prove offen&s;ive to you. Had I departed from the line of my duty, and acted &s;o much out of the character of an Am|ba&s;&s;ador of Chri&s;t, as to have con&s;umed the proceeding hour in treating the rulers of this people with an empty round of ful&s;ome com|plements; I had ju&s;tly rendered my&s;elf an object of your compa&s;&s;ion and re&s;entment. I would ever regard it as a duty of &s;acred importance in relation to my&s;elf, and urge it upon others, as occa&s;ion may offer, to render that honor to the higher powers which God in his word re|quires. It is e&s;&s;ential to the health and well being of a &s;tate, that &s;uch be had in honor and reverence by the people whom they govern. And I would to God that this honor and re|verence to the rulers of this people, may ever be founded on that &s;acred regard to righteou&s;|ne&s;s and true piety that &s;hall be vi&s;ible and evident in the con&s;tant tenor of their conduct. This will command that re&s;pect and reverence, that honor and e&s;teem, which is real and &s;olid; and which will have an exten&s;ive influence in forming the manners, and regulation the con|duct of a people. You will con&s;ider your&s;elves as the leaders of this people; that your example in your public department will ever carry much weight and energy in it; that it will have an almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;table power to leaven the manners
<PB N="26" REF="043429_0024_101CEDBE0E8AB3B8">
and form the character of this people. A peo|ple will follow the example of their leaders; and under this view a &s;ett of vicious rulers are in a great degree, accountable for that flood of wickedne&s;s that does at any time over&s;pread a country. <HI>We unto thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning.</HI> You will then con&s;ider your&s;elves as being ac|countable to God, and to this people another day, for the execution of the important tru&s;t committed unto you; and with a view to this, will gird up the lions of your mind to execute ju&s;tice and judgment; to bear down all vice and immorality; to promote the intere&s;t of reli|gion, and the pro&s;perity of Chri&s;t's kingdom among the people whom you govern. This will lay the mo&s;t effectual foundation for your ru|ling this people with comfort and in peace, till you and they are gathered together into that kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s above, where each one &s;hall reign in life by Je&s;us Chri&s;t!</P>

But I may, with con|fidence, affirm, that never was civil authority more honored and revered, than when they have had the intere&s;t of religion at heart, and made it their aim to promote it in their public de|partment; and that never was it rendered more contemptable than when they &s;uffered vice and immorality to reign triumphant.
