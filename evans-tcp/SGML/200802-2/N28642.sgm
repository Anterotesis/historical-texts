<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the occa&s;ion of our a&s;&s;embling this day is uncommon, it is not the le&s;s important.</P>
<P>As families and villages publicly mourn the lo&s;s of individual members; &s;o the nation mourns the fall of her Friend, her Hero, her Founder. He being the Benefactor and Father of all, which town or hamlet, from Maine to Georgia, would be willingly excluded from this general Lamen|tation?</P>
<P>Though the annals of OUR country afford no example of the kind; though we are in danger of adopting tokens of extreme &s;orrow; yet this is not the fir&s;t in&s;tance of national mourning. For forty days, Jacob, the Hebrew patriarch was mourned in the nation where he died.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="038184_0003_1011168898CB5DC8">Pelopidas,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plutarch.</NOTE> the Theban, &s;lain in a foreign war, when borne to his native State, was met on the way, as he pa&s;t through the cities, by magi&s;trates, by young men, by children, by <HI>the mini&s;ters of religion</HI> with all the pomp, which could give <HI>him</HI> honor, or expre&s;s <HI>their</HI> grief. The The&s;&s;alians, in who&s;e cau&s;e he had fallen, importuned the privi|lege of directing his funeral &s;olemnities.</P>
<P>But the fir&s;t ORATION, pronounced in honor of the dead, mentioned in hi&s;tory, was delivered by Poplicola at the death of Brutus; that Brutus, &s;o renowned for his di&s;intere&s;ted zeal in giving &s;entence of death again&s;t his own &s;ons guilty of trea&s;on. For him the Roman women mourned a whole year; two months longer than for their neare&s;t relations.</P>
<P>The Commonwealth interred Poplicola at the public expence, and to expre&s;s their affectionate veneration for the man, the women by common con&s;ent lamented his death a year, "as if he had been a &s;on, a brother, or father."</P>
<P><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bingham's Antiquities of the Chri&s;tian Church.</NOTE> The fir&s;t Chri&s;tians adopted the cu&s;tom of funeral eulogies; they were pronounced at the

grave of the &s;aint; to render the &s;cene more &s;ol|emn, the emblems of their crucified Savior were admini&s;tered. But neither Chri&s;tians for the lo&s;s of a brother, nor Greeks, nor Romans, for the fall of their Con&s;uls and Generals, had &s;uch cau&s;e for mourning as the States of America, at the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>Probably NO MAN ever united &s;o many great talents, and reigned &s;o entirely in the hearts of <HI>millions,</HI> as he who&s;e departure the nation mourns. The Poets and Orators of the world will blazon his virtues, and the la&s;t age of time admire the wonderous man.</P>
<P>Were the Speaker to take a part in the eulogies of the day his words might be lo&s;t as a drop of dew on the bo&s;om of ocean: &s;till it may be DUTY to remark, that we are un&s;peakably indebted to God for rai&s;ing up &s;uch a character, at &s;uch a time; a character who&s;e moderation, who&s;e gentlene&s;s, who&s;e purity was &s;o adapted to the moral habits, and religious opinions of his country. While clad in panoply dreadful; terrible to his enemies, as the fiery bolt of heaven; he was gentle as the Shepherd of a flock, compa&s;&s;ionate as the Pa|rent of a family. Mercy &s;oftened his ju&s;tice; humanity tempered his vengeance, and the crim|&s;on of his &s;word, was the blood of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="038184_0005_1011168DD2C874D8">The idea of conque&s;t and triumph, of inva&s;ion and &s;laughter, never darted its contagion amid the reflections of his mind. Had this humane &s;pirit been wanting; had he been merely the rough &s;oldier, or daring Commander, Americans would have been di&s;gu&s;ted; their confidence lo&s;t; the pro&s;pects of the revolution wrapt in darkne&s;s. He never wounded the brea&s;t of &s;en&s;ibility, nev|er extorted a tear from morality, nor a &s;igh from religion: He never gave his country "pain, but when he died."</P>
<P>His INVENTIVE genius was <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> What in other circum&s;tances might have been <HI>convenient</HI> was <HI>here e&s;&s;ential.</HI> A va&s;t extent of defencele&s;s territory, towns and cities, rai&s;ed the &s;upplicating eye, and implored protection from him. A race of harmle&s;s farmers, from their birth living in habits of equality, independent lords of the &s;oil, revolting at the thought of military &s;ubordina|tion, were the unpromi&s;ing materials to form a defence again&s;t the di&s;ciplined valor of European Veterans. Much of his artillery &s;lumbered in the hills of ore; much of his ammunition &s;lept in the du&s;t, or bade him defiance in the magazines of his foe.</P>
<P>All the <HI>&s;tratagems</HI> of <HI>creative</HI> genius encouraged his friends, awed the enemy, and &s;aved the cau&s;e

Under his eye the hu&s;bandman &s;oon became the Champion of Freedom, the field of harve&s;ts the citadel of war, on the hill of flocks was the blaze of battle, and the flag of INDEPENDENCE waved over the deep. The metamorpho&s;es of poetic fic|tion &s;eemed vi&s;ible in <HI>real life.</HI> His mea&s;ures of|ten di&s;appointed the calculations of prudence, overleaped the rules of &s;y&s;tem, while the cloud of adver&s;ity guided his banner to the hill of victory. When he &s;eemed to re&s;t quietly in his camp, like the &s;lumbering volcano, he has unexpectedly bur&s;t on his foe in a deluge of fire.</P>
<P>His FORTITUDE in &s;ea&s;ons, which tried the mo&s;t intrepid minds, was a golden pillar in the tem|ple of his merit. When his wants were multipli|ed; when revolt rai&s;ed her &s;tandard; when nece&s;&s;i|ty be&s;ieged his camp; when re&s;ources failed; when the &s;eas &s;aid, "They are not in us," and the fields, "They are not in us," like the rock of the billows, or the hill of &s;torms, he bore all with invincible <HI>fortitude.</HI></P>
<P>Undi&s;mayed he left the i&s;les of Newyork; un|di&s;mayed he abandoned the fortre&s;&s;es of the Hud|&s;on, while the crim&s;on of their &s;teps betrayed the cour&s;e of his de&s;ponding troops. The Ameri|can conte&s;t, the Liberties of mankind, appeared to tremble in the &s;cale of events; the voice of
<PB N="10" REF="038184_0007_10111698633B2658">
popular zeal had &s;unk almo&s;t to the whi&s;per of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The Commander in Chief remains unmoved. Though he knew when to retire; yet like the bla&s;t of the tempe&s;t, it was to return with increa&s;ing fury.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hed Delaware bore him back to vic|tory; the triumph at Trenton rou&s;ed the country to a &s;en&s;e of their own force; gave the mortal &s;tab to oppre&s;&s;ion, broke the &s;ceptre of de&s;poti&s;m. Like the &s;un ob&s;cured by clouds, but not extin|gui&s;hed, he continued the &s;ame in every exigence.</P>
<P>His unaffected MODESTY after all the &s;ervices he had done, all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es he had borne, all the honor he had won, was a diadem of glory, was a <HI>prodigy</HI> of human virtue. A&s;cribing to the aid of other Agents, or immediately referring to the PROVIDENCE OF GOD the great events in which he was the principal Actor, <HI>What did he ever arrogate to him&s;elf?</HI> His replies accepting the great appointments of his country; his addre&s;&s;es re&s;ign|ing tho&s;e appointments, are the uniform language of his life; they &s;how the great man ri&s;ing above him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Travellers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bri&s;&s;ot's travels in the United States.</NOTE> have been &s;urpri&s;ed at the mode&s;t manner in which he de&s;cribed tho&s;e events of
<PB REF="038184_0008_1011169C008F43C8">
the revolution, which covered him with glory, and made a bloody page in the hi&s;tory of war. The manner was the &s;ame, as if he had not been pre&s;ent, or only an ob&s;erving &s;pectator.</P>
<P>But the unrivalled &s;plendor of his character beamed from his DISINTERESTED &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Without that ambition for fame or wealth, which frequently fires the heart, and directs the actions of men, he was reclining under the groves of Vernon, or ploughing his own field, when the voice of millions called him to lead their armies. His favorite indulgences allured him to refu&s;e; his benevolence required him to comply; he did not he&s;itate; he became our Captain.</P>
<P>How con&s;tantly was the &s;ame &s;elf denial nece&s;|&s;ary during the uncertain, the di&s;mal conte&s;t. A narration of the&s;e trials would be the hi&s;tory of the revolution.</P>
<P>When he had given &s;overeign INDEPENDENCE to his country; when he had rai&s;ed her to em|pire and glory; when he had repelled the foe, and hu&s;hed the thunders of inva&s;ion; when he had fixed the confidence of his country, and the admiration of the world, he then <HI>re&s;igned his &s;word;</HI> that &s;word, which courted his hand; with
<PB N="12" REF="038184_0009_1011169D901D7530">
tears he bade adieu to that army, who would have given him their <HI>blood;</HI> who would have made him perpetual Dictator: He became a private cit|izen with that people, who <HI>could not</HI> have refu&s;|ed him a THRONE.</P>
<P>Here gaze, ye Cae&s;ars, ye Cromwells, ye Buon|apartes, of the world, and &s;hrink into your mer|ited non-exi&s;tence! But here was no &s;truggle of pa&s;&s;ions, no <HI>trial</HI> for the <HI>pure</HI> benevolence of WASHINGTON. The ble&s;&s;ings of his country at|tend him, as he retires to the banks of Potow|mac; their prayers a&s;cend for his peace and final happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But a more painful que&s;tion demands his deci|&s;ion. Can he, will he again &s;acrifice his wi&s;hes? Look, ye children of men, look ye angels of light, &s;ee a &s;pirit of benevolence like thine own. He feared not the lo&s;s of tho&s;e honors, which he nev|er &s;ought; he grudged not any &s;ervice for that people, who were dearer to him than the blood which rolled through his heart; but fatigued with the toils of the crim&s;on field; tired of public life, he &s;ighed for repo&s;e. Yet he con&s;ents to pre&s;ide over the nation, which his &s;word had e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Here the frozen calculations of worldly wi&s;|dom, the mechanical balancing of arguments yield
<PB N="13" REF="038184_0010_101116A28681E4C0">
to the fervent impul&s;e of di&s;intere&s;ted zeal for the public good. Ju&s;tly to e&s;timate his virtues, or to recommend them to others, requires a &s;pirit pure and benevolent like his own. The beams of morn extingui&s;h the &s;tars; the meridian blaze dazzles the eye; we need not, therefore, <HI>mention</HI> his re|&s;igning the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> office of his country, or his accept|ance of a &s;ubordinate &s;tation. So great were his other &s;acrifices that we forget to tell, that the bread which he eat, and the happine&s;s of doing good, were all his reward for years and years of toil in the be&s;t part of his life.</P>
<P>But to omit his VALOR would be to <HI>rob</HI> the He|ro. How many hills and plains have &s;huddered to &s;ee his cool, undaunted valor! His courage was not the rage of Brutus,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plutarch.</NOTE> hurrying to death in &s;ingle combat; it was not the fury of Mahomet,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Echard.</NOTE> riding into the &s;ea to &s;upport his di&s;tant fleet; it was not the madne&s;s of Pelopidas, ru&s;hing from life before his army; but that di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate pre&s;ence of mind, which en&s;ures victory, or prevents the common di&s;a&s;ters of defeat. He never wantonly expo&s;ed a hair of his head; he never turned his bo&s;om from the hotte&s;t battle when duty called.</P>
<P>His ardor in the field was not a thir&s;t for <HI>fame;</HI> but the indignant &s;pirit of <HI>&s;elf defence;</HI> it was not
<PB N="14" REF="038184_0011_101116ABAC36AA20">
a frenzy of <HI>raving pa&s;&s;ion;</HI> but the calm dictates of <HI>con&s;cience:</HI> it was not <HI>delight</HI> in <HI>&s;laughter;</HI> but the <HI>zeal</HI> of &s;aving his country.</P>
<P>His enemies will relate the deeds of his bravery to other times. The batteries of York-Town, the plains of Monmouth, numerous hills of blood, eulogize the &s;word of his battles. In &s;trains en|chanting the Monongahela &s;trikes the &s;ong, the Hud&s;on, the Delaware, the Schuylkill, and Bran|dywine, &s;well the chorus of his valor.</P>
<P>His SUCCESS completes the glory of his name. Here he ro&s;e on the breath of heaven above the &s;phere of his own great actions. No virtue is &s;o &s;potle&s;s, no courage &s;o undaunted, no di&s;cretion &s;o watchful, as to <HI>en&s;ure</HI> &s;uch a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;uch a tide of glory. The uniform confidence of his country was a phenomenon great, like the vir|tues of his mind, the remarkable deeds of his life, the almo&s;t miraculous interpo&s;itions of Providence in his behalf. Republics are not in the habit of &s;uch uniformity or gratitude. It will probably &s;tand as a political wonder in the hi&s;tory of man, during the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, that he &s;o long enjoyed the unwavering confidence of the&s;e States. That they &s;hould have &s;agacity to di&s;cover him among millions, and wi&s;dom to give him their con&s;tant &s;upport merits them va&s;t applau&s;e. He
<PB N="15" REF="038184_0012_101116AD311D68F8">
was as evidently a favorite of Providence, as of his country: He as con&s;picuou&s;ly enjoyed the protection of his God, as the cordial veneration of his fellowcitizens. The time of his birth, the peculiar &s;tate of his country, many things in which He had no influence, as well as the energetic pow|ers, the un&s;ullied virtues of his own mind, all con&s;pired to render him what he was, the Found|er of our Republic, the pride of his country, the admiration of mankind.</P>
<P>Nor ought it to be forgotten that he enjoyed powerful aid. The &s;words of Green and Putnam<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>General PUTNAM commanded in the celebrated action of Bunker or Breed's hill. It is a &s;ingular circum&s;tance that this &s;hould not be more generally known.&mdash;Putnam was the commanding officer of the party, who went upon the hill the evening before the action: he commanded in the ac|tion: he harangued his men as the Briti&s;h fir&s;t advanced, charged them to re&s;erve their fire, till they were near, <HI>'till they could &s;ee the white of their eyes,'</HI> were his words.&mdash; At the &s;econd a&s;&s;ault he commended their former calmne&s;s, a&s;&s;ured them "they would now do much better," and directed them "to aim at the officers." They obeyed. The fire was tremendous. <HI>'My God,'</HI> &s;aid Putnam, in telling the &s;tory, <HI>'I never &s;aw &s;uch a carnage of the human race.'</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e things he related to the Reverend Mr. Whitney, his Mini&s;ter, by who&s;e permi&s;&s;ion they are now publi&s;hed.&mdash;In a note of his &s;ermon occa&s;ioned by the death of the General, he &s;ays, "The detachment at fir&s;t was put under the com|mand of General Putnam, with it he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hill, and ordered the battle from beginning to the end. General Warren arrived alone on the hill and as a <HI>Volunteer</HI> joined the Americans ju&s;t as the action commenced.&mdash;The&s;e <HI>facts</HI> General Putnam him&s;elf gave me &s;oon after the battle and <HI>repeated</HI> them after his life was printed. The General, who encouraged and animated his &s;oldiers, by his words and example, to prodigies of bravery, is highly to be hon|ored, and the prai&s;e not given to <HI>another,</HI> however meritorious in other re&s;pects. Other evidence, to confirm what I have here &s;aid, I am able to produce, if any &s;hould call for it."</P>
<P>Mr. Whitney has a letter written him by an officer, who was in the action, a&s;&s;erting that Putnam was Commander. While writing this note an officer of rank, who was wound|ed in the battle, who &s;aw Warren fall, tells me I may "be a&s;&s;ured, General Putnam was the officer who led the party to the hill, who marked the ground to be fortified, and com|manded in the action."</P></NOTE>

<P>To &s;how he <HI>needs</HI> not the <HI>noble&s;t</HI> in&s;truments; to &s;how his INDEPENDENCE, GOD removes them from the world. Nothing can impoveri&s;h him, who creates: A Tyrant he rai&s;es up in the land of Ham to &s;how his mighty power: That
<PB N="21" REF="038184_0018_101116C173AABEE0">
Tyrant he de&s;troys to &s;how he was not nece&s;&s;ary. Kings and Conquerors are as ea&s;ily formed, as drops of dew, or floating atoms. While the &s;mall|e&s;t evils may ruin the great men of this world, the greate&s;t, <HI>actually promote</HI> the de&s;igns of Provi|dence. On mount Gilboa the royal Warriors fall, "who were the beauty of I&s;rael, who were &s;wift|er than eagles, who were &s;tronger than lions; on who&s;e face was &s;een the rage of battles, the &s;tep of death was behind their &s;words, the blood of ar|mies on their &s;pears."</P>
<P>Cities have a&s;cended in burning vapor, as leaves of the fore&s;t; a world has been drowned, as a &s;hip in the &s;torm. The maje&s;ty of his kingdom, the riches of his empire, the awful magnificence of his government, confounds our calculations, when dreadful &s;cenes &s;trike the view, when God hides in darkne&s;s the fir&s;t Agents of the world. This INDE|PENDENCE of means commands our admiration.</P>
<P>God, al&s;o calls away the principal Actors from the world to make room for the <HI>forming</HI> of OTH|ERS. Such is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, that but few can be eminently great at the &s;ame time. If all were Generals, who would compo&s;e the phal|anx? If all were rulers, who would be the &s;ub|jects? Had Nimrod and the officers of his gov|ernment continued till this time, how may great
<PB N="22" REF="038184_0019_101116C832DEA4E0">
men mu&s;t have remained in their original ob|&s;curity.</P>
<P>Seldom does the <HI>exigence</HI> of the time fail of pro|ducing the characters required. The moment he was needed, the Hero of Columbia ro&s;e. Had he been immortal, no other like him would have appeared, no other would have been nece&s;&s;ary. By the removal of &s;uch there may be a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of great men, as long continued as the duration of the world, more numerous than the genera|tions of time: Therefore there may be a period when every <HI>hill</HI> &s;hall have been a VERNON, and every <HI>family</HI> have furni&s;hed a WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>Though the beloved man is fallen, there is no &s;hadow of doubt, but the hour which demands, will al&s;o exhibit <HI>another</HI> formed for the occa&s;ion. It is the folly of error for us to tremble, or for our enemies to exult, as if he, who rai&s;ed up one, can|not &s;end a ho&s;t of Wa&s;hingtons. An ADAMS <HI>lives,</HI> and when God de&s;igns to ble&s;s a people, there will always be found the nece&s;&s;ary Agents; a Mo&s;es where the chains of a De&s;pot are to be broken; a Cyrus where a captive nation find de|liverance; a Wa&s;hington where the banner of in|dependence is unfurled, or a new Empire e&s;tab|li&s;hed. As the mortality of great men multiplies great men, it renders the world a nur&s;ery of Gen|ius,
<PB N="23" REF="038184_0020_101116CD4AA2AFD0">
a &s;chool of virtue and glory. Ea&s;y it is, there|fore to ju&s;tify Providence in calling u&s;eful Agents from earthly &s;cenes.</P>
<P>We may here remark that the Almighty Gov|ernor removes men from life, when the WORK is ACCOMPLISHED for which they were DESIGNED. The God of knowledge perfectly knows what is the work of every per&s;on, as he enters on the &s;tage of life. When his work is done, the agent lives to no purpo&s;e, therefore rea&s;on approves, right|eou&s;ne&s;s demands his removal. Every actor good and bad retires when his part in the drama is fin|i&s;hed. God perfectly knew the work of Egypt's king; therefore when he di&s;played his la&s;t judg|ment, when his work was <HI>done,</HI> he was whelmed in the deep, he left the world.</P>
<P>Redemption was the work of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; therefore when that work was 'fini&s;hed,' he was the pri&s;oner of Death: Why &s;hould not the agent be removed when his ta&s;k is <HI>accompli&s;hed?</HI></P>
<P>To teach men their DEPENDENCE upon God for great characters, He often removes them in the mid&s;t of their u&s;efulne&s;s. The view of a long, a con&s;tant &s;eries of events, without derangement or change, is apt to efface our convictions of the divine agency, which gives exi&s;tence and energy
<PB N="24" REF="038184_0021_101116D04BCA0548">
to all. Men long accu&s;tomed to enjoy law and protection from the wi&s;e and valiant, too fre|quently forget the hand, who rai&s;ed them up; they regard the &s;ervants of God, as the <HI>authors</HI> of the ble&s;&s;ings, while they are only the <HI>means</HI> of pro|ducing them. That God may not be robbed of his glory, he removes tho&s;e u&s;eful per&s;ons, who prevented us from &s;eeing his goodne&s;s. Was not the Prophet's &s;chool deeply awed with a pre&s;ent God, and a &s;en&s;e of their own <HI>dependence</HI> when they &s;aw the man of God a&s;cending in a chariot of fire?</P>
<P>Finally, God removes great agents to teach great men, THEY MUST DIE. All men, but e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e <HI>pro&s;perous,</HI> are too little &s;olicitous re|&s;pecting their di&s;&s;olution, and the unknown e|vents beyond the grave. The cares of bu&s;ine&s;s, the pride of wealth, the flatteries of greatne&s;s, the enchantments of plea&s;ure, &s;eize their hearts, and direct their actions.</P>
<P>Were none to die, but tho&s;e worn out with years, none but tho&s;e no longer u&s;eful; were none but the dregs of mankind &s;wept into the grave, Who, among the active and great, would think of death, or prepare for heaven? But when the mighty man falls, his companions in honor &s;ee, that while they are re&s;pected as <HI>Gods,</HI> they
<PB N="25" REF="038184_0022_101116D1DB013158">
mu&s;t die like <HI>men.</HI> They &s;ee that no degree of importance repels the &s;haft of death; the tyrant delights to &s;pread his terrors, to make the great tremble, the world mourn.</P>
<P>In a critical day, when the Hebrew camp &s;eem|ed to need his wi&s;dom, with Canaan's hills in view, their Leader, their Legi&s;lator, their Wa&s;h|ington expires; he pa&s;&s;es from the top of Nebo to his &s;eat in glory. While the wonders of his benevolence were enlightening the world; while the &s;pirits of the good were ravi&s;hed by his divine eloquence, the <HI>Prophet</HI> of <HI>Nazareth</HI> was nailed to the tree. While a great part of mankind are in arms, and his country trembles, as a barque in the &s;torm, the Defender of America de&s;cends in|to his tomb. From his importance to &s;ociety, Who can pre&s;ume on life?</P>
<P>Thus rea&s;ons vi&s;ible plead for the afflictive won|ders of divine &s;overeignty, which &s;ummon from earth the great and good. Mo&s;t important con|&s;iderations demand &s;uch di&s;pen&s;ations. Plea&s;ant is the office to &s;peak for God, to ju&s;tify his con|duct towards the great, the good, the wi&s;e men of the earth: Yet what is more dreadful in the divine government, than the mortality of &s;uch per&s;ons? Therefore though we "know not now," we may 'hereafter' know why other re|markable

circum&s;tances exi&s;t; why wickedne&s;s, famine, and pe&s;tilence, depopulate the world; why moral darkne&s;s reigns; why the beams of rational religion illume &s;o &s;mall a part of man|kind; why we inherit danger and di&s;tre&s;s; why infants expire, and guilt wakens a fire that <HI>never</HI> dies.</P>
<P>As God has rea&s;ons wi&s;e for the terrible acts of his authority, SUBMISSION becomes the heart of man. Still the event we contemplate is &s;erious; a great man, whom God delighted to honor, is fallen. He loved our nation, his name was a formidable ho&s;t. The &s;tar is &s;et, which guided us through a dark night of imminent dangers; gone is the cloud, which gave terror to our foes, light and &s;afety to his country. He was happy, not in his own &s;plendor, but in our pro&s;perity; he lived not for him&s;elf, but for us. How many years of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing days, and di&s;mal nights in the blaze of &s;ummer, and the fro&s;t of winter, did he hazard his life in the bloody field! He made ev|ery &s;acrifice, welcomed every burden, dared every danger, which the public good required. When did he refu&s;e to die for his country? From what &s;cene of carnage did he ever fly? What was his REWARD for all his &s;ervices? Like the moun|tains of the new world, he ro&s;e with unrivalled &s;ublimity.</P>

<P>Mourn for him then, my country, mourn; let not this day be a cold formality. Weep for him, ye who cultivate the &s;oil; he repelled the ho&s;ts of inva&s;ion from your &s;hore.
