<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> following Sermon is not pre&s;ented to the Public, from an idea that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es any peculiar mer|it, on account of depth of thought; originality of ideas; or beauty of arrangement. The Author, when he wrote it, had not the lea&s;t idea of its ever thus appear|ing abroad. But &s;uch was the occa&s;ion, upon which it was delivered, that the Church of Haverhill unani|mou&s;ly de&s;ired, and continued to de&s;ire a copy of it for the Pre&s;s. And, after declining, for a con&s;iderable time, the Author complied with their wi&s;hes, appre|hending, that the truths it contains, may be of &s;ervice; e&s;pecially to the Church and People, whom he had left, and for whom he feels a tender concern.</P>

<P>And now, brethren, I commend you to GOD, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them, who are &s;anctified.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_PAUL had preached the Go&s;pel at Ephe|&s;us, and been the in&s;trument of plant|ing a Church there. He had remained with them for &s;everal years, teaching and admoni&s;hing them, till he probably viewed them to be <HI>rooted and grounded in the truth.</HI> He then pur&s;ued his tour, to preach the glad tidings of &s;alvation in the regions round about them. After a while, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to leave tho&s;e parts, and to return to Jeru&s;alem. Upon this journey he touched at Mi|letus; and from thence he &s;ent and collected the El|ders of the Church of Ephe&s;us, to addre&s;s to them his la&s;t charge; his farewell di&s;cour&s;e. This he in|troduces by an appeal to their con&s;ciences, in which he recounts his own mini&s;terial faithfulne&s;s among them. "<HI>Ye know from the fir&s;t day that I came into A|&s;ia,
<PB N="6" REF="038515_0004_101248508BF2A3B8">
after what manner I have been with you at all &s;ea|&s;ons, &s;erving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears and temptations, which befel me by the lying in wait of the Jews; and how I kept, back nothing, which was profitable unto you; but have &s;howed you, and taught you publicly, and from hou&s;e to hou&s;e; te&s;tifying both to the Jews, and al&s;o to the Greeks, repentance to|wards God, and faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI>" He proceeds, and tells them, that he was now going bound in &s;pirit to Jeru&s;alem; <HI>i. e.</HI> convinced in con|&s;cience that God called him thither; that he knew not what trials were to befal him there, except that in every city he was notified, by the Holy Spirit, that bond and afflictions awaited him. But his courage was no<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">ired. "<HI>None of the&s;e things move me; neither count I my life dear unto my&s;elf, &s;o that I might fini&s;h my cour&s;e with joy, and the mini&s;try, which I have received, to te&s;tify the Go&s;pel of the grace of God.</HI>" Paul then &s;ugge&s;ts to them that this was their la&s;t inter|view on earth; that they &s;hould &s;ee his face here no more. He, therefore, calls on them to bear him witne&s;s, that he had faithfully cleared him&s;elf from the blood of &s;ouls. For he had not concealed from them any part of the revealed coun&s;el of God; but had boldly declared it all. So that, if any at Ephe&s;us now peri&s;hed, their blood mu&s;t be up|on their own heads! Paul, then, &s;olemnly enjoins on them <HI>faithfulne&s;s,</HI> both to them&s;elves, and to their churches. And to induce them to this, he warns them of approaching dangers. "<HI>For I know, that after my departure, &s;hall grievous wolves enter in among you, not &s;paring the flock.</HI>" q. d. The enemy will take an advantage from my ab&s;ence, and will introduce their favorite teachers; yea, the latter will be ready to introduce them&s;elves, and to improve ev|ery &s;ubtil argument and opportunity to gain pro&s;e|lytes, without any regard to the good of &s;ouls. For, however the&s;e teachers are adorned with &s;heep's clothing, (<HI>i. e.</HI> with great pretences, and &s;ome ap|pearances
<PB N="7" REF="038515_0005_1012481BB17047D0">
of benevolence and religion,) yet they are no better than wolves among &s;heep; prowling from fold to fold; caring nothing for the flock; but to gorge their own appetites; and, with <HI>good words, and fair &s;peeches,</HI> to deceive the hearts of the &s;imple. Yea, he warns them that &s;ome of their own members would become perver&s;e &s;chi&s;matics; and that di&s;ci|ples, (probably from their more loo&s;e and un&s;table characters,) would be drawn away after them. He renewedly charges them, therefore, to <HI>watch</HI> and to recollect his warnings, and his care, which for a number of years he had exhibited among them.</P>
<P>Paul then adds, as in our text; "<HI>And now, breth|ren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inherit|ance among all them, who are &s;anctified.</HI>" This he doubtle&s;s e&s;teemed a ble&s;&s;ed privilege, that, ina&s;much as he mu&s;t bid them a final adieu on earth, he might carry them to God, and leave them at his feet.</P>
<P>Upon the text, it may be &s;uitable, at this time, to &s;how,</P>
<P N="1">I. What was implied in Paul's commending his Ephe&s;ian brethren to God, and to the word of his grace. And,</P>
<P N="2">II. What encouragement he had thus to do. "<HI>Which is able to build you up, &amp;c.</HI>"</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t idea, It implied much. It implied his tender affection and concern for them; that he bore them upon his heart; that they were dear to him. It implied, that he was about to leave them. For though it be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">able for chri&s;tian friends <HI>ever,</HI> though pre&s;ent, to commend each other to God; yet this is an expre&s;&s;ion more peculiarly adapted to a parting &s;cene. The Apo&s;tle was to have the im|mediate charge of them no more. He, therefore, by faith, commits them to God; lays them at his feet, or places them <HI>near</HI> to him, as the word in the orig|inal, <HI>Paratithemi,</HI> imports. It implies Paul's confi|dence in God; in the glory and rectitude of his gov|ernment;
<PB N="8" REF="038515_0006_101248531E94CBE0">
that God governs all events and things in glorious wi&s;dom and benevolence. Otherwi&s;e, Paul would have e&s;teemed it no privilege to com|mend his dear friends to God; for there would be no &s;afety in their lying at his feet. They might re|ceive <HI>good</HI> or <HI>ill</HI> treatment; and there would be no foundation for confidence. But Paul's commending them to God implied his full belief, that, under the Divine Government, all things will terminate well; that infinite Power, Wi&s;dom and Benevolence &s;it at helm, and will cau&s;e that light &s;hall, eventually, &s;pring out of darkne&s;s, and order out of confu&s;ion, to the eternal joy and &s;alvation of all <HI>the benevolent;</HI> that there is, hence, a glorious foundation for un|&s;haken confidence in God.</P>
<P>And his commending them to the word of God's grace, al&s;o implied much. It implied, that he view|ed this word as their <HI>guide,</HI> their <HI>polar &s;tar,</HI> their <HI>mean</HI> of &s;alvation. God could work <HI>without</HI> the means, of which he now makes u&s;e, if he plea&s;ed. But it is <HI>not</HI> his will thus to do; but to work <HI>by</HI> means. Certain means are appointed by God, and mu&s;t be attended to by man, <HI>as God directs,</HI> in order that certain ends may be obtained. God of old ap|pointed the ark, as the mean of Noah's &s;afety from the deluge. He appointed the pa&s;&s;over, and the &s;prinkling of the blood, in I&s;rael, as the mean of their &s;afety from the &s;word of the de&s;troying angel. He appointed Mo&s;es' rod, as the mean of producing the plagues upon Egypt; of dividing the Red Sea; and of bringing water from the rock. He appoint|ed the brazen &s;erpent, as the mean of healing for the bitten, dying I&s;raelite. He appointed the blowing of rams' horns by the prie&s;ts, leading the congrega|tion of I&s;rael round the walls of Jericho, once a day, for &s;even days; and on the &s;eventh day, <HI>&s;even times,</HI> as the mean of the de&s;truction of tho&s;e walls; and of the going in of the cho&s;en tribes to po&s;&s;e&s;s the promi&s;ed land. He appointed the arming of three
<PB N="9" REF="038515_0007_1012481E381AA3F0">
hundred men, under Gideon, with trumpets, with pitchers, and lights in them; that they &s;hould blow their trumpets, da&s;h their pitchers, and cry, "<HI>The &s;word of the Lord and of Gideon,</HI>" as the mean of rout|ing the numerous ho&s;ts of I&s;rael's enemies, who were encamped again&s;t them.</P>
<P>And God has, <HI>in like manner,</HI> appointed his word, and the preaching of his Go&s;pel, as the mean of the &s;alvation of &s;ouls. The two latter in&s;tances mention|ed were, doubtle&s;s, lively emblems of this appoint|ment. To this mean of grace, &s;ouls mu&s;t attend in love and obedience to God; or they are not in way to heaven. And to this mean of grace, it appears Paul commended his Ephe&s;ian brethren. He was &s;en&s;ible that "<HI>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</HI>" He had fully learned, that it was <HI>by the Go&s;pel</HI> that &s;ouls were begotten unto a lively hope; and, <HI>by the word,</HI> that they are wa&s;hed or &s;anctified; "<HI>Wa&s;hed in water by the word.</HI>" To this, therefore, Paul joyfully commended his chri&s;tian friends, when parting from them. I pa&s;s on now to &s;how,</P>
<P N="2">II. What encouragement he had thus to do. "<HI>Which is able to build you up, and to give you an inher|itance among all them, who are &s;anctified.</HI>" The rela|tive <HI>which,</HI> here, may refer either to the antecedent <HI>God</HI>; or the <HI>word</HI> of his grace. And <HI>both</HI> were able thus to build them up; <HI>i. e. God</HI> was infinitely able to do it by his word; and his <HI>word</HI> was able to do it, when he made it &s;o, and rendered it a favor of life unto life. Paul was &s;en&s;ible, that the word of God was mighty, through the Spirit, to the pulling down of &s;trong holds; and to the de&s;troying of ev|ery thing, which &s;tood in the way of their meetne&s;s for glory; that it was, for this purpo&s;e, <HI>&s;harp</HI> and <HI>powerful, as a two edged &s;word.</HI> And knowing this to be God's u&s;ual method, and his &s;olemn engage|ment to his people; he cheerfully commends them to him for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="038515_0008_10124854C616F9A8">Two ideas are contained in the clau&s;e of the text under con&s;ideration, viz. <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Glory.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Grace. "<HI>Which is able to build you up." i. e.</HI> Which is able to keep you from falling, until you &s;hall be pre&s;ented &s;potle&s;s before the throne of his glory with exceeding joy. Which is able to pre&s;erve your whole &s;oul and body blamele&s;s unto the day of Chri&s;t, and which <HI>will</HI> do it. This clau&s;e in the text &s;eems to refer to the power and efficacy of God's Spirit, with the word, to keep and prepare his chil|dren for heaven. But the divine efficiency in this matter is exerted in a way, which is con&s;i&s;tent with the agency of the creature in the &s;ame thing. This is an idea of importance to be kept in view, that the divine &s;overeignty, and creature agency, (with the nece&s;&s;ity of means in order to ends,) are perfectly con&s;i&s;tent. If God work in his people to <HI>will,</HI> and to <HI>do,</HI> of his own good plea&s;ure, it is that they may work out their own &s;alvation with fear and trembling. Therefore, the clau&s;e of the text under con&s;ideration, implies their own vigorous activity in being built up. According to Jude, ver. 20, 21. "<HI>But ye, beloved, building up your&s;elves in your mo&s;t holy faith, praying in the Holy Gho&s;t, keep your&s;elves in the love of God.</HI>" And many are the divine precepts, which demand the &s;ame; &s;uch as, "<HI>Strive to enter in at the &s;trait gate;" "The kingdom of heaven &s;uffereth violence, and the vio|lent take it by force.</HI>" It implies their per&s;evering in religion. "<HI>He that endureth to the end, the &s;ame &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI>" It implies their growth in grace. "<HI>The path of the ju&s;t is as the &s;hining light, which &s;hineth more and more unto the perfect day.</HI>" The water of grace not only abides in them a well of water, but is <HI>&s;pring|ing up</HI> unto everla&s;ting life. It implies their benev|olent cultivation of harmony among them&s;elves. "<HI>My dove, my undefiled is one." "That they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they may be one with us.</HI>" It implies their faithful di&s;|po&s;ition to &s;upport, and to improve the ordinances
<PB N="11" REF="038515_0009_10124820AB0BE1D8">
of the Go&s;pel. "<HI>Walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamele&s;s." "Watching daily at my gates, and waiting at the po&s;ts of my doors.</HI>" It im|plies their remaining &s;teadfa&s;t in the faith. "<HI>Rooted and grounded in the truth." "Not carried about with every wind of doctrine by the &s;light of men, and their cun|ning craftine&s;s, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</HI>" It accordingly implies their taking heed, and being aware of fal&s;e teachers; marking and avoiding tho&s;e who make divi&s;ions contrary to the doctrines of grace. Paul in our context had been warning the Ephe&s;ians again&s;t &s;uch impo&s;tors; and then commends them to God, in hopes of their being built up, as in the text. This circum&s;tance forms an <HI>antithe&s;is</HI> between their being &s;educed by impo&s;tors; and their being built up. The latter, therefore, implies their with|&s;tanding &s;uch characters. And Paul was &s;en&s;ible, not only that God was able to build up his cho&s;en, but that he had engaged to do it; that Chri&s;t's &s;heep &s;hall hear his voice, and follow him; that he will give unto them eternal life; that they &s;hall never peri&s;h; neither &s;hall any pluck them out of his hands; that a &s;tranger they will not follow; for they know not the voice of a &s;tranger. Thus <HI>grace</HI> is compri&s;ed in the encouragement in the text. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Glory in heaven</HI> is al&s;o compri&s;ed. "<HI>And to give you an inheritance, among all them, who are &s;anctifi|ed." i. e.</HI> An inheritance in heaven, among the gen|eral a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t born; among the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect. This is the ble&s;&s;ed re&s;ult of their being built up; of their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing and per&s;evering in religion. This is the in|heritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, re&s;erved in heaven for all, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto &s;alvation. This inheritance of the &s;aints in light, compri&s;es the mo&s;t glorious excellencies; which are, entire free|dom from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and &s;in; perfect conformity to God; being made perfect in pure and holy love;
<PB N="12" REF="038515_0010_10124858B9139280">
holy and uninterrupted pre&s;ence of God, and of the Lamb; and the ble&s;&s;ed and holy &s;ociety of angels, and of the &s;aints. It contains nothing plea&s;ing to carnal hearts; for it is a holy and benevolent happi|ne&s;s. It affords to holy &s;ouls a perfect &s;atisfaction in God's likene&s;s; in beholding his glory &s;hining in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and reflected from all his works. It is a glorious and eternal re&s;t from all the labors and trials of time and &s;en&s;e; and a free and uninterrupted participation of the river of God's plea&s;ures. And it probably will compri&s;e an endle&s;s progre&s;&s;ion in knowledge; in &s;trength of benevo|lence; and con&s;equently in happine&s;s. This is but an hint of the inheritance in the text. This was the prize, which Paul had in view; this the crown of glory, which animated him in all his perils and dan|gers, and which he de&s;ired that others likewi&s;e &s;hould &s;ee and &s;ecure. This world, he viewed as nothing compared with it. To obtain this prize, he forgot the things, which were behind; reached to them, which were before; and pre&s;&s;ed through all occur|ring difficulties. And, at the affecting moment of parting from chri&s;tian friends, he could think of noth|ing more comforting, than to commend them to God, and to the word of his grace, confiding in God's a|bility and faithfulne&s;s to meeten them <HI>for,</HI> and finally confer upon them <HI>this ble&s;&s;ed inheritance.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now attend to &s;ome</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AND now, my friends, how far may I be permitted to adopt the words of Paul, in our text and context? You will excu&s;e me, if I deviate from my u&s;ual meth|od of improvements; and attend to the ideas, which pre&s;ent circum&s;tances naturally &s;ugge&s;t. God, in his holy Providence, has afforded me opportunity to la|bor in the Go&s;pel, in this place, for a number of years. But now it appears that I have no further call to remain among you. The cau&s;e of this &s;epa|ration
<PB N="13" REF="038515_0011_10124823306C2DE0">
is well known. And the day is coming, when it will appear, whether there be any thing criminal in the conduct of tho&s;e, who have occa&s;ioned it in withholding my &s;upport. My judgment concurs with the re&s;ult of the Rev. Council, that the intima|tions of Providence, relative to my temporal &s;upport here, call me to leave this place. Here I &s;hall leave this part of the &s;ubject, after one remark, viz. that I have no hard thoughts of my friends, in this place, for not making greater exertions for my &s;upport and continuance among them. I apprehend their exer|tions were as great, and as per&s;evering, as duty de|manded. The Lord graciou&s;ly reward them, in crowning &s;imilar exertions with better &s;ucce&s;s in &s;ome other, and better Pa&s;tor!</P>
<P>As to my faithfulne&s;s among you, I have nothing of which to boa&s;t. My con&s;cience, however, te&s;tifies that I have &s;ought your be&s;t intere&s;t; and have en|deavored to declare to you all the coun&s;el of God; that I have &s;et before you the way of life, and the way of death, as exhibited in God's word; and al&s;o the motives there furni&s;hed to induce you to pur&s;ue the one, and avoid the other. But with many im|perfections I have, doubtle&s;s, been attended. I pray God to forgive them; and reque&s;t you to draw over them the veil of candor.</P>
<P>So far as I have explained to you the Sacred Ora|cles, and &s;et before you the truths of heaven, I en|treat you that (from a &s;acred regard to the authority and the grace of Jehovah, and from a regard to your own immortal intere&s;t,) you &s;olemnly attend to them. Forget not that we are probationers for eternity; that we are here, but for a few days, to cultivate a temper, and form a character, according to which we mu&s;t receive our eternal de&s;tiny. You have heard, in the former part of this day, how <HI>every one of us &s;hall give an account of him&s;elf to God;</HI> and, among other things, I of my mini&s;try among you; and you how you have improved it. And God only knows
<PB N="14" REF="038515_0012_1012485AAFF23350">
whether we &s;hall ever meet again, till that eventful period.</P>
<P>And now, &s;eeing we mu&s;t part, I leave with you my be&s;t wi&s;hes for your happine&s;s; my cordial de|&s;ires for your &s;alvation. But <HI>what you mu&s;t be,</HI> in or|der to obtain &s;alvation, you have often been inform|ed; nor will one &s;oul obtain it without this meet|ne&s;s. But what will be your pro&s;pects without the Go&s;pel? Paul, in our text, commends his brethen to God, <HI>and to the word of his grace.</HI> He left them un|der the full enjoyment of the ordinances of grace. Happy, indeed, could I leave you, (&s;eeing I mu&s;t leave you,) in the enjoyment of the&s;e privileges! A|las, here lies the difference! You are become de&s;|titute of them. What &s;hall I &s;ay to you concerning this?</P>
<P>My Fellow Mortals of this vicinity, Is the Go&s;pel of the grace of God nothing to you? Is it nothing to enjoy it? Nothing to be deprived of it? And noth|ing to de&s;pi&s;e and reject it? If you remain de&s;titute of the Go&s;pel, mark my words, this place will be|come notorious for impiety and wickedne&s;s. Then what will become of your children, and the ri&s;ing generation here? How &s;hall you be able to meet their &s;ouls at the bar of God? And what will become of your own immortal intere&s;t? O, if you have any re|gard for the good of &s;ociety; and e&s;pecially for the good of your &s;ouls, and tho&s;e of your children, then be entreated &s;peedily to unite with the Church in this place to obtain and &s;upport a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t. Depend on it, it is your duty, and your weighty in|tere&s;t. The go&s;pel mini&s;try is the in&s;titution of heaven. It is the mean of &s;alvation. And, if reject|ed, your &s;alvation is lo&s;t! O intere&s;ting thought! Can you, without trembling, read the language of Chri&s;t to his amba&s;&s;adors, <HI>He, who receiveth you, re|ceiveth me; but he, who de&s;pi&s;eth you, de&s;pi&s;eth me; and he, who de&s;pi&s;eth me, de&s;pi&s;eth him, who &s;ent me?</HI> If any of you be found among tho&s;e, who reject this
<PB N="15" REF="038515_0013_101248259ED82228">
gracious in&s;titution of heaven, what have you to ex|pect? Will Chri&s;t wink at your impiety; di&s;pen&s;e with his &s;olemn in&s;titutions; and &s;tate <HI>other</HI> and <HI>low|er</HI> terms, with which you may be plea&s;ed to comply? Let rea&s;on judge. If you mean to conduct with any degree of wi&s;dom, then &s;peedily obtain and improve the privileges of the Go&s;pel. Appropriate &s;o much of your intere&s;t, as is nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e; and deprive not your &s;ouls of all the ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel only to &s;ave a pittance of worldly gain. You will now view me as di&s;intere&s;ted upon this part of the &s;ub|ject; and will, therefore, permit me to u&s;e plainne&s;s of &s;peech. Can a handful of that, which the Apo&s;|tle &s;tyles <HI>filthy lucre,</HI> do that for you, which the Go&s;|pel of the grace of God can do? Can the trifling &s;um, which you may &s;ave in refu&s;ing to &s;upport the Go&s;pel, procure you a &s;afe retreat at death? Can it open for you the gates of bli&s;s beyond the grave? Or &s;ecure you a glorious immortality when the earth is di&s;&s;olving in flames? How much can it do for you in &s;ickne&s;s; in death; in the judgment day; and in hell? Will riches profit you in the day of wrath? Will it not be a mi&s;erable &s;aving, to &s;ave the co&s;t of a preached go&s;pel, at the expen&s;e of your &s;ouls, of heaven, and of enduring eternal burnings? Say not the&s;e inquiries are har&s;h. They are &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;e|rious truths.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider on whom you are dependent for tempo|ral intere&s;t; whether God cannot be&s;tow liberally upon you, if you improve it for him; whether be|ing guilty of the ingratitude and impiety of prefer|ring a trifle of intere&s;t to all the ble&s;&s;ings procured by Chri&s;t; yea, whether robbing God in tithes and of|ferings be the &s;afe&s;t way to &s;ecure the bounties of Providence. At your lei&s;ure plea&s;e to turn to Hag|gai, i.4&mdash;11. and to Malachi, iii.8, 9, 10, where you will find &s;omething to the purpo&s;e upon this idea. Then read Paul's writings upon the &s;ubject, in vari|ous of his Epi&s;tles; particularly 1 Cor. ix.1&mdash;14.
<PB N="16" REF="038515_0014_1012485D5F7C12E8">
Gal. vi.6, 7, and 1 Tim. v.17, 18. In the&s;e &s;crip|tures you may learn your duty as to the &s;upport of the Go&s;pel; and may learn al&s;o the cur&s;e of God, which lies on tho&s;e, who rob him in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to the character of your mini&s;|ter, whom you may choo&s;e; will you prefer a man, who will &s;eek, not your &s;ouls, but to obtain your tem|poral intere&s;t? And who will &s;eek honor from men in the neglect of faithfulne&s;s? Will you choo&s;e one, who will daub with untempered mortar; heal wounds &s;lightly; and cry peace, where God &s;ays there is no peace? Are not our natural hearts full ready enough to deceive us, without the fatal a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;mooth preaching? Alas, how many among men have their hearts depicted in the following in&s;pired hint; "<HI>Who &s;ay to their &s;eers, &s;ee not, and to their prophets, prophe&s;y not unto us right things; &s;peak unto us &s;mooth things, prophe&s;y deceit. Cau&s;e the Holy one of I&s;rael to cea&s;e from before us.</HI>" The fal&s;e prophets in I&s;rael of old were very popular; for their &s;mooth preaching &s;oothed and plea&s;ed the carnal heart. But the true prophets were, for their fathfulne&s;s, hated and put to death. "<HI>I hate him,</HI>" &s;ays Ahab of Micaiah, "<HI>for he never prophe&s;ieth good of me, but evil.</HI>" Chri&s;t &s;ays, "<HI>The world hateth me, becau&s;e I te&s;tify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</HI>" And the truth of this they de|mon&s;trated in putting him to death. How many viewed Paul as an enemy becau&s;e he told them the truth? And how many thou&s;ands, upon this princi|ple, have been put to death? But can it be your wi&s;|dom, or for your intere&s;t, to have the &s;olemn truths of heaven &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e the view of them af|fords pain? How long will the pain, in this way, be deferred? Will it not ere long, fall, with an hun|dred fold weight, upon you? Can any wi&s;h to be confirmed in fatal deception? Will not &s;mooth and fal&s;e teachers ingulf them&s;elves and their votaries in ruin? Let Chri&s;t decide it. "<HI>If the blind lead the blind, both &s;hall fall into the ditch.</HI>" Which &s;urgeon
<PB N="17" REF="038515_0015_101248277493C338">
would you prefer? the one, who &s;oftly heals the &s;urface of your wound, and carele&s;sly leaves your life in imminent danger? Or the one who benevo|lently performs the painful operation of probing it to the bottom, and &s;aves your life, by effecting a thorough cure? Alas, "<HI>The children of this world are wi&s;er in their generation, than the children of light.</HI>"</P>
<P>But, know that you are faithfully warned! I mu&s;t rid my&s;elf of the blood of your &s;ouls. Permit me, now to remind you, perhaps for the la&s;t time, that unle&s;s you do, with humble and penitent hearts, commend your&s;elves to God, and to the word of his grace, by prizing and improving the Go&s;pel; you will fail of heaven; you will be found, at la&s;t, on the left hand; you will be treated as Go&s;pel de&s;pi&s;ers; and will &s;ink in endle&s;s woe. With this warning I mu&s;t bid you adieu.</P>
<P>My young Friends, who are in the morning of your days; What &s;hall I addre&s;s to you, on this oc|ca&s;ion? Will you not lay to heart the things, which have been &s;ugge&s;ted, and which you have often heard? If parents, and tho&s;e, who are advanced in age, in too may in&s;tances, neglect them, yet will not you attend to them, and &s;et better examples? I did expect to &s;pend my days with you. But Providence forbids; and I mu&s;t &s;ubmit. I have e&s;teemed you as an important cla&s;s of people. I think I have de|&s;ired, and &s;ought your be&s;t intere&s;t. And I &s;till wi&s;h your temporal, but e&s;pecially your eternal pro&s;perity. But permit me, once more, as your friend, to remind you, that you are environed with &s;nares, which ruin thou&s;ands. Your danger, while out of Chri&s;t, is great beyond de&s;cription. And, probably, it is not le&s;&s;ened by your pre&s;ent pro&s;pects with re&s;pect to the Go&s;pel. God grant that you may e&s;cape the dan|gers which attend you, and &s;peedily &s;ecure a ble&s;&s;ed immortality. In order to this, be &s;ober minded. Remember your Creator in the days of your youth. Cultivate true piety. Follow not the multitude to

do evil. Dare to break out from the fa&s;cinating charms of popular vice; and to be &s;ingular for Chri&s;t. Do not go down to endle&s;s mi&s;ey for the &s;ake of the multitude, who are goin<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. E&s;|cape the vices of the times. Walk in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ths of religion, of virtue and peace. Before the fa&s;cinating cup of plea&s;ures reaches your lip, <HI>pau&s;e</HI>; con&s;ider who beholds you; what he demands; and what con&s;equences will follow. And may you be wi&s;e to avoid the evil, and to choo&s;e the good. My labors with you will not prove &s;o indifferent a matter, as &s;ome may have viewed them. If I have been un|faithful, the con&s;equence mu&s;t fall with dreadful weight upon my own head; but if faithful, as I hope, in &s;ome good degree, you will find my admini&s;tra|tion here, (to your joy, or horror,) a &s;avor of <HI>life,</HI> or of <HI>death.</HI> God grant it may be the former; and that, though we mu&s;t now part, and I mu&s;t bid you adieu, we may be prepared for an happy meeting in a better world.</P>
<P>And, now, my Brethren, and Beloved of the Church; it is devolved upon me to addre&s;s to you my Farewell. &mdash; Is this po&s;&s;ible? Is it a reali|ty? Or, is it not a dream? We cannot wake, and find it to be the latter. It is the former. Painful is the &s;cene, the di&s;&s;olution of the intere&s;ting relation between us!</P>
<P>What can I now &s;ay, but in the words of our text, to commend you to God, and to the word of his grace? For he is able, under all your di&s;courage|ments, to build you up, and to give you an inherit|ance among all them, who are &s;anctified. I hope you are intere&s;ted in that cele&s;tial trea&s;ure. God has afforded us opportunity to form and cultivate an endearing acquaintance with each other; to walk, hand in hand, for a cour&s;e of years, even ever &s;ince you have been a church. We have mutually waded through &s;cenes of trials. And we have been favor|ed with many privileges and occa&s;ions of joy. And,
<PB N="19" REF="038515_0017_101248298F3520A0">
though we mu&s;t now part, I tru&s;t we have a mutual friend&s;hip formed, which time will never di&s;&s;olve; which death will not obliterate; and which eternity will &s;trengthen and refine. If our friend&s;hip be built on the love of God, this is indeed the ca&s;e. And then, though we mu&s;t be parted in this vale of tears; and God only knows through what trials we may be called to pa&s;s in our different ways; yet one thing we may know, for our mutual con&s;olation, that "<HI>Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things pre&s;ent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, &s;hall be able to &s;eparate us from the love of God, which is in Chri&s;t Je|&s;us, our Lord.</HI>" We &s;hall then meet in that better world, where there will be no more painful &s;epara|tion; where the wicked &s;hall cea&s;e from troubling; where the weary &s;hall be at re&s;t in pure and holy love, in the likene&s;s and ble&s;&s;ed pre&s;ence of our Savior and Lord.</P>
<P>O, let us keep that ble&s;&s;ed world in view. Wan|der not, my brethren, from the path, which leads to it. Be not lo&s;t in this dangerous, intervening wil|derne&s;s. Turn not a&s;ide to the right hand, nor to the left, le&s;t your feet &s;tumble upon the dark moun|tains, and your &s;ouls be utterly lo&s;t.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the means of grace, obtain the ad|mini&s;tration of them, if po&s;&s;ible. Pray to the Lord of the harve&s;t for this ble&s;&s;ing. But remember, that an unfaithful &s;hepherd, (po&s;&s;e&s;s he ever &s;o popular talents,) is, <HI>by far,</HI> wor&s;e than none. Take heed, then, and beware of fal&s;e prophets. Your &s;ituation, will be critical. I fear that &s;ectaries and evil work|ers will be in among you. Errors and damnable her|e&s;ies are becoming prevalent and popular; and ma|ny are their &s;ubtil advocates, who, if it were po&s;&s;ible, would deceive the very elect. Take heed, then, <HI>how</HI> and <HI>whom</HI> ye hear. Receive not &s;chi&s;matics into your hou&s;es. "<HI>Go ye not after them.</HI>" Bid them not God's &s;peed. But mark and avoid them. And
<PB N="20" REF="038515_0018_101248634D8FDCE0">
let us watch and pray always, that we may be ac|counted worthy to e&s;cape all the evils, which are coming upon the earth, and to &s;tand before the Son of Man.</P>
<P>I hope you are <HI>rooted</HI> and <HI>grounded</HI> in the truth. God forbid that I &s;hould flatter you. But I cannot but feel comforted in the apprehen&s;ion that this is the ca&s;e with you, as a church. May the merciful Savior afford you abundance of grace, that you may <HI>feel,</HI> and exhibit much evidence that this is the fact. In order for this, be blamele&s;s and harmle&s;s, the &s;ons of God without rebuke, in the mid&s;t of a crooked and perver&s;e nation; among whom, &s;ee to it, that ye &s;hine, as lights in the world. Have your conver|&s;ation hone&s;t among your fellow men; that, if any &s;peak evil of you, they may be a&s;hamed when they behold your good conver&s;ation of Chri&s;t. Be &s;tead|fa&s;t, and immoveable; always abounding in the work of the Lord. If it be po&s;&s;ible, as much as in you li|eth, live peaceably with all men. At the &s;ame time remember to contend earne&s;tly for the faith once de|livered to the &s;aints. By no means &s;acrifice your re|ligion to carnal peace, or to complai&s;ance; for the wi&s;|dom which is from above, is <HI>fir&s;t pure,</HI> then peaceable.</P>
<P>Should the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t be ever &s;o much neg|lected, or de&s;pi&s;ed, yet favor not this impiety. Be not a&s;hamed of Chri&s;t. Remember Chri&s;t's moving interrogation to his di&s;ciples, when numbers return|ed back, to walk 'no more with him, "<HI>Will you al&s;o go away?</HI>" With melting hearts unite with them in the reply, "<HI>Lord, whither &s;hall we go, but unto thee?</HI>"</P>
<P>"<HI>Let brotherly love continue.</HI>" Let brotherly watch|fulne&s;s abound. Remember your vows, and the laws of Chri&s;t concerning di&s;cipline. Exhort one another daily, le&s;t any be hardened through the de|ceitfulne&s;s of &s;in. Look diligently, le&s;t roots of bit|terne&s;s, &s;pringing up, trouble and defile you. And, O, remember to &s;anctify the &s;abbath! I fear this du|ty will be awfully neglected in this place. If you
<PB N="21" REF="038515_0019_1012482E5EC20600">
have no preaching, I be&s;eech you for&s;ake not the a&s;|&s;embling of your&s;elves together. You have the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t's pre&s;ence, if but two or three meet in his name. Labor, by word, and example, to prevent all profanation of the Lord's day.</P>
<P>And, will you not recollect, and comply with this reque&s;t in the words of Paul. "<HI>Brethren, pray for us.</HI>" Pray for a poor earthen ve&s;&s;el, who is entru&s;t|ed with a commi&s;&s;ion, "<HI>to te&s;tify the go&s;pel of the grace of God.</HI>" Pray for him, who has been your Pa&s;tor. <HI>He needs your prayers!</HI></P>
<P>And now, finally, brethren, farewell; be perfect; be of good comfort; be of one mind; live in love and peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SOME</HI> may inquire, how Mr. Smith came to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his People; &s;eeing &s;uch a cor|diality &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and his Church? The an|&s;wer is, merely for want of &s;upport. The Church, and tho&s;e other per&s;ons, who were di&s;po&s;ed to join with them, for the purpo&s;e of &s;ettling him, were unable to afford him a comfortable maintenance. Tho&s;e who fir&s;t engaged to pay his &s;alary, were but a private &s;ociety, their number very &s;mall, and the &s;um propo&s;ed for his &s;upport very &s;mall. Mr. Smith, neverthele&s;s, was advi&s;ed by the Council, to accept the invitation to &s;ettle; from a con&s;id|eration, that no objection appeared again&s;t his &s;o doing, which would not lie, with equal force, again&s;t their hav|ing the Go&s;pel &s;ettled at all. After &s;everal years, there was a deficiency in the payment of the &s;alary, &s;mall as it was, by rea&s;on, that a number of tho&s;e who fir&s;t engaged, refu&s;ed to pay their proportion. The difficulty was &s;oon increa&s;ed; by the refu&s;al of &s;ome others, who were not plea&s;ed with the place of wor&s;hip; till at length, the &s;itua|tion of the &s;ociety became &s;uch, that it was judged expedi|ent to di&s;continue their u&s;ual practice, of making an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ment, for the collection of the &s;alary. He then (having continued hitherto with much difficulty,) propo&s;ed to call a Council, for advice relative to the expediency of his contin|uing among them. The re&s;ult of which was, that, although a perfect harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Mr. Smith and his Church; and although they had made great and laudable exertions for his &s;upport and continuance among them; yet, ina&s;much as no permanent foundation was laid for his &s;up|port, and &s;o many important openings and calls for Min|i&s;ters appeared, the&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence, in the opinion of the Council, evidently called Mr. Smith from this part of the vineyard.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="038515_0021_10124865DDC2E968">After &s;everal weeks' con&s;ideration, Mr. Smith and the Church unanimou&s;ly viewed it to be their duty to comply with the re&s;ult of Council; which compliance di&s;&s;olved their connection.</P>
<P>The Church, then, unanimou&s;ly voted to pre&s;ent the fol|lowing Addre&s;s to Mr. Smith; which was delivered at the clo&s;e of the Public Exerci&s;es, on the &s;ame day on which the foregoing Sermon was delivered; and is here annex|ed, at the reque&s;t of a number of re&s;pectable characters.</P>

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO THE Rev. ETHAN SMITH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REV. AND DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT having plea&s;ed the All Wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;er of human events, in the cour&s;e of his providence, &s;o to or|der the circum&s;tances of your Mini&s;try and the af|fairs relative to your &s;upport, among&s;t this people, as evidently to point out the expediency of a &s;epara|tion between you and this Church, and your pa&s;tor|al relation to this flock, being con&s;equently di&s;&s;olv|ed by mutual con&s;ent, you will permit the Church, in this public manner, to addre&s;s you on the affect|ing &s;ubject. Painful indeed, Sir, to us, is the &s;epa|ration that has lately taken place; and it is with the deepe&s;t regret, that we now view our&s;elves deprived of the benefit of your faithful admini&s;trations. But, con&s;oling thought! we believe that we &s;hall ever have an intere&s;t in your prayers; and, although you and the members of this Church may probably very &s;oon be &s;eparated in per&s;on; yet we tru&s;t, that we &s;hall not be &s;o in affection; but that the fraternal love and chri&s;tian affection, which has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted ever &s;ince your fir&s;t coming among us, and has been grad|ually increa&s;ing through a term of almo&s;t nine years, will never cea&s;e; but be perfected in the realms of love. We hope, and believe, Sir, that nothing &s;hort of a full conviction of duty, in the minds both of the Pa&s;tor and Church, has, or could have, finally in|duced to an unanimous compliance with the re&s;ult of
<PB N="24" REF="038515_0023_1012486815323D30">
Council; but &s;uch a conviction, we are &s;en&s;ible, ought ever to produce a quiet &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of Providence; and, however weighty the cro&s;s may be, it is no argument again&s;t our cheerfully taking it up and following our Divine Leader. We tru&s;t, dear Sir, that we are not altogether in&s;en&s;ible to the many advantages, which this Church has reaped from your re&s;idence and labors among us; and we would acknowledge, with gratitude, the obligations which you (under God) have thereby conferred on us. With this view, Sir, permit us to take a retro&s;pect of pa&s;t &s;cenes. And in the fir&s;t place, your active and unwearied exertions, at the time of your fir&s;t entering in to us, in a time of general awakening in this place, more particularly, your readine&s;s and a&s;|&s;iduity in in&s;tructing the ignorant, alarming the &s;e|cure, guiding inquirers, e&s;tabli&s;hing the doubtful and comforting the feeble minded; in connection with that ea&s;y, unaffected and accommodating addre&s;s, &s;o peculiarly your own; your generous &s;acrifice of an overture, in a di&s;tant place, larger than could be ex|pected from our &s;mall number; and your taking the charge of this flock, in the face of a powerful oppo|&s;ition, evidence a love and attachment, on your part, which we would gratefully notice. Since your &s;et|tlement, your plain, powerful, and demon&s;trative &s;train of preaching, your fervent prayers, your pa|thetic and moving addre&s;&s;es, at the celebration of the Lord's Supper; your readine&s;s, at all times, to vi&s;it the &s;ick among your people, and to attend on lectures and conferences, whenever reque&s;ted, thus being in|&s;tant in preaching the word, in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea|&s;on; your wi&s;dom and faithfulne&s;s when pre&s;iding in the Church, and leading them in mea&s;ures de&s;igned and calculated to promote Go&s;pel order and di&s;ci|pline; together with your bold and faithful reproofs; the&s;e are &s;ome of the mo&s;t prominent features in your mini&s;terial character, are gifts by which we have been greatly edified, in the cour&s;e of your mini&s;try, and
<PB N="27" REF="038515_0024_101248352358DBD0">
the unanimity and love of di&s;cipline, &s;o ob&s;ervable in this Church, we e&s;teem as &s;ome of the happy fruits thereof. Furthermore, Sir, we feel our&s;elves com|forted, in a view of the patience and fortitude, with which you have &s;u&s;tained your peculiar trials and embarra&s;&s;ments; your deportment having been &s;o exemplary, through the whole cour&s;e of your min|i&s;try, that not the lea&s;t impeachment of your mor|al conduct has been attempted, by any, the mo&s;t in|veterate of your enemies. The&s;e things we ought to reflect upon, with plea&s;ure and joy, being unfeigned|ly thankful, that we have had &s;o abundant occa&s;ion (though for a much &s;horter &s;ea&s;on than we hoped) to rejoice in your light. We a&s;&s;ure you, dear Sir, that whenever you leave us, you have our fervent prayers, for your&s;elf, your con&s;ort and family; that an effectual door may be opened, in Providence, for your &s;tated and &s;ucce&s;sful labors and honorable &s;up|port in the vineyard of the Lord; where you may prove a happy in&s;trument, in the hand of God's Spirit, of turning many to righteou&s;ne&s;s; and (as your glory and reward) that you may &s;hine, as a &s;tar of the fir&s;t magnitude, forever and ever. Finally, Sir, we a&s;k your prayers for this Church and people, in their bereaved &s;ituation; that we may have grace given us, &s;eriou&s;ly to inquire into the grounds of God's controver&s;y with us; that we may remember how and what we have heard from you, hold fa&s;t, re|pent, be humbled, and do our fir&s;t works; and when God &s;hall have an&s;wered the gracious de&s;igns of this cha&s;ti&s;ement, with re&s;pect to us, that he will &s;end us another Pa&s;tor, after his own heart; under who&s;e mini&s;trations, may we be trained up for the kingdom of glory; and at length, meet you, our beloved Pa&s;|tor, therein, never more to be &s;eparated.</P>
