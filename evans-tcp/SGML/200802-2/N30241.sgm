<HEAD>THE Rev. Mr. <HI>WHITEFIELD</HI>'s ANSWER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My <HI>LORD,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I NEED make no Apology for troubling your Lord|&s;hip with this. As your Lord&s;hip was plea&s;ed to make me the chief Subject Matter of your <HI>la&s;t Pa&s;toral Letter,</HI> I think it my Duty to an&s;wer it in the be&s;t Manner I can.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip is to be highly commended, for the Care you have taken in Watching over the Souls of tho&s;e who are committed to your Lord&s;hip's Charge&mdash; <HI>Luke-warmne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> are the two Rocks, again&s;t which even well-meaning People are in dan|ger of &s;plitting. All ought to be Thankful to that Pilot, who will teach them to &s;teer a &s;afe and middle Cour&s;e.&mdash;I would gladly hope, that <HI>a Zeal for God in the Di&s;charge of your Duty, and a hearty Concern for the Safety of Souls</HI> moved your Lord&s;hip to write.&mdash; The&s;e are the Principles, I tru&s;t, which now excite me to direct this An&s;wer to your Lord&s;hip. And, ble&s;&s;ed be God, that I can write with &s;omewhat of that Love and Meekne&s;s which becomes a Di&s;ciple of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and with all that Humility and Reve|rence, which is due from a Presbyter to a Bi&s;hop of the Church of God.</P>
<P><HI>Lukewarmne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> my Lord, are cer|tainly the Bane of true Chri&s;tianity. I thank your Lord&s;hip again for your kind Cautions again&s;t them. The only Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery is,
<Q>Whether there was any Oc|ca&s;ion for your Lord&s;hip's warning the People of your Dioce&s;s again&s;t running into either of the&s;e Ex|tremes, upon account of any Thing I have either &s;poken or wrote?</Q>
Your Lord&s;hip thinks there was,
<PB N="4" REF="040180_0003_10163308D5A7EE18">
and you quote Pa&s;&s;ages out of my Journal to prove it; if it can be proved, I will ask publick Pardon, both of your Lord&s;hip and Them with all my Heart.</P>
<P>As for your Cautions again&s;t <HI>Lukewarmne&s;s,</HI> I am not much concerned in them. You do not &s;eem to point at me in particular; unle&s;s it is where your Lord&s;hip, (<HI>Page</HI> 10) informs your People. <HI>That a diligent Attendance on the Duties of the Station where|in Providence has placed them, is in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e, the &s;erving of God.</HI> None but tho&s;e who condemn me unheard, can ju&s;tly charge me with affirming to the contrary.</P>
<P>However, I beg Leave to ob&s;erve, that your Lord|&s;hip, (<HI>Page</HI> 8) calls that a very imperfect State of Chri&s;tianity, which is no State of Chri&s;tianity at all. St. <HI>Paul</HI> writing to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> Chap. 13. v. 5. &s;ays, <HI>Examine your &s;elves whether ye be in the Faith, Prove your own &s;elves.</HI> And that they might have a certain Rule, whereby to judge whether they were in the Faith, truly &s;o called, or not, immediately adds, <HI>Know ye not your own&s;elves how that Chri&s;t Je&s;us is in you, except ye be Reprobates?</HI> So that ac|cording to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Rule,
<Q>He that finds, he has hitherto contented him&s;elf with a bare bodily At|tendance upon the Publick Wor&s;hip of God, and following his daily Employment on other Days, and with ab&s;taining from the more gro&s;s and notorious Acts of Sin, and from doing any Hurt or Injury to his Neighbour, and has re&s;ted finally upon the&s;e as the Whole of that Chri&s;tianity requires of him,</Q>
is &s;o far from being in a very <HI>imperfect State,</HI> as your Lord&s;hip is plea&s;ed to affirm, (<HI>Page</HI> 8) that he is in no Stae of Chri&s;tianity at all. No, my Lord, he is a <HI>Reprobate, i. e.</HI> one who at pre&s;ent is out of a State of Salvation, nor can he ever have any A&s;&s;urance that he is in a State of Salvation, till he <HI>Knows that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is in Him, by the Indwelling of his Holy Spirit.</HI> If I have mi&s;taken your Lord&s;hip's Expre&s;&s;ion, I will freely beg your Pardon.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="040180_0004_1016330BC08DC4F8">Another Thing, My Lord, to me &s;eems darkly ex|pre&s;&s;ed in (<HI>Page</HI> 8) (Oh! let not your Lord&s;hip be angry, for indeed I will endeavour to &s;peak with all Gentlene&s;s and Humility) Your Lord&s;hip's Words are the&s;e, <HI>Nor need they any other Evidence be&s;ides tho&s;e</HI> Good Di&s;po&s;itions <HI>they find in their Hearts, that the Holy Spirit of God co-operates with their hone&s;t En|deavours to &s;ubdue Sin and grow in Goodne&s;s.</HI> If by <HI>Good Di&s;po&s;itions,</HI> your Lord&s;hip only means <HI>Good Inclinations or De&s;ires,</HI> I deny <HI>That</HI> to be a &s;ufficient Evidence, that <HI>the Spirit of God co-operates with their hone&s;t Endeavours to &s;ubdue Sin and grow in Goodne&s;s.</HI> For there is a great Difference between <HI>Good De&s;ires</HI> and <HI>Good Habits.</HI> Many have <HI>One,</HI> who never attain to the <HI>Other.</HI> Many have good De&s;ires to &s;ubdue Sin, and yet re&s;ting in tho&s;e good De&s;ires, Sin has always had Dominion over them. A Per&s;on &s;ick of a Fever may de&s;ire to be in Health, but that De&s;ire is not Health it&s;elf. In like Manner many have good Di&s;po&s;itions or De&s;ires to be Good, but that is not Goodne&s;s it &s;elf. And con&s;equently Men need more Evidence than good Di&s;po&s;itions, to prove to them&s;elves or others,
<Q>That the Holy Spirit of God co operates with their ho|ne&s;t Endeavours to &s;ubdue Sin.</Q>
If by Good Di&s;po|&s;itions, your Lord&s;hip means Good Habits wrought in the Heart by the Spirit of God, &s;uch as <HI>Peace, Love, Joy, Long-&s;uffering, Goodne&s;s, Truth,</HI> &amp;c. I then a|gree a Man needs no other Evidence. For the&s;e are the proper and genuine Fruits of the Spirit it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip immediately adds,
<Q>Nor that, per|&s;evering in their Cour&s;e, and praying to God for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and relying upon the Merrits of Chri&s;t for the Pardon of all &s;uch Sins, Failings, and Im|perfections, as are more or le&s;s unavoidable in this mortal State.</Q>
I beg leave to ask your Lord&s;hip, whether this does not favour too much of the common Divinity, viz. That we are to do &s;omething for our|&s;elves; or, in other Words, that we have partly a Righteou&s;ne&s;s of our own, and that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is to make UP the Deficiencies of that Righteou&s;ne&s;s?
<PB N="6" REF="040180_0005_1016330DD8DFEB80">
What el&s;e can your Lord&s;hip Mean, by &s;aying
<Q>That we mu&s;t rely on the Merrits of Chri&s;t, for the Par|don of all &s;uch Sins as are more or le&s;s unavoidable in this mortal State?</Q>
Did Je&s;us Chri&s;t come into the World, My Lord, only to &s;ave us from the Guilt of &s;uch Sins as are more or le&s;s unavoidable in this mor|tal State? The Scriptures every where affirm, <HI>That Man hath no Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own: That there is none Righteous, no not one: That all Our Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s is as filthy Rags</HI>; and that Je&s;us Chri&s;t died not only to &s;ave us from the Guilt of all &s;uch Sins, Failings and Infirmites, as are more or le&s;s unavoida|ble in this mortal State, but from all willful Sins, and al&s;o from that original Corruption, which every Man naturally engendred of the Off-&s;pring of <HI>Adam,</HI> brings into the World with him. I hope I have not mi&s;un|der&s;tood or over&s;trained your Lord&s;hip's Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I come now to your Lord&s;hip's Caution again&s;t <HI>En|thu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> For that I &s;uppo&s;e your Lord&s;hip intended more particularly again&s;t me.</P>
<P>And here, my Lord, I beg leave to ob&s;erve, That, in my Opinion, your Lord&s;hip has by no Means been clear enough in your Definition of the Word <HI>Enthu|&s;ia&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>According to the fair Rules of Writing, was it not fir&s;t Incumbent on your Lord&s;hip to &s;hew, that the Word <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t</HI> had a good as well as bad Meaning: That it &s;ignifies no more than <HI>a Per&s;on in God,</HI> and con&s;equently every Chri&s;tian, in the proper Sen&s;e of the Word, is an <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t</HI>? For St. <HI>Peter</HI> writes, <HI>That to us are given exceeding great and precious Promi&s;es, that by the&s;e we might be Partakers of the divine Nature.</HI></P>
<P>And our Church &s;ays, If we receive the Sacrament worthily, we are one with Chri&s;t and Chri&s;t with us, we dwell in Chri&s;t and Chri&s;t in us. For which &s;he has &s;ufficient Warrant from our Lord's Prayer, John 17.20. <HI>Neither pray I for the&s;e alone, but for them al&s;o which &s;hall believe on Me through their Word.</HI> Ver. 21. <HI>That they all may be one, as thou
<PB N="7" REF="040180_0006_1016331099A08818">
Father art in me and I in thee, that they al&s;o may be one in us.</HI> Ver. 23. <HI>I in them and they in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</HI> Ver. 26. <HI>That the Love wherewith thou ha&s;t loved me, may be in them and I in them.</HI></P>
<P>But indeed your Lord&s;hip's Definition of <HI>Enthu|&s;ia&s;m,</HI> when examined, does not convey any ill Idea at all.
<Q><HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> is a &s;trong Per&s;wa&s;ion on the Mind, that they are guided in an extraordinary Manner, by immediate Impul&s;es and Impre&s;&s;ions of the Spirit of God.</Q>
Had your Lord&s;hip &s;aid, a &s;trong, but Groundle&s;s, Per&s;wa&s;ion, that they are guided in an extraordinary Manner, it would have been to your Lord&s;hip's Purpo&s;e. But to affirm, with|out any Re&s;triction, that a &s;trong Per&s;wa&s;ion that we are guided in an extraordinary Manner by immediate Impul&s;es, is <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> in the wor&s;t Sen&s;e of the Word, when your Lord&s;hip your&s;elf &s;ays, (<HI>Page</HI> 54)
<Q>There is no doubt but God, when he plea&s;es, can work upon the Minds of Men by extraordinary In|fluences,</Q>
to me &s;eems a little incon&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip proceeds thus.
<Q>And this is owing chiefly to the Want of di&s;tingui&s;hing aright between the ordinary and extraordinary Operations of the Holy Spirit. The extraordinary Operations were tho&s;e by which the Apo&s;tles and Others, who were entru&s;ted with the fir&s;t Propagation of the Go&s;pel, were enabled to work Miracles, and &s;peak with Tongues in Te&s;timony, that their Mi&s;&s;ion and Doc|trine were from God.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, by extraordinary Operations, your Lord|&s;hip means the &s;ame as being guided in an extraordi|nary Manner ju&s;t above. And if &s;o, according to your Lord&s;hip's own Definition, I am no <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t.</HI> For I never did pretend to the&s;e extraordinary Opera|tions of working Miracles of &s;peaking with Tongues, in Te&s;timony that my Mi&s;&s;ion and Doctrine were from God; I only lay claim to the ordinary Gifts and In|fluences of the Spirit, which your Lord&s;hip. (<HI>Page</HI> 20) &s;ays, '<HI>Still continue.</HI>' And what Need was there
<PB N="8" REF="040180_0007_1016331431BEC1A8">
then, my Lord, that the People of your Dioce&s;e &s;hould be Cautioned again&s;t <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> on my Ac|count?</P>
<P>But your Lord&s;hip farther adds, the ordinary Gifts, However real and certain in them&s;elves, are no other|wi&s;e di&s;cernable than by their Fruits and Effects. Had your Lord&s;hip &s;aid, No otherwi&s;e di&s;cernable to others than by their Fruits and Effects, it would have been right. But if your Lord&s;hip means they are no otherwi&s;e di&s;cernable to our&s;elves, in my Opinion it is wrong: For it is po&s;&s;ible, my Lord, for a Per&s;on to feel and di&s;cern the&s;e ordinary Gifts and Influences of the Spirit in him&s;elf, when there is no Opportu|nity of di&s;covering them to others. For In&s;tance, on Suppo&s;ition that your Lord&s;hip was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit in writing your Pa&s;toral Letter&mdash;might not your Lord&s;hip be &s;en&s;ible of an inward Joy and Complacency, wrought by that &s;elf &s;ame Spirit, which was not then di&s;cernable to others? So likewi&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible for another to feel Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, with the re&s;t of his Fruits, which at that Time may not be di&s;cernable to others; and which they who have never experienced the like may not believe, though a Man declare it unto them. I hope, my Lord, the&s;e Rea&s;onings carry with them their own Evidence.</P>
<P>But to proceed, (<HI>Page</HI> 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.) your Lord&s;hip has taken Pains to collect &s;everal Pa&s;|&s;ages out of the publick Liturgy, to prove the Doc|trine of Regeneration or our New-Birth, to be the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Your Rea&s;on for &s;o doing, appears (<HI>Page</HI> 25)
<Q>to arm your Peo|ple again&s;t any Sugge&s;tions, as if our Church were regardle&s;s of the Doctrine of Regeneration and New-Birth, as if there were Need for any Member of it to &s;eek el&s;ewhere for a more Spiritual Service.</Q>
If this, my Lord, was intended to arm your People again&s;t any &s;uch Sugge&s;tions made by me; indeed your Lord&s;hip does not do me Ju&s;tice. As your Lord|&s;hip, I find, has done me the Honour to peru&s;e my third Journal, your Lord&s;hip may remember this Ob|&s;ervation,
<PB N="9" REF="040180_0008_10163315EAA54450">
(<HI>Page</HI> 39) that, after I had baptized an Adult, I proved the Nece&s;&s;ity of the New-Birth, from the Office of our Church.</P>
<P>In my Sermon upon the <HI>Indwelling of the Spirit of God,</HI> which I have made bold to &s;end your Lord&s;hip with this Letter, you will find I have quoted the Ex|pre&s;&s;ions of our own Church Offices, to prove the Doctrine of the New-Birth, as your Lord&s;hip does in your Pa&s;toral Letter. My con&s;tant Way of preaching is, fir&s;t, to prove my Propo&s;itions by Scripture, and then to illu&s;trate them by the Articles and Collects of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Tho&s;e that have heard me, can Witne&s;s, how often I have exhorted them to be con&s;tant at the publick Service of the Church. I at|tend on it my &s;elf, and would read the Publick Liturgy every Day, if your Lord&s;hips Clergy would give me Leave. What further Satisfaction can your Lord&s;hip require, that I do not &s;ugge&s;t to your Lor&s;hip's Peo|ple,
<Q>as if our Church were regardle&s;s of the Doctrine of Regeneration and New-Birth, and as if there were Need for any Member of it, to &s;eek el&s;ewhere for a more Spiritual Service?</Q></P>
<P>In the following Paragraph, your Lord&s;hip has the &s;ame In&s;inuation, as though I wanted to introduce Ex|tempore Prayer, and to lay a&s;ide the publick Liturgy of our Church. For after your Lord&s;hip had been &s;peaking again&s;t Praying by the Spirit, and af|firming that the Scripture no where tells us, that Prayer is the &s;ingle Work of the Spirit, your Lord|&s;hip &s;ays to your People, <HI>You have great Rea&s;on to be thankful to God for a publick Service prepared to your Hands.</HI> My Lord, I never &s;aid to the Contrary. But does not your Lord&s;hip &s;eem to in&s;inuate at the &s;ame Time, that we are not to depend on the Spirit of God to enable us to pray Extempore, either in Publick or Private? That Prayer is not the &s;ingle Work of the Spirit, without any Co-operation of our own, I readily confe&s;s. But that the Spirit of God does a&s;&s;i&s;t true Chri&s;tians to pray Extempore now, as well as formerly, is undeniable if the Scriptures be
<PB N="10" REF="040180_0009_101633179B439D40">
true. For what &s;ays the Apo&s;tle? <HI>We know not what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it &s;elf helpeth our Infirmities, and maketh Interce&s;&s;ion for us with Groanings, that cannot be uttered.</HI> And this is founded upon a general Promi&s;e made to all Gods People. <HI>Zacharias</HI> 12.10, <HI>I will pour upon the Hou&s;e of</HI> David, <HI>and upon the Inhabitants of</HI> Jeru|&s;alem <HI>the Spirit of Grace and of Supplication.</HI> And I believe, my Lord, we may appeal to the Experience of all true Chri&s;tians, whether or no they did not find the Spirit of Supplication, or a Power of Praying without a Form, encrea&s;e in Proprotion to the encrea&s;e of God's Grace or Holy Spirit in their Hearts. This is all, my Lord, that I pretend to: And where is the Impropriety of this, when your Lord&s;hip confe&s;&s;es in the &s;ame Page, <HI>that the Spirit of God does parti|cularly a&s;&s;i&s;t us, in a due Performance of Religious Offices?</HI></P>
<P>Farther, as your Lord&s;hip &s;eems to deny the imme|diate A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Spirit in our particular Addre&s;&s;es at the Throne of Grace, &s;o your Lord&s;hip &s;eems to deny it al&s;o in our particular Actions.
<Q>In like Manner, your Lord&s;hip &s;ays, we are firmly per&s;waded in general, that we live under the graci|ous Influence of God's Holy Spirit, and that he both excites and enables us to do Good. But that this or that Thought or Action is an Effect of the &s;ole Motion or immediate Impul&s;e of the Spirit, without any Co-operation of our own Mind.</Q>
My Lord, whoever affirmed, that there was no Co-operation of our own Minds, together with the Impul&s;e of the Spi|rit of God? Your Lord&s;hip adds,
<Q>Or that the Holy Spirit, and our natural Conceptions, do re&s;pectively contribute to this or that Thought or Actions, in &s;uch a Mea&s;ure or to &s;uch a Degree; the&s;e are Things we dare not &s;ay.</Q>
Indeed, my Lord, <HI>I dare &s;ay them.</HI> For if there be any &s;uch Thing as a particular Providence, why may we not expect particular Direc|tions from God's Holy Spirit in particular Ca&s;es? Does not our Church, my Lord, teach us to pray, that
<PB N="11" REF="040180_0010_101621E74D7B9578">
God's Holy Spirit may in all Things direct and rule our Hearts? But your Lord&s;hip &s;ays, <HI>We dare not &s;ay this, becau&s;e our Saviour has told us, that we know no more of the working of the Spirit, than we know of the Wind, from whence it commeth or whither it goeth.</HI> Neither need we know any more of them; but you mu&s;t allow, that we know as much. Cannot your Lord&s;hip feel the Wind then? Does not your Lord|&s;hip know when it makes any Impre&s;&s;ion upon your Body? So ea&s;y it is for a Spiritual Man to know when the Holy Spirit makes an Impre&s;&s;ion upon his Soul. Without acknowledging this, all the Expre&s;&s;ions of being led by the Spirit, walking by the Spirit, and &s;uch like, mu&s;t be only &s;o many Words without any real Meaning. Your Lord&s;hip acknowledges, that the Holy Spirit does act in general, and why not in the particular Actions of our Lives al&s;o? For can the One be without the Other? Does it not frequently happen my Lord, that the Comfort and Happine&s;s of our whole Lives depend on one particular Action? And where then, my Lord, is the Ab&s;urdity of &s;aying, that the Holy Spirit may, even in the minute&s;t Circum|&s;tance, direct and rule our Hearts? I have been the more particular, my Lord, on this Part of your Lord|&s;hip's Letter, becau&s;e if this be proved, many of your Lord&s;hip's Objections again&s;t my Journals will fall to the Ground.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 27. Your Lord&s;hip has the following Para|graph.
<Q>God forbid that in this profane and dege|nerate Age, every thing that has an Appearance of Piety and devotion, &s;hould not be con&s;idered in the mo&s;t favourable Light that it is capable of. But at the &s;ame Time, it is &s;urely very proper, that Men &s;hould be called upon for &s;ome rea&s;onable Evidence of a Divine Commi&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>I take it for granted, that I am one of tho&s;e Men whom your Lord&s;hip thinks &s;hould be called upon for &s;ome rea&s;onable Evidence of a Divine Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, my Lord, what rea&s;onable Evidence does your Lord&s;hip require? Did I not receive Letters dimi&s;&s;ory
<PB N="12" REF="040180_0011_10163320935AE520">
from your Lord&s;hip's own Hands to be ordained Prie&s;t? Did I not, when ordained Deacon affirm, <HI>That I was inwardly moved by the Holy Gho&s;t, to take upon me that Office and Mini&s;tration?</HI> Did not my Lord of Glouce&s;ter, when he ordained me Prie&s;t, &s;ay unto me, <HI>Receive thou the Holy Gho&s;t, now committed unto thee by the Impo&s;ition of our Hands, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t?</HI> And is not this, my Lord, a rea&s;onable Evidence that I act by a Divine Commi&s;&s;ion? If this be not true, mu&s;t not all tho&s;e whom your Lord&s;hip, or the other Bi&s;hops ordain, act only by a human Commi&s;|&s;ion? Nay, (to u&s;e the Words of Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI> in his Pa&s;toral Letter) <HI>Mu&s;t not they who are ordained Lie not only unto Man but unto God, by &s;aying,</HI> They are inwardly moved by the Holy Spirit?</P>
<P>If your Lord&s;hip in any wi&s;e di&s;putes my acting by a Divine Commi&s;&s;ion, you di&s;claim your own Divine Right and Authority; nor can you po&s;&s;ibly avoid the Dilemma, of either allowing my Divine Commi&s;&s;ion, or denying your own. After your Lord&s;hip has in&s;i|nuated a Demand for the Evidences of my Divine Commi&s;&s;ion, immediately follows the&s;e Words, <HI>When they tell us of extraordinary Communications they have with God.</HI></P>
<P>If by extraordinary Communications, your Lord|&s;hip means the extraordinary Operations of the Holy Spirit, as working Miracles, and &s;peaking with Tongues; your Lord&s;hip may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, I never pretend to any Such Thing.&mdash;If, by extraordinary Communications, your Lord&s;hip means more A&s;&s;i&s;tances and Comforts from God at &s;ome Times than I have at others, (which is all I mean by extraordinary Communications) I own the Charge. And what is there, my Lord, extraordinary in that?</P>
<P>Again, your Lord&s;hip &s;ays, (<HI>Page</HI> 28) <HI>When they talk in the Language of tho&s;e who have a &s;pecial and immediate Mi&s;&s;ion from God.</HI></P>
<P>And does your Lord&s;hip, and the re&s;t of the Bi&s;hops, ordain any without obliging them fir&s;t to

give good Proofs, that they have a Special Call or Immediate Mi&s;&s;ion from God to the Work of the Mi|ni&s;try? If ever you &s;o do, my Lord, do not your Lord|&s;hip lay Hands too &s;uddenly upon Men?</P>
<P>(<HI>Page</HI> 29.) Your Lord&s;hip writes thus.&mdash;<HI>When they profe&s;s to think and act under the Immediate Guideance of a Divine In&s;piration.</HI></P>
<P>And does not your Lord&s;hip think and act by the &s;ame Rule? Why otherwi&s;e does your Lord&s;hip Pray when you admini&s;ter the Holy Communion, <HI>that God would clean&s;e the Thoughts of our Hearts by the In&s;piration of his Holy Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>(<HI>Page</HI> 31) Your Lord&s;hip &s;ays, <HI>When they &s;peak of their Preaching and Expounding, and the Effects of them, as the &s;ole Work of a Divine Power.</HI></P>
<P>And would your Lord&s;hip have me a&s;cribe any thing in the lea&s;t to my&s;elf?</P>
<P>The Good that is done upon Earth, doth not God do it Him&s;elf? Does not the Apo&s;tle &s;ay, <HI>Not that we are &s;ufficient of our&s;elves to think any thing as of our&s;elves, but our &s;ufficiency is of God?</HI> And where then, my Lord, is the Ab&s;urdity of a&s;cribing the Ef|fects of Expounding and Preaching to the &s;ole Work of a Divine Power?</P>
<P>Again, (<HI>Page</HI> 33) <HI>When they boa&s;t of &s;udden and &s;urprizing Effects as wrought by the Holy Gho&s;t, in Con&s;equence of their Preaching.</HI></P>
<P>Where, my Lord, is the Enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;uch a Pre|ten&s;ion? Has your Lord&s;hip been a Preacher in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> for &s;o many Years, and have you never &s;een any &s;udden or &s;urpri&s;ing Effects con&s;equent upon your Lord&s;hips Preaching? Was this my Ca&s;e, &s;hould I not have Rea&s;on to doubt, my Lord, whe|ther I had any more than a bare human Commi&s;&s;ion? Or might I not take up the Prophet's Lamentation, <HI>Oh my Leane&s;s, my Leane&s;s</HI>! My Lord, the Go&s;pel, like its Author, is the &s;ame Ye&s;terday, to Day and forever; and, if preached as it ought to be, will prick Numbers to the Heart, and extort the Cry of the trembling Goaler, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> as
<PB N="14" REF="040180_0013_1016332541D64A88">
&s;urely Now, as it did Seventeen Hundred Years ago.</P>
<P>The&s;e then are the &s;udden and &s;urprizing Effects, my Lord, I always de&s;ire to have, and heartily pray God your Lord&s;hip and all your Clergy may always &s;ee &s;uch Effects in Con&s;equence of their Preaching.</P>
<P>(<HI>Page</HI> 34) <HI>When they claim the Spirit of Prophecy.</HI></P>
<P>What I have &s;aid about my Succe&s;s, God has been plea&s;ed to fiulfil already. What I have &s;aid about Sufferings, they who without Cau&s;e are my Enemies, are fulfilling daily. And as for the Promi&s;es menti|oned in my Journal, I freely own there are &s;ome Par|ticular Promi&s;es which God has &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed and does &s;till impre&s;s on my Heart, that I verily believe they will be fulfilled.</P>
<P>(<HI>Page</HI> 35.) <HI>When they &s;peak of them&s;elves in the Language, and under the Character of Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t, and even of Chri&s;t him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>If I am not to &s;peak in an Apo&s;tolical Language, why did my Lord of Glouce&s;ter give me an Apo&s;tolical Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Who&s;e Sins thou do&s;t forgive, they are for|given; and who&s;e Sins thou do&s;t retain, they are re|tained.</HI> And I hope, my Lord, u&s;ing the Words which Je&s;us Chri&s;t u&s;ed, is not taking upon me the Character of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>(<HI>Page</HI> 36.) <HI>When they profe&s;s to plant and propo|gate a New Go&s;pel, as unknown to the generality of Mini&s;ters and People in a Chri&s;tian Country.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, my Lord, in one Sen&s;e, mine is a New-Go&s;pel, and always will be Unknown to the genera|lity of Mini&s;ters and People, even in a Chri&s;tian Country, if your Lord&s;hip's Clergy follow your Lord|&s;hip's Directions. For what &s;ays your Lord&s;hip (Page 46.) <HI>I hope that when Mini&s;ters 'Preach to you of Ju&s;tification by Faith alone, which is a&s;&s;erted in the &s;tronge&s;t Manner by our Church, they explain it in &s;uch a Manner as to leave no doubt upon your Mind, whe|ther good Works are a nece&s;&s;ary Condition of your be|ing ju&s;tified in the Sight of God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="040180_0014_10163327BA7FB928">But pray, my Lord, where has the Scripture made good Works a Nece&s;&s;ary Condition of our being ju&s;ti|fied in the Sight of God? St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, <HI>By Grace ye are &s;aved, thro' Faith, not of Works, and that lea&s;t any Man &s;hould boa&s;t; for Eternal Life is the Gift of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI> Your Lord|&s;hip exhorts your Clergy to preach Ju&s;tification by Faith alone, and quotes the 11th Article of our Church, which tells us, <HI>we are ju&s;tified by Faith only, and not for our own Works or De&s;ervings.</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>11</HI>th, <HI>12</HI>th, and <HI>13</HI>th Articles of our Church</NOTE> At the &s;ame time your Lord&s;hip bids them, <HI>explain it in &s;uch a Man|ner as to leave no Doubt upon their Minds, whether good Works are a nece&s;&s;ary Condition of their being ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God.</HI> Your Lord&s;hip, in my Opinion, could not well be guilty of a greater incon|&s;i&s;tency. This, my Lord, is truly a New Go&s;pel. I am &s;ure it is not what the Apo&s;tles Preached; and it is as contrary to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e Doctrine of the Church of <HI>En|gland,</HI> and the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e Tenour of the Go&s;pel, as Light is contrary to Darkne&s;s. Had your Lord&s;hip in&s;i&s;ted on your Clergy's preaching up good Works as a nece&s;|&s;ary Fruit and Con&s;equence, in&s;tead of a nece&s;&s;ary Condition of our being ju&s;tified, your Lord&s;hip would have u&s;ed your Authority aright. For we are com|manded to &s;hew forth or declare to others, that we have a True Faith by our Works. And the 12th Article of our Church &s;ays, <HI>that Good Works follow after Ju&s;tification</HI>; and how then, my Lord, are they <HI>a nece&s;&s;ary Condition of our Ju&s;tification?</HI> No, my Lord, Salvation (if the Go&s;pel be true) is the free Gift of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Faith is the Means whereby that Salvation is applied to our Hearts, and good Works are the nece&s;&s;ary Fruits and Proof of that Faith.</P>
<P>This, my Lord, is the Doctrine of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, This is the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and it is becau&s;e the generality of the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> do not Preach this Doctrine, that I am

re&s;olved, God being my Helper, to continue in&s;tant in Sea&s;on and out of Sea&s;on, to declare IT unto all Men, let the Con&s;equence, as to my own private Per|&s;on, be what they will.</P>
<P>As for your Lord&s;hips's blaiming me for ra&s;hly cen|&s;uring the Clergy for their Practice, none are con|cerned but my <HI>Indolent, Earthly-minded, Plea&s;ure-taking</HI> Brethren, (<HI>Page</HI> 39.)

<P>Would Time permit, I could now proceed to &s;atisfy your Lord&s;hip more particularly about the Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Benjamin Seward</HI>; but as that is done in a Letter &s;ent to my Lord of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and publi&s;hed in my la&s;t Journal; and as I am now to embark in a few Hours, I hope your Lord&s;hip will excu&s;e me, if I only add my hearty Prayers for your Lord&s;hip's tem|poral and eternal Welfare, and &s;ub&s;cribe my &s;elf,</P>
