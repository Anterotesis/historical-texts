<P>THE great &s;oul of our beloved Wa&s;hington, has left the world.&mdash;Accounts, not to be di&s;puted, have announced his death.&mdash;It is an event long to be remembered by Americans.&mdash; The melancholy tidings have vibrated on our ears, in &s;adde&s;t accents; they have penetrated our hearts, exciting &s;en&s;ations not to be de&s;crib|ed; and have produced, in copious effu&s;ion, &s;in|cere, but unavailing tears.&mdash;On this day, the anniver&s;ary of that which gave him to his coun|try and to mankind&mdash;the day, which, in honor of his virtues, you were u&s;ed to devote to fe&s;ti|vity and joy; we are met, for the fir&s;t time, in the hou&s;e of God, to deplore our lo&s;s of him;&mdash; to weep over his urn; and to collect &s;uch in&s;truc|tions from his death, as the &s;olemn event is &s;uited

<P>With the millions of America, therefore, we unite in paying an affectionate tribute of re&s;pect to the memory of this fir&s;t of Americans;&mdash;this friend of religion, of liberty, and of man.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the pious intentions and duties of the day, the text under con&s;ideration has been &s;elected. For this purpo&s;e it appears &s;trictly ap|propriate, and furni&s;hes excellent in&s;truction.</P>

<P>The &s;everal important doctrines &s;ugge&s;ted in the text, if taken into con&s;ideration and treated ab&s;tractly, would be found worthy of our mo&s;t &s;erious attention; but this our time, and other exi&s;ting circum&s;tances, will not admit. I &s;hall therefore unite doctrinal di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ub|ject, with its application to that mournful event, we this day recogni&s;e and lament.</P>
<P>In the execution of this de&s;ign, let us con&s;ider, the greatne&s;s of the lo&s;s and affliction we have &s;u&s;tained, in the death of the illu&s;trious General, and late Pre&s;ident, Wa&s;hington;</P>

<P>Point out the proper method of improving the important, mournful event.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t intention has its accompli&s;hment in our taking a ju&s;t view of the character, &s;ervices, and influence of this great man; and of the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of our country.</P>
<P>The character of the General is &s;o con&s;picuous in the American hi&s;tory, where his great actions are recorded;&mdash;has been pre&s;ented to our view
<PB N="4" REF="037484_0006_100D19F3F7AFA168">
in &s;uch a variety of engaging forms, in tran&s;ac|tions intimately connected with our fir&s;t inter|e&s;ts and tendere&s;t feelings; and has, ju&s;tly, been &s;o often the &s;ubject of eulogy, that it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary we &s;hould enter into a particular inve&s;ti|gation: and were we to attempt it, the limits of a volume would be found too confined.&mdash; Where al&s;o &s;hould we find the Raphael-hand that could draw it to the life, and pre&s;ent it to our view in all its plea&s;ing attitudes and glowing colours?</P>
<P>Leaving, therefore, this arduous &s;ervice to a ma&s;ter's hand, we &s;hall only attempt a &s;ketch.</P>
<P>In treating of his character, we mu&s;t briefly touch on his hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>General George Wa&s;hington was the third &s;on of an opulent gentleman of Virginia, who traced his de&s;cent from the elde&s;t of two brothers of the name, who had migrated to that country from York or Lanca&s;hire, in Great Britain, about the year 1660. They were men of property when they left their native land, and &s;ecured to them|&s;elves, as &s;ettlers in this, the u&s;ual advantages attendant on wealth and re&s;pectability of charac|ter; which both them&s;elves and de&s;cendants ap|pear to have uniformly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The General was born on the eleventh day of February, old &s;tile, in the year 1732. While very young, he began to manife&s;t that greatne&s;s of mind, and excellency of di&s;po&s;ition, which have &s;ince &s;hone &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly in his charac|ter. His companions at &s;chool have declared, that they never di&s;covered in him any profanity in language, or indecency of behaviour; and
<PB N="5" REF="037484_0007_100D19F82EF30718">
that they often &s;uffered reproof, from their pa|rents or guardians, by the compari&s;on which was drawn between his conduct and theirs.</P>
<P>Though he did not enjoy the advantages of a collegiate education, yet, he was furni&s;hed, un|der a competent tutor, with an opportunity of gaining acquaintance with cla&s;&s;ical learning. But &s;o &s;trong was his inclination for the mathemat|icks, that his genius could not be long confined to the &s;tudy of the dead languages. In mathe|matical &s;cience he was &s;aid to have made con&s;id|erable progre&s;s; as well as in whatever belongs, in general, to an Engli&s;h education. That logick and oratory mu&s;t in &s;ome early part of his life, have engaged his &s;erious attention, is very natu|rally concluded, from the cla&s;&s;ical purity and el|egance of his &s;tile; and from the clear, conci&s;e, and nervous manner of his rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>A re&s;pectable te&s;timony has been given to his improvement in &s;cience, by the emulation with which &s;everal of the mo&s;t eminent American &s;eminaries conferred on him their literary ho|nors.</P>
<P>When he began his military career we are not quite certain; as the hi&s;torical accounts and other &s;ources of information which have been con&s;ulted, re&s;pecting this and &s;ome other con&s;equent tran&s;ac|actions of his life, are not &s;o particular as could be wi&s;hed. By &s;ome accounts, it is &s;aid he had acted as an adjutant; and by others, that he rai&s;ed a company of volunteers in the capacity of cap|tain, for the defence of the Virginia frontiers. In either of the&s;e ca&s;es, and both are probable, he mu&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="037484_0008_100D19F9B27F0C38">
have entered on military &s;ervice when very young, and made rapid advances; for we find him with the rank of major at the age of 21, when, in the year 1753, he was &s;ent by governor Dinwiddie to negociate with the French commandant on the Ohio. In the following year, he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as colonel commandant on the Ohio &s;ta|tion, by the total defeat of a party of French &s;ent to di&s;lodge him; and by his &s;ub&s;equent de|fence of the unfini&s;hed fort Nece&s;&s;ity, again&s;t a force va&s;tly &s;uperior to his own. In the year 1755 he was pre&s;ent at the battle of Mononga|hela, and acted as aid to general Braddock. Had his prudent advice and courageous offer been ac|cepted by that haughty, confident commander, it is probable the fatal and &s;hameful defeat of the day would have been prevented: and had not his courage and conduct, at the head of the provincial troops, interpo&s;ed, after the fall of Braddock, the remainder of the Briti&s;h regulars mu&s;t have been cut to pieces.</P>
<P>Having thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, in early life, an exalt|ed character for courage, prudence, patrioti&s;m, and wi&s;dom, mature beyond his years, he reti|red at, or before, the peace of 1763, from mili|tary employments; at lea&s;t, from the regular &s;ervice; but was generally, if not always, a re|pre&s;entative of the people in the provincial a&s;|&s;embly. In this &s;tation, the principles of liberty, of government, and of general law, mu&s;t have &s;eriou&s;ly employed his mind.&mdash;By this previous acquaintance with both military affairs and legi&s;|lation, Divine Providence gradually prepared him for tho&s;e high &s;tations which he afterwards fill|ed:&mdash;for
<PB N="7" REF="037484_0009_100D19FB375BEBB8">
the important part he acted in the re|volutionary war, and in the e&s;tabli&s;hment, or|ganization and government of the&s;e United States.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of Virginia, &s;en&s;ible of his abilities and worth, appointed him one of that band of worthies, which compo&s;ed the congre&s;s of '74; and on the 15th of June 1775, congre&s;s ap|pointed him commander in chief of the Ameri|can armies.</P>
<P>Under his conduct they &s;upported, amid mani|fold di&s;advantages, an arduous and &s;ucce&s;sful op|po&s;ition, during an eight years war, again&s;t the &s;uperior force of Briti&s;h and auxiliary veterans, headed by their able&s;t generals. By him they were conducted to victory and renown.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed the defen&s;ive, revolutionary war, which terminated in the acknowledged inde|pendence, freedom, and peace of his country, he voluntarily re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion, on the the 23d of July, 1783, into the hands from which he received it; and retired, covered with glory, to the peaceful &s;hades of private life.</P>
<P>But within the compa&s;s of four years, the exi|gencies, and call of his country, again requiring him to engage in national tran&s;actions; he be|came a member, and pre&s;ident of the convention, which framed the con&s;titution of the United States: And on its adoption by the States, was, by the unanimous voice of the citizens, called to the fir&s;t magi&s;tracy in the union. Having fin|i&s;hed the con&s;titutional term of his appointment, as Pre&s;ident; a &s;econd unanimous vote, re-elect|ed him to the &s;ame important office; and had he not voluntarily retired, a third, or fourth, in all
<PB N="8" REF="037484_0010_100D19FDE7A477D0">
probability, had this been requi&s;ite, would have continued him in it to the end of his life.</P>
<P>Long worn in the fatigues and dangers of the field, and pre&s;&s;ed with the weighty, complicated cares of government, he mu&s;t, at this time of re|tirement, have &s;ighed for repo&s;e; e&s;pecially at his advanced &s;tage of life, and when all the charms of relative and dome&s;tic enjoyment united their influence to invite him to his plea&s;ing home.</P>
<P>His intention and hope therefore, were, no doubt, fully expre&s;&s;ed in the declaration made to the citizens at large, in his farewell addre&s;s:&mdash; "Of appearing no more in a public character." But once more his country called, and he obeyed. The ho&s;tile appearance in Europe, re&s;pecting A|merica:&mdash;Threats and in&s;ults, menacing a blow, rou&s;ed all the patriot and &s;oldier in his brea&s;t. He &s;purned the thoughts of ea&s;e, of indulgence, and, as it were, even the infirmities of age, when the honor and &s;afety of his country required exertion! &mdash;Again he accepted the command of the Ameri|can forces; again he appeared terrible in arms!</P>
<P>In the cares, rather than the dangers, of this new appointment (for the la&s;t were not permit|ted,) he &s;uffered, at the high di&s;po&s;al of all-ru|ling Heaven, the arre&s;t of death, on the 14th of December, 1799.&mdash;With manly fortitude he met the awful &s;ummons; and in the 68th year of his age, complacently &s;urrendered his &s;oul into the hands of his Creator and his God.</P>
<P>By a regular view of his character, we &s;hall di&s;cover in him, a man endowed with &s;uperior gifts of nature&mdash;a great general&mdash;an able &s;tate&s;|man, and ju&s;t magi&s;trate&mdash;a <HI>true</HI> patriot&mdash;a man of exalted virtues, and religion.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037484_0011_100D1A012E20BF10">The firmne&s;s and vigor of his con&s;titution, the manly, dignified appearance of his per&s;on, the comprehen&s;ion of his mind, the correctne&s;s of his judgment, and his per&s;ua&s;ive powers in eloquence, or written addre&s;&s;es, were at once happy and honorable to him&s;elf, and eminently u&s;eful to mankind.</P>
<P>He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in an eminent degree, the quali|ties of a great general;&mdash;wi&s;dom and fore&s;ight in forming his plans; promptne&s;s and courage in the execution. Impenetrable &s;ecrecy watch|ed over his military councils; prudence and quick di&s;cernment directed his choice and confi|dence in agents. The influence he exerted over an heterogeneous body of raw, inexperienced &s;ol|diers, of which his army generally con&s;i&s;ted, &s;o as to unite and in&s;pire them with patience and fortitude, under all the wants, and di&s;advantages they &s;uffered; and to face with courage the en|emy, &s;uperior in numbers, di&s;cipline, and the means of war, whenever a proper occa&s;ion of|fered, was truly admirable. Add to this, his &s;killful manoeuvring, &s;o as to deceive, delay, or elude the foe; and the command he maintained over him&s;elf. In dangers and &s;ufferings he was not unrea&s;onably depre&s;&s;ed; in victory not ar|rogant, vainly elated, or &s;ecure. He was the eye, the ear, the heart, the &s;oul of the army: Ever attentive, ever watchful:&mdash;Alive to the wants and &s;ufferings of the &s;oldiers; but re&s;olute to re&s;train their irregularities and check their in|&s;olence.&mdash;As a general, he was honored by the great Frederick.</P>
<P>He gave an earne&s;t of his great abilities as a
<PB N="10" REF="037484_0012_100D1A036B909E50">
&s;tate&s;man, by fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ting the idea of a federal government, in the circular letter he addre&s;&s;ed to the governors of the different &s;tates, at the clo&s;e of the war: And he eminently di&s;play|ed them, during his eight years admini&s;tration, as Pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>
<P>They appear by his recommendations to the national legi&s;lature; by the prudent u&s;e he made of the power lodged in his own hands; by his appointments to office; and by his &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of in&s;urrection. But the highe&s;t honor is done to his character as a &s;tate&s;man, by his placing this country in a &s;tate of neutrality, when the flames of war were kindling in Europe; by the effect|ual mea&s;ures he took to counteract the attempts of tho&s;e who would have drawn or plunged us into them; and by the excellent maxims and coun&s;els of his farewell addre&s;s.</P>
<P>So ju&s;t was his admini&s;tration, that he might, with the greate&s;t propriety, have addre&s;&s;ed the citizens of the United States, in the language of Samuel, the Prophet and Judge of I&s;rael: "Who&s;e ox have I taken; who&s;e a&s;s have I taken; whom have I defrauded; or whom have I oppre&s;&s;ed?"</P>
<P>But to his country he was <HI>more</HI> than ju&s;t:&mdash; He was the true, the generous patriot. For her welfare he con&s;ecrated the &s;ervices of his early youth, of his manly prime, and of his declining years. For the arduous &s;ervices of commander in chief of the armies, and pre&s;ident of the Uni|ted States, during a term of near twenty years, he received no pecuniary compen&s;ation: His gen|erous &s;oul refu&s;ed it! He &s;ought no rewards but
<PB N="11" REF="037484_0013_100D1A06741FDB58">
the rewards of virtue! He laboured, only to render his country free, independent, and happy!&mdash;What opportunities had he at the head of the army, for ama&s;&s;ing wealth, had this been his object? And what rewards might he not have received had he yielded, like the traitor Arnold, to the overtures which propo&s;ed his betraying the cau&s;e of liber|ty?</P>
<P>His conduct uniformly ju&s;tified the declaration he made on his appointment as general, that "in a&s;&s;uming the character of a &s;oldier, he did not relinqui&s;h that of a citizen." That unre|mitted care he exerci&s;ed to pre&s;erve the military, in due &s;ubordination to the civil power, reflects the highe&s;t honor on his public character; and proves the genuinene&s;s of his patrioti&s;m.&mdash;He might, like Cromwell and others, have &s;urround|ed the legi&s;lature with armed men; have obtru|ded on their deliberations to awe them with his pre&s;ence; and, to effect the purpo&s;es of ambi|tion, have amu&s;ed the people with the cry of liberty and republicani&s;m. But &s;o far was he from adopting &s;uch mea&s;ures; that when by de&s;igning men, through the medium of the army's wants, rebellion and violence were exci|ted, and were ready to bur&s;t forth with de&s;truc|tive fury; he, to his immortal honor, ri&s;ked all his popularity with the &s;oldiers and their love of him; exerted all his eloquence and influence; interpo&s;ed his authority, and&mdash; prevented the evil. It was his intention that his country &s;hould be <HI>really</HI> free, and that the &s;ource of power &s;hould be pre&s;erved pure. He well knew, that when &s;oldiers dictate to a &s;tate, her liberties are gone.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037484_0014_100D1A08C6787E80">The conduct he ob&s;erved toward the Briti&s;h admiral, Lord Howe, and the adjutant-general Patter&s;on; and to the French amba&s;&s;ador, Genet, &s;hows, that however he would patiently bear <HI>per|&s;onal</HI> injuries, or in a dignified manner overlook &s;lights of a <HI>private</HI> nature, he would &s;uffer none which affected the honor of his <HI>country.</HI> His concern for her honor, and happine&s;s, extended to future ages&mdash;hence that valuable legacy, his farewell addre&s;s.</P>

<P>His mode&s;ty ca&s;t a &s;oftening &s;hade over all his other virtues.

<P>But let us now con&s;ider the rea&s;ons which re|quire our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the divine will, manife&s;ted in this event.</P>
<P>A forcible one occurs at fir&s;t view: It is the act of God:&mdash;Of him, who has a &s;overeign right and propriety in, and over all worlds, and all their inhabitants:&mdash;Of him who&s;e goodne&s;s is in|finite.</P>
<P>Had the ruffian hand of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, or the en|emies to liberty, perpetrated, or but attempted, his death; thou&s;ands, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, millions, of &s;words would have been drawn by patriotic A|mericans, and in their hands have flamed for vengeance. But to oppo&s;e the will of heaven, or murmur at its accompli&s;hment, is impiety, folly, and madne&s;s. In the acts of God, unerring wi&s;dom, united with ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s, directs all events, both of the moral and natural world.</P>
<P>Wa&s;hington was to America the valuable gift of God: he had a right to re&s;ume his own gift at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The event we mourn is the common lot of man: "The Fathers, where are they? And the Prophets, do they live for ever?"</P>
<P>To the good man, death is de&s;irable: It ter|minates the toils and &s;ufferings of life; and leads to perfect bli&s;s&mdash;to never-ending joys.</P>
<P>Our beloved patriot had lived to a good old

age. Had he lived much longer, he mu&s;t, ac|cording to the common cour&s;e of nature, have &s;uffered tho&s;e infirmities and decays, which im|pair, if not de&s;troy the comfort and u&s;efulne&s;s of life; and rob it of re&s;pectability. Greatne&s;s in ruins is a mournful &s;ight: To him&s;elf, therefore, <HI>this</HI> might be the mo&s;t de&s;irable time for his de|parture.</P>
<P>To which we may add, he had for his own ho|nor, and the honor of his country, completed a long cour&s;e of great and dignified actions, with|out tarni&s;hing his reputation; in &s;uch a manner as to give him full rank, if not precedence, a|mong the great characters of ancient or modern times;&mdash;and to make his example u&s;eful to fu|ture ages. Did Greece boa&s;t of Solon, Ari&s;tides, Leonidas, Timoleon, Epaminondas, and Aratus? or Rome, of Romulus, the Bruti, Cincinnatus, Fabius, Scipio, the Antonines, or Cato? Does modern Europe glory in her Frederick, Gu&s;ta|vus Adolphus, Marlborough, Hampden, or Sid|ney:&mdash;as heroes, &s;tate&s;men, or patriots?

<P>The cau&s;e in which this great man engaged, remains the &s;ame: and equally, we tru&s;t, the care of heaven.

objects in God's moral government.&mdash;While the&s;e are pre&s;erved inviolate; and while we ac|knowledge the interpo&s;ition of the Deity, &s;uppli|cate his throne, fear his judgments, render thanks for his mercies, and honor religion by a temper and conduct corre&s;pondent to its principles,&mdash;as this great patriot and our ance&s;tors have done; and as the body of our citizens, I tru&s;t, are di&s;|po&s;ed to do;&mdash;America will remain the object of divine care and favor.&mdash;If, therefore, one ho|nored agent is removed, another will be rai&s;ed up to fill his place; to catch, as it were, his mantle, imbibe his &s;pirit, and &s;tand forth, under God, the guardian of our lives, liberties and laws.&mdash;'Twere impiety to repo&s;e in any creature, though an Archangel, our ultimate confidence for &s;afety and defence.</P>
<P>We have, indeed, as individuals, been found wanting in our returns of gratitude, for the man|ifold and excellent ble&s;&s;ings conferred on us by Providence. In too many in&s;tances we have abu&s;ed our privileges; and perhaps&punc; in &s;ome, have given that honor to the &s;ervants, which was due only to their Lord! This may be a rea|&s;on for their removal;&mdash;not out of di&s;plea&s;ure to them, nor ultimately to us; but for our hum|bling:&mdash;that we may feel our dependence on God, fear his holy name, and henceforth make his everla&s;ting arm our tru&s;t.</P>
<P>This is an affecting con&s;ideration. Under conviction of its truth, well may we be dumb with religious awe in the divine pre&s;ence as pen|itents: and with &s;ilent admiration and gratitude contemplate his goodne&s;s, long-&s;uffering, and mer|cy; by which we are continued in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion

Not to be affected on this occa&s;ion, would argue want of &s;en&s;ibility&mdash;want of virtue: But to &s;et bounds to our grief, and turn its tide into a pro|per channel, is the work of rea&s;on and religion.</P>

<P>This example will teach the &s;enator wi&s;dom, the &s;tate&s;man ju&s;tice and magnanimity; the pa|triot genero&s;ity, the &s;oldier heroi&s;m, and the cit|izen, virtue. It will &s;how to our approving un|der&s;tanding and con&s;cience, that the foundation of every truly great character is laid in per&s;onal virtue, and a &s;incere regard to religion. So true are the words of the Poet:

<L>Nor honor, faith, nor truth to &s;uch belong.&mdash;</L>
<L>Who can be right, who&s;e life is in the wrong?</L></Q>
To the ri&s;ing generation, e&s;pecially, this exam|ple is recommended. Let the American youth, fired with the laudable ambition of excelling in all that is great, virtuous, and amiable, improve

<P>How, as rational, accountable creatures, &s;hould we be concerned to meet, in a becoming manner, the unavoidable, grand event,&mdash;the change of death? What exertions &s;hould we not make, to obtain an intere&s;t in the ju&s;tifying righteou&s;ne&s;s, atoning blood, and living interce&s;&s;ion of the adorable Redeemer, who is the re&s;urrection and the life; and to be found faithful in his &s;ervice at the all-important moment, when we are &s;um|moned away to the world of &s;pirits? That then, when we are bidding a long and la&s;t farewell to mortal things, and our eyes are clo&s;ing in death; we may be comforted with the a&s;&s;urances of di|vine love;&mdash;that while we are pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;hades of that dark valley, where nature's light is extingui&s;hed; the reviving rays of hea|venly glory may dawn on our departing &s;pirits, and the bright &s;cenes of perfect bli&s;s open to our view.&mdash;So &s;hall we e&s;cape the wrath and puni&s;h|ment which await the wicked; and enter into the joy of our Lord; into the &s;ublime, perma|nent joy of heaven, which no time can wa&s;te, nor created power de&s;troy.</P>
<P>This happine&s;s is re&s;erved for all the righteous; &mdash;of this the departed &s;pirits of the ju&s;t already partake.</P>
<P>On this principle, therefore, we found the la&s;t article of improvement, we have on this oc|ca&s;ion contemplated to make, of that &s;olemn event which this day commands our attention. Let us not indulge hopele&s;s grief concerning the pious dead.&mdash;'Tis the command of revelation; the rea&s;on is obvious and conclu&s;ive. Was our

<P>Then let us cheerfully &s;ubmit to the afflicting di&s;pen&s;ation which has removed him from us; and in the contemplation of his perfect happine&s;s and endle&s;s re&s;t, dive&s;t our minds of every repi|ning thought; and of every &s;en&s;e of di&s;advan|tage we have &s;u&s;tained by his death.</P>
