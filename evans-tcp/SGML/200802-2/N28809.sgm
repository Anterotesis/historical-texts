<Q>THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE crime, which is this day to be capitally puni&s;hed, is a direct violation of the law of love to our neighbour. The words read will not, therefore, it is pre&s;umed, be thought un|&s;uitable for the theme of a di&s;cour&s;e, on the pre&s;ent very &s;olemn and affecting occa&s;ion. They are very conci&s;e and &s;imple in expre&s;&s;ion; but their meaning is great, their contents are weighty and extremely intere&s;ting to individuals and to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The true meaning of the law of love to our neighbour in its nature and extent;</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The rea&s;onablene&s;s and obligation of this law; and, then, make improvement by way of in|ference and application.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> I am to &s;how the true meaning of the law of love to our neighbour in its nature and extent.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed God to create man in his own moral likene&s;s; to endue him with knowledge to under|&s;tand the divine character and his own duty; with rectitude of mind and holy principles of action, that he might obey his Maker, and be the object of his complacency. On the under&s;tanding and heart of
<PB N="6" REF="038410_0004_1011DB252B6D8DC0">
man the Lord wrote two comprehen&s;ive and unalter|able laws, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Love to God, and Love to men.&mdash;The&s;e were to him the rule and covenant of life. Accordingly, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who taught the will of God in perfection, when this que&s;tion was put to him, "Which is the great commandment of the law?" an&s;wered, "Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind. This is the fir&s;t and great commandment. And the &s;econd is like unto it, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf. On the&s;e two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."</P>
<P>Although by the &s;inful lap&s;e of man our nature is &s;o depraved, that we are prone to tran&s;gre&s;s, and our moral powers are &s;o debilitated, that we cannot ren|der perfect obedience; and, in boundle&s;s compa&s;&s;ion, a Saviour is provided, to redeem us from &s;in and the cur&s;e of the law; yet Je&s;us Chri&s;t "came not to de|&s;troy the law, but to fulfil it."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 17.</NOTE> He came not to lower its demands and weaken its obligation but to obey it perfectly for man; not to excu&s;e any from the duties enjoined, nor to tolerate the lea&s;t &s;in, but to exemplify its perfect morals, and aid us in &s;incere and univer&s;al imitation of him&s;elf. This law, there|fore, is now our rule of life. Sincere obedience to it is a &s;ervice mo&s;t rea&s;onable, u&s;eful, and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Love is one of the primary affections of the mind, and always inclines us to will and to do whatever ap|pears to be right and good. It is the oppo&s;ite of ha|tred, which invariably prompts to &s;in, unle&s;s it be directed again&s;t &s;in it&s;elf. Love to God exhibits it|&s;elf in reverence and wor&s;hip, admiration and prai&s;e, obedience and gratitude, confidence and tru&s;t. When this affection is in proper exerci&s;e, and the divine character is rightly apprehended, it becomes compla|cency,
<PB N="7" REF="038410_0005_1011DB26B914D6B8">
and is productive of joy and delight. Love to our neighbour expre&s;&s;es it&s;elf in good will and kindne&s;s, truth and ju&s;tice, righteou&s;ne&s;s and charity. And when real amiablene&s;s of character is perceived, love &s;urpa&s;&s;es the ordinary bounds of benevolence, and is refined into complacency, the re&s;ult of which is harmony and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Let us now attend particularly to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> table of the law, love to our neighbour, which enjoins all relative and &s;ocial duties, and prohibits all the con|trary vices. The&s;e precepts, which are &s;ix in num|ber, and begin with the fifth in the decalogue, have re&s;pect to all &s;tations and relations in life, and extend as well to the de&s;ires of the heart, as to the out|ward actions. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> enjoins on children all due honour and obedience towards their parents; and with equal rea&s;on, on parents, all proper affection and care towards children. It requires all &s;uitable re&s;pect to &s;uperiors, kindne&s;s to equals, and conde|&s;cen&s;ion to inferiors, and prohibits every &s;entiment and action incon&s;i&s;tent with the&s;e virtues. The <HI>&s;econd</HI> is, Thou &s;halt not kill; and forbids every di&s;po&s;ition and action, which tends to injure the life and health of our neighbour, with all hatred, malice, and re|venge; and requires a &s;incere de&s;ire and endeavour to pre&s;erve his life and health, and to promote his happine&s;s. The <HI>third</HI> prohibits the violation of the marriage covenant and every kind and degree of lewdne&s;s, and requires cha&s;tity in heart, &s;peech, and behaviour. The <HI>fourth</HI> is, Thou &s;halt not &s;teal. By this command, all the&s;t, burglary, robbery, fraud, counterfeiting the currency and legal writings, and whatever tends unju&s;tly to deprive our neighbour of his property, is ab&s;olutely prohibited; and the oppo|&s;ite virtues, by parity of rea&s;on and full implication,
<PB N="8" REF="038410_0006_1011DB284A7788F0">
are &s;trictly commanded. The <HI>fifth</HI> utterly forbids all perjury, lying, fal&s;ehood, and prevarication; and implicitly enjoins on every man, to &s;peak the truth to his neighbour in conver&s;ation and in witne&s;s bearing, whether he &s;peak without or under the ob|ligation of an oath. The <HI>&s;ixth</HI> aims directly at the heart. It forbids coveting the property and enjoy|ments of our neighbour; and implies that we be contented with &s;uch things as we have by the allot|ments of Providence, and can procure by hone&s;t in|du&s;try. The coveting, which is a violation of the divine law of love to our neighbour, is an earne&s;t de&s;ire to po&s;&s;e&s;s and enjoy the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and com|forts of other people, without regard to equity and ju&s;tice. To covet in this &s;en&s;e is &s;inful; and it prompts to unrighteous mea&s;ures to obtain the things coveted. It induces deception, fraud, &s;tealing, and the mo&s;t atrocious crimes. Thus, to covet is the corrupt fountain whence flow tho&s;e injurious vices, which frequently &s;courge individuals and &s;ociety. This is the bitter root from which &s;pring up fraud, inju&s;tice, &s;tealing, robbery, and, &s;ometimes, murder. According to the confe&s;&s;ion of the unhappy convict before us, all his crimes, which have more directly procured pro&s;ecutions, pri&s;ons, puni&s;hments (and I may add, the gallow&s;) may be traced to this &s;ecret, fruitful, and corrupt &s;ource. There is a &s;en&s;e in which it is virtuous to covet, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to "covet earne&s;tly the be&s;t gifts." We may ardently de&s;ire to excel in goodne&s;s and u&s;efulne&s;s, and for this purpo&s;e, to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by endowments. But this de&s;ire hav|ing for its objects &s;piritual things and the benefit of men, is the very oppo&s;ite in its nature and effects to that &s;inful lu&s;ting, or coveting, after evil things, and things to which we have no ju&s;t right.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="038410_0007_1011DB2B44D87A80">
That &s;uch, as above &s;tated, is the true meaning of love to our neighbour, is evident from a great num|ber of pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;acred &s;criptures. To cite one only may be &s;ufficient to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.&mdash;"Render therefore to all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due, cu&s;tom to whom cu&s;tom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour. Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou &s;halt not kill, Thou &s;halt not commit adultery, Thou &s;halt not &s;teal, Thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s, Thou &s;halt not covet; and if there be any other command|ment (that is, enjoining relative duties) it is briefly comprehended in this &s;aying, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 7, 8, 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of the text will be more per&s;picuous, whil&s;t we attend to the <HI>nature</HI> of love. It is a true character given in &s;cripture of the Deity, that he "is a God of peace, and not of confu&s;ion:" and a more perfect one, when it is &s;aid, "God is love." Hence all moral duty, all religion, which is de&s;igned to make men good, holy, and happy like God, is &s;ummed up in love. The moral law is a tran&s;cript of the divine mind, and con&s;i&s;ts &s;ummarily in love to God and love to men. According to this &s;tatement, it is evi|dent that love to our neighbour is of the &s;ame nature and kind, as the love of God to men. He hath for men a love of benevolence and a love of complacency, which he expre&s;&s;es, as they are by moral character qualified to receive.</P>
<P>I will now di&s;tinctly con&s;ider love to our neigh|bour in both the&s;e operations.</P>
<P>The love of benevolence intends a di&s;po&s;ition to do good to our neighbour, and an actual exhibition of the inward purpo&s;e. There mu&s;t be both the willing
<PB N="10" REF="038410_0008_1011DB2F48ACB400">
mind and the actual performance of good deeds. True benevolence is therefore totally oppo&s;ed to all hatred, violence, inju&s;tice, and unkindne&s;s in di&s;po|&s;ition and behaviour. "Love worketh no ill to his neighbour."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 10.</NOTE> Nor mu&s;t this exerci&s;e of benevolence be the re&s;ult merely of a ca&s;ually unruffled &s;tate of the pa&s;&s;ions, nor be limited by particular occa&s;ions and circum&s;tances; but it mu&s;t be the prevailing bias and the habitual frame of the mind and heart. Nei|ther is it dependent on the temper and treatment of others; but it is the mo&s;t prominent and permanent feature of the &s;oul towards our neighbour, which both really and apparently includes and gives com|plexion and life to all the other features. A per&s;on truly benevolent would feel a di&s;po&s;ition to do good and to make his fellow creatures happy, though not one of them were di&s;po&s;ed to receive his kindne&s;s, or to be grateful for his favours. In this, as he ought, he re&s;embles God, who cau&s;eth his &s;un to ri&s;e and his rain to fall, as well on the evil, as on the good, as well on the ungrateful, as on the thankful. Other|wi&s;e, the benevolence of a per&s;on would be mea&s;ured by the worthine&s;s or unworthine&s;s of the objects. In this ca&s;e, multitudes would not have the lea&s;t be|nevolence &s;hown them, for they are wholly unworthy.</P>
<P>But as one perfection of God cannot be in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e infinite, as to infringe on any one other perfec|tion, &s;o neither does chri&s;tian benevolence interfere with the proper exerci&s;e of ju&s;tice, even when it in|flicts pain and puni&s;hment. Love to others, to &s;oci|ety, to our&s;elves, may require us, in a due cour&s;e of law, to abridge the natural and civil liberty of indi|viduals, to inflict puni&s;hment on offenders, and even to take away the life of malefactors, who&s;e abu&s;e of liberty, vicious conduct, and continuance in life are
<PB N="11" REF="038410_0009_1011DB31E85009B0">
dangerous to the peace and happine&s;s of individuals and the community. The law of love commands, and government is obliged, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to pre|&s;erve the peace and order of &s;ociety, and the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of life, liberty, and property to individuals. Per&s;ons the mo&s;t humane and benevolent, are, &s;ome|times, con&s;trained by the law, by a &s;en&s;e of duty, of ju&s;tice, and benevolence to puni&s;h offenders, for whom they have pity and compa&s;&s;ion, and whom they would joyfully relieve, could they do it in con|&s;i&s;tence with equity and fidelity. Love to &s;ociety, to the great body of the people, frequently requires the execution of ju&s;tice on individuals in pains and penalties. From this view it is evident that the love of benevolence due to our neighbour, is of the &s;ame nature with the di&s;po&s;ition and moral character of God, who is infinite in benevolence.</P>
<P>The love we owe to our fellow-men re&s;embles that of Deity in another re&s;pect, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> in di&s;tingui&s;hing be|tween the objects of kindne&s;s and the objects of com|placency. And it is only when love is con&s;idered, as complacency, that it is limited by the character of the per&s;ons loved. To this operation of love I will briefly &s;peak.</P>
<P>Love becomes complacency only when the object is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of good and amiable moral qualities. As God, who &s;catters ble&s;&s;ings on the evil and the good, hath complacency only in the good; &s;o chri&s;tians, however affectionate and charitable they may be, can have complacency only in the virtuous and good, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch amiable qualities, as an&s;wer to their ideas of moral beauty. There is no relig|ious harmony between the virtuous and vicious, though the latter as well as the former may po&s;&s;e&s;s many agreeable qualifications. Natural and acquired
<PB N="12" REF="038410_0010_1011DB34ED6AC138">
accompli&s;hments may engage our natural affections and give us real &s;atisfaction, as &s;ocial beings: but without moral goodne&s;s there can be no religious complacency and mutual delight. "For what fellow|&s;hip hath righteou&s;ne&s;s with unrighteou&s;ne&s;s? and what communion hath light with darkne&s;s? and what concord hath Chri&s;t with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?" We are liable, however, through ignorance and error in judgment, to withold our complacency from &s;ome to whom it is due, and to be&s;tow it on others really unworthy.</P>
<P>The qualifying words in our text, as <HI>thy&s;elf,</HI> are de&s;igned to expre&s;s the quality, rather than the de|gree of love. To love our neighbour as our&s;elves, is, to exerci&s;e towards him the &s;ame kind of tender affection, benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, and friendly care, which we do for our&s;elves. This con&s;truction an|&s;wers all the purpo&s;es, and pre&s;erves the force and perfection, of the precept, without involving any ab|&s;urdity, or di&s;couraging human exertions. Some per&s;ons, perhaps, may love &s;ome other, as much, as they do them&s;elves, in &s;ome re&s;pects at lea&s;t: but this &s;en&s;e is not enjoined, I conceive, as the rule and mea&s;ure for all men. The &s;ame kind of attention, care, and endeavour, which we generally have for our own per&s;on, character, intere&s;t, and happine&s;s be|ing exerci&s;ed towards our neighbour, is to love him as our&s;elves. In this light I under&s;tand the precept.</P>
<P>The <HI>extent</HI> of this law under con&s;ideration next de|mands attention.</P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour hath taught us by the &s;tory of the man, who fell among thieves, that we are to look upon all men as our neighbours, and e&s;pecially,
<PB N="13" REF="038410_0011_1011DB37E5CB00C8">
when we have any concerns with them, and oppor|tunity to &s;how them kindne&s;s. Our Lord, on hav|ing this que&s;tion put to him, "Who is my neigh|bour?" an&s;wered, "A certain man went down from Jeru&s;alem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which &s;tripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance, there came down a certain prie&s;t that way; and when he &s;aw him, he pa&s;&s;ed by on the other &s;ide. And likewi&s;e a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and pa&s;&s;ed by on the other &s;ide. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was; and when he &s;aw him, he had compa&s;&s;ion on him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and &s;et him on his own bea&s;t, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow, when he depart|ed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the ho&s;t, and &s;aid unto him, Take care of him, and what|&s;oever thou &s;pende&s;t more, when I come again, I will repay thee. Which now of the&s;e three, thinke&s;t thou, was neighbour to him that fell among the thieves? And he &s;aid, he that &s;hewed mercy on him. Then &s;aid Je&s;us unto him, go, and do thou like|wi&s;e."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke x. 30, &amp;c.</NOTE> It is worthy notice, that the unfortunate man was a Jew; the prie&s;t and Levite, who neglect|ed him, were of the &s;ame nation; but the real neigh|bour was a Samaritan; and &s;uch alienation and en|mity &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Jews and Samaritans, that the former had no dealings with the latter. It is here clearly &s;et forth, that we are to con&s;ider all men as our neighbours, and that we are bound by the law of love, to aid and relieve the nece&s;&s;itous, whenever we have opportunity and ability.</P>
<P>All this is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with &s;elf-defence,
<PB N="14" REF="038410_0012_1011DB3A90610DE0">
and even taking the life of an enemy, when he will not cea&s;e to behave inimically on ea&s;ier terms. I &s;peak here only of public enemies and private a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins and robbers, who threaten, or endeavour, to de&s;troy life. Ordinary per&s;onal enemies &s;hould be the objects of our love of benevolence. Our Lord commands, "Love your enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e you and per&s;ecute you." If we love our friends only, what reward have we? Do not even publicans and &s;inners the &s;ame?</P>
<P>Our affection may be proportioned to the nearne&s;s and dearne&s;s of relations. But I will not enlarge on this idea. One ob&s;ervation farther ought not to be omitted. It is the command of Chri&s;t, "What&s;o|ever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye the &s;ame unto them." In this precept, there is no exception of per&s;ons or characters. What&s;oever ye would, or could, in rea&s;on and propriety, de&s;ire men to do unto you, in pre&s;ent, or change of, circum&s;tan|ces, that do ye unto them; that is the rule of your duty, the mea&s;ure of your conduct towards them.</P>
<P>Should a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary laws of &s;ociety, &s;uffering puni&s;hment for evil doing, &s;ay, I would that men take no cognizance of my crimes, or that they relea&s;e me from pri&s;on, and excu&s;e me from puni&s;hment, it would be altogether unrea&s;on|able. The offender ought to query thus, Would I, that men &s;hould do unto me and mine, as I have done unto them and theirs? Would I, that they &s;hould follow &s;uch pernicious practices to my detriment, as I have followed to their injury? And were I in their place and they in mine, would I, or could I, in rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, relca&s;e them from pri&s;on and puni&s;hment, and &s;uffer them to pur&s;ue their vile and
<PB N="15" REF="038410_0013_1011DB3D2D987858">
mi&s;chievous career without interruption? Such que|ries properly made and an&s;wered, are &s;ufficient to &s;ilence the complaint of oppre&s;&s;ion to &s;ufferers for evil doing, and to &s;uppre&s;s, in criminals under pun|i&s;hment, that &s;pirit of hatred and revenge again&s;t government and people, which they too frequently indulge and exhibit. Their revenge &s;hould turn upon them&s;elves and their own evil practices, and not on &s;ociety, which is obliged in &s;elf-defence, and in love to others, to di&s;cipline them by the civil law, "which is made, not for a righteous man, but for the lawle&s;s and di&s;obedient."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>There are two e&s;&s;ential properties of love, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> &s;in|cerity and impartiality, which merit &s;ome attention in this place. But they are &s;o far obviou&s;ly implied in the preceding, and I have already been lengthy in explanation, that barely to mention them mu&s;t &s;uffice. I proceed</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To &s;how the rea&s;onablene&s;s and obligation of the law of love to our neighbour.</P>
<P>The <HI>rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of this law appears in its adapta|tion to the nature, powers, condition, and exigencies of man. "God hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on the face of the earth;" and hath given to all the &s;ame general nature and de&s;ti|nation, the &s;ame wants and obligations. We are all members of the &s;ame great family, and are nece&s;&s;arily connected by mutual de&s;ires, attachments, and wants. Our intellectual powers, &s;ocial faculties, and animal propen&s;ities, our condition in the world, our depen|dence on each other, and our exigencies, being in general the &s;ame, it is mo&s;t fit and rea&s;onable that we be under the obligation of the law of good-will and kindne&s;s, of reciprocal affection and aid; and this law is properly expre&s;&s;ed by the words, benevo|lence,
<PB N="16" REF="038410_0014_1011DB3EC425D808">
love, charity. Our nature and condition in this life demand, and our rational and &s;ocial faculties dictate, mutual expre&s;&s;ions of love and kindne&s;s. All the under&s;tanding of man, and all the rea&s;on and fitne&s;s of things, require, approve, and urge this di|vine law of love to our neighbour.</P>
<P>The va&s;t benefit, which re&s;ults from the exerci&s;e of love, and the de&s;tructive evils, which follow the oppo&s;ite, farther prove the rea&s;onablene&s;s of this law. The happine&s;s to individuals, to families, and to all &s;ocieties, which is the genuine fruit of love, is be|yond all calculation and de&s;cription. The full exer|ci&s;e of love towards all our relations, &s;ociety, and the whole family of man, is it&s;elf a &s;tate of happine&s;s, e&s;pecially if it be accompanied by love to God. And when love is the principle, the &s;pring, the rule of ac|tion in all the members of a family, &s;ociety, or world, the whole mu&s;t be mo&s;t plea&s;ed and ble&s;t. There would be no di&s;cord, jealou&s;ies, nor fears; no hatred, malice, nor revenge; no inju&s;tice, fraud, nor pilfer|ing, no violence, oppre&s;&s;ion, nor fal&s;ehood; no cov|eting, di&s;content, nor repining; no intemperance, lewdne&s;s, nor idlene&s;s; no di&s;obedience to parents, neglect of children, nor di&s;re&s;pect to con&s;tituted au|thorities. There would be no need of penal laws, pri&s;ons, and corporal puni&s;hments. Every family, &s;ociety, and the world, would be a heaven in kind.</P>
<P>But on the other hand, what countle&s;s evils, what &s;in and mi&s;ery naturally and nece&s;&s;arily flow from the oppo&s;ite principles and practices, to individuals, to families, and to &s;ociety! Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for a moment, the entire ce&s;&s;ation of love, and the full op|eration of hatred one to another, and of all tho&s;e cor|rupt lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;pring up in the hu|man heart. Every man would covet, and then &s;teal,
<PB N="17" REF="038410_0015_1011DB429939EA90">
or violently &s;eize the things of his neighbour. The more artful and mighty would prey upon the more weak and defencele&s;s. Inju&s;tice and rapine would be the order of every day; and mutual fears, plots, con|tentions, violence, and murder, would be only the more con&s;picuous lines in the horrible portrait. Pa|rents would be again&s;t children, and children again&s;t parents; hu&s;bands and wives would be plagues to each other, and brothers, &s;i&s;ters, connexions, and neighbours, would be mutual tormentors. Even natural affection would cea&s;e to operate under the reign of hatred; friend&s;hip would be unknown; and people would often become murderers of fathers, of mothers, of children, and deadly enemies to all about them on every trivial occa&s;ion. The general con&s;ent and practice would be, to bite and devour one an|other, and the unavoidable con&s;equence would be complicated wretchedne&s;s and de&s;truction. Every family, every &s;ociety, if &s;ocieties properly &s;peaking could &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and the world it&s;elf would be a hell in &s;ort, and a lively picture of the infernal regions. Who doth not &s;ee the boundle&s;s rea&s;on of love to our neighbour, and the nece&s;&s;ity of it to human hap|pine&s;s and moral excellence!</P>
<P>To what has been &s;aid very little need be added, to &s;how the <HI>obligation</HI> of this law on every one of the human race. Its obligation re&s;ults from its rea&s;on|ablene&s;s, its utility, the nece&s;&s;ity of it to the happine&s;s of men, and to the very exi&s;tence of &s;ocial order and civil &s;ociety, and from the authority of God in the command. We have &s;hown the rea&s;onablene&s;s, the utility, and the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a law; its obligation on us, therefore, is manife&s;t and undeniable. While the nature and condition of man &s;hall be, as they now are, &s;o long we &s;hall be indi&s;&s;olubly bound by
<PB N="18" REF="038410_0016_1011DB45A7ADA760">
the law of love. In its very nature it is unalterable and perpetual; for the duties required originate in the eternal rea&s;on and fitne&s;s of things, and in the moral nature, relations, and condition of man. "Till heaven and earth pa&s;s, one jot or one tittle &s;hall in no wi&s;e pa&s;s from the law, till all be fulfilled."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. v. 18. Luke xvi. 17.</NOTE> We mu&s;t, therefore, obey this law of love in the &s;incerity of our hearts, and look by faith to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s, or &s;uffer for|ever the penalty, the ju&s;t puni&s;hment of our tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The obligation of this law appears farther, as it is enjoined by the authority of the eternal God. It is true, he gave the commands becau&s;e they were, and are, replete with rea&s;on and goodne&s;s, mo&s;t &s;uitable and needful. But whatever God commands, whether it be a moral or po&s;itive law, is obligatory on us, and the more &s;o, if po&s;&s;ible, in proportion to the manife&s;t rea&s;on and fitne&s;s of the law. I will only add, on this article, they who pre&s;ume to contemn this authority and di&s;obey this law, mu&s;t, one day, experience, unle&s;s they repent of &s;in and believe in Chri&s;t, what it is to fall under the wrath of God and the cur&s;e of this law without remedy or hope.</P>

<P N="2">2. The tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of this law renders nece&s;&s;ary dreary pri&s;ons, pecuniary and corporal puni&s;hments in a cour&s;e of civil law, and occa&s;ions va&s;t infelicity and expen&s;e to the peaceable and virtuous members of &s;ociety.

Idlene&s;s and vice, complaints and groans, oaths and imprecations, mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s, would there no longer wound our &s;en|&s;ibility and pain our hearts. No more would wretch|ed criminals be doomed to &s;mart beneath the painful &s;courge, nor mount the &s;hameful pillory to bear the public &s;corn, and in their fle&s;h receive the indelible marks of infamy and vice. The now intended u&s;e of yonder fatal gallows might be changed. In&s;tead of a machine to take the precious life, and &s;end a fellow-mortal to the world of &s;pirits, it might be u&s;ed to &s;helter, or to warm, the &s;hivering limbs of poor and virtuous families.

<P N="3">3. Love to &s;ociety joins with &s;elf love in puni&s;h|ing the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of this law. We form the &s;ocial compact, in&s;titute civil government, enact laws, au|thori&s;e judiciary courts, for the great purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving, in peace and &s;afety, our property, our life, our civil and &s;acred rights and privileges. By thus entering into the obligations of civil &s;ociety, we agree mo&s;t &s;olemnly, to aid and defend each other and the whole body again&s;t every one, who &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s on &s;ociety or an individual. We &s;hould at once violate all our &s;ocial and civil obligations, and expo&s;e our&s;elves to rapine and ruin, were we not to ri&s;e again&s;t the criminal invaders of private and pub|lic rights and property. We are bound by love and duty to each individual and the whole community, to &s;upport the order of &s;ociety, and to aid the execu|tion of the laws again&s;t the wicked di&s;turbers of pri|vate per&s;ons and &s;ociety. In the painful ta&s;k of in|flicting puni&s;hment on offenders, we are actuated by love, duty, con&s;cience, and faithfulne&s;s; and ill-will, hatred, and revenge, have no part in this bu&s;ine&s;s. The &s;ame principles, doubtle&s;s, actuate government, which is the people by civil con&s;titution. This con|&s;ideration &s;hould prevent the indulgence and even the ri&s;ing of enmity in the brea&s;ts of criminals again&s;t the government, the legi&s;lature, judicial courts, jurors, and executive officers.

They are governed by hatred to their neighbour, and by tho&s;e ba&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which follow in her train.

The truth is, they are in heart and life the allowed enemies of &s;ociety; and a change of local neighbours and circum&s;tances would prove them &s;uch in every direction. Not love and goodne&s;s, but hatred and inju&s;tice reign in them, and have dominion over them. Cupidity, avarice, revenge, or &s;ome peculiar circum&s;tances, may be the immediate &s;pur, but the principle is hatred, or, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, the ab&s;ence of love gives an open|ing for the operation of the vile and malignant pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P N="5">5. To exerci&s;e and cultivate love to our neigh|bour is of the highe&s;t importance.

for the company of demons in the regions of di&s;cord, hatred, and mi&s;ery. A thorough change only can qualify us for a world of love and happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is va&s;tly important that the &s;ocial duties of love be impre&s;&s;ed on the minds of children and youth. Great care &s;hould be taken by parents and in&s;tructors, to implant the principles of virtue and piety, and to form the di&s;po&s;itions and habits in ear|ly life. Thus educated, there is good ground for hope, that they will re&s;i&s;t the force of oppo&s;ite princi|ples and temptations in riper years. Children &s;hould be encouraged in every virtuous &s;entiment and practice. They &s;hould be ince&s;&s;antly taught to revere the rights of others, and to realize the obliga|tion of love and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P N="7">7. The wilful tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of this command to love our neighbour, are, in that character, totally di&s;|qualified for heaven and happine&s;s. Their di&s;po&s;i|tions and habits are oppo&s;ed to love and holine&s;s.&mdash;They have no moral ta&s;te for intellectual and reli|gious exerci&s;es and enjoyments. It is true, they may de&s;ire happine&s;s and dread mi&s;ery. This is natural. But the bias of the mind, and the prevailing tenden|cy of the &s;oul, are incon&s;i&s;tent with the pure joys and holy employments of heaven. Being under the influence of vicious pa&s;&s;ions and habits, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be mi&s;erable. And were they to be intro|duced to the immediate pre&s;ence of God, and the company of &s;aints and angels, they would feel the horrors and pains of hell: for heaven and hell con&s;i&s;t principally in character and condition, and in the enjoyments and torments thence naturally re&s;ulting. A wicked mind, having all the pa&s;&s;ions and propen|&s;ities raging, but without de&s;ired gratification, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be in mi&s;ery. But on the other hand,

per&s;ons in the full exerci&s;e of love and goodne&s;s mu&s;t infallibly be plea&s;ed and happy. How, then, can the wicked and unholy, who love not their Maker and fellow men, e&s;cape the wrath to come? There is one only method, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>repentance</HI> towards God and <HI>faith</HI> in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. They mu&s;t &s;o repent of all &s;in, as to for&s;ake and hate moral evil, and thoroughly re|form; and they mu&s;t &s;o believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the Son of God and only Saviour, as cordially to ac|cept what he hath done for &s;inners, and &s;incerely conform to his go&s;pel. Chri&s;t is the only way of &s;alvation, the only name given under heaven where|by we mu&s;t be &s;aved.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts iv. 12.</NOTE> God is ready to &s;how mercy, to grant pardon, and to give eternal life to tho&s;e, who &s;incerely repent of their &s;ins, tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, and look for &s;alvation through him. Such repentance and faith include a change of heart, a renovation of the whole man, and the re&s;toration of that moral image of God, which was lo&s;t by &s;in. Thus they are qualified to enjoy heaven, while they are pardoned and ju&s;tified for the &s;ake of the complete atonement and perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. In this way, all people, who hear the &s;ound of the go&s;pel, who read the Bible, have the offer of &s;alvation from &s;in and wrath to come.

You would no &s;ooner unju&s;tly deprive him of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, than you would utterly de&s;troy your own; nor &s;ooner endanger his health, or happine&s;s, or life, than your own. You are bound to do unto others, what&s;oever ye would that they &s;hould do un|to you. Then, "let him that &s;tole, &s;teal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 28.</NOTE></P>
<P>Take heed that you do not increa&s;e your &s;ins and trea&s;ure up wrath by indulging hatred and revenge again&s;t &s;ociety and particular per&s;ons. What can they do to pre&s;erve their peace and property better, than to confine and puni&s;h you? Do you think, gov|ernment wi&s;hes to create unnece&s;&s;ary expen&s;e and trouble? Or that it delights in your confinement and di&s;grace? no; as it did nothing to provoke your fir&s;t offence, &s;o you are di&s;ciplined by the law, only to prevent you and others from farther crimes, and to defend the innocent in the quiet enjoyment of life, liberty, and property.</P>
<P>Beware of coveting the things, which belong to other people. "Thou &s;halt not covet." Suffer me now, once more, to warn and be&s;eech you, to re&s;olve in the pre&s;ence of God, and with prayers for his aid|ing grace, that henceforth you will indu&s;triou&s;ly fol|low

&s;ome hone&s;t calling, and "be content with &s;uch things as you have;" that you will "be diligent in bu&s;ine&s;s, fervent in &s;pirit, &s;erving the Lord."</P>
<P N="3">3. Parents and heads of families &s;hould be reli|giou&s;ly attentive to prepare the ri&s;ing generation for &s;ocial and civil life. Let it be your con&s;tant care, to train them up in the way they &s;hould go, and then you may confidently hope, they will not depart from it in riper years. Some parents, like pious, but faulty Eli, are too indulgent to their children, and do not &s;ea&s;onably and re&s;olutely re&s;train them from vicious practices: and many like him al&s;o, when it is too late, mourn their folly. Some parents err on the other hand, e&s;pecially in re&s;pect to world|ly affairs. You &s;hould be kind and ju&s;t to your children, and to young people under your care, as well as &s;trict and vigilant over them. You &s;hould "not be bitter again&s;t them," nor refu&s;e to give, or pay them, in proper time, what is rea&s;onable and ju&s;t, "left they be di&s;couraged," their innocent emu|lation be cramped, their affections be alienated, and their minds indi&s;po&s;ed to the &s;teady pur&s;uit of profi|table bu&s;ine&s;s. The unhappy criminal before us, has declared to me, in a feeling manner, and with a re|que&s;t, that I would warn parents again&s;t inju&s;tice to their children, that the hard treatment of his father,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith often &s;pake of his mother, and always with affection and re&s;pect. He e&s;teemed her as a kind parent and excellent chri&s;tian.</NOTE> when he wi&s;hed to &s;ettle in a family &s;tate, was one great &s;ource of his early trouble, and the principal cau&s;e of his beginning to &s;teal. Whether we give full credit to this &s;tory, or not, it is an undoubted truth, that the hardne&s;s and inju&s;tice of parents and ma&s;ters towards children and &s;ervants, have very pernicious effects on their minds. Such treatment tends direct|ly
<PB N="30" REF="038410_0028_1011DB64E3799E88">
to counteract a &s;en&s;e of equity, goodne&s;s, and love, and to quench every &s;park of laudable ambition. If you would have tho&s;e under your care grow up and per&s;evere in the exerci&s;e of love to their neighbour, in the full extent of the law of love, you mu&s;t not only teach them their duty by precepts, but you mu&s;t &s;et before them a living example. Then &s;hall your hearts be made glad by the wi&s;dom and virtue of your children and charge.</P>
<P N="4">4. Young people are in&s;tructed by our di&s;cour&s;e. My young friends, you &s;ee the &s;hame and wretched|ne&s;s, which attend on vice, and that "&s;in, when it is fini&s;hed, bringeth forth death." Be &s;olicitous to &s;hun the paths of &s;in, for they lead to de&s;truction. Cultivate a lively &s;en&s;e of love to mankind, and ever act on the &s;tricte&s;t principles of benevolence, truth, and righteou&s;ne&s;s to all people. Dread the fir&s;t &s;tep to any &s;candalous vice, and "ab&s;tain from all appear|ance of evil." Fear God, and keep his command|ments, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the only &s;ure and peaceful way to honour, glory, and eternal happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">5. Let this numerous a&s;&s;embly make application. Every per&s;on is under the obligation of the law of love to God and our neighbour. How have we obeyed this law? Have we loved our neighbour as our&s;elves? Are not many of us guilty concerning our brother? Let us &s;earch and prove our own ways, and re&s;olutely reform whatever we find to be incon&s;i&s;tent with love. Let every one &s;et his face, as a flint, again&s;t prevailing vices. Accept the admoni|tion, which this dying criminal hath de&s;ired might be given, not to neglect public wor&s;hip, and the re|ligious ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith had been very faulty in re&s;pect to public wor&s;hip and the Sabbath, which he lamented. He &s;aw that it kept him igno|rant and hardened and gave him opportunity to contrive and perpetrate wickedne&s;s.</NOTE> Such neglect
<PB REF="038410_0029_1011DB68E5DE7D10">
keeps people out of the way of hearing the word of God explained, and of having their duty inculcated upon them. When people for&s;ake the hou&s;e, profane the day, and neglect the word of God, let them expect that their temptations and their &s;ins will be multiplied, and that God will ca&s;t them off forever.</P>
<P>This day, my hearers, for the fir&s;t time in this town, we &s;ee, as to this world, the clo&s;ing &s;cene of coveting and &s;tealing. God grant there may be none occa&s;ion for another of this kind. But if any pre|&s;ent &s;hould ever meditate the crime of theft with ap|probation, let him al&s;o think of the gallows. The connexion between the crime and the gibbet, is much nearer and more natural, than many &s;uppo&s;e. Be|hold this thief, and tremble at the thought of &s;teal|ing, which naturally leads on to burglary, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">bery, murder, and the gallows. Let &s;inners &s;ee and fear. Let them &s;uppre&s;s every injurious pa&s;&s;ion, and cov|etous de&s;ire, left they be imperceptibly hurried on to the commi&s;&s;ion of one crime after another, until &s;wift de&s;truction come upon them. Let us all re|&s;olve to embrace, by divine aid, with all our heart, the perfect law of love to God and man.</P>
<P>"Now unto him who is able to keep us from fall|ing, and to pre&s;ent us faultle&s;s before the pre&s;ence of his glory with exceeding joy, be prai&s;e and honour forever."</P>
