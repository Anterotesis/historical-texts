<HEAD>DISCOURSE I.</HEAD>
<P>THE Providence of God this day to be improved is &s;olemn and v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ry affecting. It is no other than the death of the illu&s;trious GEORGE WASHING|TON, who departed this life on the 14th day of the month la&s;t pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Frequently we have convened on mournful occa&s;ions; but never have we experienced a period of &s;uch general lamentation as the pre&s;ent. Our eyes have &s;een the bur&s;ting tear. Our ears have heard the painful &s;hriek of the di&s;con&s;olate. We have beheld hu&s;bands taking the la&s;t full gaze of their deare&s;t companions; parents weeping for their children and refu&s;ing to be comfort|ed, becau&s;e they were not; and feeble, helple&s;s or|phans bereft of their only guides. But this day's &s;er|vices, the&s;e badges of mourning indicate the keene&s;t &s;en&s;ations, at the lo&s;s of a man, great beyond an equal, the father of his country, and the friend of the human race.</P>
<P>Propriety and the intent of this di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ugge&s;t it as &s;uitable, that we feel no le&s;s &s;olemn, than though the remains of this wonderful per&s;onage were now be|fore us, to be entombed in our full view, and by our own hands.</P>
<P>You will therefore let me have your &s;erious and re|ligious attention, while I attempt to &s;tate &s;omething from God's word &s;uited to the very important and mournful occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The words to be the theme of the di&s;cour&s;e, you will find written in the 2d Book of Samuel, the 1&s;t Chapter, and the 27th ver&s;e:
<Q>"How are the mighty fallen!"</Q></P>
<P>The text is part of the Eulogium &s;poken by king
<PB N="4" REF="038304_0004_10119D2A8B307C98">
David on the death of Saul and Jonathan. Being in|&s;pired, his example &s;anctions the propriety of taking &s;pecial notice of the death of tho&s;e who have been illu&s;|trious in their lives. David was a feeling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; and taught of God, he touched the &s;ubject with the &s;ublim|e&s;t &s;trokes of delicacy and &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>He begins; "<HI>The beauty of I&s;rael is &s;tain upon the high places; how are the mighty fallen!</HI>" He goes on; "<HI>tell it not in Gath, publi&s;h it not in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of A&s;kelon. Ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Gilbon let there be no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI>" In the cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of his lamentation, he repeats the text no le&s;s than three times; "<HI>How are the mighty fallen!"</HI></P>
<P>The words pertinently apply to the character of General Wa&s;hington; he was "<HI>mighty.</HI>" They are applicable to his end; he has "<HI>fallen</HI>" a prey to death the king of terrors.</P>
<P>The words <HI>mighty</HI> and <HI>great</HI> have nearly the &s;ame import, I &s;hall, therefore, u&s;e them promi&s;cuou&s;ly in the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e, as &s;hall be mo&s;t convenient.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I &s;hall ob&s;erve &s;ome traits in the char|acter of General Wa&s;hington in which his greatne&s;s was very apparent. Secondly, I &s;hall notice the good|ne&s;s of God in rai&s;ing up &s;uch a character, and con|tinuing his active &s;ervices for &s;o great a length of time. Thirdly, I &s;hall con&s;ider the important in&s;truction to be derived to the people of this country from his character, and the improvement, if wi&s;e, they will make of the Providence of God in taking him out of the world.</P>
<P>In illu&s;trating the character, the following may &s;erve as a &s;ummary. The greatne&s;s of General Wa&s;h|ington appeared from his &s;ingular diffidence in accepting the fir&s;t honors conferred on him; from his refu&s;ing pecuniary compen&s;ation for his many &s;ervices both in the field and cabinet; from his familiar conde&s;cen&s;ion to inferiors; from his remarkable intrepidity and knowl|edge in warlike enterprizes; from his profound &s;kill in in perceiving the re&s;ult of pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, thro' a complication of the mo&s;t difficult and perplexing cir|cum&s;tances;
<PB N="5" REF="038304_0005_10119D2D17520C08">
from his unequaled patience and compo|&s;are of mind on the mo&s;t trying occa&s;ions; from his never having been elated by tho&s;e many and di&s;tingui&s;h|ed honors conferred on him; from his retiring from the fir&s;t o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ce in the nation to the place of a common citizen; and from univer&s;al con&s;ent.</P>
<P>This &s;ummary, I &s;hall endeavor to unfold, with as much brevity and clearne&s;s, as I am capable.</P>
<P>The greatne&s;s of General Wa&s;hington appeared from his &s;ingular diffidence in accepting the fir&s;t honors con|ferred on him. The greatne&s;s of this man was per|ceived in the early part of his life. In Braddock's de|feat he &s;ignalized him&s;elf &s;o as not to be forgotten, tho at this time he was no more than about nineteen years of age. On the commencement of ho&s;tillities between the United States and Great-Britain, the continental Congre&s;s were unanimous in appointing him to the command of the army. The manner of his accepting the appointment, was a &s;trong proof of his greatne&s;s. Not made vain, nor at all moved by the honor confer|red on him, his mind was occupied with the arduou&s;|ne&s;s of the undertaking, and the importance and preca|riou&s;ne&s;s of the re&s;ult. He expre&s;&s;ed his own in&s;ufficien|cy, and dependence on the Di&s;po&s;er of events. Con|&s;cious there was a higher power who over-ruled, he did not depend on an arm of fle&s;h; but with every mark of mode&s;ty and diffidence he accepted his appointment, from a &s;en&s;e of duty and not from motives of &s;elf-exalt|ation. Almo&s;t any other man would have betrayed, either directly or indirectly, undue gratification at be|ing rai&s;ed at once to the highe&s;t po&s;t of tru&s;t and honor in the nation. But General Wa&s;hington, with cheerful reluctance, bids farewel to Vernon's beauteous height, with a diffidence unequaled; and yet with &s;uch intre|pidity and valour as could not fail rou&s;ing the timid, and in&s;piring every bo&s;om with fre&s;h re&s;olution. Steady and unmoved, like a mighty rock, a crown of laurels at the conclu&s;ion of an eight years victorious war, al|tered
<PB N="6" REF="038304_0006_10119D2EC5371158">
not the man. With the &s;ame &s;teady &s;mile, he leaves the field and retires to the &s;weets of private life. Called again, by the free and unanimous &s;uffrages of the people, to the Pre&s;idency of the United States; he expre&s;&s;ed his reluctance. With mode&s;ty he viewed him&s;elf unequal to the betru&s;tment. But &s;wayed by the voice of his country, he comes diffidently to the &s;a|cred book and is qualified to office. Through the an|nals of time, the mode&s;ty and diffidence of Wa&s;hing|ton on the&s;e occa&s;ions will &s;et him up as one of the greate&s;t of the human race.</P>
<P>His greatne&s;s appeared from his refu&s;ing pecuniary compen&s;ation for his many &s;ervices both in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and cabinet. Without any regard to pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, whether they be great or &s;mall, there is a native thir&s;t in the mind to ama&s;s more. This is a maxim which meets univer&s;al credence and is corroborated by fact. But in this re&s;pect General Wa&s;hington mu&s;t be view|ed as &s;ingular and almo&s;t entirely alone. His mind was &s;o elevated and his pa&s;&s;ion for wealth &s;o &s;ubordinate, that the annual compen&s;ation of eight thou&s;and pounds weighed not a feather in his con&s;ideration. In this feeling of mind, he was &s;teady and per&s;evering. He was great in wealth; but it was not his idol. This part of his conduct is at lea&s;t an indication of his great|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The greatne&s;s of General Wa&s;hington appeared from his generous conde&s;cen&s;ion to his inferiors. His &s;ta|tion was the fir&s;t. He was honored more than any other man in the world; but all this did not make him proud and haughty. He did not view it beneath him to mingle in &s;ocial intercour&s;e with the lowe&s;t pea&s;ant. Look to the de&s;pots of the ea&s;tern continent. At what cringing di&s;tance do they hold their &s;ubjects. If they &s;peak, they die. With Wa&s;hington how differ|ent! Tho elevated to the highe&s;t pinnacle of honor, he did not forget that he was a man, and that others were &s;o too. He wanted not flattery nor the parade of
<PB N="7" REF="038304_0007_10119D33EA360BA8">
adulation. He was never more in his element, than in friendly intercour&s;e with tho&s;e of ordinary &s;tation. This his greatne&s;s will never be forgotten.</P>
<P>The greatne&s;s of Wa&s;hington appeared from his re|markable intrepidity and knowledge in warlike enter|prizes. All the talents of general&s;hip united in him. His integrity was &s;o far pa&s;t &s;u&s;picion, that the nation could repo&s;e entire confidence in him, without the lea&s;t imaginary hazzard of fallacy. Be&s;ide, he held the e&s;teem and affections of tho&s;e under his command to a man. His coun&s;els were cool and deliberate; and yet &s;ea&s;onable and adequate. The lives of tho&s;e under him, he view|ed precious, and he would not expo&s;e them contrary to the &s;ounde&s;t policy, and the dictates of the pure&s;t rea&s;on. If he retreated from his enemy, after re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ec|tion would &s;anction the mea&s;ure. If he entered the combat, his valour and intrepidity were exceeded by none. Never was a man farther from cruelty. Pri&s;on|ers of war felt &s;afe at his di&s;po&s;al Compared with him, Alexander and the Cae&s;ars loo&s;e all their glory, as the &s;tars their light by the ri&s;ing &s;un. In &s;hort, language can hardly expre&s;s his talents. He was uniform, and yet amazingly various. When we look on other gen|erals we find one to excel in this thing and another in that. But Wa&s;hington excelled in all. He was great in planning; and yet he was no better in plan|ning than carrying into execution. But that in which he &s;eemed as it were to ri&s;e above him&s;elf, was this, &s;ame did not reach him. He &s;tood aloof from the eclat of an admiring world, like a &s;tatue unmoved. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine, as a warrior and general in the field, antient hi&s;tory produces no rival. All that envy and malice could ever do to le&s;&s;en him, could only &s;et him the high|er and &s;ound the farther the glory of his athcievements.</P>
<P>The greatne&s;s of this man appeared from his pro|found &s;kill in the &s;y&s;tems of national policy After this great man retired from the field, the public opin|ion of him was in part as it is of other men. His mili|tary
<PB N="8" REF="038304_0008_10119D3574941928">
glory re&s;ounded to the remote&s;t clime. But it was conceived this was his greate&s;t excellency, and that in the cabinet it woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> be impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould ar|rive to equal greatne&s;s and fame. No &s;ooner was he promoted to the Pre&s;idency, than the public mind was turned upon him, and prepared, at lea&s;t, to di&s;cover &s;ome weakne&s;s, &s;ome deficiency common to great char|acters. This idea which occupied the mind was the fruit of ob&s;ervation and analogical rea&s;oning. That tal|ents &s;o numerous, &s;o various and &s;o extraordinary &s;hould meet in one man was pa&s;t credibility. Without proof equal to vi&s;ion it could not be admitted. This was the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the public mind. But &s;o &s;oon as General Wa&s;hington had opportunity to di&s;play his political wi&s;dom, he ro&s;e as a &s;tate&s;man to as elevated a pinnacle, as by his military exploits. The truth was, his mind was great and his conceptions adequate to eve|ry undertaking. He was a lover of mankind, and therefore he could not be a tyrant; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, he could not &s;ettle into the oppo&s;ite extreme. To exalt human felicity was his object, and he had genius to di&s;cern the mea&s;ures and principles which would accompli&s;h the end. The be&s;t con&s;titution of civil government &s;eemed to be the natural growth of his mind, and to admini&s;ter to the greate&s;t advantage, was none beyond his abilities. When he took the Pre&s;i|dency, he di&s;covered the difficulties. The jarring and cla&s;hing intere&s;t and pa&s;&s;ions of the various &s;tates of the confederacy, would have been an infurmountable embarra&s;&s;ment to any other mind. But in the fir&s;t out&s;et, each &s;tate of the union felt his impartiality, and was linked by his &s;kill, and make willing to re|nounce party con&s;iderations, and to look to Wa&s;hing|ton as the patron and friend of the whole. When he came to the chair of &s;tate, it was a &s;ea&s;on of peculiar difficulty. Far were we from organization. Our fi|nances were mi&s;erable, and our national credit beneath mediocrity. Foreign kingdoms looked to &s;ee us crum|ble;
<PB N="9" REF="038304_0009_10119D398CB1E890">
but they were di&s;appointed in the re&s;ult. This great chieftain and &s;age of the nation, drew order from confu&s;ion, and &s;oon made America an a&s;ylum for the oppre&s;&s;ed, and the pride and a&s;toni&s;hment of the whole world. As a &s;tate&s;man, his character &s;tands alone. The kings and politicians of ancient and modern Europe, are &s;ullied by Wa&s;hington, as the moon by the u&s;her|ing in of the brightne&s;s of the morning. This his greatne&s;s will live to the late&s;t ages.</P>
<P>The greatne&s;s of General Wa&s;hington appeared from his wonderful fore&s;ight in perceiving the re&s;ult of pre&s;|ent mea&s;ures, through a complication of the mo&s;t diffi|cult and perplexing circum&s;tances. Not to dimini&s;h from the wi&s;dom of others, nor to detract honor from any man, Wa&s;hington, in this re&s;pect, was without a parallel. And herein his greatne&s;s will ever &s;tand ac|knowledged. His acquaintance with men and things was amazing. He knew their pa&s;&s;ions: he was appriz|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of their views and objects. He let all circum&s;tances have their ju&s;t weight and no more. And hence little changes did not affect him. He could &s;ee through a mi&s;t of darkne&s;s which would wholly eclip&s;e the &s;ight of others. His mind was original, exact and clear in its conceptions. He was not ha&s;ty in accompli&s;hing his de&s;igns; and yet he was familiar with the re&s;ult thro' a complication of the mo&s;t intricate circum&s;tances. Clo&s;ely did he cleave to the maxim of the wi&s;e man, that "<HI>in the multitude of coun&s;ellors there is &s;afety;</HI>" yet his mind was independent and his actions without the lea&s;t tincture of party con&s;ideration. This trait in General Wa&s;hington's character can have no ju&s;t de|&s;cription, becau&s;e &s;o rare. It is too delicate and ele|vated to be touched with the pen. We may glance at it and wonder and that is about all we can do. A bet|ter definition cannot be given of it than to &s;ay, it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The greatne&s;s of General Wa&s;hington appeared from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> patience and compo&s;ure of mind on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">. He was bred in affluence, and,
<PB N="10" REF="038304_0010_10119D3C2FB0F430">
in his private capacity, knew no other than the mo&s;t ea&s;y fortune; and hence we might &s;uppo&s;e him le&s;s likely to &s;ubmit with re&s;igned feelings to trying &s;cenes. But, tho exalted by fortune, he was not voluptuous and effeminate. He had the hardihood of antiquity con|nected with the be&s;t modern improvement. To meet extreme difficulties his patience and compo&s;ure of mind were the mo&s;t extraordinary. This example he exhibited both in the field and in the chair of &s;tate. Without permanent re&s;ources; with a &s;mall di|mini&s;hing body of troops, and the country very much di&s;heartened, he endured a whole year's embarra&s;&s;ment in Jer&s;ey and Penn&s;ylvania. He could not fight for want of men. All he could do was to worry the ene|my in the cha&s;e of him; except by mere general&s;hip, which in&s;tances were not a few. But, with almo&s;t eve|ry thing to di&s;courage and backen, he di&s;covered not a &s;ymptom of impatience. Re&s;tle&s;s di&s;content was un|known to him. If ever a per&s;on could be ju&s;tified for want of compo&s;ure, Wa&s;hington would, un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oudtedly, be the man; and yet he was at the farthe&s;t di&s;tance from any thing of the kind. This part of his charac|ter did not appear to be a &s;tudied bu&s;ine&s;s; it was a na|tive feature in it. His patience was not apathy and in|&s;en&s;ibility, for no man had more tender and &s;ublime &s;entiments than he. In his Pre&s;idency many things occurred which would have di&s;compo&s;ed him, had he not been like a &s;trong fortre&s;s, perfectly above the reach of receiving the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion in this part of his char|acter. As a va&s;t rock in the mid&s;t of the &s;ea, again&s;t which the beating billows roll without effect, &s;tood the mighty Wa&s;hington. He could bear in&s;ults without complaining. He could receive the vile&s;t a&s;per&s;ions for the be&s;t deeds, and be as compo&s;ed and patient as if nothing had been done.</P>
<P>The greatne&s;s of General Wa&s;hington appeared from his never having been elated by tho&s;e many and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed honors conferred on him. This feature in the character before us has been partly anticipated, and yet
<PB N="11" REF="038304_0011_10119D3F357FA9D8">
&s;omething more, I conceive, may be pertinently con|&s;idered. In the e&s;teem of the people at large through|out the United States, this patriot &s;tood va&s;tly higher than any other man. He had his enemies, but even they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;pecting him. The prai&s;es of Wa&s;hington were re&s;ounded from one end of the Union to the other. People differently educated, of oppo&s;ite views and principles, varied not any in &s;etting him up as the greate&s;t General and State&s;man in the world. This was not only done by the people at large; the great and the learned con&s;idered it as indubitable. It was not a mere &s;ilent opinion; but it was a matter expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, and by actions of the mo&s;t unequivocal import. General Wa&s;hington was per|fectly apprized of the light in which he was holden. It was none of it concealed from him. Let it be con&s;ider|ed that the&s;e honors were heaped upon him, at a period of life in which they would be very likely to flatter and elate. But his mind was &s;o &s;teady, &s;o weighty and ex|alted in its apprehen&s;ions, that all the&s;e were without the lea&s;t apparent effect in giving him a more exalted opinion of him&s;elf. We know that to feel lifted up at &s;ame, is incident to human nature. Few have wi&s;dom and great|ne&s;s &s;ufficient wholely to conceal i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, even tho the de|gree of honor conferred be very moderate. Wa&s;hington was an exception of ever di&s;covering a &s;ymptom. Some|times he even wept at the amazing parade in crowning him with laurels; and when he could decently, he with|drew from the reach of tho&s;e who were prepared to ex|pre&s;s their &s;entiments of re&s;pect in forms the mo&s;t honora|ry. Than this nothing could be a more &s;triking mark of General Wa&s;hington's greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>His greatne&s;s was farther manife&s;t in his voluntarily retiring from the fir&s;t office in the nation to the place of a common citizen. When he drew near the clo&s;e of the time, for which he had been elected to the Pre&s;idency, he could not but have known, beyond he&s;itancy, that the people, with unanimous &s;uffrages, were ready to rai&s;e him again to the &s;ame dignified &s;tation. But this
<PB N="12" REF="038304_0012_10119D41EA0825A8">
great man had a preference for the peaceful retreats of private life. In the bo&s;om of man there is a thir&s;t for hon|or; but Wa&s;hington had gained the ma&s;tery over this pa&s;|&s;ion. And what &s;eemed greatly to corroborate it, was his accepting the appointment of Lieutenant General, an in|ferior office to that he had before bolden. If we trace antient and modern hi&s;tory, where &s;hall we find a parallel in&s;tance. Cincinnatus may be mentioned; but this in every re&s;pect does not equal it. Do we find the kings of Europe, A&s;ia and Africa pulling off their crowns, and giving them to others, and humbling them&s;elves to the condition of common &s;ubjects? Not an in&s;tance of this kind can be produced. They hold power as long as they can, and this without con&s;ulting the choice of tho&s;e over whom they reign. How different was Wa&s;hington! He was willing to take the lowe&s;t &s;eat, and this was exaltation and greatne&s;s of the pure&s;t kind.</P>
<P>Finally, the greatne&s;s of this man appeared from uni|ver&s;al con&s;ent. It is almo&s;t univer&s;ally the ca&s;e, that characters which ri&s;e the highe&s;t, do &s;omething toward the conclu&s;ion, to fully their glory; but this great General and Patriot did nothing. His character was a fini&s;hed one. The la&s;t part was equal to the fir&s;t. It grew brighter and brighter till the &s;un went down. It was all greatne&s;s. And thus it was con&s;idered, not only by Americans; but by all the nations of the world. They gathered the &s;en|timent in part from his writings, in part from his military achievements, and in part from his political knowledge and wi&s;dom di&s;played in the fir&s;t office of the government. Attention to all the&s;e &s;ources entitled him to an acknowl|edged &s;uperiority to any other man upon the globe. His legacy, how replete with wi&s;dom and depth of conception! His deeds, how unexceptionable, and fraught with every thing that was noble and conducting to national felicity and glory! So much in one man could not be hidden. It was beholden by an a&s;toni&s;hed world, and Wa&s;hington &s;tands acknowledged the fir&s;t, the greate&s;t of the human race. Thus I have ob&s;erved &s;ome traits in General Wa&s;h|ington's character, in which his greatne&s;s was very apparent.</P>

I proceed in the &s;econd place to notice the goodne&s;s of God, in rai&s;ing up &s;uch a character and continuing his ac|tive &s;ervices, for &s;o great length of time.</P>
<P>We &s;hall greatly fail in this part of the &s;ubject, if we omit con&s;idering, and letting it &s;ink into our minds, that the Lord God was the great potter and former of the character we have been un&s;olding. The greatne&s;s of it, in every re&s;pect, in all the in&s;tances in which we have view|ed it, was an effect of Almighty efficiency. It was the will of God to have &s;uch a character, a ve&s;&s;el of &s;uch va&s;t dimen&s;ions; and, therefore, he &s;aid, let it be, and Wa&s;h|ington was rai&s;ed up. God's ultimate end in thus doing, as in every thing, was to di&s;play him&s;elf. And his good|ne&s;s herein is very vi&s;ible to all of &s;piritual di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>Let us then &s;earch into the goodne&s;s of God in the mat|ter above &s;pecified; and to help our memories and guide our judgments, let us take the following out-lines as a &s;ummary. The goodne&s;s of God in rai&s;ing up General Wa&s;hington and continuing his active &s;ervices for &s;o great length of time, is &s;trikingly apparent, from the ble&s;&s;ings conferred on the people of this country through his in&s;tru|mentality; from his example to future generations; from the influence his conduct may probably have with tho&s;e, who hereafter &s;hall be rai&s;ed to the &s;ame elevated &s;tations; from the very weighty in&s;truction and reproof herein giv|en to all tyrants and de&s;pots; and that God has hereby e&s;tabli&s;hed, by a vi&s;ible and acknowledged providence, one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential points in the &s;y&s;tem of revealed re|ligion, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> his ab&s;olute &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>The goodne&s;s of God in rai&s;ing up General Wa&s;hing|ton, and continuing his active &s;ervices for &s;o great length of time, is &s;trikingly apparent, from the ble&s;&s;ings confer|red on the people of this country through his in&s;trument|ality. In e&s;tabli&s;hing our national independence, Gene|ral Wa&s;hington was an in&s;trument greater than any other. By this no one will imagine there is the lea&s;t de&s;ign to detract from other characters and fully their &s;ame. We have had many heroes and great &s;tate&s;men who&s;e names will never be forgotten by a grateful people, and through whom God's
<PB N="14" REF="038304_0014_10119D4649FD3C58">
goodne&s;s has been &s;trikingly exhibited. It is pleaded, however, that General Wa&s;hington was undoubtedly the fir&s;t and greate&s;t. To &s;ever this country from foreign do|minion, was the will of heaven, and it was the decree, to do it by in&s;truments and not by miracle. The man who&s;e le&s;s we now mourn, was the principal in&s;trument, and how great the goodne&s;s of God in rai&s;ing him up! This may be &s;et in the mo&s;t obvious point of view, by con&s;id|ering our national and individual ble&s;&s;ings. As a nation, we are the proprietors of a free and happy country. We have not to cro&s;s the wide Atlantic to con&s;ult the plea&s;ure of our &s;overeign. Our property is our own by indefea&s;i|ble tenure. We are built on the broad ba&s;e of freedom, and our national government is in every view &s;uch as good citizens will prize as one of the greate&s;t of temporal ble&s;&s;|ings. Nothing is wanting but good and pious hearts to make us the happie&s;t people on the globe Taking into view our civil privileges, the goodne&s;s of God is mo&s;t vi&s;i|ble in rai&s;ing up the in&s;truments by which they are &s;ecu|red to us. Among the&s;e, Wa&s;hington was the principal. He, under God, has guided us through inde&s;eribable haz|ards to independence and national felicity. God was the efficient cau&s;e of the whole; and yet he gave exi&s;tence to the talents of this great man, and u&s;ed them to accompli&s;h his benevolent de&s;ign. And how good is the Lord, that he &s;hould endow one in this country, with &s;uch unequaled portions of integrity, wi&s;dom and fortitude, as to take us by the hand and lead us &s;afely to a field of &s;uch invalu|able privileges as tho&s;e we po&s;&s;e&s;s? We can never adore this goodne&s;s enough. And what heightens the good|ne&s;s of God, in rai&s;ing up this great and di&s;tingui&s;hed character, is, that we were favored with his active &s;ervices for &s;o great length of time. We had the u&s;e of his abilities in &s;ituations the mo&s;t hazardous for twenty-five years in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. When a nation begins to exi&s;t, then is mo&s;t wanted the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e. God &s;aw our nece&s;&s;ities, and did not withhold the bounty of his goodne&s;s. He gave us Wa&s;hington to go before us, and to be with us, and to nouri&s;h us up to our pre&s;ent &s;tate of national im|portance.

It would be infidelity it&s;elf not to notice the goodne&s;s of God in this matter. The eminent u&s;efulne&s;s of this great man we do not deny; that his being and tal|ents were from God is beyond he&s;itancy; and that the whole was the fruit of unmerited goodne&s;s, will be felt by all, but the vile and abominable.</P>
<P>Our privileges in &s;mall &s;ocieties and individual capacity are handed to us by God through the &s;ame channel of conveyance. The lea&s;t ob&s;ervation mu&s;t lead us to no|tice it If foreign power could tax away our property at option and demand our young men to &s;ight their bloody battles, could any of us do otherwi&s;e than go mourning, and acknowledge our&s;elves to be &s;laves and pen&s;ioners? But ble&s;&s;ed be God it is not &s;o with us; and why is it the rever&s;e? The Lord has wrought through the in&s;tru|mentality of him, who&s;e wi&s;dom and prowe&s;s have given us freedom and independence and &s;ecured to us our property beyond the fear of having it divided without our con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The goodne&s;s of God is manife&s;t in his rai&s;ing up Gen|eral Wa&s;hington and promoting him to the high offices he &s;u&s;tained, from the con&s;ideration, that his example &s;till exi&s;ts and will never be obliterated from the memory of man. The force of example, experience teaches, is ve|ry great. Nothing can have a more baneful effect on a community than bad example, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e of eleva|ted &s;tations. Virtuous example has the contrary tenden|cy. The reign of David over I&s;rael was very unexcep|tionable, and the happy influence of his example de&s;cend|ed to future generations. We have the character of Gen|eral Wa&s;hington portrayed before our eyes, and our chil|dren's children will be the objects of its influence. And what &s;pecial le&s;&s;on doth it enforce? To an&s;wer in a word, it bears te&s;timony again&s;t immoral practices of every de|&s;cription, and paints virtue in charms which cannot ea&s;ily be re&s;i&s;ted. Wa&s;hington is no more; but his example is a living monitor. This is a &s;harper reproof to vice, than the threats of maje&s;ty, or the terrors of the halter or the gibbet. The value of the example is greatly heightened, from the con&s;ideration that it is well-known to all cla&s;&s;es
<PB N="16" REF="038304_0016_10119D4D64D70BA8">
of citizens from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t. The good|ne&s;s of God is very vi&s;ible in this particular.</P>
<P>From the influence his conduct may probably have with tho&s;e, who hereafter &s;hall be rai&s;ed to the &s;ame important &s;tations, we may al&s;o &s;ee the goodne&s;s of God. If Gen|erals in the field and Pre&s;idents of Congre&s;s, &s;hould be at a lo&s;s how to &s;teer amid&s;t perplexities which &s;ometimes oc|cur, they have a character before them from which wi&s;|dom flows as a &s;tream from its fountain. Having caught the mantle of this great &s;tate&s;man, tho&s;e who fill the high|e&s;t &s;eats in the government, it is &s;anguinely hoped, will transfu&s;e its ble&s;&s;ing to ages yet unborn. Wa&s;hington, &s;tanding at the head of the &s;eries, will give complexion and features to what &s;hall follow in the admini&s;tration of this great and flouri&s;hing empire. At lea&s;t the &s;entiment is not chimerical nor wholely improbable. This is a fruit of divine goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>The goodness of God is manife&s;t in rai&s;ing up and con|tinuing this great man at the helm of the nation &s;o long, from the very weighty in&s;truction and reproof hereby giv|en to all tyrants and de&s;pots.</P>
<P>The greater part of the ea&s;tern continent is &s;ubjected to de&s;poti&s;m. The life and property of the &s;ubject are at the &s;ole plea&s;ure of the prince. Thir&s;t for power and ag|grandizement is the governing pa&s;&s;ion. The obedience they receive is of the &s;lavi&s;h kind; it proceeds not from love, but from fear of their vengeance. Well might they look to Wa&s;hington and be in&s;tructed, that the highe&s;t excel|lency of a ruler, is to be ju&s;t and benevolent, and that to have obedient and faithful &s;ubjects, is to prove him&s;elf their patron and friend. How reproved mu&s;t &s;tand tho&s;e de&s;|pots and hard hearted tyrants who have embrued their hands in innocent blood, by the bright example of this mighty hero and &s;tate&s;man? Through the goodne&s;s of God, we have rea&s;on to conclude, they have felt the re|proof, at lea&s;t in &s;ome &s;mall degree. The high e&s;tima|tion in which General Wa&s;hington has been holden by all the kings and princes on the globe &s;eems to imply it. If &s;o, the condition of millions in &s;ervitude is hopefully me|liorated

and rendered more tolerable in con&s;equence of the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a character. If in this way th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Gov|ernor of all events, be &s;oftening the rigor of de&s;poti&s;m, then his great goodne&s;s in rai&s;ing up and continuing Gen|eral Wa&s;hington in the important &s;tations he held &s;o long, cannot but be clearly &s;een.</P>
<P>The goodne&s;s of God is very &s;rikingly exhibited in rai&s;ing up the character we have been contemplating, &s;ince, through this providence, he has e&s;tabli&s;hed one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential points in the &s;y&s;tem of revealed religion, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> his ab&s;olute &s;overeignty. By the &s;overeignty of God is meant nothing which cla&s;hes with infinite goodne&s;s. It is not an arbitrary procedure contrary to the rea&s;on and fitne&s;s of things. It is his creating and governing the world and all beings according to his own righteous plea&s;ure. The point is e&s;tabli&s;hed by natural religion. It is confirmed with additional clearne&s;s in the two te&s;taments. Such pa&s;&s;ages as the&s;e evidence it to demon&s;tration. "<HI>He work|eth all things after the coun&s;el of his own will.</HI>" "<HI>All things were made by him and for him.</HI>" "<HI>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy and compa&s;&s;ion on whom be will have compa&s;&s;ion.</HI>" "<HI>We are the clay and thou our potter.</HI>" The &s;elf &s;ame &s;entiment is forced upon the mind, by the char|acter we have been con&s;idering. The fact is this; God Almighty formed Wa&s;hington a greater ve&s;&s;el than almo&s;t any other, and in this way has proved his &s;overeign right to make men to differ. In making &s;ome great and others &s;mall he is ju&s;tifiable, becau&s;e the clay is his. Complain|ingly to object, why ha&s;t thou made me thus? is contend|ing with a mo&s;t material point in the &s;y&s;tem of revealed religion, corroborated by the goodne&s;s of God, in the acknowledged fact under con&s;ideration. Let us then not di&s;pute the ab&s;olute &s;overeignty of God, till we &s;acrifice our judgments on the altar of ob&s;tinacy, and put out our eyes for fear of the light.</P>
<P>Having noted in&s;tances of the goodne&s;s of God in form|ing and continuing this illu&s;trious character for &s;o great length of time; I &s;hall thirdly, con&s;ider the important in&s;truction to be derived to the people of this country from

his character, and the improvement, if wi&s;e, they will make of the providence of God in taking him out of the world.</P>
<P>From the character of General Wa&s;hington, the inhab|itants of this country may derive many very &s;pecial le&s;&s;ons of in&s;truction. With the help of this character they can have no he&s;itancy on whom to turn their thoughts to fill the mo&s;t important offices in the government. It may be admitted as a ruling maxim, that tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s the neare&s;t likene&s;s to this great warrior and &s;tate&s;man, will have the fir&s;t claim on our &s;uffrages and influence. Wa&s;hington po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the virtues and abilities requi&s;ite to fit him to pre&s;ide over a nation, and, of cour&s;e, tho&s;e who approach the neare&s;t to him in the&s;e re&s;pects will in future admini&s;|ter be&s;t; till the ble&s;&s;ed period &s;hall arrive, when the Prince of Peace &s;hall &s;olve all nations into a happy kingdom and rule by his heavenly &s;ceptre.</P>
<P>The people in this country may be farther in&s;tructed by this character, that vice and immorality utterly di&s;qualify a man for an important, public &s;tation. The confidence of a people is not attainable by ba&s;e characters. A man of di&s;orderly life will always be &s;u&s;pected of a radical de|fect. Tho&s;e who fill the fir&s;t offices &s;hould be men in whom entire confidence may be repo&s;ed without &s;u&s;picion. Wa&s;hington was &s;uch a man. And how happy and ex|alted have we been under his admini&s;tration! And hence the people in this country, if &s;uitably impre&s;&s;ed, will cau|tiou&s;ly avoid all characters of the oppo&s;ite complexion in filling the chair of &s;tate. "<HI>When the wicked rule, the peo|ple mourn.</HI>"</P>
<P>But it is time to de&s;cend to the la&s;t clau&s;e of that part of the &s;ubject under con&s;ideration, and to &s;earch after the improvement tho&s;e who are wi&s;e will make of the provi|dence of God in removing General Wa&s;hington by death. He who hath loved us, fought for us and worn out his life in the &s;ervices of his country, is now entombed in the &s;ilent grave. Never will he be &s;een more by mortal eye. Never will another &s;peech fall from his lips. He is gone where all mu&s;t go, and this has been ordered by the wi&s;e

di&s;po&s;al of God. And what improvement &s;hall we make of this affecting providence? Perhaps we may be almo&s;t ready to &s;ay, wherefore is it thus! Why &s;hould the exe|cutioner be &s;uffered &s;o &s;peedily to do his work! Could not his ha&s;ty &s;teps have been a little retarded! Such thoughts mu&s;t not be indulged. God's "<HI>thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his ways as our ways. Though clouds and darkne&s;s are round about him; yet ju&s;tice and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</HI>" It becomes us to &s;ubmit and ki&s;s the rod which is laid &s;o heavily on us, and open our mouths in the language of in&s;piration, "<HI>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, and ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord.</HI>"</P>
<P>In improving this death, we of this nation cannot but behold a thick and di&s;mal cloud &s;u&s;pended over us. Our head, our greate&s;t coun&s;ellor, the man the mo&s;t beloved and tru&s;ted to, is taken away. We have, therefore ju&s;t occa&s;ion for mourning. Our lo&s;s is greater, than we yet imagine. It may well be &s;en&s;ibly felt, by every &s;tate in the Union, by every &s;maller community, and by every in|dividual. O Wa&s;hington, thou are gone, but we will not forget thee! Thy great deeds, thy glorious achiev|ments &s;hall be engraven in letters of gold. When we look on our dear-bought freedom we will think of thee. When we count our trea&s;ures, when we &s;ee our children growing up in a garden of delights, di&s;tant from the thun|der of de&s;poti&s;m, we will teach them to li&s;p thy name. We do weep for thee, and in broken accents, bid thee a long, la&s;t farewel.</P>
<P>In improving this death, it becomes all the inhabitants of united America to lift up their &s;ervent prayer to God through his &s;on, that the wi&s;dom and virtues of this great man de&s;cend and re&s;t on tho&s;e who hold the fir&s;t offices in the nation. Ye civil fathers, we cannot but mingle the tears of condolence with you. You are deprived of a brother and a father. In perplexing &s;ituations, you looked to him for wi&s;dom and coun&s;el; but he is taken from your head, our prayer is, that you, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive hearts, catch hismantle, and &s;tay your&s;elves on the Lord.</P>

<P>THESE words are an inference drawn by the twen|ty-four elders from &s;omething which preceded. They &s;at before God on their &s;eats and were furni&s;hed with the text I have read to you by the &s;eventh angel. The declaration of the angel, or rather the found which proceeded from him, was followed with great voices in heaven, &s;aying, "<HI>The kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t, and he &s;hall reign forever and ever.</HI>" On the hearing of this, the twenty-four elders, who &s;at before God, fell upon their faces and wor&s;hipped God, &s;aying, "<HI>We give thee thanks, O Lord God almighty, which art and wa&s;t, and art to come; becau&s;e thou ha&s;t taken to thee thy great power and ha&s;t reigned.</HI>" What particularly dilated their hearts with prai&s;e and thank&s;giving to God, was the wonderful effect produced by his almighty efficiency in cau&s;ing the kingdoms of this world to become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chri&s;t. The twenty-four elders traced the effect to its true &s;ource and origin, and a&s;cribed it to the governing power of almighty God; "<HI>becau&s;e thou ha&s;t taken to thee thy great power and ha&s;t reigned.</HI>"</P>
<P>When they &s;aw Chri&s;t's kingdom ri&s;ing out of the ruins of the apo&s;tacy, and the wicked nations of this world &s;ub|mitting to his divine and heavenly &s;ceptre, they could ac|count for it on no other principle, than that God had the control of the di&s;po&s;itions of men, to turn them according to his &s;overeign plea&s;ure.

Secondly, Shall &s;hew that the&s;e bene|fits and ble&s;&s;ings are to be accounted for &s;olely from this plain truth &s;tated in the text, that the Lord God doth take to him&s;elf his great power and doth reign. Thirdly, I &s;hall point out the obligations under which we are to give thanks to God, that we, and all creatures and things, are under his admini&s;tration and ab&s;olute control.</P>
<P>Fir&s;tly, We are to con&s;ider &s;ome of the peculiar ble&s;&s;|ings and benefits we enjoy. It is a great ble&s;&s;ing to have &s;uch an exi&s;tence as that of man.</P>
<P>This will appear from a variety of con&s;iderations, &s;ome of which I &s;hall enumerate. When we compare our&s;elves with the various &s;pecies of creatures that fall under our

ob&s;ervation, how decided is our preference to be men, rath|er than animals of any other order. All creatures upon earth, except man, move by in&s;tinct and blind pa&s;&s;ion. They are capable of no improvement in &s;ubjects of a moral nature, and to di&s;cover the lea&s;t degree of difference be|tween virtue and vice, they have no ability. But man is endowed with noble faculties and is a capable &s;ubject of ri&s;ing higher and higher in knowledge and virtue to all eternity. A foundation being laid in us for &s;uch va&s;t im|provement, mu&s;t endear exi&s;tence to every one, who con|templates the matter in a ju&s;t light: To &s;ay the lea&s;t, to have &s;uch an exi&s;tence, is a great benefit and ble&s;&s;ing. But when we take into con&s;ideration the amazing value conferred on our exi&s;tence by the Chri&s;tian religion. the favor is augmented beyond conception. The exi&s;tence of any creature is ever to be e&s;timated according to the felicity it is capable of receiving. Man is to exi&s;t forever, and, if a Chri&s;tian, as he may be, if he will give Chri&s;t his heart, nothing &s;hort of happine&s;s "<HI>which eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard,</HI>" will be his certain and unfailing por|tion. Thus contemplating the matter, we cannot but &s;ee the immen&s;e value of our exi&s;tence, and that to be endowed with &s;uch improving faculties is a ble&s;&s;ing of inde&s;cribable importance.</P>
<P>It is a great ble&s;&s;ing to have bodies &s;o curious and won|derfully made. The very &s;hape and motion of man excite awe and reverence in the inferior orders of creatures and challenge &s;uperiority. Our bodies are organized to be a &s;uitable repo&s;itory for a rational &s;pirit. They are &s;o &s;kill|fully contrived as not to &s;hackle the &s;oul and prevent its moral and intellectual improvements. Well &s;aid the P&s;alm|i&s;t; "<HI>I will prai&s;e thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made, and in thy book all my members were written. How precious are thy thoughts unto me, O God!</HI>"</P>
<P>Health is a peculiar benefit and ble&s;&s;ing. The body, tho curiou&s;ly organized, is yet delicate and expo&s;ed to al|mo&s;t innumerable di&s;adju&s;tments. If any of the parts loo&s;e their proper tone, the effect is &s;en&s;ibly felt through the whole. If one member &s;uffer, all the members &s;uffer with

it. Great exactne&s;s mu&s;t be maintained in the human frame, or health will be impaired. Vi&s;it ho&s;pitals and rooms of the &s;ick, and hear the groans of tho&s;e who are racked with pain, and deny, if po&s;&s;ible, that health is a peculiar ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>To have and enjoy a competency of the good things of this life, is a benefit which it would be ungrateful to over|look. Laid in the balance with religion, the&s;e things are lighter than vanity; and yet, during our abode upon earth, they are indi&s;pen&s;ible. God does not &s;upport man by mi|racle, nor warm and clothe him otherwi&s;e than by means. In the cold of winter, without clothing, food and fuel, man would be immediately wretched. The piercing fro&s;t would benumb his limbs, and gnawing hunger make him a prey to death. Looking, therefore, upon the inevita|ble con&s;equences of being deprived of every worldly good thing, the benefit of the means of bodily &s;upport cannot but be &s;een in its proper light.</P>
<P>The benefits and advantages re&s;ulting from &s;ocial inter|cour&s;e in &s;ociety may well hold a high place in our e&s;ti|mation. Man is formed for &s;ociety, and this is a great &s;ource of his happine&s;s. Exclude him from holding con|nection with any of his &s;pecies, and he is wretched. All his trials and difficulties mu&s;t remain locked up in his own bo&s;om. The organs of &s;peech and hearing would be u&s;e|le&s;s to him. Here he mu&s;t &s;pin out his life without one kind look from any creature, or the hearing of one articu|late note. To roam in &s;olitude, how tedious, days and nights! but, on the other hand, open to man all the ad|vantages of &s;ociety, the family circle and every thing be|yond, of friendly intercour&s;e, and what a large field of plea|&s;ures and advantages di&s;clo&s;e to view. Is he under a cloud of adver&s;ity, his friends &s;tand ready to &s;ympathize. Has he plea&s;ures, they are doubled by imparting. It is to &s;o|ciety our moral and intellectual faculties are indebted for a great &s;hare of their improvement, and, by often &s;peak|ing one to another, Chri&s;tians are excited to a more vigor|ous animation in the duties they owe to God and men. Thus &s;ociety is a peculiar ble&s;&s;ing and benefit.</P>
<P>Civil government is another di&s;tingui&s;hed privilege and
<PB N="25" REF="038304_0025_10119D69DE040948">
ble&s;&s;ing. Such are our pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;uch the connection between men, that civil in&s;titutions are ab&s;olutely requi|&s;ite. God has over-ruled in this matter, that men might be &s;ecured in their rights, and that the lawle&s;s and di&s;o|bedient may be checked in their abominations. There|fore it is written; "<HI>Who&s;oever re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;t|eth the ordinance of God; and they who re&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves damnation. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good and thou &s;hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> have prai&s;e of the &s;ame. For he is a mini&s;ter of God to thee for good; but if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the &s;word in vain, for he is the mini&s;ter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</HI>" Thus we &s;ee the de&s;ign of civil government. Its end is noble and a privilege granted to man of no inferior importance. That we might realize its utility, let us contemplate &s;ociety independen of it. Let us view the wicked and lawle&s;s without re&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, at liberty to invade life and property at option. Were mat|ters thus circum&s;tanced, who would be &s;afe and not be continually expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t ba&s;e aggre&s;&s;ions? All mu&s;t be convinced, that wretchedne&s;s would be the unavoidable re&s;ult. Neighbour would rob neighbour, and our &s;treets would be drenched in blood. Civil government is that, which, under God, &s;ecures life and property and &s;tamps them with value. It is, therefore, an evident ble&s;&s;ing, a benefit un&s;peakably rich.</P>
<P>Having pur&s;ued the &s;ubject thus far, ble&s;&s;ings of another kind offer them&s;elves to our con&s;ideration. By the&s;e are meant &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in Chri&s;t. The go&s;pel, which brings life and immortality to light, is a trea&s;ure &s;o great, that every other dwindles to nothing holden in competi|tion with it. The ultimate de&s;ign of it, is not to teach men the arts and oeconomy of this world. It di&s;clo&s;es glad tidings of great joy, &s;tates the grounds of admi&s;&s;ion to the favor of God, and what we mu&s;t do to be &s;aved. The go&s;pel, therefore, is a ble&s;&s;ing by it&s;elf and without a parallel.</P>
<P>The philo&s;ophers of antiquity had their conjectures re|&s;pecting a future &s;tate, but they were the idle chimeras of
<PB N="26" REF="038304_0026_10119D6BB733AEF0">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> darkne&s;s. Ari&s;totle, Socrates and Plato made attempts to reclaim men from the arms of vice; but their attempts were fruitle&s;s. If they pre&s;cribed formularies, they had no authority to enforce them, and to &s;hew of|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nding man how he might be pardoned for crimes already c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mmitted, they were as incapable as their mo&s;t ignorant pupils. But the Son of Righteou&s;ne&s;s has cha&s;ed away every cloud of heatheni&s;h ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, and explained, to the lowe&s;t capacity, the way of life. The go&s;pel a&s;&s;erts the doctrine of the atonement, and yet it has other concomitant ble&s;&s;ings. The atonement and &s;alva|tion are two things. In perfect ju&s;tice, God might have made apropitiation for &s;in, without &s;aving the &s;inner; and yet he grants eternal life to whom&s;oever he plea&s;es. Sal|vation &s;uppo&s;es an exemption from the penalty of God's righteous law, and admi&s;&s;ion into his heavenly kingdom. In this is compri&s;ed conviction of &s;in, regeneration, &s;anc|tification, and a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s which fadeth not away. Thus I have noticed &s;ome peculiar ble&s;&s;ings and benefits conferred upon man.</P>
<P>Secondly, I &s;hall &s;how that the&s;e benefits and ble&s;&s;ings are to be accounted for &s;olely from this plain truth &s;tated in the text, that the Lord God doth take to him&s;elf his great power and doth reign. The rea&s;oning by which it may be made to appear that God governs, is ea&s;y, it is not far fetched. It is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence re&s;ulting from the perfections of his nature. If God be the author of all things he mu&s;t govern them. His government mu&s;t be as exten&s;ive as his works. Our ideas of God's government are too limited, if we &s;uppo&s;e only &s;ome great things under his control, and others more minute, left out of his plan. The falling of a &s;parrow to the ground and the numbering of the very hairs of our head, are matters of which he has the particular di&s;po&s;al. And hence all the ble&s;&s;ings we have enumerated are the immediate fruit of his almighty, governing efficiency. God governs in the matter of our exi&s;tence. For pre&s;ervation we are ab|&s;olutely dependent. In him we live, move and have our being. The favor of having a rational exi&s;tence above
<PB N="27" REF="038304_0027_10119D705317C970">
other creatures, is becau&s;e God is at the head of the uni|ver&s;e and has &s;o ordered. When we contemplate our bod|ies &s;o curiou&s;ly formed, our improving faculties, the means of improvement, our health and &s;trength, our food and raiment, and con over the whole &s;um of ble&s;&s;ings generally called common, we can trace their origin no farther than to the reigning power of God. Men &s;peak of the&s;e things as matters of mere chance, and often prai&s;e their own wi&s;|dom for having planned affairs &s;o luckily. They arrogate to them&s;elves all the glory, and conduct as if there were no God. Neverthele&s;s, by arguments, a priori, the being of a God is found to be nece&s;&s;ary, and by fair deductions <HI>a po&s;teriori</HI> his attributes and univer&s;al government are con|clu&s;ively maintained. And hence, it is no infringement on the be&s;t <HI>logic</HI> to &s;peak as in the following &s;entences. He maketh rich and he maketh poor, he exalteth and he ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;eth. Every &s;pire of gra&s;s, every blade of wheat, every degree of growth in an animal, is an effect of his mighty agency. He gives &s;trength to bea&s;ts, and cau&s;es them to exerci&s;e it for man, as &s;trictly as he gave birth to creation, and governs in little things as e&s;pecially as in great. It is ju&s;t &s;o in re&s;pect to civil government. It is the Lord's. He holds the heart and volitions of every ruler from the high|e&s;t to the lowe&s;t. By him kings reign, and princes de|cree ju&s;tice. If men mean evil, God means it for good. If they de&s;pi&s;e and refu&s;e to retain him in their knowledge, he will, neverthele&s;s, be exalted, and from that very mat|ter get to him&s;elf a great name.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity, with all its ble&s;&s;ed effects, is known and enjoyed, becau&s;e God hath taken to him&s;elf his great pow|er and hath reigned. The covenant of redemption ratifi|ed between the Father and the Son, before the world began, was of the Lord. The coming, life, death, re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t, were un|der his &s;uperintendence. He reigns in the work of con|viction. "<HI>Thine arrows are &s;harp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.</HI>" A&s;ide from this, men will never know them&s;elves. They will glide a|long in the broad road to ruin and perceive it not. Finite
<PB N="28" REF="038304_0028_10119D749BDDAAC0">
art is inadequate to di&s;cover to them their hazardous &s;itua|tion. But when di&s;play of God's power is made, they will be pricked to the heart, and &s;ee them&s;elves to be poor, and wretched, and mi&s;erable, and blind, and naked. Man is naturally di&s;inclined to &s;ee the light. His eyes are fa&s;t &s;hut again&s;t it. And to keep him blind, &s;atan is always bu&s;y. But the power of God &s;upercedes every ob&s;truction, and produces the wonderful effect of convincing him of his real condition.</P>
<P>The renovation of the heart, is becau&s;e God reigns and has the di&s;po&s;itions of men at his command. The wonder|ful effect in the millennium, in cau&s;ing the kingdoms of this world to become the kingdoms of Chri&s;t, is traced to this &s;ource. And there is no other way of accounting for the regeneration of any &s;inner. "<HI>The new birth is not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man; but of God.</HI>" Men are not converted as a reward for any thing previou&s;ly done by them to purcha&s;e the change. They do not put them&s;elves into a &s;alvable &s;tate, by &s;inning le&s;s, and &s;o invite God to renew them. He is found of them, who &s;ought him not. He conquers the &s;tubborn heart in the full &s;trength of its oppo&s;ition, and, by his invi&s;ible draw|ings, captivates the &s;oul to the obedience of faith.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tians are kept from final apo&s;tacy by the &s;ame power by which they are regenerated. Chri&s;t takes care of his flock. He is the great ruling &s;hepherd, and, therefore, none are lo&s;t from his &s;old. They are kept by the power of God, through faith, unto &s;alvation. Thus the matter of &s;aving &s;inners, from beginning to end, is through the infinite reigning power of God. This has always been the ca&s;e and will be till time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I &s;hall point out the obligations under which we are to give thanks to God, that we, and all creatures and things, are under his admini&s;tration and ab&s;olute con|trol. Men, in general, will grant they are under obliga|tions of gratitude to God; but what this gratitude ought ultimately to re&s;pect is not &s;o commonly perceived and ac|knowledged. God is good to us, and therefore that we ought to make grateful returns to him, will not be conte&s;ted.
<PB N="29" REF="038304_0029_10119D7780E75E78">
But if we love God on no higher principle, than that we our&s;elves are made gainers by his goodne&s;s, our love is of a &s;elfi&s;h kind, and our gratitude the fruit of a &s;inful heart. "<HI>If ye love them that love you, what thank have ye:</HI>" For &s;inners give to &s;inners, in hopes to receive as much again. There is no love acceptable with God, &s;hort of that which e&s;teems and adores him for what he is in him&s;elf; nor any gratitude fit to be &s;o denominated, except thank&s;giving which is put into exerci&s;e by the con&s;ideration, that he takes to him&s;elf his great power and doth reign. Our obliga|tions to gratitude remain to be unfolded. One obligation to give thanks to God for his univer&s;al reign, may be gath|ered from analogy. Rea&s;oning from analogy reflects great light on many &s;ubjects in divinity. The point before us is not an exception. Holy beings are excited to devout thank&s;giving, in view of the plea&s;ing truth, that all crea|tures and things are under the ab&s;olute control of the Al|mighty. We may be a&s;&s;ured this was the ca&s;e in regard to the twenty-four elders. "<HI>We give thee thanks, O Lord God almighty, which art, and wa&s;t, and art to come; be|cau&s;e thou ha&s;t taken to thee thy great power and ha&s;t reigned.</HI>" The &s;aints in light and all the holy angels, are continually &s;houting, "<HI>Amen: ble&s;&s;ing, and glory, and wi&s;dom, and thank&s;giving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God forever and ever.</HI>" The &s;pring of the whole is, that God's reign extends to all events and circum&s;tances, and &s;ecures a final re&s;ult in every view mo&s;t eligible. Do then the inhabitants of the glorious world feel them&s;elves obligated to render thanks to God, becau&s;e he hath taken to him&s;elf his great power and doth reign? Is this the bu&s;ine&s;s of all pure and holy beings? If &s;o, all men, yea, every rational creature in the univer&s;e is obligated imme|diately to exerci&s;e a &s;imilar di&s;po&s;ition toward God, and from the &s;ame con&s;ideration. Becau&s;e, what is &s;uitable for one order of rational beings, is &s;o for another, &s;ince there is but one law and one lawgiver. Hence the argu|ment from analogy is conclu&s;ive, in e&s;tabli&s;hing our indi&s;|pen&s;ible obligation to give thanks to God; becau&s;e he hath taken to him&s;elf his great power and doth reign,
<PB N="30" REF="038304_0030_10119D794CABD1F8">
and that we, and all creatures and things, are under his admini&s;tration and ab&s;olute control.</P>
<P>Another obligation of gratitude ari&s;es from the infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the divine government. God be|ing infinitely powerful, wi&s;e and good, the plan of admin|i&s;tration which he hath adopted mu&s;t be the be&s;t. To de|ny this, would be to deny the perfections of God Perfec|tion will act like it&s;elf, and hence, any other government than that which embraces the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible good, all things con&s;idered, is unworthy of Jehovah. Here then is an ob|ject &s;ufficiently excellent to awaken every &s;oul to the live|lie&s;t thank&s;giving. It is the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;y&s;tem of govern|ing and di&s;po&s;ing of all beings and worlds. As our obliga|tion to love God re&s;ults from the moral excellency of his character, &s;o one of the principal &s;prings of gratitude origin|ates from the con&s;ideration that he takes to him&s;elf his great power and reigns in infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. In the view of this particular, it will be obligatory for ever on all finite beings to exerci&s;e the highe&s;t &s;trains of thank&s;giving, and this a&s;ide from every thing &s;ini&s;ter. To do it, will be the glory and felicity of the &s;potle&s;s ho&s;ts of heaven, and to refu&s;e it, will be the mi&s;ery and torment of the wicked in hell. A farther con&s;ideration, which lays us under in|crea&s;ing obligation to give thanks to God that we, and all creatures and things, are under his admini&s;tration and ab|&s;olute control, is, that this is the &s;ource whence all true happine&s;s &s;prings. Separate from a full per&s;ua&s;ion and be|lief that God reigns, the glorified &s;pirits above and all Chri&s;|tians would &s;ink into a &s;tate of wretchedne&s;s. If it be given up that God reigns, then it mu&s;t be granted, either that &s;ome other being reigns, or that events are at the di&s;po&s;al of blind chance. On either of the&s;e hypothe&s;es, what have the friends of God to rejoice their hearts, what have they to expect? If fatan governs, nothing but the fruits of ma|levolence can be in pro&s;pect. And if the affairs of the univer&s;e are left to the guidance of chance, our very exi&s;t|ence is ca&s;ualty, and every expectation of good to come is vain and groundle&s;s. But, ble&s;&s;ed be God, the affairs of the univer&s;e are not &s;o circum&s;tanced. All government

is his. He hath taken to him&s;elf his great power and doth reign. Here is happine&s;s, here is comfort for the friends of Zion. "<HI>The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoice, let the multitudes of the i&s;les be glad.</HI>" In this belief there is no room for de&s;pondency. In the darke&s;t hour, under the greate&s;t pre&s;&s;ure of affliction, there is joy for the upright in heart. "<HI>Altho the fig-tree &s;hall not blo&s;&s;om, neither &s;hall fruit be in the vine, the labor of the olive &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ail; and the fields &s;hall yield no meat, the flock &s;hall be cut from the fold, and their &s;hall be no herd in the &s;hall; Yet I will re|joice in the Lord, and joy in the God of my &s;alvation.</HI>" The divine government, therefore, being the principal &s;ource, whence all holy intelligences do and will forever derive their felicity, it is &s;uitable the grateful incen&s;e of our hearts &s;hould a&s;cend to God, that we, and all creatures and things, are under his admini&s;tration and ab&s;olute control.</P>

our privileges, and numerous attempts have been made to deprive us of them. Times not a few, thick darkne&s;s has hovered over our heads, and we have been threaten|ed with deva&s;tation and death.

It is thy claim, and our rea&s;onable &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Before I clo&s;e the &s;ubject, I cannot omit bringing up to your recollection the marvellous work of God in the conver&s;ion of &s;inners within the compa&s;s of the pre&s;ent year. Converts have been multiplied in places in every direction. Mini&s;ters and mi&s;&s;ionaries have been wonder|fully ble&s;&s;ed. Saints have &s;houted for joy, and Chri&s;t has been glorified. But, not to burthen your memories and &s;well the di&s;cour&s;e to an undue length, the di&s;play of God's &s;overeign grace in this town, to which you have been eye witne&s;&s;es, calls for the grateful emotions of your &s;ouls, and all that is within you. When we contemplate the ori|gin of this refre&s;hing from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, the di&s;mal night of &s;tupidity and darkne&s;s which preceded it, and the in&s;ufficiency of means and in&s;truments to effect any thing of the kind, we are nece&s;&s;itated to a&s;cribe the whole to the reigning power of almighty God.

Lord hath wrought wonderfully, becau&s;e "<HI>he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and compa&s;&s;ion on whom he will have compa&s;&s;ion.</HI> Not to acknowledge his &s;overeign|ty in this matter, implies a heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. You will not he&s;itate to &s;ay: "<HI>It is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</HI>" How precious the blood of Chri&s;t, and how infinite his grace to pave the way for &s;uch a work! The &s;alvation of one &s;inner in point of importance, is as far beyond every thing temporal, as the heavens are high above the earth. And have you come prepared to give God the glory which is due to his name? In looking and pondering on the matter, let us never forget, that this work hath been wrought becau&s;e, he hath taken to him&s;elf his great power and hath reigned. This being true, there is every encour|agement for prayer. All hearts are in his hand and he can turn them whither&s;oever he will. Does God thus reign, and are the fruits of his government &s;uch? We ought to be humble in the du&s;t, that we have not &s;een more of it, been more delighted with it, and prai&s;ed him in higher notes of thank&s;giving. Is the Lord &s;uch a God? re&s;olve this day to be entirely his.</P>
