<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following letter was written in the year <HI>1776,</HI> at the reque&s;t of an American gentleman, who de&s;ired to know my &s;entiments upon the &s;la|very of the Negroes, and profe&s;&s;ed an intention of re&s;toring all his own to liberty, could he be convinced that duty required the &s;acrifice. I therefore &s;ent him the following e&s;&s;ay, the imperfections of which may perhaps be &s;omething extenuated by the precipitation with which it was written. It has lain by me many years in ob&s;curity; nor did I choo&s;e to produce it during the progre&s;s of the American conte&s;t. Since the happy termination of that di&s;a&s;trous war, I have &s;hewn it to &s;ome of my particular friends, who have honored me &s;o far as to de&s;ire copies, and to &s;ugge&s;t that its publi|cation might not be unattended with utility. After reflecting upon the &s;ub|ject, I have cho&s;en to comply with their wi&s;hes, and pre&s;ent this fragment to the public; becau&s;e, whatever di&s;credit it brings upon my head, it may contribute to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;incerity of my heart: And if a &s;ingle human being &s;hould by my means be re&s;tored to happine&s;s, it is an ample recompence for all the dangers I may incur as an author. Should this e&s;&s;ay ever reach America, it may perhaps di&s;plea&s;e tho&s;e who have not learned to di&s;cern friends from flatterers, and to di&s;tingui&s;h between the language of truth and calumny. Tho&s;e, on the contrary, who are enlightened by a more exten&s;ive knowledge of human nature, may perhaps re&s;pect an Engli&s;hman, who, after daring to a&s;&s;ert their cau&s;e through all the varied events of the late revolution, dares now with equal intrepidity a&s;&s;ert the cau&s;e of truth and ju&s;tice, and of that part of the human &s;pecies who&s;e wrongs are yet unre|dre&s;&s;ed, and almo&s;t unpitied. Should it be a&s;ked why I rather publi&s;h a fragment than a complete e&s;&s;ay, I can only an&s;wer, that I re&s;pect truth &s;o much, that I am not inclined to violate it even as an author; and that this letter having been really written in the year <HI>1776,</HI> and being &s;till in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the gentleman to whom it was &s;ent, I do not choo&s;e to piece it with additions in the year <HI>1784</HI>&punc;</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed at receiving a letter, in an unknown hand, which de&s;ired me to give my &s;entiments relative to the &s;lavery of the Negroes; till reading to the end, I recollected the name of a gentleman, whom I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing with Mr. Laurens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Colonel John Laurens, &s;on of Henry Laurens, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> formerly pre&s;ident of the Con|gre&s;s. This young gentleman was &s;ent over to England for his education, where he endeared him&s;elf to all who knew him, by his abilities and affectionate temper. In the beginning of the year 1777, he joined the American army, and from that time was foremo&s;t is every danger. He was pre&s;ent and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in every action of the army under general Wa&s;hington, and was among the foremo&s;t that entered the Briti&s;h lines at York-Town. He fell Augu&s;t 27, 1782, one of the la&s;t victims to this di&s;a&s;trous war, in an ob&s;cure &s;kirmi&s;h with a foraging party. For &s;everal days pre|ceding the action, he had been confined to his bed by a raging fever, but left it at the call of duty, and met his death.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who were intimately acquainted with this young man, will rank his martial qualities, by which he was chiefly known, as lowe&s;t in the catalogue of his virtues. They will lament the untimely lo&s;s of a clear di&s;cerning mind that united the &s;olid powers of the under&s;tanding with inflexible integrity. In him, his country has lo&s;t one of its noble&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful citizens; his father the kinde&s;t and mo&s;t affectionate friend; and all the wretched a generous and di&s;intere&s;ted patron.&mdash;O my unfortu|nate country! mu&s;t I add, that when I con&s;ider all the leaders of thy factions, all thy hereditary magi&s;trates, all that are de&s;tined to engro&s;s thy dignities or share thy &s;poils, I &s;eek in vain a colonel John Laurens?</P></NOTE>. Much as I am flattered by finding my opinion of any con&s;equence with a gentleman of whom I have heard &s;o advantageous a character, I am &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed, that he can a&s;k it on &s;uch a que&s;tion; a que&s;tion which I am &s;ure his own humanity and good &s;en&s;e will be &s;ufficient to decide, if he attends, for a moment, to their dictates. I re&s;pect you, &s;ir, too much to doubt the &s;incerity of the declaration you make, when you profe&s;s to be guided by rea&s;on and morality upon this que&s;tion; for this is the only arbitration which any man can have to con&s;ult upon a &s;ubject like this: Where they are &s;ilent, the voice of the whole world ought to be di&s;regarded, and where they approve, the di&s;&s;ent of all mankind can have no influence upon a mind like yours.&mdash;But as you expre&s;sly de&s;ire to know my &s;enti|ments, I mu&s;t wave both preface and ceremony, and addre&s;s you with the mode&s;t freedom that becomes one man when he is &s;peaking to another upon the mo&s;t important que&s;tion in the univer&s;e. As a member of that &s;ociety which has now made a &s;olemn appeal to Heaven, and taken up arms again&s;t the nation to which it owes its e&s;tabli&s;hment, you mu&s;t admit that there are &s;uch things as right and ju&s;tice, to which the whole human &s;pecies have an indefea&s;ible claim. Indeed, unle&s;s there be &s;uch a thing as ju&s;tice, it is in vain we enquire about its precepts, or refer to its arbitration. He that admits no right but force, no ju&s;tice but &s;upe|rior violence, arms every man again&s;t him&s;elf, and ju&s;tifies all exce&s;&s;es. If it be lawful to injure becau&s;e we can; if we may &s;eize the property of another, in&s;ult his per&s;on, or force him to labour for our luxury or ca|price, merely becau&s;e he is weaker; this principle will be equally fatal to our&s;elves, when fortune &s;hall &s;trip us of that power which is our only prerogative, and &s;hift the plea of &s;uperiority. You are to remember that, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, your &s;laves, the in&s;tant they &s;hall become the &s;tronge&s;t, will have a right to the &s;ervices of your&s;elf and every other gen|tleman of the &s;outhern colonies; will have a right to force you to labour naked in the &s;un to the mu&s;ic of whips and chains; to rob you of every thing which is now dear to your indolence, or nece&s;&s;ary to your plea&s;ures; to goad you to every &s;pecies of &s;ervile drudgery, and puni&s;h you for their amu&s;ement and caprice; will have a right to exhau&s;t your youth in &s;ervi|tude, and to abandon your age to wretchedne&s;s and di&s;ea&s;es: In one word, &s;ir, they will have a right to u&s;e <HI>you,</HI> as you do <HI>them.</HI> Let us, therefore, leave principles which can be maintained by no one but a profe&s;&s;ed ene|my to mankind; who would at one &s;troke extirpate every thing which alleviates the evils of life, and arm every man in an eternal war again&s;t his fellow creatures, to enquire what are the real dictates of that ju&s;tice,
<PB N="4" REF="044524_0004_101EB1F708C14D70">
who&s;e exi&s;tence, I am per&s;uaded, we both allow. You, therefore, admit there are certain claims, which, for want of a better name, we call rights, to which the human &s;pecies has an indi&s;putable title. To expre&s;s my&s;elf in other words, "There is a method of pur&s;uing our own happine&s;s in &s;uch a manner, that we may promote the general good at the &s;ame time; or, at lea&s;t, not interfere with it." This, our rea&s;on a&s;&s;ures us, is the privilege of every created being; and while he confines him&s;elf within the&s;e bounds, we feel the mo&s;t cordial approbation of his conduct. We love, and e&s;teem, and &s;ympathize with him, from the very con&s;titution of our nature. On the contrary, whenever any one di&s;turbs or injures a being acting in this manner, or prevents him from attaining the good to which he is impelled, we feel our hatred and indignation mo&s;t forcibly excited again&s;t the aggre&s;&s;or. We con&s;ider &s;uch a character as armed again&s;t the welfare of the world, and as one who is endeavouring to make the common good &s;ub&s;ervient to his own &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. I appeal to the ge|nero&s;ity of your own nature, for the exi&s;tence of the&s;e principles. Have they not, a thou&s;and times, animated you to acts of virtue and humanity, as well as in&s;pired you with an involuntary reverence for all who acted from their impul&s;e? Have they not often pleaded the cau&s;e of the wretch that lay trembling and defencele&s;s at your feet, and, in &s;pite of the pre|judices of your country and education, whi&s;pered to your mind that one human being ought not to hold his exi&s;tence by the tenure of another's will? Do not the&s;e principles now in&s;pire you, and frequently impel you beyond the bounds of prudence and &s;afety, while what you call your country's cau&s;e animates you to exertion? But this cau&s;e is only the united cau&s;e and intere&s;t of every particular man; tho&s;e rights which the Great Creator taught him to di&s;cover when he gave him rea&s;on, which he urges him to defend by pa&s;&s;ion, and which a mind like yours prizes beyond all the gratifications of &s;en&s;e, and dares to gra&s;p at even while it is peri&s;hing. This appears to me to be a plain and conci&s;e deduction of morality, which means nothing more than that method or rule of conduct by which the whole human &s;pecies may attain the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree of happine&s;s. And I rather choo&s;e to expre&s;s my&s;elf &s;o, becau&s;e I thus comprehend all &s;ects and opinions. The religious man allows that the happine&s;s of the &s;pecies is the great end of the Deity, which he promotes by the rewards and puni&s;hments of a future &s;tate: The di&s;ciple of Shaft&s;bury under&s;tands this, when he talks of the beauty of virtue and the love of order; and even the gloomy pupil of Hobbes, who re&s;olves every thing into &s;elf intere&s;t, mu&s;t allow the exi&s;tence of moral di&s;tinctions, &s;o far as they influence the welfare of the &s;pecies. This univer&s;al morality appears to me to be the only rational and legal foundation of all human government; which ought to be nothing more than the application of this general rule to particular &s;ocieties, and the enforcing it by civil e&s;ta|bli&s;hments. If, therefore, it be granted, that the rights of a nation are nothing more than the rights of every man in it, and that all ju&s;t and legal authority &s;uppo&s;es a delegated power entru&s;ted &s;olely for the purpo&s;e of promoting the general good; it will appear evident that every indivi|dual in the univer&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es certain rights, which no man can dive&s;t him of without inju&s;tice, unle&s;s he be guilty of &s;ome crime again&s;t &s;ociety which expo&s;es him to its vengeance. Hence it follows, that whenever any nation attacks the rights and happine&s;s of another nation, it de&s;erves to find its own de&s;truction in the attempt; and whenever any individual pre&s;umes to exerci&s;e this &s;pecies of authority over his fellow creatures, he mu&s;t be a tyrant and an oppre&s;&s;or whom it is permitted to de&s;troy by eve|ry po&s;&s;ible method. Whoever would deny this, mu&s;t either deny the ex|i&s;tence of right and ju&s;tice entirely, and then it is in vain to argue; or mu&s;t &s;hew &s;ome natural di&s;tinction by which one part of the &s;pecies is en|titled to privileges from which the other is excluded. The fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;i|tion I have already con&s;idered, and the &s;econd is altogether ab&s;urd; for all
<PB N="5" REF="044524_0005_101EB21C8059EF70">
alterations and di&s;tinctions among mankind &s;olely ari&s;e from civil govern|ment, which has no other ju&s;t foundation than natural right; and natural right, for that rea&s;on, mu&s;t be a principle of higher authority than civil government. Whenever, therefore, civil government tends to de&s;troy and confound the rights of nature, it cea&s;es to have any claim to our obedi|ence; it becomes tyranny, corruption, and de&s;poti&s;m, a pe&s;t in&s;tead of a ble&s;&s;ing, and &s;ubver&s;ive of every purpo&s;e for which it was in&s;tituted, or ought to be continued.</P>
<P>I am extremely fearful of expre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf ob&s;curely upon &s;o ab&s;tract a &s;ubject, and mu&s;t, therefore, though with the hazard of prolixity, at|tempt to place it in a different light.&mdash;If you imagine any number of the human &s;pecies a&s;&s;embled in &s;ome particular part of the globe, without any form of government e&s;tabli&s;hed among them; it is evident, that the&s;e individuals may either live together in &s;uch a manner as to produce mutual comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or may be the cau&s;e of continual mi&s;ery to each other. No propo&s;ition in the mathematics can be inve&s;tigated with more preci&s;ion than the methods of conduct which have the&s;e con|trary tendencies. Every di&s;po&s;ition which inclines one man to a&s;&s;i&s;t ano|ther, or to avoid giving him offence and doing him injury, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily contribute to the common welfare; which would be perfect, were the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions cultivated in the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree. On the contrary, every di&s;po&s;ition, which, either by fraud or violence, tends to interrupt the per&s;onal &s;ecurity of individuals, or to deprive them of tho&s;e things which they have acquired by their indu&s;try, is detrimental to the &s;um of happine&s;s, and would, if carried to the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree, entirely de&s;troy that part of the &s;pecies.&mdash;In this view of things, morality ari&s;es from nece&s;&s;ity, and comprehends "certain rules of conduct founded upon the relations which beings endowed with particular faculties bear to each other; which rules, when properly ob&s;erved, produce happine&s;s to &s;ociety; but when violated or neglected, as nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion mi&s;ery as fire or pointed &s;ub&s;tances excite pain, when they act too forcibly upon the nerves."</P>
<P>I hardly think that the greate&s;t &s;ceptic will deny the&s;e di&s;tinctions, founded upon facts as certain as the impre&s;&s;ion of any material &s;ub&s;tance upon our &s;en&s;es. If we, now, proceed a little farther, we &s;hall find that the di&s;po&s;itions which produce the&s;e different kinds of conduct are by the morali&s;ts expre&s;&s;ed by different names, and enforced by different motives, according to their &s;everal &s;y&s;tems; while natural religion adds its &s;ancti|ons, and inclines us to believe that the Deity him&s;elf, who has di&s;played &s;o great an attention to the happine&s;s and pre&s;ervation of his creatures here, may extend his benevolence to another &s;tage of exi&s;tence, and com|pen&s;ate the evils &s;ometimes unmeritedly &s;uffered below. But if we admit the evidence of revealed religion, the &s;cheme of human things is perfect as it is augu&s;t; the clouds which over&s;hadowed our horizon are di&s;&s;ipat|ed, and the gradual progre&s;s of triumphant virtue, through dangers and difficulties, to eternal happine&s;s, is di&s;played and a&s;certained.</P>
<P>Having laid down the&s;e principles, it is ea&s;y to apply them to the par|ticular ca&s;e in que&s;tion. Slavery is the ab&s;olute dependence of one man upon another; and is, therefore, as incon&s;i&s;tent with all ideas of ju&s;tice as de&s;poti&s;m is with the rights of nature. It is a crime &s;o mon&s;trous again&s;t the human &s;pecies, that all tho&s;e who practi&s;e it de&s;erve to be ex|tirpated from the earth. It is no little, indirect attack upon the &s;afety and happine&s;s of our fellow creatures, but one that boldly &s;trikes at the foundations of all humanity and ju&s;tice. Robbers invade the property, and murderers the life of human beings; but he that holds another man in bondage, &s;ubjects the whole &s;um of his exi&s;tence to oppre&s;&s;ion, bereaves him of every hope, and is, therefore, more dete&s;table than robber and a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;in combined. But if no one who has common feeling will commit the outrage, no one who has common &s;en&s;e will attempt to ju&s;tify it by ar|gument;
<PB N="6" REF="044524_0006_101EB21E0B7F0610">
&s;ince it would involve him in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t inextricable contradictions. He mu&s;t allow that every man has, by nature, a right to life, yet that every other man has a right to rob him of it; that every man has an equal right to &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, yet that every other may deprive him of all the means; and that while every individual is ju&s;tified by na|ture and the Deity in pur&s;uing his own happine&s;s by all innocent methods, every other individual is equally ju&s;tified in making him mi&s;erable. In &s;hort, it is reducing every thing to the &s;tate before de&s;cribed, a &s;tate of conte&s;t and de&s;olation from which right and ju&s;tice are equally excluded.</P>
<P>Of you, &s;ir, who &s;ay you have &s;everal &s;laves, I beg leave to a&s;k what are the rights you claim over them? Have you a right to torture them when they are guilty of no faults? Have you a right to kill them for your diver&s;ion? Is your power circum&s;cribed by no bounds, and are there particular beings who bring into the world all the rights which you your&s;elf can pretend to, but have &s;o entirely lo&s;t them by being tran&s;port|ed into another country, as to be beyond the protection both of nature and of nature's God?</P>
<P>Surely, &s;ir, unle&s;s I am deceived in you, you are a man both of honor and humanity. You &s;tart at the idea of wanton and unprovoked bar|barity. You would not murther a &s;lave to &s;hew your dexterity, nor maim him to prove your &s;trength; you would not da&s;h an infant upon the ground to feed your dogs, even tho' he was black; nor would you rip up the belly of his mother while &s;he was &s;uckling him, to improve your &s;kill in anatomy. You neither would, nor <HI>dare</HI> you commit actions like the&s;e; you feel that you have no right to do them; or, if you have, that every other man has an equal and &s;uperior right to de&s;troy you like a bea&s;t of prey. What then are your rights? I anticipate your an&s;wer: You will feed and cloath your Negroes, you will treat them with hu|manity and tenderne&s;s, and then you have a right to moderate advantage from their labors. All this, &s;ir, is well; and could I conceive you ever had acted in another manner, I &s;hould never have troubled you with this tedious letter. While your Negroes choo&s;e to &s;tay with you upon the&s;e terms, this is a fair and equitable compact. But what if they &s;hould choo&s;e to leave you, will you let them go? If you do, you are a man of honor, &s;en&s;e, and humanity; but I fear no We&s;t Indian.</P>
<P>Are there no whips, no gibbets, no puni&s;hments more dreadful than death it&s;elf for contumacious &s;laves? And what is this but claiming the dete&s;table power I have mentioned above, that of making other beings mi&s;erable, for your intere&s;t or amu&s;ement? Who, &s;ir, gave you a title to their labours, or a right to confine them to loath&s;ome drudgery? And if you have no right to this, what are the puni&s;hments you pretend to in|flict but &s;o many additional outrages? Has a robber a claim upon your life becau&s;e you withhold your property; or a ravi&s;her a right to a wo|man's blood becau&s;e &s;he defends her cha&s;tity? Either then prove your right to their labours, or acknowledge that the puni&s;hments inflicted upon fugitive &s;laves are a flagitious in&s;ult upon ju&s;tice, humanity and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Permit me, here, to examine for a moment the nature of the title by which you claim an irredeemable property in the labours of your fellow creatures.&mdash;A wretch, devoid of compa&s;&s;ion and under&s;tanding, who calls him&s;elf a king of &s;ome part of Africa which &s;uffers the calamity of be|ing frequented by the Europeans, &s;eizes his innocent &s;ubjects, or engages in an unnece&s;&s;ary war to furni&s;h him&s;elf with pri&s;oners; the&s;e are loaded with chains, torn from all their comforts and connections, and driven (like bea&s;ts to the &s;laughter hou&s;e) down to the &s;ea &s;hore, where the mild &s;ubjects of a Chri&s;tian government and a religious king are waiting to a|gree for the purcha&s;e, and to tran&s;port them to America. They are then thru&s;t by hundreds into the infectious hold of a &s;hip, in which the greate&s;t part frequently peri&s;hes by di&s;ea&s;e, while the re&s;t are re&s;erved to experience
<PB N="7" REF="044524_0007_101EB220EDF4E098">
the candor and humanity of American patriots&mdash;If you have never yet con&s;idered it, pau&s;e here for a moment, and endeavour to impre&s;s upon your mind the feelings of a being full as &s;en&s;ible, and perhaps more in|nocent than you or I, which is thus torn in an in&s;tant from every thing that makes life agreeable; from country, friends and parents; from the intercour&s;e of mutual affection with mi&s;tre&s;s, lover, or child; which, po&s;&s;e&s;t of feelings more exqui&s;ite than European hearts can conceive, is &s;eparated for ever from all it loves; that, reduced to a depth of mi&s;ery, which, even in the mid&s;t of freedom and affluence, would be &s;ufficient to overwhelm the mo&s;t hardened di&s;po&s;ition, in&s;tead of friends and comfort|ers, and ob&s;equious attendants, &s;ees it&s;elf &s;urrounded with unrelenting per|&s;ecutors and unpitying enemies; wretches who, by long intercour&s;e with mi&s;ery, are grown callous to its agonies; who an&s;wer tears with taunts, and complaints with torture! I &s;hudder at the horrors which I de&s;cribe, and blu&s;h to be a human creature! Yet the&s;e are not the colours of de&s;|cription, but a recital of facts le&s;s &s;trong than the reality. Can any man reflect upon the&s;e things, without unutterable remor&s;e? Can he know that, perhaps, while he is wallowing in luxury and &s;en&s;uality, there are beings who&s;e exi&s;tence he has embittered, mothers &s;hrieking for their children, and children peri&s;hing for want of their mothers care; wretches who are frantic with rage, &s;hame and de&s;peration, or pining in all the agonies of &s;low and painful death, who might have been at peace if he had never exi&s;ted? Can any man know this and hope for mercy, either from his fellow creatures or his God?&mdash;After the arrival of the &s;urviving wretches in America, you well know in what manner they are tran&s;ferred to their con&s;cientious ma&s;ters&mdash;how they are brought to the market, na|ked, weeping, and in chains&mdash;how one man dares to examine his fellow creatures as he would do bea&s;ts, and bargain for their per&s;ons&mdash;how all the mo&s;t &s;acred duties, affections, and feelings of the human heart, are violated and in&s;ulted; and thus you dare to call your&s;elves the ma&s;ters of wretches whom you have acquired by fraud, and retain by violence!&mdash;While I am tracing this practice, which you and every man who has been in the i&s;lands or the &s;outhern colonies of America, knows to be true, my a&s;toni&s;hment exceeds even my horror, to find it po&s;&s;ible that any one &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly doubt whether an equitable title to hold human beings in bondage can be thus acquired.</P>
<P>With what face, &s;ir, can he who has never re&s;pected the rights of nature in another, pretend to claim them in his own favour? How dare the in|habitants of the &s;outhern colonies &s;peak of privileges and ju&s;tice? Is money of &s;o much more importance than life? Or have the Americans &s;hared the di&s;pen&s;ing power of St. Peter's &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to excu&s;e their own ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e rules which they impo&s;e on others? If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, &s;igning re&s;olu|tions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandi&s;hing a whip over his affrighted &s;laves.</P>
<P>If men would be con&s;i&s;tent, they mu&s;t admit all the con&s;equences of their own principles; and you and your countrymen are reduced to the dilemma of either acknowledging the rights of your Negroes, or of &s;ur|rendering your own.&mdash;If there be certain natural and univer&s;al rights, as the declarations of your Congre&s;s &s;o repeatedly affirm, I wonder how the unfortunate Africans have incurred their forfeiture.&mdash;Is it the antiquity, or the virtues, or the great qualities of the Engli&s;h Americans, which con&s;titutes the difference, and entities them to rights from which they to|tally exclude more than a fourth part of the &s;pecies?&mdash;Or do you choo&s;e to make u&s;e of that argument, which the great Monte&s;quieu has thrown out as the &s;evere&s;t ridicule, that they are black and you white; that you have lank, long hair, while theirs is &s;hort and woolly?</P>
<P>The more attentively you con&s;ider this &s;ubject, the more clearly you will percieve, that every plea, which can be advanced upon it, is the plea of

intere&s;t and tyranny combating humanity and truth. You cannot hide from your&s;elf, that every title you can alledge mu&s;t be a title founded upon fraud or violence, and &s;upported by open and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> inju&s;tice. Can any thing be clearer, than that a man who is born free can never forfeit his inheritance by &s;uffering oppre&s;&s;ion; and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">diction to urge a purcha&s;e of what no one has a right to &s;ell? Nor does it make any difference, whether the unfortunate victim <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> from one to another, or from one to a thou&s;and ma&s;ters, any more than whether a nation be en&s;laved by a fir&s;t, or by an hundredth tyrant. There can be no pre|&s;cription pleaded again&s;t truth and ju&s;tice; and the continuance of the evil is &s;o far from ju&s;tifying, that it is an exaggeration of the crime. What would you &s;ay to a man, in private life, who &s;hould pretend to be no thief, becau&s;e he only bought &s;tolen goods; or that he was no villain, becau&s;e he did not forge a deed him&s;elf, but only paid another to do it, and enjoyed the e&s;tate by that honorable &s;ecurity? Yet this is literally the title which the Americans plead to the unfortunate inhabitants of Africa. You do not go to Africa to buy or &s;teal your Negroes; perhaps, becau&s;e you are too lazy and luxurious: but you encourage an infamous, pitile&s;s race of men to do it for you, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly receive the fruits of their crimes. You do not, merciful men, reduce your fellow creatures to &s;ervitude! No, men of your independent &s;pirits, that have taken up arms again&s;t the government that had protected and e&s;tabli&s;hed them, ra|ther than pay a tax of three pence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that have laid the axe to the root of all human authority, and in&s;tead of drinking the bitter waters of civil abu&s;es and pre&s;criptive obedience, have a&s;cended to the living fountains of truth, ju&s;tice and nature, would never make flagitious attempts upon the liberties and happine&s;s of their brethren! Yes, gentlemen, men of liberal minds like yours, acknowledge all mankind to be their equals. Leave hereditary tyrants and their flatterers to make di&s;tinctions un|known to nature, and to degrade one part of the &s;pecies to brutes, while they equal the other with gods!&mdash;You know that this is the greate&s;t of all corruptions, and as &s;uch you dete&s;t it.&mdash;What! are not all men naturally equal? And are not all civil di&s;tinctions, when legitimate the permi&s;&s;ion of the people, and con&s;equently &s;ubordinate to their power and controul? Did you not carry the rights of men into the uncultivated de&s;art and the howling wilderne&s;s? Not of Frenchmen, nor of Ger|mans, nor of Engli&s;hmen, but of men;&mdash;men, the fir&s;t and &s;upreme di&s;|&s;tinction, who, created for freedom and happine&s;s, tran&s;port to every &s;oil the inherent prerogatives of their nature.</P>
<P>"Rome n'e&s;t plus dans Rome, elle e&s;t par tout o&ugrave; je &s;uis."</P>
<P>Yes, gentlemen, as you are no longer Engli&s;hmen, I hope you will plea&s;e to be men; and, as &s;uch, admit the whole human &s;pecies to a parti|cipation of your unalienable rights. You will not, therefore, drag a trembling wretch from his cottage and his family; you will not tear the child from the arms of his frantic mother, that they may drag on a loath|&s;ome exi&s;tence in mi&s;ery and chains; you will not make depredations up|on your unoffending neighbours, and, after having &s;pread de&s;olation over a fertile country, reduce the innocent inhabitants to &s;ervitude. To do this, you mu&s;t be mon&s;ters, wor&s;e, I fear, than the majority of the Hou&s;e of Commons and the Engli&s;h Mini&s;try<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Should this doubt appear ab&s;urd, the reader is de&s;ired to remember it was writ|ten in the year 1776.</NOTE>. But you are men tremblingly alive to all the rights and feelings of the kind, and I believe &s;ome of you at lea&s;t are Chri&s;tians. Your wor&s;t actions, therefore, the greate&s;t crimes which even your enemies can object, are only that you are the voluntary cau&s;es of all the&s;e mi&s;chiefs?&mdash;You, you encourage the Engli&s;h pirate to violate the laws of faith and ho&s;pitality, and &s;timulate him to new ex|ce&s;&s;es by purcha&s;ing the fruits of his rapine. Your avarice is the torch of treachery and civil war, which de&s;olates the &s;hores of Africa, and &s;hakes de&s;truction on half the majestic &s;pecies of man! . . . . . . .</P>
