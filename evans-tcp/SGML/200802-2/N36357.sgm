<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>OVID'S <HI>Art of Love,</HI> having lately appeared in <HI>French</HI> with <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> written by the tran&s;la|tor, which have been very well received in <HI>France;</HI> it has been thought proper to add &s;uch of them as are mo&s;t curious to this <HI>ver&s;ion,</HI> and to make other new <HI>remarks</HI> in &s;ome places, where the <HI>Engli&s;h tran&s;lators</HI> have gi|ven another <HI>turn</HI> to the <HI>original.</HI> The <HI>introduction</HI> to the&s;e <HI>ob&s;ervations</HI> is entirely the <HI>French</HI> author's; &s;o are mo&s;t of the reflections. 'Tis hop'd tho&s;e that are not ta|ken from him, will not be found to be of le&s;s importance than tho&s;e that are&punc;</P>
<P>A great many people are mi&s;taken in the&s;e books: and though they were made u&s;e of as a pretence to drive the author from the court of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and confine him to <HI>Tomos,</HI> on the frontiers of the <HI>Getae</HI> and <HI>Surmatae,</HI> yet they were not the true cau&s;e of his confinement. They are very far from being &s;o licentious as the writings of &s;everal other poets, both <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI> However, we mu&s;t own he might have been a little more di&s;creet, e&s;pecially in &s;ome places.</P>
<P>That which offended the <HI>Romans</HI> mo&s;t in this work, cannot touch us. It has always been more dangerous in <HI>Italy</HI> to conver&s;e with women of honour, and frequent their hou&s;es, than 'tis with us: Though there is more li|berty, and what in that country may be an occa&s;ion of debauchery, would not at all be &s;o in ours.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid again&s;t the&s;e books <HI>of the Art of Love,</HI> by &s;ome over-&s;crupulous per|&s;ons, who&s;e di&s;cretion has too much of affectation in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; they are not only nece&s;&s;ary for the knowledge of the <HI>La|tin</HI> tongue, and the <HI>Roman</HI> hi&s;tory, concerning which they contain &s;everal things very particular; but for the no|ble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we find in them, which the mo&s;t <HI>grave</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> have thought worthy to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="047526_0005_1023BD6573B6AD90">
In a word, there's nothing in them that comes near the <HI>licence</HI> of &s;ome <HI>epigrams</HI> of <HI>Catullus Martial,</HI> and <HI>Au|&s;onius,</HI> of &s;ome <HI>&s;atyrs</HI> of <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Juvenal,</HI> and &s;eve|ral other pieces of <HI>ancient</HI> and <HI>modern</HI> authors which are read and commented upon; and about which even cele|brated <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> and other religious per&s;ons, as eminent for their piety as their erudition, have employed their &s;tu|dies. Yet who has condemn'd or complain'd of them? We mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;uch things &s;hould be manag'd with addre&s;s: and tho&s;e of them who have meddled with any of the authors I have named, have &s;hewn that it may be done &s;o, by their &s;ucceeding &s;o happily in it.</P>
<P>As for this treati&s;e of the <HI>Art of Love,</HI> for which the author has al&s;o pre&s;crib'd a <HI>remedy,</HI> as it is liable to be all interpreted by tho&s;e who&s;e pens poi&s;on every thing they touch; &s;o it may bear a good con&s;truction, by &s;uch as know how to turn every thing to advantage.</P>
<P>I will yet &s;ay, this <HI>Art</HI> may be apply'd to tho&s;e that intend to marry. There is nothing &s;ure again&s;t decency in all that. I agree, if you will have it &s;o, that it ex|tends &s;o far as to direct one to the means to gain a mi&s;|tre&s;s. If this was not lawful heretofore in <HI>Italy,</HI> on ac|count of the jealous humour of the <HI>Italians,</HI> we cannot, for the &s;ame rea&s;on only, &s;ay it ought to be forbidden in our country, any more than in &s;everal others, provided we could be &s;ure the ladies mode&s;ty would not be offend|ed, before whom youth &s;hould be always careful not to exceed the bounds of the re&s;pect that's due to them.</P>
<P>Be it as it will, I have thought of endeavouring to ap|ply all that is &s;aid in tho&s;e books of wanton <HI>love,</HI> to the <HI>art</HI> of loving the <HI>&s;ciences.</HI> The <HI>emblem</HI> is not di&s;agreea|ble, neither is it impo&s;&s;ible to explain all that <HI>Ovid</HI> has written here upon the love of <HI>beauty</HI> by that of the <HI>arts.</HI> What do we not &s;ometimes under&s;tand by the loves of a &s;hepherd and &s;hepherde&s;s? By a lover of incomparable beauty, and his fair one pa&s;&s;ionately in love? But, keep|ing to the fable, how often has the loves of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and
<PB N="vii" REF="047526_0006_1023BD69AB0F5C78">
<HI>Juno</HI> been moraliz'd upon, as well as tho&s;e of <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Daphne, Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus, Myrrha</HI> and <HI>Cynaras,</HI> and &s;everal others, the examples of which are almo&s;t in|finite? Yet the&s;e things are &s;een every day, all the world read and admire them. Tho' the out&s;ide of them is a lit|tle &s;trong, and the literal &s;en&s;e more &s;u&s;pected, than any of the precepts laid down in <HI>Ovid's Art of Love</HI> are li|centious.</P>
<P>But, to &s;often this thought a little, let us figure to our&s;elves, that the poet is not only a <HI>gallant</HI> of the court of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> but a philo&s;opher of the <HI>Portic</HI> and <HI>Lyceum;</HI> who propo&s;es to us, as to his di&s;ciples, excellent rules to acquire the <HI>virtues</HI> and <HI>&s;ciences,</HI> repre&s;ented under the name of the <HI>mu&s;es,</HI> or ladies of various beauty, who may be met with every where, e&s;pecially in great academies, in the &s;chools, in courts, in walks, and in holy places; figured by <HI>cirques, theatres, galleries, portices,</HI> and the <HI>temples</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> deities, where great a&s;&s;emblies were held. And when we have cho&s;en that which plea&s;es us be&s;t, and is mo&s;t agreeable to our nature; let us en|deavour to gain its good graces, and enjoy it, that we may become more wi&s;e, and more virtuous. Thus we may deceive our imagination: and 'twill be ea&s;y for us to make the reading of this treati&s;e, not only plea&s;ant, but profitable. We need not then have any &s;cruple upon us, becau&s;e there is nothing uncha&s;te in the expre&s;&s;ion, though &s;uch things as are entirely gallant are not ne|glected; at lea&s;t no farther than mode&s;ty and decency requir'd. I will, if I can, explain my thoughts in this matter, according as occa&s;ion may offer.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Art of Love.</HI> By this we ought to under&s;tand how we mu&s;t love, or how we mu&s;t pre&s;erve the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of our love, when we have once acquir'd it. Otherwi&s;e 'twas u&s;ele&s;s to write an <HI>Art of love.</HI> For <HI>love</HI> is form'd in the heart without <HI>art,</HI> and all are without <HI>art</HI> &s;u&s;cep|tible of that pa&s;&s;ion. It generally &s;urprizes us, and we know not from whence it comes, though we feel it very &s;en&s;ibly. For this rea&s;on the poets &s;o often endeavour to
<PB N="viii" REF="047526_0007_1023BD6CE5BB5128">
per&s;uade us that <HI>love</HI> is a potent <HI>god,</HI> who wounds every thing with his darts; and that there is no creature able to re&s;i&s;t him. We therefore need no <HI>art</HI> to teach us to <HI>love,</HI> or even to <HI>love</HI> any thing rea&s;onably; but 'tis of very great importance to each of us, that, when we are in|&s;pir'd, the in&s;piration &s;hould be for a proper object, and a good end, as I de&s;ign to &s;hew you.</P>
<P><HI>Ovid.</HI> This poet wrote the&s;e books a few years before his exile, under colour of which the <HI>decree</HI> of the &s;enate for his bani&s;hment was procur'd&punc; though they certainly were not the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of it; and indeed could not rea&s;onably be &s;o, unle&s;s <HI>Ovid</HI> wrote them in favour of <HI>Augu&s;tus'</HI>s grand|daughter, whom he vi&s;ited with a little too much fami|liarity, and did it to plea&s;e her. For &s;he, no more than her mother, <HI>Agrippa'</HI>s wife, was not &s;o mode&s;t as per&s;ons of quality and high condition ought to be, as well for their own glory, as for an example to others.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t books of the <HI>Art of Love,</HI> contain the pre|cepts which the author lays down for young men to fol|low in their court&s;hip to the ladies, and the third teaches the ladies how they ought to make them&s;elves belov'd. The allegory is not unea&s;ily applied to the <HI>&s;ciences</HI> and the <HI>virtues,</HI> repre&s;ented as lovely women, after my way of imagining it.</P>
