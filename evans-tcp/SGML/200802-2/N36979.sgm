A de&s;erter coming in &s;oon after, informed them he was lying on the field, he be|lived not quite dead.&mdash;I immediately applied for a flag to go in &s;earch of him; but the orders was to march, and it could not be obtained. Our com|manding officer was newly put in, or this would not have been the ca&s;e.&mdash;Di&s;gu&s;ted with the brutality of our co|lonel, and a heart bleeding for my friend, I took the advantage of the night, and left the camp in &s;earch of him&mdash;it was near morning ere I found him. Alas! how can I de&s;cribe my feelings on &s;ee|ing him in &s;uch a &s;ituation. I took him in my arms to a river not far di&s;tant, wa&s;hed the blood from his face, and bound up his wounds with my hand|kerchief. After drinking a little water,
<PB N="12" REF="048426_0007_102547E1188D56E0">he &s;eemed to recover: I &s;aw a light at a di&s;tance, and endeavored to carry him to it; but I was deceived&mdash;it was only a vapour.</P>
<P>THE morn arrived, but with it no gleam of hope; I had wandered the whole day, &s;upporting my friend, I may &s;ay, carrying him; for he frequently fainted. I had at length brought him to the bank of the river, where Mi&s;s Villars found him. He had lo&s;t &s;o much blood, and was &s;o exhau&s;ted with en|deavoring to travel, that I thought he would have expired. He begged me to leave him, and take care of my&s;elf. &mdash;"My dear Harry," &s;aid he, "I feel I cannot live&mdash;why will you endanger your&s;elf&mdash;comfort my parents&mdash;farewell my friend."</P>
<P>I HAD not time to tell him, I would never leave him, when he again fainted. I ran for water to the river, when at my return, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, I beheld Mi&s;s Villars. Heaven had heard my prayer, and &s;ent relief when I had de&s;paired of finding it.&mdash;Mr. Villars and the Ladies, highly recommended Mr. Hargrave's humanity. The form|er

That as he was ever an enemy to di&s;&s;imulation, he would advi&s;e him to write to the general, and inform him of every circum&s;tance, and in the interim, to give him&s;elf up as a pri&s;oner of war; he made no doubt of his being very &s;oon exchanged."</P>
<P>THE young gentleman very politely thanked him for his advice, and &s;aid he would be entirely directed by him; then &s;eparated for the night, but not to &s;leep. Mr. and Mrs. Villars, though they &s;aw &s;omething in Mr. Hargrave that intere&s;ted them very much in his favor, they wi&s;hed to be more particu|larly acquainted with him.

Mr. Hargrave was &s;o rejoiced at his friend's recovery, that he forgot his own &s;ituation, until re|minded by Mr. Villars; who propo&s;ed going with him to his commanding officer, who&s;e quarters was not above twenty miles di&s;tance. The bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;oon &s;ettled; Mr. Villars procured for them leave of ab&s;ence, and they re|turned to the great &s;atisfaction of Cap|tain Bellmore, who was much more anxious for his friend than him&s;elf. After a few days, he was able to &s;it up; he begged Mr. Hargrave would intreat the Ladies permi&s;&s;ion for him to thank them in per&s;on, for the favors he had received: he complied with his reque&s;t. Mrs. Villars told him, &s;miling, "&s;he was happy his friend was well enough to &s;ee company; that they would do them|&s;elves the plea&s;ure of taking a di&s;h of tea with him that afternoon.&mdash;Loui&s;a ap|peared more lovely than u&s;ual; her dre&s;s, which was &s;implicity it&s;elf, added to charms, already heightened by the

At that moment, the little &s;paniel jumped on her lap, and licked her hands: Loui&s;a care&s;&s;ed him, and mentioned his coming to her on the bank of the river, and the ex|treme di&s;tre&s;s he &s;eemed in.

<P>Mr. SOMMERS had one day invited Captain Bellmore and his friend to dine.

"Tell me, I pray, if you know any thing of this Lady or her family; for be a&s;&s;ur|ed, though I have been taught to look on my&s;elf as the heir of Lord Beauclair, if ever I am &s;o happy as to find Lady Maria, I &s;hall willingly re&s;ign my pre|ten&s;ions in her favor."

<P>Mi&s;s SOMMERS was torn between love and friend&s;hip; &s;he knew Lady Maria Beverly; but was not at liberty to di&s;cover her; and if &s;he did, &s;he

Accordingly, as &s;oon as the cloth was removed, Mr. Villars began as follows:</P>
<P>MY father was the younge&s;t &s;on of an ancient family in Cumberland, of the name of Villars. My grandfather, at an advanced age, married a widow of &s;mall fortune; &s;he had one daughter, who was very beautiful; and her mother po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great deal of art, &s;oon made a match between her and my father's elder brother. She had great a&s;cendancy over my grandfather, and found means to withdraw his affection from his younger children.&mdash;My father and a &s;i&s;ter of twelve years of age, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="54" REF="048426_0028_1025482D268C9760">&s;ent to a boarding-&s;chool, and never allowed to come home. At my grand|father's death, they found them&s;elves thrown on the world, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very few hundreds.&mdash;Mi&s;s Villars took her father's u&s;age &s;o much to heart, that &s;he died not long after.&mdash;She was in her eighteenth year when this melancholy event took place. My father who was of a lively turn, &s;ubmitted to the ca|price of fortune, and &s;trove to be con|tent: he had &s;tudied the law, but did not pay &s;uch &s;trict attention to it as he ought.&mdash;When he had entered his two and twentieth year, a brother of my grandfather's mother died, and left my father an e&s;tate near Bath, of &s;ix hundred pounds a year; with which he was to take the name of Beverly. He &s;oon after married Mi&s;s Loui&s;a Herbert, a very accompli&s;hed young Lady, with a fortune of ten thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>A YEAR after their marriage, I was born; and in two years more, they re|ceived a &s;econd addition to their happi|ne&s;s, by the birth of a daughter.&mdash;Nothing material happened during our minority, until I attained my nineteenth
<PB N="55" REF="048426_0028_1025482D268C9760">year. My father paid the greate&s;t at|tention to our education, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t impru|dently lived to the extent of his income.) My mother often remon&s;trated to little purpo&s;e; he was not of a di&s;po&s;ition to brook re&s;traint.</P>
<P>AT that age, I left the univer&s;ity; my father intended me for the army, but my mother would never con&s;ent to it; and was with difficulty prevailed on, to con&s;ent to my making the tour of France and Italy, the en&s;uing year; which I did, accompanied by my friend Beaucamp, and his worthy father; who acted as governor to us both.&mdash;Whil&s;t abroad, I became acquainted with Lord Sidly, &s;on to the Earl of Beauclair.

The coach now &s;topped, and I attended her to the parlour. Lady Beau|clair a&s;ked, "why they came home &s;o &s;oon, and what had become of Lord Sidly." I related what had happened. "I have cau&s;ed a great deal of trouble to Mr. Beverly," &s;aid Lady Maria; "he was &s;o good as to carry me a con&s;iderable di&s;tance in his arms." I could only an|&s;wer her by a look, which I thought &s;he under&s;tood. The day following, the Hon. Charles Sidly &s;et out on his trav|els.

<PB N="59" REF="048426_0030_1024A57E30370868">were equally plea&s;ed with each other; and the next day we went to the rooms. The Ladies prefered walking home; as it was but a very &s;hort di&s;tance, Lord Sidly gave his arm to Caroline, and I offered mine to Lady Maria. We had not proceeded far, when &s;he &s;aid, "you know not how unhappy I have been, Mr. Beverly, &s;ince you left us." She then told me, "that her Papa had en|couraged the addre&s;&s;es of Lord Winter; whom I knew was very di&s;agreeable to her: that he had given her po&s;itive or|ders to prepare to marry him.&mdash;And had it not been for the interce&s;&s;ion of her brother, who had prevailed on him to allow her a little time, &s;he &s;hould e're this have been dragged to the altar." She &s;aid, "&s;he would rather die, than marry that de&s;erted Lord, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he &s;hould be obliged to do when &s;he returned." This was like fire to my brain; though I had no right to hope.

We had now reach|ed the hou&s;e: Lord Sidly in&s;i&s;ted upon our &s;pending the day with them.&mdash;My father waited on him the next day, and invited them to dine; they accepted the invitation. That and many more days we &s;pent together. I was no longer ma&s;ter of my&s;elf: I declared my &s;enti|ments without re&s;erve, and pathetically lamented my hard fortune; I had the plea&s;ure to find &s;he was not di&s;plea&s;ed: but would &s;ay, "O! Beverly, I am &s;ufficiently wretched, do not add to my di&s;tre&s;s, by making me think I am the cau&s;e of unhappine&s;s to you."</P>
<P>THUS we had &s;pent &s;ix weeks, when one evening at an a&s;&s;embly, we were ac|co&s;ted by Lord Winter: he told Lady Maria, "he had ju&s;t arrived from town; and as he did not know where &s;he lodg|ed, he expected to have the plea&s;ure of meeting her there: and very carele&s;sly begged her to go down the next dance with him. She an&s;wered, "&s;he &s;hould dance but little, and was engaged;" "who is the happy per&s;on that u&s;urps

"Very well my Lady, perhaps I may not be al|lowed to wait on you home neither?" &mdash;"Very probable, my Lord," replied &s;he. At that moment, the dance was called&mdash;as I advanced, &s;he aro&s;e and gave me her hand; &s;he trembled &s;o exceed|ingly, &s;he could &s;carcely move. When the dance was over, &s;eeing her very much flurried, I led her to a &s;eat, and called her brother and Caroline to her. I told Lord Sidly, the &s;ight of Lord Winter had affected her &s;o much, &s;he was near fainting.&mdash;"Lord Winter here!" &s;aid he: "Damn him, he'll be the death of the girl yet."</P>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of the evening, Lord Winter had learnt, "I was the only one that had attended Lady Maria &s;ince her arrival at Bath: that &s;he &s;pent the great|e&s;t part of her time at our hou&s;e; in &s;hort, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, I was her favored admirer." He advanced, and addre&s;&s;|ing him&s;elf to her, a&s;ked "if he &s;hould order his chariot."&mdash;She thanked him; but &s;aid, "&s;he &s;hould return with her brother;"&mdash;Lord Sidly gave him a card, and begged the favor of his company &s;o
<PB N="62" REF="048426_0032_1025483AE427FB40">dine the next day: he returned a &s;light bow, and retired to a little di&s;tance, where he could ob&s;erve who went into the carriage.&mdash;I led Lady Maria to the door; when Lord Sidly &s;aid, "Bever|ly I mu&s;t &s;ee you to-morrow morning." &mdash;I went accordingly, and learnt Lady Maria had been &s;o ill all night, &s;he was not able to come down to breakfa&s;t. "I cannot conceive," &s;aid Lord Sidly, "why my father in&s;i&s;ts on &s;acrificing the girl for riches."&mdash;"Oh! my Lord," cried I, "do you know no way to &s;ave her?"&mdash;He &s;aw my emotion, but taking no notice of it, &s;aid, "what can I do for her? can't you advi&s;e me?"&mdash;"I could, but"&mdash;"but what," &s;aid he &s;miling, "I &s;uppo&s;e you would advi&s;e me to get &s;ome clever fellow to take her out of his way."&mdash;"My Lord," &s;aid I, &s;tarting, "be not amazed, would not you like to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in preventing this match?"&mdash;"I would willingly lo&s;e my life, to contribute to her felicity." "But if I'm not mi&s;taken, you mu&s;t pre&s;erve your life, to make her happy." "Hen|ry," continued he, "I will trifle no longer. I have long &s;een the affection

<P>I know not what I &s;aid to him; my extacy may more ea&s;ily be imagined than defined. I would have fell at his feet, and embraced his knees; but pre|venting me, he &s;aid "if I acted like &s;uch a crazy fellow, he would not tru&s;t his &s;i&s;ter with me."&mdash;He then left me, to go to her, with whom he &s;oon returned; and leading her to the &s;ofa, &s;aid, Bever|ly, Maria is quite chagrined at Lord Winter's not calling on her this morn|ing; and I have recommended an hour's conver&s;ation with you, to recover her &s;pirits. So &s;aying, he &s;miled and left us. "Brother!" exclaimed &s;he, with &s;urpri&s;e: I flew to her, and folding her in my arms, told her what had pa&s;&s;ed between Lord Sidly and my&s;elf. We now gave a loo&s;e to the mo&s;t endearing &s;en&s;ations, and for a time forgot the many bars to our union.</P>
<P>WE had been nearly two hours to|gether,
<PB N="64" REF="048426_0033_1025483CC96113C8">when Lord Sidly returned; he &s;eemed thoughtful, and walked the room &s;ometime without &s;peaking; then turn|ing to us, he &s;aid Lord Winter had left Bath; that he had made particular en|quiries concerning me, and was heard to &s;ay, "Lord Beauclair &s;hould be ac|quainted with his children's behaviour." "What is to be done, Beverly?" con|tinued he.&mdash;I told him, "I thought no time was to be lo&s;t; and begged him to let us &s;et out immediately for Scot|land."</P>
<P>IT was accordingly determined, we &s;hould be off at four that afternoon. To prevent &s;u&s;picion, we were to go the fir&s;t &s;tage in Lord Sidly's chariot; he had &s;ent a tru&s;ty &s;ervant on, to provide a po&s;t-chai&s;e. Lord Sidly and my &s;i&s;ter were the only per&s;ons in the &s;ecret; I took all the money I had by me, which amounted to two hundred guineas.&mdash;I left a letter for my father, which I told Caroline not to give him, until the next evening, as we &s;hould by that time be out of reach.</P>
<P>LORD Sidly, at parting, put a bank|note of fifteen hundred pounds in Ma|ria's
<PB N="65" REF="048426_0033_1025483CC96113C8">hand; &s;he was very much affected, and &s;aid, "O, my brother! what will you not &s;uffer on my account." "If you are happy, my dear girl, I &s;hall be amply repaid." About nine miles from Bath, we took a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and Lord Sidly's carriage returned: hone&s;t John had provided relays at every &s;tage, &s;o that we were not obliged to wait a mo|ment. We had travelled all night, but the next day, poor Maria was &s;o fa|tigued, we were obliged to re&s;t &s;ome hours. We arrived without any acci|dent. Maria bore the journey much better than I had expected &s;he would. We were immediately married, and took lodgings, as I thought it be&s;t not to re|turn directly.</P>
<P>THE report of our being eloped, did not &s;pread in Bath, until the afternoon following our departure.&mdash;My father was extremely enraged; his proud &s;pirit could not brook my being de&s;pi&s;ed, as he was certain I &s;hould be by Lord Beau|clair's family; and he made no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> but his lord&s;hip would u&s;e all his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">e&s;t to effect his ruin, (which was indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ca&s;e.)</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="048426_0034_1025483E622220F0">LORD Winter had no &s;ooner arrived in town, than he waited on Lord Beau|clair, and told him, it was currently re|ported, that Lady Maria received the addre&s;&s;es of Mr. Beverly, and Lord Sid|ly encouraged it.

<P>LORD Sidly was extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed on reading his father's letter; he did not think he would have carried his re&s;ent|ment to &s;uch lengths.&mdash;He immediately &s;et out for London. Upon his arrival, he went directly to his father's: when a &s;ervant &s;aid, he had orders to tell him he

She informed him, Lord Beauclair was determined not to &s;ee him: and begged he would never mention her di&s;obedient daughter to her; that Su&s;an &s;hould be ordered to pack up her clothes and jewels, which &s;hould be &s;ent to her; and de&s;ired him to let her know, it was all &s;he had to expect. Poor Su&s;an wept bitterly, and begged &s;he might go to her mi&s;tre&s;s, which &s;he &s;oon after did.</P>
<P>THO' Lord Sidly had only &s;even hun|dred pounds a year independent of his father, he was determined never again to &s;eek his favor; but immediately pur|cha&s;ed a majority in a marching regi|ment, de&s;tined for the Ea&s;t-Indies&mdash;from whence he never returned.</P>
<P>HERE Mr. Villars &s;topped, from an incapability of proceeding.&mdash;He after &s;ome time thus continued: "Some weeks after our marriage, Su&s;an arrived with my wife's trunks, and a letter from
<PB N="68" REF="048426_0035_1025484491E14D10">Lord Sidly; he mentioned his going to India, but &s;aid he would pay us a vi&s;it before he &s;ailed.&mdash;Maria and I had both wrote to Lord Beauclair; and our let|ters had been returned unopened; &s;he could bear with greater fortitude, their cruelty to her&s;elf, than to her brother; it mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected us, that he &s;hould &s;uffer &s;o much for us; he &s;pent a fortnight with us before he &s;ailed, and &s;eemed perfectly chearful.&mdash;He told my wife to be entirely ea&s;y, on his account, that leaving her happy, would be a great means of making him &s;o. Soon after he left us, we received a letter from him, in which he impowered me to draw upon his banker for two hundred a year, until his return.</P>
<P>MY wife di&s;po&s;ed of her jewels; the &s;ale of which amounted to fourteen hun|dred pounds; this we added to the pre|&s;ent Lord Sidly had &s;o generou&s;ly made his &s;i&s;ter, and purcha&s;ed a &s;mall e&s;tate in my father's neighborhood. But, alas! a cloud was now hanging over our heads, which bur&s;t with all its force.</P>
<P>MY father had been obliged to mort|gage his e&s;tate for &s;everal hundreds.
<PB N="69" REF="048426_0035_1025484491E14D10">Lord Beauclair bought the mortgage, and immediately clo&s;ed it; this height|ened my father's re&s;entment again&s;t me; he had never been perfectly reconciled; he &s;aid, he was convinced I &s;hould be his ruin.&mdash;My wife propo&s;ed mortga|ging our e&s;tate, to clear his, but he would not accept of it. His was accord|ingly &s;old for much le&s;s than the value. &mdash;My &s;i&s;ter was ju&s;t married to Colonel Montgomery, and went with him to Scotland. Had my father been pru|dent, he &s;till had &s;ufficient to live com|fortably; but his &s;pirit was too great to retrench.</P>
<P>AFTER his affairs were &s;ettled, there were &s;even thou&s;and pounds remaining, which he placed in the hands of an emi|nent broker: took a hou&s;e in Bath; and lived as u&s;ual.&mdash;A year after our marriage, my Maria pre&s;ented me with a &s;on, whom we named Henry, after Lord Sidly.</P>
<P>HERE Mr. Villars cea&s;ed&mdash;the tears flowed &s;o fa&s;t, he was obliged to leave the room; in a &s;hort time he returned, and thus continued: "When my &s;on was about &s;ix months old; Lord and

"It is a &s;weet boy," &s;aid &s;he. She then took a gold medal, and tied it by a ribbon round the child's neck: the nur&s;e a&s;ked if &s;he &s;hould tell Mrs. Beverly to whom &s;he was obliged. She an&s;wered, "it was not material."&mdash;When the nur&s;e came home, &s;he acquainted my wife with the ren|counter.&mdash;My poor Maria was near faint|ing; &s;he knew the medal, and found her mother was &s;till determined not to &s;ee her.&mdash;She, however, re&s;olved again to write, but they left Bath the next day.</P>
<P>MY father's affairs now became de&s;|perate&mdash;his creditors pre&s;&s;ed upon him, and we determined to mortgage our e&s;|tate, and &s;end him relief as from an un|known hand. We rai&s;ed eight hundred

His debts were to a much greater amount than we were worth, and I &s;aw him dragged to the pri&s;on without the power to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>I applied to &s;everal of his friends in town, but Lord Beauclair had prejudi|ced them again&s;t him. He &s;uffered but a few months&mdash;he was &s;eized with a fever that carried him off within a few weeks.</P>
<P>HOW can I expre&s;s my feelings?&mdash;I looked upon my&s;elf as acce&s;&s;ary to his misfortune. The creditors took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of every thing: my poor mother &s;uffered in &s;ilence, and never reproached me; &s;he &s;oon went to Scotland to my &s;i&s;ter, as Col. Montgomery had pre&s;&s;ed her to &s;pend the remainder of her days with them. She was &s;carcely gone, when Mr. Granville, the gentleman from whom we borrowed the money demand|ed immediate payment. Lord Beau|clair would not appear in this; but I have been &s;ince informed, he per&s;uaded Mr. Granville to act in the manner he did.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="048426_0037_1025484D10BB91C0">I WAS now obliged to apply to a broker, and to give an exhorbitant in|tere&s;t. It is needle&s;s to mention the many misfortunes that attended me in the cour&s;e of two years; I was obliged to &s;ell my e&s;tate. I had now one thou|&s;and pounds left; with which I &s;till continued in trade, with a merchant in Bri&s;tol. Our whole &s;tock was now em|barked in one bottom, and the fate of that was uncertain; troubles &s;eemed to thicken upon us; anxiety for my fami|ly (for I had now two children) entirely depre&s;&s;ed my &s;pirits: but fortune had &s;till greater evils in &s;tore; we had been but three years married, when we receiv|ed accounts of Lord Sidly's death: this &s;troke was almo&s;t too much for my poor Maria; but heaven &s;upported her through it.

<P>I LEFT Lord Sidly's will with Mr. Traffic, and a power (if it could be pro|ved,) to &s;ue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the e&s;tate. I made no
<PB N="78" REF="048426_0040_1025485807DE7338">doubt, but Lord Beauclair's hatred would &s;till follow me; &s;o thought it expedi|ent to change my name to Villars, which indeed was my real one; but as I never had received any of the e&s;tate of Bever|ly, I was not obliged to keep the name. Our whole fortune, after providing for our &s;ea &s;tores, amounted to no more than twelve hundred pounds. We took no &s;ervant with us, but Mrs. Worthy, the nur&s;e, and a girl that attended Lou|i&s;a, who was eleven months old.</P>
<P>THE fourth of June, 1766, we &s;ailed. The weather was exceeding fine, and continued &s;o, till the next afternoon, when a gu&s;t &s;uddenly came up. The ve&s;&s;el rolled exce&s;&s;ively, and my wife and poor little Henry were very &s;ick. Mrs. Worthy took him for the benefit of the air, on deck, but unu&s;ed to the motion of a &s;hip, her head turned; &s;he reeled, and fell overboard&mdash;and I never &s;aw them more."&mdash;Here Mr. Villars was for &s;ome time incapable of proceeding. "It is needle&s;s" continued he, after it had recovered him&s;elf, "to de&s;cribe our di&s;tre&s;s on this occa&s;ion: the ve&s;&s;el im|mediately brought too, but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>MY wife continued in fits for many hours; after they left her, &s;he remained in a violent fever, and in her delirium was continually calling for her child; and it was many days e'er &s;he became more tranquil.&mdash;I now &s;aw it was the will of the Almighty to cha&s;ti&s;e us, and prayed fervently for fortitude, to &s;upport the trial I was in all probability to go through. Our attention was now rou|&s;ed by the illne&s;s of our little Loui&s;a; who had been obliged to be weaned, during her mother's illne&s;s; &s;he was for many days &s;o bad, that we did not ex|pect &s;he would have got to Madeira alive. After a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age we reached that I&s;land; I had letters to many of the principal Merchants there, which not long after our arrival I delivered; and received the greate&s;t politene&s;s from them.</P>
<P>MY wife and child's ill health, deter|mined me to &s;tay in Madeira&punc; I wrote to Mr. Traffic, and informed him of my
<PB N="80" REF="048426_0041_10254859CC698550">lo&s;s, and my intention of remaining at the i&s;land, which I de&s;ired him to keep &s;ecret, as well as my changing my name. I al&s;o inclo&s;ed letters to my mother and &s;i&s;ter, whom I had not heard from in &s;ome time; I placed my &s;mall &s;tock in a principal hou&s;e, and was enabled to live tolerably well.</P>
<P>NOTHING material happened, during our re&s;idence in Madeira; except my wife pre&s;enting me with another &s;on, whom we called Edward, after my fa|ther.&mdash;The climate not agreeing with either of us; we embarked for Ameri|ca. We were now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of about two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. "To you &s;ir," addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mr. Sommers, "I was recommended, and have received the greate&s;t marks of friend&s;hip from many gentlemen in this town.&mdash;I have lived &s;everal years com|fortably; and had it not been for the recollection of pa&s;t misfortunes, I might &s;ay happily.&mdash;Here my younge&s;t &s;on was born, who after the Hon.

<P>Mr. VILLARS here ended his &s;tory; and the company expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t obligations to him for his conde&s;cen&s;ion. Mr. Hargrave, who could contain him|&s;elf no longer, and who had di&s;covered vi&s;ible marks of unea&s;ine&s;s, now ap|proached Mr. Villars, and told him "he was extremely happy to find the family, whom mo&s;t on earth he wi&s;hed to &s;ee; and &s;hould ever think the accident that drew him to his hou&s;e, the peculiar work of Providence."</P>
<P>Mr. VILLARS &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed, and begged him to explain him&s;elf.

It was very late before Mi&s;s Sommers fini&s;hed her letter, which &s;he di&s;patched early next morning.</P>
<P>AT two o'clock, Captain Bellmore and Mr. Hargrave attended the Ladies to Col. Rightly's, as Mr. Sommers had bu&s;ine&s;s that would engage him till late.

Soon after dinner Mr. Hargrave went out of the room, and &s;tayed &s;ome time. Mrs. Sommers, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Colonel Rightly, &s;aid, "I dare &s;ay our young friend has gone to pay a vi&s;it to his old nur&s;e:" "No doubt of it madam," re|plied he. He then informed Mr. Vil|lars of the many particulars relating to Mrs. Carely; "come," continued he, "we will pa&s;s her room, as if by chance, and you will be more than ever delight|ed with Hargrave. I think he never appears in a more amiable light, than when he is &s;aying obliging things to this poor woman." Mr. Villars then fol|lowed him. The room door was open; they entered.&mdash;"Harry," &s;aid Colonel Rightly, "I am going to a&s;k Mr. Vil|lars's opinion of &s;ome curio&s;ities in my greenhou&s;e; will you be of the party?" Mrs. Carely ro&s;e as they entered, on &s;ee|ing Mr. Villars, &s;he &s;tarted, and &s;eemed very much a&s;toni&s;hed; Mr. Villars <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> equally &s;truck.

<P>Mrs. CARLEY was now &s;ufficiently recovered, to tell Mr. Villars they were taken up by a fi&s;herman; that after much trouble and difficulty, &s;he had conveyed the child to his Grand-Mama, where he was brought up in ignorance of his birth.&mdash;When her &s;pirits were more compo&s;ed, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he would give him all the particulars.</P>

<P>COL. Rightly now informed the La|dies tea was waiting.

<P>"YOU no doubt &s;ir, remember ma&s;ter Harry was very &s;ick, and I carried him on deck for the benefit of the air; it was carele&s;s in me to walk &s;o near the &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el.

I was too weak to walk, and one of the men &s;upported me, while the other carried the child; they carried me to a neat little hou&s;e near the banks of the river, and the women &s;upplied us with dry clothes; the dear child &s;eemed almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to every thing till the next day, he then cried very much for his Mama.

<P>I WORKED a year in Ireland, to get my&s;elf and the child a few clothes; but this I could not have accompli&s;hed, had it not been for the humanity of the lady with whom I lived.

<P>THE poor dear child had forgot to call on his papa and mama; and I would not remind him of them, as I thought it be&s;t in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> call him my own. When we arrived in Port&s;mouth, I had but two guineas left; I intended going to Bri&s;tol, to Mr. Traffic, from whom I was in hopes to hear of you and my Lady. I &s;et out in a waggon.

That for &s;ome time after your departure, Lord Beau|clair &s;eemed thoughtful; and would &s;ometimes mention Lady Maria, which he had before forbid any per&s;on to do in his pre&s;ence.

Mr. Sommers had for &s;ome time &s;een an attachment between his young friend and daughter, and would never have been aver&s;e to the match; but now to hear him &s;peak in this manner, was quite beyond his mo&s;t &s;anguine expect|ation. "My Lord," &s;aid he, "I hope Eliza is &s;en&s;ible of the honour you do her, nothing can give me more plea&s;ure than &s;uch a connection; though your fortune is more than &s;he has a right to expect; believe me, I e&s;teem your vir|tues much higher, and &s;hould have been happy, had you put it in my pow|er to have convinced you, that my con|&s;ent would have as freely been given to Mr. Hargrave as to Lord Beauclair." "Oh! Sir," returned his Lord&s;hip, "you have long &s;ince convinced me of

<P>DURING the above conver&s;ation, Mi&s;s Sommers retired to the window, to avoid confu&s;ion; he went to her, and pre&s;&s;ing her to his bo&s;om, &s;aid, "my dear Eliza, you &s;ay nothing." "You cannot, my Lord," returned &s;he, "think me in&s;en&s;ible of the honor your Lord&s;hip does me." "This &s;till from <HI>you,</HI> my Eliza&mdash;I am &s;till your Henry, &s;peak to me as you u&s;ed to do, and I am happy." "If any thing I can &s;ay or do will make you happy, believe me, you will never be otherwi&s;e.

So &s;aying, they left the room.</P>
<P>LORD Beauclair told her, there was an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for his going im|mediately to England: and earne&s;tly begged to have the ceremony performed
<PB N="118" REF="048426_0060_102548A16A37ADA0">before he went. &mdash; The thought of part|ing, drew tears from Eliza. She con|&s;ented, to his wi&s;hes; and it was con|cluded, the marriage &s;hould take place as &s;oon as Mr. Villars's family could come to town.</P>
<P>IT was late when they parted; Lord Beauclair, retired to write to Lady Beauclair, as an opportunity offered for England. He wrote to her in the mo&s;t affectionate manner, giving her a full ac|count of his meeting with his parents, his engagements with Mi&s;s Sommers, and his intention of &s;oon returning; he &s;aid nothing of a de&s;ign he had of per|&s;uading his father and his family to re|turn with him to England, le&s;t he &s;hould fail.&mdash;He &s;pent the next day with his Eliza, and the following &s;et out for&mdash;, where he &s;oon arrived.</P>
<P>MRS. Villars bore the death of her father, with greater re&s;ignation than her &s;on expected; his having mentioned her with kindne&s;s in his la&s;t moments. &s;eemed a great con&s;olation. "He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> forgiven me!" exclaimed &s;he, cla&s;ping her hands, "he no doubt, ble&s;&s;ed me
<PB N="119" REF="048426_0060_102548A16A37ADA0">with his dying breath! and I am happy; my mother too! could I once more throw my&s;elf at her feet."</P>
<P>"YOU &s;hall, my deare&s;t madam," an&s;wered Lord Beauclair; it is my earne&s;t de&s;ire that we will return to Eng|land."&mdash;"What," &s;aid Mr. Villars, "go to a place where I have never ex|perienced any thing but trouble."&mdash;"Every comfort awaits you now, my dear Sir;&mdash;If the fifteen thou&s;and pounds my Grandfather has left my Mother, is in&s;ufficient, as much of my fortune as you wi&s;h to make u&s;e of, is entirely at your &s;ervice."</P>
<P>AH! my Henry, &s;uch a Son as you are, can be refu&s;ed nothing. Fifteen thou&s;and pounds is much more than we want for your Mother; and I will never alter our manner of living. If we go with you to England, we mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on living retired." In this he was joined by Mrs. Villars.</P>
<P>THEIR amiable &s;on took a hand of each. "You &s;hall live as you plea&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> dear Parents," &s;aid he, "only let me have the happine&s;s of having you near me." He then informed them of
