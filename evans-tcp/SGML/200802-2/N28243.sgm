<Q><BIBL><HI>2 SAMUEL, iii. 38.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And the king &s;aid unto his &s;ervants, Know ye not that there is a prince, and a great man, fallen this day in I&s;rael?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE man, the great man, to whom the king of Judah refers in this pa&s;&s;age, was Gene|ral Abner, commander in chief of the armies, <HI>the thou&s;ands of I&s;rael.</HI> He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great po|litical and military abilities. The&s;e he di&s;played in the cabinet, and in the cour&s;e of that bloody war which continued long <HI>between the hou&s;e of Saul and the hou&s;e of David.</HI></P>
<P>Attached to his country by warm affection, he voluntarily &s;tept forth in the defence of its rights, its liberties, civil and religious; and fought the battles of the Lord of Ho&s;ts&punc;</P>
<P>He was highly e&s;teemed by his countrymen. His name gave plea&s;ure to all ranks, and to all
<PB N="6" REF="037646_0004_100F2C6EE7D9C840">
ages, of citizens; and in Abner, the great Abner, they placed the mo&s;t unre&s;erved confidence.</P>
<P>He was now grown old in the &s;ervice of his country; and the time of his departure drew near. Like all other great men, the general mu&s;t die! His exit was attended with circum&s;tances peculiarly affecting. This &s;olemn event took place when his friends were promi&s;ing them&s;elves great advantages from his wi&s;dom, patrioti&s;m, fidelity, and per&s;everance. They were then hop|ing for the renewal of a union between them and a nation with whom they were now at war. Yea, a treaty was, at that very time, actually on foot for the de&s;irable purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This great man was interred with peculiar marks of re&s;pect. We are informed, in the &s;acred page, that <HI>king David him&s;elf followed the bier.</HI> His memory was embalmed with military honours. The &s;cene drew tears from the va&s;t multitude that attended upon the affecting occa&s;ion; who com|po&s;ed the funeral proce&s;&s;ion. <HI>And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lift up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037646_0005_100F2C711E0A3750">The text then may be con&s;idered as an eulogy delivered at the tomb of this great man. It contains the effu&s;ions of a heart deeply affected with the &s;ubject, and appears to be &s;poken with all the energy of oriental eloquence. The orator was the &s;weet P&s;almi&s;t of I&s;rael. <HI>And the king la|mented over Abner; and all the people wept again over him.</HI></P>
<P>And to impre&s;s the minds of the ri&s;en, and e&s;pecially the ri&s;ing generation, with a &s;en&s;e of the obligations they were under to this great man, orders were i&s;&s;ued by authority, that proper badges of mourning &s;hould be worn by the citizens in honour to the renowned and illu&s;trious general. <HI>And David &s;aid to Joab, and to all the people, Rend your clothes, and gird you with &s;ackcloth, and mourn before Abner.</HI></P>
<P>The people, no doubt, were the more deeply affected by this event, the fall of this pillar of the &s;tate, as the times were <HI>troublous.</HI> There was not that harmony in &s;entiment, with re&s;pect to the public mea&s;ures, which every friend to &s;ociety mo&s;t devoutly wi&s;hed; and war, though at a di&s;|tance, raged with relentle&s;s fury.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="037646_0006_100F2C7354683E40">What tidings were the&s;e to the great national council! to the army! to the citizens! and to every benevolent friend of mankind! <HI>Abner is fallen!</HI> fallen from his &s;phere of honour, dignity, and u&s;efulne&s;s! fallen by the all-conquering arm of the great de&s;troyer of man! How much wi&s;|dom, what military glory, are con&s;igned to the narrow limits of his venerable tomb! This brave man is fallen into the &s;ilent grave! <HI>There, princes, coun&s;ellors, and the pri&s;oners, re&s;t together. The &s;mall and the great are there, and the &s;ervant is free from his ma&s;ter. They lie down alike in the du&s;t, and the worms &s;hall cover them.</HI></P>
<P>What a gloom was now &s;pread over the mourn|ing nation! Yea, a neighbouring prince, contem|plating the irreparable lo&s;s &s;ociety &s;u&s;tained in the death of this great man, ob&s;erves, <HI>I am this day weak, though anointed king.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, in the cour&s;e of Divine Providence, a pro&s;|perous and flouri&s;hing family, an agreeable circle of acquaintance, an opulent and increa&s;ing town, a whole nation, by the death of an important in|dividual, may indulge a momentary de&s;pondency, and &s;ay, <HI>Clouds and darkne&s;s are round about him.
<PB N="9" REF="037646_0007_100F2C75711F4970">
Thy judgments are a great deep. Thy way is in the &s;ea, thy paths in the great waters, and thy foot&s;teps are not known.</HI> But to the pious, who ever tru&s;t in God, light, like the morning &s;un, ari&s;es from the con&s;oling con&s;ideration, that <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</HI> The&s;e, when darkne&s;s &s;preads over the political horizon; when tho&s;e great and good men, who by their wi&s;|dom and influence <HI>&s;eemed to be pillars</HI> in church and &s;tate, are removed by death; yea, the&s;e, with un&s;haken confidence in Jehovah, <HI>are glad, and re|joice, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.</HI></P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age, my brethren, contains &s;entiments which harmonize with the pre&s;ent feelings of the United States, with a variation, the propriety of which all mu&s;t acknowledge to be ju&s;t: Know ye not, my friends, that General WASHING|TON, one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of men, is fal|len in America!</P>
<P>Who can refrain, upon this mournful and &s;o|lemn occa&s;ion, from exclaiming, O Death! what a victim do&s;t thou now embrace in thy cold arms! Thou art indeed the king of terrors.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="10" REF="037646_0008_100F2C782D81F6A0">I. WASHINGTON was great.</P>
<P>His Maker endowed him with di&s;tingui&s;hed mental faculties, and formed him for great and no|ble actions. His mind was &s;olid, contemplative, &s;edate, vigorous, tenacious, and determined. His acquirements were &s;uch as rendered him agreeable, in&s;tructive, and eminently u&s;eful, to his connex|ions and to mankind. His genius was prolific: its productions were &s;uch as di&s;played depth of thought, &s;oundne&s;s of judgment, peculiar penetration, and unconquerable energy. But what gave a lu&s;tre to his great abilities, his a&s;&s;emblage of virtues, and to all his heroic achievements, was, the uprightne&s;s, the benevolence, of his heart. What a di&s;intere&s;ted regard for the welfare of his country animated him, in his various exertions, while he was engaged in the mo&s;t hazardous enterpri&s;es!</P>
<P>He had an uncommon knowledge of men, of nations, and of the art of war. Of this no one can doubt, who will read the hi&s;tory of the Ame|rican war. Through our long conte&s;t with Britain, this Great Man, in the mo&s;t trying cir|cum&s;tances, di&s;played the wi&s;dom, the courage, the united qualifications, which rendered him emi|nent
<PB N="11" REF="037646_0009_100F2C7B189716F8">
in his important &s;tation, prepared him to con|tend victoriou&s;ly with the mo&s;t renowned European generals, and, under the protection and influ|ence of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, and God of Armies, to become the &s;aviour of his country.</P>
<P>Thus when fleets and armies arrived upon our coa&s;t, and had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town of Bo&s;|ton, with a view of depriving us of tho&s;e privileges which our venerable predece&s;&s;ors &s;o highly valued; when we found our&s;elves under the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity to have recour&s;e to the &s;word; to rai&s;e an army of American youth to defend the liberties, and to &s;ecure the civil and religious rights, of their native land; at this period of memorable impor|tance, the Great and Benevolent Governor of the Univer&s;e had, in his wi&s;e and merciful providence, provided a WASHINGTON to take the com|mand of our newly-rai&s;ed army.</P>
<P>Before this Great Man whole armies fell, laid down their arms, and owned him Conqueror. Proud Britain was defeated in her cruel attempt to &s;ubdue the Americans; and, "after expending nearly one hundred millions of money, and lo&s;ing an hundred thou&s;and lives, was reduced to the hu|miliating
<PB N="12" REF="037646_0010_100F2C7D557D7ED0">
nece&s;&s;ity of acknowledging the indepen|dence of the United States."</P>
<P>In this Great Man were united patience, pru|dence, probity, &s;incerity, veracity, firmne&s;s, calm|ne&s;s, and unconquerable per&s;everance.</P>
<P>Actuated by that benevolence which influenced him to &s;erve his country almo&s;t eight years as Ge|neral of the American Army, he refu&s;ed every pe|cuniary compen&s;ation for his ine&s;timable &s;ervices.</P>
<P>But the greatne&s;s of this excellent man was not only exhibited in his military character; his Poli|tical Abilities &s;hone with un&s;ullied lu&s;tre. He was great in the cabinet. Even Congre&s;s it&s;elf, that venerable and highly-e&s;teemed body of wi&s;e &s;tate&s;|men, were indebted to WASHINGTON for that information which originated tho&s;e re&s;olves, the wi&s;dom of which has a&s;toni&s;hed the world.</P>
<P>We, my brethren, feel, to this day, the happy effects of his influence in that National Conven|tion, by whom the plan of our Federal Govern|ment was formed, in which WASHINGTON, with his u&s;ual dignity, pre&s;ided.</P>
<P>Called by the unanimous voice of the millions of America, he took the fir&s;t &s;eat in our new go|vernment;
<PB N="13" REF="037646_0011_100F2C7FCDEF13E0">
and we, with gratitude to Heaven, beheld GEORGE WASHINGTON Pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>
<P>Here a wide field was opened; here was &s;cope for the di&s;play of the abilities of this great and il|lu&s;trious Patriot.</P>
<P>All were plea&s;ed; all rejoiced; for all approved of, and put confidence in, his wi&s;e and &s;ucce&s;sful admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>How &s;afe felt all ranks and denominations of citi|zens! and what pro&s;perity was extended over our quiet country! The friends of mankind, upon both &s;ides of the terraqueous globe, rejoiced that Ame|rica was favoured with &s;uch a Great and Good Man; &s;o eminently qualified, and &s;o benevolently di&s;po&s;ed, to guide their public affairs, and to give energy to their government. Yea, gentlemen of di&s;tingui&s;hed ob&s;ervation and philanthropy, who came from the Old to vi&s;it the New World, like Sheba's queen beholding <HI>Solomon in all his glory,</HI> have, with no le&s;s admiration, when acquainted with this Great Man, exclaimed, <HI>It was a true re|port that we heard in our own land of thy acts, and of thy wi&s;dom. Howbeit, we believed not the words until
<PB N="14" REF="037646_0012_100F2C82048FCD08">
we came, and our eyes had &s;een it. And, behold, the half was not told us. Thy wi&s;dom and pro&s;perity exceed the fame which we heard. Happy are thy men. Hap|py are the&s;e thy &s;ervants, who &s;tand continually before thee, and that hear thy wi&s;dom!</HI></P>
<P>As an evidence of the greatne&s;s of this Man, in the e&s;timate of the mo&s;t enlightened and judicious of mankind, the celebrated heroes, politicians, &s;tate&s;men, and benevolent, of all nations, have con&s;idered it as their brighte&s;t ornament to be cla&s;&s;ed with General WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>The friends of religion, who intere&s;t them&s;elves in the welfare of &s;ociety, have not been the inattentive &s;pectators of the&s;e momentous events, the&s;e amazing revolutions, which have been rolling on; and with which they have felt them&s;elves, and the cau&s;e they are engaged in, mo&s;t intimately connected. They have been concerned <HI>for the ark.</HI> Their clo&s;ets can witne&s;s the &s;incerity and fervency of their prayers to their God for their dear country. When therefore they &s;aw this Great Man placed at the head of our government, they con|&s;idered it as an evidence that God had not for&s;aken this, though they were a very ungrateful and wick|ed
<PB N="15" REF="037646_0013_100F2C843689AF68">
people; but that he had ble&s;&s;ings in &s;tore for the pre&s;ent and future generations. They per&s;o|nally and unitedly rejoiced that God had rai&s;ed up this Great Man to be an in&s;trument of &s;o much good to them and to their brethren.</P>
<P>It was in an eminent &s;en&s;e &s;upporting to the humble followers of the Lamb of God, of which they had the mo&s;t plenary evidence, that WASH|INGTON was not &s;eeking per&s;onal fame, worldly emolument, popular aggrandizement, and unlimit|ed power; but through all his military exertions, and his political labours, he was aiming to promote the peace, happine&s;s and be&s;t intere&s;t of his country. This a&s;&s;imilated him to the ancient Mordecai, who was <HI>accepted of the multitude of his brethren; &s;eeking the wealth of his people, and &s;peaking peace to all his &s;eed.</HI></P>
<P>WASHINGTON di&s;covered true greatne&s;s by his attention to, and uniform regard for, religion. He believed that there was a God who governed the univer&s;e; <HI>that he doth according to his will in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; that none can &s;tay his hand, or &s;ay unto him, What do&s;t thou? Therefore he prai&s;ed, extolled
<PB N="16" REF="037646_0014_100F2C86648BB298">
and honoured the God of heaven; all who&s;e works are truth, and his ways judgment; and tho&s;e who walk in pride, he is able to aba&s;e. He knew that there is no king &s;aved by the multitude of an ho&s;t; a mighty man is not delivered by much &s;trength.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;aw the hand of God in tho&s;e remarkable providences which took place under his in&s;pection, and were the effects of his exertions; that con|catenation of events, which preceded, opened the way to, and terminated it, the independence of America. In the hour of victory therefore, he called upon all the brigade of his army to give thanks to the Almighty for his merciful interpo&s;i|tion in favour of his conquering troops.</P>
<P>Thus, at the &s;urrender of lord Cornwallis, the Commander in Chief of the American army re|commended to the officers and &s;oldiers to attend upon divine &s;ervice with a &s;erious deportment, and with that &s;en&s;ibility of heart, which the recol|lection of the &s;urpri&s;ing and particular interpo&s;i|tion of Providence, in their favour, claimed."</P>
<P>Recollect, my brethren, his an&s;wers to the nu|merous and flattering addre&s;&s;es of his fellow
<PB N="17" REF="037646_0015_100F2C888A1B95E0">
citizens; in which he kept his eye upon the government of Jehovah; took nothing to him&s;elf, but gave all the glory to God.</P>
<P>Wa&s;hington profe&s;&s;ed a veneration for the GREAT REDEEMER; was one of his vi&s;ible followers; united him&s;elf to his di&s;ciples; &s;at at his table; and commemorated that &s;olemn, that mo&s;t intere&s;ting event, which opened the way for the &s;alvation of &s;inners.</P>
<P>It was one of the maxims of this Great Man, that religion is the only durable foundation of republican governments. If a people are pro&s;per|ous and happy, they mu&s;t acknowledge God in all their ways, ob&s;erve his precepts, and obey his commandments.</P>
<P>He knew that they, and they only, are truly great, who con&s;ult, and exert them&s;elves to pro|mote, the be&s;t good, the real happine&s;s, of man|kind.</P>
<P>His conduct upon the &s;tage of public life was a &s;triking declaration, that vice is no part of, but is incompatible with, real greatne&s;s; that a man may &s;u&s;tain the highe&s;t offices, move in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous &s;phere, be &s;urrounded with the mo&s;t
<PB N="18" REF="037646_0016_100F2C8B713C1870">
flattering temptations, and yet not deviate from, nor violate, the laws of his God.</P>
<P>In the hi&s;tory of this Great Man we behold the mo&s;t immaculate character that was ever drawn by the pen of an unin&s;pired hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>Here, my brethren, is an example replete with wi&s;dom and virtue, worth the attention and imi|tation of politicians, magi&s;trates, citizens, and per&s;ons of all ranks and ages; an example which not only excites the admiration of the pre&s;ent age, but will gain the veneration and applau&s;e of future generations.</P>
<P>The greatne&s;s of WASHINGTON was not eclip&s;ed by his retirement from public life. The very idea of his being alive, an inhabitant of MOUNT VERNON, had a greater tendency to pre|&s;erve the union of the States, and to repel foreign inva&s;ion, than an army of twenty thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>And when our national affairs wore an alarm|ing a&s;pect, we &s;ee him, at the call of his country, "cheerfully relinqui&s;h the &s;weets of retirement, and once more take the command of the armies of the United States."</P>
<P>But, while moving in this &s;phere of nation|al importance; forming the nece&s;&s;ary arrange|ments&mdash;death
<PB N="19" REF="037646_0017_100F2C8E32188620">
put an end to all his plans; da&s;hed the high-rai&s;ed expectations of Americans, and filled the world with mourners.</P>
<P N="2">II. WASHINGTON is fallen.</P>
<P>This Great Man was mortal. It is the decree, the irrever&s;ible decree, of Jehovah, that man mu&s;t die. <HI>I &s;aid, Ye are gods, but ye &s;hall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</HI> With propriety may we adopt the affecting lamentation of David over his beloved Jonathan, who fell upon mount Gilboa; <HI>How is the mighty fallen!</HI></P>
<P>By the decrea&s;e of this great man, this benefactor, this highly-e&s;teemed, heroic general, this patrio|tic &s;tate&s;man, the United States &s;u&s;tain a lo&s;s, an irreparable lo&s;s. His &s;udden, unexpected exit has deprived his AMIABLE CONSORT, his dear con|nexions, his weeping friends, of this ornament to his country, this ju&s;tly-admired, virtuous, great, and mo&s;t amiable man.</P>
<P>The departure of &s;uch a man, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of our public affairs, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as no common calamity to our nation, and even to the world.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="037646_0018_100F2C8FC304B868">But the &s;cene is clo&s;ed! We mu&s;t &s;ee his face no more! His voice, which charmed thou&s;ands, is &s;ucceeded by a &s;olemn, awful &s;ilence. His pen, that taught le&s;&s;ons mo&s;t important to &s;ociety, has dropped from that hand, which, guided by an enlightened mind, a virtuous heart, has charmed the world by its productions.</P>
<P>The Wi&s;e and Holy Governor of the Univer&s;e hath in the cour&s;e of his providence, which is ever ju&s;t and righteous, removed from this re|gion of calamity the Father of his Country. Yes, there lies WASHINGTON, upon a level now with a continental &s;oldier! Both &s;leep quietly together, in the &s;ame grave; the hou&s;e appointed for all the living.</P>
<P>It is true, &s;o long as the human mind is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power of recollection, the character, the example, of this great man mu&s;t be immortal.</P>
<P N="3">III. It is rea&s;onable that we &s;hould take pub|lic notice of this alarming event.</P>
<P>When Abner died, the king, the court, the army, the citizens, a&s;&s;embled; and, as a te&s;timo|nial of their re&s;pect, dropt a tear over the fallen general.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="037646_0019_100F2C9152409798">Much honour mo&s;t certainly is due to the memory of tho&s;e great men who have rendered e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to their country.</P>
<P>How immen&s;e is our debt of gratitude to God, who rai&s;ed up this Great Man, and qualified him for his di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;tation!</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion &s;orrow hath filled our hearts. Americans put on &s;ackcloth; they wear badges expre&s;&s;ive of the general lamentation. We are all mourners this day.</P>
<P>That venerable &s;age, the renowned ADAMS, Pre&s;ident of the United States, mu&s;t &s;en&s;ibly feel, and unite with Congre&s;s in deploring, the de|parture of this Great Man.</P>
<P>The army contemplate the death of their Gene|ral with the keene&s;t &s;en&s;ibility; and expre&s;s their undi&s;gui&s;ed grief in the animated &s;tyle of an an|cient military corps: WASHINGTON was <HI>worth ten thou&s;and of us.</HI></P>
<P>The Children of God, the Di&s;ciples of Je&s;us, are the mo&s;t &s;incere mourners in this day of darkne&s;s. They, it is true, are reconciled to all the divine admini&s;trations. But when men of di&s;tingui&s;hed worth, and of eminent u&s;efulne&s;s, are &s;uddenly re|moved
<PB N="22" REF="037646_0020_100F2C94365ADF08">
by death, they con&s;ider it as a token of the di&s;plea&s;ure of God; a judgment of Heaven upon an u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ateful, wicked people.</P>
<P>The face of every citizen, who is a friend to his country, gathers palene&s;s, and neighbour addre&s;&s;es neighbour in the language of the text: Know ye not that WASHINGTON, that great and good man, is fallen in our I&s;rael!</P>
<P>But why do events like the&s;e take place in the wi&s;e and perfect government of the the Mo&s;t High God?</P>
<P N="1">1. This event is calculated to impre&s;s the mind of man with a &s;en&s;e of univer&s;al mortality.</P>
<P>Here we have the irre&s;i&s;tible evidence, that the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities, con&s;picuous virtues, wealth, honour, popularity, exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s, all that the world e&s;teem great and valuable, can|not &s;ecure the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or from &s;epulchral darkne&s;s, the gloomy man&s;ion of the grave.</P>
<P><HI>As for man, his days are as gra&s;s; as the flower of the field &s;o he flouri&s;heth. The wind pa&s;&s;eth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof &s;hall know it no more&punc; His days are determined; the number of his

months are with thee; thou ha&s;t appointed his bounds, that he cannot pa&s;s. Man lieth down, and ri&s;eth not till the heavens be no more.</HI></P>
<P>How loud the pre&s;ent call! how alarming the admonition!</P>
<P>It is &s;aid of the king of Macedon, that he or|dered his &s;ervant, though he might be &s;urrounded by his nobles, his generals, all the pomp and pa|geantry of his court, every morning to enter his apartment, and to whi&s;per in his ear, PHILIP, THOU ART MORTAL.</P>
<P>May rulers and ruled hear the voice of God in this &s;peaking providence: <HI>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</HI></P>
<P>And may we, my brethren, daily repeat the pe|tition of ancient piety, <HI>Lord, make us to know our end, and the mea&s;ure of our days, what it is, that we may know how frail we are.</HI> In the view of our approaching di&s;&s;olution, may we realize the va&s;t importance of <HI>repentance towards God, and of faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that when he who is the believer's life &s;hall appear, we may appear with him in glory. Therefore be ye al&s;o ready, for at &s;uch an hour as ye think not the Son of Man cometh.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="24" REF="037646_0022_100F2C98DCE5C420">2. By the death of General WASHINGTON we are taught not to put too much dependence upon any of our fellow creatures, however great and u&s;eful.</P>
<P>Is it not an evidence of the depravity of human nature, that rational beings forget that the <HI>wi&s;e man dieth?</HI> that the mo&s;t important members in the community <HI>dwell in hou&s;es of clay, who&s;e foun|dation is in the du&s;t, which are cru&s;hed before the moth?</HI></P>
<P>I recollect, in the cour&s;e of the American revo|lution, an ob&s;ervation of a young continental offi|cer, who had, not many days before, left the camp. He was, with peculiar plea&s;ure, dwelling upon the matchle&s;s qualities of his General. When it was &s;ugge&s;ted, that WASHINGTON was but a man, and that he might &s;oon fall a prey to the great de|&s;troyer; I know, replied the animated &s;oldier, that it is po&s;&s;ible; but it is highly improbable that a man of his worth; of his importance to America, and to the nations of the earth; a man, too, for who&s;e life the prayers of ten thou&s;and chri&s;tians daily a&s;cend to the throne of heaven; <HI>I repeat it,</HI> it is altogether improbable that WASHINGTON &s;hould die.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="037646_0023_100F2C9B03F99400">The inhabitants of the United States have, perhaps, put too much dependence upon this Great Man. In his death, therefore, God is teaching them, that <HI>it is better to tru&s;t in the Lord, than to put confidence in man; it is better to tru&s;t in the Lord, than to put confidence in princes.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The fall of WASHINGTON mu&s;t be con|&s;idered as a frown of God upon this people, to whom he was &s;o very dear.</P>
<P>Never, in the view of &s;ome of our mo&s;t en|lightened citizens, never did the United States &s;tand in greater need of his wi&s;dom, influence, and exertions: &s;o doubtful hang the political &s;cales, both in Europe and America. The time, mo&s;t certainly, is truly critical. The lo&s;s, therefore, of this Great Man, at &s;uch a momentous cri&s;is, ought to be viewed as a judgment, &s;ent by the Ruler of nations, upon the inhabitants of this guilty com|munity. God is now correcting us; and, by this providence, he is calling upon us all, old and young, to repent, and turn to God <HI>from all our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, that iniquity be not our ruin.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. This event affords matter of conviction, to every reflecting mind, that we are greatly indebted
<PB N="26" REF="037646_0024_100F2C9E1CB37150">
to God for pre&s;erving the life of this Great Man to &s;o late a period.</P>
<P>We can recollect times when, if he had been removed, our lo&s;s would have been greater, and his benevolent wi&s;hes to his country incomplete. But he lived to &s;ee our enemies defeated, America independent, the Federal Government e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, commerce flouri&s;hing, agriculture progre&s;&s;ing, the nation ri&s;ing in re&s;pectability, the whole com|munity enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of civil and religious liberty, his fellow citizens in the quiet and full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the means of political and moral felicity.</P>
<P>Contemplating the&s;e de&s;irable events, WASH|INGTON drew his glittering &s;word. And when he &s;aw them accompli&s;hed, he returned it into its &s;cabbard, and retired from the theatre of public life, that he might enjoy the long-wi&s;hed-for fruits of his per&s;evering exertions, viz. his countrymen <HI>&s;it|ing under their vine, and under their figtree, and no one to make them afraid.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, while we deplore the death of this Great Man, let us with grateful hearts acknow|ledge the goodne&s;s of God in continuing him &s;o long a di&s;tingui&s;hed ble&s;&s;ing to the United States.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="27" REF="037646_0025_100F2CA059C51F48">5. Such events, my brethren, taking place in the wi&s;e, benevolent and perfect government of God, may be overruled for the greater happine&s;s of a people.</P>
<P>Soon after Abner's death peace was e&s;tabli&s;hed between I&s;rael and Judah. One of the wi&s;e&s;t of men was placed at the head of the nation, the armies were di&s;banded, the &s;ound of war was heard no more, and Ophir's gold enriched the public trea&s;ury. The temple of the Lord reared its &s;acred head; the tribes of I&s;rael, from Dan to Beer&s;heba, pre&s;ent them&s;elves before, and devoutly wor&s;hip, the God of Abraham. Prayers and prai&s;es a&s;cend to Jehovah. We are informed, that <HI>they went unto their tents joyful, and glad of heart, for all the good|ne&s;s that the Lord had done for his people.</HI> Thus their mourning is turned into joy. The hand of the Lord is more vi&s;ibly &s;een, both in the hour of adver&s;ity and pro&s;perity, and to God they a&s;cribe all the glory.</P>
<P>Although our beloved Friend has <HI>clo&s;ed his eyes,</HI> and now &s;leeps the long &s;leep of death, <HI>the Lord liveth.</HI> He governs his great empire in the mo&s;t de&s;irable manner. The pre&s;ent very affecting pro|vidence,
<PB N="28" REF="037646_0026_100F2CA1E7182208">
connected with, and being part of, his great plan, will be overruled for the di&s;play of his glory, and promote the be&s;t good of all tho&s;e who are reconciled to the divine will; tho&s;e <HI>who love our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in &s;incerity.</HI></P>
<P>God can rai&s;e up men, and qualify them for the mo&s;t important &s;tations in &s;ociety. He can pre|pare the minds of this people to eye his correcting hand in the fall of this great man, General WASHINGTON; and be&s;tow the riche&s;t of his ble&s;&s;ings upon our dear country.</P>
<P>May we hear the voice of in&s;piration, which up|on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion is particularly pertinent: <HI>Put not your tru&s;t in princes, nor in the &s;on of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he re|turneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts peri&s;h. Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, who&s;e hope is in the Lord his God.</HI></P>
<P>May light ari&s;e in darkne&s;s upon the United States, and God be glorified in the &s;alvation of our country.</P>
