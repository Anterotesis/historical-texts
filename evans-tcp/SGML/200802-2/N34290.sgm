<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE object of the pre&s;ent is merely to reque&s;t as the mo&s;t particular favor you can confer on me, the mo&s;t &s;peedy &s;ettlement of your accounts with the Royal Marine. Mr. Swanwick has repeatedly informed me that they are drawn out ready for your examination, and that nothing is wanting but your in&s;pection of the &s;ame and your &s;ignature: pray, oblige me &s;o far as to de&s;patch them.</P>
<P>Permit me al&s;o to reiterate to you, Sir, my reque&s;t, re&s;pecting my accounts as Agent of the Royal Marine with the United States, and which it is my earne&s;t de&s;ire as duty to get &s;ettled; my endeavours to attain this point have hitherto been fruitle&s;s, and in the mean while, I am daily held up as a public defaulter, a character too odious to be &s;upported by any man of principle or feeling. Let me intreat you to renew your in&s;tructions to the public officers, &s;o as every po&s;&s;ible de&s;patch may be given.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I remain with every &s;entiment of re&s;pectful attachment, SIR,

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM informed that, in all probability, his Excellency the Chevalier de la Luzerne will &s;oon return to France: I have therefore to claim your immediate and con&s;tant attention to the accounts of the Royal Marine. I mu&s;t have them, &s;o as the vouchers may be &s;ubmitted to his Excellency, without delay: the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, my re|putation, my intere&s;t and fortune are too deeply concerned, not to claim every exertion on your part. I reque&s;t you will honour me with an an&s;wer, and inform me when I &s;hall po&s;itively receive &s;aid accounts and vouchers. You mu&s;t excu&s;e the earne&s;tne&s;s of my application, and I tru&s;t you'll raze every po&s;&s;ible ob&s;tacle in the way. One thing more I mu&s;t add, that without your accounts, I cannot proceed a &s;ingle &s;tep further: my clerks are at full &s;top, and we are waiting till &s;uch time we are enabled to proceed.</P>

<P>IN con&s;equence of your letter of ye&s;terday, I have <HI>this day</HI> gone into an examination of the accounts as you de|&s;ire, but on looking into the papers which you returned, as tho&s;e you had received from Mr. Swanwick, I find very incorrect copies of my general accounts, in&s;tead of the originals which were &s;ent to you; I mu&s;t therefore re|que&s;t tho&s;e original accounts may be &s;ent immediately, that I may be enabled to proceed and &s;hew <HI>the folly and ab|&s;urdity of tho&s;e ob&s;ervations which occa&s;ion this unnece&s;&s;ary trouble.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM peculiarly happy to find that by your letter of the 15th which I only received ye&s;terday at 10 o'clock in the evening, you have at la&s;t found lei&s;ure to attend to the &s;ettlement of my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ounts. I now &s;end you the original papers you claim.</P>
<P>I cannot let &s;lip this opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing to you, that I not only want the accounts to be examined, but that it will be nece&s;&s;ary that you make them out in a new form, expre&s;&s;ing &s;olely the payments, negociations and receipts of money made by your&s;elf. My tran&s;actions being blended with yours, I have found it utterly impracticable to know with any preci&s;ion our reciprocal &s;ituation, or rather your &s;ituation, with re&s;pect to the Royal Marine&punc; The co+pies of the originals which I reque&s;t you will be &s;o kind as to return me, will enable me to make out &s;eparately the accounts of my own tran&s;actions &s;o &s;oon as I obtain the vouchers which are to &s;upport them, and which you were &s;o obliging as to take charge of, in order that they might be recorded for my &s;afety in the fir&s;t draughts of my pu|blic accounts.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, you &s;hould deem this an unnece&s;&s;ary trouble; I mean not to give you any, but the&s;e accounts are of too high importance to both of us, not to de&s;erve the utmo&s;t care and attention in the redaction thereof.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER what has pa&s;&s;ed in writing and conver&s;ation betwixt us, it is with very great reluctance I &s;it down, to write you on the &s;ubject of my private and public accounts; but as you told me repeatedly ye&s;terday, that you wi&s;hed I &s;hould indicate, in the fir&s;t place, a mode of rendering the &s;aid accounts, and, in the &s;econd place, that I &s;hould write you on the &s;ubject of depreciation, I &s;hall now endeavour to expre&s;s my ideas on the&s;e two points, and, I hope, to your &s;atisfaction and conviction.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="044903_0004_101F4EF65F85F628">I want not that you &s;hould, in any in&s;tance, depart from the u&s;ual, exact, mercantile mode or manner in rendering my public or private accounts. In abiding by the rules laid down for the &s;ame, you will &s;tate preci&s;ely the day on which you have received or paid any <HI>money for me,</HI> either on behalf of the Royal Marine, or for my per&s;onal account with you. I doubt not that you'll admit this to be nece&s;&s;ary in all accounts whatever, both in &s;pecie and in conti|nental money; but much more &s;o for the latter, and for the following rea&s;ons:</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, without the preci&s;e date of the time when each tran&s;action took place is &s;pecified in the account, it would not be a true &s;tatement or account thereof. Secondly, Without the preci&s;e date, no value can be fixed on the apparent &s;um paid or received.</P>
<P>This being premi&s;ed, if you will plea&s;e to proceed to the examination of &s;uch of your accounts, as have come to my knowledge, you'll clearly remark the nece&s;&s;ity of altering and correcting them.</P>
<P>I have already wrote you, and repeatedly told you of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eparating both the public and private tran&s;actions, which are per&s;onal to me, from tho&s;e which regard your&s;elf. This is indi&s;pen&s;able, in order that each of us may be re&s;pon&s;ible for his own operations.</P>
<P>In the public accounts, was I to &s;ettle finally with you on them, in the form they were fir&s;t propo&s;ed, I &s;hould ultimately become re&s;pon&s;ible for your operations, and you for mine&mdash;this cannot be.</P>
<P>In the private accounts, your tran&s;actions being blended with mine, the concerns of various other individuals being al&s;o blended with mine and yours, it is impo&s;&s;ible to know from the dates that appear on them, what is the right of each individual, or to judge what is ju&s;t to allow them, to you, or to me. One of the private accounts as propo&s;ed, I &s;uppo&s;e not rendered, much le&s;s &s;ettled betwixt us, bears no &s;ignature, no date for the balance that is apparent; tho' it is for a &s;um not le&s;s than 551,514 pounds. The credit is compo&s;ed of twenty-two articles, the debit of thirty-one, and notwith&s;tanding, there are only five dates on the debit, not one on the credit; tho' all the &s;ums are in continental &s;pecie. This certainly cannot be an account on which a &s;ettlement can have been intended by you. However that may be, it would be folly indeed on my part, to admit it as it now &s;tands, without the vouchers and accounts, on which it is grounded, will ju&s;tify the pre&s;ent &s;tatement of the tran&s;actions it relates to.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting the &s;ubject of depreciation, I know not why you de&s;ired I &s;hould write you on it; much le&s;s
<Q>why you &s;hould fir&s;t have offered to me, to certify in writing, that you could not and would not grant any depreciation on your public accounts; nor, why you &s;hould have argued ye&s;terday, that becau&s;e the King had made great &s;avings, by the operations of the Royal Marine <HI>under my directions,</HI> you are not to account <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>me</HI> on his behalf, and make good depreciation, if any lo&s;s has en&s;ued: The propo&s;ition you made to me, verbally, in an&s;wer to my letter of the 16th, and the argument you repeatedly urged to me ye&s;terday.</Q></P>
<P>This propo&s;ition, you well know, is of &s;uch a nature, as cannot be accepted of by me; nor can you, on &s;erious reflexion, indulge the thought one moment.</P>
<P>As to the great &s;avings made to the King by my operations in Bo&s;ton, &s;urely they are not tho&s;e you &s;eriou&s;ly alluded to, in order to give them as rea&s;ons, for not adju&s;ting your accounts on a proper footing, and making good all depreciation, in every ca&s;e where it may be ju&s;tly due. Tho&s;e operations are per&s;onal to me alone, and the King, thro' his &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, was duly informed thereof. If the &s;avings made thereon are now to be given up, by the mode of adju&s;ting and intermixing accounts, I &s;hall per&s;onally lo&s;e the merit of my own tran&s;actions, and the King be deprived of that &s;hare of tho&s;e advantages to which my attention and indu&s;try has given him the faire&s;t title. The&s;e rea&s;ons, I am confident, are &s;ufficient to ground my earne&s;t reque&s;t, that my tran&s;actions in Bo&s;ton,
<PB N="4" REF="044903_0005_101F4EF842387758">
be not any ways, or any longer, blended or connected in account with yours. I have too much rea&s;on to fear that the &s;tatements thereof, intermixed with your accounts, might occa&s;ion &s;ome erroneous inductions; which, I am certain, you never meant &s;hould take place.</P>
<P>The &s;avings made for the King, by your operations, will be&s;t appear from the accounts, when they will &s;tand alone, unconnected with any others; when they will be &s;tated at the preci&s;e dates of receipt and payments, and not at the dates when the entries were made in your books. Let the advantages, gained thereon, be placed again&s;t the lo&s;&s;es, &s;uffered by depreciation; this is fair and ju&s;t; this is all you certainly can mean or pretend to; and this needs no previous determination.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not now add much on my private affairs, and the &s;tatements that have been propo&s;ed thereon; but, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I will not admit them, even for examination, without the tran&s;actions, per&s;onal to you, are clearly di&s;tinct from mine. Let them be joined to the vouchers belonging to them, and al&s;o with the accounts on which they are grounded, for my in&s;pection, and then I &s;hall &s;ee and know what I may have further to &s;ay on them.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the re&s;ult of your accounts with me, when your tran&s;actions for others, and mine with and for others, are &s;eparated from your accounts with me, is immaterial at pre&s;ent. But it is of the utmo&s;t importance, to your honor and mine, that the &s;ettlement of accounts, which has been totally laid a&s;ide for much too long a period, &s;hould at lea&s;t now be finally adju&s;ted and &s;ettled betwixt us, without any further delay, for any po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on. Without this, neither you nor I can receive or render that ju&s;tice due to each of us, nor to tho&s;e, who&s;e concerns have been entru&s;ted to our good faith, care and management.</P>
<P>As the vouchers, in &s;upport of my per&s;onal tran&s;actions in Bo&s;ton, can be no longer of any u&s;e to you, as they are of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, and nece&s;&s;ary to the progre&s;s of my public accounts, I reque&s;t you'll be &s;o kind as to &s;end 'em to me, by a &s;afe hand, &s;o &s;oon as you can conveniently collect them: and at the &s;ame time the original accounts of Thomas Ru&s;&s;ell, Jon. Williams, and John Rowe, of Bo&s;ton, with me, and all others which may relate to my private or per&s;onal accounts and tran&s;actions; &s;o as I may proceed to &s;ettle them by my&s;elf. I will return a regular di&s;charge or receipt for the whole, if you deem it proper or nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>You &s;hewed me ye&s;terday in your hand a &s;tatement, which you &s;aid you had ju&s;t then been making, in order to value the &s;avings made on my Bo&s;ton tran&s;actions; which you found to amount to a very high &s;um, indeed. But permit me to a&s;k you, Why all this unnece&s;&s;ary trouble? Is it on my account? Surely you do not mean to claim for your&s;elf tho&s;e &s;avings? In order to e&s;tabli&s;h your right thereto, I have this morning, for the very fir&s;t time, examined how your accounts, with me, did &s;tand at that period. I arrived here, from Bo&s;ton, on the 24th day of December, 1778; I have, therefore, &s;tated your private and public accounts with me, &s;eparately, on the 31&s;t day of December of that year. Their in&s;pection will elucidate whether or not the individuals, who&s;e money and pro|perty I had at my di&s;po&s;al in Bo&s;ton, and the King, have or have not a ju&s;t and indi&s;putable right to the &s;avings I there made. I &s;hall renounce all claims to the&s;e great &s;avings, on their behalf, if you'll plea&s;e to &s;how the &s;malle&s;t &s;hadow or appearance of right to them.</P>
<P>I earne&s;tly entreat you to weigh the above ob&s;ervations in your mind, and that you'll permit me to conclude by renewing to you the a&s;&s;urance of the &s;incere attachment, with which I &s;hall not cea&s;e to remain,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY your letter of this day, you a&s;k me this plain que&s;tion:
<Q>Did you not de&s;ire me, when I fir&s;t agreed to a&s;&s;i&s;t you, to comprehend all the accounts of the Royal Marine, under your direction, in my accounts; without regarding whether the bu&s;ine&s;s had been performed by you or by me, or by your or my orders?</Q>
I &s;hall make you immediately as plain an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>When you fir&s;t agreed to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, I could not po&s;&s;ibly have de&s;ired you, to comprehend all accounts of the Royal Marine, under my direction, in your accounts; without regarding, whether the bu&s;ine&s;s had been performed by you or me, or by your or my orders. I &s;ay, it could not po&s;&s;ibly be; becau&s;e, when you fir&s;t agreed to act as my agent, no one operation had taken place, no one operation or bu&s;ine&s;s had been performed, either by you or me.</P>
<P>I might make &s;ome further ob&s;ervations on this que&s;tion; but I will not enter into u&s;ele&s;s di&s;&s;ertations or di&s;cu&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t certainly mean to render me &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice; you mu&s;t mean to render it to the King, and to all who have entru&s;ted you with their concerns. My intentions are perfectly &s;imilar to yours, and I do not mean any thing el&s;e, than to obtain it &s;peedily from you; as well as to render it al&s;o to you, in all po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es. On this ground let your accounts per&s;onal be &s;tated &s;eparately from tho&s;e per&s;onal to me, in the u&s;ual, regular, mercantile mode or manner; &s;o as they may be clearly under&s;tood, and our re&s;pective intere&s;ts and concerns as ea&s;ily e&s;tabli&s;hed: and we &s;hall undoubtedly part hereafter on the &s;ame footing we have hitherto lived.</P>
<P>But, Sir, I mu&s;t repeat to you, that my Bo&s;ton tran&s;actions &s;hall not be blended with yours. I affirm that I never intended, much le&s;s agreed to or con&s;ented, that they &s;hould be rendered by you at any one period. I never permitted they &s;hould be anyways blended with your accounts; but in that very incomplete &s;tatement of the then &s;ituation of the affairs, committed to my care, during Mon&s;ieur Gerard's re&s;idence here, which it was proper to let him have, for his information, before his departure for France.</P>
<P>When I carried you the papers and notes I had made and drawn up in Bo&s;ton, on my return from thence, in December 1778, I pray'd you to oblige me &s;o far, as to draw up an account of my tran&s;actions there, &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from all others; to &s;tate them in a &s;eparate book or paper, and to keep the vouchers till I &s;hould want or call for them: telling you, I &s;hould think them &s;afer in your hands than in mine, and that your &s;tatement of my tran&s;actions, in a regular form, would, on a future day, a&s;&s;i&s;t my memory in redacting and rendering my accounts. This, Sir, you complied with; and, in con&s;equence thereof, you drew 'em up in one &s;et of &s;heets, which you gave me, &s;ome time afterwards, to keep for my direction.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="044903_0007_101F4EFCE34849A0">I have &s;ince then ob&s;erved, that this account is thus entitled:
<Q>Debtor, JOHN HOLKER, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in Bo&s;ton, acc^t curr^t^. with ROBERT MORRIS, Creditor.</Q>
By this &s;uper&s;cription it would almo&s;t appear, that I was accomptable to you, and not you to me; but I am convinced you do not think me quite &s;o great a fool, as to have ever e&s;tabli&s;hed you Agent General over my&s;elf: however, I overlooked the &s;uper&s;cription and thought it was merely a method or form adopted, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h a regular account, that might &s;erve for my future in&s;truction at a later day.</P>
<P>You'll plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that the tran&s;actions therein related are either per&s;onal to me, or to the Chev. De Borda, Major of that fleet which the Count D'E&s;taing commanded. This ob&s;ervation, you mu&s;t recollect, I made you, and gave it as a &s;pecial rea&s;on for &s;tating them di&s;tinctly from your other accounts, and for giving me up the papers, on which they were to be &s;tated and redacted; you &s;till retaining the vouchers and my notes, for their and mine ultimate and additional &s;afety.</P>
<P>At the period, when M. Gerard mentioned his re&s;olution of returning to France, I then told you of the propriety of &s;hewing him an account of the expenditures of the Royal Marine. You ob&s;erved, in reply, that the bu&s;ine&s;s was only in train, and that it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible that anything, like an exact account, could be produced: that, among other agents, M. Smith of Baltimore, in particular, had rendered none; tho' very heavy advances had been made him by you. I agreed, therefore, to the propo&s;ition you then made, that a &s;tatement &s;hould be redacted of &s;uch tran&s;actions only, as could then be &s;upported by vouchers in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. You ob&s;erved, you would al&s;o make out a &s;eparate account of my Bo&s;ton tran&s;actions, and that you would include the &s;ame therein. This la&s;t fore|going part of this &s;tory, is as near truth as I can remember. This &s;aid account was afterwards in&s;erted in your public account; and, by one particular line or article, in conformity to the real and true &s;pirit of my intentions, when you undertook to draw up for me the little book I have before mentioned. When this &s;eparate account was drawn up, or about being drawn up, you told me that you had a great deal of trouble in redacting the&s;e accounts for me; that you had paid or received my bills drawn from Bo&s;ton on you, or in your favour; and, that a commi&s;&s;ion, of two and a half per cent. would not be more than adequate for your time and trouble. You added, that I ought to pretend to as much, in order to defray my travelling expences, &amp;c. &amp;c. I did agree to allow a commi&s;&s;ion of two and a half per cent. and, in con&s;equence of this imprudent con&s;ent, it was &s;o pa&s;t and introduced in that form (tho' it is a very incomplete &s;tatement of my Bo&s;ton tran&s;actions) among your other accounts. But, Sir, rather than this commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould any longer retard the redaction and &s;ettlement of my accounts, I agree that you &s;hall pa&s;s in your accounts a &s;um equivalent to 5 per cent. on the amount of that particular account, which you &s;o properly blended with your own, tho' I have repeatedly declared to you, and mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly, that I will not partake of any copper thereof, nor of any other commi&s;&s;ion whatever; and tho' I &s;hall certainly credit the Chev. De Borda for two and a half per cent. on the &s;aid amount, in favour of the King, becau&s;e I am &s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of my con&s;ent to your propo&s;ition; and, becau&s;e it is ju&s;t, I &s;hould not only refund the King, but al&s;o, if nece&s;&s;ary and you &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on it, &s;uffer for the indelicacy of the tran&s;action, &s;o far as it regards me.</P>
<P>All the above circum&s;tances mu&s;t be pre&s;ent to your mind; you'll likewi&s;e recollect that immediately after you had agreed to be my agent in Philadelphia and al&s;o to a&s;&s;i&s;t me with your good advice, I entreated you three different times, to open a new &s;et of books for all the tran&s;actions of the Royal Marine, in order to keep the accounts &s;epa|rate and di&s;tinct from all others, and in order that I might have a daily recour&s;e to them, or produce them, to whom it might concern. If ever I thought it proper or nece&s;&s;ary. This fact I &s;tated fully to you the la&s;t time I &s;aw you, and you told me you remembered it well; and, likewi&s;e the an&s;wer you made me at the time; which was, that
<PB N="7" REF="044903_0008_101F4F00E3E335C8">
it would be &s;omewhat inconvenient and unnece&s;&s;ary; becau&s;e you would hold your&s;elf con&s;tantly ready to give me the accounts, when I &s;hould want them, or any information I &s;hould chu&s;e thereon.</P>
<P>When I la&s;t &s;aw you at your office, you &s;hew'd me a number of papers relative, &s;aid you, to the accounts of the Royal Marine, which would undoubtedly remove all my groundle&s;s and injurious &s;u&s;picions and prove that you had employed every dollar, or nearly every dollar, (I don't recollect po&s;itively the exact expre&s;&s;ion) which you had re|ceived for the King's account. You mu&s;t remember how forcibly I was &s;truck, on remarking the great number of tran&s;actions therein apparently &s;tated; I told you that I had never &s;een them or heard of them, till you mentioned &s;ome &s;uch an account in your la&s;t vi&s;it to me; but, al&s;o, that I had forbid Mr. Turnbull repeatedly from blending his accounts with yours. You an&s;wered, that Mr. Turnbull, by who&s;e actions I was naturally bound, being my agent, had received them, or copies of them, &s;ome time after you had declined my public bu&s;ine&s;s; that Mr. Swanwick had delivered them to him, him&s;elf, by your order, after your peru&s;al and examination of the&s;e &s;aid accounts, and that I &s;hould &s;till find them in Mr. Turnbull's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in who&s;e hands they had certainly remained ever &s;ince that time: all this you mu&s;t well recollect, &s;ince it happened betwixt us the day before la&s;t. Now, Sir, on enquiry I find, that Mr. Turnbull did receive &s;ome &s;uch papers; they were delivered to him by Mr. Swanwick, and retaken by him from Mr. Turnbull, one or two days afterwards. It may be e&s;&s;ential, in order to remove all difficulties betwixt us, that I &s;hould immediately &s;ee tho&s;e papers; I therefore reque&s;t you'll either entru&s;t me with the original draft, or with the copy pre&s;ented by Mr. Swanwick, who will be be&s;t able to give full information re&s;pecting them and this part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ince he was the redacter thereof. However this may be, why did not you communicate the&s;e accounts to me at that time, and why, after Mr. Swanwick retook them, have not all my accounts been &s;ettled for the&s;e three years pa&s;t? Why have you not &s;ent me your accounts with Mr. Smith, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t my operations and the examination of his accounts, when you knew that I had a per&s;on employed in Baltimore to &s;ettle them with him, &amp;c. &amp;c.? You mu&s;t &s;ee that I can make que&s;tions al&s;o; but it is unnece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer them, wihout you chu&s;e it; for all I want is my public and per&s;onal accounts, and &s;uch other papers which are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to me, and which I claimed from you in my letter of ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>It is not my de&s;ire to elude any further preparatory que&s;tions from you; but, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that a long corre&s;pondence will only occa&s;ion delays in rendering and &s;ettling finally accounts betwixt us, which it is &s;o incum|bent on you and me to have done with.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will receive with this letter, a &s;tate of my accounts with you, both in your public and private capacity; together with &s;uch ob&s;ervations as may &s;erve to explain them fully, and if farther explanations &s;hould be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, I will readily go into them. After a due examination of all the&s;e accounts, you will be able to judge, whe|ther you was authori&s;ed to &s;uppo&s;e that a de&s;ire to withold a balance from you has influenced me to delay the &s;ettle|ment. In your letter of the 24th of la&s;t month you a&s;k
<Q>why have not all my accounts been &s;ettled for the&s;e three years pa&s;t?</Q>
To this que&s;tion I am now about to reply, without noticing what is &s;aid on the &s;ame &s;ubject in
<PB N="8" REF="044903_0009_101F4F03A0097E08">
your previous letter of the 23d, or your &s;ub&s;equent letters of the 27th of la&s;t month, and of the 8th and 13th in&s;t. You will remember, Sir, that you introduced your&s;elf to my acquaintance in the beginning of July, 1778, and pre&s;&s;ed me to undertake the tran&s;action of your affairs. The con&s;ideration held out to me was, that very great &s;ums of money would naturally come to my hands, and might be occa&s;ionally employed in u&s;eful &s;peculations <HI>on our joint account,</HI> and that the commi&s;&s;ion <HI>(al&s;o to be divided between us)</HI> would be very con&s;iderable. You will remember that I declined your propo&s;als (though urged upon me for &s;everal days) telling you that my private affairs called for my whole attention, that my public occupations for &s;ome time had prevented the &s;ettlement of old and important ac|counts, and that I &s;hould not, without injury to my&s;elf and others, engage in new pur&s;uits. You may remember, al&s;o, that you urged it as a kind of obligation, to take care of the intere&s;ts of a King, who was in the act of affording &s;uch generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance to my country, and called on me, if I would not act my&s;elf, to point out &s;ome per&s;on for whom I would be re&s;pon&s;ible. At length you drew from me <HI>my reluctant con&s;ent</HI>; and whatever el&s;e may happen, I have at lea&s;t the plea&s;ure to reflect that the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me, was faithfully executed, until it was delivered over in the &s;pring of the year 1780, to the hou&s;e of W. Turnbull and Comp.</P>
<P>As you was not only agent for your &s;overeign, but al&s;o for many individuals trading to this country, or &s;peculating in our public funds, the concerns which I engaged in for you, were both numerous and important. On &s;ome a commi&s;&s;ion was charged, and on others it was not; but <HI>in every commi&s;&s;ion you was by agreement to &s;hare one half.</HI> For the proof of this I will, out of many other materials, &s;elect only for the pre&s;ent, what is &s;aid in your letter of the twenty-fourth of la&s;t month, and your letter of the nineteenth in&s;tant, explaining away the groundle&s;s a&s;&s;ertion it contains as a mi&s;take. I mu&s;t, however, ob&s;erve, that the only objection you made to the half commi&s;&s;ion, when Mr. Swanwick delivered you the account thereof, was, as to its value; and to me you never declared again&s;t taking it, until a conver&s;ation we had in the office of Finance in November or December la&s;t. You repeated the refu&s;al at your own hou&s;e the 22d of la&s;t month, and the next day at my hou&s;e: and then reminded me, in your letter of the 24th of la&s;t month, how frequently you had declared again&s;t taking this commi&s;&s;ion. To me it is immateria whether you take it or not. I agreed to divide all commi&s;&s;ions charged on the affairs tran&s;acted for you, both on account of the Royal Marine and on account of individuals; and have therefore rendered that account with the others, and credited you for the half which belongs to you. By the li&s;t of accounts annexed to this letter it will appear, that before the month of June, 1780, forty-one different accounts were delivered by me to you, and our tran&s;actions clo&s;ed as far as the actual &s;ituation of things could well admit of. In the autumn of that year a &s;ettlement of your accounts was attempted, but it could not be effected; becau&s;e neither you nor I could obtain &s;everal of the nece&s;&s;ary materials. I have many of your notes and other documents on this &s;ubject, but what you &s;ay in yours of the 25th of January, 1781, is &s;ufficient:
<Q>I cannot obtain, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t earne&s;t and repeated applications to the trea&s;ury, the valuation of the provi&s;ions furni&s;hed to the Royal Marine, by the Continental Commi&s;&s;aries, in the run of 1779. I intreat you to put on the &s;ame the pre&s;ent current value thereof, &s;o as to clo&s;e and tran&s;mit your ac|counts with all po&s;&s;ible convenient &s;peed. I &s;hall hereafter &s;ettle the ju&s;t valuation my&s;elf with the commi&s;&s;aries, and will under&s;tand with you thereon per&s;onally, if any difference &s;hould ari&s;e.</Q>
I mu&s;t ob&s;erve (in this place) that I do not like to render &s;uch accounts, and &s;till le&s;s to come to a &s;ettlement <HI>in appearance,</HI> when the real &s;ettle|ment remains behind. It was not before the middle of May, 1781, that I obtained the account of Ephraim Blaine, one of the Continental Commi&s;&s;aries, and therefore I could not before that period have &s;ettled with you. But why did I not then make the &s;ettlement? I had then accepted the office I now hold, and was (in con&s;equence) obliged
<PB N="9" REF="044903_0010_101F4F0551A95108">
to refer all my former affairs to the direction of others. But if you had urged a &s;ettlement, even when I was mo&s;t engaged, with half that &s;olicitude and impetuo&s;ity which you now have put en, I would have taken hours from my &s;leep rather than have expo&s;ed my&s;elf to the charges and &s;u&s;picions (which I have only di&s;covered of late were in your mind) although in the event they will appear to be totally unfounded. As to what you &s;ay of the Chevalier de la Luzerne's application on the &s;ubject of your public accounts in his letter of the 4th October la&s;t, I will leave your own heart to make the comment. It is &s;ufficient for me to ob&s;erve, that if you a&s;ked this application with the view of urging me (per&s;onally) to&punc; &s;ettlement, you ought to have a&s;ked it, when that gentleman fir&s;t pre&s;&s;ed you on the part of his court. But you knew full well my willingne&s;s to &s;ettle with you at any moment, if it were po&s;&s;ible to &s;pare the time from my public avocations. Mr. Swanwick whom I had empowered to &s;ettle the&s;e as well as other of my accounts, laboured with you from time to time in the bu&s;ine&s;s, my books and papers were always open to you, and at your reque&s;t, on the &s;ixth of March la&s;t, he delivered to Mr. Betheder a number of rough &s;tatements of ac|counts, &s;ome formerly made by me, others by him&s;elf, together with all the vouchers and al&s;o the account &s;ettled the 31&s;t Augu&s;t 1779, in pre&s;ence of Mon&s;r. Gerard. The&s;e were detained until &s;ome time in November or December la&s;t, when you &s;ent a bundle or two of papers containing a part of them to my hou&s;e.</P>
<P>About that time you mentioned to me in my office, that I was indebted 169,000 <HI>Livres</HI> to the Royal Marine, and gave me to under&s;tand that you collected your information from Mr. Turnbull; you know my &s;urpri&s;e on that occa|&s;ion. I told you, it was impo&s;&s;ible; but that as &s;oon as Mr. Governeur Morris returned from New-york, and &s;ome immediate bu&s;ine&s;s of the office was di&s;patched, I would attend to the &s;ettlement of tho&s;e accounts. On the 14th of January I received your letter, pre&s;&s;ing for a &s;ettlement; on the fifteenth I &s;et about it, and (for the fir&s;t time) opened the bundles of papers you had &s;ent to my hou&s;e. To my very great &s;urpri&s;e, I found that the rough drafts of my accounts were detained, and imperfect copies &s;ent, and that very improper remarks were made on tho&s;e accounts. In my letter of the 15th I a&s;ked the original accounts, and, in an&s;wer to it, you mention a de&s;ire that they &s;hould now be rendered in a new form; which, by the remarks made by the per&s;on you had employed on my accounts, was done, I find, at his in&s;tigation. This reque&s;t I &s;hall pre&s;ently have occa&s;ion to take notice of; however on receiv|ing tho&s;e originals, I was a&s;toni&s;hed to find various &s;cratches, notes and obliterations had been made in them (even in that which was &s;igned by Mon&s;r. Gerard and your&s;elf). On the 22d day of January ('till which time you could not &s;ee me) I called on you and complained of this extraordinary conduct, which you could not defend. You then let me know (for the fir&s;t time) your claim of depreciation; which you at the &s;ame time acknowledged you had never thought of 'till lately. I told you, I would never allow it. And in reply to your que&s;tion, "what will the King's mini&s;ter &s;ay" I told you, I did not care, and offered to give a certificate under my hand, that I would not pay it. I reque&s;ted you to come to my hou&s;e the next day, that you might be convinced from my books how much you had injured me by &s;uppo&s;ing, I was in debt to the Royal Marine, and entertaining (as I had lately perceived you did) &s;u&s;picions unworthy both of you and me. You came and I opened my books to you, and begun an exa|mination of tho&s;e articles of my accounts again&s;t which objections had been made by the per&s;on you had employed to make ob&s;ervations on them; the fir&s;t article we took up was Col. Mitchell's account, and finding all the objections to that account were unfounded, you grew tired of this mode of refutation, and &s;eemed de&s;irous to get rid of it. I told you that I could with the &s;ame ea&s;e &s;hew the folly and ab&s;urdity of all the other objections; I then &s;hewed you the rough draft of an account current with Wm. Turnbull &amp; Co. which brought my accounts with the Royal Ma|rine to a clo&s;e, by transferring the balances to my accounts with that hou&s;e, which had been done by your order. This &s;eemed to alarm you, and you declated <HI>you had never &s;een that account.</HI> We had a good deal of conver&s;ation
<PB N="10" REF="044903_0011_101F4F089E34C9C0">
which clo&s;ed with my de&s;ire that you would &s;end the form in which you cho&s;e to have your accounts rendered, and a&s;&s;ign in writing the rea&s;ons on which you a&s;ked for depreciation. The objects of this reque&s;t were that (if po&s;&s;ible) I might reduce the accounts to the required form, and that if you &s;hould (on reflection) ri&s;que the demand of depreciation, I might have an opportunity once for all to conte&s;t it. Before I quit the above mentioned conver&s;ation, it is proper to add, that in con&s;equence of what you then &s;aid, and of what is contained in your letter of thy twenty fourth of January, I have enquired more particularly into the &s;tate of facts, and I find that Mr. Swan|wick delivered the account in que&s;tion to your &s;aid agents Wm. Turnbull and Co. that it remained with them &s;ome months, that he received it back to correct the omi&s;&s;ion of one or two trifling charges which were on their books again&s;t me, that he did not return it becau&s;e M&s;&s;rs. Turnbull and Co. had entered it on their books, that they have delivered to Mr. Swanwick two &s;tatements of accounts conformable to it, that Mr. Swanwick informed you he had delivered this account to Mr. Turnbull, that you applied for it to him, and (Mr. Turnbull tells me) that you cer|tainly was furni&s;hed with a copy of it. This &s;tate of facts which can be &s;upported by the evidence of Mr. Swanwick and Mr. Turnbull&mdash;you may (if you plea&s;e) contra&s;t with the declarations you have made in writing, and in con|ver&s;ation. On the twenty &s;eventh of January Mr. Cottringer called on my part for &s;ome of tho&s;e vouchers delivered by Mr. Swanwick to Mr. Betbeder, but you not being at home he called again next day, <HI>and the vouchers confiden|tially entru&s;ted were refu&s;ed.</HI> The foregoing true hi&s;tory contains the rea&s;ons why your accounts have not yet been finally &s;ettled, and prepares the way for another point which of late you have much laboured.</P>
<P>In your letter of the 23d of January la&s;t you tell me
<Q>I will not admit the private accounts <HI>even for examination</HI> without the tran&s;actions per&s;onal to you are clearly di&s;tinct from mine.</Q>
How does this agree with the a&s;&s;ertion contained in your &s;ame letter?
<Q>It is of the utmo&s;t importance <HI>to your honor and mine,</HI> that the &s;ettlement of ac|counts which has been totally laid a&s;ide <HI>for much too long a period</HI> &s;hould at lea&s;t now be finally adju&s;ted and &s;ettled betwixt us <HI>without any further delay for any po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on.</HI></Q>
I mu&s;t leave you, Sir, to reconcile the&s;e and other things which do not con&s;i&s;t too well together, but <HI>I &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;ure you that I will not render my accounts in any other form than that in which they are now &s;ent.</HI> My rea&s;ons are the&s;e: Fir&s;t, the&s;e accounts agree with my books which can be &s;upported by proper evidence; 2ly, if I rendered them in any other form, they might be invalidated by contra&s;ting them with tho&s;e already in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; 3ly, although I was very de&s;irous of indulging your wi&s;h on this occa&s;ion, yet I cannot now do it, for the confidence I repo&s;ed in you is gone; 4ly, the accounts, as rendered, contain that &s;ub|&s;tantial ju&s;tice you &s;peak of, and therefore it is not nece&s;&s;ary to change the form on that account. You may from the accounts in their pre&s;ent form make ju&s;t &s;uch &s;tatements as you &s;hall think proper, and if on comparing them, I find no e&s;&s;ential difference, <HI>I will give a proper certificate thereof</HI>; but more I will not do.</P>
<P>In your letter of the 23d January you ob&s;erve, that the King, through his Secretaries of State, was duly informed of your operations in Bo&s;ton; that, by the mode of adju&s;ting and intermingling accounts, you &s;hall per&s;onally lo&s;e the merit of your own tran&s;actions, and that the &s;avings made for the King, by my operations, will be&s;t appear from the accounts when they will &s;tand alone. Whether the informations you gave to the King were well or ill founded, it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire; whether the &s;tate of facts will or will not do you honor, I am no longer &s;olicitous; but I hope they may. As to my&s;elf, I claim from the King neither thanks, nor honors, nor rewards. I &s;hall never give my&s;elf a moment's concern, whether he gained or lo&s;t in tho&s;e tran&s;actions, which I performed by your order; I owed him no duty, he had confided to me no tru&s;t, nor conferred on me any authority; <HI>if he had, I would have executed his tru&s;t with fidelity</HI>; you are re&s;pon&s;ible to him and may render &s;uch accounts as you think proper; mine with you, I &s;end with this letter. In your &s;ame letter of the twenty-third of January, you dwell on the &s;ame argu|ments,
<PB N="11" REF="044903_0012_101F4F0C73240698">
and &s;ay:
<Q>I am convinced you do not think me quite &s;o great a fool, as to have e&s;tabli&s;hed you Agent General over my&s;elf.</Q>
To <HI>all</HI> this my an&s;wer is very &s;imple: you are, I &s;uppo&s;e, an&s;werable to the King; but whether you are or not, is none of my affair. As to the bu&s;ine&s;s I performed for you, I mu&s;t an&s;wer it to you, and I do this by &s;hewing a compliance to your orders. Robert Morris accounts to the Agent of the Royal Marine; John Holker, Daniel Bell, John Rowe and others, tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s on account of the Royal Marine in Bo&s;ton; the Agent General makes tho&s;e Gentlemen accountable to Robert Morris, by placing the accounts of tho&s;e tran&s;actions in his hands, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of introducing their accounts into his, &s;o that the Agent General may have the whole in one view in the accounts of Robert Morris, and for the purpo&s;e of ju&s;tifying the charge of a com|mi&s;&s;ion thereon, one half of which is to be drawn by the Agent General, by agreement, and the other half by Robert Morris. If the accounts of tho&s;e Gentlemen do not plea&s;e you, I care not; for I did not employ them, and in&s;erted their accounts in mine by your order. In my letter of the twenty-fourth of January I a&s;ked this que&s;tion: "Whether you did not de&s;ire me to comprehend all the accounts of the Royal Marine in my accounts?" It would have &s;aved time at lea&s;t if you had an&s;wered plainly in the affirmative. The fact was, that the account of your Bo&s;ton tran&s;actions, as well as all other of the&s;e accounts, was in&s;erted in mine by your order, <HI>that the whole might appear in one point of view, and a commi&s;&s;ion be charged on the whole.</HI> You have &s;tated this matter &s;omewhat dif|ferently, in your letter of the &s;ixteenth of January, &s;peaking of the vouchers to that Bo&s;ton account, you &s;ay,
<Q>which you were &s;o obliging as to take charge of, in order that they might be recorded for my &s;afety, in the fir&s;t draught of my public accounts.</Q>
In your letter of the twenty-third of January, you &s;ay,
<Q>My Bo&s;ton tran&s;|actions &s;hall never be blended with yours; I affirm, that I <HI>never</HI> intended, <HI>much le&s;s agreed or con&s;ented,</HI> that they &s;hould be <HI>rendered</HI> by you.</Q>
And in your letter of the twenty-fourth of January, you &s;ay,
<Q>When I carried you the papers and notes I had made and drawn up in Bo&s;ton, I prayed you to <HI>draw up</HI> an account of my tran&s;actions there, &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from all others, to &s;tate them in a &s;eparate book or paper, and <HI>to keep the vouchers till I &s;hould want or call for them</HI>; telling you, I &s;hould think them &s;afer in your hands than in mine.</Q>
In that &s;ame letter you mention other things, relative to a commi&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e tran&s;actions, in which your memory &s;erved you &s;o badly, that your letter of the nineteenth in&s;tant has been written to correct one error. Your relation of this matter would &s;eem to turn on this point: <HI>That you conceived your papers to be &s;afer in my cu&s;tody than in your own.</HI> But how is this po&s;&s;ible? You admit, that it was agreed, a commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be charged by me on this tran&s;action. How could that be, without bringing the whole into my accounts? You &s;ay that the&s;e tran&s;actions were to be recorded in your fir&s;t public accounts. In the fir&s;t accounts <HI>&s;ettled</HI> you admit the amount of them was carried out in one line, agreeably to the original intention. Now, Sir, I have in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a &s;tate of tho&s;e tran&s;actions, as rendered by me for &s;ettlement, and joined thereto, is written, not only Mr. Gerard's certificate that he had compared it, &amp;c. &amp;c. but the following words &s;igned by you, "<HI>vu, verifi&eacute; &amp; approuv&eacute; par nous &agrave; Philadelphie,</HI> 9 <HI>Sept.</HI> 1779." After doing this how can you at this hour pretend, that <HI>you never intended much le&s;s agreed to or con&s;ented</HI> that the&s;e accounts &s;hould be rendered by me? But this is not all: &s;everal of your tran&s;actions in Bo&s;ton were included in and pro|duced in &s;upport of an account entitled
<Q>John Holker, E&s;qr; Agent of the Royal Marine of France in account cur|rent with Robert Morris of Philadelphia on account of &s;aid Marine</Q>
To make out this account you your&s;elf fur|ni&s;hed me with your own minutes with John Rowe's accounts, Daniel Bell's, the Continental Navy Board's, Miller and Tracey's, Nathaniel Rugles's, Jon. Williams's, Thomas Ru&s;&s;ell's and the Board of War's at Bo&s;ton: And you your&s;elf was pre&s;ent, not only at the adju&s;tment of this account before Mon&s;r. Gerard, but al&s;o when the entries were made by me in my books, <HI>and you have &s;igned the account.</HI> I do acknowledge that <HI>you propo&s;ed my opening a &s;et
<PB N="12" REF="044903_0013_101F4F0F20DB9348">
of books</HI> for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Royal Marine, but upon my objecting that a multiplicity of books were apt to create confu&s;ion and &s;ubjected accountants to a greater chance of error, you acquie&s;ced in the introduction of tho&s;e as well as the private affairs entru&s;ted to your management, into my books, and after that acquie&s;cence, objections made now to an&s;wer your own purpo&s;es, can have no weight, <HI>e&s;pecially</HI> as the accounts, I render, are ju&s;t, fair and honor|able. To the&s;e convincing evidences of <HI>your agreement and con&s;ent,</HI> I can add al&s;o <HI>your directions.</HI> I have in my po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion a li&s;t of bills drawn by you at Bo&s;ton for the u&s;e of the Royal marine, to which is added <HI>by you</HI> the following note, "<HI>Mr. Holker begs the proper entries may be made</HI>". In a letter from you of the 7th of January 1779, you a&s;k,
<Q>When will Mr. Robert Morris be at liberty to work with Mr. Holker on account of the expenditures of the fleet, <HI>his negociations,</HI> and at Bo&s;ton.</Q>
You wrote to me on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t 1779, as follows,
<Q>Mr. Holker pre|&s;ents his compliments to Mr. Morris, reflecting on Mr. Chaumont's prote&s;ting the bills, he makes the following reque&s;ts: That his account may be finally drawn out and &s;ent to him, that a proper li&s;t of loan-office certificates, proceeding from the bills drawn on Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont, payable at the hou&s;e of Mr. Peltier, may be finally drawn up and tran&s;mitted, after having been certified by me par quadruplicates, &s;o as he may di&s;po&s;e of part or the whole thereof. That an account of the money paid into Mr. Bell's hands, by Mr. Jonathan Williams, for the account of Mr. Chaumont, may be made out, and the price of exchange, then current, mentioned; &s;o as to au|thori&s;e me to &s;end notes of the payment to the Mini&s;ter, to pay the value thereof to Mr. Chaumont on account of the affairs of the Royal Marine, to determine the Mini&s;ter to honor my bills, to facilitate Chaumont's affairs, to give &s;ome &s;atisfaction, to en&s;ure my own credit and con&s;equence, &amp;c. &amp;c. I &s;hould want &s;even half joes, which I &s;hall reimplace here on the fir&s;t opportunity. I am yours for life and death, HOLKER,</Q>
In your letter of the &s;ixteenth of Augu&s;t, 1779, you &s;ay,
<Q>I beg you'll write in a pre&s;&s;ing manner to Mr. Smith for his accounts, &s;o as I may have, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, an e&s;timate of <HI>our</HI> &s;ituation with re&s;pect to the King.</Q>
On the twenty-fifth of the &s;ame month you &s;ay,
<Q>Mr. Holker hopes Mr. Smith has &s;ent his accounts, they are very nece&s;&s;ary, as Mr. Holker can only ground his remittance to Mr. Chaumont on the general account.</Q>
On the third of September you &s;ay,
<Q>The above note is a general account of what was furni&s;hed by the Continental commi&s;&s;aries in Bo&s;ton, de|ducting the article mentioned in Miller and Tracey's account. Remainder, is that part, which, being &s;ent from hence, arrived in Bo&s;ton, and mu&s;t be e&s;timated at the price then current in Bo&s;ton, according to Me&s;&s;rs. Miller and Tracey's account, &s;o as to avoid all difficulties.</Q>
And on the eighth of September, 1779, you &s;ay,
<Q>As &s;oon as you can &s;end me a copy of the general account, I &s;hall be glad to receive it, &s;o as to ground my letter to the Mi|ni&s;ter, by Mr. Gerard, and my corre&s;pondence with Mr. de Chaumont.</Q>
All this was previous to the <HI>&s;ettlement</HI> of tho&s;e accounts on the 9th of September, 1779.</P>
<P>But, Sir, it will not be difficult to &s;hew, not only what you ordered and agreed to, but even what you <HI>intended</HI> at that time; altho' your intentions may now have changed. Be plea&s;ed to recollect, that your operations at Bo&s;ton were twofold, part for the King, and part for private account; that the bu&s;ine&s;s of both kinds pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ome in|&s;tances thro' the &s;ame hands, and that the money was applied partly by funds, which you received there, and partly by bills drawn on me. John Rowe's accounts amount, in the whole, to the &s;um (in Penn&s;ylvania currency)

<P>The&s;e were part of the funds applied to the King's &s;ervice, al&s;o about &pound;.2000, of what you received for goods of Mr. Chaumont, and a very con&s;iderable &s;um belonging to the &s;ame gentleman, which was received by Jonathan Williams in Bo&s;ton. This la&s;t, paid to the u&s;e of the Royal marine &pound;.187,525 - 5 - 10, and he received the money from &s;ales of bills on Mr. Chaumont, Mr. Grand, Me&s;&s;rs. Lecouteulx &amp; Co. and from &s;ales of goods, the property of Mr. Chaumont, Chaumont Cavillon freres &amp; Co. Sabatier fils &amp; De&s;pres, and Marquis de St. Aignan. <HI>The accounts of all the&s;e things are, at your de&s;ire, in my books and in my name.</HI> How are they to be &s;eparated? Where are your in&s;tructions for the purpo&s;e at the time? Could you have had any &s;uch thing then in idea? But you have endeavoured to obviate the&s;e clear conclu&s;ions, by holding up the idea, that the &s;ettlement before Mr. Gerard was a very incomplete &s;tatement, which it was nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>him</HI> to have before his departure for France. Is there any thing in your notes or letters, written at the time, which will countenance &s;uch con&s;truction? You know that there is not; you know that they prove the direct contrary. And, I'll go one &s;tep farther, which is to &s;how, that very long after Mr. Gerard's departure you viewed that &s;ettlement in a very different point of light. For, I have a note, in which you &s;ay,
<Q>Mr. Holker wants a copy of Mr. Robert Morris's <HI>old account current of the Royal Marine &s;igned by Mr. Gerard,</HI> which he will return immediately, and then will demand a meeting with Mr. Morris, for his kind advice, how to proceed in a &s;ettlement with Roger Sherman.</Q>
It is clear, therefore, that before your <HI>Bo&s;ton operations,</HI> at the time of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>when the account of them was rendered,</HI> and <HI>long after,</HI> you <HI>agreed, con&s;ented, ordered,</HI> and <HI>intended</HI> that they &s;hould be involved in my accounts. The effort now made to &s;eparate them is with a view to e&s;tabli&s;h your demand of depreciation. But, altho' it is in that re&s;pect immaterial to me, I will not con&s;ent to it.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned that I de&s;ired you to write on this &s;ubject, that I might have an opportunity, once for all, to conte&s;t it. I will add, that I did not imagine you would &s;eriou&s;ly advance &s;uch a claim. Remember, Sir,
<PB N="14" REF="044903_0015_101F4F111A202FC8">
that my tran&s;actious with you, were merely of the nature of a tru&s;t; you put monies into my hands <HI>for your own pur|po&s;es</HI>; I held them <HI>at your di&s;po&s;ition</HI>; if I performed that tru&s;t, and the monies peri&s;hed in my hands, how am I an|&s;werable? Did I ever a&s;k you to place monies in my hands (except when you indicated purcha&s;es to be made or &s;er|vices to be performed that required it? You know that I did not. Did I ever refu&s;e to honor your drafts, or obey your orders on me for money? You know that I did not. To what purpo&s;e, then, is it, that you &s;peak to me of the depreciation of monies which I did you the favor to keep for you? I &s;ay favor, becau&s;e the lo&s;s in receiving and paying &s;uch large nominal &s;ums in paper money, by errors in counting&punc; &amp;c. amount to more than you can have any idea of, and the trouble and time con&s;umed therein, none can know, but tho&s;e who went through the painful experience. Suppo&s;e you had entru&s;ted to me any other peri&s;hable article, &s;hould I, or could I be made an&s;werable for the wa&s;te and lo&s;s while it lay in my &s;tore, e&s;pecially if I received no con&s;ideration for the care and cu&s;tody? Altho', to oblige you, the&s;e accounts were rendered in a variegated form, they might all be comprized under one general account, between you and me, of monies received and paid by me. Whether, during the whole of this time, there was, or was not, a balance in my hands, is totally immaterial to me; it was always ready at your order to draw it out when you plea&s;ed. I repeatedly, at your de&s;ire, made e&s;timates for your government in this re&s;pect, and my books and papers were always open to you. Thus much, Sir, I have thought it might be proper to &s;ay on the general principle.</P>
<P>For what you &s;ay, in your letter of the 23d of January, on the &s;ubject of dates to the articles of my accounts, I can only refer you to the &s;ubordinate accounts, which contain dates as preci&s;ely as I can render them (except that the articles of my ca&s;h account being only entered from the ca&s;h-book into the wa&s;te-book weekly, probably the dates may &s;ometimes bear the date of the day of entry, in&s;tead of the preci&s;e day on which the money was paid or received; but this, I conceive, is not of any importance.) But, in your &s;ame letter, you &s;ay further,
<Q>In the private accounts your tran&s;actions being blended with mine, the accounts of various other individuals being al&s;o blended with mine and yours, it is impo&s;&s;ible to know, from the dates that appear on them, what is the right of each individual.</Q>
Believe me, Sir, I have no de&s;ire to preclude you from any calculations you may think proper, on this occa&s;ion; but, I will neither a&s;k of others, nor allow my&s;elf any depreciation in the monies which were held for your u&s;e and at your di&s;po&s;ition. For in&s;tance, when, by your de&s;ire, I remitted upwards of thirty thou&s;and pounds to Mr. Slough, to purcha&s;e flour for the Royal Marine and money of the recalled emi&s;&s;ions for your private friends, can you believe I would expo&s;e my reputation, by a&s;king him for the depreciation of that money, or wa&s;te my fortune, by allowing it to you? But, you a&s;k me, in your letter of the twenty-third of January, Why offer a certificate that you would not allow depreciation? Recollect, I pray you, that this was in an&s;wer to your que&s;tion, what you &s;hould &s;ay to the King's Mini&s;ter for not allowing it to him. You &s;ay further,
<Q>Let the advantages gained by your operations, be placed again&s;t the lo&s;&s;es &s;uffered by depreciation; this is fair and ju&s;t; <HI>this is all you certainly can mean or pretend to.</HI></Q>
But, I neither mean nor pretend to any &s;uch a thing, I have already &s;aid, and again repeat, I a&s;k no credit of the King for any &s;avings, I am not accountable to him for any loo&s;ings, nor will I compen&s;ate to him or to you for any depreciation during my agency in your affairs. At the &s;ame time it is not clear to me that you would not have to pay, rather than receive on the King's account; for, at the time when the &s;ettlement was made before Mr. Gerard I was actually in advance, altho', from the face of the account, the balance is con&s;iderably again&s;t me. The notes made on that very account &s;hew this, and, altho' tho&s;e notes were then made upon e&s;timates only, yet the facts &s;upport them; except, that the &s;um in the hands of Mr. Smith was not quite &s;o large as we expected, a con&s;iderable part thereof being applied to purcha&s;e and fitting a &s;hip for your and my ac|count,
<PB N="15" REF="044903_0016_101F4F1B34ADCB48">
came from our own funds, and of cour&s;e le&s;&s;ened the &s;um Mr. Smith had for the &s;ervice of the Royal Marine. In like manner, the remittance of &pound;.10,000 had not been effectually made to Mr. Langdon, but he had, by your de&s;ire, received my orders long before to purcha&s;e the ma&s;ts which were e&s;timated at that &s;um, and I was liable to pay his drafts whenever they &s;hould appear. But, in your letter of the twenty-third of January, you a&s;k me,
<Q>Why argue, that becau&s;e the King had made great &s;avings by the operations of the Royal Marine <HI>under my direction,</HI> you are not to account <HI>to me</HI> on his behalf and make good depreciation if any lo&s;s en&s;ued.</Q>
Indeed, Sir, I made u&s;e of no &s;uch argument, but told you the King had not &s;uffered by depreciation, and therefore had no right to a&s;k it. You certainly can not have forgotten the arguments which you have u&s;ed for paying the United States for pro|vi&s;ions furni&s;hed at the nominal value, viz. that the King's money lay in the hands of your agents, at your order, ready to pay into the trea&s;ury, and as you could not a&s;k them to make good depreciation, &s;o it ought not to be a&s;ked of you. I have &s;aid that I did not a&s;k you to place money in my hands; I now go further, if I had been in your place, <HI>I would not have drawn for the King's money until it was wanted for the King's &s;ervice.</HI> Doubtle&s;s you had good rea&s;ons for writing to me on the twenty-&s;ixth of February 1779,
<Q>Mr. Holker pre&s;ents his compliments to Mr. Robert Morris, and begs he will do his utmo&s;t to pu&s;h on his accounts as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, as al&s;o the negociation of bills, &s;o as to make money.</Q>
And &s;hall Mr. Holker now a&s;k this &s;ame Mr. Morris for depreciation, for money thus brought into his hands? Nay, money that lay ready for his di&s;po&s;al, and which Mr. Morris could not have parted with without immiment hazard? On the twenty-eighth day of April, 1779, you &s;ay,
<Q>I &s;hall want, for the u&s;e of the Royal Navy of France, from <HI>fourteen to fifteen thou&s;and barrels of flour.</HI> I beg, al&s;o, that you'll lay in here, <HI>five hundred barrels of the be&s;t beef, and as much pork.</HI></Q>
On the twentieth of Augu&s;t, 1779, you &s;ay,
<Q>What money can you command in Bo&s;ton, &s;hall I offer it to the trea&s;ury, or &s;hall I have it employed in the pur|cha&s;e of beef, pork, codfi&s;h, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q>
On the third of September, 1779,
<Q>Mr. Gerard wants 10,000 dollars for a few days. Mr. Holker has taken the liberty of drawing this day on Mr. Morris for that &s;um.</Q>
On the eighteenth of the &s;ame month,
<Q>I reque&s;t you'll be &s;o kind as to write to Mr. Mumford in Connecticut, to &s;ecure the &s;alt provi&s;ions, flour, bread, &amp;c. but e&s;pecially the oil, and butter, and &s;alt-fi&s;h, that might come in any prize ve&s;&s;els, to be &s;old at Providence or New-London.</Q>
Can you &s;eriou&s;ly imagine, that the depo&s;itary of monies, held liable to &s;udden calls, of any and every kind, and who was always ready to an&s;wer tho&s;e calls, would be &s;o weak as to allow for the peri&s;hing of it in his hands? Can you &s;uppo&s;e any tribunal, or any impartial per&s;on, would hold him bound to make it good? But let us return for a moment to your Bo&s;ton tran&s;actions, on which &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s is laid. Your mo&s;t favorable &s;tatement of them can only be, <HI>a profit made by the King on the depreciation of money belonging to individuals, applied to his u&s;e.</HI> But this is not all: you, as I have already ob&s;erved, derived the means of making tho&s;e expenditures, principally from funds credited to individuals in accounts kept by you, in my name, at your reque&s;t; compri&s;e the whole together, and you mu&s;t &s;ee, that it forms neither addition to, nor deduction from, what I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. But, according to the mode in which you &s;eem to de&s;ire a &s;tatement, I &s;hould fir&s;t account to tho&s;e individuals for depreciation on monies you received and applied to the King's u&s;e; &s;econdly, to the King, for monies which you put into my hands; and, thirdly, you would a&s;k the United States to accept of the money at the original value, becau&s;e it had been in my hands; this attempt requires no comment. Such, then, is your claim for depreciation on general principles, and on the particular nature of our accounts. Before I quit the &s;ubject I will &s;elect two or three in&s;tances from tho&s;e accounts, which will bring the rea&s;oning more home to your perceptions. The King paid 400,000 <HI>Livres</HI> for two prizes, taken by the privateers Hancock and Bo&s;ton, you agreed with the owners for &pound;.70,000 lawful money; you paid in part your bills for 45,000 <HI>Livres,</HI> (&pound;.7875) and drew on me for
<PB N="16" REF="044903_0017_101F4F1CCEA0A100">
the remainder &pound;.62,125, which &s;ums together, make &pound;.70,000 lawful. The&s;e drafts on me, equal to &pound;.77,656 - 5 Penn&s;ylvania currency, were paid by me, when your public bills were &s;elling at 900 per cent. on &s;terling, reckoning livres 10&frac12; d. &s;terling. Con&s;equently, tho&s;e bills were paid with &s;omewhat le&s;s than 200,000 <HI>Livres,</HI> the difference on the whole tran&s;action was a gain of 155,000 <HI>Livres Tournois.</HI></P>
<P>The account &s;ales of bills of exchange, dated the eleventh of March, 1779, contains a &s;ale to Peter White&s;ide of 91,428 <HI>Livres</HI> 5 <HI>&s;ols,</HI> of which one bill for 4571 <HI>Livres</HI> 7 <HI>&s;ols,</HI> was on his account. The remainder (equal to &pound;.3800 &s;terling) was, on your and my joint account, taken at the current rate, towards reducing the advances which had been made for the Royal Marine, and afterwards I agreed to give you the &s;um of &pound;.5700 advance on your half, for which you are credited the 12th of May in your account current, being a profit you gained thereon. The fifteenth of February, 1780, I received by your orders, bills to the amount of 54,722 <HI>Livres</HI> 18 <HI>&s;ols,</HI> which were, according to that order, received of Me&s;&s;rs. Wm. Turnbull and Co. whom I have credited for the &s;ame, at the then current price of &s;ix dollars per <HI>livre</HI>; afterwards 36752 <HI>Livres</HI> 6 <HI>&s;ols</HI> of the&s;e bills were paid for a brigantine, in which you and I were concerned, and 5500 <HI>Livres</HI> were &s;old at one dollar advance, is Dollrs. 5500 and 12651 <HI>Livres</HI> at three dollars advance, is 37953 Dollrs. 43453</P>
<P>For one half of this gain you are credited by me in account current on the &s;eventh of April, 1780, and yet you can a&s;k me for depreciation on the&s;e accounts. You have a&s;ked me for <HI>Livres</HI>&mdash;which you &s;uppo&s;e to be due, and by examining the la&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions, being one of tho&s;e on which this demand is made, you will find I &s;hould in that ca&s;e pay &pound;. 4104 - 3 - 7 for what &s;old at the time for &pound;. 2600&mdash;and in a tran&s;action where you had already derived the benefit of the actual depreciation.</P>
<P>You wi&s;h to know what mea&s;ures I allude to which may prove di&s;advantageous or even ruinous to you, and what are the fal&s;e conclu&s;ions drawn by you. I believe, Sir, you will be convinced that the conclu&s;ions you had formed of me and my conduct are not ju&s;t; if you &s;till think otherwi&s;e, go on in the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to compel me to ren|der &s;uch accounts as you like. Whether &s;ome of the facts contained in this letter would be to your advantage or di&s;advantage and whether they would promote your grandeur or effect your ruin, you be&s;t can determine. Having thus di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the points &s;o much laboured and in&s;i&s;ted upon in your late letters, I come now to &s;peak of the accounts &s;ent you herewith.</P>
<P>In your letter of the 24th January you &s;ay "I told you that Mr. Swanwick had delivered to Mr. Turnbull the ac|counts of the Royal Marine after my peru&s;al <HI>and examination of &s;aid accounts</HI>: in this you are mi&s;taken; I might have looked at them cur&s;orily, but as to examining them I never did until &s;ince the twenty third day of January, the day on which you and I had our la&s;t interview. I am &s;orry to &s;ay that, upon my examination of tho&s;e accounts, I find Mr. Swanwick had made con&s;iderable errors and omi&s;&s;ions, all which I have now corrected: and as you did forbid Mr. Turnbull to admit the balances of my accounts to be introduced into his, (although I could prove your contrary orders at the time if I thought it nece&s;&s;ary) I have continued the account of the Royal Marine in your name as agent until the end thereof. By this account you will find there was a balance of upwards of &pound;. 340,000 continental cur|rency in my favor when I cea&s;ed to be your agent: this con&s;i&s;ts with e&s;timates which you and I made at that time and with the letters you told me you then wrote, excepting as to &pound;. 100,000 which I &s;hall pre&s;ently mention. This balance was nearly di&s;charged by bills of exchange which by your order I received of M&s;&s;rs. William Turnbull &amp; Co. in March, April and June 1780, and which I &s;old or paid at the &s;ame price I was charged for them, to John Donald|&s;on,
<PB N="17" REF="044903_0018_101F4F2259600860">
I&s;aac Mo&s;es and others, to all which you was privy at the time. It is true that I had charged Wm. Turnbull and Co. with the effects from which their capital was to be drawn, and that I had omitted in due time to give them credit for the &s;um of &pound;.200,000 continental currency, being the amount of that capital, which you and I agreed to advance to Mr. Turnbull, when we took him into partner&s;hip, in order to transfer your agency into his hands, neither had I charged your account for &pound;.100,000 continental, being the half of that capital, &s;o that the&s;e omi&s;&s;ions not being at|tended to in our e&s;timates, generally occa&s;ioned an error in them of &pound;. 100,000 continental currency, as is above men|tioned. Notwith&s;tanding this I find, that on &s;tating properly the accounts between M&s;&s;rs. Wm. Turnbull &amp; Co. and me, they were paid for all the bills of exchange which I purcha&s;ed of them, &s;o that you will find your claim of 169,000 <HI>Livres</HI> Tournois falls to the ground. From the time I cea&s;ed to be your agent our accounts are no longer to be con|&s;idered as of the nature of a tru&s;t, neither are the accounts between Wm. Turnbull &amp; Co. and me of that nature. I am willing therefore to &s;ettle my accounts with them and tho&s;e with you for &s;ub&s;equent tran&s;actions upon principles of depreciation. I find, that at the time when the Royal Marine owed me upwards of three hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds continental currency, I had in my hands, of your private funds, and tho&s;e of your friends, nearly to the amount of three hundred thou&s;and pounds continental, and as I continued to receive more after that period, I readily agree to &s;et a&s;ide Mr. Swanwick's propo&s;ition, of valuing the balance of continental money on your private account current at one hundred for one; he meant to do ju&s;tice between us, but it did not occur to him that I received on account of the balance in my favor, on your account, as agent of the Royal Marine, the &s;um of &pound;. 342,775 - 2 - 6 conti|nental money, when it was worth &s;ixty-one and a half for one; and, that having at the &s;ame time near &pound;. 300,000 of yours and your friends in my hands, you ought to have the like value for at lea&s;t the latter amount. And therefore to &s;ave all trouble of inve&s;tigation, as to the exact &s;um which was in my hands, I agree to compute the &s;ame &s;um which I received &pound;. 342,775 - 2 - 6 continental, at &s;ixty-one and a half, and bring the amount thereof to your credit in the hard money account; this I think is ju&s;t, and therefore, Sir, I offer it. There will then remain a balance of &pound;. 114,561 - 18 - 0 &frac12; continental money ari&s;ing from receipts of later date, the value of which mu&s;t be &s;ettled by you and me. You will ob&s;erve, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;everal articles in the accounts now rendered, which Mr. Swan|wick had omitted &s;ome for, and &s;ome again&s;t you. In the cour&s;e of examining my books and papers I have di&s;covered al&s;o, that I lent you a cargo of tobacco, which was &s;hipped for your account in May, 1780, per the brig Hawke, Captain Taylor, from Baltimore, con&s;i&s;ting of 79 hog&s;heads. This tobacco I borrowed and paid in November la&s;t, without recollecting its being lent to you; therefore, you mu&s;t either return me &s;eventy-nine hog&s;heads of tobacco, or pay me as much money as will purcha&s;e it. I am ready to meet you at any time and place, in order to fix the value of the continental balance above mentioned, as al&s;o the price of the tobacco; unle&s;s you chu&s;e to &s;ave that trouble, by delivering the like quantity of tobacco equally good in quality, which will be mo&s;t agreeable to me; when the&s;e two points are adju&s;ted, there can be no difficulty in completing the &s;ettlement of our accounts. I will then render you an account of tho&s;e articles depending between us, which con&s;i&s;ts of hard money debits and credits. I have formerly rendered you a number of tho&s;e &s;ubordinate accounts, who&s;e amount or balance form articles in the accounts currt. now &s;ent, I did intend to have had the whole copied again and &s;ent with the&s;e, but as this would detain you much longer from the inve&s;tigation of your real &s;ituation with me, I have omitted it for the pre&s;ent; but I will cheerfully have copied and &s;ent to you any of them that you may de&s;ire. I am al&s;o not only ready but de&s;irous to explain any thing in the&s;e accounts that you do not comprehend; for, altho' I will not comply with unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable demands, yet I am, and ever &s;hall be, ready to &s;hew all tho&s;e with whom I have any dealings, that the accounts, which I ren|der, are ju&s;t, fair and honorable.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="044903_0019_101F4F258E4050C0">You will probably think it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould have &s;ent my vouchers in &s;upport of the&s;e accounts; but, &s;ince you have detained from me &s;ome of tho&s;e which were confidentially entru&s;ted to you, I will not part with tho&s;e which now remain, until we &s;hall have made a &s;ettlement. It is po&s;&s;ible, &s;ituated as I am, &s;ubject to perpetual interruptions, that there may &s;till be errors or omi&s;&s;ions in the&s;e accounts, altho' I have examined them with all the care and attention that I could; if any &s;uch, they cannot be important nor long undi&s;covered, as I &s;hall &s;till be&s;tow time on the &s;ubordinate accounts more than I have yet done. If either errors or omi&s;&s;ions are di&s;covered, whether they make for or again&s;t me, I &s;hall announce them to you, in order that right may be done.</P>

<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations on ROBERT MORRIS's letter of the 26th of February, 1784, to JOHN HOLKER, and extracts from the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>ROBERT MORRIS, being accu&s;ed with delaying the &s;ettlement of his accounts with JOHN HOLKER, appears determined to acquit him&s;elf of that charge. With this view, he &s;ends, with the letter above men|tioned (of February 26, 1784,) his accounts, for a final &s;ettlement, which, according to his &s;tatement, nearly balance by credit and debit. He then, in his turn, accu&s;es the agent general, J. H. of having unju&s;tly charged him with &s;uch delays, and of attributing them to a wi&s;h of withholding a balance due to J. H. This point is to be cleared up by the accounts of the auditors, which, however, cannot materially differ, at lea&s;t in <HI>nominal</HI> &s;ums of continental money, from tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed by J. H. again&s;t R. M. upon the vouchers produced by the latter.</P>
<P>Speaking of the nature of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, during his agency, R. M. &s;ays,
<Q>You may remember al&s;o, that you urged it as a kind of obligation, to take care of the intere&s;ts of a King, who was in the act of af|fording &s;uch generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance to my country, and called on me, if I would not act my&s;elf, to point out &s;ome other per&s;on.</Q>
And <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this &s;aid letter R. M. fir&s;t &s;ays,
<Q>You will remember, Sir, that <HI>you introduced your&s;elf to my acquaintance</HI> in the beginning of July, 1778, and <HI>pre&s;&s;ed me</HI> to undertake the tran&s;action of your affairs. The <HI>con&s;ideration,</HI> held out to me, was, that very <HI>great</HI> &s;ums of money would naturally come to my hands, and might be occa&s;ionally employed in u&s;eful &s;peculations on our joint account.</Q>
J. H. &s;ays he never pre&s;&s;ed R. M. to undertake his affairs; he offered to R. M. the preference of his affairs; he &s;tipulated a fixed commi&s;&s;ion; but denies that ever he held out as a con&s;idera|tion, that they were jointly to &s;peculate with the funds of any one; much le&s;s to &s;peculate and attempt the ruin of the &s;er|vice and of his ab&s;ent friends, by working depreciation again&s;t them. No one at lea&s;t will believe that the con&s;idera|tion held out to R. M. was, that R. M. &s;hould &s;peculate with J. H's money for his own account, and afterwards that J. H. &s;hould gladly put up with a nominal account, when it plea&s;ed R. M. to render any, or to offer a &s;ettlement of them. But every one will &s;ee why and wherefore he accepted of the preference given him to manage J. H's affairs; and others will be&s;t judge, whether it is true that R. M's con&s;ent was <HI>reluctantly drawn from him,</HI> on this occa&s;ion, by a man who had <HI>introduced him&s;elf</HI> to his acquaintance.</NOTE> further &s;ays,
<Q>At length you drew from me my reluctant con&s;ent. And whatever el&s;e may happen, I have, at lea&s;t, the plea&s;ure to reflect, that the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me was faithfully executed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="044903_0020_101F4F284AB13E60">By this paragraph, he &s;ays, he reflects with plea&s;ure, that he has faithfully executed the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, tho' he did undertake the King's bu&s;ine&s;s with reluctance; he was &s;olicited thereto by the King's agent, who urged him to act for the intere&s;t of a good and generous King, and &s;tipulated with him, as a previous obligation, that he &s;hould take care of his intere&s;t; becau&s;e he was in the act of giving and affording a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his country in the hour of it's di&s;tre&s;s; he engaged in the King's concerns, and to act in tho&s;e of Holker's friends on this footing. But, RES MIRABILIS? he afterwards maintains he was not <HI>agent,</HI> not bailiff in law,&mdash;but merely a <HI>banker,</HI> all the time of his agency.</P>
<P>And further,
<Q>As you was not only agent for your &s;overeign, but al&s;o for many individuals trading to this coun|try, or &s;peculating in our public funds, the concerns, <HI>which I engaged in for you,</HI> were both numerous and important.</Q></P>
<P>In another part of this letter he &s;ays, page 9,
<Q>Remember, Sir, that my tran&s;actions with you were merely of the nature of a tru&s;t, you put <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">R. M. is plea&s;ed to call <HI>bills of exchange</HI> by the deno|mination of <HI>monies,</HI> in order thereby to draw a con&s;equence, favorable to his purpo&s;es.</NOTE> monies into my hands for your own purpo&s;es, <HI>I held them at your di&s;po&s;ition</HI>; if I per|formed that tru&s;t, and the monies peri&s;hed in my hands, how am I an&s;werable. Did I ever a&s;k you to place monies into my hands, except when you indicated purcha&s;es, or &s;ervices to be performed? Did I ever refu&s;e to honor your drafts, or obey your orders on me for money? To what purpo&s;e then is it that you &s;peak to me of depreciation of monies which I did you the favor to keep for you? I &s;ay favor, becau&s;e the lo&s;s in receiving and paying &s;uch large nominal &s;ums of paper money, by errors <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Is the mi&s;take in counting money always on one &s;ide?</NOTE> in counting, amount to more than you have an idea of, and the trouble and time con&s;umed therein, none can know, but tho&s;e who went through the painful experience.</Q></P>
<P>John Holker entru&s;ted to Robert Morris almo&s;t the whole of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Royal Marine, deeming him alone competent thereto; J. H. being a foreigner, unacquainted with accounts and with the characters to be cho&s;en and employed&mdash;with the prices of articles,&mdash;with the countries where the&s;e articles or provi&s;ions were to be procured,&mdash;with the nature of the money then current,&mdash;and the valuations of &s;pecie through the continent: he had no clerk, no accountant with him, no credit e&s;tabli&s;hed to tran&s;act or give &s;atisfaction in tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s, to &s;ecure engagements, &amp;c. &amp;c. For all the&s;e purpo&s;es R. M. was cho&s;en and employed, and at the time J. H. had not another choice to make.</P>
<P>For the&s;e purpo&s;es, he gave bills of exchange, he put bills on France into the hands of R. M. and al&s;o &s;ome monies ari&s;ing from the &s;ales of prize goods and others, &s;alt, &amp;c. &amp;c. However, all this, R. M. &s;ays, was reduced to a mere tru&s;t of monies depo&s;ited with him, which he did J. H. the favor to keep; this favor, however, was to co&s;t an immen&s;e &s;um to the King; for, laying a&s;ide all con&s;iderations re&s;pecting the heavy lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained on &s;uch of the bills, as it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ell for the real purpo&s;e of &s;ervices actually performed for the Royal Marine, it appears by the account, that a &s;um exceeding &pound;.39,000 of real &s;pecie value, of which &pound;.30,000 at lea&s;t were paid in bills on France, are &s;aid to have been employed by R. M. in order to make purcha&s;es of articles or payments, which together amount to no more than &pound;.11,950 - 8 - 11&frac12; &s;pecie value, thus &s;inking &pound;.39,000 real, in order to pay about &pound;.12,000. A pretty favor indeed!</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;e," continues the author of this extraordinary letter,
<Q>you had entru&s;ted me with any other peri&s;hable <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">R.

<Q>As to my&s;elf I claim from the King neither thanks, nor honors, nor rewards.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">But he claimed from the King's agent five per cent. for his commi&s;&s;ions on all purcha&s;es on the King's account, two and a half per cent. on the &s;ales of all bills, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is true, he was, per agreement, to allow one half of the&s;e com|mi&s;&s;ions to the King's agent, and this half has been prudent|ly &s;aved for the King; therefore, the auditors can only credit R.

M. on account of the exten&s;ive bu&s;ine&s;s he had to manage, agreed originally, to be &s;atisfied with one half of the commi&s;&s;ions u&s;ually charged in America, which are more than double of what is u&s;ually charged by European merchants on commi&s;&s;ion bu&s;ine&s;s.</NOTE> I &s;hall never give my&s;elf a <HI>moment's concern,</HI> whether he <HI>gained</HI> or <HI>lo&s;t,</HI> on tho&s;e tran&s;actions which <HI>I</HI> performed by your order: I owed him <HI>no duty,</HI> he had confided to me <HI>no tru&s;t,</HI> nor conferred on me any authority, <HI>if</HI> he had, I &s;hould have executed his <HI>tru&s;t with fidelity:</HI> you are re&s;pon&s;ible to him, and may render &s;uch accounts as you think proper, mine with you, I &s;end with this letter.</Q></P>
<P>If the King had conferred on R. M. authority, he then would have acted with fidelity; but when the King's agent confers on him all his authority, then he is not bound to any duty; he may act without integrity in this ca&s;e, and even charge therewith his employer, and traduce the agent general, becau&s;e he repo&s;ed confidence in his good faith, hone&s;ty, reputation and fidelity; he was not then re&s;pon&s;ible for the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, becau&s;e no commi&s;|&s;ion in his name had i&s;&s;ued under the King's authority, except merely for the accounts of the nominal value of the&s;e peri&s;hable articles, which he had purcha&s;ed with <HI>unperi&s;hable</HI> bills; and the&s;e he had procured from the King's agent, under the pretence of fallacious accounts, of real expenditures, actual advances of money, and further wants for further expenditures. Suppo&s;e he had received from the agent general 100 hog&s;heads full of mola&s;&s;es, that he was to keep them in his &s;tore, and attend carefully to the wa&s;te; he accounts for the hog&s;heads but not for the contents; and when called upon to open the &s;tore, and to prove by his cooper, and &s;ervants, and books, that the hog&s;heads were attended to, that they have been con&s;tantly in &s;tore, and that he has neither &s;old nor bartered the contents; he then maintains, that the King had conferred on him no authority; therefore that he would neither open his &s;tore, thereby

to prove the natural leakage and wa&s;te of the hog&s;heads; nor would produce his books, not being bound to act with fidelity or integrity, becau&s;e he was only employed by the King's agent, and not by the King&mdash;becau&s;e he was not agent for the latter, but only a &s;tore keeper, a banker for J.

<P>The following pa&s;&s;age will &s;hew that he received more, or pretended to receive more, than the full con&s;ideration for his &s;ervices as bailiff and agent; and therefore much more than he could have claimed, had he been, as he &s;ays, a mere depo&s;itary, a mere banker.</P>

<Q>The fact <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is in reply to J. H's letters of the 23d and 24th of January, 1784 who &s;aid, that the <HI>accounts</HI> relative to Bo&s;ton tran&s;actions, re&s;pecting the <HI>fleet of</HI> Count D'E&s;taing, ought not and &s;hould not be blended with R M's accounts of his agency; becau&s;e improper con&s;equences would and did appear from their introduction into R. M's accounts. For J. H. had then di&s;covered, that it was by their means that R. M. contrived to conceal the real &s;ituation of his accounts and operations from him, and to make a claim of bills on France to an im|men&s;e amount, on account of balances erroncou&s;ly brought by R.

<Q>were due to me</Q>
&s;ay, to R. M.</NOTE> was that the account of your Bo&s;ton tran&s;actions, as well as all others of the&s;e accounts, was in&s;erted in mine by your order, that the whole might appear in one point of view, and a commi&s;&s;ion be charged on the whole.</Q></P>
<P>In this bu&s;ine&s;s, J. H. did not even benefit of the advice of R. M. during all the time of his re&s;idence in Bo&s;ton: in October, November and December 1778. But as he pray'd R. M. to redact tho&s;e accounts on his return to Philadelphia, he at the time con&s;ented to allow a commi&s;&s;ion of 2&frac12; per cent. on the whole, on a &s;um of more than &pound;.305,000, when it ought only to have extended to the &s;um of &pound;.51,503, paid by him for J. Rowe's drafts from Bo&s;ton, and J. H's bills on him for &pound;.54,981 - 11- 3, continental currency: one half of this commi&s;&s;ion was, however, to have been credited to the Royal Marine, and this reduces the claim of R. M. on the whole to one and one quarter per cent. or one half of the above commi&s;&s;ion, if the claim is admi&s;&s;ible on the improper con&s;ent of the agent general given at the time, to the propo&s;al of R. M. for his trouble in redacting the accounts.</P>
<P>R. M. has &s;aid above, (page 10)
<Q>that if the King had conferred on him any authority, he would have executed his tru&s;t with fidelity:</Q>
afterwards, he adds, (page 15) to his immortal honor
<Q>I did not a&s;k <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">His words are (page 14)
<Q>Did I ever a&s;k you to place monies in my hands, except when you indicated purcha&s;es or &s;ervices to be performed?</Q>

<P>Does not this accu&s;ation made again&s;t J. H.&mdash;does not this charge preferred by R. M. again&s;t his employer&mdash;indi|cate, and amount to an acknowledgement, that R.

M.&mdash;J. H. could not have even &s;u&s;pected that R. M. had ever concealed from his knowledge the management and appropriation of &s;uch a large &s;um as appears by the accounts, nor would he ever have believed it, but from the conviction, that the accounts carry with them, to all who can read and under&s;tand them.</P>
<P>However, the following que&s;tions ari&s;e on this a&s;toni&s;hing pa&s;&s;age of his letter: If it was, in his eyes, a want of

fidelity; if it was not hone&s;t in the King's agent general, to have (as he here a&s;&s;erts) <HI>prematurely drawn the bills</HI>; why does his confidential &s;ubordinate agent <HI>prematurely</HI> &s;ell the&s;e bills? Was it, becau&s;e J. H. had entru&s;ted to him the management of the whole of his bu&s;ine&s;s, the tran&s;action of all his affairs, the negociation of tho&s;e bills, the choice of agents and corre&s;pondents for all purcha&s;es on account of the royal &s;ervice, the &s;ettlement of the accounts? Was it nece&s;&s;ary for R. M. to &s;ell tho&s;e &s;ame bills, before the expenditures in many ca&s;es could have been fore&s;een, much le&s;s have taken place? Were the peri&s;hable proceeds of the bills, &s;o <HI>prematurely &s;old,</HI> to be con&s;idered as ve&s;ted in J. H. or in R. M. to whom the management of this bu&s;ine&s;s was wholly confided?&mdash;Why were tho&s;e <HI>unperi&s;h|able bills,</HI> &s;old for a peri&s;hable article: or rather why pretend a &s;ale to P. White&s;ide, of &pound;.3,800 &s;terling of bills, as he acknowledges to have done, by this very letter, and then keep the whole bills for his own purpo&s;es, in order to account for the peri&s;hable value of their proceeds?&mdash;Was this the execution of that tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, which he &s;ays "It gives me &s;o much plea&s;ure, to have faithfully<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide the &s;econd page of the letter.</NOTE> executed!" And is it thus he was to act for the intere&s;t of a King, who&s;e &s;ervice he had been <HI>urged</HI> by his agent to undertake, becau&s;e he was in the act of affording &s;uch generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his country, and of aiding to &s;ave him from the wrath of an incen&s;ed nation, and a relentle&s;s enemy?</P>
<P>In another part of this letter, R. M. de&s;cribes the nature of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him in conci&s;e terms.&mdash;Page 15.
<Q>Can you &s;eriou&s;ly imagine, (&s;ays he) that the depo&s;itary <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the beginning of this letter he &s;ays,
<Q>The concerns I engaged in for you, were both numerous and important.</Q>
He engaged for J. H. in the concerns of the King, and of J. H's friends&mdash;Was he depo&s;itary of their concerns as well as of their monies, or agent for their concerns and depo&s;itary for their monies, ari&s;ing from, or nece&s;&s;ary for their concerns?</NOTE> of monies, held liable to &s;udden calls of any and every kind, and who was always ready to an&s;wer tho&s;e calls, would be &s;o weak, as to allow for the peri&s;hing <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 14.

<Q>But I will neither a&s;k of others, nor allow my&s;elf any depreciation on the monies which were held for your u&s;e, and at your di&s;po&s;ition.</Q>
If held for J. H's u&s;e in his hands he will not allow depreciation; con|&s;equently, if he did not hold it for his u&s;e, he mu&s;t pay de|preciation, according to his own principle.</NOTE> of it in his hands?</Q></P>
<P>To this it is replied, that among tho&s;e articles be&s;t calculated to rai&s;e money on &s;udden emergencies, and for &s;udden calls of the &s;ervice, bills held the fir&s;t rank among merchants, for the purpo&s;e of an unfailing remittance to Europe: the&s;e would have an&s;wered the purpo&s;e completely at all times, and were not a peri&s;hable article.&mdash;But it is al&s;o to be added, that there never was one &s;udden call made on him for a large &s;um of money during his agency: that all the calls made upon him were the con&s;equence of his own mea&s;ures in almo&s;t every in&s;tance, of the purcha&s;es <HI>he</HI> had directed to be made, of the expenditures <HI>he</HI> had authori&s;ed, as <HI>&s;ubordinate agent,</HI> and not as depo&s;itary or banker.</P>
<P>Indeed it would be rather hard if the monies had come into the hands of R. M. and were to lay with him, till employed, if he &s;old the bills for real purcha&s;es ordered, then actually making, or really practicable, it would be rather hard I &s;ay, to make him account for the untimely &s;ale of bills, and the con&s;equent lo&s;s by depreciation, pro|vided he always had, as he a&s;&s;erts, the money ready in his che&s;t, to an&s;wer &s;udden calls; and that &s;uch money was actually and bona fide peri&s;hing in his hands;&mdash;in &s;uch a ca&s;e, it might be dealing too hard with a banker, or even an agent, to throw on him the whole burthen of the lo&s;s. But if the lo&s;s &s;hould have proved unrea&s;onably great in proportion to the &s;ervice he had rendered, if there &s;hould be rea&s;ons to doubt of the purcha&s;es having been ordered by the agent general to him, when he took the bills, or when he &s;old them to his corre&s;pondents or brokers; then and in this ca&s;e, will it not be incumbent on him to clear up the matter, to &s;hew his books, in order to prove, that, as he &s;ays, the money was actually peri&s;hing in his hands? Shall we take his word, or the declaration of his

friends or partners, or clerks, in his ju&s;tification, when a po&s;itive written evidence, kept on purpo&s;e to e&s;tabli&s;h it, and to ground the opinion of the world on or re&s;pecting his conduct, can be produced by him in his defence?&mdash; Shall not this evidence be produced, &s;ince he acknowledges by this paragraph, "That it would be weak in him to allow for the peri&s;hing of the money in his hands." Which implies a very different con&s;equence, if he employed the money to his own purpo&s;es on the above &s;uppo&s;ition, and reaped not only the wa&s;te of the money, but al&s;o the profits of the &s;peculations he made with the proceeds of the public bills; e&s;pecially when it is evident that he took &s;ome to him&s;elf, under the appearance of fictitious &s;ales; nay, are we not to &s;uppo&s;e that he probably &s;old others &s;o as to employ the proceeds thereof when in his che&s;t, with and without any di&s;tinction from his own monies, as fa&s;t as opportunities offered? This he confe&s;&s;ed in as many words (on the arbitration) to have done, as con&s;tantly as J. H's monies came to his hands, and as any calls whatever were made on him for his own concerns.</P>
<P>Can &s;uch conduct and &s;uch arguments be applauded? Was it thus that R. M. intended to act for the intere&s;t of a generous King in his concerns? Had he forgot that the paper of Congre&s;s was but a nominal <HI>peri&s;hable thing</HI> (to make u&s;e of his own words)? Had he forgot that he alone kept the books; that he had refu&s;ed to open a &s;eparate &s;et of books; that he had in&s;i&s;ted upon blending the accounts of the concerns of J. H. as agent and as a private in|dividual in his own books, with tho&s;e of his own affairs and concerns? He alone was able to know whether the &s;ur|plus monies were employed for the &s;ervice, or peri&s;hing in his che&s;t; it was, therefore, incumbent on him, either to ve&s;t the money, or to have propo&s;ed to his employer to ve&s;t it in &s;ome thing not peri&s;hable, not &s;ubject to depre|ciation, rather than to let it peri&s;h, as he &s;ays, in his hands, if really it was in his hands. Can any one believe, that &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums, 2, 3, or &pound;.400,000, &s;hould have lain for long periods of time, for 6, 8, or 10 months, peri&s;hing in his hands? Was he not to have apprized the King's agent of &s;o very unfortunate a circum&s;tance, &s;o as to have provided again&s;t future wa&s;te or depreciation, if the&s;e had been the unavoidable con&s;equences of the times and cir|cum&s;tances? Had he (R. M.) not fore&s;een, and previou&s;ly intended to apply tho&s;e monies to his own purpo&s;es, and was not this the con&s;ideration he had in view when he reluctantly con&s;ented to tran&s;act J. H's affairs?</P>
<P>R. M. being challenged by the letter of the 23d of January, 1784, of the agent general, with having refu&s;ed to keep &s;eparate books for the public concerns, he an&s;wers:</P>
<P><Q>I do acknowledge that you propo&s;ed my opening a &s;et of books for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Royal Marine; but, upon my objecting that a multiplicity of books <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to this writer, to open a &s;et of books for all public concerns, &s;eparate from all others, would have created confu&s;ion, and given ri&s;e to errors; to <HI>&s;eparate,</HI> according to him, is to confound matters, to &s;ubject an accountant to a greater chance of error; and this was his motive for refu&s;ing to open one more &s;eparate &s;et of books di&s;tinct from his own.</NOTE> were apt to create confu&s;ion and &s;ubjected accountants to a greater chance of error, you acquie&s;ced to the introduction of tho&s;e, as well as the private affairs entru&s;ted to your ma|nagement, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The management of his friends affairs and concerns was entru&s;ted by J.

<P>By refu&s;ing to enter the accounts of the public tran&s;actions in &s;eparate books, in oppo&s;ition to J. H's repeated re|que&s;t, R. M. thus put it out of the power of the King's agent to look into, or to know the &s;ituation of the public affairs, as to the matter of monies on hand: he could not have made out on the books of R. M. the ca&s;h account of the Royal Marine, his own, and that of his friends, without knowing al&s;o the &s;ituation of R. M. as to money in che&s;t; and without being more or le&s;s acquainted with his &s;peculations and affairs, and tho&s;e of his agents and inti|mates. But this could not have been permitted, and thus the agent general was to be kept in the dark. By the&s;e
<PB N="24" REF="044903_0025_101F4F36EFED0EE8">
means did R. M. alone become re&s;pon&s;ible for the con&s;equences of his refu&s;al to accede, at the time, to J. H's pro|po&s;al; which was a proper and nece&s;&s;ary one, and &s;uch as being afterwards made to Me&s;&s;rs. Turnbull <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Their evidence on the trial is to be taken, and to be con|tra&s;ted with the conduct of R. M. and a pretty contra&s;t it will be indeed; for every eulogium, as to truth and candor, is de&s;erved by them, and their accounts give &s;omething of a profit to the King, in&s;tead of the enormous lo&s;s we have to complain of; they were employed for the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, public and private, of J. H. they were reque&s;ted to keep &s;eparate books and a &s;eparate che&s;t, and it was done; they never &s;old a bill but for an expenditure actually made or making; they were confidentially employed, and every tru&s;t was repo&s;ed in them, and they know that they were re&s;pon&s;ible for that tru&s;t, though the King had conferred on them no authority.</NOTE> and Co. was mo&s;t cheerfully complied with. R. M. would not grant this reque&s;t; yet, as J. H. placed the utmo&s;t confidence in his <HI>honor</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> as he conceived that his &s;ervices would be highly u&s;eful to the King, and as the choice of him, for rendering &s;uch &s;ervices, had been made by his Excellency Mr. Gerard, as well as by J. H. he (J. H.) would not <HI>change</HI> his agent for this &s;ole rea&s;on; e&s;pecially as he knew, that this <HI>agent's refu&s;al</HI> of opening &s;eparate books, would render him &s;till more and more re&s;pon&s;ible for all the con&s;equences thereof&mdash;a <HI>refu&s;al</HI> grounded on &s;o weak and frivolous a pretence, &s;o void of truth and rea&s;on. In fact, J. H. objected at the time to the entering of the public accounts on R. M's private books; he objects now to the impropriety of the mea&s;ure, and always thought the refu&s;al, to keep them &s;eparate and di&s;tinct, very improper. J. H. never did freely acquie&s;ce in, but &s;ubmitted to the refu&s;al, becau&s;e R. M. would not do otherwi&s;e; and therefore R. M. is now charged with the con&s;equences thereof, by his employer.</P>
<P>Shall not R. M. be re&s;pon&s;ible, when he alone did know, or could know the amount of the expenditures making, or to be made, and the amount of the bills on France nece&s;&s;ary for defraying tho&s;e expenditures? He alone did and could know the amount of the public monies, or private monies on hand; the management whereof, to &s;ave them from peri&s;hing, to &s;ave the King from lo&s;s, him&s;elf and his friends from ruin, J. H. had entru&s;ted to R. M. to his good faith and attention, to his agency, upon the mo&s;t confidential reliance on his fidelity and abilities, on the &s;ame footing and principles, as the public bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>How much more &s;trong will this rea&s;oning appear; how weak and flim&s;y the excu&s;e offered by R. M. and how glaring his criminal intentions, at the time to keep J. H. his employer, and all others in the dark; when it &s;hall be rendered evident that the e&s;timates made, the accounts given to J. H. as &s;ettled accounts, (though only &s;ettled by R. M. <HI>in his own behalf</HI>) are not exact; that the balances are untrue and fallacious, and all in his favor, all contrived to e&s;tabli&s;h the grounds of obtaining further &s;ums of money, and bills on France, in order to &s;ecure the whole to him&s;elf, to work the plan of depreciation in his defence, and to maintain at a future day, that an immen&s;e property was wa&s;ted thereby in his hands, and had vani&s;hed like &s;now before the &s;un: all this will appear by the accounts to which we refer the reader, and to the ob&s;ervations thereon. Nay, when large nominal &s;ums of the public paper, then &s;aid to be peri&s;hing in his hands, were &s;till to be accounted for, when heavy &s;ums of the &s;ame money, belong|ing to J. H. or his friends, were &s;uppo&s;ed to be in his che&s;t, and were al&s;o to be accounted for; if it &s;hould appear that he was &s;till claiming <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;um of 169,000 <HI>Livres</HI> Tournois, was claimed by R.

<P>Was it not on account of the&s;e terrible con&s;equences, that R.

Was it not through the fear of the&s;e con&s;equences, that he intimates (page 14) that he conceived it was of <HI>no importance</HI> to a&s;certain the preci&s;e dates of receipt and payment of paper money. Was it not through fear of the&s;e con&s;equences that he writes a letter in 16 long and full pages, to prove that J.

<P>Be&s;ides the accounts and the balances of the e&s;timates, which R. M. &s;ays he made at the time, we &s;hall find other proofs of the claims he made for his advances on behalf of the Royal Marine, as early as the 11th of March, 1779. Vide his letter, page 16.</P>
<P><Q>The account &s;ales of bills of exchange, dated the 11th of March, 1779, contains a &s;ale to Peter White&s;ide of 91,428 <HI>Livres</HI> 5 <HI>&s;ols,</HI> of which one bill for 4571 <HI>Livres</HI> 7 <HI>&s;ols</HI> was on his account; the remainder (equal to &pound;.3800 &s;terling) was on your and my joint account taken at the current rate, towards reducing the advances which had been made for the Royal Marine: and afterwards I agreed to give you the &s;um of &pound;.5700 (continental Money) ad|vance on your half, for which you are credited the 12th of May, in your account current, being a profit you gained thereon.</Q>

<P>The fir&s;t object that &s;trikes, in this pa&s;&s;age of the letter, is the &s;ale made to Peter White&s;ide (Peter White&s;ide and Co. was the hou&s;e of R. M. in which he held 3 &s;hares in 4) of bills which belonged to him, as he &s;ays, on account of his actual advances for the Royal Marine, and were taken afterwards for his and J. H's joint account. It will be nece&s;&s;ary that the books of P. White&s;ide be examined, to &s;ee whether any mention is made of this &s;ale, and whether he did not gratuitou&s;ly endor&s;e the&s;e bills to the order of R. M. which mu&s;t have been done to cover the &s;ale, and give room for a charge of a commi&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. This is the more nece&s;&s;ary, in order to ground further minute inve&s;ti|gations of R. M's books, in this and other re&s;pects; and to e&s;tabli&s;h, whethe he was or was not, under the date of the 11th of March, 1779, in advance for the public account, as he now &s;ays, and as he told J. H. at the time. If he was not in advance for the Royal Marine at that period,&mdash;if, on the contrary, he then owed the Royal Marine, or had on hand, more than &pound;.100,000 continental, belonging to the King, did he not deceive J. H. then, and in his letter of the 26th of February, 1784? What &s;hall we believe from him? Does he not owe the&s;e bills, which he confe&s;&s;es having taken, under the cover of a fictitious &s;ale? Has he not taken any more, and how could he &s;ay, that J. H. was in advance for half the &s;um? Was not this al&s;o impo&s;ing on his under&s;tanding? Was it not fur|ther for the purpo&s;e of loading J. H. with depreciation afterwards, on that part of the bills (&s;ays R. M.) taken on his account, that R. M. pre&s;&s;ed J. H. to let him have tho&s;e bills in order to offer the &pound;.5700 continental of <HI>advance,</HI> as expre&s;&s;ed in the accounts under the date of the 12th of May, 1770; and afterwards offered them to J.

Is not this an a&s;toni&s;hing que&s;tion, made in a letter wrote to that very man to whom R. M. refu&s;es all depreciation during his agency, and wherein, al&s;o, he reprobates J. H's claiming depreciation on a tran&s;action where it has been granted by him&s;elf as early as the month of May, 1779? When &s;itting as his own judge, be|twixt J. H. and him&s;elf, R. M. grants the principle of depreciation in May, 1779, by an impul&s;e of his own con|&s;cience, of his own knowledge of right and wrong,&mdash;depreciation for two months, from the 11th of March, 1779, to the 12th of May following,&mdash;and refu&s;es it in 1784 on this very &s;um, and others received by him during the fol|lowing months and years! He reproaches the agent general for claiming it in his own affairs, but much more in the public account; forgetting, we &s;uppo&s;e, that he had got unju&s;tly and without any cau&s;e, the whole &s;um of &pound;.3800 &s;terling, as now appears evident from the vouchers. A great part of the&s;e vouchers were obtained from R. M. when &s;itting on an arbitration, in the month of June, 1784, and not before.</P>
<P>Can we not here &s;ay, and with &s;ome ground, <HI>Quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat?</HI> If it is proved, as it will be, that, he was not in advance on the 11th of March, 1779, is it not clear that R.

In December, 1779, he gives an account to J. H. of his &s;ituation in money, with R. M. and brings J. H. in debt to him &pound;.91,073-18-8, at the very time that he owed J. H. near &pound;.500,000. The&s;e are the nominal accounts, furni&s;hed by him as banker and depo&s;itor.</P>
<P>In 1781, he furni&s;hes the account of the Royal Marine, and brings the King in debt for &pound;.450,000,&mdash;when he actually did owe a very heavy &s;um of more than &pound;.100,000, nominal, be&s;ides 169,000 <HI>Livres,</HI> taken in bills on France, on account of the above balance, in the year, 1780.</P></NOTE> of balances in his favor, &amp;c. R. M. did claim more bills at the very time he owed nominal &s;ums to the Royal Marine, and immen&s;e &s;ums, nominal and real, to J. H. and his friends, on their private account (&mdash;which &s;ums he was al&s;o in duty bound to appropriate for the public &s;ervice, before he could, without inju&s;tice to them and J. H. have &s;old any one bill&mdash;) and if, under tho&s;e circum&s;tances, he did actually take up more bills from the Royal Marine&mdash;does he not owe them to the King, being taken without cau&s;e, or to Holker's ab&s;ent friends? E&s;pecially if he had then in hand their money to purcha&s;e the bills therewith; and this mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e, &s;ince he exclaims&mdash;Can I be &s;o weak as to make good depreciation, &s;ince J. H's money <HI>was peri&s;hing in my hands, was wa&s;ting in che&s;t?</HI>&mdash;Perhaps, however, it was employed for his own purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the re&s;ult of the reflections and opinions of the readers hereof on the foregoing ob&s;ervations, it is now proper to tran&s;cribe another pa&s;&s;age of R. M's letter, which fixes the time during which his fir&s;t principles of accounting are to take effect; for we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the&s;e are only of &s;hort duration, not general, not perma|nent.&mdash;
<Q>From the time I cea&s;ed (&s;ays R. M. page 17) to be your agent, our accounts are no longer to be con|&s;idered
<PB N="27" REF="044903_0028_101F4F4033AFBC38">
as of the nature of a tru&s;t, neither are the accounts between Wm. Turnbull and Co. and me of that nature; I am, therefore, willing to &s;ettle my accounts with them, and tho&s;e with you for <HI>&s;ub&s;equent tran&s;actions upon prin|ciples of depreciation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>From this we are to conclude, that while any confidence, dependence, or tru&s;t is repo&s;ed in him, for &s;o long all monies entru&s;ted to him are to be permitted to peri&s;h in his hands; all concerns confided to his integrity, judgment, and knowledge, are to be forgot or unnoticed as unworthy of attention; <HI>no depreciation</HI> whatever is to be allowed: but when no dependence, as he &s;ays, is placed on his talents and fidelity, he will, of his own motion and accord, allow that the principle of depreciation &s;hall take place between him and J. H. in all ca&s;es, where he was no longer to act as agent for the King's intere&s;t, the intere&s;t of J. H. and that of his friends! Is it R. M. who rea&s;ons thus? What are then his ideas of fidelity, tru&s;t, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Let it however be admitted, for a while, that the&s;e principles are grounded on the &s;olid ba&s;is of hone&s;ty, and that they will lead to &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice, from the accountant R. M. to his employer J. H.&mdash;Then put the que&s;tion&mdash; Do the accounts of his agency, tho&s;e &s;ent with his letter of the 26th of February, 1784, agree with the&s;e principles? The an&s;wer may be collected from what follows:</P>
<P>William Turnbull and Co. his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the agency, began their operations in the fir&s;t days of January, 1780; they credit in <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The deed of copartner&s;hip between R. M. and Wm. Turnbull under the ratio of Wm. Turnbull &amp; Co. is dated and was &s;igned by them, on the 27th day of December, 1779.</NOTE> account R. M. under the date of the 1&s;t of January of that year, for 120,000 dollars, paid by him to Blair M'Clenachan, for the lea&s;e of the hou&s;e they have occupied &s;ince that date; and, R.

H. as their em|ployer; they delivered the&s;e bills as agents for J. H. therefore he acknowledges, by his &s;aid letter, that they were actually his agents under the date of the 15th of February, 1780.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A circum&s;tance which happened to Mr. Wm. Turnbull, about that period, de&s;erves to be noticed here: He waited upon the widow lady, owner of the hou&s;e which he afterwards occupied, to inform her in his own name and that of R. M. that he had purcha&s;ed the remaining lea&s;e thereof, from the gentleman who had lately occupied it, and for which R. M. had paid by agreement, a &s;um of &pound;.45,000, which were therefore a clear profit to that gentleman: he was de&s;ired to relate this circum&s;tance to the lady, and to inform her in the name of the company, that the annual rent would be regular|ly paid her in &s;pecie, let the currency be what it would: and that they not only looked upon it, as their duty, <HI>but abhorred the idea of availing them&s;elves of depreciation.</HI> This was &s;aid to make the lady ea&s;y in her mind, and al&s;o for giving her a plea, for claiming the actual full value of the &s;um of &pound;.300, &s;pecie, due for the rent 1779, by the late occupier who, it was &s;aid, offered her only the &pound;.300, in paper money, or a &s;um inadequate to the real value of the rent: did R. M. here act upon tru&s;t, or upon honour? If &s;uch were his <HI>principles,</HI> in December, 1779, why &s;hould <HI>they</HI> vary &s;o ex|tremely in 1784, why &s;hould he now &s;ay, that he never thought he was to account for the bills, but merely for their nominal proceeds?&mdash;Wm. Turnbull's te&s;timony to be taken on this fact.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now let us weigh the words that follow the above tran&s;cribed paragraph&mdash;
<Q>I find that at the time (No. 1.) when the Royal Marine <HI>owed me</HI> upwards of three hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds continental currency, I had in my (No. 3.) hands of your private funds, and tho&s;e of your friends, nearly to the amount of three hundred thou&s;and pounds continental; and, as I continued <HI>to receive more after that period,</HI> I readily agree (No. 6.) to &s;et a&s;ide Mr. Swanwick's propo&s;ition of valuing the balance in continental money, on your private account, at one hundred for one; he meant to do ju&s;tice between us; but it did not occur to him (No. 2.) that <HI>I had</HI> received on account of the balance in <HI>my favor,</HI> on <HI>your account,</HI> as agent of the Royal Marine, the &s;um of &pound;.342,775 - 2 - 6 continental money, when it was worth &s;ixty-one and a half for one, and that having at the &s;ame time near
<PB N="28" REF="044903_0029_101F4F4539BBC900">
&pound;.300,000 of yours and your friends in my hands, you ought to have the like value for at lea&s;t the latter amount; and, therefore, to &s;ave all <HI>trouble of inve&s;tigation</HI> (No. 5.) as to the exact &s;um, I agree (No. 4.) to compute the &s;ame &s;um which I received &pound;.342,775 - 2 - 6&mdash;at &s;ixty-one and a half, and bring the amount thereof to your credit in the hard money account,&mdash;this (No. 7.) I think <HI>is ju&s;t,</HI> and therefore, <HI>Sir,</HI> I offer it.</Q></P>
<P>No. 1. Here he &s;ays, that the Royal Marine <HI>owed him</HI> more than &pound;.340,000&mdash;</P>
<P>No. 2. He &s;ays,
<Q>it did not occur to Swanwick that I had received on account of the balance in <HI>my favor,</HI> on <HI>your account,</HI> as agent of the Royal Marine, the &s;um of &pound;.342,775 - 2 - 6.</Q></P>
<P>How are we to reconcile the&s;e two &s;entences? Did the Royal Marine owe this &s;um to R. M. or to J. H.? What does the writer mean? Could &s;uch ideas occur to Swanwick or any other? However, it had occurred to R. M. to receive &pound;.342,775 - 2 - 6, in&s;tead of &pound;.340,000, which he &s;ays were due to him at the very time that not <HI>one farthing</HI> was due to him! On the contrary, he then owed more than &pound;.30,000 &s;pecie to the Royal Marine alone, if ju&s;tice is done to him and the King.</P>
<P>No. 3. Here R. M. acknowledges, that three hundred thou&s;and pounds, of Holker's friends money, were then in his hands, at the very time that he took &pound;.342,775 - 2 - 6 from the Royal Marine, which he &s;ays were due to him! If he took this &s;um at the time, why did he not pay J. H's friends? If he took the amount of &pound;.342,775 - 2 - 6 in bills from Holker's agents, why did he not give tho&s;e bills to J. H's friends? If he kept the bills for his own ac|count, is he not to pay them to his friends, with intere&s;t from their date? If he took them on account of a &s;uppo&s;ed balance, &s;aid to be due to him by the Royal Marine, is he not to return them with intere&s;t, to the Royal Marine? It is his bu&s;ine&s;s to extricate him&s;elf from this embarra&s;sment; it is his part to get out of the dilemma, into which his own avowal has plunged him, if he can; for, really, we cannot, on this occa&s;ion, come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>No. 4. Here he offers the balance, which he &s;ays he had received, namely &pound;.342,775 - 2 - 6, (and which he &s;uppo&s;es to be due, when he cea&s;ed to be agent for J. H.) at the exchange of &s;ixty-one and a half for one,&mdash;the rate of depreciation in April 1780&mdash;But why does he not offer it at the exchange of December, 1779, when the balance was due, and he had cea&s;ed to act as public agent&mdash;or of January, 1780, when Wm. Turnbull and Co. had commenced agents; was it becau&s;e the exchange <HI>then</HI> being at &s;ixty-one and a half, in&s;tead of forty in January, he thereby would only pay two thirds of the &s;um he owed in January? The auditors will e&s;tabli&s;h this point, nor &s;hall we hereafter forget the propo&s;al.</P>
<P>No. 5. R. M. &s;eems very de&s;irous of avoiding all inve&s;tigation, as to the exact &s;um due to J. H. or to his friends, at this as well as any other period, and therefore No. 6, he readily agrees to lay a&s;ide Swanwick's propo&s;al of one hundred for one; he adds No. 7, this I think is ju&s;t, and therefore I offer it.</P>
<P>But to return to the object of depreciation, let us take up the accounts, which were tran&s;mitted by R. M. with his letter of the 26th of February, 1784. There we &s;hall find a &s;um of &pound;.150,000 continental, and 2&frac12; per cent. commi&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a &s;ingular commi&s;&s;ion, claimed only in 1784, on a &s;um never before charged in the public account, and on a &s;um paid in the fir&s;t days of June, 1780, by a credit to be given by Wm. Smith, (R. M's. corre&s;pondent) to Me&s;&s;rs. Wm. Turnbull &amp; Co. agents for J. H.</NOTE> thereon, charged to the debit of the Royal Marine,&mdash;for &s;o much he paid to J. H. with his con&s;ent, by his order dated the 30th of May, 1780, to William Smith E&s;q. of Baltimore, when he directed him to credit in account, Me&s;&s;rs. Wm. Turnbull &amp; Co. as agents for J. H. for the above &s;um of &pound;.150,000, and for which he &s;ays, he was to under&s;tand with J. H. How, therefore, could R. M. pre&s;ume to bring this charge again&s;t the Royal Marine, for a payment made on the thirtieth of May, 1780, and to the credit of J. H's. agents, when his public

agency had cea&s;ed in December, 1779?&mdash;He acknowledges that he is willing to allow the principle of depreciation, at the clo&s;e of his agency, and to extend it to all &s;ums he received at a later period:&mdash;and yet he does not think pro|per to avail him&s;elf of the advantage of his own propo&s;al, when he pays money on account: certainly, this man mu&s;t be moved by &s;ome extraordinary principle of action, on this occa&s;ion: and this may be readily conceived of one &s;o &s;trenuous in exertions in his own favour. Here he refu&s;es the exchange of &s;ixty for one on the foregoing &pound;. 150,000, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

on this &s;ingle payment to R. M. at the expence of J. H.&mdash; and this R. M. and his coun&s;el offer, in Febr. 1784, as &s;ub|&s;tantial ju&s;tice.</NOTE> which would entitle him to a &s;um of &pound;. 2500, <HI>hard money.</HI></P>
<P>However, upon a clo&s;er examination, the true motive will be di&s;covered, and the original leading principles of this man be e&s;tabli&s;hed:&mdash;Without this charge of &pound;. 150,000, nominal, R. M. would have fallen con&s;iderably in debt to the Royal Marine, at that very period, at which he declares, that &pound;. 342,000 and more were due to him, and this would not look well. Upon further inve&s;tigation, it will be al&s;o acknowledged, that this charge and commi&s;&s;ion are to act nominally, though not virtually and in fact, again&s;t a &s;um of 450,000 <HI>Livres</HI> Tournois given him in bills in March, 1779, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide J. H's obver&s;ations on the public account, and his &s;tatement thereof.</NOTE> and which he then claimed on account of his <HI>actual</HI> advances, the whole of which large &s;um, equal to more than &pound;. 20,000 &s;terling, has <HI>melted wa&s;ted away,</HI> and <HI>peri&s;hed totally</HI> and <HI>wholly</HI> through a <HI>premature unnece&s;&s;ary</HI> &s;ale which occa&s;ioned con&s;equent depreciation, as he &s;ays, in his hands: therefore we mu&s;t own that, though R. M's mode of rea&s;oning is not always clear, ju&s;t and con&s;i&s;tent, &s;till his actions, his principles and manner of pre&s;enting and redacting e&s;timates and accounts to his advantage, are perfectly con&s;i&s;tent; all calculated to acquire an overgrown fortune, at the expence of <HI>truth,</HI> of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> of the <HI>King</HI> and his <HI>employer,</HI> of <HI>him</HI> whom he termed his <HI>bo&s;om friend,</HI> of <HI>him</HI> who wi&s;hing to throw equitable advantages in the hands of R. M. had confidentially entru&s;ted him with the means, and generou&s;ly &s;econded his often&s;ible views. But, can this be allowed? Shall R. M. involve this &s;um in his accounts, in order to make the&s;e nominal &pound;. 150,000, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Let the reader here remark, that in January, 1779, R. M. had forgot to charge a &s;um of &pound;.99,080-10-0 again&s;t the Royal Marine, for which J. H. was to account to the King in his own &s;tatement of his Bo&s;ton operations; there|fore it is probable that the&s;e &pound;. 150,000 are introduced in the year 1784, into the accounts of R. M's agency for the year 1779, in order to counterbalance this heavy omi&s;&s;ion of a charge of &s;uch con&s;equence, in January, 1779. But thereby he makes another nominal mi&s;take of more than &pound;.50,000 in his own favor. Such is the extreme regularity of R. M's no|minal mode of accounting, under his favorite &s;uppo&s;ition of his being a banker&mdash;a mere depo&s;itary of continental cur|rency.</NOTE> paid in Baltimore, (when he knew not probably what to do with the money) be brought in the public account of <HI>his</HI> agency, at the very time that he actually owed J. H. in his private account, near three times this &s;um, and probably twenty times the &s;um in real &s;pecie, if the law, equity, u&s;age and a &s;cale of depreciation are to govern and take place throughout his tran&s;actions? This &s;cale it would be nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h, in order to explain his operations and mode of action, even if ju&s;tice did not require it.</P>
<P>I will here remind the reader of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, that the principles he lays down in his letter, he does not even follow in tho&s;e very accounts, which he &s;ends to his employer on the very &s;ame day; or rather he choo&s;es in his letter to expre&s;s one idea, and as an accountant to follow another, much better calculated to cover his mode of operation: nor is he more con&s;i&s;tent in his <HI>argument</HI> on this occa&s;ion than in his propo&s;als or principles of account render.</P>
<P>On the argument, we have &s;een that he maintains, he was only a banker and depo&s;itary for J. H. during the whole of his agency. The tran&s;actions between J. H. and R. M. were merely of the nature of a tru&s;t, &s;ays the
<PB N="30" REF="044903_0031_101F4F496359CE00">
latter: and therefore he will not allow any depreciation, nor account on the principles of depreciation for any con|cerns, during the whole period of his agency. His agency on the public bu&s;ine&s;s cea&s;ed in die fir&s;t days of January, 1780, and becau&s;e he allows the principle of depreciation to take place on all <HI>occa&s;ions &s;ub&s;equent thereto,</HI> either between Wm. Turnbull and Co. or him, or J. H. and R. M.&mdash;therefore, &s;ays our logician, I will fix the rate of value of the monies <HI>due to J. H. in December,</HI> by the <HI>&s;cale in April</HI>; but I will fix no value on the monies I paid to Wm. Turnbull and Co. on the 30th of May, 1780, in Baltimore. Let us now a&s;k him, why he allows any depreciation whatever, to J. H. without working the good deed throughout? Is he aware of the con&s;equences of this his con|ce&s;&s;ion? Does he know, that by the &s;ame principle on which this conce&s;&s;ion is grounded, he grants all that is claimed from him? For he mu&s;t either be ab&s;urd in the extreme, and erroneous in every one of his arguments, or he is guilty of inju&s;tice;&mdash;he mu&s;t either be deprived of the u&s;e of rea&s;on, and be de&s;titute of common &s;en&s;e or com|mon hone&s;ty, or he mu&s;t give up the bills, unle&s;s he can procure a better title to them than appears in his letter.&mdash; And now for the proof of what is here advanced.</P>
<P>R. M. maintains, that during his agency he was not an&s;werable for depreciation of monies, put (he &s;ays) into his hands. Why? Becau&s;e he was only banker; he was not agent-re&s;pon&s;ible, not a bailiff in law; but only an <HI>agent-depo&s;itary,</HI> accountable only for nominal &s;ums of a peri&s;hable currency:&mdash;in other words, he was accountable for the number of hog&s;heads of mola&s;&s;es put into his &s;tore&mdash;for the mere hog&s;heads, and not for the contents.</P>
<P>He afterwards argues, that when he was no longer agent, he can no longer be con&s;idered to have acted <HI>on tru&s;t;</HI> and, therefore, he will grant the principle of depreciation.</P>
<P>Now let it be ob&s;erved, that according to the&s;e ideas, if he cea&s;ed to be agent he cea&s;ed al&s;o to be a banker or de|po&s;itary. The que&s;tion, therefore, in this view, is&mdash;what became of R. M? Quis invenit? I know not of a de&s;cription by which we can afterwards legally define his &s;ub&s;equent character or functions. He denied in his fir&s;t po&s;ition, that he was re&s;pon&s;ible for J. H's concerns; he was not bailiff, becau&s;e he was only agent upon tru&s;t, id e&s;t, &s;ays he, banker and depo&s;itary. Afterwards, when come to nothing, when he has no known legal or avowed mercantile character and denomination, then he &s;ays&mdash;after I cea&s;ed to be your agent, then I will allow the principle of depreciation; but as it is difficult for him to change his character, we mu&s;t rea&s;on thus: he allows of depreciation when he cea&s;ed to be agent, becau&s;e he was no longer employed <HI>upon tru&s;t</HI>; and, therefore, we &s;ay, becau&s;e he was banker and depo&s;itary only. It is unlucky for him in this ca&s;e, that he mu&s;t al&s;o allow depreciation on the preceding accounts; becau&s;e he maintains that he was then al&s;o banker and depo&s;itary.&mdash;For one and the &s;ame principle mu&s;t be followed throughout; unle&s;s principles re&s;pecting his accounts are to change with the new year, and that the principle of depreciation is not to be attended to in 1779, but only in 1780. If he denies this rea|&s;oning to be fair and ju&s;t, then he mu&s;t fall into the following ab&s;urdity and argue thus: While I was agent (id e&s;t banker) I will not allow the principle when I cea&s;ed to be agent then I will allow the principle, becau&s;e I received the &s;ub&s;equent monies not as agent, but only as banker.</P>
<P>However, to put an end to all &s;uch puerile jargon, it is nece&s;&s;ary to remind him, that he never cea&s;ed to be agent of J. H. in tho&s;e concerns entru&s;ted to his management, from the moment they came under his notice and care to this hour: he <HI>only</HI> cea&s;ed in December, 1779, to act as agent in <HI>new concerns</HI> on the <HI>public account</HI>: he is yet accountable for the previous tran&s;actions; though he di&s;continued and clo&s;ed his operations early in 1780, and might then have rendered his accounts thereof, if he had thought proper not to delay the &s;ettlement, having been con&s;tantly pre&s;&s;ed on this &s;core. In 1780, he engaged for and with J. H. on his private account, in &s;ome new concerns, after that &s;ame period, at which, he &s;ays, we are to con&s;ider his agency as terminated.&mdash;Of the whole
<PB N="31" REF="044903_0032_101F4F4B1F7A2E88">
concerns and balances, in his hands, he owes accounts; and we are obliged to bring &s;uits at law, to obtain &s;uch as ju&s;tice and equity pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>If R. M. never cea&s;ed to be J. H's agent and bailiff and banker, as he contends in &s;ome in&s;tances, why &s;hould he allow the principle of depreciation in 1780 and 1781? Was it becau&s;e in the&s;e la&s;t years he only received pence, and becau&s;e he received pounds, in 1777, 1778 and 1779? The rea&s;on is then mo&s;t admirable, though it would aggravate the inju&s;tice. Whether banker, or broker, or agent and bailiff, he owes depreciation, according to his own conviction and principle, from the time, when he <HI>fir&s;t commenced to act</HI> on the concerns of J. H. in his private and public capacity: e&s;pecially, as he previou&s;ly engaged to act for his intere&s;t and that of the King, and con&s;e|quently to &s;ave them and guard them and J. H's friends, from damage, lo&s;s and ruin: &mdash;he was agent or banker re&s;pon&s;ible on a &s;cale of depreciation in the end of the bu&s;ine&s;s and, of cour&s;e, in the beginning and progre&s;s thereof: nor can any di&s;tinction be made between tho&s;e intere&s;ts and concerns, which relate to the public &s;ervice from tho&s;e of a private nature; nor can any difference of principle or of value be made, between the King's bills and dollars of Congre&s;s's money, or J.

<P>Thus far, we believe the argument again&s;t R. M. to be ju&s;t, candid and true; and if granted, then it will fol|low, that if R. M. owes depreciation on the proceeds of tho&s;e bills he &s;old, becau&s;e the &s;ales were unnece&s;&s;ary, be|cau&s;e there was no employment for their proceeds, or becau&s;e he had other public or private monies, given to him for the &s;ervice, peri&s;hing in his hands&mdash;he al&s;o mu&s;t make good the lo&s;s on the &s;ale of tho&s;e bills; for he &s;old them without cau&s;e. Having proved that he took the very bills in kind, under the cover of fal&s;e and fictitious &s;ales, made to his partner White&s;ide, we have a right to pre&s;ume he &s;old the other bills, which he afterwards claimed in that &s;ame month at lea&s;t, &s;ay March 1779, in order to apply the proceeds to his private &s;peculations and purpo&s;es, when money would command any thing on the mo&s;t advantageous terms; or to pre&s;ume that he al&s;o got other per&s;ons to endor&s;e other bills for him; and this is but ju&s;t to &s;uppo&s;e and believe, unle&s;s he will produce freely and fully his books, ca&s;h|book, &amp;c. in order to convince us that he was only guilty of taking improperly one &s;um of &pound;.3,800 &s;terling, with|out paying one farthing at the time on account thereof. This argument and the con&s;equences are fair; for the money could not have peri&s;hed in his hands, if he had not <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his letter of February, 1784, he makes it, or in&s;inu|ates it as, a charge again&s;t J.

Are they conformable to the accounts rendered, and to tho&s;e to be &s;ettled by the auditors? Are they accurate, correct, full and true? Does not R. M. claim balances, by the e&s;timates and accounts? Did he ever produce one account before April, 1780, by which a balance appeared to be due to J. H? How, therefore, can he &s;ay or pretend, that it was not his fault, if the ba|lances due were not drawn out of his hands, or that the&s;e &s;ums of money, due by balance, were ready in his che&s;t to J. H's order? Is not this a&s;&s;ertion of R.

How could he po&s;&s;ibly be in advance for J. H. and at the &s;ame time maintain, that the balances due to J. H. (balances utterly unknown to J. H. on the public account, until the year 1784) were con&s;tantly kept on hand, to the order of the agent general, to draw them out when he plea&s;ed? And if this a&s;&s;ertion is untrue, (and the ac|counts, as rendered originally and now profered, prove it to be untrue, and demon&s;trate that he always concealed the balances due by him) will not this &s;ort of argument operate again&s;t him&s;elf, and prove that he owes depreciation, and the lo&s;s of &s;ale upon the bills? His a&s;&s;ertions, excu&s;es, and apologies, are not grounded on fact, on the &s;olid ba&s;is of truth. By attempting to prove his innocence, by defending with vehemence, and with unju&s;t in&s;inuations again&s;t his employer, tho&s;e principles by which he in&s;i&s;ts, that he is not to be made accountable for his tran&s;actions, is it not apparent that he knows, there are great loo&s;ings on his mode of e&s;tabli&s;hing the accounts, and that he fears the con&s;equences of his conduct will affect him&s;elf, and not the King, his employer, or his employers friends? It would have been much more to his honor and reputation, if he had &s;aid le&s;s on the general principle.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould he be &s;o much afraid of the con&s;equences? He is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an immen&s;e fortune, acquired by the means above de&s;cribed, and by others, more or le&s;s laudable; but principally during 1778 and 1779,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1778 and 1779 R.

And becau&s;e the&s;e bills, on the public and private account, amount to a large &s;um, is he therefore not to pay the &s;ame? Is he to be excu&s;ed from paying intere&s;t, when on the one hand it can be proved, that it was a breach of tru&s;t in him to have &s;old the bills, if there was no occa&s;ion for making &s;ale thereof; and when on the other hand, he has brought ruin all around him, through &s;uch a breach of tru&s;t, and

Dollars. 43453 for one half of this gain you are credited by me in account current on the 7th April, 1780; and on this &s;um <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Here he paid depreciation till April, 1780; by his letter of the 26th of February, 1784, he offers to value the monies due then, by the &s;cale of that month; but, forgetting this propo&s;al, by which he allows depreciation whatever, he here reproaches J. H. with improperly claiming depreciation. Is it R. M. who rea&s;ons thus, or the then &s;uperintendent of finance?</NOTE> al&s;o you claim depreciation, when you have actually received it.</Q></P>
<P>In addition to what has been &s;aid on a &s;imilar &s;ubject, re&s;pecting a &s;um of &pound;. 3800 &s;terling, in bills &s;old to White&s;ide, in May, 1779, (vide page 22.25) we mu&s;t expre&s;s our &s;urprize that he &s;hould mention this &s;um of 54,722 <HI>Livres</HI> 18 <HI>&s;ols,</HI> when &s;peaking of depreciation, &s;ince the remaining bills, not employed on joint account, in the purcha&s;e of a ve&s;&s;el, being &s;old in April, J.

M. (through Swanwick) had offered the advance dollars at the rate of 100 for one, and therefore J. H. had then at lea&s;t a right to claim another valuation from the principal R. M. and this is hereby confe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Let us now a&s;k, For what rea&s;on does R. M. intere&s;t J. H. in the&s;e bills? Did he take them from William Turnbull &amp; Co. on their joint account, or on his account <HI>&s;olely</HI>? What do Mr. Turnbull's books &s;ay on this occa&s;ion, and tho&s;e of R. M? That Hou&s;e debits him for the&s;e bills to the credit of the Royal Marine, on account of the balance claimed by him as due to him from the Royal Marine, becau&s;e he paid nothing on account thereof. In his accounts R. M. credits them for the&s;e bills, as bought from them, though by the foregoing entries, it would &s;eem he did not buy them, but a&s;&s;umed them on account of the balance he then claimed, and on account whereof, he afterwards took many more, to the amount of 169,000 <HI>Livres.</HI></P>

<P>The que&s;tions, therefore, on this &s;ubject are&mdash;Was a balance due to him or not? And how much, if any? Did he owe monies at the time to J. H? When 36,000 <HI>Livres</HI> were only nece&s;&s;ary for this tran&s;action, or rather, when he had only 18,000 <HI>Livres</HI> to claim from J. H. on account of his half of the brigantine, why then take 54,000 <HI>Livres</HI> from the &s;ubordinate agents of the Royal Marine, leaving J. H. to account to the King as he can, for the whole &s;um, and which will not be very ea&s;y, &s;ince the &s;ale thereof was not nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ervice? Why take bills from J. H's agents without paying for them, when he had monies enough of his on hand to purcha&s;e J. H's &s;hare of the bills? Would J. H. have con&s;ented to this arrangement at all, if R. M. had not led him to believe in December, 1779, that he was in his debt by the accounts he produced and gave to J. H. for his government? Would he not have in&s;i&s;ted that if R. M. wanted the bills he &s;hould have paid for them, &s;ince thereby it would have prevented a &s;ale of a &s;imilar &s;um, on account of, and for the &s;ub&s;equent expenditures of the Royal Marine by the agents at the time? And is not R. M. an&s;werable for the&s;e bills to the Royal Marine, &s;ince he did not pay for them, though, he &s;ays, he bought them; he charging J. H. for the value of 18,000 <HI>Livres</HI> paid on his account, taking to him&s;elf the gain on the remaining bills? This would be fair and ju&s;t. Otherwi&s;e, would not J.

claims from J. H. are both of a higher value, than when it was his duty to have paid for both, to have purcha&s;ed both, with J. H's monies? In other words, &s;hall R. M. becau&s;e he has to account for his tran&s;actions, dictate in 1784, the form and principles of accounts at his own will and plea&s;ure, to vary them in every operation according to his intere&s;t, and explain away the fortune of all his employers, or &s;hall ju&s;tice, law and equity take place in this ca&s;e? We claim nothing more.</P>
<P>When &s;peaking of the improper claim of R. M. for bills on France, as early as the 11th of March, 1779, for his pretended advances on account of the Royal Marine, we delayed mentioning a tran&s;action which took place about the 7th of that &s;ame month, and under which date R. M. credits the Royal Marine for &pound;.24,666 continental, pro|ceeds of &pound;.2740 - 13 - 4 &s;terling, by him received in bills on France.</P>
<P>When in Bo&s;ton, J. H. drew on R. M. at ten days &s;ight, various bills to the amount of near &pound;77,656 - 5 - 0, which were afterwards reduced by J. H. while in Bo&s;ton, to &pound;.54,981 - 11 - 3&mdash;they bore date of the 16th of October, 1778.</P>
<P>On account thereof, J. H. remitted a bill of &pound;.61,196 - 1 - 3, drawn by a continental agent on the commi&s;&s;ary general of Congre&s;s, and pa&s;&s;ed by J. H. to the order of R. M. advi&s;ing him at the &s;ame time&mdash;not to receive this money, but in ca&s;e of need for the King's &s;ervice; as he wi&s;hed it to remain with Congre&s;s, on account of provi|&s;ions &s;upplied by their agent in Bo&s;ton. R. M. however got this bill paid in Philadelphia, at the trea&s;ury, on the 10th of November following, through the hands of Benjamin Hogeland his clerk; but whether with or without any nece&s;&s;ity for the King's &s;ervice, the accounts of the auditors will more preci&s;ely a&s;certain. A few of the&s;e bills drawn in Bo&s;ton by J. H. on R. M. were paid in December, 1778, the re&s;t in January, February and March, 1779. However, on the 7th of March of that year, of the&s;e Bo&s;ton bills a &s;um of 63,338 dollars 4<HI>&s;</HI>6, or there|abouts, was profered to R. M. for payment, being part of tho&s;e drawn by J. H. to the order of Adam Babcock of Bo&s;ton, and was given by Adam Babcock's corre&s;pondent as part payment of the &pound;24,666 continental, nece&s;&s;ary for the purcha&s;e of the abovementioned bills on France for &pound;.2740 - 13 - 4 &s;terling, which were al&s;o drawn at the re|que&s;t of R. M. to the order of &s;aid Adam Babcock.</P>
<P>Here we mu&s;t fir&s;t ob&s;erve, that in order, we &s;uppo&s;e, to conceal this tran&s;action and the dates of acceptances or payment, no bills drawn on R. M. have been produced as vouchers in &s;upport of his accounts, though all vouchers were claimed from him and ordered to be given up by the arbitrators.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> All the bills of J. H. on R. M. from Bo&s;ton, not charged as paid in 1778, are charged in his monthly account, redacted for the arbitrators, as paid in January, 1779, though few were even accepted for payment in the run of that month.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> This money proceeding from the bill drawn on the commi&s;&s;ary general of Congre&s;s, was not nece&s;&s;ary in 1778 to R. M. Nota bene. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N. B.

February and March, 1778, as appears by R. M's confe&s;&s;ion in his letter, which, circum&s;tance he mentions in or|der to criminate bis employer, though he knew that the &s;u&s;picions he throws out were unju&s;t.&mdash;Of this we &s;hall &s;peak more at large hereafter.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly.</HI> This confe&s;&s;ion proves, that the money from Congre&s;s not being wanted for the King's &s;ervice, the whole or greate&s;t part thereof might have been better employed for the u&s;e of the continent, than in the hands of R. M.</P>
<P N="6">6<HI>thly.</HI> If the bills upon France were employed for the purpo&s;e of taking up in 1779, the bills drawn upon R. M. on the 16 of October 1778, is it not a &s;trong pre&s;umptive proof, that in November, 1779, R. M. had employed for his own purpo&s;es the whole &pound;.61,196 - 1 - 3, which he carefully had got paid, without nece&s;&s;ity, from the public trea&s;ury? Is it not apparent, that when he paid tho&s;e drafts in 1779, he had no money on hand but what aro&s;e from the daily &s;ale of the bills on France, &s;upplied him by J. H. for his pretended wants?</P>
<P N="7">7<HI>thly.</HI> On the 7th of March he had not any money in che&s;t, or a &s;mall &s;um, for he took and claimed from J. H. &pound;2740 &s;terling in bills, to di&s;charge Holker's drafts on him from Bo&s;ton; the&s;e drafts and J. H's bills on France being in both ca&s;es drawn to the order of Adam Babcock of Bo&s;ton, the bills being negociated and the drafts taken up at one and the &s;ame in&s;tant.</P>
<P N="8">8<HI>thly.</HI> This poverty of R. M's che&s;t, in March 1779, will appear e&s;tabli&s;hed to perfect conviction, &s;ince he acknowledges on the 11th day following, to have &s;old to White&s;ide &amp; Co. and afterwards taken &pound;.3800 &s;terling to him&s;elf, on account of his advances for the Royal Marine, and for which advances he claimed the bills from the King's agent.&mdash;The pretended advances he would not not have felt or dreamt of if he had been rich in che&s;t; where|fore we may conclude, that when he agreed upon the arbitration, that he employed all Holker's money in his hands, without di&s;tinction whatever, as opportunities offered, he did not &s;ay too much; &s;ince his claim of bills on the 11th of March, on account of his advances, is &s;upported by his claim of bills on the 7th; becau&s;e he could not take up the Bo&s;ton drafts &s;o conveniently, without either diverting the funds on hand from &s;ome lucrative employment or ve&s;tment in view, or without &s;elling &s;ome object or inve&s;tment, or merchandize on hand or in &s;tore, at a le&s;&s;er profit than it would have commanded at a later period.</P>
<P N="9">9<HI>thly.</HI> We mu&s;t further remark, that on the payment of the&s;e drafts from Bo&s;ton, and on the negociation of the bills, R. M. claims and is entitled to the commi&s;&s;ion of an agent by previous &s;tipulation, tho' he &s;carcely received a dollar of continental money in either ca&s;e, nor did he even indor&s;e Holker's bills, &s;ince he got them drawn to the order of Adam Babcock. Yet he maintains,&mdash;he was not agent re&s;pon&s;ible, or bailiff, but agent upon tru&s;t, <HI>a banker</HI>; e&s;pecially &s;ince he received no con&s;ideration for the care and cu&s;tody of the goods in &s;tore, for attending to the King's money in his che&s;t, which, el&s;ewhere he &s;ays, was peri&s;hing in his hands&mdash;Did the money of Congre&s;s in this ca&s;e, or the money ari&s;ing from the bills on France of the King's agent, peri&s;h in his hands, in his che&s;t, in his &s;tore?</P>
<P N="10">10<HI>thly.</HI> From the above we may form an idea of the manner in which he carried on his operations, when under cover of the confidence repo&s;ed in him by J. H. with what zeal he held forth his aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his country, then &s;truggling for independence, and working again&s;t the tide of depreciation of their currency. Thus he attended to the intere&s;t of a generous King and nation every where fighting for his &s;afety, and the future happine&s;s of him&s;elf and his po&s;terity! Whatever may be the ca&s;e in this re&s;pect, every one will be convinced, that depreciation at lea&s;t never reached R. M. in this in&s;tance; that no money in this in&s;tance peri&s;hed in his hands; that the public bills were not employed for public purpo&s;es, but to take up his own engagements (having him&s;elf employed tho&s;e monies tran&s;|mitted to him, to an&s;wer all demands made upon him). Then, &s;hall he not return the bills with intere&s;t, &s;ince the

in favor of R. M.&mdash;Thus &s;uppo&s;ing the ve&s;tment of the continental money in &s;pecie in November, and the &s;ale thereof in March following, R. M. would have cleared &pound;.1428 - 18 - 1, by depreciation alone, on the money of Congre&s;s, on one &s;um of &pound;.20,000<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He received &pound;.61,196 - 1 - 3 public money.</NOTE> only; and this may explain why he took up the money from the trea&s;ury on the 10th of November, without any other po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on. But in bills the profit is much greater&mdash;he was only to ac|count nominally for the proceeds of the bills drawn at his reque&s;t to the order of Adam Babcock, in March, 1780, at a later period; and this cannot have taken place by his accounts, but in the fall of that &s;ame year, when money was at 30 or 40 for one, and then the profit is in proportion greater. Suppo&s;e the nominal employment on the King's account was made when money was at forty, then the profit is &pound;.2,833 - 13 - 4, on a &s;um of &pound;.3,333 - 13 - 4. Can &s;uch profits be allowed in equity? Can the lo&s;s on the &s;ale of bills be allowed in order to give R. M. &s;uch ex|tortionate advantages? And &s;hall the King's agent be condemned to make good the&s;e bills in the King's trea&s;ury in France, for the &s;ake of &s;uch a &s;ubordinate agent, in who&s;e honor he had confided, becau&s;e he was al&s;o confided in by his countrymen, fellow-citizens and Congre&s;s?&mdash;For a &s;ubordinate agent, who declared on the arbitration, that he knew nothing of depreciation in all 1778 and 1779, and who accu&s;es his employer of want of fidelity to his &s;overeign, becau&s;e he drew the bills which he (R. M.) employed, to fulfil his own engagements? By way of apology to him, for this &s;evere &s;crutiny and inve&s;tigation, we mu&s;t here tran&s;cribe what he &s;ays on the &s;ubject of tho&s;e bills drawn on R. M. from Bo&s;ton, and which &s;ubject we have entered upon more fully in our fir&s;t letter of &s;elf-ju&s;tification, wrote in reply to R. M's wicked in&s;inuations in his favorite letter of the 26th of February, 1784. (Vide page 15.)</P>
<P>Speaking of the claim of depreciation on general principles, and on the nature of the accounts betwixt him and J. H. he writes:</P>
<P><Q>Before I quit the &s;ubject I will &s;elect two or three in&s;tances from tho&s;e accounts, which will bring the rea&s;oning <HI>more home to your perceptions.</HI> The King paid 400,000 <HI>Livres</HI> for two prizes, taken by the privateers Hancock and Bo&s;ton; you agreed with the owners for &pound;.70,000 lawful money; you paid in part your bills for 45,000 <HI>Livres,</HI> (&pound;.7875.) and drew on me for the remainder &pound;62,125&mdash;which &s;ums together make &pound;.70,000 lawful.

But how could J. H. pocket any &s;uch difference? For when R.

M's calculation is fal&s;e, his relation of the fact, wrote when the accounts were under his eyes, is untrue.&mdash;What &s;hall we believe from &s;uch a man?</P>
<P>But to &s;hew that malice, and the fear of accounting on hone&s;t and ju&s;t principles, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his &s;oul, and de|prived him of all rea&s;on, when he wrote this infidious letter, it is &s;ufficient to remind the reader of his &s;aying that J. H. when he paid his own drafts on R. M. did it with the proceeds of his public bills on France. He forgot that J. H's money and that of his friends paid in July and Augu&s;t, 1778, to R. M. and his remittance on the com|mi&s;&s;ary general, are credited in account to J. H. and were to be employed by R. M. to take up tho&s;e &s;ame drafts on Philadelphia in 1778, for which (he &s;ays) the <HI>proceeds of the public bills</HI> were employed <HI>by J. H.</HI> in March 1779.&mdash; tho' the&s;e proceeds were received by R. M. by him employed in his own &s;peculations or to take up his own en|gagements, and have entirely di&s;appeared through depreciation, if his &s;tatement of accounts is allowed, and have occa&s;ioned the total lo&s;s of the bills drawn, as he &s;ays, to take up Holker's drafts from Bo&s;ton. Let us now grant to R. M. for a moment the full force of his allegation again&s;t his employer, and with him pretend to believe&mdash;that the difference on this whole tran&s;action, on the&s;e 400,000 <HI>Livres,</HI> was a gain to him (J. H.) of 155,000 <HI>Livres</HI> Tournois&mdash;(Vide page 16.) What can we conclude from thence? Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that J. H. did attempt to gain 300,000 <HI>Livres</HI> on 400,000 <HI>Livres,</HI> &s;till he would not have attempted to gain as much as R. M.&mdash;&pound;.2800 out of &pound;.3300&mdash;and &s;acrifice one third of the original value of the bills on the &s;ale thereof, in order to rai&s;e the &pound;.500 nece&s;&s;ary to make up the difference of payment. And if J. H. is &s;uppo&s;ed to have actually made the gain, accord|ing to R. M's words, then we &s;hall fall into an ab&s;urdity; for all Holker's accounts are grounded on tho&s;e of R. M. which form near one third of the value to be accounted for, and are the fir&s;t to be accounted for; therefore he has not made the gain of 155,000 <HI>Livres,</HI> &s;ince he has not ever yet been able to redact, much le&s;s propo&s;e his accounts, in order to make any gain whatever.</P>
<P>From hence it is al&s;o to be concluded that J. H. has not <HI>even attempted</HI> to make this gain; but it may &s;till be &s;up|po&s;ed that he had that intention, and that R. M. knew his intention: this being granted, his argument will run as follows:</P>
<P>J. H. working the nefarious plan of depreciation again&s;t the King, or in other words, making great gain him&s;elf through a nominal &s;et of accounts, in&s;i&s;ts with R. M. that he &s;hall account to J. H. on a &s;cale <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> depreciation, for his tran&s;actions on behalf of the Royal Marine, at the very time that R. M. can prove, that he (J. H.) had intended at lea&s;t to gain 155,000 <HI>Livres</HI> by depreciation, from one &s;ingle payment of 400,000 <HI>Livres,</HI> made on behalf of the King:
<PB N="40" REF="044903_0041_101F4F70B8D7F8B0">
and as &s;o gro&s;s an injury to the King's intere&s;t mu&s;t not take place in favor of J. H. therefore he in&s;erts in his letter of February, 1784, that J. H. has actually made the gain of &s;o large a &s;um. Unluckily R. M. forgot that the a&s;&s;ertion de&s;erved a reply.</P>
<P>Is it becau&s;e J. H. (to &s;peak plain) has cheated the King, that R. M. is to cheat J. H? Is it becau&s;e J. H. had intended and attempted to cheat his King, that R. M. is to cheat actually and effectually J. H. and al&s;o the King and J. H's friends, through the fallacious medium of depreciation? But if J. H has gained 155,000 <HI>Livres,</HI> and R. M. gains them upon J. H. where is the profit to J. H? Can he in this &s;ituation be termed a cheat, with any truth? Without having derived any advantage from his fraud, e&s;pecially by R. M? At mo&s;t it can only be &s;aid that he did attempt it, but was weak enough to be outwitted in the attempt by that confidential agent, whom he employed and paid to redact the accounts of his own tran&s;actions&mdash;his Bo&s;ton tran&s;actions. But if this gain is gone from J. H. how will he be able to refund the King, &s;hould his mini&s;ters one day or other di&s;cover the attempt, and the knavery of the agent general? How will he be able to account to the officers and crews of Count D'E&s;taing's Fleet for the real value of the monies which the commander thereof entru&s;ted to his good faith? And if this game is to be played upon J. H. throughout, by R. M. how then will J. Holker's friends be redeemed from ruin, when their for|tunes will have been di&s;&s;ipated under the cloak of depreciation, and the lo&s;s be explained away by R. M. in a &s;et of accounts?</P>
<P>Is R. M. to attempt thus to cheat J. H. and then call out cheat fir&s;t, turn informer, and threaten J. H.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Will it not &s;urpri&s;e all impartial men, that though J. H. may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have intended to &s;ecure to him&s;elf the ad|vantages of depreciation, R. M. &s;hould have imagined that he could terrify J. H. from his claims on him, by in&s;inuating the attempt, and reproaching him with having &s;elfi&s;h views to an&s;wer, when in fact there is but one principle, one &s;ingle equitable mode of &s;ettling accounts between J. H. and R. M. between J. H. and the King, between J. H. and his friends? And has not R. M. &s;een J.

And is this language to be held by R. M. when he knew that as early as January, February and March, 1779, in all Holker's letters to the King's &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, he informs them of the &s;avings he has made on the Bo&s;ton trans|actions, of the advantageous rate of exchange of bills, then &s;elling in Philadelphia for the payment of the debts con|tracted in Bo&s;ton by the King's fleet, and due to individuals, to him&s;elf, and to Congre&s;s? This R. M. knew at the time, he knew that J. H. made his pride thereof, and that he vaunted and gloried in his &s;ucce&s;sful endeavours for the King's intere&s;t, to R. M. him&s;elf, to Mr. Gerard, and all others to whom he could confidentially &s;peak on the &s;ub|ject. This R. M. has heard J. H. &s;peak of repeatedly: but, res miranda! at that very time, R. M was medi|tating the plan of accu&s;ing him, &s;ome day or other, of the&s;e very exertions on the King's behalf; and to maintain at a later period, that the whole was a cheat, becau&s;e there was a gain of 150,000 <HI>Livres</HI> to J. H. on 400,000 <HI>Livres,</HI> in order to cover his own plan of working depreciation again&s;t J. H.</P>
<P>It may be &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome, that this was not really intended by R. M. that it was only a hint, by way of ob&s;er|vation, made from R. M. in a letter to J. H. &s;o artfully written, that tho' it conveyed the idea of a gain that could be made by J. H. if his accounts were properly &s;tated, &s;till J.

H. it will be the free gift, the free conce&s;&s;ion of the King through his mini&s;ters: if &s;uch a profit could exi&s;t, even then it would be but a ju&s;t reward of his fidelity to the King's &s;ervice and intere&s;t: but this cannot be, &s;ince it would only enable him to do ju&s;tice to the King, to the officers and &s;eamen of the King's navy, and to J. H's friends in Europe, who&s;e money was to be employed for the King's &s;ervice by J. H. and of which the greater part was afterwards put into the hands of R. M. for this very purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the extreme length of this memorial, we mu&s;t now further remark, that R. M. &s;eems to lay great &s;tre&s;s on the circum&s;tance of the accounts, re&s;pecting J. H's tran&s;actions in Bo&s;ton in 1778, being entered in R. M's books in 1779, at J. H's reque&s;t: He a&s;ks, (Page 13) "<HI>How are they to be &s;eparated? (i. e. from his ac|counts.) Where are your in&s;tructions for the purpo&s;e at the time?</HI> He adds, in the &s;ame Page,
<Q>The effort now made to &s;eparate them, is with a view to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h your demand of depreciation</HI>: but, although it is in that re&s;pect immaterial to me, I will not con&s;ent to it.</Q></P>
<P>This refu&s;al of R. M. is extraordinary. J. H's tran&s;actions in Bo&s;ton are perfectly di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of R. M. in Philadelphia: he never would have con&s;ented to, or could be obliged to make good any lo&s;&s;es to the King or to J. H. on J. H's operations and tran&s;actions in Bo&s;ton, in which he had no concern; which he neither advi&s;ed, di|rected or concerted. On this occa&s;ion R. M. was really a mere <HI>book-keeper</HI> to J. H. recording in the run of 1779, one part of J. H's tran&s;actions in Bo&s;ton, which took place in October and November, 1778, and which only came to R. M's knowledge in the year following, thro' the confidential communication of J. H. He was neither a banker or agent in this bu&s;ine&s;s: he was not to loo&s;e by being merely a recorder of accounts; he could not rea&s;onably have any profit in view; he could not claim or di&s;claim any depreciation thereon. Nay, page 11, he rea&s;ons on this &s;ubject in the following words:
<Q>Robert Morris, (&s;ub-agent to J. H.) accounts to the agent general of the Royal Marine. (i. e. to J. H.) John Holker, Daniel Bell, John Rowe and others, tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s on account of the Royal Marine in Bo&s;ton; the agent general makes tho&s;e gentlemen accountable to Robert Morris, (J. H. makes J. H. accountable to R. M.) by <HI>placing</HI> the accounts of tho&s;e tran&s;actions in his hands, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of introducing their accounts into his.</Q>
And further, in the &s;ame page:
<Q>If the accounts of tho&s;e gentlemen do not plea&s;e you, I care not; for I did not employ them, and in&s;erted their accounts into mine by your order.</Q></P>
<P>Here R. M. acknowledges that he did not tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s; he is not re&s;pon&s;ible for the &s;ame, for he did not employ John Holker, the agent general, nor any other of the Gentlemen; and becau&s;e he recorded their tran&s;actions in his Books, he therefore introduces their operations into the &s;tatement of his own operations, into the accounts of his own tran&s;actions: he is de&s;ired to &s;tate his own accounts &s;eparately and di&s;tinctly, to &s;pecify merely what he did actually receive and pay on the public account. And tho' he &s;ays, that with re&s;pect to depreciation, it is immaterial to him, he will not con&s;ent to do it, becau&s;e
<Q><HI>the effort now made to &s;eparate them, is with a view to e&s;tabli&s;h your demand of depreciation.</HI></Q>
As if the mere &s;eparation of &s;uch accounts, the &s;ub&s;traction of accounts where he neither received or paid one penny, could e&s;tabli&s;h or annul any claim of depreciation again&s;t him or for him.</P>
<P>Page 15, R. M. &s;ays,
<Q>But let us return for <HI>a moment</HI> to your Bo&s;ton tran&s;actions, on which &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s is laid; <HI>your</HI> mo&s;t favorable &s;tatement of them can only be, <HI>a profit made by the King on the depreciation of money be|longing to individuals,</HI> applied to his u&s;e; but this is not all; you, as I have already ob&s;erved, derived the means of making tho&s;e expenditures, principally from funds credited to individuals <HI>in accounts kept by you, in my name,</HI> at
<PB N="42" REF="044903_0043_101F4F755AF01E40">
your reque&s;t; (i. e. in R. M's books) compri&s;e the whole together and you mu&s;t &s;ee, that it forms neither ad|dition to, nor deduction from what I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>Without ob&s;erving on the ob&s;curity of the fir&s;t part of this paragraph, or on the &s;uppo&s;ed inju&s;tice of an attempt made by the agent general to make a profit for the King, or on the propriety of doing <HI>now</HI> ultimate ju&s;tice to the King or J. H's friends, let us only attend to the latter part: &mdash;compri&s;e together the whole of J. H's Bo&s;ton tran&s;|actions, they neither make addition to, nor deduction from what R. M. po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.&mdash; Why therefore not &s;eparate &s;uch unnece&s;&s;ary accounts, which can only create confu&s;ion and error, e&s;pecially in dealings with continental money; and which, when entered into R. M's accounts under different dates of receipt and payment, give ri&s;e to the mo&s;t erroneous inductions.</P>
<P>Why, therefore, is the &s;eparation of the&s;e Bo&s;ton accounts &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by R. M? The truth in this re&s;pect we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e to be, that there is exi&s;ting a very heavy lo&s;s to the King on R. M's operations in 1779; in the beginning of that year he actually received more than &pound;.20,000 &s;terling, in bills payable at the Royal trea&s;ury of France, and more than &pound;7000 &s;terling in &s;imilar bills from Me&s;&s;rs. Turnbull and Co. in the year 1780, be&s;ides very large &s;ums in continental currency, the whole for the King's account, for his &s;ervice alone; &s;till it appears from R. M's own accounts, from his own &s;tatement, made out by him&s;elf, from his books and from the vouchers he produced in &s;upport of his accounts, that he never did pay for the King's account, &pound;.12,000 Penn&s;ylvania cur|rency, of real &s;pecie value, according to the &s;cale of depreciation fixed by law; from whence there re&s;ults a lo&s;s of near &pound;.40,000 to the King, tho' he &s;old almo&s;t all the public bills him&s;elf,&mdash;made his own engagements through agents of his own choice,&mdash;made his own contracts and purcha&s;es, &amp;c. Does not &s;uch an extraordinary lo&s;s and deficiency need an inve&s;tigation? Does it not afford a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why auditors &s;hould &s;tate R. M's tran&s;|actions &s;eparately and di&s;tinctly from tho&s;e per&s;onal to J. H. where J. H. alone received and paid the monies, &s;o as to examine and report on this my&s;terious bu&s;ine&s;s; e&s;pecially as R. M. did receive monies applicable only to &s;pecial particular purpo&s;es, &s;uch as, for the public &s;ervice, for the purcha&s;e of loan office certificates, for &s;peculations in South-Carolina, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be with a view of avoiding the con&s;equences of this great deficiency, that R. M. &s;ays, page 11 and 13, that the part of the &s;tatement of the public tran&s;actions, &s;igned by his Excellency Mon&s;ieur Gerard, in Sept. 1779, <HI>was an account &s;ettled.</HI> This is a circum&s;tance &s;o remarkable, and &s;o much &s;tre&s;s is al&s;o laid thereon, that it is proper to relate what appears on record upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The &s;tatement referred to is entitled:
<Q><HI>Debtor,</HI> The Hon. John Holker, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> agent to the Royal Marine of France, in account current with Robert Morris, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Philadelphia,&mdash; on account of &s;aid Royal Marine, <HI>Creditor</HI>&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t charge in this &s;tatement, that appears under the date of the 19th of Sept. 1778, is a &s;um of &pound;.2520, for &pound;.2400, paid by R. M. to Edward Evans, on behalf of the owners and Captain of the &s;loop Supply, for &s;ervices performed to his Excellency Connt D'E&s;taing's fleet, which, with a commi&s;&s;ion of 5 per ct. for paying this money, make &pound;.2520 - 0 - 0</P>

<P>Thus &s;tands the account, <HI>&s;aid to be &s;ettled,</HI> between J. H. and R. M. in pre&s;ence of his Excellency Mon&s;ieur Gerard.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding that a very con&s;iderable part of J.

<P>Errors excepted.</P>
<P>ROBERT MORRIS."</P>
<P>The gro&s;s amount of this &s;econd &s;tatement is &pound;.1,528,119 - 14 - 2&mdash;Penn&s;ylvania currency&mdash;of continental paper: It was &s;ent to J. H. on the 26th or 27 of February, 1784, with R. M's letter of the 26th day of that month. But previous thereto, another &s;econd &s;tatement of accounts for the Royal Marine, had been handed to J. H. by which a balance in favor of R. M. of &pound;.450,000 was claimed from the Royal Marine: this la&s;t was made out in 1781, and R. M. &s;ays, page 8&mdash;<HI>the accounts of the continental commi&s;&s;aries</HI> (from whence it was &s;tated) <HI>were only de|livered to me about the middle of</HI> May, 1781.</P>
<P>From what has now been related, will it not be ea&s;y for any one to an&s;wer, whether R. M's fir&s;t &s;tatement of the public matters is <HI>an account &s;ettled</HI> between the parties? Other documents will prove, that it never could be, nor ever was intended by the parties as a &s;ettlement. What then does R. M. mean by maintaining that it was an account &s;ettled? Surely he cannot intend thereby to prove that his accounts cannot be &s;eparated from tho&s;e of J. H. for he, of his own accord, &s;eparates the public from the private concerns.</P>
<P>This riddle will be be&s;t explained thus: He wi&s;hes to make J. H. believe that the principles of the account may be deemed &s;ettled, though not one word is &s;aid thereon; he wi&s;hes this fir&s;t &s;tatement had been really &s;ettled as to all claim of depreciation; and as this may be maintained before auditors, it would appear to be incumbent on them to
<PB N="45" REF="044903_0046_101F4F7E280479F0">
&s;tate all R. M's accounts di&s;tinctly and &s;eparately, under their real dates in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, before they conde&s;cend to hear the parties on their di&s;putes, differences, or contentions, in order thereby to under&s;tand well what may be &s;aid, and to a&s;certain clearly the truth and the whole truth of this unfortunate bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>In order to prove the nece&s;&s;ity of admitting the principles of depreciation on his accounts, we mu&s;t here relate &s;ome further facts.</P>
<P>A gentleman of high tru&s;t, and of honorable memory, employed R. M. as his confidential agent in various con|cerns, during the years 1779 and 1780&mdash;to him he accounted for the outfits of ve&s;&s;els, and the proceeds of return cargoes on a footing of depreciation.</P>
<P>Swanwick, the clerk, attorney, agent and at pre&s;ent the partner of R. M. was employed during two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years with full powers of attorney from R. M. in &s;ettling, claiming &s;ettlements, and offering them to all concerned, on a valuation, or &s;cale of depreciation, on behalf of his employer. R. M. when employed as a banker, as a depo&s;itary of money merely, when he has paid continental money on account of depo&s;its made with him in hard money, he has valued the&s;e payments according to the &s;cale at the time of payment. When employed as banker he admits of de|preciation to every one but to J. H.&mdash;when employed by J. H. as <HI>agent,</HI> to tran&s;act upon tru&s;t immen&s;e purcha&s;es of provi&s;ions and &s;tores, to &s;ell prizes, &amp;c. &amp;c. he admits no principle of depreciation, becau&s;e, he &s;ays, he was only banker and depo&s;itary. When J. H. is intere&s;ted in &s;ome unfortunate expedition to &s;ea by his agent, and the &s;hip and cargo fall into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy, then the expenditures and outfits are all reduced, by &s;ome &s;cale or other to a &s;pecie value, and the amount in &s;pecie is charged again&s;t J. H. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide the accounts of the &s;hip Defence, fitted out by Wm. Smith, of Baltimore, Maryland&mdash;in the run of 1779, and for which a balance of &pound;.2400 &s;pecie, is charged again&s;t J. H.</NOTE> in a &s;pecial particular &s;pecie account. But when adventures are &s;omewhat more pro&s;perous, then the proceeds of the return cargoes, &s;old by R. M. or his corre&s;pondents, are only to be accounted for nominally in a large, grand, nominal account, where &s;ums appear mag|nificent in number or in found, but whence the reality is to be &s;ub&s;tracted for the benefit of the accomptant;&mdash;for the proceeds of the&s;e cargoes are, collectively with the monies of Holker's friends, to form one general balance, which alone is to be accounted for on that rate of depreciation which it plea&s;es R. M. to fix upon, according to his ideas of what is ju&s;t, right and honorable. And therefore he offers the balance due in April, 1780, at the exchange of that month; though it re&s;ults from a long cour&s;e of tran&s;actions, from July 1777, to April 1780, during the cour&s;e of his agency for J. H. and J. H's ab&s;ent friends.</P>
<P>We will now put a period to the&s;e ob&s;ervations, and leave the re&s;t to the deci&s;ion of law and equity&mdash;Relying on our own integrity, the fairne&s;s and importance of our claims, and the efficacy and uprightne&s;s of the laws, we can entertain no doubt of obtaining ample and &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice.</P>
