<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Senate, and Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with the reque&s;t in one of the re&s;o|lutions of Congre&s;s, of the 21&s;t of December la&s;t, I tran&s;mitted a copy of tho&s;e re&s;olutions by my Secretary, Mr. Shaw, to Mrs. Wa&s;hington, a&s;&s;uring her of the profound re&s;pect Congre&s;s will ever bear to her per|&s;on and character&mdash;of their condolence in the late af|flicting di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence, and entreating her a&s;&s;ent to the interment of the remains of General GEORGE WASHINGTON, in the manner expre&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t re&s;olution. As the &s;entiments of that virtuous lady, not le&s;s beloved by this nation than &s;he is at pre|&s;ent greatly afflicted, can never be &s;o well expre&s;&s;ed as in her own words, I tran&s;mit to Congre&s;s her origi|nal letter.</P>
<P>It would be an attempt of too much delicacy, to make any comments upon it; but, there can be no doubt, that the nation at large, as well as all the branches of the government, will be highly gratified by any ar|rangement which may dimini&s;h the &s;acrifice &s;he makes of her individual feelings.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE I feel with keene&s;t angui&s;h the late di&s;|pen&s;ation of Divine Providence, I cannot be in&s;en&s;ible to the mournful tributes of re&s;pect and veneration, which are paid to the memory of my dear decea&s;ed hu&s;band; and, as his be&s;t &s;ervices, and mo&s;t anxious wi&s;hes were always devoted to the welfare and happi|ne&s;s of his country, to know that they were truly ap|preciated and gratefully remembered, affords no incon|&s;iderable con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Taught by the great example which I have &s;o long had before me, never to oppo&s;e my private wi&s;hes to the public will, I mu&s;t con&s;ent to the reque&s;t made by Congre&s;s, which you have had the goodne&s;s to tran&s;|mit to me; and, in doing this I need not, I cannot &s;ay, what a &s;acrifice of individual feeling I make to a &s;en&s;e of public duty.</P>
<P>With grateful acknowledgments, and unfeigned thanks for the per&s;onal re&s;pect, and evidences of con|dolence expre&s;&s;ed by Congre&s;s, and your&s;elf,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I remain very re&s;pectfully, Sir, Your mo&s;t obedient humble &s;ervant,  MARTHA WASHINGTON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
