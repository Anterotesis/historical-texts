<HEAD>THE HUBBUB, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE olde&s;t man living at Comp|ton-A&s;hby, cannot call to mind &s;uch another Hubbub as that which happened there &s;ome months ago, on the common, ju&s;t before the poor|hou&s;e door. A number of men, wo|men, and children, had formed a ring round one farmer Ru&s;&s;el, a &s;ullen, down looking fellow, whom no one loved, and every one feared: for his love of money had led him to be hard|hearted, and his power over the poor
<PB N="4" REF="037162_0003_100CD61574CAD0F8">
had made him in&s;olent. Never was there &s;uch a hi&s;&s;ing and hooting, and hallooing heard. Many of the&s;e peo|ple had been grievou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed by the farmer, and now they had him in their power, they &s;eemed re&s;olved to &s;hew him little mercy.</P>
<P>Betty Jobbins beat the frying-pan with the key of the door, Sally Gore pounded the pe&s;tle and mortar, Nelly Shep&s;ton rung the warming pan, Dick Devon&s;hire blew the Ram's-horn, whil&s;t Nick Stafford and others gin|gled the &s;heep's bells.</P>
<P>It &s;o happened that one Mr. Brit|ton rode up at the in&s;tant to enquire what was the matter, of two poor women who were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the porch of the poor-hou&s;e. One of them, Amy Talbot, &s;eemed to be about &s;ix|ty years of age, but time had not cu|red Amy of go&s;&s;iping, or taught her
<PB N="5" REF="037162_0004_100CD618ED3A1C18">
to mend her cloaths. As &s;he had no turn for indu&s;try in her youth, &s;he &s;oon eat, and drank up the little pro|perty left her by her parents, which might now have afforded her a com|fortable maintenance&punc; but no, Amy's tongue was always abu&s;ive and al|ways bu&s;y, whil&s;t her fingers were &s;eldom employed. Wherever there was a go&s;&s;iping in the pari&s;h, thither ran Amy with her rags flying about her, like a &s;care-crow in a cherry tree. Her &s;kin, which was quite tawny, was never wa&s;hed; her hair had work|ed it&s;elf through the holes of her mob, half the border of which was lo&s;t, and the flaps of it were always flying behind her; the pigs had one day eaten a hole through her hat as it lay on the ground, and a piece of it now hung over her eye like a black patch, her petticoats were all tatters, and her gown reached but little below her knees; it had been torn away bit
<PB N="6" REF="037162_0005_100CDE9440B01DF0">
by bit, till it was ravelled out to the above dimen&s;ions; her &s;tockings had no feet, and her feet were &s;lipped in|to a mi&s;erable pair of &s;hoes, which &s;he had not taken the trouble to draw up at he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, even when they were new; in one hand &s;he clenched her rags together, whil&s;t with the other, &s;he held a &s;hort pipe in her mouth re&s;t|ing her elbow on her knee, as &s;he &s;at cro&s;s legged.</P>
<P>The other poor woman who&s;e name was Ap&s;ley, was of a very dif|ferent ca&s;t from Amy; &s;he was the picture of cleanline&s;s, and good hou&s;e|wifery; &s;he was mending her apron, which though very coar&s;e, was as white as the driven &s;now; this good woman never &s;at at the door to take the air, but &s;he was doing &s;omething; "it is a duty," &s;he would &s;ay, "to turn our time to the be&s;t account we
<PB N="7" REF="037162_0006_100CDE970D607BF8">
can," and when her other employ|ment was over &s;he would read a chap|ter in her Bible. Mr. Britton a&s;ked her what occa&s;ioned the uproar, and at the &s;ame time &s;lipped half a crown into her hand, giving afterwards a few halfpence to Amy, which he thought was more than &s;uch a dirty woman de&s;erved.</P>
<P>"Why, &s;ir," cried Amy pocket|ing her pence, "I'll tell you all how and about it; don't you &s;ee that &s;ulky ill-looking fellow of a farmer &s;o hoot|ed at by the people? he is a fine rare cru&s;ty old blade, and has hectored over the pari&s;h at a fine rate; he is always at law with the Par&s;on about tithes, and with his neighbours upon the &s;lighte&s;t provocation; be&s;ides, Sir, he is Over&s;eer of the poor, and a poor time we have had on't, but thanks be prai&s;ed, 'tis come home to the wretch at la&s;t," then &s;he fell to hooting and
<PB N="8" REF="037162_0007_100CDE98ADBC7B18">
hi&s;&s;ing, till &s;he foamed at the mouth again; which having wiped off with the corner of her gown, &s;he &s;aid, "now, Sir, I'll tell you: that fellow's &s;tomach has been well filled with eve|ry thing of the be&s;t, whil&s;t he has &s;tar|ved poor we almo&s;t to death, but 'tis likely to come home to him at la&s;t, and he may chance to &s;wing for it, and then we &s;hall all be revenged of him," and again &s;he fell to clapping her hands.</P>
<P>"Prithee Amy;" replied dame Ap|&s;ley very calmly, "don't give way to &s;uch evil tempers; we have been hard|ly u&s;ed by the farmer to be &s;ure, but if we are chri&s;tians, we mu&s;t learn to forget and forgive," "If ever I forgive the villain," cried Amy, knock|ing the du&s;t out of her pipe, "may I never get another quartern of tobac|co; revenge is &s;weet, Sir, revenge is &s;weet."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037162_0008_100CDE9A64592918">
"To an unchri&s;tian temper I grant it is," &s;aid Mr. Britton, "but revenge is the wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ion that can enter the human brea&s;t, it is the very &s;pirit of Satan."</P>
<P>"It is a very fine remark truly, Sir," &s;aid dame Ap&s;ley, "for to my thinking, a man who is always nur|&s;ing up an evil pa&s;&s;ion in his bo&s;om, is as if he cheri&s;hed a &s;erpent there, which mu&s;t &s;ting him to death at la&s;t; yet, Sir, I mu&s;t be bold to &s;ay, much as I want money, I would not accept of farmer Ru&s;&s;el's fortune if I mu&s;t take up the heavy burden of his crimes into the bargain." Ah! dame, dame," interrupted Amy, "preach as you plea&s;e, I am glad at heart 'tis come home to the villain at la&s;t, things can't go on wor&s;e with us."</P>
<P>'Nor perhaps much better," an|&s;w'red dame Ap&s;ley, "for, after all,
<PB N="10" REF="037162_0009_100CDE9D435BF470">
'tis a very unthankful office to have much to do with poor people, e&s;peci|ally if they have not the fear of God before their eyes; becau&s;e then they are abu&s;ive and ungrateful to tho&s;e who are guardians over them; for the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ter of that, Amy, have we not &s;everal old people in this poor hou&s;e, who have been drunken, idle, bla&s;|pheming people all their lives: and though we live &s;o near to the church, not one of them has &s;een the in&s;ide of it for many years pa&s;t, unle&s;s when there has been Chri&s;tmas gifts, or mo|ney to be given away; but I think if I were the par&s;on, Amy, every Lord's day I would drive the whole po&s;&s;e in|to church before me, if they were able to &s;et one foot before another." "My good woman," &s;aid Mr. Brit|ton, "I am mightily plea&s;ed to &s;ee how u&s;efully you employ your time, for you have continued your work
<PB N="11" REF="037162_0010_100CDE9ED815F078">
ever &s;ince we have been chatting to|gether." "Time, Sir, is the gift of God, and I mu&s;t account to him for it; be&s;ides, Sir, often when I am bu|&s;ily employed at my needle, I can ponder on &s;ome text of Scripture; and I can &s;ay with King David, "As for me, when I am poor and in heavine&s;s, thy help, O God, &s;hall lift me up." Now, Sir, although I am very poor, that is no rea&s;on why I &s;hould not be very clean; if my cloathing be coar&s;e, that is no excu&s;e for its being ragged, and if I am lame in my feet, that is no cau&s;e for my fingers being idle; be&s;ides, Sir, a &s;titch in time &s;aves nine, and I frequently get a &s;hilling by mending &s;tays, or quilting of &s;ervants' petticoats, when my health will per|mit."</P>
<P>"Ah! well," interrupted Amy, "I never had the heart to work, un|le&s;s
<PB N="12" REF="037162_0011_100CDEA09B194180">
le&s;s I were better paid for it. But I &s;ay dame; I will &s;ay, that I am glad at heart farmer Ru&s;&s;el is in hold at la&s;t; "live, and let live," is my noti|on of the thing; but no, he went on from day to day, cribbing and &s;cra|ping &s;omething out of every body; and no &s;ooner did he get a little up|pi&s;h in the world, than he took no more account of poor we, than if we had been &s;o many hedge-hogs, for all he was born and bred among&s;t us; but for the matter of that, he han't been much kinder to his own family, for you mu&s;t know, Sir, his bitter tem|per cau&s;ed his only &s;on to run away from him, nor has any tale or tidings ever been heard of him." Here again A|my began hi&s;&s;ing and hooting the far|mer, in&s;omuch, that Mr. Britton began to think he &s;hould never get at the end of the &s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="037162_0012_100CDEA31D6976F8">
"Now, Sir," cried Amy at la&s;t, whil&s;t &s;he filled her pipe, "now I have got breath again, I'll tell you all how and about it. You mu&s;t know la&s;t hard winter, Sir, when bread was &s;o dear, and coals were &s;o &s;carce, farmer Ru&s;|&s;el would not let the pari&s;h be at the expence of mending the thatch on our hou&s;e, &s;o that when the &s;now melted, it ran in &s;treams down on dame's bed, by which &s;he lo&s;t the u&s;e of her limbs, and &s;he has hobbled with crutches ever &s;ince: yet &s;he, fool|i&s;h woman, &s;eldom complains; but off &s;he goes to her Bible for comfort, as a|nother body would to a gla&s;s of gin, or a pot of beer, when things go ami&s;s."</P>
<P>"The troubles of life," &s;aid Dame Ap&s;ley, "are but as &s;hadows which pa&s;s away; but the chri&s;tian's re&s;t will be eternal; and certain I am, Sir, my weak nature would often have gi|ven way to &s;inful murmurings, but
<PB N="14" REF="037162_0013_100CDEA540041AC8">
for the gracious promi&s;e, of better things in the life to come." O! Sir," continued &s;he, "I have found it much more for my &s;oul's good to ble&s;s Hea|ven for what I have, than to murmur for what I have not; though, to be &s;ure, I have &s;een better days," wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron.</P>
<P>"Indeed has &s;he, Sir," cried Amy, "for dame's hu&s;band was a man well to pa&s;s in the world; he rented a &s;mall farm, and was accounted one of the mo&s;t indu&s;trious men in the coun|try; and as to dame her&s;elf, up early and down late was her maxim when all of a &s;udden comes that knavi&s;h &s;coundrel there, farmer Ru&s;&s;el, and takes farmer Ap&s;ley's e&s;tate over his head, who was &s;oon after obliged to take up with day-labouring to maintain his family: by-and-by &s;ickne&s;s came on,
<PB N="15" REF="037162_0014_100CDEA6D4CB9FA8">
want followed next, farmer Ru&s;&s;el &s;ei|zed farmer Ap&s;ley's goods for a little debt, and at the end of a long fit of &s;ickne&s;s, he and his whole family were brought here to the poor-hou&s;e, where the man &s;oon after died of a broken heart; and yet, Sir, dame is for for|giving the farmer all this."</P>
<P>"That I do," replied &s;he, "&s;ince my ble&s;&s;ed Saviour not only forgave his enemies; but prayed to his Hea|venly Father to forgive them al&s;o; and I &s;hould read my Bible to little profit, Amy, if I learnt nothing from &s;o bright an example; but, good Sir," &s;aid &s;he, turning to Mr. Britton, "your patience mu&s;t be quite tired, not to be yet made acquainted with all the Hub|bub yonder; but mo&s;t folks are &s;o fond of telling their own &s;tories, that they do not think of other people. There is, Sir, a poor &s;oldier found
<PB N="16" REF="037162_0015_100CDEA94B0E9CB8">
dead this morning in the next pari&s;h, and it is thought that farmer Ru&s;&s;el has had &s;ome concern in the matter, &s;o the people are now going to carry him before a ju&s;tice to be examined."</P>
<P>"And I hope he will be hanged, I hope he will be hanged," cried Amy, clapping her hands,"&mdash;"and I hope he will live to repent," cried dame Ap&s;ley, wiping her eyes. Mr. Brit|ton's curio&s;ity was now rai&s;ed, and he attended the mob to the ju&s;tice's.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice Carter was an upright gen|tleman, ju&s;t &s;uch a man as a ju&s;tice of the peace ought to be. Before he admini&s;tered an oath to an ignorant per&s;on; "Think a moment, my friend," he would &s;ay, "before you ki&s;s this book, whether you can &s;tand to the truth of what you are going to &s;wear, when you are called to be judged for
<PB N="17" REF="037162_0016_100CDEAB76274FD0">
it, before the God of Heaven and earth." No temptation could ever prevail on his wor&s;hip unju&s;tly to fa|vour any man: the laws, he &s;aid, mu&s;t take their cour&s;e; if they were found &s;evere, he did not make them: it was his duty to admini&s;ter them.</P>
<P>"And, plea&s;e your wor&s;hip," cri|ed one Jones, who &s;eemed to be the ring-leader of the mob," "we all hope that you will now take revenge for us on the farmer, for all the &s;pite|ful tricks he has played us."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould make but an ill u&s;e of power, Jones" replied the ju&s;tice, "if I were to do any thing from heat or pa&s;&s;ion; if the law acquits farmer Ru&s;&s;el, I &s;hall readily di&s;mi&s;s him."</P>
<P>"Well, to be &s;ure," cried the peo|ple all in a breath, "your Wor&s;hip
<PB N="18" REF="037162_0017_100CDEAE16063EA0">
mu&s;t be a very fine Chri&s;tian to for|get and forgive at this rate, for to our certain knowledge the farmer has been a plague to you your&s;elf the&s;e ten years, &s;neering at you many times, and &s;aying, that neither you nor the law could take hold of him." "Now, do not you &s;ee," "replied the ju&s;tice," "that all that has no|thing to do with the pre&s;ent matter?"</P>
<P>Then turning over a great book as big as a church bible, the witne&s;s was called, who depo&s;ed upon oath, that the la&s;t evening ju&s;t between light and dark, he &s;aw farmer Ru&s;&s;el dragging a poor &s;oldier-like looking man over Compton bridge, clear out of his own pari&s;h into the next, that he there laid him down by the &s;ide of the ditch; that at fir&s;t he the witne&s;s, believed the man to be dead; but that in a &s;hort time he found the poor fellow had only fainted through weakne&s;s;
<PB N="19" REF="037162_0018_100CDEAFCC7F8238">
that the witne&s;s had lent the poor &s;ol|dier all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power; but that he was obliged &s;oon after to follow his cattle.</P>
<P>Here the witne&s;s's evidence clo&s;ed. "And could you," &s;aid the ju&s;tice to farmer Ru&s;&s;el, "drag a poor dying tra|veller out of your pari&s;h in this barba|rous manner? In order to &s;ave your own pari&s;h a trifling expence, you did not &s;cruple to ri&s;k the life of this poor traveller. You thought indeed, that the darkne&s;s concealed you; but remember, though it &s;eemed dark, yet the broad eye of the Almighty was upon you.</P>
<P>The farmer then in a &s;urly tone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eplied, that the man had no bu&s;ine&s;s in his pari&s;h, and that as for him&s;elf, no one could &s;ay he was unkind to the poor, for he paid three times as
<PB N="20" REF="037162_0019_100CDEB24D3C8108">
much to the poor-rates as any man in the pari&s;h, (the lord of the manor only excepted) "And rea&s;on good," cried ragged Amy," who had follow|ed the mob; "becau&s;e you are the greate&s;t renter in it; for by di&s;hone&s;t practices you have got all the &s;mall farms into your own hands; but far|mer; no one has heard you ever gave a penny out of your own pocket to the poor when the laws did not com|pel you, &s;o no thanks for your cha|rity. And plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip, eve|very one here knows, that whenever a kind gentleman and lady &s;ent a few &s;hillings to be divided among&s;t us, if the farmer heard of it he would &s;top our pay till it was gone."</P>
<P>Both the Ju&s;tice and Mr. Britton quite &s;huddered at this act of cruelty, and every one pre&s;ent hoped his Wor|&s;hip would not fail to take ample re|venge on the farmer.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="037162_0020_100CDEB463B5A1D0">
"My friends," &s;aid the Ju&s;tice again, "if my brea&s;t harboured re|venge again&s;t any man, I &s;hould be unfit for a magi&s;trate; did you never &s;ee the picture of Ju&s;tice painted in my great hall? &s;he is there repre&s;ent|ed as holding a pair of &s;cales with the balance quite even."</P>
<P>The Ju&s;tice wi&s;hing to know &s;ome more circum&s;tances about the man's death, the whole po&s;&s;e now moved off to the place where the corp&s;e lay, at|tended by Mr. Britton; by the way they accu&s;ed the farmer of eve|ry crime; &s;ome of which he had not, and others which he had commit|ted. "Ah!" &s;aid one, "who &s;old cider for the very be&s;t, when it was proved it had been half filled up with water?" "Who," &s;aid another, "&s;old his hay-ricks, all warranted good, and when they were cut open
<PB N="22" REF="037162_0021_100CDEB66C554228">
they were found crammed with mu&s;ty &s;tuff, fit only for littering cattle?" "And who," cried a third, "carried the be&s;t &s;amples of wheat to the mar|ket, and afterwards fobbed the buy|er off with the very wor&s;t?" "And who," bawled out a fourth, "turn|ed his own child out of doors, and mayhap murdered him, for no ti|dings have been heard of him &s;ince?"</P>
<P>Much after this manner they went on, and &s;oon after the coroner pro|nounced a verdict of <HI>natural death,</HI> no marks of violence being found up|on the body. The farmer now bright|ened up at once, and, &s;ticking his hands in his wai&s;tcoat pockets, he ca&s;t a malignant grin of triumph on all around him; "Now touch me if you dare," cried he, "but if my name be Ru&s;&s;el, I'll have my revenge of every man and woman's child of you;
<PB N="23" REF="037162_0022_100CDEB86D063AD8">
and I'll lay an action again&s;t you, John Ho&s;kins, for defamation; you have accu&s;ed me with the murder of my own child; now prove your words if you can." Poor Ho&s;kins turned as pale as death, well knowing the far|mer's unforgiving temper.</P>
<P>Here &s;ome one &s;earching the pock|ets of the decea&s;ed, was &s;urprized to find in them a letter not &s;ealed, direct|ed to farmer Ru&s;&s;el, of Compton A&s;h|by. The letter was offered to the farmer, but he refu&s;ed to take it, ha|ving always thought it unlucky to touch any thing belonging to the dead. For the cruel are naturally &s;uper&s;titious. The people then reque&s;ted Mr. Brit|ton to read it aloud, which he at length con&s;ented to do.</P>

<P>I have faithfully &s;erved his Maje&s;ty King George in his wars for many years; but falling into the &s;ame di&s;order of which my poor mother died, the con&s;umption; my commanding officer who has be|haved like a father to me, has kind|ly granted me a furlow, to try what my native air will do for me, giving me at the &s;ame time a golden guinea out of his own pocket to bear my ex|pences on the road, he having always taken a great fancy to me, &s;eeing as how, I ever made it my delight to obey him. So I began my match homeward, although with great fear and trembling, pondering in my mind
<PB N="26" REF="037162_0025_100CDEBF4ABB8348">
the la&s;t words I ever heard you &s;peak; which were, 'That you wi&s;hed I might drop down dead if I ever da|red to darken your doors again;' and calling down heavy cur&s;es on your&s;elf if ever you forgave me; and now, as my offence, dear father, was but a &s;light, one, and much have I repented of it, and much &s;hall we all have to be forgiven when we &s;hall appear before God in judgement, &s;o I humbly tru&s;t you will receive me kindly when you &s;ee how &s;ick, and how very weak I am.

I therefore write the&s;e few lines from the Swan at Bridge|water, where I have &s;topped, in order that they may, in ca&s;e I &s;hould not be able to reach home alive, be &s;ent to you after my death. Oh, my dear father! my hour gla&s;s is almo&s;t run, and death will now be welcome to me,
<PB N="27" REF="037162_0026_100CDEC0DF325018">
for my life has been little el&s;e than pain and &s;orrow. O! father, nothing becomes a chri&s;tian-man like &s;orrow for &s;in, even when he is found in health, and his worldly concerns flouri&s;hing round him. Pray, dear father, think of the&s;e things. Al|though this life is nearly over with me, yet I have a comfortable hope and tru&s;t in my Saviour that the joys of the next will &s;oon open upon me.</P>
<P>"Farewell, for ever, my dear and honoured father: &s;hould we meet no more in this world, I humbly pray we may meet in the next. I beg pardon for all my faults, and with my dying breath &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf, your ever dutiful &s;on,</P>

<P>Many tears were &s;hed whil&s;t Mr.

Britton read the letter. "My good friends," &s;aid he, when he had fini&s;h|ed it. "let me now give you a word of advice: Whenever a &s;ick and poor traveller, (and e&s;pecially when a brave &s;oldier or &s;ailor, who has &s;hed his blood in fighting for you in foreign parts, and is perhaps e&s;caped from an enemy's pri&s;on,) knocks at your door to a&s;k for charity, do not refu&s;e him a cup of beer, or a plentiful &s;lice of bread and chee&s;e: to you who a|bound it is little, to him it may be much; and henceforward let us all learn to look upon every man in di&s;|tre&s;s as a child or a brother; and let us do by him as we would wi&s;h to be done by, if we were in his condition. As for you, farmer Ru&s;&s;el," continu|ed he, "no reproof from me is want|ing, for the event that has happened is of it&s;elf the mo&s;t bitter of all re|proofs."</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="037162_0028_100CDEC5DA9CBE80">
"O my &s;on! my &s;on!" at length cried the farmer, wringing his hands, and tearing his hair with grief, "my own cur&s;es have brought on my own de&s;truction! Wretch! wretch that I am," here attempting to ri&s;e, he &s;unk down by the body of his &s;on, and then fell into &s;uch &s;trong convul&s;ion fits, that &s;ix of the &s;toute&s;t men pre|&s;ent could not hold him&punc; his limbs were di&s;torted, his face turned black, his eyes looked as if they were bur&s;t|ing out of his head; &s;o dreadful in|deed was his &s;ituation, that tho&s;e who but a moment before hated and revi|led him, were now ready to pity him. "What an affecting &s;ight," &s;aid Mr. Britton "have we now before us! God grant that it may prove a le&s;&s;on to us all. It was but a few moments ago that this mi&s;erable man, who now lies &s;truggling in the toils of death before you, was proudly rejoi|cing
<PB N="30" REF="037162_0029_100CDEC7EBFE9A90">
that he had e&s;caped the la&s;h of the law."</P>
<P>The farmer's waggon now arrived to carry him home, and it was a mo&s;t moving &s;ight, to &s;ee it followed by the corp&s;e of his &s;on. A doctor was &s;ent for, who the moment he &s;aw the farmer, &s;aid he feared he could do no|thing for him. Mr. Britton watched by him all night, and when the fits went off for a few minutes, he was heard thus to mutter to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Of what u&s;e to me are all the riches in the world, now the afflicting hand of Heaven is upon me? My puni&s;hment is great, great al&s;o has been my crime.&mdash;I &s;uffered my own child to peri&s;h for want, whil&s;t I was in plenty, and now my own hand has helped to kill him; how hard have I been to the poor; the Lord has
<PB N="31" REF="037162_0030_100CDEC983686020">
&s;mitten me for it! The cur&s;es I have often uttered again&s;t them are now come upon my&s;elf. I mu&s;t die! The jaws of Hell &s;eem opening to devour me!"</P>
<P>After this the farmer uttered no|thing to be under&s;tood, though he langui&s;hed near three weeks in a &s;tate of mi&s;ery which excited the pity of all who &s;aw him, and then expired, a dreadful in&s;tance of the ju&s;t judgment of God.</P>

<HEAD>THE LADY AND THE PYE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A WORTHY Squire of &s;ober life,</L>
<L>Had a conceited boa&s;ting wife;</L>
<L>Of <HI>him</HI> &s;he daily made complaint;</L>
<L><HI>Herself</HI> &s;he thought a very &s;aint.</L>
<L>She lov'd to load mankind with blame,</L>
<L>And on their errors build her fame.</L>
<L>Her favourite &s;ubject of di&s;pute</L>
<L>Was Eve and the forbidden fruit.</L>
<L>"Had I been Eve," &s;he often cried,</L>
<L>"Man had not fall'n, nor woman died;</L>
<L>I &s;till had kept the orders given,</L>
<L>Nor for an apple lo&s;t my heaven;</L>
<L>To gratify my curious mind</L>
<L>I ne'er had ruin'd all mankind;</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="037162_0032_100CDECEDF9DC000">
Nor from a vain de&s;ire to know,</L>
<L>Entail'd on all my race &s;uch woe."</L>

<L>The Squire reply'd, "I fear 'tis true,</L>
<L>The &s;ame ill &s;pirit lives in you;</L>
<L>Tempted alike, I dare believe,</L>
<L>You would have di&s;obey'd like Eve&punc;"</L>
<L>The lady &s;torm'd and &s;till deny'd</L>
<L>Both curio&s;ity and pride.</L>

<L>The Squire &s;ome future day at dinner,</L>
<L>Re&s;olv'd to try this boa&s;tful &s;inner;</L>
<L>He griev'd &s;uch vanity po&s;&s;e&s;t her,</L>
<L>And thus in &s;erious terms addre&s;s'd her:</L>
<L>"Madam, the u&s;ual &s;plendid fea&s;t</L>
<L>With which our wedding day is grac'd,</L>
<L>With you I mu&s;t not &s;hare to-day,</L>
<L>For bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ummons me away.</L>
<L>Of all the dainties I've prepar'd,</L>

<L>Enjoy, 'tis what I really wi&s;h&punc;</L>
<L>Only ob&s;erve one prohibition&punc;</L>
<L>Nor think it a &s;evere condition;</L>
<L>On one &s;mall di&s;h which cover'd &s;tands,</L>

<L>The treat was &s;erv'd, the Squire was gone,</L>

<L>Or charm the eye, or plea&s;e the ta&s;te;</L>

<L>From ven'&s;on haunch to turtle fat;</L>
<L>On one &s;mall di&s;h &s;he chanc'd to light,</L>

<L>"O! here it is&mdash;yet not for me!</L>
<L>I mu&s;t not ta&s;te, nay dare not &s;ee;</L>
<L>Why place it there? or why forbid</L>
<L>That I &s;o much as lift the lid?</L>
<L>Prohibited of this to eat,</L>

<L>John you may go&mdash;the wine's decanted,</L>
