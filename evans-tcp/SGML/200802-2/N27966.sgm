<P>Many pieces of compo&s;ition, may an&s;wer well enough for the ha&s;ty manner, in which they generally are recited; but which, however, are by no means proper to be committed to the pre&s;s: becau&s;e their faults are thus render|ed permanent; which, in the former in&s;tance, were generally forgotten as &s;oon as made public.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE unexpected honour you have conferred upon me, in appointing me to deliver your annual oration, could not fail of being highly grateful to my feelings, and would na|turally impel me to the &s;tronge&s;t acknowledg|ments, for this di&s;tingui&s;hed mark of your ap|probation and e&s;teem. But, whil&s;t I avow tho&s;e feelings which your conduct has awakened; per|mit me al&s;o to &s;ay, I cannot contemplate this re&s;pected a&s;&s;embly without regret, when I con|&s;ider how many gentlemen, better qualified to do ju&s;tice to the appointment, are now before me. I can, however, confidently a&s;&s;ert, that there is no one pre&s;ent, who&s;e wi&s;hes for the pro&s;perity of our in&s;titution exceed my own. Its pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing &s;tate, cannot fail of giving plea&s;ure to all who have its welfare at heart; whil&s;t the indu&s;try and application of its mem|bers, are the &s;ure&s;t pledges of its continuation and increa&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037264_0007_100CA31DB78F34A0">
The difficulty of chu&s;ing a &s;ubject for an oration, did not occur, at the time of my accept|ance of the charge committed to me. Had I been equally &s;en&s;ible of it then, as I am at pre|&s;ent; nothing would have induced me to ac|cede to your wi&s;hes, but a thorough convic|tion, that each member owes it to our &s;ociety, to comply with every re&s;olve in which he may be concerned, to the extent of his abilities. This difficulty in the choice of a &s;ubject, ari&s;es from the nece&s;&s;ity of its being general in its na|ture; and yet, at the &s;ame time, &s;o connected with the &s;cience of Medicine, as to render it in &s;ome mea&s;ure tributary thereto. From this cau&s;e it mo&s;tly happens, that a deficiency of matter is made up by a luxuriance of &s;tyle, and fertility of imagination; which, although they do not tend to the in&s;truction of the au|dience; yet they gratify the mind, by affording a temporary amu&s;ement. Under this impre&s;&s;i|on, and without expecting to add much, either to your in&s;truction or amu&s;ement; I mu&s;t beg your indulgence, whil&s;t I take a &s;hort view, of the <HI>importance</HI> and <HI>re&s;pectability</HI> of the SCIENCE OF MEDICINE, as demon&s;trated by the extent of its re&s;earches; and by the univer|&s;al homage which has ever been paid to it, by all ranks and conditions of men; even by tho&s;e who, in health, affect to ridicule and de&s;pi&s;e it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037264_0008_100CA320C8B460D8">
This ridicule, the offspring generally of little minds, although highly unju&s;t and illiberal, we are not to be &s;urpri&s;ed at, when we con&s;ider, how great an opening is given to it by the un|fortunate di&s;putes and di&s;&s;entions of the Facul|ty them&s;elves. The intere&s;ts of the profe&s;&s;ion are lo&s;t, in the di&s;graceful employment of per&s;onal invective, or of malicious and &s;landerous hints. The errors of individuals are rancorou&s;ly ren|dered con&s;picuous to the public eye; and this is often done without any attention to the voice of truth. The unkind con&s;tructions, and ill-timed remarks, of fellow-practitioners, cannot fail of being a great &s;ource of that degrading light in which Medicine is often held by man|kind. The&s;e unhappy jealou&s;ies and animo&s;ities, frequently prove of the wor&s;t con&s;equences to patients. We have &s;een them carried to their highe&s;t pitch among&s;t our&s;elves; and, I fear with the mo&s;t fatal i&s;&s;ue to our fellow citizens: for, as the&s;e quarrels do not &s;top here, but extend them&s;elves to the public; a diver&s;ity of opinion prevails, which ultimately undermines all con|fidence in the profe&s;&s;ion; and prevents any ap|plication for advice, until that period has elap|&s;ed, in which alone, the powers of medicine might have proved efficacious. By this di&s;union, phy&s;icians lo&s;e the advantages ari&s;ing from mu|tual communication, and from the confidence which is acquired in their opinions, by the con|currence
<PB N="8" REF="037264_0009_100CA322524736E8">
of each other. Opinions, however, unfortunately, are not regarded according to their intrin&s;ic m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rit; but according to the per|&s;on from whom they proceed; and propo&s;als, delivered with openne&s;s, are often whi&s;pered abroad, and mi&s;repre&s;ented to the public, with|out any regard to honour and &s;ecre&s;y. The&s;e quarrels, &s;ometimes ending in appeals to the public, tend &s;till further to heighten the animo&s;|ity, and widen the breach; and generally in|jure the contending parties, by making them objects of ridicule to the world: Added to this, they di&s;credit the profe&s;&s;ion, and expo&s;e the whole Faculty to contempt. They al&s;o may be regarded as one powerful cau&s;e of the intro|duction of emperics; who dimini&s;h the practice of the regular phy&s;ician. When &s;o little re|&s;pect for each other, appears to exi&s;t among&s;t members of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion; it is &s;carcely a &s;ubject of wonder, if the public &s;hould al&s;o dive&s;t them&s;elves of it; unacquainted as they are, with the many difficulties attendant upon the practice of phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>In all ages, much wit has been di&s;played upon our profe&s;&s;ion: A &s;light attention, however, will &s;hew, that the ridicule has been employed again&s;t phy&s;icians, rather than again&s;t the art it&s;elf. Va|rious mean and unworthy arts have been em|ployed to rai&s;e importance, by per&s;ons impelled
<PB N="9" REF="037264_0010_100CA3245BA44758">
by nece&s;&s;ity, excited by vanity, or anxious to conceal their con&s;cious ignorance. An affectation of profound knowledge, or of my&s;tery in every thing relative to the profe&s;&s;ion; an air of confi|dence in their own &s;kill and abilities; or a &s;olemn and &s;tately demeanour; are &s;ome of the arts, which have been u&s;ed to give celebrity to per|&s;ons, who could not otherwi&s;e have attained it. Such are the arts, which have not e&s;caped the penetration of the more judicious; nor eluded the &s;hafts of ridicule and humour. Hence, in mo&s;t dramatic exhibitions, in which the phy&s;ician is introduced, he is treated as a pedant and a fool. But it is evident, that here, the manners of par|ticular per&s;ons are aimed at; not the profe&s;&s;ion it&s;elf; which, from time immemorial, has been regarded as one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful and beneficial to mankind.</P>
<P>The great Hippocrates has told us, that <Q>The art of Phy&s;ic is the mo&s;t excellent of all arts; and has al&s;o ob&s;erved, that it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of a phy&s;ician to make new di&s;cove|ries in &s;cience, or to perfect &s;uch as are al|ready made; rather than to &s;pend his time in cen&s;uring or depreciating others.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hippocrat. de Arte.</NOTE> This dictate, the re&s;ult of wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, and expe|rience, the mo&s;t illiberal of the profe&s;&s;ion will
<PB N="10" REF="037264_0011_100CA325E53D8608">
not attempt to controvert. The di&s;&s;entions of phy&s;icians are, indeed, the greate&s;t objection which is made to the profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic; and may be regarded as the foundation of every other objection. It is that which the illu&s;trious Bacon advances; and even Hippocrates him&s;elf, who &s;ays, <Q>When phy&s;icians are &s;o much at variance among&s;t them&s;elves, about the method of treat|ing acute di&s;ea&s;es, that the &s;ame method &s;hall be highly extolled by one, and run down by others; phy&s;ic it&s;elf, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity fall into contempt among&s;t the vulgar; who will con|clude from thence, that phy&s;icians them&s;elves have no certain method to pur&s;ue, or that there is no &s;uch art as that of Medicine.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hippocrat. de Ratione Victus in Morb. acutis.</NOTE> This objection has been thus an&s;wered by the &s;ame great man; <Q>That this very di&s;a|greement is a proof of the reality of the art; for if there was no &s;uch thing as an Art of Medicine, no &s;y&s;tem of precepts, or rule of practice for the arti&s;t to be directed by; there would not be good and bad phy&s;icians, as there are now, but all of them would be alike ignorant and un&s;kilful; and the cure of the &s;ick would depend upon chance alone. But as long as phy&s;ic remains an art, &s;o long will one arti&s;t continue to excel another, as well in the goodne&s;s of his hand as head.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hippocrat. de pri&s;ea Medicina.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037264_0012_100CA32904B85BD8">
But, in truth, the utility of Medicine ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> never been &s;eriou&s;ly denied; for every per&s;on who &s;uffers pain or &s;ickne&s;s&punc; will gratefully ac|knowledge, (in words, at lea&s;t, which co&s;t no|thing) the u&s;efulne&s;s of an art from which he obtains relief.</P>
<P>Life, when oppre&s;&s;ed with di&s;ea&s;e, is but a compound of woes. Health adds delight to every enjoyment; and, as the end of medical &s;cience is to re&s;tore and pre&s;erve health, every per&s;on is concerned in its improvement. Me|dicine is as important in its object, as it is diffi|cult in its attainment.&mdash;It is exten&s;ive in its re&s;earches; and pre&s;uppo&s;es an acquaintance with many other &s;ciences: and it demands of tho&s;e who engage in its pur&s;uit, an enlarged and benevolent mind.</P>
<P>A de&s;ire of knowledge, and a &s;pirit of enquiry, are natural to man. The&s;e, therefore, &s;hould be directed to worthy objects. And what can be more &s;o, than the &s;tudy and pre&s;ervation of that mo&s;t &s;imple, yet mo&s;t compound and &s;ur|pri&s;ing work of an Omnipotent Creator! Or, what can tend more effectually to rai&s;e our thoughts, to the Divine Author of its exi&s;tence!</P>
<P>In a &s;ub&s;equent part of this Oration, I &s;hall attempt to demon&s;trate, &s;till further, the utili|ty
<PB N="12" REF="037264_0013_100CA32A8C405270">
of the &s;cience of Medicine, by a &s;hort view of &s;ome of tho&s;e virtues, which the practice of phy&s;ic either does, or ought to in&s;pire, in the brea&s;t of every member of the profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If we take a view of the antiquity of the &s;cience of Medicine, it would nece&s;&s;arily appear, to have been coeval with the origin of man; or at lea&s;t, with the period of his expul&s;ion from that &s;tate of felicity, which he is repre&s;ented to have enjoyed in the garden of Eden. For, as by the cur&s;e, which was inflicted on our fir&s;t parents at the Fall, they were doomed to feel the arrows of af|fliction, and the infirmities of human nature; from that period, attempts mu&s;t have been made for the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, and the relief of acci|dents, which devolved upon them by &s;uch a cur&s;e. The&s;e rude, but well-meant attempts of each per&s;on, to relieve the di&s;tre&s;s of his neighbour, mu&s;t however have cea&s;ed, when &s;ome were &s;uppo&s;ed to have acquired greater &s;kill than others: to the&s;e of cour&s;e, the &s;ick would apply for a&s;&s;i&s;tance;&mdash;and this, in fact, we mu&s;t e&s;teem as the origin of the art: A know|ledge of a few &s;imples, probably formed its ut|mo&s;t extent. I have &s;aid above, that the &s;ci|ence of Medicine mu&s;t have <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> been co|eval with the origin of man:&mdash;I &s;hould rather have &s;aid, that tho&s;e fundamental principles, on
<PB N="13" REF="037264_0014_100CA32C94B75458">
which the &s;cience is founded, exi&s;ted at that early period of the world, in as full force as at pre&s;ent. We only excel our ance&s;tors by the developement of facts; and by a judicious exclu&s;ion of principles, founded in error, and in the belief of preternatural agents and cau&s;es; which exi&s;ted only in the heated imaginations of their authors and their followers. Succeeding generations, it is to be hoped, will improve upon the pre&s;ent; until the highe&s;t degree of know|ledge &s;hall be acquired, which is compatible with the imperfect &s;tate in which we live.</P>
<P>Medicine &s;eems to have attained to greater perfection, among&s;t the Greeks than among&s;t any other nation of antiquity; if we may judge from tho&s;e writings which have come to hand. We are not, however, ab&s;olutely to draw &s;uch a conclu&s;ion; as, from the great difficulty at that period, of tran&s;mitting knowledge to po&s;terity, or even of diffu&s;ing it among&s;t cotemporaries; from the want of &s;ome method of rendering that knowledge permanent; which, fortunately we po&s;&s;e&s;s in the art of printing; when al&s;o we recollect, that a great portion of ancient know|ledge was, by the u&s;e of hieroglyphics, almo&s;t entirely confined in the hands of their prie&s;ts; we may be allowed to &s;uppo&s;e that Greece <HI>alone</HI> did not bear away the palm of &s;cience. This &s;uppo&s;ition is &s;trengthened by the probability
<PB N="14" REF="037264_0015_100CA32E280EE5E8">
that the Greeks derived their literary and &s;cien|tific knowledge from the Egyptians; and that they only extended it by the aid of letters.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Before the invention of letters, mankind may be &s;aid to have been perpetually in their infancy; as the arts of one age or coun|try generally died with their inventors. <HI>Botanic Garden; note on Papyra.</HI></NOTE> Be this however as it may, the Greeks certainly have the merit of having conveyed to the na|tions of Europe, the rudiments of Medicine, and of every other art or &s;cience, at that time known&mdash;<Q>Hippocrates, who has been called the great father of Phy&s;ic, is the fir&s;t, who&s;e writings have been tran&s;mitted to the pre&s;ent day; and we cannot withhold our e&s;teem from him, whether we con&s;ider the morality and liberality of his works, or his numerous and acute ob&s;ervations, together with the great order in which they are conveyed. But</Q> (adds Dr. Denman) <Q>if there be any progre&s;|&s;ive power in the human mind, if there be any advantage obtained in the practice of Me|dicine, by the knowledge of the circulation of the blood; or of a more correct anatomy and phy&s;iology at large; by the application of chemi&s;try; by a more copious Materia Medica; by the records of experience, or by many collateral arts which Medicine calls in to its aid, we may be allowed to &s;ay, that
<PB N="15" REF="037264_0016_100CA330AB07F5F0">
Hippocrates ought not to be con&s;idered as the guide of phy&s;icians at the pre&s;ent time, or as having limited the perfection or extent of the art; but as an illu&s;trious &s;pecimen of an|cient medical knowledge and practice: And if this ob&s;ervation holds good with re&s;pect to Hippocrates, it will have more force when applied to all his tran&s;cribers and commen|tators.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Introduction to Midwifery.</NOTE></P>
<P>Of the dignity of the profe&s;&s;ion of Phy&s;ic, I &s;hall &s;ay but little. It has &s;tood the te&s;t of time; and cannot receive any addition from my prai&s;e. It has always ranked among&s;t the mo&s;t liberal of the profe&s;&s;ions; and on the ju&s;t|e&s;t grounds. To excel in it, requires a larger compa&s;s of knowledge than is nece&s;&s;ary in any other &s;cience. Mathematics, natural hi&s;tory and philo&s;ophy, are nearly allied to it: whil&s;t the exten&s;ive &s;tudies of anatomy, chemi&s;try and botany, are its immediate branches. A knowledge of the dead and living languages, is by many thought indi&s;pen&s;able: and to this we may add, that knowledge of the world, of men and manners, which are highly u&s;eful to the medical character; and which is naturally acquired, from an exten&s;ive intercour&s;e with
<PB N="16" REF="037264_0017_100CA332AEF408E8">
all ranks of people. Medicine, notwith&s;tanding the extent of knowledge which it pre&s;uppo&s;es, is a &s;cience, concerning which every one under|takes to rea&s;on mo&s;t, and yet of which they po&s;|&s;e&s;s the lea&s;t information. Who, that has not made mathematics his &s;tudy, will pre&s;ume to argue on the ab&s;tru&s;e and difficult calculations of algebra? Yet the more difficult and ab&s;tru&s;e &s;cience of Medicine is apparently obtained by intuition; as a previous education &s;eems unne|ce&s;&s;ary to qualify a per&s;on to embrace it at once, in its fulle&s;t extent!</P>
<P>The &s;cience of Medicine is an ample field for the exerci&s;e and di&s;play of genius. No profe&s;&s;ion requires a more comprehen&s;ive mind. In the other learned profe&s;&s;ions, certain laws and &s;ta|tutes exi&s;t, to which every que&s;tion mu&s;t be re|ferred, and by which it mu&s;t be determined;&mdash;a &s;teady application, and a good memory, are here the chief requi&s;ites. Little room is left for the di&s;play of genius, where invention can|not add, nor judgment improve; becau&s;e e&s;|tabli&s;hed laws, whether right or wrong, mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to. In Medicine, where no e&s;|tabli&s;hed laws exi&s;t, the ca&s;e is different&mdash;Eve|ry man mu&s;t re&s;t on his own judgment; and it is his bu&s;ine&s;s to make a &s;election of facts, from tho&s;e theories with which his memory has been loaded in the cour&s;e of a liberal education. To
<PB N="17" REF="037264_0018_100CA334B1C0A9F0">
effect this, the prejudices of youth are to be overcome. This will prove a ta&s;k of the great|e&s;t difficulty; as much candor and patience are e&s;&s;ential, to dive&s;t our minds of what, in general, takes &s;uch forcible po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Were I here to take a view of the many vir|tues, which the profe&s;&s;ion of Phy&s;ic enforces on its adherents, I &s;hould extend this piece far be|yond the u&s;ual limits, and encroach too greatly on that time, upon which, I fear, you already think I have too much tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed. I &s;hall there|fore detain you but a few minutes on this part of my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>An exten&s;ive field is pre&s;ented by Medicine, for the exerci&s;e of HUMANITY. The numerous opportunities of relieving di&s;tre&s;s, which a phy|&s;ician enjoys, mu&s;t, to a benevolent mind, be one of its greate&s;t plea&s;ures. The Faculty have often&punc; been reproached with hardne&s;s of heart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> occa&s;ioned, it is &s;aid, by being &s;o conver&s;ant with human mi&s;ery.

<PB N="18" REF="037264_0019_100CA337001FAD60">
a reproach. Who, after reading the works of Sydenham, a Haller, Boerhaave, and others; will be hardy enough to charge them with &s;uch a failing? A failing, indeed, one of the greate&s;t of which a phy&s;ician can be guilty! Humanity may in fact be regarded, as the greate&s;t moral qualification of a medical man. It is the ori|ginal foundation of the profe&s;&s;ion; acted upon, long before it was regarded as a di&s;tinct &s;ci|ence. Doubtle&s;s, there are many unworthy members of our profe&s;&s;ion, (as is the ca&s;e with every other) to whom &s;uch a charge will ap|ply.&mdash;The lo&s;s, however, of one of the greate&s;t incitements for the relief of the &s;ick, is the proper puni&s;hment it brings with it.&mdash;Habit, it is true, may in&s;ure a command of temper, which may be mi&s;taken for in&s;en&s;ibility; but too great a &s;hare of &s;en&s;ibility, often renders a phy&s;ician incapable of that &s;teadine&s;s and vigor of action, on which perhaps the life of his patient may greatly depend. Men of the mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate tempers, by daily viewing &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s, ac|quire a firmne&s;s of mind, which is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite in the practice of Phy&s;ic. They can feel both pity and compa&s;&s;ion, without allowing them&s;elves to be enervated and unmanned. Tho&s;e who are callous to every &s;entiment of humanity, affect to treat this &s;ympathy with ridicule; by repre&s;enting it, either as hypocri&s;y, or as a proof of a weak mind. There can be no doubt that it
<PB N="19" REF="037264_0020_100CA339863E82C0">
may be, and often is a&s;&s;umed: But it is ea&s;ily &s;een through. Real &s;ympathy, will not permit a phy&s;ician to act differently, to per&s;ons in dif|ferent ranks of life. It is even more careful of &s;hewing it&s;elf towards tho&s;e in better circum|&s;tances; le&s;t an unworthy con&s;truction &s;hould be put upon it. It is equally unfounded, to &s;up|po&s;e a compa&s;&s;ionate and feeling heart, to be the effect of a weak mind. Univer&s;al experience proves the rever&s;e of the propo&s;ition; and that rough and blu&s;tering manners, are more gene|rally concomitants of a weak under&s;tanding; and frequently are a&s;&s;umed to conceal from the world tho&s;e very infirmities which their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors blame in others.</P>
<P>HUMANITY is that &s;en&s;ibility of heart, which makes us feel for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our fellow-creatures; and of con&s;equence, incites us mo&s;t powerfully to their relief. Sympathy produces attention to an hundred circum&s;tances, which may tend to relieve a patient; an attention, be|yond the power of wealth to purcha&s;e. It en|gages the confidence and affection of a patient; which often is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to his recovery. A patient feels the approach of a phy&s;ician who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a compa&s;&s;ionate heart, a &s;oftne&s;s of manners, and, what Shake&s;pear has emphatically called, "the milk of human kind|ne&s;s," like that of an angel mini&s;tring to his re|lief:

Whil&s;t the vi&s;it of a man of har&s;h and brutal manners, makes his heart &s;ink, as at the pre&s;ence of one who is about to pronounce his &s;entence of death.</P>
<P>CHARITY, the offspring of Humanity, is ano|ther important virtue, &s;trongly enforced upon its votaries, by the &s;cience of Medicine. The phy&s;ician, more than any other de&s;cription of men, is mo&s;t conver&s;ant with mi&s;ery and af|fliction. Happy the man who improves from this view of &s;uffering humanity!&mdash;True Charity does not limit her bounty to one cla&s;s or de&s;crip|tion of men; She regards the whole human race as relatives; and the world as her abode. At the bed&s;ide of poverty and &s;ickne&s;s, &s;he is mo&s;t at home; and here, her claims are &s;trong|e&s;t upon the profe&s;&s;ion of Phy&s;ic: From &s;uch a claim, none of its votaries are exempt. They here po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of &s;tripping death of half his terrors; and of &s;moothing the avenues to a|nother world. How high enrolled above the common cla&s;s of men, does the great, the illu&s;|trious HOWARD appear, when vi&s;iting the gloo|my man&s;ions of di&s;ea&s;e and death; and, like a guardian angel, &s;natching from de&s;truction the mi&s;erable wretch, who&s;e feeble lamp of life, &s;carce glimmered in its &s;ocket; or, when re&s;to|ring to the care&s;&s;es of an affectionate family, a haple&s;s parent, who&s;e anxious care and &s;teady

Let us view this extraordinary man, (who lived not for him&s;elf, but for man|kind) with active benevolence, expo&s;ing him|&s;elf to the mo&s;t contagious di&s;ea&s;es; unappalled by the rapid &s;trides of death; cheering, by his affability and mildne&s;s, the bed of &s;ickne&s;s or di&s;tre&s;s; and, like a good Samaritan, admini&s;|tring the balm which &s;hould ameliorate the &s;uf|ferings of the afflicted!

The plea&s;ing retro&s;pect of a well-&s;pent life, upheld him in the conflict, and enabled him to

<P>PATIENCE next to the above mentioned vir|tues, is of the greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity to the medical man. It might, indeed, in &s;ome points of view, be regarded as a branch of humanity. The ne|ce&s;&s;ity for the exerci&s;e of this virtue, ari&s;es from many and various &s;ources. I have already noticed a very con&s;iderable one, in the di&s;&s;en|tions of the Faculty, and the illiberality, which &s;ometimes prevails among&s;t them. I &s;hall there|fore here, only mention that, ari&s;ing from the conduct of patients them&s;elves; together, with the contradictions and di&s;appointments, to which, in the cour&s;e of his practice, the phy&s;i|cian is &s;ubjected. The la&s;t, more frequently a|ri&s;es, from too great &s;trictne&s;s in his directions; which, if not ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to the wel|fare
<PB N="24" REF="037264_0025_100CA34386F54FA0">
of the patient, had better be avoided; as the almo&s;t invariable non-compliance with them, nece&s;&s;arily leads to a concealment of &s;uch a de|viation. Hence, he is ignorant of the true &s;tate of the &s;ick; and a&s;cribes to the di&s;ea&s;e, what is probably owing to irregularity in diet; or at|tributes effects to medicines, which were daily thrown into the fire, or out of a window. A phy&s;ician &s;hould certainly be ab&s;olute in his go|vernment over his patients: To this, however, few will &s;ubmit; and indeed, a phy&s;ician has no ju&s;t title of complaint, if his advice is not fol|lowed; as he has no right to prevent any one from going out of the world in his own way.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e afflicted with nervous di&s;ea&s;es, contri|bute not a little, to call forth the patience of a phy&s;ician. Though their fears are groundle&s;s, for the mo&s;t part; yet their &s;ufferings are real; and hence, to treat them with neglect, or indif|ference, is equally cruel and ab&s;urd. The di&s;|orders of the mind demand the tendere&s;t &s;ym|pathy; and the greate&s;t &s;kill is required to avoid neglect and ridicule on the one hand; and too anxious a &s;olicitude on the other.</P>
<P>As you mu&s;t all be &s;en&s;ible how much the characters of individuals, as well as the peace and happine&s;s of families; may &s;ometimes de|pend upon the exerci&s;e of the virtues of di&s;cre|tion,
<PB N="25" REF="037264_0026_100CA3458C168B20">
honor and &s;ecrecy; I &s;hall not enlarge up|on their nece&s;&s;ity to a phy&s;ician. From his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, many opportunities mu&s;t occur, of knowing the private tran&s;actions, and characters of families&mdash;He views mankind under the mo&s;t di&s;advantageous circum&s;tances: Oppre&s;&s;ed by pain and &s;ickne&s;s; leading to peevi&s;hne&s;s, and impatience; in place of their u&s;ual cheerfulne&s;s and vigor of mind.</P>
<P>Temperance and &s;obriety, are e&s;&s;ential to the character of the medical man. You will at once accede to the propo&s;ition, on my merely &s;tat|ing it. Judgment, di&s;cernment, and every re|qui&s;ite qualification to the phy&s;ician; are totally incompatible with a want of the&s;e virtues.</P>
<P>The high importance of medical &s;cience is obvious, not merely from what has been &s;aid; but al&s;o, from con&s;idering its improvement as in &s;ome degree dependant, on the progre&s;s of all the other numerous arts and &s;ciences.

The ample volume of the works of nature is open to our view, and each votary to &s;cience, is loudly invited, to a participation of the luxu|riant banquet, which its pages afford. Your indu&s;try, and per&s;everance, Gentlemen, will go far to rai&s;e our country, to an equal eminence with the mo&s;t favoured parts of the globe. New and certain avenues to the temples of honor and of fame, will here be lighted up, by the radiant torch of truth: Let me hope, that many whom I now addre&s;s; are de&s;tined to attain an eminence, as great as Newton, Bacon, Boyle, and all tho&s;e other illu&s;trious cha|racters, who rank &s;o high in the annals of &s;ci|ence.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ubject of regret, that the knowledge of medical &s;cience, is &s;o diffu&s;ed, through va&s;t numbers of volumes, and in different languages,

Such works are peculiarly acceptable to per&s;ons en|gaged in exten&s;ive practice; or who are remote from the centre of publication.

<P>Permit me, Gentlemen, to extend for a few minutes, this view of a &s;ubject &s;o highly inter|e&s;ting to us, as fellow-members of the &s;ame in|&s;titution. How grateful mu&s;t be the recollec|tion of its rapid increa&s;e! Scarcely have ten years elap&s;ed, &s;ince it fir&s;t &s;prung into exi&s;tence, by the active and well-directed endeavours of a few individuals; and already do we reckon a|mong&s;t its members, mo&s;t of the re&s;pectable and eminent of the profe&s;&s;ion, throughout the United

<P>I confidently tru&s;t, that the zeal which has heretofore been evinced in the advancement of its reputation; will &s;till exi&s;t, to carry it yet further on the road to perfection; when you are &s;ettled in your profe&s;&s;ional pur&s;uits at a di&s;|tance from us.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t remind you, Gentlemen, that the ob|jects of this &s;ociety, are more exten&s;ive, than I believe is generally imagined. We are not to be limited to the reception, or di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, of medical facts or papers. We mu&s;t con&s;ider, that the republic of Medicine, which extends its influence throughout the univer&s;e; and of which, we are fellow-members; has a ju&s;t claim upon our ex|ertions. The publication of Tran&s;actions and Memoirs, is, if I mi&s;take not, an important part of the intentions of this in&s;titution. The carrying into execution this important mea&s;ure, (in which unfortunately, we have been too neglectful) will evince to the world that &s;cience is not confined to the &s;hores of Europe. Hitherto, our exer|tions have been very limited. Let us now endea|vour to render our&s;elves con&s;picuous, as a lite|rary and &s;cientific Body. Let each member think
<PB N="29" REF="037264_0030_100CA34DF2A59B50">
that on his individual exertions, depends the honour of the whole; and we &s;oon &s;hall &s;ee it ri&s;e to an unexampled pitch of celebrity and reputation. Each member has it in his power to enrich the &s;ociety, by favouring it with ac|curate details, of facts and ob&s;ervations; toge|ther with the hi&s;tories of di&s;ea&s;es, remarkable either in them&s;elves or treatment; with di&s;&s;ec|tions of &s;uch morbid bodies as may come under their notice; and the remarks and inferences, occa&s;ioned thereby. A judicious &s;election from the&s;e, for publication, could not fail of &s;oon ren|dering us known, abroad and at home. Such a work would doubtle&s;s meet with a ready recep|tion; e&s;pecially, as each member would wi&s;h to po&s;&s;e&s;s a publication, in the honor of which he found him&s;elf &s;o clo&s;ely intere&s;ted.</P>

If they have failed in affording you either in&s;truction or amu&s;ement; I tru&s;t you will neverthele&s;s re|ceive them with indulgence, in con&s;ideration of your having made &s;o bad an election.&mdash;With every wi&s;h for your uninterrupted health and pro&s;perity; I now bid you an affectionate adieu.</P>
