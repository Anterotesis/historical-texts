<Q><HI>"THE LORD RAISED UP A DELIVERER TO THE CHIL|DREN OF ISRAEL."</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS day, a very large and exten&s;ive Na|tion exhibit every token of funeral &s;orrow.&mdash;Wherever we turn our eyes, we behold the &s;ignals of mourning di&s;played.&mdash;The countenance of ev|ery American citizen proclaims, in &s;ilent accents, that man is mortal; that no character, or &s;tation in life, exempts from the irrevocable &s;entence, <HI>"Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."</HI></P>
<P>OUR <HI>WASHINGTON</HI> IS NO MORE!&mdash;Had he continued to this day, he would have com|pleted &s;ixty eight years; but the LORD of all worlds, who gave him as our deliverer, has &s;een fit to call him hence; he departed this life the 14th of December la&s;t.&mdash;And, under the pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances, reflecting on pa&s;t events, may we not experimentally comment upon the words of the text, and apply them to our&s;elves, as they were applied to I&s;rael, re&s;pecting the Divine conduct towards them;&mdash;"the LORD rai&s;ed up a deliverer to the children of I&s;rael."</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="039133_0004_1013E8F596DD9B70">
In the time of our di&s;tre&s;s, the LORD, in like manner, rai&s;ed up a deliverer to his American I&s;|rael. That we may rightly under&s;tand the bu&s;ine&s;s, for which we are convened, it may be inquired, to whom are we to offer the&s;e honours? To of|fer them to the dead, would be very un&s;uitable. To GOD only, in memory of the dead, may &s;uch offerings be paid.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, that we may properly re|alize our lo&s;s, and &s;en&s;ibly feel our obligations of gratitude to the Mo&s;t High GOD, for pa&s;t favours; &s;ome general ob&s;ervations upon this pa&s;&s;age of Scripture, by way of analogy, will now be made; which may lead to a more particular improvement.</P>
<P>As from a &s;tate of Egyptian bondage, the LORD brought I&s;rael to po&s;&s;e&s;s the land of Canaan; &s;o from a &s;tate of oppre&s;&s;ion, the LORD conducted our Fore-Fathers to inherit this land, that here they might peaceably enjoy that religion which they could not in their native country.</P>
<P>The ob&s;tacles which ob&s;tructed I&s;rael when entering upon their inheritance, were many and great; and the interpo&s;itions of Providence were wonderful in fulfilling the promi&s;e of this event, which was made to Abraham, that his &s;eed &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s that land. Great al&s;o were the dangers which our Progenitors encountered, and &s;ignal were the di&s;plays of Divine goodne&s;s, in their &s;et|tling in this then uncultivated wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="039133_0005_1013E8F71FEB18C8">
I&s;rael, for a long time, flouri&s;hed in their new &s;ettlements; even &s;o long as they &s;erved the LORD, they &s;at down quietly, having none to make them afraid; for the LORD was their defence. No le&s;s did the LORD give re&s;t to his people, in this Co|lumbian land; and defended the vine, which his own right hand had planted, from the violence of all tho&s;e who ro&s;e up again&s;t them.</P>
<P>At this period, referred to by the Divine hi&s;|torian, I&s;rael, becau&s;e they had &s;inned, were great|ly oppre&s;&s;ed by a foreign nation, into who&s;e hand the LORD had &s;old them for their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion again&s;t him: Thus they were greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed be|cau&s;e the Me&s;opotamians reigned over them. In their trouble, they cried unto the LORD, and the LORD heard them, and rai&s;ed up for them a deliv|erer&mdash;even Othniel, the &s;on of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother: And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him; and the LORD delivered I&s;rael by his hand. Not un&s;imilar was the &s;tate of our nation, when our liberties were attacked by the power of Britain.</P>
<P>We may learn &s;omething of our critical &s;itua|tion at that time, if we revert back to the memora|ble period of the ma&s;&s;acre at Bo&s;ton, which took place in the year of our LORD 1770. After that, the circum&s;tances grew more threatening, and the dangers were greatly increa&s;ed, by the enforcing of the <HI>Stamp-Act,</HI> and other unrea&s;onable <HI>duties,</HI> which
<PB N="6" REF="039133_0006_1013E8F90A32C760">
occa&s;ioned the de&s;truction of <HI>tea</HI> in the year 1773. The con&s;ternation from that time &s;pread far and wide, &s;o that the &s;everal States, each one con&s;ult|ing for their own &s;afety, &s;ent Delegates, who met at Philadelphia, September 5th, 1774, to form a <HI>Union,</HI> and to adopt mea&s;ures to defend the com|mon <HI>Intere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But, humanly &s;peaking, how <HI>weak,</HI> if compar|ed with tho&s;e by whom they were oppo&s;ed! How unprepared for <HI>War,</HI> as to military &s;kill, and war-like equipments! Without any e&s;tabli&s;hed form of Government, or public re&s;ources!</P>
<P>Under the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances, what could Congre&s;s do? Having organized them|&s;elves, they endeavoured to a&s;&s;ert the rights to which the Colonies were entitled by the laws of nature, the principles of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, and their &s;everal Charters. Among tho&s;e rights, were con&s;idered Life, Liberty, and Property; a right to di&s;po&s;e of which, without their con&s;ent, they had given to no &s;overeign power whatever. Yet, rather than ra&s;hly to &s;et up for Independence, they &s;ue for peace, by way of entreaty.</P>
<P>Now, leaving the infant Republic, trembling through fear, yet firmly a&s;&s;erting her native right, while &s;he &s;tretches out the &s;uppliant hand, &s;eeking a ju&s;t redre&s;s of her wrongs; we may, for a mo|ment, turn our eyes on the &s;ide of our unnatural enemy: And we behold them, a great and mighty

nation, renowned in all the arts of war, furni&s;hed with every needed &s;upply, ma&s;ters of the &s;ea, and deaf to all propo&s;als of accommodation &s;hort of un|conditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Vain, O America! was the help of man! This, our political Fathers &s;aw, in the day of our calamity. Therefore the Congre&s;s, June 7th, 1775, re&s;olved, that Thur&s;day, July 20th, be ob&s;erved, throughout the Twelve United Colo|nies, as a day of humiliation, fa&s;ting, and prayer. Thus in the day of their affliction, they cried unto the LORD.</P>
<P>It was now needful, that &s;ome one &s;hould be appointed Commander in Chief, on whom it &s;hould devolve to manage the whole war. June 15th, the Congre&s;s, by ballot, unanimou&s;ly cho&s;e <HI>GEORGE WASHINGTON,</HI> E&s;q. to this office. He was then in the 43d year of his age.&mdash;From early life he had been trained up for &s;uch a day as <HI>this:</HI> amply furni&s;hed with military &s;kill and political knowledge&mdash;and had now arrived to mature age for renown|ed exploits. A &s;pecimen of <HI>his</HI> character, whom GOD rai&s;ed up as our deliverer, and to whom our country entru&s;ted all which they held dear, we may &s;ee in his an&s;wer when invited to accept his ap|pointment. The Pre&s;ident of the Hou&s;e reque&s;t|ed his acceptance. He, <HI>(Washington)</HI> &s;tanding in his place, &s;aid:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. PRESIDENT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I am truly &s;en&s;ible of the high honour done me, in this appointment, yet I feel great di&s;tre&s;s, from a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="8" REF="039133_0008_1013E9004D20AFF0">
that my abilities and military experience may not be equal to the exten&s;ive and important tru&s;t. However, as the Congre&s;s de&s;ire it, I will enter upon the momentous duty, and exert every power I po&s;&s;e&s;s, in their &s;ervice, and for the &s;up|port of the glorious cau&s;e. I beg they will accept my mo&s;t cordial thanks, for this di&s;tingui&s;hed te&s;timony of their appro|bation.</P>
<P>But, le&s;t &s;ome unlucky event &s;hould happen, unfavour|able to my reputation, I beg it may be remembered, by every gentleman in the room, that I this day declare, with the ut|mo&s;t &s;incerity, I do not think my&s;elf equal to the command I am honoured with.</P>
<P>"As to pay, Sir, I beg leave to a&s;&s;ure the Congre&s;s, that, as no pecuniary con&s;ideration could have tempted me to accept this arduous employment, at the expen&s;e of my dome&s;tic ea&s;e and happine&s;s, I do not wi&s;h to make any profit from it. I will keep an exact account of my expen&s;es: Tho&s;e, I doubt not, they will di&s;charge&mdash;and that is all I de&s;ire.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>From that day, the eyes of all were turned up|on him as the Commander in Chief of the Ameri|can forces. This office he filled, to the great &s;atis|faction of his fellow citizens, to the terror of his enemies, and to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the world;&mdash;manife&s;ting, on all occa&s;ions, fidelity, &s;kill, firm|ne&s;s, and re&s;olution; till at length he obtained for the United Independent States. an honourable peace, which was ratified by Great Britain in the year 1784.</P>
<P>How HE, who ruleth among the nations, has improved him as an in&s;trument of &s;aving his peo-people, from the time of his leaving the army, till he departed this life, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to relate. The
<PB N="9" REF="039133_0009_1013E901D51F9F90">
hi&s;tory is &s;o recent, and his public virtues have &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed the mind of every American citi|zen, that we may clearly &s;ee, that as "the LORD rai&s;ed up a deliverer to the children of I&s;rael." when in their trouble they cried unto him&mdash;&s;o GOD hath done for us.</P>
<P>Thus our &s;ubject opens into a very exten&s;ive field for contemplation and practical improvement.&mdash;Whenever we look back upon the complex &s;cene of the American revolution, and duly con|&s;ider, from a &s;tatement of facts, how it was brought about&mdash;what difficulties have been overcome&mdash;what ob&s;tacles have been &s;urmounted&mdash;till, from &s;mall beginnings, the Republic is become great, even the mo&s;t permanent and flouri&s;hing kingdom in the world&mdash;an a&s;ylum of <HI>Liberty,</HI> both civil and religious&mdash;and all this &s;o much owing, as a mean, to the &s;kill, wi&s;dom, and political virtue of one man&mdash;we are filled with reverential wonder at the coun|&s;els of Heaven. And we may hence nationally in|fer, that this great event, in all its connections, was fixed in the divine mind <HI>long before</HI> it took place: "For known unto GOD are all his works, from the beginning of the world; even to him who worketh all things after the coun&s;el of his own will."</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o it appears evident, that our deliver|ance, from time to time, <HI>was, has been,</HI> and <HI>still is,</HI> of the LORD. He is the LORD of Ho&s;ts: he doth his plea&s;ure among the children of men: he hath
<PB N="10" REF="039133_0010_1013E9046518DF38">
made u&s;e of in&s;truments, &s;uch as he cho&s;e; but has ever manife&s;ted him&s;elf wonderful in coun&s;el. Ev|ery in&s;tance of our &s;alvation, he hath wrought in &s;uch a way and in &s;uch a manner as might lead us <HI>to feel</HI> our entire dependance: for he hath rai&s;ed up, and hath put down; &s;howing, that the race is not to the &s;wi&s;t, nor the battle to the &s;trong&mdash;As he &s;aved I&s;rael of old, &s;o hath he &s;aved us. We may therefore adopt their &s;ong, and &s;ay, "If it had not been the Lord who was on our &s;ide; now may I&s;rael &s;ay, if it had not been the Lord who was on our &s;ide, when men ro&s;e up again&s;t us, then they had &s;wallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled again&s;t us: then the waters had overwhelm|ed us, the &s;tream had gone over our &s;oul: then the proud waters had gone over our &s;oul. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth."</P>
<P>We further learn, that to attribute any thing more of our &s;afety to any man, than as being one whom the Lord rai&s;ed up, qualified and improved, as an in&s;trument, would be to rob God of that glo|ry which is due to his name from us whom he hath delivered. There is a propriety in rendering to all their dues; "tribute, to whom tribute is due; cu&s;|tom, to whom cu&s;tom; fear, to whom fear; honor&punc; to whom honor." God is the rightful Proprietor and the Supreme Governor of all things. Every good, of which any are the recepients, is from him,
<PB N="11" REF="039133_0011_1013E90623C7F150">
and thank&s;giving therefor is due to his name.&mdash;Creatures&punc; by whom, as in&s;truments, God at any time communicates his favours, are, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, to be con&s;idered as the mini&s;ters of God; and as &s;uch they are to be regarded and treated; and, even for their works &s;ake, to be re&s;pected.&mdash;But, we may not give that honour to the &s;ervant, which is due to his ma&s;ter; we may not a&s;cribe that to the creature, which is due to the great Creator, who is Lord of all&mdash;without being guilty of &s;acri|lege more criminal than can ju&s;tly be charged up|on the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hen world. Let us take heed, therefore, while we render to man his due, that we al&s;o ren|der to God the things which are God's: For we may with propriety apply to our&s;elves, what God &s;aid upon this &s;ubject to his ancient I&s;rael: "I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the hou&s;e of bondage. Thou &s;halt have no other gods before Me. Thou &s;halt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likene&s;s of any thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. Thou &s;halt not bow down thy&s;elf to them, nor &s;erve them: For I the LORD thy God <HI>am a jealous God</HI> vi&s;iting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth gene|ration of them that hat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> me; and &s;hewing mercy unto thou&s;ands of them that love me and keep my commandments." And we may add the words of
<PB N="12" REF="039133_0012_101466CBF4C9CB40">
the prophet, "I am the LORD, that is my name, and my glory will I not give to another; neither my prai&s;e to graven images."</P>
<P>In reference to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, our &s;ubject may well penetrate every heart with a feeling &s;en&s;e of this important truth, that as we have rea&s;on to mourn the lo&s;s of a much beloved Citizen, who has been, in his day, u&s;eful beyond what we can fully de&s;cribe; &s;o, in the &s;ame proportion, we are un|der obligation of gratitude to the Great Giver of every good, for the be&s;towment of &s;uch an one. In him centred all the rare endowments needful for the important &s;tation to which he was a&s;&s;igned. Through the different &s;tages of his public life, he has pa&s;&s;ed with a character un&s;ullied&punc; His virtues are known&mdash;His examples &s;hine&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> coun&s;els (as a parent's to his children) being regarded, will re|dound to our future peace:&mdash;So that he, being dead, yet &s;peaketh. When &s;uch a friend, &s;o beloved&mdash;when &s;uch a citizen, &s;o re&s;pected&mdash;when &s;uch a pa|tron, &s;o univer&s;ally con&s;idered as the deliverer of his country, is removed, who can refrain from tears! When the beauty of America is fallen, &s;hall not her daughters weep! What heart &s;o in&s;en&s;ible as not to &s;hare in the general grief!&mdash;His name will live in the memory of every American, &s;o long as they &s;hall reli&s;h the &s;weets of Liberty&mdash;or rather than &s;ubmit to &s;ervitude, they &s;hall chu&s;e to be free.&mdash;To what other man were we ever &s;o much indebted
<PB N="13" REF="039133_0013_1013E90E3AB59A20">
for our independent e&s;tabli&s;hment, political peace, and civil privileges, as we are to him? Yet while, as worthy of our attention and imitation, we call to mind the virtues, the public &s;ervices, and the un&s;haken patrioti&s;m, of the decea&s;ed, and pay the&s;e grateful re&s;pects to his memory, we ought carefully to bear this in mind, that to us he was one of the gifts of Heaven, rai&s;ed up for tho&s;e important pur|po&s;es which were effected by him. Let us never forget the goodne&s;s of God, in his benefits be&s;tow|ed upon our land. And to expre&s;s &s;uitable feelings of heart under this bereaving providence, we may adopt the words of Job in his affliction, "the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord."</P>
<P>Moreover, our political parent, decea&s;ed, has left us in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t valuable Legacy, which the great Parent of all ble&s;&s;ings did, by him, as an in&s;trument, bequeath to us&mdash;even an e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>Independence</HI> among the nations, and a permanent and well organized <HI>Government,</HI> un|der which we enjoy all the natural immunities ap|pertaining to a free people. In conformity to mo+ral obligation&mdash;in imitation of tho&s;e virtues, by the medium of which the&s;e public rights were procured&mdash;and influenced by the animating pro&s;pect of fu|ture political happine&s;s&mdash;let us exert our&s;elves, in our &s;everal characters, to maintain our rank in the &s;cale of nations, to &s;upport our con&s;titutional Gov|ernment,
<PB N="14" REF="039133_0014_1013E90FCD890EB0">
and thereby pre&s;erve our privileges in|violate, that we may leave them a rich inheritance for our po&s;terity.</P>
<P>And now, while we thus decorate the tomb of our much re&s;pected friend, with laurels of re&s;pect, wet with tears, and rai&s;e monuments to his memory as our deliverer, we &s;hould take heed le&s;t we for|get the divine favours received by the hand of oth|ers, and overlook that tribute of re&s;pect due to them as having de&s;erved well of their country, ma|ny of whom, while contending in the field of battle for the cau&s;e of Liberty and Religion, met an ear|ly death. Many, in every rank of citizens, have done worthily; and even the private &s;oldier, who is virtuous and valiant, is entitled to honour. In our &s;truggle to defend our privileges, the Lord in|&s;pired our <HI>Senators</HI> with wi&s;dom, our <HI>Officers</HI> with &s;kill, and our <HI>Armies</HI> with courage; but &s;ent &s;aint|ne&s;s into the hearts of our enemies. Therefore our &s;alvation was of the Lord, in ways my&s;terious and unexpected&mdash;and to his name be the glory.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now only ob&s;erve further, that as the Lord has been our refuge, our &s;trength, and our glory, &s;o there is every encouragement, in a hum|ble, penitent manner, &s;till to make him our confi|dence. To whom &s;hall we go, but unto the Lord? With him is coun&s;el and &s;trength. Prai&s;e is due to his name, that we have &s;o many worthy charac|ters now active on the &s;tage of life; and in partic|ular,
<PB N="15" REF="039133_0015_1013E911AD01AEC8">
that our Confederate Chair of State is filled with one on whom re&s;ts the &s;pirit of Elijah&mdash;and that our Government is &s;o wi&s;ely admini&s;tered by men of our own chu&s;ing, but of God's providing.</P>
<P>We ought, therefore, ever to implore the Mo&s;t High, who is the Father of lights, that he would graciou&s;ly give us <HI>men of integrity,</HI> to fill every pub|lic &s;tation, and endow them with wi&s;dom to di&s;cern both time and judgment: &s;o &s;hall we be that hap|py people, who&s;e God is the LORD.</P>
