<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">T was foretold &amp; Prophe&s;ied of, in <HI>Joel</HI> 2 28, 29 How that <HI>the Lord would pour out His Spirit upon all Fle&s;h, and that the Sons and Daughters of His People &s;hould Prophe&s;ie and their Old Men &s;hould dream Dreams, and their Young Men &s;hould &s;ee Vi&s;ions. and al&s;o that upon the Servants and Hand|maids He would pour out His Spirit.</HI> If it be now in &s;undry Places of this Land &s;o, that they behold in any Remarkable manner and mea&s;ure the Accom|pli&s;hment of that Prophecy and Promi&s;e, as it is in|deed very credibly Reported to be &s;o with &s;undry Places, I can the more ea&s;ily Credit &s;uch a matter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">m <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tance of Mrs. <HI>Eli&s;abeth</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th Relate and &s;et forth.</P>
<P>The&s;e mentioned Per&s;ons were formerly of the Church of CHRIST here in <HI>A&s;hford</HI>; and the mentio|ned Mr <HI>John Mixer</HI> was the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acon with us.

<P>As I was very much knowing, in the time of it, to the things &s;et forth in this Account of Mrs <HI>E|li&s;abeth Mixer,</HI> and that either by being Pre&s;ent with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aring &amp; believing what others, who were Ear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itne&s;&s;es did &s;ay concerning her: So I have been (as I was de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir'd) gathering together <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> now Related of her, from the &s;everal Pa|pers written by diver&s;e Hands that contained them,

And if they &s;hould be|come (by my pains in the matter) more communi|cated to the Knowlege of others than they have ever as yet been. I hope the knowlege of &s;uch things will be of great U&s;e and Service to Excite and &s;tir up People to &s;eek the LORD and the Manife&s;tations of His &s;pecial Love and Favour, to make &s;ure of a Saving Intere&s;t in CHRIST, to prepare for Death and Judgment and Eternity, to E&s;cape the Mi&s;eries the Wicked &s;hall for ever Ensure in Hell, and to Obtain the Everla&s;ting Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and Joys of the Triumphant Saints in Heaven: To make &s;ure of Saving Grace here, and &s;o of Glory hereafter&punc; And to a care to live above the World, avoiding the Pride and Sinful Vanities &s;o much practi&s;ed and followed in the World&punc; And particularly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> than their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Lu&s;ts and Vanities.</P>

<P>It is well to be Remark'd that the holy and pious Conver&s;ation of the Per&s;on here &s;poken of, as Ex|periencing her &s;elf and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, has been an&s;werable to their thing and &s;o long maintained, and that &s;he has Engage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o much the Comforts and Peace of GOD's cho&s;en People &s;ince tho&s;e her Remarkable Experiences.</P>

<P>And now, as it may be of &s;ome particular Service to give a more full and clear Account about her Re|lation, afore&s;aid; I would mention, That accord|ing to the Church Record I have, &s;he was Received into full Communion <HI>November</HI> the 6<HI>th,</HI> 1720, And it &s;eems then it was Publickly Read, accord|ing to our Cu&s;tom, <HI>viz.</HI> her Relation of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.

<P>But what an Amazing Day will it be to the Wicked, when they &s;hall Crawl out of their Graves like Toads? (as I read in a Book) and will then call to the Saints and &s;ay, Take us along with you! But the Devils will catch them away to Hell and

<P>At another time, as declaring her own Spiritual di&s;cerning, &s;o giving good Coun&s;el to People, which &s;he was Enabled wonderfully to do. E&s;pecially to give good Coun&s;el to Young People.</P>
<P><HI>She &s;aid to this purpo&s;e,</HI> I &s;ee that Eternity is Boundle&s;s and Endle&s;s, &s;o as I never did &s;ee it before. Were it not for Eternity, the Saints in Heaven could not be happy.</P>
<P>And &s;peaking with re&s;pect to the never|Ending Joys the Saints have in Heaven, &s;he al&s;o &s;aid, <HI>Oh! That I were with them Prai&s;ing of GOD. When millions of millions of Years are at an End, their Joys are as fre&s;h as at their fir&s;t Entring.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;peaking to them that were round about her, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>Look into Eternity; his E|ternity that makes Hell mi&s;erable. How dread|ful is it for any Soul to go to Hell, to Peri&s;h for Ever?</HI></P>
<P><HI>And &s;he &s;aid to them that were Pre&s;ent with her, to this purpo&s;e;</HI> If you did but &s;ee what Amiablene&s;s there is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t! Sweet Je&s;us Christ! He is altogether Lovely. His Grace is much better than Gold. Gold is not to be mentioned with it. It is Chri&s;t that Beautifies and Adorns the Soul by His Grace and makes it
<PB N="6" REF="040101_0010_10162B9921240DF8">to &s;hine. If you did but &s;ee how Heaven &s;hines, the Angels &s;hining, and the Saints with their white Robes and white Garments! Oh! That per&s;ons would mind their precious Souls. Oh! what a precious thing is the Soul? Oh! The never Ending Eternity. Oh! That God would help me this once more to Prai&s;e Him, that I might warn Per|&s;ons of their danger of Peri&s;hing. O that any Soul &s;hould Peri&s;h! That any of the <HI>Indians</HI> Souls &s;hould go to Hell! That there ever &s;hould be a &s;in|ful Thought, or a wicked Word &s;poken! Al|though there is none Perfect, that can live without Sin. Sin dwells in per&s;ons and will be always warring and fighting: but by the &s;trength of Chri&s;t per&s;ons can overcome. Per&s;ons mind the World; but Heaven &s;hould be in their thoughts and mind, and in their &s;peech and di&s;cour&s;e. They &s;hould talk of nothing of the World but what is nece&s;&s;ary. They &s;hould keep Chri&s;t neare&s;t their hearts, the World under their feet, and Eternity in their eye.</P>
<P>The &s;in of Pride is an heinous Sin in the &s;ight of God, and reigns among People. Young People take care to prink and fine up their Bodies, but they have more need to take care of their Souls, to get Chri&s;t to &s;tand their Friend. O that any &s;hould put a du&s;t of Powder upon their Hair, or a Ribbon on their Caps, that have more need to put on Sack|cloth. God abhors the Proud, but it is an humble contrite Spirit that God accepts.</P>

<P>She &s;aid to them that were pre&s;ent with her, <HI>O Friends, I intreat you not to forget ETER|NITY.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;he de&s;ired that their Souls might have on them the white Robes of Chri&s;t's Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and that every Soul of them pre&s;ent with her, might be wa&s;hed clean in the Blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>She &s;pake to them that were pre&s;ent, con|cerning the Judgment to come, and how that they mu&s;t appear before the Judgment Seat of Chri&s;t to give an account of every Thing; and how Joyful it would be and Ble&s;&s;ed for the Righteous then, that their Sins &s;hould be blotted out. But &s;he &s;pake as to the Wicked, that their Sins &s;hould Condemn them, and that the Devils would drag them into Hell|fire, where he would tare and torture them; and that they &s;hould &s;hriek throughout the never-ending Ages of Eternity.</P>
<P>She called to the <HI>Young People</HI> that were pre&s;ent, Warning them not to go to Frolicks, nor to &s;pend their Time Idly nor Vainly, but to mind their precious Souls She told them that they &s;hould improve heir precious Time and Opportunities, Sermons and Sabbaths.
<PB N="8" REF="040101_0012_10162B9AB9C72728">She &s;pake unto all in general, that were then pre&s;ent with her, Telling them that they could not Love God Enough, that they could not Serve Chri&s;t Enough.

And &s;he &s;pake to them, mentioning that Chri&s;t &s;pilt his Precious Blood on the Cro&s;s, to Redeem Souls from Sin. And &s;aying, <HI>GOD is Spotle&s;s and Holy and cannot look upon Sin with any Allowance. O Sin, Sin! That ever any &s;hould &s;in and grieve &s;o good a GOD! The Holine&s;s, Holine&s;s there is in Heaven! No man without Holine&s;s &s;hall &s;ee God.</HI></P>
<P>Further, At another time (it being Lord's-day-Evening, <HI>July</HI> 3<HI>d,</HI> 1720,) &s;he &s;pake to this purpo&s;e; <HI>Oh!

<P>I Have cau&s;e to ble&s;s GOD, that I was Born and brought up in a Land of Light, under the joyful Sound of the Go&s;pel; That I was Baptized in my Infancy, being a Child of the Covenant.

<P>Betwixt Seven &amp; Eight Years I was awake|ned &amp; &s;tirred up to the duty of Secret Prayer, from the thoughts of another World.</P>
<P>When I was about Thirteen Years of Age, God wrought in me, by His Holy Spirit, longing De&s;ires to come to the Holy Ordi|nance of the Lord's Supper. Hearing the Reverend Mr. <HI>Hale</HI> Preach from, I&s;a. 1 18. <HI>Come now, let us rea&s;on together, &s;aith the Lord: though your &s;ins be as &s;carlet, they &s;hall be as white as &s;now; though they be red like crim&s;on, they &s;hall be as wool</HI> I was thereby Encouraged to come to God.</P>

<P>But it being &s;uch an high and holy Ordi|nance; and I having a &s;en&s;e of my own Unworthine&s;s, it made me to delay coming, le&s;t <HI>coming Unworthily, I &s;hould eat and drink Judgment to my &s;elf.</HI> I was then de&s;iring Grace of God, that I might be fitted for it: The Preparations of the heart in man <HI>being from the LORD.</HI></P>

<P>But I yet remain'd in Darkne&s;s; and here were many Prayers put up for me, by the Re|verend Mr <HI>Hale,</HI> and by my Chri&s;tian Friends and Neighbours And in an&s;wer to their Prayers, God appeared very wonderfully for me.

<P>I &s;aw what an amazing day that Day will be to the Wicked, when they &s;hall &s;ee &s;uch Lightnings, &amp; hear &s;uch Thundrings, as will pierce into the very bowels of the Earth.</P>

<P>I &s;aw that Chri&s;t was able and willing to Save unto the uttermo&s;t, all that come unto Him, even the chiefe&s;t of Sinners. Although their Souls were &s;tained with Sin, yet that there was Virtue enough in the &s;weet Blood of Chri&s;t, to wa&s;h out the &s;tains of Sin, and make them clean in the &s;ight of God.
