<HEAD>AN EULOGY.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the &s;olemnity of the hour, you, my FELLOW TOWNS|MEN, call upon me to paint the character and to portray the virtues of the favorite SON OF COLUMBIA. Una|ble to ri&s;e to the height of his excellence, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit his merits to your knowledge of his actions; and lodge his worth in the grate|ful affections of your hearts.</P>
<P>ON this day, &s;ixtyeight years complete their revolutions, &s;ince our WASHINGTON was given to his country. The Parent of Being endowed him with &s;uperior powers of mind and body. The&s;e by the progre&s;s of time were expanded to the mo&s;t commanding features of
<PB N="6" REF="036888_0004_100B2A0FC8E61380">
man. His clear and comprehen&s;ive under|&s;tanding was improved by a general acquaint|ance with &s;cience, an exten&s;ive knowledge of hi&s;tory, and an intimate view of human na|ture. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the&s;e grand principles of knowledge, he early di&s;covered a happy genius to apply them to practice. His opinions were always formed upon an high &s;cene of ob&s;erva|tion. His capacity can be mea&s;ured only by the &s;phere in which he moved. Elevated of|fices he filled with dignity&punc; and difficult un|dertakings he accompli&s;hed with renown.</P>
<P>HIS youthful e&s;&s;ay of enterpri&s;e and patrio|ti&s;m di&s;played the bold lines of his character, and gave a &s;ure pledge of his meridian &s;plen|dor. Commi&s;&s;ioned to carry, to an encroach|ing enemy, on a di&s;tant frontier, the ju&s;t re|mon&s;trances of his government; he &s;u&s;tained the fatigues and dangers of the emba&s;&s;y with the con&s;tancy of the veteran &s;oldier; with Vauban's penetration he traced the &s;ite of the fortre&s;s which was to be the future protection of the country; he conciliated the irritated minds of the Indian Tribes; and, on his re|turn, bore honorable te&s;timony of the addre&s;s and fidelity with which he executed his mi&s;|&s;ion.
<PB N="7" REF="036888_0005_100B2A1410B42368">
The province of his nativity appreciat|ed the merit of his &s;ervice, and appointed him to command the troops embodied to enforce his remon&s;trance. His maiden &s;word was not un&s;heathed in vain: In his fir&s;t campaign the laurel was entwined, that &s;ince has flouri&s;hed around his temple with perennial, with en|crea&s;ing verdure.</P>
<P>ON the next &s;ummer, General BRAD|DOCK commanded a well appointed army to repel the French from their encroachments, and we find WASHINGTON an extra Aidde|camp in his family. His knowledge of the country, his acquaintance with the Indian mode of warfare, enabled him to give advice, which might have in&s;ured &s;ucce&s;s to the expedition: But the European General, in the pride of pro|fe&s;&s;ional &s;kill, &s;purned the advice of the Ameri|can Youth; and for his temerity, he lo&s;t his life, and his defeated army was indebted to the prudence and bravery of our Young Hero for their pre&s;ervation from ruin.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ub&s;equent campaigns, the fatigues of the field became oppre&s;&s;ive to a con&s;titution not yet grown into the firmne&s;s of manhood. Pulmonary &s;ymptoms warned him to retire to
<PB N="8" REF="036888_0006_100B2A15968722B8">
the care of his friends. This interval was em|ployed to form and &s;trengthen the &s;ocial ties, to cultivate and exerci&s;e the &s;ocial affections, and to follow the leading bias of his mind in the pur&s;uits of philo&s;ophy and practical agri|culture.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH warmly attached to dome&s;tic life, and &s;upremely happy in his family, he was not permitted to enjoy the plea&s;ures of philo&s;ophic retirement. Heaven devoted him to the pub|lic, and the public demanded his care and labor.</P>
<P>FROM the clo&s;e of the French war, to the commencement of public re&s;i&s;tance to the im|po&s;itions of the Briti&s;h Parliament, the ju|dicial concerns of his country, and the milita|ry and legi&s;lative tran&s;actions of his province, engro&s;&s;ed his time. When the affairs of our country approached their cri&s;is, and the wi&s;|dom of our nation was collected to decide her de&s;tiny, among an a&s;&s;embly as augu&s;t and venerable as America ever &s;aw, was our Patri|ot. When the appeal was made to the &s;word, by the unanimous will of this body, he was placed at the head of our armies. With a "band of undi&s;ciplined hu&s;bandmen," he re|&s;trained the operations of a veteran army;
<PB N="9" REF="036888_0007_100B2A182C110568">
with nine rounds of powder to a man, he, for &s;ix months, confined them to their quarters;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gen. WASHINGTON'S Letter to the Pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s.</NOTE> and, when his &s;tock of ammunition warranted the attempt, he drove them from the fortified capital of this Common wealth.</P>
<P>YE Veterans, who followed his &s;tandard and fought under his banner, ye be&s;t can recount the arduous conflicts of the &s;ub&s;equent years of his military command. Ye can inform us of the fortitude he exhibited when every heart was de&s;pondent&mdash;the abilities he di&s;played as a commander&mdash;the appearances he a&s;&s;umed to deceive the enemy at the hazard of his own reputation&mdash;the con&s;tancy with which he per&s;i&s;ted in his own &s;y&s;tem of war, though urg|ed to de&s;perate enterpri&s;es by the ardent and &s;anguine. Ye &s;aw his undaunted &s;pirit, his boundle&s;s re&s;ources in the day of defeat; and beheld his moderation and humanity in the hour of victory. Ye can witne&s;s, that in him ambition was ever an incitement to the noble&s;t actions.</P>
<P>HIS military triumphs complete&mdash;Amer|ican Independence acknowledged, and his country vi&s;ited with the beams of peace, he
<PB N="10" REF="036888_0008_100B2A1A670A9160">
carried into the &s;hade of retirement, the affec|tion and confidence of his army, the gratitude of his country, and the applau&s;e of the world.</P>
<P>WE thought he had then attained the zenith of human glory. The prayer of his warme&s;t friend, on this point, was &s;ummed in the pe|tition, may no unpropitious event take place to fully the lu&s;tre of his atchievements; in quietne&s;s may he de&s;cend to the grave, the lau|rel unwithered on his brow.</P>
<P>NOT &s;o the will of heaven. The decree had been regi&s;tered in the divine archives, that A|merica was free and independent: The Amer|ican Jo&s;hua had led his people into the prom|i&s;ed land: But the band was wanting which might unite the parts of the nation: Our Re|public was de&s;titute of the nece&s;&s;ary principle, to give energy to her powers and force to her will. Among the Sages who aro&s;e to fix the centre of attraction to our political bodies, and to mark the zone, in which the &s;un of our na|tional life and power &s;hould revolve, was our Patriot, fir&s;t among equals. Their &s;y&s;tem we adopted, as the ark of our political &s;afety, a|mid&s;t the deluge of popular factions, who&s;e torrents had &s;wept every preceding Republic
<PB N="11" REF="036888_0009_100B2A1CCB38DD20">
from the face of the earth. Through United America there was but one voice re&s;pecting the man who &s;hould pre&s;ide in its admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>THE experiment of a Republican form of government was then to be deci&s;ively made; and the world in &s;olemn &s;ilence attended the i&s;&s;ue. On the dawn of an admini&s;tration, in which new paths were to be explored, fir&s;t principles adopted, and precedents e&s;tabli&s;hed, the friends of our State&s;man were tremblingly alive. But this new &s;phere of public action di&s;played talents, which before had not fully been called into exerci&s;e. With the eye of in|tuition, he &s;urveyed the relations of his coun|try, and with his own integrity and firmne&s;s pur&s;ued her intere&s;ts. Under his au&s;pices, the &s;alutary maxim was confirmed, that a &s;acred regard to moral obligations, the ob&s;ervance of public faith, the undeviating adherence to the plain rules of truth and rectitude, are more certain pledges of national attachment, and &s;urer principles of &s;ucce&s;s, than the &s;ubtile&s;t intrigues and artifices of the Machiavilian Pol|itician. Moments indeed there were, when we heard the hoar&s;e clamors of di&s;appointed ambi|tion; and &s;aw the dark movements of the &s;ons
<PB N="12" REF="036888_0010_100B2A1E89D62488">
of faction and anarchy: But experience te&s;ted the wi&s;dom of his mea&s;ures; and the tide of public re&s;pect and gratitude &s;et with encrea&s;ing fulne&s;s and force. The fame of the Pre&s;ident of the United States is equalled only by the glory of the General of the American Armies. In every future period of our national exi&s;t|ence, the in&s;truction to the Military Com|mander, and the charge to the Political Guide, will be compri&s;ed in one &s;entence, GO, IM|ITATE OUR <HI>WASHINGTON.</HI></P>
<P>WITH an equal mind our venerable coun|tryman de&s;cended from his elevation. He was not corrupted by the power and influence of office. He con&s;ented to become the head of his nation from a &s;en&s;e of the duty he owed his country: Every public obligation fulfill|ed, he gladly re&s;orted to his beloved retire|ment. This act was pronounced by a cele|brated Engli&s;h Philo&s;opher, as the con&s;umma|tion of character; as the la&s;t evidence of the greatne&s;s of the man.</P>
<P>HE was not long permitted, by his pre&s;ence to irradiate the circle of private life; by the &s;miles of his countenance to cheer the hearts of his friends and dependants. <HI>His</HI> &s;un was
<PB N="13" REF="036888_0011_100B2A21E0F8FE88">
not to &s;et in private, who&s;e light ro&s;e with public &s;plendor, and &s;hone with encrea&s;ing lu&s;tre to the perfect day. The maje&s;ty of our nation was in&s;ulted&mdash;her rights of &s;overeign|ty were invaded, and &s;he &s;ummmoned her venerable chief to her aid. His mind, as true to the principle of patrioti&s;m as the needle to the pole, obeyed the &s;ummons. He un&s;heath|ed his &s;word, and in the po&s;t of danger &s;tood collected to repel the aggre&s;&s;ions, and to re|venge the injuries o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> an enemy, intoxicated with ambition, and in&s;olent from &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>OUR illu&s;trious Citizen was as much di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for the reverence of his GOD as for the love of his country. Religion had a lively in|fluence on all the tran&s;actions of his life. In him we beheld piety without the gloomi|ne&s;s of &s;uper&s;tition; and devotion without the extravagance of enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>DO you inquire into his private character? Follow him to his dome&s;tic walks; the &s;cene of the quiet but refined virtues of man: With him enter the circle of his friends: Behold him in the bo&s;om of his family: There you will &s;ee all the tender &s;en&s;ibilities of the human character; and witne&s;s the exerci&s;e of all the
<PB N="14" REF="036888_0012_100B2A247B000100">
offices of humanity and benevolence. The more beloved, the more known; as free from private as public blemi&s;h. So diffident of him&s;elf, as to be induced to engage in the ar|duous duties of the field and cabinet, only from reliance on divine wi&s;dom to aid good inten|tions, and divine &s;trength to &s;ucceed laudable exertions. So di&s;intere&s;ted, as to refu&s;e every pecuniary reward for a life of public labor. So uncon&s;cious of his own merits, as in a&s;ton|i&s;hment to look around for the origin of that fame, which every breath of air wafted to his ear.</P>
<P>SUCH was the man, who&s;e death we deplore: As fortunate as great: As happy as good.</P>
<P>IN this period of expectation, when the con|vul&s;ions of the old world &s;hake the &s;table&s;t fabrics of antiquity; and threaten to lay pro&s;|trate the pillars of &s;ocial order and national fe|licity, we fondly hoped the life of our beloved Citizen might have been protracted. In his influence we confided to check the progre&s;s of dangerous opinions; and to counteract the contagion of pernicious principles. Under him, we repo&s;ed as the public &s;hield, &s;hould our country be invaded, and our armies en|countered in the field of battle. But he is
<PB N="15" REF="036888_0013_100B2A2704E9C448">
gone, never more to engage in works of patri|oti&s;m and humanity. Neither accompli&s;h|ments of greatne&s;s, nor pur&s;uits of dignity; public honors, nor national affection; exten|&s;ive wealth, nor dome&s;tic felicity, were a &s;ecu|rity for his exi&s;tence. That cri&s;is is pa&s;&s;ed up|on him, which Solon thought nece&s;&s;ary to pro|nounce a man happy. He died as he had liv|ed. His mind was fortified for the event, not by the cold maxims of philo&s;ophy, but by the enlivening hopes of religion. The una&s;&s;um|ing di&s;ciple of the Prince of Life, to him the valley of death was illuminated by the beams of revelation: The pro&s;pect of exchanging the glory of this world, for an unfading, an immortal wreath, &s;upported him through the la&s;t &s;cene of humanity.</P>
<P>COMPARE this exit with the impious boa&s;t of the great Frederic of Pru&s;&s;ia: "Glory is my Deity. Glory is the only reward of great actions which I expect. I dare challenge the re&s;entment of Heaven; for by a voluntary death I can elude the power of GOD; and in vain will the Almighty hurl his thunderbolt a|gain&s;t my tomb."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;entiment is contained in a treati&s;e of the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia on the &s;ubject of Glory, publi&s;hed at Berlin, and addre&s;&s;ed to Mar&s;hal Keith.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="036888_0014_100B2A2972F51AE0">
IN the public legacy of the Father of our country, we have the means to &s;upport and perpetuate the fair fabric of national inde|pendence and happine&s;s, which his hand erect|ed. His private Will te&s;tifies that the love of liberty in him was a living principle. He has undone the heavy burden and let the op|pre&s;&s;ed go free. As far as his power extended, he has given freedom to tho&s;e unhappy beings, whom avarice fir&s;t en&s;laved, and who are now holden in bondage by the plea of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>DOES the page of hi&s;tory contain a name more illu&s;trious than his? Did man ever clo&s;e life with a reputation more immaculate? To compare him with tho&s;e, who&s;e progre&s;s of ambition was marked with blood, and who&s;e greatne&s;s was erected upon the agonies of the human heart, is to profane his virtues.</P>
<P>IN other countries, individuals have been il|lu&s;trious as Heroes and State&s;men. The tal|ents which immortalized their re&s;pective names were united in our American Alfred; and he was free from the vices and weakne&s;&s;es, which were the &s;hades of their characters. In him were combined the mo&s;t excellent qualities of man; and in his life appeared an a&s;&s;emblage
<PB N="17" REF="036888_0015_100B2A2CACF1CC60">
of the noble&s;t virtues of humanity. "His life was one &s;tream of light," and the &s;hadow of night re&s;ts not upon it. The picture of man in him was perfect, and there is no blot to tar|ni&s;h its brightne&s;s.</P>
<P>HIS character we mu&s;t all contemplate with &s;upreme delight: In it we view the dignity of our nature; and the glory of our race. As an American character, we may all exult in it, as the ornament of our nation and the honor of our age. As the Patriot, who&s;e exalted tal|ents and preeminent endowments were devot|ed to our country, we feel the obligations of public gratitude&mdash;we are melted to emotions of tenderne&s;s&mdash;we are di&s;po&s;ed to expre&s;s every mark of admiration and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>LET the &s;culptured marble pre&s;erve his re|&s;emblance, and the &s;uperb monument proclaim his achievements; the&s;e are but the decent ex|pre&s;&s;ions of the public mind. But the &s;culp|tured marble and the co&s;tly monument are a|like unnece&s;&s;ary to perpetuate his worth. His memory is embalmed in the affections of his grateful countrymen: His name is written in the book of immortal fame: He &s;hall be had in everla&s;ting remembrance.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="036888_0016_100B2A2E3335ECA0">
