<OPENER><SALUTE>PATRIOTIC FRIENDS AND MOURNEIS!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AUSPICIOUS was the day, which an|nounced to the world the <HI>birth</HI> of our illu&s;|trious and beloved WASHINGTON. Venera|tion and e&s;teem for his character, and gratitude for his public &s;ervices, have enrolled it among&s;t the anniver&s;aries of AMERICA. Oft, on its re|turn, have her early patriots and heroes rallied round the <HI>&s;tandard</HI> of Liberty, with cheerful hearts and &s;miling countenances, to enjoy the grateful fe&s;tivity. While they indulged to plea&s;|ing reflections, extolling his virtues, expatiating on his indefatigable labours, and recounting to their &s;ons the various occurrences of the late re|volution, the hard&s;hips they endured, the dangers they e&s;caped, and the precious blood and trea|&s;ure their liberties co&s;t, <HI>the thought,</HI> that this GREAT FATHER of his country &s;till lived, con&s;ummated their &s;ocial enjoyment. This they celebrated as one of their happie&s;t days.</P>
<P>THE revolving &s;ea&s;ons have completed their circuits. The <HI>day</HI> has again dawned; and we are a&s;&s;embled. But the <HI>&s;cene!</HI> Oh! how rever&s;|ed!
<PB N="4" REF="038972_0003_1012399E1396C928">
In&s;tead of &s;ongs of joy, and fe&s;tive enter|tainments, our eyes behold the &s;abled de&s;k, our ears are acco&s;ted with the woful knell and funeral dirges, and a whole nation is &s;hrouded in mourn|ing. WASHINGTON IS NO MORE. Not the <HI>dear partner</HI> of his life only, the faithful dome&s;|tics, his particular circle of friends, and tho&s;e in public life; but COLUMBIA, humanity, virtue and the world feel the &s;hock, and weep. Tears, on &s;uch a &s;olemn occa&s;ion, are not weakne&s;s, but a virtue, a <HI>patriotic virtue:</HI> for it is thus a grateful nation embalms the memory of the MAN, whom all e&s;teemed, and all delighted to honour.</P>
<P>COULD eminence of character, noble achieve|ments, or the affections of his country, have pri|vileged above mortality, this man had not died. In him united true magnanimity with more than princely, with <HI>republican virtues.</HI> He was an orna|ment to human nature, an honour to this we&s;tern world. What mere man ever proved a greater national ble&s;&s;ing, or left behind a more excel|lently fini&s;hed character?</P>
<P>WHEN &s;o much endeared worth draws off the &s;tage, decency and our feelings &s;anction the cu&s;|tom, in ages pa&s;t, of commemorating brilliant virtue, and tran&s;mitting heroic deeds to po&s;terity. The death of great and good men has always been lamented, as a public calamity. Did not all I&s;rael weep for Mo&s;es? and all Judah and Je|ru&s;alem

for king Hezekiah? UNITED AME|RICA&punc; all alive to affection and gratitude, through every &s;tate, with all her millions of hearts and tongues, pays her departed WASHINGTON, this day, her voluntary tribute of tender grief; eulogizing his &s;ublime virtues, proclaiming the di&s;tingui&s;hed actions of his life, and holding up to view his amiable example.</P>
<P>WHILE, with the affectionate tear &s;welling in the eye, we unite to deplore the lo&s;s of this GREAT FRIEND and BENEFACTOR of his country, let us indulge the melancholy plea&s;ure of contemplating &s;ome of the <HI>leading traits</HI> of a character, which the world, with one con&s;ent, admires, e&s;teems and reveres; a <HI>pre-eminent cha|racter,</HI> in which &s;tand concentrated and di&s;played the virtues of the MILITARY HERO, of the PA|TRIOTIC STATESMAN, and of the PRIVATE CITI|ZEN.</P>
<P>SIMPLE narration here is the highe&s;t eulogy.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON THE GREAT de&s;cended from a virtuous and re&s;pectable family. The place famed for his nativity is the pari&s;h called Wa&s;hington, in the county of We&s;tmoreland, and &s;tate of Virginia. And the day, &s;ignalized in our calendar by that happy event, is February 22d, 1732.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="038972_0005_101239A3BA4772E8">DESIGNED by Heaven for a di&s;tingui&s;hed Actor on the great theatre of the world, the SUPREME PARENT of all was bountiful to him in the gifts of nature. His <HI>form</HI> was maje&s;tic and graceful. His <HI>countenance</HI> mingled gravity with mildne&s;s, and wore impre&s;&s;ive tokens of penetration, pru|dence and fortitude. His <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> was gentle, but firm; mode&s;t, but courageous; cheerful, yet re&s;erved; active and per&s;evering. True <HI>genius</HI> he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, accompanied with &s;ound judg|ment; and great <HI>energy of mind,</HI> tempered with cool deliberation. His <HI>education,</HI> though private, was upon a liberal and exten&s;ive plan, and pecu|liarly favourable to virtuous morals. And his YOUTHFUL EXERCISES con&s;pired to add firmne&s;s to his con&s;titution, and vigour to his mental &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>FORMED to figure, no &s;ooner did opportunity pre&s;ent, than he exhibited convincing &s;pecimens of &s;uperior abilities. Before his arrival at the age of twenty, he commenced a military life, in the re&s;pectable rank of Major. Being a <HI>confidential character,</HI> in 1753 he was charged with a &s;pecial me&s;&s;age of remon&s;trance to the French, upon their depredations on the we&s;tern Briti&s;h fron|tiers; and at the &s;ame time entru&s;ted with full authority to treat with the &s;avage natives. The important commi&s;&s;ion he fulfilled in &s;uch a ma&s;|terly manner, as at once evinced his great talents and virtues.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="038972_0006_101239A56563CED0">AT the age of about twenty-three, he was ad|vanced to the office of Lieutenant Colonel; and &s;oon after, to that of Colonel. In the war which en&s;ued, he was an active and valiant offi|cer. The policy of his mea&s;ures, and his &s;pirit|ed exertions, never failed to do him honour. Red&s;tone witne&s;&s;ed his prowe&s;s, and furni&s;hed trophies of victory. But his conduct, at the me|morable time of Gen. Braddock's defeat, obtain|ed the applau&s;e both of Great-Britain and the colonies. In that unhappy engagement he was a volunteer, and extra Aid-de-Camp. Acquainted with the Indian mode of fighting, and appre|hen&s;ive of danger, he &s;olicited leave to pre|cede the regular troops, and &s;cour the woods with a party. Had he been permitted, that &s;laughtered army had probably been &s;aved. But the haughty General contemptuou&s;ly denied his reque&s;t. The con&s;equence was, he was &s;ur|pri&s;ed by an attack, principally of Indians in am|bu&s;cade. A bloody &s;cene en&s;ued. Braddock fell; and all was confu&s;ion. But, amid&s;t the general con&s;ternation, under the direction and influence of young WASHINGTON, the militia covered the retreat of the remains of the Briti&s;h army, and prevented their entire de&s;truction. And we may add, through the whole of that la&s;t French war, &s;o far as his health admitted, he was un|wearied in contributing to the &s;upport of the common cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="038972_0007_101239A7F4A4E9D8">UPON the re&s;toration of tranquillity to the middle frontiers, after re&s;igning his commi&s;&s;ion in 1759, he &s;at down to cultivate the peaceful arts, as a farmer, at MOUNT VERNON. There he amu&s;ed him&s;elf with agricultural employments, till the commencement of the American revolu|tion. During that interval, he was a civil "Ma|gi&s;trate, a Judge of the Court, and con&s;tantly a Member of the A&s;&s;embly."</P>
<P>AS time rolled on, great events unfolded. At length the meditated &s;ubjugation of the Ameri|can colonies to the parent country excited a ge|neral alarm, and enkindled the flames of liberty. This ri&s;ing SON OF FAME immediately e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of his injured country, and took a de|cided part in her favour.</P>
<P>ESTABLISHED in his reputation, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the confidence of the people, he ranks among&s;t tho&s;e famous &s;ages and patriots who con&s;tituted the fir&s;t Continental Congre&s;s, in 1774. There he breathed &s;uch pure patrioti&s;m; di&s;covered &s;uch knowledge of human nature and govern|ment, and of the &s;tate of his country, and the arts of defence; and the virtues of his heart beamed &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly, that the delegates from every part of the Union were &s;truck with his greatne&s;s, and charmed with his goodne&s;s. He was like|wi&s;e elected a member of the &s;econd renowned Congre&s;s, the next year.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="038972_0008_101239AAF9643ED8">PUBLIC difficulties increa&s;ed, and the times grew more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. On April 19th, 1775, the revolutionary war began. An army was &s;oon rai&s;ed to defend the rights and liberties of Ame|rica; and on June 15th, following, GEORGE WASHINGTON was unanimou&s;ly appointed COMMANDER IN CHIEF. Powerful and regularly trained to war was the enemy he had to encoun|ter, and va&s;t were the di&s;advantages under which his infant country laboured. What were un|di&s;ciplined troops, without ammunition, pro|vi&s;ion, clothing or money, to face an army of veterans? But when, to be a freeman or a &s;lave, was the only alternative, not the mo&s;t difficult nor dangerous pro&s;pects could di&s;courage a mind like his. Confiding in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of his cau&s;e, and the God of armies, he did not he&s;itate to ri&s;k his fortune, his character and life; and, with that &s;elf-di&s;&s;idence, which is always an attendant on real worth, he accepted the im|portant tru&s;t.</P>
<P>ALL eyes looked up to him; and never was the GENERAL played off to greater advantage. Should we follow him from the renowned heights encircling Bo&s;ton, through all the perilous and trying &s;cenes of the revolution, till he obtained the final deci&s;ive victory over Cornwallis, at Yorktown, we &s;hould find, under all the different a&s;pects of public affairs, he uniformly acted the
<PB N="10" REF="038972_0009_101239AD5AB0E6A8">
&s;ame great part. What a mixture of painful and plea&s;ing reflections &s;prings up in our minds at the recollection of the various occurrences and events which took place at Long-I&s;land and New-Jer&s;ey, at Trenton and Princeton, at Morri&s;town, Brandywine, Germantown and Monmouth! We trembled, and rejoiced; but he pre&s;erved a &s;tea|dy firmne&s;s. Threats could not intimidate, filthy lucre could not bribe him. He was brave in danger, and compa&s;&s;ionate to the &s;ons of di&s;|tre&s;s. Pro&s;perity did not make him arrogant, nor did he &s;ink under adver&s;ity. Even in the darke&s;t hour, when a general de&s;pondency ho|vered over the public mind, and thou&s;ands were ready to give up the cau&s;e as lo&s;t, &s;elf-collected and &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he remained unmoved. And when re&s;ources &s;ailed, retiring within him&s;elf, his ingenuity &s;eemed to &s;upply all defects, and his pre&s;ence in&s;pired heroic ardour.</P>
<P>DEFENCE, and not conque&s;t, was his object. To effect that, and not &s;acrifice life, was his am|bition. For him it was therefore re&s;erved to teach the world the defen&s;ive art of war, refined upon principles of humanity: the true art of maneuvring and reconnoitring &s;o dexterou&s;ly, though &s;ometimes reduced to a little band, as to fru&s;trate the enemy's &s;ubtle&s;t &s;chemes, without hazarding an engagement: the &s;ecret art of im|proving the favourable moment, and captivating
<PB N="11" REF="038972_0010_101239AF030A5200">
whole armies, without deluging the land in blood. How many more have fallen in a &s;ingle battle in Europe, than fell during the whole American conte&s;t!</P>
<P>NO General ever more entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the affections of his army. To this happy circum|&s;tance it is to be attributed, that at a very criti|cal juncture, when their engagements were ex|piring, and the enemy, flu&s;hed with high expec|tations, were anticipating triumph, at his anima|ted and pathetic <HI>reque&s;t,</HI> they maintained their po&s;ts, though in a de&s;titute &s;ituation, and &s;ur|rounded with extreme difficulties. The &s;now, crim&s;oned by their foot&s;teps, witne&s;&s;ed their rea|dine&s;s to attend him to victory, or to death.</P>
<P>THROUGH a &s;evere &s;truggle for liberty, this great DEFENDER of his country a&s;toni&s;hed his enemies by the regular di&s;cipline which he e&s;ta|bli&s;hed and maintained, by his judicious arrange|ments, and by his con&s;ummate &s;kill in evading, and vigorous exertions in the hour of battle. His heart, his tongue, his pen, his &s;word, were all employed. Convinced at length of the im|practicability of &s;ubduing the free-born &s;ons of America, the PARENT COUNTRY gave up the con|te&s;t, and the glorious peace of 1783 &s;ucceeded. WASHINGTON conquered, and a nation was born. Ble&s;&s;ed with peace and independence,
<PB N="12" REF="038972_0011_101239B19922E020">
from St. Croix to the remote&s;t boundaries of Georgia, United America proclaimed his prai&s;e.</P>
<P>THE great end of the military e&s;tabli&s;hment was no &s;ooner obtained, than to <HI>di&s;band the army</HI> became an important object. Having gloriou&s;ly accompli&s;hed their arduous work, they expect|ed compen&s;ation for their labours and &s;ufferings. Gladly would CONGRESS have di&s;charged all ar|rears; but the &s;tate of the <HI>national finances</HI> render|ed it impo&s;&s;ible. Di&s;contents aro&s;e, became alarming, and perhaps had embroiled the YOUNG REPUBLIC in <HI>civil war,</HI> had not their beloved GENERAL, by a &s;pirited, <HI>patriotic Addre&s;s,</HI> calmed their minds, and prevailed with them to return peaceably to their re&s;pective homes. But, VIR|TUOUS PATRIOT! having at every &s;tage of the war paid a &s;acred deference to the <HI>civil authority,</HI> he would not at its clo&s;e have his arms di&s;graced by ri&s;ing in oppo&s;ition to it.</P>
<P>THE freedom and &s;overeignty of his country being e&s;tabli&s;hed, the triumphant WASHING|TON, December 23d, 1783, cheerfully re&s;igned his <HI>conquering &s;word,</HI> and with it his <HI>high commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> to the NATIONAL COUNCIL. The &s;ame day he filled the fir&s;t military &s;tation, and voluntarily took the rank of a common citizen. What <HI>&s;ub|lime patrioti&s;m!</HI> what <HI>augu&s;t magnanimity!</HI> Then, amid&s;t the congratulations and ble&s;&s;ings of a renovated nation, he retired to his delightful
<PB N="13" REF="038972_0012_101239B3440E6420">
MOUNT VERNON, to participate the tranquillity and happine&s;s of dome&s;tic life.</P>
<P>HERE he con&s;ummated one career of glory, quitted the field with un&s;potted fame, and im|mortalized his character.</P>
<P>UNITED AMERICA felt her SOVEREIGNTY, and ro&s;e at once to high re&s;pectability on the li&s;t of nations. The &s;un of republican glory &s;hone with full-orbed rays. Our political horizon was clear, and the pro&s;pect bright and promi&s;ing. But, alas! &s;oon the clouds began to gather, and a tempe&s;t to ari&s;e.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Confederation,</HI> that recommendatory form of government, which proved &s;ufficient during the war, while the enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit of liberty prevailed, was found to want energy in a time of peace. Through the influence of de&s;igning men, in 1786, a <HI>rebellion</HI> was fomented in the we&s;tern part of this State, which threatened to involve the Union in war. Alarmed at the &s;itu|ation of the country, a <HI>Convention</HI> was formed in 1787, for the general purpo&s;e of con&s;ulting the public good. Here the wi&s;dom of a WASH|INGTON was required. He was accordingly cho&s;en one of the members, and accepted their invitation to pre&s;ide. After four months' deli|beration, our mo&s;t excellent FEDERAL CONSTI|TUTION
<PB N="14" REF="038972_0013_101239B6F9C22200">
was completed; and, being &s;anctioned by his approbation, it was ratified by the people</P>
<P>WHEN that new &s;y&s;tem came into operation, who &s;o worthy to be the <HI>Supreme Executive Magi&s;|trate,</HI> as the MAN who had defended and &s;aved his devoted country? WASHINGTON, with|out a di&s;&s;enting voice, was elected PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. To him the call of his country was the call of Heaven. Though independent in his circum&s;tances, he relinqui&s;hed the charms of rural retreat for the cares and burdens of high <HI>re&s;pon&s;ibility.</HI> April 30th, 1789, he was inaugurated at New York; and with a mode&s;t dignity peculiar to him&s;elf a&s;cen|ded the <HI>Chair of State.</HI></P>
<P>THE en&s;uing autumn he favoured the&s;e Ea&s;|tern States with a paternal, circular vi&s;it. What heart-felt &s;atisfaction it afforded, their unfeigned te&s;timonials evinced.</P>
<P>WITH him at the head of its <HI>Supreme Council,</HI> the nation was happy. Political di&s;&s;en&s;ions &s;ub|&s;ided, and general pro&s;perity &s;miled. At the periodical election, the united &s;uffrages of a free and enlightened people continued him in that ex|alted &s;tation. Had it not been for the re&s;tle&s;s &s;avages of the wilderne&s;s, and the intrigues of foreign emi&s;&s;aries, and internal foes, our national tranquillity had been uninterrupted: but from
<PB N="15" REF="038972_0014_101239B8A4A604E0">
the&s;e &s;ources originated a complication of evils. To HIS vigilance, wi&s;e moderation, and pacific di&s;po&s;ition, we are greatly obligated for averting the impending judgments. Uniting the arm of power with the voice of clemency, he concluded an <HI>honourable peace</HI> with the Indian tribes. When, at the in&s;tigation of the enemies of government, a <HI>formidable in&s;urrection</HI> aro&s;e in the &s;tate of Penn|&s;ylvania, mingling mercy and energy, he taught &s;ucceeding ages how to quell a tumult. By an early declaration of <HI>neutrality,</HI> he happily pre|vented America being involved in the wars of Europe. When the &s;ubtle, intriguing, &s;y&s;tema|tic Genet and his accomplices were unwearied in their endeavours to divide the people from their government, and precipitate ho&s;tilities with Great-Britain, his <HI>conciliatory mea&s;ures</HI> fru&s;trated their machiavelian policy. And when an attempt was made by the national LEGISLATIVE to en|croach on the EXECUTIVE branch of government, he boldly interpo&s;ed, and pre&s;erved the <HI>balance</HI> between the con&s;titutional powers.</P>
<P>PATRIOTISM &s;eemed the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul. A &s;ingle eye to America's true intere&s;t influenced all his foreign intercour&s;e and negotia|tions, and indeed the whole of his admini&s;tration. No lucrative motives, no party &s;pirit, no bigot|ed zeal, perverted his judgment. The <HI>&s;cales of ju&s;tice</HI> he poi&s;ed with even hand. And knowing
<PB N="16" REF="038972_0015_101239BB5B7E8360">
the importance of good morals and examples to the community, he paid attention to true dignity of character as a recommendatory qualification for promotion.</P>
<P>EIGHT years he &s;hone in the fir&s;t &s;eat of government, the admiration of other nations, the glory of his own; till the political ferment was allayed, and by the &s;miles of Heaven he &s;aw America the happie&s;t of all countries, the land of rational liberty, the &s;eat of &s;cience, and every order of citizens enjoying unprecedented pro&s;|perity. There no doubt he had continued to &s;hine, had he not declined <HI>a re-election.</HI> But, advanced in years, and no pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity de|manding his public labours, he cho&s;e to retire again to the plea&s;ing walks of private life, to &s;hare in common with his countrymen the advan|tages of that government, which he had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in e&s;tabli&s;hing. Crowned with the double thanks and ble&s;&s;ings of all ranks, his favourite rural &s;eat welcomed his return. There he contemplated &s;pending the evening of life in peace, without the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought of ever being called to office again.</P>
<P>BUT this PATRIOTIC FATHER would not withdraw from public life, without bequeathing his country an invaluable legacy, in his VALE|DICTORY ADDRESS. There &s;tands recorded a &s;y&s;tem of principles and precepts, worthy to be in&s;cribed on every American heart; a <HI>&s;y&s;tem,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="038972_0016_101239BD16108388">
which, duly regarded, mu&s;t terminate in the con&s;ummation of republican glory.</P>
<P>THUS he exemplified the ACCOMPLISHED STATESMAN, as illu&s;triou&s;ly as he had before the INVINCIBLE HERO.</P>
<P>AT the peaceful clo&s;e of his wi&s;e admini&s;tra|tion, how natural to expect pro&s;perous and <HI>happy days!</HI> But oh! the mutability and uncer|tainty of all human affairs! No &s;ooner had he begun to enjoy retirement, than the di&s;tracted &s;tate of European politics alarmed the world; and the ho&s;tile proceedings of the DIRECTORY of France endangered the peace and independence of America. To &s;upport her dignity, military preparations by land, as well as an armed neutrality at &s;ea, became nece&s;&s;ary. On the VENERABLE WASHINGTON all hearts were fixed, to take the charge of the army. One grade more of glory awaited him. He was accordingly the &s;econd time, with perfect unani|mity, appointed to the chief military command in 1798. Patrioti&s;m glowed too fervently in his heart, to decline acceptance. To his honour be it recorded, his <HI>commi&s;&s;ion</HI> he received from his SUCCESSOR IN OFFICE. Though grown old in &s;erving his country, this mighty Chieftain was ready to &s;pend his la&s;t breath in her cau&s;e. A general joy announced his welcome to office, and
<PB N="18" REF="038972_0017_10123631E7000628">
martial fire began to kindle. With &s;uch a GENERAL, who but pronounced American arms invincible? Had nece&s;&s;ity called him to the field, every patriotic heart and every re&s;ource had been at his command. While his name, more mighty than a ho&s;t, had &s;truck ter|ror through the bolde&s;t enemy, how mu&s;t it have in&s;pired the brave &s;ons of liberty with redoubled heroi&s;m!&mdash;But here, alas! here clo&s;es one of the mo&s;t endeared and valuable of lives. Gods on earth die like men. WASHINGTON him&s;elf mu&s;t die. And he died the &s;ame GREAT MAN he lived. This high office he honoured, when the SUPREME LORD OF LIFE i&s;&s;ued his higher orders. Readily he obeyed; and, December the 14th, 1799, with|out a groan, "<HI>clo&s;ed his own eyes, and died.</HI>"</P>
<P>AND has his <HI>great mind</HI> fled? Does he rank no more on the li&s;t of frail mortals? Will he no longer guide our public councils, no more lead on our armies to victory? Heaven has &s;o de|creed. What mingled emotions &s;truggle in our hearts! His mourning country thinks no tokens of honour too much to confer on his memory. The world re&s;ounds with his prai&s;es. Genera|tions to come will ri&s;e up in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and call him ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>greatly beloved</HI> of men was likewi&s;e an object of &s;pecial divine guardian&s;hip. Numerous

were the imminent dangers he e&s;caped, and &s;ig|nal the deliverances he experienced. His God not only nerved his arm, but covered his head in the day of battle. In devout acknowledgment for his providential pre&s;ervation, it is worthy of remark, that in "June, 1776, a plot was medi|tated, under the direction of Gov. Tryon," and "managed by the then Mayor" of New-York, to take away General WASHINGTON'S life, "either by poi&s;on or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; and Thomas Hickey, one of his life-guard, was engaged in it." But the con&s;piracy was &s;ea&s;onably di&s;covered, and he "was tried by a court martial, found guilty, and executed." Heaven protects her favourites!</P>
<P>WASHINGTON is a name that will always bear &s;uperior rank in the temple of fame. Should we contra&s;t his merits with the warriors, &s;ages and politicians of former or pre&s;ent times, he would but gather brilliancy from their de|fects. View him at the head of a &s;mall, unexpe|rienced, fluctuating army, labouring under almo&s;t every embarra&s;&s;ment, and yet maintaining his cau&s;e again&s;t one of the mo&s;t powerful nations of the earth; and how diminutively does Xerxes appear, though he commanded the greate&s;t milita|ry force that ever marched into the field! how de&s;|picable all the ancient conquerors of the world! Their victories only added to the mi&s;eries of
<PB N="20" REF="038972_0019_101239C59DF1DCF0">
mankind. And what are the modern leaders of armies in Europe? That once happy land, they have converted into a field of blood.&mdash;When oppo&s;ed to the wi&s;e men of Greece and Rome, his lu&s;tre ob&s;cures their feeble rays.&mdash;And &s;hould we look into the moral and political &s;y&s;tems of antiquity, how imperfect were all the productions of Hermes, Minos and Lycurgus, of Numa, So|lon and Confucius, in compare with his morals and politics? And who in latter days will boa&s;t a competition with him? If ever he was equal|led, it mu&s;t be by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the <HI>Jewi&s;h Lawgiver.</HI> He was confe&s;&s;edly under divine in&s;piration, and we would be &s;pared an invidious compari&s;on of merits: but all mu&s;t acknowledge, that in many re&s;pects there is a &s;triking re&s;emblance between the&s;e two great national DELIVERERS and SA|VIOURS.</P>
<P>ILLUSTRIOUS characters are too often &s;haded with &s;ome gro&s;s mi&s;takes, or &s;tained by flagrant vices: but WASHINGTON'S will ever &s;tand on record, a brilliant exception. Through all the vici&s;&s;itudes of war and peace, nothing occur|red to eclip&s;e his increa&s;ing glory, or fully his reputation. Every new &s;phere of action gained him a fre&s;h wreath of laurels.&mdash;Not the mo&s;t <HI>perfect virtue</HI> indeed is &s;ecurity again&s;t the enve|nomed tongue of &s;lander. There was a time
<PB N="21" REF="038972_0020_101239C753F16090">
when groundle&s;s jealou&s;y, or party rage, wi&s;hed to depo&s;e him, and the pen of infamy attacked his mea&s;ures: but his uniform wi&s;dom, virtue and fidelity confounded their madne&s;s and folly. Neither malice nor envy could &s;upport the &s;ha|dow of a charge again&s;t him. He had no ene|mies but the enemies of his country and good government; and their defamation was public fame.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e general &s;trokes we would add that <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence,</HI> which graced his public character. Through the whole revolutionary &s;cenes, both as GENERAL and PRESIDENT, his generous heart declined all per&s;onal compen&s;a|tion for &s;ervices. His va&s;t fortune &s;uper&s;eded all nece&s;&s;ity; and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of promoting the general welfare was it&s;elf ample &s;atisfaction. Where in the annals of hi&s;tory &s;hall we trace &s;uch <HI>exalted genero&s;ity,</HI> &s;uch <HI>patriotic philanthropy!&mdash; Love of fame,</HI> it is granted, has wrought wonders. But no man ever appeared to be le&s;s under the influence of this pa&s;&s;ion. Be&s;ides, had this been his motive, after fini&s;hing &s;o glorious a military life, who at &s;uch a cri&s;is would have hazarded the uncertain i&s;&s;ue of another probation?</P>
<P>THE field he did not enter to conquer territo|ry, to de&s;troy his enemies, or to acquire renown; nor did he accept the reins of government to
<PB N="22" REF="038972_0021_101239C9C283A570">
gratify ambition, and &s;oar in grandeur: but he united the PATRIOT and HERO, to oppo&s;e tyran|ny, to guard COLUMBIA's birthright, and tran&s;|mit to po&s;terity the liberties GOD and nature gave. Her cau&s;e he vindicated upon &s;uch gene|ral principles, as involve the prerogatives of hu|man nature. He is therefore ju&s;tly entitled to the high appellation of the ASSERTOR of natural rights, the DEFENDER of liberty, the SUPPORTER of a free government, and the FRIEND of man.</P>
<P>WHILE we dwell on &s;uch <HI>lovely greatne&s;s,</HI> how does the afflicting thought return and melt our hearts&mdash;<HI>HE &s;leeps in du&s;t!</HI> But though dead, he &s;till <HI>lives.</HI> He lives in medals and &s;tatues, in monuments and portraits, in the &s;ong of poets, and page of hi&s;tory; but, to nobler purpo&s;e, in virtuous example and in the affections of grateful millions. Nor does he only live; HE &s;peaks, and will ble&s;s mankind to the remote&s;t ages, in his admirable "<HI>&s;y&s;tem of political morality,</HI>" equally celebrated for &s;ublimity of &s;entiment, and ele|gance of &s;tyle.</P>
<P>THIS fir&s;t of HEROES and PATRIOTS was ad|vanced to the highe&s;t &s;tations UNITED AMERICA afforded, and he dignified every office he &s;u&s;tain|ed. But he did not figure only in the field and the cabinet; his <HI>per&s;onal virtues</HI> were as amia|ble as his <HI>public</HI> were illu&s;trious.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="038972_0022_101239CC1B00CBC8">FROM the noi&s;y <HI>parade</HI> of war, and dazzling <HI>&s;plendour</HI> of court equipage, let us retire to <HI>Mount Vernon,</HI> and contemplate WASHINGTON as a PRIVATE CITIZEN.</P>
<P>VIEWED in the <HI>occupation</HI> of a hu&s;bandman, all was neat, elegant, and on an exten&s;ive and u&s;eful plan. Probably not a man in the Union exceed|ed him in a landed intere&s;t, or made more judi|cious ob&s;ervations and arrangements. Agricul|ture was his delightful bu&s;ine&s;s; and improve|ment in this honourable branch of living, he con|&s;idered as an important object. His attention of cour&s;e was turned to the different qualities of &s;oil, and the be&s;t manner and means of cultiva|tion. The knowledge he obtained in this art, he readily communicated, and recommended fre|quent and diver&s;ified experiments, as the only way to carry it to perfection. As a <HI>man,</HI> he was a pattern of meekne&s;s, temperance, &s;obriety and benevolence, invariably acting upon the genuine principles of truth, honour and righteou&s;ne&s;s. As the <HI>head of a family,</HI> he maintained regularity and due &s;ubordination, mingling economy with liberal ho&s;pitality. As a <HI>hu&s;band,</HI> he was kind, tender and affectionate. As a <HI>father,</HI> he had no children but the patrons of virtue and liberty, and the&s;e he defended and nurtured at the ha|zard of his life and property. As a <HI>ma&s;ter,</HI> his humanity and rea&s;onable commands engaged the
<PB N="24" REF="038972_0023_101239CE81F5B968">
love and obedience of his &s;ervants. As a <HI>neigh|bour,</HI> he was peaceable, obliging, and abounded in acts and offices of kindne&s;s. As a <HI>friend,</HI> he was &s;incere, faithful and confidential. As a <HI>bene|factor to the poor,</HI> he manife&s;ted a tender heart, and flowing genero&s;ity. As a <HI>member of &s;ociety,</HI> he con|&s;ulted not his own &s;eparate intere&s;t, but the com|mon good. As <HI>one of the community,</HI> he was an ex|emplary &s;ubject, public &s;pirited, and punctually conformed to the laws of the land. In a word, his <HI>heart</HI> appeared a &s;eat of the virtues; and his <HI>manners</HI> di&s;played a noble &s;implicity, and graceful dignity, in the <HI>true republican ta&s;te.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the <HI>crown</HI> of all his glory was his PIETY. WASHINGTON was a CHRISTIAN&mdash;a profe&s;|&s;ed friend to chri&s;tianity. With all his great|ne&s;s, he did not di&s;dain to be accounted the hum|ble di&s;ciple of a CRUCIFIED NAZARENE: and his life was a practical comment on the power of re|ligion. A divine providence he acknowledged in all his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and gave the glory to GOD. Stated &s;ea&s;ons of retirement for devotion he was known daily to ob&s;erve. The chri&s;tian &s;abbath he &s;trictly regarded, and practi&s;ed attendance on public wor&s;hip. Divine in&s;titutions were &s;acred in his e&s;teem, and he was a <HI>communicant</HI> at the LORD'S TABLE. Educated in the <HI>Epi&s;copal Church,</HI> he retained that form of wor&s;hip; but extended candour and liberality of &s;entiment to the virtu|ous
<PB N="25" REF="038972_0024_101239D0D669CEE8">
and good of every nation and religion. Thus by his exemplary life he di&s;countenanced athe|i&s;m, infidelity, and all immoralities; and recom|mended the practice of virtue and piety to the world.</P>
<P>THIS is the man who&s;e <HI>birth</HI> we this day commemorate, and who&s;e <HI>death</HI> we mourn. He was <HI>great</HI> without o&s;tentation, and <HI>good</HI> without &s;uper&s;tition.&mdash;Should it be &s;aid, So <HI>exalted a character</HI> &s;peaks &s;omething more than man, I would reply, It rather proclaims the <HI>true dignity of man,</HI> as it unites real goodne&s;s to true greatne&s;s, and proves that human virtue may be greatly &s;ublimated and refined. What is not our nature capable of exemplifying? It may &s;ink into the lowe&s;t depths of vice and wretchedne&s;s, or it may ri&s;e to eminent attainments in moral good|ne&s;s. &mdash;To deny him the imperfections of hu|manity, would create a ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion that all was but empty panegyric, and a piece of &s;tate policy. By univer&s;al con&s;ent, he is entitled to one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of human characters; but his <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> would blu&s;h, and his <HI>piety,</HI> even in heaven, be &s;hocked, could he know he was &s;tyled on earth <HI>more</HI> than man.</P>
<P>WE would not detract from the honours due to a vigorous and per&s;evering CONGRESS, and to a brave and determined ARMY; nor depreciate the abilities and merits of his CO-PATRIOTS and
<PB N="26" REF="038972_0025_101239D3382732C8">
HEROES. They did worthily; and procured to them&s;elves immortal fame. The pen of hi&s;to|ry will do ju&s;tice to their memories. But it never wounded their mo&s;t <HI>delicate &s;en&s;ibilities</HI> to yield up the palm to WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>WHILE we eulogize talents &s;o great, virtues &s;o re&s;plendent, and deeds &s;o noble, let it not be thought too foreign from the pre&s;ent &s;olemnity, to moralize the in&s;tructive theme. FRIENDS OF RELIGION! Let not our grief prevent devout effu&s;ions of gratitude to Heaven, for rai&s;ing up this great DELIVERER of the oppre&s;&s;ed, and GUARDIAN OF LIBERTY. Surely it was becau&s;e GOD had a favour for our land, that he capaci|tated him for &s;uch a great part in life, and brought him upon the &s;tage at the critical period of public exigency. <HI>Divine Providence</HI> &s;tands con|fe&s;&s;ed in the union of all hearts in him, in the wi&s;dom and valour which marked all his pro|ceedings, and in the &s;ucce&s;s attending them. He was a great in&s;trument in the hand of God of our national independence and pro&s;perity; and never perhaps was more glory due to one man. But it is no di&s;paragement to his worth to look beyond all &s;econdary cau&s;es, and a&s;cribe &s;upreme glory to the GREAT OVERRULING POWER.</P>
<P>RELIGION teaches us likewi&s;e to attend to the providence of GOD, in the time and manner of
<PB N="27" REF="038972_0026_101239D590D88FA0">
his departure. He was not cut down at an early age, nor in the mid&s;t of his days; but he filled up a long life of &s;ervice and glory. And he di|ed, not by treachery and artifice under cover of friend&s;hip, as Abner fell; not by an open enemy, as &s;ons of valour often prematurely fall; nor by his own hand, in a paroxy&s;m of de&s;pair, as blood-thir&s;ty conquerors &s;ometimes ignominiou&s;ly die: but, as frail humanity is ordinarily doomed to clo&s;e life, by <HI>natural di&s;ea&s;e.</HI> HE ble&s;&s;ed his coun|try, and died in peace, on <HI>a bed of virtue and ho|nour,</HI> &s;urrounded with his deare&s;t connexions and friends&mdash;And where el&s;e would a <HI>good man</HI> wi&s;h to die?</P>
<P>THE di&s;order which <HI>Heaven</HI> commi&s;&s;ioned over his life was an inflammation of the throat; in technical &s;tyle, "<HI>Cynache Trachealis.</HI>" Sudden in|deed and violent was the attack, as if the King of Terrors was con&s;cious of &s;ome mighty ta&s;k, jealous of his &s;uperior power or policy, and un|willing his dear country &s;hould have opportunity to rai&s;e one petition for his life.&mdash;Was it then re&s;erved for this <HI>grim Tyrant</HI> of our race to con|quer &s;o much greatne&s;s? No. Such honour was too great. It was not death, but WASHING|TON, who conquered. His la&s;t and greate&s;t victory was over the fear of death. His triumph he &s;ung, when, with entire compo&s;ure and re&s;ig|nation, he proclaimed, in the audience of weep|ing friends, "I HAVE NO FEAR TO DIE."</P>

His GREAT SOUL we contemplate removed to higher &s;pheres, and nobler &s;cenes of action; not de&s;tined to join the Caligulas, the Neros, the Robe&s;pierres; but advanced to the highe&s;t rank of worthies in the pure realms of peace and glory.

<P>HEIRS OF MORTALITY! With what pathetic energy does WASHINGTON's death preach to America and the world, a &s;erious lecture on hu|man frailty! "Du&s;t to du&s;t," is the common doom of our fallen nature. In every age, phi|lo&s;ophers, politicians and warriors have come upon the &s;tage, acted their parts, and then retired.
