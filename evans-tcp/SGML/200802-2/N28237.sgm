<P>Now why do&s;t thou cry out aloud?&mdash;is thy Coun|&s;ellor peri&s;hed?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE an&s;wer to the&s;e tender inquiries is legible in the countenances of all, who compo&s;e this a&s;&s;embly. Yes, my fathers and brethren, my friends and fellow-citizens, I there read the cau&s;e of your lamentation. WASHINGTON, your COUNSELLOR, is peri&s;hed. The Friend, the Father, of our country is no more; and ye have a&s;&s;embled to "te&s;tify your grief for his death." This &s;un marks the anniver&s;ary of his nativity.

this day. To other climes, illu&s;trious Shade! ha&s;t thou departed, where &s;uns no longer mea&s;ure the duration of thy exi&s;tence; where &s;ea&s;ons no more revolve; and where, we believe, thy felicity will be as interminable, as thy &s;pirit is immortal.</P>
<P>Already, my re&s;pected auditors, have we paid the merited tribute to the memory of this revered and be|loved man. In this very &s;anctuary, on the reception of
<PB N="6" REF="037640_0005_100F26C06DCCF5D8">
the melancholy tidings of his death, we indulged the &s;pontaneous emotions of &s;orrow; and, impatient of de|lay for legi&s;lative recommendation, we ha&s;tened at once to mitigate our grief by our tears, and to commemorate <HI>the man,</HI> whom we had always <HI>delighted to honour.</HI> On that mournful occa&s;ion, we contemplated him in the va|rious characters of <HI>the mighty man, and the man of war;</HI> of <HI>the prudent, and the ancient;</HI> of <HI>the honourable man, and the coun&s;ellor.</HI> What now remains? Had not that funereal &s;ervice precluded a delineation of his character at this time; it would have been precluded by the very intere&s;ting and in&s;tructive portrait of him ye&s;terday ex|hibited in this hou&s;e, and by the tributary honours then offered to his memory.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The academical exerci&s;es of Harvard Univer&s;ity, in honour of General WASHINGTON, con&s;i&s;ting of Prayers and appropriate Mu&s;ic; a Latin Oration by the Pre&s;ident; a Di&s;cour&s;e by Profe&s;&s;or Tappan; an Elegiac Poem, and a Funeral Oration, by members of the Univer&s;ity; were performed on the 21&s;t of February.</NOTE></P>
<P>In&s;tead, then, of recapitulating what ye have repeat|edly heard, and what has already been the univer&s;al &s;ubject of Di&s;cour&s;es and Eulogies throughout the Union; indulge me in reminding you of the COUNSEL of WASHINGTON, and in recommending it to your practical ob&s;ervance. A Di&s;cour&s;e, embracing the&s;e objects, will, if I mi&s;take not, perfectly coincide with the leading de&s;ign of this &s;olemnity. It will be honourary to the memory of the man, who&s;e coun&s;els we recall to remembrance; it will te&s;tify our grief for his death; it will furni&s;h us with &s;olace in our bereavement; and &mdash;what is of va&s;tly higher importance, and will give un|&s;peakably greater plea&s;ure to the benevolent Spirit of WASHINGTON, if a witne&s;s of this celebration,&mdash;it will tend to the promotion of our union and peace, of our liberty and happine&s;s.</P>

And what can more tenderly in|tere&s;t our attention to this coun&s;el, than a con&s;ideration of the motive by which it was dictated? "Solicitude for your welfare," &s;aid the retiring Sage, "Solicitude for your welfare, which cannot end but with my life, and the apprehen&s;ion of danger natural to that &s;olicitude, urge me, on an occa&s;ion like the pre&s;ent, to offer to your &s;olemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent review, &s;ome &s;entiments, which are the re&s;ult of much reflection, of no incon&s;iderable ob&s;ervation, and which appear to me all-important to the perma|nency of your felicity as a people. The&s;e will be of|fered to you with the more freedom, as you can only feel in them the di&s;intere&s;ted warnings of a parting friend, who can po&s;&s;ibly have no per&s;onal motive to bias his coun&s;el." If ye did, indeed, love the paternal WASHINGTON, if ye are &s;incere in commemorating his death, this day; tho&s;e words mu&s;t touch every fibre of your hearts, and in&s;ure a &s;ilent, may I not &s;ay a relig|ious, attention to the important advice which he then offered you, and which I am now to bring into your remembrance.</P>
<P>On this his natal day, then&mdash;a day brightened, in|deed, by yonder &s;un, but deprived of what has long given it its highe&s;t lu&s;tre&mdash;on this eventful day, which,
<PB N="8" REF="037640_0007_100F26C465F1E9B8">
at once, commemorates the birth and the death of our common FATHER, let us, like children a&s;&s;embled around the bed of an expiring parent, li&s;ten, with all the eager|ne&s;s of filial piety, to his la&s;t, la&s;t coun&s;els.</P>
<P>Viewing the love of liberty as too congenial to A|mericans, to require his recommendation to fortify or confirm it, our Coun&s;ellor fir&s;t invites our attention to Unity of government. This, &s;aith he, "is a main pil|lar in the edifice of your real Independence, the &s;up|port of your tranquillity at home, your peace abroad; of your &s;afety; of your pro&s;perity; of that very liberty which you &s;o highly prize. But, as it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that from different cau&s;es and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your political fortre&s;s, again&s;t which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be mo&s;t con&s;tantly and actively, (though often covertly and in&s;idiou&s;ly) directed, it is of infinite moment that you &s;hould properly e&s;timate the immen&s;e value of your National Union to your collective and individual happi|ne&s;s; that you &s;hould cheri&s;h a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; accu&s;toming your&s;elves to think and &s;peak of it as of the palladium of your political &s;afety and pro&s;perity, watching for its pre&s;ervation with jealous anxiety; di&s;countenancing whatever may &s;ug|ge&s;t even a &s;u&s;picion that it can in any event be aban|doned; and indignantly frowning upon the fir&s;t dawn|ing of every attempt to alienate any portion of our coun|try from the re&s;t, or to enfeeble the &s;acred ties which now link together the various parts."</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons, on which this coun&s;el is founded, are, that being, "by birth or choice, citizens of a common
<PB N="9" REF="037640_0008_100F26C6A5921A60">
country, that country has a right to concentrate our affections; that the name of AMERICAN, which belongs to us in our national capacity, mu&s;t always exalt the ju&s;t pride of patrioti&s;m, more than any appellation derived from local di&s;criminations; that, with &s;light &s;hades of difference, we have the &s;ame religion, manners, habits, and political principles; that we have, in a common cau&s;e, fought and triumphed together; and that the in|dependence and liberty we po&s;&s;e&s;s are the work of joint coun&s;els, and joint efforts, of common dangers, &s;uffer|ings and &s;ucce&s;&s;es."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How fixed the principles, how uniform the coun&s;els, of the great American Patriot! In his Farewell Addre&s;s to the Armies of the United States, 1783, "it is earne&s;tly recommended to all the troops, that, with &s;trong attachments to the union, they &s;hould carry with them into civil &s;ociety the mo&s;t conciliating di&s;po&s;i|tions; and that they &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uld prove them&s;elves not le&s;s virtuous and u&s;eful as citizens, than they have been per&s;evering, and vic|torious as &s;oldiers." May this recommendation be &s;acredly re|garded by the pre&s;ent armies of America, and by all which may hereafter be rai&s;ed for the national defence!</NOTE> Per&s;ua&s;ive arguments! calculat|ed to bind citizen to citizen, and man to man, and to cement the people of the United States into an indi&s;|&s;oluble union.</P>
<P>But, however powerful the&s;e con&s;iderations, addre&s;&s;ed to our &s;en&s;ibility, they are greatly outweighed by tho&s;e which, with deep di&s;cernment, the great Coun&s;ellor ad|dre&s;&s;es to our intere&s;t. "Here," he demon&s;trates, that "every portion of our country finds the mo&s;t com|manding motives for carefully guarding and pre&s;erving the union of the whole." He renders it undeniably evident, that, by an unre&s;trained intercour&s;e of the North with the South, and of the South with the North; of the Ea&s;t with the We&s;t, and of the We&s;t with the Ea&s;t;
<PB N="10" REF="037640_0009_100F26C8EE13B338">
the immediate and particular intere&s;t of each part will be promoted, and that "all the parts combined cannot fail to find in the united ma&s;s of means and efforts, greater &s;trength, greater re&s;ource, proportionably greater &s;ecurity from external danger, a le&s;s frequent interrup|tion of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is of ine&s;timable value," that "they mu&s;t derive from union an exemption from tho&s;e broils and wars between them|&s;elves, which &s;o frequently afflict neighbouring coun|tries, not tied together by the &s;ame government; which their own rival&s;hips alone would be &s;ufficient to pro|duce, but which oppo&s;ite foreign alliances, attachments and intrigues, would &s;timulate and embitter:" and that "hence likewi&s;e they will avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e overgrown military e&s;tabli&s;hments, which are par|ticularly ho&s;tile to republican liberty." Under the im|pre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e truths, how ju&s;tly doth he a&s;&s;ert, "that your union ought to be con&s;idered as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the one ought to en|dear to you the pre&s;ervation of the other?"</P>
<P>Among the cau&s;es which may di&s;turb our union, he mentions it "as matter of &s;erious concern, that any ground &s;hould be furni&s;hed for characteri&s;ing parties, by <HI>geographical</HI> di&s;criminations&mdash;<HI>Northern</HI> and <HI>Southern &mdash;Atlantic</HI> and <HI>We&s;tern;</HI> whence de&s;igning men may endeavour to excite a belief, that there is a real differ|ence of local intere&s;ts and views." Mi&s;repre&s;entations of this kind are one of the expedients of party to ac|quire influence; and they give ri&s;e to baneful jealou&s;ies, again&s;t which our paternal monitor cautions us to &s;hield our&s;elves with peculiar care.</P>
<P>"To the efficacy and permanency of your union, a government for the whole," he ob&s;erves, "is indi&s;pen&s;a|ble.

This government, the offspring of your own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full inve&s;tigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the di&s;tribution of its powers, uniting &s;ecurity with energy, and containing within it|&s;elf a provi&s;ion for its own amendment, has a ju&s;t claim to your confidence, and your &s;upport.

<PB N="12" REF="037640_0011_100F26CDA76C0A80">
principle of liberty, and of fatal tendency. They &s;erve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extra|ordinary force, to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a &s;mall but art|ful and enterpri&s;ing minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public admini&s;tration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of con&s;i&s;tent and whole&s;ome plans, di|ge&s;ted by common coun&s;els and modified by mutual in|tere&s;ts." We are faithfully forewarned that &s;uch com|binations are likely, in the end, "to become potent en|gines, by which cunning and unprincipled men will be enabled to &s;ubvert the power of the people, and to u&s;urp for them&s;elves the reins of government."</P>
<P>"Towards the pre&s;ervation of our government, and the permanency of our pre&s;ent happy &s;tate," we are told, "it is requi&s;ite not only that we &s;teadily di&s;coun|tenance irregular oppo&s;ition to its acknowledged au|thority, but al&s;o that we re&s;i&s;t, with care, the &s;pirit of innovation upon its principles, however &s;pecious the pretexts;" and allow it the te&s;t of time and experience. We are &s;pecially coun&s;elled to remember, "that for the efficient management of our common intere&s;t, in a coun|try &s;o exten&s;ive as our's, a government of as much vig|our as is con&s;i&s;tent with the perfect &s;ecurity of liberty, is indi&s;pen&s;able." We are a&s;&s;ured, that "Liberty it&s;elf will find in &s;uch a government, with powers properly di&s;tributed and adju&s;ted, its &s;ure&s;t guardian: and that it is little el&s;e than a name, where the government is too feeble to with&s;tand the enterprizes of faction, to confine each member of the &s;ociety within the limits
<PB N="13" REF="037640_0012_100F26D0896C9130">
pre&s;cribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the &s;ecure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of per&s;on and property."</P>
<P>Here, again, we are "warned, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, again&s;t the baneful effects of a &s;pirit of party;" and are in&s;tructed, that, while it generates "the alter|nate domination of one faction over another, which is it&s;elf a frightful de&s;poti&s;m, and which leads at length to the more formal and permanent de&s;poti&s;m" of an indi|vidual, "it &s;erves always to di&s;tract the public coun&s;els and enfeeble the public admini&s;tration:" that "it agi|tates the community with ill founded jealou&s;ies, and fal&s;e alarms; kindles the animo&s;ity of one part again&s;t another, and foments occa&s;ionally riot and in&s;urrec|tion:" that "it opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated acce&s;s to the government it&s;elf through the channels of party pa&s;|&s;ions:" and that "thus the policy and will of one country are &s;ubjected to the policy and will of another." We are taught, that this &s;pirit, however &s;alutary in mo|narchical governments, "in tho&s;e of a republican form is &s;een in its greate&s;t rankne&s;s, and is truly their wor&s;t enemy:" and that, "there being con&s;tant danger of exce&s;s, the effort ought to be, by force of public opin|ion, to mitigate and a&s;&s;uage it. A fire not to be quench|ed; it demands uniform vigilance to prevent its bur&s;t|ing into a flame, le&s;t, in&s;tead of warming, it &s;hould con&s;ume."</P>
<P>Another and a very e&s;&s;ential article in the coun&s;el, addre&s;&s;ed to us, advi&s;es us to pay a &s;acred regard to moral and religious duties. "Of all the di&s;po&s;itions and habits which lead to political pro&s;perity," &s;ays the pious and patriotic Coun&s;ellor, "Religion and Morality
<PB N="14" REF="037640_0013_100F26D2111BBAF0">
are indi&s;pen&s;able &s;upports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patrioti&s;m, who would labour to &s;ubvert the&s;e great pillars of human happine&s;s, the&s;e firme&s;t props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to re&s;pect and to cheri&s;h them.&mdash;A volume could not trace all their connexions with private and public felicity. Let it &s;imply be a&s;ked, where is the &s;ecurity for prop|erty, for reputation, for life, if the &s;en&s;e of religious ob|ligation de&s;ert the oaths which are the in&s;truments of inve&s;tigation in courts of ju&s;tice?&mdash;And let us with caution indulge the &s;uppo&s;ition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be con|ceded of the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar &s;tructure; rea&s;on and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in ex|clu&s;ion of religious principle.&mdash;It is &s;ub&s;tantially true, that virtue or morality is a nece&s;&s;ary &s;pring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or le&s;s force to every &s;pecies of free government. Who that is a &s;incere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to &s;hake the foundation of the fabric?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>How happily did WASHINGTON exemplify this part of his coun&s;el, in his official characters, as well as in private life! In his orders to the American Armies, on the ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities, 1783, he in&s;tructs the chaplains, with the &s;everal brigades, to "render thanks to Almighty God," for the &s;ucce&s;sful termina|tion of the conte&s;t. In his Farewell Addre&s;s to the Armies, he expre&s;sly acknowledges "the &s;ingular interpo&s;ition of Provi|dence," in the cour&s;e of the war, and devoutly "offers his prayers, in their behalf, to the God of armies."</P><P>On his re&s;ignation of his military commi&s;&s;ion, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on&s;idered it "an indi&s;pen&s;able duty to clo&s;e this la&s;t &s;olemn act o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his official life, by recommending the intere&s;ts of our deare&s;t country to the protection of Almighty God, and tho&s;e who have the &s;uperintend|ance of them, to his holy keeping." On his induction into the Pre&s;idency, he offers his "fervent &s;upplications" to God, for his benediction on the newly in&s;tituted government, and on tho&s;e em|ployed in its admini&s;tration; and remarks, that "no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invi&s;ible hand, which conducts the affairs of men, more than the people of the United States. Every &s;tep, by which they have advanced to the char|acter of an independent nation, &s;eems to have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome token of providential agency."</P><P>With &s;uch humility and piety did he uniformly acknowledge the influence of divine Providence, in all in&s;tances of &s;ucce&s;s; and with &s;uch devotion did he uniformly commend the intere&s;ts of his country to ALMIGHTY GOD! In this trait of character, how pre|eminently does WASHINGTON ri&s;e above the great TIMOLEON, than whom few, if any, of the ancient heroes of Greece and Rome po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed higher talents and virtues, or, in other re&s;pects, more near|ly re&s;embled the Hero of America. Timoleon a&s;cribed his &s;uc|ce&s;s to Fortune alone; and, in the &s;peeches he made to the peo|ple of Syracu&s;e, he frequently &s;aid, "That he was very thankful to Fortune, who (de&s;igning to pre&s;erve Sicily) was plea&s;ed to hon|our him with the name and title of its deliverer. And having built a chapel in his hou&s;e, he there &s;acrificed to Chance, and con|&s;ecrated the hou&s;e it&s;elf to Fortune."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plutarch.</NOTE>&mdash;Had the name of GOD been placed in the room of FORTUNE, and <HI>Providence</HI> in the room of <HI>Chance,</HI> the mode&s;ty of this excellent man would have received the additional ornament of religion.

<P><PB N="15" REF="037640_0014_100F26D440B08B50">In clo&s;e connexion with this coun&s;el to cheri&s;h re|ligion and morality, we are advi&s;ed to "promote, as an object of primary importance, in&s;titutions for the gene|ral diffu&s;ion of knowledge:" and are reminded that "in proportion as the &s;tructure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is e&s;&s;ential that public opinion &s;hould be enlightened."</P>
<P>"As a very important &s;ource of &s;trength and &s;ecu|rity," we are coun&s;elled to "cheri&s;h public credit." While the execution of the advice given on this &s;ubject belongs to your repre&s;entatives, "it is nece&s;&s;ary," as is
<PB N="16" REF="037640_0015_100F26D5E6401570">
ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, "that public opinion &s;hould co-operate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is e&s;&s;ential that you &s;hould practically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there mu&s;t be revenue; that to have revenue there mu&s;t be taxes; and none can be devi&s;ed which are not more or le&s;s inconvenient and unplea&s;ant; that the intrin&s;ic embarra&s;&s;ment in|&s;eparable from the &s;election of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a deci&s;ive motive for a candid con&s;truction of the conduct of the government in making it, and for a &s;pirit of acquie&s;cence in the mea&s;ures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any time dictate."</P>
<P>We are further advi&s;ed to "ob&s;erve good faith and ju&s;tice towards all nations; to cultivate peace and har|mony with all;" as what is equally enjoined by "good policy," and by "religion and morality." For the ac|compli&s;hment of the&s;e objects, we are taught that "no|thing is more e&s;&s;ential than that permanent, inveterate antipathies again&s;t particular nations, and pa&s;&s;ionate at|tachment for others, &s;hould be excluded; and that in the place of them, ju&s;t and amicable feelings towards all &s;hould be cultivated."</P>
<P>Having enumerated &s;ome of the many evils, which originate from &s;uch national partialities and antipathies, among which foreign influence is expre&s;sly noticed; the Coun&s;ellor, as if lifting up a monitory voice, ob|&s;erves: "Again&s;t the in&s;idious wiles of foreign influ|ence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealou&s;y of a free people ought to be <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> awake; &s;ince hi&s;tory and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the mo&s;t baneful foes of republican govern|ment."
<PB N="17" REF="037640_0016_100F26D8EC89AC20">
Our detached &s;ituation, we are reminded, in|vites and enables us to keep our&s;elves independent of other nations. "Why," we are interrogated, "why forego the advantages of &s;o peculiar a &s;ituation? Why quit our own, to &s;tand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our de&s;tiny with that of any part of Eu|rope, entangle our peace and pro&s;perity in the toils of European ambition, rival&s;hip, intere&s;t, humour or ca|price?"</P>
<P>We are advi&s;ed to "take care always to keep our|&s;elves, by &s;uitable e&s;tabli&s;hments, on a re&s;pectable defen|&s;ive po&s;ture;" and are ju&s;tly taught to believe, "that to be prepared for war is one of the mo&s;t effectual means of pre&s;erving peace."</P>
<P>We are in&s;tructed, in fine, that "there can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real fa|vours from nation to nation;" that "it is an illu&s;ion which experience mu&s;t cure, which a ju&s;t pride ought to di&s;card."</P>
<P>Such were the coun&s;els of the venerable and patriotic Sage, who&s;e death is the &s;ubject of this day's lamenta|tion. "In offering to you," &s;aid he, "my countrymen, the&s;e coun&s;els of an old and affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the &s;trong and la&s;ting impre&s;|&s;ion I could wi&s;h&mdash;that they will controul the u&s;ual cur|rent of the pa&s;&s;ions, or prevent our nation from run|ning the cour&s;e which has hitherto marked the de&s;tiny of nations: but if I may even flatter my&s;elf, that they may be productive of &s;ome partial benefit, &s;ome occa|&s;ional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party &s;pirit, to warn again&s;t the mi&s;chiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard again&s;t the im|po&s;tures of pretended patrioti&s;m; this hope will be a

full recompence for the &s;olicitude for your welfare, by which they have been dictated."</P>
<P>Can coun&s;els, &s;pringing from patrioti&s;m &s;o di&s;inter|e&s;ted, from philanthropy &s;o exalted, delivered too with mode&s;ty &s;o unaffected, with eloquence &s;o per&s;ua&s;ive, re|quire aught el&s;e to impre&s;s them on your memories, to endear them to your hearts, or to recommend them to your ob&s;ervance? Nothing, but the near and tender relation I bear to you; a con&s;cious obligation to do what in me lies to promote your political and &s;ocial, your moral and religious, improvement and happine&s;s; &s;olicitude for your united and individual welfare, in con|junction with that of our common country; and the animating hope, that the voice of your Pa&s;tor will, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion as this, be attentively heard and re|garded, could either prompt, or authorize, me to add my humble recommendation to what has the &s;anction of the name of WASHINGTON. But, impelled by a &s;en&s;e of duty, and in&s;pired by this intere&s;ting &s;olemnity, I pre&s;ume to a&s;k a reiterated attention to tho&s;e coun&s;els, on the ob&s;ervance of which your &s;afety and happine&s;s are &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>Remember, my friends and fellow-citizens, they are the coun&s;els of <HI>the prudent, and the ancient; of the hon|ourable man, and</HI> THE COUNSELLOR. Remember, they are the coun&s;els of the man, who, during eight long years, jeoparded his life on the high places of the field, in defence of your liberties; of the man, who fought your battles to gain your independence; of the man, who, in yonder encampment, "con&s;umed &s;o many an|xious days, and watchful nights," to in&s;ure your peace and tranquillity; of the man, who led your armies to vic|tory
<PB N="19" REF="037640_0018_100F2383F887E898">
and triumph; of the man, who aided in the forma|tion of your admirable Con&s;titution of government; of the man, who, for eight years, pre&s;ided over your con|federated Republic, and e&s;&s;entially contributed to its pro&s;perity and glory; of the man, who, in the evening of his days, again girded on his &s;word, to repel your enemies; of the man, who uniformly &s;acrificed his own intere&s;t and tranquillity to the welfare of his coun|try; of the man, who&s;e whole life was a continued &s;eries of patriotic exertions and &s;ervices; of the man, who&s;e fir&s;t and late&s;t wi&s;h was, to &s;ee you free, and vir|tuous, and happy. If ye will not regard the advice of &s;uch a man; if even the name of WASHINGTON will not endear it to you; if, now your <HI>coun&s;ellor is peri&s;hed,</HI> ye can &s;uffer his coun&s;el to peri&s;h with him; ye will forfeit all claim to the expectation of that happine&s;s, which his coun&s;el was de&s;igned to promote, and merit all tho&s;e accumulated evils, which it was intended to prevent. Ye will de&s;erve to be &s;evered by divi&s;ion, and rent by faction; and to become the prey of &s;ome a&s;pir|ing demagogue at home, or of &s;ome de&s;potic &s;overeign|ty abroad.&mdash;God forbid, that &s;uch infatuation &s;hould be the cau&s;e of your &s;lavery and ruin! If ye mean any thing by the tribute, which ye profe&s;s voluntarily to of|fer, this day; if ye came not hither to in&s;ult the a&s;hes of the dead; if ye have the lea&s;t regard to your own be&s;t intere&s;ts, to tho&s;e of our common country, and of generations yet unborn; ye will receive, with the ten|dere&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, the advice of wi&s;dom, and re&s;olve to honour the memory of your <HI>Coun&s;ellor,</HI> by ob&s;erving it.</P>
<P>To this ob&s;ervance, then, let me invite all, of what|ever character or de&s;cription, in this a&s;&s;embly. Each of us, my fellow-citizens, is intere&s;ted in whatever relates
<PB N="20" REF="037640_0019_100F26E033046CC0">
to WASHINGTON. If we cannot emulate his wi&s;dom, we may follow his coun&s;el; if we cannot make preten|&s;ions to his greatne&s;s, we may copy after his goodne&s;s; if we cannot a&s;pire at his talents as a General, a Pre&s;i|dent, or a State&s;man, we may imitate his virtues, as a Man, a Citizen, and a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, unitedly re&s;olve to pur&s;ue that cour&s;e, which he has, with equal penetration and patri|oti&s;m, marked out for the &s;ecurity of our national liber|ty and order, peace and happine&s;s; and keep perpetual|ly in view his own noble and &s;ublime example. Let the unity of government, "which con&s;titutes us one people," be ever a favourite object of our attention and zeal. Impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of its importance to the &s;afety and intere&s;t, and even to the exi&s;tence, of the na|tion, let us exert our utmo&s;t endeavours to pre&s;erve it inviolate. Laying a&s;ide local prejudices, let us treat all the citizens of United America as brethren, and aim to become more and more cemented into one great and happy fraternity.</P>
<P>Convinced that, to the pre&s;ervation of our union, a general government is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, let us cheri&s;h a cordial regard to the con&s;titution and govern|ment of the United States. If, my fellow-citizens, ye are, at any time, invited to a&s;&s;ociate, "under whatever plau&s;ible character," for the purpo&s;e of "directing, con|trouling, counteracting, or awing the regular delibera|tion and action of the con&s;tituted authorities;" &s;purn, with patriotic indignation, the man, who is capable of in&s;ulting your under&s;tanding; impeaching your patri|oti&s;m; and undermining your liberty. Should ye find &s;erious cau&s;e to complain of any evil either in the Con|&s;titution, or Admini&s;tration, of your government, &s;eek

If any, whom ye elect to offices of tru&s;t and authority, abu&s;e your confidence, and pervert their delegated pow|er to &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;es; ye may remedy the evil, by choo&s;ing better men to &s;ucceed them. But if, in&s;tead of this expedient, ye cen&s;ure the Con&s;titution, and op|po&s;e the execution of the laws; ye take the &s;ure&s;t method to di&s;&s;olve the union.</P>
<P>As a mean of promoting unity, and of thus pre&s;erv|ing your liberty and independence, choo&s;e &s;uch men only into public offices, as ye know to be attached, from principle, to that Con&s;titution, which your great Coun&s;ellor hath warmly recommended to your confi|dence and &s;upport.&mdash;If this advice is not expre&s;&s;ed, it is implied, in the coun&s;els of WASHINGTON; and, which is more, it is impre&s;&s;ively inculcated by his own example. At the la&s;t election, in Virginia, for the choice of a Federal Repre&s;entative, the aged Patriot rode the di&s;tance of ten miles, to give his vote for a man, whom he knew to be a firm friend to the Con&s;titution of the United States. Let this venerable Image be be|fore your eyes, whenever ye are about to give your &s;uf|frages at an election; and, like a tutelar angel, guard you from contributing to the divi&s;ion and ruin of your country.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="037640_0021_100F29A2C6580218">Let your united influence be exerted to cheri&s;h pub|lic credit; and, to this end, acquie&s;ce in tho&s;e mea&s;ures, for rai&s;ing a revenue, which the public exigencies may require.</P>
<P>Towards all nations let us ob&s;erve good faith and ju&s;tice; and cultivate peace and harmony with all man|kind. Avoiding partial predilections for one nation, and antipathies again&s;t another, let us blu&s;h to bear any other name, or to &s;u&s;tain any other character, than the name and character of AMERICANS.</P>
<P>In&s;titutions for the general diffu&s;ion of knowledge let us encourage and promote, as e&s;&s;ential to the &s;tability of the government, and to the happine&s;s of the people.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This part of the coun&s;el of WASHINGTON, like the re&s;t, was exemplified in his own conduct. Uniformly a patron of learning, during his life; he bequeathed in perpetuity, at his death, fifty &s;hares, of one hundred pounds &s;terling each, in the Potowmac Company, toward the endowment of a National Univer&s;ity, to be e&s;tabli&s;hed within the limits of the di&s;trict of Columbia, under the au&s;pices of the general government: and one hundred &s;hares, of one hundred dollars each, for the u&s;e of Liberty Hall Academy, in Virginia.</NOTE></P>
<P>Above all, my brethren, let us &s;acredly ob&s;erve the duties of Morality and Religion&mdash;duties admirably il|lu&s;trated and recommended in the example, as well as impre&s;&s;ively inculcated in the coun&s;el, of the great and good Man, who&s;e lo&s;s we lament. Like WASHINGTON, let us manife&s;t our piety towards GOD, by acknowledg|ing his providence, and obeying his laws. Like him, let us habitually aim to maintain the due regulation of our appetites and pa&s;&s;ions. Like him, let us devote all our talents, and exert all our energies, for the promo|tion of human happine&s;s. Like him, let us "do ju&s;|tice, love mercy, and demean our&s;elves with that chari|ty, humility, and pacific temper of the mind, which were
