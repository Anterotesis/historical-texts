<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONVINCEMENT, &amp;c. OF MARGARET LUCAS.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS born in the year 1701, in Fleet-&s;treet, London; my father's name was James Brindley, who kept a china &s;hop at the corner of Fetter-lane. I was the younge&s;t of fourteen children, and my mother died when I was one year and a half old; after which my father removed to Lambeth, to the hou&s;e called Vaux|hall, where he erected a pot-hou&s;e; there my father married a &s;econd wife, who, dying before him, left two children; my father him&s;elf died when I was about &s;even years old, leaving &s;ix orphans, two of them younger than my&s;elf, having no other relation that we knew of, except my
<PB N="2" REF="037858_0008_100F877B6D6300D8">
aunt, who was my father's &s;i&s;ter, and married my pre&s;ent uncle, the per&s;on hereafter mentioned. My father dying without a will, left things in di&s;order, and Elias Turner, who was one of the three directors of the South Sea Compa|ny, proving him&s;elf my father's greate&s;t creditor, &s;ent for my uncle to London, from Leek, and advi&s;ed him to &s;tand guar|dian for us. Three of us, at my father's death, were under the care of his hou&s;e|keeper, then wife to one of his clerks. She was very careful over us, and brought us up &s;trictly in the prote&s;tant re|ligion; my elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, being weakly, li|ved much with my aunt in the coun|try, except in the time of her education; and my little brother and &s;i&s;ter were brought down by my aunt, on her return from vi&s;iting us children, after my fath|er's death; but the little boy did not live long. My uncle had a mind, at this this time to have had me down al&s;o, &s;aying that, upon &s;eeing my innocent amu&s;ements, he
<PB N="3" REF="037858_0009_100F877D23B5EC08">
had a particular re&s;pect for me; but Elias Turner would not con&s;ent to it, and I, with my brother and &s;i&s;ter, was continu|ed under the care of the hou&s;e-keeper &s;ome years longer. My uncle at times repeating his de&s;ire to have us with him, and it being left to my choice, in the year 1713 I came down.</P>
<P>I had conceived the country a more delightful place than I at fir&s;t thought it, and expre&s;&s;ed to the maid, that accom|panied me, my di&s;&s;atisfaction and di&s;ap|pointment. She &s;taid with me till the re|turn of the coach, and left me a little &s;ad: yet was my uncle and aunt full of love towards me, and I was careful of my expre&s;&s;ions on the different &s;ituation I was in; but what added at this juncture to my grief, was the behaviour of my elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, who, before my coming down, I did not remember to have &s;een. She gave my uncle &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s, that he &s;ent her out of town, and, though
<PB N="4" REF="037858_0010_100F8780EE4A3070">
he &s;trove to prevent it, &s;he married his apprentice, and never was re-admitted to his hou&s;e while I lived there. On occa&s;ion of this, and the irk&s;ome|ne&s;s of my &s;ituation, my uncle thought proper to board me at &s;chool, though not altogether on account of my learning, for I was then thought dextrous at my needle beyond mo&s;t of my years; and indeed I have ob&s;erved in my&s;elf, that from a child there was a flexibility in my temper, which, as the &s;oftened wax, &s;eemed fit for impre&s;&s;ion and improve|ment. My uncle concluded I might meet with &s;omething there to improve on and divert my mind, though I conceal|ed my &s;orrow to the be&s;t of my power: he took me to Governe&s;s Hide's, in or|der to board me there; yet it thus fell out: there lived in Smythy Door, Man|che&s;ter, a widow who&s;e hu&s;band died &s;ome pounds in my father's books, and my uncle calling for the money, and tell|ing her who&s;e daughter I was, &s;he &s;aid,
<PB N="5" REF="037858_0011_100F8783EC9C78A0">
if he plea&s;ed, &s;he would board me, and I might go to &s;chool as a day &s;cholar. My uncle enquired into her charac|ter, and advi&s;ed with one Nichols, a yarn merchant, in the Dean&s;gate, who advi&s;ed my uncle to accept the proffer, telling me, his hou&s;e, if I did not like the other, &s;hould be my home; and here to be &s;ure I always met with a kind recep|tion.</P>
<P>My uncle &s;taid with me a few days, and then left me with the widow and her daughter, the only child &s;he had. I lik|ed my place very well, being much more agreeable to me than Leek. This widow and her daughter were Pre&s;byterians, but my uncle ordered me my liberty, and that I &s;hould go to church, which &s;he never forbid, though &s;he was very &s;trict in her own way of wor&s;hip, and kept good orders in the hou&s;e, with fa|mily prayer night and morning, which I never ab&s;ented my&s;elf from, and I &s;till
<PB N="6" REF="037858_0012_100F8786A05EAAB8">
remember the plea&s;ure which the books I read, the repetition of my catechi&s;m, and tho&s;e forms of prayer adapted to my years, then gave me; always e&s;teeming tho&s;e I believed to be religious.</P>
<P>I &s;taid at Manche&s;ter till the latter end of the year, and &s;pent the winter agree|ably both to my uncle and my&s;elf. In the &s;pring he took a journey to London, and as my yonnger &s;i&s;ter had been brought from thence young, he thought fit to take her with him for her improve|ment, and there &s;he &s;taid four years. Though I was left at my uncle's as by my&s;elf, I did not regret the lo&s;s of the&s;e two &s;i&s;ters, who were indeed but as &s;trangers to me, and amends were fully made by my uncle at his return, in bring|ing my other &s;i&s;ter, with whom I had lived under the care of our hou&s;ekeeper, down to &s;ee me. This gave me, as it were, new life again, for the month that &s;he &s;taid with us; but her departure went
<PB N="7" REF="037858_0013_100F878933D6ACF8">
very hard with me; and my uncle, who ever &s;ought (before I went to meeting) to make me happy according to his no|tion, propo&s;ed to take me to Manche&s;ter again. This was plea&s;ing to me, and the widow received me kindly. She ne|ver a&s;ked me to go to chapel, yet I many times went at plea&s;ure, and have &s;ince found occa&s;ion to remember what I met with there. I &s;taid with her till the town was in confu&s;ion about tory and whig; and as &s;he was afraid of the con&s;e|quence, &s;he de&s;ired my uncle to fetch me home.</P>
<P>I was now pa&s;t thirteen, and quite re|conciled to my &s;tation, growing in my uncle and aunt's favour, and in love to|wards them. They punctually fulfilled their promi&s;e, that I &s;hould want for no|thing that was fit for me to have, and there coming a dancing-ma&s;ter, though I had learned that performance at London, my uncle &s;ent me to him with others, it
<PB N="8" REF="037858_0014_100F878C36161990">
being a diver&s;ion which (as I was very agile) they &s;aid I was fit for, and indeed it was an amu&s;ement I was very fond of.</P>
<P>When I had pa&s;t fourteen, my brother came down to &s;ee me, and my uncle, &s;till &s;tudying my improvement, &s;ent me to learn writing, to the pa&s;try, and (on the return of my &s;aid ma&s;ter) to the dancing &s;chool again. This gave me a large ac|quaintance, and as I had acquired, from the teachings of my London ma&s;ter, a different air, as they term it, I generally went off with applau&s;e; and this &s;eem|ed not le&s;s plea&s;ing to my uncle and aunt, than to my&s;elf. He often &s;hewed his fondne&s;s for me at my return, taking me to his knee, a&s;king if there was any thing wanting in my dre&s;s, which my acquaintance had, and I had a mind to have, &s;aying he would buy it for me; but his love prevented my much a&s;king, for no &s;ooner did he &s;ee a new mode than he mentioned it; nor do I know that I
<PB N="9" REF="037858_0015_100F878FB2A03098">
ever a&s;ked him for any thing by which he was &s;o far di&s;plea&s;ed as to deny it me.</P>
<P>I was now pa&s;t fifteen, and there com|ing two &s;inging ma&s;ters, who taught to &s;ing p&s;alms by notes, my uncle &s;ent me to them. I went with many more, hav|ing great delight therein, as al&s;o in the wor&s;hip of God, as I had been taught.</P>
<P>Here I cannot but ob&s;erve, how many different inventions there are, to divert the minds of youth from opportunities of &s;eeking after the one thing needful; yet it was in the mid&s;t of the&s;e hurries that I began to make reflections in my|&s;elf concerning the clergy, and to ac|count them worthy of double honour; e&s;teeming them mo&s;t happy, as their em|ployment led them in their devotion to|wards God; and therefore concluded they had a peculiar advantage in the my&s;teries of divine things, and a more thorough knowledge of the Lord, and his ways to man; often &s;aying to my&s;elf,
<PB N="10" REF="037858_0016_100F879284CAAB58">
and others, if I had been a boy I would have been of their cloth, (and brought up, as my brother was de&s;igned by my fa|ther to have been, at the Univer&s;ity.)</P>
<P>About this time &s;ome particular per|&s;ons &s;ought my company, by way of court&s;hip; but it would by no means take with me, I keeping my&s;elf much re&s;erv|ed on that account, and going on in a mo&s;t earne&s;t pur&s;uit of my duties, as I had been taught, it proved a comfort to my uncle and aunt.</P>
<P>When about &s;ixteen, my uncle made me an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the family, and on the fir&s;t days, I not only read and gave out the p&s;alms, but al&s;o the family prayers, when my uncle was from home, or any way indi&s;po&s;ed, &s;o that now I &s;tood high in their favour, both with re&s;pect to their religious and temporal enjoyments; and indeed, I have many times &s;ince thought of my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed uncle as &s;imilar to Mi|cah,
<PB N="11" REF="037858_0017_100F8794154119E0">
who, we read, thought him&s;elf ble&s;t when he had con&s;ecrated the Levite for his prie&s;t; but, alas! how &s;oon did the prie&s;t not only leave Micah, but take away his image: &s;o, though I &s;tole not my uncle's god, yet I broke his peace, and left him to contemplate the uncer|tainty of that delight we fix on tran&s;ient objects.</P>
<P>My uncle now intending my advance|ment, as he &s;aid, would leave his own little, though convenient, hou&s;e, to take a larger, for the better accommodation of me and my acquaintance, of which I had a great number; he little &s;u&s;pecting this removal de&s;tined to overthrow his purpo&s;ed happine&s;s; but &s;o it was. This hou&s;e &s;tood oppo&s;ite the leach gates of the church, &s;o called, where I was fre|quently reminded of the mortality of the body, and was thereby &s;truck with many &s;erious reflections on the &s;tate of eter|nity, and the immortality of the &s;oul.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037858_0018_100F8797EA3EFCB8">
As I lived &s;o near, I often waited up|on the corp&s;e to the grave, mu&s;ing in my&s;elf how it mu&s;t be with the decea&s;ed in the hour of death; for, though I had often heard that &s;entence pronounced, by the prie&s;t, in which it is &s;aid, "we commit the body to the ground, (note) in &s;ure and certain hope of the re&s;urrec|tion to eternal life;" yet, upon the &s;trict|e&s;t review, I could not find I had any evidence of that hope abiding in me; and though my rea&s;onings would have led me to conclude it was an immediate gift of God to the &s;oul at the time of de|parture, yet my e&s;teem for the clergy led me to believe, that it was an a&s;&s;ur|ance given to them, and that the people mu&s;t build their hope thereon. But &s;till my unea&s;ine&s;s was not to be &s;o allayed, for that foundation was &s;o &s;haken, that my faith could not &s;tand thereon, and I &s;till grew unea&s;y; but although it was &s;uch a my&s;tery to my natural conceiv|ings, that I could not fathom it; yet did
<PB N="13" REF="037858_0019_100F879AD2F243F8">
I believe it was a matter nece&s;&s;ary for a Chri&s;tian to find, while in health, the bet|ter to &s;upport his illne&s;s, and help him to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the will of God in his death; and &s;urely my &s;oul was at this time under a weighty pre&s;&s;ure, and although I was then ignorant what it was, I have &s;ince believed it was no le&s;s than the drawings of the Father's love: yet as the natural man di&s;cerneth not the things that be of God, &s;o he knoweth not where to &s;eek them. I was now encrea&s;|ingly fervent in my prayers, thinking I wanted that zeal which I &s;aw in others, I made new additions to my private, and waited with attention on my public de|votions; and &s;ometimes went on with vi|gour in the repetition of tho&s;e exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>About the &s;eventeenth year of my age there came a bi&s;hop to the town, in or|der for a confirmation, which I thought was a &s;ingular good for me, for from that I conceived a &s;teadier hope and faith in
<PB N="14" REF="037858_0020_100F79CE2587BA20">
Chri&s;t would &s;eize upon my &s;oul, enter|taining thoughts that there was a peculi|ar power given to this high and holy function, from which I was to reap that which was divine; and &s;urely I may &s;ay, I doubt not but the Invi&s;ible Being look|ed with compa&s;&s;ion on the fervent de&s;ire of my &s;oul, and viewed the reverential awe in which my mind, as well as my body, kneeled to receive the earne&s;t of my wi&s;h; and I know that my behaviour, both before, at, and after that time, was taken notice of by my relations and in|timates.</P>
<P>A little while after, my uncle a&s;ked what I thought of receiving the &s;acra|ment. I told him I did not believe it was proper for &s;o young per&s;ons to adven|ture; for, as it is &s;aid, "tho&s;e who re|ceive it unworthily, do procure to them|&s;elves damnation;" I dur&s;t not receive it. He told me of &s;ome that were as young as my&s;elf, and whom he thought as unfit:
<PB N="15" REF="037858_0021_100F879EF8841038">
I told him I knew it, but they &s;eemed to exalt them&s;elves among&s;t their com|panions on account of that, which I dur&s;t not in the greate&s;t humility, par|take of; neither did I find, that my faith was &s;ufficiently ripe to comprehend the my&s;tery betwixt the outward bread and wine, and the body and blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Here I began to flag in my hopes of my having received any benefit by the laying on of the bi&s;hop's hand, and what if I &s;ay, I &s;taggered not only at one thing or two, but at all that I had done on a re|ligious account. Did I now believe there was no God? Oh no! but to my inex|pre&s;&s;ible grief, I could not find how to wor&s;hip him, &s;o as to prove my own ac|ceptance, or the a&s;&s;urance that I longed for, nor could my &s;oul re&s;t without it.</P>
<P>Here had I laboured in my inven|tions, &s;pent all my hopes, and as a per&s;on quite fatigued, &s;itting down, was made
<PB N="16" REF="037858_0022_100F87A2F9E86EB0">
to bear &s;uch a mortification as I had never before known; to &s;ee my&s;elf dwindling away from that, which I thought was mo&s;t expedient for me to be exerci&s;ed in, and that my performances were no more than &s;o many fleeting com|forts continually wa&s;ting in their fruition.</P>
<P>At la&s;t &s;o heavily went I on, that I be|gan to be weary of them, and willing to leave the burden I had contracted in my own will. I found enough to do to go on with them in their cour&s;e, for I &s;ound I had got them only by tradition. This was a clo&s;e time, wherein I was far from exaltation of any kind, for it was to me hard drawing on without faith, which I now concluded was the immediate gift of God. Under this belief I had to cry like the poor publican, "Lord have mer|cy on me;" and my &s;oul was more ju&s;ti|fied from the&s;e breathings, than it had ever been in all the weari&s;ome labours I had engaged in. But the enemy, who
<PB N="17" REF="037858_0023_100F87A5F1E112D0">
is ever near to damp the good in us, troubled me with many of his &s;ugge&s;|tions, that it could never be the way to attain to happine&s;s, to di&s;charge my&s;elf of the wor&s;hip due to God for his fa|vours; yet the more I gave way to the thoughts of flinging my&s;elf on the mercy of God, the more al&s;o I found a hope to &s;pring within my &s;oul, that the Lord would point out a way for me. This drew me &s;till farther from all ceremo|nies, and gave my mind &s;uch a turn from tho&s;e diver&s;ions I once took delight in, that my uncle and aunt took notice of it, and called it melancholy. But it was, to be &s;ure, a deep &s;olidity of thought, as not knowing in what manner or path I &s;hould be directed, how I &s;hould recover a proper &s;en&s;e of my afflictions, or obtain a &s;atisfactory a&s;&s;urance. This pen&s;ive|ne&s;s my uncle and aunt u&s;ed their en|deavours to prevent, and a&s;ked my ac|quaintance to vi&s;it me oftener; but their company &s;o frequent, &s;uited not my ta&s;te;
<PB N="18" REF="037858_0024_100F87A8AA6BE4D0">
tho&s;e nights, that were &s;pent in what I had once thought innocent amu&s;ements, were now made to procure dull morn|ings, and my de&s;ire of being alone, with the fatigue of &s;o much hurry, put me on thoughts of &s;hunning the occa&s;ions. I therefore de&s;ired my uncle to let me go out as a waiting-maid; but they would not hear of parting with me.</P>
<P>I being then pa&s;t eighteen, we heard that S. Taylor was about &s;elling off her &s;hop, and going to live at Stafford. I de|&s;ired my uncle to buy it for me, think|ing that &s;uch an employment might abate the perplexities I was in. I was then a &s;tranger to her, and my uncle, who liked this propo&s;al better than the fir&s;t, being ever ready to plea&s;e me, &s;ent for her, and in a little time after, agreed that I &s;hould have the goods, and be with her at times for my better informa|tion of the bu&s;ine&s;s and cu&s;tomers. This gave that family and me our fir&s;t ac|quaintance,
<PB N="19" REF="037858_0025_100F87AA3A55B740">
though I had not the lea&s;t thought at that time that ever I &s;hould have changed my name in re&s;pect to religion. Hence, however, many imagined my per&s;ua&s;ion aro&s;e, of which I &s;hall touch upon in its more proper place.

<P>Being about nineteen, we received an account of the death of my &s;i&s;ter Lydia, for whom our family went into mourn|ing, and I not only mourned in clothes, but in heart, for I loved her more dearly than any &s;i&s;ter I had, and may truly &s;ay, her death added to the weight of my ex|erci&s;e, as well as to my belief, that it was requi&s;ite for me to know my own election to be &s;ure; and, oh! the di&s;tre&s;s that I here was in! when I looked upon my&s;elf and others, to &s;ee them po&s;ting on with cheerfulne&s;s in the re&s;pective duties of their religion, and my&s;elf not only barren in my de&s;ires thereof, but my &s;oul &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed in the performance, that I could neither a&s;&s;i&s;t my uncle, nor my&s;elf that way. Tho&s;e that have

It was, indeed, a thing very plea&s;|ing to my kind uncle, who told me a little after, he would have me be pru|dent, for, &s;ays he, there are tho&s;e eyes upon you that you are not aware of; and I believe he was then, in his own thoughts, near having his ambition con|cerning me gratified, which was, to &s;ee me happily &s;ettled in the world, and I conclude, that at this time, the parents of my a&s;&s;ociates had generally a re&s;pect for me; for, although I was of a bri&s;k and lively di&s;po&s;ition, yet was I, through the goodne&s;s of God, pre&s;erved from that which was immode&s;t or profane, and kept within the bounds of what is termed innocent behaviour and good breeding.

This engaged many, that had daughters, to encourage my company.

<P>I now remembered I had heard the Quakers recommend people to mind that of God in them&s;elves, and to follow the teachings of the Spirit.

I an&s;wered him, if I could make &s;uch a promi&s;e, I wanted no farther encouragement than the continuance of their love; but, oh! I could not do it. We both &s;at and wept our pa&s;&s;ion out. My uncle men|tioned my leaving them &s;o abruptly, but,

<P>In one of my dreams, a man was pre|&s;ented to me, coming up to my door with a &s;ieve in his hand, and a bag. He &s;at down, and opening the bag, put out &s;ome wheat into the &s;ieve. I a&s;ked him what he was going to do; he &s;aid, to &s;eparate the chaff from the wheat.

<P>In this interval, my uncle came with par&s;on Leay again, and &s;till with hopes, from my &s;taying at home, that they might gain me; but they found their mi&s;take: for, though I &s;aid but little, I was as re&s;olute in my&s;elf, to prove the truth as ever.

Thus, in confu&s;ion, went I on, &s;ometimes begging for forgivene&s;s, and denying the fact; and when I did &s;o far recover my&s;elf, as to know how I was, I found my&s;elf, from the agony that I had been in, all over in a &s;weat; and the bed, whereon I lay, for &s;ome time after, &s;hook with the &s;trong trembling of my body; and it was a con&s;iderable time ere I could compo&s;e my&s;elf; yet when I could, I found my great God did not accu&s;e me; but encouraged the &s;incerity of my de&s;ire to look up to him, as God, who mercifully &s;aveth tho&s;e that tru&s;t in his providence; and is willing to re|mit the pa&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the truly penitent.

This immediate favour, from the loving kindne&s;s of the Lord, had a va&s;t influence over me; I aro&s;e from my chair, and fell upon my knees to receive the over&s;hadowings of his power; and &s;uch was its effect, that by its a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I did let out from my &s;oul, a few words of &s;upplication to the Lord, begging a farther manife&s;tation of his

<P>When I had waited for a time on my knees, I remembered that I had read the pa&s;&s;age, yet de&s;ired to look at it again. I had no Bible of my own, my aunt having taken it from me, telling me I &s;hould have no u&s;e for it, as indeed I had not much till this time; yet, being provided with one, I looked for the text, and ca&s;ting my eye upon it, found a great alteration in my&s;elf, and cau&s;e to &s;ay, &s;urely the Lamb of God is found worthy to take the book, and to open the &s;eals thereof; and from this time I knew it was not in my power to read the &s;crip|tures in their right &s;ignification, but only as I had the key of interpretation lent me, which I did now often receive, to my great profit and con&s;olation. Thus became I again familiar with my book, and prized that good companion

<P>Whil&s;t I re&s;igned my&s;elf to his holy will, it plea&s;ed the Almighty to &s;hew me, it was not right that I &s;hould thus be|lieve, and yet live alone, without a&s;&s;em|bling my&s;elf with tho&s;e that I was &s;ati&s;|fied were believers in the &s;ame Divine Prinoiple, neither do I now think it would have been good or right; for, as &s;ure as the Lord thought proper, in his wi&s;dom, to provide helpmates for the body, &s;o &s;urely does he conde&s;cend to qualify many of his faithful &s;ervants, to be helpful in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, to each other.

In this my aunt did not interrupt me till I had been a few times: this I might readily excu&s;e, for, indeed, I had enough to do within my&s;elf; the tears I &s;hed at my entrance at the door, and pre|&s;enting my&s;elf before the Invi&s;ible Be|ing, were &s;o many renunciations of my own will.

He affec|tionately mentioned an opportunity he had of placing me with a near relation of his wife's, who was a millener in the city, if I liked that bu&s;ine&s;s; and concluded, in much brotherly love, and with de&s;ires for my welfare every way.</P>
<P>This &s;o &s;en&s;ibly touched the natural affection I had for him, that had I not been favoured, from the Mo&s;t High, with a &s;ight of the &s;nare which my ene|my had laid for me, I &s;hould certainly have accepted of this offer, from my on|ly brother, the con&s;ideration of who&s;e love, in this in&s;tance, and of the grief I had given my other near and dear rela|tions, cau&s;ed me to turn my exerci&s;es round and round again; and to intro|&s;pect the cau&s;e thereof.

I knew her &s;tep, which made me to tremble, and therefore made no great ha&s;te to dre&s;s; but as I knew I mu&s;t &s;ubmit, I went to|wards the door, &s;aying, Who is there?

I could not but think it was a very hard allotment to me, that I mu&s;t begin this required alteration with my aunt; yet, from the &s;atisfaction which I felt in my own brea&s;t, I was encouraged in the truth, and from that time I did not &s;hrink from that part of my te&s;timony, except

This I &s;oon experienced, from u&s;ing the word thee to her; it &s;o inflamed her, that, as there &s;tood a fire-&s;hovel in her way, &s;he took it up, and &s;truck at me. My &s;i&s;ter being in the little room, catch|ed hold of it, or &s;he would probably have done as &s;he had threatened, for the room, or clo&s;et, behind the &s;hop was &s;o narrow, that I had no room to draw back. Thus was I once more pre&s;erved; but had rea&s;on to fear I &s;hould yet be the cau&s;e of bringing my aunt to much di&s;grace, as &s;he often declared, &s;he be|lieved it was no more &s;in to kill me, than a dog.</P>

I found &s;he had heard of my being advi&s;ed to leave the town; and, I be|lieve, I &s;uffered much for that kindne&s;s of my friends.

And now, again, I had the former kind proffer renewed; P. Meller &s;ent me an invitation to come to Whitehaugh, for a quarter of a year, till my aunt &s;hould be better reconciled. This was indeed a kind invitation from one that I had never &s;poken to: and I might have gone for any bu&s;ine&s;s or &s;chool that I then had; for my aunt's behaviour had &s;o frighted the &s;cholars, that their parents thought fit to keep them at home; and, had it not been for the &s;ake of &s;eeing one called a Quaker, I &s;hould hardly have &s;old &s;o many trifles as I did; but there &s;eemed a general curio&s;ity to &s;ee me.</P>

Standing, thus, as an object of di&s;dain and deri&s;ion, I could willingly have ac|cepted the kind invitation of my friends; yet, when I ca&s;t my eye toward the Cap|tain of my Salvation, I found I had not liberty to move; and, therefore, with an acknowledgement of their kindne&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed it by.</P>
<P>Another proof of my aunt's unguarded pa&s;&s;ion &s;oon after occurred, which was this: we were &s;itting together in the little room, as we very often did, and it was drawing towards the middle of the night; when, in the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation, &s;he obliged me to u&s;e that language which &s;he could not bear, and a bra&s;s candle&s;tick &s;tanding betwixt us, &s;he flung it at me with &s;uch force, that it dinged again&s;t the wall; I had ju&s;t time to &s;ee her intention, and, by bowing my body, e&s;caped the blow. Thus did David's God again pre&s;erve me, for the &s;ake of the &s;tem of Je&s;&s;e, that now began to bud

<P>The grief that I pa&s;&s;ed under, for fear

I believe my uncle had, at that time, more compa&s;&s;ion for me than he would &s;uffer to be &s;een: he had my aunt talked to, and would not &s;uffer her to come at &s;uch un&s;ea&s;onable hours again; for &s;he had &s;everal times before &s;pent mo&s;t of the night with me alone, and what I then received from her, the Almighty knows, and, indeed, did make it up to me in her reconciliation after|wards. Her nightly vi&s;its here ended, but they had been &s;o long continued, late and early, that I had habituated my&s;elf to &s;pend the nights, (as I u&s;ed to keep a fire) in the little clo&s;et. I &s;at much there, and when it was bed-time, (if my aunt was ab&s;ent) would put my candle out,

<P>I had here no intimate to conver&s;e with, or encourage me, and was left as a per&s;on quite alone; but the immediate vi&s;itations of divine favour, at times, did mo&s;t graciou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;h my faith; and when almo&s;t overwhelmed, would, in the conde&s;cendings of his compa&s;&s;ion, direct my mind to &s;ome pa&s;&s;age in the Scriptures for my con&s;olation; and I &s;eldom read, or contemplated on them without tears; yet how quickly did I lo&s;e the &s;ight and effect of the&s;e favours; whil&s;t, like a traveller, driven away from the haven of his happine&s;s by contrary winds, I was forced by grief into a con|fu&s;ion of thoughts, and have frequently &s;at under the violent &s;ugge&s;tions of the enemy till two, three, four, or five in the morning; and was &s;ometimes no &s;ooner in bed, than my aunt would call me up. It is hardly credible how little &s;leep I

<P>My aunt, though under &s;ome re&s;traint, u&s;ed to tell me, &s;he would make me &s;uf|fer yet; &s;aying, no one had any bu&s;ine&s;s with what &s;he did to me.

When my wri&s;tband was loo&s;e, my hand and arm &s;welled to &s;uch a degree, that, before the Doctor came, I could &s;carcely &s;hut my fingers. When he &s;aw my arm, he &s;aid it was a very bad brui&s;e; it &s;eemed, for the compa&s;s of the palm of my hand, to be like a jelly,

He was one who always had &s;hewn me great re&s;pect; and his daugh|ters were my &s;cholars, till my aunt thought proper to break up my &s;chool. I believe it was both from his re&s;pect and fear for me, that he took the freedom (after he had dre&s;&s;ed my arm) to &s;cold and blame me for my fooli&s;h, childi&s;h &s;ufferance; &s;aying, my ca&s;e was dan|gerous, and I might lo&s;e my arm, if not my life; yet continued &s;aying, he would do all in his power to prevent it.

It was a month after this, before I could turn my arm behind me, to dre&s;s my&s;elf.

I had but few in this illne&s;s that came to &s;ee me; yet I heard that many were di&s;plea&s;ed at my aunt. Among tho&s;e few that came, my pre&s;ent aunt, S. Whitehead, was one; and her vi&s;it was very acceptable, though I had then no acquaintance with her. She &s;poke to my encouragement, and invited me, when I was better, to come to &s;ee her; which I could willingly have done, but thought proper to delay &s;ome time, for fear my aunt &s;hould know it, who &s;pared no one, that &s;he heard did but in a friendly way &s;peak to me.</P>
<P>S. Taylor, at this time, lived with

John Winter, at Stafford; and, long be|fore this, (&s;eeing my uncle and aunt's groundle&s;s di&s;like to that family) I had de&s;ired they would not vi&s;it me often; they &s;aw my motive, excu&s;ed the free|dom I took with them, and, when I went to them, behaved to me in a loving and free manner.</P>
<P>Here I ought not, and hope I never &s;hall forget the be&s;t of vi&s;itors, the In|vi&s;ible Comforter; who, in a good de|gree, made my af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ictions ea&s;y, and con&s;olated my &s;pirit, under a belief that I &s;till was per&s;evering in the way of my duty.</P>
<P>From the encouragement that I thus met within my&s;elf, was I excited, as &s;oon as proper, to endeavour to go to meeting again; and when I was &s;o far recovered that I could dre&s;s my&s;elf, I thought, from the weakly &s;tate I was in, it would be better for me to board in a family,

that I might be in the way of getting &s;uch provi&s;ion as my con&s;titution re|quired, which never was very &s;trong, and was now much impaired by exce&s;s of trouble, and the different cour&s;e of living which I had of late been in.</P>
<P>As there was a door that went out of the chamber of my apartment into the other part of the hou&s;e, I thought it convenient that I &s;hould board with Tho|mas Turnock, who lived there, and was well &s;atisfied therein.</P>
<P>I had now &s;ome hopes, from my aunt's ab&s;ence during the la&s;t month, that &s;he would no more interrupt me in my go|ing to meeting; but &s;oon found them fru&s;trated, whether by accident or information, I know not; for, one day, when I came to the corner, near my uncle's hou&s;e, I &s;aw her com|ing towards me: the thoughts of the Doctor and my arm quickly occured;

As I was at liberty, it &s;eemed right to keep &s;o, and make the be&s;t of my way; yet, &s;o fettered did I find my|&s;elf, that, before I had gone many yards I faultered in my purpo&s;e, and my aunt got up with me, before I was half way to the meeting.</P>
<P>I now &s;aw my mi&s;take, and that it would have been better if my aunt had overtaken me &s;ooner; for the place looked dangerous, and the want of room to &s;hake and pu&s;h me about in, gave me many apprehen&s;ions that &s;he would throw me headlong down the pre|cipice. It was about the time that friends were going into the meeting, and this vexed her the more; for I have rea|&s;on to believe &s;he could not endure the &s;ight of a friend, on my account. She did not &s;pare to tell me of hurting my arm, nor to &s;hake me by it; but as it had

<P>Thus, with many admonitions and ex|hortations, as &s;he called them, &s;he kept me till &s;uch time as &s;he might expect the meeting would break up, and then left me.</P>
<P>As I was at liberty, I went towards the meeting, and, as it was not over, &s;tepped within, that my aunt might know that my intention was re&s;olute. This &s;eemed to be as a renewal of our acquaintance, for &s;he &s;oon returned her vi&s;its as u&s;ual, though not at the former un&s;ea&s;onable hours.</P>
<P>I have, many times, &s;eriou&s;ly reflected how it was with me in the&s;e &s;traights,

and may acknowledge, my compo&s;ure of &s;oul was owing to a divine power, which &s;tayed my mind on God, and kept down tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of nature, which other|wi&s;e might have exceeded their bounds. But, oh! the calmne&s;s and tranquillity that did in the&s;e times of trial po&s;&s;e&s;s my heart, whil&s;t innocency prevailed over &s;hame; and I found, by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the&s;e le&s;&s;ons of mortification, that I grew in patience and re&s;ignation, in the de&s;ire after the Lord's favour, and the manife&s;|tation of his will, who had wrought my heart into &s;o good a degree of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that I was willing to undergo, or be termed any thing, rather than lo&s;e the enjoyment of that in which I had now got a &s;mall po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was about this time that I knew an extacy of joy at the freely giving up my name to that, which I once thought the mo&s;t de&s;picable. There came a Lon|don harberda&s;her to my &s;hop, with whom

I dealt in my way of bu&s;ine&s;s: he ap|proached me in his accu&s;tomary manner; and I, not an&s;wering his compliment, as u&s;ual, he looked full at me, and &s;aid, Are you a Quaker? My &s;oul was &s;truck by this home que&s;tion; I &s;olemnly an|&s;wered, yes; and immediately a &s;pring of joy &s;eized my heart, accompanied with this de&s;ire, viz.

<P>From this time I found my de&s;ires were &s;trengthened, and the ambition of being an I&s;raelite, run in the current of my exerci&s;e.

So many cro&s;s words and knotty queries lay in the way of all I &s;eemed to have to do, that nature was aba&s;hed, almo&s;t be|yond the hope of recovery; yet I often contemplated the benefit that accrued to Zaccheus from that mo&s;t heavenly call, Make ha&s;te, and come down: and how willingly would I have made my &s;itua|tion &s;imilar to his; believing there was &s;omething in that call alluding to the glories of eternity; which now appeared in brighter lu&s;tre to my eye, than all the glittering objects of a tran&s;itory life.

Whil&s;t I was mu|&s;ing on the&s;e things, a me&s;&s;enger came and told me, that although my aunt was there, if I thought it convenient, he would come to &s;ee me. I he&s;itated a little, to prove what would be be&s;t. I knew my aunt's weakne&s;s, that &s;he would not &s;pare me, or mind, in her pa&s;|&s;ion, what &s;he expre&s;&s;ed; yet hoped, as it was his de&s;ire to come, he would ex|cu&s;e what might fall upon him&s;elf, and &s;ee through the fal&s;ities &s;he might ca&s;t on me.</P>
<P>In this conclu&s;ion I de&s;ired his com|pany,

and my aunt being pre&s;ent, &s;aid &s;he would &s;tay to &s;ee this friend. On his knocking, I let him in, with a degree of fear, and watched to hear the &s;aluta|tion &s;he gave him; which was, "Thou deceiver! thou antichri&s;t! thou ha&s;t &s;e|duced this &s;illy wretch." Had &s;he known what my heart could have told her, &s;he might have thought differently; for, on the appearance of the friend, I was made very &s;en&s;ible of that power by which I had been drawn into the truth.</P>
<P>He endeavoured to &s;hew her the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of her charge, by a&s;&s;uring her, he had never had any conver&s;ation with me, nor had vi&s;ited me before. She an&s;wered, If thou ha&s;t not, thy brethren have, and was run|ning on with violence again&s;t the Qua|kers; he &s;till tried to engage her atten|tion, by reminding her that his mother and &s;he u&s;ed, as neighbours, to be ac|quainted. She &s;ignified that was true
<PB N="87" REF="037858_0093_100F88636DED89B0">
and if ever there was a good Quaker in the world, his mother was one.</P>
<P>She kept walking between the &s;hop and the clo&s;et, laying many heavy things to my charge, which I had learned with &s;ilence to bear, till &s;he touched my mo|de&s;ty, and told the friend the freedom which, &s;he &s;aid, I gave to young men; then I de&s;ired her to keep to the truth; and &s;he &s;aid, If I &s;poke another word, &s;he would knock my head to the wall, which, I well knew, a word or two more would have aggravated her to have done. Upon his a&s;king how long I had been &s;o bad, &s;he &s;aid, ever &s;ince I had been de|luded; for I was well enough before I was bewitched.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he went on, as long, I believe, as &s;he had power; for, going out &s;he &s;aid, I will go, but I will come again: but &s;he came no more till next day, when &s;he laid on me with blows, &s;aying

that I &s;ent for the friend on purpo&s;e to vex her. She &s;hewed &s;o much of her pa&s;&s;ion, as to make the friend &s;ignify to me, that he could think no other than that &s;he was out of her &s;en&s;es; and that he could not &s;ee, if I had not truth for my foundation, how it was po&s;&s;ible for me to &s;tand. I told him that I had no other view of coming among&s;t friends, than to procure the truth and peace of God unto my &s;oul; and that I had &s;till hopes I &s;hould be pre&s;erved. I remember, he ob&s;erved to me, the emptine&s;s of a bar|ren profe&s;&s;ion; and advi&s;ed me to wait on God in the &s;ecret of my heart, to rely on his wi&s;dom, and to tru&s;t in his power, &s;ignifying a de&s;ire that I might be pre&s;erved; and adding, he had come to &s;ee me &s;ooner, but found him&s;elf en|gaged to take the apo&s;tle's advice, to "lay hands &s;uddenly on no one;" and, after kindly inviting me to his hou&s;e, took leave.

When he was gone, I con&s;idered what had pa&s;&s;ed, and was thankful to the Great Di&s;po&s;er of all things. I thought there was &s;omewhat extraordinary in my aunt's leaving us, for &s;he had never left me with any per&s;on before, and was glad I had an opportunity of gaining &s;uch in&s;truction, the like of which I never had before received in conver&s;ation; nor could I le&s;s admire the friend's pru|dent care, in ob&s;erving the apo&s;tle's ad|vice, which I had before time thought alluded only to the laying on of the bi&s;hop's hands, at the time of the young &s;tudent's admi&s;&s;ion into holy orders, and the confirmation of the youth; but now I knew, by experience, that, for want of prudence in particulars, I had been a &s;ufferer; and, as an in&s;tance, &s;hall men|tion one of the mo&s;t unea&s;y meetings I ever was at, which was occa&s;ioned by a friend's overcare, who had often pre&s;&s;ed me to come up higher in the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ting than where I frequently &s;at.

to that friend, that the highe&s;t place in the meeting would be as little regarded by my aunt as the lowe&s;t, &s;hould &s;he be inclined to make a di&s;turbance there; yet, by frequent importunity, being will|ing to &s;hew &s;ome re&s;pect to my friend's advice, I was prevailed with to advance a form or two; but when the friend came and &s;aw I had not thoroughly taken her advice, &s;he plucked me by the arm; and although I &s;ignified my de&s;ire of &s;itting &s;till, as far as civility would bear, yet &s;he compelled me to ri&s;e, and, notwith|&s;tanding I &s;hewed a de&s;ire of turning in at the next, and the next &s;eat I came to, yet &s;he would not let me re&s;t, till &s;he had placed me by her&s;elf. Then, oh! the hurries that my mind was in; for &s;urely, had my aunt her&s;elf been there, &s;he could not have confu&s;ed my thoughts half &s;o much; for though, at this time, when at meetings, I had a de&s;ire to draw nigh to fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ds in &s;pirit, yet it went much again&s;t my inclination to &s;it &s;o near the

place which, my aunt u&s;ed to tell me, mu&s;t be my &s;eat; &s;aying, all pro&s;elytes mu&s;t be made preachers, and tell to the brethren the abominations of the wicked. Often would &s;he tea&s;e me with &s;uch things; well knowing, I had in my na|ture a great aver&s;ion to woman's preach|ing.</P>
<P>Here I &s;at, in a re&s;tle&s;s condition, &s;e|veral times purpo&s;ing to go out; yet the kindne&s;s I had for my friend prevailed on me to &s;tay. Glad, however, was I when the meeting broke up; and when it was over, the friend gave me her hand; which I an&s;wered with my own, in token of my forgiving her too forward, though loving, fault; yet not without telling her, when at home, the trouble she had given me, and de&s;iring her never to u&s;e me &s;o hardly again.</P>
<P>Shall I here &s;ay, that good came out of evil; no &s;ure, but &s;weet came out of

bitter; for, by my friend's freedom of giving me her hand, &s;everal that were in the meeting did the &s;ame; and though this did not prove a time of confirmation to my faith, but rather otherwi&s;e; yet it &s;eemed like a &s;ign of union, no one hav|ing done &s;o before, and was plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>But I lo&s;t, for a time, the deep impre&s;|&s;ion, which the friend's apprehen&s;ion of my aunt's being di&s;tracted, had made on my mind; but thought, afterwards, if, from the little he &s;aw, he could not but entertain apprehen&s;ions of that kind, what had I to fear, who had &s;een her &s;o many times, a great deal wor&s;e; yet, what could I do, or what was there to be done; I could not renounce my &s;alva|tion in order to appea&s;e my aunt.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections cau&s;ed di&s;tre&s;s in my countenance, which occa&s;ioned my aunt to &s;ay, she read the very Quaker in my face.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="037858_0099_100F79DBF0488CC8">
It &s;eemed hardly po&s;&s;ible I could ever know any &s;orrow like that I then felt; and my aunt, either by informa|tion, or her own ob&s;ervation, became acquainted with it; and by many frantic ge&s;tures, wrought in me a belief, that she was really as I imagined. My &s;oul now fled to the Almighty for refuge, and I &s;at before her a witne&s;s of her frenzi|cal behaviour, with more &s;olidity and compo&s;ure than she expected. At la&s;t, she came up to me, and &s;aid, I am mad; thou, thou ha&s;t driven me mad! and I am mad! I was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear her &s;ay &s;o, and thought there was &s;ome hopes for me, as she had yet &s;o much rea&s;on left as to tell me of the thing she knew I was &s;o afraid of.</P>
<P>Upon my shewing &s;o much indiffer|ence about it, she dropt that &s;cheme, and in a little time after, as one fainting in her hopes of victory, declined inter|rupting me in the &s;treet; yet, being
<PB N="94" REF="037858_0100_100F886FEC6AE150">
willing to ob&s;truct my de&s;ire of going to meeting, she would come to my room before the hour appointed; telling me, we would have a &s;ilent meeting. I would gladly have had her kept to it, but it &s;eemed an impo&s;&s;ibility, on her part.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw it was her intention, by this means, to keep me at home; in order to prevent it, I &s;et out &s;o much the &s;ooner; and &s;he, on the other hand, came earlier &s;till, till &s;he &s;aw, without &s;he ro&s;e &s;ooner in the morning, my re&s;olutions would outgo her.</P>
<P>Many were the paces which I was forced to take in the fields on this ac|count; but I may &s;ay my labour was not in vain, for my aunt then left me to my liberty, and many precious meetings I enjoyed.</P>
<P>As I had nothing of tradition, when
<PB N="95" REF="037858_0101_100F8873D8DD5B40">
there, to tru&s;t to, my earne&s;t de&s;ire was to &s;eek the Lord, and he was found of my &s;oul, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible con&s;olation.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to &s;ilent meetings, my &s;pi|ritual exerci&s;es at home had taught me how to improve by them: my heart in|clined rather to &s;it in fear and reverence, and to watch again&s;t the tumult of un|nece&s;&s;ary thoughts, than to be bu&s;y, as formerly, in the florid appearances of lip-wor&s;hip. But, yet, I would not have it &s;uppo&s;ed, that I knew no diffi|culty in my exerci&s;es; for &s;urely, I often felt the throng of natural cogita|tions to pre&s;s &s;o hard upon me, that I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound cau&s;e to implore the divine aid, often breathing forth this ejacula|tion; Lord, if thou keep not the city, the watchman waketh but in vain!</P>
<P>But though I was freed from my aunt's mole&s;tations, I found it was only as the changing of a &s;cene, and that the
<PB N="96" REF="037858_0102_100F8876746C4DA8">
&s;ubtilty of the &s;erpent was now more dangerous to me than it had been in the form of the lion.</P>
<P>My freedom of attending meeting, which I had hitherto been much re|&s;trained from, and the Lord's merci|fully &s;ubduing tho&s;e &s;pirits which were a hinderance to me, in the way of my &s;oul's &s;erenity, I could not but grate|fully acknowledge, with de&s;ires that I might an&s;wer the obligation. But I was yet inexperienced in the craft of the enemy and deceiver of men, and needed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome prudent confident, who&s;e coun&s;el might have &s;et right bounds to my zeal.</P>
<P>This &s;ubtile one, taking advantage of my earne&s;tne&s;s cunningly twined a thread of his own into that work which I was endeavouring to render acceptable to my God. I had, till this time, been taken up in &s;eeking after an increa&s;e and e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
<PB N="97" REF="037858_0103_100F8879098491B8">
in the knowledge of the truth, and in keeping up a &s;trict circum&s;pection in my behaviour, that thereby I might not give my relations and acquaintance ju&s;t occa&s;ion of trouble, or a pretence for villifying the way of truth.</P>
<P>I had not as yet made any great ob|&s;ervations on dre&s;s, but thought to make a &s;tand, and judge what was be&s;t to be done; and, doubtle&s;s &s;o far I was in the right, whil&s;t I made &s;ome alterations.</P>
<P>But now I found the prowling adver|&s;ary, what he ever was, a malicious, de|ceitful, twining &s;erpent, who, if he can but get in his head at the lea&s;t place of our inadvertency, will &s;oon draw in his body, under an appearance of &s;anctity, to effect, if po&s;&s;ible, the utter de&s;truc|tion of the &s;oul. He &s;aw that his aim of drawing me into any gro&s;s, obvious evil, was defeated; and as I had &s;een le&s;s of his &s;tratagems in the angelical

<P>In le&s;s than one week, I made &s;everal &s;acrifices of value; and &s;o hurried was I in this blind zeal, that I &s;eemed impa|tient for more fuel. And having gone through, as I thought, at home; I next let out the bu&s;y eye on others. There were but &s;ew who could e&s;cape my judgment, forgetting that tender advice, vi. Luke, 37, "Judge not, and ye &s;hall not be judged; condemn not, and ye &s;hall not be condemned." I noticed each point of behaviour and apparel: till, &s;o great a critic was I got, that I &s;eemed all &s;peculation on the more mi|nute things; and neglecting the weightier
<PB N="99" REF="037858_0105_100F887D34BD6F30">
matters, as faith, mercy, and the love of God, which, &s;urely, I ought to have re|garded, though not to have left the other wholly undone.</P>
<P>To what extravagancy I had gone in this line, the mo&s;t penetrating eye be&s;t &s;aw, and was plea&s;ed to look in compa&s;&s;ion on the mi&s;take of my intentions, and mo&s;t graciou&s;ly to illumine my under&s;tanding; giving me plainly to &s;ee, I was quite out of that charity, without which, the apo&s;|tle &s;ays, all our works profit nothing.</P>
<P>So tenaciou&s;ly did I adhere to this thing, that I &s;aw not the deceiver, till I di&s;covered &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions predominant in me, as I had never ob&s;erved before. My temper became uncharitable, and unmer|ciful, looking with an evil eye on the in|nocent; and being incapable of either plea&s;ing my&s;elf or being plea&s;ed with others; but, according to the greatne&s;s of my error herein, &s;o was my aba&s;ement,

<P>Now was I filled with &s;hame; the &s;er|pent had beguiled me, and by his cun|ning he had given me more unea&s;ine&s;s than by all his roaring. I acknowledged my fault, I begged forgivene&s;s and future protection of the Almighty, who in his great conde&s;cention, made up the breach and re&s;tored the path to walk in.

<P>Thus was I fully &s;atisfied concerning my father's debt; and, in a little time af|ter, was comfortably a&s;tonished with the breathings in of the love of God, in the&s;e few comprehen&s;ive words; Fear not, I have overcome the world. Had my trouble been even redoubled, like Job's, &s;urely I should in this &s;ea&s;on of favour have forgotten them; yet, when it &s;ub&s;ided, I found there remained two occa&s;ions for &s;orrowful reflection. The one was, paying of my creditors; which I &s;oon got over, as I had cash enough to balance all but one, from whom I had received a parcel, which, through the &s;mallne&s;s of bu&s;ine&s;s, was nearly entire; and this I &s;ent back, with money to an|&s;wer any deficiency or damage. It was kindly received, and I was very ea&s;y re&s;pecting it. But as to the other affair, by de&s;troying the articles, I had put it
<PB N="104" REF="037858_0110_100F888CA2ECF2D0">
out of my power to re&s;tore them; and this dwelt longer with me; yet, as I lived to come to age, I took the debt upon my&s;elf, and became reconciled to bear it; though not without a belief, that if I had had a friend to have given me ad|vice, it would have been otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Here I bemoaned my&s;elf, before the Almighty, that I had lo&s;t my parents, di&s;obliged my relations, and now had no friend to take more notice of me than what is common among&s;t the generality of profe&s;&s;ors; and, indeed, how could I expect, that any one would bu&s;y them|&s;elves to take the care of me, in any degree upon them, without my de&s;ire?</P>
<P>I became more and more &s;en&s;ible of the danger to which my years, as well as other circum&s;tances, might expo&s;e me; and I preferred many &s;trong de&s;ires to the Mo&s;t High, that, in his wi&s;dom he would appoint for me a faithful friend,

not knowing why it &s;hould be thus; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">earing I was dying to all that was &s;piritual, I at length re&s;olved to make application to my friend.</P>
<P>I went to his hou&s;e; and remember, while I waited a &s;uitable opportunity to &s;peak to him, the tears trickled down my cheeks; yet, when I had unbo&s;omed my complaint, I received great &s;atisfac|tion; for, from his kind enquiry of my pa&s;t conduct, I found my opinion of his friend&s;hip confirmed. From his tender advice my &s;oul was encouraged to hope a little longer: and to my inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, in &s;ome days after, I felt the influ|ence of Divine Love &s;ugge&s;ting to my mind, Follow on to know the Lord; Jo|&s;eph, the &s;piritual Jo&s;eph, is yet alive. Oh! &s;ure here I found again that ine&s;ti|mable jewel, the pearl of my be&s;t affec|tion, and the life of my hope, with &s;uch revivings as Jacob experienced, when he &s;aw the a&s;&s;urance of the welfare of his

&s;on. And my &s;oul bowed under an humble &s;en&s;e of gratitude; &s;aying, It is enough, I will go down and &s;ee him ere I die.</P>
<P>It was a time of true humility, tender|ne&s;s, and love. My covenant was re|newed, and it remained for &s;ome time as a &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on; or, "as the time when the voice of the turtle is heard." Yet, at in|tervals, I could not but reflect on former days, and conclude, the &s;malle&s;t degree of my uncle's and aunt's reconciliation, would add to my happine&s;s. And, as the&s;e thoughts increa&s;ed, &s;o did my de&s;ire of making a trial; and, one evening, I went to their hou&s;e, and knocked at the door, &s;tranger-like, as indeed I was, not having been there for above two years.</P>
<P>Their maid let me in; and, I &s;uppo&s;e I much &s;urpri&s;ed them. They were &s;it|ting alone by the fire. I ju&s;t &s;aid. How do you do? and &s;tood within the hou&s;e,

a little di&s;tant from the door. My uncle looked very &s;orrowful, and if he &s;poke at that time, he only &s;aid, I have no plea&s;ure in &s;eeing thee. My aunt &s;aid enough, and called me many impu|dencies for coming. I &s;tood about half an hour, and then bidding them farewell, my aunt came with me part of the way back, &s;colding me as we went.</P>
<P>I thought this was but poor encourage|ment, yet was truly glad I had &s;een them.</P>
<P>In about &s;ix weeks, I had a de&s;ire to go again. I went in the former manner, knocked, and &s;tood as before; and, after a little while, my uncle &s;aid, Thou may|e&s;t &s;it down. My aunt then fetched &s;ome books, which, I believe, were the &s;ame that Bennet would have lent me, and read &s;everal ab&s;urd pa&s;&s;ages; to which I only &s;aid, I hope you do not think any &s;ect can be &s;o ridiculous as to believe and practi&s;e tho&s;e things. I &s;taid a little

longer than before, during which my uncle &s;at very &s;olitary, and my aunt let me come home quietly.</P>
<P>Thus I went &s;everal times to &s;ee them, eyeing my permi&s;&s;ion; as believing, that to go without it, might expo&s;e me to danger; but, in my fourth or fifth vi&s;it, my uncle &s;aid to the maid; Set her &s;ome|thing to eat. I could truly have &s;aid his love was &s;ufficient; for I was &s;o &s;atisfied, with this little return of his love, and my aunt's increa&s;ed quietne&s;s, that my heart was ready to overflow. I thought proper to go to the table, and, before I ate, there was a contrite than&s;giving aro&s;e in my &s;oul to God.</P>
<P>After this, I took the liberty to go at &s;undry times to &s;ee them, and had frequent opportunities to remark, I &s;till had a place in their affection; which an|&s;wered my de&s;ire; nor could I hope for more, as there always was, and is, a con|trariety

betwixt the &s;piritual and natural di&s;po&s;itions. They were &s;o kind as to return my vi&s;its, till I was married, [to S. L. the hu&s;band's name] which was a little pa&s;t the twenty-fourth year of my age, with the approbation of my friends.</P>
<P>My uncle would not come to the meeting, but came to our dinner; and my aunt vi&s;ited us the next day. They both behaved loving and affectionate to my hu&s;band; and, afterwards, were very tender of our children, my aunt exceed|ingly &s;o; and, indeed, it yields me &s;atisfac|tion, as often as I remember the public te&s;timonies &s;he gave, before her death, of my behaviour towards her in the time of my convincement; though, I believe, &s;he continued to think it was right in her to re&s;train me from going on in a way &s;o different from her own judgment, and what &s;he thought was right; yet ac|knowledged &s;he was angry, and did ex|ceed;
<PB N="113" REF="037858_0119_100F88A4F2C84650">
and that &s;he never &s;aw me behave unbecoming, or heard me give her an unhand&s;ome word. She was, again, as civil to friends as before I went to meet|ings; and at times a&s;ked &s;everal friends of my acquaintance to her hou&s;e, and enter|tained them freely.</P>
<P>I may now conclude my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rrative thus far, with truly &s;aying, how ble&s;&s;ed in my &s;ituation was I; having a loving, kind and tender hu&s;band; our lawful endeavours made pro&s;perous; the affec|tions of my relations re&s;tored; and, above all, the ble&s;&s;ing of the Almighty &s;ancti|fying the&s;e enjoyments to my &s;oul, to the prai&s;e and adoration of his love. Here was I permitted to dwell as under the pavilion of the goodne&s;s of God, yet not without &s;omething to combat with in my &s;ecret exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>I thus per&s;evered on comfortably for two years after my marriage, when the
<PB N="114" REF="037858_0120_100F88A689F98720">
be&s;t Phy&s;ician, who&s;e penetrating eye &s;aw the malady of my &s;oul, prepared a bitter cup for the purging out a venom that lurked there, which I had &s;ucked in from the malicious adver&s;ary of truth; before, and even after, my going to meeting, and which remained to this time. Hence i&s;&s;ued a fiery trial, by which my profe&s;&s;ions of love and affection were to be proved.</P>
<P>This may well be as a &s;econd part of my hi&s;tory, and is the mo&s;t trying, as it went very near to my &s;piritual, as well as temporal, life. This war was not with fle&s;h and blood, but with the Maje&s;ty on high; under the prince of the power of the air, who rules in the children of di&s;|obedience.</P>
<P>I have before ob&s;erved, that to be an I&s;raelite indeed, had attracted my de&s;ires; but little did I &s;u&s;pect what I had to un|dergo, before my heart was clean&s;ed from
<PB N="115" REF="037858_0121_100F88AA5F66F4A8">
guile, and delivered from that wrath which the enemy had been heaping up in me again&s;t the day of wrath.</P>
<P>To introduce this heavy relation, I mu&s;t go back to my childhood, and &s;ay, that the fir&s;t time I ever heard a woman preach, from a prejudice imbibed from my companions, and, probably, an aver|&s;ion in my own nature, I thought it very ridiculous; and the oftener I had opportu|nities to &s;ee it, the more I &s;ecretly de|&s;pi&s;ed it. At the time that I joined with friends, this was one of my &s;tronge&s;t ob|jections to them; but I endeavoured to &s;ilence it, by concluding, that others might do as they plea&s;ed, and &s;o would I.</P>
<P>My aunt, as I have hinted, gave me many remembrances thereof, as &s;he knew my di&s;like to it, from my former confe&s;&s;ion; and, I have no doubt, the &s;erpent, by means of this prejudice, in|jected his venom the deeper; for &s;ince
<PB N="116" REF="037858_0122_100F88AC09C4F230">
I have found out his workings, I have remembered a &s;ecret fear, which I had at times on this account, and which this cunning enemy had allayed, by reminding me of my many prote&s;ta|tions again&s;t it. The apprehen&s;ion, how|ever, continued, that I &s;hould certainly come to be a preacher; which greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me: the allowance of women's preaching being the only di&s;like I had to the di&s;cipline and order of the church; yet &s;till I &s;atisfied my&s;elf with many in|con&s;iderate re&s;olves again&s;t it.</P>
<P>But here I may remark a good oppor|tunity allotted me for the &s;haking off tho&s;e &s;hackles which the fiend was fa&s;t|ening on me; but which I lo&s;t, and have remembered it many times with &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Being in di&s;cour&s;e with a friend, he frankly a&s;ked me, if I had any &s;cruples? or whether I was &s;atisfied with the prin|ciples of friends? I &s;topt &s;hort in my
<PB N="117" REF="037858_0123_100F88B0D7AF5EA8">
mind apprehending, if I &s;hould men|tion women's preaching, he would think I &s;poke with regard to my&s;elf. Thus was I baffled; and I an&s;wered, that I was &s;atisfied in the principle it&s;elf. At that time my idea of preaching was, that it was an act of love and friend&s;hip, &s;e|parate from obedience; and glad could I have been, like Mo&s;es, if all the Lord's people had been &s;o inclined; women excepted.</P>
<P>I continued thus for &s;ome years, till I became &s;uch a &s;lave to my fears, that I could not &s;ay, "Thy will, O Lord, be done." But like Naaman, the captain of Syria, would fain be excu&s;ed from this thing. I now began to believe that &s;uch expo&s;ures were &s;omething more than voluntary offerings, and was convinced, from many proofs, that my &s;tate had been as clearly &s;poken to by my own &s;ex, as by the other; yet, &s;uch was my perver&s;e|ne&s;s, that, one day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had much ado to

&s;tay the meeting, though I could not help acknowledging within my&s;elf, that it would have been an acceptable te&s;ti|mony, had it came from a man. So great was my prejudice; but greater, yes, may I &s;ay, infinitely greater, were the conde&s;centions of God; for I was &s;till favoured in my waitings with a &s;en&s;e of his living pre&s;ence. The my&s;teries of true divinity were opened to my un|der&s;tanding, and through the influences of divine love has my cup overflowed with &s;uch acknowledgments as the&s;e; "Oh, my beloved! if thou deale&s;t &s;o bountifully with me, my brea&s;t will be too narrow to contain thy love; oh! with|hold thy hand, or I &s;hall certainly &s;peak of thy goodne&s;s to others." And, I really believe, had I embraced that opportunity, and joined with the Lord in his workings on my mind, I &s;hould have been delivered from my fears, and e&s;caped tho&s;e cro&s;s occurrences I have &s;ince waded through: but here my poor &s;oul &s;hrunk from

the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, who&s;e yoke, to the pa&s;&s;ive mind, becomes ea&s;y, and his burden light. Yet &s;uch was my weakne&s;s, that, through &s;hort|&s;ightedne&s;s, and the fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions of the enemy, I &s;tarted a&s;ide; and may truly &s;ay, the longer I carried my bur|den, the heavier it proved; and I now have, with regret, to look back and con|fe&s;s, that in&s;tead of clo&s;ing with the vi|&s;itations of love; I joined with my in|veterate enemy, and re&s;olved not to wait for, or encourage any farther di&s;cove|ries. Thus did I harden my&s;elf, wretched creature that I was; and when I have felt the power of the Almighty moving with love upon my mind, I have no le&s;s than &s;aid; I will have no more under|&s;tanding; and &s;undry times &s;hut mine eyes upon the book that has been, as it were, put into my hand, when the be&s;t of interpreters has been near, and &s;o with&s;tood that tender love which fol|lowed me; and I have ri&s;en from my

chair, to fix my thoughts on other ob|jects.</P>
<P>My &s;oul is really affected with the goodne&s;s of God, in the continuation of his mercies towards me; and under a &s;en&s;e of the horrible &s;tate I was then in, whil&s;t the wor&s;t of enemies had full rule; and He, who &s;hed for me his mo&s;t pre|cious blood, was rejected, at the hazard of the &s;alvation of my &s;oul; &s;itting down far &s;hort of a true I&s;raelite.</P>
<P>Thus went I on, stifling conviction; till I was lulled into a &s;piritual lethargy, where I lay, till the compa&s;&s;ionate God, who wills not the death of a &s;inner, was plea&s;ed to arou&s;e me to a con&s;ideration of what I had been doing; and I found enough to do, to keep from &s;inking under the bitter reflections I had brought upon my&s;elf, by my rebellious proceedings; and yet, through the unutterable goodne&s;s of God, I was again revived by his favours.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="037858_0127_100F88BADF561C28">
Having got a little recovery from this &s;tate of deep affliction, I was vi&s;ited with weakne&s;s of body; &s;o that both my&s;elf and others thought I was nigh unto death; but it plea&s;ed the Lord, in an un|expected hour, to give me this a&s;&s;urance, "Thou &s;halt not die, but live to declare what I have done for thee." This was &s;till &s;o contrary to my de&s;ires, that I could not rejoice at all at the lengthen|ing of my days; for now I did believe I &s;hould certainly be tried. Oh! the days and nights of conflict that followed this intimation. My countenance changed, my health &s;eemed daily impaired; the &s;olitary places were made witne&s;&s;es of my grief; and, as the years increa&s;ed, &s;o did my exerci&s;e, till I had another vi&s;ita|tion of &s;ickne&s;s, and was, to all appear|ance, pa&s;t recovery. Mo&s;t willingly would I have yielded unto death; chu&s;|ing rather to die, than live to be any more di&s;obedient; and it plea&s;ed the Lord to prove me again and again in the &s;ecret of

my &s;oul, whether I would live to be obedient to his requirings, or die; and my choice was, rather to die, than live to be a preacher. Yet it plea&s;ed him in his wi&s;dom to rai&s;e me again, contrary to the expectation of tho&s;e that beheld me; none of whom, at this time knew any thing of the exerci&s;e of my mind, which increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree as can|not well be expre&s;&s;ed. My body would tremble as a thing &s;haken: and my groans were like tho&s;e of a dying man. But now I had learned, by dear experience, to cleave unto the Lord; and when I have felt the power; what, if I &s;ay, of his might; I &s;ought out places mo&s;t proper to receive it, and bowed in pro&s;tration. From the weight whereof I have pa&s;&s;ionately or affectionately bur&s;t forth in this lan|guage, "Lord, what would&s;t thou have me to do?" And as I believed it was a preparation for a further exerci&s;e, I of|ten begged he would be plea&s;ed to make me able to bear whatever he &s;hould think

meet in his wi&s;dom to lay upon me; and, indeed, &s;weet was his love and merciful his dealings, many times renewing his covenant with my &s;oul. Yet here I was not to continue, but led again to the te&s;t of my fidelity.</P>
<P>Being in meeting, in a comfortable frame of &s;pirit, I found a motion in my &s;oul, moving me to wor&s;hip God in vocal prayer; and, although I had known the &s;ame power in my own chamber, and with plea&s;ure &s;ubmitted to it there, yet here not yielding to the impul&s;e, my heart, and all that was within me, became confu&s;ed; the whole fabric was &s;haken; and this was taken notice of by a friend that &s;at behind me, who, as &s;oon as meeting was over, a&s;ked me how I did; &s;aying, &s;he was &s;ure I had been ill. I an&s;wered, I was but indifferent; as well I might. This &s;eemed a good cau|tion to me, as I de&s;ired to keep my ex|erci&s;e to my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="037858_0130_100F88C31EFBF220">
Not many more meetings pa&s;&s;ed before I was tried again; when I fixed my body as firm as I could, but found it impo&s;&s;i|ble to &s;till my mind. I knew too well how it was with me; though the whi&s;perer would per&s;uade me it was all imagination.</P>
<P>In this way did I trifle &s;o long, that the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Almighty &s;eemed hot again&s;t me, and life and death were &s;et before me. I was all in confu&s;ion, both at home and abroad, wi&s;hing my&s;elf any other creature; and here I moiled and turmoiled, till I could bear it no longer; and, at length, concluded it be&s;t to break it to a friend; when he &s;ignified it had been for &s;ome time in the &s;ecret of his thoughts, that &s;omething of that &s;ort lay upon me; and, though I here proved, that it was not in man, by the force of argument and tender advice, to &s;ubject my &s;tubborn will; yet I received &s;ome advantage from it, and acknow|ledged the truth of that advice, which
<PB N="125" REF="037858_0131_100F88C5B6E74470">
I did not clo&s;ely follow, but became in my&s;elf as a piece of contradiction. Some|times I would follow the Lord, and then re&s;olve otherwi&s;e. I went to meet|ings as a &s;lave to his labour. At home, I dur&s;t not &s;it down in &s;olitude, being &s;ure to meet with judgment, and into company I could not go, without wound|ing my&s;elf, by pretending to be what I was not; le&s;t I &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected grave; concluding, every one that looked on me earne&s;tly, knew how it was with me.</P>
<P>Thus was I harra&s;&s;ed, as betwixt the up|per and the nether mill&s;tone, often wi&s;h|ing for death, and that I never had been born: &s;o great was my &s;traight, I could not go back again, becau&s;e I was not able to &s;hake off the principle of truth; and had thoughts of flinging my&s;elf into the jaws of death. Yet, for ever prai&s;ed be the name of the Lord, his mercy withheld the de|vourer, and pre&s;erved me; giving me to &s;ee into his fal&s;e in&s;inuations, and to believe
<PB N="126" REF="037858_0132_100F88C748F5FDB8">
that the life, which was in his power to take at his plea&s;ure, would not be a &s;ufficient atonement for those rebellions I had been guilty of; and I was brought to an ab|horrence of tho&s;e thoughts which I had been made to conceive. And herein did the goodne&s;s of the Lord appear &s;o evident, that I re&s;olved to keep clo&s;e to meetings. But, alas! when there, in|&s;tead of keeping clo&s;e to my exerci&s;e, I, through fear kept my&s;elf from it, and &s;at, as it appeared to me, empty, void, and wa&s;te: empty of tho&s;e de&s;ires I u&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s; void of all that was good&punc; and wa&s;te, as being laid a&s;ide by the Al|mighty; and all through a &s;lavi&s;h fear that I could not draw nigh to God. I &s;at as though I had nothing to do, but to &s;ee with a wi&s;hful eye others partake of that food, which my &s;oul &s;tood in need of; yet my &s;tate was different from tho&s;e who are at ea&s;e in Zion; for when I have looked at tho&s;e who, I thought, were in a right frame of mind, they

&s;eemed to be feeding at the Lord's table, whil&s;t my hungry &s;oul &s;tood in a &s;tate of e&s;trangement from him, without courage enough too &s;eek the &s;cattered crumbs.</P>
<P>Thus it was with me many days; till in one meeting, growing faint, a &s;tate of drow&s;ine&s;s overtook me, a thing which I was not naturally given to; yet &s;o far did it prevail, that I was forced to pinch my&s;elf, to keep awake. Now I thought my&s;elf wor&s;e than ever I was in my life; for, in my childhood, I had the form, which I left to po&s;&s;es the power; yet here I found not &s;o ea&s;y an acce&s;s as I had expected; and though I &s;ought, and &s;ought; in&s;tead of meeting with my true friend, I met with my enemy, dre&s;&s;ed in the doctrine of election and reproba|tion. This I had been led into &s;ome years before, and now had much ado, through the &s;en&s;e of my own unworthi|ne&s;s, to &s;hake it off; labouring hard again&s;t the temptation of de&s;troying my|&s;elf
<PB N="128" REF="037858_0134_100F88CE02AD8818">
and fooli&s;hly wi&s;hing &s;ome accident would do that office. But here the riches of God's grace again appeared. I was brought to &s;ee and acknowledge, that, if my &s;oul peri&s;hed eternally, the Lord was but ju&s;t in his dealings with me; and the&s;e con&s;iderations had &s;ome effect: I de&s;ired to be brought back to my former &s;tate, that I might have acce&s;s to his power, be a witne&s;s of his love, and tried once more. My pen &s;urely would fail, ere I could fully &s;et forth the conde&s;cen|&s;ions and long-&s;ufferings of the goodne&s;s of my Creator towards me. I here knew my pardon &s;ealed; but my peace la&s;ted not long; for I was quickly tried again and again; and &s;till I did not give up. I was &s;en&s;ible that I flinched from that power which was ready as a hand to help me; and therefore wor&s;e and wor&s;e, &s;aid I to my &s;oul. It will never be better with thee, &s;ugge&s;ted the enemy. I knew not which way to turn; I was weary of my own ob&s;tinacy. I would now &s;ee what I

could gain by &s;elf-mortification; and as I could not work, I would eat but little. I &s;tudied &s;everal ways to afflict my&s;elf; and have thought, glad &s;hould I be, if I had no tongue. Here again I had cau&s;e to know the old prompter to be near to augment my di&s;tre&s;s; which, with my own di&s;obedience, made the whole crea|tion appear to be again&s;t me. Oh! I was in &s;uch perplexity, that I &s;aid, Now &s;hall I fall by the hand of my enemy. I fretted, and chafed at my&s;elf, and every thing about me, and could not come at &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>At one time, as I was &s;eriou&s;ly reflect|ing on my &s;ituation, the&s;e thoughts pa&s;&s;ed my mind, and &s;urpri&s;ed me; "if thou be a God of power, make me willing." This was no &s;ooner pa&s;t, but they were followed as quick, in compari&s;on, as lightning, by, "Soul, dete&s;t thou this pre&s;umption; for though he is a God of power, it is in his time he will redeem." I was a&s;toni&s;hed,
<PB N="130" REF="037858_0136_100F88D3113F8318">
and &s;aid, "Lord, what is it?" and it came thus before me, "there is war in heaven, Michael and the Dragon." When the flutter was over, I remembered the pa&s;|&s;age where it is &s;aid; "in the day of my power, my people &s;hall be a willing people;" and I was con&s;olated by it. There al&s;o fell out another &s;ingular oc|currence about this time, which I can|not well omit. I was fully per&s;uaded in my&s;elf, that if I went on in this ob&s;tinacy, my hou&s;e would be laid wa&s;te; and, with|in a month afterwards, we had in the view of many &s;pectators, a wonderful deliver|ance from fire: during which, whil&s;t others were bu&s;y, in con&s;idering how it &s;hould happen, I was as bu&s;y in reflecting on my&s;elf as the cau&s;e; and it weighed me down in humble acknowledgments unto God, for his merciful pre&s;ervation. The world, in a comparative way of &s;peaking, &s;eemed now to be near an end with me; and, as if a total eclip&s;e was drawing on; every &s;cene and object looked gloomy; and

which ever way I turned my eye, an angry God appeared. There was no &s;helter for me; nothing now to defend my&s;elf with, or way of e&s;caping; and na|ture mu&s;t yield. In a little time the trial came again; and, in that moment, the enemy of my &s;oul &s;ugge&s;ted, that if I got up, I &s;hould not be able to &s;tand; but, thanks to the Almighty, I was &s;trength|ened to try, and found him a liar. The expre&s;&s;ion of a few words produced a ble&s;&s;ed change. There &s;eemed now a new heaven and a new earth; old things pa&s;&s;ed away, and all things belonging to my &s;tate, became new; no more guilt for pa&s;t di&s;obedience remained; but new em|braces and new covenants filled up that joyful day. Yet I looked forward with anxiety to another meeting day; and thought I formerly thought meetings did not come fa&s;t enough, yet now they &s;eemed to come too &s;oon. In two or three of them, I &s;at under a degree of &s;lavi&s;h fear; yet truly de&s;ired to keep my

integrity and obedience. At length, a &s;econd trial came; I was moved to kneel down, and, while I viewed the place, my &s;oul &s;ecretly breathed thus before the Lord, "Here is the place of my execu|tion;" and &s;eeing the bo&s;s, "This is the block whereon I mu&s;t yield up the pride of nature, for a te&s;timony of my obedi|ence; remember me, oh Lord! and the conflicts that I undergo to &s;erve thee. Accept, O Lord, the &s;acrifice." I then kneeled down; and when I aro&s;e, this came into my mind; "the life that I mu&s;t now live, mu&s;t be by faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>Thus per&s;evered I in obedience, which wrought un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction, and brought my &s;oul, by degrees, out of the place of thraldom and bondage; and thus, by the goodne&s;s of God, were the &s;trong holds of &s;in and &s;atan brought down, and the joy of my &s;alvation re|&s;tored. Meeting-times and days were plea&s;ant again, whil&s;t my &s;oul wor&s;hipped

the living God, as in the hou&s;e of prayer; and whil&s;t I &s;tand as on the bank of deli|verance, re&s;ounding ho&s;anna in the high|e&s;t; having the harp of thank&s;giving put into my hands, my &s;ong &s;hall be of mer|cies and of judgments, through which my &s;oul has been &s;o far redeemed; and of the victory of the Lamb; by who&s;e right hand and everla&s;ting arm, my &s;oul's enemies have been driven back, &s;cattered, and put to flight.</P>
<P>Now, what have I to render to my God for this mo&s;t glorious work, the &s;alvation of my &s;oul, but the humble ac|knowledgments of the mo&s;t unworthy and vile&s;t of &s;inners: who, by his mo&s;t gracious conde&s;cendings, is enabled and encouraged to a&s;cribe honour, adoration, dominion and renown, with prai&s;es and thank&s;giving, as due to his eternal love, for ever more.</P>
