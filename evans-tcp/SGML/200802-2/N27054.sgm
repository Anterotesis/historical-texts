<Q>&mdash;:BUT ONE SINNER DESTROYETH MUCH GOOD.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE tendency of our holy religion to promote or|der, good government, and &s;ocial happine&s;s is indi&s;putable. To invalidate this proof of the divini|ty of the &s;criptures, we find the infidel pleading, that this excellent &s;y&s;tem of doctrines was doubtle&s;s the contrivance of &s;ome crafty politician to re&s;train, the otherwi&s;e ungovernable pa&s;&s;ions of the human heart. Let him enjoy his argument&mdash;&s;till will we glory in a Revelation, which, while it opens the way to immor|tal bli&s;s, affords the mo&s;t important maxims of wi&s;|dom to direct our pre&s;ent conduct, and the mo&s;t ef|fectual re&s;traints for the corrupt propen&s;ities of hu|man nature. In his word, no le&s;s than by his pro|vidence, is Jehovah plea&s;ed to expre&s;s a parental care for our happine&s;s in this world. There we are taught the important le&s;&s;ons of indu&s;try, economy, and pru|dence, and warned again&s;t tho&s;e ruinous paths to which youth and inexperience, as well as a wrong temper often expo&s;e us. The &s;acred volume is indeed a &s;tranger to that machivalian policy, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to promote the purpo&s;es of a lawle&s;s ambition; but in every &s;phere in which we can be called to act, he who wi&s;hes to unite dignity and u&s;efulne&s;s, with a good con|&s;cience, may find in the &s;criptures a light to his feet, and a lamp to his paths. Copying after the model there pre&s;cribed, he will ever act honorably, he will compel re&s;pect, he cannot fail to be u&s;eful. Infinite

wi&s;dom made u&s;e of the ob&s;erving and penetrating genius of Solomon to communicate tho&s;e ethical and political remarks, which more immediately relate to the economy of human life, and which &s;o much a|bound in his writings.&mdash;Among the&s;e, the aphori&s;m in the text leads to &s;everal ob&s;ervations not entirely foreign to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.&mdash;The object of the following di&s;cour&s;e will be&mdash;</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate the general ob&s;ervation in the text, that one &s;inner de&s;troys much good.</P>
<P>AND, to attempt an an&s;wer to this que&s;tion, which the &s;ubject naturally &s;ugge&s;ts, viz. whence wicked men derive their ability of de&s;troying good, or doing mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>AGREEABLY to the propo&s;ed method let us</P>
<P>FIRST attend to the illu&s;tration of this truth, that one &s;inner de&s;troys much good.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable that no particular kind of good is here &s;pecified. We are left to apply the ob&s;ervation to every &s;pecies of good which creatures can enjoy, and &s;till it will be found a truth that one &s;inner de|&s;troys much good.&mdash;Sin is mi&s;ery.&mdash;It is the bane of every thing which de&s;erves the appellation of good; and bla&s;ts every ble&s;&s;ing, which the kind parent of the univer&s;e be&s;tows upon his creatures.&mdash;It has expelled the morning &s;tars of glory from their original heaven, and bani&s;hed man from his primeval paradi&s;e. Of all the multiplied &s;orrows attendant on human life, &s;in is the fruitful &s;ource.&mdash;The celebrated Milton did not exhibit the creature of a poetical fancy, but a &s;olemn truth, when he repre&s;ented &s;in bringing forth death. But however general the ob&s;ervation, the in&s;pired writer doubtle&s;s had &s;ome particular kind of good more &s;pecially in view; and which, from the connec|tion, appears to be political or national good.&mdash;The text &s;tands in connection with this &s;entence, "wi&s;dom is better than weapons of war;" that is, wi&s;e and pru|dent mea&s;ures often &s;ecure to a nation &s;peedily, and honorably, without danger, and without expence, tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings and privileges, which ra&s;h and fooli&s;h men plunge into all the horrors of war to obtain. A truth happily illu&s;trated, I conceive, by the conduct of our
<PB N="7" REF="036049_0005_10080BEF3089ACA8">
Federal Government under the cruel injuries, and com|mercial depredations, both of England and France, wi&s;dom is better than weapons of war; this ob&s;erva|tion is immediately followed by the text; but one &s;inner de&s;troyeth much good;&mdash;When in &s;uch na|tional embarra&s;&s;ments the voice of wi&s;dom is di&s;re|garded, and &s;ome ra&s;h coun&s;ellor prevails to hurry a nation into arms, we then have a glaring conviction of this truth, that one &s;inner de&s;troyeth much good. Glory to him who &s;till affords America his divine guidance and protection, that he has pre&s;erved us from following &s;uch pernicious coun&s;els; by many &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly advocated.</P>
<P>But granting that the in&s;pired writer had a more particular reference to political good, which it appears he had, &s;till, the unlimited nature of the expre&s;&s;ion was doubtle&s;s de&s;igned to teach us, that &s;in is de&s;truc|tive of every good.</P>
<P>OF this truth, the proofs are &s;o numerous, that the only ta&s;k is to &s;elect tho&s;e which are calculated to im|pre&s;s the mind with the deepe&s;t conviction.&mdash;Every page in the hi&s;tory of man is a comment on the text, and the experience of every day affords a new confir|mation of its truth.</P>
<P>WHAT ruin does the &s;inner bring upon him&s;elf? "He who doeth this de&s;troyeth his own &s;oul, is the lan|guage of in&s;piration." Such is the nature and faculties of the human &s;oul, its va&s;t &s;u&s;ceptibility both of plea&s;ure and &s;uffering, its amazing activity, and growing capa|cities, its high de&s;tination, and endle&s;s exi&s;tence, that its importance exceeds all calculation.&mdash;The enjoy|ment, or the &s;ufferings of a kingdom, and indeed of the whole human race, as it re&s;pects the pre&s;ent life, cannot be compared with what each individual &s;oul in the whole duration of its exi&s;tence, will either en|joy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Supreme Good, or &s;uffer un|der the tokens of his di&s;plea&s;ure. He who rebels a|gain&s;t his maker&mdash;hardens his heart in impenitency, and rejects the offers of reconciliation and peace, de&s;|troys his own &s;oul, and with it, all that good which he is capacitated to receive in the enjoyment of his Maker. The mind under the influence of a wicked

temper is no le&s;s incapacitated for happine&s;s, than the blind of enjoying the plea&s;ures of &s;ight; or the deaf of receiving entertainment from the harmony of &s;ounds.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e con&s;iderations, &s;ub&s;tantiated as they are by the declarations of eternal truth, are no proofs of the point in the view of the unbeliever.&mdash;He regards them as the dreams of enthu&s;ia&s;m, and demands evi|dence of which he can feel the force.&mdash;Such evidence there is in a melancholy abundance as will convince him, if he is not as de&s;titute of rea&s;on as he is of faith.</P>
<P>WHEN we &s;ee the &s;lave of avarice, or ambition, de&s;|troying the comfort of life to hoard u&s;ele&s;s wealth, and acquire an empty name; or the prodigal, wa&s;ting his goods and de&s;troying his health in riotous living. When we look into families where boi&s;terous pa&s;&s;ion reigns, and drives far away peace and dome&s;tic com|fort&mdash;or into families where the vicious cour&s;es of a parent has introduced poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, and entail|ed di&s;ea&s;es on his po&s;terity, how naturally do &s;uch &s;cenes evidence the propriety of the wi&s;e man's ob|&s;ervation, that one &s;inner, &amp;c.&mdash;Whence flow the tears of the weeping penitent but from a reflection on the far greater good he might have enjoyed him&s;elf, and been in&s;trumental of to others, had he not harkened to the allurements of folly? and oft at the gloomy clo&s;e of a guilty life has the &s;inner him&s;elf been compelled, by the torturing reflections of his own mind to ac|knowledge, that the ways of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors are hard. As we rai&s;e our views to the higher &s;cenes of life, we find, as men became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of power, or are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for their abilities, their capacities for doing mi&s;chief are proportionably increa&s;ed. How often do we find the heavy calamities which fell an antient I&s;|rael attributed to the corrupting influence of Jero|boam and Ahab? When we trace the victories of an Alexander, and the ambition of a Cae&s;ar, or take a view of the more modern lives of Louis XIV, or the cele|brated Pru&s;&s;ian Frederick, we find the groans of en|&s;laved millions, of depopulated kingdoms, and nations bleeding at a thou&s;and wounds atte&s;ting the truth of the

text, and witne&s;&s;ing the calamities which a lawle&s;s am|bition po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s on the human race. What &s;eeds of mi&s;e|ry did Mahomet bring from his cell, when he came forth a pretended prophet of the Mo&s;t High, to propa|gate by fire and &s;word his fabulous revelation? Of what incalculable mi&s;chiefs was Loyola the author when he invented the celebrated order of the Je&s;uits, which, for &s;o many years were the di&s;turbers of the peace, and corruptors of the morals of mankind? And judging from what has already taken place, may we not predict &s;till greater evils from the je&s;uitical author of the pre&s;ent exi&s;ting order of the Illuminati.&mdash;An order profe&s;&s;edly founded on Athei&s;m, at war with every religious principle and moral &s;entiment, and with every Government which refu&s;es &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to its influence. But it is needle&s;s to recur to par|ticular in&s;tances, which might be multiplied with|out number. What is the hi&s;tory of mankind but pages of mourning, of lamentation and woe; &s;cenes of tyranny, oppre&s;&s;ion, carnage and de&s;truction, the na|tural fruit of the unre&s;trained lu&s;ts of the human heart?</P>
<P>IT may be proper however to ob&s;erve here, that no le&s;s de&s;tructive is the poi&s;on which ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> flowed from the pens of tho&s;e who have endeavored by their publi|cations to promote vice and irreligion. The writings of a Shaft&s;bury, a Volney, a Voltaire, a Che&s;terfield, and a Paine, among many others, will be con&s;idered as proofs of this truth by all who believe that virtue and piety are the ba&s;is of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>IT will al&s;o doubtle&s;s be expected, that &s;o convincing an in&s;tance of the pernicious tendency of corrupt prin|ciples and practices as the French nation has exhibited in their late revolution, will not be pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilence. This in&s;tance is indeed perfectly in point; but the &s;peaker mu&s;t beg leave to refer the application of it to your private reflections; as time, and abilities would both fail him in the attempt to de&s;cribe &s;uch &s;urpa&s;|&s;ing &s;cenes of horror. Scenes, in which every princi|ple both of natural and revealed religion, every moral &s;entiment, and dictate of humanity have been pro&s;tra|ted in the du&s;t; and in which every effort of that wi&s;|dom

which the Apo&s;tle characterizes as earthly, &s;en&s;ual, and devili&s;h has been exerted to obtain univer&s;al do|mination, and to rivet heavier chains on tho&s;e whom &s;he had lulled into &s;ecurity with promi&s;es of freedom. Happy will be America, if the injuries which we have received, do but teach us to avoid her crimes, to e&s;cape her de&s;tructive policy, and to cheri&s;h tho&s;e vir|tuous &s;entiments, the annihilation of which in France, has rendered her wretched in her&s;elf, and a &s;courge to mankind. But &s;ome may a&s;k with &s;urprize, can France, &s;urrounded with a train of victories; be wretched! Yes, if the dete&s;tation of the good and virtuous part of mankind, if a mo&s;t unju&s;t and tyran|nical government, if religious per&s;ecution, a ruined commerce, and exhau&s;ted finances, if a boundle&s;s ambition, if robbery and inju&s;tice in their blacke&s;t forms, or the blood of innocent millions crying for vengeance, if the&s;e things can make a nation wretch|ed, then is France wretched&mdash;and if we draw ju&s;t con|clu&s;ions from the &s;acred volume, what &s;he has already &s;uffered will be but the beginning of &s;orrows.</P>
<P>AND wretched every nation mu&s;t be where &s;imilar principles prevail. With as much rea&s;on may it be a&s;&s;erted, that poi&s;on may be taken without danger, and that fevers and con&s;umptions have no tendency to effect the di&s;&s;olution of the body, as, that the pre|valence of wickedne&s;s is not de&s;tructive to the body politic.&mdash;Indeed the mo&s;t mortal di&s;ea&s;es may be lin|gering, and poi&s;on may not produce immediate death; &s;o tho&s;e corruptions which &s;ap the foundations of na|tional exi&s;tence may be gradual in their operation&mdash;internal &s;trength or weakne&s;s of con&s;titution, and many foreign con&s;iderations, may either retard or ac|celerate the final cata&s;trophe, and the able&s;t State phy|&s;icians may be di&s;appointed in progno&s;ticating the par|ticular period of its di&s;&s;olution; but, that national wickedne&s;s tends to, and per&s;i&s;ted in will produce na|tional ruin, is as &s;ure as the truth of hi&s;tory, as the truth of revelation.</P>
<P>THE tendency of national wickedne&s;s to the de|&s;truction of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> good, may be inferred&mdash;from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> tendency of things&mdash;and from
<PB N="11" REF="036049_0009_10080BF790AA28B8">
the moral perfections of the Supreme Governor, as exhibited in his word.</P>
<P>FIRST, this event re&s;ults from the natural con&s;titu|tion, and tendency of things&mdash;the progre&s;s of wick|edne&s;s, and its connection with the ruin of the peo|ple among whom it prevails, may be ea&s;ily traced. We find, that in proportion as the principles of reli|gion and morality are weakened, tho&s;e lu&s;ts and pa&s;|&s;ions, which are &s;o prevalent in the human heart come into operation. Vice begins to lay a&s;ide her ma&s;k, and come forward with open face. The humble do|me&s;tic virtues are de&s;pi&s;ed, and plainne&s;s and &s;implicity of manners become the objects of ridicule. In con&s;e|quence of this depraved ta&s;te the youthful mind is &s;uf|fered to grow up, unformed by in&s;truction, unre&s;train|ed by di&s;cipline; or in&s;tructed only to aim at frivo|lous and &s;howy accompli&s;hments. A generation ri&s;es up which "fears not GOD, nor regards man; &s;elf willed are they, and not afraid to &s;peak evil of digni|ties." The &s;ocial feelings give place to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, envy, and emulation; an emulation to excel, not in &s;ub|&s;tantial virtues, but in titles, in wealth, and &s;plendid appearance. Every thing now yields to a rage for &s;how and parade; and hone&s;t indu&s;try fails to &s;upply the wa&s;te of prodigality. The next con&s;equence is, that public taxes, however rea&s;onable or nece&s;&s;ary, become a ground of complaint, and every expence, which is not devoted to luxury is &s;ubmitted to with reluctance. Extortion, oppre&s;&s;ion, and all the tricks of fraud and knavi&s;h &s;peculation are re&s;orted to, for a &s;upply to the demands of extravagance. Bribery and corruption are of cour&s;e introduced&mdash;ju&s;tice becomes venal&mdash;the mo&s;t important intere&s;ts of the public, are compeled to give way to private and &s;elfi&s;h views&mdash;and pretended patriots become as numerous, as real ones are rare; that is, per&s;ons who are &s;eeking public favor and emol|ument, under the covert of a pretended zeal for the public good. This is the proper cri&s;is for ambitious men to promote parties and factions, to mi&s;lead the unwary multitude, and to turn the tide of public o|dium again&s;t tho&s;e virtuous few, who are the re|maining props of a &s;inking State. And this is the
<PB N="12" REF="036049_0010_10080BFAACD4FD60">
time for any foreign enemy, by the &s;ecret influence of bribery, by &s;upporting internal enemies, and di|viding and di&s;tracting the Coun&s;els of a nation, to effect that, which the mo&s;t powerful armaments, in a virtuous &s;tate of &s;ociety would have attempted in vain. This is the progre&s;s, and evident tendency of vice; and by this progre&s;s it has overturned Empires and States deemed unconquerable. The efforts by which the &s;mall republics of Athens and Sparta with|&s;tood, and finally defeated, the almo&s;t incredible arma|ments of Darius and Xerxes, are in&s;tances never to be forgotten, of the irre&s;i&s;table force which republican virtues give to a nation. And the &s;equel of the Gre|cian hi&s;tory affords an equally memorable proof of the fatal effects of a prevailing thir&s;t for gold, and the enfeebling influence of luxury and di&s;&s;ipated manners. The Per&s;ians had long found them invincible in arms, they at length applied their gold and &s;ilver to obtain parti&s;ans, and promote divi&s;ions among them. By the&s;e weapons they &s;ucceeded. The heroic virtues di&s;|played at Marathon, and the &s;traits of Thermopyloe, were found no more in Greece. Their Councils be|came divided, every mea&s;ure of defence was weaken|ed, if not entirely defeated, and tho&s;e arms, which had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully employed again&s;t their enemies, were turned upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>As a further evidence of the tendency of &s;inful practices to de&s;troy national good; we may a&s;k, why is not America quiet and happy? In the enjoyment of every priviledge and ble&s;&s;ing which any human government can be&s;tow, &s;urrounded with the rich bounties of an indulgent providence, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing re&s;ources, which, properly applied, would leave us nothing to fear from the united powers of Europe, yet why, in &s;uch circum&s;tances of &s;ecurity, are we filled with continual alarms? Why are men of the mo&s;t approved wi&s;dom and fidelity, men who have been firm to their country's cau&s;e in her mo&s;t trying &s;cenes, and whom we have ju&s;tly acknowledged as our political &s;aviours, yet, why are the&s;e men, without the lea&s;t apparent cau&s;e, held up as objects of &s;u&s;picion; and every art u&s;ed to fill the minds of the citizens
<PB N="13" REF="036049_0011_10080BFC3477F608">
with groundle&s;s jealou&s;ies? Why is every mea&s;ure of our Federal Government, though evidently marked with wi&s;dom, and e&s;pecially every mea&s;ure calculated for our defence, the object of cen&s;ure? Why in par|ticular cannot a dangerous alien be required to depart, nor a &s;editious citizen puni&s;hed, who has been convict|ed of having invented and propagated known fal&s;hoods, with a de&s;ign to injure the government, and rai&s;e a prejudice again&s;t its officers, but immediately a cry of uncon&s;titutional oppre&s;&s;ion is &s;ounded through the U|nion? And &s;till more to a&s;toni&s;h us, we find tho&s;e very per&s;ons who have &s;uch a refined &s;en&s;e of the liberties of the &s;ubject, and &s;uch a jealous concern for the freedom of mankind, approving in the gro&s;s all the mea&s;ures of the French Government&mdash;even of that mo&s;t arbitrary act of oppre&s;&s;ion which drove her worthie&s;t, and mo&s;t honorable citizens into bani&s;hment, without the form of a trial&mdash;and of that, which compels every citizen to open his doors to cu&s;tomers on the chri&s;tian Sab|bath, however di&s;po&s;ed he may be to &s;pend the &s;acred hours in devotion. And why, we may further a&s;k, are the greate&s;t exertions of the yet firm friends of America, nece&s;&s;ary to prevent her from flying, like a fa&s;cinated bird, into the ravenous maw of that mon&s;ter, which has already devoured &s;o many nations, whom &s;he had fir&s;t deceived with her wiles?&mdash;The&s;e are que&s;tions which any one can an&s;wer; and they lead to the &s;entiment expre&s;&s;ed in the text, that one &s;inner de&s;troyeth much good.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, from the moral perfections of the Su|preme Ruler, as exhibited in his word, no le&s;s than from the evident tendency of things, we are a&s;&s;ured, that national iniquities are connected with national ruin, and therefore, that he who is in&s;trumental in corrupt|ing the morals of a nation, is a &s;inner who de&s;troys much good. As &s;ocieties do not exi&s;t, as &s;uch, in a future &s;tate, it &s;eems rea&s;onable in this view to expect, that God in his righteous providence will reward, or puni&s;h nations here with a degree of exactne&s;s, which, we are not to expect will take place with re&s;pect to in|dividuals, in this pre&s;ent life. This idea is fully con|firmed by the account the &s;acred hi&s;tory has tran&s;mit|ted
<PB N="14" REF="036049_0012_10080BFFB43F61A8">
to us of the divine di&s;pen&s;ations towards the Jews, and other nations. Even the cho&s;en people of God, could not obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the promi&s;ed land, until the inhabitants had filled the mea&s;ure of their iniqui|ties; but when in the judgment of infinite wi&s;dom, it became nece&s;&s;ary to make them a public example, in vain they looked for &s;afety to their chariots of iron, or their cities walled to heaven. The &s;ame divine impartiality, and moral rectitude appears in his con|duct towards his favored I&s;rael; when they forgot his benefits, and for&s;ook their GOD, they fell an ea&s;y prey to every invader, but when by unfeigned repen|tance they &s;ought his favor, again they were ble&s;&s;ed with his indulgent &s;miles. But it is needle&s;s to mul|tiply particular in&s;tances, for Jehovah has publi&s;hed the following as the fixed univer&s;al rule of his govern|ment, that "when I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it, if it &s;hall do evil in my &s;ight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I &s;aid I would benefit them." From this principle, that nation|al guilt is connected with national mi&s;ery, the infer|ence is plain, that the &s;inner is virtually the enemy of his country, and a de&s;troyer of its good. In this view we find both Achan, and Ahab denounced, the trou|blers of I&s;rael. The &s;inner is eminently a troubler of I&s;rael when he is a per&s;on in authority, and entru&s;ted with the important intere&s;ts of a people. The wi&s;e advice of Jethro to Mo&s;es was, to &s;elect for his copart|ners in government, not only able men, but &s;uch as feared GOD, men of truth, and hating covetou&s;ne&s;s; &s;uch only will prove truly ble&s;&s;ings to their country. One of the important advantages re&s;ulting from the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory is, the &s;triking view it gives of the dangerous con&s;equences of entru&s;ting men with power, who are de&s;titute of any fixed principle of morality and religion. As far as a regard to intere&s;t and repu|tation will &s;timulate, we may expect a degree of fidel|ity; but in tho&s;e critical and trying periods, when, to be faithful to his tru&s;t, would probably deprive him of an honorable po&s;t, injure his worldy intere&s;t, or draw upon him the odium of the public, what, in
<PB N="15" REF="036049_0013_10080C02271AA690">
&s;uch circum&s;tances, can induce a magi&s;trate, who fears not GOD, has no re&s;pect to the rights of con&s;cience, nor feels the powers of the world to come, to be faith|ful to his country's cau&s;e? And be&s;ides, the examples of unprincipled men will be more or le&s;s contamina|ting. Their immoral feelings, and their contempt of tho&s;e in&s;titutions, which are the great &s;upports of re|ligion, will unavoidably influence their conduct; and we need not be told how powerfully the examples of exalted characters, and e&s;pecially their bad examples operate on the public mind.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps the &s;inner will con&s;ider the text as compliment to his abilities, and be plea&s;ed with the idea, that he is capable of de&s;troying &s;o much good: for mo&s;t men con&s;ider great capacities as more hono|rary than a good heart; and do mi&s;chief, merely to rai&s;e them&s;elves into con&s;equence; as he who burned the temple of Diana to perpetuate his name.&mdash;Whe|ther a capacity to do mi&s;chief is &s;o honorable as &s;ome imagine, will appear in the con&s;ideration of a que&s;|tion which ari&s;es from the &s;ubject, and to which the propo&s;ed method leads us,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, to attend, viz. Whence &s;inners derive their ability of de&s;troying good. The &s;ucce&s;s of the evil doer is no evidence of his abilities; but re&s;ults from the excellent nature of good&mdash;and the various means and in&s;truments of mi&s;chief which this imper|fect &s;tate affords.</P>
<P>FIRST. The excellent nature of good, and the delicacy of its con&s;titution renders it very liable to in|jury.&mdash;All good depends on the exi&s;tence of certain proportions, and exact relations, and which mu&s;t be kept compleat, or the good they produce is at an end. To de&s;troy good is but to derange that order, or al|ter that nice proportion; to &s;top a wheel, or to draw a pin.&mdash;What a trifling cau&s;e may di&s;order that ama|zing di&s;play of wi&s;dom, the human frame.&mdash;A &s;park, which a child may communicate, may de&s;troy what the mo&s;t ingenious arti&s;ts have been years in erecting. And we are not in&s;en&s;ible what di&s;turbances, very contemptible agents have been able to produce both in this, and other nations.&mdash;Hence, to do good, is in|finitely
<PB N="16" REF="036049_0014_10080C046BD03790">
more excellent, and requires un&s;peakably grea|ter abilities than to do mi&s;chief. Good, can re&s;ult only from proportionate power, wi&s;dom, and bene|volence; but ignorance, or malice, with a &s;mall de|gree of power, may de&s;troy much good.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. It is further ob&s;ervable, that in this imperfect &s;tate the means of doing good are few, and the difficulties to be overcome are great, whereas, the ignorance, the weakne&s;s, and wickedne&s;s of mankind, afford innumerable ready in&s;truments to the workers of iniquity&mdash;The way of doing good, like the way of &s;alvation is &s;trait and narrow.&mdash;Much patience, forti|tude, and per&s;everance are nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;We mu&s;t ex|pect to encounter the prejudices, the pa&s;&s;ions, and ig|norance of mankind&mdash;we &s;hall find but few to a&s;&s;i&s;t, but many to oppo&s;e and counteract us.</P>
<P>But he who is &s;et on doing mi&s;chief has both wind and tide. No &s;cruples u&s;ually re&s;train &s;uch men from u&s;ing any means which will be&s;t promote their de|&s;igns. Fal&s;hood, and all the ba&s;e arts of deception are their common weapons. The evil doer will em|brace you as a friend that he may better direct the fatal dagger to your heart, and appear as an Angel of Light, to give the &s;urer &s;ucce&s;s to his infernal purpo|&s;es. In&s;truments of mi&s;chief are ea&s;ily found. The prejudices, the lu&s;ts, and pa&s;&s;ions of men, all which &s;trongly oppo&s;e him who wi&s;hes to promote any good de&s;ign, lend their willing aid to the workers of ini|quity. For in&s;tance, is the &s;inner aiming to bla&s;t the reputation of his neighbor? He can &s;carce invent any thing &s;o ab&s;urd, or notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e, but he will find many eager to hear, and as eager to propagate, and to give credibility to the &s;candal. Or is he di&s;|po&s;ed to foment divi&s;ions in Church or State? In one he meets with a re&s;tle&s;s factious &s;pirit, who&s;e &s;oul is an enemy to peace.&mdash;In another he finds a man of a ruined fortune who pants for revolutions, and public di&s;turbances, in which he can lo&s;e nothing, but may gain much. A third, according to his wi&s;hes, is alrea|dy looking up with a mixture of envy and ambition, to tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;tations of dignity, of which his vanity tells him he alone is worthy. And a large
<PB N="17" REF="036049_0015_10080C064224D7E8">
multitude, who, through want of information lie open to all the arts of deception. The&s;e, and many &s;imilar characters, which exi&s;t in every &s;ociety, are the ready in&s;truments of the evil doer, and willingly join their forces to promote his pernicious de&s;igns. Therefore, that wicked men of weak capacities are capable of doing much mi&s;chief, is no ju&s;t ground of exultation to them, nor of &s;urpri&s;e to others.</P>
<P>THIS view is calculated to excite caution in tho&s;e who wi&s;h to counteract their devices.</P>
<P>THE works of evil-doers are works of darkne&s;s. They often obtain their ends by arts too &s;ecret to be &s;een, and too abominable to be &s;u&s;pected.&mdash;Hence, good men have oftener been foiled by the arts, than by the arms of their enemies. Inexperienced them|&s;elves in fraud, it is not ea&s;y for them to believe, what they are often compeled, when too late, to acknow|ledge for truth.</P>
<P>THE virtuous Swi&s;s could not believe that the French Government had no regard to treaties; nor could the King of Naples credit the idea, that the offi|cers of his army were in the pay of the Directory. And who in America could have credited a few years pa&s;t, what is now abundantly &s;ub&s;tantiated, that, while France apparently e&s;pou&s;ed our intere&s;ts with &s;o much warmth, its real objects were, not &s;imply the humiliation of her hated rival, but to reduce A|merica it&s;elf to a &s;tate of dependance, more abject than that from which &s;he pretended to rai&s;e it. That, their utmo&s;t policy was exerted to exhau&s;t all our re|&s;ources by continuing the war; or otherwi&s;e to have &s;ubjected us to terms of peace far more di&s;advanta|geous, than our profe&s;&s;ed enemies them&s;elves would have impo&s;ed. Such arts are u&s;ual weapons of evil|doers, and again&s;t the&s;e weapons a wakeful caution is a nece&s;&s;ary &s;hield. It is far from the object of the&s;e remarks to introduce a &s;pirit of jealou&s;y into &s;ociety; a &s;pirit productive of none of tho&s;e advantages &s;ome attribute to it, but generating endle&s;s tumults and di&s;orders, feuds and in&s;urrections. There is how|ever another extreme, a &s;upine negligence, an incre|dulous confidence, which is at no time a real virtue,
<PB N="18" REF="036049_0016_10080C0952913068">
and is often found a dangerous weakne&s;s. To &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e who merit our confidence, is hateful jealou&s;y; to repo&s;e confidence in one who has evidenced a di&s;|po&s;ition to betray and injure us, is certainly a weak|ne&s;s. The countenance given to tho&s;e who&s;e princi|ples and practi&s;es are notoriou&s;ly unfriendly to the in|tere&s;ts of America, and the backwardne&s;s of many to contribute to the nece&s;&s;ary means of defence, even while they acknowledge the danger which threatens their country, indicate, that we need to be more deep|ly impre&s;&s;ed with the dangers which &s;urround us, and more attentive to this truth, that one &s;inner may de|&s;troy much good.</P>
<P>THE addre&s;&s;es, which the occa&s;ion dictates, will now clo&s;e the &s;ubject.&mdash;In the fir&s;t place, I would beg leave to addre&s;s my&s;elf to your Excellency, whom the free, and general &s;uffrages of your fellow-citizens, have a|gain called to the fir&s;t office in the State. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;entiments of &s;incere e&s;teem for your per&s;onal virtues, with a grateful &s;en&s;e of the important &s;ervices you have already rendered your country, and venera|ting your official character as the mini&s;ter of high heaven, and the repre&s;entative of the Supreme Ruler, I cannot in this addre&s;s be guilty of intentional rude|ne&s;s; but ill &s;hould I di&s;charge the duties of this day, were I to &s;ub&s;titute flattering titles, for tho&s;e &s;o|lemn truths, the occa&s;ion is calculated to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>YOU will, therefore, permit me &s;ir, to remark, that proportionate to the dignities, are the duties of your exalted &s;tation. Power, and authority are perverted talents, when they are not exerci&s;ed in doing good. In the expre&s;&s;ive language of the poet.</P>
<LG>
<L>" <HI>Heaven's favors here are trials, not rewards;</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>A call to duty, not relea&s;e from care."</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>O SIR, you will not forget that He who has ap|pointed us our re&s;pective &s;tations, and has furni&s;hed us with capacities and opportunities for doing good, ob&s;erves our conduct; that at his impartial tribunal we mu&s;t render our final account, and receive accor|ding to our works. You will not be unmindful of the &s;olemn tru&s;t with which you are inve&s;ted; while the mo&s;t important concerns of your county, the in|tere&s;ts
<PB N="19" REF="036049_0017_10080C0C5EAD4D50">
of religion, and all that is dear to man are com|mitted to your care, in connection with the other guardians of the State, and at a period &s;o intere&s;ting as the pre&s;ent, when the powers of darkne&s;s are ex|erting all their &s;ubtilty to involve this happy coun|try, this a&s;ylum of religion and liberty, in ruin; and when the danger is &s;o much increa&s;ed by the unhap|py prevalence of a jealous di&s;organizing &s;pirit, which has infected not individuals only, but too vi&s;ibly ap|pears in our public councils. To do good is as labo|rious, as it is ea&s;y to de&s;troy it. Weighty are the cares of Government when their importance is felt. No &s;mall degree of &s;elf denial is nece&s;&s;ary to encounter the prejudices and pa&s;&s;ions of mankind. But how ani|mating the reflection, that our Glorious Ma&s;ter be|holds with an eye of approbation the trials and conflicts of tho&s;e, who are faithfully endeavoring to do good, and that his rich rewards are the ble&s;&s;ings of an ap|proving con&s;cience, and crowns of immortal bli&s;s. Animated and &s;upported by the&s;e views, &s;till may it be your Excellency's highe&s;t honor to do good. As a benefactor of your country, may you long live in the grateful feelings of Americans; and at &s;ome far di&s;tant period, po&s;&s;e&s;s the more &s;ub&s;tantial rewards which a|wait the friends and benefactors of mankind.</P>
<P>To the honorable Council, the honorable Senate, and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, would I al&s;o beg leave to pre&s;ent re&s;pectful addre&s;&s;es, and cordial congratula|tions on this plea&s;ing occa&s;ion. To promote the grow|ing greatne&s;s of your happy country, to lead her in the paths of peace, to protect her important rights, and counteract the devices of her enemies, is the arduous, but honorable ta&s;k to which you, our political fathers are now called. If the ob&s;ervations which have been made are productive of the effects mo&s;t earne&s;tly de|&s;ired by the &s;peaker, you will enter on tho&s;e important &s;ervices with minds penetrated with the&s;e &s;entiments&mdash;that &s;in is mi&s;ery&mdash;that religion is the &s;ource, and &s;e|curity of all human ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;and that laws are but weak re&s;traints, where the fear of GOD, and the moral &s;en&s;e of right and duty have cea&s;ed to exi&s;t. Under this view you will labor by your private influence and
<PB N="20" REF="036049_0018_10080C0DE52D74C0">
example, no le&s;s than by your official tran&s;actions to encourage virtue, and to di&s;countenance vice and im|morality.</P>
<P>MORE effectually to counteract the devices of evil doers, the importance of united Councils is obvious. The pre&s;ent, is one of tho&s;e intere&s;ting periods, when a &s;en&s;e of common danger tends to draw to a clo&s;er union the real friends of their country. May the&s;e &s;entiments be fervently cheri&s;hed, and all local preju|dices, and party views be made to yield to the com|mon intere&s;t.</P>
<P>RELIGION has become, if po&s;&s;ible, of increa&s;ed im|portance to Americans, in con&s;equence of an uncom|mon connection between our political and religious intere&s;ts. Our enemies are evidently &s;eeking the de&s;truction of our civil priviledges, by undermining their &s;ure&s;t defence, our religious and moral &s;y&s;tems. This fortre&s;s taken, we fall their prey without re&s;i&s;t|ance. To advance the intere&s;ts o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> religion and virtue, and as a direct means thereto, to promote u&s;eful know|ledge, and moral in&s;truction, we flatter our&s;elves will be a leading object in your deliberations.</P>
<P>ON the preparations for this occa&s;ion, it has been my fixed purpo&s;e, to avoid the arrogance of appearing to dictate to the &s;uperior wi&s;dom of this venerable body, the political mea&s;ures proper to be pur&s;ued. I cannot however, leave this place, with a mind free from guilt, &s;hould I neglect to beg your attention to the exi&s;ting act of this State for the ob&s;ervation of the chri&s;tian &s;abbath. I &s;hall not pretend to enter into the merits of the que&s;tion, whether the civil au|thority can properly give their legi&s;lative &s;upport to an in&s;titution, which has been ju&s;tly con&s;idered, not only as the great palladium of religion, but as con|tributing, in a variety of ways, to promote the civil intere&s;ts of mankind; and as particularly favorable for communicating moral in&s;truction to the public mind. The exi&s;tence of the act is a proof, that the interference of government was con&s;idered as proper. But if any interference was proper, why not an effec|tual one? The act referred to, is manife&s;tly loaded with embarra&s;&s;ments, apparently de&s;igned to prevent
<PB N="21" REF="036049_0019_10080C101E339910">
its efficacy. Whether an act of this nature, is more injurious, or beneficial I &s;hall not pretend to deter|mine; but it is devoutly to be wi&s;hed, that the go|vernments of a chri&s;tian country would appear as engaged to &s;upport the chri&s;tian &s;abbath, as the government of France is to &s;upport the honors of their decadi. The call of duty is obeyed, and your wi&s;dom mu&s;t decide. Feeling the dependance of all created nature on its glorious author, you will &s;eek, and I pray that you may receive, in&s;truction from the great fountain of light.</P>
<P>A few ob&s;ervations to this numerous a&s;&s;embly will conclude this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>FATHERS, BRETHREN AND FELLOW CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH plea&s;ure we recognize on this joyful oc|ca&s;ion, this great leading principle both in our State and Federal Government, that the &s;cource of power is the people. This day brings into view the plea&s;ing truth, that we are &s;till in the full, and undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the important privilege of choo&s;ing to whom, among many worthy citizens, we will com|mit our mo&s;t precious political intere&s;ts. You now &s;ee before you tho&s;e venerable characters to who&s;e &s;upe|rior wi&s;dom, information and patrioti&s;m you have committed the weighty concerns of government.&mdash;Let me a&s;k! are they not men in whom you can con|fide? men of known wi&s;dom, and approved fidelity? men of your own choice? Let them then have your confidence; and cordially and firmly unite with them in maintaining the authority of the laws, and the in|violability of the con&s;titution. As we would exhi|bit a character becoming men and chri&s;tians, and ap|prove our&s;elves capable of enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of a rational freedom, let us fixedly di&s;countenance a practice, which has unhappily become too prevalent, of &s;peaking evil of dignities, of indulging groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picions of our rulers, and criminating, with un|bounded licentiou&s;ne&s;s, the mea&s;ures of Government. A practice as unrea&s;onable and wicked, as it is ruinous and de&s;tructive. Our enemies have di&s;covered this weakne&s;s, and have made it their principal point of

attack, to &s;eperate us from our Government, and to de&s;troy our confidence in tho&s;e exalted characters, who&s;e faithful exertions in the cau&s;e of their country, have ju&s;tly rendered them the admiration of the world. It is of no &s;mall importance to Americans to di&s;tingui&s;h their real from their pretended friends. In a political, no le&s;s than a religious &s;en&s;e, does the di|vine caution merit your attention; <HI>beware of fal&s;e prophets who come to you in &s;heeps cloathing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</HI> The man who would per|&s;uade you that religion is calculated to en&s;lave the free born mind, and athei&s;m the only ba&s;is of inde|pendence; that a &s;pirit of jealou&s;y is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;up|port a republican government, that France is a friend to the rights of mankind in general, or of America in particular; that the venerable character who pre|&s;ides over the&s;e States, is either ignorant of, or un|friendly to their intere&s;ts, and that WASHINGTON is betraying the country he &s;o gloriou&s;ly pre&s;erved from ruin at the hazard of life, and by the &s;acrifice of every dome&s;tic comfort, of men, who would po&s;|&s;e&s;s you of &s;uch &s;entiments, beware. They are de|&s;troyers of your good. It would be unju&s;t indeed to attach the odious epithet of &s;inner to all who advo|cate &s;uch political opinions&mdash;many doubtle&s;s who are real friends to the intere&s;ts of their country, are led a&s;tray, <HI>by the cunning craftine&s;s of tho&s;e who lie in wait to deceive,</HI> but the prevalence of &s;uch principles will a&s;&s;uredly reduce us to a level with tho&s;e unhappy na|tions, from whom we are now &s;o gloriou&s;ly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.</P>
<P>O my countrymen! can you endure to &s;ee the ri&s;ing glories of America era&s;ed, and the beautiful fabric which you have erected at &s;uch expence &s;inking into ruins? will you renounce that GOD who has been &s;o remarkably the GOD, and Benefactor of America, for the vain phantom of philo&s;ophy; and abjure your religion, that precious boon, for which our pious ance&s;tors prefered a dreary wilderne&s;s, to all the de|lights of cultivated Europe?

To con&s;ent to &s;in, is virtually to con&s;ent to this; for in &s;omething thus reproachful, thus deplorable will &s;in end. We have no enemy to fear but &s;in.
