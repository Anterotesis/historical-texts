<P>PARTICIPATING in the general grief, occa&s;ioned by the death of our illu&s;trious countrymen GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON, our village by a unanimous re&s;olution of its citizens, appointed Friday the 27th in&s;t. to be &s;et apart as a day of &s;pecial mourn|ing, accompanied with &s;olemn exerci&s;es of devotion: conceiving that the &s;acred duties of religion, would not only be the highe&s;t tribute of re&s;pect to the memory of the late beloved Father of his country, but al&s;o, the mo&s;t &s;uitable expre&s;&s;ion of humble re|&s;ignation to this afflictive di&s;pen&s;ation of an over-ruling Provi|dence, in who&s;e hands are the i&s;&s;ues of life and death, in who&s;e &s;overeign will is &s;u&s;pended the &s;ate of men and empires, and who&s;e gracious interpo&s;itions have been &s;o manife&s;tly di&s;played in the events of American hi&s;tory,</P>
<P>IN recording the ceremonies ob&s;erved on this melancholy and never-to-be-forgotten occa&s;ion, we do not pre&s;ume that the mo|de&s;t evidences of our unfeigned &s;orrow, can po&s;&s;ibly &s;hed any lu&s;tre on a name, which far tran&s;cends all human prai&s;e. The plain and &s;imple recital of our village rites will te&s;tify, that tho'

among the lea&s;t, we were not la&s;t, to di&s;play within our humble &s;phere, emotions of &s;ympathy, in uni&s;on with our brethren of the United States. Following the dictates of pure and genuine gra|titude to the memory of the man, who under God, was the in|&s;trument of our country's independence, every cla&s;s of citizens combined in one common effu&s;ion and liberal indulgence of the fine&s;t feelings of the human heart.</P>
<P>PURSUING the plan previou&s;ly adopted by the Committee of Arrangements, the Proce&s;&s;ion formed at the Academy, with the Military in front, under the command of Major Beach, and moved at 12 o'clock in the following order:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Mu&s;ic, playing a dead march with muffled drums.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Captain Hay's Company of Light Infantry.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Captain Van Ar&s;dale's Company of Federal Blues, with their &s;tandard dre&s;&s;ed in mourning.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Captain Parkhur&s;t's Company of Artillery.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Captain John&s;on's Company of Cavalry, di&s;mounted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Field Officers, and Officers of Militia.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The Rev. Clergy of the town with &s;car&s;s, and the Clergy of the vicinage.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. The members of St. John's Lodge.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. The Magi&s;trates.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. Captain (Colonel) Hay's Company of Silver Greys.</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. Preceptors and Scholars.</ITEM>
<ITEM>12. Citizens.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>ALTOGETHER compo&s;ing perhaps as numerous a Proce&s;&s;ion as have ever been a&s;&s;embled in this town.</P>
<P>THE Military marched with rever&s;ed arms, and on arriving at the Church door, opened their ranks, the whole facing inwards, and re&s;ting on their arms, formed an avenue through which the remainder of the Proce&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="037875_0005_100F5EE8B3C54BC0">THE ceremonies of the Church were introduced by the Rev. Doctor Ogden in a well adapted prayer. The Rev. Doctor Macwhorter delivered the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e. A crouded audi|ence li&s;tened with profound attention, and a multitude of eyes were &s;uffu&s;ed with the precious cry&s;tal of melting &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>As the mo&s;t appropriate mark of re&s;pect to the <HI>Fir&s;t of Citi|zens,</HI> the Addre&s;s of the late Pre&s;ident, on his declining a re-elec|tion, was read by Alexander C. Macwhorter, E&s;q. The impor|tant advice contained in this la&s;t legacy, could never come more home to the bo&s;oms of Americans than at this &s;olemn moment&mdash; It was the voice of WASHINGTON, &s;peaking from the tomb.</P>
<P>DIVINE Service being concluded, the troops formed in front of the Church, and the Proce&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ing through in inverted order, they marched with &s;houldered arms and unmuffled drums to the Academy, where the whole was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould do inju&s;tice to the &s;ubject, were we to conclude without a remark on the decorum and orderly conduct ob&s;erv|ed by every de&s;cription of per&s;ons on this mournful occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>NOT a &s;ingle incident occurred but what will bear a plea&s;ing retro&s;pect; and in our village annals, this day may be tran&s;mit|ted to po&s;terity un&s;ullied with a &s;tain.</P>
<P>WERE we to di&s;criminate any individual circum&s;tance as de|&s;erving more particular notice than the re&s;t, we &s;hould &s;elect the fraternity of Free Ma&s;ons, who&s;e &s;hare in the Proce&s;&s;ion attract|ed every eye, and gave a &s;olemn dignity to the whole. The em|blems and badges of the order were all veiled in the deepe&s;t mourning; and a monumental Obeli&s;k<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Obeli&s;k (&s;ince repo&s;ited on the Altar of St. John's Lodge in this town) is three feet in height: con&s;i&s;ting of a ba&s;e and pyramid of accurate proportion, repre&s;enting black marble. The front of which, exhibits an exact likene&s;s of General Wa&s;hing|ton, in white bas-relief, above which are ma&s;onic emblems in pearl and gold. The remaining three &s;ides contain the three great characteri&s;tics of chri&s;tianity, Faith, Hope, and Charity, al&s;o in white bas-relief. On the ba&s;e are in&s;cribed the name and dates of the age and death of the bright luminary of the we&s;tern world, with monumental in&s;criptions.

<HEAD>A FUNERAL SERMON, DELIVERED IN NEWARK, DEC. 27, 1799. BY ALEXANDER MACWHORTER, D. D.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIENDS
AND FELLOW CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THROUGHOUT a mini&s;terial life of more than forty-one years, I never &s;tood in the &s;acred de&s;k with &s;o much reluctance, as on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.&mdash;The object, you wi&s;h to be eulogized, and to be portrayed in all the colours and dark &s;hades of weeping &s;orrow, is far beyond my feeble pencil, and trembling hand.&mdash;It &s;eemed to me impo&s;&s;ible, either to evade, or decently excu&s;e my &s;elf from a compliance with the honorable and &s;olicitous reque&s;t of my re&s;pected Town&s;men.&mdash;But, it is now too late to offer unavailing apology.</P>
<P>THE text I have &s;elected as the theme for our mournful me|ditations, you find recorded in</P>
<P>DEUT. XXXIV. 5. So Mo&s;es the Servant of the Lord died.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON the great!&mdash;WASHINGTON the admired!&mdash; WASHINGTON the beloved!&mdash;is no more.&mdash;Doleful the &s;ound! &mdash;Painful the thought!&mdash;How exten&s;ive is the &s;troke!&mdash;How deep the wound!&mdash;A nation groans&mdash;clothes her&s;elf in &s;able weeds&mdash;and pours forth the bittere&s;t lamentations&mdash;Sorrow fills
<PB N="2" REF="037875_0008_100F5EEFE2E3CB10">
the heart, and a melancholy &s;adne&s;s broods on every counte|nance.</P>
<P>BUT, while we pay the ju&s;t tribute of mourning, in honor of the decea&s;ed, and &s;hed the tear of &s;ympathetic woe, let us re|member as men and chri&s;tians, that the Lord God Almighty lives;&mdash;He &s;its at the head of the univer&s;e;&mdash;directs all events throughout his exten&s;ive dominions in infinite wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s.&mdash;<Q>A &s;parrow falls not to the ground without the notice of our heavenly Father, and the hairs of our heads are all num|bered with him.</Q></P>
<P>IT cannot be expected that the character of this eminent man can be portrayed at this time.&mdash;The genius of the poet, and the energetic eloquence of the orator would fail in the great attempt: how far then mu&s;t my feeble powers &s;hrink from daring &s;uch an undertaking.&mdash;Poets and orators will no doubt exert all their learned abilities upon this &s;ubject; but, it is the &s;imple retail of the hi&s;toric page, which alone will be able to do ju&s;tice to a life &s;o extraordinary.</P>
<P>ALL we &s;hall pretend to, on this mournful day, will only be,&mdash; to touch upon a few of the outlines of &s;ome of his virtues,&mdash;&s;ome of his more prominent excellencies,&mdash;and direct our minds to &s;uch chri&s;tian reflections, as may be a proper improvement of this gloomy di&s;pen&s;ation of divine providence.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;onage &s;hone con&s;picuou&s;ly in a multi|tude of the private virtues.&mdash;It is recorded of Mo&s;es, and given as a &s;ummary of his private character; <Q>That he was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.</Q>&mdash; So with regard to <HI>him,</HI> the laws of meekne&s;s, kindne&s;s and bene|volence ever dwelt upon his lips. And for many years Mount Vernon has appeared to be the re&s;idence of ho&s;pitality, liberality and charity. What thou&s;ands, and thou&s;ands have experienced
<PB N="3" REF="037875_0009_100F5EF233B8C4B8">
the ble&s;&s;ings of his beneficent hand?&mdash;What Job, in ancient times, the greate&s;t man in all the Ea&s;t, declared, with re&s;pect to him|&s;elf, may with &s;triking propriety be applied to him. He <Q>de|livered the poor that cried, and the fatherle&s;s, and him that had none to help him.</Q> He <Q>cau&s;ed the widow's heart to &s;ing for joy.</Q> Yea, he "was a father to the poor." He <Q>broke the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the &s;poil out of his teeth.</Q> He <Q>witheld not the poor from their de&s;ire, or cau&s;ed the eyes of the widow to fail, or eat his mor&s;el alone.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GEN. WASHINGTON was an uniform profe&s;&s;or of the chri&s;tian religion. He &s;teadily di&s;countenanced vice; abhored the principles of infidelity, and the practices of immorality. He was a con&s;tant and devout attendant upon divine wor&s;hip. In the army he kept no chap|lain of his own, but attended divine &s;ervice with his Brigades, in ro|tation, as far as conveniency would allow; probably to be an exam|ple to his officers, and &egrave;ncourage his &s;oldiers to re&s;pect religion. He &s;teadily attended the wor&s;hip of God when Pre&s;ident. He was not in this re&s;pect like too many, who practically declare them&s;elves &s;uperior to honoring their Maker in the offices of religion. He firmly believed in the exi&s;tence of God and his &s;uperintending providence. This appears in almo&s;t all his &s;peeches and proclamations. He was educated in the Epi&s;copal Church, and always continued a member thereof, and was an ornament to the &s;ame. He was truly of a catholic &s;pirit, and con|&s;idered the di&s;tinctions of the great denominations of chri&s;tians, rather as <HI>&s;hades</HI> of difference, than any thing &s;ub&s;tantial, or e&s;&s;ential to &s;al|vation. After Pre&s;ident Wa&s;hington's inauguration into his high <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffice in New-York, knowing the multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s to which he mu&s;t attend, and that he mu&s;t not be interrupted by continual vi&s;itants, "he a&s;&s;igned every Tue&s;day and Friday, between the hours of two and three, for receiving vi&s;its, and that vi&s;its of compliments on other days, <HI>and particularly on Sundays,</HI> will not be agreeable to him." I pro|duce this quotation to &s;how the great reverence he had for the Lord's day.</NOTE></P>
<P>ONE thing very remarkable in him, and was often ob&s;erved by
<PB N="4" REF="037875_0010_100F5EF3B93ED4B8">
his friends; how it was po&s;&s;ible for a man, who&s;e mind was full of cares, perplexities, embarra&s;&s;ments, and great concerns, to attend at all times, with the graces of the polite&s;t ea&s;e, to the various <HI>minu|tiae</HI> of what is &s;tiled <HI>good breeding,</HI> or the accompli&s;hed gentleman.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All ranks of men even to children were objects of his peculiar po|litene&s;s, A mode&s;t and placid &s;erenity ever &s;urrounded him. Of what multitudes of little ones did he take a tender and conde&s;cending notice? And ladies of every cla&s;s univer&s;ally acknowledged with pride his re|&s;pectful attention. He was a per&s;on of &s;uch fini&s;hed politene&s;s, that by-&s;tanders would &s;uppo&s;e, he had nothing el&s;e to attend to, but the etiquette of genteel ceremony. He was hardly ever known, to be in|cident to ab&s;ence of mind.</NOTE></P>
<P>HIS capacious mind was not only formed for the grand arts of war, policy, and legi&s;lation, but it comprehended the common arts of life to an exceeding high degree. He was one of the mo&s;t &s;killful and &s;ucce&s;sful hu&s;bandmen in his country. He not only cultivated, and improved his own farm in the mo&s;t ad|vantageous and beautiful manner, but he greatly improved the farms of his neighbours in various parts around him by his ex|ample and by his in&s;truction. So that in this line, he might be &s;tiled, <HI>a compleat farmer.</HI></P>
<P>BESIDES this, he had a poli&s;hed ta&s;te for many of the fine arts, and for the graces of certain branches of polite literature. He exceeded the mo&s;t of men in epi&s;tolary writing. The volumes of his letters, which have been publi&s;hed will remain a &s;tanding mo|nument of his exalted accompli&s;hments in this re&s;pect. The world has been &s;tunned for ages with encomiums upon the epi&s;|tles of Cicero and Pliny, as models of perfection in this &s;pecies of learning; but, let them be compared with the former, I mu&s;t be &s;trangely mi&s;taken, if their glory will not extremely &s;uffer, and probably be totally over&s;hadowed by the experiment.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Con&s;ider the va&s;t difference of the education and employments of Cicero and Pliny from Wa&s;hington. The former were educated in all the learning of Greece and Rome. Compo&s;ition was their bu&s;ine&s;s from their youth. They wrote in all the quietude of retirement; but the letters of the latter had no advantages either from a common liber|al education or common &s;tudy. They were written upon the &s;pur of the monument, and generally in the hurry, tumult and confu&s;ion of war; and many of them, I may &s;ay, amid&s;t the beating of drums and din of arms. Yet the native productions of his pen, flowing from his &s;uperior genius, and as if it were from an in&s;pired poli&s;h of literature, in my pinion, far exceed them, and will be much better models for the imi|tation of youth.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="037875_0011_100F5EF653F13980">HE wrote with amazing facility and readine&s;s; communicat|ed his ideas with the greate&s;t preci&s;ion, per&s;pecuity and energy. Oftentimes during the late war, he had to direct and correct in various in&s;tances the proceedings of Congre&s;s. By the &s;tretch of his &s;agacity and &s;uperiority of knowledge he frequently fla&s;hed conviction upon the minds of that great hou&s;e, eminent for wi&s;|dom and under&s;tanding, &s;o as to induce them to adopt his mea|&s;ures, and alter or relinqui&s;h their own. His labors in writing in that perilous period were immen&s;e; and were there not the mo&s;t incontrovertible evidences thereof, would &s;eem to exceed all credibility. His military orders, his letters to Congre&s;s, &amp;c. compo&s;e more than thirty volumes in folio, which are pre&s;erved in the national archives.</P>
<P>LET us now contemplate this great man in his military char|acter. With ju&s;tice it may be &s;aid, "He was a man of war from his youth." When he was very young, he girded on the &s;word, and entered the martial field for the defence and protection of his country. In the beginning of what is called, <HI>The la&s;t French War,</HI> the French and Indians made incur&s;ions into the frontiers of Virginia. Young Wa&s;hington, with a few militia companies of about three hundred men, immediately flew into the wilder|ne&s;s to repel the invading aggre&s;&s;ors. The enemy were nume|rous
<PB N="6" REF="037875_0012_100F5EF80C147010">
far beyond his expectation. The advanced and reconnoi|tering parties had &s;kirmi&s;hed. He determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to check the enemy's progre&s;s. For this purpo&s;e he threw up a ha&s;ty and trifling fortification, in a place in that country called a <HI>glade</HI> or <HI>&s;avannah,</HI> which is a &s;pace of flat ground de&s;titute of trees, and generally of &s;hrubbery. This wi&s;e manoeuvre was to oblige the enemy to leave their coverts and their trees, and make the attack in the open plain. The enemy, con&s;cious of their va&s;t &s;uperiority, con&s;i&s;ting of nine hundred French, be&s;ides Indians, &s;ure of conque&s;t, ru&s;hed furiou&s;ly to the a&s;&s;ault. They were firmly received, and the action became &s;evere and dreadful. More than half of Wa&s;hington's corps was &s;lain by his &s;ide, and more than twice that number of the enemy fell. The final con|clu&s;ion of this bloody &s;cene was, that the French commander, finding with what brave and de&s;perate men he had to deal, of|fered him an honorable capitulation, which Wa&s;hington accept|ed, and nobly marched off with the honors of war.&mdash;Although he lo&s;t the field, yet he gained what was equal to a victory, by arre&s;ting the progre&s;s of the enemy, and covering the frontier &s;ettlements. His conduct, his bravery, and his military genius di&s;played at that time, acquired for him great renown, and turn|ed the attention of the public mind towards him. This was the beginning of that a&s;toni&s;hing martial fame, to which in proce&s;s of time he arrived.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The event to which I have alluded took place in the year <HI>1754,</HI> but it will be &s;aid I ought to have introduced him to public view pre|vious to this. I well know, that ju&s;t after he pa&s;t his age of <HI>21,</HI> in the year <HI>1753,</HI> he was honored with a commi&s;&s;ion by Mr. Dinwiddie, then governor of Virginia, to M. St. Piere, the commander of a French Fort erected on the Ohio, <Q>to demand the rea&s;on of his ho&s;tile proceedings, and to require him to withdraw his forces.</Q>&mdash;How he travelled thro' a trackle&s;s wilderne&s;s of hundreds of miles with only a &s;ingle companion with their provi&s;ions on their back, and how he was treated by the haughty Frenchman, and &s;ent back with ignominy and contempt, every one may &s;ee in the hi&s;tories of tho&s;e times.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037875_0013_100F5EFA5922E020">THE campaign of the following year, according to my re|collection, when Gen. Braddock, a veteran Engli&s;h officer, with a re&s;pectable European army under his command, accompanied with &s;trong colonial additions, marched for the purpo&s;e of de&s;|troying Fort Du Que&s;ne, (now Fort Pitt) and driving the ene|my from that quarter; exterminating them from our territory, and giving deliverance to an exten&s;ive frontier of our country.</P>
<P>AT this period our ri&s;ing hero was only a common aid in the general's family. This mighty European, utterly ignorant of the wiles and prowe&s;s of the foe, plunged precipitately forward, leaving part of his army far in his rear, &s;oon fell into an Ambu&s;|cade. He him&s;elf was killed, and his forces routed by an enemy perhaps, he never &s;aw.

Or imbibe the &s;pirit of mourning Job, and &s;ay, <Q>The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away, ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord.</Q> Chri&s;tian re&s;ignation excludes de&s;pondercy.&mdash;That God who rai&s;ed up a Wa&s;hington, and furni&s;hed him with all tho&s;e important and brilliant qualifications; rendered him &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing to mankind, and made him the father and &s;aviour of his country, can and will rai&s;e up another, whenever he &s;hall deem it expedient for the good of the world, and &s;imilar circum&s;tances require it.</P>
<P>A &s;econd improvement, we and our land &s;hould make of this calamitous event, which has cau&s;ed us to con&s;ecrate this day to mourning and &s;orrow is, to render gratitude to the Supreme Ru|ler of the Univer&s;e, that he enriched this country with his inval|uable life &s;o long. We &s;hould offer upon this &s;olemnity to in|dulgent and merciful heaven, &s;ouls full, running over, and pre&s;&s;ed down, of grateful &s;entiments. I too well know it is in|cident to human nature, the longer we have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a precious ble&s;&s;ing, and the more our hearts are attached to it, when the unhappy hour of its removal comes, the more we are prone to

murmur and complain. Even ble&s;&s;ings, which in the enjoy|ment we cared but little for, when taken away, our feelings are apt to ri&s;e in re&s;entment. The&s;e things, with a thou&s;and others exhibit to view the exceeding great depth, &s;ubtle and tortuous na|ture of the moral corruption in the children of men. Alas! let a favorite object depart, and be everla&s;tingly &s;eparated from us, how is gratitude, chri&s;tian gratitude, for its long continuance, thrown into a very di&s;tant back ground.&mdash;You may think it &s;trange I &s;hould preach gratitude upon this melancholy day; but were I preaching to his neare&s;t connections, to the wife of his bo&s;om overwhelmed in &s;orrow, and to all his tender dome&s;|tics, pouring out their weeping &s;ouls around his hear&s;e, I would preach to them, as a part of their duty, gratitude and thank&s;|giving as a principal &s;ource, from whence flow the refre&s;hing &s;treams of &s;uccor and con&s;olation.

<HEAD>ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT, TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and Fellow-Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE period for a new election of a Citizen, to admini&s;ter the executive government of the United States being not far di&s;|tant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts mu&s;t be employed in de&s;ignating the per&s;on, who is to be cloathed with that important tru&s;t, it appears to me proper, e&s;pecially as it may conduce to a more di&s;tinct expre&s;&s;ion of the public voice, that I &s;hould now appri&s;e you of the re&s;olution I have formed, to decline being con&s;idered among the number of tho&s;e, out of whom a choice is to be made.</P>
<P>I BEG you at the &s;ame time to do me the ju&s;tice to be a&s;&s;ured, that this re&s;olution has not been taken, without a &s;trict regard to
<PB N="26" REF="037875_0030_100F5F2B1F23C570">
all the con&s;iderations appertaining to the relation, which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that in withdrawing the tender of &s;ervice which &s;ilence in my &s;ituation will imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future intere&s;t; no deficiency of grateful re&s;pect for your pa&s;t kindne&s;s; but am &s;upported by a fall conviction that the &s;tep is compatible with both.</P>
<P>THE acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which your &s;uffrages have twice called me, have been an uniform &s;acrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what appeared to be your de&s;ire. I con&s;tantly hoped that it would have been much earlier in my power, con&s;i&s;tently with motives, which I was not at liberty to di&s;regard, to return to that retirement from which I had beeen reluctantly drawn. The &s;trength of my inclination to do this, previous to the la&s;t elec|tion, had even led to the preparation of an addre&s;s to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical po&s;ture of our affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of per&s;ons entitled to my confidence, impelled me to abandon the idea.</P>
<P>I REJOICE, that the &s;tate of your concerns, external as well as internal, no longer renders the pur&s;uit of inclination incompati|ble with the &s;entiment of duty or propriety: and am per&s;uaded whatever partiality may be retained for my &s;ervices, that in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of our country, you will not di&s;approve of my determination to retire.</P>
<P>THE impre&s;&s;ions with which I fir&s;t undertook the arduous tru&s;t, were explained on the proper occa&s;ion. In the di&s;charge of this tru&s;t, I will only &s;ay, that I have with good intentions contributed towards the organization and admini&s;tration of the government, the be&s;t exertions of which a very fallible judg|ment was capable. Not uncon&s;cious, in the out-&s;et, of the infe|riority
<PB N="27" REF="037875_0031_100F5F2D6F567820">
of any qualifications, experience in my own eyes, perhaps &s;till more in the eyes of others, has &s;trengthened the motives to diffidence of my&s;elf: and every day the encrea&s;ing weight of years admoni&s;hes me more and more, that the &s;hade of retire|ment is as nece&s;&s;ary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any circum&s;tances have given peculiar value to my &s;ervices, they were temporary, I have the con&s;olation to believe, that while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political &s;cene, patrioti&s;m does not forbid it.</P>
<P>IN looking forward to the moment which is intended to ter|minate the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to &s;u&s;pend the deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country, for the many honors it has conferred upon me; &s;till more for the &s;tedfa&s;t confidence with which it has &s;upported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manife&s;ting my inviolable attachment, by &s;er|vices faithful and per&s;evering, though in u&s;efulne&s;s, unequal to my zeal. If benefits have re&s;ulted to our country from the&s;e &s;ervices, let it always be remembered to your prai&s;e, and as an in&s;tructive example in our annals, that under circum&s;tances in which the pa&s;&s;ions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mi&s;lead amid&s;t appearances &s;ometimes dubious&mdash;vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune often di&s;couraging&mdash;in &s;ituations in which not unfrequent|ly want of &s;ucce&s;s has countenanced the &s;pirit of critici&s;m&mdash;the con&s;tancy of your &s;upport was the e&s;&s;ential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the plans by which they were effected&mdash;Pro|foundly penetrated with this idea, I &s;hall carry it with me to my grave, as a &s;trong incitement to uncea&s;ing wi&s;hes, that heaven may continue to you the choice&s;t tokens of its benificence: that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual&mdash;that the free con&s;titution, which is the work of your hands, may be &s;a|credly maintained&mdash;that its admini&s;tration in every department may be &s;tamped with wi&s;dom and virtue&mdash;that in fine, the hap|pine&s;s of the people of the&s;e &s;tates, under the au&s;pices of liberty,

may be made complete, by &s;o careful a pre&s;ervation and &s;o pru|dent a u&s;e of this ble&s;&s;ing, as will acquire to them the glory of re|commending it to the applau&s;e, the affection and the adoption of every nation which is yet a &s;tranger to it.</P>
<P>HERE, perhaps, I ought to &s;top. But a &s;olicitude for your welfare, which cannot end but with my life, and the apprehen|&s;ion of danger, natural to that &s;olicitude, urge me on an occa|&s;ion like the pre&s;ent, to offer to your &s;olemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent review, &s;ome &s;entiments, which are the re&s;ult of much reflection, of no incon&s;iderable ob&s;erva|tion, and which appear to me all important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. The&s;e will be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only &s;ee in them the di&s;intere&s;ted warnings of a parting friend, who can po&s;&s;ibly have no per&s;onal motive to bias his coun&s;el. Nor can I forget, as an encourage|ment to it, your indulgent reception of my &s;entiments on a for|mer, and not di&s;&s;imilar occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>INTERWOVEN as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is nece&s;&s;ary to fortify or confirm the attachment.</P>
<P>THE unity of Government, which con&s;titutes you one people, is al&s;o now dear to you. It is ju&s;tly &s;o; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence; the &s;upport of your tran|quility at home; your peace abroad; of your &s;afety, of your pro&s;perity; of that very liberty which you &s;o highly prize. But as it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that from different cau&s;es and from dif|ferent quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employ|ed to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your political fortre&s;s again&s;t which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be mo&s;t con&s;tantly and ac|tively (though often covertly and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">duou&s;ly) directed, it is of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> moment, that you &s;hould properly e&s;timate the immen&s;e
<PB N="29" REF="037875_0033_100F5F314DB41E20">
value of your national Union, to your collective and individual happine&s;s; that you &s;hould cheri&s;h a cordial, habitual and im|moveable attachment to it; accu&s;toming your&s;elves to think and &s;peak of it as of the palladium of your political &s;afety and pro&s;peri|ty, watching for its pre&s;ervation with jealous anxiety; di&s;coun|tenancing whatever may &s;ugge&s;t even a &s;u&s;picion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the fir&s;t dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the re&s;t, or to enfeeble the &s;acred ties which now link together the various parts.</P>
<P>FOR this you have every inducement of &s;ympathy and inter|e&s;t. Citizens by birth or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of AMERICAN, which belongs to you, in your national capacity, mu&s;t always exalt the ju&s;t pride of patrioti&s;m, more than any appellation derived from local di&s;criminations. With &s;light &s;hades of difference, you have the &s;ame religion, manners, hab|its and political principles. You have in a common cau&s;e fought and triumphed together; the independence and liberty you po&s;|&s;e&s;s are the work of joint councils, and joint efforts of common dangers, &s;ufferings and &s;ucce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e con&s;iderations, however powerfully they addre&s;s them&s;elves to your &s;en&s;ibility, are greatly outweighed by tho&s;e which apply more immediately to your intere&s;t. Here every portion of our country finds the mo&s;t commanding motives for carefully guarding and pre&s;erving the Union of the whole.</P>
<P>THE <HI>North,</HI> in an unre&s;trained intercour&s;e with the <HI>South,</HI> pro|tected by the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of the latter, great additional re&s;ources of maritime and commercial enterprize and precious materials of manufac|turing indu&s;try. The <HI>South</HI> in the &s;ame intercour&s;e, benefitting by the agency of the <HI>North,</HI> &s;ees its agriculture grow and its com|merce

expand. Turning partly into its own channels the &s;eamen of the <HI>North,</HI> it finds its particular navigation invigorated&mdash;and while it contributes, in different ways, to nouri&s;h and increa&s;e the general ma&s;s of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime &s;trength, to which it&s;elf is unequally adapted. The <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> in like intercour&s;e with the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> already finds, and in the progre&s;&s;ive improvement of interior communi|cations, by land and water, will more and more find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad, or ma|nufactures at home. The <HI>We&s;t</HI> derives from the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> &s;upplies requi&s;ite to its growth and comfort&mdash;and what is perhaps of &s;till greater cen&s;equence, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity owe the &s;ecure enjoy|ment of indi&s;pen&s;able outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime &s;trength of the At|lantic &s;ide of the Union, directed by an indi&s;&s;oluble community of intere&s;t as <HI>one nation.</HI> Any other tenure by which the <HI>We&s;t</HI> can hold this e&s;&s;ential advantage, whether derived from its own &s;eparate &s;trength, or from an apo&s;tate and unnatural connection with any foreign power mu&s;t be intrin&s;ically precarious.</P>
<P>WHILE then every part of our country thus feels an im|mediate and particular intere&s;t in Union, all the parties combined cannot fail to find in the united ma&s;s of means and efforts, great|er &s;trength, greater re&s;ource, proportionably greater &s;ecurity from external danger, a le&s;s frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and what is of ine&s;timable value they mu&s;t derive from Union an exemption from tho&s;e broils and wars be|tween them&s;elves which &s;o frequently afflict neighboring countries, not tied together by the &s;ame government; which their own ri|val&s;hips alone would be &s;ufficient to produce, but which oppo&s;ite foreign alliances, attachments and intrigues, would &s;timulate and embitter. Hence likewi&s;e they will avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e overgrown military e&s;tabli&s;hments, which under any form of government are inau&s;picious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly ho&s;tile to Republican Liberty: In this
<PB N="31" REF="037875_0035_100F5F352C621B38">
&s;en&s;e it is, that your Union ought to be con&s;idered as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the pre&s;ervation of the other.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations &s;peak a per&s;ua&s;ive language to every re|flecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a primary object of patriotic de&s;ire. Is there a doubt whether a common government can embrace &s;o large a &s;phere? Let experience &s;olve it. To li&s;ten to mere &s;peculation in &s;uch a ea&s;e were criminal. We are authori&s;ed to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the auxiliary agency of govern|ments for the re&s;pective &s;ubdivi&s;ions, will afford a happy i&s;&s;ue to the experiment. 'Tis well worth a fair and full experiment.&mdash; With &s;uch powerful and obvious motives to Union, affecting all parts of our country, while experience &s;hall not have demon&s;tra|ted its impractibility, there will always be rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t the patrioti&s;m of tho&s;e, who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its bands.</P>
<P>IN contemplating the cau&s;es which may di&s;turb our Union, it occurs as a matter of &s;erious concern, that any ground &s;hould have been furni&s;hed for characteri&s;ing parties by <HI>Geographica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> di&s;criminations&mdash;<HI>Northern</HI> and <HI>Southern&mdash;Atlantic</HI> and <HI>We&s;tern</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whence de&s;igning men may endeavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local intere&s;ts and views.

<P>TO the efficay and permanency of your union, a government for the whole is indi&s;pen&s;able&mdash;No alliances, however &s;trict, be|tween the parts can be an adequate &s;ub&s;titute; they mu&s;t inevit|ably experience the infractions and interruptions which all alli|ances in all times have experienced. Sen&s;ible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon your fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, by the adoption of a con&s;titution of government better calculated than your for|mer for an intimate Union, and for the efficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the offspring of our own choice, uninfluinced and unawed, adopted upon full in|ve&s;tigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its prin|ciples, in the di&s;tribution of its powers, uniting &s;ecurity with ener|gy, and containing within it&s;elf a provi&s;ion for its own amendment, has a ju&s;t claim to your confidence and your &s;upport. Re&s;pect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquie&s;cence in its mea|&s;ures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true Liberty. The ba&s;is of our political &s;y&s;tems is the right of the people to make and to alter their Con&s;titutions of Government&mdash;But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Con&s;titution which at any time exi&s;ts, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is &s;acredly obliga|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ory upon all.

They &s;erve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordin|ary force, to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a &s;mall, but artful and enterpri&s;ing minority of the community; and according to the alternate triumphs of dif|ferent parties, to make the public admini&s;tration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of con&s;i&s;tent and whole&s;ome plans, dige&s;ted by com|mon councils, and modified by mutual intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>HOWEVER combinations or a&s;&s;ociations of the above de&s;crip|tion may now and then an&s;wer popular ends, they are likely in the cour&s;e of time and things to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men, will be enabled to &s;ubvert the power of the people, and to u&s;urp for them&s;elves the reins of government; de&s;troying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unju&s;t dominion.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the pre&s;ervation of your government, and the per|manency of your pre&s;ent happy &s;tate, it is requi&s;ite not only that you &s;peedily di&s;countenance irregular oppo&s;itions to its acknow|ledged authority, but al&s;o that you re&s;i&s;t with care the &s;pirit of innovation upon its principles however &s;pecious the pretexts.&mdash; One method of a&s;&s;ault may be to effect in the forms of the con|&s;titution alterations which will impair the energy of the &s;y&s;tem, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown.

Liberty it&s;elf will find in &s;uch a go|vernment, with powers properly di&s;tributed and adju&s;ted, its &s;ure&s;t guardian. It is indeed, little el&s;e than a name, where the government is too feeble to with&s;tand the enterpri&s;es of faction, to confine each member of the &s;ociety within the limits pre&s;cri|bed by the laws, and to maintain all in the &s;ecure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of per&s;on and property.</P>
<P>I have already intimated to you, the danger of parties, in the &s;tate, with particular reference to the founding of them on geo|graphical di&s;criminations. Let me now take a more compre|hen&s;ive view, and warn you in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner again&s;t the baneful effects of the &s;pirit of party, generally.</P>
<P>THIS &s;pirit, unfortunately, is in&s;eperable from our nature, hav|ing its root in the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of the human mind. It ex|i&s;ts under different &s;hapes in all governments, more or le&s;s &s;tif|led, controuled, or repre&s;&s;ed; but in tho&s;e of the popular form, it is &s;een in its greate&s;t rankne&s;s, and is truly their wor&s;t enemy.</P>
<P>THE alternate domination of one faction over another, &s;harpen|ed by the &s;pirit of revenge, natural to party di&s;&s;en&s;ion, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the mo&s;t horrid enormities, is it&s;elf a frightful de&s;poti&s;m.&mdash;But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent de&s;poti&s;m.&mdash;The di&s;orders and mi&s;eries, which re&s;ult, gradually incline the minds of men to &s;eek &s;ecurity and repo&s;e in the ab&s;olute power of an individual&punc; and &s;ooner or later the chief of &s;ome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this di&s;po|&s;ition

to the purpo&s;es of his own elevation, on the ruins of Pub|lic Liberty.</P>
<P>WITHOUT looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which neverthele&s;s ought not to be out of &s;ight) the common and continual mi&s;chiefs of the &s;pirit of party are &s;ufficient to make it the intere&s;t and duty of a wi&s;e People to di&s;courage and re&s;train it.</P>
<P>IT &s;erves always to di&s;tract the Public Councils and enfeeble the Public Admini&s;tration. It agitates the Community with ill-founded jealou&s;ies and fal&s;e alarms; kindles the animo&s;ity of one part again&s;t another, foments occa&s;ionally riot and in&s;urrec|tion. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated acce&s;s to the government it&s;elf through the channels of party pa&s;&s;ions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are &s;ubjected to the policy and will of another.</P>
<P>THERE is an opinion that parties in free countries are u&s;eful checks upon the admini&s;tration of the Government, and &s;erve to keep alive the &s;pirit of Liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in Governments of a Monarchial ca&s;t, Pat|rioti&s;m may look with indulgence, if not with favor upon the &s;pirit of party. But in tho&s;e of the popular character, in Go|vernments purely elective, it is a &s;pirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will always be enough of that &s;pirit for every &s;alutary purpo&s;e. And there being con&s;tant danger of exce&s;s, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion to mitigate and a&s;&s;uage it. A fire not to be quenched; it demands a uniform vigilence to prevent its bur&s;t|ing into a flame, le&s;t, in&s;tead of warming it &s;hould con&s;ume.</P>
<P>IT is important likewi&s;e, that the habits of thinking in a free country, &s;hould in&s;pire caution, in tho&s;e intru&s;ted with its ad|mini&s;tration, to confine them&s;elves within their re&s;pective con&s;ti|tutional

&s;pheres, avoiding in the exerci&s;e of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The &s;pirit of encroach|ment tends to con&s;olidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real de&s;poti&s;m. A ju&s;t e&s;timate of that love of power, and Pronene&s;s to abu&s;e it, which predominates in the human heart, is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy us of the truth of this po&s;ition. The ne|ce&s;&s;ity of reciprocal checks in the exerci&s;e of political power; by dividing and di&s;tributing it into different depo&s;itaries, and con|&s;tituting each the Guardian of the Public Weal again&s;t inva&s;ions by the others has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern: &s;ome of them in our country and under our own eyes. To pre&s;erve them mu&s;t be as nece&s;&s;ary as to in&s;titute them. If in the opinion of the People, the di&s;tribution or modification of the con&s;titutional powers, be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the con&s;titution de&s;ignates.&mdash;But let there be no change by u&s;urpation; for tho' this in one in&s;tance, may be the in&s;trument of good, it is the cu&s;|tomary weapon by which free governments are de&s;troyed.&mdash;The precedent mu&s;t always greatly overbalance in permanent evil, any partial or tran&s;ient benefit which the u&s;e can at any time yield.</P>
<P>OF all the di&s;po&s;itions and habits which lead to political pro&s;|perity, Religion and Morality are indi&s;pen&s;able &s;upports.&mdash;In vain would that man claim the tribute of Patrioti&s;m, who &s;hould labor to &s;ubvert the&s;e great pillars of human happine&s;s, the&s;e firme&s;t props of the duties of Men and Citizens.&mdash;The mere Po|litician, equally with the pious man, ought to re&s;pect and to che|ri&s;h them.&mdash;A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it &s;imply be a&s;ked, where is the &s;ecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if the &s;en&s;e of reli|gious obligation de&s;ert the oaths, which are the in&s;truments of inve&s;tigation in Courts of Ju&s;tice? And let us with caution in|dulge the &s;uppo&s;ition, that morality can be maintained without

religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar &s;tructure; rea&s;on and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in ex|clu&s;ion of religious principles.</P>
<P>'TIS &s;ub&s;tantially true, that virtue or morality is a nece&s;&s;ary &s;pring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or le&s;s force to every &s;pecies of free government. Who that is a &s;incere friend to it can look with indifference upon at|tempts to &s;hake the foundation of the fabric?</P>
<P>PROMOTE then, as an object of primary importance, in&s;titutions for the general diffu&s;ion of knowledge.&mdash;In proportion as the &s;tructure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is e&s;&s;ential that public opinion &s;hould be enlightened.</P>
<P>As a very important &s;ource of &s;trength and &s;ecurity, cheri&s;h public credit. One method of pre&s;erving it is to u&s;e it as &s;par|ingly as po&s;&s;ible; avoiding occa&s;ions of expence by cultivating peace, but remembering al&s;o that timely di&s;bur&s;ements to pre|pare for danger, frequently prevent much greater di&s;bur&s;ements to repel it; avoiding likewi&s;e the accumulation of debt, not only by &s;hunning occa&s;ions of expence, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to di&s;charge the debts which unavoidable wars may have occa&s;ioned, not ungenerou&s;ly throwing upon po&s;terity the burthen which we our&s;elves ought to bear.&mdash;The execution of the&s;e maxims belongs to your repre&s;entatives, but it is nece&s;|&s;ary that public opinion &s;hould co-operate.&mdash;To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is e&s;&s;ential that you &s;hould prac|tically bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there mu&s;t be Revenue; that to have Revenue there mu&s;t be Taxes; that no taxes can be devi&s;ed which are not more or le&s;s incon|venient and unplea&s;ant; that the intrin&s;ic embarra&s;&s;ment in&s;e|perable from the &s;election of the proper objects (which is always
<PB N="38" REF="037875_0042_100F5F4629ACDE78">
a choice of difficulties) ought to be a deci&s;ive motive for a can|did con&s;truction of the conduct of the government in making it, and for a &s;pirit of acquie&s;ence in the mea&s;ures for obtaining Revenue which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.</P>
<P>OBSERVE good faith and ju&s;tice towards all Nations, cultivate peace and harmony with all; Religion and Morality enjoin this conduct; and can it be that good policy does no equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened, and at no di&s;tant period a great Nation, to give to mankind the magnani|mous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted ju&s;tice and benevolence. Who can doubt that in the cour&s;e of time and things the fruits of &s;uch a plan would rich|ly repay any temporary advantages which might be lo&s;t by a &s;teady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a Nation with its Virtue? The experiment, at lea&s;t, is recommended by every &s;entiment which ennobles human nature. Alas? is it rendered impo&s;&s;ible by its vices?</P>
<P>IN the execution of &s;uch a plan, nothing is more e&s;&s;ential than that permanent, inveterate, antipathies again&s;t particular nations, and pa&s;&s;ionate attachments for others &s;hould be excluded: and that in place of them ju&s;t and amicable feelings towards all &s;hould be cultivated. The nation, which indulges towards ano|ther an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondne&s;s, is in &s;ome de|gree a &s;lave. It is a &s;lave to its animo&s;ity or to its affection, either of which is &s;ufficient to lead it a&s;tray from its duty and its intere&s;t. Antipathy in one nation again&s;t another, di&s;po&s;es each more readily to offer in&s;ult and injury, to lay hold of &s;light cau&s;es of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when ac|cidental or trifling occa&s;ions of di&s;pute occur.</P>
<P>HENCE frequent collu&s;ions, ob&s;tinate, envenomed and bloody conte&s;ts. The Nation, prompted by ill will and re&s;entment,
<PB N="39" REF="037875_0043_100F5F47E21DBFD8">
&s;ometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the be&s;t calculations of policy. The government &s;ometimes participates in the national propen&s;ity, and adopts through pa&s;&s;ion what rea|&s;on would reject; at other times, it makes the animo&s;ity of the nation &s;ub&s;ervient to projects of ho&s;tility in&s;tigated by pride, am|bition and other &s;ini&s;ter and pernicious motives. The peace often, &s;ometimes, perhaps, the liberty of Nations has been the victim.</P>
<P>SO likewi&s;e, a pa&s;&s;ionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation facilitating the illu&s;ion of an imaginary common intere&s;t in ca&s;es where no real common intere&s;ts exi&s;ts, and infu&s;ing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation, in the quarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate induce|ment or ju&s;tification. It leads al&s;o to conce&s;&s;ions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to in|jure the Nation making the conce&s;&s;ions: by unnece&s;&s;arily parting with what ought to have been retained; and by exciting jealou|&s;y, ill will, and a di&s;po&s;ition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are witheld:&mdash;And it gives to ambitious, cor|rupted or deluded citizens (who devote them&s;elves to the favor|ite Nation) facility to betray, or &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts of their own country, without odium, &s;ometimes even with popularity; gild|ing with the appearances of a virtuous &s;en&s;e of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the ba&s;e or fooli&s;h compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.</P>
<P>AS avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, &s;uch attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with dome&s;tic factions, to practice the arts of &s;eduction, to mi&s;lead public opinion, to influence or awe the pub|lic Councils I Such an attachment of a &s;mall or weak, towards
<PB N="40" REF="037875_0044_100F5F4A2FEDA740">
a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the &s;atel|lite of the latter.&mdash;Again&s;t the in&s;idious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealou&s;y of a free people ought to be <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> awake; &s;ince hi&s;tory and expe|rience prove that foreign influence is one of the mo&s;t baneful foes of Republican Government. But that jealou&s;y to be u&s;eful mu&s;t be impartial; el&s;e it becomes the in&s;trument of the very influence to be avoided, in&s;tead of a defence again&s;t it. Exce&s;&s;ive partiality for one foreign nation, and exce&s;&s;ive di&s;like of another, cau&s;e tho&s;e whom they actuate to &s;ee danger only on one &s;ide, and &s;erve to veil and even &s;econd the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may re&s;i&s;t the intrigues of the favourite, are liable to become &s;u&s;pected and odious; while its tools and dupes u&s;urp the applau&s;e and confidence of the people, to &s;urrender their intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little <HI>political</HI> connection as po&s;&s;ible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us &s;top.</P>
<P>EUROPE has a &s;et of primary intere&s;ts, which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence &s;he mu&s;t be engaged in fre|quent controver&s;ies, the cau&s;es of which are e&s;&s;entially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it mu&s;t be unwi&s;e in us to im|plicate our&s;elves by artificial ties, in the ordinary vici&s;&s;itudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and colli&s;ions of her friend&s;hips, or enmities.</P>

<P>WHY forego the advantages of &s;o peculiar a &s;ituation? Why quit our own to &s;tand upon foreign ground? Why, by inter|weaving our de&s;tiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and pro&s;perity in the toils of European ambition, rival|&s;hip, intere&s;t, humour or caprice?</P>
<P>'TIS our true policy to &s;teer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world; &s;o far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be under&s;tood as capable of patroni&s;ing infidelity to exi&s;ting engagements. I hold the maxim no le&s;s applicable to public than to private affairs, that hone&s;ty is always the be&s;t policy. I repeat it, therefore, let tho&s;e engage|ments be ob&s;erved in their genuine &s;en&s;e. But in my opinion, it is unnece&s;&s;ary and would be unwi&s;e to extend them.</P>
<P>TAKING care always to keep our&s;elves, by &s;uitable e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, on a re&s;pectable defen&s;ive po&s;ture, we may &s;afely tru&s;t to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies.</P>
<P>HARMONY, liberal intercour&s;e with all nations, are recommend|ed by policy, humanity, and intere&s;t.

Sanctioned by your approving voice, and by that of your Re|pre&s;entatives in both Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, the &s;pirit of that mea|&s;ure has continually governed me; uninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.</P>
<P>AFTER deliberate examination with the aid of the be&s;t lights I could obtain, I was well &s;atisfied that our country, under all the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, had a right to take, and was bound in duty and intere&s;t, to take a neutral po&s;ition. Having taken it, I determined, as far as &s;hould depend upon me, to maintain it, with moderation, per&s;everance and firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE con&s;iderations which re&s;pect the right to hold this con|duct, it is not nece&s;&s;ary on this occa&s;ion to detail. I will only ob&s;erve, that according to my under&s;tanding of the matter, that right, &s;o far from being denied by any of the Belligerent Pow|ers, has been virtually admitted by all.</P>
<P>THE duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, with|out any thing more, from the obligation which ju&s;tice and humanity impo&s;e on every nation, in ca&s;es in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.</P>
<P>THE inducements of intere&s;t for ob&s;erving that conduct will be&s;t be referred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant motive has been to endeavour to gain time to our country to &s;ettle and mature its yet recent in&s;titutions, and to progre&s;s without interruption, to that degree of &s;trength and con&s;i&s;tency, which is nece&s;&s;ary to give it, humanly &s;peaking, the command of its own fortunes.</P>

<P>RELYING on its kindne&s;s in this as in other things, and actuat|ed by that fervent love towards it, which is &s;o natural to a man who views in it the native &s;oil of him&s;elf and his progenitors for &s;everal generations; I anticipate with plea&s;ing expectation that retreat, in which I promi&s;e my&s;elf to realize, without alloy, the &s;weet enjoyment of partaking, in the mid&s;t of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws under a free government&mdash;the ever favourite object of my heart, and the happy reward, and tru&s;t, of our mutual cares, labours and dangers.</P>
