<BIBL>PSALM, LXXXII. 6, 7.</BIBL>
<Q>I HAVE SAID, YE ARE GODS.&mdash;BUT YE SHALL DIE, LIKE MEN; AND FALL, LIKE ONE OF THE PRINCES.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>DEATH makes no di&s;tinction between the high and the low, the rich and the poor, princes and people. Men of high character and exalted &s;tations, in life, are as much expo&s;ed to the infirmities of human nature, and the &s;troke of death, as the common cla&s;s of men. They are equal|ly the po&s;terity of Adam. They are equally under, the &s;entence, <HI>"Du&s;t thou art, and unto du&s;t &s;halt thou return."</HI> To them it is, equally, appointed, <HI>"Once to die."</HI> In reflecting on the common mortality of man, the wi&s;e king of I&s;rael &s;aid, <HI>"There is no man, that hath power over the &s;pirit, to retain the &s;pirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: And there is no di&s;|charge, in that war."</HI> For, in this re&s;pect, <HI>"All things come alike to all; there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him, that &s;acrificeth and to him, that &s;acrificeth not; as is the good, &s;o is the &s;inner; and he, that &s;weareth; as he, that feareth an oath."</HI></P>

In de&s;cribing the common fatality of all men, and their equal expo&s;ure to <HI>'The king of terrors,'</HI> a certain elegant poet &s;ays,
<Q><L><HI>With equal foot, impartial fate</HI></L>
<L><HI>Knocks at the palace, as the cottage gate.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame appears to be the &s;entiment contained in the words of our text: <HI>"I have &s;aid, ye are gods.&mdash;But ye &s;hall die, like men; and fall, like one of the princes."</HI> Your &s;tation is exalted. You are rai&s;ed to high power and authority among your fellow creatures. In point of intere&s;t, character, and influence, you are rai&s;ed above the common level, and have obtained the title of gods on earth. But the&s;e high di&s;tinctions &s;hall not exempt you from di&s;ea&s;e, pain, and death.</P>
<P>To the rulers, in the Jewi&s;h church, were the words of our text, fir&s;t, addre&s;&s;ed. The government of this church was theocratic. The Mo&s;t High God was their particular king. He formed their mode of government. He made their laws, and ordained all their rules of di&s;cipline. In the fir&s;t, di&s;tinct, forma|tion of their government, he appointed Mo&s;es and Aaron to be the chief rulers over his people, and gave directions, in what manner, their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;hould be introduced into office, and inve&s;ted with power over the people.</P>
<P>As the government of the Jews was theocratic, as God was their particular king, &s;o all the officers cho&s;en to govern this people, and introduced accord|ing to divine appointment, were the legal repre&s;enta|tives of the Mo&s;t High. They repre&s;ented his per|&s;on, maje&s;ty, and power, by requiring obedience to his commands, and by puni&s;hing di&s;obedience with exemplary puni&s;hment. Their high power and au|thority, their exalted character and re&s;pectability they
<PB N="7" REF="036793_0006_100B0F3F8ECF6D78">
received, by &s;pecial delegation, from God. They were his judicial and executive officers, to judge in matters of controver&s;y between man and man, and to inflict the penalties of his kingdom. Referring, if we mi&s;take not, to the delegated power of the of|ficers, in God's holy kingdom, Paul commands the followers of Chri&s;t, in the&s;e words: <HI>"Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject unto the higher powers: For there is no power but of God; the powers, that be, are ordained of God." (Rom.</HI> 13. 1.<HI>)</HI> And becau&s;e of this delegated power, the rulers in I&s;rael were called gods. In the context, it is ob&s;erved, <HI>"God &s;tandeth in the congregation of the mighty: He judgeth among the gods."</HI> The judges, in I&s;|rael, you &s;ee, were &s;tiled gods, as being the legal re|pre&s;entatives of Jehovah, acting in his kingdom, ve&s;t|ed with his authority, and carrying into execution the laws of his hou&s;e. And being God's repre&s;enta|tives, they were under the mo&s;t &s;olemn obligation <HI>"To defend the poor and fatherle&s;s, to do ju&s;tice to the af|flicted and needy; to deliver the poor and needy, and rid them out of the hand of the wicked."</HI></P>
<P>Su&s;taining this high character, and being under the&s;e &s;olemn obligations, they were amenable to God for all their conduct, in their judicial and execu|tive departments. On God they were dependent for their being, their high di&s;tinction among men, and their continuance in office. He put them into office; he had a &s;overeign right to continue them in office, and to remove them from office, when and in what manner, he &s;aw fit. And, that they might not be elated with pride, he reminds them of their frailty and mortality. <HI>"I have &s;aid, ye are gods.&mdash;But ye &s;hall die, like men; and fall, like one of the princes."</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e remarks apply, in a &s;pecial manner, to the rulers in God's ancient church. They were his &s;ub|jects,
<PB N="8" REF="036793_0007_100B0F411981B190">
his peculiar people, and trea&s;ure. For wi&s;e and holy purpo&s;es, he &s;elected them from among the na|tions of the earth, gave them a code of laws, appoint|ed their rulers, gave them their charge, and inve&s;ted them with all their power.</P>
<P>As among the I&s;raelites, their rulers were &s;ubject to the misfortunes of life; and to the la&s;t, the &s;olemn &s;cene of leaving this &s;tage of action; &s;o it is equally the ca&s;e among other nations of the world. The greate&s;t riches, the highe&s;t office, and re&s;pectability do not exempt men from the &s;hafts of death. As in I&s;rael, their rulers were called gods, from their being inve&s;ted with power over the people; &s;o this charac|ter, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, may be applied to the kings, princes, and great men of other nations.</P>
<P>In what&s;oever government a man may be a ruler, a chief man, he may, in this re&s;pect, be called a god; and yet he is &s;ubject to die, like men; and fall, like one of the princes. Whether a man become a ruler, by the &s;pecial appointment and delegation of God, as among the I&s;raelites; or by hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as in a monarchy; or by a combination of certain great men, as in an ari&s;tocracy; or by the free election of the people, as in a republic; yet his exaltation to of|fice and dignity does not liberate him from the com|mon evils of life, nor from death, <HI>"the la&s;t debt of na|ture."</HI> Power and authority are no pre&s;ervatives from &s;ickne&s;s and mortality. Con&s;umptions, &s;evers, inflammations, and other mortal di&s;orders will, as &s;oon, &s;eize the con&s;titution of a ruler as a &s;ubject. The &s;ceptre of government, the robe of &s;tate, and the &s;word of power will be no protection, whenever death comes with ha&s;ty &s;trides, apprehends the pri&s;|oner, and is conveying him to the land of &s;ilence. When the &s;ummons of death arrives, nothing can
<PB N="9" REF="036793_0008_100B0F4498BEB780">
with&s;tand its execution. Neither the cries nor wi&s;hes of the people, nor the aid of phy&s;icians, nor riches, nor power, nor u&s;efulne&s;s, will defend, in this awful, trying, moment.</P>
<P>This affecting truth has, lately, been exemplified, in the death of LIEUTENANT GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON.(A) Although born to give liberty and independence to a nation, to rule and protect a nation, he has died, like a man; and fallen, like one of the princes. In his death, America has lo&s;t her fir&s;t char|acter and her be&s;t friend. For more than forty years, his life and talents were devoted to the good of his country, both in the cabinet and field. When a young man, he gave &s;triking evidence of his future greatne&s;s and u&s;efulne&s;s. At this period his wi&s;dom and bravery were eminently di&s;played, in &s;aving the remnant of the American and Briti&s;h army, when General Braddock was defeated by the French and Indians. Endowed with a &s;trong mind, with &s;hining talents, with an a&s;toni&s;hing command over his own pa&s;&s;ions, he early di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, in the li&s;t of &s;ame, and gained the attention and love of America.</P>
<P>That nature produces but one extraordinary man, in an age, is the common remark of hi&s;torians. This age has &s;een George Wa&s;hington appear, on the the|atre of life, and perform wonders, which have a&s;ton|i&s;hed the world. Our affection for him, our admi|ration of his per&s;on, abilities, and u&s;efulne&s;s may, perhaps, be carried too far. But &s;hould we &s;ay, he is the mo&s;t dignified character, that has appeared, in this century, we &s;hould &s;peak the general voice of America, (B) and of Europe. In compari&s;on with him the crowned heads, princes, and generals of Eu|rope appear to lo&s;e their lu&s;tre and dignity. Of the la&s;t king of Pru&s;&s;ia it has been &s;aid, he &s;ent to Gene|ral

Wa&s;hington, in the late war, his own likene&s;s, with this note, "FROM THE OLDEST GENERAL IN EUROPE TO THE GREATEST GENERAL, IN THE WORLD."</P>
<P>The character, who&s;e death we are lamenting, was, principally, formed, in the late American revolution. When America was, cruelly, oppre&s;&s;ed by her mother country, when the Briti&s;h Parliament a&s;&s;umed the right of making laws <HI>to bind us, in all ca&s;es whatever,</HI> and &s;ent her fleets and armies to enforce tho&s;e laws, our eyes were turned to this Great Man. With a brave, intrepid heart, and humble reliance, as we conceive, on the God of armies, he &s;tepped forth to defend his country, and guide her to victory and in|dependence.</P>
<P>As the friction of a diamond will make it &s;hine the brighter; &s;o difficulties and dangers will rou&s;e the heroic &s;oul, and make it appear, in all its native &s;trength. This was the ca&s;e of Wa&s;hington. Taking the command of a weak, undi&s;ciplined, army, he ri&s;qued his life and reputation, in oppo&s;ing a mighty foe. Through un&s;een dangers and difficulties, he led, with a &s;kilful, unerring hand, his little band of heroes, and humbled the pride of an imperious, haughty, nation. (C) Calm and unruffled as the &s;mooth ocean, he could &s;ee, without perplexity, (D) one danger ri&s;ing after another, and yet not deviate from the grand object in pur&s;uit. Con&s;cious of his own integrity, and depending on the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, he per&s;evered with fortitude and con&s;tancy, till he drove the oppre&s;&s;ors from this land of liberty, and gave peace to his country. And, then, with the love of his citizens and applau&s;e of the world, he re|tired to the private walks of life, and the repo&s;e of dome&s;tic happine&s;s.</P>

"When the debility of our Federal &s;y&s;tem had become manife&s;t, and the bonds, which connected the parts of this va&s;t Continent, were di&s;&s;olving, we &s;aw him the Chief of tho&s;e patriots, who formed for us a Con&s;titution, which, by pre&s;erving the Union, will, I tru&s;t, &s;ub&s;tantiate and perpetuate tho&s;e ble&s;&s;|ings our revolution had promi&s;ed to be&s;tow. In obedience to the general voice of his country, calling on him to pre&s;ide over a great people, we &s;aw him, once more, quit the retirement he loved, and in a &s;ea&s;on more &s;tormy and tempe&s;tuous than war it&s;elf, with calm and wi&s;e determination, pur&s;ue the inter|e&s;t of the nation, and contribute, more than any other could contribute, to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of that &s;y&s;tem of policy, which will, I tru&s;t, yet pre&s;erve our peace, our honor, and our independence."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Mar&s;hall's &s;peech, on receiving the news of Wa&s;h|ington's death.</NOTE></P>
<P>Rejoicing in the happine&s;s of America, and willing to exert his talents for her &s;afety, he for&s;ook, the &s;ec|ond time, the &s;weets of private life, a&s;cended the chair of &s;tate, and &s;teered the helm of government, with the &s;ame impartial hand, and the &s;ame impar|tial love, that induced him to wield the &s;word, in her defence. Amid&s;t jarring intere&s;ts and different politics, he appeared to have been influenced, by the highe&s;t good of his fellow citizens. His admini&s;tra|tion was happy and benign. And, abating &s;ome in|&s;tances, the people were contented and pro&s;perous, under his government. For one man to plea&s;e all cla&s;&s;es and de&s;criptions of men, e&s;pecially when their &s;entiments and intere&s;ts are in oppo&s;ition, is, perhaps, impo&s;&s;ible. But, amid&s;t the different views and feel|ings of America, no man, it is pre&s;umed, has, &s;o generally, had the love and confidence of the great
<PB N="12" REF="036793_0011_100B0F4AB45C4430">
body, as the MAN, whom they have, &s;o often, de|lighted to honor.</P>
<P>"Having been twice unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en the Chief Magi&s;trate of a free people, we &s;aw him, at a time, when his re-election, with the univer&s;al &s;uf|frage, could not have been doubted, affording the world a rare in&s;tance of moderation, by withdrawing from his high &s;tation to the peaceful walks of private life. However the public confidence may change, and the public affections fluctuate with re&s;pect to others, yet with re&s;pect to him, they have, in war and in peace, in public and in private life, been as &s;teady as his own firm mind, and as con&s;tant as his own exalted virtues."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the abovementioned &s;peech, which was received after the &s;ermon was delivered. As it contains &s;entiments &s;o noble and &s;o congenial to the feelings of America, it was deemed pro|per to in&s;ert the&s;e extracts.</NOTE></P>
<P>After having retired, the &s;econd time, to the en|dearing &s;cenes of private life, and taken an affection|ate farewel of a grateful people, in an addre&s;s, (E) that honored his genius and his heart, he was, for the third time, called, by the general government, to take the command of the army, they thought proper to rai&s;e for the public &s;afety. In the opinion of can|did and impartial men, this was e&s;teemed an addi|tional lu&s;tre to his glory; as he had been, once be|fore, Commander in Chief of the American Army, and twice cho&s;en to the Supreme Magi&s;tracy of the United States. His accepting a General Lieuten|ancy, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, was clear proof of the goodne&s;s of his heart, and that he preferred the weal of his country to the etiquette of honor.</P>
<P>In private life, he was &s;ocial, courteous, and con|de&s;cending; a tender hu&s;band, a kind friend, and
<PB N="13" REF="036793_0012_100B0F4C75954CE8">
plea&s;ant companion. In public life, he was affable, grave, prudent, and energetic. His eye was piercing, his a&s;pect commanding, (F) and his morals unblem|i&s;hed. (G) Although born and educated in the mid&s;t of plea&s;ures and gaiety, he &s;hone in the morals of a Seneca, the philo&s;ophy of a Socrates, and pat|rioti&s;m of a Cato. In his character were happily blended all the endearing and illu&s;trious qualities of a hu&s;band, a friend, a citizen, a general, and &s;tate&s;|man. With equal facility and grace, he could command the pen, the &s;ceptre, and &s;word. Such were the &s;weetne&s;s of his mind and happy talents, in doing bu&s;ine&s;s, he could refu&s;e, without di&s;obliging; and puni&s;h, without offending. (H) Like Virgil's man of gravity, "At his pre&s;ence the maddening crowd would &s;tand, with li&s;tening ears, and &s;edition hide its head." With a little variation, we may &s;ay of him, as Cicero &s;aid of the celebrated Ro&s;cius, "Though he died in advanced age, yet &s;uch was the excellence and inimitable beauty of his art, that we thought him worthy of living forever."</P>
<P>But he has gone from "The bu&s;y &s;cenes of life" to the world of &s;pirits. He has bidden a farewel, a long, eternal, farewel to his dear and amiable con|&s;ort, to his friends, to his country, to his greatne&s;s, and dignity below the &s;un. "Our Wa&s;hington is no more! The hero, the &s;age, and the patriot of America&mdash;The man, on whom, in times of danger, every eye was turned, and all hopes were placed, lives now <HI>only</HI> in his own great actions, and in the hearts of an affectionate and afflicted people." As David &s;aid of Abner, <HI>"That a prince and a great man is fallen, this day, in I&s;rael;"</HI> &s;o we may &s;ay of the illu&s;trious Wa&s;hington, that a prince and a great man has fallen, in our nation. To &s;ay, he was, in all re&s;pects,
<PB N="14" REF="036793_0013_100B0F4EB7052CB0">
the mo&s;t dignified character in America, is no re|proach to the living. "I receive," &s;aid the Pre&s;ident of the United States, in his an&s;wer to the Hou&s;e, "I receive with great re&s;pect and affection the condo|lence of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives on the melan|choly and afflicting event, in the death of the <HI>mo&s;t illu&s;trious</HI> and <HI>beloved per&s;onage,</HI> which this country has <HI>ever</HI> produced."</P>
<P>In him the officers and &s;oldiers of the late conti|nental army, have lo&s;t a man, whom they loved, feared, and re&s;pected. In him America has lo&s;t her be&s;t general, her wi&s;e&s;t coun&s;ellor, and true&s;t friend. At his death, every heart mu&s;t grieve, and every eye &s;tand big, with the tear of mourning. In this great hero and &s;tate&s;man are &s;trictly verified the words of our text, <HI>"I have &s;aid, ye are gods.&mdash;But ye &s;hall die, like men; and fall, like one of the princes."</HI> Rai&s;ed to eminent &s;tations of honor and tru&s;t, by the unani|mous and repeated voice of America, he di&s;charged his duty with fidelity and punctuality. By un&s;hak|en per&s;everance in righteou&s;ne&s;s, he gained a charac|ter of renown, which has eclip&s;ed the greate&s;t heroes of ancient and modern times. Born to a great for|tune, and endowed with brilliant talents, he devoted his intere&s;t, and time, and abilities, to the good of his country, and deeply fixed his memory in their affections.</P>
<P>But neither his fortune, nor talents, nor character, nor the affections of his citizens, have been able to defend him again&s;t the awful me&s;&s;enger of death. Like a man he has died. Like a prince he has fall|en; and he is, now, &s;lumbering in the &s;ilent tomb, <HI>"not to ri&s;e again, till the heavens be no more."</HI> Though removed, by death, from his friends and country, yet his name will, forever, remain impre&s;&s;ed on their
<PB N="15" REF="036793_0014_100B0F50B9337E60">
hearts, as on pillars of marble. By the page of hi&s;|tory, his memory will be tran&s;mitted to the remote&s;t generations. And, whenever, in future times, the infancy and ri&s;ing glory of America &s;hall be the &s;ub|ject of conver&s;ation, the name of Wa&s;hington will be mentioned, with wonder and delight.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent cri&s;is of human affairs; when &s;uch important and a&s;toni&s;hing events are ri&s;ing to view, on the great theatre of Europe; when <HI>"nation is ri&s;|ing again&s;t nation, and kingdom again&s;t kingdom, and men's hearts are failing them for fear, and for looking for tho&s;e things, that are coming on the earth,</HI> and the calamities of war are raging through cities and towns, and ef|fecting &s;uch awful de&s;truction of men, the death of our illu&s;trious General mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ibly affecting to every true American. Removed as we are from the&s;e dreadful &s;cenes of carnage and de&s;olation; we are, however, in a great mea&s;ure, connected with the politics and revolutions of Europe. And the pre&s;ent times, e&s;pecially in America, <HI>demand men of firmne&s;s, of cool tempers, of di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate hearts, and impartial love</HI> to guide the people in the path of righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;afety. Although we are not de&s;titute of di&s;tingui&s;h|ed characters, both in the cabinet and field, yet the name of Wa&s;hington was <HI>alone</HI> worth a ho&s;t of vete|ran troops. In the courts of Europe, his reputation had ri&s;en to the highe&s;t grade of &s;ame. And, while they viewed him as firmly attached to the con&s;titu|tions and be&s;t good of his country, the pro&s;pect would, naturally, give a check to their intrigues and manoeuvres to draw us, with them&s;elves, into the &s;ame vortex of ruin.</P>
<P>In the late glorious &s;truggle for our rights and lib|erties, when oppre&s;&s;ed by a domineering nation, we &s;aw him at the head of our armies, directing all his
<PB N="16" REF="036793_0015_100B0F5332BB1B38">
plans, with the greate&s;t wi&s;dom, &s;ecrecy, (I) and ex|pedition. When rai&s;ed to the head of civil govern|ment, he appeared in all the &s;agacity and dignity of the mo&s;t profound &s;tate&s;man. And we hoped to have enjoyed, in his la&s;t acceptance of office, his coun&s;el and arm to defend our neutrality and pre|&s;erve peace, in our borders. But America was not de&s;tined to enjoy, any longer, his pre&s;ence, the good of his coun&s;els, nor &s;trength of his arm. At no time, could his departure from this vale of tears have been more intere&s;ting to this land, and to the world. By a &s;udden, unexpected, malady, the &s;ov|ereign di&s;po&s;er of men has taken him from this to the un&s;een world. His &s;un has &s;et forever.&mdash;"No; the name of WASHINGTON&mdash;the American Pre&s;ident and General, will triumph over death; the uncloud|ed brightne&s;s of his glory will illuminate future ages."</P>
<P>To the rulers in America, his death affords a mo&s;t &s;olemn, affecting, admonition. Could greatne&s;s of mind, could dignity of per&s;on, could u&s;efulne&s;s, and the love of his country have pre&s;erved him, he <HI>"would not have died."</HI> But neither greatne&s;s of mind, nor dignity of per&s;on, nor u&s;efulne&s;s, nor the love of one's country is able to retain the &s;pirit, in the hour of death, in who&s;e <HI>'war there is no di&s;charge.'</HI> Al|though exalted to the high &s;tation of gods, yet rulers mu&s;t "die, like men; and fall, like one of the princes." To them the grim <HI>'king of terrors'</HI> will pay no more re&s;pect, than to the lowe&s;t of the peo|ple. From their &s;eats of renown and power, they will be taken down, by the hand of death, and laid in the du&s;t, on a level with their fellow worms.&mdash;From the active &s;cenes of life, of power, and glory, they will, ere long, be &s;ummoned to the bar of that

<P>GENERAL WASHINGTON departed this life, on the 14th December, 1799, of an inflammation in his throat, as appears by a letter from his private Secretary, Mr. Lear, to the Pre&s;ident of the United States. "It is with inexpre&s;&s;ible grief, that I have to announce to you the death of the great and good General Wa&s;hington; he died, la&s;t evening, between 10 and 11 o'clock, after a &s;hort illne&s;s of about twen|ty four hours. His di&s;order was an inflammatory &s;ore throat, which proceeded from a cold, of which he made but little complaint, on Friday. On Saturday morning, about 3 o'clock he became ill.&mdash;Every med|ical a&s;&s;i&s;tance was afforded, but without the de&s;ired effect. His la&s;t &s;cene corre&s;ponded with the who&s;e tenor of his life. Not a groan, nor a complaint, e&s;|caped him, though in extreme di&s;tre&s;s. With perfect re&s;ignation and full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his rea&s;on, he clo&s;ed his well &s;pent life."</P>

<P>The voice of America, re&s;pecting the eminent quali|ties and worth of General Wa&s;hington, is happily ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the communications and doings of the Fed|eral Government, in con&s;equence of receiving the melancholy news of his death.</P>
<P>In his MESSAGE to both hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, the Pre&s;ident &s;ays, "It has plea&s;ed Divine Providence to remove from this life, our excellent fellow citizen GEORGE WASHINGTON, by the <HI>purity</HI> of his character and a long &s;eries of &s;ervices to his country, rendered <HI>illu&s;trious</HI> through the world. It remains for an affec|tionate and grateful people, IN WHOSE HEARTS HE
<PB N="20" REF="036793_0019_100B0F5BCB46EAC8">
CAN NEVER DIE," to pay &s;uitable honor to his memory."</P>
<P>In waiting on the Pre&s;ident, "The Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives" unanimou&s;ly &s;ay, "Penetrated with a &s;en&s;e of the irreparable lo&s;s, &s;u&s;tained by the nation, by the death of that great and good man, the ILLUS|TRIOUS AND BELOVED WASHINGTON," We "wait on you, Sir, to expre&s;s" our "condolence on this melan|choly and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing event."</P>
<P>To which the Pre&s;ident made the following reply, "I receive, with great re&s;pect and affection, the con|dolence of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, on the me|lancholy and afflicting event in the death of THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND BELOVED PERSONAGE, WHICH THIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED. I &s;ympathize with you&mdash;with the nation, and with good men, through the world, on this <HI>irreparable</HI> lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by us all."</P>
<P>To honor this worthy chief, directions have been given to the Navy of the United States, in the&s;e words, "De&s;irous, that the Navy and Marines &s;hould expre&s;s, in common with every other de&s;cription of American citizens, the high &s;en&s;e which all feel of the lo&s;s our country has &s;u&s;tained, in the death of this good and great man, the Pre&s;ident directs, that the ve&s;&s;els of the Navy, in our own, and foreign ports, be put in mourning for one week, by wearing their colors half ma&s;t high, and that the officers of the Na|vy and the Marines, wear crape, on the left arm, be|low the elbow, for &s;ix months."</P>
<P>To the Army of the United States, the orders are given, in the&s;e words, "The Pre&s;ident, with deep re|gret, announces to the Army the death of its beloved Chief, Gen. George Wa&s;hington. Sharing in the grief, which every heart mu&s;t feel for &s;o heavy and afflicting a public lo&s;s and de&s;irous to expre&s;s his high &s;en&s;e of the va&s;t debt of gratitude, which is due to the virtues, talents, and ever memorable &s;ervices of the ILLUSTRIOUS decea&s;ed, he directs, that funeral honors be paid to him, at all the military &s;tations, and that the officers of the army and of the &s;everal
<PB N="21" REF="036793_0020_100B0F5D6C3346F0">
corps of volunteers wear crape on the left arm, by way of mourning, for &s;ix months."</P>
<P>The re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s, on this mournful event, reflect the highe&s;t honor on our nation, and on its late illu&s;trious Chief, now in the man&s;ions of the dead. They are thus expre&s;&s;ed, <HI>"Re&s;olved,</HI> that a Marble Monument be erected, by the United States, in the Capitol, in the city of Wa&s;hington, and that the family of Gen. Wa&s;hington be reque&s;ted, to per|mit his body to be depo&s;ited under it; and that the monument be &s;o de&s;igned as to commemorate the great events of his military and political life.&mdash;That it be recommended to the people of the United States to wear crape, on the left arm, as mourning, for thirty days.&mdash;That there be a funeral proce&s;|&s;ion from Congre&s;s Hall to the German Lutheran Church, in honor of the memory of Gen. George Wa&s;hington, on Thur&s;day the 26 in&s;tant, and that an oration be prepared, at the reque&s;t of Congre&s;s, to be delivered before both Hou&s;es, on that day."</P>
<P>If we look through the annals of all nations, we &s;hall find no evidence, that &s;imilar tribute of re&s;pect was ever paid to the memory of any man. When the great heroes of antiquity died, the world, in&s;tead of being clad in mourning, rejoiced, and felt, not that great, good, and virtuous men had departed from their affections; but that <HI>mon&s;ters,</HI> in human &s;hape, had made their exit. As to the greater part of tho&s;e heroes, they were the mere <HI>&s;courges</HI> of na|tions, and <HI>butchers</HI> of the innocent. But the Ameri|can Hero was humane and benevolent, virtuous and brave, the friend of the people, the defender of his country, the &s;courge of oppre&s;&s;ors, and a &s;hining ex|ample worthy of the imitation of every &s;ucceeding General and Pre&s;ident. At his death all hearts are grieved, and the mourning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>tear &s;tands big in its tran&s;parent &s;luice."</HI> BENNET.</P>

<P>His intrepidity and command over his own pa&s;|&s;ions were truly a&s;toni&s;hing. The hi&s;tory of his re|treat from New-York, his winter's campaign of '77 in the Jer&s;ies, his undaunted bravery in the battles of Brandywyne, Germantown, and Yorktown, are complete illu&s;trations of his character. When &s;ur|rounded by the greate&s;t dangers, he never di&s;covered to tho&s;e near his per&s;on, by a look nor change of voice, nor ra&s;h action, his own apprehen&s;ions. At the&s;e times, what he did, he did with greater di&s;|patch, than was common, without the lea&s;t change of voice, or countenance; and this di&s;patch was the only evidence they had, that he apprehended any dan|ger.

<P>This addre&s;s will forever remain a monument of his abilities and attachment to the con&s;titution and pro&s;perity of his country.

<P>To illu&s;trate this quality of a con&s;ummate general, and how it &s;hone con&s;picuou&s;ly in our departed Chief, we may, ju&s;t, call to the reader's memory, the profound &s;ecrecy and <HI>martial</HI> deception, by which was formed the expedition again&s;t Earl Cornwallis, at Yorktown. To effect this, in the be&s;t manner, fa&s;|cines, boats, and other co&s;tly preparations were made, with manife&s;t intent of invading New York, then un|der the command of Sir Henry Clinton. Letters were written, intercepted, and conveyed to the Briti&s;h General, which &s;trengthened his apprehen&s;ions of be|ing invaded. Wa&s;hington's &s;uddenly cro&s;&s;ing the Hud&s;on, encamping before Staten I&s;land, building ovens, and his other military parade, perplexed the enemy, di&s;tracted their coun&s;els, and they never knew their danger, till they heard, the American Army was at the head of the Elk, in full march again&s;t the troops under Cornwallis. The expedition was crown|ed with &s;ucce&s;s, gave the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the war, and confirmed our independence.</P>
