<P>THE late afflicting di&s;pen&s;ation of Divine Providence, in removing from this life the Fir&s;t Man in the nation, is univer&s;ally felt, and &s;in|cerely lamented. Such is the force of this &s;hock, which millions feel with the keene&s;t &s;en|&s;ibility, that eloquence fails to expre&s;s it, and imagination to paint it.</P>
<P>LET others engage actors on &s;uch occa&s;ions, as &s;ome of the ancients have done, to exhibit external marks of grief&mdash;a vain mockery, which pa&s;&s;eth off like an empty tale: but when the heart is pierced with angui&s;h, even nature her|&s;elf directs to &s;uitable expre&s;&s;ions of it. Such are the tears, and &s;uch the badges of mourning in our nation, on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion. To

mourn with tho&s;e who mourn, is a principle of nature, particularly enforced by the chri&s;tian religion. It is at the &s;ame time a mournful &s;at|isfaction to friends; the means of exciting a laudable emulation among &s;urvivors, and of tran&s;mitting to po&s;terity characters rendered il|lu&s;trious by their public &s;ervices, by their tal|ents, and by their virtues.</P>
<P>I SHALL take the liberty to apply our text to the mournful &s;ubject of our di&s;cour&s;e, although originally expre&s;&s;ive of Zion's &s;orrows: and
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. I SHALL con&s;ider &s;omething of the pub|lic lo&s;s we have &s;u&s;tained&mdash;<HI>The crown is fallen from our head.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THE effect this lo&s;s has produced&mdash;<HI>The joy of our heart is cea&s;ed.</HI> And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>LASTLY, conclude with &s;ome reflections and inferences from the &s;ubject.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. IN con&s;idering the public lo&s;s we have &s;u&s;|tained, it is not to be expected we &s;hould fully di&s;play the character of the departed, nor the greatne&s;s of this national calamity. Indeed it is a &s;ubject &s;o far beyond my feeble powers of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, that I was ready to mourn in &s;ilence, with my beloved country, in this common ca|lamity.
<PB N="7" REF="037487_0006_100D1AD8967786A0">
But le&s;t we &s;hould appear deficient in re&s;pectful attachment to the memory of this be&s;t of men, I have been emboldened to a&s;k your attention to this &s;olemn and affecting &s;ubject&mdash;while I hold up to your view this bright exam|ple of public &s;ervices and private virtues.</P>
<P>HIS fame and great military talents &s;hone con|&s;picuous early in life; and as if de&s;tined by heaven to be the in&s;trument of &s;aving his coun|try, he then, by his fore&s;ight, prudence and bravery, brought off the remnant of a defeated Briti&s;h army, and baffled an enemy of &s;uperior number. This exploit excited &s;everal predic|tions re&s;pecting his future glory.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among the many ob&s;ervations made upon this &s;ubject, we find Pre&s;ident DAVIS, in a Sermon delivered in Virginia, in the year 1755, &s;peaks of him in &s;trains of prai&s;e, and predicts his being a future ble&s;&s;ing to his country.</NOTE> The&s;e pre|dictions have been verified in the late revolu|tionary war. Our countrymen, at the com|mencement of the war, were unprovided with mi|litary &s;tores; untutored in the art of war, and de&s;titute of a leader to direct their military ope|rations. How could they meet the veteran bands of foes, led on by generals grown old in war? Lo! the renowned friend and father of his coun|try, WASHINGTON, appears! The ornament of human nature, to compo&s;e who&s;e character, &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of &s;hining virtues con&s;pire,
<PB N="8" REF="037487_0007_100D1ADB053F75C8">
that it were difficult to mention one mo&s;t emi|nent. His dignity of mien, propriety of man|ners, wi&s;dom in council, valour in the field, di&s;|intere&s;ted patrioti&s;m, inflexible probity, humani|ty to his enemies, &s;ympathy to the &s;uffering, and veneration for virtue, rendered him the joy of the people, and gave him an unrivalled a&s;cen|dancy in our armies through an eight years war. From this height of dictatorial power, equal|ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the unbounded confidence of &s;oldiers and citizens; having accompli&s;hed the ob|ject of his appointment, and the wi&s;hes of his heart, he returns to the common rank of citizen|&s;hip; retiring to the peaceful &s;hades of Vernon, without pen&s;ion or emolument to him&s;elf or fami|ly, and without other reward for his long, pain|ful and important &s;ervices, than the affectionate glowing hearts of his countrymen, and the admi|ration of the world. How unlike a Cae&s;ar or a Cromwell, or the heroes of antiquity! When <HI>they</HI> had acquired or u&s;urped the &s;overeign power, the reins of government were guided to aggran|dize them&s;elves at the expence of their country's liberties. It was re&s;erved to this fir&s;t of men, with di&s;intere&s;ted zeal for his country's welfare, to &s;ecure her freedom, and then to retire to enjoy, in common with his fellow-citizens, the ble&s;&s;ings he had procured with &s;o much toil and danger.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037487_0008_100D1ADD58A53058">
HAD his life terminated with our revolution|ary war, what American heart would not have lamented his departure? He &s;tood unrivalled in human glory and greatne&s;s;&mdash;but Heaven, as if determined to &s;hew to po&s;terity the &s;ublime&s;t vir|tues of human nature, pre&s;erves his important life until the exigencies of public affairs require the aid of his other talents and virtues. The &s;tate&s;man and civil ruler remain to be di&s;played. Although our foreign enemies are driven from our favoured land, and the dove with the olive-branch of peace &s;ettles upon the bo&s;om of our country; yet, without order and government, peace cannot long be maintained; like a ve&s;&s;el de&s;titute of rudder and compa&s;s, &s;he lies expo&s;ed to the fury of every wave. Alike great in war and peace, this man of the people again &s;teps forth, and pre&s;ides in the formation of our excel|lent con&s;titution. Called by the unanimous voice of his country, he relinqui&s;hes his beloved retreat, and guides the helm of government. At this critical moment, his con&s;ummate pru|dence, inflexible firmne&s;s and endearing modera|tion, &s;ecured his country from the machinations of de&s;igning internal enemies, and the horrors of civil war. Under the au&s;pices of his mo&s;t excellent admini&s;tration, we repo&s;ed in peace un|der our "vines and fig-trees." The paternal ad|vice he gave us on his voluntary retirement from
<PB N="10" REF="037487_0009_100D1AE1309C5600">
this exalted &s;tation, his country being in a pro&s;per|ous condition, I hope is indelibly engraven on the tablets of all our hearts, and will be faithfully tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, as the be&s;t of earthly le|gacies.</P>
<P>HIS acceptance of the command of the armies of the United States, on a recent apprehen&s;ion of his country's danger, from the ho&s;tile aggre&s;&s;ions of a great and ambitious nation, enhances our ob|ligations of gratitude, and more e&s;pecially as he was in the decline of life. Yet &s;uch was the energy of his mind, and ardour for public u&s;eful|ne&s;s, that he was yet ready once more to for&s;ake the mo&s;t endearing dome&s;tic enjoyments, when his country demanded the &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>WHILE we contemplate &s;uch heroic virtue in this ever faithful leader and friend to his coun|try, we are con&s;trained to admire and to applaud;&mdash;to rejoice in &s;uch a noble &s;ample of the &s;ublime virtues to which our fallen nature may be re|&s;tored in this life. But the in&s;tance is &s;ingular, nor can the annals of hi&s;tory furni&s;h a parallel.</P>
<P>IF we believe that GOD rai&s;ed up, girded and went before Cyrus, to deliver I&s;rael from their oppre&s;&s;ors, why are we not to believe that this far more meritorious character has been, by an
<PB N="11" REF="037487_0010_100D1AE2B6251D50">
e&s;pecial and particular Providence, rai&s;ed up to deliver and to &s;ecure the people of this land?</P>
<P>BUT what avails our weak e&s;&s;ay? Has not the trumpet of fame long &s;ince circulated through the nations of Europe the atchievements and virtues of this <HI>hero</HI> and <HI>patriot?</HI> But, my fel|low mourners, we have this day to lament that the <HI>"Crown is fallen from our head."</HI> "How are the mighty fallen!" And we may &s;ay, with greater empha&s;is than David &s;aid of Abner, <HI>"Know ye not that a Prince and a great man is fallen?"</HI> Yes, Americans, your crown, your friend, the friend of man, the father of his country, the guardian of your rights, &s;leeps in du&s;t. How incalculable the lo&s;s! No more will he lead our arms to victory and peace&mdash;no more &s;hall he hear our call on the greate&s;t pub|lic exigencies&mdash;no more &s;hall he add dignity to order and government by his illu&s;trious exam|ples&mdash;no more &s;alutary coun&s;els &s;hall flow to us from his lips, now &s;ealed up in death. <HI>"The joy of our heart has cea&s;ed."</HI> I proceed to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>II. The effects this lo&s;s has produced in our country.&mdash;It always has been cu&s;tomary, in days of great public calamities, to indulge public ex|pre&s;&s;ions of grief. Who can forbear, upon an oc|ca&s;ion like the pre&s;ent, to mingle their &s;orrowful notes with the millions who&s;e "joy has cea&s;ed,"
<PB N="12" REF="037487_0011_100D1AE442BE6868">
and who&s;e &s;ong of melody is turned into mourn|ing? Why this &s;olemn appearance in the hou&s;e of prayer? Why the&s;e uncommon en&s;igns of mourn|ing which meet our eyes and damp our joys in the hou&s;e of GOD?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>On this melancholy occa&s;ion, the meeting-hou&s;e exhibited &s;uch affecting te&s;timonies of affliction, as were highy calculated to impre&s;s the mind with &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s and &s;olemn veneration. The pulpit was entirely covered with black, with the addition of a mourning-piece in front, repre&s;enting a pede&s;tal and urn, with three angels over it, as guarding the <HI>riche&s;t du&s;t</HI> of America; the pede&s;tal in&s;cribed with this motto: <HI>"Sacred to the Memory of</HI> WASHINGTON;" under it the following lines:
<Q><L><HI>Glory with all her lamps &s;hall burn,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And watch the Warrior's &s;leeping clay,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Till the la&s;t trumpet rou&s;e his urn,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To aid the triumphs of the day.</HI></L></Q></P></NOTE> We may well lament a friend to virtue fallen. Let not the reproachful com|plaint be repeated in our ears, which the Lord made by the Prophet, "The righteous peri&s;heth, and no man layeth it to heart." The melancholy tidings produced a general &s;hock pervading the nation, and the &s;orrow &s;tands depicted on every countenance, which &s;hews that the joy of the heart has cea&s;ed: from every part of our coun|try the &s;ad echo finds the nation in tears.</P>
<P>THE badges of mourning exhibited among all ranks and ages of citizens, &s;trikingly pourtray the feelings of their hearts. While our &s;orrow is ex|pre&s;&s;ed in national groans, what heart intere&s;ted in human affairs can be indifferent? Weep, then,
<PB N="13" REF="037487_0012_100D1AE8EC259AF0">
my friends; ye do well to weep with your coun|try, with the world. And while we drop our tears over his precious du&s;t, and bewail this pub|lic bereavement, we join in the general lament|ations of all that is human. Mourn, then, ye vet|erans, who&s;e heads have been &s;hielded in the day of battle, for your beloved leader! Mourn, ye young and ri&s;ing generation, for you have lo&s;t a faithful friend and coun&s;ellor! Mourn, ye friends of liberty and ju&s;tice, for our crown is fallen! Mourn, ye friends of the arts and &s;ci|ences, your patron is removed! Let the world mourn, FOR WASHINGTON IS DEAD!</P>
<P>LET us clo&s;e with &s;ome reflections and infer|ences:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. IN all the di&s;pen&s;ations of Divine Provi|dence, it becomes rational beings to contemp|late the Sovereign Di&s;po&s;er of all creatures, and make &s;uitable reflections for their own profit. And in all GOD's di&s;pen&s;ations of judgments, we may trace the emanations of his goodne&s;s, infu&s;ing &s;ome &s;alutary cordial into the mo&s;t bitter draught. This &s;entiment is &s;trikingly exemplified in the pre&s;ent melancholy in&s;tance. It has been a &s;in|gular ble&s;&s;ing, that GOD &s;hould rai&s;e up &s;uch a wonderful character, at &s;uch a very critical time
<PB N="14" REF="037487_0013_100D1AEB45CEC930">
of our nation, as a luminary to &s;hed his rays up|on us in dark and di&s;mal times.</P>
<P N="2">2d. THE pre&s;ervation of his life, which &s;eemed e&s;&s;ential to our national exi&s;tence, was no le&s;s expre&s;&s;ive of GOD'S goodne&s;s. In the name of WASHINGTON were all the ho&s;ts of America united. The &s;ecurity which all felt under his guidance, has no parallel. His name united the different parties in the nation, and reconciled them to a change in the &s;y&s;tem of government. Our mo&s;t excellent con&s;titution, under his admini&s;tration, di&s;pelled the fears of tho&s;e who were jealous of innovations.</P>
<P N="3">3d. THE example of his dignified retirement to the condition of a private citizen, cultivating tho&s;e peaceful employments which give &s;trength to the government, and happine&s;s to the govern|ed, is worthy imitation. He has taught this le&s;&s;on, that happine&s;s does not con&s;i&s;t more in leading armies, or filling a pre&s;idential chair, than in fill|ing the duties of our &s;everal &s;tations with indu&s;|try, probity, honour and virtue. Indeed we cannot turn our eyes upon this fir&s;t of men, but our hearts are filled with veneration, and warm|ed with the flame of &s;incere and filial love. How|ever fondly we may wi&s;h that talents and virtues like the&s;e might be continued upon earth, heaven
<PB N="15" REF="037487_0014_100D1AECC98CBF78">
has otherwi&s;e ordained, to &s;hew us that "all fle&s;h is gra&s;s, and all the goodline&s;s thereof as the gra&s;s which peri&s;heth."</P>
<P>WE &s;hall now infer,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. IF death has entered Vernon's &s;hade, and taken the great, the good, and wi&s;e, who can expect to e&s;cape? If temperance, that be&s;t pre&s;er|vative of health and life; if the collected virtues of the Man, the General and the Pre&s;ident, could have &s;ecured an earthly immortality, never, O lamented WASHINGTON, never &s;hould thy fall have added fre&s;h honours to the trophies of death! But &s;ince he is no more, let the great and the mighty of the earth prepare to die like men. Let us be wi&s;e, and con&s;ider our latter end, when the alarm of mortality is &s;ounded from &s;uch an elevated height;&mdash;and he who lived for our benefit, may then die for our benefit too&mdash;to remind us that we al&s;o mu&s;t die.</P>
<P>DEATH, &s;weeps off our fellow-citizens every year, every day. Our neighbours, like leaves in the autumn, drop into the grave in a thick &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion. The air, the earth, the ocean, and all the elements, are armed with death. A thou&s;and dangers lie in ambu&s;h for us. The principles of mortality lurk in our own con&s;titutions; and &s;ick|ne&s;s,
<PB N="16" REF="037487_0015_100D1AEE4EFB6360">
the herald of the la&s;t enemy, often warns us to prepare. Yet how few realize the thought, that they mu&s;t die! How many forget this &s;olemn &s;ub|ject, till they feel it! They &s;tand fearle&s;s and un|apprehen&s;ive upon the &s;lippery brink of eternity, till they unexpectedly fall, and are ingulphed in the boundle&s;s ocean. But &s;hall not this loud alarm awaken us out of our vain dreams of an earthly immortality? When the mighty is "fal|len," &s;hall not the feeble tremble? If the father of a people mu&s;t cea&s;e to live, &s;hall not the peo|ple expect to die? If common deaths are &s;o fre|quent that they have lo&s;t their monitory force, &s;hall not the death of this mighty man con&s;train us to realize our own mortality? Shall it not awaken that univer&s;al &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s which that pro&s;|pect in&s;pires? How great a ble&s;&s;ing might this awful di&s;pen&s;ation prove, if thus religiou&s;ly im|proved?</P>
<P N="2">2d. AMERICANS have been indulged with a living example of &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed and rare virtues; are they not bound to improve it, by copying tho&s;e parts of it within their particular &s;pheres of action? Let not the exalted height de|ter us from the attempt. The more fair, beau|tiful and perfect the original, the more refined the plea&s;ure we &s;hall have in the imitation. It is not expected that we &s;hould all be generals,
<PB N="17" REF="037487_0016_100D1AF22590F568">
pre&s;idents or rulers; but we &s;hould all be good citizens&mdash;peaceable, indu&s;trious, virtuous and faithful, in our &s;everal &s;tations; "rendering to Cae&s;ar the things that are Cae&s;ar's, and unto God the things that are God's." Do we venerate the character of the decea&s;ed? Let us give evi|dence of our veneration, by imbibing his &s;pirit, trea&s;uring up his advice in our bo&s;oms, and tran&s;|mitting the &s;ame to po&s;terity, that our children may learn to li&s;p that beloved name, and look up to him as a model for their imitation. Let us cheri&s;h his philanthropic &s;entiments&mdash;let us copy his example of humanity, and convince the world, that Americans have caught the "mantle" of our departed FATHER and BENE|FACTOR.</P>
<P N="3">3d. IF all that is great in human nature is but mortal&mdash;if <HI>"the joy of our heart is cea&s;ed,"</HI> it becomes a rational immortal being to &s;eek per|manent, unchanging good. Where &s;hall it be found? only in the Supreme Good. Let us then lay up for our&s;elves "trea&s;ures in heaven," and be rich towards God. There is one gift of heaven to mankind, which &s;hall &s;urvive the di&s;&s;olution of the world, which &s;hall flouri&s;h and reign fore|ver; I mean religion. Yes, the divine religion of our adorable Saviour, who conquered death when he died, who has opened the portals of eternal glo|ry,
<PB N="18" REF="037487_0017_100D1AF4705D7C28">
"and holds the keys of death and the grave;" who openeth, and no man &s;hutteth; who &s;hutteth, and no man openeth. This religion will &s;hine bright in the night of affliction&mdash;will irradiate the thick glooms of death, and blaze out into immortality. This will be a &s;ource of happine&s;s through the revolutions of eternal ages; what in|conceivable comfort does our religion di&s;clo&s;e to the believing eye! It guides the pilgrim in the hou&s;e and pri&s;on of his clay; it points cut the road to duty and happine&s;s; it &s;oothes the mourner in the deep angui&s;h of &s;orrow, when his earthly <HI>"crown is fallen,"</HI> and <HI>"the joy of his heart cea&s;ed."</HI> When the "king of terrors" knocks at the door of the pious, he may bid him welcome; for, with a well grounded hope of eternal life by JESUS CHRIST, he can &s;ing, "Oh death, where is thy &s;ting? Oh grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be unto God, who giveth us the victory, through our Lord JESUS CHRIST." Yes, this re|ligion unfolds the my&s;tery of a re&s;urrection; that the precious du&s;t of the righteous has the guard of Omnipotence, and the deep &s;ounding trump of God &s;hall finally bring forth the &s;acred de|po&s;ite. Then &s;hall corruption put on incorrup|tion, and the vile bodies of his &s;ervants "be fa&s;hioned like unto the glorious body of our Lord JESUS CHRIST."</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="037487_0018_100D1AF5F652E028">
Now we may a&s;k, in the language of an ele|gant writer, "Is this &s;en&s;ele&s;s du&s;t all that is left of this greate&s;t of men? Has he &s;uffered a total extinction of being? Is he dead to him&s;elf, to the univer&s;e, and to his God? No, he lives! he greatly lives the life of immortals&mdash;he lives in the immen&s;e regions of &s;pirits; where all the &s;uperficial di&s;tinctions of birth, riches, power and maje&s;ty, are lo&s;t forever; and all the di&s;tinc|tion that remains, ari&s;es from virtue and vice; from our having acted our part well or ill in the &s;tation where we are fixed. There triumphant tyranny, that bade defiance to human power, is bla&s;ted and degraded by the frown of Omnipo|tence: and there tho&s;e rulers of men, who were the &s;ervants of God, are advanced to a higher &s;phere of dominion and beneficence, and the badges of earthly greatne&s;s are &s;uperfluous to their dignity, and would but conceal their worth;" "for they are made kings and prie&s;ts unto God forever." There they are clothed with the robes of &s;alvation, and the garments of prai&s;e: and wear crowns of unfading glory, infinitely brighter than tho&s;e which the gold, and gems, and glitter|ing trifles of the earth, can compo&s;e.</P>
