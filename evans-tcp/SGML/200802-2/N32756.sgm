<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following pages contain an an&s;wer to one of the mo&s;t artful, in&s;idious and per|nicious pamphlets I have ever met with. It is ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the pa&s;&s;ions of the populace, at a time when their pa&s;&s;ions are much inflamed. At &s;uch junctures, cool rea&s;on and judgment are too apt to &s;leep: The mind is ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on, and the mo&s;t violent mea&s;ures will, <HI>therefore,</HI> be thought the mo&s;t &s;alutary. Po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions will pa&s;s for de|mon&s;tration with many, rage for &s;incerity, and the mo&s;t glaring ab&s;urdities and fal&s;hoods will be &s;wallowed.</P>
<P>The author of COMMON SENSE, has availed him&s;elf of all tho&s;e advantages. Under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip to America, in the pre&s;ent calami|tous &s;ituation of affairs, he gives vent to his own private re&s;entment and ambition, and recommends a &s;cheme which mu&s;t infallibly prove ruinous. He propo&s;es that we &s;hould renounce our allegi|ance to our &s;overeign, break off all connection with Great-Britain, and &s;et up an independent empire of the republican kind. Sen&s;ible that &s;uch a propo&s;al mu&s;t, even at this time, be &s;hocking to the ears of Americans; he in&s;inuates that the
<PB N="iv" REF="043050_0003_101CABC94338CC70">
<HI>novelty</HI> of his &s;entiments is the only ob&s;tacle to their &s;ucce&s;s,&mdash;that, "perhaps they are not yet &s;uffici|ently fa&s;hionable to procure them general favour; that a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a &s;uperficial appearance of being right, and rai&s;es at fir&s;t a formidable outcry in defence of cu&s;tom."</P>
<P>In this he imitates all other enthu&s;ia&s;ts and vi|&s;ionary of paradoxes, who were con&s;ci|ous that the common feelings of mankind mu&s;t revolt again&s;t their &s;chemes: the author, however, tho' he did not intend it here, pays a compliment to the Americans; for this amounts to a confe&s;|&s;ion, that amid&s;t all their grievances, they &s;till retain their allegiance and loyalty.</P>
<P>With the &s;ame view, I pre&s;ume, to make his pamphlet go down the better, he prefixes the title of Common Sen&s;e to it&mdash;by a figure in rhetoric, which is called a <HI>Catachre&s;is,</HI> that is, in plain En|gli&s;h, an abu&s;e of words. Under this title, he counteracts the cleare&s;t dictates of rea&s;on, truth, and common &s;en&s;e. Thus have I &s;een a book written by a popi&s;h bigot, entitled, <HI>Mercy and Truth; or, Charity maintained;</HI> in which the author very devoutly and charitably damns all heretics.</P>
<P>I find no <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> in this pamphlet, but much <HI>uncommon</HI> phrenzy. It is an outrageous in|&s;ult on the common &s;en&s;e of Americans; an in&s;i|dious attempt to poi&s;on their minds, and &s;educe them from their loyalty and true&s;t intere&s;t. The principles of government laid down in it, are not only fal&s;e, but &s;uch as &s;carcely ever entered the head of a crazy politician. Even Hobbes would blu&s;h to own the author for a di&s;ciple. He unites the violence of a republican with all the folly of
<PB N="v" REF="043050_0004_101CAEAA35A517E0">
a fanatic. If principles of truth and common &s;en&s;e, however, would not &s;erve his &s;cheme, he could not help that by any other method than by inventing &s;uch as <HI>would;</HI> and this he has done.</P>
<P>No per&s;on breathing, has a deeper &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es of America, than I have&mdash;or would rejoice more to &s;ee them removed, and our liberties &s;ettled on a permanent, con&s;titutional foundation. But this author's propo&s;al, in&s;tead of removing our grievances, would aggravate them a thou&s;and fold. The remedy is infinitely wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e. It would be like cutting off a leg, becau&s;e a toe happened to ache.</P>
<P>It is probable that this pamphlet, like others, will &s;oon &s;ink in oblivion&mdash;that the de&s;tructive plan it holds out, will &s;peedily be forgotten, and vani&s;h, like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion; yet while any hone&s;t man is in danger of being &s;e|duced by it&mdash;whil&s;t there is even a po&s;&s;ibility that the dreadful evils it is calculated to produce, &s;hould overtake us; I think it a duty which I owe to God, to my King and country, to counteract, in this manner, the poi&s;on it contains. Nor do I think it le&s;s a duty thus to vindicate our honour|able Congre&s;s, and my injured countrymen in general, from the duplicity and criminal in&s;ince|rity with which this pamphlet virtually charges them.</P>
<P>The reader however mu&s;t not expect that I &s;hould &s;ubmit to the drudgery of returning a di|&s;tinct an&s;wer to every part of a pamphlet, in which the lines in many places are out numbered by the fal&s;hoods; and where the author's malice and antipathy to monarchical government, mi&s;repre|&s;ent almo&s;t every thing relative to the &s;ubject I
<PB N="vi" REF="043050_0005_101CAEAF0AC6ED28">
have done, notwith&s;tanding what I conceive to be &s;ufficient&mdash;I have developed his leading prin|ciples, and obviated &s;uch mi&s;repre&s;entations as are apti&s;t to mi&s;lead the unwary. I have, moreover, &s;hewn that his &s;cheme is big with ruin to Ameri|ca&mdash;that it is contrary to the &s;entiments of the coloni&s;ts, and that in a reconciliation with Great-Britain, on &s;olid, con&s;titutional principles, ex|cluding all parliamentary taxation, the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of this continent, are only to be &s;ought or found.</P>
<P>I neither have, nor can po&s;&s;ibly have any in|tere&s;ts &s;eparate from tho&s;e of America&mdash;any ob|ject in view but her welfare. My fate is involved in her's. If &s;he becomes a conquered country, or an independent republic, I can promi&s;e my&s;elf no advantage or emolument in either ca&s;e; but mu&s;t inevitably &s;hare with millions in the evils that will en&s;ue. This I can declare, before the &s;earcher of hearts, is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Can the author of Common Sen&s;e do the &s;ame? Can he truely and &s;incerely &s;ay, that he has no honour, power, or profit in view, &s;hould his darling republican &s;cheme take place? If not, than he is an intere&s;t|ed, prejudiced per&s;on, and very unfit to advi&s;e in this matter. We &s;hould be di&s;tru&s;tful of his judgment, and on our guard again&s;t what he re|commends.</P>
<P>The author calls him&s;elf an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> but whether he is a native of <HI>Old England,</HI> or <HI>New England,</HI> is a thing I neither know nor care about. I am only to know him by the features he hath there exhibited of him&s;elf, which are tho&s;e of an avowed, violent Republican, utterly aver&s;e and
<PB N="vii" REF="043050_0006_101CAEB0C5F96B40">
unfriendly to the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. He hath not prefixed his name to his pamphlet; neither &s;hall I prefix mine to this. But as I fear his abili|ties ju&s;t as little as I love his republican cau&s;e, I hereby pledge my&s;elf, that in ca&s;e he &s;hould re|ply, and publi&s;h his name; I al&s;o, &s;hould I think it nece&s;&s;ary to rejoin, &s;hall publi&s;h my name. I ho|nour genius wherever I meet with it; but dete&s;t its pro&s;titution to bad purpo&s;es. The few faint glimmerings of it that are thinly &s;cattered throw this pamphlet, are but a poor compen&s;ation for its malevolent, pernicious de&s;ign; and &s;erve only to rai&s;e our indignation and abhorrence.</P>
<P>I hope the reader will di&s;tingui&s;h where there is a real difference between this Republican's cau&s;e, and that of America. If not, and if he is not willing to li&s;ten calmly to truth, I advi&s;e him to &s;top here and lay down this pamphlet. But if the ca&s;e be otherwi&s;e, I have only to be&s;eech him, whil&s;t peru&s;ing this treati&s;e, to remember that it was written to promote our reconciliation with a King and nation, whom, not long &s;ince, we &s;in|cerely loved and e&s;teemed. The bittere&s;t enmity I know is that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between tho&s;e who were once friends, but have fallen out. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, and whil&s;t our re&s;entment is high, the advice which tends to gratify that re&s;entment, may be the mo&s;t welcome. But when our pa&s;|&s;ions &s;ub&s;ide, our former affections will al&s;o re|turn; and we &s;hall then look upon him to be much more our friend who would calm our re&s;entment, than him who would inflame it. From our for|mer connection with Great Britain, we have al|ready derived numberle&s;s advantages and benefits; from a clo&s;er union with her, on proper principles,
<PB N="viii" REF="043050_0007_101CAEB44BEE0808">
we may derive &s;till greater benefits in future. Duty, gratitude, intere&s;t, nay, Providence, by its all-wi&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations, loudly call on both coun|tries to unite, and would join them together; and may infamy be the portion of that wretch who would put them a&s;under.</P>

<HEAD>ANSWER TO SECTION I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Origin and De&s;ign of Government in general; with conci&s;e Remarks on the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution.</HEAD>
<P>WRITERS on politics, like tho&s;e on philo|&s;ophy, are very apt to be warped by prejudice, and the &s;y&s;tems they have previou&s;ly adopted. They often draw general conclu&s;ions from particular premi&s;es, and form their judg|ment of human nature, not from a general view of mankind in their various &s;ituations; but from the conduct of a few individuals, and the parti|cular &s;tate of things at the time they wrote. Whil&s;t &s;ome of them pretend to delineate the true &s;tate of human nature, perhaps they only give us a di&s;gu&s;ting picture of their own dark and gloomy minds. Moreover, tho&s;e writers are charged with founding their principles, not on nature and fact, but on their own prejudices, on improbable &s;uppo&s;itions and imaginary ca&s;es, which never had an exi&s;tance. Hence that varie|ty of vi&s;ionary political fabricks that have been
<PB N="10" REF="043050_0009_101CAEBD0F621C40">
rai&s;ed, contradictory to each other, and repug|nant to common &s;en&s;e, and which will not bear the te&s;t of &s;ober examination. Some of them indeed may do very well on paper, but can never be reduced to practice, unle&s;s a race of beings, very different from men, can be found for the pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t writers of this &s;ort amu&s;e them&s;elves with Utopian &s;y&s;tems, and go no further, they may be borne with, and pa&s;s without much cen|&s;ure. Their works may be read like other ro|mances, or fictions. But if they pre&s;ume to loo&s;e the bands of &s;ociety, and overturn governments that have been formed by the wi&s;dom of ages, to make way for their own crude &s;y&s;tems, and there|by entail mi&s;ery and ruin upon millions; it is then ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to examine tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems, point out their de&s;tructive tendency, and unma&s;k the deceivers that propo&s;e them.</P>
<P>The author of a pamphlet, fal&s;ly and ab&s;urdly entitled COMMON SENSE, is not only chargeable with a large portion of the above defects, in com|mon with other political &s;y&s;tem-makers, but al&s;o with the further de&s;ign of rending the Briti&s;h em|pire a&s;under. To realize his beloved &s;cheme of independent republicani&s;m, he would per&s;uade the coloni&s;ts to renounce their allegiance to our true and lawful liege &s;overeign King GEORGE III. plunge them&s;elves into a tedious, bloody, and mo&s;t expen&s;ive war with Great-Britain, and ri&s;que their lives, liberties and property on the dubious event of that war.</P>
<P>This is the principal object his pamphlet has in view; other things are only mentioned as condu|cive to that end. To prepare the reader for it&mdash;
<PB N="11" REF="043050_0010_101CAEBEA02222A0">
to take off that horror which every hone&s;t man and well-informed friend of America mu&s;t natu|rally feel at a propo&s;al &s;o wicked and ruinous; he fir&s;t treats of &s;ome other matters which he fa&s;hions to his purpo&s;e; he poi&s;ons the fountain that the &s;tream may be avoided: With this de&s;ign, he de|livers his &s;entiments on government, the Engli&s;h con&s;titution and monarchy. I &s;hall now very briefly examine what he has offered on the&s;e &s;ub|jects.</P>
<P>He tells us, that "&s;ome writers have confound|ed &s;ociety with government;" and then &s;upplies us with a di&s;tinction which is to &s;et all right. He &s;ays, "Society is produced by our wants, and govern|ment by our wickedne&s;s." We may rea&s;onably pre&s;ume there are neither wants nor wickedne&s;s in Heaven. According to this doctrine then, there can be no &s;ociety or government there; and yet we are a&s;&s;ured of the contrary.</P>
<P>This di&s;tinction is not only inaccurate, but it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> al&s;o founded on fal&s;e principles; and we might expect the rever&s;e of both, when the errors of others are profe&s;&s;edly corrected. Our wants do not produce &s;ociety; nor are the fir&s;t or principal cau&s;e of it. Did this gentleman ever know of any one that was born out of &s;ociety? Are we not by an act of providence in our birth made members of &s;ociety? A &s;tate of &s;ociety is the na|tural &s;tate of man; and by the con&s;titution of his mind and frame he is fitted for it. Not only his wants and weakne&s;s require it, but his incli|nations, his noble&s;t faculties impel him to it; and the more perfect tho&s;e faculties are, the better is he fitted for &s;ociety. As nature has thus made us members of &s;ociety, without any choi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">,
<PB N="12" REF="043050_0011_101CAEC21F351320">
or will of ours; &s;o, whatever happine&s;s or per|fection we are capable of, can only be attained in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>This writer's account of the origin of govern|ment is equally exceptionable with that of the origin of &s;ociety. I can no more a&s;&s;ent to it than to Hobbes's notion,&mdash;"that mankind are naturally in a &s;tate of war, and that government is founded in &s;uperior power or force."</P>
<P>Since providence hath formed us for &s;ociety, and placed us in it from the time of our fir&s;t ex|i&s;tance, I am of Hooker's opinion,&mdash;"that &s;o|ciety could not be without government, nor go|vernment without law," tho' mankind were ever &s;o virtuous. For what is government, but the regulation of &s;ociety by laws? It is well known to all who are conver&s;ant in hi&s;tory, that the dif|ferent &s;tates, the different forms of government which have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the world, have had their origin from a variety of cau&s;es peculiar to each. Of the&s;e I &s;peak not, but of government in ge|neral, herein following my republican guide.</P>
<P>As we cannot doubt but the benevolent author of our being, wills our happine&s;s in the &s;tate where he hath placed us, he &s;urely wills al&s;o the means which lead to that end&mdash;tho&s;e means are order and government. Thus far I hold with the be&s;t republican writers on this &s;ubject, the divine right of government, who&s;e end is the good of man|kind; yet without appropriating that right to any particular form, exclu&s;ively of others. Were men as virtuous as angels, yet, if collected in large &s;ocieties, there mu&s;t be a variety of &s;tates and conditions among them; and wherever &s;uch &s;ocieties are, government will be indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="043050_0012_101CAEC574F31D60">
But not to enter deeply into this &s;ubject, which would be foreign to my de&s;ign, I &s;hall ju&s;t ob|&s;erve, that man is a moral agent, and thereby fit|ted to be governed by laws:&mdash;He is born in &s;o|ciety, who&s;e ends cannot be obtained, but by &s;ubordination, order and the regulation of laws; and where the&s;e are, there is government. I conclude, therefore, that government is agreeable to the will of the Deity&mdash;that it has its origin in the nature and &s;tate of man&mdash;that in framing go|vernments by mutual compact, men act ac|cording to the law of their nature, and dictates of rea&s;on, which thus point out the only effectual way to attain happine&s;s and avoid evil. I draw my principles from nature and fact, without having recour&s;e to &s;y&s;tem&mdash;the never failing re|fuge of weak minds, and of party writers.</P>
<P>Agreeably to the origin he a&s;&s;igns to govern|ment, our author &s;eems to think the only bu&s;ine&s;s of government is to <HI>puni&s;h;</HI> for, he &s;ays, that as &s;ociety is a "patron," &s;o government is "a pu|ni&s;her." But to think thus, betrays an equal ig|norance of the principles of government, and of matter of fact. Numberle&s;s ble&s;&s;ings &s;low from government be&s;ides the &s;ecurity re&s;ulting from a re&s;traint of vice by puni&s;hing the vicious. Were there no wickedne&s;s, there would probably be little occa&s;ion for penal laws; but are the&s;e the only laws enacted by government? The criminal law of any &s;tate makes but a &s;mall part of its general code. It is Livy, I think, who &s;ome where defines government to be, "The empire of laws, and not of men." According to this definition, the laws of our author's government, <HI>produced by wickedne&s;s,</HI> would exerci&s;e a mo&s;t tyran|nical
<PB N="14" REF="043050_0013_101CAECA738E3248">
&s;way&mdash;being de&s;igned only to <HI>puni&s;h,</HI> they would probably re&s;emble the laws of Draco, which were &s;aid to be written in blood. Per&s;ons who entertain &s;uch notions of government, may be well calculated to form a &s;anguinary code of laws, and afterwards to execute them; for doubt|le&s;s they would feel very well inclined to inflict every kind of puni&s;hment without &s;cruples.</P>
<P>To evince the truth of his a&s;&s;ertion, that "Government is produced by wickedne&s;s," our author adds, "Government, like dre&s;s, is the badge of lo&s;t innocence; the palaces of Kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of Paradi&s;e." This is mighty florid&mdash;what pity that it has no &s;olidity! Ju&s;t &s;o, &s;ay I. Ploughing and &s;owing, like dre&s;s, are the badges of lo&s;t innocence: The farmer's cottage, barn, &s;table, and hog-hou&s;e are built upon the ruins of the bowers of Paradi&s;e. I cannot &s;ee that this <HI>pretty</HI> &s;entence proves any thing but the author's enmity to kings and mo|narchical governments: For if he would hereby &s;hew the inexpediency of either, the &s;ame argu|ment will equally &s;hew the inexpediency of ploughing and &s;owing, of the former's cottage, barn, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Having thus laid his foundation, the author proceeds to erect his &s;uper&s;tructure; and I a&s;&s;ure you, gentle reader, the one is perfectly &s;uitable to the other. "In order to gain a clear and ju&s;t idea of the de&s;ign and end of government," &s;ays he, "let us &s;uppo&s;e a &s;mall number of per&s;ons &s;ettled in &s;ome &s;eque&s;tered part of the earth, un|connected with the re&s;t; they will repre&s;ent the fir&s;t peopling of any country, or of the world. In this &s;tate of natural liberty,"&mdash;well! what
<PB N="15" REF="043050_0014_101CAECC0C41D140">
would they fir&s;t do or think of? Why,&mdash;"&s;ociety will be their fir&s;t thought!" This indeed might po&s;&s;ibly happen, were we to &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e per&s;ons had dropped from the clouds, or &s;prung out of the earth, and could all &s;peak the &s;ame language. On any other principle, the ca&s;e here &s;tated is utterly devoid of probability.</P>
<P>The author in this, follows the example of &s;ome other manufacturers of political &s;y&s;tems, who fly to fiction, when matters of fact &s;hould be re|lated: But as he has managed things, his fiction is contradictory and replete with ab&s;urdity, For he &s;uppo&s;es that tho&s;e per&s;ons, "&s;ettled in &s;ome &s;eque&s;tered part of the earth," had emigrated&mdash;"that the fir&s;t difficulties of emigration had bound them together;" and yet gravely tells us, "their fir&s;t thought," when &s;ettled, "would be &s;ociety!" I opine this thought would &s;trike them, and had been practi&s;ed long before.</P>
<P>But further, Amid&s;t "a thou&s;and motives that would excite them thereto," i. e. &s;ociety, "one" among others, he &s;ays, would be that&mdash;"di&s;ea&s;e, nay even misfortune would be death; for altho' neither might be mortal, yet either would di&s;able any individual from living, and re|duce him to a &s;tate in which he might rather be &s;aid to peri&s;h than to die." Here, "di&s;ea&s;e, nay even misfortune" would be "death;" yet neither be "mortal," yet &s;till either would "di&s;able from living;" but this would only be "peri&s;hing" and not "dying!" I here give the author's own words&mdash;I did not make the&s;e contradictions and blunders, but found them.</P>

&s;o far from "repre&s;enting the fir&s;t peopling of any country," that I &s;incerely believe it repre&s;ents the fir&s;t peopling of no one country &s;ince the days of Adam; at lea&s;t my memory does not furni&s;h me with one parallel in&s;tance at pre&s;ent; and &s;ome parts of his &s;cheme are de&s;titute even of the fainte&s;t probability. It is very likely however, that he had the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the&s;e Briti&s;h colonies in view, while thus helping us "to gain a clear and ju&s;t idea of the de&s;ign and end of go|vernment." Many circum&s;tances favour this &s;up|po&s;ition; but there is not the lea&s;t re&s;emblance between them. The fir&s;t Briti&s;h emigrants to America, were in a &s;tate of Society before their emigration;&mdash;in England they jointly applied for grants of land here&mdash;they received grants, char|ters and in&s;tructions, which ve&s;ted them with a legal title to tho&s;e lands, and marked the outlines of tho&s;e governments that were to be formed here. When tho&s;e emigrants found them&s;elves in America, they did not then fir&s;t think of &s;o|ciety; for they were in a &s;tate of &s;ociety before, and the governments they erected here, were con|formable to the plans they had previou&s;ly received in England.</P>
<P>After fini&s;hing this goodly political edifice, the author is plea&s;ed to be&s;tow &s;ome "remarks on the &s;o much boa&s;ted con&s;titution of England." He a&s;&s;ures us&mdash;"he draws his idea of the form of government from a principle in nature which no art can overturn, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the more &s;imple any thing is, the le&s;s liable it is to be di&s;ordered, and the ea&s;ier repaired when di&s;ordered; and with this maxim in view, he offers his remarks." But he in&s;tantly forgets this promi&s;e, and pays no re|gard
<PB N="17" REF="043050_0016_101CAED2C7D71098">
to this maxim. Ab&s;olute monarchy is, pa&s;t all doubt, the &s;imple&s;t form of government; yet this gentleman prefers democracy, which is in|finitely more complex, and the mo&s;t liable to di&s;|orders of any. The truth is, that this principle was u&s;hered in, purely to contra&s;t it with the com|plex nature of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, and there|by prejudice the reader again&s;t the latter. Let me add, that if, as he him&s;elf declares, "we are never in a proper condition of doing ju&s;tice to others, while we continue under the influence of &s;ome leading partiality;" this partial, avowed republican is one of the unfitte&s;t per&s;ons breathing to offer remarks on the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. He cannot hold the &s;cales of ju&s;tice with an even hand.</P>
<P>"That the con&s;titution of England was noble," &s;ays he, "for the dark and &s;lavi&s;h times in which it was erected, is granted." This is conde&s;cend|ing&mdash;it would be more &s;o, had he informed us what "dark and &s;lavi&s;h times" he refers to. The con&s;titution of England, as it now &s;tands was fixed at the revolution, in 1688&mdash;an aera ever memorable in the fair annals of liberty. It was then that the limits of royal prerogative on the one hand, and the liberties and privileges of the &s;ubject, on the other; were a&s;certained with preci&s;ion. But certainly that was neither a "dark nor &s;lavi&s;h time." It would not be worth while to contend with a man that could a&s;&s;ert it. The lamp of &s;cience never &s;hone brighter in any country than in Britain, nor did patriots of greater &s;ame ever adorn the cau&s;e of freedom&punc; than tho&s;e who &s;tood forth to a&s;&s;ert her liberties, at that di&s;tingui&s;hed period. If our author means
<PB N="18" REF="043050_0017_101CAED7CD281A60">
any time before that, it is impertinent to the pur|po&s;e, nor am I concerned about it. What is it to us, what the con&s;titution of England was two or three hundred or a thou&s;and years ago? That con&s;titution, as fixed at the revolution, as it <HI>now</HI> &s;tands, is what we are intere&s;ted in.</P>
<P>"But that it is imperfect," he continues, "&s;ubject to convul&s;ions, and incapable of pro|ducing what it &s;eems to promi&s;e, is ea&s;ily demon|&s;trated." If he will be plea&s;ed to inform me of any political con&s;titution, of human contrivance, that was or is perfect, and not &s;ubject to convul|&s;ions, I &s;hall be obliged to him, and readily give it the preference to that of England. But until he, or &s;ome other per&s;on does &s;o, I &s;hall conti|nue in my pre&s;ent firm belief, that the con&s;tituti|on of England approaches the neare&s;t to perfec|tion&mdash;that it is productive of the greate&s;t hap|pine&s;s and benefit to the &s;ubject, of any con&s;titu|tion on earth. Nor &s;hall I he&s;itate to prefer it, in the&s;e re&s;pects, to any con&s;titution that antiquity can boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>"But the con&s;titution of England is &s;o exceed|ingly complex, that the nation may &s;uffer for years together, without being able to di&s;cover in which part the fault lies." The&s;e are matters that fall not within my line&mdash;I leave them to &s;uch profound, eagle-eyed politicians as our au|thor. One thing is certain, that if any man is aggrieved, either in his per&s;on or property, he mu&s;t &s;oon know it; and in either ca&s;e he has a &s;peedy remedy by the con&s;titution of England. The late legal deci&s;ion in favour of Mr. Wilkes, (no favourite of the court or mini&s;try)&mdash;re&s;pecting general warrants, evidently de|mon&s;trates
<PB N="19" REF="043050_0018_101CAED95CF4DF50">
the &s;ecurity enjoyed by a Briti&s;h &s;ub|ject, the equity and &s;uperior excellence of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. But what is the complexne&s;s of that con&s;titution to us? The con&s;titution of the colonies is very &s;imple; each being admini|&s;tred by a governor, council and a&s;&s;embly. Let our liberties, property and trade be once &s;ecured on a firm con&s;titutional bottom, and the com|plexne&s;s of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution cannot in the lea&s;t affect us.</P>
<P>Having hitherto &s;kirmi&s;hed only at a di&s;tance, our author prepares now for a nearer and more formida|ble attack on the Engli&s;h con&s;titution; &s;uch as &s;eems to threaten it with total demolition. "By ex|amining its component parts, he finds them to be the ba&s;e remains of two ancient tyrannies, com|pounded with &s;ome new republican materials. 1&s;t, The remains of monarchical tyranny in the per&s;on of the King. 2d, The remains of ari&s;to|cratical tyranny in the per&s;ons of the peers. 3d, The new republican materials, in the per&s;ons of the commons; the two former being hereditary, are independent of the people, and therefore in a con&s;titutional &s;en&s;e contribute nothing towards the freedom of the &s;tate."</P>
<P>Here are &s;everal hard words; and as &s;ome rea|ders may not well under&s;tand them, I &s;hall beg leave to explain them. The learned reader will the more readily excu&s;e me, as this method may be&s;t elucidate the &s;ubject before us, and deve|lope this vile medley of jargon and mi&s;repre|&s;entation.</P>
<P>It is, I think, generally agreed to by all, that there is in every &s;tate, whatever its form of government may be, a &s;upreme, ab&s;olute power. The di&s;tri|bution
<PB N="20" REF="043050_0019_101CAEDC8C7C8880">
of this power, is what con&s;titutes the different forms of government; and that form is be&s;t, which mo&s;t effectually &s;ecures the greate&s;t &s;hare of happine&s;s to the whole. There are u&s;ually reckoned three forms of governments, called <HI>&s;imple,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e which are compounded of all three, or only two of the three. The fir&s;t is monarchy, when the &s;upreme power of a &s;tate is lodged in one per&s;on. When this power is placed in the hands of a few, or &s;mall num|ber of nobles, it is called an ari&s;tocracy, which is the &s;econd form of &s;imple government. The third is where the &s;overeign power is lodged in the peo|ple at large, and this is called democracy.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e forms is &s;ubject to abu&s;e, and often has been abu&s;ed. The abu&s;e of monarchy is called tyranny&mdash;The abu&s;e of ari&s;tocracy is called oligarchy&mdash;The abu&s;e of democracy is called anar|chy; though the word tyranny may be appli|ed to the abu&s;e of any of them. Our republican author applies it to the two former, even when not abu&s;ed; and through his whole pamphlet he makes no di&s;tinction between the right u&s;e and abu&s;e of a thing. If he happens to di&s;like it, as in the ca&s;e of monarchy, however re&s;trained and calculated for the benefit of the &s;ubject; it is reprobated by the gro&s;s&mdash;it is nothing but <HI>tyranny.</HI></P>
<P>It may not be improper to ob&s;erve here, that monarchical governments are be&s;t adapted to ex|ten&s;ive dominions; popular governments to a &s;mall territory. It is al&s;o worthy of ob&s;ervation, that although there have been, and &s;till are many ab&s;o|lute monarchies; yet no government was ever pure|ly ari&s;tocratical or democratical&mdash;owing probably
<PB N="21" REF="043050_0020_101CAEDE1E388AB0">
to the unavoidable evils incident to each&mdash;or to the impracticablene&s;s of forming either. This is candidly owned by Harrington, a noted repub|lican writer. "Though for di&s;cour&s;e," &s;ays he, "politicians &s;peak of pure ari&s;tocracy, and pure democracy, there is no &s;uch thing as either of the&s;e in nature or example." Algernon Sidney, another republican writer, acknowledges the &s;ame.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his works page, 132.</NOTE></P>
<P>As each of the&s;e &s;imple forms would be attend|ed with numberle&s;s inconveniences, it has been the opinion of the wi&s;e&s;t men in every age, that a proper combination of the three, con&s;titutes the be&s;t government. It is the peculiar, di&s;tingui&s;h|ing glory of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, that it is a happy mixture of the&s;e; &s;o tempered and balan|ced, that each is kept within its proper bounds, and the good of the whole thereby promoted.</P>
<P>For what is the con&s;titution&mdash;that word &s;o often u&s;ed&mdash;&s;o little under&s;tood&mdash;&s;o much per|verted? It is, as I conceive, "that a&s;&s;emblage of laws, cu&s;toms and in&s;titutions which form the general &s;y&s;tem; according to which the &s;everal powers of the &s;tate are di&s;tributed, and their re|&s;pective rights are &s;ecured to the different mem|bers of the community." By impartially exa|mining the component parts of the Engli&s;h con&s;ti|tution, it will be found that the &s;upreme power is di&s;tributed in the be&s;t manner to attain this important end, the &s;ecurity of their re&s;pective rights to all the members of the community. The&s;e parts are,&mdash;</P>
<P>I. The King; who has the executive power, and other prerogatives, which are all &s;o ordered,
<PB N="22" REF="043050_0021_101CAEE64CE61FC0">
&s;o re&s;trained within con&s;titutional limits, as to prevent their being injurious. He can take no man's money, or property of any kind, without a law pa&s;&s;ed by the other branches of the legi&s;la|ture for that purpo&s;e. He can take no man's life, before the per&s;on has had a trial, and is con|demned by his peers. He can deprive no man of his liberty, unle&s;s the per&s;on has violated the laws of the &s;tate. And this is what our candid republican calls the "ba&s;e remains of monarchical tyranny."</P>
<P>II. The Peers; who are one branch of the legi&s;lature, and in &s;ome ca&s;es have a &s;hare in the judicial power. They have other privileges al&s;o, but all circum&s;cribed &s;o as to prevent injury to others. As the&s;e are chiefly hereditary, and are ve&s;ted with large property, they are equally inde|pendent of the crown and people, and deeply intere&s;ted in the welfare of the &s;tate. Hence they form a &s;trong barrier again&s;t any encroach|ment from either of the other branches, and give &s;tability to the con&s;titution. The&s;e are what our gentle republican calls "the ba&s;e remains of ari&s;tocratical tyranny."</P>
<P>III. The Hou&s;e of Commons; the members of which are cho&s;en by the people; without who&s;e con&s;ent, no money can be levied, nor law pa&s;&s;ed to bind the &s;ubject; and who are them|&s;elves, as well as others, bound by the laws that are enacted. The&s;e are what our author calls the "new republican materials." But why new? The Hou&s;e of Commons was not fir&s;t formed at the Revolution. Its origin is hid in the remote depths of antiquity. It may be traced with cer|tainty
<PB N="23" REF="043050_0022_101CAEE7DD4FD860">
for near &s;ix hundred years back;&mdash;&s;ome, e&s;pecially republican writers, trace it much fur|ther; although it may have undergone &s;everal variations before the revolution. Calling it new, therefore, is ju&s;t of a piece with many other of our author's expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme power of the &s;tate is di&s;tributed among the&s;e three branches of the Briti&s;h legi&s;la|ture, in &s;uch a manner, that the con&s;titution has almo&s;t all the advantages of each of the three &s;imple forms of government, and &s;carcely any of their inconveniences. On pre&s;erving an equal poize in each of the&s;e branches, depends the good of the whole: No prudent man, therefore, no real friend of Briti&s;h liberty, will ever wi&s;h to &s;ee any of them pa&s;s the con&s;titutional limits; or attempt to throw power into any of them which would de&s;troy tho balance.</P>
<P>This is a plain, conci&s;e repre&s;entation of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. It is &s;ufficient to refute our Republican's mi&s;repre&s;entation of it, ju&s;t as re|lating truth, in other ca&s;es, is a &s;ufficient refuta|tion of fal&s;hood. But left he, or my reader, &s;hould think that I mean to &s;kip over any thing that has the appearance of argument, I &s;hall follow him a little further on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>"To &s;ay, that the con&s;titution of England is an union of three powers reciprocally checking each other is farcical,"&mdash;he tells us. This is a new and &s;hort method of confutation,&mdash;&s;uch in|deed as nothing can with&s;tand. How happy is it for mankind, that this acute rea&s;oner has not thought proper to employ it in &s;hewing the nul|lity of tho&s;e reciprocal duties and obligations &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting between hu&s;band and wife, parent and
<PB N="24" REF="043050_0023_101CAEE9C4D54A18">
child, ma&s;ter and &s;ervant! They mu&s;t all have infallibly vani&s;hed, and have been annihilated by a few farcical &s;trokes of his pen! Yet &s;o it hap|pens, that the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t men, the warme&s;t advocates of liberty, have viewed this reciprocal check of the three branches of the legi&s;lature, not as farcical, unmeaning or contradictory; but as the mo&s;t effectual method that human wi&s;dom could devi&s;e to promote happine&s;s and liberty.</P>
<P>Still, however, he in&s;i&s;ts,&mdash;that "to &s;ay the Commons are a check upon the King, pre&s;up|po&s;es two things. 1. That the King is not to be tru&s;ted without being looked after." I think no man &s;hould be tru&s;ted with uncontrouled power during life.&mdash;No, not even a &s;elf-denying, hum|ble Republican. "Or that a thir&s;t of ab&s;olute power is the natural di&s;ea&s;e of monarchy."&mdash;Not a jot more &s;o than of republicani&s;m. 2. That "the Commons by being appointed for that purpo&s;e, are either wi&s;er or more worthy of confidence than the King.&mdash;But as the &s;ame con|&s;titution which gives the Commons a power to check the King, gives afterwards the King a power to check the Commons; it again &s;uppo&s;es that the King is wi&s;er than tho&s;e, whom it has already &s;uppo&s;ed to be wi&s;er than him. A mere ab&s;urdity!"</P>
<P>There is, I confe&s;s, a palpable ab&s;urdity here; but it lies in our author's &s;uppo&s;itions concerning what the con&s;titution &s;uppo&s;es; not in the mutual check which the King and Commons have upon each other. Is it not highly ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that a man, becau&s;e he has a con&s;titutional check upon others, mu&s;t therefore be wi&s;er than tho&s;e others? A common con&s;table has, in many ca&s;es,
<PB N="25" REF="043050_0024_101CAEECFB0FA8D0">
a check upon his fellow-&s;ubjects; does it there|fore follow that he mu&s;t be wi&s;er, or that the con|&s;titution &s;uppo&s;es he is wi&s;er than they?</P>
<P>The remaining part of this &s;ection is &s;uch mi|&s;erable &s;tuff, that it would only be flinging away time to expo&s;e it;&mdash;it is not worthy of confuta|tion. It con&s;i&s;ts of declamation again&s;t the Eng|li&s;h con&s;titution that would di&s;grace a &s;chool-boy. Some expre&s;&s;ions, indeed, &s;uch as the&s;e, "That the Engli&s;h con&s;titution is too incomprehen&s;ible to be within the compa&s;s of de&s;cription:&mdash;that no power can be from God that needs checking;" with others of the &s;ame kind, &s;eem to flow from in&s;anity, and to be rather the effu&s;ions of a di&s;|tempered brain, than the language of a per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of common, or any other, &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this head by referring my reader to the te&s;timony of one of the be&s;t judges in &s;ubjects of this &s;ort, and the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of juri&s;prudence, that any age has produced, in favour of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution,&mdash;I mean the celebrated MONTESQUIEU. His te&s;timony will out-weigh, with the judicious, the &s;illy decla|mations of ten thou&s;and &s;uch Politica&s;ters as our republican author. The pa&s;&s;age I allude to is in Book xi. Chap. 6. <HI>Of the Spirit of Laws,</HI>&mdash;though many others of the &s;ame kind are inter&s;per&s;ed in that excellent work.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Monarchy and hereditary Succe&s;&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>COME we now to our author's ob&s;ervations on "Monarchy and hereditary Succe&s;&s;ion." The la&s;t of the&s;e I &s;hall &s;ay little about, for the following rea&s;ons. I have humility enough to think, that tho&s;e illu&s;trious patriots who &s;ettled the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown of England in the Hou&s;e of Hanover, &s;oon after the revolution, knew full as much of the matter as I do,&mdash;or as even our author knows. What they did in this re&s;pect, I believe was right, and therefore acqui|e&s;ce in it. Few, I imagine, will di&s;&s;ent from my opinion on this head, notwith&s;tanding this author's objections. In the next place, the crudities here offered concerning hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, are not new, but borrowed from other writers.&mdash;Mo&s;t of them may be found in a &s;mall treati&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Grounds and Rea&s;ons of Monarchy con&s;idered and ex|emplified in the Scotch Line, &amp;c.</HI> By JOHN HALL, <HI>of Gray's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, E&s;quire;</HI> bound with Harrington's works.</NOTE> written by one John Hall, a pen&s;ioner under Oliver Cromwell; and I have nothing to do with John Hall, but with the author of Common Sen&s;e.

But it will be proper to be&s;tow a few minutes in examining what is here alledged concerning mo|narchy in general; again&s;t which this republican mar&s;hals a formidable ho&s;t of arguments. The reader will remember, that monarchy may be either ab&s;olute; or mixed and combined with the other &s;imple forms of government. Our author makes no di&s;tinction between the&s;e; and altho' all he &s;ays, and a thou&s;and times more that might be &s;aid, were true with re&s;pect to the former; yet all this would not militate in the lea&s;t again&s;t the mild and tempered monarchy of Great-Britain. Let us, however, attend his arguments.</P>
<P>"In the early ages of the world, according to &s;cripture chronology, there were no kings; the con&s;equence of which was, there were no wars; it is the pride of kings which throws mankind into confu&s;ion. Holland without a king hath enjoyed more peace for this la&s;t century, than any of the monarchical governments in Europe." It were needle&s;s, at pre&s;ent, to determine how early kings began to reign; e&s;pecially as we find by &s;cripture chronology and &s;cripture hi&s;tory, that there was murder, violence and war,&mdash;that "the earth was filled with violence"&mdash;long enough be|fore we hear a &s;yllable about kings,&mdash;I may &s;ay, before there were any. Referring tho&s;e di&s;orders, therefore, to that origin, is unfair and untrue. Melchezidec is one of the fir&s;t kings we read of; he lived in the times of patriarchal &s;implicity, and his character is re&s;pectable, being nor only a king, but al&s;o "the prie&s;t of the mo&s;t high God." This account of kings is very different from our author's.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="043050_0027_101CAEF6D0A50C20">
The in&s;tance of Holland is injudiciou&s;ly &s;elect|ed, to &s;hew that &s;tates which have no kings, are therefore exempt from war. There has not been a general war in Europe for a century pa&s;t, in which Holland was not deeply engaged; except the very la&s;t, and this was more owing to inabi|lity than any other cau&s;e. Every page almo&s;t of the hi&s;tory of the <HI>Seven United Provinces,</HI> is a refutation of our author's a&s;&s;ertion. His in&s;inu|ation, that &s;tates which have not Kings, are ex|empt from, and not addicted to war, is equally groundle&s;s. Republics have been as much in|volved in wars as other &s;tates. The &s;everal re|publics of Greece, inli&s;ted under the banners of Sparta, on one &s;ide, or tho&s;e of Athens, on the other&mdash;both republics, waged a mo&s;t bloody war for thirty years together. And what is remarka|ble, they were plunged into this war by Pericles, a very popular Athenian, and celebrated &s;peaker; who, being impeached for embezzling the pub|lic money, and applying it to his own private u&s;e, took this terrible method to divert an enquiry. The war ended in the de&s;truction of Athens. The &s;ingle republic of Rome, made greater ha|vock of the human &s;pecies, &s;hed more blood, di&s;|fu&s;ed more wretchedne&s;s and mi&s;ery thro' the earth, and was guilty of more cruelty, oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny, than perhaps any three monarchies that can be mentioned in the whole compa&s;s of an|cient hi&s;tory. If a few &s;mall republics of mo|dern date, have more re&s;pite from war than &s;ome monarchies; it is more owing, like their very ex|i&s;tance, to their particular &s;ituations, the jea|lou&s;y of neighbouring powers, and other &s;imilar circum&s;tances, than to the nature of their govern|ment.</P>

"Government by Kings," this writer tells us, "was fir&s;t introduced by Heathens." And &s;o, &s;aw I, was Greek and Latin&mdash;&s;o was &s;moaking tobacco; and yet I can read Homer and Virgil, or enjoy my pipe, with great compo&s;ure of con|&s;cience. The fir&s;t hint of bleeding, in ca&s;es of &s;ickne&s;s, is &s;aid to have been taken from the cro|codile&mdash;of admini&s;tring cly&s;ters, from the ibis, an Egyptian bird.

If a thing is good in it&s;elf, I conceive it to be a matter of very little moment, who it was that fir&s;t introduced it. I am clearly of opi|nion al&s;o, that democracy, our author's favourite &s;cheme of government, was of heatheni&s;h origin, as well as monarchy: And &s;ince he is &s;o aver&s;e to any thing heatheni&s;h, I would beg leave to re|mind him, that fal&s;hood, deceit, and &s;peaking evil of dignities, are heatheni&s;h crimes, and ex|pre&s;sly forbidden by &s;cripture.</P>
<P>But the wor&s;t is yet to come; for "govern|ment by Kings, was the mo&s;t pro&s;perous invention the devil ever &s;et on foot for the promotion of idolatry. The heathens paid divine honours to their decea&s;ed Kings." If he was the author of this invention, for the purpo&s;e here alledged, then I aver the devil was mi&s;taken in his foreca&s;t; or el&s;e he &s;oon retained all the Heathen republics in his &s;ervice, to promote the &s;ame end. For it is a mo&s;t notorious, undeniable fact, that the an|cient republics&mdash;Rome, Carthage, Athens, &amp;c. were as infamous for every &s;pecies of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t abominable idolatry, as any monarchies
<PB N="30" REF="043050_0029_101CAEFA607F61B8">
whatever. Let the Floralia of Rome, and hu|man &s;acrifices offered at Carthage, to mention no other in&s;tances, &s;erve as proofs of this. The truth is, that idolatry had &s;pread its gloomy reign almo&s;t univer&s;ally over the Heathen world. The form of government in any &s;tate, neither promoted nor retarded it any more than the &s;hape of their &s;hields, or the form of their whi&s;kers. The pu|re&s;t &s;y&s;tem of religion, that Heathen antiquity can boa&s;t of, prevailed in Per&s;ia, where monar|chy was e&s;tabli&s;hed; the remains of which reli|gion, are &s;aid to be pre&s;erved to this day among the Gentoos of Indo&s;tan.</P>
<P>But "Heathens paid divine honours to their decea&s;ed kings." The more fools they, no doubt; however, they did the &s;ame to their decea&s;ed he|roes, and benefactors in general, whether kings or not, whether male or female. If this argu|ment, therefore, is of any force again&s;t govern|ment by kings, it is of equal force again&s;t any improvement in agriculture; again&s;t cleaning &s;tables, and killing &s;nakes; for Heathens paid divine honours to decea&s;ed per&s;ons for all tho&s;e exploits. It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to return a grave an&s;wer to &s;uch &s;ophi&s;try; e&s;pecially, when the au|thor may, perhaps, care as little for the bible, as he does for the alcoran or &s;ha&s;tah, only as it may &s;erve his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>From Heatheni&s;m, our author flies next to &s;cripture for arguments again&s;t monarchy. Were I a par&s;on, I &s;hould be better qualified to deal with him in this way. However, as I am a &s;in|cere believer in divine revelation, I &s;ometime read the &s;cripture for in&s;truction&mdash;nor am I a&s;hamed to own it&mdash;Boyle, Locke, and Newton, did the

&s;ame. I al&s;o have recour&s;e &s;ometimes to a few commentators, which the clergyman of the place where I live, hath recommended to me. Thus furni&s;hed, I &s;hall venture to examine his &s;cripture arguments. One con&s;olation to me is, that he &s;eems to be an equal adept in theology and juri&s;|prudence.</P>
<P>"The will of the Almighty, as declared by Gideon and Samuel," &s;ays our republican, "ex|pre&s;sly di&s;approves of government by kings." So it might on tho&s;e particular occa&s;ions, and for &s;ome peculiar rea&s;ons; and yet our government by kings at this time, may be as acceptable to the Almighty, as any other government. "All anti-monarchical parts of &s;cripture," he continues, "have been &s;moothly glo&s;&s;ed over in monarchical governments." If &s;o, our author has profited by the practice, and has greatly improved on it; for he has entirely &s;lipt over, (without giving even a &s;mooth glo&s;s) all the monarchical parts of &s;crip|ture, except one, which I &s;hall immediately con|&s;ider, after a&s;&s;uring the reader, that I never have met with the anti-monarchical parts of &s;cripture. In the bible, I am &s;ure they are not. The Jewi&s;h polity, in which the Almighty him&s;elf conde|&s;cended to be king, (and thence called a Theocra|cy) is rather in favour of monarchy than again&s;t it; tho' I am not clear, that any one &s;pecies of re|gular government is more acceptable to the deity now than another; whatever preference may be due to one above another, in point of expediency and benefit.</P>
<P>"Render unto Cae&s;ar the things that are Cae|&s;ar's, is the &s;cripture doctrine of courts," &s;ays our author; and pray is it not &s;cripture doctrine
<PB N="32" REF="043050_0031_101CAF0618852D08">
in other places, as well as courts? Is it not the doctrine of Him who is the Saviour of men? The words are part of an an&s;wer which our Sa|viour returned to an in&s;idious que&s;tion that was propo&s;ed to him by &s;ome emi&s;&s;aries from the Phari&s;ees, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Whether it was lawful to pay tri|bute to Cae&s;ar, i. e. the Roman Emperor, or not? Judaea was at this time &s;ubject to the Ro|mans. The G<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ulonites, or Zealots, a &s;ect or party &s;o called, affirmed that the Jews, being God's people, &s;hould not acknowledge any other Lord, nor pay tribute to an heathen power&mdash;others affirmed the contrary&mdash;the determination was therefore put to Je&s;us, with de&s;ign to en&s;nare him. His deci&s;ion, which was for paying the tribute, was grounded on the then practice and e&s;tabli&s;hed maxims of the Jews. They held, that wherever the money of any per&s;on, bearing his title and image, was current, the inhabitants thereby acknowledged that per&s;on for their &s;ove|reign. Since, therefore, the Jews owned this of Cae&s;ar, by admitting his money, which bore his title and image, our Saviour told them, they &s;hould al&s;o pay him tribute. For he ordered the tribute money to be brought, and the Jews own|ing that it bore Cae&s;ar's image and &s;uper&s;cription, or title,&mdash;"Render therefore, (&s;ays he) to Cae&s;ar, the things that are Cae&s;ar's," i. e. Since you ac|knowledge his &s;overeignty over you by admitting his coin, render to him the tribute which, on your own principles, is thereby due.</P>
<P>If this text has been applied to &s;upport mo|narchical government any further than to &s;hew, that we&mdash;ever is by cu&s;tom, law or otherwi&s;e ju&s;tly due to &s;overeigns, &s;hould be punctually paid, whe|ther
<PB N="33" REF="043050_0032_101CAF07D9BAB738">
it be tribute, obedience, honour, &amp;c.&mdash;if, I &s;ay, it has been applied to &s;upport monarchy any further than this, it mu&s;t be by &s;ome per&s;on who under&s;tood it as little as our author; though not for the rea&s;on he a&s;&s;igns, and which in truth makes again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, in which our republican author triumphs mo&s;t; which, he &s;ays, "are direct and po&s;itive, and admit of no e|quivocal con&s;truction. That the Almighty has in them entered his prote&s;t again&s;t monarchical go|vernment, is true, or el&s;e the &s;cripture is fal&s;e." On the contrary, I aver, that the Almighty has not there entered his prote&s;t again&s;t monarchical government, further than the Jews had departed from a former permi&s;&s;ion he had given them to chu&s;e kings, and that the &s;cripture is not fal&s;e. Let us now &s;ee how a little common &s;en&s;e, rea&s;on and truth will help to clear up the matter.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ages alluded to by the author, are in 1 Sam. viii. where the I&s;raelites a&s;&s;embled in a tumultuous manner, and de&s;ired Samuel to make them "a king, to judge them like all the nati|ons;" which offended Samuel, and in &s;ome mea|&s;ure was di&s;plea&s;ing to the Almighty. That &s;imply de&s;iring a king, could not be a crime, is undeniably evident; becau&s;e the Almighty had long before expre&s;&s;ly permitted it, had directed the mode of chu&s;ing a king, and pre&s;cribed the line of conduct the king &s;hould ob&s;erve, when cho&s;en. This is done in Deuteronomy xvii. 14&mdash;20; and I &s;hall here lay a few of the pa&s;&s;ages before the reader.</P>
<P><Q>When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and &s;halt &s;ay,
<PB N="34" REF="043050_0033_101CAF0B1C113610">
I will &s;et a king over me like as all the nations that are round about me: thou &s;halt in any wi&s;e &s;et him king over thee whom the Lord thy God &s;hall chu&s;e: one from among thy brethren &s;halt thou &s;et king over thee: thou maye&s;t not &s;et a &s;tranger over thee which is not thy brother.</Q></P>
<P>The Almighty then proceeds to give directions for the king's conduct, thus cho&s;en; all wi&s;ely &s;uited to the Jewi&s;h &s;tate, both in a religious and political view. The king "was not to multi|ply hor&s;es;" to prevent any intercour&s;e with Egypt, which &s;upplied other nations with hor&s;es; and be&s;ides, cavalry was not &s;uited to the hilly coun|try of Judaea. The king was "not to multiply wives, that his heart turn not away;" as happened to Solomon when he di&s;obeyed this precept: Nor "greatly multiply gold and &s;ilver to him&s;elf," which would introduce luxury and di&s;&s;olution of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>The directions go on&mdash;<Q>And it &s;hall be when he, i. e. the king, fitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he &s;hall write a copy of this law in a book, and it &s;hall be with him, and he &s;hall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this law, and the&s;e &s;ta|tutes to do them: that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not a&s;ide from the commandment&mdash;to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom; he and his children in the mid&s;t of I&s;rael.</Q></P>
<P>Now after this, I leave the reader to judge, whether government by kings could be di&s;plea&s;ing to the Almighty; or whether de&s;iring a king,
<PB N="35" REF="043050_0034_101CAF1058941D40">
according to this permi&s;&s;ion and the&s;e directions could be a crime in the I&s;raelites. It is impo&s;&s;i|ble that either can be true. The crime of the&s;e people, therefore, when they de&s;ired a king of Samuel, "to judge them like all the nations," mu&s;t be attributed to &s;omething el&s;e. And upon examination, we &s;hall find, that their error lay in the manner of their a&s;king a king&mdash;in the princi|ples on which they acted&mdash;in a di&s;regard of the venerable old prophet&mdash;but chiefly in a neglect of the directions above mentioned. This will appear evident from a bare recital of facts.</P>
<P>Samuel, by his faithful admini&s;tration, had re|&s;tored the purity of religion, and re&s;cued the na|tion from the ho&s;tile attempts of their enemies. Debauched by pro&s;perity, as too frequently hap|pens, dazzled with the lu&s;tre of a &s;plendid court, and de&s;irous of its pomp, the people tumultu|ou&s;ly a&s;&s;embled to de&s;ire a king, who would re|&s;emble the de&s;potic kings which &s;urrounded them. They covered their real de&s;ign with the pretext of Samuel's age and infirmities, and his &s;ons irregularities, which was in&s;ulting the prophet's misfortunes. This is evidently implied in their own words, and in the &s;equel.</P>
<P><Q>Behold, (&s;ay they to Samuel) thou art old and thy &s;ons walk not in thy ways; now <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> us a king to judge us like <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</Q> Hereby Samuel, who had faith<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> had been di&s;placed; and &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> they de&s;ired, had de&s;tro<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> were under.

<PB N="36" REF="043050_0035_101CAF138AD4D7A8">
that they have rejected. Although Samuel was ungratefully treated; yet they &s;till more wickedly neglected the directions given by the Almighty. Pride and ambition, &s;timulated them to &s;eek a king, not &s;uch as the Almighty had directed them to chu&s;e; but &s;uch as the nations had; and &s;uch as would overturn the theocracy. This was virtu|ally rejecting the Almighty from being their king.</P>
<P>Samuel, however, was directed to hearken to the people; but at the &s;ame time to lay al&s;o before them, the nature of that monarchy they de&s;ired, a monarchy like tho&s;e around them. The ea&s;tern nations, it is well known, were under de&s;potic monarchs, the manner or nature of which Samuel accordingly de&s;cribes to the I&s;raelites, to try whether they would per&s;i&s;t in their choice after hearing it. Kings of this &s;ort would <Q>take their &s;ons and appoint them for him&s;elf, for his cha|riots, and to be his hor&s;emen&mdash;he would take their daughters to be confectioners, and to be cooks, and to be bakers, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>This whole pa&s;&s;age is a de&s;cription of the ea&s;tern de&s;potic monarchs, which Samuel held up to the I&s;raelites, with de&s;ign to deter them from chu&s;ing &s;uch; and this is the pa&s;&s;age which our author &s;ets down, enriched with his own mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> comments, to &s;hew that God "enter|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> again&s;t monarchical government in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, in truth, it is only an ac|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> de&s;potic monarchies of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> directed to lay before <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> might &s;ee how incon&s;i&s;t|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> with their peculiar &s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> again with de&s;ign to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></P>

Ambition and pride, however, got the better of duty and intere&s;t with the people&mdash;a ca&s;e that happens but too frequently. They &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on having the king they had &s;et their hearts on&mdash;<Q>That we al&s;o, &s;ay they, may be like other na|tions.</Q> Hereby &s;hewng the greate&s;t blindne&s;s to their own happine&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ted in being unlike the other nations, by having God him&s;elf for their king; and &s;uch a judge or king as would be his DEPUTY, not an ab&s;olute prince. The Almighty at la&s;t conde&s;cended to their infirmities, and gave them a king; but as in the ca&s;e of the ritual law, he tempered his ju&s;tice with his mercy. He gave them Saul, who proved a &s;courge; yet he ordered matters &s;o that the general end of his di&s;pen&s;ation to the Jews was not defeated. Saul's &s;ucce&s;&s;or, was "a man after his own heart," by a zealous attachment to, and punctual execution of, the Mo&s;aic law; and David again, in our author's phra&s;e, "to the evil of monarchy, ad|ded that of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion;" which it &s;eems, however, the Almighty did not di&s;approve of.</P>
<P>The reader is now left to determine freely, whether the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages make in the lea&s;t again&s;t government by kings; and whether this republi|can's perver&s;ion of them, either thro' real or af|fected ignorance, &s;hould have any weight to in|fluence us again&s;t our &s;overeign. For my part, I think the ca&s;e &s;o plain, that I &s;hall not be&s;tow another word upon it; only to add the following reflections of a learned writer on the above tran&s;|action. <Q>The &s;ecret &s;pring of the people's con|duct, (&s;ays he) was the ambition of their lead|ers, who could live no longer without the &s;plendor of a regal court&mdash;where every one of
<PB N="38" REF="043050_0037_101CAF1855887380">
them might &s;hine a di&s;tingui&s;hed officer of &s;tate. This it was that made their demand criminal; for the chu&s;ing regal, rather than ari&s;tocratical, vice-roys, was a thing plainly in|dulged to them by the law of Mo&s;es, Deutero|nomy xvii. As therefore ambition only was in the view of the ringleaders, and no fooli&s;h fears for the &s;tate, or hopes of bettering the public admini&s;tration, it is evident to all ac|quainted with the genius of this time and peo|ple, that compliance with their demand mu&s;t have ended in the utter de&s;truction of the Mo|&s;aic religion, as well as law.</Q></P>
<P>Thus ambition &s;et the I&s;raelites on de&s;iring a King; our republican author &s;hould reflect, whe|ther the &s;ame principle does not actuate and lead him to reject his lawful &s;overeign.</P>
<P>The author of Common Sen&s;e, &s;u&s;pects, "there is as much king-craft as prie&s;t-craft, in with-hold|ing the &s;cripture from the public in Popi&s;h countries. For monarchy is the Popery of government." But is it not &s;trange that he him&s;elf &s;hould be guilty of the very crime he here charges upon others? Yet he does this by with-holding from the reader every text that would develope the fal&s;hood of his own beloved &s;cheme. This I think may be called Republican-craft; and let it hereafter be added to the two &s;pecies of craft above mentioned. A man of candour would deal fairly, and give both &s;ides of the que&s;tion. Had there been another text in the bible that could be pre&s;&s;ed into his &s;er|vice, be&s;ides what he has quoted, we may be &s;ure he would have produced it, with his own enlight|ened comments. With his good leave, therefore, I &s;hall now &s;et down a few texts, which probably
<PB N="39" REF="043050_0038_101CAF1D94177A78">
he may call the "&s;cripture doctrine of monarchy;" but which are the words of in&s;pired truth notwith|&s;tanding. I a&s;&s;ure the reader further, that I am none of your "pa&s;&s;ive-obedience and non-re&s;i&s;t|ance men." The principles on which the glori|ous revolution in 1688 was brought about, con|&s;titute the articles of my political creed; and were it nece&s;&s;ary, I could clearly evince, that the&s;e are perfectly conformable to the doctrines of &s;cripture.

<HEAD>ANSWER TO SECTION III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Thoughts on the pre&s;ent State of American Affairs.</HEAD>
<P>IF the per&s;on who was capable of &s;o vile a pro&s;titution of &s;cripture, as we have &s;een in the preceding &s;ection, &s;hould equally pro&s;titute the words, rea&s;on, argument, common &s;en&s;e, in this, it is not to be wondered at. That this is the ca&s;e, will appear by a near examination. From the author's de&s;ultory way of writing, and want of method in delivering his thoughts, it is not ea&s;y to follow him,&mdash;however, I mu&s;t do as well as I can.</P>
<P>In this &s;ection before me, this Gentleman un|folds his grand &s;cheme of a revolt from the crown of England, and &s;etting up an independent re|public in America. He leaves no method un|tried, which the mo&s;t experienced practioner in the art of deceiving could invent, to per&s;uade any people to a mea&s;ure which was again&s;t their inclinations and intere&s;t, that was both di&s;agree|able and de&s;tructive. He un&s;ays in one place what he had &s;aid in another, if it happens to &s;erve the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; he cants and whines; he tries wit, raillery and declamation by turns. But his main attack is upon the pa&s;&s;ions of his readers, e&s;pecially their pity and re&s;entment,&mdash;the latter of which is too apt to be predominant in mankind. As for him&s;elf, he &s;eems to be every where tran&s;ported with rage&mdash;a rage that knows no limits, and hurries him along, like an
<PB N="43" REF="043050_0042_101CAF296F8FA8C0">
impetuous torrent. Every thing that falls not in with his own &s;cheme, or that he happens to di&s;|like, is repre&s;ented in the mo&s;t aggravated light, and with the mo&s;t di&s;torted features. Such a malignant &s;pirit I have &s;eldom met with in any compo&s;ition. As often as I look into this &s;ection, I cannot forbear imaging to my&s;elf a guilty culprit, fre&s;h reeking from the la&s;hes of indig|nant ju&s;tice, and raging again&s;t the hand that inflicted them. Yet I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf, that &s;uch fire and fury are genuine marks of pa|trioti&s;m. On the contrary, they rather indicate that &s;ome mortifying di&s;appointment is rankling at heart; that &s;ome tempting object of ambition is in view; or probably both. I always adopt the amiable Bi&s;hop Berkeley's maxim in &s;uch ca&s;es,&mdash;<Q>I &s;ee a man rage, rail and rave; I &s;u&s;|pect his patrioti&s;m.</Q></P>
<P>That the&s;e ob&s;ervations are ju&s;tified by the author's own words, I &s;hall now proceed to evince; and I doubt not but the candid reader will con&s;i|der what I &s;ay in the &s;en&s;e it is meant&mdash;as directed again&s;t this republican's ruinous &s;cheme of inde|pendency. This, and this only, is what I combat. My mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h&mdash;next to future happine&s;s&mdash;is, to &s;ee tranquillity re&s;tored to America&mdash;our liberties, property and trade &s;ettled on a firm, generous, and con&s;titutional plan, &s;o that neither of the former &s;hould be invaded, nor the latter impoliticly or unju&s;tly re&s;trained; that in con&s;e|quence of this, a perfect reconciliation with Great-Britain were effected, an union formed, by which both countries, &s;upporting and &s;upported by each other, might ri&s;e to eminence and glory, and be the admiration of mankind till time &s;hall
<PB N="44" REF="043050_0043_101CAF2CD79B6178">
be no more. In &s;uch a plan, the real intere&s;t of America is indubitably to be &s;ought; and could my influence avail, there would not be a di&s;&s;ent|ing voice in the colonies&mdash;all would unite as one man, and u&s;e every effort, to have &s;uch a plan &s;peedily &s;ettled.</P>
<P>The author of Common Sen&s;e &s;ays, "He has no other preliminaries to &s;ettle with the reader, than that he would dive&s;t him&s;elf of prejudice and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;uffer his rea&s;on and feel|ings to determine for them&s;elves." I have no objection to the&s;e preliminaries. They are &s;uch as I my&s;elf would chu&s;e to &s;ettle with the reader; provided his feelings are not tho&s;e of rage and re&s;entment, which are exceedingly improper to determine in matters of &s;uch moment. It is not improbable indeed, that every republican who is as prejudiced, intere&s;ted, and vindictive as him&s;elf, will agree with him in all his extrava|gancies; and &s;o perhaps they would, though an angel from Heaven were to a&s;&s;ure them that they are wrong. But I am confident the readers of that &s;tamp make but a very &s;mall number at pre|&s;ent in America.</P>
<P>After ob&s;erving, that "many writers have embarked in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, with various de&s;igns," he &s;ays, "they have all been ineffectual, and the period of debate is clo&s;ed. Arms, as the la&s;t re&s;ource, decide the conte&s;t; the appeal was the choice of the King, and the continent ac|cepted the challenge." That an appeal was made by the King to arms for the deci&s;ion of this un|happy conte&s;t, on the 19th of April, the period our author fixes, is a matter in which I am not quite clear; but more of this pre&s;ently. If &s;uch
<PB N="45" REF="043050_0044_101CAF300BDC2200">
a challenge was accepted by the Americans, I am &s;ure it was with great reluctance. They de&s;ired it not; although this writer, by his manner of expre&s;&s;ion, in&s;inuates they did. But be the&s;e matters as they will, certain it is, that the period of debate did not then clo&s;e. The challenge was not accepted &s;o as to exclude an amicable accommodation. Since that time, the Honour|able Continental Congre&s;s petitioned the King, and tran&s;mitted addre&s;&s;es to the inhabitants of Great-Britain and Ireland, to facilitate a reconci|liation. Nor can I conceive it po&s;&s;ible, that any one, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;anguinary wretch, who hopes to profit by our confu&s;ions, &s;hould wi&s;h to &s;ee the conte&s;t finally decided by arms.</P>
<P>"By referring the matter from argument to arms, a new aera of politics is &s;truck&mdash;all plans, propo&s;als, &amp;c. prior to the 19th of April&mdash;are like the almanacks of la&s;t year; which, tho' proper then, are &s;uperceded and u&s;ele&s;s now." I &s;hall not undertake to decide on the value of old almanacks, as I am not an almanack-maker&mdash;the author may know more of the matter. But he here takes for granted what &s;hould have been proved, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the matter or conte&s;t was ulti|mately referred from argument to arms. If the &s;en&s;e of our Congre&s;s, and of the inhabitants of this continent at large, is any rule to judge by, all plans and propo&s;als, even tho&s;e prior to the 19th of April, are not u&s;ele&s;s. A free people, who have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their rights and liberties, are very ju&s;tifiable in &s;hewing they will not tamely give them up without a &s;truggle. But no people, except &s;ome tribes of &s;avages, who aim at the total extermination of their enemies, will ever
<PB N="46" REF="043050_0045_101CAF37586F6EA0">
lo&s;e &s;ight of argument and negociation, to termi|nate &s;uch di&s;putes. To in&s;inuate the contrary of the Americans, is at once doing them the greate&s;t inju&s;tice, and offering them the greate&s;t in&s;ult. No people under Heaven are le&s;s &s;anguinary, or de&s;erve &s;uch a character le&s;s.</P>
<P>Our author repeats the &s;ame &s;entiment el&s;e|where. "No man," &s;ays he, "was a warmer wi&s;her for reconciliation than my&s;elf, before the fatal 19th of April, 1775; but the moment the event of that day was made known, I rejected the hardened, &s;ullen tempered Pharaoh of Eng|land for ever; and di&s;dain the wretch, that with the pretended title of father of his people, can unfeelingly hear of their &s;laughter, and compo&s;edly &s;leep with their blood upon his &s;oul." This is the man, gentle reader, who declares, "he is not in|duced by motives of pride, party or re&s;entment, to e&s;pou&s;e the doctrine of &s;eparation and indepen|dence;" no, no; and if you will take his own word for it, he is by no means for "inflaming or exaggerating matters!" The reader mu&s;t be &s;en|&s;ible, that a per&s;on who can thus &s;et truth and decency at defiance, and is regardle&s;s of even the appearance of con&s;i&s;tency, has a great advantage over his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>The affair of April 19, 1775, alluded to here, is the expedition to Lexington, and &s;kirmi&s;h that en&s;ued&mdash;a mo&s;t ra&s;h, ill-judged expedition un|doubtedly. It was ri&s;quing the lives of innocent and brave men on both &s;ides, as well as the peace of this whole continent, for no other object than de&s;troying a few barrels of flour! Our author has my leave to load that expedition, with all the reproaches he can invent. I di&s;approve of
<PB N="47" REF="043050_0046_101CAF38E90FE6E0">
it as much as he&mdash;I lament its effects much more. But why is the king charged with it, or blamed for it? Did he order that expedition? No&mdash;he knew nothing of it&mdash;he gave no orders, general or particular, for it. So far from this, that I have been repeatedly a&s;&s;ured from the very be&s;t authority, that his orders to all his commanders or generals on this continent were, to act only on the defen&s;ive&mdash;and to avoid &s;hedding the blood of his &s;ubjects. Now, after giving &s;uch re&s;train|ing orders, how the blood of tho&s;e who were kil|led at the di&s;tance of three thou&s;and miles from him, could be "on his &s;oul," is utterly incon|ceivable. Nor do I believe that he "unfeelingly heard of their &s;laughter." The King's real cha|racter is ju&s;t the rever&s;e of what is here fal&s;ly and maliciou&s;ly held up to view. I was a&s;&s;ured lately in England, by tho&s;e who knew him well, that his temper is compa&s;&s;ionate and humane,&mdash;his moral character unblemi&s;hed, and in religion ex|emplary. If this republican, therefore, rejected his Sovereign on account of the Lexington affair, it was only becau&s;e he had little or no attachment to him. This accident could only be &s;eized to give vent to di&s;affection which &s;lumbered before; for an accident it certainly was. To accu&s;e even a private man fal&s;ly, and lay guilt to his charge, of which he is innocent, is highly criminal; to do &s;o to an ordinary magi&s;trate, is &s;till more at|rocious: But to revile one's Sovereign thus fal&s;ly, to poi&s;on the minds of his &s;ubjects, and &s;ow di&s;|affection among them, which may be productive of general mi&s;ery, is a crime of &s;uch complicated guilt, that none but men of the mo&s;t abandoned profligate hearts, are capable of committing.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="043050_0047_101CAF3AD1B1A9C0">
After all, it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;ign any good rea&s;on, why a reconciliation with Great-Britain, which was &s;o proper before the Lexington affair, &s;hould be &s;o improper afterwards. Our author, indeed, in his u&s;ual way, dogmatically a&s;&s;erts it; but his a&s;&s;ertions will not pa&s;s for proofs. If peace and reconciliation on con&s;titutional grounds, and proper &s;ecurity for our &s;everal rights, was de&s;irable and advantageous before the 19th of April, mu&s;t they not have been equally &s;o after the event of that unfortunate day? Let rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"But as &s;o much has been &s;aid of the advan|tages of reconciliation," continues our author, "it is but right that we &s;hould examine the con|trary &s;ide of the argument, and inquire into the material injuries which the colonies &s;u&s;tain, and always will &s;u&s;tain by being connected with Great-Britain." He alledges, indeed, &s;everal evils which he &s;uppo&s;es would attend that connection; but cautiou&s;ly avoids any mention of the numberle&s;s evils and calamities which we mu&s;t infallibly &s;uf|fer by breaking it off. As in a former ca&s;e, &s;o in this al&s;o, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;upply his omi&s;|&s;ion in due time.</P>
<P>"Some have a&s;&s;erted," he tells us, "that as America hath flouri&s;hed under her former con|nection with Great-Britain, that the &s;ame con|nection is nece&s;&s;ary towards her future happine&s;s. Nothing can be more fallacious." He adds,&mdash;"We may as well a&s;&s;ert, that becau&s;e a child hath thrived upon milk, that it is never to have meat." However glib this quaint &s;imile may run upon paper; however convincing it may appear to &s;hal|low readers; yet, in truth, when examined, it
<PB N="49" REF="043050_0048_101CAF3E74E60DA0">
contains a palpable impropriety, and is imperti|nent to the ca&s;e before us. Great-Britain is figu|ratively called the parent &s;tate of the colonies; their connection, therefore, may be properly com|pared to the relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between parent and child. But to compare our connection with Great-Britain to the literal food of a child, a thing different from, and not nece&s;&s;arily belong|ing to that relation, is manife&s;tly ab&s;urd, and a violation of the propriety of language; as all who are judges of the nature of language mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible. The relation of parent and child ends not, when the latter has arrived to maturity, although the u&s;e of milk may be laid a&s;ide; and that relation may be &s;till nece&s;&s;ary to the happi|ne&s;s of both; the &s;ame may be truly affirmed of our connection with Great-Britain. But if we mu&s;t &s;tretch the &s;imile further, and find &s;omething analogous to the literal food of a child, it is the literal &s;upport afforded by Great-Britain to the colonies, in their infant &s;tate formerly; and the admini&s;tration of the colonies now, as well as the general laws of regulation &s;he may make for us. As to any &s;upport now, in the above &s;en&s;e, it is confe&s;&s;ed the colonies do not require it. With re&s;pect to the admini&s;tration of the colonies, and regulating laws proper for them, the&s;e &s;hould cer|tainly be varied, and adapted to our maturer &s;tate. The want of this is the true &s;ource of our pre&s;ent calamities; and the attainment of it, by a reconciliation and con&s;titutional union with Great-Britain, is what every hone&s;t American &s;hould earne&s;tly wi&s;h for. But the remedy pro|po&s;ed by our author, would re&s;emble the conduct of a ra&s;h, froward &s;tripling, who &s;hould call his
<PB N="50" REF="043050_0049_101CAF43D27E6BB8">
mother a d-mn-d b&mdash;ch, &s;wear he had no relation to her, and attempted to knock her down.</P>
<P>"But even this," &s;ubjoins our author, "is admitting more than is true; for I an&s;wer, round|ly, that America, would have flouri&s;hed as much, and probably much more had no European power taken any notice of her. The commerce by which &s;he hath enriched her&s;elf, are the nece&s;&s;a|ries of life, and will always have a market while eating is the cu&s;tom of Europe." If no Euro|pean power had taken any notice of America, that is to &s;ay, if none had been at the expence or trouble of di&s;covering it, and &s;ettling colonies in it; there is great probability that America had not flouri&s;hed, but remained to this day as &s;avage a wilderne&s;s as when Columbus or Cabbot fir&s;t de&s;cried its coa&s;ts.&mdash;But to pa&s;s over this blun|der. Let the reader only turn to any hi&s;tory of the &s;ettlement of the Briti&s;h colonies, and then judge what had been the condition of Virginia, the fir&s;t colony, and latterly of Georgia and Nova-Scotia, if Great-Britain had not &s;upported them. They mu&s;t as infallibly have peri&s;hed, as an infant without its proper food, had not Great-Britain afforded her aid and &s;upport; which have been more or le&s;s extended to all the colonies. Even after they had &s;urmounted their fir&s;t difficul|ties, what had been their fate, had not Great|Britain protected them? It &s;o happens, that ava|rice, ambition and fighting, are cu&s;toms of Eu|rope as well as eating. This being the ca&s;e, &s;ome other European power would indubitably have &s;eized all the&s;e colonies, in their infant &s;tate, had not Great-Britain held out her protection.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="043050_0050_101CAF455FF32B30">
And here much matter of grief is pre&s;ented to this poor Gentleman. He pathetically laments, that&mdash;"Alas! we have been long led away by ancient prejudices, and made large &s;acrifices to &s;uper&s;tition"&mdash;by "not con&s;idering that the mo|tive of Great-Britain In protecting us, was intere&s;t, not attachment;" and then he &s;pins out a tedious, affected &s;entence of her "not protecting us from our enemies on our account, but from her enemies on her own account," &amp;c. Suppo&s;ing this were true, where is the harm? Great-Britain actually did protect us; and it is a matter of little mo|ment to us, what her motives were. If &s;he re|ceived benefit by it, &s;o much the better. Mutual intere&s;t is the &s;tronge&s;t bond of union between &s;tates, as the hi&s;tory of mankind te&s;tifies; and certainly that nation would act a mo&s;t ab&s;urd, as well as wicked part, which lavi&s;hed away its blood and trea&s;ure, without any pro&s;pect of national ad|vantage in return. But I firmly believe, that his a&s;&s;ertions on this head are as fal&s;e, as they are ungenerous; and that Great-Britain, in protecting us, was actuated by motives of affection and attachment, as well as intere&s;t. The whole of her conduct to the colonies, till lately, evinces it&mdash;the Americans them&s;elves have acknowledged it. Great-Britain, no doubt, derived many advan|tages from the colonies; but &s;hould we underva|lue her protection on that account, or a&s;cribe it to &s;ordid motives only? It is every man's intere&s;t as well as duty to be hone&s;t; would it, therefore, be candid, generous or true, to &s;uppo&s;e, that every hone&s;t man is actuated by &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s only?&mdash;But candour and truth are things that have nothing to do with the procedure of this dark republican,
<PB N="52" REF="043050_0051_101CAF48CFADFA20">
who aims at utterly effacing every trace of former affection and friend&s;hip between Great-Britain and the colonies; and, like a fiend that delighted in human mi&s;ery, would arm them with the mo&s;t deadly, irreconcilable hatred again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>But he denies that Britain is the parent country or tho&s;e colonies. He "reprobates the phra&s;e, as being fal&s;e, &s;elfi&s;h, narrow and ungenerous.&mdash;Europe, (&s;ays he) and not England, is the pa|rent country of the colonies." It is an ob&s;erva|tion of Epictetus, <Q>That if a man will contra|dict the mo&s;t evident truths, it will not be ea&s;y to find arguments wherewith to confute him&mdash;that the di&s;po&s;ition to contradict &s;uch truths, proceeds from want of candour and mode&s;ty.</Q> He moreover adds,&mdash;that when &s;om adventruous &s;pirits in his time undertook to deny the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t evident truths&mdash;<Q>This denial was ad|mired by the vulgar for &s;trength of wit and great learning.</Q></P>
<P>Whatever circum&s;tances can denominate any country to be the parent &s;tate or country of co|lonies, may be truly predicated of Britain, with re&s;pect to the&s;e American colonies. They were di&s;covered at the expence of the Briti&s;h crown&mdash;fir&s;t &s;ettled by Briti&s;h emigrants, and the govern|ments erected here were formed on the model of the Briti&s;h government, as nearly as the &s;tate of things would admit. The coloni&s;ts were deemed Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and intitled to all the privileges of Engli&s;hmen. They were &s;upported and pro|tected at the expence of Briti&s;h blood and trea|&s;ure. Emigrants, it is true, re&s;orted here from other countries in great numbers; but the&s;e were not intitled to the privileges of Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects,
<PB N="53" REF="043050_0052_101CAF4E64EC9748">
till naturalized by an act of the Briti&s;h le|gi&s;lature, or &s;ome A&s;&s;embly here; and the pro|digious confluence of &s;trangers into the colonies, is a proof of the mild and liberal &s;pirit by which they were cheri&s;hed and admini&s;tered. If the&s;e particulars do not intitle Britain to the appellati|on of mother country, to the&s;e colonies, I know not what can; and the&s;e particulars cannot be predicated of any other country in Europe, be|&s;ides Britain.</P>
<P>The author tells us, however&mdash;"that the phra&s;e parent or mother country, hath been je&s;u|itically adopted by the king and his para&s;ites, with a low papi&s;tical de&s;ign of gaining an unfair bias on the credulous weakne&s;s of our minds." I conceive the pre&s;ent king, or his para&s;ites, as he calls them, were not the fir&s;t or only per&s;ons who adopted this phra&s;e; and therefore it could not an&s;wer &s;uch a de&s;ign. The phra&s;e hath al|ways been u&s;ed, both here, and in Britain, &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the colonies.</P>
<P>But this curious ob&s;ervation was introduced purely to in&s;inuate that the king is a papi&s;t; which hath ju&s;t as much truth in it as to in&s;inuate that he is a Mahometan or Gentoo; for there is not a firmer Prote&s;tant in Great-Britain, than his pre|&s;ent Maje&s;ty. The in&s;inuation might have &s;ome effect on the credulous weakne&s;s of &s;ome ignorant people, who have harboured &s;uch an opinion; and I have heard the Quebec bill, alledged as a proof of it, by which, they &s;aid, popery was e&s;tabli&s;hed in Canada, and the king had violated his coronation oath.</P>
<P>An examination of the Quebec bill, falls not within the compa&s;s of my de&s;ign. It has under|gone
<PB N="54" REF="043050_0053_101CAF4FF44B2D30">
the &s;crutiny of much abler hands; &s;ome of which have affirmed, and others denied, that po|pery was thereby e&s;tabli&s;hed. I di&s;like the bill, chiefly becau&s;e it ve&s;ts the governor and his coun|cil with exorbitant power. It is certain, however, that the popi&s;h clergy of Canada, complain of the bill, and think them&s;elves in a wor&s;e &s;ituation by it, than the articles of capitulation and &s;ur|render left them. Be all this as it may, it is pa&s;t any doubt, that the king did not in the lea&s;t vio|late his coronation oath by a&s;&s;enting to that bill. This will evidently appear by in&s;pecting the oath it&s;elf; and as the removal of mutual prejudices to faciliate a reconciliation, is my principal view; as the oath is &s;hort, and has been &s;een by few, I &s;hall here in&s;ert it. The coronation oath is ad|mini&s;tered by one of the archbi&s;hops or bi&s;hops, in the following words and manner&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>The archbi&s;hop &s;hall &s;ay,</HI> Will you &s;olemnly pro|mi&s;e and &s;wear, to govern the people of this king|dom of England, and the dominions thereunto belonging, according to the &s;tatutes in parlia|ment agreed on, and the laws and cu&s;toms of the &s;ame? <HI>The king &s;hall &s;ay,</HI> I &s;olemnly promi&s;e &s;o to do.</P>
<P><HI>The archbi&s;hop.</HI> Will you, to your power, cau&s;e law and ju&s;tice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments? <HI>King.</HI> I will.</P>
<P><HI>The archbi&s;hop.</HI> Will you, to the utmo&s;t of your power, maintain the laws of God; the true profe&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel, and the prote&s;tant re|formed religion, e&s;tabli&s;hed by law? And will you pre&s;erve unto the bi&s;hops and clergy of this realm, and to the churches committed to their charge, all &s;uch rights and privileges, as by the
<PB N="55" REF="043050_0054_101CAF536B9228D8">
law do or &s;hall appertain unto them, or any of them? <HI>King.</HI> All this, I promi&s;e to do.</P>
<P><HI>After this the king laying his hand on the holy go&s;pels, &s;hall &s;ay,</HI> The things which I have here before promi&s;ed, I will perform and keep: So help me God. <HI>And then &s;hall ki&s;s the book.</HI></P>
<P>This is the coronation oath, and mode of ad|mini&s;tering it, as pre&s;cribed by law; and the rea|der mu&s;t &s;ee that it has no more relation to the &s;tate of religion in Canada, a conquered country, than to the &s;tate of religion in Minorca, a con|quered i&s;land, the inhabitants of which are pa|pi&s;ts, and enjoy as great, if not greater privileges than the Canadians.</P>
<P>"But admitting," continues our author, "that we were all of Engli&s;h de&s;cent, what does it a|mount to? Nothing. Britain being now an open enemy, extingui&s;hes every other name and title; and to &s;ay that reconciliation is a duty, is truly farcical." Here the farcical argument meets me again; and what &s;hall I &s;ay to it? I prote&s;t I do not under&s;tand it. I have &s;earched for its mean|ing in vain; and have no hope of fathoming it, till the author is plea&s;ed to explain it. But to the point in hand. If what would promote our hap|pine&s;s and intere&s;t, to mention nothing el&s;e, be a duty, then reconciliation is our duty.</P>
<P>He el&s;ewhere enlarges on this head. "Bring the doctrine of reconciliation," &s;ays he, "to the touch-&s;tone of nature, and then tell me, whether you can hereafter love, honour and faithfully &s;erve the power that carried fire and &s;word into your land!" All this, and a great deal more of the kind, can only proceed from a &s;uppo&s;ition of the author, that others are as vindictive and unfor|giving
<PB N="56" REF="043050_0055_101CAF5528DCC508">
as him&s;elf. When &s;tates go to war, mu|tual acts of ho&s;tility mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ue; and to think that no reconciliation &s;hould afterwards take place between them, is as contrary to every dictate of humanity and religion, as to think that a private per&s;on &s;hould never forgive a private injury, or be reconciled to him that offered it. I lament as much as any one, the blood that has been &s;hed, and the deva&s;tation that has been made during this conte&s;t: But the&s;e have been compa|ratively &s;mall, if we con&s;ider the torrents of blood that have flowed, the wide-&s;pread ruin that has taken place, in the frequent de&s;tructive wars be|tween England and Scotland; yet the&s;e nations are now happily united&mdash;they mutually love, honour and faithfully &s;erve each other.</P>
<P>The author refers us to the &s;tate of Bo&s;ton, and paints the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of its inhabitants in the &s;trong|e&s;t colours, to &s;timulate the revenge of Ameri|cans, and bani&s;h every idea of reconciliation with Britain. I &s;incerely take part in the calamities of Bo&s;ton, and other places that have &s;uffered. I feel the mo&s;t tender &s;ympathetic pity for the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of their inhabitants. But how the &s;hed|ding of more blood, or &s;preading equal deva&s;tati|on along the whole &s;ea coa&s;t of this continent&mdash;the inevitable con&s;equences of not li&s;tening to recon|ciliation&mdash;how the&s;e, I &s;ay, can alleviate the mi&s;|fortunes of the people of Bo&s;ton, or any other &s;uf|ferers, is what I am not able to &s;ee.</P>
<P>"Much hath been &s;aid," he tells us, "of the united &s;trength of Britain and the colonies; that in conjunction they might bid defiance to the world: But this is a mere pre&s;umption; the fate of war is uncertain&mdash;the next war may not
<PB N="57" REF="043050_0056_101CAF5AE1E31838">
turn out like the la&s;t." But he chants quite ano|ther tune, when he would hold up the advantages of a &s;eparation from Britain. In that ca&s;e he avers&mdash;"'Tis not in the power of England, or of Europe to conquer America&mdash;nay, our pre|&s;ent numbers are &s;ufficient to repel the force of the whole world!"&mdash;This is only one &s;ample, among a thou&s;and, of the duplicity and contra|diction which run through this pamphlet.</P>
<P>After telling us what is very true, that we have no bu&s;ine&s;s to "&s;et the world at defiance," he adds, as an inducement to &s;eparate from Britain&mdash;"Our plan is commerce; and that well attended to, will &s;ecure us the peace and friend&s;hip of Europe, becau&s;e it is the intere&s;t of Europe to have America a free port. Her trade will always be a protection, and her barrenne&s;s of gold and &s;ilver will &s;ecure her from invaders."&mdash;Yes, yes; no doubt but if America were once to throw off her connection with Britain, the golden age would be re&s;tored! The Millennial &s;tate would com|mence. <Q>Men would in&s;tantly beat their &s;words into plough-&s;hears, and their &s;pears into prun|ing hooks. Nation would not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, nor learn war any more.</Q> Such are the happy times our author promi&s;es us, if America were an independent republic! But until he can give us &s;ome a&s;&s;urance that may be relied on, that ambition, pride, avarice, and all that dark train of pa&s;&s;ions which u&s;ually attends them, will be extingui&s;hed in the human brea&s;t, and will no more exert their baneful influence, I mu&s;t beg leave to doubt the truth of his a&s;&s;ertions&mdash;I mu&s;t que&s;tion, whether we &s;hall live in perpetual peace with Europe, or even with each other, after our revolt from England.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="043050_0057_101CAF5E189BAAD8">
The argument or rea&s;on he advances for it here, is contradicted by general experience and matter of fact. A flouri&s;hing trade naturally in|crea&s;es wealth; and for this, and other rea&s;ons, as naturally leads to war. Carthage, Venice and Holland&mdash;all commercial republics&mdash;were fre|quently engaged in bloody wars, in the days of their pro&s;perity. Nor is "barrenne&s;s of gold and &s;ilver" any &s;ecurity again&s;t war or inva&s;ions. Ex|perience and fact are equally again&s;t this po&s;ition. I never heard of the gold or &s;ilver mines of Flan|ders. The Low Countries are intirely barren of both; but they are remarkable for their fertility, good pa&s;turage, manufactures, and formerly for trade: Yet I may &s;ay, each field there is a field of blood, and has been the &s;cene of &s;ome dread|ful carnage. Great-Britain and France have few or no gold and &s;ilver mines; yet they have been theatres of bloody wars, as long as any record we have of either reaches. On the other hand, South America &s;upplies half the globe with gold and &s;ilver; and yet, &s;trange to tell, on our author's principles, no rival power has ever contended with Spain or Portugal for the dominion of South America! No invaders have attempted to di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;s them!</P>
<P>The truth is, that mines producing tho&s;e metals are rather injurious than beneficial to any country. They unbrace the nerves of indu&s;try, induce &s;loth, and damp the &s;pirit of commerce. Spain was one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing, powerful monarchies in Europe, when this continent was di&s;covered. Peru and Mexico then poured their immen&s;e trea&s;ures into her lap, and have been doing &s;o ever &s;ince; yet Spain ever &s;ince has been
<PB N="59" REF="043050_0058_101CAF65373218B0">
on the decline, and is dwindled, notwith&s;tanding her gold and &s;ilver, into a &s;tate, I may &s;ay, of in&s;ignificance. The country that abounds in fer|tile fields and luxuriant pa&s;turage&mdash;that produces the nece&s;&s;aries of life in abundance&mdash;that fur|ni&s;hes the various materials for indu&s;try and art, and the articles for an exten&s;ive commerce; &s;uch a country, though barren of gold and &s;ilver, is the mo&s;t inviting to ambition, the mo&s;t expo&s;ed to inva&s;ions; and &s;uch a country is North-Ame|rica.</P>
<P>But our author now waxes &s;o exceedingly warm, and a&s;&s;umes &s;o terrific an air, that I almo&s;t dread to approach him. "I challenge," &s;ays he, "the warme&s;t advocate for reconciliation, to &s;hew a &s;ingle advantage that this country can reap by being connected with Great-Britain. I repeat the challenge, not a &s;ingle advantage is derived."</P>
<P>The po&s;itive, dogmatical manner in which this challenge is repeated, reminds me of an ob&s;erva|tion made by the excellent Dr. Beattic, which applies, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, as exactly, as if this blu&s;tering challenge had given ri&s;e to it. "In reading &s;ceptical books," &s;ays the worthy Doc|tor, <Q>I have often found, that the &s;trength of the author's attachment to his paradox, is in pro|portion to its ab&s;urdity. If it deviates but a little from common opinion, he gives him&s;elf but little trouble about it; if it be incon&s;i&s;tent with univer&s;al belief, he conde&s;cends to argue the matter, and to bring what with him pa&s;&s;es for a proof of it; if it be &s;uch as no man ever did or could believe, he is &s;till more conceited of his proof, and calls it demon&s;tration; but if it is inconceivable, it is a wonder if he does
<PB N="60" REF="043050_0059_101CAF66D11323B8">
not take it for granted.</Q> Our republican takes it for granted, that no advantage could re&s;ult from our future connection with Great-Britain&mdash;a paro|dox which, I think, mu&s;t be utterly inconceiva|ble to every other human under&s;tanding. Brim|ful, however, of this conceit, he throws down his gauntlet, and offers this challenge; leaving his readers to &s;tare a convenient time, and to he|&s;itate, which they &s;hould admire mo&s;t&mdash;the ab|&s;urdity of taking this point for granted&mdash;or, the <HI>fortitude of face</HI> that could advance &s;uch a paro|dox.</P>
<P>I think it no difficult matter to point out many advantages which will certainly attend our recon|ciliation and connection with Great-Britain, on a firm, con&s;titutional plan. I &s;hall &s;elect a few of the&s;e; and that their importance may be more clearly di&s;cerned, I &s;hall afterwards point out &s;ome of the evils which inevitably mu&s;t attend our &s;e|parating from Britain, and declaring for indepen|dency. On each article I &s;hall &s;tudy brevity.</P>
<P N="1">1. By a reconciliation with Britain, a period would be put to the pre&s;ent calamitous war, by which &s;o many lives have been lo&s;t, and &s;o many more mu&s;t be lo&s;t, if it continues. This alone is an advantage devoutly to be wi&s;hed for. This author &s;ays&mdash;"The blood of the &s;lain, the weep|ing voice of nature cries, 'Tis time to part." I think they cry ju&s;t the rever&s;e. The blood of the &s;lain, the weeping voice of nature cries&mdash;It is time to be reconciled; it is time to lay a&s;ide tho&s;e animo&s;ities which have pu&s;hed on Britons to &s;hed the blood of Britons; it is high time that tho&s;e who are connected by the endearing ties of reli|gion, kindred and country, &s;hould re&s;ume their
<PB N="61" REF="043050_0060_101CAF6876639198">
former friend&s;hip, and be united in the bond of mutual affection, as their intere&s;ts are in&s;eparably united.</P>
<P N="2">2. By a reconciliation with Great-Britain, peace&mdash;that faire&s;t offspring and gift of Heaven&mdash;will be re&s;tored. In one re&s;pect, peace is like health; we do not &s;ufficiently know its value but by its ab&s;ence. What unea&s;ine&s;s and anxiety, what evils has this &s;hort interruption of peace with the parent &s;tate, brought on the whole Briti&s;h em|pire! Let every man only con&s;ult his feelings&mdash;I except my antagoni&s;t&mdash;and it will require no great force of rhetoric, to convince him, that a removal of tho&s;e evils, and a re&s;toration of peace, would be a &s;ingular advantage and ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P N="3">3. Agriculture, commerce and indu&s;try would re&s;ume their wonted vigour. At pre&s;ent, they langui&s;h and droop, both here and in Britain; and mu&s;t continue to do &s;o, while this unhappy conte&s;t remains un&s;ettled.</P>
<P N="4">4. By a connection with Great-Britain, our trade would &s;till have the protection of the great|e&s;t naval power in the world. England has the advantage in this re&s;pect of every other &s;tate, whether of ancient or modern times. Her in&s;u|lar &s;ituation, her nur&s;eries for &s;eamen, the &s;uperi|ority of tho&s;e &s;eamen above any others&mdash;the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, to mention no other, combine to make her the fir&s;t maritime power in the univer&s;e; &s;uch exactly is the power who&s;e protection we want for our commerce. To &s;uppo&s;e, with our author, that we &s;hould have no war, were we to revolt from England, is too ab&s;urd to de&s;erve a confutation. I would ju&s;t as &s;oon &s;et about refut|ing the reveries of &s;ome brain-&s;ick enthu&s;ia&s;t.
<PB N="62" REF="043050_0061_101CAF6C054BF8E8">
Pa&s;t experience &s;hews that Britain is able to de|fend our commerce, and our coa&s;ts; and we have no rea&s;on to doubt of her being able to do &s;o for the future.</P>
<P N="5">5. The protection of our trade, while con|nected with Britain, will not co&s;t us a fiftieth part of what it mu&s;t co&s;t, were we our&s;elves to rai&s;e a naval force &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. Whil&s;t connected with Great-Britain, we have a bounty on almo&s;t every article of exporta|tion; and we may be better &s;upplied with goods by her, than we could el&s;ewhere. What our author &s;ays is true&mdash;"That our imported goods mu&s;t be paid for, buy them where we will;" but we may buy them dearer, and of wor&s;e quality, in one place than another. The manufactures of Great-Britain confe&s;&s;edly &s;urpa&s;s any in the world&mdash;particularly tho&s;e in every kind of metal, which we want mo&s;t; and no country can afford linens and woolens of equal quality cheaper.</P>
<P N="7">7. When a reconciliation is effected, and things return into the old channel, a few years of peace will re&s;tore every thing to its pri&s;tine &s;tate. Emi|grants will flow in as u&s;ual from the different parts of Europe. Population will advance with the &s;ame rapid progre&s;s as formerly, and our lands will ri&s;e in value.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages are not imaginary, but real. They are &s;uch as we have already experienced; and &s;uch as we may derive from a connection with Great-Britain for ages to come. Each of the&s;e might ea&s;ily be enlarged on, and others added to them; but I only mean to &s;ugge&s;t a few hints to the reader.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="043050_0062_101CAF712E8EA3E0">
Let us now, if you plea&s;e, take a view of the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion. Suppo&s;e we were to revolt from Great-Britain, declare our&s;elves inde|pendent, and &s;et up a republic of our own&mdash;what would the con&s;equences be?&mdash;I &s;tand agha&s;t at the pro&s;pect&mdash;my blood runs chill when I think of the calamities, the complicated evils that mu&s;t en&s;ue, and may be clearly fore&s;een&mdash;it is impo&s;&s;i|ble for any man to fore&s;ee them all. Our author cautiou&s;ly avoids &s;aying any thing of the incon|veniences that would attend a &s;eparation. He does not even &s;uppo&s;e that any inconvenience would attend it. Let us only declare our&s;elves independent, break loo&s;e from Great-Britain, and according to him, a paradi&s;aical &s;tate will fol|low! But a prudent man will con&s;ider and weigh matters well before he con&s;ents to &s;uch a mea|&s;ure&mdash;when on the brink of &s;uch a dreadful pre|cipice, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily recoil, and think of the con&s;equences, before he advances a &s;tep for|ward. Suppo&s;ing then we declared for indepen|dency, what would follow?&mdash;I an&s;wer&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. All property throughout the continent would be unhinged; the greate&s;t confu&s;ion and mo&s;t vio|lent convul&s;ions would take place. It would not be here, as it was in England at the revolution in 1688. That revolution was not brought about by any defeazance or di&s;annulling of the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. James, by abdicating the throne, left it vacant for the next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; according|ly his elde&s;t daughter and her hu&s;band &s;tept in. Every other matter went on in the u&s;ual, regular way; and the con&s;titution, in&s;tead of being di&s;|&s;olved, was &s;trengthened. But in ca&s;e of our re|volt, the old con&s;titution would be totally &s;ub|verted
<PB N="64" REF="043050_0063_101CAF747B1FD188">
The common bond that tied us together, and by which our property was &s;ecured, would be &s;napt a&s;under. It is not to be doubted but our Congre&s;s would endeavour to apply &s;ome re|medy for tho&s;e evils; but with all deference to that re&s;pectable body, I do not apprehend that any remedy in their power would be adequate, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time. I do not chu&s;e to be more explicit; but I am able to &s;upport my opinion.</P>
<P N="2">2. What a horrid &s;ituation would thou&s;ands be reduced to, who have taken the oath of allegi|ance to the king; yet contrary to their oath, as well as inclination, mu&s;t be compelled to renounce that allegiance, or abandon all their property in America! How many thou&s;ands more would be reduced to a &s;imilar &s;ituation; who, altho' they took not the oath, yet would think it incon&s;i&s;tent with their duty, and a good con&s;cience, to re|nounce their &s;overeign! I dare &s;ay the&s;e will ap|pear trifling difficulties to our author; but what|ever he may think, there are thou&s;ands and thou|&s;ands who would &s;ooner lo&s;e all they had in the world, nay, life it&s;elf, than thus wound their con&s;cience.</P>
<P N="3">3. By a declaration for independency, every avenue to an accommodation with Great-Britain would be clo&s;ed; the &s;word only could then de|cide the quarrel; and the &s;word would not be &s;heathed till one had conquered the other. The importance of the&s;e colonies to Britain need not be enlarged on, it is a thing &s;o univer&s;ally known. The greater their importance is to her, &s;o much the more ob&s;tinate will her &s;truggle be, not to lo&s;e them. The independency of America would, in the end, deprive her of the We&s;t-Indies, &s;hake
<PB N="65" REF="043050_0064_101CAF76AE3D8640">
her empire to the foundation, and reduce her to a &s;tate of the mo&s;t mortifying in&s;ignificance. Great-Britain therefore mu&s;t, for her own pre|&s;ervation, ri&s;que every thing, and exert her whole &s;trength, to prevent &s;uch an event from taking place. This being the ca&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P N="4">4. Deva&s;tation and ruin mu&s;t mark the pro|gre&s;s of this war along the &s;ea-coa&s;t of America. Hitherto, Britain has not exerted her power. Her number of troops and &s;hips of war, here at pre&s;ent, is very little more than &s;he judged expe|dient in time of peace&mdash;the former does not a|mount to 12,000 men&mdash;nor the latter to 40 &s;hips, in|cluding frigates. Both &s;he, and the colonies, hoped for, and expected an accommodation; neither of them has lo&s;t &s;ight of that de&s;irable ob|ject. The &s;eas have been open to our &s;hips; and altho' &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes have unfortunately hap|pened, yet a ray of hope &s;till chear'd both &s;ides, that peace was not di&s;tant. But as &s;oon as we de|clare for independency, every pro&s;pect of this kind mu&s;t vani&s;h. Ruthle&s;s war, with all its aggra|vated horrors, will ravage our once happy land; our &s;ea-coa&s;ts and ports will be ruined, and our &s;hips taken. Torrents of blood will be &s;pilt, and thou&s;ands reduced to beggary and wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>This melancholy conte&s;t would fa&s;t till one &s;ide conquered. Suppo&s;ing Britain to be victorious; however high my opinion is of Briti&s;h genero&s;ity, I &s;hould be exceedingly &s;orry to receive terms from her in the haughty tone of a conqueror. Or &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a failure of her manufactures, commerce and &s;trength, that victory &s;hould in|cline to the &s;ide of America; yet who can &s;ay in that ca&s;e, what extremities her &s;en&s;e of re|&s;entiment
<PB N="66" REF="043050_0065_101CAF7B9DAC6F80">
and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation will drive Great-Britain to? For my part, I &s;hould not in the lea&s;t be &s;urpri&s;ed, if, on &s;uch a pro&s;pect as the independency of America, &s;he would parcel out this continent to the different European powers. Canada might be re&s;tored to France, Florida to Spain, with additions to each&mdash;other &s;tates al&s;o might come in for a portion. Let no man think this chimerical or improbable. The independen|cy of America would be &s;o fatal to Britain, that &s;he would leave nothing in her power undone to prevent it. I believe as firmly as I do my own exi&s;tence, that if every other method failed, &s;he would try &s;ome &s;uch expedient as this, to di&s;|concert our &s;cheme of independency; and let any man figure to him&s;elf the &s;ituation of the&s;e Bri|ti&s;h colonies, if only Canada were re&s;tored to France!</P>
<P N="5">5. But &s;uppo&s;ing, once more, that we were able to cut off every regiment that Britain can &s;pare or hire, and to de&s;troy every &s;hip &s;he can &s;end&mdash;that we could beat off any other European power that would pre&s;ume to intrude upon this continent; yet a republican form of government, would nei|ther &s;uit the genius of the people, nor the extent of America.</P>
<P>In nothing is the wi&s;dom of a legi&s;lator more con&s;picuous than in adapting his form of govern|ment to the genius, manners, di&s;po&s;ition, and other circum&s;tances of the people with whom he is concerned. If this important point is over|looked, confu&s;ion will en&s;ue; his &s;y&s;tem will &s;ink into neglect and ruin. Whatever checks or bar|riers may be interpo&s;ed, nature will always &s;ur|mount them, and finally prevail. It was chiefly
<PB N="67" REF="043050_0066_101CAF7D319A8838">
by attention to this circum&s;tance, that Lycurgus and Solon were &s;o much celebrated; and that their re&s;pective republics ro&s;e afterwards to &s;uch eminence, and acquired &s;uch &s;tability.</P>
<P>The Americans are properly Britons. They have the manners, habits, and ideas of Britons; and have been accu&s;tomed to a &s;imilar form of government. But Britons never could bear the extremes, either of monarchy or republicani&s;m. Some of their kings have aimed at de&s;poti&s;m; but always failed. Repeated efforts have been made towards democracy, and they equally failed. Once indeed republicani&s;m triumphed over the con&s;titution; the de&s;poti&s;m of one per&s;on en&s;ued; both were finally expelled. If we may judge of future events by pa&s;t tran&s;actions, in &s;imilar cir|cum&s;tances, this would mo&s;t probably be the ca&s;e of America, were a republican form of govern|ment adopted in our pre&s;ent ferment. After much blood was &s;hed, tho&s;e confu&s;ions would ter|minate in the de&s;poti&s;m of &s;ome one &s;ucce&s;sful adventurer; and &s;hould the Americans be &s;o for|tunate as to emancipate them&s;elves from that thraldom, perhaps the whole would end in a li|mited monarchy, after &s;hedding as much more blood. Limited monarchy is the form of govern|ment which is mo&s;t favourable to liberty&mdash;which is be&s;t adapted to the genius and temper of Bri|tons; altho' here and there among us a crack|brained zealot for democracy, or ab&s;olute mo|narchy, may be &s;ometimes found.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the u&s;uitablene&s;s of the republican form to the genius of the people, America is too ex|ten&s;ive for it. That form may do well enough for a &s;ingle city, or &s;mall territory; but would be
<PB N="68" REF="043050_0067_101CAF805FA39430">
utterly improper for &s;uch a continent as this. A|merica is too unwieldy for the feeble, dilatory admini&s;tration of democracy. Rome had the mo&s;t exten&s;ive dominions of any ancient repub|lic. But it &s;hould be remembered, that very &s;oon after the &s;pirit of conque&s;t carried the Ro|mans beyond the limits that were proportioned to their con&s;titution, they fell under a de&s;potic yoke. A very few years had elap&s;ed from the time of their conquering Greece, and fir&s;t entering A&s;ia, till the battle of Phar&s;alia, where Julius Cae&s;ar put an end to the liberties of his country. Cae&s;ar him&s;elf was the fir&s;t who entirely &s;ubdued the Gauls, though near neighbours, and that pene|trated into Britain. Had it not been for the ri|val&s;hip between Sylla and Marius, who were a check upon each other, Rome had &s;urrendered her liberties before, to one or other of tho&s;e tyrants. Holland is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable republic in Eu|rope at pre&s;ent; yet the &s;mall kingdom of Ire|land is more than twice as large as the Seven United Provinces. Holland, indeed, has con&s;iderable colonies in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies; but the&s;e are under as rigid and arbitrary an admini&s;tration as any colonies of France or Spain.</P>

It is as much in the democratic &s;tyle as the Rota; and as improper for America, as the other was for England.

<P N="6">6. In fine. Let us for a moment imagine that an American republic is formed, every ob&s;tacle having been &s;urmounted; yet a very &s;erious arti|cle &s;till remains to be inquired into, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the ex|pence nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport it. It behoves tho&s;e who have any property, to think of this part of the bu&s;ine&s;s. As for our author, it is more than probable he has nothing to lo&s;e; and like others in the &s;ame predicament, is willing to tru&s;t to the chapter of accidents and chances for &s;omething in the &s;cramble. He cannot lo&s;e; but may po&s;&s;i|bly gain.

<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain with preci|&s;ion the expence that would be nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of this new republic. It would be very great undoubtedly&mdash;it would appear intolerable to the Americans, who have hitherto paid &s;o few taxes. I &s;hall ju&s;t hint at a few articles.&mdash;</P>

Our author a&s;&s;erts the nece&s;&s;ity of our having a naval force, when independent. It is granted&mdash;we could not be without one. The reader, how|ever, will not expect that I &s;hould either adopt, or formally refute his hopeful &s;cheme, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That merchant &s;hips armed &s;hall be employed for our de|fence&mdash;that is to &s;ay&mdash;that &s;hips when on trading voyages to Europe, Africa, the Ea&s;tor We&s;t-Indies, or taking in their ladings at that tho&s;e places, &s;hall defend the trade and coa&s;ts of America! "This," he &s;ays, "would be uniting the &s;inews of com|merce and defence, and making our &s;trength and riches play into each others hands." The thought I verily believe is original, and the plan entirely his own&mdash;it might intitle him to a di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;eat among the &s;age profe&s;&s;ors of Laputa, who, according to Swift, were employed in <Q>extract|ing &s;un beams out of cucumbers, calcining ice into gun powder, and making fire malleable,</Q> with other &s;uch ingenious inventions.</P>
<P>This gentleman thinks, that "fifty or &s;ixty &s;hips, mounting 20, 30, 40, or 50 guns, with a few guard &s;hips, would keep up a &s;ufficient navy." Let us take a medium of tho&s;e numbers, and &s;uppo&s;e the American navy to con&s;i&s;t of fifty-five &s;hips, each mounting fifty guns; which would be a very moderate navy indeed for this conti|nent. In England the general calculation of ex|pence in building &s;hips of war, is, that when fitted for actual &s;ervice, with &s;ix months pay and provi&s;ions, one thou&s;and pounds &s;terling are ex|pended for each gun. According to this calcu|lation, the building and fitting out the above navy, would co&s;t &pound;.2,750,000 &s;terling; i. e. two milli|ons, &s;even hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds, &s;ter|ling money; which is nearly equal to 12,222,222
<PB N="71" REF="043050_0070_101CAF8A579283F0">
dollars; i. e. twelve millions, two hundred and twenty-two thou&s;and, two hundred and twen|ty-two Spani&s;h dollars, reckoning each dollar: at 4s. 6d. &s;terling. If the above calculation &s;hould be deemed too large, as I am not certain but it may, &s;ince the preci&s;e co&s;t of building a fifty gun &s;hip is &pound;.14,200 &s;terling: Yet, con&s;idering the high price of labour in America&mdash;the docks, ar&s;e|nals, armories, foundries, &amp;c. &amp;c. which are previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary towards keeping up a regular naval force, and are all very expen&s;ive; I am per&s;uaded the expence of fitting out this fleet would not fall &s;hort of the &s;um I have menti|oned.</P>
<P>The annual expence is next to be con&s;idered. The certain annual expence of a fifty gun &s;hip in England, and for which provi&s;ion is made by government, amounts to &pound;.18,200 &s;terling. This is allowed for wear and tear, victualling and wages. Repairs and expence of amunition are another article, which as it cannot be a&s;certained, I &s;hall pa&s;s over. The American fleet, con&s;i&s;t|ing of 55 &s;hips, each mounting 50 guns, would therefore be a certain annual expence of &pound;.1,001,000 &s;terling; i. e. one million, one thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering our exten&s;ive line of &s;ea coa&s;t, and our no le&s;s exten&s;ive frontier, along which &s;o ma|ny thou&s;ands of &s;avages are &s;ettled, I think Ame|rica, when independent, cannot keep le&s;s than fourteen thou&s;and land forces in con&s;tant pay; that is 20 regiments of 700 men each. The &s;mall republic of Holland has 40,000 land forces in time of peace, one half of which is employed in gari&s;ons. The annual expence of an Engli&s;h
<PB N="72" REF="043050_0071_101CAF8F83033D80">
regiment, con&s;i&s;ting of 700 privates, is nearly &pound;.15,743 &s;terling; and the expence of rai&s;ing arming, &amp;c. of a regiment is about &pound;.6 a man. i. e. &pound;.4,200 for a regiment. Thus the annual expence of 14,000 men, or 20 regiments of 700 men each, would be &pound;.314,860 &s;terling. Be&s;ides the charge of arming, &amp;c. tho&s;e 20 regi|ments, which amounts to &pound;.84,000 &s;terl. Moreo|ver, we &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary, to have three or four regiments of cavalry, to be di&s;tributed in or near the large towns or cities. Let us &s;uppo&s;e three regiments to be rai&s;ed, of 300 privates each. The annual expence of an Engli&s;h regi|ment of dragoons, of three hundred men, is nearly &pound;.16,137 &s;terling. The annual expence of three &s;uch regiments, would be &pound;.48,561 &s;terling, be&s;ides the charge of hor&s;es, arming, &amp;c. which is computed at 30 guineas per man, and will a|mount to &pound;.28,350 &s;terling.</P>

<P>The civil department &s;till remains; and after con&s;idering it with as much exactne&s;s as the na|ture of the ca&s;e will admit, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to aver, that when this is added to the two former, the annual expence of America, after &s;he be|comes independent, will at lea&s;t amount to &pound;.1,500,000 &s;terling, i. e. one million, five hun|dred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling money; which is

nearly equal to 6,666,666 dollars; i. e. &s;ix mil|lions, &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix thou&s;and, &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix dollars.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing, then, that Canada, Nova-Scotia and Florida, were joined to the thirteen colonies now united, the number would be &s;ixteen. The above &s;um equally divided among&s;t them, would be about &pound;.93,750 &s;terl. nearly equal to 416,666 dollars, annual expence to each colony. But it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that Rhode I&s;land is a &s;mall colony&mdash;that the three counties of New-Ca&s;tle, Kent and Su&s;&s;ex on Delaware, are reckoned as a colony&mdash;that Nova-Scotia, Georgia and Florida are very young colonies; none of the&s;e, therefore, could po&s;&s;ibly contribute an equal &s;hare with the older and larger colonies; the expence of the lat|ter mu&s;t therefore be proportionably greater to make up the deficiency.</P>

<P><PB N="74" REF="043050_0073_101CAF985F41ADB0">
I have not knowingly exaggerated a &s;ingle ar|ticle in the above e&s;timate; and were the trial to be made, I verily believe the expence would be found much greater. For I have formed this e&s;timate according to the &s;tate of things in Eng|land; but it is well known, that wages, and the price of labour in general, are much greater in America than in England. Labour nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t be dear in every country where land is cheap, and large tracts of it un&s;ettled, as is the ca&s;e here. Hence, an American regiment co&s;ts us more than <HI>double</HI> what a Briti&s;h regiment, of equal number, co&s;ts Britain. Were it proper to be explicit, and de&s;cend to particulars, I could evince this pa&s;t all po&s;&s;ibility of doubt; and I appeal for the truth of it to tho&s;e gentlemen among us who are ac|quainted with the&s;e matters.</P>
<P>Where the money is to come from, which will defray this enormous expence of a million and a half &s;terling annually, I know not. The whole of our exports from the thirteen united colonies in the year 1769, amounted only to &pound;.2,887,898 &s;terling,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Campoell Political Survey of Great Britain, Vol. 2.</NOTE> which is not twice as much as our an|nual expence would be, in ca&s;e we were indepen|dent of Great-Britain. Tho&s;e exports, with no incon&s;iderable part of the profits ari&s;ing from them, it is well known, centered finally in Bri|tain, to pay the merchants and manufacturers there for goods we had imported thence; and yet left us &s;till in debt. What then mu&s;t our &s;ituation be, or what the &s;tate of our trade, when oppre&s;|&s;ed with &s;uch a load of annual expence! When every article of commerce, every nece&s;&s;ary of
<PB N="75" REF="043050_0074_101CAF99ED9B00C8">
life, together with our lands, mu&s;t be taxed to defray that expence!</P>
<P>Such is the debt and expence we &s;hould incur by this writer's hopeful exchange of our pre&s;ent connection with Great-Britain for independency and republicani&s;m! And all this after being ex|hau&s;ted by a tedious war, and perhaps all our &s;hipping and &s;ea ports de&s;troyed! How little do tho&s;e who de&s;ire &s;uch an exchange, know what they are about, or what they de&s;ire!</P>
<P>Our author frequently refers us to Holland, as if that were the only land of liberty&mdash;crowned with every ble&s;&s;ing, and exempt from every evil. But hear a little plain truth. The national debt of Holland is much greater, in proportion, than that of England. The taxes in Holland far ex|ceed not only tho&s;e in England, but even tho&s;e in France; in&s;omuch, that a certain writer declares, he &s;carcely knows any thing they have, which has e&s;caped taxation, "except the air they breathe." Nay more&mdash;the people at large have no voice in chu&s;ing the members of their &s;everal &s;enates, as we have in chu&s;ing repre&s;entatives. The members of each &s;enate, upon any vacancy, elect new members; and the deputies from tho&s;e &s;enates, con&s;titute the States General. So that in fact, the people have no &s;hare in the government, as with us; "They have nothing to do but pay and grumble," as Lord Che&s;terfield ob&s;erves. Yet this is the country our author holds up for imita|tion; and if we were to follow his advice, I have not the lea&s;t doubt but we &s;hould &s;oon re&s;emble them in paying heavy taxes, as well as in other matters.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="043050_0075_101CAF9B7AE8F2A8">
But here it may be &s;aid&mdash;"that all the evils above &s;pecified, are more tolerable than &s;lavery." With this &s;entiment I &s;incerely agree&mdash;any hard|&s;hips, however great, are preferable to &s;lavery. But then I a&s;k, is there no other alternative in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e? Is there no choice left us but &s;lavery, or tho&s;e evils? I think there is; and that both may be equally avoided. Let us only &s;hew a di&s;|po&s;ition to treat or negociate in earne&s;t&mdash;let us fall upon &s;ome method to &s;et a treaty or negociation with Great-Britain on foot; and if once properly begun, there is a moral certainty that this unhap|py di&s;pute will be &s;ettled to the mutual &s;atisfaction and intere&s;t of both countries. For my part, I have not the lea&s;t doubt about it.</P>
<P>It would be improper and needle&s;s for me to enlarge on the particulars that &s;hould be adju&s;ted at &s;uch a treaty. The mature&s;t deliberation will be nece&s;&s;ary on the occa&s;ion, as well as a generous regard to every part of the empire. I &s;hall ju&s;t beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t my opinion on a few points.&mdash;I think America &s;hould in&s;i&s;t, that the claim of Parliamentary taxation be either explicitly re|linqui&s;hed, or el&s;e &s;uch &s;ecurity given as the ca&s;e will admit, and may be equivalent to a formal relinqui&s;hment, that this claim &s;hall not be exert|ed. When this mo&s;t important point is gained, America &s;hould con&s;ider, that there is a great difference between having her money wre&s;ted from her by others, and not giving any of it her&s;elf, when it is proper to give. While &s;he is protected, and &s;hares in the advantages re&s;ulting from being a part of the Briti&s;h empire, &s;he &s;hould contri|bute &s;omething for that protection and tho&s;e ad|vantages; and I never heard a &s;en&s;ible American
<PB N="77" REF="043050_0076_101CAF9D2AA4C368">
deny this. Moreover, &s;he &s;hould &s;tipulate for &s;uch a freedom of trade as is con&s;i&s;tent with the general welfare of the &s;tate; and that this inte|re&s;ting object be &s;ettled in &s;uch a manner as to preclude as much as po&s;&s;ible any impolitic, or in|jurious infringements hereafter. All this may be ea&s;ily done, if both &s;ides are only di&s;po&s;ed for peace; and there are many other particulars which would be exceedingly beneficial to America, and might be obtained, as they could not interfere with the intere&s;t of Great-Britain, or any other part of the empire.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked&mdash;What probability is there that Britain will enter on &s;uch a treaty, or li&s;ten to propo&s;als of this kind? Is &s;he not preparing for war, and fitting out a formidable armament again&s;t the colonies? I an&s;wer&mdash;there is every rea&s;on to believe that &s;he will enter on &s;uch a treaty if it is de&s;ired; and that &s;he will li&s;ten to rea&s;onable propo&s;als. It is her intere&s;t to do &s;o. To hold the&s;e colonies by the &s;word only, were &s;he ever &s;o powerful, would be hold|ing them by a very precarious, expen&s;ive tenure. Such an union with the colonies as will promote their intere&s;ts equally with her's, is the only ef|fectual way of attaching them to her. Is it rea|&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that Great-Britain does not &s;ee this? Or that &s;he is not &s;en&s;ible of it? Be&s;ides, it has been openly and expre&s;&s;ly declared in Par|liament, that "taxation is given up" by the mi|ni&s;try; and we are a&s;&s;ured that &s;ome very re&s;pec|table names have been lately added to the advo|cates of America. All the&s;e things are in our favour, and promi&s;e a pro&s;perous i&s;&s;ue to a nego|ciation, if once begun. The Briti&s;h armament
<PB N="78" REF="043050_0077_101CAFA6004F1DE8">
will not in the lea&s;t impede a treaty. Belligerent powers, when on the eve of peace, always make vigorous preparations for war, as if there were no thoughts of peace. America is al&s;o preparing for war, which is no more than a prudent &s;tep. It need not prevent her from treating; and &s;he may thereby obtain better terms.</P>
<P>But a declaration for independency on the part of America, would preclude the treaty entirely; and could an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e. We actual|ly have already every advantage of independency, without its inconveniences. By a declaration of independency, we &s;hould in&s;tantly lo&s;e all a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from our friends in England. It would &s;top their mouths; for were they to &s;ay any thing in our favour, they would be deemed rebels, and treated accordingly.</P>
<P>Our author is much elated with the pro&s;pect of foreign &s;uccour, if we once declare our&s;elves independent; and from thence promi&s;eth us mighty matters. This, no doubt, is intended to &s;pirit up the de&s;ponding&mdash;all who might &s;hrink at the thought of America encountering, &s;ingly and un&s;upported, the whole &s;trength of Great-Britain. I believe in my con&s;cience, that he is as much mi&s;taken in this, as in any thing el&s;e; and that this expectation is delu&s;ive, vain and fal|lacious. My rea&s;ons are the&s;e, and I &s;ubmit them to the reader's judgment.</P>
<P>The only European power from which we can receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance is France. But France is now at peace with Great-Britain; and is it probable that France would interrupt that peace, and hazard a war with the power which lately redu|ced her &s;o low, from a di&s;intere&s;ted motive of
<PB N="79" REF="043050_0078_101CAFA78E387CD8">
aiding and protecting the&s;e colonies? The fate of Cor&s;ica may teach us how ready European &s;tates are to act on di&s;intere&s;ted motives, in &s;uch ca&s;es. France has now a pacific king; &s;he is burthened with an enormous national debt; both which circum&s;tances will naturally tend to keep her quiet. If it be &s;aid&mdash;That the exclu&s;ive trade of America would be a &s;ufficient induce|ment for France to engage on our &s;ide,&mdash;I an|&s;wer&mdash;That &s;he never can have our exclu&s;ive trade, till the power of Great-Britain is totally annihi|lated. Now, &s;uppo&s;ing France were able to ef|fect this&mdash;(a &s;uppo&s;ition not very probable)&mdash;yet the other European &s;tates are too jealous of her&mdash;too deeply intere&s;ted in pre&s;erving a due balance of power, which is a principal object in European politics, ever to &s;uffer &s;uch an event to take place.</P>
<P>It is well known that &s;ome of the French co|loni&s;ts, not long &s;ince, offered to put them&s;elves under the protection of England, and declare them|&s;elves independant of France; but England re|jected the offer. The example would be rather dangerous to &s;tates that have colonies&mdash;to none could it be more &s;o than to France and Spain, who have &s;o many and &s;uch exten&s;ive colonies. The practice of courts is as much again&s;t us in this, as in the in&s;tance our author mentions. Can any one imagine, that becau&s;e we declared our|&s;elves independent of England, France would therefore con&s;ider us as really independant? And before England had aquie&s;ced, or made any ef|forts worth mentioning to reduce us? Or can any one be &s;o weak as to think, that France would run the ri&s;k of a war with England, un|le&s;s
<PB N="80" REF="043050_0079_101CAFA922CEB4A0">
&s;he (France) were &s;ure of &s;ome extraordinary advantage by it, in having the colonies under her immediate juri&s;diction? If England will not protect us for our trade, &s;urely France will not. In truth, France need not hazard a war to have her purpo&s;es an&s;wered with re&s;pect to America, if we &s;hould be &s;o infatuated as to declare for independency. I am confident, that in le&s;s than &s;ix months, after &s;uch a declaration, France would be put in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Canada.</P>
<P>Indeed, were France ever &s;o willing and able to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, the experiment would be imprudent and hazardous in the highe&s;t degree. There is &s;carcely an in&s;tance recorded in hi&s;tory of foreign|ers being called in to a&s;&s;i&s;t in dome&s;tic quarrels, that it did not prove ruinous to tho&s;e that &s;ought their aid. The ancient Britons invited the Saxons to a&s;&s;i&s;t them again&s;t the Picts&mdash;the Picts were &s;ubdued and the Britons en&s;laved. One in&s;tance more I cannot forbear mentioning. The Eto|lians and other Greek &s;tates, called in the Ro|mans to a&s;&s;i&s;t them again&s;t Philip of Macedon, one of Alexander's &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Philip was reduced, and the Roman yoke was impo&s;ed on the Grecian &s;tates. Sen&s;ible of their error, when it was too late, and anxious for deliverance from the Romans, the Etolians applied for aid to Antiochus, who then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the remains of Alexander's A&s;iatic dominions. The Romans now employed Philip to &s;ubdue Antiochus and the Etolians, as before they employed the Etoli|ans to &s;ubdue Philip. The Roman yoke was more confirmed and made heavier. Thus were the French and coloni&s;ts to &s;ucceed again&s;t Bri|tain in the pre&s;ent &s;truggle, the French might
<PB N="81" REF="043050_0080_101CAFAAB573EA08">
hereafter employ the coloni&s;ts to &s;ubdue Britain.</P>
<P>I have heard the ca&s;e of Holland's revolt from Spain, and Queen Elizabeth's affording aid to the former, mentioned as parallel to ours. But in&s;tead of being parallel, the ca&s;es differ in every cicrum&s;tance. Elizabeth, embarra&s;&s;ed great|ly by Roman catholics at home, was then at war with Philip II. of Spain&mdash;a cruel, gloomy tyrant, who had lately introduced the inqui&s;ition into the Low Countries, where hundreds of his Pro|te&s;tant &s;ubjects were &s;acrificed by that bloody court. This was the real cau&s;e of the Dutch revolt; though civil matters partly mingled with it. Elizabeth, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Dutch, &s;erved two important purpo&s;es. One was to protect the Pro|te&s;tants, who were every where threatened with de&s;truction. The other was to di&s;tre&s;s her im|placable enemy, who aimed at no le&s;s than the utter ruin of her religion, crown and kingdom. The Dutch States offered Elizabeth the &s;overeignty of their country; but &s;he refu&s;ed it, having no de&s;ign of that fort. It is more than probable, the French King would not be &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted, mode&s;t and &s;elf-denying as Elizabeth was, were we to make him the like offer. Such was the ca&s;e of Holland; yet &s;ome have been &s;o &s;illy as to com|pare our pre&s;ent ca&s;e to that of the Dutch.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider this matter as you will, view the de|claration of independency in what light you plea&s;e, the ruin of America mu&s;t be the inevitable con&s;e|quence. Our author's earne&s;tne&s;s and zeal, there|fore, that we &s;hould declare our&s;elves independent, &s;erves only to prove, that he him&s;elf is de&s;perate; and that he would gladly bring this whole conti|nent into the &s;ame &s;ituation.</P>

But our author repeatedly tells us, "That to expend millions for the &s;ake of getting a few vile acts repealed, is unworthy of the charge." Now, to pa&s;s over the gro&s;s in&s;ult here offered to the Continental Congre&s;s, who had this important object principally in view, in the &s;pirited mea&s;ures they have taken; I an&s;wer&mdash;That if five times as many millions had been expended, America would be an immen&s;e gainer, provided tho&s;e acts are repealed, and her liberties, property and trade are &s;ettled on a firm ba&s;is, by a con&s;titutional union with Great-Britain. Were that mea&s;ure once effected, the peace and pro&s;perity of this continent would be as immutably and certainly &s;ecured as any thing in this world can. The Ame|ricans have fully evinced, to the conviction of the mo&s;t incredulous, that they have an high &s;en&s;e of their liberties, and &s;ufficient &s;pirit to vindicate tho&s;e liberties. Their numbers, &s;trength and importance will be daily increa&s;ing; the&s;e will command re&s;pect from Great-Britain, and in&s;ure to them a mild and equitable treatment from her. She will not hereafter be over anxious to contend, or come to blows with them. This, I think, is clear to demon&s;tration; and hence we may learn to &s;et a proper value on the rant which this author throws out, as if America would be perpetually embroiled with England hereafter, unle&s;s we declare for independency.</P>
<P>For my part, I look upon this pamphlet to be the mo&s;t injurious, in every re&s;pect, to America, of any that has appeared &s;ince the&s;e troubles began. The Continental Congre&s;s, the &s;everal Provincial Congre&s;&s;es, and A&s;&s;emblies, have all unanimou&s;ly and in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, di&s;claimed every idea
<PB N="83" REF="043050_0082_101CAFB5DB67FDC0">
of independency. They have repeatedly de|clared their abhorrence of &s;uch a &s;tep; they have as often declared their firm attachment to our &s;o|vereign and the parent &s;tate. They have declar|ed, that placing them in the &s;ame &s;ituation that they were at the clo&s;e of the la&s;t war, was their only object; that when this was done, by repeal|ing the obnoxious acts, our former harmony and friend&s;hip would be re&s;tored. I appeal to the reader whether all this has not been done from one end of the continent to the other.</P>
<P>Yet here &s;teps forth a writer, who avers with as much a&s;&s;urance as if he had the whole conti|nent at his back, and ready to &s;upport his a&s;&s;eve|rations&mdash;That independency is our duty and inte|re&s;t&mdash;That it was folly and ra&s;hne&s;s to go to the expence we have been at for the &s;ake of repeal|ing tho&s;e obnoxious acts; and moreover, loads with the mo&s;t approbrious terms, that &s;overeign and nation to which we had declared our attach|ment! In what light can this be viewed in Britain? Mu&s;t it not weaken the influence of our friends&mdash;&s;trengthen the hands of the mini&s;try&mdash;and give weight to every thing our enemies have &s;aid to our di&s;advantage? Mu&s;t it not induce people to &s;u&s;pect our candour&mdash;that all our declarations were in&s;incere, fallacious&mdash;intended only to amu&s;e and deceive?&mdash;It is as much to vindicate my injured countrymen from this di&s;grace, which they de&s;erve not, as to oppo&s;e the de&s;tructive project of inde|pendency, that I appear on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have now con&s;idered every thing in this in|cendiary's pamphlet, that de&s;erves notice. If &s;ome things are pa&s;&s;ed over, it is not becau&s;e they are unan&s;werable; but becau&s;e they are not
<PB N="84" REF="043050_0083_101CAFB925A57768">
worthy of an an&s;wer. I have on purpo&s;e omitted every &s;ubject, the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which might tend to rai&s;e jealou&s;y among the coloni&s;ts; &s;uch as re|ligion, the claims of &s;ome colonies on others, be&s;ides many more of the &s;ame kind. But it was more difficult to avoid &s;peaking of the&s;e, than to point out what prolific &s;ources of animo&s;ity, bit|terne&s;s, and bloody conte&s;ts they mu&s;t infallibly prove, were America to become independent. The whole is freely &s;ubmitted to the reader's can|did, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate judgment.</P>
<P>The author of Common Sen&s;e may probably call me "a di&s;gui&s;ed tory, a prejudi&s;ed man," or what in his e&s;timation "will be productive of more calamities to this continent than all others&mdash;a moderate man." But I am too con&s;cious of the &s;incerity of my own heart, and of the recti|tude of my intentions, to pay any regard to what|ever he is plea&s;ed to call me. Who indeed would be ambitious of his approbation, when he ex|pre&s;sly reprobates moderation&mdash;that offspring of true wi&s;dom and &s;ound judgment? The welfare of America is what I wi&s;h for above any earthly thing. I am fully, firmly, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly per&s;uaded, that in a reconciliation and union with Great-Britain, on con&s;titutional principles, the welfare of America is only to be found. I am fully, firmly, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly per&s;uaded, that our author's &s;cheme of independency and repub|licani&s;m is big with ruin&mdash;with inevitable ruin to America. Again&s;t this &s;cheme, therefore, as an hone&s;t man, as a friend to human nature, I mu&s;t and will bear te&s;timony.</P>
<P>Let the &s;pirit, de&s;ign and motives which are undeniably evident in our re&s;pective pamphlets, decide which &s;hould be attended to mo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="043050_0084_101CAFBAB4CB9C18">
The author of Common Sen&s;e is a violent &s;trickler for democracy or republicani&s;m only&mdash;every other &s;pecies of government is reprobated by him as tyrannical. I plead for that con&s;titu|tion which has been formed by the wi&s;dom of ages&mdash;is the admiration of mankind&mdash;is be&s;t a|dapted to the genius of Britons, and is mo&s;t friendly to liberty</P>
<P>HE takes plea&s;ure in aggravating every cir|cum&s;tance of our unhappy di&s;pute&mdash;would in|&s;pire others with the &s;ame rage that in&s;tigates him&s;elf, and would &s;et his fellow-&s;ubjects to cut|ting each others throats: I would mo&s;t gladly, were it in my power, draw a veil of eternal obli|vion over any errors which Great-Britain or the colonies may have fallen into&mdash;I would willingly per&s;eade them to mutual harmony and union; &s;ince on the&s;e their mutual happine&s;s and intere&s;t depend.</P>
<P>HE is evidently goaded on by ambition and re&s;entment, to &s;eek for the gratification of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions in an independent republic here; which would reduce America to the &s;ame de&s;perate &s;tate with him&s;elf: I have no intere&s;t to &s;erve but what is common to my countrymen&mdash;but what every Ameaican of property is concerned in equally with me.</P>
<P>HE places him&s;elf at the head of a party; and &s;purns from him with the utmo&s;t contempt and indignation, all who will not enli&s;t under his banner: I am of no party, but &s;o far as the wel|fare of America is aimed at; and I believe there are many who aim at this in every party. I have not learnt to pace with &s;uch intire acquie&s;ence in
<PB N="86" REF="043050_0085_101CAFBE13F02428">
the trammels of any party, as not to de&s;ert it the moment it de&s;erts the intere&s;t of my country.</P>
<P>This, as far as I can know or &s;ee, is the true ca&s;e&mdash;let heaven and earth judge between us.</P>
<P>America is far from being yet in a de&s;perate &s;ituation. I am confident &s;he may obtain honour|able and advantageous terms from Great-Britain. A few years of peace will &s;oon retrieve all her lo&s;&s;es. She will rapidly advance to a &s;tate of ma|turity, whereby &s;he may not only repay the pa|rent &s;tate amply for all pa&s;t benefits; but al&s;o lay it under the greate&s;t obligations. America, till very lately, has been the happie&s;t country in the univer&s;e. Ble&s;t with all that Nature could be&s;tow with the profu&s;e&s;t bounty, &s;he enjoyed, be&s;ides, more liberty, greater privileges than any other land. How painful is it to reflect on the&s;e things, and to look forward to the gloomy pro&s;pects now before us! But it is not too late to hope that matters may mend. By prudent management, her former happine&s;s may again return; and continue to encrea&s;e for ages to come, in a union with the parent fiate.</P>
<P>However di&s;tant humanity may wi&s;h the period; yet in the rotation of human affairs, a period may arrive, when, (both countries being prepared for it) &s;ome terrible di&s;a&s;ter, &s;ome dreadful con|vul&s;ion in Great-Britain, may transfer the &s;eat of empire to this we&s;tern hemi&s;phere&mdash;Where the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, like the Phoenix from its parent's a&s;hes, &s;hall ri&s;e with youthful vigour, and &s;hine with redoubled &s;plendor.</P>
<P>But if America &s;hould now mi&s;take her real intere&s;t&mdash;if her &s;ons, infatuated with romantic notions of conque&s;t and empire, ere things are
<PB N="87" REF="043050_0086_101CAFC3183D8D18">
ripe, &s;hould adopt this republican's &s;cheme: They will infalibly de&s;troy this &s;miling pro&s;pect. They will di&s;member this happy country&mdash;make it a &s;cene of blood and &s;laughter, and entail wretch|edne&s;s and mi&s;ery on millions yet unborn.</P>
