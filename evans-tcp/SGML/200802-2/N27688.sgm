<Q><BIBL><HI>ISAIAH XLV, 1, 2, 3, 4.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Thus &s;aith the <HI>LORD</HI> to his anointed, to Cyrus, who&s;e right hand I have holden, to &s;ubdue nations before him; and I will loo&s;e the loins of kings, to open before him the two-leaved gates, and the gates &s;hall not be &s;hut. I will go before thee, and make the crooked places &s;traight: I will break in pieces the gates of bra&s;s, and cut in &s;under the bars of iron. And I will give thee the trea&s;ures of darkne&s;s, and hidden riches of &s;ecret places, that thou maye&s;t know that I the <HI>LORD,</HI> which call thee by thy name, as the God of I&s;rael. For Jacob my &s;ervant's &s;ake, and I&s;rael mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name; I have &s;urnamed thee: though thou ha&s;t not known me.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS pa&s;&s;age of the word of <HI>God,</HI> carries the mind above generals, to the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who&s;e character, ability and per|fection are &s;uch, that &s;hould the compari&s;on be made, all the generals, nobles and kings of the earth, yea, and all the kingdoms of this and of all other worlds, would become as the drop of the bucket, or the unnoticed d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">t of the balance. Hence this doctrine: God is all and in all.</P>
<P>For proof of this doctrine let us con&s;ider how created exi&s;tences came into being. The LORD GOD &s;aid, let them be, and they were. This is demon&s;tration that <HI>God</HI> was all and in all in crea|tion. For further proof of the Doctrine, let us view the government of the world, here as well as in creation it will be evident that <HI>God</HI> is all and in

all. When God would have a cho&s;en people in the world, he took Abraham their ance&s;tor and carried him &s;afely through all his pilgrimage in the land, afterward to be peopled with his de&s;cendants. No enemy harmed him, for <HI>God</HI> was his &s;hield and de|fence. When five kings combined and wrought wickedne&s;s, for which <HI>God</HI> thought be&s;t to puni&s;h them, Abraham and his family were a &s;ufficient ho&s;t in the hand of Omnipotence to vanqui&s;h the combined forces, liberate their captives and recover the &s;poil they were carrying off. <HI>God</HI> was all and in all, in protecting and defending I&s;aac and Jacob with their families, while as pilgrims and &s;trangers, they &s;ojourned among their enemies. When God's people were reduced to the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery in Egypt, he rai&s;ed up Mo&s;es with all the talents, furni&s;hed with all the accompli&s;hments nece&s;&s;ary to effect what he then would have done. God with this noble in&s;trument in his hand emancipated I&s;rael, &s;poiled the Egyptains, yea, and conducted his cho&s;en nation through the &s;ea, through the wilderne&s;s within &s;ight of the promi&s;ed land. And before he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Mo&s;es, he had prepaired a more &s;uitable character to be in&s;trumental in conquering and &s;ettling Canaan in the per&s;on of Jo&s;hua. This chain of Gods in&s;trument whom he rai&s;ed up and qualified to effect tho&s;e things which were done through the periods of the Judges and Kings of I&s;real, might be traced to advantage, in &s;hewing that God is all and in all.</P>
<P>But let us now attend to proof of the doctrine con|tained in the text. The text looks to the period when I&s;rael had been nearly &s;eventy years in captivity, when God had puni&s;hed that nation for their wickedne&s;s ac|cording to his former threatenings, to the time when he had purpo&s;ed to redeem them from captivity and bring them back to Jeru&s;alem. Therefore, God prepares for him&s;elf a character exactly &s;uited to the occa&s;ion, to be the in&s;trument in this great work; yea and out of the heathen world too he makes to him&s;elf a general, furni&s;hed with all the arts of war, nece&s;&s;ary to be the in&s;trument in his hand in overturning Babylon that mighty empire, which had been mi&s;tre&s;s of the world

many years. When Cyrus laid &s;iege to the city of Babylon, &s;uch was the &s;trength and height of its walls, that the inhabitants &s;o far from being terrified at the &s;iege, made a &s;coff and deri&s;ion of the general and his army. The river Euphrates ran through the middle of Babylon, pa&s;&s;ing under the wall through arches: each &s;ide of this river, or on each bank within the city were walls of &s;imilar &s;trength to tho&s;e that &s;urrounded the city, and in tho&s;e walls at the bottom of every &s;treet were brazen gates through which the inhabitants pa&s;&s;ed to the river; the con&s;tant practice was to have the&s;e gates &s;tand open by day, and to have them &s;hut and fa&s;t barred by night. The way in which Cyrus took the city was; he turned the cour&s;e of the river above the city, cau&s;ing all the waters to leave the natural channel, then made two divi&s;ions of his army and entered the city on both &s;ides at once in the channel of the river, and pa&s;&s;ing up and down the channel, found all the brazen gates open, which gave him an opportunity to attack all parts of the city at once. Here was fulfilled the promi&s;e of God in the text, I will loo&s;e the loins of kings to open before him the two leaved gates, and the gates &s;hall not be &s;hut&mdash;I will brake in pieces the gates of bra&s;s and cut in &s;under the bars of Iron. Thus Cyrus in one night became ma&s;ter of Babylon and all her hidden trea&s;ures, he overturned the Babylonian empire, and erected the Per&s;ian. This revolution threw captive I&s;rael into the hands of the conquering General. Now look at the finger of God, and realize that he is all and in all. The iron &s;avage heart of the hero Cyrus, that ye&s;terday was bent on making all the world &s;laves to him&s;elf, to day, in the hand of God, is melted down &s;o as to &s;ay to captive I&s;rael, be free, go, return to your own land, carry with you the rich trea&s;ure brought hither from Jeru&s;alem, rebuild your temple and city; and lo! ye have al&s;o the aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of me and my &s;ubjects! What an event this! and how &s;triking a proof that God is all and in all. But for more &s;en&s;ible proof of the truth of our doctrine, we will come down to things which we have &s;een, and humbly hope we &s;hall all be feelingly convinced that God is all and in all.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="036905_0005_100B31BB994BB540">Our ance&s;tors, to enjoy peaceably their religion, left their native land, cro&s;&s;ed the untraver&s;ed ocean, under the guiding hand of God, and &s;ettled the borders of this then &s;avage land. God fought their battles with the &s;avages as our fathers tell us, and in his hand his little flock was &s;afe. Under the care of &s;uch a Shep|herd the flock &s;oon became numerous like I&s;rael of old, was great and goodly, &s;o as to be &s;een acro&s;s the broad Atlantic with a jealous and envious eye by its parent. She not like other parents, di&s;owned her child, and not only refu&s;ed to give it nouri&s;hment, but with rapacious hand, attempted to &s;natch what the infant had it&s;elf gathered for its own &s;upport. The infant held its hard acquired mor&s;el fa&s;t. What followed? The mon&s;ter, for I will no longer call her parent, drew the glittering &s;word, and &s;heathed it in the infants heart, and called it rebel. But to di&s;mi&s;s the allegory: God was about to make another nation in the world; and for materials, he cho&s;e the Briti&s;h Colonies in America, the then mo&s;t weak, and as to the arts of war mo&s;t unexperienced part of the nation, which like Babylon of old had long been the terror of the world. The whole nation be&s;ides the Colonies, not to mention the multitudes &s;cattered throughout them who did <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The conduct of tho&s;e people called tories, who at the com|mencement of the war with Britain, &s;tayed in America to inform the Briti&s;h of tho&s;e things, which would injure the American cau&s;e, and afford the enemy the be&s;t means to carry into effect their wicked purpo&s;es, may fairly be &s;aid to act a much wor&s;e part than the Briti&s;h nation.</NOTE> wor&s;e, flew to arms to cru&s;h the <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The term rebellion was altogether un&s;uitably applied in the commencement of the war. For the Americans only a&s;ked for their charter rights, and this they did too without any weapons of war in their hands. They were &s;uppliant till their blood was murderou&s;ly &s;pilled. And for a long time after they only repel|led force by force, with a view to obtain their ju&s;t rights, till Britain forced them to declare them&s;elves independent.</NOTE> rebellion, as they termed it, and bind fa&s;t in &s;laveries galling chains Americans. But it was all in vain, for God who is all and in all, was about to give birth to, perhaps, the mo&s;t important nation on earth, and he had his in&s;trument all prepared. He had his
<PB N="7" REF="036905_0006_100B31A6E9B51BD8">
General made and furni&s;hed with every talent, with every qualification nece&s;&s;ary to take the field, and at the head of &s;uch men, for we cannot with propriety &s;ay &s;oldiers, as the Colonies afforded, he baffled the councils, defeated and captured the armies, and lay pro&s;trate the pride of haughty Britain.</P>
<P>Americans, this was the work of God, who is all, and in all, and in this work WASHINGTON was his noble creature, made of God to be an in&s;trument in freeing you from the oppre&s;&s;ive tyranny of Britian's haughty Monarch. Yes, let it be realized, let it be felt in every heart that God was all and in all, in rai&s;ing up and in qualifying our beloved WASHINGTON to do this impor|tant &s;ervice for the nation. God in his providence furni&s;hed him with wi&s;e and good councillors, and with all the help he enjoyed, he did all for him, and carried him on, &s;hielding him in his hand in the crim&s;on field, and filling his mind with the whole &s;y&s;tem of tactics until as a General he &s;tood unrivalled. With WASHINGTON as the chief in&s;trument, God hath made a nation which of its age, hath not an equal. This done, the bene|volent father of mercies was plea&s;ed to continue his noble creature &s;till a rich ble&s;&s;ing to the nation, to be an in&s;trument in forming our execellent con&s;titution.</P>
<P>This being done, and the nation having adopted it; here again God was all and in all, in qualifying our beloved WASHINGTON for that office in &s;tate to which he was unanimou&s;ly called by his fellow citizens. Finally, it was God who made all the difference which there was between our beloved and never to be for|gotten WASHINGTON, and the greate&s;t idiot in the land.</P>
<P>Long did God favor this happy land with all the talents, with all the virtues that &s;hone in his creature WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>But at length the period arrived, when this, like all other temporal ble&s;&s;ings mu&s;t be taken away by the &s;ame hand. The LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away, and it becomes the whole nation to &s;ay, ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the LORD, for it is in righteou&s;ne&s;s he afflicts us, as a nation: we de&s;erve not only this, but much heavier judgement. We ought to realize that
<PB N="8" REF="036905_0007_100B31A96E6EAC48">
the death of this great and eminently u&s;eful man, is a puni&s;hment for our &s;ins, and to be humble before God; yea, and it is &s;uitable that we &s;hould accept the puni&s;h|ment of our iniquities. "Shall we receive good at the hand of the LORD and &s;hall we not receive evil." The evil we de&s;erve, but the good we merit not, it is there|fore mercy. Should we as a nation, &s;uitably conduct under this afflicting &s;troke of God, &s;hould it lead us to true repentance and engage us in the &s;ervice of God, we may with confidence look to and tru&s;t in the great all and in all, to rai&s;e us up another WASHINGTON, &s;hould he be needed to lead forth our warriors to battle, to be an in&s;trument in his hand to do us the good we may need. And in the mid&s;t of our grief for our departed friend, and &s;orrowing under the rod of God, it becomes us to be truly grateful to God for the ble&s;&s;ing we mourn the lo&s;s of. We are not to view WASHINGTON as a God, nor as a Saviour, becau&s;e he was only a man, and as a man he is dead, but our God and our Saviour are alive, and will live forever. Therefore let us view WASHINGTON as a man, and as &s;uch mourn his lo&s;s: and as he was confe&s;&s;edly one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful of men, as &s;uch, he though dead, will live in the memory of his fellow citizens. And his character in this point of view, will ever &s;tand a &s;uitable example for imitation. Would the youth of our land wi&s;h to live re&s;pected, would they arrive to the height of earthly greatne&s;s, and die univer&s;ally lamented, let them look at the example WASHINGTON has &s;et, and go and do like|wi&s;e. But would they wi&s;h to arrive to that felicity and glory, to which the human &s;oul may arrive: let them look to a greater than a WASHINGTON, and imitate the example which he has &s;et, even Je&s;us Chri&s;t, then they may be a&s;&s;ured of not only &s;uch preferment, re&s;pect and veneration as WASHINGTON has on earth, but al&s;o the approbation of their God and Judge, and the enjoyment without end, of &s;uch ble&s;&s;edne&s;s as eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man to conceive of. AMEN.</P>
