Mi&s;s <HI>Ann</HI> was always very good, and took great pains to do every thing that &s;he was de&s;ired; and tried to plea&s;e her Papa and Mamma, and make all her friends happy. She u&s;ed often to think how much care her parents took, to teach her to write, and at|tended to every thing which was proper for her to learn; and if &s;he did not mind them, &s;he knew it was only troubling them for nothing. So if they de&s;ired her to hold up her head, or put back her &s;hould|ers, or turn out her toes, or do any thing el&s;e, &s;he always did it directly, to &s;ave them the trouble of &s;peaking again. You may be &s;ure &s;he was &s;o very good, every body loved her, and did all they could to plea&s;e her; and &s;he was very happy, for &s;he was
<PB N="61" REF="047092_0057_1022A9EFF15E5228">
quite good-humoured, and never cried. And when &s;he grew up &s;he was a very good woman, and becau&s;e her Papa was
