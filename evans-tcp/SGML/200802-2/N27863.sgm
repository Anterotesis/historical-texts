<HEAD>THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY-PLAIN.</HEAD>
<P>MR. JOHNSON, a very worthy chari|table Gentleman, was travelling &s;ome time ago acro&s;s one of tho&s;e va&s;t Plains which are well known in Wilt|&s;hire. It was a fine &s;ummer's evening, and he rode &s;lowly that he might have lei&s;ure to admire God in the works of his creation. For this Gentleman was of opinion, that a walk or a ride, was as proper a time as any to think about good things, for which rea&s;on, on &s;uch occa&s;i|ons he &s;eldom thought &s;o much about his money, or his trade, or public news, as at other times, that he might with more ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction enjoy the pious thoughts which the vi&s;ible works of the great Maker of heaven and earth are in|tended to rai&s;e in the mind.</P>
<P>His attention was all of a &s;udden called off by the barking of a Shepherd's dog,
<PB N="3" REF="037128_0003_100C8334B7DF8720">
and looking up he &s;pied one of tho&s;e little huts, which are here and there to be &s;een on the&s;e great Downs; and near it was the Shepherd him&s;elf bu&s;ily employed with his dog in collecting together his va&s;t flock of &s;heep. As he drew nearer he perceived him to be a clean, well-looking, poor man, near fifty years of age. His coat, though at fir&s;t it had pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+bably been of one dark colour, had been in a long cour&s;e of years &s;o often patched with different &s;orts of cloth, that it was now become hard to &s;ay which had been the original colour. But this, while it gave a plain proof of the Shepherd's po|verty, equally proved the exceeding neat|ne&s;s, indu&s;try, and good management of his wife. His &s;tockings no le&s;s proved her good hou&s;ewifery, for they were entirely covered with darns of different coloured wor&s;ted, but had not a hole in them; and his &s;hirt, though nearly as coar&s;e as the &s;ails of a &s;hip, was as white as the drifted &s;now, and neatly mended where time had either made a re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, or worn it thin. This is a rule of judging, by which one &s;hall &s;eldom be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. If I meet with a labourer, hed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, or mending the highways with his
<PB N="4" REF="037128_0004_100C8337E1B8EB58">
&s;tockings and &s;hirt tight and whole, how|ever mean and bad his other garments are, I have &s;eldom failed, on vi&s;iting his cot|tage, to find that al&s;o clean and well or|dered, and his wife notable, and worthy of encouragement. Whereas a poor wo|man, who will be lying a-bed, or go&s;&s;ip|ping with her neighbours when &s;he ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be fitting out her hu&s;band in a cleanly manner, will &s;eldom be found to be very good in other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>This was not the ca&s;e with our Shep|herd: And Mr. John&s;on was not more &s;truck with the decency of his mean and frugal dre&s;s, than with his open hone&s;t countenance, which bore &s;trong marks of health, cheerfulne&s;s, and &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on, who was on a journey, and &s;omewhat fearful from the appearance of the &s;ky, that rain was at no great di&s;|tance, acco&s;ted the Shepherd with a&s;king what &s;ort of weather he thought it would be on the morrow.&mdash;"It will be &s;uch wea|ther as plea&s;es me," an&s;wered the Shep|herd. Though the an&s;wer was delivered in the milde&s;t and civile&s;t tone that could be imagined, the Gentleman thought the words them&s;elves rather rude and &s;urly, and a&s;ked him how that could be, "Be|cau&s;e,"
<PB N="5" REF="037128_0005_100C833A1B371250">
replied the Shepherd, "it will be &s;uch weather as &s;hall plea&s;e God, and whatever plea&s;es him always plea&s;es me."</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on, who delighted in good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and good things, was very well &s;atis|fied with his reply. For he ju&s;tly thought that though an hypocrite may ea&s;ily con|trive to appear better than he really is to a &s;tranger; and that no one &s;hould be too &s;oon tru&s;ted, merely for having a few good words in his mouth; yet as he knew that "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth &s;peaketh," he always accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to judge favourably of tho&s;e who had a &s;erious deportment and &s;olid man|ner of &s;peaking. "It looks as if it pro|ceeded from a good habit," &s;aid he, "and though I may now and then be deceived by it, yet it has not often happened to me to be &s;o. Whereas, if a man acco&s;ts me with an idle, di&s;&s;olute, vulgar, indecent, or prophane expre&s;&s;ion, I have never been deceived in him, but have generally on inquiry found his character to be as bad as his language gave me room to expect."</P>
<P>He entered into conver&s;ation with the Shepherd in the following manner. Yours is a trouble&s;ome life, hone&s;t friend, &s;aid he. To be &s;ure, Sir, replied the Shepherd,
<PB N="6" REF="037128_0006_100C833C5DBD01B0">
'tis not a very lazy life; but tis not near &s;o toil&s;ome as that which my GREAT MAS|TER led for my &s;ake and he had every &s;tate and condition of life at his choice, and cho&s;e a hard one&mdash;while I only &s;ub|mit to the lot that is appointed me.&mdash;You are expo&s;ed to great cold and heat, &s;aid the Gentleman:&mdash;true, Sir, &s;aid the Shep|herd; but then I am not expo&s;ed to great temptations; and &s;o throwing one thing again&s;t another, God is plea&s;ed to con|trive to make things more equal than we poor, ignorant, &s;hort &s;ighted creatures are apt to think. David was happier when he kept his father's &s;heep on &s;uch a plain as this, and &s;inging &s;ome of his own P&s;alms perhaps, than ever he was when he became king of I&s;rael and Judah. And I dare &s;ay we &s;hould never have had &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful texts in all tho&s;e fine P&s;alms, if he had not been a Shep|herd, which enabled him to make &s;o ma|ny fine compari&s;ons and &s;imilitudes, as one may &s;ay, from a country life, flocks of &s;heep, hills, and vallies, and foun|tains of water.</P>
<P>You think then, &s;aid the Gentleman, that a laborious life is a happy one. I do, Sir, and more &s;o e&s;pecially, as it expo&s;es
<PB N="7" REF="037128_0007_100C833E843AE2C0">
a man to fewer &s;ins. If King Saul had continued a poor laborious man to the end of his days, he might have lived happy and hone&s;t, and died a natural death in his bed at la&s;t, which you know, Sir, was more than he did. But I &s;peak with reverence, for it was divine Provi|dence overruled all that, you know, Sir, and I do not pre&s;ume to make compari|&s;ons. Be&s;ides, Sir, my employment has been particularly honoured&mdash;Mo&s;es was a Shepherd in the plains of Midian.&mdash;I was to "Shepherds keeping their flocks by night," that the angels appeared in Bethlehem, to tell the be&s;t news, the gladde&s;t tidings, that ever were revealed to poor &s;inful men: often, and often has the thought warmed my poor heart in the colde&s;t night, and filled me with more joy and thankfulne&s;s than the be&s;t &s;upper could have done.</P>
<P>Here the Shepherd &s;topped, for he be|gan to feel that he had made too free, and had talked too long. But Mr. John&s;on was &s;o well plea&s;ed with what he &s;aid, and with the cheerful contented manner in which he &s;aid it, that he de&s;ired him to go on freely, for that it was a plea&s;ure to him to meet with a plain man, who
<PB N="8" REF="037128_0008_100C83415D68F9F8">
without any kind of learning but what he had got from the Bible, was able to talk &s;o well on a &s;ubject in which all men, high and low, rich and poor, are equally concerned.</P>
<P>Indeed I am afraid I make too bold, Sir, for it better becomes me to li&s;ten to &s;uch a Gentleman as you &s;eem to be, than to talk in my poor way; but as I was &s;ay|ing, Sir, I wonder all working men do not derive as great joy and delight as I do from thinking how God has honoured poverty! Oh! Sir, what great, or rich, or mighty men have had &s;uch honour put on them, or their condition, as Shep|herds, Tent-makers, Fi&s;hermen, and Car|penters have had?</P>
<P>My hone&s;t friend, &s;aid the Gentleman, I perceive you are well acquainted with &s;cripture. Yes, Sir, pretty well, ble&s;&s;ed be God! through his mercy I learnt to read when I was a little boy; though read|ing was not &s;o common when I was a child, as, I am told, through the good|ne&s;s of Providence, and the genero&s;ity of the rich, it is likely to become now a-days. I believe there is no day for the la&s;t thirty years, that I have not peeped at my Bible&punc;
<PB N="9" REF="037128_0009_100C834377C2FA88">
I defy any man to &s;ay he can't find time to read a ver&s;e; and a &s;ingle text Sir, well followed and put in practice every day, would make no bad figure at the year's end; three hundred and &s;ixty-five texts, without the lo&s;s of a moment's time, would make a pretty &s;tock, a little golden trea&s;ury, as one may &s;ay, from new-year's day to new-year's day; and if children were brought up to it, they would look for their text as naturally as they do for their breakfa&s;t. No labouring man, 'tis true, has &s;o much lei&s;ure as a Shepherd, for while the flock is feeding, I am oblig|ed to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> at &s;uch times I can now and then tap a &s;hoe for my children or my&s;elf, which is a great &s;aving to us, and while I am doing that I repeat a bit of a chapter, which makes the time pa&s;s plea|&s;antly in this wild &s;olitary place. I can &s;ay the be&s;t part of the Bible by heart, I be|lieve I &s;hould not &s;ay the be&s;t part, for every part is good, but I mean the greate&s;t part. I have led but a lonely life, and have often had but little to eat, but my Bible has been meat, drink and company to me, as I may &s;ay, and when want and trouble have come upon me. I dont know what I &s;hould have done indeed, Sir, if I
<PB N="10" REF="037128_0010_100C834500FE68E8">
had not had the promi&s;es of this book for my &s;tay and &s;upport.</P>
<P>You have had great difficulties then? &s;aid Mr. John&s;on. Why, as to that, Sir, not more than neighbours fare, I have but little cau&s;e to complain, and much to be thankful; but I have had &s;ome little &s;truggles, as I will leave you to judge. I have a wife and eight children, whom I bred up in that little cottage which you &s;ee under the hill about half a mile off. What, that with the &s;moke coming out of the chimney, &s;aid the Gentleman. O no, Sir, replied the Shep|herd &s;miling, we have &s;eldom &s;moke in the evening, for we have little to cook, and fireing is very dear in the&s;e parts. 'Tis that cottage which you &s;ee on the left hand of the Church, near that little tuft of haw|thorns. What that hovel with only one room above and one below, with &s;carcely any chimney, how is it po&s;&s;ible you can live there with &s;uch a family! O! it is very po&s;&s;ible and very certain too, cried the Shepherd. How many better men have been wor&s;e lodged! how many good chri&s;tians have peri&s;hed in pri&s;ons and dungeons, in compari&s;on of which my cot|tage is a palace. The hou&s;e is very well,
<PB N="11" REF="037128_0011_100C83472736F4A8">
Sir, and if the rain did not &s;ometimes beat down upon us through the thatch when we are a-bed, I &s;hould not de&s;ire a bet|ter; for I have health, peace, and liber|ty, and no man maketh me afraid.</P>
<P>Well, I will certainly call on you be|fore it be long; but how can you con|trive to lodge &s;o many children? We do the be&s;t we can, Sir. My poor wife is a very &s;ickly woman, or we &s;hould always have done tolerably well. There are no gentry in the pari&s;h, &s;o that &s;he has not met with any great a&s;&s;i&s;tance in her &s;ick|ne&s;s. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he good curate of the pari&s;h who lives in that pretty par&s;onage in the val|ley, is very willing, but not very able to a&s;&s;i&s;t us on the&s;e trying occa&s;ions, for he has little enough for him&s;elf and a large family into the bargain. Yet he does what he can, and more than many richer men do, and more than he can well af|ford. Be&s;ides that, his prayers and good advice we are always &s;ure of, and we are truly thankful for that, for a man mu&s;t give, you know, Sir, according to what he hath, and not according to what he hath not.</P>
<P>Are you in any di&s;tre&s;s at pre&s;ent? &s;aid Mr. John&s;on. No, Sir, thank God, re|plied
<PB N="12" REF="037128_0012_100C90C29C064160">
the Shepherd. I get my &s;hilling a|day, and mo&s;t of my children will &s;oon be able to earn &s;omething; for we have only three under five years of age. Only! &s;aid the Gentleman, that is a heavy burden. Not at all; God fits the back to it. Tho' my wife is not able to do any out of door work, yet &s;he breeds up our children to &s;uch habits of indu&s;try, that our little maids before they are &s;ix years old can fir&s;t get a halfpenny, and then a penny a-day by knitting. The boys who are too little to do hard work, get a trifle by keeping the birds off the corn; for this the farmers will give them a penny or two-pence, and now and then a bit of bread and chee&s;e into the bargain. When the &s;ea&s;on of crow keeping is over, then they glean or pick &s;tones; any thing is better than idlene&s;s, Sir, and if they do not get a farthing by it, I would make them do it ju&s;t the &s;ame, for the &s;ake of giving them early habits of labour.</P>
<P>So you &s;ee, Sir, I am not &s;o badly off as many are; nay, if it were not that it co&s;ts me &s;o much in Potecary's &s;tuff for my poor wife, I &s;hould reckon my&s;elf well off. Nay, I do reckon my&s;elf well off, for ble&s;&s;ed be God, he has granted her life to
<PB N="13" REF="037128_0013_100C90C4ED4C67B0">
my prayers, and I would work my&s;elf to a 'natomy, and live on one meal a-day to add any comfort to her valuable life; in|deed I have often done the la&s;t, and thought it no great matter neither.</P>
<P>While they were on this part of the di&s;|cour&s;e, a fine plump cherry-cheek little girl ran up out of breath, with a &s;mile on her young happy face, and without taking any notice of the Gentleman, cried out with great joy&mdash;Look here, fa|ther, only &s;ee how much I have got to|day! Mr. John&s;on was much &s;truck with her &s;implicity, but puzzled to know what was the occa&s;ion of this great joy. On looking at her he perceived a &s;mall quan|tity of coar&s;e wool, &s;ome of which had found it's way through the holes of her clean, but &s;canty and ragged woollen apron. The father &s;aid, this has been a &s;ucce&s;sful day indeed, Molly, but don't you &s;ee the Gentleman? Molly now made a curt&s;ey down to the very ground; while Mr. John&s;on enquired into the cau&s;e of the mutual &s;atisfaction which both father and daughter had expre&s;&s;ed, at the un|u&s;ual good fortune of the day.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid the Shepherd, poverty is a great &s;harpener of wits.&mdash;My wife and I
<PB N="14" REF="037128_0014_100C90C6DAF04550">
cannot endure to &s;ee our children (poor as they are) without &s;hoes and &s;tockings, not only on account of the pinching cold which cramps their poor little limbs, but becau&s;e it degrades and deba&s;es them; and poor people who have but little re|gard to appearances will &s;eldom be found to have any great regard for hone&s;ty and goodne&s;s; I don't &s;ay this is always the ca&s;e; but I am &s;ure it is &s;o too often. Now &s;hoes and &s;tockings being very dear we could never afford to get them with|out a little contrivance. I mu&s;t &s;hew you how I manage about the &s;hoes when you conde&s;cend to call at our cottage, Sir; as to &s;tockings, this is one way we take to help get them. My young ones who are too little to do much work, &s;ometimes wander at odd hours over the hills for the chance of finding what little wool the &s;heep may drop when they rub them|&s;elves, as they are apt to do, in the bu&s;hes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This piece of fru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al indu&s;try is not imaginary, but a real fact, as is the character of the Shepherd, and his uncommon knowledge of the &s;criptures.</NOTE> The&s;e &s;cattered bits of wool the children pick out of the brambles, which I &s;ee, have torn &s;ad holes in Molly's apron to-day; they carry this
<PB N="15" REF="037128_0015_100C90C8739575A8">
wool home, and when they have got a pretty parcel together, their mother cards it; for &s;he can &s;it and card in the chim|ney corner, when &s;he is not able to wa&s;h, or work about hou&s;e. The bigge&s;t girl then &s;pins it; it does very well for us without dying, for poor people mu&s;t not &s;tand for the colour of their &s;tockings. After this our little boys knit it for them|&s;elves, while they are employed in keep|ing crows in the fields, and after they get home at night. As for the knitting the girls and their mother do, that is chiefly for &s;ale, which helps to pay our rent.</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on lifted up his eyes in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;hifts which hone&s;t poverty can make rather than beg or &s;teal; and was &s;urpri&s;ed to think how many ways of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting there are which tho&s;e who live at their ea&s;e little &s;u&s;pect. He &s;ecret|ly re&s;olved to be more attentive to his own petty expences than he had hitherto been; and to be more watchful that no|thing was wa&s;ted in his family.</P>
<P>But to return to the Shepherd. Mr. John&s;on told him that as he mu&s;t needs be at his friend's hou&s;e, who lived many miles off that night, he could not as he wi&s;hed to do, make a vi&s;it to his cottage
<PB N="16" REF="037128_0016_100C90CAADB29008">
at pre&s;ent. But I will certainly do it, &s;aid he on my return, for I long to &s;ee your wife and her nice little family, and to be an eye witne&s;s of her neatne&s;s and good management. The poor man's tears &s;tarted into his eyes on hearing the com|mendation be&s;towed on his wife; and wiping them off with the &s;leeve of his coat, for he was not worth a handker|chief in the world, he &s;aid&mdash;Oh! Sir, you ju&s;t now, I am afraid, called me an humble man, but indeed I am a very proud one. Proud! exclaimed Mr. John|&s;on, I hope not&mdash;Pride is a great &s;in, and as the poor are liable to it as well as the rich, &s;o good a man as you &s;eem to be, ought to guard again&s;t it. Sir, &s;aid he, you are right, but I am not proud of my&s;elf, God knows, I have nothing to be proud of. I am a poor &s;inner, but indeed Sir, I am proud of my wife: She is not only the mo&s;t tidy, notable wo|man on the Plain, but &s;he is the kinde&s;t wi&s;e and mother, and the mo&s;t con|tented, thankful chri&s;tian that I know. La&s;t year I thought I &s;hould have lo&s;t her in a violent fit of the rheumati&s;m, caught by going to work too &s;oon after her lying-in, I fear; for 'tis but a bleak
<PB N="17" REF="037128_0017_100C90CD64C74C68">
coldi&s;h place, as you may &s;ee, Sir, in winter, and &s;ometimes the &s;now lies &s;o long under the hill, that I can hardly make my&s;elf a path to get out and buy a few nece&s;&s;aries in the next village; and we are afraid to &s;end out the children, for fear they &s;hould be lo&s;t when the &s;now is deep. So, as I was &s;aying, the poor &s;oul was very bad indeed, and for &s;everal weeks lo&s;t the u&s;e of all her limbs except her hands; a merciful Providence &s;pared her the u&s;e of the&s;e, &s;o that when &s;he could not turn in her bed, &s;he could con|trive to patch a rag or two for her family. She was always &s;aying, had it not been for the great goodne&s;s of God, &s;he might have had the pal&s;y in&s;tead of the rheu|mati&s;m, and then &s;he could have done nothing&mdash;but nobody had &s;o many mer|cies as &s;he had.</P>
<P>I will not tell you what we &s;uffered during that bitter weather, Sir, but my wife's faith and patience during that try|ing time, were as good a le&s;&s;on to me as any Sermon I could hear, and yet Mr. Jenkins gave us very comfortable ones too, that helped to keep up my &s;pirits.</P>
<P>One Sunday afternoon when my wife
<PB N="18" REF="037128_0018_100C90CEF5B54C50">
was at the wor&s;t, as I was coming out of Church, for I went one part of the day, and my elde&s;t daughter the other, &s;o my poor wife was never left alone. As I was coming out of Church, I &s;ay, Mr. Jenkins the mini&s;ter called out to me, and a&s;ked me how my wife did, &s;aying he had been kept from coming to &s;ee her by the deep fall of &s;now, and indeed from the par&s;on|age-hou&s;e to my hovel it was quite im|pa&s;&s;ible. I gave him all the particulars he a&s;ked, and I am afraid a good many more, for my heart was quite full. He kindly gave me a &s;hilling, and &s;aid he would certainly try to pick out his way and come and &s;ee her in a day or two.</P>
<P>While he was talking to me, a plain farmer-looking Gentleman in boots, who &s;tood by, li&s;tened to all I &s;aid, but &s;eem|ed to take no notice. It was Mr. Jenkins's wife's father, who was come to pa&s;s the Chri&s;tmas holidays at the par&s;onage-hou&s;e. I had always heard him &s;poken of as a plain frugal man, who lived clo&s;e him&s;elf, but was remarked to give away more than any of his &s;how-away neigh|bours.</P>
<P>Well! I went home with great &s;pirits at this &s;ea&s;onable and unexpected &s;upply

for we had tapped our la&s;t &s;ix-pence, and there was little work to be had on ac|count of the weather. I told my wife I was not come back empty handed. No, I dare &s;ay not, &s;ays &s;he, you have been &s;erving a ma&s;ter "who filleth the hungry with good things, though he &s;endeth the rich empty away." True, Mary, &s;ays I: we &s;eldom fail to get good &s;piritual food from Mr. Jenkins, but to day he has kind|ly &s;upplied our bodily wants. She was more thankful when I &s;hewed her the &s;hil|ling, than I dare &s;ay, &s;ome of your great people are when they get an hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on's heart &s;mote him when he heard &s;uch a value &s;et upon a &s;hilling; &s;urely, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, I will never wa&s;te another; but he &s;aid nothing to the Shepherd, who thus pur&s;ued his &s;tory.</P>
<P>Next morning before I went out, I &s;ent part of the money to buy a little ale and brown &s;ugar to put into her water gruel; which you know, Sir, made it nice and nouri&s;hing. I went out to cleave wood in a farm yard, for there was no &s;tanding out on the plain, after &s;uch a &s;now as had fallen in the night. I went with a lighter heart than u&s;ual, becau&s;e I had left my

poor wife a little better; and comfortably &s;upplied for this day, and I now re&s;olved more than ever to tru&s;t in God for the &s;upplies of the next. When I came back at night, my wife fell a crying as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me. This, I own I thought but a bad return for the ble&s;&s;ings &s;he had &s;o lately received, and &s;o I told her. O, &s;aid &s;he, it is too much, we are too rich; I am now frightened, not le&s;t we &s;hould have no portion in this world, but for fear we &s;hould have our whole portion in it. Look here, John! So &s;aying &s;he uncovered the bed whereon &s;he lay, and &s;hewed me two warm, thick, new blank|ets. I could not believe my own eyes, Sir, becau&s;e when I went out in the morning, I had left her with no other covering than our little old thin blue rug. I was &s;till more amazed when &s;he put half a crown into my hand, telling me &s;he had had a vi&s;it from Mr. Jenkins, and Mr. Jones, the latter of whom had be&s;towed all the&s;e good things upon us. Thus, Sir, have our lives been crowned with mercies. My wife got about again, and I do believe, under Providence, it was owing to the&s;e comforts; for the rheumati&s;m, Sir, without blankets by

night and flannel by day, is but a bad|di&s;h job, e&s;pecially to people who have little or no fire. She will always be a weakly body; but thank God her &s;oul pro&s;pers and is in health. But I beg your pardon, Sir, for talking on at this rate. Not at all, not at all, &s;aid Mr. John&s;on; you &s;hall certainly &s;ee me in a few days, Good night. So &s;aying, he &s;lipped a crown into his hand, and rode off. Sure|ly, &s;aid the Shepherd, <HI>goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life,</HI> as he gave the money to his wife when he got home at night.</P>
<P>As to Mr. John&s;on, he found abundant matter for his thoughts during the re&s;t of his journey. On the whole he was more di&s;po&s;ed to envy than to pity the Shep|herd. I have &s;eldom &s;een, &s;aid he, &s;o happy a man. It is a &s;ort of happine&s;s which the world could not give, and which I plainly &s;ee, it has not been able to take away. This mu&s;t be the true &s;pirit of Religion. I &s;ee more and more, that true goodne&s;s is not merely a thing of words and opinions, but a Living Principle brought into every common ac|tion of a man's life. What el&s;e could have &s;upported this poor couple under

every bitter trial of want, and &s;ickne&s;s? No, my hone&s;t Shepherd, I do not pity, but I re&s;pect and even honour thee; and I will vi&s;it thy poor hovel on my return to Sali&s;bury with as much plea&s;ure as I am now going to the hou&s;e of my friend.</P>
<P>If Mr. John&s;on keeps his word in &s;end|ing me the account of his vi&s;it to the Shepherd's cottage, I &s;hall be very glad to entertain my readers with it, and &s;hall conclude this fir&s;t part.</P>

<HEAD>The Lanca&s;hire Collier Cirl. A TRUE STORY.</HEAD>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>IN a &s;mall village in Lanca&s;hire there li|ved a few years ago, an indu&s;trious man and his wife, who had &s;ix children. The man him&s;elf u&s;ed to work in a neighbour|ing colliery, while the wi&s;e took care of the family, attended al&s;o to their little farm, and minded the dairy, and when all her other work was done, &s;he u&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to &s;it down to &s;pin.

not &s;uffered to be idle. The elde&s;t daugh|ter worked with the mother at the &s;pinning-wheel, which &s;he learnt to think a very plea&s;ant employment, and &s;he &s;ometimes accompanied her work with a cheerful hymn, or a good moral &s;ong, which her parents had taken care to teach her.</P>
<P>But the &s;econd daughter of the name of <HI>Mary</HI> is the chief &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent &s;tory: when this girl was nine years old, the hone&s;t collier finding that he had but little employment for her above ground, took her to work with him down in the coal-pit together with one of his boys, who was then no more than &s;even years of age. The&s;e two children readily put their &s;trength to the ba&s;ket; dragging the coals from the workmen to the mouth of the pit; and by their joint labours they did the duty of one of tho&s;e men, who are commonly called "the drawers," clearing thereby no le&s;s than &s;even &s;hil|lings a week for their parents. It mu&s;t be owned to be not impo&s;&s;ible, that they may have &s;ometimes exerted them&s;elves even beyond their &s;trength; which is now and then the ca&s;e with little children, through the fault of tho&s;e who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> act the work from them; but &s;ince in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his ca&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="037128_0025_100C90DE1A182D00">
the father had an eye to them during the hours of labour, while they had a prudent and tender mother al&s;o, to look after them at home, there is no particular rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that at the time of which we are now &s;peaking, they were ever much o|ver-worked.</P>
<P>Here then let us &s;top to remark how different was the ca&s;e of this numerous family from that of many others, in the &s;ame humble &s;ituation of life. <HI>Mary</HI> and her brother, &s;o far from being a burthen, were bringing a little fortune to their pa|rents, even when they were eight or ten years old; all the family were getting forward by the help of the&s;e little crea|tures, and their worldly comforts were now increa&s;ing on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>But alas! in the mid&s;t of this cheerful and contented diligence, on one fatal day, while the good man was in the act of fix|ing a ba&s;ket, in order to its being wound up, the children &s;tanding near him in the coal-pit, &s;ome &s;tones fell from the top of the pit, one of which fell on the father's head, and killed him on the &s;pot. What a melancholy event was this! &s;ome di&s;mal circum&s;tances al&s;o remain to be told, which were the con&s;equences of it; but in order
<PB N="26" REF="037128_0026_100C90DFCD915F98">
to relieve the pain of my reader, I will here remark, that the mo&s;t grievous afflictions are often appointed by providence, to be the means, in one way or other, of calling &s;ome extraordinary virtue into exerci&s;e; and accordingly we &s;hall &s;ee that the calamity which is now &s;poken of, will introduce <HI>Mary,</HI> the young collier girl, to the farther good opinion of the reader.</P>
<P>The mother, on hearing the news of her hu&s;band's death, together with the de&s;crip|tion of the &s;ad accident which gave occa|&s;ion to it, received &s;uch a &s;hock, that her mind was not able to bear up under it; &s;he became di&s;ordered in her under&s;tanding, nor did &s;he to the end of her life recover her &s;en&s;es. Being now rendered extreme|ly helple&s;s, &s;he was &s;eparated from her children by the pari&s;h officers, who con|tinued to take the charge of her for the &s;pace of five years. A &s;hort time after the father's death, the elde&s;t daughter, (the &s;pinner) married, and went from home; two of the brothers, (of the ages of nine and &s;even,) were bound apprentices by the pari&s;h, which al&s;o took the charge of two others, (one three years old, the other an infant) until they &s;hould be &s;ufficiently grown up to be bound out al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="037128_0027_100C90E170D06A08">In this place I cannot avoid ob&s;erving, what a ble&s;&s;ing it is to poor people in this country, that pari&s;h officers are obliged, in all &s;uch ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity as that of which I am now &s;peaking, to give maintainance to tho&s;e, who apply to them, and what a pity it is that this wi&s;e and merciful provi&s;ion of our laws &s;hould ever be abu&s;ed. <HI>Mary,</HI> the girl of whom we are giving the hi&s;tory, ha|ing been already trained to indu&s;try, was by no means di&s;po&s;ed to &s;eek any unnece&s;|&s;ary help from the pari&s;h, and being now between eleven and twelve years old, &s;he determined to maintain her&s;elf, like a lit|tle independent woman, by her u&s;ual work in the coal pit, where &s;he was generally a|ble after this time to earn at lea&s;t a &s;hil|ling a day; in three or four years after|wards earning no le&s;s than two &s;hillings. And now I would a&s;k my young female readers, what they think was the manner in which &s;he employed all this fruit of her indu&s;try? Do you imagine that &s;he laid it out in vanity of dre&s;s, in nice eating and drinking, or other needle&s;s expence? or do you &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he would now indulge her&s;elf in idlene&s;s on one or two days in the week, becau&s;e &s;he had got enough for
<PB N="28" REF="037128_0028_100C90E54D9BF688">
her&s;elf to live upon during the four or five working days? no: I tru&s;t you will have formed no &s;uch expectation: I hope you will be well aware what <HI>Mary</HI> did with her money, by having already reflected what you would have done with it in the like ca&s;e. She in the fir&s;t place relea&s;ed the pari&s;h from the burthen of maintaining her mother, which &s;he did as &s;oon as &s;he was arrived at the age of &s;ixteen, being ex|tremely anxious to take this poor di&s;order|ed helple&s;s parent home to live with her|&s;elf: &s;he then relieved the pari&s;h officers from the charge of one of her brothers, and &s;he continued to provide for him, until he died. Having been taught never to con|&s;ider her duty as done, while any part of it &s;eemed to be left undone, &s;he afterwards undertook the maintainance of one of her other brothers, who remained with her du|ring &s;ixteen weeks illne&s;s, at the end of which period &s;he followed him to the grave, burying him at her own expence. After a|bout &s;even years the mother died al&s;o, and was buried in like manner by this dutiful child, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the pa|ri&s;h.</P>
<P>If any of my readers &s;hould here in|quire how it could be po&s;&s;ible for &s;o young
<PB N="29" REF="037128_0029_100C90E801F2E6C0">
a child to &s;upport all the&s;e relations, many of them being al&s;o occa&s;ionally very bur|then&s;ome through their &s;ickne&s;s? the an|&s;wer is, that in the ca&s;e of the&s;e extraor|dinary calls upon her, &s;he u&s;ed to betake her&s;elf to extraordinary labour, &s;ometimes earning no le&s;s than three &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence in the four and twenty hours, by taking what is called "a double turn" in the coal-pits.</P>
<P>The ready &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Mary</HI> to her parents when &s;he was in early life, is &s;o plea&s;ing a part of her character, that it may be proper in this place again, to make a remark upon it. Let my young readers recollect that in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the command of her father, or rather to that law of God which enjoins parental obedi|ence, &s;he cheerfully followed him down into the coal-pit, burying her&s;elf in the bowels of the earth, and there at a tender age, without excu&s;ing her&s;elf on account of her &s;ex, &s;he joined in the &s;ame work with the miners, a race of men rough in|deed, but highly u&s;eful to the community, of whom I am al&s;o happy to &s;ay that they have the character of being hone&s;t and faithful, as well as remarkably courageous, and that they have given moreover &s;ome
<PB N="30" REF="037128_0030_100C90EA2E88E338">
&s;triking in&s;tances of their readine&s;s to re|ceive religious in&s;truction, when offered to them. Among the&s;e men to their ho|nor be it &s;poken, <HI>Mary's</HI> virtue was &s;afe, and after the death of her father, &s;he is even &s;aid to have received protection, as well as a&s;&s;i&s;tance from them; her fatigue having been &s;ometimes le&s;&s;ened, through their lending her a helping hand, with great feeling and kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>But though <HI>Mary's</HI> mind was naturally &s;trong, and her con&s;titution of body was very &s;tout al&s;o, yet towards the end of the period which has been &s;poken of, &s;he be|gan to be bowed down in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by the afflictions and labors which &s;he had endured. It was evident that &s;he had now been led to exert her&s;elf beyond her &s;trength. How lamentable is it, that while &s;o many people in the world are idle, and are contracting di&s;ea&s;es both of body and mind, from the abundance of their riches, and from want of &s;ome whole&s;ome and u&s;eful exerci&s;e, there &s;hould be any bend|ing like <HI>Mary,</HI> under their work, hidden in coal-pits, or from &s;ome cau&s;e or other removed from ob&s;ervation! what a pity is it I &s;ay, that the former &s;hould not employ a little of their time and money in en|deavouring
<PB N="31" REF="037128_0031_100C90EC70886870">
to find the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed objects! And I may al&s;o add, how lamentable a thing is it, that while &s;o many poor peo|ple are &s;een, who are apt to complain too &s;oon, there &s;hould be any, who do not tell their di&s;tre&s;&s;es to tho&s;e who can help them (which I tru&s;t however does not of|ten happen) till it is almo&s;t too late!</P>
<P>I was ob&s;erving that <HI>Mary</HI> began about this time evidently to lo&s;e her &s;trength, and her head was al&s;o troubled by &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;trange and unplea&s;ant imaginations, which are known by per&s;ons conver&s;ant with the di&s;ea&s;es of the poor, to be no un|u&s;ual con&s;equence of bad food, and great bodily fatigue, joined with exce&s;&s;ive grief. At fir&s;t &s;he was not aware that &s;he labour|ed under any di&s;order, for &s;he had &s;eldom experienced ill health, while her relations were alive; and it &s;eems probable that the comfort which &s;he derived from the re|flection of affording them &s;upport, and the plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations which aro&s;e during the exerci&s;e of her attention to them had &s;erved both to keep up her &s;pirits, and to prevent her con&s;titution from breaking down.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t it is not &s;uper&s;titious to &s;uppo&s;e that when &s;incere chri&s;tians come, as Ma|ry

now did, into very trying circum&s;tan|ces, they may hope, notwith&s;tanding any appearances to the contrary, to experi|ence &s;till in one way or other, the peculi|ar ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven; I do not expect that &s;uch per&s;ons will be free from pain, pover|ty, or &s;ickne&s;s, or other worldly evils, for it is often quite the contrary, but then I be|lieve that the&s;e very afflictions will be made the means of encrea&s;ing their tru&s;t in God, and prove in the end, (I mean ei|ther here or hereafter) to have been en|tirely de&s;igned for their good. The cala|mities of <HI>Mary</HI> were now ri&s;en to &s;uch a height, that tho&s;e who are not accu&s;tomed to view things in this religious and mo&s;t comforting light, might be ready to ima|gine that the Almighty had for&s;aken her, and that there is little u&s;e in &s;erving him. Let us here number up her afflictions. She had &s;een with her own eyes the dread|ful death of her father, &s;he had for a long time witne&s;&s;ed the affecting condition of her mother, who u&s;ed to follow her about the hou&s;e, without knowing the hand by which &s;he was &s;upported; <HI>Mary,</HI> be&s;ides this, had attended the long and drooping &s;ickne&s;s of her two brothers; and now ha|ving fallen &s;ick her&s;elf, being both weak in
<PB N="33" REF="037128_0033_100C90F143546EA8">
body, and &s;adly enfeebled in her mind, &s;he was dwelling all alone in a little com|fortle&s;s habitation, having been deprived by death of every one of tho&s;e dear rela|tives, the &s;ight of whom had many a time cheered her &s;pirits, while the idea of &s;up|plying them with a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ance, had been u&s;ed to &s;weeten her em|ployment, and lighten the &s;everity of her toil.</P>
<P>It was at this period of her extremity that it plea&s;ed God to rai&s;e up for her &s;ome kind friends, in the manner which I &s;hall now de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>A lady of the &s;ame village heard that a &s;ervant's place was vacant in a neighbour|ing family, and advi&s;ed <HI>Mary,</HI> feeble as &s;he was, to pre&s;ent her&s;elf there, as a can|didate to fill this comparatively ea&s;y and comfortable &s;ituation. Accordingly the poor girl, with an anxious heart, went to offer her &s;ervices; &s;he mentioned with her u&s;ual hone&s;ty, what had been the habits of her former life, and what was the &s;tate of her health al&s;o&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;eemed undoubtedly much again&s;t her intere&s;t to do &s;o, but it was perfectly right; and how can any of us hope for the ble&s;&s;ing of God, or expect any true comfort in our minds when we
<PB N="34" REF="037128_0034_100C90F2D252C3F0">
fall into affliction, if we fly to unfair means of re&s;cuing our&s;elves out of it; and in&s;tead of tru&s;ting in God, tru&s;t to our own little frauds, and crooked contrivan|ces.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer made to <HI>Mary's</HI> application was unfavourable, for it was thought, and indeed it was gently hinted, that a young woman, hitherto &s;o much expo&s;ed as &s;he had been, was not likely to prove a very fit inmate in a &s;ober private family.</P>
<P><HI>Mary</HI> felt very keenly this unhappy &s;u&s;|picion again&s;t her character; but what could &s;he do? &s;he walked very quietly away, with a down-ca&s;t look, and with a mind quite broken down by this fre&s;h af|fliction and di&s;a&s;ter. The owners of the man&s;ion happened however to ob&s;erve her countenance, and the peculiar mode&s;ty of her manner, as &s;he was taking her de|parture, for her patient and &s;ilent grief touched them far more &s;en&s;ibly than any loud complaints could have done and they therefore determined to make &s;ome in|quiries concerning her. The gentleman went him&s;elf on the &s;ame day to the colli|ery, where the ma&s;ter of the pit replied to his que&s;tions, nearly in the following terms. "Sir, &s;aid he, &s;he is a poor girl
<PB N="35" REF="037128_0035_100C90F4636E6388">
that has over-worked her&s;elf, for &s;he has undertaken what we call ta&s;k work, which is very hard labour; &s;he is one of the be&s;t girls that ever I knew, and is re&s;pect|ed by all the colliers, and though (added he) I cannot deny that now and then my men take a cup too much, which is apt to make the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ometimes quarrel&s;ome, yet they never &s;uffer a bad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to be &s;poken or an affront to be offered to a girl in the pit, without puni&s;hing the fellow who may be guilty, and making him heartily a&s;hamed of him&s;elf."</P>
<P>This rule of decency and propriety towards young women, e&s;tabli&s;hed by a &s;et of coar&s;e miners, is here recorded for the benefit of &s;ome of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who are plea&s;ed to call them&s;elves their betters.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, after a very minute and full exami|nation, was &s;o well &s;atisfied of the good character of <HI>Mary,</HI> that &s;he was received into his &s;ervice, in which &s;he has now been living comfortably for about the &s;pace of &s;ix years. Her health is recovered, her habits of diligence are &s;till very great, and &s;he is &s;aid to be of a remarkably mode&s;t, humble and contented &s;pirit. It may not be improper to mention, that the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e in which &s;he is, has furni&s;hed all the materials of this &s;tory.</P>
<P>I will now take leave of my readers, by remarking, that the little tale which I have been reciting, &s;eems to me to hold out the following u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I think it may teach the poor, that they can &s;eldom be in any condition of life &s;o low, as to prevent their ri&s;ing to &s;ome degree of independence, if they chu&s;e to exert them&s;elves, and that there can be no &s;ituation whatever &s;o mean, as to forbid the prac|tice of many noble virtues. It may in&s;truct the rich not to turn the poor from their doors, merely on account of fir&s;t appearances, but rather to examine into their character, expecting &s;ometimes to find peculiar mode&s;ty and merit, even in the mo&s;t expo&s;ed &s;ituations. This
