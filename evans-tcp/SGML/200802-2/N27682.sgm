<P>IT is better to go to the hou&s;e of mourn|ing than to the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting, is the ob&s;ervation of one, who was well acquainted with human na|ture, and capable of giving excellent directions for the conduct of human life. That this is &s;uch an hou&s;e, appears from the &s;adne&s;s of every counte|nance, proceeding from real &s;orrow of heart and the &s;ymbols of mourning con&s;picuous to every eye. To &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome &s;ea&s;onable thoughts, on this mournful occa&s;ion, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;peaker; and that he may be better able to arrange his ideas and fix the attention of his hearers, he will at|tempt a compari&s;on between the greate&s;t man in the Ea&s;t and the greate&s;t man in the We&s;t, who&s;e death is this day univer&s;ally lamented, and to per|petuate the remembrance of his virtues thou&s;ands, nay millions, are a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;age I &s;hall &s;elect from the &s;acred vol|ume for my text, you may find in
<Q><BIBL><HI>DEUTERONONY 34 Chap. part of the 5.7.8. ver&s;es.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Mo&s;es the &s;ervant of the Lord died. Mo&s;es was an hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. And the children of I&s;rael wept for Mo&s;es.</P></Q></P>
<P>SO died Mo&s;es at an advanced period, without feeling tho&s;e decays, which have been the portion of the human kind in every age: So died WASH|INGTON in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mental pow|ers,
<PB N="4" REF="036897_0004_100B2ECEE766CEA8">
and without any material decay in his &s;en&s;es or his limbs, at an age, when &s;uch an exemption could hardly be expected. I do not know that there was any thing miraculous in either. They both, early in life, adopted &s;uch principles and pur&s;ued &s;uch a cour&s;e as had a direct tendency to protract life, as far as within the reach of human ability, and to prevent the natural decays of age.</P>
<P>THEY were both favoured with good natural con&s;titutions; they were both temperate in all things; they were both abundant in labours; they were both men of piety and un&s;potted virtue; and of con&s;equence enjoyed ea&s;y and quiet minds, without anxiety and without vexation; they both went to the grave in peace.</P>
<P>BUT they did not re&s;emble each other more in their deaths, than they did in their lives. They were both born for public life, they filled impor|tant &s;tations with dignity to them&s;elves and ad|vantage to mankind. We &s;hall de&s;cend to a few particulars in which the re&s;emblance appears.</P>
<P>MOSES was a man of great mode&s;ty and exceed|ingly diffident of his own abilities to fill the &s;tation to which he was called. He declined the arduous ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned him, as far as prudence and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to unerring Wi&s;dom would permit. Had he gone any farther, his mode&s;ty would have been converted into ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was equally diffident and di&s;tru&s;t|ful of his qualifications for the important work to which he was called. It was impo&s;&s;ible for him to be without his fears, that the &s;pirit of lib|erty, which pervaded all orders of men, would
<PB N="5" REF="036897_0005_100B2ED06C782F90">
decline, if not die, and that the people would grow weary of &s;uffering and wi&s;h to return to their former &s;tate. Succe&s;s was what he could not command, how well &s;oever he might de&s;erve it. If he had failed at an early period, the mo&s;t ignominious death mu&s;t have been his portion. If he had had an hundred lives, ju&s;tice, his ene|mies would have &s;aid, demanded them all. Noth|ing &s;hort of the unanimous voice of the Congre&s;s, of the army, and the people, could have drawn him from his beloved retirement. He made up his mind on the mo&s;t mature con&s;ideration, and came forth, determined to deliver his brethren from their oppre&s;&s;ions and their fears, or peri&s;h in the attempt. The joy expre&s;&s;ed at his acceptance of the command of our armies, was nearly equal to the grief that has been manife&s;ted at his death.</P>
<P>IF he had been appointed like Mo&s;es immediately by Heaven, we could not have put much greater confidence in him. Unanimity was the con&s;e|quence; unanimity &s;aved us. It is true, the <HI>Farm|er's</HI> maxim, uttered at an early period, was in eve|ry mouth: <HI>"United we &s;tand, divided we fall."</HI> But this maxim would have had but little effect, if we had not had a leader to give it force.</P>
<P>MOSES was a man of great prudence.</P>
<P>HE was cool in his temper, deliberate in his be|haviour, a ra&s;h word &s;eldom, if ever, proceeded from his lips; nor did the want of fore&s;ight and di&s;|cretion plunge him into difficulties and embarra&s;&s;|ments to &s;uch a degree, as to wound his reputation and prevent &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="036897_0006_100B2ED29100B110">WASHINGTON had the mo&s;t important qualifi|cation of an able general, a wi&s;e di&s;cernment be|twixt things difficult and impracticable. To &s;hrink from the former is weakne&s;s, to attempt the latter madne&s;s. Such was his wi&s;dom of pre|vention, he had but little occa&s;ion for that of rem|edy. His uncommon &s;obriety, unremitted atten|tion, and continual activity, pre&s;erved him from hurtful errors and mi&s;takes. He lived not a mo|ment without thought, nor was any thing put off till to-morrow that could be done to-day. Though he heard every thing, yet this did not prevent his &s;eeing every thing, &s;o far as circum&s;tances would permit. He always con&s;idered the eye of the gen|eral more influential than his words. Where danger was mo&s;t imminent, and his pre&s;ence mo&s;t needed, there his exertions were mo&s;t con&s;picuous. As he never avoided the po&s;t of danger, he led others to con&s;ider it a po&s;t of honour. Great prudence was nece&s;&s;ary to form a union in the American army, compo&s;ed, as it was, of raw, un|di&s;ciplined troops, drawn from different quarters, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of different principles, habits and preju|dices, and all in a great degree void of that &s;pirit of &s;ubordination ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in an army. The&s;e difficulties were all &s;urmounted, and nearly as much harmony was found in the American as in the Briti&s;h camp, without that lo&s;s of &s;pirit, that is often, if not always, found in tho&s;e who have been drilled to the &s;ervice by the &s;evere&s;t di&s;|cipline. The Americans, taken from the fields of freedom, could not bear that &s;everity of di&s;ci|pline frequently found in veteran armies. Our
<PB N="7" REF="036897_0007_100B2ED41539F1D8">
prudent leader conformed to their humours and their habits, &s;o far as public &s;afety would permit, and by &s;o doing he was obeyed more from affec|tion than fear.</P>
<P>MOSES was a man of fortitude. His courage never for&s;ook him, though his &s;ituation was often di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and his pro&s;pect gloomy. He was early convinced there was no &s;afety but in per&s;everance. To look back was death or wor&s;e.</P>
<P>THE courage of the American chief was never doubted by friend or foe. If it had been, it would totally have di&s;qualified him for his place. The want of per&s;onal bravery is a weakne&s;s in a gene|ral not to be forgiven. WASHINGTON on all oc|ca&s;ions had the perfect command of him&s;elf. He never fled when duty called him to pur&s;ue, nor did he quit the ground as long as any hope of vic|tory remained. During the fir&s;t &s;tages of the con|te&s;t, his courage and &s;kill were more con&s;picuous in his retreats than in his victories. The&s;e were conducted in &s;uch manner, that the enemy profit|ed but little by the victories they won and the advantages they gained. A defen&s;ive mode of war he adopted, as being the only mode the Americans were able to pur&s;ue, and which he was well a&s;&s;ur|ed would lead to conque&s;t in the end. It is time and &s;ervice that makes &s;oldiers; it is danger that creates courage; it is hard&s;hip that makes men hardy. The American army mu&s;t grow better with time, the Briti&s;h decay. The Americans will conquer if they are not conquered, was his maxim.</P>
<P>THE patrioti&s;m of the Jewi&s;h lawgiver equalled his fortitude. His patrioti&s;m was of the virtuous
<PB N="8" REF="036897_0008_100ADD0F1A1108E0">
kind. It was the fir&s;t wi&s;h of the Jewi&s;h leader to deliver his brethren from oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;lavery. Avarice and ambition were not in his heart, nor was the de&s;ire of making conque&s;ts, like &s;ome an|cient and modern republics, the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of his mind. Could he &s;ee his friends and compan|ions in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of freedom, he was content. As to him&s;elf, while he dwelt in Pharaoh's court he had nothing to endure, nor any thing to fear. He was too important to be in&s;ulted or neglected; and we know of no rea&s;on that he had to dread a change of circum&s;tances: "But Mo&s;es cho&s;e rath|er to &s;uffer affliction with the people of God, than enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;in for a &s;ea&s;on." We commend his choice, and do mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h that &s;uch patriots may increa&s;e in the old world and in the new.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was not inferior to Mo&s;es in this amiable virtue. If ever there was a man in the world, who di&s;covered a truly patriotic &s;pirit, who &s;pent life for the good of his country and coun|trymen, who expo&s;ed his health, hazarded his life, and every thing dear to him of a temporal nature, WASHINGTON was the man. Hi&s;tory furni&s;hes no in&s;tance of a man, who went beyond him in a truly public and patriotic &s;pirit. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an ample fortune, he might have lived much at his ea&s;e. Books, a few &s;elect friends, and rural em|ployments, in which his &s;oul delighted, would have made him as happy as the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things would permit; but he cho&s;e rather to ri&s;k his fortune with that of his brethren, than enjoy the plea&s;ures his circum&s;tances afforded him.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="036897_0009_100B2ED969DA7E28">MOSES was a man of great humanity. This ap|pears from the general tenor of his conduct. If in &s;ome in&s;tances there is the appearance of &s;everity, it is owing to nece&s;&s;ity or peculiar circum&s;tances, and not to a cruel di&s;po&s;ition. Time will not per|mit me to de&s;cend to particulars.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was equally humane. He might have obtained more glory in the opinion of &s;ome, if he had been more lavi&s;h of human blood. He nev|er expo&s;ed his men to danger any farther than ne|ce&s;&s;ity required, or there was an hopeful pro&s;pect of obtaining &s;ome permanent advantage. Le&s;s blood, perhaps, was never &s;hed in a war &s;o complicated, &s;o lengthy, and for the mo&s;t part carried on again&s;t &s;uperior numbers. It was his humanity that ena|bled him to &s;ecure the affections of the army, be|yond what is common. This affection, principally, held the army together during certain periods of &s;uffering all the pains of hunger, cold, nakedne&s;s, and incapacity of making any great re&s;i&s;tance, if the enemy had known their weakne&s;s, and been di&s;po&s;ed to attack them with their whole force. His pathetic entreaties more than once detain|ed the men in camp after their enli&s;tments were expired. They could not for&s;ake their general, who was willing to &s;pend and be &s;pent for the good of the army and the happine&s;s of his country.</P>
<P>MOSES was as much di&s;tingui&s;hed for his meek|ne&s;s, as for any other quality of his mind. Our children are not badly in&s;tructed, when in their infancy or early childhood, they are taught that MOSES excelled all in this amiable di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="036897_0010_100B2EDC26B40908">WASHINGTON in this re&s;pect was not inferior to Mo&s;es. Pa&s;&s;ions he had, and they, who have been be&s;t acquainted with him, &s;ay they were &s;trong. This we can ea&s;ily believe, for &s;uch are always found in &s;trong minds. It was the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on of his life, to reduce them to rea&s;on. He effected it; and this paved the way to promotion, and pre|pared him to take the command of his brethren. When his &s;pirit was &s;tirred within him and his heart waxed hot, the &s;inger of &s;ilence re&s;ted on his lips. He early learnt what the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate are willing to acknowledge, that nothing is well done in anger, that ra&s;hne&s;s in action lays a foun|dation for repentance at lei&s;ure. If he was not &s;o deci&s;ive as &s;ome; by accu&s;toming him&s;elf always to think, he made fewer mi&s;takes than others. His fore&s;ight and attention prevented the nece&s;&s;ity of doing things twice in order to be wi&s;e.</P>
<P>MOSES was as much di&s;tingui&s;hed in the cab|inet, as in the field. He was the greate&s;t law|giver, the world had ever &s;een. He formed a re|public under which the people for a long time en|joyed an uncommon &s;hare of liberty and &s;afety, and which might have continued much longer than it did, if the wantonne&s;s of &s;ome and the wickedne&s;s of others had not led them to wi&s;h for a change.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was as much re&s;pected at the head of our councils, as he had been at the head of our armies. As he had been fir&s;t in war, &s;o he was fir&s;t in peace. The people, though divided in every thing el&s;e, united in choo&s;ing him their pre&s;|ident, and in &s;uch manner as was &s;eldom if ever
<PB N="11" REF="036897_0011_100B2EDDAB792A68">
known before, and the like is hardly to be expect|ed again. Among many men &s;cattered over an immen&s;e tract of country, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing different views, intere&s;ts, and habits, there was but one mind. The voice of millions was con&s;idered by our great friend and patron as the voice of God, and he con&s;ented to take the helm when the &s;hip was &s;uppo&s;ed to be in great danger. His prudence, patience, and fortitude le&s;&s;ened, if it did not ex|terminate, the &s;pirit of party; and all orders uni|ted for the benefit of the republic. Many had &s;uppo&s;ed, during the conte&s;t, that when the rod that had been held over us, was removed, our lot would be that of the Grecian &s;tates, who waged perpetual war with each other. The Federal Con|&s;titution laid a foundation for perpetual union. WASHINGTON was at the head, when it was fram|ed; and the commencement of its admini&s;tration was committed to his hands, and he continued in office longer than he intended, becau&s;e he was de|termined not to quit the helm in a &s;torm. The line he adopted, when it was extremely difficult to determine what cour&s;e it was be&s;t to pur&s;ue, has (under Providence) &s;aved this nation from the calamities of a dreadful war, and enabled us to enjoy a great &s;hare of peace, and as large a portion of temporal pro&s;perity as the world has ever &s;een.</P>
<P>WHEN war broke out in Europe, our polit|ical Father thought it be&s;t that America &s;hould ob&s;erve the line of neutrality. By taking an ac|tive part, we had every thing to lo&s;e and nothing to gain. The voice of the people, if I mi&s;take not, was for war; they have &s;ince been convinced
<PB N="12" REF="036897_0012_100B2EDFEC005BC8">
of their mi&s;take. If we had engaged, we &s;hould probably have lo&s;t all that we had gained, and both our circum&s;tances and pro&s;pects would have been infinitely wor&s;e, than they were before the revolu|tion began. The war has not yet ended, and we cannot &s;ay how or when it will. The principles that were fir&s;t adopted by the French revolution|i&s;ts appear to be nearly abandoned by tho&s;e now in power, and all hope of e&s;tabli&s;hing a free repub|lic is at an end. Let them adopt what form they may, military de&s;poti&s;m mu&s;t continue for &s;ome length of time. By ob&s;erving the line of neutral|ity, we have &s;uffered; but nothing, it is probable, to what we &s;hould have done, if we had been weak enough to have engaged in war. The enmi|ty between the two great rival powers has been the &s;ource of nearly all our &s;ufferings; but they have not been &s;o great, as they would have been, if we had joined with one &s;ide or the other. They have divided the people, it is true, but the probability is, that we &s;hall &s;oon be on pretty good terms with both. We have rea&s;on to hope that our Envoys will be well received; if not, the good we have already received from the appoint|ment is more than a balance for the expen&s;e.</P>
<P>ONE thing, that I cannot forbear mentioning, that tends much to exalt the character of our late beloved Pre&s;ident, is, the impartial world, that have been acquainted with his public movements of every kind, and have had opportunity to ex|amine all his motives, have not in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, that I recollect, condemned his conduct; and I doubt not, but that we &s;hall hear, that his death is con&s;idered as a lo&s;s to the human race.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="036897_0013_100B2EE20AA5E038">MOSES was a man of piety, religion and moral|ity. And &s;o was WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>HE was never heard vauntingly to &s;ay, My wi&s;|dom, my courage, my zeal, have vanqui&s;hed all my enemies. My arm hath gotten me the victory.</P>
<P>ON the other hand; My God, my officers, my &s;oldiers, the good &s;en&s;e and firm conduct of my fellow-citizens, in the cabinet and in the field, have crowned my labours with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, was the language of his heart and his lips. He was no &s;ophi&s;t, nor athei&s;t. If he had been, his exam|ple might have done infinite harm; it might have given a tone to the faith and manners of the na|tion. The prevalence of infidelity in Europe, we have rea&s;on to hope, will be followed with &s;ome happy con&s;equences. It has nearly extirpated that &s;pirit of credulity and &s;uper&s;tition which for a long time di&s;graced the Chri&s;tian religion and threatned its total de&s;truction. In plucking up the tares, in popi&s;h countries, the wheat has been plucked up with them. The tares were &s;o numerous and &s;o rank, that this could not be well avoided. Thanks to Heaven! the good &s;eed is not lo&s;t, the ground remains, and we are not without hope, that it may be prepared in &s;uch manner, that when the good &s;eed is &s;own, it &s;hall bring forth an hundred fold. If the ways of Heaven are often dark and un&s;earchable, one thing is certain, the general good is invariably pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome things, the Jewi&s;h lawgiver and the American chief bore but little re&s;emblance. Mo&s;es had only to follow the directions of an infallible Guide. His path was &s;o plainly marked by Heaven,
<PB N="14" REF="036897_0014_100B2EE4444809F0">
that it was nearly impo&s;&s;ible for him to mi&s;take it. Not &s;o with our patron and friend: he was obli|ged to keep his invention always upon the rack. Not a moment was allowed him for relaxation and repo&s;e beyond what nature ab&s;olutely requir|ed. He was as thoughtful on the day of victory as on the day of defeat. Orders, it is true, he often received, but of nece&s;&s;ity they mu&s;t be often di&s;cretionary, e&s;pecially as to ways and means of carrying them into execution. He might find him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;regarding them; to do this, in his re&s;pon&s;ible &s;ituation, might be as painful to him, as it was to our Envoys in France when they were negotiating a peace with Britain. It is true, he was allowed to depart from orders, as circum&s;tances or imperious nece&s;&s;ity demanded; but to be always ready to take the advantage of circum&s;tances, required continual attention.</P>
<P>THIS one thing, the taking advantage of cir|cum&s;tances, di&s;tingui&s;hes the character of a general more, perhaps, than any other that can be named. Without a good &s;hare of prudence of this kind, the mo&s;t brilliant talents, in other re&s;pects, will never command &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>MOSES was con&s;tantly aided by miracles. The elements were at his command, the heavens fought in his favour. WASHINGTON had no di|rect a&s;&s;urance from the Deity, that he would lead him on to victory, and crown his labours with &s;ucce&s;s. He believed his cau&s;e to be ju&s;t, but this afforded him no ab&s;olute &s;ecurity again&s;t di&s;ap|pointments. If he had owned the <HI>box</HI> early in life, that he returned to the Donor at his death, this would have convinced him, if conviction was
<PB N="15" REF="036897_0015_100B2EE5ED693E80">
wanted, that the mo&s;t prudent, patriotic and brave, may be unfortunate, and &s;uffer an ignominious death. He never expected that miracles would be wrought in his favour. He could not &s;ay as Mo&s;es did, when hemmed in on every &s;ide, <HI>Stand &s;till and &s;ee the &s;alvation of God.</HI> At the &s;ame time, he and we, in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, have noticed the hand of Heaven vi&s;ibly di&s;played in our favour. My time will not allow me to de&s;cend to particu|lar in&s;tances, that made a deep impre&s;&s;ion at the moment, on the minds of &s;uch as then lived, and never will be forgotten.</P>
<P>THE gift, or rather loan of &s;uch a man, in our particular circum&s;tances, was a favour beyond e&s;|timation. If we had been allowed to &s;earch the world, one more &s;uitable to the exigencies of the times, we have good rea&s;on to believe, could not have been found. That he was continued &s;o long, and made &s;o u&s;eful to the la&s;t day of his life, de|mands our warme&s;t gratitude. Though it was never our wi&s;h, that he &s;hould pa&s;s through a &s;ec|ond childhood, and &s;pend the la&s;t of life in a u&s;e|le&s;s way, bereft of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and of &s;en&s;e; yet his re|moval at the pre&s;ent period is a lo&s;s, that we have great rea&s;on to lament. The conduct of the Uni|ted States this day evinces beyond contradiction, that they are &s;en&s;ible of the lo&s;s they have &s;u&s;tained. Were he, who wept at the grave of Lazarus, with us at the pre&s;ent moment, he would undoubtedly mingle his tears with ours. We commend rulers and people for devoting this day to mourning. Our public conduct has a tendency to wipe off the reproach that has been frequently ca&s;t on republics, <HI>that they are ungrateful.</HI> Pecuniary rewards for his

&s;ervices he would never receive. To perpetuate the memory of his virtues, is all the reward we are allowed to give. To benefit the decea&s;ed we do not expect; he is gone beyond our reach. To promote the happine&s;s of the living, the ri&s;ing generation in particular, and the children yet un|born, is what we have in view. We &s;ay to all, this day, who wi&s;h to live beloved and die lament|ed, <HI>"Go and do likewi&s;e."</HI></P>
<P>ALL orders of men may in &s;ome degree be ben|efited by his example, let their &s;phere of life be what it may. He was as exemplary in private life as he was in public. His example has made that line of life honorable, which, as we expect to become a great and flouri&s;hing people mu&s;t be at|tended to beyond all others. Commerce we &s;hall have, but commerce in &s;uch a country as this, without agriculture, can never be gainful. A price is put into our hands, God grant that we may have wi&s;dom to improve it.</P>
<P>Let us all take the warning that is given us. In a &s;hort time we &s;hall all be upon a level. As we wi&s;h to be lamented when dead, it behoves us to be u&s;eful while living. To prepare for our pa&s;&s;age is the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of time. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the dead who die in the Lord, they re&s;t from their labours and their works do follow them.</HI></P>
