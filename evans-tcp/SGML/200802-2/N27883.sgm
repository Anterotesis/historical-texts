<P>"YOUR condition, as to this world is indeed very low," replied the good Divine. "But what are mines, dungeons or gallies, to that eternal hopele&s;s pri|&s;on to which your unrepented &s;in mu&s;t &s;oon have con&s;igned you. Even in this gloomy pri&s;on, on this bed of &s;traw, worn down by pain, poverty, and want, for&s;aken by your worldly friends, an ob|ject of &s;corn to tho&s;e with whom you u&s;ed to carou&s;e and riot; yet here, I &s;ay, brought thus low, if you have at la&s;t found out your own vilene&s;s; and your utterly undone &s;tate by &s;in, you may &s;till be more an object of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in the &s;ight of GOD, than when you thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> pro&s;perous and happy; when the world &s;miled upon you, and you pa&s;&s;ed your days and nights in envied gaiety and
<PB N="4" REF="037148_0003_100C83B15A5F3498">unchri&s;tian riot. If you will but improve the pre&s;ent awful vi&s;itation; if you do but heartily renounce and abhor your pre&s;ent evil cour&s;es; if you even now turn to the Lord your Saviour with live|ly faith, deep repentance, and unfeign|ed obedience, I &s;hall have more hope of you than of many who are going on quite happy, becau&s;e quite in&s;en&s;ible. The heavy laden &s;inner, who has di&s;covered the iniquity of his own heart, and his utter inability to help him&s;elf, may be &s;till re&s;tored to GOD's &s;avour, and be|come happy, though in a dungeon. And be a&s;&s;ured, that he who from deep and humble contrition dares not &s;o much as lift up his eyes to heaven, when with a hearty faith he &s;ighs out, <HI>Lord be merci|ful to me a sinner,</HI> &s;hall in no wi&s;e be ca&s;t out. The&s;e are the words of him who cannot lie."</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the &s;elf-aba&s;ement, the grief, the joy, the &s;hame, the hope, and the fear, which filled the mind of this poor man. A dawn of com|fort at length &s;hone on his benighted
<PB N="5" REF="037148_0003_100C83B15A5F3498">mind. His humility and fear of falling back into his former &s;ins, if he &s;hould ever recover, Mr. Thomas thought were good &s;ymptoms of a &s;ound repent|ance. He improved and cheri&s;hed eve|ry good di&s;po&s;ition he &s;aw ari&s;ing in his heart, and particularly warned him again&s;t &s;elf-deceit, &s;elf-confidence and hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>One day, when Mr. Thomas and Mr. Stock came to &s;ee him, they found him more than commonly affected. His face was more gha&s;tly pale than u&s;ual, and his eyes were red with crying. "Oh, Sir," &s;aid he, "what a &s;ight have I ju&s;t &s;een! Jolly George, as we u&s;ed to call him, the ring-leader of all our mirth, who was at the bottom of all the fun, and tricks, and wickedne&s;s that are carried on within the&s;e walls, Jolly George is ju&s;t dead of the jail di&s;temper! He taken, and I left! I <HI>would</HI> be carri|ed into his room to &s;peak to him, to beg him to take warning by me, and that I might take warning by him. But what did I &s;ee! what did I hear! not one &s;ign of
<PB N="6" REF="037148_0004_100C83B3C922FD40">repentance; not one dawn of hope, Agony of body, bla&s;phemies on his tongue, de&s;pair in his &s;oul, while I am &s;pared and comforted with hopes of mer|cy and acceptance. Oh, if all my old friends at the Greyhound could but then have &s;een Jolly George! A hundred Sermons about Death, Sir, don't &s;peak &s;o home, and cut &s;o deep, as the &s;ight of one dying &s;inner."</P>
<P>Brown grew gradually better in his health, that is, the fever mended, but the di&s;temper &s;ettled in his limbs, &s;o that he &s;eemed likely to be a poor weakly cripple the re&s;t of his life. But as he &s;pent much of his time in prayer, and in reading &s;uch parts of the Bible as Mr. Thomas directed, he improved eve|ry day in knowledge and piety, and of cour&s;e grew more re&s;igned to pain and infirmity.</P>
<P>Some months after this, his hard|hearted father, who had never been pre|vailed upon to &s;ee him, or offer him the lea&s;t relief, was taken off &s;uddenly by a
<PB N="7" REF="037148_0004_100C83B3C922FD40">fit of apoplexy; and, after all his threat|enings, he died without a will. He was one of tho&s;e &s;illy, &s;uper&s;titious men, who fancy they &s;hall die the &s;ooner for ha|ving made one; and who love the world and the things that are in the world &s;o dearly, that they dread to &s;et about any bu&s;ine&s;s which may put them in mind that they are not always to live in it. As, by this neglect, his father had not fulfilled his threat of cutting him off with a &s;hilling, Jack, of cour&s;e, went &s;hares with his brother in what their fa|ther left. What fell to him proved to be ju&s;t enough to di&s;charge him from pri&s;on, and to pay all his debts, but he had nothing left. His joy at being thus inabled to make re&s;titution was &s;o great, that he thought little of his own wants. He did not de&s;ire to conceal the mo&s;t trifling debt, nor to keep a &s;hilling for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Stock undertook to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all his affairs. There did not remain money enough, after every creditor was &s;atisfi|ed, even to pay for his removal to his
<PB N="8" REF="037148_0005_100C83B5F9282BF0">own town. Mr. Stock kindly &s;ent his cart for him with a bed in it, made as comfortable as po&s;&s;ible, for he was too weak and lame to be removed any other way, and Mr. Stock gave the driver a particular charge to be tender and care|ful of him, and not to drive hard nor to leave the cart a moment.</P>
<P>Mr. Stock would fain have taken him into his own hou&s;e, at lea&s;t for a time, &s;o convinced was he of his &s;incere refor|mation both of heart and life; But Brown could not be prevailed on to be further burden&s;ome to this generous friend. He in&s;i&s;ted on being carried to the pari&s;h work-hou&s;e, which he &s;aid was a far better place than he de&s;erved. In this hou&s;e Mr. Stock furni&s;hed a &s;mall room for him, and &s;ent him every day a mor&s;el of meat from his own din|ner. Tommy Williams begged that he might always be allowed to carry it, as &s;ome atonement for his having for a mo|ment &s;o far forgotten his duty, as rather to rejoice than &s;ympathize in Brown's misfortunes. He never thought of this
<PB N="9" REF="037148_0005_100C83B5F9282BF0">fault without &s;orrow, and often thanked his ma&s;ter for the whole&s;ome le&s;&s;on he then gave him, and he was the better for it all his life.</P>
<P>Mrs. Stock often carried poor Brown a bit of tea or a ba&s;on of good broth her|&s;elf. He was quite a cripple, and never able to walk out as long as he lived. Mr. Stock, Will Simp&s;on, and Tommy Williams laid their heads together, and contrived a &s;ort of barrow on which he was often carried to church by &s;ome of his poor neighbours, of which Tommy was always one; and he requited their kindne&s;s, by reading a good book to them whenever they would call in, or teaching their children to &s;ing P&s;alms or &s;ay the catechi&s;m.</P>
<P>It was no &s;mall joy to him thus to be enabled to go to church. Whenever he was carried by the Greyhound he was much moved, and u&s;ed to put up a pray|er full of repentance for the pa&s;&s;, and prai&s;e for the pre&s;ent.</P>

<PB N="10" REF="037148_0006_100C95BCB937BC50">
<HEAD>A Dialogue between James Stock and Will Simpson, as they sat at their Work.</HEAD>
<P>James Stock, and his journeyman Will Simp&s;on, as I informed my read|ers in the &s;econd part of the Two Shoemaker's, had re&s;olved to work toge|ther one hour every evening in order to pay for Tommy Williams's &s;chooling. This circum&s;tance brought them to be a good deal together when the re&s;t of the men where gone home. Now it hap|pened that Mr. Stock had a mighty way of endeavouring to turn all common events to &s;ome u&s;e; and he thought it right on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion to make the only return in his power to Will Simp&s;on for his great kindne&s;s. For, &s;aid he, if Will gives up &s;o much of his time to help me to provide for this poor boy, it is the lea&s;t I can do to try to turn part of that time to the purpo&s;e of promoting Will's &s;piritual good. Now as the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t of Stock's own mind was religious, it was ea&s;y to him to lead their talk to &s;omething profitable. He al|ways
<PB N="11" REF="037148_0006_100C95BCB937BC50">took e&s;pecial care however, that the &s;ubject &s;hould be introduced proper|ly, cheerfully, and without con&s;traint. As he well knew that great good may be &s;ometimes done by a prudent attention in &s;eizing proper opportunities, &s;o he knew that the cau&s;e of piety had been &s;ometimes hurt by forcing &s;erious &s;ub|jects where there was clearly no di&s;po&s;ition to receive them. I &s;ay he had found out that two things were ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the promoting religion among his friends; a warm zeal to be always on the watch for occa&s;ions, and a cool judgment to di&s;tingui&s;h which was the right time and place to make u&s;e of them. To know <HI>how</HI> to do good is a great mat|ter, but to know <HI>when</HI> to do it is no &s;mall one.</P>
<P>Simp&s;on was an hone&s;t good-natured fellow; he was now become &s;ober, and rather religiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed. But he was ignorant, he did not know much of the grounds of religion, or of the corrup|tion of his own nature; he was regular at church, but was fir&s;t drawn thither rather
<PB N="12" REF="037148_0007_100C95BEDB734860">by his &s;kill in p&s;alm-&s;inging than by any great devotion. He had left off going to the Greyhound, and often read the Bible or &s;ome other good book on the Sunday evening. This he thought was quite enough; he thought the Bible was the prettie&s;t hi&s;tory book in the world, and that religion was a very good thing for Sundays. But he did not much un|der&s;tand what bu&s;ine&s;s people had with it on working days. He had left off drinking becau&s;e it had brought Wil|liams to the grave, and his wife to dirt and rags; but not becau&s;e he him|&s;elf had &s;een the evil of &s;in. He now con&s;idered &s;wearing and &s;abbath breaking as &s;candalous and indecent, but he had not found out that both were to be left off becau&s;e they are highly offen&s;ive to God, and grieve his Holy Spirit. As Simp&s;on was le&s;s &s;elf-con|ceited than mo&s;t ignorant people are, Stock had always a good hope that when he &s;hould come to be better ac|quainted with the word of God, and with the evil of his own heart, he would become one day a good Chri&s;tian. The
<PB N="13" REF="037148_0007_100C95BEDB734860">great hindrance to this was, that he fancied him&s;elf &s;o already.</P>
<P>One evening Simp&s;on had been cal|ling to Stock's mind how di&s;orderly the hou&s;e and &s;hop, where they were now &s;itting quietly at work, had formerly been, and he went on thus;</P>

<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>How comfortably we live now, ma&s;ter, to what we u&s;ed to do in Williams's time! I u&s;ed then never to be happy but when we were keeping it up all night, but now I am as merry as the day is long. I find I am twice as happy &s;ince I am grown good and &s;ober.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad you are happy, Will, and I rejoice that you are &s;ober; but I would not have you take too much pride in your own <HI>goodne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> for fear it &s;hould become a &s;in, almo&s;t as great as &s;ome of tho&s;e you have left off.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pay every one his own, &s;eldom mi&s;s church, have not been drunk &s;ince Williams died, have hand|&s;ome clothes for Sundays, and &s;ave a trifle every week.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true and very laudable it is; and to all this you may add that you very generou&s;ly work an hour, for poor Tommy's education, every even|ing without fee or reward.</P>

<P>Well, ma&s;ter what can man do more? I fall this is not being good, I don't know what it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will the&s;e things are very right as far as they go, and you could not well be a Chri&s;tian without doing them. But I &s;hall make you &s;tare per|haps when I tell you, you may do all

<P>No Chri&s;tian! &s;urely, ma&s;ter, I do hope that after all I have done, you will not be &s;o unkind as to &s;ay I am no Chri&s;tian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>God forbid that I &s;hould &s;ay &s;o, Will. I hope better things of you. But come now, what do you think it is to be a Chri&s;tian?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! why to be chri&s;tened when one is a child, to learn the Cate|chi&s;m when one can read, to be confirm|ed when one is a youth, and to go to church when one is a man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e are all very proper things, and quite nece&s;&s;ary. They make a part of a Chri&s;tian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; But for all that, a man may be exact in them all, and yet not be a Chri&s;tian.</P>

<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, I am very &s;erious, Will. At this rate it would be a very ea&s;y thing to be a Chri&s;tian, and every man who went through certain forms would be a good man; and one man who ob&s;erved the&s;e forms would be as good as another. Whereas, if we come to examine our&s;elves by the word of GOD, I am afraid there are but few com|paratively whom our Saviour would allow to be real Chri&s;tians. What is your notion of a Chri&s;tian's practice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, he mu&s;t not rob nor murder, nor get drunk. He mu&s;t avoid &s;candalous things, and do as other de|cent orderly people do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is ea&s;y enough to be what the world calls a Chri&s;tian, but not to be what the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> calls &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why ma&s;ter we working men are not expected to be &s;aints, and mar|tyrs, and apo&s;tles and mini&s;ters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="037148_0009_100C95C2F61E85D0">
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are not. And yet, Will, there are not two &s;orts of chri&s;tianity; we are called to practice the &s;ame re|ligion which they practi&s;ed, and &s;ome|thing of the &s;ame &s;pirit is expected in us which we reverence in them. It was not &s;aints and martyrs only to whom our Saviour &s;aid that they mu&s;t "cruci|fy the world with its affections and lu&s;ts." We are called to "be holy" in our mea&s;ure and degree, "as he who hath called us is holy." It was not only &s;aints and martyrs who were told that they mu&s;t be "like-minded with Chri&s;t"&mdash; That "they mu&s;t do all to the glory of God"&mdash;That they mu&s;t renounce the &s;pirit of the world, and deny them|&s;elves." It was not to apo&s;tles only that Chri&s;t &s;aid, "they mu&s;t have their con|ver&s;ation in Heaven. It was not to a few holy men &s;et apart for the altar, that he &s;aid, "they mu&s;t &s;et their affec|tions on things above"&mdash;That they "mu&s;t not be conformed to the world." No, it was to Fi&s;hermen, to Publicans, to Farmers, to Day-labourers, to poor Trade&s;men, that he &s;poke when he told
<PB N="18" REF="037148_0010_100C95C54F63B280">them, they mu&s;t "love not the world, nor the things of the world"&mdash;"That they mu&s;t renounce the hidden things of di&s;hone&s;ty, grow in grace, lay up for them&s;elves trea&s;ures in Heaven."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this might be very proper for <HI>them</HI> to be taught, becau&s;e they had not been bred up Chri&s;tians, but Hea|thens or Jews: and Chri&s;t wanted to make them his followers, that is, Chri&s;|tians. But thank God we do not want to be taught all this, for we <HI>are</HI> Chri&s;tians, born in a Chri&s;tian country, of Chri&s;tian parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e then you fancy that Chri&s;tianity comes to people in a Chri&s;|tian country by nature?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it comes by a good education or a good example. When a fellow who has got any &s;en&s;e &s;ees a man cut off in his prime by drinking, I think he will begin to leave it off. When he &s;ees another man re&s;pected, like you, ma&s;ter, for hone&s;ty and &s;obriety,
<PB N="19" REF="037148_0010_100C95C54F63B280">and going to church, why he will grow hone&s;t and &s;ober and go to church; that is he will &s;ee it is his advantage to be a Chri&s;tian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will, what you &s;ay is the truth, but 'tis not the whole truth. You are right as far as you go, but you do not go far enough. The worldly advantages of piety, are, as you &s;uppo&s;e, in general great. Credit, pro&s;perity, and health, almo&s;t naturally attend on a religious life, both becau&s;e a religious life &s;uppo|&s;es a &s;ober and indu&s;trious life; and be|cau&s;e a man who lives in a cour&s;e of duty puts him&s;elf in the way of God's ble&s;&s;ing. But a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Chri&s;tian has a &s;till higher aim in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> follow Re|ligion even under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, when it may hurt his credit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> his pro&s;|perity, if it &s;hould ever happen to be the will of God that he &s;hould be brought into &s;uch a trying &s;tate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, ma&s;ter, to &s;peak the truth, if I go to Church on Sundays,
<PB N="20" REF="037148_0011_100C95C6ECC96C70">and follow my work in the week, I mu&s;t &s;ay I think that is being good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you, that he who does both gives the be&s;t outward &s;igns that he is good as you call it. But our going to Church, and even reading the Bible, are no proofs that we are as good as we need be, but rather that we do both the&s;e in order to make us better than we are. We do both on Sun|days, as means, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, to make us better all the week. We are to bring the fruits of that Chapter or of that Sermon into our daily life, and try to get our inmo&s;t heart and &s;ecret thoughts, as well as our daily conduct, amended by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;ure ma&s;ter, you won't be &s;o unrea&s;onable as to want a body to be religious always? I can't do that neither. I'm not &s;uch a hypocrite as to pretend to it.</P>

<P>Very true, Will. Twould be no proof of our religion to let our cu&s;|tomers go barefoot; but 'twould be a proof of our lazine&s;s, and we &s;hould &s;tarve as we ought to do. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the world mu&s;t not only be carried on, but carried on with &s;pirit and activ|ity.

<PB N="22" REF="037148_0012_100C95CA2A9F1260">has put godline&s;s and lazine&s;s as wide a&s;under as any two things in the world; and what God has &s;eparated, let no man pretend to join. Indeed, the &s;pirit of religion can have no fellow&s;hip with &s;loth, indolence, and &s;elf-indulgence. But &s;till, a chri&s;tian does not carry on his common trade quite like another man neither; for &s;omething of the &s;pirit which he labours to attain at church, he carries with him into his worldly con|cerns. While there are &s;ome who &s;et up for Sunday chri&s;tians, who have no notion that that they are bound to be week-day chri&s;tians too.</P>

<P>Why, ma&s;ter, I do think, if God Almighty is contented with one day in &s;even, he won't thank you for throwing him the other &s;ix into the bar|gain. I thought he gave us them for our own u&s;e; and I am &s;ure nobody works harder all the week than you do.</P>

<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>God, it is true, &s;ets apart one day in &s;even for actual re&s;t from labour, and for more immediate devotion to

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, ju&s;t as you do when you make religion a thing for the church and not for the world. There is no one lawful calling in pur&s;uing which we may not &s;erve God acceptably. You and I may &s;erve him while we are &s;titching this pair of boots. Farmer Furrow, while he is plowing yonder field. Bet&s;y We&s;t, over the way, whil&s;t &s;he is nur&s;ing her &s;ick mother.

<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, indeed&mdash;how can that be? Now you're too much on t'other &s;ide.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e a man's trials in trade being often greater, they give him fre&s;h means of glorifying God, and pro|ving the &s;incerity of religion. A man who mixes in bu&s;ine&s;s, is naturally brought into continual temptations and difficulties. The&s;e will lead him, if he be a good man, to look more to God, than he perhaps would otherwi&s;e do. He &s;ees temptations on the right hand and on the left he knows that there are &s;nares <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, this makes him watchful&punc; he feels that the enemy within is too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to betray him, this makes him humble him&s;elf; while a &s;en&s;e of his own difficulties makes him tender to the failings of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you would make one be|lieve, after all, that trade and bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="25" REF="037148_0013_100C95CBD857C408">mu&s;t be &s;inful in it&s;elf, &s;ince it brings a man into all the&s;e &s;nares and &s;crapes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Will; trade and bu&s;i|ne&s;s don't create evil pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;they were in the heart before&mdash;Only now and then they &s;eem to lie &s;nug a little&mdash;our con|cerns with the world bring them out in|to action a little more, and thus &s;hew both others and our&s;elves what we real|ly are. But then as the world offers more trials on the one hand, &s;o on the other it holds out more duties. If we are called to battle oftener, we have more opportunities of victory. Every temptation re&s;i&s;ted, is an enemy &s;ubdu|ed; and "he that ruleth his own &s;pirit, is better than he that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> a city."</P>

<P>I don't quite under&s;tand you, ma&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will try to explain my&s;elf. There is no pa&s;&s;ion more called out by the tran&s;actions of trade than covetou&s;|ne&s;s. Now, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to with&s;tand &s;uch a ma&s;ter &s;in as that, without carry|ing
<PB N="26" REF="037148_0014_100C95CD9311D218">a good deal of the &s;pirit of religion into one's trade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I own I don't yet &s;ee how I am to be religious when I'm hard at work, or bu&s;y &s;ettling an account. I can't do two things at once; 'tis as if I were to pretend to make a &s;hoe and cut out a boot at the &s;ame moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you both mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t to|gether. Nay the one mu&s;t be the mo|tive to the other. God commands us to be indu&s;trious, and if we love him, the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing him &s;hould be the main &s;pring of our indu&s;try.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> how I can always be thinking about plea&s;ing God.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppo&s;e, now, a man had a wife and children whom he loved, and wi&s;hed to &s;erve, would not he be often thinking about them while he was at work? and though he would not be <HI>al|ways</HI> thinking about them, yet would not the very love he bore them be a con|&s;tant

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I &s;ay fir&s;t one, then the other; now for labour, now for religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I will &s;hew that both mu&s;t go together. I will &s;uppo&s;e you were go|ing to buy &s;o many &s;kins of our currier &mdash;that is quite a worldly tran&s;action &mdash;you cant &s;ee what a &s;pirit of religion has to do with buying a few calves' &s;kins. Now, I tell you it has a great deal to do with it. Covetou&s;ne&s;s, a de&s;ire to make a good bargain, may ri&s;e up in your heart. Selfi&s;hne&s;s, a &s;pirit of monopoly, a wi&s;h to get all, in order to di&s;tre&s;s others; the&s;e are evil de&s;ires, and mu&s;t be &s;ubdued. Some opportunity of un|fair gain offers, in which there may be much &s;in, and yet little &s;candal. Here a Chri&s;tian will &s;top &s;hort, he will recol|lect, "that he who maketh ha&s;te to be rich &s;hall hardly be innocent." Perhaps
<PB N="28" REF="037148_0015_100C95CF4FECD3F8">the &s;in may be on the &s;ide of your dealer &mdash;<HI>he</HI> may want to overreach <HI>you</HI>&mdash;this is provoking&mdash;you are tempted to vio|lent anger, perhaps to &s;wear,&mdash;here is a fre&s;h demand on you for a &s;pirit of pa|tience and moderation, as there was be|fore for a &s;pirit of ju&s;tice and &s;elf-deni|al. If, by God's grace, you get the victory over the&s;e temptations, you are the better man for having been called out to them; always provided, that the temptations be not of your own &s;eeking. If you give way, and &s;ink under the&s;e temptations, don't go and &s;ay that trade and bu&s;ine&s;s have made you covetous, pa&s;&s;ionate, and prophane. No, no; de|pend upon it, you were &s;o before; you would have had all the&s;e evil &s;eeds lurk|ing in your heart, if you had been loit|ering about at home and doing nothing, with the additional &s;in of idlene&s;s into the bargain. When you are bu&s;y, the devil often tempts you; when you are idle, you tempt the devil. If bu&s;ine&s;s and the world call the&s;e evil tempers into action, bu&s;ine&s;s and the world call that religion into action too which teach|es
<PB N="29" REF="037148_0015_100C95CF4FECD3F8">us to re&s;i&s;t them. And in this you &s;ee the Week-day fruit of the Sunday's pie|ty. 'Tis trade and bu&s;ine&s;s in the week which call us to put our Sunday read|ings, praying, and church-going into practice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, ma&s;ter, you have a co|mical way, &s;ome how, of coming over one. I never &s;hould have thought there would have been any religion wanted in buying and &s;elling a few calves' &s;kins. But, I begin to &s;ee there is a good deal in what you &s;ay.&mdash;And, whenever I am doing a common action, I will try to remember that it mu&s;t be done after a godly &s;ort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hear the clock &s;trike nine&mdash; let us leave off our work. I will only ob&s;erve further, that one good end of our bringing religion into our bu&s;ine&s;s is, to put us in mind not to undertake more bu&s;ine&s;s than we can carry on con&s;i&s;tent|ly with our religion. I &s;hall never com|mend that man's diligence, though it is often commended by the world, who
<PB N="30" REF="037148_0016_100C95D31CFEAB20">is not diligent about the &s;alvation of his &s;oul. We are as much forbidden to be overcharged with the <HI>cares</HI> of life as with it's <HI>pleasures.</HI> I only wi&s;h to prove to you, that a di&s;creet Chri&s;tian may be wi&s;e for both worlds; that he may em|ploy his hands without entangling his &s;oul, and labour for the meat that peri&s;h|eth without neglecting that which endu|reth unto eternal life; that he may be prudent for time, while he is wi&s;e for eternity.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT From a late AUTHOR, on Detraction.</HEAD>
<P>SUSURRUS is a pious, temperate, good man remarkable for abundance of excellent qualities; no one more con|&s;tant at the &s;ervice of the church, or who&s;e heart is more affected with it; his charity is &s;o great, that he almo&s;t &s;tarves him&s;elf, to be able to give great|er alms to the poor.</P>
<P>Yet Su&s;urrus had a prodigious failing along with the&s;e great virtues.</P>
<P>He had a mighty inclination to hear and di&s;cover all the defects and infirmi|ties of all about him. You was wel|come to tell him any thing of any body, provided that you did not do it in the &s;tyle of an enemy. He never di&s;liked an evil-&s;peaker, but when his language was rough and pa&s;&s;ionate. If you would but whi&s;per any thing gently, tho' it was ever &s;o bad in it&s;elf, Su&s;urrus was rea|dy to receive it.</P>
<P>When he vi&s;its, you generally hear him relating how &s;orry he is for the de|&s;ects and failings of &s;uch a neighbour.
<PB N="35" REF="037148_0018_100C95D6DE3615C8">He is always letting you know how ten|der he is of the reputation of his neigh|bour; how loth to &s;ay that which he is forced to &s;ay; and how gladly he would conceal it, if it could be concealed.</P>
<P>Su&s;urrus had &s;uch a tender, compa&s;&s;io|nate manner of relating things the mo&s;t prejudicial to his neighbour, that he ev|en &s;eemed, both to him&s;elf and others to be exerci&s;ing a chri&s;tian charity, at the &s;ame time that he was indulging a whi&s;|pering, evil-&s;peaking temper.</P>
<P>Su&s;urrus once whi&s;pered to a particu|lar friend in great &s;ecrecy, &s;omething too bad to be &s;poke of publickly. He ended with &s;aying, how glad he was that it had not yet took wind, and that he had &s;ome hopes it might not be true, tho' the &s;u&s;|picions were very &s;trong. His friend made him this reply:</P>
<P>You &s;ay, Su&s;urrus, that you are glad it has not yet taken wind; and that you have &s;ome hopes it may not prove true. Go home therefore to your clo&s;et, and pray to God for this man, in &s;uch a manner, and with &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s, as you would pray for your&s;elf on the like occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="037148_0019_100C95D870E8F730">Be&s;eech God to interpo&s;e in his fav|our, to &s;ave him from fal&s;e accu&s;ers, and bring all tho&s;e to &s;hame, who by un|charitable whi&s;pers, and &s;ecret &s;tories wound him, like tho&s;e that &s;tab in the dark. And when you have made this prayer, then you may, if you plea&s;e, go tell the &s;ame &s;ecret to &s;ome other friend, that you have told to me.</P>
<P>Su&s;urrus was exceedingly affected with this rebuke, and felt the force of it upon his con&s;cience, in as lively a man|ner, as if he had &s;een the books open'd at the day of judgment.</P>
<P>All other arguments might have been re&s;i&s;ted; but it was impo&s;&s;ible for Su&s;ur|rus either to reject, or to follow this ad|vice, without being equally &s;elf-con|demned in the highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>From that time to this, he has con|&s;tantly u&s;ed him&s;elf to this method of interce&s;&s;ion; and his heart is &s;o entire|ly changed by it, that he can now no more privately whi&s;per any thing to the prejudice of another, than he can open|ly pray to God to do people hurt.</P>
