</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE affecting vici&s;&s;itudes of time are &s;o many, and often &s;o great, that to calculate their numbers, or e&s;timate their con&s;equences, is beyond the power of man. Of the&s;e, every hour is pregnant, and every moment brings forth, while day and night &s;pread them from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, and the revolving &s;ea&s;ons, from pole to pole. By the cea&s;ele&s;s progre&s;s of time, this world is continually pa&s;&s;ing; &s;tates and kingdoms are di&s;&s;olved, and the va&s;t arch of all earth|ly empire finally falls.</P>
<P>Expo&s;ed to &s;uch fluctuations as the&s;e, how vain for <HI>man to tru&s;t in man,</HI> or to <HI>make fle&s;h his arm!</HI> How incon&s;i&s;tent to look for durable enjoyments on the to&s;&s;ing wave of time! Coincident with the&s;e ob&s;er|vations, are the mournful tidings that announce, as with the voice of dreadful thunder, that Wa&s;hington is no more; a voice that &s;trikes the Continent into

<P>From the heavy news of our Hero's death, noth|ing can &s;o rationally relieve, as a dependence on Him who made us; and to break our deep &s;ilence, no words can better aid our tongues, than, <HI>How is the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed!</HI> The good, the great, the mighty Wa&s;hington is fallen! Nor did he fall alone: A political Father in the cab|inet; a Hero in the field of battle; the Deliverer of his country, and a Friend to man, fell and were en|tombed in Wa&s;hington. His name &s;hall be dear to us, and to our children&mdash;it &s;hall not, it cannot be forgotten in America. Under deep impre&s;&s;ions of the debt of gratitude, we owe the memory of the common Father of our country, we meet together this day to indulge a rea&s;onable grief, and drop a tear for him who is now no more. Contemplating the many ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, by the high in&s;tru|mentality of his valuable life; and the unequalled qualifications with which he was endowed for that end, we cannot help joining the Royal Penman of I&s;rael, in repeating, <HI>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed!</HI> Did David &s;ee a greatne&s;s in Saul and Jonathan? A greater than both is here.&mdash; Did he lament the lo&s;s of an Abner, as a General of high qualities, and a Prince fallen in I&s;rael? We lament the death of a General of far greater worth. Saul was given to I&s;rael in wrath; but Wa&s;hington to America in mercy. Abner was cruel&mdash;and in an unju&s;t cau&s;e; but Wa&s;hington in the cau&s;e of virtue, of rea&s;on, and of his country, was merciful. Did
<PB N="5" REF="037999_0004_100FB07188DA6738">
David indulge a rea&s;onable &s;ympathy with the Thou&s;ands of I&s;rael for the lo&s;s of their Leaders in arms?&mdash;<HI>How are the weapons of war peri&s;hed!</HI> As if he had &s;aid; Who &s;hall give &s;trength to I&s;rael in the day of battle? Who &s;hall wield the weapons of war with &s;uch dexterity as Saul and Jonathan? With what &s;uperior propriety may we u&s;e the emphatical exclamations: How is the &s;word of America fallen! Where is the man who&s;e pre&s;ence can enliven and rally her armies of defence like Wa&s;hington's?&mdash; Who with equal influence, can collect the forces of our different &s;tates into one?&mdash;Who with equal &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, magnanimity, and per&s;everance, could lead an undi&s;ciplined pea&s;antry, without arms or ammu|nition, again&s;t veteran troops, in &s;cenes of action, through toils, through dangers, and through &s;treams of blood; to victory, to triumph, to glory, and to peace? Who with &s;uperior wi&s;dom, could guide the car of &s;tate, when riding high amid&s;t the jarring el|ements of contending nations, foreign influence, do|me&s;tic divi&s;ions, and in&s;urrections?&mdash;When Thou|&s;ands of well-meaning Americans would have thrown them&s;elves into the bo&s;om of a di&s;orderly, hungry, and in&s;atiable nation, he wi&s;ely and faithfully &s;aved us from that de&s;truction. How, O how is the migh|ty fallen!&mdash;Bewail ye &s;oldiers the lo&s;s of your Gen|eral &mdash;Bewail ye citizens the lo&s;s of your political Father. Ye Fathers and Mothers, ye Sons and Daughters of America, bewail the fall of &s;uch an em|inent in&s;trument for your defence.</P>
<Q><L>Sunt lacrymae rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt. <BIBL><HI>Virg.</HI></BIBL></L>
<L>What mortal tidings pierce our hearts and ears!&mdash;</L>
<L>Tidings, extracting floods of public tears.</L></Q>
<P>But let not the tide of our grief &s;well to an im|moderate degree. Though the Hero of America is no more, the God that made him lives as the defence of his people; and gave Wa&s;hington a good old age,
<PB N="6" REF="037999_0005_100FB0742B0F02A0">
and made him u&s;eful to the la&s;t day of his life.&mdash; For my own part, though I bewail the death of Wa&s;hington, as the fall of the mo&s;t honored man on earth; it is a con&s;olation, that he &s;hall never be expo&s;ed to the contempt incident to the frailties of helple&s;s old age.</P>
<P>Waving on examination of the characters to which our text refers, and fully convinced the words are highly applicable to our decea&s;ed General: I &s;hall con&s;ider them as a proper &s;ubject, for illu&s;trating, Fir&s;t, The character of a great man: And, Secondly, That great men mu&s;t fall in death. After which I will conclude with &s;ome u&s;eful reflections. I am,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, To illu&s;trate the character of a truly great man.</P>
<P>We would ob&s;erve, that a great man mu&s;t be a virtuous man. All the greatne&s;s that any of the mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing characters ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, without virtue, is tarni&s;hed with vice: And vice has a meanne&s;s, be|low which no man can de&s;cend. The laurels of wicked men, however flouri&s;hing in the field of ac|tion, mildew and die, under the bla&s;ting influence of vice, whether in public or private life.</P>
<P>What is the greatne&s;s of the Alexanders, the Pompeys, the Cae&s;ars, and other celebrated warriors of antiquity? What is the greatne&s;s of many mod|ern Heroes? Where is their virtue? By what &s;pirit are they animated? They are mere Catalines, and con&s;pirators, in compari&s;on to truly great men&mdash; They have &s;ounding titles of honor&mdash;They are pro|fanely &s;till invincible&mdash;Conquerors of the world &mdash;Arbiters of peace and war&mdash;Defenders of their country, and the like&mdash;But in this, their names are tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity under the influence of a fal&s;e blaze.&mdash;Their true characters are di&s;gui&s;ed&mdash; Their &s;ecret de&s;igns are often ba&s;e and mean, though covered with all the refinements of intrigue, of art, and of eloquence. Could we examine their conduct, and the motives by which &s;uch are, and have been in&s;pired, we &s;hould find that unbounded ambition,
<PB N="7" REF="037999_0006_100FB076D6B7A0C8">
cruel domination, in&s;olent pride and in&s;atiable ava|rice were the incentives of all their enterpri&s;es, and the mean and poi&s;onous &s;prings of all their glory. A glory like this would be infamy to Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>A truly great man is in&s;pired with infinitely more noble motives: Motives flowing from a &s;en&s;e of moral excellence; founded on a firm belief of the &s;u|perintending Providence of God, and the reality of religion, as tending to meliorate the heart, ennoble and dignify human nature; and attended with an earne&s;t de&s;ire to e&s;tabli&s;h peace among mankind, as well as a reigning concern for the public good. At the call of God and his country, the great man buc|kles on his armor, leaves his delightful retirement, and enters the field of battle. The enemies he op|po&s;es are pride, violence, inju&s;tice, perfidy and de&s;|potic &s;way. To the&s;e he oppo&s;es a humble depen|dence on Divine Providence, in the exerci&s;e of be|nevolence, ju&s;tice and good government for man. With the&s;e, in the u&s;e of his weapons of war, he &s;ights again&s;t his enemy without revenge, conquers without haughtine&s;s, rejoices in triumph without in&s;olence, and gives God the prai&s;e. And while his hands are red with the blood of his enemies, his bowels melt, for the mi&s;ery of the victims of a ju&s;t vengeance, and his heart reverences that God who commands in the day of &s;uch a &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Numberle&s;s examples might be produced, from the experience of pa&s;t ages, to &s;hew, that virtue is nece&s;&s;ary to the con&s;titution of a great General. While the Roman Commanders, continued uncor|rupted by vice, their empire, according to the &s;ignif|icant expre&s;&s;ion of Daniel's prophecy, remained &s;trong as iron. The purity of their manners was one great cau&s;e of the &s;ucce&s;s of their arms; and the grandeur of their Commonwealth was the reward of their temperance, wi&s;dom, and national ju&s;tice. But how &s;adly the &s;cene is changed, when the vices and follies of their conquered nations infected the hearts
<PB N="8" REF="037999_0007_100FB0785E8B36C0">
of their Generals! Their iron immediately mingled with clay, the foundation of their government was &s;oon overthrown, their courage degenerated into cowardice, and their once renowned legions were put to flight by troops of undi&s;ciplined barbarians.</P>
<P>No one will deny that firmne&s;s and fortitude are nece&s;&s;ary for the formation of a great character. But where &s;hall we find them? The brea&s;t of the vi|cious is too polluted a re&s;idence for &s;uch noble vir|tues. "True fortitude is &s;een in great exploits, which ju&s;tice warrants, and which wi&s;dom guides; all el&s;e is towering frenzy and di&s;traction." A vi|cious Commander may be lavi&s;h of the lives of others, and fooli&s;hly throw away his own; but that can never give him any ju&s;t claim to the appellation in our text. The practice of vice de&s;troys the health of the body, and relaxes the vigor of the mind; fits the man for mean and mercenary actions, and tends to transform Heroes into effeminate cowards.</P>
<P>A truly great man &s;ubdues his own pa&s;&s;ions; is a|dorned with meekne&s;s and generous compa&s;&s;ion even to his enemies. Slavery is admitted on all &s;ides to break the &s;pirits of men, and equally unfits the human mind for the formation and execution of any great de|&s;igns. What greater &s;lavery, than to be &s;ubject to the licentious de&s;ires of a vicious heart; and to the boi&s;ter|ous commands of unruly pa&s;&s;ions? Solomon, that great and wi&s;e Prince, ob&s;erved, "He who is &s;low to an|ger, is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his &s;pirit, than he that taketh a City." A polite writer ob&s;erves; "A coward has fought; and a coward has conquered; but a coward never forgave." To the &s;ame purpo&s;e another ob&s;erves, to a &s;ucce&s;s|ful warrior, who had &s;hewn uncommon clemency to the vanqui&s;hed; "Before, you had conquered all the world; but now you have more gloriou&s;ly &s;ubdued your&s;elf."</P>
<P>A really great character engages not in war, from hatred and revenge: To pu&s;h a conque&s;t to the grat|ification
<PB N="9" REF="037999_0008_100FB07C5E28FA50">
of &s;uch mean and rancorous pa&s;&s;ions, is for|eign from his mind; and it is a certain indication of the contrary character. Humanity and benevolence are e&s;&s;ential ingredients of his heart: And &s;uch a General knows how to enlarge his glory, by &s;etting bounds to his victories. Nor is he more ready to encounter a haughty foe in arms, than he is to do him good when by his valor he has &s;ubdued him to his mercy.</P>
<P>A clear head and a penetrating under&s;tanding, as well as a firm, virtuous, and courageous heart, are nece&s;&s;ary to the con&s;titution of a great character. Without the&s;e, the mo&s;t virtuous and firm mind in high offices will be in danger of many errors. In|numerable are tho&s;e &s;ituations, both in the field and cabinet, in which there may be neither precept nor example to direct men's conduct. In &s;uch difficul|ties, if the fir&s;t men in a nation are de&s;titute of re|&s;ources in their own minds, they may become an ea&s;y prey, with their country, to the devouring &s;word of an enemy, the intrigues of foreign nations, or the de&s;troying influence of dome&s;tic factions, divi&s;ions, and "unrea&s;onable di&s;content." Men without any &s;ingular talents may walk &s;ecure, in private life, and be u&s;eful to their fellowcitizens; and &s;hould they be even vicious, the injury may be principally to them|&s;elves: But when men without virtue and firmne&s;s, without wi&s;dom and &s;agacity, are rai&s;ed to command in the field, or to important &s;eats in government; while the influence of their vice &s;lides, with an ea&s;y de&s;cent, to the moral injury of the community; their errors in public conduct ari&s;ing from pride and am|bition on the one hand, or from ignorance and want of judgment on the other, are productive of incalcu|lable calamities to their country. To this truth ma|ny examples in hi&s;tory, both &s;acred and profane, at|te&s;t. And to the confirmation of this truth; what a &s;triking contra&s;t there is, between our great and beloved Wa&s;hington, and the mighty plunderers and
<PB N="10" REF="037999_0009_100FB080277EC378">
tyrants of Europe! If the latter have any &s;afety for their guilty heads, from the ju&s;t vengeance of their own injured country, it is in the arm and power of de&s;potic &s;way; but the former had a &s;ecurity in the con&s;cious rectitude of his conduct, and in the heart and affection of his country, which no length of time, nor change, can con&s;ign to oblivion. The wickedly great, and fal&s;ely &s;plendorous tyrants of the earth, have their fears in life, and the cur&s;es of generations to come, in death; but our truly great Wa&s;hing|ton had our love in life&mdash;has our grateful remem|brance in death; and generations to come &s;hall ri&s;e up, and call him ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>To fill up a great character, knowledge of letters, of men and of the world is nece&s;&s;ary. Innumerable are tho&s;e occurrences in life, e&s;pecially in eminent &s;tations, in which ignorance or inexperience of the&s;e, betray either trepidation or ra&s;hne&s;s of mind, very incon&s;i&s;tent with illu&s;trious characters. Men inve&s;t|ed with high offices re&s;emble a city <HI>&s;et on a hill, which cannot be hid.</HI> Their elevated &s;ituation ca&s;ts a light around them, that exhibits equally to public view, their ignorance and their knowledge; their imper|fections and their worth.</P>
<P>To the&s;e I add, that a &s;en&s;e of religion is nece&s;&s;ary to the formation of a truly great man. To honor men, as completely great, who are de&s;titute of this high qualification, is certainly not judicious. The belief of the exi&s;tence of a Deity; our moral obli|gations to him; the immortality of the &s;oul; the importance of its &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are &s;o in|di&s;pen&s;able to the man we are de&s;cribing; that he who fails of this mental trait, fails of a really great mind, as much as time fails of being equal to eter|nity. He that conceives him&s;elf, according to our new philo&s;ophi&s;ts, as having done with life, when his breath is expired, mu&s;t labor under a meanne&s;s of mind, that levels him with irrational animals, in point of duration. This blacke&s;t of French infidel|ity,
<PB N="11" REF="037999_0010_100FB081ADE0C428">
de&s;troys the be&s;t motives for action, and mu&s;t at once unfit the mind for tho&s;e noble achievements that the man of real religion is in&s;pired to perform. He that circum&s;cribes the con&s;equences of his great actions within the narrow limits of a life that is but a hand breadth, or a &s;pan; mu&s;t fall as far beneath tho&s;e who act upon a theatre preparing for eternity, as this little opaque earth is inferior to the expand|ed light of heaven.&mdash;There is no compari&s;on. While the <HI>former</HI> as &s;oon as he is born, is beginning to die (and an attempt to act as a Hero may effect his death, and eternally bury his triumphs in non|exi&s;tence;) the <HI>latter,</HI> in dying only begins to live
<Q><L>"The life of Gods, O tran&s;port! and of man."</L>
<BIBL><HI>Young.</HI></BIBL></Q>
And &s;hould his death take place even in the field of battle, it &s;peedily tran&s;lates him to join uninterrupt|ed triumphs;
<Q><L>"Where momentary ages are no more!</L>
<L>"Where time, and pain, and chance, and death expire!</L>
<L>"Where Seraphs gather immortality,</L>
<L>"On life's fair tree, fa&s;t by the throne of God."</L>
<BIBL><HI>Young.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Of this la&s;t cla&s;s of Heroes, we tru&s;t was our be|loved Wa&s;hington: And to this, his patroni&s;ing re|ligion, his di&s;countenancing and reproving vice, his &s;trict regard for the &s;abbath, his attention to public wor&s;hip, with his re&s;pect for the mini&s;ters of relig|ion, and his own purity of conduct, atte&s;t.</P>
<P>That Wa&s;hington was not of the Heroes who confine their views to the limits of time only, and that he had a deep &s;en&s;e of the importance of mo|rality and religion, is very evident from his own language, recorded in his affectionate farewell ad|dre&s;s to the people of America; in which he has di&s;|played, in the mo&s;t ma&s;terly manner, "the dignity of his mind, and the unrivalled benevolence of his heart." Thus &s;ays this great man:</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037999_0011_100FB0845A845098">"Of all the di&s;po&s;itions and habits which lead to political pro&s;perity, religion and morality are indi&s;|pen&s;able &s;upports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patrioti&s;m, who &s;hould labor to &s;ub|vert the&s;e great pillars of human happine&s;s, the&s;e firme&s;t props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to re&s;pect, and cheri&s;h them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with public and private felicity. Let it be &s;imply a&s;ked, where is the &s;ecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if a &s;en&s;e of religious obligation de&s;ert the oaths which are the in&s;truments of inve&s;tigation in courts of ju&s;|tice? &mdash;Rea&s;on and experience both forbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail, in exclu|&s;ion of religious principles."</P>
<P>We have another te&s;timony of Wa&s;hington's pie|ty and regard for real religion, in the concluding pa&s;&s;age of his Circular Addre&s;s, at the time when he re&s;igned his military command; which we in&s;ert in his own words.</P>
<P>"I now make it my earne&s;t prayer that God would have you in his holy protection; that he would mo&s;t graciou&s;ly be plea&s;ed, to di&s;po&s;e us all to do ju&s;tice, to love mercy, and to demean our&s;elves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of mind, which were the characteri&s;tics of the divine Author of our ble&s;&s;ed religion; with|out a humble imitation of who&s;e example in the&s;e things, we can never hope to be a happy na|tion."</P>
<P>In fine, were I to give a &s;ummary of a real great man, I &s;hould &s;ay, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a virtuous, firm, nobly generous and intrepid heart&mdash;a clear and pen|etrating under&s;tanding&mdash;exten&s;ive knowledge&mdash;con|&s;ummate wi&s;dom and enterpri&s;e&mdash;unfeigned faith|fulne&s;s in high offices&mdash;a &s;incere concern for the public good&mdash;accompanied with a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of relig|ion, and the &s;uperintending Providence of God.&mdash;
<PB N="13" REF="037999_0012_100FB085E497AD00">
The&s;e are leading features of a great character. And if a &s;ingular dignity of manners and addre&s;s can add any thing to the above, they were all found in Wa&s;h|ington.</P>
<P>From good authority,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Fullerton, who re&s;ided ten years in the vicinity of Mount Vernon.</NOTE> I have been informed that in private life the General was regular in his family, to an exemplary degree. His words were few, his con|ver&s;ation was moral.&mdash;Ho&s;pitable to &s;trangers&mdash;Good to the poor&mdash;Sociable with his friend&mdash;Forgiving, though re&s;erved, to his enemy&mdash;An affectionate hu&s;|band &mdash;Kind to all&mdash;flattering to none&mdash;and familiar with few.</P>
<P>In viewing the mo&s;t illu&s;trious characters of other Heroes whether more ancient or modern, even their friends mu&s;t draw a veil of tenderne&s;s over &s;ome im|perfections in their conduct, while they applaud their virtues; but the character of our decea&s;ed General can bear a full examination, and appears &s;potle&s;s, as well as &s;plendid, in the &s;ight of his ene|mies.</P>
<P>The greatne&s;s and goodne&s;s of his mind evidences the care of a kind Providence towards America, in furni&s;hing him with &s;uch abundant gifts for per|forming high &s;ervices to his country. A ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his worth &s;hould excite the exerci&s;e of corre&s;pon|dent gratitude to God, who gave Wa&s;hington to A|merica; while the &s;ame reflection deeply affects our minds, under an impre&s;&s;ion of our important lo&s;s in his death.</P>
<P>In his death, <HI>the mighty is fallen!</HI>&mdash;that di&s;tingui&s;h|ed character which has drawn the attention, com|manded the re&s;pect, and excited the admiration of kings and conquerors in Europe; and filled the minds of millions in America with joy. His mem|ory &s;hall remain embalmed to po&s;terity, while the name of virtuous liberty &s;hall have any friends on earth. <HI>How evident in his death, that great men mu&s;t

Whence art thou? that with equal ea&s;e, and lordly pride, do&s;t throw the prince from his throne, and the pea&s;ant from his humble cottage? Art thou that cruel me&s;&s;enger, by who&s;e unrelenting power the loving mother and tender babe, the indulgent hu&s;band and beloved wife, are cla&s;ped in icy arms, and become the repa&s;t of worms and reptiles in the grave?&mdash;At thy control, the &s;oldier and the citizen lie in undi&s;tingui&s;hed ru|in; and a mighty Wa&s;hington mingles kindred du&s;t on a level with the lowe&s;t in the hou&s;e of &s;ilence. Is it at the doleful tolling of thy bell, O Death, that we hear the &s;ound of thy grating in&s;truments, covering the rich and the poor, the oppre&s;&s;or and the oppre&s;&s;|ed deep in the du&s;t, to awake no more, till the morning of the re&s;urrection? By the ample &s;weep of thine enormous &s;cythe, the nations are cut off; and the number of the living is far inferior to that of the dead.</P>

<P>To the propriety of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, the lan|guage of in&s;piration, and the experience of all ages fully a&s;&s;ent. Long &s;ince, the doom of man was an|nounced by his Maker; "Of du&s;t thou art; and to the du&s;t &s;halt thou return." Our fathers are not, nor did the prophets live forever&mdash;We are continu|ally informed that God will <HI>bring</HI> us <HI>to death;</HI> to the grave, <HI>the hou&s;e oppointed for all living&mdash;Man in his be&s;t e&s;tate is vanity&mdash;His breath goeth forth; to his earth he
<PB N="15" REF="037999_0014_100FB08C64737B60">
returns,</HI> and <HI>that day his thoughts peri&s;h,</HI> as to us. <HI>All fle&s;h is as gra&s;s and the glory of man is as the flower of the field; the wind pa&s;&s;eth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof knoweth it no more.</HI> Nor need we look for death only in the field of battle, in the billows of the ocean, nor in cities of pe&s;tilence; the air we breathe, the food we eat, are fraught with death, and have quivers full of the arrows of de&s;truction. To meet with death, we need not explore the wilds of the fore&s;t&mdash;expo&s;e our&s;elves to the inclemency of &s;tormy elements, nor wait years, and dread it only in old age; we &s;ee it in our common walks; it may follow us to our clo&s;et, it may arre&s;t us on the couch of repo&s;e; while it con&s;igns Thou&s;ands from the brea&s;t and womb to the congregation of the dead. We are ince&s;&s;antly &s;eeing <HI>man going to his long home, and the mourners going about the &s;treets.</HI></P>
<P>Let us then improve the &s;olemn di&s;pen&s;ation that has called us together, as an incitement to prepare for our own death. Let us <HI>number our days &s;o that we may apply our hearts unto wi&s;dom.</HI> The Proprietor of time has now clo&s;ed another annual circle of days and months, and brought us to the beginning of that year, with which he &s;hall &s;hut up the ample round of the pre&s;ent, and which terminates in the commencement of another Century. Under &s;uch important progre&s;&s;ions he has clo&s;ed the very u&s;eful life of our beloved Patriot. As we have received good by his life, let us now improve by his death. <HI>All things work together for good to them that love God.</HI> Let us be habitually and actually prepared for death. The di&s;appointments incident to us in the pre&s;ent world, are great and many. The changes that may come upon us in the pre&s;ent year may be &s;uch as our wi&s;dom can neither fore&s;ee, nor our power be able to prevent; though of the la&s;t importance to our|&s;elves and country. What may be hid in the womb of Providence with re&s;pect to us as individuals, who can tell? Who can a&s;certain his pre&s;ervation from
<PB N="16" REF="037999_0015_100FB08F5C6FF010">
death for one month, one week, nay, for one hour? A few minutes may involve the mind of mortal man in a &s;cene more important to him than Millions of worlds.</P>
<P>Let us then &s;ea&s;onably contemplate the unknown regions of immortality, and look out for the ap|proach of the king of terrors. Can any of us baffle the power of death, &s;ince Wa&s;hington is dead? Can honor, can affluence, can love of friends or of coun|try, can an a&s;&s;emblage of virtues, or u&s;efulne&s;s in the world, can health of body, or &s;trength of mind &s;ave us from death, &s;ince He is no more? Can dignity of addre&s;s, a commanding appearance, added to the mo&s;t brilliant achievements and the mo&s;t &s;plendid triumphs, avert the arrows of that inevitable Archer, &s;ince they have pierced the life of the highe&s;t Hero of America and of the world? Will death re&s;pect the mo&s;t &s;hining dre&s;s, the epaulette, the lace, the &s;word or &s;uperb habitation; &s;ince the &s;hroud, the coffin, and the grave were prepared for Wa&s;hington? Can our feeble efforts re&s;i&s;t the arre&s;t of death, &s;ince that arm which (under God) &s;ubdued fleets and armies, has yielded to its control. Under impre&s;&s;ions of that high command, "Be ye al&s;o ready," may we prepare to follow, <HI>having our loins girded about, and our lights burning, and our&s;elves like unto men that wait for their Lord.</HI> Let us look above, and beyond Wa&s;hington, to Je&s;us, the ble&s;&s;ed author of our religion, who has de&s;troyed death. In him, and in him only, we may glory over this king of terrors, and ri&s;e &s;uperior to his fears. In Je&s;us we &s;tand compo&s;ed at his ap|proach, and &s;mile at the &s;haking of his &s;pear. In Chri&s;t we may anticipate an enlightened chamber for death, and victory over the gloom of the grave. He has &s;tripped death of its terrors.&mdash;He is <HI>the re&s;urrection and the life.</HI>&mdash;In him, <HI>life and immortality are brought to light by the go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>Let us improve this high di&s;pen&s;ation, to guard us again&s;t every appearance of moral evil. To this le&s;|&s;on
<PB N="17" REF="037999_0016_100FB09104F33640">
the example of the decea&s;ed, as well as the con|&s;tant voice of in&s;piration, directs. Sin is the cau&s;e of death&mdash;<HI>Sin has entered the world, and death by &s;in.</HI> While the pride, avarice, and ambition of many great men in the world, &s;erve as &s;hades to &s;et off the character of our beloved Hero; that him&s;elf &s;hould not live, is a &s;triking evidence of the dreadful nature of &s;in in its mortal effects and con&s;equences over the be&s;t of men&mdash;We &s;hall never be <HI>truly</HI> immortal, until we be <HI>really</HI> &s;inle&s;s. And though &s;uch a high attain|ment, is not the lot of any, even the be&s;t, in the pre&s;|ent life; it is however, our duty to &s;hun &s;in as di&s;|honorable to our Maker, injurious to our&s;elves, and as greatly unfitting for an&s;wering the end of our crea|tion in this life, or enjoying real happine&s;s in that which is to come. It is only where there is no &s;in, that there can be no &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Let us al&s;o improve this mo&s;t humbling Provi|dence, by way of gratitude to God, that at the mo&s;t important cri&s;is our country ever &s;aw, we had not on|ly a Wa&s;hington alive; but a Wa&s;hington in the &s;trength of body, and vigor of mind, added to the de|gree of experience, which form the aggregate of hu|man life.</P>
<P>And when we contemplate the dangers to which the government of our country, has been, and is &s;till expo&s;ed, from foreign influence, intrigues, and do|me&s;tic faction; and at the &s;ame time realize our lo&s;s in being bereaved of the man who&s;e voice &s;tilled the tumults of in&s;urrection; let us be thankful to the &s;u|preme Ruler of the Univer&s;e, that our coun&s;el in the cabinet and command in the field, are committed to &s;uch able hands as an Adams, and a Hamilton&mdash;and let me add, to a Gilman, whom with plea&s;ure I men|tion as a &s;ignal favor and ornament to our State.&mdash; May we never be de&s;titute of &s;uch emblems and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors of Wa&s;hington to direct the affairs of our &s;tate and nation.

<P>WHILE I attempt, with humble dif|fidence, a di&s;charge of the duty, and acknowledge with cordial gratitude the honor a&s;&s;igned me on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; it affords me high &s;atisfaction, and produces corre&s;pondent freedom, that I ari&s;e to ad|dre&s;s a candid and enlightened audience, who&s;e minds are not &s;tained with impure adulation, nor that un|due devotion paid to departed heroes, in aeras of ig|norance and &s;uper&s;tition; nor hardened by that rig|id au&s;terity, and envious ingratitude, that in this in|formed age, would con&s;ign the characters and ac|tions of great men to oblivion. Encouraged by this happy &s;tate of intellect, in this numerous a&s;&s;embly; I am free to &s;ay, your re&s;pect for the memory of GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON does you honor; and your attachment to military order, and the government of your country, gives every good citizen plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Agreeably to the Proclamation of the Pre&s;ident, we a&s;&s;emble today, to commemorate our beloved Pa|triot's
<PB N="22" REF="037999_0020_100FB09E28C55120">
birth; to contemplate his illu&s;trious life; and to condole and lament in his death. What a high a&s;&s;emblage of different emotions of joy and &s;orrow, does the remembrance of his character in this view produce in our minds? An a&s;&s;emblage combining di&s;tant years, important events, and various achieve|ments.</P>
<P>On the 22<HI>d</HI> of February, 1732, our Friend, our Father, our State&s;man, our Hero was born&mdash;A day au&s;picious to the Columbian world! a morning on which a day-&s;tar aro&s;e in America!&mdash;an aera, which neither our children, nor &s;ucceeding generations &s;hall ever forget, till time expires, and days &s;hall be no more. Then was America honored! Then did Virginia, We&s;tmoreland County, and Wa&s;hington pari&s;h, become di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;pots of the earth.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had WASHINGTON arrived at the age of twenty years, than the happy influence of his valua|ble life, bedewed the frontiers of his native &s;tate. His di&s;cerning and grateful country clothed him with honorable commi&s;&s;ions, and ve&s;ted him with plenary powers for a negotiation with her enemies. In di&s;charging the duties of the&s;e youthful honors, he di&s;armed the &s;avage, and di&s;po&s;ed him for peace.</P>
<P>By his &s;uperior penetration and prowe&s;s, he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf a ble&s;&s;ing to his country, triumph|ing over Indian victory, in &s;aving the remains of Braddock's defeated army, from the wanton cruelty of a barbarous foe. The&s;e early and &s;ucce&s;sful exer|tions were ominous of the future toils and dangers he endured; by which he pre&s;erved his country from being a theatre of de&s;potic diver&s;ions for Euro|pean tyrants, to be a garden of liberty for the A|merican nation.</P>
<P>When the rights of freemen were variou&s;ly in|fringed in America; when the chains of Briti&s;h &s;lavery were cunningly hid in che&s;ts of tea; when a Gage, a Dunmore, with many others, &s;tood ready to rivet the &s;hackles, by which his country was to
<PB N="23" REF="037999_0021_100FB09FB157AEF0">
be violated; her cha&s;te cries reached his ears; he drew his &s;word which never delighted in blood, and determined to &s;ave her. Neither affluence of for|tune, nor the prejudices of Britain, high in his favor for pa&s;t &s;ervices, could produce a &s;ingle he&s;itation. He ri&s;ks all, for love of country, of liberty, and of man. This principle drew him from his beloved and peaceful retirement. This principle induced him to renounce a life of private ea&s;e and honor; in which he was di&s;tingui&s;hed as a Father to the father|le&s;s, the orphan's Shield, the &s;tranger's &s;tay and the widow's Judge; to be more eminently di&s;tingui&s;h|ed in the field of Mars, for his country's general &s;al|vation.</P>
<P>At that di&s;tre&s;sful period, when every moment &s;eemed pregnant with events more important than the productions of a century; we &s;ee WASHINGTON at the head of the American arms; elevated in &s;ight of the world, to the performance of command, perilous as <HI>riding the whirlwind,</HI> and arduous as <HI>di|recting the &s;torms</HI> of heaven. His name carried order and government among his friends; and &s;et bounds to the in&s;olence and arms of his enemies. The heights of Bo&s;ton can tell; and their warlike entrenchments can witne&s;s to his &s;uperior General&s;hip. The ab&s;ti|nence, the valor, the unwearied fatigues of Long-I&s;|land, York-I&s;land, and the Jer&s;eys; when WASH|INGTON carried his young and inexperienced coun|try in his arms, with her countenance heavy, and her heart like to break, are proofs, that he, only grew brave by di&s;tre&s;s, and collected &s;trength from di&s;appointments. Undi&s;mayed by the threats of angry elements, in the &s;torms of winter, and in the highe&s;t &s;wellings of the Delaware; unappalled by the &s;mallne&s;s of his numbers, with the increa&s;e of ev|ery want; and facing a powerful well equipt and vet|eran foe; he mar&s;halled his little ho&s;t; he fired their &s;ouls with love of liberty; and by a &s;ingle effort of his high genius crumbled the overgrown pride of
<PB N="24" REF="037999_0022_100FB0A2627CE738">
his enemies to the du&s;t. By this unexpected and &s;urpri&s;ing victory, he revived the de&s;ponding &s;pirits of his country and invigorated her feeble arm for the field.</P>
<P>By his wi&s;dom in war, he often &s;aved the blood of his countrymen; by retreats, triumphing over victory; converting the advances of his enemies in|to ambu&s;cades for their own de&s;truction; and con|vinced them, their conque&s;ts and &s;ucce&s;&s;es were tem|porary and vain.</P>
<P>When we contemplate our American Hero at Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth; how undaunted, traver&s;ing clouds of &s;moke, &s;eas of blood, and tempe&s;ts of fire!&mdash;His pre&s;ence &s;upplying ev|ery want&mdash;animating every &s;oul&mdash;bracing every nerve&mdash;and braving every danger. His voice in the hour of trial, was as &s;ight to the blind, &s;trength to the weak, courage to the fearful, and comfort to the dying.</P>
<P>Watched by the eagle eye of WASHINGTON, his enemies fly from City to City for re&s;t; and from State to State for territory, to no purpo&s;e. He &s;oars aloft, alternately checks and pur&s;ues; until the la&s;t exertions of his potent foe for fighting or fleeing, are exhau&s;ted. By a noble effort of his great abili|ties, and &s;uperior talents in command over our aux|iliaries from a nation <HI>then</HI> our ally; with the army of America, he finally forced his enemies to &s;urren|der to his clemency, as a Commander equally di&s;po|&s;ed to commi&s;erate the vanqui&s;hed, as to &s;ubdue tho&s;e in arms; and to convince the power of Brit|ain of the nece&s;&s;ity of turning her thoughts on peace.</P>
<P>The&s;e, my fellowmen, are but an imperfect &s;am|ple of the heroic lu&s;tre and &s;plendid achievements, by which he directed the arms of America; until he evinced her importance, and weighed her indepen|dence before an a&s;toni&s;hed world, in the &s;cale of Na|tions.</P>
<P>When the olive branch &s;ucceeded the glitter of
<PB N="25" REF="037999_0023_100FB0A443985190">
arms, and the &s;ound of indu&s;try and agriculture, the thunders of the field of Mars; the Americans be|held WASHINGTON with delightful admiration, re&s;ign|ing his high command into the hands of his beloved country, from whom he received it; and amid&s;t the applauding &s;houts of thou&s;ands, returning to Mount Vernon, with the prayers of Millions for ble&s;&s;ings perpetual to follow him. In the exerci&s;e of his high command, WASHINGTON convinced the wi&s;e, that he was more wi&s;e; the brave, that he was the mo&s;t brave; but in his re&s;ignation, the good, that he was the be&s;t. How far inferior are the Heroes of Eu|rope, the convul&s;ed &s;tate of her nations can witne&s;s.</P>
<P>But though WASHINGTON had retired to the peaceful &s;hades of private life; though America is deeply in arrears of gratitude for pa&s;t &s;ervices; &s;till &s;he looks to him, as the man that mu&s;t &s;ecure by his coun&s;el in the cabinet, that independence which he had gained in the field, by his &s;word. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing every qualification to fini&s;h the State&s;man, as well as the General, he is unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en Pre&s;ident of the Convention, which erected that noble &s;truc|ture, our federal Con&s;titution. What &s;agacity in rea&s;oning, penetration in judgment, and wi&s;dom in conclu&s;ion, guided the Convention over which he pre&s;ided, in rearing that &s;tupendous fabric, is fully evinced by the happy effects America enjoys under its roof. To this &s;trong hold (under God) are we indebted for pre&s;ervation from the fury of dome&s;tic faction; and from the conque&s;t of terror, and plun|der, of foreign nations. It is under the covert of this all-protecting edifice, that our gaols are not thrown open by the hand of violence; that our Judges are not torn from the bench of ju&s;tice; that our mini&s;ters of morality and religion are not drag|ged from their de&s;ks; that places of public wor&s;hip are not converted to play hou&s;es, nor our precious &s;abbaths to a French decade. It is under the banner of this &s;tanding te&s;timony of WASHINGTON'S abili|ties,
<PB N="26" REF="037999_0024_100FB0A5EE61CB68">
with tho&s;e of his copatriots, that we are &s;afe from the &s;torms of endle&s;s revolutions, con&s;piracies and intrigues; and that our wi&s;e&s;t &s;tate&s;men have not felt the dagger of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, on the floor of Congre&s;s. It is rallying round this &s;tandard of ra|tional liberty, order and government, that our citi|zens are not robbed, our hou&s;es not rifled, our fair not violated, our old men not mi&s;erable; nor our tender infants de&s;troyed on the point of the &s;pear. And give me leave to add, it is under the arch of this mighty building, that America &s;its yet in her own hou&s;e, with her children around her; and calls them happy. Happy will they &s;till be, if they real|ize it, for it is the order of the family.</P>
<P>When the federal Con&s;titution received the &s;anc|tion of the people, America looks again to WASH|INGTON, as the man, whom &s;he &s;till delights to hon|or; and as worthy of her highe&s;t confidence in peace, as well as in war. He is unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en to hold the chief reins of government. At his coun|try's call, atte&s;ted by the joy in&s;pired into all ranks of citizens at his election; he ro&s;e from his &s;eat of ea&s;e, on which he had been &s;carce allowed a moment's re&s;t; and in the exerci&s;e of &s;elf-denial for her good, bowed to her reque&s;t; and with a diffidence peculiar to a mind equally great in it&s;elf, and un&s;ullied by pride or di&s;&s;imulation, entered on his high office, with a dignified &s;olemnity unknown before in A|merica. How well he di&s;charged the duties of this high honor, the nations of the earth and the grate|ful heart of every hone&s;t American can witne&s;s.&mdash; His whole life &s;eemed to indicate, that a &s;pecial Prov|idence had rai&s;ed him up, and given him a rare a&s;|&s;emblage of virtues, and powers of judgment, to perform a complicated variety of important &s;ervices; in defending his country in war; and refining and con&s;olidating her government in peace. Like a fo|cus of light, in which all rays concentre; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed whatever was noble, virtuous, and good in man.
<PB N="27" REF="037999_0025_100FB0AB35EC2360">
To our American Hero, as to the greate&s;t of mor|tals, has been, allotted the highe&s;t prize of human glo|ry, in running his race, without &s;tumble, &s;tain, or de|fect. The fame of his illu&s;trious deeds has explored every region of the earth, and cro&s;&s;ed every latitude of the ocean. On WASHINGTON, as on a blazing comet, in the firmament of human &s;tars, the inhabi|tants of the different Zones have had their eyes e|qually &s;et; and whether friends or enemies to A|merica, have been his equal admirers. His name &s;hall remain in the archives of the world, till the re|cords of time &s;hall cea&s;e; and the &s;ublime poet, the lively limner, the curious engraver, and every artifi|cer of monumental remembrance, will be proud to ex|hibit the mo&s;t lively &s;troke of ta&s;te, and the be&s;t te&s;ti|mony of invention, to perpetuate the memory of WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>His &s;word &s;hall be the delight of the brave, and the wonder of the warrior, while arms are in u&s;e. And while earth is the habitation of man, the trav|eller &mdash;Indian&mdash;Foreigner&mdash;or American; as he pa&s;&s;|es Mount Vernon, will &s;top; make a &s;olemn pau&s;e! and his commemorating &s;oliloquy &s;hall be, There is the honored re&s;idence of the FATHER of his Country, the DEFENDER of her Rights, and the BENEFACTOR of man. When the good, the great, the learned, or illiterate, the &s;oldier or citizen, look at the tomb of WASHINGTON, they will drop the generous tear on his urn, while the memory of his virtues and valor enlivens their innate re&s;pect for his du&s;t and a&s;hes.</P>
<P>But alas, he is no more! We are bereaved of WASHINGTON forever! For this, our country utters her groans of grief, and is deeply &s;orry. For this, the chair of her &s;tate, and the de&s;k of her temple are &s;hrouded in &s;able&mdash;For this, the hilt of her &s;word, and the arm of her citizen, are clothed in crape&mdash; For this, her drums are muffled, her trumpets are hoar&s;e, and her mu&s;ic mourns. And for this her national fortitude &s;tands this day in arms rever&s;ed,
<PB N="28" REF="037999_0026_100FB0AF01CB55D8">
not a&s;hamed of the tear of heavy wo on her cheek. Let us condole with her. If our hearts are not ada|mant; if our eyes are not flint; they will melt, they will weep for WASHINGTON. To melt is plea&s;ant, to weep is manly; to forget him is ingratitude of the blacke&s;t hue; and to be indifferent under &s;uch a high di&s;pen&s;ation, is impious in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>At his birth, the pillars of tyranny trembled; in his life, kings and conquerors darkened under his &s;uperior lu&s;tre; and at his death, the nations mourn. If the united abilities that accompli&s;h the General, Patriot, and State&s;man, could have baffled the pow|er of death, WASHINGTON had never died. If the united prayers of the virtuous in America, from his Excellency ADAMS, to the lowe&s;t citizen, could have availed, WASHINGTON were yet alive. And the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive tokens of re&s;pect, from the fir&s;t characters in the different quarters of the world, to WASHING|TON, authorize me to &s;ay; that if the de&s;ires of the good and the great, in Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa, added to the tears of the tawny tribes to the we&s;tern Ocean, could have &s;oftened the king of terrors, our AMERICAN CHIEF were yet &s;pared.

<P>Were an enemy to invade our coa&s;ts, wide as the &s;ea, is the breach made in our army by his death; and to tho&s;e who realized his worth in the day of danger, heart-rending indeed is that di&s;pen&s;ation by which the Deliverer of our country, the Founder of our government, and the Bulwark of our nation, is
<PB N="29" REF="037999_0027_100FB0B0ADCD76C0">
hid forever from our &s;ight. Had this awful Provi|dence taken place in America, when his arm was her &s;upport in the field of &s;truggle and di&s;tre&s;s; and when one &s;tumble in his walk would have made her heart tremble, and her countenance &s;ad; who can &s;ay, that we, with our little ones, might not &s;it to|day, under the darkne&s;s of monarchial government, in the &s;ackcloth of &s;lavery. Thank Heaven, it was otherwi&s;e ordered; and while &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the high decree of his decea&s;e &s;hould humble every American in the du&s;t, every heart &s;hould mingle gratitude with mourning, that heaven has &s;pared his illu&s;tri|ous life &s;o long.</P>
<P>Let us not forget the memory of our beloved WASHINGTON; and it will not cea&s;e to do us good. In his life, we have a combination of examples for all cla&s;&s;es of citizens, from the chief &s;eat of govern|ment, to the humble pea&s;ant. In the firmne&s;s of his integrity, wi&s;dom of his admini&s;tration, dignity of his manners, with his unremitted concern for the public good; we have a noble example for every de&s;cription of public officers. In the pious good|ne&s;s of his heart, illu&s;trated by the ju&s;tice, temper|ance, tender benevolence, and univer&s;al correctne&s;s and purity of his manners in private life; we have all an example in WASHINGTON for living; and in his magnanimous, re&s;igned compo&s;ure in death, a precious example for dying. The latter fully ac|cords with the former. General GEORGE WASH|INGTON died in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his rea&s;on, without a groan, though in extreme di&s;tre&s;s; per|fectly re&s;igned to the will of heaven, and ready to wing his way from this vale of tears, we tru&s;t, to the man&s;ions of bli&s;s, and endle&s;s repo&s;e. May a deep impre&s;&s;ion of our common Father's memory, excite millions of his exten&s;ive family to be like him, pi|ous, brave, virtuous, wi&s;e, and good!</P>

<HEAD>MEMORANDUM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS great man's ance&s;tors came from Old England, in the year <HI>1657.</HI> He is of the third de&s;cent after their mi|gration, the fir&s;t fruit of a &s;econd marriage; born on the <HI>22</HI>d February, <HI>1732,</HI> in the pari&s;h of Wa&s;hington, We&s;t|moreland county, Virginia. His Father's family was numerous.&mdash;His education was principally managed by a private Tutor, which has been often the ca&s;e in families of di&s;tinction in Virginia. His Father died when he was but ten years of age.</P>
<P>In the fifteenth year of his age he had determined to go to &s;ea; and had his baggage prepared for embarkation; but through the reluctance of his &s;urviving parent to a &s;eafaring life, he relinqui&s;hed his determination.</P>
<P>When he was in the twentieth year of his age, he was honored with a Major's commi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;In his twenty &s;econd year, he was inve&s;ted with plenary powers to negociate with the French and Canadians, who were making inroads on the frontiers of the Briti&s;h Colonies.&mdash;He fulfilled the de|&s;ign of his mi&s;&s;ion with &s;ingular indu&s;try, intelligence, and addre&s;s.&mdash;It is &s;aid his journals were publi&s;hed to the world and announced, at that early time of his life, the greatne&s;s of mind and correct manner of doing bu&s;ine&s;s, which have &s;ince characterized him in the management of more ardu|ous undertakings.</P>
<P>In <HI>1755,</HI> he &s;aved the broken remains of Braddock's defeated army, at Fort Duque&s;ne.&mdash;But innumerable, and too tedious to mention, were the hard&s;hips he endured, and the plans he devi&s;ed, to defend the frontiers during the war with France.</P>
<P>Peace being re&s;tored to the middle colonies in <HI>1758,</HI> and his health having been greatly injured by the war, he re|&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion the year following.&mdash;</P>
<P>After his health was gradually re&s;tored, he married an amiable widow of merit and wealth, with whom he has no i&s;&s;ue.&mdash;He was often cho&s;en by the &s;uffrages of his fel|low citizens to fill a &s;eat in the General A&s;&s;embly of Virginia. &mdash;He was Magi&s;trate in his county, and Judge of the Court.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="037999_0029_100FB0B3C47CC5F0">In <HI>1774,</HI> he was cho&s;en a Member of the fir&s;t American Congre&s;s&mdash;And the year following, Commander in Chief of the American Forces.&mdash;With what con&s;ummate abilities he formed a body of pea&s;antry to a regular army, and fit to en|counter the flower of veteran troops, remains unparalleled in the annals of pa&s;t ages, and will remain the admiration of the world for ages to come.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the war, he re&s;igned his command and retired to his &s;eat in Virginia&mdash;Multitudes thronged his pa&s;&s;age, both in city and in country, hailing him as the pre|&s;erver of their liberties, the giver of their independence, and the re&s;torer of peace.</P>
<P>In <HI>1787,</HI> He was elected a member of the Federal Con|vention, and its Pre&s;ident, while framing the federal Con&s;titution, under which we now may &s;o happily live.&mdash; In <HI>1789,</HI> he was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en Pre&s;ident of the U|nited States of America, and inducted into office on the <HI>30</HI>th of April, in the City of New York in the gallery of the federal Hall in the view of thou&s;ands of &s;pectators.&mdash; The oath was admini&s;tered by Chancellor Living&s;ton. Se|veral circum&s;tances concurred to render this ceremony un|u&s;ually &s;olemn&mdash;The pre&s;ence of the Father and Deliverer of his country&mdash;The impre&s;&s;ion of gratitude for pa&s;t &s;ervi|ces&mdash;The va&s;t concour&s;e of &s;pectators&mdash;The devout and reverential manner in which he bowed, and in which he re|ceived the oath; together with the con&s;ideration of his be|ing cho&s;en to the mo&s;t dignified office in America, and per|haps in the world, by the unanimous voice of more than three Millions of enlightened freemen; all con&s;pired to place this among the mo&s;t augu&s;t and intere&s;ting &s;cenes which have ever been exhibited on the theatre of time. A &s;pecta|tor of this &s;cene was &s;o &s;truck with the &s;olemnity of it, as an appeal to heaven and earth at once, that when the Chancellor pronounced, <HI>LONG LIVE GEORGE WASH|INGTON,</HI> his &s;en&s;ibility was wound up to &s;uch a pitch, that he could only wave his hat without being able to join one word in the repeated acclamations that rent the air.&mdash; To this office he was recho&s;en until he finally declined a re-election; at which time he formed an addre&s;s which for

wi&s;dom of policy, ju&s;tne&s;s of thought, per&s;picuity of &s;tyle and purity of language, is &s;econd to none, nor equalled by any. This addre&s;s is recommended to us now as the legacy of a political father to his family; and we are ju&s;tly told to read it, and to read it aloud that all the hou&s;e may hear.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The principal part of the preceding <HI>Memorandum</HI> is extracted from Dr. Mor&s;e's Geography, and is here in&s;erted for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who may have few means or opportunities of information on this mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ubject.</NOTE></P>
<P>We add; his care for his country's good is very evident in his la&s;t public act of conde&s;cen&s;ion in accepting the ap|pointment of Lieut. General of the American army; which office he has re&s;igned with his life; which we are informed took place as follows. On Friday, the day before he died, he &s;pent &s;ome time in marking a gravel walk which he had in contemplation, on the banks of the Potowmac.&mdash;There came a fall of &s;now which did not deter him from his pur&s;uit.&mdash;He continued till his neck and hair were quite covered with &s;now. He &s;pent the evening with Mrs. Wa&s;h|ington, reading the new&s;papers;&mdash;went to bed as u&s;ual a|bout nine of the clock&mdash;waked in the night very unwell.&mdash; In the morning finding him&s;elf &s;till &s;o&mdash;&s;ent for Dr. Craik of Alexandria. Soon after his arrival, two con&s;ulting Phy|&s;icians were &s;ent for, but all to no purpo&s;e.&mdash;His di&s;order would not yield to medicine; and by twelve of the clock at night on Saturday, the <HI>14</HI>th of December, <HI>1799</HI>&mdash;expired without a groan&mdash;in the <HI>68</HI>th year of his age. He &s;aid a few minutes before his death, "Bury me decently, and not till two days after my decea&s;e."&mdash;To Dr. Craik he &s;aid: "I die a very hard death, but I am not afraid to die."&mdash; Before he breathed his la&s;t, he laid him&s;elf on his back, placed his hands before him, and clo&s;ed his own mouth and eyes.</P>
<P>The&s;e extracts are from a letter &s;ent from a Gentleman of re&s;pectability in Philadelphia, dated January <HI>20</HI>th, who had recently returned, from Mount Vernon; after the General's death.</P>
