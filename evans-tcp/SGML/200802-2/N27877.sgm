<HEAD>BLACK GILES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>POACHING GILES lived on the borders of one of tho&s;e great Moors in Somer&s;et&s;hire. Giles, to be &s;ure; has been a &s;ad fellow in his time; and it is none of his fault if his whole fa|mily do not end either at the gallows or at Botany Bay. He lives at that Mud Cottage with the broken windows <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tuffed with dirty rags, ju&s;t beyond the gate which divides the upper from the lower Moor. You may know the hou&s;e at a good di&s;tance by the ragged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iles on the roof, and the loo&s;e &s;tones which are ready to drop out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">himney; though a &s;hort ladder, a
<PB N="4" REF="037142_0003_100D7C13D179F020">
hod of mortar, and half an hour's lei|&s;ure time would have prevented all this, and made the little dwelling tight enough. But as Giles had never learnt any thing that was good, &s;o he did not know the value of &s;uch u&s;eful &s;ayings as, that <HI>"a tile in time saves nine."</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, Giles fell into that common mi&s;take, that a beggarly look|ing cottage, and filthy ragged children rai&s;ed mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, and of cour&s;e drew mo&s;t charity. But as cunning as he was in other things, he was out in his reckoning here, for it is neatne&s;s, hou&s;ewifery, and a decent appearance which draws the kindne&s;s of the rich and charitable, while they turn away di&s;gu&s;ted from filth and lazine&s;s; not out of pride, but becau&s;e they &s;ee that it is next to impo&s;&s;ible to mend the condition of tho&s;e who degrade them|&s;elves by dirt and &s;loth.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="037142_0003_100D7C13D179F020">
The common on which Giles's hovel &s;tands is quite a deep mar&s;h in a wet winter, but in &s;ummer it looks pretty enough. To be &s;ure it would be ra|ther convenient when one pa&s;&s;es that way in a carriage if one of the children would run out and open the gate, as it would &s;ave the po&s;t boy from getting off, which is not very &s;afe for the people within the chai&s;e; but in&s;tead of any <HI>one</HI> of the&s;e children running out as &s;oon as they hear the wheels, which would be quite time enough, what does Giles do, but &s;et all his ragged brats, with dirty faces, matted locks, and naked feet and legs, to lie all day upon a &s;and bank hard by the gate, waiting for the &s;lender chance of what may be picked up from travellers. At the &s;ound of a carriage, a whole co|vey of the&s;e little &s;care-crows &s;tart up, ru&s;h to the gate, and all at once thru&s;t out their hats and aprons; and for
<PB N="6" REF="037142_0004_100D7C2077D94978">
fear this, together with the noi&s;e of their clamorous begging, &s;hould not &s;ufficiently frighten the hor&s;es, they are very apt to let the gate &s;lap full a|gain&s;t you, before you are half way through, in their eager &s;cuffle to &s;natch from each other the half-pence which you may have thrown out to them. I know two ladies who were one day very near being killed by the&s;e abomi|nable tricks.</P>
<P>Thus five or &s;ix little idle crea|tures, who might be earning a trifle by knitting at home; who might be u&s;eful to the public by working in the field, and who might a&s;&s;i&s;t their fami|lies by learning to get their bread twenty hone&s;t ways, are &s;uffered to lie about all day, in the hope of a few chance halfpence, which after all they are by no means &s;ure of getting. In|deed when the neighbouring gentle-floks
<PB N="7" REF="037142_0004_100D7C2077D94978">
found out that opening the gate was the family trade, they &s;oon left off giving any thing. And I my&s;elf, though I u&s;ed to take out a penny rea|dy to give, had there been only <HI>one</HI> to receive it, when I &s;ee a whole family e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;o beggarly a trade, qui|etly put it back again into my pocket, and give nothing at all. And &s;o few travellers pa&s;s that way, that &s;ome times, after the whole family have lo&s;t a day, their gains do not amount to two-pence.</P>
<P>As Giles had a far greater ta&s;te for living by his wits, than his work, he was at one time in hopes, that his children might have got a pretty penny by tumbling for the diver&s;ion of tra|vellers, and he &s;et about training them in that indecent practice; but unlucki|ly, the Moors being level, the carria|ges travelled fa&s;ter than the children
<PB N="8" REF="037142_0005_100D7C2E77B43D18">
tumbled. He envied tho&s;e parents who lived on the London road, over the Wilt&s;hire Downs, which being very hilly, enables the tumbler to keep pace with the traveller, till he &s;ometimes extorts from the light and unthinking a reward in&s;tead of a re|proof. I beg leave, however, to put all gentlemen and ladies in mind that &s;uch tricks are a kind of apprentice|&s;hip to the trades of begging and thie|ving.</P>
<P>Giles, to be &s;ure, as his children grew older, began to train them to &s;uch other employments as the idle habits they had learned at the gate very properly qualified them for. The right of Common, which &s;ome of the poor Cottagers have in that part of the country, which it doubtle&s;s a con|&s;iderable advantage to many, was converted by Giles into the means of
<PB N="9" REF="037142_0005_100D7C2E77B43D18">
corrupting his whole family, for his children, as &s;oon as they grew too big for the trade of begging at the gate, were promoted to the dignity of thieving on the Moor. Here he kept two or three a&s;&s;es, mi&s;erable beings, which, if they had the good fortune to e&s;cape an untimely death by &s;tarving, did not fail to meet with it by beating. Some of the bigge&s;t boys were &s;ent out with the&s;e lean and galled ani|mals, to carry &s;and or coals about the neighbouring towns. Both &s;and and coals were often &s;tolen before they got them to &s;ell, or if not they always took care to cheat in &s;elling them. By long practice in this art, they grew &s;o dextrous, that they could give a pretty good gue&s;s how large a coal they could crib out of every bag be|fore the buyer would be likely to mi&s;s it.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="037142_0006_100D7C31024A3268">
All their odd time was taken up under the pretence of watching the&s;e a&s;&s;es on the Moor, or running after five or &s;ix half-&s;tarved gee&s;e: but the truth is, the&s;e boys were only watch|ing for an opportunity to &s;teal an odd goo&s;e of their neighbour's. They u|&s;ed al&s;o to pluck the quills or the down from the&s;e poor live creatures, or half milk a cow before the farmer's maid came with her pail. They all knew how to calculate to a minute what time to be down in a morning to let out their lank hungry bea&s;ts, which they had turned over night into the farmer's field to &s;teal a little good pa&s;ture. They contrived to get there ju&s;t time enough to e&s;cape being caught in replacing the &s;takes they had pulled out for the cattle to get o|ver. For Giles was a prudent long|headed fellow, and wherever he &s;tole food for his colts, took care never to
<PB N="11" REF="037142_0006_100D7C31024A3268">
&s;teal &s;takes from the hedges at the &s;ame time. He had &s;en&s;e enough to know that the gain did not make up for the danger; he knew that a loo&s;e faggot, pulled from a neighbour's p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e of wood after the family were gone to bed, an&s;wered the end better, and was not half the trouble.</P>
<P>Among the many trades which Giles profe&s;&s;ed, he &s;ometimes practi&s;ed that of a rat catcher; but he was ad|dicted to &s;o many tricks that he never followed the &s;ame trade long. When|ever he was &s;ent for to a farm-hou&s;e, his cu&s;tom was to kill a few of the old rats, always taking care to leave a little &s;tock of young ones alive &s;uffi|cient to keep up the breed; for, &s;ays he, "If I were to be &s;uch a fool as to clear a hou&s;e or barn at once, how would my trade be carried on?&punc;" And where any barn was over&s;tock|ed,
<PB N="12" REF="037142_0007_100D7D1513677FB0">
he u&s;ed to borrow a few from thence ju&s;t to people a neighbouring granary that had none; and he might have gone on until now, had he not unluckily been caught one evening emptying his cage of young rats under Par&s;on Wil&s;on's barn door.</P>
<P>This worthy Mini&s;ter, Mr. Wil&s;on, u&s;ed to pity the neglected children of Giles as much as he bramed the wicked parents. He one day picked up Dick, who was far the be&s;t of Giles's bad boys. Dick was loitering about in a field behind the par&s;ons garden in &s;earch of a hen's ne&s;t, his mother having ordered him to bring home a few eggs that night by hook or by crook, as Giles was re&s;olved to have &s;ome pancakes for &s;upper, though he knew that eggs were a pen|ny a-piece. Mr. Wil&s;on had long been de&s;irous of &s;natching &s;ome of
<PB N="13" REF="037142_0007_100D7D1513677FB0">
this vagrant family from ruin, and his chief hopes were bent on Dick, was the lea&s;t hackneyed in knavery. He had once given him a new pair of &s;hoes, on his promi&s;ing to go to &s;chool next Sunday: but no &s;ooner had Rachel, the boy's mother, got the &s;hoes into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">her clutches, than &s;he pawned them for a bottle of gin, and ordered the boy to keep out of the Par&s;on's fight, and to be &s;ure to play his marbles on Sundays for the future at the other end of the pari&s;h, and not near the Churh-yard. Mr. Wil&s;on, however, picked up the boy once more, for it was not his way to de&s;pair of any body. Dick was ju&s;t going to take to his heels as u&s;ual for fear the old &s;tory of the &s;hoes &s;hould be brought forward; but finding he could not get off; what does he do but run into a lit|tle puddle of muddy water which
<PB N="14" REF="037142_0008_100D7D18E7657300">
lay between him and the Par&s;on, that the &s;ight of his naked feet might not bring on the dreaded &s;ub|ject. Now it happened that Mr. Wil&s;on was planting a little field of beans, &s;o he thought this a good op|portunity to employ Dick; he told him he had &s;ome pretty ea&s;y work for him. Dick did as he was bid; he willingly went to work, and readily began to plant his beans with di&s;patch and regularity, according to the di|rections given him.</P>
<P>While the boy was bu&s;ily at work by him&s;elf, Giles happened to come by, having been &s;kulking round the back way to look over the Par&s;on's garden wall, to &s;ee if there was any thing worthy climbing over for, on the en&s;uing night&punc; He &s;pied Dick, and began to rate him for working for the &s;tingey old Par&s;on, for Giles had
<PB N="15" REF="037142_0008_100D7D18E7657300">
a natural antipathy to whatever be|longed to the Church. "What has he promi&s;ed thee a day?" &s;aid he "lit|tle enough I dare &s;ay." "He is not to pay me by the day," &s;aid Dick, "but &s;ays he will give me &s;o much when I have planted this peck, and &s;o much for the next." "Oh, oh! that alters the ca&s;e" &s;aid Giles. "One may, indeed, get a trifle by this &s;ort of work. Come, give me a handful of the beans. I will teach thee how to plant when thou art paid for planting by the peck. All we have to do in that ca&s;e is to di&s;patch the work as fa&s;t as we can, and get rid of the beans with all &s;peed; and as to the &s;eed coming up or not, that is no bu&s;ine&s;s of ours; we are paid for planting, not growing. At the rate thou goe&s;t on thou would'&s;t not get &s;ix-pence to|night. Come along, bury away."
<PB N="16" REF="037142_0009_100D7D1AA89E7000">
So &s;aying, he took his hatful of the &s;eed, and where Dick had been or|dered to &s;et one bean, Giles buried a dozen. So the beans were &s;oon out. But though the peck was em|tied, the ground was unplanted. But cunning Giles knew this could not be found out till the time when the beans might be expected to come up, "and then Dick," &s;aid he, "the &s;nails and the mice may go &s;hares in the blame; or we can lay the fault on the rooks or the black|birds." So &s;aying, he &s;ent the boy into the Par&s;onage to receive his pay, taking care to &s;ecure about a quarter of the peck of beans for his own colt; he put both bag and beans into his own pocket to carry home, bidding Dick tell Mr. Wil|&s;on that he had planted the beans and lo&s;t the bag.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="037142_0009_100D7D1AA89E7000">
In the mean time Giles's other boys were bu&s;y in emtying the ponds and trout-&s;treams in the neighbour|ing manor. They would &s;teal away the carp and tench when they were no bigger than gudgeons; by this untimely depredation they plundered the owner without enriching them|&s;elves. But the plea&s;ure of mi&s;|chief was reward enough. The&s;e and a hundred other little thieveries, they committed with &s;uch dexterity, that old Tim Crib, who&s;e &s;on was tran&s;ported la&s;t a&s;&s;izes for &s;heep &s;teal|ing, u&s;ed to be often reproaching his boys, that Giles's &s;ons were worth a hundred of &s;uch blockheads as he had; for &s;carce a night pa&s;t but Giles had &s;ome little comfortable thing for &s;upper which his boys had pilfered in the day, while <HI>his</HI> undutiful dogs never &s;tole any thing worth having. Giles, in the mean time, was bu&s;y in
<PB N="18" REF="037142_0010_100D7D1C567F4AE8">
his way, but as bu&s;y as he was in lay|ing nets, &s;tarting coveys, and training dogs, he always took care that his depredations &s;hould not be confined merely to game.</P>
<P>Giles's boys had never &s;een the in&s;ide of a church &s;ince they were chri&s;tened, and the father thought he knew his own intere&s;t better than to force them to it; for church-time was the &s;ea&s;on of their harve&s;t. Then the hens' ne&s;ts were &s;earched, a &s;tray duck was clapped under the &s;mock frock, the tools which might have been left by chance in a farm-yard were picked up, and all the neigh|bouring pigeon-hou&s;es were thinned, &s;o that Giles u&s;ed to boa&s;t to his wife, that Sunday was to them the mo&s;t profitable day in the week. With her it was certainly the mo&s;t labourious day, as &s;he always did her wa&s;hing
<PB N="19" REF="037142_0010_100D7D1C567F4AE8">
and ironing on the Sunday morning, it being, as &s;he &s;aid, the only lei&s;ure day &s;he had, for on the other days &s;he went about the country telling for|tunes, and &s;elling dream books, and wicked &s;ongs. Neither her hu&s;band's nor her children's cloaths were ever mended, and if Sunday, her idle day, had not come about once in every week, it is likely they would never have been wa&s;hed neither. You might, however, &s;ee her as you were going to church &s;moothing her own rags on her be&s;t red cloak, which &s;he always u&s;ed for her ironing cloth on Sundays, for her cloak when &s;he tra|velled, and for her blanket at night; &s;uch a wretched manager was Ra|chel! among her other articles of trade one was to make and &s;ell pep|permint, and other di&s;tilled waters. The&s;e &s;he had the cheap art of ma|king without trouble, and without ex|pence,
<PB N="20" REF="037142_0011_100D7D1E09041330">
for &s;he made them without herbs and without a &s;till. Her way was, to fill &s;o many quart bottle with plain water, putting a &s;poonful of mint water in the mouth of each; the&s;e &s;he corked down with ro&s;in, car|rying to each cu&s;tomer a phial of r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">al di&s;tilled water to ta&s;te, by way of &s;am|ple. This was &s;o good that her bot|tles were commonly bought up with|out being opened; but if any &s;u&s;picion aro&s;e, and &s;he was forced to uncork a bottle, by the few drops of di&s;tilled water lying at top, &s;he even then e&s;caped detection, and took care to get out of reach before the bottle was opened a &s;econd time. She was too prudent ever to go twice to the &s;ame hou&s;e.</P>
<P>There is hardly any petty mi&s;chief that is not connected with the life of a poacher. Mr. Wil&s;on was aware of this,
<PB N="21" REF="037142_0011_100D7D1E09041330">
he was not only a pious clergyman, but an upright ju&s;tice. He u&s;ed to &s;ay that people who are truly con&s;cien|tious, mu&s;t be &s;o in &s;mall things as well as in great ones, or they would de&s;troy the effect of their own precepts and their example would not be of general u&s;e. For this rea&s;on he never would accept of a hare or partridge from an unqualified per&s;on in his pari&s;h. He did not content him&s;elf with &s;huffling the thing off by a&s;king no que&s;tions, and pretending to take it for granted in a general way that the game was fairly come at; but he u&s;ed to &s;ay that by receiving the booty he connived at a crime; made him&s;elf a &s;harer in it, and if he gave a pre&s;ent to the man who brought it, he even tempted him to repeat the fault.</P>
<P>One day poor Jack We&s;ton, an ho|ne&s;t fellow in the neighbourhood,
<PB N="22" REF="037142_0012_100D7D218BDA1690">
whom Mr. Wil&s;on had kindly vi&s;ited and relieved in a long &s;ickne&s;s, from which he had but ju&s;t recovered, was brought before him as he was &s;itting on the Ju&s;tice's bench; Jack was accu|&s;ed of having knocked down a hare, and of all the birds in the air, who &s;hould the informer be but black Giles the poacher? Mr. Wil&s;on was grieved at the charge, he had a great regard for Jack, but he had a &s;till greater re|gard for the law. The poor fellow pleaded guilty. He did not deny the fact, but &s;aid he did not con&s;ider it a crime, he did not think game was pri|vate property, and he owned he had a &s;trong temptation for doing what he had done, which he hoped would plead in his excu&s;e. The Ju&s;tice de&s;i|red to know what this temptation was. "Sir," &s;aid the poor fellow, "you know I was given over this &s;pring in a bad fever. I had no friend in the
<PB N="23" REF="037142_0012_100D7D218BDA1690">
world but you Sir. Under God you &s;aved my life by your charitable relief; and I tru&s;t you may have helped to &s;ave my &s;oul by your prayers and your good advice. I know I can ne|ver make you amends for all your goodne&s;s, but I thought it would be &s;ome comfort to my full heart if I could but once give you &s;ome little token of my gratitude. So I had trained a pair of nice turtle doves for Madam Wil|&s;on, but they were &s;tolen from me Sir, and I do &s;u&s;pect black Giles &s;tole them. Ye&s;terday morning, Sir, as I was crawling out to my work, for I am &s;till but very weak, a fine hare ran acro&s;s my path. I did not &s;tay to con|&s;ider whether it was wrong to kill a hare, but I felt it was right to &s;hew my gratitude; &s;o Sir, without a mo|ment's thought I did knock down the hare which I was going to carry to your Wor&s;hip, becau&s;e I knew Ma|dam
<PB N="24" REF="037142_0013_100D7D2436A9BA88">
was fond of hare. I am truly &s;orry for my fault, and will &s;ubmit to whatever puni&s;hment your wor&s;hip may plea&s;e to inflict."</P>
<P>Mr. Wil&s;on was much moved with this hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion, and touched with the poor fellow's gratitude. What added to the effect of the &s;tory, was the weak condition and pale, &s;ickly looks of the offender. But this wor|thy Ju&s;tice never &s;uffered his feelings to bias his integrity; he knew that he did not &s;it on that bench to indulge pity, but to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice. And while he was &s;orry for the offender he would not ju&s;tify the offence. "John," &s;aid he, "I am &s;urpri&s;ed that you could for a moment forget that I ne|ver accept any gift which cau&s;es the giver to break a law. On Sunday I teach you from the pulpit the laws of God, who&s;e mini&s;ter I am. At pre|&s;ent
<PB N="25" REF="037142_0013_100D7D2436A9BA88">
I fill the chair of the magi&s;trate to enforce and execute the laws of the land. Between tho&s;e and the others there is more connection than you are aware. I thank you, John, for your af|fection for me, and I admire your gra|titude; but I mu&s;t not allow either af|fection or gratitude to be brought as a plea for a wrong action. It is not your bu&s;ine&s;s nor mine, John, to &s;et|tle whether the game laws are good or bad. Till they are repealed we mu&s;t obey them. Many, I doubt not, break the&s;e laws through ignorance, and ma|ny I am certain, who would not dare to &s;teal a goo&s;e or a turkey, make no &s;cruple to knock down a hare or a partridge. You will hereafter think your&s;elf happy that this your fir&s;t at|tempt has proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, as I tru&s;t you are too hone&s;t a fellow ever to intend to turn poacher. With poaching much moral evil is connect|ed;
<PB N="26" REF="037142_0014_100D7D262E7EFFF8">
a habit of nightly depradation; a cu&s;tom of prowling in the dark for prey, produces in time a di&s;reli&s;h for hone&s;t labour. He who&s;e fir&s;t offence was committed without much thought or evil intention, if he happens to &s;uc|ceed a few times in carrying off his booty undi&s;covered, grows bolder and bolder; and when he fancies there is no &s;hame attending it, he very &s;oon gets to per&s;uade him&s;elf that there is al&s;o no &s;in. While &s;ome people pre|tend a &s;cruple about &s;tealing a &s;heep, they partly live by plundering of war|rens. But remember that the warren|er pays a high rent, and therefore his rabbits are as much his property as his &s;heep. Do not then deceive your&s;elves with the&s;e fal&s;e di&s;tinctions.

brings them up to certain &s;in and ruin. He who begins with robbing orchards, rabbit-warrens, and fi&s;h-ponds, will probably end with hor&s;e-&s;tealing or highway robbery. Poaching is a re|gular apprentice&s;hip to bolder crimes. He whom I may commit as a boy to &s;it in the &s;tocks for killing a partridge, may be likely to end at the gallows for killing a man.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, you who now hear me, the &s;trictne&s;s and impartiality of ju&s;|tice. I know Giles to be a worthle&s;s fellow, yet it is my duty to take his information; I know Jack We&s;ton to be an hone&s;t youth, yet I mu&s;t be obliged to make him pay the penalty. Giles is a bad man, but he can prove this fact: Jack is a worthy lad, but he has committed this fault, I am &s;orry for you, Jack: but do not let it grieve you that Giles has played

wor&s;e tricks a hundred times, and yet got off, while you were detected in the very fir&s;t offence, for that would be grieving becau&s;e you are not &s;o great a rogue as Giles. At this moment you think your good luck is very unequal: but all this will one day turn out in your favour. Giles is not the more a favourite of heaven becau&s;e he has hitherto e&s;ca|ped Botany Bay or the Hulks; nor is it any mark of God's di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t you, John, that you were found out in your very fir&s;t at|tempt."</P>
<P>Here the good Ju&s;tice left off &s;peaking, and no one could contra|dict the truth of what he had &s;aid. We&s;ton humbly &s;ubmitted to his &s;entence, but he was very poor, and knew not where to rai&s;e the money to pay his fine. His character had always been &s;o fair, that &s;everal farmers pre&s;ent kindly agreed to ad|vance

a trifle each to prevent his being &s;ent to pri&s;on, and he thankful|ly promi&s;ed to work out the debt. The Ju&s;tice him&s;elf, though he could not &s;often the law, yet &s;hewed We&s;ton &s;o much kindne&s;s, that he was ena|bled, before the year was out, to get out of this difficulty. He began to think more &s;eriou&s;ly than he had ever yet done, and grew to abhor p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ch|ing, not merely from fear but from principle.</P>
<P>We &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee whether poaching Giles always got off &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully. Here we have &s;een that pro&s;perity is no &s;ure &s;ign of goodne&s;s. Next week we may, perhaps, &s;ee that the "tri|umphing of the wicked is &s;hort: for then I promi&s;e to give the Second Part of the Poacher, together with the entertaining Story of the Widow Brown's Apple Tree.</P>
