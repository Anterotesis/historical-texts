<P>VENERATION for the memory of illu&s;trious per&s;onages is a &s;entiment &s;o congenial to the human mind, that it h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s di&s;covered it&s;elf, in &s;ome way or other, in all ages and countries. In the days of ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orance and idolatry, when t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere was neither light to guide, nor authority to control the wandering imaginations of men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ancy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g their heroes, their law-givers and their &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, to be admitted to &s;ome &s;hare in the affairs of Heaven, they paid them divine honors&mdash;they implored their protectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;they deprecated their anger. This was even the ca&s;e among tho&s;e nations of antiquity, who had made con&s;iderable advances towards civilization and refinement. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hers who were deeper &s;unk in ignorance, or farther advanced in corruption, exhi|bited, in veneration of their admired characters, every practice that folly could &s;ugge&s;t, or &s;tupidity countenance.</P>
<P>The Jews, a nation &s;elected from amid&s;t the general corrup|tion of mankind, as a repo&s;itory of the truth, with their minds under the direction and control of laws and regulations dic|tated by Heaven, by no means aboli&s;hed the cu&s;tom of vene|rating the memory of the decea&s;ed, but only prevented this veneration from &s;hewing it&s;elf, by any &s;inful practices, or ri|diculous exhibitions. Nor does chri&s;tianity, the intention of which is not to eradicate, but to correct the natural propen&s;i|ties of the human mind, forbid, but even &s;anction, a rational re&s;pect, and long remembrance of the virtues and &s;ervices or great and illu&s;trious men. And then, with a benevolence pe|culiar to that lovely in&s;titution, it places every thing in a way to improve the hearts of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, to meliorate their condition

here on earth, and to prepare them for a &s;tate of more perfect happine&s;s, when this world and all its cu&s;toms &s;hall have pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed away.</P>
<P>The corre&s;pondence between the occa&s;ion which detained the I&s;raelites, thirty days in the plains of Moab, and that which has a&s;&s;embled us here this day, is &s;ingularly &s;triking. They had to lament their deliverer, their leader, and their law-giver. And how a&s;toni&s;hingly were all the&s;e characters united in the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat per&s;onage, to who&s;e memory we have this day met to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y our grateful tribute of re&s;pect!</P>
<P>Let us, only for a moment, advert to the principal circum|&s;tances of their lives, and the great events of their conduct.&mdash; When Mo&s;es was tending his flock upon Mount Horeb, he was called by God, to re&s;cue his nation from the rigor of Egyptian bondage. An encroachment upon the rights of his country called Wa&s;hington from his farm on the banks of the Potomac. It is true, the latter did not, like the former, hear the voice of God, but when he was appointed to command the American army, the mo&s;t hardy &s;ceptic will &s;carcely dare to doubt, that, in this appointment, Congre&s;s was directed by the finger of God. If ever there was a time, when the minds of this ve|nerable body of man were totally dive&s;ted of every pa&s;&s;ion&mdash; every intere&s;ted view, or ambitious project, and actuated &s;olely by the love of their country, it was at this momentous period. The gallantry, and profound military &s;kill, which he di&s;played, in re&s;cuing the remains of the vanqui&s;hed army of Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ddock from the unrelenting arms of a &s;avage foe, fixed every eye upon Wa&s;hington, as the fitte&s;t character to conduct the armies of America.</P>
<P>And here again, we have a wonderful coincidence between the manner in which the Deliverer of I&s;rael and of America accepted their commi&s;&s;ions. Mo&s;es, although he received his appointment from the Supreme Ruler of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, yet his mind was &s;o impre&s;&s;ed with the weight of the unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g, that he would fain have &s;hrunk from the ta&s;k. When the unanimous voice of his country called Wa&s;hington to command, his &s;oul, great as it was, labored under the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;o va&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de&s;ign, and had not a ruling maxim of his life, &s;ilenced both hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mo|de&s;ty and diffidence, he would, no doubt, have declined the appointment. This maxim was, that it was the duty of a good
<PB N="7" REF="037716_0007_100EF2665A051648">
man to be always ready, to exert all his powers, and to ri&s;k his life and fortune in his country's cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Diffidence is the attribute of a great mind. Men of little &s;ouls and feeble under&s;tandings, who are ea&s;ily elated by honor or intoxicated by di&s;tinction, will readily undertake any thing, but accompli&s;h nothing. Whereas tho&s;e, who have minds ca|pacious enough to &s;ee and duly appreciate the difficulties of great undertakings, and who are urged on by no &s;ini&s;ter mo|tives, will &s;eldom fail to feel &s;ome reluctance in accepting im|portant offices. From this embarra&s;&s;ment Mo&s;es was relieved by the voice of God. And had not Wa&s;hington, from having viewed the cau&s;e in which he was about to embark in every a&s;pect, and feeling an entire conviction of its ju&s;tice, and the purity of his own motives, been per&s;uaded that the Lord would be upon his &s;ide, his &s;oul would have recoiled at the pro&s;pect before him. But indeed, this was a principle which, in every arduous undertaking, uniformly &s;upported this pious man.</P>
<P>Mo&s;es was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the execution of his commi&s;&s;ion, by the vi&s;ible hand of God. If it &s;hould be contended, that no miracles were wrought in favor of Wa&s;hington&mdash;that his foes were neither infe&s;ted with plagues, nor overwhelmed by the &s;ea, it will hard|ly be denied, that this &s;ingular per&s;onage was rai&s;ed up by the Supreme Being to accompli&s;h &s;uch a mighty work, as was far beyond the powers of common men. For let us only follow him through his military career, after he took the command of the American army at Cambridge. To di&s;cipline this body of men, unaccu&s;tomed to the &s;trictne&s;s and order of a military life, and with a high &s;en&s;e of their own importance: collected al&s;o from all parts of an exten&s;ive continent, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing tempers almo&s;t as various as the climates from which they came, was nearly as difficult as 'to link the jarring elements in peace.' And all this too, was to be done in the face of a powerful foe.</P>
<P>The brave and undaunted &s;oldier, whom no enemy can ap|pal, nor danger &s;ubdue&mdash;the great general who can arrange his army with &s;kill, and lead it on with gallantry in the field of battle, are characters, though ju&s;tly held in much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;timation, far inferior to that of Wa&s;hington. It is not at Trenton, where after contending with the elements, that &s;eemed to be at war&mdash;where after &s;ubduing the Delaware, rolling on, terrible with ice, he led on, through fro&s;t and &s;now, his half-naked ar|my, and &s;urpri&s;ed and vanqui&s;hed the enemy.&mdash;It is not on the
<PB N="8" REF="037716_0008_100EF2695F963268">
plains of Monmouth, where he &s;everely checked and compelled to retire under the cover of night, a powerful foe&mdash;Nor is it in Virginia, where his &s;kill &amp; valour forced to capitulate, a general high in reputation, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the head of a brave army, that we &s;ee our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ero moving in his mo&s;t exalted &s;phere. Had not his wi&s;dom been commen&s;urate with his valour, he might, in a few months, have ruined the American <HI>cau&s;e.</HI> Had he been only c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lculated for brilliant exploits in the field, he would have been an unfit per&s;on for the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him. But when we behold him with an army, mo&s;t even of the officers of which were unacquainted with the art of war&mdash;when we find this army &s;ometimes almo&s;t without ammunition, and often in|deed reduced to little more than a name&mdash;when we con&s;ider, that it was many times upon the point of mutining for want of pay, and fit to peri&s;h for want of cloaths&mdash;and when we re|flect that this army kept in check a formidable foe, protected an exten&s;ive country, in a great mea&s;ure, from rapine, and fi|nally &s;urmounted every ob&s;tacle, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible for us duly to appreciate the merits of its leader.</P>
<P>The war in America was of a &s;ingular nature. The Ameri|cans had not only to contend with a nation far famed for war|like atchievements, but under the threats of puni&s;hment for re|bellion, and almo&s;t at the point of the bayonet, they had to form a &s;y&s;tem of government, and to reduce all things to order and method. To pre&s;cribe regulations for an army was a no|vel ta&s;k to tho&s;e on whom it devolved, and had they not wi&s;ely li&s;tened to the mode&s;t &s;ugge&s;tions, and adopted the judicious plans of Wa&s;hington, all might &s;oon have been lo&s;t. His great &s;oul was unweariedly employed in this arduous bu&s;ine&s;s. As difficulties increa&s;ed, it expanded, and for &s;even long years, which would have exhau&s;ted the per&s;everance, and worn out the re&s;olution of any but this wonderful man, his mind was ince&s;&s;antly engaged. Like a torrent, which when interrupted in its cour&s;e, &s;wells above its banks and at la&s;t overcomes every ob&s;tacle; &s;o his powers increa&s;ed, as difficulties thickened or dangers pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Let us now view the clo&s;e of this varied and tumultuous &s;cene. The enemy &s;ubdued, and peace about to return to a land worn out with the horrors of war, Wa&s;hington &s;tood at the head of an army, that had expo&s;ed their lives, hazarded their he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lth, and injured their fortunes, in their country's cau&s;e. And this army
<PB N="9" REF="037716_0009_100EF26B5A505400">
was unrewarded, and would have followed on, whither&s;oever he might have wi&s;hed to lead them. Had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an a&s;|piring and ambitious &s;pirit, he might have &s;eized the reins of power, enriched his &s;oldiers with the &s;poils of his country, and him&s;elf become its Ruler or its Tyrant. But more like an angel of peace, he &s;oothed their di&s;contents&mdash;he appea&s;ed their anger. When he took leave of his officers, the &s;cene was intere&s;ting indeed! Tho&s;e hardy veterans, whom no ene|my could move, or danger overcome, were melted into tears, when about to part with their beloved Wa&s;hington. And when he re&s;igned that commi&s;&s;ion, under which he had rai&s;ed his country to independence and to glory, he was more than illu&s;trious. This was a point to which the eyes of the whole world were directed with anxiety, and which will command admiration while the world &s;hall remain. Nay, methinks I &s;ee the &s;pirits of the heroes of antiquity hovering around to behold and to wonder at this &s;cene!!</P>
<P>When we view the conduct of many great and popular Ge|nerals, who have &s;ubdued countries, and overturned govern|ments&mdash;when we ca&s;t our eyes over the horrid &s;cenes of revo|lutions in other lands&mdash;when we behold demagogues wading thro' blood and &s;laughter to &s;eize upon power, we cannot be thankful enough to the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er of nations, for having rai&s;ed up a Wa&s;hington in this favored country.</P>
<P>And now he returns to the care&s;&s;es of his family, and to the tranquility of private life. But dear as this was to his &s;oul, it was not long his portion. His country had more &s;ervices, that required the able hand of Wa&s;hington. Here I might &s;till mark the &s;imilarity between the Law-giver of I&s;rael and of America. Mo&s;es had not long re&s;cued the I&s;raelites from Egyptian bondage, until he was called up by God into Mount Sinai, to receive a &s;y&s;tem of laws, both civil and re|ligious. It is true, when Wa&s;hington was called from his peaceful abode, no mountain &s;moked&mdash;no thunder roared&mdash;no voice was heard from heaven. But as civil government is the ordinance of God, tho&s;e, who are in&s;trumental in fixing the form and admini&s;tering the offices of government, are to be con&s;idered, in a high degree, as his agents. A con&s;tituti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n formed amid&s;t the di&s;traction of war, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s found, upon tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, to be inadequate to &s;ecure the rights and promote the welfare
<PB N="10" REF="037716_0010_100EF26F276D1038">
of this va&s;t and growing empire. And when a new form of government was propo&s;ed, and finally adopted, the wi&s;hes of all hearts were fixed upon Wa&s;hington, for the admini&s;tration of this government. Faction, furious and intolerant as it of|ten is, was afraid to &s;hew its hideous face, where once his name was mentioned.</P>
<P>He now appears in a new character. His fame, as a gene|ral, had re&s;ounded from one end of the world to the other; his integrity &s;tood far above &s;u&s;picion; but it remained yet to be tried, how he would appear as a &s;tate&s;man. He began his cour&s;e, under many di&s;advantages. There was no beaten track to direct: there were no fixed principles to govern: all things, and indeed all characters were new. Heaven, how|ever, always &s;miles upon the virtuous efforts of pious men. He put this grand machine in motion&mdash;he conducted it with a ma&s;terly hand. His policy was founded in ju&s;tice, his plans were formed by wi&s;dom, and executed with vigor. Having no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, but the pro&s;perity and glory of his country, he was never p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rplexed by contending pa&s;&s;ions or cla&s;hing intere&s;ts. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a clear judgment, and an exten&s;ive knowledge of the intere&s;ts, pa&s;&s;ions, and relations of his country; having been long habituated to view things in every a&s;pect, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the re&s;ult of every mea&s;ure, his admini&s;tration &s;oon be|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the wonder of other nations, and the glory of his own. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> exten&s;ive empire ro&s;e, under his paternal care, to repu|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ion and to wealth.

<P>While thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thus pro&s;pered in America, tho&s;e diabolical principles, which had been &s;ecretly in operation, in &s;everal parts of Europe, ever &s;ince the time of Voltaire, began to bur&s;t into open action, and the whole European world had li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to have been involved in one univer&s;al flame. It &s;oon became an object with the ho&s;tile powers, to endeavour to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;&s;i&s;tance from America. And &s;uch was their confidence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> their diplomatic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that they little doubted of &s;ucce&s;s. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t this port<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ous cri&s;is, Wa&s;hington, as if rai&s;ed upon an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">inence, viewed with exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, the &s;ituation, the intere&s;t, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and the duty of his country, and finding
<PB N="11" REF="037716_0011_100EF26D2FDBB198">
that no obligation forbid, he placed it in the plea&s;ing, and advantageous po&s;ition of neutrality.</P>
<P>This &s;tep having been deliberately taken, the intrigues of faction, foreign or dome&s;tic, could neither &s;urprize him at his po&s;t, nor force him from his ground. Storms aro&s;e upon every &s;ide&mdash;tempe&s;ts beat&mdash;and thunder roared, yet he re|mained unmoved as a rock amid&s;t the conflicting elements. Too wi&s;e, to relinqui&s;h precipitately the advantages of peace, yet too brave, to dread the horrors of war, he calmly demanded redre&s;s for the injuries done to his country; and this redre&s;s the Briti&s;h nation was plea&s;ed to give. War between America and that nation, was what the French had long been laboring to produce. And finding them&s;elves defeated, they attacked the character of Wa&s;hington&mdash;they in&s;ulted our government&mdash; they plundered our commerce&mdash;they abu&s;ed our citizens&mdash;they di&s;&s;eminated their di&s;organizing and wide-wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting principles, from north to &s;outh, from the &s;hores of the Atlantic to the banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. They vainly hoped to rai&s;e a faction powerful enough, to cru&s;h Wa&s;hington, and with him the vir|tue, and the &s;trength of America. Amid&s;t all this, he &s;teered a correct and an even cour&s;e, faithful to the principles of an impartial neutrality. The unexampled pro&s;perity, that at|tended his mea&s;ures, it might have been &s;uppo&s;ed, would have &s;ilenced oppo&s;ition, and &s;hamed faction out of countenance. But as well might the Ethiopian expect to change his &s;kin, or the leopard his &s;pots.</P>
<P>Having thus guided the helm of &s;tate, thro' many danger|ous rocks and tremendous &s;torms, and pointed the cour&s;e, that it ought to be &s;teered; old age advancing apace, he thought him&s;elf at la&s;t ju&s;tifiable in retiring to the much de&s;ired quie|tude of private life. Still like the great Patriarch, he calls the whole family of America around him, to receive his parting advice. He points out to them tho&s;e evils, that would mo&s;t endanger their welfare, and tells them, that to be happy, they mu&s;t be united, virtuous and pious&mdash;And thus he ends his political career.</P>
<P>After viewing his character as a general and &s;tate&s;man, we will now turn to his religion. This I con&s;ider as a very im|portant part of the duty of this day, particularly at &s;o per|plexed a time as the pre&s;ent. New principles, and new modes of conduct &s;eem, every day, to be intruded upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,

and indeed the religious, as well as the political world &s;eems to be agitated from one end to the other. In &s;uch a &s;tate of things, for America to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a <HI>Chief Magi&s;trate</HI> who adhered to the faith and the practice of chri&s;tianity, is no le&s;s a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter of triumph, than his lo&s;s is a &s;ubject of regret. In|fidelity &s;eems to have made as bold attempts upon us, as ever the idolatry of the &s;urrounding nations did upon the Jews. And, it is much to be feared, that if we had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no Wa&s;hington and other eminent characters, to ward off its at|tacks, it would have found too ea&s;y admi&s;&s;ion. Mo&s;es was only forty days ab&s;ent from the I&s;raelites, when they made a golden calf. And had Wa&s;hington been withdrawn from us at one peculiar cri&s;is, this hou&s;e might have perhaps been a Temple of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> in&s;tead of a Chri&s;tian Church.</P>
<P>It was his religion, that gave the fini&s;hing &s;troke to his cha|racter. The blu&s;tering warrior&mdash;the impious &s;tate&s;man, will never find a place in the roll of fame, at the head of which, will &s;tand the name of Wa&s;hington. Such was his piety, that, on all occa&s;ions, he con&s;idered him&s;elf as an humble in&s;trument in the hands of God, to accompli&s;h the purpo&s;es of his provi|dence. There are many here who have read, and &s;ome perhaps who heard the reflections, which he made, upon the wonderful combination of circum&s;tances, apparently trivial, which &s;aved the American army from de&s;truction, by the treachery of Ar|nold.

addre&s;s, the te&s;timony which he bore to the influence of reli|gion, upon both private and public happine&s;s, ought never to be forgotten. We ought to 'teach i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to our children&mdash;we ought to talk of it when we &s;it in our hou&s;es&mdash;when we walk by the way&mdash;when we lie down, and when we ri&s;e up.' Shall we ever again hear in the land where Wa&s;hington lived, that religion is only calculated for men of weak and puny under|&s;tandings?&mdash;That to attend public wor&s;hip is idle and unne|ce&s;&s;ary, or that in&s;titutions for religious in&s;truction are not among the &s;tronge&s;t pillars of human &s;ociety! Men of narrow capacities or corrupted hearts, may not &s;ee the influence of the&s;e upon public and private felicity, but Wa&s;hington <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of opinion, that it would require a volume to trace all their con|nections. In private life he was no le&s;s amiable, than he was illu&s;trious in public. On both, his principles operated with uniformity&mdash;And when he came to die he had nothing to fear. His life, like a river after pa&s;&s;ing over many a tremendous pre|cipice, and through many a winding vale, i&s;&s;ued, calm and &s;mooth, into the ocean of eternity. 'Mark, then, the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.'</P>
<P>Thus lived, and thus died this great man. His country has much rea&s;on to be grateful to Heaven for his &s;ervices, and much rea&s;on to mourn his lo&s;s. His military fame &s;tood like a ram|part around it, impregnable to foreign force. His well-tried patrioti&s;m kept foreign incendiaries at a di&s;tance, and defeated the machinations of internal faction.&mdash; The &s;plendor of his virtue eclip&s;ed the feeble lights of the illuminati&mdash;they di&s;appeared before it, like the &s;tars at the approach of the &s;un.

<P>But the influence of the good is not confined to the &s;hort period of human life. As he has erected a <HI>Fabric of Liberty,</HI> which nothing but the vices or the folly of his &s;uc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;ors can de&s;troy, &s;o he has left an example, which, like a lamp &s;u&s;pend|ed under the arch of Heaven, will afford light to America, for many ages.

of her darling child, &s;hall prefer her daily ori&s;ons to Heaven; the will pray to grant him a portion of the &s;ame &s;pirit that Wa&s;hington po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. When the father &s;hall apply his care to form the character of his &s;on, he will place before him the life of Wa&s;hington. When Ame|rica &s;hall want a per&s;on to command her armies or direct her councils, &s;he will look for one, who comes as near as may be, to the character of Wa&s;hington. Indeed, it would be exceed|ingly wi&s;e, on all occa&s;ions, when we elect per&s;ons for any of the important offices of government, to inquire how far they re&s;emble this luminous example. We ought not to conceive our&s;elves, for a moment in &s;afety, if we allow vice to rai&s;e its horrible countenance; or permit our&s;elves to be under the di|rection of a&s;piring, wicked, or impious men. Should we di&s;|regard the ble&s;&s;ings which God has been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow up|on us&mdash;&s;hould we &s;port with our deare&s;t rights&mdash;and permit &s;ome &s;acriligious hand to lay hold of the helm of &s;tate&mdash;&s;hould we &s;uffer his benign and holy religion to be trampled under foot; and modern infidelity to &s;eize upon its temples, 'angry Heaven will &s;oon mark us out for ruin, and war overwhelm us in the dream of vice&mdash;vice!&mdash;it is vice that &s;hakes the nerves of every &s;tate, freezes its veins, and withers all its powers.'</P>
<P>Let us cultivate with care, and diligently in&s;til into the minds of our children, the amiable virtues of the chri&s;tian re|ligion, which extend their friendly influence through every branch of public and private life. If the faith of this religion govern the hearts, and its precepts regulate the lives of tho&s;e, with whom we tru&s;t our national concerns, unanimity will &s;oon pervade our councils&mdash;whole&s;ome laws will infu&s;e health and vigor through the whole body politic&mdash;the rancor of party-&s;pirit will &s;ub&s;ide&mdash;contentions for power, honor or intere&s;t will di&s;appear&mdash;every conflicting pa&s;&s;ion will be at peace.
