<BIBL>PSALM CXII. 6.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL BE IN EVER|LASTING REMEMBRANCE.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO be remembered with affection, and de&s;cend to po&s;terity with applau&s;e, is a pecu|liar honor allotted to the righteous. Tho&s;e who have been actuated only by &s;elfi&s;h and ba&s;e pa&s;&s;ions; who have never &s;ought, and never promoted, the happine&s;s of mankind, die without regret, and are &s;oon forgotten. But tho&s;e, of benevolent hearts, who make it their con&s;tant aim to do good to their fellow-men, and in their general conduct are gov|erned by the rules of virtue, acquire a name better than precious ointment. While they live, they are the objects of univer&s;al veneration and love; and when they die, their memory is ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>WHEN, therefore, &s;uch u&s;eful and worthy citi|zens are cut down by the &s;troke of death, &s;urviv|ors, who have been ble&s;&s;ed with their labors of love, mu&s;t be &s;hamefully in&s;en&s;ible not to be deeply af|fected by the lo&s;s. A good man, even in the hum|ble&s;t walks of life, will be followed to the grave by
<PB N="6" REF="038564_0005_10126C66D8BACF80">
his friends, with weeping eyes and &s;orrowful hearts. But when tho&s;e are laid in the du&s;t, who have filled various public &s;tations, with great dig|nity and u&s;efulne&s;s, millions mourn: all are af|flicted: the inhabitants of the whole earth &s;u&s;tain a lo&s;s, and te&s;tify their grief. For &s;uch men are ble&s;&s;ings not to one nation only, but to all. The benign influence of their benevolence, wi&s;dom, and virtue extend to all people. They are, in &s;ome re&s;pects, <HI>that</HI> to the whole human race, which the &s;un is to the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem. They pre&s;erve order and regularity, and diffu&s;e light and comfort to all around them, except tho&s;e, who love darkne&s;s rath|er than light, le&s;t their deeds &s;hould reprove them.</P>
<P>To the&s;e general ob&s;ervations we have been led, by the univer&s;al &s;adne&s;s and mourning, which have been &s;preading through the earth, ever &s;ince the fatal fourteenth of December la&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. WASHINGTON died Dec. 14th, 1799, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the evening, after a &s;hort illne&s;s of about twenty-four hours. His di&s;or|der was an inflammatory fore throat, which proceeded from a cold.</NOTE> On that ever-memorable day, our beloved WASHINGTON re&s;ted from his labors. He fini&s;hed his career of terre&s;|trial glory, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as we tru&s;t, of that eternal weight of glory, which GOD of his grace has prepared for the faithful.</P>
<P>BUT, although his body is mouldering in the du&s;t, the memory of him &s;hall never peri&s;h. He &s;till lives, and he will always live, in the affections of his grateful countrymen. His unexampled achievements will &s;tand recorded upon the faith|ful
<PB N="7" REF="038564_0006_10126C686DB53F88">
page of hi&s;tory, till time &s;hall end; and he will be handed down to po&s;terity, as one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of men. Yea, more, as we be|lieve, his name is written in the LAMB'S book of life, which is beyond the reach of devouring time, and he will literally be in everla&s;ting remembrance.</P>
<P>Is then our beloved WASHINGTON removed from us for ever? Will he no more lead our armies to victory; aid us by his &s;age advice; or ble&s;s us with his future coun&s;els? We are unwilling to believe either. But, alas! the&s;e painful truths are not to be denied. He who triumphed over the enemies of America, who &s;ubdued the enmity of all hearts, has him&s;elf fallen a victim to the la&s;t enemy, Death. By his demi&s;e, the &s;en&s;ibility of every American is &s;orely wounded. The &s;adne&s;s of every countenance is expre&s;&s;ive of the grief of every heart.</P>
<P>AT &s;uch a time of univer&s;al &s;orrow, it is with great propriety, that our civil rulers have invited us to the hou&s;e of GOD. Here we may unitedly contemplate our <HI>afflictions</HI> and our <HI>con&s;olations.</HI> By &s;uitably con&s;idering both the&s;e; by reflecting up|on the wonderful di&s;pen&s;ations of Divine Provi|dence; and by our humiliations and fervent pray|ers to GOD, we may hope, that our hearts will be properly affected:&mdash;that &s;uch a balance of our pa&s;|&s;ions will be produced, that we &s;hall not be ex|travagantly depre&s;&s;ed or elated "at aught this &s;cene can threaten or indulge." May the whole nation be deeply humbled under the mighty hand
<PB N="8" REF="038564_0007_10126C6B819282F8">
of GOD. May our united humiliations and &s;up|plications come up before GOD, as &s;weet incen&s;e. With devout hearts, may we adopt the prayer of the P&s;almi&s;t: "Help, LORD, for the godly man cea&s;eth; for the faithful fail from among the chil|dren of men."</P>
<P>IN AMERICA, the 22d of February has been cel|ebrated, with fe&s;tivity and rejoicing, becau&s;e, in the year 1732, it gave birth to WASHINGTON. But, alas! how are the accu&s;tomed &s;cenes of this day rever&s;ed! Our fe&s;tivity cea&s;es. Our &s;ongs of joy are changed for tears of grief. We are clad in mourning attire.</P>
<LG>
<L>" To civic triumphs, funeral rites &s;ucceed;</L>
<L>To flowery garlands, this encircling weed;</L>
<L>And to loud paeans &s;ounding through the &s;kies,</L>
<L>Low &s;olemn dirges and heart rending &s;ighs."</L>
</LG>
<P>INDEED, if the citizens of America were not deeply affected with the lo&s;s of their political FA|THER, they would evince ba&s;e ingratitude, and even &s;toical apathy. To drop a tear over his tomb, is as agreeable to our holy religion, as it is congenial with our afflicted hearts. In this our heavenly FATHER, who knows the weakne&s;s of our frame and the greatne&s;s of our lo&s;s, will read|ily indulge us. In doing this, we &s;hall copy his example, whom to imitate is our greate&s;t glory. For we are told that our Divine MASTER wept at the grave of his friend Lazarus.</P>
<P>BUT, my friends, for whom do we weep? Is it for our Father, or for our&s;elves and our country?
<PB N="9" REF="038564_0008_10126C6FA4DB39F8">
Surely not for him. For, if, as Chri&s;t has told us, we may know men by their fruits, we mu&s;t believe, that he has made a happy change.</P>
<P>LOOK, then, on the various parts of Gen. WASHINGTON'S life, and you will find that he uni|formly maintained an excellent character. He was eminent for tho&s;e virtues, which adorn human na|ture, and endear a man to &s;ociety. Through his whole life, he &s;eems to have been actuated by a generous, humane, and patriotic &s;pirit, and to have di&s;charged his public and private duties with &s;in|gular fidelity. Notwith&s;tanding he had filled the mo&s;t exalted &s;tations in &s;ociety, and was loaded with all the honors, which his grateful country could be&s;tow, yet he uniformly exhibited a &s;hining pattern of humility and dignified conde&s;cen&s;ion. He was a PUBLIC PROFESSOR<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General WASHINGTON was educated an Epi&s;copalian, and u&s;ually at|tended divine &s;ervice in that church; but he exerci&s;ed great liberality of &s;en|timent towards all other denominations of Chri&s;tians. Says he in his farewel addre&s;s to the people; "With <HI>&s;light &s;hades</HI> of difference, you have the <HI>&s;ame religion."</HI></NOTE> of the Chri&s;tian relig|ion, and in his life and conver&s;ation adorned its doc|trines. His ob&s;ervance of the Sabbath was very exemplary,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">At his entrance upon his civil employments, Gen. WASHINGTON an|nounced to the public that he would attend to no &s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s upon the Lord's day, and he uniformly adhered to his re&s;olution.</NOTE> and in his attendance upon the public wor&s;hip of GOD, which was regular and con&s;tant, he always appeared &s;erious and engaged. Nor did he think this the only homage he was bound to pay his Maker. He maintained a daily intercour&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="038564_0009_10126C713A136E80">
with Heaven by prayer.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By one of the General's dome&s;tics while at Cambridge, we are inform|ed, that he regularly maintained family prayer. Through the whole of the war, he is known to have ob&s;erved &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons of retirement for &s;ecret de|votion. And it was his po&s;itive order for none to intrude upon him, but in ca&s;e of an alarm.</NOTE> Frequently in his con|ver&s;ation and in his communications to the public, he expre&s;&s;ed his deep &s;en&s;e of a &s;uperintending Providence, and of his own dependence upon the divine care and direction. He never &s;aid, like the proud conquerors of the earth, My own arm hath gotten me the victory. But he uniformly a&s;cribed his &s;ucce&s;s to the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD upon the united exertions of the whole nation. Read his "Polit|ical Legacies," and you will need nothing further to convince you of his high &s;en&s;e of the import|ance of religion.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A &s;triking &s;pecimen of this, you may &s;ee in the following extract from his "Circular Letter to the Governors of the &s;everal States, in 1783." "I now make it my earne&s;t prayer, that God would have you, and the State over which you pre&s;ide, in his holy protection; that he would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a &s;pirit of &s;ubordination and obedience to govern|ment; to entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another, for their fellow-citizens of the United States at large; and particularly, for their breth|ren who have &s;erved in the field; and finally, that he would mo&s;t graciou&s;ly be plea&s;ed to di&s;po&s;e us all to do ju&s;tice, to love mercy, and to demean our|&s;elves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of mind, which were the characteri&s;tics of the DIVINE AUTHOR of our BLESSED RELICION&punc; with|out an humble imitation of who&s;e example, in the&s;e things, we can never hope to be a happy nation."</NOTE> In the clo&s;ing &s;cene of life, he di&s;covered nothing of the weakne&s;s of human na|ture;&mdash;no di&s;tru&s;t of the foundation of his hope. He declared, that he was not afraid to die. And he met his fate, as he had lived, like a CHRISTIAN HERO. Although exerci&s;ed with acute pain, not a murmur or a groan e&s;caped from him. With
<PB N="11" REF="038564_0010_10126C747A3E9178">
great compo&s;ure, he clo&s;ed his eyes, with his own hand, and re&s;igned his &s;pirit to GOD who gave it. "Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xxxvii. 37.</NOTE></P>
<P>CAN we de&s;ire better evidence re&s;pecting our departed friend, on which to found a judgment of charity? Is not &s;uch profe&s;&s;ion and &s;uch a practice the be&s;t proof we can have, that he was one of tho&s;e righteous per&s;ons, who &s;hall be in everla&s;ting remembrance? A celebrated poet hath ju&s;tly &s;aid,</P>
<L>"For modes of faith let gracele&s;s zealots fight,</L>
<L>His can't be wrong, who&s;e life is in the right."</L>
<P>WE may, therefore, mingle tears of joy with tears of grief, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. While we mourn our lo&s;s, we &s;hould rejoice at his gain. And truly it is no &s;mall con&s;olation to have &s;uch &s;ub&s;tantial evidence, that our decea&s;ed friend is gone to the FATHER, to be forever happy with the LORD.</P>
<P>BY the death of General WASHINGTON the <HI>world</HI> &s;u&s;tains a lo&s;s. His writings, his character, and example had a mo&s;t exten&s;ive and &s;alutary in|fluence. The <HI>friends of order</HI> have lo&s;t in him one of the main pillars by which regular governments of every denomination are upheld. For he firmly oppo&s;ed the re&s;tle&s;s di&s;organizers of civil &s;ociety, and tho&s;e haughty de&s;pots, who would give laws to all the world. He was willing that every na|tion &s;hould choo&s;e its own form of government
<PB N="12" REF="038564_0011_10126C77B2DE5E90">
and be ruled by its own laws. That right he readily yielded to others, which, at every ri&s;k, he had claimed and defended for his own nation. By his death the <HI>friends of &s;ocial happine&s;s</HI> have lo&s;t, I will not &s;ay, the founder of freedom, but the CHIEF CORNER-STONE, on which rational liberty has been erected. Mourn, ye Inhabitants of the earth! Weep, ye Sons of Freedom! For you have lo&s;t one of your be&s;t friends and greate&s;t benefactors.</P>
<P>BUT, alas! Who can calculate the lo&s;s of this GREAT MAN to <HI>America?</HI> We are deprived of our fir&s;t man: Fir&s;t in <HI>war;</HI> fir&s;t in <HI>peace;</HI> fir&s;t in the affections of his countrymen. And ju&s;tly was he dear to them. For, through a long cour&s;e of years, he rendered the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices to his country.</P>
<P>IN early life, he gave &s;triking proofs of his tal|ents, and commenced his career of u&s;efulne&s;s. Be|fore he was twenty years of age, he was appointed to a military command. In the year 1753, when the French and Indians from Canada, made en|croachments on the frontiers of Virginia, he was commi&s;&s;ioned, on the difficult and dangerous enter|pri&s;e of treating with the Indians, and of warning the French, to de&s;i&s;t from their aggre&s;&s;ions. This commi&s;&s;ion he executed with honor to him&s;elf and &s;atisfaction to his con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>IN 1755, he &s;u&s;tained the rank of extra Aid de Camp to General Braddock, and gave a &s;triking &s;pecimen of his military &s;kill. That ill-fated com|mander, contemptuou&s;ly rejecting the prudent ad|vice
<PB N="13" REF="038564_0012_10126C7AB10E0778">
of WASHINGTON, fell into an ambu&s;h of the Savages, on the banks of the Monongahela, near the Ohio, by which him&s;elf with a large part of the army were &s;lain. Colonel WASHINGTON, by his pre&s;ence of mind and gallant behavior, &s;av|ed the remainder from the rage of the victorious foe. This he did in &s;uch a ma&s;terly manner, as gained him the applau&s;e both of Great Britain and America. This brilliant action in a young officer, was the occa&s;ion of his being <HI>then</HI> &s;poken of in terms which <HI>now</HI> &s;eem in a manner prophetic of his future greatne&s;s. Pre&s;ident DAVIES, in a &s;er|mon publi&s;hed at that time, calls him a worthy young man, whom Providence &s;eems rai&s;ing up to be the SAVIOR of his country.</P>
<P>IN the year 1759, on account of bodily indi&s;po|&s;ition, he re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion in the Briti&s;h army. His health being gradually re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, he married the pre&s;ent amiable Mrs. WASHING|TON, and &s;ettled as planter and farmer on his e&s;|tate at Mount Vernon. From 1759 to 1774, he was a member of A&s;&s;embly, a magi&s;trate of the county in which he re&s;ided, and a judge of the court. In each of the&s;e capacities, he acted with the &s;ame a&s;&s;iduity and fidelity, as in his more ex|alted offices. He was elected a delegate to the fir&s;t Congre&s;s in 1774, and to that which a&s;&s;ociated in the following year.</P>
<P>How wonderful are the ways of God! By a &s;pecial Providence does WASHINGTON &s;eem to be rai&s;ed up and endowed with extraordinary talents
<PB N="14" REF="038564_0013_10126C7F3659AE58">
particularly &s;uited to the eventful era of his life. And this appears to be the time, de&s;tined by Heav|en, for calling them con&s;picuou&s;ly into exerci&s;e. Great Britain claimed, and by force of arms was attempting to exerci&s;e, "the right of making laws binding us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever." This rou&s;ed the martial genius of the country, and, on the 19th of April, 1775, the flames of war bur&s;t forth in America. When, therefore, a General was nece&s;|&s;ary to conduct our armies, the eyes of Congre&s;s were immediately turned upon WASHINGTON. He was then in the vigor of manhood, and well acquainted with the &s;cience of war. He &s;u&s;tained a high reputation, as a &s;oldier, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t engaging addre&s;s. And by the unanimous voice of Congre&s;s, to the univer&s;al &s;atisfaction of the people, he was appointed to that mo&s;t import|ant office. This tru&s;t he accepted with a mod|e&s;ty and diffidence peculiar to him&s;elf. The united voice of the people, he con&s;idered, as the voice of GOD. He therefore dared not to di&s;obey. So ardent was his love of liberty; he looked down on &s;lavery with &s;uch noble indignity; and he felt &s;uch re&s;entment at the injuries done his country, that he was not awed by the terrors of a <HI>pro&s;cription.</HI> Without any pecu|niary reward, he determined to enter on the per|ilous enterpri&s;e, having no alternative before him, but victory or death. But &s;atisfied of the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, he tru&s;ted GOD for the event.</P>
<P>DURING an eight-years war, he encountered in|numerable difficulties, fatigues, and dangers. He
<PB N="15" REF="038564_0014_10126C82450971A8">
conducted the whole with &s;ingular wi&s;dom. At all times, his great military &s;kill was con&s;picuous; but he &s;hone with the brighte&s;t lu&s;tre in the dark|e&s;t and mo&s;t perplexing &s;ea&s;ons. Difficulties and dangers were &s;o far from di&s;heartening him, that they gave a &s;pring to his &s;pirits;&mdash;an energy to his exertions, that removed every ob&s;truction. An in&s;tance of this, you may recollect, took place in the clo&s;e of the year 1776: that mo&s;t gloomy period of our affairs,&mdash;that cri&s;is of American dan|ger. GENERAL WASHINGTON with a handful of men, naked and de&s;titute of almo&s;t every conve|nience, was then flying through the Jer&s;ies, before a numerous, veteran, and well-&s;upplied army. How did his great &s;oul, at this trying time, &s;hine out in all its &s;plendor. Combating the mo&s;t for|midable difficulties, braving the rigors of winter, and the inclemencies of the weather, he with his little band performed prodigies of valor at Tren|ton and Princeton. They checked the force of the whole Briti&s;h army, and clo&s;ed with honor a di&s;|a&s;trous campaign. How &s;ucce&s;sfully he afterwards oppo&s;ed our enemies, you need not be told. The battles he fought, the victories he won, and the armies he captivated, are fre&s;h in your memories. His prudence, his caution, his wi&s;dom, and forti|tude; his incorruptible fidelity and invincible per|&s;everance; his policy in cluding and circumvent|ing the foe; his amazing fertility of invention, in finding out expedients to guard again&s;t future dif|ficulties; his great &s;agacity in penetrating the de|&s;igns of the enemy and judging of their future
<PB N="16" REF="038564_0015_10126C83DD00F8F8">
movements; and his ma&s;terly addre&s;s in compo|&s;ing differences, in &s;ilencing the voice of di&s;content and mutiny, and harmonizing the di&s;cordant parts of his army, are &s;o well known as to fill us with admiration, and will be told to the a&s;toni&s;hment of future generations. A particular detail of his achievements in the Revolutionary War, will not be expected on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that he obtained the grand object for which he contended. He with the PATRIOT ARMY drove the enemy from our &s;hores, and &s;et|tled our country in peace, liberty and independence.</P>
<P>THIS arduous conflict being ended, our victori|ous General, on the 23d of December, 1783, re&s;ign|ed his commi&s;&s;ion to Congre&s;s, and, like Cincinna|tus of Rome, retired to the rank of a private citi|zen, amid the mo&s;t flattering plaudits of his coun|trymen.</P>
<P>BUT great talents, de&s;igned for public u&s;e, could not long be &s;olely occupied in private concerns. The exigencies of our country &s;oon called him to the public council. The old Confederation, form|ed in ha&s;te, being found e&s;&s;entially deficient, a new form of Government mu&s;t be in&s;tituted. In the augu&s;t body, delegated from every part of the Union to perform this mighty work, we behold our venerable WASHINGTON, by their unanimous &s;uffrage, placed at their head. Their united wi&s;|dom produced our pre&s;ent happy Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>AFTER the Con&s;titution was adopted by the &s;ev|eral States, a mighty ta&s;k &s;till remained to be per|formed.
<PB N="17" REF="038564_0016_10126C886B692CA8">
The government mu&s;t be organized. This complicated machine mu&s;t be &s;et in motion. A per&s;on was to be cho&s;en, who &s;hould &s;ee that the laws were faithfully executed. Happy for America, there was one citizen, who&s;e pre-eminent endowments and di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ervices, precluded all controver&s;y re&s;pecting the man to whom this important tru&s;t &s;hould be committed. By the free &s;uffrages of the electors in every State, the General of our armies was twice cho&s;en PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. On the 30th of April, 1789, he was introduced to office.</P>
<P>THROUGH eight tempe&s;tuous years, he &s;at at the helm of our political &s;hip. Here again he di&s;play|ed great talents and &s;ublime virtues. Encompa&s;&s;|ed by dangers on either &s;ide;&mdash;having Scylla on the one hand and Charybdis on the other, he &s;kil|fully &s;teered a middle cour&s;e, and avoided them both.</P>
<P>AT length, worn down with cares and fatigues, and thinking, that duty no longer called him to the arduous ta&s;k of the Pre&s;idency, he declined be|ing con&s;idered a candidate for that office.</P>
<P>AGAIN he retires to his beloved &s;hades. But not long does he enjoy his wi&s;hed repo&s;e. The enemies of our country in&s;ult our government and abu&s;e our citizens. Force is found nece&s;&s;ary to maintain our rights. While WASHINGTON lived, no other could be thought of to command our armies. At the reque&s;t of our worthy CHIEF

MAGISTRATE, and to the joy of every American, he accepted the appointment to that important office. The indignities and abu&s;es offered to his country, arou&s;ed the re&s;entment and martial geni|us of us our war-worn General. He again girded on his conquering &s;word. He took the command of our armies, and directed their operations, till HE, who is higher than the highe&s;t, &s;ummoned him from all his earthly employments to join the ar|mies above. "Behold, the Lord, the LORD of ho&s;ts doth take away the mighty man, the man of war, the honorable man and the coun&s;ellor."</P>
<P>DID ever before, &s;o many great and good qual|ities unite in one man! It is difficult to determine whether he excelled mo&s;t in the cabinet, or in the field. He had the &s;ingular felicity of uniting all hearts in favor of the mea&s;ures he recommended for the common good. Such was the purity of his motives, and the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of his con|duct; &s;o long had his fellow-citizens experienced his wi&s;dom, and fidelity to their intere&s;ts, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their entire confidence. This however was not a blind credulity. He recommended his plans of operation with &s;uch force of rea&s;on, and in &s;uch an engaging manner, that all, who were open to conviction, were convinced of their &s;ound pol|icy and &s;timulated to carry them into effect. We may &s;afely challenge civil hi&s;tory to produce his equal. Where &s;hall we find another, who, for &s;o long a period, has filled &s;uch various, important, and very difficult &s;tations, with univer&s;al applau&s;e, and

ended his career with equally well-earned honors? When compared with Alexander, Ce&s;ar, and the mighty conquerors of the ea&s;t, he ri&s;es far above them. They fought for dominion, to increa&s;e the number of their mi&s;erable &s;laves. But WASHING|TON fought for PEACE, for the LIBERTY and INDE|PENDENCE of his country, and to promote the happine&s;s of mankind. They were the plunder|ers and butchers of the human race; he their ben|efactor and friend. They were the en&s;lavers of <HI>their</HI> country, he was the SAVIOR of <HI>his.</HI> Con&s;idered in every point of view, we do not he&s;itate to pro|nounce him one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t men the world ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>BUT, Oh, the frailty of human greatne&s;s! This fir&s;t of men, the pride of America, the admiration of the world, the glory of human nature, mu&s;t die like the re&s;t of mortals! Let us con&s;ole our&s;elves under this lo&s;s, with the con&s;ideration, that he has fini&s;hed his cour&s;e with joy;&mdash;that he has changed Mount Vernon, for Mount Zion. Farewell, illu&s;|trious Shade! Patron of liberty! We pay the&s;e funeral rites, the&s;e la&s;t, but ju&s;t re&s;pects, to thy dear remains. Securely may thy precious du&s;t re&s;t in the &s;ilent tomb, till the trump of GOD &s;hall rou&s;e the dead to judgment. Then may we meet thee again, and with thee be vindicated into the glorious liberties of the &s;ons of GOD.</P>
<P>BUT, my mourning friends, &s;hall we bury all our comforts in one grave? Have we nothing left to &s;olace our grief and wipe away our tears? Ble&s;&s;|ed

be GOD we have many con&s;olations. We think too well of our pre&s;ent Rulers and of our fellow-citizens at large, to indulge the thought that when General WASHINGTON died, wi&s;dom, valor, and patrioti&s;m peri&s;hed with him. He was indeed our fir&s;t man, but not our whole depen|dence. Not a few of the PATRIOT ARMY, who&s;e valor and military &s;kill were equalled by few and exceeded by none, &s;till live, ready to ri&s;e in the defence of their country. Many others, who were &s;ignally in&s;trumental in bringing about our REV|OLUTION, &s;till remain di&s;po&s;ed to contribute their exertions to the common good. And although our worthy CHIEF is removed into darkne&s;s, yet he &s;till lives in his bright example and mo&s;t excel|lent writings. By the&s;e, although dead he yet &s;peaketh, and tells us what we mu&s;t do to &s;ave and build up our ri&s;ing republic. By the&s;e, we doubt not, many of the pre&s;ent and future generations will be made wi&s;er and better, and in&s;pired with patrioti&s;m and valor. E&s;pecially, &s;hould we con|&s;ole our&s;elves with the reflection, that the LORD GOD OMNIPOTENT reigneth. He hath &s;ignally protected us in times pa&s;t, and we have abundant rea&s;on to repo&s;e our tru&s;t in him. Con&s;ider, my friends, what great things GOD has done for us. When, heretofore, worthy public characters have been taken from us by death; have not others been rai&s;ed up to &s;ill their important &s;tations? When a HANCOCK was removed, did not a SUM|NER &s;ucceed? And now WASHINGTON is gone,
<PB N="21" REF="038564_0020_10126C9511C65E88">
does not ADAMS remain? His wi&s;dom, patrioti&s;m, and fidelity, in various public &s;tations, for more than twenty years together, have rai&s;ed his char|acter above the reach of &s;lander, and ju&s;tly endear|ed him to every enlightened American.</P>
<P>WITH &s;uch in&s;tances of God's goodne&s;s before our eyes, to di&s;tru&s;t his future care would be ba&s;e ingratitude. Let us thank GOD and take courage. He that rai&s;ed up a WASHINGTON for us at &s;uch a critical juncture of our affairs, can do any thing for us; and he will do every thing we need, if our ways as a nation plea&s;e him.</P>
<P>LET us, therefore, &s;tudy to improve in that righteou&s;ne&s;s, which exalteth a nation. Let us cultivate love and unanimity, among our&s;elves, remembering that united we &s;tand; divided we fall. Let us encourage the hearts and &s;trengthen the hands of our Rulers. Our united confidence in their integrity and wi&s;dom will afford them the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction, and they will be excited there|by to continue their exertions for the public good. And let us manife&s;t our love for our country, and our re&s;pect for him, who&s;e lo&s;s we this day deplore, by imitating his virtues, and by laying up his coun|&s;els in our hearts. In his admirable LEGACY, we have the fruit of his long experience and mo&s;t ma|ture reflections. It clearly points out to us the way to national &s;afety and happine&s;s. And it richly de&s;erves to be trea&s;ured up in the memory of every American.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="038564_0021_10126C96A99E3878">
ABOVE all, let us cordially embrace and obey the go&s;pel of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. He hath &s;et us a pattern of all holy living, and he hath taught us the words of eternal life. By living agreeably to the maxims of his religion, we &s;hall find joy and con&s;olation; we &s;hall have peace, in our death; we &s;hall be good citizens, in this world; and, finally, we &s;hall be made citizens of the New Jeru|&s;alem, where &s;orrow and mourning &s;hall never enter, and where, with the a&s;&s;embly of ju&s;t men made perfect, we &s;hall dwell forever at God's right hand.</P>
