<HEAD>NARRATIVE OF A VOYAGE FROM PHILADELPHIA TO ST. BARTHOLOMEWS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY WILLIAM WHELAND.</BYLINE>
<P>ON the 27th day of Augu&s;t, 1799, I &s;et &s;ail from the port of Philadelphia, on board the &s;choo|ner Eliza, bound for St. Thomas's: American &s;eamen being at that time very hard to be obtain|ed, I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;hipping three fo|reigners; &s;o that my crew con&s;i&s;ted of two Ameri|cans, Thomas Croft, (whom I afterwards appoin|ted mate,) and Jacob Su&s;ter, together with the three foreigners, who entered with me by the names of Jo&s;eph Baker, Jo&s;eph Brous and Peter Peter|&s;on. The name of our &s;upercargo was Charles Rey, a French gentleman, who had long re&s;ided in the i&s;]and of St. Domingo, and had borne the com|mi&s;&s;ion of general in the armies of his Catholic ma|je&s;ty, previous to the revolution; but, like many others of his unfortunate countrymen, was under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking an a&s;ylum in America,
<PB N="4" REF="039087_0003_1013997A5863F520">
when the Negroes had &s;eized upon the govern|ment of that i&s;land.</P>
<P>In this country he married an amiable young lady, of Baltimore, of French extraction, with whom he lived in the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate of conju|gal felicity, and by whom he had one child. He occa&s;ionally re&s;ided at Philadelphia and Baltimore; in both of which places, he had endeared him&s;elf to a numerous circle of acquaintance, by the cheer|fulne&s;s of his conver&s;ation and the &s;uavity of his manners: his fortunes, however, began, to be con|&s;iderably impaired, by di&s;appointments in his remit|tances from St. Domingo, and other real lo&s;&s;es to a great amount; he re&s;olved, therefore, to go out &s;upercargo, with a view of regaining, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome part of his immen&s;e property in the i&s;land, and to provide for a beloved wife and encrea&s;ing family.</P>
<P>Neither Mr. Rey nor my&s;elf had a good opi|nion of the three foreigners. They &s;eemed to us to be men of an implacable and revengeful &s;pirit; for, &s;oon after we had &s;ailed, in going down the river, one of them, Peter&s;on, alias Louis Lacroix, having refu&s;ed to obey the orders of the mate, I &s;truck him; on &s;eeing this, Baker came to his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, and Mr. Rey &s;tepped forward to protect me; when I had given Baker a good beating, they both promi&s;ed to do their duty like good men, if I would forgive them, which I immediately
<PB N="5" REF="039087_0004_101399BD0BA49F10">
promi&s;ed to do; after which they behaved them|&s;elves for 14 days very well, and there was no more di&s;pute until the 12th of September, being in latitude 28, 30, N. and in longitude 60, 00, W. At about 10 o'clock, P. M. it being the mate's watch on deck, Mr. Rey and my&s;elf had gone to &s;leep in our births, one on each &s;ide of the cabin. It appears that the three de&s;peradoes, Baker, Brous and Peter&s;on, availed them&s;elves of an opportunity, while the mate was a-&s;leep on deck, to give him a blow on the head with an axe: but, as no per|&s;on was on deck at that time, except the mate and the three ruffians, a circum&s;tantial account of the murder of the mate cannot be obtained. Cer|tain it is, however, that he was murdered and thrown over-board. By their account afterwards to me, Brous is &s;aid to have given him the fir&s;t blow, and Baker, alias Boulanger, the &s;econd, which fini&s;hed his exi&s;tence; but, by their con|fe&s;&s;ion in Philadelphia, before judge Peters, it is &s;aid, that the mate and Brous, having &s;ome quar|rel, and Brous declaring him&s;elf the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el, and the mate his pri&s;oner of war, the mate &s;truck him, which cau&s;ed Brous, alias Berouce, in his own defence, to lift up an axe, and give him a blow on the head: This was a bad plea of &s;elf-defence, as the mate was obviou&s;ly ju&s;tified in &s;triking a man who acknowledged his intention of turning pirate, and taking the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="039087_0005_1013997BDD764C20">As &s;oon as Thomas Croft, the mate, was di&s;|patched, and while he lay lifele&s;s on the deck, they entered the cabin, and, approaching the birth where I lay a&s;leep, one of them &s;truck me one blow over the head, and another over the arm, with an axe, and immediately I received a &s;tab in the arm with a &s;word. Upon which, I &s;prung up, and &s;eized my pi&s;tols, which were under my head; at the &s;ame time, Charles Rey, awaking from his &s;leep by the noi&s;e which this circum&s;tance occa&s;ioned, jumped out of his birth, and cried out in French, what is the matter? And &s;eeing that I was a&s;&s;ail|ed by the three villains, by the blood on my face and arm, he &s;natched a pi&s;tol &s;uddenly from my hand, and turning upon them, they retreated from the cabin; but, in his attempt to follow them, he received a &s;evere blow over the head with the pump brake, which laid him on the cabin floor; however, he &s;oon recovered a little, but, as it was dark, neither of us dur&s;t make a &s;econd attempt to go up from the cabin, thro' fear of meeting with a &s;imilar reception. No words can de&s;cribe the hor|rors of my &s;ituation for nearly half an hour: my wounds were extremely painful, and I was almo&s;t covered with blood, while Mr. Rey &s;eemed a little delirious from the blow he had received on his head, and I expected every moment to be over|powered by the ruffians, and finally murdered.
<PB N="7" REF="039087_0006_101399BF97944140">
We were in this &s;ituation, when Mr. Rey, &s;eeing light on deck, &s;prung up in a fit of de&s;peration to make a &s;econd effort, when he received another mortal blow on the head.</P>
<P>Thinking that my generous friend, Mr. Rey, was murdered, and &s;eeing my&s;elf covered with blood, I wrenched the pi&s;tol, with &s;ome difficulty, from his dying-gra&s;p, and putting my&s;elf in a po&s;|ture of defence, I begged they would &s;pare my life. Not knowing, at that moment, that the mate was murdered, I imagined the whole crew had ri&s;en again&s;t me, until tho&s;e murderers informed me, that all, except my&s;elf, were killed,&mdash;bidding me come on deck, which I refu&s;ed, as I was apprehen|&s;ive that if I did, I &s;hould be immediately mur|dered. They then ordered me to hand them up liquor, which I was incapable of doing, on ac|count of the wounds which I had already received; neverthele&s;s, as they &s;aw me armed with pi&s;tols, they were afraid of entering the cabin. A kind of parley then took place betwixt us, in which it was agreed, that I &s;hould navigate the ve&s;&s;el to the Spani&s;h Main, on condition that they would &s;pare my life. Under an a&s;&s;urance of &s;paring their lives, they entered the cabin, &s;upplied them&s;elves with liquor, and removed Mr. Rey upon deck: he was &s;till in life; but it was impo&s;&s;ible, even with me|dical aid, that he could have recovered. He
<PB N="8" REF="039087_0007_1013997E64674A48">
appeared in&s;en&s;ible to every thing that was going forward after his la&s;t fatal wound. The&s;e mon|&s;ters, eager to fini&s;h the diabolical work they had begun, ha&s;tened to throw him over-board, al|though there was evident &s;igns of life. But the&s;e wretches were not yet &s;atiated with blood. Jacob Su&s;ter, the remaining &s;eaman, who had not joined in the con&s;piracy, and who had been a&s;leep in the fore-ca&s;tle during this &s;cene of horror, was now called aft, under a pretence that I wanted him; but, no &s;ooner had he advanced within reach of the&s;e wretches, than he was knocked down with an axe, and immediately thrown into the &s;ea. At that time we had light winds, and the ve&s;&s;el was making very little way, &s;o that I could di&s;tinctly hear his groans for at lea&s;t eight or ten minutes.</P>
<P>Jacob Su&s;ter was not known to me previous to his entering on board the &s;chooner; but, from his &s;hipment to the hour of his death, his beha|viour was that of a good and faithful &s;eaman. He was born in Germantown, in the &s;tate of Penn|&s;ylvania, where his parents, I am informed, now re&s;ide.</P>
<P>When the&s;e villains had fini&s;hed their work of murder, and con&s;cious of their own incapacity to navigate the ve&s;&s;el, they came into the cabin, and dre&s;&s;ed my wounds: they then proceeded to wa&s;h off the blood from the floor of the cabin and from
<PB N="9" REF="039087_0008_101399C128A59FD8">
the deck, which, when they had fini&s;hed, they be|gan, as &s;oon as morning appeared, to pillage the property of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>When day-light appeared, and perceiving that they con&s;idered their own &s;afety to depend upon my knowledge of navigation, I began to have &s;ome hopes that my life would be &s;pared, and even that the ve&s;&s;el might be regained; but, tho' I found my pi&s;tols &s;erviceable to me in keeping them off, I was apprehen&s;ive, that, in ca&s;e of another conflict, they might be u&s;ed again&s;t my&s;elf; I, therefore, threw my pi&s;tols overboard &s;ecretly,&mdash;a circum|&s;tance which they never found out; for they always under&s;tood that I had them in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, in mutual fear of each other, we proceeded as they &s;uppo&s;ed towards the Spa|ni&s;h Main, but in this I deceived them, by telling them that a &s;trong current &s;et in to the we&s;tward, and that we mu&s;t keep a more ea&s;terly cour&s;e, which we did, but without di&s;covering a &s;ail. Dur|ing this time, though the weather was generally moderate, the &s;ails and rigging not being well trim|med, received con&s;iderable damage; for, I was not capable of handling a rope my&s;elf, and they were not under my &s;ubjection or orders; be&s;ides, when my arm, which I had con&s;tantly kept in a &s;ling, be|gan to grow better, I endeavoured to conceal it as much as po&s;&s;ible from them, thinking that my &s;e|curity
<PB N="10" REF="039087_0009_1013997FEB8547F8">
con&s;i&s;ted, in a great mea&s;ure, on their ideas of my weakne&s;s. In the mean while, their principal occupation was in rifling the ve&s;&s;el, breaking open packages, in &s;earch of any thing valuable, or for barrels of hams or other provi&s;ions; whil&s;t I was on the watch for an opportunity to overcome them, and get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>This opportunity pre&s;ented on the 21&s;t Septem|ber, on the ninth day after the murderers had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ve&s;&s;el. Two of them, Peter&s;on, alias La Croix, and Baker, alias Boulanger, went down the fore-&s;cuttle to bring up &s;ome hams, while Brous was &s;tooping down to make a fire in the cabcu&s;h; I immediately &s;eized a club that lay near me, with my left hand, my right being &s;till in a &s;ling, and gave Brous, a &s;evere blow on the back of the head, which laid him flat on the deck; I attempted a &s;econd blow, but mi&s;&s;ed him. Mr. Rey's bull-dog &s;eeing me engaged, flew, bark|ing to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which &s;o much deterred Brous from turning upon me, that he run aft, and got up the &s;hrouds; I immediately &s;natched up an axe, and ran to the fore-&s;cuttle, &s;lipping my arm from the &s;ling, and forgetting my wounds, lifted up the axe, as in act to &s;trike the two that were there, and who&s;e heads were then above the deck, attempting to come out; but the moment they &s;aw the axe over their heads, they &s;unk down into the hold, and I
<PB N="11" REF="039087_0010_101399C4A79B2900">
in&s;tantly &s;hut the &s;kuttle over them; and, to make it more &s;ecure, I dragged a &s;mall anchor from the bow, by means of a rope round the windla&s;s, and laid it over the &s;kuttle.</P>
<P>Having now Peter&s;on and Baker &s;ecured, I pro|ceeded to Brous, who was on the &s;hrouds; at fir&s;t he had no intention of yielding, but cried out to his companions that they might come aft into the cabin, and proceed that way to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, while tho&s;e below were vociferating loudly to him; but, being in French, I did not perfectly under&s;tand.</P>
<P>But, when Brous &s;aw him&s;elf entirely at my mercy, he &s;upplicated with great earne&s;tne&s;s, that I would &s;pare his life, which I promi&s;ed to do, on condition that he would come down and &s;ub|mit him&s;elf to be confined, and behave in every re&s;pect as I directed him. He was &s;ome time be|fore he could be per&s;uaded to believe that I would &s;pare him: However, on my further a&s;&s;urances, he was prevailed on to come down; as &s;oon as he was on deck, he fell on his knees, took me by the hand, and ki&s;&s;ed it &s;everal times, making, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tations of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. I then ordered him to put his hands behind him, that I might tie them, which he in&s;tantly com|plied with; I then got a chain, and chained him upon deck to the ring-bolts. Brous being thus &s;ecured, I &s;et about taking the nece&s;&s;ary precau|tions
<PB N="12" REF="039087_0011_10139982954BEB68">
for pre&s;erving what I had gained; I, therefore, went into the cabin, and brought up bi&s;cuit and other provi&s;ions, together with my quadrant, books, &amp;c. and &s;ecured the cabin, le&s;t they might force a pa&s;&s;age that way.</P>
<P>I now &s;aw that I had an arduous ta&s;k to ac|compli&s;h, to navigate a &s;chooner alone, and to watch my pri&s;oners; from whom (if they had accompli&s;hed their intents) I could expect no mercy; but, when I compared it with what I had already &s;uffered, it appeared a plea&s;ure. The mo&s;t difficult part I thought was over, and that I had only to &s;uffer &s;ome privations, to tru&s;t to the protection of the Almighty, and my own vigilance. When I regained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;chooner, I found my&s;elf in latitude 25 deg. North, and in longitude 60 deg. We&s;t. My pri&s;oners below had plenty of provi&s;ions; but they were in darkne&s;s, and had no water. To prevent them making any attempts to regain their liberty, I did not think it proper to drive them to de&s;peration; but to &s;how them that I was willing to let them live, and enjoy as many com|forts as was con&s;i&s;tent with my own &s;afety: I burnt a hole with a &s;pike, in the fore-&s;cuttle, through which I could pour water and other refre&s;hments; &s;o that, after &s;everal attempts to break through, and believing that I had killed Brous, and thrown him overboard, they de&s;i&s;ted, and &s;eemed to &s;ubmit to
<PB N="13" REF="039087_0012_101399C72690C5B0">
their fate. As for Brous, who was on deck, I &s;uf|fered him, at meal times, to have the partial u&s;e of his limbs, to change his po&s;ition, &amp;c. but I would by no means &s;uffer him to &s;peak aloud, or be for a moment totally unfettered; for, my greate&s;t fears were from his getting loo&s;e, and &s;uddenly &s;urpriz|ing me, while I was in a &s;lumber; for, I never lay down, or had any profound &s;leep while they were under my charge.</P>
<P>On the 4th of October, being thirteen days after the recapture of the ve&s;&s;el, Providence dur|ing all that time having ble&s;&s;ed me with favour|able weather, except one gale, which la&s;ted twen|ty-four hours, I di&s;covered the i&s;land of St. Bar|tholomew's, and at 7, P. M. was off the harbour; and, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Swedi&s;h &s;chooner, an|chored to the leeward of the harbour, and at 10, P. M. John Peter&s;on, E&s;q. commander of his Swedi&s;h maje&s;ty's brig Hou&s;are, &s;ent his barge, with two officers and ten men, to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in which he was joined by A. Campbell, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> com|mander of the United States brig Eagle, and, on the 5th in&s;tant, anchored &s;afe in port; and after being moored, I landed, and entered a prote&s;t again&s;t the pri&s;oners, for murder and piracy, with Job Wall, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> con&s;ul for the United States of America, who had the murderers put in irons, on board of the afore&s;aid United States brig Eagle,
<PB N="14" REF="039087_0013_1013998662E7E9C0">
with orders to be delivered up to Thomas Tingey, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> commander of the United States &s;hip Ganges, and commodore of the leeward &s;tation.</P>
<P>After delivering up my pri&s;oners to captain Campbell, I was politely treated by the merchants and other inhabitants of the i&s;land; but, the go|vernment made a claim of &s;alvage, for the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance the Swedi&s;h brig had given me, in bring|ing the ve&s;&s;el to her anchorage. However, I re|&s;i&s;ted the claim thus &s;et up, and &s;howed that it was contrary to the treaty with Sweden; but was obliged to pay two hundred dollars to the &s;ailors of the Swedi&s;h brig for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Soon after I &s;old my cargo, and purcha&s;ed another of &s;ugars, and having hired fre&s;h hands, I &s;ailed from St. Bartholomew's on the 4th November, and ar|rived at Glouce&s;ter-Point the 25th of the &s;ame month.</P>
<P>When the pri&s;oners were brought to Philadel|phia, they underwent an examination before judge Peters, in which they confe&s;&s;ed the piracy and murder, differing very little in the detail of the circum&s;tances from the foregoing narrative: The plea which they &s;et up in their defence was, that they were French pri&s;oners, and in the &s;ervice of the French Republic: That one of them, Brous, alias La Roche, bore a commi&s;&s;ion under that go|vernment, and therefore they had a right to make
<PB N="15" REF="039087_0014_101399C8ADB4E998">
prize of an American ve&s;&s;el, and to kill any per&s;on that re&s;i&s;ted the attempt. But, the judge having con&s;idered that they entered voluntarily into the American &s;ervice, objected to their plea, and or|dered them to pri&s;on for trial. Peter&s;on, alias La Croix, has not the lea&s;t appearance of being a Frenchman, though he &s;peaks bad French, having been probably on board a French &s;hip, and it is more likely that he is a Dane or a Swede. As for Boulanger, alias Baker, we have good authority to &s;ay, that he is a Canadian, that he was born at Les-trois-riviers, of a creditable family, and was a &s;oldier in a regiment called the Royal Canadians, in the &s;ervice of his Britannic maje&s;ty, from which he de&s;erted in the &s;pring of 1799, and came into New-York &s;tate, by the way of Lake Champlain; &s;o that it is not probable that he was ever in the &s;ervice of France, or at &s;ea before this fatal voyage. And it is highly probable that Brous, alias La Roche, is al&s;o a Canadian.</P>
<P>Their trial came on in the circuit court of the United States, before judges Cha&s;e and Peters, on Monday, the 21&s;t April; they having for council, Me&s;&s;rs. Dallas, Moylan and Duponceau; the only evidence again&s;t them was my&s;elf, and their har|dened conduct; and judge Peters, who was called upon to give the &s;ub&s;tance of their examination
<PB N="16" REF="039087_0015_10139987EA0700B0">
before him, previous to their commitment for trial, the jury, after retiring a &s;hort time, brought in a verdict of GUILTY.</P>
<P><HI>Sentences of Death was pa&s;&s;ed upon them on Friday, the</HI> 25<HI>th April, and they are ordered for Execution on the</HI> 9<HI>th May.</HI></P>
<P>I thought it my duty, not only from repeated &s;olicitations, but that I might be relieved from numerous verbal narrations, to &s;end this to Mr. Folwell's pre&s;s. I have no emolument in its pub|lication; and &s;o far from &s;etting down "aught in malice," I forgive them, as they are my fellow-creatures; but they mu&s;t abide by the lenient laws of my country; and hope their God, who is my God, will be merciful.</P>
