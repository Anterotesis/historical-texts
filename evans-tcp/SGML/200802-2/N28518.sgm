<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a &s;ingular inju&s;tice which is often exerci&s;ed towards women, fir&s;t to give them a very defective Education, and then to expect from them the mo&s;t undeviating purity of conduct;&mdash;to train them in &s;uch a manner as &s;hall lay them open to the mo&s;t dangerous faults, and then to cen&s;ure them for not proving faultle&s;s. Is it not unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t, to expre&s;s di&s;appointment if our daughters &s;hould, in their &s;ub&s;equent lives, turn out preci&s;ely that very kind of character for which it would be evident to an un|prejudiced by-&s;tander that the whole &s;cope and tenor of their in&s;truction had been &s;y&s;tematically prepar|ing them?</P>
<P>Some reflections on the pre&s;ent erroneous &s;y&s;tem are here with great deference &s;ubmitted to public con&s;ideration. The Author is apprehen&s;ive that &s;he &s;hall be accu&s;ed of betraying the intere&s;ts of her &s;ex by laying open their defects: but &s;urely, an earne&s;t wi&s;h to turn their attention to objects calculated to
<PB N="x" REF="037996_0009_100FA9161FAD7B58">
promote their true dignity, is not the office of an enemy. So to expo&s;e the weakne&s;s of the land as to &s;ugge&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of internal improvement, and to point out the means of effectual defence, is not treachery, but patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>Again, it may be objected to this little work, that many errors are here a&s;cribed to women which by no means belong to them <HI>exclu&s;ively,</HI> and that it &s;eems to confine to the &s;ex tho&s;e faults which are common to the &s;pecies: but this is in &s;ome mea&s;ure unavoida|ble. In &s;peaking on the qualities of one &s;ex, the morali&s;t is &s;omewhat in the &s;ituation of the Geo|grapher, who is treating on the nature of one coun|try:&mdash;the air, &s;oil, and produce of the land which he is de&s;cribing, cannot fail in many e&s;&s;ential points to re&s;emble tho&s;e of other countries under the &s;ame parallel; yet it is his bu&s;ine&s;s to de&s;cant on the one without adverting to the other: and though in drawing his map he may happen to introduce &s;ome of the neighbouring coa&s;t, yet his principal attention mu&s;t be confined to that country which he propo&s;es to de&s;cribe, without taking into account the re&s;em|bling circum&s;tances of the adjacent &s;hores.</P>
<P>It may be al&s;o objected that the opinion here &s;ug|ge&s;ted on the &s;tate of manners among the higher cla&s;&s;es of our country-women, may &s;eem to contro|vert the ju&s;t encomiums of modern travellers, who
<PB N="xi" REF="037996_0010_100FA918B6A2E488">
generally concur in a&s;cribing a decided &s;uperiority to the ladies of this country over tho&s;e of every other. But &s;uch is the &s;tate of foreign manners, that the comparative prai&s;e is almo&s;t an injury to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> women. To be flattered for excelling tho&s;e who&s;e &s;tandard of excellence is very low, is but a degrading kind of commendation; for the value of all prai&s;e derived from &s;uperiority depends on the worth of the competitor. The character of Briti&s;h ladies, with all the unparalleled advantages they po&s;&s;e&s;s, mu&s;t never be determined by a compari&s;on with the wo|men of other nations, but by what they them&s;elves might be if all their talents and unrivalled opportuni|ties were turned to the be&s;t account.</P>
<P>Again, it may be &s;aid, that the Author is le&s;s di&s;|po&s;ed to expatiate on excellence than error: but the office of the hi&s;torian of human manners is delinea|tion rather than panegyric. Were the end in view eulogium and not improvement, eulogium would have been far more gratifying, nor would ju&s;t ob|jects for prai&s;e have been difficult to find. Even in her own limited &s;phere of ob&s;ervation, the Author is acquainted with much excellence in the cla&s;s of which &s;he treats;&mdash;with women who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing learning which would be thought exten&s;ive in the other &s;ex, &s;et an example of deep humility to their own;&mdash;women who, di&s;tingui&s;hed for wit and ge|nius,
<PB N="xii" REF="037996_0011_100FA91A427A3F30">
are eminent for dome&s;tic qualities;&mdash;who, ex|celling in the fine arts, have carefully enriched their under&s;tandings;&mdash;who, enjoying great affluence, de|vote it to the glory of God;&mdash;who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing ele|vated rank, think their noble&s;t &s;tyle and title is that of a Chri&s;tian.&mdash;</P>
<P>That there is al&s;o much worth which is little known, &s;he is per&s;uaded; for it is the mode&s;t nature of goodne&s;s to exert it&s;elf quietly, while a few cha|racters of the oppo&s;ite ca&s;t &s;eem, by the rumour of their exploits, to fill the world; and by their noi&s;e to multiply their numbers. It often happens that a very &s;mall party of people, by occupying the fore|ground, &s;o &s;eize the public attention, and monopo|lize the public talk, that <HI>they</HI> appear to be the great body: and a few active &s;pirits, provided their activi|ty take the wrong turn and &s;upport the wrong cau&s;e, &s;eem to fill the &s;cene; and a few di&s;turbers of or|der, who have the talent of thus exciting a fal&s;e idea of their multitudes by their mi&s;chiefs, actually gain &s;trength and &s;well their numbers by this fal|lacious arithmetic.</P>
<P>But the pre&s;ent work is no more intended for a panegyric on tho&s;e purer characters who &s;eek not human prai&s;e becau&s;e they act from a higher motive, than for a &s;atire on the avowedly licentious, who, urged by the impul&s;e of the moment or led away
<PB N="xiii" REF="037996_0012_100FA91D0D3443A8">
by the love of fa&s;hion, di&s;like not cen&s;ure, &s;o it may &s;erve to re&s;cue them from neglect or oblivion.</P>
<P>There are, however, multitudes of the young and the well-di&s;po&s;ed, who have as yet taken no decided part, who are ju&s;t launching on the ocean of life, ju&s;t about to lo&s;e their own right convictions, and to counteract their better propen&s;ities, unreluctantly yielding them&s;elves to be carried down the tide of popular practices, &s;anguine and confident of &s;afe|ty.&mdash;To the&s;e the Author would gently hint, that, when once embarked, it will be no longer ea&s;y to &s;ay to their pa&s;&s;ions, or even to their principles, "Thus far &s;hall ye go, and no further."</P>
<P>Should any reader revolt at what is conceived <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> be unwarranted &s;trictne&s;s in this little book, let it not be thrown by in di&s;gu&s;t before the following &s;hort con&s;ideration be weighed.&mdash;If in this Chri&s;tian country we are actually beginning to regard the &s;o|lemn office of Bapti&s;m as merely furni&s;hing an article to the pari&s;h regi&s;ter;&mdash;if we are learning from our indefatigable Teachers, to con&s;ider this Chri&s;tian rite as a legal ceremony retained for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of recording the <HI>age</HI> of our children;&mdash;then, in|deed, the prevailing Sy&s;tem of Education and Man|ners on which the&s;e volumes pre&s;ume to animadvert, may be adopted with propriety and per&s;i&s;ted in with &s;afety, without entailing on our children or on our|&s;elves
<PB N="xiv" REF="037996_0013_100FA9210381F6E8">
the peril of broken promi&s;es or the guilt of vio|lated vows.&mdash;But, if the obligation which Chri&s;tian Bapti&s;m impo&s;es be really binding;&mdash;if the ordinance have, indeed, a meaning beyond a mere &s;ecular tran&s;|action, beyond a record of names and dates;&mdash;if it be an in&s;titution by which the child is &s;olemnly devoted to God as his Father, to Je&s;us Chri&s;t as his Saviour, and to the Holy Spirit as his Sanctifier; if there be no definite period a&s;&s;igned when the obli|gation of fulfilling the duties it enjoins &s;hall be &s;u|per&s;eded;&mdash;if, having once dedicated our offspring to their Creator, we no longer dare to mock Him by bringing them up in ignorance of His Will and neglect of His Laws;&mdash;if, after having enli&s;ted them under the banners of Chri&s;t, to fight manfully again&s;t the three great enemies of mankind, we are no longer at liberty to let them lay down their arms; much le&s;s to lead them to act as if in alliance in&s;tead of ho&s;tility with the&s;e enemies;&mdash;if after having pro|mi&s;ed that they &s;hall renounce the vanities of the world, we are not allowed to invalidate the engage|ment;&mdash;if after &s;uch a covenant we &s;hould tremble to make the&s;e renounced vanities the &s;upreme object of our own pur&s;uit or of <HI>their</HI> in&s;truction;&mdash;if all this be really &s;o, then the Strictures on Modern Education, and on the Habits of poli&s;hed Life, will not be found &s;o repugnant to truth, and rea&s;on, and

common &s;en&s;e, as may on a fir&s;t view be &s;up|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>But if on candidly &s;umming up the evidence, the de&s;ign and &s;cope of the Author be fairly judged, not by the cu&s;toms or opinions of the worldly, (for every Engli&s;h &s;ubject has a right to object to a &s;u&s;|pected or prejudiced jury,) but by an appeal to that divine law which is the only infallible rule of judg|ment; if on &s;uch an appeal her views and princi|ples &s;hall be found cen&s;urable for their rigour, ab|&s;urd in their requi&s;itions, or prepo&s;terous in their re&s;trictions, &s;he will have no right to complain of &s;uch a verdict, becau&s;e &s;he will then &s;tand con|demned by that court to who&s;e deci&s;ion &s;he impli|citly &s;ubmits.</P>
<P>Let it not be &s;u&s;pected that the Author arrogant|ly conceives her&s;elf to be exempt from that natural corruption of the heart which it is one chief object of this &s;light work to exhibit; that &s;he &s;upercili|ou&s;ly erects her&s;elf into the impeccable cen&s;or of her &s;ex and of the world; as if from the critic's chair &s;he were coldly pointing out the faults and errors of another order of beings, in who&s;e welfare &s;he had not that lively intere&s;t which can only flow from the tender and intimate participation of fellow-feeling.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Addre&s;s to women of rank and fortune, on the effects of their influence on &s;ociety.&mdash;Sugge&s;tions for the exertion of it in various in&s;tances.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AMONG the talents for the application of which women of the higher cla&s;s will be peculiarly account|able, there is one, the importance of which they can &s;carcely rate too highly. This talent is influence. We read of the greate&s;t orator of antiquity, that the wi&s;e&s;t plans which it had co&s;t him years to frame, a woman could overturn in a &s;ingle day; and when one con&s;iders the variety of mi&s;chiefs which an ill-directed influence has been known to produce, one is led to reflect with the mo&s;t &s;anguine hope on the
<PB N="18" REF="037996_0017_100FA92BCF3EDCD0">
beneficial effects to be expected from the &s;ame power|ful force when exerted in its true direction.</P>
<P>The general &s;tate of civilized &s;ociety depends, more than tho&s;e are aware, who are not accu&s;tomed to &s;crutinize into the &s;prings of human action, on the prevailing &s;entiments and habits of women, and on the nature and degree of the e&s;timation in which they are held. Even tho&s;e who admit the power of fe|male elegance on the manners of men, do not always attend to the influence of female principles on their character. In the former ca&s;e, indeed, women are apt to be &s;ufficiently con&s;cious of their power, and not backward in turning it to account. But there are nobler objects to be effected by the exertion of their powers, and unfortunately, ladies, who are often unrea&s;onably confident where they ought to be diffi|dent, are &s;ometimes capriciou&s;ly diffident ju&s;t when they ought to feel where their true importance lies; and, feeling, to exert it. To u&s;e their boa&s;ted power over mankind to no higher purpo&s;e than the gratifi|cation of vanity or the indulgence of plea&s;ure, is the degrading triumph of tho&s;e fair victims to luxury, caprice, and de&s;poti&s;m, whom the laws and the reli|gion of the voluptuous prophet of Arabia exclude from light, and liberty, and knowledge; and it is humbling to reflect, that in tho&s;e countries in which fondne&s;s for the mere per&s;ons of women is carried to the highe&s;t exce&s;s, <HI>they are &s;laves;</HI> and that their
<PB N="19" REF="037996_0018_100FA92E63BEC1C0">
moral and intellectual degradation increa&s;es in direct proportion to the adoration which is paid to mere external charms.</P>
<P>But I turn to the bright rever&s;e of this mortifying &s;cene; to a country where our &s;ex enjoys the ble&s;|&s;ings of liberal in&s;truction, of rea&s;onable laws, of a pure religion, and all the endearing plea&s;ures of an equal, &s;ocial, virtuous, and delightful intercour&s;e: I turn with an earne&s;t hope, that women, thus richly endowed with the bounties of Providence, will not content them&s;elves with poli&s;hing, when they are able to reform; with entertaining, when they may awaken; and with captivating for a day, when they may bring into action powers of which the effects may be commen&s;urate with eternity.</P>
<P>In this moment of alarm and peril, I would call on them with a "warning voice," which would &s;tir up every latent principle in their minds, and kindle every &s;lumbering energy in their hearts; I would call on them to come forward, and contribute their full and fair proportion towards the &s;aving of their country. But I would call on them to come for|ward, without departing from the refinement of their character, without derogating from the dig|nity of their rank, without blemi&s;hing the delicacy of their &s;ex: I would call them to the be&s;t and mo&s;t appropriate exertion of their power, to rai&s;e the de|pre&s;&s;ed tone of public morals, and to awaken the
<PB N="20" REF="037996_0019_100FA92FEB5D0B30">
drow&s;y &s;pirit of religious principle. They know too well how arbitrarily they give the law to man|ners, and with how de&s;potic a &s;way they fix the &s;tandard of fa&s;hion. But this is not enough; this is a low mark, a prize not worthy of their high and holy calling. For, on the u&s;e which women of the &s;uperior cla&s;s may be di&s;po&s;ed to make of that power delegated to them by the courte&s;y of cu&s;tom, by the hone&s;t gallantry of the heart, by the imperious con|trol of virtuous affections, by the habits of civilized &s;tates, by the u&s;ages of poli&s;hed &s;ociety; on the u&s;e, I &s;ay, which they &s;hall hereafter make of this in|fluence, will depend, in no low degree, the well-being of tho&s;e &s;tates, and the virtue and happine&s;s, nay perhaps the very exi&s;tence of that &s;ociety.</P>
<P>At this period, when our country can only hope to &s;tand by oppo&s;ing a bold and noble <HI>unanimity</HI> to the mo&s;t tremendous confederacies again&s;t religion, and order, and governments, which the world ever &s;aw; what an acce&s;&s;ion would it bring to the public &s;trength, could we prevail on beauty, and rank, and talents, and virtue, confederating their &s;everal pow|ers, to come forward with a patrioti&s;m at once firm and feminine for the general good! I am not found|ing an alarm to female warriors, nor exciting female politicians: I hardly know which of the two is the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting and unnatural character. Propriety is to a woman what the great Roman critic &s;ays
<PB N="21" REF="037996_0020_100FA93285C635E0">
action is to an orator; it is the fir&s;t, the &s;econd, the third requi&s;ite. A woman may be knowing, active, witty, and amu&s;ing; but without propriety &s;he can|not be amiable. Propriety is the centre in which all the lines of duty and of agreeablene&s;s meet. It is to character what proportion is to figure, and grace to attitude. It does not depend on any one perfection; but it is the re&s;ult of general excellence. It &s;hews it&s;elf by a regular, orderly, undeviating cour&s;e; and never &s;tarts from its &s;ober orbit into any &s;plendid ec|centricities; for it would be a&s;hamed of &s;uch prai&s;e as it might extort by any aberrations from its proper path. It renounces all commendation but what is characteri&s;tic; and I would make it the criterion of true ta&s;te, right principle, and genuine feeling, in a woman, whether &s;he would be le&s;s touched with all the flattery of romantic and exaggerated panegyric than with that beautiful picture of correct and ele|gant propriety, which Milton draws of our fir&s;t mo|ther, when he delineates
<Q><L>Tho&s;e thou&s;and <HI>decencies</HI> which daily flow</L>
<L>From all her words and actions.</L></Q></P>
<P>Even the influence of religion is to be exerci&s;ed with di&s;cretion. A female Polemic wanders almo&s;t as far from the limits pre&s;cribed to her &s;ex, as a female Machiavel or warlike Thale&s;tris. Fiercene&s;s has made almo&s;t as few converts as the &s;word, and both are peculiarly ungraceful in a female. Even
<PB N="22" REF="037996_0021_100F7C599F509230">
<HI>religious</HI> violence has human tempers of its own to indulge, and is gratifying it&s;elf when it would be thought to be &s;erving God. Let not the bigot place her natural pa&s;&s;ions to the account of Chri&s;tianity, or imagine &s;he is pious when &s;he is only pa&s;&s;ionate. Let her bear in mind that a Chri&s;tian doctrine is al|ways to be defended with a Chri&s;tian &s;pirit, and not make her&s;elf amends by the &s;toutne&s;s of her ortho|doxy for the badne&s;s of her temper.

<P>There was a time when a variety of epithets were thought nece&s;&s;ary to expre&s;s various kinds of excel|lence, and when the different qualities of the mind were di&s;tingui&s;hed by appropriate and di&s;criminating terms; when the words venerable, learned, &s;agacious, pro|found, acute, pious, ingenious, elegant, agreeable, wi&s;e, or witty, were u&s;ed as &s;pecific marks of di&s;tinct characters.

<P>We ought to be more on our guard again&s;t this &s;pirit of ridicule, becau&s;e, whatever may be the cha|racter of the pre&s;ent day, its faults do not &s;pring from the redundancies of great qualities, or the overflowings of extravagant virtues. It is well if more correct views of life, a more regular admini|&s;tration of laws, and a more &s;ettled &s;tate of &s;ociety, have helped to re&s;train the exce&s;&s;es of the heroic ages, when love and war were con&s;idered as the great and &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s of human life.

But let us not forget, in the in&s;olence of acknowledged &s;uperiority, that it was religion and cha&s;tity, operating on the romantic &s;pirit of tho&s;e times, which e&s;tabli&s;hed the de&s;potic &s;way of woman; and though &s;he now no longer looks down on her adoring votaries, from the pede&s;tal to which an ab&s;urd idolatry had lifted her, yet let her remem|ber that it is the &s;ame religion and cha&s;tity which once rai&s;ed her to &s;uch an elevation, that mu&s;t &s;till furni&s;h the noble&s;t energies of her character.</P>

<P>One cannot but be &s;truck with the wonderful contra&s;t exhibited to our view, when we contem|plate the manners of the two periods in que&s;tion.

a&s;hamed of his doctrines, and not a few reject his &s;acrifice. Too many con&s;ider Chri&s;tianity rather as a political than a religious di&s;tinction; too many claim the appellation of Chri&s;tians, in mere oppo&s;i|tion to that Democracy with which they conceive infidelity to be a&s;&s;ociated, rather than from an ab|horrence of impiety for its own &s;ake; and dread ir|religion as the badge of a reprobated party, more than on account of that moral corruption which is its in&s;eparable concomitant.</P>
<P>But in an age when inver&s;ion is the order of the day, the modern idea of improvement does not con|&s;i&s;t in altering, but extirpating. We do not reform, but &s;ubvert. We do not correct old &s;y&s;tems, but demoli&s;h them; fancying that when every thing &s;hall be new it will be perfect. Not to have been wrong, but to have been at all, is the crime. Excellence is no longer con&s;idered as an experimental thing which is to grow gradually out of ob&s;ervation and practice, and to be improved by the accumulating additions brought by the wi&s;dom of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages. <HI>Our wi&s;dom</HI> is not &s;lowly perfected by age and gradual growth, but a godde&s;s which &s;tarts at once, full grown, mature, armed cap-&agrave;-pee, from the heads of our modern thunderers. Or rather, if I may change the allu&s;ion, a perfect &s;y&s;tem is <HI>now</HI> expect|ed inevitably to &s;pring at once, like the fabled bird of Arabia, from the a&s;hes of its parent; and, like
<PB N="33" REF="037996_0032_100FA95210FD1348">
that, can receive its birth no other way but by the de&s;truction of its predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of clearing away what is redundant, prun|ing what is cumber&s;ome, &s;upplying what is defective, and amending what is wrong, we adopt the indefi|nite rage for radical reform of Jack, who in altering Lord Peter's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Swift's "Tale of a Tub."</NOTE> coat, &s;hewed his zeal by crying out, <Q>Tear away, brother Martin, for the love of hea|ven; never mind, &s;o you do but tear away.</Q></P>
<P>This tearing &s;y&s;tem has unque&s;tionably rent away &s;ome valuable parts of that &s;trong, rich, native &s;tuff, which formed the ancient texture of Briti&s;h manners. That we have gained much I am per&s;uaded; that we have lo&s;t nothing I dare not therefore affirm. But though it fairly exhibits a mark of our improved judgment to ridicule the fanta&s;tic notions of love and honour in the heroic ages; let us not rejoice that that &s;pirit of genero&s;ity in &s;entiment, and of ardour in piety, the exuberancies of which were then &s;o incon|venient, are now &s;unk as unrea&s;onably low. That revolution of manners which the unparalleled wit and genius of Don Quixote &s;o happily effected, by aboli&s;hing extravagancies the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and perni|cious, was &s;o far imperfect, that &s;ome virtues which he never meant to expo&s;e, fell into di&s;repute with the ab&s;urdities which he did: and it is become the turn
<PB N="34" REF="037996_0033_100FA955B9AE2CA0">
of the pre&s;ent ta&s;te to attach in no &s;mall degree that which is ridiculous to that which is &s;erious and heroic. Some modern works of wit have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in bringing piety and &s;ome of the noble&s;t virtues into contempt, by &s;tudiou&s;ly a&s;&s;ociating them with oddity, childi&s;h &s;implicity, and ignorance of the world: and unnece&s;&s;ary pains have been taken to extingui&s;h that zeal and ardour, which, however liable to exce&s;s and error, are yet the &s;pring of whatever is great and excellent in the human character. The novel of Cervantes is incomparable; the Tartuffe of Moliere is unequalled; but true genero&s;ity and true religion will never lo&s;e any thing of their intrin&s;ic value, be|cau&s;e knight-errantry and hypocri&s;y are legitimate objects for &s;atire.</P>
<P>But to return from this too long digre&s;&s;ion, to the &s;ubject of female influence. Tho&s;e who have not watched the united operation of vanity and feeling on a youthful mind, will not conceive how much le&s;s formidable the ridicule of all his own &s;ex will be to a very young man, than that of tho&s;e women to whom he has been taught to look up as the arbi|tre&s;&s;es of elegance. Such an one, I doubt not, might be able to work him&s;elf up, by the force of genuine chri&s;tian principle, to &s;uch a pitch of true heroi&s;m, as to refu&s;e a challenge, (and it requires more real courage to refu&s;e a challenge than to ac|cept one,) who would yet be in danger of relap&s;ing

While we have cleared away the rubbi&s;h of the Gothic ages, it were to be wi&s;hed we had not retained the mo&s;t criminal of all their in&s;titutions. Why chivalry &s;hould indi|cate a madman, while its leading object, the <HI>&s;ingle combat,</HI> &s;hould de&s;ignate a gentleman, has not yet been explained. Nay the original motive is lo&s;t, while the &s;inful practice is continued; for the fighter of the duel no longer <HI>pretends</HI> to be a glorious re|dre&s;&s;er of the wrongs of &s;trangers; no longer con|&s;iders him&s;elf as piou&s;ly appealing to heaven for the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e; but from the &s;lavi&s;h fear of un|merited reproach, often &s;elfi&s;hly hazards the happi|ne&s;s of his neare&s;t connections, and always comes forth in direct defiance of an acknowledged com|mand of the Almighty. Perhaps there are few oc|ca&s;ions in which female influence might be exerted to a higher purpo&s;e than in this, in which laws and con&s;cience have hitherto effected &s;o little. But while the duelli&s;t (who perhaps becomes a duelli&s;t only be|cau&s;e he was fir&s;t a &s;educer) is welcomed with &s;miles; the more hardy youth, who, becau&s;e he fears not man but God, declines a challenge; who is re&s;olved to brave di&s;grace rather than commit &s;in, would be treated with cool contempt by tho&s;e very per&s;ons to

who&s;e e&s;teem he might rea&s;onably look, as one of the rewards of his true and &s;ub&s;tantial fortitude.</P>
<P>How then is it to be reconciled with the deci&s;ions of principle, that delicate women &s;hould receive with complacency the &s;ucce&s;sful libertine, who has been detected by the wretched father or the injured hu&s;band in a criminal commerce, the di&s;covery of which has too ju&s;tly bani&s;hed the unhappy partner of his crime from virtuous &s;ociety? Nay, if he hap|pen to be very hand&s;ome, or very brave, or very fa&s;hionable, is there not &s;ometimes a kind of di&s;|honourable competition for his favour?

<P>May I be allowed to introduce a new part of my &s;ubject, by remarking that it is a matter of incon|ceivable importance, though not perhaps &s;ufficiently con&s;idered, when any popular work, not on a religi|ous topic, but on any common &s;ubject, &s;uch as poli|tics, hi&s;tory, or &s;cience, has happened to be written
<PB N="37" REF="037996_0036_100FA95DD79C28B0">
by an author of &s;ound Chri&s;tian principles? It may not have been nece&s;&s;ary, nor prudently practicable, to have a &s;ingle page in the whole work profe&s;&s;edly re|ligious: but &s;till, when the living principle informs the mind of the writer, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible but that &s;omething of its &s;pirit will diffu&s;e it&s;elf even in|to &s;ubjects with which it &s;hould &s;eem but remotely connected.

politics, deplorable profligacy, and impudent infide|lity. Rou&s;&s;eau was the fir&s;t popular di&s;pen&s;er of this complicated drug, in which the deleterious infu|&s;ion was &s;trong, and the effect proportionably fatal. For he does not attempt to &s;educe the affections but through the medium of the principles. He does not paint an innocent woman, ruined, repenting, and re|&s;tored; but with a far more mi&s;chievous refinement, he annihilates the value of cha&s;tity, and with perni|cious &s;ubtlety attempts to make his heroine appear almo&s;t more amiable without it. He exhibits a vir|tuous woman, the victim not of temptation but of rea&s;on, not of vice but of &s;entiment, not of pa&s;&s;ion but of conviction; and &s;trikes at the very root of honour by elevating a crime into a principle. With a metaphy&s;ical &s;ophi&s;try the mo&s;t plau&s;ible, he de|bauches the heart of woman, by cheri&s;hing her va|nity in the erection of a &s;y&s;tem of male virtues, to which, with a lofty dereliction of tho&s;e that are her more peculiar and characteri&s;tic prai&s;e, he tempts her to a&s;pire; powerfully in&s;inuating, that to this &s;plen|did &s;y&s;tem cha&s;tity does not nece&s;&s;arily belong: thus corrupting the judgment and bewildering the under|&s;tanding, as the mo&s;t effectual way to inflame the imagination and deprave the heart.</P>

principles are not yet formed. He allures the warm|hearted to embrace vice, not becau&s;e they prefer vice, but becau&s;e he gives to vice &s;o natural an air of vir|tue: and ardent and enthu&s;ia&s;tic youth, too confi|dently tru&s;ting in their integrity and in their teacher, will be undone, while they fancy they are indulging in the noble&s;t feelings of their nature. Many authors will more infallibly complete the ruin of the loo&s;e and ill-di&s;po&s;ed, but perhaps (if I may change the figure) there never was a net of &s;uch exqui&s;ite art and inextricable workman&s;hip, &s;pread to entangle innocence and en&s;nare inexperience, as the writings of Rou&s;&s;eau: and, unhappily, the victim does not even &s;truggle in the toils, becau&s;e part of the delu|&s;ion con&s;i&s;ts in imagining that he is &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>Some of our recent popular publications have adopted and enlarged all the mi&s;chiefs of this &s;chool, and the principal evil ari&s;ing from them is, that the virtues they exhibit are almo&s;t more dangerous than the vices. The chief materials out of which the&s;e delu&s;ive &s;y&s;tems are framed, are characters who practi&s;e &s;uperfluous acts of genero&s;ity, while they are trampling on obvious and commanded duties; who combine inflated &s;entiments of honour with ac|tions the mo&s;t flagitious; a high tone of &s;elf-confi|dence, with a perpetual neglect of &s;elf-denial: pa|thetic apo&s;trophes to the pa&s;&s;ions, but no attempt to re&s;i&s;t them.

Alas! they do not know that the be&s;t creature of impul&s;e that ever liv|ed is but a wayward, unfixed, unprincipled being! that the be&s;t <HI>natural</HI> man requires a curb; and needs that balance to the affections which Chri&s;tianity alone can furni&s;h, and without which benevolent pro|pen&s;ities are no &s;ecurity to virtue.

<P>But there is another object to which I would direct the exertion of that power of female influence of which I am &s;peaking.

<P>But let us not on account of this victory re|po&s;e in confident &s;ecurity. The modern apo&s;tles of infidelity and immorality, little le&s;s indefatigable in di&s;per&s;ing their pernicious doctrines than the fir&s;t apo&s;tles were in propagating go&s;pel truths, have indeed changed their weapons, but they have by no means de&s;i&s;ted from the attack. To de&s;troy the principles of Chri&s;tianity in this i&s;land, appears at the pre&s;ent moment to be their grand aim. De|prived of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the French pre&s;s, they are now attempting to attain their object under the clo&s;e and more artificial veil of German literature. Con&s;cious that religion and morals will &s;tand or fall together, their attacks are &s;ometimes levelled again&s;t the one and &s;ometimes again&s;t the other. With &s;trong occa&s;ional profe&s;&s;ions of general at|tachment to both of the&s;e, they endeavour to intere&s;t the feelings of the reader, &s;ometimes in favour of &s;ome one particular vice, at other times on the &s;ub|ject of &s;ome one objection to revealed religion. Po|etry as well as pro&s;e, romance as well as hi&s;tory, writings on philo&s;ophical as well as on political &s;ubjects, have thus been employed to in&s;til the prin|ciples of <HI>Illuminati&s;m,</HI> while incredible pains have been taken to obtain able tran&s;lations of every book which was &s;uppo&s;ed likely to be of u&s;e in corrupt|ing

the heart or mi&s;leading the under&s;tanding. In many of the&s;e tran&s;lations, certain &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ages, which, though well received in Germany, would have excited di&s;gu&s;t in England, are wholly omitted, in order that the mind may be more certainly, though more &s;lowly, prepared for the full effect of the &s;ame poi&s;on to be admini&s;tered in a &s;tronger de|gree at another period.</P>
<P>Let not tho&s;e to whom the&s;e pages are addre&s;&s;ed deceive them&s;elves, by &s;uppo&s;ing this to be a fable; and let them inquire mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly whether I &s;peak truth, in a&s;&s;erting that the attacks of infidelity in Great Britain are at this moment principally directed again&s;t the female brea&s;t. Con&s;cious of the influence of women in civil &s;ociety, con&s;cious of the effect which female infidelity produced in France, they at|tribute the ill &s;ucce&s;s of their attempts in this coun|try, to their having been hitherto chiefly addre&s;&s;ed to the male &s;ex.

<P>We have hitherto &s;poken only of the German <HI>writings;</HI> but becau&s;e there are multitudes who &s;el|dom read, equal pains have been taken to promote the &s;ame object through the medium of the &s;tage; and this weapon is, of all others, that again&s;t which it is, at the pre&s;ent moment, the mo&s;t impor|tant to warn the more incon&s;iderate of my country|women.</P>
<P>As a &s;pecimen of the German drama, it may not be un&s;ea&s;onable to offer a few remarks on the admir|ed play of the <HI>Stranger.</HI> In this piece the character of an <HI>adultre&s;s,</HI> which, in all periods of the world, ancient as well as modern, in all countries, heathen as well as chri&s;tian, has hitherto been held in dete&s;t|ation, and has never been introduced but to be re|probated, is for the fir&s;t time pre&s;ented to our view in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and fa&s;cinating colours. The heroine is a woman who for&s;ook a hu&s;band the mo&s;t affectionate and the mo&s;t amiable, and lived for &s;ome time in the mo&s;t criminal commerce with her &s;educ|er. Repenting at length of her crime, &s;he buries her&s;elf in retirement. The talents of the poet dur|ing the whole piece are exerted in attempting to ren|der this woman the object not only of the compa&s;&s;i|on and forgivene&s;s, but of the e&s;teem and affection, of the audience. The injured hu&s;band, convinced
<PB N="49" REF="037996_0048_100FA97CAAC6CA58">
of his wife's repentance, forms a re&s;olution, which every man of true feeling and chri&s;tian piety will probably approve. He forgives her offence, and promi&s;es her through life his advice, protection, and fortune, together with every thing which can alleviate the mi&s;ery of her &s;ituation, but refu&s;es to replace her in the &s;ituation of his wife. But this is not &s;ufficient for the <HI>German</HI> author. His efforts are employed, and it is to be feared but too &s;ucce&s;s|fully, in making the audience con&s;ider the hu&s;band as an unrelenting &s;avage, while they are led by the art of the poet anxiou&s;ly to wi&s;h to &s;ee an adultre&s;s re&s;tored to that rank of women who have not violat|ed the mo&s;t &s;olemn covenant that can be made with man, nor di&s;obeyed one of the mo&s;t po&s;itive laws which has been enjoined by God.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time that this fir&s;t attempt at re|pre&s;enting an adultre&s;s in an exemplary light was made by a German dramati&s;t, which forms an aera in manners; a direct vindication of adultery was for the fir&s;t time attempted by a <HI>woman,</HI> a profe&s;&s;ed admirer and imitator of the German &s;uicide Werter. <HI>The female Werter,</HI> as &s;he is &s;tyled by her biogra|pher, a&s;&s;erts, in a work intitled "The Wrongs of Women," that adultery is ju&s;tifiable, and that the re&s;trictions placed on it by the laws of England con&s;titute one of the <HI>Wrongs of Women.</HI></P>

For, from admiring to adopt|ing, the &s;tep is &s;hort, and the progre&s;s rapid; and it is in the moral as in the natural world; the mo|tion, in the ca&s;e of minds as well as of bodies, is accelerated as they approach the centre to which they are tending.</P>
<P>O ye to whom this addre&s;s is particularly direct|ed! an awful charge is, in this in&s;tance, committed to your hands; as you di&s;charge it or &s;hrink from it, you promote or injure the honour of your daugh|ters and the happine&s;s of your &s;ons, of both which you are the depo&s;itaries. And, while you re&s;olutely per&s;evere in making a &s;tand again&s;t the encroach|ments of this crime, &s;uffer not your firmne&s;s to be &s;haken by that affectation of charity, which is grow|ing into a general &s;ub&s;titute for principle. Abu&s;e not &s;o noble a quality as Chri&s;tian candour, by mi&s;|employing it in in&s;tances to which it does not apply. Pity the wretched woman you dare not countenance; and ble&s;s HIM who has "made you to differ." If

unhappily &s;he be your relation or friend, anxiou&s;ly watch for the period when &s;he &s;hall be de&s;erted by her betrayer; and &s;ee if, by your Chri&s;tian offices, &s;he can be &s;natched from a perpetuity of vice. But if, through the Divine ble&s;&s;ing on your patient en|deavours, &s;he &s;hould ever be awakened to remor&s;e, be not anxious to re&s;tore the forlorn penitent to that &s;ociety again&s;t who&s;e laws &s;he has &s;o grievou&s;ly of|fended; and remember, that her &s;oliciting &s;uch a re|&s;toration, furni&s;hes but too plain a proof that &s;he is not the penitent your partiality would believe; &s;ince penitence is more anxious to make its peace with Heaven than with the world. Joyfully would a truly contrite &s;pirit commute an earthly for an ever|la&s;ting reprobation! To re&s;tore a criminal to pub|lic &s;ociety, is perhaps to tempt her to repeat her crime, or to deaden her repentance for having com|mitted it, as well as to injure that &s;ociety; while to re&s;tore a &s;trayed &s;oul to God will add lu&s;tre to your Chri&s;tian character, and brighten your eternal crown.</P>
<P>In the mean time, there are other evils, ultimate|ly perhaps tending to this, into which we are fal|ling, through that &s;ort of fa&s;hionable candour which, as was hinted above, is among the mi&s;chievous cha|racteri&s;tics of the pre&s;ent day; of which period per|haps it is not the &s;malle&s;t evil, that vices are made to look &s;o like virtues, and are &s;o a&s;&s;imilated to
<PB N="55" REF="037996_0054_100FA98D6DC5E540">
them, that it requires watchfulne&s;s and judgment &s;ufficiently to analyze and di&s;criminate. There are certain women of good fa&s;hion who practi&s;e irregu|larities not con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;trictne&s;s of virtue; while their good &s;en&s;e and knowledge of the world make them at the &s;ame time keenly alive to the va|lue of reputation. They want to retain their indul|gences, without quite forfeiting their credit; but finding their fame fa&s;t declining, they artfully cling, by flattery and marked attentions, to a few per&s;ons of more than ordinary character; and thus, till they are driven to let go their hold, continue to prop a falling fame.</P>
<P>On the other hand, there are not wanting women of di&s;tinction, of very correct general conduct, and of no ordinary &s;en&s;e and virtue, who, confiding with a high mind on what they too confidently call <HI>the integrity of their own hearts;</HI> anxious to de|&s;erve a good fame on the one hand, by a life free from reproach, yet &s;ecretly too de&s;irous on the other of &s;ecuring a worldly and fa&s;hionable reputation; while their general a&s;&s;ociates are per&s;ons of ho|nour, and their general re&s;ort places of &s;afety; yet allow them&s;elves to be occa&s;ionally pre&s;ent at the midnight orgies of revelry and gaming, in hou&s;es of no honourable e&s;timation; and thus help to keep up characters, which, without their &s;u&s;taining hand, would &s;ink to their ju&s;t level of contempt and repro|bation.
<PB N="56" REF="037996_0055_100FA990097E38B8">
While they are holding out this plank to a drowning reputation, rather, it is to be feared, &s;hewing their own &s;trength than a&s;&s;i&s;ting another's weakne&s;s, they value them&s;elves, perhaps, on not partaking of the wor&s;t parts of the amu&s;ements which may be carrying on; but they &s;anction them by their pre&s;ence; they lend their countenance to cor|ruptions they &s;hould abhor, and their example to the young and inexperienced, who are looking about for &s;ome &s;uch &s;anction to ju&s;tify them in that which they were before inclined to, but were too timid to have ventured upon without the protection of &s;uch un&s;ullied names. Thus the&s;e re&s;pectable characters, without looking to the general con&s;equences of their indi&s;cretion, are thoughtle&s;sly employed in breaking down, as it were, the broad fence which &s;hould ever &s;eparate two very different &s;orts of &s;ociety, and are becoming a kind of unnatural link between vice and virtue.</P>
<P>There is a gro&s;s deception which even per&s;ons of reputation practi&s;e on them&s;elves. They loudly con|demn vice and irregularity as an ab&s;tract principle; nay, they &s;tigmatize them in per&s;ons of an oppo&s;ite party, or in tho&s;e from whom they them&s;elves have no pro&s;pect of per&s;onal advantage or amu&s;ement, and in whom therefore they have no particular intere&s;t to tolerate evil. But the &s;ame di&s;orders are viewed without abhorrence when practi&s;ed by tho&s;e who in

The more re&s;pect|able will not, perhaps, go all the length of vindi|cating the di&s;reputable vice, but they affect to di&s;be|lieve its exi&s;tence in the individual in&s;tance; or, failing in this, they will bury its acknowledged tur|pitude in the &s;educing qualities of the agreeable de|linquent. Talents of every kind are con&s;idered as a commutation for a few vices, and &s;uch are made a pa&s;&s;port to introduce into honourable &s;ociety cha|racters whom their profligacy ought to exclude from it.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is far from being the object of this &s;light work to offer a regular plan of female education, a ta&s;k which has been often more properly a&s;&s;umed by far abler writers; but it is intended rather to &s;ugge&s;t a few remarks on the reigning mode, which, though it has had many panegyri&s;ts, appears to be defective, not only in a few particulars, but as a general &s;y&s;tem. There are indeed numberle&s;s honourable exceptions to an ob&s;ervation which will be thought &s;evere; yet the author que&s;tions if it be not the natural and di|rect tendency of the prevailing and popular &s;y&s;tem, to excite and promote tho&s;e very defects, which it ought to be the main end and object of Chri&s;tian education to remove; whether, in&s;tead of directing this important engine to attack and de&s;troy vanity, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and incon&s;ideration, that triple alliance in league again&s;t female virtue; the combined powers
<PB N="60" REF="037996_0059_100FA999A9437230">
of in&s;truction are not &s;edulou&s;ly confederated in con|firming their &s;trength and e&s;tabli&s;hing their empire?</P>
<P>If indeed the <HI>material</HI> &s;ub&s;tance, if the body and limbs, with the organs and &s;en&s;es, be really the more valuable objects of attention, then there is lit|tle room for animadver&s;ion and improvement. But if the immaterial and immortal mind; if the heart, "out of which are the i&s;&s;ues of life," be the main concern; if the great bu&s;ine&s;s of education be to im|plant ideas, to communicate knowledge, to form a correct ta&s;te and a &s;ound judgment, to re&s;i&s;t evil propen&s;ities, and, above all, to &s;eize the favourable &s;ea&s;on for infu&s;ing principles and confirming habits; if education be a &s;chool to fit us for life, and life be a &s;chool to fit us for eternity; if &s;uch, I repeat it, be the chief work and grand ends of education, it may then be worth inquiring how far the&s;e ends are likely to be effected by the prevailing &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Is it not a fundamental error to con&s;ider children as innocent beings, who&s;e little weakne&s;&s;es may per|haps want &s;ome correction, rather than as beings who bring into the world a corrupt nature and evil di&s;po&s;itions, which it &s;hould be the great end of education to rectify? This appears to be &s;uch a foundation-truth, that if I were a&s;ked what quality is mo&s;t important in an in&s;tructor of youth, I &s;hould not he&s;itate to reply, <HI>&s;uch a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of the corruption of our nature, as &s;hould in&s;ure a di&s;po&s;ition to</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="037996_0060_100FA99DB3FDC0E0">
<HI>counteract it: together with &s;uch a deep view and thorough knowledge of the human heart, as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for developing and controuling its mo&s;t &s;ecret and complicated workings.</HI> And let us remember that to <HI>know the world,</HI> as it is called, that is, to know its local manners, temporary u&s;ages, and evane&s;cent fa&s;hions, is not to <HI>know human nature:</HI> and where this prime knowledge is wanting, tho&s;e natural evils which ought to be counteracted will be fo&s;tered.</P>
<P>Vanity, for in&s;tance, is reckoned among the light and venial errors of youth; nay, &s;o far from being treated as a dangerous enemy, it is often called in as an auxiliary. At wor&s;t, it is con&s;idered as a harm|le&s;s weakne&s;s, which &s;ubtracts little from the value of a character; as a natural efferve&s;cence, which will &s;ub&s;ide of it&s;elf, when the fir&s;t ferment of the youthful pa&s;&s;ions &s;hall have done working. But tho&s;e know little of the conformation of the hu|man, and e&s;pecially of the female heart, who fan|cy that vanity is ever exhau&s;ted, by the mere opera|tion of time and events. Let tho&s;e who maintain this opinion look into our places of public re&s;ort, and there behold if the gho&s;t of departed beauty is not to its la&s;t flitting fond of haunting the &s;cenes of its pa&s;t plea&s;ures; the &s;oul, unwilling (if I may borrow an allu&s;ion from the Platonic mythology) to quit the &s;pot in which the body enjoyed its former delights, &s;till continues to hover about the &s;ame
<PB N="62" REF="037996_0061_100FA9A08B785338">
place, though the &s;ame plea&s;ures are no longer to be found there. Di&s;appointments indeed may divert vanity into a new direction; prudence may prevent it from breaking out into exce&s;&s;es, and age may prove that it is "vexation of &s;pirit;" but neither di&s;appointment, prudence, nor age can <HI>cure</HI> it; for they do not correct the principle. Nay, the very di&s;appointment it&s;elf &s;erves as a painful evidence of its protracted exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Since then there is a &s;ea&s;on when the youthful mu&s;t cea&s;e to be young, and the beautiful to excite admiration; to grow old gracefully is perhaps one of the rare&s;t and mo&s;t valuable arts which can be taught to woman. It is for this &s;ober &s;ea&s;on of life that education &s;hould lay up its rich re&s;ources. However di&s;regarded they may hitherto have been, they will be wanted now. When admirers fall away, and flatterers become mute, the mind will be driven to retire into it&s;elf, and if it find no entertain|ment at home, it will be driven back again upon the world with increa&s;ed force. Yet forgetting this, do we not &s;eem to educate our daughters, exclu&s;ively, for the tran&s;ient period of youth, when it is to ma|turer life we ought to advert? Do we not educate them for a crowd, forgetting that they are to live at home? for the world, and not for them&s;elves? for &s;how, and not for u&s;e? for time, and not for eter|nity?</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="037996_0062_100FA9A329EB4320">
Vanity (and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s) is not to be re&s;i&s;ted like any other vice, which is &s;ometimes bu&s;y and &s;ometimes quiet; it is not to be attacked as a &s;ingle fault, which is indulged in oppo|&s;ition to a &s;ingle virtue; but it is uniformly to be controlled, as an active, a re&s;tle&s;s, a growing princi|ple, at con&s;tant war with all the Chri&s;tian graces; which not only mixes it&s;elf with all our faults, but in&s;inuates it&s;elf into all our virtues too; and will, if not checked effectually, rob our be&s;t actions of their reward. Vanity, if I may u&s;e the analogy, is, with re&s;pect to the other vices, what feeling is in regard to the other &s;en&s;es; it is not confined in its operation to the eye, or the ear, or any &s;ingle organ, but diffu&s;ed through the whole being, alive in every part, awakened and communicated by the &s;lighte&s;t touch.</P>
<P>Not a few of the evils of the pre&s;ent day ari&s;e from a new and perverted application of terms; among the&s;e, perhaps, there is not one more abu&s;|ed, mi&s;under&s;tood, or mi&s;applied, than the term <HI>accompli&s;hments.</HI> This word in its original meaning, &s;ignifies <HI>completene&s;s, perfection.</HI> But I may &s;afely appeal to the ob&s;ervation of mankind, whether they do not meet with &s;warms of youthful females, i&s;&s;u|ing from our boarding &s;chools, as well as emerging from the more private &s;cenes of dome&s;tic education, who are introduced into the world, under the broad
<PB N="64" REF="037996_0063_100FA9A4B22E4C58">
and univer&s;al title of <HI>accompli&s;hed young ladies,</HI> of <HI>all</HI> of whom it cannot very truly and correctly be pro|nounced, that they illu&s;trate the definition by a com|pletene&s;s which leaves nothing to be added, and a perfection which leaves nothing to be de&s;ired.</P>
<P>This phrenzy of accompli&s;hments, unhappily, is no longer re&s;tricted within the u&s;ual limits of rank and fortune; the middle orders have caught the contagion, and it rages downward with increa&s;ing violence, from the elegantly dre&s;&s;ed but &s;lenderly portioned curate's daughter, to the equally fa&s;hiona|ble daughter of the little trade&s;man, and of the more opulent but not more judicious farmer. And is it not obvious, that as far as this epidemical mania has &s;pread, this very valuable part of &s;ociety is declining in u&s;efulne&s;s, as it ri&s;es in its unlucky preten&s;ions to elegance? And this revolution of the manners of the middle cla&s;s has &s;o far altered the character of the age, as to be in danger of rendering ob&s;olete the heretofore common &s;aying, <Q>that mo&s;t worth and virtue are to be found in the middle &s;tation.</Q> For I do not &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ert, that in general, as as far as my little ob&s;ervation has extended, this cla&s;s of females, in what relates both to religious know|ledge and to practical indu&s;try, falls &s;hort both of the very high and the very low. Their new cour&s;e of education, and the habits of life and elegance of dre&s;s connected with it, peculiarly unfits them for
<PB N="65" REF="037996_0064_100FA9A790D12530">
the active duties of their own very important condi|tion; while, with frivolous eagerne&s;s and &s;econd|hand opportunities, they run to &s;natch a few of tho&s;e &s;howy acquirements which decorate the great. This is done apparently with one or other of the&s;e views; either to make their fortune by marriage, or if that fail, to qualify them to become teachers of others: hence the abundant multiplication of &s;uper|ficial wives, and of incompetent and illiterate go|verne&s;&s;es. The u&s;e of the pencil, the performance of exqui&s;ite but unnece&s;&s;ary works, the &s;tudy of foreign languages and of mu&s;ic, require (with &s;ome exceptions which &s;hould always be made in favour of great natural genius) a degree of lei&s;ure which belongs exclu&s;ively to affluence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e among the cla&s;s in que&s;tion, who&s;e own good &s;en&s;e leads them to avoid the&s;e mi&s;taken pur&s;uits, cannot be offended at a reproof which does not belong to them.</NOTE> One u&s;e of learn|ing languages is, not that we may know what the terms which expre&s;s the articles of our dre&s;s and our table are called in French or Italian; not that we may think over a few ordinary phra&s;es in Engli&s;h, and then tran&s;late them, without one foreign idiom; for he who cannot <HI>think</HI> in a language cannot be &s;aid to under&s;tand it: but the great u&s;e of acquiring any foreign language is, either that it enables us occa&s;i|onally to conver&s;e with foreigners unacquainted with any other, or that it is a key to the literature of the
<PB N="66" REF="037996_0065_100FA9ABA9703338">
country to which it belongs; and tho&s;e humbler fe|males, the chief part of who&s;e time is required for dome&s;tic offices, are little likely to fall in the way of foreigners; and &s;o far from enjoying opportunities for the acqui&s;ition of foreign literature, they have &s;eldom time to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of all that valuable knowledge which the books of their own country &s;o abundantly furni&s;h; and the acqui&s;ition of which would be &s;o much more u&s;eful and honourable than the paltry acce&s;&s;ions they make, by hammering out the meaning of a few pa&s;&s;ages in a tongue they but imperfectly under&s;tand, and of which they are like|ly to make no u&s;e.</P>
<P>It would be well if the reflection how eagerly this redundancy of accompli&s;hments is &s;eized on by their inferiors, were to operate as in the ca&s;e of other ab&s;urd fa&s;hions, which the great can &s;eldom be brought to renounce from any other con&s;ideration than that they are adopted by the vulgar.</P>
<P>But, to return to that more elevated, and, on ac|count of their more extended influence only, that more important cla&s;s of females, to who&s;e u&s;e this little work is more immediately dedicated. Some popular authors, on the &s;ubject of female in&s;truc|tion, had for a time e&s;tabli&s;hed a fanta&s;tic code of artificial manners. They had refined elegance into in&s;ipidity, frittered down delicacy into frivolou&s;ne&s;s, and reduced manner into <HI>minauderie.</HI> But <Q>to li&s;p,
<PB N="67" REF="037996_0066_100FA9AE44A2A540">
and to amble, and to nick-name God's creatures,</Q> has nothing to do with true gentlene&s;s of mind; and to be &s;illy makes no nece&s;&s;ary part of &s;oftne&s;s. Another cla&s;s of cotemporary authors turned all the force of their talents to excite <HI>emotions,</HI> to in&s;pire <HI>&s;en|timent,</HI> and to reduce all mental and moral excel|lence into <HI>&s;ympathy</HI> and <HI>feeling.</HI> The&s;e &s;ofter quali|ties were elevated at the expence of principle; and young women were ince&s;&s;antly hearing unqualified &s;en&s;ibility extolled as the perfection of their nature; till tho&s;e who really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this amiable quality, in&s;tead of directing, and cha&s;ti&s;ing, and re&s;training it, were in danger of fo&s;tering it to their hurt, and began to con&s;ider them&s;elves as deriving their excel|lence from its exce&s;s; while tho&s;e le&s;s intere&s;ting dam&s;els, who happened not to find any of this ami|able &s;en&s;ibility in their <HI>hearts,</HI> but thought it credi|table to have it &s;omewhere, fancied its &s;eat was in the <HI>nerves;</HI> and here indeed it was ea&s;ily found or feigned; till a fal&s;e and exce&s;&s;ive di&s;play of feeling became &s;o predominant, as to bring in que&s;tion the actual exi&s;tence of that true tenderne&s;s, without which, though a woman may be worthy, &s;he can never be amiable.</P>
<P>Fa&s;hion then, by one of her &s;udden and rapid turns, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;truck out real &s;en&s;ibility and the affectation of it from the &s;tanding li&s;t of female perfections; and, by a quick touch of her magic

The&s;e &s;elf-complacent heroines made us ready to regret their &s;ofter predece&s;&s;ors, who had aimed only at plea&s;ing the other &s;ex, while the&s;e a&s;piring fair ones &s;truggled for the bolder re|nown of rivalling them; the project failed; for, whereas the former had &s;ued for admiration, the lat|ter challenged, &s;eized, compelled it; but the men, as was natural, continued to prefer the more mode&s;t claimant to the &s;turdy competitor.</P>
<P>It were well if we, who have the advantage of contemplating the errors of the two extremes, were to look for truth where &s;he is commonly to be found, in the plain and obvious middle path, equal|ly remote from each exce&s;s; and, while we bear in mind that helple&s;&s;ne&s;s is not delicacy, let us al&s;o re|member that ma&s;culine manners do not nece&s;&s;arily in|clude &s;trength of character nor vigour of intellect.

Before the evil is pa&s;t redre&s;s, it will be prudent to reflect that in all poli&s;hed countries an entire devotedne&s;s to the fine arts has been one grand &s;ource of the corruption of the women; and &s;o ju&s;tly were the&s;e pernicious con&s;equences appreciated by the Greeks, among whom the&s;e arts were carried to the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible perfection, that they &s;eldom al|lowed them to be cultivated to a very exqui&s;ite de|gree by women of great purity of character. And if the ambition of an elegant Briti&s;h lady &s;hould be fired by the idea that the accompli&s;hed females of tho&s;e poli&s;hed &s;tates were the admired companions of the philo&s;ophers, the poets, the wits, and the arti&s;ts of Athens; and their beauty or talents the favourite &s;ubjects of the mu&s;e, the lyre, the pencil, and the chi&s;&s;el; &s;o that their pictures and &s;tatues furni&s;hed the mo&s;t con&s;ummate models of Grecian art: if, I &s;ay, the accompli&s;hed females of our days are pant|ing for &s;imilar renown, let their mode&s;ty cha&s;ti&s;e their ambition, by recollecting that the&s;e celebrated women are not to be found among the cha&s;te wives and the

I am per&s;uaded the Chri&s;tian female, whatever be her talents, will renounce the de&s;ire of any celebrity when attached to impurity of charac|ter, with the &s;ame noble indignation with which the virtuous biographer of the above-named heroes re|nounced all di&s;hone&s;t fame, by exclaiming, <Q>I had rather it &s;hould be &s;aid there never was a Plutarch, than that they &s;hould &s;ay Plutarch was malignant, unju&s;t, or envious.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No cen&s;ure is levelled at the exertions of real genius, which is as valuable as it is rare; but at the ab&s;urdity of that &s;y&s;tem which is erecting <HI>the whole &s;ex</HI> into arti&s;ts.</NOTE></Q></P>

<P>Let me not however be mi&s;under&s;tood. The cu&s;toms which fa&s;hion has e&s;tabli&s;hed, when not in direct oppo&s;ition to what is right, &s;hould unque&s;|tionably be pur&s;ued in the education of ladies. Piety maintains no natural war with elegance, and Chri&s;|tianity would be no gainer by making her di&s;ciples unamiable. Religion does not forbid that the ex|terior be made to a certain degree the object of at|tention. But the admiration be&s;towed, the &s;ums expended, and the time lavi&s;hed on arts which add little to the intrin&s;ic value of life, &s;hould have limita|tions. While the&s;e arts &s;hould be admired, let them not be admired above their ju&s;t value: while they are practi&s;ed, let it not be to the exclu&s;ion of higher employments: while they are cultivated, let it be to amu&s;e lei&s;ure, but not to engro&s;s life.</P>
<P>But it happens unfortunately, that to ordinary ob|&s;ervers, the girl who is really receiving the wor&s;t education often makes the be&s;t figure. The outward
<PB N="78" REF="037996_0077_100FA9C8C4964D18">
accompli&s;hments have the dangerous advantage of addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves more immediately to the &s;en&s;es, and of cour&s;e meet every where with tho&s;e who can in &s;ome mea&s;ure appreciate as well as admire them; for all can &s;ee and hear, but all cannot &s;crutinize and di&s;criminate. External acquirements, too recommend them&s;elves the more becau&s;e they are more rapidly as well as more vi&s;ibly progre&s;&s;ive. While the mind is led on to improvement by &s;low motions and im|perceptible degrees; while the heart mu&s;t now be admoni&s;hed by reproof, and now allured by kind|ne&s;s; its livelie&s;t advances being &s;uddenly impeded by ob&s;tinacy, and its brighte&s;t pro&s;pects often ob|&s;cured by pa&s;&s;ion; it is &s;low in its acqui&s;itions of vir|tue, and reluctant in its approaches to piety. The unruly and turbulent propen&s;ities of the mind are not &s;o obedient to the forming hand as defects of manner or awkwardne&s;s of gait. Often when we fancy that a trouble&s;ome pa&s;&s;ion is completely cru&s;h|ed, we have the mortification to find that we have "&s;cotch'd" the &s;nake, not killed it."

But parents, who are the lords of the &s;oil, mu&s;t look to permanent value, and to continued fruitfulne&s;s.

her improvements in the mo&s;t immediate and con|&s;picuous point of view. To attract admiration is the great principle &s;edulou&s;ly inculcated into her young heart; and is con&s;idered as the fundamental maxim; and, perhaps, if we were required to con|den&s;e the reigning &s;y&s;tem of the brilliant education of a lady into an aphori&s;m, it might be compri&s;ed in this &s;hort &s;entence, <HI>To allure and to &s;hine.</HI> This &s;y&s;|tem however is the fruitful germ, from which a thou|&s;and yet unborn vanities, with all their multiplied ramifications will &s;pring.

<P><Q>To every thing there is a &s;ea&s;on, and a time for every purpo&s;e under heaven,</Q> &s;aid the wi&s;e man; but he &s;aid it before the invention of baby-balls.

To &s;acrifice the true and proper enjoyments of &s;prightly and happy children, is to make them pay a dear and di&s;proportionate price for their artificial plea&s;ures. They &s;tep at once from the nur&s;ery to the ball-room; and, by a prepo&s;terous change of habits, are thinking of dre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, at an age when they u&s;ed to be dre&s;&s;ing their dolls.

The true plea&s;ures of child|hood are cheap and natural; for every object teems with delight to eyes and hearts new to the enjoyment of life; nay, the hearts of healthy children abound with a general di&s;po&s;ition to mirth and joyfulne&s;s, even without a &s;pecific object to excite it; like our fir&s;t parent, in the world's fir&s;t &s;pring, when all was new, and fre&s;h, and gay about him,

Only furni&s;h them with a few &s;imple and harmle&s;s materials, and a little, but not too much, lei&s;ure, and they will manufacture their own plea&s;ures with more &s;kill, and &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;atisfaction, than they will receive from all that your money can purcha&s;e.

want of firmne&s;s to re&s;i&s;t the tyranny of fa&s;hion, &s;ometimes fallen.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Compari&s;on of the mode of female education in the la&s;t age with the pre&s;ent.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>To return, however, to the &s;ubject of general edu|cation. A young lady may excel in &s;peaking French and Italian, may repeat a few pa&s;&s;ages from a volume of extracts; play like a profe&s;&s;or, and &s;ing like a &s;y|ren; have her dre&s;&s;ing room decorated with her own drawings, tables, &s;tands, &s;creens, and cabinets; nay, &s;he may dance like Sempronia* her&s;elf, and yet may have been very badly educated. I am far from meaning to &s;et no value whatever on any or all of the&s;e qualifications; they are all of them elegant, and many of them properly tend to the perfecting of a polite education. The&s;e things in their mea&s;ure and degree, may be done, but there are others which &s;hould not be left undone. Many things are becom|ing, but "one thing is needful." Be&s;ides, as the world &s;eems to be fully apprized of the value of whatever tends to embelli&s;h life, there is le&s;s occa|&s;ion here to in&s;i&s;t on its importance.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="037996_0088_100FA9E729C2D778">
But, though a well-bred young lady may lawfully learn mo&s;t of the fa&s;hionable arts, yet it does not &s;eem to be the true end of education to make women of fa&s;hion <HI>dancers, &s;ingers, players, painters, actre&s;&s;es, &s;culptors, gilders, varni&s;hers, engravers,</HI> and <HI>embroi|derers.</HI> Mo&s;t <HI>men</HI> are commonly de&s;tined to &s;ome profe&s;&s;ion, and their minds are con&s;equently turned each to its re&s;pective object. Would it not be &s;trange if they were called out to exerci&s;e their profe&s;&s;ion, or to &s;et up their trade, with only a little general knowledge of the trades of all other men, and with|out any previous definite application to their own peculiar calling? The profe&s;&s;ion of ladies, to which the bent of <HI>their</HI> in&s;truction &s;hould be turned, is that of daughters, wives, mothers, and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of families. They &s;hould be therefore trained with a view to the&s;e &s;everal conditions, and be furni&s;hed with a &s;tock of ideas, and principles, and qualifica|tions, and habits, ready to be applied and appropri|ated, as occa&s;ion may demand, to each of the&s;e re|&s;pective &s;ituations: for though the arts which merely embelli&s;h life mu&s;t claim admiration; yet when a man of &s;en&s;e comes to marry, it is a companion whom he wants, and not an arti&s;t. It is not merely a creature who can paint, and play, and dre&s;s, and dance; it is a being who can comfort and coun&s;el him; one who can rea&s;on, and reflect, and feel, and judge, and act, and di&s;cour&s;e, and di&s;criminate; one

who can a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his affairs, lighten his cares, &s;oothed his &s;orrows, purify his joys, &s;trengthen his principles, and educate his children.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t any ornamental talent is a good thing, when it is not the be&s;t thing a woman has; and talents are admirable when not made to &s;tand proxy for virtues. The writer of the&s;e pages is intimately acquainted with &s;everal ladies who, excelling mo&s;t of their &s;ex in the art of mu&s;ic, but excelling them al&s;o in prudence and piety, find little lei&s;ure or temp|tation, amid&s;t the delights and duties of a large and lovely family, for the exerci&s;e of this talent, and re|gret that &s;o much of their own youth was wa&s;ted in acquiring an art which can be turned to &s;o little ac|count in married life; and are now con&s;cientiou&s;ly re&s;tricting their daughters in the portion of time al|lotted to its acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to di&s;courage the cultivation of any exi&s;ting talent; but may it not be &s;ugge&s;ted to the fond believing mother, that talents, like the &s;pirit of Owen Glendower, though conjured by parental partiality with ever &s;o loud a voice,
<Q><L>Yet will not come when you do call for them?</L></Q></P>
<P>That injudicious practice, therefore, cannot be too much di&s;couraged, of endeavouring to create talents which do not exi&s;t in nature. <HI>That their daughters &s;hall learn every thing,</HI> is &s;o general a maternal maxim, that even unborn daughters, of who&s;e ex|pected

abilities and conjectured faculties, it is pre|&s;umed, no very accurate judgment can previou&s;ly be formed, are yet prede&s;tined to this univer&s;ality of accompli&s;hments. This comprehen&s;ive maxim&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> almo&s;t univer&s;ally brought into practice, at once weakens the general powers of the mind, by draw|ing off its &s;trength into too great a variety of direc|tions; and cuts up time into too many portions, by &s;plitting it into &s;uch an endle&s;s multiplicity of em|ployments. I know that I am treading on tender ground; but I cannot help thinking that the re&s;tle&s;s pains we take to cram up every little vacuity of life, by crowding one new thing upon another, rather creates a thir&s;t for novelty than knowledge; and is but a well-di&s;gui&s;ed contrivance to keep us in after|life more effectually from conver&s;ing with our&s;elves. The care taken to prevent <HI>ennui</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> but a creditable plan for promoting &s;elf-ignorance. We run from one occupation to another (I &s;peak of tho&s;e arts to which little intellect is applied) with a view to lighten the pre&s;&s;ure of time; above all, we fly to them to &s;ave us from our own thoughts; whereas were we thrown a little more on our own hands, we might at la&s;t be driven, by way of &s;omething to do, to try to get acquainted with our own hearts; and though our being le&s;s ab&s;orbed by this bu&s;y trifling, which dignifies its inanity with the impo&s;ing name of occu|pation, might render us &s;omewhat more &s;en&s;ible of

the tedium of life; might not this very &s;en&s;ation tend to quicken our pur&s;uit of a better? For an awful thought here &s;ugge&s;ts it&s;elf.

Let not then the &s;oul be &s;tarved by feeding it on the&s;e empty hu&s;ks, for it can be no more nouri&s;hed by them than the body can be fed with ideas and prin|ciples.</P>
<P>Among the boa&s;ted improvements of the pre&s;ent age, none affords more frequent matter of peculiar exultation, than the manife&s;t &s;uperiority in the employments of the young ladies of our time over tho&s;e of the good hou&s;ewives of the la&s;t century. They glory that they are at pre&s;ent employed in learn|ing the polite arts, or in acquiring liberal accompli&s;h|ments; while the others wore out their joyle&s;s days in adorning the man&s;ion-hou&s;e with hangings of hide|ous tape&s;try and disfiguring tent-&s;titch. Mo&s;t cheer|fully do I allow to the reigning modes their boa&s;ted &s;uperiority; for certainly there is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> piety in bad ta&s;te. Still, granting all the deformity of the ex|ploded ornaments, one advantage attended them: the walls and floors were not vain of their decorati|ons; and it is to be feared, that the little per&s;on
<PB N="93" REF="037996_0092_100FA9EBCD848A70">
&s;ometimes is. The flattery be&s;towed on the ob&s;olete employments, for probably even <HI>they</HI> had their flat|terers, furni&s;hed le&s;s aliment and le&s;s gratification to vanity, and was le&s;s likely to impair the delicacy of mode&s;ty, than the exqui&s;ite cultivation of <HI>per&s;onal</HI> accompli&s;hments or per&s;onal decorations; and every mode which keeps down vanity and keeps back <HI>&s;elf,</HI> has at lea&s;t a moral u&s;e. And while one admires the elegant fingers of a young lady, bu&s;ied in work|ing or painting her ball dre&s;s, one cannot help &s;u&s;|pecting that her alacrity may be a little &s;timulated by the animating idea <HI>how very well &s;he &s;hall look in it.</HI> Nor was the indu&s;trious matron of Ithaca more &s;oothed at her &s;olitary loom with the &s;weet reflection that by her labour &s;he was gratifying her filial and conjugal feelings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This web a robe for poor Uly&s;&s;es' fire,</NOTE>, than the plea&s;ure-loving dam&s;el, by the anticipated admiration which her ingenuity is procuring for her beauty.</P>
<P>Might not this propen&s;ity be a little checked, and an intere&s;ting feeling combined with her indu&s;try, were the fair arti&s;t habituated to exerci&s;e her &s;kill in adorning &s;ome one el&s;e rather than her&s;elf? For it will add no lightne&s;s to the lighte&s;t head, nor vanity to the vaine&s;t heart, to take plea&s;ure in reflecting how exceedingly the gown &s;he is working will become
<PB N="94" REF="037996_0093_100FA9EF740732D8">
her mother. This &s;ugge&s;tion, trifling as it may &s;eem, of habituating young ladies to exerci&s;e their ta&s;te and devote their lei&s;ure, not to the decoration of their own per&s;ons, but to the &s;ervice of tho&s;e to whom they are bound by every tender tie, would not only help to repre&s;s vanity, but by thus a&s;&s;ociat|ing the idea of indu&s;try with that of filial affection, would promote, while it gratified, &s;ome of the be&s;t affections of the heart. The Romans (and it is mor|tifying on the &s;ubject of Chri&s;tian education to be driven &s;o often to refer to the &s;uperiority of Pagans) were &s;o well aware of the importance of keeping up a &s;en&s;e of family fondne&s;s and attachment by the very &s;ame means which promoted &s;imple and dome&s;tic employment, that no citizen of note ever appeared in public in any garb but what was &s;pun by his wife and daughter; and this virtuous fa&s;hion was not con|fined to the days of republican &s;everity, but even in all the pomp and luxury of imperial power, Augu&s;tus pre&s;erved in his own family this &s;implicity of man|ners.</P>
<P>Let me be allowed to repeat, that I mean not with prepo&s;terous prai&s;e to de&s;cant on the ignorance or the prejudices of pa&s;t times, nor ab&s;urdly to regret that vulgar &s;y&s;tem of education which rounded the little circle of female acquirements within the limits of the &s;ampler and the receipt book.

u&s;eful, a preference almo&s;t exclu&s;ive al&s;o is now a&s;|&s;igned to what is merely ornamental. And it mu&s;t be owned, that if the life of a young lady, formerly, too much re&s;embled the life of a confectioner, it now too much re&s;embles that of an actre&s;s; the morning is all rehear&s;al, and the evening is all performance: and tho&s;e who are trained in this regular routine, who are in&s;tructed in order to be exhibited, &s;oon learn to feel <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of impatience in tho&s;e &s;ocieties in which <HI>their</HI> kind of talents are not likely to be brought into play: the ta&s;k of an auditor becomes dull to her who has been u&s;ed to be a performer. E&s;teem and kindne&s;s become but cold &s;ub&s;titutes to her who has been fed with plaudits and acclamati|ons. And the exce&s;&s;ive commendation which the vi&s;itor is expected to pay for his entertainment not only keeps alive the flame of vanity in the arti&s;t by con&s;tant fuel, but is not &s;eldom exacted at a price which a veracity at all &s;trict would grudge; but when a whole circle are obliged to be competitors who &s;hall flatter mo&s;t, it is not ea&s;y to be at once very &s;incere and very civil.

<P>May I venture, without being accu&s;ed of pedantry, to conclude this chapter with another reference to Pagan examples?

<P>THERE are many well-di&s;po&s;ed parents who, while they attend to the&s;e fa&s;hionable acquirements, do not neglect to infu&s;e religious knowledge into the minds of their daughters; and having done this are but too apt to conclude that they have fully acquitted them|&s;elves of the important duties of education. For having, as they think, &s;ufficiently grounded them in religion they do not &s;cruple to allow their daugh|ters to &s;pend almo&s;t the whole of their time exactly like the daughters of worldly people. Now, though it be one great point gained, to have imbued their young minds with the be&s;t knowledge, the work is not therefore accompli&s;hed.

<P><HI>They</HI> &s;hould be more peculiarly on their guard again&s;t a &s;pirit of idlene&s;s, and a &s;lovenly habitual wa&s;ting of time, becau&s;e this practice, by not a&s;&s;um|ing a palpable &s;hape of guilt, carries little alarm to the con&s;cience. Even religious characters are in dan|ger on this &s;ide; for not allowing them&s;elves to fol|low the world in its exce&s;&s;es and diver&s;ions, they have con&s;equently more time upon their hands; and in&s;tead of dedicating the time &s;o re&s;cued to its true purpo&s;es, they &s;ometimes make as it were compen&s;a|tion to them&s;elves for their ab&s;tinence from danger|ous places of public re&s;ort, by an habitual frivolou&s;ne&s;s at home; by a &s;uperabundance of unprofitable &s;mall-talk, idle reading, and a quiet and dull fritter|ing away of time. Their day perhaps has been more free from actual evil; but it will often be found to have been as unproductive as that of more world|ly characters; and they will be found to have trad|ed to as little purpo&s;e with their ma&s;ter's talents.

Ill-judging tenderne&s;s is in fact only a concealed &s;elf-love, which cannot bear to be witne&s;s to the unea&s;ine&s;s which a pre&s;ent di&s;appointment, or difficulty, or vexation, would cau&s;e to a darling child, yet does not &s;cruple by impro|per gratification to &s;tore up for it future mi&s;eries, which the child will infallibly &s;uffer, though it may be at a di&s;tant period which the mother will be &s;aved the pain of beholding.</P>
<P>Another principle &s;omething different from this, though it may properly fall under the head of &s;elf|i&s;hne&s;s, &s;eems to actuate &s;ome parents in their con|duct towards their children: I mean, a certain &s;loth|fulne&s;s of mind, a love of ea&s;e, which impo&s;es a voluntary blindne&s;s, and makes them not choo&s;e to &s;ee what will give them trouble to combat. From &s;uch per&s;ons we frequently hear &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e: "Children will be children:"&mdash;"My chil|dren I &s;uppo&s;e are much like tho&s;e of other peo|ple," &amp;c. Thus we may ob&s;erve this dangerous and delu&s;ive principle frequently turning off with a &s;mile from the fir&s;t indications of tho&s;e tempers, which from their fatal tendency ought to be very &s;eriou&s;ly taken up. I would be under&s;tood now as &s;peaking to con&s;cientious parents, who con&s;ider it as a duty to correct the faults of their children, but who, from this indolence of mind, are extreme|ly backward in <HI>di&s;covering</HI> &s;uch faults, and not very

well plea&s;ed when they are pointed out by others. Such parents will do well to take notice that what|ever they con&s;ider it as a duty to <HI>correct,</HI> mu&s;t be equally a duty to endeavour to <HI>find out.</HI> And this love of ea&s;e is the more to be guarded again&s;t, as it not only leads parents into erroneous conduct to|wards their children, but is peculiarly dangerous to them&s;elves. It is a fault frequently cheri&s;hed from ignorance of its real character; for, not bear|ing on it the &s;trong features of deformity which mark many other vices, but on the contrary bear|ing &s;ome re&s;emblance to virtue, it is frequently mi&s;|taken for the Chri&s;tian graces of patience, meek|ne&s;s, and forbearance, than which nothing can be more oppo&s;ite; the&s;e proceeding from the Chri&s;tian principle of &s;elf-denial, the other from &s;elf-indul|gence.</P>
<P>In this connection may I be permitted to remark on the practice at the tables of many families, when the children are at home for the holidays; every delicacy is forced upon them, with the tempting re|mark, "that they cannot have this or that dainty at &s;chool;" and they are indulged in irregular hours for the &s;ame motive, "becau&s;e they cannot have that indulgence at &s;chool." Thus the natural &s;eeds of idlene&s;s, &s;en&s;uality, and &s;loth, are at once che|ri&s;hed, by converting the periodical vi&s;it at home into a &s;ea&s;on of intemperance, late hours, and exemption

from &s;tudy; &s;o that children are habituated, at an age when la&s;ting a&s;&s;ociations are formed in the mind, to connect the idea of &s;tudy with that of hard&s;hip, of happine&s;s with gluttony, and of plea&s;ure with loitering, fea&s;ting, or &s;leeping. Would it not be better to make them combine the delightful idea of home, with the gratification of the &s;ocial affections, the fondne&s;s of maternal love, the kindne&s;s and warmth and confidence of the &s;weet dome&s;tic attach|ments,

<P>In what relates to pecuniary bounty, it will be requiring of children a very &s;mall &s;acrifice, if you teach them merely to give that money to the poor which properly belongs to the parent; this &s;ort of charity commonly &s;ubtracts little from their own plea&s;ures, e&s;pecially when what they have be&s;towed is immediately made up to them, as a reward for their little fit of genero&s;ity. They will, on this plan, &s;oon learn to give, not only for prai&s;e but for profit. The &s;acrifice of an orange to a little girl, or a feather to a great one, given at the expence of their own gratification, would be a better le&s;&s;on of charity on its right ground, than a con&s;iderable &s;um of money to be pre&s;ently replaced by the parent.

As an antidote to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, as well as pride and indolence, they &s;hould al&s;o very early be taught to perform all the little offices in their power for them|&s;elves; not to be in&s;olently calling for &s;ervants where there is no real occa&s;ion; above all, they &s;hould be accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider the dome&s;tics' hours of meals and re&s;t as almo&s;t &s;acred, and the golden rule &s;hould be practically and uniformly enforced, even on &s;o trifling an occa&s;ion as ringing a bell through mere wantonne&s;s, or &s;elf-love, or pride.</P>
<P>To check the growth of incon&s;ideratene&s;s, young ladies &s;hould early be taught to di&s;charge their little debts with punctuality.

to bring the gown home fini&s;hed on the Monday morning, on pain of her di&s;plea&s;ure. To the&s;e hard|&s;hips numbers are continually driven by good-natured but incon&s;iderate employers.

<P>It can never be too often repeated, that one of the great objects of education is the forming of habits. Among the in&s;tances of negligence into which even religiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed parents and teachers are apt to fall, one is, that they are not &s;ufficiently attentive in finding intere&s;ting employment for the Sunday. They do not make a &s;cruple of &s;ometimes allowing their children to fill up the intervals of public wor&s;hip with their ordinary employments and
<PB N="109" REF="037996_0108_100F7C642FD3D1F8">
common &s;chool exerci&s;es. They are not aware that they are thus training their offspring to an early and a &s;y&s;tematic profanation of the Sabbath by this ha|bit; for to children, their ta&s;ks are their bu&s;ine&s;s; to them a French or Latin exerci&s;e is as &s;erious an occupation as the exerci&s;e of a trade or profe&s;&s;ion is to a man; and if they are allowed to think the one right <HI>now,</HI> they will not be brought hereafter to think that the other is wrong; for the opinions and prac|tices fixed at this early &s;ea&s;on are not ea&s;ily altered. By this over&s;ight even the friends of religion may be contributing eventually to that abolition of the Sab|bath, &s;o devoutedly wi&s;hed by its enemies, as the de&s;ired preliminary to the de&s;truction of whatever is mo&s;t dear to Chri&s;tians. What ob&s;truction would it offer to the general progre&s;s of youth, if all their Sunday exerci&s;es (which, with reading, compo&s;ing, tran&s;cribing, and getting by heart, might be extended to an entertaining variety) were ad|apted to the peculiar nature of the day? It is not meant to impo&s;e on them &s;uch rigorous &s;tudy as &s;hall convert the day they &s;hould be taught to love into a day of burdens and hard&s;hips, or to abridge their innocent enjoyments; but it is intended merely to &s;ugge&s;t that there &s;hould be a marked di&s;tinction in the nature of their employments and &s;tudies; for on the ob&s;ervance or neglect of this, as was before ob&s;erved, their future notions and principles will in

a good degree be formed. The go&s;pel, in re&s;cuing the Lord's day from the rigorous bondage of the Jewi&s;h Sabbath, never le&s;&s;ened the obligation to keep it holy, nor meant to &s;anction any &s;ecular occupa|tion.</P>

Even in tho&s;e &s;chools, in which religion is con&s;idered as an indi&s;|pen&s;able part of in&s;truction, this kind of in&s;truction is almo&s;t exclu&s;ively limited to Sundays: how then are girls ever to make any progre&s;s in this mo&s;t im|portant article, if they are habituated to lo&s;e the re|ligious advantages of the &s;chool, for the &s;ake of hav|ing more dainties for dinner abroad?

Among other &s;ubjects which engro&s;s a good &s;hare of worldly conver&s;ation, one of the mo&s;t attracting is beauty. Many ladies have often a random way of talking rapturou&s;ly on the general importance of beauty, who are yet prudent enough to be very un|willing to let their own daughters find out they are hand&s;ome. Perhaps the contrary cour&s;e might be &s;afer. If the little li&s;tener were not con&s;tantly hear|ing that beauty is the be&s;t gift, &s;he would not be &s;o vain from fancying her&s;elf to be the be&s;t gifted. Be le&s;s &s;olicitous, therefore, to conceal from her a &s;ecret which with all your watchfulne&s;s &s;he will be &s;ure to find out, without your telling; but rather &s;eek to lower the general value of beauty in her e&s;timation. U&s;e your daughter in all things to a different &s;tand|ard from that of the world. It is not by vulgar people and &s;ervants only that &s;he will be told of her being pretty. She will be hearing it not only from gay ladies, but from grave men; &s;he will be hear|ing it from the whole world around her. The an|tidote to the pre&s;ent danger is not now to be &s;earch|ed for; it mu&s;t be already operating; it mu&s;t have been provided for in the foundation laid in the gene|ral principle &s;he had been imbibing, before this par|ticular temptation of beauty came in que&s;tion. And this general principle is an habitual indifference to flattery. She mu&s;t have learnt not to be intoxicated by the prai&s;e of the world. She mu&s;t have learnt to
<PB N="112" REF="037996_0111_100FAA1F5B1A1088">
e&s;timate things by their intrin&s;ic worth, rather than by the world's e&s;timation. Speak to her with parti|cular kindne&s;s and commendation of plain but amia|ble girls; mention with compa&s;&s;ion &s;uch as are hand|&s;ome but ill-educated; &s;peak ca&s;ually of &s;ome who were once thought pretty, but have cea&s;ed to be good; make u&s;e of the &s;hortne&s;s and uncertainty of beauty, as &s;trong additional rea&s;ons for making that which is little valuable in it&s;elf, &s;till le&s;s valuable. As it is a <HI>new</HI> idea which is always dangerous, you may thus break the force of this danger by allow|ing her an early introduction to this inevitable know|ledge, which would become more intere&s;ting, and of cour&s;e more perilous by every additional year: and if you can guard again&s;t that fatal error of letting her &s;ee that &s;he is more loved on account of her beauty, her familiarity with the idea may be le&s;s than its novelty afterwards would prove.</P>
<P>But the great and con&s;tant danger to which young per&s;ons in the higher walks of life are expo&s;ed, is the prevailing turn and &s;pirit of general conver&s;a|tion. Even the children of better families, who are well in&s;tructed when at their &s;tudies, are yet at other times continually beholding the WORLD &s;et up in the highe&s;t and mo&s;t advantageous point of view. Seeing the world! knowing the world! &s;tanding well with the world! making a figure in the world! is &s;poken of as including the whole &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of hu|man

advantages. They hear their education almo&s;t exclu&s;ively alluded to with reference to the <HI>figure</HI> it will enable them to make in the world. In almo&s;t all companies, they hear all that the world admires &s;poken of with admiration; rank flattered, fame co|veted, power &s;ought, beauty idolized, money con|&s;idered as the one thing needful, and as the atoning &s;ub&s;titute for the want of all other things; profit held up as the reward of virtue, and worldly e&s;tima|tion as the ju&s;t and highe&s;t prize of lawful ambition; and after the very &s;pirit of the world has been thus habitually infu&s;ed into them all the week, one cannot expect much effect from their being coldly told now and then on Sundays, that they mu&s;t not "love the world, nor the things of the world." To tell them once in &s;even days that it is a &s;in to gratify an appetite which you have been whetting and &s;timulat|ing the preceding &s;ix, is to require from them a pow|er of &s;elf-control, which our knowledge of the im|petuo&s;ity of the pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;pecially in early age, &s;hould have taught us is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>This is not the place to animadvert on the u&s;ual mi&s;application of the phra&s;e, "knowing the world;" which term is commonly applied, in the way of pane|gyric, to keen, de&s;igning, &s;elfi&s;h, ambitious men, who &s;tudy mankind in order to turn it to their own ac|count.

<P>This revolutionary &s;pirit in families &s;ugge&s;ts the remark, that among the faults with which it has been too much the fa&s;hion of recent times to load the memory of the incomparable Milton, one of the charges brought again&s;t his private character (for with his political character we have here nothing to do) has been, that he was &s;o &s;evere a father as to have compelled his daughters, after he was blind, to read aloud to him, for his &s;ole plea&s;ure, Greek and Latin authors of which they did not under&s;tand a word. But this is in fact nothing more than an in|&s;tance of the &s;trict dome&s;tic regulations of the age in which Milton lived; and &s;hould not be brought forward as a proof of the &s;everity of his individual temper. Nor indeed in any ca&s;e &s;hould it ever be con&s;idered as an hard&s;hip for an affectionate child to amu&s;e an afflicted parent, though it &s;hould be at|tended with a heavier &s;acrifice of her own plea&s;ure than in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;pite of this too prevailing &s;pirit, numberle&s;s in&s;tances might be adduced of filial affection truly honourable to the pre&s;ent period. And the author records with plea&s;ure, that &s;he has &s;een amiable young ladies of high rank conducting the &s;teps of a blind but illu&s;|trious parent with true filial fondne&s;s; and has often contemplated, in another family, the intere&s;ting attentions of daughters who were both hands and eyes to an infirm and nearly blind father. It is but ju&s;tice to add, that the&s;e examples are not taken from that middle rank of life which Milton filled, but from the daughters of the highe&s;t officers in the &s;tate.</NOTE>.</P>

Is the author then inculcating the har&s;h doctrine of parental au&s;terity? By no means. It drives the gentle &s;pirit to artifice, and the rugged to de&s;pair. It generates deceit and cunning, the mo&s;t hopele&s;s and hateful in the whole catalogue of female failings. Ungoverned anger in the teacher, and inability to di&s;criminate between venial errors and premeditated offence, though they may lead a timid creature to hide wrong tempers, to conceal bad actions, will not help her to &s;ubdue the one or correct the other. Severity will drive terrified children to &s;eek, not for reformation, but for impunity. A readine&s;s to for|give them promotes frankne&s;s. And we &s;hould, above all things, encourage them to be frank, in or|der to come at their faults. They have not more faults for being open, they only <HI>di&s;cover</HI> more.</P>
<P>Di&s;cipline, however, is not cruelty, and re&s;traint is not &s;everity. We mu&s;t &s;trengthen the feeble, while we repel the bold. The cultivator of the human mind mu&s;t, like the gardener, &s;tudy diver&s;ities of &s;oil. The &s;kilful labourer knows that even where the &s;urface is not particularly promi&s;ing, there is often a rough &s;trong ground which will amply repay the trouble of breaking it up; yet we are often mo&s;t taken with the &s;oft &s;urface, though it conceal a &s;hal|low

depth, becau&s;e it promi&s;es pre&s;ent reward and little trouble. But &s;trong and pertinacious tempers, of which perhaps ob&s;tinacy is the leading vice, un|der &s;killful management often turn out &s;teady and &s;terling characters; while from &s;ofter clay a firm and vigorous virtue is but &s;eldom produced.</P>
<P>But the&s;e revolutions in character cannot be effect|ed by mere education. Plutarch has ob&s;erved that the medical &s;cience would never be brought to per|fection till poi&s;ons &s;hould be converted into phy&s;ic. What our late improvers in natural &s;cience have done in the medical world, by converting the mo&s;t deadly ingredients into in&s;truments of life and health, Chri&s;|tianity with a &s;ort of divine Alchymy has effected in the moral world, by that tran&s;mutation which makes tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which have been working for &s;in be|come active in the cau&s;e of religion. The violent temper of Saul of Tar&s;us which was "exceedingly mad" again&s;t the &s;aints of God, did God &s;ee fit to convert into that burning zeal which enabled Paul the Apo&s;tle to labour &s;o unremittingly for the con|ver&s;ion of the Gentile world. Chri&s;tianity indeed does not &s;o much give us new affections or faculties, as give a new direction to tho&s;e we already have. She changes that &s;orrow of the world which work|eth death, into "godly &s;orrow which worketh re|pentance." She changes our anger again&s;t the per|&s;ons we di&s;like, into hatred of their &s;ins. "The
<PB N="119" REF="037996_0118_100FAA326B6F6280">
fear of man which worketh a &s;nare," &s;he tran&s;|mutes into "that fear of God which worketh &s;alva|tion." That religion does not extingui&s;h the pa&s;|&s;ions, but alters their object, the animated expre&s;|&s;ions of the fervid Apo&s;tle confirm&mdash;<Q>Yea, what <HI>fearfulne&s;s;</HI> yea, what <HI>clearing of your&s;elves;</HI> yea, what <HI>indignation;</HI> yea, what <HI>fear;</HI> yea, what <HI>ve|hement de&s;ire;</HI> yea, what <HI>zeal;</HI> yea, what <HI>revenge!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Corinthians, vii. 11.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Thus, by &s;ome of the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome pa&s;&s;ions of our nature being converted by the ble&s;&s;ing of God on a religious education to the &s;ide of virtue, a dou|ble purpo&s;e is effected. Becau&s;e, if I may be allow|ed to change the metaphor, it is the character of the pa&s;&s;ions never to ob&s;erve a neutrality. If they are no longer rebels, they become auxiliaries; and a foe &s;ubdued is an ally obtained. And it is the effect of religion on the pa&s;&s;ions, that when &s;he &s;eizes the enemy's garri&s;on, &s;he does not de&s;troy the works, &s;he does not burn the ar&s;enal and &s;pike the cannon; but the artillery &s;he &s;eizes, &s;he turns to her own u&s;e, and plants its whole force again&s;t the enemy from whom &s;he has taken it.</P>
<P>But while I would deprecate har&s;hne&s;s, I would enforce di&s;cipline; and that not merely on the ground of religion, but of happine&s;s al&s;o. One rea&s;on not &s;eldom brought forward by tender but mi&s;taken mo|thers

as an apology for their unbounded indulgence, e&s;pecially to weakly children, is, that they probably will not live to enjoy the world when grown up, and that therefore they will not abridge the little plea&s;ure they may enjoy at pre&s;ent. But a &s;light degree of ob&s;ervation would prove that this is an error in judg|ment as well as in principle. For, omitting any con|&s;iderations re&s;pecting their future welfare, and enter|ing only into their immediate intere&s;ts; it is an indi&s;|putable fact that children who know no control, who&s;e faults encounter no contradiction, and who&s;e humours experience con&s;tant indulgence, grow more irritable and capricious, invent wants, create de&s;ires, lo&s;e all reli&s;h for the plea&s;ures which they know they may reckon upon; and become perhaps more mi&s;era|ble than even tho&s;e children who labour under the more obvious and more commi&s;erated misfortune of &s;uffering under the tyranny of unkind parents.</P>

other qualities which have more worth than &s;plen|dour. They &s;hould be led to di&s;tru&s;t their own judgment; they &s;hould learn not to murmur at ex|po&s;tulation; but &s;hould be accu&s;tomed to expect and to endure oppo&s;ition. It is a le&s;&s;on with which the world will not fail to furni&s;h them; and they will not practi&s;e it the wor&s;e for having learnt it the &s;ooner. It is of the la&s;t importance to their happi|ne&s;s in life that they &s;hould early acquire a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive temper and a forbearing &s;pirit. They mu&s;t even en|dure to be thought wrong &s;ometimes, when they cannot but feel they are right. And while they &s;hould be anxiou&s;ly a&s;piring to do well, they mu&s;t not expect always to obtain the prai&s;e of having done &s;o. But while a gentle demeanor is inculcated, let them not be in&s;tructed to practi&s;e gentlene&s;s merely on the low ground of its being decorous, and femi|nine, and plea&s;ing, and calculated to attract human favour: but let them be carefully taught to cultivate it on the high principle of obedience to Chri&s;t; on the practical ground of labouring after conformity to HIM, who, when he propo&s;ed him&s;elf as a perfect pattern of imitation, did not &s;ay, Learn of me, for I am great, or wi&s;e, or mighty, but "Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly:" and graciou&s;ly pro|mi&s;ed that the reward &s;hould accompany the practice, by encouragingly adding, "and ye &s;hall find re&s;t to your &s;ouls." Do not teach them humility on the

ordinary ground that vanity is <HI>unamiable,</HI> and that no one will <HI>love</HI> them if they are proud; for that will only go to correct the exterior, and make them &s;oft and &s;miling hypocrites. But inform them, that "God re&s;i&s;teth the proud," while <Q>them that are meek he &s;hall guide in judgment, and &s;uch as are gentle, them &s;hall he teach his way.</Q> In the&s;e, as in all other ca&s;es, an habitual attention to the <HI>motives</HI> &s;hould be carefully &s;ub&s;tituted in their young hearts, in the place of too much anxiety about the <HI>event</HI> of actions, and too much &s;olicitude for that human prai&s;e which attaches to appearances as much as to realities, to &s;ucce&s;s more than to de&s;ert.</P>
<P>Let me repeat, that it will be of va&s;t importance not to let &s;lip the earlie&s;t occa&s;ions of working gen|tle manners into an habit on their only true foun|dation, Chri&s;tian meekne&s;s.

Healing the &s;ick, feeding the multitude, re|&s;toring the blind, rai&s;ing the dead, are deeds of which we could form &s;ome adequate idea, as nece&s;&s;a|rily flowing from Almighty goodne&s;s: but to wa&s;h his di&s;ciples' feet,&mdash;to preach the go&s;pel to the <HI>poor,</HI>&mdash;to renounce not only ea&s;e, for that heroes have done on human motives,&mdash;but to renounce prai&s;e, to forgive his per&s;ecutors, to love his enemies, to pray for his murderers with his la&s;t breath;&mdash;the&s;e are things which, while they compel us to cry out with the Centurion, "Truly this was the Son of God," &s;hould remind us al&s;o, that they are not only <HI>adora|ble</HI> but <HI>imitable</HI> parts of his character.

There is a cu&s;tom among teachers, which is not the more right for being common; they are apt to be&s;tow an undue proportion of pains on children of the be&s;t capacity, as if only geniu&s;es were worthy of attention. They &s;hould reflect that in moderate ta|lents, carefully cultivated, we are perhaps to look for the chief happine&s;s and virtue of &s;ociety. If &s;uperlative genius had been generally nece&s;&s;ary, its exi&s;tence would not have been &s;o rare; for Omnipo|tence could have made tho&s;e talents common which we now con&s;ider as extraordinary. Be&s;ides, while we are con&s;cientiou&s;ly in&s;tructing children of mode|rate capacity, it is a comfort to reflect, that if no la|bour will rai&s;e them to a high degree in the &s;cale of intellectual excellence, yet they may be led on to perfection in that road in which "a way-faring man, though &s;imple, &s;hall not err." And when a mother feels di&s;po&s;ed to repine that her family is not likely to exhibit a groupe of future wits and growing beauties, let her con&s;ole her&s;elf by looking abroad into the world, where &s;he will quickly per|ceive that the monopoly of happine&s;s is not engro&s;&s;ed by beauty, nor that of virtue by genius.</P>

<P>On the other hand, is it not to be feared that &s;ome pious parents have fallen into an error of an oppo&s;ite kind? From a full conviction that human endeavours are vain, and that it is God alone who can change the heart, they are earne&s;t in their pray|ers, but not &s;o earne&s;t in their endeavours.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>As this little work by no means a&s;&s;umes the cha|racter of a general &s;cheme of education, the author has purpo&s;ely avoided expatiating largely on any kind of in&s;truction; but &s;o far as it is connected, either immediately or remotely, with objects of a moral or religious nature. Of cour&s;e &s;he has been &s;o far from thinking it nece&s;&s;ary to enter into the enumeration of tho&s;e books which are u&s;eful in general in&s;truction, that &s;he has forborne to mention any.

<P>But while due prai&s;e ought not to be withheld from the improved methods of communicating the elements of general knowledge; yet is there not &s;ome danger that our very advantages may lead us into er|ror,

by cau&s;ing us to repo&s;e &s;o confidently on the multiplied helps which facilitate the entrance into learning, as to render our pupils &s;uperficial through the very facility of acquirement? Where &s;o much is done for them, may they not be led to do too little for them&s;elves? May there not be a moral di&s;advantage in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them with the notion that learning may be acquired without diligence and labour? Sound education never <HI>can</HI> be made a "primro&s;e path of dalliance." Do what we will, we cannot <HI>cheat</HI> chil|dren into learning, or <HI>play</HI> them into knowledge, ac|cording to the &s;moothne&s;s of the modern creed. There is no idle way to any acqui&s;itions which really de&s;erve the name. And as Euclid, in order to re|pre&s;s the impetuous vanity of greatne&s;s, told his Sovereign that there was no royal way to geometry, &s;o the fond mother may be a&s;&s;ured that there is no &s;hort cut to any other kind of learning. The tree of knowledge, as a puni&s;hment, perhaps, for its ha|ving been at fir&s;t unfairly ta&s;ted, cannot now be climbed without difficulty; and this very circum|&s;tance &s;erves afterwards to furni&s;h not only literary plea&s;ures, but moral advantages: for the knowledge which is acquired by unwearied a&s;&s;iduity is la&s;ting in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;weet to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; both per|haps in proportion to the co&s;t and labour of the ac|qui&s;ition. And though an able teacher ought to en|deavour, by improving the communicating faculty in

him&s;elf, (for many know what they cannot teach,) to &s;often every difficulty; yet in &s;pite of the kind|ne&s;s and ability with which he will &s;mooth every ob|&s;truction, it is probably, among the wi&s;e in&s;titutions of Providence, that great difficulties &s;hould &s;till re|main. For education is but an initiation into that life of trial to which we are introduced on our entrance into this world. It is the fir&s;t breaking-in to that &s;tate of toil and labour to which we are born, and to which &s;in has made us liable; and in this view of the &s;ubject the acqui&s;ition of learning may be con|verted to higher u&s;es than &s;uch as are purely literary.</P>
<P>Will it not be a&s;cribed to a captious &s;ingularity if I venture to remark that real knowledge and real piety, though they may have gained in many in|&s;tances, have &s;uffered in others from that profu&s;ion of little, amu&s;ing, &s;entimental books with which the youthful library overflows? Abundance has its dan|gers as well as &s;carcity. In the fir&s;t place may not the multiplicity of the&s;e alluring little works increa&s;e the natural reluctance to tho&s;e more dry and un|intere&s;ting &s;tudies, of which, after all, the rudiments of every part of learning <HI>mu&s;t</HI> con&s;i&s;t? And, &s;econd|ly, is there not &s;ome danger (though there are many honourable exceptions) that &s;ome of tho&s;e engaging narratives may &s;erve to infu&s;e into the youthful heart a &s;ort of &s;purious goodne&s;s, a confidence of virtue, a parade of Charity? And that the benevolent actions

with the recital of which they abound, when they are not made to flow from any &s;ource but feeling, may tend to in&s;pire a &s;elf-complacency a &s;elf-gratu|lation, a "&s;tand by, for I am holier than thou?" May they not help to infu&s;e a love of popularity and an anxiety for prai&s;e, in the place of that &s;imple and uno&s;tentatious rule of doing whatever good we do, <HI>becau&s;e it is the will of God?</HI> The univer&s;al &s;ub&s;titu|tion of this principle would tend to purify the worldly morality of many a popular little &s;tory. And there are few dangers which good parents will more carefully guard again&s;t than that of giving their children a mere political piety; that &s;ort of religion which ju&s;t goes to make people more re&s;pectable, and to &s;tand well with the world; a religion which is to &s;ave appearances without inculcating realities.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An ingenious (and in many re&s;pects u&s;eful) French Treati&s;e on Education, has too much encouraged this political piety; by con&s;idering religion as a thing of human convention, rather than of divine in&s;titution; as a thing creditable, rather than command|ed; by erecting the doctrine of expediency in the place of Chri&s;tian &s;implicity; and wearing away the &s;pirit of truth, by the &s;ub&s;titu|tion of occa&s;ional deceit, equivocation, &s;ubterfuge, and mental re|&s;ervation.</NOTE></P>
<P>There is a certain precocity of mind which is much helped on by the&s;e &s;uperficial modes of in&s;truc|tion; for frivolous reading will produce its corre&s;|pondent effect, in much le&s;s time than books of &s;olid

in&s;truction; the imagination being liable to be work|ed upon, and the feelings to be &s;et a-going, much fa&s;ter than the under&s;tanding can be opened and the judgment enlightened. A talent for conver&s;ation &s;hould be the re&s;ult of education, not its precur&s;or; it is a golden fruit when &s;uffered to ripen gradually on the tree of knowledge; but if forced in the hot|bed of a circulating library, it will turn out worth|le&s;s and vapid in proportion as it was artificial and premature. Girls who have been accu&s;tomed to de|vour frivolous books, will conver&s;e and write with a far greater appearance of &s;kill as to &s;tyle and &s;enti|ment at twelve or fourteen years old, than tho&s;e of a more advanced age who are under the di&s;cipline of feverer &s;tudies; but the former having early attained to that low &s;tandard which had been held out to them, became &s;tationary; while the latter, quietly progre&s;&s;ive, are pa&s;&s;ing through ju&s;t gradations to a higher &s;train of mind; and tho&s;e who early begin with talking and writing like women, commonly end with thinking and acting like children.</P>
<P>The &s;warms of <HI>Abridgments, Beauties,</HI> and <HI>Com|pendiums,</HI> which form too con&s;iderable a part of a young lady's library, may be con&s;idered in many in|&s;tances as an infallible receipt for making a &s;uperficial mind. The <HI>names</HI> of the renowned characters in hi&s;tory thus become familiar in the mouths of tho&s;e who can neither attach to the ideas of the per&s;on,

the &s;eries of his actions nor the peculiarities of his character. A few fine pa&s;&s;ages from the poets (pa&s;|&s;ages perhaps which derived their chief beauty from their po&s;ition and connection) are huddled together by &s;ome extract-maker, who&s;e brief and di&s;connected patches of broken and di&s;cordant materials, while they inflame young readers with the vanity of recit|ing, neither fill the mind nor form the ta&s;te: and it is not difficult to trace back to their &s;hallow &s;ources the hackney'd quotations of certain <HI>accompli&s;hed</HI> young ladies, who will be frequently found not to have come legitimately by any thing they know: I mean, not to have drawn it from its true &s;pring, the origi|nal works of the author from which &s;ome <HI>beauty-mon|ger</HI> has &s;evered it. Human incon&s;i&s;tency in this, as in other ca&s;es, wants to combine two irreconcileable things; it &s;trives to unite the reputation of know|ledge with the plea&s;ures of idlene&s;s, forgetting that nothing that is valuable can be obtained without &s;acrifices, and that if we would purcha&s;e knowledge we mu&s;t pay for it the fair and lawful price of time and indu&s;try. For this extract-reading, while it accommodates it&s;elf to the convenience, illu&s;trates the character of the age in which we live. The ap|petite for plea&s;ure, and that love of ea&s;e and indo|lence which is generated by it, leave little time or ta&s;te for &s;ound improvement; while the vanity, which is equally a characteri&s;tic of the exi&s;ting peri|od,
<PB N="137" REF="037996_0136_100FAA6411D25CD8">
puts in its claim al&s;o for indulgence, and con|trives to figure away by the&s;e little &s;natches of read|ing, caught in the &s;hort intervals of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive amu&s;e|ments.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the ta&s;te, thus pampered with delicious mor&s;els, is early vitiated. The young reader of the&s;e <HI>clu&s;tered beauties</HI> conceives a di&s;reli&s;h for every thing which is plain, and is impatient if obliged to get through tho&s;e equally nece&s;&s;ary though le&s;s &s;howy parts of a work, in which perhaps the author gives the be&s;t proof of his judgment by keeping under that occa&s;ional brilliancy of which the&s;e &s;uperficial &s;tudents are in con&s;tant pur&s;uit. In all well-written books, there is much that is good which is not daz|zling; and the&s;e &s;hallow critics &s;hould be taught, that it is for the more tame and unintere&s;ting parts of his work, that the judicious poet commonly re|&s;erves tho&s;e flowers, who&s;e beauty is defaced when they are plucked from the garland into which he had &s;o &s;kilfully woven them.</P>
<P>The remark, however, is by no means of general application; there are many valuable works which from their bulk would be almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible to a great number of readers, and a con&s;iderable part of which may not be generally u&s;eful. Even in the be&s;t written books there is often &s;uperfluous matter; au|thors are apt to get enamoured of their &s;ubject, and to dwell too long on it: every per&s;on cannot find
<PB N="138" REF="037996_0137_100FAA66B0983368">
time to read a longer work on any &s;ubject, and yet it may be well for them to know &s;omething on almo&s;t every &s;ubject; tho&s;e, therefore, who abridge volu|minous works judiciou&s;ly, render &s;ervice to the com|munity. But there &s;eems, if I may venture the re|mark, to be a mi&s;take in the <HI>u&s;e</HI> of abridgments. They are put &s;y&s;tematically into the hands of youth, who have, or ought to have, lei&s;ure for the works at large; while abridgments &s;eem more immediately calculated for per&s;ons in more advanced life, who wi&s;h to recall &s;omething they had forgotten; who want to re&s;tore old ideas rather than acquire new ones; or they are u&s;eful for per&s;ons immer&s;ed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, who have little lei&s;ure for voluminous reading. They are excellent to refre&s;h the mind, but not competent to form it.</P>
<P>Perhaps there is &s;ome analogy between the mental and bodily conformation of women. The in&s;tructor therefore &s;hould imitate the phy&s;ician. If the latter pre&s;cribe bracing medicines for a body of which delicacy is the di&s;ea&s;e, the former would do well to prohibit relaxing reading for a mind which is already of too &s;oft a texture, and &s;hould &s;trengthen its feeble tone by invigorating reading.</P>
<P>By &s;oftne&s;s, I cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean imbeci|lity of under&s;tanding, but natural &s;oftne&s;s of heart, together with that indolence of &s;pirit which is fo&s;ter|ed
<PB N="139" REF="037996_0138_100FAA6838AA0310">
by indulging in &s;educing books, and in the general habits of fa&s;hionable life.</P>
<P>I mean not here to recommend books which are im|mediately religious, but &s;uch as exerci&s;e the rea&s;oning faculties, teach the mind to get acquainted with its own nature, and to &s;tir up its own powers. Let not a timid young lady &s;tart if I &s;hould venture to recom|mend to her, after a proper cour&s;e of preparation, to &s;wallow and dige&s;t &s;uch &s;trong meat as Watt's or Duncan's little book of Logic, &s;ome parts of Mr. Locke's E&s;&s;ay on the Human Under&s;tanding, and Bi&s;hop Butler's Analogy. Where there is lei&s;ure, and capacity, and an able friend to comment and to coun&s;el, works of this nature might be profitably &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of &s;o much Engli&s;h Sentiment, French Philo&s;ophy, Italian Love Songs, and fanta&s;tic German imagery and magic wonders. While &s;uch enervating or ab&s;urd books &s;adly di&s;qualify the read|er for &s;olid pur&s;uit or vigorous thinking, the &s;tudies here recommended would act upon the con&s;titution of the mind as a kind of alterative, and, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, would help to brace the intellectual &s;tamina.</P>
<P>This is however by no means intended to exclude works of ta&s;te and imagination, which mu&s;t always make the ornamental part, and of cour&s;e a very con|&s;iderable part, of female &s;tudies. It is only &s;ugge&s;t|ed, that they &s;hould not form them entirely and exclu|&s;ively.
<PB N="140" REF="037996_0139_100FAA6AE5069B70">
For what is called dry tough reading, inde|pendent of the knowledge it conveys, is u&s;eful as an habit, and whole&s;ome as an exerci&s;e. Serious &s;tudy &s;erves to harden the mind for more trying conflicts; it lifts the reader from &s;en&s;ation to intellect; it ab&s;tracts her from the world and its vanities; it fixes a wander|ing &s;pirit, and fortifies a weak one; it divorces her from matter; it corrects that &s;pirit of trifling which &s;he naturally contracts from the frivolous turn of female conver&s;ation, and the petty nature of female employments; it concentrates her attention, a&s;&s;i&s;ts her in a habit of excluding trivial thoughts, and thus even helps to qualify her for religious pur&s;uits. Yes, I repeat it, there is to woman a Chri&s;tian u&s;e to be made of &s;ober &s;tudies; while books of an oppo&s;ite ca&s;t, however unexceptionable they may be &s;ometimes found in point of expre&s;&s;ion, however free from evil in its more gro&s;s and palpable &s;hapes, yet by their very nature and con&s;titution they excite a &s;pirit of relaxation, by exhibiting &s;cenes and ideas which &s;often the mind and &s;et the fancy at work; they impair its general powers of re&s;i&s;tance, and at be&s;t feed habits of improper indulgence, and nouri&s;h a vain and vi&s;ionary indolence, which lays the mind open to error and the heart to &s;eduction.</P>
<P>Women are little accu&s;tomed to clo&s;e rea&s;oning on any &s;ubject; &s;till le&s;s do they inure their minds to con&s;ider particular parts of a &s;ubject; they are not

habituated to turn a truth round, and view it in all its varied a&s;pects and po&s;itions; and this perhaps is one cau&s;e (as will be ob&s;erved in another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chapter on Conver&s;ation.</NOTE> place) of the too great confidence they are di&s;po&s;ed to place in their own opinions. Though their imagination is already too lively, and their judgment naturally incorrect; in educating them we go on to &s;timulate the imagination, while we neglect the regulation of the judgment. They already want balla&s;t, and we make their education con&s;i&s;t in continually crowding more &s;ail than they can carry. Their intellectual pow|ers being &s;o little &s;trengthened by exerci&s;e, makes every little bu&s;ine&s;s appear a hard&s;hip to them: whereas &s;erious &s;tudy would be u&s;eful, were it only that it leads the mind to the habit of conquering dif|ficulties. But it is peculiarly hard to turn at once from the indolent repo&s;e of light reading, from the concerns of mere animal life, the objects of &s;en&s;e, or the frivolou&s;ne&s;s of chit chat; it is peculiarly hard, I &s;ay, to a mind &s;o &s;oftened, to re&s;cue it&s;elf from the dominion of &s;elf-indulgence, to re&s;ume its powers, to call home its &s;cattered &s;trength, to &s;hut out every foreign intru&s;ion, to force back a &s;pring &s;o unnatu|rally bent, and to devote it&s;elf to religious reading, to active bu&s;ine&s;s, to reflection, or &s;elf-examination, whereas to an intellect accu&s;tomed to think at all,
<PB N="142" REF="037996_0141_100FAA7157372550">
the difficulty of thinking &s;eriou&s;ly is obviou&s;ly le&s;&s;en|ed.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to de&s;ire to make &s;chola&s;tic la|dies or female dialecticians; but there is little fear that the kind of books here recommended, if thoroughly &s;tudied, and not &s;uperficially &s;kimmed, will make them pedants or induce conceit; for by &s;hewing them the po&s;&s;ible powers of the human mind, you will bring them to &s;ee the littlene&s;s of their own; and to get acquainted with the mind, and to regu|late and inform it, does not &s;eem the way to puff it up. But let her who is di&s;po&s;ed to be elated with her literary acqui&s;itions, check her vanity by calling to mind the ju&s;t remark or Swift, <Q>that after all her boa&s;ted acquirements, a woman will, generally &s;peaking, be found to po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s of what is called learning than a common &s;chool boy.</Q></P>
<P>Neither is there any fear that this &s;ort of reading will convert ladies into authors. The direct contra|ry effect will be likely to be produced by the peru&s;al of writers who throw the generality of readers at &s;uch an unapproachable di&s;tance as to check pre|&s;umption, in&s;tead of exciting it.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>On the religious and moral u&s;e of hi&s;tory and geography.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BUT while every &s;ort of u&s;eful knowledge &s;hould be carefully imparted to young per&s;ons, it &s;hould be imparted not merely for its own &s;ake, but al&s;o for the &s;ake of its &s;ub&s;erviency to higher things. All human learning &s;hould be taught, not as an end, but a means; and in this view even a le&s;&s;on of hi&s;tory or geography may be converted into a le&s;&s;on of reli|gion. In the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory, the in&s;tructor will accu&s;tom the pupil not merely to &s;tore her memory with facts and anecdotes, and to a&s;certain dates and epochas; but &s;he will accu&s;tom her al&s;o to trace ef|fects to their cau&s;es, to examine the &s;ecret &s;prings of action, and accurately to ob&s;erve the operation of the pa&s;&s;ions. It is only meant to notice here &s;ome few of the moral benefits which may be derived from a judicious peru&s;al of hi&s;tory; and from among other points of in&s;truction, I &s;elect the following:</P>
<P>The &s;tudy of hi&s;tory may &s;erve to give a clearer in&s;ight into the corruption of human nature:</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="037996_0146_100FAA7DAC178D48">
It may &s;how the <HI>plan</HI> of Providence in the direc|tion of events, and in the u&s;e of unworthy in&s;tru|ments:</P>
<P>It may a&s;&s;i&s;t in the <HI>vindication</HI> of Providence, in the common failure of virtue and the &s;ucce&s;s of vice:</P>
<P>It may lead to a di&s;tru&s;t of our own judgment:</P>
<P>It may contribute to our improvement in &s;elf-knowledge.</P>
<P>But to prove to the pupil the important doctrine of human corruption from the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory, will require a truly Chri&s;tian commentator; for, from the low &s;tandard of right e&s;tabli&s;hed by the gene|rality of hi&s;torians, who erect &s;o many per&s;ons in|to good characters who fall &s;hort of the true idea of Chri&s;tian virtue, the una&s;&s;i&s;ted reader will be liable to form very imperfect views of what is real goodne&s;s; and will conclude, as his author &s;ome|times does, that the true idea of human nature is to be taken from the medium between his be&s;t and his wor&s;t characters; without acquiring a ju&s;t notion of that prevalence of evil, which in &s;pite of tho&s;e few brighter luminaries that here and there ju&s;t &s;erve to gild the gloom of hi&s;tory, tends abun|dantly to e&s;tabli&s;h the doctrine.

<P>In this connection may it not be ob&s;erved, that young per&s;ons &s;hould be put on their guard again&s;t a too implicit belief in the flattering accounts which &s;ome voyage-writers are fond of exhibiting of the virtue, amiablene&s;s, and benignity of &s;ome of the countries newly di&s;covered by our circumnavigators, the &s;uperior goodne&s;s a&s;cribed to the Hindoos, and particularly the account of the inhabitants of the Pellew I&s;lands? The&s;e la&s;t indeed have been almo&s;t repre&s;ented as having e&s;caped the univer&s;al taint of our common nature, and would &s;eem by their purity to have &s;prung from another ance&s;tor than Adam.</P>
<P>One cannot forbear &s;u&s;pecting that the&s;e plea&s;ing but &s;omewhat overcharged portraits of man, in his natural &s;tate, are drawn with the invidious de&s;ign, by counteracting the doctrine of human corruption, to degrade the value and even de&s;troy the nece&s;&s;ity of the Chri&s;tian religion. That in countries profe&s;|&s;ing Chri&s;tianity, very many are not Chri&s;tians will be too readily granted. Yet, to &s;ay nothing of the va&s;t &s;uperiority of goodne&s;s in the lives of tho&s;e who

I doubt much, if numbers of the unbelievers of a Chri&s;tian country, from the &s;ounder views and better habits derived incidentally and collaterally, as it were, from the influence of a Go&s;pel, the truth of which however they do not acknowledge, would not &s;tart at many of the actions which the&s;e <HI>heathen perfectioni&s;ts</HI> daily commit without he&s;itation.</P>

But &s;he will carefully guard this doctrine of Divine Providence, thus working out his own purpo&s;es through the &s;ins of his creatures, and by the in&s;trumentality of the wicked, by calling to mind, that while the offender is but a tool in the hands of the great artificer, <Q>yet woe be to him by whom the offence cometh!</Q> She will explain how all the mutations and revolu|tions in &s;tates which appear to us &s;o unaccountable, and how tho&s;e operations of Providence which &s;eem to us &s;o entangled and complicated, all move harmo|niou&s;ly and in perfect order: that there is not an event but has its commi&s;&s;ion; not a misfortune which breaks its allotted rank; not a trial which moves out of its appointed track.

<P>She will explain to her, how even the conque&s;ts of ambition, after having deluged a land with blood, and involved the perpetrator in guilt, and the inno|cent victim in ruin, may yet be made the in&s;truments of opening to future generations the way to com|merce, to civilization, to Chri&s;tianity. She may re|mind her, as they are following Cae&s;ar in his inva&s;ion of Britain, that whereas the conqueror fancied he was only gratifying his own inordinate ambition, extend|ing the flight of the Roman Eagle, immortalizing his own name, and proving that "this world was made for Cae&s;ar;" he was in reality becoming the effectual though uncon&s;cious in&s;trument of leading a land of barbarians to civilization and to &s;cience: and was in fact preparing an i&s;land of Pagans to embrace the religion of Chri&s;t.

<P>For when <Q>Augu&s;tus &s;ent forth a decree that all the world &s;hould be taxed;</Q> he thought he was only enlarging his own imperial power, whereas he was acting in uncon&s;cious &s;ub&s;ervience to the decree of a higher Sovereign, and was helping to a&s;certain by a public act the exact period of Chri&s;t's birth, and furni&s;hing a record of his extraction from that family from which it was predicted by a long line of Prophets that he &s;hould &s;pring. Herod's atrocious murder of the innocents has added an additional circum&s;tance for the confirmation of <HI>our</HI> faith; nay, the treachery of Judas, and the inju&s;tice of Pilate, were the human in&s;truments employed for the &s;alva|tion of the world.</P>
<P>The youth that is not armed with Chri&s;tian princi|ples, will be tempted to mutiny not only again&s;t the ju&s;tice, but the very exi&s;tence of a &s;uperintending Providence, in contemplating tho&s;e frequent in&s;tances which occur in hi&s;tory of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the more virtuous cau&s;e, and the pro&s;perity of the wicked. He will &s;ee with a&s;toni&s;hment that it is Rome which triumphs, while Carthage, which had clearly the better cau&s;e, falls. Now and then indeed a Cicero

It is Octavius who triumphs, and it is over Brutus that he triumphs! It is Tiberius that is enthroned, while Germanicus falls!</P>
<P>Thus his faith in a righteous Providence at fir&s;t view is &s;taggered, and he is ready to &s;ay, Surely it is not God that governs the earth! But on a fuller con&s;ideration, (and here the &s;ugge&s;tions of a Chri&s;tian in&s;tructor are peculiarly wanted), there will appear great wi&s;dom in this very confu&s;ion of vice and vir|tue; for it is calculated to &s;end one's thoughts for|ward to a world of retribution, the principle of re|tribution being &s;o imperfectly e&s;tabli&s;hed in this. It is indeed &s;o far common for virtue to have the ad|vantage here, in point of happine&s;s at lea&s;t, though not of glory, that the cour&s;e of Providence is &s;till calculated to prove that God is on the &s;ide of virtue; but &s;till, virtue is &s;o often un&s;ucce&s;sful, that clearly the God of virtue, in order that his work may be perfect, mu&s;t have in re&s;erve a world of retribution. This confu&s;ed &s;tate of things therefore is ju&s;t that &s;tate which is mo&s;t of all calculated to confirm the deeply con&s;iderate mind in the belief of a future &s;tate: for if all were even here, or very nearly &s;o, &s;hould we not &s;ay <Q>Ju&s;tice is already &s;atisfied, and there <HI>needs</HI> no other world?</Q> On the other hand,

<P>It &s;eems &s;o very important to ground young per|&s;ons in the belief that they will not inevitably meet in this world with reward and &s;ucce&s;s according to their merit, but to habituate them to expect even the mo&s;t virtuous attempts to be often, though not al|ways di&s;appointed, that I am in danger of tautology on this point. This fact is preci&s;ely what hi&s;tory teaches. The truth &s;hould be plainly told to the young reader; and the antidote to that evil, which mi&s;taken and worldly people would expect to ari&s;e from divulging this di&s;couraging doctrine, is <HI>faith.</HI> The importance of faith therefore, and the nece&s;&s;ity of it to real, unbending, and per&s;evering virtue, is &s;urely made plain by profane hi&s;tory it&s;elf.

<P>Di&s;tru&s;t and diffidence in our own judgment &s;eems to be al&s;o an important in&s;truction to be learnt from hi&s;tory.

There is &s;carcely one great event in hi&s;tory which does not, in the i&s;&s;ue, produce effects upon which human fore&s;ight could never have calculated. The &s;ucce&s;s of Augu&s;tus again&s;t his country produced peace in many di&s;tant provinces, who thus cea&s;ed to be hara&s;&s;ed and tormented by this oppre&s;&s;ive republic. Could this effect have been fore&s;een, it might have &s;obered the de&s;pair of Cato, and checked the vehe|mence of Brutus. In politics, in &s;hort in every thing except in morals and religion, all is, to a con&s;ider|able degree, uncertain. This rea&s;oning is not meant to &s;hew that Cato ought not to have <HI>fought,</HI> but that he ought not to have <HI>de&s;ponded</HI> even after the la&s;t bat|tle; and certainly, even upon his own principles, ought not to have killed him&s;elf. It would be departing too much from my object to apply this argument again&s;t tho&s;e who were driven to unrea&s;onable di&s;tru&s;t and de&s;pair by the late &s;ucce&s;&s;es of a neighbouring nation.</P>

<P>While &s;he is inveighing with patriotic indignation, that in a neighbouring metropolis thirty theatres were open every night in time of war and public ca|lamity, is &s;he very clear, that in a metropolis which contains only three, &s;he was not almo&s;t con&s;tantly at one of them in time of war and public calamity al&s;o? For though in a national view it may make a wide difference whether there be in the capital three theatres or thirty, yet, as the &s;ame per&s;on can only go to one of them at once, it makes but little difference as to the quantum of di&s;&s;ipation in the individual. She who rejoices at &s;ucce&s;sful virtue in a hi&s;tory, or at the pro&s;perity of a per&s;on who&s;e intere&s;ts do not in|terfere with her own, may exerci&s;e her &s;elf-know|ledge, by examining whether &s;he rejoices equally at

She who glows with rapture at a virtuous character in hi&s;tory, &s;hould a&s;k her own heart, whether &s;he is equally ready to do ju&s;tice to the fine qualities of her ac|quaintance, though &s;he may not particularly love them; and whether &s;he takes unfeigned plea&s;ure in the &s;uperior talents, virtues, fame, and fortune of tho&s;e whom &s;he profe&s;&s;es to love, though &s;he is eclip&s;ed by them?</P>
<P>In like manner, in the &s;tudy of geography and natural hi&s;tory, the attention &s;hould be habitually turned to the goodne&s;s of Providence, who common|ly adapts the various productions of climates to the peculiar wants of the re&s;pective inhabitants. To il|lu&s;trate my meaning by one or two in&s;tances out of a thou&s;and.

<P>Thus the writers of natural hi&s;tory are perhaps unintentionally magnifying the operations of Provi|dence, when they in&s;i&s;t that animals do not modify and give way to the influence of other climates; but here they too commonly &s;top; and here the pi|ous in&s;tructor will come in, in aid of their deficien|cy; for Philo&s;ophers too &s;eldom trace up cau&s;es, and wonders, and ble&s;&s;ings to their Author.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>On the u&s;e of definitions, and the moral benefits of accuracy in language.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<Q><P>PERSONS having been accu&s;tomed from their cra|dles to learn words before they knew the ideas for which they &s;tand, u&s;ually continue to do &s;o all their lives, never taking the pains to &s;ettle in their minds the determined ideas which belong to them. This want of a preci&s;e &s;ignification in their words, when they come to rea&s;on, <HI>e&s;pecially in moral mat|ters,</HI> is the cau&s;e of very ob&s;cure and uncertain no|tions. They u&s;e the&s;e undetermined words confi|dently, without much troubling their heads about a certain fixed meaning, whereby, be&s;ides the ea&s;e of it, they obtain this advantage, that as in &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e they are &s;eldom in the right, &s;o they are as &s;eldom to be convinced that they are in the wrong, it being ju&s;t the &s;ame to go about to draw tho&s;e per&s;ons out of their mi&s;takes, who have no &s;ettled notions, as to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s a vagrant of his habitation who has no &s;ettled abode.&mdash;The chief end of language being to be under&s;tood,

words &s;erve not for that end when they do not ex|cite in the hearer the &s;ame idea which they &s;tand for in the mind of the &s;peaker.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Locke.</NOTE></P></Q>
<P>I have cho&s;en to &s;helter my&s;elf under the broad &s;anction of the great Author here quoted, with a view to apply this rule in philology to a moral pur|po&s;e; for it applies to the veracity of conver&s;ation as much as to its correctne&s;s; and as &s;trongly recom|mends unequivocal and &s;imple truth, as accurate and ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ion. Scarcely any one perhaps has an adequate conception how much clear and correct ex|pre&s;&s;ions favour the elucidation of truth; and the &s;ide of truth is obviou&s;ly the &s;ide of morals; it is in fact one and the &s;ame cau&s;e; and it is of cour&s;e the &s;ame cau&s;e with that of true religion al&s;o.</P>
<P>It is therefore no worthle&s;s part of education to &s;tudy the preci&s;e meaning of words, and the appro|priate &s;ignification of language. To this end I know no better method than to accu&s;tom young per&s;ons very early to define common words and things; for, as definition &s;eems to lie at the root of correctne&s;s, to be accu&s;tomed to define Engli&s;h words in Engli&s;h, would improve the under&s;tanding more than barely to know what tho&s;e words are called in French or Ita|lian. Or rather, one u&s;e of learning other languages is, becau&s;e definition is often involved in etymo|logy;
<PB N="164" REF="037996_0163_100FAAACF3FC3658">
that is, &s;ince many Engli&s;h words take their derivation from foreign languages, they cannot be &s;o accurately under&s;tood without &s;ome knowledge of tho&s;e languages: but preci&s;ion of any kind too &s;el|dom finds its way into the education of women.</P>
<P>It is perhaps going out of my province to ob&s;erve, that it might be well if young <HI>men</HI> al&s;o, before they entered on the world, were to be furni&s;hed with cor|rect definitions of certain words, the u&s;e of which is become rather ambiguous.

But to return to the youthful part of that &s;ex which is the more immediate object of this little work. With correct definition they &s;hould al&s;o be taught to &s;tudy the &s;hades of words, and this not merely with a view to accuracy of expre&s;&s;ion, but to moral truth.</P>
<P>It may be thought ridiculous to a&s;&s;ert, that morals have any connection with the purity of language, or that the preci&s;ion of truth may be violated through defect of critical exactne&s;s in the three degrees of compari&s;on: yet how frequently do we hear from the dealers in &s;uperlatives, of "mo&s;t admirable," &s;uper|excellent, and "quite perfect" people, who, to plain per&s;ons, not bred in the &s;chool of exaggeration, would appear mere common characters, not ri&s;ing above the level of mediocrity! By this negligence in the ju&s;t application of words, we &s;hall be as much mi&s;led by the&s;e trope and figure ladies, when they de|grade as when they panegyrize; for to a plain and &s;o|ber judgment, a trade&s;man may not be "the mo&s;t good-for-nothing fellow that ever exi&s;ted," merely be|cau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to execute in an hour an order which required a week; a lady may not be "the mo&s;t hideous fright the world ever &s;aw," though the make of her gown may have been ob&s;olete for a month; nor may one's young friend's father be "a mon&s;ter of cruelty," though he may be a quiet gentleman who does not choo&s;e to live at watering-places,

places, but likes to have his daughter &s;tay at home with him in the country.</P>
<P>But of all the parts of &s;peech the interjection is the mo&s;t abundantly in u&s;e with the hyperbolical fair ones. Would it could be added that the&s;e emphatical expletives (if I may make u&s;e of a contradictory term) were not &s;ometimes tinctured with profanene&s;s! Though I am per&s;uaded that idle habit is more at the bottom of this deep offence than intended impiety, yet there is &s;carcely any error of youthful talk which wants &s;everer ca&s;tigation. And an habit exclama|tion &s;hould be rejected by poli&s;hed people as vulgar, even if it were not abhorred as profane.</P>
<P>The habit of exaggerating trifles, together with the grand female failing of mutual flattery, and ela|borate general profe&s;&s;ion of fondne&s;s and attachment, is inconceivably cheri&s;hed by the voluminous private corre&s;pondences in which &s;ome girls are indulged. A facility of &s;tyle, and an ea&s;y turn of expre&s;&s;ion, are dearly purcha&s;ed by the &s;acrifice of that truth, &s;obriety, and correctne&s;s of language, and that in|genuous &s;implicity of character and manners &s;o love|ly in female youth.</P>
<P>But antecedent to this <HI>epi&s;tolary period</HI> of life, they &s;hould have been accu&s;tomed to the mo&s;t &s;crupulous exactne&s;s in whatever they relate.

<P>The conver&s;ation of young females is al&s;o in dan|ger of being overloaded with epithets. As in the warm &s;ea&s;on of youth hardly any thing is &s;een in the true point of vi&s;ion, &s;o hardly any thing is named in naked &s;implicity; and the very &s;en&s;ibility of the feel|ings is partly a cau&s;e of the extravagance of the ex|pre&s;&s;ion. But here, as in other points, the &s;acred writers, particularly of the New Te&s;tament, pre&s;ent us with the pure&s;t models; and its natural and un|laboured &s;tyle of expre&s;&s;ion is perhaps not the meane&s;t evidence of the truth of the go&s;pel. There is through|out the whole narratives, no overcharged character, no elaborate de&s;cription, nothing &s;tudiou&s;ly emphati|cal, as if truth of it&s;elf were weak, and wanted to be helped out. There is little panegyric, and le&s;s invective; none but on great, and awful, and ju&s;ti|fiable occa&s;ions. The authors record their own faults with the &s;ame hone&s;ty as if they were the faults of other men, and the faults of other men with as lit|tle amplification as if they were their own. There is perhaps no book in which adjectives are &s;o &s;paring|ly u&s;ed. A mode&s;t &s;tatement of the fact, with no colouring and little comment, is the example held out to us for correcting the exuberances of pa&s;&s;ion and of language, by that divine volume which fur|ni&s;hes us with the &s;till more important rule of faith
<PB N="168" REF="037996_0167_100FAAB6A6056DD0">
and &s;tandard of practice. Nor is the truth lowered by any feeblene&s;s; for with all this plainne&s;s there is &s;o much force that a few &s;imple touches and artle&s;s &s;trokes of Scripture characters convey a &s;tronger out|line of the per&s;on delineated, than is &s;ometimes given by the mo&s;t elaborate portrait of more artificial hi&s;|torians.</P>
<P>If it be objected to this remark, that many parts of the &s;acred writings abound in a lofty, figurative, and even hyperbolical &s;tyle; this objection applies chiefly to the writings of the Old Te&s;tament, and to the prophetical and poetical parts of that. But this metaphorical and florid &s;tyle is di&s;tinct from the in|accurate and over&s;trained expre&s;&s;ion we have been cen&s;uring; for that only is inaccuracy which leads to a fal&s;e and inadequate conception in the reader or hearer. The lofty &s;tyle of the Ea&s;tern, and of other heroic poetry does not &s;o mi&s;lead, for the metaphor is under&s;tood to be a metaphor, and the imagery is under&s;tood to be ornamental. The &s;tyle of the Scriptures of the Old Te&s;tament is not, it is true, plain in oppo&s;ition to figurative, nor &s;imple in oppo&s;i|tion to florid; but it is plain and &s;imple in the be&s;t &s;en&s;e; it rai&s;es no fal&s;e idea; it gives an exact im|pre&s;&s;ion of the thing it means to convey; and its very tropes and figures, though bold, are never unnatural or affected. Even when it exaggerates, it does not mi&s;repre&s;ent; if it be hyperbolical, it is &s;o either in

compliance with the genius of Oriental language, or in compliance with contemporary cu&s;toms, or becau&s;e the &s;ubject is one which will be mo&s;t forcibly impre&s;|&s;ed by a bold figure. The loftine&s;s of the expre&s;&s;ion deducts nothing from the truth of the circum&s;tance, and the imagery animates the reader without mi&s;lead|ing him.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>On religion.&mdash;The nece&s;&s;ity and duty of early in&s;truction &s;hewn by analogy with human learning.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT has been the fa&s;hion of our late innovators in philo&s;ophy, who have written &s;ome of the mo&s;t bril|liant and popular treati&s;es on education, to decry the practice of early in&s;tilling religious knowledge into the minds of children: it has been alleged that it is of the utmo&s;t importance to the cau&s;e of truth, that the mind of man &s;hould be kept free from prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions; and in particular, that every one &s;hould be left to form &s;uch judgment on religious &s;ubjects as may &s;eem be&s;t to his own rea&s;on in maturer years.</P>
<P>This &s;entiment has received &s;ome countenance from tho&s;e who have wi&s;hed, on the faire&s;t princi|ple, to encourage free inquiry in religion; but it has been pu&s;hed to the blameable exce&s;s here cen&s;ured, chiefly by the new philo&s;ophers; who, while they profe&s;s only an ingenuous zeal for truth, are in fact &s;lily endeavouring to de&s;troy Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, by di&s;countenancing, under the plau&s;ible pretence of free inquiry, all attention whatever to the religious education of our youth.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="037996_0170_100FAAC003927D60">
It is undoubtedly our duty, while we are in&s;tilling principles into the tender mind, to take peculiar care that tho&s;e principles be &s;ound and ju&s;t; that the re|ligion we teach be the religion of the Bible, and not the inventions of human error or &s;uper&s;tition: that the principles we infu&s;e into others, be &s;uch as we our&s;elves have well &s;crutinized, and not the re&s;ult of our credulity or bigotry; nor the mere hereditary, unexamined prejudices of our own undi&s;cerning childhood. It may al&s;o be granted, that it is the duty of every parent to inform the youth, that when his faculties &s;hall have &s;o unfolded them&s;elves as to enable him to examine for him&s;elf tho&s;e principles which the parent is now in&s;tilling, it will be his du|ty &s;o to examine them.</P>
<P>But after making the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, I would mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly in&s;i&s;t that there are certain leading and fundamental truths; that there are certain &s;entiments on the &s;ide of Chri&s;tianity, as well as of virtue and benevolence, in favour of which every child <HI>ought</HI> to be prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and may it not be al&s;o added, that to expect to keep the mind void of all prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, even upon any &s;ubject, appears to be altogether a vain and impracticable attempt? an attempt which argues much ignorance of human nature.</P>
<P>Let it be ob&s;erved here that we are not combating the infidel; that we are not producing evidences and arguments in <HI>favour</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, or trying to win
<PB N="172" REF="037996_0171_100FAAC191735C88">
over the a&s;&s;ent of the reader to that which he di&s;|putes; but that we are taking it for granted, not on|ly that Chri&s;tianity is true, but that we are addre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e who believe it to be true. A&s;&s;uming, there|fore, that there are religious principles which are true, and which ought to be communicated in the mo&s;t effectual manner, the next que&s;tion which ari&s;es &s;eems to be, at what age and in what manner the&s;e ought to be inculcated? That it ought to be at an early period we have both the example and the com|mand of Chri&s;t; for he him&s;elf attended his parents in their annual public devotions at Jeru&s;alem during his own infancy; and afterwards in his public mini|&s;tration encouragingly &s;aid, "Suffer <HI>little</HI> children to come unto me."</P>
<P>But here conceding for the &s;ake of argument what yet cannot be conceded, that &s;ome good rea&s;ons <HI>may</HI> be brought in favour of delay; allowing that &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions as are communicated early may not be very deep; allowing them even to become totally ef|faced by the &s;ub&s;equent corruptions of the heart and of the world; &s;till I would illu&s;trate the importance of early infu&s;ing religious knowledge, by an allu&s;ion drawn from the power of early habit in human learn|ing. Put the ca&s;e, for in&s;tance, of a per&s;on who was betimes initiated in the rudiments of cla&s;&s;ical &s;tudies. Suppo&s;e him after quitting &s;chool to have fallen, either by a cour&s;e of idlene&s;s or of vulgar

pur&s;uits, into a total neglect of &s;tudy. Should this per&s;on at any future period happen to be called to &s;ome profe&s;&s;ion, which would oblige him, as we &s;ay, to rub up his Greek and Latin; his memory &s;till re|taining the unobliterated though faint traces of his early pur&s;uits, he will be able to recover his neglect|ed learning with le&s;s difficulty than he could now be|gin to learn; for he is not again obliged to &s;et out with &s;tudying the &s;imple elements; they come back on being pur&s;ued; they are found on being &s;earched for; the decayed images a&s;&s;ume &s;hape, and &s;trength, and colour; he has in his mind fir&s;t principles to which to recur; the rules of grammar which he has allowed him&s;elf to violate, he has not however for|gotten; he will recall neglected ideas, he will re&s;ume &s;lighted habits far more ea&s;ily than he could now be|gin to acquire new ones. I appeal to Clergymen who are called to attend the dying beds of &s;uch as have been bred in gro&s;s and &s;tupid ignorance of re|ligion, for the ju&s;tne&s;s of this compari&s;on. Do they not find that the&s;e unhappy people have no ideas in common with them? that they po&s;&s;e&s;s no intelligible medium by which to make them&s;elves under&s;tood? that the per&s;ons to whom they are addre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves have no fir&s;t principles to which they can be referred? that they are ignorant not only of the &s;cience, but the language of Chri&s;tianity?</P>

But at wor&s;t, whatever be the event to the child, though in general we are encouraged, from the tenor of Scripture and the cour&s;e of experience, to hope that that event would be favourable, is it nothing for the parent to have acquitted him&s;elf of his prime duty? And will not the parent who &s;o acquits him|&s;elf, with better rea&s;on and more lively hope, &s;uppli|cate the Father of mercies for the reclaiming of a prodigal, who has wandered out of that right path in which he had &s;et him forward, than for the con|ver&s;ion of a neglected creature, to who&s;e feet the Go&s;pel had never been offered as a light? And how different will be the dying reflections even of that parent who&s;e earne&s;t-endeavours have been unhap|pily defeated by the &s;ub&s;equent and voluntary perver|&s;ion of his child, from his who will rea&s;onably ag|gravate his pangs by transferring the &s;ins of his neglected child to the number of his own tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions.</P>

Who can a&s;&s;ure them that they them|&s;elves will live to communicate it?</P>
<P>It is almo&s;t needle&s;s to ob&s;erve that parents who are indifferent about religion, much more tho&s;e who treat it with &s;corn, are not likely to be anxious on this &s;ubject; it is therefore the attention of <HI>religious</HI> parents which is here chiefly called upon; and the more &s;o, as there &s;eems, on this point, an unaccount|able negligence in many of the&s;e, whether it ari&s;e from indolence, fal&s;e principles, or whatever other motive.</P>
<P>But independent of knowledge, it is &s;omething, nay, let philo&s;ophers &s;ay what they will, it is much, to give youth <HI>prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions</HI> in favour of religion, to &s;e|cure their <HI>prejudices</HI> on its &s;ide before you turn them adrift into the world; a world in which, be|fore they can be completely armed with arguments and rea&s;ons, they will be a&s;&s;ailed by numbers who&s;e prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and prejudices, far more than <HI>their</HI> ar|guments and rea&s;ons, attach them to the other &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="037996_0175_100FAACC44F7E960">
Why &s;hould not the Chri&s;tian youth furni&s;h him|&s;elf in a good cau&s;e with the &s;ame natural armour which the enemies of religion wear in a bad one? It is certain that to &s;et out with &s;entiments in favour of the religion of our country is no more an error or a weakne&s;s, than to grow up with a fondne&s;s for our country it&s;elf. Nay, if the love of our country be judged a fair principle, &s;urely a Chri&s;|tian, who is "a citizen of no mean city," may lawfully have <HI>his</HI> attachments too. If patrioti&s;m be an hone&s;t prejudice, Chri&s;tianity is not a &s;ervile one. Nay, let us teach the youth to hug his prejudices rather than to acquire that ver&s;atile and accommodat|ing citizen&s;hip of the world, by which he may be an Infidel in Paris, a Papi&s;t at Rome, and a Mu&s;&s;ul|man at Cairo.</P>
<P>Let me not be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o to elevate politics, or &s;o to depre&s;s religion, as to make any compari&s;on of the value of the one with the other, when I ob&s;erve, that between the true Briti&s;h patriot and the true Chri&s;tian, there will be this common re&s;emblance: the more deeply each of them inquires, the more will he be confirmed in his re&s;pective attachment, the one to his country, the other to his religion. I &s;peak with reverence of the immea&s;urable di&s;tance; but the more the one pre&s;&s;es on the firm arch of our con&s;titution, and the other on that of Chri&s;tianity, the &s;tronger he will find them both.

<P>If we divide the human being into three compo|nent parts, the bodily, the intellectual, and the &s;pirit|ual, is it not rea&s;onable that a portion of care and at|tention be a&s;&s;igned to each in &s;ome degree adequate to its importance?

<P>Or, if I may be allowed to addre&s;s another and a &s;till more dilatory cla&s;s, who are for procra&s;tinating all concern about religion till we are driven to it by actual di&s;tre&s;s, like the &s;ailor who &s;aid, "he thought it was always time enough to begin to pray when the &s;torm began." Of the&s;e I would a&s;k, &s;hall we, with an unaccountable deliberation, defer our anxiety about religion till the man and woman are become &s;o immer&s;ed in the cares of life, or &s;o entangled in its plea&s;ures, that they will have little heart or &s;pirit to embrace a new principle? a principle who&s;e preci&s;e

object it will be to condemn that very life into which they have already embarked; nay to condemn almo&s;t all that they have been doing and thinking ever &s;ince they began to act or think? Shall we, I &s;ay, begin now? or &s;hall we &s;uffer tho&s;e in&s;tructions, to re|ceive which requires all the concentrated powers of a &s;trong and healthy mind, to be put off till the day of excruciating pain, till the period of debility and &s;tupefaction? Shall we wait for that &s;ea&s;on, as if it were the mo&s;t favourable for religious acqui&s;itions, when the &s;en&s;es &s;hall have been palled by exce&s;&s;ive gratification, when the eye &s;hall be tired with &s;eeing, and the ear with hearing? Shall we, when the whole man is breaking up by di&s;ea&s;e or decay, expect that the dim apprehen&s;ion will di&s;cern a new &s;cience, or the obtu&s;e feelings delight them&s;elves with a new plea&s;ure? a plea&s;ure too, not only incompatible with many of the hitherto indulged plea&s;ures, but one which carries with it a &s;trong intimation that tho&s;e plea&s;ures terminate in the death of the &s;oul.</P>

<PB N="183" REF="037996_0182_100FAADFCDA2D070">
think it ab&s;urd to po&s;tpone religious in&s;truction, on principles which, if admitted at all, mu&s;t terminate either in ignorance, or in your propo&s;ing too late to a dying man to begin to learn the totally unknown &s;cheme of Chri&s;tianity. You do not think it impo&s;&s;i|ble that he &s;hould be brought to li&s;ten to the <Q>voice of this charmer,</Q> when he can no longer li&s;ten to "the voice of &s;inging men and &s;inging women." You do not think it unrea&s;onable that immortal be|ings &s;hould delay to devote their days to Heaven, till they have "no plea&s;ure in them" them&s;elves.

<P>For one cannot believe that there is &s;carcely any one, except he be a decided infidel, who does not con&s;ider religion as at lea&s;t a good rever&s;ionary thing; as an object which ought always to occupy a little remote corner of his map of life; the &s;tudy of which, though it is always to be po&s;tponed, is however not to be finally rejected; which, though it cannot conveniently come into his pre&s;ent &s;cheme of life, it is intended &s;omehow or other to take up before death. This awful deception ari&s;es, partly
<PB N="184" REF="037996_0183_100FAAE275CCA0F8">
from the bulk which the objects of time and &s;en&s;e acquire in our eyes by their nearne&s;s; while the in|vi&s;ible realities of eternity are but faintly di&s;cerned by a feeble faith, through a dim and di&s;tant medi|um; and partly from a totally fal&s;e idea of the na|ture of Chri&s;tianity, from a fatal fancy that we can repent at any future period, and that as amendment will always be in our own power, it will be time enough to think of reforming our life, when we &s;hould only think of clo&s;ing it.</P>
<P>But depend upon it, that a heart long hardened, I do not mean by gro&s;s vices merely, but by a fond|ne&s;s for the world, by an habitual and exce&s;&s;ive in|dulgence in the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, is by no means in a favourable &s;tate to admit the light of divine truth, or to receive the impre&s;&s;ions of divine grace. God indeed &s;ometimes &s;hows us by an act of his &s;overeignty, that this wonderful change, the conver|&s;ion of a &s;inner's heart, may be produced without the intervention of human means, to &s;how that the work is HIS. But as this is not way in which the Almighty u&s;ually deals with his creatures, it would be nearly as prepo&s;terous for men to act on this pre&s;umption, as it would be to take no means for the pre&s;ervation of our lives, becau&s;e Je&s;us Chri&s;t rai&s;ed Lazarus from the dead.</P>

<P>On the manner of in&s;tructing young per&s;ons in Religion.&mdash;General remarks on the genius of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I WOULD now with great deference addre&s;s tho&s;e re&s;pectable characters who are really concerned about the be&s;t intere&s;ts of their children; tho&s;e to whom Chri&s;tianity is indeed an important con&s;idera|tion, but who&s;e habits of life have hindered them from giving it its due degree in the &s;cale of educa|tion.</P>
<P>Begin then with con&s;idering that religion is a part, and the mo&s;t prominent part, in your &s;y&s;tem of in|&s;truction. Do not communicate its principles in a random de&s;ultory way; nor &s;cantily &s;tint this bu&s;i|ne&s;s to only &s;uch &s;craps and remnants of time as may be ca&s;ually picked up from the gleanings of other ac|quirements. <Q>Will you bring to God for a &s;acrifice that which co&s;ts you nothing?</Q> Let the be&s;t part of the day, which with mo&s;t people is the earlie&s;t part, be &s;teadily and invariably dedicated to this work by your children, before they are tired with their other &s;tudies, while the intellect is clear, the &s;pirits light, and the attention unfatigued.</P>

Confine not your in&s;tructions to mere verbal ritu|als and dry &s;y&s;tems; but in&s;truct them in a way which &s;hall intere&s;t their feelings; by lively images, and by a warm practical application of what they read to their own hearts and circum&s;tances. There &s;eems to be no good rea&s;on that while every other thing is to be made amu&s;ing, religion alone mu&s;t be dry and uninviting. Do not fancy that a thing is good merely becau&s;e it is dull. Why &s;hould not the mo&s;t entertaining powers of the mind be &s;upremely con&s;ecrated to that &s;ubject which is mo&s;t worthy of their full exerci&s;e? The misfortune is, that religious learning is too often rather con&s;idered as an act of the memory than of the heart and feelings; and that children are turned over to the dry work of getting by rote as a ta&s;k that which they &s;hould get from ex|ample and animated conver&s;ation. Teach them ra|ther, as their Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour taught, by intere&s;ting parables, which while they corrected the heart, left &s;ome exerci&s;e for the ingenuity in their &s;olution, and for the feelings in their application. Teach, as HE taught, by &s;eizing on &s;urrounding objects, pa&s;&s;ing events, local circum&s;tances, peculiar characters, apt allu&s;ions, ju&s;t analogy, appropriate illu&s;tration.

Do, according to your mea&s;ure of ability, what the Holy Spirit which indited the Scriptures has done, always take the &s;en&s;ibility of the learner into your ac|count of the faculties which are to be worked upon. "For the doctrines of the Bible," as the profound and enlightened Bacon ob&s;erves, <Q>are not propo&s;ed to us in a naked logical form, but arrayed in the mo&s;t beautiful and &s;triking colours which creation affords.</Q> By tho&s;e illu&s;trations u&s;ed by Him "who knew what was in man," and therefore be&s;t knew how to addre&s;s him, it was, that the unletter|ed audiences of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles were enabled both to comprehend and to reli&s;h doctrines, which would not readily have made their way to their un|der&s;tandings, had they not fir&s;t touched their hearts; and which would have found acce&s;s to neither the one nor the other, had they been delivered in dry, &s;chola&s;tic di&s;qui&s;itions. Now tho&s;e audiences not being learned, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been nearly in the &s;tate of children, as to their receptive faculties, and to have required nearly the &s;ame &s;ort of in&s;truc|tion; that is, they were more capable of being af|fected with what was &s;imple, and touching, and live|ly, than what was elaborate, ab&s;tru&s;e, and unaffect|ing. Heaven and earth were made to furni&s;h their contributions, when man was to be taught that &s;ci|ence which was to make him wi&s;e unto &s;alvation.

Young people who have been taught religion in a dry and &s;uperficial way, who have had all its drudgeries and none of its plea&s;ures, will probably have acquired &s;o little reli&s;h for it, as to con&s;ider the continued pro&s;ecution of their religious &s;tudies as a badge of their tutelage, as a mark that they are &s;till under &s;ubjection; and will look forward with impatience to the hour of their emancipation from the lectures on Chri&s;tianity. They will long for the period when its le&s;&s;ons &s;hall cea&s;e to be delivered; will conclude that, having once attained &s;uch an age, and arrived at the required proficiency, the ob|ject will be accompli&s;hed and the labour at an end. But let not <HI>your</HI> children "&s;o learn Chri&s;t." Ap|prize them that no &s;pecific day will ever arrive on which they &s;hall &s;ay, I <HI>have</HI> attained; but inform them, that every acqui&s;ition mu&s;t be followed up; knowledge mu&s;t be increa&s;ed; prejudices &s;ubdued; good habits rooted; evil ones eradicated; di&s;po&s;i|tions &s;trengthened; principles confirmed; till, going on from &s;trength to &s;trength, they come <Q>to the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>But though &s;erious in&s;truction will not only be unin|tere&s;ting but irk&s;ome if conveyed to youth in a mere didactic way, yet if their affections are &s;uitably en|gaged, their hearts, &s;o far from nece&s;&s;arily revolting, as &s;ome in&s;i&s;t they will, often receive the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn
<PB N="191" REF="037996_0190_100FAAF287B25258">
truths with alacrity. It is the manner which revolts them, and not the thing.</P>
<P>As it is notorious that men of wit and imagination have been the mo&s;t formidable enemies to Chri&s;tiani|ty; while men, in whom tho&s;e talents have been con&s;ecrated to God, have been &s;ome of her mo&s;t u&s;eful champions, take particular care to pre&s;s that ardent and ever-active power, the <HI>imagination,</HI> into the &s;ervice of religion; this bright and bu&s;y faculty will be leading its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or into perpetual peril, and is an enemy of peculiar potency till it come to be employed in the cau&s;e of God. It is a lion, which though worldly prudence indeed may <HI>chain</HI> &s;o as to prevent outward mi&s;chief, yet the malignity remains within; but when &s;anctified by Chri&s;tianity, the imagination is a lion <HI>tamed;</HI> you have all the benefit of its &s;trength and its activity, dive&s;ted of its mi&s;|chief. God never be&s;towed that noble but re&s;tle&s;s faculty, without intending it to be an in&s;trument of his own glory; though it has been too often &s;et up in rebellion again&s;t him; becau&s;e, in its youthful &s;tirrings, while all alive to evil, it has not been &s;eized upon to fight for its rightful Sovereign, but was early enli&s;ted with little oppo&s;ition under the banners of the world, the fle&s;h, and the devil. Religion is the only &s;ubject in which, under the guidance of an holy and &s;ober-minded prudence, this di&s;cur&s;ive faculty can &s;afely &s;tretch its powers and expand its
<PB N="192" REF="037996_0191_100FAAF6904E8B98">
energies. But let it be remembered, that it mu&s;t be a &s;ound and genuine Chri&s;tianity which can alone &s;o cha&s;ti&s;e and regulate the imagination, as to re&s;train it from tho&s;e errors and exce&s;&s;es into which a fal&s;e, a mi&s;taken, an irregular religion, has too often plung|ed its injudicious and ill-in&s;tructed profe&s;&s;or. To &s;ecure the imagination therefore on the &s;afe &s;ide, and, if I may change the metaphor, to put it under the direction of its true pilot in the &s;tormy voyage of life, is like engaging tho&s;e potent elements, the wind and tide, in your favour.</P>
<P>In your communications with young people, take care to convince them that as religion is not a bu&s;i|ne&s;s to be laid a&s;ide with the le&s;&s;on, &s;o neither is it a &s;ingle branch of duty; &s;ome detached thing, which like an art or a language is to be practi&s;ed &s;eparately, and to have its di&s;tinct periods and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of opera|tion. But let them under&s;tand, that common acts, by the &s;pirit in which they are to be performed, are to be made acts of religion: that Chri&s;tianity may be con&s;idered as having &s;omething of that influence over the conduct which external grace has over the man|ners; for as it is not the performance of &s;ome parti|cular act which denominates any one to be graceful, grace being a &s;pirit diffu&s;ed through the whole &s;y&s;tem which animates every &s;entiment, and informs every action; as &s;he who has true per&s;onal grace has it uniformly, and is not &s;ometimes awkward and &s;ome|times
<PB N="193" REF="037996_0192_100FAAF92927EF38">
elegant; does not &s;ometimes lay it down and &s;ometimes take it up; &s;o religion is not an occa&s;ional act, but an indwelling principle, an in wrought habit, a pervading and informing &s;pirit, from which indeed every act derives all its life, and energy, and beauty.</P>
<P>Give them clear views of the broad di&s;crimination between practical religion and worldly morality. Show them that no good qualities are genuine but &s;uch as flow from the religion of Chri&s;t. Let them learn that the virtues which the better &s;ort of peo|ple, who yet are de&s;titute of true Chri&s;tianity, incul|cate and practi&s;e, re&s;emble tho&s;e virtues which have the love of God for their motive, ju&s;t as counterfeit coin re&s;embles &s;terling gold; they may have, it is true, certain points of re&s;emblance with the others; they may be bright and &s;hining; they have perhaps the image and the &s;uper&s;cription, but they ever want the true di&s;tingui&s;hing properties; they want &s;terling value, purity, and weight. They may indeed pa&s;s current in the traffic of this world, but when brought to the touch&s;tone, they will be found full of alloy; when weighed in the balance of the &s;anctuary, "they will be found wanting;" they will not &s;tand that final trial which is to &s;eparate <Q>the precious from the vile;</Q> they will not <Q>abide the day of <HI>his</HI> coming who is like a refiner's fire.</Q></P>
<P>One error into which even &s;ome good people are apt to fall, is that of endeavouring to deceive young minds by tempori&s;ing expedients. In order to allure
<PB N="194" REF="037996_0193_100FAAFB00018E70">
them to become religious, they exhibit fal&s;e, or faint, or inadequate views of Chri&s;tianity; and while they repre&s;ent it as it really is, as a life of &s;uperior hap|pine&s;s and advantage, they conceal its difficulties, and like the Je&s;uitical Chine&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries, extenuate, or &s;ink, or deny, &s;uch parts of it as are lea&s;t allur|ing to human pride.

<P>In&s;tead of repre&s;enting to the young Chri&s;tian that it may be po&s;&s;ible by a prudent ingenuity at once to pur&s;ue, with equal ardour and &s;ucce&s;s, worldly fame and eternal glory, would it not be more hone&s;t to tell him fairly and unambiguou&s;ly that there are two di&s;|tinct roads between which there is a broad boundary line? that there are two irreconcileable intere&s;ts; that he mu&s;t for&s;ake the one if he would cleave to the other? that there are two &s;orts of characters at eternal variance? that nothing &s;hort of ab&s;olute de|ci&s;ion can make a confirmed Chri&s;tian?

reward is there individually promi&s;ed to its concomi|tant virtue. Show your pupil that to that <Q>poverty of &s;pirit</Q> to which the kingdom of heaven is promi&s;ed, it would be incon&s;i&s;tent to expect that the recompence of human commendation &s;hould be al&s;o attached; that to that "purity of heart" to which the beatific vi&s;ion is annexed, it would be unrea|&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e you can unite the prai&s;e of licenti|ous wits, or the admiration of a catch club.

It is the language of true love; of that love with which a merciful God loved the world, when he &s;pared not his own Son. Do not then try to conceal from them, that the life of a Chri&s;tian is nece&s;&s;arily oppo&s;ite to the life of the world; and do not &s;eek, by a vain attempt at ac|commodation, to reconcile that difference which Chri&s;t him&s;elf has pronounced to be irreconcileable.</P>
<P>May it not be partly owing to the want of a due introduction to the knowledge of the real nature and &s;pirit of religion, that &s;o many young Chri&s;tians, who &s;et out in a fair and flouri&s;hing way, decline and wither when they come to perceive the requi&s;itions of experimental Chri&s;tianity? requi&s;itions which they had not &s;u&s;pected of making any part of the plan.</P>
<P>People are no more to be cheated into religion than into learning. The &s;ame &s;pirit which influences your oath in a court of ju&s;tice &s;hould influence your di&s;|cour&s;e in that court of equity&mdash;your family. Your children &s;hould be told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to add, that it mu&s;t be done gradually and di&s;creetly. We

Explain to them that great <HI>worldly</HI> attain|ments are never made without great &s;acrifices; that the merchant cannot become rich without indu&s;try; the &s;tate&s;man eminent without labour; the &s;cholar learned without &s;tudy; the hero renowned without danger: would it not then, on human principles, be unrea&s;onable to think that the Chri&s;tian alone &s;hould obtain a triumph without a warfare? the highe&s;t prize with the lowe&s;t exertions? an eternal crown without a pre&s;ent cro&s;s? and that heaven is the only reward which the idle may reckon upon? No: though &s;alvation "be the <HI>gift</HI> of God," yet it mu&s;t be <HI>"worked out."</HI> Convince your young friends, however, that in this ca&s;e the difficulty bears no pro|portion to the prize; though in one re&s;pect the point of re&s;emblance fails, and that mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly for the Chri&s;tian; for while, even by the mo&s;t pro|bable means, which are the union of talents with diligence, no human pro&s;perity can be in&s;ured to the worldly candidate; while the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful adven|turer may fail by the fault of another; while the be&s;t concerted project of the &s;tate&s;man may be cru&s;h|ed; the brave&s;t hero lo&s;e the battle; the brighte&s;t genius fail of getting bread; and while, moreover, the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from &s;ucce&s;s in the&s;e may be no

<P>Beware at the &s;ame time of &s;etting up any act of &s;elf-denial or mortification as the <HI>procuring</HI> cau&s;e of &s;alvation.

This would be to &s;end your children, not to the Go&s;pel to learn their Chri&s;tiani|ty, but to the Monks and A&s;cetics of the middle ages; it would be &s;ending them to Peter the Hermit, and the holy fathers of the De&s;ert, and not to Peter the Apo&s;tle and his Divine Ma&s;ter. Mortification is not the price; it is nothing more than the di&s;ci|pline of a &s;oul of which &s;in is the di&s;ea&s;e, the diet pre&s;cribed by the great phy&s;ician. Without this guard the young devout Chri&s;tian would be led to fancy that ab&s;tinence, pilgrimage, and penance might be adopted as the cheap &s;ub&s;titute for the &s;ubdued de&s;ire, the conquered temptation, and the obedient will; and would be almo&s;t in as much danger, on the one hand, of &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s ari&s;ing from au|&s;terities

and mortification, as &s;he would be, on the other, from &s;elf-gratification in the indulgences of the world. And while you carefully impre&s;s on her the nece&s;&s;ity of living a life of &s;trict obedience if &s;he would plea&s;e God, do not neglect to remind her al&s;o that a complete renunciation of her own perform|ances as a ground of merit, <HI>purcha&s;ing</HI> the favour of God by their own intrin&s;ic worth, is included in that obedience.</P>
<P>It is of the la&s;t importance, in &s;tamping on young minds a true impre&s;&s;ion of the genius of Chri&s;tianity, to po&s;&s;e&s;s them with a conviction that it is the purity of the motive which not only gives worth and beau|ty, but which, in a Chri&s;tian &s;en&s;e, gives life and &s;oul to the be&s;t action: nay, that while a right in|tention will be acknowledged and accepted at the final judgment, even without the act, the act it&s;elf will be di&s;owned which wanted the ba&s;is of a pure de&s;ign. <Q>Thou did&s;t well that it was in thy <HI>heart</HI> to build me a temple,</Q> &s;aid the Almighty to that Monarch whom yet he permitted not to build it.

"Depart from me, I never knew you," is not the malediction denounced on the &s;ceptic or the &s;coffer,

but on the unfruitful worker of "miracles," on the un&s;anctified utterer of "prophecies;" for even acts of piety wanting the purifying principle, however they may dazzle men, offend God. Cain &s;acrificed, Balaam prophe&s;ied, Rou&s;&s;eau wrote the mo&s;t &s;ublime panegyric on the <HI>Son of Mary,</HI> VOLTAIRE BUILT A CHURCH! nay, &s;o &s;uperior was <HI>his</HI> affectation of &s;anctity, that he o&s;tentatiou&s;ly declared, that while others were rai&s;ing churches to <HI>Saints,</HI> there was one man at lea&s;t who would erect his church to <HI>God:</HI> that God who&s;e altars he was overthrowing, who&s;e name he was vilifying, who&s;e go&s;del he was extermi|nating, and the very name of who&s;e Son he had &s;olemn|ly pledged him&s;elf to blot from the face of the earth!</P>
<P>Though it be impo&s;&s;ible here to enumerate all tho&s;e Chri&s;tian virtues which &s;hould be impre&s;&s;ed in the progre&s;s of a Chri&s;tian education, yet in this con|nection I cannot forbear mentioning one which more immediately grows out of the &s;ubject; and to re|mark that the principle which &s;hould be the inva|riable concomitant of all in&s;truction, and e&s;pecially of religious in&s;truction, is humility. As this tem|per is inculcated in every page of the Go&s;pel; as it is deducible from every precept and every action of Chri&s;t; that is a &s;ufficient intimation that it &s;hould be made to grow out of every &s;tudy, that it &s;hould be grafted on every acqui&s;ition. It is the turning point, the leading principle indicative of the very genius of Chri&s;tianity. This cha&s;ti&s;ing quality
<PB N="201" REF="037996_0200_100FAB0D70E8EF60">
&s;hould therefore be con&s;tantly made in education to operate as the only counteraction of that <Q>knowledge which puffeth up.</Q> Youth &s;hould be taught that as humility is the di&s;criminating characteri&s;tic of our religion, therefore a proud Chri&s;tian, a haughty di&s;|ciple of a crucified Ma&s;ter, furni&s;hes perhaps a &s;tronger oppo&s;ition in terms than the whole compa&s;s of language can exhibit. They &s;hould be taught that humility being the appropriate grace of Chri&s;tianity, is what makes Chri&s;tian and Pagan virtues <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> different. The virtues of the Romans, for in&s;tance, were obviou&s;ly founded in pride; as a proof of this, they had not even a word in their copious language to expre&s;s humility, but what was u&s;ed in a bad &s;en&s;e, and conveyed the idea of meanne&s;s or vilene&s;s. Chri&s;|tianity &s;o &s;tands on its own &s;ingle ground, is &s;o far from a&s;&s;imilating it&s;elf to the &s;pirit of other religions, that, unlike the Roman Emperor, who though he would not become a Chri&s;tian, yet ordered that the image of Chri&s;t &s;hould be &s;et up in the Pantheon with tho&s;e of the heathen gods, and be wor&s;hip|ped in common with them; Chri&s;tianity not only re|jects all &s;uch partner&s;hips with other religions, but it pulls down their images, defaces their temples, tramples on their honours, founds its own exi&s;tence on the ruins of &s;purious religions and &s;purious virtues, and will be every thing when it is admitted to be any thing.</P>
<P>Will it be going too much out of the way to ob|&s;erve, that Chri&s;tian Britain retaliates upon Pagan
<PB N="202" REF="037996_0201_100FAB102129CEA0">
Rome? For if the former u&s;ed humility in a bad &s;en&s;e, has not the latter learnt to u&s;e pride in a good one? May we, without impertinence, venture to re|mark, that, in the deliberations of as honourable and upright political a&s;&s;emblies as ever adorned, or, under Providence, upheld a country; in orations which leave us nothing to envy in Attic or Roman eloquence in their be&s;t days; it were to be wi&s;hed that we did not borrow from Rome an epithet which &s;uited the genius of her religion, as much as it mili|tates again&s;t that of ours? The panegyri&s;t of the battle of Marathon, of Plataea, or of Zama, might with propriety &s;peak of a "proud day," or a <Q>proud event,</Q> or a "proud &s;ucce&s;s." But &s;urely the Chri&s;tian encomia&s;ts of the battle of the Nile may, from their abundance, &s;elect an epithet better appro|priated to &s;uch a victory&mdash;a victory which, by pre|&s;erving Europe, has perhaps pre&s;erved that religion which &s;ets its foot on the very neck of pride, and in which the conqueror him&s;elf, even in the fir&s;t ardors of triumph, forgot not to a&s;cribe the victory to AL|MIGHTY GOD. Let us leave to the enemy both the term and the thing; arrogant words being the only weapons in which we mu&s;t ever vail to their decided &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>Above all things then you &s;hould beware that your pupils do not take up with a vague, general, and undefined religion; but look to it that their Chri&s;tianity be really the religion of Chri&s;t. In&s;tead

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Hints &s;ugge&s;ted for furni&s;hing young per&s;ons with a &s;cheme of prayer.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THOSE who are aware of the ine&s;timable value of prayer them&s;elves, will naturally be anxious not only that this duty &s;hould be earne&s;tly inculcated on their children, but that they &s;hould be taught it in the be&s;t manner; and <HI>&s;uch</HI> parents need little per&s;ua&s;ion or coun&s;el on the &s;ubject. Yet children of decent and orderly (I will not &s;ay of &s;trictly religious) fami|lies are often &s;o &s;uperficially in&s;tructed in this impor|tant bu&s;ine&s;s, that it is not unu&s;ual, when they are a&s;ked what prayers they u&s;e, to an&s;wer, <Q>the Lord's Prayer and the <HI>Creed.</HI></Q> And even &s;ome who are better taught, are not always made to under&s;tand with &s;ufficient clearne&s;s the &s;pecific di&s;tinction be|tween the two; that the one is the confe&s;&s;ion of their <HI>faith,</HI> and the other the model for their <HI>&s;upplica|tions.</HI> By this confu&s;ed and indi&s;tinct beginning, they &s;et out with a perplexity in their ideas, which is not always completely di&s;entangled in more ad|vanced life.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="037996_0205_100F7C674B9AB7E8">
An intelligent mother will &s;eize the fir&s;t occa&s;ion which the child's opening under&s;tanding &s;hall allow, for making a little cour&s;e of lectures on the Lord's Prayer, taking every divi&s;ion or &s;hort &s;entence &s;epa|rately; for each furni&s;hes valuable materials for a di&s;tinct lecture. The child &s;hould be led gradually through every part of this divine compo&s;ition; &s;he &s;hould be taught to break it into all the regular divi|&s;ions, into which indeed it &s;o naturally re&s;olves it&s;elf. She &s;hould be made to comprehend one by one each of its &s;hort but weighty &s;entences; to amplify and &s;pread them out for the purpo&s;e of better under&s;tand|ing them, not in their mo&s;t exten&s;ive and critical, but in their mo&s;t &s;imple and obvious meaning. For in tho&s;e conden&s;ed and &s;ub&s;tantial expre&s;&s;ions, every word is an ingot, and will bear beating out; &s;o that the teacher's difficulty will not &s;o much be what &s;he &s;hall &s;ay as what &s;he &s;hall &s;uppre&s;s; &s;o abundant is the expo&s;itory matter which this &s;uccinct pattern &s;ugge&s;ts.</P>
<P>When the child has a pretty good conception of the meaning of each divi&s;ion, &s;he &s;hould then be made to ob&s;erve the connection, relation, and depen|dance of the &s;everal parts of this prayer one upon another; for there is great method and connection in it. We pray that the <Q>kingdom of God may come,</Q> as the be&s;t means to "hallow his name;" and that by us, the obedient &s;ubjects of this king|dom, "his will may be done." A judicious inter|preter
<PB N="207" REF="037996_0206_100FAB1EA42A2DC0">
will ob&s;erve how logically and con&s;equently one clau&s;e grows out of another, though &s;he will u&s;e neither the word logical nor con&s;equence: for all ex|planations &s;hould be made in the mo&s;t plain and fa|miliar terms, it being words, and not things, which commonly perplex children, if, as it &s;ometimes hap|pens, the teacher, though not wanting &s;en&s;e, want per&s;picuity and &s;implicity.</P>
<P>The young per&s;on, from being made a complete mi&s;tre&s;s of this &s;hort compo&s;ition, (which as it is to be her guide and model through life, too much pains cannot be be&s;towed on it,) will have a clearer con|ception, not only of its individual contents, but of prayer in general, than many ever attain, though their memory has been perhaps loaded with long and unexplained forms, which they have been ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;wallow in the lump without &s;crutiny. Prayer &s;hould not be &s;o &s;wallowed. It is a regular pre&s;cription, which &s;hould &s;tand analy&s;is and exami|nation: it is not a charm, the &s;ucce&s;sful operation of which depends on your blindly taking it, without knowing what is in it, and in which the good you receive is promoted by your ignorance of its contents.</P>
<P>I would have it under&s;tood that by the&s;e little comments, I do not mean that the child &s;hould be put to learn dry, and to her, unintelligible, expo&s;iti|ons; and here I mu&s;t remark in general, that the teacher is &s;ometimes apt to relieve her&s;elf at the
<PB N="208" REF="037996_0207_100FAB202C6737D0">
child's expence, by loading the <HI>memory</HI> of a little creature on occa&s;ions in which far other faculties &s;hould be put in exerci&s;e. The child her&s;elf &s;hould be made to furni&s;h a good part of the commentary by her an&s;wers; in which an&s;wers &s;he will be much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the judgment the teacher u&s;es in her man|ner of que&s;tioning. And the youthful under&s;tand|ing, when its powers are properly &s;et at work, will &s;oon &s;trengthen by exerci&s;e &s;o as to furni&s;h rea&s;onable if not very correct an&s;wers.</P>
<P>Written forms of prayer are not only u&s;eful and proper, but indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. But I will ha|zard the remark, that if children are thrown <HI>exclu&s;ive|ly</HI> on the be&s;t forms, if they are made to commit them to memory like a copy of ver&s;es, and to repeat them in a dry, cu&s;tomary way, they will produce little effect on their minds. They will not under|&s;tand what they repeat, if we do not early open to them the important <HI>&s;cheme</HI> of prayer. Without &s;uch an elementary introduction to this duty, they will afterwards be either ignorant or enthu&s;ia&s;ts, or both. We &s;hould give them <HI>knowledge</HI> before we can ex|pect them to make much progre&s;s in <HI>piety,</HI> and as a due preparative to it: Chri&s;tian in&s;truction in this re|&s;embling the &s;un, who, in the cour&s;e of his commu|nications, gives light before he gives heat. And to excite a &s;pirit of devotion without infu&s;ing that knowledge out of which it is to grow, is practically
<PB N="209" REF="037996_0208_100FAB22CA87A208">
reviving the popi&s;h maxim, that Ignorance is the mother of Devotion, and virtually adopting the po|pi&s;h rule, of praying in an unknown tongue.</P>
<P>Children, let me again ob&s;erve, will not attend to their prayers if they do not under&s;tand them; and they will not under&s;tand them, if they are not taught to analy&s;e, to di&s;&s;ect them, to know their component parts, and to methodi&s;e them.</P>
<P>It is not enough to teach them to con&s;ider prayer under the general idea that it is an application to God for what they want, and an acknowledgment for what they have. This, though true in the gro&s;s, is not &s;ufficiently preci&s;e and correct. They &s;hould learn to define and to arrange all the different parts of prayer. And as a preparative to prayer it&s;elf, they &s;hould be impre&s;&s;ed with as clear an idea as the nature of the &s;ubject admits, of <Q>HIM with whom they have to do.</Q> His omnipre&s;ence is per|haps, of all his attributes, that of which we may make the fir&s;t practical u&s;e. Every head of prayer is founded on &s;ome great &s;criptural truths, which truths the little analy&s;is here &s;ugge&s;ted will material|ly a&s;&s;i&s;t to fix in their minds.</P>
<P>On the knowledge that "God is," that he is an infinitely holy Being, and that <Q>he is the rewarder of all them that diligently &s;eek him,</Q> will be grounded the fir&s;t part of prayer, which is <HI>adoration.</HI> The creature devoting it&s;elf to the Creator, or <HI>&s;elf-dedication,</HI>
<PB N="210" REF="037996_0209_100FAB2566817F88">
next pre&s;ents it&s;elf. And if they are fir&s;t taught that important truth, that as needy creatures they want help, which may be done by &s;ome ea&s;y analogy, they will ea&s;ily be led to under&s;tand how naturally <HI>petition</HI> forms a mo&s;t con&s;iderable branch of prayer: and divine grace being among the things for which they are to petition, this naturally &s;ug|ge&s;ts to the mind the doctrine of the influences of the &s;pirit. And when to this is added the convic|tion, which will be readily worked into an ingenu|ous mind, that as offending creatures they want pardon, the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>confe&s;&s;ion</HI> will ea&s;ily be made intelligible to them. But they &s;hould be brought to under&s;tand that it mu&s;t not be &s;uch a general and vague confe&s;&s;ion as awakens no &s;en&s;e of per|&s;onal humiliation, as excites no recollection of their own more peculiar and individual faults. But it mu&s;t be a confe&s;&s;ion founded on &s;elf-knowledge, which is it&s;elf to ari&s;e out of the practice of &s;elf-examination: for want of this &s;ort of di&s;criminating habit, a well-meaning but ill-in&s;tructed girl may catch her&s;elf confe&s;&s;ing the &s;ins of &s;ome other per|&s;on, and omitting tho&s;e which are more e&s;pecially her own. On the gladne&s;s of heart natural to youth, it will be le&s;s difficult to impre&s;s the delightful duty of <HI>thank&s;giving,</HI> which forms &s;o con&s;iderable a branch of prayer. In this they &s;hould be habituated to recapitulate not only their general, but to enume|rate

And here the memory may be employed to good purpo&s;e; for be|ing the fir&s;t faculty which is ripened, and which is indeed perfected when the others are only beginning to unfold them&s;elves, this is an intimation of Provi|dence that it &s;hould be the fir&s;t &s;eized on for the be&s;t u&s;es. It &s;hould therefore be devoted to lay in a &s;tock of the more ea&s;y and devotional parts of Scripture.

of all the parts of prayer; and will be able to extract and appropriate texts under each re&s;pective head, &s;o as to exhibit, without help, complete &s;peci|mens of every part of prayer. By confining them entirely to the &s;en&s;e, and nearly to the words of Scripture, they will be pre&s;erved from enthu&s;ia&s;m, from irregularity, and conceit. By being obliged continually to apply for them&s;elves, they will get a habit in all their difficulties, of <Q>&s;earching the Scriptures,</Q> which may be u&s;eful to them on fu|ture and more trying occa&s;ions. But I would <HI>confine</HI> them to the Bible; for were they allowed with equal freedom to ran&s;ack other books with a view to get helps to embelli&s;h their little compo&s;itions, or rather compilations, they might be tempted to pa&s;s off for their own what they pick up from other, which might tend at once to make them both vain and de|ceitful. This is a temptation to which they are too much laid open when they get commended for any pilfered pa&s;&s;age with which they decorate their little themes and letters. But in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance there is no danger of any &s;imilar deception, for there is &s;uch a &s;acred &s;ignature &s;tamped on every Scripture phra&s;e, that the owner's name can never be defaced or torn off from the goods, either by fraud or vio|lence.</P>

had to this their future application; and that they were employed, but without any intimation of your &s;ub&s;equent de&s;ign, in learning &s;uch as may be be&s;t turned to this account. In the 139th the fir&s;t great truth to be imprinted on the young heart, as was before ob&s;erved, is unfolded with &s;uch a mixture of maje&s;tic grandeur, and &s;uch an intere&s;ting variety of intimated and local circum&s;tances, as is likely to &s;eize on the quick and lively feelings of youth. The aw|ful idea that that Being whom &s;he is taught to rever|ence, is not only <HI>in general</HI> <Q>acquainted with all her ways,</Q> but that <Q>he is about her path, and about her bed,</Q> be&s;tows &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of real and pre&s;ent exi&s;tence on <HI>him</HI> of whom &s;he is apt to conceive as having his di&s;tant habitation only in Heaven, as will help her to realize the &s;en&s;e of his actual pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The 103d P&s;alm will open to the mind rich and abundant &s;ources of expre&s;&s;ion for gratitude and thank&s;giving, and it includes &s;piritual as well as tem|poral favours. It illu&s;trates the mercies of God by familiar and dome&s;tic images, of &s;uch peculiar ten|derne&s;s and endearment, as are calculated to &s;trike upon every chord of filial fondne&s;s in the heart of an affectionate child. The 51&s;t &s;upplies an infinite variety of matter in whatever relates to confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in, or to &s;upplication for the aids of the Spirit. The 23d abounds with captivating expre&s;&s;ions of the protecting goodne&s;s of their heavenly Father, con|veyed

by pa&s;toral imagery of uncommon &s;weetne&s;s: in &s;hort the greater part of the&s;e beautiful compo&s;i|tions overflow with materials for every head of prayer.</P>
<P>The child who, while &s;he was engaged in learn|ing the&s;e Scriptures, was not aware that there was any &s;pecific object to be an&s;wered by it, will after|wards feel an unexpected plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the application of her petty labours, when &s;he is called to draw out from her little trea&s;ury of knowledge the &s;tores &s;he has been collecting; and will be plea&s;|ed to find that without any fre&s;h application to &s;tu|dy, for &s;he is now obliged to exerci&s;e a higher facul|ty than memory, &s;he has lying ready in her mind the materials with which &s;he is now called upon to work. Her judgment mu&s;t be &s;et about &s;electing one or two, or more texts which &s;hall contain the &s;ub&s;tance of every &s;pecific head of prayer before no|ticed; and it will be a farther exerci&s;e to her under|&s;tanding to concatenate the detached parts into one regular whole, occa&s;ionally varying the arrangement as &s;he likes; that is, changing the order, &s;ometimes beginning with invocation, &s;ometimes with confe&s;&s;ion; &s;ometimes dwelling longer on one part, &s;ometimes on another. As the hard&s;hips of a religious Sunday are often &s;o pathetically pleaded, as making one of the heavy burdens of religion; and as the friends of re|ligion are &s;o often called upon to mitigate its rigours,

might not &s;uch an exerci&s;e as has been here &s;ugge&s;t|ed help to vary its occupations?</P>
<P>The habits of the pupil being thus early formed, her memory, attention, and intellect being bent in a right direction, and the exerci&s;e invariably maintain|ed, may one not rea&s;onably hope that her <HI>affections</HI> al&s;o, through divine grace, may become intere&s;ted in the work, till &s;he will be enabled <Q>to pray with the &s;pirit and with the under&s;tanding al&s;o?</Q> She will now be qualified to u&s;e a well-compo&s;ed form with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and advantage; for &s;he will now u&s;e it not mechanically, but rationally.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The practical u&s;es of female knowledge.&mdash;Sketch of the female character.&mdash;A comparative view of both &s;exes.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE chief end to be propo&s;ed in cultivating the under&s;tandings of women, is to qualify them for the practical purpo&s;es of life. Their knowledge is not often like the learning of men, to be reproduced in &s;ome literary compo&s;ition, nor ever in any learned profe&s;&s;ion; but it is to come out in conduct. A lady &s;tudies, not that &s;he may qualify her&s;elf to become <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">orator or a pleader; not that &s;he may learn to debate, but to act. She is to read the be&s;t books,
<PB N="6" REF="037996_0221_100FAB4738AB56E8">
not &s;o much to enable her to talk of them, as to bring the improvement which they furni&s;h, to the rectification of her principles, and the formation of her habits. The great u&s;es of &s;tudy are to enable her to regulate her own mind, and to be u&s;eful to others.</P>
<P>To woman therefore, whatever be her rank, I would recommend a predominance of tho&s;e more &s;ober &s;tudies, which, not having di&s;play for their object, may make her wi&s;e without vanity, happy without witne&s;&s;es, and content without panegyri&s;ts; the exerci&s;e of which will not bring celebrity, but improve u&s;efulne&s;s. She &s;hould pur&s;ue every kind of &s;tudy which will teach her to elicit truth; which will lead her to be intent upon realities; will give preci&s;ion to her ideas; will make an exact mind; every &s;tudy which, in&s;tead of &s;timulating her &s;en&s;i|bility, will cha&s;ti&s;e it; which will give her definite notions; will bring the imagination under dominion; will lead her to think, to compare, to combine, to methodi&s;e; which will confer &s;uch a power of di&s;|crimination that her judgment &s;hall learn to reject what is dazzling if it be not &s;olid; and to prefer, not what is &s;triking, or bright, or new, but what is ju&s;t. That kind of knowledge which is rather fitted for home con&s;umption than foreign exportation, is peculiarly adapted to women.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037996_0222_100FAB49DB1F1D80">
It is becau&s;e the &s;uperficial nature of their educa|tion furni&s;hes them with a fal&s;e and low &s;tandard of intellectual excellence, that women have &s;ometimes become ridiculous by the unfounded preten&s;ions of literary vanity: for it is not the really learned but the &s;matterers, who have generally brought their &s;ex into di&s;credit, by an ab&s;urd affectation, which has &s;et them on de&s;pi&s;ing the duties of ordinary life. There have not indeed been wanting (but the charac|ter is not now common) <HI>precieu&s;es ridicules,</HI> who, a&s;|&s;uming a &s;uperiority to the &s;ober cares which ought to occupy their &s;ex, have claimed a lofty and &s;uper|cilious exemption from the dull and plodding drudg|eries
<Q><L>Of this dim &s;peck called earth!</L></Q>
who have affected to e&s;tabli&s;h an unnatural &s;eparation between talents and u&s;efulne&s;s, in&s;tead of bearing in mind that talents are the great appointed in&s;truments of u&s;efulne&s;s; who have acted as if knowledge were to confer on woman a kind of fanta&s;tic &s;overeignty, which &s;hould exonerate her from female duties; whereas it is only meant the more eminently to qua|lify her for the performance of them. For a woman of real &s;en&s;e will never forget, that while the greater part of her proper duties are &s;uch as the mo&s;t mode|rately gifted may fulfil with credit, (&s;ince Providence never makes that to be very difficult, which is generally nece&s;&s;ary), yet the mo&s;t highly endowed
<PB N="8" REF="037996_0223_100FAB4B636C8310">
are equally bound to fulfil them; and the humble&s;t of the&s;e offices, performed on Chri&s;tian principles, are whole&s;ome for the minds even of the mo&s;t en|lightened, and tend to the ca&s;ting down of tho&s;e high imaginations which women of genius are too much tempted to indulge.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance; ladies who&s;e natural vanity has been aggravated by a fal&s;e education, may look down on <HI>oeconomy</HI> as a vulgar attainment, unworthy of the at|tention of an highly cultivated intellect; but this is the fal&s;e e&s;timate of a &s;hallow mind. OEconomy, &s;uch as a woman of fortune is called on to practi&s;e, is not merely the petty detail of &s;mall daily expences, the &s;habby curtailments and &s;tinted par&s;imony of a little mind operating on little concerns; but it is the exerci&s;e of a &s;ound judgment exerted in the compre|hen&s;ive outline of order, of arrangement, of di&s;tri|bution; of regulations by which alone well governed &s;ocieties, great and &s;mall, &s;ub&s;i&s;t. She who has the be&s;t regulated mind will, other things being equal, have the be&s;t regulated family. As in the &s;uperin|tendence of the univer&s;e, wi&s;dom is &s;een in its <HI>effects;</HI> and as in the vi&s;ible works of Providence that which goes on with &s;uch beautiful regularity is the re&s;ult not of chance but of de&s;ign; &s;o that management which &s;eems the mo&s;t ea&s;y is commonly the con&s;e|quence of the be&s;t concerted plan. A &s;ound oecono|my is a &s;ound under&s;tanding brought into action:
<PB N="9" REF="037996_0224_100FAB4E023DD658">
it is calculation realized; it is the doctrine of pro|portion reduced to practice; it is fore&s;eeing con&s;e|quences and guarding again&s;t them; it is expecting contingencies and being prepared for them. The difference is, that to a narrow minded vulgar oecono|mi&s;t the details are continually pre&s;ent; &s;he is over|whelmed by their weight, and is perpetually be&s;peak|ing your pity for her labours and your prai&s;e for her exertions; &s;he is afraid you will not &s;ee how much &s;he is harra&s;&s;ed. Little events, and trivial operations, engro&s;s her whole &s;oul; while a woman of &s;en&s;e, having provided for their probable recurrence, guards again&s;t the inconveniencies, without being di&s;concerted by the ca&s;ual ob&s;tructions which they offer to her general &s;cheme.</P>
<P>Superior talents however are not &s;o common, as, by their frequency, to offer much di&s;turbance to the general cour&s;e of human affairs; and many a lady, who tacitly accu&s;es her&s;elf of neglecting her ordina|ry duties becau&s;e &s;he is a <HI>genius,</HI> will perhaps be found often to accu&s;e her&s;elf as unju&s;tly as good St. Jerome, when he laments that he was beaten by the Angel for being too Ciceronian in his &s;tyle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Owen.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The truth is, women who are &s;o puffed up with the conceit of talents as to neglect the plain duties of life, will not frequently be found to be women of
<PB N="10" REF="037996_0225_100FAB5109059200">
the be&s;t abilities. And here may the author be al|lowed the gratification of ob&s;erving, that tho&s;e wo|men of real genius and exten&s;ive knowledge, who&s;e friend&s;hip have conferred honour and happine&s;s on her own life, have been in general eminent for oeco|nomy, and the practice of dome&s;tic virtues; and greatly &s;uperior to the poor affectation of de&s;pi&s;ing the duties and the knowledge of common life.</P>
<P>A romantic girl with a preten&s;ion to &s;entiment, which her &s;till more ignorant friends mi&s;take for ge|nius, (for in the empire of the blind the one-eyed are kings) and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;omething of a natural ear, has perhaps in her childhood exhau&s;ted all the ima|ges of grief and love, and fancy, picked up in her de&s;ultory poetical reading, in an elegy on a &s;ick lin|net or a dead lap-dog; &s;he begins thence-forward to be con&s;idered as a prodigy in her little circle; &s;ur|rounded with flatterers, &s;he has no opportunity of getting to know that her &s;ame is derived not from her powers, but her po&s;ition; and that when an impartial critic &s;hall have made all the nece&s;&s;ary deductions, &s;uch as&mdash;that &s;he is a neighbour, that &s;he is a relation, that &s;he is a female, that &s;he is young, that &s;he has had no advantages, that &s;he is pretty perhaps&mdash;when her ver&s;es come to be &s;tripped of all their extraneous appendages, and the fair author is driven off her 'vantage-ground of partiality, &s;ex, and favour, &s;he will com|monly
<PB N="11" REF="037996_0226_100FAB54C06D9A98">
&s;ink to the level of ordinary capacities; while tho&s;e quieter women, who have meekly &s;at down in the humble &s;hades of pro&s;e and prudence, by a pa|tient per&s;everance in rational &s;tudies, ri&s;e afterwards much higher in the &s;cale of intellect, and acquire a &s;tock of &s;ound knowledge for far better purpo&s;es than mere di&s;play. And, though it may &s;eem a con|tradiction, yet it will generally be found true, that girls who take to &s;cribbling are the lea&s;t &s;tudious. They early acquire a fal&s;e confidence in their own una&s;&s;i&s;ted powers; it becomes more gratifying to their natural vanity to be always pouring out their minds on paper, than to be drawing into them fre&s;h ideas from richer &s;ources. The original &s;tock, &s;mall perhaps at fir&s;t, is &s;oon &s;pent; and the &s;ub&s;equent efforts grow more and more faint, if the mind which is continually exhau&s;ting it&s;elf, be not al&s;o continu|ally repleni&s;hed; till the latter compo&s;itions become little more than reproductions of the &s;ame images, a little varied and modified perhaps, and not a little diluted and enfeebled.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;elf-taught, and &s;elf-dependent &s;cribblers pant for the unmerited prai&s;e of fancy and of genius, while they di&s;dain the commendation of judgment, knowledge, and per&s;everance which would be with|in their reach. To extort admiration they are ac|cu&s;tomed to boa&s;t of an impo&s;&s;ible rapidity in compo&s;|ing; and while they in&s;inuate how little time their
<PB N="12" REF="037996_0227_100FAB5647E0E050">
performances co&s;t them, they intend you &s;hould in|fer how perfect they might have made them had they conde&s;cended to the drudgery of application. They take &s;uperfluous pains to convince you that there was neither learning nor labour employed in the work for which they &s;olicit your prai&s;e: the ju|dicious eye too &s;oon perceives it! though it does <HI>not</HI> perceive that native &s;trength and mother-wit, which in works of real genius make &s;ome amends for the negligence, which yet they do not ju&s;tify. But in|&s;tead of extolling the&s;e effu&s;ions for their facility, it would be kind in friends rather to blame them for their crudene&s;s: and when the young pretenders are eager to prove in how &s;hort a time &s;uch a poem has been &s;truck off, it would be well to regret that they had not either taken a longer time, or forborne from writing at all; as in the former ca&s;e the work would have been le&s;s defective, and in the latter the writer would have di&s;covered more humility and &s;elf-di&s;|tru&s;t.</P>
<P>A general capacity for knowledge, and the culti|vation of the under&s;tanding at large, will always put a woman into the be&s;t &s;tate for directing her pur&s;uits into tho&s;e particular channels which her de&s;tination in life may afterwards require. But &s;he &s;hould be carefully in&s;tructed that her talents are only means to a &s;till higher attainment, and that &s;he is not to re&s;t in them as an end; that merely to exerci&s;e them as
<PB N="13" REF="037996_0228_100FAB58E0BA7AA0">
in&s;truments for the acqui&s;ition of fame and the pro|moting of plea&s;ure, is &s;ubver&s;ive of her delicacy as a woman, and contrary to the &s;pirit of a chri&s;tian.</P>

<P>But there is one <HI>human</HI> con&s;ideration which would perhaps more effectually tend to damp in an a&s;piring woman the ardours of literary vanity (I &s;peak not of real genius) than any which &s;he will derive from motives of humility, or propriety, or religion; which is, that in the judgment pa&s;&s;ed on her performances, &s;he will have to encounter the mortifying circum|&s;tance of having her &s;ex always taken into account, and her highe&s;t exertions will probably be received with the qualified approbation, <HI>that it is really extra|ordinary for a woman.</HI> Men of learning, who are naturally inclined to e&s;timate works in proportion as

<P>As to men of &s;en&s;e, however, they need be the le&s;s inimical to the improvement of the other &s;ex, as they them&s;elves will be &s;ure to be gainers by it; the enlargement of the female under&s;tanding being the mo&s;t likely means to put an end to tho&s;e petty cavils and contentions for equality which female &s;matterers &s;o anxiou&s;ly maintain.

<P>There is this &s;ingular difference between a woman vain of her wit, and a woman vain of her beauty; that the beauty, while &s;he is anxiou&s;ly alive to her own fame, is often indifferent enough about the beau|ty of other women; and provided &s;he her&s;elf is &s;ure of your admiration, &s;he does not in&s;i&s;t on your think|ing that there is another hand&s;ome woman in the world: while &s;he who is vain of her genius, more liberal at lea&s;t in her vanity, is jealous for the ho|nour of her whole &s;ex, and contends for the equality of their preten&s;ions, in which &s;he feels that her own are involved.

<P>At the revival of letters in the &s;ixteenth and the following century, the controver&s;y about this equali|ty was agitated with more warmth than wi&s;dom; and the proce&s;s was in&s;tituted and carried on, on the part of the female complainant, with that &s;ort of acrimony which always rai&s;es a &s;u&s;picion of the ju&s;|tice of any cau&s;e. The novelty of that knowledge which was then bur&s;ting out from the dawn of a long dark night, kindled all the ardours of the female mind, and the ladies fought zealou&s;ly for a portion of that renown which the reputation of learning was beginning to be&s;tow. Be&s;ides their own pens, they had for their advocates all tho&s;e needy authors who had any thing to hope from their power, their riches, or their influence; and &s;o giddy did &s;ome of the&s;e li|terary ladies become by the adulation of their nume|rous panegyri&s;ts, that through the&s;e repeated draughts of inebriating prai&s;e, they grew to de&s;pi&s;e the equali|ty for which they had before contended, as a &s;tate below their merit and unworthy of their acceptance. They now &s;corned to litigate for what they al|ready thought they &s;o obviou&s;ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and no|thing &s;hort of the palm of &s;uperiority was at length con&s;idered as adequate to their growing claims. When court-ladies and prince&s;&s;es were the candidates,
<PB N="17" REF="037996_0232_100FAB638B63C580">
they could not long want champions to &s;upport their cau&s;e; by the&s;e champions female authorities were produced as if paramount to facts; quotations from the&s;e female authors were con&s;idered as proofs, and their point-blank a&s;&s;ertions &s;tood for &s;olid and irre|fragable arguments. In tho&s;e para&s;ites who offered this homage to female genius, the homage was there|fore the effect neither of truth, nor of ju&s;tice, nor of conviction. It aro&s;e rather out of gratitude, or it was a reciprocation of flattery; it was &s;ometimes va|nity, it was often di&s;tre&s;s, which prompted the adu|lation; it was the want of a patrone&s;s; it was the want of a dinner. When a lady, and e&s;pecially as it then often happened, when one who was noble or royal, &s;at with gratifying docility at the foot of a profe&s;&s;or's chair; when &s;he admired the philo&s;opher, or took upon her to protect the theologian, whom his rivals among his own &s;ex were tearing to pieces, what could the grateful profe&s;&s;or or delighted theo|logian do le&s;s in return than make the apotheo&s;is of her who had had the penetration to di&s;cern his merit and the &s;pirit to reward it?

<P>If we have denied them the talents which might lead them to excel as lawyers, they are pre&s;erved from the peril of having their principles warped by that too indi&s;criminate defence of right and wrong, to which the profe&s;&s;ors of the law are expo&s;ed. If we &s;hould que&s;tion their title to eminence as mathe|maticians, they are happily exempt from the danger to which men devoted to that &s;cience are &s;aid to be liable; namely, that of looking for demon&s;tration on &s;ubjects, which, by their very nature, are incapable of affording it. If they are le&s;s conver&s;ant in the

<P>And let the weaker &s;ex take comfort, that in their very exemption from privileges, which they are &s;ometimes di&s;po&s;ed to envy, con&s;i&s;ts their &s;ecurity and their happine&s;s. If they enjoy not the di&s;tinc|tions of public life and high offices, do they not e&s;cape the re&s;pon&s;ibility attached to them, and the mortification of being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from them? If they have no voice in deliberative a&s;&s;emblies, do they not avoid the load of duty connected with &s;uch privileges? Prepo&s;terous pains have been taken to excite in wo|men an unea&s;y jealou&s;y, that their talents are neither rewarded with public honours nor emoluments in life; nor with in&s;criptions, &s;tatues, and mau&s;oleums after death. It has been ab&s;urdly repre&s;ented to them as a hard&s;hip, that while they are expected to perform duties, they mu&s;t yet be contented to relin|qui&s;h

<P>Though it be one main object of this little work, rather to lower than to rai&s;e any de&s;ire of celebrity in the female heart; yet I would awaken it to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;ibility to hone&s;t fame: I would call on women to reflect that our religion has not only made them heirs to a ble&s;&s;ed immortality hereafter, but has greatly rai&s;ed them in the &s;cale of being here, by lifting them to an importance in &s;ociety unknown to the mo&s;t poli&s;hed ages of antiquity. The religion of Chri&s;t has even be&s;towed a degree of renown on the &s;ex beyond what any other religion ever did. Per|haps there are hardly &s;o many virtuous women (for I reject the long catalogue whom their vices have transferred from oblivion to infamy) named in all the pages of Greek or Roman Hi&s;tory, as are handed down to eternal fame, in a few of tho&s;e &s;hort chap|ters with which the great Apo&s;tle to the Gentiles has concluded his epi&s;tles to his converts. Of "devout and honourable women," the &s;acred &s;crip|tures record "not a few."

<ARGUMENT>
<P>CONVERSATION.&mdash;Hints &s;ugge&s;ted on the &s;ubject.&mdash;On the tempers and di&s;po&s;itions to be introduced in it.&mdash;Er|rors to be avoided.&mdash;Vanity under various &s;hapes the cau&s;e of tho&s;e errors.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE &s;exes will naturally de&s;ire to appear to each other, &s;uch as each believes the other will be&s;t like; their conver&s;ation will act reciprocally; and each &s;ex will appear more or le&s;s rational as they perceive it will more or le&s;s recommend them to the other. It is therefore to be regretted, that many men, even of di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;en&s;e and learning, are &s;o apt to con&s;i|der the &s;ociety of ladies, as a &s;cene in which to re&s;t their under&s;tandings, rather than to exerci&s;e them; while ladies in return, are too much addicted to make their court by lending them&s;elves to this &s;pirit of tri|fling; they often avoid to make u&s;e of what abilities they have; and affect to talk below their natural and acquired powers of mind; con&s;idering it as a tacit and welcome flattery to the under&s;tanding of men, to re|nounce the exerci&s;e of their own.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="037996_0250_100FAB94B3152600">
Now &s;ince ta&s;tes and principles thus mutually ope|rate; men, by keeping up conver&s;ation to its proper &s;tandard, would not only call into exerci&s;e the pow|ers of mind which women actually po&s;&s;e&s;s; but would even awaken in them new energies which they do not know they po&s;&s;e&s;s; and men of &s;en&s;e would find their account in doing this, for their own talents would be more highly rated by companions who were better able to appreciate them. And, on the other hand, if young women found it did not often re|commend them in the eyes of tho&s;e whom they might wi&s;h to plea&s;e, to be frivolous and &s;uperficial, they would become more &s;edulous in correcting their own habits; whenever fa&s;hionable women indicate a reli&s;h for in&s;tructive conver&s;ation, men will not be apt to hazard what is vain or unprofitable; much le&s;s will they ever pre&s;ume to bring forward what is loo&s;e or corrupt, where &s;ome &s;ignal has not been previou&s;ly given, that it will be acceptable, or at lea&s;t that it will be pardoned.</P>
<P>Ladies commonly bring into company minds al|ready too much relaxed by petty pur&s;uits, rather than over&s;trained by inten&s;e application; the littlene&s;s of the employments in which they are u&s;ually engaged, does not &s;o exhau&s;t their &s;pirits as to make them &s;tand in need of that relaxation from company which &s;evere application or overwhelming bu&s;ine&s;s makes requi&s;ite for &s;tudious or public men. The due con|&s;ideration
<PB N="36" REF="037996_0251_100FAB97569EE4C0">
of this circum&s;tance might &s;erve to bring the &s;exes more nearly on a level in &s;ociety; and each might meet the other half way; for that degree of lively and ea&s;y conver&s;ation which is a nece&s;&s;ary re|fre&s;hment to the learned and the bu&s;y, would not de|crea&s;e in plea&s;antne&s;s by being made of &s;o rational a ca&s;t as would yet &s;omewhat rai&s;e the minds of wo|men, who commonly &s;eek &s;ociety as a &s;cene of plea|&s;ure, not as a refuge from inten&s;e thought or exhau&s;t|ing labour.</P>
<P>It is a di&s;advantage even to tho&s;e women who keep the be&s;t company, that it is unhappily almo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed into a &s;y&s;tem, by the other &s;ex, to po&s;t|pone every thing like in&s;tructive di&s;cour&s;e till the la|dies are withdrawn; their retreat &s;erving as a kind of &s;ignal for the exerci&s;e of intellect. And in the few ca&s;es in which it happens that any important di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion takes place in their pre&s;ence, they are for the mo&s;t part con&s;idered as having little intere&s;t in &s;eri|ous &s;ubjects. Strong truths, whenever &s;uch happen to be addre&s;&s;ed to them, are either diluted with flat|tery, or kept back in part, or &s;oftened to their ta&s;te; or if the ladies expre&s;s a wi&s;h for information on any point, they are put off with a compliment, in&s;tead of a rea&s;on; and are con&s;idered as beings who are not expected to &s;ee and to judge of things as they really exi&s;t.</P>

<P>It is too well known how much the dread of im|puted pedantry keeps off any thing that verges to|wards <HI>learned,</HI> and the terror of imputed enthu&s;ia&s;m, &s;taves off any thing that approaches to <HI>&s;erious</HI> con|ver&s;ation, &s;o that the two topics which peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;h us, as rational and immortal beings, are by general con&s;ent in a good degree bani&s;hed from the &s;ociety of rational and immortal creatures.

drowned, as relinqui&s;h the enjoyments of intellectual, and the ble&s;&s;ings of religious intercour&s;e, becau&s;e the learned world has &s;ometimes been infe&s;ted with pe|dants, and the religious world with fanatics.</P>
<P>As in the momentous times in which we live, it is next to impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s an evening in company, but the talk will &s;o inevitably revert to politics, that, without any premeditated de&s;ign, every one pre&s;ent &s;hall infallibly get to know to which &s;ide the other inclines; why, in the far higher concern of eternal things, &s;hould we &s;o carefully &s;hun every offered opportunity of bearing even a ca&s;ual te&s;timony to the part we e&s;pou&s;e in religion? Why, while we make it a &s;ort of point of con&s;cience to leave no doubt on the mind of a &s;tranger, whether we adopt the party of Pitt or Fox, &s;hall we choo&s;e to leave it very pro|blematical whether we belong to God or Baal? Why, in religion, as well as in politics, &s;hould we not act like people who, having their all at &s;take, cannot forbear now and then adverting for a mo|ment to the object of their grand concern, and drop|ping, at lea&s;t, an incidental intimation of the &s;ide to which they belong.</P>
<P>Even the news of the day, in &s;uch an eventful period as the pre&s;ent, may lend frequent occa&s;ions to a woman of principle, to declare, without parade, her faith in a moral Governor of the world; her tru&s;t in a particular Providence; her belief in the
<PB N="40" REF="037996_0255_100FABA0D7DC98C8">
Divine Omnipotence; her confidence in the power of God, in educing good from evil, in his employ|ing wicked nations, not as favourites but in&s;tru|ments; her per&s;ua&s;ion that pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;s is no proof of the divine favour; in &s;hort, &s;ome intimation that &s;he is not a&s;hamed to declare that her mind is under the influence of chri&s;tian faith and principle. A general concurrence in exhibiting this &s;pirit of de|cided faith and holy tru&s;t, would inconceivably di&s;|courage that pert infidelity which is ever on the watch to produce it&s;elf: and, as we have already ob&s;erved, if women, who derive authority from their rank or talents, did but reflect how their &s;entiments are repeated and their authority quoted, they would be &s;o on their guard, that general &s;ociety might be|come a &s;cene of general improvement, and the young, who are looking for models on which to fa&s;hion them&s;elves, would be a&s;hamed of exhibiting any thing like levity, or &s;ceptici&s;m, or profanene&s;s.</P>
<P>Let it be under&s;tood, that it is not meant to inti|mate that &s;erious &s;ubjects &s;hould make up the bulk of conver&s;ation; this, as it is impo&s;&s;ible, would al&s;o often be improper. It is not intended to &s;ugge&s;t that they &s;hould be abruptly introduced, or un&s;uita|bly prolonged; but only that they &s;hould not be &s;y&s;tematically &s;hunned, nor the brand of fanatici&s;m be fixed on the per&s;on who, with whatever proprie|ty, hazards the introduction of them. It is evident,
<PB N="41" REF="037996_0256_100FABA380EC6788">
however, that this general dread of &s;erious topics ari&s;es a good deal from an ignorance of the true na|ture of religion; people avoid it on the principle expre&s;&s;ed by the vulgar phra&s;e of the danger of play|ing with edge tools. They conceive of it as &s;ome|thing which involves controver&s;y, and di&s;pute, and mi&s;chief; &s;omething of an inflammatory nature, which is to &s;tir up ill humours; as of a &s;ort of party bu&s;ine&s;s which &s;ets friends at variance. So much is this notion adopted, that I have &s;een announced two works of con&s;iderable merit, in which it was &s;tipulated as an attraction, that religion, as being likely to excite anger and party di&s;tinctions, &s;hould be carefully excluded. Such is the worldly idea of the &s;pirit of that religion, who&s;e direct object it was to bring "peace and good will to men!"</P>
<P>Women too little live or conver&s;e up to their un|der&s;tandings; and however we have deprecated af|fectation or pedantry, let it be remembered, that both in reading and conver&s;ing the under&s;tanding gains more by &s;tretching, than &s;tooping. If by ex|erting it&s;elf it may not attain to all it de&s;ires, yet it will be &s;ure to gain &s;omething. The mind, by al|ways applying it&s;elf to objects below its level, con|tracts and &s;hrinks it&s;elf to the &s;ize, and lowers it&s;elf to the level, of the object about which it is conver|&s;ant: while the mind which is active expands and
<PB N="42" REF="037996_0257_100FABA643CAF280">
rai&s;es it&s;elf, grows larger by exerci&s;e, abler by diffu|&s;ion, and richer by communication.</P>
<P>But the ta&s;te of general &s;ociety is not favourable to improvement. The &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s with which the mo&s;t frivolous &s;ubjects are agitated, and the levity with which the mo&s;t &s;erious are di&s;patched, bear a pretty exact proportion to each other. Society too is a &s;ort of magic lanthorn; the &s;cene is perpetually &s;hift|ing. In this ince&s;&s;ant change, the evane&s;cent fa&s;hion of the pre&s;ent minute, which, while in many it leads to the cultivation of real knowledge, has al&s;o &s;ome|times led even the gay and idle to the affection of mixing a &s;prinkling of &s;cience with the ma&s;s of di&s;&s;i|pation. The ambition of appearing to be well-in|formed breaks out even in tho&s;e triflers who will not &s;pare time from their plea&s;urable pur&s;uits &s;ufficient for acquiring that knowledge, of which, however, the reputation is &s;o de&s;irable. A little &s;mattering of philo&s;ophy often dignifies the pur&s;uits of the day, without re&s;cuing them from the vanities of the night. A cour&s;e of lectures (that admirable a&s;&s;i&s;tant for en|lightening the under&s;tanding) is not &s;eldom re&s;orted to as a means to &s;ub&s;titute the appearance of know|ledge for the fatigue of application; but where this valuable help is attended merely like any other pub|lic exhibition, and is not furthered by corre&s;pondent reading at home, it often &s;erves to &s;et off the reality of ignorance with the affectation of &s;kill. But in|&s;tead
<PB N="43" REF="037996_0258_100FABA9F1648030">
of producing in conver&s;ation a few reigning &s;cientific terms, with a familiarity and readine&s;s, which
<Q><L>Amaze the unlearn'd, and make the learned &s;mile,</L></Q>
would it not be more mode&s;t even for tho&s;e who are better informed, to avoid the common u&s;e of techni|cal terms whenever the idea can be as well conveyed without them? For it argues no real ability to know the <HI>names</HI> of tools; the ability lies in knowing their <HI>u&s;e:</HI> and while it is in the thing, and not in the term, that real knowledge con&s;i&s;ts, the charge of pedantry is attached to the u&s;e of the term, which would not at|tach to the knowledge of the &s;cience.</P>
<P>In the faculty of &s;peaking well, ladies have &s;uch a happy promptitude of turning their &s;lender advantages to account, that there are many who, though they have never been taught a rule of &s;yntax, yet, by a quick facility in profiting from the be&s;t books and the be&s;t company, hardly ever violate one; and who often exhibit an elegant and per&s;picuous arrangement of &s;tyle, without having &s;tudied any of the laws of compo&s;ition. Every kind of knowledge which ap|pears to be the re&s;ult of ob&s;ervation, reflection, and natural ta&s;te, &s;its gracefully on women. Yet on the other hand it &s;ometimes happens, that ladies of no contemptible natural parts are too ready to produce, not only pedantic expre&s;&s;ions, but crude notions; and &s;till oftener to bring forward obvious and hackneyed
<PB N="44" REF="037996_0259_100FABAB78754EE0">
remarks, which float on the very &s;urface of a &s;ub|ject, with the impo&s;ing air of recent invention, and all the vanity of con&s;cious di&s;covery. This is be|cau&s;e their acquirements have not been woven into their minds by early in&s;truction; what knowledge they have gotten &s;tands out as it were above the very &s;urface of their minds, like the <HI>appliqu&eacute;e</HI> of the em|broiderer, in&s;tead of having been interwoven with the growth of the piece, &s;o as to have become a part of the &s;tuff. They did not, like men, acquire what they know while the texture was forming. Perhaps no better preventive could be devi&s;ed for this literary vanity, than <HI>early</HI> in&s;truction: that woman would be le&s;s likely to be vain of her knowledge who did not remember the time when &s;he was ignorant.

<P>Their reading al&s;o has probably con&s;i&s;ted much in abridgments from larger works, as was ob&s;erved in a former chapter; this makes a readier talker, but a &s;hallower thinker, than the peru&s;al of books of more bulk.

and an important &s;ubject is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without di&s;cu&s;&s;i|on, by this incon&s;equent flippancy and voluble ra&s;h|ne&s;s.

<P>For, if the great Roman Orator could ob&s;erve, that &s;ilence was &s;o important a part of conver&s;ation, that "there was not only an art but an eloquence in it," how peculiarly does the remark apply to the mode&s;|ty of youthful females! But the &s;ilence of li&s;tle&s;s ignorance, and the &s;ilence of &s;parkling intelligence, are two things almo&s;t as obviou&s;ly di&s;tinct, as the wi&s;dom and the folly of the tongue. An inviolable and marked attention may &s;hew, that a woman is plea&s;ed with a &s;ubject, and an illuminated counte|nance may prove that &s;he under&s;tands it, almo&s;t as unequivocally as language it&s;elf could do; and this, with a mode&s;t que&s;tion, is in many ca&s;es as large a &s;hare of the conver&s;ation as it is decorous for femi|nine delicacy to take. It is al&s;o as flattering an en|couragement as men of &s;en&s;e require, for pur&s;uing &s;uch topics in the pre&s;ence of women, which they would be more di&s;po&s;ed to do, did they oftener gain by it the attention which it is natural to wi&s;h to ex|cite.</P>
<P>Yet do we not &s;ometimes &s;ee an impatience to be heard (nor is it a <HI>feminine</HI> failing only) which good

breeding can &s;carcely &s;ubdue? And even when the&s;e incorrigible talkers are compelled to be &s;ilent, is it not evident that they are not li&s;tening to what is &s;aid, but are only thinking of what they them&s;elves &s;hall &s;ay when they can &s;eize the fir&s;t lucky interval for which they are &s;o narrowly watching?</P>
<P>But conver&s;ation mu&s;t not be con&s;idered as a &s;tage for the di&s;play of our talents, &s;o much as a field for the exerci&s;e and improvement of our virtues; as a means for promoting the glory of our Creator, and the good and happine&s;s of our fellow creatures. Well-bred and intelligent Chri&s;tians are not, when they join in &s;ociety, to con&s;ider them&s;elves as enter|ing the li&s;ts like intellectual prize-fighters, in order to exhibit their own vigour and dexterity, to di&s;com|fit their adver&s;ary, and to bear away the palm of victory. Truth and not triumph &s;hould be the ob|ject; and there are few occa&s;ions in life, in which we are more unremittingly called upon to watch our|&s;elves narrowly, and to re&s;i&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of various temptations, than in conver&s;ation. Vanity, jealou&s;y, envy, mi&s;repre&s;entation, re&s;entment, di&s;dain, levity, impatience, in&s;incerity, will in turn &s;olicit to be gra|tified. Con&s;tantly to &s;truggle again&s;t the de&s;ire of being thought more wi&s;e, more witty, and more knowing, than tho&s;e with whom we a&s;&s;ociate, de|mands the ince&s;&s;ant exertion of Chri&s;tian vigilance, a vigilance which the generality are &s;o far from &s;u&s;|pecting
<PB N="52" REF="037996_0267_100FABC1056C88D8">
nece&s;&s;ary in the intercour&s;e of common &s;ociety, that cheerful conver&s;ation is rather con&s;idered as an exemption and relea&s;e from it, than as an additional obligation to it.</P>
<P>But &s;ociety, as was ob&s;erved before, is not a &s;tage on which to throw down our gauntlet, and prove our own prowe&s;s by the number of falls we give to our adver&s;ary; &s;o far from it, good breeding as well as Chri&s;tianity, con&s;iders as an indi&s;pen&s;able requi&s;ite for conver&s;ation, the di&s;po&s;ition to bring forward to notice any talent in others, which their own mode&s;ty, or con&s;cious inferiority would lead them to keep back. To do this with effect requires a penetration exerci&s;ed to di&s;cern merit, and a gene|rous candour which delights in drawing it out. There are few who cannot conver&s;e tolerably on &s;ome one topic; what that is, we &s;hould try to find out, and in general introduce that topic, though to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of any one on which we our&s;elves are &s;uppo&s;ed to excel: and however &s;uperior we may be in other re&s;pects to the per&s;ons in que&s;tion, we may, perhaps, in that particular point, improve by them; and if we do not gain information, we &s;hall at lea&s;t gain a whole&s;ome exerci&s;e to our humility and &s;elf-denied; we &s;hall be re&s;training our own im|petuo&s;ity; we &s;hall, if we take this cour&s;e on ju&s;t occa&s;ions only, and &s;o as to beware le&s;t we gratify the vanity of others, be giving confidence to a doubt|ing

or cheerfulne&s;s to a depre&s;&s;ed &s;pirit. And to place a ju&s;t remark, hazarded by the diffident, in the mo&s;t advantageous point of view; to call the at|tention of the inattentive, the forward and the &s;elf-&s;ufficient, to &s;ome quiet per&s;on in the company, who though of much worth, is perhaps of little note; the&s;e are requi&s;ites for conver&s;ation, le&s;s brilliant, but far more valuable, than the power of exciting bur&s;ts of laughter by the brighte&s;t wit, or of extort|ing admiration by the mo&s;t poignant &s;allies of ridi|cule.</P>
<P>For wit is of all the qualities of the female mind that which requires the &s;evere&s;t ca&s;tigation; yet the temperate exerci&s;e of this fa&s;cinating quality throws an additional lu&s;tre round the character of an amia|ble woman; for to manage with di&s;creet mode&s;ty a dangerous talent, confers a higher prai&s;e than can be claimed by tho&s;e in whom the ab&s;ence of the talent takes away the temptation to mi&s;employ it. To wo|men, wit is a peculiarly perilous po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which nothing &s;hort of the &s;obermindedne&s;s of Chri&s;tianity can keep in order. Intemperate wit craves admirati|on as its natural aliment; it lives on flattery as its daily bread. The profe&s;&s;ed wit is a hungry beggar, that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts on the extorted alms of perpetual pane|gyric; and like the vulture in the Grecian fable, its appetite increa&s;es by indulgence. Simple truth and &s;ober approbation become ta&s;tele&s;s and in&s;ipid to the
<PB N="54" REF="037996_0269_100FABC6ABE42908">
palate, daily vitiated by the delicious poignancies of exaggerated commendation. Under the above re|&s;trictions, however, wit may be &s;afely and plea&s;ant|ly exerci&s;ed; for <HI>cha&s;ti&s;ed wit</HI> is an elegant and well-bred, and not unfeminine quality. But <HI>humour,</HI> e&s;|pecially if it degenerate into imitation, or mimicry, is very &s;paringly to be ventured on; for it is &s;o dif|ficult totally to detach it from the &s;u&s;picion of buf|foonery, that a woman will be likely to lo&s;e more of that delicacy which is her appropriate grace, than &s;he will gain in the eyes of the judicious, by the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful di&s;play of humour.</P>
<P>But if it be true that &s;ome women are too apt to affect brilliancy and di&s;play in their own di&s;cour&s;e, and to undervalue the more humble preten&s;ions of le&s;s &s;howy characters; it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed al&s;o, that &s;ome of more ordinary abilities are now and then guilty of the oppo&s;ite error, and fooli&s;hly af|fect to value them&s;elves on not making u&s;e of the under&s;tanding they really po&s;&s;e&s;s. They exhibit no &s;mall &s;atisfaction in ridiculing women of high intel|lectual endowments, while they exclaim with much affected humility, and much real envy, that <Q>they are thankful <HI>they</HI> are not geniu&s;es.</Q> Now, though one is glad to hear gratitude expre&s;&s;ed on any occa|&s;ion, yet the want of &s;en&s;e is really no &s;uch great mercy to be thankful for; and it would indicate a better &s;pirit, were they to pray to be enabled to make
<PB N="55" REF="037996_0270_100FABCA5ACC5DE8">
a right u&s;e of the moderate under&s;tanding they po&s;|&s;e&s;s, in&s;tead of expo&s;ing with a vi&s;ible plea&s;ure the imaginary or real defects of their more &s;hining ac|quaintance. Women of the brighte&s;t faculties &s;hould not only "bear tho&s;e faculties meekly," but con&s;ider it as no derogation, cheerfully to fulfil tho&s;e humbler duties which make up the bu&s;ine&s;s of common life, always taking into the account the higher re&s;pon&s;ibility attached to higher gifts. While women of lower attainments &s;hould exert to the ut|mo&s;t &s;uch abilities as Providence has a&s;&s;igned them; and while they &s;hould not deride excellencies which are above their reach, they &s;hould not de&s;pond at an inferiority which did not depend on them&s;elves; nor, becau&s;e God has denied them ten talents, &s;hould they forget that they are equally re&s;pon&s;ible for the one he <HI>has</HI> allotted them, but &s;et about de|voting that one with humble diligence to the glory of the Giver.</P>
<P>Vanity, however, is not the monopoly of talents: let not a young lady, therefore, fancy that &s;he is humble, merely becau&s;e &s;he is not ingenious. Hu|mility is not the exclu&s;ive privilege of dulne&s;s. Fol|ly is as conceited as wit, and ignorance many a time out&s;trips knowledge in the race of vanity. Equal|ly earne&s;t competitions &s;pring from cau&s;es le&s;s wor|thy to excite them than wit and genius. Vanity in&s;inuates it&s;elf into the female heart under a variety
<PB N="56" REF="037996_0271_100FABCBE6805A90">
of un&s;u&s;pected forms, and &s;eizes on many a little pa&s;s which was not thought worth guarding.</P>
<P>Who has not &s;een as re&s;tle&s;s emotion agitate the features of an anxious matron, while peace and fame hung trembling in doubtful &s;u&s;pen&s;e on the &s;ucce&s;s of a &s;oup or a &s;auce, on which &s;entence was about to be pronounced by &s;ome con&s;ummate critic, as could have been excited by any competition for lite|rary renown, or any &s;truggle for conte&s;ted wit? Nor was the illu&s;trious hero of Greece more effec|tually hindered from &s;leeping by the trophies of Miltiades, than many a modi&s;h dam&s;el by the eclip&s;|ing &s;uperiority of &s;ome newer decoration exhibited by her more &s;ucce&s;ful friend.</P>
<P>There is another &s;pecies of vanity in &s;ome women which di&s;gui&s;es it&s;elf under the thin veil of an af|fected humility; they will accu&s;e them&s;elves of &s;ome fault from which they are remarkably exempt, and lament the want of &s;ome talent which they are rather notorious for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. This is not only a clum&s;y trap for prai&s;e, but there is a di&s;ingenuous intention, by renouncing a quality they eminently po&s;&s;e&s;s, to gain credit for others in which they are really defi|cient. All affectation involves a &s;pecies of deceit. The Apo&s;tle when he enjoins, <Q>not to think of our|&s;elves more highly than we ought,</Q> does not ex|hort us to think <HI>fal&s;ely</HI> of our&s;elves, but to think "&s;oberly;" and it is worth ob&s;erving that in this in|junction
<PB N="57" REF="037996_0272_100FABCEDC7E6730">
he does not u&s;e the word <HI>&s;peak,</HI> but <HI>think,</HI> inferring po&s;&s;ibly, that it would be &s;afer to <HI>&s;peak</HI> lit|tle of our&s;elves or not at all; for it is &s;o far from be|ing an unequivocal proof of our humility to talk even of our defects, that while we make <HI>&s;elf</HI> the &s;ubject, in whatever way, &s;elf-love contrives to be gratified, and will even be content that our faults &s;hould be talked of, rather than that we &s;hould not be talked of at all. Some are al&s;o attacked with &s;uch proud fits of humility, that while they are ready to accu&s;e them&s;elves of almo&s;t every &s;in in the lump, they yet take fire at the imputation of the &s;lighte&s;t <HI>individual</HI> fault; and in&s;tantly enter upon their own vindication as warmly as if you and not them&s;elves, had brought forward the charge. The truth is, they ventured to condemn them&s;elves, in the full confidence that you would contradict them; the la&s;t thing they intended was that you &s;hould believe them, and they are ne|ver &s;o much piqued and di&s;appointed as when they are taken at their word.</P>
<P>Of the various &s;hapes and undefined forms into which vanity branches out in conver&s;ation, there is no end. Out of a re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire to plea&s;e, grows the &s;purious de&s;ire to a&s;toni&s;h: from vanity as much as from credulity, ari&s;es that &s;trong love of the marvellous, with which the conver&s;ation of the ill-educated abounds. Hence that fondne&s;s for dealing in narratives hardly within the compa&s;s of po&s;&s;ibility.

Here vanity has many &s;hades of gratification; tho&s;e &s;hades will be &s;tronger or weaker, whether the re|later chance to have been an eye-witne&s;s of the won|der &s;he recounts; or whether &s;he claim only the &s;e|cond-hand renown of its having happened to her friend, or the &s;till remoter celebrity of its having been witne&s;&s;ed only by her friend's friend: but even though that friend only knew the man, who remem|bered the woman, who actually beheld the thing which is now cau&s;ing admiration in the company, &s;till <HI>&s;elf,</HI> though in a fainter degree, is brought into notice, and the relater contrives in &s;ome circuitous way to be connected with the wonder.</P>

There is another &s;hape, and a very deformed &s;hape it is, in which loquacious vanity &s;hews it&s;elf; I mean, the betraying of confidence.

The &s;ecret would be of little value, if the revealing it did not &s;erve to intimate <HI>our</HI> connexion with it; the plea&s;ure of its having been depo&s;ited with us would be nothing, if others may not know it has been &s;o depo&s;ited.&mdash;When we con|tinue to &s;ee the variety of &s;erious evils this principle involves, &s;hall we per&s;i&s;t in a&s;&s;erting that vanity is a &s;lender mi&s;chief?</P>
<P>There is one offence committed in conver&s;ation of much too &s;erious a nature to be overlooked, or to be animadverted on without &s;orrow and indignation: I mean, the habitual and thoughtle&s;s profanene&s;s of tho&s;e who are repeatedly invoking their Maker's name on occa&s;ions the mo&s;t trivial. It is offen&s;ive in all its variety of a&s;pects;&mdash;it is very pernicious in its <HI>effects;</HI>&mdash;it is a <HI>growing</HI> evil;&mdash;tho&s;e who are mo&s;t guilty of it, are from habit hardly con&s;cious

when they do it; are not aware of the &s;in; and for both the&s;e rea&s;ons, without the admonitions of faith|ful friend&s;hip, little likely to di&s;continue it.&mdash;It is ut|terly INEXCUSABLE;&mdash;it has none of the palliatives of <HI>temptation</HI> which other vices plead, and in that re|&s;pect &s;tands di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others both in its nature and degree of guilt.&mdash;Like many other &s;ins, however, it is at once cau&s;e and effect; it <HI>proceeds</HI> from want of love and reverence to the be&s;t of Beings, and <HI>cau&s;es</HI> that want both in them&s;elves and others. Yet with all tho&s;e aggravations, there is, perhaps, hardly any &s;in &s;o frequently committed, &s;o &s;eldom repented of, and &s;o little guarded again&s;t.

<P>I would endeavour to give &s;ome faint idea of the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of this offence, by an analogy (oh! how inadequate!) with which the feeling heart, even though not &s;ea&s;oned with religion, may be touched.

Does not your affec|tionate heart recoil at the thought? And yet the hallowed name of your true&s;t Benefactor, your heavenly Father, your be&s;t Friend, who gives you all you enjoy, tho&s;e very friends in whom you &s;o much delight, tho&s;e very organs with which you di&s;honour him, is treated with an irreverence, a con|tempt, a wantonne&s;s, with which you cannot bear the very thought or mention of treating a human friend. His name is impiou&s;ly, is unfeelingly, is ungratefully &s;ingled out as the object of decided irreverence, of &s;y&s;tematic contempt, of thoughtle&s;s levity.

<P>Among the deep, but le&s;s obvious mi&s;chiefs of conver&s;ation, <HI>mi&s;repre&s;entation</HI> mu&s;t not be overlook|ed. Self-love is continually at work, to give to all we &s;ay a bias in our own favour. The counterac|tion of this fault &s;hould be &s;et about in the earlie&s;t &s;tages of education. If young per&s;ons have not been di&s;couraged in the natural, but evil, propen&s;ity to relate every di&s;pute they have had with others to their own advantage; if they have not been trained to the duty of doing ju&s;tice even to tho&s;e with whom they are at variance; if they have not been led to aim at a complete impartiality in their little narratives, and in&s;tructed never to take advantage of the ab&s;ence of the other party, in order to make the &s;tory lean to their own &s;ide more than the truth will admit; how &s;hall we in advanced life look for correct habits, for unprejudiced repre&s;entations, for fidelity, accu|racy, and unbia&s;&s;ed ju&s;tice?</P>
<P>Yet, how often in &s;ociety, otherwi&s;e re&s;pectable, are we pained with narrations in which prejudice warps, and &s;elf-love blinds!

There is an affectation of candour, which is almo&s;t as mi&s;|chievous as calumny it&s;elf; nay, if it be le&s;s injuri|ous in its individual application, it is, perhaps, more alarming in its general principle, as it lays wa&s;te the &s;trong fences which &s;eparate good from evil. They know (though they &s;ometimes calumniate) that ca|lumny is wrong; but they have not been told that flattery is wrong al&s;o; and youth, being apt to fancy that the direct contrary to wrong mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be right, are apt to be driven into violent extremes. The dread of being only &s;u&s;pected of one fault, makes them actually guilty of the other; and to avoid the charge of har&s;hne&s;s or of envy, they plunge into in|&s;incerity.

maliciou&s;ly inventing occa&s;ions which may lead her to expo&s;e or betray it; but give as favourable a turn as you can to the follies which appear, and kindly help her to keep the re&s;t out of &s;ight. Never gratify your own humour, by hazarding what you &s;u&s;pect may wound any one pre&s;ent in their per&s;ons, connec|tions, profe&s;&s;ions in life, or religious opinions; and do not forget to examine whether the laugh your wit has rai&s;ed be never bought at this expence. Give credit to tho&s;e who, without your kindne&s;s, will get none; do not talk <HI>at</HI> any one whom you dare not talk <HI>to,</HI> unle&s;s from motives in which the golden rule will bear you out.

Remember al&s;o, that true good nature is the &s;oul, of which politene&s;s is only the garb.

<P>On the danger of an ill-directed Sen&s;ibility.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN con&s;idering the human character with a view to its improvement, it is prudent to endeavour to di&s;co|ver the natural bent of the mind, and having found it, to direct your force again&s;t that &s;ide on which the warp lies, that you may le&s;&s;en by counteraction the defect which you might be promoting, by applying your aid in a contrary direction. But the misfortune is, people who mean better than they judge, are apt to take up a &s;et of general rules, good perhaps in them&s;elves, and originally gleaned from experience and ob&s;ervation on the nature of human things, but not applicable in all ca&s;es. The&s;e rules they keep by them as no&s;trums of univer&s;al efficacy, which they therefore often bring out for u&s;e in ca&s;es to which they do not apply. For to make any reme|dy effectual, it is not enough to know the medicine, you mu&s;t &s;tudy the con&s;titution al&s;o; if there be not a congruity between the two, you may be in|juring one patient by the means which are requi&s;ite to rai&s;e and re&s;tore another, who&s;e temperament is of a contrary de&s;cription.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="037996_0287_100FABF3413BA898">
It is of importance in forming the female charac|ter, that tho&s;e on whom this ta&s;k devolves &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o much penetration as accurately to di&s;cern the degree of &s;en&s;ibility, and &s;o much judgment as to accommodate the treatment to the individual charac|ter. By con&s;tantly &s;timulating and extolling feelings naturally quick, tho&s;e feelings will be rendered too acute and irritable. On the other hand, a calm and equable temper will become obtu&s;e by the total want of excitement; the former treatment converts the feelings into a &s;ource of error, agitation and calami|ty; the latter &s;tarves their native energy, deadens the affections, and produces a cold, dull, &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit; for the human mind is an in&s;trument which will lo&s;e its &s;weetne&s;s if &s;trained too high, and will be deprived of its tone and &s;trength if not &s;ufficiently, rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is cruel to chill the precious &s;en&s;ibility of an in|genuous &s;oul, by treating with &s;upercilious coldne&s;s and unfeeling ridicule every indication of a warm, tender, di&s;intere&s;ted, and enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit, as if it exhibited &s;ymptoms of a deficiency in under&s;tanding or prudence. How many are apt to intimate, with a &s;mile of mingled pity and contempt, that when &s;uch a one knows the world, that is, in other words, when &s;he &s;hall be grown cunning, &s;elfi&s;h, and &s;u&s;pi|cious, &s;he will be a&s;hamed of her pre&s;ent glow of hone&s;t warmth, and of her lovely &s;u&s;ceptibility of

heart. May &s;he never know the world, if the know|ledge of it mu&s;t be acquired at &s;uch an expence! But to &s;en&s;ible hearts, every indication of genuine feeling will be dear, for they will know that it is this temper which, by the guidance of the Divine &s;pirit, may make her one day become more enamoured of the beauty of holine&s;s; which, with the co-opera|tion of principle, and under its direction, will render her the lively agent of Providence in dimini&s;hing the mi&s;ery that is in the world; into which mi&s;ery this temper will give her a quicker intuition than colder characters po&s;&s;e&s;s. It is this temper which, when it is touched and purified by a <Q>live coal from the altar,</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah, vi. 6.</NOTE> will give her a keener ta&s;te for the &s;pirit of religion, and a quicker zeal in di&s;charging its du|ties. But let it be remembered likewi&s;e, that as there is no quality in the female character which will be &s;o likely to endanger the peace, and to expo&s;e the virtue of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; &s;o there is none which re|quires to have its luxuriances more carefully watch|ed, and its wild &s;hoots more clo&s;ely lopped.</P>
<P>For young women of affections naturally warm, but not carefully di&s;ciplined, are in danger of incur|ring an unnatural irritability; and while their happi|ne&s;s falls a victim to the exce&s;s of uncontrolled feel|ings, they are liable at the &s;ame time to indulge a

vanity of all others the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous, that of being vain of their very defect. They have heard &s;en&s;ibility highly commended, without having heard any thing of tho&s;e bounds and fences which were intended to confine it, and without having been im|bued with that principle which would have given it a beneficial direction; con&s;cious that they po&s;&s;e&s;s the quality it&s;elf in the extreme, and not aware that they want all that makes that quality &s;afe and de|lightful, they plunge headlong into tho&s;e &s;ins and mi&s;eries from which they conceitedly imagine, that not principle but coldne&s;s has pre&s;erved the more &s;ober-minded and well-in&s;tructed of their &s;ex.</P>
<P>But as it would be foreign to the pre&s;ent de&s;ign to expatiate on tho&s;e criminal exce&s;&s;es which are &s;ome of the &s;ad effects of ungoverned pa&s;&s;ion, it is only intended here to hazard a few remarks on tho&s;e lighter con&s;equences of it, which con&s;i&s;t in the lo&s;s of comfort without ruin of character, and the privation of much of the happine&s;s of life without involving any very cen&s;urable degree of guilt or di&s;|credit. Let it, however, be incidentally remarked, and let it be carefully remembered, that if no women have ri&s;en &s;o high in the &s;cale of moral excellence as tho&s;e who&s;e natural warmth has been con&s;cienti|ou&s;ly governed by its true guide, and directed to its true end; &s;o none have furni&s;hed &s;uch deplorable in&s;tances of extreme depravity as tho&s;e who, through
<PB N="75" REF="037996_0290_100FABFB1E32E560">
the ignorance or the dereliction of principle, have been abandoned by the exce&s;s of this very temper to the violence of ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions and uncontrolled inclinations. Perhaps, if we were to inquire into the remote cau&s;e of &s;ome of the blacke&s;t crimes which &s;tain the annals of mankind, profligacy, mur|der, and e&s;pecially &s;uicide, we might trace them back to this original principle, an ungoverned Sen&s;i|bility.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the fine theories in pro&s;e and ver&s;e to which this topic has given birth, it will be found that very exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility contributes &s;o little to <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> and may yet be made to contribute &s;o much to <HI>u&s;efulne&s;s,</HI> that it may, perhaps, be con&s;i|dered as be&s;towed for an exerci&s;e to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or's own virtue, and as a keen in&s;trument with which &s;he may better work for the good of others.</P>
<P>Women of this ca&s;t of mind are le&s;s careful to avoid the charge of unbounded extremes, than to e&s;cape at all events the imputation of in&s;en&s;ibility. They are little alarmed at the danger of <HI>exceeding,</HI> though terrified at the &s;u&s;picion of <HI>coming &s;hort,</HI> of what they take to be the extreme point of feeling. They will even re&s;olve to prove the warmth of their &s;en&s;ibility, though at the expence of their judgment, and &s;ometimes al&s;o of their ju&s;tice. Even when they earne&s;tly de&s;ire to <HI>be</HI> and to <HI>do</HI> right, they are apt to employ the wrong in&s;trument to accompli&s;h the right

end. They employ the pa&s;&s;ions to do the work of the judgment; forgetting, or not knowing, that the pa&s;&s;ions were not given us to be u&s;ed in the &s;earch and di&s;covery of truth, which is the office of a cool|er and more di&s;criminating faculty; but that they were given to animate us to warmer zeal in the pur|&s;uit and practice of truth, when the judgment &s;hall have pointed out what <HI>is</HI> truth.</P>
<P>Through this natural warmth, which they have been ju&s;tly told is &s;o plea&s;ing, but which, perhaps, they have not been told will be continually expo&s;ing them to peril and to &s;uffering, their joys and &s;orrows are exce&s;&s;ive. Of this extreme irritability, as was before remarked, the ill-educated learn to boa&s;t as if it were a decided indication of &s;uperiority of &s;oul, in|&s;tead of labouring to re&s;train it as the exce&s;s of a temper which cea&s;es to be amiable, when it is no longer under the control of the governing faculty. It is misfortune enough to be born more liable to &s;uffer and to &s;in, from this conformation of mind; it is too much to nouri&s;h the evil by unre&s;trained in|dulgence; it is &s;till wor&s;e to be proud of &s;o mi&s;|leading a quality.</P>
<P>Flippancy, impetuo&s;ity, re&s;entment, and violence of &s;pirit, grow out of this di&s;po&s;ition, which will be rather promoted than corrected, by the &s;y&s;tem of education on which we have been animadverting; in which &s;y&s;tem, emotions are too early and too much
<PB N="77" REF="037996_0292_100FAC00CF1F42F8">
excited, and ta&s;tes and feelings are con&s;idered as too exclu&s;ively making up the whole of the female cha|racter: in which the judgment is little exerci&s;ed, the rea&s;oning powers are &s;eldom brought into action, and &s;elf-knowledge and &s;elf-denial &s;carcely included.</P>
<P>The propen&s;ity of mind which we are con&s;ider|ing, if unchecked, lays its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors open to unju&s;t prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and expo&s;es them to all the danger of unfounded attachments. In early youth, not only love at fir&s;t &s;ight, but al&s;o friend&s;hip, of the &s;ame &s;udden growth, &s;prings up from an ill-directed &s;en|&s;ibility; and in after-life, women under the powerful influence of this temper, con&s;cious that they have much to be borne with, are too readily inclined to &s;elect for their confidential connections, flexible and flattering companions, who will indulge and perhaps admire their faults, rather than firm and hone&s;t friends, who will reprove and would a&s;&s;i&s;t in curing them. We may adopt it as a general maxim, that an obliging, weak, yielding, complai&s;ant friend, full of &s;mall attentions, with little religion, little judg|ment, and much natural acquie&s;cence and civility, is a mo&s;t dangerous, though generally a too much de|&s;ired confidante: &s;he &s;oothes the indolence, and grati|fies the vanity of her friend, by reconciling her to her faults, while &s;he neither keeps the under&s;tanding nor the virtues of that friend in exerci&s;e; but with|holds from her every u&s;eful truth, which by opening
<PB N="78" REF="037996_0293_100FAC0365A3E128">
her eyes might give her pain. The&s;e ob&s;equious qualities are the "&s;oft green"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burke's "Sublime and Beautiful."</NOTE> on which the &s;oul loves to repo&s;e it&s;elf. But it is not a refre&s;hing or a whole&s;ome repo&s;e: we &s;hould not &s;elect, for the &s;ake of pre&s;ent ea&s;e a &s;oothing flatterer, who will lull us into a plea&s;ing oblivion of our failings, but a friend, who, valuing our &s;oul's health above our immediate comfort, will rou&s;e us from torpid indulgence to ani|mation, vigilance, and virtue.</P>
<P>An ill-directed &s;en&s;ibility al&s;o leads a woman to be injudicious and eccentric in her <HI>charities;</HI> &s;he will be in danger of proportioning her bounty to the im|mediate effect which the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed object produces on her &s;en&s;es: and &s;he will be more liberal to a &s;mall di&s;tre&s;s pre&s;enting it&s;elf to her own eyes, than to the more pre&s;&s;ing wants and better claims of tho&s;e mi&s;e|ries of which &s;he only hears the relation. There is a &s;ort of &s;tage effect which &s;ome people require for their charities; &s;he will be apt al&s;o to de&s;ire, that the object of her compa&s;&s;ion &s;hall have &s;omething in|tere&s;ting and amiable in it, &s;uch as &s;hall furni&s;h plea&s;|ing images and lively pictures to her imagination, and engaging &s;ubjects for de&s;cription; forgetting, that in her charities, as well as in every thing el&s;e, &s;he is to be a "follower of Him who plea&s;ed not him&s;elf;" forgetting, that the mo&s;t coar&s;e and di&s;gu&s;ting object
<PB N="79" REF="037996_0294_100FAC05433F40C8">
is as much the repre&s;entative of Him, who &s;aid, <Q>In|a&s;much as ye do it to one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e, ye do it unto me,</Q> as the mo&s;t intere&s;ting: nay the more uninviting and repul&s;ive ca&s;es may be better te&s;ts of the principle on which we relieve, than tho&s;e which abound in pathos and intere&s;t, as we can have le&s;s &s;u&s;picion of our motive in the latter ca&s;e than in the former. But, while we ought to neglect neither of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;es, yet the le&s;s our feelings are caught by plea&s;ing circum&s;tances, the le&s;s will be the danger of our indulging &s;elf-complacency, and the more likely &s;hall we be to do what we do for the &s;ake of Him who has taught us, that no deeds but what are performed on that principle, <Q>&s;hall be re|compen&s;ed at the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>But through the want of that governing principle which &s;hould direct her &s;en&s;ibility, a tender-hearted woman, who&s;e hand, if &s;he be actually &s;urrounded with &s;cenes and circum&s;tances to call it into action, is

Only remove her into another &s;cene, di&s;tant from the wants &s;he has been relieving; place her in the lap of indulgence, &s;o entrenched with ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, &s;o immer&s;ed in the &s;oftne&s;s of life, that di&s;tre&s;s no longer finds any acce&s;s to her pre|&s;ence,
<PB N="80" REF="037996_0295_100FAC07E9A35510">
but through the faint and dull medium of a di&s;|tant repre&s;entation; remove her from the &s;ight and &s;ound of that mi&s;ery which, when pre&s;ent, &s;o tender|ly affected her&mdash;&s;he now forgets that mi&s;ery exi&s;ts; as &s;he hears but little, and &s;ees nothing of want and &s;orrow, &s;he is ready to fancy that the world is grown happier than it was: in the meantime, with a quiet con&s;cience and a thoughtle&s;s vanity, &s;he has been la|vi&s;hing on &s;uperfluities that money which &s;he would cheerfully have given to a charitable ca&s;e, had &s;he not forgotten that any &s;uch were in exi&s;tence, be|cau&s;e <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> had blocked up the avenues through which mi&s;ery u&s;ed to find its way to her heart; and now, when again &s;uch a ca&s;e forces it&s;elf into her pre&s;ence, &s;he laments with real &s;incerity that the mo|ney is gone which &s;hould have relieved it.</P>
<P>In the meantime, perhaps, other women of le&s;s na|tural &s;ympathy, but who&s;e &s;ympathies are under bet|ter regulation, or who act from a principle which requires little &s;timulus, have, by an habitual cour&s;e of &s;elf-denial, by a con&s;tant determination to refu&s;e them&s;elves unnece&s;&s;ary indulgences, and by guarding again&s;t that di&s;&s;olving PLEASURE which melts down the firme&s;t virtue that allows it&s;elf to ba&s;k in its beams, have been quietly furni&s;hing a regular provi|&s;ion for mi&s;eries, which their knowledge of the &s;tate of the world teaches them are every where to be found, and which their obedience to the will of God
<PB N="81" REF="037996_0296_100FAC0B9F150800">
tells them it is their duty both to find out and to re|lieve; a general expectation of being liable to be call|ed upon for acts of charity, will lead the con&s;cienti|ou&s;ly charitable always to be prepared.</P>
<P>On &s;uch a mind as we have been de&s;cribing, <HI>No|velty</HI> al&s;o will operate with peculiar force, and in no|thing more than in the article of charity. Old e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in&s;titutions, who&s;e continued exi&s;tence mu&s;t depend on the continued bounty of that affluence to which they owed their origin, will be &s;ometimes ne|glected, as pre&s;enting no variety to the imagination, as having by their uniformity cea&s;ed to be intere&s;ting, there is now a total failure of tho&s;e &s;prings of mere &s;en&s;itive feeling which &s;et the charity a-going, and tho&s;e &s;udden emotions of tenderne&s;s and gu&s;ts of pi|ty, which once were felt, mu&s;t now be excited by newer forms of di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;As age comes on, that cha|rity which has been the effect of mere feeling, grows cold and rigid, on account al&s;o of its having been often di&s;appointed in its high expectations of the gra|titude and &s;ub&s;equent merit of tho&s;e it has relieved; and by withdrawing its bounty, becau&s;e &s;ome of its objects have been unde&s;erving, it gives clear proof that what it be&s;towed was for its own gratification; and now finding that &s;elf-complacency at an end, it be&s;tows no longer. Probably too the cau&s;e of &s;o much di&s;appointment may have been, that ill choice of the objects to which feeling, rather than a di&s;cri|minating
<PB N="82" REF="037996_0297_100FAC0D2751A898">
judgment has led. The &s;ummer &s;howers of mere &s;en&s;ibility &s;oon dry up, while the living &s;pring of Chri&s;tian charity flows alike in all &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>The impatience, levity, and ficklene&s;s, of which women have been &s;omewhat too generally accu&s;ed, are perhaps in no &s;mall degree aggravated by the little|ne&s;s and frivolou&s;ne&s;s of female pur&s;uits. The &s;ort of education they commonly receive, teaches girls to &s;et a great price on &s;mall things. Be&s;ides this, they do not always learn to keep a very correct &s;cale of de|grees for rating the value of the objects of their ad|miration and attachment; but by a kind of uncon&s;ci|ous idolatry, they rather make a merit of loving <HI>&s;u|premely</HI> things and per&s;ons which ought to be loved with moderation and in a &s;ubordinate degree the one to the other. Unluckily, they con&s;ider moderation as &s;o nece&s;&s;arily indicating a cold heart and narrow &s;oul, and they look upon a &s;tate of indifference with &s;o much horror, that either to love or hate with en|ergy is &s;uppo&s;ed by them to proceed from a higher &s;tate of mind than is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by more &s;teady and equable characters. Whereas it is in fact the crite|rion of a warm but well-directed &s;en&s;ibility, that while it is capable of loving with energy, it mu&s;t be enabled, by the judgment which governs it, to &s;uit and adju&s;t its degree of intere&s;t to the nature and excellence of the object about which it is intere&s;ted; for unrea&s;onable prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, di&s;proportionate at|tachment,
<PB N="83" REF="037996_0298_100FAC0FC767DBD8">
and capricious or precarious fondne&s;s, is not &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Exce&s;&s;ive but unintentional <HI>flattery</HI> is another fault into which a &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility is in danger of leading its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. A tender heart and a warm imaginati|on con&s;pire to throw a &s;ort of radiance round the object of their love, till people are dazzled by a brightne&s;s of their own creating. The worldly and fa&s;hionable borrow the warm language of &s;en&s;ibility without having the really warm feeling; and young ladies get &s;uch a habit of &s;aying, and e&s;pecially of writing, &s;uch over obliging and flattering things to each other, that this mutual politene&s;s, aided by the &s;elf-love &s;o natural to us all, and by an unwillingne&s;s to &s;earch into our own hearts, keeps up the illu&s;ion, and we get a habit of taking our character from the good we <HI>hear</HI> of our&s;elves, which others a&s;&s;ume, but do not very well know, rather than from the evil we <HI>feel</HI> in our&s;elves, and which we therefore ought to be thoroughly acquainted with.</P>
<P>Ungoverned &s;en&s;ibility is apt to give a wrong direc|tion to its anxieties; and its affection often falls &s;hort of the true end of friend&s;hip. If the object of its re|gard happen to be &s;ick, what inquiries! what pre|&s;criptions! what an accumulation is made of ca&s;es in which the remedy its fondne&s;s &s;ugge&s;ts has been &s;ucce&s;sful! What an unaffected tenderne&s;s for the peri&s;hing body! Yet is this &s;en&s;ibility equally alive
<PB N="84" REF="037996_0299_100FAC13CD437E18">
to the immortal intere&s;ts of the &s;ufferer? Is it not &s;ilent and at ea&s;e when it contemplates the deare&s;t friend per&s;i&s;ting in opinions e&s;&s;entially dangerous; in practices unque&s;tionably wrong? Does it not view all this, not only without a generous ardour to point out the peril, and re&s;cue the friend; but if that friend be &s;uppo&s;ed to be dying, does it not even make it the <HI>criterion</HI> of kindne&s;s to let her die undeceived? What a want of true &s;en&s;ibility, to feel for the pain, but not for the danger of tho&s;e we love! Now &s;ee what &s;ort of &s;en&s;ibility the Bible teaches! <Q>Thou &s;halt not hate thy brother in thine heart, but thou &s;halt in any wi&s;e rebuke him, and &s;halt not &s;uffer &s;in upon him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leviticus, xix. 17.</NOTE>.</Q> But let that tenderne&s;s which &s;hrinks from the idea of expo&s;ing what it loves to a momentary pang, figure to it&s;elf the bare po&s;&s;ibility, that the object of its own fond affection may not be the object of its own fond affection may not be the object of the Divine favour! Let it &s;hrink from the bare conjecture, that <Q>the familiar friend with whom it has taken &s;weet coun&s;el,</Q> is going down to the gates of death, unrepenting, unprepared, and yet unwarned.</P>
<P>But mere human &s;en&s;ibility goes a &s;horter way to work. Not being able to give its friend the pain of hearing her faults or of knowing her danger, it works it&s;elf up into the quieting delu&s;ion that no
<PB N="85" REF="037996_0300_100FAC16647FE710">
danger exi&s;ts, at lea&s;t not for the objects of its own affection; it gratifies it&s;elf by inventing a &s;alvation &s;o comprehen&s;ive as &s;hall take in all it&s;elf loves with all their faults; it creates to its own fond heart an ideal and exaggerated divine mercy, which &s;hall pardon and receive all in whom this blind &s;en&s;ibility has an intere&s;t, whether they be good or whether they be evil.</P>
<P>In regard to its application to religious purpo&s;es, it is a te&s;t that &s;en&s;ibility has received its true directi|on when it is &s;upremely turned to the love of God: for to po&s;&s;e&s;s an overflowing fondne&s;s for our fellow-creatures and fellow-&s;inners, and to be cold and in|&s;en&s;ible to the E&s;&s;ence of goodne&s;s and perfection, is an incon&s;i&s;tency to which the feeling heart is awfully liable. God has him&s;elf the fir&s;t claim to the &s;en&s;i|bility he be&s;towed. "He <HI>fir&s;t</HI> loved us:" this is a <HI>natural</HI> cau&s;e of love, <Q>He loved us while we were &s;inners:</Q> this is a <HI>&s;upernatural</HI> cau&s;e. He conti|nues to love us though we neglect his favours, and &s;light his mercies: this would wear out any earthly kindne&s;s. He forgives us, not petty neglects, not occa&s;ional &s;lights, but grievous &s;ins, repeated offen|ces, broken vows, and unrequited love. What hu|man friend&s;hip performs offices &s;o calculated to touch the &s;oul of &s;en&s;ibility?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e young women in whom feeling is indulged to the exclu&s;ion of rea&s;on and examination, are pecu|liarly
<PB N="86" REF="037996_0301_100FAC17EC060CD0">
liable to be the dupes of prejudice, ra&s;h deci|&s;ions, and fal&s;e judgment. The under&s;tanding hav|ing but little power over the will, their affections are not well poized, and their minds are kept in a &s;tate ready to be acted upon by the fluctuations of al|ternate impul&s;es; by &s;udden and varying impre&s;&s;ions; by ca&s;ual and contradictory circum&s;tances; and by emotions excited by every accident. In&s;tead of being guided by the broad views of general truth, and hav|ing one fixed principle, they are driven on by the im|petuo&s;ity of the moment. And this impetuo&s;ity blinds the judgment as much as it mi&s;leads the conduct; &s;o that for want of a habit of cool inve&s;tigation and in|quiry, they meet every event without any previou&s;ly formed opinion or rule of action. And as they do not accu&s;tom them&s;elves to appreciate the real value of things, their attention is as likely to be led away by the under parts of a &s;ubject, as to &s;eize on the leading feature. The &s;ame eagerne&s;s of mind which hinders the operation of the di&s;criminating faculty, leads al&s;o to the error of determining on the recti|tude of an action by its &s;ucce&s;s, and to that of mak|ing the event of an undertaking decide on its ju&s;tice or propriety: it al&s;o leads to that &s;uperficial and er|roneous way of judging which fa&s;tens on exceptions, if they make in one's own favour, as grounds of rea|&s;oning, while they lead us to overlook received and

general rules which tend to e&s;tabli&s;h a doctrine con|trary to our wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Open-hearted, indi&s;creet girls, often pick up a few &s;trong notions, which are as fal&s;e in them&s;elves as they are popular among the cla&s;s in que&s;tion: &s;uch as, "that warm friends mu&s;t make warm enemies;"&mdash;that <Q>the generous love and hate with all their hearts;</Q>&mdash;that <Q>a reformed rake makes the be&s;t hu&s;band;</Q>&mdash;that <Q>there is no medium in marriage, but that it is a &s;tate of exqui&s;ite happine&s;s or exqui|&s;ite mi&s;ery;</Q> with many other doctrines of equal currency and equal &s;oundne&s;s! The&s;e they con&s;ider as axioms, and adopt as rules of life. From the two fir&s;t of the&s;e oracular &s;ayings, girls are in no &s;mall danger of becoming unju&s;t through the very warmth of their hearts: for they will get a habit of making their e&s;timate of the good or ill qualities of others, mere|ly in proportion to the greater or le&s;s degree of kind|ne&s;s which they them&s;elves have received from them. Their e&s;timation of general character is thus formed on in&s;ulated and partial grounds; on the accidental circum&s;tance of per&s;onal predilection or per&s;onal pique. Kindne&s;s to them&s;elves or their friends in|volves all po&s;&s;ible excellence; neglect, all imagina|ble defects. Friend&s;hip and gratitude can and &s;hould go a great way; but as they cannot convert vice into into virtue, &s;o they ought never to convert truth in|to fal&s;ehood. And it may be the more nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="88" REF="037996_0303_100FAC1D2EEBDF10">
be upon our guard in this in&s;tance, becau&s;e the ve|ry idea of gratitude may mi&s;lead us, by converting inju&s;tice, into the &s;emblance of a virtue. Warm ex|pre&s;&s;ions &s;hould therefore be limited to the convey|ing a &s;en&s;e of our own individual obligations which are real, rather than employed to give an impre&s;&s;ion of general excellence in the per&s;on who has obliged us, which may be imaginary. A good man is &s;till good, though it may not have fallen in his way to oblige or &s;erve <HI>us,</HI> nay, though he may have neglect|ed or even unintentionally hurt us: and &s;in is &s;till &s;in, though committed by the per&s;on in the world to whom we are the mo&s;t obliged, and whom we mo&s;t love.</P>
<P>We come next to that fatal and mo&s;t indelicate, nay gro&s;s maxim, that <Q>a reformed rake makes the be&s;t hu&s;band;</Q> an aphori&s;m to which the principles and the happine&s;s of &s;o many young women have been &s;acrificed. It goes upon the prepo&s;terous &s;up|po&s;ition, not only that effects do not follow cau&s;es, but that they oppo&s;e them; on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that habitual vice creates rectitude of character, and that &s;in produces happine&s;s: thus flatly contradicting what the moral government of God uniformly exhibits in the cour&s;e of human events, and what Revelation &s;o evidently and univer&s;ally teaches.</P>
<P>For it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that the reformation is generally, if not always &s;uppo&s;ed to be brought about

Let but a profligate young man have a point to carry by winning the affections of a vain and thoughtle&s;s girl; he will begin his attack upon her heart by undermin|ing her religious principles, and artfully removing every impediment which might have ob&s;tructed her receiving the addre&s;&s;es of a man without character. And while he will lead her not to hear without ridi|cule the mention of that change of heart which Scrip|ture teaches and experience proves the power of Di|vine grace can work on a vicious character; while he will teach her to &s;neer at a change which he would treat with contempt, becau&s;e he denies the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;o &s;trange and miraculous a conver&s;ion; yet he will not &s;cruple to &s;wear, that the power of her beauty has worked a revolution in his own loo&s;e practices which is equally complete and in&s;tanta|neous.</P>

<P>As to the la&s;t of the&s;e practical aphori&s;ms, that <Q>there is no medium in marriage, but that it is a &s;tate of exqui&s;ite happine&s;s or exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery;</Q> this, though not equally &s;inful, is equally delu&s;ive: for marriage is only one modification of human life, and human life is not commonly in it&s;elf a &s;tate of exqui&s;ite extremes; but is for the mo&s;t part that mixed and moderate &s;tate, &s;o naturally dreaded by tho&s;e who &s;et out with fancying this world a &s;tate of rapture, and &s;o naturally expected by tho&s;e who know it to be a &s;tate of probation and di&s;cipline.

The truth is, the&s;e young ladies are very apt to pick up their opinions, le&s;s from the divines than the poets; and the poets, though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed they are &s;ome of the be&s;t embelli&s;hers of life, are not <HI>quite</HI> the &s;afe&s;t conductors through it: for in tra|velling through a wilderne&s;s, though we avail our|&s;elves of the harmony of &s;inging-birds to render the grove delightful, yet we never think of following them as guides to conduct us through its labyrinths.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>On di&s;&s;ipation, and the modern habits of fa&s;hionable life.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>PERHAPS the intere&s;ts of true friend&s;hip, elegant conver&s;ation, mental improvement, &s;ocial plea&s;ure, maternal duty, and conjugal comfort, never received &s;uch a blow as when Fa&s;hion i&s;&s;ued out that arbitra|ry and univer&s;al decree, that <HI>every body mu&s;t be ac|quainted with every body;</HI> together with that con&s;equent, authoritative, but rather inconvenient clau&s;e, that <HI>every body mu&s;t al&s;o go every where every night.</HI> The devout obedience paid to this law is incompati|ble with the very being of friend&s;hip; for as the circle of acquaintance expands, and it will be con|tinually expanding, the affections will be beaten out into &s;uch thin lamina as to leave little &s;olidity remain|ing. The heart which is continually exhau&s;ting it|&s;elf in profe&s;&s;ions grows cold and hard. The feel|ings of kindne&s;s dimini&s;h in proportion as the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of it becomes more diffu&s;e and indi&s;crimi|nate. The very traces of <Q>&s;implicity and godly &s;incerity</Q> in a delicate female, wear away imper|ceptibly by con&s;tant colli&s;ion with the world at large. And perhaps no woman takes &s;o little intere&s;t in the
<PB N="99" REF="037996_0314_100FAC3AADDB6140">
happine&s;s of her real friends, as &s;he who&s;e affec|tions are ince&s;&s;antly evaporating in univer&s;al civilities; as &s;he who is &s;aying fond and flattering things at random to a circle of five hundred people every night.</P>
<P>The decline and fall of animated and in&s;tructive conver&s;ation has been in a good mea&s;ure effected by this barbarous project of a&s;&s;embling <HI>en ma&s;&s;e.</HI> An excellent prelate,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late Bi&s;hop of Horne.</NOTE> with who&s;e friend&s;hip the author was long honoured, and who him&s;elf excelled in the art of conver&s;ation, u&s;ed to remark, that a few years had brought about a great revolution in the manners of &s;ociety; that it u&s;ed to be the cu&s;|tom, previou&s;ly to going into company, to think that &s;omething was to be communicated or received, taught or learnt; that the powers of the under|&s;tanding were expected to be brought into exerci&s;e, and that it was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to quicken the mind, by reading and thinking, for the &s;hare the individual might be expected to take in the general di&s;cour&s;e; but that knowledge, and ta&s;te, and wit, and erudition, &s;eemed now to be &s;carcely con&s;idered as nece&s;&s;ary materials to be brought into the plea&s;ur|able commerce of the world; becau&s;e now there was little chance of turning them to much account; and therefore he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, and he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them not, were nearly on a footing.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="037996_0315_100FAC3D537CA9A8">
It is obvious al&s;o that multitudinous a&s;&s;emblies are &s;o little favourable to that <HI>cheerfulne&s;s</HI> which it &s;hould &s;eem to be their very end to promote, that if there were any chemical proce&s;s by which the quantum of &s;pirits animal or intellectual could be a&s;certained, the diminution would be found to have been incon|ceivably great, &s;ince the transformation of man and woman from a &s;ocial to a gregarious animal.</P>
<P>But if it be true that friend&s;hip, &s;ociety, and cheerfulne&s;s, have &s;u&s;tained &s;o much injury by this change of manners, how much more pointedly does the remark apply to family happine&s;s!</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the known fluctuation of manners and the mutability of language, could it be fore&s;een, when the Apo&s;tle Paul exhorted <Q>married women to be keepers <HI>at home,</HI></Q> that the time would arrive when that very phra&s;e would be &s;elected to de&s;ignate one of the mo&s;t decided acts of di&s;&s;ipation? Could it be fore&s;een that when a fine lady &s;hould &s;end out a notification that on &s;uch a night &s;he &s;hall be AT HOME, the&s;e two &s;ignificant words (be&s;ides intimat|ing the rarity of the thing) would pre&s;ent to the mind an image the mo&s;t <HI>undome&s;tic</HI> which language can convey? My country readers, who may require to have it explained that the&s;e two magnetic words now po&s;&s;e&s;s the powerful influence of drawing together every thing <HI>fine</HI> within the &s;phere of their attraction, may need al&s;o to be apprized, that the gue&s;ts after|wards

are not a&s;ked what was <HI>&s;aid</HI> by the company, but whether the <HI>crowd</HI> was prodigious, the rule for deciding on the merit of a fa&s;hionable &s;ociety not being by the ta&s;te or the &s;pirit, but by the <HI>&s;core</HI> and the <HI>hundred.</HI> The que&s;tion of plea&s;ure, like a Parlia|mentary que&s;tion, is now carried by numbers.

But if they are really in earne&s;t to give them a Chri&s;tian education, they mu&s;t them&s;elves renounce a di&s;&s;ipat|ed life. Or if they re&s;olve to pur&s;ue the chace of plea&s;ure, they mu&s;t renounce this prime duty. Con|traries cannot unite. The moral nurture of a tall daughter can no more be admini&s;tered by a mother who&s;e time is ab&s;orbed by crowds abroad, than the phy&s;ical nurture of her infant offspring can be &s;up|plied by her in a perpetual ab&s;ence from home.

And is not that a prepo&s;terous affection which leads a mother to devote a few months to the inferior du|ty of furni&s;hing aliment to the mere animal life, and then to de&s;ert her po&s;t when the more important mo|ral and intellectual cravings require &s;u&s;tenance? This great object is not to be effected with the &s;hreds and parings rounded off from the circle of a di&s;&s;ipat|ed life; but in order to its adequate execution, the mother &s;hould carry it on with the &s;ame &s;pirit and per&s;everance at home, which the father thinks it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be exerting abroad in his public duty or profe&s;&s;ional engagements.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual vindication (and in theory it has a plau|&s;ible &s;ound) which has been offered for the large portion of time &s;pent by women in acquiring orna|mental talents is, that they are calculated to make the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or love home, and that they innocently fill up the hours of lei&s;ure. The plea has indeed &s;o promi&s;ing an appearance, that it is worth inquiring whether it be in fact true.

<P>From the mention of watering places, may the author be allowed to &s;ugge&s;t a few remarks on the evils which have ari&s;en from the general con&s;piracy of the gay to u&s;urp the regions of the &s;ick; and from their converting the health-re&s;toring fountains, meant as a refuge for di&s;ea&s;e, into the re&s;orts of va|nity for tho&s;e who have no di&s;ea&s;e but idlene&s;s?</P>

That affecting precept followed by &s;o gracious a promi&s;e, <Q>Never turn away thy face from any poor man, and then the face of the Lord &s;hall never be turned away from thee,</Q> cannot lite|rally mean that we &s;hould <HI>give</HI> to all, as then we &s;hould &s;oon have nothing left to give: but it &s;eems to intimate the habitual attention, the duty of inquiring out all ca&s;es of di&s;tre&s;s, in order to judge which are fit to be relieved; now for this inquiry, for this at|tention, the di&s;&s;ipated have little ta&s;te and le&s;s lei&s;ure.</P>

And what is even almo&s;t more than the good done, is the habit of mind kept up in tho&s;e who do it. Would not this habit, exerci&s;ed on the Chri&s;tian principle, that "even a cup of cold water," given upon <HI>right motives,</HI> &s;hall not lo&s;e its reward; while the giving "all their goods to feed the poor," without the true <HI>principle</HI> of charity, &s;hall profit them nothing; would not this habit, I &s;ay, be al|mo&s;t the be&s;t part of the education of daughters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would be a plea&s;ant &s;ummer amu&s;ement for our young la|dies of fortune, if they were to pre&s;ide at &s;uch &s;pinning fea&s;ts as are in&s;tituted at Nun<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ham for the promotion of virtue and indu&s;try in their own &s;ex.

But tran&s;plant this wealthy and bountiful family periodically to the frivolous and unintere&s;ting bu&s;tle of the watering place; there it is not denied that fre|quent public and fa&s;hionable acts of charity may make a part, (and it is well they do) of the bu&s;ine&s;s and amu&s;ement of the day; with this latter, indeed, they are &s;ometimes good-naturedly mixed up. But how &s;hall we compare the regular &s;y&s;tematical good the&s;e per&s;ons would be doing at their own home, with the light, and amu&s;ing, and bu&s;tling bounties of the public place? The illegal raffle at the toy|&s;hop, may relieve, it is true, &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s, but this di&s;tre&s;s though it may be real, and though if real, it ought to be relieved, is far le&s;s ea&s;ily a&s;certained than the wants of the poor round a per&s;on's own door, or the debts of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed tenant. How &s;hall we compare the broad &s;tream of bounty which &s;hould be flowing through and refre&s;hing whole di&s;|tricts, with the penurious current of the &s;ub&s;cription breakfa&s;t for the needy mu&s;ician, in which the price
<PB N="107" REF="037996_0322_100FAC506FA7D058">
of the gift is taken out in the diver&s;ion, and in which plea&s;ure dignifies it&s;elf with the name of boun|ty? How &s;hall we compare the attention, and time, and zeal which would otherwi&s;e, perhaps, be de|voted to the village &s;chool, &s;pent in hawking about benefit tickets for a broken player, while the kind|ne&s;s of the benefactre&s;s, perhaps, is rewarded by &s;cenes in which her charity is not always repaid by the purity of the exhibition?</P>
<P>Far be it from the author to wi&s;h to check the full tide of charity wherever it is di&s;po&s;ed to flow! Would &s;he could multiply the already abundant &s;treams, and behold every &s;ource purified! But in the public re|&s;orts there are many who are able and willing to give. In the &s;eque&s;tered, though populous village, there is, perhaps only one affluent family: the di&s;|tre&s;s which they do not <HI>behold,</HI> will probably not be attended to: the di&s;tre&s;s which <HI>they</HI> do not relieve will probably not be relieved at all: the wrongs which <HI>they</HI> do not redre&s;s will go unredre&s;&s;ed: the oppre&s;&s;ed whom <HI>they</HI> do not re&s;cue will &s;ink under the tyranny of the oppre&s;&s;or. Through their own rural domains too, charity runs in a clearer current, and is under le&s;s &s;u&s;picion of being polluted by that muddy tincture which it is &s;ometimes apt to con|tract in pa&s;&s;ing through the impure &s;oil of the world.</P>

But to return from this too long digre&s;&s;ion: the old &s;tanding objection formerly brought forward by the prejudices of the other &s;ex, and too eagerly laid hold on as a &s;helter for indolence and ignorance by ours, was, that intellectual accompli&s;hments too much ab&s;orbed the thoughts and affections, took women off from the nece&s;&s;ary attention to dome&s;tic duties, and &s;uperinduced a contempt or neglect of whatever was u&s;eful.&mdash;But it is peculiarly the cha|racter of the pre&s;ent day to detect ab&s;urd opinions, and expo&s;e plau&s;ible theories by the &s;imple and deci&s;ive an&s;wer of experiment; and it is pre&s;umed that this popular error, as well as others, is daily receiving the refutation of actual experience. For it cannot &s;urely be maintained on ground that is any longer tenable, that acquirements truly rational are calculated to draw off the mind from real duties. Whatever removes prejudices, whatever &s;timulates indu&s;try, whatever rectifies the judgment, whatever corrects &s;elf-conceit, whatever purifies the ta&s;te, and rai&s;es the under&s;tanding, will be likely to contribute to moral excellence: to woman moral excellence is the grand object of education; and of moral excel|lence, dome&s;tic life is to woman the proper &s;phere.</P>

<P>The time nightly expended in late female vigils is expended by the light of far other lamps than tho&s;e which are fed by the &s;tudent's oil; and if families <HI>are</HI> to be found who are neglected through too much &s;tudy in the mi&s;tre&s;s, it will probably be proved to be Hoyle, and not Homer, who has robbed her children of her time and affections. For one family which has been neglected by the mother's pa&s;&s;ion for books, an hundred have been de&s;erted through her pa&s;&s;ion for play. The hu&s;band of a fa&s;hionable wo|man will not often find that the library is the apart|ment the expences of which involve him in debt or di&s;grace.

<P>May I digre&s;s a little while I remark, that I am far from a&s;&s;erting that literature has never filled wo|men with vanity and &s;elf-conceit; the contrary is too obvious: but I will a&s;&s;ert, that in general tho&s;e whom books are &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;poiled, would have been &s;poiled in another way without them. She who is a

vain pedant becau&s;e &s;he has read much, has probably that defect in her mind which would have made her a vain fool if &s;he had read nothing. It is not her having more knowledge, but le&s;s &s;en&s;e, which makes her in&s;ufferable; and ignorance would have added little to her value, for it is not what &s;he has, but what &s;he wants, which makes her unplea&s;ant. The&s;e in&s;tances too furni&s;h only a fre&s;h argument for the general cultivation of the female mind. The wider diffu&s;ion of &s;ound knowledge, would remove that temptation to be vain which may be excited by its rarity.</P>
<P>But while we would a&s;&s;ert that a woman of a cul|tivated intellect is not driven by the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity as others into the giddy whirl of public re&s;ort; who but regrets that real cultivation does not <HI>inevitably</HI> pre&s;erve her from it? No wonder that inanity of character, that vacuity of mind, that torpid igno|rance, &s;hould plunge into di&s;&s;ipation as their natural refuge; &s;hould &s;eek to bury their in&s;ignificance in the crowd of pre&s;&s;ing multitudes, and hope to e&s;cape analy&s;is and detection in the undi&s;tingui&s;hed ma&s;&s;es of mixed a&s;&s;emblies! <HI>There</HI> attrition rubs all bodies &s;mooth, and makes all &s;urfaces alike; thither &s;uper|ficial and external accompli&s;hments naturally fly as to their proper &s;cene of action; as to a field where competition in &s;uch trifles is in perpetual exerci&s;e; where the laurels of admiration are to be won, where

<P>It would indeed be matter of little comparative re|gret, if this corrupt air were breathed only by tho&s;e who&s;e natural element it &s;eems to be; but who can forbear lamenting that the power of fa&s;hion attracts into this impure and unwhole&s;ome atmo&s;phere, minds al&s;o of a better make, of higher aims and ends, of more ethereal temper? that it attracts even tho&s;e who, renouncing enjoyments for which they have a genuine ta&s;te, and which would make them really happy, neglect &s;ociety they love and pur&s;uits they admire, in order that they may <HI>&s;eem</HI> happy and <HI>be</HI> fa&s;hionable in the chace of plea&s;ures they de&s;pi&s;e, and in company they di&s;approve! But no correctne&s;s of ta&s;te, no depth of knowledge, will infallibly pre|&s;erve a woman from this contagion, unle&s;s her heart be impre&s;&s;ed with a deep Chri&s;tian conviction that &s;he is re&s;pon&s;ible for the application of knowledge as well as for the dedication of time.</P>

to a growing, regular, &s;y&s;tematic &s;eries of amu&s;e|ments; to an ince&s;&s;ant, boundle&s;s, and not very di&s;|reputable DISSIPATION. Other corruptions, though more formidable in appearance, are yet le&s;s fatal in &s;ome re&s;pects, becau&s;e they leave us intervals to re|flect on their turpitude, and &s;pirit to lament their ex|ce&s;&s;es; but di&s;&s;ipation is the more hopele&s;s, as by engro&s;&s;ing almo&s;t the entire life, and enervating the whole moral and intellectual &s;y&s;tem, it leaves neither time for reflection, nor &s;pace for &s;elf-examination, nor temper for the cheri&s;hing of right affections, nor lei&s;ure for the operation of &s;ound principles, nor in|terval for regret, nor vigour to re&s;i&s;t temptation, nor energy to &s;truggle for amendment.</P>
<P>The great ma&s;ter of the &s;cience of plea&s;ure among the ancients, who reduced it into a &s;y&s;tem, which he called <HI>the chief good of man,</HI> directed that there &s;hould be interval enough between the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of delights to &s;harpen inclination; and accordingly in&s;ti|tuted periodical days of ab&s;tinence; well knowing that gratification was be&s;t promoted by previous &s;elf-denial. But &s;o little do our votaries of fa&s;hion under|&s;tand the true nature of plea&s;ure, that one amu&s;e|ment is allowed to overtake another without any in|terval, either for recollection of the pa&s;t or prepara|tion for the future.

The natural and healthful fatigues of bu&s;ine&s;s may be recruited by &s;imple and cheap gratifications; but a &s;pirit worn down with the toils of amu&s;ement, requires plea&s;ures of poignancy; varied, multiplied, &s;timulating!</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved by medical writers, that that &s;ober exce&s;s in which many indulge, by eating and drinking a little too much at every day's dinner and every night's &s;upper, more effectually undermines the health, than tho&s;e more rare exce&s;&s;es by which others now and then break in upon a life of general &s;obriety. This illu&s;tration is not introduced with a de&s;ign to recommend occa&s;ional deviations into gro&s;s vice, by way of a pious receipt for mending the morals; but merely to &s;ugge&s;t that there is a proba|bility that tho&s;e who are &s;ometimes driven by unre|&s;i&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion into irregularities which &s;hock their cooler rea&s;on, are more liable to be rou&s;ed to a &s;en&s;e of their danger, than per&s;ons who&s;e perceptions of evil are blunted through a round of &s;y&s;tematical,

uncea&s;ing, and yet not &s;candalous di&s;&s;ipation.

<P>But there &s;eems to be an error in the fir&s;t concoc|tion, out of which the &s;ub&s;equent errors &s;ucce&s;&s;ively grow. Fir&s;t then, as has been ob&s;erved before, the &s;howy education of women tends chiefly to qualify them for the glare of public a&s;&s;emblies: &s;econdly, they &s;eem in many in&s;tances to be &s;o educated, with a view to the greater probability of their being &s;plen|didly married: thirdly, it is alleged in vindication of tho&s;e di&s;&s;ipated practices, that daughters can only be &s;een and admirers procured at balls, operas, and a&s;|&s;emblies: and that therefore, by a natural con&s;e|quence, balls, operas, and a&s;&s;emblies mu&s;t be follow|ed up without intermi&s;&s;ion till the object be effected. For the accompli&s;hment of this object it is that all this complicated machinery had been previou&s;ly &s;et a-going, and kept in motion with an activity not at

<P>It is al&s;o, as we have already remarked, an error to fancy that the love of plea&s;ure exhau&s;ts it&s;elf by indulgence, and that the very young are chiefly ad|dicted to it. The contrary appears to be true. The de&s;ire often grows with the pur&s;uit in the &s;ame de|gree as motion is quickened by the continuance of the gravitating force.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, it cannot be thought unfair to trace back the exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s for amu&s;ement to that mode of education we have el&s;ewhere reprobated.

<P>There is, among the more elevated cla&s;&s;es of &s;oci|ety, a certain &s;et of per&s;ons who are plea&s;ed exclu|&s;ively to call them&s;elves, and whom others by a &s;ort of compelled courte&s;y are plea&s;ed to call, <HI>the fine world.</HI> This &s;mall detachment con&s;ider their &s;itua|tion with re&s;pect to the re&s;t of mankind, ju&s;t as the ancient Grecians did theirs; that is, as the Grecians thought there were but two &s;orts of beings, and that all who were not Grecians were barbarians; &s;o this <HI>certain &s;et</HI> conceives of &s;ociety as re&s;olving it&s;elf into two di&s;tinct cla&s;&s;es, the <HI>fine world</HI> and the <HI>people;</HI> to which la&s;t cla&s;s they turn over all who do not belong to their little <HI>coterie,</HI> however high their rank, or fortune, or merit. Celebrity, in their e&s;timation, is not be&s;towed by birth or talents, but by being con|nected with <HI>them.</HI> They have laws, immunities, privileges, and almo&s;t a language of their own; they form a kind of di&s;tinct <HI>ca&s;t,</HI> and with a &s;ort of <HI>e&s;prit du corps</HI> detach them&s;elves from others, even in ge|neral &s;ociety, by an affectation of di&s;tance and cold|ne&s;s; and only whi&s;per and &s;mile in their own little groups of the initiated; their confines are jealou&s;ly guarded, and their privileges are incommunicable.</P>
<P>In this &s;ociety a young man lo&s;es his natural cha|racter, which, whatever it might have been origi|nally,
<PB N="120" REF="037996_0335_100FAC74E41AEF68">
is melted down and ca&s;t into the one prevail|ing mould of Fa&s;hion; all the &s;trong, native, di&s;|criminating qualities of his mind being made to take one &s;hape, one &s;tamp, one &s;uper&s;cription! However varied and di&s;tinct might have been the materials which nature threw into the crucible, pla&s;tic Fa&s;hion takes care that they &s;hall all be the &s;ame, or at lea&s;t appear the &s;ame, when they come out of the mould. A young man in &s;uch an artificial &s;tate of &s;ociety, ac|cu&s;tomed to the voluptuous ea&s;e, refined luxuries, &s;oft accommodations, ob&s;equious attendance, and all the unre&s;trained indulgencies of a fa&s;hionable club, is not to be expected after marriage to take very cordially to a home, unle&s;s very extraordinary exer|tions are made to amu&s;e, to attach, and to intere&s;t him: and he is not likely to lend a very helping hand to the happine&s;s of the union, who&s;e mo&s;t laborious exertions have hitherto been little more than a &s;elfi&s;h &s;tratagem to reconcile health with plea&s;ure. Exce&s;s of gratification has only &s;erved to make him irritable and exacting; it will of cour&s;e be no part of his project to make &s;acrifices, he will expect to receive them: and what would appear incredible to the <HI>Paladins</HI> of gallant times, and the <HI>Chevaliers Preux</HI> of more heroic days, even in the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of e&s;tabli&s;hing him&s;elf for life, he &s;ometimes is more di&s;po&s;ed to expect attentions than to make advances.</P>

Thus the indolent &s;on of fa&s;hion, with a thou&s;and fine, but dormant qualities, which a bad tone of manners forbids him to bring into exerci&s;e; with real energies which that tone does not allow him to di&s;cover, and an unreal apathy which it commands him to feign; with the heart of an hero, perhaps, if called into the field, affects at home the manners of a Sybarite; and he who, with a Roman, or what is more, with a Briti&s;h valour, would leap into the gulph at the call of public duty,

<P>The clubs above alluded to, as has been &s;aid, ge|nerate and cheri&s;h luxurious habits, from their perfect ea&s;e, undre&s;s, liberty, and inattentions to the di&s;tinc|tions of rank: they promote a love of play, and in &s;hort, every temper and &s;pirit which tends to un|dome&s;ticate; and what adds to the mi&s;chief is, all this is attained at a cheap rate compared with what may be procured at home in the &s;ame &s;tyle.</P>
<P>The&s;e indulgencies, and this habit of mind, im|ply &s;o much gratification of the pa&s;&s;ions, that a wo|man can never hope &s;ucce&s;sfully to counteract the evil by &s;upplying at home gratifications in a &s;uperior degree, which are of the &s;ame kind. If &s;he &s;hould attempt this, in a little time &s;he will find that tho&s;e

pa&s;&s;ions, to which &s;he has tru&s;ted for making plea|&s;ant the married life of her hu&s;band, will crave the &s;till higher plea&s;ures of the club; and while the&s;e are pur&s;ued, &s;he will be con&s;igned over to &s;olitary even|ings at home, or driven back to the old di&s;&s;ipations.</P>
<P>To conquer the pa&s;&s;ion for club gratifications, a woman mu&s;t not &s;trive to feed it with &s;ufficient ali|ment in the &s;ame kind in her &s;ociety, either at home or abroad; &s;he mu&s;t &s;upplant and overcome it by a pa&s;&s;ion of a different nature, which Providence has kindly planted within us, I mean by in&s;piring him with the love of fire-&s;ide enjoyments. But to qualify her&s;elf for admini&s;tering the&s;e, &s;he mu&s;t cultivate her under&s;tanding and her heart, and her temper, ac|quiring at the &s;ame time that modicum of accompli&s;h|ments &s;uited to his ta&s;te, which may qualify her for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, both for him and for her&s;elf, greater varieties of &s;afe recreation.</P>
<P>One great cau&s;e of the want of attachment in the&s;e modi&s;h couples is, that by living in the world at large, they are not driven to depend on each other as the chief &s;ource of comfort. Now it is pretty clear, in &s;pite of modern theories, that the very frame and being of &s;ocieties, whether great or &s;mall, public or private, is jointed and glued together by dependence. Tho&s;e attachments which ari&s;e from, and are com|pacted by, a &s;en&s;e of mutual wants, mutual affec|tion, mutual benefit, and mutual obligation, are the

<P>Unfortunately, when two young per&s;ons of the above de&s;cription marry, the union is &s;ometimes con|&s;idered rather as the end than the beginning of an engagement: the attachment of each to the other is rather viewed as an object already completed, than as one which marriage is to confirm more clo&s;ely. But the companion for life is not always cho&s;en from the pure&s;t motive; &s;he is &s;elected, perhaps, becau&s;e &s;he is admired by other men, rather than becau&s;e &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in an eminent degree tho&s;e peculiar qualities which are likely to con&s;titute the individual happine&s;s of the man who choo&s;es her. Vanity u&s;urps the place of affection; and indolence &s;wallows up the judg|ment. Not happine&s;s, but &s;ome ea&s;y &s;ub&s;titute for happine&s;s, is pur&s;ued; and a choice which may ex|cite envy, rather than produce &s;atisfaction, is adopt|ed as the means of effecting it.</P>

while to &s;tand well with each other is con&s;idered as an under-part of the plot in the drama of life. Where|as, did they &s;tart in the conjugal race with the fixed idea that they were to look to each other for their chief worldly happine&s;s, not only principle, but pru|dence, and even &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, would convince them of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;edulou&s;ly cultivating each other's e&s;teem and affection as the grand means of promoting that happine&s;s. But vanity, and the de&s;ire of flat|tery and applau&s;e, &s;till continue to operate. Even after the hu&s;band is brought to feel a perfect indiffer|ence for his wife, he &s;till likes to &s;ee her decorated in a &s;tyle which may &s;erve to ju&s;tify his choice.

Thus is &s;he nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed to the two-fold temptation of being at once neglected by her hu&s;band, and exhibited as an object of attraction to other men.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>On public amu&s;ements.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is not propo&s;ed to enter the long conte&s;ted field of controver&s;y as to the individual amu&s;ements which may be con&s;idered as &s;afe and lawful for tho&s;e women of the higher cla&s;s who make a &s;trict profe&s;|&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity. The judgment they will be likely to form for them&s;elves on this &s;ubject, and the plan they will con&s;equently adopt, will depend much on the clearne&s;s or ob&s;curity of their religious views, and on the greater or le&s;s progre&s;s they have made in their Chri&s;tian cour&s;e. It is in their choice of amu&s;ements that you get in &s;ome mea&s;ure to know the real di&s;po&s;itions of mankind. In their <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> in the leading employments of life, their path is in a good degree chalked out for them: there is in this re&s;pect a &s;ort of general character wherein the greater part, more or le&s;s, mu&s;t coincide. But in their plea&s;ures the choice is voluntary, the ta&s;te is &s;elf-directed, the propen&s;ity is independent; and of cour&s;e the habitual &s;tate, the genuine bent and bias of the temper, are mo&s;t likely to be &s;een in tho&s;e pur&s;uits which every man is at liberty to choo&s;e for him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="037996_0346_100FAC92598FD2C0">
When a truly religious principle &s;hall have acquir|ed &s;uch a degree of force as to produce that con&s;ci|entious and habitual improvement of time before re|commended, it will di&s;cover it&s;elf by an increa&s;ing indifference and even deadne&s;s to tho&s;e plea&s;ures which are intere&s;ting to the world at large. A wo|man under the predominating influence of &s;uch a principle, will begin to di&s;cover that the &s;ame thing which in it&s;elf is innocent may yet be comparatively wrong. She will begin to feel that there are many amu&s;ements and employments which, though they have nothing cen&s;urable in them&s;elves, yet if they be allowed to entrench on hours which ought to be dedicated to &s;till better purpo&s;es; or if they are pro|tracted to an undue length; or above all, if by &s;oft|ening and relaxing her mind and di&s;&s;ipating her &s;pirits, they &s;o indi&s;po&s;e her for better pur&s;uits as to render &s;ub&s;equent duties a burden, become in that ca&s;e clearly wrong for her, whatever they may be for others. Now as temptations of this &s;ort are the peculiar dangers of better kind of characters, the &s;acrifice of &s;uch little gratifications as may <HI>have no great harm in them,</HI> come in among the daily calls to &s;elf-denial in a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>The fine arts, for in&s;tance, polite literature, elegant &s;ociety, the&s;e are among the lawful, and liberal, and becoming recreations of higher life; yet if even the&s;e be cultivated to the neglect or exclu&s;ion of &s;everer
<PB N="132" REF="037996_0347_100FAC9541880B48">
duties; if they interfere with &s;erious &s;tudies, or di&s;|qualify the mind for religious exerci&s;es, it is an inti|mation that they have been too much indulged; and, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, it might be the part of Chri&s;tian circum&s;pection to inquire if the time devot|ed to them ought not to be abridged. Above all, a tender con&s;cience will never lo&s;e &s;ight of one &s;afe rule of determining in all doubtful ca&s;es: if the point be &s;o nice that though we hope upon the whole there <HI>may</HI> be no harm in engaging in it, we may at lea&s;t be always quite &s;ure that there <HI>can</HI> be no harm in letting it alone. The adoption of this &s;imple rule would put a period to much unprofitable ca&s;ui&s;try.</P>
<P>The principle of being re&s;pon&s;ible for the u&s;e of time once fixed in the mind, the con&s;cientious Chri&s;|tian will be making a continual progre&s;s in the great art of turning time to account. In the fir&s;t &s;tages of her religion &s;he will have ab&s;tained from plea&s;ures which began a <HI>little</HI> to wound the con&s;cience, or which a&s;&s;umed a que&s;tionable &s;hape; but &s;he will probably have ab&s;tained with regret, and with a &s;ecret wi&s;h that con&s;cience <HI>could</HI> have permitted her to keep well with plea&s;ure and religion too. But you may di&s;cern in her &s;ub&s;equent cour&s;e that &s;he has reached a more advanced &s;tage, by her beginning to neglect even &s;uch plea&s;ures or employments as have no moral turpitude in them, but are merely what are called innocent. This relinqui&s;hment ari&s;es, not &s;o
<PB N="133" REF="037996_0348_100FAC97DC863B18">
much from her feeling &s;till more the re&s;traints of re|ligion, as from the improvement in her religious ta&s;te. Plea&s;ures cannot now attach her merely from their being innocent, unle&s;s they are intere&s;ting al&s;o, and to be intere&s;ting they mu&s;t be con&s;onant to her &s;uperinduced views. She is not contented to &s;pend a large portion of her time harmle&s;sly, it mu&s;t be &s;pent profitably al&s;o. Nay, if &s;he be indeed earne&s;tly <Q>pre&s;&s;|ing towards the mark,</Q> it will not be even enough for her that her pre&s;ent pur&s;uit be good, if &s;he be convinced that it might be &s;till better. Her contempt of ordinary enjoyments will increa&s;e in a direct pro|portion to her increa&s;ed reli&s;h for tho&s;e plea&s;ures which religion enjoins and be&s;tows. So that at length if it were po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e that an angel could come down to take off as it were the interdict, and to in|vite her to re&s;ume all the plea&s;ures &s;he had renounced, and to re&s;ume them with complete impunity, &s;he would reject the invitation, becau&s;e &s;he would de&s;pi&s;e, from an improvement in her &s;piritual ta&s;te, tho&s;e de|lights from which &s;he had at fir&s;t ab&s;tained through fear. Till her will and affections come heartily to be engaged in the &s;ervice of God, the progre&s;s will not be comfortable; but when once they are &s;o en|gaged, the attachment to this &s;ervice will be cordial, and her heart will not de&s;ire to go back and toil again in the drudgery of the world. For her religion has

but with the very &s;pirit of worldly plea&s;ure. They do not con&s;ider that Chri&s;tianity is neither a table of ethics, nor a &s;y&s;tem of opinions, nor a bundle of rods to puni&s;h, nor an exhibition of rewards to allure, nor a &s;cheme of re&s;traints, nor merely a code of laws; but it is a new principle infu&s;ed into the heart by the word and the &s;pirit of God, out of which principle will inevitably grow right opinions, renewed affec|tions, correct morals, and holy habits, with an in|variable de&s;ire of plea&s;ing God, and a con&s;tant fear of offending him. A real Chri&s;tian, who&s;e heart is once thoroughly imbued with this principle, can no more return to the amu&s;ements of the world, than a philo&s;opher can be refre&s;hed with the diver&s;ions of the vulgar, or a man be amu&s;ed with the recreations of a child. The New Te&s;tament is not a mere &s;ta|tute-book: it is not a table where every offence is de|tailed, and its corre&s;ponding penalty annexed: it is not &s;o much a <HI>compilation,</HI> as a <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of laws: it does not &s;o much prohibit every individual wrong practice, as &s;ugge&s;t a temper and general principle with which every wrong practice is incompatible.

&s;ermon, narrowed his &s;ubject to a remon&s;trance again&s;t this diver&s;ion, or that public place, or the other vain amu&s;ement, it might indeed have &s;uited the ca&s;e of &s;ome of the female Jewi&s;h converts who were at pre&s;ent; but &s;uch re&s;trictions as might have been appropriate to them, would probably not have applied to the ca&s;es of the Parthians and Medes, of which his audience was partly compo&s;ed; or &s;uch as might have belonged to them would have been totally inapplicable to the Cretes and Arabians; or again, tho&s;e which &s;uited the&s;e would not have ap|plied to the Elamites and Me&s;opotamians. By &s;uch partial and circum&s;cribed addre&s;&s;es, his multifarious audience, compo&s;ed of all nations and countries, would not have been, as we are told they were, "pricked to the heart." But when he preached on the broad ground of general <Q>repentance and remi&s;|&s;ion of &s;ins in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</Q> it was no wonder that they all cried out <Q>What &s;hall we do?</Q> The&s;e collected foreigners, at their return home, mu&s;t have found very different u&s;ages to be corrected in their different countries; of cour&s;e a de|tailed re&s;triction of the popular abu&s;es at Jeru&s;alem, would have been of little u&s;e to &s;trangers returning to their re&s;pective nations. The ardent Apo&s;tle, therefore, acted more con&s;i&s;tently in communicating to them the large and comprehen&s;ive &s;pirit of the Go&s;pel, which &s;hould at once involve all their &s;cat|tered

and &s;eparate duties, as well as reprove all their &s;cattered and &s;eparate corruptions; for the whole always includes a part, and the greater involves the le&s;s. Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples, in&s;tead of limiting their condemnation to the peculiar vanities repre|hended by I&s;aiah, embraced the very &s;oul and princi|ple of them all, in &s;uch exhortations as the follow|ing: "Be ye not conformed to the world:"&mdash;<Q>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him:</Q>&mdash;<Q>The fa&s;hion of this world pa&s;&s;eth away.</Q> Our Lord and his Apo&s;tles, who&s;e future unlimited audience was to be made up out of the whole world, attacked the evil <HI>heart,</HI> out of which all tho&s;e incidental, local, and popular corruptions proceeded.</P>
<P>In the time of Chri&s;t and his immediate followers, the luxury and intemperance of the Romans had ari&s;en to a pitch before unknown in the world; but as the &s;ame Go&s;pel which its Divine Author and his di&s;ciples were then preaching to the hungry and ne|ce&s;&s;itous, was afterwards to be preached to high and low, not excepting the Roman Emperors them&s;elves; the large precept, <Q>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God,</Q> was likely to be of more general u&s;e, than any &s;epa|rate exhortation to temperance, to thankfulne&s;s, to moderation as to quantity or expence; which la&s;t in|deed

mu&s;t always be left in &s;ome degree to the judg|ment and circum&s;tances of the individual.</P>
<P>When the Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles vi&s;ited the "Saints of Cae&s;ar's hou&s;ehold," he could hardly fail to have heard, nor could he have heard without ab|horrence, of &s;ome of the fa&s;hionable amu&s;ements in the court of Nero. He mu&s;t have reflected with pe|culiar indignation on many things which were prac|ti&s;ed in the Circen&s;ian games: yet, in&s;tead of prun|ing this corrupt tree, and &s;ingling out even the in|human gladiatorial &s;ports for the object of his con|demnation, he laid his axe to the root of all &s;in, by preaching to them that Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t of which "he was not a&s;hamed;" and &s;hewing to them that believed, that <Q>it was the power of God and the wi&s;dom of God.</Q> It is &s;omewhat remarkable, that about the very time of his preaching to the Ro|mans, the public ta&s;te had &s;unk to &s;uch an exce&s;s of depravity, that the very women engaged in tho&s;e &s;hocking encounters with the gladiators.</P>
<P>But, in the fir&s;t place, it was better that their right practice &s;hould grow out of the right prin|ciple; and next, his &s;pecifically reprobating the&s;e diver&s;ions might have had this ill effect, that &s;ucceed|ing ages, &s;eeing that they in their amu&s;ements came &s;omewhat &s;hort of tho&s;e dreadful exce&s;&s;es of the po|li&s;hed Romans, would only have plumed them&s;elves on their own comparative &s;uperiority; and on this
<PB N="141" REF="037996_0356_100FACADC63C5040">
principle, even the bull-fights of Madrid might have had their panegyri&s;ts. The truth is, the Apo&s;tle knew that &s;uch abominable corruptions could never &s;ub&s;i&s;t together with Chri&s;tianity, and in fact, the honour of aboli&s;hing the&s;e barbarous diver&s;ions, was re&s;erved for Con&s;tantine, the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian emperor.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Apo&s;tles, by inveighing again&s;t &s;ome <HI>particular</HI> diver&s;ions might have &s;eemed to &s;anction all which they did not actually cen&s;ure: and as, in the lap&s;e of time and the revolution of governments, cu&s;toms change and manners fluctuate; had a mi|nute reprehen&s;ion of the fa&s;hions of the then exi&s;ting age been publi&s;hed in the New Te&s;tament, that por|tion of &s;cripture mu&s;t in time have become ob&s;olete, even in that very &s;ame country, when the fa&s;hions them&s;elves &s;hould have changed. Paul and his bro|ther Apo&s;tles knew that their epi&s;tles would be the oracles of the Chri&s;tian world, when the&s;e tempora|ry diver&s;ions would be forgotten. In con&s;equence of this knowledge, by the univer&s;al precept to avoid <Q>the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life,</Q> they have prepared a la&s;ting antidote again&s;t the <HI>principle</HI> of all corrupt plea&s;ures, which will ever remain equally applicable to the loo&s;e fa&s;hi|ons of all ages, and of every country, to the end of the world.</P>
<P>Therefore to vindicate diver&s;ions, which are in them&s;elves unchri&s;tian, on the pretended ground that
<PB N="142" REF="037996_0357_100FACAF4E0B4A88">
they are not &s;pecifically condemned in the go&s;pel, would be little le&s;s ab&s;urd than if the heroes of New-market &s;hould bring it as a proof that their periodi|cal meetings are not condemned in Scripture, becau&s;e St. Paul, when writing to the Corinthians, did not &s;peak again&s;t the&s;e, or becau&s;e in availing him&s;elf of the I&s;thmian games, as a happy illu&s;tration of the Chri&s;tian race, he did not drop any cen&s;ure on the practice it&s;elf: a practice which was indeed as much more pure than the races of Chri&s;tian Britain, as the moderation of being contented with the triumph of a crown of leaves, is &s;uperior to that criminal &s;pirit of gambling which iniquitou&s;ly enriches the victor by beggaring the competitor.</P>
<P>Local abu&s;es, as we have &s;aid, were not the ob|ject of a book who&s;e in&s;tructions were to be of uni|ver&s;al and la&s;ting application. As a proof of this, little is &s;aid in the Go&s;pel of the then prevailing cor|ruption of polygamy; nothing again&s;t the &s;avage cu&s;tom of expo&s;ing children, or even again&s;t &s;lavery; nothing expre&s;sly again&s;t &s;uicide or duelling; the la&s;t Gothic cu&s;tom, indeed, did not exi&s;t among the crimes of <HI>Pagani&s;m.</HI> But is there not an implied prohibition again&s;t polygamy in the general denuncia|tion again&s;t adultery? Is not expo&s;ing of children con|demned in that charge again&s;t the Romans, that "they were without natural affection?" Is there not a &s;trong cen&s;ure again&s;t &s;lavery conveyed in the com|mand
<PB N="143" REF="037996_0358_100FACB2490E5C00">
to <Q>do unto others as you would have them do unto you?</Q> and again&s;t &s;uicide and duelling, in the general prohibition again&s;t murder, which is &s;trongly enforced by the &s;olemn manner in which murder is traced back to its fir&s;t &s;eed of anger, in the &s;ermon on the mount?</P>
<P>Thus it is clear, that when Chri&s;t &s;ent the Go&s;pel to all nations, he meant that that Go&s;pel &s;hould proclaim tho&s;e prime truths, general laws, and fundamental doctrines, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily involve the prohi|bition of all individual, local, and inferior errors; errors which could not have been &s;pecifically guard|ed again&s;t, without having a di&s;tinct Go&s;pel for eve|ry country, or without &s;welling the divine volume into &s;uch inconvenient length as would have defeat|ed one great end of its promulgation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"To the <HI>poor</HI> the Go&s;pel is preached." Luke, vii. 22.</NOTE>. And while its leading principles are of univer&s;al application, it mu&s;t always, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be left to the di&s;cre|tion of the preacher, and to the con&s;cience of the hearer, to examine whether the life and habits of tho&s;e who profe&s;s it are conformable to its &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Divine Spirit which indited the Holy Scriptures, is promi&s;ed to purify the hearts and re|new the natures of repenting and believing Chri&s;tians; and the compo&s;itions it in&s;pired are in &s;ome degree analogous to the workman&s;hip it effects. It prohibit|ed
<PB N="144" REF="037996_0359_100FACB4F15983B0">
the vicious practices of the apo&s;tolical days, by prohibiting the pa&s;&s;ions and principles which ren|dered them gratifying; and &s;till working in like manner on the hearts of real Chri&s;tians, it corrects the ta&s;te which was accu&s;tomed to find its proper gratification in the re&s;orts of vanity; and thus ef|fectually provides for the reformation of the habits, and infu&s;es a reli&s;h for rational and dome&s;tic enjoy|ments, and for whatever can admini&s;ter plea&s;ure to that &s;pirit of peace, and love, and hope, and joy, which animates and rules the renewed heart of the true Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>But there is a portion of Scripture which, though to a &s;uperficial reader it may &s;eem but very remotely connected with the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, yet to readers of another ca&s;t, &s;eems to &s;ettle the matter beyond con|trover&s;y: In the parable of the great &s;upper, this important truth is held out to us, that even things <HI>good in them&s;elves</HI> may be the means of our eternal ruin, by drawing our hearts from God, and cau&s;ing us to make light of the offers of the Go&s;pel. One invited gue&s;t had bought an e&s;tate, another had made a purcha&s;e equally blamele&s;s of oxen; a third had married a wife, an act not illaudable in it&s;elf. They had all different rea&s;ons; but they all agreed in this, <HI>to decline the invitation to the &s;upper.</HI> The worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of one, the worldly bu&s;ine&s;s of another, and what &s;hould be particularly attended to, the love
<PB N="145" REF="037996_0360_100FACB8A467E688">
to his deare&s;t relative, of a third, (a love by the way not only allowed but commanded in Scripture) were brought forward as excu&s;es for not attending to the important bu&s;ine&s;s of religion. The con&s;equence, however, was the &s;ame to all. <Q>None of tho&s;e which were bidden &s;hall ta&s;te of my &s;upper.</Q> If then things <HI>innocent,</HI> things <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> things <HI>laudable,</HI> things <HI>commanded,</HI> become &s;inful, when by un&s;ea&s;ona|ble or exce&s;&s;ive indulgence they detain the heart and affections from God, how vain will all tho&s;e argu|ments nece&s;&s;arily be rendered, which are urged by the advocates for certain amu&s;ements, on the ground of their <HI>harmle&s;&s;ne&s;s;</HI> if tho&s;e amu&s;ements &s;erve (not to mention any po&s;itive evil which may belong to them) in like manner to draw away the thoughts and affections from all &s;piritual objects!</P>
<P>To conclude; when this topic happens to become the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation, in&s;tead of addre&s;&s;ing &s;evere and pointed attacks to young ladies on the &s;in of attending places of diver&s;ion, would it not be bet|ter fir&s;t to endeavour to excite in them that principle of Chri&s;tianity, with which &s;uch diver&s;ions &s;eem not quite compatible; as the phy&s;ician, who vi&s;its a pa|tient in an eruptive fever, pays little attention to tho&s;e &s;pots which to the ignorant appear to be the di&s;ea&s;e, except indeed &s;o far as they &s;erve as indications to let him into its nature, but goes &s;traight to the root of the malady? He attacks the fever, he lowers
<PB N="146" REF="037996_0361_100FACBA2B4587A8">
the pul&s;e, he changes the &s;y&s;tem, he corrects the general habit; well knowing that if he can but re|&s;tore the vital principle of health, the &s;pots, which were nothing but &s;ymptoms, will die away of them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>In in&s;tructing others we &s;hould imitate our Lord and his Apo&s;tles, and not always aim our blow at each particular corruption; but making it our bu&s;i|ne&s;s to convince our pupil that what brings forth the evil fruit &s;he exhibits, cannot be a branch of the true vine; we &s;hould thus avail our&s;elves of individual corruptions, for impre&s;&s;ing her with a &s;en&s;e of the nece&s;&s;ity of purifying the common &s;ource from which they flow&mdash;a corrupt nature. Thus making it our grand bu&s;ine&s;s to rectify the heart, we pur&s;ue the true, the compendious, the only method of univer&s;al holine&s;s.</P>
<P>I would, however, take leave of tho&s;e amiable and not ill-di&s;po&s;ed young per&s;ons, who complain of the rigour of human prohibitions, and declare <Q>they meet with no &s;uch &s;trictne&s;s in the Go&s;pel,</Q> by a&s;king them, with the mo&s;t affectionate earne&s;tne&s;s, if they can con&s;cientiou&s;ly reconcile their nightly at|tendance at every public place which they frequent, with &s;uch precepts as the following: <Q>Redeeming the time:</Q>&mdash;"Watch and pray:"&mdash;<Q>Watch, for ye know not at what time your Lord cometh:</Q>&mdash;"Ab&s;tain from all <HI>appearance</HI> of evil:"&mdash;<Q>Set your

affections on things above;</Q>&mdash;<Q>Be ye &s;piritually minded:</Q>&mdash;<Q>Crucify the fle&s;h with its affections and lu&s;ts?</Q> And I would venture to offer one criterion, by which the per&s;ons in que&s;tion may be enabled to decide on the po&s;itive innocence and &s;afety of &s;uch diver&s;ions; I mean, provided they are &s;incere in their &s;crutiny and hone&s;t in their avowal. If on their return at night from tho&s;e places they find they can retire, and <Q>commune with their own hearts;</Q> if they find the love of God ope|rating with undimini&s;hed force on their minds; if they can "bring every thought into &s;ubjection," and concentrate every wandering imagination; if they can &s;oberly examine into their own &s;tate of mind: I do not &s;ay if they can do all this perfectly and with|out di&s;traction; (for who can do this at any time?) but if they can do it with the &s;ame <HI>degree</HI> of &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s, pray with the &s;ame <HI>degree</HI> of fervour, and re|nounce the world in as great a <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> as at other times; and if they can lie down with a peaceful con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having avoided in the evening <Q>that temptation</Q> which they had prayed not to be <Q>led into</Q> in the morning, they may then more rea&s;on|ably hope that all is well, and that they are not &s;peaking fal&s;e peace to their hearts.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If I might pre&s;ume to recommend a book which of all others expo&s;es the in&s;ignificance, vanity, littlene&s;s, and emptine&s;s of the world, I &s;hould not he&s;itate to name Mr. Law's <HI><Q>Serious Call to a devout and holy Life.</Q></HI> Few writers, except Pa&s;cal, have directed &s;o much acutene&s;s of rea&s;oning, and &s;o much pointed wit to this object. He not only makes the reader afraid of a worldly life on account of its &s;infulne&s;s, but a&s;hamed of it on account of its folly. Few men perhaps have had a deeper in&s;ight into the human heart, or have more &s;kilfully probed its corruptions: yet on points of doctrine his views do not &s;eem to be ju&s;t; and his di&s;qui&s;itions are often un&s;ound and fanciful; &s;o that a <HI>general</HI> peru&s;al of his works would neither be profitable or intelligible. To a fa&s;hionable wo|man immer&s;ed in the vanities of life, or to a bu&s;y man overwhelm|ed with its cares, I know no book &s;o applicable, or likely to exhibit with equal force the vanity of the &s;hadows they are pur&s;uing. But even in this work he is not a &s;afe guide to evangelical light; and in many of his others he is highly vi&s;ionary and whim&s;ical: and I have known &s;ome excellent per&s;ons who were fir&s;t led by this ad|mirable genius to &s;ee the wants of their own hearts, and the utter in&s;ufficiency of the world to fill up the craving void, who, though they became eminent for piety and &s;elf-denial, have had their u&s;e|fulne&s;s abridged, and who&s;e minds have contracted &s;omething of a mona&s;tic &s;everity by an unqualified peru&s;al of Mr. Law. True Chri&s;tianity does not call on us to &s;tarve our bodies, but our cor|ruptions. As the <HI>mortified Apo&s;tle of the holy and &s;elf-denying Bapti&s;t,</HI> preaching repentance becau&s;e the kingdom of Heaven is at hand, Mr. Law has no &s;uperior.

<P>Is it not whim&s;ical to hear &s;uch complaints again&s;t the &s;trictne&s;s of religion as we are frequently hearing, from beings who are voluntarily pur&s;uing, as has been &s;hewn in the preceding Chapters, a cour&s;e of life which Fa&s;hion makes infinitely more laborious? How really burden&s;ome would Chri&s;tianity be if &s;he enjoined &s;uch &s;edulous application, &s;uch unremitting labours, &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fatigues! if religion commanded &s;uch hard&s;hips and &s;elf-denial, &s;uch days of hurry, &s;uch evenings of exertion, &s;uch nights of broken re&s;t, &s;uch perpetual &s;acrifices of quiet, &s;uch exile from family delights, as Fa&s;hion impo&s;es, then indeed the &s;ervice of Chri&s;tianity would no longer merit its pre&s;ent appellation of being a <Q><HI>rea&s;onable</HI> &s;ervice:</Q> then the name of perfect &s;lavery might be ju&s;tly applied to that which we are told in the beau|tiful language of our church, is <Q>a &s;ervice of perfect freedom:</Q> a &s;ervice, the great object of which is <Q>to deliver us from the bondage of

corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</Q></P>
<P>A worldly temper, by which I mean a di&s;po&s;ition to prefer worldly plea&s;ures, worldly &s;atisfactions, and worldly advantages, to the immortal intere&s;ts of the &s;oul; and to let worldly con&s;iderations actuate us in&s;tead of the dictates of religion in the concerns of ordinary life; a worldly temper, I &s;ay, is not, like almo&s;t any other fault, the effect of pa&s;&s;ion or the con&s;equence of &s;urpri&s;e when the heart is off its guard. It is not excited incidentally by the opera|tion of external circum&s;tances on the infirmity of na|ture; but it is the vital &s;pirit, the e&s;&s;ential &s;oul, the living principle of evil. It is not &s;o much an act, as a &s;tate of being; not &s;o much an occa&s;ional com|plaint, as a tainted con&s;titution of mind. If it do not always &s;how it&s;elf in extraordinary exce&s;&s;es, it has no perfect intermi&s;&s;ion. Even when it is not immediately tempted to break out into overt and &s;pe|cific acts, it is at work within, &s;tirring up the heart to di&s;affection again&s;t holine&s;s, and infu&s;ing a kind of moral di&s;ability to whatever is intrin&s;ically good. It infects and depraves all the powers and faculties of the &s;oul; for it operates on the under&s;tanding by blinding it to whatever is &s;piritually good; on the will, by making it aver&s;e from God; on the affec|tions, by di&s;ordering and &s;en&s;ualizing them; &s;o that one may almo&s;t &s;ay to tho&s;e who are under the &s;u|preme

dominion of this &s;pirit, what was &s;aid to the ho&s;ts of Jo&s;hua, "Ye <HI>cannot</HI> &s;erve the Lord."</P>
<P>This worldline&s;s of mind is not at all commonly under&s;tood, and for the following rea&s;on:&mdash;People &s;uppo&s;e that in this world our chief bu&s;ine&s;s is with the things of this world, and that to conduct the bu&s;ine&s;s of this world well, that is, conformably to moral principles, is the chief &s;ub&s;tance of moral and true goodne&s;s. Religion, if introduced at all into the &s;y&s;tem, only makes its occa&s;ional, and if I may &s;o &s;peak, its holiday appearance. To bring re|ligion into every thing, is thought incompatible with the due attention to the things of this life. And &s;o it would be, if by religion were meant <HI>talking</HI> about religion. The phra&s;e, therefore, is: <Q>One cannot always be praying; we mu&s;t mind our bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;ocial duties as well as our devotion.</Q> Worldly bu&s;ine&s;s being thus &s;ubjected to worldly, though in &s;ome degree moral, maxims, the mind during the conduct of bu&s;ine&s;s grows worldly; and a continual|ly increa&s;ing worldly &s;pirit dims the &s;ight and relaxes the moral principle on which the affairs of the world are conducted, as well as indi&s;po&s;es the mind for all the exerci&s;es of devotion.</P>
<P>But this temper, as far as relates to <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> a&s;|&s;umes the &s;emblance of goodne&s;s; &s;o that tho&s;e who have not right views are apt to mi&s;take the carrying on the affairs of life on a tolerably moral principle,
<PB N="152" REF="037996_0367_100FACC7DEAC14D0">
for religion. They do not &s;ee that the evil lies not in their &s;o carrying on bu&s;ine&s;s, but in their not carrying on the things of this life in &s;ub&s;erviency to tho&s;e of eternity; in their not carrying them on with the unintermitting idea of re&s;pon&s;ibility. The evil does not lie in their not being always on their knees, but in their not bringing their religion from the clo&s;et into the world: in their not bringing the &s;pirit of the Sunday's devotions into the tran&s;actions of the week: in not transforming their religion from a dry, and &s;peculative, and inoperative &s;y&s;tem, into a live|ly, and influential, and uncea&s;ing principle of action.</P>
<P>Though there are, ble&s;&s;ed be God! in the mo&s;t exalted &s;tations, women who adorn their Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion by a con&s;i&s;tent conduct; yet are there not others who are labouring hard to unite the irrecon|cilable intere&s;ts of earth and heaven? who, while they will not relinqui&s;h one jot of what this world has to be&s;tow, yet by no means renounce their hopes of a better? who do not think it unrea&s;onable that their indulging in the fulle&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of pre&s;ent plea&s;ure &s;hould interfere with the mo&s;t certain re|ver&s;ion of future glory? who, after living in the mo&s;t unbounded gratification of ea&s;e, vanity, and luxury, fancy that heaven mu&s;t be attached of cour&s;e to a life of which Chri&s;tianity is the outward profe&s;&s;ion, and which has not been &s;tained by any flagrant or di&s;honourable act of guilt?</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="037996_0368_100FACCAB0188000">
Are there not many who, while they entertain a re&s;pect for religion, (for I addre&s;s not the unbeliev|ing or the licentious,) while they believe its truths, ob&s;erve its forms, and would be &s;hocked not to be thought religious, are yet immer&s;ed in this life of di&s;qualifying worldline&s;s? who, though they make a con&s;cience of going to the public wor&s;hip once on a Sunday, and are &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;ervant of the other rites of the Church, yet he&s;itate not to give up all the re&s;t of their time to the very &s;ame pur&s;uits and plea&s;ures which occupy the hearts and lives of tho&s;e loo&s;er characters who&s;e enjoyment is not ob|&s;tructed by any dread of a future account? and who are acting on the wi&s;e principle of <Q>the children of this world</Q> in making the mo&s;t of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of being from the conviction that there is no other to be expected?</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned, indeed, that faith in un&s;een things is at times &s;adly weak and defective even in the truly pious; and that it is &s;o, is the &s;ubject of their grief and humiliation. O! how does the real Chri&s;tian take &s;hame in the coldne&s;s of his belief, in the lowne&s;s of his attainments! How deeply does he lament that <Q>when he would do good, evil is pre&s;ent with him!</Q>&mdash;<Q>that the life he now lives in the fle&s;h, is</Q> not, in the degree it ought to be, "by faith in the &s;on of God!" Yet one thing is clear; however weak his belief may &s;eem to be, it is
<PB N="154" REF="037996_0369_100FACCE70654C28">
evident that his actions are mainly governed by it; he evinces his &s;incerity to others by a life in &s;ome good degree analogous to the doctrines he profe&s;&s;es: while to him&s;elf he has this conviction, that faint as his confidence may be at times, yet at the wor&s;t of times he would not exchange that faint mea&s;ure of tru&s;t and hope for all the actual plea&s;ures and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions of his mo&s;t &s;plendid acquaintance; and as a proof of his &s;incerity he never &s;eeks the cure of his dejection, where they &s;eek theirs, in the world, but in God.</P>
<P>But as to the faith of worldly per&s;ons, however &s;trong it may be in &s;peculation, however orthodox their creed, one cannot help fearing that it is a little defective in &s;incerity: for if there were in the mind a full per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth of revelation, and of the eternal bli&s;s it promi&s;es, would it not be obvious to them that there mu&s;t be more diligence for its at|tainment? We di&s;cover great ardor in carrying on worldly projects, becau&s;e we believe the good which we are pur&s;uing is real, and will reward the trouble of the pur&s;uit: we believe that good to be attaina|ble by diligence, and prudently proportion our ear|ne&s;tne&s;s to this conviction: and therefore where we &s;ee per&s;ons profe&s;&s;ing a lively faith in a better world, yet labouring little to obtain an intere&s;t in it, can we forbear &s;u&s;pecting that their belief, not only of their own title to eternal happine&s;s, but of eter|nal
<PB N="155" REF="037996_0370_100FACD1179765F0">
happine&s;s it&s;elf, is not well grounded? and that, if they were to "examine them&s;elves truly," the faith would be found to be much of a piece with the practice?</P>
<P>Even that very ta&s;te for enjoyment which leads the per&s;ons in que&s;tion to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the qualifications for the plea&s;ures of the pre&s;ent &s;cene; that under&s;tanding which leads them to acquire &s;uch talents as may enable them to reli&s;h the re|&s;orts of gaiety here, &s;hould induce tho&s;e who are really looking for a future &s;tate of happine&s;s, to wi&s;h to acquire &s;omething of the ta&s;te, and temper, and talents, which may be con&s;idered as qualifica|tions for its enjoyment. The neglect to do this mu&s;t proceed from one of the&s;e two cau&s;es; either they mu&s;t think their pre&s;ent cour&s;e a &s;afe and pro|per cour&s;e; or they mu&s;t think that death is to pro|duce &s;ome &s;udden and &s;urpri&s;ing alteration in the human character. But the office of death is to tran&s;port us to a new &s;tate, not to transform us to a new nature: the &s;troke of death is intended to effect our deliverance out of this world, and our introduction into another; but it is not likely to effect any &s;udden and &s;urpri&s;ing or total change in our hearts or our ta&s;tes: &s;o far from this, that we are a&s;&s;ured in Scripture, <Q>that he that is filthy will be filthy &s;till, and he that is holy will be holy &s;till.</Q> Though we believe that death will complete|ly
<PB N="156" REF="037996_0371_100FACD2A1B6F370">
clean&s;e the holy &s;oul from its remaining pollutions, that it will exchange defective &s;anctification into per|fect purity, entangling temptation into complete free|dom, want and pain into health and fruition, doubts and fears into perfect &s;ecurity, and oppre&s;&s;ive wearine&s;s into everla&s;ting re&s;t; yet there is no magic in the wand of death which will convert an unholy &s;oul into a holy one. And it is awful to reflect, that &s;uch tempers as have the allowed predominance here will maintain it for ever; that &s;uch as the will is when we clo&s;e our eyes upon the things of time, &s;uch it will be when we open them on tho&s;e of eter|nity. The mere act of death no more fits us for heaven, than the mere act of the ma&s;on who pulls down our old hou&s;e fits us for a new one. If we die with our hearts running over with the love of the world, there is no promi&s;e to lead us to expect that we &s;hall ri&s;e with them full of the love of God: death indeed will &s;hew us to our&s;elves &s;uch as we are, but will not make us &s;uch as we are not: and it will be too late to be acquiring &s;elf-knowledge when we can no longer turn it to any account but that of tormenting our&s;elves. To illu&s;trate this truth &s;till farther by an allu&s;ion familiar to the per&s;ons I addre&s;s: the drawing up the curtain at the theatre, though it &s;erves to intro|duce us to the entertainments behind it, does not create in us any new faculties to under&s;tand or to
<PB N="157" REF="037996_0372_100FACD55559A708">
reli&s;h tho&s;e entertainments: the&s;e mu&s;t have been long in acquiring: they mu&s;t have been provided beforehand, and brought with us to the place, if we would reli&s;h the plea&s;ures of it; for the entertain|ment can only operate on that ta&s;te we carry to it. It is too late to be acquiring when we ought to be enjoying.</P>
<P>That &s;pirit of prayer and prai&s;e, tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of love, meekne&s;s, <Q>peace, quietne&s;s, and a&s;&s;ur|ance;</Q> that indifference to the fa&s;hion of a world which is pa&s;&s;ing away; that longing after deliver|ance from &s;in, that de&s;ire of holine&s;s, together with all the &s;pecific marks of our having <Q>the fruits of the &s;pirit</Q> here, mu&s;t &s;urely make &s;ome part of our qualification for the enjoyment of a world, the plea|&s;ures of which are all &s;piritual. And who can con|ceive any thing comparable to the awful &s;urpri&s;e of a &s;oul long immer&s;ed in the indulgences of vanity and plea&s;ure, yet all the while lulled by the &s;elf-compla|cency of a religion of mere forms: who, while it counted upon heaven as a thing of cour&s;e, had made no preparation for it! Who can conceive any &s;ur|pri&s;e comparable to that of &s;uch a &s;oul on &s;hutting its eyes on a world of &s;en&s;e, of which all the objects and delights were &s;o congenial to its nature, and open|ing them on a world of &s;pirits of which all the cha|racters of enjoyment are of a nature new, unknown, &s;urpri&s;ing, and &s;pecifically different? plea&s;ures more

inconceivable to its apprehen&s;ion and more un&s;uitable to its ta&s;te, than the gratifications of one &s;en&s;e are to the organs of another, or than the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite works of genius to ab&s;olute imbecility of mind.</P>
<P>While we would with deep humility confe&s;s that we cannot purcha&s;e heaven by any works or right di&s;po&s;itions of our own; while we gratefully ac|knowledge that it mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed for us by <Q>Him who loved us, and wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his blood;</Q> yet let us remember that we have no rea&s;on to expect we could be capable of enjoying the plea|&s;ures of a heaven &s;o purcha&s;ed without heavenly mind|edne&s;s. When tho&s;e per&s;ons who are apt to expect as much comfort from religion as if their hearts were not full of the world, now and then, in a fit of ho|ne&s;ty or low &s;pirits, complain that Chri&s;tianity does not make them as good and as happy as they were led to expect from that a&s;&s;urance, that <Q>great peace have they who love the Lord,</Q> and that <Q>they who wait on him &s;hall want no manner of thing that is good;</Q> when they lament that the paths of religion are not tho&s;e "paths of plea&s;antne&s;s" they were led to expect; their ca&s;e reminds one of a cele|brated phy&s;ician, who u&s;ed to &s;ay, that the rea&s;on why his pre&s;criptions, which commonly cured the poor and the temperate, did &s;o little good among his rich luxurious patients, was, that while he was la|bouring to remove the di&s;ea&s;e by medicines, of which
<PB N="159" REF="037996_0374_100FACDBAB7EB460">
they only took drams, grains, and &s;cruples; they were inflaming it by a multiplicity of injurious ali|ments, which they &s;wallowed by ounces, pounds, and pints.</P>
<P>The&s;e fa&s;hionable Chri&s;tians &s;hould be reminded, that there was no half engagement made for them at their bapti&s;m; that they are not partly their own and partly their Redeemer's. He that is <Q>bought with a price,</Q> is the &s;ole property of the purcha&s;er. Faith does not con&s;i&s;t merely in &s;ubmitting the opinions of the under&s;tanding, but the di&s;po&s;itions of the heart: religion is not a &s;acrifice of &s;entiments, but of affec|tions: it is not the tribute of fear extorted from a &s;lave, but the voluntary homage of love paid by a child.</P>
<P>Neither does a Chri&s;tian's piety con&s;i&s;t in living in retreat, and railing at the practices of the world, while, perhaps, her heart is full of the &s;pirit of that world at which &s;he is rai&s;ing: but it con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>&s;ub|duing</HI> the &s;pirit of the world and oppo&s;ing its prac|tices, even while her duty obliges her to live in it.</P>
<P>Nor is the &s;pirit or the love of the world confined to tho&s;e only who are making a figure in it; nor are its operations bounded by the precincts of the metro|polis, nor the limited regions of fir&s;t-rate rank and &s;plendor.

fortune compels her to take up with the &s;econd-hand plea&s;ures of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive watering-places, which plea&s;ures &s;he pur&s;ues with avidity, is governed by the &s;ame &s;pirit: and &s;he who&s;e &s;till narrower opportuni|ties &s;tint her to the petty diver&s;ions of her provincial town, if &s;he be bu&s;ied in &s;welling and enlarging her &s;maller &s;phere of vanity and idlene&s;s, however &s;he may comfort her&s;elf with her own comparative good|ne&s;s, by railing at the unattainable plea&s;ures of the watering-place, or the &s;till more unapproachable joys of the capital, is governed by the &s;ame &s;pirit: for &s;he who is as vain, as di&s;&s;ipated, and as extravagant as actual circum&s;tances admit, would be as vain, as di&s;|&s;ipated, and as extravagant as the gaye&s;t objects of her invective now are, if &s;he could change places with them. It is not merely by what we do that we can be &s;ure the &s;pirit of the world has no dominion over us, but by fairly con&s;idering what we &s;hould proba|bly do if more were in our power.</P>
<P>The worldly Chri&s;tian, if I may be allowed &s;uch a contradiction in terms, mu&s;t not imagine that &s;he ac|quits her&s;elf of her religious obligations by her mere weekly oblation of prayer. There is no covenant by which communion with God is re&s;tricted to an hour or two on the Sunday: &s;he does not acquit her&s;elf by &s;etting apart a few particular days in the year for the exerci&s;e of a periodical devotion, and then flying back to the world as eagerly as if &s;he were re&s;olved to re|pay

For is it not among the delu&s;ions of a worldly piety to con&s;ider Chri&s;tianity as a thing which cannot, in|deed, &s;afely be omitted, but which is to <HI>be got over;</HI> a certain quantity of which is, as it were, to be taken in the lump, with long intervals between the repeti|tions? to con&s;ider religion as impo&s;ing a &s;et of hard|&s;hips, which <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be occa&s;ionally encountered in or|der to procure a peaceable enjoyment of the long re&s;pite? that the&s;e &s;evere conditions thus fulfilled, the acquitted Chri&s;tian having paid the annual de|mand of a rigorous requi&s;ition, &s;he may now law|fully return to her natural &s;tate; and the old reckon|ing being adju&s;ted, &s;he may begin a new &s;core, and receive the reward of her punctual obedience, in the re&s;umed indulgence of tho&s;e gratifications which &s;he had for a &s;hort time laid a&s;ide as a hard ta&s;k to plea&s;e a hard ma&s;ter: but this ta&s;k performed, and the ma&s;ter appea&s;ed, the mind may di&s;cover its natu|ral

bent, in joyfully returning to the objects of its real choice? Whereas, is it not clear on the other hand, that if the religious exerci&s;es had produced the effect which it is the nature of true religion to pro|duce, the penitent <HI>could</HI> not return with her old ge|nuine alacrity to tho&s;e habits of the world, from which the pious weekly manuals through which &s;he has been labouring with the punctuality of an alma|nac as to the day, and the accuracy of a beadroll as to the number, was intended by the devout authors to re&s;cue their reader?</P>
<P>I am far from in&s;inuating that this literal &s;eque&s;|tration ought to be prolonged throughout the year, or that all the days of bu&s;ine&s;s are to be made equal|ly days of &s;olemnity and continued meditation. This earth is a place in which a much larger portion of a common Chri&s;tian's time mu&s;t be a&s;&s;igned to action than to contemplation. Women of the higher cla&s;s were not &s;ent into the world to &s;hun &s;ociety, but to improve it. They were not de&s;igned for the cold and vi&s;ionary virtues of &s;olitudes and mona&s;teries, but for the amiable, and endearing, and u&s;eful offices of &s;ocial life: they are of a religion which does not impo&s;e idle au&s;terities, but enjoins active duties; a religion of which the mo&s;t benevolent actions require to be &s;anctified by the pure&s;t motives; a religion which does not condemn its followers to the compa|ratively ea&s;y ta&s;k of &s;eclu&s;ion from the world, but
<PB N="166" REF="037996_0381_100FACEEE74EB6B0">
a&s;&s;igns them the more difficult province of living un|corrupted in it; a religion which, while it forbids them to "follow a multitude to do <HI>evil,</HI>" includes in that prohibition the &s;in of doing <HI>nothing,</HI> and which moreover enjoins them to be followers of him <Q>who went about doing <HI>good.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But may we not rea&s;onably contend, that though the &s;ame &s;eque&s;tration is not required, yet that the &s;ame <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and <HI>temper</HI> which one hopes is thought nece&s;&s;ary by all during the occa&s;ional humiliation, mu&s;t, by every real Chri&s;tian, be extended through|out all the periods of the year? And when that is really the ca&s;e, when once the &s;pirit of religion &s;hall indeed govern the heart, it will not only animate her religious actions and employments, but will gradually extend it&s;elf to the cha&s;ti&s;ing her conver&s;ation, will di&s;cipline her thoughts, influence her common bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and &s;anctify her very plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>But it &s;hould &s;eem that many, who entertain a <HI>general</HI> notion of Chri&s;tian duty, do not con&s;ider it as of univer&s;al and unremitting obligation, but rather as a duty binding at times on all, and always on &s;ome. To the attention of &s;uch we would recommend that very explicit addre&s;s of our Lord on the &s;ubject of &s;elf-denial, the temper directly oppo&s;ed to a worldly &s;pirit: <Q>And he &s;aid unto them ALL, if any man will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his cro&s;s DAILY.</Q> Tho&s;e who think &s;elf-denial
<PB N="167" REF="037996_0382_100FACF06DEA9F98">
not of <HI>univer&s;al</HI> obligation, will ob&s;erve the word <HI>all,</HI> and tho&s;e who think the obligation not <HI>con&s;tant</HI> will attend to the term <HI>daily.</HI> The&s;e two little words cut up by the root all the occa&s;ional religious ob&s;er|vances grafted on a worldly life; all tran&s;ient, pe|riodical, and temporary acts of piety, which &s;ome would commute for habitual thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>There is indeed &s;carcely a more pitiable being than one who, in&s;tead of making her religion the in|forming principle of all &s;he does, has only ju&s;t enough to keep her in continual fear; who drudges through her &s;tinted exerci&s;es with a &s;uper&s;titious kind of terror, while her general life &s;hows that the love of holine&s;s is not the governing principle in her heart: who &s;eems to &s;uffer all the pains and penalties of Chri&s;tianity, but is a &s;tranger to <Q>that liberty where|with Chri&s;t has made us free.</Q> Let it not be thought a ludicrous invention, if the author hazard the producing a real illu&s;tration of the&s;e remarks, in the in&s;tance of a lady of this &s;tamp, who, returning from church on a very cold day, and remarking with a good deal of &s;elf-complacency how much &s;he had &s;uffered in the performance of her duty, comforted her&s;elf with emphatically adding, <Q>that &s;he hoped however it would <HI>an&s;wer.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But there is no permanent comfort in any religion, &s;hort of that by which the diligent Chri&s;tian &s;trives that all his actions &s;hall have the love of God for
<PB N="168" REF="037996_0383_100FACF30F717DC0">
their motive, and the glory of God, as well as his own &s;alvation, for their end; while to go about to balance one's good and bad actions one again&s;t the other, and to take comfort in the occa&s;ional predomi|nance of the former, while the cultivation of the prin|ciple from which they &s;hould &s;pring is neglected, is not the road to all tho&s;e peaceful fruits of the &s;pirit to which true Chri&s;tianity conducts the humble and penitent believer.</P>
<P>But I am aware that a better ca&s;t of characters than tho&s;e we have been contemplating; that even the amiable and the well-di&s;po&s;ed, who, while they want courage to re&s;i&s;t what they have too much prin|ciple to think right, and too much &s;en&s;e to ju&s;tify, will yet plead for the <HI>palliating</HI> &s;y&s;tem, and accu&s;e the&s;e remarks of unnece&s;&s;ary rigour. They will de|clare <Q>that really they are as religious as they can be; they wi&s;h they were better; they have little &s;atisfaction in the life they are leading, yet they cannot break with the world; they cannot fly in the face of cu&s;tom; it does not become individuals like them to oppo&s;e the torrent of fa&s;hion.</Q> Beings &s;o intere&s;ting, abounding with engaging qualities; who not only feel the beauty of goodne&s;s, but rever|ence the truths of Chri&s;tianity, and are awfully look|ing for a general judgment, one is grieved to hear lament "that they only do as others do," when they are perhaps them&s;elves of &s;uch rank and importance
<PB N="169" REF="037996_0384_100FACF5B88F8DA0">
that if they would begin to do right, others would be brought to do as they did.

Be&s;ides, this diffidence does not break out on other occa&s;ions. They do not blu&s;h to be quoted as the oppo&s;ers of an old mode or the inventors of a new one. Nor are they equally backward in being the fir&s;t to appear in a &s;trange fa&s;hion, &s;uch an one as often excites wonder, and &s;ometimes even offends again&s;t delicacy. Let not then diffidence be pleaded as an excu&s;e only on occa&s;ions wherein courage would be virtue.</P>
<P>Will it be thought too har&s;h a que&s;tion if we ven|ture to a&s;k the&s;e gentle characters who are thus in|trenching them&s;elves in the imaginary &s;afety of &s;ur|rounding multitudes, and who &s;ay <Q>we only do as others do,</Q> whether they are willing to run the tremendous ri&s;k of con&s;equences, and <HI>to fare as others fare?.</HI></P>

But while the&s;e plead the authority of Fa&s;hion as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for their conformity to the world, one who has &s;poken with a paramount authority has po&s;itively &s;aid, "Be ye <HI>not</HI> conformed to the world."

<P>Temptation to conform to the world was never perhaps more irre&s;i&s;tible than in the days which immediately preceded the Deluge. And no man could ever have pleaded the <HI>fa&s;hion</HI> in order to ju&s;ti|fy a criminal a&s;&s;imilation with the reigning manners, with more propriety than the Patriarch Noah. He had the two grand and contending objects of terror to encounter which we have; the fear of ridicule, and the fear of de&s;truction; the dread of &s;in, and the dread of &s;ingularity. Our cau&s;e of alarm is at lea&s;t equally pre&s;&s;ing with his; for it does not ap|pear, even while he was actually obeying the Divine command in providing the means of his future &s;afe|ty, that he <HI>&s;aw</HI> any actual &s;ymptoms of the impend|ing ruin. So that in one &s;en&s;e <HI>he</HI> might have truly pleaded as an excu&s;e for &s;lackne&s;s of preparation, "that all things continued as they were from the beginning;" while many of us, though the &s;torm is begun, never think of providing the refuge&punc; though we have had a fuller revelation, have &s;een

Scripture illu&s;trated, prophecy fulfilling, with every awful circum&s;tance that can either quicken the mo&s;t &s;luggi&s;h remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, or confirm the feeble&s;t faith.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Patriarch's plea for following the fa&s;hion was &s;tronger than you can produce. While you mu&s;t &s;ee that many are going wrong, he &s;aw that none were going right. <Q>All fle&s;h had corrupt|ed his way before God;</Q> whil&s;t, ble&s;&s;ed be God! you have &s;till in&s;tances enough of piety to keep you in countenance. While you lament that <HI>the world</HI> &s;educes you, (for every one has a little world of his own,) your world perhaps is only a petty neighbour|hood, a few &s;treets and &s;quares; but the Patriarch had really the contagion of a whole united world to re&s;i&s;t; he had literally the example of the whole face of the earth to oppo&s;e. The "fear of man" al&s;o would then have been a more pardonable fault, when the lives of the &s;ame individuals who were likely to excite re&s;pect or fear was prolonged many ages, than it can be in the &s;hort period now a&s;&s;igned to human life.

<P>A wi&s;e man will never differ from the world in trifles.

It has been before hinted, that Religion &s;hould be taught at an early period of life; that children &s;hould be <HI>brought up</HI> <Q>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</Q> The <HI>manner</HI> in which they &s;hould be taught has likewi&s;e with great plainne&s;s been &s;ugge&s;ted; that it &s;hould be done in &s;o lively and familiar a manner as to make Religion amiable, and her ways to appear, what they really are, <Q>ways of plea&s;antne&s;s.</Q> And a &s;light &s;ketch has been given of the genius of Chri&s;tianity, by which her amiable|ne&s;s would more clearly appear.

<HEAD>ON THE DOCTRINE OF HUMAN CORRUPTION.</HEAD>
<P>To come now to a more particular &s;tatement of the&s;e doctrines.&mdash;When an important edifice is about to be erected, a wi&s;e builder will dig deep, and look well to the foundations, knowing that without this the fabric will not be likely to &s;tand. The founda|tion of the Chri&s;tian religion, out of which the whole &s;tructure may be &s;aid to ari&s;e, appears to be the doc|trine of the fall of man from his original &s;tate of righteou&s;ne&s;s; and of the corruption and helple&s;&s;ne&s;s of human nature, which are the con&s;equences of this fall, and which is the natural &s;tate of every one born into the world. To this doctrine it is important to conciliate the minds, more e&s;pecially of young per|&s;ons, who are peculiarly di&s;po&s;ed to turn away from it as a moro&s;e, unamiable, and gloomy idea: they are apt to accu&s;e tho&s;e who are more &s;trict and &s;e|rious, of unnece&s;&s;ary &s;everity, and to &s;u&s;pect them of thinking unju&s;tly ill of mankind. Some of the rea&s;ons which prejudice the inexperienced again&s;t the doctrine in que&s;tion appear to be the following.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="037996_0394_100FAD0F5B2B4AB0">
Young per&s;ons them&s;elves have &s;een little of the world. In plea&s;urable &s;ociety the world puts on its mo&s;t amiable appearance; and that &s;oftne&s;s and ur|banity which prevail, particularly among&s;t per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, are liable to be mi&s;taken for more than they are really worth. The oppo&s;ition to this doc|trine in the young, ari&s;es partly from ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of heart, partly from a habit of indulging them&s;elves in favourable &s;uppo&s;itions re&s;pecting the world, rather than of pur&s;uing truth, which is always the grand thing to be pur&s;ued; and partly from the popularity of the tenet, <HI>that every body is &s;o wonderfully good!</HI></P>
<P>This error in youth has however a &s;till deeper foundation, which is their not having a right &s;tand|ard of moral good and evil, in con&s;equence of their already partaking of the very corruption which is &s;poken of; they are therefore apt to have no very &s;trict &s;en&s;e of duty, or of the nece&s;&s;ity of a right and religious motive to every act.</P>
<P>Moreover, young people u&s;ually do not know them&s;elves.

<P>Having laid down the&s;e as &s;ome of the cau&s;es of error on this point, I proceed to ob&s;erve on what &s;trong grounds the doctrine it&s;elf &s;tands.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="037996_0395_100FAD11F52681A0">
Profane hi&s;tory abundantly confirms this truth: the hi&s;tory of the world being in fact little el&s;e than the hi&s;tory of the crimes of the human race. Even though the annals of remote ages lie &s;o involved in ob&s;curity, that &s;ome degree of uncertainty attaches it&s;elf to many of the events recorded, yet this one melancholy truth is always clear, that mo&s;t of the mi&s;eries which have been brought upon mankind, have proceeded from this general depravity.</P>
<P>The world we now live in furni&s;hes abundant proof of this truth. In a world formed on the deceitful theory of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert the innocence and dignity of man, almo&s;t all the profe&s;&s;ions, &s;ince they would have been rendered u&s;ele&s;s by &s;uch a &s;tate of inno|cence, would not have exi&s;ted. Without &s;in we may nearly pre&s;ume there would have been no &s;ickne&s;s; &s;o that every medical profe&s;&s;or is a &s;tanding evidence of this &s;ad truth. Sin not only brought &s;ickne&s;s but death into the world; con&s;equently every funeral pre|&s;ents a more irrefragable argument than a thou&s;and &s;ermons. Had man per&s;evered in his original inte|grity, there could have been no litigation, for there would be no conte&s;ts about property in a world where none would be inclined to attack it. Profe&s;&s;ors of law, therefore, from the attorney who pro&s;ecutes for a tre&s;pa&s;s, to the pleader who defends a criminal, or the judge who condemns him, loudly confirm the doctrine. Every victory by &s;ea or land &s;hould teach

us to rejoice with humiliation, for conque&s;t it&s;elf brings a terrible, though &s;plendid atte&s;tation to the truth of the fall of man.</P>
<P>Even tho&s;e who deny the doctrine, act univer&s;ally more or le&s;s on the principle. Why do we all &s;ecure our hou&s;es with bolts, and bars, and locks? Do we take the&s;e &s;teps to defend our lives or property from any <HI>particular</HI> fear? from any &s;u&s;picion of this neigh|bour, or that &s;ervant, or the other invader? No:&mdash;It is from a practical conviction of the common de|pravity; from a con&s;tant, pervading, but undefined dread of impending evil ari&s;ing from the &s;en&s;e of ge|neral corruption. Are not pri&s;ons built, and laws enacted, on the &s;ame practical principle?</P>
<P>But not to de&s;cend to the more degraded part of our &s;pecies. Why in the faire&s;t tran&s;action of bu&s;i|ne&s;s is nothing executed without bonds, receipts, and notes of hand? Why does not a perfect confi|dence in the <HI>dignity of human nature</HI> aboli&s;h all the&s;e &s;ecurities; if not between enemies, or people indif|ferent to each other, yet at lea&s;t between friends and kindred, and the mo&s;t honourable connections? Why, but becau&s;e of that univer&s;al &s;u&s;picion between man and man, which, by all we &s;ee, and hear, and feel, is become interwoven with our very make? Though we do not entertain any <HI>individual</HI> &s;u&s;picion, nay, though we have the &s;tronge&s;t <HI>per&s;onal</HI> confidence, yet the acknowledged principle of conduct has this doc|trine

<P>But the grand arguments for this doctrine mu&s;t be drawn from the Holy Scriptures: and the&s;e, be&s;ides implying it almo&s;t continually, expre&s;sly a&s;&s;ert it; and that in in&s;tances too numerous to be all of them brought forward here.

<P>Nor do the Scriptures &s;peak of this corruption as ari&s;ing only from occa&s;ional temptation, or from mere extrin&s;ic cau&s;es. The wi&s;e man tells us, that <Q>fool|i&s;hne&s;s is bound up in the <HI>heart of a child:</HI></Q> the prophet Jeremiah a&s;&s;ures us, <Q>the <HI>heart</HI> is deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked:</Q> and David plainly &s;tates the doctrine: <Q>Behold, I was &s;hapen in iniquity, and in &s;in did my mother con|ceive me.</Q> Can language be more explicit?</P>
<P>The New Te&s;tament corroborates the Old. Our Lord's reproof of Peter &s;eems to take the doctrine for

<P>Here, however, if it be objected, that the heathen who never heard of the Go&s;pel will not a&s;&s;uredly be judged by it; the Saviour's an&s;wer to &s;uch curious inquirers concerning the &s;tate of others is, <Q>Strive to enter in at the &s;trait gate.</Q> It is enough for us
<PB N="185" REF="037996_0400_100FAD1E53C9CFA8">
to believe that God will judge all men according to their opportunities. But with whatever mercy he may judge tho&s;e who, living in a land of darkne&s;s, are without knowledge of his revealed law, <HI>our</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s is not with them, but with our&s;elves.

It may be further ob&s;erved that the
<PB N="186" REF="037996_0401_100FAD20F86FC4E8">
&s;ame Apo&s;tle, writing to the churches of Galatia, tells them, that the natural corruption of the human heart is continually oppo&s;ing the &s;pirit of holine&s;s which influences the regenerate. <Q>The fle&s;h lu&s;teth again&s;t the &s;pirit, and the &s;pirit again&s;t the fle&s;h, and the&s;e are contrary the one to the other:</Q> which pa&s;&s;age by the way, at the &s;ame time that it proves the corruption of the heart, proves the nece&s;&s;ity of divine influences. And the Apo&s;tle, with re&s;pect to him&s;elf, freely confe&s;&s;es and deeply laments the work|ings of this corrupt principle: <Q>O wretched man that I am!</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It has been objected by &s;ome who have oppo&s;ed this doctrine, that the &s;ame Scriptures which &s;peak of mankind as being <HI>&s;inners,</HI> &s;peak of &s;ome as being <HI>righteous;</HI> and hence they would argue, that though this depravity of human nature may be <HI>general,</HI> yet it cannot be <HI>univer&s;al.</HI> This objection when, examin|ed, &s;erves only, like all other objections again&s;t the truth, to e&s;tabli&s;h that which it was intended to de|&s;troy. For what do the Scriptures a&s;&s;ert re&s;pecting the righteous? That there are &s;ome who&s;e principles, views, and conduct, are &s;o different from the re&s;t of the world, and from what theirs them&s;elves once were, that the&s;e per&s;ons are honoured with the pe|culiar title of the "&s;ons of God." But no where do the Scriptures a&s;&s;ert that even the&s;e are <HI>&s;inle&s;s;</HI> on the contrary their <HI>faults</HI> are frequently mentioned;
<PB N="187" REF="037996_0402_100FAD24AB014AE8">
and per&s;ons of this cla&s;s are moreover repre&s;ented as tho&s;e on whom a great <HI>change</HI> has pa&s;t: as having been formerly "dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins;" but as "being now <HI>called out</HI> of darkne&s;s into light;" as "<HI>tran&s;lated</HI> into the kingdom of God's dear Son;" as "having <HI>pa&s;&s;ed</HI> from death to life." And St. Paul put this matter pa&s;t all doubt, by expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erting, that <Q><HI>they were all</HI> by nature the children of wrath even as others.</Q></P>
<P>It might be well to a&s;k certain per&s;ons who op|po&s;e the doctrine in que&s;tion, and who al&s;o &s;eem to talk as if they thought there were many &s;inle&s;s peo|ple in the world, how they expect that &s;uch &s;inle&s;s people will be &s;aved? (though indeed to talk of an <HI>innocent</HI> per&s;on being <HI>&s;aved</HI> is a palpable contradiction in terms; it is talking of curing a man already in health.) "Undoubtedly," &s;uch will &s;ay, <Q>they will be received into tho&s;e abodes of bli&s;s prepared for the righteous.</Q>&mdash;But be it remembered, there is but <HI>one way</HI> to the&s;e bli&s;sful abodes, and that is, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t: <Q>For there is none other name given among men whereby we mu&s;t be &s;av|ed.</Q> If we a&s;k whom did Chri&s;t come to &s;ave? the Scripture directly an&s;wers, <Q>He came into the world to &s;ave <HI>&s;inners:</HI></Q>&mdash;<Q>His name was called Je&s;us, becau&s;e he came to &s;ave his people <HI>from their &s;ins.</HI></Q> When St. John was favoured with a heavenly vi&s;ion, he tells us, that he beheld <Q>a great multitude
<PB N="188" REF="037996_0403_100FAD2632B4B298">
which no man could number, of all nations, and kindred, and people, and tongues, &s;tanding be|fore the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes:</Q> that one of the heavenly in|habitants informed him who they were: <Q>The&s;e are they who come out of great tribulation, and have wa&s;hed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb; therefore are they before the throne of God, and &s;erve Him day and night in his Temple; and He that &s;itteth on the throne &s;hall dwell among them; they &s;hall hunger no more, neither thir&s;t any more, neither &s;hall the &s;un light on them, nor any heat; for the Lamb which is in the mid&s;t of them &s;hall feed them, and &s;hall lead them to living fountains of waters, and God &s;hall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</Q></P>
<P>We may gather from this de&s;cription what the&s;e glorious and happy beings once were: they were <HI>&s;inful</HI> creatures: their robes were not <HI>&s;potle&s;s:</HI> <Q>They had <HI>wa&s;hed</HI> them, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</Q> They are likewi&s;e generally repre&s;ented as having been once a <HI>&s;uffering</HI> people: they came out of great tribulation. They are de|&s;cribed as having overcome the great tempter of man|kind, "by the blood of the Lamb*:" as they who
<PB N="189" REF="037996_0404_100FAD290C328730">
"follow the Lamb where&s;oever he goeth:" as <Q>re|deemed from among men.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xiv. 4.</NOTE> And their <HI>employ|ment</HI> in the regions of bli&s;s is a farther confirmation of the doctrine of which we are treating. <Q>The great multitude,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c. we are told, <Q>&s;tood and cried with a loud voice, Salvation to our God, who &s;itteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb!</Q> Here we &s;ee they a&s;cribe their &s;alvation to Chri&s;t, and con&s;equently their pre&s;ent happine&s;s to his atoning blood. And in another of their cele&s;tial anthems, they &s;ay in like manner: <Q>Thou wa&s;t &s;lain, and ha&s;t redeemed us to God by Thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. v. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>By all this it is evident, that men of any other de&s;cription than <HI>redeemed &s;inners</HI> mu&s;t gain admittance to heaven &s;ome other way than that which the Scriptures point out; and al&s;o that when they &s;hall arrive there, &s;o different will be their employment, that they mu&s;t have an anthem peculiar to them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Nothing is more adapted to <Q>the ca&s;ting down of high imaginations,</Q> and to promote humility, than this reflection, that heaven is always in Scrip|ture pointed out not as the reward of the innocent,
<PB N="190" REF="037996_0405_100F7C73825847E0">
but as the hope of the penitent. This, while it is calculated to "exclude boa&s;ting," the temper the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the Go&s;pel, is yet the mo&s;t &s;uited to afford comfort; for were heaven promi&s;ed as the reward of innocence, who could attain to it? but being, as it is, the promi&s;ed portion of faith and repentance, who is compelled to mi&s;s it?</P>
<P>It is urged that the belief of this doctrine of our corruption produces many ill effects, and therefore it &s;hould be di&s;couraged.&mdash;That it does <HI>not</HI> produce tho&s;e ill effects, when not mi&s;under&s;tood or partially repre&s;ented, we &s;hall attempt to &s;how: at the &s;ame time let it be ob&s;erved, if it be really <HI>true</HI> we mu&s;t not reject it on account of any of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed ill con&s;equences. Truth may often be attended with di&s;agreeable effects, but if it be truth it mu&s;t &s;till be pur&s;ued.

<P>It is objected, that this doctrine deba&s;es human na|ture, and that finding fault with the building is only another way of finding fault with the architect. To the fir&s;t part of this objection it may be remarked, that if man be really a corrupt, fallen being, it is proper to repre&s;ent him as &s;uch: the fault then lies
<PB N="191" REF="037996_0406_100FAD2FA16554E8">
in the <HI>man,</HI> and not in the <HI>doctrine,</HI> which only &s;tates the <HI>truth.</HI> As to the inference which is &s;uppo&s;ed to follow, namely, that it throws the fault upon the Creator, it proceeds upon the fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;ition that man's pre&s;ent corrupt &s;tate is the &s;tate in which he was originally created: and al&s;o that God has left him unavoidably to peri&s;h in it, whereas although "in Adam we die, in Chri&s;t we &s;hall be made alive."</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e objected, that as this doctrine mu&s;t give us &s;uch a bad opinion of mankind, it mu&s;t con|&s;equently produce ill-will, hatred, and &s;u&s;picion. But it &s;hould be remembered, that it gives us no wor&s;e an opinion of other men than it gives us of our&s;elves; &s;uch views of our&s;elves have a very &s;alu|tary effect, ina&s;much as they have a tendency to pro|duce <HI>humility;</HI> and humility is not likely to produce ill-will to others, <Q>for only from pride cometh con|tention:</Q> and as to the views it gives us of man|kind, it repre&s;ents us as <HI>follow &s;ufferers;</HI> and &s;urely the con&s;ideration that we are <HI>companions in mi&s;ery</HI> is not calculated to produce hatred. The truth is, the&s;e effects have actually followed from a fal&s;e and partial view of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Old per&s;ons who have &s;een much of the world, and who have little religion, are apt to be &s;trong in their belief of man's actual corruption; but not tak|ing it up on Chri&s;tian grounds, this belief in them

&s;hows it&s;elf in a narrow and malignant temper; in uncharitable judgment, and har&s;h opinions.</P>
<P>Su&s;picion and hatred al&s;o are the u&s;es to which Rochefaucault and the other French philo&s;ophers have converted this doctrine: their acute minds in|tuitively found the corruption of man, and they &s;aw it without its concomitant and correcting doctrine: they allowed man to be a depraved creature, but di&s;|allowed his high original: they found him in a low &s;tate, but did not conceive of him as having fallen from a better. They repre&s;ent him rather as a brute than an apo&s;tate; not taking into the account that his pre&s;ent degraded nature and depraved faculties are not his original &s;tate: that he is not &s;uch as he came out of the hands of his Creator, but &s;uch as he has been made by &s;in. Nor do they know that he has not even now lo&s;t all remains of his primitive dignity, but is &s;till capable of a re&s;toration more glorious
<Q><L>Than is dreamt of in their philo&s;ophy.</L></Q>
Perhaps, too, they know from what they <HI>feel,</HI> all the <HI>evil</HI> to which man is inclined; but they do not know, for they have not felt, all the good of which he is capable by the &s;uperinduction of the divine principle: thus they a&s;per&s;e human nature in&s;tead of repre&s;enting it fairly, and in &s;o doing it is <HI>they</HI> who calumniate the great Creator.</P>

The doctrine of corruption is likewi&s;e accu&s;ed of being a gloomy, di&s;couraging doctrine, and an enemy to joy and comfort. Now &s;uppo&s;e this objection true in its fulle&s;t extent.

<P>But this charge is <HI>not</HI> true in the &s;en&s;e intended by tho&s;e who bring it forward. Tho&s;e who believe this doctrine are <HI>not</HI> the mo&s;t gloomy people.

<P>Of this doctrine it is of the la&s;t importance to form ju&s;t views, for as it is the only doctrine which can keep the humble penitent from de&s;pair, &s;o, on the other hand, great care mu&s;t be taken that fal&s;e views of it do not lead us to pre&s;umption.

By all which ex|pre&s;&s;ions, and many others of like import, we are taught that, while we are to a&s;cribe with humble gratitude every good thought, word, and work, to the influence of the Holy Spirit, we are not to look on &s;uch influences as &s;uper&s;eding our own exertions: and it is plain that we <HI>may</HI> reject the gracious offers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;ince otherwi&s;e there would be no occa|&s;ion to caution us <HI>not</HI> to do it. The Scriptures have illu&s;trated this in terms which are familiar indeed, but which are therefore only the more conde&s;cending, and endearing. <Q>Behold, I &s;tand at the door and knock.

<P>This &s;ublime doctrine of divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance is the more to be prized, not only on account of our own helple&s;&s;ne&s;s, but from the additional con&s;ideration of the powerful adver&s;ary with whom the Chri&s;tian has to contend: an article of our faith by the way, which is growing into general di&s;repute among the politer cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety. Nay, there is a kind of ridicule attached to the very &s;ugge&s;tion of the &s;ubject, as if it were exploded on full proof of its being an ab&s;olute ab&s;urdity, utterly repugnant to the liberal &s;pirit of an enlightened age. And it requires no &s;mall neatne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion and periphra&s;tic ingenuity to get the very mention tolerated.&mdash;<HI>I mean the Scripture doctrine of the exi&s;tence and power of our great &s;piritual enemy.</HI> It is con&s;idered by the fa&s;hionable &s;ceptic as a vulgar invention, which ought to be bani&s;hed with the belief in dreams, and gho&s;ts, and witchcraft:&mdash;by the fa&s;hionable Chri&s;tian, as an ingenious allegory, but not as a literal truth; and by almo&s;t all, as a doctrine which, when it happens to be introduced at Church, has at lea&s;t nothing to do with the <HI>pews,</HI> but is by common con&s;ent made over to the <HI>ai&s;les,</HI> if indeed it mu&s;t be retained at all.</P>
<P>May I, with great humility and re&s;pect, pre&s;ume to &s;ugge&s;t to our divines that they would do well not

to lend their countenance to the&s;e modi&s;h curtailments of the Chri&s;tian faith; nor to &s;hun the introduction of this doctrine when it con&s;i&s;ts with their &s;ubject to bring it forward. A truth which is &s;eldom brought before the eye, imperceptibly grows le&s;s and le&s;s im|portant; and if it be an unplea&s;ing truth, we grow more and more reconciled to its ab&s;ence, till at length its intru&s;ion becomes offen&s;ive, and we learn in the end to renounce what we at fir&s;t only neglected. Be|cau&s;e &s;ome coar&s;e and ranting enthu&s;ia&s;ts have been fond of u&s;ing tremendous terms with a violence and frequency, which might make it &s;eem to be a gratifi|cation to them to denounce judgments and anticipate torments, can <HI>their</HI> coar&s;ene&s;s or vulgarity make a true doctrine fal&s;e, or an important one trifling? If &s;uch preachers have given offence by their uncouth man|ner of managing an awful doctrine, that indeed fur|ni&s;hes a caution to treat the &s;ubject more di&s;creetly, but it is no ju&s;t rea&s;on for avoiding the doctrine. For to keep a truth out of &s;ight becau&s;e it has been ab&s;urdly handled or ill-defended, might in time be a&s;&s;igned as a rea&s;on for keeping back, one by one, every doctrine of our holy Church; for which of them has not had imprudent advocates or weak champions?</P>
<P>Be it remembered that the doctrine in que&s;tion is not only interwoven by allu&s;ion, implication, or di|rect a&s;&s;ertion throughout the whole Scripture, but
<PB N="203" REF="037996_0418_100FAD4E43B2DA88">
that it &s;tands prominently per&s;onified at the opening of the New as well as the Old Te&s;tament. The de|vil's temptation of our Lord, in which he is not re|pre&s;ented figuratively, but vi&s;ibly and palpably, &s;tands on the &s;ame ground of authority with other events which are received without repugnance. And it may not be an unu&s;eful ob&s;ervation to remark, that the very refu&s;ing to believe in an evil &s;pirit, may be con&s;idered as one of his own &s;ugge&s;tions; for there is not a more dangerous illu&s;ion than to believe our|&s;elves out of the reach of illu&s;ions, nor a more alarm|ing temptation than to fancy that we are not liable to be tempted.</P>
<P>But the dark cloud rai&s;ed by this doctrine will be di&s;pelled by the cheering certainty that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour having him&s;elf <Q>been tempted like as we are, is able to deliver tho&s;e who are tempted.</Q></P>

We may likewi&s;e &s;ee how much the character of a true Chri&s;tian ri&s;es above every other: that there is a wholene&s;s, an integrity, a completene&s;s in the Chri&s;|tian character: that a few natural, plea&s;ing qualities, not ca&s;t in the mould of the Go&s;pel, are but as beau|tiful fragments, or well-turned &s;ingle limbs, which for want of that beauty which ari&s;es from the pro|portion of parts, for want of that connection of the members with the living head, are of little compara|tive excellence. There may be amiable qualities which are not Chri&s;tian graces: and the Apo&s;tle, af|ter enumerating every &s;eparate article of attack or de|fence with which a Chri&s;tian warrior is to be accou|tred, &s;ums up the matter by directing that we put on "the <HI>whole</HI> armour of God." And this <HI>completene&s;s</HI> is in&s;i&s;ted on by all the Apo&s;tles.

<P>Now we are not to &s;uppo&s;e that they expected any convert to be <HI>without faults;</HI> they knew too well the con&s;titution of the human heart; but Chri&s;tians mu&s;t have no fault in their <HI>principle;</HI> their views mu&s;t be direct, their propo&s;ed <HI>&s;cheme</HI> mu&s;t be fault|le&s;s; their <HI>intention</HI> mu&s;t be &s;ingle; their <HI>&s;tandard</HI> mu&s;t be lofty; their <HI>object</HI> mu&s;t be right; their <Q><HI>mark</HI> mu&s;t be the high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q>&mdash;There mu&s;t be no <HI>allowed</HI> evil, no <HI>war|ranted</HI>

<P>For in&s;tance; Chri&s;tianity requires that our faith be at once fervent and &s;ober; that our love be both ardent and la&s;ting; that our patience be not only he|roic but gentle: &s;he demands dauntle&s;s zeal and ge|nuine humility; active &s;ervices and complete &s;elf-renunciation; high attainments in goodne&s;s, with deep con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of defect; courage in reproving, and meekne&s;s in bearing reproof; a quick perception of what is &s;inful; with a willingne&s;s to forgive the offender; active virtue ready to <HI>do</HI> all, and pa&s;&s;ive virtue ready to <HI>bear</HI> all.&mdash;We mu&s;t &s;tretch every fa|culty in the &s;ervice of our Lord, and yet bring every thought into obedience to Him: while we aim to live in the exerci&s;e of every Chri&s;tian grace, we mu&s;t account our&s;elves unprofitable &s;ervants: we mu&s;t

&s;eparate and di&s;connected &s;et of opinions, rather than as an influential principle of action.&mdash;In violation of that beautiful harmony which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in every part of Scripture between practice and belief, the religi|ous world furni&s;hes two &s;orts of people, who &s;eem to enli&s;t them&s;elves, as if in oppo&s;ition, under the ban|ners of Saint Paul and Saint James, as if tho&s;e two great champions of the Chri&s;tian cau&s;e had fought for two ma&s;ters.

<P>Now in&s;tead of rea&s;oning on the point, let us refer to the Apo&s;tle in que&s;tion, who definitively &s;et|tles the di&s;pute. The Apo&s;tolical order and method in this re&s;pect de&s;erve notice and imitation; for it is ob&s;ervable that the earlier parts of mo&s;t of the Epi&s;|tles abound in the <HI>doctrines</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, while tho&s;e latter chapters, which wind up the &s;ubject, ex|hibit all the <HI>duties</HI> which grow out of them, as the natural and nece&s;&s;ary productions of &s;uch a living root. But this alternate mention of doctrine and practice, which &s;eemed likely to <HI>unite,</HI> has on the contrary formed a &s;ort of line of &s;eparation between the&s;e two orders of believers, and introduced a bro|ken and mutilated &s;y&s;tem. Tho&s;e who would make Chri&s;tianity con&s;i&s;t of doctrines only, dwell, for in|&s;tance, on the fir&s;t eleven chapters of the Epi&s;tle to
<PB N="208" REF="037996_0423_100FAD5C2FDF18B0">
the Romans, as containing exclu&s;ively the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of the Go&s;pel. While the mere morali&s;ts, who wi&s;h to &s;trip Chri&s;tianity of her lofty and ap|propriate attributes, delight to dwell on the <HI>twelfth</HI> chapter, which is a table of duties, as exclu&s;ively as if the preceding chapters made no part of the &s;acred Canon. But Paul him&s;elf, who was at lea&s;t as &s;ound a theologian as any of his commentators, &s;ettles the matter another way, by making the duties of the twelfth grow out of the doctrines of the antecedent <HI>eleven,</HI> ju&s;t as any other con&s;equence grows out of its cau&s;e. And as if he &s;u&s;pected that the indivi&s;ible union between them might po&s;&s;ibly be overlooked, he links the two di&s;tinct divi&s;ions together by a logical "therefore," with which the twelfth begins:&mdash;"I be&s;eech you <HI>therefore,</HI>" (that is, as the effect of all I have been inculcating,) <Q>that you pre&s;ent your bo|dies a living &s;acrifice, acceptable to God,</Q> &amp;c. and then goes on to enforce on them, as a con&s;equence of what he had been preaching, the practice of every Chri&s;tian virtue. This combined view of the &s;ubject &s;eems, on the one hand, to be the only means of pre|venting the &s;ub&s;titution of Pagan morality for Chri&s;|tian holine&s;s; and on the other, of &s;ecuring the lead|ing doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith, from the dread|ful danger of Antinomian licentiou&s;ne&s;s; every hu|man obligation being thus grafted on the living &s;tock of a divine principle.</P>

<P>There is a cla&s;s of objectors who &s;trangely profe&s;s to withhold homage from the Mo&s;t High, not out of contempt, but reverence. They affect to con|&s;ider the u&s;e of prayer as derogatory to the omni&s;ci|ence of God, a&s;&s;erting that it looks as if we thought he &s;tood in need of being informed of our wants; and as derogatory to his goodne&s;s, as implying that he needs to be put in mind of them.</P>
<P>But is it not enough for &s;uch poor frail beings as we are to know, that God him&s;elf does not con&s;ider prayer as derogatory either to his wi&s;dom or good|ne&s;s? And &s;hall <HI>we</HI> erect our&s;elves into judges of
<PB N="210" REF="037996_0425_100FAD6187355640">
what is con&s;i&s;tent with the attributes of HIM before whom angels fall pro&s;trate with &s;elf-aba&s;ement? Will he thank &s;uch defenders of his attributes, who, while they profe&s;s to reverence, &s;cruple not to di&s;obey him? It ought rather to be viewed as a great encou|ragement to prayer, that we are addre&s;&s;ing a Being, who knows our wants better than we can expre&s;s them, and who&s;e preventing goodne&s;s is always rea|dy to relieve them.</P>
<P>It is objected by another cla&s;s, and on the &s;peci|ous ground of humility too, though we do not al|ways find the objector him&s;elf quite as humble as his plea, that it is arrogant in &s;uch in&s;ignificant beings as we are to pre&s;ume to lay our petty nece&s;&s;ities be|fore the Great and Glorious God, who cannot be expected to conde&s;cend to the multitude of trifling and even interfering reque&s;ts which are brought be|fore him by his creatures. The&s;e and &s;uch like ob|jections ari&s;e from mean and unworthy thoughts of the Great Creator. It &s;eems as if tho&s;e who make them con&s;idered the Mo&s;t High as <Q>&s;uch an one as them&s;elves;</Q> a Being, who can perform a certain quantity of bu&s;ine&s;s, but who would be overpower|ed with an additional quantity. Or at be&s;t, is it not con&s;idering the Almighty in the light, not of an in|finite God, but of a great man, of a mini&s;ter, of a king, who, while he &s;uperintends great and national concerns, is obliged to neglect &s;mall and individual
<PB N="211" REF="037996_0426_100FAD655DA4C690">
petitions, becau&s;e he cannot &s;pare that lei&s;ure and at|tention which &s;uffice for every thing? They do not con&s;ider him as that infinitely glorious Being who, while he beholds at once all that is doing in heaven and in earth, is at the &s;ame time as attentive to the prayer of the poor de&s;titute, as pre&s;ent to the &s;orrow|ful &s;ighing of the pri&s;oner, as if the&s;e forlorn crea|tures were the objects of his undivided attention.</P>
<P>The&s;e critics, who are for &s;paring the Supreme Being the trouble of our prayers, and, if I may &s;o &s;peak without profanene&s;s, would relieve Omnipo|tence of part of his burden, by a&s;&s;igning to his care only &s;uch a portion as may be more ea&s;ily managed, &s;eem to have no conception of his attributes.</P>
<P>They forget that infinite wi&s;dom puts him as ea&s;ily within reach of all knowledge, as infinite power does of all performance: that he is a Being in who&s;e plans complexity makes no difficulty, and multiplicity no confu&s;ion: that to ubiquity di&s;tance does not exi&s;t; that to infinity &s;pace is annihilated; that pa&s;t, pre|&s;ent, and future, are di&s;cerned more accurately at one glance of his eye, to whom a thou&s;and years are as one day, than a &s;ingle moment of time or a &s;ingle point of &s;pace can be by ours.</P>
<P>To the other part of the objection founded on the &s;uppo&s;ed interference (that is, irreconcilablene&s;s) of one man's petitions with tho&s;e of another, this an|&s;wer
<PB N="212" REF="037996_0427_100FAD66E5DFCD00">
&s;eems to &s;ugge&s;t it&s;elf: fir&s;t, that we mu&s;t take care that when we a&s;k, we do not "a&s;k ami&s;s;" that, for in&s;tance, we a&s;k chiefly, and in an un|qualified manner, only for &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings to our|&s;elves and others; and in doing this the prayer of one man <HI>cannot</HI> interfere with that of another. Next, in a&s;king for temporal and inferior ble&s;&s;ings, we mu&s;t <HI>qualify</HI> our petition even though it &s;hould extend to deliverance from the &s;evere&s;t pains, or to our very life it&s;elf, according to that example of our Saviour: <Q>Father, <HI>if it be po&s;&s;ible,</HI> let this cup pa&s;s from me. <HI>Neverthele&s;s, not my will,</HI> but thine, be done.</Q> By thus qualifying our prayer, we exerci&s;e our&s;elves in an act of re&s;ignation to God; we profe&s;s not to wi&s;h what will interfere with his benevolent plan, and yet we may hope by prayer to &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;|ing &s;o far as it is con&s;i&s;tent with it. Perhaps the rea&s;on why this objection to prayer is &s;o &s;trongly felt, is the too great di&s;po&s;ition to pray for merely temporal and worldly ble&s;&s;ings, and to de&s;ire them in the mo&s;t unqualified manner, not &s;ubmitting to be without them, even though the granting them &s;hould be incon&s;i&s;tent with the general plan of Pro|vidence.</P>
<P>Another cla&s;s continue to bring forward, as per|tinaciou&s;ly as if it had never been an&s;wered, the ex|hau&s;ted argument, that &s;eeing God is immutable, no petitions of ours can ever change Him: that events

them&s;elves being &s;ettled in a fixed and unalterable cour&s;e, and bound in a fatal nece&s;&s;ity, it is folly to think that we can di&s;turb the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of the univer&s;e, or interrupt the cour&s;e of Providence by our prayers: and that it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e firm decrees can be rever&s;ed by any reque&s;ts of ours.</P>
<P>Without entering into the wide and trackle&s;s field of fate and free will, from which pur&s;uit I am kept back equally by the mo&s;t profound ignorance and the mo&s;t invincible di&s;like, I would only ob&s;erve, that the&s;e objections apply equally to all human acti|ons as well as to prayer. It may therefore with the &s;ame propriety be urged, that &s;eeing God is immu|table and his decrees unalterable, therefore our <HI>ac|tions</HI> can produce no change in Him or in our own &s;tate. Weak as well as impious rea&s;oning. It may be que&s;tioned whether the modern French and German philo&s;ophers might not be prevailed upon to acknowledge the exi&s;tence of God, if they might make &s;uch an u&s;e of his attributes. The truth is, and it is a truth di&s;coverable without any depth of learning, all the&s;e objections are the offspring of <HI>pride.</HI> Poor, &s;hort-&s;ighted man cannot reconcile the omni&s;cience and decrees of God with the efficacy of prayer; and, becau&s;e <HI>he</HI> cannot reconcile them, he mode&s;tly concludes they are irreconcilable. How much more wi&s;dom as well as happine&s;s re&s;ults from an humble chri&s;tian &s;pirit! Such a plain practi|cal

text as, <Q>Draw near unto God, and he will draw near unto you,</Q> carries more con&s;olation, more true knowledge of his wants and their remedy to the heart of a penitent &s;inner, than all the <HI>tomes</HI> of ca&s;ui&s;try which have puzzled the world ever &s;ince the que&s;tion was fir&s;t &s;et afloat by its original propounders.</P>
<P>And as the plain man only got up and walked, to prove there was &s;uch a thing as motion, in an&s;wer to the philo&s;opher who denied it: &s;o the plain Chri&s;|tian, when he is borne down with the a&s;&s;urance that there is no efficacy in prayer, requires no better ar|gument to repel the a&s;&s;ertion than the good he finds in prayer it&s;elf.</P>
<P>All the doubts propo&s;ed to him re&s;pecting God, do not &s;o much affect him as this one doubt re&s;pect|ing him&s;elf: <Q>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.</Q> For the chief doubt and difficulty of a Chri&s;tian con&s;i&s;ts, not &s;o much in a di&s;tru&s;t of God's ability and willingne&s;s to an&s;wer the prayer of the upright, as in a di&s;tru&s;t of his own up|rightne&s;s, and of the quality of the prayer which he offers up.</P>
<P>Let the &s;ubjects of a dark fate maintain a &s;ullen, or the &s;laves of a blind chance a hopele&s;s &s;ilence, but let the child of a compa&s;&s;ionate Almighty Father &s;upplicate his mercies with an humble confidence, in&s;pired by the a&s;&s;urance, that <Q>the very hairs of

his head are numbered.</Q> Let him take comfort in that individual and minute attention, without which not a &s;parrow falls to the ground, as well as in that heart-cheering promi&s;e, that, as <Q>the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous,</Q> &s;o are <Q>his ears open to their prayers.</Q> And as a pious Bi&s;hop has ob&s;erved, <Q>Our Saviour has as it were hedged in and inclo&s;ed the Lord's Prayer with the&s;e two great fences of our faith, God's <HI>willingne&s;s</HI> and his <HI>power</HI> to help us:</Q> the preface to it a&s;&s;ures us of the one, which, by calling God by the tender name of "Our Father," intimates his <HI>readine&s;s</HI> to help his children: and the animating conclu&s;ion, "Thine is the <HI>power,</HI>" re&s;cues us from every unbe|lieving doubt of his <HI>ability</HI> to help us.</P>
<P>A Chri&s;tian knows, becau&s;e he feels, that prayer is, though in a way to him in&s;crutable, the medium of connection between God and his rational crea|tures; the means appointed by him to draw down his ble&s;&s;ings upon us. The Chri&s;tian knows, that prayer is the appointed means of uniting two ideas, one of the highe&s;t magnificence, the other of the mo&s;t profound lowline&s;s, within the compa&s;s of ima|gination; namely, that it is the link of communica|tion between <Q>the High and Lofty One who inha|biteth eternity,</Q> and that heart of the <Q>contrite in which he delights to dwell.</Q> He knows that this inexplicable union between Beings &s;o un&s;peakably,
<PB N="216" REF="037996_0431_100FAD729EB52138">
&s;o e&s;&s;entially different, can only be maintained by prayer.</P>
<P>The plain Chri&s;tian, as was before ob&s;erved, can|not explain why it is &s;o; but while he <HI>feels</HI> the effi|cacy, he is contented to let the learned <HI>define</HI> it; and he will no more po&s;tpone prayer till he can produce a chain of rea&s;oning on the manner in which he de|rives benefit from it, than he will po&s;tpone eating till he can give a &s;cientific lecture on the nature of di|ge&s;tion: he is contented with knowing that his meat has nouri&s;hed him; and he leaves to the philo&s;opher, who may choo&s;e to defer his meal till he has elabo|rated his treati&s;e, to &s;tarve in the interim. The Chri&s;|tian feels better than he is able to explain, that the functions of his &s;piritual life can no more be carried on without habitual prayer, than tho&s;e of his natural life without frequent bodily nouri&s;hment. He feels renovation and &s;trength grow out of the u&s;e of the appointed means, as nece&s;&s;arily in the one ca&s;e as in the other. He feels that the health of his &s;oul can no more be &s;u&s;tained, and its powers kept in continu|ed vigour by the <HI>prayers</HI> of a di&s;tant day, than his body by the <HI>aliment</HI> of a di&s;tant day.</P>
<P>But there is one motive to the duty in que&s;tion, far more con&s;training to the true believer than all others that can be named; more imperious than any argu|ments on its utility, than any convictions of its effi|cacy, even than any experience of its con&s;olations.
<PB N="217" REF="037996_0432_100FAD7587F6B628">
Prayer is the command of God; the plain, po&s;itive, repeated injunction of the Mo&s;t High, who declares, "He will be inquired of." This is enough to &s;ecure the obedience of the Chri&s;tian, even though a pro|mi&s;e were not, as it always is, attached to the com|mand. But in this ca&s;e the promi&s;e is as clear as the precept: "<HI>A&s;k,</HI> and ye &s;hall <HI>receive;</HI>"&mdash;<Q><HI>Seek,</HI> and ye &s;hall <HI>find:</HI> this is enough for the plain Chri&s;tian. As to the <HI>manner</HI> in which prayer is made to coin|cide with the general &s;cheme of God's plan in the government of human affairs; how God has left him|&s;elf at liberty to reconcile our prayer with his own predetermined will, the Chri&s;tian does not very criti|cally examine, his preci&s;e and immediate duty being to pray and not to examine; and probably this being among the &s;ecret things which belong to God,</Q> and not to us, it will lie hidden among tho&s;e num|berle&s;s my&s;teries which we &s;hall not fully under&s;tand till faith is lo&s;t in &s;ight.</P>
<P>In the mean time it is enough for the humble be|liever to be a&s;&s;ured, that the Judge of all the earth is doing right: it is enough for him to be a&s;&s;ured in that word of God "which cannot lie," of number|le&s;s actual in&s;tances of the efficacy of prayer in ob|taining ble&s;&s;ings and averting calamities, both national and individual; it is enough for him to be convinc|ed experimentally, by that internal evidence which is perhaps paramount to all other evidence, the com|fort
<PB N="218" REF="037996_0433_100FAD7869BA6750">
he has received from prayer when all other comforts have failed:&mdash;and above all, to end with the &s;ame motive with which we began, the only mo|tive indeed which <HI>he</HI> requires for the performance of any duty,&mdash;it is motive enough for him, that <HI>thus &s;aith the Lord.</HI> For when a &s;erious Chri&s;tian has once got a plain unequivocal command from his Maker on any point, he never &s;u&s;pends his obedience while he is amu&s;ing him&s;elf with looking about for &s;ubordi|nate motives of action. In&s;tead of curiou&s;ly analy|&s;ing the nature of the duty, he con&s;iders how he &s;hall be&s;t fulfil it: for on the&s;e points at lea&s;t it may be &s;aid without controver&s;y, that <Q>the ignorant (and here who is <HI>not</HI> ignorant?) <HI>have nothing to do with the law but to obey it.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Others there are who perhaps not controverting any of the&s;e premi&s;es, yet neglect to build practical con&s;equences on the admi&s;&s;ion of them; who neither denying the duty nor the efficacy of prayer, yet go on to live either in the irregular ob&s;ervance or the total neglect of it, as appetite, or plea&s;ure, or bu&s;i|ne&s;s, or humour, may happen to predominate; and who by living almo&s;t without prayer, may be &s;aid "to live almo&s;t without God in the world." To &s;uch we can only &s;ay, that they little know what they lo&s;e. The time is ha&s;tening on when they will look upon tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings as invaluable, which now they think not worth a&s;king for. <Q>O that they
<PB N="219" REF="037996_0434_100FAD7B07508F00">
were wife! that they under&s;tood this! that they would con&s;ider their latter end!</Q></P>
<P>There are again others, who it is to be feared, hav|ing once lived in the habit of prayer, yet not having been well-grounded in tho&s;e principles of faith and repentance on which genuine prayer is built, have by degrees totally di&s;continued it. "They do not find," &s;ay they, <Q>that their affairs pro&s;per the better or the wor&s;e; or perhaps they were un&s;ucce&s;sful in their affairs even before they dropt the practice, and &s;o had no encouragement to go on.</Q> They do not <HI>know</HI> that they had no encouragement; they do not <HI>know</HI> how much wor&s;e their affairs might have gone on, had they di&s;continued it &s;ooner, or how their prayers helped to retard their ruin. Or they do not <HI>know</HI> that perhaps "they a&s;ked ami&s;s," or that, if they had obtained what they a&s;ked, they might have been far more unhappy. For a true believer never "re&s;trains prayer," becau&s;e he is not certain he ob|tains every individual reque&s;t; for he is per&s;uaded that God, in compa&s;&s;ion to our ignorance, &s;ometimes in great mercy withholds what we de&s;ire, and often di&s;appoints his mo&s;t favored children by giving them, not what they a&s;k, but what he knows is really good for them. The froward child, as a pious prelate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Hall.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, cries for the &s;hining blade, which the ten|der
<PB N="220" REF="037996_0435_100FAD7C8F72A6A0">
parent withholds, knowing it would cut his fin|gers.</P>
<P>Thus to per&s;evere when we have not the encourage|ment of vi&s;ible &s;ucce&s;s, is an evidence of tried faith. Of this holy per&s;everance Job was a noble in&s;tance. Defeat and di&s;appointment rather &s;timulated than &s;top|ped <HI>his</HI> prayers. Though in a vehement &s;train of pa&s;&s;ionate eloquence he exclaims, <Q>I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment:</Q> yet &s;o per&s;uaded was he of the duty of continuing this holy importunity, that he per&s;i&s;ted again&s;t human hope, till he attained to that pitch of un&s;haken faith, by which he was enabled to break out into that &s;ublime apo&s;trophe, <Q>Though he &s;lay me, I will tru&s;t in him.</Q></P>
<P>But may we not &s;ay that there is a con&s;iderable cla&s;s, who not only bring none of the objections which we have &s;tated again&s;t the u&s;e of prayer; who are &s;o far from rejecting, that they are exact and regular in the performance of it: who yet take it up on as low ground as is con&s;i&s;tent with their ideas of their own &s;afety; who, while they con&s;ider prayer as an indi&s;|pen&s;able form, believe nothing of that change of heart which it is intended to produce? Many who yet ad|here &s;crupulou&s;ly to the letter, are &s;o far from enter|ing into the &s;pirit of this duty, that they are &s;trongly inclined to &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e of hypocri&s;y who adopt the true &s;criptural views of prayer. Nay, as even the
<PB N="221" REF="037996_0436_100FAD80A3957388">
Bible may be &s;o wre&s;ted as to be made to &s;peak al|mo&s;t any language in &s;upport of almo&s;t any opinion, the&s;e per&s;ons lay hold on Scripture it&s;elf to bear them out in their own &s;light views of this duty; and they profe&s;s to borrow from it the ground of that cen&s;ure which they ca&s;t on the more &s;erious Chri&s;tians. Among the many pa&s;&s;ages which have been made to convey a meaning foreign to its original de&s;ign, none has been &s;eized upon with more avidity by &s;uch per|&s;ons than the pointed cen&s;ures of our Saviour on tho&s;e "who for a pretence make long prayers;" as well as on tho&s;e <Q>who u&s;e vain repetitions, and think they &s;hall be heard for much &s;peaking.</Q> Now the things here intended to be reproved, were the hypocri&s;y of the Phari&s;ees and the ignorance of the heathen, to|gether with the error of all tho&s;e who depended on the &s;ucce&s;s of their prayers, while they imitated the deceit of the one or the folly of the other. But our Saviour never meant tho&s;e &s;evere reprehen&s;ions &s;hould cool or abridge the devotion of pious Chri&s;tians, to which they do not apply.</P>
<P>More or fewer words, however, &s;o little con&s;titute the value of prayer, that there is no doubt but one of the mo&s;t affecting &s;pecimens on record is the &s;hort petition of the Publican; full fraught as it is with that &s;pirit of contrition and &s;elf-aba&s;ement which is the very principle and &s;oul of prayer. And this perhaps is the be&s;t model for that &s;udden lifting up
<PB N="222" REF="037996_0437_100FAD838FF2AC10">
of the heart which we call ejaculation. But I doubt, in general, whether the few ha&s;ty words to which the&s;e frugal petitioners would &s;tint the &s;canty devo|tions of others, will be always found ample enough to &s;atisfy the humble penitent, who, being a &s;inner, has much to confe&s;s; who, hoping he is a pardoned &s;inner, has much to acknowledge. Such an one per|haps cannot always pour out the fullne&s;s of his &s;oul within the pre&s;cribed abridgments. Even the &s;incere&s;t Chri&s;tian, when he wi&s;hes to find his heart warm, has often to lament its coldne&s;s. Though he feel that he has received much, and has therefore much to be thankful for, yet he is not able at once to bring his wayward &s;pirit into &s;uch a po&s;ture as &s;hall fit it for the &s;olemn bu&s;ine&s;s; for &s;uch an one has not merely his form to repeat, but he has his peace to make. A devout &s;upplicant too will labour to affect and warm his mind with a &s;en&s;e of the attributes of God, in imitation of the holy men of old. Like Je|ho&s;aphat, he will &s;ometimes enumerate <Q>the power, and the might, and the mercies of the Mo&s;t High,</Q> in order to &s;tir up the &s;entiments of awe and grati|tude, and humility in his own &s;oul.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. xx. 5, 6.</NOTE> He has the ex|ample of his Saviour, who&s;e heart dilated with the expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame holy affections: <Q>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth.</Q> A

heart thus warmed with divine love cannot always &s;crupulou&s;ly limit it&s;elf to the mere <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of pray|er, if I may &s;o &s;peak. The humble &s;upplicant, though he be no longer <HI>governed</HI> by a love of the world, yet grieves to find that he cannot totally exclude it from his thoughts. Though he has on the whole, a deep &s;en&s;e of his own wants, and of God's abund|ant fullne&s;s to &s;upply them, yet when he mo&s;t wi&s;hes to be rejoicing in tho&s;e &s;trong motives for love and gratitude, alas! even then he has to mourn that his thoughts are gone a&s;tray after &s;ome <Q>trifle lighter than vanity it&s;elf.</Q> The be&s;t Chri&s;tian is but too liable, during the temptations of the day, to be en|&s;nared by "the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life," and is not always brought without effort to reflect that he is but du&s;t and a&s;hes. How can even good per&s;ons, who are ju&s;t come perhaps from li&s;tening to the flattery of their fellow-worms, acknowledge before God, without any preparation of the heart, that they are mi&s;erable &s;inners? They require a little time, to impre&s;s on their own &s;ouls the &s;olemn con|fe&s;&s;ion of &s;in they are making to Him, without which brevity and not length might con&s;titute hypocri&s;y. Even the &s;incerely pious have in prayer grievous wanderings to lament, from which others mi&s;taking|ly &s;uppo&s;e the advanced Chri&s;tian to be exempt. Such wanderings that, as an old divine has ob&s;erved, it would exceedingly humble a good man, could he,
<PB N="224" REF="037996_0439_100FAD87B15B9AD8">
after he had prayed, be made to &s;ee his prayers writ|ten down, with interlineations of all the vain and im|pertinent thoughts which had thru&s;t them&s;elves in among&s;t them.

<P>We know that &s;uch a brief petition as, <Q>Lord help my unbelief,</Q> if the &s;upplicant be in &s;o happy a frame, and the prayer be darted with &s;uch &s;trong faith that his very &s;oul mounts with the petition, may &s;uffice to draw down a ble&s;&s;ing which may be with|held from the more prolix petitioner: yet, if by prayer we do not mean a mere form of words, whe|ther they be long or &s;hort; if the true definition of prayer be, that it is <HI>the de&s;ire of the heart;</HI> if it be that &s;ecret communion between God and the &s;oul which is the very breath and being of religion; then is the Scripture &s;o far from &s;ugge&s;ting that &s;hort mea&s;ure of which it is accu&s;ed, that it expre&s;sly &s;ays, "Pray without cea&s;ing:"&mdash;"Pray evermore:"&mdash;<Q>I will that men pray every where;</Q>&mdash;<Q>Continue in&s;tant in prayer.</Q></P>
<P>If &s;uch "repetitions" as the&s;e objectors repro|bate, &s;tir up de&s;ires as yet unawakened, for <Q><HI>vain</HI> repetitions</Q> are &s;uch as awaken or expre&s;s no new

de&s;ire, and &s;erve no religious purpo&s;e, then are "re|petitions" not to be condemned. And if it be true that our Saviour gave the warning again&s;t <Q>long prayers</Q> in the &s;en&s;e the&s;e allege; if he gave the caution again&s;t vain repetitions in the &s;en&s;e the&s;e be|lieve; then he broke his own rule in both in&s;tances: for once we are told <Q>he continued <HI>all night</HI> in pray|er to God.</Q> And again, in a mo&s;t awful cri&s;is of his life, it is expre&s;sly &s;aid, <Q>He prayed the <HI>third time</HI> u&s;ing the <HI>&s;ame words.</HI></Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxvi. 44.</NOTE></P>
<P>But as it is the effect of prayer to <HI>expand</HI> the af|fections as well as <HI>&s;anctify</HI> them, the benevolent Chri&s;tian is not &s;atisfied to commend him&s;elf alone to the Divine favour. The heart which is full of the love of God, will overflow with love to its neighbour. All that are near to him&s;elf he wi&s;hes to bring near to God. Religion makes a man &s;o liberal of &s;oul, that he cannot endure to re&s;trict any thing, much le&s;s divine mercies, to him&s;elf: he &s;piritualizes the &s;ocial affections, by adding inter|ce&s;&s;ory to per&s;onal prayer: for he knows, that pe|titioning for others is one of the be&s;t methods of exerci&s;ing and enlarging our love and charity to|wards them. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to produce any of the numberle&s;s in&s;tances with which Scripture abounds, on the efficacy of interce&s;&s;ion: I &s;hall

confine my&s;elf to a few ob&s;ervations on the benefits it brings to him who offers it.&mdash;When we pray for the objects of our deare&s;t regard, it purifies love: when we pray for tho&s;e with whom we have worldly intercour&s;e, it &s;mooths down the &s;wellings of envy, and bids the tumults of ambition &s;ub&s;ide: when we pray for our country, it &s;anctifies patriot|i&s;m: when we pray for tho&s;e in authority, it adds a divine motive to human obedience: when we pray for our enemies, it &s;oftens the &s;avagene&s;s of war, and mollifies hatred into &s;orrow. And we can be&s;t learn, nay, we can only learn, the difficult duty of forgiving tho&s;e who have offended us, when we bring our&s;elves to pray for them to Him whom we our&s;elves daily offend. When tho&s;e who are the faithful followers of the &s;ame Divine Ma&s;ter pray for each other, the reciprocal interce&s;&s;ion be&s;t real|izes that beautiful idea of <Q>the Communion of Saints.</Q></P>
<P>Some are for confining their interce&s;&s;ions only to the good, as if none but per&s;ons of merit were en|titled to our prayers. Merit! who has it? De&s;ert! who can plead it? in the &s;ight of God, I mean. Who &s;hall bring his own piety, or the piety of others, in the way of <HI>claim</HI> before a Being of &s;uch tran&s;cendent holine&s;s, that <Q>the heavens are not clean in his &s;ight?</Q> And if we wait for perfect holine&s;s as a preliminary to prayer, when &s;hall &s;uch

<P>In clo&s;ing this little work with the &s;ubject of inter|ce&s;&s;ory prayer, may the Author be allowed to avail her&s;elf of the feeling its &s;ugge&s;ts to her own heart? And while &s;he earne&s;tly implores that Being, who can make the meane&s;t of his creatures in&s;trumental to his glory, to ble&s;s this humble attempt to tho&s;e for whom it was written, may &s;he, without pre&s;umption entreat that this work of Chri&s;tian Charity may be reciprocal, and that tho&s;e who peru&s;e the&s;e pages, may put up a petition for her, that in the great day to which we are all ha&s;tening, &s;he may not be found to have &s;ugge&s;ted to others what &s;he her&s;elf did not believe, or to have recommended what &s;he did not de&s;ire to practi&s;e? In that awful day of everla&s;t|ing deci&s;ion, may both the reader and the writer be pardoned and accepted, <Q>not for any works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which they have done,</Q> but through the merits of the GREAT INTERCESSOR.</P>
