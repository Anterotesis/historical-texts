<P>When we behold but the little, &s;eemingly in&s;ignificant ant, what a moral and instruc|tive le&s;&s;on may be drawn from it, in that excellent proverb, "Employ well the hour pre|&s;ent." Idlene&s;s is the cau&s;e of many evils; it brings both mi|&s;ery and want; it destroys the health of body, and the peace of mind.
