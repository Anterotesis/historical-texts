<HEAD>IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN.</HEAD>
<P>I GEORGE WASHINGTON, of MOUNT VERNON, a CITIZEN of the <HI>United States,</HI> and lately <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> of the &s;ame. DO make, ordain, and declare this In&s;trument, which is written with my own hand,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the original manu&s;cript, GEORGE WASHINGTON'S name was written at the bottom of every page.</NOTE> and every page thereof &s;ub&s;cribed with my Name, to be my la&s;t WILL and TESTAMENT, revoking all others.&mdash;<HI>Imprimus.</HI> All my debts, of which there are but few, and none of magnitude, are to be punctually and &s;peedily paid, and the Legacies herein after bequeathed, are to be di&s;charged as &s;oon as circum&s;tances will permit, and in the manner directed.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;To my dearly beloved Wife, <HI>Martha Wa&s;hington,</HI> I give and bequeath the u&s;e, profit and benefit of my whole E&s;|tate, real and per&s;onal, for the term of her natural life, except &s;uch parts thereof as are &s;pecially di&s;po&s;ed of hereafter.&mdash;My improved Lot, in the town of Alexandria, &s;ituated on Pitt and Cameron &s;treets, I give to her and her heirs forever; as I al&s;o do my Hou&s;ehold and Kitchen Furniture, of every &s;ort and kind, with the Liquors and Groceries which may be on hand at the time of my decea&s;e, to be u&s;ed and di&s;po&s;ed of as &s;he may think proper.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;Upon the decea&s;e of my wife, it is my will and de&s;ire that all the Slaves which I hold in my <HI>own right</HI> &s;hall receive their freedom. To emancipate them during her life, would, though earne&s;tly wi&s;hed by me, be attended with &s;uch in&s;upera|ble difficulties, on account of their intermixture by marriages with the dower Negroes, as to excite the mo&s;t painful &s;en&s;ations, if not di&s;agreeable con&s;equences from the latter, while both de|&s;criptions are in the occupancy of the &s;ame proprietor; it not being in my power, under the tenure by which the dower Ne|groes
<PB N="4" REF="038994_0003_10128B3CC1F51D28">
are held, to manumit them. <HI>And whereas,</HI> among tho&s;e who will receive freedom according to this devi&s;e, there may be &s;ome, who from old age or bodily infirmities, and others, who on account of their infancy, that will be unable to &s;upport them|&s;elves, it is my will and de&s;ire, that all who come under the fir&s;t and &s;econd de&s;cription, &s;hall be comfortably clothed and fed by my heirs while they live; and that &s;uch of the latter de&s;crip|tion as have no parents living, or if living, are unable or unwil|ling to provide for them, &s;hall be bound by the court until they &s;hall arrive at the age of twenty five years; and in ca&s;es where no record can be produced, whereby their ages can be a&s;certained, the judgment of the court, upon its own view of the &s;ubject, &s;hall be adequate and final. The Negroes thus bound, are (by their ma&s;ters or mi&s;tre&s;&s;es) to be taught to read and write, and to be brought up to &s;ome u&s;eful occupation, agreeably to the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, providing for the &s;upport of orphan and other poor children. And I do hereby expre&s;sly forbid the &s;ale or tran&s;portation, out of the &s;aid Commonwealth, of any Slave, I may die po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, under any pretence what&s;o|ever. And I do moreover, mo&s;t pointedly and mo&s;t &s;olemnly enjoin it upon my Executors hereafter named, or the &s;urvivor of them, to &s;ee that <HI>this</HI> clau&s;e re&s;pecting Slaves, and every part thereof, be religiou&s;ly fulfilled at the epoch at which it is directed to take place, without eva&s;ion, neglect or delay, after the crops which may then be on the ground are harve&s;ted, par|ticularly as it re&s;pects the aged and infirm; &s;eeing that a regu|lar and permanent fund be e&s;tabli&s;hed for their &s;upport, as long as there are &s;ubjects requiring it; not tru&s;ting to the uncertain provi&s;ion to be made by individuals: And to my mulatto man, <HI>William,</HI> (calling him&s;elf William Lee) I give immediate freedom, or if he &s;hould prefer it (on account of the accidents which have befallen him, and which have rendered him incapa|ble of walking, or of any active employment) to remain in the &s;ituation he now is, it &s;hall be optional in him to do &s;o; in ei|ther ca&s;e, however, I allow him an annuity of Thirty Dollars during his natural life, which &s;hall be independent of the vict|uals and clothes he has been accu&s;tomed to receive, if he choo&s;es the la&s;t alternative; but in full with his freedom, if he prefers the fir&s;t; and this I give him, as a te&s;timony of my &s;en&s;e of his attachment to me, and for his faithful &s;ervices during the Revo|lutionary War.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;To the Tru&s;tees (Governors, or by what&s;oever other name they may be de&s;ignated) of the Academy, in the town of Alexandria, I give and bequeath, in tru&s;t, Four Thou&s;and Dol|lars,
<PB N="5" REF="038994_0004_10128B40AC043810">
or in other words, twenty of the Shares which I hold in the Bank of Alexandria, towards the &s;upport of a Free School, e&s;|tabli&s;hed at, and annexed to, the &s;aid Academy, for the purpo&s;e of educating &s;uch Orphan Children, or the Children of &s;uch other poor and indigent per&s;ons, as are unable to accompli&s;h it with their own means; and who, in the judgment of the Tru&s;|tees of the &s;aid Seminary, are be&s;t entitled to the benefit of this donation. The afore&s;aid 20 Shares I give and bequeath in perpetuity; the dividends only of which are to be drawn for, and applied by the &s;aid Tru&s;tees, for the time being, for the u&s;es abovementioned; the Stock to remain entire and untouched, unle&s;s indications of failure of &s;aid Bank &s;hould be &s;o apparent, or a di&s;continuance thereof, &s;hould render a removal of this fund nece&s;&s;ary. In either of the&s;e ca&s;es, the amount of the Stock here devi&s;ed is to be ve&s;ted in &s;ome other bank, or public in&s;ti|tution, whereby the intere&s;t may with regularity and certainty be drawn and applied as above: And, to prevent mi&s;conception, my meaning is, and is hereby declared to be, that the&s;e Twenty Shares are in lieu of, and not in addition to, the Thou&s;and Pounds given by a mi&s;&s;ive letter &s;ome years ago; in con&s;e|quence whereof, an annuity of Fifty Pounds has &s;ince been paid towards the &s;upport of this in&s;titution.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;WHEREAS by a law of the Commonwealth of Vir|ginia, enacted in the year 1785, the Legi&s;lature thereof, was plea&s;ed, as an evidence of its approbation of the &s;ervices I had rendered the public, during the Revolution, and partly I be|lieve, in con&s;ideration of my having &s;ugge&s;ted the va&s;t advanta|ges which the community would derive from the exten&s;ion of its inland navigation under Legi&s;lative patronage, to pre&s;ent me with One hundred &s;hares, of One Hundred Dollars each, in the incorporated Company, e&s;tabli&s;hed for the purpo&s;e of ex|tending the navigation of James' River, from tide water to the mountains;&mdash;and al&s;o with Fifty &s;hares of &pound;100 &s;terling each, in the corporation of another company likewi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;imilar purpo&s;e of opening the navigation of the river Po|towmack, from the tide water to Fort Cumberland; the ac|ceptance of which, although the offer was highly honorable and grateful to my feelings, was refu&s;ed, as incon&s;i&s;tent with a prin|ciple which I had adopted, and had never departed from&mdash;viz. not to receive pecuniary compen&s;ation for any &s;ervices I could render my country in its arduous &s;truggle with Greatbritain for its rights; and becau&s;e I had evaded &s;imilar propo&s;itions from other States in the Union. Adding to this refu&s;al, how|ever, an intimation that, if it &s;hould be the plea&s;ure of the leg|i&s;lature,
<PB N="6" REF="038994_0005_10128B44E68AA748">
to permit me to appropriate the &s;aid &s;hares to <HI>public u&s;es,</HI> I would receive them on tho&s;e terms with due &s;en&s;ibility; and this it having con&s;ented to, in flattering terms, as will ap|pear by a &s;ub&s;equent law, and &s;undry re&s;olutions, in the mo&s;t ample and honorable manner, I proceed after this recital, for the more correct under&s;tanding of the ca&s;e, to declare&mdash;That as it has always been a &s;ource of &s;erious regret with me, to &s;ee the youth of the&s;e United States &s;ent to foreign countries for the purpo&s;e of Education, often before their minds were formed, or they had imbibed any adequate ideas of the happine&s;s of their own; con|tracting too frequently, not only habits of di&s;&s;ipation and extrav|agance, but principles unfriendly to Republican Government, and to the true and genuine liberties of mankind; which there|after are rarely overcome.&mdash;For the&s;e rea&s;ons it has been my ardent wi&s;h, to &s;ee a plan devi&s;ed on a liberal &s;cale, which would have a tendency to &s;pread &s;y&s;tematic ideas through all parts of this ri&s;ing empire, thereby to do away local attachments and State prejudices, as far as the nature of things would, or indeed ought to admit, from our National Councils.&mdash;Looking anxiou&s;ly forward to the accompli&s;hment of &s;o de&s;irable an ob|ject as this is, (in my e&s;timation) my mind has not been able to contemplate any plan more likely to effect the mea&s;ure than the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an UNIVERSITY in a central part of the U|nited States, to which the Youths of fortune and talents from all parts thereof, may be &s;ent for the completion of their educa|tion, in all the branches of polite literature; in arts and &s;cien|ces, in acquiring knowledge in the principles of politics and good government, and, (as a matter of infinite importance in my judgment) by a&s;&s;ociating with each other&punc; and forming friend&s;hips in juvenile years, be enabled to free them&s;elves, in a proper degree, from tho&s;e local prejudices and habitual jealou&s;ies which have ju&s;t been mentioned; and which, when carried to exce&s;s, are never &s;ailing &s;ources of di&s;quietude to the public mind and pregnant of mi&s;chievous con&s;equences to this country, under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, &s;o fully dilated.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;I give and bequeath in perpetuity, the Fifty &s;hares which I hold in the Potowmack company (under the afore&s;aid acts of the Legi&s;lature of Virginia) towards the endowment of an U|NIVERSITY&punc; to be e&s;tabli&s;hed within the limits of the di&s;trict of Columbia, under the au&s;pices of the General Government, if that government &s;hould incline to extend a fo&s;tering hand towards it; and until &s;uch Seminary is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the funds ari&s;ing on the&s;e &s;hares &s;hall be required for its &s;upport, my further WILL and de&s;ire is that the profit accruing therefrom, &s;hall, whenever
<PB N="7" REF="038994_0006_10128B4923F790B8">
the dividends are made, be laid out in purcha&s;ing Stock in the Bank of Columbia, or &s;ome other Bank, at the di&s;cretion of my Excutors, or by the Trea&s;urer of the United States for the time being, under the direction of Congre&s;s&mdash;provided that Honorable body &s;hould patronize the mea&s;ure; and the divi|dends proceeding from the purcha&s;e of &s;uch Stock, is to be ve&s;t|ed in more Stock, and &s;o on, until a &s;um, adequate to the accom|pli&s;hment of the object is obtained; of which I have not the &s;malle&s;t doubt before many years pa&s;s away, even if no aid or encouragement is given by the Legi&s;lative authority, or from any other &s;ource.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;The Hundred Shares which I hold in the James River Company, I have given, and now confirm in perpetu|ity, to and for the u&s;e and benefit of Liberty Hall Academy, in the Country of Rockbridge, in the Commonwealth of Vir|ginia.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;I relea&s;e, exonerate, and di&s;charge the E&s;tate of my decea&s;ed Brother <HI>Samuel Wa&s;hington,</HI> from the payment of the money which is due to me for the land I &s;old to <HI>Philip Pendleton</HI> (lying in the County of Berkley) who a&s;&s;igned the &s;ame to him, the &s;aid <HI>Samuel,</HI> who by agreement, was to pay me therefor: <HI>And whereas,</HI> by &s;ome contract, (the purport of which was never communicated to me, between the &s;aid <HI>Samuel</HI> and his &s;on, <HI>Thornton Wa&s;hington,</HI> the latter became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the afore&s;aid Land, without any conveyance having pa&s;&s;ed from me, either to the &s;aid <HI>Pendleton,</HI> the &s;aid <HI>Samuel,</HI> or the &s;aid <HI>Thornton,</HI> and without any con&s;ideration having been made, by which neglect neither the legal nor equitable title has been alienated; it re&s;ts therefore with me to declare my inten|tions concerning the premi&s;es; and the&s;e are to give and be|queath the &s;aid land to whom&s;oever the &s;aid <HI>Thornton Wa&s;h|ington</HI> (who is al&s;o dead) devi&s;ed the &s;ame, or to his heirs for|ever, if he died inte&s;tate, exonerating the e&s;tate of the &s;aid <HI>Thornton,</HI> equally with that of the &s;aid <HI>Samuel,</HI> from pay|ment of the purcha&s;e money, which, with intere&s;t, agreeably to the original contract with the &s;aid <HI>Pendleton,</HI> would amount to more than a Thou&s;and Pounds; <HI>And whereas,</HI> two other &s;ons of my &s;aid decea&s;ed Brother <HI>Samuel,</HI> namely <HI>George Steptoe Wa&s;hington,</HI> and <HI>Lawrence Augu&s;tine Wa&s;hington,</HI> were, by the decea&s;e of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e to who&s;e care they were committed, brought under my protection, and in con&s;equence, have occa&s;|ioned advances on my part, for their education at College, and other &s;chools, for their board, clothing, and other incidental expen&s;es, to the amount of near Five Thou&s;and Dollars, over

<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;The balance due to me from the e&s;tate of <HI>Bartholo|mew Dandridge,</HI> decea&s;ed, (my Wife's Brother) and which amounted on the fir&s;t day of October, 1795, to four hundred and twentyfive pounds, (as will appear by an account ren|dered by his decea&s;ed &s;on <HI>John Dandridge,</HI> who was the act|ing executor of his father's will) I relea&s;e and acquit from the payment thereof&mdash;and the Negroes (then thirtythree in num|ber formerly belonging to the &s;aid e&s;tate, who were taken in execution, &s;old and purcha&s;ed in on my account, in the year <HI>(blank)</HI> and ever &s;ince have remained in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and to the u&s;e of <HI>Mary,</HI> widow of the &s;aid <HI>Bartholomew Dandridge,</HI> with their increa&s;e, it is my WILL and DESIRE &s;hall continue and be in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, without paying hire, or making com|pen&s;ation for the &s;ame, for the time pa&s;t or to come, during her natural life; at the expiration of which, I direct that all of them who are forty years old and upwards, &s;hall receive their free|dom; and all under that age and above &s;ixteen, &s;hall &s;erve &s;ev|en years and no longer; and all under &s;ixteen years &s;hall &s;erve until they are twentyfive years of age, and then be free&mdash;and to avoid di&s;putes re&s;pecting the ages of any of the&s;e Negroes, they are to be taken into the court of the County in which they re&s;ide, and the judgment thereof, in this relation, &s;hall be final, and record thereof made, which may be adduced as evidence at any time thereafter, if di&s;putes &s;hould ari&s;e concerning the &s;ame&mdash;And I further direct that the heirs of the &s;aid <HI>Bartholomew Dandridge</HI> &s;hall, equally &s;hare the benefits ari&s;ing from the &s;er|vices of the &s;aid negroes, according to the tenor of this devi&s;e, upon the decea&s;e of their mother.</P>

<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;To my Nephew, <HI>Bu&s;hrod Wa&s;hington,</HI> I give and bequeath all the Papers in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which relate to my civil and military admini&s;tration, of the affairs of this country&mdash;I leave to him al&s;o, &s;uch of my private Papers as are worth pre|&s;erving; and at the decea&s;e of my Wife, and before, if &s;he is not inclined to retain them, I give and bequeath my Library of Books and Pamphlets of every kind.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;Having &s;old lands which I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the State of Penn&s;ylvania, and part of a tract held in equal right with <HI>George Clinton,</HI> late Governor of Newyork; in the State of Newyork, my &s;hare of land and intere&s;t, in the Great Di&s;mal Swamp, and a tract of land which I owned in the County of Glouce&s;ter&mdash;withholding the legal titles thereto, until the con|&s;ideration money &s;hould be paid&mdash;and having moreover lea&s;ed, and conditionally &s;old (as will appear by the tenor of the &s;aid lea&s;es) all my lands upon the Great Kenhawa, and a tract upon Difficult run, in the County of Loudoun, it is my WILL and DIRECTION, that when&s;oever the contracts are fully and re|&s;pectively complied with, according to the &s;pirit, true intent, and meaning thereof, on the part of the purcha&s;ers, their heirs or a&s;&s;igns, that then, and in that ca&s;e, conveyances are to be made, agreeable to the terms of the &s;aid contracts, and the money ari&s;ing therefrom, when paid, to be ve&s;ted in Bank Stock;&mdash;the dividends whereof, as of that al&s;o which is already ve&s;ted therein, is to inure to my &s;aid Wife during her life, but the Stock it&s;elf is to remain and be &s;ubject to the general di&s;tribu|tion hereafter directed.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;To the <HI>Earl of Buchan</HI> I recommit the "Box made of the Oak, that &s;heltered the great Sir <HI>William Wallace,</HI> after the battle of Falkirk" pre&s;ented to me by his Lord&s;hip in terms too flattering for me to repeat, with a reque&s;t "to pa&s;s it, on the event of my decea&s;e, to the man in my country, who &s;hould appear to merit it be&s;t, upon the &s;ame conditions that have induced him to &s;end it to me." Whether ea&s;y or not to &s;elect the <HI>Man</HI> who might comport with his Lord&s;hip's opinion in this re&s;pect, is not for me to &s;ay; but conceiving that no di&s;po&s;ition of this valuable curio&s;ity can be more eligible than the recommitment of it to his own cabinet, agreeably to the o|riginal

de&s;ign of the Gold&s;miths' company of Edinburgh, who pre&s;ented it to him, and at his reque&s;t, con&s;ented that it &s;hould be transferred to me&mdash;I do give and bequeath the &s;ame to his Lord&s;hip; and in ca&s;e of his decea&s;e, to his heir, with my grateful thanks for the di&s;tingui&s;hed honor of pre&s;enting it to me, and more e&s;pecially for the favorable &s;entiments with which he accompanied it.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;To my Brother <HI>Charles Wa&s;hington,</HI> I give and be|queath the gold headed Cane, left me by Dr. <HI>Franklin</HI> in his will. I add nothing to it, becau&s;e of the ample provi&s;ion I have made for his i&s;&s;ue. To the acquaintances and friends of any juvenile years, <HI>Lawrence Wa&s;hington</HI> and <HI>Robert Wa&s;h|ington,</HI> of Chotanck, I give my other two gold headed Canes, having my arms engraved on them; and to each, as they will be u&s;eful where they live, I leave one of the Spygla&s;&s;es, which con&s;tituted part of my equipage during the late war. To my Compatriot in arms and old and intimate Friend, Dr. <HI>Craik,</HI> I give my Bureau (or, as the cabinet makers call it, Tambour Secretary) and the circular Chair, an appendage of my &s;tudy. To Dr. <HI>David Stuart</HI> I give my large Shaving and Dre&s;&s;ing Table, and my Tele&s;cope. To the Reverend, now <HI>Bryan, Lord Fairfax,</HI> I give a Bible, in three large folio volumes, with notes&mdash;pre&s;ented to me by the Rt. Rev. <HI>Thomas Wil&s;on,</HI> Bi&s;hop of Sodor and Mann. To General <HI>De La Fayette</HI> I give a pair of finely wrought &s;teel Pi&s;tols, taken from the ene|my in the revolutionary war. To my Si&s;ters in Law, <HI>Hannah Wa&s;hington</HI> and <HI>Mildred Wa&s;hington</HI>&mdash;to my friends <HI>Elea|nor Stuart, Hannah Wa&s;hington,</HI> of Fairfield, and <HI>Elizabeth Wa&s;hington</HI> of Hayfield, I give, each a mourning ring, of the value of one hundred dollars. The&s;e beque&s;ts are not made for the intrin&s;ic value of them, but as mementos of my e&s;teem and regard. To <HI>Tobias Lear,</HI> I give the u&s;e of the Farm which he now holds, in virtue of a lea&s;e from me to him and his de|cea&s;ed wife (for and during their natural lives) free from rent during his life; at the expiration of which, it is to be di&s;po&s;ed of as is herein after directed. To <HI>Sally B. Haynie,</HI> (a di&s;tant relation of mine) I give and bequeath three hundred dollars. To <HI>Sarah Green,</HI> daughter of the decea&s;ed <HI>Thomas Bi&s;hop,</HI> and to <HI>Ann Walker,</HI> daughter of <HI>John Alton,</HI> al&s;o decea&s;ed, I give each one hundred dollars in con&s;ideration of the attach|ment of their fathers to me; each of whom having lived near|ly forty years in my family.

<PB N="14" REF="038994_0013_10128B5F0342D6C0">
I give and bequeath one other part, that is, a third thereof to each of them. And if it &s;hould &s;o happen, that any of the per|&s;ons who&s;e names are here enumerated (unknown to me) &s;hould now be dead, or &s;hould die before me, that in either of the&s;e ca&s;es, the heirs of &s;uch decea&s;ed per&s;on &s;hall, notwith&s;tanding, derive all the benefits of the beque&s;t in the &s;ame manner, as if he or &s;he was actually living at the time. And by way of advice, I recommend it to my Executors not to be precipitate of di&s;po&s;|ing of the landed property (herein directed to be &s;old) if from temporary cau&s;es, the &s;ale thereof &s;hould be dull; experience having fully evinced, that the price of land, (e&s;pecially above the falls of the river, and on the we&s;tern waters) have been pro|gre&s;&s;ively ri&s;ing, and cannot be long checked in its increa&s;ing value. And I particularly recommend it to &s;uch of the Lega|tees (under this clau&s;e of my will) as can make it convenient, to take each a &s;hare of my &s;tock in the Potowmack Company, in preference to the amount of what it might &s;ell for; being tho|roughly convinced my&s;elf, that no u&s;es to which the money can be applied, will be &s;o productive as the tolls ari&s;ing from this nav|igation when in full operation, (and thus, from the nature of things, it mu&s;t be, ere long) and more e&s;pecially if that of the Shenandoah is added thereto.</P>
<P>The family vault at Mount Vernon requiring repairs, and being improperly &s;ituated be&s;ides, I de&s;ire, that a new one of brick, and upon a larger &s;cale, may be built at the foot of what is commonly called the Vineyard Inclo&s;ure, on the ground which is marked out: In which my remains, with tho&s;e of my decea&s;ed relations, (now in the old vault) and &s;uch others of my family as may choo&s;e to be entombed there, may be depo&s;ited.

I hope and tru&s;t that no di&s;putes will ari&s;e concerning them. But if, contrary to expectation, the ca&s;e &s;hould be otherwi&s;e from the want of legal expre&s;&s;ions, or the u&s;ual technical terms, or becau&s;e too much or too little has been &s;aid on any of the de|vi&s;es to be con&s;onant with law, my will and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ction expre&s;sly is, that all di&s;putes, (if unhappily any &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">) &s;hall be de|cided by three impartial and intelligent men, known for their probity and good under&s;tanding; two to be cho&s;en by the di&s;|putants, each having the choice of one, and the third by tho&s;e two&mdash;which three men, thus cho&s;en, &s;hall, unfettered by law, or le|gal con&s;tructions, declare their &s;en&s;e of the Te&s;tator's intention; and &s;uch deci&s;ion is, to all intents and purpo&s;es, to be as binding on the parties as if it had been given in the Supreme Court of the United States.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES.</HEAD>
<P><HI>(a)</HI> THIS tract, for the &s;ize of it, is valuable, more for its &s;it|uation than the quality of its &s;oil; though that is good for farm|ing, with a con&s;iderable proportion of ground that might very ea&s;ily be improved into meadow. It lies on the great road from the city of Wa&s;hington, Alexandria and Georgetown, to Lee&s;|burgh and Winche&s;ter. At Difficult Bridge, nineteen miles from Alexandria, le&s;s from the city of Georgetown, and not more than three from Matildaville, at the Great Falls of Potow|mack there is a valuable &s;eat on the premi&s;es, and the whole is conditionally &s;old for the &s;um annexed in the &s;chedule.</P>
<P><HI>(b)</HI> What the &s;elling prices of lands, in the vicinity of the&s;e two tracts, are, I know not; but&punc; compared with tho&s;e above the ridge and others below them, he value annexed will appear moderate; a le&s;s one would not obtain them from me.</P>
<P><HI>(c)</HI> The &s;urrounding land, not &s;uperior in &s;oil. &s;ituation or properties of any &s;ort, &s;ell currently at from twenty to thirty dol|lars an acre. The lowe&s;t price is affixed to the&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>(d)</HI> The ob&s;ervations, made in the la&s;t note, apply equally to this <HI>tract;</HI> being in the vicinity of them, and of &s;imilar quality, although it lies in another country.</P>
<P><HI>(e)</HI> This tract, though &s;mall, is extremely valuable. It has on Potowmack River, about 12 miles above the town of Bath or Warm Springs, and is in the &s;hape of a hor&s;e&s;hoe; the river run|ning almo&s;t around it. Two hundred acres of it is rich low grounds, with a great abundance of the large&s;t and fine&s;t walnut trees; which with the produce of the &s;oil might, (by means of the improved navigation of the Potowmack) be brought to a &s;hipping port, with more ea&s;e, and at a &s;maller expen&s;e, than that which is tran&s;ported 30 miles only, by land:</P>
<P><HI>(f)</HI> This tract is of &s;econd rate Glouce&s;ter low ground; it has no improvements thereon, but lies on navigable water, a|bounding in fi&s;h and oy&s;ters. It was received in payment of a debt, (carrying intere&s;t) and valued in the year 1789, by an im|partial gentleman, to &pound;800. N. B. It has lately been &s;old and there is due there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n a balance, equal to what is annexed in the &s;chedule.</P>
<P><HI>(g)</HI> The&s;e 373 acres are the third part of undivided purcha&s;e made by the decea&s;ed Fielding Lewis, Thomas Walker and my|&s;elf; on full conviction that they would become valuable. The Lord lies on the road from Suffolk and Norfolk, touches, (if I am not mi&s;taken) &s;ome part of the navigable water of Nan&s;e|mond river; the Rich Di&s;mal Swamp is capable of great im|provement; and from its &s;ituation mu&s;t become extremely val|uable.</P>
<P><HI>(h)</HI> This is an undivided intere&s;t, which I held in the Great Di&s;mal Swamp company, containing about 4000 acres, with my part of the plantation and &s;tock thereon, belonging to the com|pany in the &s;aid Swamp.</P>
<P><HI>(i)</HI> The&s;e &s;everal tracts of land are of the fir&s;t quality on
<PB N="21" REF="038994_0019_10128B713B535120">
the Ohio river, in the parts where they are &s;ituated; being al|mo&s;t, if not altogether, river bottoms. The &s;malle&s;t of the&s;e tracts is actually &s;old at ten dollars an acre, but the con&s;idera|tion therefor not received. The re&s;t are equally valuable, and &s;old as high; e&s;pecially that which lies ju&s;t below the Little Kenhawa, and is oppo&s;ite to a thick &s;ettlement on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river. The four tracts have an aggregate breadth upon, the river of &s;ixteen miles, and is bounded thereby that di&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>(k)</HI> The&s;e tracts are &s;ituated on the Great Kenhawa river, and the fir&s;t four are bounded thereby for more than forty miles. It is acknowledged by all who have &s;een them, (and of the tract containing 10990 acres, which I have been on my&s;elf, I can a&s;&s;ert) that there is no richer or more valuable land in all that region; they are conditionally &s;old for the &s;um mentioned in the &s;chedule, that is&punc; 200,000 dollars; and if the terms of that &s;ale are not complied with, they will command con&s;iderably more. The tract, of which the 125 acres is a moiety, was taken up by General Andrew Lewis and my&s;elf, for, and on account of a bituminous &s;pring which it contains, of &s;o inflammable a nature as to burn as freely as &s;pirits, and is as nearly difficult to extin|gui&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>(l)</HI> I am but little acquainted with this land, although I have once been on it. It was received, (many years &s;ince) in di&s;|charge of a debt to me from Daniel Janifer Adams at the value annexed thereto, and mu&s;t be worth more. It is very level; lies near the river Potowmack.</P>
<P><HI>(m)</HI> This tract lies about 30 miles above the city of Wa&s;hing|ton, not far from Kittoctan. It is good farming land and by tho&s;e who are well acquainted with it, I am informed that it would &s;ell at twelve or fifteen dollars per acre.</P>
<P><HI>(n)</HI> This land is valuable on account of its local &s;ituation, and other properties. It affords an exceeding good &s;tand on Brad|dock's road, from Fort Cumberland to Pitt&s;burgh, and be&s;ides a fertile &s;oil po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a large quantity of natural meadow, fit for the &s;cythe. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of the Great Meadows, where the fir&s;t action with the French in 1754 was fought.</P>
<P><HI>(o)</HI> This is the moiety of about 2000 acres, which remains un|&s;old of 6071 acres on the Mohawk river, (Montgomery county) in a patent granted to <HI>Daniel Coxe,</HI> in the town&s;hip of Coxebo|rough and Carolinas, as will appear by deed from <HI>Marinas Wil|let</HI> and wife, to <HI>George Clinton,</HI> (late Governor of Newyork) and my&s;elf. The latter &s;ales have been at &s;ix dollars an acre, and what remains un&s;old, will fetch that or more</P>
<P><HI>(p)</HI> The quality of the&s;e lands and their &s;ituations, may be known by the &s;urveyors' certificates, which are filed along with the patents. They lie in the vicinity of Cincinnati; one tract near the mouth of the Little Miami; another &s;even, and the third ten miles up the &s;ame. I have been informed that they will com|mand more than they are e&s;timated at.</P>
<P><HI>(q)</HI> For the de&s;cription of the&s;e tracts in detail, &s;ee <HI>General Spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">'s</HI> letters, filed with the other papers relating to them.
<PB N="22" REF="038994_0020_10128B72D5FC43F0">
Be&s;ides the general good quality of the land, there is a valuable bank of Iron Ore thereon, which when the &s;ettlement becomes more populous, (and &s;ettlers are moving that way very fa&s;t) will be found very valuable; as the Rough Creek, a branch of Green River, affords ample water for furnaces and forges.</P>
<P>LOTS, viz. CITY OF WASHINGTON.</P>
<P><HI>(r)</HI> The two lots near the Capital in &s;quare 634, co&s;t me 963 dollars only. But in this price I was favored, on condition that I &s;hould build two brick hou&s;es, three &s;tories high each; without this reduction, the &s;elling prices of tho&s;e lots would have co&s;t me about 1350 dollars. The&s;e lots, with the buildings thereon, when completed, will &s;tand me in 15,000 dollars at lea&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>(s)</HI> Lots No. 5, 12, 13 and 14, on the Ea&s;tern branch, are ad|vantageou&s;ly &s;ituated on the water, and although many lots, much le&s;s convenient, have &s;old a great deal higher, I will rate the&s;e at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">2 cents the &s;quare foot only.</P>
<P>ALEXANDRIA.</P>
<P><HI>(t)</HI> For this lot, though unimproved, I have refu&s;ed 3500 dol|lars. It has &s;ince been laid out into proper &s;ized lots for build|ing on; three or four of which are let on ground rent forever, at three dollars a foot on the &s;treet, and this price is a&s;ked for both fronts on Pitt and Prince&s;s &s;treet.</P>
<P>WINCHESTER.</P>
<P><HI>(u)</HI> As neither the lot in the town or common have any im|provements on them, it is not ea&s;y to fix a price; but as both are well &s;ituated&punc; it is pre&s;umed that the price annexed to them in the &s;chedule is a rea&s;onable valuation.</P>
<P>BATH.</P>
<P><HI>(v)</HI> The lots in Bath, (two adjoining) co&s;t me, to the be&s;t of my recollection, between fifty and &s;ixty pounds, 20 years ago; and the buildings thereon, 150<HI>l.</HI> more. Whether property there has increa&s;ed or decrea&s;ed in its value, and in what condi|tion the hou&s;es are, I am ignorant; but &s;uppo&s;e they are not valued too high.</P>
<P>STOCK.</P>
<P><HI>(w)</HI> The&s;e are the &s;ums which are actually funded; and though no more in the aggregate than 7566 dollars, &s;tand me in at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and pounds, Virginia money, being the amount of bonded and other debts, due to me, and di&s;charged during the war, when money had depreciated in that rate, &rindx;and was &s;o &s;ettled by public authority.</P>
<P><HI>(x)</HI> The value annexed to the&s;e &s;hares is what they have ac|tually co&s;t me, and is the price affixed by law; and although the pre&s;ent &s;elling price is under par, my advice to the Legatees. (for who&s;e benefit they are intended, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who can afford
<PB N="23" REF="038994_0021_10128B75B81C22C0">
to lie out of the money) is, that each &s;hould take and hold one; there being a moral certainty of a great and increa&s;ing profit, ari&s;ing from them in the cour&s;e of a few years.</P>
<P><HI>(y)</HI> It is &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;hares in the James River Com|pany mu&s;t be productive. But of this I can give no decided o|pinion, for want of more accurate information.</P>
<P><HI>(z)</HI> The&s;e are the nominal prices of the Shares in the banks of Alexandria and Columbia; the &s;elling prices vary according to circum&s;tances; but as the &s;tock u&s;ually divide from eight to ten per cent per annum, they mu&s;t be worth the former, at lea&s;t, &s;o long as the banks are conceived to be &s;ecure, although from circum&s;tances, they may &s;ometimes be below it.</P>
<P>The value of the live &s;tock depends more upon the quality than quantity of the different &s;pecies of it, and this again upon the demand and judgment, or fancy of purcha&s;ers.</P>
