<HEAD>THE Two Wealthy Farmers, &amp;c PART IV.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as it was &s;old, Bragwell again &s;aid &s;oftly to Worthy, "Five from fifty, and there remain forty-five. The dinner and drink won't co&s;t me five pounds, and I have got fifty more than the land was worth. Spend a &s;hilling to gain a pound, this is what I call practical Arith|metic, Mr. Worthy."</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy was glad to get out of this &s;cene; and &s;eeing that his friend was quite &s;ober, he re&s;olved as they rode hom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to deal plainly with him. Bragwell had found out among his calculations, that &s;ome &s;ins could only be committed by a prudent man one at a time. For in&s;tance&punc; he knew that a man could not well get rich and get drunk at the &s;ame mome<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> but he had found out that &s;ome vices made very good company together; &s;o, while he had watched him&s;elf in drinking, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t he &s;hould become as unfit to &s;ell as his gue&s;ts were to buy, he had indulged wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hout mea&s;ure in the good dinner he had provi|ded.
<PB N="3" REF="037135_0003_100C92AE9C686E30">
Mr. Worthy, I &s;ay, &s;eeing him able to bear rea&s;on, rebuked him for this day's proceedings with &s;ome &s;everity. Bragwell bore his reproofs with that &s;ort of patience which ari&s;es from an opinion of one's own wi&s;dom, and a recent flu&s;h of pro&s;perity. He behaved with that good-humour which grows out of vanity and good luck. "You are too &s;quemi&s;h, Mr. Worthy," &s;aid he, "I have done nothing di&s;creditable. The&s;e men came with their eyes open. There is no compul&s;ion u&s;ed. They are free to bid or to let it alone. I make them welcome, and I &s;hall not be thought a bit the wor&s;e of to-morrow, when they are &s;ober. Others do it be|&s;ides me, and I &s;hall never be a&s;hamed of any thing as long as I have cu&s;tom on my &s;ide.</P>
<LETTER>
<P><HI>Worthy.</HI> "I am &s;orry, Mr. Bragwell, to hear you &s;upport &s;uch practices by &s;uch arguments. There is not perhaps a more dangerous &s;nare to the &s;ouls of men than is to be found in that word CUSTOM. It is a word invented to reconcile corrupti|on with credit and &s;in with &s;afety. But no cu&s;tom, no fa&s;hion, no combination of men to &s;et up a fal&s;e &s;tandand can ever
<PB N="4" REF="037135_0004_100C92B094ED25B0">
make a wrong action right. That a thing is often done, is &s;o far from a proof of its being right, that it is the very rea&s;on which will &s;et a thinking man to inquire if it be not really wrong, le&s;t he &s;hould be following "a multitude to do evil." Right is right, though only one man in a thou&s;and pur&s;ues it, and wrong will be for ever wrong, though it be the allowed practice of the other nine hundred and ninety-nine. If this &s;hameful cu&s;tom is really common, which I can hardly be|lieve, that is a fre&s;h rea&s;on why a con&s;ci|entious man &s;hould &s;et his face again&s;t it. And I mu&s;t go &s;o far as to &s;ay (you will excu&s;e me Mr. Bragwell) that I &s;ee no great difference in the eye of con&s;cience, whatever there may be in the eye of law, between your making a man lo&s;e his rea|&s;on, and then getting 50 guineas out of his pocket <HI>because</HI> he has lo&s;t it, and your picking the fifty guineas out of his pocket if you had met him dead drunk in his way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ome to-night. Nay, he who meets a man already drunk and robs him, com|mits but one &s;in, while he who makes him drunk fir&s;t that he may rob him afterwards, commits two."</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="037135_0005_100C92B30C254890">Bragwell gravely replied, "Mr. Wor|thy, while I have the practice of people of credit to &s;upport me, and the law of the land to protect me, I &s;ee no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of any thing I do."&mdash;"Mr. Brag|well, an&s;wered Worthy, a truly hone&s;t man is not always looking &s;harp about him, to &s;ee how far cu&s;tom and the law will bear him out; if he be hone&s;t on princi|ple he will con&s;ult the law of his con&s;ci|ence, and if he be a Chri&s;tian he will con&s;ult the written law of God.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this rebuff, Mr. Brag|well got home in high &s;pirits, for no argu|ments could hinder him from feeling that he had the 50 guineas in his pur&s;e. As &s;oon as he came in, he threw the money he had received on the table, and de&s;ired his wife to lock it up. In&s;tead of receiv|ing it with her u&s;ual &s;atisfaction, &s;he bur&s;t into a violent fit of pa&s;&s;ion, and threw it back to him. "You may keep your ca&s;h your&s;elf, &s;aid &s;he. It is all over: we want no more money. You are a ruined man! A wicked creature, &s;craping and working as we have done for her!" Brag|we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l trembled, but dur&s;t not a&s;k what he dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aded to hear. His wife &s;pared him
<PB N="6" REF="037135_0006_100C92B4F2D04D00">
the trouble, by crying out, as &s;oon as her rage permitted, "Polly is gone off!" Poor Bragwell's heart &s;unk within him; he grew &s;ick and giddy, and as his wife's rage &s;wallowed up her grief, &s;o in his grief he almo&s;t forgot his anger. The pur&s;e fell from his hand, and he ca&s;t a look of angui&s;h upon it, finding, for the fir&s;t time, that it could not relieve his mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy, who though much con|cerned, was le&s;s di&s;compo&s;ed now, called to mind that the young lady had not re|turned with her mother and &s;i&s;ter the night before: he begged Mrs. Bragwell to explain the &s;ad &s;tory. She, in&s;tead of &s;oothing her hu&s;band, fell to reproaching him. "It is all your fault, &s;aid &s;he, you were a fool for your pains. If I had had my way, the girls never would have kept company with any but men of &s;ub&s;tance." "Mrs, Bragwell," &s;aid Worthy, "If &s;he has cho&s;en a bad man, it would be &s;till a misfortune, even though he had been rich." "O that would alter the ca&s;e," &s;aid &s;he; "a <HI>fat sorrow is better than a lean one.</HI> But to marry a beggar!" Here Mi&s;s Bet|&s;ey who &s;tood &s;ullenly by, put in a word,
<PB N="7" REF="037135_0007_100C92B6844097B0">
and &s;aid, "her &s;i&s;ter, however, had not di&s;graced her&s;elf by having married a Farmer or a Trade&s;man, &s;he had at lea&s;t made choice of a Gentleman." "What marriage! what Gentleman," cried the afflicted father. "Tell me the wor&s;t!" He was now informed that his darling daughter was gone off with a &s;trolling play|er, who had been acting in the neighbour|ing villages lately. Mi&s;s Bet&s;ey again put in, &s;aying, "he was no &s;troller, but a gentleman in di&s;gui&s;e, who only acted for his own diver&s;ion," "Does he &s;o," &s;aid the now furious Bragwell, "then he &s;hall be tran&s;ported for mine. At this moment a letter was brought him from his new &s;on-in-law, who de&s;ired his leave to wait upon him, and implore his forgive|ne&s;s. He owned he had been &s;hopman to a haberda&s;her, but thinking his per&s;on and talents ought not to be thrown away upon trade, and being al&s;o a little behind hand he had taken to the &s;tage with a view of making his fortune. That he had mar|ried Mi&s;s Bragwell entirely for love, and was &s;orry to mention &s;o paltry a thing as money, which he de&s;pi&s;ed, but that his wants were pre&s;&s;ing, his landlord, to whom he was in debt, having been &s;o vulgar as
<PB N="8" REF="037135_0008_100C92B8137D2A90">
to threaten to &s;end him to pri&s;on. He ended with &s;aying, "I have been obliged to &s;hock your daughter's delicacy, by confe&s;&s;ing my unlucky real name; I be|lieve I owe part of my &s;ucce&s;s to my ha|ving a&s;&s;umed that of Augu&s;tus Frederick Theodo&s;ious. She is incon&s;olable at this confe&s;&s;ion, which, as you are now my fa|ther. I mu&s;t al&s;o make to you, and &s;ub|&s;cribe my&s;elf, with many blu&s;hes, your dutiful &s;on,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>TIMOTHY INCLE."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>"O," cried the afflicted father, as he tore the letter in a rage. "Mi&s;s Bragwell married to a &s;trolling actor! How &s;hall I bear it?" "Why, I would not bear it at all," cried the enraged mother. "I would never &s;ee her, I would never for|give her. I would let her &s;tarve at one corner of the barn, while that ra&s;cal, with all tho&s;e Pagan, popi&s;h names, was rant|ing away at the other." "Nay," &s;aid Mi&s;s Bet&s;ey, "If he is only a &s;hopman, and if his name be really Timothy Incle; I would never forgive her neither. But who would have thought it by his looks, and by his mon&s;trous genteel behaviour."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037135_0009_100C92BAB49A4348">"Come, come," &s;aid Mr. Worthy, "were he really an hone&s;t haberda&s;her, I &s;hould think there was no other harm done, except the di&s;obedience of the thing. Mr. Bragwell, this is no time to blame you, or hardly to rea&s;on with you. I feel for you &s;incerely. I ought not perhaps, ju&s;t at pre&s;ent, to reproach you for the mi&s;ta|ken manner in which you have bred up your daughters. Your error has brought its puni&s;hment along with it. You now &s;ee, becau&s;e you now feel, the evil of a fal&s;e education. It has ruined your daugh|ter, your whole plan has led to &s;ome &s;uch end. The large &s;ums you &s;pent to quali|fy them as you thought for a high &s;tation, could do them nothing but harm, while your habits of life properly confined them to company of a lower &s;tation. While they were better dre&s;t than the daughters of the fir&s;t gentry, they were wor&s;e taught than the daughters of your plowmen. Their vanity has been rai&s;ed by exce&s;&s;ive finery, and kept alive by exce&s;&s;ive flatte|ry. Every evil temper has been fo&s;tered by indulgence. Their pride has never been controled. Their &s;elf-will has ne|ver been turned. Their idlene&s;s has laid them open to every temptation, and their
<PB N="10" REF="037135_0010_100C92BCA566FF38">
abundance has enabled them to gratify every de&s;ire. Their time, that precious talent, has been entirely wa&s;ted. Every thing they have been taught to do is of no u&s;e, while they are utterly unacquainted with all which they ought to have known. I deplore Mi&s;s Polly's fal&s;e &s;tep. That &s;he &s;hould have married a run-away &s;hop|man, turned &s;troller, I truly lament. But for what hu&s;band was &s;he qualified? For the wife of a Farmer &s;he was too idle. For the wife of a trade&s;man &s;he was too expen&s;ive. For the wife of a Gentleman &s;he was too ignorant. You your&s;elf was mo&s;t to blame. You expected her to act wi&s;ely, though you never taught her that <HI>fear of God which is the beginning of wis|dom.</HI> I owe it to you, as a friend, and to my&s;elf as a Chri&s;tian to declare, that your practices in the common tran&s;actions of life, as well as your pre&s;ent misfortune, are almo&s;t the natural con&s;equences of tho&s;e fal&s;e principles, which I prote&s;ted again&s;t when you were at my* hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bragwell attempted &s;everal times to interrupt Mr. Worthy, but her hu&s;band
<PB N="11" REF="037135_0011_100C92BE3237AEB0">
would not permit it. He felt the force of all his friend &s;aid and encouraged him to proceed. Mr. Worthy thus went on. "It grieves me to &s;ay how much your own indi&s;cretion has contributed even to bring on your pre&s;ent misfortune. You gave your countenance to this very company of &s;trollers, though you knew they were acting in defiance to the laws of the land, to &s;ay no wor&s;e. They go from town to town, and barn to barn, &s;tripping the the poor of their money, the young of their innocence, and all of their time. Do you remember with how much pride you told me that you had be&s;poke <HI>The bold Stroke for a Wife,</HI> for the benefit of this very Mr. Frederic Theodo&s;ious? To this pernicious ribaldry you not only carried your own family, but wa&s;ted I know not how much money in treating your work|men's wifes and children, in the&s;e hard times too, when they have &s;carcely bread to eat or a &s;hoe on their feet. And all this only that you might have the ab&s;urd plea&s;ure of &s;eeing tho&s;e flattering words. <HI>By Desire of Mr. Bragwell,</HI> &s;tuck up in Print at the Public-hou&s;e, on the Black|&s;mith's &s;hed, at the Turnpike-gate, and on the Barn-door."</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037135_0012_100C92C025816120">Mr. Bragwell acknowledged, that his friend's rebuke was but too ju&s;t, and he looked &s;o very contrite as to rai&s;e the pi|ty of Mr. Worthy, who, in a mild voice, thus went on. "What I have &s;aid is not &s;o much to reproach you with the ruin of one daughter, as from a de&s;ire to &s;ave the other. Let Mi&s;s Bet&s;ey go home with me. I do not undertake to be her gaoler, but I will be her friend. She will find in my daughters, kind companions, and in my wife a prudent guide. I know &s;he will di&s;like us at fir&s;t, but I do not de&s;pair in time of convincing her that a &s;ober, hum|ble, u&s;eful, pious life is as nece&s;&s;ary to make us happy on earth, as it is to fit us for heaven."</P>
<P>Poor Mi&s;s Bet&s;ey, though &s;he declared it would be <HI>frightful dull,</HI> and <HI>monstrous vulgar,</HI> and <HI>dismal melancholy,</HI> yet &s;he was &s;o terrified at the di&s;content and grum|bling which &s;he would have to endure at home, that &s;he &s;ullenly con&s;ented. She had none of that filial tenderne&s;s which led her to wi&s;h to &s;tay and &s;ooth and com|fort her afflicted father. All &s;he thought about was to get out of the way of her mother's ill-humour, and to carry &s;o much
<PB N="13" REF="037135_0013_100C92C2121230B0">
finery as to fill the Mi&s;s Worthies with envy and re&s;pect. Poor girl! She did not know that envy was a feeling they never indulged: and that fine cloaths was the la&s;t thing to draw their re&s;pect. Mr. Worthy took her home next day. When they reached his hou&s;e, they found there young wil&s;on, Mi&s;s Bet&s;ey's old admirer. She was much plea&s;ed at this, and re&s;olved to treat him well. But her good or ill treatment now &s;ignified but little. This young Grazier reverenced Mr. Worthy's character, and &s;ince he had met him at the Lion, had been thinking what a happine&s;s it would be to marry a young woman bred up by &s;uch a father. He had heard much of the mode&s;ty a di&s;cretion of both the daughters, but his inclination now determined him in favour of the elder.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy, who knew him to be a young man of good &s;en&s;e and &s;ound prin|ciples, allowed him to become a vi&s;itor at his hou&s;e, but deferred his con&s;ent to the marriage till he knew him more thorough|ly. Mr. Wil&s;on, from what he &s;aw of the dome&s;tic piety of this family, impro|ved daily both in the knowledge and
<PB N="14" REF="037135_0014_100C92C465461188">
practice of religion, and Mr. Worthy &s;oon formed him into a mo&s;t valuable character. During this time Mi&s;s Brag|well's hopes had revived, but though &s;he appeared in a new dre&s;s almo&s;t every day, &s;he had the mortification of being beheld with great indifference by one whom &s;he had always &s;ecretly liked. Mr. Wil&s;on married before her face a girl who was greatly her inferior in fortune, per&s;on and appearance, but who was humble, frugal, meek and pious. Mi&s;s Bragwell now &s;trongly felt the truth of what Mr. Wil&s;on had once told her, "that a woman may make an excellent partner for a dance, who would make a very bad one for life."</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell was &s;o much afflicted at the di&s;graceful marriage of his daughter, who ran off with Timothy Incle, the &s;trolling-player, that he never fully reco|vered his &s;pirits. His chearfulne&s;s which had ari&s;en from an high opinion of him|&s;elf, had been confirmed by a con&s;tant flow of uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s; and that is a &s;ort of chearfulne&s;s which is very lia|ble to be impaired, becau&s;e it lies at the mercy of every accident and cro&s;s event in life. But though his pride was now
<PB N="15" REF="037135_0015_100C92C5F1F99440">
di&s;appointed, his misfortunes had not taught him any humility, becau&s;e he had not di&s;covered that they were cau&s;ed by his own fault; nor had he acquired any patience or &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e he had not learnt that all afflictions come from the hand of God to awaken us to a deep &s;en&s;e of our &s;ins, and to draw off our hearts from the peri&s;hing vanities of this life. Be&s;ides, Mr. Bragwell was one of tho&s;e people, who, even if they would be thought to bear with tolerable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion &s;uch trials as appear to be &s;ent more im|mediately from Providence, yet think they have a &s;ort of right to rebel at every misfortune which befalls them through the fault of a fellow-creature; as if our fellow-creatures were not the agents and in&s;tru|ments by which Providence often &s;ees fit to try or to puni&s;h us.</P>
<P>This imprudent daughter, Bragwell would not be brought to &s;ee or forgive, nor was the degrading name of Mrs. In|cle ever allowed to be pronounced in his hearing. He had loved her with an ex|ce&s;&s;ive and undue affection; and while &s;he gratified his vanity by her beauty and finery, he deemed her faults of little con|&s;equence;
<PB N="16" REF="037135_0016_100C92C7DE7FEC20">
but when &s;he di&s;appointed his ambition by a di&s;graceful marriage, all his natural affection only &s;erved to increa&s;e his re&s;entment. Yet, though he regretted her crime le&s;s than his own mortification, he never cea&s;ed in &s;ecret to lament her lo&s;s. She &s;oon found out &s;he was undone, and wrote in a &s;train of bitter repentance to a&s;k his forgivene&s;s. She owned that her hu&s;band, whom &s;he had &s;uppo&s;ed to be a man of fa&s;hion in di&s;gui&s;e, was a low per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances. She implored that her father, though he refu|&s;ed to give her hu&s;band that fortune for which alone it was now too plain he had married her, would at lea&s;t allow her &s;ome &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, for that Mr. Incle was much in debt, and &s;he feared in danger of a gaol. The father's heart was half melted at this account, and his affection was for a time awakened. But Mrs. Bragwell oppo&s;ed his &s;ending her any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She always made it a point of duty never to forgive; "for &s;he &s;aid it only encouraged tho&s;e who had done wrong once to do wor&s;e next time. For her part &s;he had never yet been guilty of &s;o mean and pitiful a weakne&s;s as to forgive any one; for to pardon an injury always &s;hewed either
<PB N="17" REF="037135_0017_100C92C9936FEBF0">
want of &s;pirit to feel it, or want of power to re&s;ent it. She was re&s;olved &s;he would never &s;quander the money for which &s;he had worked early and late, on a baggage who had thrown her&s;elf away on a beggar while &s;he had a daughter &s;ingle who might rai&s;e her family by a great match." I am &s;orry to &s;ay that Mrs. Bragwell's anger was not owing to the undutifulne&s;s of the daughter, or the worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the hu&s;|band; poverty was in her eyes the grand crime. The doctrine of forgivene&s;s, a a religious principle, made no more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> part of Mr. Bragwell's &s;y&s;tem than of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> wife's, but in natural feeling, particular<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> for this offending daughter, he much ex|ceeded her.</P>
<P>In a few months, the younge&s;t Mi&s;s Bragwell de&s;ired leave to return home from Mr. Worthy's. She had, indeed&punc; only con&s;ented to go thither as a le&s;s ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the two than &s;taying in her father'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hou&s;e after her &s;i&s;ter's elopement.

was outwardly civil, it was ea&s;y to &s;ee that &s;he longed to get away. She re&s;ol|ved, however, to profit by her &s;i&s;ter's faults; and made her parents ea&s;y by a&s;&s;uring them &s;he never would throw her|&s;elf away on a <HI>man who was worth nothing.</HI> Encouraged by the&s;e promi&s;es, which were all that her parents thought they could in rea&s;on expect, her father allow+ed her to come home.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy, who accompanied her, found Mr. Bragwell gloomy and dejected. As his hou&s;e was no longer a &s;cene of va|nity and fe&s;tivity, Mr. Bragwell tried to make him&s;elf and his friend believe that he was grown religious; whereas he was only become di&s;contented. As he had always fancied that piety was a melan|choly gloomy thing, and as he felt his own mind really gloomy, he was willing to think he was growing pious. He had, in|deed, gone more con&s;tantly to church, and had taken le&s;s plea&s;ure in fea&s;ting and cards, and now and then read a chapter in the Bible, but all this was be|cau&s;e his &s;pirits were low, and not becau&s;e his heart was changed. The outward actions were more regular, but the in|ward

man was the &s;ame. The forms of religion were re&s;orted to as a painful duty; but this only added to his mi&s;ery, while he was utterly ignorant of its &s;pirit and pow|er. He &s;till, however, re&s;erved religion as a loath&s;ome medicine, to which he feared he mu&s;t have recour&s;e at la&s;t and of which he even now con&s;idered every ab&s;tinence from plea&s;ure, or every exerci&s;e of piety as a bitter do&s;e. His health al&s;o was im|paired, &s;o that his friend found him in a pitiable &s;tate, neither able to receive plea&s;ure from the world, which he &s;o dear|ly loved, nor from religion which he &s;o greatly feared. He expected to have been much commended by Worthy for the change in his way of life; but Worthy, who &s;aw that the alteration was only ow|ing to the lo&s;s of animal &s;pirits, and to the ca&s;ual ab&s;ence of temptation, was cautious of flattering him too much. "I thought, Mr. Worthy," &s;aid he, "to have received more comfort from you. I was told too, that religion was full of com|fort, but I do not find much in it." You were told the truth, replied Worthy, Re|ligion is full of comfort, but you mu&s;t fir&s;t be brought into a &s;tate fit to receive it be|fore it can become &s;o; you mu&s;t be brought

to a deep and humbling &s;en&s;e of &s;in. To give you comfort while you are puffed up with high thoughts of your&s;elf, would be to give you a &s;trong cordial in a high fever. Religion keeps back her cordials till the patient is lowered and emptied; emptied of &s;elf, Mr. Bragwell. If you had a wound, it mu&s;t be examined and clean|&s;ed, aye, and probed too, before it would be &s;afe to put on a healing plai&s;ter. Cu|ring it to the outward eye, while it was corrupt at bottom, would only bring on a mortification, and you would be a dead man while you tru&s;ted that the plai&s;|ter was curing you. You mu&s;t be, indeed, a Chri&s;tian, before you can be entitled to the comforts of Chri&s;tianity.&mdash;I am a Chri&s;tian, &s;aid Bragwell, many of my friends are Chri&s;tians, but I do not &s;ee it has done us much good.&mdash;Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, an&s;wered Worthy, cannot make us good unle&s;s it be applied to our hearts. Chri&s;tian privileges will not make us Chri&s;tians unle&s;s we make u&s;e of them. On that &s;helf I &s;ee &s;tands your medicine. The doctor orders you to take it. "<HI>Have</HI> you taken it?"&mdash;Yes, replied Bragwell. Are you the better for it? &s;aid Worthy. &mdash;I think I am, he replied.&mdash;But, added
<PB N="21" REF="037135_0021_100C92D21D1DBC40">
Worthy, are you the better becau&s;e the doctor has ordered it merely, or becau&s;e you have al&s;o taken it?&mdash;What a fooli&s;h que&s;tion, cried Bragwell. Why to be &s;ure the doctor might be the be&s;t doctor, and his phy&s;ic the be&s;t phy&s;ic in the world; but if it &s;tood forever on the &s;helf, I could not expect to be cured by it. My doctor is not a mountebank. He does not pre|tend to cure by a charm. The phy&s;ic is good, and as it &s;uits my ca&s;e, though it is bitter, I take it.&mdash;You have now, &s;aid Worthy, explained unde&s;ignedly the rea|&s;on why Religion does &s;o little good in the world. It is not a mountebank; it does not work by a charm; but offers to cure your wor&s;t corruptions by whole&s;ome, though &s;ometimes bitter pre&s;criptions. But you will not take them; you will not apply to God with the &s;ame earne&s;t de&s;ire to be healed with which you apply to your doctor; you will not confe&s;s your &s;ins to the one as hone&s;tly as you tell your &s;ymptoms to the other, nor read your Bible with the &s;ame faith and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion with which you take your medicine. In reading it, however, you mu&s;t take care not to apply to your&s;elf the comforts which are not &s;uited to your ca&s;e. You mu&s;t, by
<PB N="22" REF="037135_0022_100C92D40BA268A8">
the grace of God, be brought into a con|dition to be entitled to the promi&s;es, be|fore you can expect the comfort of them. Conviction is not conver&s;ion; that world|ly di&s;content which is the effect of world|ly di&s;appointment, is not that <HI>godly sorrow which worketh repentance.</HI> Be&s;ides, while you have been pur&s;uing all the gratifica|tions of the world, do not complain that you have not all the comforts of Religion too. Could you live in the full enjoy|ment of both, <HI>the Bible would not be true.</HI></P>
<P>Bragwell now &s;eemed re&s;olved to &s;et about the matter in earne&s;t, but he re&s;ol|ved in his own &s;trength; and, unluckily, the very day Mr. Worthy took leave, there happened to be a grand ball at the next town, on account of the a&s;&s;izes. An a&s;&s;ize-ball is a &s;cene to which gentleman and ladies periodically re&s;ort to celebrate the crimes and calamities of their fellow-creatures by dancing and mu&s;ic, and to divert them&s;elves with fea&s;ting and drink|ing, while unhappy wretches are receiv|ing &s;entence of death.</P>
<P>To this ball Mi&s;s Bragwell went, dre&s;&s;|ed out with a double portion of finery,
<PB N="23" REF="037135_0023_100C92D5978FB530">
pouring out on her own head the whole band-box of feathers and flowers her &s;i&s;ter had left behind her. While &s;he was at the ball her father formed many plans of religious reformation; he talked of le&s;|&s;&s;ening his bu&s;ine&s;s, that he might have more lei&s;ure for devotion; though not <HI>just now,</HI> while the markets were &s;o high; and then he began to think of &s;end|ing a hand&s;ome &s;ub&s;cription to the infir|mary; though, on &s;econd thoughts, he concluded he need not be <HI>in a hurry,</HI> but leave it in his will, but to give, and repent, and reform, were three things he was bent upon. But when his daugh|ter came home at night, &s;o happy and &s;o fine, and telling how &s;he had danced with Squire Squeeze the great corn contractor, and how many fine things he had &s;aid to her, Mr. Bragwell felt the old &s;pirit of the world return in its full force. A mar|riage with Mr. Da&s;hall Squeeze, the con|tractor, was beyond his hopes, for Mr. Squeeze was &s;uppo&s;ed from a very low beginning to have got rich during the war. As for Mr. Squeeze he had picked up as much of the hi&s;tory of his partner between the dances as he de&s;ired, he was convin|ced there would be no money wanting, for Mi&s;s Bragwell, who was now looked
<PB N="24" REF="037135_0024_100C92D7C4DA4B58">
on as an only child, mu&s;t needs be a great fortune, and he was too much u&s;ed to advantageous contracts to let this &s;lip. As he was gaudily dre&s;&s;ed, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the arts of vulgar flattery, Mi&s;s Bragwell eagerly caught at his propo&s;al to wait on her father next day. Squeeze was quite a man after Bragwell's own heart, a geni|us at getting money, a fine da&s;hing fel|low at &s;pending it. He told his wife that this was the very &s;ort of man for his daugh|ter, for he got money like a Jew and &s;pent it like a prince; but whether it was fair|ly got, or wi&s;ely &s;pent, he was too much a man of the world to inquire. Mrs. Bragwell was not &s;o run away with by appearances, but &s;he de&s;ired her hu&s;band to be careful and quite &s;ure that it was the right Mr. Squeeze, and no impo&s;tor. But being a&s;&s;ured that Bet&s;ey would cer|tainly keep her carriage, &s;he never gave her&s;elf one thought with what &s;ort of a man &s;he was to ride in it. To have one of her daughters drive in her own coach, filled up all her ideas of human happine&s;s. The marriage was celebrated with great &s;plendor, and Mr. and Mrs. Squeeze &s;et off for London, where they had a hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="037135_0025_100C92D9AF25B3C0">Mr. Bragwell now tried to forget that he had any other daughter, and if &s;ome thoughts of the re&s;olutions he had made of entering on a more religious cour&s;e would &s;ometimes force them&s;elves upon him, they were put off, like the repentance of Felix, <HI>to a more convenient season,</HI> and finding he was likely to have a grandchild, he became more worldly and ambitious than ever, thinking this a ju&s;t pretence for adding hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and field to field; and there is no &s;tratagem by which men more deceive them&s;elves than when they make even unborn children a pre+tence for that rapine, or that hoarding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which their own covetou&s;ne&s;s is the true motive.

Bragwell was &s;taggered, and refu&s;ed to comply; but his wife told him he mu&s;t not be &s;habby to &s;uch a gentleman as Squire Squeeze, for that &s;he heard on all &s;ides &s;uch accounts of their grandeur, their fea&s;ts, their carri|ages, and their liveries, that &s;he and her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;band ought even to deny them&s;elves comforts to oblige &s;uch a generous &s;on, who did all this in honour of their daugh|ter; be&s;ides, if he did not &s;end the money &s;oon, they might be obliged to lay down their coach, and then &s;he &s;hould never be able to &s;hew her face again.

This was impo&s;&s;ible, he had not only &s;pent his large income without making any provi&s;ion for his family, but had contracted heavy debts by gaining and other vices.

The&s;e repeated demands made Bragwell &s;o unea&s;y, that in&s;tead of &s;ending him the money, he re|&s;olved to go him&s;elf &s;ecretly to London, and judge by his own eyes how things were going on, as his mind &s;trangely mi&s;|gave him.

In about a week, Mrs. Squeeze lay-in of a dead child, &s;he her&s;elf langui&s;h|ed a few days and then died; and the afflicted parents &s;aw the two darling ob|jects of their ambition, for who&s;e &s;akes they had made <HI>too much haste to be rich,</HI> carried to the land where all things are forgotten. Mrs. Bragwell's grief, like her other pa&s;&s;ions was extravagant; and poor Bragwell's &s;orrow was rendered &s;o

bitter by &s;elf-reproach, that he would quite have &s;unk under it, had he not thought of his old expedient in di&s;tre&s;s, that of &s;ending for Mr. Worthy to com|fort him. It was Mr. Worthy's way, to warn people of tho&s;e misfortunes which he &s;aw their faults mu&s;t needs bring on them, but not to reproach, or de&s;ert them when the misfortunes came. He had ne|ver been near Bragwell, during the &s;hort, but flouri&s;hing reign of the Squeezes; for he knew that pro&s;perity made the ears deaf, and the heart hard to good coun&s;el; but as &s;oon as he heard his friend was in trouble he &s;et out to go to him. Bragwell bur&s;t into a violent fit of tears when he &s;aw him, and when he could &s;peak, &s;aid, This trial is more than I can bear. Mr. Worthy kindly took him by the hand, and when he was a little compo&s;ed, &s;aid, I will tell you a &s;hort &s;tory. There was in ancient times a famous man who was a &s;lave. His ma&s;ter, who was very good to him, one day gave him a bitter melon, and bade him eat it; he eat it up without one word of complaint. How was it po&s;&s;i|ble, &s;aid the ma&s;ter, for you to eat &s;o ve|ry nau&s;eous and di&s;agreeable a fruit? The &s;lave replied, My good ma&s;ter, I have

received &s;o many favours from your boun|ty, that it is no wonder if I &s;hould once in my life eat one bitter melon from your hands. This generous an&s;wer &s;o &s;truck the ma&s;ter, that the hi&s;tory, &s;ays he, gave him his liberty. With &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;entiments, my friend, &s;hould man re|ceive his portion of &s;ufferings from God, from whom he receives &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings. You in particular have received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch good at the hand of God, &s;hall not you receive evil al&s;o?</P>
