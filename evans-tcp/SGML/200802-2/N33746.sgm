<HEAD>THE SPEECH of his Excellency JOHN RUTLEDGE, ESQUIRE, Governor and Commander in Chief of the State of SOUTH-CAROLINA, to the GENERAL ASSEMBLY, met at Jack&s;on|burgh, on Friday the 16th Day of January, 1782.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honorable Gentlemen of the Senate, Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE the la&s;t meeting of a General A&s;&s;embly, the good People of this State have not only felt the common Calamities of War, but, from the wanton and &s;avage Manner in which it has been pro&s;ecuted, they have experienced &s;uch Severities as are unpracti&s;ed, and will &s;carcely be credited by civilized Nations.</P>
<P>THE Enemy, unable to make any impre&s;&s;ion on the Northern States, the Number of who&s;e Inhabitants, and the &s;trength of who&s;e Country, had baffled their repeated Efforts, turned their Views to|wards the Southern, which, a difference of Circum&s;tances afforded &s;ome Expectation of conquering, or at lea&s;t of greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing.&mdash; After a long Re&s;i&s;tance, the Reduction of Charles Town was effected, by the va&s;t &s;uperiority of Force with which it had been be&s;ieged.&mdash; The lo&s;s of that Garri&s;on, as it con&s;i&s;ted of the Continental Troops of Virginia and the Carolinas, and of a number of Militia, facilitated the Enemy's march into the Country, and their E&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;trong Po&s;ts, in the upper and interior Parts of it; And, the unfavou|rable I&s;&s;ue of the Action near Camden, induced them vainly to ima|gine, that no other Army could be collected, which they might not ea&s;ily defeat.&mdash;The Militia, commanded by the Brigadiers Sumpter and Ma&s;ion, who&s;e enterpri&s;ing Spirit and unremitted Per&s;everance under many difficulties, are de&s;erving of great Applau&s;e, harra&s;&s;ed and often defeated large Parties, but, the Numbers of tho&s;e Militia were too few to contend effectually with the collected Strength of the Enemy&mdash;Regardle&s;s therefore of the &s;acred <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of Honor, de&s;titute

of the Feelings of Humanity, and determined to extingui&s;h, if po&s;|&s;ible, every Spark of Freedom in this Country, They, with the in&s;olent Pride of Conquerors, gave unbounded &s;cope to the Exerci&s;e of their Tyrannical di&s;po&s;ition, infringed their public Engagements, and vio|lated the mo&s;t &s;olemn Capitulations&mdash;many of our worthie&s;t Citizens, were, without cau&s;e, long, and clo&s;ely confined&mdash;&s;ome on Board of Pri&s;on Ships, and others in the Town and Ca&s;tle of St. Augu&s;tine &mdash;their Properties di&s;po&s;ed of, at the Will and Caprice of the Ene|my, and their Families &s;ent to a different and di&s;tant Part of the Con|tinent, without the Means of Support&mdash;many who had &s;urrendered as Pri&s;oners of War were killed in cold Blood, &s;everal &s;uffered Death in the mo&s;t ignominious Manner, and others were delivered up to Savages, and put to Tortures, under which they expired&mdash;Thus, the Lives, Liberties and Properties of the People were dependent, &s;olely, on the plea&s;ure of Briti&s;h Officers, who deprived them of Either or all, on the mo&s;t frivolous Pretences&mdash;Indians, Slaves and a de&s;pe|rate Banditti of the mo&s;t profligate Characters, were care&s;&s;ed and employed by the Enemy to execute their infamous Purpo&s;es&mdash;De|va&s;tation and Ruin marked their Progre&s;s, and that of their Adhe|rents, nor were their Violences re&s;trained by the Charms or Influence of Beauty and Innocence&mdash;Even the fair Sex, whom it is the duty of all, and the plea&s;ure and pride of the Brave, to protect,&mdash;they, and their tender Off&s;pring, were Victims to the inveterate Malice of an unrelenting Foe&mdash;neither the Tears of Mothers, nor the Cries of In|fants, could excite, in their Brea&s;ts, Pity or Compa&s;&s;ion&mdash;not only the peaceful Habitations of the Widow, the aged, and the infirm, but, the holy Temples of the mo&s;t High were con&s;umed, in Flames, kindled by their &s;acrilegious Hands&mdash;They have tarni&s;hed the Glory of the Briti&s;h Arms, di&s;graced the Profe&s;&s;ion of a Briti&s;h Soldier, and

<P>I al&s;o mo&s;t heartily congratulate you, on the glorious Victory ob|tained by the combined Forces of America and France, over their common Enemy&mdash; when the very General, who was &s;econd in Com|mand at the Reduction of Charles Town, and to who&s;e boa&s;ted Prowe&s;s, and highly extolled Abilities, the Conque&s;t of no le&s;s than three States had been arrogantly committed, was &s;peedily compelled, to accept of the &s;ame mortifying Terms, which had been impo&s;ed on that brave but unfortunate Garri&s;on; to &s;urrender an Army of many thou&s;and Regulars, and to abandon his wretched followers, whom he had artfully &s;educed from their Allegiance, by &s;pecious Promi&s;es of Protection, which he could never have hoped to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to the Ju&s;tice or Mercy of their Country&mdash;on the naval Superiority e&s;tabli&s;hed by the illu&s;trious Ally of the United States&mdash;a Superiority

in it&s;elf &s;o decided, and in its Con&s;equences &s;o exten&s;ive, as mu&s;t ine|vitably &s;oon oblige the Enemy to yield, to Us, the only Po&s;t which they occupy in this State&mdash;on the reiterated Proofs of the &s;incere&s;t Friend&s;hip, and on the great Support, which America has received from that powerful Monarch&mdash;a Monarch who&s;e Magnanimity is univer&s;ally acknowledged and admired, and, on who&s;e Royal Word, We may confidently rely, for every nece&s;&s;ary A&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;on the perfect Harmony which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between France and America&mdash;on the Stability which her Independence has acquired, and, on the Certainty that it is too deeply rooted, ever to be &s;haken&mdash;for, ani|mated as they are, by National Honor, and united by one common Intere&s;t, it mu&s;t and will be maintained.</P>
<P>WHAT may be the immediate Effects, on the Briti&s;h Nation, of the Events which I have mentioned, of their Lo&s;s of Territory in other parts of the World, and, of their well &s;ounded Apprehen&s;ions from the powers of France, Spain and Holland, it is impo&s;&s;ible to foretell&mdash;If Experience can teach Wi&s;dom, to a haughty and infa|tuated People, and, if they will now be governed by Rea&s;on, they will have learnt, that they can have no &s;olid Ground of Hope, to conquer any State in the Union, for, tho' their Armies have obtained temporary Advantages over our Troops, yet the Citizens of the&s;e States, firmly re&s;olved, as they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> return to a Domination which, near &s;ix Years ago, they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and ju&s;tly renounced, cannot be &s;ubdued&mdash;and, They mu&s;t now be convinced, that it is the Height of Folly and Madne&s;s to per&s;i&s;t in &s;o ruinous a War&mdash;If, however, We judge, as We ought, of their future by their pa&s;t Con|duct, We may pre&s;ume, that they will, not only endeavour to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our Capital, but make another Attempt, how&s;oever im|probable
<PB N="5" REF="044266_0005_101DE27CF4A85CA8">
the Succe&s;s of it may appear, to &s;ubjugate this Country&mdash; It is therefore highly incumbent on Us, to u&s;e our mo&s;t &s;trenuous Efforts, to fru&s;trate &s;o fatal a De&s;ign, And, I earne&s;tly conjure you, by the Duty which you owe, and the &s;acred Love which you bear, to your Country, by the con&s;tant Remembrance of her bitter Suffer|ings, and by the ju&s;t Dete&s;tation of Briti&s;h Government, which you and your Po&s;terity, mu&s;t for Ever, po&s;&s;e&s;s, to exert your utmo&s;t Fa|culties, for that purpo&s;e, by rai&s;ing and equipping, with all po&s;&s;ible Expedition, a re&s;pectable permanent Force, and by making ample Provi&s;ion for their comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tence&mdash;I am &s;en&s;ible the Ex|pence will be great, but, a Mea&s;ure &s;o indi&s;pen&s;able to the pre&s;erva|tion of our Freedom, is above every pecuniary Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>THE Organization of our Militia is likewi&s;e a Subject of infinite Importance&mdash;a clear and conci&s;e Law, by which the Burdens of Ser|vice will be equally &s;u&s;tained, and a competent Number of Men brought forth, and kept in the Field, when their A&s;&s;i&s;tance may be required, is e&s;&s;ential to our Security, and therefore, ju&s;tly claims your immediate and &s;erious Attention&mdash;Certain it is, that &s;ome of our Militia have, upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions, exhibited In&s;tances of Valour which would have reflected Honor on veteran Troops&mdash;The Cou|rage and Conduct of the Generals whom I have mentioned, the cool and determined Bravery repeatedly di&s;played by Brigadier Pickens, and, indeed, the Behaviour of many Officers and Men in every Bri|gade, are unque&s;tionable Te&s;timonies of the Truth of this A&s;&s;ertion &mdash;But, &s;uch Behaviour cannot be expected from Militia in General, without good order and &s;trict di&s;cipline, nor can that order and di&s;|cipline be e&s;tabli&s;hed, but by a &s;alutary Law, &s;teadily executed.</P>
<P>ANOTHER important Matter for your Deliberation, is the Con|duct of &s;uch of our Citizens as voluntarily avowing their Allegiance,
<PB N="6" REF="044266_0006_101DE2816C2335A8">
and even glorying in their pro&s;e&s;&s;ions of Loyalty and Attachment to his Britannick Maje&s;ty, have offered their Congratulations on the Succe&s;s of his Arms, prayed to be embodied as Royal Militia, ac|cepted Commi&s;&s;ions in his Service, or, endeavoured to &s;ubvert our Con&s;titution, and e&s;tabli&s;h his power, in its &s;tead, of tho&s;e who have returned to this State, in Defiance of a Law by which &s;uch return was declared to be a Capital Offence, and have abetted the Briti&s;h Intere&s;t; and of &s;uch, who&s;e Behaviour has been &s;o reprehen&s;ible, that Ju&s;tice and Policy forbid their free Re-admi&s;&s;ion to the Rights and Privileges of Citizens.</P>
<P>THE extraordinary Lenity of this State, has been remarkably con|&s;picuous&mdash;other States have thought it ju&s;t and expedient to appro|priate the Property of Briti&s;h Subjects to the public U&s;e, But, We have forborne to take even the Profits of the E&s;tates of our mo&s;t im|placable Enemies&mdash;It is with you to determine, whether the For|feiture and Appropriation of their Property &s;hould now take Place &mdash;If &s;uch &s;hall be your Determination, tho', many of our firme&s;t Friends have been reduced, for their inflexible Attachment to the Cau&s;e of their Country, from Opulence to inconceivable Di&s;tre&s;s, and, if the Enemy's Will and Power had prevailed, would have been doomed to Indigence and Beggary, yet it will redound to the Repu|tation of this State, to provide a becoming Support, for the Families of tho&s;e whom you may deprive of their Property.</P>
<P>THE Value of Paper Currency became, of late, &s;o much depreci|ated, that it was requi&s;ite, under the Powers ve&s;ted in the Executive during the Rece&s;s of the General A&s;&s;embly, to &s;u&s;pend the Laws by which it was made a Tender&mdash;You will now con&s;ider whether it may not be proper to repeal tho&s;e Laws, and fix &s;ome equitable Mode, for the di&s;charge of Debts, contracted whil&s;t Paper Money was in Circulation.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="044266_0007_101DE2830C7E49B8">IN the pre&s;ent Scarcity of Specie, it would be difficult, if not im|practicable, to levy a Tax, to any con&s;iderable Amount, towards &s;inking the public Debt, nor will the Creditors of the State expect that &s;uch a Tax &s;hould, at this Time, be impo&s;ed; But, it is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, that all un&s;ettled Demands &s;hould be liquidated, and &s;atisfactory A&s;&s;urances of Payment given, to the public Creditors.</P>
<P>THE Intere&s;t and Honor, the Safety and Happine&s;s of our Coun|try depend, &s;o much, on the Re&s;ult of your Deliberations, that I flatter my&s;elf you will proceed, in the weighty Bu&s;ine&s;s before you, with Firmne&s;s and Temper, with Vigour, Unanimity and Di&s;patch.</P>
