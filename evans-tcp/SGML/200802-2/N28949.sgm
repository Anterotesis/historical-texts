<BIBL>II CHRON. XXXII. 33.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And Hezekiah &s;lept with his fathers, and they buried him in the Chiefe&s;t of the &s;epulchres of the &s;ons of David; and all Judah, and the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem did him honour at his death: And Mana&s;&s;eh his &s;on reigned in his &s;tead.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HEZEKIAH was a mo&s;t virtuous and pious king of Judah, of whom this te&s;ti|mony is given by in&s;piration, that he &s;ought the Lord with all his heart. In him we &s;ee a &s;triking in|&s;tance of what the energy of a &s;ingle character, aided and &s;upported by a kind Providence, could do, towards re|trieving the depre&s;&s;ed and deranged &s;tate of a kingdom or nation. He came to the throne at a time when both the religious and political &s;tate of his kingdom were in the greate&s;t di&s;order, and deepe&s;t depre&s;&s;ion; occa&s;ioned by the wicked and impolitic conduct of his predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Ahaz, his father, was a mon&s;ter of folly and impiety, and his affairs were proportionably unpro&s;perous. The Jewi&s;h religion was &s;o interwoven with their civil con|&s;titution, that any attempt to change it, either by prince or people, was trea&s;on again&s;t the commonwealth, as
<PB N="4" REF="038599_0003_101231E5D2DC0C78">
well as impiety towards God. Ahaz attempted to abol|i&s;h the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip, and actually introduced and patronized the idolatrous rites of the heathen nations by whom Judah was &s;urrounded. Hereby he lo&s;t the hearts of his be&s;t &s;ubjects, and forfeited the protection of heaven. The Syrians of Dama&s;cus &s;mote him, and carried many of his people captive; as did likewi&s;e the king of I&s;rael, who &s;lew them in a rage that reached up to heaven, even one hundred and twenty thou&s;and in one day. And al|though he lavi&s;hed both his own trea&s;ures, the trea&s;ures of the hou&s;e of the Lord, and the trea&s;ures of the princes, upon Tilgath-pilne&s;er, king of A&s;&s;yria, (then the mo&s;t powerful monarch in the world,) he only di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him, but helped him not. In the time of his afflictions his im|piety increa&s;ed; he tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed the more again&s;t the Lord. This is recorded by in&s;piration with a note of infamy. "This is that king Ahaz." And, proportionably, as he became impious and unpro&s;perous, he became con|temptible in the eyes of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>When the kingdom was in this &s;tate of religious and political di&s;order and debility, Hezekiah, a mo&s;t worthy &s;on of a wretched father, mounted the throne. He im|mediately &s;et him&s;elf, in earne&s;t, to remedy the evils oc|ca&s;ioned by the weakne&s;s and wickedne&s;s of his prede|ce&s;&s;or. One of the fir&s;t works of his reign was to open, purify, and repair the hou&s;e of God, which had been de|faced, de&s;erted, and &s;hut up, during the impious reign of Ahaz; as well as to de&s;troy idolatry, and re&s;tore the true wor&s;hip of God in every part of his dominions. But, though his heart was much engaged in the reformation of religion, he was by no means inattentive either to the political intere&s;ts of his kingdom, or to the means of in|crea&s;ing and drawing forth the internal re&s;ources thereof, for the purpo&s;es of defence. He repaired the fenced cities of Judah, and put arms and garri&s;ons in them; and after he had, in a good mea&s;ure, &s;trengthened his Kingdom, he threw off the inglorious A&s;&s;yrian yoke, to
<PB N="5" REF="038599_0004_10123355ADDE6E80">
which Ahaz his father had &s;ubmitted: And, although he was un&s;ucce&s;sful in &s;ome encounters with the A&s;&s;yri|ans, when they fir&s;t invaded the land, and &s;everal of the fenced cities of Judah fell into the enemy's hands, yet, in the i&s;&s;ue, (through a very &s;ignal interpo&s;ition of provi|dence in his favour,) he was completely victorious. And before his death, the kingdom of Judah was ad|vanced to a very high pitch of pro&s;perity. His many private virtues, as well as his righteous and &s;ucce&s;sful admini&s;tration of the affairs of the kingdom, endeared him very much to the nation in his life, and at his death his people were di&s;po&s;ed to confer every honor upon his memory, to which a man, who had de&s;erved eminently well of his country, could be entitled. Such was the man to whom all Judah, and the inhabitants of Jeru&s;a|lem, did honour at his death; having, doubtle&s;s, previ|ou&s;ly honoured him in his life.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not, in this di&s;cour&s;e, confine my&s;elf to the u&s;ual formality of a &s;ermon. This pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred hi&s;tory, however, furni&s;hes us with an ob&s;ervation, which I &s;hall keep in view in what follows: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That when men of extraordinary gifts, talents, and u&s;efulne&s;s, particularly, rulers who have been in the mo&s;t eminent &s;tations in a nation, have filled them with dig|nity, and have been eminent ble&s;&s;ings to their country, come to die, the be&s;towing extraordinary honours upon, as well as making more than u&s;ual lamentation for them, is a cu&s;tom which hath, more or le&s;s, obtained among all nations; and, when kept within due bounds, is op|po&s;ed by no principle either of rea&s;on or revelation.</P>
<P>However the cu&s;tom may be liable to abu&s;es, and, doubtle&s;s, has in many in&s;tances been abu&s;ed, yet, when duly regulated, it is not only lawful, but laudable, and the more exten&s;ive a per&s;on's &s;phere of u&s;efulne&s;s has been, the more widely extended will be the honours done him at his death.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="038599_0005_101233585DEF9EB8">
In&s;tead of, at this time, attempting to range the wide field of profane hi&s;tory for illu&s;tration, I &s;hall barely &s;e|lect two or three in&s;tances from the pages of in&s;piration.</P>
<P>When the patriarch Jacob died in Egypt, and was carried, for interment, into the land of Canaan, great lamentation was made for him, and he was honoured with a &s;umptuous and expen&s;ive funeral. When Mo&s;es, who had delivered the children of I&s;rael out of Egypt, and led them, forty years, through the wilderne&s;s to|wards Canaan, died on the mount, all I&s;rael mourned for him thirty days. When Samuel the prophet died, who had been &s;uch a &s;ingular ble&s;&s;ing in his day, all I&s;|rael lamented him, and buried him. When A&s;a, a vir|tuous king of Judah, died, they laid him in a bed which was filled with &s;weet odours, and divers kinds of &s;pices, prepared by the apothecaries art; and they made a very great burning for him. In like manner good Hezekiah was honoured. And when godly Jo&s;iah was untimeou&s;ly &s;lain at Megiddo, <Q>all Judah and Jeru&s;alem mourned for Jo&s;iah. And all the &s;inging men, and &s;inging women, &s;pake of Jo&s;iah in their lamentations unto this day, and they made them an ordinance in I&s;rael; and behold they are written in the book of the lamenta|tions.</Q> Many of tho&s;e inimitably beautiful, and pathetic &s;trains of &s;orrow, recorded in the book of the lamenta|tions, have, without doubt, a reference to the death of that pious and excellent prince.</P>
<P>Now there is no mark of di&s;approbation put upon the extraordinary re&s;pect &s;hewn, either to Hezekiah, or others at their death. But, on the other hand, the want of a decent, or even honourable attention at death, is threatened as a calamity, and a cur&s;e, particularly upon Jehoiakim, the &s;on of Jo&s;iah.&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JER. XXII. 18, 19.</NOTE> <Q>Therefore, thus &s;aith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim the &s;on of Jo&s;iah, they &s;hall not lament for him &s;aying, Ah my brother,
<PB N="7" REF="038599_0006_1012335AE84203D8">
or, Ah my &s;i&s;ter. They &s;hall not lament for him &s;ay|ing, Ah Lord, or, Ah his glory. He &s;hall be buried with the burial of an a&s;s, drawn, and ca&s;t forth beyond the gates of Jeru&s;alem.</Q></P>
<P>In our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, the que&s;tion will now be, If we &s;uppo&s;e it nece&s;&s;ary, or even allowable for all the in|habitants of a country, to do honour to the memory of a great and &s;ignal benefactor at his death, how is it to be done?</P>
<P>I &s;hall, for a very few moments, detain you on this que&s;tion, and then proceed to &s;uch ob&s;ervations as are more immediately &s;ugge&s;ted by the occa&s;ion upon which, not only this large a&s;&s;embly, but many others through|out the United States, are collected together.</P>
<P>And rea&s;on, as well as cu&s;tom and experience teaches us, that peculiarly eminent and u&s;eful men, are to be honoured at their death, by a funeral more &s;umptuous, and even more expen&s;ive than u&s;ual. Though this can be no advantage to the dead, it is but a proper te&s;timo|ny of the re&s;pect which the living bear to their memory. Thus Jo&s;eph &s;pared no expen&s;e at his father's funeral, but engaged phy&s;icians to embalm the aged patriarch.</P>
<P>It is rea&s;onable al&s;o to honour great and eminent men, by making a more than ordinary public lamentation for them. As the lo&s;s which a country &s;u&s;tains, when &s;uch eminent characters are taken away, is truly great, and mu&s;t be exten&s;ively felt, it is but rea&s;onable that a &s;en|&s;ibility of it &s;hould be proportionably expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>We are moreover to honour great and u&s;eful men at their death, by taking &s;uitable notice of the great things they have done, and by giving even &s;uch a particular detail of their eminent &s;ervices, as would be inconveni|ent during their lives. When Tabitha, otherwi&s;e called Dorcas, died, all the widows, and &s;uch as had been re|lieved by her beneficence, &s;tood by her weeping, and &s;hewing the coats and garments Dorcas made while &s;he was with them. So, when any very dear friend is ab|&s;ent,
<PB N="8" REF="038599_0007_1012335CAD26A3B8">
more e&s;pecially, if he is gone to that bourne from whence no traveller returns, it is natural for &s;urviv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> to dwell with plea&s;ure, even upon every minute circum|&s;tance which has a tendency to endear his memory. With much greater rea&s;on ought a grateful people to re|count the &s;ignal &s;ervices done by one who has been an eminent benefactor, and even a father to his country; and hath led them by the hand through the &s;torms of a revolution, to the haven of peace and political &s;ecurity; when he him&s;elf is now no more. Truth is to be our guide, and we are not to a&s;cribe to men, qualifications they did not po&s;&s;es, but ju&s;t commendations are not to be withheld, whether it be in &s;et orations, or at other times when their names are mentioned.</P>
<P>Nor, in honouring &s;ignally great and u&s;eful men at their deaths, is that Providence which hath rai&s;ed them up, and made them what they were, to be overlooked. Man can never be more honoured, than when he is con|&s;idered as a di&s;tingui&s;hed in&s;trument for carrying on &s;ome important purpo&s;e of Providence, for the welfare and happine&s;s of mankind. That God does rai&s;e up, and qualify men for eminent &s;tations, is a point to which revelation gives te&s;timony.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PROV. VIII. 15, 16.</NOTE><Q>By me kings reign, and princes decree judgment. By me princes rule, and nobles; even all the judges of the earth.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">PSAL. LXXV. 6, 7.</NOTE>Pro|motion cometh neither from the ea&s;t, nor from the we&s;t, but God is the judge him&s;elf, he rai&s;eth up one, and putteth down another.</Q> Providence furni&s;heth &s;uch in&s;truments with qualifications, &s;uited to the &s;ta|tions in which they are placed. David a&s;cribes his &s;kill in war to this &s;ource. <Q>Thou art he who teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight. A bow of &s;teel is broken by mine arms.</Q> He furni&s;heth judges for the bench, generals for the field, and princes to &s;way the &s;ceptre. He is a &s;pirit of judgment to tho&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="038599_0008_1012335F424F1C38">
who &s;it in judgment, and &s;trength to tho&s;e who turn the battle to the gates. Thus Mo&s;es was rai&s;ed up for a deliverer, to re&s;cue the children of I&s;rael out of their Egyptian bondage, as well as for a lawgiver, and leader to guide them through the wilderne&s;s; Jo&s;hua was rai&s;|ed up as a general, to conduct them into the promi&s;ed land; and the judges and prophets were rai&s;ed up and qualified for the particular &s;ervices a&s;&s;igned them. Da|vid was al&s;o, by a wonderful train of providences, taken from the &s;heepfold and rai&s;ed up, &s;tep by &s;tep, until he became the captain of the Lord's people. I &s;hall only &s;elect one in&s;tance more from the &s;acred records; and that not of one who was a profe&s;&s;or of the true religion. I mean Cyrus, king of Per&s;ia, who, be&s;ides being other|wi&s;e concerned in bringing about the general plan of Providence, was an in&s;trument in God's hand, in I&s;rael's return out of the Babyloni&s;h captivity. Of him, hon|ourable mention is made by the prophet long before he was born.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. XLIV, 26.</NOTE><Q>That &s;aith of Cyrus he is my &s;hepherd, and &s;hall do all my plea&s;ure, &s;aying to Jeru&s;alem thou &s;halt be built, and to the temple, thy foundation &s;hall be laid.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. XLV, 1</NOTE>Thus &s;aith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, who&s;e right hand I have holden, to &s;ubdue nations before him.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 4.</NOTE>I have even called thee by thy name, and &s;irnamed thee, tho thou ha&s;t not known me.</Q> The &s;ame Providence is ever watchful &s;till, of which in&s;tances might ea&s;ily be multiplied; taken both from more ancient and more modern times. But pa&s;&s;ing others: Was not the interpo&s;ition of Prov|idence exceedingly vi&s;ible, in rai&s;ing up our lately be|loved, but now &s;incerely regretted, and lamented WASHINGTON, and in qualifying him, in a re|markable manner, for his work, as well as in a&s;&s;i&s;ting, and pro&s;pering him in it, &s;o as to cau&s;e it to be event|ually
<PB N="10" REF="038599_0009_1012336380DE3E88">
crowned with &s;ucce&s;s? No greater re&s;pect there|fore, can be paid to his memory, no greater honour can be done him at his death, than by a&s;cribing the glory of all he was and did, to that Providence by which he was rai&s;ed up.</P>
<P>Great and wi&s;e State&s;men and Patriots are to be hon|oured at their death, by continuing to imitate their ex|ample, and to copy after, and practice the wi&s;e maxims of their admini&s;tration. There is no part of the honour which is ju&s;tly due to decea&s;ed worthies, who have de|&s;erved well of their country, that is &s;o &s;eldom rendered, and the performance of which is attended with &s;o much difficulty as this. We may &s;hed many tears, we may form funeral proce&s;&s;ions, we may bury their remains with Ma&s;onic, with Military, with Chri&s;tian, and even with princely honours, or with every honour &s;hort of that which is divine; we may compo&s;e funeral dirges, and extoll their prai&s;es to the clouds in &s;et orations; we may a&s;cribe to them every human, heroic, patriotic, and princely virtue, and even &s;uch virtues as are above the reach of humanity. But if, at the &s;ame time, their wi&s;e political maxims are di&s;regarded, and our councils yielded up to the influence of party &s;pirit, dome&s;tic fac|tion, or foreign intrigue, we &s;hall contradict our pro|fe&s;&s;ions, and e&s;&s;entially fail of doing them honour at their deaths: In &s;uch a conduct we will re&s;emble the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, whom our Lord &s;tigmatizes as hypocrites, becau&s;e, while they profe&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t re&s;pect for the dead prophets, by building and garni&s;hing their &s;epul|chres, they per&s;ecuted the living ones. This was a way, in which the inhabitants of Judah and Jeru&s;alem, &s;oon betrayed the want of a due regard to the memory of the excellent Hezekiah. The wi&s;e, pious, and patriotic maxims of his excellent reign, were all quick|ly &s;et a&s;ide by an impious and profligate Mana&s;&s;eh; and the wi&s;e coun&s;ellors, who had &s;tood before the father, were quickly di&s;carded by the &s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="038599_0010_1012336526ED7C10">
But it is time to proceed to the application of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e ob&s;ervations, to the memory of that illu&s;trious per&s;on|age, that truly great man, who has lately fallen in our I&s;rael, who&s;e death has made an impre&s;&s;ion heretofore unknown, upon the minds of citizens of all ranks and characters in America. Probably, in &s;ome in&s;tances, the public demon&s;trations of &s;orrow may have been at|tended with u&s;ele&s;s parade, and &s;ome of little di&s;cern|ment, may have been more taken up with the &s;hew, than affected with the lo&s;s our country has &s;u&s;tained, in being deprived of one of its mo&s;t illu&s;trious ornaments: Yet our lo&s;s is truly great, and to make a &s;uitable im|provement of it, is the only way to prevent its being long felt.</P>
<P>Were I fond of panegyric, I probably have no great talents for the &s;ubject. And if I have little ability, I have as little inclination to give flattering titles unto men. I have frequently turned from funeral eulogies and panegyrics, with di&s;gu&s;t; as being too often, like dedications, compo&s;ed of a particular &s;et of prai&s;es, which are indi&s;criminately lavi&s;hed upon all characters: and encomiums upon per&s;ons of &s;ub&s;tantial worth are, many times, carried too high. But on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion, it will naturally be expected that &s;omething be &s;aid, and in whatever point of view we contemplate the per&s;onage before us, the &s;ubject is copious. I &s;hall not attempt to draw the character of our beloved WASH|INGTON at large. Had I &s;ufficient materials for the ta&s;k, I mu&s;t fatigue both my&s;elf and the audience in the delivery, as it mu&s;t compri&s;e in it a detail of all his great actions, and mu&s;t even de&s;cend into many of the minute circum&s;tances of his life. Let this, therefore, be the bu&s;ine&s;s of the profe&s;&s;ed Biographer. What I &s;hall &s;ay upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, &s;hall probably, be no more, nor even &s;o much as has been already, a thou&s;and times, repeated.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="038599_0011_10123366F1447128">
Here, let it be ob&s;erved, that, as a man and a citi|zen, in the more private walks of life, his character has univer&s;ally been repre&s;ented as amiable, by tho&s;e who were favoured with a per&s;onal knowledge of him. But it was in his public character that we, who are &s;o re|mote from the &s;phere of his acquaintance, knew him; as it was this, that formed the endearing connection be|tween him and his countrymen, and rendered him &s;o univer&s;ally known, beloved and e&s;teemed by his fellow citizens of all ranks, and now renders his death &s;o &s;in|cerely regretted and lamented; a very few &s;trictures hereupon is all that I &s;hall attempt.</P>
<P>And, comparing what he was and did, with the ob|&s;ervations made in the preceding part of our di&s;cour&s;e, is it not evident that a di&s;tingui&s;hing Providence rai&s;ed him up, qualified him, and pointed him out in a pecu|liar manner, as an in&s;trument of &s;ignal good, as a very &s;ingular ble&s;&s;ing to his country, and to mankind. His great and capacious mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed talents which, in ear|ly life, began to unfold them&s;elves to public ob&s;ervation. And they were &s;o far from being of that &s;hewy un&s;ub|&s;tantial kind, which promi&s;e much, but commonly di&s;|appoint the expectation, that they appear to be always equal to the occa&s;ion which called for their exertion. A quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, a penetrating judgment, an aptne&s;s to fore&s;ee, and a prudence to ward off dan|ger and difficulty, a firmne&s;s and deci&s;ion of character, equal to the execution of re&s;olutions, judiciou&s;ly and deliberately taken, and a heart unappalled by oppo&s;ing dangers and difficulties; connected with an un&s;haken regard to the intere&s;ts of his country, marked his char|acter in the various &s;teps both of his civil and military career; and pointed him out as one of the few men, who are equally great in the cabinet and the field.</P>
<P>The future hero of America was early &s;een by &s;ome di&s;cerning minds, in the gallant youth, who in &s;uch a ma&s;terly manner, with &s;o much judgment, courage,
<PB N="13" REF="038599_0012_101233694B1C9AC0">
and conduct, led the &s;hattered remains of Braddock's broken and defeated army, from the field of battle. So noticable was his conduct in this and &s;ome other in|&s;tances, in early life, that the late Pre&s;ident Davies, a character well known to the world by his piety, and valuable writings, after noticing in a &s;ermon, the man|ner in which eminent men are trained up by Providence, for &s;tations of &s;ignal u&s;efulne&s;s in the defence of their country, adds, by way of a note&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sermon preached at Hanover, Augu&s;t 17, 1755, &s;oon after Braddock's defeat, when the Col. was aged 23.</NOTE> <Q>As a remarkable in&s;tance of this, I may point out to the public that he|roic youth Col. WASHINGTON, whom I cannot but hope, Providence has hitherto pre&s;erved in &s;o &s;ignal a manner, for &s;ome important &s;ervice to his country.</Q></P>
<P>Had the good man lived to have &s;een his heroic youth, placed at the head of the armies of his country, in their virtuous &s;truggle for independence, had he &s;een him leading them to victory, and in the i&s;&s;ue &s;een that prophecy literally fulfilled where it is &s;aid, <Q>A nation &s;hall be born in a day;</Q> had he &s;een the con&s;picuous part he took, in procuring our independence, and beheld the fabric of our confederated republic, reared up to &s;uch a good degree of maturity, beneath his fo&s;tering hand, he would have &s;een his prediction completely verified.</P>
<P>In the&s;e youthful di&s;plays of military courage and &s;kill, our WASHINGTON re&s;embled the great Gu&s;|tavus Adolphus of Sweden; an illu&s;trious patriot and warrior of the la&s;t century, who, at the premature age of little more than eighteen, headed an army, and con-contended with &s;ome of the mo&s;t experienced generals in Europe, with all the prudence, courage and per&s;ever|ance, of the mo&s;t veteran commander.</P>
<P>But we are to view our WASHINGTON in a &s;till more exten&s;ive &s;phere of activity and u&s;efulne&s;s; when the unanimous voice of his country placed him at the head of her armies, while &s;he was engaged in that
<PB N="14" REF="038599_0013_1012336BFB23B988">
arduous &s;truggle, which terminated in America's taking a rank among the nations of the world.</P>
<P>To follow him through the various campaigns in which he was engaged, to notice the numerous, and complicated difficulties with which he had to encounter, in forming an undi&s;ciplined multitude into an army of regular &s;oldiers, in &s;truggling with a &s;uperior force, compo&s;ed of troops in the highe&s;t &s;tage of di&s;cipline, and headed by commanders of the greate&s;t military &s;kill and experience, while his own, comparatively, feeble band, was frequently in want of military &s;tores, and di&s;heartened for the lack of pay and clothing, and, many times, kept together by little el&s;e than the re&s;pect they had for their general; I &s;ay to enter into a particu|lar detail of the&s;e things, and to note the prudence, and per&s;evering firmne&s;s, with which he &s;urmounted the greate&s;t difficulties, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hi&s;torian; and an attempt to compri&s;e it in the bounds of a &s;ingle di&s;|cour&s;e, would be both vain and fruitle&s;s. But, &s;o brightly did our WASHINGTON'S character &s;hine, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e difficulties and dangers, as to ex|tort this comprehen&s;ive commendation, from one of the greate&s;t generals and &s;tate&s;men this century has produc|ed, and one who from his well known de&s;potic princi|ples, could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be prejudiced in favour of the cau&s;e in which he was engaged: I mean the il|lu&s;trious Frederick of Pru&s;&s;ia. WASHINGTON, &s;ays he, is a brave general, his hand is an army, and his head a council of &s;tate.</P>
<P>One in&s;tance, in particular, in which, during his military career, this &s;ingle man was, under Providence the in&s;trument of &s;aving his country, mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;|ed in &s;ilence. I mean his manoeuvre on the memora|ble 26th of December 1776. Many of my hearers re|member this, as a period in which the affairs of our country were in the lowe&s;t &s;tate of depre&s;&s;ion. Our armies di&s;per&s;ed, and almo&s;t annihilated, and the &s;hatter|ed
<PB N="15" REF="038599_0014_1012336F79F5F3A0">
remains flying in every direction; every arm was unnerved, and every heart appalled with fear. Then, with a pre&s;ence of mind which never for&s;ook him in times of the greate&s;t danger, he rallied a few veterans; and, in a &s;tormy and tempe&s;tuous night, cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware, beat up the enemies quarters at Trenton, and by afterwards following the blow at Princeton, a new turn was given to our affairs, and a new &s;pirit was infu&s;ed into his drooping, and de&s;ponding countrymen. The&s;e events compared with others which took place during the war, may &s;eem unimportant, yet, connected as they are with their con&s;equences, they gave a new turn to our affairs, and, in the i&s;&s;ue, were the means of &s;aving our country.</P>
<P>But we are to contemplate his character in another point of view. We have &s;een him at the head of our armies, we are al&s;o to view him as the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of a free people. When the old confederation, framed in the time of war, was found by experience to be a bond too feeble to collect the &s;trength of the &s;everal independ|ent &s;tates, for national purpo&s;es, now no longer held together by a &s;ource of common danger, and a new con|&s;titution, better calculated to concentrate the &s;trength of the whole, was formed under his au&s;pices; he was call|ed by the unanimous voice of his country, to fill the chair of fir&s;t magi&s;trate. Here, contrary to his own feelings and wi&s;hes, he again obeyed his country's call, and launched forth anew into public life. It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to attempt a detail of the ability and fidelity with which he filled that important po&s;t. The memory of his &s;ervices will, I tru&s;t, be long fre&s;h upon the minds of his grateful countrymen. And that &s;tate of national re|&s;pectability to which, as a people, we are ri&s;en, under that con&s;titution, cannot fail to endear the memory of an able, faithful, and &s;ucce&s;sful pilot to the hearts of his countrymen. I have only to notice that in this impor|tant
<PB N="16" REF="038599_0015_10123371484EEC30">
office he was, once more, the happy in&s;trument of &s;aving his country.</P>
<P>When the flames of revolution began to &s;pread in France, and Americans, ignorant of the principles and motives of French leaders, and charmed with the &s;ound of liberty, were, almo&s;t to a man, wi&s;hing them to be free from the galling yoke of arbitrary power, and the intrigues of Genet operated like an electric fluid, upon all corners of the land, and many who &s;eemed to be pillars were &s;haken, WASHINGTON'S prudent fore|&s;ight determined upon a neutral &s;tation, and his firmne&s;s was a principal mean of preventing our making a com|mon cau&s;e with France, and launching forth into all the wild career of di&s;organizing madne&s;s, and of pre&s;erving our neutrality, in &s;pite of all open attempts, and &s;ecret intrigues to violate it. Had he, in his official capacity, thrown his influence into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale, or, had he been a man of le&s;s firmne&s;s, and le&s;s weight of character, le&s;s able to check the growth of foreign influence, or the budding of dome&s;tic faction, we would, mo&s;t proba|bly, have been involved in the horrible vortex of Euro|pean politics, and, before this day, been in the degraded, impoveri&s;hed, and wretched &s;ituation of Holland, Swit|zerland, or Geneva. But, by a firmne&s;s, joined with a &s;pirit of di&s;cernment to de&s;cry danger, and a prudent caution in avoiding it, our &s;killful pilot, under Divine Providence, has &s;teered the political bark &s;afe, amid&s;t the rocks, &s;hoals, and quick&s;ands that a&s;&s;ailed it.</P>
<P>One or two traits in his character, which appeared con&s;picuous throughout the whole of his career, civil and military, de&s;erve &s;till farther notice: And, among the&s;e a di&s;intere&s;ted regard to the welfare of his country, a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;acrifice his own ea&s;e and intere&s;t for the public welfare, claims the fir&s;t place. He fought our battles unpaid, and at the clo&s;e of the war he retired, like another Cincinnatus, unpen&s;ioned. And, at a time when he might have ea&s;ily abandoned a po&s;t full of
<PB N="17" REF="038599_0016_1012337612E64D78">
danger, in a manner greatly to his own emolument, and have ri&s;en to eminence upon the &s;poils of his country, he, like Mo&s;es, cho&s;e rather to &s;uffer affliction with his own people, than to &s;ecure to him&s;elf all the honours and emoluments, in the gift of the Briti&s;h King. Such was the man of whom it was, long &s;ince, &s;aid, that neither Briti&s;h arms could &s;ubdue him, Briti&s;h artifice inveigle him, nor Briti&s;h Gold corrupt him.</P>
<P>A &s;ingular manife&s;tation of his di&s;regard to his own emolument, and inviolable attachment to the intere&s;ts of his country appeared at the clo&s;e of the war in 1783; a time when the &s;poils of his country lay at his feet. It is true, the United States never made him a formal tender of their liberties, nor an offer to inve&s;t him with &s;overeign power. But, from the peculiar circum&s;tan|ces which attended the clo&s;e of the war; the army di&s;|contented for want of pay, and, many of them, ripe for any enterprize, and, at the &s;ame time, having an almo&s;t unbounded attachment to, and placing an unlim|ited confidence in their general; had our WASHING|TON been fired with the ambition of a Cae&s;ar or a Crom|wel, with the encouragement &s;et before him, which, it is &s;aid amounted to an indirect invitation to make the attempt, he might ea&s;ily have a&s;&s;umed the title of Pro|tector, Dictator, or whatever el&s;e he cho&s;e, with all the in&s;ignia of &s;overeign authority.</P>
<P>It has been frequently ob&s;erved that there is nothing of which mankind are &s;o tenacious, as power; nothing which they will make &s;o great &s;acrifices to acquire, and nothing which they will relinqui&s;h with &s;o great reluc|tance. And, to confirm the remark, almo&s;t innumera|ble are the in&s;tances in which &s;ucce&s;sful commanders have made u&s;e of their &s;ucce&s;s, and the influence they had obtained over the minds of their fellow &s;oldiers, to climb to &s;overeign authority. But though our WASHING|TON might have acted without control, he cho&s;e rather to live in the hearts of his fellow citizens, and to
<PB N="18" REF="038599_0017_10123377C5AD2FA0">
re&s;ign up his gallant army of hardy veterans, to the ju&s;tice, and genero&s;ity of his country, which has afford|ed them, at lea&s;t a very tardy recompence for all their toils and &s;ufferings, than to keep a commi&s;&s;ion with which he had been entru&s;ted, after the object for which he received it, had been obtained.</P>
<P>It is true, his conduct in this in&s;tance was not alto|gether &s;ingular. A few are recorded in hi&s;tory who, with a peculiar greatne&s;s of mind, &s;acrificed the daz|zling pro&s;pect of advantages, to their country's good. With a noble di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s did the gallant and &s;uc|ce&s;sful Gideon reject the offer of &s;overeignty in I&s;rael, and was afterwards, in his po&s;terity, ba&s;ely requited by his ungrateful countrymen.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JUDGES VIII. 23, 24.</NOTE> <Q>Then the men of I&s;|rael &s;aid unto Gideon, rule thou over us, both thou and thy &s;on, and thy &s;ons &s;on al&s;o, for thou ha&s;t de|livered us out of the hand of Midian. And Gideon &s;aid unto them, I will not rule over you, neither &s;hall my &s;on rule over you, the Lord &s;hall rule over you.</Q> And we have an Andrew Dorra in more modern times, one of the greate&s;t &s;ea Captains of the &s;ixteenth centu|ry, who with a &s;imilar greatne&s;s of &s;oul, rejected the &s;overeignty of his native country Genoa, after deliver|ing it by his arms from the u&s;urped dominion of France: and who grew old as a private citizen, beloved and re&s;pected by his countrymen, and honoured with the title of father of his country, though he would not be its ma&s;ter. Happy for America that our WASHING|TON re&s;embled the&s;e, and &s;ome other worthies of the &s;ame &s;tamp, and not the more numerous cla&s;s, who are continually gra&s;ping after power, and never part with it but with reluctance.</P>
<P>I have only to add that the &s;ame di&s;intere&s;ted regard to the welfare of his country, marked his acceptance of the pre&s;idency, which, con&s;idering his love of retirement, and his abundant employment in it, was a manife&s;t &s;acri|fice
<PB N="19" REF="038599_0018_1012337A2D70C060">
of inclination, to duty. And, under a &s;till addition|al load of declining years, his accepting, at his country's call, a &s;tation &s;ubordinate to one he had formerly held, furni&s;hed a fre&s;h evidence of his prefering the public wel|fare to his own ea&s;e or advantage. And although in his late commi&s;&s;ion of general, there was no particular oc|ca&s;ion for active &s;ervices in the field, yet the readine&s;s with which he obeyed his country's call, and embarked in her cau&s;e, undertaking to face danger at a time when nature needs repo&s;e, afforded a fre&s;h evidence of his di&s;|intere&s;ted attachment. And as he lived, &s;o he died in the &s;ervice of his country.</P>
<P>Another trait in the character of our WASHING|TON, and one which ought to endear his memory to his country, was his love of peace, and his unremitting endeavours, during his admini&s;tration, to procure, and pre&s;erve it. This is a trait of character which is far from being as common as it ought, among great mili|tary per&s;onages. But a WASHINGTON never drew his &s;word only in the defence of his country, and its deare&s;t rights. And whenever the object for which he took up arms was obtained, with what heartfelt &s;atisfac|tion did he &s;heathe it, and return to the peaceful duties of a private citizen? The Alexanders, the Cae&s;ars, and other heroes of antiquity, with their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors and imi|tators in more modern times, appeared to delight in blood and carnage. Many heroes, generals and con|querors, have been reputed great, in proportion as they turned the world into a de&s;art, and have brought ruin, mi&s;ery and &s;lavery upon mankind. Their motives were lawle&s;s ambition, and an undue lu&s;t after dominion, to which they could lay no other claim but force. A hero or a conqueror has, for this rea&s;on, been ju&s;tly accounted a term &s;ynonymous with a &s;courge, and a cur&s;e to man|kind. But our WASHINGTON prized the peace and happine&s;s of his country. The favourite maxim of his admini&s;tration was, to &s;eek peace and pur&s;ue it,
<PB N="20" REF="038599_0019_1012337C1B807F30">
though he would not &s;hrink from a nece&s;&s;ary war. This trait in his character di&s;po&s;ed him &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to main|tain our neutrality during the pre&s;ent European conte&s;ts, which have deluged the ea&s;tern world in blood. His character, therefore, has not improperly been &s;ummed up in this comprehen&s;ive manner: Fir&s;t in war; fir&s;t in peace, and fir&s;t in the hearts of his countrymen.</P>
<P>Another di&s;tingui&s;hed trait in his character, if it may not be rather denominated a &s;ingular providence, where|by he was put in a capacity for more exten&s;ive u&s;eful|ne&s;s, was the &s;urpri&s;ing union of all hearts and voices in his favour. This was partly owing to his very &s;ingular merits and talents, and partly to a kind Providence in his own and country's behalf. When &s;eeking for a chief commander to head our armies, every voice point|ed to him as the man, and when a Pre&s;ident of the United States was &s;ought for, no other object was thought of&punc; Perhaps we may ran&s;ack the pages of hi&s;tory in vain, to find another, who, for &s;o long a time, and in &s;uch a great variety of trying circum&s;tances, had &s;uch an entire union of all hearts in his favour, and maintained his popularity unimpaired, and almo&s;t unenvied. In all the trying &s;cenes which he went through, during eight years war, his character was &s;ecure, even again&s;t calumny it|&s;elf. And in the eight years in which he filled the pre&s;i|dential chair, if we except the feeble attempts of a fac|tion, the dupes of French intrigue, and who&s;e leaders would &s;acrifice their country, their religion, and their God, at the &s;hrine of French liberty, another name for the mo&s;t dete&s;table &s;lavery, his character has been un|a&s;&s;ailed. And the&s;e feeble attempts have tended, in the end, to brighten its lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Such are a few traits in the public character of that great man, who has lately fallen in our I&s;rael. It would be more than falls to the portion of humanity, to &s;up|po&s;e him perfectly free from faults and blemi&s;hes. But if there were failings in his public character, they were
<PB N="21" REF="038599_0020_10122DE98BB27608">
as few, and his public virtues and great talents, as &s;plend|ed and as numerous, as we can rea&s;onably expect to fall to the lot of a mortal. My de&s;ign was not to touch upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> private character. This, from every &s;ource of information of which we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, was amiable. His public official character did not lead him to any particular di&s;play of his religious &s;y&s;tem. Only, in his communications which have come before the world, we find him frequently urging the nece&s;&s;ity and importance of religion in general, and expre&s;&s;ing a firm and un&s;haken reliance upon Providence: And, &s;o far as an exten&s;ive benevolence to mankind, and integrity and uprightne&s;s of conduct, are evidences of the reality of religion, they were copied in his life. And that calm fortitude which was ever con&s;picuous in his life, did not for&s;ake him in his death.</P>
<P>I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s this part of my &s;ubject with one &s;ingle ob&s;ervation, viz. That tho&s;e virtues which adorn the chri&s;tian character are not of that &s;plendid kind, which catch the attention and command the admiration of the world, but the uno&s;tentatious ones, of humility, meek|ne&s;s and &s;elfdenial; and in tho&s;e things which are pecu|liar to chri&s;tianity, the greate&s;t and the lea&s;t are all alike. If the greate&s;t hero or &s;tate&s;man is a chri&s;tian, it is be|cau&s;e he has tho&s;e virtues in common with the meane&s;t, and not becau&s;e he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e &s;plendid talents which adorn a public character: Though the mo&s;t ex|alted character cannot fail to derive an additional lu&s;tre from the impre&s;&s;ion of the peculiar chri&s;tian virtues, on the heart and life.</P>
<P>Such was the man to whom his country, in &s;o many ways, e&s;&s;ays to do honour in his death. But he is gone, and the places which once knew him, &s;hall know him again no more. Though ju&s;tly entitled to the appella|tion of a God upon earth, in the &s;en&s;e in which that title is applied to magi&s;trates and rulers, he hath died like a common and ordinary man. His du&s;t returns unto du&s;t,
<PB N="22" REF="038599_0021_10123382F9B69CC8">
and, in a &s;hort time, unle&s;s it is by the co&s;tly monument that covers it, will be undi&s;tingui&s;hable from that of a common beggar, as a &s;triking monument of the vanity of every thing that is earthy. We need not invite his grateful countrymen to honour him at his death, either by a &s;umptuous funeral, by lamenting their lo&s;s, or by eulogies upon his character and worth. Of this kind of re&s;pect there &s;eems to be no deficiency. The danger is rather, that we &s;hall exceed, by giving him more honour than either is, or can be due to a mere man. But there are two ways of honouring him in his death, in which we cannot exceed, <HI>i. e.</HI> By continuing to depend upon, and adore that Divine Providence which rai&s;ed him up, and made him what h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was: And by following his ex|ample as a &s;tate&s;man, or by practicing the wi&s;e maxims of his admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>As to his being rai&s;ed up by Providence, and fitted for the work to which he was called by his country; he was as truly &s;o as Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, Gideon, David, Sam|uel and others, though not preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner. And we never can pay a greater tribute to his memory, than by a&s;cribing the glory of all he was and did, to the &s;upreme fir&s;t cau&s;e. If we have &s;een him the enlighten|ed &s;tate&s;man, the great and &s;ucce&s;sful commander, or the patriotic, virtuous citizen, we have &s;een him <HI>ju&s;t</HI> that in him&s;elf, and to his country, which the all-wi&s;e di&s;|po&s;er of events was plea&s;ed to make him, and to his name be the glory. And the &s;ame Divine Providence can rai&s;e up other in&s;truments, equally qualified, when|ever they are needed.</P>
<P>As to imitating his example, or copying after the wi&s;e maxims of his admini&s;tration, to mention no more, his farewell addre&s;s upon his declining a reelection to the pre&s;idency, is a political legacy of ine&s;timable value, the wi&s;e maxims of which ought never to be out of view; particularly that part of it, which relates to foreign in|fluence, and foreign connections.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="038599_0022_101233858D0B3BC0">
Lycurgus, the famous lawgiver of Sparta, in order to give perpetuity to his laws, withdrew from his country, profe&s;&s;edly only for a time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd exacted an oath of his fellow citizens, that they would make no alteration in his laws till his return. But, in&s;tead of returning, he went into voluntary exile, and, at his death, ordered his remains to be thrown into the &s;ea, le&s;t they &s;hould be car|ried back to Sparta, and the citizens &s;hould think them|&s;elves thereby ab&s;olved from the obligation of their oath.</P>
<P>If a method equally efficacious could be adopted, to render the wi&s;e maxims of our WASHINGTON per|petual, particularly &s;o far as they relate to foreign influ|ence, and foreign connections, the bane of all free &s;tates, it would be happy for our country. Di&s;connected as &s;he is, by nature, &s;ituation and intere&s;t, from the other quarters of the globe, America needs a political con|nection with no nation under heaven, nor can &s;uch a connection ever be any thing el&s;e than a public cur&s;e. And as for mercantile connections, they ought to be ex|tended indi&s;criminately to all nations, &s;o far as they are &s;upported by mutual advantage, the only bond of con|nection between nations, and no farther: Whenever therefore, the time &s;hall come in which foreign influence &s;hall guide our councils, it matters not whether it is French or Briti&s;h, Au&s;trian or Ru&s;&s;ian, Dutch or Spani&s;h; and we &s;hall enter, with &s;pirit, into all the intrigues, cabals, and quarrels of European nations: If ever the time comes when, forgetting the dignity of our own national character, we &s;hall be divided into French and Briti&s;h factions, we may bid adieu to our peace, pro&s;perity, and even independence as a nation.</P>
<P>A melancholy proof of the deleterious effect of foreign influence, to the peace, happine&s;s, and independence of a nation, may be &s;een in illfated Poland. Poland, which, if inhabited by an enlightened, free, and independent peo|ple, is calculated by nature and &s;ituation, to be one of the faire&s;t portions of Europe. But Poland was a prey to
<PB N="24" REF="038599_0023_1012338747BF7D70">
foreign influence. She had her Ru&s;&s;ian, Pru&s;&s;ian, Au&s;|trian and French factions: She had al&s;o her religious factions; armed again&s;t each other with all the animo&s;ity of party zeal. And what was the con&s;equence? She was fir&s;t de&s;olated by a civil war, then di&s;membered of &s;ome of her faire&s;t provinces, and, by the late partition, &s;he cea&s;es to be an independent nation. If ever Ameri|ca becomes a prey to foreign influence, and is doomed to &s;uch a cur&s;e, a partition of her fair inheritance may, one day, compromi&s;e a quarrel between Britain, France, or &s;ome other European powers. Let us therefore hon|our our decea&s;ed WASHINGTON, who, though dead yet &s;peaketh, in his excellent parental advices; and con|&s;ult our own happine&s;s and national pro&s;perity, by bear|ing in mind, and &s;teadily practi&s;ing the&s;e excellent max|ims of his admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>While we expre&s;s our &s;en&s;ibility for the lo&s;s of a WASHINGTON, we ought not to forget to pay a ju&s;t tribute of re&s;pect to other illu&s;trious characters, who have de&s;erved well of their country, and who have lately fini&s;hed their earthly cour&s;e; and who&s;e memories ought to live in the brea&s;ts of their fellow citizens. The year 1799 has been uncommonly mortal among illu&s;trious characters. To mention a few: This commonwealth has lo&s;t an enlightened &s;tate&s;man, and illu&s;trious patriot; a man who was ju&s;tly con&s;idered an ornament to his country, in our late excellent Governor SUMNER: Penn|&s;ylvania has lo&s;t her MIFFLIN, the late governor of the &s;tate; a man heretofore well e&s;teemed, both as a &s;tate&s;|man and military commander: Virginia has lo&s;t a &s;tate&s;|man, and a patriot of di&s;tingui&s;hed worth, in her late Governor, PATRICK HENRY: Maryland has, likewi&s;e, lo&s;t a di&s;tingui&s;hed character, &s;ometimes governor, of the &s;ame name. South-Carolina has lo&s;t her Governor RUTLEDGE, a man who has long been con&s;idered as one of her mo&s;t illu&s;trious citizens: And the Supreme Fed|eral Bench has lo&s;t two of its ornaments, by the

<P>Such an uncommon mortality among illu&s;trious char|acters, in &s;o &s;hort a time, is an event which but rarely happens; and when it falls out, is one which calls for the mo&s;t &s;erious attention. Frequently &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;a|tion has been the forerunner of &s;ome &s;ignal calamity. Good men are removed out of the reach of evils they can|not avert.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ISA. LVII. 1.</NOTE><Q>The righteous peri&s;heth, (faith the word of in&s;piration&punc;) and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none con&s;idering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</Q> There was a mo&s;t &s;ignal calamity threaten|ed upon Judah and Jeru&s;alem, by the Prophets, in the&s;e words:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">ISAI. III. 1, 2, 3, 4.</NOTE><Q>For behold the Lord, the Lord of ho&s;ts, doth take away from Judah and Jeru&s;alem, the &s;tay and the &s;taff. The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge and the prophet, the prudent and the ancient, the captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the coun&s;ellor; and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. And I will give children to be their princes, and &s;trangers &s;hall rule over them.</Q> Chil|dren not in age, but in knowledge, and political fore|&s;ight. Two or three in&s;tances we may &s;elect from &s;crip|ture, wherein the deaths of eminently great and good men, were followed with &s;ignal calamities to the na|tion, viz. The deaths of good Hezekiah, the &s;ubject of our text, and of his great grand&s;on, the &s;ingularly virtuous and pious Jo&s;iah, who was &s;lain in the valley of Megiddo; and the death of Jehoiada the prie&s;t, who was &s;uch a great benefactor to the nation, and &s;uch a faithful coun&s;ellor to Joa&s;h. At the&s;e &s;everal periods the nation appears to have been ripe for &s;courge, and to de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed with the wickedne&s;s of Mana&s;&s;eh, and of Jo|&s;iah's &s;ons, and the folly of Joa&s;h, rather than be ble&s;&s;ed
<PB N="26" REF="038599_0025_1012338D22FDA828">
with the virtue, piety, and wi&s;dom of Hezekiah or Jo&s;iah, and the prudent coun&s;els of the aged and wi&s;e Jehoiada. God, therefore, gave them princes in his anger, and &s;ub|jected them to a throne of iniquity, which e&s;tabli&s;hed mi&s;chief by a law.</P>
<P>But we would wi&s;h to deprecate de&s;erved judgments, and hope for better things in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. Per|haps Providence may have a different purpo&s;e in view. Perhaps it may be to teach us the vanity, and even fol|ly of placing too great dependence upon any in&s;trument what&s;oever; or of thinking more highly of a fellow worm, of mere du&s;t and a&s;hes, than we ought to think. God's hand is, by no means &s;hortened, that he cannot &s;ave. And when determined to &s;ave a people, in&s;tru|ments can never be wanting for that purpo&s;e. He can rai&s;e up WASHINGTONS without number, when either the advancement of his own glory, or the happi|ne&s;s of a people, whom he delights to &s;ave, &s;hall re|quire it. So long as we are a people favoured of heaven, we never &s;hall be wanting in leaders, either to head our troops in the field, if nece&s;&s;ary, or to guide the helm, in the mo&s;t intricate affairs of &s;tate. Such in&s;truments, we tru&s;t, are not wanting at pre&s;ent. Tho' a WASH|INGTON is gone we have an ADAMS left, and when he &s;hall have &s;erved his generation as long as Provi|dence &s;ees meet, he by whom kings reign, and who is a &s;pirit of judgement to tho&s;e who &s;it in judgement, can, and probably will rai&s;e up, and qualify others in &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, equally great and good, and make them ble&s;&s;ings equally eminent in their day and generation, as a Jo&s;hua &s;ucceeded Mo&s;es, and Eleazer &s;ucceeded Aaron, and Solomon filled the throne of his father David.</P>
<P>There are, it is true, particular &s;ea&s;ons, which &s;ome|times occur, in which the death of even one great and eminent man, may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as a very &s;ingu|lar calamity. As, when he is taken away at a time in which the &s;ucce&s;s of a cau&s;e, great and important to
<PB N="27" REF="038599_0026_1012338ED2F1BB40">
the happine&s;s of mankind, depends, in a great mea&s;ure, upon a &s;ingle life. But, even then, &s;uch in&s;truments are &s;ometimes taken away, merely to &s;how us the vani|ty of creature dependence. A &s;triking in&s;tance of this kind we &s;ee in that &s;ingularly great and good man, Gu&s;tavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, commonly call|ed Gu&s;tavus the &s;econd. His amazing abilities, both in the cabinet and the field, pointed him out, as a fit in&s;trument to place at the head of the prote&s;tant league, at a very critical time, for oppo&s;ing the tyrannical, and &s;eemingly irre&s;i&s;tible encroachments of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, again&s;t both the civil and religious liberties of the prote&s;tants in Germany. And the event fully te&s;tified the choice they had made. He was the princi|pal cement, and even &s;oul of the confederacy. Succe&s;s attended nearly all his enterpri&s;es. But, at a critical moment, when the force of the confederacy &s;eemed to re&s;t on his &s;ingle life, and, in the mid&s;t of a career of victory, he met the fatal bullet on the field of battle, on the plains of Lutgen, at the premature age of thirty eight. But, though a univer&s;al con&s;ternation &s;pread over one half of Europe, and the other half rejoiced at his death, yet the cau&s;e did not die with him. The plan of the confederacy had been &s;o happily laid, and &s;o well cemented, and &s;uch able in&s;truments &s;urvived him, who had been trained up under &s;o great a ma&s;ter, as complet|ed the work he had &s;o happily begun; God by this di&s;|pen&s;ation, probably giving a practical le&s;&s;on to the world, not to lay too much dependence upon any one mere man, however eminently great and good.</P>
<P>Our WASHINGTON has, it is true, been taken away in a citical time, a time when his &s;ervices were highly nece&s;&s;ary to his country, to unite her divided councils, in the &s;y&s;tem of defen&s;ive oppo&s;ition to the unju&s;t encroachments of France; as well as by the weight of his character, to check the progre&s;s, and counteract the baneful effects of foreign influence. At a time when
<PB N="28" REF="038599_0027_10123390D6A07EE8">
his country &s;eemed to need, and his athletic con&s;titution, tho' in an advanced age, to promi&s;e a longer continuance of his &s;ervices. Yet, in many re&s;pects, his death cannot be called premature. He was &s;paired, not only till his military command had been conducted to a &s;ucce&s;sful termination, by an honourable peace, and the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of our independence, but al&s;o, till he had conduct|ed the political bark &s;o far, that we had grown up to a good degree of national re&s;pectability, and till he had arrived at a good old age. In&s;tead, therefore, of re|gretting that he was mortal, and that, when he had &s;erved his generation, he died like a common ordinary man, let grateful America expre&s;s their thankfulne&s;s to him by whom kings reign, that &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hed character was rai&s;ed up at a critical time, that he was, by Providence, &s;o well qualified for the great undertak|ing in which we have &s;een him engaged, that he was &s;paired &s;o long, even till his work was completed, and his endeavours for the good of his country crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, and that the cau&s;e of liberty and America &s;till lives. While we cea&s;e from man who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils, let us tru&s;t in the Lord forever; for in the Lord there is everla&s;ting &s;trength. Our WASHINGTON has already done as much for us, as we could rationally expect from a mere man. And, unle&s;s we are di&s;po&s;ed to attribute part of the glory to a creature, which is ju&s;t|ly due to the God of armies, why &s;hould we de&s;ire more?</P>
<P>I cannot di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject without making one &s;in|gle remark more, which appears to be &s;ugge&s;ted by that pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred hi&s;tory, cho&s;en as the foundation of our pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e. Hezekiah &s;lept with his fathers, and Mana&s;&s;eh his &s;on, reigned in his &s;tead. A mo&s;t wicked profligate &s;on, of a mo&s;t pious, virtuous, and illu&s;trious father. Hezekiah appears as a bright &s;hining &s;un, be|tween two very black clouds, Ahaz and Mana&s;&s;eh. Hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion frequently &s;ubjects nations to evils of this kind. It paves the way for &s;udden tran&s;itions
<PB N="29" REF="038599_0028_10123393443485D8">
from the be&s;t to the wor&s;t of Princes. Where heredita|ry &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is con&s;idered as e&s;&s;ential to the e&s;tabli&s;hed government of a nation, it happens, and that not &s;eldom, that both children and babes in a literal &s;en&s;e, as well as children in knowledge, and experience, tho' full grown men in all the vices which tarni&s;h degenerate human nature, are given to nations to be their princes; and &s;trangers to their country's true intere&s;ts, as well as to the feelings of humanity, &s;way the &s;ceptre.</P>
<P>Tho the world has, at different times, been ble&s;&s;ed with numbers of excellent princes, who have been nur&s;|ing fathers to their country, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">h knowing and &s;teadily pur&s;uing its true intere&s;ts; and who, for beneficence, have re&s;embled the Sun when it breaks forth from un|der a cloud&punc; and &s;hines in its full &s;trength; yet a com|plete hi&s;tory of all the illu&s;trious madmen, who under the name, and in the character of Princes, have &s;ported with the lives and liberties of mankind, and have ca&s;t about firebrands, arrows and death, in &s;hort, would chill the blood with horror.</P>
<P>The education which hereditary princes receive, pre|vious to their arriving at &s;upreme power in the &s;tate, is, frequently, but little calculated to cultivate tho&s;e princi|ples, either of the under&s;tanding or heart, which are nece&s;&s;ary to make wi&s;e and virtuous rulers. Born with the expectation of a throne, they con&s;ider it as their nat|ural inheritance, which mu&s;t de&s;cend to them of cour&s;e, whether they po&s;&s;e&s;s one &s;ingle qualification for it or no, they are hereby deprived of one very powerful &s;timulous to excell. For if we con&s;ider human nature to be the &s;ame in them, that it is in other men, they are, certain|ly, under very &s;trong temptations to neglect the cultiva|tion of their under&s;tandings. Being nur&s;ed up in the idea of their natural &s;uperiority to other men, it is not to be wondered at, if, many times, they rather con&s;ider the nation as their property, than their promotion as given them for the good of the nation. And being fre|quently, from their early infancy, &s;urrounded with crowds
<PB N="30" REF="038599_0029_10123395F9132138">
of flatterers, who treat even their vices and foibles with every degree of deference and indulgence, in expectation of future favours, can it be thought &s;trange, that, many times, they &s;hould rather abu&s;e, than make a right u&s;e of that authority with which they are clothed?</P>
<P>In limited Monarchies, even the virtues and talents of a &s;overeign, may be, &s;ometimes, dangerous to the lib|erties of a people. A &s;en&s;ible Briti&s;h writer, whom I can quote only from memory and, probably, not with any con&s;iderable degree of exactne&s;s, has an ob&s;ervation much to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, which may apply to other nations as well as Britain. <Q>Whenever a prince of great abilities, &s;ingular virtues, and &s;uch eminently popular talents as &s;hall unite all hearts in his favour, &s;hall fill the throne of Great Britain, I tremble for the liberties of my country. Tho Britons are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ufficient re&s;olution and energy to defend their liberties, again&s;t any open encroachments of Arbitrary power, yet they may be ea&s;ily &s;educed by the bewitching glare of popularity, to &s;urrender tho&s;e prerogatives to a prince, of &s;ingularly eminent talents and virtues, which may prove a rod of iron in the hand of a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, of an oppo&s;ite character.</Q> A &s;ingular in|&s;tance of the danger of the popular virtues of a &s;ove|reign to the liberties of a free people, we have in the famous Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a, commonly called Gu&s;tavus the fir&s;t, the noted Swedi&s;h hero of the &s;ixteenth century, who &s;ingly projected, and after &s;urmounting an infinity of difficulties, the bare recital of which, were they not &s;ufficiently atte&s;ted, would &s;tagger belief, effected the de|liverance of his country from the cruel, and tyrannical yoke of Denmark. Having delivered his native land from a galling foreign yoke, he was cho&s;en, fir&s;t admin|i&s;trator, and &s;oon after, king of Sweden. His country after having had &s;uch large experience of his incompar|able abilities, and eminent virtues, loaded him with every honour that a grateful people could be&s;tow; and made &s;uch daily, and gradual additions to his preroga|tive,
<PB N="31" REF="038599_0030_1012339970044838">
that he became, in a manner, an ab&s;olute prince. Such was the wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, and energy of his admin|i&s;tration, tempered with mildne&s;s and benevolence; and &s;o &s;teadily, and uniformly, were all the mea&s;ures of his admini&s;tration; directed to that object which is the ulti|mate end of all good government, viz. the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of his people, that the happy Swedes felt no inconvenience from his exten&s;ive, and almo&s;t unlim|ited authority. But when his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, without his tal|ents, and without his virtues, claimed his exten&s;ive pre|rogative, Sweden was well nigh reduced to &s;lavery, which it avoided only by wading thro' the horrors of a civil war, in which the &s;on, and immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the great Gu&s;tavus, was ju&s;tly expelled from that throne which he had deba&s;ed, but which his worthy fa|ther had &s;o dearly purcha&s;ed, &s;o richly merited, and fill|ed with &s;uch dignity. Happy America, if &s;he but knew, and duly e&s;timated her privileges; in being favoured with an elective, in&s;tead of an hereditary government.</P>
<P>A late celebrated traveller, (Margrave of Baden,) &s;peaking of &s;ome one of the German Principalities, I forget which, takes notice of the &s;ingular happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of the people of that principality, which was chiefly owing to the virtues and talents of the reigning Prince, and contra&s;ts it with the depre&s;&s;ion and mi&s;ery of the people, under princes of an oppo&s;ite character, clo&s;es his remarks with this judicious ob&s;ervation. <Q>Such a prince is really a public ble&s;&s;ing, and that people are &s;ingularly fortunate who live under &s;uch a government. But much more fortunate are they who&s;e liberties are protected by the government of their country, inde|pendent of the good and in &s;pite of the evil qualities of reigning princes.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. MOORE'S View of Society and Manners in France, &amp;c. &amp;c Vol. 1. Page 186.</NOTE></P>
<P>I confe&s;s that for my&s;elf, I have &s;ometimes indulged the thought, that it was not a di&s;agreeable event for his country, that our late illu&s;trious and beloved chief had
<PB N="32" REF="038599_0031_1012339B23549228">
no natural heirs, le&s;t that, in time, the high re&s;pect which was &s;o ju&s;tly paid to the father, might upon the father's account rather than on account of any di&s;tingui&s;hing virtues in the &s;on, de&s;cend to his po&s;terity. But happy is it for America that her liberties re&s;t upon a firmer ba&s;is, than to depend upon the virtues and talents of any &s;ingle man, though it were even a WASHINGTON. Nor are we expo&s;ed to have them wre&s;ted from us, by, either the artifice, ambition, or wickedne&s;s, of an indi|vidual, till we de&s;erve to loo&s;e them. But, when the time comes in which, by our vices we &s;hall forfeit the protection of heaven, and by our faction and di&s;union, &s;hall &s;ap the foundations of our own &s;trength, then we will de&s;erve to be &s;laves; and &s;ome fortunate, and fac|tious demagogue, aided by a military force, may mount into the &s;eat of &s;upreme authority, and pro&s;trate the lib|erties of his country under his feet. To effect &s;uch a change as this, when we &s;hall be ripe for it, a Cae&s;ar; a Cromwel or a Buonaparte, will not be wanting. But if public and private virtues &s;hall continue to be cultivated, and the &s;acred principles of genuine religion and moral|ity treated with due attention: If vice and immorality of every kind could be univer&s;ally checked and di&s;couraged, if knowledge &s;hall continue to be diffu&s;ed, and even in|crea&s;e among all ranks of our citizens; if the funda|mental principles of our free republican con&s;titution, continue to be duly re&s;pected; if the &s;eeds of fac|tion and di&s;union, might be eradicated, and harmony e&s;tabli&s;hed among the various departments; if foreign in|fluence, the bane of all free &s;tates, could be completely bani&s;hed, and virtue and talents principally re&s;pected, in the advancement of men to places of important public tru&s;t,&mdash;May we not entertain a hope, that, through tho kindne&s;s of indulgent heaven, future WASHINGTONS will be rai&s;ed up as our nece&s;&s;ities may require, and that the fair fabric of American liberty will de&s;cend unim|paired to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
