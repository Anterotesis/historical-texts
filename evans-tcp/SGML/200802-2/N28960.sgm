<P>AND THEY SPAKE OF JOSIAH IN THEIR LAMENTATIONS TO THIS DAY, AND MADE THEM AN ORDINANCE IN ISRAEL.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE cannot wonder that the people of I&s;rael were thus deeply affected by the death of a good prince who was their warm friend and their great benefactor. JOSIAH was the common centre around which every good citizen of Judah revolved; and on him they relied, under GOD, to defend their country if invaded from a|broad, and to cru&s;h, with the weight of his name and virtues, faction and rebellion at home.</P>
<P>HOW melancholy is the reflection that in the uni|ver&s;al dominion of death over the human race, men of the mo&s;t &s;ublime virtues and mo&s;t illu&s;trious tal|ents, are not only &s;ubjected to it, but frequently be|come the more early victims of his power; while &s;ome others who cumber the ground, and infe&s;t &s;o|ciety, &s;till live to di&s;turb and di&s;tre&s;s all around them! We cannot comprehend the de&s;igns of Providence! It becomes us only to &s;ubmit and to adore, to bow
<PB N="6" REF="038618_0005_1012A830417BC6A8">
before the throne of the highe&s;t, encircled as it may be with the thicke&s;t clouds, and to know that "the Judge of all the earth will do right."</P>
<P>ALAS! that the empire of death is &s;o univer&s;al; that the wi&s;e and the prudent, the brave and the virtuous, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to its power, as well as "the fool and the bruti&s;h per&s;on." It is indeed "ap|pointed unto all men once to die, and there is no di&s;charge in that war."</P>
<P>WHEN the power of the king of terrors is exerci&s;|ed over tho&s;e who, like JOSIAH, were highly e&s;teem|ed and fondly beloved; when it levels, with its fa|tal wand, the men who &s;tood high above their fel|low mortals, and removes to their long home tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ervices and &s;ufferings had purcha&s;ed the free|dom and happine&s;s of a nation, we cannot be &s;ur|pri&s;ed that uncommon grief &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the heart, and uncommon tokens of mourning &s;hould be di&s;|played!</P>
<P>THE people of Judah, not content with &s;imply committing their hero to the tomb, and bedewing his hear&s;e with the tears which a recent lo&s;s occa|&s;ions, re&s;olved to manife&s;t their grief by long and uncommon mourning. All Judah and Jeru&s;alem, we are told, mourned for JOSIAH. They attended his remains to the &s;epulchre of his fathers, with deep and &s;olemn grief. But they did not cea&s;e the ex|pre&s;&s;ions of it, when the clods of the valley covered him, and the grave concealed him from their view. But, "led by JEREMIAH, the prophet of the LORD, they lamented for JOSIAH." Determined to per|petuate their gratitude, "the &s;inging men and wo|men
<PB N="7" REF="038618_0006_1012A83786728728">
(the poets and hi&s;torians of that age) &s;pake of JOSIAH in their lamentations to the very day" in which the chronicles were written. This was many years after the death of JOSIAH; probably after the return of the Jews from the Babyloni&s;h captivity, when the &s;acred canon was completed, under the au&s;pices of heaven, by EZRA the high prie&s;t of the LORD.</P>
<P>WHEN we lo&s;e tho&s;e who are peculiarly dear to us, and tho&s;e whom we highly honor, we cannot endure the idea of their being forgotten. We determine that they &s;hall live in our remem|brance, and that their names &s;hall be tran&s;mitted with honor and re&s;pect to the "generations which are yet to be born." It is a &s;entiment &s;imilar to the&s;e which led our civil fathers to in&s;titute the re|ligious &s;olemnities in which we are now engaged. Some weeks have elap&s;ed &s;ince we were deprived of the great and good man who was &s;o long the pride and the father of his country. Every thing which gratitude could dictate, affection in&s;pire and elo|quence expre&s;s has already been &s;aid and done on this occa&s;ion. The &s;ervice before me is therefore a difficult one.</P>
<P>BUT, this &s;olemnity is of a religious nature. The humble wor&s;hip of the Deity is our object, and a moral improvement of a death &s;o affecting, our de|&s;ign in the exerci&s;e before us. My duty is not that of the eulogi&s;ts, who&s;e cla&s;&s;ic elegance and glowing de&s;cription have drawn the character of the illu&s;tri|ous dead, and richly emblazoned his fame. No; it belongs to the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e to lead our thoughts
<PB N="8" REF="038618_0007_1012A83A638206E0">
from earth to heaven; to adore the divine &s;over|eignty; to acknowledge his gracious hand in all that the departed was him&s;elf and did for us; and to point out the le&s;&s;ons of wi&s;dom, civil and religious, which we may learn from the affecting event!</P>
<P>THE &s;overeignty of GOD, like the thunders and lightnings and thick cloud which &s;urrounded him on Mount Sinai, veils from our eyes many of the motives which influence the divine conduct, and oper|ate in the government of the world. Without con|troul or re&s;traint he does his plea&s;ure in heaven a|bove and on earth beneath. GOD is ab&s;olute and unlimited in his will and purpo&s;es. Him&s;elf the fir&s;t cau&s;e, the &s;ource, the fountain of all exi&s;tence and energy, he has communicated to his creatures whatever they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and the highe&s;t archangel in heaven is as entirely &s;ubjected to the divine &s;over|eignty as the meane&s;t reptile on earth. "GOD is a rock, and his work is perfect." The plan of his government is fixed beyond alteration, and all crea|tures are in his hands as the "clay is in the hands of the potter."</P>
<P>THE divine &s;overeignty would be a doctrine of terror and di&s;tre&s;s to us, did we not know that it re|&s;ided in a being perfectly wi&s;e and e&s;&s;entially good. It is not the exerci&s;e of power, prompted by caprice, actuated by re&s;entment, or dictated by folly. It is the re&s;ult of infinite wi&s;dom which beholds the pa&s;t, the pre&s;ent and the future at one view, which knows the nature and the con&s;equences of all events, and will bring them to pa&s;s in the time and by the means which are mo&s;t honorary to him, and mo&s;t benefi|cial
<PB N="9" REF="038618_0008_1012A83D56D31FD8">
to his creatures. Viewed in this light, the &s;ov|ereignty of GOD &s;hould calm our hearts, engage our tru&s;t, command our obedience, and elevate our af|fections. With the inhabitants of heaven we &s;hould in humble devotion and grateful rapture, exclaim, "Alleluia, the LORD GOD omnipotent reigneth!"</P>
<P>IN all the circum&s;tances which relate to the world and to man, from the revolution of a kingdom to the lighting of a &s;parrow, we view and &s;hould ac|knowledge this &s;overeign providence of the mo&s;t HIGH. "In him we live and move and have our being." We are &s;upported by his bounty, defend|ed by his power, pardoned by his grace, and &s;ancti|fied by his &s;pirit. Surrounded by his immen&s;ity, we are always before his eyes. He upholds us in life. His "vi&s;itation pre&s;erves our &s;pirits," and he has determined the bounds of our habitations which we cannot pa&s;s."</P>
<P>DEATH is an intere&s;ting period to us all, and for wi&s;e purpo&s;es we are made to dread its approaches. When its icy hand is laid upon us, or when its fa|tal vortex &s;wallows up tho&s;e who are dear to us as our&s;elves, then we &s;hould reali&s;e the &s;overeignty of GOD. "Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? there is no man who hath power over the &s;pirit to retain the &s;pirit in the day of death." When the decree goes forth from the eternal throne, when the "time, the &s;et time" is come, then the grim tyrant performs his fatal office. The prayers and tears of an a&s;&s;embled nation; the fonde&s;t affection of imme|diate friends; the mo&s;t brilliant virtues; the mo&s;t illu&s;trious character; the e&s;teem and honor and
<PB N="10" REF="038618_0009_1012A83F34BFF7A0">
veneration of a world cannot for a moment arre&s;t the progre&s;s or prevent the approach of death! The great and the &s;mall; the high and the low, the rich and the poor, bow their heads and die!</P>
<P>BUT under the exerci&s;e of this act of &s;overeign|ty, at a day of lamentation like the pre&s;ent, let us contemplate the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of GOD. "He is in heaven and we are up|on earth, and therefore it becomes us that our words &s;hould be few." Our under&s;tandings, darkened by &s;in and clogged with mortality, are &s;ometimes per|plexed with the ways of GOD. But &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will becomes us who "are of ye&s;terday, and know nothing." We are as certain as he exi&s;ts that GOD cannot do wrong. When therefore we mourn a lo&s;s like that which now covers America with &s;adne&s;s, we are to &s;ubmit without a murmer to tho&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations which we cannot comprehend, and keep "our hearts fixed, tru&s;ting in the LORD."</P>
<P>BUT when, in our lamentations, we &s;peak of the friends, the patrons whom we have lo&s;t, we cannot fail to recollect their amiable characters and their excellent virtues.</P>
<P>LET us con&s;tantly remember that GOD is the &s;ource of all virtue and of all excellency; that mor|tals are good in them&s;elves and u&s;eful to us as he makes them to be &s;o. We may meditate with plea&s;|ure on their virtues. We may remember them with the warme&s;t e&s;teem and tendere&s;t affection; but we &s;hould never be unmindful, that every talent of nature, of rea&s;on and of art, de&s;cends from him who is "the father of our &s;pirits, the former of our bodies, and the author of all our mercies."</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="038618_0010_1012A844D3E2F528">WE mourn this day "a prince and a great man fallen in our I&s;rael;" a man more truly elevated in the e&s;teem of the world than any monarch who wields a &s;ceptre, or any hero who commands an army! The people of America have borne witne&s;s to his numerous virtues; and now, we will &s;um|mon his illu&s;trious &s;hade to aid us in &s;upport of the religion which he honored, and to make tho&s;e men virtuous and good whom he was in&s;trumental of making free and happy.</P>
<P>Too often the public virtues of a great character are clouded by private views. Sometimes tho&s;e who are mo&s;t u&s;eful to the world, and who&s;e &s;olid &s;ervices and brilliant talents, compel our re&s;pect and admi|ration, prove them&s;elves in the more retired walks of life to be "weak like other men." It is happy for America, now &s;he mourns her darling &s;on, that not even the envenomed tongue of malice, battening on the faults of its neighbours, nor the rageful voice of party, more cruel than the grave it&s;elf, can a&s;&s;ail the fair fame of the man whom &s;he laments! In the dome&s;tic relations; in his private dealings; in his daily department, you always beheld him di&s;creet, amiable, dignified! He &s;hone, not with the lu&s;tre which dazzles courts and armies, but with the pu|rer, the more honorable rays of private virtue.</P>
<P>WAS it not a &s;en&s;e of religion which led our late excellent friend to acknowledge, when at the head of our armies, and more lately when he pre&s;ided in the nation, our ab&s;olute dependence upon the GOD of providence, a&s;cribing the honor of his victories and our deliverance to him who "&s;etteth up one
<PB N="12" REF="038618_0011_1012A84663E56848">
and putteth down another!" In his public in&s;tru|ments; in his la&s;t precious legacy to his country, and in his private conver&s;ation he expre&s;&s;ed the deep|e&s;t reverence for the infinite and eternal being who is "in all and over all, and by whom all things con|&s;i&s;t." His con&s;tant attendance on the chri&s;tian church, his reverend ob&s;ervation of the LORD's Day&punc; as well as his whole behaviour, demon&s;trated his be|lief in the religion of the Cro&s;s.</P>
<P>"HE that is &s;low to anger is better than the migh|ty, and he that ruleth his &s;pirit than he that taketh a city." Never does a man appear &s;o truly great as when he &s;ubdues tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which infuriate others, and hurry them to the mo&s;t fatal exce&s;&s;es. And here our beloved chief di&s;covered true great|ne&s;s, and placed before our eyes an illu&s;trious exam|ple. His mildne&s;s, his patience, his impartial be|nignity enabled him to controul the pa&s;&s;ions of oth|ers, and reconcile contending intere&s;ts. His &s;elf command enabled him to rule tho&s;e who did not po&s;&s;e&s;s their own minds. A re&s;erve, partly the gift of nature and partly the effect of prudent habit, pre|vented him from betraying his own purpo&s;es, or ex|pre&s;&s;ing &s;udden and un&s;uitable feelings. His pa|tient endurance of wrong from the envious and the mi&s;taken, made him their &s;uperior, and converted his enemies into friends. The enemies of his country I mean; per&s;onal enemies he had none.</P>
<P>"HE that walketh uprightly, walketh &s;urely." The ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, the favor of men, and the te&s;ti|mony of a good con&s;cience are the con&s;equences of an hone&s;t and faithful di&s;charge of our duty. The&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="038618_0012_1012A847F5620BD0">
con&s;equences of his integrity did our late excellent Pre&s;ident enjoy. Neither wealth nor flattery nor clamour nor violence could corrupt his heart, or de|tach him from his duty. Hone&s;tly did he exert his whole power and influence to &s;erve his country, nor can an in&s;tance be produced of his having neglected its concerns, or betrayed its intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>IT it is recorded of NAAMAN that "by him GOD gave deliverance to Syria." And him whom we mention in our lamentations this day, GOD made the principal agent in giving freedom and deliverance to America. A &s;oldier in early life, when he was high|ly u&s;eful to his native province, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a cool judgment and a determined courage. Without the ardent impetuo&s;ity, the furious valour which &s;ome|times give &s;ucce&s;s to folly and pro&s;perity to inju&s;tice, he was intrepidly brave. His love of liberty, his well known military talents, led the venerable band of patriots, who, at the commencement of the revolu|tion, conducted our councils, to con&s;ign to him the chief command of the American forces. Many of us remember this period, when at the hazard of his life and fortune, he fir&s;t headed our feeble armies.&mdash; "Gallant mortal"&mdash;how did our &s;ouls love and honor him when fir&s;t we beheld him on yonder plains flying to the relief of the oppre&s;&s;ed, and de|fending the freedom of his country! How anxiou&s;ly did we watch his foot&s;teps through the dangers of our revolution, and how did our hearts warm with gratitude to heaven and to him, when we found that the &s;oldier had not de&s;troyed the citizen; that the lu&s;t of power which led &s;o many generals, the CAE|SARS
<PB N="14" REF="038618_0013_1012A84C8FA8F4F8">
of old and the CROMWELLS of later days, to de&s;troy their country and advance them&s;elves, had no exi&s;tence in his noble bo&s;om; but that he could cheerfully re&s;ign his brilliant and flattering com|mand, and &s;eek the &s;hades of private life!&mdash;Thither did he mode&s;tly retire from the applau&s;es of his country and the world, and &s;hook from his venera|ble brow the laurels which oppre&s;&s;ed him!</P>
<P>TO &s;uch a man it was &s;elf denial to leave the hap|pine&s;s and the &s;ecurity of private life, and again to enter on the fatigues and hazards of elevated &s;ta|tion.&mdash;But the call of his country General WASH|INGTON never declined. The unanimous &s;uffra|ges of his fellow citizens (an election without a parallel in the hi&s;tory of the world) &s;elected him to admini&s;ter the free and excellent con&s;titution of government which he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in forming. In the cabinet he &s;hone equally as in the field. The intere&s;ts of the Union and of the &s;everal States he guarded with the tendere&s;t care. Our foreign rela|tions he conducted with a temperate firmne&s;s which defeated the de&s;igns of faction, cru&s;hed the efforts of rebellion, and prevented us from being fatally affec|ted with the convul&s;ions which have &s;haken Europe to its centre, and agitated the whole world!</P>
<P>LIKE JOSHUA, the brave leader of I&s;rael to inde|pendence and Canaan; like DAVID, the intrepid de|fender of his country; our late illu&s;trious chief when, with manly dignity and patriotic affection he retired from the chair of government, left a legacy the mo&s;t valuable and important to his country. While we are governed by the moral and religious
<PB N="15" REF="038618_0014_1012A853676AE588">
principles, and pre&s;erve the policy with re&s;pect to our internal and external affairs which he recom|mends, we &s;hall be free and happy. When we leave them to adopt other principles and maxims, we &s;hall de&s;erve any con&s;equences which may take place.</P>
<P>NO man's character is fully a&s;certained till his death. And happy is he who dies as he has lived in the exerci&s;e of firmne&s;s of &s;pirit and benevolence of heart. So died our beloved friend! Without the &s;ickne&s;s and long debility which &s;ometimes pre|cede death; in the full exerci&s;e of rea&s;on, of hu|manity and patrioti&s;m, he &s;uddenly encountered the univer&s;al conqueror. He &s;ubmitted, for re&s;i&s;tance was vain!&mdash;But nobly, and like a hero he &s;ubmit|ted!&mdash;Great in his la&s;t moments, with his own hands he clo&s;ed his own eyes, and gave up the Gho&s;t!!&mdash;Happy man! U&s;eful and beloved in life, calm and compo&s;ed in death, embalmed with the tears of thy friends and thy country, GOD <HI>did</HI> ble&s;s thee above other mortals!</P>
<P>AND now, let us make a &s;olemn pau&s;e in our lamentations, and amid&s;t our grief acknowledge the goodne&s;s of GOD in rai&s;ing up this great man, in qualifying him &s;o e&s;&s;entially for the &s;ervice of his country, and continuing him to us for &s;o ma|ny years. On this day, when we u&s;ed to celebrate his birth with warm and grateful plea&s;ure, we feel his lo&s;s mo&s;t deeply. But, how much more deep|ly &s;hould we have felt it, had he been taken from us at any period of our revolutionary war; or when the whole weight of his influence and charac|ter
<PB N="16" REF="038618_0015_1012A854F5E3AB68">
was nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve us from being involved in the confu&s;ions of the European world, or when in&s;urrection reared its hydra head, and threatened the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences?</P>
<P>BUT that GOD who has always been kind to America in rai&s;ing up from among her own &s;ons tho&s;e who "naturally care for her &s;tate" and watch|fully guard her intere&s;ts, continued his life till a period when our excellent con&s;titution is firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and the pro&s;pects of di&s;uniting and de&s;troying us are greatly weakened. While we mention WASH|INGTON in our lamentations this day, let us be thankful that &s;o many great and good men in our Federal and State Governments are &s;till &s;pared to us; men whom GOD has qualified for eminent &s;er|vice, and called to fill the mo&s;t important &s;tations. Let us be thankful for the ine&s;timable life, the un|corrupted integrity, the &s;uperior wi&s;dom, and the pure patrioti&s;m of ADAMS, the wi&s;e and the good, who now pre&s;ides over the&s;e &s;tates! May the Almigh|ty continue him for many years, to be the father of his country, and the friend of mankind!</P>
<P>LET us be deeply humbled before GOD, this day, under the frowns of his providence in taking away men &s;o great, &s;o good, &s;o u&s;eful as tho&s;e whom we have lately been called to deplore.</P>
<P>WHEN GOD removed from his ancient I&s;rael "the &s;tay and the &s;taff, the mighty man and the man of war, the prudent and the ancient, the hona|rable man and the coun&s;ellor," it was con&s;idered as a token of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, and called not only for grief but humiliation. Great and good men
<PB N="17" REF="038618_0016_1012A857EE867DF0">
are in&s;truments in the hands of GOD to effect his purpo&s;es. They accompli&s;h his will, and by them he does good to us. When they are taken away therefore, we ought to humble our&s;elves in his &s;ight. When tho&s;e by whom GOD has been u&s;ed to do good to us are removed by death, have we not rea|&s;on to fear that he means to deprive us of the good it&s;elf?</P>
<P>GOD is, we tru&s;t and hope, the guardian and friend of America, and his gracious favor is the pal|ladium of our country. Its exi&s;tence and pro&s;peri|ty do not depend upon any one man, or any num|ber of men, let them be ever &s;o wi&s;e or good. "The LORD is our defence, and the holy one of I&s;rael is our King." It is true that when we &s;u&s;tain the lo&s;s of &s;uch men as a WASHINGTON and a SUM|NER, we are con&s;trained to &s;ay, "Help LORD, for the godly man cea&s;eth, the faithful fail from among the children of men." When tho&s;e who "&s;eemed to be pillars" are removed, we feel the goodly fabric of our government &s;haken. But, "the re&s;idue of the &s;pirit is with GOD." He gave us the&s;e excel|lent men. He continued them to us as long as he &s;aw to be be&s;t. And now that he has taken them away, we will &s;ubmit to the will of Heaven, and re|ly on him who has never for&s;aken us nor our fathers.</P>
<P>BUT &s;urely when we mention the virtuous and the good in our lamentations, we &s;hould be &s;timulated to emulate their virtues, and be &s;tudious to follow their advices, founded on experience, wi&s;dom and love of their country.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="038618_0017_1012A8598BFDC360">IT is not to the parade of mourning, nor to the dictates of affectionate feeling only that we &s;hould this day attend. We ought to be made wi&s;er and better by an event &s;o affecting, and &s;ervices &s;o &s;ol|emn as we are now performing. Our civil rulers have called us to celebrate the days of mourning for our beloved friend, in order to fix deeply in our minds a reverence for his character, and a re&s;pect to the principles which he practi&s;ed him&s;elf, and in his dying legacy recommended to us. You, e&s;pe|cially, venerable fathers, who compo&s;e the executive and legi&s;lative powers of the Commonwealth: You who &s;o lately &s;olemnized the ob&s;equies of our own beloved Chief Magi&s;trate, will &s;uitably meditate on the uncertainty of human life, and the vanity of hu|man greatne&s;s. You will feel the importance of faithfully di&s;charging your whole duty, both public and private, &s;o that you may be approved of GOD, and "accepted of the multitude of your brethren." Go ye and imitate the &s;elf-command, the di&s;intere&s;t|edne&s;s, the cool wi&s;dom and warm patrioti&s;m of the man whom a nation this day laments. Go ye and &s;erve GOD, and your generation according to his will!" Go ye, continue in your uprightne&s;s, and &s;till pre&s;erve the u&s;efulne&s;s which gives us &s;ecurity and pro&s;perity!&mdash;This is an awful and a &s;olemn &s;cene! Here the &s;upreme executive power, and the high leg|i&s;lative authority of the Commonwealth, a&s;&s;emble in religious wor&s;hip, to acknowledge and adore the gov|ernor of the univer&s;e under one of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing events in his providence, and to condole each other on this melancholy di&s;pen&s;ation. All the peo|ple

of the Commonwealth unite this day in the ex|pre&s;&s;ions of their grief, and &s;ympathize with their ci|vil rulers on the great and univer&s;al bereavement! May our mourning be u&s;eful, and may we be "taught to profit by the things which we &s;uffer."</P>
<P>ON imbibing the principles recommended by our late illu&s;trious chief, equally di&s;tant from tyranny and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, depends the &s;afety of our country. If we wi&s;h to be great among the nations abroad, and to be peaceful and happy at home, we mu&s;t pre|&s;erve inviolably our union. We mu&s;t guard again&s;t improper foreign connexions. We mu&s;t maintain a &s;pirit of mutual forbearance and good will, and mu&s;t cultivate e&s;pecially tho&s;e principles of religion and morality which are the only &s;olid cement of &s;ociety, and the only firm foundation of liberty. Where GOD is neglected; where the religion of CHRIST is denied; where men are governed not by rea&s;on or religion, but by party views and furious pa&s;&s;ions, there may be the <HI>name</HI> of liberty, but the <HI>thing</HI> never can exi&s;t. If we are careful to pre&s;erve and to fo&s;ter the univer&s;ities, the &s;chools we now maintain: If we honor and re&s;pect the day and the ordinances of GOD: If we de&s;pi&s;e and neglect vice, and honor and &s;upport virtue: If we embrace the doctrines, and &s;ubmit to the precepts of the Go&s;pel, we &s;hall be a happy people, and tran&s;mit our civil and religious liberties, a fair and a large inheritance, to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>BUT while we &s;ympathize with a nation in their afflictions, let us not forget the private di&s;tre&s;&s;es which this &s;olemn event has occa&s;ioned. We mourn with
<PB N="20" REF="038618_0019_10122E40A4BA3CA8">
the de&s;olate widow, who is deprived of the "guide of her youth," the friend of her riper years, and the mo&s;t valuable of her earthly ble&s;&s;ings! Calmly and with compo&s;ure may &s;he &s;ubmit to this afflictive event; and &s;ince her attachments to earth are dimini&s;hed, may &s;he prepare to join the "de&s;ire of her eyes" in a better world! May his friends, his relatives, his do|me&s;tics, while they mourn his lo&s;s, imitate his virtues, and may none who bear his illu&s;trious name, tarni&s;h its lu&s;tre, or bring di&s;grace upon it.</P>
<P>AND now, friends and fellow-citizens, let us "cea&s;e from man who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils, for where is he to be accounted of!" If tho&s;e who are the delights of their country, and the veneration of the world: If men of the pure&s;t characters: If tho&s;e for whom prayers are continually a&s;cending, that they may be &s;pared and ble&s;&s;ed: If <HI>they</HI> are taken away: If <HI>they</HI> are laid low in the du&s;t, how &s;hall <HI>we</HI> e&s;cape this common lot of humanity! If the&s;e cedars of Lebanon, "the height whereof reacheth up to heaven, and the &s;ight thereof unto the ends of the earth:" If <HI>they</HI> bow and break, what &s;hall become of the "hy&s;&s;op which &s;pringeth out of the wall!"&mdash;Surely we are ha&s;tening to the &s;ilent tomb, "the hou&s;e appointed for all living!" We &s;hall &s;oon follow the friends whom we deplore, the wi&s;e and the good, whom we honor, through "the dark valley of the &s;hadow of death!"&mdash;Let it be therefore our mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;olicitude, to partake of the grace of the Go&s;pel, to do our whole duty, and promote the welfare and happine&s;s of our fellow|men, &s;o that when we fall a&s;leep, we may be
<PB N="21" REF="038618_0020_1012A86372649AB0">
"found of our judge in peace," and be "received into everla&s;ting habitations!"</P>
<P>AND now unto him, who is "prince of the kings of the earth," "before whom" all nations are as the drop of the bucket, and the du&s;t of the bal|ance," to the infinite, perfect, eternal mind, "the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to day, and forever," be glory and honor, dominion and power, both now and forever,</P>
