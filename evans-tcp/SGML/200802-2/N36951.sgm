<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>DAILY experience affords &s;uch numerous and melancholy in&s;tances of the fatal effects of con|tagious di&s;ea&s;es, and others more immediately within the power of medicine to remove, as render every attempt to mitigate their violence intere&s;ting to the Community at large, and the United States in particular. It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to place before our Readers <HI>facts,</HI> in order to excite their attention to the &s;ubject: Lately in this coun|try, calamity it&s;elf has been the con&s;tant com|plaint of every neighbourhood; and almo&s;t every news-paper pre&s;ents us with an example of the direful con&s;equences of infection. From this malignant &s;ource it is, that the late awful and melancholy events in our cities are principally to be attributed, and that our &s;hips become &s;cenes of exe|cution;&mdash;the enterpri&s;ing Mariner&mdash;the hardy Sol|dier&mdash;the indu&s;trious Citizen (all entitled to the care and gratitude of a mercantile and ri&s;ing republic) are daily victims to the un&s;u&s;pected in|fluence of contagion.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="048383_0006_1025501E4265AD90">IN contemplating the &s;ubject of noxious va|pours, it &s;truck me forcibly that &s;ome &s;ervice might be rendered to the public, and con&s;ide|rable improvements made by turning my at|tention to the &s;ubject of medicine-che&s;ts for naval, travelling, or dome&s;tic u&s;e, particularly the for|mer, by pointing out the means that are known by repeated experiments to po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of de&s;troying contagion, clean&s;ing infected &s;ub&s;tances, and preventing the propagation of di&s;ea&s;es, which I have never &s;een &s;ufficiently attended to in any book of directions of this kind; be&s;ides the di&s;covery of the means for that purpo&s;e, which are communicated in the following &s;heets, are of a very recent date, and not yet generally practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>WHAT avail the noble&s;t remedies that nature and art have produced for the cure of tho&s;e dreadful maladies, without devi&s;ing and applying means to de&s;troy the <HI>Fons et origo mali,</HI> (fountain and origin of evil,) and re&s;tore the purity of the atmo&s;|phere in which the patient breathes, by removing the cau&s;es which might &s;ubject him to a fatal re|lap&s;e.&mdash;Dr. Lind ob&s;erves, "Wherever infection lurks, and in whatever it is harboured, the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of the pure&s;t air, or the mo&s;t perfect ven|tilation will often not avail either in removing or abating its activity." It is to the per&s;evering
<PB N="7" REF="048383_0007_10254FDEE9D9CE60">
and unremitting attention to the be&s;t intere&s;ts of mankind, that we are indebted to the ingenious Drs. Carmichael Smith, Prie&s;tly, Ingenhouz, Beddoes, Mitchill, and others of great eminence; particularly the former gentleman for his import|ant di&s;covery, for arre&s;ting and &s;topping the progre&s;s of contagious di&s;ea&s;es, by a &s;imple ope|ration in chemi&s;try, which is in the power of every one to perform at a minutes notice.</P>
<P>As perfect ventilation and the free admi&s;&s;ion of pure air, is not always practicable on board of &s;hips, occa&s;ionally the u&s;e of &s;team will be recom|mended, by which a large portion of water being converted into vapour, which the air having a greater affinity to than for any foreign matter float|ing in it; a compleat exchange will take place, all the noxious particles will be decompo&s;ed, the di&s;agreeable &s;tench or foetor ari&s;ing from foul or di&s;ea&s;ed bodies will be precipitated, and the at|mo&s;phere of the patient rendered pure.</P>
<P>A COMPLEAT &s;y&s;tem of the practice of phy&s;ic and &s;urgery cannot be expected in the compa&s;s of the&s;e directions; neither is it intended to preclude the propriety of calling in proper medical aid, when it can be had.</P>
<P>As the medicine-che&s;ts will be equally porta|ble, and not more expen&s;ive by the additional

means here recommended; they will of cour&s;e, be rendered more exten&s;ively u&s;eful. In &s;hort, if I &s;hould be fortunate enough in this in&s;tance to contribute in the &s;malle&s;t degree to the health and comfort of Society, I &s;hall think my&s;elf amply rewarded.</P>

<HEAD><HI>MEDICAL ADVICE</HI>; Particularly to tho&s;e who travel to the various regions of the Globe.</HEAD>
<P>IT is of the utmo&s;t importance for every indivi|dual, to well under&s;tand the be&s;t methods of pre|&s;erving health, and is the duty of every well-wi&s;her to the cau&s;e of humanity, to contribute his &s;er|vices; on this principle then the following direc|tions are written.</P>
<P>IN hot weather, after u&s;ing any hard exerci&s;e, avoid drinking cold water, for it has proved fatal: but as drink is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, the water &s;hould be mixed with about one &s;eventh or eight of good old &s;pirits. To tho&s;e who are relaxed, nothing can be better than an addition to this drink of about twelve drops of acid elixir of vitriol, three or four times a day, or a &s;mall quantity of the juice of lemons or limes: but the mo&s;t whole&s;ome beverage for them who enjoy a good &s;tate of health, is good &s;ound porter or ale mixed with water.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="048383_0010_102550281DE80D38">EXCESSES of every kind &s;hould be avoided as much as po&s;&s;ible, and drunkenne&s;s in particular. No per&s;on &s;hould &s;leep at night in the open air, as it is extremely hazardous, on account of the damps.</P>
<P>IT is &s;trongly recommended to the commanders of &s;hips trading to the different parts of Africa, the Ea&s;t, and We&s;t Indies, not to permit any of their men to remain on &s;hore after &s;un&s;et.&mdash;But if from bu&s;ine&s;s, of any other unavoidable circum&s;tance, they &s;hould be &s;ent in boats, up rivers, or on &s;hore in the neighbourhood of mar&s;hy countries, a few large do&s;es of bark in powder, given in wine, may enable the con&s;titution to re&s;i&s;t the &s;edative power of the chilling and noxious damps.&mdash;Or a few do&s;es of the ague pills, which are a very powerful tonic, will an&s;wer &s;till better in places, where from the rain and fogs, the con&s;titution may be &s;aid to be con&s;tantly in a vapour bath.</P>
<P>IN order to prevent injuries from the bite of <HI>mu&s;quetoes, hor&s;e-flies,</HI> and other in&s;ects, as they &s;ometimes produce inflammations and ulcers in the legs, and even mortifications; wear long light linen trow&s;ers. The be&s;t remedy for the inflammation ari&s;ing from the&s;e cau&s;es, is the juice of a lime, &s;harp vinegar, Goulard's extract of lead and water, or &s;pirit of harts-horn and water.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="048383_0011_10254FE4E9E88400">WHEN the water is bad or putrid, it may be &s;weetened in the following manner: Expo&s;e it to the air as much as po&s;&s;ible, by pumping it with a hand pump from one ve&s;&s;el into another, mixing a little powdered charcoal or a &s;mall por|tion of alum, which will throw down particles of dirt, clear the water, and its whole&s;omene&s;s will not be in the &s;lighte&s;t degree impaired.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. OTSBRIDGE's method of &s;weetening &s;uch water is the quicke&s;t, which is by pa&s;&s;ing it through a &s;eries of ve&s;&s;els, placed under each other, having very &s;mall holes bored in their bottoms, &s;o that it may fall in &s;mall drops, like a gentle &s;hower of rain, through each of them into a receiver fixed below. The wind, or air, having thus a free pa&s;&s;age through the water, divided into &s;mall drops, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;oon render it whole&s;ome and &s;weet.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN long voyages, beef, pork, &amp;c. is frequently apt to become &s;tale.&mdash;"In Mr. Gaine's almanac for 1797, there is a good Receipt, by which any meat, ever &s;o &s;tinking, may be made as &s;weet and whole&s;ome in a few minutes, as any meat at all. The Receipt is as follows: Take &s;ome white ley, that is, boil &s;ome clean a&s;hes in water; let it &s;tand till it &s;ettles; pour this off as clear as rock water; boil your meat in this three or four minutes, or till it is &s;weet, then wa&s;h it and dre&s;s it in any way, and no per|&s;on could di&s;cover it had ever been foetid or &s;tink|ing. This will be found a u&s;eful communication to the navy, where a &s;olution of pot-a&s;h may be u&s;ed in&s;tead of the white ley."</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="048383_0012_102550299FEDB8A8">"WE find that a few pails full of this ley or &s;olution of pot-a&s;h, will re&s;tore to eatable con|dition, a barrel of &s;tinking meat, which by <HI>the operation of the pot-a&s;h,</HI> is re&s;tored to a &s;ound &s;tate."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">VIDE the ca&s;e of the Manufacturers of Soap and Candles.</NOTE></P>
<P>FOR the mo&s;t part &s;mall <HI>grog,</HI> that is, liquor unit|ed to a con&s;iderable quantity of water, is the drink, and through nece&s;&s;ity &s;alt provi&s;ions are the diet. Neither this diet, nor the liquor, produce di&s;|ea&s;es, unle&s;s the water &s;hould be very putrid, which will &s;ometimes, in hot climates, occa&s;ion fevers of the malignant kind, and fluxes; and by the &s;ea air, through the imprudence of the men &s;leeping on the deck, are pleuri&s;ies, peripneu|monies, and other inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es produced. &mdash;The Guinea-worm, I believe is peculiar to Afri|ca, and a few parts of A&s;ia. It has been &s;uppo|&s;ed to proceed from a bad quality in the water of the country; doubtle&s;s the waters of Senegal, Gam|bia, Sierra Leon, Ganges, &amp;c. are either unwhole|&s;ome or muddy; &s;uppo&s;ing with Lind and others, that the Guinea-worm is generated from ani|malcula, or their ova, contained in the waters of the country; their production in the human body, may probably be prevented, by drinking good water.&mdash;"The Guinea-worm is a white, round, &s;lender worm, often &s;ome yards long, lodged in the inter&s;tices of the mu&s;cles (or fle&s;h), com|monly
<PB N="13" REF="048383_0013_10254FE7C141D6A0">
in the legs, feet, or hands; when it attempts to e&s;cape through the &s;kin, it occa&s;ions a &s;welling, re&s;embling a boil, attended with great pain, until its black head appears in a &s;mall watery bladder on the head of the bile. When this bladder breaks, the head of the worm is to be &s;ecured, by tying it to a &s;mall roll of linen, &s;pread with plai&s;ter; and part of the worm is once or twice a day to be gently drawn forth, with care not to break it, and wrapped round this roll, un|til it be brought away entire; then the ulcer gene|rally heals &s;oon; but if part of the worm breaks off, the part remaining in the fle&s;h, can be ejected only by painful and tedious &s;uppuration in different places. Dr. Rouppe ob&s;erves, that the Guinea|worm is infectious. It may at lea&s;t be prudent, not to lie in the &s;ame apartment, and to avoid too free a communication with &s;uch negroes as are afflicted with them."</P>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to give directions how to exhibit the medicines contained in the medicine-|che&s;t, our attention &s;hall be directed to the means pointed out by Dr. Lind, for preventing a want of provi&s;ions at &s;ea, and clo&s;e our remarks with &s;ome general ob&s;ervations re&s;pecting diet, more properly adapted to dome&s;tic u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="048383_0014_1025502B248C7DB8">"THE &s;ub&s;tances I have found mo&s;t fit for the purpo&s;e are powder of &s;alep and portable &s;oup, which convey the greate&s;t quantity of vegetable and animal nouri&s;hment under the &s;malle&s;t bulk. An ounce of powdered &s;alep, and another of portable &s;oup, di&s;&s;ol|ved in two quarts of boiling water, become a rich thick jelly, capable of receiving any flavour from the addition of &s;pices. This is &s;ufficient for one man a day; two pounds of each would &s;erve him a month: and being a mixture of both animal and vegetable food, it is more whole&s;ome than either u&s;ed alone. Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t informs us, that a cara|van from Ethiopia to Egypt, having expended their provi&s;ions, lived for two months on gum arabic, di&s;&s;olved in water; this gum having luckily been a part of their merchandize. The gum &s;enega or ara|bic, &s;erves as a &s;u&s;tenance for whole negro towns, during a &s;carcity of other provi&s;ions, occa&s;ioned by a failure of their crops of millet and rice.</P>
<P>SPICES render portable &s;oup and &s;alep, more grateful to the palate, and al&s;o tend to improve their nutritive quality; as would appear from the following incident of famine on board a &s;hip at &s;ea: A Malay &s;hip arrived from Maca&s;&s;ar, at Manilla, which by the &s;hifting of the mon&s;oon, had been detained at &s;ea much longer than was expected, the men had been reduced to &s;uch extremities for want
<PB N="15" REF="048383_0015_10254FE9447D0858">
of provi&s;ions, as to be obliged to &s;ub&s;i&s;t for two months, almo&s;t wholly upon water and &s;pices; the latter, viz. cinnamon, mace, and pepper, being the cargo of the &s;hip, notwith&s;tanding which, upon their arrival at Manilla, they all, the number of thir|ty, were in perfect health."</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS re&s;pecting DIET, more pro|perly adapted to dome&s;tic u&s;e&mdash;particularly in ca&s;es of indi&s;po&s;ition or &s;ickne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>PERSONS of imflammatory di&s;po&s;ition, cannot u&s;e vegetables too plentifully. Oat-meal is cool|ing, therefore made into gruel, affords a light and proper diet for the &s;ick, &s;o are &s;ago, &s;imo|lina, and tapioca, u&s;ed in general, in various di&s;ea&s;es, where &s;uch diet is nece&s;&s;ary; and in all fevers, where animal food &s;hould be generally avoided. From the fine&s;t wheat flour is made macaroni, vermicelle, &amp;c. as they are called in Italy, which may be boiled in water, and affords excellent nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>THOSE who&s;e health is impaired, would do well to be cautious in the choice of their food; veal, poultry, mutton well boiled, and fi&s;h are extremely nutritive, oy&s;ters eaten from the &s;hell are excel|lent.</P>
<P>MILK is friendly and nutritive, requiring little or no exertion, to prepare for chyle, &s;o are eggs, if
<PB N="16" REF="048383_0016_1025502E2AF96B48">
care be taken they are not boiled hard; beef-tea is good, and with prudence roa&s;t beef may be tried, and if it &s;its ea&s;y, may be taken in change&mdash;hard, &s;alted, and dried meats mu&s;t be avoided. Fun|gu&s;&s;es, &s;uch as truffles, mu&s;hroons, morilles, cham|pignons, &amp;c. &amp;c. are apt to tumify the &s;tomach, e&s;pecially of the delicate in con&s;titution, and de|bilitated; from whence <HI>anxiety, heart-burn, cholics, hiccups.</HI> Sometimes they have been retained three or four days undige&s;ted in the &s;tomach, occa&s;ioning the mo&s;t violent pains and mi&s;ery. Their juices are not liable to the &s;ame objections, &s;hould be ex|tracted, and their &s;olid parts, which are as tough as leather, &s;hould be thrown away. E&s;culent vege|tables which are eaten raw, with vinegar, oil, and &s;alt, are called &s;alads.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>VIRTUES.</HEAD>
<P>SALLADS are &s;aponaceous, detergent, cooling, and anti&s;eptic; opening and diuretic, and, from the addition of vinegar, they become a grateful &s;ti|mulant for the &s;tomach.&mdash;From hence they excite appetite; correct an atrabilious alcaline, putrid, &s;corbutic diathe&s;is; they liberate the tongue, &s;tomach, inte&s;tines and kidneys from &s;ordes; they cool the blood in &s;ummer, and re&s;olve ob&s;tructions of the liver, and other vi&s;cera. They agree with

the &s;edentary, &s;corbutic, and bilious, &s;anguineous; the heated, e&s;pecially in hot climates or in the &s;um|mer heat; provided they do not di&s;order the &s;tomach by their &s;low dige&s;tion, or flatulency. They are im|proper and injurious to the cold, debilitated, and nervous, and all tho&s;e who have acidity in the &s;to|mach, or inert bile.</P>
<P>THOSE who eat large quantities of cucumbers, are in general &s;ubject to fluxes, and other &s;tomach and inte&s;tinal di&s;orders.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>FRUITS.</HEAD>
<P>THEY re&s;i&s;t the putrid tendency of the humours and bile, by their abounding with fixed air. By their acidulous ta&s;te they quench thir&s;t, moderate heat, and cool. They agree mo&s;t with &s;ummer heat, and in hot climates they mo&s;t abound.&mdash; Care &s;hould be taken not to eat them immode|rately, as they will produce di&s;agreeable con&s;equen|ces, pretty generally known.</P>

little fixed air; and, if examined by a chemical analy&s;is, exhibits no heterogenous principle; which is known, if by adding the acid of &s;ugar, by a fix|ed and a nitrous &s;olution of &s;ilver. Little or no turbidne&s;s appears; for water perfectly pure, is &s;carce found in any part of the world.

<HEAD>OF BEER, ALE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ALL new ales, and &s;mall beer, are flatulent and fattening. Ale, and porter, are very good &s;trength|ening malt liquors, for tho&s;e who u&s;e hard exer|ci&s;e.</P>
<P>THOSE who accu&s;tom them&s;elves to drink malt-liquor in moderation, &s;carcely ever have the gout; but its immoderate u&s;e produces corpulency, and &s;ometimes drop&s;y.</P>
<P>BEER if not very &s;trong, is le&s;s heating than wine; it is a nouri&s;hing and analeptic drink; hence proper for the feeble and emaciated, if they labour under coughs or difficulty of breathing. In many where wine &s;ours in the &s;tomach, beer or good ale will agree; if it be well hopped, it is &s;aid to prevent the gravel, gout, or &s;tone.</P>

<P>AFTER the purgatives had operated &s;ufficiently, if the head ache was not relieved, a bli&s;ter was applied to the neck; per&s;piration was encouraged, by giving warm drinks; and three or four grains of calomel was given in a pill, every four or &s;ix hours. To this opium was &s;ometimes added, (twenty or thirty drops of the tincture) when the purging had a tendency to run to exce&s;s.</P>
<P>A BLISTER applied over the &s;tomach, generally checked the vomiting, when employed early in the di&s;ea&s;e. When there was little or no inclination to vo|mit, Dr. C. added a proportion, viz. from half a grain to one or two grains of the antimonial powder (No. 27) to the calomel; and pills with this combination were gi|ven every &s;econd or third hour, till they had &s;ome effect. A grain or two of opium, or twenty five to thirty five drops of the tincture was afterwards given, to &s;ettle the &s;tomach and procure &s;leep. If the medicine operated plentifully by &s;tool before the opium was admini&s;tered, and a profu&s;e per&s;piration followed, the fever was carried off in twenty four hours, and the patient recovered. The antimonial when conjoined with calomel, rarely occa&s;ioned vomiting, their effects were commonly to procure a few &s;tools, and to excite per&s;piration. And although vomiting in this fever is very much to be dreaded, yet in all ca&s;es con&s;idered as de&s;perate, this combination ought to be tried.</P>
<P>AFTER the febrile &s;tage, three or four grains of calomel were given every four hours to an adult, and a gla&s;s of &s;trong decoction of bark, was ordered every hour in the intervals, with as much nouri&s;hment and wine as the &s;tomach could bear, given in &s;mall quantities frequently repeated. This plan was con|tinued for thirty-&s;ix or forty-eight hours after the febrile &s;tate was over a &s;light &s;alivation or &s;pitting rarely took place; but the gums we are told, were &s;ometimes a little aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cted about the third day. When that happened, both mercury and every other remedy was &s;u&s;pended, and nouri&s;hment and wine only given.</P>
<P>Dr. C's method of prevention is on arrival a few calomel purges, in the cour&s;e of the fir&s;t ten days, with a vegetable diet, and the moderate u&s;e of wine, together with peruvian bark for &s;everal days after, and the renewal of the calo|mel purges and bark from time to time, during the fir&s;t two or three months re&s;idence, was the mo&s;t common method employed to prevent an attack, and it was generally &s;ucce&s;sful.</P></NOTE>

<HEAD>FRACTURED LIMBS.</HEAD>
<P>FRACTURES are of various kinds, viz. Tran&s;|ver&s;e, oblique, and longitudinal. When a bone is &s;plit into &s;mall pieces, it is &s;aid to be &s;plintered, they are al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by different names; thus, when the &s;oft parts remain &s;ound, the fracture is denominated &s;imple; when attended with a wound, communicating with the fracture, it is termed compound. Fractures are di&s;covered by the eye, the ear, and the touch. The &s;ymptoms are pain, &s;welling, and ten&s;ion in the contiguous parts; a more or le&s;s crooked and di&s;torted &s;tate of the limb, a crackling or grating noi&s;e on the parts being
<PB N="48" REF="048383_0048_1025505D2776C880">
handled, and lo&s;s of power to a certain extent in the injured limb.</P>
<P>THE indications of cure, are to replace the parts of the bone that have been removed from their na|tural &s;ituation, to retain them in this &s;ituation as long as may be nece&s;&s;ary. In order to replace the parts of the bones, a &s;light degree of exten&s;ion may be employed by the upper part of the limb, be|ing kept firm by an a&s;&s;i&s;tant with his hands placed between the fracture and the contiguous joint, while the under part of it is gently extended by another, ob&s;erving to keep the mu&s;cles as much relaxed as po&s;&s;ible. If there is very great ten&s;ion and inflam|mation, they mu&s;t be removed before the replacing of the bone is attempted, by the means recom|mended in brui&s;es, &s;prains, &amp;c.</P>
<P>TO retain the bones when replaced, compre&s;&s;es, bandages, and a relaxed &s;tate of the limb till the cure is compleated, are nece&s;&s;ary. The bandage mu&s;t not be applied with more tightne&s;s than is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to retain the bones in their &s;ituation, a linen or flannel roller is the be&s;t for this purpo&s;e. In a healthy middle aged per&s;on, a &s;imple fracture of the thigh, or bones of the leg, will require about two months for the cure. The humerus and bones of the forearm about &s;ix weeks; the collar bone, ribs, and bones of the fingers and toes, hands and feet, about three weeks. In infancy, the cure is effected in le&s;s time, but in old age the proce&s;s is more &s;low; to reduce the fracture of the collar bone, it is
<PB N="49" REF="048383_0049_1025508AEEE87FC8">
only nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e the arm, and &s;upport it at a proper height; which is done by a &s;ling round the neck, adapted to the length of the arm, and appli|ed equally to every part of it&mdash;the bones are gene|rally united in a fortnight; but the corre&s;ponding arm &s;hould not be u&s;ed until the end of the third or fourth week.</P>
<P>FRACTURES of the ribs, are di&s;covered by the &s;eat of the pain, and by pre&s;&s;ure of the fingers. In general the &s;ymptoms are moderate, but in &s;ome in&s;tances the pain is &s;evere from the fir&s;t, the breathing is difficult, attended with cough and &s;ometimes &s;pitting of blood; the pul&s;e is quick, full, and &s;ometimes oppre&s;&s;ed. In every ca&s;e of fractured ribs, bleed proportionably to the &s;trength of the patient. If any inequality is di&s;covered, let the patient make a deep in&s;piration, and by equal and moderate pre&s;&s;ure, endeavour to replace it; and to prevent its ri&s;ing, apply a broad roller, or a leather belt quilted in&s;ide, with cotton or flan|nel, moderately tight, and let it be worn for &s;everal weeks&mdash;the diet mu&s;t be low.</P>

<HEAD>DISLOCATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal indications of cure, are to re|&s;tore the luxated part; and &s;econdly, to retain it in its proper &s;ituation. But if inflammation, or tumour, are con&s;iderable, they &s;hould be removed by bleeding, and application of Goulard's extract of lead and water.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="048383_0050_1025505EAAE4A6E0">IN reducing luxations, the mu&s;cles &s;hould be put into a &s;tate of the greate&s;t relaxation by bending the limb. The exten&s;ion &s;hould be gradual and continued, until the di&s;lo-cated bone is on a level with the cavity, or &s;ocket from whence it receded; at which time, if the head does not return of it&s;elf, it mu&s;t be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by pre&s;&s;ing upon it, and making a lever of the di&s;located bone.</P>

<HEAD>Recovery of Su&s;pended Re&s;piration, or Per&s;ons Appa|rently Dead by Drowning, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST, in removing the body, great care &s;hould be taken that it be not brui&s;ed, &s;haken violently, roughly handled, nor carried over any one's &s;houl|ders with the head hanging downwards, nor rolled upon the deck, or over a barrel, nor lifted up by the heels: for experience proves that all the&s;e me|thods are injurious, and often de&s;troy the &s;mall remains of life. The body &s;hould be cautiou&s;ly carried in the arms of two or more per&s;ons with the head a little rai&s;ed and kept in as ea&s;y a po&s;ition as po&s;&s;ible.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P N="1">1. WHEN the body is taken out of the water, &s;trip and wrap it clo&s;ely in a coat, blanket, or other warm covering; and convey it to the neare&s;t com|modious hou&s;e,&mdash;keeping the face upwards and the head and &s;houlders a lit|tle rai&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2">2. LAY it on a bed, or mattra&s;s, that is well heated by a warming pan, in a chamber containing a fire;&mdash;or, during very hot weather, place it in the &s;un|&s;hine. Dry the body completely with warm cloths, and afterwards rub it diligently, but <HI>gently,</HI> with hot flannels, all over, and e&s;pecially about the heart.&mdash;Apply to the hands, feet, and under the arm pits, cloths heated by a warming pan, bags of hot grains or &s;and, heated bricks or bottles filled, or bladders half filled, with warm water,&mdash;the bricks or bottles being covered with flannel.&mdash;As &s;oon as a quantity of hot water can be got ready, let blan|kets or flannels &s;trongly wrung out of it, be wrapped round the body, and re|newed as they grow cool.</P>
<P>N. B. THE heat of the&s;e applications &s;hould not be greater than can be com|fortably borne by the a&s;&s;i&s;tants.</P>
<P N="3">3. DURING the foregoing operations, put the pipe of a pair of bellows into one of the no&s;trils (the other no&s;tril and mouth being clo&s;ed by an a&s;&s;i&s;tant,) and blow gently till the brea&s;t be a little rai&s;ed: let the mouth then be le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> free, and an ea&s;y pre&s;&s;ure made on the brea&s;t.&mdash;Repeat this imitation of natural breathing, until &s;igns of life appear, and then gradually di&s;continue it.&mdash;To prevent air getting into the &s;tomach, let an a&s;&s;i&s;tant keep pre&s;&s;ing the upper part of the wind-pipe gently backwards.</P>
<P>N. B. IF the pipe of the bellows will not enter the no&s;tril, a piece of &s;tiff paper, or leather, may be rolled up in the &s;hape of a funnel, and the &s;maller end put into the no&s;tril, while the other receives the pipe of the bellows.&mdash;Or if bellows are not at hand, blow into the lungs through &s;uch a tube, or through a quill, reed, or other &s;mall pipe, with your breath.</P>
<P N="4">4. WHEN breathing begins, touch the in&s;ide of the no&s;trils, with a feather dipt in &s;pirir of hart&s;horn or &s;harp mu&s;tard; or blow &s;ome pepper into them. A gly&s;ter &s;hould now be given without delay, compo&s;ed of a pint of warm water mixed with a &s;ixth part of rum, brandy, or gin, or with a large table &s;poon|ful of &s;pirit of hart&s;horn, or e&s;&s;ence of peppermint, or a heaped tea&s;poo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful of flour of mu&s;tard.</P>
<P N="5">5. As &s;oon as the patient can &s;wallow, give him by &s;poonfuls, a little warm wine, or &s;pirits <HI>mixed with water.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. WHEN life is completely re&s;tored, the &s;ufferer &s;hould remain at re&s;t in a warm bed; be &s;upplied with warm wine whey, ale, po&s;&s;et, or other nouri&s;hing drinks; and gentle &s;weating &s;hould be encouraged.</P>
<P>N. B. The&s;e attentions &s;hould be continued until the patient is out of all danger, &s;everal per&s;ons having been lo&s;t from being quitted too &s;oon.</P>
<P>No more than <HI>&s;ix</HI> per&s;ons to be admitted into the room; a greater number &s;erving only to &s;poil the air and to create confu&s;ion and mi&s;takes.</P>
<P><HI>Hanging.</HI>&mdash;1. If a medical per&s;on be pre&s;ent, let him take a few ounces of blood from the jugular veins, or apply cupping-gla&s;&s;es to the neck.</P>
<P>The other means to be the &s;ame as recommened for drowned per&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Suffocation by Noxious Vapours.</HI>&mdash;2. If the body be hot, &s;trip and lay it in the open air, with the head and &s;houlders rai&s;ed. Then da&s;h cold water upon it, until &s;igns of life appear; taking care that none get into the mouth or no&s;trils. At the &s;ame time blow into the lungs as ordered in drowned per&s;ons.&mdash;If the body has grown cold, then warmth mu&s;t be applied.</P>
<P><HI>Fro&s;t-bitten, or Frozen.</HI>&mdash;At fir&s;t rub the parts affected, or the whole body with &s;now; or wa&s;h them with cold water;&mdash;but not near a fire, or in a warm place; it being of great con&s;equence that the heat be communicated very gra|dually.&mdash;If the breathing has &s;topped, blow into the lungs as already de&s;cribed: and when recovery takes place, be cautious of giving &s;piritous liquors, except in very &s;mall quantities, and well lowered with water.</P>
<P><HI>Still-born, or Smothered under Bed-clothes.</HI>&mdash;1. In ca&s;es of &s;till-birth, fill the lungs with air, by blowing into the no&s;tril or mouth through a quill, then gently pre&s;s the che&s;t with the hand; and repeat this till natural breathing be|gins.&mdash;Al&s;o rub the body gently with the warm hand, before a fire; put it into the warm bath; or wrap it in flannels well wrung out of water moderately warmed;and &s;timulate the no&s;trils with &s;pirit of hart&s;horn or mu&s;tard.</P>
<P N="2">2. When a child has been &s;mothered in bed by overlaying, &amp;c. if (as is ge|nerally the ca&s;e) the body be too hot, expo&s;e it immediately to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rrent of air for a &s;hort time; al&s;o blow into the lungs, and u&s;e gentle frictions.</P>
<P>No other means than tho&s;e here recommended, are ever to be u&s;ed, except under the immediate direction of a medical gentleman; but the above means are to be continued <HI>&s;ix</HI> hours, if needful.</P>
<P><HI>Poi&s;on.</HI>&mdash;Until medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance can be procured, endeavour to produce vomiting, by giving large draughts of warm milk or water, mixed with oil, melted butter or lard.</P>
<P>An IMPORTANT, PUBLIC, and HUMANE CAUTION. &mdash; In great &s;inking of the &s;trength, e&s;pecially in the end of <HI>fevers</HI> and other <HI>acute di&s;|ea&s;es,</HI> patients frequently lie in a &s;tate <HI>re&s;embling death.</HI> If the bed clothes be removed, the heat of the body will be immediately di&s;&s;ipated, and every &s;park of life de&s;troyed. By not attending to this important circum&s;tance, it is fear|ed the lives of thou&s;ands of our fellow creatures have been &s;acrificed, and their bodies committed to the grave;&mdash;who, by a more humane conduct, would have been re&s;tored to life.</P>
<Q><L>Death may u&s;urp on Nature many hours,</L>
<L>And yet the fire of Life kindle again</L>
<L>The o'er-prest &s;pirits.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE></P>
<P>SECONDLY, the body is to be placed on a bed or mattra&s;s, with the head a little elevated; if wet
<PB N="51" REF="048383_0051_1025508DCC7F14D8">
&s;hould be gently dried with cloths, but in &s;uch a cautious manner, as to prevent the mechanical effect of friction, from propelling the blood towards the heart. Five or &s;ix ounces of brandy, &s;pirits, or &s;ome other warm aromatic, &s;hould be thrown into
<PB N="52" REF="048383_0052_10255061830E2A60">
the &s;tomach. If the patient &s;eems plethoric, and more particularly if the di&s;ea&s;e has been occa&s;ioned by hanging, bleeding &s;hould be employed, and that as one of the fir&s;t remedies; nor &s;hould the
<PB N="53" REF="048383_0053_10255090D5EC2EC0">
application of a proper degree of warmth be ne|glected. Bottles with hot water, or bricks heated, wrapped in a blanket, &s;hould be laid to the bottom of the feet; the joints of the knees, and under the arm-pits. Fre&s;h air &s;hould be carefully admitted into the place where he lays. If an electrical ma|chine, is at hand, gentle &s;hocks may be directed through the fourth or fifth rib of the left &s;ide. In|flate the lungs by blowing air into them by a curved pipe if one can be had, otherwi&s;e by a per&s;on blow|ing air into the lungs, and pre&s;&s;ing it out again, &s;o as to imitate natural re&s;piration. Electricity &s;hould never be employed on any account, without a concomitant expan&s;ion of the lungs. Tobacco, in any form is highly pernicious, and ought not therefore to be applied on any account.</P>
<P>INFLATING the lungs, electrifying the heart, col|lap&s;ing the lungs, and the application of frictions, are to be continued four hours, if our endeavours be not previou&s;ly crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. Frictions &s;hould never be employed before the lungs have been &s;everal times expanded and collap&s;ed. A little common oil or lard as a medium for the fric|tion, is preferable to either &s;alt or &s;pirits, or any other &s;timulating &s;ub&s;tance. The above methods of re&s;toring life are applicable to various other cau&s;es of apparent death, whether from fits, &s;uf|focation by damps, or noxious vapours, from the confined air of wells, &amp;c.</P>
<P>P. S. FOR making the common bread poultice, water is decidedly preferable to milk.</P>
