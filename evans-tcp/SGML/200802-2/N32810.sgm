<P>WAS it then re&s;erved for a &s;tranger to your per&s;ons, and your altars, to addre&s;s you on this happy re&s;toration of your public wor|&s;hip? this &s;olemn re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of your religious a&s;&s;emblies? Was it to have been the good fortune of one, to whom you were unknown, but by your &s;ufferings, to be among the fir&s;t of the Mini|&s;ters of God, to bring the comfort and con&s;olation of his word to an afflicted and per&s;ecuted people? to tell them, that he has not forgotten his "loving kindne&s;&s;es of old;" that however he &s;eemed re&s;olved to "cha&s;ten them in his di&s;plea&s;ure; to ca&s;t off his altar and abhor his &s;anc|tuary; to cau&s;e the &s;olemn fea&s;ts and &s;abbaths to be for|gotten,"

and, "in the indignation of his wrath, to eject the King and the Prie&s;t;" that however he &s;uffers "their city to be left de&s;olate and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, and every hou&s;e &s;hut up, &s;o that no man may come in: yet that he will "return again in his mercy, in his appointed time, to have compa&s;&s;ion upon his afflicted, to comfort his oppre&s;&s;ed," and to "bring them again every man to his heritage, and every man to his land; to &s;ay to the pri&s;oners, Go forth, and to them that are in darkne&s;s, Shew your&s;elves; to re&s;tore their Princes as at the fir&s;t, and their coun&s;ellers as at the beginning, and again to give them prie&s;ts according to his heart?" Let it be my fir&s;t care to ble&s;s his holy name, for having permitted me to join with your retur|ning clergy in the di&s;charge of this plea&s;ing office. They al&s;o will add their prai&s;es to mine. You, my brethren, will not be wanting in gratitude and thankfulne&s;s to the God of your redemption, and the united voice of prie&s;ts and people will be&mdash;"it is good that a man &s;hould both hope, and quietly wait, for the &s;alvation of the Lord." His ways are in&s;crutable, but his goodne&s;s certain. and without bounds.</P>
<P>Who that was witne&s;s of the cruel and di&s;a&s;trous deed of the night before la&s;t, could promi&s;e him&s;elf, that you &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled this day in the hou&s;e of God, to prai&s;e him for your wonderful deliverance? Who could have hoped that this temple would remain a monument of the returning favour of heaven, amid&s;t the horror of the ruins through which you mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed to approach it? Which of you could have &s;aid to him&s;elf, that he &s;hould &s;ee the&s;e doors opened once more for the reception of the faithful, "though as yet but as the &s;haking of an olive tree, and the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done?" Or hear the&s;e walls, &s;o long &s;ilent and unfrequented, filled again with the prai&s;es of Him, to who&s;e name you had rai&s;ed them? Is not this the Lord's doing? Is not this our God for "whom we have waited? We have waited for him, he hath &s;aved us, and we will be glad and rejoice in his &s;alvation."</P>

which the&s;e different &s;en&s;ations of joy and grief, &s;o rapidily &s;ucceeding each other within the&s;e few days pa&s;t, mu&s;t naturally have rai&s;ed in your brea&s;ts. When the heart, long oppre&s;&s;ed, and clo&s;ed in affliction, is &s;uddenly opened to the impre&s;&s;ions of joy, only to be overwhelmed as &s;uddenly with an additional weight of &s;orrow and di&s;|may, the tumult within, mu&s;t be too violent to leave much room for calm and u&s;eful reflections. It &s;hall there|fore be my bu&s;ine&s;s to endeavour to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch thoughts as appear &s;uitable to this extraordinary occa&s;ion, and to regulate your pre&s;ent affections, in a manner that be&s;t be|comes the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t. This has never been, and I am confident never will be, the pulpit of contention or &s;trife. No "prophets, prophe&s;ying lyes in the name of the Lord who &s;ent them not," &s;hall ever turn it into a &s;tage for &s;edition. The words of truth and life will never be perverted here in promoting violence and blood&s;head, un|der pretence of con&s;ulting the intere&s;ts of the God of peace to cau&s;e the religion of the lowly, mild, and meek Je&s;us, to &s;peak the language of ambition, &s;laughter and revenge or to con&s;ecrate and deliver out in his name the &s;word that is to be plunged by his followers into each others brea&s;t. Thanks be to the Lord "we have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t." We will neither abu&s;e his mercy and long forbearance our|&s;elves, by thus daring to pro&s;titute his awful name; nor &s;hall we pre&s;ume to deal out the bolts of his vengeance again&s;t others, whom his ju&s;tice may arraign as guilty of &s;uch a profanation. I therefore repeat it again, our only bu&s;ine&s;s will be to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch reflections as &s;hould engage the minds of Chri&s;tians on this occa&s;ion; to exhort you to turn your thoughts to your&s;elves; to con&s;ider the re|demption that has been wrought in your favour, and the di&s;po&s;ition with which you &s;hould receive the&s;e in&s;tances of the divine mercies.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t con&s;ideration that ari&s;es from the &s;ubject is the grateful &s;en&s;e you &s;hould entertain of the goodne&s;s of God.</P>
<P>The immediate impre&s;&s;ions of gratitude for pre&s;ent be|nefits are &s;trong, lively and affecting. We feel them with warmth; we expre&s;s them with rapture. But it happens
<PB N="4" REF="043110_0004_101CCC1B9B7C1E18">
too frequently that we enjoy them with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> difference, and by degrees totally forget the gracious <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that conferred them. While we are in danger, and fear is upon us, we "call upon the name of the Lord:" Our &s;ins and tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions affect us in their con&s;equences; and our future obedience, fidelity, and gratitude, are fervently pledged in the hopes of immediate protection and relief. But when the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e of our delivery is pa&s;t, when our ene|mies are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and danger removed, we are too apt to forget the re&s;olutions we formed in the hour of di&s;tre&s;s; our former pa&s;&s;ions and evil habits too frequently return with our former &s;ecurity. The God of our &s;alvation is forgotten, and repaid with ingratitude, neglect and di&s;o|bedience.</P>
<P>The conduct of individuals is generally &s;peaking, the conduct of the community. Ingratitude for favours, though a di&s;grace to our nature, is but too common in the private intercour&s;es of life; nor are the in&s;tances le&s;s frequent of the ungrateful returns which nations have made for public benefits conferred upon them. The odious vice in either ca&s;e receives its agravation in proportion to the mercies we have experienced, the favours we have been ble&s;&s;ed with, and the character of our benefactor: but &s;hould it extend to that beneficent power in whom we move, and have our being, and rob him of the return he challenges from his creatures for his boundle&s;s mercy and love, it then a&s;&s;umes its mo&s;t deformed &s;hape: it then re|ceives its utmo&s;t weight and accumulation of guilt.</P>
<P>All that is &s;acred or dear upon earth&mdash;your religion, your civil rights and liberties, the enjoyment of your pro|perty, the freedom of your per&s;ons, the wor&s;hip of your God, the comfort of the &s;acraments, the pre|&s;ence and exhortation of your Mini&s;ters&mdash;all that you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and gloried in as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects and as Chri&s;tians, wre&s;ted from you by violence and oppre&s;|&s;ion, while "the &s;hepherds were &s;mitten and the &s;heep of the flock &s;cattered abroad"&mdash;all the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, valua|ble &s;urely, if there be any &s;o on this &s;ide the grave, and the dearer to you now for having been &s;o cruelly deprived
<PB N="5" REF="043110_0005_101CCBE868162560">
of them, hath your God begun to re&s;tore to you in this your day; and with his &s;treched-out arm, in a manner vi&s;ible to every eye, brought you back to a pro&s;pect of happier days, and placed you again under the protecting care of the antient guardians of your religion and liberty. And can it be po&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould ever &s;uffer the re|membrance of the divine mercies, thus extended to you, to be blotted out from your minds? It were doing wrong to tho&s;e who have &s;uffered with the fortitude and per&s;everance, the loyalty and attachment to their &s;o|vereign, which have di&s;tingui&s;hed the friends of Go|vernment in this colony, even to &s;uppo&s;e it. And I &s;hould hope that they who have endured &s;o long and pain|ful a trial, rather than renounce their loyalty, or the re|ligious principles on which that loyalty is chiefly founded, will never hereafter be guilty of any action, or pur&s;ue any conduct, that can di&s;grace them as good &s;ubjects, or as virtuous Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>But while I thus exhort you to pre&s;erve in your grate|ful acknowledgements, to the God of your redemption, let me not neglect a point of equal importance to you, equally acceptable to him. The u&s;e, which in his gracious providence he de&s;igns we &s;hould make of the mi&s;conduct of others, or of the puni&s;hments which our &s;ins may have brought on our|&s;elves, is frequently pointed out in the &s;criptures. His vi|&s;itations he &s;ets up as marks to caution us again&s;t the rocks and &s;helves on which folly and vice have already cau&s;ed &s;o many to be wrecked! and wilfully to run upon them is to flight the divine mercy&mdash;is an aggravation of all our for|mer guilt, and ju&s;tly expo&s;es us to &s;till more &s;evere effects of the wrath of heaven. The P&s;almi&s;t, enumerating the vari|ous calamities inflicted on the I&s;raelites for their incredulity and di&s;obedience, mentions, as a &s;ource of additional mi&s;eries to this &s;tiff-necked people, that they neglected to profit by their own fatal experience, or the dreadful examples they daily &s;aw before their eyes, of the Lord's indignation. They refu&s;ed to humble them&s;elves beneath the divine cha&s;ti&s;ement, but continued to provoke their deliverer by fre&s;h proofs of ingratitude. "The wrath of God came
<PB N="6" REF="043110_0006_101CCC1E8156AAA8">
upon them, and &s;mote down the cho&s;en man of I&s;rael; for all this they &s;inned &s;till&mdash;therefore their days did he con|&s;ume in vanity, and their years in troubles." Entering into the&s;e views, my brethren, con&s;ider with me the &s;teps that have led your country into its pre&s;ent calamities&mdash; you will be the better enabled to check them in future, at lea&s;t to decline and avoid them your&s;elves. The ex|ce&s;&s;es of others will teach you a le&s;&s;on of prudence and moderation to regulate your own conduct.</P>
<P>"My &s;on, fear thou the Lord and the King, and med|dle not with them that are given to change"&mdash;was the excellent rule laid down by the wi&s;e&s;t of men. Again&s;t tho&s;e who tran&s;gre&s;s it, he denounces a &s;udden and ine|vitable de&s;truction. Whatever they may promi&s;e them|&s;elves, however they may &s;eem to pro&s;per for a time, ruin infallible ruin, awaits them when lea&s;t they expect it; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee the mi&s;eries they may entail on them&s;elves and their de&s;cendants&mdash;"their calamity &s;hall ri&s;e &s;uddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?" The words are remarkable, but they are dictated by wi&s;dom and &s;upported by experience. It has hap|pened from your former pro&s;perous &s;tate, and the pre&s;ent calamities of this province, from which you happily be|gin to re&s;pire, that no nation upon earth can form a better judgement upon this important que&s;tion than your&s;elves; and I have before me, in this a&s;&s;embly, a living example to which alone I need refer.</P>
<P>Call then to mind the happy and pro&s;perous days this colony enjoyed, when loyalty to your Sovereign, affection for the con&s;titution of your parent &s;tate, and obedience to the laws you enjoyed under its protection, di&s;tingui&s;hed it above all the other provinces of America. Your con|dition was then an object of envy to nations corrupted by the refinements of luxury. Peace was in your dwel|lings, plenty in your &s;treets&mdash;indu&s;try diffu&s;ed her ble&s;|&s;ings through your field with an increa&s;ing profu&s;ion, gi|ving life to all the u&s;eful arts, and nurturing them daily into maturity and perfection. The produce of your coun|try flowed from your port in a con&s;tant, uninterrupted
<PB N="7" REF="043110_0007_101CCBEC4B517218">
&s;tream, and you received in return the conveniences and comforts of life, and all the elegances which a free and ex|ten&s;ive commerce can be&s;tow on a prudent and contented people. A friendly, ho&s;pitable, and &s;ocial intercour&s;e united you together as the members of one family, to the admiration and delight of &s;trangers who re&s;ided among you; you were ble&s;&s;ed beyond the u&s;ual lot of men; hap|py, completely &s;o, did you but know how to value your happine&s;s, and to pre&s;erve it!</P>
<P>How different the &s;cene to which I mu&s;t call off your attention! what a change of pro&s;pect will the rever&s;e ex|hibit! where &s;hall we &s;eek for that trea&s;ure of happine&s;s which you could boa&s;t, when every man &s;at under his own vine, and eat his bread with chearfulne&s;s? Alas! is it not wa&s;ted all, and con&s;umed in vi&s;ionary &s;chemes, empty and fanciful as the dreams of the morning? Is it not &s;quander|ed away in lawle&s;s and ungrateful attempts, repugnant to every principle divine and human? in pur&s;uits which plain &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on condemn, and at which even the impul&s;es of nature mu&s;t recoil? Peace, frightened from the &s;eats where once &s;he loved to dwell, long &s;ince took her flight from among you. Di&s;&s;entions, party rage, public enmities, and private animo&s;ities, u&s;urped her place, and brought with them a horrid train of mutual fears, di&s;tru&s;ts, and endle&s;s jealou&s;ies. By the&s;e were the confidence and harmo|ny of all &s;ocial intercour&s;e de&s;troyed; by the&s;e were the bands of love and friend&s;hip torn a&s;under; by the&s;e were even the ties of con&s;anguinity and nature di&s;&s;olved. Self-intere&s;t, &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, the welfare of po&s;terity, prin|ciples ingrafted in the human mind by the beneficient crea|tor, were all confounded and lo&s;t in this dark and di&s;mal night of confu&s;ion, anarchy, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s. See in|du&s;try perverted from its u&s;eful purpo&s;es, and employed in improving the arts of de&s;truction. Your plough-&s;hares it turned into &s;words, and your pruning-hooks into &s;pears, the rever&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ing pronounced by I&s;aiah. See your fields, once cultivated, the gardens of America, laid wa&s;te, and turned into licentious encampments, and the de&s;ola|ting &s;cenes of war; &s;ee your commerce, your envied com|merce,
<PB N="8" REF="043110_0008_101CCC21A18AA3B0">
de&s;troyed, your property &s;eized and di&s;&s;ipated in &s;upport of the cau&s;e you abhorred&mdash;your liberties de&s;pi&s;ed and troden under foot, and an armed multitude in&s;ulting over your mi&s;eries, turned loo&s;e upon your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and rioting in your &s;ub&s;tance. In vain you looked up to ju&s;|tice for &s;upport; her &s;eats were overthrown, and trampled in the du&s;t; her rulers di&s;per&s;ed, and the people abondon|ed to every wild impul&s;e of humour and pa&s;&s;ion, without laws, without magi&s;trates, without form of government. In &s;hort, too well might we apply to you the words of Je|remiah: "If you went forth into the fields, behold the &s;lain with the &s;word; if you entered into the city, behold &s;he that was full of inhabitants, and prince&s;s among the provinces; &s;itting &s;olitary, and become as a di&s;con&s;olate, childle&s;s widow. Both the prophet and the prie&s;t went about in a land they knew not! your friends dealt treach|erou&s;ly with you, and become your enemies, while you were gone into captivity, becau&s;e of affliction, and becau&s;e of great &s;ervitude."</P>
<P>To what cau&s;es are we to attribute this deplore change? Whence is it that you can &s;ay to your&s;elves, &s;uch was the happine&s;s we once could boa&s;t; &s;uch the melancholy re|ver&s;e we have experienced! I have heard &s;ome attribute it to the imperfection of human nature, incapable of en|joying a durable &s;tate of pro&s;perity, and often times mo&s;t di&s;contended, when ble&s;&s;ed with the greate&s;t cau&s;e of con|tent. But I &s;hall &s;earch for it among the &s;ources of the decay and fall of all nations, which the &s;criptures of God point out to me. Warrented by the&s;e, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to a&s;&s;ert, that if this province had continued "to fear the Lord, and the King, and had not meddled with tho&s;e who are given to change," the tempe&s;t would have &s;pent its rage at a di&s;tance from you, and peace, indu&s;try, and happine&s;s, would &s;till have ble&s;&s;ed your dwellings, as they did of old. You, indeed, my friends, &s;eem to have been well convinced of this truth. The &s;truggle you maintain|ed was vigorous, and for &s;ome time &s;ucce&s;sful&mdash;but all were not animated with your &s;pirit. The love of novelty or what ever other cau&s;es the powers of darkne&s;s be&s;t can
<PB N="9" REF="043110_0009_101CCBEDEE113680">
tell&mdash;for it is impo&s;&s;ible to account for &s;uch folly and mad|ne&s;s on any known principles&mdash;&s;educed too many from their allegiance to their &s;overeign, and their former happy at|tachment to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and the&s;e antient bar|riers being once removed, all the di&s;orders that have well nigh overthrown your country, broke in upon you, and the depre&s;&s;ion of your religion, for the time, followed of cour&s;e. So true it is, that when re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and di&s;content once po&s;&s;e&s;s the mind, it is impo&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee to what extremes a rage for innovation, and a pa&s;&s;ion for change will tran&s;port their votaries. They are like the "un|clean &s;pirit" mentioned in the Go&s;pel, always on the wing, <HI>&s;eeking</HI> a place of re&s;t, but "never finding it." Exce&s;&s;es, at which men would have &s;huddered at their fir&s;t &s;etting out, "&s;wept clean," and placed in a delu&s;ive point of view by faction and party, lo&s;e their deformity, and daily make way for other exce&s;&s;es &s;till more criminal, &s;till more enormous. The&s;e di&s;&s;atisfied "&s;pirits take to them&s;elves other &s;pirits more wicked than them&s;elves, and the la&s;t &s;tate of the&s;e men becomes wor&s;e than the fir&s;t." I need not make the application&mdash;It is but too manife&s;t you have already done it for me.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that when too many of this province &s;uffered them&s;elves to be &s;educed from their allegiance to their &s;o|vereign, and their former happy attachment to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, the depre&s;&s;ion of your religion followed of cour&s;e. Let me not be mi&s;under&s;tood&mdash;I mean not to engage in an invidious point of controver&s;y, which has often been carried to &s;uch fatal lengths. Religious di&s;|putes obtrude them&s;elves too frequently into &s;ubjects of more political concern, and &s;erve no other end than to widen divi&s;ions, and encrea&s;e animo&s;ities, which the holy &s;y&s;tem, the intere&s;ts of which they would &s;eem to &s;upport, would wi&s;h to allay for ever. Warmed with zeal for their particular tenets, however une&s;&s;entially differing from each other, the pa&s;&s;ions of the di&s;putants work them&s;elves into the controver&s;y, and we are apt to a&s;cribe their ra&s;h and intemperate dictates to that &s;y&s;tem, the defence of which
<PB N="10" REF="043110_0010_101CCC24B04D4F88">
they have embraced. There is al&s;o another prejudice which is apt to lead us a&s;tray in this important matter. As in the different forms of government, at pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;h|ed throughout the Chri&s;tian world, religion is fundamen|tally connected with their civil and political in&s;titutes; we generally con&s;ider them as going hand in hand, and charge the creed of each particular &s;ect with the political errors and di&s;orders of its profe&s;&s;ors. A church there is, indeed, who&s;e principles have been proved by fatal experience to be &s;o e&s;&s;entially incon&s;i&s;tent with every notion of vice and rational government, &s;o infallibly introductive of a double &s;lavery, forging chains both for the body and mind, that it has been de&s;ervedly branded with this foul imputation, and ju&s;tly abhorred by nations jealous of their liberties. But that among Prote&s;tant churches, &s;uch a charge &s;hould be urged and retorted by each other with &s;o much viru|lence and animo&s;ity, hath long been a cau&s;e of grief to every well-wi&s;her of the reformed religion, and a great &s;ub|ject of triumph to their common enemies, both at home and abroad. Let me not attempt to enlarge the breach or be guilty of an error, which I condemn in others. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that in every age, in every &s;tate, there are men of depraved hearts, who put on religion as a cloak to cover their &s;ini&s;ter views; or u&s;e it as a political tool to work upon the minds of the weak and unin&s;tructed, and all who&s;e zeal without knowledge renders them an ea&s;y prey to the art of &s;educers. The&s;e, like the lame and impo|tent at the pool of Bethe&s;da, watch the troubling of the waters, that they may be the fir&s;t to take advantage of the public commotions, and on the ruins of the peace and happine&s;s of their country, pave the way to their own ad|vancement: Men, who declaim again&s;t every power but that which they have them&s;elves u&s;urped; to whom the pre|tence of the public good, and the intere&s;ts of their coun|try, is as ea&s;y as that of religion; and who a&s;&s;ume both in common with every re&s;tle&s;s male content, who in every age, under every government, has de&s;troyed the peace of the Chri&s;tian world.</P>

this is not the time, nor the place, to con&s;ider. Too cer|tain it is, that they have now ri&s;en to &s;uch a height of ag|gravation, as needs no words to repre&s;ent to you&mdash;you feel it beyond the energy of words. The &s;mart of recent wrongs and former injuries, &s;peak a language which tho&s;e who &s;ympathize with you in your &s;ufferings, can never adopt. Whatever the principles of your per&s;ecutors may be, their unrelenting malice is but too notorious; and they have added to all their former exce&s;&s;es, a deed of atrociou&s;ne&s;s which mu&s;t open the eyes of the mo&s;t infatuated, mu&s;t totally alienate even the &s;mall numbers, who may have hitherto been deluded into &s;ome favourable opinion of their cau&s;e. To what a &s;cene were you witne&s;s the night before la&s;t! when ju&s;t e&s;caped from the &s;torm, and imagining your|&s;elves arrived at a port of re&s;t; labouring to collect toge|ther the &s;mall remains of your fortune that had e&s;caped the general wreck; meeting once more and embracing, after &s;o long and painful a &s;eparation, the objects of your tendere&s;t affection, or &s;olacing your&s;elves with the hopes of being &s;peedily re-united to tho&s;e who were yet detained in bondage from you; congratulating your friends on your mutual deliverance, and the pro&s;pect that was opening to you of returning peace, quiet, and &s;ecurity.&mdash;In this dawn of your hopes and expectations, to awake at the midnight hour, and find your city in flames; to &s;ee your all, peri&s;hing before your eyes, and to know that your de&s;troyers were &s;ecretly among you, &s;preading the ruin, and exulting in the &s;ucce&s;s of their infernal &s;cheme!</P>
<P>This was not the &s;udden act of a vanqui&s;hed and flying enemy, perpetrated in the peevi&s;h moment of di&s;appoint|ment and defeat, or contrived to favour their e&s;cape. No, &mdash;&s;everal days had elap&s;ed &s;ince their flight, and quiet &s;eemed to have revi&s;ited you under the banner of your de|liverers. Even the ba&s;e incendiaries returned among you, wearing the ma&s;k of peace. We hoped that they had re|pented of their exce&s;&s;es&mdash;had been convinced of their folly and madne&s;s, and meant to embrace the proffered clemen|cy of their Sovereign, who was willing to forget the un|grateful revolt again&s;t his authority, their contempt of his

crown and government, and the in&s;ults offered to his per|&s;on. But they cried, "Peace, peace, when their was no peace." The blow they were meditating was the more dan|gerous, from its being thus concealed&mdash;they gloried in &s;tri|king it home, and nothing, under Heaven, but the activity of your Engli&s;h friends, could have prevented the whole city's falling a victim to their determined malice. Yes my friends, ye were witne&s;&s;es of it.&mdash;Ye &s;aw the treacherous adherents of the&s;e pretended guardians of your rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, who came to re&s;cue you from tyrany and op|pre&s;&s;ion, armed with firebrands, and under cover of the darkne&s;s, wrapping your city in flames. Ye &s;aw the brave and generous &s;ervants of your King,&mdash;that King, whom you have &s;o often heard repre&s;ented as a tyrant, who &s;ends forth his fleets and armies to en&s;lave, ravage, de&s;troy, fly|ing to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their fellow-&s;ubjects, in the mid&s;t of the flames, at the hazard of their lives, exerting every nerve to pre&s;erve your dwellings, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and tear|ing from the hands of the dark incendiaries the in&s;truments they had prepared for your de&s;truction. Had it plea&s;ed Heaven, that the &s;ucce&s;s could have an&s;wered their zeal, &s;o many families, once ble&s;&s;ed with comfort and affluence would not have been turned out on the world naked, help|le&s;s, and &s;tripped of their all.&mdash;The &s;eminary of indigent, merit, where poverty found a re&s;ource again&s;t ignorance, and where charity reclaimed thou&s;ands from idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation to virtue and indu&s;try, would yet have &s;tood.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the fire of Saturday, Sept. 21, a thou&s;and hou&s;es, nearly one-fourth of the city, were laid in a&s;hes, Trinity church, the public cha|rity &s;chool, the Rector's hou&s;e, and a Lutheran chapel, were among the buildings that were con&s;umed.&mdash;The lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained in hou&s;es, &amp;c. by the Corporation of Trinity Church, amounts at a moderate compu|tation, to thirty thou&s;and pounds New-York currency.</NOTE> The man&s;ion of your worthy and reverend Mini&s;ter, who&s;e ab&s;ence you &s;till regret, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions appropriated for the &s;upport of your clergy, would not have peri&s;hed, and added to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es they have already &s;uffered on your account and their own.&mdash;But "ye &s;mitten and afflicted," who beheld your "de&s;truction coming" on you "like a

whirlwind," your own indu&s;try, and the labour of your ance&s;tors, &s;wept off in the &s;pace of a moment, whither could you have fled from the rage of your enemies? Not even the Temples of the Lord were &s;acred from their fury &mdash;his altars could afford you no &s;anctuary. The mother of your churches, the ornament of your wor&s;hip, the fir&s;t edifice which the piety of your ance&s;tors had rai&s;ed to the God of their fathers, in gratitude for his mercies in a &s;trange land, was marked out for certain de&s;truction. Some child of perdition claimed to him&s;elf the merit of this daring &s;acrilege, and involved the ancient and venerable pile in the &s;ame ruin with which they de&s;igned to extirpate all the indearments of your Religion, every ve&s;tige of your ancient &s;plendor and glory.</P>
<P>In this &s;cene of univer&s;al danger and di&s;tre&s;s, to what can the mini&s;ters of God exhort you? If, &s;hould we know "what manner of &s;pirit we were of," if we &s;uffered any expre&s;&s;ions that may have fallen from us to be interpreted into a breach of charity, the crown of Chri&s;tian virtues; or into a de&s;ign of &s;harpening the virulence of party, or increa&s;ing animo&s;ities that have already too fatally de&s;troyed the peace of your Jeru&s;alem. To mini&s;ter &s;ome con&s;ola|tion in your &s;ufferings, as becometh the teachers of the Go&s;pel, who mu&s;t be unworthy indeed of the character thy bear, not to feel for the afflictions of their brethren, who look to them for comfort and in&s;truction; to &s;et before you "the loving kindne&s;&s;es of the Lord," and the redemption he hath wrought in your favour, and to exhort you to make every becoming return for his mercies and love; to point out to you, and warn you again&s;t the abu&s;es that have brought ruin upon your country, this has been our only aim. If we have &s;ucceeded, all our wi&s;hes are &s;atisfied and we &s;hall have the con&s;olation to think that you will &s;anctify this day, as becometh Chri&s;tians, by prayer and thank&s;giving; by repentance for pa&s;t &s;ins, and re&s;olutions of an amendment of life; by practi&s;ing the duties of that religion, for the intere&s;ts of which you have manife&s;ted &s;uch zeal and attachment; by laying a&s;ide all malice, ha|tred, and de&s;ire of revenge; by committing your cau&s;e to

together as friends and brethren. Let a reciprocation of further accompli&s;hment of his gracious de&s;igns. He who can "&s;till the raging of the &s;eas," knows be&s;t how to re&s;|tore peace and tranquility to your di&s;tracted country. May he correct the hearts, and reform the under&s;tandings of your infatuated brethren, who &s;till refu&s;e to contribute their endeavours towards healing the&s;e unhappy di&s;putes. And while their example proves a warning to you&mdash;while in their conduct, you con&s;ider the exce&s;&s;es to which tho&s;e may be tran&s;ported, who once pa&s;s the ancient bounds of lawful and &s;ettled government, may God give you grace to attach your&s;elves the more firmly to our happy con&s;ti|tution both in church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>Humbly, and with all due pro&s;tration of heart, I &s;hall venture to affirm that your cau&s;e is his own. It is the cau&s;e of peace, loyalty, and &s;ound rea&s;on, expo&s;ed to the attempts of mi&s;guided men, whom he &s;eems to have given over to a blindne&s;s of heart that hurries them into all the violence and artifice of &s;edition, frenzy, and rebellion. Fear not then, my friends, but in his own time "his wi&s;|dom will order all things &s;weetly." In the mean time, learn to re&s;ign your&s;elves to what ever means he may be plea&s;ed to employ for that end, and humble your&s;elves be|neath his cha&s;ti&s;ing, but fatherly hand. Would to God I could &s;ay that the danger were pa&s;t! But treachery, per|haps, &s;till lurketh among&s;t you. Let every man, there|fore, be careful and vigilant. Nature requires, and reli|gion approves, that we &s;hould make u&s;e of the means, which providence hath put into our power for our protection and &s;afety. But let this be your chief dependence, that he "who is with you, is greater than they who are again&s;t you." He, from whom alone your &s;afety can come "neither &s;lumbers nor &s;leeps." Though your enemies may hope "that the darkne&s;s &s;hall cover them, the dark|ne&s;s is no darkne&s;s with him." He will not let them "have their de&s;ire," nor their "mi&s;chievous imagination pro&s;|per." Let the &s;en&s;e of the common danger to which you are expo&s;ed, and the fellow&s;hip of your pa&s;t &s;ufferings, &s;trengthen the ties of charity between you, and bind you

the ju&s;tice of God, and waiting with re&s;ignation for the kindne&s;s and humanity di&s;tingui&s;hing you in this &s;ea&s;on of di&s;tre&s;s; to &s;often the rigour of each others &s;ufferings, and lighten the univer&s;al burthen of affliction. Be of one heart, and one mind, cleave together&mdash;commend your&s;elves to the protection of God, and doubt not but he will complete the work he hath already &s;o graciou&s;ly begun. And when he "&s;hall have plucked out" all &s;trife and enmity from among you, fear not but he will "re|turn, and have compa&s;&s;ion upon you, and bring you again every man to his heritage, and every man to his land."</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not fini&s;h as if I meant to di&s;appoint your expec|tations, and not adopt a conclu&s;ion which I am convin|ced you have already anticipated. The allegiance they had &s;worn to their lawful Sovereign, and an affectionate attachment to his virtuous character, compelled your clergy to &s;hut the&s;e doors, rather than admit the dutiful addre&s;&s;es, which the church enjoins them daily to offer to Heaven for his &s;afety. Let us therefore conclude the &s;er|vice of this day, when the freedom of your wor&s;hip is re&s;|tored to you, by uniting together with one heart, and one voice, to implore the divine favour and protection for our Sovereign Lord, King George; that God would be plea&s;ed to give him length of days, and encrea&s;e of hap|pine&s;s&mdash;to pro&s;per all his undertakings for the good of his people, and to ble&s;s him with what his actions prove, and his words a&s;&s;ert to be, the "<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See his Maje&s;ty's Speech at the conclu&s;ion of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parlia|ment.</NOTE> Favourite wi&s;h of his heart; the re&s;toration of harmony; and re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of order and happine&s;s in every part of his dominions."</P>
