<HEAD>Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>population of this wilderne&s;s, &s;o lately the range of &s;avages, and the lone&s;ome haunt of wild bea&s;ts, echoing with the frightful &s;creeches, and &s;onorous bootings of de&s;olate owis, is truely &s;ur|prizing! Every town, almo&s;t, north and &s;outh, thro' that tract we&s;t of Connecticut river, lately called the province of New-Hamp&s;hire; hath more or le&s;s inhabitants: As it is probable mo&s;t of the towns, in this large extended wilderne&s;s hath. One (I am in|formed) hath more than two hundred families in it; others are various. The town of Rutland, &s;ituate about &s;eventy miles from the north line of the pro|vince of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay, hath thirty-five families in it: more are coming.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But what is truly affecting is, That there is not more than one regular Mini&s;ter of the &s;tanding or|der &s;ettled, as ever I have heard of, in all this large extent; yea for a hundred miles or more, in length, and in breadth; perhaps as many from Con|necticut river, to Hud&s;on's river; and from the north line of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay, to Canada; in which there are even a multitude of people. And indeed, there are but few Mini&s;ters of any denomi|nation! Not only this; but what is &s;till more af|fecting is, The poverty or nearne&s;s of &s;ome, and the want of an inclination in many others, &s;eem to for|bid their having any at all, in mo&s;t places, at lea&s;t
<PB N="iv" REF="044789_0003_101F06595928B068">
at the pre&s;ent; and the affecting con&s;equences of a peo|ple continuing long in &s;uch circum&s;tances; with regard to religion, the wor&s;hip of God, and the</HI> Salvation <HI>of their &s;ouls, is ea&s;y to be perceived by the judicious.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Having a call, in providence, to preach the Go&s;|pel in this wilderne&s;s, in the mid&s;t of which I now am, and have been for &s;ome time; and being de&s;ired to a&s;&s;i&s;t in gathering a Church at Rutland, Octo|ber</HI> 20, 1783; <HI>and to preach on that occa&s;ion, (to which I con&s;ented) I thought proper, as &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, to give a de&s;cription of the true Church of Chri&s;t; without the lea&s;t thoughts of its ever appearing in public: However, it now appears, with a very little alteration, from what it was, when delivered; excepting the improvement, which I have con&s;iderably enlarged.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have but very little to &s;ay by way of apology for its publication; be&s;ides that very common one,</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> "That it is publi&s;hed at the earne&s;t de&s;ire of tho&s;e that heard it." <HI>For I have not the vanity to think, that there is any thing very extraordinary in it, to recommend it to the public: I apprehend, it contains plain truths, in a &s;tyle &s;uited to the ca|pacity of the auditory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I add this was &s;ome further inducement to me, to con&s;ent to its publication, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>. That I expect many of the books will be &s;cattered in this wilderne&s;s, where books are &s;carce: And if they may be of &s;er|vice to form in the minds of any, ju&s;t &s;entiments of the true Church of Chri&s;t, and awaken in them, an earne&s;t &s;olicitude to belong to this Church of Chri&s;t, my end is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, an&s;wered.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A De&s;cription of the TRUE CHURCH of CHRIST.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>I. PETER, ii. 5.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Ye al&s;o as living Stones, are built up a</HI> SPIRITUAL HOUSE, <HI>an</HI> HOLY PRIESTHOOD, <HI>to offer up</HI> SPIRITUAL SACRIFICES, <HI>acceptable to</HI> GOD, <HI>by</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle is here giving us a lively de&s;cription of the true <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Having fir&s;t de&s;cribed the foundation of the <HI>Church,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom he calls a '<HI>Living Stone,</HI>' (in the preceding ver&s;e) <Q><HI>Di&s;allowed indeed of men, but cho&s;en of God and precious.</HI></Q> In our text he &s;peaks of the Church, under the &s;ame metaphor, '<HI>Living Stones,'</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Living Stones;</HI> is according to the tran&s;lation in my Bi|ble: Since the compo&s;ure of the Sermon, I have &s;een it tran&s;lated '<HI>Lively,</HI>' In &s;ome other Bibles.</P>
<P>But, as I have not the original by me, nor is it in the&s;e parts; by which I might determine which is the righte&s;t; therefore I &s;hall let it &s;tand as it is penn'd.</P></NOTE> '<HI>Ye al&s;o as Living Stones,' &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Where we may ob&s;erve, he (the Apo&s;tle) de|&s;cribes the Church.</P>
<P>I. By her likene&s;s to Chri&s;t, with re&s;pect to internal, &s;piritual or divine life; '<HI>living.</HI>'</P>
<P>II. By her &s;tability '<HI>Stones.</HI>'</P>
<P><PB REF="044789_0005_101F065DB98EC1A8">
III. By her union with her&s;elf; '<HI>Built up a Spiritual Hou&s;e.</HI>'</P>
<P>IV. By her divine con&s;titution; '<HI>An Holy Prie&s;thood.</HI>'</P>
<P>V. By her exerci&s;es; '<HI>To offer up Sacrifices.</HI>'</P>
<P>VI. By the quality of the&s;e &s;acrifices, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> '<HI>Spiritual and holy.</HI>'</P>
<P>VII. By their acceptance with God; '<HI>Accep|table to God.</HI>'</P>
<P>VIII. By who&s;e merits the&s;e &s;piritual &s;acri|fices are acceptable to God, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> The merits of Chri&s;t, '<HI>Acceptable to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI>' Each of the&s;e particulars, in the de&s;cription of the true Church of Chri&s;t, I purpo&s;e briefly to con|&s;ider.</P>
<P>I. THE fir&s;t decription of the true Church, is in her likene&s;s to Chri&s;t, her foundation, with re&s;pect to her internal, &s;piritual or divine life; '<HI>Living.</HI>'</P>
<P>'<HI>Chri&s;t lives;</HI> and becau&s;e he lives,' '<HI>They &s;hall live al&s;o.</HI>' John 14. 19.</P>
<P>Every true member <HI>lives by Chri&s;t's life,</HI> for he lives in them; '<HI>I live,</HI>' (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>yet not I, but Chri&s;t liveth in me.</HI> Gal. XX. 20.</P>
<P>So likewi&s;e, they have the &s;ame <HI>kind</HI> of &s;piri|tual life, that is in Chri&s;t. Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>a living Stone;</HI> the foundation of this &s;piritual building! So likewi&s;e, the true members of his Church are <HI>living Stones;</HI> compacted together in this building&punc; The foundation and the &s;uper&s;truc|ture are alike in this; they are <HI>living Stones.</HI> This &s;piritual life con&s;i&s;ts in holine&s;s, divine love or benevolence. Some indeed &s;uppo&s;e, that
<PB N="9" REF="044789_0005_101F065DB98EC1A8">
holine&s;s is nothing but divine love; becau&s;e what the law of God requires of us, is holine&s;s, and the &s;um of what the law requires of us, is love: Love is the fulfilling of the law; (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle.) And upon the&s;e two command|ments of love to God and our neighbour, our Saviour makes to hang all the law and the pro|phets. However, &s;ome would make a little difference between holine&s;s and divine love: Holine&s;s in God (they &s;ay) is the &s;um of all his divine attributes: And holine&s;s in men they make comprehen&s;ive of all the variety of chri&s;tian graces, to be exerci&s;ed in the life of a chri&s;tian; as love, joy, peace, long &s;uffering, gentlene&s;s, goodne&s;s, faith, meekne&s;s, and temperance; which are called the fruits of the holy &s;pirit; Gal. v. 22, 23. And can any &s;ay, and &s;ay truly, that divine love, or benevolence, is not com|prehended of all the forementioned graces? Doubtle&s;s holine&s;s, is to be univer&s;ally of a right temper of mind: So likewi&s;e, for ought I know, love is radically this; a man de&s;titute of love, hath no right temper; without divine love, he doeth nothing that is truly virtuous; nothing that is truly prai&s;e worthy; without this, no|thing is done from a right principle, or to a right end: He that hath no true love to God, hath no &s;incere regard to his glory, in any thing that he doth. Without this, faith hath no real good|ne&s;s, or moral virtue in it. All gifts &amp; knowledge is vain without it: Yea, had a man all faith, &s;o that he could remove mountains, and under&s;tood all my&s;teries, and could &s;peak with the tongues of
<PB N="10" REF="044789_0006_101F065F81E46FA0">
men and angels, and was de&s;titute of this di|vine principle, they would make him no better than &s;ounding bra&s;s, or a tinkling cymbal; a bare &s;ign or repre&s;entation of &s;omething, when there is really nothing! Nay, &s;hould a man give all his goods to feed the poor, and his body to be burnt in &s;acrifice for his religion, and be de&s;ti|tute of love, it would profit him nothing: See all this confirmed, I Cor. Chap. xiii. Love is the very &s;oul and e&s;&s;ence of every grace, and the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of a good man, for with|out this, he is a wicked man, and dead in tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins. Love therefore, is the &s;um of all moral virtue, and of every chri&s;tian grace; yea the very &s;oul and life of them all: As without natural or animal life, there would be no natural actions; &s;o al&s;o without <HI>divine love,</HI> there would be no &s;piritual action. <HI>Natural self-love</HI> excites natural men to tho&s;e <HI>exerci&s;es,</HI> or ac|tions, which are proper for moral agents: So &s;u|pernatural and divine love excites to tho&s;e <HI>&s;piri|tual exerci&s;es</HI> and <HI>holy actions,</HI> which are <HI>peculiar</HI> to a <HI>renewea man.</HI> Without love of &s;ome kind or other, I cannot conceive of a man's acting at all, as a moral agent; and without &s;upernatu|ral or divine love, I can have no apprehen&s;ion of his acting at all in a &s;piritual manner; or with the lea&s;t regard to God, any more than I can conceive of a man's acting as a natural man, without natural life. Hence it is, I apprehend, that divine love is called <HI>&s;piritual life:</HI> And cer|tain it is, without divine love, men are dead, yea, wholly dead, in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e. But the
<PB N="11" REF="044789_0006_101F065F81E46FA0">
true members of Chri&s;t's Church, are conforma|ble to their &s;piritual and public head, in this; Chri&s;t the <HI>living Stone,</HI> in the foundation of his Church, and the Church built up of <HI>living Stones,</HI> upon this foundation</P>
<P>II. The true Church of Chri&s;t is de&s;cribed by her &s;tability, <HI>Stones.</HI> A metaphor borrowed from Stones which are compacted into a building, with an adjective, expre&s;&s;ing their peculiar, and di&s;tingui&s;hing quality, <HI>living Stones.</HI> A Stone is &s;olid and durable, not ea&s;ily moved with the wind; when wrought into a building, they continue for a great length of time. So the Church of Chri&s;t, compared to <HI>living Stones,</HI> built upon Chri&s;t, the <HI>living Stone,</HI> is durable, &s;taple and firm: It continues through every age, firm as the everla&s;ting mountains: It continues through all the convul&s;ions of States and King|doms. Whatever deva&s;tations and revolutions take place, in the world, the Church mu&s;t live; though earth and hell con&s;pire together to de|&s;troy it, '<HI>Yet mu&s;t this building ri&s;e!</HI>' Though Satan, with all his malicious arts, and diabolical &s;ubtilty, lay ten thou&s;and &s;nares to de&s;troy it, he cannot prevail; <HI>for it is founded on a rock.</HI> He that fights again&s;t her, fights again&s;t God; who will be &s;ure to avenge '<HI>The quarrel.'</HI> 'Tis with re&s;pect to the Church that he &s;ays <Q><HI>Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm?</HI></Q> P&s;al. cv, 15. Hurt not (q. d.) the people con|&s;ecrated to me, by the gifts and graces of my &s;pirit; and tho&s;e, e&s;pecially among them, to whom I farmiliarly reveal my mind and will, that
<PB N="12" REF="044789_0007_101F066246E843C8">
they may teach others. The Church is called the bride, the lamb's wife, and is mo&s;t dear to the almighty bridegroom: And who&s;oever touches his bride, (i.e. hurts or injures her,) &s;hall find the arm of her almighty hu&s;band to be &s;trong; who will '<HI>Soon avenge the wrong.</HI>' For thus &s;aith the Lord, to his Church; '<HI>He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye..</HI>' Zach. 2, 8. And how <HI>precious!</HI> how <HI>dear!</HI> the Church of Chri&s;t is to him, he hath manife&s;t|ed in many &s;triking in&s;tances of his providence, in puni&s;hing tho&s;e that injured or were unkind to her. For this cau&s;e he plagued and de&s;troyed the Egyptians, and when they pur&s;ued his peo|ple to the red &s;ea, they were all myraculou&s;ly drowned in it; they &s;ank as lead in the mighty waters; yea they &s;ank like a &s;tone to the bot|tom: That this was the ca&s;e is further evident from Joel, iii, 19. <HI>Egypt &s;hall be a de&s;olation, for the violence again&s;t the children of Judah, becau&s;e they &s;hed innocent blood in their land.</HI> How did it fare with the Amalekites for their unkindne&s;s, becau&s;e they did not meet God's antient Church with bread and water; but in&s;tead of this, they &s;mote the hindermo&s;t part of them that were weary and faint; therefore the Lord gave it in charge, utterly to de&s;troy Amalak, and to blot out his name from under heaven; which was fully accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>And how did it fare with the Babylonians, for captivating God's people? though done by his permi&s;&s;ion and direction of his providence. They were threatned with perpetual de&s;olation for it,
<PB N="13" REF="044789_0007_101F066246E843C8">
which threatning has been and &s;till is fulfilling: <Q><HI>Babylon &s;hall become a heap, a dwelling place for dragons, an a&s;toni&s;hment, and an hi&s;&s;ing, without an inhabitant.</HI></Q> Jer. ii 37. This city, though the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> magnificent of any in the known world, is made a perpetual de&s;o|lation, <HI>never more to be built or inhabited from ge|neration to generation forever.</HI> See Jer. I. 39, 40, ver&punc; and I&s;a. xiii, 19, to the end, where the de&s;olation, perpetual de&s;olation of Babylon, is very fully and emphatically expre&s;&s;ed. And how did it fare with the Jews them&s;elves, when they rejected the King of Zion, and per&s;ecuted his Church? Why he <HI>mi&s;erably de&s;troyed tho&s;e murderers, and burnt up their city Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Tho' Kings, Rulers and people of I&s;rael joined to de|&s;troy the Church, yet they failed. What though with hand joined in hand, they &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t the Lord, and again&s;t his anointed, yet, <Q><HI>He that &s;itteth in the Heavens laughed, as the Lord then had them in deri&s;ion.</HI></Q> And though all the powers of Rome, when &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of the world, were bent to de&s;troy and to root out the chri&s;tian name, from under Heaven; though &s;he (Rome) murdered millions, and chri&s;tian blood flowed down like rivers; &s;he could not prevail. Under all the&s;e trials, the Church rather increa&s;ed, than dimini&s;hed; the &s;uffering of one martyr was &s;ometimes the means of converting numbers. They who per|&s;ecuted the Church, made war with the lamb, and he overcame them; for he is <HI>Lord of Lords and King of King's.</HI> Rev. xvii, 14. Thus &s;taple
<PB N="14" REF="044789_0008_101F06650FF426F8">
and firm is the true Church of Chri&s;t, and no|thing &s;hall be able to de&s;troy it: earth and hell have tried out their &s;trength, in combinations and have not prevailed; for the Lord God and the Lamb is in the mid&s;t of her. He keeps her, he watches over her with as much care and ten|derne&s;s as the apple of his eye; and the gates of hell cannot prevail again&s;t her, cannot overcome her. Thus the church is firmer than heaven and earth, and more un&s;haken than the &s;olid world; her foundation is &s;trong, &s;he is built up|on a living rock, from which &s;he cannot be &s;ha|ken or removed, for &s;he is united to it, and the union is indi&s;&s;oluble.</P>
<P>III. The true church of Chri&s;t is de&s;cribed by her union with her&s;elf, <HI>built up a &s;piritual hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>This metaphor &s;hews how the church is unit|ed with it&s;elf. As &s;tones which are compacted to|gether in a building, by the arti&s;t, are all united together and make one hou&s;e; &s;o the Church of Chri&s;t, as <HI>living &s;tones,</HI> is one <HI>&s;piritual hou&s;e built</HI> together by the great ma&s;ter builder, in which hou&s;e he dwells forever. As this building is unit|ed to the living &s;tone which is its foundation, &s;o likewi&s;e the&s;e <HI>living &s;tones</HI> which compo&s;e this building, are united among them&s;elves, cement|ed in love, which holds it together, and the uni|on is indi&s;&s;oluble: Not one living &s;tone &s;hall e|ver fail in this building. For this the redeemer prayed and his prayer is always effectual. John xvii. 11, 21, 22, 23. "Holy father, keep through thine own name tho&s;e whom thou ha&s;t given me, <HI>that they may be one as we are.'</HI> <Q><HI>That they all
<PB N="15" REF="044789_0008_101F06650FF426F8">
may be one,</HI> as thou father art in me, and I in thee, that they al&s;o may be ONE in us: And the glory, which thou gave&s;t me, have I gi|ven them; that they may be ONE, even as we are ONE: I in them and thou in me; that they may be made perfect in ONE: That the world may know that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me, and ha&s;t <HI>loved them even as thou ha&s;t loved me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Church is called <Q><HI>The only one</HI> of her mother, and the <HI>choice one</HI> of her that bare her.</Q> Cant. vi, 9, which denotes that the Church of Chri&s;t is <HI>one,</HI> and is mo&s;t dear to him, who is the great founder of it. This union in the Church, the Apo&s;tle de&s;cribes by the &s;imilitude of a hu|man body, which is united to the head, by joints and bands, from which it receives nou|ri&s;hment, and being knit together it increa&s;eth, with the increa&s;e of God, Coll. ii, 19. and that which cements together the &s;everal parts of Chri&s;t's my&s;tical body, (the Church) is love, Coll. ii, 2. <HI>Being knit together in love.</HI> The liv|ing members, in Chri&s;t's Church, are <HI>one,</HI> in all the following re&s;pects, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> They all have one and the &s;ame public head, even Chri&s;t, from whom they receive &s;piritual nouri&s;hment and growth in grace. They all tru&s;t their &s;alvation in his merits alone. They all with one con&s;ent hold the e&s;&s;ential doctrines of the Go&s;pel, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Such as the&s;e, Salvation from &s;in and hell, by free and &s;overeign grace alone, be&s;towed thro' the merits of the great Redeemer. Their de|pendence is &s;olely upon the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t to clothe them in the &s;ight of a holy God; they
<PB N="16" REF="044789_0009_101F0666F14678B0">
all tru&s;t in the merits of his blood, for the at|tonement of their &s;ins: The merit of his obedi|ence, &amp; death for the ju&s;tification of their per&s;ons, and acceptance with God, both of their per&s;ons and &s;ervices; eternal life and happine&s;s in the enjoyment of God: They all depend upon his &s;pirit and grace to &s;anctify them and make them meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the &s;aints in light. In the&s;e they all agree, if they are capable of under&s;tanding doctrines: If there be babes in Chri&s;t, that do not clearly under|&s;tand doctrines at pre&s;ent, yet &s;urely they have a di&s;po&s;ition to under&s;tand, and as &s;oon as they do under&s;tand, or have ju&s;t notions of the truth, they cordially embrace it: They have a <HI>&s;piritual ta&s;te</HI> and <HI>appetite</HI> for the doctrines of free grace; they are plea&s;ed with them and like them in their hearts; for like new born babes, in health, they de&s;ire the &s;incere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby, which no un&s;anctified &s;oul doth. Doubtle&s;s there are ma|ny, who have &s;o much light and conviction of the truth, that they are forced to acknowledge it; yet have no love for it; no appetite for it at all in their hearts. They may have the form of knowledge and of the truth, who do not love it: This the Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;erts Rom. ii. 20, to 24. concerning tho&s;e to whom he does not give a very good character, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>.

<P>IV. THE Church is de&s;cribed by her divine con&s;titution, <HI>an holy prie&s;thood.</HI> One &s;pecial part of the prie&s;ts office, under the law, was to offer &s;acrifices.

This &s;piritual and holy prie&s;thood, is peculiarly de&s;criptive of the true Church of Chri&s;t, it is their peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing character, as it cannot ju&s;tly be attributed to any other. None truly give up them&s;elves to God, as liv|ing &s;acrifices, none are devoted to his &s;ervice but &s;aints; of which are compo&s;ed the true Church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>V. The true Church of Chri&s;t is de&s;cribed by her exerci&s;es, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>to offer up &s;acrifices:</HI> which &s;he
<PB N="20" REF="044789_0011_101F066B158A5FB0">
does in con&s;equences of her divine con&s;titution, '<HI>A holy prie&s;thood.</HI>'</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;acrifices con&s;i&s;t in the offering up of their &s;ouls, their bodies, with all their powers and faculties to God, to be employed in his &s;er|vice. Their hearts are given to God; (i. e.) <HI>they &s;incerely love him.</HI> It is not uncommon for lovers to &s;ay to the beloved friend, <Q>You have my heart! or I have given you my heart!</Q> So the Church of Chri&s;t has given him her heart; and Chri&s;t hath &s;et his heart upon the Church, his &s;pou&s;e: the divine will is her will; this is the rule by which &s;he walks. She choo&s;|es tho&s;e things which God choo&s;es; Chri&s;t and his Church have the &s;ame object of love and hatred: &s;he is ready both to do and to &s;uffer for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. <Q><HI>In the wor&s;hip of her God, &s;he &s;pends her daily breath.</HI></Q> She dearly loves the wor&s;hip and ordinances of Chri&s;t, where he is wont to reveal his power and grace: She loves to hear of Chri&s;t, of his love and divine excellencies: And her meditation of him is &s;weet, even in the night watches; &s;he is ready to part with all for his &s;ake; to &s;acrifice name, e&s;tate, and life it&s;elf, for his &s;ake <Q><HI>whom her &s;oul loveth.</HI></Q> Yea to e&s;teem reproaches, for Chri&s;t, to be great riches, Heb. xi. 26&punc; She can take joyfully the &s;poiling of her goods, and part with father and mother, and other near and dear relatives, hou&s;es and lands, and life it&s;elf for his &s;ake and the Go&s;ple's. Unle&s;s men can part with all for Chri&s;t's &s;ake and the Go&s;pel's, they are not, nor can they be his true deciples; (this
<PB N="21" REF="044789_0011_101F066B158A5FB0">
we have from his own mouth) this truth is il|lu&s;trated from the words of the Apo&s;tle; <Q><HI>I am not only ready to be bound</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>but to die for the name of Je&s;us,</HI></Q> Acts, xxi, 13. <Q><HI>yea, doubtle&s;s, and I count all things but lo&s;s, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us my Lord, for whom I have &s;uffered the lo&s;s of all things, and do count them but dung,</HI></Q> &amp;c. Phil. iii. 8. And, not only St. Paul, but every living mem|ber in the Church of Chri&s;t, is ready to &s;a|crifice every thing, and count them as dung for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. In this manner the Church offers up &s;acrifice to God.</P>
<P>VI. The Church is further de&s;cribed by the quality of tho&s;e &s;acrifices which &s;he offers, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>&s;piritual and holy,</HI> they are not &s;uch earnal &s;acri|fices, as were in u&s;e under the law; nor do they con&s;i&s;t in modes and forms or meer bodily exer|ci&s;es, which profiteth little, I. Tim. iv. 8. which may be done intirely without the heart; but they are &s;acrifices &s;piritual and holy; &s;piritual &s;acrifices, are &s;uch religious exerci&s;es, as are per|formed by the &s;pecial and genuine influences of the holy &s;pirit; from whence the term &s;piritu|al is taken in &s;cripture. They are &s;uch exer|ci&s;es therefore, as are peculiar to the &s;piritual man, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Saints; and is given in our text, as one of the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tics of the true Church of Chri&s;t: Certainly, none but &s;piritual men of|fer &s;piritual and holy &s;acrifices; and the &s;piritual man in the &s;cripture dialect, is the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing character of a good man, or a true Saint, I Cor. ii. 14, 15, and Gal. vi. I. The natural
<PB N="22" REF="044789_0012_101F066CD42A4EC8">
man receiveth not the things of the &s;pirit of God, &amp;c. <HI>But he that is &s;piritual judgeth all things: Ye which are &s;piritual, re&s;tore &s;uch an one in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s:</HI> By which it is abun|dantly plain, that by a &s;piritual man, he means a true Saint, or a living member in Chri&s;t's Church. And it is peculiar to &s;uch as are &s;pi|ritual, to offer up &s;piritual &s;acrifices; otherwi&s;e a corrupt tree may bring forth good fruit; but in a word, &s;piritual and holy &s;acrifices, are &s;uch exerci&s;es as God requires, being done with tho&s;e inward and holy affections; &s;uch as faith, love, joy, &amp;c. which are effected and maintained by the holy &s;pirit of grace, dwelling in tho&s;e who are the &s;ubjects of tho&s;e graces, by his genuine operations, in which he communicates his own image or nature: Such are &s;aid to <HI>be made partakers of the divine nature.</HI></P>
<P>VII. THE true Church of Chri&s;t is de&s;cribed by the acceptance of her &s;acrifices, '<HI>Acceptable to God.</HI>' By this the living members of Chri&s;t's Church are di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others; none be&s;ides tho&s;e who belong to the true Church are <HI>acceptable to God:</HI> The &s;acrifices, i. e. Spiritual &s;acrifices of the true Church alone, are acceptable to God; '<HI>But the &s;acrifices of the wicked are an abomination.</HI>' Do you de&s;ire to know what acceptance means? I will endeavour to inform you. In our text it mu&s;t mean <HI>favora|bly</HI> or <HI>kindly</HI> to <HI>receive;</HI> it &s;ignifies, being <HI>plea&s;ed,<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> delighted with;</HI> thus God is plea&s;ed or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> with his Church. This is evident in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> he is &s;aid to &s;ee '<HI>No &s;pot or wrinkle in her'</HI>&punc;
<PB N="23" REF="044789_0012_101F066CD42A4EC8">
It is further evident, in that he is &s;aid '<HI>To re|joice over her.</HI>' That the Lord Je&s;us likewi&s;e takes peculiar plea&s;ure and delight in his Church and in the exerci&s;e of her graces, is evident from many endearing appellations, that he gives her as <Q><HI>My &s;i&s;ter, my &s;pou&s;e, my love, my dove, my un|defiled;</HI></Q> often repeated, <Q>I am come into my garden, my &s;i&s;ter, my &s;pou&s;e: <HI>I have gathered my myrrh with my &s;pice; I have eaten my honey comb with my honey; I have drank my wine with my milk.</HI></Q> Cant. V, I. The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, no doubt, have reference to the Church's graces, in which he greatly delights; that the prayers of the Saints are plea&s;ing and delightful to God, is evident, in that they are compared to <HI>incen&s;e,</HI> Rev v, 8. (which was a rich perfume, u&s;ed in &s;acrifices by God's appointment, typify|ing the precious blood of Chri&s;t,) likewi&s;e the preaching of the Go&s;pel, by the faithful mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, is mentioned as mo&s;t plea&s;ing and ac|ceptable to God; though &s;ome did not believe, 2 Cor. ii, 15. '<HI>We are unto God,'</HI> <Q><HI>A &s;weet &s;a|vour of Chri&s;t, in them that are &s;aved, and in them that peri&s;h;</HI></Q> and in a word, every &s;piri|tual &s;acrifice is plea&s;ing and acceptable to God; which he will mo&s;t graciou&s;ly reward; this brings me to &s;ay.</P>
<P>VIII. BY who&s;e merits the&s;e &s;piritual &s;acri|fices are acceptable to God, '<HI>Acceptable to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI>' That is, by his merits: excel|lent as the Church is, and, however high in God's account, yet neither the Church nor her &s;acri|fices, (or religious &s;ervices) are acceptable to
<PB N="24" REF="044789_0013_101F06735BAB86D0">
God on account of her own merits or excellency, but wholly by the merits of Chri&s;t; &s;he is ac|counted righteous, by his righteou&s;ne&s;s imput|ed; acquitted from the guilt of &s;in, by the vir|tue of his atonement; made holy by the &s;anc|tification of his &s;pirit; otherwi&s;e &s;he could not be acceptable to God. Hence it is, we are &s;aid to '<HI>Be made accepted in the beloved,'</HI> Eph. i. 6. The prayers of <HI>all</HI> Saints are &s;aid to a&s;cend, with the incen&s;e of Chri&s;t's merit, &s;ee Rev. viii, 3, 4. However it may be, that &s;ome &s;inners expect acceptance with God, on account of their own excellencies and virtue of their good deeds (as it is certain they have no dependence upon, or tru&s;t in the merits of Chri&s;t) yet it may be pre&s;umed, that the Saints, or the living members of Chri&s;t, (acting in character) have no dependence upon any goodne&s;s or merit of their own, to recom|mend them to the divine favour; nor indeed, do they &s;o much as de&s;ire acceptance with God, either of their per&s;ons or &s;ervices, but by the merits of Chri&s;t; becau&s;e in no other way, can God, con&s;i&s;tently with the honor of his divine, perfections, accept of them: And as they love the divine honor, they cannot in any other way, de&s;ire acceptance. This, in one view, is the true Church of Chri&s;t, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> She is alive; all the members in this Church, are living members of Chri&s;t; they live, by Chri&s;t living in them: The life is a &s;piritual and divine life: The &s;ame kind of life is in every true member of this my&s;|tical body of Chri&s;t; as is in the divine head: From this divine head, &s;pritual life is commu|nicated
<PB N="25" REF="044789_0013_101F06735BAB86D0">
to every true&punc; member in this building; the foundation and the &s;uper&s;tructure are alike. The e&s;&s;ence of this life, con&s;i&s;ts in holine&s;s or divine love. This hou&s;e (the Church) is built upon a rock, and built with <HI>living Stones;</HI> there|fore no &s;torms can overthrow it: The blowing winds, and driving rains, how fiercely &s;oever they beat upon it, cannot overturn it: No &s;torms of per&s;ecution; no trial or temptation nor yet the gates of hell can overcome it.</P>
<P>Not one of the&s;e living Stones, &s;hall ever be jo&s;tled from its foundation; not one can ever be moved out of its place; nor one Stone &s;epe|rated from another, in this building; for they are cemented together by an indi&s;&s;oluble union: And the cement that holds them together, is divine love, which never fails. <HI>Charity never faileth:</HI> This is a <HI>Royal Prie&s;thood,</HI> who&s;e bu&s;i|ne&s;s is to offer up &s;piritual &s;acrifices; which are holy and acceptable to God, by the merits of Chri&s;t; by which &s;he is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others: None of all the human race be&s;ides, can be compared to her in the&s;e re&s;pects; no o|ther can offer &s;uch &s;acrifices: The &s;acrifices of the re&s;t of mankind, are carnal and dead; as dif|ferent as tho&s;e offered by Cain and Able; but the &s;acrifices offered by this Royal Prie&s;thood, are &s;piritual and holy, plea&s;ing and acceptable to God; in which he &s;mells a &s;weet &s;avour, being perfumed with the mo&s;t co&s;tly <HI>incen&s;e;</HI> the pre|cious <HI>merits, righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>atoning blood of God,</HI> Acts xx. 28.

<HEAD>Improvement.</HEAD>
<P>FROM this de&s;cription of the Church of Chri&s;t, it is ea&s;y to perceive, even at the very fir&s;t blu&s;h, that no unrenewed, unbelieving per&s;on, belongs to the true Church of Chri&s;t. They have none of tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing charac|teri&s;tics of his true Church, as for in&s;tance, they have no <HI>&s;piritual or divine life or love:</HI> They are not <HI>built upon the living Stone,</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the foundation of the Church: They have no union with Chri&s;t the head: They derive no &s;piritual nouri&s;hment from him: If they creep into his fold among his &s;heep, they come not in by Chri&s;t, the door; but climb over &s;ome other way; and after all, they are but goats, who leave a &s;tinking &s;avour behind them; and will be &s;et on the left hand of Chri&s;t, in the la&s;t great day of trial. Though they eat and drink at his table, they are not nouri&s;hed; and will at la&s;t be di&s;owned by Chri&s;t: And though they have had the faith of miracles, and have ca&s;t out devils in his name, he will bid them depart ac|cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire: And though they be counted among the living branches in Chri&s;t the vine, they have no vital union with him nor do they derive any &s;ap or nouri&s;hment from him, but are dry and u&s;ele&s;s branches, that will be pruned off and ca&s;t into the fire. They have
<PB N="27" REF="044789_0014_101F0676895D23F8">
no proper and indi&s;&s;oluble union among the living branches: If in any re&s;pect, they may be &s;aid to be united to the Saints, it is an im|proper &s;en&s;e; the union can be no better, nor any other, than <HI>the union of the dead and the living together;</HI> in which ca&s;e there can be no <HI>&s;piritual communion.</HI> Communion &s;ignifies fellow&s;hip, a par|ticipation, or receiving together&punc; But living and dead branches have no fellow&s;hip; com|munion, or participation of vital &s;ap from the true vine Chri&s;t Je&s;us; for <Q><HI>For what communi|on on hath light with darkne&s;s, or what part have be|lievers with unbelievers.</HI></Q> "Can the dead a|ri&s;e and eat the banquet of the living?" (&s;aith Mr. J. Allen.) And can they any more, who are &s;piritually dead, participate of the &s;piritual banquets of tho&s;e &s;piritually alive? Surely no. And however, gracele&s;s, unrenewed &s;ouls, may be numbered in the Church of Chri&s;t; they are not living, but dead; and truly and really be|long not to it; for this building is made up of living Stones; not one dead Stone is to be found in it; but of <HI>living Stones, is built a &s;piritual hou&s;e.</HI> This is another di&s;tingui&s;hing character, which every gracele&s;s-per&s;on is de&s;titute of; for they never have the character of &s;piritual, but carnal, given to them in &s;cripture: Spiritual and carnal are very different and oppo&s;ite cha|racters; by which Saints and &s;inners are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed. The term &s;piritual is taken from the holy &s;iprit, (as before noted) they and they on|ly, are called &s;piritual in the &s;cripture dialect; in whom the holy &s;pirit dwells, by his genuine
<PB N="28" REF="044789_0015_101EFEB3799C1F88">
operations; in which he communicates his own nature; <HI>but not his divine e&s;&s;ence:</HI> The nature which he communicates is a temper or di&s;po&s;i|tion of mind like him&s;elf, i. e. the moral image of God in the &s;oul. Now this indwelling of the holy &s;pirit is peculiar to the Saints. Hence the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, '<HI>If any man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his.</HI>' That it is abundantly evident, that no unrenewed per&s;on, can have a|ny ju&s;t preten&s;ions to union with, or intere&s;t in this &s;piritual hou&s;e, the true Church. Nor can they lay any ju&s;t claim to this holy Prie&s;thood; they are not yet &s;et apart, (by the divine influ|ences of the holy &s;pirit) to offer &s;piritual &s;acri|fices; this they can have no ju&s;t preten&s;ions to; for none but &s;piritual men can offer &s;piritual &s;a|crifices. They never gave up them&s;elves, &s;oul and body to God; nor any thing that is their's, to be employed in his &s;ervice. That unholy &s;ouls do not offer up &s;piritual &s;acrifices, is evi|dent; becau&s;e the&s;e &s;acrifices are holy: And a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit; <HI>nor doth a bitter fountain &s;end forth &s;weet waters. Men do not gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thi&s;|tles.</HI> Even nature it&s;elf teaches, that the fruit cannot be &s;uperior to the tree that bears it. By the&s;e &s;imilitudes our &s;aviour &s;hews, that it is the di&s;tingui&s;hed character of a good man, to bring forth good fruit, as he him&s;elf explains it.</P>
<P>Furthermore, no gracele&s;s per&s;on can ju&s;tly pretend to acceptance with God: Acceptance, as heretofore explained, &s;ignifies to be plea&s;ed or delighted, &amp;c. But God can be plea&s;ed, or

<P>Nor can gracele&s;s &s;inners, expect acceptance with a God of infinite holine&s;s, on their own account, without the mo&s;t daring pre&s;ump|tion and infidelity; for if Saints, who have &s;ome degree of holine&s;s within, '<HI>Are made ac|cepted only in Chri&s;t the beloved,</HI>' in who&s;e righte|ou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall the wicked and ungodly appear.

2d. Is the true Church &s;o high in God's ac|count, as you have heard; as dear as the apple of his eye: We hence learn, how dear &s;he &s;hould be to us! How high in our e&s;teem!

4th. Is the Church &s;o dear to God, &s;o high in his e&s;teem, as you have heard? Hence &s;ee how very dangerous it is to injure this &s;pou&s;e of Chri&s;t, though but in one of her members; touch her, and you touch the apple of his eye; injure her, and his almighty arm &s;hall &s;oon a|venge the wrong. She is injured, when &s;he is deprived of the mini&s;try of the word and ordi|nances of the Go&s;pel; tho&s;e brea&s;ts of con&s;ola|tion, by which &s;he is refre&s;hed, and her &s;piritual appetite regaled.

<P>This may be done many ways; but particu|larly, &s;he may be deprived of the word and or|dinances of the Go&s;pel, by rai&s;ing per&s;ecution a|gain&s;t her, or her officers; either with the &s;word of &s;teel, or of the tongue: This may be done by &s;tiring up the people again&s;t the Pa&s;tor, or again&s;t the truth, unju&s;tly fomenting divi&s;ions: A hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf, cannot &s;tand: Schi&s;ms and rents in the body wounds it, divide it in the mid&s;t, and it is de&s;troyed.

Do none belong to the true Church of Chri&s;t be&s;ides tho&s;e, whom the &s;cripture calls '<HI>living Stones,</HI>' in our text, compacted into one building, cemented together by divine love: Then it is glaringly evident, <HI>that out of this Church, there is no Salvation:</HI> No building of this kind can &s;tand, unle&s;s built upon the living, the chief corner Stone, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in the foun|dation of this building&punc; for a hou&s;e built upon the &s;and will fall: None but living branches are united to the vine, &s;o as to derive any &s;ap or nouri&s;hment from it; but will be pruned off, &s;eperated from that <HI>&s;uperficial and &s;eeming union that they have, and ca&s;t into the fire.</HI> The King of the Church hath declared, the gates of hell &s;hall never prevail again&s;t his Church, built up|on a rock, but they will eternally prevail a|gain&s;t every dry branch in it. Here it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that no unbeliever is built upon this rock; Such as are only vi&s;ibly, in appearance, or by profe&s;&s;ion, in the Church of Chri&s;t, are the children of the kingdom that &s;hall be ca&s;t our, Mat. viii. 12. The&s;e, (he hath told us) he will di&s;own, as none of his, at the la&s;t day; and pro|fe&s;s he never knew them to be &s;uch as they pro|fe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to be; notwith&s;tanding any boa&s;ted profe&s;&s;ion of having <HI>eat and drank in his pre&s;ence;</HI> or of many great and miraculous things done in his name, even that of ca&s;ting out devils.

<P>This di&s;cour&s;e may be further improved by way of enquiry; whether we do truly belong to this living Church of Chri&s;t or not.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The fir&s;t thing to be enquired after, is, whether you have any &s;piritual or divine life in you or not; for there are no lifele&s;s members in the true Church of Chri&s;t, as you have heard. If you are able to determine this point, it will be &s;ufficient to determine your character. Let me a&s;k you? Do you perceive any &s;igns of life in you? Do you breathe &s;piritually? Do you perform the functions of the living? If you are alive (in the &s;en&s;e we &s;peak,) Chri&s;t lives in you, the holy &s;pirit dwells in you by his divine influences; for the Apo&s;tle has given, us this &s;ign, if you have this divine life, '<HI>You have the witne&s;s in your&s;elves:</HI>' A&s;k your&s;elves, whether you have the fruits of the &s;pirit, as faith, love, joy, meekne&s;s, patience, long &s;uffering, gentle|ne&s;s, goodne&s;s, &amp;c. I add, if you have this e|vidence, you have been quickened, i. e. made &s;piritually alive; who before, were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins. If you be ri&s;en with Chri&s;t, you &s;eek tho&s;e things that are above, where Chri&s;t Je&s;us is: If &s;o, your trea&s;ures are laid up in heaven, and your hearts are there al&s;o: If you are new born, you will de&s;ire the &s;incere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby;
<PB N="35" REF="044789_0018_101F06850C32C5B0">
you will hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s; you will long after perfect conformity to God: If you be a living member in Chri&s;t, God will be the object of your &s;upreme love and de&s;ires: Your &s;ouls will pant after God; they will thir&s;t for God, even for the living God: your meditations of him will be &s;weet in the night watches: You will make his word your &s;tudy and delight, the man of your council, your guide: According to this rule, you will endeavour to form your hearts and lives. Again enquire: Have you had a <HI>real, &s;en&s;ible di&s;covery</HI> of the <HI>ravi&s;hing beauty</HI> of Chri&s;t, the excellency of his per&s;on and charac|ter; &s;o that he has been very precious to you, high in your account, your joy, your tru&s;t, your foundation upon which you build your righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, your atonement, the chiefe&s;t among ten thou&s;ands, and altogether lovely, your all and in all. Again enquire: Is &s;in your burden? your grief, your abhorence? And do you abhor your&s;elf, and repent as in du&s;t in a&s;hes.' Can you &s;incerely an&s;wer the&s;e queries, and hone&s;tly apply all the&s;e rules of trial? If &s;o, then are ye Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples indeed, members of his true Church.</P>
