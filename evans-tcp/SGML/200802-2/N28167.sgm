<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND FELLOW-TOWNSMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER the many eloquent orations, the many &s;plendid eulogiums, which have &s;o late|ly attracted your attention, it is not without ex|treme diffidence I now venture to appear before you; but I tru&s;t your candor and genero&s;ity will receive, with indulgence, the feeble efforts of one who never had before the honor to addre&s;s a pub|lic and mixed a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>SCARCELY two months have elap&s;ed &s;ince we received the melancholy and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing tidings that <HI>our Wa&s;hington</HI> was no more! that quitting its earthly man&s;ion, his &s;ublime &s;oul had fled to mingle with the &s;pirits of Columbus and of Frank|lin.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037547_0004_100ED267F551BFF0">GENIUS has already exerted her powers, and fancy has di&s;played her brighte&s;t colourings, in attempting to portray the character of him who&s;e lo&s;s we are now a&s;&s;embled to deplore. The venerable &s;age and the youthful orator, have vied in extolling the virtues of this extraordinary man. But &s;till with tender anxiety, with filial &s;olicitude, we li&s;ten to and enquire after fre&s;h te&s;timonies of veneration and re&s;pect. Not content with the private effu&s;ions of gratitude and affection, the &s;u|preme authority of our country, in honor to the memory of her deare&s;t &s;on, has appointed this day, the anniver&s;ary of his birth, to be ob&s;erved as a day of mourning from one end of our empire to the other. Twice, my re&s;pected auditors, have you attended to hear from this place, ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the language of piety and religion, the ju&s;t prai&s;es of Wa&s;hington; but if I may be allow|ed to judge of the feelings which now po&s;&s;e&s;s you, you will think it no tre&s;pa&s;s on your time if I &s;hould recapitulate &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;triking and prominent periods in the hi&s;tory of this great man's life.</P>
<P>THOSE who are conver&s;ant in the annals of our country will readily recollect the fir&s;t glorious
<PB N="7" REF="037547_0005_100ED29B21D93CC8">
in&s;tance that, in the dawn of manhood, marked our Wa&s;hington as the fir&s;t of men.&mdash;When &s;carce|ly known to the military world, he re&s;cued from entire ruin the remnant of Braddock's defeated ho&s;t; 'twas then the Genius of America fir&s;t di&s;|played her guardian care in protecting her future &s;aviour from the &s;ecret ambu&s;cade and poi&s;oned arrow of Indian warfare. From this time, while he was maturing in years and acquiring that know|ledge and experience which expanded his opening mind, a revolution was preparing in the world that was to call forth all his powers. In the fir&s;t li&s;t of American worthies we find enrolled the name of George Wa&s;hington, from Virginia. 'Twas then, in the meridian of life, that his noble per&s;on, his ingenuous mind, his open and manly countenance, his firm and intrepid temper, pointed him to the di&s;criminating wi&s;dom of his illu&s;trious compeers; and with the univer&s;al con&s;ent of the patriots of the day, they appointed him to com|mand the armies of his country.</P>
<LG>
<L>From hence to trace him would indeed require</L>
<L>"An Angel's pencil, and a Seraph's fire!"</L>
</LG>
<P>With a mode&s;t di&s;tru&s;t of his talents, but with the firme&s;t reliance on the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, he
<PB N="8" REF="037547_0006_100ED29CD411FC38">
entered foremo&s;t on the theatre of our revolution; not like &s;ome modern heroes confiding &s;olely in human aid, but with an ardent and fervid zeal he implored the approbation and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his GOD.</P>
<P>AT Cambridge, in this Commonwealth, he commenced his con&s;picuous career. Here he was called upon to pa&s;s through the mo&s;t difficult and trying &s;cenes,&mdash;an army without di&s;cipline, offi|cers without military &s;kill, and no &s;upplies but &s;uch as were afforded by the precarious hand of uncertain fortune; but &s;urrendering to no difficul|ties, di&s;mayed by no appearances, he a&s;&s;umed the difficult duty, he reconciled the di&s;cordant minds of rival chiefs, he regulated the &s;trange fancies of unruly freemen, he brought them to act as one body, to unite in the capital blockade of Bo&s;ton; and thus drove the enemy from our &s;tate.</P>
<P>LET us now follow him to the next mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting and mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cene of all his life, to December 1776, when the gallant Howe, com|manding the veteran armies of Britain, arrayed in the &s;plendor of military uniformity, flu&s;hed with the &s;en&s;e of their &s;uperior di&s;cipline, pre&s;ented the dreadful phalanx, while the poor followers of Wa&s;hington trod with naked feet the frozen

grounds of Newj<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">y&mdash;'twas then, my friends, our <HI>liberties</HI> lay ga&s;ping&mdash;feeble minds were driven to de&s;pair&mdash;this was indeed "the time that tried men's &s;ouls;" every fal&s;e and hollow friend then retreated from the &s;cene&mdash;the &s;un&s;hine patriot hid his head, while the portentous heavens &s;hrouded their armory in black. Amid&s;t the jarring ele|ments, amid&s;t the wreck of matter, in the cru&s;h of contending armies, Wa&s;hington &s;tood unmoved; his great &s;oul felt no alarm&mdash;the eyes of the world were on him; in that perilous moment his mighty genius &s;ugge&s;ted, and he executed the ma&s;terly feat that has forever eclip&s;ed the victories of Han|nibal and Cae&s;ar. Moving in the rear of his ene|my, while they were plea&s;ing them&s;elves with the thought of &s;oon &s;wallowing up his little band, he captured 900 He&s;&s;ians, and filled with terror and di&s;may his valiant and a&s;toni&s;hed foe. Fain would I pur&s;ue this brave and illu&s;trious man through the after vici&s;&s;itudes of an eight years war, recount all his glorious exploits, all his magnanimous &s;trug|gles.&mdash;Fain would I drop a tear on the a&s;hes of the departed heroes who fell, while contending with him for the glorious prize.&mdash;Gladly would I condole with tho&s;e who will now renew the me|mory of a father, a hu&s;band, a &s;on, a brother, who,
<PB N="10" REF="037547_0008_100ED2D72AEBDAA0">
fighting for their country, under the command of Wa&s;hington, died nobly in the bed of honor; but I forbear. I will now come to that plea&s;ing and brilliant epoch when, at the head of triumphant armies, Victory placed his wide &s;preading &s;tandard on the battlements of York town, when, with joy|ful acclamations, we hailed him the conqueror of the great Cornwallis. Here the &s;ame magnanimi|ty of mind is &s;till di&s;tingui&s;hed&mdash;he is equally great in the hour of pro&s;perity, as in that of adver&s;ity&mdash;Not depre&s;&s;ed with the difficulties of mi&s;fortune, not dazzled with the brightne&s;s of &s;ucce&s;s, the we&s;tern gales wafted the intelligence abroad, and Great-Britain now learned that all attempts to &s;ub|due America were idle and ab&s;urd; that in Wa&s;h|ington was a &s;ucce&s;sful Sir William Wallace; and that the &s;pirit of her immortal ance&s;tors animated her &s;ons. Peace en&s;ued, and the eagle of Ameri|ca, on the wings of independence, &s;oared unmo|le&s;ted to the &s;kies; but the <HI>love of our country</HI> cooled. There was on foot a numerous army, who&s;e long and &s;evere &s;ervices called aloud for re&s;titution; who&s;e officers felt and expre&s;&s;ed the feelings natural to men. They had toiled&mdash;they had wa&s;ted the prime of life&mdash;they had given eve|ry thing to others, and they were without reward;
<PB N="11" REF="037547_0009_100ED3DFA5A275E0">
combining in a moment of unreflecting di&s;appoint|ment they determined never to lay down their arms till their claims were &s;atisfied; but that could not be&mdash;Wa&s;hington appeared among them&mdash;that rhetoric which had &s;o often been employed to rai&s;e their drooping hopes&mdash;that countenance that had &s;o often animated them in the day of bat|tle, again prevailed, and they &s;olemnly pledged them&s;elves rather to relinqui&s;h their pay, than tar|ni&s;h their dear earned honors.</P>
<P>TAKING now an affectionate and long fare|well of his brave companions in arms, he moved on to the place where Congre&s;s were then holding their &s;e&s;&s;ion, not clad in the helmet of &s;u&s;picion, no impenetrable lining to his wai&s;tcoat, but cloth|ed with the maje&s;ty of con&s;cious virtue, and erect with patriotic pride, he entered the augu&s;t a&s;&s;em|bly: no &s;ullen grenadier trod in his foot&s;teps; no ru&s;&s;ian with a dagger leaped forward to cut &s;hort his thread of life; no cries of outlawry a&s;&s;ailed his ears; but while &s;ilence reigned through the hall&mdash;while every heart beat high with hope&mdash;while every bo&s;om &s;welled with gratitude and love, and the rolling tear betrayed the amiable weakne&s;s of humanity, Wa&s;hington repo&s;ed on the
<PB N="12" REF="037547_0010_100ED3E16C1B9870">
altars of his country that commi&s;&s;ion which had enabled him to give liberty and empire to Ameri|ca! What a &s;pectacle for the admiring world! What a le&s;&s;on for conquerors! What an example for future heroes! That tongue which, on the pardon of Marcellus, &s;hook the Roman &s;enate with the prai&s;es of Cae&s;ar, mu&s;t here have been &s;i|lent; the feelings of that moment were too big for utterance, tears only could &s;peak the gratitude and admiration of his country. Well might the orator exclaim,
<Q>No flow of genius, no force of eloquence, no power of de&s;cription is &s;ufficient, I will not &s;ay, O Wa&s;hington, to embelli&s;h, but even to recount your deeds; yet this I affirm, and this with deference in&s;i&s;t upon, that from none of them will you reap greater glory than from that of this day.</Q></P>
<P>FROM this momentous cri&s;is the philo&s;opher and the hi&s;torian will go with him to the &s;hades of private life, to his beloved retreat, the elegant abode of Mount Vernon; there contemplate him engaged in the mo&s;t benevolent purpo&s;es, encour|ing the arts and &s;ciences, promoting every u&s;eful improvement, and &s;anctioning by his name and &s;ignature, every exertion to advance the honor
<PB N="13" REF="037547_0011_100ED93A361B41E0">
and reputation of his country. He was truly the patron of American merit. But what was now the &s;ituation of America?&mdash;a government without energy, reduced to the humble &s;tate of &s;eeking &s;upport by the futile means of requi&s;ition; a de|cline of public virtue, di&s;order and confu&s;ion in many of the &s;tates, and a rebellion in Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, &s;poke an empire falling to decay. All con&s;id|erate men &s;aw and lamented the exi&s;tence of &s;o feeble an edifice. But thanks be to GOD, there was virtue yet enough: a &s;trong confederation under a general government was propo&s;ed, was planned and adopted, and the con&s;titution of the United States, that &s;tupendous fabric, who&s;e adamantine pillars will, I hope, re&s;i&s;t the mouldering hand of time, publi&s;hed to America, &s;ub&s;cribed by Wa&s;h|ington, proclaimed us &s;aved.</P>
<P>AND now once more, the voice of his country, ever heard with veneration and love, called Wa&s;hington from retirement, a retirement which he had cho&s;en with the fonde&s;t predilection as the a&s;ylum of his declining years. The united and unanimous &s;uffrages of his fellow-citizens, pro|nounced him Pre&s;ident of the United States. How he conducted in this high and arduous &s;tation is
<PB N="14" REF="037547_0012_100ED93BF9945370">
well known to you all; dome&s;tic faction and in|ternal di&s;cord were hu&s;hed by his healing coun|&s;els. The &s;upple politicians, the artful and in|triguing mini&s;ter of a foreign nation, &s;tood aba&s;h|ed before his penetrating eye. All their &s;chemes to introduce among us the di&s;organizing princi|ples of France were baffled&mdash;all their plans were mildewed by his vigilance and virtue. As he had &s;hone fir&s;t in the ranks of war, he now &s;hone fir&s;t in the mild reign of peace. Having complet|ed nearly eight years of virtuous admini&s;tration, &s;eeing his beloved country greatly advanced in happine&s;s and pro&s;perity, and feeling the hand of time, he &s;ummoned us to attend his &s;olemn decli|nation. What we felt at that moment may po&s;&s;i|bly be conceived, but can never be de&s;cribed. To attempt to abridge that excellent performance would be indeed pre&s;umptuous. To &s;elect a plant, to cull a flower, would de&s;troy the &s;ymmetry of &s;o beautifully decorated a parterre; but let it be read and repeated by the old and young, and let the li&s;ping infant learn it with his prayers. Again Wa&s;hington withdrew with the plea&s;ing expecta|tion that he &s;hould now realize, without alloy, the &s;weet enjoyment of partaking, in the mid&s;t of his fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good
<PB N="15" REF="037547_0013_100ED93D9FD1A140">
laws under a free government; but this plea&s;ing hope &s;oon vani&s;hed&mdash;the &s;torm gathered thick, and clouds and darkne&s;s once more hung around us. Our commerce, the life, the &s;oul, the vital &s;pring of greatne&s;s, could not be pur&s;ued with its nece&s;|&s;ary freedom. French crui&s;ers covered the ocean; and the acquie&s;cence of the French government, in their ho&s;tile attacks, was a &s;ilent acknowledg|ment that it countenanced their unju&s;t proceed|ings. Our indignation at the&s;e unmerited in&s;ults was not &s;o great or &s;o prompt, as they provoked; but it at length bur&s;t forth, and a determined re|&s;i&s;tance to any further ho&s;tilities was the order of the day. Our &s;hips of war appeared as it were by enchantment on the ocean; and our gallant &s;ea|men &s;oon told the enemies of their trade that they feared them not. It was al&s;o thought nece&s;&s;ary that an army &s;hould be organized and prepared to meet occurrences as they ro&s;e. Every eye was turned to the man now to be appointed to com|mand that army. We heard the Genius of Ame|rica whi&s;pering the name of Wa&s;hington&mdash;that his &s;word, tho' &s;heathed, ru&s;ted not&mdash;that his &s;pirit, indignant at the in&s;ults offered to his country, glowed with its ancient ardor. The wi&s;dom of our Pre&s;ident &s;elected him, and the approving voice of the Senate confirmed the choice; and &s;oon the important communication was made to the Senate, to America, and to the World, that Wa&s;h|ington, after reviewing the conduct of France and the in&s;idious plans of her government, and reflect|ing that every thing we held dear and &s;acred was &s;eriou&s;ly threatened, had finally determined to ac|cept the commi&s;&s;ion of Commander in Chief of the
<PB N="16" REF="037547_0014_100ED93FBB944DD8">
Armies of the United States. Every fear then vani&s;hed, every arm was nerved, and we ju&s;tly counted on &s;ucce&s;s. But whither, my friends, does this bring us? alas! approaching to that &s;o|lemn &s;cene&mdash;to that awful period&mdash;to that never to be forgotten day, the 14th <HI>December,</HI> 1799, when the Sun of America, that had ari&s;en fair and clear, that advanced to and long &s;hone in meridian &s;plendor, that &s;inking had illumined the we&s;tern world, &s;et in glory&mdash;when Wa&s;hington, parting forever from his country, a&s;cended to his GOD. While the deepe&s;t mourning covered the face of the earth there was joy in heaven, and angels, trumpet-tongued, &s;ounded their loude&s;t hallelu|jahs. Ble&s;&s;ed are the dead which die in the Lord.</P>
<P>THUS, my friends, I have made a weak at|tempt to touch &s;ome of the outlines in the hi&s;tory and character of a man who, while living, was the greate&s;t ornament to the world, and who will ever be the theme of the virtuous and the good to the late&s;t generations. To &s;trive to imitate his bright example, and even to bear in mind his con&s;ider|ate precepts, is the fir&s;t duty of an American.</P>
<P>I CANNOT take leave without congratulating you on the pro&s;pect you have from the abilities of his great &s;ucce&s;&s;or&mdash;the pure integrity, the exalt|ed worth, the incorruptible patrioti&s;m of JOHN ADAMS&mdash;Oh! happy America! may thy guard|ian Angel hover round him, pre&s;erve his invalua|ble life, and long, long continue him&mdash;PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</P>
