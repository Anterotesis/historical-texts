<P>WHILE the tears of United America, are flowing for the fall of our illu&s;trious Chief, the beloved <HI>Washington,</HI> we are called upon, My Friends to mingle our own in the general <HI>stream.</HI>&mdash;O America! thou ha&s;t felt the &s;troke of the Almighty&mdash;thou ha&s;t &s;uffered an eclip&s;e&mdash;thy <HI>stars</HI> are &s;till permitted to &s;hine; but a por|tion of thy glory; <HI>one</HI> of thy brighte&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;hrouded in darkne&s;s.&mdash;Now, while grief <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> thy countenance, and the in&s;truments of mu&s;ic hang on the willows&mdash;while thou clothe&s;t thy|&s;elf with the cypre&s;s, and tears trickle down thy cheeks, remember thy GOD liveth&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e com|forted in this; for he &s;hall be thy Guardian and Defence.

<P>FIRST PLACE, That in concordance with our text, we are prompted to this duty by the ex|amples of GOD's children on &s;imilar occa&s;ions&mdash;as well as by the contemplation of our lo&s;s; whether we con&s;ider it in the light of an expe|rienced Commander, noble Patriot, enlightened Politician, or worthy Citizen&mdash;</P>
<P>But previou&s;ly to mentioning the obligations to the duty before us, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to no|tice, that while we indulge the natural feelings of grief, for the lo&s;s of an eminent Friend and Benefactor, the&s;e feelings are to be regulated by an holy &s;orrow for <HI>sin,</HI> which is the real ground of all our calamities. While our natural pa&s;|&s;ions are under the control and ab&s;orbed by a godly &s;orrow for &s;in, we may be &s;aid to comply with the duty of mourning with tho&s;e that mourn, and weeping with tho&s;e that weep&mdash;or the religious &s;orrow of this day. This kind of mourning is all which can render true honor to the dead&mdash;mend our own &s;ouls&mdash;or meet the di|vine approbation.&mdash;The obligations to this duty &s;hall now be hinted,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t&mdash;From the examples of GOD's children on &s;imilar occa&s;ions&mdash;</P>
<P>When the high Prie&s;t of GOD's ancient Church, fell a victim to the &s;troke of death up|on mount Hor, all I&s;rael grieved and lamented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him. It is &s;aid, "When all the congregation &s;aw that Aaron was dead, <HI>they mourned for him thirty days."</HI> This great and good man, having
<PB N="7" REF="037734_0006_1011C3EB68552260">
repeatedly &s;aved the lives of his brethren from immediate death, and being con&s;tituted the me|dium though whom their public prayers a&s;cend|ed to GOD, became greatly e&s;teemed and belov|ed&mdash;On his removal, the heart of every I&s;raelite melted with gratitude, at the remembrance of his &s;ervices&mdash;and the tender ties of nature and friend&s;hip bled in lengthy &s;treams when they were &s;eparated&mdash;</P>
<P>In like manner when the Mighty Law-giver re&s;igned his breath, on Pi&s;gah's top, it is written, "All the children of I&s;rael wept for him thirty days."&mdash;By this univer&s;al expre&s;&s;ion of grief, they manife&s;ted that they remembered, that <HI>Mo|ses was the man,</HI> who in the face of death, in every terrific form, delivered them from the iron furnace&mdash;their bitter &s;lavery in Egypt&mdash;who led them through the mighty deep on dry land; and gave them to triumph over their haughty foes&mdash;who endured, and hu&s;hed their murmurings in the wilderne&s;s&mdash;a&s;cended the fla|ming mount, and delivered them the law&mdash;Who fed them with angel's food, and gave them water from the rock&mdash;Who&s;e interce&s;&s;ions a multitude of times warded off the &s;troke of vengeance from their guilty heads&mdash;and who&s;e hand had conduc|ted them to the verge of their temporal Para|di&s;e.&mdash;But now, the mighty Mo&s;es is no more! How di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the thought, to tho&s;e who knew his worth, and &s;hared his kindne&s;&s;es! <HI>They Wept</HI>&mdash;Their deep and lengthy &s;orrow, proved how much they loved him&mdash;how much they re&s;pected him&mdash;how grateful they felt for what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had done&mdash;and how wide was the breach in his re|moval. And all this naturally led them, to their

own ill de&s;ert of &s;uch an eminent ble&s;&s;ing, and to that godly &s;orrow for &s;in, which in its con|&s;equences might excite them to imitate their il|lu&s;trious Benefactor, and hereby honor him for|ever&mdash;</P>
<P>To pa&s;s many in&s;tances; the lamentation in&s;tituted at the death of Saul and Jonathan is very impre&s;&s;ive. David, the man after GOD's own heart, compo&s;ed a &s;acred elegy to be &s;ung in their &s;olemn humiliations before GOD on this occa&s;ion. They fa&s;ted &s;even days, and lament|ed as in our context&mdash;"The beauty of I&s;rael is &s;lain upon the high places: how are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath, publi&s;h it not in the &s;treets of A&s;kelon; left the daughters of the Phi|li&s;tines rejoice, le&s;t the daughters of the uncir|cumci&s;ed triumph.&mdash;Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you, nor fields of offering: for there the &s;hield of the mighty is vilely ca&s;t away, the &s;hield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. From the blood of the &s;lain, from the fat of the mighty the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the &s;word of Saul returned not emp|ty. Saul and Jonathan were lovely and plea&s;ant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were &s;wifter than Eagles, they were &s;tronger than lions. Ye daughters of I&s;ra|el weep over Saul, who clothed you in &s;carlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of Gold upon your apparel. How are the mighty fallen in the mid&s;t of the battle: O Jonathan, thou wa&s;t &s;lain in thy high places. I am di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed for thee my brother Jonathan: very plea&s;ant ha&s;t thou been unto me: thy love to me was

wonderful, pa&s;&s;ing the love of women&mdash;How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed!!"</P>
<P>In this divine elegy, as well as in the exam|ples already brought, we are taught the &s;trict pro|priety which there is, in a people's uniting in manife&s;ting their heartfelt &s;orrow, at the fall of their greate&s;t temporal Benefactors.&mdash;Saul and Jonathan, were princes over I&s;rael; the former was the Lord's anointed and King in Je&s;hurun&mdash;The&s;e men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed commendable qualities in their high &s;tations&mdash;But now, when all their glo|ry is &s;tained by death: and all their en&s;igns of honor buried in the du&s;t of humiliation&mdash;pity, tenderne&s;s, gratitude and friend&s;hip, all &s;pring up at once, in the people's brea&s;ts and they mourn over them.&mdash;They dwell with the &s;ofte&s;t com|pa&s;&s;ion on every commendable deed or accom|pli&s;hment they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.&mdash;Ye daughters of I&s;rael weep over Saul, who <HI>clothed you in scarlet and other delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel</HI>&mdash;How are the mighty fallen! Their valour and heroi&s;m are mentioned&mdash;<HI>From the blood of the slain, the bow of Jonathan retur|ned not back: and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</HI> Likewi&s;e their agility of body&mdash;<HI>They were swifter than Eagles; they were stron|ger than Lions.</HI> Their plea&s;ant &s;ociety as com|panions&mdash;<HI>They were lovely and pleasant in their lives.</HI> But when they &s;peak of their deaths, the &s;cene is too tender for expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;the very ground is forbid to receive its natural refre&s;h|ment, and the &s;pot where they fell, condemned to perpetual barrenne&s;s&mdash;<HI>Ye mountains of Gil|boa Let there be no dew, neither rain upon you,
<PB N="10" REF="037734_0009_1011C3F6DE5E98E0">
nor fields of offerings: for there the shields of the mighty were vilely cast away</HI>&mdash;That is, Let the very ground mourn to all generations; for there the &s;trength and glory of man peri&s;hed. Finally, The calamity was too affecting to be touched by the profane bands of the wicked, or told where enemies might rejoice and triumph. <HI>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of &s;orrow, very forcibly evince how tenderly affected the people of GOD have been, at the decea&s;e of their temporal &s;overeigns, who have in any degree merited their affec|tions&mdash;</P>
<P>But one in&s;tance more &s;hall be mentioned&mdash;It is recorded, that when the great and good Prince Jo&s;iah fell, "he was buried in one of the &s;epul|chres of his Fathers, and all Judah and Jeru&s;alem mourned for Jo&s;iah. And Jeremiah lamented for Jo&s;iah: and all the &s;inging men and &s;inging women &s;pake of Jo&s;iah in their lamentations to this day&mdash;and made them an ordinance in I&s;rael and behold they are written in the lamenta|tions." This mourning was &s;o exceedingly deep and affecting, that ever afterward it was prover|bial. It is ob&s;erved by the Prophet Zechariah, &s;peaking of a time of affliction; "That in that day, there &s;hall be in Jeru&s;alem a great mourning as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Mag|iddon"&mdash;This was the time and place were Jo&s;i|ah was &s;lain.&mdash;All the millions of Judah wept with a &s;ore lamentation&mdash;Jeremiah compo&s;ed an elegy upon his death: and all the &s;inging men, and &s;inging women &s;pake of Jo&s;iah, and told of

his goodne&s;s in their lamentations to this day&mdash;that is, till their nation was broken up and di&s;|per&s;ed. And they ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> them a new ordinance in I&s;rael to remember and perpetuate his vir|tues. In addition to this it may be remarked, that the people of GOD in&s;tituted a regi&s;ter, in which were recorded the elegies and lamenta|tions which were made upon the deaths of good men. The&s;e &s;everal in&s;tances, &s;elected from a multitude, unite in placing before us the exam|ples of GOD's children, and demon&s;trate the du|ty and perfect propriety there is, in a people's unitedly expre&s;&s;ing the grief they feel upon the decea&s;e of their greate&s;t temporal benefactors and princes&mdash;That hereby they may expre&s;s their affection by pouring their tears upon their graves&mdash;call up into lively remembrance their virtues for imitation&mdash;attend to the voice of GOD in their removal&mdash;and prepare to follow them&mdash;</P>
<P>But my Friends, We did not need the exam|ples of primitive &s;aints to prompt us to a reluc|tant duty: but only to give us liberty to vent the &s;orrows we feel when the <HI>Death of a Wash|ington swells our breasts.</HI> But pau&s;e a moment!

Now commenced the bloody&punc; conte&s;t for every thing we held dear&mdash;The &s;ame Almighty Being, by who&s;e guidance we were hitherto conducted, beheld us with compa&s;&s;ion, and &s;aw what we needed; a PILOT, a LEAD|ER in the perilious enterprize we had undertak|en&mdash;He called for his Wa&s;hington already pre|pared; anointed him as his &s;ervant with regal dignity, and put into his hands, the control of all our defen&s;ive operations.

<P>But again, The tender and afflicted mind roves back, to view its object in brighter &s;cenes&mdash;When the man who had earned the love and e&s;teem of every American <HI>and the world,</HI> return|ed from the great theatre of action; clothed with the laurels of victory and triumph; the next thing which &s;trikes our admiration is, <HI>His Great Soul conquered Himself!</HI>&mdash;In &s;tead of im|proving his &s;ucce&s;&s;es to exalt and aggrandize his own per&s;on and name like other conquerors, he appeared before the grand Council of the nation&mdash;acknowledged all his &s;ucce&s;&s;es and glory, to be a&s;cribed to GOD; put up his earne&s;t prayer for his deare&s;t country and all to whom its in|tere&s;ts were intru&s;ted&mdash;re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion and took his leave of all public life. This act &s;o far demon&s;trated the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of his views, in the immen&s;e &s;ervices he had rendered his country, that it could hardly be thought to be the conduct of a mortal man. The affections

of the people glowed on him more than ever, and the world &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed!&mdash;</P>
<P>But the Lord of Ho&s;ts had &s;ervices for him &s;till.

Sufficient is it to &s;ay, <HI>No man uninspired</HI> could do better.

A te&s;timony of the complete &s;atisfaction which the people felt in his admini&s;tration, appeared in a &s;econd election to the &s;ame important office. Thus &s;eeming to take us by the hand and &s;et us out in the enjoy|ment of our dear bought privileges, confident of our &s;afety, he re&s;igned the helm of government

In this likewi&s;e we may &s;ee the di&s;plea&s;ure of Heaven&mdash;One of our "&s;tronge&s;t rods" is broken&mdash;our defence is &s;o far weakened: Hence in the &s;ame proportion we are expo&s;ed to calamities from abroad. The very name of our late Com|mander

was of more u&s;e than an army of no &s;mall magnitude&mdash;</P>
<P>While we mourn the lo&s;s of &s;o great a Bene|factor, it becomes us to look inwardly, and view the &s;ins of our own hearts and land; and con|fe&s;s them before GOD with deep penitence and humiliation. This will prove that we eye the hand of GOD in this afflictive &s;troke&mdash;are di&s;po&s;|ed to glorify him in it, and cleave to him &s;till&mdash;</P>
<P>Secondly&mdash;Being &s;o &s;en&s;ibly &s;truck with the lo&s;s of our Political Parent, let it excite us to put our tru&s;t in GOD more than ever. It would be infinitely criminal to lo&s;e &s;ight of the <HI>Source</HI> of all our comforts, and expectations&mdash;It was the <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> who rai&s;ed up our late Protec|tor&mdash;gave him all his accompli&s;hments and made him &s;ucce&s;sful in all the enterpri&s;es he performed&mdash;The &s;ame Being who rai&s;ed up Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, David, Cyrus and others. While we do honor to the man, and commend him for his public and private virtues, we are &s;till to remember he was only GOD's in&s;trument to do his work&mdash;The GOD of I&s;rael girded him, &s;upported him, and carried him through his momentous labors&mdash;We are obligated to ble&s;s and prai&s;e GOD infinitely more, than his in&s;trument. But as GOD has rai&s;ed up one Benefactor; Yea many; he can rai&s;e up others ju&s;t when he plea&s;|es&mdash;He can fill them with any degree of talents which his wi&s;dom dictates, and make them even &s;urpa&s;s their predece&s;&s;ors. To this &s;ource we are to look and pray, with the greate&s;t &s;incerity for the be&s;towment of all temporal and &s;piritual

ble&s;&s;ings. Tru&s;ting in GOD, we have nothing to fear&mdash;</P>
<P>Thirdly&mdash;If we would really honor the mighty &s;ubject of our lamentations we mu&s;t go farther than outward ceremony. We mu&s;t imitate him, in all things wherein he complied with the word of GOD&mdash;Could we now hear him addre&s;&s;ing us from the world of &s;pirits, what would he &s;ay? <HI>"Obey GOD"</HI> would be his language&mdash;"Love and &s;erve him with all thy heart, and &s;oul and &s;trength and mind"&mdash;We are fond of thinking the gates of Heaven were &s;et open, to receive his departing &s;pirit: <HI>Be it so;</HI> In this ca&s;e his exhor|tation to his Friends here below, would be pre|ci&s;ely <HI>the language of angels, or the word of GOD.</HI> Were he to &s;peak with an audible voice and ex|hort in the language of Paradi&s;e he would &s;ay, "Repent and believe in Chri&s;t: there is none o|ther name given under Heaven whereby ye can be &s;aved&mdash;Fly to the Lord Je&s;us, the captain of your &s;alvation and take hold on eternal life. If you ever mean to be my company, you mu&s;t <HI>become holy,</HI> for without holine&s;s no man can &s;ee GOD&mdash;Break off your iniquities&mdash;fly from the wrath which is coming&mdash;make your calling and election &s;ure&mdash;Serve GOD and your generation with your whole heart&mdash;And if you would honor me and mourn my ab&s;ence, <HI>so live</HI> as to come and dwell where I am"&mdash;Now, if we would honor Him, in his death, who was &s;o dear to us in life, let us hear his addre&s;s from the Heavenly man&s;ion, where we hope his &s;pirit lives&mdash;Let us practice it; and this will prove we re&s;pect him, and hold him in everla&s;ting remembrance&mdash;This will be joining in the religious &s;orrow of this day, and gain &s;piritual advantage to our &s;ouls.</P>

Fourthly&mdash;The event we contemplate teaches us, that Death, is our certain lot&mdash;If a Wa&s;hing|ington is dead&mdash;if the King of terrors would not be bribed when &s;uch a victim &s;tood before him, then we mu&s;t die&mdash;O Let the light and trifling, the bu&s;y and the gay, think of <HI>this,</HI> and feel that they are dead men&mdash;The devout know it already. But &s;ince this is our certain end, can there be a wi&s;er cour&s;e than to prepare for it? Do we wi&s;h for Heaven? Do we wi&s;h, when we clo&s;e our eyes on earth, to be gathered with angels and &s;aints, and all the honorable and mighty who have died in faith&mdash;if &s;o, to devote our|&s;elves to the &s;ervice of GOD will carry us thith|er? But any other cour&s;e will land us without end, with hypocrites and unbelievers.&mdash;Shall we lavi&s;h our prai&s;es on the righteous&mdash;mourn their deaths&mdash;accompany them with our wi&s;hes to Hea|ven's gate, and yet by our daily practice prove we have no &s;erious meaning in all this? Shall we look upon death ju&s;t as certain, as our exi&s;t|ence, yet make no preparation to meet it! O Let it not be&mdash;but let it be our &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s to acquire a temper of mind &s;uited to the Heaven|ly world, and to follow the foot&s;teps of tho&s;e who through faith and patience inherit the pro|mi&s;es&mdash;Then, when the moment of di&s;&s;olution arrives, the tran&s;ition will be glorious, and the &s;ociety we &s;hall enter will be pure and delight|&s;ome beyond all our pre&s;ent conceptions.&mdash;</P>
<P>Finally&mdash;This day, My Friends, finds a &s;able cloud &s;pread over our whole country, and &s;uch gloomy ve&s;tments as never &s;hadowed it before&mdash;and all this for the fall of one man, a fellow mor|tal!&mdash;But how &s;trikingly ought this to remind us
