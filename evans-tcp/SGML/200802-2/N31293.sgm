<P>And he took a Child, and &s;et him in the mid&s;t of them: and when he had taken him in his Arms, he &s;aid unto them, Who&s;oever &s;hall receive one of &s;uch Children in my Name, re|ceiveth me; and who&s;oever &s;hall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that &s;ent me.</P></Q>

<P>_A Great deal might be &s;aid from this Text; that concerns <HI>Parents,</HI> and other grown Per&s;ons; but I &s;hall only take Notice of that which concerns <HI>Children.</HI> Note here, (1) The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>ob&s;erves</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Chil|dren: He takes Notice of them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> his

<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> Chri&s;t takes Notice of little Children, and loves them dearly, if they be good Children.</P>
<P>Your Parents don't love you a thou&s;andth Part &s;o much (nor you your&s;elves) as Chri&s;t does, if you be good Children.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t Propo&s;ition. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t takes Notice of all little Children.</HI> He ob&s;erved you, before you came hither, and as you were in coming: And he takes Notice of you now while you are here. If any of you are <HI>weary,</HI> and want to be gone Home, or to get out to Play, Chri&s;t ob&s;erves it. He minds who are <HI>affected</HI> with the Sermon, and who are not; who they are that are <HI>carele&s;s,</HI> and don't mind what is &s;aid; and e&s;pecially if any are &s;o wicked as to <HI>play,</HI> while they &s;hould be hearing. He takes No|tice how you behave your&s;elves <HI>at Home</HI>: Whe|ther you are dutiful to your Parents, &amp; loving to your Brothers and Si&s;ters; or whether you be di&s;obedient and fretful, rude, or quarrel&s;ome. He minds what you &s;ay and do when you are <HI>Abroad,</HI> and as you are going to <HI>School.</HI> He

&s;ees how you &s;pend the <HI>Saturday Night,</HI> whe|ther you are willing to &s;ay your Catechi&s;m; and on <HI>Sabbath Day Morning,</HI> how you &s;pend your Time, whether you get alone, and read and think and pray; or are idle, and do no|thing, or play, which is wor&s;e; and what you do <HI>all Day.</HI> You read (Mal. 3.16) <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>hearkened and heard, and a Book of Remembrance was written before him.</HI> He &s;ets down in his Book, all that you &s;ay, and do, and think, when you are <HI>alone,</HI> and when in <HI>Company,</HI> and <HI>where|ever</HI> you are.

<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Becau&s;e he is every where pre&s;ent.</HI> As <HI>David</HI> &s;peaks in the Beginning of the Hundred and thirty-ninth P&s;alm; <HI>O Lord thou ha&s;t &s;earch|ed me, &amp; known me. Thou knowe&s;t my down &s;itting and mine up-ri&s;ing; thou under&s;tande&s;t my Tho'ts afar off. Thou compa&s;&s;e&s;t my Path, and my lying down; and art acquainted with all my Ways. For there is not a Word in my Tongue, but O Lord, thou knowe&s;t it altogether. Thou ha&s;t be|&s;et me behind and before, and laid thine Hand up|on me. Such Knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. Whither &s;hall I go from thy Pre&s;ence? Or whither &s;hall I flee

from thy Spirit? If I a&s;cend up into Heaven, thou art there: If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there. If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the uttermo&s;t Parts of the Sea, even there &s;hall thy Hand lead me, and thy right Hand &s;hall hold me. If I &s;ay, Surely the Darkne&s;s &s;hall cover me, even the Night &s;hall be Light about me. Yea, the Darkne&s;s hideth not from thee; but the Night &s;hineth as the Day; the Darkne&s;s and the Light are both alike to thee.</HI>&mdash;Children, I &s;ee you now &s;itting before me: Your Parents that are at Home, don't &s;ee you: But Chri&s;t &s;ees you <HI>always</HI>; for he is <HI>every where.</HI> The An|gels can't be every where; they can't be in two Places at once; but Chri&s;t can. He knows your <HI>Tho'ts.</HI> He knew a Thou&s;and Years ago, what you would be thinking of now. He knew how many Times you would wi&s;h in your Hearts, O that God's Spirit would help the Mini&s;ter in preaching! O that I might get &s;ome Good to Day! and the like. And he &s;ets down your Tho'ts in his Book.&mdash;He knows all the <HI>Words</HI> you &s;peak, good and bad; and from what <HI>Heart</HI> they come. You can't <HI>under&s;tand</HI> how he can be every where at once; but he is &s;o, he is all over the World, here and

at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and at the farthe&s;t Part of the Sea; we mu&s;t believe it. He is in Heaven, and in Hell, at the &s;ame Time; in the Dark, as well as in the Light. He &s;ees all the <HI>Sins,</HI> that you commit in <HI>&s;ecret,</HI> and &s;ets them all down. Yet if you <HI>believe</HI> in Chri&s;t, and are truly <HI>&s;orry</HI> for your Sins, they will be <HI>all blotted out</HI>: But your <HI>good</HI> Tho'ts, Words, and Actions will be &s;et down, and never blotted out. There is Room enough in his Book, to &s;et down all the good Things done by you; more Room than there would be in this great Bible, if it were all clean Paper.</P>
<P><HI>Good Children,</HI> you are Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciples, his Scholars; and he <HI>knows</HI> that you love him. It may be your <HI>Parents</HI> don't know that you love Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but he knows it. When you pray alone, you may &s;ay as <HI>Peter</HI> did, <HI>Lord thou knowe&s;t all Things, thou knowe&s;t that I love thee.</HI> And if Chri&s;t knows <HI>all Things,</HI> then be &s;ure he always ob&s;erves <HI>little Children.</HI> In the ninth of <HI>Matthew,</HI> and the fourth Ver&s;e&punc; 'tis &s;aid, <HI>Je&s;us knowing their Tho'ts &s;aid, Why think ye Evil in your Hearts?</HI> He ob&s;erves every particular Child. There was one <HI>Nathanael,</HI> once&punc; that u&s;ed to go alone, under a Tree to pray; and
<PB N="8" REF="041399_0007_101A7EE61FB0D2D0">
Chri&s;t <HI>&s;aw</HI> him, and told him of it. He did not then think, Chri&s;t could <HI>&s;ee</HI> him, but he did. Some of you love to get alone among the Bu&s;hes to pray; and you did not think it may be, that Chri&s;t <HI>&s;ee</HI> you; but he did. Chri&s;t can &s;ay, I &s;aw you <HI>John,</HI> you <HI>Sarah,</HI> whatever your Name is. I tell you &s;o in his Name; and that's all one as if <HI>he</HI> told you &s;o. He &s;aw you there la&s;t <HI>Night,</HI> in &s;uch a Place <HI>alone,</HI> and this <HI>Morning</HI> in &s;uch a Place <HI>alone.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Little Children are committed to him to keep</HI>; and therefore he takes Notice of them. In &s;ome Places there is a <HI>Shepherd</HI> ap|pointed to <HI>keep</HI> the Sheep. Chri&s;t is the <HI>good Shepherd.</HI> Your godly Parents are the <HI>Sheep,</HI> and you are the <HI>Lambs.</HI> The Devil is the <HI>Wolf,</HI> that goes to carry you away by his Temptati|ons; but if you love Chri&s;t, he will watch over you, to keep you from Satan's Temptations. All the Angels in Heaven could not keep you; but Chri&s;t can. And he does keep you from a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> any Harms. You are Chri&s;t's own little Lambs, and you are now in his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> when you come to Meeting, and he is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> you with his <HI>Word</HI>: He brought you here <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Purpo&s;e to <HI>feed</HI> you. How &s;weet will this be
<PB N="9" REF="041399_0008_101A7EE86CA5E6B0">
to them that love Chri&s;t? You are &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>other Sheep</HI> that were not of that Fold of the <HI>Jews,</HI> which Chri&s;t &s;ays, <HI>He mu&s;t bring in.</HI> A Shepherd will look after his Sheep. That is &s;poken of Chri&s;t, in the fortieth of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> and the eleventh: <HI>He &s;hall feed his Flock, like a Shepherd; he &s;hall gather the Lambs in his Arms, and carry them in his Bo&s;om, and &s;hall gently lead tho&s;e that are with Young.</HI> If there be a <HI>Lamb</HI> that is left behind, or one that is Weak, or Lame, or Sick, and can't go, the <HI>Shepherd</HI> will look after it: So Chri&s;t will pitty and help you, when you have Souls &s;ick and wounded by Sin, and can't help your&s;elves. When the <HI>Wolf</HI> comes, the Shepherd frights him away: So Chri&s;t will fright away the <HI>Devil,</HI> when he comes to tempt you, if you commit your&s;elves to him, and cry to him, believing and repenting. He has led your good Parents all along; and &s;o he will do you that are good Children.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>If Chri&s;t did</HI> not <HI>take Notice of little Children, how could he judge them at the la&s;t Day, as he mu&s;t do?</HI> 'Tis &s;aid, <HI>God &s;hall judge the Secrets of Men by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And <HI>John</HI> in the Revelation, <HI>&s;aw the Dead, &s;mall and great &s;tand before God; and the Books were opened, and the
<PB N="10" REF="041399_0009_101A7EEAB45260F0">
Dead were judged out of tho&s;e Things which were written in the Books, according to their Deeds.</HI> Now how could he judge the World, if he did not know the Thoughts, Words and Actions of all? How could he &s;entence wicked Children to Hell, and good Children to Hea|ven, if he had not taken Notice of them all along their Lives? You read in the twelfth of <HI>Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tes,</HI> and the fourteenth, <HI>God &s;hall bring eve|ry Work into Judgment, with every &s;ecret Thing, whether it be Good or whether it be Evil.</HI></P>
<P>The U&s;e of the Doctrine, is for <HI>Warning</HI> to Children. Fir&s;t, Be dutiful Children. Be dutiful to God; be dutiful to your Parents. Be diligent&punc; at the Work you are &s;et about. Love and mind your Book; take all Oppor|tunities to read. Do all the Good you can. Be quick and faithful, when you are &s;ent of an Errand. Be &s;ure don't fail to pray alone, Morn|ing and Evening, every Day. Hear what your Saviour &s;ays, in <HI>Matthew; Thou, when thou praye&s;t, enter into thy Clo&s;et, and pray to thy Fa|ther which is in &s;ecret; and thy Father which &s;eeth in &s;ecret, &s;hall reward thee openly.</HI> Think often about Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It is he that is &s;po|ken of in <HI>I&s;aiah; To us a Son is born, to us a
<PB N="11" REF="041399_0010_101A7EEDAB89DFC0">
Child is given, his Name &s;hall be called Wonder|ful, Councellor, the Mighty God, the everla&s;ting Father, the Prince of Peace.</HI> Believe that he always &s;ees you If you can find a Place to Sin in, &s;o dark or &s;ecret, that Chri&s;t can't &s;ee you, you may venture to do what you will there, but indeed there is no &s;uch Place in all the World. Always remember you mu&s;t have <HI>Help</HI> from him, to do every Duty, and to keep you from Sin. Don't dare to do any Thing alone that is bad, any more than you would here, when we are all looking on you. If you do, Chri&s;t will &s;ay to you in the Day of, Judgment, What! were you more afraid of <HI>Men,</HI> than of <HI>Me</HI> your Judge? If your Parents will bear with you in your Wickedne&s;s, Chri&s;t will not.&mdash;Come to Meeting always when you can; but if you hap|pen to &s;tay at Home, remember that Chri&s;t &s;ees you all Day long. If I were to &s;tay at Home with you, would you play? But Chri&s;t is al|ways there. You can't think one evil Thought, but Chri&s;t will know it, &amp; all the World will know it in the Day of Judgment. But if you repent and believe in Chri&s;t, all your <HI>Sins</HI> will be <HI>blot|ted out,</HI> and all the World &s;hall know what good Children you have been. All the Good that
<PB N="12" REF="041399_0011_101A7EEF34CF4D68">
ever you did, or &s;aid, or thought, will be read before all Angels and Men.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Propo&s;ition is, That Chri&s;t <HI>loves good Children dearly.</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>Who are good Children?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The&s;e are &s;ome of the Marks of good Children: They are afraid to Sin <HI>alone,</HI> and in the <HI>Dark,</HI> as much as if every Body were looking upon them. Such are careful of what they &s;peak, &amp; what they think. Good Chil|dren are glad when <HI>Sabbath</HI> comes, that they may go to Meeting, and hear God's Word. They don't dare to di&s;obey or mutter at their <HI>Parents,</HI> even, tho' they forbear to correct them for it. They <HI>fear</HI> God, who will puni&s;h wick|ed Children in Hell. They &s;ay with them&s;elves, I had rather my Parents, or any Body, &s;hould be angry with me, than God &s;hould. 'Tis the <HI>Fear</HI> of God, that <HI>keeps them from Evil.</HI> Some Parents won't correct their Children, when they do wickedly; but God will take &s;uch Children into his own Hands. Good Children think of this, and are afraid, They think about their Souls, when they are alone; and are afraid &s;ometimes that they have no Grace; they think their Hearts are &s;o wicked, that there can't be
<PB N="13" REF="041399_0012_101A7EF1711F0320">
any Grace there. They are <HI>&s;orry</HI> for their <HI>Sins</HI>; &s;orry that they have offended God and Chri&s;t, and grieved the Holy Spirit. They love to think about Je&s;us Chri&s;t. They think of him a Thou&s;and Times; as they are lying down, and ri&s;ing up, and going about from one Place to another. Think about their Parents or Bro|thers or Si&s;ters that are dead and gone; think where they are now. They de&s;ire to know Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, more than any Thing. His <HI>Love</HI> is better to them than all the World.&mdash;Wicked Children don't love &s;uch Things. They don't really believe there is a God and Chri&s;t, a Hea|ven and a Hell; nor don't love to think of them: But good Children do. The&s;e play &s;ometimes, a little; and there is no hurt in it; but they are often thinking of Chri&s;t, while they are at their Play.</P>
<P>Another Que&s;tion is, <HI>How does it appear, that</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>loves good Children, and why does he love them?</HI></P>
<P>I An&s;wer, Fir&s;t, <HI>It is becau&s;e his Father gave them to him.</HI> If a Father gives his little Child a Lamb, he will be very choice of that Lamb: So Chri&s;t loves little Children, the Lambs that his Father gave him.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="041399_0013_101A7EF3088B8BB8">Secondly, Chri&s;t loves good Children <HI>becau&s;e there are &s;o few of them.</HI> Of all the Children that are here, it may be, there are not above <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three</HI> in a Seat, that are <HI>Good:</HI> And won't Chri&s;t love <HI>them,</HI> think you? It may be, there are not above <HI>twenty</HI> good-Children in all this Town; and &s;urely Chri&s;t loves them. It may be, all the Children in the Fa|mily are wicked, but you: And will not Chri&s;t love you then? Men prize Gold, be|cau&s;e there is but little of it; &s;o does Je&s;us Chri&s;t value his Jewels: <HI>Luke</HI> the twelfth, and the fortieth, <HI>Fear not</HI> Little <HI>Flock; it is your Father's good Plea&s;ure to give you the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Je&s;us loves good Children dearly, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> they co&s;t him dear. If a Man buys a Creature at a dear Rate, he will &s;et much by it. Good Children co&s;t Je&s;us Chri&s;t more than all this World. He bought them with his <HI>precious Blood.</HI> All the Gold and Silver in the World, would not have purcha&s;ed one of Chri&s;t's Lambs.</P>
<P>Fourthly, He loves little Children that are good, <HI>becau&s;e they are like him</HI>; his <HI>Image</HI> is &s;tamped upon them. Parents love their Chil|dren, that are like them, and act like them: So does Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="041399_0014_101A7EF69B086CE8">Again, He loves them <HI>becau&s;e they are related to him.</HI> They are his Children. He &s;ays con|cerning them, <HI>Here am I, and the Children that God has given me,</HI> Some of you have no Fa|ther on Earth; but if you be good Children, Chri&s;t is your Father.&mdash;You are his <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> his <HI>Spou&s;e.</HI> Never any Man loved a Spou&s;e, &s;o as Chri&s;t loves good Children. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays to the Corinthians, <HI>I have e&s;pou&s;ed you as a cha&s;t Vir|gin to</HI> Chri&s;t.&mdash;And as I told you before, he is the good <HI>Shepherd,</HI> and you are the <HI>Lambs</HI> of his Flock.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Good Children <HI>do what plea&s;es</HI> Chri&s;t; and therefore he loves them. They are often thinking with them&s;elves, Will this or that be plea&s;ing to Chri&s;t? and if they think it will, they do it; or el&s;e, they will not. Wick|ed Children don't care whether they plea&s;e Chri&s;t or no; if they can but plea&s;e them&s;elves, and their wicked Companions. But good Children are of another Mind: They go alone, and pray, Morning and Evening, becau&s;e Chri&s;t has bid them do &s;o; they do it to plea&s;e him. As Chri&s;t <HI>always did tho&s;e Things that plea&s;ed his Father</HI> &s;o to his Children; and will not he love them then?</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="041399_0015_101A7EF8242FBBA0">Seventhly, and la&s;tly, Chri&s;t loves little Chil|dren, <HI>becau&s;e he</HI> will <HI>love them.</HI> He &s;ays to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>Ye have not cho&s;en me, but I have cho|&s;en you.</HI> They are as bad by Nature, as others; but he loves them freely. <HI>When my Father and my Mother for&s;ake me</HI> (&s;ays David) <HI>then the Lord will take me up.</HI> And in the &s;ixteenth of <HI>Eze|kiel,</HI> the Lord &s;ays to his People, <HI>When thou wa&s;t in thy Blood, ca&s;t out to the loathing of thy Per&s;on, I &s;aid unto thee,</HI> Live: <HI>Yea, I &s;aid unto thee, when thou wa&s;t in thy Blood,</HI> Live: <HI>And the Time was the Time of Love.</HI> He might have loved others, and have left you to peri&s;h in your Sins.</P>
<P>U&s;e Fir&s;t. If Chri&s;t loves good Children, <HI>then &s;urely he hates wicked Children.</HI> Poor wick|ed Child, do&s;t think that Je&s;us Chri&s;t loves thee! No, he hates the Wicked. And if you live &amp; die wicked, you'l find at la&s;t that he hates you as bad as he does the <HI>Devil.</HI> You &s;erve the <HI>Devil</HI>; you do as he bids you; you are his Child, and Chri&s;t is angry with you for doing <HI>his Works.</HI> He may &s;end <HI>Indians</HI> to kill you. He threatens to <HI>kill wicked Children with Death.</HI> As the Wolf comes and catches and carries away the Lambs; &s;o God may &s;end the Indians to carry you away.
<PB N="17" REF="041399_0016_101A7EFBECA7C728">
God &s;ent two <HI>She-Bears</HI> once to tare <HI>forty and two Children in</HI> Pieces, becau&s;e they <HI>mocked</HI> an old bald-headed Mini&s;ter. Sometimes, it may be <HI>you</HI> mock Folks. You may be carried away by the Indians, and die in the Woods; and <HI>the Ravens of the Valley may pick out your Eyes,</HI> and <HI>the young Eagles may eat them.</HI> So it was with a Child at <HI>Cape-Neddick</HI>: and &s;o it may again.</P>
<P>U&s;e Second. If the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> Children that are, will <HI>leave</HI> their <HI>wicked</HI> Ways, and become <HI>good</HI> Children, then Chri&s;t will <HI>love</HI> them. He will forget &amp; forgive all their Sins. Tho' <HI>they</HI> remem|ber their Sins, and bemoan them&s;elves, yet he will forget and forgive. He will &s;ay, as in <HI>Jere|my</HI> thirty fir&s;t and eighteenth, <HI>I have &s;urely heard</HI> Ephraim <HI>bemoaning him&s;elf thus: Thou ha&s;t cha&s;|ti&s;ed me, &amp; I was cha&s;ti&s;ed, as a Bullock unaccu&s;tom|ed to the Yoke; Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turn|ed; for thou art the</HI> LORD my GOD. <HI>Surely after that I was turned, I repented; after that I was in&s;tructed, I &s;mote upon my Thigh: I was a&s;hamed, yea, even confounded, becau&s;e I did bear the Reproach of my Youth. Is</HI> Ephraim my dear Son? <HI>is he a plea&s;ant Child? for &s;ince I &s;pake again&s;t him, I do earne&s;tly remember him &s;till: therefore my Bowels are troubled for him; I will
<PB N="18" REF="041399_0017_101A7EFD742ABC80">
&s;urely have Mercy on him, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> So Chri&s;t will &s;peak of <HI>you,</HI> if you become good Children. He will &s;ay, <HI>It is my dear Child, I will &s;urely have Mercy on him.</HI> This I tell you to encourage you. Tho' you have been very wicked, yet if you return to him, he will receive you into the Arms of his Love.</P>
<P>U&s;e third, of Caution. <HI>It's dangerous delay|ing to become good Children.</HI> If you put it off one Fortnight, or one Day longer, God may cut you off, or give you up; and hear none of your Cries, when you come to be in Di&s;tre&s;s. There was a little Boy at <HI>Hampton,</HI> that was at play with the Children, and he told them, They mu&s;t be good Children, becau&s;e if they were not good <HI>now</HI> they were <HI>Children,</HI> they might <HI>never</HI> be good; for they might never live to grow up. And within a few Days after <HI>he</HI> died.</P>
<P>USE fourth for Direction. <HI>You mu&s;t pray to</HI> God <HI>and</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>to make you good Children, to teach you to love, &amp; fear, and &s;erve him.</HI> And do you think if you do earne&s;tly &s;eek to him, that he will not do it for you! Your Parents will be glad of it: and will not Chri&s;t rejoyce in it? A&s;k Coun&s;el of your Parents and Neighbours, how you &s;hall do to be good Children: And
<PB N="19" REF="041399_0018_101A7EFFAAAFFA80">
de&s;ire them to pray for you. You mu&s;t mourn for your Sins, and believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. You mu&s;t believe, that he always &s;ees you. You mu&s;t believe, that he is able and will|ing to &s;ave you, and you mu&s;t depend upon him for Grace, and Glory, and all that you want. Remember what you have heard, and &s;ay within your &s;elves, Chri&s;t <HI>always &s;ees me.</HI> It is the <HI>Devil</HI> that tempts you to forget Chri&s;t, and to Sin again&s;t him. Think of <HI>dying</HI> in a &s;hort Time. Little <HI>Elizabeth Banks</HI> and <HI>Richard Banks</HI> are dead and gone: you don't know, how &s;oon <HI>you</HI> may be called to go after them.&mdash;Don't plea&s;e your &s;elves with childi&s;h Vanities, with fine Cloaths, and the like. But get the <HI>Wedding Gar|ment of</HI> Chri&s;t's <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> and come to his Supper. You may come to the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> if you are not above thirteen or fourteen Years old: &s;ome have done &s;o&mdash;Think how dread|ful it will be to go to <HI>Hell.</HI> You can't bear to hold your Hand in the Fire one Minute: and how will you bear to lie in a <HI>Lake of Fire and Brim&s;tone</HI> for ever?&mdash;When you are tempted to <HI>neglect</HI> praying alone, &s;ay, No, I cannot, I mu&s;t not. It may be, there may be &s;ome <HI>Child</HI> here, that has a Thou&s;and Prayers &s;et down to
<PB N="20" REF="041399_0019_101A7F0131F81570">
his Account. And if <HI>you</HI> will begin now, your Prayers will be &s;et down too.&mdash;Own the Cove|nant, and &s;o give up your &s;elves to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>U&s;e the fifth, for Encouragement. <HI>Tho' it be a very hard Thing to be good Children, yet</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>can make it ea&s;y, and he will do &s;o.</HI> Wi&s;dom's Ways are Ways of <HI>Plea&s;antne&s;s,</HI> &amp; all her Paths are <HI>Peace.</HI> Chri&s;t has &s;aid, <HI>I love tho&s;e that love me; and they that &s;eek me early, &s;hall find me.</HI> You'l &s;ay, I find more Comfort in reading, praying, &amp; think|ing about CHRIST, than ever I did in playing and &s;inning. The Service of CHRIST is more Plea&s;ant, even for the pre&s;ent, than the Service of the Devil. And it is <HI>ea&s;ier</HI> to turn to God <HI>now,</HI> than it will be when you are grown older. The longer you live in Sin, the harder your Hearts will grow, and the le&s;s Mind you will have to repent. You mu&s;t come to Chri&s;t <HI>pre&s;ently,</HI> or it may be too late for ever. If your Parents &s;ee you begin to be concern'd, &amp; to &s;eek God, they will pray for you, and encourage you. And <HI>good Children</HI> will be helpful to you. A little Boy not above <HI>four</HI> Years old, was found teaching his Si&s;ter what he knew about God and Chri&s;t, and heavenly Things. <HI>You</HI> are older than that, and therefore, 'tis <HI>high Time</HI> for you to &s;eek the
<PB N="21" REF="041399_0020_101A7F03823E3800">
Lord. If you once begin, all God's People will pray for you. God has promi&s;ed to <HI>pour out his Spirit on his People,</HI> &amp; <HI>his Ble&s;&s;ing on their Offspring.</HI> God will rain down his Grace upon you. He has &s;aid, <HI>All thy Children &s;hall be taught of GOD; and great &s;hall be the Peace of thy Children.</HI> Chri&s;t is praying for you now in Heaven.</P>
<P>But for your <HI>Terror,</HI> let me tell you, that if you don't <HI>&s;peedily turn to the</HI> Lord, it will not be long before you will be burning and roaring in <HI>Hell</HI>: Then you will think of what you now hear, and will think of it for ever. Chri&s;t is <HI>angry with you every Day.</HI> Can you bear to go to Hell? Your Hearts are harder than Iron if you can think of it without trembling. I am per&s;waded &s;ome of you will be gone for ever in a few Weeks, if you are not converted. Some of you I'm afraid, are grown <HI>dead ripe in Sin</HI> alrea|dy: And when you come to &s;tand before, the <HI>Judgment Seat</HI> of CHRIST, I will witne&s;s again&s;t you; and your Parents will witne&s;s again&s;t you. And what will you do, when you come to be <HI>bound Hand and Foot,</HI> and flung into the Mouth of the burning bottomle&s;s Pit? You'l cry but, O I can't go down there! but go you mu&s;t, and lie there forever.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="041399_0021_101A7F066893A648">USE la&s;t, Of Comfort to <HI>good Children</HI>; and to wicked Children too, that will now be|gin to be good. Some of you have good <HI>Parents</HI> now in <HI>Heaven.</HI> And if you are good, Chri&s;t <HI>loves</HI> you, and will &s;end his ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Angels</HI> to look after you. Chri&s;t &s;ays, that good Children's <HI>Angels always behold the Face of his Father which is in Heaven.</HI> You will have the <HI>Good</HI> of every Thing, Mercies will do you Good, and Afflictions will do you Good.&mdash;You &s;hall <HI>live with CHRIST,</HI> and lie in his Bo&s;om forever: When Chri&s;t comes again, and that will be quickly, then he will own you before all the World, and tell of your Love to him, and of all your good Tho'ts, your good Words and Deeds; and when the World is &s;et all on a light Fire (as the Bible tells us it &s;hall be at CHRIST's coming) He will take you up to be with him, and with the good Angels, and with your good Parents, and with all good People, for ever and ever.</P>

<HEAD>A few Lines Recommended by a Father to his CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<L>UNTO the LORD, in Morning I,</L>
<L>In JESUS's Name, will pray and cry,</L>
<L>For his &s;weet Grace, which he will give,</L>
<L>That to his Glory I may live.</L>
<L>At Ev'ning too, and Noon each Day,</L>
<L>Will not forget to Prai&s;e and Pray;</L>
<L>And in Ejaculations near,</L>
<L>Will oft unto my God repair.</L>
<L>His precious Word I'll daily read,</L>
<L>And on his Promi&s;es will feed.</L>
<L>Thro' Grace, with Sin I'll freely part,</L>
<L>And to my Saviour yield my Heart.</L>
<L>With God all Day, and in his Fear</L>
<L>Will walk, and prove my&s;elf &s;incere.</L>
<L>On CHRIST, my Surety, I depend,</L>
<L>For Strength, which He from Heav'n will &s;end.</L>
<L>That I to him the&s;e Vows may pay,</L>
<L>And never from him go a&s;tray.</L>
<L>His Merit likewi&s;e I mu&s;t-plead,</L>
<L>For Pardon, which I daily need.</L>
<L>May I be found in CHRIST at length,</L>
<L>Who is my Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Strength.</L>
