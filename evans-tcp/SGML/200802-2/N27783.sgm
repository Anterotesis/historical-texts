<HEAD>A DISCOURSE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an ob&s;ervation of the wi&s;e&s;t of men, that <HI>"to every thing there is a &s;ea&s;on, and a time to every purpo&s;e under heaven."</HI> Tho' every day and every hour comes charged with &s;ome impor|tant duty; yet wi&s;dom will di&s;cern, in that &s;trik|ing &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of affecting events, with which the life of man is diver&s;ified, the &s;pecial times and &s;ea|&s;ons, for accompli&s;hing the benevolent purpo&s;es of GOD, re&s;pecting his eternal felicity. Man, both in his individual and &s;ocial capacity, is the crea|ture of mutation and vici&s;&s;itude; and his &s;tate here below, is ever more or le&s;s checkered with pro&s;|perous and adver&s;e occurrences. The &s;ea&s;ons of rejoicing, and the &s;ea&s;ons of mourning are oft re|turning, with their appropriate le&s;&s;ons of moral in&s;truction. Now he is &s;urrounded with objects, and in&s;pired with &s;en&s;ations, of plea&s;ure and de|light;
<PB N="6" REF="037028_0004_100C8A17349AF6F8">
his horizon is gilded with happifying pro&s;|pects; and he is excited to give &s;cope to the feelings of grateful, innocent, &s;ocial joy. But there is not le&s;s a time to be &s;ad, than a time to rejoice. Anon, the charm is di&s;&s;olved; the vi&s;ionary phan|toms of momentary happine&s;s are fled; and the heart is arre&s;ted, in the career of plea&s;ure, to at|tend to more intere&s;ting &s;cenes. The wandering and thoughtle&s;s mind is &s;ummoned, by the &s;ober, monitory voice of misfortune, to the more cha&s;ten|ed engagements of moral di&s;cipline, &s;elf-in&s;pection, and religious improvement. To this unexpected fatality of events&mdash;this affecting rever&s;e of condi|tion, communities, like individuals, are ever &s;ub|ject. They too, have their times of depre&s;&s;ion, as well as elevation&mdash;their &s;ea&s;ons of &s;adne&s;s, as well as rejoicing: and mo&s;t kindly does the great Gov|ernor contemplate, in <HI>their</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation, &s;ome be|nevolent ends of his moral government.</P>
<P>LET us then improve the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, in connection with that di&s;tre&s;&s;ing event, in which it has taken birth, to the purpo&s;e of imbuing our minds with &s;ome &s;alutary and u&s;eful in&s;truction. It is an occa&s;ion &s;ingular and novel, in the annals of our country, as it is intere&s;ting to the pre&s;ent ge|neration.
<PB N="7" REF="037028_0005_100C8A18C9F4FB10">
The death of a man like one of us, has whelmed our country in the gloom of mourning, A man, like Jo&s;hua of old, has been rai&s;ed up, from among his brethren, who&s;e important &s;ervices, pre|eminent virtues, and high excellence of character, have &s;o endeared him with the hearts of his coun|trymen, that his death has cau&s;ed every de&s;cription of per&s;ons to unite in te&s;timonials of deepe&s;t regret. The enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;orrow has, on this occa&s;ion, been indulged; and the tears of America have flowed, in copious effu&s;ion, over the tomb of her departed WASHINGTON. "From Georgia to Maine, and from the &s;kirts of the ocean to the habitations of the wilderne&s;s," the accents of grief have dwelt on every tongue; the gloom of de&s;pondency has &s;at on every brow. Eloquence has lavi&s;hed all her &s;tores, and put forth all her energies! Di&s;tricts and corporations have met together, with the badges of mourning and the in&s;ignia of wo, to mingle their condolences, to recount his virtues, to com|memorate his achievements and to blazon his fame. But it is now time that the tide of grief&mdash; the enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;orrow, &s;hould have &s;ub&s;ided. It is now time that rea&s;on and the moral feelings &s;hould re&s;ume their wonted calm, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate tone. With a de&s;ire therefore to meet the inten|tion
<PB N="8" REF="037028_0006_100C8A1B16C091D8">
of our political fathers, in the appointment of this commemoration, let us turn our regards to &s;uch obvious and intere&s;ting truths, as the occa&s;ion is calculated to &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>IT &s;ugge&s;ts, in the fir&s;t place, the real con|nection of eminent &s;uperlative worth, with honor|able fame. Before us, is pre&s;ented a &s;ignal evi|dence, depraved and degenerate as the human kind are, of the power of merit and real goodne&s;s, to command e&s;teem, veneration and love. However brilliancy of talents may be envied and maligned; however temporary u&s;efulne&s;s, prompted by tem|porary good intention, may be mi&s;con&s;trued or neglected; yet uniform inflexible integrity, inde|fatigable virtue, and per&s;evering di&s;intere&s;ted benefi|cence, will meet approbation and be crowned with honor. It is the appropriate privilege of &s;uch a character, to ri&s;e above envy, malice and faction. On &s;uch a character the cla&s;hing of cabals will often reflect additional lu&s;tre; the anathemas of di&s;appointed partizans will in due time, be changed to congratulatory prai&s;es; the labyrinth of error and mi&s;repre&s;entation, as he proceeds in the &s;trait cour&s;e of benevolent exertion, will gradually un|ravel; and when he fini&s;hes his part and makes
<PB N="9" REF="037028_0007_100C8A1D52EB0868">
his exit, envy will die; and the full bur&s;t of ap|plau&s;e will break forth, to con&s;ecrate his memory and perpetuate his fame.</P>
<P>AGAIN we are led, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to analyze the individual attributes of an illu&s;trious character; and to con&s;ider, in what its grandeur preci&s;ely con&s;i&s;ts. The virtues, which con&s;titute greatne&s;s, conciliate love, and attract veneration, are fidelity and &s;incerity, mode&s;ty and moderation, con&s;i&s;tency and regularity, humanity and compa&s;|&s;ion. The&s;e virtues informed by wi&s;dom&mdash;in|&s;pired by di&s;intere&s;ted philanthropy and undi&s;&s;em|bled piety, form the excellence of that character, which Americans will ever delight to extol. Courage and cunning&mdash;intrepidity in the field, and penetration in the cabinet, are doubtle&s;s qualities, which he eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. But the&s;e features of his character, are only the rude prominences of that fair piece, which, with infinite profit, we may critically &s;urvey.</P>
<P>TO que&s;tion the heroi&s;m of him, who led our armies to victory and to glory, no one could pre|tend. To deny the merit of profound &s;agacity to him, who conducted our political bark, with &s;o
<PB N="10" REF="037028_0008_100C8A1EE61F8580">
much &s;ucce&s;s, thro' &s;o many dangers, would be equally unju&s;t. Yet the humane and benevolent virtues, in&s;pired by the noble&s;t principles, actuated by the pure&s;t motives, and exerted with mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed fidelity, per&s;everance and utility, are the traits, which have exalted him far above oth|ers, who may have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him in the trade of &s;laughter. Introduced upon the public theatre, at an eventful and important cri&s;is; placed in a &s;itu|ation, which offered &s;cope to patriotic and benevo|lent exertion, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an adventrous mind, and a generous di&s;intere&s;ted heart, he, in every period and department of his public functions, di&s;|played the full lu&s;tre of tho&s;e virtues abovemen|tioned. Incorruptible in his principles, indefatiga|ble in his duties, immoveable in his de&s;igns, and firm and &s;teady to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, he evinced and exemplified that con&s;tancy of virtue and purity of motive, from which nothing could tempt him to &s;werve.</P>
<P>WE are not uncon&s;cious, that the brighte&s;t human characters will ever be &s;haded with much imperfection. We are con&s;cious moreover, that the fictitious repre&s;entation of a <HI>faultle&s;s mon&s;ter,</HI> would be affrontive to rea&s;on, and di&s;gu&s;ting to an
<PB N="11" REF="037028_0009_100C8A2122EB06A0">
enlightened hearer. But if indi&s;criminate, undi|mini&s;hed applau&s;e were due to any one man, we would cheerfully be&s;tow it on our departed bene|factor, father and friend. Let me not be accu&s;ed of ca&s;ting incen&s;e on the altar of an idol if I &s;ay, that he &s;tands forth, the highe&s;t approximation, which &s;tory exhibits, or the annals of our country affords, to that &s;pecies of character, which philo&s;o|phy loves to portray, and the de&s;pots of the world, in vain, would a&s;&s;ume. He has not pre&s;ented an ex|ception to the maxim, that <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> is ever an appen|dage of true greatne&s;s. His mode&s;t, una&s;&s;uming di&s;|po&s;ition and deportment, &s;trikingly appear, in all his official and popular addre&s;&s;es. The diffidence and &s;elf di&s;tru&s;t with which he accepted appointments a&s;&s;igned him, could only be equalled by that hum|ble piety and mode&s;t affability, with which he re|turned the congratulations of &s;ucce&s;s, in the i&s;&s;ue. To him&s;elf he arrogates nothing;&mdash;to that &s;ove|reign providence, which governs the affairs of the world, he a&s;cribes every au&s;picious event.</P>
<P>THE benevolence of his heart con&s;pired with the faculties of his mind, to form a character &s;ub|&s;tantially u&s;eful, not o&s;tentatiou&s;ly great. Of his correctne&s;s, di&s;patch and promptitude in bu&s;ine&s;s;
<PB N="12" REF="037028_0010_100C8A23C51EF960">
his uniformity, decorum and con&s;i&s;tency in every &s;phere of life; his moderation in pro&s;perity, and firmne&s;s and fortitude under misfortune; his cle|mency to the vanqui&s;hed, compa&s;&s;ion to the mi&s;er|able, and humanity towards all men&mdash;of the&s;e things, the whole &s;eries of his public labors are a legible and fair document. The love of his coun|try and the love of mankind, reigned pure in his &s;oul, without any alloy of avarice or ambition. While his mercenary antagoni&s;t fattened on the &s;poils of his country, <HI>he</HI> made a noble &s;acrifice of wealth as well as of ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, and &s;erved his country without any emolument. That <HI>di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s,</HI> which forms the di&s;criminating line between a WASHINGTON, and the proud pretend|ers to unmerited fame, will be &s;ubject of eulogy &s;o long as merit &s;hall be revered. Po&s;terity, in retrac|ing back the current of events, to the memorable epoch of our national birth, with admiration, will contemplate our political Salvator at the clo&s;ing pe|riod of his military toils and dangers&mdash;crowned with conque&s;t, firm in the affections and confidence of his veteran &s;oldiers&mdash;putting off his armor, re&s;ign|ing back his power, and retiring to the &s;ituation of a private citizen. Nor will po&s;terity be uninfor|med, with what greatne&s;s he, at a &s;ub&s;equent pe|riod,
<PB N="13" REF="037028_0011_100C8A2604AD24C0">
repelled the a&s;&s;aults of the demon of ambi|tion. By a powerful tho' corrupt combination, importuned, to place him&s;elf at the head of his country, and a&s;&s;ume the title and the powers of royalty, he declared his re&s;olution to expatriate him&s;elf, rather than do an act, which would de|grade him to a level with a Cromwell or a Ce&s;ar&mdash; Proofs palpable and convincive of that pure, di&s;in|tere&s;ted philanthropy, which in&s;pired and actuated all his exertions! To this &s;ource, and not to a blind, mi&s;guided, local attachment, we are to refer the many &s;acrifices he made for the good of his country; the various expedients he adopted, to render him&s;elf u&s;eful; the various forms under which he took occa&s;ion to exemplify goodne&s;s; that ardent activity which filled his days; and that univer&s;ality of character under which we recognize him. Hence that con&s;i&s;tency, uniformity and cor|rectne&s;s throughout; that harmony of principle with practice, of motive with duty, of private with public life, which can never be pre&s;erved by the intere&s;ted, the &s;ordid or the in&s;incere. And &s;hall not that unexampled accumulation of honor and public e&s;teem, thus acquired, form a new bond of attachment with <HI>us,</HI> to the &s;ame principle and the &s;ame conduct? Are you charmed with the augu&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="037028_0012_100C8A2793993640">
and lovely image of &s;o much benevolence, &s;o nobly exerted? If &s;o, then cultivate the &s;ame divine &s;pir|it. Does thy bo&s;om bound with hone&s;t ardor, to merit the prai&s;es which are be&s;towed on this orna|ment of our country? Then emulate his virtues, and copy his example. Think not, that his merit and this con&s;equent renown, is the exclu&s;ive privi|lege even of the be&s;t man; for no man is privileg|ed with &s;uch a monopoly. The qualities and the virtues, which have con&s;ecrated his memory, we have &s;een, were &s;uch as <HI>we</HI> may po&s;&s;e&s;s. Though we cannot all move in his elevated &s;phere&mdash;be fir&s;t in council and fir&s;t in the field; yet it may be in the power of every one, to be &s;econd to none in fidelity and &s;incerity, hone&s;ty and regularity, mode&s;ty and humility, humanity and compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>FINALLY, we have pre&s;ented in view a &s;hining example, of the union of moral goodne&s;s with genuine piety; and of that &s;table ba&s;is, which religion affords, of all that is excellent in human conduct. Too often have the pretenders to greatne&s;s been a&s;hamed of religion. Religion they have con&s;idered as fit only to awe the &s;tupid and the vile. They have regarded it as a yoke, under which the wi&s;e, the mighty, and the noble of this
<PB N="15" REF="037028_0013_100C8A2960FF1138">
world ought not to &s;ubmit their necks. But the man, to who&s;e greatne&s;s we reluctantly acknow|ledge a parallel, was not &s;o far exalted above him&s;elf, as to overlook the importance of vital pie|ty. He re&s;pected it, as the bond of &s;ocial order and union, and the grand &s;upport of the duties of men and citizens. He cheri&s;hed it, as the only anchor of &s;afety, amid&s;t the changes and mi&s;eries of this uncertain &s;tate. And we have ju&s;t rea&s;on to believe that in the la&s;t dire exigency of nature, he buoyed up his &s;pirits with its divine con&s;olations. He had not become a pro&s;elyte to that mi&s;erable philo&s;o|phy, which is blind to the clear evidence of divine revelation: he was not a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. To the wi&s;e in&s;titutes and &s;acred rituals of chri&s;tianity, he paid the mo&s;t &s;crupulous attention. He regarded with due deference, the holy &s;abbath. And he was con&s;tant, on that day, in the wor&s;hip of God, in his church.&mdash;But the plea&s;ure, with which I make mention of this la&s;t article, is mingled with a &s;en&s;ation of deep regret. Shall I believe my&s;elf &s;tanding on chri&s;tian ground, that I &s;hould exhibit this humble trait, as appreciating the worth of an illu&s;trious character? When I reflect on the prevailing indifference to every thing &s;acred, in this corner of our country, can hardly believe my&s;elf
<PB N="16" REF="037028_0014_100C8A2B15F66BD8">
&s;urrounded, at this moment, with a &s;ufficient num|ber of the friends of Je&s;us, to &s;hield me from oblo|quy, &s;hould I enlarge on this topic. Blu&s;h, O my fellow &s;inner! Will you believe, that <HI>you</HI> have le&s;s rea&s;on to bow down before GOD, and to a&s;k his protection, than the greate&s;t and be&s;t of men?</P>
<P>IN this &s;ober, monitory &s;ea&s;on, we are loudly admoni&s;hed by the impre&s;&s;ion of the occa&s;ion, to look to our moral &s;tate; to trace out our defections, lap&s;es and crimes, and form re&s;olutions of in&s;tant amendment. While &s;ighing under the pre&s;&s;ure of a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing public calamity, it becomes us with all humility, to review our moral character and conduct, as a people; diligently to &s;earch out the plague of our own heart; and &s;eriou&s;ly to examine the cau&s;es, by which we are incurring the frown of an offended Deity. In this examination, &s;hall we not deplore and lament that &s;peculative and practical infidelity, which too much character|izes the pre&s;ent generation,&mdash;that dereliction of &s;ound principle both moral and religious; that contemptuous neglect of the truths and ordinances of our holy religion; that decay of the &s;ocial and patriotic virtues; that de&s;titution of benevolence; and that virulent, uncandid reciprocation of abu&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="037028_0015_100C8A2DAEB11C18">
and calumny, which has taken ri&s;e and gained frequency, in our political controver&s;ies? And now that we are &s;urveying with con&s;ternation, a mo&s;t melancholy cha&s;m, in our &s;y&s;tem of national defence; &s;hall we not unitedly re&s;olve to renounce our corrupting and demoralizing habits; and ex|ert our combined endeavors, to check that nation|al degeneracy, which is threatening to de&s;troy us? Convinced of the folly as well as guilt, of vainly relying on the &s;trength of man&mdash;convinced of the high importance of rendering propitious the great Governor of the world; and taught in his holy word, and in the uniform experience of all na|tions, that <HI>they</HI> only are happy, who have the Lord for their GOD; let us re&s;olve, by repentance, to for&s;ake our &s;ins, and to walk in future, in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s before him, all the days of our lives. Reverencing, adoring, and obeying the GOD of our fathers; let us obey from the heart, the go&s;pel of his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and religiou&s;ly ob&s;erve its divine in&s;titutions. Denying ungodli|ne&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, let us live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in this world, the fa&s;hion of which is pa&s;&s;ing away. Then &s;hall we be a peculiar people to the Lord our GOD. GOD, even our own GOD, &s;hall then give us his ble&s;&s;ing. Our
<PB N="18" REF="037028_0016_100C8A3021251F68">
righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall then go before us. Our light and our health &s;hall break forth, as the morning, and the glory of the Lord &s;hall be our rereward.</P>
