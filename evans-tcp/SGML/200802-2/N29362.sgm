<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>IT was a &s;atyrical an&s;wer, and deeply reproachful to mankind, which the philo&s;o|pher gave to that que&s;tion,</HI> What &s;oone&s;t grows old? <HI>Replied,</HI> Thanks. <HI>The reproach of it would not be &s;o &s;en&s;ible, were there not &s;en&s;ible demon&s;trations of the truth of it, in tho&s;e that wear the character of the ingenious.

<P><HI>It would be unaccountable &s;tupidity in me, not to maintain the mo&s;t lively, and awful &s;en&s;e of divine rebukes, which the holy GOD has &s;een meet in &s;pot|le&s;s &s;overeignty to di&s;pen&s;e to me, my family and people, in delivering us into the hands of them that hated us; who led us into a &s;trange land:</HI> My &s;oul hath the&s;e &s;till in remembrance, and is humbled in me: <HI>However, GOD has given us plentiful <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

<HEAD>THE REDEEMED CAPTIVE RETURNING TO ZION.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;tory I am going to write, proves, That days of <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> and <HI>prayer,</HI> without reformation, will not avail, to turn away the anger of GOD from a profe&s;&s;ing people; and yet witne&s;&s;eth how very advantageous gracious &s;upplications are, to prepare particular chri&s;tians patient|ly to &s;uffer the will of GOD, in very trying public calamities. For &s;ome of us moved with fear, &s;et apart a day of <HI>prayer,</HI> to a&s;k of GOD either to &s;pare, and &s;ave us from the hands of our enemies, or to prepare us to &s;anctify and honor him, in what way &s;oever he &s;hould come forth towards us. The places of &s;cripture from whence we were entertained in the forenoon, were <HI>Gen.</HI> xxxii. 10, 11: <HI>I am not worthy of the lea&s;t of all the mercies, and of all the truth which thou ha&s;t &s;hewed unto thy &s;ervant:&mdash;
<PB N="8" REF="039104_0006_1013C20C0E0441C0">
Deliver me, I pray thee, front the hand of my brother, from the hand of E&s;au; for I fear him, le&s;t he will come and &s;mite me, and the mother with the children.</HI> And in the afternoon, <HI>Gen.</HI> xxxii. 26, <HI>And he &s;aid, Let me go, for the day breaketh: And he &s;aid, I will not let thee go, except thou ble&s;s me. </HI>&mdash;From which we were called upon to &s;pread the cau&s;es of fear, relating to our own &s;elves, or families before GOD; as al&s;o how it becomes us with an undeniable importunity to be following GOD, with earne&s;t prayers for his ble&s;&s;ing, in every condition. And it is very ob&s;ervable, how GOD ordered our prayers in a pecu|liar manner, to be going up to him; to prepare us with a right <HI>chri&s;tian &s;pirit,</HI> to undergo, and endure &s;uffering trials.</P>
<P>Not long after, the holy and righteous&punc; GOD brought us under great trials, as to our per&s;ons and families, which put us un|der a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;preading before him in a wilderne&s;s, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing dangers and calamities of our relations, yea, that call|ed on us notwith&s;tanding &s;eeming pre&s;ent frowns, to re&s;olve by his grace, not to be &s;ent away without a ble&s;&s;ing. <HI>Jacob</HI> in wre&s;tling has the hollow of his thigh put out of joint, and it is &s;aid to him, <HI>Let me
<PB N="9" REF="039104_0007_1013C20A7257AA30">
go:</HI> Yet he is rather animated to a heroi|cal chri&s;tian re&s;olution to continue earne&s;t for the ble&s;&s;ing, than di&s;couraged from a&s;king.</P>
<P>ON <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 29<HI>th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> 1703-4, not long before break of day, the enemy came in like a flood upon us; our watch being unfaithful: An evil, the aw|ful effects of which, in the &s;urpri&s;al of our fort, &s;hould be&s;peak all watchmen to avoid, as they would not bring the charge of blood upon them&s;elves. They came to my hou&s;e in the beginning of the on&s;et, and by their violent endeavours to break open doors and windows, with <HI>axes</HI> and <HI>hatchets,</HI> awaked me out of &s;leep; on which I leaped out of bed, and running towards the door, perceived the enemy making their entrance into the hou&s;e; I called to awaken two &s;oldiers in the cham|ber, and returning toward my bed-&s;ide for my arm, the enemy immediately broke into the room, I judge, to the number of twenty, with <HI>painted faces,</HI> and hideous ac|clamations. I reached up my hands to the bed te&s;ter for my pi&s;tol, uttering a &s;hort petition to GOD, <HI>for everla&s;ting mer|cies for me and mine, on the account of the
<PB N="10" REF="039104_0008_1013C2161323A880">
merits of our glorified Redeemer;</HI> expecting a pre&s;ent pa&s;&s;age through the velley of the &s;hadow of death; &s;aving in my&s;elf, as <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> xxxviii. 10, 11. <HI>I &s;aid, in the cutting off my days, I &s;hall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the re&s;idue of my years. I &s;aid, I &s;hall not &s;ee the Lord, even the Lord, in the land of the living; I &s;hall behold man no more, with the inhabitants of the world.</HI> Taking down my pi&s;tol, I cocked it, and put it to the brea&s;t of the fir&s;t Indian that came up; but my pi&s;tol mi&s;&s;ing fire, I was &s;eized by three Indians, who di&s;armed me, and bound me naked, as I was in my &s;hirt, and &s;o I &s;tood for near the &s;pace of an hour: Binding me, they told me they would carry me to <HI>Que|beck.</HI> My Pi&s;tol mi&s;&s;ing fire, was an oc|ca&s;ion of my life's being pre&s;erved; &s;ince which I have al&s;o found it profitable to be cro&s;&s;ed in my own will. The judgment of GOD did not long &s;lumber again&s;t one of the three which took me, who was a captain, for by &s;un ri&s;ing he received a mortal &s;hot from my next neighbor's hou&s;e; who oppo&s;ed &s;o great a number of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> as <HI>three hundred,</HI> and yet were no more than <HI>&s;even</HI> men in an ungarri&s;oned hou&s;e.</P>

I cannot relate the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing care I had for my dear wife, who had lain in but a few weeks before; and for my poor chil|dren, family, and chri&s;tian neighbours. The enemy fell to rifling the hou&s;e, and entered in great numbers into every room of the hou&s;e. I begged of GOD, to re|member mercy in the mid&s;t of judgment, That he would &s;o far re&s;train their wrath, as to prevent their murdering of us: That we might have <HI>grace to glorify his name, whether in life or death;</HI> and as I was able, committed our &s;tate to GOD. The ene|mies who entered the hou&s;e, were all of them <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Macquas,</HI> in&s;ulted over me awhile, holding up hatchets over my head, threatening to burn all I had; but yet GOD beyond expectation, made us in a great mea&s;ure to be pitied; for tho' &s;ome were &s;o cruel and barbarous as to take and carry to the door, two of my children and murder them, as al&s;o a negro woman; yet they gave me liberty to put on my clothes, keeping me bound with a cord on one arm, till I put on my clothes to the other; and then changing my cord, they let me dre&s;s my&s;elf, and then pinioned me again. Gave liberty to my dear wife to dre&s;s her&s;elf, and our children. About

&s;un an hour high, we were all carried out of the hou&s;e, for a march, and &s;aw many of the hou&s;es of my neighbors in flames, perceiving the whole fort, one hou&s;e ex|cepted, to be taken. Who can tell what &s;orrows pierced our &s;ouls, when we &s;aw our&s;elves carried away from GOD'S &s;anctu|ary, to go into a &s;trange land, expo&s;ed to &s;o many trials; the journey being at lea&s;t <HI>three hundred miles</HI> we were to travel; the &s;now up to the knees, and we never inur|ed to &s;uch hard&s;hips and fatigues; the place we were to be carried to, a Popi&s;h country. Upon my parting from the town, they fired my hou&s;e and barn. We were carried over the river, to the foot of the <HI>mountain,</HI> about a mile from my hou&s;e, where we found a great number of our chri&s;tian neighbors, men, women, and children, to the number of an <HI>hundred, nineteen</HI> of which were afterward murder|ed by the way, and <HI>two</HI> &s;tarved to death, near <HI>Cowa&s;s,</HI> in a time of great &s;carcity or famine, the &s;avages underwent there. When we came to the foot of the moun|tain, they took away our &s;hoes, and gave us in the room of them, Indian &s;hoes, to prepare us for our travel. Whil&s;t we were there, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> beat out a company
<PB N="13" REF="039104_0011_1013C2237B97DFE8">
that remained in the town, and pur&s;u|ed them to the river, killing and wound|ing many of them; but the body of the army being alarmed, they repul&s;ed tho&s;e few <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that pur&s;ued them.</P>
<P>I am not able to give you an account of the number of the enemy, &s;lain, but I ob&s;erved after this fight, no great in&s;ulting mirth, as I expected; and &s;aw many wounded per&s;ons, and for &s;everal days to|gether, they buried of their party, and one of chief note among the <HI>Macquas.</HI> The governor of <HI>Canada</HI> told me, his army had that &s;ucce&s;s with the lo&s;s of but <HI>eleven</HI> men; <HI>three Frenchmen,</HI> one of which was the <HI>lieutenant</HI> of the army, <HI>five Macquas</HI> and <HI>three Indians:</HI> But after my arrival at <HI>Quebeck,</HI> I &s;pake with an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who was taken in the la&s;t war, and marri|ed there, and of their religion; who told me, they lo&s;t <HI>above forty,</HI> and that many were wounded: I replied, the governor of <HI>Canada</HI> &s;aid, they lo&s;t but <HI>eleven</HI> men: He an&s;wered, 'tis true, that there were but <HI>eleven</HI> killed outright at the taking of the fort, but that many others were wounded, among whom was the <HI>en&s;ign</HI> of the <HI>French;</HI> but &s;aid he, they had a &s;ight in the mead|ow, and that in both engagements, they

lo&s;t <HI>more than forty.</HI> Some of the &s;oldiers, both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> then pre&s;ent, told me &s;o, (&s;aid he,) adding, that the <HI>French</HI> always endeavour to conceal the number of their &s;lain.</P>
<P>After this, we went up the mountain, and &s;aw the &s;moke of the fires in the town, and beheld the awful de&s;olations of Deer|field: And before we marched any far|ther, they killed a &s;ucking child of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> There were &s;lain by the enemy of the inhabitants of Deerfield, to the number of <HI>thirty eight,</HI> be&s;ides <HI>nine</HI> of the neighboring towns. We travelled not far the <HI>fir&s;t day;</HI> God made the heathen &s;o to pity our children, that though they had &s;everal wounded per&s;ons of their own to carry upon their &s;houlders, for <HI>thirty miles,</HI> before they came to the river, yet they carried our children, incapable of travel|ling, in their arms, and upon their &s;houlders. When we came to our lodg|ing place, the <HI>fir&s;t night,</HI> they dug away the &s;now, and made &s;ome wigwams, cut down &s;ome &s;mall branches of the <HI>&s;pruce tree</HI> to lie down on, and gave the pri&s;oners &s;ome|what to eat; but we had but little appe|tite. I was pinioned, and bound down that night, and &s;o I was every night whil&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="039104_0013_1013C22C2FA9EF50">
I was with the army. Some of the ene|my who brought drink with them from the town, fell to drinking, and in their drunken fit, they killed my negro man, the only dead per&s;on I either &s;aw at the town, or in the way.</P>
<P>In the night an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> made his e&s;|cape; in the morning [<HI>March</HI> I,] I was called for, and ordered by the general to tell the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that if any more made their e&s;cape, they would burn the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners. He that took me, was un|willing to let me &s;peak with any of the pri&s;oners, as we marched; but on the <HI>morning</HI> of the <HI>&s;econd day,</HI> he being ap|pointed to guard the rear, I was put into the hands of my other ma&s;ter, who per|mitted me to &s;peak to my wife, when I overtook her, and to walk with her to help her in her journey. On the way, we di&s;cour&s;ed of the happine&s;s of tho&s;e who had a right to <HI>an hou&s;e not made with bands, eternal in the heavens;</HI> and <HI>God for a father, and friend;</HI> as al&s;o, that it was our rea&s;onable duty, quietly to &s;ubmit to the will of GOD, and to &s;ay, <HI>the will of the Lord be done.</HI> My wife told me her &s;trength of body began to fail, and that I mu&s;t expect to part with her; &s;aying, &s;he

hoped God would pre&s;erve my life, and the life of &s;ome, if not of all our children, with us; and commended to me, under God, the care of them. She never &s;pake any di&s;contented word as to what had be|fallen us, but with &s;uitable expre&s;&s;ions ju&s;|tified God in what had happened. We &s;oon made a halt, in which time my chief &s;urviving ma&s;ter came up, upon which I was put upon marching with the foremo&s;t, and &s;o made to take my la&s;t farewell of my dear wife, <HI>the de&s;ire of my eyes,</HI> and companion in many mercies and afflic|tions. Upon our &s;eparation from each other, we a&s;ked for each other, grace &s;uf|ficient, for what God &s;hould call us to: After our being parted from one another, &s;he &s;pent the few remaining minutes of her &s;tay, in reading the holy &s;criptures; which &s;he was wont per&s;onally every day to delight her &s;oul in reading, praying, meditating on, and over, by her&s;elf, in her clo&s;et, over and above what &s;he heard out of them in our family wor&s;hip. I was made to wade over a &s;mall river, and &s;o were all the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the water above knee deep, the &s;tream very &s;wift; and after that to travel up a &s;mall mountain; my &s;trength was almo&s;t &s;pent, before I
<PB N="17" REF="039104_0015_1013C2334CC800D0">
came to the top of it: No &s;ooner had I overcome the difficulty of that a&s;cent, but I was permitted to &s;it down, and be un|burthened of my pack; I &s;at pitying tho&s;e who were behind, and intreated my ma&s;|ter to let me go down and help my wife; but he refu&s;ed and would not let me &s;tir from him. I a&s;ked each of the pri&s;oners (as they pa&s;&s;ed by me) after her, and heard that pa&s;&s;ing through the above&s;aid river, &s;he fell down, and was plunged over head and ears in the water; after which &s;he travelled not far, for at the foot of that mountain, the cruel and bloodthir&s;ty &s;av|age who took her, &s;lew her with his hatch|et at one &s;troke, the tidings of which were very awful: And yet &s;uch was the hard-heartedne&s;s of the adver&s;ary, that my tears were reckoned to me as a reproach. My lo&s;s, and the lo&s;s of my children was great, our hearts were &s;o filled with &s;orrow, that nothing but the comfortable hopes of her being taken away in mercy, to her&s;elf, from the evils we were to &s;ee, feel, and &s;uffer under, (and joined to the a&s;&s;embly of the <HI>&s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect,</HI> to re&s;t in peace, and <HI>joy un&s;peakable and full of glory;</HI> and the good plea&s;ure of God thus to exerci&s;e us) could have kept us

<P>We were again called upon to march, with a far heavier <HI>burden on my &s;pirits,</HI> than on my <HI>back.</HI> I begged of God to over|rule in his providence, that the corp&s;e of one &s;o dear to me, and of one who&s;e &s;pirit he had taken to dwell with him in glory, might meet with a chri&s;tian burial, and not be left for meat to the fowls of the air, and bea&s;ts of the earth: A mercy that God graciou&s;ly vouch&s;afed to grant. For God put it into the hearts of my neigh|bors, to come out as far as &s;he lay, to take up her corp&s;e, carry it to the town, and decently to bury it &s;oon after. In our march they killed a &s;ucking infant of one of my neighbors; and before night a <HI>girl</HI> of about <HI>eleven</HI> years of age.

<P>In the <HI>morning [March 2.]</HI> we were all called before the chief <HI>Sachems</HI> of the <HI>Mac|quas</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> that a more equal di&s;|tribution might be made of the pri&s;oners, among them: At my going from the <HI>wigwam,</HI> my be&s;t cloathing was taken from me.

<P>In our <HI>fourth day's march, [Friday, March</HI> 3,] the enemy killed another of my neighbors, who being near the time of travail, was wearied with her journey.

of the Savages. My change of diet, after the difficulties of my Journeys, cau&s;ed an alteration in my body: I was <HI>phy&s;icked,</HI> and <HI>blooded,</HI> and very tenderly taken care of in my &s;ickne&s;s. The governor re|deemed <HI>my elde&s;t daughter</HI> out of the hands of the <HI>Indians;</HI> and &s;he was carefully tend|ed in the <HI>ho&s;pital,</HI> until &s;he was well of her lamene&s;s; and by the governor pro|vided for re&s;pectfully, during her &s;tay in the country. <HI>My younge&s;t child</HI> was re|deemed by a gentlewoman in the city, as the <HI>Indians</HI> pa&s;&s;ed by. After the <HI>Indians</HI> had been at their fort, and di&s;cour&s;ed with the prie&s;ts, they came back and offered to the gentlewoman a man for the child, al|ledging that the child could not be prof|itable to her, but the man would, for he was a weaver, and his &s;ervice would much advance the de&s;ign &s;he had of mak|ing cloth: But GOD overruled &s;o far, that this temptation to the woman pre|vailed not for an exchange; for had the child gone to the <HI>Indian</HI> fort, in an ordi|nary way it had abode there &s;till, as the re&s;t of the children carried there do. The governor gave orders to certain officers to get the <HI>re&s;t of my children</HI> out of the hands of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and as many of my neigh|bors

as they could. After &s;ix weeks, a merchant of the city obtained my elde&s;t &s;on, that was taken, to live with him: He took a great deal of pains to per&s;uade the &s;avages to part with him. An <HI>Indian</HI> came to the city (Sagamore <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Pennacook</HI>) from <HI>Cowa&s;s,</HI> and brought word of my &s;on <HI>Stephens'</HI> being near that place; &s;ome money was put into his hand for his redemption, and a promi&s;e of full &s;atisfaction if he brought him; but the <HI>Indian</HI> proved unfaithful, and I never &s;aw <HI>my child</HI> till a year after.</P>
<P>The governor ordered a <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> to go along with me to &s;ee <HI>my younge&s;t daughter</HI> among the <HI>Macquas,</HI> and endeavor for her ran&s;om. I went with him; he was very courteous to me, and from his pari&s;h which was near the <HI>Macqua</HI> fort, he wrote a letter to the <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> to de&s;ire him to &s;end <HI>my child</HI> to &s;ee me, and to &s;peak with them that took her, to come along with it. But the <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> wrote back a letter, <HI>that I &s;hould not be permitted to &s;peak with, or &s;ee my child, and if I came my labor would be lo&s;t; and that the</HI> Macquas <HI>would as &s;oon part with their hearts, as my child.</HI> At my return to the city, I with an heavy heart carried the <HI>Je&s;uit's</HI> letter to the gov|ernor,
<PB N="45" REF="039104_0043_1013C2CF41FCAAC0">
who when he read it, was very angry, and endeavored to comfort me, a&s;&s;uring me <HI>I &s;hould &s;ee it, and &s;peak with it;</HI> and he would to his utmo&s;t endeavor for it's ran&s;om: Accordingly he &s;ent to the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> who were in the city, and bid them improve their intere&s;t for the obtain|ing the child.

one word of them, I hope it wont do me any harm.</HI> I told her &s;he mu&s;t be care|ful &s;he did not forget her <HI>catechi&s;m,</HI> and the <HI>&s;criptures</HI> &s;he had learnt by heart.

I &s;aw her once a few days after in the city, but' had not many minutes of time with her, but what time I had improved to give her the be&s;t advice I could. The governor laboured much for her redemp|tion, at la&s;t he had the promi&s;e of it, in ca&s;e he would procure for them, an <HI>Indian</HI> girl in her &s;tead. Accordingly he <HI>&s;ent</HI> up the river &s;ome hundred of leagues for one, and when offered by the governor it was refu&s;ed: He offered them an hundred pieces of eight for her redemption, but it was refu&s;ed.

<P>When I had di&s;cour&s;ed with the child, and was coming out of the fort, one of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> went out of the chamber with me, and &s;ome &s;oldiers to convey me to the <HI>canoe.</HI> I &s;aw &s;ome of my poor neighbors, who &s;tood with longing expectations to &s;ee me, and &s;peak with me, and had leave from their &s;avage ma&s;ters &s;o to do. I was by the <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> him&s;elf thru&s;t along by force, and permitted only to tell them &s;ome of their relations they a&s;ked after, were well in the city, and that with a very audable voice; being not permitted to come near to them.</P>
<P>After my return to the city, I was very melancholy, for I could not be permitted &s;o much as to pray with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who dwelt in the &s;ame hou&s;e.

I &s;pake to the governor that no forcible means might be u&s;ed with any of the captives re&s;pect|ing their religion; he told me he allowed no &s;uch thing. I am per&s;uaded that the governor, if he might act for him&s;elf, would not have &s;uffered &s;uch things to be done as have been done, and that he never did know of &s;everal things acted a|gain&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>

<P>After coming down to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> I was invited to dine with the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> and to my face they were civil enough. But af|ter a few days, a young gentleman came to my chamber, and told me, that one of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> (after we had done dinner) made a few <HI>di&s;tricks</HI> of ver&s;es, and gave them to his &s;cholars to tran&s;late into <HI>French:</HI> He &s;hewed them to me.

the &s;ame time, the bi&s;hop of <HI>Canada</HI> with twenty eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, were taken by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as they were coming from <HI>France,</HI> and carried into <HI>England</HI> as pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>One &s;abbath day morning I ob&s;erved many &s;igns of approaching rain, a great moi&s;ture on the &s;tones of the hearth and chimney jams.

<P>Not many days after, and a few days before governor <HI>de'Voudrel's</HI> coming down, I was &s;ent away fifteen miles down the river, that I might not have an opportu|nity of conver&s;ation with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I was courteou&s;ly treated by the <HI>French,</HI> and the <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> of that pari&s;h; they told me, he was one of the mo&s;t learned men in the country; he was a very ingenious man, zealous in their way, but yet very familiar.

<P>I am per&s;uaded that the <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> of that pari&s;h where I kept, abhorred their &s;end|ing down the heathen to commit out|rages again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> &s;aying, It was more like committing murders, than managing a war.

that our friends in <HI>New-England,</HI> might have grace to make a more thankful and faithful improvement of the means of grace, than we had done; who by our neglects, find our&s;elves out of GOD'S &s;anctuary.</P>
<P>On the <HI>twenty fir&s;t</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> 1704, I received &s;ome letters from <HI>New-England,</HI> with an account that many of our neigh|bors e&s;caped out of the de&s;olations in the fort; and that my dear wife was decently buried; And that my elde&s;t &s;on who was ab&s;ent in our de&s;olation, was &s;ent to col|lege, and provided for; which occa&s;ion|ed thank&s;giving to GOD in the mid&s;t of afflictions, and cau&s;ed prayers even in <HI>Can|ada,</HI> to be going daily up to heaven for a ble&s;&s;ing on benefactors, &s;howing &s;uch kindne&s;s to the de&s;olate and afflicted.</P>

A young woman of our town met with a
<PB N="65" REF="039104_0063_1013C2EED837B500">
new trial: For one day a <HI>Frenchman</HI> came into the room where &s;he was, and &s;hewed her his beads, and boa&s;ted of them, putting them near to her; &s;he knocked them out of his hands on the floor; for which &s;he was beaten and threatened with death, and for &s;ome days impri&s;oned. I pleaded with God his overruling this fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay for the deliver|ance of &s;ome, as a pledge of the re&s;t be|ing delivered in due time. I implored Capt. <HI>de Beauville</HI> who had always been very friendly, to intercede with the gov|ernor for the return of my elde&s;t daugh|ter; and for his purcha&s;ing my &s;on <HI>Ste|phen,</HI> from the <HI>Indians</HI> at St. <HI>Francois</HI> fort; and for liberty to go up and &s;ee my chil|dren and neighbors at <HI>Montreal.</HI> Divine providence appeared to the moderating my afflictions, in that five <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> per&s;ons of our town were permitted to return with Capt. <HI>Living&s;ton,</HI> among whom went my elde&s;t daughter. And my &s;on <HI>Stephen</HI> was redeemed and &s;ent to live with me: He was almo&s;t quite naked, and very poor; he had &s;uffered much among the <HI>Indians.</HI> One of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> took upon him, to come to the wigwam, and whip

him, on &s;ome complaints that the <HI>Squaws</HI> had made, that he did not work enough for them. As to my petition for going up to <HI>Montreal,</HI> to &s;ee my children and neighbors, it was denied; as my former de&s;ire of coming up to the city before Capt. <HI>Living&s;ton'</HI>s coming, was. GOD granted me favor as to two of my peti|tions; but yet brought me by his grace to be willing, that he &s;hould glorify him|&s;elf in di&s;po&s;ing of me and mine as he plea&s;|ed, and knew to be mo&s;t for his glory. And almo&s;t always before any remarka|ble favor, I was brought to lie down at the foot of GOD, and made to be willing that GOD &s;hould govern the world, &s;o as might be mo&s;t for his own honor, and brought to re&s;ign all to his holy &s;overeign|ty. A frame of &s;pirit when wrought in me by the Grace of GOD, giving the great|e&s;t content and &s;atisfaction; and very of|ten a forerunner of the mercy a&s;ked of GOD, or a plain demon&s;tration, that the not obtaining my reque&s;t was be&s;t for me. I had no &s;mall refre&s;hing, in having one of my children with me for four months. And the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were many of them &s;trengthened with hopes, that the treaties

<P>In Augu&s;t, Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> and Capt. <HI>Vetch,</HI> arrived, and great encouragements were given as to an exchange of all, in the &s;pring of the year: and &s;ome few again were &s;ent home; among&s;t whom I ob|tained leave to &s;end my &s;on <HI>Stephen.</HI></P>

<P>Upon Mr. <HI>Dudley'</HI>s and Capt. <HI>Vetch'</HI>s petitioning, I was again permitted to go up to <HI>Quebeck;</HI> but di&s;puting with a mend|icant <HI>Friar,</HI> who &s;aid, "<HI>He was an Eng|li&s;hman &s;ent from</HI> France, <HI>to endeavor the conver&s;ion of the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>at</HI> Quebeck;" who arrived at <HI>Canada</HI> whil&s;t our gentle|men were there: I was by the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> means ordered again to return to <HI>Chateau|viche;</HI> and no other rea&s;on given, but be|cau&s;e I di&s;cour&s;ed with that <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> and their fear I &s;hould prevent his &s;ucce&s;s a|mong the captives.

<P>A little before Mr. <HI>Dudley'</HI>s arrival, came a &s;oldier into my landlord's hou&s;e, barefoot and bareleg'd, going on a pil|grimage to <HI>Saint Anne. For,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>my captain, who died &s;ome years ago, appeared to me, and told me he was in purgatory; and &s;aid I mu&s;t go a pilgrimage to Saint</HI> Anne, <HI>doing penance, and get a</HI> ma&s;s <HI>&s;aid for him, and then he &s;hould be delivered.</HI> And many believed it, and were much affected with it; and came and told me of it, to gain my credit of their devi&s;ed purgatory: The &s;oldier told me the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> had coun|&s;elled him to undertake this pilgrimage, and I am apt to think, ordered his calling in at my landlord's, that I might &s;ee and &s;peak with him. I laughed at the con|ceit, that a &s;oldier mu&s;t be pitched upon to be &s;ent on this errand; but they were
<PB N="69" REF="039104_0067_1013C2F7B3DE9850">
much di&s;plea&s;ed, and lamented my ob&s;ti|nacy, in that I would not be reclaimed from a denial of purgatory, by &s;uch a <HI>mi|raculous providence.</HI></P>
<P>As I was able, I &s;pread the cau&s;e be|fore GOD, be&s;eeching him to di&s;appoint them in their expectations to pro&s;elyte a|ny of the captives by this &s;tratagem; and by the goodne&s;s of GOD, it was not very &s;erviceable: For the &s;oldier's conver&s;ation was &s;uch, that &s;everal among the <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves, judged it to be a forgery. And though the captain &s;poken of, was the governor's lady's brother, I never more heard any concernment or care to get him out of purgatory.</P>
<P>One of the pari&s;h where I lived, told me, That on the twenty &s;econd of July, 1705, he was at Quebeck, at the mendi|cant <HI>Friars</HI> church, on one of their fea&s;t days, in honor of a great &s;aint of their or|der, and that at five o'clock ma&s;s in the morning, near two hundred per&s;ons being pre&s;ent, a great <HI>grey cat</HI> broke or pu&s;hed a|&s;ide &s;ome gla&s;s, entered into the church, and pa&s;&s;ed along near the altar, and put out five or &s;ix candles that were burning; and that no one could tell which way the cat went out: And he thought it was the devil.</P>

<P>When I was in the city in September, I &s;aw two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> maids who had lived with the <HI>Indians</HI> a long time.

<P>The <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> after Mr. <HI>Dudley'</HI>s going from <HI>Canada,</HI> were ready to think their
<PB N="71" REF="039104_0069_1013C2F93804CE18">
time was &s;hort for gaining <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pro&s;e|lytes, and doubled their diligence and wiles, to gain over per&s;ons to their per&s;ua|&s;ion. I improved all opportunities I could, to write to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that in that way I might be &s;erviceable to them. But many or mo&s;t of my letters treating about reli|gion, were intercepted, and burnt. I had a letter &s;ent down to me by order of the governor, that I had liberty of writing to my children and friends, which &s;hould be continued; provided I wrote about indif|ferent things, and &s;aid nothing in them a|bout the points in controver&s;y between them and us: And if I was &s;o hardy as to write letters otherwi&s;e, they &s;hould en|deavor to prevent their being delivered. Accordingly I found many of them were burnt. Sometimes notice would be giv|en to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that they were burnt; &s;o that their writing was &s;omewhat u&s;eful, though never peru&s;ed by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> be|cau&s;e they judged tho&s;e letters condemned <HI>Popery.</HI> Many of our letters written from <HI>New-England</HI> were never delivered, be|cau&s;e of &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions about religion in them. And as I &s;aid before, after Mr. <HI>Dudley'</HI>s departure from <HI>Quebeck,</HI> endeavors were very vigorous to &s;educe. Some
<PB N="72" REF="039104_0070_1013C2A84A768338">
were flattered with large promi&s;es, others were threatened and beaten, becau&s;e they would not turn. And when two Eng|li&s;h, women, who had always oppo&s;ed their religion, were &s;ick in the ho&s;pital, they kept with them night and day, till they died, and their friends were kept from coming to vi&s;it them: After their death, they gave out that they died in the <HI>Rom|i&s;h Faith,</HI> and were received into their <HI>communion.</HI> Before their death ma&s;&s;es were &s;aid for them, and they were buried in the church yard, with all their ceremo|nies. And after this, letters were &s;ent in|to all parts to inform the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that the&s;e two women turned to their religion before their death, and that it concerned them to follow their example; for they could not be more ob&s;tinate than tho&s;e women were in their health, again&s;t the <HI>Romi&s;h Faith,</HI> and yet on a death-bed they embraced it. They told the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who lived near, <HI>That our religion was a dangerous religion to die in.</HI> But I &s;hall hereafter relate the ju&s;t grounds we have to think the&s;e things were fal&s;ehoods.</P>
<P>I was informed, there was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> girl bid to take and wear the cro&s;s, and cro&s;s her&s;elf: She refu&s;ed; they threat|ened
<PB N="73" REF="039104_0071_1013C2FAC209D1F0">
her, and &s;hewed her the Cro&s;s. At length &s;he had her choice, either to cro&s;s her&s;elf, and take the cro&s;s, or be whipt, &s;he cho&s;e to be whipt; and they took up her clothes, and made as tho' they would correct her; but &s;eeing her choo&s;ing in|deed to &s;uffer rather than comply, they de&s;i&s;ted and tied the Cro&s;s about her neck. Some were taken and &s;hut up among the religious, and all &s;orts of means u&s;ed to gain them.</P>
<P>I received a letter from one of my neighbors, wherein he thus bewails: <Q>I obtained leave of my ma&s;ter to go to the <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">qua</HI> fort to &s;ee my children, that I had not &s;een for a long time: I carried a letter from my ma&s;ter, to &s;hew that I had leave to come. When I came to the &s;ort, I heard that one of my children was in the woods. I went to &s;ee a boy I had there, who lived with one of the <HI>Je&s;uits;</HI> I had ju&s;t a&s;ked him of his welfare, he &s;aid his ma&s;ter would come pre&s;ently, he dur&s;t not &s;tay to &s;peak with me now, being in &s;uch awe of his ma&s;ter. On which I withdrew, and when his ma&s;|ter came in, I went and a&s;ked leave of him to &s;peak with my child, and &s;hewed
<PB N="74" REF="039104_0072_1013C2AB96FE2390">
him my letter. But he ab&s;olutely refu&s;|ed to let me &s;ee or &s;peak with him; and &s;aid, I had brought no letter from the governor, and would not permit me to &s;tay in the fort, though I had travelled on foot near fifty miles for no other er|rand than to &s;ee and &s;peak with my chil|dren.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame per&s;on, with another <HI>Engli&s;h|man,</HI> la&s;t &s;pring, obtained leave of the gov|ernor general, to go to the &s;ame fort on the fame errand, and carried letters from the governor to the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> that he might be permitted to &s;peak with his children. The letter was delivered to the <HI>Je&s;uits;</HI> who told him, his &s;on was not at home, but gone a hunting. Whereas he was hid from them, as he heard afterwards, &s;o the poor man lo&s;t his labour a &s;econd time. The&s;e men &s;ay, that when they returned to <HI>Montreal,</HI> one <HI>Laland,</HI> who was appoint|ed as a &s;py, always to ob&s;erve the motions of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> told them, that one of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> had come in before them, and had told the governor that the lad was gone a hunting; and that the <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> who accompanied this poor man, went out in|to the woods in hopes of finding the lad, and &s;aw him, but the lad run away, and
<PB N="75" REF="039104_0073_1013C30417651ED8">
that he followed him and called after him, but he would not &s;top; but holding out a gun, threatened to &s;hoot him down, if he followed him, and &s;o he was di&s;cour|aged, and turned back. And &s;ays LA|LAND, <HI>you will never leave going to &s;ee your children and neighbors, till &s;ome of you are killed.</HI> But the men told him, it was an ab&s;olute lie, let who would report it; for they had neither &s;een the lad, nor did they go into the woods to &s;earch after him. They judge this was told to the governor, to prevent any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for the future go|ing no &s;ee their children and neighbors. Some of ours &s;ay, they have been little better than ab&s;olutely promi&s;ed, to have their children who are among the <HI>Savages,</HI> in ca&s;e they them&s;elves would embrace <HI>Popery.</HI> And that the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> had &s;aid, <HI>They had rather the children &s;hould be among the</HI> Indians, <HI>as they were, than be brought out by the</HI> French, <HI>and &s;o be in a readine&s;s to return for</HI> New-England.</P>
<P>A maid of our town was put into a re|ligious hou&s;e among the <HI>Nuns,</HI> for more than two years, and all &s;orts of means, by flatteries, threatenings and abu&s;ive carriage u&s;ed to bring her to turn. They of|fered her money, which when refu&s;ed, e&s;|pecially
<PB N="76" REF="039104_0074_1013C2B2719E7420">
the latter part of the time, they threatened her very much; &s;ent for her before them, commanded her to <HI>cro&s;s her|&s;elf.</HI> She refu&s;ed, they hit her a box on the ear; bid her again, &s;till &s;he refu&s;ed. They ordered a rod with &s;ix branches full of knots to be brought; and when &s;he refu&s;ed, they &s;truck her on the hands, &s;till renewing their commands; and &s;he &s;tood to her refu&s;als, till her hands were filled with wales, with the blows. But one &s;aid, beat her no more, we will give her to the <HI>Indians,</HI> if &s;he will not turn.

A <HI>Squaw</HI> was brought in and &s;aid, <HI>She was &s;ent in to fetch her to the</HI> INDIANS; but &s;he refu&s;ed; the <HI>Squaw</HI> went away, and &s;aid, <HI>She would bring her hu&s;band with her tomorrow, and &s;he &s;hould be carried a|way by force.</HI> She told me, &s;he remem|bered what I told her one day, after the <HI>Nuns</HI> had threatened to give her away to the <HI>Indians;</HI> that they only &s;aid &s;o to af|fright her, that they never would give her away.

<HI>and that they would afflict her without giving her any re&s;t, if &s;he refu&s;ed:</HI> But GOD pre|&s;erved her from falling. <HI>This poor girl</HI> had many prayers going up to heaven for her, daily, and by name, becau&s;e her tri|als were more known to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> than the trials of others, who lived, more re|mote from them.</P>
<P>Here might be an hi&s;tory by it&s;elf, of the trials and &s;ufferings of many of our children, and young ones, who have been abu&s;ed, and after &s;eparation from grown per&s;ons, made to do as they would have them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here give an account of what was done to one of my children, a boy between fifteen and &s;ixteen years of age, two hundred miles di&s;tant from me, which occa&s;ioned a grief and &s;orrow, that I want words to utter; and yet was kept under &s;uch awe, that he never dur&s;t write any thing to me, for fear of being di&s;covered in writing about religion. They threat|ened to put him to the <HI>Indians</HI> again, if he would not turn; telling him, <HI>He was nev|er bought out of their hands, but only &s;ojourn|ed with them, but if he would turn, he &s;hould never be put into their hands any more.</HI> The
<PB N="78" REF="039104_0076_1013C2B3F60E7870">
<HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> would &s;pend whole days in urging him. He was &s;ent to &s;chool to learn to read and write French; the &s;chool ma&s;ter &s;ometimes flattered him with promi&s;es, if he would <HI>cro&s;s</HI> him&s;elf, then threatened him if he would not. But when he &s;aw flattering promi&s;es of rewards, and threat|enings were ineffectual, he &s;truck him with a &s;tick he had in his hand; and when he &s;aw that would not do, he made him get down on his knees about an hour, and then came and bid him make the &s;ign of the <HI>cro&s;s,</HI> and that without any delay; he &s;till refu&s;ed. Then he gave him a couple of &s;trokes with a whip he had in his hand; which whip had three branches, and about twelve great knots tied to it: And again bid him make the &s;ign of the <HI>cro&s;s;</HI> and if it was any &s;in, he would bear it him&s;elf; and &s;aid al&s;o, <HI>You are a|fraid you &s;hall be changed if you do it; but</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>you will be the &s;ame, your fingers wont be changed.</HI> And after he had made him &s;hed many tears, under his abu&s;es and threatenings, he told him, <HI>He would have it done:</HI> And &s;o through cowardice and fear of the whip, he made the &s;ign, and did &s;o for &s;everal days together, and with much ado, he was fir&s;t brought to <HI>cro&s;s</HI> him&s;elf,
<PB N="79" REF="039104_0077_1013C307219D1658">
and then the ma&s;ter told him, <HI>He would have it done without his particular biding him.</HI> And when he came to &s;ay his le&s;&s;on, and cro&s;&s;ed not him&s;elf, the ma&s;ter &s;aid, <HI>Have you forgot what I bid you do?</HI> No Sir, &s;aid he: Then the &s;chool ma&s;ter &s;aid, <HI>Down on your knees;</HI> and &s;o kept him for an hour and an half, till &s;chool was done; and &s;o did for about a week.

In the afternoon, after &s;he had begged pardon for her wavering, the Catholick Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith was read a|loud to her in the hearing of Mr. <HI>Crafton,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Stil&s;on,</HI> and another <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> woman, and &s;he owned the &s;ame. About &s;even o'clock the &s;ame day, &s;he &s;aid to Mr. <HI>Dubi&s;on, Shall not they give me the holy com|munion?</HI> But her tongue was then &s;o thick that &s;he could hardly &s;wallow any thing.

<P>I HAVE here tran&s;cribed the letter in the very words of it, without the lea&s;t al|teration: The &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance was &s;ent to &s;everal other captives. When I had this letter, I pre&s;ently knew it to be of Mr. <HI>Meriel'</HI>s compo&s;ing; but the me&s;|&s;enger who brought the letter, brought word that my &s;on had embraced their re|ligion. Afterwards, when &s;ome blamed him for letting me know of it, becau&s;e (they &s;aid) they feared my &s;orrow would &s;horten my days; he told me he thought with him&s;elf, that if he was in my ca&s;e, he &s;hould be willing to know the wor&s;t, and therefore told me as he would have de|&s;ired to have known if in my place. I
<PB N="85" REF="039104_0083_1013C32D6EBF1638">
thanked him, acknowledging it a favour to let me know of it: But the news was ready to overwhelm me with grief and &s;orrow. <HI>I made my complaint to GOD, and mourned before him; &s;orrow and angui&s;h took hold upon me.</HI> I a&s;ked of GOD, to di|rect me what to do, and how to write, and find out an opportunity of conveying a letter to him; and committed this diffi|culty to his providence. I now found a greater oppo&s;ition to a patient, quiet, humble re&s;ignation to the will of GOD, than I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have known, if not &s;o tried. Here I thought of my af|flictions and trials; <HI>my wife</HI> and <HI>two chil|dren killed,</HI> and <HI>many of my neighbors;</HI> and <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> and <HI>&s;o many of my children and friends</HI> in a <HI>Popi&s;h captivity,</HI> &s;eparated from our children, not capable to come to them to in&s;truct them in the way they ought to go; and cunning, crafty enemies, u&s;ing all their &s;ubtilty to in&s;inuate into young ones, &s;uch principles as would be perni|cious. I thought with my&s;elf how hap|py many others were, in that they had their children with them, under all ad|vantages to bring them up in the <HI>nurture and admonition of the Lord;</HI> whil&s;t we
<PB N="86" REF="039104_0084_1013C389033E5668">
were &s;eparated one from another, and our children in great peril of embracing dam|nable doctrines. Oh! that all parents who read this hi&s;tory, would ble&s;s GOD for the advantages they have of educating their children, and faithfully improve it! I mourned when I thought with my&s;elf, that I had one child with the <HI>Macquas,</HI> a &s;econd turned to <HI>Popery,</HI> and a little child of &s;ix years of age, in danger from a child to be in&s;tructed in <HI>Popery;</HI> and knew full well, that all endeavours would be u&s;ed to prevent my &s;eeing or &s;peaking with them. But in the mid&s;t of all the&s;e, GOD gave me a &s;ecret hope, that he would magnify his power and free grace, and di&s;appoint all their crafty de&s;igns. <HI>When I looked on the right hand, and on the left, all refuge failed, and none &s;hewed any care for my &s;oul.</HI> But GOD brought that word to uphold me, <HI>who is able to do exceeding abundantly above what we can a&s;k or think.</HI> As al&s;o that, <HI>Is any thing too hard for God?</HI> I pray|ed to GOD to direct me; and wrote very &s;hort the fir&s;t time, and in general terms, fearing le&s;t if I &s;hould write about things in controver&s;y, my letter would come to him. I therefore addre&s;&s;ed him with the following letter:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Son Samuel,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE waited till now for an an&s;wer from you, hoping to hear from you, why you made an abjuration of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Faith</HI> for the <HI>Romi&s;h.</HI> But &s;ince you continue to neglect to write to me a|bout it, as you neglected to take any ad|vice or coun&s;el from a father, when you did it; I cannot forbear writing again, and making &s;ome reflections on the letter you wrote me la&s;t, about the two women. It &s;eems to me, from tho&s;e words of <HI>Abi|gail Turbet'</HI>s in your letter, or rather of Mr. <HI>Meriel'</HI>s, which you tran&s;cribed for him. ["<HI>Abigail Turbet</HI> &s;ent for Mr. <HI>Mer|iel,</HI> &s;he committed her &s;oul into his hand,
<PB N="90" REF="039104_0088_1013BE96DA61C0F0">
and was ready to do whatever he plea&s;ed."] I &s;ay, it &s;eems rational to believe, that &s;he had not the u&s;e of her rea&s;on; it is an ex|pre&s;&s;ion to be abhorred by all who have any true &s;en&s;e of religion. Was Mr. <HI>Meriel</HI> a GOD, a CHRIST? Could he bear to hear &s;uch words and not reject them; replying, 'Don't commit your &s;oul into my hands, but &s;ee that you commit your &s;oul into the hands of GOD through Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and do whatever GOD commands you in his holy word: As for me, I am a creature, and cannot &s;ave your &s;oul, but will tell you of <HI>Acts</HI> iv. 12. <HI>Neither is there &s;alvation in any other; for there is no other name under heaven given among men, whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved.</HI> Had he been a faithful mini&s;ter of JESUS CHRIST, he would have &s;aid, <HI>It is an honour due to</HI> CHRIST <HI>alone.</HI> The holy apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Now unto him that is able to keep you, and pre&s;ent you faultle&s;s before the pre&s;ence of his glory, with exceeding joy, to the only wi&s;e</HI> GOD <HI>our &s;aviour, be glory and maje&s;ty, dominion and power, both now and ever, amen,</HI> Jude 24, 25, ver&s;es. As to what you write a|bout praying to the <HI>virgin Mary,</HI> and oth|er &s;aints, I make this reply; Had Mr. <HI>Meriel</HI> done his duty, he would have &s;aid to them, as 1 <HI>Job,</HI> ii. 1, 2, <HI>If any man &s;in,
<PB N="91" REF="039104_0089_1013C33821542A60">
we have an advocate with the Father,</HI> JE|SUS CHRIST <HI>the righteous; and he is the propitiation of our &s;ins.</HI> The &s;criptures &s;ay, <HI>There is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man</HI> CHRIST JESUS. Yea, Chri&s;t &s;aid, Go and preach, <HI>He that believeth and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> The apo&s;tle in <HI>Gal.</HI> i. 8, &s;aith, <HI>But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other go&s;pel unto you, than that we have preached to you, let him be accur&s;ed.</HI> They never preached that we &s;hould pray to the <HI>virgin Mary,</HI> or other &s;aints. As you would be &s;aved, hear what the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>Heb.</HI> iv. 13, &amp;c. <HI>Neither is there any creature that is not manife&s;t in his &s;ight; but all things are naked, and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. Seeing then that we have a great High Prie&s;t that is en|tered into heaven,</HI> JESUS <HI>the &s;on of God, let us hold fa&s;t our profe&s;&s;ion: For we have not an high Prie&s;t that cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without &s;in; let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</HI> Which words do hold forth, how that CHRIST JESUS is in every re&s;pect qualified to be a <HI>media|tor</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="039104_0090_1013C3901DFF3AD0">
and <HI>interce&s;&s;or;</HI> and I am &s;ure they cannot be applied to any mere creature, to make them capable of our religious tru&s;t. When <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> have &s;aid all they can, they are not able to prove, that the &s;aints in heaven have a knowl|edge of prayers which are directed to them. Some &s;ay, they know them one way, others &s;ay, they have the knowledge of them in another way; and that which they have fixed upon as mo&s;t probable to them, is, That they know of them from their beholding the face of GOD; Seeing GOD, they know the&s;e prayers; But this is a great mi&s;take. Tho' the &s;aints &s;ee and know GOD in a glorious manner, yet they have not an infinite knowledge; and it does no ways follow, that becau&s;e they &s;ee GOD, they know all prayers that are directed to them upon the earth. And GOD has no where in his word told us, that the &s;aints have &s;uch a knowledge. Be&s;ides, were it a thing po&s;&s;ible for them to have a knowledge of what prayers are directed to them, it does not follow that they are to be prayed to, or have re|ligious honour conferred upon them. The <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> can neither give one &s;crip|ture precept or example for praying to
<PB N="93" REF="039104_0091_1013C33F76DB07A0">
them; but GOD has provided a <HI>mediator,</HI> who knows all our petitions, and is faith|ful and merciful enough; and we have both &s;cripture, precept and example, to look to him as our <HI>mediator</HI> and <HI>advocate</HI> with the Father. Further, it cannot be proved that it is con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;aints being creatures, as well as with their hap|pine&s;s, to have a knowledge of prayers from all parts of the world at the &s;ame time, from many millions together, about things &s;o va&s;tly differing one from anoth|er; and then to pre&s;ent tho&s;e &s;upplica|tions for all that look to them, is not hu|mility but will-wor&s;hip. <HI>Col.</HI> ii. 18, <HI>Let no man beguile you of your reward, in a vol|untary humility, wor&s;hipping of Angels,</HI> ver. 23, <HI>Which things indeed have a &s;hew of wi&s;dom and will-wor&s;hip and humility.</HI> For what humility can it be, to di&s;tru&s;t the way that GOD has provided and encour|aged us to come to him in, and impo&s;e upon GOD a way of our own devi&s;ing? Was not GOD angry with <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> for impo&s;ing upon him after &s;uch a &s;ort?

We do not &s;ay it is un|lawful to make or have a picture, but tho&s;e carved images were not in the tem|ple to be adored, bowed down to, or wor|&s;hipped. There is no manner of con&s;e|quence, that becau&s;e there were images made in <HI>Solomon'</HI>s temple that were not adored and wor&s;hipped, that therefore it is now lawful to make and fall down be|fore images, and pray to them, and &s;o wor&s;hip them. Religious wor&s;hipping of &s;aints, cannot be defended from, but is forbidden in the &s;criptures: and for fear of lo&s;ing their di&s;ciples, the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> keep away from them the Bible, and oblige them to believe as they &s;ay they mu&s;t be|lieve.

A bla&s;phemy to pretend to a power of making GOD at their plea&s;ure, and then eat him, and give him to others to be eaten, or &s;hut him up in their altars; that they can utter the &s;ame words, and make a GOD or not make a GOD, ac|cording to their intention; and that the people are obliged to believe that it is GOD, and &s;o adore it, when they never hear any word of con&s;ecration, nor know the <HI>Prie&s;t's</HI> intention.</P>

invention; not a word of &s;uch a &s;acrifice in the whole bible; its being a &s;acrifice propitiatory daily to be offered, is contra|ry to the holy &s;criptures. Heb. vii. 27, Who needeth not daily, as tho&s;e high prie&s;ts, to offer up &s;acrifice fir&s;t for his own &s;ins, and then for the people's: For this he did once when he offered up him|&s;elf. And yet the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> &s;ay, there is need that he be offered up as a &s;acrifice to GOD every day. "Heb. ix. 12, By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us: 25, 26, 27, 28, Nor yet that he &s;hould offer him&s;elf often, as the High Prie&s;t entereth into the holy place, every year with the blood of others: For then mu&s;t he often have &s;uffered &s;ince the foun|dation of the world: But now once in the end of the world, hath he appeared to put away &s;in by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf: As it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: So Chri&s;t was once of|fered to bear the &s;ins of many. Heb. x. 10, By which will we are &s;anctified, through the offering of the body of Je&s;us Chri&s;t once for all: Ver. 12, But this man, after he had offered one &s;acrifice for &s;ins, forever &s;at down on the right hand of

God: Ver. 14, For by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are &s;anc|tified." By which &s;cripture you may &s;ee that the <HI>ma&s;s</HI> is not of divine appointment, but an human invention. Their eva&s;ion of a bloody and an unbloody &s;acrifice, is a &s;ham: The holy &s;criptures &s;peak not one word of Chri&s;t's being offered as a &s;acrifice propitiatory, after &s;uch a &s;ort as they call an unbloody &s;acrifice. All the ceremo|nies of the <HI>ma&s;s</HI> are human inventions, that GOD never commanded.</P>
<P>As to what is in the letter about pray|ing for the women after their death, is very ridiculous. For, <HI>As the tree falls, &s;o it lies;</HI> as <HI>death leaves, judgment will find:</HI> No change after death from an afflicted to an happy place and &s;tate. Purgatory is a fancy for the enriching the clergy, and impoveri&s;hing the laity.

The &s;oul at death goes immediately to judgment, and &s;o to heaven or hell. No authentic place of &s;cripture mentions &s;o much as one word of any &s;uch place or &s;tate.

<P>Bethink your&s;elf, and con&s;ult the &s;crip|tures, if you can get them: (I mean the bible.)

Can that religion be true that cannot bear an examination from the &s;criptures, that are a perfect rule in mat|ters of faith; or that mu&s;t be upheld by ignorance, e&s;pecially ignorance of the ho|ly &s;criptures?</P>

But they affirmed it to be true, telling me how God approved of their religion, and witne&s;&s;ed miraculou&s;|ly

again&s;t ours. But I &s;till told them, <HI>I was per&s;uaded his &s;oul was in heaven, and that their reports were only devi&s;ed fables to &s;educe &s;ouls.</HI> For &s;everal weeks they af|firmed it, telling me, <Q>That all who came over the river from the i&s;land affirmed it to be a truth,</Q> I begged of God to bla&s;t this helli&s;h de&s;ign of theirs; &s;o that in the i&s;&s;ue it might be to render their re|ligion more abominable, and that they might not gain one &s;oul by &s;uch a &s;trata|gem. After &s;ome weeks had pa&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions, there came one into my landlord's hou&s;e, affirming it to be a truth reported of <HI>Zebediah;</HI> &s;aying, <Q><HI>Jo&s;eph Eg|erly</HI> had been over the river and told one of our neighbors this &s;tory,</Q> After a few hours I &s;aw that neighbor, and a&s;ked him, whether he had &s;een <HI>Egerly</HI> lately? he &s;aid, Yes; What news told he you? None, &s;aid he. Then I told him what was af|firmed as a truth; he an&s;wered, <Q><HI>Egerly</HI> &s;aid nothing like this to him, and he was per&s;uaded that he would have told him, if there had been any truth in it.</Q> About a week after came one <HI>John Boult</HI> from the i&s;land of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> a lad taken from <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> a very &s;erious, &s;ober lad, of about &s;eventeen years of age: He had of|ten

before come over with <HI>Zebediah</HI> to vi&s;|it me. At his coming in he much lament|ed the lo&s;s of <HI>Zebediah;</HI> and told me, <Q>That for &s;everal weeks they had told him the &s;ame &s;tory, affirming it to be a truth, and that <HI>Egerly</HI> was &s;o awakened by it, as to go again to <HI>ma&s;s</HI> every day;</Q> urging him, <Q>&s;ince GOD in &s;uch a mirac|ulous way offered &s;uch conviction of the truth of their religion, and the fal&s;e|hood and danger of ours, to come over to their religion, or el&s;e his damnation would be dreadfully aggravated.</Q> He &s;aid, <Q><HI>He could have no re&s;t for them day and night;</HI></Q> but (&s;aid he) <Q><HI>I told them their religion was contrary to the WORD of GOD, and therefore I would not em|brace it; and that I did not believe what they &s;aid.</HI></Q> And &s;ays he to me, <Q>One day I was &s;itting in the hou&s;e, and <HI>E|gerly</HI> came in, and I &s;pake to him before the whole family, (in the <HI>French</HI> tongue, for he could not &s;peak much <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>) and a&s;ked him of this &s;tory:</Q> He an|&s;wered, <HI>It is a great fal&s;ehood,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>he never appeared to me, nor have I ever re|ported any &s;uch thing to any body; and that he had never been at the ma&s;s &s;ince</HI> Zebedi|ah's <HI>death.</HI> At the hearing of which, they
<PB N="117" REF="039104_0115_1013C365E91866A8">
were &s;ilenced and put to &s;hame. We ble&s;&s;ed GOD together, for di&s;covering their wickedne&s;s, and di&s;appointing them in what they aimed at; and prayed to GOD to deliver us and all the captives from delu&s;ions, and recover them who had fallen, and &s;o parted. After which I took my pen and wrote a letter to one <HI>Samuel Hill,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> captive, taken from <HI>Wells,</HI> who lived at <HI>Quebeck,</HI> and his brother <HI>Ebenezer Hill,</HI> to make a di&s;|covery of this lying plot, to warn them of their danger, and a&s;&s;ure them of the fal&s;hood of this report; but the letter fell into the hands of the <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> and was nev|er delivered. This <HI>Egerly</HI> came home with us, &s;o that they gained nothing but &s;hame by their &s;tratagem: God often di&s;|appoints the crafty devices of wicked men.</P>
<P>In the latter end of &s;ummer, they told me, <Q>they had news from <HI>New-England,</HI> by one who had been a captive at <HI>Bo&s;|ton,</HI> who &s;aid that the mini&s;ters at <HI>Bo&s;|ton</HI> had told the <HI>French</HI> captives, that the <HI>prote&s;tant religion</HI> was the only true religion; and that as a confirmation of it, they would rai&s;e a dead per&s;on to life before their eyes, for their convic|tion; and that having per&s;uaded one to
<PB N="118" REF="039104_0116_1013C3B64CEEA758">
feign him&s;elf dead, they came and pray|ed over him, and then commanded him <HI>in the name of Chri&s;t</HI> (who&s;e religion they kept pure) to ari&s;e; they called and commanded, but he never aro&s;e; &s;o that in&s;tead of rai&s;ing the dead, they killed the living, which the bereaved relations di&s;covered.</Q> I told them, <Q><HI>It was an old lie and calumny again&s;t</HI> Luther <HI>and</HI> Calvin, <HI>new vamped, and that they only change the per&s;ons and place;</HI></Q> but they affirmed it to be a truth; I told them, <Q><HI>I wondered they were &s;o fond of a faith prop|agated, and then maintained by lying words.</HI></Q></P>
<P>We were always out of hopes of being returned before winter, the &s;ea&s;on prov|ing &s;o cold the latter end of September, and were praying to GOD to prepare our hearts with an holy &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his holy will, to glorify his holy name in a way of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, in the winter. For my own part, I was informed by &s;everal who came from the city, that the <HI>Lord Intendant</HI> &s;aid, if <HI>More</HI> returned, and brought word that <HI>Battis</HI> was in pri&s;on, he would put me in pri&s;on, and lay me in irons. They would not permit me to go into the city, &s;aying, <HI>I always did harm
<PB N="119" REF="039104_0117_1013C36A025D06B8">
when I came to the city,</HI> and if at any time I was at the city, they would per&s;uade the governor to &s;end me back again.</P>
<P>In the beginning of la&s;t June, the Su|perior of the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> came to the pari&s;h where I was, and told me, <Q>He &s;aw I wanted my friend, captain <HI>de Beauville,</HI> and that I was ragged:</Q> But &s;ays he, <Q>Your ob&s;tinacy again&s;t our religion, di&s;courages us from providing better clothes;</Q> I told him, <Q><HI>It was better go|ing in a ragged coat, than with a ragged con&s;cience.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In the beginning of la&s;t June, went out an army of five hundred <HI>Macquas</HI> and <HI>In|dians,</HI> with an intention to have fallen on &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> towns down <HI>Connecticut riv|er,</HI> but lighting on a <HI>Scatacook Indian,</HI> who afterwards ran away in the night, they were di&s;couraged; &s;aying, <HI>He would a|larm the whole country.</HI> About fifty, as &s;ome &s;ay, or eighty, as others, returned: Thus GOD re&s;trained their wrath.</P>
<P>When they were promi&s;ing them&s;elves another winter, to draw away the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to <HI>Popery,</HI> news came that an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> brigantine was coming; and that the honourable Capt. <HI>Samuel Appleton,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> was coming amba&s;&s;ador, to fetch off the

Some they urged to tarry at lea&s;t till the &s;pring of the year; telling them, it was &s;o late in the year, they would be lo&s;t by &s;hipwreck, if they went now; &s;ome younger ones they told, if they went home they would be damned and burnt in hell forever, to affright them; day and night they were urging them to &s;tay. And I was threatened to be &s;ent aboard, without a permi&s;&s;ion to come a&s;hore again, if I &s;hould again di&s;cour&s;e with any of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who were turned to their religion: At <HI>Montreal</HI> e&s;pecially, all crafty endeav|ours were u&s;ed to &s;tay the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> They told my child, if he would &s;tay, he &s;hould have an honourable pen&s;ion from the king every year, and that his ma&s;ter, who was and old man, and the riche&s;t in <HI>Can|ada,</HI> would give him a great deal; telling him if he returned, he would be poor, for (&s;aid they) your father is poor, has lo&s;t all his e&s;tate, it was all burnt; but he would not be prevailed with to &s;tay.

They endeavour|ed in the Fall of the year, to prevail with my &s;on to go to <HI>France,</HI> when they &s;aw he would not come to their communion any more. One woman belonging to the ea&s;tern parts, who had by their per|&s;ua&s;ions, married an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> captive taken the la&s;t war, came away with her hu&s;band, which made them &s;ay, they were &s;orry they ever per&s;uaded her to turn to their religion, and then to marry; for in&s;tead of advancing their cau&s;e by it, they had weakened it; for now they had not only lo&s;t her, but another they thought they had made &s;ure of. Another woman be|longing to the ea&s;tward, who had been flattered to their religion, to whom a Bi|ble was denied till &s;he promi&s;ed to em|brace their religion, and then had the promi&s;e of it for a little time; opening her Bible whil&s;t in the church and pre&s;|ent at <HI>ma&s;s,</HI> &s;he read the fourth chapter of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> and received &s;uch conviction whil&s;t reading, that before her fir&s;t com|munion &s;he fell off from them, and could never be prevailed with any more to be of their religion.</P>

<P>We came away from <HI>Quebeck,</HI> October 25; and by contrary winds, and a great &s;torm, we were retarded, and then driv|en back nigh the city, and had a great deliverance from &s;hipwreck, the ve&s;&s;el &s;triking twice on a rock in that &s;torm.

<P>At our arrival at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> we found the kindne&s;&s;es of the Lord in a wonderful manner, in GOD'S opening the hearts of many, to ble&s;s GOD with us and for us; wonderfully to give for our &s;upplies in our needy &s;tate. We are under obliga|tion to prai&s;e GOD, for di&s;po&s;ing of the hearts of &s;o many to &s;o great charity; and under great bonds to pray for a ble&s;&s;|ing on the heads, hearts and families of them, who &s;o liberally and plentifully gave for our relief. It is certain, that the charity of the whole country of <HI>Cana|da,</HI> though moved with the doctrine of merit, does not come up to the charity of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> alone, where notions of merits are rejected; but acts of charity performed out of a right chri&s;tian &s;pirit, from a &s;pir|it of thankfulne&s;s to GOD, out of obedi|ence to GOD'S command, and unfeigned love and charity to them that are of the &s;ame family and hou&s;ehold of faith. The Lord grant, that all who devi&s;e &s;uch liber|al things, may find the accompli&s;hment of the promi&s;es made by GOD, in their

<P>I SHALL annex a &s;hort account, of the troubles beginning to ari&s;e in <HI>Can|ada.</HI> On May 16, arrived a canoe at <HI>Quebeck,</HI> that brought letters from <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;|&s;ippi,</HI> written the May preceding; giving an account that the plague was there, and that one hundred and fifty <HI>French</HI> in a ve|ry little time had died of it; and that the &s;avages, called the <HI>Lezilouways</HI> were very turbulent, and had with their arrows wounded a <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> in five places, and killed a <HI>Frenchman</HI> that waited on him. In Ju|ly, news came, that the nations up the river were engaged in a war, one again&s;t the other; and that the <HI>French</HI> living &s;o a|mong them, and trading with them, were in great danger; that the <HI>Mitchel Macqui|nas</HI> had made war with the <HI>Mizianmies,</HI> and had killed a <HI>Mendicant Friar,</HI> and three other <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> and eleven <HI>&s;avages,</HI> at a place called the <HI>Straits,</HI> where they are &s;et|tling a garri&s;on and place for traffic; the <HI>Michel Macquinas</HI> had taken &s;ixteen <HI>Frenchmen</HI> pri&s;oners, and burnt their trad|ing hou&s;es.

<P>THE infinitely wi&s;e Di&s;|po&s;er of all things, who aims at his own glory, in the governing of rational crea|tures, doth &s;ometimes bring per&s;ons into the depths of di&s;tre&s;s; and then magnify
<PB N="128" REF="039104_0125_1013C3C2967E02C8">
his power and grace in rai&s;ing, them up out of their afflictions: And in many, re&s;pects by &s;uch things, he has a de&s;ign of advancing his own glory in the world. We find in the context, a per&s;on in a ve|ry doleful, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition: He &s;eems to be for&s;aken of GOD, and made a po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion and dwelling place of evil &s;pirits, de|prived of all human comforts, made to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;orrow and pain to &s;uch a degree, as to be a common &s;ubject, or a theme of di&s;cour&s;e for all men to relate doleful things about. And afterward, GOD in very remarkable and wonderful works of power and mercy, not only gives relea&s;e from his &s;orrowful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but he is <HI>&s;itting at the feet of Je&s;us, clothed, and in his right mind.</HI> Now this was done for the manife&s;t glory of GOD. For when this man (for whom &s;uch great things had been done) petitions Chri&s;t that he may abide with him, to hear from him, and pay his re&s;pects to him; he receives commandment, to glorify the power and mercy of GOD, in declaring to others what great things GOD had done for him.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCT. It well becomes tho&s;e who have had eminent mercies, to &s;hew to others what great things GOD has done for them.</HEAD>
<P>The holy &s;criptures in many places confirm this truth. See Exod. xii. 25, 26, 27, <HI>And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, when ye be come to the land, which the Lord will give you, according as he hath promi&s;ed, that ye &s;hall keep this &s;ervice. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, when your children &s;hall &s;ay unto you, What mean you by this &s;ervice, that ye &s;hall &s;ay, It is the &s;acrifice of the Lord's pa&s;&s;over, who pa&s;&s;ed over the hou&s;es of the children of I&s;|rael in Egypt, when he &s;mote the Egyptians, and delivered our hou&s;es.</HI> Exod. xiii. 8, 10, <HI>And thou &s;halt &s;hew thy &s;on in that day, &s;aying,
<PB N="130" REF="039104_0127_1013C3C452D31F50">
This is done becau&s;e of that which the Lord did unto me, when I came forth out of Egypt. Thou &s;halt therefore keep this ordinance in his &s;ea&s;on from year to year.</HI> P&s;al. lxxviii. 3, 4, <HI>Which we have heard and known, and our fa|thers have told us; we will not hide them from their children, &s;hewing to the generation to come the prai&s;es of the Lord, and his &s;trength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</HI> In the pro&s;ecution and handling of this truth, con&s;ider,</P>
<P>I. They who have had mercies, have had them from GOD. God is the be&s;tow|er and giver of all our good things: All our mercies come to us by a divine provi|dence, and ordering; not by ca&s;ualty or ac|cident: Neither are they of our own pro|curing and purcha&s;ing, or others, &s;o as to exclude the providential di&s;po&s;ing of God. 'Tis God who returns the captivity of Zi|on. P&s;al.cxxvi, <HI>beg. When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream: Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with &s;inging. Then &s;aid they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad: Turn again our captivity, O Lord.</HI> The very Heathen acknowledge the
<PB N="131" REF="039104_0128_1013C4177122E350">
good things be&s;towed upon, and done for the church, to be from God; and God's own people acknowledge him for the mercies granted, and humbly &s;uppli|cate mercies from him for the future. 'Tis God who gathers the outca&s;ts of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> 'Tis he who takes away the cap|tives of the mighty, the prey of the ter|rible: Who contends with them that contend with us, and &s;aves our children, 'Tis God who di&s;per&s;eth and gathers a|gain: Therefore the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> ciii. <HI>begin.</HI> calls upon his &s;oul to ble&s;s the Lord, and not to forget all his benefits; and &s;aith, 'tis God <HI>who forgiveth all thy iniqui|ties, who healeth all thy di&s;ea&s;es: Who re|deemed thy life from de&s;truction, who crown|eth thee with loving kindne&s;s and tender mer|cies,</HI> &amp;c. Sometimes, God in a more immediate and extraordinary way and manner confers ble&s;&s;ings and mercies, &s;ometimes in a more ordinary and medi|ate way; but his providence is to be ac|knowledged in all: Not one &s;ingle mer|cy comes to us, without a commi&s;&s;ion from that God by whom our very hairs are numbered.</P>
<P>II. It well becomes tho&s;e who have had eminent mercies, to &s;hew to others
<PB N="132" REF="039104_0129_1013C3C965811AD0">
what great things God hath done for them. Therefore you find the holy P&s;almi&s;t calling upon others, to give a li&s;tening ear, whil&s;t he makes a narration of the &s;alvations he had from God, P&s;al. lxvi. 16, <HI>Come and bear all you that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my &s;oul.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t. Rea&s;on.</HI> Becau&s;e God aimed at the advancement of his own glory, in the giving and dealing out of the&s;e mercies. God makes and di&s;po&s;eth all things for his own glory. All works of Providence, are &s;ome way or other to advance the glory of God in the world. The glory of his power, wi&s;dom, mercy ju&s;tice and holine&s;s, are &s;ome way or other advanced in a manife&s;tive way and manner. Now it well becomes us, to fall in with the de&s;ign of God, and in an active manner to give him glory. That God de&s;igns to have glory given to him is evident from P&s;al. 1. 15, <HI>And call upon me in the day of trou|ble, I will deliver thee, and thou &s;halt glorify me.</HI> Exod. vii. 5, <HI>And the Egyptians &s;hall know that I am the Lord, when I &s;tretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of I&s;rael from among them.</HI> God has a de&s;ign to magnify his power, mercy

<P N="2">2<HI>d.

So that in obedience to God, and an&s;wering that high and noble end we were made for, it is requi&s;ite that in this way we glo|rify God. It is enough, that the great God who hath taken us into <HI>covenant re|lation</HI> to him&s;elf, has enjoined us to &s;hew forth his prai&s;es in rehear&s;ing to others the &s;alvations and favours we have been the &s;ubjects of.

P&s;al. xxxiv. 2, 3, 4, 6, <HI>My &s;oul &s;hall make her boa&s;t in the Lord; the humble &s;hall hear thereof, and be glad. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.

And Jethro &s;aid, Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. Now I know that the Lord is greater than all Gods, for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly, he was above them.</HI> By this means thanks will be given to God by many: As ma|ny have been praying to God for them, &s;o many will be prai&s;ing and ble&s;&s;ing God with them and for them.</P>

<P>God hath made tho&s;e who&s;e characters have been, that they were &s;uch who&s;e tender mercies were cruelties; &s;uch from whom, one act of pity or compa&s;&s;ion could &s;carce be expected, even &s;uch who have delighted in cruelty; to pity and compa&s;&s;ionate &s;uch who were led into captivity by them. Made them bear on their arms, and carry on their &s;houlders our little ones, unable to travel. Feed their pri&s;oners with the be&s;t of their pro|vi&s;ions: Yea, &s;ometimes pinch them|&s;elves, as to their daily food, rather than their captives. To pity them under &s;ick|ne&s;s, and afford all proper means for the re&s;toration of their health, or recovery from lamene&s;s. Made heathen's bowels yearn towards poor infants expo&s;ed to death, &s;o as to work out their deliverance from fatal &s;trokes, by burdening them|&s;elves. Oh! let us adore the riches of the grace of God, who in wrath remem|bers mercy, and doth not &s;tir up all his wrath; and from hence be encouraged, when under convictions of God's being
<PB N="141" REF="039104_0138_1013C422D2FDA608">
angry with us, yet to look to him for mercy.</P>
<P>God has upheld many poor &s;ouls un|der all manner of di&s;advantages, as to getting knowledge, and kept them from falling, though crafty adver&s;aries were un|der all advantages, and painful endeavours u&s;ed to &s;educe them. Being without bi|bles, mini&s;ters or chri&s;tian friends to con|fer with, daily harra&s;&s;ed with temptations and tempters: Some threatened, &s;ome flattered, &s;ome &s;hut up and confined in <HI>Mona&s;teries,</HI> where no means were un|e&s;&s;ayed to gain them to change their reli|gion.</P>
<P>God has &s;trengthened them to go thro' tedious journeys, and renewed &s;trength, when they were even fainting in their &s;pir|its; thinking it not po&s;&s;ible to travel five miles, and yet enabled to travel at lea&s;t forty in a day. Remarkably ordering &s;ea&s;ons, &s;o as to be for their comfort in their travels; cau&s;ing a moi&s;t &s;now to fall on the lake, only to &s;uch a height as to make it ea&s;y to their &s;woln and wounded feet: Changing the winds for their advantages, in petty voyages in their tickli&s;h canoes.</P>
<P>They have found God a little &s;anctua|ry to them, in the land of &s;trangers: e|ven
<PB N="142" REF="039104_0139_1013C3DB5E164D10">

<P>They have found God, a God hearing prayers, when they have gone to him with their mo&s;t difficult ca&s;es; pre&s;erving them from falling; recovering them form falls; to making void the coun&s;els of adver&s;a|ries, di&s;appointing them in the things they dealt mo&s;t proudly in. God has brought his to a re&s;ignation to his will, and then appeared dealing out mercies, as the very ca&s;e did require.</P>
<P>God has &s;anctified to &s;ome, their form|er &s;abbath &s;olemn attendances on duties of piety, private as well as public; and a religious education to be an unan&s;werable objection again&s;t &s;uch who were zealous for the <HI>traditions of men,</HI> to a vi&s;ible pro|faning God's &s;abbaths. They dur&s;t not embrace that religion, the principles of which, as well as practi&s;es, were &s;o contra|ry to the precepts of God's holy wrod. Oh! how &s;hould mini&s;ters and parents be encouraged from hence to u&s;e their ut|mo&s;t care, that God's &s;abbaths may be

duly &s;anctified by all under their charge; and that they would be exemplary before others, in a due ob&s;ervance of holy time.</P>
<P>God has made the falls of &s;ome to <HI>Po|pery,</HI> a means for the recovery of others; and making tho&s;e things, by which the adver&s;ary thought to increa&s;e their numbers and pro&s;elytes, to be occa&s;ional of recover|ing &s;uch who from their youth had been educated in the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> way; having been taken captives when young. Do not be di&s;couraged and &s;ay, your friends and rela|tions have (being captivated when young) for a long time lived in <HI>Popery,</HI> and there|fore no hopes of recovery; for God can make dry bones, very dry, to live, and can in ways unthought of by you, both recover them after they have fallen, and return them again. The adver&s;aries have &s;ome|times pretended <HI>miracles</HI> for the confirma|tion of their religion, that they might &s;e|duce to <HI>Popery;</HI> in fallacious ways cau&s;ed reports that &s;ome captives died <HI>Papi&s;ts;</HI> that one appeared in flames of fire to bear a te&s;timony again&s;t the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion;</HI> but God has in his wi&s;e providence, made known their fal&s;ehoods and lies.</P>
<P>They have &s;ought to per&s;uade &s;ome, by &s;ums of money, to change their religion,

<P>The reading the fourth chapter of <HI>Deu|teronomy,</HI> a means of recovering one from <HI>Popery.</HI></P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX. By the Rev. JOHN TAYLOR, the pre&s;ent Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, in Deerfield; con|taining &s;ome account of the mi&s;chief done by the enemy, in Deerfield, and its vicin|ity, from the death of the Rev. Mr. WILLIAMS, to the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t French War.</HEAD>
<P>THE readers of this Appen|dix, will probably feel de&s;irous of know|ing the rea&s;ons, why, in many things, I have been &s;o general; only having given a brief &s;tatement of facts; and in others, have been more particular. I tru&s;t, it will be a &s;ufficient apology to ob&s;erve, That I have done it for the want of bet|ter documents. Mo&s;t of the facts men|tioned, I have taken from the minutes of &s;ome gentlemen, who kept them, only for their own &s;atisfaction, and were not particular; and now, the di&s;tance of time, precludes the po&s;&s;ibility of obtaining &s;uch an account of circum&s;tances, as may be depended on.</P>
<P>One rea&s;on, of my adding this appen|dix, is, I &s;uppo&s;e that it will not be di&s;a|greeable to any who were de&s;irous that the Narrative &s;hould be reprinted, e&s;peci|ally
<PB N="160" REF="039104_0157_1013C3F5019CFAA8">
the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e who were either killed, wounded, or captivated; and for this rea&s;on, I have been careful al&s;o to mention the names of &s;uch.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on is,&mdash;I think that every ve&s;tige of hi&s;tory, which re&s;pects the ear|ly &s;ettlement of a country, &s;hould be pre|&s;erved, for the &s;atisfaction of future gen|erations.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t account of mi&s;chief, men|tioned in the former Appendix, done by the enemy in this part of the country, was in Augu&s;t, 1725. This year, terminated the war. A treaty of peace was held at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> by commi&s;&s;ioners from the Gen|eral Court, and the Chiefs of the Indian tribes; at which, articles were &s;igned, and a long peace en&s;ued.</P>
<P>There appeared, for many years, an unu&s;ually pacific &s;pirit among the In|dians; probably in con&s;equence of &s;ome acts of the General Court, favourable to them in their trade. It was thought, that they never again would have been di&s;po&s;ed to ho&s;tilities, had they not been under the immediate influence of the French intere&s;t.</P>
<P>War was declared between <HI>France</HI> and
<PB N="161" REF="039104_0158_1013C43DE999F2B8">
<HI>England, March,</HI> 1744. The fir&s;t year of the war, no Indians made their appear|ance in this part of the country: They had found by experience, that to main|tain an open trade with the Engli&s;h, was greatly for their intere&s;t; and con&s;equent|ly at fir&s;t, entered into the war with re|luctance.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t mi&s;chief that I can obtain an account of, done by the enemy, in this part of the country, in the cour&s;e of this war, was in <HI>July,</HI> 1745; when a few In|dians came to a place called the <HI>Great Meadow,</HI> about 16 miles above fort <HI>Dum|mer,</HI> on Connecticut River; two of whom, captivated William Phips, as he was hoe|ing his corn. After having taken, and led him about half a mile, they made a &s;tand; and as the Indians afterwards in|formed, one of them having laid down his gun, and gone a few rods, for the purpo&s;e of fetching &s;omething he had left, on his return, Phips took up the Indian's gun, fired upon, and killed him; then fell up|on the other with his hoe, &s;truck him down, and brui&s;ed him, 'till he &s;uppo&s;ed he was dead; he then attempted to make his e&s;cape, but unfortunately, three more
<PB N="162" REF="039104_0159_1013C3FC1363D630">
of the enemy came upon him, and killed him.</P>
<P>The &s;ame month, deacon Jo&s;iah Fi&s;h|er, was killed, and &s;calped at a place call|ed the upper <HI>A&s;hwelot.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 11<HI>th.</HI> The fort at the <HI>Great Meadow,</HI> was attacked by a large party of French and Indians; the attack was bold, and furious, but without &s;ucce&s;s. No lives were lo&s;t. Nehemiah How was ta|ken captive, and carried to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> where he &s;oon died. The enemy on their re|turn, met one David Rugg, with another per&s;on, pa&s;&s;ing down Connecticut river in a canoe; Rugg they killed, and &s;calped, the other per&s;on, with &s;ome difficulty, made his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>I can find no farther account of mi&s;|chief done by the enemy, in this part of the country, in the year 1745, but in 46 they began in &s;ea&s;on, and the &s;ufferings of the people were very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>In <HI>April,</HI> the enemy made their appear|ance at No. 4, (now <HI>Charle&s;ton,</HI>) which was then the mo&s;t northern &s;ettlement, on Connecticut river; Capt. John Spafford, I&s;aac Parker, and Stephen Farn&s;worth, being at a little di&s;tance from the fort, were captivated and carried to <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="039104_0160_1013C441BB999950">
The &s;ame month, a party of Indians ambu&s;hed the road, between <HI>Northfield</HI> and <HI>Lunenburgh,</HI> and killed Jo&s;hua Hol|ton.</P>
<P>On the 23d of the &s;ame month, a large party of the enemy, came to the upper <HI>A&s;hwelot,</HI> with a de&s;ign to have taken the fort by &s;urpri&s;e, but being di&s;covered by a per&s;on who was providentially, at that time, at a little di&s;tance from the garri&s;on, they were di&s;concerted; an action howev|er en&s;ued, which continued for &s;ome time; the enemy finally withdrew. In this action, John Bullard was killed, Na|than Blake was captivated, and the wife of Daniel M'Kinne, being out of the fort, was overtaken and &s;tabbed. Before the enemy retired, they burnt &s;everal build|ings, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been done, not &s;o much for the &s;ake of mi&s;|chief, as to conceal their dead; there be|ing many human bones afterwards found among the a&s;hes.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> the enemy again appeared at No. 4; a few people were near a barn, about &s;ixty rods from the fort, when they were fired upon by a con&s;iderable body of the natives who had concealed them&s;elves in the barn, Seth Put|nam,
<PB N="164" REF="039104_0161_1013C3FD99F47478">
a &s;oldier belonging to the fort, was kill|ed; whil&s;t the enemy were endeavouring to &s;calp him, Major Willard, commander of the garri&s;on, with two &s;oldiers, ran near to them undi&s;covered, and fired upon them, upon which they retreated in great ha&s;te. The Indians afterwards re|ported to the pri&s;oners in <HI>Canada,</HI> that at this time, two of their number were mortally wounded, and died &s;oon after.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 6th, a large party of Indians made an attempt upon the fort at <HI>Falltown;</HI> (now <HI>Bernard&s;ton,</HI>) a per&s;on about forty rods from the fort di&s;covering them, gave information to another farther di&s;tant than him&s;elf; by this, the enemy found they were di&s;covered, and ran immediately to the fort; an attack commenced, which continued for &s;ome time, and tho' there were but three &s;oldiers in the fort, they defended it till the enemy withdrew. John Burk was &s;lightly wounded, one hou&s;e was burnt, and about ten cattle were kill|ed. Two Indians were mortally wound|ed, who died &s;oon after their return.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day, Serg. John Hawks, and John Miles, were fired upon by two Indians, as they were riding out from fort Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and were both wound|ed:
<PB N="165" REF="039104_0162_1013C444EA485358">
Miles made his e&s;cape to the fort; Hawks fought for &s;ome time, and as af|terwards appeared, might have taken them both pri&s;oners, had he under&s;tood their language; they a&s;ked him for quar|ter before he turned to make his e&s;cape.</P>
<P N="10">10<HI>th.</HI> Five of that party of Indians, who the day before had been at <HI>Falltown</HI> fort, ambu&s;hed the road at <HI>Colrain.</HI> Mat|thew Clark, with his wife and daughter, together with two &s;oldiers were fired up|on, a few rods from the fort; Clark was killed, and his wife and daughter were wounded; one of the &s;oldiers returning the fire, killed one of the enemy, which gave them a check, and he brought the wounded into the fort.</P>
<P>A few days after, about twenty men were out, fifty or &s;ixty rods from the fort, at No. 4, viewing the place where Par|ker was killed on the 2d of the month, and before they di&s;covered an enemy, they were fired upon by a large body of Indians, who immediately endeavoured to cut off their communication with the fort; Capt. Stevens, commander of the garri&s;on, came out with a body of men for their relief, a &s;evere action en&s;ued, which continued for &s;ome time; at
<PB N="166" REF="039104_0163_1013C3FF1E7921D8">
la&s;t the enemy fled; and as was &s;uppo&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. Capt. Stevens lo&s;t three, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Aaron Lyon, Peter Per|rin, and Jo&s;eph Marcy; he had four wounded, and one taken captive.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 11<HI>th.</HI> A party of the enemy again appeared at fort Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; a num|ber of men being at &s;ome di&s;tance from the fort, were attacked, and a &s;kirmi&s;h en|&s;ued: The enemy fled, after &s;u&s;taining the fire but a few moments. Eli&s;ha Nims, and Ger&s;hom Hawks were wounded; and Benjamin Tenter was captivated. One of the enemy was killed.</P>
<P N="19">19<HI>th.</HI> A large body of the enemy a|gain appeared at No. 4; Capt. Stevens, and Capt. Brown, marching with about fifty men from the fort into the meadow, were ambu&s;hed; the enemy were di&s;cov|ered before they fired: Stevens began the attack, and a &s;evere action was fought; after &s;ome time the enemy were repul&s;ed, and retreated in great ha&s;te. Capt. Stevens lo&s;t none on the &s;pot. Jed|idiah Winchel was mortally wounded, and died &s;oon after. David Parker, Jon|athan Stanhope, and Noah Heaton were al&s;o wounded, but recovered.</P>
<P N="20">20th. A party of about twenty Indians

Ebenezer Philips was killed; the remainder made their e&s;cape to the fort; the enemy &s;ur|rounded the garri&s;on, and endeavoured,

<P N="20">20<HI>th.</HI> An army of about nine hundred French and Indians, under the command of Gen. de Vaudreuil, made an attack upon fort Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. The fort was commanded by Col. Hawks, who, was not in a &s;ituation to defend it again&s;t &s;uch a force, having but thirty three per&s;ons, both of men, women, and children, in the fort; and being mi&s;erably provided with ammunition; with great fortitude, however, he defended it for twenty eight hours; and had not his am|munition failed, it is probable he never would have given up the fort. He was,
<PB N="169" REF="039104_0166_1013C4494F1C4558">
finally, nece&s;&s;itated to capitulate; and he offered &s;uch articles as were accepted by de Vaudreuil. One <HI>&s;pecial</HI> article in this capitulation, was, that none of the pri&s;on|ers &s;hould be delivered into the hands of the Indians; the next day, however, Vau|dreuil divided the pri&s;oners, and deliver|ed them one half, in open violation, and contempt of the article.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. de Vaudreuil's plea for this breach of &s;aith, was, the danger of mutiny in his army, the Indians being irritated to a great degree, on ac|count of their being cut off, by the capitulation, from all the profits of the conque&s;t. But, how far this plea was a ju&s;tification of &s;uch perfidy, I leave to the judicious to determine.</NOTE> The Indians immediately killed one, who, by rea&s;on of &s;ickne&s;s, was unable to travel. The pri&s;oners were, in general, treated with civility, mo&s;t of whom were afterwards redeemed. Col. Hawks lo&s;t but one man in the &s;iege. Gen. de Vaudreuil, according to the be&s;t accounts the pri&s;on|ers could obtain, lo&s;t forty five, who were either killed outright, or died of their wounds.</P>
<P>Immediately after the capture of the fort, a party of about fifty Indians came
<PB N="170" REF="039104_0167_1013C408A23BA048">
on, for the purpo&s;e of making depreda|tions upon <HI>Deerfield.</HI> They came fir&s;t upon a hill, at the &s;outh we&s;t corner of the &s;outh meadow, where they di&s;covered ten, or twelve, men and children at work, in a &s;ituation, in which they might all, with ea&s;e, be made pri&s;oners. Had they &s;ucceeded in their de&s;ign, which was, to obtain pri&s;oners, rather than &s;calps, it is probable that events would not have been &s;o di&s;a&s;trous as they proved. They were di&s;concerted by the following circum|&s;tance: Mr. Eleazer Hawks was out that morning a fowling, and was provi|dentially at the foot of the hill, at the time the enemy came down; they, &s;ee|ing him, &s;uppo&s;ed they were di&s;covered, and immediately fired upon him, killed, and &s;calped him. This gave an alarm to the people in the meadow, &s;ome of whom were di&s;tant but a few rods. The ene|my were now &s;en&s;ible, that what they did mu&s;t be done with di&s;patch. According|ly they ru&s;hed into the meadow, fired on Simeon Am&s;den, a lad, and killed him, beheaded, and &s;calped him. Mr. Sam|uel Allen, John Sadler, and Adonijah Gillet, ran a few rods, and made a &s;tand, under a bank of the river, where they
<PB N="171" REF="039104_0168_1013C44D6232DA30">
were attacked with fury, and fought for a little time with great bravery; they were, however, &s;oon overpowered with num|bers. Allen and Gillet fell. Sadler, finding him&s;elf alone, ran acro&s;s the river, and made his e&s;cape, amid&s;t a &s;hower of balls. Whil&s;t this was pa&s;&s;ing, Oliver Am&s;den was pur&s;ued a few rods, over|taken, and &s;tabbed, after having his hands and fingers cut in pieces by endeavouring to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the enemies knives. At the &s;ame time, three chil|dren by the name of Allen, all of whom are &s;till living, were pur&s;ued; Eunice, one of the three, was &s;truck down with a tomahawk, which was &s;unk into her head, but by rea&s;on of the ha&s;te in which the enemy retreated, &s;he was left un&s;calped, and afterwards recovered. Caleb, the pre&s;ent Mr. Caleb Allen, of <HI>Deerfield,</HI> made his e&s;cape; and Samuel was taken captive, the only pri&s;oner who was taken at this time.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This lad, after a year and nine months, was re|deemed. Col. Hawks, who was &s;ent to <HI>Canada</HI> for the purpo&s;e of redeeming captives, after enquir|ing for the lad, was informed, that he was unwil|ling to be &s;een, and that he expre&s;&s;ed great di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction upon hearing of his arrival: When he was brought into the pre&s;ence of Col.

<P>It does not appear, as matter of cer|tainty, that more than one of the enemy was killed at this time, and him, by Sam|uel Allen; &s;ometime after, however, the remains of a per&s;on were found, near the

There was, at the time, much complaint, both of the people at the fort, and of the commander of that party who was with the waggons, for not affording a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which was imputed to coward|ice.

<P>The&s;e troops marched from <HI>Hatfield, May</HI> 17<HI>th,</HI> 1676, a little before night. Pa&s;&s;ing <HI>Deerfield River,</HI> at <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> they were heard by the Indian &s;entinel, who
<PB N="186" REF="039104_0183_1013C4B11F874230">
immediately alarmed the tribe, inform|ing them, that hor&s;es had pa&s;&s;ed the riv|er. Search was made, at the u&s;ual ford|ing place, which our troops had happily mi&s;&s;ed, having by mi&s;take, cro&s;&s;ed a lit|tle above, and the enemy finding no tracks, concluded, that their &s;entry had been de|ceived, and that what he heard, mu&s;t have been the noi&s;e of Moo&s;e, pa&s;&s;ing the river near the fording place. Meeting with no oppo&s;ition from this tribe, our troops marched on, till they came to the falls. It was now about the break of day. According to their wi&s;hes, our army found the enemy in an unguarded &s;ituation, without even a &s;entinel. The rea&s;on why, at this time, they were thus &s;urpri&s;ingly unguarded, was, the evening before they had been rioting upon milk, and roa&s;t beef, having been pillaging cows from the neighbouring towns. When the day opened, &s;o that our army could di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>friends</HI> from <HI>foes,</HI> they march|ed up and began the attack, by firing in|to the <HI>wigwams.</HI> The Indians awaking in &s;urpri&s;e, and in their con&s;ternation &s;up|po&s;ing that they were attacked by their native enemies, cried, <HI>Mohawks! Mo|hawks!</HI> They &s;oon, however, di&s;covered
<PB N="187" REF="039104_0184_1013C45E62CF3D58">
their mi&s;take; but being in no &s;ituation to make an immediate defence, great numbers were &s;lain upon the &s;pot,&mdash;&s;ome, in their &s;urpri&s;e, ran directly into the riv|er, and were drowned; others betook them&s;elves to their bark canoes, and hav|ing in their confu&s;ion forgot their pad|dles, were hurried down the falls, and da&s;hed again&s;t the rocks; and many who had endeavoured to &s;ecrete them&s;elves under the river bank, were di&s;covered, and &s;lain.</P>
<P>In this action the enemy, by their own confe&s;&s;ion, lo&s;t 300, women, and children included.</P>
<P>This victory, tho' great, and obtained with the lo&s;s of only one man, in the fir&s;t on&s;et, was however, di&s;a&s;trous in the i&s;&s;ue. The few who had not been &s;lain, of this tribe, after recovering from their fright, and being joined by the neighbouring tribes, di&s;covering the &s;mallne&s;s of the number, by whom they had been thus furiou&s;ly attacked, and by whom they had &s;u&s;tained &s;uch a lo&s;s, pur&s;ued, and harra&s;&s;ed the army on their re|treat, with &s;uch fury, that thirty &s;even were killed, and &s;everal were wounded.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="039104_0185_1013C4B2AC56BD10">
This lo&s;s was imputed, in part, to the bodily infirmities of Capt. Turner; and in part to the want of ammunition, which was the cau&s;e of an illtimed and unguard|ed retreat.</P>
<P>A few, to the number of about twenty, did not quit the ground, with the main body of the army, but tarried behind, for the purpo&s;e of firing at &s;ome of the ene|my who were cro&s;&s;ing the river. The&s;e men &s;oon found them&s;elves under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of di&s;puting the ground, with a con&s;iderable body of the enemy, before they could recover their hor&s;es; but af|ter a &s;evere &s;kirmi&s;h, obtained their ob|ject, and &s;oon came up with the army, which was &s;urrounded, and fought on their retreat for ten miles. Seven, or eight men, in the beginning of the retreat, were, by &s;ome accident, unfortunately &s;eparated from the army, and being un|acquainted with the ground, knew not what cour&s;e to pur&s;ue. The Indians, af|terwards, gave the following account of them: That on Monday after the fight, eight Engli&s;hmen came to them, who were lo&s;t, and offered to &s;urrender, on condition their lives might be &s;pared; but, in&s;tead of giving them quarter, they
<PB N="189" REF="039104_0186_1013C461EBFA31A8">
took and burnt them in the following manner: They fir&s;t covered them with dry thatch, then &s;et fire to it, and com|pelled them to run: When one covering was burnt off, they put on another, and &s;o continued, till death delivered them from their hands.</P>
<P>This expedition was productive of ve|ry happy con&s;equences, for the enemy were &s;o di&s;concerted in all their plans, and &s;o greatly di&s;heartened, that they never after, during that war, gave any con&s;ider|able di&s;turbance to the frontiers. From this expedition may be dated their decline in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>In the above action was one Jonathan Wells, of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> then a youth, in his 17th year, he was afterwards a gentleman improved in public life, and &s;u&s;tained a worthy character. The following is the &s;ub&s;tance of an atte&s;ted copy of an ac|count, taken from his own mouth.</P>
<P>Mr. Wells was one of the 20 men a|bovementioned, who were under a nece&s;|&s;ity of di&s;puting the ground, for the pur|po&s;e of recovering their hor&s;es. Soon after he had mounted, being in the rear, three of the enemy fired upon him; one of their balls bru&s;hed his hair, another
<PB N="190" REF="039104_0187_1013C4B89D965358">
wounded his hor&s;e, and a third &s;truck his thigh, in a place where it had before been broken with a cart wheel; the ball did not wholly break his thigh anew, but fractured the end of one of the bones, which was a little projected over the oth|er, it having been badly &s;et. Upon re|ceiving the wound, it was with difficulty that Mr. Wells kept in his &s;addle. The Indians perceiving they had wounded him, pre&s;&s;ed hard upon him. Mr. Wells recovering a little from the fir&s;t &s;hock, and perceiving the enemy almo&s;t upon him, pre&s;ented his gun, which gave them a check, and whil&s;t they were charging, he made his e&s;cape, and reached the com|pany. He repre&s;ented to Capt. Turner, the danger to which the people in the rear were expo&s;ed, and urged him to re|turn to their relief, or halt till they might come up; but he an&s;wered, "It is bet|ter to lo&s;e &s;ome, than all." The army was now divided into &s;everal companies, one pilot crying, "If you will &s;ave your lives, follow me;" and another, "If you regard your &s;afety, follow me." Mr. Wells was now following a company, who&s;e cour&s;e was towards a &s;wamp; but perceiving that a body of the enemy were
<PB N="191" REF="039104_0188_1013C464E77C46C0">
there, he left that company, who were all lo&s;t, and joined a &s;mall party, who were taking a different route; but his hor&s;e &s;oon failing by rea&s;on of his wound, and him&s;elf being much weakened by lo&s;s of blood, he was left by this party, having only one Jones, a wounded, man to ac|company him: They had no path to guide them, and were both unacquainted with the woods. They had not travel|led far, before Mr. Wells was &s;eparated from Jones, and finding him&s;elf faint, ate a nutmeg which he had in his pocket, upon which he revived. After having wandered in the woods for &s;ome time, he came upon <HI>Green River,</HI> and he followed the cour&s;e of it up, till he came to a place called the <HI>Country Farms;</HI> having pa&s;&s;ed the river he attempted to a&s;cend a moun|tain on the We&s;t &s;ide, but fainted, and fell from his hor&s;e. How long he lay in this condition he knew not, but when he recovered, he found his hor&s;e &s;tanding by him, and his bridle hanging on his hand. He aro&s;e, tied his hor&s;e, and again laid him&s;elf down; but upon reflection, find|ing him&s;elf already &s;o weak as to be una|ble to mount, concluded that he &s;hould have no farther u&s;e for his hor&s;e, and be|ing
<PB N="192" REF="039104_0189_1013C4BA22341698">
unwilling he &s;hould die at the tree, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him; but unhappily forgot to take any provi&s;ion from his portmanteau, altho' it contained a plenty. Towards night, being troubled with mu&s;quetoes, he &s;truck up a fire; but this almo&s;t proved his de&s;truction; it aro&s;e, and &s;pread with &s;uch fury, among the leaves and tra&s;h, that it was with difficulty, in his faint con|dition, he e&s;caped peri&s;hing in the flames. After he was out of danger, from the fire, he again laid him&s;elf down to re&s;t; but now new fears aro&s;e; he imagined that the fire would direct the enemy where to find him, and &s;erve to betray him into their hands:&mdash;Unwilling the enemy &s;hould be benefited by his ammunition, he ca&s;t it to as great a di&s;tance as he could, re&s;erving only a round or two for their u&s;e, &s;hould he fall into their hands. Af|ter &s;ome time, finding his fire had &s;pread con&s;iderably, he took courage, put &s;ome tow into his wounds, bound them up with his handkerchief, and compo&s;ed him|&s;elf to &s;leep. In his &s;leep he dreamed, that his grandfather came to him, and told him he was lo&s;t, and mu&s;t turn, and go down that river, till he &s;hould come to the end of a mountain, where he would
<PB N="193" REF="039104_0190_1013C467D47390B0">
find a plain, upon which he mu&s;t travel, in order to find his way home. When he awoke he found him&s;elf refre&s;hed,&mdash;his bleeding &s;topped, and his &s;trength re|cruited, and with the help of his gun as a &s;taff, he was able to walk, tho' but &s;low|ly. The ri&s;ing of the &s;un, convinced him, he was lo&s;t, and that the cour&s;e he intended to pur&s;ue was wrong. He had now wandered &s;everal miles farther from home, than when he &s;et out from the place of action. And tho,' at fir&s;t, he paid no attention to his dream, now he determined to follow the directions of it. Accordingly, he travelled down the river, found the end of the mountain, and &s;oon came to the plain; all of which, agreed to the repre&s;entation in his dream.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I doubt, whether, in this dream, there was any thing &s;upernatural, as &s;ome may be ready to &s;up|po&s;e. Mr. Wells, having wandered in the woods &s;ix or &s;even miles, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have had &s;ome doubts whether his cour&s;e was right; and his mind, when a&s;leep, would more naturally employ it&s;elf on this &s;ubject, than any other; becau&s;e, to find the way home, mu&s;t have been his great object, when awake. His dreaming, that his grandfather ap|peared to him, was nothing &s;trange;&mdash;and his lo|cal &s;ituation at this time was &s;uch, that he could not be entirely unacquainted with the natural make of the ground; and his thoughts running as they did, in this dream, would be natural; the river was near him&mdash;the plain was before him&mdash;and the end of the mountain, near the &s;ide of the plain, if he had not previou&s;ly &s;een it, would naturally be &s;up|po&s;ed.</NOTE> Soon after he entered upon the plain, he found
<PB N="194" REF="039104_0191_1013C4BC0EB8E3F0">
a foot path, which led him to the road, in which, the main body of the army return|ed. When he came to <HI>Deerfield River,</HI> he met with much difficulty in cro&s;&s;ing; the &s;tream carrying his lame leg acro&s;s the other, &s;o that &s;everal of his fir&s;t at|tempts were without effect.&mdash;Finally, however, with the help of his gun, with much difficulty he reached the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. When he had a&s;cended the bank, being greatly fatigued, he laid him&s;elf down under a walnut bu&s;h, and fell a&s;leep. When he awoke, the fir&s;t object that pre|&s;ented, was an Indian in a canoe, coming directly towards him. Mr. Wells now found him&s;elf in a very unhappy condi|tion, being &s;o di&s;abled by his wounds that he could not make his e&s;cape, and his gun being &s;o filled with gravel and &s;and, in cro&s;&s;ing the river, that he could not fight. As &s;oon however, as he perceived the Indian had di&s;covered him, he pre|&s;ented
<PB N="195" REF="039104_0192_1013C469596D3B48">
his gun, which &s;o affrighted him, that he leaped out of the canoe, leaving his own gun, and made his e&s;cape. Mr. Wells concluding that he would inform the whole tribe, who were only a few rods di&s;tant, went into a neighbouring &s;wamp, and finding two logs lying near each oth|er, and covered over with rubbi&s;h, he crept between them. He &s;oon heard the noi&s;e of Indians; but was not curious to look out after them. When the noi&s;e had cea&s;ed, he ventured to proceed for|ward. In <HI>Deerfield</HI> meadow he found &s;ome hor&s;es bones, from which he &s;crap|ed &s;ome matter, which &s;erved for food;&mdash;he al&s;o found two or three rotten beans, where the Indians had thre&s;hed, and al&s;o two Bluebird's eggs, which was all the &s;u&s;tenance he had till he reached home. He came to <HI>Deerfield</HI> town plat, on Sat|urday night about dark, but as there were no inhabitants pre&s;ent, the town having a little before been burnt, he continued his cour&s;e in the evening.</P>
<P>He was often under great di&s;courage|ments, and frequently laid him&s;elf down to die, expecting to ri&s;e no more. He reached no farther than <HI>Muddy Brook</HI> as the &s;un ro&s;e on &s;abbath morning. Here,
<PB N="196" REF="039104_0193_1013C4BF6EF32270">
&s;eeing a human head, which had been dug up by wild bea&s;ts, Mr. Wells, not|with&s;tanding the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his condi|tion, &s;toped to find the grave, which hav|ing found he laid the head to the body, and covered it with billets of wood, to defend it from the ravenous bea&s;ts of the wilderne&s;s. After he had left the brook and entered upon the plain, he grew faint and very thir&s;ty, but could obtain no wa|ter for a con&s;iderable time; he was, how|ever, often refre&s;hed, by holding his face in the &s;moke of burning knots of pine, which he frequently met with, as the woods were on fire. Mr. Wells arrived at <HI>Hatfield</HI> on the Sabbath, between meet|ings, and was received with inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, as one having ari&s;en from the dead. He endured incredible pain, and di&s;tre&s;s, with his wound, being confined &s;everal times to his bed, for &s;ix months together; and it was upwards of four years before he was &s;ound.</P>
<P>In this action was al&s;o the Rev. Mr. Atherton, mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, in <HI>Hat|field.</HI> The following is the &s;ub&s;tance of a paragraph, which he delivered to his people the Sabbath after his return:</P>

<HEAD>Hi&s;torical Sketch of Deerfield.</HEAD>
<P>THE Indian name of Deerfield was Pecomptuck. Its &s;ituation was favora|ble to the Indian mode of living; abound|ing with provi&s;ions which might be ea&s;i|ly obtained; and which were peculiarly agreeable to a people in a &s;tate of nature. It was the hunting ground for &s;everal tribes. One tribe was &s;eated on a hill half a mile N. E. of the meeting hou&s;e. Another, about two miles north of them, upon the north bank of Pecomptuck, or Deerfield river. And two or three tribes lived in the N. E. part of the town, at, or near the falls in Connecticut river.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="039104_0196_1013C4710DA4C858">
According to tradition, the&s;e tribes had frequent wars with each other, otherwi&s;e they were happy.</P>
<P>The&s;e natives were exceedingly attach|ed to their hunting and fi&s;hing grounds. When driven from the enjoyment of their privileges and natural rights, they mani|fe&s;ted a peculiar enmity to their aggre&s;|&s;ors&mdash;I &s;ay <HI>aggre&s;&s;ors,</HI> for if any, but a &s;mall part of the town was ever purcha&s;|ed of them.</P>
<P>Gladly would I throw a vail of dark|ne&s;s over &s;ome of the tran&s;actions of our forefathers, but fidelity forbids it.</P>
<P>They appear to have been almo&s;t as blind to the rights of the <HI>natives,</HI> as they were to tho&s;e of the <HI>Africans.</HI> And it can|not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that they, who ju&s;tified the en&s;laving of one heathen nation, would be backward in wre&s;ting by force lands from another. The idea was too much cheri&s;hed, that they them&s;elves were the people of God&mdash;the cho&s;en I&s;raelites, and that the natives, being heathen, were in the &s;ituation of the Canaanites, whom the Children of I&s;rael had a right, by the command of God, to extirpate. They al&s;o retained the barbarous idea, that the right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, was obtained by con|que&s;t.
<PB N="200" REF="039104_0197_1013C4C8B2E60780">
And the poor natives, not having the advantages of defence, ari&s;ing from civilization, were obliged to give way to &s;uperior force. In &s;ome in&s;tances, how|ever, lands were regularly purcha&s;ed of them.</P>
<P>It has been common to extol the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of America for their piety; and to con&s;ider them as martyrs of the cor|rupt government of Great Britain; from the tyranny of which they fled to &s;ave their lives; and to enjoy the rights of con|&s;cience. That they were in general pi|ous there is no doubt: But, they were guilty of &s;ome gro&s;s irregularities, and un|chri&s;tian conduct, altogether unaccountable.</P>
<P>Their treatment of the natives was &s;uch as frequently involved them in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es. It was natural for the Aborigines to retaliate the wrongs they received. And, probably, &s;ome part of the &s;ufferings of our forefathers, was ju&s;t.</P>
<P>When grants of land were made by the Crown or the General Court, in compen|&s;ation for &s;ervices performed, the grantees felt that they had a right to the lands and took no pains to extingui&s;h Indian titles. And, indeed, in tho&s;e times, nothing was &s;aid about Indian titles; for it was con|ceived,
<PB N="201" REF="039104_0198_1013C4742CBC8B90">
that they had no title to the lands they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This was doubtle&s;s the ca&s;e with the greate&s;t part of Deerfield.</P>
<P>In the year 1669, a grant of 8000 a|cres of land, was made by the General Court, under the admini&s;tration of Gov. Bellingham to the town of Dedham. This grant covered the lands from the mouth of Pecomptuck river to about two miles &s;outh of the mountain, called Sugar Loaf, and extended as far we&s;t as to include that number of acres.</P>
<P>The year following a di&s;pute aro&s;e be|tween the inhabitants of Hatfield, and the proprietors of Pecomptuck re&s;pecting their divi&s;ion line. To &s;ettle this di&s;pute, a committee of the General Court was appointed. The line was altered in fa|vour of Hatfield, and the proprietors re|ceived an equivalent in lands north of Pecomptuck river&mdash;extending three quar|ters of a mile north from the mouth of Green river, and about one mile ea&s;t and we&s;t.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of a petition of the pro|prietors, in the year 1673, they received a promi&s;e of the General Court, of an act
<PB N="202" REF="039104_0199_1013C4CA38A40FA0">
of incorporation, on certain conditions, and the former grant was now enlarged to a &s;quare of 7 miles.</P>
<P>From this time the town was called by the name of <HI>Deerfield.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1712, the Rev. Mr. Wil|liams entered a petition that the bounds of the town might be further enlarged, and extend as far we&s;t as to run parallel with the we&s;t line of Hatfield. The prayer of this petition was granted, and the town was extended 9 miles from the river. Pre|vious to this the proprietors might have received a grant of the north part of the town, but no record of it is to be found. It is probable that the&s;e lands were an|nexed to tho&s;e of the proprietors, at the time the act of incorporation pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;which was in the year 1682.</P>
<P>But four towns in the County had been previou&s;ly incorporated. The&s;e were, Springfield, incorporated, 1645. Had|ley, in 1661. We&s;tfield, in 1669, and Hatfield, in 1670.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t regular meeting of the pro|prietors of Pecomptuck was at Dedham, March 1&s;t, 1670,&mdash;at which, mea&s;ures were taken for laying out the town plat,
<PB N="203" REF="039104_0200_1013C4775CBCA4C8">
and the 8000 acres into regular lots. This important bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted, however, an&s;werably to the &s;implicity of the times. The town was laid out in &s;uch a loo&s;e, and irregular manner as pro|duced, immediately, and in after times many di&s;putes and quarrels.</P>
<P><HI>Deerfield,</HI> or <HI>Pecomptuck,</HI> began to be &s;ettled in the &s;pring of the year 1671. As the natives at this time appeared to be friendly, a few families erected hou&s;es up|on the main &s;treet, which was then a fore&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ettlers lived in peace with their Indian neighbours until 1675, when tho&s;e wars, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cenes commenced, which continued, mo&s;t of the time, for 90 years.</P>
<P>At this time, the famous war, called King Philip's, broke out. It was general, and extended to all the tribes in this part of America.</P>
<P>It &s;eems that the Indians began to feel the evil effects of their Engli&s;h neigh|bours; and were determined if po&s;&s;ible to de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>In Sept. this year, Deerfield was at|tacked, and one of the inhabitants was killed. The &s;ame month, when going to
<PB N="204" REF="039104_0201_1013C4D0F9DD5AC0">
the place of public wor&s;hip, on the &s;ab|bath they were again attacked; but none were killed. They perceived, however, the danger to be daily increa&s;ing, but had no apprehen&s;ion of the va&s;t body of In|dians who were then hovering around them.</P>
<P>At this time, there was a con&s;iderable quantity of provi&s;ions in the town, and it was conceived to be nece&s;&s;ary to remove them to Hatfield; although a guard had been &s;ent into the town, to protect the &s;et|tlers, under the command of Capt. Mo&s;|ley. Capt. Lathrop was &s;ent from Hat|field, with about 80 men, to guard the&s;e provi&s;ions on the way. At Muddy, ali|as, Bloody Brook, he was attacked by 7 or 8 hundred of the natives. Capt. La|throp, with 73 of his men fell in this un|happy engagement. The company at Deerfield marched with the greate&s;t ex|pedition for their relief, but were too late to &s;ave Capt. Lathrop. They fought, however, the whole body of the Indians for &s;everal hours, and were finally joined by Major Treat, with one hundred and &s;ixty friend Indians of the Mohegan tribe. This force, after a &s;evere and bloody ac|tion, di&s;per&s;ed the enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="039104_0202_1013C47AB06177B0">
Di&s;pirited by this &s;troke many of the Indians left this part of the country, and &s;ettled in the Naragan&s;etts; &s;ome, how|ever, remained, and the &s;ettlers de&s;erted their habitations.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame month, in which the&s;e mat|ters happened at Deerfield, Hadley was attacked, when the people were at meet|ing. This was the time when, according to tradition, Goff the regicide, one of king Charles' Judges, &s;uddenly made his ap|pearance, headed the troops, and di&s;per&s;|ed the enemy.</P>
<P>After Deerfield was de&s;erted, it was plundered and burnt by the natives. In the &s;pring of 1676 the fall fight happened, (&s;ee former appendix.)</P>
<P>An attempt was made to re&s;ettle the town in 1677. Very &s;oon, however, a number of the people were &s;lain. In con&s;equence of this the town was a &s;econd time de&s;erted, and all ideas of re&s;ettling it, were given up for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of 1682, the &s;ettlers re|turned; and for &s;everal years enjoyed their habitations without mole&s;tation.</P>

In this interval of peace, and but four years after the return of the inhabitants Mr. John Williams was ordained to the pa&s;toral charge of the Church.</P>
<P>It appears from the records, that the promi&s;e of an act of incorporation, and the fir&s;t grant in addition to the 8000 acres, were made on condition the inhabitants would &s;ettle a mini&s;ter within the term of three years. This, however, they could not comply with, as they were driven from their habitations; but it was attend|ed to, as &s;oon as circum&s;tances would permit.</P>
<P>In the year 1687, that part of the town, which is now Greenfield, was laid out, e&s;pecially, the home lots on Green river.</P>
<P>In 1693, the troubles of the inhabitants again commenced, and their &s;ufferings were great and uninterrupted till 1712. Every year, &s;ome of them were either Kill|ed, or captivated.</P>
<P>Hutchin&s;on, in his hi&s;tory of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts ob&s;erves, that in '97, "an attempt was made upon Deerfield by the natives, but failed of &s;ucce&s;s, through the vigilance of the inhabitants, with Mr. Williams their mini&s;ter at their head."</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="039104_0204_1013C47CA4E0F2D0">
After the commencement of Queen Ann's war, the French in Canada, joined with the natives, and encouraged them in all their wars and depredations again&s;t the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The troubles and dangers of the peo|ple were now greatly increa&s;ed.&mdash;And Deerfield was called to endure the great|e&s;t calamities.</P>
<P>A party of about 300 French and In|dians, made their appearance in Feb. 1703, 4, entered the town in the night, and while an unfaithful &s;entinel was a&s;leep, found their way upon the &s;now, over the pickets into the fort, in the centre of the town; and in a few hours &s;lew about 40 of the inhabitants; and took about 100 pri&s;oners; compri&s;ing one half of the in|habitants; and finally, as the day opened, they left the town on fire. A new meet|ing hou&s;e, with all the buildings in the town, two or three excepted, were burnt.</P>
<P>Several of the people made their e&s;|cape from the fort, after the enemy had entered it. Among whom was a Capt. Stoddard, who that night was a lodger with Mr. Williams. He leaped from his chamber window into the &s;now, with his

<P>The unhappy pri&s;oners were pu&s;hed forward into the meadow, to begin their dreary journey to Canada, in the cold and &s;now, without proper cloathing, and with|out provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Here was trouble! trouble, of which we can form but a faint idea! To par|ticularize in&s;tances of great di&s;tre&s;s, occa|&s;ioned by the&s;e &s;cenes, would be needle&s;s. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve in general, that the people were awaked out of &s;leep by the war-whoops of the &s;avages&mdash;the &s;hrieks of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and the groans of the dying. Parents now &s;aw their inno|cent babes da&s;hed in pieces before their eyes&mdash;hu&s;bands, wives, and children were torn from each others arms, to be in|&s;tantly &s;ent into eternity, or to be carried by &s;avages into the wilderne&s;s;&mdash;&s;uch as were &s;ick, and unable to walk, were &s;lain for the &s;ake of their &s;calps. All was con|fu&s;ion and terror! The &s;hrieks of wo|men&mdash;the cries of children&mdash;the groans of
<PB N="209" REF="039104_0206_1013C4840D9D7558">
the dying&mdash;and the war-whoops of the &s;avages were confu&s;edly mingled! The pri&s;oners were &s;towed into the meeting hou&s;e, while the pillage and &s;laughter were going on. But few could know what the &s;ituations of their neare&s;t con|nexions were,&mdash;whether expiring under the &s;trokes of the tomahawk, or among the pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>While the&s;e &s;cenes were pa&s;&s;ing in the centre of the town, a &s;mall fort, about 50 rods to the &s;outh was violently attacked; but the people defended them&s;elves dur|ing the night, and pre&s;erved it; other|wi&s;e, almo&s;t all the inhabitants would have been killed, or made pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Troops arriving from Hatfield &s;oon after the departure of the enemy, a battle was fought in the north meadow. They might have been pur&s;ued, and greatly harra&s;&s;ed. But it was conceived, that this would expo&s;e the pri&s;oners to imme|diate death&mdash;and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, the battle in the meadow, was not fought with much animation.</P>
<P>Many of the pri&s;oners were too weak and feeble to endure &s;uch hard&s;hips as
<PB N="210" REF="039104_0207_1013C4DCE1A0A868">
they were now called to &s;uffer:&mdash;And, when any one failed, and was unable to travel, he was &s;lain and &s;calped. This was the ca&s;e with Mr. Williams's Lady, &s;oon after &s;he left the town.</P>
<P>The&s;e pri&s;oners were 25 days on their march in this inclement &s;ea&s;on, to Sham|blee. They received, however, &s;ome a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, and many kind offices, even from the &s;avages; but their &s;ufferings were extreme.</P>
<P>What an awful &s;cene was pre&s;ented to the inhabitants who had e&s;caped, on the morning after the departure of the enemy.</P>
<P>They perceived the town &s;moaking in its ruins!&mdash;they found that their mini&s;ter&mdash;their neighbours&mdash;their hu&s;bands&mdash;their wives&mdash;and their children were driv|en away into the wilderne&s;s, by &s;avages&mdash;perhaps, never to be &s;een by them again. They mu&s;t have perceived one lying here, and another there, in the &s;treets, rolled in blood, and mangled with the tomahawk, and &s;calping knives,&mdash;and &s;ome &s;till breathing&mdash;groaning&mdash;and dy|ing!</P>
<P>Their bu&s;ine&s;s now was to gather to|gether the Indian &s;acrifice, even, an Hec|atomb
<PB N="211" REF="039104_0208_1013C485938901D0">
of mangled corp&s;es&mdash;and to &s;ear among the blood, and wounds, for &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of their connexions and friends!&mdash;But I will pa&s;s from this &s;cene of horror.&mdash;</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the pri&s;oners, who arrived at Canada, were, at different periods, re|deemed.&mdash;In the year 1706, after a &s;cene of unparalleled &s;ufferings the Rev. Mr. Williams, and 57 of the pri&s;oners were redeemed. The return of the pri&s;oners, from &s;uch a captivity excited joys, better conceived than expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Williams did not return immedi|ately upon his arrival at Bo&s;ton. And it appears, that he was in a &s;tate of doubt, whether to &s;ettle again in Deerfield. A|bout 10 days after his arrival, the town cho&s;e a committee to wait upon him at Bo&s;ton to urge his return&mdash;to take advice of the Elders of the churches upon the matter, and to petition the General Court to make him a grant, in compen&s;ation for his lo&s;&s;es, and as an encouragement to re&s;ettle.&mdash;After much deliberation Mr. Williams, concluded to return, altho' the war &s;till raged, and the inhabitants were in con&s;tant fear.</P>
<P>The following &s;ummer, &s;everal per&s;ons
<PB N="212" REF="039104_0209_1013C4DE666767D8">
were killed, and no one was &s;afe night or day, at a di&s;tance from the fort. The&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es continued until the clo&s;e of Queen Ann's war. Almo&s;t every year, &s;ome were either killed, wounded, or taken pri&s;oners, and carried to Canada.</P>
<P>From the year 1712, to 1720, the people lived in peace; from '20, to '25, their troubles were con&s;iderable:&mdash;In '25, peace was made with the natives, and no further depredations of con&s;equence were committed upon the frontiers till the year 1744.</P>
<P>In this interval of peace, in June 1729, the Rev. Mr. Williams departed this life, in the 48th year of his mini&s;try, and in the 66th of his age.</P>
<P>Mr. Williams was a man of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed piety, and of great fortitude. The &s;acrifice which he made in &s;ettling in a frontier town, when he knew he &s;hould be con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to the calamities ari&s;|ing from Indian depredations, &s;ets his character in his youth, in an amiable point of light. But a few years of his life did he enjoy the &s;weets of peace.&mdash;And his &s;hare of &s;orrows, was &s;uch, as &s;eldom falls to the lot of an individual. He had the peculiarly hard fortune to &s;ee his flour|i&s;hing
<PB N="213" REF="039104_0210_1013BE9C9898E7D0">
family torn in pieces, and one of his children da&s;hed upon the &s;tones be|fore his eyes&mdash;his dear companion drag|ed from a bed of &s;ickne&s;s, and driven out by unfeeling &s;avages, into the &s;now and &s;torms, to linger a few days, and then in cold blood to be &s;lain, and &s;calped. He &s;aw his &s;urviving children &s;cattered among the French and Indians in Canada; and every artifice u&s;ed to bring them over to the Romi&s;h faith, which would have ef|fectually prevented their return. And he ever after &s;aw one of his dear daughters, a companion of a &s;avage, and almo&s;t transformed into one her&s;elf. Such troubles this good man &s;uffered:&mdash;but he bore them with re&s;ignation.&mdash;And we tru&s;t, thro' much tribulation he has enter|ed into heaven, and is reaping the reward of a faithful &s;ervant.</P>
<P>This year the meeting hou&s;e, in which we now are, was rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>In 1732, Mr. Jonathan A&s;hley had a call to &s;ettle in the work of the mini&s;try: He accepted the call, and was ordain|ed Nov. 8th, the &s;ame year.</P>
<P>From this time until '44, our fathers enjoyed the ble&s;&s;ings of peace. At this time, the natives again renewed their dep|redations;
<PB N="214" REF="039104_0211_1013C4E8723F8E50">
and the town was at great ex|pence in building forts and mounts for defence. It &s;eems that the General Court did not afford to the inhabitants that a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, which their expo&s;ed &s;ituation re|quired; and which they had a right to expect; and that, notwith&s;tanding for three years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively they petitioned for help, &s;tating their difficulties, and great expen|&s;es.</P>
<P>The year 1745, was mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and rendered memorable, by an attack upon the people in the South meadow; in which a number of per&s;ons were &s;lain. One was left for dead, but recovered, and is &s;till living; and another was car|ried into captivity.</P>
<P>In the year 1749, danger cea&s;ed, and a committee was cho&s;en to di&s;po&s;e of the materials of which the forts were com|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>During the preceding war, the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of the people were great. They were frequently harra&s;&s;ed by the enemy. Were under the nece&s;&s;ity of lodging in picketed hou&s;es, and of labouring in the field in companies, under the protec|tion of a guard; and nights, guards were
<PB N="215" REF="039104_0212_1013C48AC4E5B538">
continually kept, and patroles walked the &s;treets.</P>
<P>In the year 1755, the people were a|gain called to build forts for defence. And in '56, it was voted that four garri&s;ons &s;hould be built. But from this time, the armies which were &s;ent to the northward, were &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful that danger decrea&s;ed; and in '58 the timbers of the&s;e forts were &s;old, altho' peace between France and England, did not take place until 1763.</P>
<P>About the year 1759, Conway and Shelburne began to be &s;ettled, and &s;oon after the out lands in Greenfield, which were, originally, a part of Deerfield.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. A&s;hley departed this life, after a long and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing illne&s;s, in the year 1780, in the 68th year of his age, and in the 48th of his mini&s;try. The &s;ame length of time with his predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Mr. A&s;hley was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;trong and di&s;cerning mind, and a lively imag|ination. He was independent in his feel|ings and conduct. He enlarged his mind by reading and &s;tudy. And was a pun|gent, and energetic preacher. He deliv|ered
<PB N="216" REF="039104_0213_1013C4E9F87D22C8">
the doctrines of grace with a <HI>pathos,</HI> which was the effect, not barely of an hi&s;|torical belief in their divine authority; but, of a deep &s;en&s;e and lively view of their excellency and power.</P>
<P>In Feb. 1787, your pre&s;ent pa&s;tor was ordained to the work of the go&s;pel Min|i&s;try.</P>
<P>In 1797, the General Court pa&s;&s;ed an Act of incorporation for an Academy in Deerfield. The following year a con|venient building was erected for the pur|po&s;e; and the Academy was opened on the fir&s;t of Jan. 1799. Since which, four hundred and &s;eventy &s;ix youths have received in&s;truction in it.</P>
<P>As to the population of Deerfield, I would ob&s;erve, that in April 1703-4, the number of &s;ouls was about 280. In the year 1763, there were, in the bounds of the original town 1105 &s;ouls: <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> in Deerfield 737, and in Greenfield 368. By the la&s;t cen&s;us, it appears, that there are now, in Deerfield, 1531.&mdash;In Con|way 2013.&mdash;In Greenfield 1256.&mdash;In Shelburne 1089, and in Gill exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e taken off from Northfield 644. The whole number of &s;ouls therefore, within
<PB N="217" REF="039104_0214_1013C492207E9E68">
the original bounds of Deerfield is 6533.</P>
<P>According to this &s;tatement, the inhab|itants doubled their numbers, in the fir&s;t period, in about 30 years. And from 1763&mdash;to the pre&s;ent time, they have doubled in nearly 15 years.</P>
<P>This &s;tatement &s;hows, in a &s;triking manner, the rapid increa&s;e of population, &s;ince the clo&s;e of the la&s;t French war; and how friendly peace, and the agricul|tural means of &s;upport, are to the in|crea&s;e of the human race. It will be &s;aid, perhaps, that many per&s;ons have come into the town &s;ince that period; this is true; but, emigrations al&s;o have been great&mdash;&s;ome years of 80, or an hundred &s;ouls.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t period, from 1703&mdash;to 1763 there was not a rapid increa&s;e; ma|ny lo&s;t their lives by the natives; and a &s;tate of fear operates in &s;ome unaccount|able way again&s;t a rapid population. Hutchin&s;on ob&s;erves that for fifty years, preceding the year 1713, the number of inhabitants in the &s;tate had not doubled.</P>
<P>One hundred years have produced a great alteration in the &s;tate of religion, and
<PB N="218" REF="039104_0215_1013C4EBBA997700">
&s;ociety. Civil liberty, a general diffu&s;ion of knowledge, and free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, have removed many &s;uper&s;titious ideas, and practices;&mdash;but the pre&s;ent generation have gone too far, and to de&s;troy &s;uper|&s;tition, and fanatici&s;m, have called in que&s;tion the great truths of revelation, and opened all the avenues of vice. In avoiding the errors of our fathers we have avoided al&s;o their virtues.</P>
<P>Many things have tran&s;pired which have had a tendency to corrupt the mor|als of &s;ociety. A great part of the time in which we were under the government of Great Britain, our governors being ap|pointed by the crown, and being foreign|ers, there was a jealou&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the different branches of government, which &s;ometimes put a total &s;top to its regular admini&s;trations. The&s;e bicker|ings tended to demoralize the people. And repeatedly the people have &s;uffered the evils of a fluctuating paper currency; which is a poi&s;on to the morals of man|kind, and one of the greate&s;t evils that can happen in &s;ociety. The war with England, and the &s;ub&s;equent pro&s;perity, together with the French revolution, have all had a very deleterious effect upon
<PB N="219" REF="039104_0216_1013C493A4EE21D0">
morals.&mdash;In addition to the&s;e things, De|i&s;ts have openly attacked Chri&s;tianity, and their arguments being plau&s;ible, have blinded the minds and injured the morals of thou&s;ands. Fal&s;e ideas of civil and re|ligious liberty have likewi&s;e prevailed, and have had a tendency to weaken the mor|al &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>But on the other hand we have &s;ome virtues which our fathers had not. We allow to all their ju&s;t rights; and have laid a&s;ide that per&s;ecuting &s;pirit which deprives others of liberty of con&s;cience. In this Commonwealth we have aboli&s;h|ed the infamous traffic in human fle&s;h.</P>
<P>When we compare our pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion with that of our ance&s;tors, we mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that our privileges far exceed theirs. The predatory war of the natives kept them in con&s;tant anxiety. This, however, had a tendency to unite them. And it is probable that they enjoyed the &s;ociety of each other, much better than we do at pre&s;ent. Common danger pro|duced mutual confidence, and &s;ympathy. In&s;tead of that coldne&s;s, indifference, and envy towards each other, which are too prevalent at the pre&s;ent day, they were cordial friends. But if we are not happy
<PB N="220" REF="039104_0217_1013C4ED5F0452A8">
under the enjoyment of peace and pro&s;|perity, the fault is our own, and it is an evidence that the enjoyment of privileges is not always productive of felicity.</P>

<P>When <HI>Deerfield</HI> was de&s;troyed in <HI>Feb|ruary</HI> 1703-4, it was in the fir&s;t year of my living at <HI>Harvard College;</HI> and I well remember how generally and greatly af|fected were the good people of this prov|ince, with that terrible di&s;a&s;ter.</P>

<BIBL>JOSHUA IV, 4&mdash;7.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Then Jo&s;hua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of I&s;rael, out of every tribe a man. And Jo&s;hua &s;aid unto them, pa&s;s over before the ark of the Lord your God into the mid&s;t of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a &s;tone upon his &s;houlder, according unto the num|ber of the tribes of the children of I&s;rael; That this may be a &s;ign among you, that when your children a&s;k their fathers in time to come, &s;aying, what mean you by the&s;e &s;tones? Then ye &s;hall an&s;wer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, when it pa&s;&s;ed over Jordan the waters of Jor|dan were cut off; and the&s;e &s;tones &s;hall be for a memorial unto the children of I&s;rael forever.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a great truth, and highly important, that the &s;ame GOD who created the univer&s;e governs it. We have the fulle&s;t evidence that divine prov|idence &s;uperintends all human affairs: and that, as GOD is the author of all the good which is enjoyed or &s;een in this world, &s;o there is no evil in the world and the LORD hath not done it. <HI>He forms the light and creates darkne&s;s, he makes peace and creates evil; the LORD does all the&s;e things.</HI> Nothing comes to pa&s;s in the world, but by the ordering or permi&s;&s;ion of divine providence. It would be well if we could always maintain a &s;en&s;e of this great truth. But it is lamentably true, that
<PB N="228" REF="039104_0224_1013C4FD8C4C29B0">
we are very apt to look only at means and in&s;tru|ments, both in mercies and judgments, and take no notice of the hand that &s;teers and conducts all things. I remember to have read a hi&s;tory of a voyage round the world, in which they who made it went through many and great perils and dangers, and were many times mo&s;t marvelou&s;ly delivered, and yet, which was a mo&s;t unpardonable omi&s;&s;ion, not the lea&s;t notice taken of GOD or providence. It is certainly our duty and wi&s;dom to be careful ob|&s;ervers of the works of divine providence. The p&s;almi&s;t, after mentioning &s;ome of the works of providence, &s;ays, <HI>Who&s;o is wi&s;e and will ob&s;erve the&s;e things, even they &s;hall under&s;tand the loving kindne&s;s of the LORD.</HI> P&s;al. 107. 43.</P>
<P>IT is profitable, not only to ob&s;erve the occur|rences of our own day, but to read hi&s;tory, and ex|amine the records of pa&s;t ages; to take notice of the dealings of divine providence toward former generations. And while we are reading, we &s;hould not forget what the Apo&s;tle &s;ays when he had been &s;peaking of GOD'S dealings towards the ancient Jews. All the&s;e things happened unto them for en&s;amples: and they are written for our admoni|tion, upon whom the ends of the world are come. 1 Cor. 10. 10.</P>
<P>GOD'S dealings with the Jews are one continu|ed &s;eries of wonders: and great care was taken in the &s;acred hi&s;tory, to tran&s;mit the knowledge of them to po&s;terity. They are not only regi&s;tered in the &s;ac|red records, but God directed that there &s;hould be &s;ome vi&s;ible &s;igns, and la&s;ting monuments erected, to perpet|uate the memory of &s;ome of his mighty acts. Thus he in&s;tituted the pa&s;&s;over, to be a memorial of the de|liverance of his people out of their Egyptian bond|age: and the LORD'S &s;upper, to be an everla&s;ting memorial of the death of CHRIST, whereby we are
<PB N="229" REF="039104_0225_1013C4A4F2D0CDE8">
delivered from bondage infinitely wor&s;e than that of Egypt. And when he divided Jordan for his people to go over and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the promi&s;|ed land, he directed that a monument of &s;tone &s;hould be erected, to be a memorial of this miracu|lous event, and to tran&s;mit the knowledge of it down to late&s;t po&s;terity, as we learn from our text.</P>
<P>PRESENT things &s;o engage our attention that we are apt to forget the pa&s;t; we therefore need &s;ome &s;igns, &s;ome vi&s;ible &s;igns, to be remembrancers to us. And it is well that they &s;hould be durable &s;igns; otherwi&s;e the knowledge of them will die, if not with the pre&s;ent, yet before many generations are pa&s;t. The children of I&s;rael therefore were direct|ed to erect a monument of &s;tone, materials which decay not with time, &s;o that if their children in af|ter ages &s;hould a&s;k their fathers, what mean you by the&s;e &s;tones, they might an&s;wer them, that the wa|ters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, when it pa&s;&s;ed over Jordan: and the&s;e &s;tones were de&s;igned to be a memorial of this event. The dividing of Jordan was a very notable miracle, and worthy to be kept in remem|brance.</P>
<P>But not only the miraculous works of GOD, but many other works of divine providence, both mer|ciful and corrective, are worthy to be had in ever|la&s;ting remembrance. There are no people but what, at one time or another, are the &s;ubjects of re|markable providence; &s;ome of remarkable judg|ments, others of &s;ignal mercies and deliverances: the&s;e ought to be carefully noticed in the time of them, and faithful annals kept of them, that &s;o children may know what GOD did, for or again&s;t their fathers in their day. And it would be well
<PB N="230" REF="039104_0226_1013C5049049F7B8">
that not only the facts them&s;elves &s;hould be regi&s;|tered, but the moral cau&s;es both of mercies and judgments traced out, as far as we are capable of under&s;tanding them.</P>
<P>And here lies the peculiar excellency of the &s;a|cred hi&s;tory. Many profane hi&s;torians give us a true and faithful account of the events which hap|pened in the times of which they wrote; and per|haps they point out truly the way and manner in, and means by which the&s;e events were brought on: but the &s;acred hi&s;tory, in addition to the&s;e, opens and explains to us the moral rea&s;ons, why the great governor of the world conferred this public ble&s;&s;|ing, or granted this &s;ignal deliverance, or vi&s;ited his people with this &s;ore judgment. It is evident to every one who reads his bible, that GOD'S pub|lic dealing with the Jews was &s;uited to their moral &s;tate. If virtue generally prevailed among them, they flouri&s;hed and were happy; if vice and wick|edne&s;s gained ground among them, they were vi&s;it|ed with judgments of one kind or another: and if one judgment was not &s;ufficient to reform them, GOD &s;ent more and heavier, and as he threatened, Levit. 26. puni&s;hed them &s;even times more for their &s;ins. When they reformed he lightened his hand; and when they proved finally incorrigible, he gave them up to utter ruin. And GOD has, I doubt not, dealt much in the &s;ame way with other nations of the world, though their hi&s;torians have been too negligent of making ob&s;ervations. They have given a faithful narration of the notable events which have happened, of the &s;ignal mercies and de|liverances received, and of the calamities &s;uffered, and of the immediate in&s;truments by which they were brought about: but, which I think to have been a very great neglect, the moral cau&s;es have not been attended to or noticed by them.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="039104_0227_1013C50615CBC1F8">
IF the moral &s;tate of pa&s;t ages had been carefully noticed, and the con&s;equent dealings of GOD with them faithfully tran&s;mitted down to po&s;terity, it would have been highly u&s;eful to us, and have had, by the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, happy influence upon our own moral conduct. When we ob&s;erved that in a cour&s;e of virtue, our fathers flouri&s;hed and were happy, it mu&s;t afford a powerful motive to their children to imitate them in their virtues and tread in their &s;teps. When we &s;aw their failings and their &s;ufferings on that account, it would naturally tend to put us upon our guard, and make us watch|ful not to &s;plit upon the &s;ame rock. When we &s;aw how quick the bright morning of pro&s;perity was &s;ometimes &s;ucceeded by a dark night of adver|&s;ity, and that hours of rejoicing were followed with days, yea months of mourning and weeping, one would &s;uppo&s;e that we could not, in a time of pro&s;|perity, flatter our&s;elves that our mountain &s;tands &s;trong, and that we &s;hall never be moved; that to|morrow &s;hall be as this day and much more abund|ant: but that we &s;hould live con&s;tantly dependent upon GOD; and that although we &s;hould rejoice in a day of pro&s;perity, yet we &s;hould rejoice as tho' we rejoiced not. When we took notice of any &s;ignal appearances of heaven for our fathers, in con|&s;equence of their application to GOD and return to him, it would afford a mighty encouragement to us, to &s;ecure an intere&s;t in his &s;pecial love and favour; to cry to him in our &s;traits; and to make our peace with him by a &s;incere repentance, &amp; thorough reformation. When we read the accounts of the &s;traits, difficulties and dangers which our fathers underwent, and took notice how they were pre|&s;erved and carried through them, and delivered from them, it would afford the be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t &s;inking and de&s;pondency in the day of trouble; it
<PB N="232" REF="039104_0228_1013C509AFAEC598">
would tend to in&s;pire us with courage and fortitude in a time of difficulty and danger. And when we took notice how, when they were ready to faint, GOD &s;upported them, and when they were in per|plexities and knew not what to do, and had their eyes unto him, he appeared, and perhaps in ways un|expected, unthought of, brought deliverance to them, and &s;urprized them with it, &s;o that they were like men that dreamed; if any thing will, I &s;hould think this would beget a firm un&s;haken tru&s;t in GOD, under the greate&s;t trials and dangers; and excite us to make GOD our refuge at all times, and repair to him, who is a pre&s;ent help in time of trouble: &s;aying as in Hab. 3, 17, 18, 19. <HI>Al|though the fig-tree &s;hall not blo&s;&s;om, neither &s;hall fruit be in the vine, though the labour of the olive &s;hall fail; and the field &s;hall yield no meat, and the flock &s;hall be cut off from the field, and there &s;hall be no herd in the &s;talls; yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the GOD of my &s;alva|tion. The LORD GOD is my &s;trength, and he will make my feet like hinds feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;tudy of hi&s;tory is very plea&s;ant. There are very few, who have not &s;ome curio&s;ity to look back into pa&s;t time, and make them&s;elves acquaint|ed with what was done before they were born. And people in general are peculiarly entertained with the hi&s;tory of their own country; they are fond of knowing their own origin, and plea&s;ed to be informed of every little incident which befell their own progenitors. We view our&s;elves as par|ticularly concerned in the events which befell our parents; and though others may take no &s;hare in them, yet children feel them&s;elves deeply intere&s;ted in them.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="039104_0229_1013C50F4DCAEDF8">
I HAVE often heard it lamented, that no more care was taken in the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this coun|try, to pre&s;erve the memory of the early tran&s;ac|tions of our forefathers, of the many hard&s;hips and difficulties they endured in this wilderne&s;s, of the perils and dangers they endured, of the &s;ignal de|liverances granted to them, and of the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing ble&s;&s;ings conferred upon them, both of a &s;pirit|ual and temporal nature. It cannot be expected that the hi&s;tory of a new and infant &s;ettlement would be filled with the accounts of &s;uch armies, battles and revolutions as are to be found in the annals of ancient &s;tates and great kingdoms. But however unentertaining a minute, particular hi&s;tory of New-England might be to &s;trangers and for|eigners, yet it <HI>would</HI> be read with plea&s;ure by us, and it <HI>might</HI> be read with profit and advantage to us. And perhaps no country of the &s;ame age has afforded more remarkables than New-England has to &s;peak of.</P>
<P>IT is now not quite one hundred and fifty &s;ix years &s;ince our fathers fir&s;t began to form a &s;ettle|ment at Plymouth. The fir&s;t &s;ettlers were puritans, di&s;&s;atisfied with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical government of the church of England, and &s;crupulous of conforming to the ceremonies which were enjoined in their wor&s;hip. For their non-conformity they were per|&s;ecuted in their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts. To e&s;cape per&s;ecution, they fir&s;t fled to Holland, and continu|ed &s;ome years at Leyden. Di&s;liking their &s;itua|tion there, they concluded to remove to America. In the &s;ummer of 1620 they &s;et out on their voyage; and on the ninth of November di&s;covered the land of Cape Cod. They had de&s;igned to form a &s;ettlement further to the &s;outhward; but being brought hither, and the winter near at hand,
<PB N="234" REF="039104_0230_1013C510D8123370">
they concluded to &s;et down here. After beating about upon the coa&s;t for divers weeks, and finding no place which &s;uited them to make a &s;ettlement in, they at length pitched upon Plymouth; and in the latter end of December they went to work to prepare &s;helter for them&s;elves, their families and goods.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;erved, as a &s;mile of heaven upon them, that contrary to their own intentions they were brought hither: had they gone further &s;outhward, as they intended, to Hud&s;on's River, the country was full of &s;avages: but here, GOD had before prepared room for them, by a &s;weeping pe&s;tilence which had depopulated the country.</P>
<P>THERE were no more than one hundred and one &s;ouls, who arrived in the harbour of Cape Cod. Winter was now &s;et in, and they were utterly un|provided with every accommodation: and no oth|er Engli&s;h &s;ettlement on the continent, than a &s;mall poor colony at Virginia; they &s;ix or &s;even hun|dred miles di&s;tant, and not able to afford them any help or relief. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, they mu&s;t have a mo&s;t di&s;mal pro&s;pect: Wherever they turned their eyes nothing but di&s;tre&s;s &s;urrounded. However, liberty of con&s;cience was, with them, the grand object: they could not enjoy it in England; and if they might only enjoy it here, it would make amends for all; they therefore engaged with cheer|fulne&s;s, in the new &s;ettlement, and underwent in|credible hard&s;hips, with fortitude; &s;oon were re|duced to great &s;traits, and within five months, one half their number were dead.</P>
<P>BESIDES the natural increa&s;e, there were from time to time, &s;ome additions made to them, by the arrival of &s;ome of their friends from England. But although the increa&s;e was but &s;mall, yet it is ob|&s;ervable, that whereas divers other attempts had
<PB N="235" REF="039104_0231_1013C5149A6E76D8">
been before made, from purely &s;ecular views, to make &s;ettlements within what was then called North Virginia, they had failed; this &s;mall colony, who were influenced by religious motives, &s;tood their ground, and were &s;lowly increa&s;ing; though greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; at &s;ometimes threatened to be cut off by the Natives, at other times greatly &s;traitened for want of bread; if I mi&s;take not, nev|er receiving any &s;upplies from Europe from the ve|ry beginning.</P>
<P>THUS things went till the year 1628; when the con&s;ul for New-England, having obtained a patent of the lands in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, &s;ent Mr. Endicot, with his wife and a &s;mall company, to be|gin a &s;ettlement at Salem. The next year, they &s;ent three &s;hips full of pa&s;&s;engers, amounting to be|tween two and three hundred; and among them four mini&s;ters: the&s;e &s;afely arrived, and took up their habitation chiefly at Salem; though &s;ome of them &s;oon removed to Charle&s;town, and with them one of the mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>IN the &s;pring of the Year 1639, there &s;ailed from England 10 or 11 &s;hips, &s;ome of them very large, filled with pa&s;&s;engers of every u&s;eful occupa|tion, with many live cattle. In this fleet, which &s;afely arrived early in the &s;ummer, were many peo|ple of &s;ub&s;tance; among whom were Governor Winthrop, Deputy Governor Dudley, and many of the patentees of the colony: and I find that Will|iam Pynchon, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> who was Trea&s;urer of the Colo|ny, and father of this town of Springfield, was one among them. Mr. Hubbard, in his hi&s;tory, &s;ays, that about this time there was &s;uch increa&s;e made, by the occa&s;ion of many hundreds who every year flocked after them, that in five or &s;ix years there were twenty con&s;iderable towns built and peopled; and many of the towns fir&s;t planted became &s;o filled
<PB N="236" REF="039104_0232_1013C519E67C37F8">
with inhabitants, that like bees they were ready to &s;warm into new plantations.</P>
<P>ONE of the &s;warms of which Mr. Hubbard &s;peaks, pitched in this town. It is &s;trange that any, in the then pre&s;ent &s;tate of the country, &s;hould be willing to be &s;eparated &s;o far from their brethren: but &s;o early as May 1635, &s;ome of the inhabitants of Roxbury, Dorche&s;ter, New-Town and Water|town prayed the General Court, (then &s;itting at New-Town, now called Cambridge) that they might have liberty to remove to Connecticut River. This was granted to them, provided they would con|tinue under their juri&s;diction. The grant is dated May 6th, 1635. In con&s;equence of this grant, the petitioners made their way, with their wives and children, into this wilderne&s;s, and laid the founda|tion of the towns of Weathersfield, Hartford, Wind|&s;or and Springfield.</P>
<P>THEY that planted them&s;elves down in this town came from Roxbury. It &s;eems there were only eight men who came at fir&s;t, one of which was the before-mentioned William Pynchon, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> a pat|tentee of the colony. They were here early in the year 1636. They entered into covenant with each other, which covenant is now upon your public rec|ords; it is dated May 14th and &s;igned by William Pynchon and &s;even others, who probably did not long continue here, as there is not, nor has been for many years, any of either of the names remaining among us. The fir&s;t article in the covenant was, that they would, as &s;oon as might be, provide a mini&s;ter to carry on the work of GOD among them. Though they were thus few in number, in the mid&s;t of the &s;avages, not an Engli&s;h inhabitant within twenty miles, and they now beginning a &s;ettlement, yet they re&s;olved not to live without the Go&s;pel; an evidence of a true chri&s;tian zeal,
<PB N="237" REF="039104_0233_1013C51CC778B840">
which does honor to them, and is worthy the atten|tion and imitation of others.</P>
<P>THEY began well, and GOD ble&s;&s;ed their be|ginnings. Some of their friends &s;oon followed them from Roxbury; and many of the progenitors of the pre&s;ent inhabitants were early here: in&s;o|much that, although at their fir&s;t &s;itting down, they did not think of having more than forty, or at farthe&s;t fifty families, yet I find by our public rec|ords, that in February 1664, there were no le&s;s than &s;eventy three male inhabitants in the town. And according to their covenant, they did early &s;upply them&s;elves with a worthy mini&s;ter, the Rev. Mr. George Moxon, who had, before he came to America, received, ordination in the church of England.</P>
<P>AT what time a church was fir&s;t gathered in the town, I cannot a&s;certain; but it appears, by your records, that Mr. Moxon was in the town in the year 1637, and continued here with his family fif|teen years, till in the year 1652; when Mr. Pyn|chon, the father of the town, having received &s;ome ill treatment from the province on account of his religious principles, he, with Capt. Smith his &s;on in law, went to England, and with them went the mini&s;ter of the town, the Rev. Mr. Moxon, never to return. This was a day of darkne&s;s with this town; I remember to have formerly heard &s;ome of the aged people, who had it from their forefathers &s;ay, that it went near to break up the &s;ettlement. But Mr. Pynchon left behind him a &s;on, who was afterward a great ble&s;&s;ing and very u&s;eful, not only here, but in the province. He lived to an advanc|ed age, was had in the highe&s;t veneration by your fathers, and remembered by &s;ome who are now living.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="039104_0234_1013C51E512A5150">
AFTER Mr. Moxon's departure, this town was de&s;titute of a &s;ettled mini&s;ter nine years. Mr. Hooker (probably he who afterwards &s;ettled at Farmington) for &s;ome time preached to the people. One Mr. Thomp&s;on al&s;o preached among them, &s;ome part of the time; &s;o that they were not for this &s;pace de&s;titute of the go&s;pel. At length Mr. Peletiah Glover a native of Dorche&s;ter, came a|mong them. I find by a note of Col. John Pyn|chon, that the fir&s;t &s;ermon he preached in the town was on July 3^d, 1659, from Jer. 4, 14. He con|tinued officiating here till 1661, when he was or|dained to the mini&s;try of the town. Mr. Hub|bard gives this character of Mr. Glover, that he was a great &s;tudent, and much given to books. He lived in great harmony with your fathers, and highly e&s;teemed, till March 29, 1692, when he gave up his charge, and the gho&s;t, and went to re&s;t.</P>
<P>IN his time that great calamity befel the town, which is the &s;pecial occa&s;ion of our a&s;&s;embling this day. From the beginning of the country, our fath|ers had much trouble from the natives. They were often threatening them, frequently commenc|ing ho&s;tilities again&s;t them, and many were killed in one place and another; and indeed it is marvel|ous that they were not all de&s;troyed. If it had not been the LORD who was on our &s;ide, now may New-England &s;ay, If it had not been the LORD who was on our &s;ide, when the Indians ro&s;e up again&s;t us; then they had &s;wallowed us up, when their wrath was kindled again&s;t us.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, it is to be ob&s;erved, that the people on Connecticut River lived in great harmony and peace with their Indian neighbours, till about the year 1675: When Philip's Indians, (this Philip was a great warrior, and a bitter enemy to the Engli&s;h; his place of re&s;idence was at Mount Hope,
<PB N="239" REF="039104_0235_1013C521F9326520">
now Bri&s;tol) and tho&s;e called Nipnets, being driv|en from the lower parts of the province, came we&s;t|ward; and after de&s;troying Brookfield, mixed them&s;elves with the Indians of this river, and &s;oon di&s;affected them to the Engli&s;h. The people of this town, and the towns above were alarmed, and began to fortify and prepare for their own defence. There were now &s;ettlements formed at We&s;tfield, Hadley, Northampton, Hatfield, Deerfield and Northfield: though all weak and e&s;pecially the two latter.</P>
<P>THE Hadley Indians fir&s;t of all, de&s;erted their fort and habitations, and joined the enemy. The Engli&s;h who were under Captains Lathrop and Bears, were &s;o incen&s;ed that they pur&s;ued them, and had a fight with them, at a place which was then, and is now called Sugar Loaf, oppo&s;ite to the town of Sunderland; wherein nine or ten of the Engli&s;h were &s;lain, and about twenty &s;ix Indians. About &s;even days after on the fir&s;t of Sept. 1675 they be|&s;et the town of Deerfield, killed one man, and laid mo&s;t of the hou&s;es in a&s;hes. Two or three days af|ter, they made an attack upon Northfield, and kill|ed nine or ten of the people; and the re&s;t hardly e&s;caped into the garri&s;oned hou&s;e. The next day, Capt. Bears with thirty &s;ix men was going to North|field to &s;ecure the garri&s;on there, when, about three miles on this &s;ide the town, he was waylaid by the enemy, and him&s;elf and about twenty of his men were killed, the re&s;t flying back to Hadley. On the eighteenth of the &s;ame month, as Capt. Lath|rop, with about eighty men, was guarding &s;everal carts, laden with corn and other goods, from Deer|field to Hadley, they were &s;uddenly attacked, and almo&s;t all cut off, not above &s;even or eight e&s;cap|ing. On the &s;pot where they were buried, at a
<PB N="240" REF="039104_0236_1013C52A1C968310">
place called Muddy-Brook, was erected a monu|ment of &s;tone, which now remains.</P>
<P>THESE things gave &s;ome alarm to the inhabitants of Springfield: though they were loath to di&s;tru&s;t their own Indians, with whom they had lived in great peace and amity for the &s;pace of near forty years. However they were not wholly unprovid|ed: they had &s;ome garri&s;ons, though I believe, not more than three in the town. The inhabitants treated with the Indians, and received from them, the firme&s;t a&s;&s;urance of their friend&s;hip: and the Indians gave &s;ome ho&s;tages as a &s;ecurity for their peaceable behaviour; which ho&s;tages were &s;ent to Hartford, there to remain. The&s;e ho&s;tages made their e&s;cape; and three hundred of Philip's Men were &s;ecretly received into the Indian fort up|on Long-Hill. Their de&s;igns again&s;t the town were revealed by a Wind&s;or Indian who&s;e name was Toto; tidings of which, were in all ha&s;te &s;ent to Springfield in the night: otherwi&s;e the inhabi|tants of the town probably had been cut off, as well as their &s;ub&s;tance de&s;troyed. The town was thrown into great con&s;ternation, by the alarming advice from Wind&s;or, and fled to their garri&s;ons for &s;afety. But two men, more unbelieving than the re&s;t, (on the morning of the 5^t^h of October, 1675, according to old &s;tile, now the 16th, this day one hundred years &s;ince) re&s;olved to go to the Indian fort&punc; and &s;ee whether the&s;e things were &s;o. They &s;et out; but had not come to Mill-River, before the Indians fired upon them, killed one on the &s;pot, and mor|tally wounded the other: However, he got back to a fort at the lower end of the &s;treet, and &s;oon died. The Indians immediately &s;et fire to the un|garri&s;oned hou&s;es, and to the barns; and on that day laid almo&s;t the whole town in a&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="039104_0237_1013C52BA2BC8460">
DEACON Burt, who was an eye witne&s;s, in a note made in the book of records, to perpetuate the memory of this melancholy event, &s;ays there were 29 dwelling hou&s;es burnt; the number of barns he does not a&s;certain. Major, afterwards Col. John Pynchon, who a few days before went to Hadley with a few &s;oldiers to take care of the people in tho&s;e parts, in a letter which he wrote 15 days after the de&s;truction of the town, to his &s;on Jo&s;eph then in England, gives a mo&s;t melancholy account of their &s;tate; he &s;ays there were about 30 or 32 dwelling hou&s;es burnt, and 25 barns full of corn and hay&punc; and that although his own dwelling hou&s;e was &s;pared, his mills and barns and out hou&s;es were all con&s;umed, with all his corn and hay; &s;o that he had nothing left for food for man or bea&s;t. This letter I have in my hands; and it breathes &s;uch a quiet, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, patient, excellent &s;pirit, that were there time, I would read the whole of it to you. Doctor Mather &s;ays, there were above 30 dwelling hou&s;es, and above 20 out hou&s;es burnt. Mr. Hub|bard &s;ays 32 hou&s;es were con&s;umed. Whether any buildings in this part of the town, except the forti|fied hou&s;es, were &s;aved, I am uncertain. Major Treat &s;oon came from We&s;tfield for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but for want of boats, could not pa&s;s the river. Ma|jor Pynchon with &s;ome forces from Hadley was with them as quick as po&s;&s;ible, but too late to &s;ave the town.</P>
<P>BESIDES the two already mentioned, there was one woman killed, and &s;everal men wounded, one of which died &s;oon after. There were &s;ome few inhabitants at Long-Meadow and I &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river; both the&s;e e&s;caped.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to &s;ee that this was a di&s;mal day with the forefathers of this town; that they were reduc|ed
<PB N="242" REF="039104_0238_1013C52D330DB7A8">
to great di&s;tre&s;s. It came upon them at a &s;ea&s;on when all the fruits of the earth were gathered in; &s;o that their year's &s;tock of provi&s;ion was con&s;um|ed, and they had little or nothing left for man or bea&s;t; and none near them had any thing to &s;pare to them. However, they did not faint: by the good providence of GOD they were carried through the winter. It was &s;aid by the ancient people, that the following winter was remarkably favorable; in|&s;omuch that they plowed their lands in the mid&s;t of winter. The town was &s;oon rebuilt and re|turned to its former &s;tate; and has never &s;ince, &s;uffered greatly by the Indians.</P>
<P>THERE was afterward a <HI>Leonard</HI> killed on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river; I &s;uppo&s;e it was the father of tho&s;e of that name who now re&s;ide there. At Pecow&s;ick were &s;ix killed, the &s;pring following the de&s;truction of the town, three outright; two wo|men with their children, who were captivated, were overtaken, and one woman with the children killed; the other woman wounded&punc; but recovered, and lived to an advanced age. And within the memory of &s;ome of you, (July 26, 1708) three per|&s;ons were killed in one hou&s;e, at Skipmug; and a fourth that was captivated was &s;oon after killed, and a lad, Benjamin Wright. Be&s;ides the&s;e, I do not know that the Indians have done any other mi&s;chief, except wounding one or two per&s;ons, and captivating a few.</P>
<P>THERE was, in the winter or &s;pring following the de&s;truction of the town, a youth of the name of Edward Stebbins, (the grandfather of &s;ome here pre&s;ent) taken captive by the Indians at Long-Meadow; which, becau&s;e it was attended with &s;ome important con&s;equences, I particularly men|tion. He was carried to the Indian headquarters, which were then at the falls in this river a few
<PB N="243" REF="039104_0239_1013C530BB8D48F8">
miles above Deerfield. This youth with another who&s;e name was Gilbert, found means to make their e&s;cape, and gave notice of the Indians place of rendezvous, and of the &s;ecurity in which they lived. Whereupon Capt. Turner, who, I take it, had the command of the &s;oldiers in the garri&s;ons, and Capt. Holyoke of this town, collecting about 150 men, partly out of the garri&s;ons and partly from among the inhabitants, went again&s;t them: and a little before break of day on the 19^t^h of May, 1676, fell upon the Indians undi&s;covered, fir|ed into their wigwams, and killed many on the place, many others in their fright plunged into the river, were carried headlong down the falls, and peri&s;hed in the waters; and many who took &s;hel|ter under the bank of the river were killed with the &s;words of our men. Mr. Hubbard &s;ays, that Capt. Holyoke killed five here with his own hand. We lo&s;t 38 men in this fight; and &s;ome of their pri&s;oners afterward owned, that they lo&s;t more than 300, &s;ome of them principal men, Sachems, and &s;ome of their be&s;t warriors. It is ob&s;erved, that they never recovered this defeat, but their ru|in immediately followed. In reward of this &s;ignal &s;ervice, a town&s;hip of land where the fight was, now called Bernard&s;ton, was granted to their po&s;|terity.</P>
<P>I cannot find that more than ten or twelve per|&s;ons have been killed by the Indians, within the limits of this town: &s;ave that Mr. Hubbard &s;ays, &s;ix or &s;even of our people, after our mills were burnt, going to a mill at We&s;tfield, and going with|out arms, three of them were killed by the enemy. I have not been able to get any account who they were, nor any further account of this matter.</P>
<P>BUT the town has laboured under other, and grievous calamities at divers times. It is a griev|ous
<PB N="244" REF="039104_0240_1013C53670AE6318">
and mortal &s;ickne&s;s which is now among us, and has put many parents into mourning. In the year 1760 and 1761, we were vi&s;ited with a &s;ore fever, which took off many u&s;eful and valuable men, in the mid&s;t of their u&s;efulne&s;s, and greatly weakened our &s;trength. But the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing time the town ever &s;aw by rea&s;on of &s;ickne&s;s, was in the year 1683, eight years after the town was burnt, (which by the ancient people of the town, was called the &s;ickly winter) when a violent fever raged in the town, to that degree that there were &s;carcely enough well to tend the &s;ick; the public wor&s;hip was for &s;ome time &s;u&s;pended, and twenty grown per&s;ons died. In the year 1711, there was al&s;o a mortal &s;ickne&s;s which in the winter &s;ea&s;on raged here, greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the people, and car|ried off a number of the principal men. It was a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing time with you in the year 1733, when your worthy Pa&s;tor, and my Rev. Father and im|mediate predece&s;&s;or, Mr. Brown, after having &s;erv|ed you in the work of the mini&s;try forty years, died, and with him a number of worthy men. Mr. Brewer was ordained your mini&s;ter May 16, 1693, and continued with you till Nov. 5^t^h, 1733, when he departed this life.</P>
<P>To him, through the providence of GOD, I, though unworthy, &s;ucceeded. The fir&s;t &s;ermon I preached was on the 26th of May, 1734. I receiv|ed ordination January 27^t^h, 1735, 6: And though exerci&s;ed with much weakne&s;s and many infirmi|ties, yet having obtained help from GOD, I con|tinue until this time. I &s;uppo&s;e, I have lived with you longer than either of my predece&s;&s;ors; and longer than any mini&s;ter in any part of the town, except the Rev. Dr. Williams, who is here pre&s;ent in the 83d year of his age, and has nearly complet|ed the 59th year of his mini&s;try; in a comfortable
<PB N="245" REF="039104_0241_1013C53A36581048">
&s;tate of health, and full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his intellectual powers, he promi&s;es to be u&s;eful for years yet to come.</P>
<P>SINCE my entrance into the mini&s;try here 476 have died, 1034 have received bapti&s;m, 298 have been admitted to full communion; there are only four, who are now living and continue with us, that were communicants at the time of my ordination. My work is near to an end: may I a&s;k your pray|ers, that I may be u&s;eful while I live, faithful to death, and then receive the crown of life.</P>
<P>THIS town is now 131 years old. The fir&s;t &s;et|tlers expected that the town would contain only 50 families at the mo&s;t: but I pre&s;ume there may be, at this day, 600 within the ancient limits of Spring|field.</P>
<P>THE town was early divided into two pari&s;hes. In June 1698, a church was gathered in the 2d par|i&s;h, and Mr. John Woodbridge ordained their Pa&s;|tor. He continued 20 years in the mini&s;try, and died in June, 1718. To him &s;ucceeded the Rev. Samuel Hopkins, who was ordained pa&s;tor June 1&s;t, 1720, and died October 6, 1755: a truly worthy man, and much beloved and e&s;teemed. On the 25th day of the following Augu&s;t, the Rev. Jo&s;eph Lathrop was ordained, pa&s;tor of that church: he &s;till lives, and has entered upon the 20th year of his mini&s;try.</P>
<P>ON Feb. 17, 1713, Long-Meadow was made a pari&s;h: on the 16th of October 1716 a church was gathered there, and the Rev. Stephen Williams was ordained their pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>ON June 24th, 1741, a church was gathered in the fourth pari&s;h in Springfield; and the Rev. No|ah Merick was ordained their pa&s;tor. He is &s;till living. This pari&s;h was made a town in the year 1763.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="039104_0242_1013C53BC33194C8">
ON Sept. 27, 1752, a church was gathered in a fifth pari&s;h in the town; and the Rev. John M'Kin|&s;try was ordained their pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>ON Nov. 10, 1762, a church was gathered in a &s;ixth pari&s;h in Springfield; and on the 17th the Rev. Silvanus Gri&s;wold was ordained their pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>ABOUT two years &s;ince, another di&s;trict was made in the town, by the name of Ludlow, which remains de&s;titute of a &s;ettled mini&s;ter. So that there are now, within the ancient limits of this town, &s;even wor&s;hiping a&s;&s;emblies, be&s;ides one who profe&s;s them|&s;elves Bapti&s;ts.</P>
<P>How greatly are we increa&s;ed beyond the ex|pectation of our forefathers? The fir&s;t &s;ettlers of the town, were they now upon earth, might with propriety adopt the language of Jacob and &s;ay, with our &s;taves pa&s;&s;ed we through this wilderne&s;s, and now we are become, not two, but &s;even bands.</P>
<P>MAY we be &s;uitably affected with all the deal|ings of divine providence towards our fathers and us, both merciful and corrective. We have mer|cies to &s;peak of as well as judgments: we have en|joyed the go&s;pel from the beginning; have had as much health as mo&s;t towns; and perhaps no town has enjoyed more internal peace, with fewer inter|ruptions, than the ancient town of Springfield. Though we have been divided into &s;everal pari&s;hes, for many years, and have had di&s;tinct intere&s;ts; yet from my earlie&s;t acquaintance with the town, your fathers looked upon one another as brethren, and regard to the public intere&s;t was the governing principle. I have ever thought it a very happy circum&s;tance, that the leading men of this town have, from time to time, been not only men of a|bility, but really friendly, both to your civil and religious intere&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="039104_0243_1013C54106D9D860">
FOR my own part, I have ever e&s;teemed it a &s;mile of Providence, that my lot was early ca&s;t in the town of Springfield; and hope I may never have occa&s;ion to change my &s;entiments. I came here in my youth, not 21 years of age; and &s;hall ever re|tain a grateful remembrance of the candor with which your fathers treated me, and many kind of|fices which they did me. But few of that genera|tion remain. They are in the grave: and I can|not forbear droping a tear at the remembrance of them. They were a worthy &s;et of people: but they are gone; and this place which has known them, &s;hall know them no more. And the chil|dren are ri&s;en up in the &s;tead of their fathers: may you, my dear people, prove your&s;elves worthy of &s;uch ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>How &s;hort is human life! How quick does one generation &s;ucceed another! there are now upon the &s;tage, &s;ome of the eighth generation of the fam|ily of the Pynchons in 139 years. My brethren, former generations are pa&s;&s;ed away, and this pre&s;ent generation mu&s;t &s;oon follow them, and make way for others. Within a few years, every &s;ingle per&s;on in this a&s;&s;embly will be in the grave. It is extreme folly in us, to &s;et our hearts upon a world we mu&s;t &s;o &s;oon leave; and it is our highe&s;t wi&s;dom to lay up trea&s;ure in heaven; and prepare for that eternal &s;tate, which &s;ucceeds this &s;hort life.</P>
<P>HOWEVER though we &s;hould not be careful of the many things of this world, to the neglect of the one thing needful, yet our pre&s;ent pro&s;perity and happine&s;s is not to be wholly overlooked. And we ought to carry our views beyond the time of our own continuance here, and confe&s;s the good and happine&s;s of tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;ucceed us on the &s;tage of life. If we regard the happine&s;s of po&s;terity, let us take care to give our children a religious educa|tion,
<PB N="248" REF="039104_0244_1013C544D4F71890">
and &s;it them to act their part well upon the theatre of the world, after we are retired to re&s;t and &s;leep with our faihers.</P>
<P>NEW-ENGLAND has &s;een days of pro&s;perity; they have al&s;o had their &s;ea&s;ons of adver&s;ity. In their troubles, they tru&s;ted in GOD, and he has re|peatedly granted them &s;ignal deliverances. Our fathers greate&s;t troubles were from the Natives, who, by the in&s;tigation of the French were often infe&s;ting our frontier &s;ettlements. And multitudes have died by their barbarous hands.</P>
<P>WHEN, by the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD upon our arms, in the la&s;t war with France, Canady was &s;ubjected to the obedience of the Crown of Great-Britain, we were ready to flatter our&s;elves that our troubles were at an end; and that now we &s;hould enjoy continual &s;un&s;hine and peace: but the clouds are &s;oon gathered again. It is now a day of darkne&s;s, not only with New-England, but the cloud has o|ver&s;pread all America: though <HI>we</HI> may expect to bear the weight of the &s;torm. Let us follow the good example of our pious progenitors: wait upon the LORD, and &s;ee to it that our ways plea&s;e him, and we may hope that he will cau&s;e the enemies of America to be at peace with us.</P>
