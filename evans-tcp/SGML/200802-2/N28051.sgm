<P>BY your &s;pecial de&s;ire have I appeared among you this day, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in paying funeral honors to our decea&s;ed illu&s;trious General GEORGE WASHINGTON! For who&s;e lo&s;s not only the Fraternity in general, with every individual member of this <HI>ancient</HI> and <HI>venerable</HI> order mu&s;t feel the mo&s;t profound grief; but for whom a NATION weeps.&mdash;A lo&s;s, of which we are &s;en&s;ible&mdash; lively &s;en&s;ible&mdash;but which to repair we are totally unable. All in our power to do, is, to recall to our minds all the <HI>good</HI> a mer|ciful GOD has be&s;towed through HIM on our Nation; and to tell <HI>our</HI> children, that they may relate to <HI>their</HI> children the imitable character of WASHINGTON THE GREAT, in whom we have found talents very <HI>rarely</HI> united, abilities only for <HI>us</HI> united: di&s;playing HIM on the re&s;plendent canopy of the &s;hining ho&s;ts of ancient and modern Sages, Legi&s;lators and Heroes to be a Star of the fir&s;t magnitude.</P>
<P>To honor with &s;olemn ceremonies the names and the lives of great national Benefactors, has, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>illiberal</HI> epi|thets of Envy and Malice, ever been deemed one of the fir&s;t du|ties; and to commemorate deeds of high de&s;ert, has been the &s;u|preme; delight of Nations. Sacred Writ furni&s;hes us with &s;ever|al

in&s;tances of the practice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2. Chron. 16, 14.</NOTE> and the propriety. The P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays: <HI>"The righteous &s;hall be in everla&s;ting remembrance."</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ps. 112, 6.</NOTE> And St. Paul enjoins it as a <HI>divine</HI> precept <HI>"to render honor to whom honor is due."</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 13.7.</NOTE> In the Book of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 44=50.</NOTE> we find the prai&s;es of more than a &s;core of Worthies recorded, among which, MOSES is one mo&s;t renowned. The Penman previous to his panegyrics made the following introduction: <Q>Let us now prai&s;e <HI>famous Men,</HI> and our Fathers that begat us. The Lord had wrought great glory by <HI>them</HI> through his great power from the beginning. Such as did bear rule in their kingdoms, men renowned for their power, giving coun&s;el by their under&s;tanding, and declaring Prophecies: <HI>Leaders of the people by their coun&s;els,</HI> and by their knowledge of learning meet for the people, <HI>wi&s;e and eloquent in their in&s;tructions.</HI> All <HI>the&s;e were honored</HI> in their generations, and were the <HI>glory</HI> of their times. They have left a <HI>name behind</HI> them that <HI>their</HI> prai&s;es might be re|ported&mdash;and <HI>their</HI> glory &s;hall <HI>not</HI> be blotted out. Their bodies are bu|ried in peace, but <HI>their name</HI> liveth for evermore&mdash;the people <HI>will</HI> tell of their wi&s;dom and the congregation <HI>will</HI> &s;hew forth their prai&s;e.</Q> And after relating the excellencies o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Enoch, Noah, Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, he mentioned Mo&s;es, &s;aying: <Q>And the Lord brought out of Jacob a merciful man, which found favor in the &s;ight of all fle&s;h, even Mo&s;es, beloved of God and Men, who&s;e <HI>memorial is ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> He made him like to the glorious &s;aints and <HI>magnified him,</HI> &s;o that his enemies &s;tood in fear of him.

He &s;anctified him in his faithfulne&s;s and meekne&s;s, and cho&s;e him out <HI>of all men.</HI> He made him to hear his voice, and brought him into the dark cloud, and gave him commandments before his face; even the law of life and knowledge, that he might teach Jacob his covenant and I&s;rael his judgments.</Q></P>

Both the memorials of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he&s;e illu&s;trious Chiefs <HI>are</HI> ble&s;&s;ed.&mdash;There is an Analogy&mdash;and, this Analogy <HI>is</HI> peculiarly &s;triking.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE &s;triking Analogy in the memorial of MOSES, the fir&s;t Conductor of the Jewi&s;h Nation, and in the memorial of Lieut. General GEORGE WASHINGTON, the fir&s;t Leader and Father of the American Nation: the <HI>One,</HI> as recorded in Sacred Writ &mdash;&mdash;the <HI>Other</HI> engraven as an evidence in the hearts of Ameri|cans in general and his Ma&s;onic Brethren in particular, is therefore our pre&s;ent theme.</P>
<P>THIS Analogy we undertake to con&s;ider:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. IN a remote manner.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. As more proximate.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. THE di&s;tant Analogy between Mo&s;es and Gen. WASHING|TON is worthy our con&s;ideration. Fir&s;t, with re&s;pect to their na|tive countries and fatality of their progenitors.</P>
<P>MOSES, born in Go&s;hen, one of the be&s;t provinces under Egyp|tian government, renowned for its fertility and richne&s;s of &s;oil; from an honorable lineage, who&s;e Ance&s;tors in a particular cov|enant with the <HI>Mo&s;t High,</HI> moved thither by invitation and divine confirmation, to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t the deva&s;tation of fa|mine, and of which family, Levi, &s;on to Patriarch Jacob, and
<PB N="6" REF="037379_0006_100CF8B39ACD1D50">
great-grand father to Mo&s;es is noted for his re&s;olution in the af|fair with Shechem.</P>
<P>GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON, born in the ci-devant Bri|ti&s;h colony of Virginia, well known for its profu&s;ion and wealth, from a re&s;pectable parentage, who emigrated from Britain, &s;up|po&s;ed not &s;o much driven by nece&s;&s;ity, like many of the fir&s;t Co|loni&s;ts, as from views to enjoy on this &s;ide the Atlantic, greater advantages both civil and religious. Be this as it will, we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that divine Providence, having once decreed for wi&s;e and happy purpo&s;es this exten&s;ive Continent to be an a&s;&s;y|lum, could in&s;pire with &s;ufficient motives and produce cau&s;es for emigration in the minds of the <HI>needy,</HI> or the <HI>wealthy,</HI> or the <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed.</HI> However, it may not be ami&s;s here to remark: that both our Conductors drew their fir&s;t breath in countries, where their Ance&s;tors fir&s;t enjoyed perfect rational liberty and every ble&s;&s;ing connected therewith, in which countries tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion did afterwards become to them in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>THIS remote Analogy we con&s;ider farther with regard to their Education. It often happens, that whom the Lord de&s;ignates for great purpo&s;es, he will have previou&s;ly fitted, and not &s;uffer him to be de&s;titute of proper means. But it may al&s;o be a&s;&s;erted, that many a man could have become more u&s;eful to him&s;elf and his country, had his natural talents properly and timely <HI>been</HI> cul|tivated, and <HI>not</HI> remained in a total &s;tate of nature by the <HI>inatten|tion</HI> or <HI>avarice</HI> of parents and guardians.&mdash;Mo&s;es, we know, re|ceived his education by a particular providence at Court, and became learned not only in all the wi&s;dom of the Egyptians and all the arts and &s;ciences peculiar to them, but al&s;o in the know|ledge of the SUPREME BEING, which made him &s;o mighty in words and fitted him to become the Deliverer of his Brethren.&mdash; Our illu&s;trious Chief al&s;o had received an education, which not only well acquainted him with the &s;ituation, extent, laws, gov|ernment, liberty and importance of his country with the advan|tages and di&s;advantages ari&s;ing from a colonial dependence on
<PB N="7" REF="037379_0007_100CF8B649765918">
Great-Britain, and which prepared him for a Warrior, a State&s;|man, and what is more, a Father of regenerated America&mdash;&mdash;but which, early and la&s;tingly impre&s;&s;ed on his mind the truth of that religion, which by a <HI>faithful</HI> ob&s;ervance of its divine precepts, <HI>"is profitable unto</HI> all <HI>things, and has the promi&s;e of the life that now is, and of that which is to come."</HI></P>
<P>THE parity of their fir&s;t heroic exploits is la&s;tly to be con&s;ider|ed in this remote analogy, which proved to be an <HI>indication</HI> of a happy i&s;&s;ue favorable to their re&s;pective Nations. Mo&s;es, at the age of forty, partly by natural affection and inclination, that he might learn the &s;tate of his Brethren and help them as occa&s;ion &s;hould offer it&s;elf; and partly by divine impul&s;e, and with de&s;ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that he might give &s;ome manife&s;tation to them, that he was rai&s;ed and &s;ent of God to deliver them, &s;mote an Egyptian, who did oppre&s;s a Hebrew, one of his Brethren. But this he did not in a <HI>malicious anger,</HI> but by his <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>&s;pecial vocation</HI> to be the RULER and DELIVERER of I&s;rael. Which call of his, how&s;oever manife&s;ted, whether by his father, as Jo&s;ephus &s;aith, or immedi|ately to him&s;elf, was evident to his <HI>own</HI> con&s;cience, and this he gave as a &s;ignal to make <HI>it</HI> evident to his Brethren, but, <HI>they under|&s;tood not.</HI>&mdash;Now, beloved Hearers and Ma&s;onic Brethren! Turn with me your minds to the environs of the Ohio, and there be|hold the fir&s;t heroic exploit of our decea&s;ed General: when not yet in the meridian of his life, and in the &s;ervice of his country, he &s;ignalized his intrepidity and &s;kill by re&s;cuing the remains of an ambu&s;hed and defeated army, headed by the <HI>unfortunate</HI> Brad|dok, when pre&s;&s;ed by the conquering &s;avages and <HI>their</HI> as &s;avage Allies. Did he not then di&s;play &s;uch military talents and cour|age in his gallant manoeuvring, as drew de&s;ervedly the attention even of OLD WARRIORS on Him, who was then in a comparative view but a Novice in the art? Was not this the <HI>earne&s;t</HI> of his bravery and heroi&s;m given to his country, which afterwards was fully di&s;played in &s;o many brilliant actions for its &s;alvation&mdash;&mdash;and which, after an elap&s;e of near a &s;core of years, was not extingui&s;h|ed from the memory of <HI>that fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly of Patriots,</HI> who con&s;ult|ed
<PB N="8" REF="037379_0008_100CF8B866FC9740">
on mea&s;ures &s;uitable to oppo&s;e the overbearing in&s;ults of proud Albion? Certainly it was!&mdash;We now advance to the &s;econd and more intere&s;ting head of our di&s;cour&s;e and con&s;ider</P>
<P N="2">II. THIS Analogy between Mo&s;es and Lieut. General WASH|INGTON, as more proximate.</P>
<P>WITHOUT pointing particularly at the exterior &s;imilitude in their &s;tatures, the one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;iderable &s;toutne&s;s of body with an augu&s;t and graceful countenance, the other appearing not le&s;s maje&s;tic in his external form and dignified in his deport|ment, we &s;hall turn to the nearer re&s;emblance of their SUBLIME CHARACTER, which here ju&s;tly takes the lead.</P>
<P>SACRED Writ informs us, that Mo&s;es, in&s;tructed in the know|ledge of the true God, grew in faith and in piety to him. Reli|gion truly exerci&s;ed and combined with natural talents, &s;hewed its benign influence over Mo&s;es. He was according to the de|&s;cription given by Je&s;us the &s;on of Sirach <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus 45.</NOTE> <HI>a merciful Man.</HI> In the orginal he is termed <HI>&aacute;ndra cl&eacute;ous,</HI> a man of a compa&s;&s;ionate, long&s;uffering, forbearing, patient, mild tempered di&s;po&s;ition&mdash; not ha&s;ty to revenge. He was <HI>calm</HI> but firm in his proceedings. His <HI>faithfulne&s;s,</HI> of which the Lord him&s;elf bore te&s;timony, was accompanied with an uncommon degree of <HI>meekne&s;s</HI>: which di&s;|played it&s;elf particularly at the time when Aaron and Miriam a&s;|&s;umed an unwarranted freedom to talk again&s;t him. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Numb. 12, 1.</NOTE> His <HI>in|tegrity</HI> in the cau&s;e and his <HI>zeal</HI> for the welfare of his brethren was &s;ufficiently evident, but above all, <HI>di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s</HI> gave an uncommon lu&s;tre to all his tran&s;actions. Before the face of the Lord could he te&s;tify again&s;t the malevolence of tho&s;e in rebell|ion with Korah, who wrongfully charged him with <HI>craving a &s;u|preme authority over the people</HI>: "LORD!" &s;aid he, <HI>"I have not tak|en one A&s;s from them, neither have I hurt one of them."</HI> This is the miniature character of the man of whom our text &s;ays: <HI>"And there aro&s;e not a prophe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ince in I&s;rael like unto Mo&s;es,"</HI> and of whom
<PB N="9" REF="037379_0009_100CF8BAE1CA4C90">
te&s;timony is born, <HI>"that the Lord hath &s;anctified him in his faithful|ne&s;s and meekne&s;s, and cho&s;e him out of</HI> ALL MEN, (e&s;pecially from out of the Jewi&s;h Nation) to be an in&s;trument in the hand of the Lord, to deliver his people from oppre&s;&s;ion and bondage.&mdash;And now, let us advert al&s;o to the character of the MAN, whom the LORD had cho&s;en out of ALL MEN to be in&s;trumental in deliver|ing the&s;e UNITED STATES OF AMERICA from a foreign oppre&s;&s;ive yoke.</P>
<P>GENERAL WASHINGTON, who had faith in God and was pi|ous. HE, well in&s;tructed in the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, clave to it with all his heart. HE was aware of the nece&s;&s;ity of divine ordinan|ces, and not carele&s;s or above u&s;ing them repeatedly in the Con|gregation of the Lord. HE <HI>was pious.</HI> Brethren of <HI>Ma&s;onic Or|der!</HI> HEARERS! <HI>"He that hath an ear among you let him hear,"</HI> un|der&s;tand and take it to heart: our ju&s;tly lamented WASHING|TON, the HERO&mdash;the LEGISLATOR&mdash;the FATHER of his Coun|try was a CHRISTIAN, and&mdash;was PIOUS!!! A rare example in the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> day&mdash;e&s;pecially among the <HI>great</HI> and the <HI>&s;trong</HI> of the earth, when pure revealed religion and the &s;acred duties enjoin|ed by it, <HI>are</HI> ridiculed and deemed as unbecoming good educa|tion&mdash;as &s;uperfluous for pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s. His pie|ty was, as it always is, the never failing fountain from which a &s;tream of other e&s;&s;ential virtues flowed: Ju&s;tice and Humanity, Temperance and Charity, Mercy and Humility, Sincerity with Uniformity, Mode&s;ty and Stedfa&s;tne&s;s <HI>were</HI> the i&s;&s;ue. He po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a mind clear and penetrating; a judgment &s;ound and &s;trong; a mien dignified and commanding; for deliberation, calmne&s;s and temper; in maturely formed re&s;olutions, firmne&s;s and per&s;everance invincible; in the execution of the great charge his country had commi&s;&s;ioned him with, &s;trict and faith|ful; acting for the pro&s;perity of America with incorruptible in|tegrity and unwearied patrioti&s;m. He was merciful in the full &s;en&s;e of the word, commi&s;erating with his fellow-&s;oldiers, &s;paring the effu&s;ion of human blood both in war and in &s;edition&mdash;for|bearing
<PB N="10" REF="037379_0010_100CF8BCA39D9590">
with his adver&s;aries&mdash;not given to revenge him&s;elf. And, who <HI>can</HI> accu&s;e him ju&s;tly of ambition, or of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, &s;o common to Conquerors? Not even Calumny it&s;elf! He avoid|ed honors <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> be&s;towed on him, rather than &s;ought them. At the return of peace he quieted the minds of the di&s;contented and the factious&mdash;&s;urrendered his authority into the hands from which he had received it; examplarily teaching a beholding world, that true greatne&s;s is found <HI>only</HI> in humility and &s;elf denial. For, the &s;atisfaction he had in the &s;atisfaction of his fellow-citi|zens with his conduct, was the greate&s;t emolument and compen|&s;ation he wi&s;hed to receive from a grateful country, for <HI>all</HI> his &s;ervices during the conte&s;t. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The greatne&s;s of his di&s;intere&s;ted mind has &s;ince his death di&s;played it&s;elf more per&s;picuous, not only to an admiring world, but to his mourning country, in a &s;ection of his la&s;t will, wherein we find that he had declined to accept of a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent, voted him by the Legi&s;lature of Virginia, in 1785, as an evidence of its approbation of the &s;ervices he had rendered the public during the revolution, amounting to the value of about &pound; 7250 &s;terling, becau&s;e incon&s;i&s;tent with a principle he had <HI>adopted</HI> and had <HI>never departed</HI> from&mdash;namely: <HI>not to receive peculiar compen&s;ation for any &s;ervices he could render his country in its arduous &s;truggle with Great Britain for its rights;</HI> and becau&s;e he had <HI>evaded &s;imilar propo&s;itions</HI> from other States in the Union&mdash;unle&s;s the &s;aid Legi&s;lature &s;hould permit him to appropriate the &s;aid intere&s;t to <HI>public u&s;es.</HI> Of which intere&s;t he has bequeathed &pound;.5000 &s;terling as a fund to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a UNIVERSITY in a central part of the United States, in order to cultivate the <HI>arts</HI> and <HI>&s;ciences,</HI> and to remove local attachments and &s;tate prejudices from our national coun|cils, which too often become pregnant with mi&s;chievous con&s;equences.</NOTE> And &s;ince, he abandoned arbi|trary power and the &s;educing principle of &s;elf intere&s;t. His ex|ample herein furni&s;hes an in&s;tructive and la&s;ting monument to all, who in future &s;hall be called to the command of our army, or fill the pre&s;idential chair. In the humble and endearing &s;cenes of private life, he was not le&s;s imitable: He was conde&s;cending to his equals&mdash;kind to his inferiors&mdash;tender to her, who was the partner of his love; in &s;hort, his public virtues were illuminat|ed by the beams of his private character.</P>
<P>THESE characteri&s;tic qualities as an effluxion from piety, were <HI>not</HI> be&s;towed and &s;upported by the gracious Father of lights to remain unemployed. For, God who gives to &s;ome men an un|common
<PB N="11" REF="037379_0011_100CF8C075DC5868">
&s;hare of talents, al&s;o makes opportunity for their di&s;|play to HIS glory and the common good. As it was with the De|liverer of I&s;rael, &s;o we find it to be the ca&s;e with the Deliverer of America. And this leads us next to con&s;ider: This proximate analogy in their official actions, whereby they were &s;ignalized and made glorious.</P>
<P>THE &s;on of Sirach's Eulogy on Mo&s;es enumerates &s;everal, and &s;ome can mo&s;t ea&s;ily be applied to <HI>our illu&s;trious Chief</HI> by the weak|e&s;t capacity. Time and &s;ea&s;on will not permit us to dwell on the&s;e intere&s;ting &s;ubjects, therefore we &s;hall only remark on them as in pa&s;&s;ing by. On the whole we have to &s;tate, that the&s;e of|ficial great actions of Mo&s;es, <HI>were,</HI> according to &s;acred record, the effect of his Faith in God, and in the &s;urety of his vocation and appointment from God, who, not without <HI>great rea&s;on</HI> had revealed him&s;elf to him, as the God of Abraham, of I&s;aac and of Jacob. Which faith under many and great oppo&s;itions was va|riou&s;ly exerci&s;ed in obedience to this God, by the u&s;e of the pre&s;cribed means, which, though &s;eemingly weak and inade|quate for carnal rea&s;on, were neverthele&s;s &s;ufficient for the com|pletion of the divine purpo&s;es. Now, as the deliverance of I&s;|rael <HI>through Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;o was the deliverance of America, an act of <HI>faith</HI> accompanied with the prudent u&s;e of means, in <HI>our</HI> belov|ed GENERAL, whereby he in the cour&s;e of our revolutionary war, by being frequently placed in the mo&s;t perplexed &s;ituation and embarra&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances&mdash;betrayed by &s;ome and de&s;erted by others; expo&s;ed to every difficulty originating from &s;canty re&s;ources, unequipped and undi&s;ciplined troops and a formida|ble foe; yet, with a great and un&s;haken mind &s;urmounting the whole, was magnified and made glorious. We &s;hall, in repre|&s;enting this &s;triking &s;imilarity, only <HI>touch</HI> facts.</P>
<P>THE Lord, &s;aid the &s;on of Sirach, magnified Mo&s;es, &s;o, that his enemies &s;tood in fear of him. The Lord al&s;o magnified his &s;ervant WASHINGTON in the &s;ame manner. <HI>The heights near Bo&s;|ton,</HI> where his pre&s;ence in&s;pired firmne&s;s to an undi&s;ciplined
<PB N="12" REF="037379_0012_100CF8C2B3B866F8">
courageous Yeomanry, <HI>are witne&s;&s;es</HI>&mdash;THERE he kept a powerful and well provided enemy in awe. Long-I&s;land, York-I&s;land and New-Jer&s;ey, can bear te&s;timony, where he was engaged with &s;uperior and well di&s;ciplined armies; where he, but with a handful of brave Warriors, checked formidable ho&s;tile legions, conducted by an experienced chief. Who remembers not his pre&s;ence having been a terror to his enemies almo&s;t every where? The environs of Brandywine, the fields of Germantown, the hills of Whitemar&s;h, the camp at Valley-Forge and the plains of Monmouth can give &s;atisfactory evidence. And, as Mo&s;es was magnified by the Lord in conducting the ho&s;t of I&s;rael through the Red Sea, (under no &s;mall exerci&s;e of Faith) in a dreadful &s;tormy night, thereby forwarding the utter de&s;truction of his en|emies, who &s;ecurely followed them; &s;o was General WASHING|TON in conducting our thinned, worn down and almo&s;t di&s;pirit|ed remnant of patriots, under cover of a dreadful, &s;tormy, win|try night over the Delaware, which, furiou&s;ly floating with ice forbade human approach, into the fields of Trenton, there and in the plains of Princetown conquering and pur&s;uing a &s;ecure en|emy and opening to America <HI>the road to Fortune.</HI> He, who had commanded Mo&s;es at the Red Sea, had al&s;o in&s;pired WASHING|TON on the banks of the Delaware with this memorable manoeu|vre, and&mdash;GAVE HIM SUCCESS.</P>
<P>We read further: that Mo&s;es by his words cau&s;ed wonders to cea&s;e. The 8th, 9th and 10th Chapters of Exodus inform us, that the&s;e words were cries and intreaties to the Lord to be mer|ciful, <HI>even</HI> to his enemies. Now, can it readily be &s;uppo&s;ed that General WASHINGTON, who knew his own and his country's critical &s;ituation&mdash;who loved religion and his country&mdash;who as a Chri&s;tian knew his privilege and the command to exerci&s;e it&mdash; who, at the ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities after an eight years &s;truggle with oppre&s;&s;ion, i&s;&s;ued his general orders to the Army "to ren|der thanks to Almighty God for all his mercies, particularly for his overruling <HI>the wrath of Men to his own glory</HI> and cau&s;ing the rage of war to cea&s;e among the nations," omitted prayer?&mdash;That
<PB N="13" REF="037379_0013_100CF8C44F9B4510">
him&s;elf &s;hould not have addre&s;&s;ed the Throne of grace, to turn the hearts of his country's enemies and incline them to peace, and to grant &s;uch other ble&s;&s;ings at the reception of which his rejoicing heart felt the warme&s;t gratitude?&mdash;No, it cannot rea|&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed. An unnece&s;&s;ary or una&s;ked-for gift lays proud human nature not ea&s;ily under great and open acknow|ledgments to the <HI>giver.</HI></P>
<P>WE are further informed, that the LORD made Mo&s;es glori|ous in the &s;ight of Kings, <HI>Five</HI> which were conquered, are men|tioned particularly: The Kings of Egypt and of Ba&s;han&mdash;the Kings of the Amalekites, the Amonites and the Midianites. The great fame of our venerable Chief not only reached di&s;tant nations of Indians in America, but &s;lew acro&s;s the Atlantic, and we know he did become glorious in the &s;ight of Kings and Prin|ces, partly by victories <HI>over</HI>&mdash;or by treaties <HI>with</HI> them.</P>
<P>WE al&s;o read, that Mo&s;es e&s;tabli&s;hed laws and &s;tatutes in I&s;|rael, that his nation might know the covenant with God and his judgments.&mdash;And, that he on the re&s;ignation of his Office and before he went to &s;leep with his fathers, &s;hewed I&s;rael their true intere&s;t in &s;etting before them life and death, good and evil, in either wor&s;hipping or abandoning that God, who with &s;uch a powerful arm had delivered and brought them &s;o nigh the enjoy|ment of their temporal felicity, clo&s;ing his farewell addre&s;s with exhorting them, <HI>to &s;et their hearts unto all the words of his te&s;timony.</HI> Now, that our WASHINGTON was not only a Hero and a Con|queror, but the Sage, the Legi&s;lator, the Advi&s;er, the Admon|i&s;her and the Father of his Country, will, I hope, never be for|gotten by our late&s;t po&s;terity. Did he not like unto Mo&s;es, be|fore he quitted the Pre&s;idential chair, make his nation, his chil|dren, the people of the&s;e States acquainted with their true &s;itua|tion, intere&s;t and duty? Read his Beque&s;t to the nation!&mdash; Meditate on his Legacy!&mdash;Let your children &s;tudy it in their &s;chools, &s;eminaries and univer&s;ities!&mdash;Did he not therein in the
<PB N="14" REF="037379_0014_100CF8C60C933918">
mo&s;t forcible manner inculcate real religion as the ba&s;is of all pro&s;perity&mdash;&mdash;that religion of which his great heart was fully per|&s;uaded and therewith embelli&s;hed, I mean the religion of JESUS CHRIST? Permit me a &s;mall quotation; let it &s;ink deep into your hearts as the words of a dying father! <Q>Of all the di&s;po|&s;itions and habits which lead to political pro&s;perity, RELI|GION and MORALITY ARE INDISPENSABLE SUPPORTS. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patrioti&s;m, who &s;hould labor to &s;ubvert the&s;e great pillars of human happine&s;s, the firme&s;t props of the duties of Men and Citizens. The <HI>mere</HI> Politician, equally with the <HI>pious</HI> Man ought to re&s;pect and to cheri&s;h them. A volume could not trace all their connec|tions with private and public felicity. Let it be &s;imply a&s;ked: where is the &s;ecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if the &s;en&s;e of religious obligation <HI>de&s;ert</HI> the oaths, which are the in&s;truments of inve&s;tigation in Courts of Ju&s;tice? And let us with <HI>caution</HI> indulge the &s;uppo&s;ition, that morality can be maintained <HI>without</HI> religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar &s;tructure; rea&s;on and experience both forbid us to expect that <HI>national morality can prevail in exclu&s;ion of religious principle."</HI></Q> The whole of this valuable Legacy of good advice, which he had bequeathed on his departure from public life&mdash;the re&s;ult of long experience, and expre&s;&s;ed in the language of firmne&s;s and paternal affection, &s;hould, as we have no doubt it will, be en|graven deeply on the minds of his fellow-citizens, and tran&s;mitt|ed with their &s;anctioning approbation to their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THE third and la&s;t proximate Analogy between our two He|roes con&s;i&s;ts in the high e&s;timation in which both were held. Our &s;ublime writer &s;aith: Mo&s;es was beloved of God and Men.</P>
<P>THE LORD evinced his high love and e&s;teem for Mo&s;es: in choo&s;ing <HI>him</HI> out of ALL Men to be his &s;ervant and inve&s;ting <HI>him</HI> for the conduct of his people with &s;uch high authority and power; in admitting <HI>him</HI> as a Mediator between HIMSELF and
<PB N="15" REF="037379_0015_100CF8C83A61F410">
the people and granting <HI>his</HI> interce&s;&s;ions; in exalting <HI>him</HI> before his enemies; in protecting <HI>him</HI> again&s;t the rebellious clamors of mutineering clubs; <HI>in making</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>like to the glorious &s;aints;</HI> developing HIMSELF to <HI>him</HI>; &s;hewing <HI>him</HI> part of HIS glory, at the burning bu&s;h and on the mount in the dark cloud; making <HI>him</HI> to hear and to under&s;tand HIS voice; &s;peaking to <HI>him</HI> face to face and revealing HIS GREAT and TERRIBLE NAME to <HI>him.</HI> &mdash;What he <HI>there</HI> &s;aw, heard, under&s;tood, and foreta&s;ted is inex|pre&s;&s;ible, but can I pre&s;ume, without further explanation be &s;ufficiently under&s;tood by &s;uch of my audience, who really have come from natural darkne&s;s to the divine light; who have been admitted to behold the &s;ublime my&s;teries in the <HI>inner</HI> Courts; and who, as humble, chri&s;tian-minded, exalted, well-informed and genuine Brethren can be&s;t under&s;tand and there|of partake.</P>
<P>THE Lord evinced his great regard further for Mo&s;es: for in the la&s;t moments of his life he &s;uffered him not to langui&s;h un|der a long preceeding illne&s;s, but on the &s;ure and irrevocable notice of his approaching di&s;&s;olution, he, in the clo&s;e intimacy exi&s;ting between his God and him&s;elf, &s;urrendered with calm re&s;ignation his &s;oul into the kind and powerful hands of his Cre|ator.&mdash;And what is more extraordinary: the LORD him&s;elf bu|ried Mo&s;es, and his &s;epulchre was never di&s;covered by any Man. Thus loved and e&s;teemed the Lord his &s;ervant Mo&s;es! And thus did the Lord &s;ignalize in &s;ome degree the decea&s;ed General, our illu&s;trious Chief. He had found grace before HIM&mdash;HE cho&s;e <HI>him</HI> out of the tribes of America, to become its political Saviour&mdash;&mdash;HE endowed <HI>him</HI> with the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and the love of piety; HE enabled <HI>him</HI> with that circum&s;pection of conduct, that dignity of character and maje&s;tic glory, for which he is &s;o univer&s;ally famed; He clothed <HI>him</HI> with authority and power; He exalted <HI>him</HI> before, and protected <HI>him</HI> again&s;t the &s;nares, the plots, the calumnies, the hidden de&s;igns of his avow|ed and &s;ecret enemies; HE made <HI>him</HI> become acquainted with the LAW OF LIFE AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS GREAT
<PB N="16" REF="037379_0016_100CDA2B8AF86150">
AND TERRIBLE NAME; HE al&s;o favored <HI>him</HI> with a &s;hort &s;ickne&s;s, and, painful as it was, he was &s;trengthened therein not to utter a &s;igh or a groan, but with undi&s;turbed &s;erenity render|ed his &s;pirit to HIM who gave it exi&s;tence, and which, as we have ground to believe, was received in the man&s;ions of peace. Thus he clo&s;ed his cour&s;e&mdash;forty-five years whereof were well &s;pent in his country's &s;ervice&mdash;for which the Lord cau&s;ed his Memory to be exceedingly venerated in his death. His Sepul|chre is known to us and will be to our po&s;terity: not to idolize, but to remember and imitate him in all his public and private virtues, and to ca&s;t into oblivion all foibles and errors incident to human nature.</P>
<P>MOSES was al&s;o beloved of men. Though there were among the ho&s;t of I&s;rael &s;ome, who always murmured and found fault with him, yet the nation at large entertained the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of e&s;teem for him, which it evinced after his decea&s;e by in&s;tituting a &s;olemn and public mourning for him for THIRTY days. Jews, Mahometans and Chri&s;tians to this day look jointly on him with reverence as a Sage, a Legi&s;lator, an intimate Friend of the MOST-HIGH, and as an in&s;trument of God to impart <HI>Wi&s;dom and Truth</HI> to an idolatrous and ignorant world. With re&s;pect to our <HI>venerable Chief,</HI> who was fir&s;t in war, fir&s;t in peace, and who&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Memorial is deeply engraven in the hearts of all <HI>true</HI> Americans in general, and his Ma&s;onic Brethren in particu|lar&mdash;notwith&s;tanding the reiterated grumblings of a &s;et of men, actuated by the &s;pirit of Korah, Dathan and Abiram; who being even jealous and fearful of their own &s;hadow, are con&s;tantly re|pining and di&s;plea&s;ed with every mea&s;ure tending to good order and government either in Church or State. Which contempo|rary with <HI>him</HI> all around this inhabitable globe, who has &s;een or heard of the graceful gifts, extraordinary talents and the humble exerci&s;e of them, that does not entertain a favorable idea of <HI>him</HI> and admires <HI>him</HI> as a wi&s;ely cho&s;en in&s;trument in the hands of an all ruling providence to be&s;tow ble&s;&s;ings on the American Na|tion?

<P>WITH regard to the di&s;charge of our &s;econd duty which we owe to our Country: let us not only keep in con&s;tant memory the patriotic and really excellent advice contained in the fare|well-addre&s;s cited above, but al&s;o endeavour punctually to follow the &s;ame.

Let us carefully beware of foreign gods, foreign influ|ence, and foreign luxury and depravity, as &s;ure means to de&s;troy a nation.
