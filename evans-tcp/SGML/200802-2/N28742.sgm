<P>THE Inhabitants of this re&s;pectable town having, through you, re|que&s;ted for publication a copy of the Di&s;cour&s;e I delivered on the 29th of December, being the Sabbath after the melancholy news of the death of General WASHINGTON reached us, I &s;ubmit to their candour the enclo&s;ed pages, which contain the principal part of it.</P>
<P>As the Di&s;cour&s;e was written without the lea&s;t expectation of its appearing in print, and was not &s;olely appropriated to the event, I have, in copying, omitted &s;ome parts, which are wholly irrelevant to the de&s;ign of the town in bringing into public view the occa&s;ional di&s;|cour&s;es delivered in it on that day.</P>

<P>And the angel, which I &s;aw &s;tand upon the &s;ea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and &s;ware by him that liveth forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that therein are, and the earth and the things that therein are, and the &s;ea and the things which are therein, <HI>THAT THERE SHOULD BE TIME NO LONGER.</HI></P></Q>

<P>****CONSIDERING the end for which man is made and placed in this world, the condition of his pre&s;ent life, and his connexion with a future &s;tate, it is of the utmo&s;t importance to him to make a right e&s;timate, and good improvement, of his time. It is in this life he mu&s;t take a right direc|tion, if he would make a happy progre&s;s through
<PB N="4" REF="038323_0004_1011A116D530C248">
eternity. It is here he mu&s;t begin to live <HI>well,</HI> if he would live hereafter in the enjoyment of im|mortality. As he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily look forward to that period when "time &s;hall be no longer," when the revolutions of the earth, which now mea&s;ure off his exi&s;tence in &s;tated and regular portions, &s;hall cea&s;e, and days and nights, months and years, &s;hall be done away, it becomes him, while they la&s;t, dili|gently to u&s;e them to the great end for which they are given&mdash;to prepare for eternity.</P>
<P>If man were to live here forever, his life pa&s;&s;ing on continually, without the interruption of death, it would be <HI>wi&s;e</HI> in him to make a right and dili|gent u&s;e of his time; becau&s;e wi&s;dom, which is the true glory of man, con&s;i&s;ts in u&s;ing every thing to the be&s;t end; and this, as it re&s;pects the life of man, is in doing that which gives him the greate&s;t dignity and happine&s;s. The rever&s;e of this is folly. For he who mi&s;u&s;es his time, &s;pending it in the pur&s;uits of vice, only accumulates to him&s;elf a load of mi&s;ery, which makes life unplea&s;ant and burden|&s;ome, if not unde&s;irable. And he who &s;pends his time in idlene&s;s, without much employment in actions either good or bad, &s;uffers a di&s;ea&s;e to grow
<PB N="5" REF="038323_0005_1011A1189C1646F0">
upon him, which will finally make him in capable of enjoyment, fill him with unea&s;ine&s;s, and render his exi&s;tence mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Man was made for action; and he cannot tran&s;gre&s;s this law of his nature without injuring him&s;elf. He was ordained to &s;eek and find hap|pine&s;s in a cour&s;e of good actions. He ought not therefore to expect to find it in idlene&s;s, or the pur&s;uits of vice. He mu&s;t be active, but he mu&s;t al&s;o be virtuous; otherwi&s;e he perverts the end of his being, which leads to mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>If it be true, that, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, virtue generally tends to happine&s;s, and vice to mi&s;ery, it is al&s;o true&punc; that our good or bad conduct will produce much more enjoyment and &s;uffering in the future; for this is a &s;tate of probation and trial to mankind; the other is to be a &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, in which men are to receive ac|cording to the deeds done in the body.</P>
<P>Though, in general, happine&s;s re&s;ults from good actions, and mi&s;ery from bad, in this life, yet it is not uniformly the ca&s;e. Good men are &s;ometimes permitted to &s;uffer, even for the exerci&s;e of virtue; and the wicked are allow|ed
<PB N="6" REF="038323_0006_1011A11B2A236638">
to triumph, and to enjoy for a while the har|ve&s;t they reap in the field of iniquity. It is by pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity God tries men here; but we are cautioned again&s;t being overcome by the&s;e trials, and exhorted to look to the end. We are neither to be frighted from the path of duty by the &s;ufferings of the virtuous, nor decoyed from it by the temporary pro&s;perity of the wicked. Mankind, in all their actions, &s;hould look forward to the fu|ture &s;tate, where virtue will be highly rewarded, and vice &s;everely puni&s;hed; and con&s;ider what ef|fect their actions will have upon their future, rather than on their pre&s;ent life. If the practice of god|line&s;s be not always profitable to the righteous in giving them the good things of this life, it will give them, in adver&s;ity, that con&s;olation and hope which are better than the gains of ungodline&s;s; and it will finally give them the ine&s;timable trea|&s;ures of heaven. For the Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us, that in "the day of the righteous judgment of God, he will render to every man according to his deeds: to them who, by patient continuance in well doing, &s;eek for glory, honour, and immortality, he will give eternal life; but unto them that are conten|tious,
<PB N="7" REF="038323_0007_1011A11EC15D5D80">
and do not obey the truth, but obey unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s, he will render indignation and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h, upon every &s;oul of man that doth evil." Seeing, then, that as the con|duct of men has been here, &s;o will their condition be hereafter, it is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould be diligent in u&s;ing our time <HI>well</HI>; &s;pending it in the faithful di&s;charge of our duty; making the mo&s;t we can of the &s;hort term of life now allotted us, by em|ploying it in good and virtuous actions.</P>
<P>I do not mean to a&s;&s;ert, that every moment of our time, not nece&s;&s;arily employed in taking the refre&s;hment of animal nature, mu&s;t be devoted to bodily action. There are mental as well as cor|poreal employments belonging to the duty of man. The mind mu&s;t be refre&s;hed, as well as the body: it mu&s;t have its food and its exerci&s;e; and our wi&s;dom is to be &s;hewn in the proper di&s;tribution of time between &s;tudy and labour, thinking and acting. As animal beings, we mu&s;t provide for the &s;upport and comfort of the body: but as ra|tional beings, our principal care mu&s;t be to pro|mote the improvement and happine&s;s of the mind. Our cares for the former &s;hould be &s;ub&s;ervient to
<PB N="8" REF="038323_0008_1011A12140547130">
tho&s;e for the latter. The body is the vehicle in which the &s;oul acts, and through which it re|ceives many plea&s;ures; but mere &s;en&s;ual enjoy|ments are of the lower kind, and our animal is the lea&s;t valuable part of our nature. We ought duly to prize every enjoyment God has given us; but we &s;hould prefer tho&s;e of the noble&s;t kind, and on which he has &s;tamped the greate&s;t value. What &s;hall a man profit if he gain the whole world of &s;en|&s;ual plea&s;ures, and lo&s;e all the exqui&s;ite delights which belong to the &s;oul&mdash;all that pure and refin|ed happine&s;s an intelligent being is capable of en|joying? A part of our time, therefore, ought to be appropriated to <HI>thinking</HI> and <HI>reflecting</HI>; for without this we cannot improve the mind, lead a rational life, nor an&s;wer the principal end of our being.</P>
<P>He who reflects properly on his nature and con|dition, mu&s;t &s;oon perceive, that the intention of his Creator in placing him here, was not merely that he might enjoy the &s;en&s;ual or &s;ocial plea&s;ures of the pre&s;ent life. His views and expectations are nece&s;&s;arily carried forward to another &s;tate: his hopes and fears connect him with it, and he feels
<PB N="9" REF="038323_0009_1011A1240D87AB38">
him&s;elf bound to act with reference to it. Reve|lation teaches him to contemplate the future &s;tate of immortality as a <HI>&s;piritual &s;tate</HI> of purity and ho|line&s;s; full of wi&s;dom and love, as well as of un|&s;peakable happine&s;s. He will therefore &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of a diligent improvement of his time, to become qualified to enjoy it. In many things it is the contra&s;t of our pre&s;ent condition: and if we would obtain the qualifications for it, we mu&s;t oppo&s;e every thing in our&s;elves we per|ceive contrary to it. We &s;hall find we have much to do in <HI>time</HI> to prepare for <HI>eternity.</HI> We have the evil propen&s;ities of our nature to re&s;train and &s;ubdue, the pa&s;&s;ions to control and regulate, &s;in to mortify and conquer. We have knowledge to acquire, of our duty, of the be&s;t manner of re&s;i&s;t|ing and overcoming temptations, and of perform|ing good and virtuous actions. We mu&s;t <HI>watch</HI> with vigilance, and <HI>pray</HI> with fervency, that we be not overcome by our &s;piritual enemies. We have many and various talents to improve; and time, which is not the lea&s;t important talent, em|braces all the others. How many duties have we to di&s;charge which re&s;pect our&s;elves! how many
<PB N="10" REF="038323_0010_1011A125978B5FD0">
&s;ocial duties which regard others! We have much to learn and practi&s;e, if we would "abound in the work of the Lord." And, though we have the grace of God to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in this chri&s;tian cour&s;e and warfare, we need to u&s;e great diligence to make progre&s;&s;ive improvement in it. Our pa&s;&s;ions will &s;ometimes get the advantage over our rea&s;on and judgment, and a &s;en&s;e of our duty&mdash;impede our progre&s;s towards heaven, and throw us back upon the world. It requires every aid of exertion, cir|cum&s;pection, diligence and firmne&s;s, "to per&s;evere in the ways of well doing"&mdash;to lead that life of piety and virtue which will fit us for the enjoy|ment of immortality.</P>
<P>I mean not to &s;ugge&s;t, that we can <HI>merit</HI> eternal life by our own works. This is the free gift of God to men through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But he has not promi&s;ed it to any who continue in di&s;obedi|ence, who &s;pend their time in idlene&s;s, or employ it in the works of iniquity. He requires the qua|lification of holine&s;s to fit us for it. "Ye &s;hall be holy," &s;ays he, "for I am holy;" and, "with|out holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord." By the u&s;e of the means of grace, God has appointed, we
<PB N="11" REF="038323_0011_1011A12A1DF9B0D8">
may become holy; but we mu&s;t be diligent in the u&s;e of them, to make progre&s;s in a holy life.****</P>
<P>Enough has been &s;aid to &s;hew the importance of time to us, and the nece&s;&s;ity of making a right u&s;e of it, that we may be prepared for that final, though uncertain, period when time &s;hall cea&s;e, and eternity, as it re&s;pects us, begin; and when all, who &s;hall be counted worthy to obtain the gift, &s;hall enter upon the enjoyment, of eternal life.</P>
<P>I have been led to this &s;ubject, my hearers, by that tran&s;ition of time which has brought us near the clo&s;e of the pre&s;ent year. At the end of two days it will be no more. Another year of our lives will have rolled away, and brought us nearer to that important period "when time will be no longer;" when the apparent revolutions of the &s;un, and other heavenly bodies, &s;hall no longer divide the portions of our exi&s;tence. For then the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of this world will end. "The heavens &s;hall pa&s;s away with a great noi&s;e, and the elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat; the earth al&s;o, and the works that are therein, &s;hall be burnt up." The mea&s;urers of time will no longer per|form
<PB N="12" REF="038323_0012_1011A12BA61D2FD8">
this office: the revolutions by which our years have been determined will then cea&s;e: the pre&s;ent beautiful &s;cene of nature, and all the works and monuments of human labour, art, and ingenu|ity, will be gone. But the &s;oul of the good, the righteous man, &s;hall remain unhurt, amid&s;t this di&s;&s;olution of nature, this "wreck of matter, and this cru&s;h of worlds." He is taught to look for, and expect from the Lord, "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s. Where|fore, beloved," &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, "&s;eeing that ye look for &s;uch things, be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace:" be diligent in the im|provement of the pre&s;ent time, that ye may be prepared for that great event. And let us, my hearers, reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on this truth, that we know not the time when this decree of the Al|mighty, pronounced by his angel, &s;hall be fulfilled. As it re&s;pects our&s;elves it cannot be farther di&s;tant than the remainder of our lives: for, when death clo&s;es the pre&s;ent &s;cene of our exi&s;tence, to us "time will be no longer." And who can count with certainty upon a future hour? Let us then improve the pre&s;ent time in the important duties
<PB N="13" REF="038323_0013_1011A12D5F256380">
of life, to &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings of eternity. As one mean of improvement, as a &s;timulus to diligence and activity, let us reflect on the year that is pa&s;t; and, while the &s;cenes of it are fre&s;h in our minds, &s;elect from them that u&s;eful in&s;truction they afford.</P>
<P>In this, as in every other year, we may trace the progre&s;s of good and evil in the world. We may &s;ee the unhappy effects of a &s;tate of imperfection, in the &s;ufferings produced by &s;in. And <HI>we,</HI> my hearers, have &s;een, and realized, many of the ble&s;|&s;ings of a bountiful Parent, in <HI>our own</HI> pre&s;erva|tion, and the enjoyments he has furni&s;hed to us. We have heard of wars, and the rumours of wars, in di&s;tant parts of the world; while <HI>we</HI> have en|joyed the ble&s;&s;ings of peace. We have read of the &s;laughter of the field, and of the &s;word drunk with the blood of its enemies; while <HI>our</HI> fields have only teemed with the ble&s;&s;ings of life, and <HI>our</HI>
&s;words have re&s;ted in their &s;cabbards. We have heard of the deva&s;tations of war, and of the de|&s;truction of thou&s;ands of our fellow-men; while <HI>our</HI> lives have been protected from the weapons of vi|olence, the rage of ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions, and the mad career of ambition and di&s;organization. Our habi|tations
<PB N="14" REF="038323_0014_1011A12EEB03E6E0">
now &s;helter us from the inclemency of winter; a ble&s;&s;ing, at this moment, denied to ma|ny, who have been deprived of it by the ravages of war. We al&s;o are enjoying the fruits of a plen|tiful harve&s;t, while many, on the theatre of the war in Europe, are &s;uffering with hunger. While &s;ome parts of our own country have been vi&s;ited with pe&s;tilence, we, in this part of it, have been ble&s;t with a remarkable degree of health. No epidemic di&s;ea&s;e has come nigh our dwellings, or touched the lives of our citizens. Some indeed have been called to quit this &s;cene of exi&s;tence in the pa&s;t year; but the number has been &s;mall, compared with many other years. It is the common lot of humanity, and what mu&s;t be ex|pected in its pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>But though we have been thus remarkably fa|voured, and have many rea&s;ons to be grateful to God for his goodne&s;s to us in the year pa&s;t, yet we have al&s;o to acknowledge his judgments, and to mourn under the afflicting hand of his providence. As individuals, &s;ome of us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author's Mother died in July.</NOTE> have been called to part with near relatives and friends, which has agi|tated
<PB N="15" REF="038323_0015_1011A1349F71F8F8">
our bo&s;oms, and called the tear of &s;orrow from our eyes. For the&s;e lo&s;&s;es we could mourn in &s;ilence and &s;olitude, and confine, within our own dome&s;tic walls, the expre&s;&s;ions of our grief. But God in his wi&s;e providence has, in the cour&s;e of the pa&s;t year, afflicted us with bereavements as a <HI>people,</HI> and called us to public mourning, by taking from us good and valuable men in public life&mdash;men high in &s;tation&mdash;eminently u&s;eful&mdash;con|&s;picuous for public and private virtues&mdash;orna|ments of religion and &s;ociety&mdash;and greatly beloved by their country and particular acquaintance. It is not &s;ix months &s;ince a SUMNER died, and the gloom of public grief over&s;pread our countenances for the lo&s;s of a mo&s;t excellent Chief Magi&s;trate of this Commonwealth&mdash;a man who was beloved and re&s;pected wherever he was known; and who, as far as the duties of his office extended, evinced what advantages a people enjoy when ble&s;t with a wi&s;e and good governor. Short was the time this ble&s;&s;ing was lent to us in him; but long will his virtues and u&s;efulne&s;s remain in our remembrance.</P>
<P>As the year has drawn nearer to the clo&s;e, God has &s;een fit to afflict us with a more exten&s;ive lo&s;s,
<PB N="16" REF="038323_0016_1011A13625BFCD98">
in taking from us our beloved WASHING|TON;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He died on the 14th of December, 1799.</NOTE> our country's pride, our nation's greate&s;t prop; the man whom he had rai&s;ed up to be the in&s;trument of his providence in working out our <HI>political</HI> &s;alvation. This is a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing national event; it demands, and has, a nation's tears. For we cannot part with one who has been &s;o eminently u&s;eful to us, and is &s;o ju&s;tly univer&s;ally beloved, without deep-felt affliction. That he was the Father of his Country, we all have experienced, in the protection he afforded us in the time of dan|ger; in the wi&s;dom, courage and prudence with which he led our armies, and pre&s;ided in our na|tional councils. That he had a &s;incere affection for his country, is evident from his numerous ac|tions to &s;erve it. This affection, guided by a mind endued with wi&s;dom and integrity, always led him to &s;eek his country's good. That he was not ambitious of power, is &s;een by his re&s;igning that power which had been delegated to him in the field, into the hands of the people again, when he had accompli&s;hed the purpo&s;es, and &s;ecured the object, for which it was given to him. That his
<PB N="17" REF="038323_0017_101184FE73391D08">
country was dearer to him than riches, is evident from the pecuniary &s;acrifices he made to &s;erve it.</P>
<P>Few, if any, good and virtuous patriots have been &s;o fortunate in doing &s;o much for theirs, as WASHINGTON has done for his country. Few have, like him, begun and conducted a revolution through to independence. He was the only com|mander in chief of our armies, through a long and hazardous war, which he terminated with &s;ucce&s;s and glory to him&s;elf and country. He then re&s;igned his &s;word to a grateful people, and &s;oon after re|ceived from them the helm of the national govern|ment, to conduct in peace our political bark, which he had &s;o ably guided amid&s;t the tempe&s;ts of war. He continued at the head of our coun|cils till our government was e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;afety and pro&s;perity. He then retired from the burden of office, &s;o long and &s;o well &s;u&s;tained, to enjoy dome&s;tic ea&s;e and tranquillity. Tho&s;e who were acquainted with his private life, and &s;har|ed his intimacy, &s;peak of him as exemplary in the walks of religion; in the practice of piety and vir|tue; and declare that he was great, good and ami|able in his dome&s;tic circle, as he was in the public &s;phere of life.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="038323_0018_1011A13C1C6DF828">I do not mean to attempt to give you his full and complete character. It is far above the powers of my pen to de&s;cribe it, which is too inadequate to expre&s;s the feelings of my own heart. <HI>You</HI> are acquainted with all his virtues and worth; <HI>you</HI> know how valuable he has been to his country; and <HI>your</HI> grateful hearts, I doubt not, will appre|ciate all his merits. What I have &s;aid, or may &s;ay, of him is not with any expectation of exalting his merit with you; but becau&s;e it would be improper that a per&s;on &s;o great, good, and valuable, &s;hould be taken from us, who&s;e death &s;o ju&s;tly excites univer&s;al mourning, without noticing &s;ome of the virtues which endeared him to us. In our hearts he has erected a monument of love and re&s;pect, which will be as durable as our lives. His con|temporaries, who were the witne&s;&s;es of his actions, need no higher eulogy than to recollect them. To po&s;terity many men of genius, ob&s;ervation, and judgment, will tran&s;mit his name and virtues, which will live as long as this American nation exi&s;ts, at who&s;e birth he pre&s;ided, who&s;e infancy he nouri&s;hed, over who&s;e childhood he watched with a parent's care and &s;olicitude, and which he

never left till it had attained the &s;trength of man|hood.</P>
<P>Perhaps the world never &s;aw an in&s;tance like this, of a young nation advancing with &s;uch rapid and &s;turdy growth. Let us look back to the time when this country was a wilderne&s;s, an un|cultivated &s;cene, and compare it with the pre&s;ent. How &s;oon do we behold it filled with inhabitants, with populous cities, and numerous towns, flou|ri&s;hing under an increa&s;ing commerce, and im|proving agriculture, beyond example! This na|tional pro&s;perity, under the fo&s;tering hand of Pro|vidence, is to be attributed to him who&s;e death we now lament, more than to any other man.</P>
<P>God, to an&s;wer the great, wi&s;e and good de&s;igns of his government of the world, always provides adequate means to accompli&s;h his ends. To in|corporate the people of this part of America into a nation, and e&s;tabli&s;h them in pro&s;perity, he gave them a WASHINGTON for their leader, who was equal to the mighty work. And, having ful|filled his purpo&s;e by him, he has, in his own time, taken him again. In this afflictive di&s;pen&s;ation to us, his goodne&s;s to our departed Father and

Friend is &s;een, and ought to be acknowledged. For it is worthy of remark, that, as this good man died when at the &s;ummit of earthly greatne&s;s, &s;o he died without imbecility of body or mind. He neither outlived him&s;elf, by withering in age, and &s;inking into &s;econd childhood, or doing any one action, through the infirmity of years, that might ca&s;t a &s;hade over his former glory. He died as he lived, with all the honours he ever acquired by his great and good actions bright upon him; and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that affection and veneration he had impre&s;&s;ed, by tho&s;e actions, upon the hearts of a grateful people. The Sovereign of the world, having exhibited him here in &s;o eminent and u&s;e|ful a character, has, by a timely death, exempted him from the common frailties of age, which might have dimini&s;hed his greatne&s;s in our view: per|haps that his example, as a true patriot, might not, in any part of it, be le&s;s perfect than it now is; and that the recollection of it may, through future times, be a u&s;eful le&s;&s;on to others. In his death, then, as in his life, he may be u&s;eful to his country. He has fallen "like a &s;hock of corn fully ripe," in the be&s;t time for him&s;elf. And

in this event we may con&s;ider him as a favourite of Heaven. This we often noticed in the cour&s;e of his public life. We then &s;aw con&s;picuou&s;ly the hand of Providence &s;hielding him in danger, and crowning his military actions with &s;ucce&s;s&punc; and the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom directing him, in our na|tional councils, to tho&s;e mea&s;ures which have &s;e|cured our national glory.</P>
<P>And in him we have an example al&s;o of what has been offered in this di&s;cour&s;e, on the advan|tage of a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>diligent improvement</HI> of time. Without this he never would have been &s;o great, good and u&s;eful as he was. For we are not to un|der&s;tand, by what has been &s;aid above, he was im|mediately in&s;pired by God. By deep reflection and &s;tudy, and by a &s;ocial and active walk in life, he acquired that wi&s;dom to judge <HI>rightly,</HI> and that prudence to act <HI>cautiou&s;ly,</HI> for which he was <HI>emi|nent</HI>; and that knowledge of the world, which enabled him to manage our affairs with &s;o much addre&s;s and advantage. His death has &s;ecured his earthly fame&mdash;his political immortality; and we tru&s;t he is gone to reap the reward of his illu&s;trious labours in the kingdom of his Redeem|er, whom he loved and &s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="038323_0022_1011A146D3311DD0">Though he might have been longer highly &s;erviceable to us, and it would have delighted our hearts to have had him dwelt among us while he could have been u&s;eful, and enjoyed life, that we might have given him the tokens of our gratitude, as we grew in greatne&s;s and pro&s;perity; and felt the benefits of his patrioti&s;m; and have received his &s;age advice and fatherly ble&s;&s;ing: yet, as the great Parent of all, the wi&s;e Governor of the world, has denied us this gratification and favour, let us humbly &s;ubmit to the di&s;pen&s;ation; let us gratefully thank him for having continued his valuable life &s;o long, and made him &s;o u&s;eful to his country.</P>
<P>And let us remember, that though our beloved friend be dead, and his tongue &s;ilent in the grave, he yet &s;peaketh to us in that valuable legacy he has left behind him for our peru&s;al and direction. In his Farwell Addre&s;s, on quitting the office of Pre&s;ident, he is &s;till our coun&s;ellor. And while our hearts are oppre&s;&s;ed with grief for this &s;epara|tion from him, let us &s;eriou&s;ly re&s;olve that we will attend to his in&s;tructions, and follow his coun&s;els, which have &s;o often &s;aved us in the

time of danger, and have led us to unexampled pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>And though I would &s;ay nothing to le&s;&s;en the prai&s;e which is due to the great and good friend we have lo&s;t, yet let us always remem|ber, that he was but the in&s;trument in the hands of God to effect what has been done for us. It is to Him, "who rules in the kingdoms of men," we are primarily indebted for all we have and enjoy, in a national, as well as private, view&mdash;To him let us give the tribute of thank&s;giving and prai&s;e&mdash;To him we mu&s;t look for future ble&s;&s;ings. Though our hopes are in &s;ome mea&s;ure ca&s;t down by this event, they are not de&s;troyed. Our chief tru&s;t and confidence is in God, who will <HI>&s;till</HI> be "the light of our countenance," and pre&s;erve our national independence and pro&s;perity, if we do not for&s;ake him. We have good rea&s;on to pre&s;ume, that he, who gave us a WASHINGTON to make us a free and pro&s;perous nation, will not &s;uffer this work of his hands to be de&s;troyed by the arts of wicked men; unle&s;s we forfeit the in|valuable ble&s;&s;ing of freedom, by becoming the &s;laves of vice, and pro&s;tituting, to the &s;ervice of &s;in, the bounties of his providence.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="038323_0024_1011A14DE1FB91D8">Let us remember, that though God has taken our WASHINGTON from us, he has left us many great and good men, wi&s;e and virtuous pa|triots, to conduct our national affairs. And let us re&s;olve to unite in harmony with them to promote our country's good. Let us &s;olemnly declare, we will always revere, love, and &s;upport, the con&s;titu|tion God has given us, and be obedient to the laws of the government founded upon it. Let us diligently improve our time through the years which may be to come, in the faithful di&s;charge of all duties, religious and civil, patriotic and &s;ocial&mdash; in the exerci&s;e of all public and private virtues. And by our prayers to the great Ruler of the world, the Father of all ble&s;&s;ings, by mutual good coun|&s;els and actions, let us endeavour to give a &s;tability and pro&s;perity to our nation and government, which &s;hall la&s;t, through &s;ucceeding ages, till the angel of God &s;hall again "&s;tand upon the &s;ea and upon the earth" to perform the oath he has &s;worn, "THAT TIME SHALL BE NO LONGER."</P>
