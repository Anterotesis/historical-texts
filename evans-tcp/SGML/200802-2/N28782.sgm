<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE public are at length pre&s;ented with the Report of a Trial, which has awakened unu&s;ual &s;oli|citude among all cla&s;&s;es of people. When it was promi&s;ed at an earlier day, it was not fore&s;een what degree of labor and painful attention would be requi|&s;ite to render it correct. A &s;trong wi&s;h to make it minutely accurate and &s;trictly impartial has nece&s;&s;a|rily protracted the publication to this time. No labor has been &s;pared to obtain this end: five other note-books be&s;ides my own, have been examined and the whole have been carefully collated, and if there is any merit in the performance it lies in its cor|rectne&s;s. The te&s;timony of the principal witne&s;&s;es is given in their own words, that the reader may better weigh their re&s;pective claims to belief: this is what he can never be fairly enabled to do when the reporter undertakes to &s;tate the amount of the te&s;ti|mony, in&s;tead of the te&s;timony it&s;elf, thereby giving nothing more than the impre&s;&s;ions it made upon his own mind. In the peru&s;al of the following &s;heets, it is hoped, &s;omething more may be found than the gratification of a temporary curio&s;ity. The critical ob&s;erver of manners, and the philo&s;opher who makes the human heart his &s;tudy, will, it is believed, be en|abled from the picture here pre&s;ented, to catch a glance at &s;ome features of real life.&mdash;He will here &s;ee the advantage which truth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es over prevarication and fal&s;hood.</P>
<P><PB REF="038372_0004_1011CFBB378D4488">
I cannot help noticing two pamphlets which have already appeared, both pretending to exhibit a cor|rect report of this trial.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is publi&s;hed by one Longworth, and was in print a few hours after the trial was over. This man has &s;eized with avidity upon the moment, when public curio&s;ity was all alive, and if we may credit his own avowal without regard to any thing but re|muneration, he has publi&s;hed ju&s;t &s;uch an account as might naturally be expected from a man acting from &s;uch motives. I &s;hould not have de&s;cended to notice this paltry performance here, had he not put it off by the in&s;inuation of a fal&s;hood. It has been trum|peted round the &s;treets as <HI>"The whole Trial of Levi Weeks, taken in &s;hort hand by a gentleman of the bar."</HI> Although he may feel a pre&s;ent gratification from the &s;ucce&s;s with which the artifice has been attended, yet it is hoped he will find, in the end, that the public will not ea&s;ily forget &s;o gro&s;s an impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The other appears under the name of James Har|die, and is fairly &s;uffered to find its &s;ale in Book&s;ell|er's &s;hops, without the aid of impo&s;ture. But in his &s;tatement of the te&s;timony, he has involved &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es in po&s;itive and material contradictions, where in reality there were none. This may be ac|counted for from the unfavourable &s;ituation in which he &s;at to take his notes, as well as from &s;ome other circum&s;tances not irreconcilable with the mo&s;t inno|cent intentions; but &s;urely a con&s;cientious man cannot but feel &s;ome degree of unea&s;ine&s;s, that he has done a thing in the face of the public&mdash;at once, &s;o injurious to truth, and to the individual who is affected by it. The&s;e remarks are made with &s;ome reluctance upon a man, who I am told, has a con&s;i|derable &s;hare of literary merit.</P>
<P><PB REF="038372_0005_1011CFBE0E3BB8F8">
On the que&s;tion of the Guilt or Innocence of the accu&s;ed, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, as I conceive it is not the province of an individual to re-judge his ca&s;e or arraign the verdict of his peers. After a long and impartial trial, his country have pronounced him Innocent, and the language of that verdict mu&s;t be conclu&s;ive. A faithful exhibition of the facts on which that deci&s;ion was built, is all that is a&s;&s;ign|ed to me, and this duty I have endeavoured to di&s;|charge to the be&s;t of my ability.</P>

<HEAD>TRIAL, &amp;c. MONDAY, MARCH 31.</HEAD>
<P>THE Court a&s;&s;embled at 10 o'clock in the forenoon, and proclamation having been made in the u&s;ual form, the pri&s;oner was put to the Bar.</P>
<P>The Pannel was then called, and thirty-four Jurors appeared and an&s;wered to their names. The Clerk then addre&s;&s;ed the pri&s;oner, "Levi Weeks, pri&s;oner at the bar, hold up your right hand, and hearken to what is &s;aid to you.&mdash;The&s;e good men who have been la&s;t called, and who do now appear, are tho&s;e who are to pa&s;s between the People of the State of New-York, and you, upon your Trial of Life and Death&punc; If, therefore, you will challenge them, or ei|ther of them, your time to challenge is, as they come to the book to be &s;worn, and before they are &s;worn, and you will be heard."</P>
<P>The Clerk then proceeded to call the Jury from the Pannel, and the fir&s;t having come up, and being de&s;ired to place his hand upon the book, he ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Juror and the Pri&s;oner; "Ju|ror, look upon the Pri&s;oner; Pri&s;oner, look upon the Juror&mdash;and admini&s;tered the following Oath: "You &s;hall well and truly try, and true deliverance make, between the People of the State of New-York, and Levi Weeks the pri&s;oner at the bar, whom you &s;hall have in charge, and a true verdict give accord|ing
<PB N="10" REF="038372_0008_1011CFC9440488B0">
to evidence, &s;o help you God." All the Quakers upon the Pannel, excepting James Hunt, as they were called, came up to the Court and reque&s;ted to be excu&s;ed from &s;erving on the Jury, as they had &s;cruples of con&s;cience which prohibited them from &s;itting to determine on a ca&s;e of life and death&mdash;and the court excu&s;ed them accordingly.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner challenged eleven of the Jurors, who were &s;et a&s;ide of cour&s;e; the A&s;&s;i&s;tant Attorney Gen|eral al&s;o challenged one for &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions which he had been informed had dropt from him, but finding it could not be &s;upported, he gave it up.</P>

<Q><P>City and County of New-York, &s;s.</P>
<P>THE Jurors of the people of the State of New-York, in and for the city and county of New-York, on their Oath present, that LEVI WEEKS, late of the seventh ward, of the city of New-York, in the county of New-York, la|bourer, not having the fear of God before his eyes, but being mov|ed and seduced by the instigation of the devil, on the 22d day of December, in the year of our Lord 1799, with force and arms at the ward aforesaid, at the city and county aforesaid, in and upon one GULIELMA SANDS, in the Peace of God, and of the said people then and there being, feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought, did make an assault, and that the said Levi Weeks, then and there feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice a|forethought, did take the said Gulielma Sands into both the hands

And so the Jurors aforesaid, upon their oath aforesaid, do say, that the said Levi Weeks, her the said Gulielma Sands in the manner and form aforesaid, feloniously, wilfully and of his malice aforethought, did then and there kill and murder, against the peace of the said People and there digni|ty:&mdash;And the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> aforesaid, on their oath aforesaid, do further present, That the said Levi Weeks, not having the fear of God before his eyes, but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the Devil, on the same twenty-second day of December, in the year of our Lord 1799, with force and arms, at the same seventh-ward of the city of New-York, in the country of New-York afore|said, in and upon Gulielma Sands, in the peace of God and of the said People, then and there being, feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought, did make an assault, and her the said Gulielma Sands, then and there feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought, did strike, beat, and kick, with his hands and feet, in and upon the head, breast, back, belly, sides, and other parts of the body of her, the said Gulielma Sands, and did then and there feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought, cast, and throw the said Gulielma Sands, down unto and upon the ground, giving unto the said Gulielma Sands, then and there by the beating, striking, and kicking her, the said Gulielma Sands, in manner aforesaid, several mortal strokes, wounds, and bruises, in and upon the head, breast, back, belly, sides, and other parts of the body of her the said Gulielma Sands, of which said mortal wounds, strokes and bruises, the said Gulielma Sands then and there instantly died:&mdash;And so the Jurors aforesaid, upon their oath aforesaid, do say, that the said Levi Weeks, her the said Gu|lielma Sands, in manner and form aforesaid, then and there feloni|ously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought, did kill and mur|der, against the Peace of the said People and their Dignity.</P></Q>
<P>Upon this Indictment the pri&s;oner at the bar hath been arraigned, and on his arraignment, hath plead|ed not guilty, and is now to be tried by his country,
<PB N="12" REF="038372_0010_1011CFCDE9FE2328">
which country you are; &s;o that your charge is, gen|tlemen, to enquire whether the pri&s;oner at the bar is guilty of the felony whereof he &s;tands Indicted, or is not guilty; &s;o fit together and hear your evidence."</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;i&s;tant Attorney General, Mr. Colden, then addre&s;&s;ed the Court and Jury:</P>
<P>"In a cau&s;e which appears &s;o greatly to have excit|ed the public mind, in which the pri&s;oner has thought it nece&s;&s;ary for his defence, to employ &s;o many ad|vocates di&s;tingui&s;hed for their eloquence and abili|ties, &s;o va&s;tly my &s;uperiors in learning, experience and profe&s;&s;ional rank; it is not wonderful that I &s;hould ri&s;e to addre&s;s you under the weight of em|barra&s;&s;ments which &s;uch circum&s;tances naturally ex|cite. But gentlemen, although the abilities enlift|ed on the re&s;pective &s;ides of this cau&s;e are very un|equal, I find con&s;olation in the reflection, that our ta&s;ks are &s;o al&s;o. While to my opponents it belongs as their duty to exert all their powerful talents in favour of the pri&s;oner, as a public pro&s;ecutor, I offer you in its proper order, all the te&s;timony the ca&s;e affords, draw from the witne&s;&s;es which may be produced on either &s;ide all that they know, and if I can guard you again&s;t the influence of &s;ophi&s;try and eloquence, I &s;hall be &s;atisfied. Had I the power of enlisting the pa&s;&s;ions and bia&s;&s;ing the judgement, which tho&s;e oppo&s;ed to me po&s;&s;e&s;s, I &s;hould think it unju&s;tifiable to exert it on &s;uch an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Levi Weeks, the pri&s;oner at the bar, is indicted for the murder of Gulielma Sands. He is a young man of reputable connections, and for ought we know, till he was charged with this crime, of irre|proachable character, nay of amiable and engaging manners, in&s;omuch that he had gained the affections of tho&s;e who are now to appear again&s;t him as wit|ne&s;&s;es on this trial for his life. The&s;e are circum|&s;tances
<PB N="13" REF="038372_0011_1011CFCF70CEDF80">
greatly in his favour, and there is no rea&s;on to fear that they will not be urged with all their force. We are aware that you will not convict &s;uch a one of the horrid crime of which he is accu&s;ed upon le&s;s than the utmo&s;t evidence that the nature of the ca&s;e admits, and that you will not readily be convinced that one &s;o young has already embrued his hands in the blood of the innocent.</P>
<P>The decea&s;ed was a young girl, who till her fatal acquaintance with the pri&s;oner, was virtuous and mode&s;t, and it will be material for you to remark, always of a cheerful di&s;po&s;ition, and lively manners, though of a delicate con&s;titution. We expect to prove to you that the pri&s;oner won her affections, and that her virtue fell a &s;acrifice to his affiduity; that after a long period of criminal intercour&s;e be|tween them, he deluded her from the hou&s;e of her, protector under a pretence of marrying her, car|ried her away to a well in the &s;uburbs of this city, and there murdered her.&mdash;<HI>(Here the A&s;&s;i&s;t. Att'y Gen. &s;uddenly &s;topped a few &s;econds.)</HI>&mdash;No wonder, gentlemen that my mind &s;hudders at this picture, and requires a moment to recollect it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In order to enable you to direct your attention the better to the te&s;timony that will be offered, I &s;hall proceed to detail to you more particularly the proof which I expect will be made.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay gentlemen, what may be your verdict as to the pri&s;oner, but I will venture to affert, that not one of you or any man who hears this cau&s;e, &s;hall doubt that the unfortunate young creature who was found dead in the Manhattan well, was mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly murdered.</P>
<P>Elias Ring, and Catherine his wife, keep a board|ing-hou&s;e in the upper part of Greenwich-&s;treet; the
<PB N="14" REF="038372_0012_1011CFD1399D5420">
decea&s;ed was a di&s;tant relation of theirs who lived with them. Hope Sands, a &s;i&s;ter of Mr. Ring, and Margaret Clark, lived in the &s;ame hou&s;e. In July la&s;t, the pri&s;oner was received into the hou&s;e as a boarder. Upon his fir&s;t coming, for about a month, he &s;hewed &s;ome attention to Margaret Clark, but &s;oon after was ob&s;erved to attach him&s;elf in a very particular manner to the decea&s;ed. Their conduct &s;oon led to &s;u&s;picions in the family, that there was an improper intercour&s;e between them. In the month of September, Mrs. Ring fled from the fever, leav|ing the care of her hou&s;e to her hu&s;band, and the decea&s;ed; and leaving in it al&s;o the pri&s;oner and &s;ome other boarders. Mrs. Ring remained out of town a|bout &s;ix weeks, and in that time it is certain that the pri&s;oner and the decea&s;ed lived together in the mo&s;t intimate manner. On the fir&s;t of December la&s;t, the decea&s;ed di&s;clo&s;ed to Hope Sands, that on the next Sunday &s;he was to be married to the pri|&s;oner, but at this time, and whenever afterwards &s;he &s;poke on the &s;ubject, enjoined on Hope the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ecrecy, forbidding her to tell even Mrs. Ring, &s;ay|ing that Levi meant to keep their marriage a &s;ecret, even from her (Hope) and therefore that no one &s;hould go with them to &s;ee the ceremony perform|ed.</P>
<P>Between this time and the time of her departure from the hou&s;e, it will be &s;een, &s;he frequently &s;poke of her approaching marriage, and always with cheer|fulne&s;s and a lively plea&s;ure. On Saturday, the 21&s;t of December, the day before the fatal accident&mdash;Hope di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;ecret to Mrs. Ring, informing her, that Elma was to be married the next evening. On the Sunday about dinner-time, Mrs. Ring di&s;covered to the decea&s;ed, that &s;he knew her intentions. The decea&s;ed, you will find, then confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he was to
<PB N="15" REF="038372_0013_1011CFD2D327DAB8">
be married, and that the pri&s;oner was to come for her that night at 8 o'clock. Mrs. Ring pre&s;&s;ed the decea&s;ed to be of the party&mdash;She &s;aid Levi would not con&s;ent, as he meant to keep his marriage a perfect &s;ecret from all. In the evening you will &s;ee, the decea&s;ed began to dre&s;s her&s;elf, in which Mrs. Ring a&s;&s;i&s;ted her; the decea&s;ed appeared perfectly cheerful all this time, &s;he put on her hat and &s;hawl, and went to a neighbor's and borrowed a mu&s;&s; which &s;he pro|mi&s;ed to return in a little time. She al&s;o took up a pocket-handkerchief belonging to one of the boarders, &s;aying &s;he &s;hould not make u&s;e of it, and would return it before it was mi&s;&s;ed. You will have evidence that the pri&s;oner had left the hou&s;e of Mr. Ring, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and that about eight o'clock in the evening the decea&s;ed &s;tood leaning over the front door, looking out&mdash;that Mrs. Ring de&s;ired her to come in, &s;aying, &s;he did not believe Levi would come, to which &s;he an&s;wered, &s;he did not fear, it was not yet eight, but &s;he left the door and went in with Mrs. Ring, and in a little time the pri&s;oner re|turned, and came into the room where was Elias Ring, Mrs. Ring, the decea&s;ed, and two boarders, by the names of Lacey and Ru&s;&s;el. Mrs. Ring <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> with them about five minutes, when &s;he got up and went to the &s;treet&punc;door, and leaned over it till Lacey and Ru&s;&s;el went up-&s;tairs to bed. She then left the &s;treet door, and as &s;he does perfectly remember, &s;hut it after her; &s;he went into the room again, and was hardly seated when the decea&s;ed went up &s;tairs; Mrs. Ring immediately followed her, found her in her room above, pinned on the &s;hawl for her, and after being with her not more than two minutes, left her in the room oppo&s;ite the &s;tairs, ju&s;t on the point of coming down. Mrs. Ring returned to the room below where the pri&s;oner was; in about a minute he
<PB N="16" REF="038372_0014_1011CFD467AA7AE0">
took up his hat, and as he opened the room-door to go out, Mrs. Ring heard &s;omebody come lightly down the &s;tairs, and as &s;he &s;uppo&s;es, meet him at the bottom; &s;he then heard two voices whi&s;pering at the foot of the &s;tairs for about a minute, &s;he then heard the &s;treet door open and immediately &s;hut, &s;he took a candle and went to the door to look after them but it was dark and &s;o many people pa&s;&s;ing, that &s;he could not di&s;tinguish any one. The &s;treet door you will find, opens with a great and remarkable noi&s;e, in con&s;equence of its being out of order. Gentlemen, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for you to pay particular attention to this part of the evidence, for if you do believe that the pri&s;oner, at this time, went out of the hou&s;e with the decea&s;ed&mdash;I do not &s;ee how he can be acquit|ted. After Mrs. Ring &s;hut the door, it was not again opened till the time when &s;he &s;uppo&s;es the pri&s;oner and the decea&s;ed went out. We &s;hall &s;how you that there were no other per&s;ons in the hou&s;e till ten or eleven o'clock, but Elias Ring, who remained in the common &s;itting room, and the two lodgers, Lacey and Ru&s;&s;el, who we &s;hall prove to you lodged together, and were not out of their lodging-room, from the time they went up &s;tairs. From this time the decea&s;ed was never after &s;een till her corps was found in the Man|hattan Well. She had the marks of great violence upon her, and great part of her cloaths were torn off.</P>
<P>We &s;hall produce a number of witne&s;&s;es, who, between the hours of 8 &amp; 9 of the evening of the 22d of December, heard, from about the place of the well, the voice of a female crying murder, and entreating for mercy. It will be &s;hown to you, gentlemen, that there was the track of a &s;ingle hor&s;e &s;leigh, which we &s;hall prove that at &s;ome time between the Satur|day night before, and Monday morning &s;ucceeding,
<PB N="17" REF="038372_0015_1011CFDC47D5FF28">
mu&s;t have come out of Greenwich &s;treet, and pa&s;&s;ed in a very extraordinary manner near the brink of the well; that the snow round the edge of the well was much trodden, and that the &s;leigh after having made a curious turn or &s;top near the well, mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed on to the Broadway road, and in coming into that, turned towards town.</P>
<P>We &s;hall proceed to &s;hew you, that on the evening after the 22d of December, &s;oon after the decea&s;ed left her hou&s;e, &s;he was met a few hundred yards from her hou&s;e in the way towards the road that leads to the well, in company with two men. That a few hundred yards further on, and about the &s;ame time, a &s;ingle hor&s;e &s;leigh was &s;een with two men and a woman in it; the hor&s;e of a dark colour and with|out bells, pa&s;&s;ing on towards the road or &s;treet which leads from Greenwich &s;treet to the well.</P>
<P>Our next te&s;timony will be, to prove to you, that a number of young gentlemen riding for plea&s;ure on the &s;ame evening, as they were coming into town, between 8 and 9 o'clock, on the Broadway road, when they were &s;ome di&s;tance nearer to the town than the place where the track of the one hor&s;e &s;leigh was di&s;covered to have turned into the Broadway road, they were overtaken by a &s;ingle hor&s;e &s;leigh, which pa&s;&s;ed them with the hor&s;e on a full gallop&punc; and without bells; there were two men in it and the hor&s;e was dark coloured. We &s;hall then &s;how you that Mr. Ezra Weeks, the brother of the pri&s;oner&punc; was the owner of a &s;ingle &s;leigh, and a dark hor&s;e, and that the pri&s;oner had acce&s;s to it when he cho&s;e, and we &s;hall produce to you &s;uch te&s;timony, as we &s;uppo&s;e will &s;atisfy you that this hor&s;e and &s;leigh was taken out of the yard of Ezra Weeks, about 8 o'clock in the evening of the 22d of December, and
<PB N="18" REF="038372_0016_1011CFDF33A89048">
was returned again into the yard in le&s;s than half an hour.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee, gentlemen of the Jury, that we have only circum&s;tantial evidence to offer to you in this ca&s;e, and you mu&s;t al&s;o perceive that from its nature it admits of no other. I &s;hall, however, re&s;erve my remarks upon this &s;ubject, for a future &s;tage in the cau&s;e; and &s;hall, without delaying you longer, pro|ceed to call the witne&s;&s;es.</P>

<P>Mr. A&s;&s;i&s;tant-Attorney-General &s;aid, that he &s;hould not now make any objections to it, as it appeared that the &s;ituation of the witne&s;s was &s;uch that her per&s;onal attendance was ab&s;olutely impo&s;sible. Whereupon, Mr. Ju&s;tice Lansing went with the A&s;&s;i&s;tant-Attor|ney-General and Gen. Hamilton, to take the depo&s;i|tion of the witne&s;s. After they has returned into Court, the fir&s;t witne&s;s on the part of the pro&s;ecution was called.</P>
<P>CATHARINE RING affirmed.&mdash;[It was now moved that the hu&s;band of the witne&s;s, being al&s;o a witne&s;s, &s;hould withdraw out of hearing during her

examination, which the court ordered, &s;aying the pri&s;oner had a right to it of cour&s;e, if he reque&s;ted it.]</P>
<P>The witne&s;s then proceeded:</P>
<P>In July la&s;t Levi weeks came to board in our family, &s;oon after which he began to pay attention to Margaret Clark, till about the 28th of the 8th Month, when &s;he went into the country. About two days after her ab&s;ence, Gulielma Sands <HI>"asked me"</HI>&mdash;Here &s;he was &s;topped by the coun&s;el for the pri|&s;oner, who prayed the opinion of the Court, whe|ther any declarations of the decea&s;ed were admi&s;&s;i|ble as evidence. They contended that this was a ca&s;e of hear-&s;ay te&s;timony, and did not come within any of the exceptions in the books.&mdash;They admitted that the declarations of a murdered per&s;on were &s;ometimes received as evidence again&s;t a pri&s;oner, but it was only when they were made after the fatal blow, in his la&s;t moments and when he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be under an equal &s;olemnity with that of an oath.</P>
<P>The Attorney-General in&s;i&s;ted that &s;uch te&s;timony was proper to &s;how the di&s;po&s;ition of mind in the decea&s;ed, when &s;he left the hou&s;e on the night of the fatal accident; that this was the only way to di&s;cover whether &s;he was found in her intellects, or whether &s;he was not under the impre&s;&s;ions of melancholy&mdash;and that in reality, this was one of tho&s;e ca&s;es, where evidence was to be admitted upon the nece&s;&s;ity of the thing. To &s;upport his argument he produced 4 State Trials, 487, 488, idem 291, 298; Leeche's ca&s;es, 399, idem 397, idem 437; 2 Bacon 563; Skinner's Reports 402.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. B. Livingston</HI> replied. He denied that State Trials was any authority. The ca&s;e in Skinner he &s;aid was certainly not law; and he read an authority from Hawkins, P. C. 447, and the ca&s;e from Leech, 347, was in oppo&s;ition to the principle contended for on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="038372_0018_1011CF2B9009F118">
<HI>Col. Burr</HI> &s;ubjoined a few remarks. After &s;tating what he thought ought to be the only exception to receiving hear-&s;ay evidence, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That it mu&s;t be con|fined to ca&s;es <HI>in extremis</HI> after the fatal blow given, he ob&s;erved, that be&s;ides that the book is no authori|ty in the fir&s;t ca&s;e read by the A&s;&s;i&s;tant-Attorney-General, the witne&s;s was &s;uffered to proceed without interruption, and no point was made to the Court re&s;pecting it. As to the 2d. ca&s;e, it wasin the court of &s;e&s;&s;ions in Scotland, and could not be con&s;idered as any authority here. He affirmed that Woodcock's ca&s;e, although produced on the other &s;ide, was per|fectly con&s;i&s;tent with the opinion which he held.</P>
<P>The Court unanimou&s;ly refu&s;ed to admit the te&s;timony.</P>
<P>The witne&s;s then went on, being told to &s;uppre&s;s whatever Elmore <HI>had said</HI> to her.&mdash;"Elmore lived in our hou&s;e with us three years, as our child. After Margaret Clark had gone into the country a few days, Levi became very attentive to Elmore, to whom I mentioned it, and &s;he did not deny it. She and Levi were left together with my hu&s;band either the 10th or the 11th of the 9th month.</P>

<P>After I had been ab&s;ent about 4 weeks, I received a let|er from my hu&s;band, de&s;iring me to come home as he was very lone&s;ome. I at fir&s;t determined to return imme|diately, but I always thought Levi a man of honor, and that he did not intend to promi&s;e further than he intended to perform; therefore I &s;tayed two weeks longer, and I came home &s;ix weeks to a day. After my return I paid &s;trict attention to their conduct, and &s;aw an appearance of mutual attachment, but nothing improper; and always di&s;covered &s;ufficient in their countenance to convince me what was in agitation between them; and he was frequently in the room when &s;he was &s;ick. In a &s;hort time after my return,
<PB N="21" REF="038372_0019_1011CFEE110B4FD0">
&s;he concluded to pay a vi&s;it to her friends in the country, though &s;he did not &s;eem very anxious to go as it was &s;o late in the &s;ea&s;on; however, after &s;he got ready to go, Levi accompanied her to the ve&s;&s;el, and &s;he &s;tayed about two weeks. During her indi&s;|po&s;ition he paid her the &s;tricte&s;t attention, and &s;pent &s;everal nights in the room, &s;aying he did not like to leave her with Hope, (my &s;i&s;ter) fearing &s;he might get to &s;leep and neglect her; and in the night he want|ed to go for a phy&s;ician, but I di&s;couraged him, think|ing &s;he would get better by the morning. One night, after &s;he had got much better, chu&s;ing to &s;leep alone, &s;he went to bed; and as I &s;uppo&s;ed, Levi was gone al&s;o. <HI>(Here the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner &s;topped the wit|ne&s;s, to inform the court that Elias Ring, although order|ed out, had returned and was &s;tanding behind his wife the witne&s;s; the court ordered the con&s;table to take him out, and reprimanded him for his behaviour.)</HI> In about two hours I thought I would &s;tep up into her room and &s;ee how &s;he did&mdash;I &s;lipped off my &s;hoes, and going quick without making much noi&s;e, I partly opened the door, and &s;aw him &s;itting by the &s;ide of her bed, and the door was &s;hut again&s;t me, I took it to be by him, be|cau&s;e &s;he was in bed and could not reach the door.&mdash;The next morning he &s;aid he had made a fire ju&s;t before day in his own room, and he di&s;covered more concern than I expected.</P>
<P>Not a day pa&s;&s;ed but convinced me more and more that he was paying his attentions to her; I often found &s;itting and &s;tanding together, and once in parti|cular I found them &s;itting together on her bed. On the 22nd of December, my &s;i&s;ter Hope went to meeting, and Levi went to his brother's; in a &s;hort time he return|ed, having fallen and hurt his knee, which circum|&s;tance, it &s;truck my mind, would prevent their inten|tions for that time; Sylvanus Ru&s;&s;el &s;aid, Levi you

After &s;he had dre&s;&s;ed it&mdash;he went up &s;tairs a &s;hort time&mdash;&s;he al&s;o followed him, and was gone I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, con&s;iderably more than an hour, this was about noon. His apprentice came down to do &s;ome|thing, and in a little time went up, but &s;oon, returned again; the thought &s;truck me that they had &s;ent him down to get him out of the way. Between 12 and 1 o' clock &s;he came down into the room where I was pre|paring dinner, with a &s;miling countenance, and &s;eemed much plea&s;ed. I &s;pent the afternoon with her; her coun|tenance and behaviour was calm and compo&s;ed, and fully happy, as likewi&s;e her appetite remarkably good. I left her a &s;hort time, and went into another room; when I returned, I found Levi &s;itting by the &s;ire with her, appearing fully compo&s;ed and happy; but he &s;oon left us and went up &s;tairs&mdash;&s;hortly after Elma went al&s;o; in about 20 minutes &s;he returned not quite dre&s;&s;ed, with her handkerchief in her hand, &s;aying to me, "which looks be&s;t?" Then Levi came down, nearly dre&s;&s;ed al&s;o, with his coat upon his arm, at which time, Elma &s;tepped behind the curtain of the bed. "He &s;aid, "where's Elma?" I &s;aid, "&s;he is hid behind the bed." He &s;aid dont mind me&mdash;I want you to tie my hair. Elma came out and did &s;o; Elias came in from meeting, and &s;he went up &s;tairs, and Levi after her: this was about &s;un-&s;et, and &s;he did not come down till after dark, and Levi I believe &s;taid as long, for one of the family went up and found them together. I had got tea ready and waited &s;ome time for them to drink tea, thinking they would drink tea together; but he did not come. After tea I propo&s;ed borrowing a muff for her at one of our neighbor's&mdash;&s;he &s;aid would go her&s;elf, and &s;he went and got it.

A while after &s;he went to the front door and leaned over it, which I &s;oon ob&s;erved.

Mrs. Ring, don't grieve &s;o, I am in hopes things will turn out better than you expect; to which I gave no an&s;wer, as I expected he was then going to tell me the whole matter. He &s;oon however took his hat and went away. Nothing more was &s;aid un|til afternoon, when my&s;elf and &s;i&s;ter being &s;o di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed we determined to &s;tand it no longer, and we were about to &s;end for him when he again came in, laid down his hat; but on &s;eeing our agitation, he turned round and was going out; I &s;aid, &s;top Levi, this matter has become &s;o &s;erious. I can &s;tand it no longer; I then &s;aid it certainly lays upon thee, therefore thee mu&s;t make the be&s;t of thy way to get clear of it; he &s;aid, he was willing to give what &s;atisfaction he could, being &s;orry to &s;ee us &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, when I &s;aid if it had been many a per&s;on that I &s;hould have even been willing for her to have, I would not have waited one hour before they &s;hould have given an account of her, but my confidence in thee was &s;o great, and fearing too to make her trou|ble, as &s;he was bound not to di&s;clo&s;e it, is the rea|&s;ons why I did not immediately mention it. I then proceeded. On fir&s;t day after 12 o'clock, &s;he came down &s;tairs after being with thee, and told me, that night at eight o'clock you were going to be married, that you did not go till 8 o'clock on ac|count of its being froze. I had not proceeded much further, if any, before he turned pale; trembled to a great degree; was much agitated, and began to cry, cla&s;ping his hands together, cried out, I'm ru|ined&mdash;I'm ruined&mdash;I'm undone forever, unle&s;s &s;he appears to clear me&mdash;my exi&s;tence will be only a burden&mdash;I had rather die in credit, than live under it. Then he proceeded to clear him&s;elf, &s;aying, he

never would attempt to marry without his brother's approbation. I replied, &s;he told me, thee had talk|ed to him twice on the &s;ubject; he &s;aid my brother can an&s;wer for him&s;elf.

<P>On Thur&s;day, the 26th of December, about 10 o'clock, Margaret Clark and her &s;i&s;ter Deborah Clark, being in the room with me, Levi came in; &s;eeing us much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, he &s;at down and endeavoured to com|fort and con&s;ole us, &s;aying, <HI>Give her up, &s;he is gone no doubt, and all our grieving would do no good.</HI> With an earne&s;t look I turned to him, &s;aying, Levi, give me thy firm opinion from the bottom of thy heart, for I dont doubt thee has one; tell me the truth, what thee thinks has become of her.

<P>&mdash;On the 2d of January la&s;t, I together with Mr. Page, had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to do in breaking a hor&s;e, and we went up to Andrew Blancks, and we dined there: Blanck in&s;i&s;ted upon it. While we were dining two per&s;ons, Mr. Watkins and Mr. Elias Ring, came there to get hooks and poles to &s;ound the Manhattan well for the body of a young woman who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be drowned. We got the poles and nails and went all together to the well, which we uncovered. Page took the pole fir&s;t and &s;aid he thought he felt her; I took hold then and thought I felt her too. Watkins drove in the nails, I took the pole and hooked the nail in her clothes and drew her up carefully to the top of the water: as &s;oon as Mr. Ring &s;aw her callico gown he &s;aid it was &s;he, he knew the gown. She was &s;o heavy now we could not draw her out by the nail and the little boy went for a rope to the next hou&s;e, while I held her &s;till. I put the rope under her and drew her up gent|ly, &s;he &s;lew'd round but there was not a thread of her clothes which touched either &s;ide of the well. When &s;he was drawn up we laid her on a plank, and &s;he ap|peared in &s;uch a &s;ituation as if &s;he had been murdered.</P>

<P>&mdash;I had a &s;light ac|quaintance with Elma Sands: On the 22d of Decem|ber, I lent her my muff, &s;he came to borrow it her&s;elf, and I ob&s;erved that &s;he was very neatly dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;he &s;eemed to be very lively and very happy.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<P>Some conver&s;ation ari&s;ing, as to the time when the muff was found, it was admitted by the Attorney|General, that it was found &s;ome days before the body was di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Mr. WILLIAMS te&s;tified that at the reque&s;t of the Attorney-General, he had made an experiment in what time a man might drive a hor&s;e the mo&s;t u&s;ual rout from Ring's to the Manhattan well, and from there back again to Ezra Week's down Barley-&s;treet, and that although the roads were bad, he performed it once in 15 minutes and once in 16, without going out of a trot.</P>
<P>SYLVESTER BUSKIRK was with the last witne&s;s at the time he &s;poke of, and corroborated what he &s;aid. He te&s;tified that Ezra Week's hou&s;e had &s;tood in his &s;table for &s;ale, and was a good hor&s;e to appearance.</P>
<P>Mr. CROSS te&s;tified that he is acquainted with Ezra Week's hor&s;e, and calls him a very good one, thinks he will go a mile in 5 minutes.</P>
<P>The evidence being clo&s;ed, the A&s;&s;i&s;tant Attorney-General addre&s;&s;ed a few words to the jury on the nature of circum&s;tantial evidence, and read the fol|lowing pa&s;&s;age from Morgan's E&s;&s;ay, p. 208.</P>
<P>Circum&s;tantial evidence is all that can be expected, and indeed all that is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub&s;tantiate &s;uch a
<PB N="63" REF="038372_0061_1011D303976238A8">
charge. The prejudice entertained again&s;t receiving circum&s;tantial evidence is carried to a pitch wholly in|excu&s;able. In &s;uch a ca&s;e as this it mu&s;t be received, becau&s;e the nature of the enquiry, for the mo&s;t part, does not admit of any other; and, con&s;equently, it is the be&s;t evidence that can po&s;&s;ibly be given. But tak|ing it in a more general &s;en&s;e, a concurrence of cir|cum&s;tances (which we mu&s;t always &s;uppo&s;e to be pro|perly authenticated, otherwi&s;e they weigh nothing) forms a &s;tronger ground of belief than po&s;itive and direct te&s;timony generally affords, e&s;pecially when unconfirmed by circum&s;tances. The rea&s;on of this is obvious: a po&s;itive allegation may be founded in mi&s;take, or, what is too common, in the perjury of the witne&s;s; but circum&s;tances cannot lie; and a long chain of well connected fabricated circum&s;tances, re|quires an ingenuity and skill rarely to be met with; and &s;uch a con&s;i&s;tency in the per&s;ons who come to &s;up|port tho&s;e circum&s;tances by their oaths, as the annals of our courts of ju&s;tice can &s;eldom produce. Be|&s;ides, circum&s;tantial evidence is much more ea&s;ily di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed, and much more ea&s;ily contradicted by te&s;ti|mony if fal&s;e, than the po&s;itive and direct allegation of a fact, which, being confined to the knowledge of an individual, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be the &s;ubject of con|tradiction founded merely on pre&s;umption and proba|bility.</P>

The TESTIMONY on the part of the pro&s;ecution being clo&s;ed, one of the Counsel for the Prisoner then opened the defence, and addre&s;&s;ed the Jurors to the following effect:&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>THE patience with which you have li&s;tened to this lengthy and tedious detail of te&s;timony is ho|norable to your characters. It evinces your &s;olicitude to di&s;charge the awful duties which are impo&s;ed upon you, and it affords a happy pre&s;age, that your minds are not infected by that blind and undi&s;criminating prejudice which had already marked the pri&s;oner for its victim.</P>
<P>You have relieved me from my greate&s;t anxiety, for I know the unexampled indu&s;try that has been ex|erted to de&s;troy the reputation of the accu&s;ed, and to immolate him at the &s;hrine of per&s;ecution without the &s;olemnity of a candid and impartial trial. I know that hatred, revenge and cruelty, all the vindictive and ferocious pa&s;&s;ions have a&s;&s;embled in terrible array and exerted' every engine to gratify their malice. The thou&s;and tongues of rumour have been &s;teadily em|ployed in the fabrication and di&s;&s;emination of fal&s;e|hoods;, and every method has been taken to render their &s;landers univer&s;al. We have witne&s;&s;ed the ex|traordinary means which have been adopted to enflame the public pa&s;&s;ions and to direct the fury of popular re&s;entment again&s;t the pri&s;oner. Why has the body been expo&s;ed for days in the public &s;treets in a man|ner the mo&s;t indecent and &s;hocking?&mdash;to attract the curio&s;ity and arou&s;e the feelings of numberle&s;s &s;pecta|tors. Such dreadful &s;cenes &s;peak powerfully to the pa&s;&s;ions: they petrify the mind with horror&mdash;congeal the blood within our veins&mdash;and excite the human bo&s;om with irre&s;i&s;tible, but undefineable emotions.
<PB N="65" REF="038372_0063_1011D308CE69F100">
When &s;uch emotions are once created they are not ea&s;ily &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>It has happened in this ca&s;e, that there have been attempts made to call up public &s;en&s;ibility, to excite re&s;entment again&s;t this unfortunate man; in this way, gentlemen, the public opinion comes to be formed unfavourably, and long before the pri&s;oner is brought to his trial he is already condemned. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e rumours can have any weight with a Court of Ju&s;tice, but no man is altogether above being moved by &s;uch reports&mdash;and it requires &s;ome fortitude to with&s;tand them; but now having heard the whole which can be &s;aid, you are prepared to de|termine whether the witne&s;&s;es have always &s;poken with candor, or whether they have not &s;poken from tem|per, hatred and revenge.</P>
<P>We rely on it at fir&s;t that there is nothing from which a di&s;creet Jury can condemn the pri&s;oner; in the very commencement of the bu&s;ine&s;s it is involved in doubt. Notwith&s;tanding there may be te&s;timony of an intimacy having &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the pri&s;oner and the decea&s;ed, we &s;hall &s;how you that there was nothing like a real court&s;hip, or &s;uch a cour&s;e of con|duct as ought to induce impartial people to entertain a belief that marriage was intended; for it will be &s;een that she manife&s;ted equal partiality for other per&s;ons as for Mr. Weeks. It will be &s;hewn that &s;he was in the habit of being frequently out of evenings, and could give no good account of her&s;elf; that she had at &s;ome time a&s;&s;erted that she had pa&s;t the eve|ning at hou&s;es, where it afterwards appeared &s;he had not been. We shall show you that if &s;u&s;picions may attach any where, there are tho&s;e on whom they may be fa&s;tened with more appearance of truth than on the pri&s;oner at the bar. Certainly you are not in this place to condemn others, yet it will relieve your
<PB N="66" REF="038372_0064_1011D30C5C4BBE70">
minds of a burden. There will be two modes of giv|ing a &s;olution&mdash;fir&s;t, that the decea&s;ed &s;ometimes ap|peared melancholy, that &s;he was a dependant upon this family, and that a gloomy &s;en&s;e of her &s;ituation might have led her to de&s;troy her&s;elf. As to the in|cident of the &s;leigh, we &s;hall account for his whole time during that evening, except about 15 minutes, which was employed in walking from one hou&s;e to another; and we &s;hall &s;how you, that the whole of his conduct has been &s;uch, as totally to repel the idea of guilt. It will appear, that at ten o'clock the same evening, he &s;upped at his brother's perfectly tranquil. The &s;tory you will &s;ee, is broken, di&s;connected, and utterly impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;We &s;hall &s;how you that the &s;leigh of Ezra Weeks was not out that evening, indeed the te&s;timony of the good old woman was &s;uch, as could not gain the lea&s;t belief, e&s;pecially when you &s;ee that in matter of date and time &s;he was totally lo&s;t: It will be &s;hown you that on this occa&s;ion there have been violent attempts, to inflame the public mind again&s;t the pri&s;oner, and if we &s;hall bring the&s;e home to &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es, we hope you will pronounce them altogether unworthy of credit&mdash;for a man to fore&s;tall the public opinion, is to arre&s;t the hand of ju&s;tice and de&s;erves the &s;evere&s;t reprehension, and &s;uch conduct we &s;hall fix on the witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>We &s;hall &s;how you that the pri&s;oner has been uni|formly well &s;poken of, more highly e&s;teemed than one of his years, not only for his deportment, but for his morals. That a man of &s;uch a character &s;hould be impelled, without motive, to the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;o horrid a crime, cannot be believed. Much has been &s;aid about the appearance of guilt and terror in the pri&s;oner when charged with the crime. But, gentle|men, no man is armed with &s;o much firmne&s;s of nerves that when charged with a crime, he will not di&s;co|ver
<PB N="67" REF="038372_0065_1011D31110AC43C8">
great emotion; when, therefore, per&s;ons of little di&s;cernment come forward and &s;ay that they &s;aw emo|tions of alarm and terror, no man however innocent as an angel, is &s;afe; the emotions of &s;urprize may be con&s;trued by the ignorant or the malicious into tho&s;e of guilt. A man charged with a henious crime may even prevaricate; we &s;hall &s;how you the ca&s;e of a young man, who, being charged with the crime of murder, even brought a young woman dre&s;&s;ed to re|&s;emble the one he was charged with murdering&mdash;this was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a circum&s;tance &s;o conclu&s;ive of his guilt that he was convicted and executed, and af|terwards the young woman was found to be alive. Even in this very city a ca&s;e had occured, not many years ago, a young man had been charged with the crime of rape. It is yet fre&s;h in the minds of every body. The public mind was there highly incen&s;ed, and even after the unfortunate man had been acquitted by a verdict of a jury, &s;o irritated and enflamed were the people, that the magi&s;trates were in&s;ulted, and they threatened to pull down the hou&s;e of the pri&s;on|er's coun&s;el. After that a civil &s;uit was commenced for the injury done the girl, a very enormous &s;um given in damages, and the defendant was ignomini|ou&s;ly confined within the walls of a pri&s;on. Now it has come out that the accu&s;ation was certainly fal&s;e and malicious.</P>
<P>If this doctrine of pre&s;umptive evidence is to pre|vail, and to be &s;ufficient to convict, what remor&s;e of con&s;cience mu&s;t a juror feel for having convicted a man who afterwards appeared to be innocent. In ca&s;es depending upon a chain of circum&s;tance, all the fabric mu&s;t hang together or the wuole will tumble down. We &s;hall, however, not depend altogether on the weakne&s;s of proof on the part of the pro&s;ecution, we &s;hall bring forward &s;uch proof as will not leave to
<PB N="68" REF="038372_0066_1011D313C3811070">
you even to balance in your minds, whether the pri|&s;oner is Guilty or Not&mdash;from even that burden we &s;hall relieve you.</P>
<P>But before we come to the te&s;timony, on the part of the pri&s;oner, it may be well to examine a little more into the nature of the evidence on the part of the pro&s;ecution. It may be material to di&s;cover how much of this te&s;timony which we have heard, is the effect of a prejudiced imagination; in ca&s;es, people relate fir&s;t with an hone&s;t zeal to relate as an opinion, next as a matter of fact. The only material facts on which I would ob&s;erve here, is the expre&s;&s;ion a&s;cribed to the pri&s;oner, of the Manhattan Well, but that cir|cum&s;tance will be &s;ati&s;factorily accounted for, by pro|ving to you that he had been previou&s;ly informed that the muff had been found there, and it was therefore natural to enquire if the body was not found there al&s;o&mdash;If, gentlemen, we &s;how you all this, you will be able to &s;ay, before leaving your &s;eats, that there is nothing to warrant you in pronouncing the pri&s;oner Guilty.</P>

<P>&mdash;I was called upon toge|ther with Dr. Prince, on the 3d of January la&s;t to at|tend a Coroner's inque&s;t on the body of Elma Sands, and I was de&s;ired particularly, by the jury, to examine and &s;ee if &s;he was pregnant. There were no marks of violence&mdash;and we di&s;covered, to the &s;atisfaction of the jury, that &s;he was not pregnant. It was &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome of the jury that her neck was broke: I ex|amined and found it was not, neither was the collar bone di&s;located. The &s;carf skin of the face was &s;cratched as with gravel&mdash;near the in&s;tep there was a &s;mall &s;pot
<PB N="78" REF="038372_0076_1011D332E0E83D78">
like a blood bli&s;ter. It &s;eemed as if the knee had been injured by falling upon coar&s;e gravel&mdash;there was a &s;pot upon the brea&s;t, but there were no marks of vi|olence upon the belly&mdash;I think there were not marks of violence &s;ufficient to occa&s;ion her death.</P>
<P>I have been in the cu&s;tom of &s;eeing numbers of drowned people who have been brought to the Alms-Hou&s;e, and have often &s;een livid &s;pots of the skin, much &s;uch as I &s;aw in this in&s;tance. I took it to be the effect of &s;uffocation rather than of any thing el&s;e.</P>

<P>Dr. ROMAYNE.&mdash;In an&s;wer to &s;everal que&s;tions put to the witne&s;s, he &s;aid, I can not undertake to give any decided opinion upon appearances without &s;eeing the body. Persons will vary extremely in the accounts they give, as well as in the conclu&s;ions they draw from appearances. The impre&s;&s;ions upon the &s;en&s;es, are
<PB N="79" REF="038372_0077_1011D338AF831218">
in many ca&s;es remarkably nice and cannot be de&s;cribed, from the poverty of language, &s;o as to convey correct ideas to others. An experienced per&s;on of good judg|ment, might perhaps di&s;cover upon in&s;pection, whe|ther brui&s;es made upon the body were done before or after death. A body which had been taken out of the water would a&s;&s;ume a different appearance from what it had at fir&s;t, in ten minutes after it was expo&s;ed, to air, and every day the appearance of injury done, would acquire more vi&s;ibility as it advanced in putre|faction. I have examined many bodies after death, by hanging, and never could di&s;cover that the red colour of the countenance was materially changed from what it was in life, or ju&s;t before &s;udden death. Pre&s;&s;ure upon the veins, &s;o as to interrupt the circula|tion will give a blue or black tint or florid appearance; pre&s;&s;ure upon the arteries is likely to produce palene&s;s.</P>
<P>DOCTOR HOSACK&mdash;Called again.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P> Is there any way in which the te&s;timony we have heard can be reconciled?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P> I think it may in either of two ways. Fir&s;t, the &s;pots might not have been, and I pre&s;ume were not as vi&s;ible at the time the body was fir&s;t taken out of the water, as after it had been expo&s;ed to the air for &s;ome days. This change of color in brui&s;es is not uncommon in the living body, and I pre&s;ume &s;ome what &s;imilar colors may occur by the proce&s;s of putrifaction after death. At fir&s;t there may be very little change of color in the injured part, but, after &s;ome time, it undergoes a very con&s;iderable alteration. Secondly, it occurs to me, that as it was &s;uppo&s;ed that the neck and collar bone were broken, when &s;he was fir&s;t taken out of the well, and as I did not &s;ee her until the day of interment, it is possible that the frequent turning and bending the head and, the frequent examination of the neck to a&s;certain the in|jury
<PB N="80" REF="038372_0078_1011D33C477DD8C0">
done to the collar bone, may have produced the appearances on the neck I before mentioned, e&s;peci|ally as the body had been dead for &s;everal days, and the ve&s;&s;els had become tender; in which ca&s;e, very little violence might have produced an effu&s;ion of blood under the skin. The&s;e circum&s;tances I did not advert to in my examination in the morning, not knowing the injury done to the neck and collar bone, which have been &s;ince related.</P>

<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P> How much water will the lungs take in after death?</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P> Only as much as the windpipe will hold can be received. The lungs collap&s;e at the la&s;t expira|tion, and a very incon&s;iderable quantity of water can be received afterwards. But this I do not a&s;&s;ert from my own knowledge of the &s;tate of the body after death by drowning, but upon the authority of Dr. Coleman, of London, who a&s;&s;erts that he frequently ob&s;erved this fact upon di&s;&s;ection.</P>
<P>After the body has lain a long time under water, it is not unu&s;ual to find water in it.</P>

I was a lodger in the hou&s;e of Mrs. Ring, and was there the night &s;he as mi&s;&s;ing.

while I was bu&s;y in my garden, he came again; now &s;ays he, the thing has all come out, the thing is &s;ettled, there is point blank proof come from the Jer&s;eys of a new fact.

<SPEAKER>EZRA WEEKS,</SPEAKER>
<P>On Sunday the 22d of Decem|ber, my brother Levi came to my hou&s;e about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to Church and left him there, I dined that day at my father-in law's, and did not return home till about 5 o'clock in the after|noon. Ju&s;t as we had drank tea and were yet &s;itting at the table before we lit candles, my brother came in, and I believe in about half an hour afterwards Mr. and Mrs. M'Combs came in, and my brother tarried till about 8 o'clock, whether a little before or a little af|ter I cannot &s;ay. Mr. M'Combs and his wife &s;at about 20 minutes as near as I can judge after my bro|ther went out, I lighted them down &s;tairs and held the candle to light them all the way to Mr. Rhinelander's corner, it being very &s;lippery and dark cautioned them to take care. I came up again, ju&s;t as I &s;it down the candle, before I had time to &s;it down my&s;elf Levi my brother came in to enquire about the bu&s;ine&s;s of the next day, as he had the charge of my &s;hop, un|der&s;tanding the bu&s;ine&s;s as well as my&s;elf, and very attentive to it, I am &s;eldom at the &s;hop more than once a day. I attended to the bu&s;ine&s;s abroad, took dimen&s;ions of work on my memorandum, and gave it to my brother in writing, his bu&s;ine&s;s was to give directions to the journeymen for execution&mdash;Here is eight doors on my memorandum, (producing it to the Court and Jury) of different dimen&s;ions for Mr. James Cumming's hou&s;e, which he took down that evening on a piece of paper as I called them off: he gave directions to the journeymen for their execution&mdash;the doors was made without any mi&s;take, fitted for their de&s;igned places, and without any further direc|tions

from me. It was a general practice of my bro|ther's to call on me of an evening to con&s;ult me about bu&s;ine&s;s of the next day, and if company happened to interfere, if he did not &s;tay till the company was gone, he &s;eldom failed to come in again before he went to bed. That night he came accordingly, he eat a hearty &s;upper, he was as cheerful as ever I &s;aw him, tarried till about 10 o'clock, and I &s;uppo&s;e, went home as u&s;ual.</P>

<P> On the 2d day of January la&s;t, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was &s;itting down to dinner and Levi came and told me that Mrs. Fore&s;t had told him that the muff and handkerchief was found in a well near Bayard's lane, I told him that I &s;uppo&s;ed it mu&s;t be the Manhattan well.</P>

<P> The rea&s;on why the Manhattan well came &s;o fir&s;t to my recollection, was that I had furni&s;hed the wood materials for that well, and as my bu&s;ine&s;s often called me that way I rode pa&s;t the well almo&s;t every day.</P>

I was there about Chri&s;tmas. There was a ru|mour in the &s;hop that Mi&s;s Elma Sands was mi&s;&s;ing. Mr. Levi Weeks then kept the books, and they were kept ju&s;t as well as they had been before, and his con|duct was as u&s;ual.

The di&s;tance by Broad|way and Barley-&s;treet is greater. The la&s;t witne&s;s added, that he had made the experiment to &s;ee in how &s;hort a time a hor&s;e might be drove from Rings' to the Manhattan well, and back again, and found if fif|teen minutes. He gave the pri&s;oner a good character.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;i&s;tant Attorney General addre&s;&s;ed the court a &s;econd time, on the propriety of admitting the expre&s;|&s;ions of the decea&s;ed to be given in evidence. He &s;aid he had no idea of attempting to que&s;tion the former deci&s;ion of the court, but the cau&s;e had now a&s;&s;umed another complexion; it had now been made a point of defence, that the mind of the decea&s;ed was me|lancholy and deranged&mdash;he thought the words as well as the look and behaviour of the decea&s;ed, &s;hould be given in evidence, it being equally an index of the mind and di&s;po&s;ition, and that in his opinion, this was the only way to arrive at truth.</P>
<P>Col. Burr was about to reply, but the Court told him it was unnece&s;&s;ary: they &s;aid the di&s;tinction taken by the A&s;&s;i&s;tant Attorney General, was not &s;uch as to induce them to change their opinion.</P>

<P>Col. Burr, read to the jury, the following pa&s;|&s;ages
<PB N="94" REF="038372_0092_1011D36DEE9523F0">
from Hale's Plea of the Crown, v. II ,p. 289,290.</P>
<P>In some cases presumptive evidences go far to prove a person guilty, tho' there be no express proof of the fact to be committed by him, but then it must be very warily pressed, for it is better five guilty persons should escape unpunished, than one innocent person should die.</P>
<P>If a horse be stolen from A. And the same day B. be found up|on him, it is strong presumption that B. Stole him, yet I do re|member before a very learned and wary judge in such an instance B. Was condemned and executed at Oxford assizes, and yet within two assizes after C. being apprehended for another robbery and con|victed, upon his judgement and execution, confessed he was the man that stole the horse, and being closely pursued desired B. a stranger to walk his horse for him, while he turned aside upon a necessary occasion, and escaped; and B. Was apprehended with the horse, and died innocently.</P>
<P>Another that happened in my remembrance in stadfordshire where A. was long missing, and upon strong presumptions B. was supposed to have murdered him, and to have consumed him to ashes, in an oven, that he should not be found, whereupon B. was in|dicted of murder, and convict and executed, and within one year after A. returned, being indeed sent beyond sea by B. against his will, and so, tho' B. justly deserved death, yet he really was not guilty of the offence for which he suffered.</P>
<P>The coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner, now propo&s;ed to &s;ubmit the cau&s;e to the charge of the Court&mdash;The A&s;&s;i&s;tant Attorney-General wi&s;hed that the Court would adjourn, as they had done the preceding night; he &s;tated that he had not &s;lept &s;ince the morning that the cau&s;e was opened, and had then been without repo&s;e forty-four hours; that he found him&s;elf &s;ink|ing under this fatigue, and con&s;idering that the pri|&s;oner's coun&s;el, who were to precede him would pro|bably take &s;everal hours, it would be morning before he could begin his addre&s;s to the Jury&mdash;that really he had not &s;trength to proceed further that night, and &s;hould therefore be under the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;cent|ing to the propo&s;ition of the other &s;ide, unle&s;s the Court would adjourn&mdash;He was anxious that the
<PB N="95" REF="038372_0093_1011D36F8BA7BFD8">
Court &s;hould do this, becau&s;e he thought it import|ant that the Jury &s;hould hear ob&s;ervations on the te&s;timony.</P>
<P>The Court however, &s;aid it would be too hard to keep the Jury together another night without the conveniencies nece&s;&s;ary to repo&s;e, and they there|fore could not think it proper.</P>
<P><HI>The CHIEF JUSTICE in charging the Jury observed,</HI> That from the manner in which the trial had been conducted, he had been led to &s;uppose that the ar|guments of the coun&s;el would have afforded him &s;uf|ficient time to adju&s;t and arrange the ma&s;s of evidence, which, in its progre&s;s, had been brought into view&mdash;that it had, unexpectedly, became his duty to charge them immediately after the te&s;timony was clo&s;ed&mdash;but that he &s;ubmitted to this with le&s;s reluctance from a per&s;ua&s;ion that a minute detail was not e&s;&s;en|tial to enable them to determine on the ca&s;e accord|ing to its ju&s;tice, as the evidence applying to the points on which it ought to be decided, in his opinion, lay in a &s;mall compa&s;s&mdash;That the que&s;tion they had to decide involved con&s;iderations of great moment, both to the public and the pri&s;oner&mdash;To the public as deeply intere&s;ted in the detection and puni&s;hment of crimes of the atrocious nature of that with which the pri&s;oner was charged&mdash;To the pri&s;oner, as on their verdict depended his life and every thing dear to the human mind&mdash;That the&s;e ob&s;ervations were only pertinent &s;o far as they might operate to &s;timulate their attention and prompt to a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate e&s;timate of the evidence&mdash;but that they ought not to be per|mitted to influence them from pronouncing the result of their inve&s;tigations according to the impre&s;&s;ions they had made on their minds, regardle&s;s, of the con&s;equences attached to their determination&mdash;that
<PB N="96" REF="038372_0094_1011D37431FCA568">
their path of duty was clearly and di&s;tinctly traced for them <HI>to find the pri&s;oner guilty if in their con&s;ciences they believed</HI> him &s;o <HI>from the evidence&mdash;to acquit him if they thought him innocent.</HI>&mdash;That previous to his con&s;idering the nature and effect of the evidence, it might be well to ob&s;erve that this matter had, in a con&s;iderable degree, excited the public attention&mdash;that it had intere&s;ted the pa&s;&s;ions of many, and that a variety of reports re&s;pecting it had been circulated, &s;ome of which mu&s;t, unavoidably, have been com|municated to them&mdash;that by whatever motive prompt|ed, they did not de&s;erve attention, and that they, ought not to have attached to them the lea&s;t con&s;e|quence, or to mingle with the facts di&s;clo&s;ed by the witne&s;&s;es&mdash;that the obligation they had incurred when they became Jurors, limitted them to the evi|dence produced on the trial, and that <HI>that</HI>only could ju&s;tify the verdict they were called upon to give on this occa&s;ion&mdash;that in the ca&s;e it was not pretended that po&s;itive proof of the commi&s;&s;ion of the murder by the pri&s;oner was attainable, but that it had been attempted to prove his guilt by a circum&s;tantial evidence, and that if it could be e&s;tabli&s;hed by a number of circum&s;tances &s;o connected as to produce a rational conviction that he was the perpetrator of the crime, it would be as much their duty to find him guilty, as if it was made out by direct and po&s;itive te&s;timo|ny&mdash;.that there were points in which the circum&s;tances attempted to be combined were not &s;o &s;atisfactorily connected as to enable them to pronounce the pri&s;on|er guilty.&mdash;That it was doubtful whether Gulielma Sands left the hou&s;e of Elias Ring in company with the pri&s;oner &s;o as to impo&s;e it on him to account for the manner in which he had di&s;po&s;ed of her&mdash;that the te&s;timony re&s;pecting the one hor&s;e &s;leigh, did not appear to be &s;uch as to ju&s;tify a pre&s;umption, that

the pri&s;oner had per&s;onally any agency in them, for that if the relation of Su&s;annah Broad did not &s;atis|fy them, that the &s;leigh was taken out of the lumber yard of the pri&s;oner's brother at or about the time Gulielma Sands di&s;appeared, it mu&s;t be evident that the relations of the other witne&s;&s;es re&s;pecting a &s;leigh and the cries of di&s;tre&s;s heard near the Manhattan Well could have no application to the pri&s;oner&mdash;that <HI>Mrs. Broad's</HI> te&s;timony was confu&s;ed as to the time, and indi&s;tinct and un&s;atisfactory as to circum&s;tances&mdash;that the pri&s;oner appeared to be a young man&mdash;that it was fully proved that he had &s;u&s;tained a fair character, and that he was of a mild di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;that it was difficult to di&s;cover what inducement could have actuated him in the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime with which he was charged&mdash;that the declarations made by the pri&s;oner after he became an object of &s;u&s;picion did not appear to be incon&s;i&s;tent with inno|cence&mdash;that the witne&s;&s;es produced on the part of the pri&s;oner had accounted for the manner in which he &s;pent the evening, excepting a few minutes&mdash;that from the account the medical gentlemen, who had been examined, had given of the &s;tate of the Corp&s;e of Gulielma, &s;oon after it was taken out of the Well, it was very doubtful whether &s;he had been expo&s;ed to any other violence than that occa&s;ioned by the drowning&mdash;that intimation had been given in the cour&s;e of the trial, tending to que&s;tion the credibili|ty of &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es&mdash;but that it was not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to examine this point, for admitting all the circum&s;tances related by the witne&s;&s;es on the part of the pro&s;ecution to be &s;tated without any di&s;po&s;ition to di&s;colour them to the prejudice of the pri&s;oner, the court were unanimou&s;ly of opinion that the proof was in&s;ufficient to warrant a verdict again&s;t him, and

that with this general charge they committed the pri&s;oner's ca&s;e to their con&s;ideration.</P>
