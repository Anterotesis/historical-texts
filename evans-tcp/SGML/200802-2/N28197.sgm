<BIBL>II. SAMUEL iii. 38.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;<HI>Know ye not that there is a prince, and a great man fallen, this day, in Israel?</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words were &s;poken by king David, on occa&s;ion of the death of Abner, the commander in chief of the armies of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>The funeral &s;olemnities being completed, the king's friends invited him to partake of an en|tertainment. But he declined it with the &s;o|lemnity of an oath, on account of the afflictive event of the day, and hereby evinced that his &s;orrow was deep and abiding. By far too much &s;o, to be di&s;&s;ipated by the formalities of the funeral; however decent and re&s;pectful to the dead.</P>
<P>Our text &s;ugge&s;ts a weighty rea&s;on for his conduct, and, implicitly, calls on the nation at large, to mingle &s;orrows, and join in lamenting the common lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The likene&s;s of that event to what now calls forth the general tear from every part of the United States, is &s;ufficiently obvious.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>I. We are to &s;hew what con&s;titutes human greatne&s;s, and the means which produce it.</P>
<P>In attending to this branch of our &s;ubject, it mu&s;t be kept in mind, that greatne&s;s, when ap|plied to man, is not to be under&s;tood in an ab&s;o|lute, but in a compartaive &s;en&s;e. Men who are great, when compared with mo&s;t of their fellow men, are little, in compari&s;on with created be|ings of higher orders.&mdash;How little when compa|red with the boundle&s;s &s;ource of all created ex|i&s;tences! In this compari&s;on, the mo&s;t exalted creature, is like the &s;mall du&s;t of the balance. Yea even le&s;s than nothing and vanity!</P>
<P>With this, impre&s;&s;ed on our hearts, we name the following things as con&s;tituting human greatne&s;s, and compri&s;ing the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential means to its production.</P>
<P>In general it may be defined, a &s;ufficiency for a cour&s;e of great and good actions, and the ex|hibition
<PB N="7" REF="037587_0005_100EE0A0D572BCE8">
of them, through a &s;eries of trials and dangers. We &s;peak of great and <HI>good</HI> actions, becau&s;e no character can be truly great, what|ever productions of power, and of under&s;tand|ing it may exhibit, if they are not good. We contemplate, with aver&s;ion and terror, a Being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great abilities without the will to do good. Great qualities are in no view de&s;i|rable, excepting as the requi&s;ite means of pro|ducing exten&s;ive good, and, con&s;equently, they cea&s;e to be objects of e&s;teem and admiration, when not thus applied.</P>
<P>By <HI>good</HI> actions we mean tho&s;e which are de|&s;igned and adapted for the promotion of human happine&s;s, in &s;ub&s;ervience to the be&s;t intere&s;ts of the moral &s;y&s;tem. Not a &s;ingle action, but <HI>a course</HI> of &s;uch actions, con&s;titute a great charac|ter. Becau&s;e, one &s;ingle action may have the &s;emblance of a great exertion of virtuous benev|olence, to the imperfect and &s;uperficial view of man; and may, however, be educed from prin|ciples which are wholly the rever&s;e. But this can, &s;carcely, be &s;uppo&s;ed, in the ca&s;e of a cour&s;e, or long continued &s;eries of actions ap|parently great and good. We can, indeed, form no conception of <HI>good actions,</HI> except from their apparent de&s;ign and tendency.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e actions which are apparently de&s;igned and adapted directly to promote the happine&s;s of a particular circle of rational beings, and to coincide with that of univer&s;al exi&s;tence, we pronounce to be good, and tho&s;e of an oppo&s;ite tendency we con&s;ider as evil.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="037587_0006_100EE0A2ADFBAEC8">
A di&s;tinction mu&s;t be pre&s;erved in our minds between a <HI>good</HI> character, and one which is great; a per&s;on of &s;mall abilities, in the mo&s;t private walk of life, may uniformly aim to do good, and may merit and po&s;&s;e&s;s the character of a <HI>good man,</HI> with tho&s;e who know him, but he will never be called great.&mdash;Thus it appears that to con&s;titute a great man, there mu&s;t be a &s;ufficiency for a cour&s;e of great and good actions, and the exhibition of them, through a &s;eries of trials and dangers.&mdash;We mention this la&s;t cir|cum&s;tance becau&s;e per&s;everance in a cour&s;e of good conduct through &s;uch a &s;eries, gives much additional evidence of inward &s;incerity, and un&s;haken re&s;olution.</P>
<P>A &s;ufficiency for &s;uch a cour&s;e of action is to be under&s;tood with the limitation nece&s;&s;ary, when applied to all created agents, who are e|qually, and ab&s;olutely dependent on the will and power of the great Creator. By this &s;ufficien|cy, we therefore mean tho&s;e abilities, means, opportunities, and di&s;po&s;itions, which God be|&s;tows on tho&s;e whom he de&s;igns to make truly great.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being premi&s;ed, we proceed to name the following means, or requi&s;ites of hu|man greatne&s;s.</P>
<P N="1">1. Good natural abilities are e&s;&s;ential to the formation of a great character. That the origi|nal capacities of men are extremely diver&s;e, is obvious, however this diver&s;ity is to be account|ed for. It is immaterial, to our pre&s;ent enqui|ry, whether it con&s;i&s;ts in the original con&s;titu|tion of different minds, or is the re&s;ult of con|nection
<PB N="9" REF="037587_0007_100EE0A4F317C1F8">
with different bodies. That a wide and important difference exi&s;ts, will be admitted. Some men are evidently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of powers a|dapted to important &s;tations, and great actions. Such minds readily expand in the field of know|ledge, and have a happy talent in its application.&mdash;Others may, indeed, appear to have genius for learning, and become &s;cientific men. But the genius adapted to form a great man, pur&s;ues practical knowledge, and applies it to great ac|tions, and without an original capacity of this de&s;cription, all attempts for human greatne&s;s will be vain.</P>
<P N="2">2. Good means for improvement are nece&s;&s;a|ry to form a great man. The progre&s;s of the mind, like that of animal and vegetable life, is effected by means. Proper cultivation expands the mental powers and qualifies the man for great and worthy exertions. Much is effected to this object by the wi&s;e le&s;&s;ons of parental in|&s;truction, by lenient and &s;teady government, and direction of the unformed principles and manners of childhood and youth.&mdash;The know|ledge of books, and men, is highly important, and e&s;pecially the force of good example. Without the&s;e and other &s;imilar means of im|provement, the mo&s;t promi&s;ing natural abilities may be buried in ob&s;curity, and be lo&s;t to po&s;|terity, and to the world.</P>
<P>An appeal to the &s;tate of individuals and of &s;ociety, under the different degrees of improve|ment will exhibit a di&s;tinction between the man of learning and improvement, in cultivated &s;o|ciety and the mere man of nature, the untutor|ed
<PB N="10" REF="037587_0008_100EE0A6CD29C810">
&s;avage, in many re&s;pects not le&s;s &s;triking, than between that &s;avage and the mo&s;t &s;agacious of brute animals.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another requi&s;ite to human greatne&s;s is a diligent and per&s;evering improvement of the means to excel.</P>
<P>Nothing is more evident than that the be&s;t a|bilities and means to form a great man, will utterly fail, unle&s;s the&s;e abilities are exerted, and the means improved.</P>
<P>The human mind is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of original, or innate perceptions, knowledge mu&s;t be ac|quired. A &s;uperior capacity for its reception con&s;titutes the primary greatne&s;s of man; but that capacity unapplied will avail nothing, and means not improved will leave the &s;oul empty. The diligent hand maketh rich, but idlene&s;s brings poverty no le&s;s in re&s;pect to the improve|ments of the mind, than of property. This is a &s;tated law of our nature; e&s;tabli&s;hed by its wi&s;e and beneficent Author. Experience and ob&s;ervation agree with this remark; and the general hi&s;tory of mankind is adapted to con|firm it.</P>
<P N="4">4. A noble ardor of mind for great and good ac|tions. This is not to be found in every wi&s;e man. A certain ab&s;ence of the &s;pirit of exertion, and an immoderate love of ea&s;e and indulgence, have prevented many per&s;ons of re&s;pectable abilities and improvements from effecting any thing con|&s;iderable, either great or good. Great minds, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the ardor which has been mentioned, are far from indifference in the tendency of their actions, and their effects on &s;ociety.&mdash;De&s;titute
<PB N="11" REF="037587_0009_100EE0A8CD7269D0">
of public affection, and governed by private con&s;iderations, their apparent intere&s;ts may inter|fere with that of the public, and they may be|come its mo&s;t dangerous enemies. But influen|ced by a noble regard to the public, and pla|cing their own felicity in the common good, their ardent &s;pirit of enterprize will be employ|ed to promote it.</P>
<P>They embrace an object truly great, and of immen&s;e value. The mind is filled with its weight and importance, and every power is em|ployed to obtain it.</P>
<P N="5">5. Opportunity and occa&s;ion for great and good actions mu&s;t be given, to form the charac|ter of a great man.</P>
<P>Without the&s;e the be&s;t abilities and improve|ments, connected with an ardent de&s;ire to do good, might never effect any thing very intere&s;t|ing and important.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation will be illu&s;trated and con|firmed by reviewing the accounts of Noah, A|braham, Jo&s;eph, Mo&s;es, David, Jo&s;iah, the apo&s;|tle Paul, and other worthies, in &s;cripture hi&s;to|ry, and tho&s;e of the famed &s;ages, and other great men, of ancient and modern times, in the writings of profane authors, or of &s;uch as have appeared in our day.</P>
<P>The deluge, to which the old world was right|eou&s;ly doomed, gave opportunity and occa&s;ion for tho&s;e great and good actions in Noah, which have perpetuated his name, and "by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is by faith." And &s;imilar ob&s;ervations might be made in regard to the re&s;t.
<PB N="12" REF="037587_0010_100EE0AA982BF148">
It is not improbable that abilities as great and hearts as good may have exi&s;ted in the private walks of life, which with equal advantages and opportunities, would have merited equal rank in the annals of fame, with tho&s;e great men whom we ju&s;tly celebrate.</P>
<P>Even our WASHINGTON, whom we place a|mong the fir&s;t in human greatne&s;s, had the Ame|rican revolutionary war, and con&s;equent inde|pendence, not exi&s;ted, would he have merited or enjoyed that high di&s;tinction to which he now has an indi&s;putable claim!</P>
<P N="6">6. Invincible fortitude and per&s;everance, are nece&s;&s;ary to form a great character.</P>
<P>In a cour&s;e of great and good actions, there is much labor, vigilance and care. There are many ob&s;tacles to be &s;urmounted, difficulties, and dangers to be encountered, and di&s;courage|ments to be &s;u&s;tained. The pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s is often clouded, and the be&s;t and mo&s;t labored exertions for the public good are mi&s;repre&s;ent|ed and cen&s;ured.</P>
<P>In circum&s;tances like the&s;e, men of but a common &s;hare of re&s;olution and firmne&s;s, will be di&s;couraged, and never arrive to human greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of invincible fortitude and per&s;everance, to form a great man&mdash;The candidate for this mu&s;t deliberately count the co&s;t, at &s;etting out, and in view of the many di&s;couragements in his way, mu&s;t find that worth and importance in the object of pur&s;uit, which out-weigh them all, and which prepares
<PB N="13" REF="037587_0011_100EE0ACA947A080">
him to &s;acrifice every thing for its &s;ake. The man who places his highe&s;t enjoyment in human happine&s;s, and the highe&s;t perfection of the mo|ral &s;y&s;tem, and who re&s;ts in the unwavering faith of the univer&s;al and perfect government of the exalted Redeemer, can feel commanding inducements to engage in the mo&s;t painful and hazardous enterprizes, for the public good. Amid&s;t the uncertainties of futurity, in regard to him&s;elf, he is a&s;&s;ured that, as it re&s;pects the object of his chief concern, all will be or|dered well, and the final i&s;&s;ue will be good. Hence, under the impre&s;&s;ion of the perfection of divine &s;uperintendance, in application to all events, he is confident in God. He re&s;olves with deliberation, and executes with undaunted courage and per&s;everance.&mdash;From the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed law of Heaven, &s;uch fortitude and re&s;olution make the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. Other particulars might be named, as influencing to form a great character, but they would be found to be involved in tho&s;e already mentioned, or connected with them.</P>
<P>To the &s;uperficial view of man, it is indeed requi&s;ite that, to form a great character, a cour&s;e of great and good actions &s;hould be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. But this is not to judge from a direct view of the nature and tendency of actions, but from other events, and tho&s;e not certainly connected with the actions. Al&s;o the ultimate and mo&s;t important con&s;equences of great and good actions, are often beyond the extent of human view, and wrapped up in futu|rity. Hence the judgement of the quality of actions, formed on their pre&s;ent and vi&s;ible con|&s;equences is very uncertain, and in many in&s;tan|ces
<PB N="14" REF="037587_0012_100EE0AE8B95BE78">
the events which we con&s;ider as the con&s;e|quences of particular actions, might, with more ju&s;tice, be educed from other, and very dif|ferent cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being obvious, it follows that, however nece&s;&s;ary for us it may be to judge of characters, in part, by the apparent con&s;equen|ces of actions, the rule is imperfect, and we are liable to err.&mdash;To the all-&s;eeing mind, each ac|tion and character, in it&s;elf, is open to view, and the truly great man, is clearly di&s;cerned and approved, according to the nature and tendency of his actions, with whatever effects we may view them as connected. In the final adju&s;t|ment of things in the moral &s;y&s;tem, every great and good action and character will appear in its true light, and the ultimate con&s;equences of &s;uch actions will appear to be good. Then the wi&s;e, and the righteous, all the great and good, "&s;hall &s;hine forth as the &s;on in the kingdom of their father."</P>
<P>II. Our next object is to trace human great|ne&s;s to its divine Author.</P>
<P>The ab&s;olute dependence of creatures on their Creator, is &s;o obvious to rea&s;on, and that "ev|ery good gift cometh down from the father of lights," is &s;o clearly taught in the holy &s;crip|tures, and is, on the whole, a truth &s;o nearly &s;elf evident, that it is difficult to render it plain|er, or more certain by argument. In&s;en&s;ibility of this truth is not the fault of the under&s;tand|ing, but of the heart.</P>
<P>Human greatne&s;s we have &s;hown to be the re&s;ult of good natural abilities&mdash;placed under
<PB N="15" REF="037587_0013_100EE0B0B5594D88">
good means for improvement&mdash;a diligent and per&s;evering u&s;e of tho&s;e means&mdash;a noble ardor of mind for great and good actions&mdash;opportunity and occa&s;ion for their production&mdash;and invinci|ble fortitude and per&s;everance in a cour&s;e of &s;uch actions.</P>
<P>Is there any one of the&s;e which is not the gift of God? However manife&s;t it is that men are generally in&s;en&s;ible of the invi&s;ible hand which &s;upports them in life, and might be addre&s;|&s;ed in the divine language to Cyrus, "I girded thee, though thou ha&s;t not known me." Yet few will que&s;tion the truth of the doctrine. A deep and abiding impre&s;&s;ion of it on our hearts is highly important in the general concerns of human life, and e&s;pecially in the formation of a great and good character. Without this, all fancied human greatne&s;s will vani&s;h in the light of Divine truth, as the mi&s;t before the ri&s;ing &s;un.</P>
<P>III. We proceed to con&s;ider the ends of Di|vine wi&s;dom in rai&s;ing up great men.</P>
<P>We may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that infinite wi&s;|dom has many particular objects to accompli&s;h by &s;uch events, beyond the extent of human comprehen&s;ion. In the divine operation, many ends are accompli&s;hed by one work, in ours, the rever&s;e is true. Many works are nece&s;&s;ary for the accompli&s;hment of one end. We men|tion, however, the following particulars, as be|ing evidently compri&s;ed in the divine plan, in rai&s;ing up great men.</P>
<P N="1">1. The benefit of the &s;ubject. God is the fa|ther of the whole creation, "His goodne&s;s is
<PB N="16" REF="037587_0014_100EE0B254967648">
over all his works," "He doth good to the evil and unthankful, He cau&s;es his &s;un to ri&s;e, and his rain to de&s;cend, on the evil and the good." But tho&s;e on whom he has be&s;towed uncommon talents, and who faithfully improve them, are the objects of his peculiar care. To the&s;e he gives the unrivalled plea&s;ure of doing good, and honors them with a great reward. He treats them as his own children. He be&s;tows on them the marks of his peculiar favor. He gives them to &s;ee the fruit of their labor, in the felicity of his kingdom, and to be &s;till u&s;eful, and to rejoice forever in his love.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another end of God, in rai&s;ing up great men, is the good of &s;ociety. From the genuine con&s;equences of the works of God, we may infer his de&s;igns, becau&s;e we know He is never di&s;ap|pointed. In every ca&s;e, his council will &s;tand, and he will do all his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But nothing is more evident than that under God, the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety are pre&s;erved and advanced by the labors of great men, qualified, and promoted to places of eminence, by God, for this end. Such pre&s;erve the &s;tate from im|pending ruin, defend it from enemies, &s;ecure its intere&s;ts, and advance its pro&s;perity. They are in&s;trumental in giving complexion to the princi|ples and manners of the people at large, of bringing many ble&s;&s;ings to their own generation, and conveying them to the children of future times. "Wo to thee O Land when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning. Ble&s;&s;ed art thou O land when thy king is the &s;on of nobles, and thy princes eat in due &s;ea&s;on, for &s;trength and not for drunkenne&s;s."</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="17" REF="037587_0015_100EE0B42044E128">
3. The benefit of the church of God is anoth|er object of Divine wi&s;dom, in rai&s;ing up great men.&mdash;The truth and importance of this ob&s;erv|ation are evident from the repre&s;entations of holy &s;cripture, importing that the complete &s;al|vation of the redeemed church is a leading ob|ject in all divine operations, and that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is exalted to be "head over all things to the church."&mdash;It is evident from the hi&s;tory of the wi&s;e and good of all ages. The&s;e have devoted their lives to &s;erve the be&s;t intere&s;ts of the church of God. For this, Mo&s;es and Jo&s;hua, Samuel, and David, lived, labored and &s;uffered.&mdash;This has engaged prophets, apo&s;tles, and right|eous men of all ages, and nations. For this, they have prayed, labored, and &s;uffered, and gi|ven their names to reproach, and their lives to death.&mdash;We add</P>
<P N="4">4. Great men are rai&s;ed up for the purpo&s;es which have been named, that hereby there might be a proper di&s;play of all divine perfections, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in all worlds, throughout all ages, to the prai&s;e and glory of God, forev|er.&mdash;This is the apo&s;tolic doctrine to the church at Corinth, and, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, to every chri&s;tian church and individual.</P>
<P>"All things are for your &s;akes, that the abun|dant grace, through the thank&s;giving of many, might redound to the glory of God"&mdash;In this we &s;ee a concatenation of objects, the mo&s;t de&s;irable and important, in which al&s;o the le&s;s is &s;ubordi|nate to the greater, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and all ab&s;orb|ed in the expre&s;&s;ion of Divine fulne&s;s, and the everla&s;ting glory of God.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="037587_0016_100EE0B5EB8BFEB8">
IV. Our next enquiry re&s;pects the manner in which a people &s;hould receive and improve &s;o &s;ingular a favor from God as the be&s;towment of great men.</P>
<P N="1">1. We an&s;wer briefly, they &s;hould be received with unfeigned gratitude to God, the giver. With expre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch gratitude the &s;criptures abound, we adduce but one. It is the thank&s;|giving of king David, near the clo&s;e of life, in a review of the great things which God had done for him and his people.</P>
<P>David ble&s;&s;ed the Lord before all the con|gregation, and David &s;aid, ble&s;&s;ed be thou, Lord God of I&s;rael, our father, forever and ever. Thine O Lord is the greatne&s;s, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the maje&s;ty, for all that is in the heaven and the earth is thine. Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art ex|alted as head above all. Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou reigne&s;t over all, and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give &s;trength unto all. Now therefore, our God we thank and prai&s;e thy glorious name. [1 <HI>Chron.</HI> XXIX. 10, 11, 12, 13.]</P>

<P>V. We proceed to apply the &s;ubject to the pre&s;ent &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>That a great man is fallen in our land, is the unanimous voice of that &s;olemn &s;adne&s;s which pervades the union.</P>
<P>To pre&s;ent him truly to the pre&s;ent, and fu|ture generations, will be the honorable, but ar|duous ta&s;k of the hi&s;torian. The recollection, however, of the following &s;ketches, &s;eems to be due to his memory at this time.</P>
<P>He was born on the 11th of February 1732. Though de&s;cended from re&s;pectable parents, his &s;ame re&s;ts not on the merit of his progenitors. By the death of his elde&s;t brother, he came to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the family e&s;tate, which was ample, and might, perhaps, have influence to bring him more early into public view. Hav|ing completed his education, under a dome&s;tic tutor, agreeably to the cu&s;tom in that part of the country. About the age of twenty-one, he was intru&s;ted with public bu&s;ine&s;s, by the govern|ment, important in its con&s;equences, and attend|ed with much danger. This he executed to the &s;atisfaction of his employers. The following year (1754) he was appointed to the command
<PB N="20" REF="037587_0018_100EE0BA1C5C0668">
of a po&s;t, near the &s;pot of ground where the town of Pitt&s;burgh now &s;tands. Attacked in this po&s;ition by a va&s;tly &s;uperior force of the enemy, after his ammunition was nearly exhau&s;ted, he extricated him&s;elf and his little army, from this perilous &s;ituation, in a manner which did him great honor.&mdash;In the year 1755, he marched with his regiment, under General Braddock, to attack the French who had occupied the po&s;t ju&s;t mentioned, and were in force, and after the de|feat and death of that unfortunate General, he &s;aved the remainder of the army, with great mil|itary addre&s;s.</P>
<P>About this time he was marked out, in a pub|lic di&s;cour&s;e, by &s;omething like a prophetic &s;pirit, as the future &s;upport, and &s;aviour of his country.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See Pre&s;ident DAVIES' &s;ermon on religion and patrioti&s;m, addre&s;&s;ed to Capt. OVERTON's Independent Company of Volunteers, Hanover county, Virginia, Aug. 17, 1755.</NOTE></P>
<P>After the peace of 1763, the field for military achievments was not open. But on the com|mencement of our troubles with Great-Britain, he was a repre&s;entative in Congre&s;s in the year 1774, and 5, and when a deci&s;ion of the di&s;|pute, by an appeal to arms, became inevitable, he was appointed by congre&s;s to the chief com|mand of the forces rai&s;ed, and to be rai&s;ed, for our defence. The dignified mode&s;ty with which he accepted this appointment, was a pledge of that fidelity, wi&s;dom and fortitude, which mark|ed his official conduct through the war.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory will relate the events of this arduous conflict, and the numerous and unequalled diffi|culties, hazards and di&s;couragements, which he had to encounter, and the un&s;haken fortitude
<PB N="21" REF="037587_0019_100EE0BC28ACEEF0">
with which he &s;u&s;tained them, till eight revolv|ing years of di&s;tre&s;s and &s;laughter, endured with unabating firmne&s;s by our army, and our citizens, and the &s;ubjection of two Briti&s;h armies by our forces, induced the government of Great-Britain to de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s, and agree on terms of an honorable peace.</P>
<P>The treaty of peace being ratified, we next find our beloved General bidding an affectionate farewell to his army, fraught with &s;alutary and &s;ea&s;onable coun&s;els, which did great honor to his under&s;tanding, but &s;till more to his heart. Ha|ving di&s;banded the army, he appeared before the Pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s, in a full &s;e&s;&s;ion of the mem|bers, and with a &s;olemn and affectionate dignity, which admits not of de&s;cription, but which no|ble minds can feel, he re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion to the pre&s;ident; and retired, as a private man to his &s;eat at Mount Vernon, there de&s;igning to &s;pend the remainder of his days in &s;weet retire|ment, and the pure joys of dome&s;tic harmony.</P>
<P>The public exigencies however &s;oon called him from his beloved retirement, and we find him pre&s;iding in the convention of 1787, which formed the happy con&s;titution of our general go|vernment. When that con&s;titution appeared and was adopted, the eyes and hearts of the friends of order, through the union, were fixed on WASHINGTON, to pre&s;ide in the new government. He was accordingly elected, without a di&s;&s;enting voice. Having determined to accept the ap|pointment, he left his beloved retirement, in the &s;pring of the year 1789, and proceeded to New-York, where Congre&s;s was convened. The ex|pre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="22" REF="037587_0020_100EE0BE05D5CE10">
of re&s;pect which were paid him by all cla&s;&s;es, in the various places through which he pa&s;&s;ed were unequalled. Among which tho&s;e at the bridge of Trenton will be long remembered.</P>
<P>When he arrived at New-York, and offered him&s;elf to receive the legal qualifications of his high office, the &s;cene was unutterably mov|ing. In an open gallery, in the view of many thou&s;ands of admiring &s;pectators, the Pre&s;ident advanced with a &s;low and &s;olemn pace, laid his hand on the holy volume, and &s;wore to the faith|ful di&s;charge of his high office, while the tears of uncorrupted patrioti&s;m plentifully watered his venerable cheeks. A general acclamation of the joyous &s;pectators &s;ucceeded. Had not the irre&s;i&s;|tible flow of the tender pa&s;&s;ions precluded utter|ance in many, it would have been univer&s;al.</P>
<P>Having filled the office of Pre&s;ident of the U|nited States, for the con&s;titutional term of four years, he reluctantly accepted a &s;econd unani|mous election to the office, which he filled, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;econd time, with no le&s;s wi&s;dom and philan|thropy than the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Previous to a third election, he publi&s;hed his re&s;ignation, his fixed purpo&s;e of retirement, and la&s;t advice to the citizens of the United States, full of patrioti&s;m, full of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>In 1798, the exigencies of the public calling for his aid, he was appointed, by Pre&s;ident A|dams, to the command of the armies of the Uni|ted States. Which appointment he accepted, as he had all others, as a gratuitous &s;ervice to his country, and added another proof to the many
<PB N="23" REF="037587_0021_100EE0BFAFB516C8">
already given, of the purity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of his patrioti&s;m. The happy influence, on the public mind, of this la&s;t te&s;timony of affection to his country, is fre&s;h in your memory.</P>
<P>With painful &s;en&s;ibility I clo&s;e this narration with relating, that, on the 14th of December 1799, at 11 o'clock at night, after an illne&s;s of 24 hours only, this man of incalculable worth, was removed from us forever.&mdash;He died as he had lived.&mdash;He re&s;igned his breath with the &s;er|enity becoming a great and good man.</P>
<P>VI. It now remains that we &s;ugge&s;t a few thoughts on the improvement to be made of the mournful event we are contemplating.</P>
<P N="1">1. We are called to humble thank&s;giving to the God of grace who rai&s;ed up this great man in our land, at &s;uch a time, and endued him with tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed accompli&s;hments, which furni&s;hed him for the important part, he was called to act, in the American revolutionary war, and in the &s;ub&s;equent events.&mdash;That wi&s;|dom more than human, and integrity incorrup|tible, marked his path, has been often ob&s;erved. It has been the opinion of many wi&s;e heathens, that eminently wi&s;e and good men were the pe|culiar care of heaven. The holy &s;criptures a|bundantly &s;upport this &s;entiment.&mdash;In our WASH|INGTON it is illu&s;trated and confirmed.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ervation of a life &s;o important, through &s;o many dangers, to &s;o late a period, is a wonder of divine mercy to be ever remem|bered and gratefully acknowledged. His influ|ence on our army to prevent it from di&s;banding,
<PB N="24" REF="037587_0022_100EE0C143010330">
in &s;ea&s;ons of extreme di&s;tre&s;s and irritation, and his &s;ucce&s;sful exertions in the introduction of that con&s;titution of government, which is the &s;alva|tion of our country, as well as the wi&s;dom, rec|titude, and &s;ucce&s;s, of his admini&s;tration, as Pre|&s;ident, were of God, and to Him be the glory.</P>
<P>Great will be the influence connected with the character and example of the fir&s;t Pre&s;ident of the United States. What man of worth, and de&s;i|rous of hone&s;t &s;ame, who &s;hall &s;ucceed him, will have the boldne&s;s to counteract the &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration which he adopted?</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us &s;ubmit with the deepe&s;t humility to the righteous &s;troke of God's anger, in this mourn|ful event.</P>
<P>God is righteous, He has puni&s;hed us far le&s;s than our iniquities de&s;erve. It becomes us to accept the puni&s;hment of our &s;ins, and by deep repentance, and humble &s;upplication, to &s;eek his favor on our land, on our government, and e&s;|pecially on the Pre&s;ident of the United States. In celebrating the virtues and achievments of WASHINGTON, we are not to be in&s;en&s;ible, or un|mindful of the good hand of our God on us, in giving him a &s;ucce&s;&s;or who&s;e abilities and virtues do honor to his office, and promi&s;e much good to the United States.</P>
<P>Let us unite in humble &s;upplication to the throne of grace that much of the &s;pirit of Elijah may re&s;t on Eli&s;ha, and that our union may be ble&s;&s;ed with an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Pre&s;idents, each of whom, in abilities, virtues, fi|delity and &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hall be a WASHINGTON.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="25" REF="037587_0023_100EE0C356DE7E00">
3. We are loudly called to &s;tand in our lot for the &s;upport of our happy con&s;titution, and the pre&s;ent wi&s;e and good admini&s;tration of go|vernment.</P>
<P>Great are the pro&s;pects of the American Re|public. But it has many adver&s;aries in its own bo&s;om, and &s;till more in Europe. French philo|&s;ophy, athei&s;m, and di&s;organization, will exert their utmo&s;t, to effect the pro&s;tration of our reli|gion, and the demolition of our order and gov|ernment.</P>
<P>Our Republic is yet new; it is far from having attained the &s;tability of riper years. And the&s;e &s;ons of Zeruiah will be too hard for us, if we &s;lumber over the ine&s;timable tru&s;t committed to us by Heaven.</P>
<P>Unle&s;s the Lord be on our &s;ide, when men of this de&s;cription ri&s;e up again&s;t us, they will &s;wal|low us up quick. But through him they &s;hall be di&s;appointed. The &s;nare &s;hall be broken and our &s;ouls delivered. Let us ever commit the United States to the guardian&s;hip of Him, who never &s;lumbereth nor &s;leepeth. And let us di|ligently teach our children to fear and &s;erve him, to imbibe the principles of true religion, order, morality and good government; to prac|ti&s;e them all their days, and tran&s;mit them to their children, that the generations to come, may be wi&s;e and happy; and that religion, and good order may flouri&s;h in the American Repub|lic to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="26" REF="037587_0026_100EE0C5699C5030">
4. Our &s;ubject teaches us the vanity of man as mortal, and our great concern, to be prepa|red for death and to meet the retributions of eternity.</P>
<P>If wi&s;dom, honor, greatne&s;s and worth, united, will not deliver from death. If there is no di&s;|charge in this war, we are taught not to "put our tru&s;t in princes, nor in the &s;on of man, in whom there is no help." But in the living God. Let us commit our&s;elves, our families, and our country, to his gracious protection and guid|ance. Let us &s;erve our generation by the will of God. And let us unite in thankful prai&s;es to the God of all grace, that although our fathers are dead, and WASHINGTON, our friend, our protector is dead, yet Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Almighty Redeemer &s;till lives, and &s;hall never die. But is the &s;ame ye&s;terday, and to day, and forever,&mdash;AMEN.</P>
