<Q><BIBL>I SAMUEL, XXV.I.</BIBL>
<P>And Samuel died; and all the I&s;raelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his hou&s;e at Ramah.&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE have here but a &s;hort account of <HI>Samuel</HI>'s death and burial. Though he was a great man, and one that was admirably well qualified for public &s;ervice, yet he &s;pent the latter end of his days in retirement and ob&s;cu|rity: not becau&s;e he was &s;uperannuated, for he knew how to pre&s;ide in a college of the pro|phets; but becau&s;e I&s;rael had rejected him, for which God cha&s;ti&s;ed them, and becau&s;e his de&s;ire was to be quiet, and to enjoy him&s;elf and his God in acts of devotion in his advanced years.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> All I&s;rael lamented him: and they had rea&s;on; for they all found their lo&s;s in lo&s;ing him. His per&s;onal merit commanded this honour to be done unto him at his death &mdash;his former &s;ervices to the public, while he
<PB N="4" REF="038551_0004_101257F0C8BB1798">
pre&s;ided over I&s;rael, made a re&s;pect to his name and memory a ju&s;t debt: it had been very ungrateful to have withheld it. <HI>Samuel</HI> was a con&s;tant interce&s;&s;or for I&s;rael, he prayed daily for them: if he is gone they have lo&s;t the be&s;t friend they have. The lo&s;s is the more grievous, at this juncture, becau&s;e Saul was &s;o outrageous: never was Samuel more wanted than now; yet now he is removed. We will hope the I&s;raelites lamented Samuel's death the more bitterly, becau&s;e they remembered again&s;t them&s;elves their own &s;in and folly in rejecting him. Tho&s;e have hard hearts, who can bury their own mini&s;ters, and GOD's faith|ful &s;ervants, with dry eyes; that are not &s;en&s;ible of the lo&s;s of tho&s;e who, under GOD, have been their deliverers.</P>
<P>They buried him:&mdash;not in the &s;chool of the prophets; but in his own hou&s;e, perhaps in his garden pertaining to it at Ramah, where he was born. Thus ended the life of that great man; but his GOD would not left his &s;ervant's name he buried with his mortal part: as &s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t&mdash;
<Q><L>The &s;weet remembrance of the ju&s;t,</L>
<L>Shall flouri&s;h when he &s;leeps in du&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="038551_0005_101257F38F8311C0">Brethren, I have cho&s;en the words of our Text, on the pre&s;ent mournful occa&s;ion, becau&s;e there is &s;uch a &s;imilarity between the beloved <HI>Samuel,</HI> and the beloved <HI>Wa&s;hington;</HI> both the &s;ervants of God&mdash;both the gifts of God to his beloved, though &s;inful, people&mdash;both, under God, the &s;aviours of their country&mdash;both the envy of kings, and &s;courge of tyrants&mdash;both beloved of the people in general in their lives, and both univer&s;ally lamented in their deaths. And O! with what propriety did I&s;rael la|ment the death of their beloved <HI>Samuel:</HI> he was the father of their Country, their friend, and the kind gift of their covenant God. And how much rea&s;on have the people of America to lament the death of their beloved <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> who was equally the gift of God to them, as <HI>Samuel</HI> to the I&s;raelites. But as I have &s;aid there was a &s;imilarity, between the&s;e two great characters, it &s;hall be my bu&s;ine&s;s, on this mournful occa&s;ion, to &s;et forth that &s;imilarity.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t, Samuel,</HI> in his early age, was found active in the cau&s;e of God, which no doubt, was the &s;alvation of I&s;rael. In like manner, General <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> early in life, in the we&s;tern
<PB N="6" REF="038551_0006_101257F6083FE870">
country, applied him&s;elf to the military pro|fe&s;&s;ion in the defence of his country, which no doubt was the cau&s;e of GOD, and terminated in the &s;alvation of GOD's American I&s;rael.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is remarkable that we have no more of <HI>Samuel</HI> from the time the Lord called him, while he dwelt in the hou&s;e of Eli, until his country was be&s;ieged by the Phili&s;tines, which was a &s;pace of 20 years&mdash;then, in the time of danger, this great man &s;teps forth, and gathered together all I&s;rael to Mizpeh: there he prayed for them, and with them&mdash;there he coun&s;elled and advi&s;ed them, and by his prudent advi&s;e, the men of I&s;rael went out of Mizpeh, and pur&s;ued the enemy, and &s;mote them, (&s;aith the text) until they came unto Bethcar, 1 Sam. vii.11. So the Phili&s;tines were &s;ubdued, and they came no more into the coa&s;ts of I&s;rael; and the hand of the LORD, was again&s;t the Phili&s;tines all the days of <HI>Samuel,</HI> ver&s;e 13.</P>
<P><HI>Simile.</HI> In like manner, nothing material was heard of the great and good <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> after the We&s;tern Expedition, until his American I&s;rael was in the utmo&s;t danger of being deprived of their precious Liberty. Then our illu&s;trious Hero &s;teps forth, in the day
<PB N="7" REF="038551_0007_101257F7A0F48DD0">
of danger, in defence of our liberties and our lives, of our wives and of our children, and all that was dear to us. And after the example of his adorable Lord and ma&s;ter, the LORD JESUS CHRIST, he counted not his life dear unto him&s;elf; but ventured both life and fortune for the &s;ake of his country. It was not filthy lucre that moved the great, the memo|rable <HI>Wa&s;hington;</HI> for he received no pay. No, &s;irs, it was <HI>Dei Gratia,</HI> or the grace of GOD, in his noble heart, that moved him in all his heroic actions; and the power of Almighty GOD, that gave his &s;ervant <HI>Wa&s;hing|ton</HI> &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the mo&s;t powerful and well di&s;ciplined army upon earth.</P>
<P>How blind mu&s;t that man be, that &s;ees not the hand of Almighty GOD with the Sword of <HI>Wa&s;hington.</HI> It might be &s;aid with propriety, as of old it was of Gideon, "The &s;word of the Lord and of Gideon;" &s;o we may &s;ay, The &s;word of the Lord and of <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> has made us the mo&s;t free and happy people on earth: and though we lament this day the death of our dear <HI>Wa&s;hington;</HI> yet we have rea&s;on, great rea&s;on, to rejoice, that the GOD of General <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> lives&mdash;ever lives, and is our GOD
<PB N="8" REF="038551_0008_101257FA1967A598">
&mdash;and who, I tru&s;t, will protect us and ble&s;s us forever. Let us not, therefore, my brother officers and fellow citizens, "&s;orrow as men without hope" for them that &s;leep in him. For them that &s;leep in CHRIST will GOD bring with him. It is right our beloved <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> &s;hould "re&s;t from his labors, and his works follow him." Our eternal Father has called home the Father of our country &mdash;not to re&s;t at Mount <HI>Vernon,</HI> where his re&s;t has been frequently interrupted by the enemies of his beloved country; but far above the everla&s;ting hills&mdash;even, we tru&s;t and believe, to the eternal heavens, where JESUS, the Almighty JESUS, &s;miles upon his &s;ervant <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> and fully rewards him for his faithful &s;ervices while an inhabitant of this lower world. But to return:</P>
<P><HI>Samuel</HI> like, he had the happine&s;s to &s;ee the American I&s;rael, ma&s;ters of the field&mdash;under his au&s;pices, a happy and honorable peace&mdash;and our Independence acknowledged by his Bri|tannic maje&s;ty. And, as in the admini&s;tration of <HI>Samuel,</HI> to wit, through his whole life, the Phili&s;tines no more troubled I&s;rael; &s;o, in like manner, through the whole admini&s;tration of
<PB N="9" REF="038551_0009_101257FDB26108A0">
the illu&s;trious <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> no enemy in an ho&s;tile manner, dur&s;t invade our borders.</P>
<P>After the whole work was fini&s;hed, our dear General retired to his &s;eat at <HI>Mount-Vernon,</HI> to enjoy the plea&s;ures of dome&s;tic life: but this re&s;t was &s;hort. Behold the great <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> was born for nobler ends&mdash;to rule GOD's American I&s;rael: and as <HI>Samuel</HI> became the chief magi&s;trate in all I&s;rael, &s;o our beloved <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> by the appointment of Heaven, and the voice of all the People, became the chief magi&s;trate, or governor, of the United States&punc; he was twice unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en to be the chief magi&s;trate of a free people. In this high office, his conduct and prudence was &s;uch as commanded the re&s;pect of all the people, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t. Even all the powers of Europe admired and revered our amiable Leader. Yet, neverthele&s;s, though his charac|ter was &s;o &s;potle&s;s, in every point of view, as a Man&mdash;as a Chri&s;tian&mdash;as a State&s;man&mdash;as a brave Soldier&mdash;as a wi&s;e and valiant General &mdash;as a tender Parent to his people, and a faith|ful and di&s;intere&s;ted friend to his country; yet, as it was with the infatuated I&s;raelites, in rejecting and finding fault with the admini&s;tra|tion
<PB N="10" REF="038551_0010_10125800263BC7E0">
of <HI>Samuel;</HI> &s;o &s;ome of the people in the United States found fault with our decea&s;ed General, and with our happy federal and mo&s;t glorious con&s;titution, in the framing of which the decea&s;ed was a principal agent, and of which I may &s;ay, it is the mo&s;t free and happy con&s;titution in the world; for which we ought ever to adore the di&s;po&s;er of all events. But, brethren, let us reflect, that when we &s;in again&s;t our rulers, we &s;in again&s;t God him&s;elf. See <HI>Samuel</HI> viii.7. thus &s;aith the Lord to <HI>Samuel,</HI>
<Q>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I &s;hould not reign over them.</Q>
But why brethren, &s;hould we wonder, that there are men found among us that &s;light General <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> when it is too great a truth, that there are many among us who &s;light and treat with the greate&s;t di&s;re&s;pect the adorable and ever ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, and the mild government of our gracious and &s;in-par|doning GOD. O! fooli&s;h people and unwi&s;e, thus to treat the Lord of glory. Fooli&s;h indeed mu&s;t that mortal be, who dare attempt to ru&s;h upon the fierce bo&s;&s;es of GOD Almighty's buckler. Can any of us bear everla&s;ting burnings, or dwell with devouring fire? Oh!
<PB N="11" REF="038551_0011_10125801C4504750">
no! no! Then, for your &s;oul's &s;ake lay down the arms of your rebellion, while there is yet a po&s;&s;ibility of obtaining mercy.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, Samuel</HI> died, and all I&s;rael lamen|ted him; and they buried him on his own place &mdash;and &s;ays the <HI>True American,</HI> "O painful reflexion! on Saturday, the 14 In&s;tant <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">December 1799.</NOTE>, died &s;uddenly, at his &s;eat in Virginia, General GEORGE WASHINGTON, Commander in Chief of the Armies of the United States of America&mdash;mature in years&mdash;covered with glory, and rich in the affections of the American people. But our lo&s;s, we have no doubt, is our illu&s;trious Leader's gain:&mdash;and while we, with <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> lament and cry, 'my Father, my Father, the chariots of I&s;rael and the hor&s;e|men thereof,' our dear <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> has di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his fiery chariot, being &s;afely arrived far above the everla&s;ting hills&mdash;where &s;in and &s;orrow never come."</P>
<P>Indeed, my brethren, the exit of this great man, the wonder of the age, may truly be &s;aid to be a fiery trial, as his quivering lips pro|nounced in his la&s;t agonies. As his re&s;piration became difficult, he &s;aid calmly, "I die hard
<PB N="12" REF="038551_0012_1012580438778160">
Doctor"&mdash;but notwith&s;tanding the excruciating agonies of his violent di&s;ea&s;e, he tranquilly a&s;ked &s;everal que&s;tions during the evening. About 15 minutes before he died, he &s;aid, "Doctor what is the Clock? How long am I to continue in this &s;ituation?" The Doctor an|&s;wered, "Not long &s;ir"&mdash;he rejoined, with the firme&s;t countenance imaginable, "I have no fear, Doctor, to die." O! happy <HI>Wa&s;hing|ton!</HI> O! man greatly beloved&mdash;I&s;rael's King has well de&s;cribed thy ca&s;e, P&s;alm xxxvii.37. "Mark the perfect man, and behold the up|right: for the end of that man is peace."</P>
<P>Such was the peaceful departure of the great and good <HI>Wa&s;hington.</HI> As he lived, &s;o he died: tranquil in the field of battle; and beyond all human conception tranquil on a dying bed: we may truly &s;ay the end of &s;uch a man was peace, as Mr. Harvey has beautifully de&s;cribed. "The &s;ufferer, all patient and adoring, &s;ubmits to the divine will; and, by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, becomes &s;uperior to his afflictions. He is &s;en&s;ibly touched with the di&s;con&s;olate &s;tate of his attendants; and pierced with an anxious concern for his wife, the dear partner of his bo&s;om, who will &s;oon become a di&s;con|&s;olate widow. Yet, though ca&s;t down, not in
<PB N="13" REF="038551_0013_10125807D678AB98">
de&s;pair. He is greatly refre&s;hed by his tru&s;t in the everla&s;ting Covenant, and his hope of approaching glory. Religion gives a dignity to di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;The &s;oul ju&s;t going to abandon the tottering clay, collects all her force, and exerts her la&s;t efforts." The good, the great <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> rai&s;es his dying hand&mdash;clo&s;es his own eyes and mouth&mdash;and, with the greate&s;t compo&s;ure, re&s;igns his departing &s;pirit into the hands of its divine Former, the ever adorable IMMANUEL, who is GOD over all, and ble&s;&s;ed forever, Amen.</P>
<P>Thus died the memorable <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> in a very particular cri&s;is. As it was with <HI>Samuel,</HI> as we &s;aid before, at a time when Saul was &s;o outrageous; &s;o it was a peculiar time of danger to the United States, when our General died: a time, when &s;ome of the European powers threatened us with war and deva&s;tation. Never was there a time, when General <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> was more wanted than now&mdash;yet now he is removed&mdash;even &s;o, Father, for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight.</P>
<P>My brethren, when men of common charac|ter are &s;wept from the theatre of life, they die without the tribute of public notice, as they
<PB N="14" REF="038551_0014_1012580A4FB047F8">
had lived without a claim to public e&s;teem. But when, in compliance with Heaven's high mandate, the Hero of the age lies numbered with the dead&mdash;when the reverend &s;age&mdash;the augu&s;t &s;tate&s;man&mdash;the father of his country has re&s;igned his breath: when the beloved of an empire&mdash;the envy and admiration of di&s;tant nations, and the brighte&s;t ornament of human nature, in this late age of the world&mdash; when <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> the &s;ervant of divine IM|MANUEL, is no more&mdash;let a &s;en&s;e of the general lo&s;s be te&s;tified, by the badges of a general mourning;
<Q><L>For as the &s;tars that guild the vault of night,</L>
<L>Unnumber'd, pour effulgence on the &s;ight;</L>
<L>So Chiefs, and Senators in crouds abound:</L>
<L>But rare as comets <HI>Wa&s;hingtons</HI> are found.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> they buried <HI>Samuel</HI> in his own hou&s;e. So the mortal part of this great man was buried on his own place at Mount-Vernon, his once beloved retreat; where now remains the dear body of our beloved Chief, waiting till the la&s;t trump &s;hall &s;ound to the general judg|ment, when the ever adorable and ineffable Redeemer &s;hall come to be glorified in his
<PB N="15" REF="038551_0015_1012580BE93B05F0">
&s;aints, and admired by all that believe. Tis then we may expect to &s;ee the now emaciated body of the dear decea&s;ed reunited to its &s;i&s;ter &s;pirit, his noble and redeemed &s;oul; and both &s;oul and body fitted, by the Creator of all worlds, for the full enjoyment of I&s;rael's God, forever and ever. Until that happy day, let us take comfort in contemplating the happy flight of our General's immortal part through the etherial blue to realms of bli&s;s: as &s;aith the poet&mdash;
<Q><L>"From Vernon's Mount behold the Hero ri&s;e!</L>
<L>Re&s;plendent forms attend him through the &s;kies;</L>
<L>The &s;hades of war worn veteran's round him throng,</L>
<L>And lead enwrapt their honour'd Chief along.</L>
<L>A laurel wreath th' immortal <HI>Warren</HI> bears&mdash;</L>
<L>An arch triumphant <HI>Mercer's</HI> hand prepares&mdash;</L>
<L>Montgomery's god-like form directs the way,</L>
<L>And <HI>Green</HI> unfolds the gates of endle&s;s day.</L>
<L>While angels, trumpet tongued, proclaim thro' air,</L>
<L>Due honours for the fir&s;t of men prepare."</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus ended the life of this great man: and as it is recorded of <HI>Samuel,</HI> that all the I&s;raelites lamented him&mdash;&s;o let it be recorded of General <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> that every true American&mdash;that every &s;on of Liberty&mdash;that every friend to the
<PB N="16" REF="038551_0016_1012580E605079E8">
be&s;t and milde&s;t government in the world la|mented him. And how &s;imilar is the lamentation for the great <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> to the lamentation made for the great <HI>Samuel.</HI> "And all the I&s;raelites gathered together, and lamented him." And is it not &s;o through the United States for the dear decea&s;ed? Do not the rulers and people every where gather together to make lamentation, and &s;how due honours to the decea&s;ed parent of their country? See the illu&s;trious and excellent <HI>Adams,</HI> with the honourable Congre&s;s of the United States, deeply mourning and lamenting America's faithful friend, and &s;howing every mark of re&s;pect and pure affection to his memory. Take a view of his excellency <HI>Richard Howell,</HI> our worthy Governor and Commander in Chief of the Armies of New-Jer&s;ey, with his aids, with mournful &s;teps following the funeral proce&s;s in Philadelphia. See the patriots in every department, wearing the badge of mourning; &s;howing by this outward &s;ign, the inward and &s;incere &s;orrow of their &s;ouls, for &s;o great a lo&s;s as they feel in being deprived of their Commander in Chief. Take a view of the mini&s;ters of JESUS CHRIST, of all
<PB N="17" REF="038551_0017_101258120C76DB60">
denominations, paying due re&s;pect to the memory of their patron, the excellent <HI>Wa&s;hing|ton,</HI> the gift of their covenant GOD, who was as a nur&s;ing father to the church of IMMANUEL while he continued among them. See the churches dedicated to the &s;acred wor&s;hip of Jehovah, all hung in deep mourning, all be&s;peaking unfeigned &s;orrow for the much loved <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> the &s;ervant of the living GOD, of his church, and of his people.</P>
<P>Such honour has our heavenly Father confer|red upon his faithful &s;ervant's la&s;t remains: for &s;urely, brethren, it is the &s;earcher of hearts alone, that is able to melt the hearts of an whole empire. O! Ble&s;&s;ed GOD! thou art divinely good, beyond all we poor mortals can conceive of thee, to them that &s;erve thee in this lower world. Did any of the &s;ons of men ever &s;erve our God, and did not in this pre&s;ent world receive ten thou&s;and fold, and in the world to come, life everla&s;ting? As &s;aith the poet:
<Q><LG>
<L>"Far from the&s;e narrow &s;cenes of night,</L>
<L>Unbounded glories ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And realms of infinite delight,</L>

O! ble&s;&s;ed LORD, wilt thou be with thy &s;ervant <HI>Adams,</HI> as thou wa&s;t with thy &s;ervant <HI>Wa&s;hington:</HI> pre&s;erve his u&s;eful life, O!

<P>AND now my brother officers, and fellow &s;oldiers, an Addre&s;s to you mu&s;t clo&s;e the mournful &s;cene.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I lament with you the lo&s;s, the great lo&s;s of the virtuous <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> our beloved General: but, brethren, the Lord has done it. Let us not murmur at the awful &s;troke; but rather let the removal of our beloved and affectionate Parent, our valiant and illu&s;trious Leader, &s;timulate us to &s;eek the favour and friend&s;hip of our eternal Father, who is ALONE able to &s;ave our country&mdash;our per&s;ons&mdash;our wives&mdash;our children, and our immortal &s;ouls with an everla&s;ting &s;alvation; and to place us where, we tru&s;t, our dear General lives, in immortal glory. Let us &s;trive to imitate the example of that great man, and follow him as he followed CHRIST. Let us u&s;e all our power to promote the intere&s;t of our pre&s;ent mo&s;t excellent government. Let us be found

in due &s;ubordination to our &s;uperior officers, as the mini&s;ters of GOD, and let us always remember that awful &s;entence, "He that re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of GOD." But the rather, brethren, let us give diligence to be found obedient to tho&s;e whom GOD Almighty hath placed in authority over us. And, above all, my brethren, let us u&s;e fervent prayer, through the merits of divine Emanuel, for the revival of decayed religion among us&mdash;that our land may pro&s;per, and our Independence maintain under the au&s;pices of the King eternal, immortal, and only wi&s;e GOD, JESUS CHRIST; to whom be glory, honour and power, forever and ever, Amen.</P>
