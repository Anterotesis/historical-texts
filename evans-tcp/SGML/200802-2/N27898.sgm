<HEAD>Bear ye one another's Burdens.</HEAD>
<P>ONCE upon a time methought I &s;et out upon a long journey, and the place through which I travelled appear|ed to be a dark Valley which was called the valley of Tears. It had obtained this name not only on account of the many &s;orrowful adventures which poor pa&s;&s;engers commonly meet with in their journey through it; but al&s;o becau&s;e mo&s;t of the&s;e Travellers entered it weep|ing and crying, and left it in very great pain and angui&s;h. This va&s;t valley was full of people of all colours, ages, &s;izes,
<PB N="4" REF="037163_0003_100CDEDE1093D5E0">
and de&s;criptions. But whether white or black, or tawney, all were travel|ling the &s;ame road; or rather they were taking different little paths which all led to the &s;ame common end.</P>
<P>Now it was remarkable that notwith|&s;tanding the different complexions, ages, and tempers of this va&s;t variety of peo|ple, yet all re&s;embled each other in this one re&s;pect, that each had a burden on his back which he was de&s;tined to carry through the toil and heat of the day, until he &s;hould arrive by a longer or &s;horter cour&s;e at his journey's end. The&s;e burdens would in general have made the pilgrimage quite intolerable, had not the Lord of the Valley, out of his great compa&s;&s;ion for the&s;e poor Pil|grims, provided among other things, the following means for their relief.</P>
<P>In their full view over the entrance of the Valley, there were written in great letters the following words&punc;</P>
<Q>Bear ye one another's Burdens.</Q>
<P>Now I &s;aw in my vi&s;ion that many
<PB N="5" REF="037163_0004_100CDEE0D270D728">
of the Travellers hurried on without &s;topping to read this in&s;truction, and others, though they had once read it, yet paid little or no attention to it. A third &s;ort thought it very good advice for other people, but very &s;eldom appli|ed it to them&s;elves. In &s;hort I &s;aw that too many of tho&s;e people were of opini|on that they had burdens enough of their own, and that there was therefore no oc|ca&s;ion to take upon them tho&s;e of others; &s;o each tried to make his own load as light, and his own journey as plea&s;ant as he could, without &s;o much as once ca&s;ting a thought on a poor over loaded neighbour. Here however I have to make a rather &s;ingular remark, by which I &s;hall plainly &s;hew the folly of the&s;e &s;elfi&s;h people. It was &s;o ordered and contrived by the Lord of this valley, that if any one &s;tretched out his hand to lighten a neighbour's burden, in fact he never failed to find that he at that moment al&s;o lightened his own. Be|&s;ides, the obligation to help each other, and the benefit of doing &s;o were mutual. If a man helped his neighbour it com|monly happened that &s;ome other neigh|bours
<PB N="6" REF="037163_0005_100CDEE2DF49F2E0">
came by and by and helped him in his turn; for their was no &s;uch thing as what we call <HI>independence</HI> in the whole Valley. Not one of all the&s;e Travellers, however &s;tout and &s;trong, could move on comfortably without a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, for &s;o the Lord of the Valley, who&s;e laws were all of them kind and good, had expre&s;sly ordained.</P>
<P>I &s;tood &s;till to watch the progre&s;s of the&s;e poor way-faring people, who mo|ved &s;lowly on, like &s;o many Ticket por|ters, with burdens of various kinds on their backs; of which &s;ome were heavi|er, and &s;ome were lighter, but from a burden of one kind or other, not one Traveller was entirely free.</P>

<P>A &s;orrowful Widow, oppre&s;&s;ed with the burden of grief for the lo&s;s of an affectionate hu&s;band, would have been bowed down by her heavy load, had not the &s;urviving children with great alacri|ty &s;tepped forward and &s;upported her. Their kindne&s;s after a while, &s;o much.

<P>I next &s;aw a poor old man tottering under a burden then &s;o heavy, that I ex|pected him every moment to &s;ink under it. I peeped into his pack, and &s;aw it was made up of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> articles; there was poverty, oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;ickne&s;s, debt, and what made by far the heavie&s;t part, undutiful children. I was wondering how it was he had got on even &s;o well as he did, till I &s;pied his wife, a kind, meek, Chri&s;tian woman, who was doing her utmo&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. She quietly got behind, gently laid her &s;houlder to the burden, and carried a much larger proportion of it than appeared to me when I was at a di&s;tance. She not on|ly &s;u&s;tained him by her &s;trength, but cheered him by her coun&s;els. She told him that "through much tribulation we mu&s;t enter into re&s;t," that "he that overcometh &s;hall inherit all things." In &s;hort, &s;he &s;o &s;upported his fainting

<HEAD>The kind Neighbour.</HEAD>
<P>An infirm blind woman was creeping forward with a very heavy burden, in which were packed &s;ickne&s;s and want, with numberle&s;s other of tho&s;e raw ma|terials, out of which human mi&s;ery is worked up. She was &s;o weak that &s;he could not have got on at all, had it not been for the kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance of another woman almo&s;t as poor as her&s;elf; who, though &s;he had no light burden of her own, cheerfully lent an helping hand to a fellow traveller who was &s;till more heavily laden. This friend had indeed little or nothing to give, but the very voice of kindne&s;s is &s;oothing to the wea|ry. And I remarked in many other ca|&s;es, that it was not &s;o much the degree of the help afforded, as the manner of helping that lightened the burdens. Some had a coar&s;e, rough clum&s;y way of a&s;&s;i&s;ting a neighbour, which, though in fact it might be of real u&s;e, yet &s;eem|ed,
<PB N="9" REF="037163_0008_100CDEE9A3EBF410">
by galling the Travellers, to add to the load it was intended to lighten; while I ob&s;erved in others that &s;o cheap a kindne&s;s as a mild word, or even an affectionate look made a poor burdened wretch move on cheerily. The bare feeling that &s;ome human being cared for him, &s;eemed to lighten the load. But to return to this kind neighbour. She had a little old book in her hand, the covers of which were worn out by much u&s;e. When &s;he &s;aw the blind woman ready to faint &s;he would read her a few words out of this book, &s;uch as the fol|lowing&mdash;"Ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in &s;pirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." "Ble&s;&s;ed are they that mourn, for they &s;hall be comforted." "I will never leave thee nor for&s;ake thee." "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory."</P>

<HEAD>The Clergyman.</HEAD>
<P>A pious Mini&s;ter, &s;inking under the weight of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed pari&s;h, who&s;e worldly wants he was totally unable to
<PB N="10" REF="037163_0009_100CDEEBED95DC60">
bear, was &s;uddenly relieved by a good widow, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">me up and took all the &s;ick and hungry on her own &s;houlders. The burden of the pari&s;h thus divided became tolerable. The Mini&s;ter, being no longer bowed down by the temporal di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his people, applied him&s;elf chearfully to his own part of the weight. And it was plea&s;ant to &s;ee how tho&s;e two per&s;ons, neither of them very &s;trong, or rich, or healthy, by thus kindly uni|ting together, were enabled to bear the weight of a whole pari&s;h; though &s;ingly, either of them mu&s;t have &s;unk under the attempt. And I remember one great grief I felt during my whole journey was&punc; that I did not &s;ee more of this uni|on and concurring kindne&s;s, by which all the burdens might have been &s;o ea&s;i|ly divided. It troubled me to ob&s;erve, that of all the laws of the Valley there was not one more frequently broken than <HI>the law of kindness.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Negroes.</HEAD>
<P>I now &s;pied a &s;warm of poor black men, women and children, a multitude
<PB N="11" REF="037163_0010_100CDEED915BB1F0">
which no man could number; the&s;e groaned, and toiled, and &s;weated, and bled under far heavier loads than I had &s;een. But for a while no man helped them; at length a few white travellers were touched with the &s;orrowful &s;ighing of tho&s;e millions, and very heartily did they put their hands to the burdens; but their number was not quite equal to the work they had undertaken. I per|ceived, however, that they never lo&s;t &s;ight of tho&s;e poor heavy laden wretch|es and as the number of tho&s;e generous helpers encrea&s;ed, I felt a comfortable hope, that before all the blacks got out of the Valley, the whites would fairly divide the burden, and the loads would be effectually lightened.</P>
<P>Among the travellers, I had occa&s;ion to remark, that tho&s;e who mo&s;t kicked and &s;truggled under their burdens, on|ly made them &s;o much the heavier; for their &s;houlders became extremely galled by tho&s;e vain &s;truggles. The load, if borne patiently, would in the end have turned even to the advantage of the bearers (for &s;o the Lord of the Valley
<PB N="12" REF="037163_0011_100CDEEFDAD57220">
had kindly decreed) but as to the&s;e grumblers they had all the &s;mart and none of the benefit. But the thing which made all the&s;e burdens &s;eem &s;o very heavy was, that in every one with|out exception, there was a certain <HI>inner pacquet,</HI> which mo&s;t of the Travellers took pains to conceal, and carefully wrap up; and while they were forward enough to complain of the other part of their burdens, few &s;aid a word about this; though in truth it was the pre&s;&s;ing weight of this <HI>secret pacquet</HI> which &s;er|ved to render the general burden &s;o in|tolerable. In &s;pite of all their caution, I contrived to get a peep at it, I found in each that this pacquet had the &s;ame label; the word SIN was written on all as a general title, and in ink &s;o black that they could not wa&s;h it out. I ob|&s;erved that mo&s;t of them took no &s;mall pains to hide the writing; but I was &s;urprized to &s;ee that they did not try to get rid of the load but the label. If any kind friend who a&s;&s;i&s;ted the&s;e people in bearing their burdens, did but &s;o much as hint at the <HI>secret pacquet,</HI> or advi&s;e them to get rid of it, they took fire at
<PB N="13" REF="037163_0012_100CDEF192769BB8">
once, and commonly denied they had any &s;uch article in their portmanteau; and it was tho&s;e who&s;e <HI>secret pacquet</HI> &s;welled to the mo&s;t enormous &s;ize, who mo&s;t &s;toutly denied they had any.</P>
<P>I &s;aw with plea&s;ure, however, that &s;ome who had long laboured heartily to get rid of this inward pacquet at length found it much dimini&s;hed, and the more this pacquet &s;hrunk in &s;ize, the lighter was the other part of their burdens al|&s;o.</P>
<P>Then, methought, all at once, I heard a voice as it had been the voice of an angel, crying out and &s;aying, "Ye unhappy Pilgrims, why are ye troubled about the burden which ye are doomed to bear through this Valley of tears? Know ye not that as &s;oon as ye &s;hall have e&s;caped out of this Valley, the whole burden &s;hall drop off, provi|ded ye neglect not to remove that in|ward weight of SIN which principally oppre&s;&s;es you? Study then the whole Will of the Lord of this Valley. Learn from him how this heavy part of your
<PB N="14" REF="037163_0013_100CDEF48C7F8620">
burdens may now be le&s;&s;ened, and how at la&s;t it &s;hall be removed for ever. Be comforted. Faith and Hope may cheer you even in this Valley&punc; The pa&s;&s;age, though it &s;eems long to weary Travel|lers, is comparatively &s;hort; for beyond it there is a Land of everla&s;ting Re&s;t, where ye &s;hall hunger no more, neither thir&s;t any more, where ye &s;hall be led by living fountains of water, and all tears &s;hall be wiped away from your eyes."</P>

<HEAD>THE VALLEY OF TEARS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>NOW I had a &s;econd vi&s;ion of what was pa&s;&s;ing in <HI>the Valley of Tears.</HI> Methought I &s;aw again the &s;ame kind of travellers whom I had &s;een in the former part, and they were wandering at large through the &s;ame va&s;t wilderne&s;s. At fir&s;t &s;etting out on his journey, each Traveller had a &s;mall lamp &s;o fixed in his bo&s;om that it &s;eemed to make a part of him&s;elf, but as this <HI>natural light</HI> did not prove to be &s;ufficient to direct them in the right way, the king of the coun|try, in pity to their wanderings and their blindne&s;s, out of his gracious con|de&s;cen&s;ion promi&s;ed to give the&s;e poor way-faring people an additional &s;upply
<PB N="16" REF="037163_0015_100CDEF88B5E5EB0">
of light from his own Royal Trea&s;ury. But as he did not chu&s;e to lavi&s;h his favours where there &s;eemed no di&s;po&s;iti|on to receive them, he would not be&s;tow any of his oil on &s;uch as did not think it worth a&s;king for. <HI>Ask and ye shall have,</HI> was the rule he laid down for them. Many were prevented from a&s;k|ing through pride, for they thought they had light enough already, preferring the feeble glimmerings of their own lamp to all the light from the king's trea&s;ury. Yet it was ob&s;erved of tho&s;e who rejected it, as thinking they had enough, that hardly any acted up to what even their own light &s;hewed them. Others were deterred from a&s;king, be|cau&s;e they were&punc; told that it not only pointed out the dangers and difficulties of the road, but by a certain reflecting power, it turned inward on them&s;elves, and revealed to them ugly &s;ights in their own hearts, to which they rather cho&s;e to be blind&punc; for tho&s;e Travellers <HI>chose darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</HI> Now it was re|markable that the&s;e two properties were in&s;eparable, and that the lamp would be
<PB N="17" REF="037163_0016_100CDEFAE42BFE98">
of little outward u&s;e, except to tho&s;e who u&s;ed it as an internal reflector. A threat and a promi&s;e al&s;o never failed to accompany the offer of this light from the king, a promi&s;e that to tho&s;e who improved what they had, <HI>more should be given, and a threat that from those who did not use it wisely, should be taken away even what they had.</HI></P>
<P>I ob&s;erved that when the road was ve|ry dangerous, when terrors and difficul|ties and death be&s;et the faithful travel|ler, then on their fervent importunity, the king voluntarily gave large and bountiful &s;upplies of light, &s;uch as in common &s;ea&s;ons never could have been expected; always proportioning the quantity given to the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, <HI>as their day was, such was their light and strength.</HI></P>
<P>Though many cho&s;e to depend entire|ly on their own lamp, yet it was ob&s;er|ved that this light was apt to go out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> left to it&s;elf. It was ea&s;ily blown out by tho&s;e violent gu&s;ts which were perpetu|ally howling through the wilderne&s;s, and
<PB N="18" REF="037163_0017_100CDEFCE4683890">
indeed it was the natural tendency of that unwhole&s;ome atmo&s;phere to extin|gui&s;h it, ju&s;t as you have &s;een a candle go out when expo&s;ed to the vapours and foul air of a damp room. It was a me|lancholy &s;ight to &s;ee multitudes of Tra|vellers heedle&s;sly pacing on, boa&s;ting they had light enough, and de&s;pi&s;ing the offer of more. But what a&s;toni&s;hed me mo&s;t of all was, to &s;ee many, and &s;ome of them too accounted men of fir&s;t rate wit, actually bu&s;y in blowing out their own light, becau&s;e while any &s;park of it remained, it only &s;erved to torment them, and point out things which they did not wi&s;h to &s;ee. And having once blown out their own light, they were not ea&s;y till they had blown out that of their neighbour's al&s;o; &s;o that a good part of the wilderne&s;s &s;eemed to exhi|bit a &s;ort of univer&s;al <HI>blindman's buff&punc;</HI> each endeavouring to catch his neigh|bour, while his own voluntary blindne&s;s expo&s;ed him to be caught him&s;elf, &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat each was actually falling into the &s;nare he was laying for another, till at length, as &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is the natural con|&s;equence of blindne&s;s, "catch he that
<PB N="19" REF="037163_0018_100CDEFE78344670">
catch can," became the general cry, throughout the wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now I &s;aw in my vi&s;ion, that there were &s;ome others who were bu&s;y in &s;trewing the mo&s;t gaudy flowers over the numerous bogs, precipices, and pit|falls, with which the wilderne&s;s abound|ed, and thus making danger and death look &s;o gay, that poor thoughtle&s;s crea|tures &s;eemed to delight in their own de|&s;truction. Tho&s;e pit-falls did not ap|pear deep or dangerous, becau&s;e over them were rai&s;ed gay edifices with allu|ring names, in which were &s;inging men and &s;inging women, and dancing, and fea&s;ting, and gaming, and drinking, and jollity, and madne&s;s. But though the &s;cenery was gay, the footing was un&s;ound. The floors were full of holes, through which the unthinking merry-makers were continually &s;inking. Some tumbled through in the middle of a &s;ong, many at the end of a fea&s;t, and though there was many a cup of intoxication wreathed with flowers, yet there was al|ways poi&s;on at the bottom. But what mo&s;t &s;urprized me was, that though no
<PB N="20" REF="037163_0019_100CDF00A2769DD8">
day pa&s;t over their heads in which &s;ome of tho&s;e merry-makers did not drop through, yet their lo&s;s made little im|pre&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e who were left. Nay, in&s;tead of being awakened to more cir|cum&s;pection and &s;elf denial by the con|tinual dropping off of tho&s;e about them, &s;everal of them &s;eemed to borrow from thence an argument of a direct contra|ry tendency, and the very &s;hortne&s;s of the time was only urged as a rea&s;on to u&s;e it more &s;edulou&s;ly for the indulgence in &s;en&s;ual delights. <HI>Let us eat and drink for to-morrow we die. Let us crown our|selves with rose-buds before they are withered.</HI> With the&s;e and a thou&s;and other &s;uch little mottos, the gay gar|lands of the wilderne&s;s were decorated. Some admired poets were &s;et to work to put the mo&s;t corrupt &s;entiments into the mo&s;t harmonious tunes&punc; the&s;e were &s;ung without &s;cruple, chiefly indeed by the loo&s;er &s;ons of riot, but not &s;eldom al&s;o by the more orderly daughters of &s;obriety, who were not a&s;hamed to &s;ing to the &s;ound of in&s;truments, &s;entiments &s;o corrupt and immoral, that they would have blu&s;hed to &s;peak or read them;
<PB N="21" REF="037163_0020_100CDF039F5E5D70">
but the mu&s;ic &s;eemed to &s;anctify the cor|ruption, e&s;pecially &s;uch as was con|nected with love or drinking.</P>
<P>Now I ob&s;erved that all the travellers who had &s;o much as a &s;park of light left, &s;eemed every now and then, as they moved onwards, to ca&s;t an eye, though with very different degrees of attention, towards the <HI>happy land,</HI> which they were told lay at the end of their journey: but as they could not &s;ee very far forward, and as they knew there was a <HI>dark and shadowy valley</HI> which mu&s;t needs be cro&s;&s;ed before they could at|tain to the <HI>happy land,</HI> they tried to turn their attention from it as much as they could. The truth is, they were not &s;ufficiently apt to con&s;ult a map which the king had given them, and which pointed out the <HI>road</HI> to the happy land &s;o clearly, that <HI>the way-faring man though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could not err.</HI> This map al&s;o defined very correctly the bounda|ries of the <HI>happy land</HI> from the <HI>land of misery,</HI> both of which lay on the other &s;ide of the <HI>dark and shadowy valley;</HI> but &s;o many beacons and light-hou&s;es were
<PB N="22" REF="037163_0021_100CDF0538E27830">
erected, &s;o many clear and explicit di|rections furni&s;hed for avoiding the one country and attaining the other, that it was not the king's fault, if even one &s;ingle Traveller got wrong. But I am inclined to think that in &s;pite of the map, and the king's word, and his of|fers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance to get them thither, that the Travellers in general did not heartily and truly believe after all, that there was any &s;uch country as the <HI>hap|py land;</HI> or at lea&s;t the paltry and tran|&s;ient plea&s;ures of the wilderne&s;s &s;o be|&s;otted them, the thoughts of the <HI>dark and shadowy valley</HI> &s;o frightened them, that they thought they &s;hould be more comfortable by bani&s;hing all thought and foreca&s;t.</P>
<P>Now I al&s;o &s;aw in my dream, that there were two roads through the wil|derne&s;s, one of which every Traveller mu&s;t needs take. The fir&s;t was narrow, and difficult and rough, but it was in|fallibly &s;afe. It did not admit the Tra|veller to &s;tray either to the right hand or the left, yet it was far from being de|&s;titute of real comforts or &s;ober plea|&s;ures.

The other was a <HI>broad and tempting way,</HI> abounding with luxurious fruits and gaudy flowers to tempt the eye, and plea&s;e the appetite. To for|get this dark valley, through which eve|ry Traveller was well a&s;&s;ured he mu&s;t one day pa&s;s, &s;eemed indeed the object of general de&s;ire. To this grand end, all that human ingenuity could invent was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;et to work. The Travellers read, and they wrote, and they painted, and they &s;ung, and they danced, and they drank as they went along, not &s;o much becau&s;e they all ca|red for the&s;e things, or had any real joy in them, as becau&s;e this re&s;tle&s;s activity &s;erved to divert their attention from e|ver being fixed on the <HI>dark and shadowy valley.</HI></P>
<P>The king, who knew the thoughtle&s;s temper of the Travellers, and how apt they were to forget their journey's end, had thought of a thou&s;and little kind attentions to warn them of their dangers.

Many went wrong becau&s;e they prefered a merry journey to a &s;afe one and were terrified by certain notices chiefly intended for the <HI>narrow-way</HI> Travellers, &s;uch as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice;</HI> but had the&s;e fooli&s;h peo|ple allowed them&s;elves time or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tience to read to the end which they &s;eldom would do, they would have &s;een the&s;e comfortable words added, <HI>but your sor|row

<P>Now I al&s;o &s;aw in my dream, that ma|ny travellers who had a &s;trong dread of ending at the <HI>Land of misery,</HI> walked up to the <HI>Strait Gate,</HI> hoping that though the entrance was narrow, yet if they could once get in, the road would widen; but what was their grief, when on look|ing more clo&s;ely they &s;aw written on the in&s;ide <HI>narrow is the way;</HI> this made them take fright, they compared the in|&s;cription with which the whole way was lined, &s;uch as, <HI>be ye not conformed to this world&mdash;deny yourselves, take up your cross,</HI> with all the tempting plea|&s;ures of the wilderne&s;s. Some indeed recollected the fine de&s;criptions they had read of the <HI>Happy Lana, the Gol|den City, and the Rivers of Pleasures,</HI> and they &s;ighed: but then, tho&s;e joys were di&s;tant, and from the faintne&s;s of their light they &s;oon got to think that what was remote might be uncertain, and while the pre&s;ent good increa&s;ed in bulk by it's nearne&s;s, the di&s;tant good

receded, dimini&s;hed, di&s;appeared! Their faith &s;ailed, they would tru&s;t no farther than they could &s;ee; they drew back and got into the <HI>Broad Way,</HI> ta|king a common but &s;ad refuge in the number and gaiety of their companions. When the&s;e &s;aint-hearted people, who yet had &s;et out well, turned back, their light was quite put out, and then they became wor&s;e than tho&s;e who had made no attempt to get in. "For it is impo&s;|&s;ible, that is, it is next to impo&s;&s;ible, for tho&s;e who were once enlightened, and have ta&s;ted of the heavenly gift, and the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they fall away, to renew them again to re|pentance."</P>
<P>A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew hone&s;t humble Travellers not naturally &s;tronger than the re&s;t, but &s;trengthened by their tru&s;t in the king's word, came up by the light of their lamps, and meekly entered in at the <HI>Strait Gate;</HI> as they advanced farther they felt le&s;s heavy, and though the way did not in reality grow wider, yet they grew reconciled to the narrowne&s;s of it,
<PB N="27" REF="037163_0026_100CDF109CAF79B0">
e&s;pecially when they &s;aw the walls here and there &s;tudded with certain jewels called <HI>promises,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>he that endureth to the end shall be saved.</HI> And <HI>my grace is sufficient for you.</HI> Some when they were almo&s;t ready to faint, were encou|raged by &s;eeing that many niches in the <HI>Narrow Way</HI> were filled with &s;tatues and pictures of Saints and Martyrs, who had borne their te&s;timony at the &s;take, that the <HI>Narrow Way</HI> was the &s;afe way; and the&s;e Travellers, in&s;tead of &s;inking at the &s;ight of the painted wheel and gibbet, the &s;word and the fur|nace, were animated by the&s;e words written under them, <HI>those that wear white robes came out of great tribulation,</HI> and <HI>be ye followers of those who, through faith and patience, inherit the promises.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time there came a great multitude of Travellers&punc; all from <HI>Laodi|cea;</HI> this was the large&s;t party I had yet &s;een: the&s;e were <HI>neither hot nor cold,</HI> they would not give up future hope, they could not endure pre&s;ent pain; &s;o they contrived to deceive them&s;elves by fancying that they re&s;olved to keep

the <HI>happy land</HI> in view, yet that there mu&s;t needs be many different ways which led to it, no doubt all equally &s;ure, without being all equally rough; &s;o they &s;et on foot little contrivances to attain the end without u&s;ing the means, and &s;oftened down the &s;pirit of the king's directions to fit them to their own prac|tice. Sometimes they would &s;plit a di|rection in two, and only u&s;e that half which &s;uited them. For in&s;tance, when they met with the following rule, <HI>Trust in the Lord, and be doing good,</HI> they would take the fir&s;t half, and make them|&s;elves ea&s;y with a general &s;ort of tru&s;t, that through the mercy of the king all would go well with them, though, they them&s;elves did nothing; and on the o|ther hand, many made &s;ure that a few good works of their own would do their bu&s;ine&s;s, and carry them &s;afely to the <HI>happy land,</HI> though they did <HI>not</HI> tru&s;t in the Lord, nor place any faith in his word. Thus &s;ome peri&s;hed by a lazy faith, and others by a working pride. A large party of <HI>Pharisees</HI> now appear|ed, who had &s;o neglected their lamp, that they did not &s;ee their way at all,
<PB N="29" REF="037163_0028_100CDF15C1B65EA8">
though they fancied them&s;elves to be full of light; they kept up appearances &s;o well, as to delude others, and mo&s;t effectually to delude them&s;elves with a notion that they might be found in the right way at la&s;t. In this dreadful de|lu&s;ion they went on to the end, and till they were finally plunged in the dark valley, never di&s;covered the horrors which awaited them on the di&s;mal &s;hore. It was remarkable that while the&s;e Pha|ri&s;ees were often boa&s;ting how bright their light burnt, in order to get the prai&s;e of men, the humble travellers, who&s;e &s;teady light &s;hewed their good works to others, refu&s;ed all commenda|tion, and the brighter their light &s;hined before men, &s;o much the more they in|&s;i&s;ted that they ought to glorify not them|&s;elves, but <HI>their father which is in hea|ven.</HI></P>
<P>I now &s;et my&s;elf to ob&s;erve what was the particular lett, mole&s;tation, and hin|drance, which ob&s;tructed particular&punc; Tra|vellers in their endeavours to enter in at the Strait Gate. I remarked a huge portly man who &s;eemed de&s;irous of get|ting
<PB N="30" REF="037163_0029_100CDF18361AEFD8">
in, but he carried about him &s;uch a va&s;t provi&s;ion of bags full of gold, and had on &s;o many rich garments which &s;tuffed him out &s;o wide, that though he pu&s;hed and &s;queezed, like one who had really a mind to get in, yet he could not po&s;&s;ibly do &s;o. Then I heard a voice crying, <HI>woe to him that loadeth him&s;elf with thick clay.</HI> The poor man felt &s;omething was wrong, and even went &s;o far as to change &s;ome of his more cumber&s;ome vanities into others which &s;eemed le&s;s bulky, but &s;till he and his pack were much too wide for the gate. He would not however give up the mat|ter &s;o ea&s;ily, but began to throw away a little of the coar&s;er part of his baggage, but &s;till I remarked that he threw away none of the vanities which lay near his heart. He tried again&punc; but it would not do; &s;till his dimen&s;ions were too large. He now looked up and read the&s;e words, "how hardly &s;hall tho&s;e who have riches enter into the king|dom of God." The poor man &s;ighe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to find that it was impo&s;&s;ible to enjo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> his fill of both worlds, <HI>and went away sorrowing.</HI> If he ever afterwards ca&s;t

a thought towards the <HI>happy land,</HI> it was only to regret that the road which led to it was too narrow to admit any but the meagre children of want, who were not &s;o encumbered by wealth as to be too big for the pa&s;&s;age. Had he read on he would have &s;een that <HI>with God all things are possible.</HI></P>
<P>Another advanced with much confi|dence of &s;ucce&s;s, for having little world|ly riches or honours, the gate did not &s;eem &s;o &s;trait to him. He got to the thre&s;hhold triumphantly, and &s;eemed to look back with di&s;dain on all that he was quitting. He &s;oon found, however, that he was &s;o bloated with pride, and &s;tuffed out with &s;elf &s;ufficiency, that he could not get in. Nay, he was in a wor&s;e way than the rich man ju&s;t named; for <HI>he</HI> was willing to throw away &s;ome of his outward luggage, whereas this man refu&s;ed to part with a grain of that vanity and &s;elf-applau&s;e which made him too big for the way. The &s;en&s;e of his own worth &s;o &s;welled him out, that he &s;tuck fa&s;t in the <HI>gateway,</HI> and could neither get in nor out. Finding now
<PB N="32" REF="037163_0031_100CDF1BEC515A28">
that he mu&s;t cut off all tho&s;e big thoughts of him&s;elf if he wi&s;hed to be reduced to &s;uch a &s;ize as to pa&s;s the gate, he gave up all thoughts of it. He &s;corn|ed that humility and &s;elf-denial which might have &s;hrunk him down to the pro|per dimen&s;ions; the more he in&s;i&s;ted on his own qualifications for entrance, the more impo&s;&s;ible it came, for the bigger he grew. Finding that he mu&s;t become quite another manner of man before he could hope to get in, he gave up the de&s;ire; and I now &s;aw that though when he &s;et his face towards the <HI>happy land</HI> he could not get an inch forward&punc; yet the in&s;tant he made a motion to turn back into the world, his &s;peed became rapid enough, and he &s;oon got back in|to the <HI>broad way.</HI></P>
<P>Many, who for a time were brought down from their u&s;ual bulk by &s;ome af|fliction, &s;eemed to get in with ea&s;e. They now thought all their difficulties over, for having been &s;urfeited with the world, during <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">heir late di&s;appointment, they turned their backs upon it wil|lingly enough. A fit of &s;ickne&s;s per|haps,
<PB N="33" REF="037163_0032_100CDF1EAD0F2FD0">
which is very apt to reduce, had for a time brought their bodies into &s;ub|jection, &s;o that they were able ju&s;t to get in at the <HI>gateway;</HI> but as &s;oon as health and &s;pirits returned, the way grew narrower and narrower to them; they could not get on but turned &s;hort, and got back into the world. I &s;aw ma|ny attempt to enter who were &s;topt &s;hort by a large burden of worldly cares; others by a load of idolatrous attach|ments; but I ob&s;erved that nothing pro|ved a more complete bar than that va&s;t bundle of prejudices with which multi|tudes were loaded. Others were fa|tally ob&s;tructed by loads of bad habits which they would not lay down, though they knew it prevented their entrance. Some few, however, of mo&s;t de&s;criptions, who had kept their light alive by craving con&s;tant &s;upplies from the king's trea|&s;ury, got through at la&s;t by a &s;trength which they felt not to be their own. One poor man, who carried the large&s;t bundle of bad habits I had &s;een, could not get on a &s;tep; he never cea&s;ed how|ever, to implore for light enough to &s;ee where his mi&s;ery lay, he threw down
<PB N="34" REF="037163_0033_100CDF20F765F608">
one of his bundles, then another, but all to little purpo&s;e, &s;till he could not &s;tir. At la&s;t <HI>striving as if in agony</HI> (which is the true way of entering) he threw down the heavie&s;t article in his pack; this was <HI>selfishness,</HI> the poor fel|low felt relieved at once, his light burnt brightly and the re&s;t of his pack was as nothing.</P>
<P>Then I heard a great noi&s;e as of car|penters at work. I looked what this might be, and &s;aw many &s;turdy travel|lers, who finding they were too bulky to get through, took it into their heads not to reduce them&s;elves, but to widen the gate; they hacked on this &s;ide and hewed on that; but all their hacking, and hewing, and hammering, was to no purpo&s;e, they got only their labour for their pains; it was po&s;&s;ible they might have reduced them&s;elves, but they could not widen the way.</P>
<P>What grieved me mo&s;t was to ob&s;erve that many who had got on &s;ucce&s;sfully a good way, now &s;topped to re&s;t, and to admire their own progre&s;s. While they
<PB N="35" REF="037163_0034_100CDF2293B53638">
were thus valuing them&s;elves on their attainments, their light dimini&s;hed. While the&s;e were boa&s;ting how far they had left others behind, who had &s;et out much earlier, &s;ome &s;lower Travellers, who&s;e beginning had not been &s;o pro|mi&s;ing, but who had walked carefully, now out &s;tripped them. The&s;e la&s;t walk|ed, "not as though they had already attained, but this one thing they did, forgetting the things which were behind they pu&s;hed forward toward the mark for the prize of their high calling." The&s;e, though naturally weak; yet, <HI>by laying aside every weight,</HI> fini&s;hed the race that was &s;et before them. Tho&s;e who had kept their <HI>light burning,</HI> who <HI>were not wise in their own conceit,</HI> who <HI>laid their help on one that is mighty,</HI> who had <HI>chosen to suffer affliction rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin,</HI> came at length to the <HI>happy land.</HI> They had in|deed the <HI>dark and shadowy valley</HI> to cro&s;s; but even there they found a <HI>rod and a staff</HI> to comfort them. Their light, in&s;tead of being put out by the damps of the valley of the &s;hadow of death, often burnt with added bright|ne&s;s.
<PB N="36" REF="037163_0035_100CDF25701F4278">
Some indeed &s;uffered the terrors of a &s;hort eclip&s;e; but even then their light, like that of a dark lanthorn, was not put out; it was only hid for a while, and even the&s;e often fini&s;hed their cour&s;e with joy. But be that as it might, the in&s;tant they reached the <HI>Happy Land</HI>&punc; all tears were wiped from their eyes, and the King him&s;elf came forth and welcomed them into his pre|&s;ence, and put a crown upon their heads, with the&s;e words, <HI>Well done good and faithful servant, enter thou in|to the joy of thy LORD.</HI></P>
