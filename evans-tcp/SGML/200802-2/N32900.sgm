</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LET us con&s;ider that we are in the Pre&s;ence of an Holy GOD, who made us, and gives us every good thing we enjoy; who will bring every Work into Judg|ment with every &s;ecret Thing.&mdash;It becomes us therefore with the utmo&s;t awe and reverence, to behave our&s;elves &s;o as not to Break his holy Law, or merit his Divine di&s;|plea&s;ure: You may remember, that within the&s;e few years pa&s;t there has been &s;everal Judgments threatened again&s;t this Land and Nation. The fir&s;t that I &s;hall mention, was in what is commonly called the <HI>Chebucto</HI> fleet, a large fleet &s;ent from <HI>France</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Colonies</HI>; big enough ac|cording to humane under&s;tanding, to have De&s;troyed our &s;hiping, and at lea&s;t to have laid our Sea-Ports in the ut|mo&s;t Ruin and De&s;olation. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fleet at that time by contrary winds, a meer act of providence, hindered from coming to our Relief. But mark, the French fleet taken with a Dreadful Di&s;temper on their pa&s;&s;age; they put into <HI>Chebucto,</HI> where they Died by Thou&s;ands, and were not &s;uffered to do the <HI>Colonies</HI> the lea&s;t Damage.</P>
<P>A ca&s;e &s;omething &s;imilar to what we have told us, Judg. 7.2. <HI>And the Lord &s;aid unto Gideon, the People that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their Hands; le&s;t I&s;rael vaunt them&s;elves again&s;t me, &s;aying, mine own Hand hath &s;aved me.</HI></P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of Judgment threatened again&s;t us, was in the begining of the la&s;t War; Gen. Braddick was defeated by the French and Indians, who came in like a Flood on &s;ome of the Southern Colonies, burning Hou&s;|es, killing and taking Captive many of our People; it
<PB N="3" REF="043211_0003_101CD697A87479D0">
&s;eemed as though they would devour the whole land: But mark&mdash;in the conclu&s;ion of the war, the French, quite from St. Lawrence river to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, were brought into &s;ubjection. Which brings to my mind the prophecy of Amos, who, after he had reproved I&s;rael for divers &s;ins, &s;ays, chap. 7.1. <HI>Thus hath the Lord &s;hewed unto me, and behold he formed gra&s;shoppers in the beginning of the &s;hooting up of the latter growth, and lo, it was the lat|ter growth, after the king's mowings. And it came to pa&s;s, that when they had made an end of eating the gra&s;s of the land, then I &s;aid, O Lord God, forgive, I be&s;eech thee; by whom &s;hall Jacob ari&s;e? for he is &s;mall. The Lord repented for this: It &s;hall not be, &s;aith the Lord. Thus hath the Lord God &s;hewed unto me, and behold, the Lord God called to con|tend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part. Then &s;aid I, O Lord God, cea&s;e, I be&s;eech thee; by whom &s;hall Jacob ari&s;e? for he is &s;mall. The Lord repented for this: This al&s;o &s;hall not be, &s;aith the Lord God.&mdash;Then &s;aid the Lord, Behold, I will &s;et a plum-line in the mid&s;t of my people I&s;rael.</HI>&mdash;Have we not rea&s;on to believe, from the&s;e &s;igns, that there is &s;omething among us that is very offen&s;ive in the eyes of an holy God, that mu&s;t be reform|ed, ere we can expect to pro&s;per. O that there were now a number of praying Amo&s;es, who would &s;ay, O that the Lord would &s;pare his people! it may be that they will repent.&mdash;Are we now engaged in a more dreadful war, blood a running, killing one another? as in <HI>Rev.</HI> 6.4.</P>
<P>I do not determine wherefore it is that the hand of the Lord is gone out again&s;t us: I &s;hall here only ob&s;erve, that God &s;ometimes brings his judgments by in&s;truments, to whom his people have done no wrong; &s;ee <HI>Judges</HI> 10.6, and onward, <HI>And the children of I&s;rael did evil again in the &s;ight of the Lord, and &s;erved Baalim and A&s;htaroth.&mdash; And the anger of the Lord was hot again&s;t I&s;rael, and he &s;old them into the hands of the Phili&s;tines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.</HI> And what harm had the children
<PB N="4" REF="043211_0004_101CD69A0722C458">
of Judah done to the Babylonians? yet how they de&s;troy|ed and captivated them!&mdash;But what was the matter? &s;ee <HI>Jer.</HI> 7.5,&mdash;7. <HI>If ye thoroughly amend your ways, and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour; if ye oppre&s;s not the &s;tranger, the father|le&s;s, and the widow, and &s;hed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods, to your hurt: then will I cau&s;e you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fa|thers, for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>But it is po&s;&s;ible &s;ome of you may &s;ay, at lea&s;t in your hearts, 'We are wi&s;e men, and under&s;tand our intere&s;t exceeding well; who can teach us?'&mdash;But I de&s;ire you to remember, that even the wi&s;e&s;t of men have &s;ometimes need of being put in mind of things they well knew. I will therefore con&s;ider the words in the following order,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Endeavour to &s;how from the &s;cripture, what is true wi&s;dom for men in a fallen condition:</P>
<P>And in the next place, endeavour to &s;how what is true wi&s;dom for a people in a civil &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That who&s;oever &s;hall &s;corn the word of God, that they alone &s;hall bear it.</P>
<P>And <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Shew, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, what it is they &s;hall bear.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> What is wi&s;dom for men in a fallen &s;tate? But let us fir&s;t ob&s;erve, that there is what hath been called wi&s;dom, &s;ee <HI>Daniel,</HI> 5.15. <HI>And now the wi&s;e men, the A|&s;trologers</HI>; who were probably &s;uch men, as by the help of the devil, pretended to foretel future events&punc; but this is &s;o far from the true wi&s;dom intended in the text, that it is the mo&s;t dreadful folly&punc;</P>
<P>Another &s;ort of wi&s;dom is mentioned in 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.13. <HI>Which things al&s;o we &s;peak, not in the words which mans wi&s;dom teacheth, but which the holy Gho&s;t teacheth</HI>: There is &s;uch a thing then as what is called man's wi&s;dom; of this &s;ort of wi&s;dom, I &s;uppo&s;e the apo&s;tle Paul had a large &s;hare before his conver&s;ion, being brought up to

learning, who had the witne&s;s of miracles, and zealous in what he called religion; yet per&s;ecuted the chri&s;tians un|till he received a light from heaven.</P>
<P>We have an account, <HI>John</HI> 3. of <HI>Nichodemus</HI> likewi&s;e a ruler of the Jews, who probably had a great &s;hare of hu|man under&s;tanding or man's wi&s;dom, although he was &s;o far convinced by the miracles, that he &s;aid to our Savi|our, <HI>Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God, for no man can do the&s;e miracles that thou do&s;t, except God be with him</HI>: Yet when our Saviour told him, <HI>Except a man be born again, he connot &s;ee the kingdom of God,</HI> he un|der&s;tands nothing of this by his human wi&s;dom, but &s;ays, <HI>How can a man be born when he is old?</HI> And further &s;aith, <HI>How can the&s;e things be?</HI>&mdash;How ignorant was he of the new-birth, or the new heart which delighteth in hallelujahs and adoration to God! And we are told in plain words, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.14. <HI>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him; neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</HI> And our Saviour him&s;elf &s;ays, <HI>John</HI> 6.45. <HI>It is written in the Prophets, And they &s;hall be all taught of God&mdash;Every man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</HI></P>
<P>My an&s;wer then to the fir&s;t que&s;tion (which is, What is wi&s;dom for men in a fallen e&s;tate) &s;hall be, That it is their wi&s;dom to go to God by &s;olemn prayer, for his mercy in teaching them, and to bring them into true religion by his mighty power, and that with an hone&s;t intention to be conformed to the will of God; for God is a &s;pirit, and they that wor&s;hip him, mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth, <HI>John</HI> 4.24. For if the heart doth not believe that God is righteous to reject its reque&s;t, the prayer is like a demand: and it is therefore the wi&s;dom of &s;inners to beg of God to &s;how them how vile they are, and know that God is &s;overeign of his gifts, or they would cea&s;e to be free grace. And I hope there are none
<PB N="6" REF="043211_0006_101CD69FDE520620">
of you &s;o wi&s;e in your own eyes, as to think you have no need that God &s;hould teach you. Have you more wit than Nichodemus, or St. Paul, who were both taught of God?&mdash;And indeed, could men go to heaven by their own wit and invention, to whom would they &s;ing prai&s;e? Would it be to them&s;elves, while they neglect or de&s;pi&s;e to glorify God? What, &s;elf-&s;aved, and &s;elf-glorified! No; if any are &s;aved, it mu&s;t be by the gift of God.</P>
<P>Which brings me in the &s;econd place, to &s;ay, that who|&s;oever &s;hall &s;corn to beg of God, to renew his heart, and to be taught, he alone &s;hall bear it; for it is written, 'As I live, &s;aith the Lord, every knee &s;hall bow to me, and every tongue &s;hall confe&s;s to God: So then every one of us &s;hall give an account of him&s;elf to God,' <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.11, 12. 'Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for what|&s;oever a man &s;oweth, that &s;hall he al&s;o reap; for he that &s;oweth to his fle&s;h, &s;hall of the fle&s;h reap corruption; but he that &s;oweth to the &s;pirit, &s;hall of the &s;pirit reap life everla&s;ting,' <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.7, 8. And the text is a full confirmation of this. 'If thou &s;corne&s;t, thou alone &s;halt bear it.' But what &s;halt he bear; the an&s;wer is, 'The Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;t|ing de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power,' 2. <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 1.7, 8, 9. 'Then &s;hall he &s;ay al&s;o unto them on the left hand, depart from me ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,' <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.41. The &s;on of man &s;hall &s;end forth his angels, and they &s;hall geather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniqui|ty, and &s;hall ca&s;t them into a furnace of fire, there &s;hall be wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth,' <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.41, 42. 'And I &s;ay unto you my friends, be not affraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they
<PB N="7" REF="043211_0007_101CD6A1E09B9090">
can do. But I will fore-warn you, whom you &s;hall fear&punc; fear him which after he hath killed the body, hath pow|er to ca&s;t into hell: Yea, I &s;ay unto you, fear him,' <HI>Luke,</HI> 12.4. Can any per&s;on get any thing by &s;corning or &s;lighting the coun&s;els of their maker; to be ca&s;t into e|verla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his engels, where the &s;oul dies not, and the fire is not quenched. I conclude this point, with this word, fly from the wrath to come.</P>
<P>In the next place, or <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how what is wi&s;dom for men in a civil &s;tate:&mdash;To this I an&s;wer, It is wi&s;dom for a people to do righteou&s;ly, or what is the &s;ame, to keep the ten commands, for we have the words of the mo&s;t high and holy God, the former of all things, &s;ee <HI>Deut.</HI> 16.20. 'That which is altogether ju&s;t &s;halt thou follow, that thou maye&s;t live and inherit the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.' <HI>Levit.</HI> 18.5. 'Ye &s;hall therefore keep my &s;tatutes, and my judgments, which if a man do, he &s;hall live in them: I am the LORD.'</P>
<P>For in&s;tance; Suppo&s;e a people &s;hould have no law to puni&s;h the breaking any one of the fir&s;t four of the&s;e com|mands, and of con&s;equence have no regard to God; how dreadful mu&s;t be their doom: &s;ee what was &s;aid to the children of I&s;rael; Go and cry unto the gods which ye have cho&s;en, let them deliver you in the time of your tri|bulation, <HI>Judges,</HI> 10.14.</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider the fifth command, which is, Honor thy father and mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. Now if there were no obedience or re&s;pect paid to parents, or ru|lers, how would every villain invade the property of o|thers, &s;pending their time in it &s;o that there could be no &s;u&s;tenance for the people; and if there were no law a|gain&s;t murder, how would people be in danger of lo&s;ing their lives, it would doubtle&s;s take &s;o much time in pre|&s;erving
<PB N="8" REF="043211_0008_101CD6A3DC80E3E8">
them, as that they would not be able to rai&s;e any &s;upport for life.</P>
<P>And &s;ee what is &s;aid again&s;t breaking the &s;eventh com|mand. <HI>Job,</HI> 31.11. 'For this is an heinous crime, yea, it is an iniquity to be puni&s;hed by the judges, for it is a fire that con&s;umeth to de&s;truction, and would root out all mine increa&s;e. And with re&s;pect to the eighth command, were there no law to puni&s;h &s;tealing, how would many think it ea&s;ier to &s;teal for a living, than to labor, which of natural con&s;equence, will ruin any people, and witne&s;s is the eyes of the law; how could the breaking of any one of the&s;e commands be puni&s;hed, if there were nothing but fal&s;e witne&s;s; and the tenth command, which includes the whole, or all hone&s;ty to our neighbour, to be neglected will be equally ruinous.</P>
<P>But you will doubtle&s;s a&s;k in a more particular man|ner, when a nation, or a people, may be truly &s;aid to break any one of the&s;e commands? To this I an&s;wer, That a people, or nation, may be guilty of one villain's &s;tealing a hor&s;e, for when the judges willingly and knowingly, clear the thief, when they know he is guilty, they are partak|ers with the thief; and indeed, for want of a proper en|quiry into truth, they may become guilty: So when a people &s;hall &s;ee that their judges do unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and willingly clear the thief; if they do not endeavor to know and di&s;place &s;uch judges, they all become guilty; for the people are commanded to &s;ee that righteou&s;ne&s;s takes place: &s;ee <HI>Deut.</HI> 16.18. <HI>Judges and officers &s;halt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes; and they &s;hall judge the people with ju&s;t judgment.</HI></P>
<P>This command was given to the people, they ought therefore to have put in officers by election, and to be &s;ure to be left out when they did not do righteou&s;ly. What greater encouragement to wickedne&s;s, than to have no judges; and what greater encouragement to the wick|ed,
<PB N="9" REF="043211_0009_101CD6A607C88208">
than hinder their being found out and puni&s;hed; how &s;everely were the children of I&s;rael puni&s;hed when they made no judges, but left every man to do as he plea&s;ed, or that which was right in his own eyes; &s;ee the end of judges: &s;hould they not have made righteous judges a terror to evil doers, how guilty then of the blood of the Levites wife, and how dangerous was it to put in officers for life, if the people were ju&s;tly charged for what they knew, and &s;uffered their repre&s;entavives to do.</P>
<P>Again, kings or rulers may be greatly to blame ano|ther way. For in&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;e a king, or rulers, &s;hould take from the people ninety-nine parts of an hundren of the produce from the people, or the value, and lay it up for them&s;elves, or give it to pentioners, or charity men, and enable them to carry on rioting, and drunkenne&s;s, while the people are greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to maintain it; it may be as great a burden, as to be &s;laves: and how wick|ed is it to rate the people to maintain rioting, and drunk|enne&s;s, right in the face of Gods commands, for even kings are not to make them&s;elves rich beyond bounds with the peoples money, &s;ee <HI>Deut.</HI> 17.17. <HI>Neither &s;hall he greatly multiply to him&s;elf &s;ilver and gold.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, there is no doubt but that kings and rulers ought to have a rea&s;onable and honorable recompence for their labor, See <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.6. <HI>For this cau&s;e pay you tribute al&s;o for they are God's mini&s;ters, attending continually upon this very thing.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould think it proper, under this enquiry, for us to con&s;ider the conduct of the children of I&s;rael, and &s;ee wherein they were blamed, and when they were not: For God is the &s;ame, ye&s;terday, to day, and forever? Therefore tho&s;e things that were di&s;plea&s;ing to him then, are di&s;plea&s;ing to him now if they are acted. And I do not remember any threatening again&s;t the children of I&s;|rael for inju&s;tice, untill after Solomon's time&punc; the que&s;ti|on will then be, How did they conduct in that time? &s;ee <HI>Deut.</HI> 24.10. <HI>When thou do&s;t lend thy brother any thing,
<PB N="10" REF="043211_0010_101CD6AD18141FA0">
thou &s;halt not go unto his hou&s;e to fetch his pledge.</HI> Did they indeed when they &s;old, or lent one another any thing, take a pledge as a witne&s;s to the debt? I an&s;wer, Doubt|le&s;s they did; or what is the meaning of a pledge. Wherefore it is evident they took care beforehand to know how to do ju&s;tice. But &s;ee <HI>Deut.</HI> 24.12, 13. <HI>And if the man be poor, thou &s;halt not &s;leep with his pledge: In any ca&s;e thou &s;halt deliver him the pledge again when the &s;un goeth down.</HI></P>
<P>Why truly did they not tru&s;t one another longer than from morning to night; for what profit could a pledge be that mu&s;t be given up before the debt was paid. I an&s;wer, That the creditor could &s;how the pledge to a number of the neighbours, and thereby git witne&s;&s;es that the debtor owes for goods delivered? In that ca&s;e a cre|ditor might recover his cau&s;e, or el&s;e it was lo&s;t, for what advantage was it to have a pledge or witne&s;&s;es; if a per&s;on could recover upon his own &s;ay &s;o, or by making a fal&s;e book, and &s;ware it was truly and ju&s;tly charg'd, nor could they make a book again&s;t any per&s;on for four times &s;o much as the debtor would have given a pledge for; nor for things for which &s;atisfaction had been made. Should they not have been as realy puni&s;hed had they had no law to prevent making fal&s;e accompts, as they were for not having law, or judges, to prevent the wickedne&s;s done to the Levites wife; werefore they did well to take care beforehand, that one &s;hould not defraud or wrong another. If we can find in their practice, what was the mind and will of God, let us hear it. But to return; It is probable, when per&s;ons thought them&s;elves wronged, and could git no pledge; they went immediately to trial. I &s;hall here produce the account of an action that was brought and tried in one of their courts, pre&s;ent, king Solomon judge, 1. <HI>Kings,</HI> 3.16, <HI>to the end. Then came there two women that were harlots, unto the king, and &s;tood before him: and the one woman &s;aid, O my lord, I, and this womam dwell in one
<PB N="11" REF="043211_0011_101CD6AEA7F533C8">
hou&s;e; and I was delivered of a child with her in the hou&s;e: and it came to pa&s;s, the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered al&s;o, and we were together: there was no &s;tranger with us in the hou&s;e; &s;ave we two in the hou&s;e. And this woman's child died in the night, becau&s;e &s;he overlaid it. And &s;he aro&s;e at mid-night and took my &s;on from be&s;ide me, while thine hand-maid &s;lept, and laid it in her bo&s;om, and laid her dead child in my bo&s;om; and when I ro&s;e in the morning to give my child &s;uck, behold it was dead; but when I had con&s;idered it in the morning, behold it was not my &s;on which I did bear: and the other woman &s;aid nay; but the living is my &s;on, and the dead is thy &s;on: and this &s;aid no, but the dead is thy &s;on, and the living is my &s;on. Thus they &s;poke before the king. Then &s;aid the king, the one &s;aith this is my &s;on that liveth, and thy &s;on is the dead: and the other &s;aith nay; but thy &s;on is the dead, and my &s;on is the living. And the king &s;aid bring me a &s;word, and they brought a &s;word before the king; and the king &s;aid divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. Then &s;pake the woman who&s;e the living child was, unto the king (for her bowels yearned upon her &s;on) and &s;he &s;aid, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wi&s;e &s;lay it: But the other &s;aid, let it be neither mine, nor thine, but divide it. Then the king an&s;wered and &s;aid, give her the living child, and in no wi&s;e &s;lay it; &s;he is the mother thereof. And all I&s;rael heard of the judgment which the ksng had judged, and they feared the king; for they &s;aw that the wi&s;|dom of God was in him to do judgment.</HI></P>
<P>Here ob&s;erve, we have no account of any writ, or any officer to bring the defendant before the king, for it like|ly was looked upon as a token of guilt, to be unwilling to attend the court: we have no account of any attorney to abate the writ, or plead demuror, or &s;pecial plea; nor even to &s;ay, that the plantiff had produced no witne&s;s to prove her cau&s;e; neither could they go from court, to court, untill they had &s;pent in the trial, three times &s;o

much as the cau&s;e was worth: But the judge hears the &s;tory from the parties, and by policy finds out from them which was the true mother, and orders, that &s;he &s;hould have her own child.</P>
<P>But where lay the great wi&s;dom think you; was it in judging that a woman &s;hould have her own child, or in &s;erching the matter.</P>
<P>See what is &s;poken by Job, who &s;eems to have been a judge: <HI>chap.</HI> 29.16. <HI>I was a father to the poor, and the cau&s;e which I knew not, I &s;earched out. I break the jaws of the wicked, and pluck the &s;poile out of his teeth.</HI></P>
<P>But from Solomons time, to their going into captivity, there are repeated threatenings for inju&s;tice, and violence, &s;ee <HI>Micah.</HI> 2.1. <HI>Woe to them that devi&s;e iniquity, and work evil upon their beds: when the morning is light, they practice it becau&s;e it is in the power of their hands&mdash;And they covet fields, and take them by violence, and hou&s;es, and take them away: &s;o they oppre&s;s a man and his hou&s;e, even a man and his heritage:&mdash;Therefore, thus &s;aith the Lord; Behold again&s;t this family do I devi&s;e an evil, from which ye &s;hall not remove your necks:</HI> &s;ee al&s;o <HI>Jer.</HI> 22.3. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord; Execute ye judgmdnt, and righteou&s;ne&s;s; and de|liver the &s;poiled out of the hands of the oppre&s;&s;or; and do no wrong; do no violence to the &s;tranger, the fatherle&s;s, nor the widow; neither &s;hed innocent blood in this place; for if you do this thing, indeed then &s;hall there enter in by the gates of this hou&s;e, kings &s;etting upon the throne of David rideing in chariots, and on hor&s;es, he, and his &s;ervants, and his people. But if ye will not hear the&s;e words, I &s;ware by my &s;elf, &s;aith the Lord; That this hou&s;e &s;hall become a de&s;olation.</HI></P>
<P>But did they do all this inju&s;tice, and violence, with|out any pretence of law? No, they did not; for we read, <HI>Micah,</HI> 6.16. <HI>For the &s;tatutes of Omry are kept, and all the works of the hou&s;e of Ahab</HI>; and <HI>Hab.</HI> 1.4. <HI>Therefore the law is &s;lacked, and judgment doth never go forth, for the wicked doth compa&s;s about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="043211_0013_101CD6B40235C3F0">But what was their law do you think; was it like a fi&s;h-net, that would catch all the little fi&s;h, and let all the great fi&s;h go through? I an&s;wer yes; it probibly was: but you will a&s;k, how can that be? I an&s;wer, That under a plau&s;able pretence of doing ju&s;tice; that when either partiy thought them&s;elves wronged, they might revew or appeal, from court, to court; untill they had &s;pent three times &s;o much in the trial, as the cau&s;e was worth. The great men, by having very large fees for manageing the cau&s;es, probably run off with the mo&s;t of the money, while they left the poor to &s;uffer for want. Who having recovered hardly enough to pay the co&s;t, they lo&s;t all that was taken from them by inju&s;tice, or violence: How did this deliver the <HI>&s;poiled.</HI> And when any one per&s;on did inju&s;tice, or violence to another, he was obliged to go to law, or loo&s;e his right; and who knows but what that was next to his life; was not the nation guilty of this. And what were they better to to have a law which co&s;t more than could be recovered by it; could it relieve a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed per&s;on who had been wronged by inju&s;tice or violence. But if the righteous lo&s;t all, what become of the mi&s;taken party, who likely lo&s;t more than three times all: Was not &s;uch a law, like an iron brier, that tore the fle&s;h off every one that came near it: wherefore every mite of co&s;t that was made in trials more than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, was unju&s;t; no better than other inju&s;tice. Let us conclude this point, with the&s;e words, 2. <HI>Chro.</HI> 19.6. <HI>To the judg|es, Take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment.</HI> And who&s;o|ever &s;hall break any one of the laws of God, they alone &s;hall bear it: for if a people &s;hall have no law to pun|i&s;h the breaking any of the&s;e commandments, this is the natural tendency to bring them to ruin, as has been ob&s;erved before; if a people &s;hall carefully puni&s;h the breakers of the&s;e commands, it is &s;trange if any one

e&s;capes without puni&s;hment, &s;hame, and di&s;grace; how|ever, they will certainly be under the cur&s;e, &s;ee <HI>Deut.</HI> 27.26. <HI>Cur&s;ed be he that confermeth not all the words of this law, to do them; and all the people &s;hall &s;ay amen.</HI> Ob&s;erve the word conferm; for all are required to confirm this law. Therefore, here is a cur&s;e pronounced again&s;t every one who has a right to chu&s;e rulers who doth not endeavour to chu&s;e &s;uch as will be mo&s;t likely to keep this law.</P>
<P>Here is a cur&s;e pronounced again&s;t every one who doth not endeavor to know what rulers do not do well in keeping this law; who &s;hall throw away his power, or doth not endeavor to di&s;place, or leave out &s;uch rul|ers as do not do well in keeping this law. Here is a cur&s;e pronounced again&s;t every one who although he has not a right to chu&s;e rulers eye or ear who &s;hall do any thing which he knows is likely to hinder the keeping this law. Here is a cur&s;e pronounced again&s;t every judge or other who &s;hall not endeavor the keeping this law. In fine, here is a cur&s;e pronounced again&s;t all the breakers of this law: and who hath ever hardened him&s;elf again&s;t his creator, and hath pro&s;pered; therefore, every one that &s;corneth he alone &s;hall bear it. But what &s;hall he bear? I an&s;wer, That who&s;oever &s;hall &s;corn to obey the law of God, &s;hall bear his wrath and di&s;plea&s;ure. See what (if it be practiced) will be an in&s;tance of this, <HI>Exod.</HI> 22.22. <HI>Ye &s;hall not afflict any widow, or fatherle&s;s child; if thou afflict them in any wi&s;e, and they cry at all unto me, I will &s;urely hear their cry; and my wrath &s;hall wax hot, and I will kill you with the &s;word; and your wives &s;hall be widows, and your children fatherle&s;s.</HI> And I have have heard there is a di&s;temper among the nati|ons, which is the mo&s;t dreadfull and mortal to the well people, for when a number of men &s;hall make unju&s;t rules, they will not only enjoy the di&s;plea&s;ure of God, but they, and their's mu&s;t be tried by the &s;ame law, &s;ee <HI>Prov.</HI> 28.10. <HI>Who&s;o cau&s;eth the righteous to go a&s;tray in

evil way, he &s;hall fall him&s;elf into his own pit; but the up|right &s;hall hvae good things in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: and Job,</HI> 18.8. <HI>For he is ca&s;t into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a &s;nare.</HI> I remember an old ob&s;ervation that has been maid; That when the children of I&s;rael had good rulers, to whom they heard &s;o much as that they could execute the laws, they always pro&s;pered; on the other hand, when they had bad rulers, to whom they heared, then they &s;uffered greatly: and tho&s;e rulers fared the wor&s;t, witne&s;s Jereboam, Jehoiachim Baa&s;ha, and Ahab. I con|clude this point with that in <HI>Job,</HI> 27.8. <HI>For what is the hope of a hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when God taketh away his &s;oul.</HI></P>
<P>And now let us conclude this part, with a word of exhortation to the hearers. As we are probationers here, for eternity: Let us &s;et apart &s;ome time in every day, wherein to con&s;ider &s;olemnly what will become of us in another world; and if we are in any di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ee that the rod of God is upon us; let us mi&s;tru&s;t whether there be not &s;omething in our practice that we have over|look't, that is offen&s;ive to an holy God. Let us &s;eek to God by fa&s;ting and prayer, to teach us what is ami&s;s: &s;ee the example of David, when there was three years famine year after year; and David enquired of the Lord, 2. <HI>Samuel,</HI> 21.1. Let us examine carefully how our actions agree with the rules of the word of God, &s;ee <HI>Zach.</HI> 7.7. <HI>Should ye not hear the words which the Lord hath cried by the former prophets</HI>: and whatever is ami&s;s let us reform, and re&s;tore righteou&s;ne&s;s; then by fa&s;ting and prayer &s;eek to God for forgivene&s;s, and mercy; who can tell if God will direct, and pro&s;per our enter|pri&s;es, or find a way of redemption, that we peri&s;h not. I conclude the whole, with that in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 50.10. <HI>Who is a|mong you that feareth the Lord; that walketh in darkne&s;s, and hath no light: Let him tru&s;t in the name of the Lord, and &s;tay upon his God.</HI></P>
