<P><HI>We have, in the pre&s;ent age, many &s;triking examples of this kind. The names of Barbauld and Genlis will be &s;ufficient to prove this, al|though with them many others might undoubtedly claim that im|mortal honour, which the union of genius with virtue ought always to be&s;tow.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE BLIND CHILD.</HEAD>
<P>MR. WYNDHAM, of who&s;e family I am about to relate &s;ome Anecdotes, was an eminent mer|chant. He married an amiable woman, by whom he had four children. Their re&s;idence, dur|ing the winter, was in one of the be&s;t &s;treets in the city of London, and in the &s;ummer months, at his fine e&s;tate in the country, on which he had built an elegant hou&s;e, and where the
<PB N="10" REF="047559_0008_1023C4983A289490">
riches his indu&s;try, and that of his father, had gained, were part|ly employed in decorating his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rounds, and partly di&s;tributed with a liberal hand among the neighbouring poor. But it is not of Mr. Wyndham only I mean to &s;peak, though his bene|volence, his probity, and vari|ous virtues, might well employ a more able hi&s;torian than my|&s;elf. It is true, he will &s;ometimes appear to great advantage in the following pages: but &s;ince I ad|dre&s;s my&s;elf to a yout<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> cla&s;s of readers, it is pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e they will be more intere&s;ted in what re&s;pects his children. It is their di&s;po&s;itions, their co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">duct, their manners, I mean to de&s;cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and Mr. Wyndham will appear in a more amiable light as their fa|ther than any other. As a good mother too, Mrs. Wyndham will,
<PB N="11" REF="047559_0009_1023C408C91466E0">
I doubt not, excite many grate|ful compari&s;ons in my young friends, who will read in her cha|racter tho&s;e virtues which have been exerted by their own mo|thers; and not one &s;entiment of regret will, I hope, be awaken|ed by a review of her actions, except in that feeling youthful bo&s;om, which mourns the lo&s;s of an indulgent parent.</P>
<P>Mr. Wyndham's elde&s;t child was a daughter, named Emily. She was, at the time when this hi&s;tory commences, ju&s;t turned of fourteen, and at that age gave promi&s;e of every amiable and virtuous quality; I &s;ay gave <HI>pro|mi&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e at that time of life, the character cannot be decided. Neither had &s;he been injudiciou&s;|ly brought forward according to the fa&s;hion of the times, which, ha&s;tening the &s;ummer of life,
<PB N="12" REF="047559_0010_1023C410C2292578">
&s;hortens the &s;pring, and con&s;e|quently denies a proper time for the unfolding of the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lken bud, and forces an immature fruit, neither fair to the &s;ight, nor plea&s;ing to the ta&s;te. This re|flection, excited by my &s;ubject, may, I hope, be excu&s;ed; for, &s;hould my young readers pa&s;s it over as unimportant <HI>now,</HI> it may hereafter recur to their memory, as neither untrue nor uninter|e&s;ting.</P>
<P>Emily, with a form of the mo&s;t delicate order, had been accu&s;|tomed &s;o early to habits of in|du&s;try and exerci&s;e, that her frame had acquired a &s;trength which nature had denied, and her countenance a bloom, which en|livened it with the mo&s;t graceful vivacity. She was not a beauty, but &s;he was perfectly agreeable. Her healthy appearance, her in|telligent

and mode&s;t &s;mile, the ingen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ious candour that &s;hone in her eyes, gave he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> charms infi|nitely preferable to a cold regu|larity of features, becau&s;e they were graces which ro&s;e from the heart, and could not have ex|i&s;ted without a corre&s;ponding &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition. In the mild countenance and elegant manners of Emily, you might read the excellence of her tem|per, and the intelligence of her &s;oul. In her eyes, as in a mir|ror, you &s;aw reflected every mo|tion of her heart: &s;he was with|out di&s;gui&s;e; and her natural graces were infinitely preferable to any which art and affectation could have taught her. But her character will reveal it&s;elf; and my young readers, tho' charm|ed with Emily, may be impatient to hear more of her brother

and &s;i&s;ters. Mrs. Wyndham's &s;econd child was a &s;on, near twelve years of age. He was named Arthur, and he de&s;erved equally with Emily the affection of his parents. He was natural|ly of a bold, impetuous di&s;po&s;i|tion, which they had taken the utmo&s;t pains to keep within due bounds, and had &s;o far &s;ucceed|ed, that, except in a very few in&s;tances, his behaviour was per|fectly becoming. Sometimes, in|deed, his natural impatience &s;ub|jected him to inconvenience; but that Mr. and Mrs. Wyndham did not much regret, becau&s;e it &s;erved to convince him how right they were, when they warned him again&s;t yielding to the ea|gerne&s;s of his temper. He had an excellent &s;en&s;e, great tender|ne&s;s of heart, and a mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">c|tionate di&s;po&s;ition, which &s;how|ed

affliction! with what angui&s;h did they perceive the impo&s;&s;ibility of giving her equal advantages of education with their other chil|dren! with what ardour did they pray for the re&s;toration of her &s;ight.</P>
<P>The younge&s;t child was al&s;o a girl. She was about &s;even years old, and was named Maria. She was very pretty, very gentle, and &s;weet in her temper, and entire|ly the favourite of all the fami|ly. Thus would Mr. and Mrs. Wyndham have been completely happy in their children, but for the misfortune of poor Helen; for which, however, they were partly con&s;oled, by the tender|ne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion it excited in her brother and &s;i&s;ters. At the time I have cho&s;en for the com|mencement of the&s;e Anecdotes, Mr. Wyndham's family had ju&s;t

pa&s;&s;ed the winter in London, and were preparing for their remove to Belle-Ville, their &s;eat in the country. The children were all extremely rejoiced and delighted with the thoughts of &s;o plea&s;ing an exchange. They were all bu|&s;ily employed in packing up their cloaths, except Helen, who &s;at on a window &s;eat in the nur&s;ery, attending to their conver&s;ation.</P>

its dimen&s;ions were proportion|ably &s;mall.

At length the heavy minute; de|parted, and the &s;ame &s;cene was again pre&s;ented to her view. And now the mirror had for that day lo&s;t its power, and in vain El|frida wept and rejected &s;leep. Ere the night was &s;pent, an expre&s;s arrived, who brought letters from the Baron.

<HEAD>THE STORY of MR. WENTWORTH. From the MIRROR, No. 27. [A periodical Paper, very de&s;erving of at|tention.]</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>There is a kind of mournful eloquence
In thy dumb grief, which &s;hames all clamorous &s;orrow.</Q>
<BIBL>LEE'S THEODOSIUS.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A VERY amiable and much re&s;pected friend of mine, who&s;e real name I &s;hall conceal under that of <HI>Wentworth,</HI> had lately the
<PB N="178" REF="047559_0176_1023C5808ADCF5C8">
misfortune of lo&s;ing a wife, who was not only peculiarly beauti|ful, but who&s;e &s;oul was the man|&s;ion of every virtue, and of every elegant accompli&s;hment. She was &s;uddenly cut off in the flower of her age, after having lived twelve years with the be&s;t and mo&s;t af|fectionate of hu&s;bands. A perfect &s;imilarity of temper and di&s;po|&s;ition, a kindred delicacy of ta&s;te and &s;entiment, had linked their hearts together in early youth, and each &s;ucceeding year &s;eemed but to add new &s;trength to their affection. Though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an affluent fortune, they pre|ferred the tranquillity of the country to all the gay plea&s;ures of the capital. In the cultiva|tion of their e&s;tate, in che|ri&s;hing the virtuous indu&s;try of its inhabitants, in ornamenting a beautiful &s;eat, in the &s;ociety of
<PB N="179" REF="047559_0177_1023C58343364018">
one another, in the innocent prat|tle of their little children, and in the company of a few friends, Mr <HI>Wentworth</HI> and his <HI>Amelia</HI> found every wi&s;h gratified, and their happine&s;s complete.</P>
<P>My readers will judge then, what mu&s;t have been Mr. <HI>Went|worth'</HI>s feelings, when <HI>Amelia</HI> was thus &s;uddenly torn from him, in the very prime of her life, and in the mid&s;t of her felicity. I dreaded the effects of it upon a mind of his nice and delicate &s;en|&s;ibility: and, receiving a letter from his brother, reque&s;ting me to come to them, I ha&s;ted thi|ther, to endeavour by my pre|&s;ence, to a&s;&s;uage his grief, and prevent tho&s;e fatal con&s;equences of which I was &s;o apprehen&s;ive.</P>
<P>As I approached the hou&s;e, the &s;ight of all the well-known
<PB N="180" REF="047559_0178_1023C5866DE2B828">
&s;cenes, brought fre&s;h into my mind the remembrance of <HI>Ame|lia;</HI> and I felt my&s;elf but ill qual|ified to act the part of a comfort|er. When my carriage &s;topt at the gate, I trembled, and would have given the world to go back. A heartfelt &s;orrow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at on the countenance of every &s;ervant; and I walked into the hou&s;e with|out a word being uttered. In the hall I was met by the old b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ler, who was grown grey headed in the family, and he ha&s;tened to conduct me up &s;tairs.&mdash;As I walked up, I commanded firm|ne&s;s enough to &s;ay, <Q>Well, Wil|liam, how is Mr. Wentworth&punc;</Q> The old man, turning about with a look that pierced my heart, &s;aid, <Q>Oh, Sir, our excellent Lady!</Q>&mdash;Here his grief overwhelmed him; and it was with difficulty he was able to open
<PB N="181" REF="047559_0179_1023C5892B925BA0">
to me the door of the apartment.</P>
<P>Mr. Wentworth ran and em|braced me with the warme&s;t af|fection; and, after a few mo|ments, a&s;&s;umed a firmne&s;s, and even an ea&s;e, that &s;urpri&s;ed me. His brother, with a &s;i&s;ter of Ame|lia's, and &s;ome other friends that were in the room, appeared more over powered than my friend him|&s;elf, who, by the fortitude of his behaviour, &s;eemed rather to mo|derate the grief of tho&s;e around him, than to demand their com|pa&s;&s;ion for him&s;elf. By his gen|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> and kind attentions, he &s;eem|ed anxious to relieve their &s;or|row; and, by a &s;ort of concerted traquillity, &s;trove to prevent their di&s;covering any &s;ymptoms of the bitter angui&s;h which preyed up|on his mind. His countenance was pale, and his eyes betrayed
<PB N="182" REF="047559_0180_1023C58BB6DF7C40">
that his heart was ill at ea&s;e; but it was that &s;ilent and maje&s;|tic &s;orrow which commands our reverence and our admiration.</P>
<P>The next morning after break|fa&s;t, I chanced to take up a vo|lume of Meta&s;ta&s;io, that lay among&s;t other books upon a ta|ble; and, as I was turning over the leaves, a &s;lip of paper, with &s;omething written on it, dropped upon the floor.&mdash;Mr. Went|worth picked it up; and as he looked at it, I &s;aw the tears &s;tart from his eyes, and, fetching a deep &s;igh, he uttered, in a low and broken voice, <HI>"My poor Amelia!"</HI>&mdash;It was the tran&s;lation of a favourite pa&s;&s;age which &s;he had been attempting, but had left unfini&s;hed. As if unea&s;y le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t I had perceived his emotion, he carele&s;sly threw his arm over my
<PB N="183" REF="047559_0181_1023C58D3A4DD7A0">
&s;houlder, and reading aloud a few lines of the page which I held open in my hand, he went into &s;ome remarks on the poe|try of that elegant author.&mdash;Sometime after, I ob&s;erved him take up the book, and carefully replacing the &s;lip of paper where it had been, put the volume into his pocket.</P>
<P>Mr. Wentworth propo&s;ed that we &s;hould walk out, and that he him&s;elf would accompany us. As we &s;tepped through the hall, one of my friend's younge&s;t boys came running up, and catching his Papa by the hand, cried out with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oy, that <HI><Q>Mam|ma's Rover was returned</Q></HI> This was a &s;paniel, who had been the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">avourite of Amelia, and had followed her in all her walks; but after her death, had been
<PB N="184" REF="047559_0182_1023C59017B50FB0">
&s;ent to the hou&s;e of a villager, to be out of the immediate &s;ight of the family. Having &s;omehow made his e&s;cape from thence, the dog had that morning found his way home; and, as &s;oon as he &s;aw Mr. Wentworth, leaped upon him with an exce&s;s of fond|ne&s;s. I &s;aw my friend's lips and cheeks quiver. He catched his little Frank in his arms; and, for a few moments, hid his face in his neck.</P>
<P>As we traver&s;ed his delightful grounds, many different &s;cenes naturally recalled the remem|brance of Amelia. My friend, indeed, in order to avoid &s;ome of her favourite walks, had con|ducted us an unu&s;ual road; but what corner could be found that did not bear the traces of her hand? Her elegant ta&s;te had
<PB N="185" REF="047559_0183_1023C594C3080FE0">
marked the peculiar beauty of each different &s;cene, and had brought it forth to view with &s;uch a happy delicacy of art, as to make it &s;eem the work of na|ture alone. As we cro&s;&s;ed cer|tain paths in the woods, and pa&s;&s;ed by &s;ome ru&s;tic buildings, I could &s;ometimes di&s;cern an emotion in my friend's co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nte|nance; but he in&s;tantly &s;tifled it with a firmne&s;s and dignity that made me careful not to &s;eem to ob&s;erve it.</P>
<P>Towards night, Mr. Went|worth having &s;tolen out of the room, his brother and I &s;tep|ped out to a terrace behind the hou&s;e. It was the du&s;k of the evening, the air was mild and &s;erene, and the moon was ri&s;ing in all her brightne&s;s from the cloud of the ca&s;t. The finene&s;s
<PB N="186" REF="047559_0184_1023C597999AB3E8">
of the night made us extend our walk, and we &s;trayed into a hollow valley, who&s;e &s;ides are covered with trees overhanging a brook that pours it&s;elf along over broken rocks. We ap|proached a ru&s;tic grotto, plac|ed in a &s;eque&s;tered corner, un|der a half-impending rock. My companion &s;topped. "This," &s;aid he, <Q>was one of Amelia's walks, and that grotto was her favourite evening retreat. The la&s;t night &s;he ever walk|ed out, and the very evening &s;he caught that fatal fever, I was with my brother and her, while we &s;at and read to each other in that very place.</Q>&mdash;While he &s;poke, we perceiv|ed a man &s;teal out of the grot|to, and, avoiding us, take his way by a path through a thick|et
<PB N="187" REF="047559_0185_1023A162D3CA0E28">
of trees on the other &s;ide. "It is my brother," &s;aid young Wentworth; <Q>he has been here in his Amelia's favourite grove, indulging that grief he &s;o carefully conceals from us.</Q></P>
<P>We returned to the hou&s;e, and found Mr. Wentworth with the re&s;t of the company. He forc|ed on &s;ome conver&s;ation, and even affected a degree of gentle plea&s;antry during the whole evening.</P>
<P>Such, in &s;hort, is the noble de|portment of my friend, that, in place of finding it nece&s;&s;ary to temper and moderate his grief, I mu&s;t avoid &s;eeming to per|ceive it, and dare &s;carcely ap|pear even to think of the heavy calamity which has befallen him. I too well know what he feels; but the more I know this, the
<PB N="188" REF="047559_0186_1023C59D68850430">
more does the dignity of his re|collection and fortitude excite my admiration, and command my &s;ilent attention and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>How very different is this dig|nified and re&s;erved &s;orrow, from that weak and teazing grief which di&s;gu&s;ts, by its &s;ighs and tears, and clamorous lamentati|ons? How much does &s;uch no|ble fortitude of deportment call forth our regard and reverence? How much is a character in other re&s;pects e&s;timable, degra|ded by a contrary demeanor? How much does the exce&s;&s;ive, the importunate, and unmanly grief of <HI>Cicero,</HI> dimini&s;h the ve|ry high re&s;pect which we &s;hould otherwi&s;e entertain for the ex|alted character of that illu&s;trious Roman?</P>
<P>Writers on practical morality
<PB N="189" REF="047559_0187_1023C5A05E419330">
have de&s;cribed and analyzed the pa&s;&s;ion of grief, and have pre|tended to pre&s;cribe remedies for re&s;toring the mind to tranquilli|ty; but, I believe, little benefit has been derived from any thing they have advi&s;ed. To tell a per&s;on in grief, that time will relieve him, is truly applying no remedy; and to bid him reflect how many others there may be who are more wretched, is a very inefficacious one. The truth is, that the exce&s;s of this, as well as of other pa&s;&s;ions, mu&s;t be prevented rather than cured. It mu&s;t be obviated, by our at|taining that evenne&s;s and equali|ty of temper, which can ari&s;e only from an improved under|&s;tanding, and an habitual inter|cour&s;e with refined &s;ociety. The&s;e will not, indeed, exempt
<PB N="190" REF="047559_0188_1023C5A1E3453878">
us from the pangs of &s;orrow, but will enable us to bear them with a noble grace and proprie|ty, and will render the pre&s;ence of our friends (which is the on|ly remedy) a very effectual cure.</P>
<P>This is well explained by a philo&s;opher, who is no le&s;s elo|quent than he is profound. He ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that we natural|ly, on all occa&s;ions, endeavour to bring down our own pa&s;&s;ions, to that pitch which tho&s;e about us can corre&s;pond with. We view our&s;elves in the light in which we think they view us, and &s;eek to &s;uit our behaviour to what we think their feelings can go along with. With an intimate friend, acquainted with every circum&s;tance of our &s;itu|ation, we can, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, give way to our grief, but are
<PB N="191" REF="047559_0189_1023C5A4B48E6438">
more calm than when by our|&s;elves. Before a common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|quaintance, we a&s;&s;ume a greater &s;edatene&s;s. Before a mixed a&s;|&s;embly, we affect a &s;till more con&s;iderable degree of compo|&s;ure. Thus, by the company of our friends at fir&s;t, and af|terwards, by mingling with &s;o|ciety, we come to &s;uit our de|portment to what we think they will approve of; we gradually abate the violence of our pa&s;&s;ion, and re&s;tore our mind to its wont|ed tranquillity.</P>
