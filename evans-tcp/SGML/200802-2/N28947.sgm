<P><HI>CUSTOM has long e&s;tabli&s;hed the right of dramati&s;ts to a property in the plots and characters of noveli&s;ts; and recent in&s;tances might be adduced of novels and romances&punc; which were &s;carcely &s;uffered to be read, ere they were con|verted into dramas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The equal</HI> right <HI>of the noveli&s;t to &s;imilar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> tre&s;pa&s;&s;es upon dramatic ground cannot be conte&s;ted: whether the</HI> exerci&s;e <HI>of that right, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, will be as favourably received by the public, their voice can alone determine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As there may be tho&s;e, however, who acceding the que&s;|tion of right, yet marvel at the author's ta&s;te in the &s;election or &s;o hacknied a &s;ubject, he begs leave to &s;tate the motive of his choice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Having been &s;o fortunate, as to be pre&s;ent at Mrs. Sid|dons's performance of Milwood, he was &s;o agreeably &s;urpri|&s;ed by the novel, yet ju&s;t colouring, which that lady's incompa|rable talents gave to a character, till then deemed in&s;ignifi|cant, that he determined, perhaps ra&s;hly, upon the pre&s;ent un|dertaking.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Such readers, as have &s;een Milwood per&s;onated in the u&s;ual manner</HI> only, <HI>will conclude, that the copy attempted in the following &s;heets, differs too much from the vulgar open|ne&s;s of character they have been accu&s;tomed to a&s;&s;ociate with the original. Such as have &s;een Mrs. Siddons's per|formance, will, he humbly conceives, form a contrary opin|ion: and he re&s;ts perfectly at ea&s;e as to the deci&s;ion of the be&s;t judges re&s;pecting the preference he has yielded to</HI> her <HI>delineation of Milwood, who&s;e mo&s;t extraordinary powers are only equalled by the ju&s;t di&s;crimination, which directs their di&s;play.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The author has deviated in &s;everal in&s;tances from the &s;tory he has adopted; has introduced &s;ome new characters, and changed the features of others; yet as the chief incidents are pre&s;erved, he thought it more candid to retain the origi|nal title, than to invent a new one.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Of his own production, he would only ob&s;erve, that he</HI> be|lieves <HI>the de&s;ign is novel, and re&s;pectfully &s;ubmits it to the world, merely as the exerci&s;e of a mind &s;omewhat contem|plative, in tho&s;e evening hours of lei&s;ure, which the duties of a humble de&s;tination in life occa&s;ionally afford him; and by no means as the effort of a competitor for literary fame.</HI></P>

<Q><L>As into air the purer &s;pirits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low,</L>

<L>So flew the &s;oul to it's congenial place.</L>
<BIBL>POPE</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE eye that has witne&s;&s;ed the peaceful depar|ture of a ju&s;t man's &s;pirit in the pre&s;ence of affectionate relatives, and revering friends, has be|held a &s;pectacle &s;olemnly delightful, and awfully in|tere&s;ting, beyond all power of de&s;cription.&mdash;On &s;uch occa&s;ions the heart tru&s;ts not to the tongue's feeble utterance, but ru&s;hing to the countenance, there de|lineates its emotion in a language without words. Such was the &s;cene at the rectory of Hanworth: its worthy incumbent had heard with re&s;ignation, the opinion of his phy&s;ician, that no human means could &s;ave him. Mortification had advanced almo&s;t to it's la&s;t &s;tage. Yet, though he felt no pangs of guilt, no dread of future worlds, though perfectly re&s;igned to die, there were attractions, who&s;e re&s;i&s;tle&s;s&punc; force &s;till held his wi&s;hes for a longer life&mdash;Around that couch, from which he never was to ri&s;e, knelt objects that had awakened in his brea&s;t, the fine&s;t feelings of an hu&s;band, father, friend.</P>
<P>The amiable woman, who at an early age had given him her hand, and with it the worthie&s;t of hearts, too deeply afflicted to weep, gazed alternate|ly
<PB N="8" REF="038596_0007_10129E16F1D3BCC0">
on her expiring husband, and on tho&s;e, who were &s;o &s;oon to be the orphan pledges of his love, with the &s;oul-piercing wildne&s;s of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Their &s;on, a youth of &s;ixteen, held his father's hand cla&s;ped firmly betwixt both his own, and bent his face over it to conceal his tears.</P>
<P>A daughter, &s;omewhat younger, with tears and &s;welling &s;ighs mingled ejaculations to the Deity to &s;pare a life &s;o dear.</P>
<P>Leaning his head again&s;t the feet-po&s;ts of the bed &s;tood Dr. Hill, the benevolent friend and &s;kilful phy|&s;ician of the rector, who&s;e &s;erene countenance he appeared contemplating with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>"I could have wi&s;hed he had arrived&mdash;I &s;hould have retired from the &s;cenes of this life with le&s;s regret, had I committed the&s;e my only cares to his kind keeping" faintly uttered Mr. Barnwell. "But his own good heart," continued he, "will &s;ugge&s;t to him all I could have &s;aid."</P>
<P>It was his brother to whom he alluded, who en|tered the room as he was &s;peaking. His appearance changed the &s;cene.&mdash;Mrs. Barnwell, Eliza, and George, clung round his knees, and &s;eemed to hail him as the me&s;&s;enger of joy: but it was a momentary joy. Sir James had been anxiou&s;ly expected, and his arrival as it ended that anxiety, occa&s;ioned a momentary impul&s;e of plea&s;ure. But no &s;ooner did the melan|choly cau&s;e of his vi&s;it recur, than &s;ilence and &s;or|row en&s;ued.</P>
<P>Sir James, after a pau&s;e, approached his dying brother, and an affecting farewell took place. Tears rolled down the pallid cheek of the worthy rector, as he pre&s;&s;ed his brother's hand, and ca&s;t a meaning look upon his family. He &s;unk exhau&s;ted on his pillow.</P>
<P>"Think of this world no more, my brother," &s;aid Sir James: "from this moment this is my wife&mdash;the&s;e are my children&mdash;and all I have is their's!"</P>
<P>"My God! I thank thee," exclaimed the Rector and expired.</P>

<P>WHEN the fir&s;t effu&s;ion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orrow for the lo&s;s of friends is exhau&s;ted, and grief begins to li&s;ten to the voice of rea&s;on, there are certain arguments which cu&s;tom, almo&s;t invariably&punc; applies on &s;uch occa&s;ions; &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that&mdash;"we mu&s;t all die,"&mdash;that "our lo&s;s is the gain"&mdash;that "&s;orrow is u&s;ele&s;s, and tears cannot re&s;tore them to us."</P>
<P>Sometimes it happens that Prudence &s;teps kind|ly in with &s;ome &s;uch coun&s;el as this&mdash;"that though a hu&s;band, or a father, is gone, it is a comfortable con&s;ideration that his widow or his children enjoy the fruits of his indu&s;try and oeconomy; and that, in&s;tead of grieving for a calamity that is pa&s;t, it were better to rejoice in the ble&s;&s;ings that remain."</P>
<P>Such are the reflections that &s;ooth the brea&s;ts of many an heir, and many a widow, beneath the &s;able &s;hew of &s;orrow; who oft times by their cheerful countenance, wi&s;ely endeavour to di&s;&s;ipate the gloom occa&s;ioned by the e&s;cutcheon that darkens the win|dow of their ball room, and the black equipage that conveys them to the opera&mdash;
<Q><L>Thus bear about the mockery of woe</L>
<L>To midnight dances and the public &s;how.</L></Q></P>
<P>The family of the Barnwells, inheriting from the rector little el&s;e than his good name, were in no dan|ger of in&s;ulting his memory by a joyful di&s;play of
<PB N="10" REF="038596_0009_10129E1E10726748">
his wealth; nor would their grief have been le&s;&s;ened by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of thou&s;ands. Every branch of this bereaved family was &s;en&s;ible of the lo&s;s it had &s;u&s;tained, and felt, when the violence of grief was abated, a regret more calm indeed, but not le&s;s &s;orrowful.</P>
<P>Sir James was, perhaps, the individual among them who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, was the lea&s;t affected: not that the knight was deficient in tho&s;e feelings which are the honourable appendages of humanity, but he was older than Mrs. Barnwell by at lea&s;t ten years, and had &s;pent the greater part of his life in a counting hou&s;e, and on the Royal Exchange; which, though certainly the &s;chools where indu&s;try may learn an honourable way to its rewards, cannot be deemed the mo&s;t favourable &s;oil for the growth of tho&s;e &s;en&s;ibilities which, though not virtues them&s;elves, are at lea&s;t Virtue's faithful allies.</P>
<P>Sir James was the fir&s;t, therefore, to call the at|tention of his &s;i&s;ter-in-law from the tomb which held her affections, to tho&s;e duties which &s;he owed to &s;ociety, to her children, to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"I am a lone man," &s;aid the knight, "and, by the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven upon hone&s;t endeavours, have accumulated more than I &s;hall ever &s;pend. My brother, I know, accumulated in another way&mdash;his &s;tock was the trea&s;ure of the mind&mdash;a proper po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, doubtle&s;s, for a clergyman, but for which his heirs are little or no|thing the better.</P>
<P>"After the lo&s;s you have &s;u&s;tained, my &s;i&s;ter," continued the night, "I am &s;ure your inclination is to quit this place as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. I in&s;i&s;t on a vi&s;it to my old man&s;ion, where we may lei&s;urely di&s;cu&s;s the plan I have in contemplation to make us all happy."</P>
<P>A propo&s;al &s;o perfectly congenial to her wi&s;hes was readily accepted by Mrs. Barnwell, and a day was named for their departure; but whil&s;t her&s;elf and Eliza impatiently de&s;ired that day's arrival, George deprecated its approach. To quit for ever his na|tive home&mdash;co&s;t his young heart&mdash;which was the
<PB N="11" REF="038596_0010_10129E2227E71298">
&s;hrine of &s;en&s;ibility&mdash;&s;ome &s;truggles. Among the various objects that called reflection to its plea&s;ing painful ta&s;k, there &s;tood in the centre of the garden a &s;mall temple, built in the Gothic &s;tyle, and dedica|ted to retirement. This was con&s;tructed under the direction of George him&s;elf, and was the favourite retreat of the rector. To this place young Barn|well would frequently retire, where memory would rehear&s;e to him tho&s;e le&s;&s;ons, to which he had often li&s;tened with reverent attention&mdash;and, aided by fan|cy, would place his father's countenance and form before him.&mdash;As he &s;trolled round the grounds, in one place a plant, in another &s;ome little monument with cla&s;&s;ical quotation, would remind him of the plea&s;ing-employment of his pa&s;t hours.</P>

<P>One of the ai&s;les of the chapel &s;till remained in its original &s;tate, and afforded conver&s;ation matter for all the lovers of romance in the country, Spec|tres of all &s;izes and &s;hapes, of either &s;ex, had been &s;een, by moonlight or torchlight, at different times, playing mo&s;t &s;ingular antics in the old abbey chapel.

<P>Among other &s;ubjects which-engro&s;&s;ed the atten|tion of the company at the knight's table, a few days after his return from the rectory, the haunted ai&s;le became a topic of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>"Well, I don't know," &s;aid Sir James; "&s;uch things may be&mdash;&s;pirits may walk. For my own part, I would neither ob&s;tinately deny all belief in &s;tories of this kind, nor would I implicitly believe all I hear. What thinks my nephew George; he &s;miles as if he would convey a &s;ort of contempt for things of this nature."</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="038596_0012_10129E26EB371858">
George blu&s;hed deeply. He had not been accu&s;|tomed to &s;peak in &s;o large, and re&s;pectable a com|pany as the knight's ho&s;pitality had a&s;&s;embled, and felt con&s;iderable embarra&s;&s;ment in &s;o new a &s;itua|tion. He recovered him&s;elf, and, with &s;ome he&s;ita|tion, &s;aid, "I confe&s;s, Sir, I have been taught to con&s;ider &s;tories of this de&s;cription as ridiculous."</P>
<P>"Ridiculous!" exclaimed Mr. Sandall the chap|lain&mdash;"ridiculous! young gentleman; and where|fore, let me a&s;k, ridiculous?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e, being irreconcileable to truth and na|ture, they are beneath the dignity of &s;erious argu|ment."</P>
<P>"It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, Mr. Sandall," &s;aid the knight, "that the&s;e appearances are &s;upernatural."</P>
<P>"Allow me, to remark, Sir James," ob&s;equiou&s;ly &s;aid Mr. Sandall, "that is no proof of their non-ex|i&s;tence; be&s;ides, with all deference, I would a&s;k how we, who&s;e ideas are &s;o finite, can pretend to limit the operations of the Author of nature."</P>
<P>And then rai&s;ing his voice triumphantly, and fix|ing his &s;mall &s;harp eyes on Barnwell&mdash;"I believe, young gentleman," interrupted he, "if you had &s;een the appearances the&s;e eyes have witne&s;&s;ed, at the abbey, your courage would have fled with your incre|dulity."</P>
<P>George only bowed.</P>
<P>A Mi&s;s Lucas, a neighbouring maiden lady of fortune, could not &s;uffer &s;o charming a &s;ubject as gho&s;ts to be dropped &s;o ea&s;ily.</P>
<P>"Surely, Sir," &s;aid this lady to Barnwell, "you cannot pre&s;ume to put your opinion in competition with &s;uch high authorities as Drelincourt on Death, and Dr. John&s;on. You will allow, I hope, there are gho&s;ts, though it may not have been your privilege to have &s;een them."</P>
<P>"Without incurring the charge of vanity, I appre|hend," &s;aid Barnwell, "that I may hold an opinion even again&s;t the greate&s;t authorities: for you will allow, that judgment &s;hould yield to argument, not names.
<PB N="14" REF="038596_0013_10129E29D7D8DBC0">
I have never beheld a &s;pectre my&s;elf, and I am in|clined to attribute the narratives of tho&s;e, who &s;ay they have, to the influence of a weak or a warm imagination acted upon by accidental circum&s;tances."</P>
<P>"It's rather &s;ingular, then," &s;aid Mr. Sandall, "that the greater part of mankind &s;hould have re|mained &s;o long in error: for I conceive a majority believe in apparitions."</P>
<P>"There cannot be a doubt of that, Mr. Sandall," &s;aid Mi&s;s Lucas. "This is termed an enlightened age; and pray, does not the popular opinion &s;anction, almo&s;t exclu&s;ively, a novel, a romance, or a drama, where the prominent character is a gho&s;t, or a daemon?"</P>
<P>"And yet," replied Barnwell, "I cannot bring my&s;elf to con&s;ider even this univer&s;al patronage as the con&s;equence of a general belief in &s;pectres; unle&s;s it could be fir&s;t proved, that the ma&s;s of man|kind are mo&s;t delighted with known truths: whereas I con&s;ider the chief &s;ource of the plea&s;ure in read|ing or &s;eeing &s;uch unnatural productions, is, their remote di&s;tance from probability; which, creating a <HI>mon&s;trous novelty,</HI> excites the attention of tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;ole aim is amu&s;ement."</P>
<P>"Pray, Sir," &s;aid Mi&s;s Lucas, "have you among other things been taught a knowledge of the holy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">criptures?"</P>
<P>"My father, Madam, was a clergyman," &s;aid George, with a degree of warmth; "and I was in|tended for the &s;ame holy office;" added he, with an emphatic &s;igh.</P>
<P>"Then, pray," &s;aid Mi&s;s Lucas, without feeling the rebuke, "do you believe the &s;tory of the Witch of Endor?"</P>
<P>"Pardon me," interrupted Sir James; "but it is a cu&s;tom I have e&s;tabli&s;hed at my own table, the&s;e thirty years, never to permit the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of reli|gious or political &s;ubjects over the bottle. I beg leave, therefore, to propo&s;e a walk."</P>

<P>WHY is curio&s;ity mo&s;t ea&s;ily rai&s;ed, or why mo&s;t unquietly does it re&s;t, in the female brea&s;t?</P>
<P>Eliza, who&s;e mode&s;ty did not permit her to trou|ble the company with her ob&s;ervations, yet trea&s;ur|ed in her memory all that had been &s;aid concerning the abbey.</P>
<P>When &s;he retired to her chamber, the windows of which commanded a view of the ruins, &s;he que&s;|tioned the &s;ervant who attended her concerning the &s;tory of the haunted ai&s;le. The incongruous nar|rative of Hannah &s;erved only to increa&s;e her curio&s;ity, and &s;he determined to pay a vi&s;it to the abbey the following morning before breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Sleep did not conquer the &s;en&s;es of Eliza, that evening, with its u&s;ual ea&s;e. She had extingui&s;hed her candle, had whi&s;pered a prayer from the heart, and &s;ought repo&s;e. A &s;light &s;lumber brought with it the following dream&mdash;</P>
<P>"She had reached the abbey ruins, and was ju&s;t entering the haunted ai&s;le, when a tomb which &s;tood at the entrance &s;eemed to rock at her approach. Whil&s;t he&s;itating whether to retire or advance, the tomb became enveloped in an a&s;cending vapour. In a moment the abbey ruins echoed the groans of one in the agonies of death; and as the vapour di&s;per&s;ed, there appeared kneeling on the tomb a mo&s;t beautiful female, naked to the wai&s;t. Her eyes were &s;wollen with weeping, her hair was di&s;hevelled, and from her wounded brea&s;t blood trickled, whil&s;t her hands in vain attempted to remove a dagger, who&s;e fatal point was buried in her bo&s;om. Eliza's attention
<PB N="16" REF="038596_0015_10129E2F85B82068">
to the &s;pectre was &s;o inten&s;e, that &s;he did not notice the form of a man who &s;tood contemplating with &s;miles the agonies of the female, until the &s;ound of a harp, which he touched in a rapid manner, arou&s;|ed her. His figure was hand&s;ome, his complexion a dark brown, and jet-black hair curled in ringlets on his forehead: his voice, which accompanied the harp, was melodious. Li&s;tening to his lively &s;train, Eliza was &s;mote with horror and a&s;toni&s;hment at the following rhap&s;ody.&mdash;</P>
<LG>
<L>Flow &s;oftly&mdash;gently&mdash;vital &s;tream;</L>

<L>Ri&s;e&mdash;ri&s;e&mdash;infernal &s;pirits ri&s;e,</L>
<L>Swift dart acro&s;s her brain:</L>
<L>Thou, Horror, with blood-chilling cries,</L>

<L>O, fea&s;t my &s;oul&mdash;revenge is &s;weet:</L>
<L>Loui&s;a, take my &s;corn;&mdash;</L>
<L>Curs'd was the hour that &s;aw us meet,</L>
<L>The hour when we were born!</L>
</LG>
<P>Scarcely was the la&s;t &s;tanza &s;ung, when the tremb|ling Eliza awoke from her dream; doubting for a con&s;iderable time, whether what &s;he had &s;een or heard was not reality. Ju&s;t as &s;he had overcome the impre&s;&s;ions ari&s;ing from &s;o horrible a vi&s;ion, the night wind wafted by the ca&s;ement of her chamber the tone of an in&s;trument &s;o &s;imilar to tho&s;e &s;he had heard in fancy, that, &s;tarting up in her bed, &s;he drew a&s;ide the curtain, under an apprehen&s;ion of be|holding, awake, the vi&s;ion of her &s;leep.</P>
<P>The chamber was in total darkne&s;s; but the &s;ame &s;ounds were repeated; and hearing them now more di&s;tinctly, her heart &s;unk with terror at the certain|ty. She determined to quit her bed, and feeling her way to the window, opened it. The &s;ame &s;ounds
<PB N="17" REF="038596_0016_10129E32A4D96150">
were heard again, yet more di&s;tinctly, and &s;he was convinced they came from the abbey ruins. She bent her eyes towards the &s;pot whence they i&s;&s;ued: in a few moments all was &s;ilence, and &s;he beheld a lighted torch borne along the ruins, but the night was too dark to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the per&s;on that carried it.</P>
<P>Returning to her bed, terrified and a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;he began to rea&s;on with her fears. That the mu|&s;ic was not imaginary &s;he was convinced; and that its influence, added to the impre&s;&s;ion of Hannah's incoherent narrative, which bore a re&s;emblance to her dream, had occa&s;ioned the vi&s;ion, &s;he no longer doubted: yet not le&s;s &s;trange appeared the reality than the vi&s;ion. For what purpo&s;e any one could ramble among the mouldering tombs of the abbey, &s;he had yet to learn. Fear, at length, gradually re|tired from her brea&s;t; but its mo&s;t con&s;tant com|panion Curio&s;ity remained.</P>

<P>"THERE is a very &s;ingular coincidence of your dream with the mu&s;ic you really heard," &s;aid George to his &s;i&s;ter, who had unburdened her mind to him, according to her u&s;ual practice. "Do you remember enough of the place you &s;uppo&s;ed was the abbey, to compare what you &s;aw in your dream with the ruins them&s;elves?"</P>
<P>"Beyond a doubt," &s;aid Eliza.</P>
<P>"We will take a ramble there in the evening," replied George; "and &s;hould there be a tomb in the
<PB N="18" REF="038596_0017_10129E35824B3C08">
old ai&s;le re&s;embling that in your dream, I think we &s;hould relate the whole to Sir James. Murder," added he, "is a crime, above all others, offen&s;ive to the Deity; and if ever the omnipotent, di&s;plays a miracle, I can conceive nothing more likely to oc|ca&s;ion his &s;upernatural interference than detection of &s;o foul a crime."</P>
<P>They &s;eparated. At dinner they joined a numer|ous circle of the neighbouring gentry. It was the cu&s;tom of Sir James, once a year, to invite them all without exception. At other times he indulged his plea&s;ure in a &s;election. On this occa&s;ion he re|linqui&s;hed his prejudices, and though him&s;elf a whig of the old &s;chool, and a high church-man, there were at his table individuals of as various a ca&s;t, as a circuit of ten miles round contained.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e vi&s;itors, there was one mo&s;t oppo|&s;ite to the worthy knight in his principles and his manners, and who&s;e re&s;idence was contiguous to Sir James's.</P>
<P>By the oppo&s;ite to a whig, u&s;ed to be formerly un|der&s;tood a tory; and by the oppo&s;ite to high-church, low-church was &s;ugge&s;ted. Now Mr. Mental was neither whig nor tory, nor a high, nor low church|man; yet were his principles more at variance with Sir James than a Jacobite pre&s;byter's: the latter on|ly diffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed with the knight as to the per&s;on of a king and the modes of religion. Mr. Mental was &s;uppo&s;ed to be equally aver&s;e to all kings, and to all religion.</P>
<P>As his figure and dre&s;s were the mo&s;t &s;ingular imaginable, they rendered him con&s;picuous in all companies. He was of a large make, but thin; his face pale; his hair, a coal black, cropped &s;hort in the neck; his dre&s;s, always the &s;ame, a &s;uit of plain brown cloth. He would eat nothing that had ever enjoyed life; nothing in which &s;ugar was an ingredient; and his drink was water. He never &s;miled; and the only plea&s;ure he ever appeared to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">njoy, was the triumph of argument. To obtain this
<PB N="19" REF="038596_0018_10129E399E6EB5E0">
this plea&s;ure, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould con&s;tantly controvert the mo&s;t allowed truths; delighted in attacking revela|tion, and was indefatigable in di&s;covering the &s;cru|ples of his hearers on religious points</P>
<P>The irremediable evils of &s;ociety were his deare&s;t topics, and the climax of his felicity was, by the abu&s;e of the eloquence he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to render di&s;content triumphant.</P>
<P>He had re&s;ided in the neighbourhood many years, but &s;aw no company at his own hou&s;e, and very rarely accepted an invitation to any other: when|ever he did, it was his invariable cu&s;tom to &s;ingle out one from the younger part of a company, with whom he would abruptly begin a conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>George and a young baronet, of one and twenty, were engaged in &s;ome trifling di&s;cour&s;e, when Mr. Mental tapped the latter on the &s;houlder, and a&s;ked him if he had read a celebrated novel, much talked of.</P>
<P>"I never read novels" &s;aid the baronet.</P>
<P>"Why not?" a&s;ked Mr. Mental.</P>
<P>"It is throwing away one's time, to &s;ay the be&s;t," replied the baronet. "I make a point never to read any thing of <HI>that</HI> &s;ort. I never read a novel in my life, and I never will: they're well enough for girls."</P>
<P>"Prejudice&mdash;Prejudice&mdash;Prejudice&mdash;how art thou wor&s;hipped in this i&s;le!" exclaimed Mr. Men|tal. "I &s;uppo&s;e, then, you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a pretty good depth in literature of a more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or erudite nature," continued he. "Have you looked into the Political Ju&s;tice?"</P>
<P>"I make a point never to read works of <HI>that</HI> de|&s;cription; I under&s;tand its object is to turn every thing top&s;y-turvy; and I feel no &s;ort of inclination to be made giddy. I leave this &s;ort of thing to your revolutioni&s;ts."</P>
<P>"Prejudice again," cried Mental.&mdash;"Perhaps then, you dive into the mines of &s;cience. You read&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Oh, no, believe me, not I. I was obliged to
<PB N="20" REF="038596_0019_10129E3B305AB150">
do &s;omething in that way at Pembroke. But I've don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> with lectures compleatly; and, to own the truth, the only &s;cience I care about now, is, to make an e&s;tate of ten thou&s;and a year bring me happine&s;s in the way I like it."</P>
<P>"I crave your pardon then," &s;aid Mr. Mental. "Had I known you were in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ten thou&s;and a year, I &s;hould by no means have &s;u&s;pect|ed you guilty of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a mind."</P>
<P>"Is there no prejudice in that ob&s;ervation, Sir?" &s;aid Barnwell, with a &s;mile of mode&s;t diffidence.</P>
<P>Mr. Mental, in&s;tead of an&s;wering, fixed a pair of large black eyes on George; and, folding his arms upon his brea&s;t, examined every feature of his countenance. After a con&s;iderable pau&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>"You, I believe, do not po&s;&s;e&s;s ten thou&s;and a year," cried he; "but if I am not much, indeed, deceived, you have materials of which a &s;kilful arti&s;t might form a great mind. Allow me to a&s;k you&mdash;have you a father?"</P>
<P>George gave an expre&s;&s;ive look.</P>
<P>"He has left you&mdash;Did I know him&mdash;was he of the&s;e parts?"</P>
<P>George &s;atisfied his curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>"Unfortunate!&mdash;unfortunate, indeed! contin|ued Mental, "that &s;uch materials &s;hould have fallen into &s;uch hands. You of cour&s;e endeavour to compel your rea&s;on to adopt all tho&s;e doctrines which prie&s;tcraf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">aches."</P>
<P>"Sir," replied Barnwell, with the glow of indig|nation on his cheeks, "the honoured per&s;on to whom, without knowing him, you apply a com|mon-place epithet, never &s;trove to in&s;pire a &s;enti|ment in the brea&s;t of his children, to which the mo&s;t enlightened rea&s;on could object."</P>
<P>"You rejoice me," cried Mental&mdash;"You have not then imbibed the jargon of &s;uper&s;tition, called religion."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some readers may deem it an impertinent interruption, if not an impeachment of their under&s;tandings, to be reminded "that the &s;entiments which are put into the mouths of various per&s;onages in a novel, are for the illu&s;tration of their various characters, and ought never to be viewed in any other light." But the author would rather incur the blame of an unnece&s;&s;ary interruption, than &s;uffer the <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of a &s;uppo&s;ition that it was his wi&s;h to <HI>di&s;&s;eminate</HI> principles, which it is his aim to <HI>de&s;troy.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="038596_0020_10129E3E21ED3610">
"Super&s;tition and religion in your dictionary then, are &s;ynonymous terms," cried Barnwell.</P>
<P>"In the dictionary of truth they are &s;o," replied Mental. "What is religion&mdash;but ceremony, or a &s;et of ceremonies:&mdash;what are ceremonies, but &s;uper|&s;tition! For in&s;tance; how ab&s;urd, how degrading to a human being, with faculties &s;o comprehen&s;ive that all nature bows before him, to which &s;he unfolds her &s;ecrets and &s;ubmits her laws&mdash;I &s;ay then it mu&s;t be beneath the dignity of &s;uch a creature to bend his knees, to bow his head, and mumble &s;yllables of ab|&s;urdities &s;trung together centuries ago, when, by the exerci&s;e of his own powers, he might be introduced into the arcana of great Nature her&s;elf."</P>
<P>George replied&mdash;"The dignity of human na|ture, Sir, is no new &s;ubject to me. My father taught it me truly, and exemplified his doctrines by his conduct. He taught me, Sir, that the dignity of our nature cannot be degraded by a public ac|knowledgement of our obligations to the Author of nature, according to the cu&s;toms and manners of our country; and that it is better to &s;anction, by exam|ple, even prejudices, which cannot be momentarily and &s;afely removed, than by ridiculing tho&s;e in&s;titu|tions, which the ma&s;s of our fellow citizens hold &s;a|cred, to give the reins to uncultivated nature."</P>
<P>"There is a vein of independence in your rea|&s;oning I admire extremely, however much we may deviate in our conclu&s;ions," &s;aid Mental.</P>
<P>This introduction led to a long conver&s;ation, in which each &s;eemed to take an intere&s;t. Mental appeared le&s;s and le&s;s di&s;gu&s;ting in the eyes of George, and George delighted old Mental, who expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h that this would not be the la&s;t of their conver&s;ations.&mdash;</P>

<P>A SUMMER day drew towards its clo&s;e&mdash;car|riage after carriage had rolled away the well-plea&s;ed gue&s;ts of the worthy knight; and &s;ilence once more reigned in the temple of ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="038596_0022_10129E4555FB55A8">
While Eliza, with a palpitating heart, accompani|ed her brother to the haunted ai&s;le, the impre&s;&s;ions of terror revived in her brea&s;t as&punc; they entered the avenue from the park, which led directly to the ruins.&mdash;They were at the entrance of the ai&s;le&mdash;Eliza trembled&mdash;</P>
<P>"Stay," &s;aid George; "it is dark, and we are far from the hou&s;e. A thought &s;trikes me&mdash;I have little dread of gho&s;ts&mdash;but it is not impo&s;&s;ible that this retreat may be the rendezvous of beings le&s;s merciful, and more powerful, than mere &s;pectres. Were we to be attacked, our loude&s;t cries would reach no friendly ear.&mdash;Do you wait a moment behind this old column, and li&s;ten attentively. I will go on. Should there be danger, you will hear my cries (they &s;hall be loud enough) and immediately run as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible towards the hou&s;e&mdash;it's a &s;traight road, and you cannot mi&s;s it."</P>
<P>When George had re&s;olved on any purpo&s;e, he always adhered to it. Remon&s;trance on the &s;core of his per&s;onal danger was in vain, and the anxious Eliza clung round the pillar in trembling expecta|tion. A few minutes ela&s;ped&mdash;Eliza grew impa|tient. A few minutes more pa&s;&s;ed away&mdash;no noi&s;e was heard&mdash;no brother returned. The whole &s;pace of time was le&s;s than ten minutes&mdash;but how much longe it appeared in the reckoning of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, is ea&s;ily conceived.</P>
<P>At length &s;he heard a di&s;tant &s;ound of foot&s;teps;&mdash;it approached nearer&mdash;&s;he left her retreat, think|ing to meet her brother; when a form, muffled in a long black cloak, and ma&s;ked, met her at the entrance of the ai&s;le. She &s;creamed&mdash;In an in&s;tant George was at her elbow; but the cau&s;e of her alarm was vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>"Surely I cannot be deceived?" &s;aid George. "'Twas certainly a man&mdash;I &s;aw him mo&s;t di&s;tinctly. A black cloak and a ma&s;k were lying on the very tomb you have de&s;cribed. As I approached it, a man, who was kneeling near it, &s;tarted up, hurried

on the cloak and ma&s;k, and, pre&s;ented a pi&s;tol, &s;poke the&s;e remarkable words&mdash;'I am di&s;covered!' Ere I had recovered from my &s;urpri&s;e he vani&s;hed."</P>
<P>"For heaven's &s;ake, my dear brother, let us quit this &s;ituation: it may be the abode of murderers," &s;aid Eliza.</P>
<P>They walked &s;wiftly towards the hou&s;e&mdash;"There are &s;o many &s;ingular circum&s;tances combined in this adventure," &s;aid George, "that I am determined to relate the whole affair to Sir James."</P>
<P>It was late when they reached home; the family were a&s;&s;embled at &s;upper, and the looks of Eliza an|&s;wered the purpo&s;e of a preface to George's narra|tive.</P>
<P>"Now, young gentleman," &s;aid Mr. Sandall, triumphantly, "I &s;uppo&s;e you concede a little of your &s;ceptici&s;m again&s;t apparitions.</P>
<P>"Not a &s;cruple," &s;aid George.</P>
<P>"What! will you allow nothing &s;upernatural in the dream of Mi&s;s Barnwell&mdash;nothing &s;upernatural in the de&s;cription &s;he gives of the tomb &s;he never beheld?"</P>
<P>"True" &s;aid George, "&s;he never beheld this tomb; but Hannah has &s;een it, and in de&s;cribing it to my &s;i&s;ter, &s;o impre&s;&s;ed the image on her mind, that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> impo&s;&s;ible to doubt the origin of her dream."</P>
<P>"Did Hannah, too, impre&s;s her mind with the poem &s;he &s;o well remembered?"</P>
<P>"Hannah told me a confu&s;ed &s;tory, &s;omething &s;imilar in its circum&s;tances to tho&s;e in my dream," &s;aid Eliza.</P>
<P>"I have heard," &s;aid Sir James, "&s;tories of this nature frequently repeated; but, till now, I own, I never paid a &s;erious attention to them. What has happened, however, determines me to take &s;ome ac|tive mea&s;ures towards unravelling the apparent my&s;|tery. In the morning I will my&s;elf &s;ee the place, and examine its appearances."</P>
<P>In the morning the knight, with a numerous train of attendants, &s;allied forth to &s;urvey the haunted
<PB N="52" REF="038596_0024_10129E4A077FA5B0">
ai&s;le. He was &s;upported on his right hand by the &s;uper&s;titious Mr. Sandall; on his left by Barnwell. A few armed dome&s;tics preceded them&mdash;Arrived at the entrance of the ai&s;le, Mr. Sandall pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>"If I might advi&s;e," &s;aid he, "the &s;ervants, I conceive &s;hould fir&s;t &s;earch the place, for they are armed."</P>
<P>"But what are arms again&s;t incorporeal &s;ub&s;tan|ces, Mr. Sandall?" &s;aid George. "Be&s;ides, we can take the arms which the &s;ervants carry, who may wait here, and be within call, if their a&s;&s;i&s;tance is wanted."</P>
<P>"Fooli&s;h &s;cheme enough!" &s;aid Sandall, terrified in no &s;mall degree.</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;e," continued George, "&s;ome daemon really tenants the old tomb, what do the &s;ervants know of exorci&s;ing? Come, Sir, let us enter. I'll take this mu&s;ket, and if the inhabitants are formed of tangible &s;tuff, a bullet may be u&s;eful, in ca&s;e of attack; on the other hand, &s;hould they be &s;piritual re&s;identiaries, I &s;hall turn them over to the di&s;cipline of the church."</P>
<P>"Not &s;o much levity," &s;aid Sir James. "I ap|prehend no danger; but there's no telling&mdash;&s;o go on, Jo&s;eph we'll proceed&mdash;as we &s;et out."</P>
<P>Some minutes pa&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence. Nothing was heard, nothing was &s;een, that could ju&s;tify the mo&s;t di&s;tant conjecture. George could hardly refrain &s;miling, and in his heart exclaimed&mdash;<HI>"I would this &s;olemn mockery were ended;"</HI> but his uncle's reproof was yet recent. At length&mdash;</P>
<P>"Are you &s;ure you &s;aw upon this tomb&mdash;this very tomb, a ma&s;k and a cloak?" &s;aid Sir James: "that you al&s;o &s;aw a man kneel near this tomb&mdash;&s;aw him ri&s;e&mdash;put on the ma&s;k and cloak&mdash;Are you perfectly convinced no part of this was imagina|tion?"</P>
<P>"I am &s;ure I &s;aw all that you have &s;tated."</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="038596_0025_10129E4D39051F48">
"'Tis very &s;trange!" &s;aid Sir James.</P>
<P>"Very &s;trange!" &s;aid every one.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Could not this tomb be moved?" &s;aid George. "Where we in the fore&s;ts of Germany, I &s;hould be induced to think, from circum&s;tances, that it co|vers the trap door of &s;ome &s;ubterraneous cavern."</P>
<P>"Aye, Sir," &s;aid Jo&s;eph, an old dome&s;tic of the knight's, "you have hit the right nail on its head now. To be &s;ure its no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine; but if I were a magi&s;trate&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Hold your tongue, Jo&s;eph&mdash;What would you do, if you were a magi&s;trate?" &s;aid the knight in a breath.</P>
<P>"Why, might I be bold to &s;peak the truth, I do think murder lies hid under this here <HI>moniment;</HI> and if I was a magi&s;trate, it &s;hould be all pulled down, and dug under; and my life on it, but murder lies at the bottom."</P>
<P>"That can't be done without the con&s;ent of the owner," &s;aid Sir James, "or &s;ome better grounds of &s;u&s;picion than we have at pre&s;ent."</P>
<P>"Do you not own the ruins, Sir?" &s;aid George.</P>
<P>"Not this part of them," &s;aid the knight. "All the land on this &s;ide the row of alder trees belongs to the next e&s;tate."</P>
<P>"And who owns that?" a&s;ked George.</P>
<P>"Mr. Mental, the cynic you &s;aw ye&s;terday. What do you &s;tart at?"</P>
<P>"Nothing, Sir," replied George, he&s;itating;&mdash;"but&mdash;Mr. Mental&mdash;is&mdash;a &s;trange man."</P>
<P>"Ah, God forgive him, if all they &s;ay be true," cried old Jo&s;eph, with an expre&s;&s;ive &s;hake of the head.</P>
<P>"God can't forgive him," cried Sandall: "he's an athei&s;t."</P>
<P>"He is a &s;ingular man, undoubtedly," &s;aid Sir James;" "and people will talk. Nobody, it &s;eems knows who or what he is, or where he came from&punc; But I have heard old men, who remember his fir&s;t coming here, whi&s;per &s;trange &s;tories."</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="038596_0026_10129E5151B46CC8">
George was ruminating&mdash;After another fruitle&s;s &s;earch they returned home.</P>
<P>A variety of conjectures pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the fertile imagination of George, all pointed to Mr. Mental. He now conceived, that the man he had &s;een the preceding evening was Mr. Mental. He imagined the voice he had heard re&s;embled Mr. Mental's, and built upon the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions a &s;u&s;picion to the di&s;advantage of his character. Quickly again his heart rebuked him for &s;o illiberal a conclu&s;ion from a train of mere accidents. He recollected his invitation, and re&s;olved immediately to vi&s;it him. Unwilling to awake tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions in the brea&s;t of another, which he was him&s;elf a&s;hamed of cheri&s;h|ing, he determined to keep his vi&s;it a &s;ecret from the family; and merely ob&s;erved, that as he wi&s;hed to take a long &s;troll, it was doubtful if he &s;hould return before evening.</P>

<P>THE re&s;idence of Mr. Mental was a &s;hort di&s;|tance from Sir James's. It was a large old-fa&s;hion|ed hou&s;e, containing many rooms: of the&s;e only three were in u&s;e; one &s;erved as a kitchen, and chamber for an old woman, his only dome&s;tic; a &s;econd was a &s;itting, eating, and &s;leeping room of her ma&s;ter; and the third was a &s;tudy.</P>
<P>George rung a bell at the iron gate, which open|ed on a plot of ground before the hou&s;e, that was formerly a lawn. In its pre&s;ent neglected &s;tate it
<PB N="28" REF="038596_0027_10129E52E2C71B50">
would be difficult to call it by any name that would convey an idea of its appearance.</P>
<P>The above named old dame appeared at a window, and demanded the bu&s;ine&s;s of Barnwell. Having informed her ma&s;ter, George was admitted. Wad|ing through 'weeds mo&s;t rank and wile,' he had at length found him&s;elf in the afore&s;aid &s;itting room, where Sarah told him her ma&s;ter would come to him.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time mo&s;t patiently occupied in con|templating the motly furniture of the apartment, and a few ejaculations of &s;urpri&s;e at &s;o &s;trange a mode of life, George ventured to call old Sarah, and a&s;k if her ma&s;ter was particularly engaged; if &s;o, he would take another opportunity of &s;eeing him.</P>
<P>"As to that, come when you will, he's always at his &s;tudies," &s;aid Sarah.</P>
<P>"Shall I go to him?" &s;aid George.</P>
<P>"God forbid!" exclaimed Sarah&mdash;"Go into the &s;tudy!&mdash;I have been here the&s;e twenty years, and no living &s;oul but ma&s;ter has been in that &s;tudy."</P>
<P>Every moment the curio&s;ity of George was in|crea&s;ed, and he felt a great inclination to chat with Sarah concerning her ma&s;ter, when the original him&s;elf appeared. George gazed earne&s;tly at him as he entered, but could ob&s;erve nothing in his coun|tenance that in the lea&s;t &s;anctioned his &s;u&s;picions: there was no embarra&s;&s;ment, but an air of &s;olemn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e, a kind of look that indicated a familiarity with grief.</P>
<P>"And you are really come," exclaimed he. "Is it the &s;pur of curio&s;ity that has urged you to this com|pliance? Come, be hone&s;t, Sir. You wondered, doubtle&s;s, how an old fellow, like my&s;elf, could at fir&s;t &s;ight be &s;mitten with an attachment to your countenance. Sir, I have read the wondrous vol|ume of this world&mdash;I have been among&s;t men&mdash;I have bu&s;tled in the crowd. I have al&s;o been &s;eclu|ded from the herd; and in &s;ilent mu&s;ings of full ma|ny

Often by the countenance men are deceived. I may be &s;o. If I am not, you have an hone&s;t mind; by which I mean, that you are &s;incere; that your tongue utters what your heart prompts, and your rea&s;on dictates. Now tell me, Sir, what kind of man you think me."</P>
<P>"Forming my judgment &s;olely on appearances, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e you a di&s;appointed man; one whom misfortunes have induced to quarrel with the world."</P>
<P>"The very notions I &s;hould have entertained, had I &s;een my pre&s;ent re&s;emblance at your age: for then I viewed mankind through the &s;ame fairy tele&s;cope that you do now. Then my delighted fancy &s;aw &s;uch gue&s;ts on earth, as Sympathy, Friend&s;hip, and Love; my heart hailed them for its own; it panted for inmates &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to its health and peace, and like you, I &s;hould have thought that man unfortunate who mi&s;&s;ed the bli&s;s around him.

There is no &s;ympathy; no friend&s;hip, no love among&s;t the apo&s;tate race of man. Do I not know it&mdash;have I not felt it!&mdash;"</P>
<P>The ge&s;ture that accompanied this apo&s;trophe was that of the extreme&s;t angui&s;h. George was af|fected, and Mental &s;aw the emotion he had ex|cited.</P>
<P>"Nay, nay," &s;aid he, "I mean not to in&s;inuate, that I am peculiarly wretched&mdash;'Tis the common lot&mdash;the de&s;tiny of man&mdash;to be deceived, to hope and

You have received, I think, a liberal education."</P>
<P>George here expatiated on the benefits he had received from the tuition of his father in mo&s;t live|ly colours.</P>
<P>"Your father mu&s;t have been a man of erudi|tion; and not only &s;o, but a man of ta&s;te and feel|ing. Do you imagine he would have approved of your entering into commercial concerns?"</P>
<P>"His intentions were very oppo&s;ite."</P>
<P>"And I believe your inclinations are the &s;ame."</P>
<P>"I cannot conceal the truth; they certainly are."</P>
<P>"Are you aware of the con&s;equences of entering upon a plan of life, where your duties and intere&s;ts will excite a perpetual rebellion of intellect, and in which it is impo&s;&s;ible to unite the cultivation of tho&s;e mental powers you po&s;&s;e&s;s, with a re&s;pectable progre&s;s in bu&s;ine&s;s?"</P>
<P>"I have thought on this;&mdash;again and again have thought on it&mdash;but what can I do? The will of my benefactor, of my mother, o'erpoi&s;es all other con|&s;iderations. To refu&s;e the bounty of the former, would offend him, and render mi&s;erable a mo&s;t ex|cellent mother. I mu&s;t therefore entreat your for|bearance on this &s;ubject, however much I am ob|liged by your generous intentions."</P>
<P>"Nay, I will not forbear. Would you &s;ee a pa&s;|&s;enger approach a lion's den, from which you had e&s;caped, and think it unpolite to interrupt him?

<P>"THE father of the man you &s;ee before you," &s;aid Mental, was a trade&s;man. He was unfor|tunate in the concerns he undertook, &s;omewhat neg|ligent in con&s;equence of misfortunes, and, at la&s;t, broken-hearted with di&s;appointment, &s;unk poor to the grave.</P>
<P>"My mother had gone there long before, when I was little more than five years old. My parents had brought up &s;everal of their children to the pe|riod of youth; but at the demi&s;e of my father I was their only offspring living.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="038596_0031_10129E5E5CDE07A8">
"It may be well to remark to you a few traits of my earlie&s;t years, as peradventure you may &s;ome|where trace a re&s;emblance. I remember perfectly well, that, when only four years old, it was frequent|ly my amu&s;ement to mount upon a chair, arrayed in my mother's white apron, and a&s;&s;embling round me my younger brothers, an old woman their nur&s;e, and my mother, to preach with con&s;iderable vehe|mence.</P>
<P>"The prediction concerning me at that period, elevated my future fate to a mitre. After my mo|ther's decea&s;e, I went three or four times with a relation to the theatres, and I &s;till recollect the won|derful impul&s;e I felt to leap upon the &s;tage, and join the performers.</P>
<P>"A &s;imilar &s;en&s;ation often &s;eized me at church, where I always wi&s;hed my&s;elf in the pulpit. I know now that this was ambition in embryo; and had my parents' &s;ituation in life placed an army within my early views, I doubt not I &s;hould have felt the &s;ame impul&s;e to have &s;eized the truncheon from a General, as I did to di&s;place the clergyman from his pulpit, or thru&s;t the performer from the &s;tage.</P>
<P>"At &s;even years old I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the gravity of a &s;age. The pa&s;times of other boys were my aver|&s;ion. Books of all de&s;criptions that came within my reach I read, but not with that delight that anima|ted me in &s;cribbling over every piece of paper I could procure, with what I called my &s;tudies. The ef|fu&s;ions were generally of a &s;imilar nature with the book I had la&s;t read; and of cour&s;e I was a theolo|gian, a dramati&s;t, a poet, and a noveli&s;t, in turn. Nothing, however, at this period was a greater treat to me, than to be permitted to remain at table after dinner, when the other children were &s;ent to play, that I might li&s;ten to the di&s;cour&s;e of my elders.</P>
<P>"My bodily frame was &s;uch as may be expected from an indulgent mode of bringing up in a city, and my own &s;edentary inclination&mdash;weak and delicate. This con&s;ideration induced my father, for &s;ome time,
<PB N="33" REF="038596_0032_10129E61766AADE8">
to object to placing me in a public &s;eminary, where a relation offered to provide for me. Poverty, how|ever, advancing rapidly towards his humble dwel|ling, and quickening its pace, after dome&s;tic oeco|nomy had quitted it with my mother, made him &s;oon accept the offer of his cou&s;in.</P>
<P>"I left my native roof ere I was eight years old, and became a member of the celebrated public &s;chool at Eton. This I e&s;teem the fir&s;t grand aera in my life. A public &s;eminary is a little republic, where the honours and advantages of the commu|nity lie open to all; and in no other &s;oil can the &s;eeds of ambition be &s;o well cultivated. Soon was the &s;park of emulation felt within my bo&s;om, infu|&s;ing energy and vigour into every action. The middling cla&s;&s;es beheld me, with envy, pa&s;s their ranks; and the highe&s;t wondered at my&punc; &s;wift ap|proach. Succe&s;s urged fre&s;h endeavours, and ere I had attained my thirteenth year, I was qualified for the univer&s;ity; where I already was, in fancy, &s;trug|gling for academical di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>"Ju&s;t before my fourteenth birth day, was the &s;econd grand aera in my life. My father died in|&s;olvent. A letter from his cou&s;in, my benefactor, acquainted me, that, in con&s;equence of &s;ome con|&s;iderable failures in his &s;peculations, his fortune was much le&s;&s;ened; and that he could not fulfil his in|tentions of &s;upporting me at the univer&s;ity; adding, that as I was now of an age to go into the world, he wi&s;hed me to think of &s;ome trade I &s;hould like.</P>
<P>"You, Mr. Barnwell, can conceive my feelings; I cannot de&s;cribe them. In the fir&s;t moments of my di&s;appointment, rage conquered rea&s;on, and I con&s;idered my benefactor wor&s;e than an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. 'My God!' exclaimed I, 'is he not a murderer? Has he not made me the parent of the fonde&s;t hopes, the brighte&s;t, deare&s;t expectations? Did he not, him|&s;elf beget the&s;e dreams of bli&s;s which I have che|ri&s;hed? and now, with a word, he murders every hope!'&mdash;<HI>Trade!</HI>&mdash;my &s;oul &s;ickened at the &s;ound.
<PB N="34" REF="038596_0033_10129E648F76C550">
<HI>Apprentice!</HI>&mdash;horror was in the word, and every hope of happine&s;s vani&s;hed from my &s;ight. In another moment different feelings agitated me. My warm, romantic fancy, could not at once relinqui&s;h the views it had fo&s;tered. Pride aided fancy; and I per&s;uaded my&s;elf, that were my genius but known, it would mo&s;t certainly be patronized. I re&s;olved to write to a celebrated nobleman, at that time a patron of literature. The &s;ame evening on which I received my cou&s;in's letter, I wrote one for this no|bleman, intending to &s;end it the following morning; but in the morning my mind was in a different frame.</P>
<P>"I re&s;olved to &s;ee my benefactor. He was an opulent trade&s;man, and re&s;ided in the metropolis. 'You have received my letter, Henry,' &s;aid he. 'I am &s;orry you &s;hould be di&s;appointed in your views, though I have not a doubt but you will do much bet|ter in trade, than by drudging all your life time over books. Have you any choice?'</P>
<P>"None that I can follow now, Sir. I have in|dulged a hope that my indu&s;try at college might po&s;&s;ibly have recommended me&mdash;'To be &s;ome great man's toad-eater,' interrupted he: 'Is that what you mean?&mdash;It could do nothing el&s;e for you. The church is ab&s;olutely be&s;et with hungry &s;uppli|ants. There's no arriving at the bar without a for|tune; and as to phy&s;ic, a man's talents will never re|commend him to a patient, if he keeps no carriage. I wi&s;h to be your friend, Henry; and I think I know how:&mdash;it mu&s;t be by placing you in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as, however di&s;agreeable it may appear on entering, will lead you to independence.'</P>
<P>"I began now &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect upon the truth of the&s;e ob&s;ervations. I recollected I was &s;peaking to the only friend I had on earth; and though my pride &s;uffered a &s;evere wound, my judg|ment was improved in my own e&s;timation.</P>
<P>"After a pau&s;e, I yielded my a&s;&s;ent to the truth of his ob&s;ervations, and expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h that I could write a fine hand, as it might po&s;&s;ibly be in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is pow|er

to procure me a genteel &s;ituation in &s;ome merch|ant's compting-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>"He &s;miled at my wi&s;h&mdash;'You are in the &s;ame error there,' &s;aid he. 'I believe no &s;et of men la|bour more, in general, than per&s;ons of that de&s;crip|tion;&mdash;and what is their reward?&mdash;a clean &s;hirt, and a &s;hining pair of &s;hoes; which is plea&s;ant enough for a young man in his teens. But think of the &s;ituation of &s;uch men, if they marry&mdash;if they live to old age! A mechanic, who earns fifteen &s;hillings a week, is a prince to them. I by no means controul you: if you think genteel mi&s;ery de&s;irable, you will be a merchant's clerk.</P>
<P>"I was humbled in my own &s;ight; my heart no longer throbbed in the expectations that had delight|ed it; I felt it &s;inking, and a pa&s;&s;ive acquie&s;cence in his &s;entiments was the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>"We parted, with a promi&s;e from him to &s;end me the addre&s;s of a grocer the next day, on whom I was to wait as my future ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>"My colleagues at &s;chool &s;aw an alteration in my countenance, and &s;oon di&s;covered my future de&s;tiny; which attracted the &s;corn of &s;ome, the pity of many.</P>
<P>"In&s;tead of &s;leeping that night, my mind was bu&s;ily employed in contra&s;ting the real with the fan|cied &s;ituation that was to &s;ucceed my &s;chool days. My thir&s;t for literature was never more to be indul|ged, but conquered. Ah! fatal delu&s;ion! I thought it might be conquered&mdash;But, hear me, Mr. Barn|well&mdash;and would to God all men might hear me&mdash;the thir&s;t of knowledge is occa&s;ioned, Sir, by an un|quenchable &s;park, and mu&s;t be gratified, or will con|&s;ume.

<P>"Let &s;uch a man re&s;i&s;t the natural impul&s;e he will feel to yield his inclinations to the well meant, but fatal, advice even of parents. Let no commands, no tears, no &s;upplications, even of mother, bias him.

I did &s;o; and mark my hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>"I waited on Mr. Nutting, the grocer. He re|ceived me in a little room at the back of his &s;hop, where Mrs. Nutting was &s;itting. They appeared plain, plodding &s;ort of folks, remarkably neat in their dre&s;s, and preci&s;e in their di&s;cour&s;e. After a variety of que&s;tions, Mr. Nutting inquired if I was &s;en&s;ible of the importance of an intere&s;t in the merits and &s;ufferings of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. I cannot de&s;|cribe the a&s;toni&s;hment this que&s;tion occa&s;ioned me. Mr. Nutting &s;aw my &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>'Well, well,' &s;aid he, 'I &s;ee you have not been brought up with a proper &s;en&s;e of your eternal wel|fare.

<P>"Every nece&s;&s;ary was provided for me at Mr. Darwall's expence, and I bade farewell, with a &s;igh, to my &s;chool and my &s;chool companions.</P>

"I pa&s;&s;ed my month of approbation.&mdash;Night af|ter night, as I laid my head upon the pillow, I med|itated upon my &s;ituation; and &s;trong was the &s;trug|gle betwixt what I e&s;teemed my duty and my in|clination.</P>
<P>"Often would the &s;well of independence elevate my mind to the contemplation of the mo&s;t im|practicable &s;cheme!&mdash;As often would a &s;en&s;e of gratitude to Mr. Darwall, as well as an implicit faith in his a&s;&s;urances that my pre&s;ent (almo&s;t in|tolerable) &s;ituation would lead to future ea&s;e and comfort, baffle the &s;ugge&s;tions of my romantic fancy.</P>

<P>"THE menial offices which my &s;ituation com|pelled me to perform, at fir&s;t were grating to my pride; but I &s;oon di&s;covered <HI>that</HI> to be a <HI>fal&s;e</HI> pride, and, by degrees, became its ma&s;ter. I could &s;tand behind the counter and chop &s;ugar without feeling the &s;hame of a mean action; but I was often rou|&s;ed from a reverie by my ma&s;ter, when I have been weighing out teas, and at the &s;ame time bu&s;ily employed in the regions of fancy.</P>

"When the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day was ended, my apartment was the kitchen, my companions a me|thodi&s;t old woman, who was the &s;ervant, and her friend a black cat. Here I might have regaled my&s;elf after the fatigue of the day with reading; but unfortunately, the old lady's library, con&s;i&s;ting of the Pilgrim's Progre&s;s, the Holy War, and a vol|ume or two of &s;ermons, was at that time little &s;uited to my ta&s;te. The pious di&s;cour&s;e of the old dame was &s;till le&s;s plea&s;ing; thus (too fatigued for bodily employment) &s;leep, or a meditation, were my only alternatives; and from the&s;e I was frequently rou&s;ed by the tabernacle hymns, to the tune of which the old woman mended her &s;tockings.</P>
<P>"On Sundays I con&s;tantly attended the meeting to which my ma&s;ter belonged, where I was com|pelled to hear doctrines, at which my blood chilled, and my heart grew faint.</P>
<P>"The gloom of Calvini&s;m, the di&s;appointment of my fir&s;t hopes, the conque&s;t of my pride, the dull and cheerle&s;s life I lead, in a &s;hort &s;pace of time &s;o cooled the former ardor of my mind, that, if it is too much to &s;ay, I was heart-broken; I was reduced to that &s;tate of mind, which &s;ees no brightening pro&s;|pects in futurity, and which, cea&s;ing to hope, &s;tudies and &s;truggles to endure.</P>
<P>"Such was the &s;tate of mind in which, with a trembling hand, I &s;igned the indentures that con|&s;igned me for &s;even years to the gloom of a cloi&s;ter, without its con&s;olations or tranquility.</P>
<P>"Mr. Nutting, previous to my being bound, had often hinted to me, that I was &s;low in bu&s;ine&s;s; and thinking of one thing, whil&s;t I was doing another; and having once caught me in the attitude of &s;tudy, leaning upon a broom, with which I was &s;weeping the &s;hop, he exclaimed&mdash;"Henry, this won't do; you &s;eem more fit for a philo&s;opher than a trade&s;|man."</P>
<P>"With this opinion, which was certainly a ju&s;t one, Mr. Nutting ought not to have taken me as his

apprentice. But Mr. Nutting was not a rich man; and Mr. Darwall had promi&s;ed him a premium of &s;ixty guineas.</P>
<P>"From what I have related, you will readily con|ceive that I made but poor progre&s;s in the art and my&s;tery of the Grocer's Company; and though cheer|fully and willingly obeying my ma&s;ter in all his commands, I yet failed to plea&s;e him: the natural con&s;equence of a want of that energy in my bu&s;i|ne&s;s, of which inclination mu&s;t be the parent.</P>
<P>"I was more fortunate with my mi&s;tre&s;s. She was of a mild temper, and humane di&s;po&s;ition, and was a &s;trict Calvini&s;t from &s;incere conviction. Su|perior to her hu&s;band in intellect, &s;he would fre|quently, when opportunity offered, enter on a con|ver&s;ation with me, and di&s;covered an amiable heart. She was mi&s;tre&s;s of all the controver&s;ies upon theo|logical topics&punc; and felt great delight in confuting the arguments of the opponents of Calvin.</P>
<P>"When you recollect, Sir, that Mrs. Nutting's was the only conver&s;ation I enjoyed, which embrac|ed in any degree mental topics, you will not be &s;ur|pri&s;ed, that, notwith&s;tanding it was religious. I e&s;teemed it highly. In &s;hort, I became delighted with the&s;e occa&s;ional recreations from the jargon of congou, bohea, &s;ouchong, and hy&s;on.</P>
<P>"Sill more delighted was I to li&s;ten to her, while &s;he qualified the doctrines of Calvini&s;m, and labour|ed to reconcile the benevolence of the Creator with the doom of the created, and the unborn. Her language was warm:&mdash;her colourings exhibited the &s;tronge&s;t lights, and deepe&s;t &s;hades. She &s;taggered my rea&s;on, opened new &s;cenes to my view, and &s;o far conquered my objections, as to make me wi&s;h and pray that I could believe her creed.</P>
<P>"She perceived the cri&s;is, and gave me permi&s;|&s;ion to take what books I plea&s;ed from her book|ca&s;e, which contained the whole body of Calvini&s;tic divinity. Thus two or three years pa&s;&s;ed away, at the expiration of which I had become a zealous Cal|vini&s;t.</P>

<P>"I was about &s;eventeen years old, when Mr. Nutting, one evening, was &s;ent for in great ha&s;te to vi&s;it a &s;tranger who had lately taken a lodging at the next door, and who was then at the point of death.</P>
<P>"This &s;tranger was a man, who, having obtain|ed early in life the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, had given the reins to his pa&s;&s;ions, and had indulged in every plea&s;ure that a vitiated ta&s;te and corrupt principles &s;ugge&s;ted.

<P>"There was only one object living, for whom, in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, he felt any concern; and that was a daughter, the fruit of an illicit amour in the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>"This daughter he had brought up with the true affection of a father, having be&s;towed a very libe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|al expence upon her education at a very eminent &s;chool in the vicinity of the metropolis, where &s;he then re&s;ided as a boarder.</P>
<P>"For this daughter Captain Elli&s;on felt an increa|&s;ing concern as his own end drew nearer.

"Such, at length, was the confidence he repo&s;ed in Mr. Nutting, that he made a will, by which he bequeathed an e&s;tate in Hertford&s;hire, and &s;ome con&s;iderable property in the funds, to his daughter, upon the expre&s;s condition of her re&s;iding with Mr. Nutting till her twenty-fifth year, or till her mar|riage with his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>"So &s;trictly was his will drawn up, that Mr. Nutting, who was his &s;ole executor, obtained by it an unlimited controul over his ward during her minority, and an arbitrary di&s;po&s;al of her in mar|riage, be&s;ides the intere&s;t of her property while &s;he re&s;ided in his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>"The Captain died. Mi&s;s Elli&s;on had vi&s;ited him two or three times at his lodgings, and was ap|prized of his intentions re&s;pecting her. A day was appointed for her removal, and I was ordered by my ma&s;ter to take a coach from Hyde Park-Corner to Ken&s;ington, to bring Mi&s;s Elli&s;on and her appur|tenances to the &s;trand.</P>
<P>"Well do I remember the &s;cene at Ken&s;ington.

I obeyed &s;o much of my ma&s;ter's orders as to carry the box into the loft, and intended to fini&s;h my commi&s;&s;ion when I went to my chamber, which was one &s;tory lower than the loft. But, O, &s;overeign genius&mdash;invinci|ble power&mdash;inextingui&s;hable &s;park!&mdash;then, again, thy &s;mothered embers blazed!</P>
<P>"Taking my candle and my hammar, I a&s;cended the loft, I placed my candle on the floor, and was about to drive the nail, when a &s;udden impul&s;e of curio&s;ity arre&s;ted my arm.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;e, thought I, I ju&s;t look over the&s;e books. They are profane, &s;aid Calvin; they are the pro|ductions of men de&s;titute of the enlightening &s;pirits of God, and may tend to draw your affections from holy things.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Only one peep, cried curio&s;ity; perhaps I may meet &s;ome old acquaintance that I have almo&s;t for|gotten; for it was full three years &s;ince I had look|ed into any book &s;ave the theological labours of Cal|vini&s;ts.</P>
<P>"Down I dropped upon my knees. 'If it be a &s;in, God forgive it; if it is temptation, Lord deliver me.' I opened the box, trembling; I took up a volume and opened it. It was a volume of Shake&s;|pear, and the pa&s;&s;age that caught my eye was the &s;peech of Portia on mercy. As I read, my heart grew warm; as I proceeded, it grew warmer; and when I came to the line&mdash;'It is an attribute of God him&s;elf,' it literally glowed within me.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="038596_0044_10129E848A96E830">
"This &s;peech had been my favourite at &s;chool, and I had &s;pouted it an hundred times. It brought to my recollection another, for which I eagerly &s;earched and found in the &s;ame author: 'O gentle &s;leep, &amp;c.' My &s;pirits &s;eemed to have gained a deliverance from fetters; my heart beat quicker than for a long time pa&s;t; and I went on devouring the contents of the box with as much appetite as a hungry man would a dinner. I ta&s;ted every di&s;h that pre&s;ented it&s;elf, and found each di&s;h a dainty. Nearly at the bot|tom of the box was a volume of Sir Charles Grandi|&s;on, which I opened at the intere&s;ting conver&s;ation of Sir Charles and Lady Clementina upon the topic of religion. Conceive the intere&s;t I felt; and judge my regret when I heard the clock &s;trike three, and &s;aw the approaching departure of my light, which glimmered in the &s;ocket of the candle&s;tick. I found my way to bed in the dark; but &s;leep was far off.</P>
<P>"The &s;pring of rea&s;on, that had been &s;tretched to impotence by bigotry, &s;eemed by this accident to have recovered its ela&s;ticity, and once more re&s;umed its operations&mdash;O Super&s;tition, how great|ly to thy prejudice!</P>
<P>"I recollected the &s;cene in Mi&s;s Elli&s;on's cham|ber. I placed before my fancy the ignorant piety of my ma&s;ter, and the profane intelligence of his ward. I dared even to trace the origin of their principles. I did more; I inquired, if it was a con|&s;i&s;tent idea, to &s;uppo&s;e a beneficent Creator would grant a &s;pecial light to a few of his creatures, by which they only &s;hould be guided to eternal bli&s;s; while the multitude are doomed to wander through a dark pa&s;&s;age to the precipice of everla&s;ting woe? And when I had inquired&mdash;I blu&s;hed!"</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN George arrived at the baronet's, a coun|cil was &s;itting to con&s;ider of proper mea&s;ures to be adopted relative to the nightly appearances at the abbey.</P>
<P>George had been meditating all the way from old Mental's upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, and had determined to watch this night among the ruins. Over-ruling every objection that was &s;tarted, he abided by his re&s;olution; and when the re&s;t of the family retired to their chambers, he muffled him&s;elf up in a box coat, armed him&s;elf with a brace of pi&s;tols, and &s;al|lied forth towards the ruins.</P>
<P>Darkne&s;s and &s;ilence reigned; with difficulty he di&s;covered his way, and ere he reached the ai&s;le, the echoes of the midnight chimes rolled among&s;t the ruins. At the &s;ame moment he ob&s;erved a light|ed torch glide &s;lowly towards the avenue that led to the ai&s;le: at the entrance the per&s;on who carried it turned round&mdash;George &s;tepped behind a column, and &s;aw the &s;ame ma&s;ked figure he had beheld on the preceding evening.</P>
<P>After gazing earne&s;tly round him for a few &s;e|conds, the figure moved &s;lowly towards the ai&s;le. With a gentle tread George followed him, but &s;top|ped at the entrance of the ai&s;le, and reclined his head again&s;t the remains of a &s;tone arched gate|way, in the attitude of li&s;tening.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently the tones of a harp &s;truck his ear: they were &s;olemn, &s;low, and melancholy. After a few intere&s;ting movements, a voice accompanied the in|&s;trument. George could no longer re&s;i&s;t the im|pul&s;e

of curio&s;ity; but, creeping &s;oftly, entered the ai&s;le. The Unknown &s;at with his back to the en|trance upon a little &s;tool, near the tomb, upon which lay his ma&s;k. A lamp burnt upon the ground, and the torch was extingui&s;hed. The anxiety of his mind prevented George from hearing di&s;tinctly the words of a ballad, but of which his memory re|tained the following fragment.&mdash;</P>

During the time this ballad was &s;inging, George &s;tood motionle&s;s, with his eyes fixed on the &s;inger. When it was concluded, he withdrew a few paces back, to a &s;pot where he might &s;ee, unob&s;erved, what &s;hould pa&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had fini&s;hed this ballad, which ap|peared to agitate him extremely, the Unknown &s;tart|ed from his &s;eat, and, cla&s;ping his hands together violently, exclaimed&mdash;"O! what torments&mdash;what tortures could cruelty invent equal to thy &s;tings&mdash;thy &s;corpion &s;tings&mdash;O, inward hell of guilt!&mdash;O, con&s;cience! Am I for everla&s;ting to endure the&s;e pangs? And will this worm for ever live within me?&mdash;O! that a blow could &s;trangle it;&mdash;that leaping into burning liquid could annihilate all thought! Why&mdash;why&mdash;fool that I am&mdash;why do I he&s;itate to try?"</P>
<P>As he uttered the la&s;t words he drew a pi&s;tol from his bo&s;om&mdash;"This, in a moment, brings me to my&mdash;Would I could &s;ay, my end! But, no&mdash;no&mdash;no!&mdash;She did not cea&s;e to be, when this accur&s;ed arm plunged this bloody &s;teel into her beauteous brea&s;t! (holding up a dagger, bloody at the point)&mdash;"Some|where &s;he &s;till exi&s;ts; for &s;till her &s;pirit haunts her ruthle&s;s murderer!&mdash;&s;teals from his pillow peace; and makes the light of day more hedious than dark and gloomy night!&mdash;meets me in every walk&mdash;cro&s;&s;es me in every path; and here&mdash;even here&mdash;where like an outca&s;t wretch I mourn away my nights&mdash;here, too, it follows me, and makes a hell. O, wretch!&mdash;wretch!"</P>
<P>As he &s;poke, he threw his arms upon the tomb, and buried his face in his hands. The &s;u&s;picions of George were ju&s;t: his voice, his face, declared this confe&s;&s;or of murder to be Mental. Horror and a&s;toni&s;hment &s;truck him to the &s;oul; he tremb|led, and &s;huddered at the di&s;covery, while a varying train of ideas floated in his brain.</P>
<P>In a few minutes his attention was again arre&s;ted. Mental exclaimed&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="038596_0048_10129E9030320B10">
"Away this dream of horror! Was &s;he not faithle&s;s?" And then, in a &s;ofter tone&mdash;"Yes, <HI>faithle&s;s</HI> as <HI>fair!"</HI></P>
<P>He flew to his harp, and moving his fingers bri&s;kly, &s;eemed endeavouring to recollect &s;ome air. "Aye&mdash;that was a favourite," cried he: "how char|mingly did &s;he look when her &s;now-white arms were extended to touch the&s;e &s;trings&mdash;her flaxen hair flowing in ringlets about her lovely neck&mdash;her expre&s;&s;ive eyes beaming glances of love upon me&mdash;while her coral lips moved to the melody of an angel's voice!&mdash;And yet I could de&s;troy her!&mdash;could change that breathing beauty into putrefac|tion! I was that mon&s;ter; and now, like an in|fant that has broke his toy, I could &s;it down and weep a life a way! O! if repentance were availing&mdash;what do I not &s;uffer! Fooli&s;h mankind!&mdash;among thy race how many a holy penitent have I viewed who&s;e lengthened vi&s;age, and briny eye, has &s;oothed away remor&s;e! Why, then, in what a mould was I formed, that my wounds &s;hould re&s;i&s;t all healing applications? Is there no bal&s;am that may cure my &s;oul?&mdash;'Phy&s;ician, Omnipotent Phy&s;ician!&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here he &s;unk upon his knees; but in a moment &s;tarting up&mdash;</P>
<P>"Mental! ar't turning Monk," exclaimed he, "as if an interce&s;&s;ion could more avail with the All-powerful than his own benevolence? Call back time pa&s;t&mdash;undo pa&s;t deeds&mdash;bid the dead live&mdash;and then expect the peace that thou ha&s;t parted with for ever!"</P>
<P>Not a &s;yllable that &s;ell from the lips of this mi&s;e|rable man was lo&s;t by George. Three hours pa&s;|&s;ed away, during which Mental occa&s;ionally broke out into &s;imilar ejaculations, or played upon the harp. Soon as a di&s;tant bell tolled three, he lit his torch; and removing a large and heavy &s;tone, which lay at &s;ome di&s;tance from the tomb, a kind of grave appeared, in which he depo&s;ited the harp, the lamp,
<PB N="50" REF="038596_0049_10129E9305A51568">
and the &s;tool, and replaced the &s;tone; then ma&s;k|ing him&s;elf, he left the ai&s;le, and George, at a cautious di&s;tance, followed him.</P>

<P>UNDETERMINED in his mind, whether to reveal or conceal the di&s;covery of the preceding night, George joined the family at breakfa&s;t.

<P>Fortunately a letter arrived from the knight, which turned the conver&s;ation from a &s;ubject that George would have encountered &s;ome difficulty in di&s;gui&s;ing, and which he did not wi&s;h to reveal till he had heard the &s;equel of old Mental's &s;tory.</P>

Emery knows what he is about; and though I have not been in town the&s;e &s;ix years, he &s;ends me &s;uch accounts that make me as ea&s;y and as comfortable as if I look|ed over the ledger every night.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I hope it is unnece&s;&s;ary to repeat, that your wi&s;hes will ever be con&s;idered by me in the nature of commands, which it is my duty to obey; be&s;ides, I perfectly agree with you that Sir James's propo&s;al is extremely liberal: three thou&s;and pounds down, and &s;even when the young man is admitted to an eighth of the profits, con&s;idering he is to take an active part, is an offer, in my opinion, not to be re|fu&s;ed. As the nephew of Sir James Barnwell, I think he &s;hould dome&s;ticate with me; and as your

<P>VARIOUS were the emotions which agitated the mind of young Barnwell, as he &s;trolled towards the hou&s;e of Mr. Mental. When he was introduced into his pre&s;ence, he trembled.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="038596_0052_10129E9BE3C0E888">
"Ere we parted, Sir," &s;aid Mental, abruptly, "I think I had introduced Mi&s;s Elli&s;on to your acquain|tance, and be&s;towed &s;ome prai&s;e upon her per&s;on. It is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to pourtray her mind, at once &s;imple and noble, conde&s;cending and dignified. I will not attempt even to &s;ketch its outlines, but &s;hall confine my&s;elf to a &s;ingle narrative of facts, in which her actions will more faithfully unfold her mind, than can the mo&s;t labouring de&s;cription.</P>
<P>"However di&s;&s;imilar the manners of the Nuttings were to tho&s;e which a poli&s;hed &s;tate had made her own; however abhorrent their gloomy notions of religion to a mind of exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, and an under&s;tanding of uncommon &s;trength and cultivation; having once brought her&s;elf to believe it her duty to obey the injunctions of her father's will, &s;he &s;ub|mitted, without &s;ullenne&s;s, to their mode of life, and paid a decent re&s;pect to tho&s;e duties which their re|ligion enjoined them to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>"But do not imagine &s;he played the hypocrite. She never avowed her di&s;&s;ent from their doctrines. and &s;crupled not to confe&s;s her di&s;like at their re|clu&s;e way of living. Honored&mdash;&s;hall I not &s;ay ble&s;|&s;ed&mdash;with the confidence of this charming woman, my &s;ituation &s;eemed changed from the mo&s;t cheer|le&s;s to the mo&s;t bli&s;sful. We read, we conver&s;ed together; we wrote, and &s;ubmitted our performan|ces to the critici&s;ms of each other. In &s;hort, we &s;eemed mutually to confe&s;s, that in that hou&s;e, at lea&s;t, there was no plea&s;ure but in each other's &s;ocie|ty. What the library in the loft had left unfini&s;h|ed, Mi&s;s Elli&s;on's conver&s;ation completed; and my &s;oul once again glowed with hope.</P>
<P>"I looked forward with impatience to the ter|mination of my &s;ervitude, when I imagined, I &s;hould bur&s;t forth upon the world as a prodigy of genius.

<P>"The con&s;equence of this di&s;covery was an abridgment of the opportunities of conver&s;ing with my Elinor, and a more rigid line of conduct towards Mi&s;s Elli&s;on her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Shortly after this event, another occurred of mo&s;t deci&s;ive con&s;equences towards us both. A relation of Mrs. Nutting was taken ill, and re|que&s;ted her attendance. She went to re&s;ide with her a few weeks at Hamp&s;tead. On the Saturdays Mr. Nutting went to &s;leep there, and returned u&s;ually on the Monday morning. Mi&s;s Elli&s;on was left in the Strand, as a guardian to the hou&s;e. On one of the&s;e Saturdays Elinor and my&s;elf had planned to bribe the old woman, I have mentioned as the &s;er|vant, to &s;ecrecy, and to embrace the opportunity of going to a play. The old dame, would never have con&s;ented to our vi&s;iting the 'Devil's Hou&s;e,' as &s;he termed the theatre; and therefore it became nece&s;|&s;ary to deceive her with the tale of a vi&s;it we were going to pay Mrs. Herris, the former governe&s;s of Mi&s;s Elli&s;on. To this &s;he yielded, after a few <HI>weighty</HI> arguments.</P>
<P>"I can now &s;ee a great incon&s;i&s;tency in Mi&s;s Elli&s;on's conduct, as well as a great impropriety in my own, in thus abu&s;ing the confidence placed in us both. But, Sir, at the moment I am &s;peaking of, temptation was irre&s;i&s;tible; you cannot conceive its &s;trength.</P>
<P>"Elinor was as pa&s;&s;ionately fond of theatrical performances as my&s;elf. I had not &s;een one in the &s;pace of four years, nor had &s;he &s;ince her entrance into our family; nor was there the remote&s;t proba|bility that any other opportunity would occur during our &s;tay with the Nuttings.</P>

"The play to be performed that evening was Shake&s;pear's Romeo and Juliet; and the Romeo was Garrick.</P>
<P>"There were &s;everal &s;cruples to conquer; but, in the end, temptation triumphed.</P>
<P>"Taking &s;ome precautions to di&s;gui&s;e our per|&s;ons, we went and mingled with the crowd that had a&s;&s;embled at the pit door of Drury Lane theatre. Unaccu&s;tomed to the place, and &s;urrounded com|pletely by a concour&s;e of people, Elinor began to tremble with terror.</P>
<P>"The attraction of Garrick had drawn an unu&s;ual throng: the heat and pre&s;&s;ure became almo&s;t in&s;up|portable to Mi&s;s Elli&s;on, and, added to her fright, at length overpowered to endure it. She told me that &s;he felt her&s;elf fainting. I attempted to make a retreat through the crowd. It was impo&s;&s;ible. She faint|ed in my arms. At the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame in&s;tant the doors open|ed, and, being deprived of the u&s;e of my arms, we both &s;unk together, and I became &s;en&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>"When my &s;en&s;es returned, I found my&s;elf in a &s;trange bed, with &s;everal per&s;ons &s;tanding round me. A&s;toni&s;hment &s;eized me for a moment; but when the memory of the &s;cene that had pa&s;&s;ed recurred, it was like an arrow &s;hot through my brain&mdash;'The lady!&mdash;the lady!&mdash;Elinor!&mdash;Mi&s;s Elli&s;on!&mdash;is &s;he alive!&mdash;where is &s;he!' exclaimed I in the agony of the mo&s;t torturing &s;u&s;pen&s;e. In lifting my hands to my head, I found I had been bled.</P>
<P>"The people around me &s;tared in my face, and at one another, but made no reply to my que&s;tions. 'My God! will you not tell me?' They &s;hook their heads in &s;ign of pity. 'She is dead!&mdash;&s;he is mur|dered then!' exclaimed I. 'Poor youth!' cried a man who &s;tood neare&s;t to me; 'poor youth!&mdash;his brain is quite di&s;ordered. I believe we mu&s;t take a little more blood.' 'You'd better look, who&s;e to pay you, fir&s;t,' cried a fat man in a red wor&s;ted cap; 'I think in&s;tead of bleeding, we'd better &s;ee and get

'Why, as to that, Mr. Brown,' cried a decent-looking man, 'where could we take him &s;o proper:&mdash;who would have thought, to look at him, but that he was dead; and in that ca&s;e, the coroner would have &s;at upon the body at your hou&s;e, and you'd have had no ob|jection.</P>
<P>"Where am I, then? exclaimed I&mdash;'Where are you!' cried the fat man:&mdash;'why, you're at the Dolphin, in Drury Lane: and as you &s;eem in your &s;en&s;es now, young man, pray, where do you live&mdash;who are your friends?'</P>
<P>"My God! what a thunderbolt was this que&s;tion. In&s;tead of an&s;wering this man, I repeated my que&s;|tions concerning Elinor, but could procure no in|telligence. My anxiety made me &s;trong. I deter|mined to ari&s;e; nor could the whole College of phy|&s;icians have prevailed upon me to relinqui&s;h my pur|po&s;e. I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf with a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I was &s;evere|ly brui&s;ed in &s;everal places, but had received no mate|rial injury.</P>
<P>It was nine o'clock when I left the Dolphin. My inquiries after Elinor were for along time fruitle&s;s. All the intelligence that I could gather in the neighbourhood of the theatre was, that a young lady had been tramp|led to death, and conveyed away in a hackney coach, but whither, nobody knew.</P>
<P>"I went home, with a faint hope that &s;he might have been conveyed thither. I rung the bell; the old woman appeared, and her fir&s;t inquiry was&mdash;'What have you done with Mi&s;s?'</P>
<P>"Without an&s;wering her que&s;tion, I ran away I returned back to the door&mdash;Again I left it, and, from the anxiety of mind, played the antics of a madman.</P>
<P>"The whole of the night <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wandered up and down the &s;treets, &s;topping every hackney coach, inquiring of every pa&s;&s;enger after the object of my &s;earch&mdash;Imagination tormented me with a thou&s;and horrible

ideas&mdash;I &s;aw her dead!&mdash;wor&s;e than dead!&mdash;I &s;aw her per&s;on violated!&mdash;I heard her &s;hrieks!&mdash;I &s;aw her agonies!&mdash;and my rea&s;on ab&s;olutely reeled. Morning appeared; I had walked the whole night; I had taken no refre&s;hment; and I found my&s;elf &s;ink|ing with fatigue.</P>
<P>"As I pa&s;&s;ed the Chapter Coffee-Hou&s;e in St. Paul's church yard, the &s;ervants were taking down the &s;hutters. I went in; and, leaning my head upon a table, indulged a &s;ile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> grief. I remained in this po&s;ture &s;ome time, till &s;everal per&s;ons came into the room. After them was a &s;hort, neat looking man, who &s;eated him&s;elf near me&mdash;'How is your patient this morning, Mr. Brookes?' &s;aid a gentleman to him. 'She &s;till remains in&s;en&s;ible,' replied he; 'but her fever is lower.' 'Poor thing!' &s;aid the other, 'and was there nothing about her that could give you any idea who &s;he is? There are &s;ome aching hearts on her account by this time.'</P>
<P>"Merciful Providence!&mdash;have I then found her? exclaimed I&punc; in a tone that alarmed the whole com|pany.</P>
<P>"If you have any heart!&mdash;if you would relieve the mo&s;t wretched being on earth!&mdash;continued I; pray take me to my Elinor.</P>
<P>"The people gathered round me with a&s;toni&s;h|ment. An ecclairci&s;&s;ement took place. It was my Elinor. The humanity of Mr. Brookes, who was a re&s;pectable book&s;eller, had &s;aved her life; and &s;he was then at his hou&s;e in Paterno&s;ter Row.</P>
<P>"I &s;aw her, but &s;he knew me not; though, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> morning &s;entences &s;he uttered, my name was often mentioned. A phy&s;ician attended her, who pronounced her out of danger.</P>
<P>"Relieved from the heavie&s;t part of my anxiety, I had now lei&s;ure to think of my own &s;ituation; but could not re&s;olve how to act. Mr. Nutting I dared not to &s;ee; Mr. Darwall I &s;huddered to meet.</P>
<P>"I made Mr. Brookes my confidante, who humane|ly offered me an a&s;ylum in his own hou&s;e, till he
<PB N="59" REF="038596_0058_10129EAD48072530">
could reconcile me to Mr. Nutting, or at lea&s;t to Mr. Darwall, whom he determined to &s;ee the following morning.</P>
<P>"His endeavours were unavailing with both. The former firmly prote&s;ted again&s;t ever receiving me again into his hou&s;e; and &s;o repre&s;ented me to the latter, that his heart was completely &s;teeled again&s;t me. Thus did one trivial event deprive me of the only friend I had on earth. Thus were nearly five years of my life fooled away, without affording the lea&s;t advantage to my&s;elf, or &s;atisfaction to my ben|efactor.</P>
<P>"I had now, indeed, my liberty; but indepen|dence came too late, and in too melancholy a way.</P>
<P>"I perceive, Mr. Barnwell, I mu&s;t be le&s;s prolix. One incident leads on in&s;en&s;ibly to another. I mu&s;t content my&s;elf, therefore, with a more general ac|count.</P>
<P>"Pa&s;&s;ing over, then, many tender and affecting interviews I had with Mi&s;s Elli&s;on, on her recovery, at the hou&s;e of Mr. Brookes, ere &s;he was well enough to be removed to her guardian's, I will confine my|&s;elf to the one in which a mutual confe&s;&s;ion of love, (for we really loved) took place.</P>
<P>"She had that morning received a letter from Mr. Nutting, urging her return.</P>
<P>"And when do you mean to go, Mi&s;s Elli&s;on? &s;aid I.</P>
<P>'Never! replied &s;he with firmne&s;s. 'I will not &s;acrifice independence and happine&s;s to wealth!'</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Elli&s;on, are you &s;erious?</P>
<P>'I am re&s;olved. I went there in obedience to my father's will. I found the &s;ituation barely tolerable.</P>
<P>After this unfortunate accident it will no longer be &s;o. I &s;hall, therefore, relinqui&s;h all claim to my fortune, and retain the rights of a human being!'</P>
<P>"My God, Elinor!&mdash;Madam, what are you pur|&s;uing&mdash;what means of living, what pro&s;pects even of a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence have you in view?&mdash;</P>
<P>"Let me retort your que&s;tions, Sir&mdash;You have

<P>'I&mdash;I&mdash;Madam&mdash;I&mdash;I am a man&mdash;</P>
<P>'And is the privilege of procuring a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence confined to men exclu&s;ively? Have women, then, no hands to labour, no judgment to plan, or re&s;olu|tion to pur&s;ue a project? I am ready to concede to your &s;ex &s;uperior prowe&s;s in bodily exerci&s;es; but I am yet to be convinced, that nature made the female that pa&s;&s;ive animal, which cu&s;tom exhibits in our cities. My re&s;olution is fixed&mdash;my plan is arranged&mdash;Mr. Brookes approves it&mdash;at lea&s;t acquie&s;ces in it.</P>
<P>May I a&s;k the nature of it?</P>
<P>'I have no de&s;ire to keep it a &s;ecret, particularly from you. I am going to commence author by pro|fe&s;&s;ion. For the pre&s;ent I &s;hall remain in his hou&s;e, as a boarder. 'Tis no ha&s;tily formed project, but the re&s;ult of &s;erious con&s;ideration.'</P>
<P>I was &s;truck dumb with &s;urpri&s;e and regret.</P>
<P>'What ails you, Mental?' &s;aid he; 'are you unwell?'</P>
<P>Why did you not acquaint me with this plan ye&s;terday? &s;aid I. It perhaps would have been po&s;&s;ible to have procured &s;ome &s;imilar employ my&s;elf.</P>
<P>'Certainly nothing is more ea&s;y. Mr. Brookes him&s;elf means to offer you a propo&s;al this very day.'</P>
<P>Why did he not propo&s;e it ye&s;terday?</P>
<P>'What happened ye&s;terday, then, Sir? Is it too late? Tell me, what of ye&s;terday?'</P>
<P>"O, Madam!&mdash;O, Elinor!&mdash;ye&s;terday was a fa|tal day. Depre&s;&s;ed with gloomy ideas, I wandered through the bu&s;y &s;treets of this metropolis, rumina|ting on the pa&s;t, and on the future. I looked back, without much regret, at what I have left, but with &s;orrow at what I have done. I had &s;acrificed the mo&s;t important part of life to an implicit &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to another's judgment. I had lo&s;t that <HI>"tide in the affairs of men, which leads to fortune,"</HI> and nothing but mi&s;eries and &s;hallows pre&s;ented them&s;elves in the

<HI>re&s;t of my voyage.'</HI> In all the boundle&s;s ocean of fu|turity I could behold no &s;ingle &s;pot on which to ca&s;t Hope's anchor.</P>
<P>"As I walked on, mu&s;ing in this &s;train, the car|riage of a celebrated Pleader pa&s;&s;ed me, in which he lolled at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e; and oppo&s;ite to him &s;at his &s;on, a youth &s;eemingly about my own age. I &s;ighed; per|haps (I ought to own the truth) I envied him. Yes, Elinor, envied him; for that which is emulation where competition is open, is envy where it is &s;hut.</P>
<P>"Would I were that happy youth, &s;ighed I. What admirable exerci&s;e for the mind does &s;uch a profe&s;|&s;ion open!&mdash;what opportunities for di&s;playing its powers! And it is mere prejudice to imagine a man cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s a liberal mind, who is a lawyer.</P>
<P>"The carriage &s;topped&mdash;In&s;tinctively I followed them into the Guild Hall. The courts were &s;itting. A cau&s;e was arguing&mdash;I li&s;tened&mdash;I became intere&s;ted in the arguments&mdash;I wondered at the omi&s;&s;ion of many, which would have made for or again&s;t the que&s;tion. The judge ro&s;e to give his opinion. I had anticipated much that he &s;aid. My proud heart fluttered; I was a pleader in imagination, I applauded my&s;elf&mdash;was happy in my fancies. The verdict was given; the crowd di&s;per&s;ed; and then&mdash;I felt <HI>what I really was!</HI></P>
<P>"As the concour&s;e of people &s;eparated at the door, one cried, &s;haking another's hand&mdash;'I mu&s;t go&mdash;&s;o and &s;o&mdash;&s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s calls me.' Another replied&mdash;'I &s;hould have been at &s;uch a place.' Every one appeared to be running after &s;ome object that occu|pied his mind, and brought emolument to him&s;elf. 'And where &s;hall I go!' &s;ighed I.</P>
<P>"In King Street I met a mob, dragging a poor ragged wretch to ju&s;tice, who had been detected in picking a pocket. I mingled with the crowd to hear the examination&mdash;'What means have you of get|ting a livelihood?' &s;aid the magi&s;trate.

Phrenzy &s;eized me&mdash;I ran to the lieutenant, and offered him my hand&mdash;'I'll &s;erve the King!' cried I. The men pulled off their hats, and gave three cheers. The lieutenant &s;hook me by the hand; and, after looking in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> exclaimed with an oath&mdash;'Harry Mental! He had been my chum at Eton.'</P>
<P>'Merciful heaven! and I have been the cau&s;e of this,' cried Elinor.

<P>And again the tears would flow.</P>

<P>"The lieutenant being my friend, by his intere&s;t I obtained a di&s;charge from my ra&s;h engagement; and Elinor and my&s;elf were &s;hortly after married.</P>
<P>"Mr. Brookes continued the friendly rock on which we built our little bower of bli&s;s. His coun|&s;el directed, his benevolence aided, his genero&s;ity munificently remunerated our labours. He was engaged in a very exten&s;ive concern, and found us abundant employ. Elinor wrote a Novel, which &s;ucceeded well. We publi&s;hed jointly a volume of Poetry; and we mutually laboured at tran&s;lations.' Competence was the &s;weet reward of our labours, &s;upplying us with all the nece&s;&s;aries, and many of the decent luxuries of life. We re&s;ided in a &s;mall but neat cottage at Walworth; only vi&s;iting the metropolis occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P>"The life I now lead was the very reality of that picture which imagination had taught my youthful heart to doat upon; and yet, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this reality, I was not content. When literary compo&s;itions be|came the means of my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, I found it irk&s;ome; I fancied it a mean employ of talent to let out for hire. I grew di&s;&s;atisfied, I formed a variety of new &s;chemes, which alternately delighted and di&s;gu&s;ted me.</P>
<P>"A period however approached, which compelled me to &s;ubmit to the irk&s;omene&s;s, and even meanne&s;s (as I deemed it,) of my employment. My Elinor bore me a daughter. I wept tears of joy; my heart beat with rapture; for at that moment, Sir, I did not dream how many cur&s;es, in di&s;gui&s;e, I hailed as ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;I &s;ometimes laugh to think how my &s;illy heart was cheated."</P>

<P>A chain of conjectures on poor Mental's tale oc|cupied his mind till he reached home, when a fre&s;h occurrence demanded his attention.</P>
<P>Upon entering the drawing-room, he &s;tarted back with &s;urpri&s;e, at the &s;ight of the harp, the lamp, and the &s;tool, which he had the preceding night &s;een de|po&s;ited by Mental, under the &s;tone in the haunted ai&s;le. There was nobody in the room&mdash;he had found the hall door open, and had entered without &s;eeing any of the &s;ervants. De&s;cending the &s;tair|ca&s;e he met old Jo&s;eph.&mdash;</P>

<P>"At the haunted ai&s;le, Sir. Have you not &s;een the mu&s;ic, and the lamp?"</P>
<P>"Yes:&mdash;but how were they di&s;covered?"</P>
<P>"I di&s;covered them&mdash;" with an air of impatience. "This morning, Sir, I was going to the doctor's for &s;ome con&s;erve of ro&s;es, for Mrs. Meredith, the hou&s;e|keeper, who has got a terrible blight in her eyes, as I take it, by &s;itting in the garden when the night air&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Well&mdash;well, Jo&s;eph&mdash;you were going to the doctor's&mdash;never mind what about."</P>
<P>"True, Sir, as you &s;ay, that's no matter; that's neither here nor there as to the di&s;covery. Well, Sir, the neare&s;t way to Doctor Saffron lies through the park, and the ruins; and though I have many times gone round by the road way for fear, I was determined this morning to go boldly on through the haunted ai&s;le: and &s;o I did; for, &s;ince our &s;earch there, I began to think le&s;s of the matter than I u&s;ed to do. I did tremble a little, to be &s;ure, when I got there; but &s;ome how or other, as if Providence had ordered it &s;o, I grew bold when I had been there a while; and finding my&s;elf a little fatigued with my walk, I &s;its me down boldly upon the very tomb where they &s;ay the naked lady &s;its every night. Now only mind, Sir, what great di&s;coveries &s;ometimes happen from trifling things. I had a hat on that was bran new la&s;t Sunday; the day was hot, &s;o I pulls off my hat, and lies it down upon the tomb.&mdash;Well when I had re&s;ted me, I takes my hat up, and, behold, all the top of the crown was &s;oaked in lamp oil. I was &s;truck very &s;trange, to think how this could happen:&mdash;when, lo, and behold ye, I find a quantity of oil, as if it had been &s;pilt upon the tomb &s;tone; and I find it had dripped, dripped, dripped, all the way along the <HI>moniment</HI> to a large &s;tone covered over with mo&s;s, and beyond that &s;tone not a drop of oil was there to be &s;een or &s;melt. Then all of a &s;udden, it came into my head about the light that has been &s;o often &s;een of a night. And&mdash;"</P>

"Enough&mdash;enough&mdash;" cried George with his u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity of temper&mdash;"I know the re&s;t, good Jo&s;eph, and will &s;pare you the trouble of re|citing it&mdash;You moved the &s;tone&mdash;and there the harp and the lamp was &s;ound&mdash;But here comes Sir James."</P>
<P>"The &s;trange&s;t di&s;coveries!" &s;aid the baronet.</P>
<P>"Jo&s;eph has been relating it, Sir," replied George.</P>
<P>"Well," continued the knight&mdash;"and what con|jectures do you draw from it?"</P>
<P>Mr. Sandall, Mrs. and Mi&s;s Barnwell joined them.</P>
<P>"The mu&s;ic that has been heard, and the rights that have been &s;een, are rationally accounted for, at lea&s;t, by this di&s;covery," &s;aid Gearge; but the performer of the&s;e nocturnal orgies we have yet to di&s;cover. I &s;hould think, Mr. Sandall, a gho&s;t would not be at the trouble of hiding tho&s;e things?"</P>
<P>Mr. Sandall was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"It &s;eems a &s;trange propen&s;ity," &s;aid Sir James, "in any man to amu&s;e him&s;elf in &s;uch midnight re|creations. I know nobody I could &s;u&s;pect of &s;uch exploits; unle&s;s, indeed, the &s;trange old fellow, who is the proprietor of the ruins."</P>
<P>"And who el&s;e would you &s;u&s;pect, Sir James," &s;aid Sandall, "Is not the man known to be every thing that's bad? Who knows for what infernal purpo&s;es he might hold his nightly &s;ittings there? The&s;e are &s;trange times, Sir James. I was reading to you the Hi&s;tory of the Illuminati, a book which proves the exi&s;tence of con&s;pirators again&s;t all the world; and I believe that this country is not free from them. The place is retired; Mental's hou&s;e is large; and no one is &s;een to enter his door by day light. Now, who knows but he may entertain in that hou&s;e, or have concealed about the ruins a gang of the&s;e horrible villains, who would go any lengths to overturn all religion and order. I &s;hould not pre|&s;ume to dictate to you, Sir James; but you are a
<PB N="67" REF="038596_0066_10129EBD68F8A9A8">
Magi&s;trate, Sir James; and a hint to a man of your penetration is &s;ufficient.&mdash;"</P>
<P>George would certainly have incurred the di&s;|plea&s;ure of the knight by a hearty laugh at his chap|lain, had he not been prevented by a noi&s;e in the hall below, and alarmed at the voice of Mental him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The rumour of the di&s;covery had &s;pread widely in a &s;hort time, and had gathered numberle&s;s addi|tions in its progre&s;s: till at length the &s;tory of a mur|der, committed by Mental, had actually gathered an a&s;&s;embly of pea&s;antry about his gate, who were point|ing to his hou&s;e, and &s;ignificantly lifting up their hands and eyes to heaven. The old man had noticed them; and by piecemeal had obtained information of the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Rudely ru&s;hing into the drawing room, to the extreme terror of Mr. Sandall and the ladies; his head covered, his hands clenched, his eyes darted anger and revenge&mdash;"By what authority, what law&mdash;by the &s;hew of what prerogative, is my proper|ty removed from my own &s;tate, and placed here? exclaimed he&mdash;"Yet do not an&s;wer me! I know the tale that hangs upon your lips. But I demand to know the author of tho&s;e vile calumnies, which the deluded pea&s;antry are blowing round my dwelling. I think, I trace the infamous &s;ugge&s;tion in the cow|ard countenance of yonder prie&s;t," pointing to Mr. Sandall.</P>
<P>"Me!&mdash;me!" exclaimed Sandall, &s;kulking be|hind Sir James' chair. "Mr. Mental, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, I have had no hand whatever in the bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>"What! can you lie?" &s;aid Mental&mdash;"O, how ill does it become the man who&s;e lips &s;pout forth the pure&s;t and &s;ublime&s;t doctrines ever taught man|kind, to retail calumnies: How ill does it become a man, of any faith, to wound the reputation of his ab|&s;ent fellow; then &s;hrink at his approach, con&s;cious of the injury be&s;towed, and yet mo&s;t da&s;tardly di&s;own the blow!"</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="038596_0067_10129EC2E62507A8">
Mr. Sandall was of a pale complexion; but at this moment his lips were paler than his cheeks, and he could not &s;tand upright.</P>
<P>"Does your reverence know this man?" a&s;ked Mental. [It was farmer Cornall.] Sandall trembled. "The tale you have in&s;tilled in this man's ear, was wanton, or malicious. Be it as it may, Sir, it &s;hall be refuted. You have &s;pread &s;tories of en|chantment, necromancy, nay, of murder! to my prejudice; that I conceal banditti of Illuminati in my hou&s;e. Now, Sir James,"&mdash;to the knight&mdash;"you are a magi&s;trate&mdash;I &s;urrender my&s;elf on the charge of this zealous Protector of the chri&s;tian faith, and am your pri&s;oner till acquitted. Go to my &s;ervant, take the keys, &s;earch&punc; every room&mdash;nay I in&s;i&s;t on it&mdash;&s;earch every drawer, examine every paper. I fear no di&s;coveries."</P>
<P>After many objections, Sir James con&s;ented to vi&s;it the re&s;idence of Mr. Mental, as the only means of averting the threats of the labourers, a&s;&s;embled from the neighbouring villages, to pull down the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Accompanied by Mr. Sandall, and George, he walked towards the hou&s;e; and at the particular re|que&s;t of Sir James, Mental went with them, &s;miling as he pa&s;&s;ed the in&s;ulting throng a&s;&s;embled round them, which all the eloquence and authority of the knight could &s;carcely keep in order.</P>
<P>As they were entering the hou&s;e, Mental took an opportunity of whi&s;pering to George, unnoticed&mdash;"You have not tattled, boy?"</P>
<P>"I am no babbler," &s;aid George.</P>
<P>"Then whatever you may now ob&s;erve, be &s;ecret &s;till. However &s;trange or my&s;terious may appear my future conduct, at pre&s;ent di&s;clo&s;e nothing that you know concerning me." Then &s;queezing his hand&mdash;"Let this memorandum &s;ometimes claim a place for me in your thoughts!"&mdash;and he &s;ighed heavily, as he &s;lipped a miniature into his hands&mdash;George put it in his bo&s;om.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="038596_0068_10129EC5B6B49F98">
By this time they had reached the &s;itting and &s;leeping room&mdash;"Here, Sir James," &s;aid Mental, "I eat and &s;leep; 'tis my whim; there's no &s;tatute to the contrary, I believe, Mr. Chaplain! That clo|&s;et will open, by turning the handle of the lock. It contains my wardrobe, a few changes of linen, and a roquelaire. The bayonet and belt, that hang up|on that peg, I <HI>once wore,</HI> nay, I <HI>once u&s;ed!</HI> I drew hu|man blood with that weapon&mdash;<HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> blood, Mr. Sandall;&mdash;Engli&s;h blood, Sir James. 'Twas an un|happy cau&s;e: but I was then a &s;oldier in the ranks, and endeavoured to annihilate the powers of mind that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, for they were u&s;ele&s;s; and my arm &s;ent death where the di&s;cretion of my officers direc|ted. It makes me cold to think on it. I &s;ee the belt is mouldy, and the bayonet ru&s;ty. I wi&s;h they were buried in the plains of Quebec. There is nothing el&s;e worth notice in this room."</P>
<P>They entered the apartment of poor old Sarah, who was in tears.</P>
<P>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;Sarah&mdash;Come, come, dry the&s;e tears&mdash;I can bear any calamity better than to &s;ee a faithful creature, like you, mi&s;erable through my means," &s;aid Mental.</P>
<P>"It han't for my&s;elf, its for you I cry. I always thought it would come out.</P>
<P>"Come out!" &s;aid Sandall. "What do you mean, good woman?"</P>
<P>"O, the &s;tudy&mdash;the &s;tudy!"</P>
<P>"Poor wretch!" cried Mental.</P>
<P>"What about the &s;tudy, good woman?" &s;aid Sandall: and then taking Sir James' arm&mdash;"Come, lead us to the &s;tudy."</P>
<P>"<HI>I</HI> lead you to the &s;tudy!&mdash;God forbid! no, no&mdash;let <HI>them</HI> that <HI>will,</HI> go for me," cried Sarah.</P>
<P>George recollected her former dread of the &s;tudy.</P>
<P>"This faithful creature has re&s;ided with me twenty years," &s;aid Mental. "In all that time &s;he has not &s;een the in&s;ide of my &s;tudy. I &s;pend many hours there alone; and often the whole night if it

rains, and I am prevented from walking in the abbey, which I prefer in fine weather. The circum&s;tance has created a my&s;terious fear in poor Sarah's brain, and &s;he would not enter the &s;tudy, I believe, to &s;ave her life. But you &s;hall your&s;elves judge how little cau&s;e of terror exi&s;ts there."</P>
<P>As they were leaving the room, Sarah took an opportunity, unperceived by Mental, to pull Sandall by the coat, and make earne&s;t &s;igns to him not to go. George him&s;elf was &s;taggered for a moment by this circum&s;tance&mdash;But Sandall &s;eemed petrified with terror.</P>
<P>"Come, Sir James," &s;aid Mental, "I'll &s;hew you this &s;tudy."</P>
<P>"They moved on. At the door of the kitchen Sandall turned round, and perceived that Sarah had dropped upon her knees, and was in the attitude of praying. His knees tottered as he a&s;cended two &s;lights of &s;tairs, which led to a gallery, at the end of which was a door, which Mental informed them was the &s;tudy. He opened the door, and the fir&s;t object that &s;truck their &s;ight was, the lid of a coffin covered with black cloth: there was a plate fixed on it, with this in&s;cription&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>Mrs. Elinor Mental, Died July 12th, 1772; Aged 22.</Q></P>
<P>George ca&s;t his eyes curiou&s;ly about the &s;tudy, and appeared entering in his memory an inventory of its contents.</P>
<P>The coffin lid was placed upright in one corner of the room; on a corner &s;helf over it was a human &s;kull, in excellent pre&s;ervation; near it was a writing ta|ble, on which burnt a lamp, the &s;hutters of the windows being continually clo&s;ed; the floor was &s;trewed with books, pamphlets, and new&s;papers. A che&s;t under the de&s;k contained a large quantity of ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;cript. In another corner &s;tood an electrical machine, cov|ered with du&s;t, the cylinder broken. In another, a furnace had been rai&s;ed for chemical experiments, but had evidently been long in di&s;u&s;e, and was half
<PB N="71" REF="038596_0070_10129EC9308E6F68">
concealed by broken crucibles and charcoal du&s;t. The general appearance of the place conveyed the mo&s;t gloomy ideas, and its furniture con&s;tituted mel|ancholy memorandums of energies of mind decayed and faded; as tattered banners and broken helmets tell of &s;ome valiant arm laid low!</P>
<P>As Mental &s;tood with his arms folded, leaning again&s;t the wain&s;cot, Sir James and Mr Sandall al|ternately fixed an eye of wonder on the apartment and its my&s;terious owner. After a con&s;iderable &s;ilence&mdash;</P>
<P>"Well, Mr. Sandall," &s;aid Mental, "you are now in the very council chamber of your &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ecret committee!&mdash;You have my willing permi&s;&s;ion to in|&s;pect any paper, book, or drawer; and if the appear|ance of this place, or any thing in it, &s;ugge&s;ts any que&s;tion, even of curio&s;ity, I will as truly an&s;wer it as if I were on oath.</P>
<P>"That piece of elm, covered with black cloth, was intended to be buried with the per&s;on who&s;e name is in&s;cribed on the plate. I had &s;ome regard for her memory, and cho&s;e to have it pre&s;erved.&mdash;'Twas a &s;trange fancy, you may &s;ay&mdash;Be it &s;o.</P>
<P>"That &s;tructure of bone, on the &s;helf over it, I al&s;o kept as a memorandum&mdash;It was once the repo|&s;itory of much intelligence; and in tho&s;e &s;ockets once beamed eyes, which gli&s;tened with the dews of &s;en&s;ibility, and won the gazer's admiration ere their owner &s;poke. Yet, Sir, there was a &s;omething contained within that &s;kull, which plotted and execu|ted the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous damnation that ever bla&s;ted the tender blo&s;&s;oms of human hope!&mdash;I now gaze upon it by the hour, and wonder where the anima|ting &s;pirit of the de&s;erted cavity has fled?&mdash;We can gather no intelligence of this nature, Mr. San|dall. Science is ignorance, and genius madne&s;s, as to &s;uch information.</P>
<P>"That machine, who&s;e electrical powers have amu&s;ed me many a year, attracted for a while the powers of my rea&s;on; till, having gained a thorough

But no|thing I can read, nothing I can &s;tudy, re&s;olves me what I am!&mdash;whence I came!&mdash;or whither I &s;hall go! This perplexity, may, and I know does, trouble me more than many men. I own, too, its inutility&mdash;Yet, be the torture of doubt its puni&s;hment; and let me not incur &s;u&s;picions that I do not merit. I know no Illuminati, Mr. Sandall."</P>
<P>"Why, Sir, I&mdash;I&mdash;am &s;urpri&s;ed at&mdash;your odd ways. I&mdash;I&mdash;have no rea&s;on to doubt your good intentions&mdash;But it appears &s;trange, that a per&s;on of your &s;en&s;e&mdash;that is, it is&mdash;as I may &s;ay&mdash;it is &s;urpri&s;ing"&mdash;&s;tammered out Mr. Sandall&mdash;</P>
<P>"Spare your&s;elf, Sir," &s;aid Mental&mdash;and I will &s;pare you al&s;o; for I perceive you are not &s;uch a be|ing as a man of any &s;trength of <HI>mind ought</HI> to be of|fended with. Therefore, though you are the means of <HI>again</HI> un&s;ettling me&mdash;the bu&s;y meddler that once more drives me from a &s;pot I cho&s;e to die on&mdash;yet I, athei&s;t as you deem me, can be &s;o much a chri&s;tian as to forgive you.</P>
<P>"To you, Sir James, I owe a fuller explanation. In a few words then, Sir&mdash;I am a mi&s;erable man!&mdash;who&s;e views of happine&s;s have been almo&s;t con&s;tant|ly ob&s;cured by unexpected blights and &s;torms, ju&s;t as I thought them mine: and being of a frame and con&s;titution, perhaps, ill &s;uited to the&s;e buffetings of fortune, I find they have inflicted wounds upon my heart which have engendered a di&s;ea&s;e, who&s;e baneful influence has made me &s;eem the thing you &s;ee me&mdash;What I <HI>really</HI> am, is my own concern&mdash;But I am &s;orry that, if by word or act, I have offended you; and I know I have.</P>
<P>"You, Sir James, are happily not troubled with the mania of inquiry, and are content to take this world as you find it. I have too frequently indul|ged a petti&s;hne&s;s of mind at your expence, when I have aimed to decompo&s;e that order of things, and
<PB N="73" REF="038596_0072_10129ED0263CECD8">
&s;y&s;tem of &s;ociety, with which I am di&s;&s;atisfied. Let me, then, make you the only recompen&s;e I can, by a &s;olemn and &s;incere a&s;&s;urance, that what I have fre|quently uttered in your pre&s;ence, has been the off|&s;pring of a di&s;torted fancy&mdash;a &s;ickly heart&mdash;a feveri&s;h, giddy brain.&mdash;Let me a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, I am no wi&s;er man, becau&s;e I can detect an error in another's creed&mdash;I am no happier man, becau&s;e I laugh at others' hopes of future life and bli&s;s. No, no Sir; I know now le&s;s than when I was a boy: the learning and the &s;ciences of men have but confu&s;ed the &s;imple thoughts of nature; and as to happine&s;s&mdash;Ha!&mdash;ha!&mdash;ha!&mdash;(grinning horribly)&mdash;this world affords me no pro&s;pect of peace; and as to futurity, my doubts ob&s;cure all hope.</P>
<P>"Thus much I owed to you, Sir James; but the &s;u&s;picions of this reverend gentleman are as ground|le&s;s as they are mean, and unbecoming that faith which teaches charity!"</P>
<P>Sir James apologized. Mr. Sandall bowed, and &s;tammered; and, after examining a few empty apart|ments, they retired.</P>
<P>On their return home, the knight publi&s;hed Mr. Mental's innocence, and &s;ent a &s;ervant to his hou&s;e with the articles found in the haunted ai&s;le.</P>

<P>The narrative ran thus&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"There re&s;ided near our cottage, at Walworth, a youth of fortune, who vi&s;ited us, and became our intimate acquaintance. I &s;oon di&s;covered in him uncommon genius, and ardent feelings.</P>
<P>"This youth, with about ten or eleven others, of &s;imilar di&s;po&s;itions and talents, had formed them|&s;elves into a club, for the purpo&s;e of candid and free inquiry&mdash;I had the honor of being invited a mem|ber.</P>
<P>"My friend po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, from his fortune, a con|&s;iderable influence with the club, his patronage pro|cured me a re&s;pect I otherwi&s;e was not entitled to; and I was elected their &s;ecretary. I &s;ay nothing of our labours, which were publi&s;hed at a joint ex|pence, and circulated with a zeal beyond de&s;cription.</P>
<P>"Experience however, has taught me one truth, that every &s;tructure of morality or philo&s;ophy we

rai&s;ed upon the ruins of tho&s;e we overthrew, is un|able to &s;tand the te&s;t of practical experiment, and, are, many of them at lea&s;t, greater nui&s;ances in &s;o|ciety than tho&s;e we attempted to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>"As &s;ecretary of this &s;ociety, my hou&s;e became a &s;ort of rendezvous for its members. My Elinor and I were delighted at our good fortune in this re&s;pect, as it afforded us many hours of rational amu&s;ement in the conver&s;ation of men of ta&s;te and letters.</P>
<P>"Among others was a celebrated painter of that day. He had a per&s;on of manly beauty; a counte|nance expre&s;&s;ive of the mo&s;t tender &s;ympathies; his manners were engaging; his conver&s;e truly cap|tivating. We delighted in the company of Mr. Lin|more, and he &s;eemed to receive an equal &s;atisfaction in our's&mdash;His gratitude for the humble entertain|ment our roof afforded him was beyond all bounds. His paintings were the ornaments of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">oms, and the te&s;timonies of his favour.</P>
<P>"We pa&s;&s;ed the greater part of a year in a &s;tate the neare&s;t to bli&s;s I ever &s;aw on earth. Fortune &s;eemed determined to heap her favours on us all at once; for in the cour&s;e of this period Mr. Nutting, the grocer, died; and &s;mitten with the inju&s;tice of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the fortune which Elinor's conduct be&s;towed upon him, on his death bed made a will, by which &s;he regained her right to a property, that made us completely independent.</P>
<P>Now, mark the ficklene&s;s of fortune. Ju&s;t as the &s;un of pro&s;perity was a&s;cending the meridian, and his beams had gilded a wide and beauteous land&s;cape of enchanting hopes, a little &s;able cloud &s;prung up, and floated in a corner of the hemi&s;phere. It &s;ailed towards my dwelling. It &s;welled as it drew near; it increa&s;ed till the &s;un was hidden from my &s;ight; and then de&s;cending, bur&s;t upon my head, o'er|whelmed all pro&s;pects of the hopes I had beheld, and left me nothing to contemplate, &s;ave the fright|ful de&s;olations of de&s;pair!</P>
<P>"To dwell as little as po&s;&s;ible upon a &s;ubject that

&s;nakes every nerve with horror at its remembrance, know, then young man, that this &s;pecious morali&s;t, this zealous friend, this &s;mooth &s;peeched Linmore, proved him&s;elf a mo&s;t con&s;ummate villain.</P>
<P>"He came to our dwelling, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound Peace, In|nocence and Love, its inmates; he &s;aw as fond a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as Nature e'er de&s;igned for each other's bo&s;om. What, then, was that principle that could excite within his brea&s;t the horrid purpo&s;e, the execrable, vile de&s;ign, to mar &s;uch bli&s;s? "With the di&s;&s;em|bled vi&s;age of benevolence, he mu&s;t have borne a heart that langui&s;hed for the murder of his &s;pecies, or how could he deliberately have planned the de&s;|truction of one of Nature's noble&s;t works!</P>
<P>"You have not yet felt the influence of love; you cannot, therefore, feel like tho&s;e who have. But, if you &s;hall ever love, if all the mental energies, and all the glow of pa&s;&s;ion that con&s;titute the e&s;&s;ence of exi&s;tence in your nature, e'er center in one point, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ix on one object&mdash;you may then conceive what I ex|perienced, when, all at once, I found that object vani&s;hed.

<P>"With trembling hand I take my pen once more.&mdash;Circum&s;tances awakened in my brea&s;t a jealou&s;y of Linmore, and determined me to watch his every emotion.</P>
<P>"Start not:&mdash;my jealou&s;y was well founded&mdash;The damn'd darts of the arch fiend &s;ucceeded&mdash;Virtue was &s;ubdued, and treacherous lu&s;t tri|umphant&mdash;O! that the lightnings of heaven had bla&s;ted him or me, ere I had &s;een the &s;miling murderer!</P>
<P>"One fatal day, when having pretended a day's ab&s;ence, I concealed my&s;elf at home, I &s;aw her en|ter her chamber, and in a few minutes Linmore fol|lowed.

This was conviction; and all the powers of my rea&s;on fell beneath the impul&s;e of revenge&mdash;My hand indi&s;tinctively gra&s;ped a dagger that was near me&mdash;I ru&s;hed into the room, and, aiming a ju&s;t re|ward at the &s;educer's heart, the cur&s;ed villain &s;hrunk from my vengeance, and it fell on the poor, lo&s;t Elinor!</P>
<P>"The coward fled, and I was di&s;covered kneeling by my bleeding wife, the fatal weapon &s;till buried in her brea&s;t.</P>
<P>"In that moment of agony, I knew not what oc|curred. I was dragged by force from the body, and confined, in my own hou&s;e, under the care of &s;ome medical gentlemen.</P>
<P>"In a few days my &s;en&s;es returned, and I was able to give &s;ome account of the horrible tran&s;action; which being corroborated by the circum&s;tance of Linmore's &s;light, the coroner's jury returned a ver|dict, accidental death, and the remains of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oor Elinor were interred.</P>
<P>"Though I was not then deemed a madman, my rea&s;on had &s;u&s;tained a &s;hock it never has perfect|ly recovered.</P>
<P>"When I looked back upon the happine&s;s I had enjoyed, and gazed upon the dreadful wreck around me, my blood now chilled to ice&mdash;Now &s;lowed like burning lava through my veins&mdash;and my affrighted rea&s;on fled at the horrid view! My adoration of the object would &s;carcely allow me to believe her fal&s;e, and my love &s;eemed unaccountably increa&s;ed!</P>
<P>"She was then in her coffin&mdash;I flew to it&mdash;I threw my&s;elf in agony upon it; nor would I quit it, till my &s;trange wi&s;h was gratified, in pre&s;erving the cof|fin lid, as a memento, to be ever in my &s;ight. Another was accordingly made.</P>
<P>"After her interment, I &s;ecluded my&s;elf &s;ome months from the world. Human nature &s;uffered a degradation indeed in my e&s;timation. I grew di&s;|gu&s;ted with mankind, and with the &s;y&s;tem of the
<PB N="78" REF="038596_0077_10129EDE68B84D18">
moral government of the univer&s;e. Yet I had not then experienced more than half the mi&s;ery I have &s;ince endured.</P>
<P>"My cottage at Walworth now became frightful, every room reminded me of &s;ome happy &s;cene! and brought to mind my Elinor! They brought to me my child&mdash;O, how it chilled my blood to look at her! I thought her little eyes &s;eemed to dart reproach and vengeance on her mother's murderer&mdash;I could not bear her pre&s;ence!</P>
<P>"After &s;ome time I determined to quit not only Walworth, but England; and went to re&s;ide in America.</P>
<P>"I placed my daughter under the care of a re&s;|pectable per&s;on in the neighbourhood; made an am|ple provi&s;ion for her education; and, in ca&s;e of my death, had left her the whole of her mother's for|tune.</P>
<P>"Now, Sir, let your imagination, and your pity, follow a heart broken man to another quarter of the globe; and even there you will find, that mi&s;ery pur|&s;ued him.</P>
<P>"Scarcely was I &s;ettled in any degree of intima|cy with any one of my fellow creatures, and had be|gun to feel &s;omething like humanity reviving in my heart, when tho&s;e troubles, of which the world knows &s;o well, broke out.</P>
<P>"My friend was an American by birth, and &s;ided with Congre&s;s. My opinions, though they did not coincide with the rulers of England, yet compelled me to re&s;i&s;t the entreaties of my friend to take up arms again&s;t my mother country. I would have re|mained neuter, but that could not be; and thus, &s;oon as my heart began to cheri&s;h a love for my friend, my arm was lifted to de&s;troy him. 'Twas then I was compelled to wear and u&s;e the arms you &s;aw at my re&s;idence. But let me bury in oblivion my coun|try's &s;hame!</P>
<P>"One in&s;tance of retributive ju&s;tice I met with in America, which in &s;ome degree, reconciled me to the notion of a Providence. The villain, Linmore
<PB N="79" REF="038596_0078_10129EE19175E110">
who had made that country his refuge, was in pri&s;|on when I arrived there, implicated in a charge of murder. He was one of a party where murder en|&s;ued, in con&s;equence of an unlawful project. He was executed, and di&s;&s;ected. I offered any price for his &s;keleton, and did actually obtain the &s;kull, which you &s;aw in my clo&s;et.</P>
<P>"Di&s;gu&s;ted with the &s;cenes which pa&s;&s;ed before me, I embraced the fir&s;t opportunity of returning to England, and bought the e&s;tate of the abbey, near your uncle's.</P>
<P>"This retreat &s;uited me well. Its di&s;tance from any other dwelling, the romantic &s;cenery around it, and the gloomy walks among the abbey ruins, accor|ded well with 'my &s;oul's &s;adne&s;s.'</P>
<P>"The old woman I retained as my &s;ervant, had lived &s;ome time in the hou&s;e before I bought it.

Here I had propo&s;ed to end my days of di&s;appointment and remor&s;e.</P>
<P>"Time will not now permit me to de&s;cribe the &s;tate of my troubled mind.&mdash;Shook to its foundation was my faith in all revealed religion. I employed whole nights in the painful &s;tudy of metaphy&s;ics, with no other reward than a confirmation or increa&s;e of doubts.

<P>THE departure of Mental from the abbey was &s;oon buzzed around the country, and various &s;tories were circulated concerning him.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t curio&s;ity, or the love of &s;candal, actuated the many, George felt his heart warmly intere&s;ted in the fate of &s;o unhappy a fellow creature, and &s;igh|ed earne&s;tly for the power of alleviating his &s;orrows.</P>
<P>The tender hearted Eliza and the benevolent Mrs. Barnwell, to whom he had communicated the outlines of the melancholy tale, united in commi&s;er|ations for the &s;ufferings of a man, who&s;e life, al|mo&s;t from infancy, had been marked by di&s;appoint|ment and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>"How much is he to be pitied!" &s;aid Mrs. Barn|well:&mdash;"his heart torn with the keene&s;t &s;orrows, and his mind prevented by &s;ceptici&s;m from repo&s;ing in the con&s;olations of religion. Let his &s;tory, my dear George, teach you the value of tho&s;e truths a departed &s;aint early in&s;tilled into your mind, and never &s;uffer the &s;ubtilty of eloquence to de&s;troy tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions which chri&s;tianity has formed in your heart."</P>
<P>"How unfortunate for him," &s;aid George, "that doctrines, &s;o admirably adapted to the human heart, &s;hould have been pre&s;ented to his view in &s;o di&s;torted a &s;hape as they were by the Nuttings. It &s;urely is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;&s;uming too much, to attribute his rejection of all revelation to that circum&s;tance. Such a mind as Mental's would doubtle&s;s have received the <HI>uncorrupt|ed principles</HI> of chri&s;tianity as congenial to its wants,
<PB N="82" REF="038596_0081_10129EEA2C06B0E0">
and its expectations, and would not have remained, as at pre&s;ent, an unorganized ma&s;s of u&s;ele&s;s energies, which are attracted to one center; but, flying off at all points, rou&s;e the imagination of the mo&s;t painful doubts, and leave the heart unbenefited by their operations.</P>
<P>"Your remarks are certainly ju&s;t," replied Mrs. Barnwell; "and it affords me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure to hear &s;uch ob&s;ervations fall from a &s;on I am &s;o &s;oon to part with. In the long ab&s;ence we are to &s;uf|fer, it will be no incon&s;iderable &s;ource of plea&s;ing reflection, that you leave us with &s;uch &s;entiments.</P>
<P>"The &s;cenes, in which you are about to perform a part, my George, are of a complexion that dazzle and intoxicate the mind; and you will have occa&s;ion frequently to recur to tho&s;e principles for direction; let me hope you will ever make them your guide, and then, I am per&s;uaded, I &s;hall never blu&s;h at the mention of my &s;on."</P>
<P>Conver&s;ations of a &s;imilar nature frequently took place till the day of departure arrived, when George, with abundant proofs of the liberality of his uncle, quitted his ho&s;pitable roof, which &s;till remained the a&s;ylum of his mother and Eliza.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t time George entered the metropolis&mdash;for the fir&s;t time, breathed the fa&s;hionable air of Portland Place, where, Mr. Emery re&s;ided.</P>
<P>From the account George had received from Men|tal of the meanne&s;s and avarice of traders, he was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve the elegant appear|ance of Mr. Emery's re&s;idence. His a&s;toni&s;hment increa&s;ed, when, upon admi&s;&s;ion into the hall, he was &s;urrounded by four or five &s;tout, tall fellows in blue and &s;ilver, large bunches of flowers in their bo&s;oms, and white cambric handkerchiefs in their hands. The youth was ab&s;olutely confu&s;ed, and felt &s;ome difficulty in per&s;uading tho&s;e gentlemen of the cere|monies to procure him an audience of Mr. Emery, who was entertaining the cabinet mini&s;ters that evening at dinner, at his own table.</P>
<P>They conde&s;cended, however, at length, to &s;how
<PB N="83" REF="038596_0082_10129EED4D544AE0">
him to a parlour, where, in about an hour afterwards, Mr. Emery came to him; George having &s;ent in his name.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of the merchant of the old &s;chool George expected to meet, Mr. Emery was a man of the mo&s;t elegant deportment, dre&s;&s;ed in the extreme of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>He entered the room in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tile &s;o commanding, yet ea&s;y, that his pre&s;ence be&s;poke the mo&s;t accompli&s;h|ed manners.</P>
<P>"I am extremely concerned, Sir," &s;aid he "that very particular people are with me to day, and pre|vent my receiving you more agreeably with my wi&s;hes, and the re&s;pect due to a nephew of Sir James Barnwell. Allow me, however, to congratulate you upon your &s;afe arrival, and to introduce you to Mrs. Emery and her daughters."</P>
<P>George apologized for his appearance, and would have avoided the introduction.</P>
<P>O, by no means, &s;aid Mr. Emery, ringing&mdash;In what part of the hou&s;e is your mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid he to the &s;ervant who appeared.</P>
<P>The ladies have drove down to the pavilion this morning, Sir; and do not return till to-morrow.</P>
<P>That's unfortunate, indeed: but you will ex|cu&s;e me, I'm &s;ure; we &s;hall be better acquainted &s;oon, and apologies will become unnece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;William, &s;erve dinner in this room to my friend Mr. Barnwell, and tell the butler to bring what wine he orders.</P>
<P>With a cordial &s;hake of the hand, Mr. Emery left his young friend to a &s;oliloquy, full of wonder, at the &s;cenes before him. The manner in which he was received a&s;toni&s;hed him:&mdash;Cabinet mini&s;ters dining with a merchant&mdash;was a novelty to him; but more &s;trange than every thing el&s;e, appeared to him the idea of a man's not knowing whether his wife and daughters were at home, or in the country.</P>
<P>A profu&s;e dinner was &s;erved up, con&s;i&s;ting of every delicacy that the &s;ea&s;on afforded, and in a &s;tile of legance beyond all George had ever &s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="038596_0083_10129EF069362FA8">
It was near ten o'clock when he had fini&s;hed his &s;umptuous dinner; and about eleven, he was think|ing of retiring to re&s;t, when Mr. Emery entered, introducing a young man, apparently about twenty, of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> countenance and delicate frame.</P>
<P>"Mr. Barnwell," &s;aid he, "this is a pupil of mine. Mr. Rigby, let me recommend Mr. Barn|well to your friend&s;hip: I have mentioned him to you before."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall be very proud of rendering you any &s;er|vice, Sir," &s;aid Mr. Rigby.</P>
<P>Mr. Emery retired, calling to the &s;ervants in the hall&mdash;"The chariot in a quarter of an hour."</P>
<P>The pupils were left together. What a contra&s;t did they form! George's cheeks glowed with health&mdash;Rigby's were &s;unk, and pale; George's form and and limbs proclaimed the temperance and exerci&s;e he u&s;ed&mdash;Rigby's &s;lender legs and &s;hrivelled arms as plainly declared a life of &s;loth and intemperance. The dre&s;s of the former was &s;imple and manly&mdash;that of the latter, di&s;gu&s;tingly effeminate: his whole appearance prejudiced George again&s;t him, whil&s;t he in return con&s;idered George as a boor.</P>
<P>&mdash;"The chariot in a quarter of an hour" was echoed three or four times in the hall.</P>
<P>George could not refrain from a&s;king whether any thing particular drew Mr. Emery abroad &s;o late.</P>
<P>"So late!&mdash;Eh, demme!&mdash;that's neat&mdash;Excu&s;ez moi&mdash;Upon my &s;oul I can't help laughing!"&mdash;which laughing was merely a hectic barking. Why, my dear fellow, you mu&s;t be very raw&mdash;very green, indeed!&mdash;excu&s;ez&mdash;moi&mdash;its not eleven!"&mdash;whirling a gold watch round by the chain&mdash;"The Principal's only going his u&s;ual round."</P>
<P>"May I be &s;o free as to inquire, what you mean by that phra&s;e, Mr. Rigby?&mdash;I believe you know I am a &s;tranger in London."</P>
<P>"O yes&mdash;excu&s;ez moi&mdash;that's plain enough! However, one &s;hould not be too &s;evere&mdash;I remem|ber when I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;was as great a quiz&mdash;excu&s;ez

<P>"You are very happy at a de&s;cription, Mr. Rig|by," &s;aid George:&mdash;"a little ad libitum in the co|lours though, I pre&s;ume."</P>
<P>"No, demme, not I&mdash;I'm a plain matter of fact, ab&s;olutely. But what are you going to do with your&s;elf till bed-time?"</P>
<P>"That time is come with me, Sir, for I am fa|tigued."</P>

<P>George &s;miled; Mr. Rigby &s;uppo&s;ed, at his wit: it was, in fact, at his folly.</P>
<P>How wide a field for reflection did the incidents of the la&s;t few hours open to a mind like George's, ever active and di&s;cerning, and&mdash;"never le&s;s alone, than when alone."</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FROM the &s;pecimens he had &s;een on the day of his arrival, George was prepared to expect a very
<PB N="86" REF="038596_0085_10129EF60F4EFDB8">
different &s;tyle of living, from that which he had an|ticipated in the country, and &s;uch was the reality.</P>
<P>He was e&s;tabli&s;hed in Mr. Emery's hou&s;e in the capa|city rather of a private &s;ecretary than a clerk. In&s;tead of being confined from an early hour in the morn|ing till late at night, in po&s;ting ledgers, and copying invoices, as Sir James had taught him to expect, and as was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ca&s;e with all merchants' clerks when Sir James was in trade, George found that the &s;ons, or nephews, or cou&s;ins of merchants, who threw a capital into the firm, under-went no &s;uch drudgery, which is con&s;igned to boys who had learnt to write fine hands at charity &s;chools.</P>
<P>About eleven o'clock George u&s;ually went from Portland Place to the 'compting-hou&s;e, Broad Street Buildings, where Mr. Drudge, the <HI>fagging</HI> partner, re&s;ided. Any communications of con&s;equence, betwixt Mr. Emery and Mr. Drudge, were convey|ed by George; as well as papers that required the &s;ignature of the former, who &s;eldom vi&s;ited the count|ing hou&s;e him&s;elf.</P>
<P>From Broad Street Buildings to Bat&s;on's coffee|hou&s;e was a regular one o'clock walk for George, where he met the rich Jew brokers, and made Mr. Emery's propo&s;als for the barter of bullion, con&s;ols, omnium, or lottery, according to previous in&s;truc|tions; which, from his intimacy with mini&s;ters, gave generally the tone to the market.</P>
<P>At three he paraded the Royal Exchange, and in|vited the foreign merchants to dine in Portland Place, which completed the labours of the day; ex|cept upon particular occa&s;ions, when letters of con|fidence were to be copied, or memorials for con|tracts &s;ent to the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>Such a &s;lender portion of employ, left void a large &s;pace of time for his own inclination to fill up.</P>
<P>It being but the commencement of the &s;ea&s;on, Mrs. Emery and her daughters were &s;eldom in town; and Mr. Emery was &s;carcely vi&s;ible in his own hou&s;e, except at a few dinners, &s;urrounded by company.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="038596_0086_10129EF93743A0F8">
Mr. Rigby, in addition to an extreme oppo&s;ition of ta&s;te and pur&s;uits, had the motives of jealou&s;y and envy to render George di&s;gu&s;tful to him; and there|fore, beyond the ceremonials of occa&s;ional meetings, they never &s;poke to each other.</P>
<P>Thus lei&s;ure, for a con&s;iderable time, was al&s;o &s;ol|itude to George, who had refu&s;ed &s;everal invitations to vi&s;its, for the vulgar rea&s;on of not liking the party.</P>
<P>A well &s;tored library was his u&s;ual lounge after din|ner, and in the evening he amu&s;ed him&s;elf with mu|&s;ic, or drawing; in a familiar corre&s;pondence with his &s;i&s;ter; and occa&s;ionally in attempts at poetry, of which he was fond to exce&s;s.</P>
<P>The library of Mr. Emery compri&s;ed an a&s;&s;emblage of literature in all its branches, and the privilege of acce&s;s to &s;uch a &s;tore was, perhaps, the greate&s;t happine&s;s George had ever experienced.</P>
<P>Having, one afternoon, fini&s;hed reading Dr. Gre|gory's life of the unfortunate Chatterton, he was de|tected in tears by the &s;ervant who brought him his tea and the evening papers.</P>
<P>George ha&s;tily &s;natched up the new&s;paper, to conceal his emotion, and ca&s;t his eyes rapidly over its contents.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t his heart beat indignant at the fate of Chat|terton, a paragraph pre&s;ented it&s;elf, in which the enormous &s;ums paid in one &s;ea&s;on to Didelot and his wife for dancing at the opera were enumerated.</P>
<P>"Good God!" exclaimed he, when left to him|&s;elf, "how &s;mall a portion of this wealth might have &s;aved to England, and to the world, another Milton!"</P>
<P>His ardent mind pur&s;ued the melancholy thought, and he penned the following &s;onnet:</P>

<P>Such were his pur&s;uits, &s;uch his propen&s;ities; a conduct &s;o different from other young men of his age, was the &s;ource of ridicule all over the hou&s;e.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NEW &s;cenes now opened. The reign of di&s;&s;ipa|tion commenced for the &s;ea&s;on by the arrival of Mrs. Emery and her daughters. George was introduced by Mr. Emery. "Lord, child," &s;aid Mrs. Emery, "you can't think how exce&s;&s;ively I've been longing to &s;ee you, ever &s;ince I knew of your arrival. Well, how do you like London? Is not it delightfully charming! Don't you think your&s;elf tran&s;ported to Paradi&s;e? What do you think of the theatres? Which do you like be&s;t, Drury Lane, or Covent Garden? Have you &s;een Pari&s;ot? Have you heard the Banti?"</P>
<P>George was never &s;o confu&s;ed in his life, as at the abrupt volubility of this lady. He was thinking how to reply to her &s;tring of que&s;tions, when all of a &s;udden, &s;he exclaimed&mdash;"O, pray do me the favour to write a note to the Counte&s;s of Codrington, to &s;ay we are come to town, and mean to be at the opera to night; and do me the favour to write to the Duch|e&s;s of&mdash;O, no&mdash;now I think of it, it will be quite delightful to take them all by &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;and I'll po&s;itively frighten them all out of their &s;en&s;es. Come, Emma&mdash;Come, Charlotte, looking at her watch, "we have ju&s;t time enough to drive round the &s;quares before we dre&s;s;" and away they flew, leav|ing George in a &s;tate of perfect a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>At dinner he &s;aw them again, and more particu|larly &s;urveyed the Mi&s;s Emerys. They were mere fa&s;hionables; their countenances rather pretty than hand&s;ome, without any traces of intelligence or &s;en|&s;ibility. The younge&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed mo&s;t vivacity, and
<PB N="90" REF="038596_0089_10129F01F58BBF98">
the elde&s;t more &s;en&s;e; the former loved laughter, but the delight of the latter was &s;candal.</P>
<P>As they were reputed fortunes, they were not without admirers, whom they both kept in that doubting &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage, &s;o plea&s;ing to the vanity of the giddy part of the fair &s;ex, but at which a wo|man of virtue and under&s;tanding revolts.</P>
<P>By the attention of Lord Morley to Mi&s;s Emery, and the Rev. Mr. Ea&s;twood to Mi&s;s Charlotte, George ea&s;ily di&s;covered the favourites of the day.</P>
<P>The hour for the opera arrived; the carriages were ordered; each of the favoured lovers handed his idol to his own chariot, whil&s;t Mr. Emery's was re&s;erved for Mrs. Emery and her new friend, George, of whom &s;he affected to be extravagantly fond! and kindly undertook to lead him through all the mazes of the high world.</P>
<P>When they entered the magnificent &s;tructure of the opera hou&s;e, which was extremely crouded, George was ab&s;olutely overcome by the &s;trength of the new impre&s;&s;ions which &s;o &s;udden a blaze of &s;plendor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">reated.</P>
<P>The opera was over, and the overtures of the bal|let was performing. Upon a mind ta&s;teful by na|ture, and uncommonly &s;u&s;ceptible, charms of mu&s;ic were not lo&s;t. While every one el&s;e had &s;eated them&s;elves in the box, and were bu&s;ily employed in nodding round the brilliant circle, exchanging looks of &s;miling affability, and at the &s;ame moment whi&s;pering mutual calumnies, George &s;tood ab&s;orbed in exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations. A tittering &s;ort of laugh arou&s;ed him, and he found he had been the laughing &s;tock of the party.</P>
<P>"In the name of wonder," cried Lord Morley, "what have you found &s;o petrifying?"</P>
<P>"Why, child," &s;aid Mrs. Emery, "you have u&s;ed an attitude in the wrong place. Nobody ever li&s;|tens to the overtures; and as to being a&s;toni&s;hed, you mu&s;t remember its the vulgare&s;t thing in the world to be &s;urpri&s;ed at any thing one &s;ees!"</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="038596_0090_10129F038E2F0310">
"Po&s;&s;ibly," &s;aid Mr. Ea&s;twood, "this is Mr. Barnwell's fir&s;t appearance in this character."</P>
<P>George a&s;&s;ented.</P>
<P>"O, mon&s;trous!" &s;creamed Mrs. Emery. "Thou brute!&mdash;A month in London and not one night at the opera! How can you have po&s;&s;ibly amu&s;ed your|&s;elf?" &s;aid Lord Morley. "Have tragedy and com|edy entirely engro&s;&s;ed you?"</P>
<P>He had not &s;een either.</P>
<P>"Mercy on me," exclaimed Mrs. Emery, "what a ta&s;k have I undertaken!&mdash;<HI>Mon petit enfant,</HI> come, tell your mama what you really have &s;een, and what you really do know."</P>
<P>Such was the trifling that prevented George from paying any attention to the mu&s;ic or dancers.</P>
<P>For what purpo&s;e do &s;o many per&s;ons a&s;&s;emble here? thought he. The entertainments of the orche&s;tra or &s;tage might certainly as well be altoge|ther omitted, as &s;o &s;lightly attended to. All that he had been permitted to &s;ee or hear, only &s;erved to excite his curio&s;ity, and determined him to take an early opportunity of vi&s;iting the theatre alone.</P>
<P>As they were leaving their box&mdash;"I mu&s;t relin|qui&s;h going to the Duche&s;s's delightful party to night," &s;aid Mrs. Emery, "or di&s;mi&s;s my <HI>noviciate;</HI> for po&s;itively, George, you would di&s;grace me. Be&s;ides nobody knows you. I &s;hould have imagined Mr. Emery might, at lea&s;t, have introduced you to a few fa&s;hionables. But he is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the mini&s;ters. Do you think they'll give him a coronet, my Lord?" turning to Lord Morley.</P>
<P>"I know they can refu&s;e him nothing," &s;aid Lord Morley.</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Mrs. Emery, after a pau&s;e, "I &s;hall certainly di&s;mi&s;s you, George. And merely for your &s;ake, I'll po&s;itively give a route on Thur&s;day, (though its abominable early in the &s;ea&s;on) a&s;k all the world, and introduce you my&s;elf to every body. So, go&mdash;go your ways."&mdash;George parried the&s;e blows very well; for, though unlearnt in the fa&s;hionable jargon
<PB N="92" REF="038596_0091_10129F08F9CC8240">
of the beau monde, he was wanting neither in gen|teel deportment, or even an elegant and agreeable manner of expre&s;&s;ing his ideas, which were &s;uperior, beyond all compari&s;on, to the united efforts of his party.</P>
<P>As he was making his bow to Mrs. Emery, at the chariot door, three gentlemen, walking abrea&s;t, pu&s;hed the &s;oldiers on one &s;ide, and were pa&s;&s;ing on, when Mrs. Emery's carriage attracted their no|tice, and they &s;topped to pay their re&s;pects:&mdash;"O Middleton," &s;aid the lady, "are you here?"</P>
<P>"We've ju&s;t looked in," &s;aid a florid face man, with an amazing large cocked hat, and an in&s;olent air:&mdash;"but, who the devil's that Quiz?" in a whi&s;|per.</P>
<P>"A very particular friend of Mr. Emery's ju&s;t e&s;caped from rural fetters. Have a little compa&s;&s;ion on him, for our &s;akes. George," continued &s;he, "this is Captain Middleton; he wi&s;hes the plea&s;ure of your acquaintance?" and the carriage whirled off.</P>
<P>George now found him&s;elf in a new &s;ociety. Captain Middleton took his arm in as familiar a &s;tyle as if they were old acquaintances, and began a &s;ort of catechi&s;m, and &s;oon di&s;covered his own mo&s;t libertine principles, and proved to him the un&s;ullied mind of his new acquaintance.</P>
<P>It was a dark night, and began to rain; a hack|ney coach was called, and orders given to drive to St. James's Street. They alighted at a coffee hou&s;e; and George, having acknowledged that he had no engagement, felt compelled to &s;it down with them to &s;upper. Wine was quaffed in goblets, laughter expelled thought, and was kept up by a continued &s;eries of ob&s;cene merriment.</P>
<P>Unaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch &s;cenes, George performed his part but indifferently. It was the fir&s;t time in his life he had ever li&s;tened to an unbridled ridicule of religion and morality. Religion was ab&s;olutely &s;couted; and as to what was, or was not morality, it was &s;o indefinable to the comprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e wits, that according to their &s;y&s;tem, a man of liberal
<PB N="93" REF="038596_0092_10129F0A906AED38">
ideas had no other guide for his conduct than his own convenience.</P>
<P>As the wine circulated through their veins, their &s;tories gained a richer colouring, and their principles became more naked.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation was placed a youth of &s;eventeen, who&s;e heart had hitherto ever beat in uni&s;on with rea&s;on. It had known no irregular de&s;ires; had never felt the fire of lu&s;t, or cheri&s;hed any inclina|tion un&s;anctioned by his head. Yet was his heart not &s;toic; it was open, generous; glowing with good will to all around him. Thence &s;prung that gene|ral wi&s;h, &s;o fatal in its effects, to accommodate his conduct to his company&mdash;<HI>to do as others do.</HI> To re|fu&s;e a gla&s;s, is frequently to refu&s;e a toa&s;t; and to refu&s;e &s;ome toa&s;ts, would &s;o impeach a man's prin|ciples, that he would be for ever after pointed at as a mon&s;ter of virtue!</P>
<P>George was too good natured to refu&s;e his wine, and too unaccu&s;tomed to its effects to keep pace with his companions. The con&s;equences were, in&s;en&s;ibil|ity for the night, and a mo&s;t inveterate head-ach in the morning, with reflections more painful to his mind than any he had hitherto experienced.</P>

<P>EVERY &s;ucceeding day now brought with it &s;ome novelty. The route at Mrs. Emery's was as &s;plendid as any in London, and as crouded as her ambition could de&s;ire.</P>
<P>At this route George was introduced to a numerous ho&s;t of per&s;onages, male and female; and their va|rious titles, names, and de&s;criptions, danced in his
<PB N="94" REF="038596_0093_10129F0D676AAAF0">
brain the whole night: yet among&s;t them all there was but one for who&s;e further acquaintance he felt the lea&s;t inclination.</P>
<P>A very genteel young man, in mourning, who with his two &s;i&s;ters were introduced under the names of Mr. and the Mi&s;s Lambtons&punc; had left a very fa|vourable impre&s;&s;ion upon his mind.</P>
<P>His manners would have pa&s;&s;ed, with many, as proudly forbidding; but George, with more di&s;|cernment, &s;aw in them the effects of a dignified re|&s;erve.</P>
<P>His conver&s;ation was elegant, and rational. He appeared to po&s;&s;e&s;s a con&s;iderable knowledge of the world, and to be familiar with the etiquette of the higher circles.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;s Lambtons were plea&s;ing and intelligent young women.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed an hour in delightful conver&s;e with Mr. Lambton, George felt extremely concerned at his departure; and the more &s;o, as not the mo&s;t di&s;|tant hint of a &s;econd meeting fell from his lips.</P>
<P>Upon inquiring, he learned from Mrs. Emery, that this gentleman was the &s;on of a decea&s;ed Welch &s;quire, who had left his children the fame of a libe|ral ho&s;pitality, in return for having frittered away, almo&s;t to nothing, his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Mr. Lambton was &s;tudying the law; and his &s;i&s;|ters, who had ju&s;t arrived from Wales, at pre&s;ent re&s;ided with him in town, and were entirely depen|dent upon his genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>George &s;ighed to think, that the only individual he had met with in London, who&s;e friend&s;hip he &s;hould wi&s;h to cultivate, he might in all probability never behold again.</P>
<P>He was agreeably di&s;appointed. A few days af|ter the route there was a ma&s;querade at the opera hou&s;e. Mrs. Emery had engaged George to accom|pany her, and a party was accordingly formed.</P>
<P>They had &s;carcely entered the room, when a black domino, with two females under his care, advanced
<PB N="95" REF="038596_0094_10129F0F00014820">
Mrs. Emery, with her u&s;ual volubility, was trying the patience of George ju&s;t as this party pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"I have heard that voice before," &s;aid the black domino, to his companions.</P>
<P>George in&s;tantly recollected Mr. Lambton's voice, which was confirmed by the reply of his &s;i&s;ters. Noti|cing carefully his dre&s;s, he determined, if fate re|lieved him of his patrone&s;s, to make him&s;elf known.</P>
<P>Lord Morley and Mi&s;s Emery came running out of breath, to acquaint them that there was a mo&s;t &s;ingular character at the other end of the room.</P>
<P>Mr. Ea&s;twood and Mi&s;s Charlotte Emery arrived with a confirmation of the &s;ame intelligence. At the &s;ame in&s;tant Captain Middleton appeared, and Mrs. Emery taking hold of his arm, relinqui&s;hing George's, he made his e&s;cape, and went in pur&s;uit of Mr. Lambton. In a few minutes he di&s;covered him; and walking a &s;mall di&s;tance behind him, li&s;tened to his voice again, that he might be confirm|ed in his opinion.</P>
<P>"Well, then, my girls," &s;aid Lambton, for 'twas he, "ma&s;querades will not be among the number of tho&s;e indulgencies you may &s;igh to think a parent's indi&s;cretions have deprived you of. What but in|anity of mind can find plea&s;ure in a &s;cene like this? Are you not already tired with it?"</P>
<P>George was now convinced; and walking up to him, re&s;pectfully &s;aid&mdash;"Am I mi&s;taken&mdash;or have I the plea&s;ure of addre&s;&s;ing Mr. Lambton?"</P>
<P>"My name is Lambton, Sir; but I have to learn that of the per&s;on who honors me with his notice."</P>
<P>"Barnwell," replied George, unma&s;king.</P>
<P>Lambton bowed, and pre&s;ented his &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t ab&s;olutely offer a &s;acrifice to chance for this unexpected good fortune," &s;aid Barnwell. "I think it &s;o long &s;ince I had the plea&s;ure of your conver&s;ation, that I began to de&s;pair of its renewal."</P>
<P>"Do you expect me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">reply &s;incerely, or fa&s;h|ionably, to &s;o hand&s;ome a compliment?" &s;aid Lamb|ton.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="038596_0095_10129F1333B7BB18">
"That will depend, I apprehend upon your own opinion, of which I am mo&s;t likely to be plea&s;ed with; though, if my own a&s;&s;ertion will pa&s;s for any thing, I prefer &s;incerity, and yet de&s;ire to receive no greater than I be&s;tow."</P>
<P>"Am I to under&s;tand then, that re&s;iding with the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable Commoners, in the metropolis, with the mo&s;t ea&s;y acce&s;s to every amu&s;ement it af|fords, you can find lei&s;ure and inclination for &s;o dull an employment as conver&s;ation?"</P>
<P>"I am happy to find you do not judge of me per|&s;onally, but relatively."</P>
<P>A pau&s;e en&s;ued.</P>
<P>"I am &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o few characters," &s;aid George.</P>
<P>I am rather &s;urpri&s;ed at the contra&s;t for the real and a&s;&s;umed character of the metamorpho&s;es we have. What, for in&s;tance, &s;hould you &s;uppo&s;e was the real character of that prim Quaker!&mdash;The dre&s;s of puri|ty conceals one of the mo&s;t celebrated votaries of impure plea&s;ure in this city. With the imbecility of accelerated old age is combined the folly and di&s;|&s;ipation of youth.</P>
<P>He has the di&s;po&s;al of immen&s;e wealth, which he lavi&s;hes upon the lowe&s;t objects of pollution; yet, to di&s;charge a ju&s;t debt is painful to him.</P>
<P>He di&s;graces the patrician order, by having been born to a dukedom; nay, he le&s;&s;ens the dignity of human nature, by &s;hewing that the &s;pirit of a Satyr may animate the re&s;emblance of a man.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;erable old man!" cried George.</P>
<P>And yet, ob&s;erve how his company is &s;ought af|ter. His riches procure him the attention of a train of para&s;ites, who&s;e prai&s;e is infamy, but which he, poor man, gratefully receives, as the only &s;ub&s;titute for tho&s;e plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations, which play about the heart where virtue is re&s;pected.</P>
<P>That fine form in the ve&s;t of a Nun, who &s;eems &s;o de&s;irous of attracting the Quaker's attention, is one of the wilde&s;t daughters of fa&s;hionable levity,
<PB N="97" REF="038596_0096_10129F174A2555F8">
Her parents are re&s;pectable and opulent citizens; but Matilda unfortunately has an aunt, who is a widow of quality, with whom &s;he re&s;ides at a di&s;tance from parental ob&s;ervation. If &s;he has not yet ab&s;olutely bartered virtue for plea&s;ure, &s;he cannot ju&s;tly be &s;urpri&s;ed that the world has already attached that infamy to her character, which &s;he &s;o &s;edulou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly courts.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve, that if &s;he fails in obtaining the notice of the Cyprian Quaker, which would be the climax of notoriety, that &s;he will attack at lea&s;t half the young men in the room, be familiar with each, and tells them all, that &s;he perfectly de&s;pi&s;es the la&s;t &s;he flirted with.</P>
<P>"How much to be pitied!" &s;aid George.</P>
<P>How much more to be blamed! replied Lamb|ton: for, though we make every allowance for an improper education, what can palliate &s;uch a con|temptible thir&s;t for admiration. Her errors are not the offspring of nature, but a mean and di&s;gu&s;ting &s;elf-vanity, which impeaches her heart as well as her under&s;tanding. I can admit the volatility of youthful blood as an excu&s;e for vivacity; but where that is natural, it never permits a di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>Matilda is a mi&s;tre&s;s of cunning, and to obtain notoriety, would &s;acrifice the feelings of half man|kind.</P>
<P>It would be a ta&s;k for the night to enumerate the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he has occa&s;ioned in various families the di&s;cord &s;he has fomented betwixt friends and lovers. But &s;ee, &s;he has relinqui&s;hed the Quaker in de&s;pair, and is cro&s;&s;ing her&s;elf in the attitude of &s;upplication before a Monk.</P>
<P>"And does your information extend to a know|ledge of his reality?"</P>
<P>"He is the &s;on of a courtier; a young man who&s;e acquaintance is covetted by &s;uch as prefer a warm and luxurious de&s;cription of ob&s;cene incidents to ra|tional conver&s;ation. He has travelled, and will re|count to you the intrigues of convents in &s;uch glow|ing

language, as delights the depraved ta&s;te of &s;uch of his company as would be fatigued to death with any thing intellectual. I believe, in general, his &s;tories are credited; but for my own part I cannot help a little &s;ceptici&s;m, that makes me revolt at nar|rations &s;o full of the marvellous. In fact, I have heard well informed people &s;ay, that in the company of men of &s;en&s;e, he will him&s;elf laugh at the cre|dulity and fal&s;e ta&s;te of his dupes."</P>
<P>"Do you ob&s;erve a very well &s;u&s;tained re&s;emblance of the Tragic Mu&s;e?" &s;aid George.</P>
<P>"It is an exception to my former remark," repli|ed Lambton;&mdash;"and is &s;upported by an amiable woman, as melancholy at all &s;ea&s;ons as &s;he now appears. Her fate excites the &s;ympathy of all who are &s;u&s;ceptible of pitty. With an admirable mind, and beauteous form, Fortune had al&s;o be&s;towed up|on her riches and independence.</P>

&s;mall degree heightened by the painful reflection, that they are attributed to her own fatal error."</P>
<P>"How much I am obliged by your communica|tions," &s;aid George, "and how much would my di&s;|like to London, and its <HI>Harlequinades</HI> be &s;oftened, could I have recour&s;e to the intelligence of &s;uch a mind. Why are the terms friend, and friend&s;hip, become &s;o ridiculou&s;ly unmeaning," continued George, "that, whil&s;t one's heart is prompted to confe&s;s its attachment, the force of ridicule repels the generous in&s;tinct?"</P>
<P>"But for this, Mr. Lambton, I would not he&s;itate to a&s;k a probation of my profe&s;&s;ions; and am not without hope that I &s;hould obtain your regard."</P>
<P>"Its well the party you have left do not overhear you," &s;aid Lambton. "Had Captain Middleton heard &s;uch a &s;entimental &s;peech, you would never have been admitted into any of his parties; and the rejection would have marked you for a milk-&s;op all the re&s;t of your life."</P>
<P>"Would to God he had been here, then," cried George.</P>
<P>"Softly, young man," &s;aid Lambton; "you are not &s;ufficiently aware of the evil you &s;o bravely &s;purn. Could you be content to be &s;neered at by the men, and laughed at by the women of your acquaintance?"</P>
<P>"Would <HI>all</HI> my acquaintance," &s;aid George, arch|ly, "act &s;o ab&s;urdly?"</P>
<P>"I perceive your allu&s;ion," &s;aid Lambton, &s;miling, "but you are too young for a philo&s;opher&mdash;What comes here?" continued he.</P>
<P>A ma&s;k now approached, followed by a crowd, which his &s;trange dre&s;s, and &s;till more &s;trange beha|viour attracted.&mdash;He appeared as a Hermit.</P>
<P>"Does any one know him?&mdash;Does any one know him! was buzzed about the room.</P>
<P>Captain Middleton, Mrs. Emery and her daugh|ters, with Lord Morley and Mr. Ea&s;twood, were among the followers of the Hermit.</P>
<P>"The man &s;hould certainly be confined," &s;aid
<PB N="100" REF="038596_0099_10129F202E1DF438">
Captain Middleton: he mu&s;t ab&s;olutely be mad."</P>
<P>"Somebody had better take care of him," cried Mrs. Emery; "he may commit &s;ome mi&s;chief."</P>
<P>"Its exce&s;&s;ively unplea&s;ant to be &s;o bored with his &s;ermons," &s;aid Lord Morley.</P>
<P>"In&s;ects, away!" cried the Hermit, in a voice which George immediately recollected to be Men|tal's. "In&s;ects, away!&mdash;Ye flies of fa&s;hion!&mdash;Ye fluttering nothings!&mdash;Devoid of thought&mdash;caprice impels, or folly leads your &s;teps. Leave me&mdash;leave me to my own reflections&mdash;Aye&mdash;Can you laugh!&mdash;Grin on&mdash;'tis Levity's meridian now, and this the paradi&s;e of Folly!

<P>"Lord!" cried Charlotte Emery, "let's leave him:&mdash;one had as well be obliged to li&s;ten to the man that preaches to the Jews."</P>
<P>"True, my &s;weet girl," &s;aid the Rev. Mr. Ea&s;t|wood. "Morality is certainly very nece&s;&s;ary in the world; but there are times for all things: be&s;ides, one may contrive means to acquaint people with their duty, without a breach of good manners."</P>
<P>George had &s;tood &s;ilently ob&s;erving what pa&s;&s;ed; but when Mental and the crowd had pa&s;&s;ed him, he could not help exclaiming&mdash;</P>
<P>"Good heavens! the la&s;t man in the world I &s;hould have expected to meet at a ma&s;querade!"</P>
<P>"Do you know him, then?" &s;aid Lambton.</P>
<P>George briefly related the outlines of his &s;tory, which, with the remarks of Lambton on the tale, occupied the remainder of the time till they &s;epara|ted; when, to the great plea&s;ure of George, Mr.

<P>SEVERAL weeks pa&s;&s;ed away unmarked by any event of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Mental never appeared, though, &s;ince the night of the ma&s;querade, George con&s;tantly expected him.</P>
<P>New <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of bu&s;ine&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> amu&s;ement, &s;ucceeded each other &s;o rapidly, as to leave little room for re|flection, or little lei&s;ure for the conver&s;ations of Lamb|ton, which were the &s;ource of con&s;iderable improve|ment, and real delight.</P>
<P>Imperceptibly his mind became moulded into a compliance with fa&s;hionable life, and his manners a&s;&s;imilated to its modes; yet &s;till the native purity of his principles remained un&s;haken: honour &s;till glowed in his brea&s;t, and &s;incerity dwelt on his tongue.</P>
<P>He had now pa&s;&s;ed his &s;eventeenth year, though the expre&s;&s;ion of his features, and his manly per&s;on, made him appear con&s;iderably older.</P>
<P>About this time Mr. Freeman wrote Mr. Emery intelligence of his intention to comply with his re|que&s;t, and permit his daughter to vi&s;it the metropo|lis; and added, that he meant him&s;elf to accompa|ny her to town.</P>
<P>The agitation of Mr. Emery at this intelligence &s;urpri&s;ed George extremely. Unea&s;ine&s;s of mind became evident in every tran&s;action. He would order the chariot, and forget his orders <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he would
<PB N="102" REF="038596_0101_10129F24A0DB2200">
employ George to copy &s;tatements of accounts, which he would alter as frequently as if it depended upon his fancy to arrange the figures.</P>
<P>Mr. Drudge, the acting partner, was clo&s;eted with him for hours together. Letters after letters were di&s;patched to the Trea&s;ury; and anxiety was expre&s;&s;ed in his looks, words, and actions.</P>
<P>At length Mr. Freeman and his daughter arrived. The latter was a beautiful girl, about the age of &s;eventeen.</P>
<P>George, who happened to be with Mr. Emery when their chai&s;e &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pt at his door, was &s;truck with his exclamation, as he went to receive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> them&mdash;"He's here, by G&mdash;! Then there's nothing for it but deception!"</P>
<P>In a moment the chagrin of his countenance was half concealed by an hypocritical &s;mile of welcome.</P>
<P>"Well," cried Mr. Freeman, as he &s;tumped through the hall, leaning on a gold headed cane "Well, Ma&s;ter Emery, here am I, once more, in London. Upon my con&s;cience, but you've an elegant hou&s;e here. Aye, and here are my old ac|quaintances, Emma and Charlotte. Why, they are grown out of mind; and &s;o fine too&mdash;why, Maria," to his daughter "our country clothes will make our fa&s;hionable friends here blu&s;h for us. Where is my ward, Georgina? and where is young Barn|well?"</P>
<P>Congratulations and embraces now took place; and about &s;ix o'clock the &s;ervant announced dinner.</P>
<P>"Dinner!" exclaimed Mr. Freeman: "by my credit, but I'm &s;hocked! What have you not din|ed! Well, well&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e its the fa&s;hion."</P>
<P>By de&s;ign, Mr. Emery had no party that day. As they were at dinner&mdash;"And, pray, how go things now in London. Have &s;ugars advanced as much as was expected?"</P>
<P>"Sir,&mdash;Eh&mdash;&s;ugars&mdash;" cried Emery, and looked &s;ignificantly at George.</P>
<P>George an&s;wered the que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="038596_0102_10129F26936CD2F8">
Mr. Emery, fearful of more que&s;tions, began talk|ing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Have you heard how many millions Mr. Pitt wants?"</P>
<P>"No," replied Mr. Freeman; "nor I don't care."</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon," &s;aid Emery; "but it will make &s;ome material difference to us, that I happened <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o know to a certainty. The turn of the market hangs on that point."</P>
<P>"What market?" &s;aid Mr. Freeman.</P>
<P>Mr. Emery appeared confu&s;ed.</P>
<P>"I mean," &s;aid he, "the funds. You are aware, that during the war, part of our capital would lie dead, were it not for the opportunities offered by loans.</P>
<P>"Why, truly," &s;aid Mr. Freeman, "loans, or tho&s;e things, I don't know much about. Merchan|dize in my younger days, con&s;i&s;ted in imports and exports; a good cargo outwards, or homewards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and I can't &s;ay I much like the new &s;ort of mer|chandize, where the freight is invi&s;ible, and the bills of exchange are abundant. Not but, in my time, if the &s;tate &s;tood in need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the merchants of London could advance their ca&s;h at fair intere&s;t; but they never made the di&s;tre&s;s of their country the means of their profit, or degraded the character of an Engli&s;h merchant into that of a money lender!"</P>
<P>"But you mu&s;t con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ider the difference of the times, Sir," &s;aid Emery. "Things are much altered &s;ince then."</P>
<P>"I'm afraid they are," &s;aid Mr. Freeman em|phatically.</P>
<P>After dinner Mr. Freeman, Mr. Emery, and George, were left to them&s;elves. Mr. Emery drank gla&s;s after gla&s;s till he &s;eemed to have conquered his feelings, and George thought proper to leave them together.</P>
<P>They &s;oon, however, joined the ladies in the draw|ing room, and were &s;carcely &s;eated, when Lord Morley was announced.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="038596_0103_10129F2AA7E0D8D8">
"Lord who?" cried Mr. Freeman. "Why, you did not &s;ay you expected any Lords."</P>
<P>"O dear, Sir," &s;aid Mrs. Emery, "they tire us to death with their freedom."</P>
<P>"Either, then, the dignity of a nobleman is di|mini&s;hed, or the con&s;equence of Ma&s;ter Emery con|&s;iderably advanced," &s;aid Mr. Freeman.</P>
<P>A hectic cough introduced his lord&s;hip. My dear creatures," cried he, entering, "am I the fir&s;t to give you joy&mdash;have you heard it&mdash;Eh&mdash;But I beg par|don, I did not ob&s;erve&mdash;"</P>
<P>Mr. Freeman was introduced.</P>
<P>"What's the news, you tire&s;ome creature?" &s;aid Mi&s;s Emery. "How can you keep us in &s;uch &s;u&s;|pence!"</P>
<P>"Any thing of importance, my Lord?" &s;aid Mr. Freeman.</P>
<P>"News of the fir&s;t con&s;equence, Sir," replied the Lord.</P>
<P>"From the continent, I &s;uppo&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;" &s;aid Mr. Free|man.</P>
<P>"You are right, Sir&mdash;from the continent. We totally de&s;paired of &s;uch good fortune; for though we would ab&s;olutely not have &s;crupled &s;ending over a whole <HI>corps</HI> in exchange for him, the <HI>Great Nation</HI> would have &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in detaining him, had he not e&s;caped <HI>&s;ans ceremonie."</HI></P>
<P>"He is &s;afe arrived, then?" &s;aid Mr. Freeman.</P>
<P>"I have &s;een him," &s;aid his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Bravo!&mdash;Bravo!" cried Mr. Freeman, rubbing his hands. "He is a brave and gallant fellow, and I am glad of it with all my heart; and hope it won't be long before they &s;end him upon another <HI>blazing</HI> expedition again&s;t their navy."</P>
<P>Lord Morley &s;tared&mdash;"Blazing expedition!&mdash;Navy!&mdash;You'll pardon me, Sir; but, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pon my hon|our, I don't comprehend the allu&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Why, I'm alluding to Sir Sidney Smith, who you &s;ay has e&s;caped from the French."</P>
<P>"Sir Sidney!&mdash;the devil!" exclaimed his lord|&s;hip.
<PB N="105" REF="038596_0104_10129F2EC1598CF0">
"No, Sir, I do not concern my&s;elf about any &s;uch gunpowder gentry. I&mdash;Sir&mdash;am alluding to that dear delightful creature&mdash;Mon&s;ieur Caperonis&mdash;the fir&s;t dancer in Europe."</P>
<P>"P&s;ha!" &s;aid Mr. Freeman; "is that your im|portant intelligence?"</P>
<P>"Delightful!&mdash;Charming!&mdash;charming!"&mdash;cried Mrs. and the Mi&s;s Emerys.</P>
<P>The Reverend Mr. Ea&s;twood now entered the room: his pretty features &s;crewed into a &s;imper&mdash;twirling an eye gla&s;s in his hand, which was &s;u&s;pen|ded gracefully round his neck by a purple ribband; a white Cambrick handkerchief hung half out of his pocket; his left toe ju&s;t touched the ground, and he &s;tood the complete image of the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting character in the world&mdash;"a clerical fop!"</P>
<P>"Have they impo&s;ed upon me, my dear Lord Morley, or is it really true&mdash;The Caperonis&mdash;is he really arrived?"</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation flowed now &s;olely in this chan|nel, and Mr. Freeman, evidently di&s;gu&s;ted, &s;trolled out of the room, and Mr. Emery followed him.</P>
<P>The ladies engro&s;&s;ed Maria to them&s;elves; and George could only now and then make a remark. When, however, he had that opportunity, the &s;en&s;e or feeling of his ob&s;ervations was eagerly noticed by Maria, who failed not to contra&s;t them, to their advantage, with the in&s;ipidity and impertinence of the re&s;t of the party.</P>
<P>The appearance of Lambton was a relief to Barn|well, who called by appointment, to introduce him that evening to one of Mr. Heavi&s;ide's converzazioni.</P>
<P>"What a comfortable e&s;cape," &s;aid George to his friend; "and yet the&s;e are the beings &s;o em|phatically &s;tiled, by Shake&s;pear, the <HI>'makers of man|ners!'</HI>&mdash;Well may our manners be vapid Here, however," continued he, as they entered Mr. Hea|vi&s;ide's theatre, "we &s;hall meet minds of a dif|ferent mould."</P>
<P>Mr. Lambton found plea&s;ure in an&s;wering the que&s;tions of George concerning what he &s;aw, for
<PB N="106" REF="038596_0105_10129F30521A1FF0">
he was perfectly well read in the theory of anatomy, and was in the habit of intimacy with &s;everal pro|fe&s;&s;ional men. Among a group that were a&s;&s;embled round the fire, he pointed out to him a young man, as a poet of uncommon genius.</P>
<P>"He has the fire of Milton," &s;aid he; "but wants judgment. His writings re&s;emble a wild, uncultiva|ted &s;pot of ground, where the mo&s;t beautiful produc|tions of nature occa&s;ionally &s;urpri&s;e and delight the eye, but wanting the uniformity of de&s;ign, and arrange|ment of ta&s;te, fail in making any la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on the fancy. It is exactly &s;o with the works of that young enthu&s;ia&s;t, who has publi&s;hed already enough to rai&s;e the highe&s;t ideas of what he might have been, and at the &s;ame time to &s;how the world, that he will never reach that eminence.</P>
<P>"I perceive," continued he, "he is now deba|ting mo&s;t vehemently. We will join the party; but let me fir&s;t guard you again&s;t the warmth of his language and &s;entiments. He is a democrat from feeling. The French revolution bur&s;t upon his opening mind like a new created &s;un, and the rays of the new philo&s;ophy have &s;o dazzled his di&s;cern|ment, that his mind, enlightened only on one &s;ide, can di&s;cover neither beauty or truth out of the new &s;y&s;tem."</P>
<P>They joined the group, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ev|eral celebrated characters&mdash;George, all ear, li&s;|tened with avidity to the conver&s;ation, and felt a real delight when it was propo&s;ed to adjourn to a tavern, to &s;upper.</P>
<P>During &s;upper the conver&s;ation was general, and not very intere&s;ting, but when the waiters withdrew, and the gla&s;&s;es were placed on the table, George's heart beat high with expectation. When he &s;aw &s;uch celebrated characters &s;eated with him&s;elf at the &s;ame board, he almo&s;t debated with him&s;elf, which he de&s;ired to hear mo&s;t <HI>drawn out:</HI> and ju&s;tly imagi|ning, that, mo&s;t probably, he &s;hould never behold &s;uch another meeting, he hoped they would <HI>all</HI> en|ter into the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="038596_0106_10129F3322D966E8">
How un&s;table are human hopes! The young poet, who&s;e ardent fancy had formed &s;ome hundred lines, which he pre&s;ented to the managers of the theatre, as a tragedy, now appealed to the company for their opinion of his production. Then pulling out a bun|dle from his pocket, he began reading his tragedy, nor once attempted to de&s;i&s;t, till the <HI>exeunt omnes</HI> of the la&s;t &s;cene of the la&s;t act.</P>
<P>The production, which at any other time might have entertained him, appeared to George now per|fectly di&s;gu&s;ting; as, by its obtru&s;ion, the mouths of the whole company were clo&s;ed, till the &s;alutation of "Good night" broke up the party.</P>

<P>AFTER a week &s;pent in London, during which time he had in&s;pected the accounts which his partners laid before him, Mr. Freeman returned to his &s;eat in York&s;hire, leaving his daughter Maria in Portland Place.</P>
<P>The remainder of the winter was pa&s;&s;ed by the fa&s;hionable family of the Emerys in a round of amu&s;e|ments, of which the repetition would be tedious. The theatres, the opera, concerts, balls, routes and faro banks at length, however, yielded their influ|ence over the <HI>bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> monde</HI> to the various attractions of &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Away flew the Emery's to the Pavilion; which was a mo&s;t beautiful Villa built by Mr. Emery, from a de&s;ign of Wyat's, on the bank of the Thames, near Richmond.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="038596_0107_10129F3744062E90">
To this delightful &s;pot George frequently rode on an evening, and returned to town in the morn|ning; or &s;ometimes would remain there two or three days. The whole family delighted in his company; and though the Pavilion was never without a party of &s;ix or &s;even be&s;ides them&s;elves, yet the additional &s;ociety of Mr. Barnwell was always matter of plea|&s;ure. But to none was his conver&s;e &s;o &s;weet, his manners &s;o plea&s;ing, as to the gentle Maria.</P>
<P>Nor was her well cultivated mind, her well groun|ded principles, her grace, her elegance of manners, and winning &s;oftne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition unnoticed by Barnwell. A mutual e&s;teem was the re&s;ult. It may be properly called e&s;teem, for it was the homage of the judgment and the heart, unblended with pa&s;&s;ion: it was the delightful dawning of love; a &s;erene, plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation of the mind, unruffled by de&s;ire.</P>
<P>In their walks, they would ofttimes hear of each other's benevolence from the neighbouring cotta|gers.</P>
<P>In their mixed companies, a &s;mile of approbation from one, rewarded the expre&s;&s;ions or &s;entiments from the other. In the library their choice of authors was frequently the &s;ame; whil&s;t their private confer|ences &s;till more fully di&s;covered their conformity of &s;entiments and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Dividing his time betwixt the Pavilion and Port|land Place, alternately enjoying the &s;ociety of his friend Lambton and the amiable Maria, with ju&s;t enough of bu&s;ine&s;s to make his lei&s;ure more agreea|ble, George pa&s;&s;ed the months of this &s;ummer more plea&s;antly than any former period of his life.</P>
<P>The letters he received from his mother and Eliza, every week brought him the happie&s;t accounts of their health, and comfortable &s;ituation. The world appeared to his glad view a plea&s;ant garden; and blo&s;&s;oms of delight decorated his tranquil path.</P>
<P>Such was Barnwell; when, towards the clo&s;e of day, about the middle of September, a per&s;on muf|fled

up in a long black cloak, inquired for him in Portland Place; and upon being &s;hewn into a par|lour, di&s;covered him&s;elf to be Mental. He was grown paler, and much thinner, than when George &s;aw him la&s;t.</P>
<P>"Are you alone?" cried he.</P>
<P>"Yes," replied George.</P>
<P>"And are you at lei&s;ure?&mdash;Does no banquet wait for you?"</P>
<P>"None, I a&s;&s;ure you," replied Barnwell, "Mr. Emery is at Buxton, and the re&s;t of the family at the Pavilion."</P>
<P>"Is the door fa&s;t?&mdash;Bolt it&mdash;I have a &s;ecret to im|part."</P>
<P>George began to &s;urvey him more clo&s;ely. His manners &s;eemed even more wild, and his words more like madne&s;s, than when he parted with him. He obeyed him however, and repeated his a&s;&s;urances that they were alone.</P>
<P>"When I la&s;t &s;aw you, I gave you a miniature," &s;aid Mental. "Have you it about you?"</P>
<P>George drew it from his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>"Yet do not &s;hew it me!&mdash;Confirmation is un|nece&s;&s;ary. Put it up&mdash;put it up!&mdash;O, horrible!"&mdash;and he &s;huddered as if &s;eized with an ague.</P>
<P>Barnwell was affected&mdash;"Whatnew &s;orrow, Sir," &s;aid he, "afflicts you thus?&mdash;May I be en|tru&s;ted&mdash;?"</P>
<P>"Sorrow!" cried Mental; give it not &s;o &s;oft a name! Fools, women, children, can be &s;orry. If it rains, if the dews of heaven wet their &s;ilks, they are &s;orry. If a dance is po&s;tponed, or a play deferred, or a dinner &s;poiled, folks are &s;orry. What, then, but horror is it that a man mu&s;t feel, who having murdered his wife, drives his child to perdition!&mdash;My Elinor!&mdash;my daughter!"</P>
<P>"Have you heard any tidings of your daughter, Sir?" &s;aid Barnwell.</P>
<P>"Look at that miniature," &s;aid Mental. "It is the counterpart of that which you po&s;&s;e&s;s."</P>

room, which happened to be a dining parlour, and drinking a tumbler of water which &s;tood on the &s;ide|board, he appeared, after awhile, more compo&s;ed, and threw him&s;elf into a chair.</P>
<P>"It was my intention when you you came to re|&s;ide here, of which I was appri&s;ed, to have vi&s;ited you, but a &s;trange di&s;covery prevented me. Saun|tering, one day, through the &s;treets of the metropolis, my eye was attracted by a brilliant &s;how of jewellery and trinckets in the window of a pawnbroker. Among a crowd of other articles, in one corner of the window, were three miniatures, one of which (imagine my &s;urpri&s;e) &s;truck me as greatly re&s;em|bling what I had once &s;een. Upon a clo&s;er exami|nation, not a doubt remained of its being the coun|terpart of that which I pre&s;ented you at the abbey. The villain Linmore, in our happy days, painted the two likene&s;&s;es. One was my poor Elinor's, which I gave you; the other was given to the governe&s;s of my daughter, to be pre&s;ented to her, and I know was pre&s;ented to her, on her twelfth birthday.</P>
<P>"To &s;ee this miniature, then, was to &s;ee my daughter, and brought to my mind the painful re|collection of her uncertain fate. I purcha&s;ed it; and then, with an earne&s;tne&s;s that &s;urpri&s;ed the pawnbroker, reque&s;ted him to relate to me all he knew concerning it.</P>
<P>"Barren was his intelligence, amounting mere|ly to the recollection, that it was pledged there a|bout two years ago, by a woman who lived as a &s;er|vant to &s;ome ladies, at that time lodging nearly op|po&s;ite, at a hou&s;e that had &s;ince been pulled down.</P>
<P>'The woman,' he continued, '&s;till very often comes here; and you may, perhaps, learn &s;ome|thing further from her.'</P>
<P>"Day after day, forgetful of every thing el&s;e, I waited on the pawnbroker, and, in about a week, was informed the woman had been there, and had left her direction. I &s;ought her re&s;idence&mdash;a mi&s;e|rable one it was&mdash;the abode of infamy and lewd|ne&s;s!
<PB N="111" REF="038596_0110_10129F3D404CE780">
O, how my heart &s;ickened at the picture of mi&s;ery and vice, wretchedne&s;s and debauchery!&mdash;and how fearfully I gazed at each countenance&punc; dreading to behold among the hirelings of pro&s;titu|tion, my poor, abandoned child!</P>
<P>"The woman who had pledged the miniature told a plain tale frankly, that made the blood freeze in my veins! The ladies with whom &s;he re&s;ided, &s;he owned, were of that de&s;cription I feared&mdash;that the miniature, &s;he believed, belonged to the one who went by the name of Ellen, who had been well brought up, and had eloped very young, from a board|ing &s;chool, with an Iri&s;h officer.</P>
<P>"I doubted no longer. Ellen, I per&s;uaded my|&s;elf, was an abridgment of her own name; and I determined not to re&s;t till I di&s;covered her retreat, if living&mdash;her grave, if dead.</P>
<P>"The clue I gathered was, that, &s;oon after the miniature was parted with, the&s;e unfortunate wo|men quarrelled and &s;eparated. Ellen went with a young nobleman to Bath, and the other Unfortunate went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">broad.</P>
<P>"To Bath, the next day, I travelled po&s;t; and, by inquiries, found that the poor wretch re&s;ided there about &s;ix months, and then quitted that place for Bri&s;tol, where &s;he opened a little &s;hop with the wa|ges of her infamy, the nobleman having quitted her. Here &s;he re&s;ided nearly twelve months, when having met with impo&s;itions and lo&s;&s;es, &s;he became invol|ved in debt, and was compelled once one to &s;eek refuge from her creditors in the crowd of this me|tropolis, and returned to a mi&s;erable tra&s;&s;ick of &s;hame! O, what a year of mi&s;ery have I &s;ince endured!</P>
<P>"Every place of amu&s;ement, every haunt of plea|&s;ure, every mart of &s;ham<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, I have vi&s;ited, I have &s;trolled whole nights through the &s;treets of London, viewing each female with a dreadful curio&s;ity; but all was in vain: 'till, about a fortnight ago, at the corner of Exeter Street, in the Strand, I met the wo|man to whom I fir&s;t applied. She knew me, and acco&s;ted me&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="038596_0111_10129F4155EB7EF8">
'Ah! Sir,' cried &s;he, 'poor Ellen!'&mdash;</P>
<P>"I &s;eized her by the arm&mdash;What of Ellen?&mdash;Where is &s;he?&mdash;an&s;wer me!&mdash;&s;hew me where &s;he is!&mdash;exclaimed I.</P>
<P>'Haven't you &s;een her, then, Sir?&mdash;Poor thing, &s;he wou'dn't know you now, then&mdash;She's quite <HI>delirous!'</HI></P>
<P>"Take me to her this moment! &s;aid I. I fol|lowed her &s;ilently through &s;everal lanes and allies at the back of the Strand; till at length &s;he &s;topped at a dirty old hou&s;e, kept by a woman who &s;old green grocery. Feeling my way up two pair of dark &s;tairs, I entered a mi&s;erable apartment. The walls had once been white-wa&s;hed, but were now covered with &s;moak and dirt. A dull light was admitted through a &s;mall ca&s;ement darkened by pieces of old rags &s;tuffed in &s;everal places where the gla&s;s was broken. Not a chair, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">able, was in the room; no grate, nor &s;tove, was in the fire-place; but a few bits of wood were burning in one corner, over which an old woman, covered with rags and filth, was warming &s;omething in a pipkin.</P>
<P>"On the floor&mdash;On the <HI>floor!</HI> Mr. Barnwell," repeated Mental, "was a &s;ight to agoni&s;e a heart of &s;tone! A thin mattre&s;s only was betwixt the bare boards and a poor emaciated wretch, breathing out the la&s;t &s;igh of angui&s;h and de&s;pair!</P>
<P>'There's poor Ellen, Sir,' &s;aid the woman who conducted me. And then addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to the old woman&mdash;'Here, Mother Andrews,' &s;aid &s;he, 'is a good gentleman come to &s;ee poor Ellen!' 'God ble&s;s him for it,' &s;aid the old woman: 'but I'm <HI>afear'd</HI> its all over. I've been warming her a little tea&mdash;its all I've got to give her.'</P>
<P>"All this pa&s;&s;ed during my profound &s;ilence, for I <HI>could</HI> not &s;peak. I knelt by the poor dying object; I took her &s;en&s;ele&s;s hand, but in vain &s;earched for the re&s;emblance of my Elinor. The agonies of death had already deformed the countenance; and in a few moments, with a groan, &s;he expired! I dropped

a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear upon the lifele&s;s hand&mdash;the fir&s;t I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hed&mdash;and it greatly relieved me.</P>
<P>'God receive her poor &s;oul!' &s;aid the old wo|man.</P>
<P>"This arou&s;ed me. 'Ill fated child! of an ill fated mother!' cried I, and embraced the &s;en&s;ele&s;s corp&s;e. 'O, what a change from the blooming cherub of innocence, that I abandoned!' I &s;unk in agony upon the body. At length the voice of the old woman again arou&s;ed me&mdash;'Is there a Deity!&mdash;is there a Deity!' exclaimed I; 'and is this his world&mdash;and are we his creatures?&mdash;O, no, no, or the&s;e things would not be!' It was an ejaculation extorted by the keene&s;t angui&s;h, that ever pierced the human brea&s;t. The poor wretch gazed at me with a &s;ort of horror&mdash;</P>
<P>'Ah! Sir,' cried &s;he; 'don't talk &s;o!&mdash;There is a God who knows what's be&s;t for us all; and if we &s;uffer in this world, he can reward us in another!&mdash;and I am &s;ure, poor &s;oul, &s;he went through enough to atone for her folly. Poor creature!&mdash;nobody knows, but them that <HI>&s;ees,</HI> what they go through!'</P>
<P>"And who art thou, that ha&s;t &s;een &s;o much?" &s;aid I. 'Come&mdash;&s;it you down;&mdash;[there was a wa&s;h|ing tub and an old box, which &s;erved for chair and table]&mdash;and, if you <HI>can,</HI> relate me the &s;tory of this poor wretch!'</P>
<P>'I only <HI>know'd</HI> her lately. In their be&s;t days they keep higher company. I have lived ten years in this room; and, though Ellen is the fir&s;t that died here, I have 'tended many a one in &s;ickne&s;s on that bed. But then, if they get wor&s;e, they mo&s;tly <HI>got</HI> into &s;ome ho&s;pital, or went to their pari&s;h.'</P>
<P>"And were there no ho&s;pital, or pari&s;h, for her?</P>
<P>'Why, you &s;hall hear. Its about two-months ago, &s;ince, one very rainy night, this poor creature was brought here by one, that had formerly had half of my bed. She was that day thru&s;t out of doors by a hard-hearted creature, who thought her|&s;elf
<PB N="114" REF="038596_0113_10129F470ABF6F30">
an angel, truly, becau&s;e &s;he did not &s;end the poor &s;oul to jail, for about two and forty &s;hillings, that &s;he owed her.</P>
<P>'She was as thin as a lath! and had a cough; it made one's heart ache to hear it. The clothes up|on her back, and two &s;hillings and a pocket-piece were all &s;he had in the world. The girl that brought her was a tender hearted thing, and promi&s;ed that, if I would let her have half of my bed, &s;he would &s;ee me paid my groat a week regularly; and for a while &s;ure enough &s;he did, and brought her poor friend, now and then a ra&s;pberry tart, and a little wine. But all of a &s;udden &s;he left it off, and I have never &s;een her &s;ince. God knows but &s;he may now be in want her&s;elf.'</P>
<P>"This is Society! cried I, &s;haking as with an ague. 'Anan?' &s;aid the old woman, not under|&s;tanding me. She went on.</P>
<P>'So, then, I was obliged to break into her two &s;hillings; one went all at once for a bottle of &s;tuff for her cough; and &s;oon the other was &s;pent al&s;o. Then the poor clothes went; one thing after another. And at la&s;t &s;he grew quite <HI>delirous.</HI></P>
<P>'I had &s;aved up about a crown, but that I know'd wou'dn't la&s;t long; and as I could do no wa&s;hing for the other girls, while I tended her, there was nothing coming in; and &s;o I was obliged to apply for an or|der for her to be moved to the workhou&s;e, where &s;he was to have gone this morning; but la&s;t night &s;he changed &s;o for the wor&s;e, I thought it cruel to move her; and as &s;he wanted nothing but a little moi&s;ture in her mouth, I &s;aid I'd 'tend her till &s;he was relea&s;ed, and then they might &s;end for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">offin&mdash;.'</P>
<P>"No&mdash;No&mdash;cried I&mdash;I will provide what's want|ing <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w.</HI> Perhaps an earlier meeting might have &s;aved her life."</P>
<P>She was decently interred. The good Mrs. An|drews was rewarded. Good, I call her, for what|ever in her youth &s;he may have been, &s;he now po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
<PB N="115" REF="038596_0114_10129F49E07C0E28">
a heart that wills all good imaginable to her fellow creatures.</P>
<P>"Thus far I had acted upon the pre&s;umption of her being my child. There was little doubt upon the point, indeed; but &s;till it was not certain: when a circum&s;tance took place that confirmed me in doubt|ing rather than believing. I applied to the woman who &s;o inhumanly thru&s;t her from her hou&s;e, for in|formation; but &s;he could afford me none. There was a trunk of her's, &s;he &s;aid, in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which, upon paying what was owing, I might receive. She believed it was full of letters.</P>
<P>"I eagerly con&s;ented; and, upon opening the trunk, found it, as &s;he &s;aid, full of letters. Among them was a bundle written in a neat female hand. I untied this bundle, and found the letters &s;igned "Elinor." They are compo&s;itions of uncommon merit, as to &s;tile and manner; but the matter, though ingenious, is highly exceptionable.</P>
<P>"This circum&s;tance &s;taggered me extremely. That the letters were wrote by my daughter, is be|yond a doubt. They had been &s;ent under cover, and began "Dear Friend;" but no addre&s;s was upon them.</P>
<P>"The only conjecture, then, that can reconcile the decea&s;ed's having the&s;e letters, written by her|&s;elf in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is, that they have been returned from the per&s;on to whom they were written."</P>
<P>"It <HI>may</HI> be &s;o," &s;aid George; "but &s;urely it is not too much to hope, that the decea&s;ed, after all, was the friend who re&s;ided with your daughter; and that &s;he her&s;elf may yet be living."</P>
<P>"Not for the wealth of worlds would I change the certainty of her death for &s;uch a torturing &s;u&s;|pence. No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;I will cheri&s;h the thought of having laid her in the &s;ilent grave, though it be de|lu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Come with me&mdash;Come with me&mdash;I'll &s;hew you the &s;pot where &s;he lies. I'll repeat to you the &s;tory of her &s;ufferings; for, O, young man, in &s;uch a hou&s;e
<PB N="116" REF="038596_0115_10129F4E5351FFC8">
as this, the&s;e le&s;&s;ons are not common. The riot, the mirth, the glitter of guilt alone, you behold here. Come&mdash;come to the abodes of the dying, and the graves of the dead, and learn its certain con&s;equen|ces!" They walked out together.</P>

<P>A FEW days after Mental's vi&s;it, and while the Emerys were yet at the Pavilion, Barnwell received the following letter:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"It is with extreme reluctance that an unhappy &s;tranger obtrudes her&s;elf upon your notice.

<P>"Though perfectly unknown to his &s;on, the Rev.

It is, indeed, almo&s;t too much to &s;olicit the favour of a vi&s;it, though the tale I am compelled to relate I &s;hould be unwilling to tru&s;t on paper.

</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Curio&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion were awakened by this letter in the brea&s;t of Barnwell. Repeatedly, and di&s;tinctly, he read its contents. There was di&s;tre&s;s, yet delicacy&mdash;there was an appeal to his heart through the mo&s;t fine-wrought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lattery.&mdash;Above all, there was prai&s;e to the memory of a father, who&s;e &s;hade he adored&mdash;In the warmth of his fir&s;t impre&s;|&s;ions, he was going immediately to Berners Street; but the impropriety of &s;uch a &s;tep &s;oon occurred. This incident occupied his entire thoughts: he formed a variety of conjectures, planned his conduct according to the &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;es, and as &s;peedily renounced his imaginations as ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>That the purport of this vi&s;it was to afford him an opportunity of di&s;playing his genero&s;ity, &s;eemed certain; and he began a calculation of his finances. His uncle had remitted him large &s;ums. His ex|pences, though great, were well managed. He was a &s;trict economi&s;t; and therefore, though his hand had been liber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> his pur&s;e was not empty.</P>
<P>If, therefore, thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he, a temporary a&s;&s;i&s;tance will avail, I &s;hall have the &s;atisfaction of affording it; and if, on the contrary, a more deep calamity, than my ability can di&s;per&s;e, claims the ju&s;t notice of di&s;|criminating benevolence, there is my uncle, or even old Mental, who, I am &s;ure, will thank me for the information: and &s;urely the writer of this letter cannot be unworthy of their favour.</P>
<P>Such were the reflections of inexperience, and &s;uch the feelings of a benevolent and uncorrupted heart.</P>
<P>He wrote an an&s;wer, appointing the next morn|ing, at twelve o'clock, for the interview; and felt no incon&s;iderable anxiety till its arrival.</P>
<P>At the appointed hour he repaired to Berners Street, and was u&s;hered into a very neat and elegant drawing room. In a few minutes a lady entered,
<PB N="118" REF="038596_0117_10129F52C1081D48">
in deep mourning, with a work ba&s;ket in her hand. She &s;eemed almo&s;t &s;inking with di&s;&s;idence; and the &s;truggles of her wounded pride appeared depicted in her countenance. George ro&s;e, and bowed re&s;|pectfully.</P>
<P>"This conde&s;cen&s;ion, Sir," &s;aid &s;he, he&s;itating;&mdash;"the conde&s;cen&s;ion of this vi&s;it, is, at the &s;ame time, the &s;ource of &s;o much &s;atisfaction and pain!&mdash;that I mu&s;t reque&s;t your pardon:&mdash;but&mdash;I really&mdash;I!&mdash;." And &s;he &s;unk into her chair, and ap|plied her handkerchief to her face.</P>
<P>Barnwell &s;tood mute with &s;urpri&s;e. In&s;tead of the female of his imagination, worn with woe, and wa&s;ted with de&s;pair&mdash;a form and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ace had bur&s;t upon his view, the mo&s;t beautiful he had ever &s;een. Her figure, con&s;iderably above the middle &s;ize, was maje&s;tic, dignified, and elegant: her countenance admirably corre&s;ponded with her per&s;on. Dark hair, flowing in luxuriant ringlets on her forehead, and hanging loo&s;e on her neck, greatly heightened the effect of a mo&s;t delicate complexion, &s;till fur|ther a&s;&s;i&s;ted by well formed eye brows, and lips of coral hue.</P>
<P>Her dre&s;s was &s;imply elegant, and di&s;played the beauteous &s;ymmetry of her per&s;on to advantage. Af|ter a pau&s;e of &s;ome duration&mdash;</P>
<P>"Pray, be &s;eated, Sir," &s;aid &s;he, recovering her|&s;elf;&mdash;for Barnwell, uncon&s;cious that he did &s;o, had &s;tood &s;ilently gazing on the form before him&mdash;"How weak are our &s;tronge&s;t re&s;olves!" continued &s;he. "I had, I imagined, prepared my&s;elf for this interview; and thought my&s;elf &s;trongly armed again&s;t all the attacks of pride: but the remembrance of what they <HI>have</HI> been, is among the la&s;t things with which the unfortunate are compelled to part."</P>
<P>George, extremely afflicted at her di&s;tre&s;s, attempt|ed once or twice to &s;peak him&s;elf, but failed in the attempt. The lady continued&mdash;</P>
<P>"Many and powerful, were the &s;truggles I have en|countered, ere I re&s;olved upon &s;oliciting this inter|view; but the character of Mr. Barnwell, &s;o op|po&s;ite

to the volatile and unthinking youths of fa&s;h|ion (to whom a &s;tory of di&s;tre&s;s is the &s;ource either of &s;pleen or &s;corn) added to the very encouraging traits of benevolent &s;ympathy &s;o &s;trongly portrayed in his countenance, at length emboldened me to take a &s;tep, I have &s;ince, more than once, repented. I have therefore, Sir, to entreat your pardon for &s;o great a liberty; and hope you will completely era&s;e from your memory the indi&s;creet reque&s;t I have made."</P>
<P>"Madam&mdash;I&mdash;If I can&mdash;if it is in my pow|er&mdash;I &s;hall be happy, Madam&mdash;I hope&mdash;if there is any thing that&mdash;."</P>
<P>Such were the incoherent words of Barnwell, in who&s;e brea&s;t pity, which was its con&s;tant gue&s;t, now mingled its influence with a new and &s;trange &s;en|&s;ation;&mdash;&s;o &s;trange, &s;o new, as to create a wild alarm not only in his countenance, but in his words and manners.</P>
<P>"I perceive your generous intentions; but I can|not&mdash;I <HI>ought</HI> not&mdash;to take advantage of &s;o much good|ne&s;s!&mdash;How &s;trongly you re&s;emble your worthy father!"</P>
<P>"You know my father?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir, I knew him once&mdash;They were happy days when I knew Mr. Barnwell!&mdash;I little dreamt how &s;evere a de&s;tiny was to &s;ucceed tho&s;e joyful days. But, alas, how feeble is our hold on earthly bli&s;s&mdash;how fleeting our joy&mdash;how un&s;table our hopes of happine&s;s!&mdash;O, painful to contemplate the picture of what I have been&mdash;and view the gloomy &s;cenes before me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; Wealth, and friends, and hope, were then all mine. Now poverty, and enemies, and fell de&s;pair, &s;urround me; and the wor&s;t that Fate can ordain to mortals, is my gloomy expectation!"</P>
<P>Barnwell had &s;truggled to overcome his embar|ra&s;&s;ment; and collecting him&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible, he &s;aid&mdash;</P>
<P>"If the calamity, which has wrought &s;o unhap|py a change, may be communicated without pain, believe me, Madam, the confidence with which you

honour me &s;hall be re&s;pected, by one who has ever felt for the unhappy, but who never felt &s;o deeply as at the pre&s;ent moment."</P>
<P>"Ah, Sir!" &s;aid Milwood&mdash;and &s;ighed&mdash;"The &s;oothing voice of friend&s;hip," continued &s;he, "has been &s;o long unheard; my ear has been &s;o u&s;ed of late to the &s;ounds of anger and defiance, that the tenderne&s;s of your expre&s;&s;ions has the influence of mu&s;ic on my mind. But when you are acquainted with my &s;tory, I much fear that your language will be altered; and that, cea&s;ing to pity my misfortunes, you will only cen&s;ure my mi&s;conduct."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, Madam," &s;aid Barnwell. "The emotions of pity are arbitrary &s;en&s;ations, for the ju&s;tice of which we cannot be pre&s;umed re&s;pon&s;ible; but the voice of cen&s;ure ought at lea&s;t to have the &s;anction of experience, and the motives of preven|tion. To add poignancy of reproof to the &s;tings of conviction, betrays an unfeeling heart at all times; but mo&s;t unpardonable, indeed, would it be to pour reproach into the brea&s;t that &s;eeks, by confidence, the balm of con&s;olation!"</P>
<P>"Cea&s;e, Sir! I be&s;eech you, cea&s;e to &s;peak thus! You are not aware how much you increa&s;e the wound you &s;eek to heal!"</P>
<P>Then ri&s;ing from her chair, and walking with con|&s;iderable emotion about the room&mdash;</P>
<P>"I have borne oppre&s;&s;ion!" continued &s;he; "I have &s;uffered, with &s;ome degree of dignity, the <HI>'&s;tings and arrows of outrageous fortune;'</HI> but <HI>your</HI> pity, <HI>your</HI> &s;ympathy, Mr. Barnwell, di&s;arms me of my pur|po&s;e, and increa&s;es the weakne&s;s I had almo&s;t &s;ub|dued. I will ha&s;ten to relate to you my errors, that your &s;corn and contempt may &s;ubdue the baneful effects of your <HI>too cruel tenderne&s;s!"</HI></P>
<P>"My&s;terious!" exclaimed Barnwell, in a low tone of voice.</P>
<P>"Hear me, Sir.&mdash;My name is Milwood: my family is one of the mo&s;t ancient and re&s;pectable in the county where they re&s;ide. My parents both died ere I had attained an age to be &s;en&s;ible of their
<PB N="121" REF="038596_0120_10129F5D1C3490D8">
lo&s;s. I was the younge&s;t of &s;ix orphans. My elde&s;t brother who &s;ucceeded to the title and e&s;tates of his father, was at the period of his decea&s;e, a &s;tudent at Cambridge univer&s;ity; another brother was an en|&s;ign in the militia of the county; and a third &s;erved as a mid&s;hipman in the navy.</P>
<P>"I had two &s;i&s;ters, who, with my&s;elf, were taken under the guardian&s;hip of my mother's brother, the Dean of&mdash;. With this gentleman we re|&s;ided, enjoyed every advantage which his fortune or abilities could be&s;tow. As my father died inte&s;tate, and the whole of his property was in landed e&s;tates, every branch of the family was left dependent on the di&s;cretion and genero&s;ity of my elder brother.</P>
<P>"Poor Edward! Thy memory &s;hall never be in|&s;ulted by me, however &s;everely the con&s;equences of the errors fall on thy unhappy &s;i&s;ter: Suffice it, then, to ob&s;erve, that the indi&s;cretions of the youth at col|lege were made the means of enriching a few worth|le&s;s characters, who preyed upon the openne&s;s of his &s;oul, and con&s;igned to poverty and dependence tho&s;e, who were born with far better expectations.</P>
<P>"The remor&s;e he felt, that a fate &s;o unworthy of his hou&s;e &s;hould be brought upon it by him&s;elf, drove the ill-fated Edward to tho&s;e wretched expe|dients, which, lulling for a moment the pangs of recollection, increa&s;e the dread of thought, and hur|ry tho&s;e who &s;eek them to a grave of &s;hame.</P>
<P>"So 'twas with my poor Edward! Peace to his &s;pirit! My other brothers are each ri&s;ing to wealth and eminence in their profe&s;&s;ions. The elde&s;t of my &s;i&s;ters married to the &s;atisfaction of the Dean, and is now the happy mother of &s;everal children. My other &s;i&s;ter died.</P>
<P>"Now, Sir, I am to &s;peak of my&s;elf. From a long re&s;idence in his family, from his parental fond|ne&s;s, I had imbibed for the Dean, my uncle, all the tender feelings of a daughter. The Deanery was as my native home; and every de&s;ire that the young heart knows, was gratified as &s;oon as known. 'Twas
<PB N="122" REF="038596_0121_10129F5EAE2FFD68">
here I once was honored with the &s;ociety of your father. He was an excellent man." [George bowed.] "I have no particular event to detail," continued Milwood, "till, about two years ago, when a di&s;|tant relation of the Dean's who had been &s;ome time upon a vi&s;it at the Deanery, did me the honor to offer me propo&s;als of marriage. It was not the fir&s;t offer I had received; but it was the fir&s;t that had re|ceived the pre&s;&s;ing recommendation of the Dean.</P>
<P>"I an&s;wered, however, to this propo&s;al, as I had uniformly done to others; and candidly intimated, that I did not feel that affection, on which alone I built my hopes of happine&s;s in the married &s;tate; and without which, it was my firm determination never to approach the altar!</P>
<P>"Why, then did he &s;till pur&s;ue me? Why did he commence a per&s;ecution, that can only terminate with my exi&s;tence! Or why O, my beloved uncle&punc; why did the cold calculations of intere&s;t outweigh, in thy brea&s;t, the pleadings of nature!</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t check my&s;elf.&mdash;The wealth and honors of the gentleman who was my &s;uitor were among his inferior recommendations. Elegant in his per&s;on and manners; happy and uniform in his temper; mild and benevolent in his di&s;po&s;ition; learned without pedantry; witty, without &s;atire; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed al|mo&s;t every qualification that could render him amia|ble and e&s;timable. Yet, Sir, I felt for Lord Nare&s;by nothing like love. I admired his accompli&s;hments; I re&s;pected his virtues; but, alas! this &s;tate of mind is far &s;hort of love. You, perhaps, Mr. Barnwell, as well as my&s;elf, are, I pre&s;ume, &s;en&s;ible how dif|ferent the operations of our hearts are from the cool exerci&s;es of our under&s;tandings!"</P>
<P>The abruptne&s;s of this appeal, and the penetra|ting look that accompanied it, overwhelmed with confu&s;ion the youth to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed. Barn|well blu&s;hed deeply; he &s;tammered; but his words were incoherent &s;ounds.</P>
<P>Of love, as a pa&s;&s;ion, he had hitherto known no|thing
<PB N="123" REF="038596_0122_10129F6045E31480">
but the name. There was, perhaps, &s;omething extremely like the beginnings of love now &s;trug|gling for exi&s;tence in his bo&s;om; but it was a new, a &s;trange &s;en&s;ation, of who&s;e origin he was ig|norant; of who&s;e influence he had no conception.</P>
<P>Milwood, who&s;e penetration and art equalled her beauties, ob&s;erved with &s;atisfaction, with delight, the di&s;order of which &s;he well knew her&s;elf the creator. Di&s;&s;embling, however the joy &s;he felt un|der the well feigned &s;emblance of &s;orrow, &s;he con|tinued her tale.</P>
<P>"My uncle," &s;aid &s;he, "&s;o warmly e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of Lord Nare&s;by, as to de&s;cend to threats of his di&s;plea&s;ure, if I per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing his propo&s;als. He is naturally a humane man; but, in this in&s;tance, his anger overcame him, and his expre&s;&s;ions were har&s;h and cruel. Still, Sir, I per&s;i&s;ted in my refu&s;al.</P>
<P>My brothers, were appealed to. My married &s;i&s;ter, and her lord, were al&s;o made my judges; and with one voice they all condemned me to the cruel alternative of marrying a man, for whom I felt no preference; or of forfeiting, for ever, their protec|tion and e&s;teem!</P>
<P>"The mo&s;t in&s;ulting and unfeeling motives were attributed to me in rejecting &s;o &s;plendid and hon|ourable a propo&s;al. I was &s;hunned by the whole family. My walks were at fir&s;t watched; at la&s;t, prohibited. I was detained a pri&s;oner in my uncle's ca&s;tle, nor ever permitted to walk beyond the boun|daries of his Park.</P>
<P>"As my relations increa&s;ed their cruelty towards me, Lord Nare&s;by redoubled his tenderne&s;s and at|tention; obtaining by his intere&s;t occa&s;ional liberties, and &s;ome few marks of concern from my tyrants; but, in&s;tead of gaining, by this conduct, any advance in my e&s;teem, it &s;unk him beneath the former level of indifference, and I became di&s;gu&s;ted with a man, who would con&s;ent to receive &s;uch mean advantages.</P>
<P>"My &s;ituation grew daily more and more into|lerable. A faithful &s;ervant, who had attended me
<PB N="124" REF="038596_0123_10129F61E2899168">
for many years, was di&s;charged, upon the pretended &s;u&s;picion of aiding me in an ideal corre&s;pondence, which they &s;aid I carried on with &s;ome low born wretch, whom I had the meanne&s;s to prefer to the man of their choice.</P>
<P>"Alas! how much were they mi&s;taken, if, in|deed, they imagined my heart at that time had a preference among mankind. No, Sir, not even a friend, beyond poor Mary, whom they di&s;charged, had I in the whole world. When &s;he was gone, they placed over me a cruel, in&s;olent old woman, in the capacity of a &s;ervant, but with the powers of a mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Debarred the comforts of &s;ociety, of reading, drawing, or any other amu&s;ement, my mind, un|&s;haken in its re&s;olution, became de&s;perate; and af|ter duly weighing all the ob&s;tacles that oppo&s;ed them&s;elves to &s;uch a &s;tep, I determined to quit, for ever, the hou&s;e that had hitherto been my a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>"My faithful Mary found means to acquaint me, in my captivity, that, after her di&s;mi&s;&s;al, &s;he had tra|velled, at her own expence, twenty eight miles from the ca&s;tle to an old lady who was my father's di&s;tant relation, but an inveterate foe to my uncle, and all my mother's relations.</P>
<P>"This lady, a widow, and childle&s;s, was extreme|ly rich; and though &s;he had never &s;een me, &s;uch was the &s;ucce&s;s of Mary's tale of my &s;ufferings, that &s;he commi&s;&s;ioned her to tell me, &s;he would receive me as her daughter, if I could e&s;cape from the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>I did e&s;cape; and Mary and I were received by my relation with every mark of kindne&s;s and re&s;|pect.</P>
<P>"I have particular rea&s;ons for concealing, for the pre&s;ent, the name of this lady and her re&s;idence.</P>
<P>My uncle &s;oon di&s;covered my retreat, and wrote a letter filled with indignation at my conduct, and a formal renunciation; in which he was joined by my brothers and &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>"In my new &s;ituation I was, for &s;ome time, as
<PB N="125" REF="038596_0124_10129F69C3AE4A90">
happy as I could wi&s;h; till an event&mdash;But let me &s;top in time&mdash;If I proceed with &s;incerity to relate the cau&s;e of my unhappine&s;s, I am afraid&mdash;indeed, Mr. Barnwell&mdash;I am much afraid, the lo&s;s of your e&s;teem would be the painful con&s;equence; and hea|ven only knows how highly I e&s;teem your good opinion.</P>
<P>"Madam!"&mdash;exclaimed Barnwell.</P>
<P>"Aye, Sir, you may well be &s;urpri&s;ed!&mdash;My face, my voice, are new to you; but not &s;o your's to me."</P>
<P>"Indeed!" &s;aid Barnwell. "Where, pray, have you then &s;een it?"</P>
<P>"No matter, Sir&mdash;&s;ince I now &s;ee it for the last time!"</P>
<P>"I hope not!" &s;aid Barnwell, with warmth. "Stranger as you are to me, Madam, I feel &s;o deeply intere&s;ted, &s;o much concerned, for your welfare, that, excepting my &s;i&s;ter and my mother, I know no per&s;on in the world I more ardently de&s;ire to &s;erve."</P>
<P>"You are kind&mdash;you are very kind!" &s;aid Mil|wood.</P>
<P><HI>"Can</HI> I &s;erve you, Madam?"</P>
<P>"You <HI>alone, can</HI> &s;erve me; but you <HI>will not,</HI> nay, you <HI>&s;hall not</HI> &s;erve me."</P>
<P>"You &s;peak my&s;teriou&s;ly, and look wild. Fear not, I be&s;eech you, to confide to me your &s;orrows!&mdash;my bo&s;om &s;hall be their &s;acred repo&s;itory."</P>
<P>"Generous&mdash;generous youth!" &s;aid Milwood; and, with a &s;eeming uncon&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, threw her arm upon his &s;houlder: then, appearing to recollect her|&s;elf, ha&s;tily withdrew it.</P>
<P>Every moment now increa&s;ed the de&s;ire of George to be made acquainted with her di&s;tre&s;s. He gazed earne&s;tly upon her face, endeavouring to read her &s;orrows in her countenance. He ventured to take her hand&mdash;</P>
<P>"Dear lady, let me intreat you no longer to de|lay the recital of your woes. Of whatever nature they may prove, God only grant me the power to remove them, and I &s;hall be the happie&s;t of all men."</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="038596_0125_10122B28653D4788">
"Your genero&s;ity of mind, your tenderne&s;s of heart, are indeed the objects of my admiration! But, alas; my calamity is of &s;o peculiar a nature, that the mo&s;t generous mind, the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible heart, cannot conceive any thing that can alleviate it. Mine is a &s;ilent &s;orrow, that broods within my own brea&s;t. A &s;igh is its only expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;a tear is its only re|lief:&mdash;no tongue has proclaimed it: no ear has re|ceived its complaint. To you it de&s;ires to &s;peak&mdash;to you <HI>alone</HI> it <HI>will ever</HI> &s;peak; but&mdash;&s;pare me&mdash;pardon me&mdash;leave me!"&mdash;And &s;he wept.</P>
<P>How &s;trange is her behaviour, thought Barnwell:&mdash;how wild, yet how mournful her countenance! After a pau&s;e, Milwood, recovered her former &s;eren|ity, and continued&mdash;</P>
<P>"I am to blame, Sir, thus to trifle with your time. I will endeavour to conclude my dull narrative, and at all hazards venture to explain the motive of my reque&s;t to &s;ee you.</P>
<P>"My benefactre&s;s, who&s;e bounty was my only re&s;ource, continued to treat me with the affectionate regard of a parent; my days rolled on in comfort; and my heart knew no di&s;tre&s;s, till that event to which I before alluded. O, God! how &s;hall I re|late it!&mdash;But it mu&s;t be told.</P>
<P>"There re&s;ided near our dwelling a family of re&s;|pectability, but not wealthy; they therefore did not vi&s;it our hou&s;e, but we once or twice met in the neighbourhood. Of the father&mdash;of the mother&mdash;of the daughter, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing; but of the &s;on!&mdash;Pardon me&mdash;Indeed, I cannot proceed!"</P>
<P>"Wave this reluctance," cried Barnwell. "Con|fide in me, as your brother:&mdash;you &s;hall find me as tender of your feelings, as zealous in your &s;ervice, as if one womb had borne us."</P>
<P>"What do I hear!" cried Milwood, with quick|ne&s;s. "Is it po&s;&s;ible! Did you &s;ay, you loved me as a brother!&mdash;Happy, happy moment!" She took his hand, and ki&s;&s;ing it with warmth, exclaimed&mdash;"My brother&mdash;my brother!"</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="038596_0126_10129F6B54E0E4F8">
Barnwell &s;tarting from his chair, and &s;natching away his hand, &s;eemed thrown into a delirium; whil&s;t Milwood, appearing to recollect her&s;elf, hung down her head, and blu&s;hed.</P>
<P>"In the name of heaven, Madam, tell me, who and what you are? Fini&s;h, I be&s;eech you, this my&s;|terious tale, and quickly, that I may, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;erve you; or if not, may in&s;tantly e&s;cape a pre&s;ence that creates emotions of pain and plea&s;ure, too pow|erful to be long endured!"</P>
<P>"I entreat your forgivene&s;s," cried Milwood. "But go, Sir&mdash;go&mdash;ere you know the mi&s;ery <HI>you</HI> have occa&s;ioned&mdash;the &s;torm of ruin that <HI>you</HI> have rai&s;ed&mdash;Go ignorant of my wretchedne&s;s, which to know, would perhaps excite a painful pity in your brea&s;t, but no relief to me!&mdash;Since to behold me is &s;o painful&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I did not &s;ay &s;o!" cried Barnwell "or if I did&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I &s;ee," &s;aid Milwood, "we are both too much agitated. Your &s;urpri&s;e, and perhaps your pity, have overpowered you; whil&s;t I&mdash;I am the prey of feelings which rack my bo&s;om with torture inex|pre&s;&s;ible!"</P>
<P>"'Tis &s;u&s;pen&s;e alone that tortures me," cried Barnwell. "Your manner&mdash;your my&s;terious words&mdash;and the wildne&s;s of your eyes, make me dread a &s;omething, which I fear&mdash;yet a&s;k&mdash;to know!&mdash;You &s;peak of a youth who re&s;ided near you&mdash;You talk of ruin, of mi&s;ery, of which I am the au|thor&mdash;You reque&s;t to &s;ee me&mdash;You de&s;ire me to leave you, as ignorant as I came!&mdash;Whence &s;pring &s;uch incon&s;i&s;tencies?"</P>
<P>"From a &s;ource <HI>you</HI> have never dreamt of," &s;aid Milwood, with firmne&s;s;&mdash;"from Love!"&mdash;</P>
<P>Her countenance was now altered from the pic|ture of contending influence, to a portrait of deter|mination! Her eyes were fixed firmly on Barnwell:&mdash;&s;he remained &s;ilently gazing on his face a con|&s;iderable time. Barnwell him&s;elf was dumb.</P>
<P>"'Tis over!" at length cried Milwood: "I have

conquered!&mdash;The youth to whom I alluded, is&mdash;George Barnwell!&mdash;Yes!&mdash;he it is, whom Fate has ordained my de&s;truction! For him, I quit my friends, my country&mdash;For him, I forfeit affluence, and embrace the horrors of poverty, in a foreign and di&s;tant clime!&mdash;Was it, then, too much to a&s;k the favour of one hour's interview, merely to declare how ardently I love, and how largely I &s;acrifice to an hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>"O Nature!&mdash;can I thank thee for the liberal &s;hare of per&s;onal attractions thy hand has given me, &s;ince they have but &s;erved to heap upon my head the per&s;ecutions of a train that I cannot help de&s;pi&s;ing, while on that heart alone, which I e&s;teem, their in|fluence is too weak to impre&s;s even a cold regard!"</P>
<P>Barnwell was lo&s;t in wonder! after various at|tempts&mdash;"I do not remember ever to have &s;een you before!" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"I can too ea&s;ily believe you, Sir."</P>
<P>"And yet, I think, if ever I had beheld &s;uch a countenance as your's, &s;urely, Madam, I could not have forgotten its intere&s;ting traits!"</P>
<P>"Nay, Sir," cried Milwood, I mu&s;t not hear you, if your voice a&s;&s;umes that &s;train. Do not imagine Sir, my declaration meant to claim your pity! No,&mdash;my re&s;olution is fixed as firmly as the decrees of Fate. One moment longer let me detain your ear and then, farewell for ever!&mdash;Briefly, then&mdash;the &s;ame per&s;ecutions, though from different quarters, rendered the abode of my benefactre&s;s as mi&s;erable as my uncle's, with this addition of wretchedne&s;s&mdash;that in the latter, my heart was wholly di&s;engaged; in the former, your image, your worth, barred all avenues to affection for another.</P>
<P>"The object &s;o dear to me was unknown to my benefactre&s;s&mdash;to all the world&mdash;but my&s;elf. My refu&s;als were therefore deemed ob&s;tinacy; my per|&s;everance became rebellion; and I was at length driven to the dreadful alternative of quitting, for ever, the refuge I had obtained, or to approach the &s;olemn altar, and vow fidelity with my lips, whil&s;t my heart would be adulterous for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="038596_0128_10129F6ED05AB0F8">
"Such was the choice held out for my adoption: and could I he&s;itate? No, not for a moment!

<P>She cea&s;ed.

Milwood with the tendere&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of concern, took his hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it warmly.</P>
<P>"If I have given <HI>you</HI> pain&mdash;if I have relieved my own brea&s;t, at the expence of a moment's unea&s;ine&s;s, to you&mdash;what a &s;ource of eternal regret!

<P>IN the mo&s;t profound reverie Barnwell pa&s;&s;ed the di&s;tance betwixt Berners Street and Mr. Emerys'. The crowd that &s;urrounded him, the bu&s;tle of car|riages, were in&s;ufficient to arou&s;e him from a &s;ort of &s;tupor into which he had fallen.</P>
<P>When he arrived at home, he ru&s;hed through the
<PB N="132" REF="038596_0131_10129F78B9D6B788">
hall, and hurrying to his own room, threw him&s;elf into a chair&mdash;"Milwood!&mdash;Milwood!" mutter|ed he; 'I never heard the name; I have no recol|lection of the face before to-day.&mdash;O, what an im|portant day! Tho&s;e looks!&mdash;that form!&mdash;never will my memory lo&s;e the impre&s;&s;ion!"</P>
<P>He &s;ighed deeply, and painfully.&mdash;"Love <HI>me!</HI>&mdash;Yes, &s;he loves me! She owns it: nay, her beha|viour declares it more powerfully than her words! What a wond'rous effect has &s;he wrought upon me! What means this &s;welling of the heart this quick|ne&s;s of the pul&s;e&mdash;this difficulty of re&s;piration? Can I imbibe a partiality &s;o in&s;tantaneou&s;ly? Are our na|tures, indeed, &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible?&mdash;Surely, it cannot be! 'Tis pity for Milwood&mdash;for her &s;ufferings&mdash;that pains me thus. Then let me &s;often them as much as po&s;|&s;ible&mdash;let me &s;end her in writing the oath &s;he requires, and &s;pare her the pain of another interview! and yet&mdash;<HI>never</HI> to &s;ee her again!&mdash;Why do I feel a dread at that thought? Suppo&s;e &s;he &s;hould be alrea|dy gone? Forbid it heaven! Once more&mdash;once more, let me behold a form &s;o lovely! What brilliant expre&s;&s;ion in her eyes!&mdash;what &s;en&s;e! what anima|tion in her countenance!&mdash;How happily might I pa&s;s my life with &s;uch a woman! But then her &s;itu|ation&mdash;my own too! Madne&s;s alone can &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch a thought. She is proud&mdash;I dare not offer her pe|cuniary aid. Where can &s;he go? What part of the globe does &s;he &s;eek? Unhappy Milwood! Would I had never &s;een you!&mdash;Would to God I had never &s;een you!"</P>
<P>Such were the meditations of Barnwell&mdash;Mil|wood ab&s;orbed all his thoughts, while her beauteous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orm floated in air before his imagination! Never, till this day, had his imagination been heated by the charms of woman!</P>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Maria Freeman he beheld an amiable compan|ion, who&s;e mode&s;ty and beauty mingled won the e&s;teem of his heart, and the approbation of his un|der&s;tanding; but in Milwood he &s;aw a far different female.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="038596_0132_10129F7B930F1EB0">
This woman was beautiful in the extreme. Na|ture had, indeed been liberal of her gifts, and educa|tion had increa&s;ed the value of her bounty. Milwood had once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every thing de&s;irable in the female character; for &s;he once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed virtue and inno|cence. But &s;he parted with innocence, and in its &s;tead had admitted, as the gue&s;t of her heart, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed cunning.</P>
<P>At an early period of her life &s;he had &s;urrendered all claim to cha&s;tity, and had &s;ince then &s;ubmitted to that mi&s;erable traffic, which is the mo&s;t &s;evere libel on civilized &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Too a&s;piring to herd with the unhappy cla&s;s to which &s;he had reduced her&s;elf, her &s;trong and tow|ering mind was perpetually bu&s;ied upon &s;chemes more valuable to her&s;elf, and far loftier in the &s;cale of wickedne&s;s than the generality of tho&s;e unfortu|nate beings, who&s;e daily infamy is their daily bread!</P>
<P>In her own fall, &s;he was the dupe of a profe&s;&s;ed rake; and her own &s;chemes upon the tranquility of others were all infu&s;ed with a large portion of re|venge. Man at large &s;he deemed her enemy; and the talents, and the charms &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;he con&s;id|ered as the weapons of revenge.</P>
<P>Unlike many a &s;ighing wretch, whom &s;evere di&s;|tre&s;s urges to compunctive acts of &s;hame, Milwood was &s;y&s;tematically vicious. The pre&s;ent world bounded her views of futurity, and the &s;truggles of the pre&s;ent &s;cene ended, in her imagination, the drama of exi&s;tence!</P>
<P>Thus, no principles of a religious nature &s;wayed her thoughts, no checks of con&s;cience ever intervened betwixt the inclination and the deed: Pity, and all the tender &s;en&s;ibilities which many natures feel, were her inward deri&s;ion; but their &s;emblance was per|fectly at her command.</P>
<P>Such was Milwood! Such was &s;he, for whom Barnwell, at fir&s;t &s;ight, had uncon&s;ciou&s;ly imbibed the mo&s;t powerful love!</P>
<P>She had never once &s;een his father, or any of his
<PB N="134" REF="038596_0133_10129F7E70AC4038">
relations; nor had ever beheld Barnwell him&s;elf, till his arrival at Mr. Emery's. Having learnt the very great confidence repo&s;ed in him, the large &s;ums en|tru&s;ted to his care, &s;he was not long in arranging a method to en&s;nare him within her power. For this purpo&s;e, &s;he had &s;pared no pains to obtain the intel|ligence &s;he had gained concerning his family, and had feigned the &s;tory &s;he had related to him, and which containad not one &s;yllable of truth.</P>
<P>Her &s;entiments, her tone of voice, her ge&s;tures, were &s;tudied for the occa&s;ion; and &s;he was guided, from moment to moment in the plan &s;he would pur|&s;ue, by the effect which her penetration di&s;covered &s;he had wrought on her victim.&mdash;Thus artfully had &s;he prepared the ground-work of her plot; and had thus far &s;ucceeded to the extent of her wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The interim, betwixt his departure and the hour at which &s;he expected his return, was anxiou&s;ly &s;pent by Milwood; and &s;he repented, more than once, that &s;he had &s;uffered him to leave her: a &s;tep to which &s;he had con&s;ented, chiefly to carry on appearances, and from a per&s;ua&s;ion, in which &s;he was not mi&s;taken, of her power over him.</P>
<P>Meanwhile he, for whom her machinations were devi&s;ed, was planning the means of rendering her happy. Many and various were the re&s;olutions he formed, but all un&s;table. His heart had admitted a &s;park, which his rea&s;on was too impotent to extin|gui&s;h, and which was ri&s;ing rapidly into a flame, of who&s;e influence he was ignorant, but who&s;e warmth he began to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>If the imagination of Barnwell was already wro't to a dangerous warmth, the next reception he met with in Berners Street was well calculated to increa&s;e it.</P>
<P>On a crim&s;on dama&s;k &s;ofa, placed under a brilliant mirror, illuminated by wax lights, reclined the Syren Milwood.&mdash;A mo&s;t elegant white dre&s;s had &s;uper&s;e|ded the &s;able weeds of the morning; with a Turki&s;h turban, ornamented with gold cords and ta&s;&s;els. The
<PB N="135" REF="038596_0134_10129F814EC518F0">
&s;olemn air of dignified &s;orrow was exchanged for the mo&s;t fa&s;cinating &s;miles; and in&s;tead of the re&s;erved and ba&s;hful demeanour, Barnwell had prepared him|&s;elf to meet, he was thrown off his guard by the mo&s;t alluring glances.</P>
<P>She did not ri&s;e when he entered the room, but holding out a mo&s;t beautiful arm, encircled at the wri&s;t with a brilliant bracelet&mdash;</P>
<P>"Mr. Barnwell!" &s;aid &s;he, with an enchanting &s;oftne&s;s.</P>
<P>George approached in the mo&s;t profound a&s;ton|i&s;hment, and received her offered hand.</P>
<P>"Am I not a &s;trange creature!" continued &s;he. "My trappings of woe, you &s;ee, are &s;oon thrown off. But, in truth, I did not think it con&s;i&s;tent with the plea&s;ure I expected, in your &s;ociety, to wear the &s;em|blance of &s;orrow!"</P>
<P>George was petrified with amazement, and doubt|ed, for a moment, whether the woman of &s;entiment he had &s;een in the morning, and the wanton form now before him, were the &s;ame. As &s;he &s;till held his hand in her's, &s;he fixed her &s;parkling eyes full on his face&mdash;</P>
<P>"You have an uncommon countenance!" &s;aid &s;he. "You are very &s;evere&mdash;and yet have great &s;en|&s;ibility. You are a compound of the &s;tern and the tender: I &s;carcely know which preponderates in your nature. You do not lack courage, or fortitude; at the &s;ame time you will weep at a tale of mi&s;ery, and the unfortunate are &s;ure of your &s;ympathy. Is it not &s;o? I have &s;tudied Lavater. Now, let me try if I am mi&s;taken. Place that harp nearer me, and I'll &s;ing you a ditty about a poor &s;imple maid&mdash;'who never told her love, but let concealment,' as the poet &s;ays&mdash;and &s;o on&mdash;Now be &s;ilent!"</P>
<P>It is difficult to convey an idea of Barnwell's &s;itua|tion at the pre&s;ent moment. The feelings with which he had entered the room were changed &s;o &s;uddenly, it &s;eemed the work of inchantment. Pity for the &s;orrows of Milwood was ab&s;olutely forgotten in the bewildered admiration of her charms; and the
<PB N="136" REF="038596_0135_10129F842668DAF0">
determination of his rea&s;on, as to the &s;teps he &s;hould pur&s;ue, was lo&s;t in the delightful and intoxicating dream of the exi&s;ting moment.</P>
<P>He placed the harp&mdash;and Milwood, changing her features from the wanton to the langui&s;hing, gave him the manu&s;cript to hold, while &s;he &s;ung and ac|companied a &s;imply plea&s;ing ballad with exqui&s;ite ta&s;te and melody. The expre&s;&s;ion of her eyes was perfectly in uni&s;on with the words; and her voice uttered the &s;weete&s;t &s;ounds!&mdash;It was a pathetic &s;tory, and affected Barnwell extremely.</P>
<P>"There," cried &s;he, "I knew you would weep&mdash;at a fiction too! And will not real &s;ufferings," con|tinued &s;he, in a tender voice, "at lea&s;t as much af|fect you!&mdash;Ah! Mr Barnwell&mdash;to me only you are in&s;en&s;ible! My abrupt &s;incerity has made me the object of your &s;corn!&mdash;Yes, cruel and in|&s;en&s;ible, you return the mo&s;t glowing affection with the colde&s;t di&s;dain!"</P>
<P>"Di&s;dain!&mdash;O, no!" &s;aid Barnwell:&mdash;"&s;ay, rather, admiration and e&s;teem! Where is the being, who could gaze on &s;uch charms, and di&s;dain their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or? How mu&s;t the heart be formed, that can remain in&s;en&s;ible to &s;o much beauty!"</P>
<P>"There are hearts, I fear," &s;aid Milwood, "round which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cy hand of worldly prudence forms a cir|cle, that freezes every pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul. There are beings, who can love according to a &s;cale of rea|&s;on, and model their affections by a &s;tandard! But I do not&mdash;cannot&mdash;think &s;o young a heart as your's&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Our Rea&s;on," interrupted Barnwell, "&s;hould regulate, not de&s;troy our pa&s;&s;ions!"</P>
<P>"Charming philo&s;ophy!" cried Milwood, with a &s;atirical &s;mile. "And where did you learn that maxim? I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome ponderous folio &s;o &s;ays. But have books hearts? No, no, Mr. Barn|well. A&s;k tho&s;e who wrote the &s;en&s;ele&s;s lies, what is this Rea&s;on, that is &s;o omnipotent? Where is it to be &s;een&mdash;or who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it?"</P>
<P>"A&s;toni&s;hing!" &s;aid Barnwell. "Do you, then deny the exi&s;tence of Rea&s;on?"</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="038596_0136_10129F88A4C8FA18">
"Yes, &s;uch Rea&s;on as the black letter gentlemen depict. Can Rea&s;on quench the thir&s;t, or &s;atiate the appetite of hunger?&mdash;Ah! no&mdash;no! And is the &s;tronge&s;t impul&s;e of our natures to be &s;o ea&s;ily &s;wayed by Rea&s;on then? Why have we pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;merely to torment us! O, infamous libel on the Author of our exi&s;tence, who has given his creatures all things to enjoy.&mdash;Well &s;ings the poet&mdash;<HI>To enjoy is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o obey!"</HI></P>
<P>The air, the doctrine of Milwood now rou&s;ed, for the fir&s;t moment, a &s;u&s;picion in his mind of her in|tentions, which &s;tartled Barnwell. He &s;unk into a profound reverie, his eyes ca&s;t on the floor.&mdash;Mil|wood ob&s;erved it, and &s;aw the &s;truggle that was ri|&s;ing in his brea&s;t. Perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of her art, &s;he was aware how imperceptibly her bold advances had &s;tolen into his heart, and with a cunning caution re|&s;trained her efforts, and changed her operations.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of attempting to continue an argument, at which &s;he well knew he revolted, &s;he touched the &s;trings of the harp, and rai&s;ed an inchantment of mel|ody: from the &s;lowe&s;t and the &s;ofte&s;t, to the mo&s;t bri&s;k and lively mea&s;ures, her fingers &s;wept the trem|bling chords. The effect on Barnwell was in&s;tan|taneous. In vain did the enamoured youth aim to repre&s;s the ri&s;ing flame&mdash;in vain attempted to re&s;i&s;t the maddening impul&s;e of de&s;ire!&mdash;On the precipice of danger, he was ignorant of his &s;ituation. His cheeks flu&s;hed, his eyes looked wild, and he fell back on the &s;ofa, overcome with the force of &s;uch new and powerful emotions.</P>
<P>The &s;yren &s;aw her time. She &s;truck the harp again, and&mdash;
<Q><L>" Softly &s;weet in Lydian mea&s;ures,</L>
<L>" Soon <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;ooth'd his &s;oul to plea&s;ures."</L></Q></P>
<P>She &s;ighed&mdash;&s;he gazed with looks of warme&s;t love&mdash;&s;he &s;eemed to yield her &s;oul to her de&s;ires&mdash;&s;unk by the &s;ide of Barnwell&mdash;reclined her head upon his cheek&mdash;pre&s;&s;ed the warm lips to his, and con|quered.</P>

<P>"NOT at home all night!" exclaimed Mental, in the hall at Mr. Emery's&mdash;"not at home all night!" repeated he.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was &s;peaking, Barnwell knocked at the door. At the &s;ight of Mental he &s;tarted back, and hung down his head. His hair was undre&s;&s;ed, his eyes were read and &s;welled, and his whole appear|ance proclaimed the revelry in which the night had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mental &s;urveyed him lei&s;urely from head to foot; during which time Barnwell recovered from his &s;ur|pri&s;e, and invited him into a parlour.</P>
<P>"Having a few hours of lei&s;ure this morning," &s;aid Mental, throwing him&s;elf into a chair, and lean|ing on an oaken &s;taff, "I came to have &s;ome con|ver&s;ation with you. I am &s;orry that my vi&s;it is &s;o ill rimed. I really had no intention of breaking in up|on your hours of re&s;t; but my vulgar ideas had not a&s;&s;ociated going to bed with the &s;un in the meri|dian."</P>
<P>"You are &s;atirical," &s;aid George, endeavouring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o force a &s;mile.</P>
<P>"You are hypocritical," replied Mental.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Sir!" exclaimed Barnwell.</P>
<P>"He who attempts to put a &s;imper on his coun|tenance whil&s;t his heart aches with remor&s;e, is a hypocrite!" &s;aid Mental.</P>
<P>Barnwell's cheek glowed with the blu&s;h of &s;hame.</P>
<P>"Young man," continued Mental, "accident has brought us acquainted with each other. I love you, &s;incerely love you. I have wealth&mdash;I have no

Tell me, &s;incerely, where have you &s;pent the night&mdash;in who&s;e &s;ociety&mdash;in what pur&s;uit?"</P>
<P>"Spare me&mdash;&s;pare!" cried Barnwell.&mdash;"I have fallen &s;ufficiently in my own e&s;teem&mdash;Let me not for|feit your's!"</P>
<P><HI>"You,</HI> Mr. Barnwell, who po&s;&s;e&s;s faculties of no common magnitude, cannot have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o far de&s;cended from the dignity of a human creature, as to have &s;urrendered the di&s;tingui&s;hing powers of intellect to the grovelling plea&s;ures of the bottle?&mdash;You have not, I am &s;ure, devoted a whole night to inebriety!"</P>
<P>"No&mdash;no, indeed, I have not."</P>
<P>"Nor can I, for a moment &s;uppo&s;e you have yet &s;unk into the de&s;picable character of a game&s;ter!"</P>
<P>"Never&mdash;never," cried Barnwell, with warmth, "&s;hall you have to upbraid me with &s;o mean a vice!"</P>
<P>"There is but one conjecture more, then," &s;aid Mental, with peculiarly &s;atirical expre&s;&s;ion:&mdash;"but <HI>that</HI> would &s;carcely make you <HI>&s;ad!</HI> Be&s;ides, at your age&mdash;in this hot-bed of the pa&s;&s;ions, London&mdash;I pre|&s;ume cha&s;tity has long been relinqui&s;hed, as a vir|tue un&s;uited to the times in which you live;&mdash;an incumbrance, indeed, which young men of fa&s;hion mu&s;t not be &s;u&s;pected of retaining.&mdash;Long ere la&s;t night, therefore&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Forbear, I be&s;eech you, Sir!" &s;aid Barnwell; "you &s;trike a painful chord!&mdash;'Till la&s;t night I had not to upbraid my&s;elf with a crime, beyond all others ba&s;e&mdash;<HI>&s;eduction!"</HI>&mdash;</P>

"Hold&mdash;hold&mdash;hold!&mdash;if you would not have me cur&s;e you!" cried Mental.&mdash;"Do you not re|member," continued he, cla&s;ping his hands together, "that I once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an angel, till Seduction tore her from my arms!&mdash;that I had once a daughter!&mdash;that I abandoned her; and that <HI>&s;he,</HI> too, was &s;educed!&mdash;driven to infamy!&mdash;to death! And can you con|fe&s;s your&s;elf a Seducer! O, how often have I invok|ed eternal vengeance on the deliberate betrayer of confiding innocence!&mdash;Recal the odious charge, or you will become more loath&s;ome to my &s;ight than lepro&s;y. But it is impo&s;&s;ible! You a Seducer! It cannot be. The deliberate Seducer mu&s;t be a be|ing&mdash;allied to natures differing from human.

Such you cannot be!&mdash;But you are agitated&mdash;I &s;peak too warmly&mdash;My feelings mu&s;t excu&s;e for me."</P>
<P>Changing his voice and manner into the &s;ofte&s;t and mo&s;t gentle, he cea&s;ed not his importunities till he had obtained from Barnwell a relation of all that had pa&s;&s;ed betwixt him&s;elf and Milwood.</P>
<P>When he had heard the whole narrative&mdash;"'Tis a &s;trange tale!" cried he: "a very &s;trange &s;tory! But as you relate it, you charge your&s;elf with too large a &s;hare of blame. I have &s;trong doubts of this Milwood."</P>
<P>"O, Sir, you have not &s;een her&mdash;or her counte|nance would prevent &s;uch unde&s;erved &s;u&s;picion."</P>
<P>"You have promi&s;ed to &s;ee her again, of cour&s;e," &s;aid Mental.</P>
<P>"See her again!" echoed Barnwell:&mdash;"what tortures would be &s;evere enou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> for the wretch who could abandon her!"</P>
<P>"Do you mean to marry her, then?" &s;aid Mental.</P>
<P>Barnwell &s;tarted at the que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="038596_0140_10129F943B041FB0">
"Your uncle Sir James, your mother, your &s;i&s;ter, perhaps will &s;cruple to receive into their family a relation of &s;o my&s;terious a character!"</P>
<P>"You have taken me by &s;urpri&s;e, Sir," &s;aid Barnwell: "I have as yet determined upon nothing. My mind has not yet recovered from the emotions that have &s;o powerfully agitated it. I thank you &s;incerely for your generous concern; but I want reflection&mdash;I want to be alone!"</P>
<P>"I will leave you, then, to your&s;elf awhile; but I will not relinqui&s;h my claim to your confidence.

Adieu, youth, adieu!" and abruptly he departed.</P>
<P>Barnwell immediately retired to his chamber, and threw him&s;elf upon the bed. Overcome with want of &s;leep and anxiety of mind, he fell into a &s;lumber; but even in his &s;leep Milwood haunted his imagina|tion. He dreamt&mdash;'that he was &s;itting in the little temple dedicated to Retirement, in his father's gar|den, and that, from a window, he beheld a wide ex|pan&s;e of ground. His mother and Eliza were &s;it|ting near him, and he was reading to them Spence's Judgment of Hercules. After he had recited the poem, as he reclined his head on his arm, and mu&s;|ed upon the view before him, two female forms ap|peared, at a di&s;tance, re&s;embling in every re&s;pect tho&s;e de&s;cribed by the poet&mdash;

<L>"This &s;triking &s;acred awe&mdash;that &s;ofter, winning love."</L></Q></P>
<P>'As they drew nearer, a voice which &s;eemed to de&s;cend from above, proclaimed, that the trial was at hand which was to determine his future doom; and that his happine&s;s or mi&s;ery depended upon the choice of the pre&s;ent moment. The females contin|ued to advance, and he now beheld their counte|nances

di&s;tinctly, and immediately recogni&s;ed two well known faces&mdash;tho&s;e of Maria Freeman, and the &s;yren Milwood. The former &s;upported on one arm a bee-hive, on the top of which, linked by a golden chain, perched two turtle doves: her other arm re|clined upon a pede&s;tal of white marble, on which was in&s;cribed&mdash;"LOVE born of ESTEEM, and cher|i&s;hed by CONSTANCY:&mdash;PLEASURES the produce of INDUSTRY!"</P>
<P>'He was on the point of kneeling before the lovely vi&s;ion, when the other female &s;tepped gaily on, and placed her&s;elf before the pede&s;tal. Arrayed in a robe,

<P>'Her right hand held a chalice, into which drop|ped, unpre&s;&s;ed from a clu&s;ter of grapes &s;u&s;pended by her left, the intoxicating juice. Light as the mo|tion of the air &s;he danced awhile, and then, with graceful agility, &s;prung on a pede&s;tal of ruby, on which, in&s;cribed in golden letters, were the words&mdash;"LOVE, free as air!&mdash;PLEASURES &s;tolen from other's TOILS!"</P>
<P>'He quitted his mother and &s;i&s;ter, and de&s;cended into the plain. As he &s;tood wavering before the&s;e forms, his &s;oul, now &s;welled to virtuous atchieve|ments, by the maje&s;tic look and in&s;piring language of the one;&mdash;now &s;inking into wanton ea&s;e, be|neath the alluring glances and the &s;yren &s;ongs of the other. A chorus, in &s;ound like that which fills the vaults of heaven, from golden harps and angels voices, &s;truck his enamoured ear&mdash;

'As this chorus was &s;inging, the female, who re|&s;embled Milwood, &s;coffed by her &s;miles and ge&s;tures the warning voice, and in deri&s;ion flouri&s;hed her clu&s;ter of grapes in the air; whil&s;t the form that bore the countenance of Maria, rai&s;ed her fine blue eyes in calm and tranquil contemplation. He turn|ed his attention now wholly on the latter; and the more he gazed, the more lovely &s;he &s;eemed.&mdash;He was approaching re&s;pectfully to take her hand, when the Wanton de&s;cended from the pede&s;tal, and again intercepted&punc; him. She danced before him, and threw her&s;elf into the mo&s;t captivating attitudes&mdash;at intervals kneeling before him, and earne&s;tly entreat|ing him to accept the chalice, which &s;he held in her hand.</P>
<P>'As his mind wavered, and his eyes roved from one form to the other, he reflected on the chorus, and was &s;purning the importunate Wanton, when another chorus arre&s;ted his attention. It a&s;cended as from a vault beneath his feet, and was preceded by loud peals of laughter. It was accompanied by mu&s;ic, but of a different nature from the former: the notes were bri&s;ker, and louder, but wanted har|mony and &s;weetne&s;s. He li&s;tened, however, and this was the &s;train&mdash;
<Q><L>Can'&s;t thou, then, reject the fair?</L>
<L>Mark her mien! Her jetty hair</L>

<L>"Quickly through thy veins &s;hall flow</L>
<L>"Raptures none, but lovers, know!"</L></Q></P>
<P>'Whil&s;t he li&s;tened to this &s;ong, the &s;yren had wove her arms around his neck, and placed the cha|lice to his lips. He ta&s;ted the intoxicating draught!

&mdash;At that moment the &s;hrouded &s;hade of his fa|ther approached &s;olemnly from the temple, with his mother and Eliza in either hand.&mdash;As they pa&s;|&s;ed him, they looked on him with a countenance of deep felt pity, and walked on towards the pede&s;tal where the &s;emblance of Maria &s;till remained; but her appearance was changed: the emblems &s;he had held were vani&s;hed, and &s;he looked pale as a &s;pec|tre. As &s;oon as the group reached her, the pede&s;tal became changed into a &s;epulchre, which inclo&s;ed within its womb his father, his mother, and Maria, whil&s;t Eliza &s;tood weeping over the tomb as it &s;unk.</P>
<P>'He trembled, and exclaimed in agony&mdash;"O, Beauty, what a &s;acrifice have I made to thy charms!&mdash;Too powerful Beauty, what ha&s;t thou done!" As he &s;poke the&s;e words, he turned round to Milwood, whom he thought he addre&s;&s;ed, and found he was cla&s;ping a &s;keleton, which grinned horribly at his &s;urprize;&mdash;and &s;triking him with a lifted dart, occa&s;ioned him &s;o &s;evere a pain at his heart, that he awoke in inexpre&s;&s;ible horror.'</P>
<P>"Merciful Heaven, what a dream!" exclaimed he.&mdash;"My mother!&mdash;My &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;my &s;ainted fa|ther, too!&mdash;O, God! how &s;adly did they gaze up|on me!&mdash;What can &s;uch a vi&s;ion portend?

<P>Such was the &s;tate of mind in which Barnwell pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the day. He anxiou&s;ly look|ed forward to the hour they had appointed to meet, and, pleading indi&s;po&s;ition, remained in his chamber, mu&s;ing on the pro&s;pect before him, and endeavour|ing to mark out a &s;uitable cour&s;e to pur&s;ue.</P>

<P>Thunder&s;truck at &s;uch an unexpected proceed|ing, Barnwell was for &s;ome time incapable of deci|ding what &s;teps to take. While he he&s;itated, Mental entered the room&mdash;He &s;till held the letter in his hand&mdash;</P>
<P>"You are engaged?" &s;aid Mental.</P>
<P>"No, Sir&mdash;Yes, Sir&mdash;that is&mdash;I&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Well, Sir," cried Mental, "I'll not intrude. I may, perhaps, bring &s;tale news too. I have in|quired twice, to-day, in Berners Street. At fir&s;t the lady was not vi&s;ible; the &s;econd time, I learned that &s;he had taken po&s;t hor&s;es, and left town. You may po&s;&s;ibly know the route."</P>
<P>"No, Sir&mdash;Yes, Sir&mdash;" cried Barnwell, again he&s;itating</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid Mental&mdash;"how difficult does na|ture find the winding paths of mean di&s;&s;imulation! If you would retain your peace of mind&mdash;O, youth, retain &s;incerity!&mdash;And remember, that &s;hame or danger will prove as unwelcome at the end of a maze, as if boldly met at their fir&s;t appearance!"</P>
<P>Ere Barnwell could reply, Mental took his hand affectionately&mdash;"One caution let me impre&s;s upon your memory, and I am gone&mdash;Make no promi&s;es of &s;ecre&s;y!&mdash;Farewell."</P>
<P>Barnwell, had not the power, nor indeed, ju&s;t then, the inclination, to detain him; and he re|tired.</P>
<P>"He has called twice in Berners Street!" &s;aid Barnwell, after his departure. "Perhaps, then, Milwood may have imagined <HI>his</HI> inquiries to be her

uncle's. But why that caution as to promi&s;es of &s;ecre&s;y? Surely Milwood&mdash;But whil&s;t I am arguing, &s;he &s;pends the moments in anxious expec|tation!"</P>
<P>He ru&s;hed towards the door, and de&s;ired the man who waited, to conduct him to Milwood.&mdash;Immediate|ly they met, &s;he ran to him apparently in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s of mind, and hiding her face in his bo&s;om&mdash;"O, hide me&mdash;hide me, my dear Barnwell, from my pur&s;uers!"</P>
<P>"Di&s;pel the&s;e fears, Madam!" &s;aid Barnwell.&mdash;"Your alarms may be groundle&s;s&mdash;'Tis po&s;&s;ible you may have mi&s;taken the de&s;cription of another per|&s;on for your uncle."</P>
<P>"O, no!" cried Milwood&mdash;"I have <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">een</HI> him. He pur&s;ues me, and will tear me for ever from the&s;e loved arms!&mdash;O, how cruel&mdash;how peculiarly cruel is my de&s;tiny! Perhaps already he has traced my chai&s;e to this very door, and will &s;oon be here. Let us quit the hou&s;e!"</P>
<P>Barnwell, alarmed and greatly concerned for her di&s;tre&s;s, thought of nothing at the moment but re|lieving it. "Where will you be &s;afe?" exclaimed he.</P>
<P>"Alas! I know not!&mdash;But let us this moment quit this place&mdash;My trunks may be left here for the pre&s;ent&mdash;Come, come!"</P>
<P>She hurried on her cloak, and leaning on his arm, walked towards the door.&mdash;They had walked a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance from the hou&s;e ere Barnwell had &s;ufficiently recovered from the &s;urpri&s;e her conduct had occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>"I am faint!" cried Milwood. This arou&s;ed him; and being near the coach &s;tand at Hyde Park Gate, he called a hackney coach. When they were &s;eated&mdash;"Where am I to drive, your honour?" &s;aid the man.</P>
<P>Milwood leaning her head again&s;t the &s;ide of the coach, remained &s;ilent&mdash;Barnwell knew not how to an&s;wer. After a con&s;iderable pau&s;e&mdash;"The ca&s;e is

<P>The coachman obeyed&mdash;They &s;topped at a hou&s;e kept by a widow, and Barnwell hired the lodging at the rate of two guineas a week. Milwood, thus placed in a &s;afe retreat, as &s;he pretended, from her uncle, gradually rea&s;&s;umed her &s;erenity of countenance, and expre&s;&s;ed her gratitude to Barnwell in the warme&s;t language, and by the mo&s;t &s;educing endearments.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE pretended fears of Milwood, &s;o admirably played, completely an&s;wered the purpo&s;e for which &s;he had a&s;&s;umed them. Her penetration had ea&s;ily di&s;covered that Barnwell's mind, if time was allow|ed him for reflection, would too &s;crupulou&s;ly ex|amine the que&s;tion of propriety. She therefore artfully re&s;olved to take him by &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>The apartments in Berners Street &s;he had taken for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of their fir&s;t interview, where &s;he had re&s;ided but a few days, and had actually di&s;char|ged them in the manner &s;he had related. The &s;tory of her uncle's pur&s;uit was entirely a fiction. Her pre&s;ent aim was to obtain an habitation at the expence of Barnwell; and this, it is &s;een, &s;he accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Having thus far &s;ucceeded, a pau&s;e in her opera|tions was nece&s;&s;ary. She now, therefore, dallied with the unfortunate youth, who was the victim of her arts, and evaded all his inquiries as to her future de&s;igns. When an air of &s;adne&s;s marked his features, &s;he would &s;ing&mdash;when he hinted his wi&s;h that they were married, &s;he &s;ighed deeply, turned her head away from him, and talked on &s;ome different &s;ubject;
<PB N="149" REF="038596_0148_10129FAA63D30158">
when he &s;poke of his friends, &s;he affected the extre|me&s;t agitation; wept (for &s;he could weep at will,) and implored him, as he valued her life, to retain their connection an inviolable &s;ecret, for at lea&s;t &s;ome time to come.</P>
<P>Barnwell &s;tarted, as the caution of Mental, 'never to promi&s;e &s;ecre&s;y,' ru&s;hed acro&s;s his memory.&mdash;"Why, why &s;hould there be &s;ecre&s;y?" he exclaimed.</P>
<P>"Our fates have rendered it mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary," &s;he an&s;wered.&mdash;"Ah! Barnwell, you know not yet all the perplexities that rack this heart. Pardon the my&s;terious veil that for a moment conceals it, and confide in the a&s;&s;urance, that it is wholly and for|ever your's. 'Twere to be wi&s;hed, that <HI>we</HI>&mdash;yes, we (for I will not affect to throw the guilt whol|ly on you) had not yielded to the too powerful im|pul&s;e of our pa&s;&s;ions!&mdash;But, who can recal the pa&s;t? How u&s;ele&s;s, then, it is to repine! Let us, my dear Barnwell, rather conquer, then &s;ubmit to our fate, and employ our&s;elves in a prudent anticipation of the future, in preference to a gloomy retro&s;pect of the pa&s;t!"</P>
<P>Such were the blandi&s;hments with which the &s;yren &s;oothed the regrets of Barnwell, and &s;uch the arts by which &s;he bound him in unfelt &s;etters.</P>
<P>At his return home, the following morning, he &s;ound a packet of di&s;patches from his uncle's. Soon as he &s;aw the well known writing, his heart &s;mote him.</P>
<P>For &s;ome days previous to the unfortunate meet|ing with Milwood, accident had prevented his wri|ting to his &s;i&s;ter, with whom he had hitherto regu|larly corre&s;ponded, &s;ince his arrival in London; and the events which had occurred &s;ince then were &s;uch as he felt no inclination to relate. With the ju&s;t ap|prehen&s;ions of reproof, therefore, he broke the &s;eals, and read the following letters.</P>

Liberal as my uncle is, his genero&s;ity cannot equal wants of which he never dreams. Why did I make &s;o ra&s;h a promi&s;e! Why &s;hould &s;he exact it!&mdash;So contrary to my na|ture, to my practi&s;e too!&mdash;I hate, I abhor &s;ecre&s;y! 'Tis but another name for deception! I will fly in|&s;tantly, and retract my engagement. I will convince her how nece&s;&s;ary it is that our marriage &s;hould im|mediately take place, and be declared;&mdash;then, even if the anger of my benefactor &s;hould overpower his ten|derne&s;s and affection, I have the world before me&mdash;Indu&s;try &s;hall &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of nature; and the &s;weet reward of &s;incerity, my heart's approbation, &s;hall make ample amends for the luxuries I lo&s;e. But to continue the mean paths of di&s;&s;imulation&mdash;to &s;tart at every noi&s;e&mdash;to tremble at every glance&mdash;exi&s;ting under the uplifted rod of Fear, is wor&s;e, much wor&s;e, than any evil which can re&s;ult from an oppo&s;ite con|duct. This is the voice of prudence, of intere&s;t&mdash;and is in uni&s;on with the le&s;&s;ons of morality, and the precepts of religion.&mdash;I will obey it in&s;tantly."</P>
<P>Such were the inward mu&s;ings of Barnwell; &s;uch was the noble re&s;olution of his heart. As he was completely ma&s;ter of his own time in Mr. Emery's ab&s;ence, he an&s;wered &s;ome letters received that morn|ing from Buxton, and went immediately to Brompton.</P>

<P>"THIS is an unexpected plea&s;ure, indeed, my Barnwell," &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, as &s;he received him with a well-feign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of &s;atisfaction, though &s;he would gladly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> with his pre&s;ence; "how much I owe you for this endearing atten|tion!"</P>

<P>"By &s;o grave an addre&s;s, you terrify me!" cried &s;he, pretending exce&s;&s;ive alarm. "Tell me, my dear Barnwell, why are you &s;o &s;erious? Where are tho&s;e &s;miles that have gained &s;uch a triumph?"</P>
<P>"They are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, I hope, only for a time," &s;aid Barnwell. "It is in your power to recal them."</P>
<P>"O, &s;ay by what means?"</P>
<P>"Give me back my oath of &s;ecre&s;y, for I cannot be &s;ecret&mdash;it is contrary to my nature, and my heart will be never at ea&s;e till my countenance is at lib|erty."</P>

"Ab&s;urd!" &s;aid Milwood, with a &s;mile half &s;atire&punc; half &s;corn. "Are mankind, then, to walk the paths of &s;ociety with tran&s;parent brea&s;ts? Are we to give the world the clue of all our actions? Secrecy, my Barnwell, is a virtue of the fir&s;t cla&s;s in the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of things; and the being is as mad, who throws it a&s;ide, as he who ru&s;hes with a naked brea&s;t upon an ho&s;tile &s;pear! You are too unacquainted with a tricking world, my Barnwell. When you &s;hall know its wiles, how will you laugh at your pre&s;ent childi&s;h notions!"</P>
<P>"Then may I never know them! I cannot, and I will not be a hypocrite!"</P>
<P>Barnwell &s;poke this with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s, that Milwood trembled for its con&s;equences. Turning her powers, therefore, again&s;t this ri&s;ing &s;trength of re&s;olution, which alarmed her, &s;he bur&s;t into tears, and throwing her&s;elf into a chair&mdash;</P>
<P>"Go, then, proud youth; proclaim, through the wide circle of your friends, the triumph you have gained; di&s;play the &s;poil your conquering charms have won; exhibit my di&s;graoe; &s;ummon to my ears the &s;ongs of Scorn; and give to foul-mouthed Calumny the prey that you de&s;pi&s;e!"</P>
<P>"How wildly you talk, Madam!" cried Barnwell, &s;till &s;truggling to re&s;i&s;t the tender influence he felt.</P>
<P>"Madam!" echoed Milwood&mdash;"Madam!"</P>
<P>"Pardon me&mdash;my&mdash;what name&mdash;what title &s;hall I give you? Why will you not this moment give me a right to call you wife?"</P>
<P>"Merciful Heaven!" cried Milwood; "are you delirious? <HI>What can add</HI> to the right which <HI>I have</HI> granted you?&mdash;What mean you, then? Do you allude to the mummery invented for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who have not faculties of their own to define the laws of nature? Am I the le&s;s your's&mdash;are you the le&s;s your Milwood's becau&s;e a ceremony is omitted?"</P>
<P>"No, Milwood, no.&mdash;In my own e&s;timation, you are mine as &s;acredly as po&s;&s;ible. Have we not &s;worn a mutual faith in His pre&s;ence, who is every where! Our vows are regi&s;tered by Him&mdash;

<L>&mdash;"Who&s;e temple is all &s;pace,</L>
<L>Who&s;e altar, earth&mdash;&s;ea&mdash;&s;kies."</L></Q></P>
<P>"The &s;olemnity of an earthly temple, or the &s;anctity of temporal altars, therefore, cannot increa&s;e the force of obligation with a mind, that thinks as mine does! But O, Milwood! I am not a &s;olitary being&mdash;I have a mother, a &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e happine&s;s is wove with my own.&mdash;I have a benefactor, too, who&s;e generous kindne&s;s de&s;erves the warme&s;t gratitude! Can I tell them, that I&mdash;Could I introduce&mdash;."</P>
<P>"'Tis becau&s;e you can <HI>not</HI> do this, that I requi|red your &s;ecrecy."</P>
<P>"But, you will permit me to add, that if we had the &s;anction of Cu&s;tom (not to &s;ay the obligation of Law) to our connection, there would exi&s;t no cau&s;e of &s;ecrecy! Tho&s;e who love me will receive you as my wife; and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Surely, &s;urely you will not imagine my dear Barnwell, that from choice I throw an ob&s;tacle in the way of your propo&s;al;&mdash;it is impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould think &s;o!&mdash;but at pre&s;ent, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, we <HI>cannot</HI> marry!"</P>
<P>"What my&s;tery veils you, Milwood! O, ca&s;t it off. There cannot be a thought that, either of us &s;hould engro&s;s to our&s;elves: let me be&s;eech you to confide in me."</P>
<P>"Only for a little &s;pace of time, my Barnwell, &s;pare me. Soon &s;hall the veil, that now conceals my heart, for ever be removed:&mdash;then &s;hall our brea&s;ts be the common repo&s;itories of our mutual thoughts&mdash;there &s;hall not be a hope or a fear of one unknown to the other; but &s;o blended &s;hall become our very thoughts, we &s;hall together form but me exi&s;tence!"</P>
<P>"And why is that moment po&s;tponed?"</P>
<P>"You know not, my dear Barnwell, how you wound me by this u&s;ele&s;s importunity. I do not form my re&s;olutions on caprice, but on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> right or wrong I &s;ee before me; and therefore, I never change my purpo&s;e, but with the revolution of

exi&s;ting cau&s;es. I act from motives, not from im|pul&s;e; el&s;e I might, by your per&s;ua&s;ions, be moved to reveal a &s;ecret, that my rea&s;on now denies you. However much, therefore, your importunities may afflict my heart, they &s;hall not, they cannot, &s;ubdue the &s;overeign power of intellectual deci&s;ion!"</P>
<P>"Extraordinary woman!" cried Barnwell. "How, then, am I to act? Say, Milwood, had you a mo|ther and a &s;i&s;ter whom you loved, and to whom you had been accu&s;tomed to reveal your inmo&s;t thoughts, could you refrain from recounting &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> train of intere&s;ting events as have occurred to us within the&s;e few important days?"</P>
<P>"What can be more ea&s;ily decided than your que&s;tion? A&s;k your&s;elf, what benefit you can expect from revealing the&s;e events?&mdash;You would merely create an ho&s;t of painful apprehen&s;ions in tho&s;e brea&s;ts, which you wi&s;h &s;hould be the man&s;ions of peace; and the only po&s;&s;ible re&s;ult of their knowing what has pa&s;&s;ed, would be a painful anxiety to know more than it is at pre&s;ent in your power to reveal."</P>
<P>"And yet, to conceal the true &s;tate of my mind, I mu&s;t fein a &s;atisfaction I do not feel; I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume an indifference to which my heart is a &s;tranger. How can I an&s;wer &s;uch letters as the&s;e?"</P>
<P>Barnwell then gave her the three letters he had re|ceived in the morning.&mdash;When &s;he had peru&s;ed them&mdash;</P>
<P>"Your &s;i&s;ter is an amiable girl; and your mother is, doubtle&s;s, a good woman," &s;aid &s;he; "but I &s;carcely know how to pronounce on your uncle. His letters of prudence &s;eem more the acqui&s;itions of habit, than the &s;ugge&s;tions of his own rea&s;on. He is very rich, I pre&s;ume?"</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand &s;o."</P>
<P>"And as no children?"</P>
<P>"None."</P>
<P>"Your mother and &s;i&s;ter re&s;ide with him:&mdash;of cour&s;e to acquaint them with our connection, would be the &s;ame as informing your uncle."</P>
<P>"Does that follow?"</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="038596_0156_10129FC004F03C88">
"Yes; unle&s;s they can <HI>feign a &s;atisfaction they do not feel, and a&s;&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e an indifference to which their hearts are &s;trangers,</HI> you know!</P>
<P>Barnwell &s;miled.</P>
<P>"I perceive, my Barnwell," continued &s;he, "the &s;tate of your mind. It has hitherto been too much &s;wayed by prejudice early imbibed, and &s;till unexam|ined. But as you advance in life, you will di&s;cover, that the wi&s;e&s;t and the be&s;t of mankind find it im|po&s;&s;ible to model their actions by given rules. The incidents of life hinge &s;o entirely on chance, that our &s;ituations, relatively and individually, a&s;&s;ume many complex &s;hapes; and are perpetually at variance with defined notions of duty. 'Tis, therefore, im|po&s;&s;ible to exhibit a &s;tandard of virtue or vice.</P>
<P>"Let us apply this ob&s;ervation to your pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion:&mdash;You &s;ay you cannot be a hypocrite! I grant you, hypocri&s;y is cla&s;&s;ed among&s;t what are called vices; but will any one &s;ay, that to di&s;tre&s;s the feel|ings of a mother and &s;i&s;ter, to wound their hearts with the arrows of perplexing doubts and apprehen&s;ions, is more virtuous, than &s;imply to conceal the events which have pa&s;&s;ed, and which were not the effects of our own de&s;igns? Such a doctrine &s;carcely merits a moment's thought!"</P>
<P>By the&s;e and &s;imilar arguments, did this mi&s;tre&s;s of di&s;&s;imulation at length defeat the noble purpo&s;es of that &s;incerity which hitherto had dwelt in Barn|well's brea&s;t, and he fatally re&s;olved to keep his friends in ignorance of his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>In the hone&s;ty of his nature, he had confe&s;&s;ed to Milwood, that he had mentioned the affair to <HI>one</HI> friend, but that he was ignorant of any thing that had occurred &s;ince their &s;econd interview; and over|come by her tears, her arguments, and her per&s;ua|&s;ions, he promi&s;ed he would never allow him&s;elf to mention her again even to this <HI>one</HI> friend, nor would ever &s;uffer him to name her to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This was the preci&s;e point which the arts of Mil|wood aimed to accompli&s;h; for &s;he well knew that,
<PB N="158" REF="038596_0157_10129FC2DB7B1C48">
among the many and various errors to which youth and inexperience are expo&s;ed, there is none more fatal in its con&s;equences, than the concealment of having committed them. The fir&s;t deviating &s;teps from the paths of rectitude, may often be retraced by the aid of friendly council; but he who denies him&s;elf that timely aid, will in vain implore its ef|ficacy when entangled in the maze of deception; and when every avenue on the return to happine&s;s is ob&s;tructed by &s;ome unexpected ob&s;tacle.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THOUGH Barnwell's inclination led him to de|vote the whole of his lei&s;ure to the company of Mil|wood, re&s;pect to Mr. Emery pointed out the proprie|ty of a vi&s;it to the Pavilion, where he had lately be|come a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>'Twas a delightful evening in September, when, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince his acquaintance with Mil|wood, he arrived there. A period of ten or twelve days had elap&s;ed &s;ince his la&s;t vi&s;it, and he was fram|ing his apology as he walked his hor&s;e &s;lowly round the paling of the Park, and was near the Porter's Lodge, when he was arou&s;ed by the &s;weet notes of a guitar, i&s;&s;uing from the Park. When he alighted, as he gave his hor&s;e to the porter, he inquired who was the performer.</P>
<P>"'Tis one of the young ladies that be here on a vi&s;it," &s;aid the man. "I thinks they do call her Mi&s;s Freeman; but our young ladies do call her Maria&mdash;a &s;weet young lady &s;he is too! &s;he do a world of good wherever &s;he goes;&mdash;old and young

do pray for ble&s;&s;ings on her: and yet I be hugely out in my reck'ning and &s;he be'nt very unhappy!"</P>
<P>"Why do you think &s;o, Wilmot?" &s;aid Barnwell, who was intere&s;ted at his account.</P>
<P>"Why your honour, &s;he be &s;o mopi&s;h, and lone|&s;ome, and do never &s;eem to make merry with the gentlefolks; but walks, and walks, alone, all day; and then &s;he do &s;igh mightily&mdash;and be grown &s;o pale!&mdash;It is a main pity, your honour, that &s;he, who do take &s;uch pains to make every body happy, &s;hould not be happy her&s;elf!"</P>
<P>"Pity, indeed!" replied Barnwell, who encoura|ged his loquacity, that he might di&s;cover if any thing had occurred in his ab&s;ence&mdash;for old Wilmot had the talent of extracting from one or other of the dome&s;tics the whole news, of the Pavilion. One of the grooms having taken his hor&s;e, he followed Wil|mot into the Lodge, under pretence of admiring his grand-children&mdash;"What a fine fellow this!" &s;aid he, patting a chubby-faced little boy on the head;&mdash;"and tho&s;e are charming little girls!"</P>
<P>"I do thank heaven," cried the old man, "they be brave and hearty."</P>
<P>&mdash;"And only look, an' plea&s;e your honour," &s;aid the mother, "what <HI>beautiful fine</HI> dimity coats, and what <HI>lovely fine</HI> frocks the dear Mi&s;s Freeman has made for them, with her own hands!"</P>
<P>"Ah!" re&s;umed the old man, "&s;he is to be pitied, &s;weet lady!"</P>
<P>"Yes," cried his daughter; "if what Mrs. Wat&s;on, my lady's maid, &s;ays, be true, it is a hard ca&s;e for &s;uch a beautiful and lovely charming good angel to be cro&s;&s;ed in love!&mdash;for every body &s;ays it is love. Lord, I declare it makes one's heart ache to &s;ee her moping about, when all the re&s;t of the grand gentlefolks are riding out, or fi&s;hing, or dan|cing, or <HI>archering,</HI> or&mdash;"</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as &s;he was &s;peaking, Maria, ignorant of Barn|well's arrival, &s;trolled into the Lodge. Her eyes were thrown pen&s;ively upon the ground, her guitar
<PB N="160" REF="038596_0159_1012A0CA77640DC0">
hung on her arm. She appeared much changed in her countenance, and &s;ighed deeply &s;till. Barnwell could not behold her without a recollection of his dream. He &s;at in a corner of the little room, and Maria, lifting up her eyes, &s;aw him&mdash;</P>
<P>"Mr. Barnwell here!" exclaimed &s;he, with a mo|mentary blu&s;h that &s;uffu&s;ed her pale cheek. The &s;ur|pri&s;e appeared to have overcome her, and &s;he trembled.</P>
<P>"I am admiring Wilmot's grand-children," &s;aid Barnwell, with &s;ome he&s;itation.&mdash;"I have been&mdash;that is, I have been&mdash;I mean, it is a con&s;iderable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ince I have been here."</P>
<P>"How is the poor woman at farmer Ja&s;per's," &s;aid Maria to old Wilmot, appearing not to notice the too evident embarra&s;&s;ment of Barnwell.</P>
<P>"O, my &s;weet lady, &s;he be <HI>quite another gue&s;s</HI> thing; and &s;he do talk of nothing but her good angel. To|morrow &s;he do mean to pay you her re&s;pects, and re|turn thanks for&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Nay, nay," interrupted &s;he, "I mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hear you talk thus, good Wilmot:&mdash;but if the poor wo|man &s;hould come to-morrow, detain her here, and &s;end in for me. I charge you not to let her come into the hou&s;e;&mdash;her too grateful heart would pour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rth effu&s;ions I &s;hould be pained to hear in the pre|&s;ence of others.&mdash;Good evening"&mdash;and &s;he walked out of the Lodge. Barnwell followed her.</P>
<P>"Permit me to carry that in&s;trument," &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"No, Sir," replied Maria, coolly.</P>
<P>"You &s;eem fatigued&mdash;will you honor me by ac|cepting my arm?"</P>
<P>"No, Sir," replied &s;he again.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I &s;o unfortunate,' &s;aid Barnwell, "as to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Mi&s;s Freeman's di&s;plea&s;ure, that &s;he denies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the plea&s;ure of rendering her a&s;&s;i&s;tance?"</P>
<P>She walked on in &s;ilence. Barnwell was really concerned. He e&s;teemed Maria ere he felt the fer|vor of love, and valued her good opinion too highly to part with it with indifference. They reached the hou&s;e without exchanging another word.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="038596_0160_10122B2E36BC8320">
As they entered the &s;aloon, Mi&s;s Emery was play|ing a &s;erious air of Banti's on the piano, which &s;he immediately changed for&mdash;"<HI>See the conquering hero come!</HI>" which &s;he accompanied with her voice.&mdash;Mrs. Emery, Mi&s;s Charlotte, Lord Morley, and Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were pre&s;ent, and laughed &s;o heartily, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could not return the &s;alutations of Barnwell, or li&s;ten to one word of his apology. As &s;oon as &s;ilence returned, Charlotte opened the battery of raillery.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant, and renowned Conqueror of hearts, Colonel Commandant of the <HI>Corps</HI> of <HI>Cupids!</HI> who&s;e head-quarters are your brilliant eyes, who&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rtillery is your &s;miles, conde&s;cend to accept the congratula|tions of the meane&s;t of your captives, upon your &s;afe arrival, after &s;o long and painful an ab&s;ence!"</P>
<P>Barnwell was a&s;toni&s;hed!</P>
<P>"Sterling!&mdash;&s;terling!&mdash;upon my honour," cried Mr. Ea&s;twood; and the whole party, except Maria, joined in a mo&s;t hearty laugh.</P>
<P>"The annals of Love are but the records of your conque&s;ts," continued Charlotte, "and wherever we turn our wondering eyes, we view the victims of your charms!"</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;aid this, &s;he fixed her eyes &s;ignificantly upon Maria, who &s;eemed hurt by the allu&s;ion. Barn|well was no better plea&s;ed. Regardle&s;s, however, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the pain &s;he created, &s;o long as Mr. Ea&s;twood admi|red, and the others laughed, &s;he continued&mdash;</P>
<P>"But cea&s;e, mighty conqueror, cea&s;e this havoc among beauties; deign to con&s;ider the mi&s;ery you extend, and the woes you increa&s;e. Let the languid eyes, the pallid cheeks, the painful &s;ighs, the palpi|tating hearts of tho&s;e, who have already fallen, &s;uf|fice for &s;acrifices; check the cruel career of conque&s;t, and di&s;tribute the con&s;olation of your pre&s;ence more equitably among your &s;laves!

in ju&s;tice, as you do in &s;plendor, the equal revolutions of that glorious orb!"</P>
<P>Barnwell was petrified with a&s;toni&s;hment at this rhap&s;ody. He could not fail to under&s;tand her meaning, but was lo&s;t in wonder how his vi&s;its to Brompton could have reached the Pavilion.</P>
<P>"Come, come," cried Lord Morley, "be merciful, Charlotte, as you are powerful. You &s;ee how you make the poor youth blu&s;h!'</P>
<P>Barnwell was really embarra&s;&s;ed&mdash;"Upon my word," cried he, after &s;everal attempts, "you are very entertaining!"</P>
<P>"Do you think &s;o?" cried Charlotte archly. "Well, then, now I'll be &s;erious&mdash;quite in <HI>right ar|ne&s;t;</HI>" and drawing her&s;elf &s;tiffly upright in her chair, with her thumbs twirling round each other&mdash;"If you plea&s;e, Mr. Barnwell, how do you like the air at Brompton?

<P>Maria was looking earne&s;tly at her whil&s;t &s;he &s;poke. Barnwell beginning to apprehend &s;he really knew more than &s;he had yet hinted, found no way left but to return her raillery, however &s;everely he felt her ob&s;ervations&mdash;</P>
<P>"I think I have a right to call for an adjournment," &s;aid he, "as your proceedings are as irregular as un|ju&s;t. You &s;hould certainly have given notice of the mea&s;ure you intended to bring before the hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"Guilty&mdash;Guilty, upon my honour," cried Lord Morley; or he would never have evaded a trial upon a point of form."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Well," cried Barnwell, "I &s;uppo&s;e you under|&s;tand one another; but it is all cro&s;s purpo&s;es to me."</P>
<P>"O, I dare &s;ay you think them <HI>cro&s;s</HI> enough," cried Charlotte; "but if people will &s;et them&s;elves

<P>A bu&s;tle en&s;ued, during which, Barnwell, finding his &s;ervices u&s;ele&s;s, retired to his own room.</P>
<P>His own reflections were no more plea&s;ing than the railleries of Charlotte Emery. His connection with Milwood was evidently known at the Pavilion. It might al&s;o have reached the ears of his mother, and his uncle. Milwood her&s;elf was grown, if po&s;&s;ible, more my&s;terious. Her expences increa&s;ed rapidly, and his own finances became &s;traitened, notwith|&s;tanding his excellent management previous to his acquaintance with her. The di&s;dain of Maria, too, &s;at not ea&s;y on his heart: he knew her to be as ami|able in mind as lovely in per&s;on; and no longer doubt|ing but the report of a clande&s;tine connection had lo&s;t him her e&s;teem, if not a more tender regard; he mo&s;t bitterly lamented the fate, that prohibited his offering any explanation in ju&s;tification of his con|duct.</P>
<P>The long intervals betwixt the broken &s;lumbers of the night were, therefore, occupied in a train of thoughts, neither &s;atisfactory in a &s;urvey of the pa&s;t, nor in a contemplation of the future. Regret follow|ed, and Fear preceded him.</P>
<P>Nor was the brea&s;t of Maria tranquil. Her mind, endowed by nature with a quick &s;u&s;ceptibility of ten|der &s;entiments, had imbibed for Barnwell an affec|tion fatal to her peace. His per&s;on was hand&s;ome, his countenance intere&s;ting; but tho&s;e exteriors had little influenced the thinking Maria. 'Twas the na|tive elegance of his manners, the integrity and gene|ro&s;ity of his &s;entiments, and the noble tenor of his conduct, that had gained him &s;o honorable a di&s;tinc|tion in her bo&s;om. This di&s;tinction had increa&s;ed continually by a compari&s;on with the young men who vi&s;ited Mr. Emery.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="038596_0163_10129FCE4E767038">
Among the &s;warm of fa&s;hionable flies that buzzed perpetually about her, &s;he &s;ought in vain for his ori|ginality of mind, his purity of thought. One was con&s;picuous for his di&s;gu&s;ting rudene&s;s, practi&s;ed by mi&s;take for affability; others, for an equally di&s;gu&s;t|ing ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, that &s;et all appreciation of their minds at complete defiance: this entertained her with the hi&s;tory of the theatres, and retailed the &s;candal of venomous tongues to the prejudice of the per|formers; whil&s;t others, could &s;he have li&s;tened to them, would have taught her the whole art of farri|ery, and &s;tored her mind with the true principles of <HI>nicking, docking, cropping,</HI> and <HI>training hor&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>But when opportunity favored her with the &s;ociety of Barnwell, <HI>her</HI> mind expanded in the pur&s;uit of <HI>his</HI> ideas <HI>her</HI> heart glowed at the congenial effu&s;ions of <HI>his;</HI> and &s;he felt at once delighted and improved. Such a di&s;tingui&s;hing e&s;teem naturally, though imper|ceptibly &s;oftened into Love; and Maria was &s;urpri|&s;ed at her own &s;ituation when &s;he fir&s;t di&s;covered how nece&s;&s;ary was the pre&s;ence of Barnwell to the &s;atisfaction of her heart.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery &s;he made, when, day after day, he ab&s;ented him&s;elf for above a week from the Pavilion; which, all gaiety as it was, appeared in the e&s;tima|tion of Maria the very temple of Dullne&s;s, without the &s;ociety of Barnwell. But if a doubt was left on her mind re&s;pecting the &s;tate of her heart, it vani&s;h|ed at the pain, the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite pain, &s;he endured, when through the tattle of &s;ervants, (which Barnwell never &s;u&s;pected) his nightly vi&s;its to Brompton were made known at the Pavilion.</P>
<P>Then did the bo&s;om of Maria &s;well with angui&s;h, unfelt before. She doubted, &s;he &s;crupled to believe, that Barnwell would be guilty of intrigue; and yet there was no way of acquitting him, but by &s;uppo&s;ing he had entered into more &s;olemn, and la&s;ting engage|ments. Either &s;uppo&s;ition wounded her heart. She grew melancholy and thoughtful; and the &s;truggle of her rea&s;on and her love &s;apped the foundations of her health.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="038596_0164_10129FD2BA0D1580">
Such was the &s;ituation of Maria, when the beha|viour of Barnwell in the &s;aloon confirmed her in the opinion that, if ever he had been worthy of her e&s;teem, he had now relinqui&s;hed that claim. The angui&s;h &s;uch conviction occa&s;ioned her, was too pow|erful for her delicate mind, and was the cau&s;e of her fainting.</P>
<P>With Maria therefore, as well as with Barnwell, the night pa&s;&s;ed heavily on; and when the glorious orb of day cha&s;ed darkne&s;s from the earth, neither Barnwell nor Maria could hail, with a tranquil brea&s;t, tho&s;e gladdening beams, that heretofore had kindled in their hearts the glow of grateful joy.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A POSTCHAISE and four was at the door when Barnwell arrived, the following morning, at Portland Place. Mr. Emery had ju&s;t returned from Buxton. He immediately paid his re&s;pects to him in the li|brary.&mdash;</P>
<P>"So Barnwell!" &s;aid Mr. Emery, as he walked ha&s;tily about the room:&mdash;his eyes were red and &s;well|ed&mdash;his a&s;pect lowering&mdash;his brows knitted&mdash;not one trace was left in his countenance of his former ea&s;e and gaiety.</P>
<P>Barnwell was he&s;itating whether to retire or re|main; when Mr. Emery, putting his hand to his head, exclaimed&mdash;</P>
<P>"What an infernal crew!&mdash;What devils upon earth!&mdash;Blood-&s;uckers that feed upon the vitals of their fellows!&mdash;Cur&s;e them!&mdash;cur&s;e them!" Then

turning &s;uddenly round&mdash;"What are you &s;taring at?" cried he to Barnwell.&mdash;"Did I &s;end for you? Go&mdash;Stay&mdash;Where's my wife?"</P>
<P>"At the Pavilion, Sir."</P>
<P>"<HI>Pavilion!</HI> Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!&mdash;"'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been &s;lave to thou&s;ands!"</P>
<P>There was a wildne&s;s, approaching to madne&s;s, in the manner and words of Mr. Emery, that &s;truck Barnwell with &s;urpri&s;e and horror; yet, ignorant of the cau&s;e, he was unable to offer con&s;olation to his de&s;pair, had his &s;ituation allowed him the privilege. After two or three paces round the room&mdash;"Write me a note," cried Mr. Emery, with a quickne&s;s that &s;tartled him. Barnwell li&s;tened to his indicting&mdash;</P>
<P>"Mr. Emery will e&s;teem him&s;elf highly obliged, if Mr. Negotiate will call in Portland Place, as early this morning as po&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>"Take this no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e your&s;elf:&mdash;&s;ee Negotiate, and know the exact minute he will be here."</P>
<P>Barnwell obeyed his orders with promptne&s;s, and returned with intelligence, that Mr. Negotiate was ju&s;t &s;tepping into his chariot, to fulfil an appointment at the Trea&s;ury, and would wait on Mr. Emery as he returned.</P>
<P>Mr. Negotiate was a money-broker; a man &s;up|po&s;ed to be immen&s;ely rich; who, from the facility with which he could convert remote &s;ecurities into ready ca&s;h, was a nece&s;&s;ary confidante of the needy, both at Court and 'Change. He was a little thin man, and always &s;eemed ready to &s;ink <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the weight of Exchequer bills, Scrip receipts, and money bonds, with which his pockets were continually load|ed. He was pompous and proud to tho&s;e who want|ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; ob&s;equious and meanly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive where <HI>he</HI> wanted a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>About one he arrived. Barnwell was withdraw|ing when he entered the library&mdash;"Stay;" &s;aid Mr. Emery, "we mu&s;t have a witne&s;s; and you who al|ready half know my embarra&s;&s;ments, may as well know the whole."</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="038596_0166_10129FD86C5D4CC0">
"There, now," cried Negotiate, who was a Jew, "I vas thought as much.&mdash;Embarra&s;hment, embar|ra&s;hment!&mdash;Every body <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> out that tone, Em|barra&s;hment.

<P>"Why, for the pre&s;ent," &s;aid Mr. Emery, "&s;ix thou&s;and will do."</P>
<P>"Got Almighty! Vere vas you think I can &s;crape &s;o much money? 'Ti&s;h impo&s;&s;ible! Good morning, Mi&s;hter Emery&mdash;Good morning&mdash;You mu&s;t inquire furder.

<P>"D&mdash;the market! cried Emery, furiou&s;ly. "I mu&s;t&mdash;I will have the money!"</P>
<P>"Marcy on us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">varm you grow! Be quiet! be ea&s;y! be calm!"</P>
<P>Negotiate always made it a point to refu&s;e in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, that, by the effects of di&s;appointment upon his victim, he might judge of their emergency, and offer terms accordingly. After a variety of dif|ficulties were, at length, di&s;patched, he advanced the &s;um required, upon the &s;ecurity of the e&s;tate at the Pavilion, at an enormous premium, and on a bond to reimbur&s;e &s;tock to the amount &s;old out, be the price at its expiration ever &s;o di&s;proportionate.</P>
<P>This tran&s;action opened a new &s;cene to Barnwell, and filled his mind with the mo&s;t &s;erious reflections, in which the peril of his own &s;ituation was not for|gotten. Every hour it grew more dangerous. A clande&s;tine connection with a per&s;on, of who&s;e fami|ly or friends he could procure no &s;ort of intelligence, who&s;e &s;tory was my&s;terious, and in &s;everal points

<P>There is &s;omething wrong, my dear Brother: you are unhappy, and you have rendered us &s;o too! What a letter was your la&s;t&mdash;'<HI>Engagements of vari|ous kinds!&mdash;Particular circum&s;tances!&mdash;Want of tim!</HI>&mdash;What excu&s;es are the&s;e from one, who had u&s;ed to delight in recounting every little incident that might entertain; every thought that might improve his &s;i&s;|ter! Did I fancy it, or was your hand, indeed, un|&s;teady while you wrote? O, George, you are a &s;orry actor! In vain you aim to fit a ma&s;k upon your &s;oul: it &s;purns it, and will bur&s;t the fetters of deception. It mu&s;t not be concealed, that we concluded from the incoherencies, the contradictions of your letters, that &s;omething is wrong; and the anxiety as to the nature of the evil, is greater, beyond all compari&s;on, than a certain knowledge of it, be i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> what it may. Leave us no longer, then, in the purgatory of conjecture. <HI>'Engagements,'</HI> you &s;peak of. It <HI>was</HI> your cu&s;tom to de&s;cribe to us the events of every day. What then is the nature of tho&s;e engagements you keep back from our knowledge? Your &s;ituation mu&s;t be changed, indeed, if pre&s;s of <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> has &s;o quickly &s;ucceeded a <HI>lei&s;ure,</HI> of which you formerly complained! Ah, George, that lei&s;ure, in &s;uch a place as London, ever occa&s;ioned our dear parent &s;ome concern for you. But when we found it devoted to the improvement of mind, to the elegant pur&s;uits of literature, and parti|cularly when &s;pontaneou&s;ly you devoted &s;o large a portion of it to a corre&s;pondence, that brought us, as it were, daily into each other's pre&s;ence, her heart glowed with gratitude to the memory of him, who is now no more, as &s;he hailed with joy the &s;weet blo&s;|&s;oms of his early cultivation.</P>
<P>Shall we then be deceived at la&s;t! Say, my bro|ther, were tho&s;e blo&s;&s;oms &s;o tender, that Temptation's tempe&s;t can have blighted them? Forgive the

thought! It cannot&mdash;can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be! It may have check|ed them; it cannot have de&s;troyed them. Some in|di&s;cretion has, for a while, &s;hed its &s;ombre influence over a mind, that cannot be at once in error, and at ea&s;e. Is it &s;o, my dear brother? I have a right to pre&s;ume it is, from your conduct; for on no other ground can I define it. And if it &s;hould be &s;o, what have we ever done, that our hearts are denied their ju&s;t right to a knowledge of your imperfections? How often have the imperfections of human nature been our theme! How often have we pitied the poor di&s;ciples of modern philo&s;ophy, who boa&s;t the re|ver&s;e. We have heard per&s;ons declare, that they have never repented of one act of their lives, and we have &s;miled. It mu&s;t be fal&s;e &s;hame, or fal&s;e fear, then, that has betrayed my dear brother into the con|cealment of his errors.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may imagine, that to acquaint us with them, would occa&s;ion us pain; and that what we do not know, we cannot regret. Fatal delu&s;ion! How many wrecks of promi&s;ed happine&s;s has that rock occa&s;ioned! Mo&s;t, who opproach it, peri&s;h. Examine this &s;pecious &s;ugge&s;tion of Pride&mdash;It is no more. We are unwilling to de&s;cend in the e&s;teem of tho&s;e we love, and we conceal from their knowledge indi&s;cretions, which we imagine would have that ef|fect; forgetting that, by the very concealment, we practi&s;e a crime, in&s;tead of committing an error; and are guilty of the meane&s;t hypocri&s;y, in pa&s;&s;ing our|&s;elves upon our friends for &s;uch miracles of perfec|tion, as make a compari&s;on with their own experi|ence, painful. Be&s;ides the meanne&s;s of this decep|tion, it will be found impolitic. It is the unvarying law of nature, that all cau&s;es produce effects. Indi&s;|cretion, then, mu&s;t have its con&s;equences. And how frequently is it &s;een, that the con&s;equences declare the indi&s;cretion to tho&s;e, from whom we have &s;ought to conceal it! and then how contemptible do we ap|pear, from the very act, which we vainly imagined the prop of our characters!</P>

mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts had been ever open, Barnwell again bent his foot&s;teps towards Brompton.</P>

<P>Mrs. Griffiths had, about five months &s;ince decent|ly interred the <HI>poor dear &s;oul,</HI> her &s;econd hu&s;band, who had been pa&s;tor of a di&s;&s;enting congregation.

The patience of Barnwell, was, by this time, com|pletely exhau&s;ted; and he was ri&s;ing to depart, when Mrs. Griffiths prevented him.</P>
<P>"But now, Sir, I <HI>comes</HI> to what I was agoing to re|mark to you. You &s;ee how I am <HI>&s;ittyated;</HI> and that I am not able to afford to loo&s;e by my lodgers. To be &s;ure, the church does allow me a paltry twenty pounds a year; but that's no dependence, as I don't go to their place, and, indeed, don't much like their pray|ers without books, where one don't know what they're agoing to &s;ay. Be&s;ides, if I &s;hould alter my condi|tion again, which there's no telling, I dare &s;ay they'd take it off: and &s;o, what I &s;ay is&mdash;its my own <HI>look-out</HI> I mu&s;t depend on; and I can't afford to lo&s;e."&mdash;</P>
<P>"I don't under&s;tand, Madam, what all this leads to," cried Barnwell, interrupting her. "You are very regularly paid, and well paid."</P>
<P>"As to that, two guineas a week for what this Mrs. God-knows-who has, its little enough."</P>
<P>"More re&s;pect, if you plea&s;e, when you mention that lady!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I doesn't mean to affront you, Sir; but I mu&s;t look after my own. To be &s;ure, you have paid re|gular enough as yet; and &s;o did the gentleman, at fir&s;t, that I lo&s;t&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Mrs. Griffiths," &s;aid Barnwell, extremely vexed, and taking his hat in his hand&mdash;"if you have any thing to &s;ay that concerns <HI>me,</HI> pray &s;ay it at once; but if you are going to begin any more &s;tories, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me."</P>
<P>"Why then, Sir, if you are for being &s;o blunt&mdash;pray, who are you, and what are you? When you took my lodgings, it was all in a hurry, as I may &s;ay, and I went upon your appearance; but it is my wi&s;h now to have a proper reference for your cha|racter. I have particular rea&s;ons for it!"</P>
<P>"Barnwell &s;tarted involuntarily, and blu&s;hed&mdash;"What rea&s;ons?" exclaimed he.</P>

<P>"As briefly as you can," cried Barnwell.</P>
<P>She then related that&mdash;"this morning, as &s;he was &s;itting at the window, &s;he noticed an old gentleman, plainly dre&s;&s;ed, who walked three or four times pa&s;t the hou&s;e with particular ob&s;ervation. At length he bowed to her, and knocked at the door. Upon be|ing &s;hewn into the parlour, he bluntly a&s;ked her, if &s;he let lodgings; and then as abruptly de&s;ired to know the name of her pre&s;ent tenants. When &s;he informed him, Barnwell&mdash;he exclaimed&mdash;'Then I am right. Is the lady within who accompanied Mr. Barnwell here?' "Upon finding he knew the circum|&s;tance," continued Mrs. Griffiths, "I an&s;wered, yes. He then de&s;ired to &s;ee her. I went up &s;tairs, and told the lady; but &s;he refu&s;ed to &s;ee him unle&s;s he came with any me&s;&s;age from your&s;elf. The old gen|tleman was too &s;crupulous to tell a &s;tory; but &s;ent up word&mdash;He did not come with your knowledge, but that he came as your friend; and only wi&s;hed to intrude upon her time five minutes. But &s;he po&s;itive|ly refu&s;ed him. 'This looks ill!' &s;aid the old gen|tleman; and he &s;at talking to him&s;elf a good while.&mdash;'I &s;hould like too &s;ee this lady,' &s;aid he, 'even if I did not &s;peak to her. Could you manage this for me?' I told him, that &s;he generally walked in the gar|den in the cour&s;e of the morning; and that, if he plea&s;ed, he might &s;top and &s;ee her pa&s;s the windows of the back parlour. He did &s;o; and we talked of you, Sir. He acquainted me, that this lady was one of tho&s;e <HI>de&s;picable</HI> hu&s;&s;ies, that ought, in my opinion, to be burnt alive; and that you was going to ruin head|long; and that it was ten to one if you was able to pay <HI>me,</HI> for that you was only a <HI>marchant's</HI> clerk."</P>
<P>"<HI>He</HI> told you this?&mdash;<HI>He</HI> &s;ay this of me?&mdash;Im|po&s;&s;ible!" cried Barnwell; for he in&s;tantly conclu|ded it could be no other than Mental.</P>

"Yes, but he did; and much more he would have &s;aid, had not the lady ju&s;t then pa&s;&s;ed the window. She turned round to pluck a flower, and &s;o he had a full view of her face.

<P>"This is all very extraordinary," cried Barnwell&mdash;"very extraordinary, indeed!&mdash;Pray, have you acquainted the lady with this circum&s;tance?"</P>
<P>"No, not I, Sir.

<P>"Barnwell, at once di&s;gu&s;ted, vexed, and &s;urpri&s;ed, left her without a word, and &s;ought Milwood. She met him as he entered the room&mdash;</P>
<P>"Why, my dear Barnwell, is your brow thus con|&s;tantly clouded?"</P>
<P>He an&s;wered not, but throwing him&s;elf on the &s;ofa&mdash;</P>
<P>"I &s;hall never be happy again," murmured he "O! Milwood, what a wretch have you made me! I was ba&s;king in bli&s;s&mdash;I knew not a painful reflection&mdash;and now, I can neither con&s;ult my friends, nor my own heart&mdash;I have grown de&s;picable in the e&s;tima|tion of both!&mdash;You have de&s;troyed my tranquillity for ever!"</P>
<P>"From you this language, Barnwell!&mdash;From you, for whom I have &s;acrificed not only friends, but for|tune&mdash;nay, for whom I have &s;acrificed the delicacy of my &s;ex&mdash;and have incurred a &s;hame never to be effaced!&mdash;Who is mo&s;t the &s;ufferer, Barnwell&mdash;you, who have &s;hared equally in all the plea&s;ures of our connection, and, in the world's opinion, have ob|tained a triumph&mdash;or I, who, for my portion of rap|turous moments have to encounter the evils of years, unborn?&mdash;Yet will I never repine&mdash;I, who am a woman, will yet be philo&s;opher enough, not to la|ment the price of my plea&s;ure!&mdash;No, my Barnwell," throwing her arms round his neck&mdash;"no!&mdash;though

<P>"At the my&s;tery which encircles her I love!" &s;aid Barnwell;&mdash;"at the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ecre&s;y, which I ab|hor!

<P>"I under&s;tand you, Barnwell&mdash;I perfectly under|&s;tand you; and would to God that ob&s;tacles, in&s;ur|mountable ob&s;tacles, did not prevent our adoption of tho&s;e means. But, once for all&mdash;know, that the &s;tep, to which you allude, is&mdash;quite impo&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;Milwood, do I hear you rightly&mdash;Impo&s;&s;ible?"</P>
<P>Milwood wept, and &s;ighed.</P>
<P>"Tell me, mo&s;t my&s;terious woman, and, by one word, for ever &s;eal my doom&mdash;Are you already married?"</P>
<P>Milwood remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Nay, an&s;wer me, I be&s;eech you," continued Barnwell. "The certainty that it is &s;o cannot be more tormenting than this &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Tell me, then, at once, how guilty and how mi&s;erable a wretch I am."</P>
<P>"O, Barnwell!&mdash;thy cruel penetration has woun|ded my &s;oul!&mdash;I am&mdash;nay, &s;tart not, fly not from me&mdash;I am&mdash;already&mdash;married!&mdash;"</P>
<P>Barnwell, in an agony, bur&s;t from her arms, and ru&s;hed towards the door. He had &s;eized the handle of the lock, when, with a &s;hriek, Milwood fainted on the &s;afa. His tenderne&s;s returned in an in&s;tant, as he &s;aw her beauteous per&s;on extended lifele&s;s on the &s;ofa. He rang the bell violently; Mrs. Griffiths and her &s;ervant came up, and he a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in their &s;ervices. Half opening her eyes, the artful Milwood ob&s;erved his attentions&mdash;</P>
<P>"He has left me&mdash;he is gone&mdash;he is gone for

ever!" exclaimed &s;he. Then appearing to recover, and &s;tarting at the &s;ight of him, &s;he caught his hand, and ki&s;&s;ing it rapturou&s;ly&mdash;"O, this is god-like, indeed!" &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>Barnwell, finding &s;he recovered, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the landlady and her &s;ervant, and tenderly &s;upported her in his own arms. He could not, however, &s;o far di&s;gui&s;e his feelings, as to appear otherwi&s;e than of|fended.</P>
<P>"Ah! why was this cruelty exerted!" &s;aid &s;he&mdash;"why have you &s;aved me from death, if thus you gaze on me!&mdash;Never! never can I bear tho&s;e reprov|ing eyes!&mdash;Never can I &s;upport your anger, Barnwell. This &s;cornful &s;ilence too! The bitter reproaches were kinder than this cold &s;ilence, Barnwell!"</P>
<P>"What can I &s;ay to thee, thou dangerous woman?&mdash;You, Milwood, may deem adultery no crime; but I&mdash;."</P>
<P>"<HI>You,</HI> Barnwell, are no adulterer&mdash;you are in|nocent&mdash;I, indeed, am guilty!&mdash;But the love I cheri&s;h for you is all my heart approves.&mdash;Com|pelled to marry another, I have vowed at the altar to be his; but never have tho&s;e vows been &s;anction|ed by my heart&mdash;they were tortured from my lips&mdash;but never has my per&s;on yielded to &s;uch legalized pollution. From that memorable day I became a fugitive, and only approached the altar with that view. A pri&s;oner, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, I had no other alternative, than to yield my hand to a loathed bridegroom, whom, from that hour to this, I never have beheld."</P>
<P>Barnwell &s;at &s;ilently mu&s;ing on the &s;ofa; his hands were folded in each other, and his eyes fixed on the floor.</P>
<P>"Still you are &s;ilent, Barnwell. I &s;ee the ri&s;ing &s;corn, that &s;its upon your lips; I know the innate delicacy of your pure mind revolts at the de&s;perate actions of a phren&s;y &s;tricken woman, whom cruel tyranny and unbounded love unite to plunge into de&s;pair. I will not aim to le&s;&s;en your di&s;gu&s;t; it is
<PB N="178" REF="038596_0177_10129FF75C7E5F60">
the only remedy for my ill-fated pa&s;&s;ion. Go then, too lovely youth; go, and forget for ever, the lo&s;t&mdash;lo&s;t Milwood!&mdash;Go, and in &s;ome other's arms, be ble&s;t!&mdash;while I, in a lone corner of the earth, mourn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">'er thy memory, and ble&s;s thy name."</P>
<P>"Yes, Madam," cried Barnwell; &s;tarting from his reverie&mdash;"I perceive no other mode of action:&mdash;there appears one only outlet from this &s;ea of guilty plea&s;ures;&mdash;where, longer to remain, mu&s;t be de|&s;truction!"</P>
<P>"I know your dreadful meaning, Sir:&mdash;'Tis cru|el, but 'tis nece&s;&s;ary. We mu&s;t part; and, &s;ince I have become &s;o loath&s;ome to your &s;ight, the rude&s;t de&s;arts will be preferable to your pre&s;ence. No&mdash;I could never &s;tay to be de&s;pi&s;ed by you!"&mdash;</P>
<P>Here the &s;yren &s;hed a flood of artificial tears, that tortured Barnwell to the very &s;oul. The extreme &s;en&s;ibility of his nature &s;ubjected him to extremes in &s;entiment: now, mo&s;t tenderly he pitied the mi&s;eries of Milwood; then, the memory of his family ru&s;hed acro&s;s his mind&mdash;he &s;aw their indignant frowns, he heard their rebukes, for a conduct &s;o unworthy of them, and of him&s;elf. Again, when he reflected on the dreadful fate of her, who had abandoned &s;o much for his &s;ake, he was ready to extend his hand, and vow eternal truth. Again, the taunts of the world, the revenge of an injured hu&s;band, and the ignominy to him&s;elf and friends, of a public accu&s;ation, check|ed the &s;oftne&s;s quivering on his lips, which only e&s;ca|ped by a painful &s;igh.&mdash;</P>
<P>In this conflict of his mind, memory placed before him the vi&s;ion he had &s;een in his &s;leep: he felt the allu&s;ion of the &s;cene mo&s;t &s;trongly; the very counte|nance of his father was pre&s;ent, and &s;ummoned a re|&s;olution in his brea&s;t, that conquered every oppo&s;ition. Approaching the &s;ofa with tremulous voice&mdash;</P>
<P>"Painful to me, Milwood, are tho&s;e tears; but, after the knowledge I have obtained of your &s;ituation, to continue a connection&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I know it mu&s;t not be," interrupted &s;he:&mdash;"I

know the jaundiced eye of prejudice views in it all the hideous colorings of vice! I a&s;k it not, my Barn|well&mdash;heart-breaking is the &s;acrifice; but to your peace of mind, I will &s;urrender, even your&s;elf! Yet, do not add to the horrors of &s;uch a &s;eparation, by in|flicting the mi&s;ery of thinking that I am de&s;pi&s;ed by you. Say that you do not hate me; and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Hate you!&mdash;O, Milwood&mdash;have I not preferred you, even to virtue? And now, if you knew the &s;trug|gle of my heart, you would &s;ee it is impo&s;&s;ible to hate you!"</P>
<P>"Generous&mdash;generous Barnwell!&mdash;why &s;hould the cold and rigid arbitration of an ill-judging world &s;ever &s;uch hearts as ours!"</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke, &s;he twined her arms around his neck; her palpitating heart beat again&s;t his bo&s;om, and her warm ki&s;&s;es brought on a delirium of ec&s;ta&s;y.</P>
<P>At this moment the door opened, and three men, in ma&s;ks, ru&s;hed into the room. Milwood &s;hrieked and fainted. Two of the&s;e intruders held Barnwell on the &s;ofa, and prevented his cries; whil&s;t the other conveyed Milwood away in his arms.</P>
<P>Barnwell in vain exerted him&s;elf again&s;t &s;uperior &s;trength, as no per&s;on came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In about ten minutes the third man returned, and beckoned the other to follow him. They left Barnwell gagged and bound. A con&s;iderable time elap&s;ed before Mrs. Griffiths and her &s;ervant made their appearance, crying and lamenting mo&s;t bitterly, having under|gone the &s;ame treatment as Barnwell.</P>
<P>When they had relea&s;ed him, he raved with the fury of a maniac; impeached the integrity of the poor women, who &s;tood trembling at his anger; and gave the reins to the pa&s;&s;ions of jealou&s;y and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>The &s;trength of his unhappy attachment, was at no period &s;o vi&s;ible as now. The uncertainty of her fate, the tormenting apprehen&s;ions he felt for her &s;afe|ty, engro&s;&s;ed his whole &s;oul.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e being &s;ituated at a di&s;tance from any other, he could obtain no intelligence by inquiries.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="038596_0179_10129FFE9F4055F0">
Having, after a con&s;iderable time, &s;omewhat ex|hau&s;ted the fir&s;t and violent bur&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion, he be|gan to li&s;ten to the rea&s;onings of Mrs. Griffiths; and the only probable conclu&s;ion that he could draw, was, that the old gentleman, who had been there in the morning, and was &s;o de&s;irous of &s;eeing Milwood, and who, he had &s;uppo&s;ed, was Mental, mu&s;t have been her uncle, who had taken this method of carrying her off to her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>As his pre&s;ent &s;tate of mind prevented his return|ing immediately to Mr. Emery's, he remained &s;ome hours at Brompton, contemplating what &s;teps to pur|&s;ue. The &s;ugge&s;tion that be&s;t plea&s;ed him, of the many that pre&s;ented them&s;elves, was, to &s;eek out Mental, relate to him all that had happened, and be guided by his opinion.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he was preparing to put this re&s;olution in practice, a boy delivered a letter at the door, addre&s;&s;|ed to Barnwell, and which he &s;aid had been given him by a man, who directed him to the hou&s;e, and then ran away.</P>

"Never, never," exclaimed he, as he paced the room with the letter in his hand&mdash;"never could my hand be firm enough to write them &s;uch intelligence.

the preceding day, which he gathered from the &s;ervants, who were packing and cording trunks for a journey. Mr. Emery him&s;elf had ri&s;en early, and encountered Barnwell in the Hall. There were no traces of unea&s;ine&s;s now to be ob&s;erved in his coun|tenance, and Barnwell was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;o &s;udden a return of his former gaiety.</P>
<P>"We're going to Ram&s;gate," &s;aid Mr. Emery, "and Mrs. Emery in&s;i&s;ts upon your accompanying us. Indeed I wi&s;h it my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Barnwell was thunder&s;truck&mdash;"Ram&s;gate, Sir!&mdash;I really am not prepared. If I might be excu&s;ed&mdash;"</P>
<P>O, by no means; any thing you may have occa|&s;ion for can be &s;ent after you. The plan is arrang|ed;&mdash;you are to drive Mi&s;s Freeman in the curricle; and there will be three or four other carriages. We breakfa&s;t early. The carriages are ordered at eleven. You'll be ready.</P>
<P>Before Barnwell could reply, Mr. Emery was gone; "Ram&s;gate!" &s;aid he to him&s;elf. "Curricle!&mdash;Mi&s;s Freeman! This is &s;udden indeed!

<P>It was yet but eight o'clock; he determined, there|fore, to wait upon Mental immediately.

The hope of meeting Mental at Ram&s;gate, tended to make the journey thither no longer a matter of re|gret; and as he flattered him&s;elf, that his pro&s;ecutors would at lea&s;t acquaint him with their proceedings, he left particular directions to have all letters imme|diately forwarded to him; and, a&s;&s;uming as &s;erene a countenance as po&s;&s;ible, he joined the party in the breakfa&s;t room, which con&s;i&s;ted of Mr. and Mrs. Emery, the Mi&s;s Emerys, Mi&s;s Freeman, Lord Mor|ley, Mr. Ea&s;twood, and Capt. Middleton.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of his efforts to prevent it, the countenance of Barnwell &s;poke a language different to his tongue, and but ill accorded with the vivacity he a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>"Knight of the woeful countenance," cried Char|lotte Emery, "whence &s;prings thy &s;orrow?&mdash;"

<P>"Really, young man," cried Mrs. Emery, "you a&s;&s;ume a kind of gravity by no means becoming at your age&mdash;you po&s;itively vapour one!"</P>
<P>"What's the matter, Barnwell?" &s;aid Mr. Emery.</P>
<P>"I believe, 'pon my honor," cried Lord Morley, "that we are too &s;evere upon &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible a youth."</P>
<P>"Dear me!" cried Charlotte&mdash;"only look, Mi&s;s Freeman, how prettily he blu&s;hes!&mdash;Nay, child, I did not tell <HI>you</HI> to blu&s;h; but, really, there is a very lively &s;ympathy betwixt you."</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;e I were to publi&s;h the banns of marriage; at once," &s;aid Mr. Ea&s;twood, "betwixt George Barn|well, of the pari&s;h of&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I forbid the banns, in the name of one Milwood of Brompton!" interrupted Charlotte.</P>
<P>Barnwell turned pale, and the tea-cup clattered as he held it in his hand.</P>
<P>"I have been a &s;ilent auditor, Sir, of this kind of raillery &s;ome time," &s;aid Maria, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Mr. Emery; "but I now demand <HI>your</HI> interference to check &s;uch levity; &s;ince, it my friend feels no concern for the pain &s;he inflicts on the feelings of others, I can no longer endure the in&s;ults &s;he be&s;tows upon mine!"</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="038596_0183_1012A00A59B77348">
Charlotte looked grave.</P>
<P>"O dear! Mi&s;s Freeman," cried two or three at once&mdash;"O dear!&mdash;really you view the matter too &s;eriou&s;ly by half&mdash;Con&s;ider it as a joke."</P>
<P>"You will excu&s;e me," replied Maria; "but I can|not &s;o far forget the re&s;pect due to my character, as to yield it to the amu&s;ement of je&s;ters! I am &s;ure my dear Charlotte will acquit me of <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary</HI> &s;everity in my pre&s;ent appeal; and I hope, from this moment, to feel its &s;ucce&s;s."</P>
<P>"Very well, Madam&mdash;very well"&mdash;cried Char|lotte;&mdash;"you may talk <HI>us</HI> down with your notions of propriety, and all that &s;ort of thing; but you can't prevent grooms and &s;table boys from telling what they &s;ee and hear to the footmen; and if the footmen &s;hould whi&s;per the chambermaid, and &s;he &s;hould con|fide in the valet, and the valet &s;hould drop a word or two as he combs my Lord's hair, and then his Lord|&s;hip reveals it to me&mdash;why have not a right to tell my &s;tory again?"</P>
<P>"What does all this allude to?" &s;aid Mr. Emery.</P>

<P>"Give me leave to tell my own &s;tory," interrupt|ed Charlotte.</P>
<P>"Only remember, I do not vouch for your <HI>embel|li&s;hments,</HI> Charlotte," replied his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"You know, Sir," returned &s;he, "that when we fir&s;t &s;aw Mr. Barnwell, we all concluded that the young man had been bred in a mona&s;tery&mdash;he had all that cold &s;ort of gravity, that monks are &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s; and was for ever preaching about virtue, and propri|ety, and &s;uch things.

<P>"You &s;ee, Maria, what an incorrigible &s;he is!" &s;aid Mr. Emery.</P>
<P>"It's perfectly amazing to me," &s;aid Mr. Ea&s;t|wood, in a tone of ful&s;ome adulation, "how any one can be otherwi&s;e than enamoured of &s;uch an enchant|ing vivacity!"</P>
<P>"For my part," &s;aid Lord Morley, "I think it a mo&s;t enviable talent which Charlotte po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, of re|lieving a dull &s;tory, by throwing in a few <HI>da&s;hes</HI> of light and &s;hade.

<P>"Splendid fiction obtains a preference with your Lord&s;hip, then, over plain truth," &s;aid Maria.</P>
<P>"Out of all doubt! &s;aid his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>Barnwell, glad to put an end to the conver&s;ation, ran to the window, and announced the arrival of the carriages. A delay now commenced, by the po&s;itive refu&s;al of Maria to a&s;cend the curricle, and ended not till a con&s;iderable time was &s;pent in forming a new arrangement, which gave the curricle to Lord Morley and Emma Emery, placed Maria in his lord&s;hip's coach, and delivered Barnwell over to Captain&punc; Mid|dleton's po&s;t chariot.</P>

<P>AFTER a journey interrupted by no incident wor|thy of relation, the travellers arrived at a hou&s;e, pre|pared for their reception, at Ram&s;gate.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="038596_0185_1012A00EDE07AAF8">
Mrs. Emery and her daughters were delighted with its &s;ituation, commanding fine views of the &s;ea in the front, and an exten&s;ive &s;weep of country behind; and having no &s;ingle care upon their &s;pirits, they were negatively happy in participating, with others of the fir&s;t order of people, the amu&s;ements of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Lord Morley and the <HI>polite Divine</HI> al&s;o killed their time tolerably to their &s;atisfaction, with the aid of bathing rooms, libraries, theatres, raffles, danci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g, &s;ailing, riding, driving, eating, drinking, and &s;leeping.</P>
<P>Captain Middleton and Mr. Emery had other oc|cupations; they were game&s;ters in the confidence of each other, the former had been many years of the profe&s;&s;ion, the other was of later practice.&mdash;Mr. Freeman, his godfather and ma&s;ter, had married him to his ward, an heire&s;s, and had given him a &s;hare of his concerns.</P>
<P>Mr. Emery entered life with the faire&s;t pro&s;pects, and the be&s;t intentions; but unfortunately connect|ing him&s;elf with courtiers, and by their intere&s;ts with the government it&s;elf, his vanity defeated his intere&s;t, and he had injured, mo&s;t deeply, not only his own fortune, but that of his early benefactor. By the ar|tificial aid which his court friends afforded him, he was enabled to extend a credit, which imperceptibly, but inevitably, undermined his fortunes; &s;ince, in re|turn for that credit, a reciprocal accommodation was expected, which could only be yielded by narrowing their capital, whil&s;t additional credit called for its en|largement.</P>
<P>It is matter of peculiar regret, that the only me|thods which per&s;ons in Mr. Emery's &s;ituation can adopt, to retrieve their errors, are preci&s;ely tho&s;e which are equally likely to render them fatal. Thus, had Mr. Emery po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the re&s;olution to have nar|rowed his concerns, confined his trade, and le&s;&s;ened his expences, his con&s;equence in the eyes of the world would have &s;unk, his <HI>Court friends</HI> would have vani&s;h|ed, and tho&s;e whom <HI>he</HI> could no longer &s;erve, would at once have withheld their countenance from <HI>him;</HI> and the con&s;equence is obvious.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="038596_0186_1012A012F98259E0">
In addition to this con&s;ideration, Mr. Emery was naturally vain, and &s;hrunk from the idea of a tempo|rary degradation. Hope pointed from one &s;pecula|tion to another, till, in the pur&s;uit of reparation, he found de&s;truction; yet, though in &s;ight, he &s;truggled to conceal it from him&s;elf: he trembled with horror at the recollection of the wide ruin he had wrought, and, by various methods, &s;trove to murder his own thoughts.</P>
<P>Middleton was a man, who&s;e very heart was bad, and within who&s;e brea&s;t the voice of Con&s;cience had long been &s;tifled. The nece&s;&s;ities of Emery made him the dupe of this wretch, who, by pretending to initiate him in the mean arts of gaming, only &s;ecured him the more ea&s;ily his prey.</P>
<P>The amiable Maria carried with her to Ram&s;gate a &s;ilent &s;orrow, and concealed affection which preyed upon her health and &s;pirits; and ca&s;t a gloom over tho&s;e &s;cenes that enchanted others.</P>
<P>Barnwell, the unhappy Barnwell, was the prey of the mo&s;t afflicting remor&s;e, and tormenting uncer|tainty.</P>
<P>Such were the party, who by the &s;plendor of their e&s;tabli&s;hment, attracted the admiration of the rich, and the envy of the poor; <HI>that poor,</HI> who would often exchange their envy for pity, if, through the dazzling exterior of grandeur, they could view &s;uch hearts as Emery's.</P>
<P>Two or three days elap&s;ed, and brought no &s;ucce&s;s to Barnwell's &s;earch after Mental. He inquired minutely, and &s;ought diligently, but to no purpo&s;e. Nor had he received any intelligence from London. The fourth day, as he was returning from a walk, his attention was drawn to the &s;ea &s;hore, by the arrival of the hoy; and he &s;tood &s;ome time contemplating the motley crew as they di&s;embarked.</P>
<P>Among a variety of &s;trange figures, he particularly noticed a tall, thin man, dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;lovenly manner, in a &s;habby &s;uit of black, who, the moment he land|ed, &s;eated him&s;elf on a firkin of butter; and, pulling
<PB N="188" REF="038596_0187_1012A0170F1CED50">
out his pocket-book and pencil, began &s;cribbling, and exclaimed aloud&mdash;</P>
<P>"Dam'me, that'll do&mdash;fre&s;h water &s;ailing&mdash;the Sprightly Kitty&mdash;Batter&s;ea Bridge&mdash;Chel&s;ea Wa|ter Works&mdash;Spla&s;h&mdash;Spani&s;h&mdash;Keep moving&mdash;Pu&s;h on&mdash;What's to pay?&mdash;that's your &s;ort&mdash;It'll do, dam'me!"</P>
<P>Every body &s;tared with a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>"Who is that gentleman, pray?" &s;aid Barnwell to another pa&s;&s;enger, who &s;tood near him.</P>
<P>"Hum!" cried the &s;tranger&mdash;"Only notice him!"</P>
<P>In a minute the other &s;tarted from the butter-tub, and &s;et off a &s;camper, exclaiming, as he ran by Barn|well&mdash;"Dam'me, I've every thing but a plot!"</P>
<P>"Sir," &s;aid the &s;tranger to Barnwell, "that's one of the fir&s;t dramati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> geniu&s;es we have. He came down in the hoy, merely to &s;tudy characters; and, I warrant you, we &s;hall have a play next &s;ea&s;on &s;ome|thing about failing."</P>
<P>"Next &s;ea&s;on!" replied Barnwell: "he mu&s;t be a quick hand, then, at the&s;e matters."</P>
<P>"O, Sir, he'll turn you out two in a winter; and one &s;hall be equally as good as the other. But, pray, Sir, may I a&s;k if you can direct me to a Mr. Emery's re&s;idence here?"</P>
<P>The &s;mile which hovered on the lips of Barnwell, at the eccentricity of the dramati&s;t, fled in an in&s;tant; he trembled as he an&s;wered the inquiry, and was un|able to a&s;k the man his bu&s;ine&s;s there, much as he wi&s;hed to learn it.</P>
<P>"Perhaps you may know the per&s;on I want to &s;ee,' cried the man:&mdash;"its a Mr. Barnwell."</P>
<P>"Fortunate enough," &s;aid Barnwell, with a look ill according with the &s;entence:&mdash;"My name is Barnwell. I re&s;ide with Mr. Emery."</P>
<P>"You, Sir!&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;If you are the per|&s;on I want, you know a lady of the name of&mdash;."</P>
<P>"Milwood," interrupted Barnwell&mdash;Is it not &s;o?"</P>
<P>"The &s;ame, indeed," replied the man.</P>
<P>"Tell me, then, in&s;tantly, your bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;have

you any letters from her&mdash;any me&s;&s;age&mdash;any&mdash;"</P>
<P>The man retired &s;ome paces from Barnwell, and looking him full in the face&mdash;"Any me&s;&s;age from <HI>her!</HI>&mdash;Pray, Sir, what do you take me for?&mdash;No, Sir; you mi&s;take the per&s;on you have to deal with, I a&s;&s;ure you.

<P>They retired to&mdash;'s Hotel.&mdash;When they were &s;eated, and alone, the &s;tranger, pulling off his hat and &s;troaking his chin with an air of va&s;t impor|tance, began, in a pompous tone of voice&mdash;"My name, Sir, is Blackmore&mdash;Nehemiah Blackmore, of Hatton-Garden; a name not altogether new, I flatter my&s;elf, to the ears of the world.

<P>Barnwell too deeply felt the truth of the&s;e ill-timed ob&s;ervations&mdash;"Certainly&mdash;Yes&mdash;true&mdash;" replied he; but to your bu&s;ine&s;s, Sir."</P>
<P>"Why, Sir, you are young, I perceive, and new to the world, or it would not be nece&s;&s;ary to men|tion, that you are extremely fortunate in having fallen into &s;uch hands as Nehemiah Blackmore, of Harton Garden; who&s;e character is that of a peace|maker.&mdash;Upwards of a thou&s;and law &s;uits have been prevented by your humble &s;ervant; though I would not, for the world, have it known, as I &s;hould certain|ly be kicked out of the profe&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Still, Sir," &s;aid Barnwell, "you wander from the &s;ubject&mdash;I de&s;ire to know your in&s;tructions."</P>

<P>"Le&s;s prolixity, if it be po&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>"In &s;hort, then, Sir&mdash;being ordered to pro&s;ecute, I reflected upon the certain con&s;equences of &s;uch a mea&s;ure, which always expo&s;es both parties, and fre|quently &s;ixes three or four heads in a &s;ixpenny maga|zine&mdash;."</P>
<P>"For heaven's &s;ake, man &s;peak to the purpo&s;e," cried Barnwell, &s;tarting from his chair, and walking about the room&mdash;"&s;pare your&s;elf this needle&s;s pre|face to your demands&mdash;Say hone&s;tly, at once, that the wretch who married this lady, is willing to heal his wounded honor with gold; and that, if I will give it him without the mandate of the law, he will accept it&mdash;Is it not &s;o?"</P>

"Tell the mean wretch, then&mdash;that it is impo&s;|&s;ible to comply with his terms," &s;aid Barnwell, and walked towards the door.</P>
<P>"Stay, Sir&mdash;&s;top&mdash;you are very ra&s;h&mdash;very ra&s;h, indeed&mdash;Do you con&s;ider the con&s;equences?"</P>

<P>TWO days more elap&s;ed without affording Barn|well any intelligence of Mental; and he concluded, that, having accompli&s;hed the purpo&s;e of his journey, he had returned to town. The mind of Barnwell, in the mean time, was &s;uffering the &s;evere&s;t pains of which its nature was &s;u&s;ceptible. In addition to the acutene&s;s of his own feelings, the letters of his mo|ther
<PB N="192" REF="038596_0191_1012A02177591CF8">
and Eliza inflicted agonizing wounds upon his heart. The &s;tate of his mind became more and more evident to ob&s;ervers; and from an object of ridicule, he had become the &s;ubject of pity, even with the volatile Charlotte her&s;elf.</P>
<P>But the utmo&s;t powers of language are inadequate to de&s;cribe the conflict of contending influences in the bo&s;om of the amiable Maria. Pity was a nur&s;ling which &s;he had fo&s;tered there from the fir&s;t moment &s;he was capable of receiving impre&s;&s;ions. Benevo|lence was the in&s;tinct of Maria&mdash;and to di&s;pen&s;e around her comfort and peace, was the bu&s;ine&s;s of her hands, and the object of her thoughts.&mdash;When the merits of Barnwell had kindled in her heart a new and &s;trong emotion, &s;he had cheri&s;hed it without the remote&s;t apprehen&s;ion of danger. When &s;he di&s;cov|ered that virtuous &s;ympathies, and congenial ta&s;tes, imperceptibly had wrought a pa&s;&s;ion in her brea&s;t, &s;he &s;tarted not with &s;hame&mdash;&s;he examined the ob|ject of her admiration in every point of view, and found him worthy; while the &s;imilarity of their di&s;po&s;itions and pur&s;uits, drew from Barnwell an at|tention, which Hope had painted to her mind in the colours mo&s;t agreeable to her wi&s;hes. It was not, therefore, till the quick echo of &s;candal had vibrated to her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ar &s;tories to the prejudice of his moral character, that the brea&s;t of Maria ever felt a pang. But when his &s;ub&s;equent behaviour &s;anctioned the &s;urmi&s;es formed upon report; when &s;he beheld his former openne&s;s of countenance changed into a con|tracted brow, and a timid eye; when &s;he &s;aw his for|mer polite attentions converted into the mo&s;t ill|timed ab&s;ences of mind&mdash;his occa&s;ional &s;tarts&mdash;his abrupt &s;ighs&mdash;and various other &s;ymptoms, that too plainly &s;ay&mdash;"My heart is not at ea&s;e!&mdash;" then was Maria mi&s;erable indeed! She felt his &s;orrows, and would have healed them by the &s;acrifice of all that was deare&s;t to her in exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>As &s;he pur&s;ued this train of thought, however, and traced the &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;e of his inquietudes to Mil|wood,
<PB N="193" REF="038596_0192_1012A024528EE678">
pity for his &s;ufferings became dimini&s;hed, by a jealous apprehen&s;ion, which &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to conquer. In vain &s;he reproved the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of her feelings: &s;he found, that the heart will act as a free agent; and often, very often, again&s;t the cool, di&s;&s;uading admonitions of the judgment.</P>
<P>That heart &s;till cheri&s;hed for Barnwell the glow of love; and, in &s;pite of her efforts to di&s;&s;emble, the effects of that love were con&s;picuous in many of her actions.</P>
<P>The whole of the party, except Barnwell, being en|gaged on a &s;ailing trip, to vi&s;it the fleet, then anchor|ed in the Roads, he had &s;pent great part of the day in writing letters for Mr. Emery; when, towards evening, a per&s;on inquired for him, who would im|part his errand to him&s;elf only.

<P>"This is my bit of place, plea&s;e your honor; and there is a grand lady within, who gave me that letter for your honor."</P>
<P>Barnwell entered, and di&s;covered Milwood, ele|gantly attired in a travelling dre&s;s. The fi&s;herman retired to the out&s;ide of the hut, and they were left alone.</P>
<P>"How came you hither?" cried Barnwell. "Where is your uncle?"&mdash;</P>
<P>There was a wild horror in her looks&mdash;&s;he fixed

her eyes on him, gra&s;ped him by the hand, and made no reply to his que&s;tions. She conducted him in this manner, through the fi&s;herman's garden, to an aven|ue that led direct to the cliffs.&mdash;Barnwell began to tremble for her intellects, &s;o well &s;he feigned the cha|racter of confirmed De&s;pair. When they had a&s;cen|ded a &s;tupendous height, &s;he approached the extre|mity of the cliff that overhung an inlet of the &s;ea, who&s;e billows tumbled at its ba&s;e with an awful roar|ing.</P>
<P>"Here, Barnwell, we mu&s;t pau&s;e," &s;aid &s;he, in a tone of voice expre&s;&s;ive of the firme&s;t re&s;olution&mdash;"we are alone&mdash;unheard&mdash;un&s;een by mortal!"&mdash;then fixing her eyes on the &s;etting &s;un&mdash;"Witne&s;s for me, thou glorious orb, de&s;cending now beneath the expan&s;e of waters&mdash;If the&s;e eyes for the <HI>la&s;t time</HI> are fixed on thee, O, bear me witne&s;s, in the chancery of Heaven&mdash;here &s;tands my murderer!"</P>
<P>Barnwell &s;tarted!&mdash;</P>
<P>"The agitation of the mind," continued &s;he, "con&s;equent on an adventure like that which &s;evered us, &s;o rudely, from each other, is now over, Sir. There exi&s;ts no more within this bo&s;om, doubts and de&s;ires, contending for empire:&mdash;the conflict is deci|ded. I am free from the controul both of my uncle, and the being, who imagined that the mummery of a ceremony could con&s;ign my heart to his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. They have both &s;worn never to &s;ee me more."</P>
<P>"Indeed!" exclaimed Barnwell.</P>
<P>"Yes," replied &s;he; "but you, Sir, they mean to pur&s;ue with all the vengeance with which the law inve&s;ts them.&mdash;It &s;eems you have thought fit to reject their overtures to compromi&s;e, and have deter|mined rather to &s;uffer a ridiculous exhibition of your&s;elf and me, than part, a little &s;ooner than you mu&s;t, with a few filthy counters!"</P>
<P>Barnwell was amazed!</P>
<P>"It would be ab&s;urd, through a fal&s;e delicacy, to &s;peak le&s;s to the purpo&s;e, Sir.&mdash;We are not now mingled with the &s;ubjects of prejudice and forms, in
<PB N="195" REF="038596_0194_1012A02BA6D50A40">
what is termed &s;ociety. You and I are, upon this &s;pot, <HI>our&s;elves alone;</HI> and the expre&s;&s;ion of our feelings to each other need &s;uffer no re&s;traint. All that we view around us, at pre&s;ent, is the work of nature, &s;ave the&s;e artificial habiliments that deck our per&s;ons.&mdash;Be ours, then, the language of nature. For my&s;elf, I am determined to &s;peak no other. Thus, then, &s;ays my heart&mdash;that it will exi&s;t upon no other terms, than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your love. Say, then, Barnwell&mdash;Do you bid me &s;till enjoy the cheer|ful rays of life&mdash;or &s;hall I quickly &s;eek the &s;hades of everla&s;ting night?"</P>
<P>"How wildly you conver&s;e!" &s;aid Barnwell:&mdash;"&s;urely your rea&s;on, Milwood&mdash;"</P>
<P>&mdash;"Has thrown off the fetters that controuled it," interrupted &s;he. "The true end of rea&s;on is to lead us to happine&s;s. Two paths are opened to me, and one of them is&mdash;Death!&mdash;Surely that trembling is feigned, Sir&mdash;or you would not he&s;itate to pre|vent a cata&s;trophe which &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly affected you."</P>
<P>"How prevent it, Milwood?"</P>
<P>"By acceding to the propo&s;itions offered you."</P>
<P>"It is impo&s;&s;ible!"</P>
<P>"Nothing more ea&s;y:&mdash;your bond for the greater part would be accepted; and, &s;urely, three or four hundred might be rai&s;ed immediately. <HI>I</HI> have &s;ome baubles, which I &s;hould deem well di&s;po&s;ed of in procuring your peace of mind. But, Barnwell, there is a deliberate coolne&s;s, too evident to be overlooked, that tells me, 'tis your wi&s;h, that the affair &s;hould bur&s;t upon the public ear. I mu&s;t have been mi&s;ta|ken in you, Sir, when I thought otherwi&s;e. But, mark me, while I &s;wear, in the hallowed pre&s;ence of Omni&s;cience!" (and &s;he knelt) "not beyond the limits of another day will Milwood live, if you per|&s;i&s;t in a refu&s;al of the terms!"</P>
<P>"Hold, hold&mdash;for heaven's &s;ake, retract!" cried Barnwell.</P>
<P>"'Twas not ra&s;hly &s;worn, and &s;hall be &s;acredly ob&s;erved," &s;aid &s;he, ri&s;ing with a firm, maje&s;tic air.</P>

The &s;oul of Barnwell was tortured with &s;evere&s;t conflicts. He could not gaze upon her form without a love, that equalled adoration. His own heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">void of guile, &s;u&s;pected not deceit in her. He conceived he &s;aw before him, mi&s;ery and de&s;pair of his own creation; and his countenance proclaimed to Mil|wood, that the moment proper for the attack was come.</P>
<P>Somewhat &s;oftening her voice and her manner, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed his hand&mdash;"Could I have ever thought <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> would have doomed me to de&s;truction, Barnwell!&mdash;<HI>me,</HI> did I &s;ay? Is it not po&s;&s;ible, that <HI>with me</HI> may pe|ri&s;h one, who&s;e future &s;miles <HI>might</HI> have ble&s;&s;ed us, Barnwell?"</P>
<P>"O, hold!&mdash;My wife&mdash;my guide&mdash;my fate&mdash;lead, direct, controul me, as thou wilt!&mdash;Live, Mil|wood; live, on any terms you plea&s;e."</P>
<P>&punc;With matchle&s;s art &s;he guarded again&s;t this over|flow of his affection; and cautiou&s;ly reflecting upon her &s;ituation&mdash;"Nay, Barnwell," cried &s;he, "add not this cruel pity to my &s;ufferings! If it is re&s;olved, that I mu&s;t die, in mercy do not &s;hake my re&s;olution, by the thought that you would feel a pang, when I am dead!"</P>
<P>"Talk not of death," &s;aid Barnwell. "Do I not &s;ay, that I will &s;ign the bond?&mdash;Ay," continued he, wildly, "though &s;ure de&s;truction were the penalty. Come, then, let us &s;eek this Blackmore."</P>
<P>"O, Barnwell, how has this tenderne&s;s altered all my thoughts. No; you &s;hall <HI>not</HI> &s;ign this bond; at lea&s;t not at pre&s;ent. Here are &s;ome jewels of my mother's; take them; they have been valued at &s;ix hundred pounds. You can di&s;patch &s;ome confiden|tial per&s;on to London, who may di&s;po&s;e of them. But, in the mean time, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o well I know the wretch's mercenary &s;pirit, to pro|cure three hundred pounds this night. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> you could borrow &s;o much till the jewels are di&s;po&s;ed of&mdash;"</P>
<P>"O, with ea&s;e," cried the poor victim. "I have always more than that of Mr. Emery's in my po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, and I am &s;ure he will oblige me."</P>

"And yet," &s;aid Milwood, "would it not lead to a variety of que&s;tions, and conjectures, if you were to a&s;k him? As it will be but, at farthe&s;t, for a few days, could you not without his knowledge&mdash;"</P>
<P>Barnwell &s;tarted&mdash;"What! <HI>&s;teal</HI> it, do you mean?"</P>
<P>"If you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> put &s;o har&s;h a con&s;truction on my meaning, why, call it <HI>&s;tealing.</HI> I conceive, merely to borrow from an idle fund, for &s;o &s;hort a time, and with &s;uch &s;ecurity for the repayment, differs e&s;&s;en|tially from <HI>&s;tealing;</HI>&mdash;but u&s;e your own di&s;cretion. I merely hinted the objection, from the motive of de&s;iring to &s;ave you pain; &s;ince you mu&s;t either con|fe&s;s our connection too abruptly, (which would be conveyed to your Eliza, and your mother) or evade it by a fal&s;ehood&mdash;a meaner vice, in my e&s;timation, than even <HI>&s;tealing!</HI>"</P>
<P>This &s;ophi&s;try was a &s;tumbling block to Barnwell. He &s;ighed&mdash;he inwardly lamented the alternative to which he was reduced, but was &s;ilent. They now walked towards the fi&s;herman's hut.&mdash;Milwood de|po&s;ited the jewels in his hands, which Barnwell &s;aid he would not &s;ell, but pledge for the &s;um immediate|ly required, and would &s;oon redeem them. He en|gaged to return to the hut in half an hour, and de|parted.</P>
<P>He entered the re&s;idence of Mr. Emery&mdash;he open|ed his bureau&mdash;his hands trembled&mdash;he counted out three hundred pounds in bank notes. In wri|ting his name on one of them, a tear fell, and blotted it;&mdash;it &s;urpri&s;ed him:&mdash;"Why do I weep?" &s;aid he&mdash;"Childi&s;h weakne&s;s!"</P>
<P>As he returned through the town he kept his eyes fixed on the ground; he imagined every pa&s;&s;enger looked &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly upon him. When he entered the room, Milwood received him with open arms. He breathed hard&mdash;his countenance was pale, and his knees tottered.</P>
<P>"You are unwell, my Barnwell," &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e.</P>
<P>"A little &s;ick&mdash;It will be over &s;oon."</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="038596_0197_1012A031ADBFAB80">
"If this is the con&s;equence of your effort to pre|&s;erve me, Barnwell, rather let me peri&s;h than exi&s;t upon your mi&s;ery.&mdash;Go&mdash;replace the&s;e notes&mdash;and be happy!"</P>
<P>"Milwood&mdash;it is not ea&s;y to vanqui&s;h tho&s;e out|po&s;ts of virtue, which have long repelled within my bo&s;om the approach of a <HI>mean</HI> thought. A reverence of honour is the &s;trong guard of virtue. I have bro|ken down the trenches of &s;elf-approbation, by the commi&s;&s;ion of a mean, if not a vicious act!&mdash;But it is done&mdash;and&mdash;I &s;hall&mdash;I hope&mdash;&s;oon forget it!"</P>
<P>"Indeed&mdash;indeed, my Barnwell you think too &s;e|riou&s;ly. Had you even committed a robbery, you could not have di&s;covered more remor&s;e. Surely, there is &s;omething like weakne&s;s in yielding to the&s;e vapouri&s;h impre&s;&s;ions."</P>
<P>"It <HI>may</HI> be weakne&s;s&mdash;but&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Come, come, no more of this&mdash;I have another &s;ubject now for your attention. Do you ob&s;erve a little cottage at the foot of yon a&s;cent that winds up to the cliffs? I have engaged a &s;mall but neat apart|ment there, for a few days. Shall I have your ap|probation?&mdash;Come, 'tis but a few minutes walk.</P>
<P>There was a magic &s;urrounded this woman, which Barnwell had long found omnipotent. He was &s;ur|pri&s;ed upon entering the cottage to find it mo&s;t ele|gantly, though &s;imply, furni&s;hed. The evening was warm&mdash;Milwood conducted him to an alcove in the garden, that commanded a near view of the &s;ea. A gentle breeze floated melodiou&s;ly on the &s;urface of the ocean; the moon's image was reflected in the deep, and her &s;ilver beams &s;hed an undazzling &s;plen|dor on the &s;urrounding &s;cenery. The &s;oothing &s;ilence of the hour was uninterrupted; &s;ave, now and then, the nightingale &s;ent forth her &s;oft and &s;weete&s;t notes; or the da&s;hing of di&s;tant oars murmured melan|choly on their ears.</P>
<P>A repa&s;t of fruit and home-made wine furni&s;hed the table; whil&s;t Milwood, by every artifice in her power, e&s;&s;ayed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;ooth his melancholy, and turn the current of his reflections.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="038596_0198_1012A034C16596F8">
The &s;en&s;ibility of Barnwell's &s;oul was exqui&s;ite, and in &s;ome fatal moments gave pa&s;&s;ion a &s;uperiority over principle. 'Twas thus that, in the enchanting care&s;&s;es of this beautiful woman, he forget all other exi&s;tence. Rapture &s;ucceeded to bli&s;s, and his whole &s;oul yielded to the ec&s;tacies of love!</P>
<P>An hour or two had pa&s;&s;ed away in the&s;e endear|ments, which Milwood artfully mingled with &s;hort accounts of her relea&s;e from her uncle and hu&s;band, and her vows of future fidelity to him. Still &s;he hinted the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of a <HI>little</HI> longer concealment of their connection from his friends; well aware that the whole force of her enchantment re&s;ted on that point&mdash;one breath of &s;u&s;picion would have ruined all her deep-laid &s;chemes, and one effort of his friends would have relea&s;ed her victim from the &s;acrifice, to which her mo&s;t infamous arts had doomed him.</P>
<P>There cannot be a more dangerous &s;ituation for youth, than that which, <HI>from any motive,</HI> induces them to withdraw a confidence in tho&s;e, who by experience, intere&s;t, and affection, are <HI>always be&s;t,</HI> and <HI>often &s;olely,</HI> qualified to advi&s;e them.</P>
<P>It was nearly midnight, and of cour&s;e too late to return to Mr. Emery's; but this occa&s;ioned him no unea&s;ine&s;s, as from the irregular mode of living at watering places, the individuals of the family &s;eldom &s;aw each other, except at dinner.</P>
<P>As they were about to retire, a little &s;ail, which had hovered in &s;ight for &s;ome time, made the &s;hore immediately under the alcove. Two per&s;ons landed, one of whom, muffled up in a black cloak, &s;aid to his companion, in a voice which Barnwell in&s;tantly re|cognized as Mental's&mdash;"We mu&s;t, if po&s;&s;ible, ob|tain a lodging at the hotel to-night; or if not, a ram|ble among the cliffs and rocks will occupy the time till morning."</P>
<P>"Ay, ma&s;ter," &s;aid the other; "but I'd rather be comfortably tumbling about on a &s;oft feather bed, than be climbing hard rocks by moon-light."</P>
<P>"<HI>You</HI> might," &s;aid Mental; "but think you now,
<PB N="200" REF="038596_0199_1012A03A17ECC568">
that the villain who &s;educed, and then abandoned, my poor child, and who with ju&s;tice may be deemed her murderer, <HI>&s;leeps undi&s;turbed</HI> upon his bed of down?

<P>They then wandered out of hearing.</P>
<P>"Poor Mental&punc;" &s;aid Barnwell.</P>
<P>"Mental!" exclaimed Milwood, trembling.&mdash;"Do you know that per&s;on then&mdash;and is his name Mental?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Barnwell, "'Tis an uncommon name. Do you know any of the &s;ame?"</P>
<P>"I <HI>did, once!</HI>" &s;aid &s;he, with a &s;igh, more &s;orrow|ful than even <HI>&s;he</HI> could have <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eigned.</HI> It came from the heart.

<P>THE certainty of Mental's being at Ram&s;gate, was &s;ome &s;lender relief to the agitated mind of Barnwell. The next morning, therefore, he bu&s;ied him&s;elf in inquiries, and at length di&s;covered his re&s;idence. The whole of that day, however, Mental was from home, and Barnwell merely left his addre&s;s.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e and family of Mr. Emery grew hateful to his &s;ight; his own reflections were intolerable;

and the only re&s;ource left him, was the &s;ociety of Milwood. This con&s;ummate mi&s;tre&s;s of hypocri&s;y now amu&s;ed him with the relation of a new tale, of the manner in which &s;he had di&s;po&s;ed of the three hundred pounds. Mr. <HI>Nehemiah Blackmore,</HI> of <HI>Hatton Garden,</HI> was once more brought to figure in the &s;cene. He produced a fictitious relea&s;e from the pretended hu&s;band of Milwood, and a bond for five hundred pounds, payable to him&s;elf, with intere&s;t, at the expi|ration of three months.&mdash;The artifices of this man (who was, perhaps, one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ba&s;e among that cla&s;s of attornies, which calls down unmerited cen&s;ure and infamy upon the profe&s;&s;ion at large) added to the arts of Milwood, overpowered the &s;cruples and he&s;itations of a young man half di&s;tracted with the perplexity of his &s;ituation, and he &s;igned the bond.</P>
<P>He now con&s;idered Milwood as his wife, and was only re&s;trained by her entreaties, for <HI>yet a little more delay,</HI> from acquainting this parent and his &s;i&s;ter with his &s;ituation. He was determined to confide imme|diately in Mental, and went early the next morning to his lodgings.</P>
<P>Soon as that extraordinary man ob&s;erved Barn|well, he ran to him, and &s;haking him by the hand&mdash;"I have di&s;covered him!" &s;aid he:&mdash;"the mon&s;ter &s;hall not e&s;cape the vengeance due to his enormous crimes.

upon the &s;poils of ruined families. Thus the upper apartments frequently re&s;emble the galleries of an ho|tel, where waiters are groaning beneath the weight of wines and tavern dainties; whil&s;t the lower range more generally a&s;&s;umes the appearance of an ill-pro|vided lazar-hou&s;e.

<P>"Figure to your&s;elf a &s;tone arched roof rece&s;s, about ten feet &s;quare, which contained a bed, a table, two or three chairs, &s;ome boxes, and five inhabit|ants.

His &s;on appeared rather more than forty, and was employed at a pre&s;s, in one corner of the room, in cutting &s;mooth the edges of &s;ome pamphlets, which his wife was &s;titching.

home&mdash;let my father have a dinner to day, for God's &s;ake!" "Nay, nay, Ned," cried the old man, "don't be cro&s;s now&mdash;but give a civil an&s;wer to the gentle|man. Is it a young gentleman, Patty?" [to his grand-daughter.] "No, grand-father," &s;aid Patty. "Speak to him, Ned," &s;aid the old man. "I've nothing to &s;ay," &s;aid his &s;on, "that it concerns him to hear."</P>
<P>"Have you no wants, my friend?" &s;aid I. "Would you not be happy to be able to render your father and your family more comfortable than they are?" "That's no concern of yours," replied he: "I la|bour from morning to night, and they exi&s;t by the fruits of it&mdash;But, come, Kate&mdash;" [to his wife]&mdash;"What do you &s;nivel at?&mdash;The brat will be waking &s;oon, and you'll not get the&s;e fini&s;hed. What bu&s;i|ne&s;s has that fellow to bring people here to &s;tare at me?&mdash;Come&mdash;quick&mdash;quick&mdash;I &s;tand &s;till."</P>
<P>"Struck with the uncommon behaviour of this man, I became more curious to learn his hi&s;tory, in pro|portion as he di&s;covered le&s;s inclination to reveal it. I therefore addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the old man:&mdash;Your &s;on, Sir, &s;aid I, appears to me to have &s;uffered &s;o much from fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ions of benevolence, as to have made him &s;purn with indignation, all preten&s;ions of that nature. "Alack-a-day! good Sir, whoever you be, I am &s;ure you de&s;erve better treatment:&mdash;but my poor Ned!&mdash;" "Hold your tongue, father," cried the &s;on.</P>
<P>"I could no longer refrain&mdash;I approached him, and laying my hand upon his &s;houlder&mdash;Friend, &s;aid I, you mi&s;take my character: I come not to wound your hone&s;t and prai&s;e-worthy pride&mdash;I honor inde|pendence of &s;pirit&mdash;I am my&s;elf, al&s;o, a &s;ufferer by the fal&s;e colours with which men paint them&s;elves. My heart is not whole, but my pur&s;e is heavy&mdash;too heavy for an individual. I have no pro&s;pect of hap|pine&s;s before me, but in rendering &s;ervice where me|rit demands it. Then, taking his hand&mdash;Let me, my friend, &s;erve you. I &s;ee your heart&mdash;I <HI>feel</HI> your

<HI>feelings</HI>&mdash;Come&mdash;come&mdash;tru&s;t me&mdash;I am no de|ceiver.</P>
<P>"The man looked &s;tedfa&s;tly in my face&mdash;I never beheld &s;o har&s;h a &s;et of features&mdash;His countenance was almo&s;t &s;avage. After he had &s;tared at me a few minutes&mdash;"You may mean very well," &s;aid he:&mdash;"'tis po&s;&s;ible your intentions may be good&mdash;But go, Sir, go&mdash;we are a mi&s;erable family, and too far &s;unk in wretchedne&s;s for any re&s;cue but death!&mdash;Don't hinder us, then&mdash;but go." Ju&s;t then a man tapped at the door, and entered. "Who's that?" exclaim|ed the grandfather, again drawing his lovely charge nearer to him. "Its lawyer Blackmore, father," &s;aid the woman.</P>
<P>At the name of Blackmore, Barnwell &s;tarted.&mdash;"Blackmore! did you &s;ay, Sir?" cried he.</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Mental, "Do you know &s;uch a per&s;on?"</P>
<P>"I&mdash;I&mdash;have heard of him," &s;aid Barnwell, glow|ing with confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Well," continued Mental, "this Blackmore en|tered, and with a &s;upercilious air approached towards the old man&mdash;"Once more, Mr. Norris," &s;aid he, "I am come with offers of clemency to your &s;on. My client by no means wi&s;hes to detain him here; it is far from his intention; it is by no means his wi&s;h; he don't de&s;ire it; it is far from plea&s;ant to him; and I hope, therefore, you have prevailed upon him to&mdash;." "Wicked, wicked man!" cried the grandfather;&mdash;"you &s;hare in the guilt of this tran&s;|action, by becoming the bearer of &s;uch propo&s;als!"</P>
<P>"Le&s;s calm was his &s;on. Quitting his work&punc; he &s;eized the lawyer by the &s;houlders, and thru&s;ting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> out of the apartment&mdash;"If ever you enter this place again, on this errand, ra&s;cal!" cried he, "you will not quit it living." He followed the lawyer through the pa&s;&s;age to the gate, exclaiming violently again&s;t him.</P>
<P>"Whil&s;t he was out of the room, his wife came to me&mdash;"O, God ble&s;s you for your goodne&s;s! I

hope you will excu&s;e my poor hu&s;band; but his brain is almo&s;t turned, Sir, by bad u&s;age. I wi&s;h I could tell you our &s;tory; but he is grown &s;o wild, we dare not contradict him. O, he is &s;o altered!&mdash;There was not a kinder creature living, a more tender and affectionate hu&s;band or father, till that bad man, Cap|tain Middleton&mdash;."</P>
<P>"Here the hu&s;band returned, and the poor wo|man, with evident &s;ymptoms of fear, went to her work.</P>
<P>"Son, &s;on," &s;aid the old man, "I charge thee, let this kind gentleman know our &s;tory. Come, now, I pray, do. I am &s;ure he is a good-hearted gentleman, and will &s;erve thee."</P>
<P>"Poor old man!" &s;aid his &s;on; "and you my dear girl [to his daughter;] my little boy too; and you Kate [to his wife,] I feel for you all! But, p&s;ha, what but pain re&s;ults from feeling! I will not yield to tenderne&s;s&mdash;Come, come, to work, to work, I pray you, Sir, to leave us."</P>
<P>"Here there was a violent bur&s;t of laughter in the court yard, ju&s;t within hearing. Not far from the window, a party of young fellows were playing with &s;ome of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and their mirth was as loud as ob&s;cene.</P>
<P>"Daughter," cried the younger Norris, "&s;top your ears&mdash;Leave the room."</P>
<P>"O, no! no!" cried the old man, &s;till holding her.</P>
<P>"O, God!" exclaimed the &s;on&mdash;"where is the equity of our laws&mdash;where is the ju&s;tice of our land?&mdash;To be caged, thus, amid&s;t the mo&s;t abandon|ed of &s;ociety!&mdash;and for what crime?&mdash;Refu&s;ing to pro&s;titute my own child!"</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed I."</P>
<P>"Even as I have &s;aid," replied he. "Come, &s;it you down, and for very madne&s;s will I tell you our tale. But mark me, I court not your pity&mdash;I &s;pread no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for your compa&s;&s;ion!&mdash;That venerable old man, my father, about &s;ixty years ago, entered into bu&s;ine&s;s in the city of Canterbury. I was his only

child; I learnt his art, that of bookbinder and &s;ta|tioner. My mother died&mdash;I married; and as my fa|ther declined in years, I conducted our concerns. Nineteen years of time had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince my marriage, when there came to be quartered in our city, a regi|ment of militia. We kept a library, and of cour&s;e our &s;hop became a &s;ort of lounge for the ladies of Canterbury. The officers of the regiment &s;oon di&s;|covered this, and pe&s;tered us with their company. My girl, there, though now pale and &s;ickly-looking, was then as fair a wench as any in all Canterbury. Her beauty obtained her many ful&s;ome flatteries, of which we endeavoured to &s;hew her the in&s;ignificant value; and I believe the girl had &s;en&s;e enough to treat them for the mo&s;t part, with ju&s;t that civil indifference they de&s;erved:&mdash;but there was one &s;coundrel&mdash;a hand&s;ome fellow, too&mdash;a captain in the regiment, who made a a more than ordinary impre&s;&s;ion upon my poor girl's heart. His attachment was evident; his attentions too con&s;picuous to be overlooked; but his purpo&s;es, his infernal purpo&s;es, he well concealed. Under the ma&s;k of kindne&s;s for me, and my family, he held out a bait, which my active and indu&s;trious &s;pirit too eagerly gra&s;ped at. About that time a li|brarian at Margate failed; the &s;hop and bu&s;ine&s;s were to be di&s;po&s;ed of; and having obtained, by his frequent vi&s;its, a mo&s;t familiar footing in our family, Captain Middleton, after a proper introduction, of|fered to lend me a &s;um &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e them, upon the joint bond of my father and my&s;elf; with the &s;imple condition, that an elderly lady, his friend, &s;hould board and lodge there. Unfortunately we ac|cepted his treacherous offer; we completed the pur|cha&s;e; and my father, being indi&s;po&s;ed, and having gradully lo&s;t his &s;ight, removed to Margate, accom|panied by my daughter.</P>
<P>"'Twas not long ere the real purpo&s;e of this &s;eem|ing genero&s;ity was expo&s;ed, by the following accident:&mdash;Captain Middleton frequently rode from Canter|bury to Margate, and never failed paying his re&s;pects
<PB N="208" REF="038596_0207_1012A050F3526D80">
to the old lady, whom he &s;ettled in our hou&s;e. I my&s;elf, having to &s;uperintend the bu&s;ine&s;s both at Canterbury and Margate, al&s;o had frequent occa&s;ions to be there. It happened, that, one evening as I walk|ed round the garden at the back of the hou&s;e, I heard the voice of Captain Middleton, loudly di&s;puting in a &s;ummer hou&s;e with Mrs. Ma&s;ters, the old lady; and as I pa&s;&s;ed the door, which was &s;hut, I heard him di&s;tinctly utter&mdash;'My God, Madam, I am trifled with:&mdash;do you imagine I have been paying three hundred pounds for mere <HI>gape &s;eed!</HI> I tell you, the &s;tay of the regiment at Canterbury is uncertain; and I am determined to po&s;&s;e&s;s this jewel before I quit Kent.' 'I &s;ay, Sir,' replied the old Beldame, 'that your im|patience will ruin every thing. The girl loves you, I am certain; but &s;he has been &s;trictly educated, and her notions of virtue are not to be overcome &s;o ea&s;ily as we conquered Elinor Mental's.'</P>
<P>"Judge," &s;aid Mental to Barnwell at this part of his narrative, "how I felt at that name, and at the &s;ub&s;equent remarks!&mdash;I &s;truggled hard; and, in part, concealed my emotion, as I longed to hear the con|clu&s;ion of the tale.</P>
<P>"Pre&s;uming," &s;aid Norris, upon what I heard, how much I was intere&s;ted in their di&s;cour&s;e, I con|tinued to li&s;ten. 'Ay,' cried Middleton, 'that affair was well managed:&mdash;to the la&s;t hour of my life, Mo|ther Ma&s;ters, I &s;hall be indebted to you for that bu|&s;ine&s;s; but here you boggle cur&s;edly; and yet this chit has not half the cunning of the jilt Mental.' 'True' replied the other; 'but there is &s;o much more virtue and <HI>fu&s;s</HI> in the way than there was with Mental. Be&s;ides, here are a father and mother; Mental was the ca&s;t-away charge of a neglectful boarding &s;chool governe&s;s.&mdash;I repeat, Sir, you mu&s;t have patience, or you will &s;poil all.' Here their con|ver&s;ation broke off; but I had heard enough to kin|dle a fire in my veins. I am by nature warm, and impatient of in&s;ult;&mdash;bur&s;ting open the door, I &s;eiz|ed the villain, and exhau&s;ted my rage in cur&s;es on

his head. Guilt made him coward&mdash;He &s;ubmitted tamely to my anger.&mdash;The woman left the arbour, and in a few hours the hou&s;e. In vain he attempted to palliate his intentions. I was deaf to every thing he &s;aid. I continued roughly to handle him, and never relinqui&s;hed my hold, till I had kicked him complete|ly out of doors.</P>
<P>"Every hour &s;ince that, the mean and cowardly villain has been planning the ruin of my family. His fir&s;t &s;tep was, to put the bond he held, immediately in execution again&s;t me; and, as a fit engine for his infernal purpo&s;e, he cho&s;e the man you have ju&s;t now &s;een as a lawyer. If you know any thing of law, you need not be told, Sir, that, in the hands of wicked men, it may be ea&s;ily made the de&s;truction of poor debtors.</P>
<P>"My bu&s;ine&s;s was neglected, in the attendance nece&s;&s;ary to carry on a fruitle&s;s defence again&s;t his extortions; my little capital was exhau&s;ted; my fa|ther's hou&s;es were &s;old; my cu&s;tomers for&s;ook me; my real creditors flocked about me; my effects were &s;eized, and &s;old. But the aim of this vil|lain was revenge; he therefore preferred &s;eiz|ing my per&s;on; and having hunted me from one part of the kingdom to another, for &s;ome months, he has at length &s;ucceeded to the utmo&s;t of his malicious wi&s;h. My poor, infirm parent will not quit me, but prefers this dungeon to a workhou&s;e. My daughter he will not tru&s;t a minute from him, being tormen|ted with the notion that Middleton will will yet ob|tain her.</P>
<P>"I have had friends, fal&s;e &s;ummer friends, whom now I never &s;ee. Judge then, Sir, if there is not &s;ome excu&s;e for my ferocious di&s;po&s;ition. I am like a hunted bea&s;t taken in the toils; and have lo&s;t all hope in heaven, all confidence in man.

&mdash;ay, rather would I dig one general gulph, and plunge wife, father, children, &s;elf, all living, to its bottom, than pro&s;titute the child I have given birth to!"</P>
<P>"Is there &s;uch a villain in exi&s;tence, &s;aid I, as this Middleton? Where is his re&s;idence?</P>
<P>"Six months," replied Norris, "I have been im|mured in this pri&s;on; of cour&s;e he is living but where I know not. He has never been here him&s;elf, but all his propo&s;als are made through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the lawyer Blackmore.</P>
<P>"I have heard that the wicked wretch, who has been his a&s;&s;i&s;tant in many a &s;cene of infamy, the Mrs. Ma&s;ters, is now dangerou&s;ly ill at Ram&s;gate, and lingers under all the horrors of remor&s;e, in expecta|tion of her di&s;&s;olution.'</P>
<P>"At Ram&s;gate!&mdash;Can you addre&s;s me to her, my friend, &s;aid I. I have inducements to &s;ee this wo|man, of which you have no conception. You have mentioned, in your narrative, the name of one, whom I ought to have cheri&s;hed in my own bo&s;om, but whom I abandoned to the loo&s;e guardian&s;hip of an hireling.

<P>"Gracious Goodne&s;s!" exclaimed Mrs. Norris lifting up her eyes; "and what has become of the' poor creature!"</P>
<P>"Dead!&mdash;to my comfort&mdash;dead!&mdash;exclaimed I. But if her &s;educer lives; and if, by the in&s;tructions of this Ma&s;ters, I can di&s;cover him, vengeance &s;hall yet o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ertake him.&mdash;This very night I will &s;et off for Ram&s;gate; and a part of the vengeance I will hurl on this wretch, &s;hall be the deliverance of your per|&s;ecuted family."</P>
<P>"Alas! good gentleman, you know not how deep|ly our di&s;tre&s;&s;es have involved us," &s;aid the elder Norris. "A thou&s;and pounds would hardly clear us; and then my poor Ned would be a&s;hamed to &s;ee Canterbury again."</P>
<P>"No!" exclaimed I, "he &s;hall not be a&s;hamed.&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

had re&s;olved upon my conduct; and contriving to &s;lip my pur&s;e into Mrs. Norris's hand, unob&s;erved by her hu&s;band, I took my leave of the&s;e victims of ini|quitous power. The nece&s;&s;ary directions for their liberation were given; and I arrived at Ram&s;gate in time to hear from the lips of the dying wretch, Ma&s;|ters, the horrible tale of my Elinor's de&s;truction. I obtained the addre&s;s of Middleton, which was in London. I returned thither the next day, and traced him to Emery's, in Portland Place, where I learnt, that he had accompanied the family hither.</P>
<P>"After &s;pending &s;ome time in a nece&s;&s;ary attention to Norris's family, which will &s;oon be at liberty, I re|turned to Margate, and from hence in a little fi&s;hing boat to this place."</P>
<P>"What an extraordinary di&s;covery!' &s;aid Barnwell, when Mental concluded.</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Mental; "and I am determined to act deci&s;ively upon it.&mdash;Where is Emery's hou&s;e?&mdash;I'll &s;ee this Middleton to-day."</P>
<P>"I will conduct you, if you plea&s;e," &s;aid Barnwell. "But, before we go, if you could be&s;tow an hour's attention upon a circum&s;tance, that involves in its con&s;equences my future de&s;tiny&mdash;."</P>

<P>WHEN Barnwell had concluded his &s;tory, having concealed nothing from Mental, but the means by which he obtained the three hundred pounds, the latter fixed his eyes upon the former, and in an affectionate tone of voice&mdash;"Beware, youth, beware!" &s;aid he. "I &s;hall think on your &s;tory: in the meantime, lead me to Middle|ton."</P>
<P>"Upon their arrival at Mr. Emery's, they were &s;urpri&s;ed to find the whole hou&s;e in confu&s;ion. Maria Freeman, who&s;e health had been &s;ome time declining, was that morning &s;o extremely indi&s;po&s;ed, as to be confined to her bed with &s;ymptoms of a de|lirious fever. Upon their entering the parlour, Mi&s;s Emery, and her mama, immediately began a mo&s;t lamentable duet upon the <HI>mon&s;trous di&s;agreeablene&s;s</HI> of people's being ill&mdash;</P>
<P>"It makes one," &s;aid Mi&s;s Emery, "&s;o vapouri&s;h, to &s;ee the old doctors, and the apothecaries, and nur&s;es!&mdash;"</P>
<P>"O! ab&s;olutely," cried her mama, "its the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive dull thing in the world!&mdash;May be &s;he may die, too!&mdash;Really, Emma, I'll return to the Pavil|ion&mdash;I do hate any thing that reminds one of one's latter end. Where's Charlotte?&mdash;I hope &s;he is not &s;o mad as to be in Mi&s;s Freeman's chamber!"</P>
<P>At that in&s;tant Charlotte entered&mdash;"So, Mr. Barnwell," &s;aid &s;he&mdash;here's havoc you've made! Why, Sir, if Mi&s;s Freeman dies, you'll be indicted for murder! She is &s;creaming after Mr. Barnwell, do you know, in &s;uch a violent manner that all the old Quizzes are frightened out of their wits."</P>
<P>"What's all this trifling?" cried Mental, &s;tarting from his chair, and thumping his oaken &s;tick on the floor. "Shew me to Captain Middleton, Sir&mdash;I did not come here to do penance, in li&s;tening to the

vapid effu&s;ions of empty heads, and iron hearts&mdash;Shew me to Middleton!"</P>
<P>The ladies were quite terrified&mdash;"Lord ble&s;s me, Mr. Barnwell," cried Mrs. Emery, "who have you brought here?"</P>
<P>"This gentleman, Madam, has very particular bu&s;ine&s;s with Captain Middleton."</P>
<P>"Do, pray, then, have the goodne&s;s to &s;hew him into the library. Mr. Emery and the Captain are both there."</P>
<P>At the door of the library Barnwell announced, that a gentleman de&s;ired to &s;ee Captain Middleton; and Mr. Emery was politely retiring&mdash;</P>
<P>"Let me reque&s;t your pre&s;ence, Sir," &s;aid Mental: "the bu&s;ine&s;s I am about to enter on requires evidence."</P>
<P>Mr. Emery returned. Captain Middleton bowed to Mental, and entreated him to &s;it.&mdash;Barnwell, by de&s;ire of the latter, al&s;o was &s;eated. After a pau&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>"Gentlemen," &s;aid Mental, "I am commi&s;&s;ioned with the execution of a mo&s;t unplea&s;ant bu&s;ine&s;s. A per&s;on, whom I &s;incerely regard, has &s;u&s;tained a mo&s;t &s;erious injury. He was unfortunately deprived, by death, of a mo&s;t amiable wife, at a period when her maternal attentions began to be loudly called for by their daughter, a beautiful girl of three years old. His affairs, about the &s;ame time, compelled this per|&s;on to leave England for &s;ome years: being unwill|ing to take his daughter with him abroad; and, hav|ing no female relative or friend with whom he could depo&s;it his heart's &s;ole trea&s;ure, he was compelled to place his child with the governe&s;s of a re&s;pectable boarding-&s;chool. Here &s;he remained, and increa&s;ed in beauty and accompli&s;hments as &s;he grew in years.</P>
<P>Well, gentlemen, her father returned, after a long ab&s;ence, to his native home, and &s;ettled in affluent cir|cum&s;tances, in a retired part of the country. Re|maining &s;till a widower, for that, and po&s;&s;ibly for other rea&s;ons, he did not immediately after his return &s;end for his daughter from the &s;eminary, where, he was convinced, &s;he was improving her&s;elf in the attain|ments adapted to her &s;ex and fortune.</P>

"Thus &s;he continued at &s;chool till &s;he was about &s;eventeen years of age. You'll &s;ay, perhaps, her fa|ther was to blame to continue the care of her, at that thoughtle&s;s &s;ea&s;on of her life, in the hands of a mere &s;chool mi&s;tre&s;s. Events have proved that it was wrong; but he, a &s;ort of a Reclu&s;e, little imagined that there were beings ba&s;e enough, among mankind, to plan the &s;low de&s;truction of innocence and beauty. We, who are men of the world, know things better, Captain Middleton. <HI>We</HI> know, that girls at the age of &s;eventeen, under no other controul than that of a negligent governe&s;s or a depraved teacher, are very <HI>comeatible</HI> articles&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">?"</P>
<P>There was an expre&s;&s;ive &s;neer that accompanied this la&s;t &s;entence, which made Middleton tremble.</P>
<P>"Sir! Eh!" cried the latter; "I don't clearly under&s;tand your drift."</P>
<P>"You will &s;oon," &s;aid Mental. "I meant mere|ly to remark on the extreme ignorance of the old fool, who could tru&s;t &s;uch a <HI>charming temptation</HI> in the way of <HI>us red coats!</HI> (for I've &s;erved, my&s;elf in the army) and then be &s;urpri&s;ed at its con&s;equences.</P>
<P>"But, to proceed with my tale. In the neigh|bourhood of this young lady's re&s;idence there was quartered a regiment of militia, which was graced by a Captain of mo&s;t elegant exterior, and perfectly <HI>ac|compli&s;hed;</HI> that is, he had run one man through the body, and wounded &s;everal; had figured in a <HI>crim. con.</HI> action, knew the u&s;e of loaded dice, and would &s;ee you a <HI>three-bottle</HI> man under the table.</P>
<P>"For the accommodation of the&s;e <HI>da&s;hing</HI> gentle|men, there are certain beings, who a&s;&s;ume to them|&s;elves the name of women; and, under the character and appearance of gentlewomen, contrive an intro|duction to the young and inexperienced part of their &s;ex, with the infernal de&s;ign of debauching their mo|rals, and rendering them an ea&s;y prey to &s;eduction. Unfortunately for my poor friend, a wretch of this de&s;cription found means to gain the confidence of his daughter, who&s;e volatile di&s;po&s;ition, and full flow of

carele&s;s &s;pirits, expo&s;ed a heart, unguarded by princi|ples, to the ea&s;y conque&s;t of this harridan.</P>
<P>"The Captain was introduced to the poor victim, as a friend of this creature's; and, to be brief, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he con&s;equences were, the ruin of the daughter, and the con&s;ummation of many mi&s;eries to the heart-broken father!"</P>
<P>"Unhappy man!" &s;aid Mr. Emery: "is he &s;till living?"</P>
<P>"You &s;hall hear," cried Mental.&mdash;"The arts of tho&s;e experienced practitioners in iniquity were &s;o refined, that the deluded girl eloped from the hou&s;e of her governe&s;s, and not one probable clue to a di&s;cov|ery was left.&mdash;You are a father, Sir; Captain Middleton, I believe, is not: but any man, who has the common feelings of his nature, may picture to him&s;elf the agony of her parent, when he heard the dread tidings of her fall, and was doomed to remain ignorant of her fate!"</P>
<P>Captain Middleton, upon whom Mental all along kept his &s;tern eyes fixed, began now to half-ri&s;e from his chair, wiped his face with his handkerchief, twirled the chain of his watch round his fingers, and betrayed various other &s;ymptoms of unea&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;Mental continued&mdash;</P>
<P>"But, gentlemen, there was an hour approaching replete with yet more piercing angui&s;h for his &s;oul. The unhappy parent lived to &s;ee that daughter&mdash;but, O, God! what a &s;ight&mdash;He beheld her, &s;uffering the la&s;t agonies of death, on the bare floor of a mean hovel, &s;urrounded by mi&s;ery and want! and whil&s;t the poi&s;on of pro&s;titution con&s;umed her frame, the horrors of reflection on a guilty cour&s;e agoni&s;ed her mind! He &s;aw her die! <HI>!</HI>&mdash;If, then, the wretched parent, at that moment, had &s;een and known the au|thor of this mi&s;ery, &s;hould you, gentlemen, have been &s;urpri&s;ed to hear, that in the phrenzy of his de&s;pair, he had imbrued his hands in the villain's blood? But 'twas not &s;o. Ere he became acquainted with the &s;tory I have related to you, his agonies had mellowed into grief, his phenzy into &s;ettled melancholy.</P>

"Meanwhile the perpetrator of this deed was bu&s;i|ly employed in fre&s;h pur&s;uits of the &s;ame nature, aid|ed by the &s;ame infernal &s;pirit, in the form of woman. Undaunted by any of the <HI>vulgar prejudices</HI> of humani|ty, or feelings; unchecked by the incommodious principles of honor, or virtue, he plunged boldly on, to pro&s;ecute the ruin of more beauty; and further to extend the de&s;olations of dome&s;tic peace&mdash;a family, rai&s;ed by his perfidious promi&s;es to the pinnacle of pro&s;perous hopes, was hurled from thence to the aby&s;s of wretchedne&s;s, poverty, and the views of endle&s;s thraldom: this was the pa&s;time of the all-daring villain!"</P>

<P>"You <HI>will</HI>&mdash;then <HI>do</HI>" &s;aid Mental. "Behold him, thou reptile! behold him here!!"</P>

<P>Middleton remained dumb. Mr. Emery, extreme|ly terrified, attempted to interpo&s;e.</P>
<P>"Silence, man," cried Mental: "You don't <HI>know me.</HI> I am not one, who frames, de&s;troys, and frames anew his re&s;olutions! I come not in the moment of pa&s;&s;ion, to wreak revenge, but calmly to inflict upon a villain the puni&s;hment of death!"</P>
<P>"You come to murder, then?" cried Emery.</P>
<P>"Sir!" &s;aid Middleton, after a long &s;truggle of cowardice&mdash;"Sir&mdash;I&mdash;&s;ee&mdash;that&mdash;you are&mdash;deter|mined, not to li&s;ten to any thing I offer in my de|fence; and, therefore, name your place, and time, and take what &s;atisfaction you plea&s;e."</P>
<P>"To-morrow, at break of day, which will be four o'clock&mdash;behind the mill, two fields from the adjoin|ing lane," &s;aid Mental, in a firm tone.</P>
<P>"I'll meet you there&mdash;" &s;aid Middleton, who, on this occa&s;ion, was indeed a coward; though, till this moment, he had always retained the credit of great courage. But there was an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;omething in the countenance of the father, which the &s;educer of the daughter trembled to gaze upon, in &s;pite of his in&s;en&s;ibility to all virtuous emotions.</P>
<P>"Shall we meet alone, or &s;hall tho&s;e who are now pre&s;ent attend us there?" a&s;ked Mental.</P>
<P>"Is it <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> to prevent this meeting?" &s;aid Emery. "Can no conce&s;&s;ions&mdash;no recompence&mdash;."</P>

<P>NO &s;ooner had Mental left the hou&s;e, than Mrs. Emery and her daughters, attended by their <HI>&s;hadows,</HI> Morley and Ea&s;twood, ru&s;hed into the library, to learn the errand of &s;o &s;trange a <HI>Quiz,</HI> as he was term|ed by Lord Morley.</P>
<P>It was in vain to attempt concealment, and there|fore, partly by Emery, partly by Middleton, and part|ly by Barnwell, the whole hi&s;tory was related of Barnwell's fir&s;t acquaintance with him&mdash;of the lo&s;s of his wife&mdash;the fate of his daughter&mdash;and the re&s;ult of that morning's vi&s;it.</P>
<P>"A duel!" Screamed Mrs. Emery. "Captain Middleton it &s;hall not take place&mdash;Run, my Lord&mdash;Run, Mr. Ea&s;twood, to that fat, ugly fellow of a ju&s;tice we &s;aw ye&s;terday; and, for heaven's &s;ake, entreat him to get all the con&s;tables in the place rea|dy to keep the peace."</P>
<P>"I in&s;i&s;t upon it, my Lord, you do not obey &s;uch orders&mdash;as you will an&s;wer to my honor. I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I, as well as many others, have been guilty of improprieties in my younger days, of which I readily acknowledge this one of the wor&s;t. As to the death of the girl, God knows, I was perfectly ignorant, and of her want, for I have not &s;een her for years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">in fact, I had almo&s;t forgotten her. The encountering the old man in this way is awkward, certainly, very awkward; but it is unavoidable."</P>
<P>"O, you cruel wretch, you," cried Mrs. Emery&mdash;"when you know the value of your life to Mr. Emery, to my&s;elf, to thou&s;ands&mdash;thus to &s;port with it! A figure like your's, Captain Middleton, to be

<P>"Lor, Ma'!" &s;aid Mi&s;s Emery&mdash;"Do you think Captain Middleton can't level a pi&s;tol better than old Mental? I have not the lea&s;t fear, but he'll kill the old brute."</P>
<P>"And then, will he not be obliged to fly the king|dom?"</P>
<P>"O, only for a little time, till its blown over?"</P>
<P>"Only look at Mr. Barnwell!" cried Charlotte, who had been watching his countenance &s;ome time: "really, now, by the exce&s;&s;ive length of his vi&s;age, one would imagine <HI>he</HI> were going to fight a duel."</P>
<P>In fact, Barnwell's mind was ab&s;orbed in very dif|ferent meditations. He was anxiou&s;ly calculating the time that had elap&s;ed &s;ince he had di&s;patched the jewels to London; and reflecting on the horrible con&s;equences, &s;hould the man prove di&s;hone&s;t. Arou&s;|ed, by this remark of Charlotte, from his reverie, he unfortunately betrayed his ab&s;ence by a &s;ham laugh, and exclaiming&mdash;"A duel! What duel?"</P>
<P>"There's a hard-hearted wretch, now!" &s;aid Char|lotte, "to laugh at &s;uch a &s;erious thing as a duel!"</P>
<P>"Whatever the event of to-morrow may be,' &s;aid Middleton, "this trifling upon the &s;ubject is unbe|coming. I have made up my mind, Madam:" [to Mrs. Emery] "I am bound in honour to give the meeting; and whoever attempts to prevent it, will throw a &s;tain upon my character, that nothing but &s;uicide will efface."</P>
<P>Mrs. Emery &s;hrieked and fainted; her daughters flew to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the party &s;eparated. Mr. Emery gave directions to Barnwell to di&s;charge &s;ome debts of Captain Middleton's, and retiring with the Captain, to arrange &s;ome mutual concerns, he de&s;ired Barnwell to let him have his accounts to examine in the evening.</P>
<P>Upon the arrival of the po&s;t, Barnwell was &s;ur|pri&s;ed to receive a letter, in a &s;trange hand writing;
<PB N="220" REF="038596_0219_1012A07417D55D38">
but his &s;urpri&s;e was &s;oon lo&s;t in &s;tupefaction when he read the contents, as follow&mdash;</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>You have been mo&s;t gro&s;sly abu&s;ed by the per&s;on, whoever it may be, that con|&s;igned the jewels to you. Their value is nothing more than the gold and &s;ilver in which they are &s;et, about &s;even or eight pounds&mdash;The &s;tones are all &s;ham&mdash;Having bu&s;ine&s;s that will keep me here a day or two longer, I thought it my duty to appri&s;e you of this affair.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, your's, TIM. BROWN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Some minutes had elap&s;ed before Barnwell remov|ed his eyes from the paper; and when he did, they were covered by a thick film, that ob&s;cured every ob|ject around him. Cold &s;weats &s;ucceeded; and he had nearly, very nearly, fainted.</P>
<P>"O, Milwood!" exclaimed he&mdash;"Milwood, thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed me!"</P>
<P>He ru&s;hed out of the hou&s;e, and immediately ran to the little cottage. Breathle&s;s and pale, he ap|proached the &s;iren, with the letter open in his hand, and gave it her to peru&s;e. With the mo&s;t complete hypocri&s;y imaginable, &s;he &s;hrieked&mdash;&s;he raved&mdash;and imprecated cur&s;es on the man, though the &s;ham jewels had been made to her own orders. She pro|te&s;ted mo&s;t &s;olemnly and impiou&s;ly called on heaven to witne&s;s her oaths, that they were her mother's jewels; and either the man, &s;he &s;aid, mu&s;t have ex|changed them, or &s;ome &s;ecret thief in her former re|&s;idences&mdash;</P>
<P>"Can my Barnwell," &s;aid &s;he, "for a moment harbour a thought &s;o much beneath his liberal na|ture to indulge, as to &s;uppo&s;e me privy to a fraud? What is there, Barnwell, in my nature like &s;uch mean di&s;hone&s;ty? Reflect, and an&s;wer, Sir, whether a per|&s;on of my &s;pirit, even were &s;he vicious, would &s;toop to the paltry pilfering tricks of a Ring-dropper?

Barnwell, it would have hurt me le&s;s, had you ac|cu&s;ed me of a murder!"</P>
<P>"Nay, Milwood," &s;aid the youth, "I have not ac|cu&s;ed you; but I am di&s;tracted by the event! What can be done? Mr. Emery has ordered me this eve|ning, this very evening, to make up my accounts.&mdash;I am lo&s;t for ever! Never more can I return to him&mdash;And whither, O, whither can I go!"</P>
<P>In the utmo&s;t agony, he threw him&s;elf into a chair, and leaned his head upon the table. Milwood, af|fecting the profounde&s;t thought, walked about the room.&mdash;"The deficiency mu&s;t not be known," cried &s;he. "We mu&s;t prevent this di&s;covery by any means."</P>
<P>"I &s;ee no po&s;&s;ible way," &s;aid Barnwell.</P>
<P>"I &s;ee but one," &s;aid &s;he; "and that you will &s;cru|ple to adopt. 'Tis indeed, one that, upon a <HI>&s;mall</HI> nece&s;&s;ity, ought not to be re&s;orted to; but when, if adopted, it will, to a certainty, prevent di&s;grace to your&s;elf and family, the utter ruin of all your future pro&s;pects, the horrors of a pri&s;on, and the character of a thief&mdash;I think, &s;elf-pre&s;ervation calls on us to adopt it."</P>
<P>"Name it," &s;aid Barnwell.</P>
<P>"FORGERY."</P>
<P>Starting from the chair, with all the wildne&s;s of de&s;pair expre&s;&s;ed in his countenance&mdash;"Wretch!&mdash;Sorcere&s;s!&mdash;Away&mdash;Away! There is a dreadful ruin waits on thy accur&s;ed beauty, and I now &s;ee it in all its horrors!"</P>
<P>He would have left the room; but Milwood, &s;eiz|ing his arm, detained him.</P>
<P>"Barnwell, were I that daemon your de&s;pair now exhibits to your mind, I &s;hould at once relinqui&s;h you. What more could &s;uch a &s;pirit wi&s;h, than that, in this di&s;ordered &s;tate, you &s;hould &s;eek your ma&s;ter.

I&mdash;innocently though it be&mdash;yet, I have been the cau&s;e of your calamities; and never, never will I yield my title to a &s;hare of the bitter draught."</P>
<P>With all the &s;ofte&s;t, tendere&s;t expre&s;&s;ions, &s;he hung upon him; &s;he embraced him, and bedewed his cheeks with her tears. The &s;oul of Barnwell was in an agony&mdash;He &s;ighed&mdash;he &s;obbed aloud&mdash;He cal|led upon his mother, his Eliza, and invoked the de|parted &s;pirit of his father to direct him!</P>
<P>"O, think upon the agonies of thy dear friends!" cried &s;he. "Can you reflect a moment on the phren&s;y that will &s;eize your venerable mother&mdash;the pangs that will rend your &s;i&s;ter's heart, when they hear a &s;on, a brother&mdash;."</P>
<P>"Hold, hold!" cried Barnwell. "They <HI>mu&s;t not, &s;hall not!</HI>&mdash;Tell me the means that can prevent di&s;covery&mdash;Quick, quick, unfold them, that, with|out the po&s;&s;ibility of a retraction, I may pledge my &s;oul's eternal welfare to their adoption!"</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;e a bill of Exchange was drawn upon Mr. Emery; &s;ay for five hundred pounds at two months, could you not imitate his acceptance?&mdash;If &s;o, I would my&s;elf undertake to negociate it; and long ere it became due we could provide means to prevent its being pre&s;ented for payment; and thus the whole tran&s;action would remain a &s;ecret within our own brea&s;ts&mdash;You he&s;itate!&mdash;"</P>
<P>"O, Milwood, what a propo&s;al! Mi&s;erable wretch, that I am, how am I fallen, that I can with patience li&s;ten to it!"</P>
<P>"Is this a time for ab&s;tract rea&s;onings? Is this a moment to moralize, Barnwell? If you are not de|termined to &s;urrender every hope&mdash;if you are deter|mined

<P>"I do not he&s;itate at the crime&mdash;for I am &s;unk beneath tho&s;e &s;cruples; but I tremble at the dread|ful con&s;equences of its di&s;covery."</P>
<P>"Ab&s;urd argument!" &s;aid Milwood. "A <HI>pre|&s;ent,</HI> an almo&s;t <HI>in&s;tant</HI> di&s;covery mu&s;t take place, if we do not re&s;ort to this, or &s;ome &s;imilar preventive.

Ruin is at the door; and you are weakly arguing, if it be wi&s;e to fly from it, becau&s;e there is a po&s;&s;ibility we may again encounter it."</P>
<P>"But," &s;aid Barnwell; "even if I were to adopt this dreadful alternative, how are you &s;ure that you could procure money for this bill?"</P>
<P>"I will engage for three hundred of the five in le&s;s than &s;ix hours time."</P>
<P>"But&mdash;But&mdash;I&mdash;cannot&mdash;it is impo&s;&s;ible!"</P>
<P>"Barnwell, this weakne&s;s is unworthy of your nature.&mdash;Determine&mdash;Are you prepared to tell Mr. Emery, that you have robbed him of three hundred pounds?&mdash;Are you prepared to meet the anger of your benefactor, the cur&s;es of a parent, the madne&s;s of your &s;i&s;ter?&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Hold&mdash;Hold&mdash;for heaven's &s;ake&mdash;or you will drive me to commit that, in de&s;peration, which, on reflection to have done, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to the grave of &s;uicide!"</P>
<P>"And rather, Barnwell, much rather, would I &s;ee you dead at my feet by your own hands, than behold you among felons at the bar of ju&s;tice, a &s;pectacle to a gaping multitude!"</P>
<P>"O, God! that mu&s;t not be!&mdash;He would not, he could not, &s;urely, proceed to &s;uch extremity!"</P>

<P>AFTER an ab&s;ence of two hours, Milwood return|ed to the cottage, where Barnwell waited in a &s;tate of mind beyond the powers of language to de&s;cribe&mdash;Guilt, terror, and remor&s;e, haunted his brea&s;t, and created there a hell torments!</P>

<P>BY a letter, the preceding evening, Mental had reque&s;ted Barnwell to be with him by three o'clock on the morning of the duel. He was punctual to the hour. He found that extraordinary man clam and more collected in his manner and &s;peech than he had ever beheld him. There were two packets lying on a table, which he pointed out to Barnwell.</P>
<P>"Uncertain of the events of the next hour," &s;aid he, "I have prepared either for death or flight. If I &s;hould fall, let <HI>this</HI> packet be opened immediately after my remains are brought hither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it contains directions for the di&s;po&s;al of my property.

<P>The &s;tate of Barnwell's mind was ill adapted to remon&s;trate at that time, even could he have imagin|ed remon&s;trance of the lea&s;t avail with &s;uch a man as Mental. Much, indeed, he wi&s;hed to relate to him how far he had him&s;elf deviated from the paths of rectitude; much he wi&s;hed to declare the horrors of remor&s;e, and fears of di&s;grace, that tortured his af|flicted &s;oul; but the &s;olemnity of the hour forbid him. He could not di&s;turb the tranquillity of Mental's bo|&s;om at a time, when, of all others, it became him, if po&s;&s;ible, to increa&s;e it.</P>
<P>As they were walking towards the field, Mental, gazing round upon the opening beauties of the morn|ing &s;cene, &s;aid&mdash;</P>
<P>"In a little time, probably, this va&s;t and wond|rous Theatre of Nature will be for ever &s;hut to me! and what &s;hall &s;ucceed it?&mdash;Vain inquiry! That &s;omething will &s;ucceed, I <HI>feel</HI>&mdash;for nature &s;hudders at the idea of total annihilation. Nor is this longing, anxious hope of "living-on," the mere effect of edu|cation, as I my&s;elf once thought. The <HI>various pro&s;|pects</HI> of that Future may, and doubtle&s;s do, receive their &s;everal colorings from education; but the ex|pectation of <HI>&s;ome hereafter,</HI> &s;eems to me, upon mature con&s;ideration of all opinions, and a &s;crupulous inve&s;ti|gation of my own thoughts, to be the <HI>only innate idea</HI> of Man, a univer&s;al principle implanted by the common Parent, and influencing, under various forms, the ten|ants of each quarter of the globe. But beyond this conviction, the powers of <HI>my</HI> mind do not go one &s;tep. In England, this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uturity is repre&s;ented in one form to our &s;en&s;es; in Turkey, it a&s;&s;umes another; in Hindo&s;tan, another; and among the Africans, ano|ther &s;till; and he who, dwelling under either di&s;pen|&s;ation, is ignorant of any other, feels no difficulty in

blending his <HI>belief</HI> of what he <HI>hears</HI> with the <HI>conviction</HI> of what he <HI>feels.</HI> Not &s;o the man of more enlightened mind; who, unblinded by prejudice, &s;urveys the nu|merous creeds of various nations. He he&s;itates, ere he can affix to any little &s;pot on earth, the <HI>Divine</HI> Revela|tion of Futurity; and ri&s;ing &s;uperior to the little|ne&s;s of &s;elf, inquires how he may reconcile the Ju&s;|tice of Omnipotence with &s;o confined a notion.&mdash;Hence, he no longer broods o'er forms and ceremo|nies; he cea&s;es to let down the energies of thought to &s;illy &s;crutinies of trivial exteriors; but, unfettering his &s;oul from chains of human workman&s;hip, gives it bold flight, e'en to the &s;tretch of Rea&s;on. In con&s;e|quence, he acts, he &s;peaks, he thinks&mdash;deeds, words, and thoughts, truly his own.</P>
<P>"One error generally accompanies this originality of mind, from which I have been far from free&mdash;"forgetfulne&s;s of the general &s;tate of mankind"&mdash;which calls for the <HI>&s;low</HI> and <HI>gradual</HI> removal of the veil of prejudices, and on which too &s;udden a glare of light mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce effects, the very op|po&s;ite to tho&s;e intended by the benevolence of true philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>"A deep con&s;ideration of this fact has made me lament having publi&s;hed &s;ome &s;trong truths, which have un&s;ettled many minds from that foundation on which they had re&s;ted, ere any new and more &s;olid ba&s;e was formed for their &s;upport; and has con|firmed me &s;trongly in the opinion, that REFORMA|TION is much better adapted to the purpo&s;es of phi|lanthropy than the be&s;t planned REVOLUTION. I feel a relief to my mind, in making this free apology for my own conduct, and &s;incere confe&s;&s;ion of my &s;entiments, at this time, mo&s;t probably &s;o near my <HI>exit</HI> from the&s;e &s;cenes. And permit me, my young friend, earne&s;tly to recommend to your remembrance, that, at the clo&s;ing hour of his life, there was nothing &s;o anxiou&s;ly employed the thoughts of Mental, as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> future effects of tho&s;e doctrines, which he had pro|mulgated

among mankind. May it impre&s;s upon your mind a caution, which will mo&s;t carefully regu|late the propagation of your &s;entiments, and even the effu&s;ions of your fancy."</P>
<P>This &s;ermon (for &s;uch the &s;olemnity of Mental's manner made it appear) fini&s;hed, as they were within &s;ight of the mill.&mdash;They had not arrived three mi|nutes before they were joined by Captain Middleton and Mr. Emery. The paces were mea&s;ured, the pi&s;|tols loaded, and the antagoni&s;ts took the ground. The &s;urpri&s;e which had made a coward of Middleton, had worn away, and he now re&s;umed that courage for which he was celebrated. They were to fire to|gether, at a &s;ignal from Mr. Emery. The word was given&mdash;Mental's ball grazed the &s;houlder of Captain Middleton, who fired in the air.</P>
<P>"How is this?" exclaimed Mental&mdash;"why did you fire in the air?"</P>
<P>"Having received your fire, Sir," &s;aid the Captain. "I pre&s;ume I may now, without the imputation of cowardice, &s;olicit your attention for a few minutes to &s;ome ob&s;ervations I would offer. When you have heard me, it &s;hall remain for your deci&s;ion, whether this affair &s;hall proceed. If it is your wi&s;h to fire again, I &s;hall think my&s;elf ju&s;tified in returning it, after the explanation I may offer, and the &s;atisfaction I have already afforded by receiving your ball."</P>
<P>"I cannot refu&s;e to hear you, Sir; but our &s;itua|tion requires you &s;hould be brief."</P>
<P>"If I could prove, from the mo&s;t certain evi|dences," &s;aid the Captain, "that your daughter lives&mdash;."</P>
<P>"My daughter lives!" exclaimed Mental, &s;tart|ing.&mdash;P&s;ha, p&s;ha, p&s;ha!&mdash;I &s;aw her die&mdash;I &s;aw the earth receive her poor remains into its bo&s;om! Why, then, this paltry eva&s;ion?"</P>
<P>"I am patient," &s;aid the Captain, "I bear with the effu&s;ions of your &s;orrow&mdash;but, believe me, Sir,&mdash;if the unfortunate girl, whom the madne&s;s of de&s;ire urged me to &s;educe, and who&s;e name was Mental,

<P>"Saw her la&s;t night!" echoed Mental, cla&s;ping his hands together&mdash;"I hope not&mdash;No, no&mdash;it cannot be&mdash;I &s;aw her die."</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t have been deceived, Sir, by &s;ome &s;trong re&s;emblance of per&s;on, or &s;ome &s;triking coin|cidence of circum&s;tances&mdash;for, by Heaven, I repeat, Mi&s;s Mental lives!"</P>
<P>"Wonderful, wonderful!" &s;aid Mental, in a voice barely audible, with his folded hands placed to his eyes.</P>
<P>"After the &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of her death, which you have received," &s;aid the Captain, "nothing will, perhaps, convince you of her exi&s;tence, unle&s;s you were to &s;ee her."</P>
<P>"See her! &s;ee her!" exclaimed Mental, fearfully looking around him!&mdash;"Is &s;he near me?&mdash;I would rather embrace the &s;evere&s;t tortures Cruelty ere fram|ed!&mdash;See her!&mdash;horrible!&mdash;horrible!"</P>
<P>As he cea&s;ed, the teeth chattered in his head, and his whole frame was convul&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Your arm, my friend," continued he, to Barn|well. "I am faint."</P>
<P>He reclined his head on Barnwell's &s;houlder. Mr. Emery then advanced, and propo&s;ed retiring to his hou&s;e, that Captain Middleton might relate the di&s;|covery of the preceding evening, from which Mr. Mental might draw his own conclu&s;ions. He &s;ub|mitted; and by a &s;low walk they arrived there. Men|tal a&s;ked for a gla&s;s of water, and, after taking it, reque&s;ted Captain Middleton to proceed.</P>
<P>"It is a very con&s;iderable time, Sir," &s;aid the Cap|tain, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Mi&s;s Mental and my&s;elf &s;eparated&mdash;I would, if po&s;&s;ible, avoid &s;hocking your mind; but I am compelled to &s;ay, that Elinor's infidelity was the cau&s;e."</P>
<P>"Facts, facts, Sir, if you plea&s;e, and &s;pare your comments," &s;aid Mental.</P>
<P>"Since our &s;eparation, I under&s;tand, &s;he vi&s;ited

Rome, Florence, and &s;everal of the Italian States, in company with a young nobleman, whom, at length, &s;he left, and &s;unk into that way of living."</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand, Sir&mdash;" interrupted Mental&mdash;"Pray, go on."</P>
<P>"From that period, till la&s;t night, I have remain|ed ignorant of her entirely. In con&s;equence of the intended meeting of this morning, I had occa&s;ion for my attorney. Fortunately, I learnt he was in Ram&s;|gate, and he waited on me. The cau&s;e of our meet|ing, of cour&s;e, was mentioned; when to my a&s;toni&s;h|ment, he declared, your daughter was at that moment alive, and in Ram&s;gate! He cannot be deceived, for he knew her as early as my&s;elf, and has corre&s;ponded with her ever &s;ince."</P>
<P>"In Ram&s;gate!" muttered Mental; "&s;o near me, too!"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied the Captain. "She re&s;ides in a &s;mall cottage near the &s;ea, and a&s;&s;umes the name of Milwood."</P>
<P>Barnwell turned pale as the dead; his knees &s;hook, and his head &s;unk upon his brea&s;t. Mental, almo&s;t as much affected, had yet more pre&s;ence of mind; and &s;aid, with particular empha&s;is; <HI>We</HI> mu&s;t inquire into this&punc; and endeavour to <HI>conceal our emotions for the pre&s;ent."</HI></P>
<P>Barnwell took the hint; and continuing to hold down his head, made every exertion in his power to &s;creen his a&s;toni&s;hment from ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>"Where is this attorney, Sir," &s;aid Mental.</P>
<P>"In this hou&s;e," replied the Captain. "Hoping to gain your attention, I reque&s;ted he would be ready to corroborate, by his te&s;timony, what I have a&s;&s;erted. I will &s;tep for him."</P>
<P>"Nay, Sir," &s;aid Mental; "<HI>I</HI> will examine him in private. Lead me to him."</P>
<P>This manoeuvre of Mental's, to prevent the meeting of Blackmore and Barnwell, was truly acceptable to the latter, who would, mo&s;t probably, have been be|trayed by the pre&s;ence of Blackmore, into a prema|ture confe&s;&s;ion of his connection.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="038596_0232_1012A09892F4F760">
The time that Mental was out of the room, was occupied by the ob&s;ervations of Mr. Emery and Mid|dleton on this di&s;covery; whil&s;t Barnwell's mind was ab&s;orbed in contemplating the con&s;equences it would produce.</P>
<P>At length Mental returned, and, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Captain Middleton&mdash;</P>
<P>"I am convinced," &s;aid he, "from the narrative of this man, that &s;he, over who&s;e grave I have wept, was not my daughter.

<P>"O, Sir!" exclaimed Barnwell, with a heart too full for further utterance.</P>

<P>"Hold&mdash;hold!" &s;aid Barnwell.

overtures of reconciliation on my part, but in&s;olent denials? The delight that &s;wells the bo&s;oms of the parent and the child, is virtuous joy! The &s;miles of a father, is bli&s;s un&s;peakable to a virtuous brea&s;t; but, to a corrupted heart, is as the &s;ight of heaven to the fallen angels!"</P>
<P>Barnwell li&s;tened mo&s;t attentively.</P>
<P>"If, indeed, you are pur&s;uaded," &s;aid he, "that &s;he is &s;o far abandoned, which I, who have &s;o lately &s;een her, cannot allow, yet, even then, admitting &s;he &s;purned all overtures of a father's aid in a return to virtue, would not the thought, that <HI>you had offered it,</HI> afford &s;ome con&s;olation?"</P>
<P>Mental &s;tarted, and pau&s;ed a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>"No, no&mdash;it mu&s;t not be," cried he. "Your &s;ug|ge&s;tion &s;truck me for the moment; but, upon con|&s;ideration. I am convinced it would prove a fruitle&s;s offer, and only add to her de&s;pair."</P>
<P>"Still you argue," &s;aid Barnwell, "on the ground, that &s;he is irreparably lo&s;t. If you could &s;ee her&mdash;if you but heard her &s;entiments&mdash;."</P>
<P>"Deception is her trade," cried Mental. "But, yet, I am half inclined to &s;ee her."</P>
<P>"O, do!" cried Barnwell, with quickne&s;s.</P>
<P>"If I were &s;ure &s;he would not know me&mdash;And &s;o little re&s;emblance to the portrait do I now bear, that, I think, it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could&mdash;I would &s;ee her."</P>
<P>"Obey this impul&s;e, Sir&mdash;it is the voice of nature, and I will hope the happie&s;t effects. She mu&s;t, &s;he &s;hall, prove virtuous yet; for 'tis in vain to talk of tearing from your heart her lovely image!"</P>
<P>"Softly youth," cried Mental. "Let not pa&s;&s;ion bear away remembrance. Grant that we &s;ucceeded to our utmo&s;t hopes; what would follow&mdash;but that &s;he &s;hould for&s;ake the throngs of &s;ociety, and in the &s;olitude of retirement calm the tumultuous &s;ea of pa&s;&s;ions that rages in her bo&s;om. You do not, &s;ure|ly, for a moment, Barnwell, think of renewing a connection with a common pro&s;titute!"</P>
<P>"Do I hear you, Sir!" cried Barnwell, his cheeks
<PB N="237" REF="038596_0236_1012A0A44169E0A0">
tinged with a ro&s;y glow, his brea&s;t heaving with the impetuo&s;ity of youthful pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;"Was it Mr. Mental that I heard? Impo&s;&s;ible! 'Twas the croak|ing voice of Prejudice, that blended the &s;uppo&s;ition of returning virtue and a hiding-place together. A MONK could not preach otherwi&s;e, indeed! But I di&s;dain the notion. O, were Milwood virtuous <HI>now,</HI> not all the &s;creams and howlings of a wondering world &s;hould fright me from her arms!"</P>
<P>"Youth," cried Mental, with an expre&s;&s;ive gaze&mdash;"Youth, I admire and tremble&mdash;Hear my determination:&mdash;The attorney Blackmore is com|pletely in my power&mdash;&s;ome practices, of which he was guilty in the affairs of Norris, would tran&s;port him. On his lips, therefore, I have a &s;eal. My daughter is ignorant of the duel, and its cau&s;es; &s;he will remain &s;o. Could it, then, be contrived to ad|mit me, for a day or two, as a friend of your's, into her company&mdash;by which means I might judge of her for my&s;elf, and act accordingly?"</P>
<P>"Nothing more ea&s;y," &s;aid Barnwell. "You might, for a few days, occupy a room in the cottage. 'Tis an excellent thought; and I cheri&s;h the &s;tronge&s;t hope of its &s;ucce&s;s."</P>
<P>After &s;everal ob&s;tacles were removed, this plan was re&s;olved on, and Barnwell went to prepare for its execution.</P>
<P>Milwood had &s;carcely ri&s;en, when Barnwell enter|ed the cottage. Surpri&s;ed at &s;o early a vi&s;it, the fir&s;t thought that occurred to her was, that the forgery had been already detected, though Blackmore, in who&s;e hands &s;he placed the note, had declared he would not negociate it for at lea&s;t a month; in which period &s;he propo&s;ed the conclu&s;ion of her &s;chemes on Barnwell. She was agreeably di&s;appointed, therefore, when he acquainted her with the nature of his errand; de&s;cribing Mental as an old gentleman from whom he had con&s;iderable expectations, who wi&s;hed to re&s;ide &s;ome time at Ram&s;gate incog. It was &s;ettled, that a bed &s;hould be prepared for him by

the evening. Influenced, as it was, by contending emotions, Barnwell's behaviour did not e&s;cape the penetration of Milwood.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Are you unwell, Barnwell?" &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>"No," replied he.</P>
<P>"Your mind is unea&s;y, then?"</P>
<P>"What &s;hould make it &s;o?&mdash;Do I not po&s;&s;e&s;s your love&mdash;your whole heart?&mdash;Milwood, you never loved another as you love me!"</P>
<P>"Never. But why that que&s;tion?"</P>
<P>"There are others of the name of Milwood in the world, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e; or el&s;e calumny has been bu&s;y with your's!"</P>
<P>"Who dare calumniate my character?" and &s;he blu&s;hed deeply.</P>
<P>"Nay, I did not &s;ay 'twas yours. But my friend, whom you will &s;ee to-night, &s;oon as I mentioned the name of Milwood, and expre&s;&s;ed to him (for he is my &s;econd &s;elf) the nature of our connection, &s;tarted, and then detailed &s;ome tales that he had heard of <HI>one</HI> Milwood. But they could not relate to you."&mdash;</P>
<P>"'Twas not kind, Sir, to refu&s;e my poor reque&s;t of &s;ecre&s;y for a few more days; but to convince you how &s;uperior I feel to any tale of calumny, I am glad your friend is coming. He will not &s;cruple to repeat it, I &s;hould hope."</P>
<P>"I never knew him &s;hrink from his own act."</P>
<P>Enough had pa&s;&s;ed to convince Milwood &s;he was &s;u&s;pected. When, therefore, Barnwell prepared to take leave, &s;he made no attempt to detain him; but immediately after his departure went in &s;earch of Blackmore, and challenged him with treachery: he, from a dread of Mental, per&s;i&s;ted to the contrary; and declared, that he had not uttered a &s;yllable con|cerning her. De&s;titute of any other good of &s;u&s;pi|cion, &s;he now turned her thoughts again towards this &s;tranger, and prepared her&s;elf for a detection. Summoning to her aid all the powers &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;he waited with con&s;iderable anxiety his arrival.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE mind of Barnwell began now to a&s;&s;ume a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t, which ju&s;tly to delineate is beyond the be&s;t efforts of the mo&s;t brilliant powers of de&s;cription. The rapid progre&s;s of intere&s;ting events, in which he had been chief actor, &s;eemed now to have attained their climax. Left to his own reflections for a time, the con&s;equences of that morning's di&s;covery pa&s;&s;ed in a dreadful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion before his imagination.</P>
<P>"Milwood!"&mdash;would he murmer&mdash;"Milwood!&mdash;My&s;terious being! I am lo&s;t in unravelling her ac|tions! what but love can have impelled her to &s;uch a &s;eries of impo&s;tures?&mdash;A pro&s;titute! is not the end of &s;uch lo&s;t women&mdash;Gain&mdash;Sub&s;i&s;tence? Has &s;uch been Milwood's!&mdash;Have I not offered her my hand?&mdash;Might &s;he not have been my wife, with half the efforts that it has co&s;t her to procure five hun|dred pounds? Be&s;ides, has &s;he not &s;hared the crime, and con&s;equent hazard of detection and death? Had &s;he, when &s;he obtained that &s;um, fled from the reach of ju&s;tice, I could at once decide upon her motives, But, no.&mdash;Jewels, which &s;he imagined worth more than that &s;um, were in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;the&s;e &s;he parted with:&mdash;for what?&mdash;To purcha&s;e a re|lea&s;e from her hu&s;band!&mdash;Has &s;he, then, a hu&s;band? If not, why pretend &s;o? Then, her uncle! If &s;he is, indeed, Mental's daughter, &s;he, can have no uncle. Blackmore, too!&mdash;the creature of Middleton!&mdash;He, it &s;eems, is the di&s;coverer of this lo&s;t daughter; and he finds her&mdash;in Milwood&mdash;who&s;e hu&s;band, he pre|tended, was his client!&mdash;By heavens, 'tis a con|&s;piracy&mdash;a juggle!&mdash;But how to detect it? To|night's interview will probably throw &s;ome light on this my&s;terious bu&s;ine&s;s; but to me, it &s;eems im|po&s;&s;ible &s;he can be Mental's daughter!"</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="038596_0239_1012A0AD18DEBAD0">
To the&s;e reflections &s;ucceeded others, re&s;pecting that dreadful act to which the &s;iren had urged him.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Forgery!" exclaimed he to him&s;elf. "Who, I&mdash;I commit a forgery!&mdash;Spirit of my father, did you &s;ee the deed?&mdash;Where is the fatal paper?&mdash;Perhaps, ere this, detected, traced!&mdash;And <HI>who,</HI> cries an inquiring world, <HI>who</HI> was the villain?&mdash;Horrible, horrible!&mdash;Three hundred pounds may yet re|deem it. I'll in&s;tantly a&s;k it of Mr. Emery. Why do I he&s;itate?&mdash;My embarra&s;&s;ment will betray me.&mdash;Shall I, then, acknowledge to him, in time, what I have done? Coward, that I am, my heart &s;inks at the idea! The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Mental, at this moment, render it cruelty to obtrude another's mi&s;eries up|on him.&mdash;My uncle!&mdash;my mother!&mdash;Gracious God! it would be parricide to let them know that I am &s;uch a villain!"</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t di&s;tracted &s;tate of mind he pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the day; &s;eeking every opportunity of &s;olitude, dreading the glance of every eye, &s;tarting at every foot&s;tep; retracing, with an aching heart, the pa&s;t, and contemplating the future, almo&s;t with de&s;pair!</P>
<P>Evening arrived. He repaired to Mental, who awaited his call to accompany him to Milwood's cottage, having di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in the habit of an Hanoverian, in which he had formerly travelled.</P>
<P>"Now for an effort, young friend," &s;aid he. "But, methinks, you do not brave this warfare of the pa&s;|&s;ions with the fortitude that becomes you:&mdash;your brow is marked with grief; your eye lowers, and you &s;igh! Come, come&mdash;be more your&s;elf! One in|terview, mo&s;t probably, will announce the future de&s;tinies of us both. I tremble for my&s;elf; and yet I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> act the hero for your example. Should &s;he re&s;emble her mother!&mdash;But, come&mdash;the eve|ning is advanced.</P>
<P>Barnwell bowed in &s;ilence, and they &s;et forward for the cottage.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Milwood had not been idle.
<PB N="241" REF="038596_0240_1012A0AFF0D8CA90">
Every channel of inquiry had been drained. Black|more had been entreated, and threatened, in vain; he had di&s;clo&s;ed nothing, and the re&s;ult of all her indu&s;try was vague uncertainty, as to the expected &s;tranger. She did not fail, however, to make &s;uch preparations as might evince to Barnwell her de&s;ire to plea&s;e. The entertainment that &s;he provided for his friend was deficient in nothing that her &s;ituation permitted her to procure.</P>
<P>Mental and Barnwell arrived. She &s;aw them open a wicket gate, at the entrance of a gravel walk that led to the cottage door. She placed her&s;elf to receive them. Mental &s;tarted at the thre&s;hold, and retired a pace or two&mdash;It <HI>was</HI> his daughter that he beheld; and in <HI>her</HI> he &s;aw her unfortunate mother! To &s;creen his confu&s;ion, Barnwell attracted the at|tention of Milwood, by &s;aying&mdash;"This is Mr. Townley, whom I mentioned this morning. Cir|cum&s;tances rendering a temporary concealment nece&s;&s;ary, he has cho&s;en this di&s;gui&s;e to in&s;ure it." Milwood, having &s;urveyed the &s;tranger circum&s;pect|ly, &s;aid&mdash;"As the friend of my Barnwell, Sir, you are welcome: acquaintance, I doubt not, will teach me to re&s;pect you on your own account."</P>
<P>Mental bowed, and, in a faltering voice, re|plied&mdash;"I am a plain man, Madam, and too much out of humour with my own de&s;tiny to accommodate my mu&s;cles to a &s;mile of gallantry; but, I thank you, and, rough as my manners may appear to you, I &s;hall not be <HI>an in&s;en&s;ible ob&s;erver of your actions.</HI> My young friend has, I pre&s;ume, acquainted you with my cu&s;|toms, which to you may wear the &s;emblance of capri|cious whims; but, 'twas upon the a&s;&s;urance of your compliance with them that I trouble you with my company for a day or two.</P>
<P>"In the fir&s;t place, I mu&s;t entreat you to forbear all tho&s;e obtru&s;ive attentions, called civility, or po|litene&s;s. I can't bear teazing; my nerves are irrita|ble. Thus if I choo&s;e to &s;pend my day in my chamber, you will not be rapping at my door, with
<PB N="242" REF="038596_0241_1012A0B187757450">
&s;illy importunities to &s;ee your garden, or to walk, or ride, thinking that I am too much alone; and &s;uch frivolity. I hate it. Again, if &s;ometimes a &s;trange ejaculation pa&s;s my lips, don't lift your hands and eyes to heaven with &s;tupid admiration; nor cry&mdash;'Sir!&mdash;what did you &s;ay?' In &s;hort, however I may demean my&s;elf, be this your rule&mdash;that as I have capacity and will, &s;o let that will be free. Now, by your leave, I'll to my bed at once."</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t, in all re&s;pects comply with my friend's wi&s;hes; and cannot better &s;hew our willingne&s;s to plea&s;e, than by forbearance to expre&s;s as much," &s;aid Barnwell.</P>
<P>"'Tis an early hour to retire," &s;aid Milwood; "but, knowing your inclination, I willingly com|ply."</P>
<P>Barnwell conducted him to a &s;mall chamber. Mental gra&s;ped his hand&mdash;"We mu&s;t not talk," &s;aid he, in a whi&s;per. "My pen &s;hall do the office of my tongue. Stay not here to night. Suffice it, for the pre&s;ent <HI>That I have &s;een my daughter!</HI>&mdash;Go, or we &s;hall awake &s;u&s;picion. In the morning be here, and I will contrive to &s;lip into your hand, un|noticed, my written ob&s;ervations. Farewell&mdash;Be re&s;olute." Upon his return to Milwood, &s;he over|whelmed him with que&s;tions re&s;pecting the &s;tranger: and Barnwell was compelled to pre&s;evere in fal&s;e|hoods. Among other que&s;tions which &s;he put to him&mdash;"Is he rich?" &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>"Very rich." &s;aid Barnwell.</P>
<P>"And who are his heirs?"</P>
<P>"He has none; nor, at pre&s;ent, any friend but me."</P>
<P>"Then you would, mo&s;t probably, inherit all his wealth, were he to die."</P>
<P>"Di&s;tant, far di&s;tant, be the day of his death!" cried Barnwell; "though ten times his wealth &s;hould be mine at that period."</P>
<P>Milwood pondered a moment; and her expre&s;&s;ive eyes proclaimed &s;ome mighty purpo&s;e was ju&s;t then
<PB N="243" REF="038596_0242_1012A0B5B91D4EB0">
generated in her brain. Barnwell ob&s;erved it not. She made no effort to detain him, when he tool his leave, but &s;uffered him to depart, with the promi&s;e of an early vi&s;it in the morning&punc; The in&s;tant he was gone, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her maid for the evening; and, &s;hutting her&s;elf in her chamber, committed the offspring of her mind to paper, in the form of a letter to the Chevalier Zelotti, an Italian, whom &s;he met at Bologna. It is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that this Italian was the wretch who had put the fini&s;hing touches to the character of Milwood, who&s;e real hi&s;tory this is the proper period for di&s;clo&s;ing.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to retrace the &s;ubject father back than her elopement, from Mrs. Orme's academy, with Captain Middleton. At that epoch &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the levity of youth, uncontrouled by principles of any &s;olidity. E&s;tranged from her parents, &s;he felt for them, or their memory, no regard. Her heart wanted an attachment, and Captain Middleton, aided by the infamous Ma&s;ters, accompli&s;hed her ruin with ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Her re&s;idence, whil&s;t &s;he continued with Middleton, was principally at Tunbridge Wells; where, grow|ing &s;atiated with his object, Middleton de&s;erted her. She flew to Mrs. Ma&s;ters, and, having made her election for her future cour&s;e of life, that woman in&s;tructed her in many of the arts nece&s;&s;ary for the profe&s;&s;ion &s;he had cho&s;en.</P>
<P>'Twas at this period &s;he formed an acquaintance with the &s;on of the Earl of&mdash;, and accompanied him, through the connivance of his tutor, in a tour to &s;everal of the courts of Europe. During the period of this connection, &s;he had ample opportu|nities of ob&s;erving the amazing di&s;parity of doctrines and practice among the clergy of the church of Rome; a circum&s;tance that unhappily rivetted that di&s;gu&s;t &s;he had cheri&s;hed for religion in general.</P>
<P>At Bologna, the young nobleman, her patron, con|tinued a con&s;iderable time, in con&s;equence of numerous recommendations to the nobility there, &s;everal of
<PB N="244" REF="038596_0243_1012A0B9DE0C1F98">
whom were allied to the maternal branches of his fa|mily. Here it was that the Chevalier Zelotti fir&s;t pre&s;ented him&s;elf to Milwood. She conceived a vi|olent attachment to his per&s;on, almo&s;t at fir&s;t &s;ight, and a &s;hort acquaintance gave birth to a reciprocation of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Intrigue, in Italy, is one of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of life; and the &s;imilarity of un&s;hackled &s;entiment &s;oon re|moved every ob&s;tacle to the gratification of their de|&s;ires. The &s;ame contempt for the laws which govern &s;ociety, the &s;ame ridicule of &s;cruples under the name of prejudices, the &s;ame unlimited gratification of their own wills, actuated Zelotti and Milwood. The mind of Milwood was &s;trong and ma&s;culine; but Zelotti, in addition to natural &s;trength of intellect, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the advantage of experience; having received a Monki&s;h education; having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years in the army; and having been employed as private &s;ecreta|ry to a nobleman, who was &s;ome time amba&s;&s;ador at Venice.</P>
<P>When Milwood was obliged either to accompany the young dupe of her charms to England, or di&s;cov|er her infidelity, and remain with Zelotti, it was agreed in con&s;ultation to prefer the former, under an engagement from Zelotti to vi&s;it her in England, as &s;oon as his finances enabled him. They &s;eparated, but their corre&s;pondence had ever &s;ince remained un|broken.</P>
<P>The Earl of&mdash;died &s;oon after the return of his &s;on from the Continent, who, &s;ucceeding to the title and e&s;tate, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his former connections, and &s;hortly after married.</P>
<P>At this period Milwood became di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and was compelled, for a time, to accept the friendly offers of the unhappy Ellen, who&s;e acquaintance &s;he had acci|dentally acquired; and being &s;eized with a lingering illne&s;s, was almo&s;t reduced to want. Then it was that the portrait of her father was di&s;po&s;ed of by her friend, which circum&s;tance led Mental to the conclu|&s;ion of her death.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="038596_0244_1012A0BB7016D638">
In the mean time, Zelotti had &s;o well played his game in Italy, that he married the dowager of a Flo|rentine merchant, of immen&s;e property, with whom he re&s;ided a &s;hort period; and then, by the aid of poi&s;on, di&s;encumbered the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;he brought him from their unwelcome clogg. He had, however, ex|changed his pa&s;&s;ion for Milwood for a new face, which pre&s;ented it&s;elf in the per&s;on of a native of Florence, of mean extraction, who willingly accom|panied a man of his wealth to England.</P>
<P>Their letters mutually acquainted them with each other's &s;ituation, and the utmo&s;t freedom was u&s;ed by both. Milwood did not di&s;dain to accept the pecu|niary a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he wanted, and the liberality of Ze|lotti rai&s;ed her from di&s;tre&s;s. Her indi&s;po&s;ition was of the mo&s;t lingering nature; and &s;he pa&s;&s;ed many months without the hope of recovery.</P>
<P>During the whole of this period &s;he re&s;ided at Southampton, with Zelotti and his mi&s;tre&s;s; and, if the word is not di&s;honored by the u&s;e, they lived in habits of unbounded friend&s;hip, without the return of pa&s;&s;ion. As the health of Milwood returned, how|ever, her charms once more appeared, and tho&s;e de|&s;ires revived &s;trongly in her bo&s;om, which &s;he had ne|ver aimed to controul.</P>
<P>In this cri&s;is of her hi&s;tory &s;he learnt from Zelotti the character of Mr. Emery, who was then at South|ampton, and had actually re&s;olved upon a conque&s;t there; when, from the &s;ame &s;ource, &s;he gathered the intelligence of Barnwell's innocence and inexperi|ence, and without a moment's he&s;itation changed her intention. The &s;ucce&s;s of her attempts are thus far known. The letter to Zelotti runs thus:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>He is this in&s;tant gone.&mdash;The &s;tranger, I mentioned in my la&s;t letter, &s;leeps at this moment in the room above that in which I now write. He appears an original. If his hi&s;tory is to be obtained, you know me too well to doubt my in|du&s;try. He is rich, Zelotti&mdash;very rich; and Barn|well, to a certainty, his inheritor.</P>

What idea a&s;&s;ociates it&s;elf with this information in <HI>your</HI> brain? When we fir&s;t &s;ketched the outlines of our plan, at Southampton, Sir James Barnwell's death, you recollect, was decided. Would not old Townley's wealth buy the &s;ame plea&s;ures as old Barn|well's?

<P>To accompli&s;h our original de&s;ign I begin to think it a work of greater labor than we imagined. The expence and plans we have already encountered have not been trifling. Blackmore's charges for the bu&s;ine&s;s at Brompton are enormous; and hitherto we have received in return, nothing. The forged acceptance for five hundred has co&s;t us three, and can only be u&s;ed as an incentive to that act, from which the fruits of all our labours are to re&s;ult.&mdash;Should the young &s;inner di&s;appoint us there, a <HI>very fruitful</HI> enterprize it will prove!</P>
<P>Zelotti, I have ever held thee a ma&s;ter in thine art; but, really, the arrangements in this affair add nothing to thy fame!&mdash;the jewel &s;cheme excepted (for which I thank you:)&mdash;the other branches of your plan I have been &s;o frequently compelled to al|ter, that, intoxicated with pa&s;&s;ion as Barnwell is, I wonder at the blindne&s;s, which has not, more than once, detected contradictions ab&s;olutely glaring.&mdash;Here is an opportunity of retrieving your eminence, in my opinion. Exert it, man.</P>
<P>There is a &s;ort of lethargy, I have ob&s;erved of late, from your epi&s;tles, has &s;eized thee, my Zelotti. Arou&s;e tho&s;e drow&s;y faculties the hand of nature &s;o profu&s;ely has be&s;towed. Look round thee, man, and mark the eagar zeal with which the plodding dupes of laws and &s;y&s;tems run in their limited pur&s;uits; their cour&s;e hedged in on either hand by rules and cu&s;toms, and bounded by a cowardice of con&s;cience. Yet how many of this de&s;cription are there, who ama&s;s wealth, gain honor, and are borne upon the &s;houlders of the crowd! What, then, &s;hould be their

<P>Think on this, Zelotti; and &s;ay, if this old Townley mu&s;t mu&s;t not be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;cenes of men?&mdash;Devi&s;e &s;ome &s;afe and certain means of doing this, and of en&s;uring to our&s;elves the advantage of his death.</P>

<P>AT the re&s;idence of Mr. Emery a general joy di&s;|played it&s;elf for the &s;afety of the Captain; and Barn|well was tormented with que&s;tions concerning the old Quiz, as Mental was denominated by the young ladies. Mrs. Emery her&s;elf &s;ummoned him to her dre&s;&s;ing-room, and tortured him with an hour's con|ver&s;ation on that &s;ubject; and on another which oc|ca&s;ioned him much pain.</P>
<P>"And &s;o," &s;aid &s;he, "the brute won't &s;ee his <HI>crea|ture</HI> of a daughter, though he made &s;uch a <HI>fu&s;s</HI> about her, and ab&s;olutely frightened one to death with his challenge!&mdash;Well&mdash;let's hear no more of the wretch!&mdash;But, my dear Barnwell," continued &s;he, "I have another and much more important affair to mention to you&mdash;an affair of the heart! I &s;hall be as candid as po&s;&s;ibly one can on a &s;ubject of &s;uch exce&s;|&s;ive
<PB N="248" REF="038596_0247_1012A0C4B038E8E0">
delicacy; and I am amazingly much deceived, if I do not meet in a mind like your's, <HI>&s;u&s;ceptible of tender impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> and alive to <HI>tho&s;e delicate &s;en&s;ations,</HI> as I may &s;ay&mdash;that is&mdash;I mean <HI>&s;en&s;ibility!&mdash;&s;oftne&s;s of &s;oul!</HI>&mdash;and <HI>all that!</HI>&mdash;You under&s;tand me."</P>
<P>"Madam!" &s;aid Barnwell, blu&s;hing deeply.</P>
<P>The lady reclining her head, and playing with her fan, continued, "I &s;ay&mdash;that is&mdash;it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay&mdash;but in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, when marria|ges are entered into without a con&s;ultation of that <HI>congeniality</HI> of <HI>&s;entiments;</HI> and people are thrown toge|ther, as it were, like blanks and prizes in a lottery: Why, it cannot be wondered at, that affection &s;hould not always follow, where parents or guardians&mdash;Heigho! Its exce&s;&s;ively warm," (fanning her&s;elf)&mdash;"Do, pray, throw that door open."</P>
<P>It was her chamber-door. Barnwell obeyed, and was retiring.</P>
<P>"Stay, Sir&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;Pray, Mr. Barnwell, can you conceive what can po&s;&s;ibly engage Mr. Emery &s;o perpetually from home?"</P>
<P>"No, Madam. I&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Not that I deem it a misfortune; he is &s;o moro&s;e in his manners of late&mdash;that, though I never did, to be &s;ure, love the man, yet one would contrive to keep up appearances. But really, of late, he has be|come &s;o indifferent, that one's lot is deplorable;&mdash;and&mdash;."</P>
<P>This lady of fa&s;hion now began to develope her intentions &s;o openly, that Barnwell, who&s;e &s;oul re|volted with di&s;gu&s;t at the di&s;covery, would certainly have betrayed that di&s;gu&s;t, but for a melancholy in|terruption, which di&s;clo&s;ed a pa&s;&s;ion of a purer na|ture. The love-&s;ick Maria had been permitted to &s;it up that afternoon, as the violence of her fever was abated, though &s;ucceeded by a melancholy of the mo&s;t painfully intere&s;ting nature.</P>
<P>She had expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to &s;ee Mrs. Emery, and her attendant accompanied her to the dre&s;&s;ing-room. Her eyes were fixed on the floor, as &s;he entered,
<PB N="249" REF="038596_0248_1012A0C78CC9A6B0">
leaning on the arm of her attendant. She did not perceive Barnwell&mdash;</P>
<P>"If you know he is very wicked, my dear Mrs. Emery," &s;aid &s;he, "you ought to tell me; for how &s;hould I have gue&s;&s;ed at &s;uch a thing&mdash;when his countenance was &s;o full of goodne&s;s?&mdash;What a de|ceiver he mu&s;t be! But don't you think he will grow tired of &s;uch bad ways?&mdash;Poor young man!&mdash;well, well&mdash;all is for the be&s;t!"</P>
<P>Mrs. Emery, bur&s;ting with anger and vexation at the interruption, was yet compelled to di&s;&s;emble.</P>
<P>Barnwell, he&s;itating whether to go or &s;tay, was pierced to the heart at the &s;ight of the lovely mourner. At the intimation of her nur&s;e, he concealed him&s;elf behind the door, as &s;he mu&s;t have &s;een him had he retired.</P>
<P>"My good girl," &s;aid Mrs. Emery, "why do you leave your room?"</P>
<P>"C," replied &s;he, "was &s;o unea&s;y, you can't think; for I can't help loving him:&mdash;and then, you know, the&s;e wicked women have &s;uch arts to en&s;nare poor youth! And if any harm were to happen to him&mdash;why, then&mdash;Mrs. Emery, my poor head aches &s;o very much, it makes me forget all that I was going to &s;ay. But, &s;uppo&s;e I was to talk to him&mdash;only for his own good!&mdash;He would li&s;ten to me.&mdash;I am very faint&mdash;and very ill&mdash;But he is well&mdash;that's a great happine&s;s to know he is well! I had &s;omething to a&s;k you, but my poor head grows quite forgetful&mdash;So let us go, Nur&s;e&mdash;and we will pray for him&mdash;come, we will pray for him!"</P>
<P>"Unfortunate girl!" exclaimed Mrs. Emery, when Maria had retired.</P>
<P>"I am lo&s;t in amazement!" interrupted Barn|well. "To what can the dear &s;ufferer allude?"</P>
<P>At that moment the trampling of hor&s;es in the court yard announced the arrival of Mr. Freeman, who was expected, in con&s;equence of the ill &s;tate of Mi&s;s Freeman's health.</P>
<P>Di&s;gu&s;ted at the conduct of Mrs. Emery, and at
<PB N="250" REF="038596_0249_10122B2C0E935E78">
the &s;ame moment filled with compa&s;&s;ion for the amiable Maria, Barnwell met the re&s;pectable and worthy Mr. Freeman.</P>
<P>"This, then is the end of my parting with her! Why did I tru&s;t the &s;taff of my old age from my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight? Shew me to my child!"</P>
<P>In vain Mrs. Emery and her daughters urged the impropriety, and even danger, of the interview. The fond, afflicted father was deaf to rea&s;on, and would &s;uffer no arguments to prevent him from embracing the object of all his love. Maria &s;hrieked at the &s;ight of him&mdash;ran to his arms, and buried her face in his bo&s;om. A fainting fit &s;ucceeded, in which, except for &s;hort intervals, &s;he remained the whole night. The venerable old man would not quit the bed-&s;ide, but per&s;onally admini&s;tered her medicines, and watch|ed her countenance with unwearied attention.</P>
<P>Another event, of the &s;ame evening, occa&s;ioned Barnwell fre&s;h food for conjecture, and &s;ome unea&s;i|ne&s;s. He had retired at the u&s;ual our, and upon entering the breakfa&s;t room, the next morning, was &s;urpri&s;ed to find it empty. In a few minutes his &s;ur|pri&s;e was increa&s;ed, by the entrance of Mr. Rigby, in a pair of red &s;lippers, his hair undre&s;&s;ed, and his whole appearance indicating that he had &s;lept in the hou&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;"There, my boy, as good as a prophet!" cried he, before Barnwell had recovered him&s;elf&mdash;"Knew it was upon the totter!&mdash;Saw it going&mdash;going&mdash;and now its <HI>gone!"</HI></P>
<P>"Sir!" &s;aid Barnwell.</P>
<P>"Tell you all about it. I was at Margate&mdash;charm|ing a&s;&s;embly&mdash;fine girls&mdash;&s;ix belles to a beau&mdash;gives one con&s;equence&mdash;didn't chu&s;e to dance&mdash;an hun|dred ogling me&mdash;kept up my dignity&mdash;&s;trutted about the rooms&mdash;lounged among the card folks&mdash;flattered the old dowagers, and made them throw away their aces."</P>
<P>"But what is all this?" &s;aid Barnwell.</P>
<P>"Coming to the point.&mdash;As I &s;tood leaning, in a
<PB N="251" REF="038596_0250_1012A0CC10C8C4A8">
pick tooth attitude, upon old Lady Snow-drop's chair, very attentive to a trick in diamonds, we were all frightened out of our wits by a &s;udden exclamation of "D&mdash;n!!&mdash;as loud as the echo of A&s;hley's double drums! I knew the voice&mdash;'Twas Emery's; every body was up, the cards were mixed, candles thrown down, and the whole room in complete con|&s;ternation!&mdash;The tremendous word, that occa&s;ion|ed; &s;uch an effect, was but the overture to the piece that &s;ucceeded; in which Emery, Middleton, a Cap|tain of the Guards, and the <HI>dear darling</HI> of an eminent di&s;tiller, were performers, both vocal and in&s;trument|al, their vociferations of abu&s;e being accompanied by the jarring of pokers, candle&s;ticks, and chairs!"</P>
<P>"Proceed, Sir," cried Barnwell: "if under all this embelli&s;hment there is any matter of fact&mdash;."</P>
<P>"O, <HI>excu&s;ez moi,</HI> my dear fellow&mdash;<HI>truth,</HI> to a word, on my honor, the antagoni&s;ts were at la&s;t parted; the cau&s;e of di&s;pute was <HI>blown&mdash;foul play</HI>&mdash;The di&s;tiller's &s;on had detected Middleton, at a time when &s;ome thou&s;ands were again&s;t the former. Emery was charged as an accomplice. Swords and pi&s;tols followed of cour&s;e, and an immediate meeting was agreed on. Emery &s;aw me, and entreated me to break the affair at home; and thus ends the fir&s;t part of the chapter of accidents.</P>
<P>"Are you in earne&s;t, Mr. Rigby?" &s;aid Barnwell: "really in earne&s;t; <HI>&s;erious</HI> I don't expect <HI>you</HI> to be."</P>
<P>"<HI>Real right earne&s;t,</HI> upon my honor."</P>
<P>"And where is Mr. Emery? Is he &s;afe?"</P>
<P>"<HI>Excu&s;ez moi</HI>&mdash;can't &s;ay&mdash;Drove to town like furies&mdash;Ju&s;tices had took the alarm, and would &s;uf|fer no meeting at Margate&mdash;'Twas quite a blaze&mdash;the whole town in an uproar."</P>
<P>"The event is uncertain, then?" cried Barnwell.</P>
<P>"Quite &s;o. A <HI>bit</HI> or a <HI>mi&s;s,</HI> that's the hazard."</P>
<P>"And Mrs. Emery and the ladies&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Have cried and fainted, and gone to &s;leep."</P>
<P>"Good God! what indifference about the life of a fellow-creature!" &s;aid Barnwell; and, bur&s;ting
<PB N="252" REF="038596_0251_1012A0D174BCF618">
in anger from Rigby, learned from the &s;ervants that the mo&s;t material part of his narrative was too true.&mdash;The ladies, in anxious expectation of tidings, remained in their room&mdash;whil&s;t Lord Morley and Mr. Ea&s;twood had gone po&s;t to London.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;crupulous care was taken to prevent a breath of this intelligence reaching the ears of Mr. Freeman, who &s;till kept watch by the bed-&s;ide of his daughter. All Ram&s;gate, however, rung with the &s;tory, coloured and improved by every retailer. Re|ports <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lew thick and fa&s;t&punc; The hou&s;e was be&s;et with inquirers; and Barnwell, fully occupied with at|tending Mrs. Emery and her daughters, and an&s;wer|ing the <HI>politely</HI> curious inqui&s;itors, found it would be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee Mental or Milwood that day, and therefore di&s;patched a note, announcing the event.</P>
<P>From the an&s;wer of Mental, he learned, that he had entered into a conver&s;ation with his daughter that morning, in which, as Mental expre&s;&s;ed it, "he had di&s;covered &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a vigorous mind, a quick fancy, and &s;ome acquired knowledge; but when I gazed on her countenance," continued he, "my memory ro&s;e in war again&s;t me; the image of her murdered mother &s;tood before me, and I was compelled to fly the vi&s;ion. I have &s;hut my&s;elf up in my chamber; I have rea&s;oned with the inward chid|ings of my &s;oul; I have &s;truggled to obtain acquittal of my&s;elf, and found that &s;truggle hard. When late I &s;tood upon the grave's brink, I was le&s;s &s;haken. I felt no pangs for an irretrievable act of homicide;&mdash;but the re&s;emblance grew upon me, fa&s;tened on my mind, and conjured up the thou&s;and vain regrets I thought for ever buried. Tho&s;e gloomy thoughts, which I oft indulged at the &s;till midnight hour in the old Abbey's ai&s;le, now be&s;et me, and attract the mind from more u&s;eful occupations.

<P>"From the window of my chamber, I &s;ee her at|tend a per&s;on, in a travelling dre&s;s, along the gravel walk to the wicket. Who is the Zelotti?&mdash;Come to me as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;Our &s;ituation becomes in|tere&s;ting. MENTAL."</P>
<P>Such was the conclu&s;ion of the letter Barnwell re|ceived from the Cottage.</P>
<P>Many hours of anxiety were endured by Barnwell ere any certain intelligence was received concerning Mr. Emery. About ten at night Lord Morley and Mr. Ea&s;twood returned.</P>
<P>Mr. Emery had received a very &s;evere wound in the head, and the ball was not extracted, at their de|parture from Portland Place. Captain Middleton had dangerou&s;ly wounded his antagoni&s;t, and had &s;et off immediately for Hamburgh.</P>
<P>To conceal the danger of Mr. Emery's &s;ituation from his family, it was &s;ettled that they &s;hould con|tinue for the pre&s;ent at Ram&s;gate, and be merely in|formed that a meeting had taken place, and Mr. Emery &s;lightly wounded, but forbid to travel for a day or two, when he would return to then.</P>
<P>About noon the following day a po&s;t-chai&s;e and &s;our drove into the court-yard, and Mr. Drudge, the acting partner in the concern of Freeman, Emery, and Co. was in a few &s;econds in the hall. Barnwell received him.&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;"Mr. Freeman!&mdash;Mr. Freeman!&mdash;Where's Mr. Freeman?&mdash;Let me &s;ee Mr. Freeman," ex|claimed Mr. Drudge.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="038596_0253_1012A0D5E308F2C8">
The rattling of the chai&s;e, the loud talking of Mr. Drudge, and the bu&s;tle of the &s;ervants, alarmed the whole family, who, with Mr. Freeman him&s;elf, were immediately a&s;&s;embled, to inquire the occa&s;ion of &s;uch a noi&s;e. Soon as Mr. Drudge &s;aw Mr. Free|man, he ran to him, and gra&s;ping his hand&mdash;</P>
<P>"O, Sir!&mdash;prepare your&s;elf&mdash;prepare your&s;elf.&mdash;&s;uch tidings!&mdash;&s;uch di&s;coveries!&mdash;Good God!"</P>
<P>Mr. Freeman trembled&mdash;Mrs. Emery and the la|dies almo&s;t fainted&mdash;whil&s;t Lord Morley and Mr. Ea&s;twood &s;tood motionle&s;s, with a &s;tupid &s;tare of vacancy.</P>
<P>"Is Mr. Emery dead?" exclaimed Barnwell.</P>
<P>"O, wor&s;e, wor&s;e than death&mdash;He is a&mdash;ruined man!&mdash;and much I fear his ruin will extend to more than him. O, my dear Sir, when I think what <HI>you</HI> mu&s;t feel!"&mdash;&s;till gra&s;ping Mr. Freeman's hand&mdash;.</P>
<P>"Ruin!&mdash;ruin!" exclaimed the worthy Mr. Free|man; and, placing his hand to his forehead, cried&mdash;"Strengthen me, good heaven!"</P>
<P>Lord Morley and Mr. Ea&s;twood gaped at each other, and the re&s;t of the company; and the latter, at length, propo&s;ed taking the ladies into another room, whil&s;t Mr. Drudge explained to Mr. Freeman. Barnwell remained.</P>
<P>"Where is Mr. Emery?" cried Mr. Freeman.</P>
<P>It now became nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint him with the affair at Margate; and Mr. Drudge added&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;"The report of &s;uch conduct &s;oon buzzed about London, and no le&s;s than ten arre&s;ts were that morning i&s;&s;ued again&s;t him; and notwith&s;tand|ing the poor man is ab&s;olutely delirious, from his wound, he has been removed to a &s;punging-hou&s;e. In the hou&s;e at Portland Place there are already four executions; as many in Broad Street, and at the Pa|vilion. Demands upon demands, to &s;uch amounts that a&s;toni&s;h me, flock &s;o fa&s;t one after another, that to procure bail is impo&s;&s;ible; and reparation &s;eems beyond the reach of human hands."</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="038596_0254_1012A0D8089E2958">
Such was Mr. Drudge's unvarni&s;hed tale; and its effect upon the mind of Mr. Freeman may be con|ceived, but cannot be expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"For <HI>this</HI> have I nouri&s;hed thee&mdash;thou Ingrate!" exclaimed Mr. Freeman,&mdash;"Villain!&mdash;hypocrite!&mdash;&s;miling, &s;y&s;tematic villain!!&mdash;What mu&s;t be done? You, too hone&s;t man, the &s;weat of who&s;e brows have furni&s;hed this mon&s;ter with luxuries&mdash;you, too, mu&s;t be involved in his ruin!"</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure I mu&s;t &s;uffer&mdash;my wife and children mu&s;t &s;uffer!" &s;aid Mr. Drudge. "But, O, Sir, <HI>I</HI> am a young man yet; but <HI>you,</HI> you Sir&mdash;who have grown old in the re&s;pect of the world, and have ac|quired a right to the comforts of age&mdash;<HI>you,</HI> Sir, mu&s;t be a &s;ufferer, indeed!&mdash;Your amiable daughter too&mdash;."</P>
<P>"Hold, hold, hold!" cried Freeman: <HI>"there</HI> you touch my &s;oul! But how can he &s;o long have deceiv|ed us both?"</P>
<P>"Alas! Sir, <HI>I</HI> have long &s;u&s;pected when balance after balance has been again&s;t us; but he was &s;o ready with &s;pecious excu&s;es.

<P><HI>"My</HI> &s;anction!&mdash;I never dreamt of &s;uch proceed|ings. Month after month he remitted to me &s;tate|ments of the concerns, that &s;hewed an <HI>increa&s;ing,</HI> very increa&s;ing balance in our favor."</P>
<P>"Good God, what villainy!&mdash;Sir, he has repeat|edly, again and again, a&s;&s;ured me you knew the facts, and approved them; while, at the &s;ame moment, he mu&s;t have been remitting for your in&s;pection, &s;tate|ments of his own fabrication."</P>
<P>"Can human nature be &s;o ba&s;e!" &s;aid Mr. Free|man. "But what can be done? How are we to learn the amount of debts again&s;t us?"</P>
<P>"A meeting mu&s;t be in&s;tantly called," &s;aid Mr. Drudge.</P>

<P>Barnwell, who trembled for the effects of this <HI>&s;toppage</HI> upon his own crime, was &s;carcely able to &s;peak; yet the tears of &s;uch a man as Mr. Freeman rou&s;ed him to attempt &s;omething like con&s;olation.</P>

<P>A SCENE of confu&s;ion followed the abrupt de|parture of Barnwell. Nothing but madne&s;s could be devi&s;ed as the cau&s;e of &s;uch a proceeding.

<P>From the tenor of your note to Mr. Emery, it is evident you are unacquainted with late events that have taken place in that per&s;on's fa|mily. Mr. Emery has been proved a mo&s;t unprin|cipled game&s;ter; and, in con&s;equence of &s;ome un|fair tran&s;action, has been called out, and &s;everely wounded.

Mr. Freeman, and the other per&s;on con|cerned, are al&s;o ruined, in the full &s;en&s;e of the word. Your nephew, overcome by the&s;e events, or &s;ome other cau&s;e, has become deranged. He left the hou&s;e in a fit of in&s;anity this morning, and has not &s;ince been heard of. It is truly afflicting to a delicate mind to relate &s;uch events; but as Mrs. Emery is unfit for &s;uch a ta&s;k, it has devolved upon,</P>

"Lord Morley, and the Rev. Mr. Ea&s;twood, mo&s;t cruelly tortured at the events which have taken place in Mr. Emery's family, would merit the &s;evere&s;t cen|&s;ure, if, by their pre&s;ence, they continued to remind the unfortunate of their former &s;ituation in life. They are &s;en&s;ible, therefore, that they are con&s;ulting Mrs. and the Mi&s;s Emery's tenderne&s;s of feeling, when they re&s;olve to &s;ave them the pain of a farewell, under their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances.

<P><HI>"Mrs. Emery."</HI></P>
<P>Thus fled the&s;e <HI>&s;ummer friends,</HI> at the fir&s;t bla&s;t of wintery adver&s;ity. How different the conduct of the worthy Sir James Barnwell! Soon as he had peru&s;ed Mr. Ea&s;twood's note, he repaired to the hou&s;e of mourning; nor did the heart-felt &s;orrow which &s;eiz|ed him on his nephew's account, prevent him from tendering every con&s;olation in his power to the unfor|tunate Emery's.</P>
<P>The&s;e ladies felt the change of circum&s;tances &s;e|verely indeed. Mother and daughters &s;o re&s;embled each other in their feelings, that one de&s;cription &s;erves each and all. Uneducated in any true principles of religion or morality, they had borne pro&s;perity too ill to &s;u&s;tain adver&s;ity with fortitude. When they were &s;urrounded by the luxuries and dainties of life, and &s;eemed placed on an eminence above the reach of want, or woe, they had never been taught to reflect upon the means, by which they were thus exalted, whil&s;t millions of their fellow-creatures <HI>&s;truggled</HI> to endure exi&s;tence: they never reflected, it was that chance "in the affairs of men" which gave <HI>them</HI> wealth, and <HI>others</HI> want; but vainly arrogating to them&s;elves a vi&s;ionary &s;uperiority in the &s;cale of hu|man beings, called not the poor their brethren. In|&s;tead,
<PB N="261" REF="038596_0260_10122DE60B00F0B8">
therefore, of alleviating the con&s;equences of that inequality in &s;ociety (which experience &s;eems to pronounce inevitable) the occupation of their lives was to increa&s;e that &s;plendor, which dazzled&mdash;but never cheered the poor! The feelings of benevo|lence, the impul&s;e of charity, the glow of &s;en&s;ibility, are words they may have heard, but emotions they had never felt. How pitiable, then, their pre&s;ent &s;ituation. In an in&s;tant that pinnacle, on which they were exalted, &s;inks; and from affluence to poverty is but the journey of an hour. The &s;entiments they had imbibed continue; and, judging from their own feelings, they con&s;ider them&s;elves, of cour&s;e, objects of contempt to the rich; whil&s;t, at the &s;ame time, fallen pride is naturally the ridicule of the poor.</P>
<P>The benevolent Knight in vain offered con&s;olation to minds the victims of childi&s;h fretfulne&s;s:&mdash;&s;obs, tears, and fits &s;ucceeding fits, prevented the voice of rea&s;on from approaching their ears. Turning, there|fore, from &s;o vain an effort, he rendered them, un|known to them&s;elves, a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The proprietor of the ready furni&s;hed hou&s;e they occupied, had expre&s;&s;ed, in his hearing, his wi&s;h they &s;hould quit his premi&s;es, as he &s;aw no chance of ever being paid. Sir James became re&s;pon&s;ible, and the landlord became quiet.&mdash;Meanwhile, he had not neglected any &s;teps immediately nece&s;&s;ary for the di&s;|covery of his nephew. Hand-bills were printed, and brought home, de&s;cribing his per&s;on and dre&s;s, and were about to be circulated, when a fi&s;herman brought a letter, 'which,' he &s;aid, 'a &s;trange young gentleman wrote, at a public hou&s;e in Sandwich, where he was, and gave him a crown to bring it to this hou&s;e.' It bore this direction&mdash;'Let any per|&s;on, except the &s;ervants, open it.&mdash;G. B.'</P>
<P>Sir James broke the &s;eal, and read as follows:&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"George Barnwell entreats mo&s;t earne&s;tly, that his abrupt departure, and his ab&s;ence, may be mo&s;t &s;crupulou&s;ly concealed from the knowledge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his mother, his &s;i&s;ter, and his uncle. Whoever is offici|ous

</LETTER>
<P>Whil&s;t Sir James held this note in his hand, and ju&s;t as he wiped a tear from his eyes, entered Mr. Sandall. He had heard the &s;tate of Mr. Emery's af|fairs, and accordingly followed his patron to enjoy the whole, true, and full account, as a mo&s;t ample meal of &s;candal, upon which poi&s;onous food he loved to gormandize.</P>
<P>Ob&s;equiou&s;ly cringing, as he held the door in his hand&mdash;"I fear, Sir James, I intrude&mdash;I&mdash;."</P>
<P>"O, Mr. Sandall," cried the knight, "my poor nephew&mdash;Read&mdash;read!"</P>
<P>"Alas, alas!" &s;aid Sandall, when he had peru&s;ed it. "Ay, this is always the end of &s;uch fiery, un|controulable youths. I was afraid what would be his conduct, ever &s;ince he &s;o ob&s;tinately re&s;i&s;ted our ar|guments upon apparitions;&mdash;there was too much en|quiring, doubting, here&s;y, about that youth; and then, his connecting him&s;elf with that impious, athe|i&s;tical Illuminati, Mental; for I have proofs that he is one; or el&s;e what could be the meaning of his my&s;tic coffin lid, and his &s;kull, and his nightly orgies in the abbey?"</P>
<P>"Silence&mdash;&s;ilence," cried Sir James. "You judge too quickly to judge impartially. May it not prove that &s;ome youthful indi&s;cretions have brought on embarra&s;&s;ments, of which he is a&s;hamed?&mdash;But what can he mean by a day or two's concealment? So <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> to leave the hou&s;e, too&mdash;It is all extra|ordinary!"</P>
<P>"It <HI>is</HI> extraordinary," &s;aid Sandall, who never dif|fered many moments from his patron's opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="038596_0262_10122E1F68FB7C50">
"To acquaint his mother with the affair at pre&s;ent, would be cruel."</P>
<P>"It <HI>would</HI> be cruel, cried Sandall.</P>
<P>"And would an&s;wer no end," &s;aid Sir James.</P>
<P>"No end at all," rejoined Sandall.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of their deliberations was, to continue their &s;earch and inquiries after the poor fugitive, and at lea&s;t, for a day or two, to keep his mother and &s;i&s;ter ignorant of the event.</P>

<P>WHILE &s;uch was the &s;tate of affairs at Emery's, the following letter, from Milwood to Zelotti, will unfold the &s;cenes pa&s;&s;ing at the cottage. It was writ|ten the evening of the day on which Barnwell fled.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Zelotti,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Ha&s;ten, ha&s;ten on the wings of mighty Mi&s;chief!&mdash;Events are rapidly &s;ucceeding each other, of high and intere&s;ting import. There are materials now ready to our hands, Zelotti, of which thy matchle&s;s talents might frame fabrics of fe|licity for thy Milwood, that will exi&s;t with her exi&s;t|ence. In plain terms, there is wealth ready to be ga|thered, that &s;hall furni&s;h all the goods of exi&s;tence, all the plea&s;ures, enjoyments, and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s of living, as long as I &s;hall live.</P>
<P>This will meet you, I hope, near my pre&s;ent humble cottage. I intend it merely as a plan of the camp you are entering. The &s;tranger is rich, I am convinced beyond all doubt. There lie in a chair, by his bed-&s;ide, two packets, &s;ealed; only part of their
<PB N="264" REF="038596_0263_10122E4F9F5DB960">
contents were, therefore, vi&s;ible to the prying eye. I could di&s;cover enough, however, to know that Barn|well is the &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of his wealth after his de|cea&s;e; and the words "e&s;tates in Hertford&s;hire, jew|els, ca&s;h, &amp;c." I could catch half glimp&s;es of. On the &s;ame chair is a ca&s;ket, doubtle&s;s the repo&s;itory of the&s;e jewels. My hand is eager for the blow, Zelotti!</P>
<P>From old Townly, let me lead you to another character.&mdash;Emery has thrown his die, and lo&s;t!&mdash;We ever, you know, concluded that would be the ca&s;e. Half villains and half wits never thrive in this planet of the &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;Perhaps they may do better, &s;hould they hereafter tenant the <HI>moon!</HI> Middleton too, rejoice with me, my friend, Middleton, is com|pelled to fly the kingdom, whil&s;t Emery, whom he has long made his &s;taff of life, is reduced to beggary. This is all well&mdash;this is a mo&s;t delicious draught for the thir&s;t of proud revenge! But it &s;hall not in|toxicate the &s;ober Milwood. No, Zelotti;&mdash;'twere but a puny gratification for a mind like mine, did it end here; but mark the con&s;equences:&mdash;The forged acceptance of five hundred pounds, on which our tool Blackmore advanced me three, you recollect he was to re&s;erve in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till nearly due; but the needy rogue broke his promi&s;e, and di&s;coun|ted it to &s;ome Jew, or, in other words, &s;old it for three hundred and eighty.&mdash;This bill naturally enough, was &s;u&s;pected, and Blackmore was acquainted of the circum&s;tance. This di&s;covery, and the dread of &s;ome others, gave wings to the man of law, and by this time he is on his voyage to America. The boy Barn|well, terrified beyond all mea&s;ure at this di&s;covery, fled from his friends, like a lunatic, the moment he heard it; and having rambled the whole of this day without food, by &s;ecret paths, and under cover of the night, arrived here about an hour ago. Of all the compo&s;itions of human nature, that I have hither|to &s;tudied, he is by far the neare&s;t to that &s;tandard, which is called good in &s;ociety: of cour&s;e the be&s;t
<PB N="265" REF="038596_0264_10122EF76BB06320">
adapted to our purpo&s;e; for, do we not know, Ze|lotti, that the wicked are wary? Had Barnwell brought with him, to Berners Street, polluted pa&s;&s;ions, would he &s;o ea&s;ily have fallen our victim?&mdash;Had Barnwell been in the habit of di&s;&s;embling, would he have &s;crupled to have told &s;ome varni&s;hed tale to Emery, as an excu&s;e for borrowing three hundred pounds? Or, had his heart been ca&s;ed in adamant, as Middle|ton's, as our's, as half mankind's are, would he have committed him&s;elf to the ri&s;k of death to have pre|&s;erved another's life? O, never!&mdash;But, no matter by what means we have en&s;nared him; he is now as completely in my power as my heart can wi&s;h. I am not altogether &s;orry you are not here, till I have di&s;po&s;ed of him. He is concealed in the chamber which mu&s;t be your's.&mdash;Mo&s;t fortunately for us, he refu&s;es to &s;ee old Townley, and begs earne&s;tly that he may not be acquainted with his arrival.</P>
<P>Nor is this all:&mdash;as if chance it&s;elf had e&s;pou&s;ed our cau&s;e, it has directed, ju&s;t at this momentous cri&s;is, Barnwell's uncle to Ram&s;gate, who has taken up his re&s;idence at the hou&s;e where Emery re&s;ided. This event has filled me with ambitious, bold de&s;ires!</P>
<P>What think you, Zelotti; is it not po&s;&s;ible to combine our &s;chemes, and by a <HI>double</HI> blow accom|pli&s;h the di&s;mi&s;&s;al of Townley and old Barnwell both? 'Twould be a glorious atchievement, and its re&s;ult would be a con&s;onant reward.&mdash;Hu&s;h! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 'Twas Barnwell &s;tealing from his chamber; he tapped at my door, and I had ju&s;t &s;uf|ficient time to conceal my letter, when he entered, more like a &s;pectre than a man&mdash;his hair di&s;hevelled, his eyes red with weeping, his cheeks and lips pale as Con&s;umption. Speechle&s;s, he tottered towards my chair, and &s;eated him&s;elf on the floor at my feet, reclining his head on my lap.</P>
<P>As old Townley &s;leeps in the room above, I dared not &s;uffer him to &s;peak&mdash;I forced him to &s;wal|low a cordial, and have prevailed on him to throw him&s;elf upon the bed. He &s;lumbers; but his mind,
<PB N="266" REF="038596_0265_10122F43FA54C128">
even in &s;leep, is haunted. At intervals he pronoun|ces "Milwood' &s;o loudly, that if old Townley 'wakes, he mu&s;t &s;urely hear it. At other times he calls upon his mother, his Eliza, and has this moment uttered, in a voice of agony, "Father, father!&mdash;&s;ave me, &s;ave me!"&mdash;</P>
<P>If the&s;e powerful effects follow the dread of a detection of forgery, a common rea&s;oner would &s;ay, there is but poor hope that we &s;hall compel him to murder. That very dread, however, is the ba&s;is of my hope&mdash;I'll keep him the whole of to-morrow in my own room, &s;o that the chamber is ready for your reception.&mdash;The light of to-morrow's &s;un will &s;hew me my Zelotti. Remember your part, and I will devote the whole of this night to the &s;tudy of mine.</P>

<P>Whil&s;t, with a fiend-like indu&s;try, Milwood thus &s;pread new toils for the un&s;u&s;pecting victim of her infernal machinations, he, in broken &s;lumbers, folt all the horrors of his &s;ituation; and when the light of morning di&s;pelled his dreams, the reality of his fate was to his exqui&s;itely feeling heart, intolerable.</P>
<P>In the meanwhile Mental pa&s;&s;ed his hours mo&s;t unplea&s;antly. His &s;ituation became torture. He was placed under the &s;ame roof with his own, his only child; but every opportunity of conver&s;e which he &s;natched, all the ob&s;ervations he could form, tended to confirm him more and more in the opinion, that this child was lo&s;t to virtue for ever! De&s;pairing, therefore, for the &s;ucce&s;s of any attempts towards her reformation, he that morning re&s;olved to remove from the cottage, without making him&s;elf known.</P>
<P>Ignorant of tho&s;e important events which had ta|ken place at Mr. Emery's, he began to murmur at the ab&s;ence of Barnwell, and hinted his intention of inquiring for him at Mr. Emery's, if he did not call in the cour&s;e of that morning. This &s;tep Milwood

determined to prevent.&mdash;About noon Zelotti arri|ved. Mental was in the parlour when he entered, and Milwood introduced them to each other.</P>
<P>The per&s;on and manners of this Italian were ex|tremely prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, and in a very few minutes he found means to entangle Mental in a conver&s;ation, in &s;pite of the general taciturnity of the latter. Men|tal was, perhaps, in &s;ome degree, induced to this con|ver&s;ation by the curio&s;ity he felt concerning Zelotti; but the Italian was too wary to allow the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible clue to his real character to e&s;cape him. Mental perceived, however, that Zelotti was no common man.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t employment of Zelotti, after a con&s;ul|tation with Milwood, was to a&s;&s;ume the di&s;gui&s;e of a fi&s;herman, and <HI>reconnoitre</HI> Mr. Emery's late re&s;idence. He was admitted to the pre&s;ence of the almo&s;t di&s;|tracted uncle of Barnwell. His olive complexion helped his di&s;gui&s;e, and he &s;poke Engli&s;h very well.</P>
<P>"I believe I am right," &s;aid the impo&s;tor; "you are the ma&s;ter, as I take it, of one George Barnwell.'</P>
<P>"No, no," cried Sir James, "I am his uncle: Where is he?&mdash;Where is my nephew?'</P>
<P>"That is more than I mu&s;t tell."</P>
<P>"But you &s;hall be compelled to tell."</P>
<P>"No, Sir; I am poor, and roughly fini&s;hed; but I have never yet, nor I never will, betray my tru&s;t."</P>
<P>"But 'tis for his intere&s;t, 'tis for his happine&s;s alone, I wi&s;h to know. Take me, then, to the poor di&s;|tracted youth, and he him&s;elf will ble&s;s you for it to the late&s;t hour of his life."</P>
<P>"It mu&s;t not be&mdash;I have &s;worn an oath, your honour, a &s;acred, &s;olemn oath, that I would not utter a word that might lead to his di&s;covery."</P>
<P>"What is the purpo&s;e of your errand, then?"</P>
<P>"This, your honour&mdash;to &s;ay, that he will either come home to night, or el&s;e that he will write a let|ter; but being much afraid his ab&s;ence might be blazed abroad, he wanted much to be a&s;&s;ured that his mother nor his uncle were apprized of it."</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="038596_0267_10122DDFF2262E38">
"His mother and &s;i&s;ter are yet ignorant of it; and if he would return immediately, they might never know it. I have letters to deliver from them; but being ignorant of their contents, I know not how they might affect him."</P>
<P>"I'll an&s;wer for it, they will be the means of ha&s;tening his return; be&s;ides, your honour, if you were to &s;end them, and &s;ome kind me&s;&s;age from your&s;elf, I'd back it to the be&s;t of my power. Whil&s;t he is at my hut no harm &s;hall come to him; and either I, or Margery, my dame, have always our eyes upon him. When he leaves us I'll &s;ee, too, that he goes no where but to this hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"Will you promi&s;e to do this&mdash;will you, on your oath, promi&s;e to do this?" &s;aid the knight.&mdash;"And do you really think he will come to-night?"</P>
<P>"I do, I do," cried Zelotti.</P>
<P>"Then, here, hone&s;t fellow, take him th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e two letters from his mother and &s;i&s;ter, and tell him, that if all I po&s;&s;e&s;s can render him happy, it is his own.

<P>"Put up your pur&s;e, your honour," cried Zelotti; "the plea&s;ure of carrying &s;uch a kind me&s;&s;age to heal his poor broken heart, is reward enough to Ned Martin."</P>
<P>He retired.&mdash;Sir James's heart was lightened con&s;iderably by the hope which this impo&s;tor occa|&s;ioned, and he wrote to his &s;i&s;ter-in-law, and his niece, to appri&s;e them of the change in his old friend Mr. Freeman's affairs, and &s;lightly mentioned that his nephew was well; but much employed in con&s;equence of the unfortunate alteration in the circum&s;tances of his friends.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>UPON the return of Zelotti, conference was held betwixt that &s;ubtle Italian and Milwood, the re&s;ult of which was the following conduct:&mdash;</P>
<P>Barnwell had made her chamber his pri&s;on. It was nearly dark when Milwood, confu&s;ion and di&s;|may pictured in her countenance, ru&s;hed into the apartment, and locked the door.</P>
<P>"Barnwell!" exclaimed &s;he, "Barnwell! arou&s;e your&s;elf, or we are lo&s;t for ever!"</P>
<P>The unhappy Barnwell, almo&s;t &s;tupified with &s;or|row, &s;at on a chair, his legs placed on a window-&s;eat, reclining his head on his hand, like one inani|mate.&mdash;He noticed nothing that &s;he &s;aid. She ap|proached him, took his hand in her's, and gazed full in his face.&mdash;</P>
<P>"O, Milwood! that face&mdash;tho&s;e eyes&mdash;were they de&s;igned by nature to accompli&s;h &s;uch wide ruin? Poor Eliza! poor mother!"</P>
<P>There was &s;uch a &s;ettled wildne&s;s in his eyes, that Milwood doubted, for a moment, whether he was &s;en&s;ible. After &s;ome time, a deep &s;igh was followed by a flood of tears, which &s;eemed greatly to relieve him.</P>
<P>"Come, come; for &s;hame," &s;aid &s;he," conquer the&s;e unmanly vapours; &s;ummon the energy of your mind; it is now, Barnwell, you need it. This weak, puerile dejection, is ruinous and di&s;graceful. Arou&s;e, Barnwell, arou&s;e!&mdash;think what you owe to the law of nature&mdash;your own defence&mdash;think what you owe the dignity of your nature, and &s;corn to crawl thus, on captive knees, beneath the iron &s;cep|tre of imperious fate. Such ba&s;e yielding ill becomes

the man of mind, of &s;overeignty of &s;oul&mdash;it ill be|comes my Barnwell. Arm your&s;elf, then, with the intrepidity of manhood, and &s;truggle to the la&s;t ga&s;p with fate, till death or triumph end the &s;trife."</P>
<P>"Alas! what is there more to be atchieved? Do not the &s;wift feet of Ju&s;tice hunt me? Does not her out&s;tretched arm hold over my devoted head the &s;word of death? What have I, then, to do, but to &s;ub|mit?"</P>
<P>"Cowardly, grovelling notion! Why, a poor rep|tile outca&s;t of &s;ociety, a being ri&s;ing &s;carcely any thing in intellect above the worm we tread on, a petty common thief, trembling beneath the &s;hadow of his gibbet, could not concede a meaner, more humilia|ting confe&s;&s;ion. And &s;hall Barnwell &s;neak thus like a reptile to his hole, and die? O, whither are thy feelings fled? Where are the powers of thy memory? What, tamely yield your&s;elf to a felon's fate&mdash;chains, public infamy, and public death? Look at the effects of &s;uch conduct on others&mdash;Behold the pale, death|like form that gave you life&mdash;gaze on her agonies&mdash;&s;ee how &s;he rends her grey hairs&mdash;how &s;he mangles tho&s;e brea&s;ts that have nurtured thee! See, too, a beauteous &s;i&s;ter falling, in the bloom of life, a victim to thy di&s;graceful fate!&mdash;while I&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Hold, Milwood, as you value my exi&s;tence!&mdash;If thus you paint the horrors that await me, no &s;trength of rea&s;on, no &s;ugge&s;tions of moral duty, will prevent me from in&s;tant &s;uicide. Surely I was born for the accur&s;ed purpo&s;e of inflicting tortures on tho&s;e I love!&mdash;But &s;pare me the painful picture. In my heart, in my brain, the impre&s;&s;ion of all the&s;e horrors is fixed with unutterable angui&s;h!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"You feel all the&s;e horrors, you &s;ay; yet who can believe it? You make no &s;ingle effort to avert them&mdash;In&s;en&s;ible to the dangers that threaten us, tamely you indulge a fruitle&s;s &s;orrow."</P>
<P>"Is it not <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> to e&s;cape tho&s;e dangers?"</P>
<P>"It is po&s;&s;ible not to endure them."</P>

<P>"Ay, even to Milwood&mdash;but what then?

[At the&s;e words &s;he ex|po&s;ed the handle of the dagger which &s;he con&s;tantly wore in her bo&s;om.]</P>
<P>"Milwood, you dare not meditate &s;uch mi&s;chief!" &s;aid Barnwell, &s;eizing her hand. "O, here, in this brea&s;t, rather plunge the weapon! Why &s;hould you bleed for my crimes&mdash;why&mdash;O, my brain burns&mdash;I am giddy with madne&s;s of thought!"</P>
<P>"Of what does Barnwell think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> nature of his Milwood is compounded? Surely he mu&s;t think fear of death is an ingredient in her compo&s;ition, if he &s;uppo&s;es &s;he can undergo, with coward patience, the &s;olemn mockeries of funereal preparations, a&s;cend a &s;caffold, face a multitude, and bear the tortures of &s;uper&s;titious rites and ceremonies, merely for a <HI>little</HI> longer life. No, &s;ince we mu&s;t die, let us, like Ro|mans, meet the blow, rather than wait the lingering &s;troke of <HI>&s;y&s;tematic</HI> murder."</P>
<P>"You &s;peak as if we were already apprehended, and even &s;entenced."</P>
<P>"And is it not &s;o? Do you imagine that, in our pre&s;ent condition, there is a po&s;&s;ibility of our e&s;cape? Have I&mdash;have you&mdash;ten pounds in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?

Barnwell &s;huddered with horror; his whole ma&s;s of blood &s;eemed, in a moment, congealed; the cold|ne&s;s of death &s;eized his limbs, and the features of his face were worked up to phren&s;y.</P>
<P>"Thou a woman?" exclaimed he, "a woman! No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;thou art &s;ome &s;pirit of the grand ene|my of mankind, permitted to a&s;&s;ume this lovely form, to bla&s;t the peace of families, to &s;ever the hearts of mother, &s;i&s;ter, &s;on and brother, from each other; to drain the human heart of its own natural affections, and in their place implant a poi&s;onous lu&s;t, that gene|rates a chilling apathy to all but thine accur&s;ed &s;elf: that wars with all that is good and amiable in &s;ociety, that &s;tirs rebellion again&s;t God him&s;elf, prompts the de&s;pairing &s;oul to the la&s;t damning act of &s;in, and bears it, with a horrid yell of triumph, to &s;cenes of endle&s;s torture and de&s;pair!"</P>
<P>In the extreme of agony, the lo&s;t youth tore his hair, threw him&s;elf upon the floor, and abandoned him&s;elf to the violence of his de&s;pair!</P>
<P>Milwood, with the malice and art of a daemon, &s;ilently contemplated the progre&s;s of her operations. She &s;uffered him to exhau&s;t the violence of his feel|ings, and &s;at covering her face with her handkerchief. After &s;ome time, Barnwell, rai&s;ing his eyes from the floor, beheld her in tears.</P>
<P>What is that potent, mo&s;t my&s;terious influence, to which is given the name of Love? Say, ye, who aim at defining all the influences and operations of our nature, who pre&s;ume to have di&s;covered cau&s;es for all the actions of men&mdash;how is it, that a being, en|dowed with more than the common powers of rea&s;on, who&s;e heart has been fenced with the le&s;&s;ons of vir|tue, &s;hould, by the influence of this mo&s;t powerful pa&s;&s;ion, be impelled to the commi&s;&s;ion of deeds, at which, when that influence cea&s;es to operate, his heart recoils with horror, and his rea&s;on &s;urveys with a&s;toni&s;hment?</P>
<P>Barnwell &s;aw her tears; they were like burning drops upon his own heart&mdash;he aro&s;e&mdash;he flew to the di&s;&s;embler.</P>

"Milwood, Milwood! you weep&mdash;you are wretch|ed&mdash;and I have made you &s;o!"</P>
<P>"You have, indeed," &s;aid &s;he. O, unkind&mdash;O, cruel! But I de&s;erve it&mdash;yes, I de&s;erve it, Barnwell; but could I have imagined <HI>you,</HI> of all men, would thus heap reproaches upon the poor heart o'er which you have triumphed!

<P>She wept, and her whole &s;oul &s;eemed melted into woe. Barnwell, irre&s;olute and wavering in his mind, was at a lo&s;s in what language to addre&s;s her. She continued&mdash;</P>
<P>"If our fates have proved calamitous; if evil, fol|lowing on the heels of evil, pur&s;ues us, how am I to blame? Did <HI>I</HI> reque&s;t that &s;econd fatal interview, the &s;ource of all our woes? Was I not prepared to leave forever the i&s;le which you inhabited?

Why have I offered the antidote of death to the mi&s;e|ries that threaten?&mdash;becau&s;e I knew you timid, &s;cru|pulou&s;ly he&s;itating; when the only means of e&s;caping them are bold, enterpri&s;ing, and uncommon; &s;uch as, indeed, are above the u&s;e of beings educated in the prejudices and errors of &s;y&s;tems; &s;uch as I know you could never be brought to u&s;e; and, therefore, we mu&s;t die!"</P>
<P>"Die!" exclaimed Barnwell; "you&mdash;you mu&s;t die? O, God, forbid!&mdash;Let us fly&mdash;let us fly this in&s;tant, Milwood! I begin to &s;ee your horrible con|dition" (putting his hand to his forehead.) "Mer|ciful Heaven!&mdash;Milwood, why did <HI>you</HI> concern your|&s;elf in the accur&s;ed forgery?&mdash;O, forgive my mad|ne&s;s, when I accu&s;ed you.

<P>"Alas! my Barnwell," cried Milwood, prepared for this propo&s;al, "hope nothing there. He left the cottage this morning early, as he &s;aid, on urgent bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and will not return till to-morrow: by that period our fate will be decided."</P>
<P>"<HI>Our</HI> fate, Milwood! No, no, <HI>you</HI> mu&s;t not &s;uffer. On me&mdash;on me, ju&s;t Heaven, pour thy vengeance! But has not my friend left his ca&s;ket?&mdash;I know its value&mdash;I know your right to it."</P>
<P>"You talk wildly, my Barnwell! But even had we the right you &s;peak of, we have not the power; the ca&s;ket is not here.'</P>
<P>"Did he not &s;ay whither he was gone?"</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"Did he ever conver&s;e with you on any &s;ubjects be&s;ides common ones? Did he ever make any di&s;cov|ery, or throw out any hints?"</P>
<P>"No&mdash;no&mdash;none&mdash;but let us not wa&s;te time now inwords, when every moment that e&s;capes us brings the cri&s;is of our &s;ate &s;till nearer."</P>
<P>"You are calm, Milwood!&mdash;Ah! then, I know your re&s;olution&mdash;Give me that dagger."</P>
<P>"No, Barnwell; 'tis the la&s;t wreck of hope that's left to cling to."</P>
<P>The di&s;tracted youth now raved again&mdash;all the en|dearments of the &s;iren, all the high-wrought pictur|ings of memory, bur&s;t at once on his imagination. She was every thing to him, in this moment of tran&s;|portation from him&s;elf.

<P>He &s;truck his head violently.&mdash;She &s;uffered him to remain &s;ilent a few minutes, and then, in a mo&s;t tender voice&mdash;</P>
<P>"Barnwell, &s;peak to me&mdash;tell me&mdash;am I to die?"</P>
<P>He threw him&s;elf into her arms.</P>
<P>"Live, Milwood, live!&mdash;though perdition, ever|la&s;ting perdition, be the price of your exi&s;tence!"</P>
<P>From this moment he was lo&s;t. The &s;ituation of his uncle at Mr. Emery's was made known to him; &s;he pur&s;uaded him that the forged bill had pa&s;&s;ed in|to his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; that, ignorant who had forged it, he &s;till held it; and, if he lived, mu&s;t, in &s;pite of every wi&s;h to the contrary, be compelled to appear again&s;t them.</P>

<BIBL>TRAGEDY OF PHILASTER.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SIR James Barnwell had ju&s;t fini&s;hed a &s;olitary &s;upper, when Barnwell, attended by Zelotti, rung the bell at the gate of the court yard. The pride of Mrs. Emery and her daughter, confined them to their chambers; the poor Maria was entru&s;ted to the care of a nur&s;e; and Mr. Sandall was gone to vi&s;it a friend at Margate.</P>
<P>The pretended fi&s;herman introduced Barnwell to his rejoicing uncle, who fell on his neck, and embra|ced him. Barnwell, pale and trembling, &s;eated him|&s;elf &s;ilently on a chair, and &s;upported his head by lean|ing

his elbow on the table. Zelotti, in a whi&s;per to Sir James, ob&s;erved, that the le&s;s notice was taken of him, and the earlier they retired, the better, and then departed. The angui&s;h of the old man, as he looked upon his nephew, was keen indeed.</P>
<P>"You look ill, my nephew; you are fatigued. We will not enter on the cau&s;e of your unea&s;ine&s;s to|night; but if your happine&s;s can be re&s;tored by any means in my power, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf of my be&s;t en|deavors."</P>
<P>"You are very good&mdash;yes, you are <HI>truly</HI> good&mdash;and that's one comfortable reflection," &s;aid Barnwell.</P>
<P>Sir James little &s;u&s;pected the drift of his di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>"Have you &s;upped, George?"</P>
<P>"I have not eat, a long while, Sir; my appetite is gone, quite gone&mdash;but I can drink&mdash;what have you there, wine?"</P>
<P>The wine was on the table; he drank a bumper greedily.</P>
<P>"You don't inquire after your mother, or your &s;i&s;ter, George."</P>
<P>"O, true! you're right&mdash;my mother&mdash;ah, my mother&mdash;and Eliza&mdash;poor girl!&mdash;Come, Sir, won't you take &s;ome wine?"</P>
<P>Sir James was alarmed at his wild manner. Barn|well poured out another bumper, and &s;wallowed it.</P>
<P>"How much does it want to one o'clock?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"'Tis not twelve," &s;aid Sir James.</P>
<P>At that in&s;tant Mr. Sandall entered the room. Sir James intimated &s;ilence to him. Barnwell look|ed at him, but did not notice him.</P>
<P>"What an altered hou&s;e is this!" &s;aid Barnwell. "No more merriment!&mdash;Well, I mu&s;t to bed&mdash;and you, Mr. Sandall, being a divine, will pray for us all&mdash;Uncle, do you pray every night?"</P>
<P>Sir James, who conceived his brain injured, hu|moured him, and an&s;wered him&mdash;"Always, George."</P>
<P>"I am glad of that," &s;aid he; "you are a righte|ous man, and your prayers are heard."</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="038596_0278_10122F5F584DD8F8">
He rung for the &s;ervant. At the door he turned round and &s;tood with his eyes fixed &s;ome time on his uncle, then retired, &s;aying, as he left the room, "God ble&s;s you, Sir&mdash;good night."</P>
<P>When the man had attended him to his chamber door, which was one, among &s;everal, in a long gal|lery&mdash;"There poor Mi&s;s Freeman &s;leeps&mdash;does &s;he not, Sam?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir."</P>
<P>"And in that room, I &s;uppo&s;e, my uncle &s;leeps."</P>
<P>"No, Sir, the other gentleman has that room&mdash;Sir James lies in this <HI>here,</HI> next to your's."</P>
<P>"Does that clock, that &s;tands at the end of the gallery, &s;trike the hours, Sam?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir."</P>
<P>"Do the lamps at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ach end of the gallery burn all night?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir, till near day light."</P>
<P>"Good night, Sam."</P>
<P>He retired to his chamber. The clock &s;truck twelve.&mdash;"One hour more!" exclaimed he. He paced about the chamber in agony of thought.&mdash;"Hu&s;h!" murmured he to him&s;elf, "I hear his aged foot&s;teps&mdash;he pa&s;&s;es my door&mdash;he enters his cham|ber. Will he lock the door?&mdash;no&mdash;he dreads the danger of fire, and rather tru&s;ts to man's mercy than a &s;en&s;ele&s;s element! Hark! he prays&mdash;Good God! he prays for me&mdash;even me! Li&s;ten!&mdash;'Re&s;tore his peace of mind.'&mdash;O, poor martyr! that's a vain petition&mdash;Alas, Milwood! what have I &s;worn to do?&mdash;But you cannot both live? Why, O, why was I permitted to &s;ee this hour!&mdash;Hark! the bed creaks&mdash;he lays his aged limbs to re&s;t&mdash;never, never more to ri&s;e!"</P>
<P>All was now perfect &s;ilence in the hou&s;e, &s;o that the da&s;hing of the ocean's waves were heard di&s;tinct|ly, the windows of that range of chambers overlook|ing the &s;ea. When he parted from Milwood &s;he had furni&s;hed him with a dagger, and gave him&punc; &s;mall packet, with an injunction not to open&punc; it till
<PB N="280" REF="038596_0279_10122DDD4A1F0C98">
the bell tolled one. This dagger he now drew from his bo&s;om, and placed it, with the packet on the table.</P>
<P>His reflections now grew more and more tormen|ting; his re&s;olution was an hundred times &s;haken, and rai&s;ed again by the memory of Milwood. When the idea of her public death ru&s;hed acro&s;s his brain, madne&s;s nerved his arm, and he often gra&s;ped the dagger in a &s;tate of phren&s;y.</P>
<P>In this horrible conflict the hour pa&s;&s;ed away; the clock in the gallery &s;truck one. A chilly &s;weat dewed his whole frame&mdash;his blood &s;hot like a bolt of ice to his heart. With a trembling hand he opened the packet; it contained a mo&s;t animating likene&s;s of Milwood, in miniature, and fully an&s;wered the purpo&s;e &s;he intended. A &s;mall &s;croll of paper con|tained, in her own hand writing, the&s;e words:&mdash;"If another hour elap&s;es, and the deed is not performed, you may gaze on the re&s;emblance of Milwood, but will never behold the original alive." He gazed on the portrait; he read the &s;croll again; again he contemplated the miniature&mdash;he ki&s;&s;ed it with fervour&mdash;his brain grew inflamed&mdash;imagi|nation riotted&mdash;He ki&s;&s;ed the miniature again&mdash;he placed it in his bo&s;om, gra&s;ped the dagger, and, throwing off his &s;lippers, opened his chamber door. Not a breath moved along the gallery&mdash;he &s;tood trembling for a few moments, fearfully gazing around him&mdash;his &s;hadow on the floor &s;tartled him&mdash;he &s;huddered. Once more he drew the portrait from his bo&s;om, and looked on it by the light reflected from the lamp. Summoning a de&s;perate effort, he made two or three &s;trides, and found him&s;elf in his uncle's chamber. He clo&s;ed the door after him, and approached the bed-&s;ide. A chamber lamp burned in the fire place: by this light, as he leaned again&s;t the feet of the bed, he perceived his uncle &s;lept. At that moment he fancied, that he heard a foot&s;tep in the gallery&mdash;he li&s;tened, and was confirmed it was &s;o. He fixed his eyes upon the door in horrid dread

of a detectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and half concealed the dagger in his bo&s;om, &s;till holding the candle. No one entered&mdash;all was again &s;ilent. Once more he &s;lowly drew the dagger forth, and once more turned his eyes upon his &s;leeping uncle. The dim, faint light, emitted from the lamp, ju&s;t &s;erved to di&s;cover his tranquil features. His lips were clo&s;ed in a &s;mile, that in|dicated peaceful &s;lumbers. As he contemplated this &s;cene, a deep groan pierced the ears of Barnwell: frozen with horror he dared not to turn his head towards the gallery, whence it &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue, but remained fixed as a &s;tatue. In another moment a voice, &s;oftly, but di&s;tinctly, uttered&mdash;"I'll &s;it all night on his cold, cold grave!" He fancied it was the voice of his &s;i&s;ter. The dagger fell from his &s;en&s;ele&s;s hand, and he clung to the pillars of the bed|&s;tead for &s;upport. Waked by the noi&s;e and motion, his uncle &s;tarted up. Barnwell, in&s;tigated by a &s;ud|den impul&s;e, in which fear was an ingredient, &s;natched up the dagger, &s;prung upon the brea&s;t of the vene|rable old man, and plunged its fatal point deep in his heart! One groan only preceded his di&s;&s;olution!</P>
<P>The moment the fatal blow was &s;truck, remor&s;e was kindled, with all its horrors, in the brea&s;t of Barnwell; a remor&s;e too powerful for words or ac|tion; it was a con&s;uming fire kindled in the centre of his heart. In a few moments the &s;ame voice he had heard before, exclaimed&mdash;"In heaven he will be mine, for Milwood cannot come to heaven." Rou&s;|ed to madne&s;s, he ru&s;hed like lightning to the door, opened it without regard to the noi&s;e he made, and beheld, &s;itting in her night gown at his own room door, Maria Freeman. This amiable and afflicted girl, &s;till the victim of concealed affection, grew hourly wor&s;e. Her mind con&s;tantly fixed on the object of her love, was now impre&s;&s;ed with the no|tion of his death, and her attendant having fallen a&s;leep, the lovely maniac had left her bed under the impre&s;&s;ion of vi&s;iting his tomb. The noi&s;e and his appearance cau&s;ed her to utter the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> violent
<PB N="282" REF="038596_0281_10122F671AD51078">
&s;hrieks, which brought Mr. Sandall and the &s;ervants to be witne&s;&s;es to a &s;cene of the utmo&s;t horror! Barnwell, taking the advantage of their confu&s;ion, bur&s;t through them all, and fled, with incredible &s;peed towards the cottage.</P>
<P>Urged on by an in&s;tinctive &s;en&s;e of danger, &s;carce|ly knowing the route he took, and, without be&s;tow|ing a thought on the certain con&s;equences of his &s;udden flight, he pur&s;ued his way. Each &s;tep he took, he trembled; even the falling leaf that floated in the air, alarmed him. As he approached the &s;ea, the roaring of the water appalled his guilty &s;oul with terror. If, for a minute, he rai&s;ed his eyes from the ground, the mo&s;t horrid images floated be|fore them. His uncle's mangled, bleeding corp&s;e, his father's angry gho&s;t, the very torments of the damned racked his imagination! The gloomy a&s;pect of the heavens aided the force of the&s;e guilt-born terrors, and rendered his &s;ituation horrible beyond expre&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>With difficulty he at length found the wicket gate of the cottage&mdash;it was locked, nor could all the noi&s;e he was capable of making gain him admi&s;&s;ion. Dreading to remain unhou&s;ed, he endeavoured to explore an entrance at the back of the garden, by climbing up to the arbour from the &s;ands. The tide was flowing rapidly in, and he found he had no time to lo&s;e. By per&s;everance, &s;purred on by the de&s;peration of his mind, he gained, at length a foot|ing on a part of the cliff, that overhung the &s;ea, and was within a few paces of the arbour.</P>
<P>Exhau&s;ted with fatigue, and overpowered by the conflicting exerci&s;es of his mind, he threw him&s;elf down on the rock, with a groan of agony. The fever of the &s;oul bacame exchanged for a mo&s;t awful lan|guor&mdash;he dared not to think. The roaring of the waters underneath, at length, arou&s;ed him, and the horrors of his &s;ituation fla&s;hed once more acro&s;s his imagination.</P>
<P>At that moment, ri&s;ing from the ground, he felt
<PB N="283" REF="038596_0282_10122F69745EB918">
&s;trongly impelled to plunge from the precipice on which he &s;tood into the gulph of waters; but almo&s;t at the &s;ame in&s;tant, the murmuring of approaching whi&s;pers &s;tartled him, and arre&s;ted his attention. It was too dark to di&s;cern their faces; but he could di&s;tingui&s;h a man and woman plainly, as the former carried a lantern in his hand. They approached the edge of the cliff, and appeared to make towards the &s;pot where he &s;tood. A little to the right there was a &s;pot, where the chalk had fallen away &s;ome feet in depth, and left a hollow &s;pace. Here he crept and concealed him&s;elf. In a few moments they were clo&s;e to the place of his concealment&mdash;A voice, which he too well knew, now &s;truck his car&mdash;'twas Mil|wood's.</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid &s;he, "how is the tide?"</P>
<P>"Coming in," &s;aid the man, who was Zelotti; "but it won't do this tide; it will be break of day ere there be &s;ufficient depth of water."</P>
<P>"Cur&s;ed delay!" cried Milwood; "what mu&s;t be done with the body, then?"</P>
<P>"Let it remain in the &s;ack, under the &s;eat in the arbour, till another night."</P>
<P>"That might do, if we were certain of remain|ing here; but I dread the morning, Zelotti. Fool that I was, to tru&s;t a work of &s;uch a nature to his hands. If Barnwell &s;hould be detected in the act, or by his weakne&s;s di&s;cover it when done, we mu&s;t fly in&s;tantly, and then old Townley's corp&s;e would be di&s;covered, and his murder clearly traced to me."&mdash;[How poor Barnwell &s;huddered!]</P>
<P>"That's true," replied Zelotti. "Let me con&s;ider, as there are no marks of violence upon his per&s;on, &s;uppo&s;e we &s;trip him; the effects of the poi&s;on, in &s;welling the body, may pa&s;s well enough for the &s;ame effects produced by drowning; &s;o that if it floats, and is di&s;covered in the morning, there would be no ground of &s;u&s;picion."</P>
<P>"Quick then, about it!" cried Milwood; there has been too much delay.&mdash;O, Zelotti! if Barn|well's
<PB N="284" REF="038596_0283_10122F6BD1091D50">
heart were but moulded like our own, what a glorious harve&s;t &s;hould we reap!&mdash;But, my &s;oul mi&s;gives me&mdash;I fear his tenderne&s;s, his fooli&s;h re|mor&s;e.&mdash;Would this night were well over!"</P>
<P>They had now retired out of the hearing of Barnwell. He had, however, heard enough to petrify his &s;oul with horror!&mdash;It was plain that Milwood had poi&s;oned her father!&mdash;Language is not equal to the ta&s;k of de&s;cribing what now pa&s;&s;ed in his agonized bo&s;om! Dreading to meet them, he was compelled to keep his &s;ituation. Sooner than he imagined, they return|ed, and in a few moments the awful &s;ound &s;mote his ear of the fall of poor Mental's corp&s;e into it's grave of billows!&mdash;He could not check a deep groan at that in&s;tant.</P>
<P>"Did you hear any thing?" &s;aid Zelotti.</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Milwood; "<HI>you</HI> are not &s;urely turn|ing &s;uper&s;titious?"</P>
<P>"I am &s;ure I heard a groan," &s;aid Zelotti.</P>
<P>"Fancy&mdash;fancy&mdash;man," cried &s;he:&mdash;"Come, we have work to do&mdash;Peace to old Townley&mdash;now for his trea&s;ures."</P>
<P>They bent their way towards the arbour. Barn|well followed them with his eye. In their hurry they forgot the ladder by which they de&s;cended from the window of the arbour. He noticed this neglect, and, waiting a con&s;iderable time, his fir&s;t impul&s;e was to a&s;cend the ladder; but he checked it, and con|tinued wandering near the &s;pot till break of day.</P>
<P>The tortures inflicted by his con&s;cience became al|mo&s;t in&s;upportable, and he once again re&s;olved to die.</P>
<P>At the very moment, however, of acting upon this dreadful re&s;olution, an inde&s;cribable terror &s;eized him, and turned him from his purpo&s;e. The con|viction of a future &s;tate was &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed upon his mind, that, though &s;urrounded by mi&s;ery, he dared not to plunge, uncalled, into eternity. Again, when the horrible con&s;equences of his crime ru&s;hed in force upon his imagination, he felt almo&s;t irri&s;i&s;ti|bly
<PB N="285" REF="038596_0284_10122F6DA017D200">
impelled to e&s;cape them by the only means left&mdash;the guilt of &s;uicide!</P>
<P>Thus wretchedly pa&s;&s;ed the hours of darkne&s;s: now the torments of his &s;ituation drove him almo&s;t to &s;elf murder; and now the dread of what another world might prove, deterred him from the crime. Nor was the recent &s;cene he had witne&s;&s;ed the lea&s;t part of his pre&s;ent wretchedne&s;s&mdash;Sorrow for the fate of Mental, at any common period, would have pow|erfully afflicted him; put when the incontrovertible evidence of his own &s;ight and hearing proved to him the real character of Milwood, &s;urpri&s;e, agony, and de&s;pair took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul!</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of mind in which, early in the morning, Milwood and Zelotti di&s;covered the poor lo&s;t Barnwell. Anxiety re&s;pecting the body of the murdered Mental brought them to ob&s;erve if the tide had thrown it on the &s;hore. When Mil|wood fir&s;t &s;aw Barnwell, he was kneeling, his hands cla&s;ped, and his eyes were fixed on the ri&s;ing &s;un.</P>
<P>"Amazement!" exclaimed &s;he. "Barnwell! Barnwell!&mdash;Tell me, do my &s;en&s;es deceive me?"</P>
<P>Barnwell &s;urveyed me with a wild inquiring gaze, but &s;poke not.</P>
<P>"An&s;wer me," &s;aid &s;he; "does he live?"</P>
<P>"In heaven!" &s;aid Barnwell, &s;haking his head, and &s;hewing &s;ome blood upon his hands.</P>
<P>"Why then, are you here?" &s;aid &s;he; "you &s;hould have remained in your chamber, as I directed you, to avoid &s;u&s;picion.&mdash;Where is the dagger&mdash;where is the miniature?"</P>
<P>"By his bleeding corp&s;e!" &s;aid Barnwell, &s;o|lemnly.</P>
<P>"Fool!&mdash;madman!&mdash;Did you <HI>intend</HI> detection?&mdash;My portrait left in the room!&mdash;perhaps my letter too.&mdash;Zelotti, we mu&s;t fly&mdash;this in&s;tant we mu&s;t fly!&mdash;Away&mdash;away!&mdash;and leave this whimpering boy to the fate his folly merits."</P>
<P>She ca&s;t a look of contemptuous rage on him, and walked &s;wiftly towards the arbour, followed by Ze|lotti.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="038596_0285_101230FB7908BD10">
Barnwell, rou&s;ed from his &s;tupor of mi&s;ery, by this conduct, pur&s;ued them, exclaiming, as he went&mdash;"Milwood&mdash;Milwood&mdash;hear me!" At the foot of the ladder he &s;eized her hand eagerly&mdash;"Lo&s;t&mdash;lo&s;t woman!&mdash;Why am I &s;till anxious concerning you?&mdash;Why, even after you have driven me to per|dition, do I &s;till love you?&mdash;Why is it, that, though I know you a murderer, I cannot&mdash;cannot dete&s;t you?&mdash;O, then, li&s;ten to me, Milwood; and, in&s;tead of attempting, to e&s;cape the ju&s;t puni&s;hment of our crimes, let us &s;urrender our&s;elves to death, as the only atone|ment in our power, and devote the few hours we may live in preparing for eternity!"</P>
<P>"Canting babe&mdash;preaching infant!" cried Mil|wood, &s;cornfully. "Know, fool, that &s;he, to whom you preach, is of a nature above indulging &s;uch dreams, as haunt children of prejudice, and dupes of prie&s;t-craft, like your&s;elf. She &s;coffs your coun&s;el, and de&s;pi&s;es you for offering it. To you, and &s;uch as you, &s;he leaves it to bend the neck &s;up|mi&s;&s;ively to laws and ordinances. Her life is her all; &s;he dreams of no future worlds, nor dreads ac|counts hereafter. On &s;uch, the puny fears of others, &s;he builds her towering projects, and would not &s;cru|ple, if &s;he had the power, to hurl yon blazing orb of light from its fixed centre to de&s;troy whole &s;y&s;tems, that oppo&s;ed her purpo&s;e."</P>
<P>"Can human nature fall &s;o low?" cried Barnwell, "can that, which we are taught to believe emanates from Deity it&s;elf, become infernal?"</P>
<P>"Who is this Deity you &s;peak of?&mdash;Where is his power?&mdash;If he exi&s;ts, why did he &s;uffer you, a villain, maddened by lu&s;t, to murder &s;leeping inno|cence?&mdash;Fool!&mdash;fool!&mdash;fool!&mdash;Away, Zelotti."</P>
<P>"Yet, one moment, hold," cried Barnwell. "Where is my friend&mdash;where is Townley? O, what mu&s;t be your agony, Milwood, when you hear, that Townley, he who&s;e murdered corp&s;e, la&s;t night, you yielded to the deep, was&mdash;your father!"</P>
<P>"Already is the mighty &s;ecret known!" &s;aid &s;he.
<PB N="287" REF="038596_0286_101230FE45C43DF8">
"I know he was my father&mdash;I own, too, that the&s;e hands mixed and admini&s;tered the do&s;e that poi&s;oned him!&mdash;Where was the Deity you talk of, <HI>then?</HI>&mdash;Why did not his power, if he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, prevent &s;o foul a deed? I knew not, <HI>at the moment,</HI> that he was my father: the contents of his ca&s;ket, and his papers told me, that he had played a character that he was not in reality, and he has fallen in con&s;equence.&mdash;'Tis po&s;&s;ible he might have lived, but for his de|ception."</P>
<P>Barnwell was petrified with horror and a&s;toni&s;h|ment!</P>
<P>"In a few hours," continued Milwood, as &s;he a&s;|cended the ladder, "&s;ome dungeon may immer&s;e us, if we remain, Zelotti.&mdash;Come, then, nor let us wa&s;te the pre&s;ent opportunity."</P>
<P>As &s;he uttered the la&s;t words, &s;he entered the ar|bour by the window. In the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;he &s;hriek|ed violently, and three men ru&s;hed down the ladder, from the window, and &s;ecured Barnwell and Zelotti. The ravings of Milwood were too horrible to de&s;|cribe. During their ab&s;ence from the cottage, Mr. Sandall, attended by &s;everal of the dome&s;tics, and conducted by the information found in Barnwell's papers, had arrived there, and forced the outer gates. As the garden door was open, they had ju&s;t entered the arbour, when the voice of Barnwell arre&s;ted their attention; and concluding, from the replies of Mil|wood, that &s;he was returning, they &s;tationed them|&s;elves in &s;uch a manner as to &s;ecure her when &s;he entered. The criminals were immediately conveyed before a magi&s;trate, and committed to pri&s;on. Mil|wood continued to rave. Zelotti loaded her with reproaches; but Barnwell &s;ilently hung down his head, and endeavoured to conceal the tears, that bedewed his pallid cheeks.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NIGHT approached&mdash;Milwood, who, during the whole day, had &s;ought, in vain, an opportunity of &s;elf-de&s;truction; at length, overcome by the violent exertions of de&s;pair, &s;unk on her pillow, and &s;lept. Two women, who were appointed to watch in her apartment, &s;oon after midnight, were arou&s;ed by the violent &s;hrieks which &s;he uttered in her &s;leep. Pierced to the heart by her exclamations, which &s;eemed to indicate the mo&s;t excruciating tortures of her mind, they were yet too &s;uper&s;titious to awake her. Several inhabitants of the pri&s;on, alarmed by her dreadful cries, entered the apartment, and &s;tood trembling round the bed of the de&s;pairing Milwood. Big drops of &s;weat rolled down her cheeks, her eyes were half open, her teeth gna&s;hed horribly, and her whole frame was &s;trongly convul&s;ed.</P>
<P>At length &s;tarting up in the bed, &s;he &s;eized the hand of a by-&s;tander, exclaiming, in a voice of horror&mdash;"Am I in hell?&mdash;O, torment me not, my fa|ther!&mdash;do not <HI>you</HI> inflict the tortures!&mdash;Barnwell&mdash;Barnwell&mdash;end my mi&s;eries!&mdash;O, they have torn my fle&s;h with burning pincers!&mdash;Now they are &s;hooting &s;parks of fire in my eyes&mdash;&s;corpions fa&s;ten on my brea&s;ts&mdash;and &s;ee, my murdered father fixes his gha&s;tly eyes on me!&mdash;Barnwell I own the deed:&mdash;thy uncle's bleeding gho&s;t approaches!&mdash;Save me&mdash;&s;ave me!&mdash;See, they bring more brands of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire&mdash;&s;howers of fire de&s;cend!&mdash;O, my heart burns&mdash;it burns&mdash;and yet I do not die!"</P>
<P>A &s;hivering fit now &s;eized her, and &s;he awoke. Ca&s;ting her eyes wildly round her, by degrees &s;he re|collected her &s;ituation. Among the pri&s;oners, who &s;tood near her, was a clergyman confined for debt.
<PB N="289" REF="038596_0288_10123101A15395F0">
Viewing the horrors of her mind, he was prompted to offer her &s;ome con&s;olation.</P>
<P>"Unhappy woman!" &s;aid he, "&s;ee the &s;ad con|&s;equences of guilt!&mdash;As yet thy terrors are only ima|ginary; may they prove &s;alutary, and lead you to &s;eek, by heart-felt penitence, that chri&s;tian hope of mercy, which alone can calm your mind!&mdash;Are you willing I &s;hould pray with you?"</P>
<P>She fixed her eyes upon him&mdash;"Mercy!" cried &s;he. "Penitence!&mdash;Pray for me!&mdash;To whom?"</P>
<P>"To your Almighty Judge!"</P>
<P>"There is not an Almighty Judge&mdash;'Tis fal&s;e, old man. There is not&mdash;cannot&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;there cannot be another world&mdash;or if there is, why am I tortured with the thought of it&mdash;when, if there is&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;O! no&mdash;no&mdash;do not &s;ay there is another world!"</P>
<P>"Surely, mo&s;t &s;urely, there is," &s;aid the good old man, with a vehemence that made her tremble.</P>
<P>She &s;truck her hand violently again&s;t her head.&mdash;"If, indeed, there &s;hould," exclaimed &s;he, "horrible thought!&mdash;I dare not think!&mdash;O, if you have any pity for my wretched lot, give me &s;ome potent draught, &s;ome cordial, that will drown all &s;en&s;e of what is pa&s;t&mdash;all dread of what may come!"</P>
<P>The worthy mini&s;ter, who truly merited the title of a chri&s;tian prie&s;t, exerted every effort to &s;ooth the workings of de&s;pair. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the idle gazers from the room, and was in the act of kneeling to offer up a prayer, when the poor object of his &s;olici|tude &s;hrieked violently, and implored him to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>"'Tis torture&mdash;torture&mdash;torture!" cried &s;he; "I am accur&s;ed, and I hate all good!"</P>
<P>Finding his attentions increa&s;ed her de&s;pair in her pre&s;ent frame of mind, he de&s;i&s;ted, in the hope of a more tranquil moment. By his advice, they permit|ted her to take &s;ome wine, and &s;he, once more, &s;eem|ed to &s;leep. But a few minutes, however, had elap|&s;ed, ere &s;he awoke again, under the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ions of horror!</P>

Mr. Elderton, the clergyman, had not left the room, but had employed him&s;elf in &s;ilent prayer. Her de|&s;pair now ro&s;e to fury; her expre&s;&s;ions were horribly bla&s;phemous, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance was nece&s;&s;ary to keep her in her bed. Her exertions were fatal. In the pa|roxy&s;m of her de&s;pair &s;he bur&s;t a blood ve&s;&s;el; the blood gu&s;hed rapidly from her mouth, and notwith|&s;tanding every po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance was in&s;tantly pro|cured, before the &s;un aro&s;e, de&s;pairing &s;he expired!</P>

<P>THE worthy clergyman, who had witne&s;&s;ed the dreadful death of Milwood, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nfluenced by the pure motives of chri&s;tian charity, determined to vi&s;it the fallen victim of her wiles. Sad change had marked the face of Barnwell. The horror of guilt had mar|red one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> countenances nature ever form|ed. No more the ro&s;y glow of health adorned his cheek; no more the &s;mile of innocence and peace hung on his lips; no longer the tranquillity that once dwelt in his bo&s;om beamed from his eyes! Bitter mi&s;|ery had traced its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> characters o'er all his wa&s;ted
<PB N="291" REF="038596_0290_10123108F0AD6D00">
form. At the entrance of Mr. Elderton he &s;tarted; but &s;till kept his eyes on the floor.</P>
<P>"I have intruded," &s;aid Mr. Elderton, "upon hours which, I hope, are devoted to penitence, to announce to you the melancholy end of&mdash;."</P>
<P>"O, God!" cried Barnwell, cla&s;ping his hands together, "my mother&mdash;I have &s;lain my mother!"</P>
<P>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no," &s;aid Mr. Elderton, eager to un|deceive him, "I &s;peak of the unhappy partners of your guilt, who are now no more. The wretched woman died by the bur&s;ting of a blood ve&s;&s;el in a pa|roxy&s;m of de&s;pair, and the man has poi&s;oned him|&s;elf!"</P>
<P>"God forgive them!" cried Barnwell, "God for|give them!&mdash;Poor Milwood!"</P>
<P>Even in his pre&s;ent awful &s;ituation, a pang &s;hot through his heart, when he heard &s;he was gone for ever!</P>
<P>"You mentioned a mother, Sir," &s;aid Mr. Elder|ton; "have you a mother?</P>
<P>"O, &s;pare me, I be&s;eech you, whoever you are, &s;pare my poor bur&s;ting heart the angui&s;h of that thought!"</P>
<P>At that moment the door was thrown open, and Mrs. Barnwell, Eliza, and Mr. Sandall, were in the room. The rumour of Barnwell's ab&s;conding, by &s;ome means had reached them, and they immediate|ly followed Sir James to Ram&s;gate. Soon as the wretched mother &s;aw the object, which guilt had rendered her &s;on; when attempting to meet her, his fetters grated on her ears, overcome by the horrid vi|&s;ion, &s;he &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor. Eliza fainted on the bo&s;om of her brother, and the pri&s;on rung with the imprecations of Barnwell on his own guilty head!</P>
<P>By the direction of Mr. Sandall, who&s;e folly had permitted the interview, they were torn a&s;under, and conveyed home to the hou&s;e that had been Mr. Emery's. The &s;hock which Mrs. Barnwell had received was &s;evere, and its effects, even when her &s;en&s;es return|ed,
<PB N="292" REF="038596_0291_1012310A9D8ADDC0">
confined her to her bed, and rendered the attend|ance of a phy&s;ician nece&s;&s;ary. Eliza, who loved her brother almo&s;t to adoration, &s;uffered an inconceivable pain of heart; but her youth enabled her to &s;u&s;tain the blow with le&s;s injury to her health, than their un|happy parent: an alarming attack of the a&s;thma, to which &s;he was &s;ubject, occa&s;ioned &s;erious apprehen|&s;ions of her life. Though the dutiful and affection|ate Eliza would not quit her bed &s;ide, &s;he yet divided her painfully anxious thoughts between the &s;ick couch of her parent, and the &s;ad de&s;tiny of her brother.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Barnwell &s;truggled to meet his fate with re&s;ignation; and if, at times, the horrors that &s;urrounded him opened an avenue for thoughts of &s;uicide, the truly pious. Elderton was con&s;tantly, at hand to admini&s;ter the con&s;olations of hope to his de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Some days pa&s;&s;ed, during which the remains of Sir James Barnwell were conveyed to his late &s;eat, and interred. Mrs. Barnwell remained confined to the bed of &s;ickne&s;s, and very &s;lender hope was entertain|ed of her recovery.</P>
<P>The unfortunate victim of unlimited confidence, Mr. Freeman, had received from the numerous and injured creditors of his hou&s;e, that di&s;criminating ge|nero&s;ity, for which the merchants of London are celebrated in every part of the globe. He received an immediate and full di&s;charge, upon a&s;&s;igning over all his e&s;tates, from which an annuity of &s;ix hun|dred pounds, for his own life and that of his daugh|ter, were liberally &s;ettled upon them-by the unani|mous voice of the creditors, in oppo&s;ition only to his own &s;incere wi&s;hes to the contrary. Mr. Drudge likewi&s;e experienced their liberality; but the exa&s;|peration of the majority of the creditors was fully di&s;played in their conduct to Emery, who, abandoned by his titled friends, was left literally de&s;titute, and being unable to procure his certificate, the vengeance of &s;everal pur&s;ued him &s;o far as to terminate the fu|ture pro&s;pects of his exi&s;tence with the gloomy evils of confinement.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="038596_0292_1012310D58D18BD0">
Such was the &s;ituation of his affairs when Mr. Freeman returned to Ram&s;gate, after the funeral of his old friend Sir James, who had left him his exec|utor. The greate&s;t part of his e&s;tates were bequeath|ed to his wretched nephew, and, in failure of i&s;&s;ue, to his &s;i&s;ter and her de&s;cendants. Very hand&s;ome provi&s;ion was made for Mrs. Barnwell and Eliza, and, excepting a few complimentary legacies, no part of his property was bequeathed out of the family of his brother. The horrid deed of Barnwell received a &s;till deeper tint of horror, by the benevolent intentions thus di&s;played.</P>
<P>Not the combined wealth of worlds, is able to era|dicate the cankering &s;peck of guilt, or prevent that cour&s;e of con&s;equences which nature has decreed. Never, perhaps, was the in&s;ufficiency of wealth to make the heart happy, more powerfully proved than in the mi&s;erable Barnwell's.</P>
<P>As the awful day of public trial drew near, the channels of grief flowed in more painful violence through the hearts of this mo&s;t wretched family. The good and tender-hearted Freeman &s;ympathi&s;ed deep|ly with the mourners, and &s;tole occa&s;ionally a thought from the melancholy image of his beloved daughter, bereft of rea&s;on, to mingle &s;orrows with them.</P>
<P>Barnwell had particularly reque&s;ted to be alone, and peremptorily refu&s;ed the vi&s;its of all but the pi|ous Elderton. By the&s;e means he gradually prepared his mind for tho&s;e awful scenes which he was &s;hortly to encounter. Eliza, who&s;e mind was con&s;iderably above the common level, calling the energies of rea|&s;on and the hopes of religion to her aid, thus temper|ed the &s;en&s;ibility of her heart to &s;u&s;tain the mi&s;eries that pre&s;&s;ed heavily upon her. The following letter will exhibit the &s;tate of her mind.</P>

<P>The &s;olemn moment now arrived, that placed Barnwell at the bar of temporal ju&s;tice. The court was crowded with &s;pectators, and as his fatal &s;tory was generally known, there was &s;carcely an individ|ual pre&s;ent, who&s;e eye did not te&s;tify the compa&s;&s;ion of his heart.

Evil is in the world; and man's be&s;t employ is to avoid its certain con&s;equen|ces, as much as po&s;&s;ible him&s;elf, and, if he have be|nevolence of heart, &s;tudy to ameliorate its &s;ad effects on others. There is, there mu&s;t be, a recompence for virtue, oft denied here, &s;ince even guilty wretch|es, like my&s;elf, can feel a hope, that &s;u&s;tains the &s;oul at the approach of ignominious death!&mdash;A hope not to be defined&mdash;a hope beyond their comprehen&s;ion, who do not feel its influence. Yet is it not le&s;s real, le&s;s worth re&s;earch; for, in the agonies of di&s;&s;olution, what &s;ounds &s;o &s;oothing to the &s;oul, as the &s;weet voice

<P>The&s;e were the la&s;t words he wrote. The hour of &s;uffering, of &s;hame, of death arrived, and Barnwell having penitently yielded to the con&s;equences of his crimes, his liberated &s;pirit winged its trembling flight to the bright throne of mercy!</P>
<P>The pangs a mother felt at this &s;ad cata&s;tophe, who can de&s;cribe? Happily they were &s;hort&mdash;&s;oon the welcome herald, Death, arrived, and changed tho&s;e temporal &s;cenes, a &s;on's crimes had rendered painful, for views of bli&s;s no clouds can ever darken! Maria, too, fell, like a blighted blo&s;&s;om, to the earth, and with her la&s;t &s;igh mingled the name of Barnwell.</P>
<P>The worthy Mr. Freeman met the event with calm, yet heart-felt &s;orrow. The painful vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, re&s;erved for this, the evening of his life, had bowed his mind; and having &s;tripped him of this his la&s;t hold on earthly bli&s;s, he endured, with re&s;ignation, an exi&s;tence of tranquillity, almo&s;t with|out a hope, or an anxiety!</P>
<P>Eliza, the &s;i&s;ter of Barnwell, became his charge, and if ever a temporal concern floated in his mind, it was on her account. By the recent &s;ad events &s;he acquired the very large property of her late uncle, and retired with her guardian to his re&s;idence. Sor|row oft vi&s;ited her in this retirement, when memory mu&s;ed on melancholy &s;cenes gone by. Yet Eliza &s;truggled with regret: &s;he had imbibed &s;ome early le&s;&s;ons of &s;ound and pure philo&s;ophy, the advantages of which now &s;hone con&s;picuous. She contemplated, with earne&s;tne&s;s, her &s;ituation, and the &s;tronge&s;t feeling of her heart was a dread, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;hould mi&s;apply the loan of wealth, which Heaven had en|tru&s;ted to her care.</P>
<P>Her next concern was, to render Mr. Freeman as happy as her &s;oci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ty and means could make him, and &s;he aimed with zealous diligence to amu&s;e his reflec|tion from the pa&s;t. The &s;it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ation of the Mi&s;s Eme|ry's and their mother, attracted her attention, and

indulged her with an opportunity of exerci&s;ing that benevolence, which was the chief trait in her cha|racter. With the con&s;ent of Mr. Freeman, &s;he af|forded them an a&s;ylum in her hou&s;e, and &s;tudied to make their dependence as little felt as po&s;&s;ible. She frequently enabled the daughters, by her genero&s;ity, to remit tho&s;e comforts to their father, which ameli|orated the horrors of confinement; and &s;he looked forward to the termination of her minority for the plea&s;ing ability of placing them beyond the fear of dependence, by the &s;ettlement of an annuity, that would en&s;ure them, with frugality, the decencies, though not the luxuries, of life.</P>
<P>In &s;uch delightful employ, we leave Eliza, who&s;e di&s;criminating genero&s;ity afforded her many heart|felt plea&s;ures, and the exerci&s;e of which was her con|&s;tant re&s;ource, whenever memory pointed to the con|&s;equences of CONCEALED ERRORS in the melancholy fate of her brother.</P>
