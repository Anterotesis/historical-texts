<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MY principal de&s;ign in the pre&s;ent publi|cation, is to e&s;tabli&s;h the truth re&s;pecting the origin of the yellow fever in this country; and, to communicate what appears to me to be an improvement, in the treatment of that dangerous malady.</P>
<P>The intelligent reader will perceive, that the pre&s;ent performance contains &s;ome &s;entiments in &s;ome re&s;pects different from tho&s;e I former|ly entertained, and particularly with re&s;pect to the identity of the yellow fever with that of the typhus gravior or common malignant fever of camps and ho&s;pitals: I therefore beg leave to remind him, that knowledge mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be progre&s;&s;ive on new and intricate &s;ubjects; and that &s;ince my former publica|tions, additional ob&s;ervations and more am|ple and accurate views, have afforded me more correct ideas on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="037274_0003_100CA4D36D8AC488">
It is my &s;incere wi&s;h that all ambiguity &s;hould be removed, and the truth e&s;tabli&s;hed independent of every other con&s;ideration: if therefore any material mi&s;takes &s;hould be di&s;covered in the following pages, I &s;hall e&s;teem the correction of them as an act of friend&s;hip; for I con&s;ider the &s;ituation of a man to be &s;ingularly unfortunate, who, while he is &s;eeking to enlighten others, is walking in the dark him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>A SKETCH, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t ca&s;es of the pe&s;tilential or yellow fe|ver that occurred la&s;t year in Philadelphia, were in the neighbourhood of Me&s;&s;rs. Willing and Francis's wharf, between Pine and Lombard-&s;treets, near the &s;outhern boundary of the city: and in &s;outhwark, in the neighbourhood of the &s;till-hou&s;e wharf, with|in a few paces of the Swedes church.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ca&s;es that have come to my knowledge in the neighbourhood of the fir&s;t mentioned wharf, were the following, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> A young woman at No. 17, about the 15th or 16th of June; Mr. A&s;h|mead, a little lower down in Front-&s;treet, on the 17th, who died on the 23d. Mr. Thomas, who had been on board a ve&s;&s;el from Curracoa, and came from the quarantine ground the 15th, was taken ill with the fever on the 17th. A &s;hoemaker's boy, on the 21&s;t, was moved from Southwark to Arch near Seventh-&s;treet and there died. Mr. John
<PB N="6" REF="037274_0005_100CA4D8EF889440">
M'Donald, who lodged near Me&s;&s;rs. Willing and Francis's wharf, at No. 17, Penn-&s;treet, directly back of the wharf, was attacked on the 24th and died on the 29th. The mate of a &s;now from Hamburgh, at that time lying at the &s;ame wharf, was al&s;o taken with the fever on the 24th and died on the 29th.</P>
<P>The next ca&s;es in the order of time that occurred in the neighbourhood of that wharf, were, a young woman at Mr. Samuel Rhoads's, on the 25th, who died on the 30th: Mr. Smith, who had been on board of two ve&s;&s;els at the wharf, on the 27th: Captain Ro&s;s's daughter on the 28th, and his wife about the fir&s;t of July: Mr. Thomas Cuthbert on the 27th or 28th of June. Mr. James Smith's &s;on, in Lombard-&s;treet, who had been on the wharf marking ca&s;ks belonging to the Hamburgh &s;now, was attacked on the 28th of June. Several other ca&s;es occurred in the &s;ame neighbourhood a few days later; and from tho&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e gradually &s;pread into different parts of the city.</P>
<P>A &s;mall &s;loop called the Molly, prize to the Ganges, had lain at the wharf near the place where the fir&s;t ca&s;es of the fever commenced, from the 13th of May. Her cargo, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of coffee, was landed and &s;tored near the wharf early in June: her hatches were kept &s;hut till the 21&s;t of June, at which time they were opened on ac|count
<PB N="7" REF="037274_0006_100CA4DA77A13218">
of the &s;tench proceeding from her, and ac|cording to the account of Samuel Fi&s;her, who had the care of her, 500 buckets of water were thrown into her to clean and &s;weeten her. The bedding of &s;ome of the &s;eamen that came in her, were left on board: the prize ma&s;ter and &s;eamen that brought her in had left her. She was employed trading from Turk's i&s;land to St. Domingo, at the time of her capture. No per&s;ons were then &s;ick on board, nor did any one become &s;ick while navi|gating her into port. The prize ma&s;ter became &s;ick &s;oon after her arrival, but I have not learned what became of him.</P>
<P>Near this &s;loop lay a &s;now from Hamburgh, the mate and cook, and one of the &s;eamen of which &s;ickened &s;oon after the hatches of the Molly were opened, and two of them died with malig|nant &s;ymptoms, the other recovered. Mr. Smith's &s;on was near the &s;loop marking ca&s;ks le&s;s than a week before his attack: he recovered. During the time the &s;loop lay at Me&s;&s;rs. Willing and Francis's wharf, the &s;hip Amiable-Creole, from Havanna, arrived at the city, and came to at the wharf next to Willing and Francis's, called Nixon's wharf. Re&s;pecting this la&s;t ve&s;&s;el I have been able to obtain no &s;atisfactory information. Mr. Holling&s;|worth's lighters al&s;o landed the cargoes of &s;everal ve&s;&s;els from the We&s;t Indies, while under quaran|tine,
<PB N="8" REF="037274_0007_100CA4DCB9156B28">
upon or near the &s;ame wharf, at different times in the early part of June.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ca&s;es in the order of time that occurred in the neighbourhood of the &s;till-hou&s;e wharf, were two boys belonging to the Eliza from Leghorn. The&s;e boys were attacked with malignant &s;ymptoms on the 24th of June, and &s;ent down to the Marine Ho&s;pital, where one of them died. Mr. Shortall, the owner of the &s;till-hou&s;e wharf, was taken ill with the fever about the 26th of June, and with difficulty recovered. James Arthur, Brady and M'Clary, worked in the loft of the &s;till-hou&s;e. Arthur was taken ill on the 29th of June, and died with &s;ymptoms of high malignity and very yellow &s;kin, in &s;ix days. Brady and M'Clary were taken ill a few days later. Brady died&mdash;M'Clary recovered.</P>
<P>Mrs. Burk and her hu&s;band vi&s;ited Mr. Shortall during his illne&s;s: Mrs. Burk was taken ill with fever on the 2d of July; her nur&s;e, little &s;on, and an apprentice boy, a few days later&mdash;the appren|tice died; the other three recovered.</P>
<P>The Eliza was removed on the 21&s;t of June to Mr. M'Cullough's wharf, at Queen-&s;treet, a &s;hort &s;quare above the &s;till-hou&s;e, for the purpo&s;e of re|ceiving repairs. Mr. M'Cullough's &s;on was attack|ed
<PB N="9" REF="037274_0008_100CA4DEC2A137C0">
a few days after, and &s;everal in the &s;ame family in le&s;s than two weeks.</P>
<P>At the time the Eliza came to the &s;till-hou&s;e wharf, which was on the 19th of June, two ve&s;&s;els lately arrived from the We&s;t Indies lay at it, the one a &s;chooner called the Minerva, on the 9th, the other a brigantine called the Abigail, on the 17th of June. The&s;e being neare&s;t the &s;hore, the Eliza took her &s;tation along &s;ide of them. Mr. Green, in a &s;mall &s;loop with naval &s;tores from North Caro|lina, came to the &s;ame wharf before the Eliza left it. The ve&s;&s;el commanded by Mr. Green left the wharf the 23d or 24th of June, and proceeded on her homeward voyage, but was forced, on account of &s;ickne&s;s which had &s;eized him&s;elf and crew, to put into Milford, on Mu&s;kmellon creek in Dela|ware &s;tate, about 100 miles from Philadelphia, where the ma&s;ter, one hand and a pa&s;&s;enger died, and only one recovered. The dates of the preced|ing account are taken from Mr. Shortall's wharf book.</P>
<P>The College of Phy&s;icians held a &s;pecial meet|ing on the 28th of June, and agreed to inform the Board of Health, that a malignant fever of the &s;ame nature as that which occurred in Philadelphia in the years 1793, 1797 and 1798, had appeared in Penn-&s;treet and its vicinity, and recommended
<PB N="10" REF="037274_0009_100CA4E143FC5708">
the removal of all ve&s;&s;els as well as the inhabitants from that neighbourhood, and the prevention of intercour&s;e between the inhabitants of the infected parts and tho&s;e that were &s;till healthy, which at that time was the ca&s;e with every part of the city to the north of Spruce and we&s;t of Front-&s;treet.</P>
<P>On the 2d of July the College received an an|&s;wer from the Board of Health, informing them that they could not coincide in &s;entiment with them, regarding the propriety of i&s;&s;uing a procla|mation, or giving directions for the removal of the inhabitants from the part of the town they had &s;pecified, or the ve&s;&s;els from the wharves adjoin|ing, becau&s;e &s;uch public notification would perhaps excite a terror, that might add to the predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, if any &s;uch exi&s;ted. They were convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of early precau|tion, but they al&s;o dreaded to give an alarm which mu&s;t injuriou&s;ly affect the welfare of the city, and which might perhaps eventually be unnece&s;&s;ary; the con&s;equence of which as it regarded the health was doubtful, but which would certainly operate powerfully again&s;t the intere&s;t of the citizens.</P>
<P>Though a few ca&s;es of the yellow fever occurred before the middle of June, its progre&s;s was &s;o &s;low, that only twenty-two ca&s;es had come to the know|ledge of all the members of the College of Phy&s;i|cians from that time to the 6th of July. That
<PB N="11" REF="037274_0010_100CA4E2CDB5CFB8">
the Board of Health might not be deceived, and the citizens lulled to a fatal &s;ecurity by this cir|cum&s;tance, one of the members of the College &s;ent them the following letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO THE BOARD OF HEALTH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>July</HI> 11<HI>th,</HI> '99.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I expect you all recollect, that every time the pe&s;tilential or yellow fever has occurred in this city, &s;ince the year 1793, it has made its fir&s;t appear|ance near &s;ome one of the wharves of the city on the Delaware, and that it has been confined for the fir&s;t week or more to the particular neighbour|hood where it was fir&s;t ob&s;erved, or to per&s;ons who&s;e occupations led them to frequent that parti|cular part, or had bu&s;ine&s;s with ve&s;&s;els or cargoes recently arrived; and that after the death or reco|very of tho&s;e fir&s;t attacked, it has made a remark|able though a partial pau&s;e, after which it has gra|dually &s;pread or been conveyed into more di&s;tant parts, and has rapidly advanced with the advancing &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>This having been the &s;tate of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the fever in former years, what rea&s;on have we to expect a different event this year?</P>
<P>We learn from pa&s;t ob&s;ervations, that a cer|tain condition of the atmo&s;phere mu&s;t concur with
<PB N="12" REF="037274_0011_100CA4E50BF16B38">
the matter of contagion, before the di&s;ea&s;e can be communicated from one to another, or be propa|gated by contagion (which is the only way it can be propagated.) What that preci&s;e condition of the atmo&s;phere is, which favours the communica|tion of the di&s;ea&s;e from one to another, has not yet been unequivocally a&s;certained; but from the cir|cum&s;tance of the di&s;ea&s;e not being communicated in high, dry, open and airy &s;ituations in the coun|try, during the &s;ea&s;on when it is mo&s;t highly &s;o in the city, which is a fact, with a few extraordinary exceptions, well e&s;tabli&s;hed, it amounts to a degree of probability almo&s;t equal to certainty, that the atmo&s;phere where the di&s;ea&s;e prevails and is readi|ly communicated from one to another, mu&s;t not only be of a certain temperature, but at the &s;ame time calm, confined or motionle&s;s, and, perhaps contaminated with exhalations from putrefying ve|getable or animal &s;ub&s;tances, or from living animal bodies deprived of fre&s;h and purer air in clo&s;e and confined &s;ituations, which render it a fit conductor for the matter of contagion, at the &s;ame time that the air thus contaminated, by impairing the inhe|rent powers of the body, predi&s;po&s;es it to be more ea&s;ily acted upon by the contagion, not only of pe&s;ti|lential, but of &s;hip, ho&s;pital, jail, or nervous fevers.</P>
<P>A few ca&s;es of the yellow fever have certainly appeared in the lower part of this city already this &s;ea&s;on, amounting in the whole, exclu&s;ive of
<PB N="13" REF="037274_0012_100CA4E72179FDF8">
ambiguous ones, to twenty-one; and of the&s;e twenty-one, eleven have died. The exi&s;ting ca&s;es at pre&s;ent are indeed very few; and if we could depend upon the continuance of the pure and fluctuating &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere in the city which at pre&s;ent prevails, there would be no &s;eri|ous cau&s;e of apprehen&s;ion. But as it is impo&s;&s;ible to judge with any degree of certainty, in &s;o change|able a climate, how long the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, &s;o unfavourable to the operation of contagion, may continue; and as there is the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to expect the revival and propaga|tion of the di&s;ea&s;e with all its complicated horrors, if an unfavourable change &s;hould take place in the atmo&s;phere, while any of the matter of contagion remains, however &s;mall in quantity, and however ob&s;curely it may lurk, or if it &s;hould by any means be again introduced: and, believing that the &s;afe|ty of the citizens, and perhaps the future pro&s;pe|rity of the city, depend upon the mea&s;ures you may devi&s;e or adopt for averting a calamity &s;o awfully di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, I beg leave to offer to your &s;erious con&s;ideration the following account of the means employed with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, in other countries, for preventing pe&s;tilential fevers from &s;preading or becoming epidemic.</P>
<P>"The magi&s;trates of the city of Ferrara in Italy, when all the &s;urrounding country was infected with a pe&s;tilential fever, ob&s;erving the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the
<PB N="14" REF="037274_0013_100CA4E9B4E0C9F8">
conduct of their neighbours, who, <HI>for fear of lo&s;ing their commerce,</HI> did all they could to conceal the di&s;ea&s;e, by keeping the &s;ick in their hou&s;es; re|&s;olved, whenever occa&s;ion &s;hould require, to take a different method: accordingly, as &s;oon as they di&s;covered that any per&s;on had died in their city of the di&s;ea&s;e, they immediately removed the whole family to which he belonged, or in which he died, to a &s;afe di&s;tance from the city."</P>
<P>"The example of Ferrara was afterwards fol|lowed by other towns in the &s;ame territory with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s. In con&s;equence of which it was thought expedient to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation for the information of the whole world: "That the only means of preventing pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es from &s;pread|ing or becoming epidemic, is to make the mo&s;t early di&s;covery of the di&s;ea&s;e that is po&s;&s;ible; and as &s;oon as its exi&s;tence is a&s;certained, to remove without delay, and without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, eve|ry &s;u&s;picious ca&s;e thereof, together with the family in which he re&s;ides, and every per&s;on in the &s;ame hou&s;e, with all their goods, furniture and apparel, to a &s;afe di&s;tance from the city, and to clean and purify the vacated dwellings before any per&s;on be permitted to reoccupy them."</P>
<P>"In addition to the above regulations, Dr. Ru&s;&s;el, who publi&s;hed an elaborate and voluminous treati&s;e on the plague in the year 1791, advi&s;es, that all
<PB N="15" REF="037274_0014_100CA4EB43687790">
who have had intercour&s;e with the &s;ick, or who have been expo&s;ed to infected articles, whether in|tentionally or not, be al&s;o compelled to leave the place where the di&s;ea&s;e has begun to appear, for a certain time.&mdash;"To permit the infected to remain in a populous city, is to collect magazines of con|tagion, &s;ooner or later to be di&s;tributed into every quarter, and of cour&s;e to convert a whole city into a theatre of di&s;ea&s;e and death."</P>
<P>By the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e regulations, Cardinal Ga&s;taldi, who was appointed commi&s;&s;ary general of health, with di&s;cretionary and unlimited powers, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the plague at Rome in the year 1657, after the di&s;ea&s;e had made con&s;iderable pro|gre&s;s. The Cardinal's rigorous proceedings at fir&s;t excited great popular di&s;content and clamour; but as he acted with impartiality, and his proceedings &s;ucceeded, he afterwards received the public thanks.</P>
<P>In the year 1720, the plague was &s;u&s;pended at Mar&s;eilles by &s;imilar means for &s;ome weeks, and, no doubt, would have been entirely extingui&s;hed, if ca&s;es had not been permitted to multiply, owing to this deceitful pau&s;e, a circum&s;tance which gave occa&s;ion to the populace to treat the phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons with indignity, for creating what they &s;uppo&s;ed a fal&s;e alarm.&mdash;In con&s;equence of this
<PB N="16" REF="037274_0015_100CA4ED7037C000">
conduct the di&s;ea&s;e made too great progre&s;s to be afterwards &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude with ob&s;erving, that if any reliance is to be placed on pa&s;t events, unle&s;s you adopt the mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures for prevent|ing it, the di&s;ea&s;e will revive, and compel the citizens to con&s;ult their &s;afety in flight; an event &s;o ruin|ous to the intere&s;t and pro&s;perity of the city, that it requires no great &s;agacity to fore&s;ee its final de|population, as the inhabitants cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;up|port &s;uch &s;acrifices many years, as they have been forced to make of late. On your management and exertions, therefore, we rely, under Providence, for our pre&s;ervation from &s;o deplorable an event; and I tru&s;t we &s;hall not be di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t and deep concern I take, in com|mon with your&s;elves, in the welfare of our fellow-citizens, I hope, will apologize for the intru&s;ion and trouble which has now, as well as heretofore, been given you, by</P>

<P>Your friendly communication under date of the 6th in&s;t. is at hand. We are happy in having an opportunity of contradicting the injurious reports regarding the health of this city: reports which fear has indu&s;triou&s;ly diffu&s;ed and greatly magnifi|ed.

Per&s;ons who had no acquaintance or connexion with each other; each of who&s;e indi&s;po&s;ition can be attributed to di&s;tinct and different cau&s;es &s;ufficient to have produced that effect; cau&s;es which would have operated &s;imilarly in every country and &s;ituation equally warm. Their families, nur&s;es, and attend|ants continue well, neither has any new ca&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s occurred in the neighbourhood for ten days pa&s;t, from which circum&s;tances the alarm has en|tirely &s;ub&s;ided.</P>

<P>Examples in other countries of the influence of local and commercial intere&s;t over official duty, are common. No one is willing to believe the de&s;troyer is at work, le&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended and the intere&s;t of the city &s;uffer. Time and temper are wa&s;ted on the que&s;tion, <Q>how and whence does it come?</Q> Every one endeavours to per&s;uade him&s;elf and his neighbour that it is not come, till he di&s;covers it at his own door. Every one is of|fended with him who pronounces the di&s;agreeable truth. Circum&s;tances are &s;ifted, and the fir&s;t vic|tims to the dreaded di&s;ea&s;e are proclaimed to have peri&s;hed by other di&s;orders. The phy&s;icians are looked at with impatience and re&s;entment, and though they are in no danger of being torn to pieces in this country by the populace, as they were in Mo&s;cow in the year 1771, for telling them the plague had got among them, it was propo&s;ed to drive them out of the city, or to throw them into the river, not by the populace, but by certain popular characters po&s;&s;e&s;t of more zeal than know|ledge.</P>

The prize &s;loop already mentioned, was ordered by the Board of Health to the quarantine ground, and fell down on the 29th of June as far as South-&s;treet, where &s;he remained till the 1&s;t of July. She then hauled out and proceeded to her place of de&s;tination.</P>
<P>The fever had been dreadfully mortal at the Havanna, before its appearance in Philadelphia, as appears from the letter of Mr. Iznardi, Con&s;ul for the United States at that port, publi&s;hed in &s;everal of the news-papers.</P>
<P>The Amiable-Creole from Havanna, lay in the neighbourhood where the fever commenced, as well as the prize &s;loop already referred to. Goods from the &s;ame &s;ickly port were al&s;o frequently landed at the &s;ame place, by the lighters already mentioned.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o notorious, that the quarantine was re|peatedly violated, by per&s;ons coming up from ve&s;|&s;els under quarantine in the night, and returning on board before morning. Seven per&s;ons from the city, at a later period, were detected going to the ve&s;&s;els, and were confined fifteen days on State i&s;land by the Board of Health. Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es of this nature might be prevented by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a night watch. I have been a&s;&s;ured by a wharf builder of re&s;pectability, that the ma&s;ter of a ve&s;|&s;el

<P>A li&s;t of the deaths in the city and liberties was publi&s;hed in one of the papers the 10th of July, from which it appears, that the average number had been for &s;ome time about &s;ix a day.</P>
<P>About the 12th of July a few fre&s;h ca&s;es oc|curred in Penn, Little Water, Queen-&s;treet, and in the neighbourhood of the &s;till-hou&s;e wharf. The alarm which had nearly &s;ub&s;ided began to revive again. The Board of Health, in con&s;equence of this fre&s;h alarm, wrote to the phy&s;icians, reque&s;t|ing a return of all the ca&s;es under their care.</P>
<P>On the 15th of July, Harden a Stevedore and a man of the name of Pineyard were known to be dangerou&s;ly ill in different families in Queen near Water-&s;treet; Mrs. Arnold and Mr. Ro&s;s's daugh|ter, in Penn-&s;treet; Mr. Lawrence, a cooper, bro|ther to the gauger, in Water above Market-&s;treet; and Banner Thomas, in Front below Chri&s;tian-&s;treet, dangerou&s;ly ill. A fre&s;h ca&s;e of fever oc|curred the 17th, at the corner of Queen and Wa|ter-&s;treets. From this time very few fre&s;h ca&s;es were ob&s;erved till the 22d; on this day a lad that lived at Downs's, who had died &s;ome days before, in Little Water-&s;treet ea&s;t of Penn-&s;treet, was taken ill.</P>

There were nineteen funerals in the city and liberties on the 17th, including two from accidents, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> eight adults and eleven children. From the 17th to the 23d of the month, &s;everal per&s;ons were attacked in the neighbourhood of Front, Lombard and Penn-&s;treets, in the families of Mr. Bridges, Mrs. Woods, Mr. Blacki&s;on and Mr. Thomas. Several per&s;ons were attacked in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, at &s;ufficiently long intervals to ju&s;tify a con|clu&s;ion that the di&s;ea&s;e was contagious, e&s;pecially as &s;everal other families in the &s;ame neighbourhood were entirely exempt, which would not have been probable if the di&s;ea&s;e had ari&s;en from noxious ex|halations floating in the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>A lady moved from Penn-&s;treet to Wilmington early in July, and died there of the fever, but did not communicate the di&s;ea&s;e to any other per&s;on.</P>

For the letter of the Board of Health of Phila|delphia to that of Bo&s;ton, complaining of their &s;ubjecting the ve&s;&s;els from Philadelphia to quaran|tine, and their denial of the exi&s;tence of a conta|gious di&s;ea&s;e in Philadelphia, I refer to the True American of the 2d of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>I have received a&s;&s;urances from a re&s;pectable phy&s;ician in New-York, that he is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of unque&s;tionable evidences of the importation of the fever into that city in the month of July, by the &s;hip Gen. Wayne, from St. Domingo.</P>
<P>The number of ca&s;es had &s;o greatly dimini&s;hed in Philadelphia by the beginning of Augu&s;t, that at a meeting of the College of Phy&s;icians on the 6th, only four confirmed ca&s;es were known to ex|i&s;t in the city and liberties, and very few di&s;ea&s;es of any other de&s;cription.</P>
<P>A Newbury-Port paper of the 26th of July &s;tates, that the fever at that time prevalent there, was believed to have been imported by the &s;chooner Sally from St. Thomas's, which arrived there the 27th of June, as no per&s;on had been attacked with the fever who had not been on board that ve&s;&s;el, or that did not re&s;ide or vi&s;it in the vicinity of the lower long wharf, where the ve&s;&s;el was unladen. It is al&s;o a&s;&s;erted, that no ca&s;e of &s;uch a fever had occurred, until five or &s;ix days after the arrival of
<PB N="23" REF="037274_0022_100CA4FBD1F2AE48">
the Sally, excepting that of a lad who came from &s;ea in her: &s;oon after which, eleven per&s;ons died in that town; two in Sal&s;bury, and one in Newbu|ry, who had worked on board of her.</P>
<P>The above account is confirmed by Dr. James Tytler, in a treati&s;e lately publi&s;hed at Salem in New England, who adds, at page 535&mdash;"that of 30 per&s;ons taken with the fever, in the neighbour|hood of the wharf where the Sally lay, 16 died, the majority within the period of &s;even days."</P>
<P>The fever in Philadelphia increa&s;ed &s;o &s;en&s;ibly after the middle of Augu&s;t, that the College of Phy&s;icians had a &s;pecial meeting on the 21&s;t and made the following laconic communication to the Board of Health.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The College of Phy&s;icians conceive it to be their duty to inform you, that recent events have confirmed the opinion which they lately expre&s;&s;ed to your board; and they feel it incumbent on them to repeat, that a malignant contagious fever, of the &s;ame nature with the di&s;ea&s;e which raged here in the years 1793, 1797 and 1798, prevails among&s;t us at this time to a very alarming degree.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="24" REF="037274_0023_100CA4FD5899ED88">
This communication appeared in &s;everal of the news-papers, a day or two after it was &s;ent to the Board. Con&s;ternation &s;eized every one that heard of it; and every part where the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;u&s;pect|ed to exi&s;t, was in&s;tantly de&s;erted. Notwith&s;tand|ing all this, the Board of Health, governed by po|licy that I do not under&s;tand, or mi&s;led by &s;pecula|tive and mi&s;taken notions re&s;pecting the nature and cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, did not publicly acknowledge its exi&s;tence, much le&s;s that it was making progre&s;s, which was now no longer in their power to con|troul, till the 22d of Augu&s;t. They then, with evident reluctance, acknowledged that a number of per&s;ons had been taken ill the la&s;t &s;ix days, princi|pally in the lower part of the city and in South|wark, &s;ome of whom had died after a few days &s;ickne&s;s; but that from the few ca&s;es of mortality, and from the favourable change which had taken place in the weather, they were in hopes that a check would be given to its progre&s;s; and there|fore "they did not think there was &s;ufficient ground for the great alarm which pervaded the city."</P>
<P>The citizens convinced of their danger, from the frequent appearance of the her&s;e and the &s;ick coach, put no confidence in the declaration of the Board, but fled to the country in every direction and from every quarter; &s;o that by the 1&s;t of September a great part of the city, as well as Southwark, was
<PB N="25" REF="037274_0024_100CA50098522A70">
almo&s;t de&s;titute of inhabitants. Many, however, who had no places provided to retreat to, were forced to remain: and many fell victims to the di&s;ea&s;e, who might have e&s;caped if the &s;ignal of danger had been given earlier; and particularly if the line of communication had been cut off early between the infected and the other parts of the city, by removing both the di&s;ea&s;ed and the &s;ound from that part to a &s;afe di&s;tance in the country.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e gradually extended to almo&s;t every part of the city ea&s;t of Seventh-&s;treet; but very few ca&s;es occurred we&s;tward farther than that &s;treet, and not one either on Schuylkill or in Ken&s;|ington, as far as I can learn.</P>
<P>A few nights of &s;evere fro&s;t after the middle of October, deprived the contagion of its power, and put a period to the di&s;ea&s;e &s;o completely, that the greate&s;t part of the citizens returned to their wel|come homes before the end of the month.</P>
<P>The Board did not begin to publi&s;h the daily return of deaths in the city and liberties till the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t. From this time to the 18th of October, when they de&s;i&s;ted from publi&s;hing them, the number of deaths amounted to 720, including tho&s;e that died at the City ho&s;pital. I believe it may be &s;afely computed, that the number of deaths in the city and liberties from the 21&s;t of June to
<PB N="26" REF="037274_0025_100CA5022036C3E0">
the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t, on an average, did not ex|ceed 10 a day, including yellow fever ca&s;es, which is le&s;s than has occurred many years when no yel|low fever prevails; for that period is the mo&s;t in|&s;alubrious part of the year to infants and young children in Philadelphia, as September and Octo|ber have always been to adults.</P>
<P>According to the return made by the Board of Health to the Governor, the interments from the 10th of July to the la&s;t of October did not exceed 1276. During the la&s;t mentioned period, 324 pa|tients were received into the City ho&s;pital; of the&s;e 193 died.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The number of patients with the yellow fever admitted into the Lazaretto or Marine ho&s;pital was 95, of whom 21 died.</NOTE> The remedies chiefly employed were blood-letting, and mercury, both internally, and externally, for the purpo&s;e of inducing &s;alivation as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>In the year 1793, 807 patients were received into Bu&s;h-Hill ho&s;pital (which is &s;ituated in a much more eligible and &s;alutary &s;ituation than the pre&s;ent ho&s;pital) from the 22d of September to the 6th of November; of the&s;e 448 died. The chief reme|dies employed in 1793, were, occa&s;ional but very &s;paring bleeding, mild laxatives, diluting drinks with vegetable acids, bli&s;ters and camphorated ni|trous powders, partial warm bath, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="037274_0026_100CA5042B15D4B8">
In 1797 I do not know the number admitted. Bleeding was &s;eldom employed; but mercury was employed in &s;mall and repeated do&s;es, for the pur|po&s;e of inducing &s;alivation. The proportion of deaths, however, was nearly equal to that of 1799.</P>
<P>In 1798, in addition to free blood-letting and the liberal u&s;e of mercury in recent ca&s;es, active emetics were frequently employed about the fourth day of the di&s;ea&s;e, for the purpo&s;e of "&s;haking the gall-bladder;" the quantity and vitiated qua|lity of the bile being at that time &s;uppo&s;ed, by &s;ome gentlemen, to be the principal cau&s;e which kept up the febrile &s;tate. The proportion of deaths however was greater in 1798, if my in|formation is correct, and I have made a careful inquiry, than in any of the other years that have been mentioned.</P>
<P>Some of the nur&s;es became &s;ick at the ho&s;pital in 1799, but were all well when the patients were di&s;charged, and the hou&s;e &s;hut up on the 2d of November. In the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, the alms-hou&s;e and Penn&s;ylvania ho&s;pital were &s;hut; in con&s;equence of which the poor, with di&s;ea&s;es of different kinds, were received for &s;ome time into the City ho&s;pital.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="037274_0027_100CA505B58FFD88">
Though the di&s;ea&s;e pervaded different parts of the city, in&s;omuch that it was judged hazardous to hold the election at the &s;tate-hou&s;e in Che&s;nut be|tween Fifth and Sixth-&s;treets, neither of the banks nor the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e were removed; and, though they were daily vi&s;ited, and bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;acted with them by gentlemen from the country, there was not an in&s;tance of any one taking the di&s;ea&s;e from that circum&s;tance that I have heard of: a proof that the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e was not diffu&s;ed through the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>No provi&s;ion having been made for the poor, they were reduced to a mo&s;t de&s;titute and fami&s;h|ing condition; in con&s;equence of which many were &s;ent to the ho&s;pital, as well as &s;everal orphan chil|dren. The compa&s;&s;ion of the guardians of the poor being rou&s;ed by the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances, they negociated a loan towards the end of Septem|ber, and appointed a committee of humane citizens (of which Dr. Samuel Powel Griffitts was one) to &s;upply them with nece&s;&s;aries.</P>

Wheeler was &s;ent with a fleet to invade and conquer Martinique, but his men were &s;eized with a malignant fever which de&s;troyed three-fourths of them; in con&s;equence of this the fleet &s;ailed to Bo&s;ton and introduced the di&s;ea&s;e into that town, where it occa&s;ioned dreadful mortality." From this account, however, it cannot be a&s;certained whether this was the yellow fever or the common putrid fever.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t appearance of the yellow fever in Bar|badoes, of which any account is recorded or handed down by popular tradition, was in the year 1691; at which time the Rev. Griffith Hughes (Nat.

Dr. Warren adds, "The fever had broke out, as he was informed by Mr. Nel&s;on and others, at Port St. Pierre, &s;oon after the arrival of a proven&ccedil;al fleet from Mar&s;eilles."</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="037274_0035_100CA516D74317E8">
"This di&s;temper," &s;ays Dr. Warren, "cannot be rea&s;onably attributed to any corruption of the air that ari&s;es from lakes, mar&s;hes or woods, be|cau&s;e the land in this i&s;land is the be&s;t cultivated, and entirely free from lakes or mar&s;hes, and, un|fortunately for the inhabitants, there is not a &s;uffi|ciency of wood on it for fuel; but it is agreeably diver&s;ified with hills and ri&s;ings, on the very tops of which the be&s;t canes grow. The air here is al|&s;o remarkably pure and fre&s;h, and probably more &s;alubrious than in any of the other &s;ugar colonies."</P>
<P>Before the introduction of the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t men|tioned by this author, into the i&s;land, he &s;ays he had for &s;even or eight years paid particular atten|tion to the effects produced on health by the dif|ferent &s;ea&s;ons and &s;tate of the weather; during which time &s;ome years had been di&s;tingui&s;hed for &s;ultry heats and long intolerable droughts, &s;ome by almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant rains, and &s;everal by un&s;ettled and tempe&s;tuous weather, and yet no foot&s;teps of this fever did appear in all that time. He has frequent|ly ob&s;erved, that a continuation of dry and hot weather has been &s;o far from giving any aggrava|tion to the contagion, that it has &s;eemed rather to repre&s;s it, till the returning rains and a moi&s;t at|mo&s;phere have renewed its activity.</P>
<P>Dr. Warren proceeds, "The reader may judge as he thinks fit of this account of the origin of this

di&s;ea&s;e. I am &s;atisfied that it was introduced among us the two la&s;t times in the manner de&s;cribed; and that it is not by any means the natural growth of this i&s;land, but truly a foreign intruder, let the fir&s;t cau&s;es of it be what or from whence they may."</P>
<P>This author a&s;&s;erts, that "intermitting fevers are rarely, if ever, the product of Barbadoes, let the weather vary ever &s;o much, though continued fevers upon their going off, &s;ometimes put on the appearance of intermittents, and per&s;ons with agues are often brought here from &s;ome of the other i&s;lands."</P>
<P>"In &s;ome of the other i&s;lands, where the har|bours are muddy and the adjacent ground low and wet, the <HI>natives</HI> as well as <HI>strangers,</HI> are in an emi|nent degree, &s;ubject to intermittents and remittents, re&s;embling double tertians, which are frequently ob&s;tinate and irregular, but which with due pre|paration and precautions &s;ubmit at length to the bark." In another place he &s;ays, "bark did no good in the malignant fever. And that the i&s;land had not been entirely exempt from the malignant fever from the year 1733 to 1739, the time his treati&s;e was written." And we know from the publications of Drs. Hume and Wright, that it proved de&s;tructive to the crews of Admiral Ver|non's fleet, in the year 1741.</P>

In a pamphlet, entitled, a Di&s;cour&s;e on the Plague, publi&s;hed in London, in the year 1721, it is related, that "a pe&s;tilential fever was introduced into Virginia in the year 1697, by Admiral Nevill's &s;quadron, which arrived there from the We&s;t Indies."</P>
<P>The fir&s;t occurrence of the yellow fever in Phila|delphia, of which there is any record, or recollec|tion, was in the year 1699.

<P>From an anecdote re&s;pecting Roger Gill, a noted preacher of the Friends &s;ociety (who prayed in public that he might be accepted as a &s;acrifice and the people &s;pared) it appears the fever at that time was mo&s;t general and mortal, the la&s;t week in September. And from the regi&s;ter of deaths kept by the meeting, it appears to have entirely cea&s;ed before the 1&s;t of November.

<P>A letter written by the late Dr. John Bard of New-York, and publi&s;hed in the American Mu&s;e|um for 1788, page 453, contains the following information on this &s;ubject, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>"I have heard from the ancient inhabitants of this city, that &s;o long ago as the year 1702, a malignant fever little inferior to a plague was im|ported into it, which, from its extreme mortality, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the Great Sick|ne&s;s; and that if tradition &s;ays true, was brought here from St. Thomas's, in a &s;ingle bale of cotton." That fatal di&s;temper, adds Dr. Bard, "called the yellow fever or black vomit, which, about 40 years ago produced its ravages in &s;everal parts of this continent, particularly in the cities of Philadelphia and New-York, was fir&s;t imported from the Spani&s;h Main into Barbadoes, and from that i&s;land in the

cour&s;e of commerce, communicated to this con|tinent.</P>
<P>"The cities of New-York and Philadelphia, have &s;everal times experienced the fatal effects of dangerous infections, &s;ome of them re&s;embling the jail fever, from dirty &s;hips, crowded with dirty pa&s;|&s;engers, from Rotterdam, which from that cau&s;e took the name of the palatine fever."</P>
<P>At that time there was no legal provi&s;ion again&s;t tho&s;e dangers: ve&s;&s;els with this load of impurity came immediately up to the wharves and the &s;ick were landed in the town. The legi&s;lature of New-York have &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed a law for preventing the in|troduction of di&s;ea&s;es into that city; but laws will be of no avail unle&s;s they are enforced with rigor and impartiality.</P>
<P>We are informed by Dr. Lind, in his 2d paper on infection, that he had received information from a gentleman in Philadelphia, who had been a &s;ufferer by the di&s;ea&s;e, "that the yellow fever was introduced into that city, in the year 1741, by means of a trunk of wearing apparel belonging to a gentleman who had died of the fever in Barba|does, and that it proved mortal to more than two hundred of the inhabitants."</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="037274_0043_100CA527F9D8B358">
Dr. Lining of Charle&s;ton, in a letter to Dr. Whytt, publi&s;hed in the 2d vol. of the Phy&s;ical and Literary E&s;&s;ays of Edinburgh, gives an ac|count of the occurrence of the yellow fever in that city, in the years 1732, 1739, 1745 and 1748, and a&s;&s;erts, "that it had been traced to &s;ome per&s;ons or ve&s;&s;el lately arrived from &s;ome of the We&s;t India i&s;lands, every time that it had occurred there." Dr. Lining al&s;o adds, "that &s;ome of the &s;ea&s;ons in which it had been epidemic or general were more cool and &s;alutary than many that had preceded or intervened, in which the di&s;ea&s;e had not appeared at all."</P>
<P>Dr. Mitchel of Virginia, in a letter to Dr. B. Franklin, informs him, "that a malignant contagi|ous fever, (which from his de&s;cription appears to have been the yellow fever) was prevalent in cer|tain parts of that &s;tate, in the years 1737 and 1741, and that it originated from an infection <HI>&s;ui generis,</HI> and had been twice brought into tho&s;e parts by &s;hips of war which &s;ailed in tho&s;e &s;eas."</P>
<P>From the year 1747, when it was again partially epidemic in Philadelphia and New-York, as appears from letters which have been pre&s;erved by &s;ome of their inhabitants, Philadelphia was exempt from it till the year 1762, when, according to the notes of Dr. Redman, pre&s;ident of the College of Phy&s;i|cians, which were communicated to the College in
<PB N="45" REF="037274_0044_100CA5298B4A5D98">
1793, it was imported from Havanna, and com|municated by a &s;ick &s;ailor to the family with whom he lodged near the New Market, in the lower end of the city, and from that family to others in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, till it pervaded nearly one half of the city, particularly that part below the great dock and ca|nal, which at that time was neither arched nor drained. It then cea&s;ed of a &s;udden, about the middle of October, and was no more heard of in any of the &s;tates, till the year 1793.</P>
<P>For an account of the prevalence of the di&s;ea&s;e in Philadelphia in the years 1793, 1797 and 1798, the reader is reque&s;ted to con&s;ult the late publica|tion of the College of Phy&s;icians, entitled, "Facts and Ob&s;ervations on the Origin and Nature of the Pe&s;tilential or Yellow Fever," &amp;c. in which he will find the importation of the di&s;ea&s;e proved by the mo&s;t po&s;itive and undeniable te&s;timony.</P>
<P>Dr. Mon&s;on, of New Haven, (a phy&s;ician of re|&s;pectability and eminence) in his printed account of the yellow fever which occurred in that town in June 1794, and became epidemic, relates, "that Captain Truman arrived there early in June from Martinique, in a &s;loop that was infected with the contagion of the yellow fever, and laid at a wharf within a few rods of I&s;aac Gorham's hou&s;e; and that a che&s;t of wearing apparel, belonging to a man who had died on board the ve&s;&s;el at Marti|nique,
<PB N="46" REF="037274_0045_100CA52CA0F2D468">
was carried from the ve&s;&s;el to Mr. Au&s;tin's &s;tore, and opened in the pre&s;ence of Captain Tru|man, Mr. Au&s;tin, Henry Hubbard and Polly Gor|ham, the three la&s;t of whom were infected and died in a few days after their expo&s;ure to the contents of the che&s;t. No per&s;on in the town was known to have had the yellow fever previous to the arrival of Captain Truman's ve&s;&s;el." Dr. Mon&s;on a&s;&s;erts, "he could trace every ca&s;e that occurred to conta|gion; and that, of 64 patients which was the number that died of this di&s;ea&s;e, 44 had black vo|miting." <HI>See Webster's Collection.</HI></P>
<P>In a &s;ub&s;equent letter, Dr. Mon&s;on &s;ays, he was for a con&s;iderable time at a lo&s;s to account for the ca&s;e of a child who took the di&s;ea&s;e, as it could not be di&s;covered that it had been expo&s;ed to any &s;ource of contagion. But a man, after the termi|nation of the di&s;ea&s;e, who had been employed as a nur&s;e to tho&s;e in the fever, informed the family that he had taken it up in the &s;treet and carried it into the hou&s;e, to prevent it from being hurt, un|perceived by any of the family.</P>
<P>By what means the di&s;ea&s;e was introduced into Baltimore in the year 1794, or into Norfolk in the year 1795, I have not been able to collect po&s;itive proofs; but from its fir&s;t appearance at Fell's point, where the &s;hipping lay, and from its gradual progre&s;s into other parts of the town, there is a
<PB N="47" REF="037274_0046_100CA52E2952BC40">
&s;trong pre&s;umption it was introduced into Balti|more by one or more infected ve&s;&s;els from the We&s;t Indies where it had become before that time almo&s;t univer&s;al.</P>
<P>The proofs of the introduction of the yellow fever into New-York in the year 1795, by the brig Zephyr, from Port-au-Prince, publi&s;hed by the Board of Health of that city, though controverted by &s;ome of the medical gentlemen of that place, are &s;ufficiently authentic and valid to convince any impartial and di&s;intere&s;ted inquirer, that it was im|ported that <HI>year into New-York by that ve&s;&s;el.</HI> Tho&s;e proofs may be &s;een in the Philadelphia Gazette, dated September 24th, 1795.</P>
<P>In the year 1796 it appeared and became epi|demic in Bo&s;ton, and in the town of Chatham on Connecticut river. From whence it originated in Bo&s;ton has never yet been a&s;certained; but we are informed by Mr. Web&s;ter in his Hi&s;tory of Epi|demic and Pe&s;tilential Di&s;ea&s;es, vol. ii. p. 344, after returning from his re&s;earches among revolv|ing planets, blazing comets, exploding volcanoes and wide-yawning earthquakes, to &s;olid ground; "that the fever at Chatham was traced, in every in&s;tance, to a ve&s;&s;el from a port in Hi&s;paniola, which was highly infected; and that no per&s;on was affected without direct intercour&s;e with the ve&s;&s;el, the clothing or the &s;ick. It was not taken

by pa&s;&s;ing along the &s;treet, nor from hou&s;e to hou&s;e. It commenced late in September and had no precur&s;ors."</P>
<P>Dr. Mon&s;on, in a letter to Dr. Ho&s;ack of New-York, a&s;&s;erts, "that the yellow fever was not only decidedly and clearly traced to importation at Had|dam in 1796, but al&s;o at Newbury-Port in 1797; in the latter place by a ve&s;&s;el which arrived there in the month of May, from one of the ports of the We&s;t Indies, on board of which one or more per&s;ons had died on her homeward pa&s;&s;age."

<P>The following, among other circum&s;tances, prove that the fever was imported into Philadelphia in the year 1798.

To op|po&s;e fanciful &s;peculations and arguments drawn from remote analogies, to facts &s;o clearly and fairly e&s;tabli&s;hed as the&s;e, is not only trifling with our under&s;tandings, but is an outrage upon common &s;en&s;e; and as &s;uch fanciful &s;peculations have a tendency to &s;upport and perpetuate di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and unavailing apprehen&s;ions, and to affect the pro&s;|perity of all the commercial towns in the union, it is a grievance that demands the interference of the federal legi&s;lature.</P>

<P>Dr. Brackett of Port&s;mouth (N.

To the facts which have now been &s;tated re&s;pect|ing the importation of the yellow fever into this country, and con&s;equently of its being a contagious di&s;ea&s;e, under certain circum&s;tances, I &s;hall only add one more, lately furni&s;hed by Dr. Bayley, phy&s;ician and in&s;pector of ve&s;&s;els for the port of New York. In a letter from Dr. Bayley to the mayor of New York, publi&s;hed in different papers, it is &s;tated, "that the &s;hip General Wayne &s;ailed from New York on the 14th of April for Havanna, navigated by 25 men under the command of John Seaman. On the 25th of May, whil&s;t lying in the harbour of Havanna, John Brown a &s;ailor died, and John John|&s;on the 1&s;t of June. During the pa&s;&s;age of the &s;hip to the port of New York, Jonas Willis &s;ickened, and died on the 14th of June.

On the evening of the 27th of June, Mr. John Wright, a pa&s;&s;enger on board the Gen. Wayne, was attacked with the fever, and received into the ho&s;pital on the morning of the 28th.

of wa&s;hing and &s;crubbing the decks and ven|tilating the hold, without unlading or &s;hifting the cargo, this ve&s;&s;el proceeded to New York, and came along&s;ide of Coentie's &s;lip. Soon after her arrival, &s;everal ca&s;es of yellow fever occurred in the neighbourhood of that wharf which was perfectly healthy before her arrival. This circum&s;tance con|firming the declaration of Capt. Seaman, the ma&s;|ter of the Gen. Wayne, that &s;he was an infected ve&s;&s;el, which has been &s;tated by Mr. Watkins, one of the owners, in the New York Gazette, exa&s;|perated the inhabitants of that neighbourhood to &s;uch a degree that they compelled her removal.</P>

<P>It is a&s;&s;erted by A&s;truc on Pe&s;tilential Di&s;ea&s;es; by Sauvages in his No&s;ologia Methodica; by De&s;|portes and Dazille, both of whom were phy&s;icians of eminence in St. Domingo; and by Mr. Moreau de St. Mery, in his Hi&s;tory of the French Part of St. Domingo, page 700, "that the yellow fever was not known in the We&s;t Indies till the year 1689, when it was imported into Martinico by a fleet from Siam in the Ea&s;t Indies, hence called the Maladie de Siam.

to the harbours and &s;eaports in the year 1782, that very few medical gentlemen who re&s;ided in the country had ever &s;een a ca&s;e of it. This circum|&s;tance and other facts contained in Blane's work formerly deceived me &s;o much, that I thought the yellow fever was only a modification of the typhus gravior, or the common malignant fever of &s;hips, &amp;c. but recent ob&s;ervations and more accurate inquiries have convinced me that the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> are not the &s;ame; for the contagion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> in winter within a certain di&s;tance <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> di&s;ea&s;ed, where the air is not frequently renewed, as well or perhaps more certainly than in &s;ummer; where|as the operation of the contagion of the latter is confined chiefly to the latter end of &s;um|mer and to autumn. From the ce&s;&s;ation of the revolutionary war in America in 1783 to the year 1793, there were no traces of the di&s;ea&s;e in either Granada, St. Domingo or Barbadoes; and I have met with no author that has made mention of it in any other of the i&s;lands between the periods ju&s;t mentioned; if there has, I &s;hall be thankful for correction, for my &s;ole aim in this account is to &s;eparate truth from error. But early in the year 1793 it made its appearance in the town of St. George, &s;oon after the arrival of the &s;hip Hankey, with a &s;ickly crew from the coa&s;t of Guinea; which was on the 17th of February. This fact is e&s;tab|li&s;hed not only on the re&s;pectable te&s;timony of Drs. Chi&s;holm and Wright, but by the public

<P>From Grenada the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;peedily convey|ed to &s;everal of the other We&s;t India i&s;lands in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, particularly to Tobago, St. Domingo, Guadaloupe, St. Vincents, Antigua, Dominique, Jamaica and Barbadoes; and &s;ince to Cuba, &amp;c. According to Dr. Clark, it did not reach Domi|nica till the 12th of June, which was &s;oon after the arrival of a number of refugees from St. Do|mingo; a great portion of whom, contrary to what happened in Philadelphia, were the fir&s;t affected and the greate&s;t &s;ufferers.

<P>In Barbadoes it mu&s;t have been communicated by contagion, and could not have originated there, as there are no &s;ources of intermittents or remit|tents of the milde&s;t form in the whole i&s;land, at lea&s;t not &s;ufficient to render the di&s;ea&s;e general.&mdash;See Hugh's Natural Hi&s;tory of the i&s;land publi&s;h|ed in the year 1750.&mdash;Even Antigua which is not only free from mar&s;hes, but has neither &s;pring nor rivulet on the whole i&s;land, has not e&s;caped this ferocious and de&s;tructive di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

The immen&s;e commerce of the United States, and the &s;hortne&s;s of the voyage, render the We&s;t Indies to them the &s;ame &s;ource of contagion that the Levant is to Europe.</P>
<P>During the exi&s;ting war, though the yellow fe|ver has &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pervaded almo&s;t all the i&s;lands, it has been mo&s;t &s;everely felt in the French i&s;lands Guadaloupe and St. Domingo, which have been the principal &s;cenes of military operations. With tho&s;e i&s;lands the American commerce has been car|ried on to a greater extent than with any of the others; and as the American ve&s;&s;els nece&s;&s;arily have had frequent communication with the fleets in the ports of tho&s;e i&s;lands, they could not avoid being infected. When the infected ve&s;&s;els return|ed home early in the &s;pring or &s;ummer, or late in the fall, the temperature of the air not being fa|vourable to retain or convey the matter of conta|gion, no di&s;ea&s;e or only a few &s;olitary ca&s;es have been the con&s;equence. The rea&s;on that the di&s;ea&s;e occurs more commonly about the end of July or beginning of Augu&s;t, in the United States (though there are many exceptions to this fact, for it has &s;ometimes occurred in the month of May) is be|cau&s;e it is more generally epidemic in the We&s;t In|dia i&s;lands in that &s;ea&s;on, as we learn from &s;everal writers of credit, than at any other time of the year, which is the mo&s;t rainy &s;ea&s;on within the tropics.</P>

<P>If the yellow fever, with its dreadful train of malignity and almo&s;t re&s;i&s;tle&s;s violence, was only a higher grade of the common remitting fever, and originated from the &s;ame cau&s;es, it has been a&s;ked, How came it all at once to a&s;&s;ume &s;uch a new and terrific form, as there is no example of &s;uch a &s;ud|den

<P>To extricate them&s;elves from the dilemma in which they are involved by this que&s;tion, the &s;up|porters of the dome&s;tic origin of the yellow fever have recour&s;e to an imaginary change in the con&s;ti|tution of the atmo&s;phere, which they &s;ay has taken place of late years, and has become inflammatory: and, that this inflammatory con&s;titution of the at|mo&s;phere, in conjunction with putrid exhalations, which before this change of con&s;titution took place occa&s;ioned only fevers of a &s;imple and mild kind in this country, now gives origin to the malignant and de&s;tructive yellow fever. In &s;upport of this doc|trine, its advocates appeal to the &s;ea&s;on of the year when the di&s;ea&s;e begins, progre&s;&s;es and terminates; and to the more &s;peedy ripening and decay of fruit, increa&s;e of in&s;ects, &amp;c. than formerly: and, no doubt, they would have con&s;idered the He&s;&s;ian fly as an unan&s;werable argument in favour of their opinion, if, unfortunately, it had not appeared too early for their purpo&s;e.&mdash;Mr. Web&s;ter, with equal rea&s;on, con&s;iders the death of oy&s;ters and large draughts of &s;had, as links of the &s;ame chain of cau&s;es which produce earthquakes and yellow fe|ver! But it &s;urely requires &s;omething more &s;ub|&s;tantial, to e&s;tabli&s;h a doctrine fraught with &s;uch &s;erious con&s;equences to the welfare and intere&s;t of the community, than the mere &s;ugge&s;tions of fancy:
<PB N="68" REF="037274_0067_100CA558EA69F4B8">
And till tho&s;e gentlemen &s;ubject the atmo&s;phere to eudiometrical experiments, and demon&s;trate that &s;uch a con&s;titution does exi&s;t, or that &s;ome material change has taken place, it cannot with ju&s;tice or &s;afety be con&s;idered as any thing more than the mere &s;ugge&s;tions of fancy, and de&s;erves no more re&s;pect than the vi&s;ionary opinions which prevailed in the dark ages of Gothic ignorance, when the conjunction or oppo&s;ition of certain planets were believed to be the cau&s;e of the plague.</P>
<P>The following lines of Fraca&s;toricus, who pub|li&s;hed his ob&s;ervations about the middle of the 16th century, give &s;ome idea of this doctrine:

<P>3d. Becau&s;e a greater proportion of the oxygene air, or inflammatory principle, exi&s;ts in the winter, &s;pring and early part of the &s;ummer, than during the remainder of the year, as &s;eems to be rendered probable, by the brighter, and more florid com|plexions

<P>4th. Becau&s;e if it was owing to an increa&s;ed proportion of oxygenous air or an inflammatory con&s;titution, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould appear among the inhabitants in the country, more readily than in the air of cities.</P>
<P>The late experiments of Dr. Carmichael Smyth, al&s;o appear to militate again&s;t this opinion. The fumes produced according to his directions to de|&s;troy contagion, con&s;i&s;t, as Mr. Keir a&s;&s;erts, of highly oxygenated nitrous vapour, mixed with a large quantity of oxygenous or pure air.</P>
<P>It is a maxim in philo&s;ophy, not to admit any thing for the cau&s;e of an effect that is not &s;up|ported by accurate and repeated ob&s;ervations or direct experiments. Therefore, till more &s;ub&s;tantial proofs than arbitrary a&s;&s;ertions or ingenious con|jectures, are offered in &s;upport of this doctrine, it ought neither to be adopted nor re&s;pected.</P>
<P>Equally powerful objections apply to the doc|trine of gazeous oxyd of azote.</P>

&s;till more exceptionable, and to be as much the creature of imagination as the tales of the fairies.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen, confounding contagion which ari&s;es occa&s;ionally in certain climates and &s;ituations, with that which is permanent and always exi&s;ting, have hazarded and a&s;&s;ertion, in contradiction to re|ceived opinion and common ob&s;ervation, that the yellow fever is not contagious. This doctrine, if erroneous, would be attended with &s;uch &s;erious con&s;equences, that nothing but the mo&s;t po&s;itive and unambiguous proofs &s;hould induce any one to give credit to it. For though many inconveniencies and evils ari&s;e from the dread of contagion when it does not exi&s;t, there has been no truth more clearly proved, than that &s;till greater inconveniencies and injuries are the con&s;equence of believing there is no danger in vi&s;iting and attending the &s;ick, when the di&s;ea&s;e is contagious. Surely, therefore, before the adoption of an opinion which, if fal&s;e, would be attended with &s;uch &s;erious and fatal con&s;e|quences, the mo&s;t indi&s;putable proofs &s;hould be exhibited.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the difficulties which attend all inquiries into the nature and properties of conta|gion, and the influence of various cau&s;es on its ope|ration, there are but few &s;ubjects on which people in general are &s;o well agreed.

<PB N="72" REF="037274_0071_100CA56146601868">
in&s;tead of the fallacious pictures of their imagina|tions, many countries and cities would have e&s;caped the dreadful &s;courge of the plague, the contagious nature of which, as well as that of the yellow fe|ver, has been openly denied by men who have roved among the planets in &s;earch of cau&s;es, in&s;tead of at|tending to the phenomena and occurrences before their eyes.&mdash;The rea&s;ons mo&s;t commonly advanced in &s;upport of this extraordinary opinion, were, becau&s;e many of the attendants on the &s;ick were not affect|ed, becau&s;e its progre&s;s was fluctuating, and it was mo&s;t prevalent and mortal among the poore&s;t cla&s;&s;|es, and might be owing to poverty, unfound food, unwhole&s;ome water, and many other &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;es. That this mi&s;take was eventually the oc|ca&s;ion of the mo&s;t dreadful calamities, is well known to tho&s;e who have read the hi&s;tory of the plagues which have been imported from the Levant, at different times, into the cities of Europe. Similar opinions have of late been attempted to be revived in this country; but I hope the recent experience, and the good &s;en&s;e of the people, will pre&s;erve them from adopting &s;o erroneous and mi&s;chievous a doc|trine, which has a tendency to relax the vigilance of tho&s;e &s;tationed at the po&s;t of danger.</P>
<P>It is a fact well known to tho&s;e who have had the charge of pri&s;on-&s;hips or tran&s;ports crouded with men, that it is not only from a direct com|munication with the &s;ick that contagious fevers are
<PB N="73" REF="037274_0072_100CA5634E2FD218">
occa&s;ioned and propagated, but from the per&s;ons and clothes of tho&s;e that have lately been &s;ick, or that have even remained long in an infected atmo&s;phere; that is, in that portion of the atmo&s;phere that &s;ur|rounds the &s;ick, which being received into woollen, cotton, &s;ilk, and many other porous materials, not excepting timber and furniture, are capable, after having been conveyed a great di&s;tance and pre&s;erved a great length of time in &s;ituations excluded from fre&s;h air, of producing the &s;ame effect as an immedi|ate communication with the &s;ick them&s;elves: of this fact, the examples on record are &s;o numerous as to put the matter beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt. It has al&s;o been ob&s;erved by &s;everal late writers of di&s;tingui&s;hed talents and information, that the mo&s;t highly contagious fevers, in clear and well venti|lated ho&s;pitals, do not in general affect the patients lodged in the &s;ame ward, but the nur&s;es only, and tho&s;e patients or other per&s;ons that a&s;&s;i&s;t them in taking them out or putting them into bed, or tho&s;e that lie in the beds contiguous to, or very near them. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation applies to private families in large, clean and ventilated apartments; for there it is rare for any per&s;ons but tho&s;e who are under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;leeping in the chamber, or of approaching &s;o near the &s;ick as to be &s;en&s;ible of the warmth or exhalations from his body, to be infected, e&s;pecially if they guard again&s;t &s;tand|ing oppo&s;ite to the cour&s;e of the wind when the windows are open; for the matter of contagion,

like noxious ga&s;es, only operates injuriou&s;ly when concentrated and unmixed with pure air, and is harmle&s;s when diffu&s;ed in the unconfined atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>The ingenious Dr. Hunter, who had charge of the military ho&s;pitals in Jamaica in the years 1781, 1782, and 1783, remarks that the typhus gravior<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The common contagious continued fever of camps, ho&s;pitals and pri&s;on &s;hips, &amp;c.</NOTE> (which is known to be contagious in temperate cli|mates in all clo&s;e, unventilated and uncleanly &s;itua|tions, crowded with people) was never contagious in the ho&s;pitals of Jamaica, though they were fre|quently crowded with patients with di&s;ea&s;es of dif|ferent de&s;criptions. Dr. Lind informs us, that this fever, &s;o extremely contagious on board &s;hips, was &s;eldom contagious in the clean and airy ho&s;pital of Ha&s;lar in England.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e authors, as well as the unrivalled Cul|len, are decidedly of opinion, that the contagion of fever received and retained in the wearing ap|parel and bedding of the di&s;ea&s;ed, is the mo&s;t dangerous mode in which it can be communicated, and is much more certain in producing fever than when it fir&s;t i&s;&s;ues from the body of the patient. In &s;upport of this opinion, Dr. Lind appeals to the circum&s;tance of the naked &s;laves from Africa e&s;caping, while the convicts &s;ent to America with dirty foul clothing, generally &s;uffer by it during
<PB N="75" REF="037274_0074_100CA56811043768">
their voyage, though much le&s;s crowded than the unfortunate &s;laves. It is al&s;o well known to tho&s;e acquainted with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of medical know|ledge, or that have been employed in military ho&s;pitals or pri&s;on &s;hips, that the fever which originates in confined and foul &s;ituations crowded with people, is of a continued form, and is con|tagious in winter as well as at other &s;ea&s;ons of the year; which we now know is not the ca&s;e in tem|perate climates with either the plague or the yel|low fever, both of which prevail or become epide|mic only in the latter part of &s;ummer and during the autumnal &s;ea&s;on; and which have &s;o many &s;ymptoms in common, and have their principal &s;eats in the &s;ame parts of the &s;y&s;tem, as di&s;&s;ections demon&s;trate, that if there is any dependence on analogy, they originate from the &s;ame cau&s;e and are only different degrees of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, varied in &s;ome re&s;pects by difference of climate.</P>
<P>We now know from repeated ob&s;ervations, that the contagion of the yellow fever, like that of the pe&s;tilence, requires a certain range of temperature, as well as a calm or &s;tagnant condition of it, to enable it to operate injuriou&s;ly on the principle of life. When the temperature of the atmo&s;|phere is above 80, the contagion is volatilized and di&s;&s;ipated: when as low as the freezing point, the caloric or matter of heat by which it is render|ed volatile and active is detached, and it falls harm|le&s;s
<PB N="76" REF="037274_0075_100CA569988851B8">
to the ground.&mdash;This is illu&s;trated by the poi|&s;onous juice of the We&s;t India ca&s;hu nut, which in a certain temperature ri&s;es into the atmo&s;phere; and, though imperceptible to the &s;en&s;es, when it comes in contact with a tender part of the &s;urface of the body where the cuticle is thin, it occa&s;ions a burning &s;en&s;ation and a painful eruption, which &s;ometimes excites a con&s;iderable degree of fever.</P>
<P>I apprehend I have now proved the yellow fever to be a contagious and imported di&s;ea&s;e, by te&s;timo|ny that can neither be denied nor invalidated, and con&s;equently that the doctrine of its dome&s;tic ori|gin is palpably erroneous. This is a fact of great importance to the true intere&s;t of this country; for if the erroneous doctrine of the dome&s;tic origin of the di&s;ea&s;e was generally believed, foreign com|merce would &s;hun our dangerous ports, and the ve&s;&s;els of our merchants would be &s;ubjected to the inconvenience and vexation of a tedious and ex|pen&s;ive quarantine in foreign ports. This has al|ready been propo&s;ed at Mar&s;eilles, as appears from a pamphlet received from thence by the &s;ecretary of &s;tate. The indu&s;trious cla&s;&s;es of our citizens, &s;ore vexed by cheerle&s;s poverty, would &s;eek &s;ome &s;afer and more favourable &s;ituation, and the &s;tately edifices of our cities them&s;elves would &s;oon crumble into ruins:&mdash;for few that de&s;erve the name of ra|tional beings, would be found &s;o prodigal of health and life, however powerful their love of gain, as to
<PB N="77" REF="037274_0076_100CA56BD0ECB3E0">
immigrate to, or venture to re&s;ide in the &s;eat of pe&s;tilence and death.</P>
<P>The arguments of tho&s;e gentlemen who contend, that the belief in the doctrine of the dome&s;tic ori|gin of the di&s;ea&s;e would promote the intere&s;t of this country, re&s;emble the arguments of the athe|i&s;ts, who maintain that the cau&s;e of morality would be promoted by the belief that there is no future &s;tate of accountability; a belief that would take off all re&s;traint from triumphant vice, and all con|&s;olation from &s;uffering virtue.</P>
<P>My ob&s;ervations however incline me to believe, that although the yellow fever is never generated in this country, it is communicated from one to another more readily and certainly when the at|mo&s;phere is replete with putrid exhalations, than when it is more pure or free from &s;uch exhala|tions. Prudence, therefore, dictates the propriety of removing from the city and its vicinity all putre|fiable &s;ub&s;tances, and to promote coolne&s;s and ven|tilation during the hot &s;ea&s;on, as far as practicable; at the &s;ame time, I think our main force &s;hould be directed with energy and ince&s;&s;ant vigilance to the &s;ource of importation; convinced, if that po&s;t was faithfully and effectually guarded, our health would not be endangered nor our intere&s;t and pro&s;perity bla&s;ted by the di&s;a&s;trous calamity of the yellow fever.</P>

<HEAD>A Review of the Different Methods of Treating the Yellow Fever.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the publication of Dr. Chi&s;holm on the pe&s;tilential fever which appeared in Grenada in the years 1793 and 1794, in which he recom|mends producing a &s;alivation as early as po&s;&s;ible by means of mercury, as the mo&s;t effectual and certain method of curing the di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;ame method has been adopted by the majority of the phy&s;icians of America: and its &s;uppo&s;ed good ef|fects have been accounted for, upon the fanciful principle, fir&s;t taught by Sir John Hunter, of cur|ing one di&s;ea&s;e by creating another. But if my ob&s;ervations have not greatly deceived me, mer|cury has protracted the fever and retarded the cure in every ca&s;e where inflammatory &s;ymptoms have predominated, and inflammatory &s;ymptoms do
<PB N="80" REF="037274_0079_100CA571F684B210">
predominate at the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e in a con&s;iderable proportion of ca&s;es; except it be giv|en in do&s;es &s;ufficiently large to occa&s;ion copious evacuations from the bowels. Mercury has al&s;o invariably not only failed in curing, but has in|variably accelerated the fatal event in all the ca&s;es in which I have &s;een it employed, either in large or &s;mall do&s;es, when &s;ymptoms of malignity were evident. In more mild and &s;imple ca&s;es, milder remedies proved equally effectual and much le&s;s hazardous.</P>
<P>It is true that in mo&s;t ca&s;es in which &s;alivation was produced the patient recovered, and generally without any &s;ub&s;equent bad effect; whereas &s;eve|ral have been reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of com|pounding for life with the lo&s;s of their hair, teeth, and even part of a jaw bone, and &s;ome with con|&s;titutions &s;o impaired as to become walking &s;pec|tacles of wo! In &s;ome per&s;ons di&s;po&s;ed to gout a &s;mall do&s;e of calomel has impaired the dige&s;tive powers of the &s;tomach and rendered the &s;ufferer hypochondriac. The pain and debility it has &s;ome|times occa&s;ioned, have thrown the patient into con|vul&s;ions that have terminated in &s;udden death.</P>
<P>It was &s;eldom po&s;&s;ible to excite &s;alivation in any ca&s;e where &s;ymptoms of malignity were evident; on the contrary, mercury appeared to force out life in rapid &s;treams, and when &s;alivation was excited in
<PB N="81" REF="037274_0080_100CA574072C6918">
mild ca&s;es, it was by no means a proof that the mercury occa&s;ioned the removal of the di&s;ea&s;e, but more probably that the ce&s;&s;ation of the fever was the cau&s;e of the &s;alivation taking place; for in &s;imple and mild ca&s;es, a &s;olution of the fever gene|rally takes place without any remedy, on or be|fore the fifth day from the attack.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es where mercury has been given or con|tinued after evident marks of malignity have made their appearance, &s;uch as blue or du&s;ky &s;pots on the &s;kin, great depre&s;&s;ion of &s;trength, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and haemorrhages from the no&s;e and mouth, or from the bowels, it has de&s;troyed life with as much cer|tainty and almo&s;t with as much celerity as light|ning. We are informed by Kramer and Lind, that it once occa&s;ioned the &s;ame fatal effects among the Hungarian &s;oldiers in the advanced &s;tage of the &s;curvy.</P>
<P>Mercury was once in as much credit in the pre|vention and cure of the &s;mall pox as it has been of late in the yellow fever; but (with a few excep|tions) is at pre&s;ent entirely out of credit in that di&s;ea&s;e, and would &s;oon be the &s;ame in the yellow fever, if we were to judge of its utility from the abu&s;e or mi&s;application that has been made of it, abu&s;e which has attached the idea of horror to the very name of mercury. There are circum&s;tances, however, &s;ometimes attending this di&s;ea&s;e, in which

mercury has done the mo&s;t con&s;picuous &s;ervice, and in which it has mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly re&s;cued many valua|ble lives from the gra&s;p of death. The ca&s;es in which mercury has performed this extraordinary &s;ervice, have been accompanied with evident &s;igns of local conge&s;tion or effu&s;ion, and particularly in ca&s;es of coma, in which the dilated pupils indicated compre&s;&s;ion of the brain from conge&s;tion or effu&s;ion. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, it was given in large and repeated do&s;es.</P>
<P>In the year 1744, &s;alivation was recommended in the plague, in an Inaugural Di&s;&s;ertation by Mr. Lowry of Edinburgh, in conformity to the theory which was taught at that time, that all febrile di&s;|ea&s;es depended on morbific matter in the blood: a doctrine which has &s;ince been demon&s;trated to be extremely erroneous.</P>
<P>The &s;weating treatment, by the means directed by Dr. Warren of Barbadoes, and by cordial and &s;timulating remedies, and the external applications of heat and moi&s;ture, whether with or without a load of oppre&s;&s;ive bed-clothes, as far as I have been able to learn, proved not only un&s;ucce&s;sful, but in the majority of ca&s;es that &s;ubmitted to it was a &s;peedy though painful pa&s;&s;port to the grave.</P>
<P>When ten&s;ion of the pul&s;e, with hot &s;kin, indi|cated inflammatory diathe&s;is, and e&s;pecially when
<PB N="83" REF="037274_0082_100CA578B7908490">
accompanied with pain in the head, &s;ide or &s;to|mach, in addition to the antiphlogi&s;tic regimen and frequent purging, by means of a &s;olution of glau|bers &s;alts and tartarized antimony, blood-letting was of &s;en&s;ible &s;ervice; and in &s;ome extraordinary ca&s;es, where no mercury was u&s;ed, the &s;ymptoms called for it to a fourth or fifth time at the &s;hort intervals of eight or ten hours. In mild ca&s;es, where mercury was given in &s;mall do&s;es &s;o as to keep up an inflammatory diathe&s;is, bleeding has been employed to an almo&s;t incredible extent, and in many ca&s;es without apparent injury; but as the di&s;ea&s;e was then an artificial one, and not the ori|ginal fever, I leave it for others to determine the propriety of &s;uch treatment.</P>
<P>In general, in the mo&s;t inflammatory ca&s;es, three moderate bleedings, when aided by the free u&s;e of cathartics, were the greate&s;t number nece&s;&s;ary; and it was for the mo&s;t part nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;trict bleeding to the fir&s;t three days from the attack of the fever.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es where the fever began with great and &s;udden pro&s;tration of &s;trength, and the &s;ymptoms continued with great oppre&s;&s;ion and weight about the heart, accompanied with pale or livid counte|nance, low pul&s;e and moderate heat, and &s;uch ca&s;es were numerous, bleeding did manife&s;t and irrepa|rable injury.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="037274_0083_100CA57A44EE0620">
In a di&s;ea&s;e, therefore, which varies &s;o &s;urpri&s;|ingly in different ca&s;es, no preci&s;e rules for blood-letting can be laid down; but the practitioner mu&s;t be governed by the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, which a careful examination of the leading &s;ymptoms will unfold to his view.&mdash;I do not pretend to explain the rea&s;on why the contagion acts as &s;timulant in one patient, and as a poi&s;on which expels or di&s;&s;olves the vital principle in another, and leaves every fibre in his body &s;oft, putrid and powerle&s;s; but repeat|ed ob&s;ervations warrant me in a&s;&s;erting this to be the fact.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es where &s;ymptoms of malignity and great debility in the animal powers made their appear|ance early, or came on in the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, I think I have &s;een the fatal event longer retarded by the liberal u&s;e of &s;ulphuric acid &s;ufficiently di|luted with water; wa&s;hing the patient's body and limbs at the &s;ame time two or three times a day with cold wine, or brandy and water, than by any other remedies. The body and limbs were wiped dry after every wa&s;hing, and covered from the air for &s;ome time. If &s;en&s;ible &s;trength &s;ucceeded the wa&s;hing, it was encouragement to proceed with it in the &s;ame manner. When that was not the ca&s;e, warm applications were &s;ub&s;tituted.</P>

When that dreaded &s;ymptom, the black vomit|ing,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The judicious experiments lately made by Dr. I.

Some in&s;tances have al&s;o been recorded, in other places, of the di&s;ea&s;e being cured by the liberal u&s;e of brandy and water taken cold.</P>
<P>The cold bath, as recommended by Drs. Wright, Jack&s;on, M'Clean and others, was repeatedly tried in the early &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e in the year 1793, in Philadelphia, but without the beneficial effects that were expected from it; in con&s;equence of which it has not been re&s;umed here. In the We&s;t Indies, tho&s;e gentlemen &s;till per&s;i&s;t in declaring it &s;ucceeded, after the early lo&s;s of from 15 to 20 ounces of blood, an active cathartic, and previous immer&s;ion in the warm bath, the patient being put to bed immediately after the application of the cold water, and taking mild tepid drinks. This proce&s;s they advi&s;e to be renewed, without the bleeding,

in a few hours, if the fever does not &s;en&s;ibly &s;ub|&s;ide and the patient feel relief.</P>
<P>In the year 1797, Dr. Hodge employed full vo|miting in the early &s;tage of the fever, after mode|rate bloodletting, with remarkable &s;ucce&s;s; for of &s;eventy patients which he treated in this manner, he lo&s;t but three.</P>
<P>Wine, bark and opium, &s;o frequently beneficial in bilious and typhous fevers, were found decidedly injurious in every ca&s;e of the yellow fever&mdash;a fact which affords an additional argument in confirma|tion of the doctrine, that it does not only differ in degree but in kind from the bilious fever of this country.</P>
<P>When the febrile &s;ymptoms &s;uddenly &s;ub&s;ided, and were &s;hortly after &s;ucceeded by ince&s;&s;ant incli|nation to vomit, with great re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s and &s;ighing, which in dangerous ca&s;es generally occurred on the third or fourth day from the attack, moderate and repeated bloodletting, cly&s;ters, and bli&s;ters to the &s;tomach and thighs, and the liberal u&s;e of cool aci|dulated drinks, were the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful remedies, although the apparent debility &s;eemed to contra|indicate their u&s;e. In the latter &s;tage of dangerous ca&s;es with typhous &s;ymptoms, unconnected with &s;ymptoms of inflamed &s;tomach or conge&s;tions in the brain, liver, or any of the other vi&s;cera, bolu&s;es of

volatile &s;alts, in&s;tantly followed by a table &s;poonful of lemon juice diluted with cool water, and in &s;ome ca&s;es camphorated vinegar, have been employed with apparent benefit. Port wine and porter, as well as every other remedy that &s;timulated con&s;i|diderably or &s;uddenly, aggravated the di&s;ea&s;e; whereas the diluted juices of fre&s;h vegetables, par|ticularly of lemons, oranges, grapes and currants, bottled &s;mall beer and mead, were not only fre|quently beneficial but highly grateful to the patient.</P>
<P>Dr. Ferriar of Manche&s;ter has found the nitrous acid in do&s;es of half a drachm, given three times a day, very u&s;eful in the latter &s;tages of the common typhus, or low nervous fever.</P>
<P>Dr. Garnet of Gla&s;gow and Dr. J. Currie of Liverpool have found &s;till more beneficial effects from the u&s;e of the oxygenated muriate of pota&s;h, in do&s;es of from three to &s;ix grains according to Dr. Garnet, and fifteen grains according to Dr. Currie, who directs it to be increa&s;ed according to its ef|fects, and remarks, "Sometimes it &s;eems as inactive as any other neutral &s;alt, but at other times it very much increa&s;es the heat of the body."</P>
<P>As in malignant ca&s;es of every kind of fever there appears to be an extraordinary deficiency of oxygene, if we may judge from the colour and con|&s;i&s;tence of the blood, medicines which contain the

greate&s;t portion of that material, and part with it mo&s;t ea&s;ily, promi&s;e to be the mo&s;t u&s;eful remedies. On this principle, the oxygenated muriate of pot|a&s;h will be found &s;uperior to any other remedy at pre&s;ent known; for "about &s;eventy-five inches of extremely pure oxygene gas may be procured by means of heat from one hundred grains of this &s;alt, to which the oxygene is &s;o loo&s;ely attached that it is di&s;engaged even by the light of the &s;un. It is rapidly di&s;engaged, and combines with combu&s;tible &s;ub&s;tances, as is evident from its detonation with &s;ulphur, and &s;till more violently with pho&s;phorus. We may therefore conclude, it will be readily de|compo&s;ed by the carbon and hydrogen in the blood, and increa&s;e the proportion of oxygene, and pre|vent any further tendency in the &s;olids to gan|grene."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Annals of Medicine for 1797 and 1798.</NOTE></P>

<P>THE &s;hip Gen. Wayne came to Ten-Eyck's wharf (at Coentie's &s;lip on the Ea&s;t river) the 14th of July la&s;t, and began to di&s;charge her cargo the next day or the day following. Mr. Olm&s;ted (the clerk of Alderman Coles) and F. Barber (the clerk of Me&s;&s;rs. Duryee and Heyer) vi&s;ited the Gen. Wayne on or about the 17th of July while the cargo was di&s;charging. The former was taken &s;ick the 19th or 20th and died on the 26th of the &s;ame month: the latter was taken ill on the 20th and died on the 27th&mdash;(Atte&s;ted before Alderman De La Montagnie by Mr. W. Leacraft, in&s;pector of the cu&s;toms.) Michael Galor who al&s;o vi&s;ited the Gen. Wayne while di&s;charging her cargo, was taken ill with fever the 20th of July and died on the 26th. David Sturgis, who bored &s;ome of the
<PB N="90" REF="037274_0089_100CA5879455E6F0">
boxes of &s;ugar belonging to the Gen. Wayne, was taken with the fever the 21&s;t of July and died on the 28th.&mdash;(Atte&s;ted by Mr. Ch. Duryee.) Brom John&s;on, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in di&s;charging the cargo, was taken ill with fever on the 20th of July, but reco|vered.&mdash;(Atte&s;ted by Mrs. Winans at who&s;e hou&s;e he was taken ill.)</P>
<P>A &s;loop called the Farmer lay at the &s;ame wharf with the Gen. Wayne while di&s;charging her cargo. About the 20th of July, on her pa&s;&s;age up the North river, Abram Schoonmaker, the ma&s;ter of the &s;loop, and John Ploegh, were taken ill on board, and both died, the former on the 26th, the latter on the 27th of July. Dr. Vander Lyn, of E&s;opus, declares, that he &s;aw John Ploegh the day of his death, that he had the black vomit, and that his eyes and &s;kin were of a deep yellow. Schoonmaker's tongue was very brown and his &s;kin con&s;iderably yellow.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph Doughty, merchant, of Dutche&s;s county, declared before one of the aldermen, that he was taken ill with fever on the 20th of July, &s;oon after leaving Coentie's &s;lip, where he had lodged on board Captain North's &s;loop, which lay along&s;ide or near to the Gen. Wayne while &s;he was di&s;charg|ing her cargo.</P>
<P>Eleazer Cottrill landed a quantity of fire-wood from on board the &s;chooner Hypogryph in Coen|tie's

&s;lip while the Gen. Wayne lay there, and on board of which it was proved on oath he had been, and was taken ill with fever &s;oon after, of which he died at Middletown, New Jer&s;ey.</P>
<P>William Schooly, one of the hands belonging to the Gen. Wayne, has al&s;o given a certificate, pub|li&s;hed in the Argus of Sept. 9th, 1799, in which he declares, that "during the time the ve&s;&s;el lay at the Havanna, two of the hands died of the yel|low fever, and were buried on &s;hore: the evening after the ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed from the Havanna, on her return to New York, one man died of the &s;ame di&s;order, and on the &s;econd day another, who were both thrown overboard: and that on or about the 14th of June, when he was impre&s;&s;ed and taken on board a Briti&s;h man of war, nineteen of the crew were ill of the yellow fever, and only four men and the Captain well on board." The declaration of William Schooly, however, appears, from the ma|nife&s;t taken in the cabin of the ve&s;&s;el on the 22d of June, immediately after her arrival at the quaran|tine anchorage at Staten-i&s;land, to be incorrect with re&s;pect to the number &s;ick at the time of his impre&s;&s;|ment, though it appears to agree with the manife&s;t in other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>Dr. Bayley acknowledges,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the preceding Sketch at page 54.</NOTE> that &s;ome of the hands had died on board before and after her arri|val
<PB N="92" REF="037274_0091_100CA58B2A30A0F0">
at the quarantine ground. He, however, &s;till maintains that the di&s;ea&s;e was not introduced into New York la&s;t year by the Gen. Wayne or any other ve&s;&s;el, but was generated by the mud and putrid materials of Coentie's &s;lip.&mdash;In &s;upport of this opinion, he a&s;&s;erts, that the yellow fever in the years 1797 and 1798 made its appearance on the very &s;ame &s;pot, in the &s;ame month, and within a few days of the &s;ame time. In addition to this declaration, he a&s;&s;erts, &s;everal ca&s;es of yellow fever had occurred in New York before the arrival of the Gen. Wayne. That there were a few &s;pora|dic ca&s;es of the yellow fever in New York is ac|knowledged by Dr. Ho&s;ack, who has explained it upon a very different and in my opinion much more &s;atisfactory principle than Dr. Bayley, who mo&s;t evidently confounds the yellow fever with the com|mon remitting fever of warm &s;ea&s;ons and mar&s;hy &s;ituations, to which it bears no more analogy than the &s;mall-pox or meazles. It mu&s;t be acknowledg|ed, however, that Dr. Bayley has &s;upported his opinion with much plau&s;ibility, and an ingenuity that indicates con&s;iderable talents.</P>
<P>For the defence of his opinions, and the circum|&s;tances on which he re&s;ts his belief that the yellow fever is not a contagious di&s;ea&s;e, the reader is re|ferred to the New York Gazette, of the 16th of January la&s;t, printed by Mr. John Lang.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Dr. G. Blane, a Gentleman of the fir&s;t Medical Reputation in England, to an Official Character at the Briti&s;h Court, from the United States of America, dated London 26th No|vember, 1798.</HEAD>
<P>THE adopting of mea&s;ures for the prevention of di&s;ea&s;e, is one of the mo&s;t important duties of a wi&s;e and patriotic government, and the di&s;covery of the&s;e means, as well as the efficiency of the &s;teps to be taken, mu&s;t depend on a thorough knowledge of the cau&s;es by which it is excited and influenc|ed. My opportunities upon actual &s;ervice in the We&s;t Indies, in the late war, when phy&s;ician to the fleet under the command of Lord Rodney and Ad|miral Pigot, and my pre&s;ent official duty as a mem|ber of the medical board of the navy, have nece&s;|&s;arily brought to my knowledge a number of facts relating to this &s;ubject; and I &s;hall be extremely happy, if the communication of &s;ome of the mo&s;t important of them can throw any light which may prove u&s;eful to the American government, in checking an evil &s;o afflicting and calamitous.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion that occurs with a view to preventive mea&s;ures is whether this di&s;ea&s;e be infec|tious, and under what circum&s;tances it is &s;o?</P>
<P>In tho&s;e &s;ituations in which I ob&s;erved it in the We&s;t Indies it was evidently &s;o. There was the
<PB N="94" REF="037274_0093_100CA58F56BA0610">
mo&s;t inconte&s;tible evidence of this both on board of &s;hips and at ho&s;pitals, and the doubts which have ari&s;en on this point, &s;eem to have ari&s;en from the effects of infection, being blended with tho&s;e which aro&s;e from other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>But whatever doubts there may be on this &s;ubject in the We&s;t Indies there can be none in the climate of North America. This will be the be&s;t proved and illu&s;trated by an example:</P>
<P>On the 16th of May 1795, the Thetis and Hu&s;&s;ar frigates captured two French armed &s;hips from Guadaloupe, on the coa&s;t of America. One of the&s;e had the yellow fever on board, and out of fourteen men &s;ent from the Hu&s;&s;ar to take care of her, nine died of this fever before &s;he reached Ha|lifax on the 28th of the &s;ame month, and the five others were &s;ent to the ho&s;pital. Part of the pri|&s;oners were removed on board of the Hu&s;&s;ar, and though care was taken to &s;elect tho&s;e in perfect health, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread rapidly in that &s;hip, &s;o that near one-third of the whole crew was more or le&s;s affected by it.</P>
<P>This fact carries a conviction of the reality of in|fection as irre&s;i&s;tible as volumes of argument; and it further affords matter of important and in&s;tructive information, by proving that the infection may be conveyed by men in health.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from Doctor Ho&s;ack, dated New York, February 22d, 1800.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I received your favour of the 19th in&s;t. reque&s;t|ing any evidence in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, relative to the origin of the <HI>yellow fever</HI> as it appeared in <HI>New York</HI> during the la&s;t &s;ummer.</P>
<P>In reply to your reque&s;t, I believe there have been two &s;ources of the di&s;ea&s;e of the la&s;t year; the one I believe to have been the remains of the <HI>poi&s;on</HI> of the preceding year, where care had not been taken to clean&s;e or de&s;troy the clothing and bedding of the &s;ick. It is al&s;o po&s;&s;ible that goods which may have become charged with infection from being expo&s;ed in the atmo&s;phere in which the di&s;|ea&s;e formerly prevailed, may have given origin to &s;ome ca&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e which appeared the la&s;t &s;ummer. It certainly accords with the ob&s;ervations of practical writers, that infection is not totally de|&s;troyed in a &s;ingle &s;ea&s;on. Upon this principle I &s;hould be very much &s;urpri&s;ed if the yellow fever &s;hould entirely di&s;appear in one or even two years after the mo&s;t rigid quarantine that could be de|vi&s;ed. But in my opinion this was not the <HI>only &s;ource</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;e of the la&s;t &s;ummer.</P>
<P>I enclo&s;e you a copy of the te&s;timonies relative to the importation of it by the &s;hip Gen. Wayne.
<PB N="96" REF="037274_0095_100CA59375C15658">
The&s;e te&s;timonies have been collected by a very worthy and re&s;pectable man, Mr. Thomas Storm. Some time after Dr. R. Bayley, our health officer, publi&s;hed &s;ome remarks with the view if po&s;&s;ible to remove the impre&s;&s;ion from the minds of our citizens which they were calculated to produce; a copy of which is al&s;o enclo&s;ed. You will ob|&s;erve, he premi&s;es a declaration, that the yellow fe|ver appeared in this city before the arrival of the Gen. Wayne, and refers to three or four per&s;ons as examples, and quotes Dr. Miller and my&s;elf as the phy&s;icians who attended one of them. It is true Mr. Stephen&s;on died of the yellow fever; but if the foregoing <HI>principle</HI> be ju&s;t, it will account for his ca&s;e, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> expo&s;ure to the latent infection of the preceding year revived and rendered active by returning heat, which may have been retained in goods, &amp;c. To this I can add the ca&s;e of another per&s;on whom I vi&s;ited, before the arrival of the <HI>Wayne,</HI> at the New York ho&s;pital ill of this di&s;ea&s;e: this per&s;on arrived in a ve&s;&s;el from the Havanna. He told me that &s;ome others had been ill on board the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el on her pa&s;&s;age, and had died of the <HI>yellow fever.</HI> As he had all the characteri&s;tic &s;ymp|toms of the yellow fever, I reported him at the health office; he was directly conveyed to Staten I&s;land, where, I am informed he died a few days after.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="037274_0096_100CA59585E8B200">
<HI>When we thus find per&s;ons ill with this di&s;ea&s;e, or coming from infected ports, without pa&s;&s;ing through a regular quarantine, permitted to come to the city with their ve&s;&s;els, we &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed, that ca&s;es of the yellow fever appeared in New York be|fore the arrival of the Gen. Wayne.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ame letter of Dr. Bayley, he tells you that it appeared preci&s;ely at the &s;ame &s;pot where it had appeared in 1797 and 1798. But, he has omitted to add that it very &s;oon prevailed in Bar|clay &s;treet, in Warren, Murray and Chambers &s;treets, <HI>a part of the city which had been</HI> heretofore proverbially healthy. Whether it was not com|municated by contagion to this part of the city you will readily judge.&mdash;The&s;e &s;treets have <HI>no re|po&s;itories</HI> of <HI>filth,</HI> no &s;unken, new-filled lots, no &s;ewers, no dead hor&s;es half buried to poi&s;on the at|mo&s;phere. If it were the product of the corrupted atmo&s;phere of Coentie's &s;lip, and is not contagious, how did it get into this part of the city?</P>
<P>Before I conclude I mu&s;t add another fact which, in my opinion, is very much oppo&s;ed to the favourite doctrine of our <HI>home-generating gentlemen.</HI> Our in&s;pector general of beef, Mr. Edmund Prior, a well-informed and careful ob&s;erver, informed me that of 40 per&s;ons whom he had employed during the la&s;t &s;ummer in examining the beef, and in re|moving and emptying &s;uch barrels as were found
<PB N="98" REF="037274_0097_100CA59832EA12A8">

<P>As a proof of my candour and impartiality on this &s;ubject, and as an apology for my <HI>&s;eeming</HI> in|con&s;i&s;tency, I mu&s;t inform you that in the year 1798, in which the di&s;ea&s;e was a&s;cribed here to the <HI>effluvia</HI> of <HI>putrid beef,</HI> having received informa|tion that Mr. Roorbeck, on Long I&s;land, had re|ceived the yellow fever, of which he died, from opening and handling a barrel of putrid beef which had floated upon the &s;hore where he re&s;ided, I communicated this fact as I then con&s;idered it, to Drs. Lett&s;ome, Pear&s;on and Mar&s;hal of London, and to profe&s;&s;ors Gregory, Duncan and Hamilton of Edinburgh, as an evidence oppo&s;ed to the opini|on I had previou&s;ly entertained and expre&s;&s;ed: I al&s;o added, if that fact &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed I &s;hould not he&s;itate immediately to renounce my former

opinion of its foreign &s;ource. But I have &s;ince been informed by a gentleman, who at that time re&s;ided on Long I&s;land, that Mr. Roorbeck, a few days before his illne&s;s, vi&s;ited a per&s;on ill of yellow fever, who had contracted it in New York, which at once invalidates the pretended and important fact of his having received it from the putrid beef. In the above expre&s;&s;ion of foreign &s;ource, plea&s;e to ob|&s;erve, I do not undertake to trace it to <HI>Siam,</HI> or any particular climate or country, but con&s;ider it as one of the &s;ame my&s;terious family of di&s;ea&s;es with the &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, plague, and many others who&s;e &s;pecific cau&s;es are unknown.&mdash;Here I mu&s;t end for the pre&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a &s;econd Letter from Dr. D. Ho&s;ack, dated March 3d, 1800.</HEAD>
<P>THIS morning I received yours of the 28th Feb. reque&s;ting permi&s;&s;ion to introduce my la&s;t, with the documents inclo&s;ed, into your publication. Although it was written in ha&s;te and only intended for your own in&s;pection, if you &s;hall judge it wor|thy of being made public, you have my permi&s;&s;ion to make &s;uch u&s;e of it as you may think proper.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="037274_0099_100CA64FD6B216D0">
I &s;hall now add a few ob&s;ervations on the treat|ment, in addition to tho&s;e contained in the Inaugu|ral Di&s;&s;ertation of my brother, reprinted in your city in 1797, by Mr. Dob&s;on, but mu&s;t premi&s;e the view of the di&s;ea&s;e which led me to adopt the mode of treatment I pur&s;ued, and which may not have been &s;ufficiently in&s;i&s;ted upon in that Di&s;&s;er|tation.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider fever to be of two kinds, either ari&s;ing from the &s;en&s;ible changes of the atmo&s;phere, or from a matter of a peculiar quality, introduced into the &s;y&s;tem: of the fir&s;t kind are &s;imple inflam|matory fever, pleuri&s;y, acute rheumati&s;m, inflam|mation of the brain, &s;tomach, inte&s;tines, and all tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which are purely inflammatory. Of the latter cla&s;s of fevers are &s;mall pox, mea&s;les, chicken pox, influenza, hooping cough, &s;carlet fe|ver, dy&s;entery, yellow fever, plague, &amp;c. &amp;c. ari&s;ing from certain noxious matters introduced in|to the &s;y&s;tem, which remain in it a certain length of time, producing more or le&s;s violent operation in proportion to the virulence of their nature, and at length "wear them&s;elves out," leaving the bo|dy more or le&s;s debilitated, according to their du|ration or their violence of action.</P>
<P>I have introduced this ob&s;ervation to illu&s;trate the analogy which I &s;uppo&s;e to exi&s;t in a certain degree between yellow fever and all tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es
<PB N="101" REF="037274_0100_100CA59BDE9AB780">
which ari&s;e from foreign matter introduced into the &s;y&s;tem. In the treatment of this cla&s;s of di&s;|ea&s;es, there appears to me but one principle to be pur&s;ued: to attend to the different functions of the body, that the action of the poi&s;on may be rendered as moderate as po&s;&s;ible, and that every other &s;ource of irritation be removed, until the cau&s;e producing the di&s;ea&s;e be entirely exhau&s;ted: and that the means of accompli&s;hing this indica|tion be &s;uch as lea&s;t debilitates the body.</P>
<P>In the management of yellow fever I have ap|plied the &s;ame doctrine; in this di&s;ea&s;e there is a peculiar poi&s;on introduced, which like the poi&s;on of the plague, or of a venomous &s;erpent, produced violent irritation and fever, with a derangement of all the functions of the body.</P>
<P>When thus introduced, the principles of my practice have been to moderate its action, and to remove every other &s;ource of irritation: both of the&s;e indications I believe may be generally accom|pli&s;hed by the &s;ame means, the chief of which ap|pear to be&mdash;fir&s;t, to remove from the bowels any matters which may aggravate the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Secondly&mdash;To re&s;tore the per&s;piration, which is for the mo&s;t part ob&s;tructed. I make this la&s;t a &s;e|parate article in the cure of this di&s;ea&s;e, ina&s;much as the matter di&s;charged by per&s;piration even in
<PB N="102" REF="037274_0101_100CA59D71078F38">
health is of a noxious quality (as is proved by the late experiments of Mr. Abernethy of London) and if retained mu&s;t add greatly to the fever and vitiated &s;tate of the fluids which take place in this di&s;ea&s;e. As to the medicines I have employed in accompli&s;hing the&s;e intentions, and the different remedies adapted to the peculiar condition and cir|cum&s;tances of the patient, I can add nothing more to what are detailed in the above mentioned di&s;|&s;ertation: they are the means I have experienced to be the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful. But that part of the treatment upon which I am di&s;po&s;ed to place the mo&s;t reliance, is &s;weating. Common ob&s;ervations have long &s;ince e&s;tabli&s;hed the importance of this remedy in fevers in general: but I was more par|ticularly directed to the advantages and nece&s;&s;ity of attending to this remedy in the treatment of the yellow fever, by Dr. John Bard of this city, and the writings of Dr. Warren, in his hi&s;tory of the yellow fever of Barbadoes.</P>
<P>If there is a &s;pecific in the cure of any di&s;ea&s;e; if the Peruvian bark is to be relied upon in the cure of intermittent fever, &s;weating, when induc|ed within <HI>the first twelve hours</HI> from the commence|ment of the di&s;ea&s;e, I believe I may venture to a&s;|&s;ert is a no le&s;s certain remedy in the cure of yel|low fever. In &s;hort, &s;o &s;trongly is my mind im|pre&s;&s;ed with the &s;alutary nature of this di&s;charge in yellow fever, and I have been &s;o rarely di&s;ap|pointed
<PB N="103" REF="037274_0102_100CA5A00E4CE768">
in its effects, that when I find my patient &s;weating within a few hours after the attack of the di&s;ea&s;e, I congratulate him as &s;ecure from dan|ger, provided it be continued a con&s;iderable length of time, thereby urging him to the diligent u&s;e of the means pre&s;cribed for accompli&s;hing it. It is a remedy I mo&s;t &s;incerely and devoutly recom|mend to your particular con&s;ideration and atten|tion; but to &s;ecure its good effects, I again repeat the remark, that it mu&s;t be employed as early as po&s;&s;ible, after attention to the bowels, which &s;hould be the fir&s;t object of the phy&s;ician's pre&s;cription.</P>
<P>Having been actively employed in the yellow fever of 1798 and 1799, I had an opportunity of pur&s;uing this mode of treatment upon an exten&s;ive &s;cale, and am prepared to bear the mo&s;t unequivo|cal te&s;timony in its favour. In the year 1798, Dr. Samuel Bard and my&s;elf vi&s;ited and attended about 550 patients with this di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;of this number we lo&s;t between 60 and 70.&mdash;In 1799 I attended 98 per&s;ons and lo&s;t 12.&mdash;Although the fa|tality of 1799 is nearly in the &s;ame proportion with that of 1798, there is a very material difference as it regards the practice we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> con|dition of the patients in tho&s;e different years.&mdash;In 1798 we lo&s;t many per&s;ons of great re&s;pectabili|ty, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> who were &s;o &s;ituated as to obtain every comfort which &s;ickne&s;s requires.&mdash;In 1799, except tho&s;e I vi&s;ited in con&s;ultation with other phy&s;icians,
<PB N="104" REF="037274_0103_100CA5A219A3F700">
which ca&s;es are not included in the li&s;t of my pa|tients, I did not lo&s;e more then than four where they had the advantages of good nur&s;ing, com|fortable lodging and pure air. In 1798, upon receiving the Narrative of Bryce on Yellow Fever, in addition to the te&s;timonies of Dr. Ru&s;h, Dr. Chi&s;holm and others, in favour of mercury, both Dr. Bard and my&s;elf re&s;olved to employ it with the expectation that it would prove a valuable auxiliary to the practice we then pur&s;ued. We accordingly employed it agreeably to the plan re|commended by tho&s;e gentlemen. We gave it in the fir&s;t in&s;tance with a view to its purgative effects, in do&s;es of ten grains&mdash;afterwards continued it as an alterative, in do&s;es of two grains, and in many in&s;tanc&egrave;s in conjunction with opium, to &s;ecure, if po&s;&s;ible, its operation upon the &s;alivary glands. In this manner we admini&s;tered it to our patients for the &s;pace of a fortnight; but that fortnight was a fatal period in our practice. During that &s;hort &s;pace of time near 40 of our patients fell victims to this mode of treatment. I tru&s;t the friends of the decea&s;ed will forgive me for this candid declara|tion, when they reflect upon the motives which in|duced us to make this alteration in our practice. In every ca&s;e wherein it proved fatal, it appeared to produce its effects by the irritation it excited in the &s;tomach. For I rarely introduced mercury in the yellow fever where it did not excite vomit|ing, or at lea&s;t &s;uch a degree of nau&s;ea as prevent|ed
<PB N="105" REF="037274_0104_100CA5A42553D4F8">
the &s;tomach from receiving a &s;ufficient quantity of drink to operate upon the &s;ecretions; but in many in&s;tances vomiting was induced by the fir&s;t do&s;e which was exhibited and did not cea&s;e until the death of the patient. Salivation was very rare|ly produced by the u&s;e of this medicine.</P>
<P>Having been thus unfortunate in the u&s;e of mercury, we immediately returned to our former mode of practice, which again proved as <HI>&s;ucce&s;sful</HI> as the mercurial treatment had been fatal. The la&s;t patient to whom I exhibited mercury was the &s;i&s;ter of Mr. Edmund Prior. Her &s;ituation became extremely dangerous, but &s;he recovered after &s;ix weeks illne&s;s. Compare her &s;ituation with the other members of Mr. Prior's family who were treated by the &s;udorific plan, as &s;tated in the ad|verti&s;ement publi&s;hed by Mr. Prior, under the &s;ig|nature of a Citizen, after his recovery from a &s;e|vere attack of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>If it were nece&s;&s;ary I could &s;ubjoin many te&s;|timonies of a &s;imilar nature, in favour of the treat|ment by purging and &s;weating, which has now become very general with our practitioners.</P>
<P>But it has been objected to the &s;udorific prac|tice by the advocates for the lancet, that it is very difficult to produce per&s;piration. I grant that it is in &s;ome in&s;tances attended with difficulty, but I
<PB N="106" REF="037274_0105_100CA5A5ADB18280">
have as generally remarked that this difficulty pro|ceeded from the &s;lovenly and carele&s;s manner with which the remedies for this purpo&s;e are employ|ed: but in the greater number of ca&s;es the per|&s;piration immediately follows the operation of the remedies made u&s;e of to open the bowels. The&s;e are &s;alts di&s;&s;olved in a large quantity of water|gruel, given warm and very frequently until they produce &s;ufficient di&s;charges by the bowels, aided in their operation by frequent draughts of warm gruel or warm lemonade. I al&s;o very particularly enjoin it upon my patient to remain in bed during the operation of his medicine, and &s;trange as it may appear, I add one or two blankets to the bed covering u&s;ually employed in the &s;ummer &s;ea|&s;on, that the atmo&s;phere immediately &s;urrounding the body may become warm and thereby relax the excretory ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin. Its proce&s;s is gene|rally &s;ucceeded by a very general and profu&s;e di&s;|charge. Where it is not &s;ufficient, I employ bricks heated and &s;teeped in vinegar, with fomentations of vinegar and water to the legs. In &s;ome in|&s;tances I have kept the lower extremities immer&s;ed in a ve&s;&s;el of warm vinegar and water for half an hour or upwards; at the &s;ame time &s;upplying my patient with warm drinks until the &s;urface of the body becomes relaxed.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate ca&s;es which I have met with in practice occurred la&s;t &s;ummer: the patient
<PB N="107" REF="037274_0106_100CA5A800047C70">
was Jonathan Burrell, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> of this city, ca&s;hier of the United States branch bank. He was attacked with the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of this di&s;ea&s;e, pain in the head, back and limbs; countenance flu&s;hed, eyes loaded, &s;kin hot and dry, pul&s;e frequent and hard. I immediately pre&s;cribed for him &s;alts and warm drinks in the manner before mentioned. After their operation his &s;ymptoms continued to increa&s;e, at|tended with a great propen&s;ity to &s;leep, bordering on &s;tupor&mdash;his &s;kin remained hot and dry, without the lea&s;t appearance of per&s;piration. Finding the above remedies were ineffectual, I immer&s;ed his legs in a ve&s;&s;el of warm water and vinegar, &s;upplied him largely with warm drinks, at the &s;ame time kept him well covered with his bed-clothes while &s;itting upon the &s;ide of the bed. In this &s;ituation he re|mained upwards of half an hour, when he became faint, his &s;kin relaxed and moi&s;t, and was followed with a mo&s;t profu&s;e per&s;piration, which was conti|nued by means of warm drinks for the &s;pace of three days, when his fever was entirely removed. During the whole of this proce&s;s he remained in bed, without change of bedding or clothing&mdash;this I con&s;ider a very nece&s;&s;ary regulation during the febrile &s;tage, and an e&s;&s;ential part of the &s;udorific treatment.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance of great importance in this mode of treatment, is, to continue the per&s;piration without the lea&s;t intermi&s;&s;ion until the fever is en|tirely
<PB N="108" REF="037274_0107_100CA5AB193AC938">
removed: for the lea&s;t check that is given to this di&s;charge is very apt to produce irritation at the &s;tomach, which, if not &s;peedily removed, is fol|lowed by that di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and characteri&s;tic &s;ymptom of this di&s;ea&s;e the <HI>black vomit.</HI> In this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e I have frequently employed bli&s;ters to the region of the &s;tomach with great benefit; but I have generally remarked, that they were rendered much more effectual in their operation by the con|tinuance of fomentations to the extremities.&mdash;When the heat and burning at the &s;tomach are not re|lieved by the&s;e remedies, and <HI>black vomit</HI> &s;ucceeds, we have little to hope of &s;ucce&s;s from any &s;ource whatever. <HI>Yeast</HI> and the <HI>&s;aline mixture</HI> have occa&s;ion|ally given relief in this de&s;perate period of the di&s;|ea&s;e; but there is one &s;pecies of the black vomit wherein the matter di&s;charged exhibits the appear|ance of coffee-grounds, in which I have been more &s;ucce&s;sful in the u&s;e of lime-water than with any other remedy&mdash;but that &s;pecies of black vomit, wherein the matter di&s;charged appears in the form of <HI>black flakes</HI> indicating a de&s;truction of the coats of the &s;tomach, I have never &s;een removed by lime-water or any other remedy. But in the fir&s;t men|tioned &s;pecies, if it were nece&s;&s;ary I could enumerate more than twenty ca&s;es, wherein this generally fatal &s;ymptom has been removed and the patients reco|vered by the u&s;e of the lime-water. In the follow|ing adverti&s;ement Dr. Bard bears witne&s;s to its &s;uc|ce&s;s in the&s;e ca&s;es: if it were required he could add

<P>Many re&s;pectable practitioners in this city have informed me that they have exhibited this remedy with great advantage, not only in removing the black vomit, but in allaying the <HI>heat, burning,</HI> and <HI>pain at the stomach,</HI> which are the u&s;ual precur&s;ors of the black vomit&mdash;but with many other medical gentlemen both in New York and Philadelphia, I find that lime-water has acquired but little reputa|tion. Their want of &s;ucce&s;s in the u&s;e of it I a&s;cribe to &s;everal cau&s;es: the fir&s;t is, that it was not em|ployed until every other remedy had failed; &s;everal in&s;tances of this &s;ort I have met with, in which it was not admini&s;tered until the pul&s;e was &s;carcely to be perceived, the extremities cold, and the vomit|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> continuance,
<PB N="111" REF="037274_0110_100CA5B14C03B2E8">
in which time the powers of life were nearly ex|hau&s;ted. A &s;econd cau&s;e of want of &s;ucce&s;s is, the exhibition of other remedies at the &s;ame time that the lime-water is employed. I have frequently ob|&s;erved tho&s;e gentlemen who are partial to the u&s;e of mercury, to continue the u&s;e of that medicine at the &s;ame time the lime-water was given. As the operation of mercury generally produces irritation at the &s;tomach, nau&s;ea and vomiting, it is &s;carcely to be expected of lime-water or any other remedy to compo&s;e the &s;tomach under tho&s;e circum&s;tances. I &s;hould as readily expect that lime-water would allay vomiting at the moment <HI>tartar emetic</HI> was exhibited with the view to excite it.</P>
<P>A third cau&s;e of the un&s;ucce&s;sful u&s;e of lime-water is the want of per&s;everance in the u&s;e of it. I was credibly informed, that a practitioner in this city who &s;tands high in his profe&s;&s;ion, upon hearing of this remedy, admini&s;tered a &s;ingle do&s;e of it, and upon its failure has never employed it a &s;econd time, but affects to de&s;pi&s;e it as inert and u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t employed lime-water in the yellow fever, I generally directed it to be mixed with an equal quantity of milk, and a winegla&s;s-<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the mixture to be given every hour. Since that time, I have in &s;everal in&s;tances given it in porter with bene|fit, where the mixture of it with milk was rejected. A Mr. Graham, whom I vi&s;ited la&s;t &s;ummer, on Long I&s;land, is a &s;triking example of the advantage
<PB N="112" REF="037274_0111_100CA5B2D410BFD0">
of this combination. Porter when given alone ne|ver failed to excite heat and pain at the &s;tomach, which continued until it was di&s;charged by vomit|ing, but mixed with the lime-water tho&s;e &s;ymp|toms were all allayed, and by the continuance of this remedy he was re&s;tored to health.</P>
<P>If the above rude and ha&s;ty outline of my practice in yellow fever may contain any hints which may prove of public utility, you are welcome to make &s;uch u&s;e of them as you may think proper.</P>

<P>My review of the &s;udorific plan of treating this di&s;ea&s;e was printed before I received Dr. Ho&s;ack's account of its &s;ucce&s;s in New York: and as it only applies to the mode in which it was conducted in a few ca&s;es in Philadelphia, it by no means applies to the mode of conducting it which he &s;o forcibly recommends on the authority of repeated facts.</P>
<P>From the experiments lately made by Dr. Cathrall, it appears that lime-water produces its &s;alutary effects by cor|recting the corro&s;ive acid which is generally contained in the &s;tomach at the time the black vomiting commences. On this principle calcined magne&s;ia would have a &s;imilar effect.</P>
