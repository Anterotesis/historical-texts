<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 CHRONICLES xxix. 11.</BIBL>
<Q><P>&mdash; Thine is the KINGDOM, O LORD, and thou art ex|alted as HEAD above ALL.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the pa&s;&s;age which has now been read, we have the devout acknowledgment of king David, who was the fir&s;t magi&s;trate, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectable kingdom, which, at that time, exi&s;ted. He was as remarkable for piety and religion, as for emi|nence and di&s;tinction, in the Jewi&s;h nation.</P>
<P>IT was not an incon&s;iderable evidence, of the fer|vor of his piety, that he maintained the mo&s;t ex|alted and reverential conceptions of God, in the height of earthly magnificence, amid the &s;plen|dor and pomp of a Court, which &s;o commonly
<PB N="6" REF="036380_0005_1008F6AEBA62ABA8">
dazzle the eyes of mankind, and plunge them in|to &s;cenes of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>NEBUCHADNEZZAR, who was at the head of the Chaldean Empire, was &s;o intoxicated, with the &s;plendors of royalty, that <HI>"his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pride,"</HI> &s;o that he did not know and con&s;ider, <HI>"That the MOST HIGH ruleth in the kingdom of men."</HI> And, fact and experience afford the mo&s;t convincing evidence, that worldly di&s;tinctions and honors, through the native corrup|tion of the human heart, have a mo&s;t powerful tendency to render men unmindful of Him, by whom "kings reign and princes decree ju&s;tice." But, this was very far from being exemplified in David. Although, from a &s;hepherd, he was rai&s;ed to a throne, and exalted as the head of a re&s;pecta|ble and truly great nation, which always reveren|ced his authority; yet, he did not, through pride of heart, &s;o rate his dignity and worldly con&s;e|quence, as to think it beneath him, devoutly to ac|knowledge God, as the Supreme Ruler of the uni|ver&s;e. He was &s;en&s;ible, that his elevated &s;tation and worldly magnificence, were the fruit and ef|fect, of God's &s;overeign di&s;po&s;al. In the text, he mo&s;t devoutly a&s;cribes every thing to Him. "Thine is the <HI>kingdom,</HI> O LORD, and thou art exalted as <HI>head</HI> above ALL." And, in the &s;ucceeding words, "Both <HI>riches</HI> and <HI>honors</HI> come of thee&mdash;in thine
<PB N="7" REF="036380_0006_1008F6B16AD462D0">hand it is to <HI>make</HI> great, and to give <HI>&s;trength</HI> unto all."</P>
<P>IT may be further ob&s;erved, that king David was not only ready, mo&s;t &s;olemnly to acknowledge, the <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> of God; but he viewed and reveren|ced him "as head above all." Not as the proph|et Elijah &s;arca&s;tically de&s;cribed Baal, as an <HI>idle talker,</HI> or as <HI>pur&s;uing a journey,</HI> or as <HI>&s;leeping</HI>; or, in a word, as being an <HI>idle</HI> and <HI>unconcerned &s;pectator</HI> of the world; but as being particularly concerned in the government and control of the univer&s;e.&mdash;"Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all."</P>
<P>THE text will naturally direct our attention, to the two following things.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE <HI>nature</HI> of that <HI>kingdom,</HI> which is &s;aid, in the text, to be the LORD's.</P>
<P N="2">II. IN what &s;en&s;e the kingdom may be &s;aid to be the LORD's, and that He is exalted as HEAD above all.</P>
<P>IT is hoped, that in the pro&s;ecution of what has now been propo&s;ed, &s;uch ob&s;ervations and remarks will be made, as will render the di&s;cour&s;e both &s;ea|&s;onable, and pertinent to this public anniver&s;ary.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="036380_0007_1008F6B3BA379C38">I. IT is propo&s;ed, to attend to the <HI>nature</HI> of that kingdom, which, in the text, is &s;aid to be the LORD's.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of this world, are divided into many kingdoms and governments, which, in the &s;acred &s;criptures, are called "the kingdom of men." But that kingdom which is &s;aid, in the text, to be the LORD's, has not a re&s;pect to any <HI>one</HI> of tho&s;e kingdoms, in exclu&s;ion of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>THE time has been, indeed, when God took upon him&s;elf the government of the Hebrews; and, in his di&s;pen&s;ations, a very &s;pecial re&s;pect was paid them. His admini&s;trations were particularly di|rected, to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of that <HI>favorite</HI> people; yet God was, at the &s;ame time, as truly at the head of other nations, and did di&s;po&s;e of and &s;u|perintend all their affairs, in the &s;ame manner that he did the affairs and concerns of the Jews. God had purpo&s;es to an&s;wer, relative to the Jewi&s;h na|tion, which he had not re&s;pecting other nations; for they were a <HI>cho&s;en people.</HI> Although the allot|ments of God, to other nations, were &s;ubordina|ted to the advancement of the Hebrews, yet, e|vents were alloted out to the former, in as <HI>immediate</HI> and <HI>efficient</HI> a manner as they were to the latter. The purpo&s;es of God, re&s;pecting different nations, have been different; yet God has not at the pre&s;ent time, nor ever had in time pa&s;t, a more immediate
<PB N="9" REF="036380_0008_1008F6B577D7B720">
di&s;po&s;al of the affairs of one nation than of anoth|er. The kingdom, which in the text is called the LORD's, is not limited by or confined to any earthly kingdom.</P>
<P>BUT, the kingdom which is the Lord's does, in a &s;en&s;e, embrace the <HI>univer&s;e</HI>; con&s;i&s;ting of all ranks and grades of creatures, throughout all worlds. The government of God extends to all things, both animate and inanimate. All the worlds and creatures which God hath made, con|&s;titute one &s;y&s;tem. The various orders of exi&s;ten|ces, from the archangel to the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable in&s;ect, con&s;titute the links of a perfect chain, and are like wheels which are nece&s;&s;ary to complete a perfect machine. They are all nece&s;&s;ary to form a perfect &s;y&s;tem. And, as the Lord is "exalted as head above all," &s;o all things which exi&s;t, are com|prehended in his kingdom. God manages every part of the univer&s;e, in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hall be&s;t an&s;wer the purpo&s;es which he had in view, when he brought them into being.</P>
<P>THE &s;acred &s;criptures teach us, thus to con&s;ider the <HI>extent</HI> of the kingdom which is the Lord's. In them, God is &s;aid to rule among the nations&mdash;to build them up or pluck them down at what in&s;tant he plea&s;es. Famine, pe&s;tilence and the &s;word are
<PB N="10" REF="036380_0009_1008F6B8961C3F70">&s;aid to be under his control. It is God who bal|ances the clouds, and gives the former and the latter rain in their &s;ea&s;on. And it is further a&s;|&s;erted, that the &s;uperintending care and di&s;po&s;ing hand of God are concerned, even in the falling of the &s;parrow to the ground. The kingdom which is the Lord's, therefore, comprehends the univer&s;e. Hence, in the text, God is &s;aid to be "exalted as HEAD above ALL,"&mdash;above every thing which ex|i&s;ts.</P>
<P>AGAIN; to our having proper apprehen&s;ions of the kingdom which is the LORD's, it is nece&s;&s;ary to bring into view not only its <HI>extent,</HI> but the <HI>object</HI> or <HI>end</HI> of it.</P>
<P>GOD does not exerci&s;e a control over the uni|ver&s;e, and concern him&s;elf with the affairs of all ranks of creatures, as a mere <HI>amu&s;ement</HI>; he has an important object in view, in all his admini&s;tra|tions; and, that is to rai&s;e up and e&s;tabli&s;h a king|dom of <HI>holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>THE government of God does con&s;i&s;t, &s;umma|rily, in &s;o conducting and arranging events, as &s;hall, eventually, advance the &s;piritual and moral good of the univer&s;e, or e&s;tabli&s;h a holy and &s;pir|itual kingdom. All the plans, in&s;titutions and op|erations of God are directed to that end. The end
<PB N="11" REF="036380_0010_1008F6BC6B157AE0">of the natural is the moral world. As all the ranks and orders of exi&s;tencies are to be con&s;idered, as &s;o many links of a perfect chain, &s;o all the <HI>events</HI> which take place, and all God's appoint|ments and in&s;titutions are to be viewed, as &s;o many means to advance the moral and &s;piritual good, or the holine&s;s and happine&s;s of intelligent beings; and &s;o to e&s;tabli&s;h and perfect a kingdom of holi|ne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s. And, all being united, do form a perfect &s;y&s;tem of means and events, for the &s;ecurity of &s;o important an object.&mdash;As the ad|vancement and e&s;tabli&s;hment of a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s require, God builds up or pulls down earthly kingdoms. The great Monarchies of the world, which have been rai&s;ed up and again tumbled into ruin, have been &s;ubordinated to this intere&s;ting de&s;ign. The con&s;titution and laws of the natural world, when they cea&s;e to contribute to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch a kingdom, will be aboli&s;hed; yea, the whole natural world, when it &s;hall have accompli&s;hed every thing of that nature which it can an&s;wer, will be con&s;igned over to de&s;truction. Events will roll on until a holy and &s;piritual kingdom &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed and become triumphant. Then, the rotation of events, like the pre&s;ent, &s;hall cea&s;e. Earthly kingdoms and empires &s;hall &s;ink into ruin&mdash;the &s;un &s;hall &s;hine no more, the various parts of the natural world &s;hall be unhinged&mdash;a univer&s;al conflagration will
<PB N="12" REF="036380_0011_1008F6BDF8DB6F68">take place, and former things &s;hall be remember|ed no more.</P>
<P>THAT this repre&s;entation, of the object of God's government, is real and not imaginary, appears from many con&s;iderations, which can be but very briefly mentioned, at this time.</P>
<P>IT appears, very particularly, from the de&s;ign of the incarnation and &s;acrifice of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; or the introduction of the mediatorial plan.</P>
<P>THIS great event is con&s;idered, in the &s;acred wri|tings, as above all others calculated, to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es, which God had in view, in the whole work of creation and the government of the world. And, the end which God had in view in that a&s;ton|i&s;hing event was, indubitably, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a kingdom of holine&s;s. Hence it is &s;aid, that he "gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us <HI>from all iniquity,</HI> and <HI>purify</HI> unto him&s;elf a <HI>peculiar people, zealous of good works.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Titus ii.14.</NOTE> And the church is &s;aid to be redeemed by his blood, "to the intent, that now unto the principalities and powers, in heavenly places might be known, by the <HI>Church,</HI> the manifold wi&s;dom of God; according to the <HI>eternal purpo&s;e</HI> which he purpo&s;ed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;. iii.10, 11.</NOTE> And, Je&s;us Chri&s;t is now exalted at
<PB N="13" REF="036380_0012_1008F6C06DEFD3A0">the head of all principalities and powers, and will reign until all enemies are brought at his foot&s;tool. And the i&s;&s;ue of this great affair is &s;ummed up in this, that God &s;hall "reconcile all things to him|&s;elf, by him, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven." From the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;crip|ture, as well as from the declarations and prophe|&s;ies concerning the increa&s;e, progre&s;s and i&s;&s;ue of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, which is founded in his blood, it is extremely evident, that the end God had in view, in the incarnation, death and &s;uffer|ings of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and in the whole work of re|demption, was the advancement and e&s;tabli&s;hment of a kingdom of holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s. And, from thence we may certainly infer, that this is the great object, which God has in view in his whole government.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame conclu&s;ion becomes further evident, from the end, which God has in view, in the <HI>reli|gious in&s;titutions</HI> he hath made. The end propo&s;ed in in&s;titutions of a religious nature, is, unque&s;tion|ably, to render mankind holy and &s;piritual.</P>
<P>AGAIN; that the end God has in view, and that the object of his government is, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s is evident, from the great and fundamental laws of his kingdom; or, from what he chiefly requires, of his intelli|gent
<PB N="14" REF="036380_0013_1008F6C2F21CC7F8">creatures. God's requirements are all &s;um|med up in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;in univer&s;al love and good will. This clearly indicates what that is, at which God is aiming in his government; and, particularly, that it is the advancement of a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>THAT the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a kingdom of right|eou&s;ne&s;s, is the great object of the government of God, appears, not only, from the end propo&s;ed in the work of redemption, in all religious in&s;titu|tions, and from the requirement of the laws he has e&s;tabli&s;hed; but, it is al&s;o evident, from the de&s;ign of civil government.</P>
<P>CIVIL government was not in&s;tituted, merely to amu&s;e men; nor, to lift up &s;ome over the heads of others, without propo&s;ing an important object. And, although it is an in&s;titution, which is pecul|iar to this world, and may &s;eem more immediately de&s;igned to protect men from injury and violence; yet, Is it not certain, that like the other in&s;titutions of God, it is ultimately de&s;igned for and to be ad|mini&s;tered, with a view to the advancement and e&s;|tabli&s;hment of a &s;piritual and holy kingdom?</P>
<P>I AM not in&s;en&s;ible, that &s;ome are fond of mak|ing, a total &s;eparation between civil government and the protection or e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion, or
<PB N="15" REF="036380_0014_1008F6C61C2569F0">the advancement of a &s;piritual kingdom; and do even con&s;ider the former as having nothing to do with the latter. But, I beg leave to inquire, Whether the pro&s;perity and advancement of a kingdom of holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s among men, be not the great object of civil government? And, whether every civil con&s;titution, which is not ultimately calculated to nouri&s;h and cheri&s;h true religion, and &s;o to advance a &s;piritual and holy kingdom, be not, in the view of God, whatever it be in the view of man, not merely <HI>cen&s;urable,</HI> but ab&s;olutely <HI>abominable</HI>? Take a retro&s;pect of the antient di&s;pen&s;ations of God, and you will &s;ee, how God views civil governments and admini&s;trations in this re&s;pect. Is it not evident, from the pa&s;t di&s;|pen&s;ations of God, that he approved or cen&s;ured civil governments, according to the re&s;pect or di&s;|re&s;pect paid by them, to his church and the ad|vancement of a kingdom of holine&s;s? This was certainly the ca&s;e, re&s;pecting the admini&s;trations of the kings of I&s;rael. This was al&s;o the ca&s;e, re&s;|pecting the Chaldean monarchy. It is the very rea&s;on offered, why God brought ruin on that mighty empire. It was becau&s;e it rejoiced in the ruin, and was in&s;trumental in de&s;troying the heri|tage of God. The vengeance of God was, al&s;o, denounced upon the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> upon <HI>Moab</HI> and <HI>Seir,</HI> upon <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Egypt</HI> for their oppo&s;ition to and deri&s;ion of the church of God. We are, al&s;o, a&s;|&s;ured,
<PB N="16" REF="036380_0015_1008F6C7A4104108">that it will always be thus, that God will pull down kingdoms and utterly de&s;troy them, when they &s;tand in the way to the pro&s;perity and advancement of his church, or a kingdom of right|eou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT may here be &s;aid, that there are none, who &s;uppo&s;e, that civil government and admini&s;trations are to <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> the advancement of a &s;piritual king|dom, or the progre&s;s of religion; all which is con|tended for is, that civil government &s;hould be <HI>neu|tral.</HI> But, in an&s;wer, it may be a&s;ked, Whether it be po&s;&s;ible that civil government &s;hould take &s;uch a po&s;ition? Our Saviour a&s;&s;erts, "He that is not with me is again&s;t me: and he that gathereth not with me &s;cattereth abroad."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xii.30.</NOTE> There is according to the&s;e words of Chri&s;t, no &s;uch thing as neutral|ity. And this is as true, re&s;pecting civil govern|ment, as re&s;pecting an individual. A mere neglect to countenance and &s;upport religion, or a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s, in a civil admini&s;tration, will op|erate again&s;t it. It was always &s;uppo&s;ed of old, that the conduct of rulers, or their admini&s;trations, had a very great influence on the religious &s;tate and character of the Jews. It is impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, that civil government &s;hould take a neutral po&s;ition, re&s;pecting religion or a kingdom of holine&s;s. It
<PB N="17" REF="036380_0016_1008F6C9ED026E30">mu&s;t aid and countenance it, or it will di&s;courage and bring it into contempt.</P>
<P>WITHOUT attempting, particularly, to point out what aid or &s;upport civil government may and ought to give, to religion or the Church of Chri&s;t, I would only further ob&s;erve, that the &s;acred &s;crip|tures do teach, in a very direct manner, that civil government is de&s;igned by God, ultimately, as a mean and expedient to advance religion, or a king|dom of righteou&s;ne&s;s among men. Is it not di|rectly and po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted, by the prophet I&s;aiah, that in a future period, when civil government &s;hall be rightly applied and faithfully admini&s;tered, "Kings &s;hall be nur&s;ing fathers and their Queens nur&s;ing mothers," to the Church of God? And, does not the apo&s;tle Paul mo&s;t expre&s;sly teach us, what the end of civil government and magi&s;tracy is?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romans xiii.3&mdash;5.</NOTE> <Q><HI>Ru|lers are not a</HI> terror to good works, <HI>but</HI> to the evil. <HI>Do that which is</HI> good, <HI>and thou &s;halt have</HI> prai&s;e of the &s;ame, <HI>for he is the mini&s;ter of God to thee</HI> for good. <HI>He beareth not the</HI> &s;word in vain; <HI>for he is the mini&s;ter of God</HI>&mdash;a revenger to <HI>to execute</HI> wrath upon him that doeth evil.</Q> Does not this account of the de&s;ign of civil government and magi&s;tracy, clearly teach, that they were de&s;igned to encourage and &s;upport a kingdom of
<PB N="18" REF="036380_0017_1008F6CBEDCBB1A0">righteou&s;ne&s;s among men? And, the &s;ame apo&s;tle directs, "<HI>that prayers, interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of thanks be made&mdash;for</HI> kings <HI>and for</HI> all that are in au|thority, <HI>that we may lead quiet and peaceable lives,</HI> in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii.1, 2.</NOTE> It mu&s;t be clear, from what is &s;aid concerning the de&s;ign of civil government, in the &s;acred &s;criptures, that it was in&s;tituted as a mean, to advance and &s;upport a kingdom of holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s: And, therefore, it is one thing which &s;erves to point us, to the great object which God has in view in his government; or the nature and de&s;ign of his king|dom.</P>
<P>AGAIN; the u&s;e and improvement, which God requires us to make of the various allotments of his providence, farther point out the end of his government, or the nature of his kingdom; and that it is a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE improvement God requires us to make of providence is this, that we grow in righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s. The goodne&s;s of God is to lead us to repentance. Under adver&s;ities, we are to "learn righteou&s;ne&s;s." Or, to adopt the language of an apo&s;tle, when &s;peaking of trials and adver&s;ities, he &s;ays they are &s;ent "that we may be partakers of his holine&s;s." Now if our holine&s;s, be the end of
<PB N="19" REF="036380_0018_1008E3AE4216BAA0">divine allotments, it becomes evident, that the ad|vancement of a kingdom of holine&s;s, is the end of God's admini&s;trations.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame truth will appear with additional clear|ne&s;s, if we turn our attention, to the particular de&s;igns of God, and his providential di&s;pen&s;ations, as they are &s;tated in the &s;acred &s;criptures.</P>
<P>IF we take a view of events under the former di&s;pen&s;ation, we mu&s;t &s;ee, that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a holy and &s;piritual kingdom was, uniformly, the object which God had in view in all his allotments. It is evident, that his Church was kept con&s;tantly in view, as the chief object of attention. God &s;et up the Church as his great object. This appears, incontrovertibly true, not only relative to tho&s;e ad|mini&s;trations, which re&s;pected the Jews in particu|lar; but the affairs of all other nations, were &s;ub|ordinated to the pro&s;perity and advancement of the Church. Whole nations were exterminated and utterly de&s;troyed, as the pro&s;perity of the Church demanded. God conducted and di&s;po&s;ed, not only, of the affairs of the Jews, but of all the nations around them, with a direct and immediate refer|ence, to the enlargement and pro&s;perity of his Church. Of this, no one can doubt, who has at|tended to the hi&s;tory of God's proceedings, as they are &s;tated in his word. Which point us directly to
<PB N="20" REF="036380_0019_1008F6D1B7644C40">a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the object of God's government.</P>
<P>FARTHERMORE, the declarations and prophecies contained in the &s;acred &s;criptures, relative to the <HI>future</HI> di&s;pen&s;ations of God, point us to the &s;ame object.&mdash;They are all aimed at the advancement of a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the great object which God has in view.</P>
<P>GOD has actually decreed that all other kingdoms &s;hall come to an utter end&mdash;That his &s;piritual kingdom "&s;hall break in pieces and con&s;ume all other kingdoms, and it &s;hall &s;tand forever." And that, as the great Monarchies which have already exi&s;ted, have, one after another, been utterly de|&s;troyed, to make way for the enlargement of his Church, and the advancement of his &s;piritual king|dom, &s;o it &s;hall be hereafter. Although God may &s;uffer the powers of this world, to trample on his Church, for a &s;ea&s;on; yet He a&s;&s;ures us, that "the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it"&mdash;That he will &s;uffer the wrath and madne&s;s of men to pro|ceed no further, than &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary, to prepare the way for its e&s;tabli&s;hment. "The wrath of man &s;hall prai&s;e thee, the remainder of wrath wilt thou re&s;train." And, we are further a&s;&s;ured, that &s;uch will be the allotments or providence, and that the affairs of all nations &s;hall be &s;o over-ruled, as
<PB N="21" REF="036380_0020_1008F6D4F7DE9CC0">that, eventually, "The earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of the Lord"&mdash;That the corrupt pa&s;|&s;ions of men, which are naturally &s;o violent and overbearing, &s;hall be &s;oftened down, &s;o that noth|ing &s;hall hurt or de&s;troy, in all God's holy moun|tain&mdash;That all &s;hall know him "from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t."</P>
<P>HENCE it appears, that the great object, which God has kept in view, in former di&s;pen&s;ations, and which he will keep con&s;tantly in view in his future, is the advancement and e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;piritual and holy kingdom.</P>
<P>BUT one con&s;ideration more will be &s;ugge&s;ted, to &s;how that the end of the kingdom, which is the LORD's, is the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a kingdom of ho|line&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and that is the <HI>re&s;ult and final i&s;&s;ue</HI> of his admini&s;trations.</P>
<P>IN what the admini&s;trations of God, or the va|rious di&s;pen&s;ations of providence will end, we have full information in the &s;acred &s;criptures: and infor|mation can be derived from no other &s;ource. We are clearly informed, by the word of God, that one event after another &s;hall roll on, 'till all God's de&s;igns are completed&mdash;that in the end of the world, the whole number of the righteous &s;hall be gathered together, into one &s;ociety&mdash;that the wick|ed
<PB N="22" REF="036380_0021_1008F6D7F22CF498">&s;hall be &s;eparated from them, with every one that "loveth and maketh a lie." So that the righteous will form, a perfectly holy and pure &s;o|ciety.&mdash;We are further informed, from the oracles of God, that when all the righteous &s;hall be gath|ered in, from out of every nation under heaven, the ends and the purpo&s;es of God, in all preced|ing di&s;pen&s;ations, will be attained&mdash;that there will be no further employment for the kingdoms and na|tions of this world&mdash;that the wicked, although they have been improved as in&s;truments to accomplish the purpo&s;es of God, will be improved no longer; but will be turned down into de&s;truction, from which they will never be recovered&mdash;and, the ma|terial world, the earth with all its apparatus, which has &s;erved as a theatre on which the affairs of God's kingdom, while in an infantile &s;tate, have been tran&s;acted, (when the righteous are all gathered in,) will be of no further u&s;e; and, therefore, will be &s;ubjected to ab&s;olute de&s;truction.&mdash;"The heav|ens &s;hall be rolled together as a &s;croll," and "&s;hall pa&s;s away with a great noi&s;e: and the elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat."&mdash;National di&s;tinct|ions &s;hall be known no more&mdash;the &s;ceptres of kings and the &s;words of magi&s;trates &s;hall be laid a&s;ide&mdash;the &s;un &s;hall withdraw its &s;hining, and the moon will be turned into darkne&s;s&mdash;"the earth and the works that are therein &s;hall be burnt up;" and there will be no more remembrance of former
<PB N="23" REF="036380_0022_1008F6DA6378B428">things. The grand drama will then be clo&s;ed.&mdash;From a con&s;ideration of the final re&s;ult of things we learn, with the utmo&s;t certainty, that the ob|ject which God ever had in view was, the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of a kingdom of holine&s;s.</P>
<P>THUS the de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's incarnation&mdash;of re|ligious and civil in&s;titutions&mdash;the requirements made in the law of God, of moral and intelligent beings&mdash;the improvement to be made of providen|tial di&s;pen&s;ations;&mdash;together with the final re&s;ult or conclu&s;ion of things, when a holy and pure &s;ocie|ty &s;hall be formed and rendered triumphant; all the&s;e various con&s;iderations unite, in pointing out to us, that the great object of God's government is, the formation and e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;piritual and holy kingdom.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH &s;o much has already been &s;aid, con|cerning the kingdom which is the Lord's, one ob|&s;ervation more mu&s;t be added, which is, that the important ends and purpo&s;es of that kingdom, are to be &s;ecured, through the medium of the media|torial plan, and under the admini&s;tration of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as mediatorial king.</P>
<P>IN illu&s;tration of this truth I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the &s;acred &s;criptures very expre&s;sly teach us, that in con&s;equence of Chri&s;t's faithfulne&s;s, in ex|ecuting
<PB N="24" REF="036380_0023_1008F6DBF222B780">the work of redemption, God did inve&s;t him with kingly authority, and impowered him to call in and train up for glory, all tho&s;e that were given him. And the affairs of angels as well as of men were committed into his hands. Accordingly we read, that when Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed from the dead, God "&s;et him at his own right hand, in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but al&s;o in that which is to come: and hath put all things un|der his feet, and gave him to be HEAD over all things to the church."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;.i.20&mdash;22.</NOTE> And, in another place, concerning Chri&s;t it is &s;aid, "Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God, angels, authorities and powers being made &s;ubject to him."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Peter iii.22.</NOTE> We are further a&s;&s;ured, that in the cour&s;e of his government, he will "reconcile all things to him|&s;elf, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven." Which imports, that Chri&s;t will unite, in one &s;ociety, the &s;inle&s;s angels and elect men. The apo&s;tle Paul expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erts, that his king|dom will not be delivered up, 'till "he &s;hall have put down all rule, and all authority and power: for he mu&s;t reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet.&mdash;And, when all things &s;hall be &s;ubdued un|to him, then &s;hall the &s;on be al&s;o &s;ubject unto him, that put all things under him, that God may be all in all."</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="036380_0024_1008F6DE50EB0630">WITHOUT any comment on the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, thus much mu&s;t be evidently taught in them, that the great purpo&s;es of God in his univer&s;al government, in erecting and e&s;tabli&s;hing a kingdom of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, will be accompli&s;hed, under the reign and by the admini&s;tration of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as mediatorial king; or through the medium of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>FROM the foregoing ob&s;ervations it appears, that the kingdom which is the LORD's, is one which is <HI>univer&s;al</HI>&mdash;extending to <HI>all things</HI> throughout all worlds. The <HI>end</HI> of it is, to rai&s;e up and e&s;tabli&s;h a kingdom of perfect holine&s;s and happine&s;s&mdash;the great object is to be &s;ecured, under the reign and through the admini&s;tration of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as me|diatorial king. I now proceed,</P>
<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider, in what &s;en&s;e the kingdom may be &s;aid to be the LORD's, and that He is exalted as HEAD above all.</P>
<P>As great brevity will be ob&s;erved, in attending to this inquiry, as its importance will admit.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT may be proper to ob&s;erve, that &s;uch a&s;|criptions and acknowledgments, as tho&s;e contain|ed in our text, very frequently occur in the &s;acred &s;criptures.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="036380_0025_1008F6E22A92CDC0">THE pious p&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, "The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice, and the multitude of i&s;les be glad." Our Saviour, in that form of prayer which he gave his di&s;ciples, taught them always to pray, "<HI>Thy kingdom come:</HI>" and to conclude in this man|ner; "For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory." And he enjoined it on his di&s;ciples, to live in a firm <HI>belief</HI> of the <HI>agency</HI> of God, as being concerned in the mo&s;t minute events&mdash;that a &s;par|row does not fall to the ground, without their heav|enly Father.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE propriety of its being &s;aid in the text, that the kingdom is the LORD's, and that He is ex|alted as HEAD above all, appears from his being the <HI>maker,</HI> and &s;o the original <HI>owner</HI> and <HI>proprietor</HI> of all things.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;e, comprehending all worlds and creatures, owes its exi&s;tence to God. The highe&s;t archangel is as dependent on God, for being, as the meane&s;t in&s;ect. This being the ca&s;e, the king|dom is the Lord's. All the kingdoms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the earth are the. Lord's, as he rai&s;ed them up. Kings and magi&s;trates, and all who are in authority are the Lord's, as he has inve&s;ted them with all that power and authority which they po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is with propriety, that the kingdom is &s;aid to be the LORD's, and that He is exalted as HEAD
<PB N="27" REF="036380_0026_1008F6E3B3CF61C8">above all, as He is, mo&s;t certainly the <HI>rightful</HI> ru|ler and governor of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Lord, who made and upholds all things, has, certainly, an original right to di&s;po&s;e of them, according to his good plea&s;ure. He mu&s;t have a right to do what he will with his own. He mu&s;t have an original and exclu&s;ive right, to turn every wheel in government, and to a&s;certain every event, &s;o as to accompli&s;h his own purpo&s;es.</P>
<P N="4">4. I SHALL only ob&s;erve further, That the king|dom is the LORD's, and that He is exalted as HEAD above all, not only as he is the <HI>maker</HI> and <HI>proprietor</HI> of all, and &s;o has an original and independent <HI>right</HI> to reign; but as he does, in fact, exerci&s;e a government over the whole univer&s;e, comprehend|ing all creatures and all events.</P>
<P>INDEED, if God did not con&s;tantly exerci&s;e his Almighty power and &s;uperintending care over the univer&s;e, it would immediately cea&s;e to exi&s;t. That &s;ame power which <HI>created</HI> can, alone, <HI>uphold</HI> the things which are made. The ab&s;olute and con|&s;tant dependance of all things on God, renders it certain, that he mu&s;t be "exalted as head above all"&mdash;that he mu&s;t rule over the whole univer&s;e.</P>
<P>SOME have, indeed, repre&s;ented it as too tri|fling a bu&s;ine&s;s, for the Supreme Being, to concern
<PB N="28" REF="036380_0027_1008F6E78798E2A0">him&s;elf with the affairs of creatures; and, had ra|ther con&s;ider God, only as an unconcerned and unintere&s;ted &s;pectator of the affairs of the world.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uch may be a&s;ked, Why God did not con|&s;ider the <HI>creation</HI> of the univer&s;e as too trifling a bu&s;ine&s;s for him to undertake! If it be now be|neath his notice and care, it was beneath him to exerci&s;e his wi&s;dom in contriving, and his power in giving it exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>WE can hardly conceive it to be po&s;&s;ible, that God &s;hould bring &s;uch a univer&s;e into being&mdash;that he &s;hould construct &s;uch a complicated ma|chine as the natural world; and introduce into ex|i&s;tence, intelligent and moral beings, with capaci|ties for immortal happine&s;s, without propo&s;ing &s;ome important end in it. If God had an important end originally in view, we may be a&s;&s;ured, that he will concern him&s;elf, &s;o far, in the affairs of the univer&s;e, as to order and arrange events, in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;ecure it. Either God had or he had not an important end, in creating the univer&s;e. If he had not &s;ome important object in view, Why did he make the worlds which now exi&s;t? Was it for mere diver&s;ion and amu&s;ement! But, if he had a &s;ufficient end for <HI>creating</HI> there certainly mu&s;t be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on, for his exerci&s;ing a con&s;tant <HI>gov|ernment</HI> over the created univer&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="036380_0028_1008F6E5F75C1E80">THAT there is &s;o much <HI>apparent</HI> evil&mdash;&s;o much <HI>&s;eeming</HI> confu&s;ion&mdash;&s;o many <HI>jarring</HI> and <HI>my&s;terious</HI> events extant in the world, has &s;ometimes been con&s;idered, as a forcible objection to the &s;uppo&s;i|tion, that God is at the HEAD of all things, and exerci&s;es a univer&s;al government.&mdash;But it ought to be con&s;idered, that &s;hort-&s;ighted men, who are full of <HI>&s;inful bia&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,</HI> are very mi&s;e|rable judges, as to the events which are nece&s;&s;ary to take place; &s;o as to &s;ecure the welfare of a king|dom, which is as <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> as the <HI>univer&s;e,</HI> and as <HI>durable</HI> as <HI>eternity</HI> it&s;elf. The little concerns and exigencies of an earthly kingdom, or a petty &s;tate, yea of a family or an individual, often confound the wi&s;dom of men. The mo&s;t dark and my&s;teri|ous events are often found to be pregnant with the highe&s;t good. The little occurrence of Jo&s;eph's brethren &s;elling him into Egypt, was a dark and gloomy event, and foreboded great evil, in the view of Jacob; yet, eventually, it proved to be of the utmo&s;t importance.</P>
<P>BUT, whatever the ignorance, pride or vanity of man may &s;ugge&s;t, the &s;acred &s;criptures do a&s;|&s;ure us, that God does reign, and is particularly concerned in the production of all events&mdash;that cold and heat&mdash;&s;ummer and winter, rain and drought, feed-time and harve&s;t&mdash;health and &s;ick|ne&s;s&mdash;war and peace&mdash;good and evil; yea, all the
<PB N="30" REF="036380_0029_1008F6EBDCDFFF90">affairs of the natural and moral world, are under the government and control of God&mdash;that he rai&s;es up empires and pulls them down&mdash;creates kings and magi&s;trates and depo&s;es them, according to his &s;overeign plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>WE are taught very particularly, in the &s;acred &s;criptures, as appears from what has been &s;aid, that God di&s;po&s;es of nations and arranges all events, with a view to one object; and that is, The e&s;tab|li&s;hment of a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s; and that he will continue to do &s;o, till that kingdom &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed and rendered triumphant. Then his purpo&s;es will be an&s;wered&mdash;the drama will be fin|i&s;hed, and God will be all in all.</P>
<P>IT now only remains, to point out the u&s;e and improvement that may be made of the &s;ubject: which we have con&s;idered, in a few particular in|ferences and remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. As the kingdom is the LORD's, and He is ex|alted as HEAD above all, obligations to obedience and &s;ubjection to God, mu&s;t be univer&s;al.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be the incumbent duty, not only of tho&s;e, who are ranked in the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of men, and are bu&s;ied in the mo&s;t humble employments, to yield a univer&s;al obedience to the will of God; but
<PB N="31" REF="036380_0030_1008F6ED675C4758">obligations of the &s;ame nature, are incumbent on tho&s;e, who are exalted to places of the highe&s;t dignity and honor among men. They are equally under the government of God, and their obliga|tions to reverence and obey him, are, in kind, the &s;ame. Yea, the obligations on tho&s;e, who are in the higher walks of life are, in &s;ome re&s;pects, pe|culiarly enhanced. Their example will have a pe|culiar influence, on the conduct and morals of tho&s;e, who are in more humble &s;tations. Hence that demand of the prophet, "O heads <HI>of Jacob, and ye</HI> princes <HI>of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael; Is it not for</HI> you <HI>to know JUDGMENT.</HI>" Hence, al&s;o, that direc|tion of the p&s;almi&s;t, "<HI>Be wi&s;e now, therefore,</HI> O ye kings, <HI>be in&s;tructed,</HI> O ye judges <HI>of the earth</HI>; &s;erve the Lord with fear and rejoice with <HI>trembling. Ki&s;s the &s;on le&s;t he be angry and ye peri&s;h from the way.</HI>"</P>
<P N="2">2. Is the kingdom the Lord's, and is He "ex|alted as Head above all, We &s;ee, that we have a &s;table and unfailing &s;ource of comfort, in the mo&s;t dark and gloomy times, and amid&s;t the changes and revolutions which take place, in the rotation of events, re&s;pecting the pre&s;ent world.</P>
<P>IF clouds and darkne&s;s &s;urround our nation&mdash;if foreign powers threaten us from without&mdash;if con|vul&s;ions and civil di&s;&s;entions do exi&s;t within&mdash;if
<PB N="32" REF="036380_0031_1008F6EFCC7C6940">vice, immorality and the mo&s;t outrageous wicked|edne&s;s do prevail, far and wide in the earth; yet the con&s;ideration, that the kingdom is the LORD's, and that He is exalted as HEAD above all, affords the mo&s;t ample &s;upport, and lays a foundation for the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial peace. God is both able and fully determined, to e&s;tabli&s;h his kingdom.</P>
<P>WE live in a day of mighty revolutions. Great events are rolling on in quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and pre|&s;age &s;ome great and intere&s;ting changes in the &s;tate of this world. The prophet Jeremiah demands, in the language of &s;urpri&s;e, "Hath a nation changed their Gods, which are yet no Gods!" as if it were an unheard of affair, that a nation had laid a&s;ide its fal&s;e Gods. But we live in a day, when a powerful nation, which had ranked it&s;elf among tho&s;e, who acknowledge the true and living God, has ab&s;olutely rejected and di&s;owned Him, and even proceeded to aboli&s;h the ordinances of heaven! "The my&s;tery of iniquity," as the apo&s;|tle expre&s;&s;es it, "doth already work." A deep concerted plan to &s;pread infidelity far and wide&mdash;to &s;ubvert religion and undermine government&mdash;to give to the lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of men full &s;cope, has been propagated among the nations of Europe, with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s. Its bitter con&s;equences and baneful influence have already produced, "di&s;|tre&s;s of nations, with perplexity," and even
<PB N="33" REF="036380_0032_1008F6F1945F4178">threaten to &s;hake all Europe, to its very center. The effects of it have not been limited to Europe, A&s;ia and Africa feel its bitter con&s;equences. And even in America, the leaven has begun to ferment, and is, mo&s;t probably, the <HI>&s;ource</HI> of the oppo&s;ition which has been, to the admini&s;tration of our na|tional government&mdash;but we have a &s;ub&s;tantial and unfailing &s;ource of con&s;olation, under all tho&s;e gloomy appearances&mdash;the kingdom is the Lord's.</P>
<P>INDEED, were we to have our views directed by the prophetic declarations, contained in the &s;acred &s;criptures, we &s;hould be led to expect, in&s;tead of being &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;uch events. Amid&s;t the confu&s;ion, and infidelity of the pre&s;ent day, we &s;ee, that the man of &s;in is in a mea&s;ure de&s;troyed; and that the papal hierarchy is crumbling into pieces. Nor are we to expect that the &s;cenes of di&s;|tre&s;s, which are now experienced in Europe, will terminate, till &s;omething &s;till more important is produced. The clouds appear to be gathering and preparations are making, for &s;cenes far more exten&s;ively di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, than tho&s;e which have been, as yet, realized.&mdash;But God reigns&mdash;the kingdom is his. He will take care of it. Neither earth nor hell can prevail again&s;t Him&mdash;the wrath of man &s;hall prai&s;e him, the remainder of wrath will he re&s;train.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="34" REF="036380_0033_1008F6F4AF112608">3. FROM the ob&s;ervations which have been made, we are led to &s;ee the important nature of the in&s;titution of civil government.</P>
<P>THE kingdom is the Lord's; and all the in&s;titu|tions which God has made, as well as all the events which take place, have a reference to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s?&mdash;are de&s;igned, by God, as means of accompli&s;hing and perfecting &s;o important a purpo&s;e. I do not &s;ay, that this is the object which mankind have had in view, in forming civil con&s;titutions and qualifying governments. Nothing, perhaps, has been further out of view. They have, probably, for the mo&s;t part been dictated by worldly views and motives. But God has in&s;tituted it, as one mean and expe|dient, to advance the progre&s;s of a &s;piritual king|dom. This gives the in&s;titution of civil govern|ment, an a&s;pect of great con&s;equence. It teaches us, that it was not contrived, merely to exalt &s;ome men over the heads of others; or to &s;ecure to the members of &s;ociety, an equal enjoyment of privi|leges of a worldly nature; or, merely, to protect life and property; but it has a further reach and more important de&s;ign. It is nothing le&s;s, than one of the expedients which the Supreme Governor of the world has adopted, to forward the great and important purpo&s;es of e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;piritual king|dom. Viewed in any other point of light, it dwin|dles
<PB N="35" REF="036380_0034_1008F6F7F2696158">into nothing, in point of con&s;equence and im|portance.</P>
<P>I AM not in&s;en&s;ible, that writers on civil govern|ment, have generally con&s;idered it, as a mean to &s;ecure the peace and welfare of &s;ociety in this world; and as having no concern with or reference to a &s;piritual kingdom. But can it be &s;o, that in the in&s;titution of civil government, which has &s;uch prodigious influence on the &s;tate of this world, the Supreme Being has forgotten the great object he has in view in his government! Mu&s;t civil govern|ment be con&s;idered, as a &s;olitary exception, as to its de&s;ign, from all the works and other in&s;titutions of God! Can we &s;uppo&s;e, that God would build up and pull down kingdoms, on account of their influence and tendency, to build up or ob&s;truct the progre&s;s of religion, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s, if civil government were not de&s;igned as a mean to advance and promote them?</P>
<P>WERE it not for the treaty of peace which God is now carrying on, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, civil government and earthly kingdoms would be utterly aboli&s;hed: and the whole material world would be de&s;troyed. The advancement and progre&s;s of that treaty, is the end of all God's admini&s;trations. Hence we find, that when civil government is right|ly
<PB N="36" REF="036380_0035_1008F6F9819695F0">applied and admini&s;tered, kings will be nur&s;ing fathers and their queens will be nur&s;ing mothers to the Church of God. In this view of the de&s;ign of civil government, it appears to be an in&s;titution of great con&s;equence.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE are naturally to conclude, from what has been &s;aid, that &s;uch men as have <HI>fixed moral</HI> and <HI>religious principles,</HI> are the only characters which can, with any propriety, be elected into offices of tru&s;t, to direct the affairs and concerns of civil government.</P>
<P>THIS inference is fairly deducible, from the de|&s;ign of civil government. If civil government be de&s;igned, as an hand-maid to religion&mdash;as a mean to advance and forward a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s, it mu&s;t be important, that tho&s;e, who are elected into civil office, and e&s;pecially into the principal offices of government, &s;hould be <HI>friends</HI> to the cau&s;e; and &s;o, men of <HI>fixed</HI> and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed moral</HI> and <HI>religious principles.</HI> Yea, may we not proceed &s;o far as to &s;ay, that they &s;hould be firm believers in chri&s;tianity? For the kingdom which God is rai&s;ing up among men, is founded on the <HI>chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem</HI>; and is to be advanced, under the reign of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as mediatorial king. That &s;uch char|acters alone are to be &s;ought and elected into pla|ces of tru&s;t, in a civil government, is not only
<PB N="37" REF="036380_0036_1008F6FBC870DF98">dictated by the de&s;ign of the in&s;titution; but is en|joined by God. "Thou &s;halt provide out of all the people, able men, &s;uch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetou&s;ne&s;s," &amp;c. men of no other de&s;cription are friendly, to the real end of civil government.</P>
<P>THE <HI>liberalizing</HI> &s;pirit of the pre&s;ent day (which looks with <HI>indifferency</HI> and <HI>patience,</HI> on every thing, excepting &s;trict religion and fervent piety,) I am aware, inculcates a different doctrine. Such as are under its influence will tell us, that moral and religious principles are of no importance; yea, it is a di&s;covery made by the modern <HI>Illuminati,</HI> that both religion and government are enemies to the happi|ne&s;s of mankind. Hence it is, that exten&s;ive com|binations have been formed, and unwearied efforts made, to overturn religious and moral &s;y&s;tems, as well as to unhinge and &s;ubvert civil con&s;titutions and governments. But, it happens fortunately, that what may be expected, from a government admini&s;tered by men, who are void of <HI>moral princi|ples,</HI> and are plunged deep into <HI>infidelity,</HI> has been &s;o openly exemplified. When moral feel|ings and religious re&s;traints are eradicated, and God is not acknowledged and reverenced, the bar|riers again&s;t the mo&s;t atrocious wickedne&s;s are re|moved, and the lu&s;ts of the human heart will be unre&s;trained. With men of &s;uch a character at
<PB N="38" REF="036380_0037_1008F6FE1542EEA0">the head of government, we could hardly expect any thing el&s;e, than that the rights of men &s;hould be trampled on&mdash;the laws of humanity be &s;ported with, and an ambition prevail, which knows no bounds.&mdash;All this we &s;ee exemplified in Europe, at the pre&s;ent time. No more &s;triking picture can be given, of the baleful influence and effects of infi|delity, when dictating the mea&s;ures of government, than are exhibited in the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the revolution in France. When we review the vari|ous mea&s;ures which have been adopted&mdash;what riv|ers of blood have been &s;pilt&mdash;with what coolne&s;s and deliberation the lives of the old, the young and the innocent babe have been de&s;poiled&mdash;the prop|erty of &s;ubjects &s;eized&mdash;the boundle&s;s ambition and in&s;atiable thir&s;t for domination which has prevailed &mdash;the piracies which have been committed on the &s;eas&mdash;and the in&s;idious and wicked policy which has been practi&s;ed, re&s;pecting other nations; or to &s;um up the whole in a word, when we behold a nation, once famous for its civility and poli&s;hed manners, changed into a nation of barbarians; I &s;ay, when we &s;ee the&s;e things actually exi&s;ting, and can be accounted for in no way, unle&s;s from the influence of <HI>infidelity,</HI> Can we need any thing further, to teach us the importance of placing men of <HI>fixed moral</HI> and <HI>religious &s;entiments,</HI> at the head of government? The Supreme Governor of the world, has de&s;ignedly given the nations of the
<PB N="39" REF="036380_0038_1008F7017606FE60">earth, a &s;triking picture and example of the bane|ful influence and ruining tendency of infidelity. And, no nation which, after this &s;olemn warning and admonition, &s;hall act the &s;ame part, by com|mitting the management of the concerns of &s;ociety, into the hands of <HI>infidels,</HI> or of men who&s;e <HI>feelings</HI> are <HI>loo&s;e</HI> and <HI>unhinged,</HI> re&s;pecting religion and mo|rality, can expect le&s;s, than to &s;hare, in a higher or lower degree, in the &s;ame plagues.</P>
<P>THERE can hardly be a greater incon&s;i&s;tency, than for a chri&s;tian people, to appoint &s;uch men, as the guardians of their rights, and as nur&s;es to the Church of God, who have not fixed moral and religious principles; and, who are nearly afloat re|specting chri&s;tianity in every view of it.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE &s;ubject, which we have been con&s;idering and illu&s;trating, is of u&s;e, and may be particularly improved, by civil rulers and legi&s;lators.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH they are placed at the head of gov|ernment, and have authority to enact laws, to reg|ulate the community over which they are placed; yet, they are to con&s;ider, that there is a higher power, which pre&s;ides over and controls the af|fairs of men. The kingdom is the LORD's, and He is exalted as HEAD above ALL. Civil rulers and legi&s;lators are but <HI>&s;ervants</HI> or <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> of God.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="036380_0039_1008F70305AD6A38">Their work is a&s;&s;igned them by Him. They are &s;ervants, rai&s;ed up by God, to forward the great object of his government, in forming and e&s;tabli&s;h|ing a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s. At the &s;ame time therefore, they are framing laws, for the &s;e|curity of the lives and properties of their con&s;titu|ents, and for the equal admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, they are not only to be cautious, that they do <HI>no harm</HI> to religion and the Church of God, but to be careful to do every thing, in their power, to countenance and &s;upport them.</P>
<P>IT is not pretended, that civil rulers and legi&s;la|tors have a right, ab&s;olutely and authoritatively to impo&s;e <HI>creeds</HI> and <HI>confe&s;&s;ions of faith</HI>; yet, mo&s;t cer|tainly, it mu&s;t be incumbent on them, in all the mea&s;ures they adopt, to manife&s;t a governing re|gard for God and the intere&s;ts of his kingdom. It mu&s;t be their indi&s;pen&s;ible duty, to adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures, as will, mo&s;t directly, encourage and promote, the progre&s;s of that treaty of peace and reconciliation, which God is carrying on with men.</P>
<P>IT is in the power of civil rulers, in many re&s;pects, to prepare the way, for an advantageous tender of &s;alvation to mankind. They may &s;et up their ban|ners again&s;t vice&mdash;encourage men of religion and virtue, and &s;upport the in&s;titutions of Chri&s;tianity.&mdash;
<PB N="41" REF="036380_0040_1008F705CDC4F6A0">Many of the &s;ubordinate officers of government are appointed, by the legi&s;lature. If men of vir|tue, who are profe&s;&s;ed friends to the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;|tem, as well as of good government, were di&s;tin|gui&s;hed as objects of particular favor; and if, on the contrary, the profane&mdash;the de&s;pi&s;ers of religion and fervent piety, and tho&s;e who neglect religious in&s;titutions were rejected, it would, certainly, be a worthy te&s;timony of regard to the kingdom of God; and an encouragement to men to do well.</P>
<P>DISSOLUTENESS of manners, if not a contempt of chri&s;tianity has been, within a few years, great|ly increa&s;ing. It would be very unhappy, indeed, if tho&s;e, who are di&s;tingui&s;hed as rulers and legi&s;|lators, &s;hould be wanting, in their exertions, to &s;tem their progre&s;s; but above all &s;o; if they, by their example, &s;hould countenance them.&mdash;The in|fluence of rulers is great and exten&s;ive; although they are often the objects, at which the &s;hafts of en|vy and malice are levelled. Their &s;tation re&s;pec|ting religion and virtue cannot be neutral. Their tran&s;actions and examples will, nece&s;&s;arily, have an exten&s;ive influence.</P>
<P>THE people, in this &s;tate, have rea&s;on to be very thankful that the Supreme Ruler of the world has given them &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of rulers,
<PB N="42" REF="036380_0041_1008F70810863D68">as have, not only been firm friends to their civil rights, but have been di&s;po&s;ed to encourage the cau&s;e of religion and virtue.&mdash;And it is no &s;mall occa&s;ion of joy to the friends of Zion, that the late legislature of this &s;tate, while the zealous ad|vocates for religion, in England and Scotland, have provided mi&s;&s;ionaries, to &s;ound the glad ti|dings of &s;alvation in Africa, in the Ea&s;t-Indies and in the i&s;lands of the Pacific ocean, have adopted mea&s;ures, to make provi&s;ion, for the preaching of the go&s;pel among the new &s;ettlements, in this country; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to chri&s;tianize the heathen nations.</P>
<P>AS the kingdom is the Lord's, we may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, that he will take care of it; whether earthly powers nouri&s;h and cheri&s;h, or neglect and abandon it. It will certainly flouri&s;h and finally triumph. Yet, let it be remembered, that tho&s;e who are rai&s;ed to places of tru&s;t and influence, as well as tho&s;e in private life, mu&s;t, finally, give up a mo&s;t &s;olemn account to HIM, who is exalted as HEAD above all.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE &s;ubject which we have had under con&s;id|eration, may be improved, to <HI>animate</HI> and <HI>encourage</HI> the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="036380_0042_1008F70B6A58F528">THE mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t are officers in the king|dom of the Lord; and their direct bu&s;ine&s;s is, to be "workers together with him." They are &s;ent out, purpo&s;ely, to explain the nature of God's kingdom&mdash;to plead its cau&s;e among men, and to per&s;uade them to inli&s;t as &s;ubjects in it. The king|doms of this world are to be managed by other hands. Mini&s;ters are, by office, to exert them|&s;elves, in endeavouring to build up and e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;piritual kingdom. And, &s;ince God is at the head of it, what encouragements have mini&s;ters to be zealous and active? Did &s;ucce&s;s depend, merely on their &s;trength and efforts; and had they not rea|&s;on to expect the interpo&s;ition of no higher power, they might well be di&s;couraged. But the kingdom is the LORD's. He will &s;ucceed and pro&s;per its ad|vancement. He is, at this time, mo&s;t evidently di&s;po&s;ing of the affairs of earthly kingdoms, &s;o as to prepare the way for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his own kingdom. He has given the mo&s;t ab&s;olute a&s;&s;u|rance in his word, that all the evils which are ex|tant&mdash;the di&s;tre&s;s and revolution of nations, &s;hall con&s;pire to advance a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s; however gloomy it may appear to &s;hort-&s;ighted men&mdash;that one event &s;hall roll on after another, till all God's de&s;igns are accompli&s;hed.
