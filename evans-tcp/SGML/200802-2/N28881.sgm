<Q><HI>AND I will give children to be their princes, and babes &s;hall rule over them. And the people &s;hall be oppre&s;|&s;ed, every one by another, and every one by his neigh|bour: the child &s;hall behave him&s;elf proudly again&s;t the ancient, and the ba&s;e again&s;t the honorable.</HI></Q>

<PB N="6" REF="038509_0005_10122C00224888F8">
neither pa&s;t mercies, nor pre&s;ent happy circum|&s;tances, are any &s;ecurity again&s;t evils to come. Surpri&s;ing changes in this fallen world, have ever been frequent, and are &s;till to be expected. Pro&s;|perity and adver&s;ity, like &s;un&s;hine and &s;torms, are wont to follow each other, almo&s;t in con&s;tant rotation. Communities, as well as individuals, that have been remarkably rai&s;ed up, are often as wonderfully ca&s;t down, in the providence of God, when mo&s;t exalted. "He ble&s;&s;eth them al&s;o," it is &s;aid,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cvii. 38, 39.</NOTE> "&s;o that they are multiplied greatly, and &s;uffereth not their cattle to decrea&s;e. Again they are mini&s;hed, and brought low, through oppre&s;&s;ion, affliction and &s;orrow."</P>
<P>OF &s;uch vici&s;&s;itudes, the cho&s;en people threatened in our text, was a &s;triking and an in&s;tructive exam|ple. This nation had long been favored, in regard to government, as well as religion, far beyond any other then on the earth. From its earlie&s;t infancy, it had been under the peculiar guardian&s;hip of heav|en. "When I&s;rael was a child," &s;ays the mo&s;t High in Ho&s;ea,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. xi. 1&mdash;4.</NOTE> "then I loved him, and called my &s;on out of Egypt:&mdash;I taught Ephraim al&s;o to go, taking them by their arms: I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that take off the yoke."</P>
<P>THEY had been liberated from powerful oppre&s;|&s;ors, and cruel ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, by the out-&s;tretched
<PB N="7" REF="038509_0006_10122C01AFBC94C0">
arm of the <HI>Almighty.</HI> They had been led like a flock, through the Red Sea, and forty years in a mo&s;t per|ilous, howling wilderne&s;s, by the hand of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron.</HI> Under <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> their great and beloved general, they had vanqui&s;hed mighty armies; and had obtained a peaceful &s;ettlement as a free and an independent people, in a land flowing with milk and honey.</P>
<P>HERE, when they forgat God their Saviour, who had done &s;uch great things for them, and &s;o many wonderous works before their eyes, he &s;ometimes left them to have no guide, over&s;eer or ruler; and &s;uffered the Heathen around them, to make terri|ble inroads on their borders. Neverthele&s;s, as often as they cried unto the Lord in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, he rai&s;ed them up judges&mdash;valiant, righteous men, to deliver them out of the hand of their enemies, and to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice among them. Afterwards, becau&s;e of their unea&s;ine&s;s, and the hardne&s;s of their hearts, God gave them kings; and the&s;e, &s;ev|eral of them, were very eminent for wi&s;dom and virtue. Nor was their happine&s;s, in this re&s;pect, yet at an end; for I&s;aiah prophe&s;ied no later than the reign of Hezekiah; one of the mo&s;t amiable and be&s;t of princes.</P>
<P>BUT, from the days of their fathers, they had gone away from God's ordinances; and now, it &s;eems, the mea&s;ure of their iniquities was almo&s;t full. A very awful decree of the holy One of I&s;|rael again&s;t them is therefore here announced. See
<PB N="8" REF="038509_0007_10122C03C8F15A38">
the preceding context. "For, behold, the Lord, the Lord of ho&s;ts, doth take away from Jeru&s;alem, and from Judah, the &s;tay and the &s;taff; the whole &s;tay of bread, and the whole &s;tay of water; the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient; the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the coun&s;ellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. <HI>And I will give children to be their princes,"</HI> &amp; <HI>c.</HI></P>
<P>FROM my text, thus connected, the doctrine de|ducible, which will be our pre&s;ent &s;ubject, is this:</P>
<P><HI>THAT to be under a weak government, is one of the greate&s;t calamities, ever &s;ent upon a people.</HI></P>
<P>THIS, you ob&s;erve, is here threatened together with drouth and famine in the extreme&mdash;a total want of bread and of water; as well as being be|reaved of the mo&s;t eminent men, in every nece&s;&s;a|ry employment: and it is mentioned la&s;t, and mo&s;t enlarged upon, as the con&s;ummation of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>BUT, after explaining the calamity de&s;igned, and &s;ome of the principal cau&s;es of it, I &s;hall attend, more particularly, to the proof and illu&s;tration of this doctrine.</P>
<P>THERE are two &s;en&s;es, in which government is &s;aid to be weak: when it is <HI>unwi&s;e;</HI> and when it <HI>wants energy.</HI> The latter is the more exten&s;ive &s;ig|nification
<PB N="9" REF="038509_0008_10122C05DFA0C958">
of the phra&s;e; and it comprehends the former: this, therefore, is the &s;en&s;e now to be con|&s;idered. By a weak government will be meant, one that wants energy; whether through the weak|ne&s;s of tho&s;e by whom it is admini&s;tered, or by any other means.</P>
<P>To mention, with a little enlargement, &s;ome of the mo&s;t common cau&s;es of &s;o great an evil, will not be foreign to the de&s;ign of this anniver&s;ary.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the government of a nation or &s;tate has not proper energy, may be the fault of its con&s;ti|tution. A form of government may be &s;uch, that, unle&s;s the admini&s;tration of it be arbitrary, it will nece&s;&s;arily be weak.</P>
<P>To give rulers all that power, and re&s;erve to the &s;ubjects all that liberty, which is be&s;t for the peo|ple, is a nice point; very difficult, I imagine, to be axactly hit, by the wi&s;e&s;t of men, and men the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted. There is danger of erring, undoubtedly, on either hand; of abridging fre|dom, as well as of limiting authority, more than is for the greate&s;t general good&mdash;of adopting a con|&s;titution too de&s;potic, as well as one too feeble. But when it is left to the people at large, what govern|ment they will be under, the error mo&s;t to be appre|hended, I believe, is on the &s;ide of inefficiency.</P>
<P>THE love of liberty is natural to all mankind;
<PB N="10" REF="038509_0009_10122C07F7822CB0">
and even to birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things. Of this celebrated virtue, we lo&s;t nothing by the fall of our fir&s;t parents. Every one, however depraved in other re&s;pects, wi&s;hes to be free&mdash;unboundedly free; to have none above him; to be his own &s;ubject, his own governor, his own judge. And when, for obtaining the advantages of &s;ocial union, individuals give up to the commu|nity, or to any con&s;tituted authorities, a power over their words and actions, their property and lives; they do it with great reluctance, and as &s;paringly as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>To ob&s;erve the extreme reluctance of &s;ome, OR &s;uch occa&s;ions&mdash;to &s;ee how &s;trenuou&s;ly they will di&s;pute every inch of power, ve&s;ted any where, which might po&s;&s;ibly be abu&s;ed, or turned again&s;t them&s;elves; is apt to remind one of the cautious policy of certain ancient Pagans, de&s;cribed by Jer|emiah, in regard to their gods. Not only would they have gods of their own making, and made of &s;uch materials that they mu&s;t needs be born, becau&s;e they could not go; but, as wooden gods could fall and might happen to fall upon the makers of them, or on their children, or valuable furniture; for full &s;e|curity, they <HI>fa&s;tened them with nails and with ham|mers.</HI> "Be not afraid of them," &s;ays the proph|et; "for they cannot do evil; neither al&s;o is it in them to do good."</P>
<P>CHECKS, unque&s;tionably, there ought to be, on every department of a free government: But if
<PB N="11" REF="038509_0010_10122C0A1C061668">
&s;uch checks be laid upon rulers, that the ruled are under no check at all, harmle&s;s, indeed, will &s;uch rulers be; but altogether in&s;ignificant. The&s;e <HI>&s;er|vants of the people,</HI> mu&s;t have more power than the <HI>child,</HI> and the <HI>ba&s;e,</HI> who <HI>proudly</HI> &s;o call them; un|le&s;s we would have them mi&s;erable <HI>gods,</HI> or <HI>mini&s;ters of God to us for good</HI>&mdash;their &s;cripture titles. They mu&s;t have authority to puni&s;h trea&s;onable lies a|gain&s;t them&s;elves, as well as &s;landers again&s;t the meane&s;t of their &s;ubjects; otherwi&s;e, who will be afraid of them? Or what protection can they af|ford?</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT the government of a people is too weak, may be the fault of tho&s;e betru&s;ted with its admini&s;tration. It may be owing to their <HI>weakne&s;s;</HI> or to their <HI>indolence,</HI> or &s;lowne&s;s in doing bu&s;ine&s;s; or to their exce&s;&s;ive <HI>lenity;</HI> or to their not being of a virtuous character, or not paying a due attention to the &s;trict regularity of their own lives. The&s;e particulars, &s;uffer me cur&s;orily to go over.</P>
<P>WHEN the rulers of a land are children; wheth|er in under&s;tanding, or in firmne&s;s and &s;tability of mind, we are not certainly to expect that the reins of government will be guided with di&s;cretion, and held with &s;ufficient force. To govern well, at lea&s;t in the higher and more difficult offices, con&s;idera|ble theoretic knowledge, &s;ome experience, and more than common natural powers, are altogether nece&s;&s;ary. And &s;o is that degree of courage and inflexibility, which will enable a man to maintain
<PB N="12" REF="038509_0011_10122C0BABB92D20">
his po&s;t, and to per&s;evere in what appears to him the plain path of duty; unmoved by noi&s;y oppo&s;i|tion&mdash;undaunted by popular clamor&mdash;undi&s;mayed by imminent danger.</P>
<P>To &s;upport an efficient government, rulers mu&s;t likewi&s;e be men of vigilance and activity. "He that ruleth," &s;ays an Apo&s;tle,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 8.</NOTE> <HI>"with diligence."</HI> And of Jeroboam it was &s;aid,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Kings XI. 28.</NOTE> "Solomon, &s;eeing the young man that he was <HI>indu&s;trious,</HI> he made him ruler over all the charge of the hou&s;e of Jo|&s;eph". A commonwealth, under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uperinten|dency of indolent men, will re&s;emble the field of the &s;lothful which we read of, that was "all grown over with thorns; the face of it covered with net|tles, and the &s;tone wall thereof broken down". Or, though rulers be not "&s;lothful in bu&s;ine&s;s;" they may be &s;o &s;low in tran&s;acting it, and in bring|ing any thing to a termination, as very much to lower the tone, and defeat the &s;alutary de&s;igns, of civil government. When courts of ju&s;tice are &s;o dilatory in their deci&s;ions, and &s;uch endle&s;s eva|&s;ions, and reviews, are admitted; that a man had better lo&s;e almo&s;t any debt or damage, than com|mence a legal proce&s;s for a recovery, the protection of law mu&s;t be lamentably weak.</P>
<P>EXCESSIVE lenity, will have a &s;imilar effect. Mercy, is indeed an amiable attribute; to pa&s;s over a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, is &s;aid to be the glory of a man;
<PB N="13" REF="038509_0012_10122C0DD8E83880">
and being ready to forgive, is a duty much inculca|ted in the word of God: But in one who &s;u&s;tains any place of authority, whether that of a parent, or ma&s;ter, or civil magi&s;trate; lenity and indul|gence may be carried farther than is the glory o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> duty of a man; unle&s;s it be his duty and glory to&punc; have no government. Should rulers remit crimes, or pa&s;s them over without condemnation, when the public good, or righting an injured individual, re|quires their puni&s;hment; merciful they might be, but not as our Father in Heaven is merciful.</P>
<P>LIBERALITY to the poor, out of one's own pro|per goods, is a capital chri&s;tian virtue; but of the property of other people, judges and law-givers, may po&s;&s;ibly be over liberal. The per&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> even of the poor, are not to be re&s;pected in judgment. Making provi&s;ion by law, for &s;upporting &s;uch as are unable to &s;upport them&s;elves, is doubtle&s;s very com|mendable; but why tho&s;e who happen to be the creditors of the poor; who have helped them much already, and &s;uffered much by their &s;lackne&s;s and breach of promi&s;e, &s;hould be &s;till obliged to lo&s;e ten times more for their relief, or for the relief of their families, than others equally able, it is not ea&s;y to conceive. And &s;hould courts of law, or courts of equity, cancel the debts of men, when|ever they plead a pre&s;ent incapacity to pay them, whether &s;uch clemency might not too much weaken government, as a &s;ecurity to every one in his right|ful claims, may be a que&s;tion. Indeed, in any ca&s;e, to give an in&s;olvent debtor a <HI>final</HI> di&s;charge from all
<PB N="14" REF="038509_0013_10122C1120FFF7B0">
he owes, without the con&s;ent of his creditors, looks like giving him a licence to be an unrighteous man. For can it ever be right, or can any court under heaven make it right, for a man not to pay his promi&s;ed debts, for value received, when <HI>now</HI> he has money enough, becau&s;e <HI>once,</HI> the payment of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> was not in the power of his hands.</P>
<P>THUS to exonerate of a heavy load of old debts, one deeply in&s;olvent, is nece&s;&s;ary, it will be &s;aid; as without this he could have no courage to com|mence bu&s;ine&s;s anew. And, no doubt, &s;uch ex|pected exoneration, will be a mighty encourage|ment to extravagant adventurers, who have noth|ing to lo&s;e, &s;ince, by running the greate&s;t hazards, with the &s;lendere&s;t chance of immen&s;e gain, they ri&s;k only the property of others. If &s;ucce&s;sful, the profit is their own; if un&s;ucce&s;sful, the lo&s;s is their neighbour's. But if the tendency of being thus merciful, were much better than it is; or the ur|gency for it far greater; would it not be doing evil that good may come. "He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xxiii. 3.</NOTE> The laws of truth and righteou&s;|ne&s;s, are not no&s;es of wax; to be bent any way, as will &s;uit pre&s;ent convenience. It is dangerous to break down, or break over, the fixed barrier of eternal ju&s;tice, on any pretence of temporary nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>ONE way more was hinted, in which tho&s;e who govern, may weaken government; and that is, by
<PB N="15" REF="038509_0014_10122C12B0092268">
being men of a vicious character; or by not pay|ing a due attention to the &s;trict regularity of their own lives. Indeed, "a wicked ruler" is often &s;trong, and fierce, and active, as "a roaring lion and a ranging bear;" but rarely for the benefit of "the poor people." He will not be eager to pluck the &s;poil out of the mouth of the fraudulent villain, or the violent oppre&s;&s;or; unle&s;s that he may get it into his own. Nor will authority, in the hands of liber|tine men, however it may terrify, be much revered. When the makers or judges of laws, are them&s;elves notorious breakers of them, or of the laws of heav|en, government will nece&s;&s;arily fall into contempt. It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that advancing to po&s;ts of honor, men of loo&s;e principles and morals, gives reputation to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;tamps it as the current fa&s;hion. Their example will encourage evil doers, more than all the puni&s;hments they are likely to inflict, will be a terror to them. "The wicked walk on every &s;ide when the vile&s;t men are exalted."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xii. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT rulers may be far from being the <HI>vile&s;t</HI> men, they may be very good men; and yet, by an incau|tious conformity to common practices, &s;uppo&s;ed to be innocent, they may too much countenance &s;ome things which are of very hurtful tendency. Per|mit me to in&s;tance in one particular. "It is not for kings," we read, "to drink wine, nor for princes &s;trong drink."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxxi. 4.</NOTE> And certainly, it is not for
<PB N="16" REF="038509_0015_10122C144DC36C18">
the lower cla&s;&s;es to drink &s;o much of the&s;e as many of them do, if they regard their <HI>health,</HI> or <HI>compe|tence,</HI> or <HI>peace.</HI> I &s;elect this in&s;tance, becau&s;e it is directly pertinent to the main &s;ubject in hand. Nothing is a greater weakener of government&mdash;nothing makes the multitude more heady and high-minded&mdash;nothing rai&s;es oftener or louder, the cry of <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>equality</HI>&mdash;nothing more emboldens and inflames that little member, which boa&s;teth great things, and &s;etteth on fire the whole cour&s;e of na|ture&mdash;nothing, in a word, makes men more inca|pable of governing them&s;elves, or of being govern|ed, than <HI>&s;trong drink.</HI> Now, if rulers drink, though not to drunkenne&s;s; not &s;o as quite to "forget the law," or greatly to "pervert the judgment of any;" if they only drink as much as is very univer&s;ally cu&s;tomary, in polite circles, on great occa&s;ions; though they do not hurt them&s;elves, they may too much &s;anction that which will hurt their inferiors. That divine injunction, "Thou &s;halt not follow a multitude to do evil,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxiii. 2.</NOTE> lies with peculiar weight on civil rulers, as well as religious teachers. They, more than others, are under obligation to <HI>lead</HI> the multitude, in what&s;oever things are &s;ober, wife and good. They, of all men, are bound in duty to ab|&s;tain from all appearance of any thing, which, im|proved upon by bungling eager imitators, might grow into a practice pernicious to &s;ociety. Nor &s;hould it be forgotten, that every deviation from rectitude of conduct, le&s;&s;ens the dignity, and low|ers
<PB N="17" REF="038509_0016_10122C166B17A1A8">
the authority of greatmen. "Dead flies cau&s;e the ointment of theapothecary to &s;end forth a &s;tink|ing favor: &s;o doth a little folly, him that is in rep|utation for wi&s;dom and honor."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccl. x. 1.</NOTE> But,</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT weakne&s;s of government which is a ca|lamity to any people, is often principally the fault of the people them&s;elves. It may be owing to their negligence, or to their caprice and folly, in the choice of their rulers; or it may be owing to their ill-treatment of them when cho&s;en. A government mo&s;t excellent in its con&s;titution, and mo&s;t wi&s;e, ju&s;t and firm, in its admini&s;tration, may be enervated, or rendered inadequate, by the ungovernable|ne&s;s of the people: By their revilings and &s;landers&mdash;their haughtine&s;s and in&s;olence&mdash;their factions and tumults. David once &s;aid, "I am this day weak, though anointed king; and the&s;e men, the &s;ons of <HI>Zeruiah,</HI> are too hard for me."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. iii. 39.</NOTE></P>
<P>NOR mu&s;t it be omitted, that, be&s;ides the imme|diate natural cau&s;es of a weak government, the ir|religion, or general wickedne&s;s of a people, may be its procuring cau&s;e, as a judgment of heaven. "The mo&s;t High ruleth in the" nations of men; "and giveth" the dominion over them, "to whom &s;oever he will."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Dan. iv. 32.</NOTE> "For promotion cometh neither from the ea&s;t, nor from the we&s;t, nor from the &s;outh; but God is the judge; he putteth down one,

FIRST; an expo&s;edne&s;s to all manner of mutual injuries, without redre&s;s, is one obvious evil thence ari&s;ing. <HI>The people &s;hall be oppre&s;&s;ed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour.</HI></P>
<P>"SURELY oppre&s;&s;ion maketh a wi&s;e man mad," is an ob&s;ervation of the royal preacher.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccl. vii. 7.</NOTE> And many are the accounts in hi&s;tory, of oppre&s;&s;ion's having had this effect on a multitude of men, the wi&s;e a|mong the fooli&s;h. How often have whole nations raved and raged, like the fierce&s;t of animals, un|der the operation of the hydrophobia, at only a di&s;|tant appren&s;ion of this terrible evil?</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible, it is the dread of oppre&s;&s;ion <HI>from government,</HI> and not of being oppre&s;&s;ed one by a|nother, through the <HI>want</HI> or <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> of it, that u&s;ually occa&s;ions this rage, and the&s;e ravings. The people are ten times more apt to be afraid of hav|ing heavy burdens and grievous re&s;traints laid upon them, by the be&s;t men in power, than of any thing they might be in danger of &s;uffering from their equals, however wicked, and however unre&s;trained. But what can be the rea&s;on of this? Is it becau&s;e there is not really as much mi&s;chief to be feared, from individual, as from public oppre&s;&s;ion? From the oppre&s;&s;ions of the <HI>many,</HI> as of the few? From the unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of millions, let loo&s;e, as from that of one man, or a &s;mall number of men?</P>
<P>THIS, certainly, is not the ca&s;e; this cannot be
<PB N="20" REF="038509_0019_10122C1DE89C5108">
the rea&s;on. When there is no law, and every one does what he thinks fit, without fear of puni&s;hment, the people, I believe, have ever been, and are ever likely to be, much more unhappy than even under a very de&s;potic and oppre&s;&s;ive government.</P>
<P>WHAT then <HI>is</HI> the rea&s;on? Why are the people, who&s;e voice is &s;aid to be the voice of God, &s;o much more ready to &s;ound and take an alarm, when threatened with the latter, than with the former of the&s;e evils? Why are they &s;o loud and tumul|tuous, when their liberties are thought to be in any danger; and &s;o quiet and ea&s;y, when government is rudely attacked, and ready to be overthrown? Why is the &s;hock of terror &s;o much greater and more univer&s;al, at the remote&s;t pro&s;pect of tyran|ny, than at the neare&s;t, and mo&s;t evident approxi|mation to total anarchy?&mdash;There may be &s;everal rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>ONE, probably, is; when the people are op|pre&s;&s;ed by each other, their &s;ufferings are &s;eparately felt: Whereas, oppre&s;&s;ion from the higher powers falls upon all in a body. In the former ca&s;e, every one bears his own different burdens; and divided complaints, though bitter, make but a confu&s;ed and feeble murmur: in the latter ca&s;e, all feel or fear the &s;ame; all voices, therefore, are united in one tremendous cry.</P>
<P>ANOTHER rea&s;on may be; under oppre&s;&s;ion from government, often no other way of relief is &s;een,
<PB N="21" REF="038509_0020_10122C2007D52468">
than popular combinations and in&s;urrections; but when injuries are done us by individuals, becau&s;e there is no government to re&s;train them, a remedy is always near and obvious. If every one is oppre&s;|&s;ed, every one can be an oppre&s;&s;or. If a man's neighbours all bite and devour him, he can bite and devour all his neighbours. Hence, a di&s;&s;olution of government, in&s;tead of being univer&s;ally depreca|ted, appears to many, "A con&s;ummation devout|ly to be wi&s;hed."</P>
<P>BUT there is another cau&s;e of the wonderful phe|nomenon I am accounting for, more influential per|haps with the mo&s;t, than both the forementioned. It is owing to charity. A kind of charity, not the exclu&s;ive glory of modern times; but entirely pe|culiar to fallen creatures. A kind of charity, which covers a multitude of our own &s;ins, from our own &s;ight. A kind of charity which always <HI>begins,</HI> and <HI>ends, at home;</HI> though often exten&s;ive in its circuits. From this boa&s;ted charity, we are ever inclined to hope all things, and believe all things, in favour of any number, or cla&s;s, or order of beings, in which we our&s;elves are included. Thus men, naturally think of mankind, more highly than they ought to think. Frenchmen, of the French: Britons, of the Briti&s;h: Americans, of the people of Ameri|ca: Tho&s;e of every &s;tate and town, of their own &s;tate's men and town's men; and men of every cal|ling, of their brethren of the &s;ame occupation, col|lectively con&s;idered. In like manner, the common people, think the common people exceedingly hon|e&s;t,
<PB N="22" REF="038509_0021_10122C222FFC1690">
harmle&s;s, and virtuous; while of tho&s;e in power, though of their own choo&s;ing, and ju&s;t cho&s;en out of all the people, they have not near &s;o favorable an opinion. That the people &s;hould have too much liberty, therefore, they are not at all afraid: that rulers will not have checks enough upon them, is all their fear.</P>
<P>THIS beam, of &s;elfi&s;h liberality of &s;entiment, it may be impo&s;&s;ible for us to ca&s;t wholly out of our eye: But that, round the edges of it, we may get &s;ome glimp&s;e of real human nature; I know of no better way than to look upon mankind one by one; or in circles not including our&s;elves. Let us then think of other nations; other &s;tates; other towns, and neighbourhoods; or of particular per&s;ons a|mong our neare&s;t neighbours. In this &s;eparate view, let us &s;earch and look; let us impartially examine characters.&mdash;Where do we find a great predomi|nance of the innocent inoffen&s;ive people&punc; Where do we find a nation, or &s;tate, or town, or &s;ociety, except our own, &s;o very virtuous? Where do we find many individuals, be&s;ides our&s;elves, &s;o ju&s;t and true, temperate and cha&s;te, meek and merciful; &s;o free from coveteou&s;ne&s;s, pride, envy, revenge, and every unfriendly pa&s;&s;ion, that we could live &s;afe|ly among them, were they at full liberty from all the re&s;traints of law and government?</P>
<P>INDEED, how great an alteration this would make, in the apparent characters of mo&s;t men, it is difficult to conceive, without the trial. A very partial trial

of it, for a &s;hort time, &s;ome of us have once &s;een; when it was made lawful to di&s;charge pecuniary ob|ligations, at the rate of a tenth, a twentieth, and even a fiftieth, of the real value ju&s;tly due. We then had a convincing evidence, that the external ju&s;tice of our common hone&s;t people, is owing to the expected compul&s;ion of civil law, much more than to uprightne&s;s of heart, or feelings of con|&s;cience, or any dread of a higher tribunal. From this &s;pecimen, and from the &s;acred &s;tory of the behaviour of the men of Benjamin, relative to the Levite from mount Ephraim, when "there was no king in I&s;rael; and every one did that which was right in his own eyes;" we may have &s;ome faint idea of the horrid &s;cenes of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, lewdne&s;s and cruelty, that would every where be acted, were it not for the fear of temporal puni&s;hment. From all that we have read of the de&s;truction of mankind by one another, when ever they are at liberty; and from recent indi&s;putable information of the &s;hock|ing &s;tate of things, where government has been overturned; we may well believe that the &s;cripture accounts of the depravity of men, are no exagge|ration. Not even the following: "Their throat is an open &s;epulchre; with their tongues they have u&s;ed deceit; the poi&s;on of a&s;ps is under their lips; who&s;e mouth is full of cur&s;ing and bitterne&s;s; their feet are &s;wift to &s;hed blood.

But if this be a true portrait of fallen men, when left to them&s;elves, how much are we indebted to the re&s;traint laid upon them, for the little peace we enjoy? And may we not well be convinced, that all the terror of the civil &s;word, in the mo&s;t faith|ful and &s;kilful hands, will not be more than enough to re&s;train from iniquity, &s;uch a race of beings, &s;o that they may dwell together, not in unity, as breth|ren, but with any tolerable &s;afety? E&s;pecially if, as is added to fini&s;h the above picture, "There is no fear of God before their eyes?" And that this la&s;t trait, is &s;till a part of the character of many, is abundantly evident, both from their avowed prin|ciples and open practices, Now this being the ca&s;e, that while the hearts of men are fully &s;et in them to do evil, they have no fear of the God of heaven to re&s;train them; were it not for the dread of gods on earth, our civil rulers, what &s;ecurity &s;hould we have, for our names, or property, or lives? If we had no other evil to apprehend, from weakne&s;s of government, than only this, of lying open to all manner of mutual oppre&s;&s;ions, &s;lander, frauds and violences; it would, even then, be evidently one of the greate&s;t calamities that could befal a people.</P>
<P>BUT a &s;econd evil, &s;ome what di&s;tinct, and worthy of &s;ome notice, is &s;ugge&s;ted in our text: No one in a &s;ubordinate &s;tation would keep his prop|er place, or treat his &s;uperiors with &s;uitable re&s;pect. <HI>The child &s;hall behave him&s;elf proudly again&s;t the ancient, and the ba&s;e again&s;t the honorable.</HI></P>

SOLOMON &s;ays, "There is an evil which I have &s;een under the &s;un, as an error that proceedeth from the ruler: Folly is &s;et in great dignity, and the rich in low place. I have &s;een &s;ervants riding upon hor&s;es, and princes walking as &s;ervants upon the earth."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccl. x. 5, 6, 7.</NOTE> When authority fails, or is ob&s;tructed, at the fountain head, its remote&s;t &s;treams mu&s;t, in a little time, run low. If parents will not obey magi&s;trates, children will be di&s;obedient to parents; if ma&s;ters refu&s;e &s;ubjection to the higher powers, their &s;ervants and apprentices will &s;oon pay as little regard to their injunctions. Thus this evil proceed|eth from the ruler; or from his not being able to rule. And a &s;erious evil it certainly is. By &s;uperi|ors, in every degree, it will &s;oon be very &s;en&s;ibly felt. They will have none to fear them, none to honor them, none over whom they can have any command. Inferiors, of the very lowe&s;t grade, may exult, for a while, in &s;uch aeras of freedom; and think them glorious times. But even to the&s;e&mdash;to the child and the ba&s;e, this turning of things up&s;ide down, generally proves fatal in the end.

<P><PB N="26" REF="038509_0025_10122C2BBA83C068">
THERE is yet a third capital evil, ari&s;ing from too weak a government, which, though not mentioned in our text, &s;hould be briefly noticed, when treat|ing of this &s;ubject at large. A community in &s;uch a &s;ituation, will be able to make little defence again&s;t a foreign enemy. Like the people of Lai&s;h, who had no magi&s;trate in the land to put them to &s;hame in any thing; they will be an ea&s;y prey to any hand|ful of enterpri&s;ing invaders. No re&s;ources can be drawn forth&mdash;no navies furni&s;hed&mdash;no armies rai&s;|ed and &s;upplied&mdash;no fortifications erected and gar|ri&s;oned, without energy in government. What Sol|omon &s;ays of a man that has no rule over his own &s;pirit, holds equally true of an ungoverned nation: it "is as a city that is broken down, and without walls."</P>
<P>THE doctrine, I conceive, needs no farther il|lu&s;tration or proof. It only remains, that I en|deavor to point out &s;ome u&s;eful inferences from it, applicable to our own times, and to the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE holy &s;criptures may hence be vindicated, in their being &s;o much on the &s;ide of government; and no more favorable to the in&s;urrection of infe|riors.</P>
<P>ON the&s;e topics, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, as well as of the old te&s;tament, is &s;omewhat different from the &s;pirit that worketh in the children of di&s;obedience, among whom we have

all had our conver&s;ation. Our Saviour "went a|bout doing good, and healing all that were oppre&s;&s;ed of the devil;" but under the politcal oppre&s;&s;ions of the Jews, his countrymen, he &s;eemed not much to &s;ympathize with them. When it hurt their con|&s;ciences to pay tribute to a foreign power, and they a&s;ked him whether it were lawful; his an&s;wer was, "Render to Cae&s;ar, the things that are Cae&s;ar's, and to God, the things that are God's." He con|&s;tantly preached peace, meekne&s;s, humility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. His apo&s;tles in like manner, taught children to obey and honor their parents: and &s;er|vants to be "&s;ubject to their own ma&s;ters, with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but al&s;o to the froward." And, in&s;tead of animating their numerous pro&s;elytes, at Crete, at Rome, and all over the world, to ri&s;e in arms again&s;t the&s;e rulers of the earth who were their unrighteous and unmer|ciful per&s;ecutors; they would have them "put in mind to be &s;ubject to principalities and powers, to obey magi&s;trates:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. iii. 1.</NOTE> they exhorted them to "&s;ub|mit them&s;elves to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's &s;ake;"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">a Pet. ii. 13.</NOTE> and told them, "Who&s;oever re|&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God; and they that re&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves dam|nation."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>AT this di&s;tance of time, and after &s;o many rev|olutions, &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as the&s;e may &s;eem hard &s;ay|ings, to &s;ome <HI>good &s;oldiers,</HI> even of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. No wonder that the inculcators of &s;o much pover|ty
<PB N="28" REF="038509_0027_10122C2D4C0A3EB0">
of &s;pirit, &s;hould be rejected with &s;corn, and treated with &s;currility, in this "age of rea&s;on." We are not to wonder, were there no other cau&s;e, that infidelity &s;hould exceedingly increa&s;e, in the&s;e times of "illumination."</P>
<P>To the <HI>&s;piritually</HI> minded Chri&s;tian, however, it will readily occur, in favour of the author and fin|i&s;her of our faith, and his fir&s;t mini&s;ters, that the great object they had in view, was to &s;ave the <HI>&s;ouls</HI> of men; and that, teaching them to be meek and lowly in heart, poor in &s;pirit, and contented in what&s;oever &s;tate they were, was better adapted to this de&s;ign; than filling the heads of inferiors with exalted notions of the equal "rights of man;" in|flaming their hearts with pride and angry pa&s;&s;ions; and throwing families into envying and &s;trife, and nations into the convul&s;ions of civil war; till every one can be as free as the free&s;t, and as high as the highe&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT, leaving <HI>things eternal</HI> out of the que&s;tion; according to the &s;ubject to which we have now been attending, if the preachers and penmen of the New-Te&s;tament had aimed only to promote the <HI>temporal</HI> happine&s;s, of only the <HI>lower cla&s;&s;es</HI> of mankind, they would have done wi&s;ely in writing and preach|ing, on the duties of &s;ubordination, exactly as they did. Never can there be peace on earth, or any &s;afety among men, while children are allowed to ri&s;e up again&s;t their parents, &s;ervants again&s;t their ma&s;ters, and &s;ubjects again&s;t their civil rulers, when|ever
<PB N="29" REF="038509_0028_10122C2EE90AED70">
they think differently from them, or di&s;like their government. Thus to make the child, the governor of his governors, and the ba&s;e, the judge of his judges, is the certain way to endle&s;s confu|&s;ion, in all human &s;ocieties.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF the doctrine in&s;i&s;ted on be true, it follows, that a ready &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all tho&s;e burdens which are nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of good govern|ment, and for national defence, is the wi&s;dom, as well as duty of any people.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle to the Romans, having &s;aid, "The powers that be are ordained of God;" having ob|&s;erved that the benevolent end of their ordination was the good of the people; and, on the&s;e grounds, having enjoined &s;ubjection to them, he adds; "For this cau&s;e pay ye <HI>tribute</HI> al&s;o: for they are God's mini&s;ters, attending continually upon this very thing."</P>
<P>PUBLIC expen&s;es are apt to appear to many, ex|ce&s;&s;ively high: but, perhaps, they do not well con|&s;ider the real occa&s;ion there is for great expendi|tures, in a nation or &s;tate of any magnitude.</P>
<P>IN order to the &s;upport of good government, many rulers, of high and low degree, are ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary. And it is nece&s;&s;ary that tho&s;e who occupy the higher offices, &s;hould be men of &s;upe|rior knowledge, and uncommon natural abilities: &s;uch knowledge as is not ea&s;ily acquired, and &s;uch
<PB N="30" REF="038509_0029_10122C3192D4D0E8">
abilities as might procure them a plentiful income in other occupations. If the <HI>bramble,</HI> or the <HI>&s;hrub oak,</HI> were adequate to rule over the trees, a cheap government might be expected; but if the <HI>vine,</HI> the <HI>fig-tree,</HI> and the <HI>olive-tree,</HI> mu&s;t be promoted; we are not to think that the&s;e will leave their <HI>rich fruits;</HI> their <HI>&s;weetne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>fatne&s;s,</HI> without a &s;uita|ble compen&s;ation.&mdash;Be&s;ides, rulers of high rank, mu&s;t be at no incon&s;iderable expen&s;e, to &s;upport the proper dignity of their &s;tations. It is al&s;o to be taken into the account, that the duties of tho&s;e who rule well, and attend continually upon this very thing, are not only exceedingly laborious, but that &s;ome parts of the e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices they have to render mu&s;t be very di&s;agreeable; if they have any compa&s;&s;ionate &s;en&s;ibility. The execution of de&s;erved vengeance, is &s;aid to be <HI>God's &s;trange</HI> work; as being, in it&s;elf, mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to One who&s;e nature is <HI>love,</HI> and who <HI>delighteth</HI> in mercy. And, doubtle&s;s, that puni&s;hment of evil doers, for which earthly rulers are appointed, and which the public good requires, mu&s;t be really painful to the feelings of humanity; more painful, in many ca&s;es, than the amputation of limbs, and other high operations in &s;urgery, for which, on that ac|count, as well as becau&s;e of the &s;uperior &s;kill and great care requi&s;ite, an ample fee to the operator is thought rea&s;onable. Moreover; tho&s;e who &s;tand in elevated &s;tations, are the marks of obloquy, and expo&s;ed to many danger, much more than men on the level ground of private life. All the&s;e things well weighed, the equitable reward of governors,
<PB N="31" REF="038509_0030_10122C3443F4F080">
and the nece&s;&s;ary co&s;t of &s;upporting good govern|ment, mu&s;t be no incon&s;iderable burden on the people.</P>
<P>IN order to national defence, again&s;t ho&s;tilities from abroad, &s;till heavier expen&s;es are often indi&s;|pen&s;ible. In perilous times, there mu&s;t be armies and fleets, forts and garri&s;ons. At the fir&s;t out &s;et, more e&s;pecially, when all the&s;e things are to be new-created, to a people unu&s;ed to &s;uch va&s;t ex|penditures, they will naturally appear enormous; and very ea&s;ily may a popular clamor be rai&s;ed a|gain&s;t them. It is po&s;&s;ible, indeed, that more may be laid out in the&s;e ways, many times, than the public exigences require; but of this, few of the complainers are competent to judge. A nation that has an extended coa&s;t, and an exten&s;ive com|merce to defend, had better be at immen&s;e charges for the &s;ecurity of the&s;e, than lie open to tho&s;e &s;poliations and inva&s;ions, to which, without arm|ing, when all the world is at war, they might in|evitably be expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>To provide both for the internal and external &s;afety of a numerous people, the burdens laid upon them mu&s;t often be heavy. The&s;e are evils to be lamented; but in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of mankind, they are nece&s;&s;ary for the prevention of far greater evils; and &s;hould therefore be &s;ubmitted to, with|out murmuring.</P>

us, &s;ome peculiar advantages of a republican form of government.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This inference was pa&s;&s;ed over in the delivery.</NOTE></P>
<P>UNDER every form, there mu&s;t be orders and degrees; &s;ome mu&s;t bear rule, and others be &s;ubject to tribute.

Much advantage hath the republican, many ways.</P>
<P>ONE advantage is, that the people may always have good rulers, unle&s;s it be their own fault. Un|der a monarchy, or an ari&s;tocracy, let the body of the people be ever &s;o virtuous, and ever &s;o vigilant, they may have children for their princes, and babes to rule over them. When power is hereditary, in kings or nobles, not only is there a ri&s;k of having the highe&s;t &s;eats of government filled by minors; but, if this &s;hould not happen, the hazard is great, that tho&s;e who inherit the fir&s;t offices of govern|ment, will frequently be men of not much knowl|edge, or of not much virtue. But in elective gov|ernments, where the people at large are the elec|tors, and e&s;pecially where the elections are frequent, they may always have wi&s;e and faithful men in all places of authority; if &s;uch are to be found, and if &s;uch they choo&s;e.</P>
<P>IT may next be ob&s;erved; that in republican governments, there is the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for illegal
<PB N="33" REF="038509_0032_10122C37619630B8">
a&s;&s;ociations, or popular tumults, to obtain a re|dre&s;s of grievances. If there be any mal-admini&s;|tration, or any fault in the con&s;titution, a remedy is provided, without di&s;turbing the public peace.</P>
<P>ANOTHER advantage mu&s;t not be forgotten, which is very great: under this free form of gov|ernment, the intere&s;ts of rulers and &s;ubjects are &s;o blended&mdash;&s;o the &s;ame, that the former cannot op|pre&s;s the latter, without equally oppre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves. In an ab&s;olute monarchy, the king; and in an ari&s;tocracy, the nobles, may "bind heavy burdens, and lay them on men's &s;houlders," with|out being obliged to "touch them them&s;elves with one of their fingers:" but in democracies, the highe&s;t magi&s;trates are &s;ubject to the &s;ame laws, the &s;ame duties, the &s;ame taxes, which they impo&s;e upon others. At lea&s;t. tho&s;e who this year bear rule, the next election may be under law, under tribute. This is a great &s;ecurity again&s;t their de|creeing unrighteous decrees, and writing grievous things.</P>
<P>LASTLY; repre&s;entative rulers feel them&s;elves &s;o dependent on the people, for their continuance in office, that they are not likely to grow haughty and unrea&s;onably over-bearing, as tho&s;e naturally will, who have no &s;uch dependence.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the peculiar advantages of a republican government. But then, it is to be well
<PB N="34" REF="038509_0033_10122C3AE6E40630">
remembered, that the be&s;t things may become the wor&s;t for us, by being abu&s;ed. To render demo|cratic governments &s;table and happy, it is highly nece&s;&s;ary that the people &s;hould be wi&s;e; virtuous, peaceable, and ea&s;ily governed. For want of the&s;e requi&s;ites, republics have often been, like "man that is born of a woman, of few days, and full of trouble."</P>
<P N="4">4. IN the more particular application of our &s;ubject, we are naturally led to a view and convic|tion, of our own mercies, and privileges, and pro&s;|pects, and duties.</P>
<P>THAT the pa&s;t mercies of Heaven towards this country, have been &s;ingularly great, every pious ob&s;erver will be ready devoutly to acknowledge. I have reference, chiefly, to political mercies; or tho&s;e which relate to civil liberty and government. Hardly another in&s;tance can be found, I believe, in all hi&s;tory, of a people's enjoying both the&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings jointly, in &s;o high a degree, for &s;o great a length of time, as they have been enjoyed by &s;eve|ral of the&s;e united &s;tates; and by this &s;tate, in particular. The people of Connecticut, from the beginning, have invariably cho&s;en their chief ma|gi&s;trates, and general a&s;&s;embly; and they have had a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of good governors far beyond the com|mon lot of mankind. Our "officers have been peace, and our exactors righteou&s;ne&s;s," with as few exceptions, perhaps, as ever were known in any part of the world.</P>

OR, if we confine the retro&s;pect, within the compa&s;s of the la&s;t five and twenty years; and ex|tend it to the whole union, how wonderful have been the &s;alvations granted us! In this period, we have pa&s;&s;ed through the Red Sea of a revolutiona|ry war; in which our then friends and coadjutors, a&s;&s;aying to follow us, as mo&s;t who ever attempted it before us, have been drowned. Here, quite con|trary to what u&s;ually happens, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, we had guides eminent for prudence, &s;tability, coolne&s;s, and unconquerable per&s;everance. And <HI>one,</HI> &s;uper-eminent for all tho&s;e; by the integrity of who&s;e heart, and the &s;kilfulne&s;s of who&s;e hands, we were led like a flock, in &s;afety, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all rational expectation. We have al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed, after|wards, thro the howling wilderne&s;s of an almo&s;t na|tional anarchy: where were pits, and &s;corpions, and fiery flying &s;erpents. Here again, our great men, with <HI>the greate&s;t of all</HI> at their head, in a general con|vention, formed and recommended our pre&s;ent ad|mirable con&s;titution. And our wi&s;e&s;t coun&s;ellors and mo&s;t eloquent orators, in every &s;tate, &s;training every nerve, procured its adoption; whereby we were &s;aved, when on the brink of di&s;&s;olution. That &s;uch men were rai&s;ed up, and put forward, in the&s;e times of need; and their way made pro&s;perous; was certainly "the Lord's doing, and ought to be marvellous in our eyes," In either of the&s;e perils, "it was of the Lord's mercies that we were not con&s;umed."</P>

AND as pa&s;t mercies, &s;o our pre&s;ent privileges, are &s;ingular, and &s;uch as de&s;erve a very grateful acknowledgment. While many other nations are &s;uffering the ravages of a mo&s;t furious war, &s;till likely to be carried on with redoubled rage; we enjoy the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings of peace. While mo&s;t other nations are under the dominion of he|reditary kings and nobles, &s;uch as they happen to be born and educated, whether virtuous or vicious, wi&s;e men or fools; we have rulers from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, of our own election. While one oth|er nation, great and highly civilized, after &s;wimming in &s;eas of blood for eight years, and after nearly as many revolutions, in a violent conte&s;t for liberty and equality, has at la&s;t, nothing more of either than the empty name, we po&s;&s;e&s;s the reality of both, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with any order or &s;afety.</P>
<P>OUR national expen&s;es are nece&s;&s;arily great: but the burden of them is laid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, on tho&s;e mo&s;t able to bear it; among whom, the im|po&s;ers, being of the richer cla&s;s, have taken a large proportion on them&s;elves. In the nation, and in this &s;tate, the policy of government, certainly, is not to "grind the face of the poor." The mild|ne&s;s and gentlene&s;s of our admini&s;tration, it appears to me, is generally very great; and, in regard to its wi&s;dom and firmne&s;s, con&s;idering the times, I think it de&s;erving of much applau&s;e. Re&s;pecting rulers, certainly our condition, hitherto, is far dif|ferent from that de&s;cribed and threatened in our text.</P>

SUCH <HI>have been</HI> our mercies; &s;uch <HI>are</HI> our priv|ileges. What then are our pro&s;pects?&mdash;Not alto|gether fair and promi&s;ing, after all.

Our mountain is not yet &s;o &s;trong, that we have rea&s;on, from any quarter, to &s;ay in our pro&s;perity, we &s;hall never be moved.</P>
<P>SOME may flatter them&s;elves, that, although other republics have frequently been tumultuous, and of &s;hort continuance; ours will be peaceful and permanent, becau&s;e of the greater knowledge and virtue of the people.</P>
<P>IT is true, in this part of the union at lea&s;t, "We know that we all have knowledge." But, I doubt, we have more of the "knowledge which puffeth up," than of that knowledge which promi&s;es "&s;tability of times." It is true, we have the light of the go&s;|pel; and were we di&s;po&s;ed to be guided by this light, we need not fear the fate of ancient republics, that were bewildered in Pagan darkne&s;s. But, in matters relative to government and &s;ubordination; too many choo&s;e to take their in&s;tructions from Heathen philo&s;ophy, rather than from the oracles of God. And as the knowledge, &s;o the virtue, of even this happy country, exceedingly wants to be Chri&s;tianized. It is true, our "charity abound|eth:"
<PB N="38" REF="038509_0037_10122C431168CD68">
but I am afraid we have not much of that charity which is "the bond of perfectne&s;s, or the bond of peace."</P>
<P>PERHAPS &s;ome good people are ready to think, we may &s;afely "tru&s;t in God; who hath delivered, and doth deliver, that he will yet deliver us."

<P>WHAT farther public calamities the &s;udden de|cea&s;e of this great Saviour of his country may por|tend, God only knows.

But <HI>his</HI> breath is in his no&s;trils; and &s;o is the breath of every other man, mo&s;t accounted of; in the nation, or in the &s;tate, Nor is natural death, the only way whereby our remaining firm pillars, may be removed.</P>

AND if we con&s;ider the &s;pirit that now worketh, well may we be apprehen&s;ive of unhappy changes; and of all the evils threatened in our text. Some of the&s;e, we already experience. Though God hath not given children to be our princes, nor many bad men, we hope, to rule over us; yet the people are oppre&s;&s;ed one by another, in a degree, I believe, beyond what has been u&s;ual heretofore. And certainly it is a remarkable day, for the child's behaving him&s;elf proudly again&s;t the ancient, and the ba&s;e again&s;t the honorable. Nor is this to be wondered at. Of &s;uch &s;cenes as we have lately pa&s;&s;ed through, it is the natural con&s;equence. In revolutionary times, all expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect are wont to be laid a&s;ide, or the application of them re|ver&s;ed. The great le&s;&s;ons inculcated on youth, in|&s;tead of mode&s;ty, dutifulne&s;s and &s;ubordination; are boldne&s;s, &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, and &s;elf-importance. Children, too young to read the bible, or to be taught their catechi&s;m, are mounted on the &s;tage, to act the orator, the patriot and politician: while the parents, the aged and the wi&s;e, &s;it or &s;tand a|round in low place, wonder and applaud. <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius,</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot <HI>Je&s;us</HI> nor <HI>Paul, Peter</HI> nor <HI>John,</HI>) are the great models and in&s;tructors, of the ri&s;ing generation of Chri&s;tians. Such things as the&s;e, <HI>we</HI> have &s;een; and the effects of them, we &s;till &s;adly feel. Habits of &s;ubordination, always painful to human pride; when once effaced, or much weak|ened, are not ea&s;ily re&s;tored. On the other hand, habits of haughtine&s;s and di&s;obedience, always
<PB N="42" REF="038509_0041_10122C4BB05ECC18">
congenial to the human heart; when once imbibed, naturally increa&s;e to more ungovernablene&s;s. One point of freedom gained, another is &s;truggled for with the greater ardor. Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, like the grave, never &s;ays, "It is enough."</P>
<P>IN this &s;tate, though not near &s;o free as &s;ome, great liberties are enjoyed. We have liberty to do every thing that we ought; and a great many things that we ought not. In matters of religion, our liberties are almo&s;t unbounded. We may &s;ell, buy and read, what <HI>books</HI> we plea&s;e: the be&s;t, or the mo&s;t athei&s;tical and bla&s;phemous. We may wor|&s;hip what <HI>god</HI> we choo&s;e: a ju&s;t God, or one who has no ju&s;tice for men to fear. Every <HI>creature,</HI> has equal liberty to preach the go&s;pel: and to preach what go&s;pel he thinks proper. Tho&s;e who per&s;uade men by the terrors of the Lord, to &s;tand in awe, and not &s;in; and tho&s;e who embolden men in all manner of iniquity, by a&s;&s;urances of no wrath to come, have equal encouragement. Any people may make the firme&s;t legal contract for the &s;up|port of what mini&s;ter they will; and any number, or all of them, may break it when they will.&mdash;In civil matters, our liberty is a little more circum|&s;cribed; yet, in the&s;e, we have a good deal of el|bow-room, to do wrong, as well as right. We may honor all men, or defame the mo&s;t dignified and worthy characters. We may &s;peak the truth, or a&s;&s;ert and propagate fal&s;ehoods. Men may fulfil their promi&s;es, or not fulfil them; pay their debts, or never pay them, without any re&s;traint, or much
<PB N="43" REF="038509_0042_10122C4E5392E510">
danger of compul&s;ion. All the&s;e liberties, and a thou&s;and others, if not explicitly by law allowed; are taken, very freely by many, in their wor&s;t lat|itude; and taken with impunity, in a multitude of in&s;tances.</P>
<P>YET, with all this, numbers among our&s;elves, and much greater numbers in the freer &s;tates, it is &s;aid, are not &s;atisfied; but are &s;triving, by calum|nies, and by intrigues, for new revolutions &s;till further to weaken government. That &s;ome men might wi&s;h to have their own hands and tongues at greater liberty, provided their neighbours and ene|mies could be kept fa&s;t bound, may ea&s;ily be con|ceived: but how any man, on the lea&s;t &s;ober re|flection, &s;hould be willing that all others &s;hould be under le&s;s re&s;traint than they now are, appears al|mo&s;t inconceivable. One would have thought, that the tragedy &s;o long exhibited on the great European theatre of confu&s;ion, and e&s;pecially the la&s;t &s;cene; mu&s;t have opened the eyes of the mo&s;t blind; and obliged them to &s;ee, that overturning and overturn|ing, with a view to break all bonds of &s;ociety a&s;un|der, is not the way to public happine&s;s, or per&s;onal &s;afety. Neverthele&s;s, this &s;eems not to have been the ca&s;e. A majority of the people, however, it may be pre&s;umed, are convinced, that our greate&s;t immediate danger, is of having too little govern|ment, not too little liberty.</P>
<P>NOR are our <HI>duties,</HI> if we have this conviction, hard to be under&s;tood. Were we in earne&s;t di&s;po|&s;ed,

to &s;tand in the ways, and &s;ee, and a&s;k for the old paths, where is the good way? And would we walk therein, re&s;t might be found; and the threat|ened evils now &s;poken of, be prevented.</P>
<P>IF we would not have the child behave him&s;elf proudly again&s;t the ancient, and the ba&s;e again&s;t the honorable, greater attention &s;hould be paid to the &s;chooling and government of the ri&s;ing generation. Some attempt towards a reform in this matter has already been made, under the au&s;pices of the gene|ral a&s;&s;embly: and, as far as I have had opportuni|ty to ob&s;erve, it has been attended with encoura|ging effects. It is nece&s;&s;ary that tho&s;e ju&s;t weaned from the brea&s;t, &s;hould have line upon line, and pre|cept upon precept; and it is of importance what tho&s;e lines and precepts are. Little ones &s;hould be learnt their letters, at lea&s;t; if not a few lines of the New-Te&s;tament, before they are learnt to be Grecian and Roman orators and patriots. They &s;hould be learnt a little mode&s;ty, and a little man|ners, before they are learnt to govern the nation. They &s;hould be made <HI>good children,</HI> before we at|tempt to make them <HI>great men.</HI></P>
<P>IF our legi&s;lators would prevent our being op|pre&s;&s;ed every one by another, the old and good way is, to have a code of laws, as &s;hort and plain as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;uitably inforced. Ob&s;olete laws; and laws the only tendency of which is to evade, or needle&s;sly delay, the operation of ju&s;tice; I &s;hould think, ought to be repealed. And certainly great

care &s;hould be taken, by the appointment of capa|ble and faithful judiciary and informing officers, that the laws unrepealed be duly executed.</P>

<P>IF the freemen&mdash;the fountain of power, would &s;trengthen government, or guard again&s;t its being farther weakened; they &s;hould be very punctual in attending their legal meetings, and very careful for whom they give in their &s;uffrages, as members of A&s;&s;embly, or of Congre&s;s. They &s;hould &s;ee that they do not vote for weak men, however hone&s;t; nor for vicious men, however capable; nor for in|triguing men, who are crowding them&s;elves forward by every popular artifice: who under&s;tand perfect|ly all the duties and faults of their &s;uperiors, but
<PB N="46" REF="038509_0045_10122C542FC94AA8">
&s;ee no beam in their own eye, and never mind their own bu&s;ine&s;s. Men of real abilities, are generally una&s;&s;uming and &s;elf-diffident. Men &s;en&s;ible of the difficulties and re&s;pon&s;ibility of important po&s;ts of tru&s;t, are generally backward to undertake them. Men re&s;tle&s;s where they are, and trouble&s;ome to tho&s;e above them, are generally haughty and over|bearing, if advanced to higher &s;tations. Nor &s;hould the freemen be too much given to change; unle&s;s they mean to weaken government. Bad men, if in office, cannot be too &s;oon turned out; but tho&s;e who have ruled well, ought not to be dropped, mere|ly that every man may have his turn; nor merely to &s;how the great power of the people, and to keep their <HI>&s;ervants,</HI> who <HI>govern</HI> them, more in fear of them.</P>
<P>THE mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, are thought to have no concern with the temporal happine&s;s of man|kind: doubtle&s;s, the good way for them, whether the old way or not, is to confine them&s;elves very much to their &s;piritual vocation. Doubtle&s;s their principal bu&s;ine&s;s is, to &s;ave the &s;ouls of tho&s;e who hear them. But in order to this, they mu&s;t warn all, of that "wrath of God which is revealed from heaven, again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men," They mu&s;t "convert &s;inners from the error of their ways," or they cannot "&s;ave their &s;ouls from death." They mu&s;t teach their converts to "ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever Chri&s;t hath commanded," by him&s;elf or his Apo&s;tles; or they cannot make them "meet to be partakers of the

inheritance of the &s;aints in light." And among the&s;e in&s;tructions, teaching them to "obey tho&s;e who have the rule over them, and to be cautious how they &s;peak evil of dignities, mu&s;t not be omit|ted. Mini&s;ters mu&s;t not "&s;hun to declare all the coun&s;el of God," both to rulers and &s;ubjects, if they would be "pure from the blood of all men." In a word, they wu&s;t do what in them lies to make all their hearers <HI>good Chri&s;tians;</HI> for without this they can never get them to heaven; and they need do no more, to make them peaceable and orderly members of &s;ociety on earth. Thus far, and in this manner, <HI>Aaron</HI> may &s;till &s;upport the hand of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> in mini&s;tering to the <HI>temporal</HI> good of men, even in a con&s;i&s;tency with the modern line of &s;eparation drawn between them.</P>
<P>LASTLY; all, of every order, if they would do their part to prevent all the evils threatened in our text and context, from coming upon us, as the righteous judgments of Heaven, mu&s;t &s;ee that their tongues and their doings are not again&s;t the Lord. Never can we rationally hope that God will be at peace with us, unle&s;s we treat his laws and or|dinances with greater attention and re&s;pect. Un|le&s;s we cea&s;e to do evil, and learn to do well; un|le&s;s &s;ome check be put to tho&s;e loo&s;e principles, and licentious practices, which have over-flowed all our cities, and towns, and villages.</P>
<P>THE old paths, then, and the good way, to
<PB N="48" REF="038509_0047_10122C585C810328">
which we mu&s;t return, and in which we mu&s;t walk, would we find re&s;t, are plain before us.</P>
<P>BUT, it is to be feared, the voice of a ma|jority may now be, as it was in the days of Jeremi|ah: <HI>We will not walk therein.</HI> Both from the &s;igns of the times, and from &s;everal predictions of &s;crip|ture, I think the probability is, that things are not about to alter for the better, but for the wor&s;e. Mankind &s;eem yet combining, and "taking coun|&s;el together, again&s;t the Lord, and again&s;t his a|nointed, &s;aying, Let us break their bands a&s;under, and ca&s;t away their cords from us;" and God &s;eems remarkably leaving them to &s;trong delu&s;ions, to believe &s;trange lies. He &s;eems determined to let them go on, and try the boa&s;ted experiment of lib|erty and revolutions, to the uttermo&s;t: de&s;igning, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, to have a more convictive di&s;|covery exhibited, than has ever yet been given, of the madne&s;s in the heart of the &s;ons of men, be|fore the general regeneration of the world. The unclean &s;pirits, predicted to come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the bea&s;t, and out of the mouth of the fal&s;e prophet, as rep|re&s;ented in the vi&s;ion of John; appear evidently to have gone forth over all the earth, and to have been exceedingly bu&s;y and &s;ucce&s;sful, in rai&s;ing and training up their forces for the battle of that great day of God Almighty;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvi. 13, 14.</NOTE> which, according to the common calculation of expo&s;itors, is now only
<PB N="49" REF="038509_0048_1012420CF79CB990">
commencing. Whether we turn our eyes to the word of prophecy, or to the a&s;pects of providence, we have rea&s;on to be very apprehen&s;ive, that "this darkne&s;s" is yet for a while, to "cover the earth, and gro&s;s darkne&s;s the people,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. ix. 2.</NOTE> in a greater and greater degree, before the expected reign of light and truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, let not good men de&s;pond: nor let them relax their exertions to repel, as long and as exten&s;ively as they can, the prevalence of error, irreligion and wretchedne&s;s. Mightier is He that is with them, than all that are again&s;t them. When it is a&s;ked in the eleventh P&s;alm: "If the founda|tions be de&s;troyed, what can the righteous do?" the an&s;wer is &s;hort, but very emphatical and abun|dantly &s;ufficient: <HI>"The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD's throne is in heaven.</HI> El&s;ewhere, the P&s;almi&s;t, adoring the power and wi&s;dom of the Mo&s;t High, &s;ays, "Surely the wrath of man &s;hall prai&s;e thee; the remainder of the wrath &s;halt thou re&s;train."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxxvi. 10.</NOTE> It is often &s;aid, "Chri&s;t is able to &s;up|port his own church and mini&s;ters, without the aid of human laws." This is doubtle&s;s true, it is al&s;o true, that Chri&s;t is able to take care of his church, and to bring the many &s;ons given him to glory, without any mini&s;ters at all. And equally true is it, that God is able to govern the nations, without the help of earthly rulers. But, from the&s;e prem|i&s;es,
<PB N="50" REF="038509_0049_1012420E9E048E18">
the con&s;equence will not follow, without hard drawing, that men may innocently and &s;afely ne|glect exerting the power they have, for the &s;upport, either of good goverment, or of uncorrupted Chri&s;tianity. "Tho&s;e that walk in pride, God is able to aba&s;e;" but is there therefore nothing haz|ardous, nor wrong, in thus walking? A cur&s;e was once denounced, on them who "came not to the help of the Lord, again&s;t the mighty; though the Lord helped him&s;elf, without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But the foregoing truths, however they may have been perverted to the countenancing of human negli|gence in the cau&s;e of God or Chri&s;t, are matter of ju&s;t con&s;olation to the pious and good, when they walk in darkne&s;s and have no light: when they &s;ee little probability that their utmo&s;t efforts for the &s;up|port of order, or of undefiled religion, will have any effect.</P>
<P>THERE will always be &s;ome, and &s;ome that ought to be leaders and teachers, who&s;e policy it is, to turn with the times; to &s;wim with the tide, and &s;wing with the vibrating pendulum of popular opin|ion. Who will trim their way to &s;eek love; and "become all things to all men, if by all means they may &s;ave" <HI>them&s;elves.</HI> But a &s;teadfa&s;t adher|ence to truth and duty, however great the apparent danger, is the only way of real &s;afety. He who thus "lo&s;es his life, &s;hall &s;ave it;" and he &s;hall lo&s;e his life who would &s;ave it," by de&s;erting his po&s;t, or hiding him&s;elf under refuges of fal&s;ehood, when evil is fore&s;een. "The fearful and unbeliev|ing,

&s;hall have their part" at la&s;t, in the &s;ame lake with bolder tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. "The fear of man bringeth a &s;nare; but who&s;o putteth his tru&s;t in the Lord &s;hall be &s;afe"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxix. 25.</NOTE> For the encouragement of good men, in perilous times, and particularly of good rulers, it is written: "He that walketh righteou&s;ly, and &s;peaketh uprightly; he that de|&s;pi&s;eth the gain of oppre&s;&s;ions, that &s;haketh his hands from holding of bribes, that &s;toppeth his ears from, hearing of blood, and &s;hutteth his eyes from &s;eeing evil; he &s;hall dwell on high; his place of defence &s;hall be the munitions of rocks: bread &s;hall be giv|en him, his waters &s;hall be &s;ure,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xxxiii. 15, 16.</NOTE> On the&s;e grounds is the exhortation in I&s;aiah, a few chapters after our text,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. viii. 12, 13.</NOTE> with which I &s;hall conclude.
