<BIBL>II. SAMUEL, 1. 27.</BIBL>
<Q>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed!</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE &s;udden and alarming death of our venerable Father and il|lu&s;trious Citizen, who is lately fallen, is an event &s;o affecting and important, that I ri&s;e to addre&s;s you, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, with the mingled emotions of diffidence and &s;orrow. When we con&s;ider the magnitude of the &s;ubject which is to occupy our pre&s;ent attention, and the univer&s;al gloom it has &s;pread over every mind throughout this exten&s;ive country, it &s;eems utterly beyond the power of human de&s;cription to paint it in a proper manner. In order, however, to accompli&s;h this, as far as po&s;&s;ible in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and lead our minds to a &s;uitable contemplation and improvement of this me|lancholy di&s;pen&s;ation of Divine Providence, I have cho&s;en the pa&s;|&s;age of &s;acred &s;cripture which is now before us.</P>
<P>IT is a part of an elegant elegy, compo&s;ed by the Poet of I&s;ra|el; and &s;ung by him, to expre&s;s the deep &s;orrow of his heart, on a mournful and &s;olemn occa&s;ion. The occa&s;ion was this. When the royal leader of God's cho&s;en people had received information that his country was invaded by a numerous army of the Phili&s;tines, he led forth the armies of I&s;rael again&s;t them. Zealous of his country's rights, and attached to the highe&s;t intere&s;t of his people,
<PB N="4" REF="037199_0004_100D3A516C9CAF50">
like an intrepid hero, he per&s;onally entered the field of battle, with his brave and affectionate &s;ons around him. But, not with &s;tanding all his military prowe&s;s and mighty achievements, his army gave way to their formidable enemies; who&s;e archers &s;ingled out the roy|al family, and pre&s;&s;ed hard after the valiant Saul and beloved Jona|than, and overtook and flew them on mount Gilboa.</P>
<P>WHEN tidings of this melancholy and mournful event reached the ears of the pious David, the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e, his benevolent heart was overwhelmed with &s;orrow, and he bur&s;t forth in the pathetic language of our text. <Q><HI>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed!</HI></Q></P>
<P>WAVING all remarks on the analogy, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t, between the King of I&s;rael and our beloved WASHING|TON&mdash;we &s;hall immediately proceed to con&s;ider the pa&s;&s;age before us, with particular reference to the latter, who has &s;o recently fall|en under the power of death; and hold up to your view, the im|provement which we &s;hould make of it.</P>
<P>IN this view of our &s;ubject, I am per&s;uaded that every heart in this a&s;&s;embly will re&s;ound our text, and exclaim, <Q><HI>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed!</HI></Q></P>
<P>I SHALL con&s;ider the word <HI>mighty,</HI> in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this &s;ubject, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, as implying <HI>greatne&s;s</HI> and <HI>excellence,</HI> as well as <HI>power.</HI></P>
<P>OUR venerable father, who&s;e death we this day commemorate, was <HI>mighty,</HI> in the fir&s;t place, in his PERSONAL TALENTS and VIRTUES.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="037199_0005_100D3A53009EEB98">
NOT only, my Brethren, was he peculiarly maje&s;tic in his ex|ternal form, and uniformly dignified in the whole of his deportment, but he was endowed with a mind of &s;uperior talents and illu&s;trious virtues, which fitted him for great and mighty achievements. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a clear and comprehen&s;ive under&s;tanding, which &s;eemed at once to enter into the mo&s;t intricate &s;ubjects, and almo&s;t in&s;tantly view them in all their connections and parts. He appeared equally formed for the field or the cabinet; and could as readily mar&s;hal the contending army, as balance the power of civil government. His will was energetic and deci&s;ive, and &s;eemed always &s;ub&s;ervient to his rea&s;on and judgment, and the will and &s;overeignty of the peo|ple. His affections were pure and ardent, and glowed with one &s;teady and increa&s;ing flame of love to his friends and his country. All the powers of his mind were enlarged, noble, and dignified; far &s;uperior to every thing mean, low and deba&s;ing; and were gene|rally employed, from early life, in the great affairs of our nation.</P>
<P>As to his virtues, they were as &s;plendid as his talents, and &s;hone con&s;picuous in all his conduct. He was clothed with a dignified humility as with a garment; and his great mind appeared never ela|ted with all the triumphs of victory, the plaudits of his country and &s;plendour of courts. He was temperate, amid&s;t all the luxury and entertainments of life; and made his appetite wholly &s;ub&s;ervient to &s;it him for more vigorous exertions, more exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s and elevated glory. He was patient under the mo&s;t &s;evere trials and un|provoked abu&s;es; &s;o that <Q><HI>when he was reviled, he reviled not again: when he &s;uffered he threatened not, but committed him&s;elf to him who judgeth righteou&s;ly.</HI></Q> He was per&s;evering in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t perplexing difficulties and gloomy di&s;couragements, and ro&s;e par|amount to every ob&s;truction, which was thrown in his way, in the
<PB N="6" REF="037199_0006_100D3A5605469218">
&s;alvation of his country: And nothing was able to daunt his cour|age, or move his firm and un&s;haken mind. In battle, he was the determined and invincible warrior: When victorious, the humane friend of peace. Benevolence was a di&s;tingui&s;hing trait in his cha|racter; and he was the generous benefactor of the citizen, the &s;ol|dier, and the pri&s;oner whom the fortune of war ca&s;t into his power. The whole train of cardinal virtues appear to have re&s;ided in our ve|nerable father, in an eminent degree. In his enlarged mind, was combined the wi&s;dom of a &s;enate, and his maje&s;tic pre&s;ence &s;truck with more profound awe than a ho&s;t.</P>
<P>NEITHER are the&s;e &s;plendid virtues, which we have now been contemplating, all that embelli&s;hed our illu&s;trious citizen. In addi|tion to the&s;e, he had others of a &s;uperior nature, which adorned and fini&s;hed his dignified character.</P>
<P>DEEPLY in his heart appears to have been implanted, a &s;upreme veneration for the mo&s;t high God, as well as a tender regard for his fellow-men: And he uniformly attributed all his cau&s;es of martial victory, and political glory, to HIS univer&s;al, beneficent, and over|ruling Providence. His great mind was &s;uperior to modern licen|tious philo&s;ophy; and he readily di&s;cerned, and cordially embrac|ed, the Chri&s;tian religion, as of divine authenticity, and as the on|ly rational &s;y&s;tem of moral truth, upon which guilty mortals can build a permanent hope of immortal life, and eternal &s;alvation.&mdash;Under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, he annexed him&s;elf to the church of Chri&s;t, and avowed his attachment to the glorious go&s;pel. Thro' all the vici&s;&s;itudes of his important life, he uniformly attended the public wor&s;hip of God, with punctuality and reverence; and gave his highe&s;t &s;anction to all the in&s;titutions of religion. And we have ground to believe, that his elevated &s;oul was embelli&s;hed with the
<PB N="7" REF="037199_0007_100D3A579DF01000">
grace of the go&s;pel; and that he was enabled, by the divine influ|ence which he con&s;tantly derived from its author, to maintain that circum&s;pection of conduct, that dignity of character, and maje&s;tic glory, for which he is &s;o univer&s;ally famed. Of &s;uch va&s;t impor|tance did real religion appear to this great and good man, that he inculcated it upon the inhabitants of the United States, in the mo&s;t forcible manner, in his farewell addre&s;s. Hear it, as recorded in that ever-memorable beque&s;t, which he made when he retired from public life; and let it &s;ink deep into our hearts, as the words of a dying father. <Q>Of all the di&s;po&s;itions and habits, (&s;aid he,) which lead to political pro&s;perity, Religion and Morality are indi&s;pen&s;a|ble &s;upports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patri|oti&s;m, who &s;hould labour to &s;ubvert the&s;e great pillars of human happine&s;s, the&s;e firme&s;t props of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to re&s;pect and che|ri&s;h them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it &s;imply be a&s;ked, where is the &s;ecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if a &s;en&s;e of reli|gious obligation de&s;ert the oaths, which are the in&s;truments of in|ve&s;tigation, in courts of ju&s;tice? And let us with caution indulge the &s;uppo&s;ition, that Morality can be maintained without Religion.</Q></P>
<P>SUCH, my Brethren, were the religious &s;entiments of our vene|rable father, which he bequeathed to us, his children, in his la&s;t legacy: And &s;uch, as we have been con&s;idering, were the illu&s;tri|ous a&s;&s;emblage of talents and virtues, which con&s;tituted his amiable character. They were early di&s;covered to re&s;ide in him: And Pre|&s;ident Davis, as if endowed with a prophetic &s;pirit, when preach|ing before the Virginian volunteers, in the year 1755, pointed him out as the probable &s;aviour of his country.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="037199_0008_100D3A5B213C7410">
IN the view of all the&s;e great talents and amiable virtues, which adorned the character of our illu&s;trious citizen, who is now mould|ering in the gloomy grave, we might, with the utmo&s;t propriety, a|dopt the language of our text, and exclaim, <Q><HI>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed!</HI></Q></P>
<P>2. OUR illu&s;trious WASHINGTON, who&s;e death we this day commemorate, was <HI>mighty,</HI> in his PUBLIC TRANSACTIONS and ACHIEVEMENTS.</P>
<P>IN de&s;cribing the&s;e, it will not be expected that a minute de|tail be given. This would far exceed the limits to which we are circum&s;cribed, and would &s;well our di&s;cour&s;e to volumes. All, therefore, that I at pre&s;ent intend, is to give a very general view of the public tran&s;actions and martial achievements of this great man, in order to in&s;tamp his memory more deeply on our hearts, and lead us to &s;uitable mourning and lamentation.</P>
<P>THE &s;uperior talents and &s;plendid virtues with which he was en|dowed by Divine Power, fitted him to &s;hine in public life, and ca|pacitated him for great and mighty achievements. An opportunity pre&s;ented, in the morning of his days, to call them forth into vigor|ous exertion. In 1755, about the twenty-third year of his age, he marched, at the head of the American volunteers, to defend our we&s;tern frontiers, again&s;t the common enemies of our country. In the fore&s;ts of Ohio, in General Braddock's defeat, he di&s;played &s;uch martial &s;kill, &s;uch undaunted bravery and feats of arms, as endeared him to his country, and pointed him out as our ri&s;ing patriot, and invincible hero.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037199_0009_100D3A5D6CEBB1E0">
BUT a far more exten&s;ive and important field was afterwards o+pened for the di&s;play of his great talents and amiable virtues, and which gave full &s;cope for his mighty achievements. When haughty Britain a&s;&s;ailed our rights, and invaded our privileges; when &s;he a&s;|&s;umed an unlimited juri&s;diction over the citizens of America, and de|clared &s;he would bind us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, without our con|&s;ent; when &s;he threatened the &s;ubver&s;ion of both our liberty and re|ligion, by &s;overeign taxation and eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hments; and when our whole country &s;tood fearful and di&s;mayed, trembling at the i&s;&s;ue of &s;uch unbounded u&s;urpation and arbitrary power: Then, O! then it was, that our venerable father, brave patriot, and invin|cible hero, flew to arms, organized our armies, and determined, un|der God, that he would conquer or die. His maje&s;tic pre&s;ence ani|mated our di&s;heartened citizens, and called forth our forces, from every part of the country. He &s;oon taught our hands to war, and our fingers to fight, and led forth our troops into the field of battle. With an army of his &s;ons, though inexperienced in war, yet lovers of liberty and the rights of their country, he attacked and beat the veterans of tyranny, and &s;oon acquired laurels of military glory.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH, in the cour&s;e of our revolutionary war, he was frequently placed in the mo&s;t perplexed &s;ituation, and em|barra&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances; although he was betrayed by &s;ome in whom he confided, and was de&s;erted by others; and although he had every difficulty to encounter, which could originate from &s;canty re&s;ources, unequipped troops, and a formidable foe; yet his great and un&s;haken mind &s;urmounted the whole. He per&s;evered, in &s;pite of every ob&s;tacle which was thrown in his way, in obtaining our freedom and independence. Neither pro&s;perity appeared to elevate, nor adver&s;ity to depre&s;s his &s;pirits: B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> with one calm, unmoved,
<PB N="10" REF="037199_0010_100D3A5FA7B9EC00">
and magnanimous temper of mind, he travelled through the various vici&s;&s;itudes of eight years war; and finally led our youthful, deter|mined, and brave armies&punc; to &s;plendid victory and glory: And per|manently e&s;tabli&s;hed both the liberty and independence of our country.</P>
<P>WHILE the mere recollection of the martial achievements, and public tran&s;actions, of our illu&s;trious father and invincible hero, fires our &s;ouls with veneration and love for his amiable character; how are their ardour damped by the&s;e &s;able en&s;igns and garments of woe with which we are &s;urrounded, and by the irre&s;i&s;tible impre&s;|&s;ion, that &s;o much greatne&s;s and human glory is buried in the du&s;t! "<HI>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed!</HI>"&mdash;Mourn, O ye lofty hills, and embattled plains, which have been witne&s;&s;es to his mighty achievements! Weep, ye American heroes, who have fought and bled at his maje&s;tic &s;ide; for your illu&s;trious leader, and glorious commander, is now no more! Lament, ye Brethren of Ma&s;onic order; for your father, your brother, and the brighte&s;t ornament of your re&s;pectable fraternity, is mouldering in the &s;ilent du&s;t! Grieve, all ye &s;ons and daughters of America, and let tears of &s;orrow &s;tream down every cheek; for the &s;ecu|rer of our rights, the defender of our liberties, and the glory of our land, is &s;hrouded in the gloomy grave!</P>
<P>WERE I to &s;top here, in recounting the public tran&s;actions of this great man, I &s;hould not give you a general view of one half his worth.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner had he accompli&s;hed the great object of his martial career, and pre&s;ented us with our freedom and independence, than
<PB N="11" REF="037199_0011_100D3A61E7E783E0">
he was called to concert, with the patriots and &s;tate&s;men of our country, the be&s;t means for <HI>their</HI> pre&s;ervation and perpetuity. And here his talents and virtues were not le&s;s con&s;picuous than in his for|mer great tran&s;actions. He appeared equally capacitated for fra|ming governments and commanding armies; and he pre&s;ided over, and took an active and deci&s;ive part in, that augu&s;t body which formed the con&s;titution of the United States: A con&s;titution which admirably combines the cla&s;hing intere&s;ts of this exten&s;ive country; which &s;ecures liberty with order; and which is happily calculated to promote the peace, pro&s;perity, and felicity of all cla&s;&s;es of citizens.</P>
<P>NOR did the great tran&s;actions of this good man cea&s;e to &s;hine here. More re&s;plendent glory was yet in re&s;erve, for him, whom God delighted to honour. For as &s;oon as the federal con&s;titution was reduced to form, and adopted by the &s;tates in the union, our venerable father was called to pre&s;ide as chief magi&s;trate of our country, by the unanimous voice of the people. He filled this highe&s;t &s;eat in the we&s;tern world, with the highe&s;t dignity and glo|ry; and admini&s;tered the government of the United States with an inexplicable mixture of mildne&s;s and energy. He adhered, with the utmo&s;t fidelity, to the con&s;titution of our government, and ne|ver di&s;covered the lea&s;t ambition to overleap the bounds there pre|&s;cribed him. And he appeared uniformly to &s;tudy the peace, pro&s;|perity, and happine&s;s of his country; and con&s;tantly exerted his great talents, during the whole cour&s;e of his civil admini&s;tration, to rai&s;e our infant empire to re&s;pectability, dignity, and glory.</P>
<P>IN this elevated &s;ituation, he was grave, plain, and acce&s;&s;ible. His great mind was &s;uperior to the regalia and haughtine&s;s of kings, and the &s;plendid trappings and pomp of courts. And his virtuous
<PB N="12" REF="037199_0012_100D3A6599AF1A90">
&s;oul &s;eemed never to de&s;ire to avail him&s;elf of any per&s;onal or do|me&s;tic advantage, from all his victory and glory. He loved his country;&mdash;therefore he endured the mo&s;t painful toil, and laborious fatigue, and fought for her liberty and independence. He loved his people;&mdash;therefore he governed them with moderation and ju&s;tice, with mildne&s;s and energy, and uniformly fought their highe&s;t inter|e&s;t. While he was at the helm, under God, we were always &s;e|cure, in the mid&s;t of the tempe&s;tuous political ocean. He rode out the &s;torm of both foreign and dome&s;tic faction&mdash;&s;teered us &s;afely through the raging billows of European commotion&mdash;and retired from the chief magi&s;tracy of his exten&s;ive country, loaded with lau|rels of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate earthly glory.</P>
<P>3. OUR illu&s;trious WASHINGTON, who&s;e death we this day commemorate, was <HI>mighty</HI> in his PRIVATE CHARACTER and LIFE.</P>
<P>AFTER our venerable father retired from the great theatre of public life, to which he had been repeatedly called by the general voice of his country, he cheerfully &s;at him&s;elf down as a private citizen, to enjoy that freedom and independence for which he had &s;o nobly fought, and to &s;ubmit to tho&s;e laws, which he him&s;elf had &s;anctioned. In this &s;ituation, as a private citizen, he did not wa&s;te away the re&s;idue of his days in rounds of luxury and di&s;&s;ipation, like the heroes and &s;tate&s;men of antiquity; but he employed his time in promoting dome&s;tic and &s;ocial happine&s;s, and advancing the inter|e&s;ts of his country; and actually engaged, when again &s;olicited, to become the commander and leader, of her armies. His private character, as far as I am acquainted, is as &s;potle&s;s and dignified as his public life. He was the affectionate hu&s;band&mdash;the tender parent&mdash;the obliging neighbour&mdash;and generous friend; as well as the in+vincible
<PB N="13" REF="037199_0013_100D3A67D7DF1D50">
hero&mdash;the wi&s;e legi&s;lator&mdash;and great &s;tate&s;man. Of him, it may be mo&s;t-emphatically &s;aid, <Q><HI>When the ear heard him, then it ble&s;&s;ed him; and when the eye &s;aw him, it gave witne&s;s to him; be|cau&s;e he delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherle&s;s, and him who had none to help him. The ble&s;&s;ing of him who was ready to peri&s;h came upon him; and he cau&s;ed the widow's heart to &s;hout for joy. He was eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, a father to the poor, and the cau&s;e which he knew not he &s;earched out; and he break eve|ry yoke.</HI></Q></P>
<P>NOR were his moral and religious character le&s;s amiable, than his political and military were great. He appears obviou&s;ly to have been endowed with that <Q><HI>wi&s;dom which cometh down from above; which is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gentle, ea&s;y to be entreated, without partiality, and without hypocri&s;y, full of mercy and good fruits. He walked not in the coun&s;el of the ungodly, nor &s;tood in the way of &s;inners, nor &s;at in the &s;eat of the &s;cornful; but his delight was in the law of the Lord,</HI></Q> and his happine&s;s to do good to men.</P>
<P>THE clo&s;e of his life was doubtle&s;s &s;pent, as he intimates in his farewell addre&s;s, in preparing for his approaching di&s;&s;olution. For he was well apprized, that notwith&s;tanding all his greatne&s;s and glo|ry, he was a frail mortal, and mu&s;t &s;oon mingle with his original du&s;t. He was thoroughly convinced that he was a dependant crea|ture, that he was an accountable being, who &s;tood in need of ever|la&s;ting &s;alvation; and that he was de&s;tined for a boundle&s;s eternity. To prepare for this, he retired from the bu&s;y &s;cences of human life, to his peaceful abode at Mount Vernon; where he died, in the <HI>&s;ix|ty-eighth</HI> year of his age, with the &s;ame greatne&s;s of mind with which he lived: And from whence, we have good ground to be|lieve, that his immortal &s;pirit has been e&s;corted by &s;hining Angels, to the regions of cele&s;tial glory.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="037199_0014_100D3A6A0F5CE068">
THUS terminated the life of our illu&s;trious WASHINGTON, who&s;e <HI>per&s;onal talents</HI> and <HI>virtues</HI>&mdash;who&s;e <HI>public tran&s;actions</HI> and <HI>achievements</HI>&mdash;and who&s;e <HI>private character</HI> and <HI>life,</HI> are without a pa|rallel. As he was human, he was liable to the frailties and imper|fections of our degenerate nature. But whatever the&s;e were, they were few in him, when contra&s;ted tho&s;e with which are u&s;ually at|tached to great political and military characters; and are all &s;wallow|ed up in the effulgence of his virtues and excellencies.</P>
<P>IN him were combined the Hero&mdash;the State&s;man&mdash;the Patriot&mdash;and the Chri&s;tian. A rare a&s;&s;emblage in a human character! He was the light of our councils&mdash;the ornament of our church&mdash;the bulwark of our land&mdash;and the glory of the world.</P>
<P>BUT I dare not attempt his eulogium&mdash;Every tran&s;action of his life&mdash;and the world, will re&s;ound his prai&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding all his greatne&s;s, maje&s;ty, and glory; he is fallen! he is fallen a victim to death! <Q><HI>How are the mighty fall|en, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed! The beauty of America is &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ain upon the high places. Ye Mount of Vernon, let there be no dew, neither rain, upon you; for there the &s;hield of the mighty is de|po&s;ited. Ye &s;ons and daughters of America, weep over our illu&s;tri|ous</HI> WASHINGTON, <HI>who is with us no more!</HI></Q></P>
<P>IN reviewing our &s;ubject, and reducing it to practical improve|ment, no per&s;on in this a&s;&s;embly, I am per&s;uaded, can refrain from mourning the lo&s;s of &s;o great and good a man. But while we give vent to all the feelings of our overwhelmed &s;pirits, on this mournful and &s;olemn occa&s;ion; let us weep like Chri&s;tians, with a holy re|&s;ignation to the will of Heaven. Let us be thankful to the &s;overeign
<PB N="15" REF="037199_0015_100D3A6C9870ED70">
of the univer&s;e, that he rai&s;ed up &s;uch an eminent character among our&s;elves, furni&s;hed him with &s;uch illu&s;trious talents, and continued him &s;o long &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hing ble&s;&s;ing to this exten&s;ive country. Let us ble&s;s God, that he did not die by the hand of &s;ome cruel ty|rant, or fall victim to &s;ome inhuman mercenary; but that he ex|pired at his own peaceful retreat, &s;urrounded with his affectionate friends, and furni&s;hed with every accommodation which could alle|viate the agonies of di&s;&s;olving nature, and facilitate his tran&s;ition out of time into eternity. O! let us prai&s;e the eternal Jehovah, that we have &s;uch good foundation to hope, that he was fitted for, and has winged his way to brighter regions beyond the &s;kies; where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and the weary are at re&s;t; and where he is joining the holy heroes and patriots of I&s;rael, in ex|claiming <Q><HI>unto him who loved us, and wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and prie&s;ts unto God; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.</HI></Q></P>
<P>2. IN improving our &s;ubject, let us all be led to realize that we are mortal, and mu&s;t &s;hortly die. If our illu&s;trious father, after all his u&s;efulne&s;s, greatne&s;s, and glory, has fallen a victim to the king of terrors; who among us can expect to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">? Whatever talents and virtues we may any of us po&s;&s;e&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> u&s;eful we may have been to our country; with whatev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lendour and wealth we may be &s;urrounded; and however elevated may be our &s;ituation in life; yet we are con&s;tantly liable to the arre&s;t of death, and may be &s;uddenly hurried into a boundle&s;s eternity. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the lamenta|ble ca&s;e of our illu&s;trious friend, who&s;e death we this day deplore. While we, therefore, mourn his &s;udden death, with hearts of hum|ble and genuine &s;orrow; let us wi&s;ely improve this melancholy providence, to prepare us for our approaching di&s;&s;olution. Let us look with a holy indifference on all human glory and learn to view it as fading and &s;wiftly pa&s;&s;ing away. And let us be anxiou&s;ly &s;oli|citous, to &s;ecure an intere&s;t in that immortal &s;plendour in the king|dom of Heaven, which is in re&s;erve for all the followers of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us; and which will increa&s;e and brighten throughout all eternity.</P>
<P>3. LET our &s;ubject excite within us, a high emulation to im|itate the dignified example of our illu&s;trious citizen. Like him, let us employ our time and our talents for the mo&s;t important

and dignified purpo&s;es. Like him, let us devote our&s;elves to the &s;ervice of God and our country; and uniformly maintain a pro|found veneration for the one, while we are engaged in promo|ting the highe&s;t intere&s;t of the other. Like him, let us be hum|ble, temperate, patient, and per&s;evering; and cheri&s;h and exerci&s;e the whole train of cardinal virtues. Like him, let us cautiou&s;|ly avoid modern philo&s;ophy, and adhere to the Chri&s;tian religion; and cordially embrace its divine author, as the only foundation of our eternal &s;alvation. And, like him, let us uniformly counte|nance, and &s;olemnly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon, all the in&s;titutions of the go&s;pel, and &s;ee that our &s;ouls are embelli&s;hed with its divine grace, if ever we expect to be formed for great and dignified tran&s;actions. Copy after his great example, in both your public tran&s;actions and private life; and &s;teadily follow his illumined path, to u&s;efulne&s;s, to honour, and glory. And then, like him, you will be re&s;pected and loved while you live; you will be lamented when you die; and will dwell for ever with him, in the &s;ame bright regions of elevated joy and everla&s;ting felicity.</P>
