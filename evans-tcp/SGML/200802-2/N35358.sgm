<P>SOME years ago there was in England a company of foot-pads and highway-men, connected to|gether under certain laws and regulations, having a language (and books printed in that language) pe|culiar to them&s;elves, called the Fla&s;h Company,&mdash;a &s;imilar gang of plunderers has infe&s;ted the United-States ever &s;ince the late war; and almo&s;t all the per&s;ons who have been hanged of late in North-America, have belonged to this company. Of this company are the two convicts <HI>Thomas Mount</HI> and <HI>James Williams,</HI> now lying in Newport gaol under &s;entence of death, for burglary. Both of the&s;e are noted villains, as well by legal evidence as their own confe&s;&s;ion; and were there no others, the&s;e were &s;ufficient to contaminate all the unwary youth up|on the continent, and to deprive the good people of the&s;e States of one of the highe&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of heaven, that of &s;itting quietly under their vine and under their fig-tree and none to make them afraid. <HI>Wil|liams,</HI> whether from artifice or an inferior degree of guilt, has not divulged the Fla&s;h proceedings near &s;o fully as <HI>Mount,</HI> who&s;e information, therefore, is the &s;ubject matter of the following &s;heets, and this is the cau&s;e why <HI>Williams'</HI> name occurs &s;o &s;eldom here. The di&s;cerning public will readily &s;ee my motives for handing the&s;e papers to them.

<HEAD>The Voluntary Confe&s;&s;ion of Thomas Mount.</HEAD>
<P>I THOMAS MOUNT, now under &s;entence of death in the gaol of Newport, and to be executed agreeable to my &s;en|tence, at Little-Re&s;t, on the 27th of this month of May&mdash; in bodily health and &s;ound mind, and full of &s;orrow and regret for my wicked life, in &s;incerity and truth make the following confe&s;&s;ion:</P>
<P>My parents, Samuel Mount and Mary Dobbs, lived in Mid|dletown, in Ea&s;t-Jer&s;ey, where I was born &s;ome time, I believe, in 1764. My father, for the benefit of his family, removed to New-York when I was about four or five years old, where I and my brothers were put to &s;chool; they, viz. Adam and Jo&s;eph, now living in good repute in New-York, profited in their &s;tudies &mdash;I played truant, hated learning and every &s;ort of good in&s;truc|tion. upon Sundays e&s;pecially was fond of doing mi&s;chief &s;uch as robbing orchards, and &s;preading my wicked example among all the boys I could get acquainted with.&mdash;I began to de&s;pi&s;e my parents, and to count every thing they &s;aid to, or did for me, as beneath my regard; and having never learned to know my duty, either towards God, or towards man, or my&s;elf, I de&s;pi&s;ed all religion; and at the age of 10 or 11, quitted my parents, who often told me I &s;hould one day come to an evil end, and went to &s;ea on board one Capt. Hammond, bound for Antigua, thence to Statia, Navis, St. Kitts, Santacruiz, Sanctakes and Savannah. At Savannah I left him, and went on board the Florida brig bound for Jamaica; then I left him and went to live with one Mr. Kennedy in King&s;town, with him I lived about five or &s;ix weeks, then left him and got aboard of a &s;loop Capt. Alboy, and returned in her to New-York. In 1775, the war breaking out, I quitted my parents again, and li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted with Capt. Palmer, and went with him to Albany, thence to Fort George, thence to Ti|conderoga, thence to Crown-Point, thence to St. John's, thence to Montreal, thence returned to Albany, and being &s;ick was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed. As &s;oon as I recovered, I lifted again, and went to Fort George, where I remained five weeks, and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed on ac|count of my youth, &s;o I returned to live with my parents, at New-York. Not reli&s;hing the good rules and advice of my par|ents,
<PB N="4" REF="046227_0004_1020FDEFA1CF4600">
again I left them and went to live with one John Mino<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, at Stonnington-point, with whom I remained &s;ix or &s;even months; when he was drafted to go with the militia&mdash;I propo&s;ed to go in his &s;tead; accordingly went, and at Groton, near New-London, availing my&s;elf of the privileges of a militia man, I li&s;ted in the continental army under Col. Huntington, and accompanied him to Denbigh, when the Briti&s;h troops landed and burnt it.&mdash;At Valley-Ford, in Penn&s;ylvania, I de&s;erted the American, and went over to the Briti&s;h army, then lying in Philadelphia. In a few days after this, I and two companions broke into a &s;oap-boilers' &s;tore (this is my fir&s;t act of theft) and &s;tole &s;ome &s;oap. When the Briti&s;h troops left Philadelphia, I came along with them through the Jer&s;ies, to New-York, thence to Staten-I&s;land, where I broke open a &s;tore in the night &s;oon after our arrival, and took a large quantity of goods, and about twenty dollars in ca&s;h, and the night following I broke into the &s;ame &s;tore and took a larger quantity of goods than I had done the former night. Determin|ed to de&s;ert for fear of a di&s;covery, I and two of my companions confined the corporal that commanded the patrol, and &s;o we e&s;|caped and went off to the American army, into the Jer&s;ies.&mdash; With my uncle Jo&s;eph Cox, at Embley's-Town, who married my father's &s;i&s;ter, I remained &s;ome weeks; but &s;oon wearied of this too quiet &s;ort of life, I left my uncle and went to Philadelphia where I entered on board a &s;chooner, Captain Strong, bound to Cape-Francois from whence I returned &s;afe to Philadelphia; and in about four weeks after my return I entered again on board the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el, and then run off with the advanced pay, and entered on board the St. James, Capt. King, and cheated him of a month's advanced pay; next entered on board the Plow brig, Capt. Brow&s;ter, with whom I went to &s;ea, and in 24 hours were taken by the Cyble frigate, carried into New-York and put on board the Jer&s;ey pri&s;on-&s;hip, from whence in about eleven or twelve days I e&s;caped to New-York, where I entered on board the Macaroni privateer, and cheated the Captain of four or five guineas, the advance money. In a day or two after this I en|tered on board a &s;chooner, received the advance money and made off with it. Next I was apprehended by the Briti&s;h regiment (the fourth battalion of Jer&s;ey volunteers) to which I formerly belong|ed; and was brought before a court-martial, but received no puni&s;hment on account of my youth. Under no re&s;traint, and already hardened by the e&s;capes I had made, I determined to double my diligence, if po&s;&s;ible to arrive at the head of my pro|fe&s;&s;ion; accordingly, next &s;tole a watch from one Mr. Kelly;

The regiment now removing to Newtown, on Long-I&s;land, I went with them, and in a few days after our ar|rival, I and one Henry Milton &s;tole two hor&s;es and rode off with them to Brookland, and then let them go; next day after we came to Brookland, we were apprehended and carried back to the regiment and tried for de&s;ertion: Henry Milton was acquitted, and I &s;entenced to receive 500 la&s;hes; but the day before my puni&s;hment commenced, I broke out of the guard-hou&s;e, and e&s;|caped to the ea&s;t end of the i&s;land, but there was taken up by Colonel Thom&s;on's light hor&s;e, and carried to Huntington, thence under guard to Jerico, there committed to the care of one of the Yougers to carry me to the regiment.&mdash;The Youger's pocket I picked, as he &s;at by me in the waggon, and threw all his papers down on the road within five or &s;ix miles of Jamaica; &s;ome time after we came out of the carriage at Jamaica, I told him that I &s;aw the driver pick his pockets and take all his papers and throw them down on the highway, about five or &s;ix miles from hence. Seeing the waggon at &s;ome con&s;iderable di&s;tance, the Youger, de&s;iring me to follow him, pur&s;ued after the wag|goner, that in&s;tant I took a contrary direction and &s;o e&s;caped. I went down as far as South-Hole and then got over in a trading boat to the main, and travelled towards New-Haven, there one day went into a &s;hop and &s;tole out of a drawer a &s;mall quantity of ca&s;h; next day, out of another &s;tore, I &s;tole from the ca&s;h-box five or &s;ix crowns and dollars with two French guines; &s;ame day in the afternoon I went into another &s;hop and &s;tole about ten pounds in &s;ilver and one Engli&s;h guinea. Leaving this place, I &s;et off for Philadelphia, where I li&s;ted into Col. Myland's light-hor&s;e, he fourth regiment of dragoons: &s;oon after this peace took place, I quitted the army entirely. Immediately after my leaving the army, I broke open

a continental &s;tore, and &s;tole two pair of boots, and a parcel of &s;hirts; a few days after I &s;tole a piece of calico, thirty yards, in company with James Daw&s;on; &s;ome little time after this, I &s;tole from a kitchen door a &s;ilver tankard belonging to Mr. Penro&s;e,&mdash; it was in&s;tantly mi&s;&s;ed; Daw&s;on had cut it up, but one of the Captains of the garri&s;on intercepted it, and Daw&s;on and I were taken up and tried for the theft; he got 25 la&s;hes, and I 100 la&s;hes for the theft, and 25 for giving the court &s;aucy an&s;wers. No &s;ooner was this account &s;ettled, but I proceeded in my old way, and &s;tole three large &s;ilver &s;poons from Mr. Jo&s;eph Car&s;on, in Water-Street; next day or &s;o, in the evening, I went into an apothecary's &s;hop and took his ca&s;h-box, containing about ten pounds; a week after this I went into a &s;hop in&mdash;&s;treet, and took another piece of calico; &s;ome days after I was taken up for a debt I owed to Mr. Car&s;on and put in gaol; whil&s;t in gaol, the woman to whom I and Daw&s;on had &s;old the calico, which I &s;tole from Mr. Pool, was apprehended, having on a gown of it, in|formed that &s;he had bought it of me, accordingly I was tried for the theft and received 21 la&s;hes, and &s;entenced to impri&s;onment for court charges of fine and re&s;titution money; the very &s;econd day after I broke gaol and e&s;caped, I picked the pocket of one Hag|gaty or about three or four dollars and two depreciation notes of about &s;ixty pounds each; leaving Philadelphia, I went to Bur|lington, and there pa&s;&s;ed the notes; thence went to New York, and lived with my brother Adam about one or two months at the baking bu&s;ine&s;s; here I got acquainted with John Lipton, and we broke open a hen-roo&s;t and &s;tole a parcel of fowls; next day leaving New-York, we went upon Long-I&s;land, thence to O&s;tend, and &s;o on to New-London; upon the road Lipton &s;tole a watch, but the owner mi&s;&s;ing it, pur&s;ued us, and we in a very cowardly manner give it up to him. We journeyed to Sagg-Harbor, thence cro&s;&s;ed over to New-London, and from thence to Bo&s;ton; there the fir&s;t day of our arrival we &s;tole a few articles, &s;uch as &s;hoes, and other wearables; but finding Bo&s;ton no proper place for us then, on account of the alarms about &s;tolen goods before our arrival, we &s;et out to go back to New-York. &mdash;Having travelled about twelve or fourteen miles from Bo&s;ton, in the night we broke open a &s;tore that &s;tood upon the road, and took &s;ome ca&s;h and twenty five pair of women's &s;hoes, a large quantity of nutmeg and a gun; and travelling along with our booty, we came up to a waggon with a trunk of goods tied on it, &s;tanding at a tavern door, we broke open the trunk and taking out of it a large quantity of chintz, laces, &s;ilk and cotton hankerchiefs, we left in their &s;tead the &s;hoes and gun;
<PB N="7" REF="046227_0007_1020FDF951A476D8">
our next &s;tep was to &s;ecure our flight, by taking two hor&s;es out of the &s;table at the &s;ame place, and rode the remainder of the night, and in the morning turned them off, whil&s;t we retired to the woods during the day; and when night came on we pur&s;ued our journey toward Worce&s;ter; but hearing a waggon behind us, we went out of the road a little till it &s;hould go pa&s;t us, we fixed our eye upon it, and &s;aw one man only in it and he &s;eemed to be a&s;leep; the waggon &s;oon &s;topt, we &s;uppo&s;e at the onwers' hou&s;e, &s;traitway we made up to it, robbed the &s;leeping man of all he had, about four or five dollars, and left him &s;ound a&s;leep to pur&s;ue our journey, &s;elling our goods after the be&s;t manner we could, pretending to be &s;peculating &s;ailors, till we arrived at New-York. Soon after our arrival at New-York, we li&s;ted with the troops de&s;tined for the Ohio expedition; the &s;econd or third night after our enli&s;tment, we broke open a dwelling-hou&s;e belonging to Mr. Hyde, where Lipton formerly lived, and took a &s;ilver watch, a guinea, &s;ome &s;mall money, and a &s;ilver &s;tock buckle; a few nights after being informed by one Millar, who&s;e right name was Copy Gelly, that there was money in a hou&s;e clo&s;e by Mr. Lither's &s;hip-yard, Millar, Lipton and I broke into this hou&s;e, took a watch, and a pair of &s;ilver buckles, but were di&s;covered ju&s;t as we were ready to &s;eize upon the mo|ney, yet we e&s;caped. Having now received the bounty and our clothes, we de&s;erted from the regiment, and we three, viz. Lipton, Millar and I, went out about five or &s;ix miles from New-York, and there Millar went down a chimney and &s;tole a watch, and handed it to me through a window. Our next route was to|wards New-Haven, and within about four or five miles of New-Haven, we broke into a dwelling-hou&s;e where a phy&s;ician lived, at the &s;ign of the ball, here we took &s;ome money and departed; thence to Hartford, here we li&s;ted with the troops going again&s;t the Indians with Capt. Hart; we received the bounty-money, and in two or three days de&s;erted. Lipton cho&s;e to re|main a little while at Hartford; Millar and I &s;et off for Bo&s;ton. Within about four or five miles of Providence we broke into a dwelling-hou&s;e and &s;tole &s;ome &s;ilver &s;poons, then &s;trait to Provi|dence; and the very &s;ame night broke into a dwelling-hou&s;e near Mr. Sterry's hou&s;e and took a large &s;ilver &s;poon and a quantity of clothes; and next day leaving Providence, &s;et out for Bo&s;ton: here we went to board with Mrs. Ritch, and when ready to leave her, we &s;tole from her a pattern of a &s;ilk and cotton jacket, and &s;et off for Dedham, where we broke open the dwelling-hou&s;e of Mr. Newall, and &s;tole a large quantity dry goods, for which we were apprehended and tried, and being found guilty, received 30

la&s;hes, I was put upon the gallows one hour with a rope round my neck, and &s;ent to Ca&s;tle-William for three years. After about eighteen months confinement, in a foggy day I e&s;caped from thence by &s;wimming three miles, and ju&s;t as I was approaching the wharves a boat took me up, with an intention of delivering me up to the Ca&s;tle, from whence they &s;uppo&s;ed I had e&s;caped; a little after we were on &s;hore, and being favoured by the dark|ne&s;s of the night, I run off from them. Next day I arrived at Providence, and got into employ with one Capt. De Wolf, late from Guinea; &s;oon left him, and &s;et out for Norwich Landing, where I fell in with an old companion, Archibald Taylor (&s;ince executed in Bo&s;ton) and nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> day &s;etting out for Bo&s;ton, upon the road we robbed a woman of a gold earlock and a &s;ilk handker|chief, and u&s;ed her very ill be&s;ides; a few miles further on the road, I &s;tole a gold ring and a tortoi&s;e &s;hell &s;ilver mounted fan, in Plainfield; here we changed our minds, and returned to Nor|wich Landing, where I &s;tole a &s;urtout; the fir&s;t night after our return we broke into a &s;tore belonging to Mr. Devitt, and took about &s;eventy or eighty pounds worth of dry goods; took the goods along and &s;et off for New-London, and within two or three miles of that place; hid the greate&s;t part of them in Mr. Par&s;on's barn among hay: at New-London we were both apprehended on &s;u&s;picion, I having the art of repre&s;enting my&s;elf innocent got clear, but my companion was confined in gaol. Being &s;et at lib|erty, I went to Mr. Par&s;on's hou&s;e, where I &s;taid two or three days, and &s;et off one evening towards New-York with a part of the goods, which I di&s;po&s;ed of by the way. As &s;oon as my mo|ney was &s;pent, in New-York, I left that place and &s;et off to go back to Mr. Par&s;on's for the re&s;t of the goods; at Milford I got a companion to go with me, one John Delavan, we found the goods ju&s;t as I had left them, and &s;et out with them to New-Ha|ven, where we tarried a few days; in the mean time Dela|van received from me a part of the goods for his trouble; and making free to &s;teal more of them made off with them to his hou&s;e at Milford. In a day or two after De|lavan left me, having &s;old the re&s;t of the goods to different people, I and one Harry M'Cormic hired a boat to carry us to Milford; we run her a&s;hore among the rocks, and before morn|ing &s;he &s;tove all to pieces; from hence walking to Milford, I called upon Delavan, made him deliver up to me &s;uch goods as he had not &s;old. Leaving Milford, M'Cormic and I &s;at out for New-York, where in two or three days we fell in with another of our companions, George Gardiner (from Greenock, a famous key-maker.) Ju&s;t before leaving New-York, where M'Cormic
<PB N="9" REF="046227_0009_1020FDFED1A6A958">
&s;tayed behind, I called on my brother Adam and received about four dollars from him; prepared for our journey, we then &s;et out for Philadelphia, where next day after our arrival, Gardiner and I opened a barber's &s;hop in Water-&s;treet, with a fal&s;e key, and &s;tole razors, tooth drawers, &amp;c. next day I &s;tole &s;ome paper money; &s;ome days after fell in with John Lipton and Daniel Kalaghan; by agreement we four &s;et out for Baltimore, upon our way through Charle&s;ton, there, with a fal&s;e key, opened a &s;tore, and took about twenty pounds worth of goods; we carried them as far as Su&s;quehanna ferry and there hid them, and pur|&s;ued our journey. At Bu&s;htown we attempted to break open a &s;tore, but were di&s;covered, yet we e&s;caped. Arrived in Baltimore, we fell in with our old friend Holmes, and on the third day after Holmes and I went to fetch the goods we had hid at Su&s;|quehanna ferry; we found them as I left them, and returned, &s;elling them by the way. In Baltimore I &s;tole a watch and a &s;urtout out of a hou&s;e; a few nights after we broke open a hou&s;e and &s;tole a large quantity of clothing and a piece of broadcloath. Gardiner and Kalaghan cho&s;e to remain in Baltimore, whil&s;t I and Lipton &s;hould &s;et off for Annapolis and &s;ell the goods we had upon hand: At Annapolis Lipton was apprehended for breaking open the &s;tore in Baltimore and impri&s;oned. Before I left Annapolis, to mend my luck, I &s;tole &s;ome black ribbon and a few more trifles. Again Kalaghan joined me, and another companion (I cannot remember his name.) We three &s;et out for Alexandria, where I fell in with James Brown; he and I one day &s;tole &s;ome &s;ilk handkerchiefs and a beaver hat; next day Gardiner and Stewart joined us; they had fled from Alexandria, where they broke into a &s;hop and had taken a large quantity of goods, and hid them; next day they went for the goods they had hid, and we all four in company &s;et out for Dumfries, where I and Stewart were apprehended and all the fal&s;e keys found with us. Gardiner and Brown e&s;caped, Stewart and I were thrown into Dumfries gaol, and thence carried to Alexan|dria. We were tried, and nothing found again&s;t us, neverthe|le&s;s we were all &s;entenced to lie in gaol a year and a day, or get &s;ome one to be &s;urety for our good behaviour. In the &s;econd week of our impri&s;onment we broke gaol: At Wilmington, on our way to Philadelphia, we broke into a dwelling-hou&s;e and &s;tole a great many things, next day were apprehended and &s;ent to Newca&s;tle gaol, from whence in two or three weeks, we e&s;caped. Arrived at Philadelphia, I left Stewart and took another com|ponion, one Griffin, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome counterfeit New-York money, &s;tole &s;ome handkerchiefs, a beaver hat, a &s;urtout, and two &s;hawls, from different &s;hops; next, in company with Griffin and one

Fogg, in the night time, broke into a &s;tore and took chee&s;e, &s;ugar, coffee, and &s;everal other grocery goods. Fogg was ap|prehended, Griffin and I e&s;caped, and quickly leaving Philadel|phia, we &s;et off for New-York: On our way, at Perthamboy, we &s;tole &s;ome black &s;ilk handkerchiefs. Arrived at New-York, Griffin, John Taylor and I broke into a &s;tore belonging to Mr. Ford, and took a large quantity of &s;hoes, tea, cherry-rum, &amp;c. next day, for this tran&s;action, we were all apprehended and tried; I got clear, my companions were branded, getting the benefit of clergy, and &s;o were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Then Ford &s;wore his life again&s;t me, and got me &s;hut up in pri&s;on about eight or nine months: I got out upon condition of quitting the place in twelve hours, and returned to Philadelphia, where, next day after my arrival, I &s;tole a piece of chintz and a piece of calico, from a &s;tore in Market Street; a few nights after I and David Griffin, and one Logan, a tailor, in Iri&s;htown, broke open a dwelling-hou&s;e in Walnut-Street, and &s;tole a large quan|tity of dry goods; next day I and Griffin were apprehended, the goods were found where we had hidden them in a church then building; I and Griffin were committed to gaol; next day after our impri&s;onment, a man appeared who &s;wore high-way robbery again&s;t me, which I was innocent of. After being confined about eight weeks I broke out, and in company with George Williams and Daniel Kalaghan &s;et off to pa&s;s through the Jer&s;ies; upon our way &s;tole &s;ome money, about two dollars, from a man into who&s;e hou&s;e we had gone to re&s;t our|&s;elves; and in Allentown we attempted to break open a &s;tore, but did not &s;ucceed; thence to Middletown, cro&s;&s;ed over to Long-I&s;land; thence to Huntington; thence to Norwalk, where we three broke open a &s;chooner and &s;tole &s;ome clothes; on the &s;ame night broke open a &s;tore belonging to Squire Lockhart in Norwalk, from whence we took about &s;eventy or eighty pounds in goods and &s;ome &s;ilver buckles, and about two pounds in ca&s;h; next day we were apprehended and tried, fir&s;t for robbing the &s;chooner; I and Kalaghan were found guilty and received 10 la&s;hes a piece, Williams got clear; and then we were all three com|mitted to Fairfield gaol, and tried for breaking open the &s;tore. I took all the blame upon my&s;elf and cleared the other two, and received the puni&s;hment, 35 la&s;hes and five years impri&s;onment. Eight or nine days after my whipping broke out of gaol, and I, Kalaghan, Kennedy and Williams &s;et off for Norwich Landing, with an intention of breaking open a &s;tore, but did not &s;ucceed. Upon the way we &s;tole &s;ome &s;hirts and trow&s;ers, and then we parted, Kalaghan and Kennedy took the road for Providence,

Williams and I to Norwich Landing; and at a dance in Nor|wich Landing I took a &s;ilk cloak from a young lady, and &s;old it about two or three miles from Pockatanock bridge, and then &s;et off for Providence; here I &s;tayed and wrought a week or two with Mr. Brown, under the name of Charles Minor; then leav|ing Providence I &s;et off for Bo&s;ton, where I fell in company with James Williams, for the fir&s;t time of our connection. I &s;tole &s;ome buckles, and then, in company with Williams, &s;et out for Newbury-Port, there I broke open a &s;chooner, and took out of her &s;ome clothes, chocolate, and tobacco, and a bottle of rum; Williams &s;tood upon the wharf and helped to take the things, we then &s;et off for Port&s;mouth, and on the way I &s;tole an axe and &s;old it for a pair of &s;hoes. At Port&s;mouth I left Williams, and returned to Newbury-Port, there I fell in company with one Mr. Farrington, a gentleman thief: Next night we two broke open a dwelling-hou&s;e, and took &s;ome &s;ilk gowns and womens ap|parel out of it; there I got apprehended on account of robbing a brig in Port&s;mouth, having part of the goods with me that were taken out of her by Williams, I was confined two or three days in gaol and then liberated. Leaving Newbury-Port I &s;et off for Bo&s;ton alone, where I broke open a &s;chooner and took a parcel of clothes out of her; from thence returned to Providence, where I fell in company with John Hickcock. Leaving Provi|dence in a few days, we two &s;et off for Norwich Landing, there we attempted to break open a &s;tore, and while I was lifting up Hickcock in at the window, the gentleman of the hou&s;e alarmed us and we e&s;caped: From thence we went to New-London, where we broke open a &s;tore and took &s;ome money, twenty or thirty &s;hillings, and &s;ome cotton and &s;ilk handkerchiefs, &amp;c. and then &s;et off for Newport and &s;old &s;ome of the goods in Newport; here Hickcock and Weathers broke open a &s;tore belonging to Mr. John Hadwen; for this I was apprehended and committed to gaol for two or three days, then was cleared, and &s;et off for Hartford, upon the way I attempted to break open a hou&s;e in Stonington, but being di&s;covered I fled out of town to Hartford, thence returned towards Providence, upon the way broke open a dwelling-hou&s;e in Connecticut, and &s;tole &s;ome &s;ilver and pew|ter &s;poons, a hat and a tankard Carrying the goods with me I arrived at Providence and &s;old them; here I worked with Mr. Brown a week or two under the name of Charles Minor; then I &s;tole a pair of &s;hoes out of Mr. Roger's &s;tore where I had gone to receive my pay; next I went to Nancy Smith and told her I was a fortune-teller, and repeating &s;everal things that I had heard of her, &s;he thought I was really a fortune-teller; then I

Leaving Providence with the advance money, I &s;et off for Bo&s;ton, there I took &s;ome &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s; from thence I went to Newbury-Port, where I fell in company with a young &s;ailor going to vi&s;it his friends, carrying &s;ome handkerchiefs and &s;hawls, we walked together about 14 or 15 miles, and at night we put up at Mr. Lovet's tavern betwixt Newbury-Port and Port&s;mouth; in the night I got up and robbed him of all he had, I took a|bout four or five dollars in ca&s;h, a piece of calico, and two or three &s;hawls, a pair of new &s;tocklngs, a pair of new &s;hoes, a pair of new buckles, a pair of new trow&s;ers, a new &s;hirt, and a beaver hat, a cotton and &s;ilk jacket, and a &s;ilk &s;triped jacket, a pot of &s;weet pomatum, two books and two letters, and a parcel of oranges; from thence I went to Bo&s;ton by the way of Exeter; arrived in Bo&s;ton, I fell in company with Robert Tre&s;&s;on and Thomas Sheridan, where I took one or two &s;hawls, and &s;et out from Bo&s;ton to go to Connecticut, about ten miles from Pom|fret, Tre&s;&s;on and I attempted to rob a hou&s;e, but were di&s;ap|pointed; then on we went to Pomfret, where we all three were concerned in robbing a waggon, and took two pieces of home|made bear&s;kin, and on the &s;ame night broke open a black&s;mith's &s;hop, and got &s;ome tools wherewith to break open a &s;tore belong|ing to Lemming Gro&s;vernor, took about 110 pounds worth in goods, and about two or three dollars in ca&s;h, then &s;et off to Norwich Landing; about two miles from Norwich Landing, one Mount&s;eer lives, who is known to this &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s, there we got apprehended, and &s;ent to Windham gaol; Sherridan turned evidence again&s;t us, and we were tried and found guilty, and I received 40 la&s;hes and to be impri&s;oned &s;ix months, Tre&s;&s;on 30, and to be impri&s;oned three months: Within the fir&s;t two months of our impri&s;onment, Robert Tre&s;&s;on, William Stanton, Ger&s;hom Palmer and I, being all in one apartment, broke gaol.

we three &s;et off for Port&s;mouth; there we attempted to rob a &s;tore, but a fire breaking out in the town at that in&s;tant, prevented us; hearing the fire called we ran to where the fire was, there Tre&s;&s;on &s;tole a jacket from Oliver Whipple, E&s;q. in the pockets thereof were a forty pound note of hand, a penknife and a comb; next day we three were apprehended on &s;u&s;picion of &s;etting the hou&s;e on fire, but were acquitted; then I &s;et off alone to Kennebunk, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, ea&s;tward of Port&s;mouth, and there broke open a &s;tore belonging to Me&s;&s;rs. Condy and Clark, and &s;tole a large quantity of dry goods and e&s;caped about 70 miles, and then was apprehended, in con&s;equence of an adver|ti&s;ement, and committed to Old-York gaol, from whence after three weeks I broke out and &s;et off for Port&s;mouth. The next night after my arrival at Port&s;mouth, I broke open the hou&s;e of Mr. Chadwick, the gaoler, and &s;tole &s;ome money and a quantity of mens and womens clothes, and gave Tre&s;&s;on (whom I found here in pri&s;on) part of the money and two &s;aws, and then &s;et off towards Newbury-Port: Next morning Tre&s;&s;on called the gaol|keeper and told him that it was I that robbed him, and had given him two &s;aws and a dollar in money, wherewith to effect his e&s;cape; then the gaoler &s;ent a pur&s;uer after me, who appre|hended and carried me back to Port&s;mouth gaol, from thence I was carried to Exeter for my trial; upon Tre&s;&s;on's evidence I was found guilty, but received no puni&s;hment by rea&s;on that I promi&s;ed to inform of all tho&s;e per&s;ons who received &s;tolen goods, and how the hou&s;e was &s;et on fire; and therefore the court ad|journed one month, and I carried back to Port&s;mouth gaol; but before the month was expired I broke gaol and &s;et off for Bo&s;ton, and fell in company with Jo&s;eph Kelly who had two coats and jackets he had &s;tolen to bear our expences to Newport. We &s;et off for Newport, and immediately upon our arrival, Kelly &s;tole a pair of &s;ilver buckles from Mr.&mdash;a Jew, and I &s;tole three or four black &s;ilk handkerchiefs from Mr. Wickham; next I and Kelly broke open a cooper's &s;hop to get tools to break into Mr. Wickham's &s;tore, but daylight coming on we could not complete our bu&s;ine&s;s. No body pointed out the &s;tore to us I had been in it the day before. Then leaving Newport, Kelly and I went to Mansfield, and there we parted; there I broke open a &s;tore belonging to Mr. Gilbert, and took a quantity of goods, to the value of about twenty pounds, and with the&s;e goods &s;et off to Voluntown to one Mr. Stedman's a receiver of &s;tolen goods; there I again met with Kelly, and getting &s;ome money of Stedman for &s;ome of the goods, I returned to Provi|dence, where I got playing cards with a countryman, cheated

At Voluntown we &s;tayed one day, and the next &s;ell in company with James Williams, who told me he was going to Providence to get on board Mr. Brown's Indiaman: I a&s;ked him to go with me the way of Ston|ington, and he con&s;ented; &s;o Williams, Kelly and I &s;et off to William Stanton's (we turned Kelly off telling him that two might keep a &s;ecret, but three could not) then Williams, Stanton and I &s;et off for Hopkinton with an intention to break a &s;tore, but did not &s;ucceed; but Williams and Stanton took a dozen pair of &s;tockings off a fence.&mdash;Upon our return to Stanton's, I held the hor&s;es at the bridge, Williams and Stanton broke open a mill, and took all the meal and corn they could find, and we carried it to Stanton's hou&s;e: Stanton next day &s;ent &s;ome of the corn to Row&s;e Babcock's for rum. Next night Stanton, Williams and I &s;et off to break into Jo&s;eph Potter's &s;tore; I broke open a mill and took a crow-bar out of it, and went to the door and broke it, and we all three went in, I fir&s;t, and they following. Being mo&s;t forward in this bu&s;ine&s;s, I lighted a candle and handed down the goods, about &s;even hundred dollars worth, and &s;ome money, two or three dollars, and carried them to Stanton's hou&s;e, where we divided them into three parts and ca&s;t lots. Williams and I took our &s;hares; after giving Stanton out of my &s;hare eight or nine pounds worth of goods for a mare, and hiding the goods under two corn &s;tacks and under a barn, about five miles from Stanton's hou&s;e, we &s;et off for Voluntown, there were appre|hended, and brought back to Hopkinton, where Stanton, I and my wife were tried for breaking open the miil; Stanton's wife and Williams were admitted as State's evidence: accordingly I was &s;entenced to receive 20 la&s;hes and my wife 10 (though &s;he was innocent).&mdash;I paid the fine by giving up part of my clothes, then committed to Newport gaol, and tried for breaking Potter's &s;hop, found guilty, and received the &s;entence of death&mdash;And the Lord have mercy upon me.</P>
<P><HI>To the above Confe&s;&s;ion I here add my la&s;t Speech and Dying Words:</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<PB N="15" REF="046227_0015_1020FE0FF38A4660">
<HEAD>The <HI>LAST SPEECH</HI> and <HI>DYING WORDS</HI> of <HI>THOMAS MOUNT,</HI> publi&s;hed at his own De&s;ire, for the public Good in general, and for that of his Comrades in particular.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I &s;ee that every attempt to break gaol is un&s;ucce&s;sful and every effort to prevent my &s;uffering an ignominious death, is like to be fruitle&s;s, I Thomas Mount, in conformity to the cu&s;tom of publi&s;hing a la&s;t &s;peech or dying words, for the benefit of my &s;urvivors, do hereby declare this to be my <HI>la&s;t &s;peech and dying words.</HI></P>
<P>And fir&s;t&mdash;I pray that the Lord may have mercy upon me, and that all good people may pity and pray for me; and that my &s;hameful end may deter others from tho&s;e actions which have brought me to this dreadful hour.</P>
<P>Secondly&mdash;I de&s;ire to be truly penitent for my crimes, both again&s;t the law of GOD and the laws of MEN; and to believe that Divine goodne&s;s hath thus arre&s;ted me in my career of wickedne&s;s, for his glory and my everla&s;ting good. I de&s;ire to be more re|&s;igned to my &s;entence than I fear I am. So great has been my propen&s;ity to &s;tealing, even from my childhood, that were my days prolonged, 'tis more than probable I &s;hould get into my old way again. I am horribly afraid to die; and yet confe&s;s I de&s;erve not to live: but am certain, that the mercy of government in par|doning thieves, is no mercy at all to them, for every pardon they get hardens them &s;o much the more in their villainy. The only way to reclaim <HI>one</HI> thief, is either to bani&s;h or hang all the <HI>other thieves</HI> and all the <HI>receivers</HI> of &s;tolen goods; for &s;o long as there are <HI>receivers</HI> and <HI>thieves</HI> living and at liberty, however penitent <HI>one thief</HI> may be the hour he receives his pardon and freedom yet whenever he gets abroad among his old acquaintances, they will wi&s;h him joy of his e&s;cape from the gallows; they will get drunk with him; they will carry him to the places of rendezvous, where the women and liquors are all in common, and with rela|ting their wonderful e&s;capes from ju&s;tice, with the &s;timulating &s;ongs of his comrades, with the artful behaviour of the &s;candals of their &s;ex, he becomes ten-fold more a child of the devil than he was before.</P>
<P>Thirdly&mdash;Nothing corrupts young fellows more, than idlene&s;s and bad women, who are fir&s;t the &s;educers to all evil, and if their extravagancies are not gratified to the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, become our betrayers: and therefore, as a dying man, would intreat all young men to get married and &s;ettled at &s;ome hone&s;t oalling as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="046227_0016_1020FE13891EFDD0">Fourthly&mdash;At my de&s;ire, the language and &s;ongs of the Ameri|can fla&s;h company are publi&s;hed, to inform the world at large how wicked that company is, and how nece&s;&s;ary it is to root them up like &s;o many thorns and briers which if &s;uffered to remain would de&s;troy the ri&s;ing crop of young fellows throughout the Continent. The whole of the &s;ecrets concerning this bu&s;ine&s;s, the names of the per&s;ons concerned in carrying it on, whether as thieves or receivers, or &s;etters on, or &s;uppliers with tools where|with to break out of gaols, or into hou&s;es, to a good friend of mine when under &s;entence of death, I have communicated; at the &s;ame time taking his promi&s;e that he will tran&s;mit the &s;ame to the Governors of the United States of America immediately after my decea&s;e, that they may be of general utility to this country.</P>
<P>Fifthly&mdash;I have communicated likewi&s;e to this gentleman, the various ways of di&s;covering thieves and hou&s;e-breakers, &s;o that in future it will be next to impo&s;&s;ible to practi&s;e the thieving bu|&s;ine&s;s without detection: And as all thieves are great cowards (for the bark of a dog will make them run) I will advi&s;e every hone&s;t man who wi&s;hes to pre&s;erve his property, to remenber the rules I have communicated, and to act upon them; if he does, there is no great chance of being robbed, or having his hou&s;e broke. Likewi&s;e I would &s;ubmit it to the judgment of our rulers, whether it would not be proper to fine every man who was rob|bed on the high-way, provided only two thieves attacked him, becau&s;e he did not defend him&s;elf; for the heroi&s;m of <HI>one</HI> hone&s;t man is, or ought to be, &s;ufficient to make <HI>two</HI> thieves run.</P>
<P>Sixthly&mdash;As a dying man, a debtor to my country, and de&s;ir|ous of making all the compen&s;ation in my power, I further make known how any man of the lea&s;t common &s;en&s;e may di&s;cover a thief,&mdash;by his often looking back&mdash;turning quick up lanes&mdash; &s;tanding to gaze at &s;igns&mdash;and &s;topping to enquire for the hou&s;es of per&s;ons who do not live in the place&mdash;going into &s;hops and giving the merchant a deal of unnece&s;&s;ary trouble in calling for a &s;ight of one thing and another, and of twenty more, without buying one article. If a thief appears in the day time, you ne|ver &s;ee him without his rogue's face on; look at him pretty &s;harply, and you will &s;ee how &s;u&s;picious and timorous he looks; take him by the hand, it feels &s;oft, and your touch makes him &s;hrink, you may perceive his hand nervous; but in nothing is this nervou&s;ne&s;s more perceptible than, if he takes a pen at your de&s;ire, to write with&mdash;it will therefore be to a&s;k all &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons to write, and their hand will in&s;tantly tell upon their heart.</P>
<P>Seventhly&mdash;I mu&s;t complain to the public of the receivers, or fences, as we call them in the fla&s;h language,&mdash;they are our &s;et|ters
<PB N="17" REF="046227_0017_1020FE15A2CABD00">
on, and they cheat us confoundedly; we &s;eldom receive from them more than a tenth part of the value, and mu&s;t take it in what pay they plea&s;e, and when they plea&s;e; and by getting us drunk with our whores, every now and then, they generally &s;teal from us all they can po&s;&s;ibly come at, and then &s;et us a fighting with one another about the goods they had taken. The&s;e receivers being in league with our whores, make them very extravagant in their demands upon us, who, after treating them with the be&s;t of our &s;poils, if we do not promi&s;e quickly to get them more, threat|en to inform again&s;t us.&mdash;In one word, a thief or highway-man is a pitiable animal; he ri&s;ks his life every adventure he engages in, and all the recompence he gets for his pains, is the treachery of his whores and comrades, and la&s;t of all an ignominious death. Though at any time we take a large quantity of goods, we can|not &s;ell them to any account; and after giving hu&s;h-money to &s;ome, paying a comrade for his help (for we hire one another on &s;uch like expeditions, as breaking a &s;hop or hou&s;e, or way-laying the &s;tage-coach, &amp;c.) and gratifying our pretended friends with pre&s;ents, we have &s;eldom or never enough to buy decent cloaths, wherein to a&s;&s;ume the character and appearance of hone&s;t men and quit bad company, had we ever &s;o much mind for it.</P>
<P>Eighth&mdash;When I look back upon a company of thieves, with their whores, met after &s;ome hou&s;e or &s;hop breaking match, full of plunder, and recollect the &s;cenes of cur&s;ing, &s;inging, dancing, &s;wearing, roaring, lewdne&s;s, drunkenne&s;s, and every po&s;&s;ible &s;ort of bruti&s;h behaviour, I dete&s;t my&s;elf for having &s;o often been one in &s;uch companies.&mdash;Under the&s;e circum&s;tances we are very liable to be apprehended: and therefore, good people and bad people, thieves and hone&s;t men, take warning by my fate, and mind my advice; for if ye get into the way of thieving, nothing can cure you but the gallows &mdash;I never heard of a thief that was re|claimed but one, and that under &s;uch circum&s;tances as can never be the lot of any other thief to the end of the world.</P>
<P>Pray for me good people&mdash;I am wicked, and there are many others in the United States perhaps as wicked as my&s;elf; I pray they may depart from their wickedne&s;s, before their cup of ini|quity becomes full, and they entail upon them&s;elves the death I am going to &s;uffer. It is but ju&s;tice that &s;uch as have lived like wolves and bea&s;ts of prey, &s;hould die like dogs, and not like men.</P>
<P>And the Lord have mercy upon me&mdash;farewel.</P>
