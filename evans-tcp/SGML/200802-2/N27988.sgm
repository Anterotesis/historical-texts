<HEAD>THE FARMER OF NEW-JERSEY; OR, A Picture of Domestic Life.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<P>AFTER a youth &s;pent in contributing to e&s;tabli&s;h the Independence of my country, I retired with my family to a little farm in New-Jer&s;ey, that had de&s;cended to me from my fore-fathers. It was a plea&s;ant &s;pot of twenty-five acres, &s;ituated on the Hud&s;on, and having a range of &s;alt meadows behind, on which I fed my cattle.</P>
<P>My wife was a thrifty, notable woman, who baked her own bread, and was &s;o often in the kitchen, that it might be &s;aid, &s;he cooked her own dinner; but, otherwi&s;e, much the lady,
<PB N="6" REF="037294_0005_100CACF155822E08">
without having had the originality of her char|acter &s;moothed into in&s;ipidity by modern refine|ment. If &s;he had any failing, it was a head-&s;trong attachment to the French Nation and its government. Deborah was a politician, and in her wi&s;dom declared that America would never flouri&s;h till &s;he entered into a treaty offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive with France.</P>
<P>My children were healthy, comely and dutiful. Of my two daughters&mdash;Eliza, now &s;eventeen, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every beauty and elegance of form, while Serena, about two years younger, was obviou&s;ly ri&s;ing into &s;ymmetry and grace.</P>
<P>In their tempers, Eliza was lofty and often impetuous; Serena of a mild and placid equabili|ty. Eliza could not re&s;train the emotions of pa&s;&s;ion; Serena repre&s;&s;ed them with a tear. Both were formed for tenderne&s;s, and loved one another &s;incerely.</P>
<P>My &s;on, a promi&s;ing lad, was ingenuous to a fault. If not di&s;tingui&s;hed by the brilliancy of his talents or attainments, he was eminent for
<PB REF="037294_0006_100CAD24F0D25638">
the warmth and &s;ympathy of his heart; and my ambition was not to behold him a great but vir|tuous character in life. Yet his mind was &s;u&s;|ceptible of literary culture. He carried his dinner with him to &s;chool before he was breech|ed, and took delight in di&s;puting with his &s;i&s;ters on the intricacies of the Engli&s;h Grammar.</P>
<P>My olde&s;t neighbours, were Par&s;on Bartho|lomew, and Farmer Hay&s;tack. The Par&s;on was a worthy man, who enjoyed the reputation of rearing the be&s;t pork in the pari&s;h. It was rumoured, but I know not with what truth, that he took le&s;s care of his flock than his &s;wine, but I think it is a ju&s;tice I owe his me|mory to affirm that, when his pigs did not em|ploy his mind, he made an excellent Sermon.</P>
<P>Farmer Hay&s;tack and his family were good, &s;leek headed folks who &s;lept well of nights. No cares di&s;turbed the old man's &s;en&s;ibility, but a &s;hower of rain when his hay was making, or &s;ome quadruped breaking through his fence.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="037294_0007_100CACF373DA0C40">
As he lived within a &s;tone's-throw of our hou&s;e, we nece&s;&s;arily became acquainted, and the &s;tate of the weather, the price of hor&s;e-fle&s;h, together with the health of the village, and the changing of its &s;choolma&s;ter, furni&s;hed my gue&s;t with a &s;ource of inexhau&s;tible conver&s;ation. <Q>This new &s;choolma&s;ter, he would &s;ay, makes a dozen that we have had &s;ince la&s;t Michael|mas was two years. I would &s;end my little boy Jack to him when he gets out of his coats, for I hear for certain &s;ure he is a man of <HI>larning.</HI> But it hurts a boy's <HI>genus</HI> to have &s;o many ma&s;ters, and Bill has now almo&s;t got through his letters.</Q></P>
<P>Such was the tenor of Farmer Hay&s;tack's di&s;cour&s;e, and his elde&s;t &s;on was &s;carcely &s;upe|rior in attainments to his father. Yet as he was a loquacious kind of fellow, and would fight any man that &s;poke di&s;re&s;pectfully of the French government; my wife was not only blind to his defects, but admitted his addre&s;&s;es to the &s;oft and &s;en&s;ible Serena. For my part, I could never li&s;ten with any temper to the in|unity
<PB N="9" REF="037294_0008_100CAD27379DF5F8">
of his di&s;cour&s;e, or behold, without di&s;gu&s;t the di&s;torted mu&s;cles of his vulgar countenance; but I was awed into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by Dorothy, who, when politics came uppermo&s;t in her mind, was like one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>As Farmer Hay&s;tack was &s;carcely rational, and Par&s;on Bartholomew ever delighting his fancy with vi&s;ions of &s;pare-ribs and hind-quar|ters, I &s;hould have been badly off for neigh|bours, had not Colonel Brandywine, the friend and fellow &s;oldier of my youth, come to &s;ettle with his family on a neck of land near my dwel|ling.</P>
<P>My daughters congratulated them&s;elves on this event, as it brought them a polite acquaint|ance in the two Mi&s;s Brandywines, who with their mother, and a brother at &s;ea, con&s;tituted the family of the Colonel.</P>
<P>The young ladies had vi&s;ited the Southern States, and re&s;ided &s;ome years at Philadelphia; but notwith&s;tanding the&s;e advantages, I could not di&s;cern that they were &s;uperior in know|ledge

to my daughters, who, though they had received only a dome&s;tic education, were well acquainted with hi&s;tory and geography, and had read the be&s;t Engli&s;h poets. Nay, Eliza was, or affected to be, enamoured of poetry, and had gone through the Iliad, with part of the Ody&s;&s;ey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>MY old friend and neighbour Colonel Brandywine, kept his Chri&s;tmas with his wife and daughters at my hou&s;e. It was evening&mdash;We had drawn round a &s;parkling fire of turf, and were amu&s;ing our&s;elves with a hundred in|nocent pa&s;times, when my wife propo&s;ed we &s;hould tell &s;tories, and my &s;on Harry was unani|mou&s;ly called upon to begin. Why, then, &s;aid Harry, I will tell you a &s;tory about Pocahuntas, an Indian queen. Bravo! cried the colonel, lighting his pipe a &s;econd time,&mdash;the &s;tory, I gue&s;s of a &s;quaw. No colonel, &s;aid the boy, an Indian queen I a&s;&s;ure you.&mdash;Once upon a time
<PB N="11" REF="037294_0010_100CAD28C2668850">
there was a captain Smith traded to Virginia, and bartered his goods with the Indians. He had learnt their language, and was often an um|pire in the quarrels between them and the whites. He was, however, once betrayed into an ambu&s;|cade of ho&s;tile Indians, and carried in triumph to Powhatan, their king. The king was &s;o proud of having captain Smith in his power, that he &s;ummoned the tributary princes to attend his triumph. At length the pri&s;oner was brought to the &s;lake, and wood prepared to burn him.&mdash;But ju&s;t as the fire was kindled, Pocahuntas, the younge&s;t and darling daughter of the king, threw her arms around the pri&s;oner, and declared, that unle&s;s he was pardoned &s;he would be burnt with him. The tears of innocence will prevail when the voice of humanity is unheard. Pow|hatan could not resi&s;t the tears and entreaties of his child. His &s;avage brea&s;t relented, and he revoked the &s;entence of captain Smith.</P>
<P>Bravi&s;&s;imo! cried colonel Brandywine. Here is a health to the de&s;cendants of the tender Po|cahuntas.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037294_0011_100CACF746A6AEB8">
The boy had &s;carcely fini&s;hed his &s;tory, and received the thanks of the company, when our dog was heard to bark, and pre&s;ently a voice to exclaim, Why, holloa here! you give your dog too great a &s;cope of cable. There's no coming within hail of the hou&s;e. Whoa, hoa, hoa! heave out there, heave out!</P>
<P>My &s;on's voice, cried the colonel, as I am a living being! William! William, repeated Mrs. Brandywine and her daughters, with emotions of plea&s;ure and &s;urpri&s;e; nor were the words ut|tered when a youth of nineteen, clad in a jacket and trow&s;ers, and having a &s;tick over his &s;houl|der with a bundle depending from it, &s;tood at the door. His mother received him in her arms, his &s;i&s;ters wept for joy, and the old man &s;eizing his &s;on's hand, &s;aid, William, dear boy, thou art welcome home.</P>
<P>A good joke father, faith, to welcome me home in another per&s;on's hou&s;e. It was with much difficulty I found out your cottage, and when I got to it, there was nobody within but an old
<PB N="13" REF="037294_0012_100CAD2AE0746150">
negro woman, &s;inging the Virginia jig, and two children dancing to the tune. But old Sue &s;oon knew me and directed me hither.</P>
<P>And ble&s;&s;ed, William, be thy coming. But why this humble dre&s;s, and wherefore this bun|dle? Yes, reiterated Mi&s;s Brandywine, how comes it, Billy, that you who were formerly as &s;pruce as sir Simon Snuff-box, &s;hould now be de|graded to the dre&s;s of a tarpaulin.</P>
<P>Why, Nancy, you &s;hall hear. From a ca&s;t-away &s;ailor you cannot rea&s;onably expect much elegance of dre&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P>Ca&s;t away!</P>
<P>Yes, a&s;&s;uredly, ca&s;t away&mdash;but before I trou|ble you with a detail of my adventures, let me de&s;ire you to introduce me to this gentleman and his family.</P>
<P>I will do that my&s;elf, &s;aid the colonel. This gentleman is Mr. Chee&s;eman, my mo&s;t particu|lar friend&mdash;That lady is his wife, and the&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="037294_0013_100CACFA10174340">
young women are his daughters. Chee&s;eman, let us celebrate my &s;on's coming with a military bowl of punch&mdash;let us draw our chairs round the fire, and, William, let us have the faithful recital of your adventures. But I &s;ay, my cun|ning traveller, let there be no hyperboles, no embelli&s;hments of your own, no mountains of &s;ugar and rivers of rum: you have not been twice round the Cape of Good Hope for no|thing. Come, my boy, begin your travel's hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>William now drew his chair towards the fire, and bowing to my wife and daughters, began his narration as follows:</P>
<P>In our outward bound pa&s;&s;age from Philadel|phia to Joanna, we had much boi&s;terous wea|ther, and the horrors of every gale were aggra|vated by the timidity of our captain. He was an original being in per&s;on and mind. He was &s;o exce&s;&s;ively &s;at that Jack Haulyard, our &s;econd mate, u&s;ed to &s;ay the &s;hip would never be in trim if he &s;taid &s;o much abaft, for the old
<PB N="15" REF="037294_0014_100CAD2D9ACE55D0">
fellow was continually in his cabin. We how|ever got &s;afe to the coa&s;t Malabar; but ju&s;t as we came within &s;ight of the high land of Chaul, our &s;hip fell in with five &s;ail of Angria's Pirates, a &s;now, a ketch, and a &s;chooner. It was night&mdash;the moon was ri&s;ing over the &s;hore. 'Twould be difficult to de&s;cribe the con&s;terna|tion of our captain. Mr. Brandywine, &s;aid he, do you &s;ee tho&s;e bloody pirates? What &s;hall we do? Fight them &s;ir, &s;aid I. No! No! Mr. Brandywine, rejoined the captain, let us make all the &s;ail we can; there is no occa&s;ion to fight when we have in our power to run.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al was executed. We <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> up the helm, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ouded every &s;titch of canva&s;s to the breeze. But the pirates, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their oars, came up with us, hand over hand, and we had no alternative left but that of engaging them. Our captain however was of a different opinion. When he &s;aw the point a gun at the headmo&s;t ve&s;&s;el, he tremblingly exclaimed, Mr. Brandywine, Mr. Brandywine, I entreat you not to fire, or perhaps they will return <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="16" REF="037294_0015_100CACFC369FD748">
do us a mi&s;chief. I an&s;wered this magnanimous hero as he de&s;erved, by knocking him down on the deck, and took the command of the &s;hip into my own hands. I furled my top-gallant &s;ails, hauled up the fore&s;ail, and hove my main|yard aback, to wait for the pirates. But they thought better of it, and after exchanging a few &s;hot, hauled up to the we&s;tward. I now gave the &s;hip back to the Captain, who during the action had put his head into a tar-barrel, and the next morning we came to an anchor in Bombay harbour. Here the Captain, by his artful repre&s;entation of my conduct, procured me, not a crown of laurel, but a di&s;mi&s;&s;al from the &s;hip. I was paid my wages, bound over to give &s;ecurity for my good conduct, and &s;evere|ly reprimanded by the American Agent. But I told them both to go to the devil, and as long as my money la&s;ted, lived like a Nabob&punc; I hired a Palamquin, kept my Bibee and Huck|abadar, and when the &s;tanding part of my la&s;t guinea was gone, entered my&s;elf mate of a &s;mall &s;hip that was bound to Philadephia. We
<PB N="17" REF="037294_0016_100CAD2FC0DDAE00">
coa&s;ted it to Cape Comorin, and then made the be&s;t of our pa&s;&s;age homewards. But I &s;oon found I belonged to a ve&s;&s;el, that I ought not to have tru&s;ted my old &s;hoes on board of. She appeared to be fitted out by the pari&s;h. There was not a rope on board &s;trong enough to hang a cat with&mdash;I never &s;aw &s;uch a mi&s;erable tub. Yet, our Captain, loved her more than his wife, calling her his dear Virginia.</P>
<P>As we approached the American coa&s;t, a &s;trong gale blew us upon the Jer&s;eys, and it was not till the night, that we found our&s;elves up|on a lee-&s;hore. About three in the morning, our &s;hip &s;truck, and as our boat was &s;tove, there was no way to &s;ave our&s;elves, but by &s;wim|ming. The Captain was a good &s;wimmer; but the whole time he was in the water, he did nothing but exclaim, My poor, dear Virginia! He reached the &s;hore in &s;afety, but like ano|ther Orpheus, looking round at his Eurydice' a huge wave &s;truck him in the brea&s;t, and near|ly ca&s;t off his life-lines. Three &s;eamen and a boy were drowned, but the re&s;t of the crew e&s;|caped
<PB N="18" REF="037294_0017_100CACFDC0A02800">
by &s;wimming. As to the Captain, I left him in bed at a Cottage, where he lay raving mad, calling out to tho&s;e around him, to re&s;tore him his Virginia. For my part, I made the be&s;t of my way homeward, and now forget my &s;ufferings in the joy of beholding my fa|mily.</P>
<P>We all li&s;tened with much attention to the recital of William, who &s;at between his &s;i&s;ters, holding a hand of each in his own. His coun|tenance was animated, and his per&s;on, though disfigured by the uncouthne&s;s of his dre&s;s, graceful and manly.</P>
<P>My chief regret in being wrecked, re&s;umed William, was the lo&s;ing half a dozen Camel-hair &s;hawls, which I had de&s;igned as pre&s;ents for my family and friends.</P>
<P>A fig for the &s;hawls, &s;aid Mrs. Brandywine, we have got you, and can di&s;pen&s;e with every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>As the young &s;ailor had undergone much fa|tigue, we had an early &s;upper, and I will ven|ture
<PB N="19" REF="037294_0018_100CAD3147C0D918">
to affirm, that a &s;weeter meal was never eaten &s;ince New-Jer&s;ey had been colonized. Good humour without coar&s;ene&s;s, pre&s;ided at our board, and every countenance reflected an hilarity of heart. As to the Colonel, he could not re&s;train his joy, and an uncon&s;cious &s;igh &s;tole from the bo&s;oms of my daughters, while William related his &s;ufferings. After offering a prayer to the Omnipotent for his mercies, the Colonel with his children withdrew to their hou&s;e, and our own family to re&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning William called at our hou&s;e, and politely hoped my wife and daugh|ters felt no indi&s;po&s;ition from &s;itting up &s;o late to hear his &s;tory. His appearance was much improved by a change of dre&s;s, and I do not re|member to have &s;een a hand&s;omer or better bred youth. 'Tis true that he &s;ometimes affected the phra&s;eology of a &s;eaman, but his conver&s;ation
<PB N="20" REF="037294_0019_100CACFFDC0487F8">
otherwi&s;e was not without elegance, and I found him conver&s;ant with the branches of polite eru|dition. He had been educated at Columbia College, and was de&s;igned for the gown, but from &s;ome caprice had di&s;obeyed the wi&s;hes of his father, to embark for the Indies, whither he had been three voyages.</P>
<P>He found me &s;itting with my &s;on and daugh|ters at their &s;tudies. Serena was &s;tudying Geo|graphy, and in the innocence of her heart in|treated William to &s;hew her the places he had vi&s;ited on the map. I am peculiarly fond of Geography, &s;aid Serena; but I never behold a map without reflecting that the countries before me may contain di&s;po&s;itions I &s;hould like to be acquainted with, and &s;ighing that this will never be in my power. A beautiful &s;entiment, &s;aid William, and to gratify it you had better go a voyage with me; the ocean would be &s;oothed into a calm at the &s;miles of Serena. Then, in|deed, rejoined Serena, you a&s;cribe to me more than moral power. And more than <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="21" REF="037294_0020_100CAD336218B2E0">
you are, &s;aid William; but go on my fair pupil with your &s;tudies, and, in the mean time, I will addre&s;s you with a little poem on the &s;ubject. Serena &s;miled, and William &s;natching up a pen, wrote ha&s;tily as follows&mdash;his eye, the whole time, in a fine phrenzy rolling:</P>

<P>Serena was much flattered by this poetical ef|fu&s;ion, which called a blu&s;h into her cheek; nor could I refu&s;e it my prai&s;e. Eliza declared it was the &s;weete&s;t thing &s;he had ever read, and my wife prote&s;ted it de&s;erved to be publi&s;hed in the New-York Magazine. William could not refrain from &s;miling at the la&s;t compliment, which, however, was &s;aid with too grave a face to be ironical.</P>
<P>Upon my word, Sir, &s;aid my &s;on, one would &s;uppo&s;e that you had come from the &s;hade of a|cademic bowers, rather than the lap of Thetis. You po&s;&s;e&s;s what falls to the lot of few, felicity in writing an Ode&mdash;which, in my opinion, cannot be

had from purcha&s;e, but gift&mdash;and a gift <HI>per &s;e.</HI> Why, Sir, rejoined William, it is found that the efforts of the heart will always &s;ucceed beyond tho&s;e of fiction, aswe can always feel more than we can imagine. To &s;ay that I derived a &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure from &s;tudying the maps with your &s;i&s;ter, will be readily believed; and my ode on the &s;ubject is not a cold production of the head, but a warm effu&s;ion from the heart.</P>
<P>A happy method, &s;aid Henry, of di&s;gui&s;ing the pa&s;&s;ion of love in the language of philo&s;ophy. I have heard Fanny often &s;ay &s;he &s;hould like a poet for her hu&s;band, but I never yet knew that Serena was a votary of Apollo.</P>
<P>Fanny &s;miled triumphantly, but Serena, with more than u&s;ual emotion, re&s;orted, You will do well, brother, to keep your opinions to your&s;elf, and not pretend to determine that I have no re|li&s;h for poetry. I am &s;ure I could read Gold|&s;mith's Edwin and Angelina for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="037294_0023_100CAD04B1780448">
What elegant language, cried Henry, <HI>keep your opinions to your&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>And no fault that I know of, cried William, can be found with it. A &s;ource of plea&s;ure is derived from the idioms of every language, to de&s;troy which would be to take away its great|e&s;t charm. Simplicity in conver&s;ation is to me its mo&s;t captivating beauty, and, therefore, in my judgment, the ladies of New-Jer&s;ey talk better than tho&s;e of New-York. As to Mi&s;s Serena's ta&s;te for poetry, there cannot be a more convincing proof of it than her fondne&s;s for the ballad of Edwin and Angelina; and Gold&s;mith, while &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her approbation of it, might have &s;een his apotheo&s;is in her eyes.</P>
<P>I know not whether Serena comprehended this elegance of adulation in its <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> force, but the mention of her eyes was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> by her into a compliment, and &s;he held <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> down with ba&s;hful lovline&s;s.

<P><PB N="25" REF="037294_0024_100CAD3840AE9368">
When they were gone, my wife took off her &s;pectacles, and looking round at me triumphant|ly, called out, A conque&s;t! Eliza, I plainly &s;ee has won the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the young &s;ailor.</P>
<P>Mama, an&s;wered Eliza, poutingly, &s;ay rather Serena. I am &s;ure all his compliments were lavi&s;hed upon her.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE following afternoon my &s;on returned in a chair with William Brandywine, accompanied by a gentleman of about thirty, very fa&s;hionably dre&s;&s;ed and hand&s;omely mounted. They had called at my hou&s;e, but finding the family gone to vi&s;it the colonel, they followed our foot-&s;teps. The girls ran to the window at their approach, and in a few minutes. William en|tered with my &s;on and the &s;tranger. Give me leave, ladies, &s;aid he, to introduce Doctor Lo|vell to your acquaintance. He is one of my
<PB N="27" REF="037294_0026_100CAD3A5EDF61A0">
particular friends, who once was &s;urgeon to a &s;hip of which I was an officer. The doctor was an excellent &s;eaman below in a gale of wind.</P>
<P>The doctor bowed, and &s;oon by his ea&s;y, un|affected manners, made him&s;elf agreeable to us all. His per&s;on was dignified, and his manners perfectly tho&s;e of a man of the world.</P>
<P>Your &s;on, Mr. Chee&s;eman, cried William, would, I am per&s;uaded, make a fortune in &s;pe|culations upon hor&s;e-fle&s;h. The mo&s;t expert jockey that ever nicked a hor&s;e would never be able to lay an anchor out to windward of him. What do you think, doctor, of that hor&s;e of mine? Why, I think, an&s;wered the doctor that he will run away with you. To appropriate your own language, he ju&s;t now nearly pitched you over his bows.</P>
<P>P&s;haw, cried William, the be&s;t &s;eaman in the world cannot hinder his &s;hip from pitching or rolling; and it is a bad navigation from the Kilm<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">s to this hou&s;e. At one time, I thought my&s;elf in the &s;traits of Ba&s;&s;leman. But now I

think of it, young Ladies, I have &s;ome plea|&s;ant news to impart&mdash;</P>
<P>Oh, hang your news, &s;aid Mi&s;s Brandywine; Ladies are not politicians. They never read the papers, but for the deaths or marriages.</P>
<P>It is neither, replied William, about politics, weddings or burials&mdash;Coming along, we o|vertook an old blind negro, with a fiddle under his arm, led by a little boy. Old fellow, &s;aid I, can you play a country dance? Yes Mo&s;&s;er, an&s;wered the old boy, a dozen of them, and immediately &s;truck up the White Cockade. Then you are the very man I want, &s;aid I, and propo&s;ed to him to take a &s;eat in the chair. But the negro, though he could not &s;ee me, &s;aid I was too great a gentleman for him to ride with, and offered to call at my hou&s;e; &s;o I threw the boy half a dollar to give him, and enjoined him not to fail calling at Colonel Brandywine's:&mdash;We may expect him &s;oon, and, Ladies, we can form a little dance.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="037294_0028_100CAD3BE69DAA78">
The girls, at this information, appeared much rejoiced&mdash;The tea was ha&s;tened, and a tru&s;ty me&s;&s;enger di&s;patched, to bring the blind fiddler to the hou&s;e. He &s;oon after was announced, and entered, led by a negro boy, who, he told us, was his grand&s;on. I remarked that the old man reeled a little in walking, but this I a&s;|cribed to his blindne&s;s; and the young people, cleared the parlour for a dance.</P>
<P>When the chairs and tables were removed, William led up the dance with my younge&s;t daughter Serena, who, though &s;he had never received but three le&s;&s;ons from an itinerant dancing ma&s;ter, exceeded both the Mi&s;s Bran|dywines, in the unaffected ea&s;e of her carriage, and the graceful negligence of her &s;teps. My other child was taken out by Doctor Lovell, and my Son compo&s;ed the third couple, with the elde&s;t daughter of the Colonel: of the young Ladies her &s;i&s;ter alone, was without a partner, and, to make up the deficiency, I took her hand my&s;elf. It is true, I was not dre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="30" REF="037294_0029_100CAD0A146B2858">
for the Ball-room, and had not &s;haken a foot at the fiddle for at lea&s;t a dozen years. But I was re&s;olved to do my be&s;t, and waited with &s;ome impatience for my turn to begin. My wife nodded her head in token of approbation, and whi&s;pered to Mrs. Brandywine, loud e|nough to be heard, that if it was not for the nails in my &s;hoes, I &s;hould dance as <HI>&s;pry</HI> as any.</P>
<P>At length the dance was called, and the old negro in a corner, began to &s;crape his cat-gut. But never was there &s;uch di&s;cord; it was the mere rubbing of his &s;tick again&s;t the bridge of his fiddle, without the lea&s;t regard to notes. It was in vain that William remon&s;trated with the blind fiddler, and told him he had played di|vinely on the road. The fellow was &s;o drunk, that he could not &s;it upright, and his face was di&s;tended with the mo&s;t frightful contor&s;ions.</P>
<P>Why, confound the fellow, cried William, he is drunk!&mdash;drunk as ten hundred top-fail &s;heet blocks; tell me little <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, the rea&s;on your Dady don't play?</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="037294_0030_100CAD3EAEE280A0">
<HI>Oh Mo&s;&s;er,</HI> cried the boy, <HI>Old Dady never play when he drink a little too much; we &s;top at half-way hou&s;e, and old Dady &s;pend Mo&s;&s;er's half dollar in rum.</HI></P>
<P>A &s;ad di&s;a&s;ter, &s;aid William, what, Ladies can we do?</P>
<P>'Oh! take the mon&s;ter away, exclaimed Mi&s;s Brandywine&mdash;I declare I am ready to faint; the man is &s;o intoxicated, he cannot &s;it.</P>
<P><HI>Never mind me, Mi&s;&s;ee,</HI> &s;aid the old fellow; <HI>Me &s;it very well</HI>&mdash;you <HI>Mi&s;&s;ee dance</HI>&mdash;<HI>why nobo|dy dance? Orpheus play his fingers off, but nobo|dy dance; there good tune Mi&s;&s;ee, old Orpheus play well for true.</HI></P>
<P>Orpheus! cried Mi&s;s Brandywine; never was the name &s;o profaned; do brother take the old wretch away.</P>
<P>But if I take him away, &s;aid William, what &s;hall we do for a fiddler? The old boy, when he gets his hand in, will, I make no doubt, play very well; however, if you all in&s;i&s;t upon

bani&s;hing him your pre&s;ence, here he goes&mdash;Yoa! hoa! up!&mdash;So &s;aying, he took the old negro fiddler by the &s;houlder, and pu&s;hed him towards the door, but not with more reluct|ance did the fir&s;t Orpheus leave the &s;hades, than this modern one the room. He re&s;i&s;ted the efforts of the young Sailor, calling out, <HI>Mi&s;&s;ee, me play well for true;</HI> while the crying of the boy, at the violence offered to his grand|father, formed a Serio-Comic &s;cene.</P>
<P>The Colonel, who had played in his youth on the violin, now propo&s;ed to take the in&s;tru|ment, rather than the dance &s;hould be &s;poiled; and we contrived to foot it away with much hilarity, notwith&s;tanding our &s;econd fiddler was little better than the fir&s;t. For my part, what I wanted in graceful agility, I made up by mu&s;cular exertion; and comforted my&s;elf with the reflection, that though I was no great dan|cer my&s;elf, I had a &s;on and two daughters in the room, who could do the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> for me.</P>

<P>THE marked attention which the Son of my friend the Colonel paid my daughter Serena, did not e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of Deborah and my&s;elf; but, one circum&s;tance interfered to make us view it with &s;orrow. The Son of farmer Hay&s;tack, from his long attention to Serena, had a claim to her hand; and, to his father, who once propo&s;ed their being joined in wedlock, I had &s;ignified my a&s;&s;ent. Serena, who was ever happy when &s;he made me &s;o, te&s;tified no re|pugnance to the match, and, as neighbour Hay|&s;tack was a violent Democrat, my wife could have no objection. As to the Lover, he was not remarkable for his accomplishments, unle&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">

My &s;ecret di&s;inclination to the marriage aro&s;e from the reflection, that he was not enlighten|ed enough to be the yoke-fellow of the tender Serena.</P>
<P>It was, however, time to determine &s;ome|thing, and, after a morning in which William had behaved to my daughter with di&s;tingui&s;hed attention, I took the opportunity in his ab&s;ence, thus, to acco&s;t her before my wife.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, Serena, not improper to re|mind you of the promi&s;e you have made young Hay&s;tack to become his partner for life. I have too favourable an opinion of you, my child, to think you can act the coquette, and encourage one man with tho&s;e &s;miles that be|long to another; therefore, the plea&s;ure you manife&s;t at the attention of William creates &s;u&s;picions in my brea&s;t, that he is not wholly indifferent to you. Tell your father candidly, Serena, did he ever avow a pa&s;&s;ion for you?</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="037294_0034_100CAD4256D5CF58">
To be candid, Papa, he has! It was only ye&s;terday William repeated, that no earthly power &s;hould hinder me from becoming his wife. It was in vain that I expo&s;tulated, and told him another had a claim to me. He &s;wore vehemently he would mount his hor&s;e, and cut his rival Hay&s;tack's throat.

<P>What? did you promi&s;e him marriage!</P>
<P>I did, Papa, indeed! for alas&mdash;I can never love, or think of another&mdash;</P>
<P>Then, cried I, with indignation, may you meet the reward of your di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s.

Begone, blockhead, rejoined William, it would be doing you too much honor to cha&s;ti&s;e you.</P>
<P>Cha&s;ti&s;e! &s;aid Hay&s;tack, that is I gue&s;s as much as to &s;ay as how you'd flog me.

My &s;on now stepped up to the Farmer, and clinching his fi&s;t addre&s;&s;ed him as follows:</P>
<P>Mr. Hay&s;tack, the hor&s;e which you are plea&s;|ed to call broken-winded was purcha&s;ed by me, and therefore this la&s;t in&s;ult I mu&s;t take to my|&s;elf. I have flogged many a better fellow than you, in my time, and I will let you &s;ee that you

<P>WHEN William was gone, my wife haranged me from her chair. It would be &s;urely folly, my dear, to interpo&s;e our authority, where our &s;anction is demanded.

<P>Chee&s;eman, cried the Colonel, this marriage between our children, will be the cement of our friend&s;hip. A &s;ly young dog! he never before told me of his pa&s;&s;ion.

On Valentine's day, you &s;hall be paired, and when your nup|tials, Bill, are con&s;ummated, I will pre&s;ent you with a &s;hip to make your fortune.

<P>The Colonel was &s;carcely gone, when the beating of a hor&s;e's hoofs was heard, and we ran to the window to &s;ee who was coming. It was Doctor Lovell, who di&s;mounting from his &s;teed, came into the hou&s;e. The u&s;ual &s;aluta|tions over, he addre&s;&s;ed William with &s;aying, Upon my word, Brandywine, thou art a hap|py fellow, for I always find you in the mid&s;t of loveline&s;s and grace. But, young Ladies, the motive of my vi&s;it is to invite you to a Batche|lor's ball, and to &s;olicit Mi&s;s Eliza, to do me the honour to become my partner. I hope

the Mu&s;icians will be better than they were at our la&s;t a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>If your Ball, &s;aid William, be a batchelor's Ball, I &s;hall haul my wind away from you&mdash;I de&s;pi&s;e heartily the whole fraternity&mdash;</P>
<P>What are you going &s;o &s;oon, then, to be married?</P>

<P>But to whom, Sir, if I may take the liber|ty?</P>

To Mi&s;s Serena! exclaimed the Doctor, re|covering from his con&s;ternation. Sir, I con|gratulate you, and Madam, I make you my re&s;pects.</P>
<P>During this conver&s;ation, I could not but remark the emotion of the Doctor, and the blu&s;hes of my elde&s;t daughter, at the confu&s;ion he bad betrayed. I began to &s;u&s;pect that Eli|za had made an impre&s;&s;ion on his affections, and would have kept her away from the Ball, had I not been over-ruled by my wife. The Doc|tor accompanied us to the Colonel, and was &s;carcely le&s;s attentive, though more refined to|wards Eliza, than William was to her &s;i&s;ter. My Son Henry, al&s;o, never quitted the &s;ide of Mi&s;s Brandywine, &s;o that the &s;cene wore the &s;emblance of innocent court&s;hip. Time &s;eemed to take another pair of wings, and the pipe of the Colonel did not once go out from &s;un&s;et till midnight.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>ON Valentine's day my daughter's nuptials were privately con&s;ummated, and only our old party celebrated the wedding. But never was there a more perfect &s;cene of &s;ublunary bli&s;s. William was almo&s;t giddy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Serena, who&s;e azure eyes never langui&s;hed with more unaffected expre&s;&s;ion. She had &s;carcely reached her &s;ixteenth year, and might have &s;at to a painter for the younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter of the Graces.</P>
<P>As William intended to embark &s;oon on a|nother voyage, he did not take a hou&s;e, but carried his bride home to his father, who pre|&s;ented her on the wedding-day with notes for five thou&s;and dollars, and promi&s;ed to William a ve&s;&s;el of three hundred tons.</P>
<P>But five months elap&s;ed, before the Colonel could find a &s;hip to his liking, when the con|firmed pregnancy of Serena made him defer
<PB N="48" REF="037294_0047_100CAD6895B192D8">
his voyage till the next year. But with the coming &s;pring, he began to make active prepa|rations for a voyage, though I believe he would willingly have procra&s;tinated his departure. Se|rena had brought him a boy&punc; and was in a fair way of producing another.</P>
<P>However at length the day arrived, when he was to proceed on his voyage, being bound up the &s;traits. The wind was favourable, and we all accompanied him to Paulus-Hook. The &s;cene was too affecting for me to pretend to de|pict it. Serena hung round her husband's neck, which &s;he bathed with her tears, then gave him the child, while &s;obs broke her utterance. Wil|liam turned him&s;elf a&s;ide, to conceal the falling tear, and the words of the Colonel faultered on his tongue, while he gra&s;ped his Son by the hand. At length he &s;tepped into the boat, holding his hands up to his face, and it was in this attitude that we viewed him recede from the &s;hore. My wife and Eliza, &s;trove to con|&s;ole

the afflicted Serena, but &s;he only an&s;wered with the exclamation of My heart forebodes me evil&mdash;Oh! God! I &s;hall never &s;ee him more!</P>
<P>In a dejected manner we proceeded home|wards, and got to my dwelling; but the de|parture of William threw a gloom on every face. Once or twice, the Colonel attempted to relate a &s;tory, but grief lopped his utter|ance, and he could not go on. Our party, therefore, &s;oon broke up, for the cup of our life was filled with the bitterne&s;s of woe. It is to no purpo&s;e the face puts on gladne&s;s, when the heart is wrong with angui&s;h.</P>

<P>WILLIAM had been gone but a few months when Doctor Lovell &s;ugge&s;ted to me the pa&s;&s;ion he cheri&s;hed for Eliza, and begged my approbation of his &s;uit.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="037294_0049_100CAD6A1F19EDE8">
As he was a man of fortune, talents, and in|exceptionable character, I could have no objec|tion to him for a Son-in-law, and I knew that he had long been acceptable to the heart of my daughter. Their marriage was celebrated with much fe&s;tivity, except that grief, like a worm in the bud, preyed on the cheek of Serena, who would not mingle in the dance. The doctor hired a &s;mall farm within a mile of our habita|tion, and, by his accommodating temper and conciliating manners, was a great acce&s;&s;ion to our &s;ociety.</P>
<P>My happine&s;s would now have been complete, but for the dejection of Serena, who&s;e cheerful|ne&s;s for&s;ook her from the moment &s;he parted with William. Her only con&s;olation was in her boy, who reflected the image of his father, and a little girl at her brea&s;t.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of affairs, the father of doctor Lovell, who was one of the greate&s;t planters in Georgia, died &s;uddenly inte&s;tate, and every po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion de&s;cended to his &s;on&punc; The Doctor well

knew the extent of his plantations, and con&s;ci|ous that he &s;hould never be enabled to &s;uperin|tend the whole, offered to loan part at an ea&s;y price to the Colonel and my&s;elf. It would be a great pity, &s;aid he, were our three families to &s;eparate. Acquie&s;ce, therefore, in my propo&s;al. In removing to Georgia, you will carry every connexion in your&s;elves. My plantations are on the Atlantic. The &s;ummer is rendered agreeable by a refre&s;hing &s;ea-breeze, and the air of the winter is remarkably &s;oft. Be&s;ides, change of climate, and external objects, may relieve the mind of Serena.</P>
<P>The Colonel and my&s;elf agreed to wait three months longer for the arrival of William, and if he did not return at that period to undertake with our families the migration. In the mean|while we found purcha&s;ers for our farms, and the chief of our cattle.</P>
<P>Nearly four months rolled on without bring|ing any tidings of William. He had now been gone nearly a year, and we had rea&s;on to expect
<PB N="52" REF="037294_0051_100CAD6BA5454668">
him in half that time. The dejection of Serena, affected us all; &s;he never told her grief, but her wan eye, and faded cheek, di&s;closed it to every beholder.</P>
<P>We therefore prepared to go. Yet it was not without exce&s;s of &s;orrow that I left the habita|tion in which I had lived &s;o long, &s;o innocently, and &s;o peaceably! My feet clung to the thre&s;h|old, and I looked with wildne&s;s at the locu&s;t tree, under who&s;e &s;hade I had &s;o often &s;at with my wife and children. Oh! if the&s;e are prejudices, let me hug them to my brea&s;t, and far away be that philo&s;ophy that would deprive me of my feelings! My wife hung down her head, and Serena bedewed with tears the child that &s;lept on her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable di&s;tingui&s;hed our journey, unle&s;s it was the proce&s;&s;ion our families made. As the Doctor had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act at Philadelphia, we proceeded thither in three carriages, and at that city embarked for Savan|nah, where we arrived in ten days.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="037294_0052_100CAD528B464AA0">
We did not &s;tay long at Savannah, but went without delay to our plantations. The level|ne&s;s of the country before us, where not the gentle&s;t acclivity ble&s;t the &s;ight, made us &s;igh for our hills to the northward; and the gloo|mine&s;s of the road, through one continued tract of pine barren, operated to encrea&s;e the melan|choly of Serena.</P>
<P>The axe of the negro felling trees was heard from the woods, and con&s;pired with the note of the whipper-will to throw a horror upon the &s;cene.</P>
<P>The &s;un went down upon our melancholy, and it was dark when we reached the plantation of my &s;on-in-law.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>WE found our &s;erenity partly re&s;tored in the morning, when I accompanied the Colonel and Doctor Lovel to take a &s;urvey of the plan|tation.
<PB N="54" REF="037294_0053_100CAD6DB9BBC518">
To form an idea of our habitations, let the reader picture to him&s;elf three hou&s;es within a quarter of a mile of each other, bounded by the Atlantic ocean on the ea&s;t, and lofty trees of pine and hickory on the we&s;t.</P>
<P>In the vicinity of our dwellings were exten|&s;ive grounds of cotton and of rice, on which at lea&s;t an hundred and &s;eventy negroes were em|ployed. My heart bled at the toils of the poor African before me, for I had laid it down as an axiom, that the property of a ma&s;ter in his &s;lave was an u&s;urpation and not a right; but I quieted my con&s;cience with the determination to &s;often the rigours of his bondage.</P>
<P>The country in the neighbourhood exhibited a new and enchanting pro&s;pect. The borders of the woods were covered with the branches of the dog-wood, who&s;e white flowers intermixed with the purple and luxuriant blo&s;&s;oms of the red-bud tree, caught the eye from every part; while &s;hrubs of jessamine, blended with the
<PB N="55" REF="037294_0054_100CAD5411A113A8">
honey-&s;uckle, lined the road on either &s;ide.&mdash;The feathered choir began to warble their &s;trains, and from every tree was heard the &s;ong of the red-bird, of which the pau&s;es were filled by the mocking-bird, who either imitated the note with the utmo&s;t preci&s;ion, or poured forth a ravi&s;hing melody of its own.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t care was to cultivate our re&s;pective fields of cotton, which, expo&s;ed to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">-breeze, was not exceeded in its &s;taple by any of the &s;tate. As we compo&s;ed three families living in the bo&s;om of the &s;ame exten&s;ive wood, we &s;ought but little acquaintance with the other planters; nor did their o&s;tentatious manners &s;uit the prim|oeval &s;implicity of our own.</P>
<P>But the ab&s;ence of William was an in&s;upe|rable ob&s;tacle to our tranquility. The only con&s;truction we could put on his not returning, was his being made pri&s;oner by the Algerines. This was the &s;ugge&s;tion of the heart of Serena, who&s;e grief vi&s;ibly augmented to the &s;orrow of
<PB N="56" REF="037294_0055_100CAD709DD803C0">
her family. We did every thing in our power to con&s;ole her, by ob&s;erving that &s;uch incidents were not rare; and the accidental peru&s;al of the Hi&s;tory of Donna Mencia in Le Sage, confirm|ed her in the probability of what we &s;ugge&s;ted. But her chief refuge was in the compo&s;ition of elegiac &s;trains, and the following effu&s;ion of her &s;orrows, though irregular, I have ever con&s;idered tender.</P>

But every condition of life has its proportion of good and evil, and if the &s;orrow of Serena afflicted, the tranquility of her &s;i&s;ter gave me rea&s;on to rejoice. She was the mother of a blooming boy, and doated on by her husband.</P>
<P>Winter came on, but no tidings of William. It was, therefore, concluded on that he was taken by the Moors, and Doctor Lovel propo&s;ed going to Philadelphia, that he might make every enquiry of his mercantile friends, and &s;hould our conjectures be right, adopt means to effect his ran&s;om.</P>

<P>It was early in the winter, when we were one evening sitting round a cheerful fire of wood, that the colonel propo&s;ed we &s;hould re&s;pectively tell a &s;tory of &s;ome diverting tendency. I will be &s;orrowful, &s;aid he, no longer. Hope bids me con&s;ole my&s;elf that William will return, and his ab&s;ence is a di&s;pen&s;ation from Heaven, at which to murmur is profane.

<P>In the mid&s;t of an awful &s;ilence that prevailed throughout our party, Serena, with di&s;traction in her looks, &s;uddenly &s;hrieked from her chair, Oh God! oh God! I hear the cries of di&s;tre&s;s! It is William! Oh God! it is William!</P>

The moon was veiled from our eyes by clouds of the deepe&s;t black, and what light &s;he afforded, &s;erved only to increa&s;e the horror of the &s;cene.</P>

Let us, there|fore, compo&s;e our minds in prayer, and bow before the throne of that God, who knows when to give, and when to take away.</P>

<P>THERE now only remained to be performed the melancholy interment of our children.&mdash;About a hundred yards from my hou&s;e were two cypre&s;s trees, forming a kind of arch, under which we propo&s;ed to bury their remains. It was on a gentle eminence that commanded a view of the ocean, and hither Serena would often repair with no other companions but her children, to indulge under their gloom in the luxury of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>As there was no Clergyman in the neighbour|hood, I undertook to read the burial &s;ervice over the grave my&s;elf, and, indeed, I thought my connexion of father made me a very proper per&s;on. The coffins were followed to the grave by our families and a few of our neighbours, whom, when I had read the &s;ervice, I addre&s;&s;ed in nearly the following words:</P>
<P>"Though my heart and eyes are yet full from the mournful &s;cene you have witne&s;&s;ed, I &s;ub|mit
<PB N="68" REF="037294_0067_100CAD7D6524FCC8">
with pious re&s;ignation to the event that deprives me of a beloved child; for in what terms could I addre&s;s that Omnipotent Being, who&s;e decrees my complaints &s;hould accu&s;e of inju&s;tice. The object of my di&s;cour&s;e is to re|mind you of the in&s;tability of worldly things, and to admoni&s;h you of the le&s;&s;on afforded us by the premature decea&s;e of tho&s;e we have ju&s;t interred. Not only every year, but every day, every hour, every moment may be our la&s;t. Meditate, therefore, over the tomb of your de|parted friends, and in the pre&s;ence of their a&s;hes, on the chance, vanity and vexation of life. What now, in the&s;e dark habitations of death, remains to them of all their plea&s;ures, endear|ments and projects of happine&s;s?</P>
<P>Clo&s;ed are tho&s;e eyes, that once &s;parkled with gaiety, and pallid the cheek that glowed with the bloom of health.</P>
<P>My &s;ufferings are great. With eyes turned to the fatal rock, my daughter complained, nor could her father con&s;ole her. I &s;tood all night

on the &s;hore.&mdash;The moon lent its beam to di&s;co|ver only &s;ights of woe, for the wave that rolled to the &s;hore, overwhelmed her husband in its rage. She ran to the &s;pot, and breathed her la&s;t upon the cor&s;e. Gone is my child, but it was God who called her away.</P>
<P>"When the &s;torm lifts the waves, I &s;hall &s;it by the &s;hore, and look on the fatal rock.&mdash;Often &s;hall I think of my child, and often drop the tear; but it will be the tear of re|&s;ignation, and not of reproach, at the great Di&s;pen&s;er of all things."</P>
<P>When I had fini&s;hed my addre&s;s, our fami|lies returned in &s;low proce&s;&s;ion to the hou&s;e, more compo&s;ed I thought in their minds from my admonition over the grave. For a con&s;i|derable time they lamented the decea&s;e of Wil|liam and Serena, but at length the memory of them gave way to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new objects, to the growth of their children, and the marriage
<PB N="70" REF="037294_0069_100CAD7F86928690">
of my &s;on with the elde&s;t daughter of the co|lonel.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of my child was a &s;evere blow to the feelings of my wife, but I &s;oothed her with my coun&s;el, and endeavoured, by my own example, to teach her patience under &s;uffering.</P>
