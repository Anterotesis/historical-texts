<HEAD>THE TWO SHOEMAKERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE tricks were &s;o merry that the time &s;eemed &s;hort, and when they were over he could not forbear going into the Globe and treating the&s;e choice &s;pirits with a bowl of punch. Ju&s;t as they were taking the la&s;t gla&s;s, Jack happened to &s;ay that he was the be&s;t fives player in the country. "That is lucky," &s;aid the Andrew, "for there is a famous match now playing in the court, and you may never have &s;uch an opportunity to &s;how your &s;kill." Brown declared he could not &s;tay, for that he had left his hor&s;e at the Star, and mu&s;t &s;et off on urgent bu&s;ine&s;s. They now all pretended to call his &s;kill in que&s;tion. This rou&s;ed his pride, and he thought another half hour could break no &s;quares. Smiler had now had a good feed of corn, and he would only
<PB N="4" REF="037147_0003_100C957902457390">have to pu&s;h her a little more; &s;o to it he went.</P>
<P>He won the fir&s;t game. This &s;purred him on: and he played till it was &s;o dark they could not &s;ee a ball. Another bowl was called for from the winner. Wagers and betts now drained Brown not only of all the money he had won, but of all he had in his pocket, &s;o that he was obliged to a&s;k leave to go to the hou&s;e where his hor&s;e was, to borrow enough to di&s;charge his reckoning at the Globe.</P>
<P>All the&s;e lo&s;&s;es brought his poor dear mother to his mind, and he marched off with rather a heavy heart, to borrow the money, and to order Smiler out of the &s;table. The landlord expre&s;&s;ed much &s;urpri&s;e at &s;eeing him, and the o&s;tler de|clared there was no Smiler there; that &s;he had been rode off above two hours ago by the Merry Andrew, who &s;aid he came by order of the owner Mr. Brown to fetch her to the Globe, and to pay for her feed. It was indeed one of the neat|e&s;t tricks the Andrew ever performed,
<PB N="5" REF="037147_0004_100C957A8F4CFA18">for he had made &s;uch a clean conveyance of Smiler, that neither Jack nor his fa|ther ever heard of her again.</P>
<P>It was night. No one could tell what road the Andrew took, and it was ano|ther hour or two before an adverti&s;ement could be drawn up for apprehending the hor&s;e-&s;tealer. Jack had &s;ome doubts whether he &s;hould go on or return back. He knew that though his father might fear his wife mo&s;t, yet he loved Smiler be&s;t. At length he took that courage from a gla&s;s of brandy which he ought to have taken from a hearty repentance, and he re&s;olved to pur&s;ue his journey. He was obliged to leave his watch and &s;ilver buckles in pawn for a little old hack which was nothing but &s;kin and bone, and would hardly trot three miles an hour.</P>
<P>He knocked at his father's door about five in the morning. The family were all up. He a&s;ked the boy who opened the door how his mother was? "She is dead," &s;aid the boy, "&s;he died ye&s;ter|day
<PB N="6" REF="037147_0005_100C957C1B3FC4E0">afternoon." Here Jack's heart &s;mote him, and he cried aloud, partly from grief, but more from the reproaches of his own con&s;cience, for he found by computing the hours, that had he come &s;trait on, he &s;hould have been in time to have received his mother's ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The Farmer now called from within. "I hear Smiler's &s;tep. Is Jack come?" "Yes father," &s;aid Jack in a low voice. "Then," cried the Farmer, "run every man and boy of you and take care of the mare. Tom, do thou go and rub her down; Jem, run and get her a good feed of corn. Be &s;ure and walk her about that &s;he may not catch cold." Young Brown came in. "Are you not an undutiful dog?" &s;aid the father, "you might have been here twelve hours ago. Your mother could not die in peace with|out &s;eeing you. She &s;aid it was a cruel return for all her fondne&s;s that you could not make a little ha&s;te to &s;ee her; but it was always &s;o, for &s;he wronged her other children to help you, and this was her reward." Brown &s;obbed out a few
<PB N="7" REF="037147_0006_100C957E9AEB6B20">words, but his father replied, "Never cry Jack, for the boy told me that it was out of regard for Smiler that you were not here as &s;oon as he was; and if it was your over care of her, why there's no great harm done. You could not have &s;aved your poor mother, and you might have hurt the mare." Here Jack's double guilt flew into his face. He knew that his father was very covetous, and had li|ved on bad terms with his wife; and al&s;o that his own unkindne&s;s to her had been forgiven out of love to the hor&s;e; but to break to him how he had lo&s;t that hor&s;e through his own folly and want of feeling was more than Jack had courage to do. The old man however, &s;oon got at the truth, and no words can de&s;cribe his fury. Forgetting that his wife lay dead above &s;tairs, he abu&s;ed his &s;on in a way not fit to be repeated; and though his covetou&s;ne&s;s had ju&s;t before found an excu&s;e for neglecting to vi&s;it a dying parent, yet he now vented his rage a|gain&s;t Jack as an unnatural brute, whom he would cut off with a &s;hilling, and bade him never &s;ee his face again.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="037147_0007_100C9580F27655C0">Jack was not allowed to attend his mo|ther's funeral which was a real grief to him; nor would his father advance even the little money which was needful to redeem his things at the Star. He had now no fond mother to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and he &s;et out on his return home on his borrow|ed hack full of grief. He knew he had al&s;o lo&s;t a little hoard of money which his mother had &s;aved up for him.</P>
<P>When Brown got back to his own town he found that the &s;tory of Smiler and the Andrew had got thither before him, and it was thought a very good joke at the Greyhound. He &s;oon recovered his &s;pirits as far as related to the hor&s;e, but as to his behaviour to his dying mo|ther it troubled him at times to the la&s;t day of his life, though he did all he could to forget it. He did not however go on at all better, nor did he engage in one fro|lic the le&s;s for what pa&s;&s;ed at the Globe.</P>
<P>Jack began at length to feel the re|ver&s;e of that proverb, "Keep your &s;hop and your &s;hop will keep you." He had
<PB N="9" REF="037147_0008_100C9582830408A0">neglected his cu&s;tomers, and they for|&s;ook him. Quarter day came round; there was much to pay and little to receive. He owed two years rent. He was in arrears to his men for wages. He had a long account with his currier. It was in vain to apply to his father. He had now no mother. Stock was the only true friend he had in the world, and had helped him out of many petty &s;crapes, but he knew Stock would advance no money in &s;o hopele&s;s a ca&s;e. Duns came fa&s;t about him. He named a &s;peedy day for payment, but as &s;oon as they were out of the hou&s;e, and the danger put off to a little di&s;tance, he forgot every pro|mi&s;e, was as merry as ever, and run the &s;ame round of thoughtle&s;s gaiety. Whenever he was in trouble Stock did not &s;hun him, becau&s;e that was the mo|ment he thought to throw in a little good advice. He one day a&s;ked him if he always intended to go on in this cour&s;e? "No," &s;aid he, "I am re&s;olved bye-and-by to reform, grow &s;ober, and go to church. Why I am but five and twen|ty, man, I am &s;trong and healthy, and
<PB N="10" REF="037147_0009_100C95846FA69FA8">likely to live long, I can repent and grow melancholy and good at any time."</P>
<P>"Oh Jack," &s;aid Stock, don't cheat thy&s;elf with that fal&s;e hope. What thou do&s;t intend to do, do quickly. Did&s;t thou never hear about the heart growing hardened by long indulgence in &s;in? Some folk, who pretend to mean well, &s;how that they mean nothing at all, by never beginning to put their good re&s;o|lutions into practice; which made a wi&s;e man once &s;ay, that "hell is paved with good intentions."</P>
<P>Michaelmas Day was at hand. The Landlord declared he would be put off no longer, but would &s;eize for rent if it was not paid him on that day, as well as for a con&s;iderable &s;um due to him for leather. Brown now began to be frightened. He applied to Stock to be bound for him. This Stock flatly refu|&s;ed. Brown now began to dread the horrors of a jail, and really &s;eemed &s;o ve|ry contrite, and made &s;o many vows and promi&s;es of amendment, that at length
<PB N="11" REF="037147_0010_100C9586F9C955C0">Stock was prevailed on, together with two or three of Brown's other friends, to advance each a &s;mall &s;um of money to quiet the Landlord, Brown promi&s;ing to make over to them every part of his &s;tock, and to be guided in future by their advice, that he would turn over a new leaf, and follow Mr. Stock's example, as well as his directions in every thing.</P>
<P>Stock's good-nature was at la&s;t wrought upon, and he rai&s;ed the money. The truth is, he did not know the wor&s;t, or how deeply Brown was involv|ed, and Brown joyfully &s;et out at the very quarter day to a town at &s;ome di&s;|tance to carry his Landlord the money rai&s;ed by the imprudent kindne&s;s of his friend. At his departure Stock put him in mind of the old &s;tory of Smiler and the Merry Andrew, and he promi&s;ed of his own head that he would not even call at a public hou&s;e till he had paid the money.</P>
<P>He was as good as his word. He ve|ry triumphantly pa&s;&s;ed by &s;everal. He
<PB N="12" REF="037147_0011_100C9588EDA62C28">&s;topped a little under the window of one where the &s;ounds of merriment and loud laughter caught his ear. At another he he heard the enticing notes of a fiddle and the light heels of the merry dancers. Here his heart had well nigh failed him, but the dread of a jail on the one hand, and what he feared almo&s;t as much, Mr. Stock's anger on the other, &s;purred him on; and he valued him&s;elf not a little at having got the better of this temptation. He felt quite happy when he found he had reached the door of his landlord without having yielded to one idle incli|nation.</P>
<P>He knocked at the door. The maid who opened it &s;aid her ma&s;ter was not at home. "I am &s;orry for it," &s;aid he &s;trut|ting about, and with a boa&s;ting air took out his money. "I want to pay him my rent: he need not have been afraid of me." The &s;ervant, who knew her ma&s;ter was very much afraid of him, de|&s;ired him to walk in, her ma&s;ter would be at home in half an hour. "I will call again," &s;aid he: "but no, let him
<PB N="13" REF="037147_0012_100C958A7916EDE0">call on me, and the &s;ooner the better: I &s;hall be at the Blue Po&s;t." While he had been talking he took care to open his black leather ca&s;e, and to di&s;play the Bank Bills to the &s;ervant, and then, in a &s;waggering way, he put up his money and marched off to the Blue Po&s;ts.</P>
<P>He was by this time quite proud of his own re&s;olutions, and having tender|ed the money, and being clear in his own mind that it was the landlord's own fault that it was not paid, he went to refre&s;h him&s;elf at the Blue Po&s;ts. In a barn be|longing to this public hou&s;e &s;ome &s;trol|lers were ju&s;t going to perform &s;ome of that &s;ing-&s;ong ribaldry with which our villages are corrupted, the laws broken, and that money is drawn from the poor for plea&s;ure, which is wanted by their families for bread. The name of the la&s;t new &s;ong which made part of the enter|tainment, made him think him&s;elf in high luck, that he &s;hould have ju&s;t that half hour to &s;pare. He went into the barn, but was too much delighted with the actor who &s;ung his favourable &s;ong to
<PB N="14" REF="037147_0013_100C958C0A5946D8">remain a quiet hearer. He leaped out of the pit, and got behind the two rag|ged blankets which &s;erved for a curtain. He &s;ung &s;o much better than the actors them&s;elves, that they prai&s;ed and admi|red him to a degree which awakened all his vanity. He was &s;o intoxicated with their flattery, that he could do no le&s;s than invite them all to &s;upper, an invi|tation which they were too hungry not to accept.</P>
<P>He did not however quite forget his appointment with his landlord; but the half hour was long &s;ince pa&s;t by. "And &s;o," &s;ays he, "as I know he is a mean curmudgeon, who goes to bed I &s;uppo&s;e by day light to &s;ave candle, it will be too late to &s;peak with him to night&mdash;be|&s;ides, let him call upon me: it is his bu|&s;ine&s;s and not mine. I left word where I was to be found, the money is ready, and if I don't pay him to-night, I can do it before breakfa&s;t."</P>
<P>By the time the&s;e firm re&s;olutions were made &s;upper was ready. There never
<PB N="15" REF="037147_0014_100C958E508E76E0">was a more jolly evening. Ale and punch were as plenty as water. The actors &s;aw what a vain fellow was fea&s;t|ing them; and as they wanted victuals, and he wanted flattery, the bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;oon &s;ettled. They ate and Brown &s;ung. They pretended to be in raptures. Sing|ing promoted drinking, and every fre&s;h gla&s;s produced a &s;ong, or a &s;tory &s;till more merry than the former. Before morning tho&s;e who were engaged to act in another barn a dozen miles off &s;tole away quietly. Brown having dropt a&s;leep they left him to fini&s;h his nap by him&s;elf: as to him, his dreams were gay and plea&s;ant, and the hou&s;e being quite &s;till, he &s;lept comfortably till morning.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had breakfa&s;ted, the bu|&s;ine&s;s of the night before popped into his head. He &s;et off once more to his land|lord's in high &s;pirits, gaily &s;inging all the way &s;craps of all the tunes he had picked up the night before from his new friends. The landlord opened the door him&s;elf, and reproached him with no &s;mall &s;urli|ne&s;s for not having kept his word with
<PB N="16" REF="037147_0015_100C9590438AF3B0">him the evening before, adding, that he &s;uppo&s;ed he was now come with &s;ome more of his &s;hallow excu&s;es. Brown put on all that haughtine&s;s which is com|mon to people who are generally in the wrong, when they catch them&s;elves do|ing a right action, and looked big, as &s;ome &s;ort of people do, when they have money to pay. "You need not have been &s;o anxious about your money," &s;aid he, "I was not going to break or run away." The Landlord knew this was the common language of tho&s;e who were ready to do both. Brown haughti|ly added,&mdash;"You &s;hall &s;ee I am a man of my word; give me a receipt." The Landlord had it ready and gave it him.</P>
<P>Brown put his hand in his pocket for his black leather ca&s;e where the bills were, he felt, he &s;earched, he examined, fir&s;t one pocket, then the other, then both wai&s;tcoat pockets, but no leather ca&s;e could he find. He looked terrified. It was the face of real terror. The land|lord conceived it to be that of guilt, and abu&s;ed him heartily for putting his old
<PB N="17" REF="037147_0016_100C95929377E300">tricks upon him; he &s;wore he would not be impo&s;ed upon any longer, the money or a jail, there lay his choice.</P>
<P>Brown prote&s;ted for once with great truth, that he had no intention to de|ceive; that he had actually brought the money, and knew not what was become of it; but the thing was far too unlikely to gain credit. Brown now called to mind that he had fallen a&s;leep on the &s;et|tle in the room where they had &s;upped. This rai&s;ed his &s;pirits. He had no doubt but the ca&s;e had fallen out of his pocket, &s;aid he would &s;tep to the public-hou&s;e and &s;earch for it, and would be back di|rectly. Not one word of all this did the landlord believe, &s;o inconvenient is it to have a bad character. He &s;wore Brown &s;hould not &s;tir out of his hou&s;e without a con&s;table, and made him wait while he &s;ent for one. Brown, guarded by the con&s;table, went back to the Blue Po&s;ts. The landlord charging the officer not to lo&s;e &s;ight of the culprit. The caution was needle&s;s, Brown had not the lea&s;t de&s;ign of running away, &s;o firmly per|&s;uaded
<PB N="18" REF="037147_0017_100C95941EEA6DC0">was he that he &s;hould find his lea|ther ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But who can paint his di&s;may, when no tale or tidings of the leather ca&s;e could be had. The ma&s;ter, the mi&s;tre&s;s, the boy, and the maid of the public hou&s;e all prote&s;ted they were innocent. His &s;u&s;picions &s;oon fell on the &s;trollers with whom he had pa&s;&s;ed the night. And he now found out for the fir&s;t time that a merry evening did not always pro|duce a happy morning. He obtained a warrant, and proper officers were &s;ent in pur&s;uit of the &s;trollers. No one how|ever believed he had lo&s;t any thing. And as he had not a &s;hilling left to defray the expen&s;ive treat he had given, the ma&s;ter of the inn agreed with the other landlord in thinking this &s;tory was a trick to de|fraud both. Brown remained in clo&s;e cu&s;tody. At length the officers returned, who &s;aid they had been obliged to let the &s;trollers go, as they could not fix the charge on any one, and they had all offered to &s;wear before a ju&s;tice that they had &s;een nothing of the leather ca&s;e.
<PB N="19" REF="037147_0018_100C9595D4604730">And it was agreed that as he had pa&s;&s;ed the evening in a crowded barn, he had probably been robbed there of it all; and among &s;o many who could pretend to gue&s;s at the thief?</P>
<P>Brown raved like a madman, he cried and tore his hair, &s;aid he was ruined for ever. The abu&s;ive language of his old landlord, and his new creditor at the Blue Po&s;ts, did not lighten his &s;orrow. His landlord would be put off no longer. Brown declared he could neither find bail nor rai&s;e another &s;hilling, and as &s;oon as the forms of law were made out, he was &s;ent to the county jail.</P>
<P>Here it might have been expected that hard living and much lei&s;ure would have brought him to reflect a little on his pa&s;t follies. But his heart was not truly touched. The chief thing which griev|ed him at fir&s;t was, his having abu&s;ed the kindne&s;s of Stock, for to him he &s;hould appear guilty of a real fraud, where he had indeed been only vain, idle, and imprudent. And it is worth while
<PB N="20" REF="037147_0019_100C9598CA530160">here to remark that vanity, idlene&s;s, and imprudence, often bring a man to ruin both &s;oul and body, though &s;illy peo|ple do not put them in the catalogue of heavy &s;ins, and tho&s;e who indulge them are often reckoned good hone&s;t merry fellows.</P>
<P>Brown was no &s;ooner lodged in his doleful habitation, and a little recovered from his fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, than he &s;at down and wrote his friend Stock the whole hi&s;tory of the tran&s;action. Mr. Stock, who had long known the exceeding light|ne&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation of his mind, did not &s;o utterly di&s;believe the &s;tory as all the other creditors did. To &s;peak the truth, Stock was the only one among them who had good &s;en&s;e enough to know, that a man may be completely ruined, both in what relates to his prop|erty and his &s;oul, without committing Old Bailey crimes. He knew that idle|ne&s;s, vanity, and the love of <HI>pleasure,</HI> as it is fal&s;ely called, will bring a man to a mor&s;el of bread, as &s;urely as tho&s;e things which are reckoned much greater
<PB N="21" REF="037147_0020_100C959AB68438F8">&s;ins; and that they undermine his prin|ciples as certainly, though not perhaps quite &s;o fa&s;t.</P>
<P>Stock was too angry with what had happened to an&s;wer Brown's letter, or to &s;eem to take the lea&s;t notice of him. However, he kindly and &s;ecretly under|took a journey to the hard hearted old Farmer, Brown's father, to intercede with him, and to &s;ee if he would do any thing for his &s;on. Stock did not pretend to excu&s;e Jack, or even to le&s;&s;en his of|fences; for it was a rule of his never to di&s;gui&s;e truth or to palliate wickedne&s;s. Sin was &s;till &s;in in his eyes, though it were committed by his be&s;t friend; but though he would not &s;often the &s;in he felt tenderly for the &s;inner. He plead|ed with the old Farmer on the ground that his &s;on's idlene&s;s and other vices would gather fre&s;h &s;trength in a jail. He told him that the loo&s;e and worthle&s;s company which he would there keep, would harden him in vice, and if he was now wicked he might there become irreclaimable.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="037147_0021_100C959C48671B98">But all his pleas were urged in vain. The farmer was not to be moved. In|deed he argued with &s;ome ju&s;tice, that he ought not to make his indu&s;trious children beggars to &s;ave one rogue from the gallows. Mr. Stock allowed the force of this rea&s;on, though he &s;aw the father was le&s;s influenced by this prin|ciple of ju&s;tice than by re&s;entment on account of the old Story of Smiler.</P>
<P>Mr. Stock at length wrote to poor Jack; not to offer him any help, that was quite out of the que&s;tion, but "to exhort him to repent of his evil ways; to lay before him the &s;ins of his pa&s;t life, and to advi&s;e him to convert the pre&s;ent puni&s;hment into a benefit, by humbling him&s;elf before God."</P>
<P>If Mr. Stock had &s;ent him a good &s;um of money to procure his liberty, or even a trifle to make merry with his wretched companions, Jack would have thought him a friend indeed. But to &s;end him nothing but dry advice, and a few words of empty comfort, was, he thought, but
<PB N="23" REF="037147_0022_100C959ED18A2490">a cheap &s;habby way of &s;hewing his kind|ne&s;s. Unluckily the letter came ju&s;t as he was going to &s;it down to one of tho&s;e direful merry-makings which are often carried on with brutal riot within the doleful walls of a jail on the entrance of a new pri&s;oner, who is often expected to give a fea&s;t to the re&s;t.</P>
<P>When his companions were heated with gin, "Now" &s;ays Jack, "I'll treat you with a &s;ermon, and a very pretty preachment it is." So &s;aying he took out Mr. Stock's kind and pious letter, and was delighted at the bur&s;ts of laugh|ter it produced. "What a canting dog!" &s;aid one. "Repentance indeed!" cried Tom Crew, "No, no, Jack, tell this hypocritical rogue that if we have lo&s;t our liberty, it is only for having been jolly, hearty fellows, and we have more &s;pirit than to repent of that I hope: all the harm we have done is living a little too fa&s;t, like hone&s;t bucks as we are." Aye, aye, &s;aid Jolly George, "had we been &s;uch &s;neaking mi&s;erly fellows as Stock, we need not have come hither.
<PB N="24" REF="037147_0023_100C95A163A6A1F8">But if the ill-nature of the laws has clapped up &s;uch fine hearty blades, we are no <HI>felons</HI> however. We are afraid of no Jack Ketch; and I &s;ee no cau&s;e to repent of any &s;in that's not hanging matter. For tho&s;e who are thru&s;t into the condemned hole indeed, and have but a few hours to live, they <HI>must</HI> &s;ee the Par&s;on, and hear a &s;ermon and &s;uch &s;tuff. But I do not know what &s;uch &s;tout young fellows as we are have to do with repentance. And &s;o Jack, let us have that rare new catch which you learnt of the &s;trollers that merry night when you lo&s;t your pocket book."</P>
<P>Brown &s;pent one part of his time in thoughtle&s;s riot, and the other in gloom and &s;adne&s;s. Company kept up his &s;pi|rits; with his new friends he contrived to drown thought; but when he was alone he began to find that a <HI>merry fel|low,</HI> when deprived of his companions and his liquor, is often a mo&s;t forlorn wretch. Then it is, that even a merry fellow &s;ays of laughter, "What is it? and of mirth it is madne&s;s."</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="037147_0024_100C95A2F1B649B0">As he contrived, however, to be as little alone as po&s;&s;ible, his gaiety was commonly uppermo&s;t, till that loath|&s;ome di&s;temper called the Jail Fever, broke out in the pri&s;on. He &s;oon caught the di&s;temper, and that in &s;o dreadful a degree, that his life was in great dan|ger. He lay in the mo&s;t deplorable condition; his body tormented with a dreadful di&s;ea&s;e, and his &s;oul terrified and amazed at the approach of death; that death, which he thought at &s;o great a di&s;tance, and of which his comrades had a&s;&s;ured him, that a young fellow of five and twenty was in no danger. Poor Jack! I cannot help feeling for him. Without a &s;hilling! without a friend! without one comfort re&s;pecting this world, and, what is far more terible, without one hope re&s;pecting the next.</P>
<P>A Chri&s;tian friend generally comes forward at the very time when wordly friends for&s;ake the wretched. The other pri&s;oners would not come near Brown, though he had often entertained and never offended them, even his own
<PB N="26" REF="037147_0025_100C95A525760EB0">father was not moved with his &s;ad con|dition. When Mr. Stock informed him of it, he an&s;wered, "'tis no more than he de&s;erves. As he brews &s;o he mu&s;t bake. He has made his own bed, and let him lie in it." The hard old man had ever at his tongue's end &s;ome pro|verb which he contrived to turn in &s;uch a way as to excu&s;e him&s;elf.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now &s;ee how Mr. Stock be|haved. He had his favourite &s;ayings too, but they were chiefly on the &s;ide of kindne&s;s, mercy or &s;ome other virtue. "I mu&s;t not," &s;aid he, "pretend to call my&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, if I do not re|quite evil for good." When he received the jailer's letter with the account of Brown's &s;ad condition, Will Simp&s;on and Tommy Williams began to compli|ment him on his own wi&s;dom and pru|dence, by which he had e&s;caped Brown's misfortunes. He only gravely &s;aid, "Ble&s;&s;ed be God that I am not in the &s;ame mi&s;ery. It is <HI>He</HI> who has made us to differ. But for <HI>his</HI> grace I might have been in no better condition. Now
<PB N="27" REF="037147_0026_100C95A769194168">Brown is brought low by the hand of God, it is my time to go to him." "What you," &s;aid Will, "whom he cheated of your money?" "This is not a time to remember injuries," &s;aid Mr. Stock. "How can I a&s;k forgivene&s;s for my own &s;ins, if I withhold forgivene&s;s from him?" So &s;aying he ordered his hor&s;e, and &s;et off to &s;ee poor Brown, thus proving that his was a religion not of words but of deeds.</P>
<P>Stock's heart nearly failed him as he pa&s;&s;ed through the pri&s;on. The groans of the &s;ick and dying, and what to &s;uch a heart as his was &s;till more moving, the brutal merriment of the healthy in &s;uch a place, pierced his very &s;oul. Many a &s;ilent prayer did he put as he pa&s;&s;ed along, that GOD would yet be plea&s;ed to touch their hearts, and that "now (during this infectious &s;ickne&s;s) might be the accepted time." The jailor ob&s;erved him drop a tear, and a&s;k|ed the cau&s;e. "I cannot forget," &s;aid he, "that the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute of the&s;e is &s;till my fellow creature. The &s;ame GOD
<PB N="28" REF="037147_0027_100C95AA0EBA8DB8">made them; the &s;ame SAVIOUR died for them, how then can I hate the wor&s;t of them? With my advantages they might have been much better than I am; without the ble&s;&s;ing of God on my good Mini&s;ter's in&s;tructions, I might have been wor&s;e than the wor&s;t of the&s;e. I have no cau&s;e for pride, much for thank|fulne&s;s; <HI>let us not be high-minded but fear.</HI>"</P>
<P>It would have moved a heart of &s;tone to have &s;een poor mi&s;erable Jack Brown lying on his wretched bed, his face &s;o changed by pain, poverty, dirt and &s;or|row, that he could hardly be known for that "merry &s;oul of a jack boot," as he u&s;ed to be called. His groans were &s;o piteous that it made Mr. Stock's heart ach. He kindly took him by the hand, though he knew the di&s;temper was catch|ing. "How do&s;t do Jack?" &s;aid he, "do&s;t know me?" Brown &s;hook his head and &s;aid faintly, "know you? aye, that I do. I am &s;ure I have but one friend in the world who would come to &s;ee me in this woeful condition. O
<PB N="29" REF="037147_0028_100C95AB99CF3938">James! what have I brought my&s;elf to? What will become of my poor &s;oul? I dare not look back, for that is all &s;in, nor forwards, for that is all mi&s;ery and woe."</P>
<P>Mr. Stock &s;poke kindly to him, but did not attempt to chear him with fal&s;e comfort, as is too often done. "I am a&s;hamed to &s;ee you in this dirty place," &s;ays Brown. "As to the place Jack," replied the other, "if it has helped to bring you to a &s;en&s;e of your pa&s;t offences, it will be no bad place for you. I am heartily &s;orry for your di&s;tre&s;s and your &s;ickne&s;s; but if it &s;hould plea&s;e God by them to open your eyes, and to &s;hew you that &s;in is a greater evil than the pri&s;on to which it has brought you, all may yet be well; I had rather &s;ee you in this humble penitent &s;tate, lying on this dir|ty bed, in this di&s;mal pri&s;on, than roar|ing and rioting at the Greyhound, the king of the company, with hand&s;ome cloaths on your back, and plenty of mo|ney in your pocket."</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="037147_0029_100C95AD278533E8">Brown wept bitterly and &s;queezed his hand, but was too weak to &s;ay much. Mr. Stock then de&s;ired the jailor to let him have &s;uch things as were needful and he would pay for them. He would not leave the poor fellow till he had given him with his own hands &s;ome broth which the jailor had got ready for him, and &s;ome medicines which the Doctor had &s;ent. All this kindne&s;s cut Brown to the heart. He was ju&s;t able to &s;ob out "my unnatural father leaves me to peri&s;h, and my injured friend is more than a father to me." Stock told him that one proof he mu&s;t give of his repen|tance was, that he mu&s;t forgive his fa|ther, who&s;e provocation had been very great. He then &s;aid he would leave him for the pre&s;ent to take &s;ome re&s;t, and de&s;ired him to lift up his heart to God for mercy. "Dear James," replied Brown, "do you pray for me? God per|haps may hear you, but he never will hear the prayer of &s;uch a &s;inner as I have been." "Take care how you think &s;o," &s;aid Stock. "To believe that God can|not forgive you would be &s;till a greater
<PB N="31" REF="037147_0030_100C95B0C0A7F418">&s;in than any you have yet committed again&s;t him." He then explained to him in a few words, as well as he was able, the nature of repentance, and forgive|ne&s;s through a Saviour, and warned him earne&s;tly again&s;t unbelief and hardne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>Poor Jack grew much refre&s;hed in bo|dy with the comfortable things he had taken; and a little cheered with Stock's kindne&s;s in coming &s;o far to &s;ee, and to forgive &s;uch a forlorn outca&s;t, &s;ick of an infectious di&s;temper, and locked within the walls of a pri&s;on. "Surely" &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "there mu&s;t be &s;ome mighty power in a religion which can lead men to do &s;uch things! things &s;o much again&s;t the grain as to forgive &s;uch an injury, and to ri&s;k catching &s;uch a di&s;temper," but he was &s;o weak he could not expre&s;s this in words. He tried to pray, but he could not, at length overpowered with wearine&s;s, he fell fa&s;t a&s;leep.</P>
<P>When Mr. Stock came back, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find him &s;o much better in
<PB N="32" REF="037147_0031_100C95B2C1D734E8">body; but his agonies of mind were dreadful, and he had now got &s;trength to expre&s;s part of the horrors which he felt, "James," &s;aid he, (looking wildly) "it is all over with me. I am a lo&s;t crea|ture. Even your prayers cannot &s;ave me." "Dear Jack, replied Mr. Stock I am no mini&s;ter: it does not become me to talk much to thee: but I know I may venture to &s;ay whatever is in the Bible. As ignorant as I am I &s;hall be &s;afe enough while I &s;tick to that." Aye, &s;aid the &s;ick man, you u&s;ed to be ready enough to read to me, and I would not li&s;ten, or if I did it was only to make fun of what I heard, and now you will not &s;o much as read a bit of a chapter to me.</P>
<P>This was the very point to which Stock longed to bring him. So he took a little bible out of his pocket, which he always carried with him on a journey, and read &s;lowly ver&s;e by ver&s;e, the 55th chapter of I&s;aiah. When he came to the &s;ixth and &s;eventh ver&s;es, poor Jack cried &s;o much that Stock was forced to &s;top. The words were, "Let the wicked man
<PB N="33" REF="037147_0032_100C839B8605FA18">for&s;ake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord." Here Brown &s;topped him, &s;aying, Oh it is too late, too late for me. Let me fini&s;h the ver&s;e &s;aid Stock, and you will &s;ee your error; you will &s;ee that it is never too late. So he read on&mdash;"let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, and he will abun|dantly pardon." Here Brown &s;tarted up, &s;natched the book out of his hand and cried out, Is that really there? No, no; that's of your own putting in, in order to comfort me; let me look at the words my&s;elf." "No, indeed," &s;aid Stock, "I would not for the world give you unfounded comfort, or put off any notion of my own for a &s;cripture doc|trine." "But is it po&s;&s;ible!" cried the &s;ick man, "that God may really pardon me? Do'&s;t think he can? Do'&s;t think he will?" "I am &s;ure of it," &s;aid Stock; "I dare not give thee fal&s;e hopes, or, indeed any hopes of my own. But the&s;e are God's own words, and the only dif|ficulty is to know when we are really
<PB N="34" REF="037147_0033_100C95B641392410">brought into &s;uch a &s;tate as that the words may be applied to us.</P>
<P>Mr. Stock was afraid of &s;aying more. He would not venture out of his depth; nor, indeed, was poor Brown able to bear more di&s;cour&s;e ju&s;t now. So he made him a pre&s;ent of the Bible, folding down &s;uch places as he thought might be be&s;t &s;uited to his &s;tate, and he took his leave, being obliged to return home that night. He left a little money with the jailor, to add a few comforts to the allowance of the pri&s;on, and promi&s;ed to return in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>When he got home, he de&s;cribed the &s;ufferings and mi&s;ery of Brown in a ve|ry moving manner; but Tommy Willi|ams, in&s;tead of being properly affected at it, only &s;aid, "Indeed, Ma&s;ter, I am not very &s;orry; he is rightly &s;erved." "How, Tommy," &s;aid Mr. Stock, ra|ther &s;ternly, "not &s;orry to &s;ee a fellow creature brought to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of mi&s;ery? one too whom you have known &s;o pro&s;perous!" "No, Ma&s;ter, I can't
<PB N="35" REF="037147_0034_100C95B909A42F78">&s;ay I am; for Mr. Brown u&s;ed to make fun of you, and laugh at you for being &s;o godly, and reading your Bible."</P>
<P>"Let me &s;ay a few words to you Tommy," &s;aid Mr. Stock. "In the fir&s;t place you &s;hould never watch for the time of a man's being brought low by trouble to tell of his faults. Next, you &s;hould never rejoice at his trouble, but pity him, and pray for him. La&s;tly, as to his ridiculing me for my religion, if I cannot &s;tand an idle jo&s;t, I am not worthy the name of a Chri&s;tian.&mdash;<HI>He that is ashamed of me and my word,</HI> do'&s;t remember what follows, Tommy?" "Yes, Ma&s;ter, 'twas la&s;t Sunday's text &mdash;<HI>of him shall the Son of Man be asha|med when he shall judge the world.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Stock &s;oon went back to the pri|&s;on. But he did not go alone. He took with him Mr. Thomas, the worthy Mini&s;ter who had been the guide and in&s;tructor of his youth, who was &s;o kind as to go at his reque&s;t and vi&s;it this for|lorn pri&s;oner. When they got to Brown's
<PB N="36" REF="037147_0035_100C95BA951CB578">door, they found him &s;itting up in his bed with the Bible in his hand. This was a joyful &s;ight to Mr. Stock, who &s;e|cretly thanked God for it. Brown was reading aloud; they li&s;tened; it was the fifteenth of Saint Luke. The circum|&s;tances of this beautiful Parable of the Prodigal Son were &s;o much like his own, that the &s;tory pierced him to the &s;oul; and he &s;topped every minute to com|pare his own ca&s;e with that of the Pro|digal. He was ju&s;t got to the eighteenth ver&s;e, <HI>I will arise and go to my father,</HI>&mdash; at that moment he &s;pied his two friends; joy darted into his eyes. "O dear Jem," &s;aid he, "it is <HI>not</HI> too late, I will ari&s;e and go to my father, my heavenly fa|ther, and you, Sir, will &s;hew me the way, won't you?" &s;aid he to Mr. Tho|mas, whom he recollected. "I am very glad to &s;ee you in &s;o hopeful a di&s;po&s;iti|on," &s;aid the good Mini&s;ter. "O, Sir," &s;aid Brown. "what a place is this to re|ceive you in! O, &s;ee to what I have brought my&s;elf!"</P>
