<HEAD>Eulogy.</HEAD>
<P>HOW great are the trophies of inexora|ble Death! How honorable the tears of this great a&s;&s;embly! How expre&s;&s;ive the &s;ymbols of public &s;orrow, which every where attract the eye! ILLUSTRIOUS SHADE, coulde&s;t thou de&s;cend from the high &s;eats of glory, thou woulde&s;t li&s;ten with complacence to the &s;ighs of a mourning EMPIRE.</P>
<P>PIOUS gratitude, my FELLOW CITIZENS, has this day a&s;&s;embled us in the TEMPLE OF THE LORD OF HOSTS. As men, we ought to retrace the hi&s;|tory of our obligations; and as Chri&s;tians, it is our duty to imprint it on the tablet of memory. We have met to cultivate the be&s;t &s;en&s;ibilities of the &s;oul; to indulge the luxury of &s;ympathy; to mu&s;e on the recollection of greatne&s;s no more; and to embalm with our tears the URN OF THE VENERABLE WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>THIS example we were taught by ancient RE|PUBLICS. At the public funeral of tho&s;e ATHE|NIANS, who were fir&s;t &s;lain in the war of PELO|PONNESUS, an Eulogy to their memory was pro|nounced by Pericles. It was to animate the living to imitate the virtues of the dead. Thus likewi&s;e, when the great &s;oul of the fir&s;t BRUTUS winged its flight to the enjoyment of cele&s;tial liberty, the
<PB N="4" REF="038623_0003_1012A9A5E848E978">
Councils of ROME ordained the mo&s;t public te&s;ti|monials of &s;orrow; and female beauty, in grief for the lo&s;s of its noble avenger, &s;hrouded its charms in &s;ackcloth.</P>
<P>GEORGE WASHINGTON was born Feb. 11, 1732, O. S. His early youth gave proofs that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no common mind. At the age of fif|teen&punc; he received a naval commi&s;&s;ion; but paren|tal affection, or rather the de&s;tinies of Heaven, re|&s;erved him for a nobler fate. The ILLUSTRIOUS HERO, whom we this day celebrate, commenced his public career by a commi&s;&s;ion to Canada, then under the dominion of FRANCE. He di&s;charged this tru&s;t with indu&s;try, intelligence, and addre&s;s. His military talents were fir&s;t di&s;played in the field where fell the unfortunate Braddock: and here the tried courage of veterans confe&s;&s;ed its inferi|ority to his youth. In 1759, di&s;ea&s;e threatened his precious life; but Virtue watched over her &s;on, and he lived, that he might die with the ble&s;&s;ings of millions. He progre&s;&s;ed in life honor|ably and honored. As an in&s;tructor in arms, a repre&s;entative of <HI>Freemen,</HI> and a guardian of ju&s;|tice, he &s;hone con&s;picuous. Fortune, virtue, and dome&s;tic joys,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He married Mrs. Cu&s;tis, who is &s;till living.</NOTE> were his friends, and all united to make him happy.</P>
<P>ROUSED from the&s;e peaceful &s;cenes by the voice of his country's wrongs, and placed by CONGRESS at the head of an army, &s;carcely in being, without arms, undi&s;ciplined, and &s;trong only in the good|ne&s;s of its cau&s;e, he accepted the tru&s;t with that
<PB N="5" REF="038623_0004_1012A9AA1B6653F8">
mode&s;ty, which is the companion of true greatne&s;s. When the important commi&s;&s;ion was pre&s;ented him by the Pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s, on the &s;ucce&s;s of which, in the view of an ill-judging world, de|pended his glory or his infamy, "Sir," &s;aid he, "though I am truly &s;en&s;ible of the high honor done me in this appointment, yet I feel great di&s;tre&s;s, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that my abilities and military experience may not be equal to the exten&s;ive and important tru&s;t. And le&s;t &s;ome unlucky event &s;hould happen, unfavorable to my reputation, I beg it may be remembered by ev|ery gentleman in the room, that I this day de|clare, with the utmo&s;t &s;incerity, that I do not think my&s;elf equal to the command I am hon|ored with."</P>
<P>IN the pro&s;ecution of our great and glorious revolutionary war, what a field of triumph opens on the mind! I might &s;how our HERO &s;truggling with difficulties, which, to minds le&s;s than his, would have been in&s;uperable; I might point to him, great in victory, but greater in misfortune. With the fortitude of CAESAR, the prudence of FABIUS, and the unyielding virtue of OLD REGU|LUS, he &s;ternly buffetted the adver&s;e waves of war. And ye, his companions, ye noble defenders of our country's rights; while we weep over the tomb of your IMMORTAL CHIEF, your &s;ervices are deep|ly engraved on our hearts, and your honor will ever be dear to fame.</P>
<P>AT the clo&s;e of the AMERICAN REVOLUTION, a circum&s;tance occurred, in which General WASH|INGTON
<PB N="6" REF="038623_0005_1012A9ABAAACB2A8">
di&s;played a moderation, fortitude, and patrioti&s;m, unrivalled in the mo&s;t virtuous peri|od of antiquity. Deep di&s;content had pervaded the ranks of the army. This &s;pirit threatened to de&s;troy the TREE OF INDEPENDENCE, ju&s;t tran&s;|planted into our &s;oil, before we had ta&s;ted its fruit. Had not OUR HERO loved his country, more than the mo&s;t &s;plendid title of dignity; had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed a &s;oul like that of CAESAR; he would have &s;eized this happy moment, and a&s;&s;umed the <HI>Impe|rial Authority.</HI> He might then have been number|ed among the &s;ucce&s;sful conquerors of others; but his glory a&s;pired to the more difficult, and far nobler conque&s;t of him&s;elf. He a&s;&s;embled around him his veteran brothers; a tear, &s;uch as angels &s;hed at &s;pectacles of human weakne&s;s, dropped on his venerable cheek; he &s;poke to them of the in|trigues of emi&s;&s;aries, of the honor of &s;oldiers, and of the duty of citizens. He &s;poke to the rea&s;on, but awoke every pa&s;&s;ion. He retired&mdash;it was the voice of their father, which they had been accu&s;|tomed to obey; and they in&s;tantly <HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> THAT THE ARMY CONTINUED TO HAVE AN UNSHAKEN CONFIDENCE IN THE JUSTICE OF CONGRESS AND THEIR COUNTRY.</P>
<P>THIS great EXEMPLAR of precept had now on|ly to crown his military, by a brilliant di&s;play of civic virtues. VERNON'S EDEN received the AMERICAN CINCINNATUS; but its peaceful &s;hades &s;erved only to increa&s;e the lu&s;tre of his laurels. It was the roof of ho&s;pitality, the delightful re&s;idence of &s;entiment and virtue. Thither re&s;orted the

Philo&s;opher and Traveller; for WASHINGTON was the <HI>Star,</HI> which attracted the "wi&s;e men" of the world. Even KINGS and POTENTATES paid homage to his virtues, reflecting by this &s;ome &s;hare of glory on them&s;elves.</P>
<P>WERE I here to fini&s;h the portrait, I &s;hould do inju&s;tice to the character of one, whom all the world admires. If as a SOLDIER he excelled, as a SENATOR he a&s;toni&s;hed; if as a WARRIOR he was magnanimous, as a STATESMAN he was profound. His activity and bravery in the field rendered him an HOST, and his &s;agacity in the cabinet rai&s;|ed him &s;uperior to all political delu&s;ion. His wi&s;|dom regulated the deci&s;ions of jarring councils; his goodne&s;s charmed the affections of the people, and his ARM cru&s;hed their enemies. Faithful to his GOD, could he be unfaithful to his COUNTRY? Not malignity, not calumny, nor envy, which loves to prey on goodne&s;s, can charge him with one habitual vice.</P>
<P>AS PRESIDENT of the CONVENTION, which formed our NATIONAL CONSTITUTION, he gave it his entire approbation; and perhaps it is not too much to &s;ay, that to this circum&s;tance it owed its e&s;tabli&s;hment. AMERICANS, this is the great pal|ladium of your honor and felicity; it connects liberty with honor, the happine&s;s with the rights of Citizens. It is an experiment on the que&s;tion, whether mankind can bear to be free. Let me tell you, if you &s;uffer foreign or dome&s;tic in|trigues to wre&s;t this invaluable inheritance from your hands, you will richly de&s;erve to be <HI>Slaves.</HI></P>

AMONG the many illu&s;trious characters, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in our glorious &s;trug|gle for Independence, WASHINGTON was &s;o pre-eminent, that all eyes were turned to him as a common centre; and twice, by the unanimous &s;uffrages of the nation, he was declared the RULER OF THE FREE.</P>
<P>AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, how important were his &s;ervices! I tru&s;t while grati|tude is a virtue, we &s;hall not forget them. In this, were it po&s;&s;ible, rather than in his military character, he is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the INSTRUMEN|TAL SAVIOUR OF HIS COUNTRY.</P>
<P>AS a FRIEND OF VIRTUE, he firmly oppo&s;ed the Athei&s;tical opinions of the day; as a PATRIOT, he pre&s;ented his brea&s;t to the dangers, which threat|ened his country's peace. To him, the voice of the people was always an intere&s;ting con&s;idera|tion; but though few among the great can re&s;i&s;t the charms of popular applau&s;e, though none ever enjoyed more popularity than WASHINGTON, yet HE ever preferred the dictates of his own in|corruptible mind, to the violence of the incon&s;tant multitude. At a moment, when foreign intrigue &s;ucceeded, when the popular pa&s;&s;ions were rai&s;ed into a ferment, he was reque&s;ted not to do<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sanction the Briti&s;h Treaty by his &s;ignature.</NOTE> what his &s;ound judgment dictated: he firmly replied, <HI>I have determined on the duty before me.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Pre&s;ident's An&s;wer to various Addre&s;&s;es.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the Addre&s;s to the people of the&s;e States, de|clining again their &s;uffrages, he &s;eemed to concen|trate all his great qualities. It has ju&s;tly been e&s;|teemed
<PB N="9" REF="038623_0008_1012A9B5A7F50100">
the LEGACY OF A FATHER. It has been pre&s;erved in the archives of our country; let it be deeply engraved on our minds; for the heart which conceived it cea&s;es to beat, and the hand which wrote it will ri&s;e no more. He retired again.&mdash;I a&s;k you, my fellow-citizens, did not our prayers go with him? did we not all &s;ay, 'Peace to the HERO'S re&s;t? May guardian &s;pirits watch his declining years, and may his grey heirs, <HI>with|out</HI> &s;orrow, come to the grave!' But before he was to be called to the communion of CELESTIAL SPIRITS, his war-worn &s;inews were again to renew their youthful vigor, and again he ro&s;e with the Fabii and Decii to avenge his country's wrongs.</P>
<P>IN his Letter to PRESIDENT ADAMS, in which he accepts the command of the American armies, he di&s;plays that &s;ame unappalled courage, that &s;trength of intellect, and that zeal for his coun|try's honor, which had formerly been exerted with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the power of GREAT BRITAIN. "The conduct," &s;ays he, "of the DIRECTORY OF FRANCE towards our country; their in&s;idious ho&s;tility to its government; their various prac|tices to withdraw the affections of the people from it; the evident tendency of their acts, and tho&s;e of their agents, to countenance and invigorate op|po&s;ition; their di&s;regard of &s;olemn treaties, and the law of nations; their war upon our defence|le&s;s commerce; their treatment of our mini&s;ters of peace; and their demands amounting to trib|ute, could not fail to excite in my mind, corre&s;|ponding &s;entiments with tho&s;e my countrymen

have &s;o generally expre&s;&s;ed, in their affectionate addre&s;&s;es to you. Believe me, Sir, no one can more cordially approve of the wi&s;e and prudent mea&s;ures of your admini&s;tration. Satisfied that you have &s;incerely wi&s;hed for peace, and endeav|ored to avert war, and exhau&s;ted to the <HI>la&s;t drop</HI> the cup of reconciliation, we can with pure hearts appeal to Heaven for the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e." With what &s;pirit did this appointment animate every cla&s;s of citizens; America &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s one &s;oul. The young men a&s;&s;umed the &s;oldier's character, and even the enfeebled veteran gra&s;ped his arms, which he had fondly hoped would ru&s;t in quiet.</P>
<P>AND why do I hear the &s;olemn knell of death? Why am I &s;urrounded with the&s;e habiliments of the grave? Why that gloom on your counte|nances? Why that involuntary tear, which I &s;ee &s;tart from your eyes? I hear the &s;ad re&s;pon&s;e, OUR FATHER IS NO MORE.</P>
<P>HIS FRIENDS and COMPANIONS IN ARMS encir|cle his grave. You have &s;een him, like &s;ome &s;u|perior form, leading you to glory and victory. You have heard him in the embattled ranks, an|imating you to conte&s;t by motives of duty and patrioti&s;m; and you have &s;een him weep over the &s;oldier's wounds. <HI>"How have the mighty fallen!"</HI> That countenance which beamed benevolence, and that &s;tature which in&s;pired confidence, lie &s;hrouded in death. VERNON, from the PARADISE, is converted into the MAUSOLEUM of AMERICA. Its trophies are now the trophies of death. But

we will not forget thee. The tomb of WASH|INGTON &s;hall be the ALTAR of LIBERTY. When ages on ages have revolved, when we and our children are numbered with the &s;ilent dead, thith|er will re&s;ort the friends of freedom; and while his happy &s;pirit beholds with complacency the af|fecting &s;cene, they will appeal to Heaven, that they will &s;ave their country.</P>
<P>MY FELLOW-CITIZENS, by who&s;e appointment I &s;tand in this place, will accept my &s;incere condo|lence on this &s;olemn and affecting occa&s;ion. It is the la&s;t tribute of re&s;pect, which we can pay to the memory of a MAN, who &s;till lives enthroned in all our hearts. It is re&s;pectful to the revered decea&s;|ed, and is it not honorable to our nature? Yes, our tears are honorable to our&s;elves! Could our WASHINGTON once more addre&s;s us from the BRIGHT ARMIES of the SKY, what would he &s;ay? 'Weep not for me, my children. Your individ|ual and political happine&s;s depends on your rev|erence to GOD, and your devotion to your coun|try. Cheri&s;h the virtues, and obey the laws.

<P>THE YOUNGER CITIZENS demand our &s;ympa|thy and attention. Re&s;pect for the character, gratitude for the &s;ervices, and grief for the death of your POLITICAL PARENT, has covered you with mourning. When yet in infancy, before

If ever your &s;en&s;ibilities were awakened, it mu&s;t be on this occa&s;ion; for you have cau&s;e to weep. Study, my young friends, the HERO'S LEGACY; it will &s;hew you the true intere&s;t of your country, and make you po|litically wife. Let the impre&s;&s;ive &s;olemnities of this day be fixed on your minds. And as the mo&s;t &s;acred of all duties, as you regard the dear|e&s;t intere&s;ts of your&s;elves and country, pre&s;erve your minds uncontaminated by the religious and political here&s;ies of the day, which will inevitably lead to the de&s;truction of all government, of all &s;o|cial order, and of public happine&s;s.</P>
<P>WE pa&s;s to the clo&s;ing &s;cene. The AMERICAN FABIUS died as he lived, calm and re&s;igned. As though common mortality mu&s;t not approach de|parting glory, his own <HI>firm hands</HI> performed to him&s;elf the la&s;t &s;ad office of humanity!</P>
