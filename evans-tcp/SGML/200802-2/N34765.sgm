<Q><HI>Train up a Child in the Way he &s;hould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE right education of children is a matter of great importance, and has been viewed in this light by wi&s;e men in all generations. No creatures come into the world in a more needy and helple&s;s condition, as to the body, than mankind; being naked and feeble, they re|quire much care and nur&s;ing before they are able to help them&s;elves: and they equally &s;tand in need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance as to their minds, which are void of knowledge and wi&s;dom, and (which renders their condition more piteous) naturally inclined to im|bibe error rather than truth, and to prefer the paths of vanity, folly and &s;in to the ways of virtue, wi&s;|dom and religion. It is written, Job xi. 12. "Man is born like the wild a&s;s's colt," which is a lively &s;imilitude of ignorant and depraved mankind, for
<PB N="6" REF="045482_0004_101FFED0638379F8">
an a&s;s is a &s;illy, ignorant creature, even to a pro|verb: and a wild a&s;s has &s;omething in him where|by he more fully re&s;embles fallen man; this crea|ture is noted in &s;cripture for wantonne&s;s, Jer. ii. 23. and al&s;o for &s;tubbornne&s;s and an ungovernable di&s;po&s;ition. Job xxxix. 5. "Who hath &s;ent out the wild a&s;s free, or who hath loo&s;ed the bands of the wild a&s;s? who&s;e hou&s;e I have made the wil|derne&s;s, and the barren land his dwellings. He &s;corneth the multitude of the city, neither regard|eth he the crying of the driver." <Q>The hor&s;e mu&s;t travel and the ox draw the plough; the one has a bit put into his mouth, and the other is under a yoke: but a wild a&s;s is a &s;tranger to di&s;cipline, and likes not to hear of any ma&s;ter but him&s;elf, or to be a &s;ervant to any but his own will. Such is the nature of man, he loves to be free, or ra|ther to be di&s;&s;olute. He cannot endure to be &s;ubdued to order; he would know no law but his own lu&s;t, nor rule but his own de&s;ire. He is &s;o much for &s;inful liberty, he cares not for true liberty. The liberty he &s;eeks makes him a bond-&s;lave to corruption.</Q> Thus man is born like the wild a&s;s's colt, ignorant, wanton and licen|tious. And as he is thus born, &s;o, without right education, he is in danger of growing up wild, rude, and de&s;titute of profitable knowledge and true wi&s;dom. As uncultivated land brings forth briars and thorns, &s;o, in untutored and unin&s;tructed minds, odious and hurtful lu&s;ts grow up, nume|rous and &s;trong, which, in their operation, render the &s;ubjects them&s;elves unhappy, and often di&s;quiet all around them, or with whom they are concern|ed,
<PB N="7" REF="045482_0005_101FFED2C8FA7640">
Tho&s;e who have had no good education are liable to become the &s;laves of every lawle&s;s appe|tite and pa&s;&s;ion, to be led a&s;tray by every tempta|tion to evil, to take wrong methods to procure the &s;upports of the pre&s;ent life, and to walk in the broad road which leads to ruin hereafter. And hence appears the importance of right education, with re&s;pect to the intere&s;t of children them&s;elves, that they may be pre&s;erved from &s;uch evils as have been mentioned, and be led in the way which leads to virtue and wi&s;dom, peace and comfort here, and to glory, honour and immortality here|after. It is of importance al&s;o with re&s;pect to civil &s;ociety, that this may be &s;upported, and the bene|fits and ble&s;&s;ings which re&s;ult from thence enjoy|ed. It is of importance with re&s;pect to the church of Chri&s;t, that this may be pre&s;erved on earth, and true religion maintained in the world. In a word, the intere&s;t not only of the pre&s;ent, but of future generations, is deeply concerned in this matter. It has therefore been ju&s;tly accounted a wi&s;e act in parents and others to pay a particular attention hereunto, and to &s;pare no &s;uitable pains and co&s;t in having the ri&s;ing generation well in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>To this end we have the injunction in the text, from a wi&s;e king, under the influence of divine in|&s;piration, to "train up a child in the way he &s;hould go;" which implies, that there is a wrong way, in which children ought not to go, and for prevent|ing of which, right education is nece&s;&s;ary, and al&s;o a right way, in which they ought to walk, and to which a good education mu&s;t point and introduce them; and for our encouragement to the practice

the paths of vanity and folly. They have not only the light of con&s;cience, but the light of education, to conflict with; and many a &s;truggle they mu&s;t have in their own minds, and many upbraidings of con&s;cience, before they can ea&s;ily go contrary to all the wi&s;e in&s;tructions that have been given them, and addict them&s;elves to vicious cour&s;es. (3.) If they do depart for awhile, there is great hope that they will &s;ee their error, and be reclaim|ed. Even the great and wi&s;e King Solomon, the author of this book of Proverbs, turned a&s;ide, for a time, from the right way, but was brought to true repentance and reformation, as is evident from the book of Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, which, it is highly pro|bable, he wrote in his old age, and which contains a publick te&s;timony of his repentance and abhor|rence of all tho&s;e &s;inful cour&s;es to which he had been addicted. So that when it is &s;aid in the text, that tho&s;e who are trained up in the way wherein they &s;hould go, will not depart from it in after years, we may under&s;tand, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill not ea&s;ily and ordinarily depart from it, or if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ey do &s;o for a time, yet that there is great rea&s;on to hope they will be happily recovered. There are no general rules without exceptions; and though upon &s;ome, all care and pains prove but lo&s;t labour, yet, as to many others, it is otherwi&s;e. And if the labour is lo&s;t as to the youth them&s;elves, yet tho&s;e, to who&s;e care and in&s;truction they have been committed, will have the &s;atisfaction of having di&s;charged their duty, though they have not attained the end they de&s;ired.</P>

<P>Thus have I endeavoured to give &s;ome outlines of a good education of children, both at home and at &s;chool. Let us now, by way of improvement, make &s;ome reflections on what has been offered.</P>
<P N="1">1. Hence we may &s;ee, that parents and others are well employed, when they are doing what is in their power, that their children, and others under their care, may be well in&s;tructed, that, if their lives are &s;pared, they may fear the Lord, and be u&s;eful members of &s;ociety in thier generation; and if they are taken away while young, that they may be ble&s;&s;ed hereafter. If any think the time and nece&s;&s;ary expen&s;e be&s;towed this way is to little or no purpo&s;e, it is becau&s;e they do not rightly con|&s;ider the benefits of a good education. Certainly it is to the commendation and prai&s;e of any peo|ple, when they are careful to in&s;titute and &s;upport good &s;chools, at &s;uitable di&s;tances from each other, for the in&s;truction and right education of children. In this re&s;pect, perhaps the endeavours of the in|habitants of this town are equal, according to their numbers and ability, to tho&s;e of any other people in the&s;e parts. We have a number of &s;chool-hou&s;es, in different parts of the town, which are &s;ome|times all at once in u&s;e. We are now wor&s;hipping in a new and elegant one, erected for the &s;ame no|ble purpo&s;e.
