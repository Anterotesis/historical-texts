<P><HI>THE</HI> lives of good or eminent per&s;ons, have always been thought a very u&s;e|ful &s;tudy, as they &s;et before us examples which may incite us to virtue, and trace out to us a path, wherein emulation may induce us to walk. But the Author of this little Hi&s;tory, which is founded on fact pre&s;umes, that the life of a man, more than ordinarily good, who&s;e &s;tation and opportunies of act|ing are on a level with a great part of mankind, might afford a more u&s;eful le&s;&s;on than the lives of his &s;uperiors, as being more within the reach of imitation.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF SIR GEORGE ELLISON.</HEAD>
<P>SIR George Elli&s;on's father was the younger &s;on of an ancient and opu|lent family, and as &s;uch received only a &s;mall proportion of his father's wealth, but by his profe&s;&s;ion was enabled to live genteely. He dedicated all his lei&s;ure hours to the care of
<PB N="4" REF="042696_0004_101C880C0E699B10">his children's education: Their learning he left to proper ma&s;ters; the object of his at|tention was their hearts. He in&s;tructed them fully in the Chri&s;tian religion, and &s;hewed them that it was the be&s;t foundation, as well as &s;ure&s;t &s;upport of moral virtue.</P>
<P>Before his &s;on George had completed his one and twentieth year, his family, by the death of his wife and two children, was re|duced to two &s;ons and one daughter. James his &s;econd &s;on, was then but twelve, and his daughter fourteen years old. This difference in their ages determined Mr. Elli&s;on to tru&s;t in his &s;on George's hands two thirds of the &s;um of 4000l. of which he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. By &s;o good a capital he hoped to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;s of his elde&s;t &s;on, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition gave him rea&s;on to believe he &s;hould thereby do the be&s;t &s;ervice to his other children. He knew the young man to be perfectly &s;ober, humane, and generous, and at the &s;ame time an exceeding good oeconomi&s;t extremely di|ligent, and well inclined to that care of, and attention to his affairs, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="042696_0005_101C88565CD10F58">who undertake merchandi&s;e. And indeed, George, as he entered into merchandi&s;e, he wi&s;hed to pur&s;ue it in the mo&s;t profitable manner, indifferent as to any inconveniencies which might attend it. He therefore endea|voured to &s;ettle corre&s;pondences with &s;ome of the le&s;s adventurous merchants, by who&s;e means he might negotiate a quick trade from Jamaica, where he intended to fix; and the character he had e&s;tabli&s;hed in the city, by his excellent behaviour during his apprentice|&s;hip with Mr. Lamont, an eminent merch|ant, rendered him &s;ucce&s;sful in both the&s;e articles; and with warm hopes, though ten|der concern, he took leave of his father and this kingdom, well provided with corre&s;pond|ents here, and recommendations to the prin|cipal people in Jamaica.</P>
<P>Five years after his fir&s;t &s;ettling at Jamaica, he acquainted his father with his re&s;olution of returning the whole capital he &s;et out with, ob&s;erving the hazard his brother and &s;i&s;ter ran by his being intru&s;ted with the whole; but, that his father might not apprehend he
<PB N="6" REF="042696_0006_101C88101EF212C8">was di&s;tre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, he further informed him that he had now rai&s;ed a capital of 6000l. to which he &s;hould always think he had as good a title as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>If Mr. Elli&s;on's good conduct gained him the e&s;teem of his own &s;ex, we may ea&s;ily &s;up|po&s;e the other was not in&s;en&s;ible of his merit; e&s;pecially as it was accompanied by a very fine per&s;on, a face hand&s;ome from great &s;ymme|try of features, but &s;till more from vivacity, &s;en&s;ibility, and &s;weetne&s;s of countenance; a manner and addre&s;s polite and engaging, and a turn for conver&s;ation peculiarly agreeable. As the manners of Jamaica are not peculiarly re&s;erved, many intimations were given to him of the favourable di&s;po&s;ition of the Ladies; but his attention was &s;o totally engaged by his bu&s;ine&s;s, that the &s;tronge&s;t hints were lo&s;t up|on him; Yet the politene&s;s of his behaviour, and the chearfulne&s;s of his temper, &s;o well concealed the coldne&s;s of his heart, that to warm it &s;eemed no impracticable attempt; and prudence, as well as inclination, might di&s;po&s;e many to endeavour to gain the affecti|ons
<PB N="7" REF="042696_0007_101C8859613E6040">of &s;o worthy and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful a young man. No woman had the mortification of thinking &s;he had a rival, till a widow Lady entered the li&s;ts.</P>
<P>This Lady was &s;even years older than Mr. Elli&s;on, having completed her three and thir|tieth year. Though the bloom of youth was pa&s;t, &s;he was &s;till hand&s;ome, and behaved very prudently in the different &s;tates of life in which &s;he had appeared; was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ten thou&s;and pounds in money, and a plantation of no le&s;s value. Mr. Elli&s;on's friends per|&s;uaded him not to let &s;lip &s;o good an oppor|tunity of improving his fortune; &s;ince, with|out tho&s;e advantages, her character and per|&s;on rendered it an eligible match. He li&s;ten|ed, without reluctance, to the advice of his friends, but, being &s;en&s;ible he &s;hould feel double &s;atisfaction if he had his father's &s;anc|tion, he would not make any direct addre&s;s to the Lady, till he had received that nece&s;|&s;ary con&s;ent. His father took the fir&s;t op|portunity of removing this impediment, &s;end|ing not only his con&s;ent but his approbation,
<PB N="8" REF="042696_0008_101C8812F6ACE708">accompanied with the warme&s;t wi&s;hes for his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on, who&s;e inclination for the La|dy had increa&s;ed with acquaintance, received his father's letter with joy; and, now mak|ing an expre&s;s declaration of his attachment, the widow, without affected reluctance, ac|cepted his propo&s;al, and the marriage was &s;oon completed.</P>
<P>By the alteration of his fortune, Mr. Elli|&s;on found his &s;phere of action extended; but (as is frequently the ca&s;e) this gave him great unea&s;ine&s;s. The thing which had chiefly hurt him during his abode in Jamaica, was the cruelty u&s;ed on one part of mankind, as if the difference of complexion excluded them from the human race. He had not been married above a week before he gave great offence to his wife and &s;teward, by putting a &s;top to a mo&s;t &s;evere puni&s;hment, ju&s;t be|ginning to be inflicted on a great number of them, who, intoxicated with the plea&s;ures of a holy-day, had not returned home at the
<PB N="9" REF="042696_0009_101C885AE7C76538">time commanded. 'I am, &s;aid he, deter|mined, henceforward, to ea&s;e your &s;teward of this part of his bu&s;ine&s;s; the produce of the land he may &s;till attend, but tho&s;e who cultivate it &s;hall be my care; he is not fit to be tru&s;ted with any thing but what is inani|mate. And that you may not think I pay too high a price for this indulgence of my compa&s;&s;ion, or rather this compliance with my con&s;cience, I will endeavour to find a means of rendering our &s;laves obedient, with|out violating the laws of ju&s;tice and humanity.'</P>
<P>Mrs. Elli&s;on was mortified to find her hu&s;|band incorrigible in &s;o material an article, fearing lea&s;t her fortune &s;hould &s;uffer thro' his &s;implicity; but humanity, when &s;ufficient|ly warm and &s;teady, &s;eldom waits long for the power and opportunity of exertion. He &s;oon formed a plan, and &s;et about the execution of it with the utmo&s;t diligence. Afterwards haranguing his &s;laves, 'While you perform your duty, &s;aid he, I &s;hall look upon you as free &s;ervants, or rather like my children, for who&s;e well-being I am ever anxious and
<PB N="10" REF="042696_0010_101C8815BA34C990">watchful. I have provided you with conve|nient habitations; given you a plentiful por|tion of all nece&s;&s;aries; a&s;&s;igned to each a &s;mall &s;hare of peculiar property; taken care of you in &s;ickne&s;s; and con&s;idered your ea&s;e in health; I have increa&s;ed your liberty; pro|moted your amu&s;ements; and much lighten|ed your puni&s;hments. But &s;till the&s;e are too heavy; I cannot feel my&s;elf &s;o &s;uperior to any of my fellow-creatures, as to have a right of correcting them &s;everely. I am determined therefore, for the future, to aboli&s;h all cor|poral puni&s;hments. I &s;hall require nothing of you that can be properly thought a hard|&s;hip; but, if gratitude and prudence can|not bind you to good behaviour, the fir&s;t offence &s;hall be puni&s;hed by excluding you from partaking of the next weekly holy-days; for the &s;econd fault you &s;hall not only be de|prived of your diver&s;ion, but of a day's food; and, if the&s;e gentle corrections do not re|form you, on the third offence you &s;hall be &s;old to the fir&s;t purcha&s;er, however low the price offered; and this &s;entence is irrever&s;i|ble; no prayers, no intreaties, &s;hall move me.
<PB N="11" REF="042696_0011_101C885EF86FD488">The man who, after &s;o happy a change to his condition, can repeatedly offend, is not worthy to be the object of my care; and &s;hall become the property of &s;ome ma&s;ter, who&s;e cha&s;ti&s;ements may keep within the bounds of duty the actions of that man, who&s;e heart cannot be influenced by grati|tude, or his own true intere&s;t.'</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on's humanity had already gain|ed the affections of his &s;laves, but on this declaration they almo&s;t adored him, and in the &s;tronge&s;t terms promi&s;ed him, and them|&s;elves likewi&s;e, never to offend &s;o good a ma&s;ter, in &s;uch a manner as to bring them under the heavy &s;entence he had pronounced again&s;t tho&s;e who per&s;evered in di&s;obedience. This was at that time the real &s;entiments of their hearts, but human frailty had left &s;carcely the re&s;olution of one unbroken; yet few of them were &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s as to incur the third puni&s;hment. The fir&s;t who was &s;o un|fortunate, when he found that the &s;entence was going to be put in execution, was almo&s;t di&s;tracted, and was with difficulty re&s;trained
<PB N="12" REF="042696_0012_101C881743DA1198">from doing violence on him&s;elf. His impor|tunate intreaties for pardon extremely di&s;tre&s;s|ed Mr. Elli&s;on. To deny the poor wretch a farther trial grieved him to the &s;oul; and yet he &s;aw that a &s;trict adherence to his fir&s;t declaration was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; he there|fore re&s;olved to endure the conflict, though not unmoved, yet with unaltered purpo&s;e; and to &s;hew them that, in de&s;pight of his compa&s;&s;ion, which was too great to be con|cealed, he was &s;till inflexible.</P>
<P>Mrs. Elli&s;on, who met him as he returned from this unhappy wretch, was amazed at his unea&s;ine&s;s. 'Surely, &s;aid &s;he, you have no &s;pirit, if you can pity &s;uch an ungrateful creature. I hope you are &s;en&s;ible it is a great weakne&s;s to be &s;o tamely forgiving.' 'How <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I think &s;o, replied Mr. Elli&s;on, when I &s;ee &s;uch various proofs that the Be|ing, in whom there is no weakne&s;s, who is all perfection, is far more forgiving than any of his creatures? He is love and mercy it&s;elf; can then any portion of the divine nature, that part of his image which he &s;tamped on
<PB N="13" REF="042696_0013_101C8861C91D6F60">man, be e&s;teemed a failing! How much more di&s;obedient are the be&s;t of us to him, than our &s;laves are to us? Yet he does not cru&s;h us with his power; he neither &s;ends the lightnings to bla&s;t the offender, nor pe&s;ti|lence to con&s;ume a &s;inful country; he bears with us year after year, gives us frequent calls and admonitions to repentance, and leaves us a long &s;ea&s;on for amendment.'</P>
<P>As Mrs. Elli&s;on was not deficient in un|der&s;tanding, &s;he &s;aw there was &s;ome truth in what her hu&s;band had &s;aid; but it was a truth her rea&s;on could more ea&s;ily perceive, than her heart feel, for it was &s;teeled by habit.</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on, &s;oon after his marriage, had de&s;ired his father to &s;end him over a proper per&s;on to teach reading, writing, and ac|compts; leaving him at liberty as to the &s;ti|pend, only de&s;iring that the man might be &s;ober and virtuous. As &s;oon as this per&s;on arrived, he gave him a neat hou&s;e and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed him &s;choolma&s;ter, &s;ending all the
<PB N="14" REF="042696_0014_101C881B76656A40">children of his Negroe &s;laves to be under his tuition. He cau&s;ed them to be in&s;tructed in the principles of the Chri&s;tian religion, hop|ing thereby to civili&s;e their manners, and rectify their di&s;po&s;itions. This office he per|formed him&s;elf to tho&s;e more advanced in years, believing in&s;truction would come with more authority and per&s;ua&s;ion from him, as they re&s;pected him as their ma&s;ter, and loved him for the happine&s;s they enjoyed in his &s;ervice; and certainly &s;uch doctrine can &s;carcely fail of proving per&s;ua&s;ive, when the preacher's actions are &s;o eminently conform|able to his precepts.</P>
<P>By plentiful food and a comfortable life, Mr. Elli&s;on's Negroes became &s;tronger than any in the i&s;land; the natural &s;trength of tho&s;e who belonged to other ma&s;ters being con&s;umed by hard&s;hips and hunger. His were therefore able, with ea&s;e, to do &s;o much more work, that he might have dimini&s;hed their number, if compa&s;&s;ion had not prevent|ed him. He had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing his conduct &s;ucceed to his utmo&s;t wi&s;h. Ne|groes
<PB N="15" REF="042696_0015_101C88649359A4D0">are naturally faithful and affectionate, though, on great provocation, their re&s;ent|ment is unbounded, and they will indulge their revenge, though to their own certain de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Above a year pa&s;&s;ed away without his be|ing obliged to &s;ell another &s;lave; which gave him hopes he &s;hould never again be expo&s;ed to &s;o painful an exertion of his power. And the poor wretch, who&s;e example had &s;o good an effect on his companions, had all that time &s;uffered the u&s;ual &s;everities under a hard ma&s;ter. His &s;elf-reproaches made him dou|bly wretched, and, as he lived in a plantation adjacent to Mr. Elli&s;on's, he was a con&s;tant object of compa&s;&s;ion to his former compani|ons, who frequently lamented his fate, and repre&s;ented his di&s;tre&s;s with &s;uch pathetic &s;im|plicity, as touched Mr. Elli&s;on's compa&s;&s;ion|ate heart to &s;o great a degree, that he re&s;olv|ed to re-purcha&s;e him at any price. This he effected on more rea&s;onable terms than he hoped, for the poor fellow's dejection of &s;pi|rits was &s;uch, that it undermined his health,
<PB N="16" REF="042696_0016_101C881E9926A8E0">and rendered him &s;o weak, that his ma&s;ter was very glad to get the price he had given for him. When he was acquainted with his being again become Mr. Elli&s;on's property, his joy was near proving fatal, having entire|ly overpowered his &s;pirits. A holy-day was given to all the &s;laves to welcome his return, and never was the re&s;toration of a Monarch celebrated with &s;o much heart-felt, di&s;inte|re&s;ted joy.</P>
<P>But, although the gratitude and a&s;&s;iduity of this poor fellow's future behaviour greatly rewarded his ma&s;ter, yet it produced a di&s;a|greeable event; another &s;lave was encou|raged by it to flatter him&s;elf that Mr. Elli&s;on would never again exerci&s;e the &s;ame &s;everity, &s;ince it had proved &s;o painful to him; but above all, not on one, who was particularly intelligent and u&s;eful, as this &s;lave knew him|&s;elf to be. On this &s;uppo&s;ition, he extended his offence to a third time, but was dreadful|ly &s;urpri&s;ed to find him&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding his mo&s;t earne&s;t intreaties, doomed to be &s;old. Before the day appointed for the &s;ale
<PB N="17" REF="042696_0017_101C88661A01CA88">of the offender arrived, he was &s;eized with a violent fever, and his malady &s;o increa&s;ed as to render his recovery doubtful, and he was de&s;irous not to recover. Preferring death to &s;lavery under another ma&s;ter, he refu&s;ed to take the remedies pre&s;cribed, and earne&s;tly begged he might be &s;uffered to die. Mr. Elli&s;on thought his condition would &s;uffici|ently excu&s;e the rever&s;ing of his &s;entence; &s;o that the poor man now became as anxious to pre&s;erve, as he had been before de&s;irous of lo&s;ing his life; and, his mind being at ea&s;e, he recovered from his fever and his perver&s;e|ne&s;s together.</P>
<P>Mrs. Elli&s;on, before the expiration of the fir&s;t year of their marriage, brought him a very fine boy. Her fortune enabled him to ex|tend his trade; and his &s;ucce&s;s therein always an&s;wered his wi&s;hes. But he was not free from vexations; Mrs. Elli&s;on, though a good &s;ort of a woman, was one of tho&s;e who make bad companions in intimate &s;ociety. She was &s;o very fond of her hu&s;band, that &s;he was mi|&s;erable if he was out of her &s;ight. If, when
<PB N="18" REF="042696_0018_101C88215ED1C158">abroad on bu&s;ine&s;s, he did not return ju&s;t at the hour &s;he expected, he found her in ago|nies, le&s;t &s;ome misfortune had befallen him; and, with floods of tears, &s;he reproached him with in&s;en&s;ibility of the pain &s;he &s;uffered, from his want of punctuality. If he expre&s;&s;ed an in|clination to &s;pend an evening with a friend, &s;he was incon&s;olable, and lamented his indifference If he paid the common attentions which po|litene&s;s required for any other woman, &s;he was fired with jealou&s;y. When any generous action of his reached her ears, which could not but happen frequently, &s;he would mo&s;t pathetically lament that, 'notwith&s;tanding the fine fortune &s;he brought, her dear boy would be a beggar,' and upon all emergen|cies &s;he would &s;ay, that her fir&s;t hu&s;band would not have u&s;ed her &s;o. Had Mrs. El|li&s;on openly &s;hewed an intention of en&s;laving her hu&s;band, &s;he would have found him bet|ter acquainted with the relative duties of ma|trimony, than to have &s;ubmitted to a di&s;|graceful and unnatural yoke. But, when they were fir&s;t married, &s;he re&s;trained only with &s;ilken threads; the fetters were forged
<PB N="19" REF="042696_0019_101C886A34412E98">by degrees. By the little endearments of ex|ce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s, &s;he would bring him to compliance, when he rai&s;ed objections from convenience, or politene&s;s; and unwilling to appear in&s;en&s;ible of &s;o much tenderne&s;s, he would &s;ometimes delay bu&s;ine&s;s, and break appointments. Every compliance of this &s;ort rendered her applications more frequent, and if he &s;hewed much reluctance, plaintive, af|fectionate reproaches of want of love, &s;trength|ened the reque&s;t. Every conque&s;t more ful|ly convinced her of his weakne&s;s; &s;he per|ceived that his greate&s;t fear was to give pain; that he could not bear without &s;evere pangs, to be the cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s to any per&s;on; but, above all, to one who was rendered &s;u&s;|ceptible of it, chiefly by her love for him.</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on, however, at length &s;aw rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect there was more of policy than love in her behaviour; but, before he conceived this &s;u&s;picion, &s;he had brought him to a habit of compliance, which he could not &s;hake oft without a &s;tronger effort than the gentlene&s;s of his nature would &s;uffer him to exert.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="042696_0020_101C8824208228A8">But, if he &s;tood ju&s;tified to him&s;elf, his friends pa&s;&s;ed a le&s;s favourable &s;entence. They found them&s;elves deprived of the mo&s;t agree|able &s;ociety the place afforded, and were not a little angry with the occa&s;ion of it. Some, &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;en&s;ibly, advi&s;ed him to free him&s;elf from his bondage: Others laughed at him for his pu&s;illanimity. A &s;ecret con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that the advice was good, and the ridicule ju&s;t, made him receive both with great good humour, but they were equally ineffectual; he eluded them in the be&s;t man|ner he could, telling the fir&s;t, that 'to throw off the re&s;traint would give him more trouble than he found in &s;ubmitting to it;' and to the je&s;ters he only &s;aid 'they mu&s;t not wonder if his long application to mer|chandize had taught him to &s;ee every thing in the light of traffic; and his wife had bought him at &s;o great a price, that he tho't &s;he had a right to make the be&s;t of the pur|cha&s;e.'

The child was naturally of a pa&s;&s;ionate and &s;tubborn temper, which his father &s;aw with concern, and thought it his duty to keep him within rea&s;onable controul; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to conquer faults, which, when &s;trengthened by time and habit, mu&s;t prove incorrigible. Mrs. Elli&s;on, on the contrary, called his pa&s;|&s;ion &s;pirit, and his &s;tubbornne&s;s con&s;tancy and &s;teadine&s;s, and could not bear he &s;hould re|ceive the lea&s;t contradiction. She was con|tinually puffing him up with the notion of his con&s;equence, repre&s;enting all the people about him as his &s;laves, and making them &s;eek to plea&s;e him by the mo&s;t abject means. She taught him to look on them in the &s;ame light as &s;he her&s;elf did, as creatures de&s;titute of all natural rights, of &s;en&s;e and feeling. She was plea&s;ed to &s;ee him vent his childi&s;h pa&s;&s;i|ons upon them, and was always ready to gra|tify his re&s;entments beyond his wi&s;h; and &s;o

Mr. Elli&s;on &s;aw all this with a very &s;en&s;ible concern; he en|deavoured to teach his wife the duty of a pa|rent, and to convince her that her indulg|ence rendered her the child's mo&s;t pernicious enemy; but, having never rea&s;oned in her life, the faculty was too feeble to enter into the force of his arguments; &s;he was too per|ver&s;e to attend, and too weak to be convinced.</P>
<P>He then a&s;&s;umed an air to which &s;he had hitherto been a &s;tranger, and told her, 'though he had &s;acrificed his own inclinati|ons to her, &s;he mu&s;t not expect to find the &s;ame ea&s;y temper in him when the welfare of his &s;on was at &s;take;' and in the mo&s;t re&s;o|lute manner declared, he would not &s;uffer him to be made a brute. Tears were now called to her aid; &s;he wept for his cruelty, and lamented the hatred he bore both to her and her child. But all the&s;e arts proved now unavailing; Mr. Elli&s;on's heart was too deep|ly

To be &s;uperiorly beloved was &s;o great a gratification to Mrs. Elli&s;on's nar|row and ungenerous mind, that &s;he rejoiced in every &s;ymptom of his di&s;like to his father, though beloved by her as much as was con|&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch &s;elfi&s;h principles as her's.</P>

<P>Mr. Elli&s;on was convinced of what con|cern and great importance to its future hap|pine&s;s and welfare depended on the education of his child. He was &s;o convinced of the

He knew that the evil habits imbibed at his &s;on's age, took too deep a root, and if not checked in time, were &s;el|dom to be conquered, either by religion, rea|&s;on or per&s;ua&s;ion. He had too fatal an in|&s;tance of it in Mrs. Elli&s;on; educated in the i&s;lands, &s;he was familiari&s;ed to cruelty and hardened to any idea of &s;en&s;ibility&mdash;&s;he could laugh at the &s;ufferings of the poor blacks, and would frequently reproach Mr. Elli&s;on for his humanity towards them. Such al&s;o, were the principles &s;he would have in&s;tilled into her child. But Mr. Elli&s;on's foreca&s;t of the natural con&s;equences of this, and how unhappy it mu&s;t in future render, not only his child, but all tho&s;e with whom he might be connected, and more particularly tho&s;e under his immediate protection and care, put him on his guard to prevent it.</P>

<P>To remove her objections, he therefore propo&s;ed their following the child into Eng|land, as &s;oon as they could &s;ettle their affairs in &s;uch a manner, as might enable them to bid a long adieu to Jamaica, without great detriment; but this admini&s;tered little con&s;o|lation to Mrs. Elli&s;on, as &s;he had conceived

<P>The mo&s;t difficult part of his bu&s;ine&s;s was to get a &s;teward, who would treat his &s;laves with the &s;ame gentlene&s;s to which he had ac|cu&s;tomed them; and he had nearly &s;ettled his commercial affairs, before he &s;aw any pro|bability of finding a per&s;on fit for that impor|tant office.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t rumour of his intended departure cau&s;ed the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation among the&s;e poor creatures; they gathered round him, and falling on their knees, in their imperfect Engli&s;h, cried out, 'Oh! ma&s;&s;a, no go, no go; if go, &s;teward whip, beat, kill poor &s;lave; no go, no go; you go we die.'</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="042696_0028_101C88320B364128">He a&s;&s;ured them, that he looked upon them all as his children, and promi&s;ed no one &s;hould &s;upply his place, that did not con&s;ider him&s;elf as their father. In&s;tead of being &s;atisfied with this promi&s;e, they ex|claimed, 'all fathers not good; no father like you;' and &s;uch torrents of tears would accompany their words, as frequently &s;tag|gered his re&s;olution.

<P>Bu&s;ine&s;s having called Mr. Elli&s;on to Port-Royal, he there heard lamented, the misfor|tunes of Mr. Hammond, an Engli&s;h gentle|man, who had been e&s;tabli&s;hed there above two years as a merchant in good credit. Mr. Hammond had ju&s;t received a 1000 l. in re|turn for &s;ome commodities he had exported;
<PB N="29" REF="042696_0029_101C8875B9E6E040">and this &s;um he in&s;i&s;ted on an un&s;ucce&s;sful friend's taking for a time, in hopes it might enable him to &s;ave his credit, and carry on his trade till affairs took a more favourable turn.</P>
<P>By this well-timed loan, the poor man and his family were &s;aved from de&s;truction; but lo&s;&s;es by &s;hipwreck, and other accidents, hav|ing &s;ucce&s;&s;ively fallen on Mr. Hammond, he &s;aw him&s;elf reduced into the &s;ituation from which he had relieved his friend; with only this difference, that his was a &s;ingle di&s;tre&s;s; whereas a wife, and nine children, would have been &s;harers in the misfortunes of the other. All Mr. Hammond's effects were &s;eized, but proved in&s;ufficient to di&s;charge his debts. The creditors knew he had lent &s;ome money, but were ignorant as to the ex|act &s;um: This they pre&s;&s;ed him to call in; promi&s;ing, on the receipt of it, to di&s;charge him from pri&s;on, even if it did not quite a|mount to what was due to them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="042696_0030_101C8834DE778F80">Mr. Hammond could not &s;upport the thought of purcha&s;ing his liberty by reducing &s;o large a family to beggary; but, as he was &s;en&s;ible his creditors had a ju&s;t right to all his pro|perty, he offered to enter into the mo&s;t bind|ing engagements to give up the &s;um to them, as &s;oon as his friend could refund it without ruin; and to make him pay them the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed intere&s;t till that time; but, enraged at this delay, they refu&s;ed to accept his offer, and declared he &s;hould remain their pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>This &s;tory very much affected Mr. Elli&s;on's compa&s;&s;ionate heart; and in hopes of find|ing &s;ome method of relieving the di&s;tre&s;s of &s;o worthy a man, he went the next day to the pri&s;on to vi&s;it him; and having under|taken to do his utmo&s;t, to bring the credit|ors to agree to what he had offered, he ne|gociated the affair with great a&s;&s;iduity, but little &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of this tran&s;action, hav|ing had many proofs of Mr. Hammond's in|tegrity and humanity, he acquainted him
<PB N="31" REF="042696_0031_101C887751DF3DB8">with his re&s;olution of advancing the thou|&s;and pounds lent to his friend, and becoming him&s;elf that Gentleman's creditor; a&s;&s;uring Mr. Hammond that he &s;hould never a&s;k for the payment, but &s;uffer his friend to &s;uit his own convenience in that re&s;pect.</P>
<P>He then told Mr. Hammond, that he was &s;en&s;ible, though by this &s;tep he might deliver him from pri&s;on, yet he &s;hould not &s;ecure him from di&s;tre&s;s; he therefore begged leave to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in any cour&s;e of life wherein he thought proper to engage; adding, that he could not but wi&s;h he might accept the offer he now made him of taking upon him&s;elf the direction of his plantation and &s;laves, as he delayed his removal into England only till he could find a fit per&s;on for his &s;teward.</P>
<P>Mr. Hammond's heart overflowed with gratitude, as well for the transfer of the debt of the thou&s;and pounds, as for the kind of|fer he made him. The care of the land, he &s;aid, would give him plea&s;ure, and he be|lieved he might acquit him&s;elf tolerably well
<PB N="32" REF="042696_0032_101C8837A0BCFB40">in it, but he knew him&s;elf totally unfit for the government of &s;laves, the &s;everities re|qui&s;ite to keep them in order being &s;uch, as he was not only incapable of decreeing, but even of beholding.</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on, delighted with the &s;entiments he had expre&s;&s;ed, as they confirmed him in that opinion of his di&s;po&s;ition, which had fir&s;t in&s;pired him with the de&s;ire of leaving him his deputy when he &s;hould depart the i&s;land, told him, that the difficulties he had been under in finding a &s;teward, were occa&s;ioned by the fears of having his &s;laves ill treated, who had always been u&s;ed by him more like children than &s;ervants, and had convinced him by their behaviour, that &s;everity was not only unnece&s;&s;ary, but hurtful. He de|&s;ired Mr. Hammond therefore, if he had no other objection to the &s;teward&s;hip, to go home with him, and after &s;ufficient ob&s;erva|tion to give him his an&s;wer.</P>

<P>"O Humanity!&mdash;Heaven-born principle! &mdash;true and never cea&s;ing &s;ource of bli&s;s&mdash;hap|py tho&s;e, who&s;e hearts are warmed with thy &s;weet and benign influence!

<P>Thrice happy that man, who&s;e &s;oul, im|pre&s;&s;ed with the true principles of real and pious &s;en&s;ibility, looks up to Heaven for an example for his conduct and behaviour in life. If ble&s;&s;ed with affluence, his chief bli&s;s is to make others happy, and every time he relieves an object from di&s;tre&s;s, he feels a joy unutterable;&mdash;words want the pow|er, and language the expre&s;&s;ion, to declare the delightful &s;atisfaction he feels: Or in|deed, &s;uppo&s;ing poverty his lot, and, that he has but little, yet, of that will he admi|ni&s;ter relief, and find more comfort and real &s;atisfaction, than the mi&s;er in his hoard or the &s;pend thrift in his plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>With all his affluence, is it likely that Mr. Elli&s;on, without that &s;weet and heavenly &s;en|&s;ibility
<PB N="35" REF="042696_0035_101C887E1A8B8070">that fired his &s;oul, would have enjoyed any degree of the happine&s;s he did? Is it not through all his actions the chief in&s;trument of his bli&s;s, leading him, as it were, &s;tep by &s;tep, to the &s;ummit of human perfection?</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on now &s;aw the liberty of depart|ing from Jamaica approach. His mercantile affairs were the more ea&s;ily &s;ettled by his bro|ther's arrival in the i&s;land; for, as &s;oon as he had determined on his return to England, he wrote to his father to &s;end over his bro|ther James, who had been likewi&s;e bred to merchandize, as it would be in his power to &s;ettle him very advantageou&s;ly, and to e&s;ta|bli&s;h him immediately in an exten&s;ive trade, by making over his corre&s;pondents to him. He found the young man &s;en&s;ible, hone&s;t, and diligent; and well de&s;erving the en|couragement he de&s;igned to give him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Elli&s;on was indeed le&s;s plea&s;ed with her brother in-law, fearing her hu&s;band might favour him too generou&s;ly.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="042696_0036_101C883D651A5A20">The young man was &s;hocked to &s;ee the ar|bitrary power &s;he exerci&s;ed over her hu&s;band, not immediately di&s;cerning, that there was one thing his brother feared even more than his wife, the reproaches of his own con&s;cience, and though he &s;acrificed mo&s;t worldly things to her caprices, yet there was a Being whom he more carefully endeavoured to plea&s;e than her.</P>
<P>Affairs were in this &s;ituation when Mrs. Elli&s;on was &s;eized with a fever, at that time almo&s;t epidemical. The attack was &s;o vio|lent, as from the fir&s;t gave little hopes of a recovery, and, notwith&s;tanding the be&s;t me|dical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he died in a few days.</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on was &s;incerely afflicted at her death; her faults he had long pitied and now forgot; while her virtues, or &s;uch as he imagined &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, were engraven on his memory.</P>
<P>But his friends, while they endeavoured to con&s;ole him, comforted them&s;elves in be|lieving,
<PB N="37" REF="042696_0037_101C887FA2DC60A0">that though habit and gentlene&s;s of temper may teach a pri&s;oner to hug his chains, yet when taken off, he will &s;oon grow &s;en&s;i|ble he is relieved from a burden, and find the removal of con&s;tant con&s;traint makes him amends for the lo&s;s of many plea&s;ures which accompanied it.</P>
<P>But they had not an opportunity of &s;eeing this &s;uppo&s;ition verified, as Mr. Elli&s;on did not &s;tay long enough in the i&s;land after his wife's death, to wear off the grief he felt on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time, however, he became &s;uf|ficiently him&s;elf to pro&s;ecute his plan for &s;et|ling every thing there to the be&s;t advantage. He found Mr. Hammond even exceed his hopes; he &s;oon gained the affection of the &s;laves; an open, humane, and chearful coun|tenance giving them a prejudice in his fa|vour, which his conduct improved into a ra|tional confidence.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="042696_0038_101C8840272001A8">He al&s;o beheld with delight, the improve|ment the children had received in the &s;chool he had e&s;tabli&s;hed. The ma&s;ter's &s;alary was rai&s;ed, and a young lad left with him of a remarkable good di&s;po&s;ition and under&s;tand|ing, as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, but with a &s;ecret view of qualifying him to &s;ucceed, in ca&s;e the ma&s;ter &s;hould die, or grow weary of the charge.</P>
<P>The &s;choolma&s;ter's &s;i&s;ter, upon invitation, being come over from England, was made mi&s;tre&s;s of a &s;chool of Negroe girls, a charge wherein &s;he acquitted her&s;elf extremely well. The effect of their in&s;tructions was evident in the conduct of the Negroes; for the fe|rocity of their tempers, their ob&s;tinacy, and that re&s;entful turn of mind, &s;eemingly natu|ral to them, were &s;o &s;oftened by religion, that it very &s;eldom happened that any &s;ymp|toms of them appeared.</P>
<P>By this time Mr. Elli&s;on's brother James had entered into a very tender attachment. The youth no &s;ooner became acquainted with
<PB N="39" REF="042696_0039_101C8884100C0C28">Mi&s;s Reynolds, a young lady in the neigh|bourhood, than he felt the influence of her charms; &s;he was not in&s;en&s;ible of the merits of her lover, and they were &s;o well agreed before Mr. Elli&s;on's departure, that James thought it proper to inform his brother of his inclination.</P>
<P>A long acquaintance with Mi&s;s Reynolds had afforded him a good opportunity to di&s;|cern her merit; his brother could not have cho&s;en a woman he &s;o much e&s;teemed; her fortune, though not con&s;iderable, was &s;uffi|cient to be of &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance in trade, and her prudence and oeconomy were well &s;uited to his &s;ituation. He therefore very &s;incere|ly gave his approbation, had the marriage celebrated with great elegance in his own hou&s;e, and made a pre&s;ent to the bride of all the jewels that belonged to his decea&s;ed wife. To his brother he gave a hou&s;e he had at King&s;town, with all his plate and li|nen, and the free u&s;e of all his furniture; and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Hammond he allowed 200 l. per
<PB N="40" REF="042696_0040_101C8842F3F861E0">annum, with the liberty of living in his hou&s;e, and many other privileges.</P>
<P>Having thus intirely &s;ettled, his affairs, he &s;et &s;ail for England, leaving his friends and dependants mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly afflicted, and &s;har|ing in their grief, though the de&s;ire of re|turning to his native country, of &s;eeing his father and his child, and of repairing a con|&s;titution much hurt by the heat of the cli|mate, made the change on the whole very de&s;irable to him.</P>
<P>His voyage was &s;wift and pro&s;perous; and no dangers called off his thoughts from the plea&s;ure he felt in anticipating, in imagina|tion, the joys he expected from his return to his native land; but di&s;appointments too often follow the hopes which have ri&s;en to the highe&s;t point, and when we think we are ju&s;t ready to gra&s;p our plea&s;ures, they elude our touch, and leave us nothing but regret.</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on had in his imagination formed many delightful &s;cenes, between him&s;elf and
<PB N="41" REF="042696_0041_101C8886E4DF58A8">his father; the evening of who&s;e days he hoped would be greatly brightened by &s;har|ing his pro&s;perity, and by his a&s;&s;iduous en|deavours to amu&s;e, if he could not relieve, the infirmities of age. But all the&s;e flatter|ing hopes are put to flight on his arrival in port; a letter being delivered him there, ac|quainting him that his father was very dan|gerou&s;ly ill, not from &s;udden &s;ickne&s;s, but a gradual decline.</P>
<P>Old Mr. Elli&s;on had taken care he &s;hould receive this intimation, to prepare him for their fir&s;t meeting, and render it le&s;s &s;hock|ing; and, to make it &s;till le&s;s affecting, he had &s;ent for his grand&s;on home, in hopes that the joy of the parent would mitigate fi|lial &s;orrow. Nor was he totally di&s;appointed; Mr. Elli&s;on could not be in&s;en&s;ible of the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his only child in health, and in appearance improved, of which the dying man gave him all the comfortable proofs he could recollect. But this, though it in &s;ome mea&s;ure alleviated his grief, &s;carce|ly &s;ufficed to render it &s;upportable.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="042696_0042_101C88447ACB6058">The indulgence he had given his imagina|tion, made the approaching death of his fa|ther more grievious. He was greatly affect|ed by the calm re&s;ignation of his mind; the patience with which he &s;upported his pain|ful di&s;temper; and the chearful and lively hopes of a ble&s;&s;ed eternity, which in his eyes di&s;armed death of all its terrors, and made him look on his la&s;t hour with the &s;ame pla|cidity, as on any one that preceded it; and &s;o well &s;upported him at the fatal in&s;tant, as to render him &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible of the pains which u&s;ually attend the &s;eparation of the &s;oul from the body.</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on determined, as &s;oon as he had &s;ettled his affairs, to fix in the country. Sir William Elli&s;on his cou&s;in-german, invited him to his &s;eat in Dor&s;et&s;hire, promi&s;ing to &s;hew him &s;everal good hou&s;es, any of which were to be hired or purcha&s;ed; and Mr. El|li&s;on was particularly inclined to fix his a|bode in that country, as it had been the place of his family's former re&s;idence. He had &s;ent over, before he left Jamaica, 45000l.
<PB N="43" REF="042696_0043_101C88886AF67960">and, be&s;ide the intere&s;t of that &s;um, he re|ceived 1200l. a year from his plantation, clear of all deductions.</P>
<P>On his arrival at his cou&s;in's &s;eat in Dor|&s;et&s;hire, he was received very affectionately. Sir William had not &s;een him from the time he fir&s;t left England, but retained a great regard for him, founded on an early ac|quaintance with his virtues. Though nearly related in blood, there was little re&s;emblance in the di&s;po&s;itions of the&s;e two gentlemen. Sir William was a man of &s;en&s;e and integrity, but a humouri&s;t. He was now, at fifty years old, a batchelor; for having been in his youth jilted by a woman he ardently loved, who, after all preliminaries to their mar|riage was &s;ettled, left him for a man of larger fortune, and more gaudy appearance, he had made a vow never more to addre&s;s any of the &s;ex; and kept that vow better than is u&s;ually done by tho&s;e who make it in a fit of re&s;entful rage and di&s;appointment. His father died &s;oon after, and left him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of 3000l. per annum, free
<PB N="44" REF="042696_0044_101C884878067BC8">from any incumbrances what&s;oever; the e&s;tate in good order, and the man&s;ion hou&s;e well furni&s;hed, and above a year's income in ca&s;h.</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on, though well plea&s;ed with Sir William's reception and conversation, find|ing he laid him under &s;ome re&s;traint, deter|mined not to make his vi&s;it very long; and, therefore &s;oon called upon the Baronet to fulfil his promi&s;e, of &s;hewing him the hou&s;es which were to be purcha&s;ed in that country.</P>
<P>After &s;eeing them all, he fixed on one al|mo&s;t adjoining to Sir William's, and pur|cha&s;ed it with the e&s;tate belonging thereto, con&s;i&s;ting of two farms of about 150l. a year each.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e was a large and good old man|&s;ion, in tolerable repair; but, having &s;tood empty near ten years, during the minority of the owner, was inwardly in very bad or|der, and the gardens entirely gone to ruin. This circum&s;tance much le&s;&s;ened the price,
<PB N="45" REF="042696_0045_101C888B40592838">but was no di&s;agreeable thing to Mr. Elli&s;on, who rather cho&s;e to lay out the place to his own ta&s;te, than to pay for what the &s;eller might call improvements.</P>
<P>He immediately purcha&s;ed it, and, being provided with a hou&s;e-keeper who had am|ple recommendations to him, he informed her, that a decent and regular oeconomy in his hou&s;e was what he expected, as far from extravagance and wa&s;tefulne&s;s as from par&s;i|mony. He would have his &s;ervants enjoy &s;oberly all the comforts of life, as he thought that to make them happy, was his fir&s;t duty; but this he knew was be&s;t done by order, re|gularity, and decent frugality. He would have &s;uch a number of &s;ervants as could per|form the bu&s;ine&s;s of his hou&s;e with ea&s;e, and therefore de&s;ired her to con&s;ider how many &s;ervants would be requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>As for the &s;tate of the adjacent poor, be|ing yet but little acquainted with it, he could give no particular directions, but wi&s;hed &s;he would inform him of what &s;he heard on that
<PB N="46" REF="042696_0046_101C884B49694958">point, and likewi&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ntion to him the &s;ort of relief &s;he judged more proper.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to &s;hew how Mr. El|li&s;on was circum&s;tanced, as to a more exten|&s;ive neighbourhood.</P>
<P>On the contrary &s;ide to Sir William's hou&s;e lived Mr. Grantham, lawful heir to the Duke of&mdash;, if that Nobleman died without child|ren; which was now highly probable, as he was above 60 years old, and his Duche&s;s but little younger. Mr. Grantham was indeed a very di&s;tant relation, yet was heir both to the e&s;tate and title; but, this branch of that great family having fallen to decay, he in|herited from his father only 50l. a year. This he farmed him&s;elf, and lived in the only hou&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had, which was little better than a common cottage. His education had been on a level with his fortune, and his manners were tho&s;e of a plain hone&s;t farm|er; yet regard for his birth, and compa&s;&s;ion for his narrow circum&s;tances, procured him a due portion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> all the neigh|bouring
<PB N="47" REF="042696_0047_101C888F6C6328C0">gentlemen. His notions of family pride had an influence over him in the choice of a wife. He thought he &s;hould di&s;grace his blood by marrying a farmer's daughter, though with &s;uch a one he might have got a few hundred pounds, which would have &s;et him much at his ea&s;e; and, a Lieutenant dying in an adjacent town where he was quar|tered, and leaving a daughter intirely unpro|vided for, and greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, he thought her a wife much more &s;uitable to the dignity of his family. Captivated by her gentility ra|ther than by her per&s;on, for &s;he was no beau|ty, he took a pride in addre&s;&s;ing the Captain's daughter (for the courte&s;y of a country town kindly be&s;tows the title of Captain on every officer) and &s;he was glad to accept of any provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>However, Mr. Grantham was more for|tunate than he had rea&s;on to expect; his wife proved very notable and indu&s;trious, on|ly too prolific, having perpetuated the fami|ly of the Granthams, of which the Duke and he were the la&s;t, by bringing him five
<PB N="48" REF="042696_0048_101C889AC75580A0">&s;ons and three daughters; a number attend|ed with great difficulties in their narrow cir|cum&s;tances; but the thought that they might one day be &s;o many Lords and Ladies, was a &s;ufficient con&s;olation, and made them behold &s;o numerous a progeny with exultation.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of about two miles from Mr. Elli&s;on's lived Mr. Allin; a gentleman who inherited a good e&s;tate from his father, but, being extravagant in his youth, had re|duced it within very narrow bounds, and in|volved him&s;elf in difficulties that had a good deal &s;oured his temper, converting his extra|vagance into par&s;imony. His &s;ociety would not have been very eligible, had it not been for an only daughter who kept his hou&s;e, who&s;e beauty, accompli&s;hments, and excel|lent qualities, rendered her the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed young woman in the whole country.</P>
<P>A little father off dwelt Mr. Blackburn, an old gentleman of great merit; who by a due mixture of &s;tudy and conver&s;ation, had great|ly embelli&s;hed an admirable under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="042696_0049_101C5CE1F6F84BD0">On the other &s;ide of Mr. Elli&s;on's hou&s;e, and about five miles from it, lived young Mr. Blackburn, &s;on to the gentleman ju&s;t menti|oned; his father having given him an e&s;tate with a good hou&s;e upon it, on his marriage with a young woman of family, but no for|tune, who&s;e beauty had captivated the young man; his father being glad to encourage any rational inclination, in hopes the &s;ociety of a woman he loved might reform him from his vices. But &s;ucce&s;s had not an&s;wered his wi&s;h|es; young Mr. Blackburn &s;oon grew tired of his wife, and returned to his bottle, to hunt|ing, gaming, and women; and behaved with &s;uch in&s;olence to his father, when he re|proached him for his di&s;&s;olute cour&s;e of life, that he bani&s;hed him his pre&s;ence, and de|clared a re&s;olution to di&s;inherit him. This breach had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted three years, when Mr. Elli&s;on came into the country; and the fa|ther &s;till as much offended, and the &s;on as far from reformation, as ever.</P>
<P>The&s;e were Mr. Elli&s;on's neare&s;t neigh|bours, and fir&s;t vi&s;itors, paying him their
<PB N="50" REF="042696_0050_101C889D8F4AD350">compliments before he had got a room fit to receive them. But, as he aimed at nothing farther than neatne&s;s and convenience, it was not long before his hou&s;e was as well furni&s;h|ed as he de&s;ired.</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on had two very particular attrac|tions in his neighbourhood; Mr. Blackburn delighted his under&s;tanding; Mi&s;s Allin cap|tivated his heart. But it is probable, that even all Mi&s;s Allin's attractions might have proved ineffectual, had they not found him in a &s;tate of lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>Bu&s;ine&s;s fir&s;t, and then duty, had hitherto defended his heart; the&s;e &s;hields were now removed, and it lay open to Cupid's arrows; in &s;uch a defencele&s;s &s;tate it might have fall|en a prey to half her perfections, and could not make the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance. Nor indeed did he wi&s;h it; he yielded him&s;elf a willing captive; for, as he had no de&s;ire to remain &s;ingle, he with plea&s;ure encouraged an incli|nation for a woman he thought &s;o well qua|lified to make him happy, and who&s;e narrow
<PB N="51" REF="042696_0051_101C5CE38745B990">circum&s;tances gave him rea&s;on to hope for a favourable reception.</P>
<P>An inclination we chu&s;e rather to encou|rage than repre&s;s is very quick in its growth. Mr. Elli&s;on had been &s;ettled but two months in Dor&s;et&s;hire, when he came to a re&s;olution of a&s;king Mr. Allin's permi&s;&s;ion to addre&s;s his daughter, giving him to under&s;tand that his fortune &s;et him above all pecuniary de|mands.</P>
<P>The great advantages his daughter would find in &s;uch an union, would have made Mr. Allin &s;ufficiently eager to compleat it, had he not been &s;purred on by the la&s;t article, which however was a &s;tronger incentive; for the mi&s;er in Moliere was not more &s;en&s;ible of the charms of that part of a lover's addre&s;s &s;ans dot, than Mr. Allin; Mr. Elli&s;on there|fore had not only his con&s;ent, but his good wi&s;hes, and &s;ecretly all the influence of his authority.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="042696_0052_101C88A052F47678">Unfortunately the father's was not the on|ly will of con&s;equence in this ca&s;e. The joy Mr. Elli&s;on felt on receiving the permi&s;&s;ion he a&s;ked was &s;oon damped; for, on ex|plaining him&s;elf to Mi&s;s Allin, &s;he bur&s;t in|to tears (having fore&s;een from the manner in which &s;he was left alone with him, what was to be the &s;ubject of his conver&s;ation) and the more generou&s;ly and nobly he expre&s;&s;ed his affection, the fa&s;ter her tears flowed. Alarmed by the tendere&s;t fears, he begged to know the cau&s;e of her di&s;tre&s;s; but, be|fore &s;he could a&s;&s;ume &s;ufficient power over her&s;elf to comply, they heard Mr. Allin com|ing towards them; Dreading his pre&s;ence, &s;he reque&s;ted her lover to conceal her unea|&s;ine&s;s; and, promi&s;ing to lay her whole heart open to him the next time they met, &s;he made her e&s;cape by one door, as her father entered at another.</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on was not much better able than his mi&s;tre&s;s to &s;upport an interview with the father; &s;o that eluding his que&s;tions, in &s;uch a manner as gave him no &s;u&s;picions of
<PB N="53" REF="042696_0053_101C88BC5B831358">what had pa&s;&s;ed, he pretended bu&s;ine&s;s that obliged him to return home directly.</P>
<P>He &s;hut him&s;elf up in his room, in a &s;tate of mind which the heart may gue&s;s, but words cannot de&s;cribe. He pa&s;&s;ed the night in an agitation and anxiety he had before no conception of; the hope which &s;elf-flattery would &s;ometimes &s;ugge&s;t, only &s;erved to pre|vent his exerting his rea&s;on to &s;upport what his fears anticipated. He ro&s;e before the &s;un, with a re&s;olution to know his fate ere the day was over, but wi&s;hed to learn it with|out Mr. Allin's knowledge.</P>
<P>Unable to contrive any means of effecting this de&s;ire, the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of his mind led him abroad; and the impul&s;e of his heart directed him towards Mr. Allin's hou&s;e. He wandered in the adjacent fields a long time, uncertain what methods to pur&s;ue, and fear|ing to create unea&s;ine&s;s to the woman for whom he &s;uffered &s;o much.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="042696_0054_101C88A1D9F94AC0">At length Mi&s;s Allin, who had not re&s;ted much better than her lover, going to the window in hopes new objects might divert her thoughts, &s;aw him in a field adjoining to the garden.

<P>When he &s;aw her approach, he had &s;carce|ly courage to meet her, dreading the expla|nation he had &s;o impatiently longed for. Maiden ba&s;hfulne&s;s, with &s;ome mixture of concern on one &s;ide, and extreme agitation of &s;pirits on the other, rendered them equal|ly unable to &s;peak; but with common, though tacit con&s;ent, they &s;at down together on a green bank at the foot of a tree; a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;i|lence en&s;ued; and it is difficult to &s;ay when it would have ended, if Mi&s;s Allin had not

<P>She then told him that &s;he had, with her father's con&s;ent, been engaged above a year to Dr. Tun&s;tall, a young phy&s;ician in the neighbourhood; and their marriage had been &s;o long deferred, only by the difficulties her father found, or that his par&s;imonious tem|per made him imagine, in rai&s;ing 2000l. the &s;um he had promi&s;ed to give with her: That &s;he received the Doctor as her intended hu&s;|band at her father's command, when her heart was &s;o little prejudiced in his favour, that &s;he could, without any &s;evere pang, have been equally obedient, had be ordered her
<PB N="56" REF="042696_0056_101C88A618DF3000">never to &s;ee him any more; but, &s;ince &s;he had con&s;idered it as her duty and happine&s;s to increa&s;e the little prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;he had conceived, the ca&s;e was much altered, and &s;he was now as &s;trongly engaged to him in affection, as in honour; An engagement &s;he was determined not to violate, though &s;he de&s;paired of &s;eeing it fulfilled; for &s;he had received an expre&s;s command from her father never to entertain the lea&s;t acquaintance or corre&s;pondence with Dr. Tun&s;tall, but to look on Mr. Elli&s;on as her hu&s;band, and &s;he feared he would never revoke the decree; &s;ince, be&s;ide the many rea&s;ons, which &s;he was &s;en&s;ible there was for preferring him to the Doctor, his genero&s;ity had added one, that with her father was in&s;urmountable, by de|clining the acceptance of a fortune.</P>
<P>She proceeded to &s;ay, that &s;he had nothing to expect but her father's anger, which was impetuous and dreadful; all, therefore, &s;he had to a&s;k of Mr. Elli&s;on, who, &s;he hoped would rather think her unfortunate than un|grateful, was, that he would, as far as lay in
<PB N="57" REF="042696_0057_101C87E720513D38">his power, mitigate her father's rage, and prevail with him to let her live peaceably in her pre&s;ent condition; for &s;he relinqui&s;hed all hopes of changing it; and did it with the le&s;s concern, as &s;he imagined his partiality for her might render it more vexatious to him to &s;ee her married to another, than merely to be di&s;appointed of her him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe the effect Mi&s;s Allin's words had upon Mr. Elli&s;on. She felt &s;o lively a compa&s;&s;ion for him, that &s;he forgot her own grief, and &s;aid every thing &s;he thought might contribute to his con&s;ola|tion, except what alone could prove effectual; but, as &s;he was fully determined to adhere &s;trictly to her engagement, &s;he carefully a|voided giving him the lea&s;t room to hope a change in her &s;entiments.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as his mind was a little compo&s;ed, he took his leave; a&s;&s;uring her that he would try every means to &s;ecure her peace, though he was not yet &s;ufficiently ma&s;ter of his thoughts, to &s;ee the manner in which it
<PB N="58" REF="042696_0058_101C88A8DB4CBD30">would be mo&s;t advi&s;eable for him to pro|ceed.</P>
<P>Each returned to their re&s;pective hou&s;es, but with different &s;en&s;ations; &s;he found her heart much lightened, &s;ince &s;he had ac|quainted her generous lover with the &s;tate of it; but he carried back de&s;pair in&s;tead of uncertainty.</P>
<P>However, after &s;ome time &s;pent in reflec|tion, he grew re&s;igned and patient, and, not|with&s;tanding his di&s;appointment, he was ar|dently de&s;irous to re&s;tore Mi&s;s Allin to the happine&s;s, of which he had for a time depriv|ed her; and re&s;olved to perform his promi&s;e more effectually than &s;he could expect.</P>
<P>Accordingly, three days after he had re|ceived his &s;entence from her, he &s;ent an in|vitation to Mr. Allin to dine with him; and took that opportunity of acquainting him, that, &s;ince he was la&s;t at his hou&s;e, he had learnt that Mi&s;s Allin had long been engaged, with his con&s;ent, to Dr. Tun&s;tall, and there|fore
<PB N="59" REF="042696_0059_101C87E8AB0584F0">had re&s;olved to de&s;i&s;t from his preten&s;i|ons; as he &s;hould think him&s;elf very crimi|nal, if, taking the advantage of a &s;uperiori|ty of fortune, he &s;hould attempt to deprive another of a ble&s;&s;ing which mu&s;t be &s;o dear to him; and indeed, he &s;hould have &s;o bad an opinion of a woman who could be merce|nary and incon&s;tant enough to break her word, though in his favour, as would render it impo&s;&s;ible for him to be happy with her.</P>
<P>Mr. Allin was much di&s;concerted at this declaration, and an&s;wered: He might do as he plea&s;ed; but that as for Dr. Tun&s;tall, if he intended to marry his daughter, he mu&s;t wait till bu&s;ine&s;s increa&s;ed, or death put her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his little e&s;tate, for he found it impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e a fortune for her, with|out di&s;tre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>From the account Mr. Elli&s;on had heard of his circum&s;tances, he ea&s;ily believed there was &s;ome truth in what he &s;aid; and told him he would remove that objection, only de&s;ir|ing him to confirm his former con&s;ent with
<PB N="60" REF="042696_0060_101C88ABB43F4268">a good grace, and not dimini&s;h the &s;atisfac|tion of his daughter by an apparent reluct|ance, or even the coldne&s;s of his compliance.</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on was not &s;low in executing his purpo&s;e. He wrote Mi&s;s Allin a letter the next morning, wherein he inclo&s;ed a draught on his banker for 2000l. His genero&s;ity went &s;till farther; he feared her father would not acquit him&s;elf properly in regard to her cloaths; and con&s;idered that, as the income of the man &s;he married was very &s;mall, to be well equipped might prove hereafter much to her convenience; he therefore &s;ent his hou&s;e|keeper to the next great town, to buy &s;ilks, lace, cambrick, mu&s;lins, hollands, in &s;uch abundance, as would not only enable her to make a very genteel appearance on her mar|riage, but &s;uffice for &s;ome years; and he cho&s;e to do it in this manner, rather than to make her a pre&s;ent of the money, as the &s;ure&s;t means of &s;ecuring her convenience, to which, moderation and genero&s;ity might have made her le&s;s attentive.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="042696_0061_101C87EE4CF70010">The plea&s;ure he felt in this di&s;intere&s;ted conduct, almo&s;t extingui&s;hed for the time the &s;en&s;e of &s;orrow; but the heart will have its due; when the gratification began to deaden, vexation returned, and he could gladly have excu&s;ed a vi&s;it Dr. Tun&s;tall made him, in order to return thanks for his genero&s;ity; which Mr. Elli&s;on learnt from him, was with great pain accepted by Mi&s;s Allin; nor could any thing, but her father's expre&s;s and ab&s;o|lute command, have conquered her reluct|ance in this particular.

<P>His politene&s;s, however, did not for&s;ake him on &s;o &s;evere a trial; he commanded both his countenance and words &s;o well, as to give his happy rival a kind, though melancholy

<P>While Mr. Elli&s;on flattered him&s;elf with the hopes of marrying Mi&s;s Allin, he delay|ed &s;ettling his family in the order he intend|ed, thinking it more advi&s;eable to regulate the whole at once; but, when that pro&s;pect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, there no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ted any rea|&s;on for po&s;tponing it.</P>
<P>The knowledge he had of his &s;on's impe|tuous temper, and bad qualities, determined him to educate him at home. Whether he would there acquire an equal &s;hare of learn|ing as at &s;chool, he much que&s;tioned, but the rectifying his heart appeared to him the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential article towards his happi|ne&s;s; and, of all knowledge that he mo&s;t wi&s;hed him to acquire, was the knowledge of him&s;elf, and the means of governing his pa&s;&s;ions; in the&s;e points he thought he might
<PB N="63" REF="042696_0063_101C87F1220D6458">be better in&s;tructed under his own eye than at &s;chool; and, if thereby he could render him an hone&s;t and amiable man, he &s;hould have good rea&s;on to be contented, though he did not prove a learned one.</P>
<P>He had already begun to make proper in|quiries after a well qualified tutor; and was likely to &s;ucceed, as he had &s;et no bounds to the &s;alary. A gentleman of excellent cha|racter, great learning, and amiable manners, having met with &s;ome di&s;appointments in the profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic, to which he was bred, was very glad of &s;o eligible a retirement, on a promi&s;ed &s;alary of 400l. a year; and as Mr. Elli&s;on was &s;o great a ma&s;ter in the &s;ci|ence of benevolence, that he performed few actions that did not bear more than one good fruit, he had in view the &s;erving Mr. Gran|tham by the home education of his &s;on, and therefore made it a condition, that the tutor &s;hould teach as many boys as he plea&s;ed, with the &s;ame care as his own.
<PB N="64" REF="042696_0064_101C88B142920908">The little Granthams &s;pent few be&s;ide their &s;leeping hours at home; for, as their father's hou&s;e almo&s;t joined to Mr. Elli&s;on's, they re|turned thither without inconvenience every night, coming early the next morning; and having at Mr. Elli&s;on's both their corporal and mental food; the fir&s;t of which was &s;ome ea&s;e to the narrow circum&s;tances of tho&s;e good people, and the latter gave their father the mo&s;t &s;incere joy, as he now &s;aw them in a way of being educated equal to their birth, and future fortune, of which he had before utterly de&s;paired. Indeed he found his ex|pence much lightened; for Mr. Elli&s;on care|fully provided them apparel, in every re&s;pect equal to that worn by his own &s;on; and was very watchful that the latter a&s;&s;umed no &s;u|periority over them, to whom he &s;hewed him he was in reality greatly inferior; but this was explained to him in the ab&s;ence of the Grantham's; for Mr. Elli&s;on wi&s;hed for their &s;akes the thought might not occur to them; and exhorted their father and mother not to de&s;troy one benefit ari&s;ing from their pre&s;ent low e&s;tate, which might greatly add to the
<PB N="65" REF="042696_0065_101C87F2A80C4220">happine&s;s of their lives, by in&s;tilling into their minds a pride that mu&s;t be the &s;ource both of private chagrin, and public contempt.</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on was not &s;o wholly engaged ei|ther by private vexation, or dome&s;tic bu&s;i|ne&s;s, as not to extend his attention to all his neighbours. The little e&s;tate he had bought lay in three pari&s;hes, which gave him a knowledge of the &s;tate of each.</P>
<P>He found the poor tax ran very high, and yet the poor were but ill taken care of; the farmer was much burdened, the poor but lit|tle relieved.</P>
<P>All the&s;e inconveniencies he endeavoured to apply remedies to, which he did effectual|ly; and, be&s;ides relieving the wants of the poor, he promoted a &s;pirit of indu&s;try among them.</P>
<P>On other occurrences his benevolent di&s;|po&s;ition &s;carce knew any bounds; he com|po&s;ed all differences in his neighbourhood,

<P>The&s;e &s;cenes were indeed the great fea&s;ts of his &s;oul; but all his hours yielded him re|fined plea&s;ures, becau&s;e they were all &s;pent in the exerci&s;e of benevolence; a de&s;ire to do good to others, was &s;o intirely his go|verning principle, that, however engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure, he never lo&s;t &s;ight of it, endeavouring to promote it by every action of his life.</P>
<P>Though temperance and virtue are the be&s;t pre&s;ervatives of health, yet they cannot &s;e|cure to any one an uninterrupted &s;tate. Mr. Elli&s;on, while employed in a&s;&s;iduous endea|vours to alleviate the &s;ufferings of others, became him&s;elf the object of compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="042696_0067_101C87F58894EE10">He was &s;eized with a violent fever, which &s;o far baffled the &s;kill and care of Dr. Tun|&s;tall, for whom he had &s;ent on being fir&s;t taken ill, that in three days he was entirely delirious, and his life judged to be in great danger. The grief of his friends and de|pendants is ea&s;ier to be imagined than de|&s;cribed; but none felt more &s;incerely on the occa&s;ion than Mrs. Tun&s;tall, who&s;e gratitude attached her very &s;trongly to him, though &s;he had never been in his company &s;ince the morning that determined him to give up all preten&s;ions to her.</P>
<P>She always waited the Doctor's return with impatient anxiety, and was greatly affected by the account her hu&s;band gave her, in the be|ginning of the &s;econd week of Mr. Elli&s;on's illne&s;s, of the accident which had happened to his hou&s;e-keeper; who, by a fall down &s;tairs, had put out her ankle, and mu&s;t be totally confined to her chamber; whereby Mr. Elli&s;on was deprived of a very careful, tender, and &s;en&s;ible nur&s;e, which his &s;ituati|on rendered extremely nece&s;&s;ary, and yet the

<P>Mrs. Tun&s;tall was &s;hocked to think of the danger he mu&s;t run in &s;uch hands, and, pre|&s;uming that in his in&s;ane &s;tate of mind he would not know her, propo&s;ed attending him her&s;elf, though it might prove very danger|ous in her pre&s;ent &s;tate, &s;he being then in the eighth month of her pregnancy. The Doctor's tenderne&s;s for his amiable wife, made him very unwilling to con&s;ent, but &s;he urged him with &s;uch per&s;ua&s;ive importunity, that he at length, though reluctantly, agreed to carry her to Mr. Elli&s;on's that very day.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to imagine that Mrs. Tun&s;tall mu&s;t perform with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;iduity, an office &s;he undertook out of gratitude. The only re&s;t &s;he allowed her&s;elf was on a couch, in Mr. Elli&s;on's chamber; &s;he mixed all his medicines, and gave him every thing he took,
<PB N="69" REF="042696_0069_101C87F9B282D4F8">but was careful not to approach his bed-&s;ide on his fir&s;t waking, le&s;t &s;leep might calm his delirium, and expo&s;e her to his knowledge.</P>
<P>She was &s;eldom out of his chamber, ex|cept during one or two &s;hort vi&s;its &s;he daily made his hou&s;e-keeper, for a whole week that he continued in the &s;ame melancholy &s;tate; he then began to recover his &s;en&s;es, but was &s;o weak and &s;pent, he took little no|tice of any thing that pa&s;&s;ed; &s;he therefore prolonged her attendance for &s;ome days, keeping out of his &s;ight, but directing the nur&s;e, and watching that all proper care was taken; and &s;he had the &s;atisfaction, before Mr. Elli&s;on was well enough to di&s;cover there was any other per&s;on than his nur&s;e in the room, to &s;ee the hou&s;e-keeper able to be brought in, and take the &s;ame care &s;he her|&s;elf had done for &s;ome days; whereupon with great joy &s;he re&s;igned her office, and return|ed home.</P>
<P>Every day confirmed her in this ea&s;y &s;tate of mind; for his recovery, though &s;low was
<PB N="70" REF="042696_0070_101C88B998336388">uninterrupted; and the many hearts which his extreme danger had oppre&s;&s;ed with grief and anxiety were relieved from their heavy burden; more &s;en&s;ible than ever of the value of the man on whom their happine&s;s depend|ed, as all their &s;en&s;ibility had been awakened by his illne&s;s.</P>
<P>Caution had been given to Sir. William and the hou&s;e-keeper, not to di&s;clo&s;e Mrs. Tun&s;tall's attendance; but the appearance of &s;o &s;trong an attachment, the hazard &s;he had run, and the uncommonne&s;s of the acti|on, had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on Sir William, that the utmo&s;t his prudence could effect, was to be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, till his cou&s;in was pretty well recovered; and then news being brought them, as they were &s;it|ting together, that Mrs. Tun&s;tall was brought to bed, he could not forbear ob&s;erving, that &s;he had but ju&s;t had time to recover her fatigue.</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on u&s;ually avoided entering into any conver&s;ation on a &s;ubject wherein he felt
<PB N="71" REF="042696_0071_101C87FC79AA5828">him&s;elf too tenderly intere&s;ted, but his &s;en&s;i|bility on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion put him off his guard; and he enquired to what fatigue Sir William alluded.</P>
<P>The Baronet could no longer re&s;i&s;t the de|&s;ire he felt of acquainting his cou&s;in with Mrs. Tun&s;tall's extraordinary care of him, to which, Mr. Elli&s;on li&s;tened with equal &s;ur|pri&s;e and plea&s;ure. Her conduct on this oc|ca&s;ion had the effect &s;he feared from it, if it came to his knowledge, for it awakened eve|ry tender &s;en&s;ation; but the&s;e were not ac|companied with the pain &s;he thought might attend them. He had brought him&s;elf to &s;uch a patient acquie&s;cence in the decrees of Providence, that, while he cheri&s;hed the re|membrance of her with tenderne&s;s, his re|gret for his di&s;appointment was calm and tem|perate. He attributed her care to the grati|tude of a noble mind, and felt ineffable plea|&s;ure in &s;o &s;trong a proof, that his e&s;teem was ju&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="042696_0072_101C5CE06D0B72C8">Mr. Elli&s;on, as the mo&s;t likely means of perfecting his recovery, made &s;ome excur&s;i|ons into different parts of the country, and it was for a con&s;iderable time before he again &s;ettled at home.</P>
<P>At his return, he was &s;hocked at the evils election-drunkenne&s;s had cau&s;ed in his neigh|bourhood; and Dr. Tun&s;tall particularly, be|ing violent in politics, and having exerted him&s;elf much during the conte&s;t, acquired &s;uch a habit of drinking, and entered into intimacies with &s;o many people who made it their chief plea&s;ure, that the love of it did not cea&s;e with the fir&s;t inducement.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tun&s;tall's &s;ituation was hereupon ve|ry melancholy. She daily beheld the man &s;he loved in the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tful condition; and, when not ab&s;olutely intoxicated, the effects of the former night's debauch, &s;o &s;tu|pified and di&s;ordered him, that he was not capable of conver&s;ation, nor &s;u&s;ceptible of affection. Add to this, that the &s;en&s;ible de|cline of their circum&s;tances, from &s;uch a
<PB N="73" REF="042696_0073_101C87FF4F115878">perpetual round of rioting, made her dread the con&s;equences that mu&s;t attend it.</P>
<P>Mr. Elli&s;on's humanity was of &s;o quick and lively a kind, that it did not wait to be informed of a per&s;on's particular &s;ufferings; from comparing their income with their ne|ce&s;&s;ary expences, he knew when they were under any difficulties in point of circum|&s;tances, and this induced him to prevail up|on Mrs. Tun&s;tall's father to receive from him a proper &s;upply for her u&s;e, as coming from him&s;elf.</P>
<P>However, Dr. Tun&s;tall was not to be re|claimed, and he at la&s;t fell a victim to his pa&s;&s;ion, being &s;eized with a high fever, which, in a few days, put a period to his life.</P>
<P>Had Mr. Elli&s;on obeyed the impul&s;e of his heart, he would have flown to the di&s;con&s;o|late widow, and endeavoured, by all the tender &s;en&s;ibilities that can &s;pring from friend|&s;hip, to have &s;oothed her grief; but he fear|ed &s;uch a conduct might appear &s;carcely de|cent;
<PB N="74" REF="042696_0074_101C88BF2AAB4760">in one, who&s;e &s;entiments were &s;o well known; and, while he acted only as a friend, her reputation might be wounded, by being &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o &s;oon to receive the a&s;&s;iduities of a lover, and her delicacy offended by any marks of regard, which might bear the ap|pearance of &s;o early a renewal of his former addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations made him forbear vi&s;iting her for the pre&s;ent; and, when he thought he might vi&s;it her with decency, the preference he often gave his duties to the plea&s;ures ari&s;ing from her &s;ociety, made her fancy his having no views beyond the en|joyment of her friend&s;hip, till the expiration of the fir&s;t year of her widowhood, during which he had condemned him&s;elf to ab&s;olute &s;ilence, concerning the &s;ituation of his heart; but, having given &s;o much time to worldly form, he was determined no longer to delay what was due to him&s;elf, after having fulfill|ed all, that decorum could po&s;&s;ibly expect; he, therefore declared frankly to her, how little alteration time had made in his affecti|on;
<PB N="75" REF="042696_0075_101C8800E024F548">and intreated &s;he would give him leave to hope, that &s;he would li&s;ten to his addre&s;&s;|es with more complacency than when he fir&s;t made them.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tun&s;tall was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed at Mr. Elli&s;on's con&s;tancy, and not a little puz|zled in what manner to an&s;wer him; but, as he in&s;i&s;ted on a reply, &s;he &s;tammered out &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of the honour he did her, the greatne&s;s of the advantages he thus of|fered her, and her high &s;en&s;e of the obliga|tions &s;he lay under, which mu&s;t incline her to wi&s;h to comply with any reque&s;t of his.</P>
<P>This &s;ort of cold reception was ill &s;uited to the ardor of Mr. Elli&s;on's pa&s;&s;ion; he therefore begged that politene&s;s, gratitude, and, above all, intere&s;t, might be out of the que&s;tion; for, though amiable virtues, yet his heart was too delicate, or too capricious, to be contented with receiving them in re|turn for his warme&s;t affections.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="042696_0076_101C88C1EFB21928">Mrs. Tun&s;tall's &s;ituation was rendered the more perplexing, by being really ignorant of the &s;tate of her own heart. She had only con&s;idered him as a mo&s;t amiable and worthy friend, and knew not whether &s;he could with plea&s;ure con&s;ent to be united to him by a tenderer tie; however, &s;he could &s;afely pro|mi&s;e all his delicacy required, not to marry him except he became the free di&s;intere&s;ted choice of her heart. Mr. Elli&s;on had no &s;ooner received this a&s;&s;urance, than he re|pented his reque&s;t; but his, apprehen&s;ions were groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tun&s;tall was not quite &s;o indifferent as &s;he imagined; love &s;eldom ri&s;es to a blaze, till it is fanned with hope; and in a few other vi&s;its &s;he declared to him that &s;he could no longer re&s;i&s;t any inclination of his; on the contrary, found her affection for him grow &s;o intire, that &s;he wi&s;hed to have it made her duty to love him with a warm and undi|vided heart.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="042696_0077_101C8804EE6355F0">Every circum&s;tance now &s;eemed to concur to make Mr. Elli&s;on completely happy, when, three days before that fixed on for his nupti|als, he received a letter from Mrs. Blackburn, informing him, that her hu&s;band was in the hands of the &s;heriff's officers, and, if he did not take compa&s;&s;ion upon him, he mu&s;t be immediately removed to pri&s;on, as they were not able to di&s;charge the debt, and the cre|ditor refu&s;ed to take Mr. Blackburn's bond, knowing his whole fortune was mortgaged.</P>
<P>Fewer intreaties would have &s;ufficed to bring Mr. Elli&s;on to their relief. He &s;et out in all ha&s;te on hor&s;eback, but had not gone three miles, when his hor&s;e threw him. He was at fir&s;t intirely &s;tunned by the fall; but pain in a &s;hort time brought him to him&s;elf, and convinced him that his thigh was broke. His &s;ervant &s;ent off a me&s;&s;enger to a &s;urgeon to meet him at his own hou&s;e, and with great difficulty got him home.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tun&s;tall was &s;hocked to the greate&s;t degree at this melancholy news, and imme|diately
<PB N="78" REF="042696_0078_101C88C4C15199C8">determined that the want of the mar|riage ceremony &s;hould not prevent her at|tendance on him, during his confinement. She had once acted this part from gratitude; and tru&s;ted &s;he might now, without cen&s;ure, be allowed to perform it through affection. Her tender attentions greatly alleviated Mr. Elli&s;on's pains, but could not effect his cure; the third day after the fracture, a mortifica|tion began, which gave the &s;urgeons the mo&s;t alarming apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>Melancholy as his &s;ituation was, no dejec|tion appeared in his countenance, and, as &s;oon as he apprehended his life was in dang|er, he con&s;idered of the be&s;t methods of pre|venting others from &s;uffering by his death. He charged on his fortune the &s;upport of all the charities and benevolences he had e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. He di&s;charged Mr. Blackburn's debt, and bequeathed ten thou&s;and pounds to Mrs. Tun&s;tall; and, as his &s;on's fortune could not fail of being great, &s;ince Sir William's e&s;tate would come to him, he charged it with an|nuities for all his dependants; he had not a

<P>His harde&s;t trial was yet to come, the tak|ing leave of his &s;on and intended &s;pou&s;e.

He recapitulated the &s;ub&s;tance of all the in&s;tructions he had for &s;o many years been inculcating, and be&s;eeched him with tears, and the tendere&s;t care&s;&s;es, to im|print them deeply on his heart.</P>
<P>But his &s;evere&s;t ta&s;k was taking leave of Mrs. Tun&s;tall, who approached his bed more dead than alive. He bade her not grieve for him, &s;ince he tru&s;ted he was going to the only place where he could find a happine&s;s

<P>At night, when the &s;urgeons examined his leg, they found the mortification, to their &s;urpri&s;e, had not advanced. The next day the &s;ymptoms appeared &s;till a little more fa|vourable, and in a few days, beyond all ex|pectation, he was declared out of danger; and he now found that the life he could &s;o con|tentedly have parted with, was &s;till extreme|ly dear to him. But, had it indeed lo&s;t its charms, it mu&s;t have obtained new ones from the joy that was diffu&s;ed over the whole neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tun&s;tall was ever rejoicing over his re&s;tored life, or on her knees giving thanks for &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing, till Mr. Elli&s;on was &s;ufficiently recovered to confirm at church the union of their hearts, which love had be|fore completed; an union which every &s;uc|ceeding

<P>Mr. Elli&s;on had now no wi&s;h ungratified. Mrs. Elli&s;on returned his affection in the tendere&s;t manner, and completed his happi|ne&s;s, by entering into all his views, and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing him in every work of humanity, wherein her heart was as deeply engaged as his.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after Mr. Elli&s;on's marri|age Sir William died, and left him heir to his e&s;tate and title.</P>

Guid|ed by it, he was early led to indefatigable in|du&s;try, and a &s;teady and prudent attention to bu&s;ine&s;s.

<P><PB N="83" REF="042696_0083_101C8893C7EF5388">His indu&s;try, as it was guided by a a ge|nerous prudence, and a con&s;tant and &s;teady adherence to the dictates of con&s;cience and humanity, could not fail of the greate&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;s;&mdash;but although it rai&s;ed him to the great|e&s;t affluence, it did not rai&s;e him above him|&s;elf&mdash;he &s;till retained the &s;entiments he at fir&s;t &s;et out with, ble&s;&s;ing and crowning with the mo&s;t delightful happine&s;s, all around him&mdash; He &s;ought not the favours of the great, or the re&s;pect of the affluent&mdash;but the approba|tion of his own con&s;cience.&mdash;He delighted not in the bu&s;tle of courts or of the world&mdash;but, while he thought it his duty, he gave him&s;elf to bu&s;ine&s;s, and pur&s;ued it with unwearied attention; and, being favoured by Heaven to the utmo&s;t of his wi&s;hes, he cho&s;e a retire|ment mo&s;t &s;uitable to his inclination; where, &s;eque&s;tered from the noi&s;e and bu&s;tle of life, he could gratify, unmole&s;ted, the pure&s;t de|&s;ires of his &s;oul, and enjoy him&s;elf in peace and &s;atisfaction&mdash;where, envied by none&mdash; but adored by all&mdash;he might be a father to the fatherle&s;s&mdash;and a protector to the widow &mdash;a comforter to the afflicted&mdash;and a friend to the whole human race.</P>
