<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 CHRON. XXIV, 15, 16.</HI></BIBL>
<P>But <HI>JEHOIADA</HI> waxed old, and was full of Days when he died&mdash;And they buried him in the City of David among the Kings, becau&s;e he had done <HI>GOOD</HI> in <HI>ISRAEL,</HI> both towards GOD, and towards his Hou&s;e.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE excellent per&s;on who is the &s;ubject of our text, was one who truly adorned his &s;ta|tion by his eminent &s;ervices. Being high-prie&s;t of the Jews, it was doubtle&s;s under his protec|tion that young JOASH was concealed in the temple &s;ix years, when ATHALIAH cut off all the re&s;t of the &s;eed royal. It was through his
<PB N="4" REF="037963_0003_10102DEDE277DA40">
in&s;trumentality that Judah was recovered from the tyranny and idolatry of <HI>"that wicked woman,"</HI> and the prince &s;et upon the throne of his ance&s;tors. He continued through life to be the chief coun&s;ellor and prime mini&s;ter of the king, <HI>"who did that which was right in the &s;ight of the LORD all the days of</HI> JEHOIADA <HI>the prie&s;t".</HI> And it was he who aided his &s;overeign in repairing the hou&s;e of GOD, and re&s;toring the temple wor&s;hip. Thus we &s;ee why it is &s;aid of him, that "HE DID GOOD IN ISRAEL."</P>
<P>FOR this he obtained at his death an honor which was refu&s;ed to JOASH him&s;elf. For after the death of the high-prie&s;t, this prince turned a&s;ide to idolatry, and &s;lew the &s;ons of his bene|factor; for which he was &s;lain by his own &s;er|vants, and buried in the city of David, but <HI>"not in the &s;epulchres of the kings."</HI> Where|as when JEHOIADA died, old and full of days, <HI>"they buried him in the city of David, among the kings;"</HI> treating him with a re&s;pect &s;imilar to that which was conferred on good HEZEKIAH, who, when he &s;lept with his fathers, was buried <HI>"in the chief of the &s;epulchres of the &s;ons of</HI> DAVID; <HI>and all Judah, and the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem did him honor at his death."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="037963_0004_10102DF04F5A38B8">HENCE it appears to be agreeable to the will of GOD, that his di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ervants, whom he has been plea&s;ed to employ in doing much good, &s;hould be honored at their death, by having &s;ome &s;uitable re&s;pect paid to their me|mory.</P>
<P>AFTER I have &s;hewn what re&s;pect is to be paid to the memory of eminent men; and the ground on which they are to be honored at their death; I &s;hall direct your attention particularly to the occa&s;ion on which we are at pre&s;ent convened.</P>
<P>WE are, no doubt, to &s;hew re&s;pect to the memory of the excellent of the earth, by mourning for them, after the example of JACOB's &s;ons mourning for their father&mdash;of Judah and Jeru&s;alem mourning for JOSIAH, and other in&s;tan|ces of the &s;ame kind. This mourning, how|ever, is not to be confined to inward and &s;e|cret grief; it is fit that this grief be expre&s;&s;ed by &s;ome external tokens, &s;uch as vi&s;ible badges of mourning, or funeral elegies; and that the remembrance of the per&s;on be perpetuated by &s;ome kind of records, or &s;epulchral monuments. This is the way in which we manife&s;t our &s;orrow
<PB N="6" REF="037963_0005_10102DF1F9B5DD60">
and re&s;pect for our private friends or relatives decea&s;ed: JACOB erected a pillar for his RACHEL, called <HI>"The pillar of Rachel's grave;"</HI> and DAVID bewailed his ABSALOM, &s;aying, <HI>"O my &s;on Ab&s;alom! my &s;on, my &s;on Ab&s;alom! Would GOD I had died for thee, O Ab&s;alom, my &s;on, my &s;on!"</HI> And it is &s;uitable, that in &s;ome &s;uch way we expre&s;s our &s;orrow, and manife&s;t our e&s;teem for the faithful friends and benefactors of our country. Thus did DAVID and his people at the death of ABNER: They rent their clothes, girded them&s;elves with &s;ackcloth, and mourned before him. <HI>"The king followed the bier; he lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept."</HI> Undoubtedly, exter|nal &s;igns of mourning were not wanting at the thre&s;hing-floor of Atad, where JOSEPH and his company <HI>"mourned for</HI> JACOB <HI>&s;even days, with a great and very &s;ore lamentation,"</HI> &s;o that the Ca|naanites took notice of it, and &s;aid, <HI>"This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians."</HI> On the death of SAUL and JONATHAN, DAVID wrote a very pathetic funeral elegy, which &s;tands re|corded in the &s;econd book of Samuel; and in the Chronicles we are told, that <HI>"All Judah and Jeru&s;alem mourned for</HI> JOSIAH; that JERE|MIAH <HI>lamented for him; and that the &s;inging men,
<PB N="7" REF="037963_0006_10102DF38B91EA00">
and the &s;inging women &s;pake of</HI> JOSIAH <HI>in their la|mentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in I&s;rael; and behold they are written in the La|mentations."</HI> Thus it appears, not only that it is agreeable to the will of GOD, that his eminent &s;ervants &s;hould be honored at their death; but likewi&s;e what kind of honor or re&s;pect is to be paid to their memory.</P>
<P>LET us, in the next place, attend to the ground on which this honour is to be conferred on &s;uch per&s;onages. It is becau&s;e they are the &s;ervants of the great GOD, whom he has &s;ignalized by placing them in high &s;tations, and employing them in important &s;ervices to the church, or to the &s;tate. We are expre&s;sly told, that the rea&s;on why JEHOIADA had the honor of being buried among the kings was, <HI>"becau&s;e he had done good in I&s;rael, both towards GOD, and towards his hou&s;e."</HI> When we pay re&s;pect to great men for their own &s;akes only, we rob GOD of his honor, and become guilty of a kind of idolatry. But when we regard them as the gifts of Heaven&mdash; as men whom GOD has qualified and rai&s;ed up for eminent &s;ervice, and be&s;towed on us as ble&s;|&s;ings from his hand; the honor conferred on them, in this view, is con&s;ecrated to GOD, and
<PB N="8" REF="037963_0007_10102DF7E5EDE278">
ultimately redounds to his glory. Under this impre&s;&s;ion, we may give &s;cope to our affec|tions, and freely extol the virtues, and cele|brate the prai&s;es of the men <HI>"whom the KING of kings hath delighted to honour."</HI></P>
<P>WHAT now calls your attention, as the &s;pecial bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, is the tribute of re&s;pect that is due to the memory of our departed friend, and the friend of our country, the renowned WASH|INGTON. It is, perhaps, beyond my power to inform this a&s;&s;embly on the &s;ubject, or to increa&s;e its e&s;teem for the memory of this mo&s;t excellent man. His character and his deeds are well known to all who are capable of knowing them. Yet in honor of the Father of our country, it is &s;uitable, on this occa&s;ion, to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e which we entertain of the worth of this ine&s;timable gift of Heaven, with which GOD has favored us &s;o long, and which in the &s;overeign and wi&s;e di&s;pen&s;a|tions of his providence, he has been plea&s;ed to recall.</P>
<P>WHETHER we con&s;ider this illu&s;trious per&s;on as a warrior or a &s;tate&s;man, we cannot but admire the goodne&s;s of GOD in enduing him with tal|ents &s;o &s;uitable to his &s;tation. His wi&s;dom and
<PB N="9" REF="037963_0008_10102DFC032148E8">
prudence, his magnanimity, per&s;everance and fidelity, cannot fail to arre&s;t our attention. In him we beheld greatne&s;s without pride, and hu|mility without meanne&s;s. In him firmne&s;s and re&s;olution were blended with gentlene&s;s and hu|manity. Never was a Commander more loved by his &s;oldiers, or more revered by his very en|emies. Never did a man more fully po&s;&s;e&s;s the confidence of his fellow citizens, nor was ever one more highly e&s;teemed both by his own coun|try, and by foreign nations.</P>
<P>A MAN thus qualified, was a fit in&s;trument in the hand of the GOD of armies and the Sovereign of the world, to be employed in accompli&s;hing great and valuable purpo&s;es. What he has achieved, as well in the chair of &s;tate, as in the high places of the field, America has witne&s;&s;ed, and the world has been informed.</P>
<P>WHEN we were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of de|fending our lives, our liberty and our property, again&s;t one of the mo&s;t powerful and warlike nations of Europe&mdash;when we had neither fleets nor di&s;ciplined armies&mdash;when our troops were without arms, ammunition or clothing&mdash;WASH|INGTON,
<PB N="10" REF="037963_0009_1010210519257448">
at the call of his country, &s;tepped forth and girded on the &s;word. He in&s;pired our ar|mies with confidence&mdash;taught them the u&s;e of arms, and led them to conque&s;t. His &s;kill in ma|naging an inferior force again&s;t &s;uperior num|bers; his prudence in avoiding a general action without a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; and his prompt|ne&s;s in &s;eizing the favorable moment of advan|tageous combat, will be admired as long as hi&s;tory &s;hall record the deeds of warriors.</P>
<P>THE effects of his military &s;kill and prowe&s;s were the &s;alvation of our country, and the free|dom and independence of the American States.</P>
<P>AT the clo&s;e of the war he laid down the &s;word, re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion, and retired to the peaceful &s;hades of Mount Vernon; where he hoped to end his days in quiet repo&s;e, free from the burden of public care. But, by the unanimous voice of his fellow citizens, he was yet twice called to the PRESIDENCY of the UNI|TED STATES, and twice he obeyed the &s;ummons. The high approbation with which he executed this office, as well as the con&s;picuous part which he acted in the celebrated Congre&s;s that conduct|ed us to independence, and in the Convention
<PB N="11" REF="037963_0010_10102E00A9F7AED0">
which framed our excellent con&s;titution, are fully atte&s;ted. None had it in his power to do &s;o much towards reconciling the jarring in|tere&s;ts and &s;entiments of the different &s;tates, and &s;tilling their political &s;torms, as the man who not only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, but was univer&s;ally e&s;teemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s, the highe&s;t degree of wi&s;|dom and integrity, added to the mo&s;t con|&s;ummate prudence. To his management, therefore, in war and in peace, under the guid|ance of a gracious Providence, it is in a great mea&s;ure to be attributed, that we this day &s;it with &s;o much tranquillity, each under his vine and under his fig-tree, in the enjoyment of both civil and religious liberty.</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ings, therefore, which GOD has conferred upon us, by means of this great and good man, are not merely of a civil nature; but, as it was &s;aid of JEHOIADA, &s;o it may be &s;aid of WASHINGTON, that <HI>"He did good&mdash;both towards GOD, and towards his hou&s;e."</HI> The frame of our civil government, and the liberty which under it we enjoy, which have been &s;o much pro|moted by him, are circum&s;tances highly favorable to the intere&s;t of religion.&mdash;A government &s;ome|thing &s;imilar to ours, &s;eems to be e&s;&s;ential to the
<PB N="12" REF="037963_0011_10102E05096209E0">
GLORIOUS REIGN OF the MESSIAH, which we are looking for with earne&s;t expectation. We are a&s;&s;ured from the prophecies of the old and new te&s;tament, that the time is coming, <HI>when the earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of the LORD; when they &s;hall not hurt nor de&s;troy in all GOD's holy mountain; when his watchmen, his mini&s;ter|ing &s;ervants, &s;hall &s;ee eye to eye, and lift up the voice and &s;ing together; and when there &s;hall be one fold, and one</HI> SHEPHERD. Now, is it po&s;&s;i|ble, that &s;uch increa&s;e of divine knowledge, &s;uch perfect peace, and &s;uch concert and har|mony in religion can ever take place, &s;o long as civil governments, whether Chri&s;tian, Anti|chri&s;tian, Mahometan or Pagan, take upon them to pre&s;cribe what religion people &s;hall profe&s;s, and compel them to wor&s;hip GOD, or their pretended gods, according to their &s;everal dic|tates? Certainly it is not. So certain is it then, that all religious e&s;tabli&s;hments by civil author|ity, and whatever el&s;e may hinder men from judging for them&s;elves in matters of religion, &s;hall be removed out of the way, and every man be permitted to wor&s;hip GOD agreeably to the dictates of his own con&s;cience, enlight|ened by the Holy Scriptures, and be protected in his religious as well as in his civil rights.
<PB N="13" REF="037963_0012_101021069E5D0E58">
Such is the &s;tate of things under our happy gov|ernment; and &s;uch mu&s;t be the &s;tate of all the nations of the earth, before the <HI>univer&s;al reign of the</HI> REDEEMER can take place. From &s;crip|ture prophecies, and from events by which they have been fulfilled, and by which they are dai|ly fulfilling before our eyes, we have rea&s;on to believe, that this long expected period is not very far di&s;tant. We may, therefore, look for|ward and exult in the pro&s;pect of the time when <HI>"the kingdoms of this world &s;hall become the kingdoms of our LORD and of his CHRIST,"</HI> and when JESUS &s;hall reign triumphantly, <HI>"from &s;ea to &s;ea, and from the river to the ends of the earth."</HI> And it mu&s;t afford us no &s;mall degree of plea&s;ure to reflect, that &s;o much pre|paration is made in our happy country for this glorious event, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our ci|vil and religious liberties.</P>
<P>NOW as GOD has honored our illu&s;trious CHIEF, by employing him &s;o &s;ignally in accom|pli&s;hing this important work; let us honor him this day, by rendering unfeigned thanks to the AUTHOR of all our ble&s;&s;ings, for rai&s;ing up among us &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a per&s;onage, and making him the in&s;trument of &s;uch ine&s;timable benefits.
<PB N="14" REF="037963_0013_10102E06B4F38EA8">
This is the manner of honoring him which be&s;t becomes us as Chri&s;tians, and be&s;t accords with the character of the decea&s;ed; who in both his public and private conduct, always manife&s;t|ed a deep &s;en&s;e of the &s;uperintendence of Di|vine Providence, and of his con&s;tant dependence on the Great Di&s;po&s;er of all events.</P>
<P>AND while we deplore his removal from us, let us learn by his example to acquie&s;ce in the wi&s;e di&s;po&s;als of Heaven, adopting the language of this excellent man, when, viewing from the oppo&s;ite bank of the Hud&s;on the capture of Fort Wa&s;hington, he lifted his hands and eyes towards heaven, and &s;aid, "FATHER, <HI>thy will be done."</HI> Piety was not the lea&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing trait in this great man's character. This it was that rendered him truly illu&s;trious, and gave him a decided pre-eminence above all the great men of the earth in whom this quality was wanting.</P>
<P>AND as we can no way honor him more high|ly than by imitating his pious example; &s;o there is no way by which we have &s;o fair a pro&s;pect of &s;ecuring to our&s;elves the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings which he has been the in&s;trument of procuring.
<PB N="15" REF="037963_0014_10102E08444477E0">
It is a great error to &s;uppo&s;e, that the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e will always en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s, and the in|ju&s;tice of our adver&s;aries defeat their pur|po&s;e. For if by our crimes we forfeit our rights and privileges, we may be deprived of them by being &s;uffered to fall under the power of the mo&s;t unrighteous enemies. It is only while we humbly <HI>"walk with GOD,"</HI> and <HI>"put our tru&s;t under the &s;hadow of his wings,"</HI> that we may look for his gracious protection. Then indeed, we may confidently hope, that he will, from time to time, rai&s;e up to us &s;uch Coun&s;ellors, and &s;uch Defenders as our exigencies may require. He who could furni&s;h America with a WASH|INGTON, can never be at a lo&s;s for &s;ervants qualified to execute his beneficent purpo&s;es towards them who place their confidence in him. On his Almighty arm be all our depend|ence, and for every deliverance, and for every &s;alvation which we may experience, to him be all the glory. AND LET ALL THE PEOPLE SAY, AMEN.</P>
