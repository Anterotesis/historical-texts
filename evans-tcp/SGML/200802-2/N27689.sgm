<Q>I u&s;e this new addre&s;s, as I &s;tand before you now in a new character, and upon a new occa&s;ion. In my at|tempt to perform the ta&s;k you have a&s;&s;igned me, I feel my&s;elf &s;upported by a confidence in your well-known candor.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS day is remarkable. This day, &s;ixty-eight years ago, had the honour to witne&s;s the nativ|ity of one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of the human race. You will readily conceive, that the reference applies to the late General GEORGE WASHINGTON, who&s;e memory is ble&s;&s;ed. This day, therefore, has often been celebrated, in many of our cities and towns, in commemoration of that happy event.&mdash;Some of you, I pre&s;ume, have &s;een the lively im|pre&s;&s;ive emblems of publick joy di&s;played upon that occa&s;ion, and have partaken in the high-wrought affection.</P>
<P>HAPPY were it for us! happy were it for the whole nation! were this the only object of publick attention, this day. But the ca&s;e is greatly other|wi&s;e.
<PB N="6" REF="036906_0005_100B31B6584C46A0">
The harp is now turned to mourning; for that venerable and illu&s;trious Per&s;onage has lately clo&s;ed his eyes upon the light of life, and is now no more.</P>
<P>ON the 14th December la&s;t, a regretful day now to be adopted into the gloomy annals of mortality, his invaluable life was taken from the earth.</P>
<P>THE winged tidings, as if an ho&s;t had peri&s;hed, or a whole city ru&s;hed to ruin, pervaded the whole land. The bereaved nation is now &s;een, as the Prophet &s;aw the tents of Cu&s;han, in affliction; or, as were the cho&s;en tribes in the wilderne&s;s, lamenting the death of their Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>THIS day, &s;o often the joyful anniver&s;ary of his birth, is now, by authority, made &s;acred to his fu|neral honours. Alas for the day! <HI>Quantum mutatus ab illo!</HI> How is the &s;cene changed! Yet, the nature of this changeful world con&s;idered, perfectly in order.</P>
<P>SHOULD the propriety of the publick &s;olemnities of this day be demanded, while the publick lo&s;s, and the &s;ublime virtues of our a&s;cended Patriot, in &s;ol|emn a&s;&s;emblies, re&s;ound from the lips of a thou&s;and &s;elected orators; I &s;hall make &s;ome reply.</P>
<P>MOURNING for the dead, with funeral re&s;pect for the great and good, e&s;pecially &s;uch as have been great and publick benefactors, is a dictate of nature, ex-emplified in the practice of all nations, the di&s;ciples of Divine Revelation not excepted; and appears to
<PB N="7" REF="036906_0006_100B31B858708010">
be countenanced, at lea&s;t, by Revelation it&s;elf. The principle, like other natural principles, has been in|dulged to exce&s;s; has often been the parent of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities, and even of abominable idolatries. Hence, mere frail mortals have been deified; and &s;ome of the mo&s;t polluted wretches, &s;ainted. La&s;t re&s;pects to virtuous de&s;erving character, when no|thing more can be done, are often overdone. This is no rea&s;on that nothing of the kind &s;hould be at|tempted. If any thing be due from the living to the dead, it is an honourable remembrance. Who lives, and wi&s;hes not that his honours, if he has any, may outlive him? Such a principle, under due re|&s;traint, is not without its u&s;e; is a &s;timulus to the acqui&s;ition of per&s;onal accompli&s;hments and merit; a motive, among greater motives, to a virtuous and honourable practice. More virtue exi&s;ts, we pre|&s;ume, becau&s;e it is known, that its prai&s;e &s;hall &s;ur|vive its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. What le&s;s than to check vice, and encourage virtue, did the wi&s;e king of I&s;rael intend, when he uttered that memorable aphori&s;m? "The memory of the ju&s;t is ble&s;&s;ed; but the name of the wicked &s;hall rot."</P>
<P>As Pagan, Jewi&s;h, and Chri&s;tian princes, poten|tates, heroes, &amp;c. have been publickly honoured by their funeral rites; who will deny the pre&s;ent claim, in behalf of our WASHINGTON, to be ju&s;t?</P>
<P>I PRESUME, it is now the wi&s;h of this whole au|dience, mo&s;t certainly it is mine, that I were able
<PB N="8" REF="036906_0007_100B31B9DB021BB8">
to do ju&s;tice to a character, &s;o much the ornament and boa&s;t of our nation. But, in&s;tead of attempt|ing to de&s;cribe a character &s;o exalted, I will honour him yet more another way; by acknowledging it is above my reach. To this &s;mall tribute of prai&s;e (for &s;mall indeed it is) I will add that which is far greater; by announcing to you, that others, con|&s;ummate Eulogi&s;ts, who have acted the part before me, have confe&s;&s;ed the attempt to be de&s;perate.&mdash;What de&s;cription of the fun, when &s;hining in his meridian lu&s;tre, &s;hall improve the intuitive idea of his &s;plendor? That mu&s;t be a fair hand, that touches the driven &s;now without injury to its native white|ne&s;s. Suffice it for me further to &s;ay, that on every pronunciation of the glorious name, GENERAL WASHINGTON, rides forth the idea of a bright a&s;|&s;emblage, if I may not &s;ay, the aggregate, of virtues.</P>
<P>I SHALL attempt, however, with great and com|prehen&s;ive brevity, and as great diffidence, to retrace the mighty and beneficent deeds of one, who has been &s;o much the organ of &s;alvation and ble&s;&s;ings to his native country, and our own.</P>
<P>SINCE the day of &s;ome, and before the day of others, of us, the now United States of America were appendages of the Briti&s;h nation. The parent &s;tate cea&s;ed to govern them with affection, and for|ged political chains for them. Born free, and accu&s;|tomed to a liberal government, they revolted at the idea of &s;ubjugation. Coercive policy met their firm
<PB N="9" REF="036906_0008_100ADD25AC1BEE60">
united re&s;i&s;tance. Fleets and armies were employed again&s;t them. It was nece&s;&s;ary that an oppo&s;ing army &s;hould be rai&s;ed and organized. An important, but not difficult que&s;tion aro&s;e; Who &s;hall take the chief command? no doubt was long entertained. WASHINGTON was appointed. Not for filthy lucre, not from the pride of his heart, not to &s;upport a lawle&s;s faction, not to drive in &s;under the nations for conque&s;t or plunder; but "for the help of the Lord again&s;t the mighty;" for the help of his then oppre&s;&s;ed, already wounded, and bleeding country, he greatly aro&s;e, and accepted the awful charge.</P>
<P>WHAT followed is well known. He came; he fought; he conquered. Long time, with various &s;ucce&s;s, at the head of his brave republican legions, he oppo&s;ed the mighty invaders of our rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; tho&s;e who blockaded our harbours, rav|aged our coa&s;ts, burned our cities to a&s;hes, and &s;hed rivers of innocent blood. When the pro&s;pect dark|ened before him, de&s;pondency found him not; &s;uc|ce&s;s could not flatter him to abate his vigilance. As the fruits of his prowe&s;s, &s;o happily accompanied with prudence and per&s;everance, whole armies, one after another, became his mortified captives; and he unbuckled not his armour till all oppo&s;ition gave way before him; till he &s;aw the proud foe of hu|manity pro&s;trated and trembling under the point of his &s;word, and his native land a quiet habitation. Then, and not before, he re&s;igned the augu&s;t com|mand, and retired to the common rank of a citizen.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="036906_0009_100B31BD9A29BD18">
IT was not long, before the united voice of the nation called him forth from his beloved retirement, to pre&s;ide over the realms his valor had &s;aved.&mdash;This honour was done him a &s;econd time; a third time was prevented only by his ab&s;olute refu&s;al, for rea&s;ons he adduced. By his admini&s;trations, as Chief Magi&s;trate, it was made evident, that nature had formed him for the &s;ceptre, as well as for the &s;word.</P>
<P>THE nation being threatened again with the ca|lamity of war, to whom was it natural for them to look for protection, under God, but to their veteran Hero, who had &s;o recently conducted them to vic|tory and peace? The &s;olicitations of Government, therefore, prevailed with him to re&s;ume the conquer|ing &s;word, and take the command of the precau|tionary forces. Under the honours of this appoint|ment, at the command of the Arbiter of life, to which the highe&s;t mu&s;t &s;ubmit, he made his mighty exit, and retired, all are confident, to peaceful regions.</P>
<P>How imperfect the review! Draw upon your memories, call up faithful hi&s;tory, to &s;upply the pre&s;ent lack of narration. From the&s;e &s;ources of in|formation it will appear, that &s;uch were his virtues and talents, and &s;o directly and &s;ucce&s;sfully exerted for the benefit of his generation, that he ro&s;e to fame by his own merits, and, foreign to his main object, attached to him&s;elf honours to an effulgence of glory. His prai&s;e is in all the nation; it &s;urpa&s;&s;es
<PB N="11" REF="036906_0010_100B31C011B514C0">
her limits; and, like the rays of the prince of day, is gone out into all the world. It re-echoes to us from every enlightened people. It will progre&s;s with civilization, till both embrace the ends of the earth. And his name &s;hall endure, as long as virtue and talents, employed for the be&s;t purpo&s;es, &s;hall command plaudits from a human tongue. We ex|pre&s;s our confidence of its perpetuity, by addre&s;&s;ing to him that ancient poetic line, as pertinent to the purpo&s;e as in its primary application;
<Q>Semper honos, nomenque tuum, laude&s;que manebunt.</Q>
Pardon the unknown tongue, and take the &s;en&s;e thus:
<Q>Forever live thy name, renown and prai&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>DESERVEDLY great as the publick mourning is, is there no con&s;olation?</P>
<LG>
<L>No grief &s;o great, but remedies are found;</L>
<L>There's balm in &s;tore to heal a nation's wound.</L>
</LG>
<P>IN behalf of our decea&s;ed benefactor, mourning, we pre&s;ume, is needle&s;s; tears would be wa&s;ted.&mdash;Why weep for the dead, who have accompli&s;hed every important purpo&s;e of life, and retired to their rewards? To his more publick character as a patriot, we are happy in being able to add, that he, who&s;e memory we celebrate as the Saviour of our country, was him&s;elf a di&s;ciple of the Saviour of the world; believed in, and profe&s;&s;ed, the Chri&s;tian Religion;
<PB N="12" REF="036906_0011_100B31C194A48BC0">
was in church-fellow&s;hip; and attended the &s;acred ordinances; and, in his more private walks, order|ed his &s;teps by the heavenly rules and maxims of the go&s;pel. Such a one mu&s;t have happine&s;s &s;ecured. Earth, bad as it is, cannot deny it him; death can|not deprive him of it; the eternal world, mo&s;t cer|tainly, mu&s;t improve it to perfection.</P>
<LG>
<L>For Vernon's mount, that with a palace vies,</L>
<L>He now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es heavenly paradi&s;e:</L>
<L>Elate in honours which out&s;hine, outlive</L>
<L>The fading plaudits fellow-mortals give:</L>
<L>Anointed high above his fellows <HI>there,</HI></L>
<L>As much as he &s;urpa&s;s'd the vulgar <HI>here.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>THE publick lo&s;s we ju&s;tly deplore. The breach is wide like the &s;ea. But, con&s;olation offers it&s;elf to us from the highe&s;t &s;ource. We piou&s;ly exult in the language of the Prophet, in a dark day; "Art not thou from everla&s;ting, O Lord our God, our holy One? We &s;hall not die," as a nation, though WASHINGTON, &s;o long and &s;o much the breath of our no&s;trils, be taken from us. Be we but a vir|tuous people, and the Lord will provide for us. With him is the re&s;idue of the &s;pirit. When Mo&s;es the &s;ervant of the Lord was dead, He rai&s;ed up Jo&s;hua, to lead the cho&s;en race to their de&s;tination. Nor are we left in a &s;ituation only to hope again&s;t probability, &s;o long as there is an ADAMS, a JEFFER|SON, and others we could name; even an ho&s;t of patriots who &s;urvive, to watch over, defend, and
<PB N="13" REF="036906_0012_100B31C4057E6EE0">
improve the glorious fabric of our union and polity, according to the pattern that has been &s;hewed them from the Mount (Vernon).</P>
<P>AND may we not con&s;ole our&s;elves, in part, from the con&s;ideration of the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of literature in our nation? that the &s;cientific fountains will pro|vide for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of wi&s;e and faithful rulers, to go in and out before us; and of Generals too, to command our armies, &s;o long as the world around us &s;hall remain &s;o depraved and rapacious, as to make the art and occupation of war nece&s;&s;ary for defence.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;hall we prai&s;e our WASHINGTON, and neglect HIM who is higher than the highe&s;t? Herod made an oration to the people, and committed an error that proved fatal to the pompous orator him|&s;elf; "he gave not God the glory." And far be it from us, in imitation of a late refinement upon hea|theni&s;m, to addre&s;s our publick gratitude to our na|tional genius. We are not a&s;hamed to mention the name of the Lord, who rules in the kingdom of men; our hope in the day of evil; in the day of pro&s;perity, our &s;ong. Is WASHINGTON celebrated this day, as having been our political Father, our Ben|efactor, our Saviour? For this purpo&s;e God rai&s;ed him up, to &s;hew forth by him his mighty power, and his exten&s;ive goodne&s;s, before all the people.&mdash;He fore&s;aw our de&s;tinies, and fitted him exactly for our purpo&s;e: rai&s;ed him up in the right time: he
<PB N="14" REF="036906_0013_100B31C6989B0E98">
was of proper age the moment his &s;ervices were wanted; nearly the age of Mo&s;es when he entered upon his divine legation, to liberate the po&s;terity of Jacob, from the oppre&s;&s;ions of the tyrant of Egypt. The Creator of man united in him &s;trength of body, and vigour of mind; formed him by nature and edu|cation for his work; made him impregnable to the force of corruption, &s;hould the proffered price of his fidelity be the greate&s;t, and lavi&s;hed upon him the talents of war and of government. The Pre&s;erver of man &s;trengthened his warlike arm, and covered his anointed head in the day of battle; not an hair of his head fell to the ground; nor was a drop of his blood &s;hed by the &s;word of the enemy. Happy for us! the &s;ame man, WASHINGTON, had, and re|tained, the Chief Command of our forces, from the beginning to the end of the memorable conflict.&mdash;The honoured in&s;trument de&s;erves an honourable remembrance; but the ultimate prai&s;e mu&s;t take an higher direction, even to the God of armies and battles, who turneth the victory on which &s;ide he plea&s;eth. Thus we "render unto Ce&s;ar the things that are Ce&s;ar's; and unto God the things that are God's."</P>
<P>LOOK now for a reward of your further attention, in a concluding word of advice.</P>
<P>DO we honour the memory of General WASH|INGTON this day, as having been our benefactor, and &s;o much the in&s;trument of our national freedom,
<PB N="15" REF="036906_0014_100B31C8ACEB09E8">
and pre&s;ent happy e&s;tabli&s;hment? Hence, the&s;e are benefits; benefits to be appreciated, defended, and improved. He has left us in a &s;ituation mo&s;t friend|ly to the acqui&s;ition and enjoyment of publick and private property; the cultivation of every virtue; and the practice of pure and undefiled religion, which is under a divine promi&s;e of this life, and the life to come. Therefore, let us &s;tand fa&s;t, let us &s;tand right in, and prize and improve, the liberty with which we are made free, by the &s;word of the LORD, and of WASHINGTON his faithful &s;er|vant.</P>
<P>YOU will now allow me to retire within my proper &s;phere, and act the preacher, &s;o far as to exhort all pre&s;ent, heedfully to attend to the voice that cries, "All fle&s;h is gra&s;s, and all the glory of man as the flower of the gra&s;s:" the &s;olemn voice of mortality, I mean, now become peculiarly impre&s;&s;ive, by the fall of this mighty one, this earthly god, who has died like another man, and fallen like one of the princes. In regard to death, the high and low, the illu&s;trious and ob&s;cure together, &s;tand on equal ground; there is no pre-eminence. "The &s;mall and the great are there"; "and there is no di&s;charge in that war." Let us fight the good fight of faith; and the reward will be, a crown of glory that &s;hall not fade.</P>
