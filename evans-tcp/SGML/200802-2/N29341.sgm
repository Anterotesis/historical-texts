<P>UNDER the deep impre&s;&s;ion of that great event which has clad a nation in mourn|ing, you will feel the propriety of my addre&s;&s;ing you, in the words of David, on the death of the General of the armies of I&s;rael, 2d <HI>Samuel,</HI> iii. 38.
<Q>A GREAT MAN IS FALLEN.</Q></P>
<P>NEVER could this &s;entence be applied with greater ju&s;tice, to any natural de&s;cendant of our primitive parents, than in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. Every heart a&s;&s;ents, whil&s;t awakened by his death, to melancholy reflection; our thoughts naturally run back to former periods, and retrace the nume|rous and exten&s;ive &s;ervices to his country and to mankind, by which the &s;ubject of our mourning obtained, and forever &s;ecured, to him&s;elf, a ju&s;t claim to greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>WE might here, with very little re&s;erve, adopt the language which our divine Saviour ap|plies to John the Bapti&s;t. <HI>"Among tho&s;e who are born of women hath not ari&s;en a greater than" our il|lu&s;trious WASHINGTON.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="039070_0005_10139596AF79AFC0">
BUT he is fallen&mdash;fallen a victim to death, that la&s;t enemy, that univer&s;al de&s;troyer of our &s;pecies, who&s;e &s;hafts level, without di&s;tinction, the great with the little, in the grave. Adored be the GOD of mercy, this la&s;t enemy &s;hall, in the end, be compelled to relea&s;e his captives, re&s;tore his prey, and be him&s;elf completely vanqui&s;hed, by Him who is higher than the highe&s;t, and greater than the greate&s;t of the children of men.</P>
<P>IN conformity to our text, we will

<ITEM>I. GIVE the general outlines of true great|ne&s;s, as it re&s;pects the character of man; and then,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. APPLY it to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, with &s;uitable improvement.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>ONE great, wi&s;e and benevolent de&s;ign is ap|parent, in all the works and ways of GOD: this leads us to the knowledge of his character, and to adore him as infinitely good, the fountain of being and of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. This affords us a &s;tandard by which we are to e&s;timate every &s;ubject pre&s;ented to our thoughts, whether in the material, animal, or rational world.</P>
<P>IT is not merely the diffu&s;ive light and warmth of the &s;un, the &s;alubrity of the air which we breathe, the verdure and fertility of the earth, with the numberle&s;s &s;ources of innocent and vir|tuous plea&s;ure, which he has opened to his ration|al offspring; but the painful di&s;cipline of affliction, by which he trains us for an happy immortality,
<PB N="9" REF="039070_0006_10139568CD4B59D0">
equally evidences the parental goodne&s;s of GOD, his affection for us, and that the end of all his di&s;|pen&s;ations is the happine&s;s of his univer&s;al family.</P>
<P>BY this &s;tandard we are to e&s;timate the value of every &s;ubject; and the characters of men ri&s;e to greatne&s;s, or &s;ink to contempt, in proportion as they are or are not qualified and di&s;po&s;ed to fur|ther the accompli&s;hment of this great de&s;ign of the benevolent Parent of the univer&s;e. When we apply this rule to rational and intelligent beings, we take into con&s;ideration what con&s;titutes the beauty and moral excellence of every action; it mu&s;t re&s;ult from inclination and choice.</P>
<P>WE thus a&s;&s;ign to all nature, and to all crea|tures, their proper place in our e&s;timation. Dif|ferent &s;hades of glory or of greatne&s;s are, as St. Paul ob&s;erves, annexed to the &s;un, the moon and the &s;tars; not becau&s;e they &s;hine with different de|grees of &s;plendour; but becau&s;e they tend, in dif|ferent degrees, to promote the comfort and hap|pine&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P>THE Saviour of the world founds greatne&s;s on &s;ervices performed. If any man will be great among you, let him be your &s;ervant&mdash;let him be the &s;ervant of all. On this he founds his own greatne&s;s&mdash;<HI>I am among you as one who &s;erves.</HI> Many qualifications, and many favourable circum&s;tances, mu&s;t unite in the man who ri&s;es to di&s;tingui&s;hed greatne&s;s in this way, and by &s;uch means as we have mentioned above.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="039070_0007_101395983552B220">
HE mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a vigorous, active and enter|pri&s;ing genius, capable of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and comprehen&s;ive views, of di&s;cerning at once what is proper to be done, and the be&s;t means for effect|ing his purpo&s;e. This &s;uperior genius mu&s;t be connected with a body equally vigorous, and which is capable, not only of &s;u&s;taining, but of &s;econding, the energies of the mind.&mdash;To this mu&s;t be added a form and addre&s;s, &s;uited at once to in&s;pire re&s;pect and to conciliate affection.&mdash;He mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s an high degree of &s;elf government, the control of his pa&s;&s;ions, his words and his ac|tions, that each, in its place, may be made to &s;ub|&s;erve his purpo&s;e. This &s;elf government mu&s;t be the effect of exalted piety towards God; follow|ed by the mo&s;t exten&s;ive good will to men, mea&s;ured and regulated by the different grades of &s;ocial, civil and dome&s;tic relation. The&s;e are &s;ome of the qualities which mu&s;t unite in forming the character of the truly great man.</P>
<P>BUT, in addition to the&s;e, there mu&s;t be an happy concurrence of circum&s;tances to call his talents and his virtues into action. Some theatre mu&s;t be opened to him, adapted to his capacity and equal to his views. He mu&s;t be called to act on an exten&s;ive &s;tage. The part a&s;&s;igned him, in the providence of God, mu&s;t be arduous and difficult; &s;uch as might terrify another, but is only &s;uited to call into action the &s;uperior powers with which he is entru&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="039070_0008_1013956A52F38448">
THE exerci&s;e of the greate&s;t talents, with the concurrence of every favourable circum&s;tance, is not always followed with &s;ucce&s;s, which it is not in mortals to in&s;ure. The exertions of the good man, in the cau&s;e of human happine&s;s, ought to be acknowledged, though un&s;ucce&s;sful; they can|not, in the end, lo&s;e their reward from Him, who&s;e judgments are righteous altogether. But, with men, &s;ucce&s;s is wi&s;dom. In order, therefore, to render a man great in the view of the world, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the exerci&s;e of the a&s;&s;emblage of virtues, and the improvement of the happy concurrence of circum&s;tances mentioned above, &s;hould be followed with the accompli&s;hment of &s;ome purpo&s;e of exten&s;ive and la&s;ting utility to mankind.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ucce&s;s, in&s;tead of being attended or fol|lowed with the genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> pride of conque&s;t, or an increa&s;ing fondne&s;s for the wealth, pomp and &s;plendour of this world, mu&s;t produce effects di|rectly the contrary, and afford an opportunity for exhibiting an example of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, &s;elf-de|nial and humility, equally extraordinary, and wor|thy of admiration, as the &s;ervices performed.</P>
<P>To give to greatne&s;s effects &s;till more di&s;tinct, exten&s;ive and la&s;ting, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to have been equally u&s;eful, by the exerci&s;e of the &s;ame exalted talents in different departments; and that his exertions, &s;ucce&s;sful in each, have pro|cured new ble&s;&s;ings on his country and on man|kind; and con&s;equently thrown new rays of
<PB N="12" REF="039070_0009_1013959AA78464E0">
greatne&s;s or of glory around the character of our illu&s;trious mortal.</P>
<P>To complete the picture, which we meant to draw, of human greatne&s;s, to give it all the force and render it as impre&s;&s;ive as po&s;&s;ible on the pub|lic mind, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e this di&s;tingui&s;hed char|acter is withdrawn from our &s;ight, at a period when it &s;hone with its full &s;plendour, ere the &s;hades of evening had in any perceptible degree dimmed the lu&s;tre of its rays, or the debilitating influence of years had le&s;&s;ened our veneration for or expectations from it. In that ca&s;e, whil&s;t we follow the illu&s;trious &s;pirit to the realms of light and glory, we are ready to lament for our&s;elves and our country in the language of Eli&s;ha, when he beheld the a&s;cen&s;ion of Elijah, "<HI>My father, my father, the chariot of I&s;rael, and the hor&s;emen thereof.</HI>"</P>
<P>SUCH are the requi&s;ites to true greatne&s;s of character in man. It admits of infinite varieties, indeed, from the lowly cottager, who acts his lit|tle part in ob&s;curity, confined to the dome&s;tic cir|cle, to him who figures in the view of admiring nations, and is in&s;trumental of obtaining the mo&s;t rich and la&s;ting ble&s;&s;ings for his country, and for mankind.</P>
<P>How widely different is this from what the world has been u&s;ed to e&s;timate as greatne&s;s, and to di&s;tingui&s;h with its loude&s;t applau&s;e! A wan|ton triumph over all that is dear and valuable to man, the peace, order, liberty and happine&s;s of &s;ociety; a throne to which the a&s;piring &s;on of
<PB N="13" REF="039070_0010_1013956BF4D98698">
pride has waded, through rivers of human blood, or climbed over heaps of &s;laughtered fellow crea|tures, the &s;plendour of which is &s;upported by the groans and tears of oppre&s;&s;ed millions. Cur&s;ed of the GOD of mercy is &s;uch de&s;tructive great|ne&s;s; it well de&s;erves the fate a&s;&s;igned it by the prophet&mdash;"<HI>Hell is moved to receive it.</HI>"</P>
<P>THE character which we have drawn is in di|rect oppo&s;ition to this havoc of lawle&s;s ambition; it repre&s;ents an earthly god, imitating the exam|ple of the GOD of heaven, in diffu&s;ing ble&s;&s;ings on all around him.</P>
<P>YOU have anticipated me in applying this char|acter to the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent mourning. Such was our country's favourite &s;on; and whil&s;t we behold her, with downca&s;t eyes, weeping over the urn which contains his &s;acred a&s;hes, we approve her grief, and &s;ay, Weep on; never could tears flow for a cau&s;e more ju&s;t.</P>
<P>ALL the various qualities and circum&s;tances mentioned above, are combined in the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent mournful admiration.</P>
<P>A MIND capable of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive views; active as light; at once embracing a variety of objects, comparing them, and forming the mo&s;t accurate judgment on the whole; a form and addre&s;s, adapted at once to plea&s;e and command re&s;pect; a perfect ma&s;tery over his pa&s;&s;ions, calm and collected in the mo&s;t trying &s;it|uations; a profound &s;en&s;e of the being, perfection and providence of GOD, and of the nece&s;&s;ary de|pendence
<PB N="14" REF="039070_0011_1013959C3125AA40">
of man upon the great Author of his ex|i&s;tence, for individual and for &s;ocial happine&s;s; an highly cultivated &s;en&s;e of moral relations, the obli|gations and duties re&s;ulting from them; purity of heart and life; an ardent, but rational affection for his country and for mankind, are &s;ome of the natural, moral and religious qualities, with which he was enriched and adorned, and which rendered him in&s;trumental, in the hand of GOD, of per|forming the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;ervices, the re&s;ult of which is, the mo&s;t &s;olid and la&s;ting greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT, enriched as he was with all the endow|ments mentioned above, they might have been exerci&s;ed in promoting the intere&s;t of &s;ome ob&s;cure village, confined to a family, or wa&s;ted like the virtues of the reclu&s;e within the walls of a cloi&s;|ter, had not the providence of GOD &s;o di&s;po&s;|ed his lot in the world, as to call his talents and virtues into action, on a &s;tage &s;o exten&s;ive and con|&s;picuous, as that admiring millions &s;hould at once witne&s;s the extent of his &s;ervices, and be filled with plea&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;plendour of his great|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>HIS military talents were exerci&s;ed in arduous enterprize at an early period; and when, as yet but a youth, it is a well known fact, that his more than manly prudence, had it been li&s;tened to, would have pre&s;erved a veteran Briti&s;h General from the mo&s;t fatal di&s;after.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to Braddock's defeat.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHEN war commenced between this country and our oppre&s;&s;ive parent State, WASHINGTON
<PB N="15" REF="039070_0012_101395702EF10B48">
was the man to whom a propitious Providence di|rected the eyes of his country for her defence and deliverance. He &s;oon reduced our armies from confu&s;ion to order; economized our &s;canty mili|tary &s;tores, and in a mea&s;ure &s;upplied the de|ficiency by his wi&s;dom and prudence.</P>
<P>TIME will not permit us to follow this illu&s;tri|ous father of our revolution, through that admi|rable train of events which a&s;toni&s;hed the world, and terminated in the complete vindication of our liberty, and e&s;tabli&s;hment of our independence and peace, we tru&s;t, on a ba&s;is which &s;hall la&s;t with time it&s;elf.</P>
<P>NEVER could we have had any &s;uitable concep|tion of the worth of WASHINGTON, had we not been favoured with his letters, which breathe at once the greatne&s;s of his views, the ardour of his affection for his country, and the re&s;olute firmne&s;s and per&s;everance of his &s;oul. When retiring, through the Jer&s;eys, in the greate&s;t apparent di&s;tre&s;s, followed by a powerful and exulting enemy, not a &s;ingle word do we hear of di&s;couragement, much le&s;s did he de&s;pair of the Commonwealth. He retired with dignity, with his eye &s;teadily fixed on his enemy, and the fir&s;t moment their inatten|tion afforded opportunity, he turned the torrent of war on his pur&s;uers, and, by repeated &s;trokes, humbled their pride and re-animated our hopes.</P>
<P>"GOD," &s;aid a wi&s;e ancient, "is never ab&s;ent where prudence pre&s;ides." How forcibly is this verified in the example before us. Prudence pre|&s;ided
<PB N="16" REF="039070_0013_1013959E09139BC0">
in the coun&s;els of WASHINGTON, and Heaven, almo&s;t by miracle, crowned his efforts with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>How do our hearts bleed, for this be&s;t and greate&s;t of men, when we read that he freely ex|po&s;ed him&s;elf to the cen&s;ure of his countrymen, by hiding from them the weakne&s;s of their own army, le&s;t it &s;hould come to the knowledge of their enemies.</P>
<P>THUS the wi&s;e parent con&s;ults the intere&s;t of his children, at the hazard of their di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t &s;cene, in this great military drama, was worthy the preceding acts, and equally af|fecting. With what inde&s;cribable dignity did the Hero retire, when he had accompli&s;hed the wi&s;h of his country, to enjoy the rewards of his exalted virtues in the &s;hades of &s;olitude.</P>
<P>BUT, at his country's call, he once more quits his beloved retirement, to pre&s;ide in that Convention which formed a Con&s;titution of Gov|ernment; at once the boa&s;t of the American States, and the admiration of other nations.</P>
<P>WITH what inimitable mode&s;ty did he ac|cept the fir&s;t Pre&s;idency in compliance with the united voice of his country, to him ever &s;acred. The &s;ame greatne&s;s marked his character in civil as in military life. He held the balance of inde|pendence with a &s;teady hand, and taught us a le&s;|&s;on of the greate&s;t importance, to con&s;ider our&s;elves as Americans, and to di&s;dain foreign influence.</P>
<P>THE legacy he bequeathed us, when he re|tired from the chair of government, is worthy to
<PB N="17" REF="039070_0014_10139572A3C0FFF8">
be written in letters of gold, or, rather, to be in|&s;cribed on the hearts of an enlightened, free, and grateful people. He was &s;till our &s;hield, our re|&s;ort and hope, under Providence, in the day of our trouble; and whil&s;t WASHINGTON lived, his life &s;eemed to be the pledge of our &s;afety and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE time and the manner of his death, like every circum&s;tance of his life, are adapted &s;trong|ly to impre&s;s the public mind. His &s;un &s;et ere the rays of its lu&s;tre were dimmed with age. He has quitted the &s;tage with the unimpaired admira|tion of his country and mankind.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the PEOPLE of the UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE period for a new election of a citizen, to admini&s;ter the executive government of the United States, being not far di&s;tant, and the time actually arrived, when your thoughts mu&s;t be employed in de&s;ignating the per&s;on, who is to be clothed with that important tru&s;t, it appears to me proper, e&s;pecially as it may conduce to a more di&s;tinct expre&s;&s;ion of the public voice, that I &s;hould now appri&s;e you of the re&s;olution I have formed, to decline being con&s;idered among the number of tho&s;e, out of whom a choice is to be made.</P>
<P>I beg you, at the &s;ame time, to do me the ju&s;tice to be a&s;&s;ured, that this re&s;olution has not been ta|ken without a &s;trict regard to all the con&s;iderations appertaining to the relation, which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing
<PB N="20" REF="039070_0016_101395A16707D240">
the tender of &s;ervice, which &s;ilence in my &s;ituation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future intere&s;t; no deficiency of grateful re&s;pect for your pa&s;t kindne&s;s: but am &s;upported by a full conviction that the &s;tep is com|patible with both.</P>
<P>The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which your &s;uffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform &s;acrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what appeared to be your de&s;ire. I con&s;tantly hoped, that it would have been much earlier in my power, con&s;i&s;tently with motives, which I was not at liberty to di&s;regard, to return to that re|tirement, from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The &s;trength of my inclination to do this, previous to the la&s;t election, had even led to the preparation of an addre&s;s to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical po&s;ture of our affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of per&s;ons entitled to my confi|dence, impelled me to abandon the idea.</P>
<P>I rejoice, that the &s;tate of your concerns, exter|nal as well as internal, no longer renders the pur|&s;uit of inclination incompatible with the &s;entiment of duty, or propriety; and am per&s;uaded, whatever partiality may be retained for my &s;ervices, that, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of our country, you will not di&s;approve my determination to retire.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ions, with which I fir&s;t undertook the arduous tru&s;t, were explained on the proper oc|ca&s;ion. In the di&s;charge of this tru&s;t, I will only &s;ay, that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and admini&s;tration of the government, the be&s;t exertions of which a very falli|ble judgment was capable. Not uncon&s;cious, in the
<PB N="21" REF="039070_0017_10139575E0209C00">
out&s;et, of the inferiority of my qualifications, expe|rience, in my own eyes, perhaps &s;till more in the eyes of others, has &s;trengthened the motives to di&s;|&s;idence of my&s;elf; and every day the increa&s;ing weight of years admoni&s;hes me more and more, that the &s;hade of retirement is as nece&s;&s;ary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any cir|cum&s;tances have given peculiar value to my &s;er|vices, they were temporary, I have the con&s;olation to believe, that, while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political &s;cene, patrioti&s;m does not for|bid it.</P>
<P>In looking forward to the moment, which is in|tended to terminate the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to &s;u&s;pend the deep ac|knowledgment of that debt of gratitude, which I owe to my beloved country, for the many honours it has conferred upon me; &s;till more for the &s;ted|fa&s;t confidence with which it has &s;upported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manife&s;ting my inviolable attachment, by &s;ervices faithful and per&s;evering, though in u&s;efulne&s;s une|qual to my zeal. If benefits have re&s;ulted to our country from the&s;e &s;ervices, let it always be remem|bered to your prai&s;e, and as an in&s;tructive example in our annals, that under circum&s;tances in which the pa&s;&s;ions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mi&s;lead&mdash;amid&s;t appearances &s;ometimes dubi|ous&mdash;vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune often di&s;couraging&mdash;in &s;ituations in which, not unfrequently, want of &s;ucce&s;s has countenanced the &s;pirit of critici&s;m&mdash;the con|&s;tancy of your &s;upport was the e&s;&s;ential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the plans, by which they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I &s;hall carry it with me to my grave, as a &s;trong incitement to uncea&s;ing vows, that Heaven

<P>HERE, perhaps, I ought to &s;top. But a &s;olicitude for your welfare, which cannot end but with my life, and the apprehen&s;ion of danger, natural to that &s;olicitude, urge me, on an occa&s;ion like the pre&s;ent, to offer to your &s;olemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent review, &s;ome &s;enti|ments, which are the re&s;ult of much reflection, of no incon&s;iderable ob&s;ervation, and which appear to me all-important to the permanency of your felici|ty as a people. The&s;e will be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only &s;ee in them the di&s;intere&s;ted warnings of a parting friend, who can po&s;&s;ibly have no per&s;onal motive to bias his coun&s;el. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your indulgent reception of my &s;entiments on a former and not di&s;&s;imilar occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is nece&s;&s;ary to fortify or confirm the attach|ment.</P>
<P>The unity of government, which con&s;titutes you one people, is al&s;o now dear to you. It is ju&s;tly

&s;o; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence; the &s;upport of your tranquillity at home, your peace abroad; of your &s;afety; of your pro&s;perity; of that very liberty which you &s;o highly prize. But, as it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that from different cau&s;es and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your political fortre&s;s, again&s;t which the batteries of internal and exter|nal enemies will be mo&s;t con&s;tantly and actively (though often covertly and in&s;idiou&s;ly) directed, it is of infinite moment that you &s;hould properly e&s;timate the immen&s;e value of your National Union, to your collective and individual happine&s;s; that you &s;hould cheri&s;h a cordial, habitual and immove|able attachment to it; accu&s;toming your&s;elves to think and &s;peak of it as of the palladium of your political &s;afety and pro&s;perity; watching for its pre&s;ervation with jealous anxiety; di&s;countenan|cing whatever may &s;ugge&s;t even a &s;u&s;picion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the fir&s;t dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the re&s;t, or to enfeeble the &s;acred ties which now link to|gether the various parts.</P>
<P>For this, you have every inducement of &s;ympathy and intere&s;t. Citizens, by birth or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to con|centrate your affections. The name of AMERICAN, which belongs to you, in your national capacity, mu&s;t always exalt the ju&s;t pride of patrioti&s;m, more than any appellation derived from local di&s;crimi|nations. With &s;light &s;hades of difference, you have the &s;ame religion, manners, habits and polit|ical principles. You have, in a common cau&s;e,
<PB N="24" REF="039070_0020_101395A648710E78">
fought and triumphed together; the independence and liberty you po&s;&s;e&s;s are the work of joint coun|cils, and joint efforts, of common dangers, &s;uffer|ings and &s;ucce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But the&s;e con&s;iderations, however powerfully they addre&s;s them&s;elves to your &s;en&s;ibility, are greatly out-weighed by tho&s;e which apply more immediately to your intere&s;t.&mdash;Here every portion of our country finds the mo&s;t commanding motives for carefully guarding and pre&s;erving the union of the whole.</P>
<P>The North, in an unre&s;trained intercour&s;e with the South, protected by the equal laws of a com|mon government, finds in the productions of the latter, great additional re&s;ources of maritime and commercial enterprize, and precious materials of manufacturing indu&s;try. The South, in the &s;ame intercour&s;e, benefiting by the agency of the North, &s;ees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its own channels the &s;eamen of the North, it finds its particular nav|igation invigorated; and while it contributes, in different ways, to nouri&s;h and increa&s;e the general ma&s;s of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime &s;trength, to which it|&s;elf is unequally adapted. The Ea&s;t, in a like in|tercour&s;e with the We&s;t, already finds, and, in the progre&s;&s;ive improvement of interior communica|tions, by land and water, will more and more find, a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad, or manufactures at home. The We&s;t derives from the Ea&s;t &s;upplies requi&s;ite to its growth and comfort; and, what is perhaps of &s;till greater con&s;equence, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity owe the &s;ecure enjoyment of indi&s;pen&s;able outlets for its own productions to the weighty influence, and the
<PB N="25" REF="039070_0021_1013957C9ABF7538">
future maritime &s;trength of the Atlantic &s;ide of the Union, directed by an indi&s;&s;oluble community of intere&s;t as one nation. Any other tenure, by which the We&s;t can hold this e&s;&s;ential advantage, whether derived from its own &s;eparate &s;trength, or from an apo&s;tate and unnatural connexion with any foreign power, mu&s;t be intrin&s;ically precarious.</P>
<P>While, then, every part of our country thus feels an immediate and particular intere&s;t in Union, all the parts combined cannot fail to find, in the united ma&s;s of means and efforts, greater &s;trength, greater re&s;ource, proportionably greater &s;ecurity from ex|ternal danger, a le&s;s frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is of mo&s;t ine&s;|timable value! they mu&s;t derive from Union an exemption from tho&s;e broils and wars between them&s;elves, which &s;o frequently afflict neighbour|ing countries, not tied together by the &s;ame gov|ernment; which their own rival&s;hips alone would be &s;ufficient to produce, but which oppo&s;ite foreign alliances, attachments and intrigues would &s;timu|late and embitter. Hence, likewi&s;e, they will avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e overgrown military e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, which, under any form of government, are inau&s;picious to liberty, and which are to be re|garded as particularly ho&s;tile to Republican Liberty. In this &s;en&s;e it is, that your Union ought to be con|&s;idered as a main prop of your Liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the pre&s;|ervation of the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations &s;peak a per&s;ua&s;ive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the UNION as a primary object of patriotic de&s;ire. Is there a doubt, whether a common government can embrace &s;o large a &s;phere? Let experience &s;olve it. To li&s;ten to mere
<PB N="26" REF="039070_0022_101395A8BAD829C8">
&s;peculation, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, were criminal. We are authori&s;ed to hope, that a proper organization of the whole, with the auxiliary agency of govern|ments for the re&s;pective &s;ubdivi&s;ions, will afford a happy i&s;&s;ue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and full experiment. With &s;uch powerful and obvious motives to Union, affecting all parts of our country, while experiment &s;hall not have demon|&s;trated its impracticability, there will always be rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t the patrioti&s;m of tho&s;e, who in any quarter may endeavour to weaken its bands.</P>
<P>In contemplating the cau&s;es which may di&s;turb our Union, it occurs as matter of &s;erious concern, that any ground &s;hould have been furni&s;hed for characterizing parties, by geographical di&s;crimina|tions&mdash;<HI>Northern</HI> and <HI>Southern&mdash;Atlantic</HI> and <HI>We&s;tern;</HI> whence de&s;igning men may endeavour to excite a belief, that there is a real difference of local inter|e&s;ts and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence, within particular di&s;tricts, is to mi&s;repre&s;ent the opinions and aims of other di&s;|tricts. You cannot &s;hield your&s;elves too much again&s;t the jealou&s;ies and heart-burnings which &s;pring from the&s;e mi&s;repre&s;entations; they tend to render alien to each other tho&s;e who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our We&s;tern country have lately had a u&s;eful le&s;|&s;on on this head: They have &s;een, in the negocia|tion by the Executive, and in the unanimous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">tifi|cation by the Senate, of the treaty with Spain, and in the univer&s;al &s;atisfaction at that event, through|out the United States, a deci&s;ive proof how un|founded were the &s;u&s;picions, propagated among them, of a policy in the General Government and in the Atlantic States, unfriendly to their intere&s;ts in regard to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi: They have been wit|ne&s;&s;es
<PB N="27" REF="039070_0023_1013957E22C1FEB8">
to the formation of two treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which &s;ecure to them every thing they could de&s;ire, in re&s;pect to our foreign relations, towards confirming their pro&s;perity. Will it not be their wi&s;dom to rely, for the pre&s;ervation of the&s;e advantages, on the UNION by which they were procured? Will they not hence|forth be deaf to tho&s;e advi&s;ers, if &s;uch there are, who would &s;ever them from their brethren, and con|nect them with aliens?</P>
<P>To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the whole is indi&s;pen&s;able. No alliances, however &s;trict, between the parts, can be an adequate &s;ub&s;titute; they mu&s;t inevitably expe|rience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have experienced. Sen&s;ible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon your fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, by the adoption of a Con&s;titution of Government, better calculated than your former, for an intimate Union, and for the efficacious man|agement of your common concerns. This Govern|ment, the offspring of your own choice, uninflu|enced and unawed; adopted upon full inve&s;tigation and mature deliberation; completely free in its prin|ciples; in the di&s;tribution of its powers, uniting &s;e|curity with energy; and containing within it&s;elf a provi&s;ion for its own amendment, has a ju&s;t claim to your confidence and your &s;upport. Re&s;pect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquie&s;cence in its mea&s;ures, are duties enjoined by the funda|mental maxims of true liberty. The ba&s;is of our political &s;y&s;tems is the right of the people to make and to alter their con&s;titutions of government&mdash;But, the con&s;titutions which at any time exi&s;ts, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is &s;acredly obligatory upon all. The
<PB N="28" REF="039070_0024_101395AB8CB22328">
very idea of the power and the right of the people to e&s;tabli&s;h government, pre&s;uppo&s;es the duty of every individual to obey the e&s;tabli&s;hed government.</P>
<P>All ob&s;tructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and a&s;&s;ociations, under whatever plau|&s;ible character, with the real de&s;ign to direct, con|trol, counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the con&s;tituted authorities, are de&s;tructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tenden|cy. They &s;erve to organize faction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a &s;mall, but artful and enterpri&s;ing minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumph of different parties, to make the public admini&s;tration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of con&s;i&s;tent and whole&s;ome plans, di|ge&s;ted by common councils, and modified by mu|tual intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>However combinations, or a&s;&s;ociations, of the above de&s;cription, may now and then an&s;wer popu|lar ends, they are likely, in the cour&s;e of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cun|ning, ambitious, and unprincipled men, will be ena|bled to &s;ubvert the power of the people, and to u&s;urp for them&s;elves the reins of government; de&s;troying, afterwards, the very engines which have lifted them to unju&s;t dominion.</P>
<P>Towards the pre&s;ervation of your government, and the permanency of your pre&s;ent happy &s;tate, it is requi&s;ite, not only that you &s;teadily di&s;counte|nance irregular oppo&s;itions to its acknowledged authority, but al&s;o that you re&s;i&s;t, with care, the &s;pirit of innovation upon its principles, however &s;pecious the pretexts. One method of a&s;&s;ault may
<PB N="29" REF="039070_0025_101395ADF9200600">
be to effect, in the forms of the Con&s;titution, alter|ations which will impair the energy of the &s;y&s;tem, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time and habit are at lea&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary to fix the true character of gov|ernments, as of other human in&s;titutions; that ex|perience is the &s;ure&s;t &s;tandard, by which to te&s;t the real tendency of the exi&s;ting con&s;titution of a coun|try; that facility in changes, upon the credit of mere hypothe&s;is and opinion, expo&s;es to perpetual change, from the endle&s;s variety of hypothe&s;is and opinion; and remember, e&s;pecially, that for the ef|ficient management of your common intere&s;ts, in a country &s;o exten&s;ive as ours, a government of as much vigour as is con&s;i&s;tent with the perfect &s;ecu|rity of liberty, is indi&s;pen&s;able. Liberty it&s;elf will find in &s;uch a government, with powers properly di&s;tributed and adju&s;ted, its &s;ure&s;t guardian. It is, indeed, little el&s;e than a name, where the govern|ment is too feeble to with&s;tand the enterpri&s;es of faction, to confine each member of the &s;ociety with|in the limits pre&s;cribed by the laws, and to main|tain all in the &s;ecure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of per&s;on and property.</P>
<P>I have already intimated to you, the danger of parties in a &s;tate, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical di&s;criminations. Let me now take a more comprehen&s;ive view, and warn you, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, again&s;t the baneful effects of the &s;pirit of party, generally.</P>
<P>This &s;pirit, unfortunately, is in&s;eparable from our nature, having its root in the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;|&s;ions of the human mind. It exi&s;ts, under different &s;hapes, in all governments, more or le&s;s &s;tifled, con|trolled, or repre&s;&s;ed; but in tho&s;e of the popular
<PB N="30" REF="039070_0026_101395ADF9200600">
form, it is &s;een in its greate&s;t rankne&s;s, and is truly their wor&s;t enemy.</P>
<P>The alternate domination of one faction over another, &s;harpened by the &s;pirit of revenge, natural to party di&s;&s;ention, which, in different ages and coun|tries, has perpetrated the mo&s;t horrid enormities, is it&s;elf a frightful de&s;poti&s;m: But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent de&s;poti&s;m. The di&s;orders and mi&s;eries, which re&s;ult, gradually incline the minds of men to &s;eek &s;ecurity and re|po&s;e in the ab&s;olute power of an individual; and, &s;ooner or later, the chief of &s;ome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this di&s;po&s;ition to the purpo&s;es of his own ele|vation, on the ruins of public liberty.</P>
<P>Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which neverthele&s;s ought not to be entirely out of &s;ight) the common and continual mi&s;chiefs of the &s;pirit of party are &s;ufficient to make it the intere&s;t and duty of a wi&s;e people to di&s;courage and re&s;train it.</P>
<P>It &s;erves always to di&s;tract the public councils, and enfeeble the public admini&s;tration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealou&s;ies and fal&s;e alarms; kindles the animo&s;ity of one part again&s;t another; and foments, occa&s;ionally, riot and in&s;ur|rection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated acce&s;s to the government it&s;elf, through the channels of party pa&s;&s;ions. Thus the policy and will of one country are &s;ubjected to the policy and will of another.</P>
<P>There is an opinion, that parties in free countries are u&s;eful checks up on the admini&s;tration of the gov|ernment, and &s;erve to keep alive the &s;pirit of liberty. This, within certain limits, is probably true; and
<PB N="31" REF="039070_0027_1013958265E0EE10">
in governments of a monarchical ca&s;t, patrioti&s;m may look with indulgence, if not with favour, upon the &s;pirit of party. But in tho&s;e of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a &s;pirit not to be encourged. From their natural tendency, it is certain, there will always be enough of that &s;pirit for every &s;alutary purpo&s;e: and there being con&s;tant danger of exce&s;s, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate and a&s;|&s;uage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bur&s;ting into a flame, le&s;t, in&s;tead of warming, it &s;hould con&s;ume.</P>
<P>It is important, likewi&s;e, that the habits of think|ing, in a free country, &s;hould in&s;pire caution in tho&s;e entru&s;ted with its admini&s;tration, to confine them|&s;elves within their re&s;pective con&s;titutional &s;pheres, avoiding, in the exerci&s;e of the powers of one de|partment, to encroach upon another. The &s;pirit of encroachment tends to con&s;olidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, what|ever be the form of government, a real de&s;poti&s;m. A ju&s;t e&s;timate of that love of power, and pronene&s;s to abu&s;e it, which predominates in the human heart, is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy us of the truth of this po&s;ition. The nece&s;&s;ity of reciprocal checks in the exerci&s;e of political power, by dividing and di&s;trib|uting it into different depo&s;itories, and con&s;titut|ing each the guardian of the public weal again&s;t inva&s;ions by the others, has been evinced by experi|ments, ancient and modern; &s;ome of them in our country, and under our own eyes. To pre&s;erve them, mu&s;t be as nece&s;&s;ary as to in&s;titute them. If, in the opinion of the people, the di&s;tribution or modification of the con&s;titutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amend|ment in the way which the Con&s;titution de&s;ignates.
<PB N="32" REF="039070_0028_101395B06AE02E58">
But let there be no change by u&s;urpation: for though this, in one in&s;tance, may be the in&s;tru|ment of good, it is the cu&s;tomary weapon by which free governments are de&s;troyed. The precedent mu&s;t always greatly overbalance, in permanent evil, any partial or tran&s;ient benefit which the u&s;e can at any time yield.</P>
<P>Of all the di&s;po&s;itions and habits, which lead to political pro&s;perity, religion and morality are indi&s;|pen&s;able &s;upports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patrioti&s;m, who &s;hould labour to &s;ub|vert the&s;e great pillars of human happine&s;s, the&s;e firme&s;t props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to re&s;pect and to cheri&s;h them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with public and private felicity. Let it be &s;imply a&s;ked, Where is the &s;ecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if a &s;en&s;e of religious obligation <HI>de&s;ert</HI> the oaths which are the in&s;truments of inve&s;tigation in courts of ju&s;tice? And let us with caution indulge the &s;up|po&s;ition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influ|ence of refined education, on minds of peculiar &s;tructure; rea&s;on and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail, in exclu|&s;ion of religious principle.</P>
<P>It is &s;ub&s;tantially true, that virtue or morality is a nece&s;&s;ary &s;pring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or le&s;s force, to ev|ery &s;pecies of free government. Who, that is a &s;in|cere friend to it, can look with indifference upon at|tempts to &s;hake the foundation of the fabric?</P>

In proportion as the &s;tructure of a govern|ment gives force to public opinion, it is e&s;&s;ential that public opinion &s;hould be enlightened.</P>
<P>As a very important &s;ource of &s;trength and &s;ecu|rity, cheri&s;h public credit. One method of pre|&s;erving it is, to u&s;e it as &s;paringly as po&s;&s;ible; avoid|ing occa&s;ions of expen&s;e by cultivating peace; but remembering al&s;o, that timely di&s;bur&s;ements, to pre|pare for danger, frequently prevent much greater di&s;bur&s;ements to repel it; avoiding, likewi&s;e, the accumulation of debt, not only by &s;hunning occa|&s;ions of expen&s;e, but by vigorous exertions, in time of peace, to di&s;charge the debts which una|voidable wars may have occa&s;ioned, not ungener|ou&s;ly throwing upon po&s;terity the burden which we our&s;elves ought to bear. The execution of the&s;e maxims belongs to your repre&s;entatives, but it is nece&s;&s;ary that public opinion &s;hould co-operate.</P>
<P>To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is e&s;&s;ential that you &s;hould practically bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there mu&s;t be revenue; that to have revenue there mu&s;t be taxes; that no taxes can be devi&s;ed, which are not, more or le&s;s, inconvenient and unplea&s;ant; that the intrin&s;ic embarra&s;&s;ment in&s;eparable from the &s;election of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a deci&s;ive motive for a candid con&s;truction of the conduct of the gov|ernment in making it, and for a &s;pirit of acquie&s;|cence in the mea&s;ures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve good faith and ju&s;tice towards all na|tions; cultivate peace and harmony with all: re|ligion and morality enjoin this conduct; and can it be, that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened, and (at no

Alas! is it rendered impo&s;&s;ible by its vices?</P>
<P>In the execution of &s;uch a plan, nothing is more e&s;&s;ential, than that permanent, inveterate antipathies again&s;t particular nations, and pa&s;&s;ionate attachments for others, &s;hould be excluded; and that, in the place of them, ju&s;t and amicable feelings towards all &s;hould be cultivated. The nation, which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondne&s;s, is in &s;ome degree a &s;lave. It is a &s;lave to its animo&s;ity or to its affection, either of which is &s;ufficient to lead it a&s;tray from its duty and its in|tere&s;t. Antipathy in one nation again&s;t another, di&s;po&s;es each more readily to offer in&s;ult and injury, to lay hold of &s;light cau&s;es of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when accidental or trifling occa&s;ions of di&s;pute occur. Hence frequent colli&s;|ions, ob&s;tinate, envenomed and bloody conte&s;ts. The nation, prompted by ill will and re&s;entment, &s;ometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the be&s;t calculations of policy. The government &s;ometimes participates in the national propen&s;ity, and adopts, through pa&s;&s;ion, what rea&s;on would re|ject; at other times, it makes the animo&s;ity of the nation &s;ub&s;ervient to the projects of ho&s;tility, in&s;ti|gated by pride, ambition, and other &s;ini&s;ter and per|nicious motives. The peace often, &s;ometimes per|haps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="039070_0031_101395882FB063A8">
So, likewi&s;e, a pa&s;&s;ionate attachment of one na|tion for another, produces a variety of evils. Sym|pathy for the favourite nation, facilitating the illu|&s;ion of an imaginary common intere&s;t, in ca&s;es where no real common intere&s;t exi&s;ts, and infu&s;ing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the for|mer into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or ju&s;tifi|cation. It leads al&s;o to conce&s;&s;ions to the favourite nation, of privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the conce&s;&s;ions; by unnece&s;&s;arily parting with what ought to have been retained; and by exciting jealou&s;y, ill will, and a di&s;po&s;ition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld: and it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote them&s;elves to the favourite nation) facility to betray, or &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts of their own country, without odium, &s;ometimes even with pop|ularity; gilding, with the appearances of a virtuous &s;en&s;e of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the ba&s;e or fooli&s;h compliance, of ambition, corrup|tion, or infatuation.</P>
<P>As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, &s;uch attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with dome&s;tic factions, to practi&s;e the arts of &s;educ|tion, to mi&s;lead public opinion, to influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a &s;mall or weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the &s;atellite of the latter.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the in&s;idious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealou&s;y of a free people ought to be con&s;tantly awake; &s;ince hi&s;tory and experience prove, that
<PB N="36" REF="039070_0032_101395B491D18DD0">
foreign influence is one of the mo&s;t baneful foes of Republican Government. But that jealou&s;y, to be u&s;eful, mu&s;t be impartial; el&s;e it becomes the in&s;tru|ment of the very influence to be avoided, in&s;tead of a defence again&s;t it. Exce&s;&s;ive partiality for one foreign nation, and exce&s;&s;ive di&s;like of another, cau&s;e tho&s;e whom they actuate to &s;ee danger only on one &s;ide, and &s;erve to veil and even &s;econd the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may re&s;i&s;t the intrigues of the favourite, are liable to become &s;u&s;pected and odious; while its tools and dupes u&s;urp the applau&s;e and confidence of the people, to &s;urrender their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to for|eign nations, is, in extending our commercial re|lations, to have with them as little political connex|ion as po&s;&s;ible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith.&mdash;Here let us &s;top.</P>
<P>Europe has a &s;et of primary intere&s;ts, which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence &s;he mu&s;t be engaged in frequent controver&s;ies, the cau&s;es of which are e&s;&s;entially foreign to our con|cerns. Hence, therefore, it mu&s;t be unwi&s;e in us to implicate our&s;elves, by artificial ties, in the ordi|nary vici&s;&s;itudes of her politics, or the ordinary com|binations and colli&s;ions of her friend&s;hips or enmities.</P>
<P>Our detached and di&s;tant &s;ituation invites and enables us to pur&s;ue a different cour&s;e. If we re|main one people, under an efficient government, the period is not far off, when we may defy materi|al injury from external annoyance; when we may take &s;uch an attitude, as will cau&s;e the neutrality, we may at any time re&s;olve upon, to be &s;crupulou&s;ly re&s;pected; when belligerent nations, under the im|po&s;&s;ibility of making acqui&s;itions upon us, will not
<PB N="37" REF="039070_0033_10139589F0D330F8">
lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may choo&s;e peace or war, as our intere&s;t, guided by ju&s;tice, &s;hall coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Why forego the advantages of &s;o peculiar a &s;itu|ation? Why quit our own, to &s;tand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our de&s;tiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and pro&s;perity in the toils of European ambition, rival|&s;hip, intere&s;t, humour or caprice?</P>
<P>It is our true policy to &s;teer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world; &s;o far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it: for let me not be under&s;tood as capable of patron|izing infidelity to exi&s;ting engagements. I hold the maxim no le&s;s applicable to public than to pri|vate affairs, that hone&s;ty is always the be&s;t policy. I repeat it, therefore, let tho&s;e engagements be ob|&s;erved in their genuine &s;en&s;e. But, in my opinion, it is unnece&s;&s;ary, and would be unwi&s;e, to extend them.</P>
<P>Taking care always to keep our&s;elves, by &s;uitable e&s;tabli&s;hments, on a re&s;pectable defen&s;ive po&s;ture, we may &s;afely tru&s;t to temporary alliances for extra|ordinary emergencies.</P>
<P>Harmony, liberal intercour&s;e with all nations, are recommended by policy, humanity and intere&s;t. But even our commercial policy, &s;hould hold an equal and impartial hand; neither &s;eeking nor granting exclu&s;ive favours or preferences; con&s;ult|ing the natural cour&s;e of things; diffu&s;ing and di|ver&s;ifying, by gentle means, the &s;treams of com|merce, but forcing nothing; e&s;tabli&s;hing, with the powers &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, in order to give trade a &s;table cour&s;e, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the government to &s;upport them, conven|tional rules of intercour&s;e, the be&s;t that pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="38" REF="039070_0034_101395B80D8282E8">
and mutual opinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time aban|doned or varied, as experience and circum&s;tances &s;hall dictate; con&s;tantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for di&s;intere&s;ted favours from another; that it mu&s;t pay, with a portion of its independence, for whatever it may accept under that character; that, by &s;uch acceptance, it may place it&s;elf in the condition of having given equiv|alents for nominal favours, and yet of being re|proached with ingratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favours from nation to nation. It is an illu&s;ion which experience mu&s;t cure, which a ju&s;t pride ought to di&s;card.</P>
<P>In offering to you, my countrymen, the&s;e coun|&s;els of an old and affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the &s;trong and la&s;ting impre&s;|&s;ion I could wi&s;h; that they will control the u&s;ual current of the pa&s;&s;ions, or prevent our nation from running the cour&s;e which has hitherto marked the de&s;tiny of nations: But if I may even flatter my&s;elf, that they may be productive of &s;ome partial bene|fit, &s;ome occa&s;ional good; that they may now and then recu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to moderate the fury of party &s;pirit, to warn again&s;t the mi&s;chiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard again&s;t the impo&s;tures of pretended patriot|i&s;m; this hope will be a full recompen&s;e for the &s;olicitude for your welfare, by which they have been dictated.</P>
<P>How far, in the di&s;charge of my official duties, I have been guided by the principles which have been delineated, the public records, and other evidences of my conduct, mu&s;t witne&s;s to you and to the world. To my&s;elf, the a&s;&s;urance of my own con&s;cience is, that I have at lea&s;t believed my&s;elf to be guided by them.</P>

In relation to the &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting war in Europe, my proclamation of the 22d of April, 1795, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice, and by that of your Repre&s;entatives in both Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, the &s;pirit of that mea&s;ure has continually governed me; uninfluenced by any at|tempts to deter or divert me from it.</P>
<P>After deliberate examination, with the aid of the be&s;t lights I could obtain, I was well &s;atisfied that our country, under all the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, had a right to take, and was bound in duty and intere&s;t to take, a neutral po&s;ition. Having taken it, I determined, as far as &s;hould depend upon me, to maintain it with moderation, per&s;everance and firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>The con&s;iderations which re&s;pect the right to hold this conduct, it is not nece&s;&s;ary on this occa|&s;ion to detail. I will only ob&s;erve, that, according to my under&s;tanding of the matter, that right, &s;o far from being denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually admitted by all.</P>
<P>The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without any thing more, from the obliga|tion which ju&s;tice and humanity impo&s;e on every nation, in ca&s;es in which it is free to act, to main|tain inviolate the relations of peace and amity to|wards other nations.</P>
<P>The inducements of intere&s;t for ob&s;erving that conduct will be be&s;t referred to your own reflec|tions and experience. With me, a predominant motive has been to endeavour to gain time to our country to &s;ettle and mature its yet recent in&s;titu|tions, and to progre&s;s, without interruption, to that degree of &s;trength and con&s;i&s;tency, which is nece&s;&s;a|ry to give it, humanly &s;peaking, the command of its own fortunes.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="039070_0036_101395BA734463C0">
Though in reviewing the incidents of my admin|i&s;tration, I am uncon&s;cious of intentional error, I am neverthele&s;s too &s;en&s;ible of my defects, not to think it probable that I may have committed ma|ny errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently be|&s;eech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I &s;hall al&s;o carry with me the hope that my country will never cea&s;e to view them with indulgence; and that after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its &s;ervice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be con&s;igned to oblivion, as my&s;elf mu&s;t &s;oon be to the man&s;ions of re&s;t.</P>
<P>Relying on its kindne&s;s in this as in other things, and actuated by that fervent love towards it, which is &s;o natural to a man who views in it the native &s;oil of him&s;elf and his progenitors for &s;everal gen|erations; I anticipate, with plea&s;ing expectation, that retreat, in which I promi&s;e my&s;elf to realize, without alloy, the &s;weet enjoyment of partaking, in the mid&s;t of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws under a free government&mdash;the ever favourite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I tru&s;t, of our mutual cares, labours and dangers.</P>
