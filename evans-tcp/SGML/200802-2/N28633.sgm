<Q><BIBL>11. SAMUEL, iii.38.</BIBL>
<P>KNOW YE NOT THAT THERE IS A PRINCE AND A GREAT MAN FALLEN THIS DAY IN ISRAEL?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>YOU cannot hear the&s;e words, my Brethren, without thinking of an event, which, as the tidings of it fly from one me&s;&s;enger to an|other, from one city to another, and from one &s;tate to another, &s;preads a gloom throughout this widely extended continent, and throws a whole nation into the deepe&s;t mourning. Like the &s;hock of an earth|quake, or thunder from heaven, &s;udden and unex|pected, we have heard the alarming intelligence, that WASHINGTON <HI>is dead.</HI>&mdash;What concern and grief overwhelm the minds of all virtuous citizens! In our American I&s;rael <HI>is fallen a prince,</HI> eminent and di&s;tingui&s;hed above all the other princes of the age; a man <HI>great</HI> in whatever can contribute to the ex|cellence, dignity, and greatne&s;s of the human char|acter, above all the other great men who dwell upon the face of the earth. Since the exit of the in&s;pired leaders of God's ancient I&s;rael, it may be doubted, whether, among the generals, heroes, and &s;tate&s;men, who have &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed over the &s;tage of life, and filled the world with the glory of their names and ex|ploits, &s;o fini&s;hed a character as the father of his
<PB N="6" REF="038170_0004_10111465638BFDA8">
country, whom we this day lament, has departed from the&s;e regions of mortality.</P>
<P>At all times, and through every age, a few men are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the common ma&s;s of their &s;pecies, and, as compared with others, are denomi|nated great. On account of eminence in &s;everal dif|ferent re&s;pects, this appellation is given. In vulgar ap|prehen&s;ion, great riches and power entitle their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors to be called great men. Speaking of Abner, David, in the text, calls him <HI>a prince and a great man,</HI> becau&s;e he was exalted, not only above his fellow-citizens in general, but above all the other high of|ficers under the crown, having been, through a great part of his life, captain of the ho&s;t, entru&s;ted, under Saul, and afterward under his &s;on, with the chief command of the armies of I&s;rael. In this high &s;ta|tion, he was univer&s;ally known; and had acquired a weight of character, and an extent of influence, in the affairs of the nation, beyond that of any other citizen. His fall "mu&s;t have in&s;pired every mind with grave and &s;erious reflections. <HI>A great man fallen!</HI> and fallen by &s;o unexpected and &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing a treachery; and in the eye of a great revolution, &s;eemingly dependent upon his fate!" Yet it mu&s;t be remembered, that his was a worldly greatne&s;s only, without any mixture, or, at lea&s;t, predominance of real goodne&s;s. This great man had deliberately op|po&s;ed him&s;elf to the known will of the great God; and had &s;ported with the lives of his brethren. He was not ignorant of the divine de&s;ignation of David to the throne of I&s;rael; yet, through motives of in|tere&s;t and ambition, had <HI>made him&s;elf &s;trong for the hou&s;e of Saul.</HI> Putting him&s;elf at the head of this nu|merous and powerful faction, he commenced a civil war; and, for a &s;eries of years, compelled the nation
<PB N="7" REF="038170_0005_10111468746F08E0">
to endure its calamities. "It is true, that he was now returned to his duty; but it is as true, that he returned to it now, as he departed from it before, upon a pique, and from motives of ambition, intere&s;t, and revenge." By &s;uch principles was this captain of the ho&s;t influenced, even in his be&s;t actions, and when he projected &s;chemes for the public peace and pro&s;perity. Still he was a great man in the e&s;tima|tion of the world, and had the power of a prince among the tribes of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>SIMILAR to his, has been the character of no &s;mall proportion of the great men of the earth, through every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive age. From the bu&s;tle and noi&s;e which they have made in the world; from their victories and triumphs; from the changes and revo|lutions which their coun&s;els or exploits have effected in the affairs of &s;tates and nations, they have been denominated great. Hi&s;tory informs us of Alexan|der the great, of Pompey the great, of Charlemagne, Lewis the fourteenth, and the late Frederick; but when their characters are analyzed, the principles and motives of their conduct are &s;crutinized, what are they better than the great man in the text? They &s;tand, it is true, as on an eminence, above the re&s;t of their &s;pecies, the objects of general homage and admira|tion. The glory of their names, and the &s;plendor of their achievements, are pre&s;erved in the annals of hi&s;tory, and handed down with eclat from one gen|eration to another. We are dazzled with the lu&s;tre that &s;urrounds them. When thus viewed at a di&s;|tance, we admire their abilities, the va&s;tne&s;s and ex|tent of their &s;chemes, their reach of thought, their penetration, their quick di&s;cernment of every advan|tage, their dexterity in &s;eizing it; their per&s;everance, intrepidity, and &s;ucce&s;s. But, upon a clo&s;er in&s;pec|tion
<PB N="8" REF="038170_0006_1011146C1CEEC0E8">
of their characters, of their governing princi|ples and views, the tendency of their plans, and the nature of the means by which they were pro&s;ecuted, our rea&s;on and judgment mu&s;t withhold from them the approbation of the heart. We &s;ee the&s;e great men pur&s;uing the &s;ame kind of policy, and influenced by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ted views, &s;o apparent in the conduct of Abner. Whether they meditated peace or war, the tranquillity or di&s;turbance of the world, the pro&s;perity or deva&s;tation of countries; &s;till intere&s;t, ambition, or revenge was their leading motive. While they governed nations and com|manded armies, it often appeared, that they had no command over them&s;elves. After gaining victories, taking citadels, and &s;ubduing countries, by <HI>having no rule over their own &s;pirits,</HI> by &s;etting no bounds to their ambition and cupidity, their minds re&s;embled the ruin which they had &s;pread, <HI>a city broken down and without walls,</HI> con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to the ravages of ex|orbitant de&s;ires and lawle&s;s pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>BUT though this want of &s;elf-government has been the common defect in the character, not only of the great heroes and conquerors of the world, but of its great politicians and &s;tate&s;men, by who&s;e coun&s;els the affairs of nations and empires have been directed; yet, through the mercy of God, there have been &s;ome exceptions, &s;ome who have been <HI>good</HI> as well as great, who&s;e great abilities have been accompanied with great virtues; and who have ri&s;en to eminence and di&s;tinction by the joint di&s;play of both. At the head of armies, and at the helm of government, there have been &s;ome, who, in the height of their elevation, amid&s;t all the allurements of intere&s;t, pride, ambition, and &s;en&s;uality; while covered with glory, inve&s;ted with power, and abounding in wealth, have
<PB N="9" REF="038170_0007_1011146FB6E836A0">
yet &s;hown them&s;elves able to control their pa&s;&s;ions, to moderate their de&s;ires, to forego all &s;elfi&s;h views, and pre&s;erve a character for piety, benevolence, di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s, ju&s;tice, meekne&s;s, temperance, purity; in &s;hort, for whatever is amiable, lovely, and prai&s;e|worthy in religion, morals, and manners. Amid&s;t the greate&s;t difficulties, embarra&s;&s;ments, and dangers of their public &s;tations, their minds have been &s;upe|rior to fear, to mean compliances, unworthy conce&s;|&s;ions, or di&s;honourable expedients. Firm and con|&s;tant to the principles of rectitude and patrioti&s;m, they have uniformly conducted with integrity and uprightne&s;s. The vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune effected no change in their character or manners: they were the &s;ame, both in pro&s;perity and in adver&s;ity. Un|di&s;mayed at the mo&s;t formidable pro&s;pects, and un|contaminated amid&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t temptations to corruption; no bribe could &s;educe them, no terror could overawe them. They were never melted by plea&s;ure into effeminacy, nor &s;unk by misfortunes into de&s;pondency. In every &s;ituation, they &s;teadily per&s;evered in di&s;charging what they apprehended to be their duty, without being &s;wayed by the applau&s;e or cen&s;ures of the world, when the&s;e would have &s;e|duced them from following the dictates of con|&s;cience. Though they were far from de&s;pi&s;ing the opinions of their fellow-men, yet, con&s;idering them|&s;elves accountable to God, and making his approba|tion their chief and ultimate aim; in compari&s;on with this, it was <HI>a &s;mall thing with them to be judged by man's judgment.</HI> It was their great concern to be faithful to the Being whom they devoutly wor&s;hip|ped, and to the principles of the religion which they &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;incerely profe&s;&s;ed. Abounding in be|nevolence towards mankind in general, they were faithful to their friends, generous to their enemies,
<PB N="10" REF="038170_0008_10111473051B9248">
ea&s;ily touched with compa&s;&s;ion for the poor, the un|fortunate and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; apparently in&s;en&s;ible to lit|tle ill offices towards, and uncandid &s;trictures upon, them&s;elves; often &s;elf-denying with re&s;pect to &s;maller private intere&s;ts and plea&s;ures, but always zealous and ardent in whatever concerned the public welfare. In their private deportment and public conduct, they di&s;played dignity and magnanimity, without pride; humility, without meanne&s;s; ju&s;tice, without par|tiality, har&s;hne&s;s or &s;everity; liberality, without pro|fu&s;ion; courage, without ra&s;hne&s;s or pre&s;umption. With a nice &s;en&s;e of propriety, they did every thing in the be&s;t manner, and at the mo&s;t &s;uitable &s;ea&s;on. Wary and circum&s;pect, though not artful or de&s;ign|ing, they were wi&s;e and penetrating in di&s;covering and eluding the &s;nares of enemies and opponents; &s;agacious and prudent in fore&s;eeing and guarding a|gain&s;t dangers and accidents; never expo&s;ing them|&s;elves, or the cau&s;e with which they were entru&s;ted, to any ri&s;k, detriment, or embarra&s;&s;ment, which could be decently and honourably avoided. Com|po&s;ed on the greate&s;t occa&s;ions, and re&s;pectable on the lea&s;t; they were &s;imple in their manners, though manly in their feelings. Their looks never deceiv|ed; their word in&s;pired confidence; their profe&s;&s;ions were always the effu&s;ions of their hearts.</P>
<P>CHARACTERS, like the&s;e, my brethren, will bear the clo&s;e&s;t &s;crutiny. The more minutely you ex|amine them, the more rigidly you try them by the te&s;t of rea&s;on, truth, and rectitude, the more you will be con&s;trained, in your hearts, to admire, reverence, e&s;teem, and love them. The lu&s;tre of their mo&s;t &s;plendid actions, in&s;tead of being le&s;&s;ened, is height|ened and increa&s;ed by taking into view, the excel|lence of their motives.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="038170_0009_1011147651EA78B8">SOME &s;uch characters, my hearers, through the different ages, and among the different nations of the world, have exalted and adorned human nature, and &s;hed a benign influence on human affairs. So &s;el|dom, indeed, has been their appearance, that they have been mere phoenomena in the earth. With &s;uch a phoenomenon, however, in its mo&s;t full and perfect &s;tate, it has plea&s;ed the Almighty to ble&s;s, honour, and di&s;tingui&s;h the inhabitants of this new world, above all modern nations. Nay, I do not re|member to have read in any volume of profane hi&s;|tory, whether ancient or modern, nor even in the fictions of romance, of a &s;ingle character &s;o exempt from every &s;pot of vice, every &s;hade of weakne&s;s or indi&s;cretion; &s;o complete in the abilities of a General, in the talents of a State&s;man, in the virtues of a Cit|izen, and, in all other re&s;pects, equal to Him, who, at the call of his country, headed our armies through the long &s;eries of trying &s;cenes, which attended our revolution; who&s;e influence &s;aved our all from be|ing lo&s;t by divi&s;ion; held together, or, at lea&s;t, was the mo&s;t important tie in preventing the disjunction and di&s;&s;olution of the fir&s;t &s;lender and ill-cemented union of the&s;e &s;tates; who pre&s;ided on the great oc|ca&s;ion, when, by an ameliorated national compact, they were con&s;olidated; when the admirable machine of our pre&s;ent general government was con&s;tructed; who put this machine in motion, and, through the cour&s;e of eight years, &s;o guided its operations, as to enable his fellow-citizens fully to enjoy all its &s;ignal advantages; and after having retired, with the ut|mo&s;t dignity and honour, from the cares of &s;tate, to &s;pend the &s;hort remains of life in preparation for its clo&s;ing &s;cene; foreign violence and intrigue, com|bined with the turbulent, malignant &s;pirit of dome&s;|tic faction, rearing their gorgon form, and menacing

the fair fabric which his labours had been &s;o in&s;tru|mental in rai&s;ing, his patriotic ardour grew indignant; &s;tepping back from his beloved retreat, he again bran|di&s;hed his &s;word; and, with all the maje&s;ty of hea|ven-in&s;pired virtue, frowned on the rebel-rout of "demons let loo&s;e." At this awful juncture, Divine Providence removed him from a world no longer worthy of &s;uch goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT remains, that we mourn, as we ought, the fall of this great and good man in our I&s;rael. Not for his &s;ake per&s;onally, indeed, have we any occa&s;ion, or ought we, to lament. From his work of righteou&s;|ne&s;s on earth, he is relea&s;ed, that he may enjoy its reward in heaven. But for our&s;elves, and our coun|try, we have abundant rea&s;on to weep, exclaiming at his departure, <HI>my father, my father! the chariot of I&s;rael, and the hor&s;emen thereof.</HI> To the living, the lo&s;s of &s;uch a trea&s;ure is incalculable. To him, the virtuous and good, all enlightened and true patriots, all the friends of real liberty, not only in America, but throughout Europe, looked up, as to a kind of head and exemplar; e&s;pecially at the pre&s;ent eventful and alarming era, when the name of liberty, the rights of man, and the nature of good government, are &s;o dreadfully mi&s;under&s;tood, and &s;o horribly abu&s;ed; when &s;o heavy a cloud over&s;preads the civilized world, and the blind hurricane of revolution con|tinues its deva&s;tation. Our own government had indeed, upon his retreat, devolved upon able and faithful men; but &s;till he continued as a pillar for its &s;upport. The weight of his opinion, and the influ|ence of his example, were highly important in the balance again&s;t the novel and &s;trange opinions &s;o pre|dominant at the pre&s;ent moment. What may en&s;ue upon the lo&s;s of &s;uch a prop, we cannot but be ap|prehen&s;ive.
<PB N="13" REF="038170_0011_1011147CDD56A2A8">
We know it to be one of the methods of Divine Providence, when heavy calamities are in &s;tore for any people, previou&s;ly to remove from among them, tho&s;e who would &s;tand in the gap, and be in&s;trumental in warding them off. Previous to the mi&s;ery and ruin of his ancient people, <HI>becau&s;e their tongue and their doings were again&s;t the Lord,</HI> it was threatened, that <HI>the Lord, the Lord of ho&s;ts, would take away from Judah and Jeru&s;alem, the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge and the prophet, the prudent and ancient, the honourable man and the coun&s;ellor.</HI> In fulfilment of this denunciation, a &s;eemingly prema|ture death was allotted to the eminently good Jo&s;iah, on purpo&s;e that &s;o meritorious a character might no longer avert or delay the de&s;erved puni&s;hment of a &s;inful people; and in mercy to him&s;elf, that he might neither know nor &s;hare in their mi&s;eries. It is mentioned as a proof, both of the guilt and &s;tu|pidity of the incorrigibly wicked, that <HI>they lay it not to heart; nor con&s;ider that the righteous are taken away from the evil to come.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING, my brethren, can be more proper or rea&s;onable, more prudent or intere&s;ting to our&s;elves, than that our grief and boding fears, on the pre&s;ent melancholy occa&s;ion, &s;hould induce us to for&s;ake all our evil habits and practices; and rou&s;e us to a &s;in|cere repentance and thorough amendment. To this we are called by the voice of providence, not in a &s;ingle event only, but by a continued &s;eries of awful di&s;pen&s;ations. For a long time pa&s;t, the judgments of Heaven, in their mo&s;t tremendous form, have been abroad in the earth. We cannot hope ultimately to e&s;cape them, unle&s;s we &s;peedily learn righteou&s;ne&s;s. To this, as the only way of &s;afety, natural rea&s;on and con&s;cience prompt us, and divine revelation mo&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="038170_0012_101114824103F2E0">
earne&s;tly exhorts us. In this way we are allowed to hope, that our peace and tranquillity may yet be lengthened out and prolonged.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the ab&s;olute dependence of the univer&s;e of creatures upon its great Author; how he &s;uperintends all human affairs, changing times and &s;ea&s;ons, &s;u&s;pending on high the invi&s;ible balance, containing the fates of nations, often giving to &s;light occurrences the power of turning this balance; of <HI>&s;etting up kings and kingdoms,</HI> and then of <HI>putting them down;</HI> of <HI>enlarging and increa&s;ing the nations,</HI> and then <HI>of &s;traitening them again;</HI> and that <HI>at what time he &s;peak|eth concerning a nation or kingdom, to build and to plant it, or to pluck up, pull down and de&s;troy it;</HI> all &s;hall be done according to his coun&s;els; that all the commotions and revolutionary movements in every country, and among every people throughout the earth, with their hidden &s;prings and cau&s;es, as well as their vi&s;ible con&s;equences and effects, are irre&s;i&s;tibly controled and unerringly directed by his univer&s;al providence, &s;o as exactly to accompli&s;h the de&s;tinations of his will; when we think of the&s;e things, we cannot but feel how much it concerns us, both as individuals and as a nation, to be in a &s;tate of favour with this omnipotent Ruler.</P>
<P>IF we &s;in again&s;t him, he has many ways in which to make us feel the effects of his di&s;plea&s;ure. It is not by death only, that he deprives &s;uch a people of their benefactors, of tho&s;e good rulers who &s;hield them from calamities. As it is he <HI>who giveth wi&s;dom to the wi&s;e,</HI> and <HI>knowledge to them who know under&s;tand|ing</HI> &mdash;who are <HI>&s;kilful in the times,</HI> and in <HI>what I&s;rael ought to do;</HI> as all the abilities of good rulers are from him, &s;o he has threatened to withhold the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings from a di&s;obedient people, to infatuate their

<P>AMONG the many rich ble&s;&s;ings, which Heaven has poured upon the people of the&s;e United States, through the medium of a WASHINGTON, one of the fir&s;t magnitude has been our pre&s;ervation from this mi&s;ery. With what unwearied efforts, through the whole cour&s;e of his public life, did he labour, night and day, to &s;ave us from being wrecked on this fatal rock? To the very la&s;t, he was &s;o appre|hen&s;ive of our continued hazard in this re&s;pect, that, in his farewell addre&s;s, there is no other topic which he labours with &s;uch copious and per&s;ua&s;ive elo|quence. Indeed, it is the chief and main object of the addre&s;s, to impre&s;s our minds with a &s;en&s;e of the infinite importance of our continued union; and to put us upon our guard again&s;t the cau&s;es and circum|&s;tances which may po&s;&s;ibly occa&s;ion divi&s;ion. He tells us, that "the government, which con&s;titutes us one people, is a main pillar in the edifice of our in|dependence, the &s;upport of our tranquillity at home, our peace abroad; of our &s;afety; of our pro&s;perity; of that very liberty which we &s;o highly prize." He warns us, that, "as this is the point in our political fortre&s;s, again&s;t which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be mo&s;t con&s;tantly and actively

and habits," &s;ays this venerable and unequalled patriot, "which lead to political pro&s;perity, religion and morality are indi&s;pen&s;able &s;upports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patrioti&s;m, who would labour to &s;ubvert the&s;e great pillars of human happine&s;s, the&s;e firme&s;t props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to re&s;pect and cheri&s;h them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with private and public felicity. It is &s;ub&s;tantially true, that morality is a nece&s;&s;ary &s;pring of popular govern|ment. Rea&s;on and experience both forbid us to ex|pect, that national morality can prevail in the exclu|&s;ion of religious principle." From &s;uch a per&s;onage, how important, e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent times, is this te&s;timony to the u&s;efulne&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity of religion!</P>
<P>WHAT he here, by precept, &s;o forcibly urges upon us, he has, in the mo&s;t alluring and engaging man|ner, exemplified in his own practice. On religious principle, as their grand ba&s;is, we have every rea&s;on to believe, his own great character, illu&s;trious vir|tues, and exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s, were built. No other foundation ever did, or can &s;u&s;tain &s;o noble and fin|i&s;hed a &s;tructure.</P>
<P>GREAT men, indeed, there have been, of who&s;e religion we have yet rea&s;on to doubt. But from what were their greatne&s;s and celebrity derived? from the high &s;tation, perhaps, to which birth, court-fa|vour, popular prejudice, corruption, u&s;urpation, or even violence &s;ucceeded in rai&s;ing them; from excel|lence in &s;ome particular profe&s;&s;ion, art, &s;cience, or branch of knowledge; from a lucky di&s;covery or u&s;eful invention; or, it may be, from the mere ca|price of fortune, in making them her cho&s;en favour|ites; from &s;ome &s;plendid action, which chance gave

them the opportunity of performing; from an occa|tional di&s;play of abilities in a particular &s;ituation, or during a certain portion of their lives. Not a few have blazed forth for a moment, and received, for a while, the applau&s;e of the public; who have, after|ward, dwindled and &s;unk into forgotten ob&s;curity. But no man, I will venture to affirm, not animated and &s;upported by religious principle, ever pa&s;&s;ed a long life of ince&s;&s;ant labour in the highe&s;t public &s;ta|tions, diver&s;ified with ever varying and con&s;tantly trying &s;cenes; and yet, through his whole progre&s;s, conducted with &s;uch wi&s;dom, diligence, fidelity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, as uniformly to dignify and adorn each &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;tation, and every vici&s;&s;itude of condi|tion; reflecting to the la&s;t, a &s;teady, undimini&s;hed lu&s;tre in the eyes of an admiring and applauding world.</P>
<P>MY brethren, it is incumbent upon us this day, with hearts glowing with gratitude, mo&s;t devoutly to thank God, not only for the &s;ucce&s;s and pro&s;peri|ty which he has already conferred upon our nation, through the in&s;trumentality of its now departed friend, but for the great benefits which we may hope &s;till to derive from the influence of that example of wi&s;dom, patrioti&s;m, virtue, and religion, which, as his falling mantle, we &s;till retain. What could have been more important to us, after our national and &s;olid union under one general government, than the having of &s;uch a character for our fir&s;t chief magi&s;|trate; the excellence of who&s;e mea&s;ures, coun&s;els, and manner of admini&s;tration, might &s;erve as a model for his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in office. Indeed, his dili|gence, prudence, faithfulne&s;s, and integrity, are a model for all public officers, of every grade and de|&s;cription, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t. In what
<PB N="19" REF="038170_0017_10111493C7A66F60">
he was, they may &s;ee what they ought to be. Nay, from the manner in which he pre&s;ided at the head of the nation, we may all learn how we ought to pre|&s;ide in our re&s;pective families, and maintain order, peace, unity, virtue, and religion, in our hou&s;es. In no way can we &s;o honour his memory, as by the imitation of his virtues. This too will be the proper improvement of that melancholy di&s;pen&s;ation of pro|vidence which has removed him from us. If, as a people, we copy after that example of rectitude and goodne&s;s which he has &s;et us, we may hope that Heaven will continue to ble&s;s us with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of rulers re&s;embling him. But, what is yet infinitely more important to us individually, by this only can we have a rational hope of dwelling forever hereaf|ter with him, and others like him, in the general a&s;|&s;embly <HI>of the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect. The memo|rial of virtue is immortal. It is known with God and with men. When it is pre&s;ent, men take example at it; and when it is gone, they de&s;ire it. It weareth a crown and triumpheth forever, &s;triving for undefiled rewards.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Legacy of the Father of his Country. ADDRESS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON, ON DECLINING BEING CONSIDERED A CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE period for a new election of a citizen, to ad|mini&s;ter the executive government of the Uni|ted States, being not far di&s;tant, and the time actually arrived, when your thoughts mu&s;t be employed in de&s;ignating the per&s;on, who is to be clothed with that important tru&s;t, it appears to me proper, e&s;pe|cially as it may conduce to a more di&s;tinct expre&s;&s;ion of the public voice, that I &s;hould now appri&s;e you of the re&s;olution I have formed, to decline being con|&s;idered among the number of tho&s;e, out of whom a choice is to be made.</P>
<P>I beg you, at the &s;ame time, to do me the ju&s;tice to be a&s;&s;ured, that this re&s;olution has not been taken without a &s;trict regard to all the con&s;iderations apper|taining to the relation, which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of &s;ervice which &s;ilence in my &s;ituation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future intere&s;t; no deficiency of grateful re&s;pect for your pa&s;t kindne&s;s: but am &s;upported by a full con|viction that the &s;tep is compatible with both.</P>
<P>The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in office, to which your &s;uffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform &s;acrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what appear|ed
<PB N="22" REF="038170_0019_10111496DEF87F50">
to be your de&s;ire. I con&s;tantly hoped, that it would have been much earlier in my power, con&s;i&s;|tently with motives which I was not at liberty to di&s;|regard, to return to that retirement, from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The &s;trength of my in|clination to do this, previous to the la&s;t election, had even led to the preparation of an addre&s;s to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical po&s;ture of affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of per&s;ons entitled to my confidence, impelled me to abandon the idea.</P>
<P>I rejoice, that the &s;tate of your concerns, external as well as internal, no longer renders the pur&s;uit of inclination incompatible with the &s;entiment of duty, or propriety: and am per&s;uaded, whatever partial|ity may be retained for my &s;ervice, that, in the pre&s;|ent circum&s;tances of our country, you will not di&s;|approve my determination to retire.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ions, with which I fir&s;t undertook the arduous tru&s;t, were explained on the proper occa&s;ion. In the di&s;charge of this tru&s;t, I will only &s;ay, that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and admini&s;tration of the government, the be&s;t exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not uncon&s;cious, in the out-&s;et, of the inferiority of my qualifications, experience in my own eyes, perhaps &s;till more in the eyes of others, has &s;trengthened the motives to diffidence of my&s;elf: and every day the increa&s;ing weight of years admon|i&s;hes me more and more, that the &s;hade of retire|ment is as nece&s;&s;ary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any circum&s;tances have given pecu|liar value to my &s;ervices, they were temporary, I have the con&s;olation to believe, that, while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political &s;cene, pat|rioti&s;m does not forbid it.</P>
<P>In looking forward to the moment, which is in|tended
<PB N="23" REF="038170_0020_1011149F82AEC868">
to terminate the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to &s;u&s;pend the deep ac|knowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country, for the many honours it has conferred upon me; &s;till more for the &s;teadfa&s;t con|fidence with which it has &s;upported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manife&s;ting my inviolable attachment, by &s;ervices faithful and per&s;evering, though in u&s;efulne&s;s unequal to my zeal. If benefits have re&s;ulted to our country from the&s;e &s;ervices, let it always be remembered to our prai&s;e, and as an in&s;tructive example in our annals, that un|der circum&s;tances in which the pa&s;&s;ions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mi&s;lead, amid&s;t appear|ances &s;ometimes dubious, vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, of|ten di&s;couraging in &s;ituations, in which not unfre|quently want of &s;ucce&s;s has countenanced the &s;pirit of critici&s;m&mdash;the con&s;tancy of your &s;upport was the e&s;&s;ential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the plans, by which they were effected. Profoundly pen|etrated with this idea, I &s;hall carry it with me to my grave, as a &s;trong incitement to uncea&s;ing vows, that Heaven may continue to you the choice&s;t tokens of its beneficence&mdash;that your union and brotherly af|fection may be perpetual&mdash;that the free Con&s;titution, which is the work of your hands, may be &s;acredly maintained&mdash;that its admini&s;tration, in every depart|ment, may be &s;tamped with wi&s;dom and virtue&mdash; that, in fine, the happine&s;s of the people of the&s;e States, under the au&s;pices of liberty, may be made complete, by &s;o careful a pre&s;ervation and &s;o prudent a u&s;e of this ble&s;&s;ing, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applau&s;e, the affec|tion, and adoption of every nation which is yet a &s;tranger to it.</P>
<P>Here, perhaps, I ought to &s;top. But &s;olicitude for your welfare, which cannot end but with my life,
<PB N="24" REF="038170_0021_101114A123A42158">
and the apprehen&s;ion of danger natural to that &s;olici|tude, urge me, on an occa&s;ion like the pre&s;ent, to offer to your &s;olemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent review, &s;ome &s;entiments, which are the re&s;ult of much reflection, of no incon&s;iderable ob&s;ervation, and which appear to me all-important to the permanency of your felicity as a people.&mdash; The&s;e will be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only feel in them the di&s;intere&s;ted warn|ings of a parting friend, who can po&s;&s;ibly have no per&s;onal motive to bias his coun&s;el. Nor can I for|get, as an encouragement to it, your indulgent re|ception of my &s;entiments on a former, and not di&s;|&s;imilar occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every liga|ment of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is nece&s;&s;ary to fortify or confirm the attachment.</P>
<P>The unity of government, which con&s;titutes you one people, is al&s;o now dear to you. It is ju&s;tly &s;o; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real inde|pendence; the &s;upport of your tranquillity at home, your peace abroad; of your &s;afety; of your pro&s;|perity; of that very liberty which you &s;o highly prize. But, as it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that from differ|ent cau&s;es, and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your political fortre&s;s, again&s;t which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be mo&s;t con&s;tantly and actively (though often covertly and in&s;idiou&s;ly) directed, it is of infinite moment that you &s;hould properly e&s;timate the immen&s;e value of your National Union, to your collective and indi|vidual happine&s;s; that you &s;hould cheri&s;h a cordial, habitual, and immoveable attachment to it; accu&s;|toming your&s;elves to think and &s;peak of it as of the palladium of your political &s;afety and pro&s;perity;

watching for its pre&s;ervation with jealous anxiety; di&s;countenancing whatever may &s;ugge&s;t even a &s;u&s;|picion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the fir&s;t dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the re&s;t, or to enfeeble the &s;acred ties which now link together the various parts.</P>
<P>For this, you have every inducement of &s;ympathy and intere&s;t. Citizens, by birth or choice, of a com|mon country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of AMERICAN, which be|longs to you in your national capacity, mu&s;t always exalt the ju&s;t pride of patrioti&s;m, more than any ap|pellation derived from local di&s;criminations. With &s;light &s;hades of difference, you have the &s;ame religion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have, in a common cau&s;e, fought and triumphed together; the Independence and Liberty you po&s;&s;e&s;s are the work of joint councils, and joint efforts, of common dangers, &s;ufferings and &s;ucce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But the&s;e con&s;iderations, however powerfully they addre&s;s them&s;elves to your &s;en&s;ibility, are greatly out|weighed by tho&s;e which apply more immediately to your intere&s;t. Here every portion of our country finds the mo&s;t commanding motives for carefully guarding and pre&s;erving the union of the whole.</P>
<P>The <HI>North,</HI> in an unre&s;trained intercour&s;e with the <HI>South,</HI> protected by the equal laws of a common gov|ernment, finds in the productions of the latter, great additional re&s;ources of maritime and commercial en|terpri&s;e, and precious materials of manufacturing in|du&s;try. The <HI>South,</HI> in the &s;ame intercour&s;e, benefit|ing by the agency of the <HI>North,</HI> &s;ees its agriculture grow, and its commerce expand. Turning partly in|to its own channels the &s;eamen of the <HI>North,</HI> it finds its particular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in different ways, to nouri&s;h and increa&s;e
<PB N="26" REF="038170_0023_101114A5CB0A2818">
the general ma&s;s of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime &s;trength, to which it&s;elf is unequally adapted. The <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> in a like intercour&s;e with the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> already finds, and, in the progre&s;&s;ive improvement of interior communications, by land and water, will more and more find a valu|able vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad, or manufactures at home. The <HI>We&s;t</HI> derives from the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> &s;upplies requi&s;ite to its growth and comfort; and, what is perhaps of &s;till greater con&s;e|quence, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity owe the <HI>&s;ecure</HI> enjoyment of indi&s;pen&s;able <HI>outlets</HI> for its own productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime &s;trength of the Atlantic &s;ide of the Union, directed by an indi&s;|&s;oluble community of intere&s;t as <HI>one nation.</HI> Any other tenure, by which the <HI>We&s;t</HI> can hold this e&s;&s;ential advan|tage, whether derived from its own &s;eparate &s;trength, or from an apo&s;tate and unnatural connexion with any foreign power, mu&s;t be intrin&s;ically precarious.</P>
<P>While, then, every part of our country thus feels an immediate and particular intere&s;t in Union, all the parts combined cannot fail to find, in the united ma&s;s of means and efforts, greater &s;trength, greater re|&s;ource, proportionably greater &s;ecurity from external danger, a le&s;s frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is of ine&s;timable value! they mu&s;t derive from Union an exemption from tho&s;e broils and wars between them&s;elves, which &s;o frequently afflict neighbouring countries, not tied to|gether by the &s;ame government; which their own rival&s;hips alone would be &s;ufficient to produce, but which oppo&s;ite foreign alliances, attachments, and in|trigues would &s;timulate and imbitter. Hence, like|wi&s;e, they will avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e overgrown military e&s;tabli&s;hments, which, under any form of government, are inau&s;picious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly ho&s;tile to Republi|can
<PB N="27" REF="038170_0024_101114A928F5AC08">
Liberty. In this &s;en&s;e it is, that your Union ought to be con&s;idered as a main prop of your liber|ty; and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the pre&s;ervation of the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations &s;peak a per&s;ua&s;ive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the UNION as a primary object of a patriotic de&s;ire. Is there a doubt, whether a com|mon government can embrace &s;o large a &s;phere? Let experience &s;olve it. To li&s;ten to mere &s;peculation, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, were criminal. We are authori&s;ed to hope, that a proper organization of the whole, with the auxiliary agency of governments for the re&s;pec|tive &s;ubdivi&s;ions, will afford a happy i&s;&s;ue to the ex|periment. It is well worth a fair and full experi|ment. With &s;uch powerful and obvious motives to Union, affecting all parts of our country, while ex|periment &s;hall not have demon&s;trated its impractica|bility, there will always be rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t the pat|rioti&s;m of tho&s;e, who in any quarter may endeavour to weaken its bands.</P>
<P>In contemplating the cau&s;es which may di&s;turb our Union, it occurs as matter of &s;erious concern, that any ground &s;hould be furni&s;hed for characteri&s;ing parties, by <HI>Geographical</HI> di&s;criminations&mdash;<HI>Northern</HI> and <HI>Southern&mdash;Atlantic</HI> and <HI>We&s;tern</HI>&mdash;whence de&s;igning men may endeavour to excite a belief, that there is a real difference of local intere&s;ts and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence, within particular di&s;tricts, is to mi&s;repre&s;ent the opinions and aims of other di&s;tricts. You cannot &s;hield your &s;elves too much again&s;t the jealou&s;ies and heart-burn|ings which &s;pring from the&s;e mi&s;repre&s;entations: they tend to render alien to each other tho&s;e who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our we&s;tern country have lately had a u&s;eful le&s;&s;on on this head: they have &s;een, in
<PB N="28" REF="038170_0025_101114AC58727BE0">
the negociation by the Executive, and in the unan|imous ratification by the Senate, of the treaty with Spain, and in the univer&s;al &s;atisfaction at that event, throughout the United States, a deci&s;ive proof how unfounded were the &s;u&s;picions, propagated among them, of a policy in the general government and in the Atlantic &s;tates unfriendly to their intere&s;ts in re|gard to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi: they have been witne&s;&s;es to the formation of two treaties, that with Great-Britain and that with Spain, which &s;ecure to them every thing they could de&s;ire, in re&s;pect to our foreign re|lations, towards confirming their pro&s;perity. Will it not be their wi&s;dom to rely, for the pre&s;ervation of the&s;e advantages, on the UNION by which they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to tho&s;e advi&s;ers, if &s;uch there are, who would &s;ever them from their brethren, and connect them with aliens?</P>
<P>To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the whole is indi&s;pen&s;able. No al|liances, however &s;trict, between the parts, can be an adequate &s;ub&s;titute; they will inevitably experience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have experienced. Sen&s;ible of this mo|mentous truth, you have improved upon your fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, by the adoption of a con&s;titution of a govern|ment, better calculated than your former, for an in|timate Union, and for the efficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the off|&s;pring of your own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full inve&s;tigation and mature delibera|tion, completely free in its principles, in the di&s;tribu|tion of its powers, uniting &s;ecurity with energy, and containing within it&s;elf a provi&s;ion for its own a|mendment, has a ju&s;t claim to your confidence and your &s;upport. Re&s;pect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquie&s;cence in its mea&s;ures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty.
<PB N="29" REF="038170_0026_101114AFDB2510F0">
The ba&s;is of our political &s;y&s;tems is the right of the people to make and to alter their con&s;titutions of government. But, the con&s;titution which at any time exi&s;ts, till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is &s;acredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of the people to e&s;tabli&s;h government, pre&s;uppo&s;es the duty of every individual to obey the e&s;tabli&s;hed government.</P>
<P>All ob&s;tructions to the execution of the Laws, all combinations and a&s;&s;ociations, under whatever plau|&s;ible character, with the real de&s;ign to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the con&s;tituted authorities, are de&s;tructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They &s;erve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the dele|gated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a &s;mall, but artful and enterpri&s;ing minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public admini&s;tration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous pro|jects of faction, rather than the organ of con&s;i&s;tent and whole&s;ome plans, dige&s;ted by common councils and modified by mutual intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>However combinations, or a&s;&s;ociations, of the a|bove de&s;cription, may now and then an&s;wer popular ends, they are likely, in the cour&s;e of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambi|tious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to &s;ub|vert the power of the people, and to u&s;urp for them|&s;elves the reins of government; de&s;troying after|wards the very engines which have lifted them to unju&s;t dominion.</P>
<P>Towards the pre&s;ervation of your government, and the permanency of your pre&s;ent happy &s;tate, it is re|qui&s;ite, not only that you &s;teadily di&s;countenance ir|regular oppo&s;ition to its acknowledged authority, but

al&s;o that you re&s;i&s;t, with care, the &s;pirit of innovation upon its principles, however &s;pecious the pretexts.&mdash; One method of a&s;&s;ault may be to effect, in the forms of the con&s;titution, alterations which will impair the energy of the &s;y&s;tem, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes, to which you may be invited, remember, that time and habit are at lea&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary to fix the true character of government, as of other human in&s;titutions; that experience is the &s;ure&s;t &s;tandard, by which to te&s;t the real tendency of the exi&s;ting con&s;titution of a coun|try; that facility in changes, upon the credit of mere hypothe&s;is and opinion, expo&s;es to perpetual change, from the endle&s;s variety of hypothe&s;is and opinion; and remember, e&s;pecially, that for the efficient man|agement of your common intere&s;t, in a country &s;o ex|ten&s;ive as ours, a government of as much vigour as is con&s;i&s;tent with the perfect &s;ecurity of liberty, is indi&s;|pen&s;able. Liberty it&s;elf will find in &s;uch a govern|ment, with powers properly di&s;tributed and adju&s;ted, its &s;ure&s;t guardian. It is, indeed, little el&s;e than a name, where the government is too feeble to with|&s;tand the enterpri&s;es of faction, to confine each mem|ber of the &s;ociety within the limits pre&s;cribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the &s;ecure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of per&s;on and property.</P>
<P>I have already intimated to you, the danger of parties in the &s;tate, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical di&s;criminations. Let me now take a more comprehen&s;ive view, and warn you, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, again&s;t the baneful effects of the &s;pirit of party, generally.</P>
<P>This &s;pirit, unfortunately, is in&s;eparable from our nature, having its root in the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of the human mind. It exi&s;ts, under different &s;hapes, in all governments&mdash;more or le&s;s &s;tifled, controled, or re|pre&s;&s;ed; but in tho&s;e of the popular form, it is &s;een in
<PB N="31" REF="038170_0028_101114B816284978">
its greate&s;t rankne&s;s, and is truly their wor&s;t enemy.</P>
<P>The alternate domination of one faction over an|other, &s;harpened by the &s;pirit of revenge, natural to party di&s;&s;ention, which, in different ages and coun|tries, has perpetrated the mo&s;t horrid enormities, is it&s;elf a frightful de&s;poti&s;m: but this leads at length to a more formal and permanent de&s;poti&s;m. The di&s;orders and mi&s;eries, which re&s;ult, gradually incline the minds of men to &s;eek &s;ecurity and repo&s;e in the ab&s;olute power of an individual; and, &s;ooner or later, the chief of &s;ome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this di&s;po&s;ition to the purpo&s;es of his own elevation, on the ruins of Public Liberty.</P>
<P>Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which neverthele&s;s ought not to be entirely out of &s;ight), the common and continual mi&s;chiefs of the &s;pirit of party are &s;ufficient to make it the intere&s;t and duty of a wi&s;e people to di&s;courage and re&s;train it.</P>
<P>It &s;erves always to di&s;tract the Public Councils, and enfeeble the Public Admini&s;tration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealou&s;ies and fal&s;e alarms; kindles the animo&s;ity of one part again&s;t another, and foments, occa&s;ionally, riot and in&s;urrec|tion. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated acce&s;s to the gov|ernment it&s;elf through the channels of party pa&s;&s;ions. Thus the policy and will of one country are &s;ubject|ed to the policy and will of another.</P>
<P>There is an opinion, that parties in free countries are u&s;eful checks upon the admini&s;tration of the gov|ernment, and &s;erve to keep alive the &s;pirit of Liberty. This, within certain limits, is probably true; and in governments of a monarchical ca&s;t, patrioti&s;m may look with indulgence, if not with favour, upon the &s;pirit of party. But in tho&s;e of the popular charac|ter, in governments purely elective, it is a &s;pirit not
<PB N="32" REF="038170_0029_101114B99BB6A290">
to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain, there will always be enough of that &s;pirit for every &s;alutary purpo&s;e. And there being con|&s;tant danger of exce&s;s, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate and a&s;&s;uage it: a fire not to be quenched, it demands uniform vigi|lance to prevent its bur&s;ting into a flame, le&s;t, in&s;tead of warming, it &s;hould con&s;ume.</P>
<P>It is important, likewi&s;e, that the habits of thinking, in a free country, &s;hould in&s;pire caution, in tho&s;e en|tru&s;ted with its admini&s;tration, to confine them&s;elves within their re&s;pective con&s;titutional &s;pheres, avoiding in the exerci&s;e of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The &s;pirit of encroachment tends to con&s;olidate the powers of all the depart|ments in one; and thus to create, whatever be the form of Government, a real de&s;poti&s;m. A ju&s;t e&s;ti|mate of that love of power, and pronene&s;s to abu&s;e it, which predominates in the human heart, is &s;uffi|cient to &s;atisfy us of the truth of this po&s;ition. The nece&s;&s;ity of reciprocal checks in the exerci&s;e of the political power, by dividing and di&s;tributing it into different depo&s;itories, and con&s;tituting each the guar|dian of the public weal again&s;t inva&s;ions by the oth|ers, has been evinced by experiments, ancient and modern; &s;ome of them in our country, and under our own eyes. To pre&s;erve them, mu&s;t be as nece&s;|&s;ary as to in&s;titute them. If, in the opinion of the people, the di&s;tribution or modification of the con&s;ti|tutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the con&s;titution de&s;ignates: but let there be no change by u&s;urpation; for though this, in one in&s;tance, may be the in&s;trument of good, it is the cu&s;tomary wea|pon, by which free governments are de&s;troyed. The precedent mu&s;t always greatly overbalance, in perma|nent evil, any partial or tran&s;ient benefit which the u&s;e can at any time yield.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="038170_0030_101114BB237BC168">Of all the di&s;po&s;itions and habits, which lead to political pro&s;perity, Religion and Morality are indi&s;|pen&s;able &s;upports. In vain would that Man claim the tribute of Patrioti&s;m, who would labour to &s;ub|vert the&s;e great pillars of human happine&s;s, the&s;e firme&s;t props of the duties of Men and Citizens.&mdash; The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to re&s;pect and to cheri&s;h them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with private and public felicity. Let it &s;imply be a&s;ked, where is the &s;ecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if the &s;en&s;e of religious obligation de&s;ert the oaths which are the in&s;truments of inve&s;tigation in courts of ju&s;|tice? and let us with caution indulge the &s;uppo&s;ition, that Morality can be maintained without Religion. Whatever may be conceded of the influence of refin|ed education on minds of peculiar &s;tructure, rea&s;on and experience both forbid us to expect that national Morality can prevail in exclu&s;ion of religious principle.</P>
<P>It is &s;ub&s;tantially true, that virtue or morality is a nece&s;&s;ary &s;pring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends, with more or le&s;s force, to every &s;pecies of free government. Who that is a &s;incere friend to it, can look with indifference upon attempts to &s;hake the foundation of the fabric?</P>
<P>Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, in&s;titutions for the general diffu&s;ion of knowledge. In proportion as the &s;tructure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is e&s;&s;ential that public opinion &s;hould be enlightened.</P>
<P>As a very important &s;ource of &s;trength and &s;ecu|rity, cheri&s;h public credit. One method of pre&s;erv|ing it, is to u&s;e it as &s;paringly as po&s;&s;ible; avoiding oc|ca&s;ions of expen&s;e by cultivating peace; but remem|bering al&s;o, that timely di&s;bur&s;ements, to prepare for danger, frequently prevent much greater di&s;bur&s;e|ments to repel it: avoiding, likewi&s;e, the accumula|tion
<PB N="34" REF="038170_0031_101114BFF60A4A20">
of debt, not only by &s;hunning occa&s;ions of ex|pen&s;e, but by vigorous exertions, in time of peace, to di&s;charge the debts which unavoidable wars may have occa&s;ioned, not ungenerou&s;ly throwing upon po&s;terity the burden which we our&s;elves ought to bear. The execution of the&s;e maxims belongs to your repre&s;entatives, but it is nece&s;&s;ary that public opinion &s;hould co-operate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is e&s;&s;ential that you &s;hould practically bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there mu&s;t be revenue; that to have revenue, there mu&s;t be taxes; and none can be devi&s;ed, which are not, more or le&s;s, inconvenient and unplea&s;ant; that the intrin&s;ic embarra&s;&s;ment in|&s;eparable from the &s;election of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a deci&s;ive motive for a candid con&s;truction of the conduct of the government in making it, and for a &s;pirit of acquie&s;cence in the mea&s;ures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve good faith and ju&s;tice towards all nations; cultivate peace and harmony with all: Religion and Morality enjoin this conduct; and can it be, that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened, and (at no di&s;tant pe|riod) a great nation, to give to mankind the mag|nanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted ju&s;tice and benevolence. Who can doubt, that in the cour&s;e of time and things, the fruits of &s;uch a plan would richly repay any tempo|rary advantages which might be lo&s;t by a &s;teady ad|herence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a nation with Virtue? The experiment, at lea&s;t, is recommended by every &s;entiment which ennobles human nature. Alas! is it rendered impo&s;&s;ible by its vices?</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="038170_0032_101114C5180DDA28">In the execution of &s;uch a plan, nothing is more e&s;&s;ential than that permanent, inveterate antipathies again&s;t particular nations, and pa&s;&s;ionate attachments for others, &s;hould be excluded; and that, in the place of them, ju&s;t and amicable feelings towards all &s;hould be cultivated. The nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondne&s;s, is in &s;ome degree a &s;lave. It is a &s;lave to its animo&s;|ity or to its affection, either of which is &s;ufficient to lead it a&s;tray from its duty and its intere&s;t. Antip|athy in one nation again&s;t another, di&s;po&s;es each more readily to offer in&s;ult and injury, to lay hold of &s;light cau&s;es of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when accidental or trifling occa&s;ions of di&s;pute occur.</P>
<P>Hence frequent colli&s;ions, ob&s;tinate, envenomed and bloody conte&s;ts. The nation, prompted by ill-will and re&s;entment, &s;ometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the be&s;t calculations of pol|icy. The government &s;ometimes participates in the national propen&s;ity, and adopts through pa&s;&s;ion what rea&s;on would reject; at other times, it makes the animo&s;ity of the nation &s;ub&s;ervient to projects of ho&s;|tility, in&s;tigated by pride, ambition, and other &s;ini&s;ter and pernicious motives. The peace often, &s;ometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.</P>
<P>So, likewi&s;e, a pa&s;&s;ionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favourite Nation, facilitating the illu&s;ion of an imaginary common intere&s;t, in ca&s;es where no real common intere&s;t exi&s;ts, and infu&s;ing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a par|ticipation in the quarrels and wars of the latter, with|out adequate inducement or ju&s;tification. It leads al&s;o to conce&s;&s;ions to the favourite nation of privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the conce&s;&s;ions, by unnece&s;&s;arily part|ing
<PB N="36" REF="038170_0033_1010DD42F8A3D8F0">
with what ought to have been retained, and by ex|citing jealou&s;y, ill-will, and a di&s;po&s;ition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld: and it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citi|zens (who devote them&s;elves to the favourite nation) facility to betray, or &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts of their own country, without odium, &s;ometimes even with popularity; gilding, with the appearances of a vir|tuous &s;en&s;e of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the ba&s;e or fooli&s;h compliances of ambition, corrup|tion, or infatuation.</P>
<P>As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, &s;uch attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with dome&s;tic factions, to practi&s;e the arts of &s;eduction, to mi&s;lead public opinion, to influence or awe the public coun&s;els; &s;uch an attachment of a &s;mall or weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the for|mer to be the &s;atellite of the latter.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the in&s;idious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow citizens), the jea|lou&s;y of a free people ought to be <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> awake; &s;ince hi&s;tory and experience prove, that foreign in|fluence is one of the mo&s;t baneful foes of republican government. But that jealou&s;y, to be u&s;eful, mu&s;t be impartial; el&s;e it becomes the in&s;trument of the very influence to be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ided, in&s;tead of a defence again&s;t it. Exce&s;&s;ive partiality for one foreign nation, and exce&s;&s;ive di&s;like of another, cau&s;e tho&s;e whom they actuate to &s;ee danger only on one &s;ide, and &s;erve to veil, and even &s;econd the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may re&s;i&s;t the intrigues of the favourite, are liable to become &s;u&s;pected and odi|ous; while its tools and dupes u&s;urp the applau&s;e and confidence of the people, to &s;urrender their intere&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="038170_0034_101114CA2DBAC598">The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, in extending our commercial re|lations, to have with them as little <HI>political</HI> connexion as po&s;&s;ible. So far as we have already formed en|gagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us &s;top.</P>
<P><HI>Europe</HI> has a &s;et of primary intere&s;ts, which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence &s;he mu&s;t be engaged in frequent controver&s;ies, the cau&s;es of which are e&s;&s;entially foreign to our concerns.&mdash; Hence, therefore, it mu&s;t be unwi&s;e in us to impli|cate our&s;elves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vici&s;|&s;itudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and colli&s;ions of her friend&s;hips or enmities.</P>
<P>Our detached and di&s;tant &s;ituation invites and en|ables us to pur&s;ue a different cour&s;e. If we remain one people, under an efficient government, the period is not far off, when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take &s;uch an at|titude as will cau&s;e the neutrality, we may at any time re&s;olve upon, to be &s;crupulou&s;ly re&s;pected; when belligerent nations, under the impo&s;&s;ibility of making acqui&s;itions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giv|ing us provocation; when we may choo&s;e peace or war, as our intere&s;t, guided by ju&s;tice, &s;hall coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Why forego the advantages of &s;o peculiar a &s;itua|tion? Why quit our own, to &s;tand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our de&s;tiny with that of any part of Europe <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">tangle our peace and pro&s;perity in the toils of European ambition, rival|&s;hip, intere&s;t, humour, or caprice?</P>
<P>It is our true policy to &s;teer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world; &s;o far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be under&s;tood, as capable of patronizing infidelity to exi&s;ting engagements. I hold the max|im no le&s;s applicable to public than to private affairs,
<PB N="38" REF="038170_0035_101114CF305EEF40">
that hone&s;ty is always the be&s;t policy. I repeat it, therefore, let tho&s;e engagements be ob&s;erved in their genuine &s;en&s;e. But, in my opinion, it is unnece&s;&s;ary, and would be unwi&s;e to extend them.</P>
<P>Taking care always to keep our&s;elves, by &s;uitable e&s;tabli&s;hments, on a re&s;pectable defen&s;ive po&s;ture, we may &s;afely tru&s;t to temporary alliances for extraor|dinary emergencies.</P>
<P>Harmony, liberal intercour&s;e with all nations, are recommended by policy, humanity, and intere&s;t. But even our commercial policy &s;hould hold an equal and impartial hand; neither &s;ending or granting exclu&s;ive favours or preferences; con&s;ulting the natural cour&s;e of things; diffu&s;ing and diver&s;ifying, by gentle means, the &s;treams of commerce, but forcing nothing; e&s;tab|li&s;hing, with powers &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, in order to give trade a &s;table cour&s;e, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the government to &s;upport them, con|ventional rules of intercour&s;e, the be&s;t that pre&s;ent circum&s;tances and mutual opinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be, from time to time, aban|doned or varied, as experience and circum&s;tances &s;hall dictate; con&s;tantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for di&s;intere&s;ted favours from another; that it mu&s;t pay, with a portion of its independence, for whatever it may accept under that character; that, by &s;uch acceptance, it may place it&s;elf in the condition of having given equivalents for nominal favours, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> being reproached with in|gratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to expect, or calculate upon real favours from nation to nation. It is an illu&s;ion which experi|ence mu&s;t cure, which a ju&s;t pride ought to di&s;card.</P>
<P>In offering to you, my countrymen, the&s;e coun&s;els of an old affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the &s;trong and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion I could wi&s;h; that they will control the u&s;ual current of the

<P>How far, in the di&s;charge of my official duties, I have been guided by the principles which have been delineated, the public records, and other evidences of my conduct, mu&s;t witne&s;s to you and to the world.

<P>In relation to the &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting war in Europe, my Proclamation of the 22d of April, 1795, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice, and by that of your Repre&s;entatives in both Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, the &s;pirit of that mea&s;ure has continu|ally governed me; uninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.</P>
<P>After deliberate examination, with the aid of the be&s;t lights I could obtain, I was well &s;atisfied that our country, under all the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, had a right to take, and was bound in duty and intere&s;t to take a neutral po&s;ition. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">ng taken it, I deter|mined, as far as &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> on me, to maintain it, with moderation.</P>

I will only ob&s;erve, that according to my under&s;tanding of the matter, that right, &s;o far from being denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually admitted by all.</P>
<P>The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be in|ferred,
<PB N="40" REF="038170_0037_101114D3D4CF3D70">
without any thing more, from the obligation which ju&s;tice and humanity impo&s;e on every nation, in ca&s;es in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.</P>
<P>The inducements of intere&s;t for ob&s;erv<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> that con|duct will be&s;t be referred to your own reflections and experience.

<P>Though in reviewing the incidents of my admini|&s;tration, I am uncon&s;cious of intentional error; I am neverthele&s;s too &s;en&s;ible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors.
