<HEAD>TRUE STORY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>A Lieutenant of a regiment in gar|ri&s;on at St. Chri&s;topher's died, and left his &s;on an orphan. A particu|lar family had promi&s;ed him on his death|bed to take care of his boy, but he was wholly abandoned, and forced to keep among the negro children, and live on &s;uch &s;craps as he could find.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate, he caught that loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;e called the Yaws, which became a new rea&s;on for giving him up to his fate.</P>
<P>In this condition BABAY, a poor ne|gro woman, found him, took him to her hut, got him cured, and divided what food &s;he had with him, till he was able to work for him&s;elf. The fir&s;t mo|ney that he earned, went to purcha&s;e her freedom.</P>

He was pro&s;perous in the world, and took her home to his hou&s;e and as long as &s;he lived afterwards, which might be upwards of forty years, treated her with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful kindne&s;s. He gave her a very expen&s;ive burial, and had a funeral &s;ermon preached over her. As this &s;ermon was delivered before people acquainted with her character, and men|tioned &s;uch circum&s;tances as I wi&s;h here to remark, I &s;hall give an extract of what was addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;laves that attended her.</P>
<P>"This good woman was like many of you a &s;lave, and as &s;uch laboured under every di&s;advantage, which you can plead, for not doing her duty; yet, in this &s;ituation, &s;he &s;hewed in her conduct the noble&s;t fruits of religion and charity; a helple&s;s child, left an orphan in a &s;trange country, far from relations, or even acquaintance to his family, aban|doned by tho&s;e who undertook to rai&s;e him, from her alone could rai&s;e pity, or engage attention, when left by all of his own rank and colour, to peri&s;h in a loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;e, though &s;on to a &s;er|vant

of the Public, with whom every true lover of his Country &s;hould have &s;ympathized. She alone lodged him, nur&s;ed him carefully, got him cured, and put him into a way to provide for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Take notice this woman was a chri&s;|tian, and you will cea&s;e to wonder. This in&s;tance of genero&s;ity found in one of her condition, is a proof that noble and great actions are not, as many think, con|fined to advantages of birth and educa|tion, for &s;he had nothing to direct her but GOD'S grace working on a tracta|ble heart, and this benevolent temper, &s;hewed it&s;elf in every part of her beha|viour through life, and was accompani|ed in her, with a true &s;en&s;e of religion; or to &s;peak more truly, &s;he was charita|ble becau&s;e &s;he was religious.</P>
<P>She was well in&s;tructed in what &s;he ought to know, and believe, and always acted upon tho&s;e chri&s;tian principles &s;he profe&s;&s;ed to believe. She always &s;poke on religious &s;ubjects, with an
