<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you want to make me believe that there are two ways of keep|ing the commandments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! but there may be two ways of under&s;tanding them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! I am not afraid to be put to the proof, I defy any man to &s;ay I do not keep at lea&s;t the four fir&s;t that are on the left &s;ide of the altar piece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you can prove that, I &s;hall be more ready to believe you ob&s;erve tho&s;e of the other table, for he who does his du|ty to God will be likely to do his duty to his neighbour al&s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! do you think that I &s;erve two Gods? Do you think then that I make graven images, and wor&s;hip &s;tocks or &s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">es? Do you take me for a Papi&s;t or an Idolator?</P>

<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't triumph quite &s;o &s;oon ma&s;ter Bragwell. Pray is there nothing in the world you prefer to GOD, and thus make an idol of? Do you not love your money or your lands, or your crops, or your cattle, or your own will, and your own way rather better than you love GOD? Do you never think of the&s;e with more plea&s;ure than you think of Him, and fol|low them more eagerly than your religi|ous duty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>O there's nothing about that in the 20th chapter of Exodus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Je&s;us Chri&s;t has &s;aid. "He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me." Now it is certainly a man's duty to love his father and mother, nay, it would be wicked not to love them, and yet we mu&s;t not love even the&s;e more than our Creator and our Saviour. Well, I think on this principle, your heart pleads guilty to the breach of the fir&s;t and &s;econd commandments, let us proceed to the third.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is about &s;wearing, is it not!</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="037133_0004_100C922767661EE0">
Mr. Worthy, who had ob&s;erved Brag|well guilty of much profanene&s;s in u&s;ing the name of his maker, (though all &s;uch offen&s;ive words have been avoided in wri|ting this hi&s;tory) now told him that he had been waiting the whole day for an opportunity to reprove him, for his fre|quent breach of the third commandment.</P>
<P>Good L&mdash;d, I break the third command|ment; &s;aid Bragwell, no indeed hardly ever. I once u&s;ed to &s;wear a little to be &s;ure, but I vow to G&mdash;d I never do it now except now and then, when I happen to be in a pa&s;&s;ion: and in &s;uch a ca&s;e, why good G&mdash;d, you know the &s;in is with tho&s;e who provoke me and not with me, but, upon my &s;oul, I don't think I have &s;worn an oath the&s;e three months; no not I faith, as I hope to be &s;aved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you have broken this holy law no le&s;s than five or &s;ix times in the la&s;t &s;peech you have made.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord ble&s;s me. Sure you mi&s;|take. Good heavens, Mr. Worthy, I call G&mdash;d to witne&s;s I have neither cur|&s;ed
<PB N="5" REF="037133_0005_100C9228F35290A8">
nor &s;wore &s;ince I have been in the hou&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Bragwell this is the way in which many who call them&s;elves very good &s;ort of people deceive them|&s;elves. What is it no profanation of the name of God to u&s;e it lightly, irreverently and familiarly as you have done? Our Saviour has not only told us not to &s;wear by the immediate name of God, but he has &s;aid, &s;wear not at all, neither by hea|ven nor by the earth, and in order to pre|vent our inventing any other irreligious exclamations or expre&s;&s;ions, he has even added, but let your communication be yea, yea, and nay, nay, for what&s;oever is more than this &s;imple affirmation and denial cometh of evil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I mu&s;t take a little more care I believe, I vow to hea|ven I did not know there had been &s;o much harm in it, but my daughters &s;el|dom &s;peak without u&s;ing &s;ome of the&s;e words, and yet they wanted to make me believe the other day that it was mon|&s;trous vulgar to &s;wear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="037133_0006_100C922AE0C849C8">
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Women, even gentlewomen, who ought to correct this evil habit in their fathers, and hu&s;bands, and children, are too apt to encourage it by their own practice. And indeed they betray the profanene&s;s of their own minds al&s;o by it, for none who truly venerate the holy name of God, can either profane it in this manner them&s;elves, or hear others do &s;o without being exceedingly pained at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, &s;ince you are &s;o hard upon me I believe I mu&s;t e'en give up this point&mdash;&s;o let us pa&s;s on to the next, and here I tread upon &s;ure ground, for as &s;harp as you are upon me, you can't accu&s;e me of being a &s;abbath-breaker, &s;ince I go to church every Sunday of my life unle&s;s on &s;ome very extraordinary oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>For tho&s;e occa&s;ions the go&s;|pel allows, by &s;aying, "the &s;abbath was made for man and not man for the &s;ab|bath." Our own &s;ickne&s;s or attending on the &s;ickne&s;s of others are lawful impe|diments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="037133_0007_100C922CC76CB9F0">
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and I am now and then obliged to look at a drove of bea&s;ts, or to go a journey, or to take &s;ome medi|cine, or perhaps &s;ome friend may call up|no me, or it may be very cold, or very hot or very rainy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor excu&s;es Mr. Bragwell, I am afraid the&s;e will not pa&s;s on the day of judgment. But how is the re&s;t of your Sunday &s;pent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>O why I a&s;&s;ure you, I often go to church in the afternoon al&s;o, and e|ven if I am ever &s;o &s;leepy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o you fini&s;h your nap at church I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why as to that to be &s;ure we do contrive to have &s;omething a little nicer than common for dinner on a Sun|day; in con&s;equence of which one eats you know a little more than ordinary; and having nothing to do on that day, one has more lei&s;ure to take a cheerful gla&s;s; and all the&s;e things will make one a lit|tle heavy you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="037133_0008_100C922EF7838858">
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And don't you take a little ride in the morning, and look at your &s;heep when the weather is good, and &s;o fill your mind ju&s;t before you go to church with the thoughts of them, and when you come away again don't you &s;ettle an ac|count, or write a few letters of bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't &s;ay but I do, but that is nothing to any body as long as I &s;et a good example by keeping to my church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how do you pa&s;s your Sunday evenings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>My wi&s;e and daughters go a vi&s;iting of a &s;unday afternoon. My daughters are glad to get out at any rate, and as to my wife, &s;he &s;ays, that being ready dre&s;&s;ed it is a pity to lo&s;e the op|portunity, be&s;ides it &s;aves her time on a week day; &s;o then you &s;ee I have it all my own way, and when I have got rid of the ladies, who are ready to faint at the &s;mell of tobacco, I can venture to &s;moak a pipe and drink a &s;ober gla&s;s of punch with half a dozen friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which punch being made of &s;muggled brandy, and drank on the Lord's day in very vain, as well as pro|fane and worldly company, you are ena|bled
<PB N="9" REF="037133_0009_100C92312F597D90">
to break both the law of GOD and that of your country at a &s;troke: and I &s;uppo&s;e when you get together, you &s;peak of your cattle or of your crops, after which perhaps you talk over a few of your neigh|bours faults, and then you brag a little of your own wealth or your own atchiev|ments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you &s;eem to know us &s;o well, that any one would think you had been &s;itting behind the curtain, and yet you are a little mi&s;taken too, for I think we have hardly &s;aid a word for &s;e|veral of our la&s;t Sundays on any thing but politics.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you find that you improve your Chri&s;tian charity by that &s;ubject?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to be &s;ure we do quar|rel 'till we are very near fighting, that is the wor&s;t on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then you call names and &s;wear a little I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why when one is contra|dicted and put in a pa&s;&s;ion you know fle&s;h and blood can't bear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when all your friends are gone home what becomes of the re&s;t of the evening?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="037133_0010_100C9232E50FA3F0">
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is ju&s;t as it happens, &s;ometimes I read the new&s;paper; and as one is generally mo&s;t tired on the days one does nothing, I go to-bed earlier than on other days, that I may be more fit to get up to my bu&s;ine&s;s the next morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you &s;horten Sunday as much as you can, by cutting off a bit at both ends I &s;uppo&s;e, for I take it for granted you lie a little later in the morn|ing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Come. We &s;han't get through the whole ten to-night if you &s;tand &s;nubbing one at this rate. You may pa&s;s over the fifth, for my father and mo|ther have been dead &s;ince I was a boy, &s;o I am clear of that &s;crape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are however many re|lative duties in that commandment; un|kindne&s;s to all kindred is forbidden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>O if you mean my turning off my nephew Tom, the plowboy, you mu&s;t not blame me for that, it was all my wife's fault. He was as good a lad as ever lived to be &s;ure, and my own bro|ther's &s;on, but my wife could not bear that a boy in a carter's frock &s;hould be about the hou&s;e who called her aunt. We quarrelled like dog and cat about it; and
<PB N="11" REF="037133_0011_100C9235237A4A68">
when he was turned away we did not &s;peak for a week.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which was a fre&s;h breach of the commandment, a worthy nephew turned out of doors, and a wife not &s;po|ken to for a week, are no very convin|cing proofs of your ob&s;ervance of the fifth commandment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well I long to come to the &s;ixth for you don't think I commit mur|der I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not &s;ure of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>What kill any body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the laws of the land in|deed and the di&s;grace attending it are al|mo&s;t enough to keep any man from actu|al murder; let me a&s;k however, do you never give way to unju&s;t anger, and pa&s;|&s;ion, and revenge? as for in&s;tance, do you never feel your re&s;entment kindle again&s;t &s;ome of the politicians who con|tradict you on a Sunday night? and do you never pu&s;h your animo&s;ity again&s;t &s;omebody that has affronted you, further than the occa&s;ion will ju&s;tify?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Harkee Mr. Worthy, I am a man of &s;ub&s;tance, and nobody, &s;hall of|fend me without my being even with him. So as to injuring a man, if he affronts me
<PB N="12" REF="037133_0012_100C923705B92620">
fir&s;t there's nothing but good rea&s;on in that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well! only bear in mind that you wilfully break this com|mandment, whether you abu&s;e your &s;er|vant, are angry at your wife, watch for a moment to revenge an injury on your neighbour, or even wreak your pa&s;&s;ion on a harmle&s;s bea&s;t; for you have then the &s;eeds of murder working in your brea&s;t; and if there were no law, no gibbet to check you, and no fear of di&s;grace nei|ther, I am not &s;ure where you would &s;top.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Mr. Worthy you have a &s;trange way of explaining the com|mandments, &s;o you &s;et me down for a murderer merely becau&s;e I bear hatred to a man who has done me a hurt, and am glad to do him a like injury in my turn.&mdash;I am &s;ure I &s;hould want &s;pirit if I did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I go by the &s;cripture rule, which &s;ays, "he that hateth his brother is a murderer," and again "love your e|nemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, and pray for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e you and per&s;ecute you." Be&s;ides, Mr. Brag|well you made it a part of your boa&s;t that you &s;aid the Lord's prayer every day,
<PB N="13" REF="037133_0013_100C923891CB3CA0">
wherein you pray to God to forgive you your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es as you forgive them that tre&s;spa&s;s again&s;t you.&mdash;If therefore you do not forgive them that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t you, in that ca&s;e, you pray daily that your own tre&s;pa&s;&s;es may never be forgiven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, come let us make ha&s;te and get through the&s;e command|ments. The next is, "thou &s;halt not commit adultry," thank God neither I nor my family can be &s;aid to break the &s;eventh commandment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here again, remember how Chri&s;t him&s;elf hath &s;aid, "who&s;o looketh on a woman to lu&s;t after her, hath alrea|dy committed adultry with her in his heart." The&s;e are no far fetched expre&s;|&s;ions of mine. Mr. Bragwell, they are the words of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I hope you will not charge him with having carried things too far, for if you do, you charge him with being mi&s;taken in the religion he taught, and this can only be accounted for by &s;uppo&s;ing him an impo&s;tor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why upon my word, Mr. Worthy, I dont like the&s;e &s;ayings of his, which you quote upon me &s;o often, and that is the truth of it, and I can't &s;ay I feel much di&s;po&s;ed to believe them.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="037133_0014_100C923AB0CC62C8">
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I hope you believe that creed of yours, which you al&s;o boa&s;ted of your re|peating &s;o regularly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I'll believe any thing you &s;ay rather than &s;tand quar|relling with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope then you will allow, that &s;ince it is committing adultry to look at a woman with even an irregular thought, it follows from the &s;ame rule, that all immode&s;t dre&s;s in your daughters, or in|decent je&s;ts and double meanings in your&s;elf, all loo&s;e &s;ongs or novels, and all diver&s;ions al&s;o which have a like dan|gerous tendency, are forbidden by the &s;eventh commandment; for it is mo&s;t plain from what Chri&s;t has &s;aid, that it takes in not only the act but the inclina|tion, the de&s;ire, the indulged imagination, the act is only the la&s;t and highe&s;t degree of any &s;in, the topmo&s;t round as if it were of a ladder, to which all the lower rounds are only as &s;o many &s;teps and &s;tages.</P>

<P>No, nor have you ever been under any temptation to do it, and yet there are a thou&s;and ways of breaking the eighth commandment be&s;ides actual &s;teal|ing, for in&s;tance, do you never hide the faults of the goods you &s;ell, and heighten the faults of tho&s;e you buy? Do you never take advantage of an ignorant dealer, and a&s;k more for a thing than it is worth? Do you never turn the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tan|ces of a man who has &s;omething to &s;ell, to your own unfair benefit, and thus act as unju&s;tly by him as if you had &s;tolen? Do you never cut off a &s;hilling from a work|man's wages under a pretence which your con&s;cience can't ju&s;tify? Do you ne|ver pa&s;s off an un&s;ound hor&s;e, for a &s;ound one?

<P>Pooh! the&s;e things are do|ing every day. I &s;han't go to &s;et up for being better than my neighbours in the&s;e &s;ort of things, the&s;e little matters will pa&s;s mu&s;ter.&mdash;I don't &s;et up for a refor|mer.&mdash;If I am as good as the re&s;t of my

a regard to that part of it, the breach of which does not touch our own intere&s;t as to that which does.

<P>Mr. Bragwell was more affected than he cared to own. He went to-bed with le&s;s &s;pirits and more humility than u&s;ual. He did not however care to let Mr. Wor|thy &s;ee the impre&s;&s;ion which it had made upon him; but at parting next morning, he &s;hook him by the hand more cordially than u&s;ual, and made him promi&s;e to re|turn his vi&s;it in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>Mr Bragwell when he returned home from his vi&s;it to Mr. Worthy found that he was not quite &s;o happy as he had for|merly been. The di&s;cour&s;es of Mr. Worthy had broken in not a little upon his comfort. And he began to &s;u&s;pect that he was not &s;o completely in the right as his vanity had led him to believe. He &s;eemed al&s;o to feel le&s;s &s;atisfaction in the idle gentility of his own daughters, &s;ince he had been witne&s;s to the &s;implicity, mo|de&s;ty, and u&s;efulne&s;s of tho&s;e of Mr. Wor|thy. And he could not help &s;eeing that the vulgar violence of his wife did not produce &s;o much family happine&s;s at home, as the humble piety and quiet di|ligence
<PB N="23" REF="037133_0023_100C924A69B2E188">
of Mrs. Worthy produced in the hou&s;e of his friend.</P>
<P>Happy would it have been for Mr, Bragwell, if he had followed up tho&s;e new convictions of his own mind, which would have led him to &s;truggle again&s;t the power of evil principles in him&s;elf, and to have controuled the force of evil habits in his family. But his con|victions were ju&s;t &s;trong enough to make him unea&s;y under his errors, without dri|ving him to reform them. The &s;light impre&s;&s;ion &s;oon wore off, and he fell back into his old practices. Still his e&s;teem for Mr. Worthy was not at all abated by the plain dealing of that hone&s;t friend. It is true he dreaded his piercing eye. He felt that his example held out a con|&s;tant reproof to him&s;elf. Yet &s;uch is the force of early affection and rooted rever|ence, that he longed to &s;ee him at his hou&s;e. This de&s;ire, indeed, as is com|monly the ca&s;e, was made up of mixed motives. He wi&s;hed for the plea&s;ure of his friend's company; he longed for that favorite triumph of a vulgar mind, an op|portunity of &s;hewing him his riches; and he thought it would rai&s;e his credit in the
<PB N="24" REF="037133_0024_100C924CE8095FD8">
world to have a man of Mr. Worthy's character at his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell, It is true, &s;till went on with the &s;ame eagerne&s;s in gaining mo|ney, and the &s;ame o&s;tentation in &s;pending it. But though he was as covetous as ever, he was not quite &s;o &s;ure that it was right to be &s;o. At Chri&s;tmas, indeed, while he was actually engaged abroad in tran&s;actions with his dealers, he was not very &s;crupulous about the means by which he <HI>got</HI> his money; and while he was in|dulging in fe&s;tivity with his friends at home, he was ea&s;y enough as to the man|ner in which he <HI>spent</HI> it. But a man can neither be making bargains nor making fea&s;ts always; there mu&s;t be &s;ome inter|vals between the&s;e two great objects for which worldly men may be &s;aid to live; and in &s;ome of the&s;e intervals the mo&s;t worldly, form perhaps &s;ome random plans of amendment. And though many a one may &s;ay in the fullne&s;s of enjoyment, "to-morrow &s;hall be as this day, and more abundant;" yet hardly any man perhaps allows him&s;elf to &s;ay, even in his mo&s;t &s;ecret moments, "I will <HI>never</HI> retire from bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;I will <HI>never</HI> repent
<PB N="25" REF="037133_0025_100C924F5111F308">
&mdash;I will <HI>never</HI> think of death. Eternity &s;hall <HI>never</HI> come into my thoughts." The mo&s;t that &s;uch a one probably ventures to &s;ay is, "I need not repent <HI>yet.</HI> I will continue &s;uch a &s;in a little longer, it will be time enough to think on the next world when I am no longer fit for the bu&s;ine&s;s or the plea&s;ures of this."</P>
<P>Such was the ca&s;e with Bragwell. He &s;et up in his own mind a general di&s;tant &s;ort of re&s;olution, that <HI>some years hence,</HI> when he &s;hould be a <HI>few years older,</HI> and a <HI>few</HI> thou&s;ands richer; when a few more of his <HI>present schemes should be compleat|ed,</HI> he would then think of altering his cour&s;e of life. He would then certainly &s;et about &s;pending a religious old age; he would reform &s;ome practices in his deal|ings, or perhaps quit bu&s;ine&s;s entirely; he would think about reading good books, and when he had compleated &s;uch and &s;uch a purcha&s;e, he would even begin to give &s;omething to the poor, but at pre&s;ent he really had little to &s;pare for charity. The very rea&s;on why he &s;hould have gi|ven more, was ju&s;t the cau&s;e he a&s;&s;igned for not giving at all, namely, the <HI>hard|ness of the times.</HI> The true grand &s;ource
<PB N="26" REF="037133_0026_100C9250DDA38A28">
of charity, &s;elf-denial, never came into his head. <HI>Spend less</HI> that you may <HI>save more,</HI> he would have thought a &s;hrewd maxim enough. But <HI>spend less</HI> that you may <HI>spare more,</HI> never entered into his book of Proverbs.</P>
<P>At length the time came when Mr. Worthy had promi&s;ed to return his vi&s;it. It was indeed a little ha&s;tened by notice that Mr. Bragwell would have in the cour&s;e of the week, a piece of land to &s;ell by auction; and though Mr. Worthy be|lieved the price was likely to be above his pocket, yet he knew it was an occa&s;i|on which would be likely to bring the the principle Farmers of that neighbour|hood together, &s;ome of whom he wanted to meet. And it was on this occa&s;ion that Mr. Bragwell prided him&s;elf, that he &s;hould &s;hew his neighbours &s;o &s;en&s;ible a man as his dear friend Mr. Worthy.</P>
<P>Worthy arrived at his friend's hou&s;e on the Saturday, time enough to &s;ee the hou&s;e and garden and grounds of Mr. Bragwell by day-light. He &s;aw with plea|&s;ure for he had a warm and generous heart, tho&s;e evident &s;igns of his friend's
<PB N="27" REF="037133_0027_100C9252C31FE188">
pro&s;perity, but as he was a man of a &s;o|ber mind, and was a mo&s;t exact dealer in truth, he never allowed his tongue the licence of immode&s;t commendation, which he u&s;ed to &s;ay either &s;avoured of flattery or envy. Indeed he never rated mere worldly things &s;o highly as to be&s;tow upon them undue prai&s;e. His calm ap|probation &s;omewhat di&s;appointed the va|nity of Mr. Bragwell, who could not help &s;ecretly &s;u&s;pecting that his friend, as good a man as he was, was not quite free from envy. He felt, however, very much inclined to forgive this jealou&s;y, which he feared the &s;ight of his ample property, and hand&s;ome habitation, mu&s;t naturally awaken in the mind of a man who&s;e own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were &s;o inferior. He practi&s;ed the u&s;ual trick of ordinary and vulgar minds, that of pretending him&s;elf to find fault with tho&s;e things which were particularly de&s;erving prai&s;e, when he found Worthy di&s;po&s;ed to pa&s;s them over in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>When they came in to &s;upper, he af|fected to talk of the comforts of Mr. Worthy's <HI>little</HI> parlour, by way of calling his attention to his own large one. He
<PB N="28" REF="037133_0028_100C9254AB374738">
repeated the word <HI>snug,</HI> as applied to every thing at Mr. Worthy's, with the plain de&s;ign to make compari&s;ons favour|able to his own more ample domains. He contrived, as he pa&s;&s;ed by to his chair, by a &s;eeming accident, to pu&s;h open the door of a large beaufet in the parlour in which all the finery was mo&s;t o&s;tentati|ou&s;ly &s;et out to view. He prote&s;ted, with a look of &s;atisfaction which belied his words; that for his part he did not care a farthing for all this trumpery; and then &s;miling and rubbing his hands, added with an air of no &s;mall importance, "what a good thing it is, though for people of &s;ub&s;tance, that the tax on plate was taken off. You are a happy man, Mr. Worthy, you do not feel the&s;e things, tax or no tax it is all the &s;ame to you." He took care during this &s;peech, by a ca&s;t of his eye, to direct Mr. Wor|thy's attention to a great profu&s;ion of the brighte&s;t cups, &s;alvers, and tankards, and other &s;hining ornaments which crowded the beaufet. Mr. Worthy gravely an|&s;wered, "Mr, Bragwell, it was indeed a tax which could not affect &s;o plain a man as my&s;elf, but as it fell on a mere luxury, and therefore could not hurt the

<P>During &s;upper the young ladies &s;at in di&s;dainful &s;ilence, not deigning to be&s;tow the &s;malle&s;t civility on &s;o plain a man as Mr. Worthy. They left the room with their Mamma as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, being impatient to get away to ridicule their father's friend.</P>

<P>As &s;oon as they were gone, Mr. Wor|thy a&s;ked Bragwell how his family com|forts &s;tood, and how his daughters, who he &s;aid, were really fine young women, went on. "O, as to that," replied Brag|well.
<PB N="30" REF="037133_0030_100C92587B45FEF8">
"pretty much like other men's hand&s;ome daughters, I &s;uppo&s;e, that is wor&s;e and wor&s;e. I really begin to ap|prehend that their fanta&s;tical notions have gained &s;uch a head, that after all the money I have &s;craped together, I &s;hall never get them well married. Bet|&s;ey has ju&s;t lo&s;t as good an offer as any girl could de&s;ire, young Wil&s;on, an ho|ne&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial grazier as any in the coun|ty. He not only knows every thing pro|per for his &s;tation, but is plea&s;ing in his behaviour, and a pretty &s;cholar into the bargain; he reads hi&s;tory books and voy|ages of a winter's evening to his infirm father, in&s;tead of going to the card a&s;&s;em|bly in our town; neither likes drinking nor &s;porting, and is a &s;ort of favourite with our par&s;on, becau&s;e he takes in the weekly numbers of a fine bible with Cuts, and &s;ub&s;cribes to the Sunday School, and makes a fu&s;s about helping the poor, the&s;e dear times as they call them. but I think they are good times for <HI>us,</HI> Mr. Worthy. Well, for all this, Bet&s;y only de&s;pi&s;ed him and laughed at him; but as he is both hand&s;ome and rich, I thought &s;he might come round at la&s;t. And &s;o I in|vited him to come and &s;tay a day or two
<PB N="31" REF="037133_0031_100C925AC7556160">
at Chri&s;tmas, when we have always a lit|tle &s;ort of merry-making here. But it would not do. He &s;corned to talk that palavering &s;tuff which &s;he had been u&s;ed to in the marble covered books I told you of. He told her indeed, that it would be the happine&s;s of his heart to live with her, which I own I thought was as much as could be expected of any man. But Mi&s;s had no notion of marrying one who was only de&s;irous of living with her. No no, for&s;ooth, her lover mu&s;t declare him|&s;elf ready to die for her, which hone&s;t Wil&s;on was not &s;uch a fool as to offer to do. In the afternoon, however, he got a little into her favour by making a Re|bus or two in the Lady's Diary, and &s;he conde&s;cended to &s;ay &s;he did not think Mr. Wil&s;on had been &s;o good a &s;cholar, but he &s;oon &s;poilt all again. We had a bit of a hop in the evening. The young man though he had not much ta&s;te for tho&s;e &s;ort of gambols, yet thought he could foot it a little in the old fa&s;hioned way. So he a&s;ked Bet&s;ey to be his part|ner. But when he a&s;ked what dance they &s;hould call, Mi&s;s drew up her head, and in a &s;trange gibberi&s;h, &s;aid &s;he &s;hould dance nothing but a <HI>Minuet de la Cour,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="037133_0032_100C8324E6AC40D8">
and ordered him to call it; Wil&s;on &s;tared, and hone&s;tly told her &s;he mu&s;t call it her|&s;elf, for he could neither &s;pell nor pro|nounce &s;uch outlandi&s;h words. I bur&s;t out a laughing, and told him, I &s;uppo&s;ed it was &s;omething like que&s;tions and com|mands, and if &s;o, that was much merrier than dancing. Seeing her partner &s;tand|ing &s;tock &s;till, and not knowing how to get out of the &s;crape, the girl began by her&s;elf, and fell to &s;wimming, and &s;ink|ing, and capering, and flouri&s;hing, and po&s;turing, for all the world ju&s;t like the man on the &s;lack rope at our fair. But &s;eeing Wil&s;on &s;tanding like a &s;tuck pig, and we all laughing at her, &s;he re&s;olved to wreak her malice upon him; &s;o with a look of rage and di&s;dain, &s;he advi&s;ed him to go down country bumpkin, with the dairy maid, who would make a much fitter partner, as well as wife, for him than &s;he could. "I am quite of your mind, Mi&s;s," &s;aid he with more &s;pirit than I thought was in him; "you may make a good partner for a dance, but you would make a &s;ad one to go through life with. I will take my leave of you, Mi&s;s, with this &s;hort &s;tory. I had lately a pret|ty large concern in hay-jobbing, which

I thought it bad enough, and wondered the quality could be entertained with &s;uch indecent mummery. But little did I think to meet with the &s;ame paint, finery, and tricks in a farm hou&s;e.

<HI>our</HI> wages, ma&s;ter, and &s;ervants, farmer and labourer. When I &s;ee that one of my men has failed of the wages he &s;hould have received, becau&s;e he has been idling at a fair; another has lo&s;t a day by a drinking bout, a third confe&s;&s;es that though he had ta&s;k-work, and might have earned &s;till more, yet he has been carele&s;s and has not his full pay to receive; this, I &s;ay, &s;ometimes &s;ets me on thinking whether I al&s;o have made the mo&s;t of my time. And when I came to pay even the more diligent who have worked all the week; when I reflect that even the&s;e have done no more than it was their duty to do, I cannot help &s;aying to my&s;elf, night is come, Saturday night is come. No repentance or diligence on the part of the&s;e poor men can now make a bad week's work good. This week is gone into eternity. To-morrow is the &s;ea&s;on of re&s;t; working time is over. My life al&s;o will &s;oon be &s;wallowed up in eterni|ty; &s;oon the &s;pace allotted me for dili|gence, for labour, will be over. Soon will the grand que&s;tion be a&s;ked, 'what ha&s;t thou done? Did&s;t thou u&s;e thy work|ing days to the end for which they were given?' With &s;ome &s;uch thoughts I

<HEAD>Some Account of a Sunday in Mr. Brag|well's Family.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. WORTHY had been for &s;o many years u&s;ed to the &s;ober ways of his own well-ordered family, that he greatly di&s;liked to pa&s;s a Sunday in any hou&s;e of which religion was not the governing principle. Indeed he commonly ordered his affairs, and regulated his journies with an eye to this object. "To pa&s;s a Sunday with an irreligious family," &s;aid he, "is always unplea&s;ant, often un&s;afe. I &s;eldom find I can do them any good, and they may perhaps do me &s;ome harm. At lea&s;t I am giving a &s;anction to their manner of pa&s;&s;ing it, if I pa&s;s it in the &s;ame manner. If I reprove them, I &s;ub|ject my&s;elf to the charge of &s;ingularity, and of being righteous over much; if I do <HI>not</HI> reprove them, I confirm and &s;trengthen them in evil. And whether I reprove them or not, I certainly par|take of their guilt if I &s;pend it as they do."</P>
