<Q><BIBL>2 KINGS, ii. 12.</BIBL>
<P>&mdash;MY FATHER, MY FATHER, THE CHARIOT OF ISRAEL, AND THE HORSEMEN THEREOF!&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN the death of General WASHINGTON was announced, the&s;e &s;ignificant and ex|pre&s;&s;ive words were among the fir&s;t that occurred to my thoughts. They are the words of the prophet Eli&s;ha, on beholding Elijah tran&s;lated from earth to heaven!</P>
<P>THE idea of the many di&s;tingui&s;hed benefits, which this eminent &s;ervant of God and man had conferred on his country, ru&s;hed into his mind, and in&s;pired him with &s;uch an affecting &s;en&s;e of the un&s;peakable lo&s;s, &s;u&s;tained in his departure, that, overwhelmed with grief and regret, he cried out, "My father, my father, the chariot of I&s;rael, and the hor&s;emen thereof!"</P>
<P>THE propriety of this apo&s;trophe will be &s;een and felt by every one, who reflects, that warlike chariots, as well as hor&s;emen, were in general u&s;e, both among
<PB N="6" REF="037438_0003_100D42CB6F211428">
the Jews and Pagans of antiquity; and that on the&s;e they principally relied in the day of battle. In this &s;hort, but comprehen&s;ive &s;entence, therefore, Eli&s;ha not only recognizes in Elijah, the venerable, endear|ing, and provident qualities of a parent; but a&s;cribes to him all the influence and energy of a numerous ho&s;t; and bewails his exit as a misfortune, which reduced the kingdom to a weak and defencele&s;s condition!</P>
<P>PURSUANT to this interpretation of the text, I propo&s;e briefly to con&s;ider, I. The &s;ingular favour which Heaven be&s;tows on a people, by rai&s;ing up men of elevated genius and patrioti&s;m to take part in the conduct of public concerns: II. The deplora|ble calamity of being deprived of their abilities and labours, by death: and then, to improve the &s;ubject by pointing out the u&s;es to be made of &s;uch afflictive bereavements.</P>
<P>BY far the greater part of mankind, in every re|gion of the earth, however di&s;po&s;ed, are, in the na|ture of things, incapable of managing the affairs of &s;tate. Engro&s;&s;ed by the cares and pur&s;uits which per&s;onal de&s;ires and wants create, they have neither lei&s;ure nor inclination to prepare them&s;elves for &s;o important a tru&s;t. For this purpo&s;e, a concurrence of circum&s;tances and properties, which can fall to the &s;hare of but very few, are indi&s;pen&s;ably requi&s;ite. Be&s;ide undeviating rectitude of intention, a capacious under&s;tanding, much &s;tudy, accurate ob&s;ervation, ex|ten&s;ive knowledge, inflexible firmne&s;s, and great
<PB N="7" REF="037438_0004_100D42CE373583B0">
pre&s;ence of mind, are e&s;&s;ential characteri&s;tics of a good magi&s;trate, or leader. I need not remark, that per&s;ons of this de&s;cription are rarely to be found, and therefore proportionably e&s;timable.</P>
<P>WITH &s;uch men at the head of the different de|partments, a nation has little to fear, but from its own degeneracy. Like the &s;un in the firmament, they are the centre and &s;ource of light; and, while they regulate the motions of the &s;everal parts of the &s;y&s;tem, and confine the mo&s;t excentric to their proper &s;pheres, they &s;hed a benign and &s;alutary influence on the whole. Meanwhile, by their vigilant circum|&s;pection, they guard again&s;t the ho&s;tilities of foreign powers; and, in ca&s;e of actual annoyance or inva&s;ion, furni&s;h the be&s;t human means of indemnity and de|fence. Under their admini&s;tration, tumult and fac|tion di&s;appear, and every thing con&s;pires the promo|tion of order, peace, and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>HAPPY the land, who&s;e rulers are thus commi&s;&s;ion|ed and &s;ent, not to tyrannize and oppre&s;s; but "for the puni&s;hment of evil doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well:" and peculiar are the obliga|tions of its inhabitants to Him, "by whom kings reign and princes decree ju&s;tice," for his di&s;tingui&s;h|ing goodne&s;s!" "For promotion cometh neither from the ea&s;t, nor from the we&s;t, nor from the &s;outh. But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and &s;etteth up another."</P>
<P>THIS, my brethren, has hitherto been our favour|ed lot. Few nations can boa&s;t a more ample &s;upply
<PB N="8" REF="037438_0005_100D42D0DEC37918">
of illu&s;trious &s;tate&s;men and warriors than America. We have now at our head, a man who&s;e integrity and wi&s;dom demand our highe&s;t confidence and e&s;|teem; and we can recount many in the legi&s;lative and judiciary branches of our government, in the military line, and even in private life, who are ble&s;|&s;ings to their country, and ornaments to human na|ture!&mdash;Still, however, we cannot but deeply feel and lament the lo&s;s of one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t men, whom this, or any preceding century, has produced.</P>
<P>I PROCEED, then, II. To con&s;ider the deplorable calamity of being deprived of &s;uch characters, by death.</P>
<P>AMONG the &s;evere&s;t judgments which the prophets, of old, denounced again&s;t the Jews, were the follow|ing: "Behold the Lord, the Lord of ho&s;ts, doth take away from Judah, and Jeru&s;alem, the mighty man, the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient. And I will give children to be their princes, and babes &s;hall rule over them. And the people &s;hall be oppre&s;&s;ed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child &s;hall behave him&s;elf proudly again&s;t the ancient, and the ba&s;e again&s;t the honorable."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah iii. 2, 4 5.</NOTE> A more ju&s;t and &s;triking de&s;cription of that anarchy and confu|&s;ion, to which the want of able politicians and &s;kilful chiefs invariably expo&s;es a community, can hardly be conceived. Every people, in this &s;ituation, is more or le&s;s expo&s;ed to the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es. For although there may be others, capable of &s;ucceeding and doing

honor to the &s;tation of the decea&s;ed; yet it cannot be certain that the preference will be given to the mo&s;t de&s;erving &s;urvivor. It is po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t, that ignorance, party zeal, or &s;elf-opinionated ob&s;tinacy may ve&s;t with the authority tho&s;e who are totally unfit to govern: the con&s;equence of which would be, a change of mea&s;ures, fatal to the dignity and happine&s;s of the nation!&mdash;But imagination mu&s;t paint the long catalogue of evils which would inev|itably follow &s;uch a mi&s;taken deci&s;ion; for language is inadequate to the ta&s;k!</P>
<P>How great and portentous, then, is <HI>"our</HI> breach! Who can heal us?"</P>
<P>THE father, the friend, and the deliverer of his country &s;leeps in the &s;ilent tomb! And where is the man who will refu&s;e to pay a tribute of the &s;incere&s;t re&s;pect to his memory; or to contemplate, with un|di&s;&s;embled gratitude, his multifarious labours of love for the land in which we dwell?</P>
<P>HAVING previou&s;ly &s;ignalized him&s;elf, both by his courage and conduct, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE reader will &s;carcely need to be reminded, that the au|thor here alludes to the gallant behaviour of General [then Col.] WASHINGTON, at Braddock's defeat, in 1755, and to the many other valiant achievements of his youth; too many to be enume|rated in a &s;ingle di&s;cour&s;e.</NOTE> he was early invited to the &s;upreme command in the revolutionary war. During that long and arduous &s;truggle for liberty, he &s;ur|mounted the mo&s;t perplexing difficulties, outbraved the mo&s;t formidable oppo&s;ition, and, with a degree of per&s;everance and addre&s;s which a&s;toni&s;hed the

world, finally compelled one of the greate&s;t powers in Europe to acknowledge the independence and &s;overeignty of its colonies. Yet far from being ela|ted by his unexampled &s;ucce&s;s, or, like the haughty monarch of Babylon, a&s;cribing it to the might of his own arm, his language was uniformly the language of piety, gratitude, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and confidence to|wards God.</P>
<P>AT the conclu&s;ion of the war, the army, who had fought and bled in the American cau&s;e, had claims, to a large amount, upon the public; nor was it po&s;|&s;ible that the&s;e claims &s;hould be immediately &s;atisfied. Hence di&s;content and murmurs prevailed; and a re|fu&s;al to lay down their arms, till they were indem|nified, was even contemplated. In this &s;tate of things, had the commander in chief been actuated by tho&s;e ambitious views which have u&s;ually governed the conduct of heroes, both ancient and modern, how ea&s;ily might he have &s;ubjected to his own control, tho&s;e provinces, which he had been able to protect again&s;t foreign invaders! But he recoiled at the thought; and in&s;tead of availing him&s;elf of the un|limited a&s;cendency he had gained, to di&s;tre&s;s his country, no &s;ooner was the object, for which an army had been rai&s;ed, completed, than he per&s;uaded his troops peaceably to di&s;band, and wait with patience the reward of their toils; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"AFTER the return of peace, the United States were redu|ced to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing their brave troops, without paying them their &s;tipulated wages. In this emergency, an attempt was made, by &s;pirited and anonymous publications, to inflame the minds of the officers and &s;oldiers, and induce them, previou&s;ly to laying down their arms, to unite in redre&s;&s;ing their own grievances.</P><P>"As &s;oon as General WASHINGTON was informed of the na|ture of the&s;e papers, he reque&s;ted the general and field officers, with one officer from each company, and a proper repre&s;entation from the &s;taff of the army, to a&s;&s;emble on an early day. When they were convened, he addre&s;&s;ed them in a pathetic and animat|ed &s;peech, in which he pledged him&s;elf to exert all his abilities and influence in their favour; reque&s;ted them to rely on the faith of their country, and conjured them, "as they valued their honor; as they re&s;pected the rights of humanity; as they re|garded the military and national character of America, to expre&s;s their utmo&s;t dete&s;tation of the man, who was attempting to open the floodgates of civil di&s;cord, and deluge their ri&s;ing empire with blood."</P><P>"THE patriotic exertions of their beloved General &s;aved the &s;tates from impending danger.

to private life, and rejected every other compen&s;ation but the heartfelt plea&s;ure of having emancipated mil|lions from the yoke of bondage, and laid a founda|tion for the freedom and pro&s;perity of millions more, yet to be born!</P>
<P>HE did not, however, &s;o far &s;eclude him&s;elf from &s;ociety, as to become indifferent to its welfare; nor was his fondne&s;s for the calm enjoyments of his hap|py retreat, though great, &s;ufficient to prevent his hearing and obeying the call of his country, when her exigencies again demanded his attention and his talents. He readily &s;tepped forth, and with other long-tried patriots, formed that excellent con&s;titution, which is, at once, the pride and &s;ecurity of every

When this con&s;titution had received the &s;anction of the different &s;tates, and was to be brought into operation; and when all eyes were fixed upon him, as the fir&s;t pre&s;ident, and &s;u|preme executive of the Union, di&s;claiming the wi&s;h and expectation of reward, he a&s;&s;umed the reins of government, and exchanged the plea&s;ures of rural &s;olitude, for the anxious cares and arduous duties of the mo&s;t public and re&s;pon&s;ible office in the nation. When he had di&s;charged the functions of this office, during the terms for which he was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively cho|&s;en, with a degree of rectitude and di&s;cernment, no le&s;s honorable to him&s;elf, than advantageous to his con&s;tituents, he felt at liberty to revi&s;it the peaceful &s;hades of his retirement.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"HAVING been twice cho&s;en," &s;ays Gen.

<P>DESTINED to be nece&s;&s;ary and beneficial to the multitude of his brethren, even to the la&s;t, it was not long before he was again placed between them and impending danger.</P>

<P>THOUGH grown old in the &s;ervice of his country, and having a claim, on this account, to re&s;t and re|po&s;e, for the remainder of his days; yet the revered patriot, in the &s;tyle of his accu&s;tomed magnanimity, con&s;ented to fill the important, laborious, and haz|ardous &s;tation.

<P>I AM, now, to improve the &s;ubject by pointing out the proper u&s;es to be made of this afflictive be|reavement.</P>
<P>A CRISIS, when the abilities and exertions of emi|nent men were more nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of her &s;overeignty and peace, America has never &s;een. At this cri&s;is, therefore, to be deprived of <HI>one,</HI> who has been &s;o invariably, and &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly u&s;eful to us, is a manife&s;t token of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure at our &s;ins, and calls loudly upon us to lie low in the du&s;t before that God, from whom we have revolted. Let us, then, lay it &s;eriou&s;ly to heart, and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ively inquire, "wherefore it is that the Lord hath this controver&s;y with us?" A general reformation
<PB N="16" REF="037438_0013_100D42E24769CBF0">
is, certainly, de&s;irable, expedient, and nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash; Such a reformation, neverthele&s;s, cannot be effected, but by the amendment of individuals; for, of indi|viduals the community is compo&s;ed. Under this impre&s;&s;ion, let each one critically examine the pre|vailing tenor of his de&s;ires and pur&s;uits, and compare it with the rule of his duty, in relation both to God and man. However contracted the &s;phere, in which we move, it is in our power, either to counteract, or to advance the commonweal. Indeed, one or the other of the&s;e mu&s;t be the perpetual re&s;ult of all our actions. Taught, therefore, both by rea&s;on and &s;cripture, that "as righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation, &s;o &s;in is the reproach of any people," let us &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and "ab&s;tain from the very ap|pearance of evil." Fir&s;t of all, let us cultivate the profounde&s;t reverence for the authority of Jehovah; and under the influence of this corrective and com|manding principle, let us pay a con&s;tant and con&s;ci|entious attention to all the intimations of his will. Not content with mere preten&s;ions to piety, moral|ity, or patrioti&s;m, let us inve&s;tigate the nature and extent of the&s;e obligations, and from chri&s;tian mo|tives, di&s;play a cheerful and unre&s;erved conformity to them, in the whole &s;eries of our deportment.</P>
<P>I KNOW it has been alleged by &s;ome infidel writers, that the go&s;pel no where enjoins the love of our country. But this allegation I conceive to be un|founded. Does not every page of the New-Te&s;ta|ment implicitly inculcate this duty? And does not
<PB N="17" REF="037438_0014_100D42E3D38F9D38">
the uniform cour&s;e of our Saviour's life intelligibly and powerfully recommend it? Who ever prayed more earne&s;tly for the welfare, or wept more &s;incere|ly at the misfortunes of his country, than he? Did he di&s;cover no appropriate attachment to it, when he made its inhabitants the fir&s;t offers of his religion; and when, in defiance of the mo&s;t cruel per&s;ecutions, and with the certain pro&s;pect of the mo&s;t ignomin|ious death, he per&s;i&s;ted in his endeavours to promote their virtue and felicity?</P>
<P>SHALL we, then, extol tho&s;e pagan worthies, who, though exiled from their native clime, continued in|flexible, notwith&s;tanding, in their regard to its inter|e&s;t, and unwearied in their endeavours to increa&s;e its honor? Shall we repre&s;ent them, as in&s;tructing all &s;ucceeding ages in the noble principles and offices of patrioti&s;m? And &s;hall we, in the mean time, refu&s;e an equal, nay, a far &s;uperior degree of the &s;ame honor to Je&s;us of Nazareth? No, my brethren, for Je&s;us of Nazareth was a perfect pattern of this, as well as of every other excellence. This, therefore, is incumbent upon us, not only as citizens, but as Chri&s;tians. We are e&s;pecially urged to it by the critical &s;ituation, into which we are thrown by the lo&s;s we now deplore. Bereft of the coun&s;el and guidance of him, who has been &s;o long and &s;o exten|&s;ively viewed as our &s;afeguard and defence, will not tho&s;e, who &s;eek our hurt, be emboldened to redouble their arts and intrigues, to facilitate and ha&s;ten our ruin? And are we not furni&s;hed, by this apprehen|&s;ion,
<PB N="18" REF="037438_0015_100D42E65120D3A0">
with the &s;tronge&s;t arguments for union, firm|ne&s;s, and public &s;pirit among our&s;elves?</P>
<P>HAPPY for us, while the departure of our beloved Chief admoni&s;hes us of the <HI>importance,</HI> his example clearly teaches us the <HI>nature</HI> of the patriotic affec|tions: thrice happy, if we be di&s;po&s;ed to walk in his &s;teps! The &s;y&s;tem of his politics was pacific, and yet dignified and con&s;i&s;tent. Per&s;everance in &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, alike independent of every foreign power, and of all foreign interference, is manife&s;tly requi&s;ite to &s;ave us from national degradation. Nor let any imagine, becau&s;e he is incapable of contributing, like him, to its adoption and prevalence, that, therefore, he has nothing to do in &s;o good a cau&s;e. Every man has his influence in &s;ociety; and every man is bound to exert it, not by &s;owing the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;ention and jealou&s;y; not by indulging party feelings and de|&s;igns; not by ob&s;tructing the mea&s;ures of govern|ment, or calumniating the characters of tho&s;e who admini&s;ter it. The&s;e are the ebullitions of di&s;ap|pointed ambition, which gra&s;ps at every place of honor and emolument, and would &s;acrifice an empire at the &s;hrine of pride and avarice! Such were nei|ther the temper, nor the practice of WASHINGTON. He was not eager for promotion; and when it was forced upon him by the united voice of the people, he was apparently induced to accept it, not &s;o much by the impul&s;e of inclination, as by the dictates of con&s;cience. He was willing to &s;erve his country in any &s;tation, to which &s;he called him; and to his im|mortal

honor be it remembered, the rank which he held at his death, was a voluntary de&s;cent from his former exaltation! It is equally incumbent upon us all, to aim rather at u&s;efulne&s;s, than di&s;tinction; and, &s;atisfied with the po&s;t which nature and the public have a&s;&s;igned us, to di&s;charge, with fidelity, the va|rious duties it impo&s;es; and contribute, though it be but a &s;ingle mite, to the harmony, order, and &s;ta|bility of the great whole. To this end, we are vi&s;i|bly obliged, without conferring with &s;elf, or &s;elfi&s;h men, to make the general good the rule of our de|ci&s;ions and actions. Deaf to the importunities of clamorous &s;eekers, (for &s;uch are of all mankind the mo&s;t unqualified to rule), we &s;hould countenance none, either by our conver&s;ation, or our &s;uffrages, but tho&s;e whom we believe, in our hearts, both ca|pable and de&s;irous of rendering &s;ervice to the nation.</P>
<P>WHEN, by the&s;e means, we have done our utmo&s;t to place integrity and talents in the admini&s;tration, it is no le&s;s our duty to "&s;trengthen the hands, and encourage the hearts" of our rulers, not only by a per&s;onal &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the laws; but by inducing others, as far as in us lies, to "lead quiet and peace|able lives in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty."</P>
<P>COULD the&s;e pure intentions, and this laudable conduct, univer&s;ally prevail, peace at home, and re|&s;pectability abroad, would be our favoured lot! We might &s;et every adver&s;ary at defiance, and tru&s;t in God, that, as tho&s;e illu&s;trious names, who have hith|erto been our &s;hield and protection, are numbered
<PB N="20" REF="037438_0017_100D42EA9C83DDA0">
with the dead, others will be rai&s;ed up in their &s;tead, to defend our rights, and perpetuate our pro&s;perity!</P>
<P>ANOTHER thought, which the &s;ubject and occa|&s;ion jointly &s;ugge&s;t, while it additionally enforces the preceding obligation, particularly invites us to "lay up in &s;tore for our&s;elves, a good foundation again&s;t the time to come."</P>
<P>HAD wealth, had fame, had friends been &s;ufficient to "redeem from death," WASHINGTON had not died! But "there is no di&s;charge in that war!" High and low, learned and ignorant, free and bond, mu&s;t "lie down alike in the du&s;t: for the &s;mall and the great are there!" Such being "the end of all the living," how vain and in&s;ignificant, in compari|&s;on, are the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and acqui&s;itions of time; and how infinitely important is a &s;ea&s;onable preparation for eternity! "Let not the wi&s;e man, then, glory in his wi&s;dom; neither let the mighty man glory in his might; let not the rich man glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he un|der&s;tandeth and knoweth the Lord!"</P>
<P>OUR chief emulation &s;hould be, to "obtain an in|heritance among all them that are &s;anctified;" and &s;ince "we have no continuing city here, to &s;eek one to come. For the world pa&s;&s;eth away, and the lu&s;t thereof; but he that doeth the will of God, abideth forever." Soon &s;hall the fierce contentions of king|doms and &s;tates, and the bu&s;tling rivalries of indi|viduals, be &s;uper&s;eded by the more awful war of elements, and conflagration of matter! But &s;ooner
<PB N="21" REF="037438_0018_100D42EC9AC90A58">
&s;till &s;hall a final period be put to all <HI>our</HI> &s;ublunary cares and pur&s;uits! The king of terrors is not far from every one of us! "In &s;uch an hour as we think not," we may be &s;ummoned into the invi&s;ible &s;tate, and called to a &s;trict and &s;olemn account for "the deeds done in the body!"</P>
<P>"SEEING then we look for &s;uch things," and are appri&s;ed of their &s;peedy and certain approach, by the dictates of rea&s;on, the declarations of &s;cripture, and the awakening admonitions of providence, "what manner of per&s;ons ought we to be, in all holy con|ver&s;ation and godline&s;s!" Can we cheri&s;h anticipa|tions of this kind, and yet pre&s;ume unduly to covet the plea&s;ures, the profits, or the honors of this lower creation? Can we con&s;ent, for the &s;ake of the&s;e mo|mentary and peri&s;hable attainments, to forfeit the complacency and approbation of Heaven, or to in|jure the community to which we belong? Let us rather re&s;olve, never to gain the lea&s;t gratification, or to receive any degree of applau&s;e, but as the re|ward of laudable de&s;igns and exertions; de&s;igns and exertions, at once, acceptable to God, and &s;ervice|able to man.</P>
<P>IF, in this way, we ri&s;e into public e&s;timation, let us improve our increa&s;ed influence in the cau&s;e of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. But if, after all, it be our fate to remain in the humbler walks of life, let us not repine at the divine ordination; but exerci&s;e a pious re&s;ignation and obedience to the will of our Maker, and &s;trive, even in the narrow circle by which we
<PB N="22" REF="037438_0019_100D42EEC835F590">
are circum&s;cribed, to mitigate the ills, and enhance the enjoyments of humanity.&mdash;In any event, whether in affluence, or in poverty; whether "in good report, or in evil report," let us "&s;erve God and our generation" faithfully; hold our&s;elves in habitual readine&s;s for our la&s;t change, and "give all diligence to make our calling and election &s;ure. If we do the&s;e things, we &s;hall never fall: for &s;o an entrance &s;hall be mini&s;tered to us abundantly, into the everla&s;ting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t."</P>
