<HEAD>PREFACE, BY A LADY.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Written in 1724.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS going, like common editors, to adverti&s;e the reader of the beauties and excellencies of the work laid before him: To tell him that the illu&s;trious author had oportunities, that other travellers, whatever their quality or curio&s;ity may have been, cannot obtain; and a genius capable of making the be&s;t improve|ment of every opportunity. But if the reader, after peru&s;ing <HI>one</HI> letter only, has not di&s;cernment to di&s;tingui&s;h that na|tural elegance, that delicacy of &s;entiment and ob&s;ervation, that ea&s;y gracefulne&s;s, and lovely &s;implicity (which is the per|fection of writing) and in which the&s;e <HI>Letters</HI> exceed all that have appeared in

this kind, or almo&s;t in any other, let him lay the book down, and leave it to tho&s;e who have.</P>
<P>The noble author had the goodne&s;s to lend me her M. S. to &s;atisfy my curio|&s;ity in &s;ome enquiries I had made con|cerning her travels; and when I had it in my hands, how was it po&s;&s;ible to part with it? I once had the vanity to hope I might acquaint the public, that it owed this invaluable trea&s;ure to my importunities. But alas! the mo&s;t inge|nious author has condemned it to ob|&s;curity during her life; and conviction, as well as deference, obliges me to yield to her rea&s;ons. However, if the&s;e <HI>Letters</HI> appear hereafter when I am in my grave, let this attend them, in te&s;|timony to po&s;terity, that among her cotemporaries, <HI>one</HI> woman, at lea&s;t, was ju&s;t to her merit.</P>
<P>There is not any thing &s;o excellent, but &s;ome will carp at it, and the rather, becau&s;e of its excellency. But to &s;uch hypercritics, I &s;hall only &s;ay * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *.</P>

whil&s;t it is &s;urfeited with <HI>Male-Travels,</HI> all in the &s;ame tone, and &s;tuft with the &s;ame trifles; a lady has the &s;kill to &s;trike out a new path, and to embelli&s;h a worn|out &s;ubject, with variety of fre&s;h and ele|gant entertainment. For be&s;ides the vi|vacity and &s;pirit which enlivens every part, and that inimitable beauty which &s;preads through the whole; be&s;ides the purity of the &s;tyle, for which it may be ju&s;tly accounted the &s;tandard of the En|gli&s;h tongue; the reader will find a more true and accurate account of the cu&s;toms and manners of the &s;everal na|tions, with whom this lady conver&s;ed, than he can in any other author. But as her lady&s;hip's penetration di&s;covers the inmo&s;t follies of the heart, &s;o the can|dour of her temper pa&s;&s;ed over them with an air of pity rather than reproach; treating with the politene&s;s of a court, and the gentlene&s;s of a lady, what the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">verity of her judgment could not but condemn.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT OF THE EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE editor of the&s;e Letters, who during his re&s;idence at Venice, was honoured with the e&s;teem and friend&s;hip of their ingenious and ele|gant author, pre&s;ents them to the pub|lic, for the two following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e it was the manife&s;t in|tention of the Lady M&mdash;y W&mdash;y M&mdash;e, that this SELECT COLLECTION of her Letters &s;hould be communicated to the public: an intention declared, not only to the Editor, but to a few more cho&s;en friends, to whom &s;he gave co|pies of the&s;e incomparable Letters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second</HI> and principal rea&s;on that has engaged the Editor to let this col|lection &s;ee the light, is, that the publi|cation of the&s;e letters will be an immor|tal monument to the memory of Lady M&mdash;y W&mdash;y; and will &s;hew, as long as the Engli&s;h language endures,
<PB REF="041644_0009_101AD173E0D53E30">
the &s;prightline&s;s of her wit, the &s;oli|dity of her judgment, the extent of her knowledge, the eligance of her ta&s;te, and the excellence of her <HI>real</HI> character.</P>
<P>The SELECT COLLECTION, here pub|li&s;hed, was faithfully tran&s;cribed from the original manu&s;cript of her lady&s;hip at Venice.</P>
<P>The Letters from <HI>Ratisbon, Vienna, Dre&s;|den, Peterwaradin, Belgrade, Adrianople, Con|&s;tantinople, Pera, Tunis, Genoa, Lions,</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> are, certainly, the mo&s;t curious and intere&s;ting part of this publication; and both in point of <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>form,</HI> are, to &s;ay no more of them, &s;ingularly worthy of the curio&s;ity and attention of all <HI>men of ta&s;te,</HI> and even of all <HI>women of fa&s;hion.</HI> As to tho&s;e female readers, who read for improvement, and think their beauty an in&s;ipid thing if it is not &s;ea&s;oned by in|tellectual charms, they will find in the&s;e Letters what they &s;eek for, and will be|hold in their author, an ornament and model to their &s;ex.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Rotterdam,</HI> <DATE>Aug. 3, O. S. 1716.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I FLATTER my&s;elf (dear &s;i&s;ter) that I &s;hall give you &s;ome plea&s;ure in letting you know that I have &s;afely pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ea, though we had the ill fortune of a &s;torm. We were per&s;uaded by the captain of the yatcht to &s;et out in a calm, and he pretended there was nothing &s;o ea&s;y as to tide it over; but, after two days &s;lowly moving, the wind blew &s;o hard, that none of the &s;ailors could keep their feet, and we were all Sun|day night to&s;&s;ed very hand&s;omely. I never &s;aw a man more frighted than the captain. For my part, I have been &s;o lucky, neither to &s;uffer from fear nor &s;ea-&s;ick|ne&s;s; tho', I confe&s;s, I was &s;o impatient to &s;ee my&s;elf once more upon dry land, that I would not &s;tay till the yatcht could get to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> but went in a long-boat to <HI>Helvoet&s;luys,</HI> where we had voitures to carry us to <HI>Briel.</HI> I was charmed with the neatne&s;s of that little town; but my arrival at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> pre&s;ented me a new &s;cene of plea&s;ure. All the &s;treets are paved with broad &s;tones, and before many of the meane&s;t artificers doors are placed &s;eats of various coloured marbles, &s;o neatly kept, that I a&s;&s;ure you, I walked almo&s;t all over the town ye&s;terday, <HI>incognito,</HI> in my &s;lippers, without receiving one &s;pot of dirt: and you may &s;ee the Dutch maids wa&s;hing the pavement of the &s;treet, with more application than ours do our bed-chambers. The town &s;eems &s;o full of people, with &s;uch bu&s;y faces, all in
<PB N="2" REF="041644_0011_101AD1778D8D40E8">
motion, that I can hardly fancy it is not &s;ome celebrated fair; but I &s;ee it is every day the &s;ame. 'Tis certain no town can be more advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated for com|merce. Here are &s;even large canals, on which the merchants &s;hips come up to the very doors of their hou&s;es. The &s;hops and warehou&s;es are of a &s;urprizing neatne&s;s and magnificence, filled with an incredible quan|tity of fine merchandize, and &s;o much cheaper than what we &s;ee in England, that I have much ado to per|&s;uade my&s;elf I am &s;till &s;o near it. Here is neither dirt nor beggary to be &s;een. One is not &s;hocked with tho&s;e loath&s;ome cripples, &s;o common in London, nor teized with the importunity of idle fellows and wenches, that choo&s;e to be na&s;ty and lazy. The common &s;ervants and little &s;hop-women, here, are more nicely clean, than mo&s;t of our ladies, and the great variety of neat dre&s;&s;es (every woman dre&s;&s;ing her head after her own fa&s;hion) is an additional plea&s;ure in &s;eeing the town. You &s;ee, hitherto, I make no complaints, dear &s;i&s;ter, and, if I continue to like travelling as well as I do at pre&s;ent, I &s;hall not repent my project. It will go a great way in making me &s;atisfied with it, if it affords me an opportu|nity of entertaining you. But it is not from Holland, that you mu&s;t expect a <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> offer. I can write enough in the &s;tile of Rotterdam, to tell you plainly, in one word, that I expect returns of all the London news. You &s;ee I have already learnt to make a good bargain, and that it is not for nothing I will &s;o much as tell you, I am, Your affectionate &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Hague,</HI> <DATE>Aug. 5, O. S. 1716,</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I MAKE ha&s;te to tell you, dear Madam, that after all the dreadful fatigues you threatened me with, I am hitherto very well plea&s;ed with my journey. We take care to make &s;uch &s;hort &s;tages every day, that I rather fancy my&s;elf upon parties of plea&s;ure, than upon the road, and &s;ure nothing can be more agreeable than travelling in Holland. The whole country appears a large garden; the roads are well paved, &s;haded on each &s;ide with rows of trees, and boarded with large canals, full of boats, pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing. Every twenty paces gives you the pro&s;pect of &s;ome villa, and every four hours, that of a large town, &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly neat, I am &s;ure you would be charmed with them. The place I am now at, is certainly one of the fine&s;t villages in the world. Here are &s;everal &s;quares finely built, and, (what I think a particular beauty) the whole &s;et with thick large trees. The <HI>Voor-hout</HI> is, at the &s;ame time, the Hide Park and Mall of the people of quality; for they take the air in it both on foot and in coaches. There are &s;hops for wafers, cool liquors, &amp;c. I have been to &s;ee &s;everal of the mo&s;t celebrated gardens, but I will not teize you with their de&s;criptions. I dare &s;wear you think my letter already long enough. But I mu&s;t not conclude without begging your pardon, for not obeying your commands, in &s;ending the lace you ordered me. Upon my word I can yet find none, that is not dearer than you may buy in London. If you want any India goods, here are great variety of penny|worths, and I &s;hall follow your orders with great plea|&s;ure and exactne&s;s, being, Dear Madam, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Nimeguen,</HI> <DATE>Aug. 13, O. S. 1716.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM extremely &s;orry, my dear S. that your fears of di&s;obliging your relations, and their fears for your health and &s;afety, have hindered me from enjoy|ing the happine&s;s of your company, and you the plea|&s;ure of a diverting journey. I receive &s;ome degree of mortification from every agreeable novelty, or plea&s;ing pro&s;pect, by the reflection of your having &s;o unluckily mi&s;&s;ed the delight which I know it would have given you. If you were with me in this town, you would be ready to expect to receive vi&s;its from your <HI>Nottingham</HI> friends. No two places were ever more re&s;embling; one has but to give the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> the name of the <HI>Trent,</HI> and there is no di&s;tingui&s;hing the pro&s;pect. The hou&s;es, like tho&s;e of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> are built one above another, and are intermixed, in the &s;ame manner, with trees and gardens. The Tower, they call <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar'</HI>s, has the &s;ame &s;ituation with <HI>Nottingham</HI> Ca&s;tle; and I can|not help fancying I &s;ee from it, the <HI>Trent-field, Adboul|ton,</HI> places &s;o well known to us. 'Tis true, the for|tifications make a con&s;iderable difference. All the learned in the art of war, be&s;tow great commendations on them; for my part, that know nothing of the mat|ter, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with telling you, 'tis a very pretty walk on the ramparts, on which there is a tower, very de&s;ervedly called the <HI>Belvidera,</HI> where people go to drink coffee, tea, &amp;c. and enjoy one of the fine&s;t pro&s;pects in the world. The public walks have no great beauty, but the thick &s;hade of the trees, which is &s;olemnly delightful. But I mu&s;t not forget to take
<PB N="5" REF="041644_0014_101AD17E4FA474A0">
notice of the bridge, which appeared very &s;urpri&s;ing to me. It is large enough to hold hundreds of men, with hor&s;es and carriages. They give the value of an En|gli&s;h two-pence to get upon it, and then away they go, bridge and all, to the other &s;ide of the river, with &s;o slow a motion, one is hardly &s;en&s;ible of any at all. I was ye&s;terday at the French church, and &s;tared very much at the manner of &s;ervice. The par&s;on clapped on a broad-brimed hat in the fir&s;t place, which gave him entirely the air of, <HI>what d'ye call him,</HI> in Bartholomew fair, which he kept up by extraordinary antic ge&s;tures, and preaching much &s;uch &s;tuff, as t'other talked to the puppets. However the congregation &s;eemed to receive it with great devotion; and I was informed, by &s;ome of his flock, that he is a per&s;on of particular fame among&s;t them. I believe by this time, you are as much tired with my account of him, as I was with his &s;er|mon; but I am &s;ure your brother will excu&s;e a digre&s;|&s;ion in favour of the church of England. You know, &s;peaking di&s;re&s;pectfully of the Calvini&s;ts, is the &s;ame thing as &s;peaking honourably of the church. Adieu, my dear S. always remember me, and be a&s;&s;ured, I can never forget you, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>IF my lady&mdash;could have any notion of the fatigues that I have &s;uffered the&s;e two la&s;t days, I am &s;ure &s;he would own it a great proof of regard, that I now &s;it down to write to her. We hired hor&s;es from Nimeguen hither, not having the conveniency of the
<PB N="6" REF="041644_0015_101AD1809D051B90">
po&s;t, and found but very indifferent accommodations at Reinberg, our fir&s;t &s;tage; but it was nothing to what I &s;uffered ye&s;terday. We were in hopes to reach Co|logn; our hor&s;es tired at Stamel, three hours from it, where I was forced to pa&s;s the night in my clothes, in a room, not at all better than an hovel; for though I have my bed with me, I had no mind to undre&s;s, where the wind came from a thou&s;and places. We left this wretched lodging at day break, and about &s;ix, this morning, came &s;afe here, where I got immediately into bed. I &s;lept &s;o well for three hours, that I found my|&s;elf perfectly recovered, and have had &s;pirits enough to go and &s;ee all that is curious in the town, that is to &s;ay, the churches, for here is nothing el&s;e worth &s;eeing. This is a very large town, but the mo&s;t part of it is old built. The Je&s;uits church, which is the neate&s;t, was &s;hewed me, in a very complai&s;ant manner, by a hand|&s;ome young Je&s;uit; who, not knowing who I was, took a liberty in his compliments and ralleries, which very much diverted me. Having never before &s;een any thing of that nature, I could not enough admire the magnificence of the altars, the rich images of the &s;aints (all ma&s;&s;y &s;ilver) and the <HI>encha&s;ures</HI> of the relicks, though I could not help murmuring in my heart, at the profu&s;ion of pearls, diamonds, and rubies, be&s;towed on the adornment of rotten teeth and dirty rags. I own that I had wickedne&s;s enough to covet <HI>St. Ur&s;ula'</HI>s pearl necklace; though perhaps this was no wickedne&s;s at all, an image not being certainly one's neighbour; but I went yet farther, and wi&s;hed the wench her&s;elf con|verted into dre&s;&s;ing plate. I &s;hould al&s;o gladly &s;ee converted into &s;ilver, a great <HI>St. Chri&s;topher,</HI> which I imagine would look very well in a ci&s;tern. The&s;e were my pious reflections; though I was very well &s;atisfied to &s;ee, piled up to the honour of our nation, the &s;kulls
<PB N="7" REF="041644_0016_101AD182D0E3F980">
of the Eleven Thou&s;and Virgins. I have &s;een &s;ome hundreds of relicks here of no le&s;s con&s;equence; but I will not imitate the common &s;tile of travellers &s;o far, as to give you a li&s;t of them; being per&s;uaded, that you have no manner of curio&s;ity for the titles given to jaw bones and bits of worm-eaten wood.&mdash;Adieu, I am ju&s;t going to &s;upper, where I &s;hall drink your health in an admirable &s;ort of Lorrain wine, which I am &s;ure is the &s;ame you call Burgundy in London, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>AFTER five days travelling po&s;t, I could not &s;it down to write on any other occa&s;ion than to tell my dear Lady, that I have not forgot her obliging command of &s;ending her &s;ome account of my travels. I have already pa&s;&s;ed a large part of Germany, have &s;een all that is remarkable in Cologn, Frankfort, Wurt&s;|burg, and this place. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible not to ob&s;erve the difference between the free towns, and tho&s;e under the government of ab&s;olute princes, as all the little &s;o|vereigns of Germany are. In the fir&s;t there appears an air of commerce and plenty. The &s;treets are well built and full of people, neatly and plainly dre&s;&s;ed. The &s;hops are loaded with merchandize, and the commonalty are clean and cheerful. In the other you &s;ee a &s;ort of &s;habby finery, a number of dirty people of quality taw|dered out; narrow na&s;ty &s;treets out of repair, wretchedly thin of inhabitants, and above half of the common &s;ort a&s;king alms. I cannot help fancying one, under the figure of a clean Dutch citizen's wife, and the other

like a poor town lady of plea&s;ure, painted, and rib|boned out in her head-dre&s;s, with tarni&s;hed &s;ilver-laced &s;hoes, a ragged under-petticoat, a mi&s;erable mixture of vice, and poverty.&mdash;They have &s;umptuary laws in this town, which di&s;tingui&s;h their rank by their dre&s;s, pre|vent the exce&s;s which ruins &s;o many other cities, and has a more agreeable effect to the eye of a &s;tranger, than our fa&s;hions. I need not be a&s;hamed to own, that I wi&s;h the&s;e laws were in force in other parts of the world. When one con&s;iders impartially, the merit of a rich &s;uit of clothes in mo&s;t places, the re&s;pect and the &s;miles of favour it procures, not to &s;peak of the envy and &s;ighs it occa&s;ions (which is very often the principal charm to the wearer) one is forced to confe&s;s, that there is need of an uncommon under&s;tanding, to re&s;i&s;t the temptation of plea&s;ing friends and mortifying rivals; and that it is na|tural to young people to fall into a folly, which betrays them to that want of money, which is the &s;ource of a thou&s;and ba&s;ene&s;&s;es. What numbers of men have be|gun the world with generous inclinations, that have afterwards been the in&s;truments of bringing mi&s;ery on a whole people, being led by a vain expence into debts that they could clear no other way, but by the forfeit of their honour, and which they never could have contracted, if the re&s;pect the multitude pays to habits, was fixed by law, only to a particular colour or cut of plain cloth. The&s;e reflections draw after them others that are too melancholy. I will make ha&s;te to put them out of your head by the farce of relicks, with which I have been entertained in all Romi&s;h churches.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lutherans</HI> are not quite free from the&s;e fol|lies. I have &s;een here, in the principal church, a large piece of the Cro&s;s &s;et in jewels, and the point of the &s;pear, which, they told me, very gravely, was the &s;ame that pierced the &s;ide of our Saviour. But I was
<PB N="9" REF="041644_0018_101AD1871B413BE0">
particularly diverted in a little Roman catholic church which is permitted here, where the profe&s;&s;ors of that religion are not very rich, and con&s;equently cannot adorn their images in &s;o rich a manner as their neigh|bours. For not to be quite de&s;titute of all finery, they have dre&s;&s;ed up an image of our Saviour over the altar, in a fair full-bottomed wig, very well powdered. I imagine I &s;ee your lady&s;hip &s;tare at this article, of which you very much doubt the veracity; but upon my word, I have not yet made u&s;e of the privilege of a traveller, and my whole account is written with the &s;ame plain &s;incerity of heart, with which I a&s;&s;ure you that I am, dear Madam, your &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>I HAD the plea&s;ure of receiving yours, but the day before I left London. I give you a thou&s;and thanks for your good wi&s;hes, and have &s;uch an opinion of their efficacy, that, I am per&s;uaded, I owe, in part, to them the good luck of having proceeded &s;o far on my long journey without any ill accident. For I don't reckon it any, to have been &s;topped, a few days, in this town by a cold, &s;ince it has not only given me an opportunity of &s;eeing all that is curious in it, but of making &s;ome ac|quaintance with the ladies, who have all been to &s;ee me with great civility, particularly <HI>Madame</HI>&mdash;, the wife of our King's envoy from Hanover. She has car|ried me to all the a&s;&s;emblies, and I have been magni|ficently entertained at her hou&s;e, which is one of the fine&s;t here. You know that all the nobility of this
<PB N="10" REF="041644_0019_101AD189429F5B30">
place are Envoys from different States. Here are a great number of them, and they might pa&s;s their time agreeably enough, if they were le&s;s delicate on the point of ceremony. But in&s;tead of joining in the de|&s;ign of making the town as plea&s;ant to one another as they can, and improving their little &s;ocieties, they amu&s;e them&s;elves no other way, than with perpetual quarrels, which they take care to eternize, by leaving them to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; and an envoy to Ratisbon re|ceives, regularly, half a dozen quarrels, among the perqui&s;ites of his employment. You may be &s;ure the ladies are not wanting, on their &s;ide, in cheri&s;hing and improving the&s;e important <HI>piques,</HI> which divide the town almo&s;t into as many parties, as there are families. They choo&s;e rather to &s;uffer the mortification of &s;itting almo&s;t alone on their a&s;&s;embly nights, than to recede one jot from their preten&s;ions. I have not been here above a week, and yet I have heard from almo&s;t every one of them, the whole hi&s;tory of their wrongs, and dreadful complaints of the inju&s;tice of their neighbours, in hopes to draw me to their party. But I think it very prudent to remain neuter, though if I was to &s;tay among&s;t them, there would be no po&s;&s;ibility of continuing &s;o, their quarrels running &s;o high, that they will not be civil to tho&s;e that vi&s;it their adver&s;aries. The foundation of the&s;e everla&s;ting di&s;putes, turns entirely upon rank, place, and the title of Excellency, which they all pre|tend to, and what is very hard, will give it to no body. For my part I could not forbear advi&s;ing them (for the public good) to give the title of Excellency to every body, which would include the receiving it from every body; but the very mention of &s;uch a di&s;honourable peace, was received with as much indignation, as Mrs. <HI>Blackaire</HI> did the motion of a reference. And indeed, I began to think my&s;elf ill-natured, to offer to take from
<PB N="11" REF="041644_0020_101AD18B65A469E0">
them, in a town where there are &s;o few diver&s;ions, &s;o entertaining an amu&s;ement. I know that my peaceable di&s;po&s;ition already gives me a very ill figure, and that 'tis <HI>publicly</HI> whi&s;pered as a piece of impertinent pride in me, that I have hitherto been fancily civil to every body, as if I thought no body good enough to quarrel with. I &s;hould be obliged to change my behaviour, if I did not intend to pur&s;ue my journey in a few days. I have been to &s;ee the churches here, and had the permi&s;&s;ion of touching the relics, which was never &s;uffered in places where I was not known. I had, by this privi|lege, the opportunity of making an ob&s;ervation, which I doubt not might have been made in all the other churches, that the emeralds and rubies which they &s;how round their relics and images, are mo&s;t of them fal&s;e; though they tell you that many of the <HI>Cro&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Ma|donas,</HI> &s;et round with the&s;e &s;tones, have been the gifts of Emperors and other great Princes. I don't doubt indeed but they were at fir&s;t jewels of value; but the good fathers have found it convenient to apply them to other u&s;es, and the people are ju&s;t as well &s;atisfied with bits of gla&s;s. Among&s;t the&s;e relics, they &s;hewed me a prodigious claw &s;et in cold, which they called the claw of a Griffin, and I could not forbear a&s;king the Reve|rend Prie&s;t that &s;hewed it, whether the Griffin was a Saint? The que&s;tion almo&s;t put him be&s;ide his gravity; but he an&s;wered, they only kept it as a curio&s;ity. I was very much &s;candalized at a large &s;ilver image of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> where the <HI>Father</HI> is repre&s;ented under the figure of a decrepit old man, with a beard down to his knees, and triple crown on his head, holding in his arms. the Son, fixed on the Cro&s;s, and the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> in the &s;hape of a dove hovering over him.

<P>I AM now, my dear &s;i&s;ter, &s;afely arrived at Vienna, and I thank God, have not at all &s;uffered in my health, nor (what is dearer to me) in that of my child, by all our fatigues. We travelled by water from Rati&s;|bon, a journey perfectly agreeable, down the Danube, in one of tho&s;e little ve&s;&s;els, that they, very properly, call wooden hou&s;es, having in them all the convenien|cies of a palace, &s;toves in the chambers, kitchens, &amp;c. they are rowed by twelve men each, and move with &s;uch an incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, that in the &s;ame day you have the plea&s;ure of a va&s;t variety of pro&s;pects, and within the &s;pace of a few hours you have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing a populous city, adorned with magnificent palaces, and the mo&s;t romantic &s;olitudes, which appear di&s;tant from the commerce of mankind, the banks of the Danube being charmingly diver&s;ified with woods, rocks, mountains covered with vines, fields of corn, large cities and ruins of antient ca&s;tles. I &s;aw the great towns of Pa&s;&s;au and Lintz, famous for the retreat of the Impe|rial Court, when Vienna was be&s;ieged. This town, which has the honour of being the Emperor's re&s;idence, did not at all an&s;wer my expectation, nor ideas of it, being much le&s;s than I expected to find it; the &s;treets are very clo&s;e, and &s;o narrow, one cannot ob&s;erve the fine fronts of the palaces, though many of them very well de&s;erve ob&s;ervation, being truly magnificent. They are all built of fine white &s;tone, and are exce&s;&s;ive high. For as the town is too little for the number of the peo|ple that de&s;ire to live in it, the builders &s;eem to have projected to repair that mi&s;fortune, by clapping
<PB N="13" REF="041644_0022_101AD18FB6EE9770">
one town on the top of another, mo&s;t of the hou&s;es being of five, and &s;ome of them of &s;ix &s;tories. You may ea&s;ily imagine that, the &s;treets being &s;o narrow, the rooms are extremely dark, and what is an inconve|niency much more intolerable in my opinion, there is no hou&s;e has &s;o few as five or &s;ix familes in it. The apartments of the greate&s;t ladies, and even of the mi|ni&s;ters of &s;tate, are divided, but by a partition, from that of a taylor or &s;hoe-maker, and I know no body that has above two floors in any hou&s;e, one for their own u&s;e, and one higher for their &s;ervants. Tho&s;e that have hou&s;es of their own, let out the re&s;t of them, to whoever will take them, and thus the great &s;tairs (which are all of &s;tone) are as common and as dirty as the &s;treet. 'Tis true, when you have once travelled through them, nothing can be more &s;urpri&s;ingly magnificent than the apartments. They are commonly a <HI>&s;uite</HI> of eight or ten large rooms, all inlaid, the doors and win|dows richly carved and gilt, and the furniture &s;uch as is &s;eldom &s;een in the palaces of foreign princes in other countries. Their apartments are adorned with hang|ings of the fine&s;t tape&s;try of Bru&s;&s;els, prodigious large looking-gla&s;&s;es in &s;ilver frames, fine japan tables, beds, chairs, canopies and window curtains of the riche&s;t Genoa dama&s;k or velvet, almo&s;t covered with gold lace or embroidery. All this is made gay by pictures and va&s;t jars of japan china, and large lu&s;tres of rock cry&s;tal. I have already had the honour of being invited to dinner by &s;everal of the fir&s;t people of quality, and I mu&s;t do them the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, the good ta&s;te and magnificence of their tables very well an&s;wer to that of their furniture. I have been more than once entertained with fifty di&s;hes of meat, all &s;erved in &s;ilver, and well dre&s;&s;ed; the de&s;&s;ert proportionable, &s;erved in the fine&s;t china. But the variety and richne&s;s of their wines, is
<PB N="14" REF="041644_0023_101AD191DFFF0E28">
what appears the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing. The con&s;tant way is, to lay a li&s;t of their names upon the plates of the gue&s;ts along with the napkins, and I have counted &s;everal times, to the number of eighteen different &s;orts, all exqui&s;ite in their kinds. I was ye&s;terday at Count <HI>Schoon|bourn,</HI> the vice-chancellor's garden, where I was invited to dinner. I mu&s;t own, I never &s;aw a place &s;o perfectly delightful as the <HI>Fauxbourg</HI> of Vienna. It is very large, and almo&s;t wholly compo&s;ed of delicious palaces. If the Emperor found it proper to permit the gates of the town to be laid open, that the Fauxbourgs might be joined to it, he would have one of the large&s;t and be&s;t built cities in Europe. Count Schoonbourn's villa is one of the mo&s;t magnificent; the furniture all rich brocades, &s;o well fancied and fitted up, nothing can look more gay and &s;plendid; not to &s;peak of a gallery, full of rarities of coral, mother of pearl, and through|out the whole hou&s;e a profu&s;ion of gilding, carving, fine paintings, the mo&s;t beautiful porcelain, &s;tatues of alaba&s;ter and ivory, and va&s;t orange and lemon trees in gilt pots. The dinner was perfectly fine and well ordered, and made &s;till more agreeable by the good humour of the Count. I have not yet been at court, being forced to &s;tay for my gown, without which there is no waiting on the Empre&s;s; though I am not without great impatience to &s;ee a beauty that has been the admiration of &s;o many different nations. When I have had that honour, I will not fail to let you know my real thoughts, always taking a particular plea&s;ure in communicating them to my dear &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<P>PERHAPS you'll laugh at me, for thanking you very gravely for all the obliging concern you expre&s;s for me.

Nothing of That kind ever was more magnificent; and I can ea&s;ily believe, what I am told, that the decorations and habits co&s;t the Emperor thirty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. The stage was built over a very large canal, and at the begin|ning of the &s;econd act, divided into two parts, di&s;cover|ing the water, on which there immediately came, from different parts, two fleets of little gilded ve&s;&s;els, that gave the repre&s;entation of a naval fight. It is not ea&s;y to imagine the beauty of this &s;cene, which I took par|ticular notice of. But all the re&s;t were perfectly fine in their kinds. The &s;tory of the Opera is the Enchant|ment of <HI>Alcina,</HI> which gives opportunities for great
<PB N="16" REF="041644_0025_101ABF9233F116B0">
variety of machines and changes of the &s;cenes, which are performed with a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;wiftne&s;s. The theatre is &s;o large that 'tis hard to carry the eye to the end of it, and the habits in the utmo&s;t magnificence to the number of one hundred and eight. No hou&s;e could hold &s;uch large decorations; but the ladies all &s;itting in the open air, expo&s;es them to great inconveniencies; for there is but one canopy for the imperial family; and the fir&s;t night it was repre&s;ented, a &s;hower of rain happening, the opera was broke off, and the company crowded away in &s;uch confu&s;ion, that I was almo&s;t &s;queezed to death.&mdash;But if their operas are thus delightful, their comedies are, in as high a degree, ridiculous. They have but one play-hou&s;e, where I had the curio&s;ity to go to a German comedy, and was very glad it happened to be the &s;tory of Amphitrion. As that &s;ubject has been already handled by a Latin, French and Engli&s;h poet, I was curious to &s;ee what an Au&s;train author would make of it. I under&s;tand enough of that language to comprehend the greate&s;t part of it, and be&s;ides I took with me a lady that had the goodne&s;s to explain to me every word. The way is to take a box, which holds four, for your&s;elf and company. The fixed price is a gold ducat. I thought the hou&s;e very low and dark; but I confe&s;s the commedy admirably recompen&s;ed that defect. I never laughed &s;o much in my life. It begun with <HI>Jupiter'</HI>s falling in love out of a peep-hole in the clouds, and ended with the birth of <HI>Hercules.</HI> But what was mo&s;t plea&s;ant was the u&s;e Jupiter made of his metamorpho&s;is, for you no &s;ooner &s;aw him under the figure of <HI>Amphitrion,</HI> but in&s;tead of flying to <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mena,</HI> with the raptures Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> puts into his mouth, he &s;ends for Amphitrion's taylor, and cheats him of a laced coat, and his banker of a bag of money, a Jew of a diamond ring, and be&s;peaks a great &s;upper in his name;
<PB N="17" REF="041644_0026_101AD1986E8A7978">
and the greate&s;t part of the comedy turns upon poor Amphitrion's being tormented by the&s;e people for their debts. <HI>Mercury</HI> u&s;es <HI>So&s;ia</HI> in the &s;ame manner. But I could not ea&s;ily pardon the liberty the poet has taken of larding his play with, not only indecent expre&s;&s;ions, but &s;uch gro&s;s words as I don't think our mob would &s;uffer from a mountebank. Be&s;ides, the two So&s;ia's very fairly let down their breeches in the direct view of the boxes, which were full of people of the fir&s;t rank that &s;eemed very well plea&s;ed with their entertainment, and a&s;&s;ured me this was a celebrated piece. I &s;hall con|clude my letter with this remarkable relation, very well worthy the &s;erious con&s;ideration of Mr. Collier. I won't trouble you with farewell compliments, which I think generally as impertinent, as courti&s;ies at leav|ing the room when the vi&s;it has been too long already.</P>

<P>THOUGH I have &s;o lately troubled you, my dear &s;i&s;ter, with a long letter, yet I will keep my promi&s;e in giving you an account of my fir&s;t going to Court. In order to that ceremony, I was &s;queezed up in a gown, and adorned with a Gorget and the other implements thereunto belonging, a dre&s;s very inconvenient, but which certainly &s;hows the neck and &s;hape to great advantage. I cannot forbear giving you &s;ome de&s;cription of the fa&s;hions here, which are more mon&s;trous and contrary to all common &s;en&s;e and
<PB N="18" REF="041644_0027_101AD19B56956AF8">
rea&s;on, than 'tis po&s;&s;ible for you to imagine. They build certain fabrics of gau&s;e on their heads, about a yard high, con&s;i&s;ting of three or four &s;tories fortified with numberle&s;s yards of heavy ribbon. The foun|dation of this &s;tructure is a thing they call a <HI>Bourl&eacute;,</HI> which is exactly of the &s;ame &s;hape and kind, but about four times as big as tho&s;e rolls our prudent milk-maids make u&s;e of to fix their pails upon. This machine they cover with their own hair, which they mix with a great deal of fal&s;e, it being a particular beauty to have their heads too large to go into a moderate tub. Their hair is prodigiou&s;ly powdered to conceal the mixture, and &s;et out with three or four rows of bod|kins (wonderfully large, that &s;tick out two or three inches from their hair) made of diamonds, pearls, red, green and yellow &s;tones, that it certainly requires as much art and experience to carry the load upright, as to dance upon May-day with the garland. Their whalebone petticoats outdo ours by &s;everal yards cir|cumference, and cover &s;ome acres of ground. You may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e how this extraordinary dre&s;s &s;ets off and improves the natural ugline&s;s, with which God Almighty has been plea&s;ed to endow them, gene|rally &s;peaking. Even the lovely Empre&s;s her&s;elf is obliged to comply, in &s;ome degree, with the&s;e ab&s;urd fa&s;hions, which they would not quite for all the world. I had a private audience (according to ceremony) of half an hour, and then all the other ladies were per|mitted to come and make their court. I was perfectly charmed with the Empre&s;s; I cannot however tell you that her features are regular; her eyes are not large, but have a lively look full of &s;weetne&s;s; her complexion the fine&s;t I ever &s;aw; her no&s;e and fore|head well made, but her mouth has ten thou&s;and charms, that touch the &s;oul. When &s;he &s;miles, 'tis
<PB N="19" REF="041644_0028_101AD19D8EEB6D70">
with a beauty and &s;weetne&s;s, that forces adoration. She has a va&s;t quantity of fine fair hair; but then her per&s;on!&mdash;one mu&s;t &s;peak of it poetically to do it rigid ju&s;tice; all that the poets have &s;aid of the mien of <HI>Juno,</HI> the air of <HI>Venus,</HI> come not up to the truth. The <HI>Graces</HI> move, with her; the famous &s;tatue of Medicis was not formed with more delicate proporti|ons; nothing can be added to the beauty of her neck and hands. Till I &s;aw them, I did not believe there were any in nature &s;o perfect, and I was almo&s;t &s;orry that my rank here did not permit me to ki&s;s them; but they are ki&s;&s;ed &s;ufficiently, for every body, that waits on her, pays that homage at their entrance, and when they take leave. When the ladies were come in, &s;he &s;at down to <HI>Quinze.</HI> I could not play at a game I had never &s;een before, and &s;he ordered me a &s;eat at her right hand, and had the goodne&s;s to talk to me very much, with that grace &s;o natural to her. I expected every moment, when the men were to come in to pay their court; but this drawing-room is very different from that of England; no man enters it but the grand ma&s;ter, who comes in to adverti&s;e the Em|pre&s;s of the approach of the Emperor. His Imperial Maje&s;ty did me the honour of &s;peaking to me in a very obliging manner, but he never &s;peaks to any of the other ladies, and the whole pa&s;&s;es with a gravity and air of ceremony that has &s;omething very formal in it. The Empre&s;s Amelia, dowager of the late Emperor Jo&s;eph, came this evening to wait on the reigning Empre&s;s, followed by the two arch-duche&s;&s;es her daughters, who are very agreeable young prin|ce&s;&s;es. Their Imperial Maje&s;ties ro&s;e and went to meet her at the door of the room, after which &s;he was &s;eated in an armed chair next the Empre&s;s and in the &s;ame manner at &s;upper, and there the men had the
<PB N="20" REF="041644_0029_101AD1B12EA8BF78">
permi&s;&s;ion of paying their court. The arch-duche&s;&s;es &s;at on chairs with backs without arms. The table was entirely &s;erved and all the di&s;hes &s;et on by the Empre&s;&s;es maids of honour, which are twelve young ladies of the fir&s;t quality. They have no &s;alary, but their chamber at court, where they live in a &s;ort of confinement, not being &s;uffered to go to the a&s;&s;em|blies or public places in town, except in compliment to the wedding of a &s;i&s;ter maid, whom the Empre&s;s always pre&s;ents with her picture &s;et in diamonds. The three fir&s;t of them are called <HI>Ladies of the Key,</HI> and wear gold keys by their &s;ides; but what I find mo&s;t plea&s;ant, is the cu&s;tom, which obliges them as long as they live, after they have left the Empre&s;s's &s;ervice, to make her &s;ome pre&s;ent every year on the day of her fea&s;t. Her Maje&s;ty is &s;erved by no mar|ried women but the <HI>Grande Maitre&s;&s;e,</HI> who is generally a widow of the fir&s;t quality, always very old, and is at the &s;ame time <HI>groom of the &s;tole</HI> and mother of the maids. The dre&s;&s;es are not, at all, in the figure they pretend to in England, being looked upon no other|wi&s;e than as downright chamber-maids. I had an audi|ence next day of the Empre&s;s-mother, a prince&s;s of great virtue and goodne&s;s, but who piques her&s;elf too much on a violent devotion. She is perpetually per|forming extraordinary acts of pennance, without hav|ing ever done any thing to de&s;erve them. She has the &s;ame number of maids of honour, whom &s;he &s;uf|fers to go in colours; but &s;he her&s;elf never quits her mourning; and &s;ure nothing can be more di&s;mal than the mourning here; even for a brother, there is not the lea&s;t bit of linen to be &s;een; all black crape in&s;tead of it. The neck, ears and &s;ide of the face are covered with a plated piece of the &s;ame &s;tuff, and the face that peeps out in the mid&s;t of it, looks as if it
<PB N="21" REF="041644_0030_101AD1B35921C6E0">
were pilloried. The widows wear over and above, a crape-forehead cloth, and in this &s;olemn weed, go to all the public places of diver&s;ion without &s;cruple. The next day I was to wait on the Empre&s;s Amelia, who is now at her palace of retirement, half a mile from the town. I had there the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing a diver&s;ion wholly new to me, but which is the common amu&s;ement of this court. The Empre&s;s her&s;elf was &s;eated on a little throne at the end of the fine alley in her garden, and on each &s;ide of her were ranged two parties of her ladies of quality, headed by two young arch-duche&s;&s;es, all dre&s;&s;ed in their hair, full of jewels, with fine light guns in their hands, and at proper di&s;|tances were placed three oval pictures, which were the marks to be &s;hot at. The fir&s;t was that of a CUPID, filling a bumper of Burgundy, and the motto, <HI>"'Tis ea&s;y to be valiant here."</HI> The &s;econd a FORTUNE holding a garland in her hand, the motto, <HI>"For her whom Fortune favours."</HI> The third was a SWORD with a laurel wreath on the point, the motto, <HI>"Here is no &s;hame to the vanqui&s;hed."</HI>&mdash;Near the Empre&s;s was a gilded trophy wreathed with flowers, and made of little crooks, on which were hung rich Turki&s;h handkerchiefs, tippets, ribbons, laces, &amp;c. for the &s;mall prizes. The Empre&s;s gave the fir&s;t with her own hand, which was a fine ruby ring &s;et round with dia|monds in a gold &s;nuff box. There was for a &s;econd, a little Cupid &s;et with brilliants, and be&s;ides the&s;e a &s;et of fine china for the tea table, encha&s;ed in gold, japan trunks, fans, and many gallantries of the &s;ame nature. All the men of quality at Vienna were &s;pec|tators; but the ladies only had permi&s;&s;ion to &s;hoot, and the arch-duche&s;s Amelia carried off the fir&s;t prize. I was very well plea&s;ed with having &s;een this enter|tainment, and I do not know but it might make as good
<PB N="22" REF="041644_0031_101AD1B4DAFB8438">
a figure as the prize &s;hooting in the AEneid, if I could write as well as Virgil. This is the favourite plea&s;ure of the Emperor, and there is rarely a week without &s;ome fea&s;t of this kind, which makes the young ladies &s;kilful enough to defend a &s;ort. They laughed very much to &s;ee me afraid to handle a gun. My dear &s;i&s;ter, you will ea&s;ily pardon an abrupt conclu&s;ion. I believe by this time you are ready to think I &s;hall never conclude at all.</P>

<P>I AM extremely rejoiced, but not at all &s;urpri&s;ed, at the long, delightful letter, you have had the good|ne&s;s to &s;end me. I know that you can think of an ab&s;ent friend even in the mid&s;t of a court, and you love to oblige, where you can have no view of a return, and I expect from you that you &s;hould love me, and think of me, when you don't &s;ee me. I have compa&s;&s;ion for the mortifications, that you tell me befal our little, old friend, and I pity her much more, &s;ince I know, that they are, only, owing to the bar|barous cu&s;toms of our country. Upon my word, if &s;he were here, &s;he would have no other fault but that of being &s;omething too young for the fa&s;hion, and &s;he has nothing to do but to tran&s;plant her&s;elf hither about &s;even years hence, to be again a young and blooming beauty. I can a&s;&s;ure you that wrinkles, or a &s;mall &s;toop in the &s;houlders, nay even grey hairs,
<PB N="23" REF="041644_0032_101AD1B853C9E718">
are no objection to the making new conque&s;ts, I know you cannot ea&s;ily figure to your&s;elf, a young fellow of five and twenty, ogling my Lady <HI>S&mdash;ff&mdash;k</HI> with pa&s;|&s;ion, or pre&s;&s;ing to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and the Counte&s;s of O&mdash;d from an Opera. But &s;uch are the &s;ights I &s;ee every day, and I don't perceive any body &s;urpri&s;ed at them but my&s;elf. A woman till five and thirty, is only looked upon as a raw girl, and can po&s;&s;ibly make no noi&s;e in the world till about forty. I don't know what your lady&s;hip may think of this matter, but 'tis a con&s;ide|rable comfort to me to know there is upon earth &s;uch a paradi&s;e for old women, and I am content to be in&s;ignificant at pre&s;ent, in the de&s;ign of returning when I am fit to appear no where el&s;e. I cannot help lamenting on this occa&s;ion, the pitiful ca&s;e of too many Engli&s;h ladies, long &s;ince retired to prudery and rata|fia, whom if their &s;tars had luckily conducted hither, would &s;till &s;hine in the fir&s;t rank of beauties. Be&s;ides that perplexing word <HI>reputation,</HI> has quite another meaning here than what you give it at London, and getting a lover, is &s;o far from lo&s;ing, that 'tis properly getting reputation; ladies being much more re&s;pected in regard to the rank of their lovers, than that of their husbands.</P>
<P>But what you'll think very odd, the two &s;ects that di|vide our whole nation of petticoats, are utterly unknown in this place. Here are neither <HI>Coquettes</HI> nor <HI>Prudes.</HI> No woman dares appear coquette enough to encourage two lovers at a time. And I have not &s;een any &s;uch prudes, as to pretend fidelity to their husbands, who are certainly the be&s;t-natured &s;et of people in the world, and look upon their wives' gallants as favour|ably, as men do upon their deputies, that take the trouble&s;ome part of their bu&s;ine&s;s off their hands. They have not however the le&s;s to do on that account;
<PB N="24" REF="041644_0033_101AD1BA76D8D908">
for they are generally deputies in another place them|&s;elves; in one world, 'tis the e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom for every lady to have two husbands, one that bears the name, and another that performs the duties. And the engagements are &s;o well known, that it would be a downright affront, and publicly re&s;ented, if you invi|ted a woman of quality to dinner, without, at the &s;ame time, inviting her two attendants of lover and husband, between whom &s;he &s;its in &s;tate with great gravity. The <HI>&s;ub-marriages</HI> generally la&s;t twenty years together, and the lady often commands the poor lover's e&s;tate, even to the utter ruin of his family. The&s;e connections, indeed, are as &s;eldom begun by any real pa&s;&s;ion, as other matches; for a man makes but an ill figure that is not in &s;ome commerce of this nature, and a woman looks out for a lover as &s;oon as &s;he's married, as part of her equipage, without which &s;he could not be genteel, and the fir&s;t article of the treaty is e&s;tabli&s;hing the pen&s;ion, which remains to the lady, in ca&s;e the gallant &s;hould prove incon&s;tant. This chargeable point of honour, I look upon as the real foundation of &s;o many wonderful in&s;tances of con&s;tancy. I really know &s;everal women of the fir&s;t quality, who&s;e pen&s;ions are as well known as their annual rents, and yet no body e&s;teems them the le&s;s; on the con|trary, their di&s;cretion would be called in que&s;tion if they &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected to be mi&s;tre&s;&s;es for nothing. A great part of their emulation con&s;i&s;ts in trying who &s;hall get mo&s;t; and having no intrigue at all is &s;o far a di&s;grace, that I'll a&s;&s;ure you, a lady who is very much my friend here, told me but ye&s;terday, how much I was obliged to her for ju&s;tifying my conduct in a conver&s;ation relating to me, where it was pub|licly a&s;&s;erted, that I could not po&s;&s;ibly have common &s;en&s;e, &s;ince I had been in town above a fortnight, and
<PB N="25" REF="041644_0034_101AD1BC00D42C68">
had made no &s;teps towards commencing an amount. My friend pleaded for me that my &s;tay was uncertain, and &s;he believed that was the cau&s;e of my &s;eeming &s;tu|pidity, and this was all &s;he could find to &s;ay in my ju&s;|tification. But one of the plea&s;ante&s;t adventures I ever met in my life; was la&s;t night, and it will give you a ju&s;t idea, in what a delicate manner the <HI>Belles pa&s;&s;ions</HI> are managed in this country. I was at the a&s;&s;embly of the Counte&s;s of&mdash;, and the young Count of&mdash;leading me down &s;tairs, a&s;ked me how long I was to &s;tay at Vienna; I made an&s;wer that my &s;tay depended on the Emperor, and it was not in my power to determine it. Well, Madam, (&s;aid he) whether your time here is to be longer or &s;horter, I think you ought to pa&s;s it agreeably, and to that end you mu&s;t engage in a <HI>little affair of the heart.</HI>&mdash;My heart (an&s;wered I gravely enough) does not en|gage very ea&s;ily, and I have no de&s;ign of parting with it. I &s;ee, Madam, (&s;aid he &s;ighing) by the ill nature of that an&s;wer, I am not to hope for it, which is a great mortification to me that am charmed with you. But, however, I am &s;till devoted to your &s;ervice, and &s;ince I am not worthy of entertaining you my&s;elf, do me the honour of letting me know, whom you like be&s;t among&s;t us, and I'll engage to manage the affair entirely to your &s;atisfaction. You may judge in what manner I &s;hould have received this compliment in my own country; but I was well enough acquainted with the way of this, to know that he really intended me an obligation, and I thanked him with a very grave courte&s;y, for his zeal to &s;erve me, and only a&s;&s;ured him, I had no occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of it. Thus you &s;ee, my dear, that gallantry and good breeding are as dif|ferent, in different climates, as morality and religion. Who have the righte&s;t notions of both, we &s;hall never

<P>I WAS never more agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed than by your obliging letter. 'Tis a peculiar mark of my e&s;teem, that I tell you &s;o, and I can a&s;&s;ure you, that if I loved you one grain le&s;s than I do, I &s;hould be very &s;orry to &s;ee it &s;o diverting as it is. The mortal aver&s;ion I have to writing makes me tremble at the thoughts of a new corre&s;pondent, and I believe I di&s;obliged no le&s;s than a dozen of my London acquain|tance by refu&s;ing to hear from them, though I did verily think they intended to &s;end me very entertain|ing letters. But I had rather lo&s;e the plea&s;ure of reading &s;everal witty things, than be forced to write many &s;tupid ones. Yet in &s;pite of the&s;e con&s;idera|tions, I am charmed with the proof of your friend|&s;hip, and beg a continuation of the &s;ame goodne&s;s, though I fear the dulne&s;s of this will make you imme|diately repent of it. It is not from Au&s;tria that one can write with vivacity, and I am already infected with the phlegm of the country. Even their amours and their quarrels are carried on with a &s;urpri&s;ing temper, and they are never lively, but upon points of ceremony. There, I own, they &s;hew all their pa&s;|&s;ions, and 'tis not long &s;ince two coaches meeting in
<PB N="27" REF="041644_0036_101AD1BFF2F472E8">
a narrow &s;treet at night, the ladies in them not being able to adju&s;t the ceremonial of which &s;hould go back, &s;at there with equal gallantry till two in the morn|ing, and were both &s;o fully determined to die upon the &s;pot rather than yield, in a point of that impor|tance, that the &s;treet would never have been cleared till their deaths, if the Emperor had not &s;ent his guards to part them, and even then they refu&s;ed to &s;tir, till the expedient could be found out, of taking them both our in chairs, exactly in the &s;ame moment. After the ladies were agreed, it was with &s;ome dif|ficulty, that the pa&s;s was decided between the two coachmen, no le&s;s tenacious of their rank than the ladies. This pa&s;&s;ion is &s;o omnipotent in the brea&s;ts of the women, that even their husbands never die, but they are ready to break their hearts, becau&s;e that fatal hour puts an end to their rank, no widows hav|ing any place at Vienna. The men are not much le&s;s touched with this point of honour, and they don't only &s;corn to marry, but even to make love to any woman of family not as illu&s;trious as their own, and the pedigree is much more con&s;idered by them, than either the complexion or features of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. Happy are the She's that can number among&s;t their ance&s;tors, Counts of the Empire; they have neither occa&s;ion for beauty, money, nor good conduct to get them husbands. 'Tis true as to money, 'tis &s;eldom any advantage to the man they marry; the laws of Au&s;tria confine the woman's portion to two thou&s;and florins (about two hundred pounds Engli&s;h) and what|ever they have be&s;ide, remains in their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and di&s;po&s;al. Thus here are many ladies much richer than their husbands, who are however obliged to allow them pin-money agreeable to their quality; and I attribute to this con&s;iderable branch of prero|gative,
<PB N="28" REF="041644_0037_101AD1C36F436938">
the liberty that they take upon other occa&s;ions. I am &s;ure you, that know my lazine&s;s and extreme indifference on this &s;ubject, will pity me, intangled among&s;t all the&s;e ceremonies, which are a wonderful burden to me, though I am the envy of the whole town, having by their own cu&s;toms the pa&s;s before them all.

Upon days of ceremony they have no entrance at court, and on other days mu&s;t content them&s;elves with walking after every &s;oul, and being the very la&s;t taken notice of.

here differ from ours I mu&s;t write a whole quire of the dulle&s;t &s;tuff that ever was read, or printed without being read. Their dre&s;s agrees with the French or Engli&s;h in no one article, but wearing pet|ticoats. They have many fa&s;hions peculiar to them|&s;elves; they think it indecent for a widow ever to wear green or ro&s;e colour, but all the other gaye&s;t colours at her own di&s;cretion. The a&s;&s;emblies here are the only regular diver&s;ion, the opera's being always at court, and commonly on &s;ome particular occa&s;ion. Ma|dam <HI>Rabutin</HI> has the a&s;&s;embly con&s;tantly every night at her hou&s;e; and the other ladies, whenever they have a mind to di&s;play the magnificence of their apartments, or oblige a friend by complimenting them on the day of their Saint, they declare, that on &s;uch a day the a&s;&s;embly &s;hall be at their hou&s;e in honour to the fea&s;t of the Count or Counte&s;s&mdash;<HI>&s;uch a one.</HI> The&s;e days are called days of <HI>Gala,</HI> and all the friends or relations of the lady, who&s;e Saint it is, are obliged to appear in their be&s;t clothes and all their jewels.

Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> now I am &s;peaking of Vienna, I am &s;ure you expect I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething of the convents; they are of all &s;orts and &s;izes, but I am be&s;t plea&s;ed with that of <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> where the ea&s;e and neatne&s;s they &s;eem to live with, appears to me much more edifying than tho&s;e &s;tricter orders, where perpetual pennance and na&s;tine&s;&s;es mu&s;t breed di&s;content and wretchedne&s;s. The nuns are all of quality. I think there are to the number of fifty. They have each of them, a little cell perfectly clean, the walls of which are covered with pictures, more or le&s;s fine, according to their quality. A long white &s;tone gallery runs by all of them, furni&s;hed with the pictures of exemplary &s;i&s;ters; the chapel is extremely neat and richly adorned. But I could not forbear laughing at their &s;hewing me a wooden head of our Saviour, which they a&s;&s;ured me, &s;poke, during the &s;iege of Vienna; and, as a proof of it, bid me remark his mouth, which had been open ever &s;ince. Nothing can be more becoming than the dre&s;s of the&s;e nuns. It is a white robe, the &s;leeves of which are turned up with fine white callico, and their head dre&s;s the &s;ame, ex|cepting a &s;mall veil of black crape that falls behind. They have a lower &s;ort of &s;erving nuns, that wait on them as their chamber-maids. They receive all vi&s;its of women, and play at ombre in their chambers with permi&s;&s;ion of their Abbe&s;s, which is very ea&s;y to be obtained. I never &s;aw an old woman &s;o good-natured; &s;he is near four&s;core, and yet &s;hews very little &s;ign of decay, being &s;till lively and cheerful. She care&s;&s;ed me as if I had been her daughter, giving me &s;ome pretty things of her own work, and &s;weetmeats in abundance. The grate is not one of the mo&s;t rigid; it is not very hard to put a head through; and I don't doubt but a man, a little more &s;lender than
<PB N="31" REF="041644_0040_101AD1C9799FF400">
ordinary, might &s;queeze in his whole per&s;on. The young Count of <HI>Salamis</HI> came to the grate, while I was there, and the Abbe&s;s gave him her hand to ki&s;s. But I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find here, the only beautiful young woman I have &s;een at Vienna, and not only beautiful but genteel, witty and agreeable, of a great family and who had been the admiration of the town. I could not forbear &s;hewing my &s;urpri&s;e at &s;eeing a nun like her. She made me a thou&s;and obliging compliments, and de&s;ired me to come often. It will be an infinite plea&s;ure to me(&s;aid &s;he &s;ighing) but I avoid, with the greate&s;t care, &s;eeing any of my for|mer acquaintance, and whenever they come to our convent, I lock my&s;elf in my cell. I ob&s;erved tears come into her eyes, which touched me extremely, and I began to talk to her in that &s;train of tender pity &s;he in&s;pired me with; but &s;he would not own to me, that &s;he is not perfectly happy. I have &s;ince endeavoured to learn the real cau&s;e of her retirement, without being able to get any other account, but that every body was &s;urpri&s;ed at it, and no body gue&s;&s;ed the rea&s;on. I have been &s;everal times to &s;ee her; but it gives me too much melancholy to &s;ee &s;o ageeable a young creature buried alive. I am not &s;urpri&s;ed that nuns have &s;o often in&s;pired violent pa&s;&s;ions; the pity one naturally feels for them, when they &s;eem worthy of another de&s;tiny, making an ea&s;y way for yet more tender &s;entiments.

If I have been &s;ome time without an&s;wer|ing your letter, it is not, that I don't know how many thanks are due to you for it; or that I am &s;tupid enough to prefer any amu&s;ements, to the plea&s;ure of hearing from you; but after the profe&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem you have &s;o obligingly made me, I cannot help delay|ing, as long as I can, &s;hewing you, that you are mi&s;|taken. If you are &s;incere, when you &s;ay, you expect to be extremely entertained by my letters, I ought to be mortified at the di&s;appointment that I am &s;ure you will receive, when you hear from me; tho' I have done my be&s;t endeavours to find out &s;omething worth writing to you. I have &s;een every thing that was to be &s;een with a very diligent curio&s;ity. Here are &s;ome fine villa's, particularly, the late Prince of Lichten&s;tein's; but the &s;tatues are all modern, and the pictures not of the fir&s;t hands. 'Tis true, the Empe|ror has &s;ome of great value. I was ye&s;terday to &s;ee

the repo&s;itory, which they call his <HI>Trea&s;ure,</HI> where they &s;eem to have been more diligent in ama&s;&s;ing a great quantity of things, than in the choice of them. I &s;pent above five hours there, and yet there were very few things that &s;topped me long to con&s;ider them. But the number is prodigious, being a very long gal|lery filled, on both &s;ides, and five large rooms. There is a va&s;t quantity of paintings, among&s;t which are many fine miniatures, but the mo&s;t valuable pictures are a few of <HI>Corregio,</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>Titian</HI> being at the <HI>Favorita.</HI></P>
<P>The cabinet of jewels did not appear to me &s;o rich as I expected to &s;ee it. They &s;hewed me here a cup, about the &s;ize of a tea di&s;h, of one entire <HI>emerald,</HI> which they have &s;o particular a re&s;pect for, that only the Emperor has the liberty of touching it. There is a large cabinet full of curio&s;ities of clock-work, only one of which I thought worth ob&s;erving, that was a craw fi&s;h with all the motions &s;o natural, that it was hard to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the life.</P>
<P>The next cabinet was a large collection of <HI>Agates,</HI> &s;ome of them extremely beautiful and of an uncommon &s;ize, and &s;everal va&s;es of <HI>Lapis Lazuli.</HI> I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the cabinet of medals &s;o poorly furni&s;hed; I did not remark one of any value, and they are kept in a mo&s;t ridiculous di&s;order. As to the <HI>Antiques,</HI> very few of them de&s;erve that name. Upon my &s;aying they were modern, I could not forbear laugh|ing at the an&s;wer of the profound antiquary that &s;hewed them, that <HI>they were ancient enough, for to his knowledge they had been there the&s;e forty years;</HI> but the next cabinet diverted me yet better, being no|thing el&s;e but a parcel of wax babies, and toys in ivory, very well worthy to be pre&s;ented to children of five years old. Two of the rooms were wholly filled

with the&s;e trifles of all kinds, &s;et in jewels, among&s;t which I was de&s;ired to ob&s;erve a crucifix, that they a&s;&s;ured me had &s;poke very wi&s;ely to the Emperor <HI>Leopold.</HI> I won't trouble you with a catalogue of the re&s;t of the lumber, but I mu&s;t not forget to men|tion, a &s;mall piece of load&s;tone that held up an anchor of &s;teel too heavy for me to lift. This is what I thought mo&s;t curious in the whole trea&s;ure. There are &s;ome few heads of ancient &s;tatues; but &s;everal of them are defaced by modern additions. I fore&s;ee that you will be very little &s;atisfied with this letter, and I dare hardly a&s;k you, to be good-natured enough to charge the dulne&s;s of it, on the barrenne&s;s of the &s;ubject, and to overlook the &s;tupidity of</P>

<P>I HOPE my dear &s;i&s;ter wants no new proof of my &s;incere affection for her; but I am &s;ure if you do, I could not give you a &s;tronger than writing at this time, after three days, or, more properly &s;peak|ing, three nights and days, hard po&s;t-travelling.&mdash;The kingdom of Bohemia is the mo&s;t de&s;ert of any I have &s;een in Germany. The villages are &s;o poor, and the po&s;t-hou&s;es &s;o mi&s;erable, that clean &s;traw and fair water are ble&s;&s;ings not always to be met with, and better accommodation not to be hoped for.

Though I carried my own bed with me, I could not &s;ometimes find a place to &s;et it up in; and I rather cho&s;e to travel all night, as cold as it is, wrapped up in my furs, than go into the common &s;toves, which are filled with a mixture of all &s;orts of ill &s;cents.</P>
<P>This town was once the royal feat of the Bohemian King, and is &s;till the capital of the kingdom. There are yet &s;ome remains of its former &s;plendour, being one of the large&s;t towns in Germany, but, for the mo&s;t part, old built and thinly inhabited, which makes the hou&s;es very cheap. Tho&s;e people of qua|lity who cannot ea&s;ily bear the expence of Vienna, choo&s;e to re&s;ide here, where they have a&s;&s;emblies, mu&s;ic, and all other diver&s;ions, (tho&s;e of a court ex|cepted) at very moderate rates, all things being here in great abundance, e&s;pecially, the be&s;t wild fowl I ever ta&s;ted. I have already been vi&s;ited by &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable ladies, who&s;e relations I know at Vienna. They are dre&s;&s;ed after the fa&s;hions there, after the manner that the people at Exeter imitate tho&s;e of London; that is, their imitation is more exce&s;&s;ive than the original. 'Tis not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe what extraordinary figures they make. The per&s;on is &s;o much lo&s;t between head-dre&s;s and petticoat, that they have as much occa&s;ion to write upon their backs, <HI>"This is a Woman,"</HI> for the information of travellers, as ever &s;ign-po&s;t painter had to write, <Q><HI>This is a Bear.</HI></Q> I will not forget to write to you again from Dre&s;den and Leipzig, being much more &s;olici|tous to content your curio&s;ity, than to indulge my own repo&s;e.</P>

<P>I BELIEVE, dear &s;i&s;ter, you will ea&s;ily forgive my not writing to you from Dre&s;den, as I pro|mi&s;ed, when I tell you, that I never went out of my chai&s;e from Prague to this place. You may imagine how heartily I was tired with twenty-four hours po&s;t-travelling, without &s;leep or refre&s;hment (for I can never &s;leep in a coach however fatigued.) We pa&s;|&s;ed by moon-&s;hine, the frightful precipices that divide Bohemia from Saxony, at the bottom of which runs the river Elbe; but I cannot &s;ay, that I had rea&s;on to fear drowning in it, being perfectly convinced, that in ca&s;e of a tumble, it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible to come alive to the bottom. In many places the road is &s;o narrow, that I could not di&s;cern an inch of &s;pace between the wheels and the precipice. Yet I was &s;o good a wife not to wake Mr. W&mdash;y, who was fa&s;t a&s;leep by my &s;ide, to make him &s;hare in my fears, &s;ince the danger was unavoidable, till I perceived by the bright light of the moon, our po&s;tillions nod|ding on hor&s;e-back, while the hor&s;es were on a full gallop. Then indeed I thought it very convenient to call out to de&s;ire them to look where they were going. My calling waked Mr. W&mdash;y, and he was much more &s;urpri&s;ed than my&s;elf at the &s;ituation we were in, and a&s;&s;ured me that he pa&s;&s;ed the Alps five times in different places, without ever having gone a road &s;o dangerous. I have been told &s;ince, that 'tis
<PB N="37" REF="041644_0046_101AD1D6F89B7480">
common to find the bodies of travellers in the Elbe, but thank God that was not our de&s;tiny, and we came &s;afe to Dre&s;den, &s;o much tired with fear and fatigue, it was not po&s;&s;ible for me to compo&s;e my&s;elf to write. After pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e dreadful rocks, Dre&s;den appeared to me a wonderfully agreeable &s;ituation, in a fine large place on the banks of the Elbe. I was very glad to &s;tay there a day to re&s;t my&s;elf. The town is the neate&s;t. I have &s;een in Germany; mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are new built; the Elector's palace is very hand&s;ome, and his repo&s;itory full of curio&s;ities of different kinds, with a collection of medals very much e&s;teemed. Sir&mdash;, our King's Envoy, came to &s;ee me here, and Madam de L&mdash;, whom I knew in London, when her husband was Mini&s;ter to the King of Poland there. She offered me all things in her power to entertain me, and brought &s;ome ladies with her, whom &s;he pre&s;ented to me. The Saxon ladies re&s;em|ble the Au&s;trian no more, than the Chine&s;e do tho&s;e of London; they are very genteely dre&s;&s;ed after the Engli&s;h and French modes, and have, generally, pretty faces, but they are the mo&s;t determined <HI>Minaudieres</HI> in the whole world. They would think it a mortal &s;in again&s;t good breeding, if they either &s;poke or moved in a natural manner. They all affect a little &s;oft li&s;p, and a pretty <HI>pitty pat</HI> &s;tep; which female frailties ought, however, to be forgiven them in fa|vour of their civility and good nature to &s;trangers, which I have a great deal of rea&s;on to prai&s;e.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Cozelle</HI> is kept pri&s;oner in a me|lancholy ca&s;tle, &s;ome leagues from hence, and I can|not forbear telling you what I have heard of her, becau&s;e it &s;eems to me very extraordinary, though I fore&s;ee I &s;hall &s;well my letter to the &s;ize of a pacquet.&mdash;She was mi&s;tre&s;s to the King of Poland (Elector of
<PB N="38" REF="041644_0047_101AD1D965FA5DC8">
Saxony) with &s;o ab&s;olute a dominion over him, that never any lady had &s;o much power in that court. They tell a plea&s;ant &s;tory of his Maje&s;ty's fir&s;t decla|ration of love, which he made in a vi&s;it to her, bring|ing in one hand a bag of a hundred thou&s;and crowns, and in the other a hor&s;e-&s;hoe, which he &s;napped a&s;under before her face, leaving her to draw the con|&s;equences of &s;uch remarkable proofs of <HI>&s;trength</HI> and <HI>liberality.</HI> I know not which charmed her mo&s;t, but &s;he con&s;ented to leave her husband and to give her|&s;elf up to him intirely, being divorced publicly, in &s;uch a manner as by their laws, permits either party to marry again. God knows whether it was at this time, or in &s;ome other fond fit, but 'tis certain the king had the weakne&s;s to make her a formal contract of marriage; which, though it could &s;ignify nothing during the life of the Queen, plea&s;ed her &s;o well, that &s;he could not be contented, without telling it to all the people &s;he &s;aw, and giving her&s;elf the airs of a Queen. Men endure every thing while they are in love; but when the exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion was cooled by long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, his Maje&s;ty begun to reflect on the ill con&s;equences of leaving &s;uch a paper in her hands, and de&s;ired to have it re&s;tored to him. But &s;he rather cho&s;e to endure all the mo&s;t violent effects of his anger than give it up; and though &s;he is one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t avaritious ladies of her coun|try, &s;he has refu&s;ed the offer of the continuation of a large pen&s;ion, and the &s;ecurity of a va&s;t &s;um of money &s;he has ama&s;&s;ed, and has, at la&s;t, provoked the King to confine her per&s;on to a ca&s;tle, where &s;he endures all the terrors of a &s;trait impri&s;onment, and remains &s;till inflexible either to threats or promi&s;es. Her violent pa&s;&s;ions have brought her indeed into fits, which 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed will &s;oon put an end to her

<P>I could have wi&s;hed Mr. W&mdash;y's bu&s;ine&s;s had permitted him a longer &s;tay at Dre&s;den.</P>
<P>Perhaps I am partial to a town where they profe&s;s the Prote&s;tant Religion, but every thing &s;eemed to me with quite another air of politene&s;s, than I have found in other places. <HI>Leip&s;ic,</HI> where I am at pre|&s;ent, is a town very con&s;iderable for its trade, and I take this opportunity of buying page's liveries, gold &s;tuffs for my&s;elf, &amp;c. all things of that kind being at lea&s;t double the price at Vienna, partly becau&s;e of the exce&s;&s;ive cu&s;toms, and partly through want of genius and indu&s;try in the people, who make no one &s;ort of thing there, &s;o that the ladies are obliged to &s;end, even for their &s;hoes, out of Saxony. The fair here is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in Germany, and the re&s;ort of all the people of quality, as well as of the merchants. This is al&s;o a fortified town, but I avoid ever mentioning fortifications, being &s;en&s;ible that I know not how to &s;peak of them. I am the more ea&s;y under my ignorance, when I reflect that I am &s;ure you'll willingly forgive the omi&s;&s;ion; for if I made you the mo&s;t exact de&s;cription of all the ravelins and ba&s;tions I &s;ee in my travels, I dare &s;wear you would a&s;k me what is a ravelin? and what is a ba&s;tion?</P>

<P>I RECEIVED your lady&s;hip's letter but the day before I left Vienna, though, by the date, I ought to have had it much &s;ooner; but nothing was ever wor&s;e regulated than the po&s;t in mo&s;t parts of Germany. I can a&s;&s;ure you&punc; the pacquet at Prague was behind my chai&s;e, and in that manner conveyed to Dre&s;den, &s;o that the &s;ecrets of half the country were at my mercy, if I had had any curio&s;ity for them. I would not longer delay my thanks for yours, though the number of my acquaintances here, and my duty of attending at court, leaves me hardly any time to di&s;po&s;e of. I am extremely plea&s;ed that I can tell you, without flattery or partiality, that our young Prince<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The father of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty.</NOTE> has all the accompli&s;hments that 'tis po&s;&s;ible to have at his age, with an air of &s;pright|line&s;s and under&s;tanding, and &s;omething &s;o very en|gaging and ea&s;y in his behaviour, that he needs not the advantage of his rank to appear charming. I had the honour of a long conver&s;ation with him la&s;t night, before the King came in. His governor re|tired on purpo&s;e (as he told me afterwards) that I might make &s;ome judgment of his genius, by hear|ing him &s;peak without con&s;traint; and I was &s;urpri&s;ed at the quickne&s;s and politene&s;s, that appeared in every thing he &s;aid, joined to a per&s;on perfectly agreeable, and the fine fair hair of the Prince&s;s.</P>

This town is neither large nor hand&s;ome; but the palace is capable of holding a much greater court than that of St. James. The King has had the goodne&s;s to appoint us a lodging in one part of it, without which we &s;hould have been very ill accom|modated; for the va&s;t number of Engli&s;h crowds the town &s;o much, 'tis very good luck to get one &s;orry room in a mi&s;erable tavern.

I have now made the <HI>Tour</HI> of Germany, and cannot help ob&s;erving a con&s;iderable difference between travel|ling here and in England. One &s;ees none of tho&s;e fine &s;eats of noblemen, &s;o common among&s;t us, nor any thing like a country gentleman's hou&s;e, though they have many &s;ituations perfectly fine. But the whole people are divided into ab&s;olute &s;overeignties, where all the riches and magnificence are at court, or into communities of merchants, &s;uch as Nurenburgh and Frankfort, where they live always in town for the convenience of trade. The King's company of French comedians play here every night. They are very well dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;ome of them not ill actors. His Maje&s;ty dines and &s;ups con&s;tantly in public.

<P>I AM very glad my dear Lady R&mdash;, that you have been &s;o well plea&s;ed, as you tell me, at the re|port of my returning to England; though, like other plea&s;ures, I can a&s;&s;ure you it has no real foundation. I hope you know me enough to take my word again&s;t any report concerning me. 'Tis true, as to di&s;tance of place, I am much nearer to London than I was &s;ome weeks ago; but as to the thoughts of a return. I never was farther off in my life. I own, I could with great joy indulge the plea&s;ing hopes of &s;eeing you and the very few others that &s;hare my e&s;teem; but while Mr. W&mdash;is determined to proceed in his de&s;ign, I am determined to follow him.&mdash;I am running on upon my own affairs, that is to &s;ay, I am going to write very dully, as mo&s;t people do, when they write of them&s;elves. I will make ha&s;te to change the di&s;agreeable &s;ubject, by telling you, that I am now got into the region of beauty. All the women have, literally, ro&s;y cheeks, &s;nowy foreheads and bo&s;oms, jet eyebrows, and &s;carlet lips, to which they generally add coal-black hair. Tho&s;e perfec|tions never leave them, till the hour of their deaths, and have a very fine effect by candle light; but I could wi&s;h they were hand&s;ome with a little more variety. They re&s;emble one another as much as Mrs. <HI>Salmon</HI>'s court of Great-Britain, and are in as much danger of melting away, by too near approach|ing

the fire, which they, for that rea&s;on, carefully avoid, though 'tis now &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive cold weather, that I believe they &s;uffer extremely by that piece of &s;elf-denial. The &s;now is already very deep, and the people begin to &s;lide about in their <HI>Traineaus.</HI> This is a favourite diver&s;ion all over Germany. They are little machines fixed upon a &s;ledge, that hold a lady and a gentleman, and are drawn by one hor&s;e. The gentleman has the honour of driving, and they move with a prodigious &s;wiftne&s;s. The lady, the hor&s;e and the Traineau, are all as fine as they can be made, and when there are many of them together, 'tis a very agreeable &s;how. At Vienna, where all pieces of magnificence are carried to exce&s;s, there are &s;ome|times machines of this kind, that co&s;t five or &s;ix hundred pounds Engli&s;h. The Duke of Wolfenbut|tle is now at this court; you know he is nearly re|lated to our King, and uncle to the remaining Em|pre&s;s, who is, I believe, the mo&s;t beautiful Prince&s;s upon earth. She is now with child, which is all the con&s;olation of the Imperial Court for the lo&s;s of the Arch-duke. I took my leave of her the day before I left Vienna, and &s;he begun to &s;peak to me, with &s;o much grief and tenderne&s;s of the death of that young Prince, I had much ado to with-hold my tears. You know that I am not at all partial to people for their titles; but I own, that I love that charming Prin|ce&s;s (if I may u&s;e &s;o familiar an expre&s;&s;ion) and if I had not, I &s;hould have been very much moved at the tragical end of an only &s;on, born after being &s;o long de&s;ired, and at length killed by want of good management, weaning him in the beginning of the winter.

<P>I RECEIVED yours, dear &s;i&s;ter, the very day I left Hanover. You may ea&s;ily imagine I was then in too great a hurry to an&s;wer it, but you &s;ee I take the fir&s;t opportunity of doing my&s;elf that plea&s;ure. I came here the 15th, very late at night, after a terrible journey, in the wor&s;t roads and weather that ever poor traveller &s;uffered. I have taken this little fatigue, merely to oblige the reign|ing Empre&s;s, and carry a me&s;&s;age from her Imperial Maje&s;ty to the Duche&s;s of Blankenburg, her mo|ther, who is a Prince&s;s of great addre&s;s and good breeding, and may be &s;till called a fine woman. It was &s;o late when I came to this town, I did not think it proper to di&s;turb the Duke and Duche&s;s with the news of my arrival; &s;o I took up my quarters in a mi&s;erable inn; but as &s;oon as I had &s;ent my compli|ments to their Highne&s;&s;es, they immediately &s;ent me their own coach and &s;ix hor&s;es, which had however enough to do to draw us up the very high hill on which the ca&s;tle is &s;ituated.

the language enough to pay my devotions in it. You will not forgive me, if I do not &s;ay &s;omething of Hanover; I cannot tell you that the town is either large or magnificent. The opera-hou&s;e, which was built by the late Elector, is much finer than that of Vienna. I was very &s;orry that the ill weather did not permit me to &s;ee <HI>Hernhau&s;en</HI> in all its beauty; but in &s;pite of the &s;now, I thought the gardens very fine. I was particularly &s;urpri&s;ed, at the va&s;t number of orange trees, much larger than any I have ever &s;een in England, though this cli|mate is certainly colder. But I had more rea&s;on to wonder, that night at the King's table, to &s;ee a pre&s;ent from a gentleman of this country, of two large ba&s;kets full of ripe oranges and lemons of dif|ferent &s;orts, many of which were quite new to me; and what I thought worth all the re&s;t, two ripe <HI>Anana&s;&s;es,</HI> which, to my ta&s;te, are a fruit perfectly delicious. You know they are naturally the growth of <HI>Brazil,</HI> and I could not imagine how they came here but by enchantment. Upon enquiry, I learn't that they have brought their &s;toves to &s;uch perfec|tion, they lengthen their &s;ummer as long as they plea&s;e, giving to every plant the degree of heat it would receive from the &s;un in its native &s;oil. The effect is very near the &s;ame; I am &s;urpri&s;ed we do not practi&s;e, in England, &s;o u&s;eful an invention. This reflection leads me to con&s;ider our ob&s;tinacy in &s;ha|king with cold five months in the year, rather than make u&s;e of &s;toves, which are certainly one of the greate&s;t conveniencies of life. Be&s;ides, they are &s;o far from &s;poiling the form of a room, that they add very much to the magnificence of it, when they are painted and gilt, as they are at Vienna, or at Dre&s;|den, where they are often in the &s;hapes of china

<P>I HAVE ju&s;t received here at Vienna, your lady|&s;hip's compliments on my return to England, &s;ent me from Hanover. You &s;ee, Madam, all things that are a&s;&s;erted with confidence, are not ab&s;olutely true; and that you have no &s;ort of rea&s;on to com|plain of me for making my de&s;igned return a my&s;|tery to you, when, you &s;ay, all the world are informed of it. You may tell all the world in my name, that they are never &s;o well informed of my affairs as I am my&s;elf, that I am very po&s;itive I am at this time at Vienna, where the carnival is begun, and all &s;orts of diver&s;ions are carried to the greate&s;t height, except that of ma&s;quing, which is never permitted during a war with the Turks. The balls are in public places, where the men pay a gold ducat at entrance, but the ladies nothing. I am told that
<PB N="48" REF="041644_0057_101AD1EF5192D720">
the&s;e hou&s;es get &s;ometimes a thou&s;and ducats in a night. They are very magnificently furni&s;hed, and the mu&s;ic good, if they had not that dete&s;table cu&s;|tom of mixing hunting horns with it, that almo&s;t deafen the company. But that noi&s;e is &s;o ageeable here, they never make a concert without them. The ball always concludes with Engli&s;h country dances, to the number of thirty or forty couple, and &s;o ill danced, that there is very little plea&s;ure in them. They know but half a dozen, and they have danced them over and over the&s;e fifty years. I would fain have taught them &s;ome new ones, but I found it would be &s;ome months labour to make them compre|hend them. La&s;t night there was an Italian comedy acted at court. The &s;cenes were pretty, but the comedy it&s;elf &s;uch intolerable low farce, without either wit or humour, that I was &s;urpri&s;ed how all the court could &s;et there attentively for four hours together. No women are &s;uffered to act on the &s;tage, and the men dre&s;&s;ed, like them, were &s;uch aukward figures, they very much added to the ridi|cule of the &s;pectacle. What completed the diver|&s;ion was the exce&s;&s;ive cold, which was &s;o great I thought I &s;hould have died there. It is now the very extremity of the winter here; the Danube is entirely frozen, and the weather not to be &s;upported without &s;toves and furs; but, however, the air &s;o clear, almo&s;t every body is well, and colds not half &s;o common as in England. I am per&s;uaded there cannot be a purer air, nor more whole&s;ome than that of Vienna. The plenty and excellence of all &s;orts of provi&s;ions are greater here than in any place I ever was before, and 'tis not very expen&s;ive to keep a &s;plendid table. 'Tis really a plea&s;ure to pa&s;s through the markets, and &s;ee the abundance of what we
<PB N="49" REF="041644_0058_101AD1F25AF62D08">
&s;hould think rarities, of fowls and veni&s;on, that are daily brought in from Hungary and Bohemia. They want nothing but &s;hell-fi&s;h, and are &s;o fond of oy&s;ters, that they have them &s;ent from Venice, and eat them very greedily, &s;tink or not &s;tink. Thus I obey your commands, Madam, in giving you an account of Vienna, though I know you will not be &s;atisfied with it. You chide me for my lazine&s;s in not tel|ling you a thou&s;and agreeable and &s;urpri&s;ing things, that you &s;ay you are &s;ure I have &s;een and heard. Upon my word, Madam, 'tis my regard to truth, and not lazine&s;s, that I do not entertain you with as many prodigies as other travellers u&s;e to divert their readers with. I might ea&s;ily pick up wonders in every town I pa&s;s through, or tell you a long &s;eries of Popi&s;h miracles, but I cannot fancy that there is any thing new in letting you know that prie&s;ts will lie, and the mob believe, all the world over. Then as for news, that you are &s;o inqui&s;itive about, how can it be entertaining to you (that don't know the people) that the Prince of&mdash;has for&s;aken the Counte&s;s of&mdash;? or that the Prince&s;s <HI>&s;uch a one,</HI> has an intrigue with Count <HI>&s;uch a one?</HI> Would you have me write novels like the Counte&s;s of D'&mdash;, and is it not better to tell you a plain truth,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Vienna,</HI> <DATE>Jan. 16, O. S. 1717.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now, dear &s;i&s;ter, to take leave of you for a long time, and of Vienna for ever, de&s;igning, to-morrow, to begin my journey through Hungary in &s;pite of the exce&s;&s;ive cold, and deep &s;nows, which is enough to damp a greater courage than I am mi&s;|tre&s;s of. But my principle of <HI>pa&s;&s;ive obedience,</HI> car|ries me through every thing. I have had my audi|ence of leave of the Empre&s;s. His Imperial Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to be pre&s;ent when I waited on the reigning Empre&s;s, and, after a very obliging conver|&s;ation, both their Imperial Maje&s;ties invited me to take Vienna in my road back; but I have no thoughts, of enduring, over again, &s;o great a fatigue. I deli|vered a letter from the Duche&s;s of Blankenburg. I &s;taid but a few days at that court, though her High|ne&s;s pre&s;&s;ed me very much to &s;tay; and when I left her, engaged me to write to her. I wrote you a long letter from thence, which I hope you have received, though you don't mention it; but I believe I forgot to tell you one curio&s;ity in all the German courts, which I cannot forbear taking notice of: All the princes keep favourite dwarfs. The Emperor and Empre&s;s have two of the&s;e little mon&s;ters, as ugly as devils, e&s;pecially the female; but they are all bedawbed with diamonds, and &s;tand at her Maje|&s;ty's elbow in all public places. The Duke of Wol|fenbuttle has one, and the Duche&s;s of Blankenburg
<PB N="51" REF="041644_0060_101AD1F6D52446F8">
is not without hers, but indeed the mo&s;t proporti|onable I ever &s;aw. I am told the King of Denmark has &s;o far improved upon this fa&s;hion, that his dwarf is his chief mini&s;ter. I can a&s;&s;ign no rea&s;on for their fondne&s;s of the&s;e pieces of deformity, but the opi|nion all the ab&s;olute Princes have, that 'tis below them to conver&s;e with the re&s;t of mankind; and not to be quite alone, they are forced to &s;eek their companions among the refu&s;e of human nature; the&s;e creatures being the only part of their court privi|leged to to talk freely to them. I am at pre&s;ent confined to my chamber by a &s;ore throat, and am really glad of the excu&s;e to avoid &s;eeing people, that I love well enough to be very much mortified when I think I am going to part with them for ever. 'Tis true, the Au&s;trians, are not commonly the mo&s;t polite people in the world, nor the mo&s;t agreeable. But Vienna is inhabited by all nations, and I had formed to my&s;elf a little &s;ociety of &s;uch as were per|fectly to my own ta&s;te. And though the number was not very great, I could never pick up, in any other place, &s;uch a number of rea&s;onable, agreeable people. We were almo&s;t always together, and you know I have ever been of opinion, that a cho&s;en conver&s;ation, compo&s;ed of a few that one e&s;teems, is the greate&s;t happine&s;s of life. Here are &s;ome Spa|niards of both &s;exes, that have all the vivacity and genero&s;ity of &s;entiments antiently a&s;cribed to their nation; and could I believe, that the whole kingdom were like them, I &s;hould wi&s;h nothing more than to end my days there. The ladies of my acquaintance have &s;o much goodne&s;s for me, they cry whenever they &s;ee me, &s;ince I have determined to undertake this journey. And, indeed, I am not very ea&s;y when I reflect on what I am going to &s;uffer. Almo&s;t
<PB N="52" REF="041644_0061_101AD1F8FAA8F7C0">
every body I &s;ee frights me with &s;ome new difficulty. Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> has been &s;o good as to &s;ay all the things he could to per&s;uade me to &s;tay till the Danube is thawed, that I may have the conveniency of going by water, a&s;&s;uring me, that the hou&s;es in Hungary are &s;uch, as are no defence again&s;t the weather, and that I &s;hall be obliged to travel three or four days between <HI>Buda</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;eek,</HI> without finding any hou&s;e at all, through de&s;art plains covered with &s;now; where the cold is &s;o violent, many have been killed by it. I own the&s;e terrors have made a very deep impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, becau&s;e I believe he tells me things truly as they are, and no body can be bet|ter informed of them.</P>
<P>Now I have named that great man, I am &s;ure you expect, I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething particular of him, having the advantage of &s;eeing him very often; but I am as unwilling to &s;peak of him at <HI>Vienna,</HI> as I &s;hould be to talk of <HI>Hercules</HI> in the court of <HI>Omphale,</HI> if I had &s;een him there. I don't know what com|fort other people find in con&s;idering the weakne&s;s of great men, (becau&s;e, perhaps, it brings them nearer to their level) but 'tis always a mortification to me, to ob&s;erve, that there is no perfection in humanity. The young Prince of Portugal is the admiration of the whole court; he is hand&s;ome and polite with a great vivacity. All the officers tell wonders of his gallantry the la&s;t campaign. He is lodged at court with all the honours due to his rank.&mdash;Adieu, dear &s;i&s;ter, this is the la&s;t account you will have from me of Vienna. If I &s;urvive my journey, you &s;hall hear from me again. I can &s;ay with great truth, in the words of <HI>Mone&s;es, I have long learnt to hold my&s;elf as nothing;</HI> but when I think of the fatigue my poor infant mu&s;t &s;uffer, I have all a mother's fond|ne&s;s

in my eyes, and all her tender pa&s;&s;ions in my heart.</P>
<P>P. S. I have written a letter to my lady&mdash;, that I believe &s;he won't like; and upon cooler reflec|tion, I think I had done better to have let it alone; but I was downright peevi&s;h at all her que&s;tions, and her ridiculous imagination, that I have certainly &s;een abundance of wonders which I keep to my&s;elf out of meer malice. She is very angry that I won't lie like other travellers. I verily believe &s;he expects I &s;hould tell her of the <HI>Anthropophagie,</HI> men who&s;e heads grow below their &s;houlders; however, pray &s;ay &s;omething to pacify her.</P>

<P>AT length, dear &s;i&s;ter, I am &s;afely arrived with all my family in good health at <HI>Peterwaradin;</HI> having &s;uffered &s;o little from the rigour of the &s;ea|&s;on (again&s;t which we were well provided by furs) and found &s;uch tolerable accommodation every where, by the care of &s;ending before, that I can hardly forbear laughing when I recollect all the frightful ideas that were given me of this journey. The&s;e, I &s;ee, were wholly owing to the tenderne&s;s of my Vienna friends, and their de&s;ire of keeping me with them for this winter. Perhaps it will not be di&s;a|greeable to you to give a &s;hort journal of my jour|ney, being through a country entirely unknown to you, and very little pa&s;&s;ed, even by the Hungarians them&s;elves, who generally choo&s;e to take the conve|niency of going down the Danube. We have had the ble&s;&s;ing of being favoured with finer weather than is common at this time of the year; though the &s;now was &s;o deep, we were obliged to have our
<PB N="55" REF="041644_0064_101AD1FEE0817110">
own coaches fixed upon <HI>Traineaus,</HI> which move &s;o &s;wift and &s;o ea&s;ily, 'tis by far the mo&s;t agreeable manner of travelling po&s;t, We came to <HI>Raab</HI> (the &s;econd day from Vienna) on the &s;eventeenth in&s;tant, where Mr. W&mdash;&s;ending word of our arrival to the governor, the be&s;t hou&s;e in the town was provided for us, the garri&s;on put under arms, a guard ordered at our door, and all other honours paid to us. The governor and all other officers immediately waited on Mr. W&mdash;, to know if there was any thing to be done for his &s;ervice. The bi&s;hop of <HI>Teme&s;war</HI> came to vi&s;it us, with great civility, earne&s;tly pre&s;|&s;ing us to dine with him next day; which we refu|&s;ing, as being re&s;olved to pur&s;ue our journey, he &s;ent us &s;everal baskets of winter fruit, and a great variety of Hungarian wines, with a young hind ju&s;t killed. This is a prelate of great power in this country, of the ancient family of <HI>Nada&s;ti,</HI> &s;o con&s;iderable, for many ages, in this kingdom. He is a very polite, agreeable, cheerful old man, wearing the Hungarian habit, with a venerable white beard down to his gir|dle.&mdash;<HI>Raab</HI> is a &s;trong own, well garri&s;oned and fortified, and was a long time the frontier town be|tween the Turki&s;h and German Empires. It has its name from the river <HI>Rab,</HI> on which it is &s;ituated, ju&s;t on its meeting with the Danube, in an open champain country. It was fir&s;t taken by the Turks under the command of Ba&s;&s;a <HI>Sinan,</HI> in the reign of Sultan <HI>Amurath</HI> III. in the year fifteen hundred ninety-four. The governor being &s;uppo&s;ed to have betrayed it, was afterwards beheaded by the Empe|ror's command. The Counts of <HI>Swartzenburg</HI> and <HI>Pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i</HI> retook it by &s;urpri&s;e 1598, &s;ince which time it has remained in the hands of the Germans, though the Turks once more attempted to gain it by &s;tra|tagem
<PB N="56" REF="041644_0065_101AD201CB4FF348">
in 1642. The cathedral is large and well built, which is all I &s;aw remarkable in the town. Leaving <HI>Comora</HI> on the other &s;ide of the river, we went the eighteenth to <HI>No&s;muhl,</HI> a &s;mall village, where, however, we made &s;hift to find tolerable ac|commodation. We continued two days travelling between this place and <HI>Buda,</HI> thro' the fine&s;t plains in the world, as even as if they were paved, and ex|tremely fruitful; but for the mo&s;t part de&s;art and uncultivated, laid wa&s;te by the long wars between the Turk and the Emperor; and the more cruel civil war, occa&s;ioned by the barbarous per&s;ecution of the Prote&s;tant religion, by the Emperor Leopold. That Prince has left behind him the character of an extraor|dinary piety, and was naturally of a mild merciful tem|per; but, putting his con&s;cience into the hands of a je&s;uit, he was more cruel and treacherous to his poor Hungarian &s;ubjects, than ever the Turk has been to the Chri&s;tians; breaking, without &s;cruple, his coronation oath, and his faith &s;olemnly given in many public treaties. Indeed nothing can be more melancholy than in travelling through Hungary, to reflect on the former flouri&s;hing &s;tate of that kingdom, and to &s;ee &s;uch a noble &s;pot of earth almo&s;t uninha|bited. Such are al&s;o the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of <HI>Buda</HI> (where we arrived very early the twenty &s;econd) once the royal &s;eat of the Hungarian kings, who&s;e palace there, was reckoned one of the mo&s;t beautiful buildings of the age, now wholly de&s;troyed, no part of the town having been repaired &s;ince the la&s;t &s;iege, but the fortifications and the ca&s;tle, which is the pre|&s;ent re&s;idence of the governor general <HI>Ragule,</HI> an officer of great merit. He came immediately to &s;ee us, and carried us in his coach to his hou&s;e, where I was received by his lady, with all po&s;&s;ible civility,
<PB N="57" REF="041644_0066_101AD2035066E9E0">
and magnificently entertained. This city is &s;ituated upon a little hill on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Danube. The ca&s;tle is much higher than the town, and from it the pro&s;pect is very noble. Without the walls lie a va&s;t number of little hou&s;es, or rather huts, that they call the <HI>Ra&s;cian</HI> town, being altogether inha|bited by that people. The governor a&s;&s;ured me it would furni&s;h twelve thou&s;and fighting men. The&s;e towns look very odd; their hou&s;es &s;tand in rows, many thou&s;ands of them &s;o clo&s;e together, that they appear, at a little di&s;tance, like old-fa&s;hioned thatched tents. They con&s;i&s;t, every one of them, of one hovel above, and another under ground; the&s;e are their &s;ummer and winter apartments. Buda was fir&s;t taken by <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent, in 1526, and lo&s;t the following year to Ferdinand the fir&s;t, King of Bohe|mia. <HI>Solyman</HI> regained it by the treachery of the garri&s;on, and voluntarily gave it into the hands of King <HI>John</HI> of Hungary, after who&s;e death, his &s;on being an infant, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> laid &s;iege to it, and the Queen-mother was forced to call Solyman to her aid. He indeed rai&s;ed the &s;iege; but left a Turki&s;h gar|ri&s;on in the town, and commanded her to remove her court from thence, which &s;he was forced to &s;ubmit to in 1541. It re&s;i&s;ted afterwards the &s;ieges laid to it, by the Marquis of Brandenburgh, in the year 1542; Count Schwartzenburg, in 1598; General Ro&s;worm, 1602; and the Duke of Lorrain, commander of the Emperor's forces, in 1684, to whom it yielded in 1686, after an ob&s;tinate defence, <HI>Apti Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> the go|vernor, being killed, fighting in the breach, with a Roman bravery. The lo&s;s of this town was &s;o im|portant, and &s;o much re&s;ented by the Turks, that it occa&s;ioned the depo&s;ing of their Emperor <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Fourth, the year following.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="041644_0067_101AD205712281A8">
We did not proceed on our journey till the twenty|third, when we pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Todowar,</HI> both con&s;iderable towns, when in the hands of the Turks, but now quite ruined. The remains, how|ever, of &s;ome Turki&s;h towns, &s;hew &s;omething of what they have been. This part of the country is very much over-grown with wood, and little fre|quented. 'Tis incredible what va&s;t numbers of wild fowl we &s;aw, which often live here to a good old age,&mdash;and <HI>undi&s;turb'd by guns, in quiet &s;leep.</HI>&mdash;We came the five and twentieth to <HI>Mohatch,</HI> and were &s;hewed the field near it, where <HI>Lewis,</HI> the young King of Hungary, lo&s;t his army and his life, being drowned in a ditch trying to fly from <HI>Balybeus,</HI> general of <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent. This battle opened the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age for the Turks into the heart of Hungary.&mdash;I don't name to you the little villa|ges, of which I can &s;ay nothing remarkable, but I'll a&s;&s;ure you, I have always found a warm &s;tove and great plenty, particularly of wild boar, veni&s;on and all kinds of <HI>Gibier.</HI> The few people that inhabit Hungary, live ea&s;ily enough; they have no money; but the woods and plains afford them provi&s;ion in great abundance; they were ordered to give us all things nece&s;&s;ary, even what hor&s;es we plea&s;ed to demand, <HI>gratis;</HI> but Mr. W&mdash;would not oppre&s;s the poor country people, by making u&s;e of this order, and always paid them to the full worth of what we had. They were &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed at this unexpected genero|&s;ity, which they are very little u&s;ed to, that they always pre&s;&s;ed upon us, at parting, a dozen of fat phea&s;ants, or &s;omething of that &s;ort for a pre&s;ent. Their dre&s;s is very <HI>primitive,</HI> being only a plain &s;heep's &s;kin, and a cap and boots of the &s;ame &s;tuff. You may ea&s;ily imagine this la&s;ts them many winters;
<PB N="59" REF="041644_0068_101AD20710D255E0">
and thus they have very little occa&s;ion for money. The twenty-&s;ixth, we pa&s;&s;ed over the frozen Danube, with all our equipage, and carriages. We met, on the other &s;ide, general <HI>Veterani,</HI> who invited us, with great civility, to pa&s;s the night at a little ca&s;tle of his, a few miles off, a&s;&s;uring us we &s;hould have a very hard day's journey to reach <HI>E&s;&s;ek.</HI> This we found but too true, the woods being very dangerous, and &s;carce pa&s;&s;able, from the va&s;t quantity of wolves that hoard in them. We came, however, &s;afe, though late, to E&s;&s;ek, where we &s;tayed a day, to di&s;patch a courier with letters to the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> of Belgrade; and I took that opportunity of &s;eeing the town, which is not very large, but fair built and well fortified. This was a town of great trade, very rich and popu|lous, when in the hands of the Turks. It is &s;ituated on the <HI>Drave,</HI> which runs into the Danube. The bridge was e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t extraordinary in the world, being eight thou&s;and paces long, and all built of oak. It was burnt, and the city laid in a&s;hes by Count <HI>Le&s;ly</HI> 1685, but was again repaired and fortified by the Turks, who however abandoned it in 1687. General <HI>Dunnewalt</HI> then took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for the Emperor, in who&s;e hands it has remained ever &s;ince, and is e&s;teemed one of the bulwarks of Hungary. The twenty-eighth we went to Bocorvar, a very large Ra&s;cian town, all built after the man|ner I have de&s;cribed to you. We were met there by Colonel&mdash;, who would not &s;uffer us to go any where but to his quarters, where I found his wife, a very agreeable Hungarian lady, and his niece and daughter, two pretty young women, crowded into three or four Ra&s;cian hou&s;es, ca&s;t into one, and made as neat and convenient as tho&s;e places are capable of being made. The Hungarian ladies are much
<PB N="60" REF="041644_0069_101AD20AA95D4B60">
hand&s;omer than tho&s;e of Au&s;tria. All the Vienna beauties are of that country. They are generally very fair and well &s;haped, and their dre&s;s, I think, is extremely becoming. This lady was in a gown of &s;carlet velvet, lined and faced with &s;ables, made exact to her &s;hape, and the &s;kirt falling to her feet. The &s;leeves are &s;trait to their arms, and the &s;tays buttoned before, with two rows of little buttons of gold, pearl, or diamonds. On their heads they wear a ta&s;&s;el of gold, that hangs low on one &s;ide, lined with &s;able, or &s;ome other fine fur.&mdash;They gave us a hand&s;ome dinner, and I thought the conver&s;ation very polite and agreeable. They would accompany us part of our way.&mdash;The twenty-ninth, we arrived here, where we were met by the commanding officer at the head of all the officers at the garri&s;on. We are lodged in the be&s;t apartment of the governor's hou&s;e, and entertained in a very &s;plendid manner, by the Emperor's order. We wait here till all points are adju&s;ted, concerning our reception on the Turki&s;h frontiers. Mr. W&mdash;'s courier, which he &s;ent from E&s;&s;ek, returned this morning, with the Ba&s;&s;a's an&s;wer in a pur&s;e of &s;carlet &s;attin, which the Interpreter here has tran&s;lated. 'Tis to promi&s;e him to be honourably received. I de&s;ired him to appoint where he would be met, by the Turki&s;h convoy.&mdash;He has di&s;|patched the courier back, naming Bet&s;ko, a village in the midway between Peterwaradin and Belgrade. We &s;hall &s;tay here till we receive his an&s;wer.&mdash;Thus, dear &s;i&s;ter, I have given you a very particular, and (I am afraid you'll think) a tedious account of this part of my travels. It was not an affectation of &s;hewing my reading that has made me tell you &s;ome little &s;craps of the hi&s;tory of the towns I have pa&s;&s;ed through. I have always avoided any thing of that

kind, when I &s;poke of places that I believe you knew the &s;tory of, as well as my&s;elf. But Hungary being a part of the world which I believe quite new to you, I thought you might read with &s;ome plea&s;ure an account of it, which I have been very &s;olicitous to get from the be&s;t hands. However, if you don't like it, 'tis in your power to forbear reading it.</P>

<P>I DID verily intend to write you a long letter from Peterwaraden, where I expected to &s;tay three or four days, but the Ba&s;&s;a here was in &s;uch ha&s;te to &s;ee us, that he di&s;patched the courier back (which Mr. W&mdash;had &s;ent to know the time he would &s;end the convoy to meet us) without &s;uffering him to pull off his boots. My letters were not thought important enough to &s;top our journey, and we left Peterwaradin the next day, being waited on by the chief officers of the garri&s;on, and a con&s;iderable con|voy of Germans and Ra&s;cians. The Emperor has &s;everal regiments of the&s;e people; but, to &s;ay the truth, they are rather plunderers than &s;oldiers; ha|ving no pay, and being obliged to furni&s;h their own
<PB N="62" REF="041644_0071_101AD20E5B93FB78">
arms and hor&s;es; they rather look like vagabond gyp&s;ies, or &s;tout beggars, than regular troops. I cannot forbear &s;peaking a word of this race of crea|tures who are very numerous all over Hungary. They have a patriarch of their own at Grand Cairo, and are really of the Greek church, but their ex|treme ignorance gives their prie&s;ts occa&s;ion to impo&s;e &s;everal new notions upon them. The&s;e fellows let|ting their hair and beard grow inviolate, make exactly the figure of the Indian Bramins. They are heirs|general to all the money of the laiety; for which, in return, they give them formal pa&s;&s;ports &s;igned and &s;ealed for heaven; and the wives and children only inherit the hou&s;e and cattle. In mo&s;t other points they follow the Greek church.&mdash;This little digre&s;&s;ion has interrupted my telling you we pa&s;&s;ed over the fields of <HI>Carlowitz,</HI> where the la&s;t great victory was obtained by Prince Eugene over the Turks. The marks of that glorious bloody day are yet recent, the field being yet &s;trewed with the &s;kulls and carca&s;&s;es of unburied men, hor&s;es and camels. I could not look, without horror, on &s;uch numbers of mangled human bodies, nor without reflecting on the inju&s;tice of war, that makes murder, not only nece&s;&s;ary, but meritorious. Nothing &s;eems to be a plainer proof of the <HI>irrationality</HI> of mankind (what|ever fine claims we pretend to rea&s;on) than the rage with which they conte&s;t for a &s;mall &s;pot of ground, when &s;uch va&s;t parts of fruitful earth lie quite unin|habited. 'Tis true, cu&s;tom has now made it unavoid|able; but can there be a greater demon&s;tration of want of rea&s;on, than a cu&s;tom being firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;o plainly contrary to the intere&s;t of man in general? I am a good deal inclined to believe Mr. <HI>Hobbs,</HI> that the <HI>&s;tate of nature,</HI> is a <HI>&s;tate of war;</HI> but thence I
<PB N="63" REF="041644_0072_101AD21086BC49F8">
conclude human nature not rational, if the word rea&s;on means common &s;en&s;e, as I &s;uppo&s;e it does. I have a great many admirable arguments to &s;upport this reflexion; I won't however trouble you with them, but return, in a plain &s;tile, to the hi&s;tory of my travels.</P>
<P>We were met at Bet&s;ko (a village in the midway between Belgrade and Peterwaradin) by an Aga of the Janizaries, with a body of Turks, exceeding the the Germans by one hundred men, though the Ba&s;&s;a had engaged to &s;end exactly the &s;ame number. You may judge by this of their fears. I am really per|&s;uaded, that they hardly thought the odds of one hundred men &s;et them even with the Germans; how|ever, I was very unea&s;y till they were parted, fear|ing &s;ome quarrel might ari&s;e notwith&s;tanding the <HI>parole</HI> given. We came late to Belgrade, the deep &s;nows making the a&s;cent to it very difficult. It &s;eems a &s;trong city, fortified, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, by the Danube; and on the &s;outh, by the river <HI>Save,</HI> and was formerly the barrier of Hungary. It was fir&s;t taken by Solyman the Magnificent; and &s;ince, by the Emperor's forces, led by the Elector of Bavaria. The Emperor held it only two years, it being reta|ken by the Grand Vizier. It is now fortified with the utmo&s;t care and &s;kill the Turks are capable of, and &s;trengthened by a very numerous garri&s;on, of their brave&s;t Janizaries, commanded by a Ba&s;&s;a <HI>Se|ra&s;kier (i. e.</HI> General;) though this la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion is not very ju&s;t; for to &s;ay truth, the Sera&s;kier, is com|manded by the Janizaries. The&s;e troops have an ab&s;olute authority here, and their conduct carries much more the a&s;pect of rebellion, than the appear|ance of &s;ubordination. You may judge of this by the following &s;tory, which at the &s;ame time, will
<PB N="64" REF="041644_0073_101AD2134F31D8C8">
give you an idea of the <HI>admirable</HI> intelligence of the Governor of Peterwardin, though &s;o few hours di&s;|tant. We were told by him at Peterwaradin, that the garri&s;on and inhabitants of Belgrade were &s;o weary of the war, they had killed their Ba&s;&s;a about two months ago, in a mutiny, becau&s;e he had &s;uf|fered him&s;elf to be prevailed upon, by a bribe of five pur&s;es (five hundred pound &s;terling) to give permi&s;&s;ion to the Tartars to ravage the German fron|tiers. We were very well plea&s;ed to hear of &s;uch favourable di&s;po&s;itions in the people; but when we came hither, we found the governor had been ill informed, and the real truth of the &s;tory to be this. The late Ba&s;&s;a fell under the di&s;plea&s;ure of his &s;ol|diers, for no other rea&s;on, but re&s;training their incur&s;ions on the Germans. They took it into their heads from that mildne&s;s, that he had intelligence with the enemy, and &s;ent &s;uch information to the Grand Signior at Adrianople; but, redre&s;s not com|ing quick enough from thence, they a&s;&s;embled them|&s;elves in a tumultuous manner, and by force dragged their Ba&s;&s;a before the Cadi and Mufti, and there demanded ju&s;tice in a mutinous way; one crying out, Why he protected the Infidels? Another, Why he &s;queezed them of their money? The Ba&s;&s;a, ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ing their purpo&s;e, calmly replied to them, that they a&s;ked him too many que&s;tions, and that he had but one life, which mu&s;t an&s;wer for all. They then immediately fell upon him with their &s;cymitars, (without waiting the &s;entence of their heads of the law) and in a few moments cut him in pieces. The pre&s;ent Ba&s;&s;a has not dared to puni&s;h the murder; on the contrary, he affected to applaud the actors of it, as brave fellows, that knew how to do them&s;elves ju&s;tice. He takes all pretences of throwing money

among&s;t the garri&s;on, and &s;uffers them to make lit|tle excur&s;ions into Hungary, where they burn &s;ome poor Ra&s;cian hou&s;es.</P>
<P>You may imagine, I cannot be very ea&s;y in a town which is really under the government of an in&s;olent &s;oldiery.&mdash;We expected to be immediately di&s;&s;mi&s;|&s;ed, after a night's lodging here; but the Ba&s;&s;a de|tains us till he receives orders from Adrianople, which may, po&s;&s;ibly, be a month a coming. In the mean time, we are lodged in one of the be&s;t hou&s;es, belonging to a very con&s;iderable man among&s;t them, and have a whole chamber of Janizaries to guard us. My only diver&s;ion is the conver&s;ation of our ho&s;t <HI>Achmet-beg,</HI> a title &s;omething like that of Count in Germany. His father was a great Ba&s;&s;a, and he has been educated in the mo&s;t polite Ea&s;tern learning, being perfectly &s;killed in the Arabic and Per&s;ian languages, and an extraordinary &s;cribe, which they call <HI>Effendi.</HI> This accompli&s;hment makes way to the greate&s;t preferments; but he has had the good &s;en&s;e to prefer an ea&s;y, quiet &s;ecure life, to all the dan|gerous honours of the Porte. He &s;ups with us every night, and drinks wine very freely. You can|not imagine how much he is delighted with the liberty of conver&s;ing with me. He has explained to me many pieces of Arabian poetry, which, I ob&s;erve, are in numbers, not unlike ours, generally of an alternate ver&s;e, and of a very mu&s;ical &s;ound. Their expre&s;&s;ions of love are very pa&s;&s;ionate and lively. I am &s;o much plea&s;ed with them, I really believe I &s;hould learn to read Arabic, if I was to &s;tay here a few months. He has a very good library of their books of all kinds; and, as he tells me, &s;pends the greate&s;t part of his life there. I pa&s;s for a great &s;cholar with him, by relating to him &s;ome of the
<PB N="66" REF="041644_0075_101AD216F7C00C88">
Per&s;ian tales, which I find are genuine. At fir&s;t, he believed I under&s;tood Per&s;ian. I have frequent di&s;|putes with him, concerning the difference of our cu&s;|toms, particularly the confinement of women. He a&s;&s;ures me, there is nothing at all in it; only, &s;ays he, we have the advantage, that when our wives cheat us, no body knows it. He has wit, and is more polite than many Chri&s;tian men of quality. I am very much entertained with him.&mdash;He has had the curio&s;ity to make one of our &s;ervants &s;et him an alphabet of our letters, and can already write a good Roman hand. But the&s;e amu&s;ements do not hinder my wi&s;hing heartily to be out of this place; though the weather is colder than I believe it ever was, any where, but in Greenland.&mdash;We have a very large &s;tove con&s;tantly kept hot, and yet the windows <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f the room are frozen on the in&s;ide.&mdash;God knows when I may have an opportunity of &s;ending this let|ter; but I have written it, for the di&s;charge of my own con&s;cience; and you cannot now reproach me, that one of yours makes ten of mine.

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Adrianople,</HI> <DATE>April 1, O. S. 1717.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now, Madam, fini&s;hed a journey that has not been undertaken by any Chri&s;tian, &s;ince the time of the Greek Emperors; and I &s;hall not regret all the fatigues I have &s;uffered in it, if it gives me an opportunity of amu&s;ing your R. H. by an account of places utterly unknown among&s;t us; the Emperor's Emba&s;&s;adors, and tho&s;e few Engli&s;h that have come hither, always going on the Danube to Nicopolis. But the river was now frozen, and Mr. W&mdash;was &s;o zealous for the &s;ervice of his Maje&s;ty, that he would not defer his journey to wait for the conveniency of that pa&s;&s;age. We cro&s;&s;ed the de&s;arts of Servia, almo&s;t quite over-grown with wood, though a country naturally fertile. The inhabitants are indu&s;trious; but the oppre&s;&s;ion of the pea&s;ants is &s;o great, they are forced to abandon their hou&s;es, and neglect their tillage; all they have being a prey to the Janizaries, whenever they plea&s;e to &s;eize upon it. We had a guard of five hundred of them, and I was almo&s;t in tears every day, to &s;ee their in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lencies in the poor villages through which we pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;After &s;even days travelling through thick wood<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, we came to Ni&s;&s;a, once the capital of Servia, &s;ituated in a fine plain on the river <HI>Ni&s;&s;ava,</HI> in a very good air, and &s;o fruitful a &s;oil, that the great plenty is hardly
<PB N="68" REF="041644_0077_101AD21C4F2FAA30">
credible. I was certainly a&s;&s;ured, that the quantity of wine la&s;t vintage was &s;o prodigious, that they were forced to dig holes in the earth to put it in, not having ve&s;&s;els enough in the town to hold it. The happine&s;s of this plenty is &s;carce perceived by the oppre&s;&s;ed people. I &s;aw here a new occa&s;ion for my compa&s;&s;ion. The wretches that had provided twenty waggons for our baggage from Belgrade hither for a certain hire, being all &s;ent back without payment, &s;ome of their hor&s;es lamed, and others killed, without any &s;atisfaction made for them. The poor fellows came round the hou&s;e weeping and tear|ing their hair and beards in a mo&s;t pitiful manner, without getting any thing but drubs from the in&s;olent &s;oldiers. I cannot expre&s;s to your R. H. how much I was moved at this &s;cene. I would have paid them the money, out of my own pocket, with all my heart; but it would only have been giving &s;o much to the Aga, who would have taken it from them without any remor&s;e. After four days journey from this place over the mountains, we came to <HI>Sophia,</HI> &s;itu|ated in a large beautiful plain on the river I&s;ca, and &s;urrounded with di&s;tant mountains. 'Tis hardly po&s;|&s;ible to &s;ee a more agreeable land&s;kip. The city it&s;elf is very large and extremely populous. Here are hot baths, very famous for their medicinal virtues.&mdash;Four days journey from hence we arrived at <HI>Philip|popolis,</HI> after having pa&s;&s;ed the ridges between the mountains of <HI>Haemus</HI> and <HI>Rhodope,</HI> which are always covered with &s;now. This town is &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing ground, near the river Hebrus, and is almo&s;t wholly inhabited by Greeks; here are &s;till &s;ome antient Chri&s;tian churches. They have a bi&s;hop; and &s;everal of the riche&s;t Greeks live here; but they are forced to conceal their wealth with great care, the appear|ance

of poverty (which includes part of its inconve|niencies) being all their &s;ecurity again&s;t feeling it in earne&s;t. The country from hence to Adrianople, is the fine&s;t in the world. Vines grow wild on all the hills, and the perpetual &s;pring they enjoy, makes every thing gay and flouri&s;hing. But this climate, happy as it &s;eems, can never be preferred to England, with all its fro&s;ts and &s;nows, while we are ble&s;&s;ed with an ea&s;y government, under a King, who makes his own happine&s;s con&s;i&s;t in the liberty of his people, and choo&s;es rather to be looked upon as their father than their ma&s;ter.&mdash;This theme would carry me very far, and I am &s;en&s;ible, I have already tired out your R.

<P>I AM now got into a new world, where every thing I &s;ee, appears to me a change of &s;cene; and I write to your lady&s;hip with &s;ome content of mind, hoping, at lea&s;t, that you will find the charm of novelty in my letters, and no longer reproach me, that I tell you nothing extraordinary. I won't trou|ble you with a relation of our tedious journey; but I mu&s;t not omit what I &s;aw remarkable at <HI>Sophia,</HI> one
<PB N="70" REF="041644_0079_101AD22023947988">
of the mo&s;t beautiful towns in the Turki&s;h Empire, and famous for its hot baths, that are re&s;orted to both for diver&s;ion and health. I &s;top'd here one day, on purpo&s;e to &s;ee them; and de&s;igning to go <HI>incognito,</HI> I hired a Turki&s;h coach. The&s;e voitures are not at all like ours, but much more convenient for the coun|try, the heat being &s;o great that gla&s;&s;es would be very trouble&s;ome. They are made a good deal in the manner of the Dutch &s;tage coaches, having woo|den lattices painted and gilded; the in&s;ide being al&s;o painted with ba&s;kets and no&s;egays of flowers, inter|mixed commonly with litle poetical mottos. They are covered all over with &s;carlet cloth, lined with &s;ilk, and very often richly embroidered and fringed. This covering entirely hides the per&s;ons, in them, but may be thrown back at plea&s;ure, and thus per|mit the ladies to peep through the lattices. They hold four people very conveniently, &s;eated on cu&s;hi|ons, but not rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e covered waggons, I went to the <HI>Bagnio</HI> about ten o'clock. It was already full of women. It is built of &s;tone, in the &s;hape of a dome, with no windows but in the roof, which gives light enough. There were five of the&s;e domes joined together, the outmo&s;t being le&s;s than the re&s;t, and &s;erving only as a hall, where the <HI>Portre&s;s</HI> &s;tood at the door. Ladies of quality generally give this wo|man a crown or ten &s;hillings, and I did not forget that ceremony. The next room is a very large one, paved with marble, and all round it are two rai&s;ed Sofas of marble, one above another. There were four fountains of cold water in this room, falling fir&s;t into marble ba&s;ons, and then running on the floor in little channels made for that purpo&s;e, which carried the &s;treams into the next room, &s;omething le&s;s than this,
<PB N="71" REF="041644_0080_101AD222EEEEE098">
with the &s;ame &s;ort of marble Sofas, but &s;o hot with &s;teams of &s;ulphur proceeding from the baths joining to it, 'twas impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tay there with one's clothes on. The two other domes were the hot baths, one of which had cocks of cold water turning into it, to temper it to what degree of warmth the bathers plea&s;ed to have.</P>
<P>I was in my travelling habit, which is a riding dre&s;s, and certainly appeared very extraordinary to them. Yet there was not one of them that &s;hewed the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;e or impertinent curio&s;ity, but received me with all the obliging civility po&s;&s;ible. I know no European court, where the ladies would have behaved them&s;elves in &s;o polite a manner to &s;uch a &s;tranger. I believe, upon the whole, there were two hundred women, and yet none of tho&s;e di&s;dainful &s;miles, and satyrical whi&s;pers, that never fail in our a&s;&s;emblies, when any body appears that is not dre&s;&s;ed exactly in the fa&s;hion. They repeated over and over to me. "UZELLE, PEK UZELLE," which is nothing but, <HI>Charming, very charming."</HI>&mdash;The fir&s;t Sofas were covered with cu&s;hions and rich carpets, on which &s;at the ladies; and on the &s;econd, their &s;laves behind them, but without any di&s;tinction of rank by their dre&s;s, all being in the &s;tate of nature, that is, in plain Engli&s;h, &s;tark naked, without any beauty or defect concealed. Yet there was not the lea&s;t wan|ton &s;mile or immode&s;t ge&s;ture among&s;t them. They walked and moved with the &s;ame maje&s;tic grace, which Milton de&s;cribes our General Mother with. There were many among them, as exactly proportioned as every any godde&s;s was drawn by the pencil of a Guido or Titian,&mdash;And mo&s;t of their &s;kins &s;hiningly white, only adorned by their beautiful hair, divided into many tre&s;&s;es, hanging on their &s;houlders, braided

either with pearl or ribbon, perfectly repre&s;enting figures of the graces.</P>
<P>I was here convinced of the truth of a reflection I have often made; <HI>that if it were the fa&s;hion to go naked, the face would be hardly ob&s;erved.</HI> I perceived that the ladies of the mo&s;t delicate &s;kins and fine&s;t &s;hapes, had the greate&s;t &s;hare of my admiration, though their faces were &s;ometimes le&s;s beautiful than tho&s;e of their companions. To tell you the truth, I had wickedne&s;s enough, to wi&s;h &s;ecretly, that Mr. <HI>Gervais</HI> could have been there invi&s;ible. I fancy it would have very much improved his art, to &s;ee &s;o many fine women naked, in different po&s;tures, &s;ome in conver&s;ation, &s;ome working, others drinking cof|fee or &s;herbet, and many negligently lying on their cu&s;hions, while their &s;laves (generally pretty girls of &s;eventeen, or eighteen) were employ'd in braiding their hair in &s;everal pretty fancies. In &s;hort, 'tis the woman's coffee-hou&s;e, where all the news of the town is told, &s;candal invented, &amp;c.&mdash;They gene|rally take this diver&s;ion once a week, and &s;tay there at lea&s;t four or five hours, without getting cold, by immediate coming out of the hot-bath into the cool room, which was very &s;urpri&s;ing, to me. The lady, that &s;eemed the mo&s;t con&s;iderable among&s;t them, entreated me to &s;it by her, and would fain have un|dre&s;&s;ed me for the bath, I excu&s;ed my&s;elf with &s;ome difficulty. They being however all &s;o earne&s;t in per|&s;uading me, I was at la&s;t forced to open my &s;hirt, and &s;hew them my &s;tays, which &s;atisfied them very well; for, I &s;aw, they believed I was locked up in that machine, and that it was not in my own power to open it, which contrivance they attributed to my husband.&mdash;I was charmed with their civility and beauty, and &s;hould have been very glad to pa&s;s more

<P>Adieu, Madam, I am &s;ure I have now entertained you, with an account of &s;uch a &s;ight, as you never &s;aw in your life, and what no book of travels could inform you of, as 'tis no le&s;s than death for a man to be found in one of the&s;e places.</P>

<P>YOU &s;ee that I am very exact in keeping the promi&s;e you engaged me to make. I know not, however, whether your curio&s;ity will be &s;atisfied with the accounts I &s;hall give you, tho' I can a&s;&s;ure you, the de&s;ire I have to oblige you to the utmo&s;t of my power, has made me very diligent in my inquiries and ob&s;ervations. 'Tis certain we have but very imperfect accounts of the manners and religion of the&s;e people. This part of the world being &s;eldom vi&s;ited, but by merchants, who mind little but their own affairs; or travellers, who make too &s;hort a &s;tay to be able to report any thing exactly of their own knowledge. The Turks are too proud to conver&s;e familiarly with merchants, who can only pick up &s;ome confu&s;ed informations, which are generally fal&s;e, and can give no better account of the ways here,

than a French Refug&eacute;e, lodging in a garret in Greek|&s;treet, could write of the court of England. The journey we have made from Belgrade hither, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be pa&s;&s;ed by any out of the public character. The de&s;ert woods of Servia, are the common refuge of thieves, who rob, fifty in a company, &s;o that we had need of all our guards to &s;ecure us; and the villages are &s;o poor, that only force could extort from them nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions. Indeed the Janizaries had no mercy on their poverty, killing all the poultry and &s;heep they could find, without a&s;king to whom they belonged; while the wretched owners dur&s;t not put in their claim for fear of being beaten. Lambs ju&s;t fallen, gee&s;e and turkies big with egg, all ma&s;|&s;acred without di&s;tinction! I fancied I heard the com|plaints of <HI>Melibeus,</HI> for the hope of his flock. When the Ba&s;&s;as travel, 'tis yet wor&s;e. Tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ors are not content, with eating all that is to be eaten belonging to the pea&s;ants; after they have crammed them&s;elves and their numerous retinue, they have the impudence to exact what they call <HI>Teeth money,</HI> a contribution for their u&s;e of their teeth, worn with doing them the honour of devouring their meat. This is literally and exactly true, however extrava|gant it may &s;eem; and &s;uch is the natural corruption of a military government, their religion not allowing of this barbarity, any more than ours does.</P>
<P>I had the advantage of lodging three weeks at Bel|grade, with a principal Effendi, that is to &s;ay, a &s;cholar. This &s;et of men are equally capable of pre|ferments in the law or the church; tho&s;e two &s;ciences being ca&s;t into one, and a lawyer and a prie&s;t being the &s;ame word in the Turki&s;h language. They are the only men really con&s;iderable in the Empire, all the profitable employments and church revenues
<PB N="75" REF="041644_0084_101AD22B8257FDA8">
are in their hands. The Grand Signior, though general heir to his people, never pre&s;umes to touch their lands or money, which go, in an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to their children. 'Tis true, they lo&s;e this privilege, by accepting a place at court, or the title of Ba&s;&s;a; but there are few examples of &s;uch fools among them. You may ea&s;ily judge of the power of the&s;e men, who have engro&s;&s;ed all the learning, and almo&s;t all the wealth of the Empire. 'Tis they that are the real authors, tho' the &s;oldiers are the actors, of revolutions. They depo&s;ed the late Sultan <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> and their power is &s;o well known, that 'tis the Emperor's intere&s;t to flatter them.</P>
<P>This is a long digre&s;&s;ion. I was going to tell you, that an intimate, daily conver&s;ation with the Effendi <HI>Achmet-beg,</HI> gave me an opportunity of knowing their religion and morals in a more particular manner than perhaps any Chri&s;tian ever did. I explained to him the difference between the religion of England and Rome; and he was plea&s;ed to hear there were Chri&s;|tians, that did not wor&s;hip images, or adore the Vir|gin <HI>Mary.</HI> The ridicule of <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation</HI> ap|peared very &s;trong to him.&mdash;Upon comparing our creeds together, I am convinced that if our friend Dr.&mdash;had free liberty of preaching here, it would be very ea&s;y to per&s;uade the generality to Chri&s;tianity, who&s;e notions are very little different from his. Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> would make a very good Apo&s;tle here. I don't doubt but his zeal will be much fired, if you communicate this account to him; but tell him, he mu&s;t fir&s;t have the gift of tongues, before he can po&s;&s;ibly be of any u&s;e.&mdash;Mahome|ti&s;m is divided into as many &s;ects as Chri&s;tianity, and the fir&s;t in&s;titution as much neglected, and ob&s;cured by interpretations. I cannot here forbear reflecting
<PB N="76" REF="041644_0085_101AD22DAFBBF498">
on the natural inclination of mankind, to make my&s;te|ries and novelties.&mdash;The <HI>Zeidi, Kudi, Jabari,</HI> &amp;c. put me in mind of the <HI>Catholics, Lutherans, and Cal|vini&s;ts,</HI> and are equally zealous again&s;t one another. But the mo&s;t prevailing opinion, if you &s;earch into the &s;ecret of the Effendi's, is plain Dei&s;m. This is indeed kept from the people, who are amu&s;ed with a thou&s;and different notions, according to the dif|ferent intere&s;t of their preachers.&mdash;There are very few among&s;t them (<HI>Achmet-beg</HI> denied there were any) &s;o ab&s;urd, as to &s;et up for wit, by declaring they believe no God at all. And Sir <HI>Paul Rycaut</HI> is mi&s;taken (as he commonly is) in calling the &s;ect <HI>Mute|rin</HI> (i. e. <HI>the &s;ecret with us</HI>) Athei&s;ts, they being Dei&s;ts, who&s;e impiety con&s;i&s;ts in making a je&s;t of their pro|phet. <HI>Achmet-beg</HI> did not own to me, that he was of this opinion, but made no &s;cruple of deviating from &s;ome part of Mahomet's law, by drinking wine with the &s;ame freedom we did. When I a&s;ked him how he came to allow him&s;elf that liberty; he made an&s;wer, That all the creatures of God are good, and de&s;igned for the u&s;e of man; however, that the pro|hibition of wine was a very wi&s;e maxim, and meant for the common people, being the &s;ource of all di&s;orders among&s;t them; but that the prophet never de&s;igned to confine tho&s;e that knew how to u&s;e it with moderation; neverthele&s;s, he &s;aid, that &s;candal ought to be avoided, and that he never drank it in public. This is the general way of thinking among&s;t them, and very few forbear drinking wine, that are able to afford it. He a&s;&s;ured me, that if I under&s;tood Arabic, I &s;hould be very well plea&s;ed with reading the Alcoran, which is &s;o far from the non&s;en&s;e we charge it with, that 'tis the pure&s;t morality, delivered in the very be&s;t language. I have &s;ince heard im|partial
<PB N="77" REF="041644_0086_101AD22F338CD6A0">
Chri&s;tians &s;peak of it in the &s;ame manner; and I don't doubt but that all our tran&s;lations are from copies got from the Greek prie&s;ts, who would not fail to fal&s;ify it with the extremity of malice. No body of men ever were more ignorant, or more corrupt; yet they differ &s;o little from the Romi&s;h Church, that, I confe&s;s, nothing gives me a greater abhorrence of the cruelty of your clergy, than the barbarous per&s;ecution of them, whenever they have been their ma&s;ters, for no other rea&s;on, than their not acknowledging the Pope. The di&s;&s;enting in that one article, has got them the titles of Heretics, and Schi&s;matis; and what is wor&s;e, the &s;ame treatment. I found at Phillippopolis, a &s;ect of Chri&s;tians that call them&s;elves <HI>Paulines.</HI> They &s;hew an old church where, they &s;ay, St. <HI>Paul</HI> preached, and he is their favourite Saint, after the &s;ame manner that St. <HI>Peter</HI> is at Rome; neither do they forget to give him the &s;ame preference over the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>But of all the religions I have &s;een, that of the <HI>Arnounts</HI> &s;eems to me the mo&s;t particular; they are natives of <HI>Arnountlich,</HI> the antient <HI>Macedonia,</HI> and &s;till retain the courage and hardine&s;s, tho' they have lo&s;t the name of Macedonians, being the be&s;t militia in the Turki&s;h Empire, and the only check upon the Janizaries. They are foot &s;oldiers; we had a guard of them, relieved in every con&s;iderable town we pa&s;|&s;ed; they are clothed and armed at their own ex|pence, dre&s;&s;ed in clean white coar&s;e cloth, carrying guns of a prodigious length, which they run with upon their &s;houlders, as if they did not feel the weight of them, the leader &s;inging a &s;ort of a rude tune, not unplea&s;ant, and the re&s;t making up the chorus. The&s;e people living between Chri&s;tians and Mahometans, and not being &s;killed in controver&s;y,
<PB N="78" REF="041644_0087_101AD2317B142928">
declare that they are utterly unable to judge which religion is be&s;t; but to be certain of not entirely rejecting the truth, they very prudently follow both. They go to the mo&s;ques on Fridays and to the church on Sunday, &s;aying for their excu&s;e, that at the day of judgment they are &s;ure of protection from the true prophet; but which that is, they are not able to determine in this world. I believe there is no other race of mankind, who have &s;o mode&s;t an opinion of their own capacity.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the remarks I have made, on the diver&s;ity of religions I have &s;een. I don't a&s;k your pardon for the liberty I have taken in &s;peaking of the Ro|man. I know you equally condemn the quackery of all churches, as much as you revere the &s;acred truths, in which we both agree.</P>
<P>You will expect I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething to you of the antiquities of this country, but there are few remains of antient Greece. We pa&s;&s;ed near the piece of an arch which is commonly called <HI>Trajan's gate,</HI> from a &s;uppo&s;ition that he made it to &s;hut up the pa&s;&s;age over the mountains, between Sophia and Phil|lippopolis. But I rather believe it the remains of &s;ome triumphal arch (though I could not &s;ee any in&s;cription;) for if that pa&s;&s;age had been &s;hut up, there are many others, that would &s;erve for the march of an army; and notwith&s;tanding the &s;tory of <HI>Baldwin</HI> Earl of Flanders, being overthrown in the&s;e &s;traits, after he won Con&s;tantinople, I don't fancy the Germans would find them&s;elves &s;topped by them at this day. 'Tis true, the road is now made (with great indu&s;try) as commodious as po&s;&s;ible, for the march of the Turki&s;h army; there is not one ditch or puddle between this place and Belgrade, that has not a large &s;trong bridge of planks built over it; but the preci|pices
<PB N="79" REF="041644_0088_101AD233A0BF4D00">
are not &s;o terrible as I had heard them repre&s;ent|ed. At the&s;e mountains, we lay at the little village Ki&s;|koi, wholly inhabited by Chri&s;tians, as all the pea|&s;ants of Bulgaria are. Their hou&s;es are nothing but little huts, rai&s;ed of dirt baked in the &s;un, and they leave them and fly into the mouutains, &s;ome months before the march of the Turki&s;h army, who would el&s;e entirely ruin them, by driving away their whole flocks. This precaution &s;ecures them in a &s;ort of plenty; for &s;uch va&s;t tracts of land lying in common, they have the liberty of &s;owing what they plea&s;e and are generally very indu&s;trious husbandmen. I drank here &s;everal &s;orts of delicious wine. The women dre&s;s them&s;elves in a great variety of coloured gla&s;s-beads, and are not ugly, but of tawney com|plexions. I have now told you all, that is worth telling you, and perhaps more, relating to my journey. When I am at Con&s;tantinople, I'll try to pick up &s;ome curio&s;ities, and then you &s;hall hear again from.</P>

The difference of the dre&s;s here and at London
<PB N="80" REF="041644_0089_101AD23676242B20">
is &s;o great, the &s;ame &s;ort of things are not proper for <HI>Caftans</HI> and <HI>Manteaus.</HI> However, I will not give over my &s;earch, but renew it again at Con&s;tantinople, though I have rea&s;on to believe there is nothing finer than what is to be found here, as this place is at pre&s;ent the re&s;idence of the court. The Grand Sig|nior's elde&s;t daughter was married &s;ome few days before I came hither, and upon that occa&s;ion the Turki&s;h Ladies di&s;play all their magnificence. The bride was conducted to her husband's hou&s;e in very great &s;plendor. She is widow of the late Vizier, who was killed at Peterwaradin, though that ought rather to be called a <HI>contract,</HI> than a <HI>marriage,</HI> &s;ince &s;he never has lived with him; however, the greate&s;t part of his wealth is hers. He had the permi&s;&s;ion of vi&s;iting her in the Seraglio; and being one of the hand&s;ome&s;t men in the empire, had very much en|gaged her affections.&mdash;When &s;he &s;aw this &s;econd husband, who is at lea&s;t fifty, &s;he could not forbear bur&s;ting into tears. He is indeed a man of merit, and the declared favourite of the Sultan, (which they call <HI>Mo&s;ayp</HI>) but that is not enough to make him plea|&s;ing in the eyes of a girl of thirteen.</P>
<P>The government here is entirely in the hands of the army. The Grand Signior, with all his ab&s;olute power, is as much a &s;lave as any of his &s;ubjects, and trembles at a Janizary's frown. Here is, indeed, a much greater appearance of &s;ubjection than among&s;t us; a mini&s;ter of &s;tate is not &s;poke to, but upon the knee; &s;hould a reflection on his conduct be dropt in a coffee hou&s;e, (for they have &s;pies every where) the hou&s;e would be raz'd to the ground, and perhaps the whole company put to the torture. No <HI>huzzaing mobs, &s;en&s;ele&s;s pamphlets, and tavern di&s;putes about politicks;</HI>

<L>A con&s;equential ill that freedom draws;</L>
<L>A bad effect,&mdash;but from a noble cau&s;e.</L></Q>
None of our harmle&s;s calling names! but when a mini&s;ter here di&s;plea&s;es the people, in three hours time he is dragged even from his ma&s;ter's arms. They cut off his hands, head and feet, and throw them before the palace-gate, with all the re&s;pect in the world; while the Sultan (to whom they all profe&s;s an unlimited adoration) &s;its trembling in his apart|ment, and dare neither defend nor revenge his favou|rite. This is the ble&s;&s;ed condition of the mo&s;t ab&s;o|lute monarch upon earth, who owns no <HI>Law</HI> but his <HI>Will.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot help wi&s;hing, in the loyalty of my heart, that the Parliament would &s;end hither a &s;hip load of your pa&s;&s;ive obedient men, that they might &s;ee arbitrary government in its cleare&s;t &s;tronge&s;t light, where 'tis hard to judge, whether the Prince, People or Mini&s;|ters, are mo&s;t mi&s;erable. I could make many reflec|tions on this &s;ubject; but I know, Madam, your own good &s;en&s;e, has already furni&s;hed you with better than I am capable of.</P>
<P>I went ye&s;terday along with the French Amba&s;&s;adre&s;s to &s;ee the Grand Signior in his pa&s;&s;age to the Mo&s;que. He was preceded by a numerous guard of Janizaries, with va&s;t white feathers on their heads, as al&s;o by the <HI>Spahis</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;tangees,</HI> (the&s;e are foot and hor&s;e guards) and the Royal Gardeners, which are a very con&s;ide|rable body of men, dre&s;&s;ed in different habits of fine lively colours, &s;o that, at a di&s;tance, they appeared like a parterre of tulips. After them the Aga of the Janizaries, in a robe of purple velvet, lined with &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ue, his hor&s;e led by two &s;laves richly dre&s;&s;ed. Next him the <HI>Kyzlier-Aga,</HI> (your lady&s;hip knows, this
<PB N="82" REF="041644_0091_101AD23A2D2BE378">
is the chief guardian of the Seraglio Ladies) in a deep yellow cloth (which &s;uited very well to his black face) lined with &s;ables. La&s;t came his <HI>Sublimity</HI> him&s;elf, arrayed in green, lined with the fur of a black Mu&s;|covite fox, which is &s;uppo&s;ed worth a thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, and mounted on a fine hor&s;e, with furniture embroidered with jewels. Six more hor&s;es richly capari&s;oned were led after him; and two of his principal courtiers bore, one his gold, and the other his &s;ilver coffee-pot, on a &s;taff; another carried a &s;ilver &s;tool on his head, for him to &s;it on.&mdash;It would be too tedious to tell your lady&s;hip, the various dre&s;&s;es and turbants by which their rank is di&s;tingui&s;hed; but they are all extremely rich and gay, to the number of &s;ome thou&s;ands; &s;o that perhaps there cannot be &s;een a more beautiful proce&s;&s;ion. The Sultan appeared to us a hand&s;ome man of about forty, with &s;omething, however, &s;evere in his countenance, and his eyes very full and black. He happened to &s;top under the win|dow where we &s;tood, and (I &s;uppo&s;e being told who we were) looked upon us very attentively, &s;o that we had full lei&s;ure to con&s;ider him. The French Amba&s;&s;adre&s;s agreed with me as to his good mien. I &s;ee that lady very often; &s;he is young, and her con|ver&s;ation would be a great relief to me, if I could per&s;uade her to live without tho&s;e forms and cere|monies that make life formal and tire&s;ome. But &s;he is &s;o delighted with her guards, her four and twenty footmen, gentlemen-u&s;hers, &amp;c. that &s;he would rather die than make me a vi&s;it without them; not to reckon a coachful of attending dam&s;els yolep'd maids of ho|nour. What vexes me is that as long as &s;he will vi&s;it me with a trouble&s;ome equipage, I am obliged to do the &s;ame; however, our mutual intere&s;t makes us much together. I went with her the other day all
<PB N="83" REF="041644_0092_101AD23BF1F55E20">
round the town, in an open gilt chariot, with our joint train of attendants, preceded by our guards, who might have &s;ummoned the people to &s;ee what they had never &s;een, nor ever perhaps would &s;ee again, two young Chri&s;tian Amba&s;&s;adre&s;&s;es at the &s;ame time. Your lady&s;hip may ea&s;ily imagine, we drew a va&s;t croud of &s;pectators, but all &s;ilent as death. If any of them had taken the liberties of our mobs upon any &s;trange &s;ight, our Janizaries had made no &s;cruple of falling on them with their &s;cymitars, with|out danger for &s;o doing, being above law. The&s;e people however (I mean the Janizaries) have &s;ome good qualities; they are very zealous and faithful where they &s;erve, and look upon it as their bu&s;ine&s;s to fight for you on all occa&s;ions. Of this I had a very plea&s;ant in&s;tance in a village on this &s;ide Phil|lippopolis, where we were met by our dome&s;tic guards. I happened to be&s;peak pigeons for &s;upper, upon which one of my Janizaries went immediately to the <HI>Cadi</HI> (the chief civil officer of the town) and ordered him to &s;end in &s;ome dozen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. The poor man an&s;wered, that he had already &s;ent about, but could get none, My Janizary, in the height of his zeal for my &s;er|vice, immediately locked him up pri&s;oner in his room, telling him he de&s;erved death for his impudence, in offering to excu&s;e his not obeying my command; but, out of re&s;pect to me, he would not puni&s;h him but by my order. Accordingly he came very gravely to me, to a&s;k what &s;hould be done to him; adding, by way of compliment, that if I plea&s;ed he would bring me his head.&mdash;This may give you &s;ome idea of the unlimited power of the&s;e fellows, who are all &s;worn brothers, and bound to revenge the injuries done to one another, whether at Cairo, Aleppo, or any part of the world.

<P>I WISH to God, dear &s;i&s;ter, that you were as regular in letting me know what pa&s;&s;es on your &s;ide of the globe, as I am careful in endeavouring to amu&s;e you by the account of all I &s;ee here, that I think worth your notice, You content your&s;elf with telling me over and over, that the town is very dull; it may, po&s;&s;ibly, be dull to you, when every day does not pre&s;ent you with &s;omething new; but for me, that am in arrears, at lea&s;t two months news, all that &s;eems very &s;tale with you, would be very fre&s;h and &s;weet here. Pray let me into more particulars, and I will try to awaken your gratitude, by giving you a full and true relation of the novelties of this place, none of which would &s;urpri&s;e you more than a &s;ight

of my per&s;on, as I am now in my Turki&s;h habit, though I believe you would be of my opinion, that 'tis admirably becoming.&mdash;I intend to &s;end you my picture; in the mean time accept of it here.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of my dre&s;s is a pair of drawers, very full, that reach to my &s;hoes, and conceal the legs more mode&s;tly than your petticoats. They are of a thin ro&s;e coloured dama&s;k, brocaded with &s;ilver flowers. My &s;hoes are of white kid leather, embroidered with gold. Over this hangs my &s;mock, of a fine white &s;ilk gauze, edged with embroidery. This &s;mock has wide &s;leeves, hanging half-way down the arm, and is clo&s;ed at the neck with a diamond button; but the &s;hape and colour of the bo&s;om is very well to be di&s;tingui&s;hed through it.&mdash;The <HI>Antery</HI> is a wai&s;t|coat, made clo&s;e to the &s;hape, of white and gold da|ma&s;k, with very long &s;leeves falling back, and fringed with deep gold fringe, and &s;hould have diamond or pearl buttons. My <HI>Caftan,</HI> of the &s;ame &s;tuff with my drawers, is a robe exactly fitted to my &s;hape and reaching to my feet, with very long &s;trait falling &s;leeves. Over this is the girdle, of about four fin|gers broad, which all that can afford it, have entirely of diamonds or other precious &s;tones; tho&s;e, who will not be at that expence, have it of exqui&s;ite em|broidery on &s;attin; but it mu&s;t be faftened before with a cla&s;p of diamonds.&mdash;The <HI>Curdee</HI> is a loo&s;e robe they throw off, or put on, according to the wea|ther, being of a rich brocade (mine, is green and gold) either lined with ermine or &s;ables; the &s;leeves reach very little below the &s;houlders. The head-dre&s;s is compo&s;ed of a cap, called <HI>Talpock,</HI> which is, in winter, of fine velvet embroidered with pearls or dia|monds, and, in &s;ummer, of a light &s;hining &s;ilver &s;tuff. This is fixed on one &s;ide of the head, hanging a little
<PB N="86" REF="041644_0095_101AD2434FBE1B08">
way down with a gold ta&s;&s;el, and bound on, either with a circle of diamonds (as I have &s;een &s;everal) or a rich embroidered handkerchief. On the other &s;ide of the head, the hair is laid flat; and here the ladies are at liberty to &s;hew their fancies; &s;ome putting flowers, others a plume of heron's feathers, and, in &s;hort, what they plea&s;e; but the mo&s;t general fa&s;hion is, a large <HI>Bouquet</HI> of jewels, made like natural flowers, that is, the <HI>buds</HI> of pearl; the <HI>ro&s;es</HI> of different coloured rubies; the <HI>je&s;&s;amines</HI> of diamonds; the <HI>jonquils</HI> of topazes, &amp;c. &s;o well &s;et and enamelled, 'tis hard to imagine any thing of that kind &s;o beautiful. The hair hangs at its full length behind, divided into tre&s;&s;es braided with pearl or ribbon, which is always in great quantity. I never &s;aw in my life, &s;o many fine heads of hair. In one lady's I have counted a hundred and ten of the tre&s;&s;es, all natural; but it mu&s;t be owned that every kind of beauty is more common here than with us. 'Tis &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee a young woman that is not very hand&s;ome. They have naturally the mo&s;t beautiful complexions in the world, and generally large black eyes. I can a&s;&s;ure you with great truth, that the court of England (though I believe it the faire&s;t in Chri&s;tendom) does not contain &s;o many beauties as are under our pro|tection here. They generally &s;hape their eye-brows, and both Greeks and Turks have the cu&s;tom of put|ting round their eyes a black tincture, that, at di&s;tance, or by candle light, adds very much to the blackne&s;s of them. I fancy many of our ladies would be over|joyed to know this &s;ecret; but 'tis too vi&s;ible by day. They dye their nails a ro&s;e-colour; but I own, I cannot enough accu&s;tom my&s;elf to this fa&s;hion, to find any beauty in it.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="041644_0096_101AD24573416238">
As to their morality or good conduct, I can &s;ay, like Harlequin, that 'tis ju&s;t as 'tis with you; and the Turki&s;h ladies don't commit one &s;in the le&s;s for not being Chri&s;tians. Now that I am a little ac|quainted with their ways, I cannot forbear admiring, either the exemplary di&s;cretion, or extreme &s;tupidity of all the writers that have given accounts of them. 'Tis very ea&s;y to &s;ee, they have in reality more liberty than we have. No woman, of what rank &s;oever, is permitted to go into the &s;treets without two <HI>Murlins,</HI> one that covers her face, all but her eyes; and ano|ther, that hides the whole dre&s;s of her head, and hangs half way down her back. Their &s;hapes are al&s;o wholly concealed, by a thing they call a <HI>Ferigee,</HI> which no woman of any &s;ort appears without; this has &s;trait &s;leeves, that reach to their fingers ends, and it laps all round them, not unlike a riding-hood. In winter, 'tis of cloth; and in &s;ummer, of plain &s;tuff or &s;ilk. You may gue&s;s then, how effectually this di&s;gui&s;es them, &s;o that there is no di&s;tingui&s;hing the great lady from her &s;lave. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t jealous husband to know his wife, when he meets her, and no man dare touch or follow a woman in the &s;treet.</P>
<P>This perpetual ma&s;querade gives them entire liberty of following their inclinations without danger of di&s;|covery. The mo&s;t u&s;ual method of intrigue is, to &s;end an appointment to the lover to meet the lady at a Jew's &s;hop, which are as notoriou&s;ly convenient as our Indian-hou&s;es; and yet, even tho&s;e who don't make u&s;e of them, do not &s;cruple to go to buy penny|worths, and tumble over rich goods, which are chiefly to be found among&s;t that &s;ort of people. The great ladies &s;eldom let their gallants know who they are; and 'tis &s;o difficult to find it out, that they can very
<PB N="88" REF="041644_0097_101AD2487408DCA0">
&s;eldom gue&s;s at her name, whom they have corre&s;|ponded with for above half a year together. You may ea&s;ily imagine the number of faithful wives very &s;mall in a country where they have nothing to fear from a lover's indi&s;cretion, &s;ince we &s;ee &s;o many have the courage to expo&s;e them&s;elves to that in this world, and all the threatened puni&s;hment of the next, which is never preached to the Turki&s;h dam&s;els. Neither have they much to apprehend from the re|&s;entment of their husbands: tho&s;e ladies that are rich, having all their money in their own hands. Upon the whole, I look upon the Turki&s;h women, as the only free people in the Empire; the very Divan pays a re&s;pect to them, and the Grand Signior him|&s;elf, when a <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> is executed, never violates the pri|vileges of the <HI>Haram,</HI> (or womens apartment) which re|mains un&s;earched and entire to the widow. They are Queens of their &s;laves, whom the husband has no permi&s;&s;ion &s;o much as to look upon, except it be an old woman or two that his lady choo&s;es. 'Tis true, their law permits them four wives, but there is no in&s;tance of a man of quality that makes u&s;e of this liberty, or of a woman of rank that would &s;uffer it. When a husband happens to be incon&s;tant (as tho&s;e things will happen) he keeps his mi&s;tre&s;s in a hou&s;e apart, and vi&s;its her as privately as he can, ju&s;t as 'tis with you. Among&s;t all the great men here, I only know the <HI>Tefterdar</HI> (i. e. Trea&s;ure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">) that keeps a number of &s;he-&s;laves, for his own u&s;e, (that is, on his own &s;ide of the hou&s;e, for a &s;lave once given to &s;erve a lady, is entirely at her di&s;po&s;al) and he is &s;poke of as a libertine, or what we &s;hould call a rake; and his wife won't &s;ee him, though &s;he continues to live in his hou&s;e. Thus you &s;ee, dear &s;i&s;ter, the manners of mankind do not differ &s;o widely, as our
<PB N="89" REF="041644_0098_101AD249F61D31F8">
voyage writers would make us believe. Perhaps, it would be more entertaining to add a few &s;urpri&s;ing cu&s;toms of my own invention; but nothing &s;eems to me &s;o agreeable as truth, and I believe nothing &s;o acceptable to you. I conclude therefore, with re|peating the great truth of my being,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Adrianople,</HI> <DATE>April 1,</DATE> O. S.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I DARE &s;ay you expect, at lea&s;t, &s;omething very new in this letter, after I have gone a journey, not undertaken, by any Chri&s;tian, for &s;ome hundred years. The mo&s;t remarkable accident that happened to me, was my being very near over-turned into the Hebrus; and, if I had much regard for the glories that one's name enjoys after death, I &s;hould certainly be &s;orry for having mi&s;&s;ed the romantic conclu&s;ion of &s;wimming down the &s;ame river in which the mu&s;i|cal head of <HI>Orpheus</HI> repeated ver&s;es, &s;o many ages &s;ince:
<Q><L><HI>Caput a cervice revul&s;um,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Gurgite cum medio, portans Oeagrius Hebrus</HI></L>
<L><HI>Volveret, Euridicen vox ip&s;a, et frigida lingua</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ah! mi&s;eram Euridicen! anima fugiente vocabat,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Euridicen toto referebant flumine ripae.</HI></L></Q>
Who knows but &s;ome of your bright wits, might have found it a &s;ubject affording many poetical turns, and have told the world, in an heroic Elegy, that,
<Q><HI>As equal were our &s;ouls, &s;o equal were our fates.</HI></Q>
<PB N="90" REF="041644_0099_101AD24C429554C8">
I de&s;pair of ever hearing &s;o many fine things &s;aid of me, as &s;o extraordinary a death would have given occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>I am at this pre&s;ent moment writing in a hou&s;e &s;ituated on the banks of the Hebrus, which runs under my chamber window. My garden is full of tall cypre&s;s trees, upon the branches of which, &s;everal couple of true turtles are &s;aying &s;oft things to one an other from morning till night. How naturally do <HI>boughs</HI> and <HI>vows</HI> come into my mind, at this minute? And mu&s;t not you confe&s;s, to my prai&s;e, that 'tis more than an ordinary di&s;cretion, that can re&s;i&s;t the wicked &s;ugge&s;tions of poetry in a place where truth, for once, furni&s;hes all the ideas of pa&s;|toral. The &s;ummer is already far advanced, in this part of the world; and for &s;ome miles round Adria|anople, the whole ground is laid out in gardens, and the banks of the rivers are &s;et with rows of fruit trees, under which all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Turks divert them&s;elves every evening, not with walking, that is not one of their plea&s;ures; but a &s;et party of them choo&s;e out a green &s;pot, where the &s;hade is very thick, and there they &s;pread a carpet, on which they &s;it drinking their coffee, and are generally attended by &s;ome &s;lave with a fine voice, or that plays on &s;ome in&s;trument. Every twenty paces you may &s;ee one of the&s;e little companies, li&s;tening to the da&s;hing of the river; and this ta&s;te is &s;o univer&s;al, that the very gardeners are not without it. I have often &s;een them and their children &s;itting on the banks of the river, and playing on a rural in&s;trument, perfectly an&s;wer|ing the de&s;cription of the ancient <HI>Fi&s;tula,</HI> being com|po&s;ed of unequal reeds, with a &s;imple but agreeable &s;oftne&s;s in the &s;ound.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="041644_0100_101AD24F091A75A8">
Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> might here make the experiment he &s;peaks of in his travels; there not being one in&s;tru|ment of mu&s;ic among the Greek or Roman Statues, that is not to be found in the hands of the people of this country. The young lads generally divert them|&s;elves with making garlands for their favourite lambs, which I have often &s;een painted and adorned with flowers, lying at their feet, while they &s;ung or played. It is not that they ever read Romances. But the&s;e are the ancient amu&s;ements here, and as natural to them as cudgel-playing and foot-ball to our Briti&s;h &s;wains; the &s;oftne&s;s and warmth of the climate for|bidding all rough exerci&s;es, which were never &s;o much as heard of among&s;t them, and naturally in&s;pi|ring a lazine&s;s and aver&s;ion to labour, which the great plenty indulges. The&s;e gardeners are the only happy race of country people in Turkey. They furni&s;h all the city with fruits and herbs, and &s;eem to live very ea&s;ily. They are mo&s;t of them Greeks, and have little hou&s;es in the mid&s;t of their gardens, where their wives and daughters, take a liberty, not per|mitted in the town, I mean to go unveiled. The&s;e wenches are very neat and hand&s;ome, and pa&s;s their time at their looms under the &s;hade of the trees.</P>
<P>I no longer look upon <HI>Theocritus</HI> as a romantic wri|ter; he has only given a plain image of the way of life among&s;t the pea&s;ants of his country; who, before oppre&s;&s;ion had reduced them to want, were, I &s;up|po&s;e, all employed as the better &s;ort of them are now. I don't doubt had he been born a Briton, but his <HI>Idylliums</HI> had been filled with de&s;criptions of thre&s;hing and churning, both which are unknown here, the corn being all trod out by oxen; and but|ter (I &s;peak it with &s;orrow) unheard of.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="041644_0101_101AD2513AC29A40">
I read over your <HI>Homer</HI> here, with an infinite plea|&s;ure, and find &s;everal little pa&s;&s;ages explained, that I did not before entirely comprehend the beauty of: Many of the cu&s;toms, and much of the dre&s;s then in fa&s;hion, being yet retained. I don't wonder to find more remains here, of an age &s;o di&s;tant, than is to be found in any other country, the Turks not taking that pains to introduce their own manners, as has been generally practi&s;ed by other nations, that ima|gine them&s;elves more polite. It would be too tedi|ous to you to point out all the pa&s;&s;ages that relate to pre&s;ent cu&s;toms. But I can a&s;&s;ure you, that the Prince&s;&s;es and great ladies pa&s;s their time at their looms, embroidering veils and robes, &s;urrounded by their maids, which are always very numerous, in the &s;ame manner as we find <HI>Andromache</HI> and <HI>Helen</HI> de&s;cri|bed. The de&s;cription of the belt of <HI>Menelaus,</HI> exactly re&s;embles tho&s;e that are now worn by the great men, fa&s;tened before with broad golden cla&s;ps, and embroi|dered round with rich work. The &s;nowy veil, that <HI>Helen</HI> throws over her face, is &s;till fa&s;hionable; and I never &s;ee half a dozen of old Ba&s;haws (as I do very often) with their reverend beards, &s;itting ba&s;king in the &s;un, but I recollect good King <HI>Priam</HI> and his coun&s;ellors. Their manner of dancing is certainly the &s;ame that <HI>Diana</HI> is <HI>&s;ung</HI> to have danced on the banks of <HI>Eurotas.</HI> The great lady &s;till leads the dance, and is followed by a troop of young girls, who imitate her &s;teps, and, if &s;he &s;ings, make up the chorus. The tunes are extremely gay and lively, yet with &s;omething in them wonderfully &s;oft. The &s;teps are varied according to the plea&s;ure of her that leads the dance, but always in exact time, and infi|nitely more agreeable than any of our dances, at lea&s;t in my opinion. I &s;ometimes make one in the train,
<PB N="93" REF="041644_0102_101AD252C3D00B30">
but am not &s;kilful enough to lead; the&s;e are the Grecian dances, the Turki&s;h being very different.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have told you, in the fir&s;t place, that the Ea&s;tern manners give a great light into many Scrip|ture pa&s;&s;ages that appear odd to us, their phra&s;es being commonly what we &s;hould call Scripture lan|guage. The vulgar Turk is very different from what is &s;poke at court, or among&s;t the people of figure; who always mix &s;o much Arabic and Per&s;ian in their di&s;cour&s;e, that it may very well be called another language. And 'tis as ridiculous to make u&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ions commonly u&s;ed, in &s;peaking to a great man or lady, as it would be to &s;peak broad York&s;hire, or Somer&s;et&s;hire, in the drawing-room. Be&s;ides this de&s;tinction, they have what they call, the <HI>&s;ublime,</HI> that is, a &s;tyle proper for poetry, and which is the exact Scripture &s;tyle. I believe you would be plea&s;ed to &s;ee a genuine example of this; and I am very glad I have it in my power to &s;atisfy your curi|o&s;ity, by &s;ending you a faithful copy of the ver&s;es that <HI>Ibraim Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> the reigning favourite, has made for the young Prince&s;s, his contracted Wife, whom he is not yet permitted to vi&s;it without witne&s;&s;es though &s;he is gone home to his hou&s;e. He is a man of wit and learning; and whether or no he is capable of writing good ver&s;e, you may be &s;ure, that on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, he would not want the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the be&s;t poets in the Empire. Thus the ver&s;es may be looked upon as a &s;ample of their fine&s;t poetry; and I don't doubt you'll be of my mind, that it is mo&s;t wonderfully re&s;embling the <HI>Song of Solomon,</HI> which al&s;o was addre&s;&s;ed to a Royal Bride.</P>

<P>I have taken abundance of pains to get the&s;e ver&s;es in a literal tran&s;lation; and if you were acquainted with my interpreters, I might &s;pare my&s;elf the trou|ble of a&s;&s;uring you, that they have received no poe|tical touches from their hands. In my opinion, (allowing for the inevitable faults of a pro&s;e tran&s;la|tion into a language &s;o very different) there is a good deal of beauty in them. The epithet of <HI>&s;tag-ey'd</HI> (though the &s;ound is not very agreeable in Engli&s;h) plea&s;es me extremely; and I think it a very lively image of the fire and indifference in his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es eyes.&mdash;Mon&s;ieur <HI>Boileau</HI> has very ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that we are never to judge of the elevation of an expre&s;&s;ion in an antient author, by the &s;ound it car|ries with us; &s;ince it may be extremely fine with them, when, at the &s;ame time, it appeals low or uncouth to us. You are &s;o well acquainted with <HI>Homer,</HI> you cannot but have ob&s;erved the &s;ame thing, and you mu&s;t have the &s;ame indulgence for all ori|ental poetry.

<HEAD>To Mrs. S. C.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Adrianople, <DATE>April 1,</DATE> O. S.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN my opinion, dear S. I ought rather to quarrel with you, for not an&s;wering my Nimeguen letter of Augu&s;t, till December, than to excu&s;e my not wri|ing again till now. I am &s;ure there is on my &s;ide a very good excu&s;e for &s;ilence, having gone &s;uch tire|&s;ome land-journies, though I don't find the conclu&s;ion of them &s;o bad as you &s;eem to imagine. I am very ea&s;y here, and not in the &s;olitude you fancy me. The great number of Greeks, French, Engli&s;h and Italians, that are under our protection, make their court to me from morning till night; and I'll a&s;&s;ure you, are, many of them, very fine ladies; for there is no po&s;&s;ibility for a Chri&s;tian to live ea&s;ily under this government, but by the protection of an Amba&s;|&s;ador&mdash;and the richer they are, the greater is their danger.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e dreadful &s;tories you have heard of the <HI>Plague,</HI> have very little foundation in truth. I own, I have much ado to reconcile my&s;elf to the &s;ound of a word, which has always given me &s;uch terrible ideas; though I am convinced there is little more in it, than a fever. As a proof this, let me tell you, that we pa&s;&s;ed through two or three towns mo&s;t vio|lently infected. In the very next hou&s;e where we lay, (in one of tho&s;e places) two per&s;ons died of it. Luckily for me, I was &s;o well deceived, that I knew
<PB N="99" REF="041644_0108_101AD2612A3C1A70">
nothing of the matter; and I was made believe, that our &s;econd cook had only a great cold. However, we left our doctor to take care of him, and ye&s;terday they both arrived here in good health; and I am now let into the &s;ecret, that he has had the <HI>Plague.</HI> There are many that e&s;cape it, neither is the air ever infected. I am per&s;uaded that it would be as ea&s;y a matter to root it out here, as out of Italy and France; but it does &s;o little mi&s;chief they are not very &s;olicitous about it, and are content to &s;uffer this di&s;temper, in&s;tead of our variety, which they are utterly unacquainted with.</P>
<P>A <HI>propos</HI> of di&s;tempers, I am going to tell you a thing, that will make you wi&s;h your&s;elf here. The <HI>&s;mall-pox,</HI> &s;o fatal, and &s;o general among&s;t us, is here entirely harmle&s;s, by the invention of <HI>engrafting,</HI> which is the term they give it. There is a &s;et of old women, who make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to perform the operation, every autumn, in the month of Sep|tember, when the great heat is abated. People &s;end to one another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the &s;mall-pox; they make parties for this purpo&s;e, and when they are met (commonly fif|teen or &s;ixteen together) the old women comes with a nut-&s;hell full of the matter of the be&s;t &s;ort of &s;mall|pox, and a&s;ks what veins you plea&s;e to have opened. She immediately rips open that, you offer to her, with a large needle (which gives you no more pain than a common &s;cratch) and puts into the vein, as much matter as can lie upon the head of her needle, and after that, binds up the little wound with a hol|low bit of &s;hell, and in this manner opens four or five veins. The Grecians have commonly the &s;uper|&s;tition of opening one in the middle of the forehead, one in each arm, and one on the brea&s;t, to mark the
<PB N="100" REF="041644_0109_101AD26361A7A190">
&s;ign of the cro&s;s; but this has a very ill effect, all the&s;e wounds leaving little &s;cars, and is not done by tho&s;e that are not &s;uper&s;titious, who choo&s;e to have them in the legs, or that part of the arm that is concealed. The children or young patients play together all the re&s;t of the day, and are in perfect health to the eighth. Then the fever begins to &s;eize them, and they keep their beds two days, very &s;el|dom three. They have very rarely above twenty or thirty in their faces, which never mark, and in eight days time they are as well as before their ill|ne&s;s. Where they are wounded, there remains run|ning &s;ores during the di&s;temper, which I don't doubt is a great relief to it. Every year thou&s;ands undergo this operation, and the French Amba&s;&s;ador &s;ays plea|&s;antly, that they take the &s;mall-pox here by way of diver&s;ion, as they take the waters in others countries. There is no example of any one that has died in it, and you may believe I am well &s;atisfied of the &s;afety of this experiment, &s;ince I intend to try it on my dear little &s;on. I am patriot enough to take pains to bring this u&s;eful invention into fa&s;hion in England, and I &s;hould not fail to write to &s;ome of our Doctors very particularly about it, if I knew any one of them that I thought had virtue enough to de&s;troy &s;uch a con&s;iderable branch of their revenue, for the good of mankind. But that de&s;temper is too beneficial to them, not to expo&s;e to all their re&s;entment, the hardy wight that &s;hould undertake to put an end to it. Perhaps, if I live to return, I may, however, have courage to war with them. Upon this occa&s;ion, admire the heroi&s;m in the heart of,</P>

<HEAD>To Mrs. T.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Adrianople, <DATE>April 1,</DATE> O. S. 1718.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN now tell dear Mrs. T&mdash;, that I am &s;afely arrived at the end of my very long journey. I will not tire you with the account of the many fatigues I have &s;uffered. You would rather be in|formed of the &s;trange things that are to be &s;een here; and a letter out of Turkey, that has nothing extra|ordinary in it, would be as great a di&s;appointment as my vi&s;itors will receive at London, if I return thither without any rarities to &s;hew them.&mdash;What &s;hall I tell you of?&mdash;You never &s;aw camels in your life; and perhaps the de&s;cription of them will appear new to you; I can a&s;&s;ure you, the fir&s;t &s;ight of them was &s;o to me; and though I have &s;een hundreds of pic|tures of tho&s;e animals, I never &s;aw any that was re&s;embling enough, to give a true idea of them. I am going to make a bold ob&s;ervation, and po&s;&s;ibly a fal&s;e one, becau&s;e no body has ever made it before me; but I do take them to be of the &s;tag-kind; their legs, bodies, and necks, are exactly &s;haped like them, and their colour very near the &s;ame. 'Tis true, they are much larger, being a great deal higher than a hor&s;e, and &s;o &s;wift, that, after the defeat of Pete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> waradin, they far out-ran the &s;wifte&s;t hor&s;es, and brought the fir&s;t news of the lo&s;s of the battle to Belgrade. They are never thoroughly tamed; the drivers take care to tye them one to another with
<PB N="102" REF="041644_0111_101AD267070159A8">
&s;trong ropes, fifty in a &s;tring, led by an a&s;s, on which the driver rides. I have &s;een three hundred in one caravan. They carry the third part more than any hor&s;e: but 'tis a particular art to load them, becau&s;e of the bunch on their backs. They &s;eem to me very ugly creatures, their heads being ill formed and di&s;proportioned to their bodies. They carry all the burdens; and the bea&s;ts de&s;tined to the plough are buffaloes, and animal you are al&s;o unacquainted with. They are larger and more clum&s;y than an ox; they have &s;hort thick black horns clo&s;e to their heads, which grow turning backwards. They &s;ay this horn looks very beautiful when 'tis well poli&s;hed. They are all black, with very &s;hort hair on their hides, and have extremely little white eyes, that makes them look like devils. The country people dye their tails, and the hair of their forehead red, by way of orna|ment. Hor&s;es are not put here to any laborious work, nor are they at all fit for it. They are beau|tiful and full of &s;pirit, but generally little, and not &s;trong, as the breed of colder countries; very gentle, however, with all their vivacity, and al&s;o &s;wift and &s;ure-footed. I have a little white favourite, that I would not part with on any terms; he prances under me with &s;o much fire, you would think that I had a great deal of courage to dare mount him; yet I'll a&s;&s;ure you, I never rid a hor&s;e &s;o much at my com|mand, in my life. My &s;ide-&s;addle is the fir&s;t that was ever &s;een in this part of the world, and is gazed at with as much wonder, as the &s;hip of Columbus in the fir&s;t di&s;covery of America. Here are &s;ome little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rds, held in a &s;ort of religious reverence, and for that rea&s;on multiply prodigiou&s;ly; <HI>Turtles,</HI> on the account of their innocence; and <HI>Storcks</HI> becau&s;e they are &s;uppo&s;ed to make every winter the pilgrimage
<PB N="103" REF="041644_0112_101AD269DA96F608">
to Mecca. To &s;ay truth, they are the happie&s;t &s;ub|jects under the Turki&s;h government, and are &s;o &s;en|&s;ible of their privileges, that they walk the &s;treets without fear, and generally build in the low parts of hou&s;es. Happy are tho&s;e who&s;e hou&s;es are &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, as the vulgar Turks are perfectly per|&s;uaded, that they will not be, that year, attacked either by fire or pe&s;tilence. I have the happine&s;s of one of their &s;acred ne&s;ts under my chamber-window.</P>
<P>Now I am talking of my chamber, I remember, the de&s;cription of the hou&s;es here will be as new to you, as any of the birds or bea&s;ts. I &s;uppo&s;e you have read in mo&s;t of our accounts of Turkey, that their hou&s;es are the mo&s;t mi&s;erable pieces of building in the world. I can &s;peak very learnedly on that &s;ubject, having been in &s;o many of them; and I a&s;&s;ure you, 'tis no &s;uch thing. We are now lodged in a palace, belonging to the Grand Signior. I really think the manner of building here very agreeable, and proper for the country. 'Tis true, they are not at all &s;olicitous to beautify the out&s;ides of their hou&s;es, and they are generally built of wood, which, I own, is the cau&s;e of many inconveniencies; but this is not to be charged on the ill ta&s;te of the people, but on the oppre&s;&s;ion of the government. Every hou&s;e, at the death of its ma&s;ter, is at the Grand Signior's di&s;po&s;al, and therefore no man cares to make a great expence, which he is not &s;ure his family will be the better for. All their de&s;ign is to build a hou&s;e commodious, and that will la&s;t their lives; and they are very indif|ferent if it falls down the year after. Every hou&s;e, great and &s;mall, is divided into two di&s;tinct parts, which only join together by a narrow pa&s;&s;age. The fir&s;t hou&s;e has a large court before it, and open gal|leries all round it, which is, to me, a thing very
<PB N="104" REF="041644_0113_101AD26C174FFCB0">
agreeable. This gallery leads to all the chambers, which are commonly large, and with two rows of windows, the fir&s;t being of painted gla&s;s; they &s;el|dom build above two &s;tories, each of which has gal|leries. The &s;tairs are broad, and not often above thirty &s;teps. This is the hou&s;e belonging to the lord, and the adjoining one is called the <HI>Haram,</HI> that is, the ladies apartment, (for the name of Seraglio is peculiar to the Grand Signior) it has al&s;o a gallery running round it towards the garden, to which all the windows are turned, and the &s;ame number of chambers as the other, but more gay and &s;plendid, both in painting and furniture. The &s;econd row of windows are very low, with grates like tho&s;e of con|vents, the rooms are all &s;pread with Per&s;ian carpets, and rai&s;ed at one end of them (my chambers are rai&s;ed at both ends) about two foot. This is the <HI>Sopha,</HI> which is laid with a richer &s;ort of carpet, and all round it a &s;ort of couch rai&s;ed half a foot, covered with rich &s;ilk, according to the fancy or mag|nificence of the owner. Mine is of &s;carlet cloth with a gold fringe; round about this are placed, &s;tanding again&s;t the wall, two rows of cu&s;hions, the fir&s;t very large, and the next little ones; and here the Turks di&s;play their greate&s;t magnificence. They are ge|nerally brocade, or embroidery of gold wire upon white sattin&mdash;Nothing can look more gay and &s;plen|did.&mdash;The&s;e &s;eats are al&s;o &s;o convenient and ea&s;y, that I believe I &s;hall never endure chairs as long as I live.&mdash;The rooms are low which I think no fault, and the ceiling is always of wood, generally inlaid or painted with flowers. They open in many places, with folding-doors, and &s;erve for cabinets, I think more conveniently than ours. Between the windows are little arches to &s;et pots of perfume or
<PB N="105" REF="041644_0114_101ABF98AA867980">
ba&s;kets of flowers. But what plea&s;es me be&s;t, is the fa&s;hion of having marble fountains in the lower part of the room, which throw up &s;everal &s;pouts of water, giving, at the &s;ame time, an agreeable coolne&s;s, and a plea&s;ant da&s;hing &s;ound, falling from one ba&s;on to another. Some of the&s;e are very magnificent. Each hou&s;e has a bagnio, which con&s;i&s;ts generally in two or three little rooms leaded on the top, paved with marble, with ba&s;ons, cocks of water, and all conve|niencies for either hot or cold baths.</P>
<P>You will perhaps be &s;urpri&s;ed at an account &s;o different from what you have been entertained with by the common voyage-writers, who are very fond of &s;peaking of what they don't know. It mu&s;t be under a very particular character, or on &s;ome extraordi|nary occa&s;ion, that a Chri&s;tian is admitted into the hou&s;e of a man of quality, and their <HI>Harams</HI> are always forbidden ground. Thus they can only &s;peak of the out&s;ide, which makes no great appearance; and the womens apartments are always built back|ward, removed from &s;ight, and have no other pro&s;|pect than the gardens, which are inclo&s;ed with very high walls. There is none of our parterres in them; but they are planted with high trees, which give an agreeable &s;hade, and, to my fancy, a plea&s;ing view. In the mid&s;t of the garden is the <HI>Chio&s;k,</HI> that is, a large room, commonly beautified with a fine foun|tain in the mid&s;t of it. It is rai&s;ed nine or ten &s;teps, and enclo&s;ed with gilded lattices, round which, vines, je&s;&s;amines, and honey-&s;uckles, make a &s;ort of green wall. Large trees are planted round this place, which is the &s;cene of their greate&s;t plea&s;ures, and where the ladies &s;pend mo&s;t of their hours, employed by their mu&s;ick or embroidery.&mdash;In the public gardens, there are public <HI>Chio&s;ks,</HI> where people go, that are not &s;o
<PB N="106" REF="041644_0115_101AD26F2EB27BA8">
well accommodated at home, and drink their coffee, &s;herbet, &amp;c. Neither are they ignorant of a more durable manner of building; their Mo&s;ques are all of free &s;tone, and the public <HI>Hanns,</HI> or Inns, extremely magnificent, many of them taking up a large &s;quare, built round with &s;hops under &s;tone arches, where poor artificers are lodged <HI>gratis.</HI> They have always a Mo&s;que joining to them, and the body of the <HI>Hann</HI> is a mo&s;t noble hall, capable of holding three or four hundred per&s;ons, the court extremely &s;pacious, and cloi&s;ters round it, that give it the air of our colleges. I own, I think it a more rea&s;onable piece of charity than the founding of convents.&mdash;I think I have now told you a great deal for once.

'tis ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for my own repo&s;e, to give it &s;ome vent. Without farther preface I will then begin my &s;tory.</P>
<P>I was invited to dine with the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI>'s lady, and it was with a great deal of plea&s;ure I prepared my&s;elf for an entertainment, which was never before given to any Chri&s;tian. I thought, I &s;hould very lit|tle &s;atisfy her curio&s;ity, (which I did not doubt was a con&s;iderable motive to the invitation) by going in a dre&s;s &s;he was u&s;ed to &s;ee, and therefore dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in the court habit of Vienna, which is much more magnificent than ours. However, I cho&s;e to go <HI>incog|nito,</HI> to avoid any di&s;putes about ceremony, and went in a Turki&s;h coach, only attended by my woman, that held up my train, and the Greek lady, who was my in|terprete&s;s. I was met, at the court-door, by her black Eunuch, who helped me out of the coach with great re&s;pect, and conducted me through &s;everal rooms, where her &s;he &s;laves, finely dre&s;&s;ed, were ranged on each &s;ide. In the innermo&s;t, I found the lady &s;itting on her &s;ofa, in a sable ve&s;t. She advanced to meet me, and pre&s;ented me half a dozen of her friends, with great civility. She &s;eemed a very good woman, near fifty years old. I was &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve &s;o lit|tle magnificence in her hou&s;e, the furniture being all very moderate; and except the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> its and number of her &s;laves, nothing about her appeared expen&s;ive. She gue&s;&s;ed at my thoughts, and told me, &s;he was no longer of an age to &s;pend either her time or money in &s;uperfluities; that her whole expence was in charity, and her whole employment praying to God. There was no affectation in this &s;peech; both &s;he and her husband are entirely given up to devotion. He never looks upon any other woman; and what is much more extraordinary, touches no bribes, notwith&s;tanding the
<PB N="108" REF="041644_0117_101AD2753B623988">
example of all his predece&s;&s;ors. He is &s;o &s;crupulous in this point, he would not accept Mr. W&mdash;'s pre|&s;ent, till he had been a&s;&s;ured over and over, that it was a &s;ettled perqui&s;ite of his place, at the entrance of every Amba&s;&s;ador. She entertained me with all kind of civility, till dinner came in, which was &s;erved, one di&s;h at a time, to a va&s;t number, all finely dre&s;&s;ed after their manner, which I don't think &s;o bad as you have perhaps heard it repre&s;ented. I am a very good judge of their eating, having lived three weeks in the hou&s;e of an <HI>Effendi</HI> at Belgrade, who gave us very magnificent dinners, dre&s;&s;ed by his own cooks. The fir&s;t week they plea&s;ed me extremely; but, I own, I t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n began to grow weary of their table, and de&s;ired our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wn cook might add a di&s;h or two after our man|ner. But I attribute this to cu&s;tom, and am very much inclined to believe that an Indian, who had ne|ver ta&s;ted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> either, would prefer their cookery to ours. Their &s;auces are very high, all the roa&s;t very much done. They u&s;e a great deal of very rich &s;pice. The &s;oop is &s;erved for the la&s;t di&s;h; and they have, at lea&s;t, as great a variety of ragouts, as we have. I was very &s;orry I could not eat of as many as the good lady would have had me, who was very earne&s;t in &s;erving me of every thing. The treat concluded with coffee and perfumes, which is a high mark of re&s;pect; two &s;laves kneeling <HI>cen&s;ed</HI> my hair, clothes, and handkerchief. After this ceremony, &s;he com|manded her &s;laves to play and dance, which they did with their guitars in their hands, and &s;he excu&s;ed to me their want of &s;kill, &s;aying &s;he took no care to ac|compli&s;h them in that art.</P>
<P>I returned her thanks, and &s;oon after took my leave. I was conducted back in the &s;ame manner I entered, and would have gone &s;trait to my own hou&s;e

but the Greek lady, with me, earne&s;tly &s;olicited me to vi&s;it the <HI>Kahya's</HI> lady, &s;aying, he was the &s;econd officer in the Empire, and ought indeed to be looked upon as the fir&s;t, the Grand Vizier having only the name, while he exerci&s;ed the authority. I had found &s;o lit|tle diver&s;ion in the Vizier's <HI>Haram,</HI> that I had no mind to go into another. But her importunity pre|vailed with me, and I am extremely glad, I was &s;o complai&s;ant. All things here were with quite another air than at the Grand Vizier's; and the very hou&s;e confessed the difference between an old devotee, and a young beauty. It was nicely clean and magnificent. I was met at the door by two black Eunuchs, who led me through a long gallery, between two ranks of beautiful young girls, with their hair finely plaited, almo&s;t hanging to their feet, all dre&s;&s;ed in fine light dama&s;ks, brocaded with &s;ilver. I was &s;orry that de|cency did not permit me to &s;top to con&s;ider them nearer. But that thought was lo&s;t upon my entrance into a large room, or rather pavillion, built round with gilded &s;a&s;hes, which were mo&s;t of them thrown up, and the trees planted near them gave an agreeable &s;hade, which hindered the Sun from being trouble|&s;ome. The je&s;&s;amines and honey-&s;uckles that twi&s;ted round their trunks, &s;hed a &s;oft perfume, increa&s;ed by a white marble fountain playing &s;weet water in the lower part of the room, which fell into three or four ba&s;ons, with a plea&s;ing &s;ound. The roof was painted with all &s;orts of flowers, falling out of gilded ba&s;kets, that &s;eemed tumbling down. On a Sofa, rai&s;ed three &s;teps, and covered with fine Per&s;ian carpets, &s;at the Kahya's lady, leaning on cu&s;hions of white &s;attin em|broidered; and at her feet &s;at two young girls about twelve years old, lovely as angels, dre&s;&s;ed perfectly rich, and almo&s;t covered with jewels. But they were

hardly &s;een near the fair <HI>Fatima,</HI> for that is her name) &s;o much her beauty effaced every thing I have &s;een, nay, all that has been called lovely either in England or Germany. I mu&s;t own, that I never &s;aw any thing &s;o gloriou&s;ly beautiful, nor can I recollect a face that would have been taken notice of near her's. She &s;tood up to receive me, &s;aluting me, after their fa&s;hion, putting her hand to her heart, with a &s;weetne&s;s full of maje&s;ty, that no court breeding could ever give. She ordered cu&s;hions to be given me, and took care to place me in the corner, which is the place of ho|nour. I confe&s;s, though the Greek lady had before given me a great opinion of her beauty, I was &s;o &s;truck with admiration, that I could not, for &s;ome time, &s;peak to her, being wholly taken up in gazing. That &s;urpri&s;ing harmony of features! That charm|ing re&s;ult of the whole! That exact proportion of body! That lovely bloom of complexion un&s;ullied by art! The unutterable enchantment of her &s;mile!&mdash;But her eyes!&mdash;Large and black, with all the &s;oft langui&s;hment of the blue! every turn of her face di&s;|covering &s;ome new grace.</P>
<P>After my fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e was over, I endeavoured, by nicely examining her face, to find out &s;ome imperfec|tion, without any fruit of my &s;earch, but my being clearly convinced of the error of that vulgar notion, that a face exactly proportioned, and perfectly beau|tiful, would not be agreeable; nature having done for her, with more &s;ucce&s;s, what <HI>Appelles</HI> is &s;aid to have e&s;&s;ayed by a collection of the mo&s;t exact features to form a perfect face. Add to all this, a behaviour &s;o full of grace and &s;weetne&s;s, &s;uch ea&s;y motions with an air &s;o maje&s;tic, yet free from &s;tiffne&s;s or affectation, that I am per&s;uaded, could &s;he be &s;uddenly tran&s;ported upon the mo&s;t polite throne of Europe, no body would
<PB N="111" REF="041644_0120_101ABFA10C68AE78">
think her other than born and bred to be a Queen, though educated in a country we call barbarous. To &s;ay all in a word, our mo&s;t celebrated Engli&s;h beauties would vani&s;h near her.</P>
<P>She was dre&s;&s;ed in a <HI>Caftan</HI> of gold brocade, flowered with &s;ilver, very well fitted to her &s;hape, and &s;hewing to advantage the beauty of her bo&s;om, only &s;haded by the thin gauze of her &s;hift. Her drawers were pale pink, her wai&s;tcoat green and &s;ilver, her &s;lippers white &s;attin finely embroidered; her lovely arms adorned with bracelets of diamonds, and her broad girdle &s;et round with diamonds; upon her head a rich Turki&s;h handkerchief of pink and &s;ilver, her own fine black hair hanging a great length, in various tre&s;&s;es, and on one &s;ide of her head &s;ome bodkins of jewels. I am afraid you will accu&s;e me of extravagance in this de&s;cription. I think I have read &s;omewhere, that women always &s;peak in rapture, when they &s;peak of beauty, and I cannot imagine why they &s;hould not be allowed to do &s;o. I rather think it a virtue to be able to admire without any mixture of de&s;ire or envy. The grave&s;t writers have &s;poke with great warmth of &s;ome celebrated pictures and &s;tatues. The work|man&s;hip of Heaven, certainly excels all our weak imitations, and I think, has a much better claim to our prai&s;e. For my part, I am not a&s;hamed to own, I took more plea&s;ure in looking on the beauteous <HI>Fatima</HI> than the fine&s;t piece of &s;culpture could have given me. She told me the two girls at her feet were her daugh|ters, though &s;he appeared too young to be their mo|ther. Her fair maids were ranged below the Sofa, to the number of twenty, and put me in mind of the pictures of the antient nymphs. I did not think all nature could have furni&s;hed &s;uch a &s;cene of beauty. She made them a &s;ign to play and dance. Four of

This dance was very different from what I had &s;een before. Nothing could be more artful, or more proper to rai&s;e <HI>certain ideas.</HI> The tunes &s;o &s;oft!&mdash;The motions &s;o langui&s;hing!

I am acquainted with a Greek lady, who &s;ings better than Mrs. <HI>Robin|&s;on,</HI> and is very well &s;killed in both, who gives the preference to the Turki&s;h. 'Tis certain they have very fine natural voices, the&s;e were very agreeable. When the dance was over, four fair &s;laves came into the room, with &s;ilver cen&s;ors in their hands, and per|fumed the air with amber, aloes-wood, and others &s;cents. After this, they &s;erved me coffee upon their knees, in the fine&s;t japan china, with <HI>&s;oucoups</HI> of &s;ilver gilt. The lovely <HI>Fatima</HI> entertained me, all this while, in the mo&s;t polite agreeable manner, calling me often <HI>Uzelle Sultanam,</HI> or the Beautiful Sultana, and de&s;iring my friend&s;hip with the be&s;t grace in the world, lamenting that &s;he could not entertain me in my own language.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Adrianople,</HI> <DATE>May 17, O. S.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM going to leave Adrianople, and I would not do it, without giving you &s;ome account of all that is curious in it, which I have taken a great deal of pains to &s;ee. I will not trouble you with wi&s;e di&s;&s;er|tations, whether or no this is the &s;ame city that was antiently called <HI>Ore&s;te&s;it</HI> or <HI>Ore&s;te,</HI> which you know better than I do. It is now called from the Emperor <HI>Adrian,</HI> and was the fir&s;t European &s;eat of the Turk|i&s;h Empire, and has been the favourite re&s;idence of many Sultans. MAHOMET the fourth, and MUSTA|PHA, the Brother of the reigning Emperor, were &s;o fond of it, that they wholly abandoned Con&s;tantino|ple, which humour &s;o far exa&s;perated the Janizaries, that it was a con&s;iderable motive to the rebellions that
<PB N="114" REF="041644_0123_101AD1A2F8CECD08">
depo&s;ed them. Yet this man &s;eems to love to keep his court here. I can give you no rea&s;on for this partiality. 'Tis true, the &s;ituation is fine, and the country all round very beautiful; but the air is ex|tremely bad, and the Seraglio it&s;elf is not free from the ill effect of it. The town is &s;aid to be eight miles in compa&s;s. I &s;uppo&s;e they reckon in the gardens. There are &s;ome good hou&s;es in it, I mean large ones; for the architecture of their palaces never makes any great &s;hew. It is now very full of people; but they are, mo&s;t of them, &s;uch as follow the court, or camp, and when they are removed, I am told 'tis no popu|lous city. The river <HI>Maritza</HI> (anciently the <HI>Hebrus</HI>) on which it is &s;ituated, is dried up every &s;ummer, which contributes very much to make it unwhole&s;ome. It is now a very plea&s;ant &s;tream. There are two noble bridges built over it. I had the curio&s;ity to go to &s;ee the Exchange in my Turki&s;h dre&s;s, which is di&s;gui&s;e &s;ufficient. Yet I own, I was not very ea&s;y when I &s;aw it crouded with Janizaries; but they dare not be rude to a woman, and made way for me with as much re&s;pect, as if I had been in my own figure. It is half a mile in length, the roof arched, and kept extremely neat. It holds three hundred and &s;ixty-five &s;hops, furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of rich goods, expo&s;ed to &s;ale in the &s;ame manner as at the New Exchange in London. But the pavement is kept much neater, and the &s;hops are all &s;o clean, they &s;eem ju&s;t new painted.&mdash;Idle people of all &s;orts walk here for their diver&s;ion, or amu&s;e them&s;elves with drinking coffee, or &s;herbet, which is cried about as oranges and &s;weet|meats are in our playhou&s;es. I ob&s;erved mo&s;t of the rich Trade&s;men were Jews. That people are in in|credible power in this country. They have many privileges above all the natural Turks them&s;elves, and
<PB N="115" REF="041644_0124_101AD1A60DC7D118">
have formed a very con&s;iderable common-wealth here, being judged by their own laws. They have drawn the whole trade of the Empire into their hands, partly by the firm union among&s;t them&s;elves, and partly by the idle temper and want of indu&s;try in the Turks. Every Ba&s;&s;a has his Jew, who is his <HI>"homme d'affaires;"</HI> he is let into all his &s;ecrets, and does all his bu&s;ine&s;s. No bargain is made, no bribe received, no merchan|di&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of, but what pa&s;&s;es through their hands. They are the phy&s;icians, the &s;tewards, and the in|terpreters of all the great men. You may judge how advantageous this is to a people who never fail to make u&s;e of the &s;malle&s;t advantages. They have found the &s;ecret of making them&s;elves &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that they are certain of the protection of the court, whatever mini&s;try is in power. Even the Engli&s;h, French, and Italian merchants, who are &s;en&s;ible of their artifices, are, however, forced to tru&s;t their affairs to their negotiation, nothing of trade being managed without them, and the meane&s;t among&s;t them being too important to be di&s;obliged, &s;ince the whole body take care of his intere&s;ts with as much vigour as they would tho&s;e of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of their members. There are many of them va&s;tly rich, but they take care to make little public &s;hew of it; though they live in their hou&s;es in the utmo&s;t luxury and magnificence. This copious &s;ubject has drawn me from my de&s;cription of the exchange, founded by <HI>Ali Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> who&s;e name it bears. Near it is the <HI>Sher&s;ki,</HI> a &s;treet of a mile in length, full of &s;hops of all kind of fine merchandi&s;e, but exce&s;&s;ive dear, nothing being made here. It is covered on the top with boards to keep out the rain, that merchants may meet conveniently in all weathers. The <HI>Be&s;iten</HI> near it, is another exchange, built upon pillars, where all
<PB N="116" REF="041644_0125_101AD1A793E96980">
&s;orts of hor&s;e furniture is &s;old. Glittering every where with gold, rich embroidery and jewels; it makes a very agreeable &s;hew. From this place I went in my Turki&s;h coach, to the camp, which is to move in a few days to the frontiers. The Sultan is already gone to his tents, and all his court; the appearance of them is, indeed, very magnificent. Tho&s;e of the great men are rather like palaces than tents, taking up a great compa&s;s of ground, and being divided into a va&s;t number of apartments. They are all of green, and the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a's of three Tails,</HI> have tho&s;e en&s;igns of their power placed in a very con&s;picuous manner be|fore their tents, which are adorned, on the top, with gilded balls, more or le&s;s, according to their different ranks. The ladies go in coaches to &s;ee the camp, as eagerly as ours did to that of <HI>Hyde-Park;</HI> but 'tis very ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that the &s;oldiers do not begin the campaign with any great chearfulne&s;s. The war is a general grievance upon the people, but particularly hard upon the trade&s;men, now that the Grand Signior is re&s;olved to lead his army in per&s;on. Every compa|ny of them is obliged, upon this occa&s;ion, to make a pre&s;ent according to their ability.</P>
<P>I took the pains of ri&s;ing at &s;ix in the morning to &s;ee the ceremony, which did not however begin till eight. The Grand Signior was at the Seraglio window, to &s;ee the proce&s;&s;ion, which pa&s;&s;ed thro' the principal &s;treets. It was preceded by an <HI>Effendi,</HI> mounted on a camel, richly furni&s;hed, reading aloud the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> finely bound, laid upon a cu&s;hion. He was &s;urrounded by a parcel of boys, in white, &s;inging &s;ome ver&s;es of it, followed by a man dre&s;&s;ed in green boughs, repre&s;ent|ing a clean husbandman &s;owing &s;eed. After him &s;e|veral reapers with garlands of ears of corn, as <HI>Ceres</HI> is pictured, with &s;cythes in their hands &s;eeming to mow.
<PB N="117" REF="041644_0126_101AD1AA6327B9B0">
Then a little machine drawn by oxen, in which was a wind-mill, and boys employed in grinding corn, fol|lowed by another machine drawn by buffaloes carrying an oven, and two more boys, one employed in kneading the bread, and another in drawing it out of the oven. The&s;e Boys threw little cakes on both &s;ides among&s;t the crowd, and were followed by the whole company of bakers, marching on foot, two by two, in their be&s;t cloaths, with cakes, loaves, pa&s;ties, and pies of all &s;orts on their heads, and after them two buffoons, or jack|puddings, with their faces and clothes &s;meared with meal, who diverted the mob with their antic ge&s;tures. In the &s;ame manner followed all the companies of trade in the Empire; the nobler &s;ort, &s;uch as jewellers, mercers, &amp;c. finely mounted, and many of the pageants that repre&s;ent their trades perfectly magnificent; among&s;t which, that of the Furriers made one of the be&s;t figures, being a very large machine &s;et round with the &s;kins of ermins, foxes, &amp;c. &s;o well &s;tuffed, that the animals &s;eemed to be alive, and followed by mu&s;ic and dancers. I believe they were, upon the whole, twenty thou&s;and men, all ready to follow his Highne&s;s if he commanded them. The rear was clo&s;ed by the volun|teers, who came to beg the honour of dying in his &s;ervice. This part of the &s;hew &s;eemed to me &s;o bar|borous, that I removed from the window upon the fir&s;t appearance of it. They were all naked to the mid|dle. Some had their arms pierced thorough with arrows left &s;ticking in them. Others had them &s;ticking in their heads, the blood trickling down their faces. Some &s;la&s;hed their arms with &s;harp knives, making the blood &s;pring out upon tho&s;e that &s;tood there; and this is looked upon as an expre&s;&s;ion of their zeal for glory. I am told, that &s;ome make u&s;e of it to advance their love;
<PB N="118" REF="041644_0127_101AD1ABE716CA48">
and when they are near the window, where their mi&s;|tre&s;s &s;tands (all the women in town being veiled to &s;ee this &s;pectacle) they &s;tick another arrow for her &s;ake, who gives &s;ome &s;ign of approbation and encou|ragement to this gallantry. The whole &s;hew la&s;ted for near eight hours, to my great &s;orrow, who was heartily tired, though I was in the hou&s;e of the widow of the <HI>Captain Ba&s;&s;a</HI> (Admiral) who refre&s;hed me with coffee, &s;weetmeats, &s;herbet, &amp;c. with all po&s;&s;ible civility.</P>
<P>I went two days after, to &s;ee the Mo&s;que of Sultan <HI>Selim</HI> I. which is a building very well worth the cu|rio&s;ity of a traveller. I was dre&s;&s;ed in my Turki&s;h ha|bit, and admitted without &s;cruple; though I believe they gue&s;&s;ed who I was, by the extreme officiou&s;ne&s;s of the door-keeper, to &s;hew me every part of it. It is &s;ituated very advantageou&s;ly in the mid&s;t of the city, and in the highe&s;t part of it, making a very noble &s;how. The fir&s;t court has four gates, and the inner|mo&s;t three. They are both of them &s;urrounded with cloi&s;ters, with marble pillars of the Ionic order, finely poli&s;hed, and of very lively colours; the whole pave|ment is of white marble, and the roof of the cloi&s;ters divided into &s;everal cupola's or domes, headed with gilt balls on the top. In the mid&s;t of each court are fine fountains of white marble; and before the great gate of the Mo&s;que a portico with green marble pillars, which has five gates, the body of the Mo&s;que being one prodigious dome. I under&s;tand &s;o little of architecture, I dare not pretend to &s;peak of the proportions. It &s;eemed to be very regular; this I am &s;ure of, it is va&s;tly high and I thought it the noble&s;t building I ever &s;aw. It has two rows of marble galleries on pillars, with marble ba|lu&s;tres; the pavement is al&s;o marble covered with Per&s;ian carpets. In my opinion, it is a great addition to its beauty, that it is not divided into pews, and en|cumbered with forms and benches like our churches;
<PB N="119" REF="041644_0128_101AD1AFA9B60250">
nor the pillars (which are mo&s;t of them red and white marble) disfigured by the little tawdry images, and pictures, that give Roman Catholic churches the air of toy-&s;hops. The walls &s;eemed to me inlaid, with &s;uch very lively colours, in &s;mall flowers, that I could not imagine what &s;tones had been made u&s;e of. But going nearer, I &s;aw they were cru&s;ted with japan china, which has a very beautiful effect. In the mid&s;t hung a va&s;t lamp of &s;ilver gilt; be&s;ides which, I do verily be|lieve, there were at lea&s;t two thou&s;and of a le&s;&s;er &s;ize. This mu&s;t look very glorious when they are all light|ed; but being at night, no women are &s;uffered to enter. Under the large lamp is a great pulpit of car|ved wood gilt, and ju&s;t by, a fountain to wa&s;h, which you know is an e&s;&s;ential part of their devotion. In one corner is a little gallery enclo&s;ed with gilded lattices, for the Grand Signior. At the upper end a large <HI>Niche,</HI> very like an altar, rai&s;ed two &s;teps, covered with gold brocade, and &s;tanding before it two &s;ilver gilt candle&s;ticks, the height of a man, and in them white wax candles, as thick as a man's wai&s;t. The out&s;ide of the Mo&s;que is adorned with towers va&s;tly high, gilt on the top, from whence the <HI>Imaums</HI> call the people to prayers. I had the cu|rio&s;ity to go up one of them, which is contrived &s;o art|fully, as to give &s;urprize to all that &s;ee it. There is but one door, which leads to three different &s;tair-ca&s;es, going to the three different &s;tories of the tower, in &s;uch a manner, that three prie&s;ts may a&s;cend, round|ing, without ever meeting each other; a contrivance very much admired. Behind the Mo&s;que, is an Ex|change full of &s;hops, where poor artificers are lodged gratis. I &s;aw &s;everal Dervi&s;es at their prayers here. They are dre&s;&s;ed in a plain piece of woollen, with their arms bare, and a woollen cap on their heads, like a high crowned hat without brims. I went to

&s;ee &s;ome other Mo&s;ques, built much after the &s;ame manner, but not comparable, in point of magnificence, to this I have de&s;cribed, which is infinitely beyond any church in Germany or England; I won't talk of other countries, I have not &s;een. The Seraglio does not &s;eem a very magnificent palace.

<P>I HAVE had the advantage of very fine weather all my journey, and as the &s;ummer is now in its beauty, I enjoyed the plea&s;ure of fine pro&s;pects; and the meadows being full of all &s;orts of garden flowers, and &s;weet herbs my berlin perfumed the air as it pre&s;|&s;ed them. The Grand Signior furni&s;hed us with thirty covered waggons for our baggage, and five coaches of the country for my women. We found the road full of the great <HI>Spahis</HI> and their equipages coming out of A&s;ia to the war. They always travel with tents; but I cho&s;e to lie in hou&s;es all the way. I will not trouble you with the names of the villages we pa&s;&s;ed, in which there was nothing remarkable, but at <HI>Ciorl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i,</HI> where there was a <HI>Conac,</HI> or little <HI>Seraglio,</HI> built for the u&s;e of the Grand Signior, when he goes this road. I had the curio&s;ity to view all the apartments de&s;tined for the ladies of his court. They were in the mid&s;t of a thick grove of trees, made fre&s;h by fountains; but I was mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the walls almo&s;t covered with little di&s;tichs of Tur|ki&s;h ver&s;e, writ with pencils. I made my interpreter explain them to me, and I found &s;everal of them very well turned; tho' I ea&s;ily believed him, that they had lo&s;t much of their beauty in the tran&s;lation. One was literally thus in Engli&s;h.

The re&s;t of our journey was through fine painted meadows, by the &s;ide of the &s;ea of <HI>Marmora,</HI> the antient Propontis. We lay the next night at <HI>Seliv|rea,</HI> antiently a noble town. It is now a good &s;ea port, and neatly built enough, and has a bridge of thirty-two arches. Here is a famous antient Greek church. I had given one of my coaches to a Greek lady, who de&s;ired the conveniency of travelling with me; &s;he de&s;igned to pay her devotions, and I was glad of the opportunity of going with her. I found it an ill built edifice, &s;et out with the &s;ame &s;ort of orna|ments, but le&s;s rich, as the Roman Catholic churches. They &s;hewed me a &s;aint's body, where I threw a piece of money; and a picture of the Virgin Mary, drawn by the hand of St. LUKE, very little to the credit of his painting; but, however, the fine&s;t Madona of Italy, is not more famous for her miracles. The Greeks have a mon&s;trous ta&s;te in their pictures, which, for more fine|ry, are always drawn upon a gold ground. You may imagine what a good air this has; but they have no notion either of &s;hade or proportion. They have a bi&s;hop here, who officiated in his purple robe, and &s;ent me a candle almo&s;t as big as my&s;elf for a pre&s;ent, when I was at my lodging. We lay that night at a town called <HI>Bujuk Cekmege,</HI> or Great Bridge; and the night following, at <HI>Kujuk Cekmege,</HI> or Little Bridge, in a very plea&s;ant lodging, formerly a mona&s;tery of Dervi&s;es, having before it a large court, encompa&s;&s;ed with marble cloi&s;ters, with a good fountain in the middle. The pro&s;pect from this place, and the gar|dens round it, is the mo&s;t agreeable I have &s;een; and &s;hews, that monks of all religions know how to choo&s;e their retirements. 'Tis now belonging to a <HI>Hogia,</HI> or School-ma&s;ter, who teaches boys here. I a&s;ked him to &s;hew me his own apartment, and was &s;urpri&s;ed
<PB N="123" REF="041644_0132_101AD27849547168">
to &s;ee him point to a tall cypre&s;s tree in the garden, on the top of which was a place for a bed for him&s;elf, and a little lower one for his wife and two children, who &s;lept there every night. I was &s;o much diverted with the fancy. I re&s;olved to examine his ne&s;t nearer; but after going up fifty &s;teps, I found I had &s;till fifty to go up, and then I mu&s;t climb from branch to branch, with &s;ome hazard of my neck. I thought it therefore the be&s;t way to come down again.</P>
<P>We arrived the next day at Con&s;tantinople; but I can yet tell you very little of it, all my time having been taken up with receiving vi&s;its, which are, at lea&s;t, a very good entertainment to the eyes, the young women being all beauties, and their beauty highly improved by the high ta&s;te of their dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Our palace is in <HI>Pera,</HI> which is no more a &s;uburb of Con&s;tantinople, than We&s;tmin&s;ter is a &s;uburb to London. All the Amba&s;&s;adors are lodged very near each other. One part of our hou&s;e &s;hews us the Port, the City, and the Seraglio, and the di&s;tant hills of Asia, perhaps, all together, the mo&s;t beautiful pro&s;pect in the world.</P>
<P>A certain French author &s;ays, <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> is twice as big as <HI>Paris.</HI> Mr. W&mdash;y is unwilling to own 'tis bigger than London, though I confe&s;s it ap|pears to me to be &s;o; but I don't believe 'tis &s;o po|pulous. The burying fields about it are certainly much larger than the whole city. 'Tis &s;urpri&s;ing what a va&s;t deal of land is lo&s;t this way in Turkey. Sometimes I have &s;een burying places of &s;everal miles, belonging to very incon&s;iderable villages, which were formerly great towns, and retain no other mark of their antient grandeur, than this di&s;mal one. On no occa&s;ion do they ever remove a &s;tone that &s;erves for a monument. Some of them are co&s;tly enough,
<PB N="124" REF="041644_0133_101AD27BA8BB5670">
for a monument. Some of them are co&s;tly enough, being of very fine marble. They &s;et up a pillar with a carved turbant on the top of it, to the memory of a man; and as the turbants, by their different &s;hapes, &s;hew the quality or profe&s;&s;ion, 'tis in a manner put|ting up the arms of the decea&s;ed. Be&s;ides, the pillar commonly bears an in&s;cription in gold letters. The ladies have a &s;imple pillar, without other ornament, except tho&s;e that die unmarried, who have a ro&s;e on the top of their monument. The &s;epulchres of par|ticular families are railed in, and planted round with trees. Tho&s;e of the Sultans, and &s;ome great men, have lamps con&s;tantly burning in them.</P>
<P>When I &s;poke of their religion, I forgot to men|tion two particularities, one of which I had read of, but it &s;eemed &s;o odd to me, I could not believe it; yet 'tis certainly true; that when a man has divorced his wife, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, he can take her again upon no other terms, than permitting another man to pa&s;s a night with her; and there are &s;ome examples of tho&s;e who have &s;ubmitted to this law, rather than not have back their beloved. The other point of doctrine is very extraordinary. Any woman that dies unmarried, is looked upon to die in a &s;tate of reprobation. To confirm this belief, they rea&s;on, that the end of the creation of woman, is to increa&s;e and multiply, and that &s;he is only properly employed in the works of her calling, when &s;he is bringing forth children, or taking care of them, which are all the virtues that God expects from her. And in|deed, their way of life, which &s;huts them out of all public commerce, does not permit them any other. Our vulgar notion, that they don't own women to have any &s;ouls, is a mi&s;take. 'Tis true they &s;ay, they are not of &s;o elevated a kind, and therefore mu&s;t
<PB N="125" REF="041644_0134_101AD27DEF70D620">
not hope to be admitted into the Paradi&s;e appointed for the men, who are to be entertained by cele&s;tial beauties. But there is a place of happine&s;s de&s;tined for &s;ouls of the inferior order, where all good women are to be in eternal bli&s;s. Many of them are very &s;uper|&s;titious, and will not remain widows ten days, for fear of dying in the reprobate &s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a u&s;ele&s;s crea|ture. But tho&s;e, that like their liberty, and are not &s;laves to their religion, content them&s;elves with mar|rying when they are afraid of dying. This is a piece of theology, very different from that, which teaches nothing to be more acceptable to God, than a vow of perpetual virginity; which divinity is mo&s;t ratio|nal, I leave you to determine.</P>
<P>I have already made &s;ome progre&s;s in a collection of Greek medals. Here are &s;everal profe&s;&s;ed anti|quaries, who are ready to &s;erve any body that de&s;ires them. But you cannot imagine how they &s;tare in my face, when I enquire about them, as if no body was permitted to &s;eek after medals, till they were grown a piece of antiquity them&s;elves. I have got &s;ome very valuable ones of the Macedonian Kings, parti|cularly one of PERSEUS, &s;o lively, I fancy I can &s;ee all his ill qualities in his face. I have a Porphyry head finely cut, of the true Greek &s;culpture; but who is repre&s;ents, is to be gue&s;&s;ed at by the learned when I return. For you are not to &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e antiquaries (who are all Greeks) know any thing. Their trade is only to &s;ell; they have corre&s;pondents at Aleppo, Grand Cairo, in Arabia and Pale&s;tine, who &s;end them all they can find, and very often great heaps, that are only fit to melt into pans and kettles. They get the be&s;t price they can for any of them, without knowing tho&s;e that are valuable, from tho&s;e that are not. Tho&s;e that pretend to &s;kill, generally find
<PB N="126" REF="041644_0135_101AD27F74166D48">
Greek cities. One of them, &s;hewing me the figure of a Pallas, with a victory in her hand on a rever&s;e, a&s;&s;ured me it was the Virgin holding a crucifix. The &s;ame man offered me the head of a Socrates, on a Sardonix; and to enhance the value, gave him the title of Saint Augu&s;tine. I have be&s;poke a mummy, which, I hope, will come &s;afe to my hands, notwith|&s;tanding the misfortune that befel a very fine one, de&s;igned for the King of Sweden. He gave a great price for it, and the Turks took it into their heads, that he mu&s;t have &s;ome con&s;iderable project depend|ing upon it. They fancied it the body of God knows who, and that the &s;tate of their Empire my&s;tically depended on the con&s;ervation of it. Some old pro|phecies were remembered upon this occa&s;ion, and the mummy committed pri&s;oner to the Seven Towers, where it has remained under clo&s;e confinement ever &s;ince. I dare not try my intere&s;t in &s;o con&s;iderable a point, as the relea&s;e of it; but I hope mine will pa&s;s without examination. I can tell you nothing more at pre&s;ent of this famous city. When I have looked a little about me, you &s;hall hear from me again. I am, Sir,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO Mr. Pope.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Belgrade-Village,</HI> <DATE>June 17,</DATE> O. S.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE before this time, you have received two or three of my letters. I had yours but ye&s;|terday, though dated the third of February, in which you &s;uppo&s;e me to be dead and buried. I have already let you know that I am &s;till alive; but to &s;ay truth, I look upon my pre&s;ent circum&s;tances to be exactly the &s;ame with tho&s;e of departed &s;pirits. The heats of Con&s;tantinople have driven me to this place, which perfectly an&s;wers the de&s;cription of the Ely&s;ian fields. I am in the middle of a wood, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of fruit trees, watered by a va&s;t number of fountains, famous for the excellency of their water, and divided into many &s;hady walks, upon &s;hort gra&s;s, that &s;eems to me artificial; but, I am a&s;&s;ured, is the pure work of nature&mdash;within view of the Black-&s;ea, from whence we perpetually enjoy the refre&s;hment of cool breezes, that makes us in&s;en&s;ible of the heat of the &s;ummer. The village is only inhabited by the riche&s;t among&s;t the Chri&s;tians, who meet every night at a fountain, forty paces from my hou&s;e, to &s;ing and dance. The beauty and dre&s;s of the women, exactly re&s;emble the ideas of the antient nymphs, as they are given us by the repre&s;entations of the poets and painters. But what per&s;uades me more fully of my decea&s;e, is the &s;ituation of my own mind, the pro|found ignorance I am in, of what pa&s;&s;es among the living (which only comes to me by chance) and the
<PB N="128" REF="041644_0137_101AD284B0E99758">
great calmne&s;s with which I receive it. Yet I have &s;till a hankering after my friends and acquaintances left in the world, according to the authority of that admirable author,
<Q><L><HI>That &s;pirits departed are wonderous kind,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To friends and relations left behind,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which no body can deny.</HI></L></Q>
Of which &s;olemn truth I am a <HI>dead</HI> in&s;tance. I think <HI>Virgil</HI> is of the &s;ame opinion, that in human &s;ouls there will &s;till be &s;ome remains of human pa&s;&s;ions:
<Q><L>&mdash;<HI>Curae non ip&s;ae in morte relinquunt.</HI></L></Q>
And 'tis very nece&s;&s;ary to make a perfect Ely&s;ium, that there &s;hould be a river <HI>Lethe,</HI> which I am not &s;o happy as to find. To &s;ay truth, I am &s;ometimes very weary of the &s;inging and dancing, and &s;un&s;hine, and wi&s;h for the &s;moke and impertinencies in which you toil; though I endeavour to per&s;uade my&s;elf that I live in a more agreeable variety than you do; and that <HI>Monday,</HI> &s;etting of partridges; <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> reading Engli&s;h; <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> &s;tudying in the Turki&s;h language, (in which, by the way, I am already very learned;) <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> cla&s;&s;ical authors; <HI>Friday,</HI> &s;pent in writing; <HI>Saturday,</HI> at my needle, and <HI>Sunday,</HI> ad|mitting of vi&s;its and hearing of mu&s;ic, is a better way of di&s;po&s;ing of the week, than, <HI>Monday</HI> at the draw|ing-room; <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> Lady Mohun's; <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> at the opera; <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> the play; <HI>Friday,</HI> Mrs. Chet|wynd's, &amp;c. a perpetual round of hearing the &s;ame &s;candal, and &s;eeing the &s;ame follies acted over and over, which here affect me no more than they do other dead people. I can now hear of di&s;plea&s;ing things with pity and without indignation. The re|flection
<PB N="129" REF="041644_0138_101AD286F1016CE8">
on the great gulph between you and me, cools all news that come hither. I can neither be &s;en&s;ibly touched with joy or grief, when I con&s;ider that, po&s;&s;ibly, the cau&s;e of either is removed, before the letter comes to my hands. But (as I &s;aid before) this indolence does not extend to my few friend|&s;hips; I am &s;till warmly &s;en&s;ible of yours and Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI>'s, and de&s;ire to live in your remembrance, though dead to all the world be&s;ide.</P>

<HEAD>To the Lady&mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Belgrade Village,</HI> <DATE>June 17,</DATE> O. S.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HEARTILY beg your lady&s;hip's pardon; but I really could nor forbear laughing heartily at your letter, and the commi&s;&s;ions you are plea&s;ed to honour me with. You de&s;ire me to buy you a Greek &s;lave, who is to be mi&s;tre&s;s of a thou&s;and good qualities. The Greeks are <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> and not <HI>&s;laves.</HI> Tho&s;e who are to be bought in that manner, are either &s;uch as are taken in war, or &s;tolen by the Tartars, from Ru&s;&s;ia, Circa&s;&s;ia or Georgia, and are &s;uch mi&s;erable awkward poor wretches, you would not think any of them fit to be your hou&s;e maids. 'Tis true, that many thou&s;ands were taken in the <HI>Morea;</HI> but they have been mo&s;t of them redeemed by the charitable contributions of the Chri&s;tians, or ran&s;omed by their own relations at Venice. The fine
<PB N="130" REF="041644_0139_101AD289FA8D5970">
&s;laves that wait upon the great ladies, or &s;erve the plea&s;ures of the great men, are all bought at the age of eight or nine years old, and educated with great care to accompli&s;h them in &s;inging, dancing, embroi|dery, &amp;c, they are commonly <HI>Circa&s;&s;ians,</HI> and their patron never &s;ells them, except it is, as a puni&s;hment for &s;ome very great fault. If ever they grow weary of them, they either pre&s;ent them to a friend, or give them their freedom. Tho&s;e that are expo&s;ed to &s;ale at the markets, are always either guilty of &s;ome crime, or &s;o entirely worthle&s;s, that they are of no u&s;e at all. I am afraid that you will doubt the truth of this account, which, I own, is very different from our common notions in England; but it is no le&s;s truth for all that.&mdash;Your whole letter is full of mi&s;takes from one end to the other. I &s;ee you have taken your ideas of Turkey from that worthy author <HI>Dumont,</HI> who has writ with equal ignorance and confidence. 'Tis a particular plea&s;ure to me here, to read the voy|ages to the Levant, which are generally &s;o far re|moved from truth, and &s;o full of ab&s;urdities, I am very well diverted with them. They never fail giving you an account of the women, whom, 'tis certain, they never &s;aw; and talking very wi&s;ely of the genius of the men, into who&s;e company they are never admittted; and very often de&s;cribe <HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> which they dared not even peep into. The Turks are very proud, and will not conver&s;e with a &s;tranger they are not a&s;&s;ured is con&s;iderable in his own country. I &s;peak of the men of di&s;tinction; for, as to the ordinary fellows, you may imagine what ideas their conver&s;ation can give of the general genius of the people.</P>
<P>As to the balm of <HI>Mecca,</HI> I will certainly &s;end you &s;ome; but it is not &s;o ea&s;ily got as you &s;uppo&s;e it, and I cannot in con&s;cience advi&s;e you to make u&s;e of it. I
<PB N="131" REF="041644_0140_101AD28D9B766D10">
know not how it comes to have &s;uch univer&s;al applau&s;e. All the Ladies of my acquaintance at London and Vienna, have begged me to &s;end pots of it to them. I have had a pre&s;ent of a &s;mall quantity (which I'll a&s;|&s;ure you is very valuable) of the be&s;t &s;ort, and with great joy applied it to my face, expecting &s;ome won|derful effect to my advantage. The next morning the change, indeed, was wonderful; my face was &s;welled to a very extraordinary &s;ize, and all over as red as my Lady H&mdash;'s. It remained in this lamentable &s;tate three days, during which you may be &s;ure I pa&s;&s;ed my time very ill. I believed it would never be other|wi&s;e; and to add to my mortification, Mr. W&mdash;y reproached my indi&s;cretion without cea&s;ing. How|ever my face is &s;ince in <HI>&s;tatu quo;</HI> nay, I am told by the ladies here, that 'tis much mended by the opera|tion, which I confe&s;s I cannot perceive in my looking gla&s;s. Indeed, if one was to form an opinion of this balm from their faces, one &s;hould think very well of it. They all make u&s;e of it, and have the lovelie&s;t bloom in the world. For my part, I never intend to endure the pain of it again; let my complexion take its natural cour&s;e, and decay in its own due time. I have very little e&s;teem for medicines of this nature; but do as you plea&s;e, Madam; only remember, before you u&s;e it, that your face will not be &s;uch as you will care to &s;hew in the drawing room for &s;ome days after. If one was to believe the women in this country, there is a &s;urer way of making one's &s;elf beloved, than by becoming hand&s;ome, though you know that's our me|thod. But they pretend to the knowledge of &s;ecrets, that, by way of enchantment, give them the entire empire over whom they plea&s;e. For me, who am not very apt to believe in wonders, I cannot find faith for this. I di&s;puted the point la&s;t night with a lady, this
<PB N="132" REF="041644_0141_101AD28FD81106A8">
who really talks very &s;en&s;ibly on any other &s;ubject: but &s;he was downright angry with me, in that &s;he did not perceive &s;he had per&s;uaded me of the truth of forty &s;tories &s;he told me of this kind; and, at la&s;t, mentioned &s;everal ridiculous marriages, that there could be no other rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for. I a&s;&s;ured her, that in England, where we were entirely ignorant of all magick, where the climate is not half &s;o warm, nor the women half &s;o hand&s;ome, we were not without our ridiculous marriages; and that we did not look upon it, as any thing &s;upernatural, when a man played the fool for the &s;ake of a woman. But my argu|ments could not convince her again&s;t (as &s;he &s;aid) her certain knowledge. To this &s;he added, that &s;he &s;crupled making u&s;e of <HI>charms</HI> her&s;elf; but that &s;he could do it whenever &s;he plea&s;ed; and &s;taring me in my face, &s;aid, (with a very learned air) that no enchantments would have their effects upon me, and that there were &s;ome people exempt from their power, but very few. You may imagine how I laughed at this di&s;cour&s;e: but all the women are of the &s;ame opinion. They don't pretend to any com|merce with the devil, but only that there are certain compo&s;itions adapted to in&s;pire love. If one could &s;end over a &s;hip-load of them, I fancy it would be a very quick way of rai&s;ing an e&s;tate. What would not &s;ome ladies of our acquaintance give for &s;uch merchandize? Adieu, my dear lady&mdash;I cannot con|clude my letter with a &s;ubject that affords more de|lightful &s;cenes to the imagination. I leave you to figure to your&s;elf, the extreme court that will be made to me, at my return, if my travels &s;hould furni&s;h me &s;uch a u&s;eful piece of learning. I am, dear Madam,</P>

<HEAD>To Mrs. T&mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Pera of Con&s;tantinople,</HI> <DATE>Jan. 4, O. S.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM infinitely obliged to you, dear Mrs. T&mdash;for your entertaining letter. You are the only one of my corre&s;pondents that have judged right enough, to think I would gladly be informed of the news among&s;t you. All the re&s;t of them tell me (almo&s;t in the &s;ame words) that they &s;uppo&s;e I know every thing. Why they are plea&s;ed to &s;uppo&s;e in this manner, I can gue&s;s no rea&s;on, except they are per&s;uaded that the breed of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s pigeon &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in this country, and that I receive &s;uperna|tural intelligence. I wi&s;h I could return your good|ne&s;s with &s;ome diverting accounts from hence. But I know not what part of the &s;cenes here would gra|tify your curio&s;ity, or whether you have any curio|&s;ity at all, for things &s;o far di&s;tant. To &s;ay the truth, I am, at this pre&s;ent writing, not very much turned for the recollection of what is diverting, my head being wholly filled with the preparations ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the increa&s;e of my family, which I expect every day. You may ea&s;ily gue&s;s at my unea&s;y &s;itu|ation. But I am, however, comforted in &s;ome de|gree, by the glory that accrues to me from it, and a reflection on the contempt I &s;hould otherwi&s;e fall under. You won't know what to make of this &s;peech: but, in this country, 'tis more de&s;picable to be married and not fruitful, than 'tis with us to be fruitful before marriage. They have a notion, that whenever a woman leaves off bringing forth chil|dren,
<PB N="134" REF="041644_0143_101AD29397C334C8">
'tis becau&s;e &s;he is too old for that bu&s;ine&s;s, whatever her face &s;ays to the contrary. This opi|nion makes the ladies here &s;o ready to make proofs of their youth, (which is as nece&s;&s;ary in order to be a <HI>received beauty,</HI> as it is to &s;hew the proofs of nobi|lity, to be admitted <HI>Knights of Malta</HI>) that they do not content them&s;elves with u&s;ing the natural means, but fly to all &s;orts of quackeries to avoid the &s;candal of being pa&s;t child-bearing, and often kill them&s;elves by them. Without any exaggeration, all the women of my acquaintance have twelve or thirteen children; and the old ones boa&s;t of having had five and twenty or thirty a-piece, and are re&s;pected according to the number they have produced.&mdash;When they are with child, 'tis their common expre&s;&s;ion to &s;ay, <HI>They hope God will be &s;o merciful as to &s;end them two this time;</HI> and when I have a&s;ked them &s;ometimes, how they ex|pected to provide for &s;uch a flock as they de&s;ire? They an&s;wer, that the plague will certainly kill half of them; which, indeed, generally happens without much con|cern to the parents, who are &s;atisfied with the vanity of having brought forth &s;o plentifully. The French Amba&s;&s;adre&s;s is forced to comply with this fa&s;hion as well as my&s;elf. She has not been here much above a year, and has lain in once, and is big again. What is mo&s;t wonderful, is, the exemption they &s;eem to en|joy from the cur&s;e entailed on the &s;ex. They &s;ee all company the day of their delivery, and at the fortnight's end, return vi&s;its, &s;et out in their jewels and new clothes. I wi&s;h I may find the influence of the climate in this particular. But I fear I &s;hall continue an Engli&s;h woman in that affair, as well as I do in my dread of fire and plague, which are two things very little feared here. Mo&s;t families have had their hou&s;es burnt down once or twice, occa&s;ioned by their

extraordinary way of warming them&s;elves, which is neither by chimnies nor &s;toves, but by a certain ma|chine called a <HI>Tendour,</HI> the height of two foot, in the form of a table, covered with a fine carpet or em|broidery. This is made only of wood, and they put into it a &s;mall quantity of hot a&s;hes, and &s;it with their legs under the carpet. At this table they work, read, and, very often, &s;leep; and if they chance to dream, kick down the <HI>Tendour,</HI> and the hot a&s;hes commonly &s;et the hou&s;e on fire. There were five hundred hou&s;es burnt in this manner about a fortnight ago, and I have &s;een &s;everal of the owners &s;ince, who &s;eem not at all moved at &s;o common a misfortune. They put their goods into a <HI>Bark,</HI> and &s;ee their hou&s;es burn with great philo&s;ophy, their per&s;ons being very &s;el|dom endangered, having no &s;tairs to de&s;cend.</P>
<P>But having entertained you with things I don't like, 'tis but ju&s;t I &s;hould tell you &s;omething what plea&s;es me. The climate is delightful in the extreme&s;t de|gree. I am now &s;itting, this pre&s;ent fourth of January, with the windows open, enjoying the warm &s;hine of the Sun, while you are freezing over a &s;ad &s;ea-coal fire; and my chamber is &s;et out with carnations, ro&s;es, and jonquils, fre&s;h from my garden. I am al&s;o charmed with many points of the Turki&s;h law, to our &s;hame be it &s;poken, better de&s;igned, and better executed than ours; particularly, the puni&s;hment of convicted liars (triumphant criminals in our country God knows:) They are burnt in the forehead with a hot iron, when they are proved the authors of any notorious fal&s;e|hoods. How many white foreheads &s;hould we &s;ee disfigured? How many fine gentlemen would be forced to wear their wigs as low as their eye-brows, were this law in practice with us? I &s;hould go on to tell you many other parts of ju&s;tice, but I mu&s;t &s;end for my midwife.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Pera of Con&s;tantinople,</HI> <DATE>March 10, O. S.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not written to you, dear &s;i&s;ter, the&s;e many months&mdash;a great piece of &s;elf-denial. But But I know not where to direct, or what part of the world you are in. I have received no letter from you &s;ince that &s;hort note of April la&s;t, in which you tell me, that you are on the point of leaving England, and promi&s;e me a direction for the place you &s;tay in; but I have, in vain, expected it till now, and now I only learn from the Gazette, that you are returned, which induces me to venture this letter to your hou&s;e at London. I had rather ten of my letters &s;hould be lo&s;t, than you imagine I don't write; and I think it is hard fortune, if one in ten don't reach you. How|ever, I am re&s;olved to keep the copies, as te&s;timonies of my inclination to give you, to the utmo&s;t of my power, all the diverting part of my travels, while you are exempt from all the fatigues and inconveni|encies.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place then, I wi&s;h you joy of your niece; for I was brought to bed of a daughter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pre&s;ent Counte&s;s of Bute.</NOTE> five weeks ago. I don't mention this as one of my divert|ing adventures; though I mu&s;t own, that it is not half &s;o mortifying here as in England; there being as much difference, as there is between a little cold in the head, which &s;ometimes happens here, and the con&s;umption coughs &s;o common in London.

body keeps their hou&s;e a month for lying in; and I am not &s;o fond of any of our cu&s;toms, as to retain them when they are not nece&s;&s;ary. I returned my vi&s;its at three weeks end, and about four days ago cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea, which divides this place from Con|&s;tantinople, to make a new one, where I had the good fortune to pick up many curio&s;ities. I went to &s;ee the Sultana <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iten,</HI> favourite of the late Empe|ror Mu&s;tapha, who, you know, (or perhaps you don't know) was depo&s;ed by his brother, the reigning Sultan, and died a few weeks after, being poi&s;oned, as it was generally believed. This lady was, imme|diately after his death, &s;aluted with an ab&s;olute order to leave the Seraglio, and choo&s;e her&s;elf a husband among the great men at the Porte. I &s;uppo&s;e you may imagine her overjoyed, at this propo&s;al&mdash;Quite the contrary.&mdash;The&s;e women, who are cal|led and e&s;teem them&s;elves Queens, look upon this liberty, as the greate&s;t di&s;grace and affront that can happen to them. She threw her&s;elf at the Sultan's feet, and begged him to poignard her, rather than u&s;e her brother's widow with that contempt. She repre&s;ented to him, in agonies of &s;orrow, that &s;he was privileged from this misfortune, by having brought five princes into the Ottoman family; but all the boys being dead, and only one girl &s;urviving, this excu&s;e was not received, and &s;he was compelled to make her choice. She cho&s;e <HI>Bekir Effendi,</HI> then &s;e|cretary of &s;tate, and above four-&s;core years old, to convince the world that &s;he firmly intended to keep the vow &s;he had made, of never &s;uffering a &s;econd husband to approach her bed; and &s;ince &s;he mu&s;t honour &s;ome &s;ubject &s;o far, as to be called his wife, &s;he would choo&s;e him, as a mark of her gratitude, &s;ince it was he that had pre&s;ented her at the age of ten

years to her la&s;t lord. But &s;he never permitted him to pay her one vi&s;it; though it is now fifteen years &s;he has been in his hou&s;e, where &s;he pa&s;&s;es her time in uninterrupted mourning, with a con&s;tancy very lit|tle known in Chri&s;tendom, e&s;pecially in a widow of one and twenty, for &s;he is now but thirty-&s;ix. She has no black Eunuchs for her guard, her husband being obliged to re&s;pect her as a Queen, and not to inquire, at all, into what is done in her apartment.</P>
<P>I was led into a large room, with a Sofa the whole length of it, adorned with white marble pillars like a <HI>Ruelle,</HI> covered with pale blew figured velvet, on a &s;ilver ground, with cu&s;hions of the &s;ame, where I was de&s;ired to repo&s;e till the Sultana appeared, who had contrived this manner of reception to avoid ri&s;ing up at my entrance, though &s;he made me an inclina|tion of her head, when I ro&s;e up to her. I was very glad to ob&s;erve a lady that had been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the favour of an Emperor, to whom beauties were every day, pre&s;ented from all parts of the world. But &s;he did not &s;eem to me to have ever been half &s;o beautiful as the fair <HI>Fatima</HI> I &s;aw at Adrianople; though &s;he had the remains of a fine face, more de|cayed by &s;orrow than time. But her dre&s;s was &s;ome|thing &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly rich, that I cannot forbear de|&s;cribing it to you. She wore a ve&s;t called <HI>Dualma,</HI> which differs from a Caftan by longer &s;leeves, and folding over at the bottom. It was of purple cloth, &s;trait to her &s;hape, and thick &s;et, on each &s;ide down to her feet and round the &s;leeves, with pearls of the be&s;t water, of the &s;ame &s;ize as their buttons commonly are. You mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e that I mean as large as tho&s;e of my Lord&mdash;, but about the bigne&s;s of a pea; and to the&s;e buttons, large loops of diamonds, in the form of tho&s;e gold loops, &s;o common on birth|day
<PB N="139" REF="041644_0148_101AD2A1CEFD95E0">
day coats. This habit was tied, at the wai&s;t, with two large ta&s;&s;els of &s;maller pearls, and round the arms embroidered with large diamonds. Her &s;hift was fa&s;t|ned, at the bottom, with a great diamond, &s;haped like a lozenge; her girdle, as broad as the broade&s;t En|gli&s;h ribband, entirely covered with diamonds. Round her neck &s;he wore three chains, which reached to her knees; one of large pearl, at the bottom of which hung a fine coloured emerald as big as a turkey-egg; another, con&s;i&s;ting of two hundred emeralds, clo&s;e joined together, of the mo&s;t lively green, perfect|ly matched, every one as large as a half-crown piece, and as thick as three crown pieces, and another of &s;mall emeralds perfectly round. But her ear-rings eclip&s;ed all the re&s;t. They were two diamonds &s;haped exactly like pears, as large as a big hazle-nut. Round her <HI>Talpoche</HI> &s;he had four &s;trings of pearl&mdash;the white&s;t and mo&s;t perfect in the world, at lea&s;t enough to make four necklaces, every one as large as the Duche&s;s of Marlborough's, and of the &s;ame &s;hape, fa&s;tened with two ro&s;es, con&s;i&s;ting of a large ruby for the middle &s;tone, and round them twenty drops of clean diamonds to each. Be&s;ides this, her head|dre&s;s was covered with bodkins of emeralds and dia|monds. She wore large diamond bracelets, and had five rings on her fingers (except Mr. Pitt's) the large&s;t I ever &s;aw in my life. 'Tis for jewellers to compute the value of the&s;e things; but, according to the common e&s;timation of jewels in our part of the world, her whole dre&s;s mu&s;t be worth a hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. This I am &s;ure of, that no European Queen has half the quantity, and the Empre&s;s's jewels, though very fine, would look very mean near hers. She gave me a dinner of fifty di&s;hes of meat, which (after their fa&s;hion) were placed
<PB N="140" REF="041644_0149_101AD2A3527BD790">
on the table but one at a time, and was extremely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">dious. But the magnificence of her table an&s;wered very well to that of her dre&s;s. The knives were of gold, and the hafts &s;et with diamonds. But the piece of luxury which grieved my eyes, was the ta|ble-cloth and napkins, which were all tiffany embroi|dered with &s;ilk and gold, in the fine&s;t manner, in natural flowers. It was with the utmo&s;t regret that I made u&s;e of the&s;e co&s;tly napkins, which were as finely wrought as the fine&s;t handkerchiefs that ever came out of this country. You may be &s;ure, that they were entirely &s;poiled before dinner was over. The <HI>&s;herbet</HI> (which is the liquor they drink at meals) was &s;erved in china bowls; but the covers and &s;alvers ma&s;&s;y gold. After dinner, water was brought in gold ba&s;ons, and towels of the &s;ame kind with the napkins, which I very unwillingly wiped my hands upon, and coffee was &s;erved in china with gold <HI>Soucoups</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Saucers.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Sultana &s;eemed in a very good humour, and talked to me with the utmo&s;t civility. I did not omit this opportunity of learning all that I po&s;&s;ibly could of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> which is &s;o entirely unknown among&s;t us. She a&s;&s;ured me that the &s;tory of the Sultan's <HI>throwing a handkerchief,</HI> is altogether fabu|lous; and the manner, upon that occa&s;ion, is no other than this: He &s;ends the <HI>Ky&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ir Aga,</HI> to &s;ignify to the lady the honour he intends her&punc; She is immediately complimented upon it by the others, and led to the bath, where &s;he is perfumed and dre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t magnificent and becoming manner. The Emperor precedes his vi&s;it by a royal pre&s;ent, and then comes into her apartment: neither is there any &s;uch thing
<PB N="141" REF="041644_0150_101AD2A584C17BC8">
as her creeping in at the bed's foot. She &s;aid, that the fir&s;t he made choice of, was always after the fir&s;t in rank, and not the mother of the elde&s;t &s;on, as other writers would make us believe. Sometimes the Sultan diverts him&s;elf in the company of all his ladies who &s;tand in a circle round him. And &s;he confe&s;&s;ed, they were ready to die with envy and jea|lou&s;y of the <HI>happy &s;he,</HI> that he di&s;tingu&s;hed by any appearance of preference. But this &s;eemed to me neither better nor wor&s;e than the circles in mo&s;t courts, where the glance of the monarch is watched, and every &s;mile is waited for with impatience, and envied by tho&s;e who cannot obtain it.</P>
<P>She never mentioned the Sultan without tears in her eyes, yet &s;he &s;eemed very fond of the di&s;cour&s;e. <Q>My pa&s;t happine&s;s, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> appears a dream to me. Yet I cannot forget that I was beloved by the greate&s;t and mo&s;t lovely of mankind. I was cho&s;en from all the re&s;t, to make all his campaigns with him; and I would not &s;urvive him, if I was not pa&s;&s;ionately fond of the Prince&s;s my daughter. Yet all my tenderne&s;s for her was hardly enough to make me pre&s;erve my life. When I left him, I pa&s;&s;ed a whole twelve-month without &s;eeing the light. Time has &s;oftened my de&s;pair; yet I now pa&s;s &s;ome days every week in tears, devoted to the memory of my Sultan.</Q> There was no affectation in the&s;e words. It was ea&s;y to &s;ee &s;he was in a deep melancholy, though her good humour made her will|ing to divert me.</P>
<P>She a&s;ked me to walk in her garden, and one of her &s;laves immediately brought her a <HI>Pellice</HI> of rich brocade lined with &s;ables. I waited on her into the garden, which had nothing in it remarkable but the fountains; and from thence, &s;he &s;hewed me all her
<PB N="142" REF="041644_0151_101AD2A8793B69B8">
apartments. In her bed-chamber, her toilet was di&s;|played, con&s;i&s;ting of two looking gla&s;&s;es, the frames covered with pearls, and her night <HI>Talpoche</HI> &s;et with bodkins of jewels, and near it three ve&s;ts of fine fables, every one of which is at lea&s;t worth a thou&s;and dol|lars (two hundred pounds Engli&s;h money.) I don't doubt but the&s;e rich habits were purpo&s;ely placed in &s;ight, though they &s;eemed negligently thrown on the Sofa. When I took my leave of her, I was com|plimented with perfumes as at the Grand Vizier's, and pre&s;ented with a very fine embroidered handker|chief. Her &s;laves were to the number of thirty, be&s;ides ten little ones, the elde&s;t not above &s;even years old. The&s;e were the mo&s;t beautiful girls I ever &s;aw, all richly dre&s;&s;ed; and I ob&s;erved that the Sultana took a great deal of plea&s;ure in the&s;e lovely children, which is a va&s;t expence; for there is not a hand&s;ome girl of that age, to be bought under a hundred pounds &s;terling. They wore little garlands of flowers, and their own hair, braided, which was all their head-dre&s;s; but their habits were all of gold &s;tuffs. The&s;e &s;erved her coffee kneeling; brought water when &s;he wa&s;hed, &amp;c.&mdash;'Tis a great part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the older &s;laves to take care of the&s;e young girls, to learn them to embroider, and to &s;erve them as carefully as if they were children of the family. Now do you imagine I have entertained you, all this while, with a relation that has, at lea&s;t, received many embelli&s;hments from my hand? This, you will &s;ay, is but too like the Arabian Tales&mdash;The&s;e embroidered napkins! and a jewel as large as a turkey's egg?&mdash;You forget, dear &s;i&s;ter, tho&s;e very tales were written by an author of this country, and (excepting the enchantments) are a real repre&s;en|tation of the manners here. We travellers are in
<PB N="143" REF="041644_0152_101AD2AA0456C760">
very hard circum&s;tances. If we &s;ay nothing but what has been &s;aid before us, <HI>we are dull, and we have ob&s;erved nothing.</HI> If we tell any thing new, we are laughed at as <HI>fabulous and romantic,</HI> not allowing either for the difference of ranks, which afford diffe|rence of company, or more curio&s;ity, or the change of cu&s;toms that happen every twenty years in every country. But the truth is, people judge of travellers, exactly with the &s;ame candour, good nature, and im|partiality, they judge of their neighbours upon all occa&s;ions. For my part, if I live to return among&s;t you, I am &s;o well acquainted with the morals of all my dear friends and acquaintances, that I am re&s;olved to tell them nothing at all, to avoid the imputation (which their charity would certainly incline them to) of my telling too much. But I depend upon your knowing me enough, to believe whatever I &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;ert for truth; though I give you leave to be &s;ur|pri&s;ed at an account &s;o new to you. But what would you &s;ay, if I told you, that I have been in a <HI>Haram,</HI> where the winter apartment was wain&s;cotted with inlaid work of mother of pearl, ivory of different co|lours, and olive wood, exactly like the little boxes, you have &s;een brought out of this country; and in who&s;e rooms de&s;igned for &s;ummer, the walls are all cru&s;ted with Japan china, the roofs gilt, and the floors &s;pread with the fine&s;t Per&s;ian carpets? Yet there is nothing more true; &s;uch is the palace of my lovely friend, the fair <HI>Fatima,</HI> whom I was acquainted with at <HI>Adrianople.</HI> I went to vi&s;it her ye&s;terday; and if po&s;&s;ible, &s;he appeared to me hand&s;omer than before. She met me at the door of her chamber, and, giving me her hand with the be&s;t grace in the world; You Chri&s;tian ladies (&s;aid &s;he with a &s;mile, that made her as beautiful as an angel) have the re|putation
<PB N="144" REF="041644_0153_101AD2AC70D7B150">
of incon&s;tancy, and I did not expect, what|ever goodne&s;s you expre&s;&s;ed for me at Adrianople, that I &s;hould ever &s;ee you again. But I am now con|vinced that I have really the happine&s;s of plea&s;ing you; and if you knew how I &s;peak of you among&s;t our ladies, you would be a&s;&s;ured, that you do me ju&s;tice in making me your friend. She placed me in the corner of the Sofa, and I &s;pent the afternoon in her conver&s;ation, with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure in the world.&mdash;The Sultana <HI>Hafifien,</HI> is what one would naturally expect to find a Turki&s;h lady, willing to oblige, but not knowing how to go about it; and 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee in her manner, that &s;he has lived excluded from the world. But <HI>Fatima</HI> has all the politene&s;s and good breeding of a court, with an air that in&s;pires at once, re&s;pect and tenderne&s;s; and now that I under&s;tand her language, I find her wit as agreeable as her beauty. She is very curious after the manners of other countries, and has not the partiality for her own, &s;o common to little minds. A Greek that I carried with me, who had never &s;een her before (nor could have been admitted now, if &s;he had not been admitted in my train) &s;hewed that &s;urpri&s;e at her beauty and manner, which is una|voidable at the fir&s;t, &s;ight, and &s;aid to me in Italian,&mdash;<HI>"This is no Turki&s;h lady, &s;he is certainly &s;ome Chri&s;tian."&mdash;Fatima</HI> gue&s;&s;ed &s;he &s;poke of her, and a&s;ked what &s;he &s;aid; I would not have told her, thinking &s;he would have been no better plea&s;ed with the compliment, than one of our court beauties to be told, &s;he had the air of a Turk. But the Greek lady told it to her, and &s;he &s;miled, &s;aying, <HI>It is not the fir&s;t time I have heard &s;o; my mother was a Polozene taken at the &s;iege of Caminiec; and my father u&s;ed to rally me, &s;ay|ing, he believed his Chri&s;tian wife had found &s;ome

Chri&s;tian gallant; for that I had not the air of a Turk|i&s;h girl.</HI>&mdash;I a&s;&s;ured her, that if all the Turki&s;h ladies were like her, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to confine them from public view for the repo&s;e of mankind; and proceeded to tell her, what a noi&s;e &s;uch a face as hers would make in London or Paris. <HI>I can't believe you,</HI> replied &s;he agreeably; <HI>if beauty was &s;o much valued in your country, as you &s;ay, they would never have &s;uffered you to leave it.</HI>&mdash;Perhaps, dear &s;i&s;ter, you laugh at my vanity in repeating this compliment, but I only do it, as I think it very well turned, and give it you as an in&s;tance of the &s;pirit of her conver&s;ation. Her hou&s;e was magnificently furni&s;hed, and very well fancied; her winter rooms being furni&s;hed with figured velvet on gold grounds, and, tho&s;e for &s;ummer, with fine Indian quilting em|broidered with gold. The hou&s;es of the great Tur|ki&s;h ladies are kept clean with as much nicety as tho&s;e in Holland. This was &s;ituated in a high part of the town; and from the window of her &s;ummer apartment we had the pro&s;pect of the &s;ea, the i&s;lands and the A&s;ian mountains,&mdash;My letter is in&s;en&s;i|bly grown &s;o long, I am a&s;hamed of it. This is a very bad &s;ymptom. 'Tis well if I don't dege|nerate into a down right &s;tory-teller. It may be, our proverb, that <HI>knowledge is no burden,</HI> may be true, as to one's &s;elf; but knowing too much, is very apt to make us trouble&s;ome to other people.</P>

<P>I AM extremely plea&s;ed, my dear lady, that you have, at length, found a commi&s;&s;ion for me, that I can an&s;wer without di&s;appointing your expectations; though I mu&s;t tell you, that it is not &s;o ea&s;y as per|haps you think it; and that, if my curio&s;ity had not been more diligent than any other &s;tranger's has ever yet been, I mu&s;t have an&s;wered you with an excu&s;e, as I was forced to do, when you de&s;ired me to buy you a Greek &s;lave. I have got for you, as you de&s;ire, a Turki&s;h love-letter, which I have put into a little box, and ordered the captain of the <HI>Smyrniote</HI> to deliver it to you with this letter. The tran&s;lation of it is lite|rally as follows: The fir&s;t piece you &s;hould pull out of the pur&s;e, is a little Pearl, which is in Turki&s;h cal|led <HI>Ingi,</HI> and mu&s;t be under&s;tood in this manner:</P>

You &s;ee this letter is all in ver&s;e, and I can a&s;&s;ure you, there is as much fancy &s;hewn in the choice of them, as in the mo&s;t &s;tudied expre&s;&s;ions, of our let|ters; there being, I believe, a million of ver&s;es de|&s;igned for this u&s;e.

<HEAD>LETTER XLI. To the Counte&s;s of B&mdash;.</HEAD>
<P>AT length I have heard from my dear lady B&mdash;, for the fir&s;t time. I am per&s;uaded you have had the goodne&s;s to write before, but I have had the ill fortune to lo&s;e your letters. Since my la&s;t, I have &s;tayed quietly at Con&s;tantinople, a city that I ought in con&s;cience to give your lady&s;hip a right notion of, &s;ince I know you can have none but what is partial and mi&s;taken from the writings of travellers. 'Tis certain, there are many people that pa&s;s years here in <HI>Pera,</HI> without having ever &s;een it, and yet they all pretend to de&s;cribe it, <HI>Tophana,</HI> and <HI>Galata,</HI> wholly inhabited by French-Chri&s;tians (and which, together, make the appearance of a very fine town) are divided from it by the &s;ea, which is not above half &s;o broad as the broade&s;t part of the Thames; but the Chri&s;|tian men are loath to hazard the adventures they &s;ometimes meet with among&s;t the <HI>Levents</HI> or Seamen (wor&s;e mon&s;ters than our watermen) and the women mu&s;t cover their faces to go there, which they have &aacute; perfect aver&s;ion to do. 'Tis true, they wear veils in Pera, but they are &s;uch as only &s;erve to &s;hew their beauty to more advantage, and would not be permitted in Con&s;tantinople. The&s;e rea&s;ons deter almo&s;t every creature from &s;eeing it; and the French Amba&s;&s;adre&s;s will return to France (I believe) with|out ever having been there. You'll wonder, madam, to hear me add, that I have been there very often. The <HI>A&s;mack,</HI> or Turki&s;h veil, is become not only very ea&s;y, but agreeable to me; and if it was not, I would be content to endure &s;ome inconveniency to
<PB N="151" REF="041644_0160_101AD2BEB2E54818">
gratify a pa&s;&s;ion that is become &s;o powerful with me, as curio&s;ity. And indeed, the plea&s;ure of going in a barge to Chel&s;ea, is not comparable to that of rowing upon the canal of the &s;ea here, where for twenty miles together down the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> the mo&s;t beautiful variety of pro&s;pects pre&s;ent them&s;elves. The A&s;ian &s;ide is covered with fruit trees, villages, and the mo&s;t delightful land&s;kips in nature; on the European, &s;tands Con&s;tantinople, &s;ituated on &s;even hills.&mdash;The unequal heights make it &s;eem as large again as it is (tho' one of the large&s;t cities in the world) &s;hewing an agreeable mixture of gardens, pine and cypre&s;s trees, palaces, mo&s;ques, and public buildings, rai&s;ed one above another, with as much beauty and appearance of &s;ymmetry as your lady&s;hip ever &s;aw in a cabinet adorned by the mo&s;t &s;kilful hands, where jars &s;hew them&s;elves above jars, mixed with cani&s;ters, babies, and candle&s;ticks. This is a very odd compari&s;on; but it gives me an exact idea of the thing. I have taken care to &s;ee as much of the Seraglio as is to be &s;een. It is on a point of land running into the &s;ea; a palace of prodigious extent, but very irregular. The gardens take in a large compa&s;s of ground, full of high cypre&s;s trees, which is all I know of them. The buildings are all of white &s;tone, headed on top, with gilded turrets and &s;pires, which look very magnificent; and indeed, I believe there is no Chri&s;tian King's palace half &s;o large. There are &s;ix large courts in it, all built round and &s;et with trees, having galleries of &s;tone; one of tho&s;e for the guard, another for the &s;laves, another for the officers of the kitchen, another for the &s;tables, the fifth for the Divan, and the &s;ixth for the apartment de&s;tined for audiences. On the ladies &s;ide there are, at lea&s;t, as many more, with
<PB N="152" REF="041644_0161_101AD2C0F07FFC30">
di&s;tinct courts belonging to their eunuchs and atten|dants, their kitchens, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The next remarkable &s;tructure is that of St. <HI>Sophia,</HI> which 'tis very difficult to &s;ee. I was forced to &s;end three times to the <HI>Caimaicam,</HI> (the Governor of the Town) and he a&s;&s;embled the chief <HI>Effendi'</HI>s or heads of the law, and inquired of the <HI>Mufti,</HI> whether it was lawful to permit it. They pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome days in this important debate; but, I in&s;i&s;ting on my reque&s;t, permi&s;&s;ion was granted. I can't be informed why the Turks are more delicate on the &s;ubject of this Mo&s;que, than on any of the others, where, what Chri&s;tian plea&s;es may enter without &s;cruple. I fancy they imagine that, having been once con&s;ecrated, peo|ple, on pretence of curio&s;ity, might profane it with prayers, particularly to tho&s;e Saints, who are &s;till very vi&s;ible in Mo&s;iaic work, and no other way defaced but by the decays of time; for it is ab&s;o|lutely fal&s;e tho' &s;o univer&s;ally a&s;&s;erted, that the Turks defaced all the images that they found in the city. The dome of St. <HI>Sophia</HI> is &s;aid to be one hun|dred and thirteen foot diameter, built upon arches, &s;u&s;tained by va&s;t pillars of marble, the pavement and &s;tair-ca&s;e marble. There are two rows of galleries &s;upported with pillars of parti-coloured marble and the whole roof mo&s;aic work, part of which decays very fa&s;t, and drops down. They pre&s;ented me a handful of it; the compo&s;ition &s;eems to me a &s;ort of gla&s;s, or that pa&s;te with which they make counter|feit jewels. They &s;hew here the tomb of the Empe|ror <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> for which they have a great veneration.</P>
<P>This is a dull imperfect de&s;cription of this celebra|ted building; but I under&s;tand architecture &s;o little, that I am afraid of talking non&s;en&s;e in endeavouring to &s;peak of it particularly. Perhaps I am in the
<PB N="153" REF="041644_0162_101AD2C33B062350">
wrong, but &s;ome Turki&s;h Mo&s;ques plea&s;e me better. That of Sultan <HI>Solyman</HI> is an exact &s;quare, with four fine towers in the angles; in the mid&s;t is a noble <HI>Cupola</HI> &s;upported with beautiful marble pillars; two le&s;&s;er at the ends, &s;upported in the &s;ame manner; the pavement and gallery round the Mo&s;que, of marble; under the great cupola is a fountain adorned with &s;uch fine coloured pillars, that I can hardly think them natural marble; on the one &s;ide is the pulpit of white marble, and on the other the little gallery for the Grand Signior. A fine &s;tair-ca&s;e leads to it, and it is built up with gilded lattices. At the upper end is a &s;ort of altar, where the name of God is written; and, before it, &s;tand two candle|&s;ticks, as high as a man, with wax candles as thick as three flambeaux. The pavement is &s;pread with fine carpets, and the Mo&s;que illuminated with a va&s;t num|ber of lamps. The court leading to it is very &s;pa|cious, with galleries of marble of green columns, covered with twenty-eight leaded cupola's on two &s;ides, and a fine fountain of ba&s;ons in the mid&s;t of it.</P>
<P>This de&s;cription may &s;erve for all the Mo&s;ques in Con&s;tantinople. The model is exactly the &s;ame, and they only differ in largene&s;s and richne&s;s of materials. That of the Sultana VALIDA is the large&s;t of all, built entirely of marble, the mo&s;t prodigious, and I think the mo&s;t beautiful &s;tructure I ever &s;aw, be it &s;poke to the honour of our &s;ex, for it was founded by the mother of MAHOMET the fourth. Between friends, <HI>Paul's Church</HI> would make a pitiful figure near it; as any of our &s;quares would do, near the <HI>Atlerdan,</HI> or place of hor&s;es, (<HI>at</HI> &s;ignifying a hor&s;e in Turki&s;h.) This was the <HI>Hippodrome,</HI> in the reign of the Greek Emperors. In the mid&s;t of it is a brazen column of three &s;erpents twi&s;ted together,
<PB N="154" REF="041644_0163_101AD2C577BF7048">
with their mouths gaping. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to learn why &s;o odd a pillar was erected; the Greeks can tell nothing but fabulous legends when they are a&s;ked the meaning of it, and there is no &s;ign of its having ever had any in&s;cription. At the upper end is an obeli&s;k of porphyry, probably brought from Egypt, the hieroglyphicks all very entire, which I look upon as mere antient puns. It is placed on four lit|tle brazen pillars, upon a pede&s;tal of &s;quare free &s;tone, full of figures in bas-relief on two &s;ides; one &s;quare repre&s;enting a battle, another an a&s;&s;embly. The others having in&s;criptions in Greek and Latin; the la&s;t I took in my pocket-book, and it is as follows.
<Q><L><HI>Difficilis quondam, Dominis parere Serenis</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ju&s;&s;us, et extinctis palmam portare Tyrannis</HI></L>
<L><HI>Omnia Theodo&s;io cedunt, &s;obolique perenni.</HI></L></Q>
Your Lord will interpret the&s;e lines. Don't fancy they they are a love-letter to him.</P>
<P>All the figures have their heads on; and I cannot forbear reflecting again on the impudence of authors, who all &s;ay they have not; but I dare &s;wear the greate&s;t part of them never &s;aw them; but took the report from the Greeks, who re&s;i&s;t, with incredible fortitude, the conviction of their own eyes, whenever they have invented lies to the di&s;honour of their enemies. Were you to believe them, there is no|thing worth &s;eeing in Con&s;tantinople, but <HI>Sancta Sohpia,</HI> tho' there are &s;everal larger, and in my opi|nion, more beautiful Mo&s;ques in that city. That of Sultan <HI>Achmet,</HI> has this particularity, that its gates are of bra&s;s. In all the&s;e Mo&s;ques there are little chapels, where are the tombs of the founders and their families, with wax candles burning before them.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="041644_0164_101AD2C7D2396BA8">
The <HI>Exchanges</HI> are all noble buildings, full of fine alleys, the greate&s;t part &s;upported with pillars, and kept wonderfully neat. Every trade has its di&s;tinct alley, where the merchandize is di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;ame order as in the New Exchange at London. The <HI>Bi&s;i&s;ten,</HI> or jeweller's quarter, &s;hews &s;o much riches, &s;uch a va&s;t quantity of diamonds, and all kinds of precious &s;tones, that they dazzle the &s;ight. The embroiderers is al&s;o very glittering, and people walk here as much for diver&s;ion as bu&s;ine&s;s. The markets are mo&s;t of them hand&s;ome &s;quares, and admirably well provided, perhaps better than in any other part of the world.</P>
<P>I know you'll expect I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething par|ticular of the &s;laves; and you will imagine me half a Turk, when I don't &s;peak of it with the &s;ame horror other Chri&s;tians have done before me. But I cannot forbear applauding the humanity of the Turks to the&s;e creatures; they are never ill u&s;ed, and their &s;lavery is in my opinion, no wor&s;e than &s;ervitude all over the world. 'Tis true they have no wages; but they give them yearly clothes to a higher value than our &s;alaries to our ordinary &s;ervants. But you'll ob|ject, that men buy women <HI>with an eye to evil.</HI> In my opinion they are bought and &s;old as publicly and as infamou&s;ly in all our Chri&s;tian great cities.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t add to the de&s;cription of Con&s;tantinople, that the <HI>Hi&s;torical Pillar</HI> is no more. It dropped down about two years before I came to this part of the world. I have &s;een no other foot&s;teps of anti|quity except the aquaeducts, which are &s;o va&s;t, that I am apt to believe they are yet more antient than the Greek Empire. The Turks, indeed, have clap|ped in &s;ome &s;tones with Turki&s;h in&s;criptions, to give their natives the honour of &s;o great a work; but the
<PB N="156" REF="041644_0165_101AD2CA08D68AF0">
deceit is ea&s;ily di&s;covered.&mdash;The other public build|ings are the <HI>Hans</HI> and <HI>Mona&s;teries;</HI> the fir&s;t are very large and numerous; the &s;econd few in number, and not at all magnificent. I had the curio&s;ity to vi&s;it one of them, and to ob&s;erve the devotions of the <HI>Dervi&s;es,</HI> which are as whim&s;ical as any at Rome. The&s;e fellows have permi&s;&s;ion to marry, but are con|fined to an odd habit, which is only a piece of coar&s;e white cloath, wrapped about them, with their legs and arms naked. Their order has few other rules, except that of performing their fanta&s;tick rites, every Tue&s;day and Friday, which is done in this manner: They meet together in a large hall, where they all &s;tand with their eyes fixed on the ground, and their arms acro&s;s, while the <HI>Imaum</HI> or preacher reads part of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> from a pulpit, placed in the mid&s;t; and when he has done, eight or ten of them make a melancholy concert with their pipes, which are no unmu&s;ical in&s;truments. Then he reads again, and makes a &s;hort expo&s;ition on what he has read; after which they &s;ing and play, till their Superior (the only one of them dre&s;&s;ed in green) ri&s;es and begins a &s;ort of &s;olemn dance. They all &s;tand about him in a regular figure, and while &s;ome play, the others tie their robe (which is very wide) fa&s;t round their wai&s;t, and begin to turn round with an amazing &s;wiftne&s;s, and yet with great regard to the mu&s;ic, moving &s;lower or fa&s;ter as the tune is played. This la&s;ts above an hour, without any of them &s;hewing the lea&s;t appear|ance of giddine&s;s, which is not to be wondered at, when it is con&s;idered, they are all u&s;ed to it from their infancy; mo&s;t of them being devoted to this way of life from their birth. There turned among&s;t them &s;ome little Dervi&s;es of &s;ix or &s;even years old, who &s;eemed no more di&s;ordered by that exerci&s;e than
<PB N="157" REF="041644_0166_101AD2CCE8AD9300">
the others. At the end of the ceremony they &s;hout out; <HI><Q>There is no other God, but God, and Mahomet is his Prophet:</Q></HI> after which they ki&s;s the Superor's hand and retire. The whole is performed with the mo&s;t &s;olemn gravity. Nothing can be more au&s;tere than the form of the&s;e people; they never rai&s;e their eyes, and &s;eem devoted to contemplation. And as ridiculous as this is in de&s;cription, there is &s;omething touching in the air of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and mortification they a&s;&s;ume.&mdash;This letter is of a horrible length; but you may burn it when you have read enough, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>I AM now preparing to leave Con&s;tantinople, and perhaps you will accu&s;e me of hypocri&s;y, when I tell you, 'tis with regret; but as I am u&s;ed to the air, and have learnt the language, I am ea&s;y here; and as much as I love travelling, I tremble at the inconveniencies attending &s;o great a journey, with a numerous family, and a little infant hanging at the brea&s;t. However, I endeavour, upon this occa&s;ion, to do as I have hitherto done in all the odd turns of my life; turn them, if I can, to my diver&s;ion. In order to this, I ramble every day, wrapped up in my <HI>Ferige</HI> and <HI>A&s;mack,</HI> about Con&s;tantinople, and amu&s;e my&s;elf with &s;eeing all that is curious in it.

To what purpo&s;e &s;hould I tell you, that Con&s;tantinople is the antient Bizantium? that 'tis at pre&s;ent the conque&s;t of a race of people, &s;up|po&s;ed Seythians? that there are five or &s;ix thou&s;and mo&s;ques in it? that <HI>Sancta Sophia</HI> was founded by Ju&s;|tinian, &amp;c. I'll a&s;&s;ure you 'tis not for want of learn|ing, that I forbear writing all the&s;e bright things. I could al&s;o, with very little trouble, turn over <HI>Knolles</HI> and Sir <HI>Paul Rycaut,</HI> to give you a li&s;t of Turki&s;h Emperors; but I will not tell you what you may find in every author that has writ of this country. I am more inclined, out of a true female &s;pirit of contra|diction, to tell you the fal&s;ehood of a great part of what you find in authors; as for example, in the admirable Mr. <HI>Hill,</HI> who &s;o gravely a&s;&s;erts, that he &s;aw in <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> a &s;weating pillar, very bal&s;amic for di&s;ordered heads. There is not the lea&s;t tradi|tion of any &s;uch matter; and I &s;uppo&s;e it was revealed to him in vi&s;ion, during his wonderful &s;tay in the Egyptian Catacombs; for I am &s;ure he never heard of any &s;uch miracle here. 'Tis al&s;o very plea&s;ant to ob&s;erve how tenderly he and all his brethren voyage-writers, lament the mi&s;erable confinement of the Turki&s;h ladies, who are perhaps more free than any ladies in the univer&s;e, and are the only women in the world, that lead a life of uninterrupted plea|&s;ure, exempt from cares, their whole time being &s;pent in vi&s;iting, bathing, or the agreeable amu&s;e|ment of &s;pending money and inventing new fa&s;hions. A husband would be thought mad that exacted any degree of oeconomy from his wife, who&s;e expences are no way limited but by her own fancy. 'Tis his bu&s;ine&s;s to get money, and her's to &s;pend it; and this noble prerogative extends it&s;elf to the very meane&s;t of the &s;ex. Here is a fellow that carries embroidered
<PB N="159" REF="041644_0168_101AD2D0A8857190">
handkerchiefs upon his back to &s;ell. And as mi&s;e|rable a figure as you may &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a mean dealer; yet I'll a&s;&s;ure you, his wife &s;corns to wear any thing le&s;s than cloth of gold; has her ermine furs, and a very hand&s;ome &s;et of jewels for her head. 'Tis true, they have no places but the bagnios, and the&s;e can only be &s;een by their own &s;ex; however, that is a diver&s;ion they take great plea&s;ure in.</P>
<P>I was, three days ago, at one of the fine&s;t in the town, and had the opportunity of &s;eeing a Turki&s;h bride received there, and all the ceremony u&s;ed on that occa&s;ion, which made me recollect the <HI>Epithala|mium</HI> of <HI>Helen,</HI> by <HI>Theocritus;</HI> and it &s;eems to me, that the &s;ame cu&s;toms have continued ever &s;ince. All the &s;he friends, relations and acquaintance of the two families, newly allied, meet at the bagnio; &s;everal others go, out of curio&s;ity, and I believe there were that day two hundred women. Tho&s;e that were, or had been married, placed them&s;elves round the rooms, on the marble &s;ofas; but the virgins very ha&s;tily threw off their clothes, and appeared without other ornament, or covering, than their own long hair braided with pearl or ribbon. Two of them met the bride at the door, conducted by her mother and ano|ther grave relation. She was a beautiful maid of about &s;eventeen, very richly dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;hining with jewels, but was pre&s;ently reduced to the &s;tate of nature. Two others filled &s;ilver gilt pots with perfume, and begun the proce&s;&s;ion, the re&s;t follow|ing in pairs, to the number of thirty. The leaders &s;ung an <HI>Epithalamium,</HI> an&s;wered by the others in chorus, and the two la&s;t led the fair bride, her eyes fixed on the ground, with a charming affectation of mode&s;ty. In this order they marched round the three large rooms of the Bagnio. 'Tis not ea&s;y to
<PB N="160" REF="041644_0169_101AD2D5F2B2AB10">
repre&s;ent to you the beauty of this &s;ight, mo&s;t of them being well proportioned and white &s;kinn'd; all of them perfectly &s;mooth, and poli&s;hed by the fre|quent u&s;e of bathing. After having made their <HI>tour,</HI> the bride was again led to every matron round the rooms, who &s;aluted her with a compliment and a pre&s;ent, &s;ome of jewels, others of pieces of &s;tuff, handkerchiefs, or little gallantries of that nature, which &s;he thanked them for, by ki&s;&s;ing their hands. I was very well plea&s;ed with having &s;een this cere|mony; and you may believe me, that the Turki&s;h ladies have, at lea&s;t, as much wit and civility, nay liberty, as among us. 'Tis true, the &s;ame cu&s;toms that give them &s;o many opportunities of gratifying their evil inclinations (if they have any) al&s;o put it very fully in the power of their husbands to revenge them&s;elves, if they are di&s;covered; and I do not doubt but they &s;uffer &s;ometimes for their indi&s;cretions in a very &s;evere manner. About two months ago, there was found at day-break, not very far from my hou&s;e, the bleeding body of a young woman, naked, only wrapp'd in a coar&s;e &s;heet, with two wounds of a knife, one in her &s;ide, and another in her brea&s;t. She was not quite cold, and was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly beau|tiful, that there was very few men in Pera, that did not go to look upon her; but it was not po&s;&s;ible for any body to know her, no woman's face being known. She was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been brought, in the dead of night, from the Con&s;tantinople &s;ide, and laid there. Very little inquiry was made about the murderer, and the corp&s;e was privately buried without noi&s;e. Murder is never pur&s;ued by the King's officers, as with us. 'Tis the bu&s;ine&s;s of the next relations to revenge the dead per&s;on; and if they like better to compound the matter for money

(as they generally do) there is no more &s;aid of it. One would imagine this defect in their government, &s;hould make &s;uch tragedies very frequent, yet they are extremely rare; which is enough to prove the people not naturally cruel. Neither do I think, in many other particulars, they de&s;erve the barbarous character we give them. I am well acquainted with a Chri&s;tian woman of quality, who made it her choice to live with a Turki&s;h husband, and is a very agree|able &s;en&s;ible lady. Her &s;tory is &s;o extraordinary, I cannot forbear relating it; but I promi&s;e you it &s;hall be in as few words as I can po&s;&s;ibly expre&s;s it.</P>
<P>She is a Spaniard, and was at Naples with her family, when that kingdom was part of the Spani&s;h dominion. Coming from thence in a <HI>Feloucca,</HI> accom|panied by her brother, they were attacked by the Turki&s;h Admiral, boarded and taken.&mdash;And now how &s;hall I mode&s;tly tell you the re&s;t of her adven|ture? The &s;ame accident happened to her, that happen'd to the fair Lucretia &s;o many years before her. But &s;he was too good a Chri&s;tian to kill her&s;elf, as that Heatheni&s;h Roman did. The Admiral was &s;o much charmed with the beauty, and <HI>long-&s;uffering</HI> of the fair captive, that, as his fir&s;t compliment, he gave immediate liberty to her brother and attendants, who made ha&s;te to Spain, and in a few months &s;ent the &s;um of four thou&s;and pound &s;terling, as a ran&s;om for his &s;i&s;ter. The Turk took the money, which he pre&s;ented to her, and told her &s;he was at liberty. But the lady very di&s;creetly weighed the different treatment &s;he was likely to find in her native country. Her relations (as the kinde&s;t thing they could do for her in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances) would certainly confine her to a nunnery for the re&s;t of her days.&mdash;Her Infidel lover was very hand&s;ome, very tender,
<PB N="162" REF="041644_0171_101AD2D9AA5FC740">
very fond of her, and lavi&s;hed at her feet all the Turki&s;h magnificence. She an&s;wered him very re&s;o|lutely, that her liberty was not &s;o precious to her as her honour, that he could no way re&s;tore that but by marrying her, and &s;he therefore de&s;ired him to ac|cept the ran&s;om as her portion, and give her the &s;atisfaction of knowing that no man could boa&s;t of her favours without being her husband. The admi|ral was tran&s;ported at this kind offer, and &s;ent back the money to her relations, &s;aying he was too happy in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He married her, and never took any other wife, and (as &s;he &s;ays her&s;elf) &s;he never had rea&s;on to repent the choice &s;he made. He left her &s;ome years after, one of the riche&s;t widows in Con&s;tantinople. But there is no remaining honour|ably a &s;ingle woman, and that con&s;ideration has obliged her to marry the pre&s;ent Captain Ba&s;&s;a (i. e. Admi|ral) his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.&mdash;I am afraid that you will think my friend fell in love with her ravi&s;her; but I am willing to take her word for it, that &s;he acted wholly on principles of honour, tho' I think &s;he might be rea&s;onably touched at his genero&s;ity, which is often found among&s;t the Turks of rank.</P>
<P>'Tis a degree of genero&s;ity to tell the truth, and 'tis very rare that any Turk will a&s;&s;ert a &s;olemn fal&s;e-hood. I don't &s;peak of the lowe&s;t &s;ort; for as there is a great deal of ignoronce, there is very little vir|tue among&s;t them; and fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es are much cheaper than in Chri&s;tendom, tho&s;e wretches not be|ing puni&s;hed (even when they are publicly detected) with the rigour they ought to be.</P>
<P>Now I am &s;peaking of their law, I don't know, whether I have ever mentioned to you one cu&s;tom peculiar to their country, I mean <HI>adoption,</HI> very com|mon among&s;t the Turks, and yet more among&s;t the
<PB N="163" REF="041644_0172_101AD2DEE55EECD0">
Greeks and Armenians. Not having it in their power to give their e&s;tates to a friend or a di&s;tant relation, to avoid its falling into the Grand Signior's trea&s;ury, when they are not likely to have any chil|dren of their own, they choo&s;e &s;ome pretty child of either &s;ex, among&s;t the meane&s;t people, and carry the child and its parents before the <HI>Cadi,</HI> and there declare they receive it for their heir. The parents, at the &s;ame time, renounce all future claim to it; a writing is drawn and witne&s;&s;ed, and a child thus adopted, cannot be di&s;inherited. Yet I have &s;een &s;ome common beggars, that have refu&s;ed to part with their children in this manner, to &s;ome of the riche&s;t among the Greeks; (&s;o powerful is the in&s;tinctive affection that is natural to parents!) though the adop|ting fathers are generally very tender to the&s;e <HI>chil|dren of their &s;ouls,</HI> as they call them. I own this cu&s;|tom plea&s;es me much better than our ab&s;urd one of following our name. Methinks 'tis much more rea|&s;onable to make happy and rich, an infant whom I educate after my own manner, <HI>brought up</HI> (in the Turki&s;h phra&s;e) <HI>upon my knees,</HI> and who has learnt to look upon me with a filial re&s;pect, than to give an e&s;tate to a creature without other merit or relation to me than that of a few letters. Yet this is an ab|&s;urdity we &s;ee frequently practi&s;ed.&mdash;Now I have mentioned the Armenians, perhaps it will be agreea|ble to tell you &s;omething of that nation, with which I am &s;ure you are utterly unacquainted. I will not trouble you with the geographical account of the &s;itu|ation of their country, which you may &s;ee in the maps; or a relation of their antient greatne&s;s, which you may read in the Roman Hi&s;tory. They are now &s;ubject to the Turks; and, being very indu&s;trious in trade, and increa&s;ing and multiplying, are di&s;per&s;ed
<PB N="164" REF="041644_0173_101AD2E1212A72B0">
in great numbers through all the Turki&s;h dominions. They were, as they &s;ay, converted to the Chri&s;tian religion by St. <HI>Gregory,</HI> and are perhaps the devoute&s;t Chri&s;tians in the whole world. The chief precepts of their prie&s;ts, enjoin the &s;trict keeping of their Lents, which are, at lea&s;t, &s;even months in every year, and are not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with on the mo&s;t emergent nece&s;&s;ity; no occa&s;ion whatever can excu&s;e them if they touch any thing more than mere herbs or roots, (without oil) and plain dry bread. That is their con&s;tant diet.&mdash;Mr. W&mdash;y has one of his interpreters of this nation, and the poor fellow was brought &s;o low by the &s;everity of his fa&s;ts, that his life was de&s;paired of. Yet neither his ma&s;ter's commands, nor the doctors intreaties (who declared nothing el&s;e could &s;ave his life) were powerful enough to prevail with him to take two or three &s;poonfuls of broth. Excepting this, which may rather be called a cu&s;tom than an article of faith, I &s;ee very little in their religion different from ours. 'Tis true, they &s;eem to incline very much to Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton'</HI>s doctrine; neither do I think the Greek church very di&s;tant from it, &s;ince 'tis certain, the Holy &s;pirit's proceding <HI>only</HI> from the father, is making a plain &s;ubordination in the Son.&mdash;But the Armenians have no notion of <HI>Tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation,</HI> whatever account Sir <HI>Paul Rycaut</HI> gives of them, (which account I am apt to believe was de|&s;igned to compliment our court in 1679) and they have a great horror for tho&s;e among&s;t them that change to the Roman religion. What is mo&s;t extra|ordinary in their cu&s;toms, is their matrimony; a cere|mony, I believe, unparallel'd all over the world. They are always promi&s;ed very young; but the e&s;|pou&s;ed never &s;ee one another, till three days after their marriage. The bride is carried to church with
<PB N="165" REF="041644_0174_101AD2E2A5B07BB8">
a cap on her head, in the fa&s;hion of a large trencher, and over it a red &s;ilken veil, which covers her all over to her feet. The prie&s;t a&s;ks the bridegroom whether he is contented to marry that woman, <HI>be &s;he deaf, be &s;he blind?</HI> The&s;e are the literal words; to which having an&s;wered <HI>yes,</HI> &s;he is led home to his hou&s;e, accompanied with all the friends and relations on both &s;ides, &s;inging and dancing, and is placed on a cu&s;hion in the corner of the &s;ofa; but her veil is never lifted up, not even by her husband. There is &s;omething &s;o odd and mon&s;trous in the&s;e ways, that I could not believe them till I had inquired of &s;everal Armenians my&s;elf, who all a&s;&s;ured me of the truth of them, par|ticularly one young fellow who wept when he &s;poke of it, being promi&s;ed by his mother to a girl that he mu&s;t marry in this manner, tho' he prote&s;ted to me, he had rather die than &s;ubmit to this &s;lavery, having already figured his bride to him&s;elf, with all the deformities in nature.&mdash;I fancy I &s;ee you ble&s;s your|&s;elf at this terrible relation. I cannot conclude my letter with a more &s;urpri&s;ing &s;tory, yet 'tis as &s;eriou&s;ly true, as that I am,</P>

<P>I AM extremely plea&s;ed with hearing from you, and my vanity (the darling frailty of human kind) not a little flattered by the uncommon que&s;tions you a&s;k me, tho' I am utterly incapable of an&s;wering them. And indeed were I as good Mathematician as <HI>Euclid</HI> him&s;elf, it requires an age's &s;tay to make ju&s;t ob&s;er|vations on the air and vapours. I have not been yet a full year here, and am on the point of removing. Such is my rambling de&s;tiny. This will &s;urpri&s;e you, and can &s;urpri&s;e nobody &s;o much as my&s;elf. Perhaps you will accu&s;e me of lazine&s;s or dulne&s;s, or both together, that can leave this place without giv|ing you &s;ome account of the Turki&s;h court. I can only tell you that if you plea&s;e to read Sir <HI>Paul Ry|caut,</HI> you will there find a full and true account of the <HI>Viziers,</HI> the <HI>Beglerby'</HI>s, the civil and &s;piritual go|vernment, the officers of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> &amp;c. things that 'tis very ea&s;y to procure li&s;ts of, and therefore may be depended on; tho' other &s;tories, God knows&mdash;I &s;ay no more&mdash;every body is at liberty to write their own remarks; the manners of people may change; or &s;ome of them e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of travellers; but 'tis not the &s;ame of the government, and for that rea&s;on, &s;ince I can tell you nothing new, I will tell you nothing of it. In the &s;ame &s;ilence &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed over the ar&s;enal and &s;even towers, and for Mo&s;ques I have already de&s;cribed one of the noble&s;t to you very particularly. But I cannot forbear tak|ing
<PB N="167" REF="041644_0176_101AD2EA4C37E630">
notice to you of a mi&s;take of GEMELLI, though I honour him in a much higher degree than any other voyage-writer:) he &s;ays that there are no remains of Calcedon; this is certainly a mi&s;take; I was there ye&s;terday and went cro&s;s the canal in my galley, the &s;ea being very narrow between that city and Con&s;tan|tinople. 'Tis &s;till a large town, and has &s;everal Mo&s;ques in it. The Chri&s;tians &s;till call it Calcedo|nia, and the Turks gave it a name I forgot, but which is only a corruption of the &s;ame word. I &s;up|po&s;e this is an error of his guide, which his &s;hort &s;tay hindered him from rectifying; for I have, in other matters, a very ju&s;t e&s;teem for his veracity. Nothing can be plea&s;anter than the canal, and the Turks are &s;o well acquainted with its beauties, that all their plea&s;ure-&s;eats are built on its banks, where they have, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t beautiful pro&s;|pects in Europe and A&s;ia; there are near one ano|ther, &s;ome hundreds of magnificent palaces. Human grandeur being here yet more un&s;table than any where el&s;e, 'tis common for the heirs of a great three|tail'd Ba&s;&s;a, not to be rich enough to keep in repair, the hou&s;e he built; thus in a few years they all fall to ruin. I was ye&s;terday to &s;ee that of the late Grand Vizier, who was killed at Peterwaradin. It was built to receive his Royal Bride, daughter of the pre&s;ent Sultan, but he did not live to &s;ee her there. I have a great mind to de&s;cribe it to you; but I check that inclination, knowing very well that I cannot give you, with my be&s;t de&s;cription, &s;uch an idea of it as I ought. It is &s;ituated on one of the mo&s;t delightful parts of the canal, with a fine wood on the &s;ide of a hill behind it. The extent of it is prodigious; the guardian a&s;&s;ured me there are eight hundred rooms in it; I will not, however, an&s;wer for that number,
<PB N="168" REF="041644_0177_101AD2EBCF520328">
&s;ince I did not count them; but 'tis certain the num|ber is very large, and the whole adorned with a pro|fu&s;ion of marble, gilding, and the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite painting of fruits and flowers. The windows are all fa&s;h'd with the fine&s;t chry&s;taline gla&s;s, brought from England, and here is all the expen&s;ive magnificence that you can &s;uppo&s;e in a palace founded by a vain luxurious young man, with the wealth of a va&s;t em|pire at his command. But no part of it plea&s;ed me better than the apartments de&s;tined for the Bagnio's. There are two built exactly in the &s;ame manner, an|&s;wering to one another; the baths, fountains, and pavements all of white marble, the roofs gilt, and the walls covered with Japan china. Adjoining to them are two rooms, the uppermo&s;t of which is divided into a &s;ofa; and in the four corners are falls of water from the very roof, from &s;hell to &s;hell of white mar|ble, to the lower end of the room, where it falls into a large ba&s;on, &s;urrounded with pipes that throw up the water as high as the room. The walls are in the nature of lattices, and on the out&s;ide of them, there are vines and woodbines planted, that form a kind of green tape&s;try, and give an agreeable ob&s;cu|rity to tho&s;e delightful chambers. I &s;hould go on and let you into &s;ome of the other apartments (all worthy your curio&s;ity) but 'tis yet harder to de&s;cribe a Turki&s;h palace than any other, being built entirely irregular. There is nothing that can be properly called front or wings; and tho' &s;uch a confu&s;ion is, I think, plea&s;ing to the &s;ight, yet it would be very unintelligible in a letter. I &s;hall only add, that the chamber de&s;tined for the Sultan when he vi&s;its his daughter, is wain&s;cotted with mother of pearl, fa&s;|tened with emeralds like nails. There are others of mother of pearl and olive-wood inlaid, and &s;everal
<PB N="169" REF="041644_0178_101AD28877CD85C0">
of Japan china. The galleries, which are numerous and very large, are adorned with jars of flowers, and procelain di&s;hes of fruit of all &s;orts, &s;o well done in plai&s;ter, and coloured in &s;o lively a manner, that it has an enchanting effect. The garden is &s;uitable to the hou&s;e, where arbours, fountains, and walks are thrown together in an agreeable confu&s;ion. There is no ornament wanting except that of &s;tatues. Thus you &s;ee, Sir, the&s;e people are not &s;o unpoli&s;hed as we repre&s;ent them. 'Tis true, their magnificence is of a different ta&s;te from ours, and perhaps of a better. I am almo&s;t of opinion they have a right notion of life. They con&s;ume it in mu&s;ick, gardens, wine and delicate eating, while we are tormenting our brains with &s;ome &s;cheme of politicks, or &s;tudying &s;ome &s;ci|ence to which we can never attain, or if we do, can|not per&s;uade other people to &s;et that value upon it we do our&s;elves. 'Tis certain what we feel and &s;ee is properly (if any thing is properly) our own; but the good of fame, the folly of prai&s;e are hardly pur|cha&s;ed, and when obtained, poor recompence for lo&s;s of time and health. We die or grow old before we can reap the fruit of our labours. Con&s;idering what &s;hort liv'd weak animals men are, is there any &s;tudy &s;o beneficial as the &s;tudy of pre&s;ent plea&s;ure? I dare not pur&s;ue this theme; perhaps I have already &s;aid too much, but I depend upon the true knowledge you have of my heart. I don't expect from you the in&s;ipid railleries I &s;hould &s;uffer from another in an&s;wer to this letter. You know how to divide the idea of <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> from that of <HI>vice,</HI> and they are only mingled in the heads of fools.&mdash;But I allow you to laugh at me for the &s;en&s;ual declaration in &s;aying, that I had rather be a rich Effendi with all his ignorance, than Sir I&s;aac Newton with all his knowledge.</P>

<P>I beg your pardon for this &s;ally, and will, if I can, continue the re&s;t of my account in plain pro&s;e. The &s;econd day after we &s;et &s;ail, we pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Gallipolis,</HI> a fair city, &s;ituated in the bay of <HI>Cher&s;one&s;us,</HI> and much re&s;pected by the Turks, being the fir&s;t town they took in Europe. At five the next morning, we an|chored in the Helle&s;pont, between the ca&s;tles of <HI>Se&s;tos</HI> and <HI>Abydos</HI> now called the <HI>Dardanelli.</HI> There are now two little ancient ca&s;tles, but of no &s;trength, being commanded by a ri&s;ing ground behind them, which I confe&s;s I &s;hould never have taken notice of, if I had not heard it ob&s;erv'd by our captain and officers, my imagination being wholly employed by the tragic &s;tory that you are well acquainted with:

<L><HI>The &s;wimming Lover and the nightly Bride,</HI></L>

Ver&s;e again!&mdash;I am certainly infected by the poetical air I have pa&s;&s;ed through. That of Abydos is un|doubtedly very amorous, &s;ince that &s;oft pa&s;&s;ion be|trayed the ca&s;tle into the hands of the Turks, who be&s;ieged it in the reign of Orchanes. The Gover|nor's daughter imagining to have &s;een her future husband in a dream (tho' I don't find &s;he had either &s;lept upon <HI>Bride-cake</HI> or kept <HI>St. Agnes Fa&s;t</HI>) fancied &s;he &s;aw the dear figure in the form of one of her be&s;iegers, and, being willing to obey her de&s;tiny, to&s;|&s;ed a note to him over the wall, with the offer of her per&s;on and the delivery of the ca&s;tle. He &s;hewed it to his general, who con&s;ented to try the &s;incerity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> her intentions and withdrew his army, ordering the young man to return with a &s;elect body of men at midnight. She admitted him at the appointed hour, he de&s;troyed the garri&s;on, took the father pri&s;oner, and made her his wife. This town is in A&s;ia, fir&s;t founded by the Mile&s;ians. <HI>Se&s;tos</HI> is in Europe, and was once the principal city of Cher&s;one&s;us. Since I have &s;een this &s;treight, I find nothing improbable in the adventure of <HI>Leander,</HI> or very wonderful in the bridge of boats of <HI>Xerxes.</HI> 'Tis &s;o narrow, 'tis not &s;urpri&s;ing a young lover &s;hould attempt to &s;wim, or an ambitious King try to pa&s;s his army over it. But then 'tis &s;o &s;ubject to &s;torms, 'tis no wonder the lover peri&s;hed and the bridge was broken. From hence we had a full view of mount Ida;

Not many leagues fail from hence, I &s;aw the point of land where poor old <HI>Hecuba</HI> was buried, and about a league from that place is Cape <HI>Janizary,</HI> the famous promontory of <HI>Sigaeum,</HI> where we anchored. My curio&s;ity &s;upplied me with &s;trength to climb to the top of it, to &s;ee the place where <HI>Achilles</HI> was buried, and where <HI>Alexander</HI> ran naked round his tomb in honour of him, which, no doubt, was a great com|fort to his gho&s;t. I &s;aw there, the ruins of a very large city, and found a &s;tone on which Mr. W&mdash;y plainly di&s;tingui&s;hed the words of <HI>Sigan Polin.</HI> We ordered this on board the &s;hip; but were &s;hew'd others much more curious by a Greek Prie&s;t, tho' a very ignorant fellow that could give no tolerable ac|count of any thing. On each &s;ide the door of this little church lie two large &s;tones, about ten feet long each, five in breadth and three in thickne&s;s. That on the right is very fine white marble, the &s;ide of it beautifully carved in <HI>Bas relief;</HI> it repre&s;ents a woman, who &s;eems to be de&s;igned for &s;ome Deity, &s;itting on a chair with a foot&s;tool, and before her another woman weeping and pre&s;enting to her a young child that &s;he has in her arms, followed by a proce&s;|&s;ion of women with children in the &s;ame manner. This is certainly part of a very ancient tomb; but I dare not pretend to give the true explanation of it. On the &s;tone, on the left &s;ide, is a very fair in&s;crip|tion, but the Greek is too ancient for Mr. W&mdash;y's interpretation. I am very &s;orry not to have the ori|ginal in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which might have been pur|cha&s;ed of the poor inhabitants for a &s;mall &s;um of money. But our captain a&s;&s;ured us, that, without having machines made on purpo&s;e, 'twas impo&s;&s;ible to bear it to the &s;ea-&s;ide, and when it was there, his long-boat would not be large enough to hold it.</P>

The ruins of this great city are now inhabited by poor Greek pea&s;ants, who wear the <HI>Sciote</HI> habit, the women being in &s;hort petticoats fa&s;tened by &s;traps round their &s;houlders, and large &s;mock-&s;leeves of white linen, with neat &s;hoes and &s;tockings, and on their heads a large piece of mu&s;lin, which falls in large folds on their &s;houlders.&mdash;One of my countrymen, Mr. <HI>Sands,</HI> (who&s;e book I doubt not you have read as one of the be&s;t of its kind) &s;peaking of the&s;e ruins &s;uppo&s;es them to have been the foundation of a city begun by Con&s;tantine, before his building Byzantium; but I &s;ee no good rea&s;on for that imagination, and am apt to believe them much more ancient.</P>
<P>We &s;aw very plainly from this promontory, the river <HI>Simois</HI> rolling from mount Ida, and running through a very &s;pacious valley. It is now a con&s;i|derable river and is called <HI>Simores;</HI> it is joined in the vale by the <HI>Scamander,</HI> which appeared a &s;mall &s;tream half-choaked with mud, but is perhaps large in the winter. This was <HI>Xanthus</HI> among&s;t the Gods, as Homer tells us, and 'tis by that heavenly name, the Nymph <HI>Oenone</HI> invokes it, in her Epi&s;tle to <HI>Paris.</HI> The Trojan Virgins u&s;ed to offer their fir&s;t favours to it by the name of Scamander, till the adventure, which <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Fontaine</HI> has told &s;o agreeably, aboli&s;hed that heatheni&s;h ceremony. When the &s;tream is mingled with the Simois, they run together to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>All that is now left at <HI>Troy</HI> is the ground on which it &s;tood; for I am firmly per&s;uaded whatever pieces of antiquity may be found round it, are much more modern, and I think <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;ays the &s;ame thing. However there is &s;ome plea&s;ure in &s;eeing the valley where I imagined the famous duel of <HI>Menelaus</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> had been fought, and where the greate&s;t city
<PB N="174" REF="041644_0183_101AD2DB2EFDF3F8">
in the world was &s;ituated. 'Tis certainly the noble&s;t &s;ituation that can be found for the head of a great empire, much to be preferred to that of Con&s;tanti|nople, the harbour here being always convenient for &s;hips from all parts of the world, and that of Con|&s;tantinople inacce&s;&s;ible almo&s;t &s;ix months in the year, while the north wind reigns.</P>
<P>North of the promontory of Sigaeum we &s;aw that of <HI>Rhateum,</HI> fam'd for the &s;epulchre of <HI>Ajax.</HI> While I viewed the&s;e celebrated fields and rivers I admired the exact geography of <HI>Homer,</HI> whom I had in my hand. Almo&s;t every epithet he gives to a mountain or plain, is &s;till ju&s;t for it; and I &s;pent &s;everal hours here, in as agreeable <HI>cogitations</HI> as ever <HI>Don Quixote</HI> had on mount <HI>Monte&s;inos.</HI> We failed next night, to the &s;hore where 'tis vulgarly reported <HI>Troy</HI> &s;tood, and I took the pains of ri&s;ing at two in the morning to view coolly tho&s;e ruins which are commonly &s;hew'd to &s;trangers, and which the Turks call <HI>E&s;ki-Stam|boul,</HI> i. e. Old Con&s;tantinople. For that rea&s;on as well as &s;ome others, I conjecture them to be the remains of that city begun by Con&s;tantine. I hired an a&s;s (the only voiture to be had there) that I might go &s;ome miles into the country, and take a tour round the ancient walls which are of a va&s;t extent. We found the remains of a ca&s;tle on a hill, and of ano|ther in a valley, &s;everal broken pillars and two pe|de&s;tals, from which I took the&s;e Latin in&s;criptions:

I do not doubt but the remains of a temple near this place, are the ruins of one dedicated to Augu&s;|tus, and I know not why Mr. <HI>Sands</HI> calls it a Chri&s;|tian temple, &s;ince the Romans certainly built herea|bouts. Here are many tombs of fine marble and va&s;t pieces of granate, which are daily le&s;&s;en'd by the prodigious balls that the Turks make, from them, for their cannon. We pa&s;&s;ed that evening the i&s;le of <HI>Tenedos,</HI> once under the patronage of APOLLO, as he gave it in, him&s;elf, in the particulars of his e&s;tate, when he courted <HI>Daphne.</HI> It is but ten miles in cir|cuit, but in tho&s;e days very rich and well peopled, &s;till famous for its excellent wine.

conque&s;t of Con&s;tantinople by the Turks. But need I talk to you of <HI>Catucu&s;eno,</HI> &amp;c. Princes that you are as well acquainted with as I am. 'Twas with regret I &s;aw us &s;ail from this i&s;land into the Egean &s;ea, now the Archipelago, leaving <HI>Scio</HI> (the ancient <HI>Chios</HI>) on the left, which is the riche&s;t and mo&s;t populous of the&s;e i&s;lands, fruitful in cotton, corn and &s;ilk, planted with groves of orange and lemon trees, and the Arvi|&s;ian mountain &s;till celebrated for the Nectar that VIR|GIL mentions. Here is the be&s;t manufacture of &s;ilks in all Turkey. The town is well built, the women famous for their beauty, and &s;hew their faces as in Chri&s;tendom. There are many rich families; tho' they confine their magnificence to the in&s;ide of their hou&s;es, to avoid the jealou&s;y of the Turks, who have a Ba&s;&s;a here; however they enjoy a rea&s;onable liberty, and indulge the genius of their country;
<Q><L><HI>And eat and &s;ing and dance away their time,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Fre&s;h as their groves and happy as their clime.</HI></L></Q>
Their chains hang lightly on them, tho' 'tis not long &s;ince they were impos'd, not being under the Turk till 1566. But perhaps 'tis as ea&s;y to obey the Grand Signior as the &s;tate of Genoa, to whom they were &s;old by the Greek Emperor. But I forgot my&s;elf in the&s;e hi&s;torical touches, which are very impertinent when I write to you.

This venerable &s;ight made me think with double regret, on a beautiful temple of THESEUS, which I am a&s;&s;ured was almo&s;t entire at Athens till the la&s;t campaign in the <HI>Morea,</HI> that the

You may believe I had a great mind to land on the fam'd <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> tho' it were only to look on the rivers of <HI>A&s;opus, Peneus, Inachus</HI> and <HI>Eurotas,</HI> the fields of <HI>Arcadia</HI> and other &s;cenes of an|cient Mythology. But in&s;tead of Demi-gods and He|roes, I was credibly informed, 'tis now over-run by robbers, and that I &s;hould run a great ri&s;que of fal|ling into their hands by undertaking &s;uch a journey through a de&s;art country, for which however I have &s;o much re&s;pect, that I have much ado to hin|der my&s;elf from troubling you with its whole hi&s;|tory, from the foundation of Nycana and Corinth, to the la&s;t campaign here; but I check the inclination as I did that of landing. We failed quietly by <HI>Cape Angelo,</HI> once <HI>Malea,</HI> where I &s;aw no remains of the famous temple of Apollo.

At <HI>Tunis</HI> we were met by the En|gli&s;h con&s;ul who re&s;ides here.

longer, if art is not made u&s;e of to pull them down. Soon after day-break I arrived at Tunis, a town fairly built of very white &s;tone, but quite without gardens, which, they &s;ay, were all de&s;troyed when the Turks fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ok it, none having been planted &s;ince. The dry &s;and gives a very di&s;agreeable pro&s;pect to the eye, and the want of &s;hade contributing to the natu|ral heat of the climate, renders it &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that I have much to do to &s;upport it. 'Tis true, here is every noon the refre&s;hment of the &s;ea-breeze, with|out which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to live; but no fre&s;h water, but what is pre&s;erved in the ci&s;terns, of the rains that fall in the month of September. The women of the town go veiled from head to foot under a black crape, and being mix'd with a breed of renegadoes are &s;aid to be many of them fair and hand&s;ome. This city was be&s;ieg'd in 1270 by LEWIS king of France, who died, under the walls of it, of a pe&s;tilential fe|ver. After his death PHILIP, his &s;on, and our prince EDWARD, &s;on of Henry the IIId, rai&s;ed the &s;iege on honourable terms. It remained under its natural Afri|can kings, till betrayed into the hands of BARBA|ROSSA, admiral of SOLYMAN the Magnificent. The Emperor Charles V. expelled Barbaro&s;&s;a, but it was recovered by the Turk under the conduct of <HI>Sinan Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> in the reign of SELIM II. From that time till now, it has remained tributary to the Grand Signior, governed by a Bey, who &s;uffers the name of &s;ubject to the Turk, but has renounced the &s;ubjection, be|ing ab&s;olute and very &s;eldom paying any tribute.

I went very early ye&s;terday morning (after one night's repo&s;e) to &s;ee the ruins of <HI>Carthage.</HI>&mdash;I was however half broiled in the &s;un, and overjoyed to be led into one of the &s;ubterranean apartments, which they called the <HI>&s;tables of the Elephants,</HI> but which I cannot believe were ever de&s;ign'd for that u&s;e. I found in many of them broken pieces of columns of fine marble, and &s;ome of porphyry. I cannot think any body would take the in&s;ignificant pains of carry|ing them thither, and I cannot imagine &s;uch fine pil|lars were de&s;ign'd for the u&s;e of &s;tables. I am apt to believe they were &s;ummer apartments under their palaces, which the heat of the climate render'd ne|ce&s;&s;ary. They are now u&s;ed as granaries by the coun|try people. While I &s;at here, from the town of <HI>Tents</HI> not far off many of the women flocked in to &s;ee me, and we were equally entertain'd with viewing one another. Their po&s;ture in &s;itting, the colour of their &s;kin, their lank black hair falling on each &s;ide their faces, their features and the &s;hape of their limbs, differ &s;o little from their country-people the baboons, 'tis hard to fancy them a di&s;tinct race; I could not help thinking there had been &s;ome ancient alliances between them.</P>
<P>When I was a little refre&s;h'd by re&s;t, and &s;ome milk and exqui&s;ite fruit they brought me, I went up the little hill where once &s;tood the ca&s;tle of <HI>Byr&s;a,</HI> and from thence I had a di&s;tinct view of the &s;ituation of the famous city of <HI>Carthage,</HI> which &s;tood on an i&s;thmus, the &s;ea coming on each &s;ide of it.

<HI>Genoa</HI> is &s;ituated in a very fine bay, and being built on a ri&s;ing hill intermixed with gardens, and beauti|fied with the mo&s;t excellent architecture, gives a very fine pro&s;pect off at &s;ea; though it lo&s;t much of its beauty in my eyes, having been accu&s;tomed to that of Con&s;tantinople. The Genoe&s;e were once ma&s;ters of &s;everal i&s;lands in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> and all that part of Con&s;tantinople which is now called Galata. Their betraying the Chri&s;tian cau&s;e, by facilitating the taking of Con&s;tantinople by the Turk, de&s;erv'd what has &s;ince happened to them, even the lo&s;s of all their conque&s;ts on that &s;ide, to tho&s;e Infidels. They are at pre&s;ent far from rich, and are de&s;pi&s;ed by the French &s;ince their Doge was forced by the late King to go in per&s;on to Paris, to a&s;k pardon for &s;uch a trifle as the arms of France over the hou&s;e of the Envoy, being &s;patter'd with dung in the night. This, I &s;up|po&s;e, was done by &s;ome of the Spani&s;h faction, which &s;till makes up the majority here, though they dare not openly declare it. The ladies affect the French habit, and are more genteel than tho&s;e they imitate. I do not doubt but the cu&s;tom of <HI>Cizisbeis</HI> has very much improved their airs. I know not whether you ever heard of tho&s;e animals. Upon my word, no|thing but my own eyes could have convinced me there were any &s;uch upon earth. The fa&s;hion begun here, and is now received all over Italy, where the husbands are not &s;uch terrible creatures as we repre|&s;ent them. There are none among them &s;uch brutes, as to pretend to find fault with a cu&s;tom &s;o well e&s;ta|bli&s;hed&punc; and &s;o politically founded, &s;ince I am a&s;&s;ured that it was an expedient, fir&s;t found out by the Senate, to put an end to tho&s;e family hatreds, which tore their &s;tate to pieces, and to find employment for tho&s;e young men, who were forced to cut one another's

throats, <HI>pour pa&s;&s;er le temps;</HI> and it has &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that &s;ince the introduction of <HI>Cizisbey,</HI> there has been nothing but peace and good humour among&s;t them. The&s;e are gentlemen who devote them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of a particular lady (I mean a married one, for the Virgins are all invi&s;ible, and confined to Convents:) They are obliged to wait on her to all publick places, &s;uch as the plays, opera's and a&s;&s;em|blies, (which are called here <HI>Conver&s;ations</HI>) where they wait behind her chair, take care of her fan and gloves, if &s;he plays, have the privilege of whi&s;pers. &amp;c.&mdash;When &s;he goes out, they &s;erve her in&s;tead of a <HI>lacquies&punc;</HI> gravely trotting by her chair. 'Tis their bu&s;ine&s;s to prepare for her at pre&s;ent again&s;t any day of pub|lic appearance, not forgetting that of her own name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, the day of the Saint after whom &s;he is called.</NOTE>; in &s;hort, they are to &s;pend all their time and money in her &s;ervice, who rewards them accordingly (for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pportunity they want none) but the husband is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have the impudence to &s;uppo&s;e this any other than pure Platonick friend&s;hip. 'Tis true, they endea|vour to give her a <HI>Cizisbei</HI> of their own choo&s;ing; but when the lady happens not to be of the &s;ame ta&s;te, as that often happens, &s;he never fails to bring it about to have one of her own fancy. In former times, one beauty u&s;ed to have eight or ten of the&s;e humble admirers; but tho&s;e days of plenty and humility are no more. Men grow more &s;carce and &s;aucy, and every lady is forced to content her&s;elf with one at a time.</P>
<P>You may &s;ee in this place the <HI>glorious liberty</HI> of a Republick, or, more properly, an Ari&s;tocracy, the common people being here as arrant &s;laves as the

French; but the old nobles pay little re&s;pect to the DOGE, who is but two years in his office, and who&s;e wife, at that very time, a&s;&s;umes no rank above ano|ther noble lady. 'Tis true, the family of <HI>Andrea Doria</HI> (that great man who re&s;tor'd them that liberty they enjoy) have &s;ome particular privileges. When the Senate found it nece&s;&s;ary to put a &s;top to the lux|ury of dre&s;s, forbidding the wearing of jewels and brocades, they left them at liberty to make what expence they plea&s;ed. I look with great plea&s;ure on the &s;tatue of that hero, which is in the court be|longing to the hou&s;e of duke <HI>Doria.</HI> This puts me in mind of their palaces, which I can never de&s;cribe as I ought.&mdash;Is it not enough that I &s;ay, they are mo&s;t of them, the de&s;ign of PALLADIO? The &s;treet call'd <HI>Strada Novo,</HI> is perhaps the mo&s;t beautiful line of buildings in the world. I mu&s;t particularly men|tion the va&s;t palaces of <HI>Durazzo,</HI> tho&s;e of the two <HI>Balbi,</HI> joined together by a magnificent colonade, that of the <HI>Imperiale</HI> at this village of St. <HI>Pierred' Arena,</HI> and another of the Doria. The perfection of archi|tecture, and the utmo&s;t profu&s;ion of rich furniture are to be &s;een here, di&s;po&s;ed with the mo&s;t elegant ta&s;te, and lavi&s;h magnificence. But I am charmed with nothing &s;o much as the collection of pictures by the pencils of <HI>Raphael, Paulo Verone&s;e, Titian, Ca|racci, Michael Angelo, Guido</HI> and <HI>Correggio,</HI> which two I mention la&s;t as my particular favourites. I own, I can find no plea&s;ure in objects of horror; and, in my opinion, the more naturally a crucifix is repre&s;ented, the more di&s;agreeable it is. The&s;e my beloved paint|ers &s;hew nature, and &s;hew it in the mo&s;t charming light. I was particularly plea&s;ed with a <HI>Lucretia</HI> in the hou&s;e of <HI>Balbi;</HI> the expre&s;&s;ive beauty of that face and bo&s;om; gives all the pa&s;&s;ion of pity and

The church of the <HI>Annunciation</HI> is finely lined with marble; the pillars are of red and white marble: that of St. <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> has been very much adorn'd by the Je&s;uits; but I confe&s;s all the churches appeared &s;o mean to me, after that of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> I can hardly do them the honour of writing down their names.

<P>I CAME in two days, from Genoa, through fine roads to this place. I have already &s;een what is &s;hew'd to &s;trangers in the town, which indeed is not worth a very particular de&s;cription; and I have not re&s;pect enough for the holy handkerchief, to &s;peak long of it. The churches are hand&s;ome, and &s;o is the King's palace; but I have lately &s;een &s;uch per|fection of architecture, I did not give much of my attention to the&s;e pieces. The town it&s;elf is fairly built, &s;ituated in a fine plain on the banks of the <HI>Po.</HI> At a little di&s;tance from it, we &s;aw the palaces of <HI>La Venerie,</HI> and <HI>La Valentin,</HI> both very agreeable re|treats.&mdash;We were lodg'd in the <HI>Piazza Royale,</HI> which is one of the noble&s;t &s;quares I ever &s;aw, with a fine portico of white &s;tone quite round it. We were im|mediately vi&s;ited by the <HI>Chevalier</HI>&mdash;, whom you knew in England, who with great civility, begg'd to introduce us at court, which is now kept at <HI>Rivoli,</HI> about a league from Turin. I went thither ye&s;terday, and had the honour of waiting on the Queen, being pre&s;ented to her by her fir&s;t lady of honour. I found her Maje&s;ty in a magnificent apartment, with a train of hand&s;ome ladies all dre&s;s'd in gowns, among&s;t which it was ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h the fair Prince&s;s of Carignan. The Queen entertain'd me with a world of &s;weetne&s;s and affability, and &s;eemed mi&s;tre&s;s of a great &s;hare of good &s;en&s;e. She did not forget to put me in mind of her Engli&s;h blood; and added, that
<PB N="188" REF="041644_0197_101AD30E8448C188">
&s;he always felt in her&s;elf a particular inclination to love the Engli&s;h. I returned her civility, by giv|ing her the title of Maje&s;ty, as often as I could, which perhaps &s;he will not have the comfort of hear|ing many months longer.&mdash;The King has a great deal of vivacity in his eyes; and the young Prince of Piedmont, is a very hand&s;ome young man; but the great devotion, which this court is, at pre&s;ent, fallen into, does not permit any of tho&s;e entertain|ments proper for his age. Proce&s;&s;ions and ma&s;&s;es are all the magnificence in fa&s;hion here; and gal|lantry is &s;o criminal, that the poor Count of&mdash;, who was our acquaintance at London, is very &s;eri|ou&s;ly di&s;graced, for &s;ome &s;mall overtures he pre|&s;um'd to make to a maid of honour. I intend to &s;et out to-morrow, and to pa&s;s tho&s;e dreadful Alps, &s;o much talked of.&mdash;If I come to the bottom, you &s;hall hear of me.</P>

<P>I REGEIVED, at my arrival here, both your obliging letters, and al&s;o letters from many of my other friends, de&s;ign'd to Con&s;tantinople, and &s;ent me from Mar&s;eilles hither; our merchant there, knowing we were upon our return. I am &s;urpri&s;ed to hear my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;has left England. I &s;uppo&s;e

what I wrote to her from Turin will be lo&s;t, and where to direct I know not, having no account of her affairs from her own hand. For my own part, I am confin'd to my chamber, having kept my bed till ye&s;terday, ever &s;ince the 17th, that I came to this town, where I have had &s;o terrible a fever, I believ'd for &s;ome time, that all my journies were ended here; and I do not at all wonder that &s;uch fatigues as I have pa&s;&s;ed, &s;hould have &s;uch an effect. The fir&s;t day's journey from Turin to <HI>Novale&s;&s;e,</HI> is through a very fine country, beautifully planted and enrich'd by art and nature. The next day we be|gan to a&s;cend mount <HI>Cenis,</HI> being carried in little &s;eats of twi&s;ted offers, fixed upon poles, upon mens &s;houlders; our chai&s;es taken to pieces and laid upon mules.</P>
<P>The prodigious pro&s;pect of mountains covered with eternal &s;now, of clouds hanging far below our feet, and of va&s;t ca&s;cades tumbling down the rocks with a confu&s;ed roaring, would have been entertaining to me, if I had &s;uffer'd le&s;s from the extreme cold that reigns here. But the mi&s;ty rain which fall perpetually, penetrated even the thick fur I was wrapped in; and I was half dead with cold before we got to the foot of the mountain, which was not till two hours after dark. This hill has a &s;pacious plain on the top of it, and a fine lake there; but the de&s;cent is &s;o &s;teep and &s;lippery, 'tis &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee the&s;e chairmen go &s;o &s;teadily as they do. Yet I was not half &s;o much afraid of breaking my neck, as I was of falling &s;ick, and the event has &s;hew'd, that I plac'd my fears right.</P>
<P>The other mountains are now all pa&s;&s;able for a chai&s;e, and very fruitful in vines and pa&s;tures. Among&s;t them is a breed of the fine&s;t goats in the

The &s;ame night we arrived late at this town, where I have had nothing to do but to take care of my health. I think my&s;elf already out of any danger, and am determin'd, that the &s;ore throat, which &s;till remains, &s;hall not confine me long. I am impatient to &s;ee the curio&s;ities of this famous city, and more impatient to continue my journey to Paris, from whence I hope to write to you a more diverting letter than 'tis po&s;&s;ible for me to do now, with a mind weaken'd by &s;ickne&s;s, a head muddled with &s;pleen, from a &s;orry inn, and a chamber cramm'd with mortifying objects of apothecaries viols and bottles.</P>

<P>I CANNOT give my dear Lady R&mdash;, a bet|ter proof of the plea&s;ure I have in writing to her, than choo&s;ing to do it in this &s;eat of various amu&s;ements, where I am, <HI>accableed</HI> with vi&s;its, and tho&s;e &s;o full of vivacity and compliments, that 'tis full employment enough to hearken,. whether on an&s;wers or not. The French Amba&s;&s;adre&s;s at Con|&s;tantinople, has a very con&s;iderable and numerous family here, who all come to &s;ee me, and are never weary of making enquiries. The air of Paris has already had a good effect on me; for I was never in better health, though I have been extreme ill, all the road from Lyons to this place. You may judge how agreeable the journey has been to me; which did not want the addition to make me di&s;like it. I think nothing &s;o terrible as objects of mi&s;ery, except one had the God like attribute of being capable to redre&s;s them; and all the country villages of France &s;hew nothing el&s;e. While the po&s;t-hor&s;es are changed, the whole town comes out to beg, with &s;uch mi&s;era|ble &s;tarv'd faces, and thin tattered clothes, they need <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o other eloquence to per&s;uade one of the wretch|edne&s;s of their condition. This is all the French magnificence till you come to <HI>Fontaine-bleau,</HI> when you are &s;hewed one thou&s;and five hundred rooms in the King's hunting palace. The apartments of the royal family are very large, and richly gilt; but I &s;aw nothing in the architecture or painting worth

remembring. The long gallery, built by Henry IV. has pro&s;pects of all the King's hou&s;es. Its walls are de&s;ign'd after the ta&s;te of tho&s;e times, but appear now very mean. The park is, indeed, finely wooded and watered, the trees well grown and planted, and in the fi&s;h-ponds are kept tame carp, &s;aid to be, &s;ome of them, eighty years of age. The late King pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome months every year at this &s;eat; and all the rocks, round it, by the pious &s;entences in&s;cribed on them, &s;hew the devotion in fa&s;hion at his court, which I believe died with him; at lea&s;t I &s;ee no exterior marks of it at Paris, where all people's thoughts &s;eem to be on pre&s;ent diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fair of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> is now in &s;ea&s;on. You may be &s;ure I have been carried thither, and think it much better di&s;pos'd than ours of Bartholomew. The &s;hops being all &s;et in rows &s;o regularly, and well lighted, they made up a very agreeable &s;pectacle. But I was not at all &s;atisfied with the <HI>Gro&s;&s;ierte</HI> of their Harlequin, no more than with their mu&s;ic at the opera, which was abominably grating, after be|ing u&s;ed to that of Italy. Their hou&s;e is a booth compared to that of the Hay-Market, and the play|hou&s;e not &s;o neat as that of Lincoln's-Inn-fields; but then, it mu&s;t be own'd, to their prai&s;e, their trage|dians are much beyond any of ours. I &s;hould hardly allow Mrs. O&mdash;d a better place than to be confi|dante to La&mdash;. I have &s;een the Tragedy of BAJAZET &s;o well repre&s;ented, that I think our be&s;t actors can only be &s;aid to &s;peak, but the&s;e to feel; and 'tis certainly infinitely more moving to &s;ee a man appear unhappy than to hear him &s;ay that he is &s;o, with a joyful face and a &s;tupid &s;mirk in his countenance.&mdash;<HI>A propos</HI> of countenances, I mu&s;t tell you &s;omething of the French ladies; I have &s;een all

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris,</HI> <DATE>Oct. 16, O. S. 1718.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU &s;ee I'm ju&s;t to my word in writing to you from Paris, where I was very much &s;urpri&s;ed to meet my &s;i&s;ter. I need not add, very much plea&s;ed. She as little expected to &s;ee me as I her (having not receiv'd my late letters) and this meeting would &s;hine under the hand of <HI>de Scuderie,</HI> but I &s;hall not imitate his &s;tyle &s;o far, as to tell you how often we embrac'd, how &s;he enquir'd by what odd chance I return'd from Con&s;tantinople? And I an&s;wer'd her by a&s;king, what adventure brought her to Paris? To &s;horten the &s;tory, all que&s;tions and an&s;wers, and exclamations and compli|ments being over, we agreed upon running about toge|ther, and have &s;een <HI>Ver&s;ailles, Trianon, Marli</HI> and <HI>St. Cloud,</HI> We had an order for the water to play for our diver&s;ion, and I was followed thither by all the Engli&s;h at Paris. I own Ver&s;ailles appeared to me rather va&s;t than beautiful; and, after having &s;een the exact proportions of the Italian buildings, I thought the irregularity of it &s;hocking.</P>
<P>The King's cabinet of antiquities and medals, is, indeed, very richly furni&s;hed. Among&s;t that collec|tion, none plea&s;ed &s;o well as the <HI>Apotheo&s;is</HI> of <HI>Germa|nicus,</HI> on a large agate, which is one of the mo&s;t delicate pieces of the kind, that I remember to have &s;een. I ob&s;erv'd &s;ome ancient &s;tatues of great value. But the nau&s;eous flattery and tawdry pencil of LE|BURN, are equally di&s;gu&s;ting in the gallery. I will not pretend to de&s;cribe to you the great apartment,
<PB N="199" REF="041644_0208_101AD3268508E8F0">
the va&s;t variety of fountains; the theatre, the grove of AE&s;op's fables, &amp;c. all which you may read very amply particularized in &s;ome of the French authors, that have been paid for the&s;e de&s;criptions. <HI>Trianon,</HI> in its littlene&s;s, plea&s;ed me better than Ver&s;ailles; <HI>Marli,</HI> better than either of them, and <HI>St. Cloud</HI> be&s;t of all, having the advantage of the Seine running at the bottom of the gardens, the great ca&s;cade, &amp;c. You may find information in the afore&s;aid books, if you have any curio&s;ity to know the exact number of the &s;tatues, and how many foot they ca&s;t upon the water.</P>
<P>We &s;aw the King's picture in the magnificent hou&s;e of the Duke D'Antin, who has the care of pre&s;erving them till his Maje&s;ty is of age. There are not many, but of the be&s;t hands. I looked with great plea&s;ure on the <HI>Arch-Angel</HI> of RAPHAEL, where the &s;entiments of &s;uperior beings are as well expre&s;|&s;ed as in Milton. You won't forgive me, if I &s;ay nothing of the <HI>Thuilleries,</HI> much finer than our Mall; and the <HI>Cour,</HI> more agreeable than our <HI>Hide-Park,</HI> the high trees giving &s;hade in the hotte&s;t &s;ea&s;on. At the <HI>Louvre,</HI> I had the opportunity of &s;eeing the King accompanied by the Duke Regent. He is tall and well &s;hap'd, but has not the air of holding the crown &s;o many years as his grandfather. And now I am &s;peaking of the court, I mu&s;t &s;ay I &s;aw nothing in France, that delighted me &s;o much as to &s;ee an Eng|li&s;hman (at lea&s;t a Briton) ab&s;olute at Paris; I mean Mr. LAW, who treats their Dukes and Peers ex|tremely <HI>"de haut en bas,"</HI> and is treated by them with the utmo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re&s;pect.&mdash;Poor &s;ouls!&mdash;This reflection on their abject &s;lavery, puts me in mind of the <HI>place des victoires;</HI> but I will not take up your time and my own with &s;uch de&s;criptions, which are too numerous.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="041644_0209_101AD2FA4F0D8FB8">
In general, I think Paris has the advantage of London in the neat pavement of the &s;treets, and the regular lighting them&punc; at nights, in the proportion of the &s;treets, the hou&s;es being all built of &s;tone, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e belonging to people of quality be|ing beautified by gardens.

<P>I AM willing to take your word for it that I &s;hall really oblige you, by letting you know, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, my &s;afe pa&s;&s;age over the water. I ar|rived this morning at Dover after being to&s;&s;ed a whole night in the packet boat in &s;o violent a man|ner, that the ma&s;ter con&s;idering the weakne&s;s of his ve&s;&s;el, thought it proper to remove the mail, and gave us notice of the danger. We call'd a little fi&s;hing boat, which could hardly make up to us; while all the people on board us were crying to heaven. 'Tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to imagine one's &s;elf in a &s;cene of greater horror than on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, and yet &s;hall I own it to you? tho' I was not at all willing
<PB N="201" REF="041644_0210_101ABF9DD8BBAA40">
to be drown'd, I could not forbear being entertain'd at the double di&s;tre&s;s of a fellow-pa&s;&s;enger. She was an Engli&s;h lady that I had met at Calais, who de&s;ired me to let her go over with me in my cabin. She had bought a fine point head, which &s;he was contriving to conceal from the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers. When the wind grew high, and our little ve&s;&s;el crack'd, &s;he fell very heartily to her prayers, and thought wholly of her &s;oul. When it &s;eem'd to abate, &s;he return'd to the worldly care of her head|dre&s;s, and addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to me&mdash;<Q><HI>Dear Madam, will you take care of this point? if it &s;hould be lo&s;t!&mdash;Ah Lord we &s;hall all be lo&s;t! Lord have mercy on my &s;oul!&mdash;Pray Madam, take care of this head|dre&s;s.</HI></Q> This ea&s;y tran&s;ition from her &s;oul to her head-dre&s;s, and the alternate agonies that both gave her, made it hard to determine which &s;he thought of greate&s;t value. But however, the &s;cene was not &s;o diverting but I was glad to get rid of it, and be thrown into the little boat, tho' with &s;ome hazard of breaking my neck. It brought me &s;afe hither, and I cannot help looking with partial eyes on my native land. That partiality was certainly given us by nature, to prevent rambling, the effect of an am|bitious thir&s;t after knowledge, which we are not formed to enjoy. All we get by it is a fruitle&s;s de&s;ire of mixing the different plea&s;ures and conveniences which are given to the different parts of the world, and cannot meet in any one of them. After having read all that is to be found in the languages I am mi&s;tre&s;s of, and having decayed my &s;ight by midnight &s;tudies, I envy the ea&s;y peace of mind of a ruddy milk-maid, who undi&s;turb'd by doubt, hears the &s;er|mon, with humility, every Sunday, not having con|founded the &s;entiments of natural duty in her head

by the vain enquiries of the &s;chools, who may be more learn'd, yet, after all, mu&s;t remain as ignorant. And after having &s;een part of A&s;ia and Africa, and almo&s;t made the tour of Europe, I think the hone&s;t Engli&s;h &s;quire more happy, who verily believes the Greek wines le&s;s delicious than March beer, that the African fruits have not &s;o fine a flavour as golden pippens, that the <HI>Beca figuas</HI> of Italy are not &s;o well ta&s;ted as a rump of beef, and that in &s;hort there is no perfect enjoyment of this life out of Old England. I pray God I may think &s;o for the re&s;t of my life; and &s;ince I mu&s;t be contented with out &s;canty allow|ance of day-light, that I may forget the enlivening &s;un of Con&s;tantinople.</P>

happine&s;s. I &s;ee no rea&s;on to imagine that <HI>John Hughes</HI> and <HI>Sarah Drew</HI> were either wi&s;er or more virtuous than their neighbours. That a well-&s;et man of twenty-five &s;hould have a fancy to marry a brown woman of eighteen, is nothing marvellous; and I cannot help thinking that had they married, their lives would have pa&s;&s;ed in the common track with their fellow-pari&s;hioners. His endeavouring to &s;hield her from a &s;torm was a natural action, and what he would certainly have done for his hor&s;e, if he had been in the &s;ame &s;ituation. Neither am I of opinion that their &s;udden death was a reward of their mutual virtue. You know the Jews were reprov'd for thinking a village de&s;troyed by fire, more wicked than tho&s;e that had e&s;caped the thunder. Time and chance happen to all men.
