<HEAD>THE CASE OF Robert M'Knight, A Bankrupt, Written by him&s;elf in Pri&s;on at Philadelphia, 1792.</HEAD>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">OM the month of Augu&s;t 1780, until March 1782, I was in partner&s;hip <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Hampton Rownd, on the clo&s;e of which, it appeared that the profits were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 17&mdash;one half of which was mine. During this partner&s;hip, William Alli|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the executors of John Mea&s;e, had frequently called on me to a&s;&s;i&s;t him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ating his account for that e&s;tate. This I did, and, had a good deal of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> then taken up with that bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;no &s;atisfaction for which has ever been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nor for any writings performed by me for him &s;ince.</P>
<P>A &s;uit had been brought again&s;t him before the orphans court in 1774, re&s;pect|ing the commi&s;&s;ions allowed by the regi&s;ter general on an account of that e&s;tate to September 1773. Matthew Mea&s;e and other legatees were di&s;&s;atisfied with the &s;um of &pound;2,420 commi&s;&s;ions allowed to the executors, and their account was laid be|fore auditors, who reduced the commi&s;&s;ions to &pound;1,500. This, William Alli&s;on, the acting executor demurred to, and a hearing was to have been had before the orphans court in 1775: but by rea&s;on of the departure of Matthew Mea&s;e to Eu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the latter end of 1774, and &s;oon after that of his lawyer R. Tilghman to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Indies, no further &s;tep was taken in this bu&s;ine&s;s until the late war was pretty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> advanced, during which time the courts were not much troubled with civil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ters. But in the year 1780, on the arrival of Matthew Mea&s;e from Europe, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tation i&s;&s;ued to William Alli&s;on to appear before the orphans court with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ccount, which was done in December of that year. On this bu&s;ine&s;s I attended with William Alli&s;on to explain the account. Several meetings were had and in the &s;pring 1781 the court gave a deci&s;ion &s;o as to allow &pound;58 more for commi&s;&s;ions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">han the auditors did. This deci&s;ion re&s;pected the tran&s;actions of the e&s;tate &s;o far only as September 1773. Another account was called for, of the tran&s;actions which had taken place from 1773 to 1781. This was drawn out by me and con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rd of a full quire of paper, and when pre&s;ented to the court was referred to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tors.

The report of the&s;e auditors was not &s;atis|factory, either to William Alli&s;on or the legatees, and an appeal was had to the &s;upreme court; where if the advice of the writer had been followed, Wm. Alli&s;on would have &s;aved &s;ome thou&s;and pounds; but by &s;uffering the cau&s;e to go to re|ferees, the legal ground was lo&s;t and the referees decided in &s;uch manner as to do great injury to William Alli&s;on.</P>

I had lived as a clerk to William Alli&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 1766 and 1767 and knew him then to be a man who had con&s;iderable wealth, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> believed that from that time, by the &s;ugar baking bu&s;ine&s;s he had acquired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> more con&s;iderable property.

With this he was &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of 1782, two parcels of goods arrived from France, in which William Alli&s;on was intere&s;ted. The&s;e were brought by him into the partner|&s;hip; but they con&s;i&s;ted for a great part in Mar&s;eiles quilting for men's wear, dimit|tys and other goods by no means &s;aleable, many of which remained on hand &s;eve|ral years after the peace and were &s;old at vendue to a lo&s;s: the&s;e two parcels a|mouted to about &pound;1,600. A further &s;um of &pound;150 in ca&s;h was put into the capi|tal by William Alli&s;on this year.

Accordingly the uncut goods on hand at my dwelling in Second Street were moved to his hou&s;e in Front Street to amount of &pound;3000 and upwards, and purcha&s;es were made of invoices to amount of &pound;5000, and in the fall of that year he applied to Jeremiah Warder for a letter of introduction to his brother John then in London to &s;upply to my order a quantity of dry goods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> exceeding &pound;4000 &s;terling. The order was &s;ent and goods &s;hipt per the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+merce Captain Truxton to amount of &pound;1349 &s;terling and per the Prince of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Captain All to amount of &pound;1367 &s;terling.

<P>John Bleakley, in the year 1783, before his departure to Europe, appointed William Alli&s;on his attorney in fact, who at that time owed him as a balance of a former account &pound;816. During his ab&s;ence, the rent of Bleakley's I&s;land and his other e&s;tates were received, money and bills remitted. Part of this bu&s;ine&s;s pa&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> through&mdash;the books of Alli&s;on and M'Knight, and appear therein when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fections took place&mdash;other part of this bu&s;ine&s;s was done by William Alli&s;on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o about a fortnight before his death (which happened &s;uddenly on the 11th of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me 1787) told me, that he was pre&s;&s;ed by John Bleakley for an account between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem from 1783 to 1787. I accordingly drew out from the company books all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat had come to my knowledge&mdash;this I furni&s;hed, but it was not &s;atisfactory. Then William Alli&s;on put his ca&s;h account for this e&s;tate into my hands, to draw out a full account of all the monies of Bleakley, had and paid by William Alli&s;on. This I did&mdash;and of cour&s;e all the items of the account drawn from the books of the company, were included in this la&s;t account of William Alli&s;on, as the attorney in fact, for John Bleakley, the balance of which was &pound;2518, in his favour: and to make the books of the company conform with this account, the balance of Bleakley's account in them was carried to the credit of William Alli&s;on. In the &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ccount William Alli&s;on makes a charge for commi&s;&s;ions on the bu&s;ine&s;s done&punc; of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">71.&mdash;no part of which ever came as a credit to the company; therefore, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hole was con&s;idered by me as a tran&s;action which took place between William Alli&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and John Bleakley, and in this light it will be viewed now, as it was when the account was drawn out, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to prevent the e&s;tate of Wil|liam Alli&s;on from being liable to the e&s;tate of Bleakley, for the balance. Yet this debt of William Alli&s;on, has been claimed from me, and &s;uit brought in the year 1790&mdash;to which &s;pecial bail was given.</P>

<P>The pre&s;&s;ing demands for money, induced William Alli&s;on to ride into Bucks County on the 11th of June, 1787, to obtain payment of &pound;800 long due&mdash;and to &s;ettle other matters. He left town in his u&s;ual good health, but died &s;uddenl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> before night, in walking from one plantation to another. He was removed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> town, and after his funeral, a rough &s;tatement of the partner&s;hip effects was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+ni&s;hed to his executors: &s;ome days after, John Caldwell expre&s;&s;ed his fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> John Bleakley as executor, would take the company claim again&s;t John M'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and Co. in payment of the claim of Bleakley again&s;t William Alli&s;on's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and Caldwell &s;eemed plea&s;ed, that I had got back the rough &s;tatement which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had furni&s;hed. Soon after, a particular inventory of the goods remaining on hand; was drawn out, and the goods were valued by John Smith and Jo&s;eph Swift. Hol|ling&s;worth and Fi&s;her, being pre&s;&s;ing for payment of all but the &pound;1500, I was con|&s;trained to di&s;po&s;e of the goods by public &s;ale, with the privity of William Al|li&s;on, Junior, the only male heir of my late partner, then about twenty years of age. He took &s;ome of the goods to vendue him&s;elf, and paid the proceeds to Levi Holling&s;worth. In October or November 1787, William Alli&s;on the young|er died, after a &s;hort illne&s;s, and I continued making &s;ale of the goods, principally at vendue, to make the nece&s;&s;ary payments. Towards the end of this year, I &s;ettled the account of Francis Alli&s;on, with his tru&s;tees Fi&s;her and Holling&s;wort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by giving a variety of notes, payable at &s;everal times in 1788&mdash;the mo&s;t of which were paid&mdash;&s;ome remained unpaid in the hands of Levi Holling&s;worth&mdash;on which partial payments were made, until September 1789. At this time, &s;uit was brought by Fi&s;her and Holling&s;worth&mdash;again&s;t me, on the bond for &pound;4000 &s;terling and judgment was had in Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y term 1790, with &s;tay of execution until the 15th of September in that year.</P>
<P>Several applications had been made by the executor of William Alli&s;on, for a &s;ettlement of the partner&s;hip accounts, but it was impo&s;&s;ible to render any &s;ati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+factory account, until the whole of the goods were &s;old and &s;uch debts collecte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as there was a probability of being good&mdash;but an expectation I had of borrowin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch &s;um as I might be found to owe the company, and a wi&s;h to procra&s;tinate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ettlement, until I was enabled to make payment&mdash;as al&s;o waiting for the appr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ciation of the value of my &s;hare of the certificates, were motives that governe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and to me appeared in&s;uperable barriers to the effecting &s;uch &s;ettlement.

<Q>Sir, in a conver&s;ation with my friend Mr. J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Shields about a fortnight ago, I mentioned my de&s;ire of being employed in doing any writing, while I remain in this place, to enable me to &s;upport my&s;elf, a wife and four children&mdash;and more e&s;pecially to prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of my &s;elling a property belonging to the firm of Alli&s;on and M'Knight, which will in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> years completely pay all our debts, as I think.

Since the death of Captain Alli&s;on, I have paid debts to the amount of &pound;1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">00 and up|wards, which if I had laid out in certificates, in&s;tead of paying the debts, would have now produced more than &s;ufficient to pay off all claims again&s;t the part|ner&s;hip&mdash;for as to per&s;onal debts of my own &pound;100 would extingui&s;h them: and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e have mo&s;tly accured &s;ince my confinement. But if I had inve&s;ted the &pound;1300 in certificates, a much earlier application would have been made by the creditors and the e&s;tate of Captain Alli&s;on been &s;old when it would not produce half as much as it will now. Perhaps a greater misfortune could not have hap|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed me, than a partner&s;hip with him, as I can ea&s;ily demon&s;trate. It was with a view of being able from the emoluments of the office of Ju&s;tice of the peace, and to prevent my drawing out of the funds of the partner&s;hip, that I accepted that office&mdash;this was well known to Captain Alli&s;on&mdash;for he exerted him&s;elf very much to obtain it for me, which can be averred by the freeholders of Walnut ward. Mr. Bleakley the executor of Captain Alli&s;on, called on me &s;ometime after his death, and a&s;ked me for Captain Alli&s;on's &s;hare of certain certificat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s for which &s;ome goods were &s;old in 1783&mdash;which I gave him without the lea&s;t reluctance&mdash;they exceeded 3000 dollars. My own &s;hare I was under the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ell to Mr. Matthew M'Connell, to rai&s;e money to pay a judgment obtained by the Bank of North America again&s;t me, as in|dor&s;er of two notes for a friend, who &s;ometime ago failed. When I was put here, I had not one certificate, nor have I any now, although I hear it has been confidently a&s;&s;erted that I have. When Docter M'Henry was in town, la&s;t &s;ummer, he intere&s;ted him&s;elf in my behalf&mdash;but Mr. Bleakley would do noth|ing without con&s;ulting Mr. Sargent, who advi&s;ed (as the Doctor told me) to take an a&s;&s;ignment before my liberation. This I cannot think of doing, becau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> believe time will enable me to pay every per&s;on, and have &s;omething left for my&s;elf and my children&mdash;but this I offered, that if I was liberated I would &s;tate the accounts of the partner&s;hip and &s;ubmit them to auditors, and whatever &s;um might be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound due by me to the heirs of Captain Alli&s;on, I would a&s;&s;ign my half &s;hare of the partner&s;hip property if they t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ought fit, or give my bond payable by in&s;talments and intere&s;t on each payment&mdash;this is refu&s;ed, and noth|ing &s;hort of an a&s;&s;ignment in pri&s;on will &s;atisfy. As I have it not in my power immediately, to rai&s;e money &s;ufficient to pay off the claim for which I am con|fined under a <HI>ca &s;a</HI>&mdash;I mu&s;t remain here, as contented as I can, until &s;ome occur|ence turns up to put it in my power to exonerate my&s;elf from debt.
