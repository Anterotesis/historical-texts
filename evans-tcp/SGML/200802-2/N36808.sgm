<HEAD>SERAPHINA: A NOVEL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>SERAPHINA, born at Flo|rence, of noble and wealthy par|ents, was the &s;ingle object of their affection. To a beautiful per&s;on &s;he added a cultivated under&s;tand|ing, and that ea&s;y gaiety that is &s;o rare an accompli&s;hment, while her mind di&s;played a firmne&s;s much &s;uperior to what could have been expected at her age.</P>

When ten years old &s;he lo&s;t her mother, and when twelve managed the affairs of her father's hou&s;e. At &s;eventeen her heart, become now mature, and warmed by the ardent climate in which &s;he was born, felt that void, that &s;ecret li&s;tle&s;sne&s;s which agitates &s;ouls of &s;en&s;ibility. She di&s;dained every common character, and &s;ought a heart &s;he had not yet found. She had heard much in prai&s;e of Sici|ly, and eagerly wi&s;hed to vi&s;it that country; and as her father had a con&s;iderable e&s;tate there, &s;he ea&s;ily per&s;uaded him to accompany her

thither; they accordingly &s;et &s;ail for Me&s;&s;ina.</P>
<P>On their arrival in this beauti|ful country, the Ely&s;ium of Italy, Seraphina was enchanted. The Sicilian ladies are fair, but the fair Florentine &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them all in beauty. A crowd of youths of the mo&s;t noble families thronged around her; all wi&s;hed to plea&s;e, &s;ome &s;ought her hand, but no one touched the heart of Seraphina: this triumph was re|&s;erved for a Frenchman. Sicily about that time began to attract the attention of Europe. This
<PB N="8" REF="048183_0007_1025002BA3153768">
country, &s;o rich and fertile, would have become a de&s;ert under the iron yoke of Spain, had not the people re&s;olved to break it. The Sicilians called in the aid of France to a&s;&s;ert their rights, and France &s;ent them troops, at the head of which was M. Vivonne, a man of di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities and merit.</P>
<P>This general was the brother of the famous Madame de Monte&s;|pan, and in elegance of per&s;on and accompli&s;hed manners was the counterpart of his beauteous &s;i&s;ter. She was the mi&s;tre&s;s of the king, and his favorite. Her influence had rai&s;ed him to the rank of a
<PB N="9" REF="048183_0008_1025002D343616C0">
mar&s;hal of France, an honour of which his per&s;onal merit, valour, and abilities, rendered him worthy. Victorious alike in war and lovd, his only fault was derived from the manners of his nation. This was incon&s;tancy. He too fre|quently violated the vows he &s;wore to credulous beauties.</P>
<P>He made his entrance into Me&s;|&s;ina in the character of viceroy, and the people received him with acclamations, as their long expect|ed deliverer. The city on this occa&s;ion di&s;played all its magnifi|cence. A band of martial mu&s;ic

opened the proce&s;&s;ion; a &s;plendid train of hor&s;emen followed. Next came the magi&s;trates of the city in their robes of ceremony, fol|lowed by the &s;tate coaches, the pages, and guards, richly dre&s;&s;ed in the livery of the viceroy; la&s;t came Vivonne him&s;elf, on a &s;uperb cour&s;er, and magnificently habited. He di&s;played the mo&s;t exalted dig|nity, mixed with complacence, the noble&s;t, yet mo&s;t conde&s;cending affability. Never did a more ac|compli&s;hed and perfect man pre|&s;ent him&s;elf to the eyes of an a&s;|toni&s;hed multitude.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="048183_0010_1025003343519818">
All the balconies were filled with Me&s;&s;inian ladies elegantly dre&s;&s;ed. The eyes of Vivonne were directed to them: he &s;aluted them according to the degree of their beauty, their rank, and the im|pre&s;&s;ion they made upon him. When he came before the balcony of Seraphina, he gazed a long time upon her. She was dre&s;&s;ed in a white robe, and her hair neatly and elegantly adorned. In the mid&s;t of a &s;core of beauties &s;park|ling with jewels &s;he eclip&s;ed them all; and Vivonne drew in the bridle of his hor&s;e, that he might admire her for a longer &s;pace.
<PB N="12" REF="048183_0011_10250035212A3FE8">
The mo&s;t incon&s;tant lover in the world was wounded, and wounded forever. Seraphina perceived it. The glances of Vivonne penetrat|ed her &s;oul, and to him &s;he &s;urren|dered her heart.</P>
<P>Ab&s;orbed in admiration and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he was incapable of li&s;ten|ing to the voice of rea&s;on. Vi|vonne was notorious for his incon|&s;tancy: but love, which &s;o pow|erfully triumphs in the warm cli|mate of Italy, prevented every re|flection. On the next day Vi|vonne began a round of vi&s;its to the ladies of Me&s;&s;ina, and it will
<PB N="13" REF="048183_0012_10250037F2FF1978">
not be imagined that Seraphina was forgotten. His conver&s;ation with the&s;e ladies turned on news from the court, the eulogium of the king his ma&s;ter and &s;ove|reign, and agreeable flatteries. But before Seraphina he was mute, no gallant compliments, no de&s;crip|tions of the brilliant fe&s;tivals of Paris, he addre&s;&s;ed her only by tender, but expre&s;&s;ive glances.</P>
<P>But the eloquence of French gallantry would have had little effect on the fair Florentine. She had been accu&s;tomed to prai&s;es; and what more flattering prai&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="048183_0013_1025003B6EE0B3B0">
could &s;he receive than that which the eyes of Vivonne ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;o well? Hope &s;ucceeded to the di&s;quiet &s;he had experien|ced; and certain of being belov|ed, &s;he abandoned her&s;elf without re&s;erve to the &s;weet plea&s;ure of loving.</P>
<P>Vivonne gave &s;plendid enter|tainments to all the nobility of Me&s;&s;ina. Seraphina, who was pre&s;ent at them all, con&s;tantly re|fu&s;ed to dance; contented with the company and conver&s;ation of her lover, &s;he drank deep draughts of the nectar of love, One day,
<PB N="15" REF="048183_0014_1025003D38410040">
at a particular ball, Vivonne ad|vanced with a timid air and offered her his hand. A kind of &s;hud|dering &s;hot through the veins of Saraphina: &s;he ro&s;e, her knees trembled under her; without be|ing able to &s;peak, &s;he made an obei&s;ance, tottered, found her&s;elf indi&s;po&s;ed, and immediately retir|ed.</P>
<P>The next day Vivonne paid her a vi&s;it to enquire concerning her health. He found her pale, con|fu&s;ed, her eyes ca&s;t down, and with difficulty re&s;training her &s;ighs, What Frenchman, as well as Vi|vonne
<PB N="16" REF="048183_0015_10250040B426F7A8">
would not immediately have divined the cau&s;e of her ma|lady! He makes with tran&s;port a confe&s;&s;ion of his pa&s;&s;ion, he pre&s;&s;|es and is li&s;tened to. Seraphina, all emotion, mutters a few words, and an ardent ki&s;s &s;eals their union.</P>
<P>Yes, Vivonne, I love you, &s;aid Se|raphina, when &s;he had recovered her voice&mdash;I love you and glory in it. Doubtle&s;s in your country, women are more re&s;erved and cold, but in France there is no Mount Etna. Your di&s;tingui&s;hed qualities, your virtues, all I be|hold in you, and the love I read in
<PB N="17" REF="048183_0016_1025004249012530">
your eyes, attach me to you with the fonde&s;t pa&s;&s;ion: be for ever the cho&s;en object of my heart and the di&s;po&s;er of my de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>Vivonne, in reply, &s;wore to her an eternal con&s;tancy; but this vir|tue is &s;eldom the portion of his na|tion. His heart, however, re|mained devoted to her longer than he him&s;elf could have expected. His time was divided between war and love. But the vivacity of his pa&s;&s;ion at length dimini&s;hed, and envious per&s;ons, &s;ucceeded in their attempts to di&s;turb the happine&s;s of Seraphina. For who is the
<PB N="18" REF="048183_0017_10250044CF975540">
warrior, or who the favourite of a prince, who &s;uffers not by the at|tacks of envy? It was whi&s;pered at Ver&s;ailles that Vivonne &s;uffered him&s;elf to be entirely ab&s;orbed by a blind pa&s;&s;ion, while the Hol|landers were in arms and the brave Ruyter under &s;ail for Sicily. The glory of the French arms, it was &s;aid, could no otherwi&s;e be maintained, nor the Dutch pre|vented from an ea&s;y victory, but by appointing another commander.</P>
<P>Madame Monte&s;pan with great difficulty prevented the&s;e mur|murs from reaching the ears of the
<PB N="19" REF="048183_0018_10250047A17308B8">
king. She ha&s;tened to write to her brother, and in&s;i&s;ted in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms on his renouncing a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o prejudicial to his glory and his fortune. Vivonne, pi|qued at the reproaches of his &s;i&s;ter, replied like a man of wit and gal|lantry, that &s;he her&s;elf could not but know the weight of the chains of Cupid and his power: that tho' devoted to the object of his love, he had never neglected the &s;ervice of his king, nor had ever been, nor ever would be, on that account, wanting in the ju&s;t di&s;charge of his duty.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="048183_0019_1025004A811ED5B0">
An opportunity to prove the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion &s;oon pre&s;ent|ed it&s;elf. The Spaniards had ju&s;t concluded an alliance with the States General of Holland, of whom they had &s;o long been the enemies, and whom they had treat|ed as rebels. They demanded &s;uc|cours again&s;t France, and it was re&s;olved to &s;end a fleet to Sicily. This fleet was not numerous, but its &s;trength was deemed &s;ufficient, becau&s;e it was to be commanded by the celebrated Ruyter, that in|telligent and experienced man, who from the low &s;tation of a common &s;eaman, had arrived at the rank of
<PB N="21" REF="048183_0020_1025004D0EA81EF8">
admiral, and to whom the king of Spain had offered the title of duke; an honour which he refu|&s;ed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t commander by &s;ea of the age in which he lived, whom few have equalled and none &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed; Ruyter, more than once the deliverer of his country, e&s;|teemed by the Engli&s;h, though their enemy, and dreaded by all the maritime powers of Europe, now advanced in years, but &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the fire and activity of youth, appeared at the head of the fleet of the United Provinces in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="048183_0021_102500508FACC588">
Vivonne exulted with joy that he was to enter the li&s;ts with &s;uch a rival and tore him&s;elf from the arms of Seraphina, for he had le&s;s difficulty to leave her than &s;he to part with him. He went on board the fleet, commanded by the im|mortal Duque&s;ne. The French &s;eamen impatiently demanded the battle with &s;houts of joy, while the Dutch admiral calmly prepar|ed for it with a cool unruffled courage. In the mean time Me&s;|&s;ina waited with anxiety the i&s;&s;ue of a battle which mu&s;t decide, whether patrioti&s;m &s;hould triumph or yield before its formidable ene|mies.
<PB N="23" REF="048183_0022_102500521EAA5F50">
Seraphina, little mindful of the event of the war, thought only of her lover; in&s;tead of glo|ry, &s;he wi&s;hed him to po&s;&s;e&s;s fide|lity to her; her farewell was cold and di&s;tru&s;tful, and nothing could con&s;ole this fond beauty, who con|&s;idered the indifference of Vivonne as the greate&s;t of mi&s;fortunes.</P>
<P>On a &s;udden a report was &s;pread through Me&s;&s;ina, that the pa&s;&s;ion of Vivonne was known at the court of Ver&s;ailles and that the proud Monte&s;pan had required of her brother the &s;acrifice of his love, and that Vivonne had pro|mi&s;ed
<PB N="24" REF="048183_0023_10250054E772B970">
it. Seraphina, tran&s;ported with anger and re&s;entment, wrote thus to the mar&s;hal: "Why have you never &s;poken to me of your haughty &s;i&s;ter? Is it true that &s;he wi&s;hes to break the tender connex|ion between us? Conceal nothing from me. Does &s;he not reign with|out a rival in the heart of your ma&s;ter and &s;overeign? Yet would I not change my fortune for her's, while I retain your love. How have you received the command &s;he has dared to impo&s;e on you? Can you &s;till con&s;ider her as your &s;i&s;ter, after the in&s;ult of which &s;he has been guilty? Your an&s;wer
<PB N="25" REF="048183_0024_102500576E318BD8">
will either re&s;tore me to life or terminate it in de&s;pair."</P>
<P>Vivonne, who&s;e amorous ardour was now cooled, replied to her in &s;oothing and vague terms, and a&s;|&s;ured her of the continuance of his love but he no longer felt the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion as before): Seraphina was not to be deceived. All is over, exclaimed &s;he: the ungrate|ful man loves me no longer; but I will once more read his heart; and immediately a&s;&s;uming the di&s;gui&s;e of a man's habit, &s;he took a boat, and cau&s;ed her&s;elf to be carried on board the admiral's &s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="048183_0025_1025005AEC5AC068">
The a&s;toni&s;hment of Vivonne can &s;carcely be conceived when he &s;aw a young man abruptly entering His cabin, and recognized Seraphina. I come &s;aid &s;he, to require an an&s;|wer to my letter; that you &s;ent me not being &s;atisfactory; but while the mar&s;hal endeavoured to pacify her with &s;ome incoherent excu&s;es. Seraphina perceived a beautiful young girl who retired at her ap|proach. She in&s;tantly conjectured &s;he was her rival, for lightening is not more rapid than the imagin|ation of jealous love; Vivonne had for &s;ome time cea&s;ed to-love her, another object had doubtle&s;s
<PB N="27" REF="048183_0026_1025005C83E5BDE0">
engro&s;&s;ed his attention, and this beauteous and fatal object &s;he had &s;een. Seraphina was &s;ilent, but her looks loudly &s;poke her mind: &s;he made a &s;ign to her conductor, ha&s;tily left the &s;hip, and cau&s;ed her|&s;elf to be carried back to Me&s;&s;ina.</P>
<P>She returned to that city with|out &s;peaking a word; a dreadful tempe&s;t heaved in her bo&s;om, and gave birth to an extraordinary pro|ject. She knew that Ruyter lay at anchor before Agetta, and hiring a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, &s;he cau&s;ed her&s;elf to be conveyed to the Dutch fleet and
<PB N="28" REF="048183_0027_1025005F5B6B0330">
carried on board the admiral's &s;hip. Having procured an audience of him:&mdash;Are not you, &s;aid &s;he, the invincible Ruyter?&mdash;I am Ruy|ter, an&s;wered he coolly; the title you give me belongs not to me, and it would be ridiculous pride &s;hould I accept it.&mdash;You have however come hitherto vanqui&s;h the French&mdash;That is my highe&s;t ambition, my mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h, and I will venture to declare, I am not with|out hopes of &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;Well then, illu&s;trious commander, I come to offer you the means; for they are in my power.&mdash;In your power, madam?

I believe he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es as much merit as his &s;i&s;ter does beauty.&mdash;Who? Madame Monte&s;pan! Ah! I cannot en|dure the name of that woman.&mdash;Whence, madam, this aver&s;ion? But if you plea&s;e we will mention her no more; for her brother I have the highe&s;t e&s;teem. The victory I hope to obtain will double my fame, and ha&s;ten the

His courage and prob|ity, I have frequently heard prai&s;|ed.&mdash;And that prai&s;e he de&s;erves; in his attachment to his country and his king he has ever been faith|ful: Ah! that he had been &s;o in love: but he &s;ports with the mo&s;t &s;acred oaths, and is the deceiver of our &s;ex, Oh, did you know all

I have travelled much, and have every where found that what is called good or bad fortune varies according to the ideas of mankind. In Holland, my native country, our manners are very &s;im|ple; our women devote them&s;elves to dome&s;tic cares, they nur&s;e and educate their children, and are ince&s;|antly employed in promoting the happine&s;s of their families.

How &s;hall I find words to explain to you what I &s;uffer? I loved Vivonne, I was beloved by him; I exi&s;ted only in that ungrateful man, and not in my&s;elf. The mo&s;t in&s;ulting infidelity has been my reward. I perceived it; I flew to him, on board his &s;hip. Heavens! what did I there &s;ee! a rival, a beauty I confe&s;s; but both &s;hall die.&mdash;

awe, a&s;toni&s;hment, and admira|tion.</P>
<P>Bareges was crouded, as it u&s;ual|ly is in the &s;ea&s;on, not only with French company, but al&s;o with &s;trangers, who travel from other countries, in order to u&s;e its cele|brated baths. The company amu|&s;ed them&s;elves, as they generally do at water-drinking places, by &s;auntering, lounging, cards, lotte|ries, jeux-d'e&s;prit, and &s;candal.</P>

<P>Among a number of per&s;ons of rank and fortune, there was, how|ever, one family at Bareges in a different &s;ituation. This family con&s;i&s;ted of an elderly infirm French officer, who had long been afflicted with the pal&s;y, and his daughter, a young woman about
<PB N="67" REF="048183_0066_102500C780673DB0">
nineteen years of age. Their ap|pearance and mode of living &s;eem|ed to indicate, that, though in &s;earch of relief this old officer had journeyed to Bareges, he had in &s;o doing far exceeded the bounds of economy which his circum&s;tances pre&s;cribed, and was forced to deny him&s;elf every accommodation his infirmities could &s;pare. He lived in the mo&s;t retired manner, in the wor&s;t lodging at Bareges;&mdash;and while the other ladies were dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;tyle of expen&s;ive variety and profu&s;ion, his daughter wore only a plain linen gown, which though
<PB N="68" REF="048183_0067_102500C780673DB0">
always perfectly clean, was coar&s;e; and her dark hair was left unpow|dered, and without any ornament whatever. Fortunately for Made|laine, however, (for that was her name) her per&s;on was calculated to make her coar&s;e gown appear to the be&s;t advantage; and though &s;he was not very beautiful, her countenance had an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;weetne&s;s which an&s;wered the end of beauty by exciting love and ad|miration.</P>
<P>The company at Bareges &s;oon became acquainted with each oth|er, and the ladies always took no|tice of Madelaine when they met
<PB N="69" REF="048183_0068_102500CA08A84F00">
her in their walks, which, howev|er, did not happen very often, for her father was frequently unable to go out. When he did, he was &s;upported on one &s;ide by Made|laine, and on the other by his &s;er|vant. It was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee with in&s;en&s;ibility, the attention which this intere&s;ting young wo|man paid her father, whom &s;he nev|er quitted one moment. It was remarked with what careful ten|derne&s;s &s;he u&s;ed to lead him along the &s;treets of Bareges, walking the &s;lowe&s;t pace &s;he could, and watch|ing his &s;teps as he moved feebly

And when he was not able to venture out, &s;he was &s;een at the window of their little parlour rea|ding, in order to entertain him.&mdash;Her looks and manner announced that her di&s;po&s;ition was naturally &s;prightly, and that &s;he would have been gay, if her father had not been &s;ick. But all the cheerful|ne&s;s &s;he could a&s;&s;ume while he &s;uf|fered, was exerted to amu&s;e him, and &s;horten the tedious hours of languor and debility.</P>

They knew well enough, that the gentlemen at Bareges were, for the mo&s;t part, men of the world, who tho' they may admire beauty, and approve of virtue, are never &s;o far the dupes of any tender or moral &s;entiment as to let it interfere ei|ther with their vanity, their am|bition, or their intere&s;t. Although the French revolution had not yet happened, the&s;e ladies were aware that with re&s;pect to marriage, the age of <HI>calculators</HI> was already come, and therefore no rival was to be feared in Madelaine.

and the compari&s;on generally end|ed with a deep &s;igh. The &s;cene of the&s;e meditations was cer|tainly much in Madelaine's fa|vour. Perhaps at Paris or Ver|&s;ailles, Augu&s;te might have been dazzled by the poli&s;hed graces of a fine lady rouged, powdered, per|&s;umed and equipped for conque&s;t. The&s;e artificial attractions might, perhaps, have accorded well enough with clipped trees and angular walks. But Madelaine's &s;imple manners, Madelaine's natural &s;miles, and un&s;tudied blu&s;hes, were far more in uni&s;on with the Pyrennean mountains.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="048183_0073_102500D705B0AA40">
One evening when Augu&s;te was walking in the town of Bareges with &s;ome ladies, he &s;aw Made|laine at a little di&s;tance a&s;&s;i&s;ting, with great difficulty, to &s;upport her father, who appeared to be &s;eized with a fit. Augu&s;te darted like an arrow toward the &s;pot, and held up the officer till he found him&s;elf &s;omewhat recovered; and then Augu&s;te, with a &s;ort of gen|tle violence, obliged Madelaine, who was pale and trembling, to let go her father's arm, and &s;uffer him to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;ervant in leading him home, which was but a few &s;teps farther. Augu&s;te entered the
<PB N="75" REF="048183_0074_102500D98E98F810">
hou&s;e, where he remained till the old officer was a little revived;&mdash;and, after prevailing upon Made|laine to take a few hart&s;horn drops, he retired.</P>
<P>The next morning he felt that common civility required he &s;hould pay the old officer a vi&s;it and learn how he had pa&s;&s;ed the night. It happened that Madelaine had the very &s;ame idea. "Surely," thought &s;he, "it will be very &s;trange if this young man, who was &s;o kind, &s;o careful of my father, and who made me take &s;ome hart&s;horn drops, &s;hould neglect to call and enquire
<PB N="76" REF="048183_0075_102504F0F8E62598">
after us." This idea had come acro&s;s her mind &s;everal times; and &s;he was meditating upon it at her father's bed&s;ide, when Augu&s;te was announced.</P>
<P>The old officer, who had all the fini&s;hed politene&s;s of his country and his profe&s;&s;ion, received him in the mo&s;t courteous manner; and though he &s;poke with &s;ome diffi|culty, yet he was profu&s;e in ac|knowledgments for the &s;ervice Augu&s;te had rendered him. Made|laine's thanks were few, and &s;imp|ly expre&s;&s;ed; but the tone in which they were uttered was &s;uch that Augu&s;te felt he could have &s;acrific|ed
<PB N="77" REF="048183_0076_1024A405C53E1A20">
his life to have de&s;erved them.</P>
<P>The old officer &s;till continued &s;ick, and therefore Augu&s;te &s;till con&s;idered it as an indi&s;pen&s;able mark of attention to go every day, and learn the &s;tate of his health.&mdash;He al&s;o began to feel that the&s;e vi&s;its became every day more ne|ce&s;&s;ary to his own happine&s;s. That happine&s;s was indeed embittered by many painful reflections. He well knew that to obtain his fath|er the count de&mdash;'s con&s;ent to marry Madelaine, was as impo&s;&s;ible as it was for him&s;elf to conquer the pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had in&s;pired. He knew
<PB N="78" REF="048183_0077_1024A408708566E8">
exactly the order in which his father's enquiries would run on this &s;ubject. He was aware that there were two interrogatories to be an&s;wered. The fir&s;t was&mdash;"How many thou&s;and livres has &s;he a year?" And the &s;econd&mdash;"Is &s;he noble?" And nothing could be more embarra&s;&s;ing than that the enquiry concerning fortune, would, he was &s;ure, come fir&s;t; &s;ince that was the only article which could not be an&s;wered in a &s;ati&s;factory manner; for to Madelaine's fami|ly no objection could have been made. By the way, though the former nobility of France would not ab&s;olutely contaminate the
<PB N="79" REF="048183_0078_1024A40AD6F0C998">
pure &s;treams of noble blood by an union with the daughter of a <HI>rotu|rier,</HI> they had always &s;ufficient genero&s;ity to abate &s;ome genera|tions of nobility in favour of a proper equivalent in wealth.</P>
<P>Augu&s;te, while he was convinc|ed of the impo&s;&s;ibility of obtain|ing his father's con&s;ent to his mar|riage, did not pay Madelaine one vi&s;it the le&s;s from that con&s;idera|tion; and when the u&s;ual hour of his vi&s;it arrived, he often &s;uddenly broke a chain of admirable rea&s;on on the imprudence of his attach|ment, in order to ha&s;ten to the
<PB N="80" REF="048183_0079_1024A4576312ED78">
dwelling of her he loved. In a &s;hort time he cea&s;ed all kind of rea&s;oning on the &s;ubject, and aban|doned his heart without re&s;erve to the mo&s;t violent and unconquer|able pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Augu&s;te made a declaration to the old officer of the &s;entiments which his daughter had in&s;pired. The old gentleman mentioned it to Madelaine, and &s;he only an&s;wer|ed by tears, of which he perfectly under&s;tood the meaning. When Augu&s;te explained his &s;ituation with re&s;pect to his father, the offi|cer de&s;ired him to think of his daughter no more, Augu&s;te felt
<PB N="81" REF="048183_0080_1024A45C119E44E8">
that he might as well have de&s;ired him to cea&s;e to breathe. He con|tinued his vi&s;its, and the officer was &s;oon reduced to that &s;tate of langour and debility which left him neither the power nor the wi&s;h to forbid them. His com|plaints increa&s;ed every day, and were attended with many alarm|ing &s;ymptoms. The &s;ea&s;on for the water of Bareges was now pa&s;t, and all the company left the place except the old officer, who was too weak to be removed, and Au|gu&s;te, who, while Madelaine re|mained, had no power to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> him&s;elf from the &s;pot. In a few
<PB N="82" REF="048183_0081_102500DC51455360">
weeks the old officer felt that his dying hour was near. Augu&s;te knelt with Madelaine at his bed|&s;ide&mdash;her voice was &s;uffocated by tears, and Augu&s;te had &s;carcely power to articulate in broken ac|cents that he would devote his life to the happine&s;s of Madelaine. The old officer fixed his eyes with a look of tender anxiety upon his daughter, and &s;oon after expired. Madelaine mourned for her father with uncontrouled affliction, nor could all the attentions of her lover di&s;pel that angui&s;h with which her affectionate heart la|mented the lo&s;s of her parent.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="048183_0082_102500DEDD098090">
The winter being far advanced, &s;he propo&s;ed to defer her journey to the di&s;tant province where &s;he and her father had lived, until &s;pring, and to place her&s;elf in the mean time in a convent not far from Bareges. Augu&s;te exerted all the eloquence of love to induce her to con&s;ent immediately to a private marriage. She he&s;itated at this propo&s;al; and while they were conver&s;ing together on the &s;ubject, the door of the room in which they were &s;itting was &s;uddenly thrown open, and Augu&s;te &s;aw his father the count de&mdash;enter. He had heard of the attachment
<PB N="84" REF="048183_0083_102500E169E89F58">
which detained his &s;on at Bare|ges, and had ha&s;tened to tear him from the &s;pot before it was too late. He upbraided his &s;on with great bitterne&s;s, and began al&s;o to upbraid Madelaine: but there was &s;omething in her looks, her &s;ilence, and her tears, which &s;tifled the terms of haughty reproach in which he was prepared to addre&s;s her; and ordering his &s;on to leave the room, he de&s;ired to &s;peak to her alone. After explaining to her the ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility of her being ever united to his &s;on, and his determination to di&s;inher|it him, and leave his whole for|tune
<PB N="85" REF="048183_0084_102500E3F230B1A0">
to his &s;econd &s;on, if Augu&s;te &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in his attachment to her-after endeavouring to awaken her pride and her genero&s;ity, he de&s;ired to know where &s;he propo|&s;ed going. She told him her in|tention of placing her&s;elf immedi|ately in the convent of&mdash;. He approved of this de&s;ign, and left her to go to his &s;on. No &s;ooner was the door of the room &s;hut, than Madelaine gave way to tho&s;e tears which &s;he had &s;carcely been able to refrain while the count was &s;peaking. She had never felt &s;o &s;en&s;ibly her orphan condition as at this moment; and the dear re|membrance
<PB N="86" REF="048183_0085_102500E6924A4FE0">
of her fond father was mingled with the agony of di&s;ap|pointed love.</P>
<P>Meantime the count de&mdash;declared to his &s;on, that his only chance of ever obtaining his mi&s;|tre&s;s, depended on his ab&s;olute un|conditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his com|mands, and that he mu&s;t in&s;tantly attend him to Paris. Augu&s;te ea|gerly enquired what was to be|come of Madelaine; and his father told him that &s;he had determined to take refuge in the convent of&mdash;. Augu&s;te ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to depart till he was allowed an
<PB N="91" REF="048183_0086_102500EA14A1F3B0">
con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly, in all its ex|tent and con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The count de&mdash;, who was informed of the corre&s;pondence between the two lovers, and who &s;aw little hopes of his &s;on's &s;ubdu|ing a pa&s;&s;ion which this inter|cour&s;e of letters &s;erved to cheri&s;h, contrived means to have Augu&s;te's letters intercepted at the convent. In vain Madelaine enquired with all the anxiety of tenderne&s;s for letters. In vain &s;he counted the hours till the return of the po&s;t days. Po&s;t after po&s;t arrived, and brought no tidings of Augu&s;te.
<PB N="92" REF="048183_0087_102500EBA448AA70">
Three months pa&s;&s;ed in the cruel torments of anxiety and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and were at length &s;ucceeded by de&s;pair. Madelaine believed &s;he was forgotten&mdash;forgotten by Au|gu&s;te! She con&s;ulted her own heart, and it &s;eemed to her impo&s;|&s;ible; yet, after a &s;ilence of three months, &s;he could doubt no longer.</P>
<P>Poor Madelaine now recollect|ed with angui&s;h, in&s;tead of plea|&s;ure, that all Frenchmen were free. She would have found &s;ome &s;ad con&s;olation in believing that all Frenchmen were &s;laves. It would have been &s;ome alleviation
<PB N="93" REF="048183_0088_102500EE39154BE8">
of her &s;orrows if Augu&s;te had been forced to abandon her; and &s;he fancied &s;he could have borne to lo&s;e him, if &s;he had been &s;ure that he &s;till loved her&mdash;it was lo&s;ing him by his own fault that filled her heart with pangs almo&s;t in&s;upport|able.</P>
<P>The little pittance which Made|laine, after paying her father's debts, had left for her own &s;up|port, was in&s;ufficient to defray her expences as a boarder in the con|vent. She had already by her &s;weetne&s;s and gentlene&s;s, gained the affections of &s;ome of the nuns,
<PB N="94" REF="048183_0089_102500F0F879C380">
to whom &s;he was al&s;o attached, and who ince&s;&s;antly conjured her to take the veil. "And why," &s;he &s;ometimes exclaimed, "why &s;hould I he&s;itate my longer in &s;o doing? Since Augu&s;te is lo&s;t, what have I to regret in renouncing the world? What &s;acrifice do I make; what happine&s;s do I re&s;ign?</P>
<P>Madelaine had no ties to the world, of which &s;he knew but lit|tle: but to &s;eparate her&s;elf irre|coverably, and for ever, from him to whom her &s;oul was devoted&mdash;to &s;ee him, to hear his voice no more&mdash;to take vows which would
<PB N="95" REF="048183_0090_102500F388934830">
make it even a crime to think of him&mdash;to bani&s;h him even from her thoughts&mdash;alas! Madelaine felt like Eloi&s;a&mdash;
<Q><L>All is not Heaven's while Abel|ard has part,</L>
<L>Still rebel nature holds out half my heart!</L></Q>
Sometimes too the idea occurred that Augu&s;te might love her &s;till&mdash;"And am I then," thought Made|laine, "going to reduce my&s;elf to a &s;tate in which I &s;hall be forced to wi&s;h he were unfaithful, in or|der to &s;ave me from the agonies of remor&s;e!"&mdash;She put off all thoughts
<PB N="96" REF="048183_0091_102500F6118AFF50">
of entering on her novitiate for &s;ome weeks longer&mdash;no letters ar|rived, and again her re&s;olution to take the veil returned. Why," cried &s;he, "why &s;hould I &s;till con|tinue to lament that incon&s;tant lover who thinks of me no more? Alas, did he not &s;ee the angui&s;h of my &s;oul at parting with him?&mdash;Does he not know the de&s;erted &s;ituation in which I am left?&mdash;Oh, yes! he knows I have no other refuge, no other re&s;ource than taking the veil&mdash;no doubt he wi&s;h|es to hear I have done &s;o&mdash;he will find in my renunciation of the world &s;ome excu&s;e for his infidel|ity
<PB N="97" REF="048183_0092_102500F991164C50">
&mdash;Oh, heavens! will Augu&s;te hear then that I am &s;eparated from him for ever without one &s;igh?&mdash;Ah, why need I deliberate any longer?&mdash;My trials will &s;oon be pa&s;t&mdash;I feel that my heart will break&mdash;yes, death will come to my relief&mdash;and in heaven I &s;hall find my father!"</P>
<P>Madelaine at length determined to join the holy &s;i&s;terhood of the convent. The white veil for her novitiate was prepared. The day was fixed, when, pro&s;trate with her face toward the earth, and with
<PB N="98" REF="048183_0093_102500FB2490E6A0">
flowers &s;cattered over her, and a part of her long tre&s;&s;es cut off, &s;he was to enter upon that &s;olemn tri|al preparatory to her eternal renun|ciation of the world&mdash;of Augu&s;te!</P>
<P>A few days before that which was appointed for the ceremony, Madelaine was called to the par|lour, where &s;he found her lover, with &s;ome of the municipal offi|cers of the town, wearing their na|tional &s;carfs.</P>
<P>Madelaine, at the &s;ight of Au|gu&s;te&punc; with difficulty reached a chair, in which &s;he fell back &s;en&s;e|le&s;s;
<PB N="99" REF="048183_0094_102500FEA3F3C028">
while Augu&s;te could not for|bear uttering &s;ome imprecations again&s;t the iron grate by which they were &s;eparated, and which prevented him from flying to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He, however, procur|ed help, and Madelaine recov|ered.</P>
<P>One of the municipal officers then informed her, that they had received the day before a decree of the national a&s;&s;embly, forbidding any nuns to be profe&s;&s;ed. He ad|ded, that the municipality had al|ready given information of this new law to the abbe&s;s, who had
<PB N="100" REF="048183_0095_1025010034D73CA8">
con&s;ented to allow Madelaine to leave the convent immediately. As he pronounced the&s;e la&s;t words, Madelaine looked at her lover.&mdash;Augu&s;te ha&s;tened to explain to her that his uncle, who loved him, and pitied his &s;ufferings, had, at length, made a will, leaving him his fortune upon condition that his father con&s;ented to his marriage with Madelaine.</P>
<P>When her lover and the muni|cipal officers departed, Madelaine retired to her apartment, to give way to tho&s;e delicious tears which were poured from a heart over|flowing
<PB N="101" REF="048183_0096_10250102E1FECDF8">
with wonder, thankful|ne&s;s, and joy. When her fir&s;t emotions had &s;ub&s;ided, &s;he began to pack up her little wardrobe in preparation for leaving the con|vent on the following day. "I always loved the revolution," thought Madelaine, as &s;he laid a&s;ide the white gown in which &s;he was to be married the next morning; "and this la&s;t decree is &s;urely of all others the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t&mdash;but it had come too late!"&mdash;At this idea Madelaine took up the veil for her novitiate, which lay upon her table, and bathed it with a flood of tears.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="048183_0097_10250105B72493C0">
The next morning, Augu&s;te and Madelaine were married in the pari&s;h church of&mdash;, and immedi|ately after the ceremony, &s;et out for Paris, where they now live, and are, I am told, two of the happie&s;t people, and the be&s;t patriots in France.</P>
