<Q><HI>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of re|joicing? are not even ye in the pre&s;ence of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t at his coming?</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t is a &s;ource of peculiar joy and con&s;olation to the people of God: it is a day in which their hopes and expectations will be fully an&s;wer|ed. Tribulation attends the good man while in this life; the &s;cenes of divine provi|dence are my&s;terious, and many things un|accountable and in&s;ignificant without a day of judgment; they will&punc; then be explained and adju&s;ted to the joy and admiration of all who love Chri&s;t's appearing. Many of the events that take place in this life, &s;tand in a &s;olemn relation to the judgment day, and none more &s;o than the go&s;pel mini&s;try; hence it is that the attention of the true &s;ervants of Chri&s;t is &s;o much taken up with a future &s;tate. St. Paul being detained from the Church of The&s;&s;alonica&punc; &s;ends this epi&s;tle as a token of his love and re&s;pect to them; in which he anticipates that ble&s;&s;ed period, when he &s;hould meet them at the bar of Chri&s;t, which would afford &s;uch joy and &s;atisfaction as to more then compen&s;ate for all their &s;orrow, more e&s;pecially for his being prevented a per|&s;onal inteview with tho&s;e to whom he wrote. <HI>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of re|joicing? are not even ye in the pre&s;ence of

our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t at his coming?</HI> We have two very important ideas &s;ugge&s;ted in the words. One is, that mini&s;ters and their people mu&s;t meet each other at the day of judgment.&mdash;The &s;econd is, that although mini&s;ters are often &s;eparated from their hear|ers in this life, yet the people of God among whom a pious preacher fini&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s his work, will be a cau&s;e or crown of peculiar joy and &s;atisfaction at the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t point we may ob&s;erve, to give us a &s;triking contra&s;t between this and the coming world, we are in the pre&s;ent &s;tate &s;ubject to many vici&s;&s;itudes.</P>
<P>What changes are taking place in em|pires, &s;tates, &s;ocieties, and families? In noth|ing is this more ob&s;ervable than in matters relating to mini&s;ters and the people of their charge. A per&s;ecuting &s;pirit, that prevailed in the apo&s;tolic age, was often a mean of par|ting friends, and e&s;pecially of driving preach|ers from churches: the &s;ame cau&s;e has had influence in every age of the church; but if religious &s;ocieties are &s;o happy, as to e&s;cape &s;uch a calamity, yet it plea&s;es the Great Head of the church in his &s;overeign wi&s;dom, to &s;epa|rate mini&s;ters and their people by death; this gives feeling to a pious preacher, and in &s;ome degree has influence in every &s;ermon he delivers. That all mankind will be collected before the bar of Chri&s;t, to &s;ee the great and intricate affairs of the univer&s;e adju&s;ted, is a plain dictate of rea&s;on and &s;cripture; but that
<PB N="5" REF="048467_0004_102515FDC91082C8">
many will meet there as having mutual con|cerns with each other, is evident.&mdash;More e&s;pecially, mini&s;ters and the people once com|mitted to their charge, doubtle&s;s will appear in &s;ome &s;en&s;e as di&s;tinct &s;ocieties, as having particular and per&s;onal matters to attend to.&mdash;This &s;uppo&s;es that they will have a knowledge of each other: for without this the purpo&s;es of their meeting in &s;uch a man|ner could not be an&s;wered. How far this will extend, or by what means it will be conveyed, is too curious to enquire. It &s;eems, unle&s;s we are able by &s;ome means to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e from others with whom we have been intimate in this life, the de&s;igns of a future judgment will in &s;ome mea&s;ure be fru&s;|trated. The great end of that day is to illu&s;|trate divine truth, or make that appear con|&s;picuous to created intelligence; to effect this, God will make u&s;e of mankind as in&s;tru|ments; this is the method he takes in this life, and doubtle&s;s it will be mo&s;t eligible in the world to come. For our acquaintance to be &s;ummoned as witne&s;&s;es for or gain&s;t us at this court, will perhaps be the be&s;t means to admini&s;ter conviction. In this way the great God can &s;peak in language ea&s;y for finite creatures to under&s;tand. One de&s;ign of the world, being divided into di&s;tinct &s;ocieties and communities, is doubtle&s;s to prepare matters for the day of judgment. The re|lation between mini&s;ters and people is &s;uch as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enders them capable of &s;aying much a|bout each other; in this way the ju&s;tice and mercy of God will be illu&s;trated, divine pro|ceedings
<PB N="6" REF="048467_0005_1025160AAB9B5C50">
vindicated, and every mouth &s;top|ped. It is our conduct in this life that will direct divine proceeding towards us at the fi|nal judgment; that the equity of God's ad|mini&s;trations may appear, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that our characters be clearly inve&s;tigated. The &s;alvation and damnation of many &s;ouls will be through the in&s;trumentality of faithful and unfaithful watchmen: this is an idea contained in the charge God gave to Ezeki|el, 32d Chapter. It will be nece&s;&s;ary that the motives by which mini&s;ters have been influenced in their work, be brought out to view: for without &s;incerity of heart they can never execute their office with any degree of true faithfulne&s;s, and are an high affront to God, and a vile impo&s;ition on the people.</P>
<P>At the day of judgment the <HI>doctrines</HI> with which a mini&s;ter has entertained his hearers mu&s;t be examined. However, doctrinal preaching may be di&s;carded by many and &s;uch words as <HI>metaphy&s;ical ab&s;tru&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. are of|ten made u&s;e of to ob&s;truct free and candid enquiry. Yet it is evident that one great end of the go&s;pel mini&s;try is to di&s;&s;eminate right &s;entiments; hence it is that Paul &s;o of|ten exhorts Timothy to take heed to his <HI>doc|trine.</HI> Sound doctrine, as well as good prac|tice is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute the chri&s;tian character; who&s;oever tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth and abid|eth not in the <HI>doctrine</HI> of Chri&s;t hath not God, 2 John, 9.</P>

This made St. Paul contemn &s;uch a mode of preach|ing, and determine not to know any thing &s;ave Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him cru&s;ified, 1. Cor. 2. 2. Whether vague equivocal expre&s;&s;ions have been u&s;ed to convey, or rather to ob|&s;cure the truths of the go&s;pel; by which any thing, and almo&s;t every thing may be under|&s;tood. This is cau&s;ing the trumpet to give an uncertain found; &amp; has no tendency to im|pre&s;s, or give feeling to the mind, as is the ca&s;e with the words of the wi&s;e, being as <HI>goads</HI> and <HI>nails,</HI> Eccle. 12. 11.&mdash;Whether to plea&s;e men has had greater influence in our compo&s;ing and deliver our &s;ermons and the glory of God and the good of &s;ouls. People will be examined at the bar of Chri&s;t, wheth|er they have not been dealt plainly with&mdash;Been told their characters and danger&mdash;That they are wholly oppo&s;ed to God, de&s;titute of every thing that is holy, or morally good.&mdash;That they are by nature under the cur&s;e of God's law, expo&s;ed every moment to endle&s;s woe&mdash;That they are hopele&s;s and helple&s;s in them&s;elves&mdash;The nece&s;&s;ity of the renewing influences of the &s;pirit&mdash;The nature of their imputency, that it con&s;i&s;ts in an evil heart; that therefore they are altogether inexcu&s;able, and are criminal in proportion to the degree of their inability&mdash;That nothing &s;hort of re|pentance towards God, and faith in the Lord

Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is the immediate duty of all that hear the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters and their people mu&s;t meet be|fore the Judgment Seat of Chri&s;t to give an account whether the true character of God has in any good mea&s;ure been inve&s;tigated&mdash;As a &s;in hating and &s;in revenging God&mdash;As one who in his &s;overeign wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s has elected &s;ome to everla&s;ting life, and others for the di&s;play of his power and ju&s;tice to eternal death&mdash;That he governs all things by a fixed unalterable plan. That of him, and to him, and through him are all things.</P>
<P>Without this, the character of God is kept out of &s;ight, people left in the dark, and ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not able to determine whether they love or hate the true God.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be known whether people have had the character and work of the Redeemer &s;et before then&mdash;The de&s;ign of his &s;ufferings; the efficacy of his blood, and the nece&s;&s;ity of our union to him. The manner in which divine truth has been delivered, will be a matter worthy of &s;erious examination at that day; Whether with that earne&s;tne&s;s &amp; &s;ervor, becoming the va&s;t importance and &s;o-&s;olemnity of go&s;pel truth, tending to effect the mind. The deportment, or examples of mini&s;ters among their people will be clo&s;ely attended to: their private vi&s;its, exhortations and reproofs, holy de&s;ires and wre&s;tlings for the &s;ouls of their hearers, will not e&s;cape
<PB N="9" REF="048467_0008_10251646C4B8ADE0">
public notice; the improvement that people have made of &s;uch advantages will be bro't into public view.</P>
<P>How often people have attended on the mini&s;tration of the word, and the manner how, will he matters of &s;erious concern at the judgment day. Tho&s;e excu&s;es that men make for neglecting public wor&s;hip, will be weighed in a ju&s;t &s;cale. Whether people have &s;o far contributed to the temporal &s;upport of their mini&s;ters as to enable them to devote them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t: or by too great neglect, have not ob&s;tructed the go&s;pel, robbed God, wounded their own &s;ouls.</P>
<P>It will be u&s;eful that the <HI>time</HI> of a mini&s;ters continuance among a people be known, as it will &s;erve to &s;et the characters of go&s;pel de&s;pi&s;ers in a true point of light. That min|i&s;ters and the people of their charge will meet each other at the bar of Chri&s;t is &s;ug|ge&s;ted in my text, and in other parts of the &s;acred writings.&mdash;It has already been ob&s;er|ved, that in this way truth will appear con|&s;picuous, and the conduct of God will be vindicated, and the de&s;igns of a judgment-day in the be&s;t manner an&s;wered. It may further be ob&s;erved, that the matters relating to the go&s;pel mini&s;try are of &s;uch magnitude that it appears important that they be attended to; they concern a judgment day, and an e|ternal &s;tate. When mini&s;ters and people meet in the hou&s;e of God it is an acknowl|edgment
<PB N="10" REF="048467_0009_1025168C0B8C3128">
that they believe in a future &s;tate of retribution, and is a &s;ort of appeal to the day of judgment. The influence of a faith|ful, or unfaithful min&s;ter is &s;uch as to effect unborn ages; it will commonly determine the &s;entiments and characters of their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors; and in this way they may be doing good or evil after they are dead and even to the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t. That God's ha|tred towards fal&s;e teachers, and again&s;t tho&s;e who choo&s;e them, together with their crimi|nality may appear, it will be nece&s;&s;ary that the&s;e matters are laid open at the tribunal of Chri&s;t.&mdash;As a proof of the matter under con&s;ideration I may only add: That there al|ways has been an important controver&s;y in a greater or le&s;s degree between mini&s;ters and part of their people; it is &s;o with faithful preachers and &s;ome of their hearers; wicked men oppo&s;e the doctrines they preach, and will not be convinced. Unfaithful preach|ers, they have advocates and oppo&s;ers; the di&s;pute involved the character of Chri&s;t, it cannot be &s;ettled in this world: how nece&s;|&s;ary that mini&s;ters and people meet at the great day, to have the matter decided, the doctrines of Chri&s;t vindicated, and the char|acters of mini&s;ters or people exonerated?</P>
<P>II. Another important idea contained in the text is, That the church, or people of God, among whom a faithful mini&s;ter fini&s;hes his work, will be a cau&s;e, or crown of pecu|liar joy or rejoicing at the coming of Chri&s;t. It will be matter of great &s;atisfaction to &s;et

down with Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, and other &s;aints at that day; but the &s;criptures repre&s;ent that godly mini&s;ters will derive peculiar joy from the pious part of their congregations. Dan. 12. 3, 2. Cor. 1. 14. Phil. 2. 16. Reflecting on pa&s;t providences, will be a &s;ource of great joy at the day of judgment: and as many things have taken place between a mini&s;ter and his people in which they are more particularly conver&s;ant and intere&s;ted, when they come to be ex|plained, it will afford &s;pecial joy and admira|tion, as they have been companions in tribu|lations, &s;o now it is likely they will be in a more peculiar &s;en&s;e co-partners in joy, and help each other in magnifying the Lord for &s;pecial favors, and di&s;plays of divine power and grace on their behalf.</P>
<P>The prayers &amp; &s;truggles of pious teachers have been for Zion in general, and for tho&s;e over whom the Holy Gho&s;t has made them over|&s;eers in particular: Now God will give their hearers who have been converted through their in&s;trumentality as a kind of reward and fruit of their travel or labor. When it ap|pears that God has made u&s;e of the true min|i&s;ters of Chri&s;t for the conver&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome of the &s;ouls once committed to their charge, it will excite wonder joy, and humility in the minds of pious teachers, that God &s;hould deign to honor them as in&s;truments of &s;uch glorious work, by which they will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">led to adore &s;overeign grace, and conde&s;cending love. As it is often through the painful la|bors

of Chri&s;t's &s;ervants that &s;ouls are bro't home to God, doubtle&s;s he will approve of &s;uch virtues by confering &s;ignal honors on &s;uch who have turned many to righteous|ne&s;s, who will &s;hine as &s;tars forever and ev|er.</P>
<P>Pious people will give &s;uch account of their faithful teachers as will meet with ap|probation of God, which will be expre&s;&s;ed by that heavenly plaudit. "Well done good and faithful &s;ervant! Their mutual accounts will be given up with joy, and not with grief, Hebrews 13. 17. The hopes and ex|pectations of &s;uch mini&s;ters are great, as the apo&s;tle &s;ugge&s;ts in the text&mdash;For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> even ye? &amp;c.

They reflect with plea&s;ure on the approaching happy moment, and when it comes it will greatly gratify their holy de&s;ires.</P>
<P>That it will be po&s;&s;ible to hold equal communion with all the &s;aints, e&s;pecially at one time in the invi&s;ible world, perhaps is not admi&s;&s;ible. It appears that the wicked, who have been a&s;&s;ociates in &s;in here, will be companions of torments hereafter, Luke 16. 28.</P>
<P>They are to be gathered like the &s;tanding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orn, and to be bound in <HI>bundles</HI> to burn.&mdash;It is more than po&s;&s;ible that the righteous

who have lived together in this life, will have a more intimate acce&s;s to each other in the world to come.</P>
<P>If it will be u&s;eful for them to meet in &s;ome &s;en&s;e as di&s;tinct &s;ocieties, perhaps it will &s;ub&s;erve the intere&s;t of the univer&s;e that they in a degr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee continue &s;o&mdash;It is the character of the true church of Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t that they treat his mini&s;ters with re&s;pect in this life, accounting them as the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and &s;tewards of the my&s;teries of God, 1. Cor. 4. 1. They help them in their work, 2. Cor. 1. 11. God will in the great day re|ward people for &s;uch kindne&s;s; as hereby they expre&s;s their love to Chri&s;t, Mat. 25. 40. This will gratify the benevolent feelings of Chri&s;t's &s;ervants; at the &s;ame time fill them with holy admiration, and deep humility, that what has been done to &s;uch poor &s;inful creatures &s;hould be taken notice of.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters and the people of their charge will a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, and be united in bring|ing a verdict again&s;t the wicked and impeni|tent, among whom they lived while on earth. The &s;aints are to judge the world, 1. Cor. 6. 2. One way by which they will do this, will doubtle&s;s be to declare before angels &amp; men that they know about them, or their conduct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n this life. An attachment to divine ju&s;tice will make this delightful work. Mini&s;ters ju&s;t declare what and how they have preach|ed to them, and the bad improvement they

have made of the go&s;pel, &s;o far as it has come under their ob&s;ervation; how they have de&s;pi&s;ed and mocked the me&s;&s;engers of the Lord, contemned his word and ordinances. Pious hearers can witne&s;s to the &s;ame things, and in this way the mutual te&s;timony of god|ly mini&s;ters and people will be &s;trengthen|ed and &s;upported, and divine proceedings a|gain&s;t impenitent &s;inners vindicated.

<P N="1">1. WE may infer from this &s;ubject, that the go&s;pel mini&s;try is of God, and that we ought to &s;eek its welfare, and u&s;e &s;uitable ex|ertions for its &s;upport.</P>
<P>Does &s;cripture and rea&s;on dictate that it is of &s;o much importance, e&s;pecially as it re|lates to a judgment day, we may con|clude that God would not do without it, and we may &s;ee divine wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in the in&s;titution. Nothing more conducive of divine glory, and &s;alutary to men, than the preaching of the go&s;pel.&mdash;Without the&s;e glad tidings are proclaimed, the Incar|nation of Chri&s;t is vain. Nothing but oppo|&s;ition to God, and di&s;regard to his glory, will make them indifferent to the preaching of the go&s;pel. A rejection of Chri&s;t and his mini&s;ters, have commonly vice, and open prophanity, for their in&s;eparable companions. The oppo&s;ition that the impenitent part of
<PB N="15" REF="048467_0014_102516DA53B86A88">
mankind have made to the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, has doubtle&s;s in &s;ome mea&s;ure had its ri&s;e from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that they mu&s;t meet them at the bar of Chri&s;t, to their di&s;advan|tage.</P>
<P>We may conclude that &s;ince the go&s;pel mini&s;try is &s;o very u&s;eful, that it will be con|tinued to the end of the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. When a faithful mini&s;ter is taken away it ought &s;eriou&s;ly to be regarded. But few ways perhaps that God &s;hews greater di&s;|plea&s;ure again&s;t a people than in calling his am|ba&s;&s;adors home. By this he threatens to put an end to his treaty of peace, and become irre|concilable. It may &s;ometimes be the ca&s;e that God has no more cho&s;en or elect ones among them. When Paul and Barrabas were preaching at Antioch, as many as were <HI>ordained</HI> to eternal life, believed, then they departed, Acts 13. All the encouragement for a mini&s;ter to preach among a people, &s;o far as the &s;alvation of &s;ouls ought to be a mo|tive, is the doctrine of election. After the death of a faithful mini&s;ter there is le&s;s hope of a people.</P>
<P>We may further ob&s;erve, when it is con|&s;idered, that we are to meet them no more in the hou&s;e of God, to hear them declare unto us the words of reconciliation; but our next interview will be at the tribunal of Chri&s;t, to hear them te&s;tify, for or again&s;t us, how affecting the con&s;ideration! It is more &s;olemn to die than if we had never been favored

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE OF THE REV. ABRAHAM CARPENTER.</HEAD>
<P>HE was born on the 23d of Sept. 1739&punc; at Rehoboth, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts: was &s;on of Mr. Abiel Carpenter of that place; who was a man of piety and indu&s;try; by which means his family received a religious education&punc; the fruit of which was con&s;picuous in his children, e&s;pecially in his &s;on, the &s;ubject of the&s;e me|moirs, who dates his conver&s;ion in the 23d year of his age, when he became a member of the church under the pa&s;toral care of the Rev. Mr. Roger&s;on. He was married to Miss Elizabeth Bli&s;s, daughter of Mr. John Bli&s;s of Rehoboth, in his 21&s;t year. They had ten children, four &s;ons and &s;ix daughters; their mother and &s;ix children only &s;urvive.</P>
<P>In his 24th year he moved to Killing&s;ly, in Connecticut, where he re&s;ided eight years, and commenced a preacher of the go&s;pel.&mdash;Soon after he removed to Plainfield, N. Hamp|&s;hire, where he had a call to &s;ettle in the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, which he ac|cepted; and continued pa&s;tor of a church there for 15 years, and was much e&s;teemed by his people and acquaintance.</P>

with a great depreciation of numbers in the church, an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council was called, and for the rea&s;ons above, thought it expedient to di&s;mi&s;s him from his pa&s;toral relation to that people.</P>
<P>The church at the &s;ame time cordially u|nited in <Q>Recommending him, as one who had approved him&s;elf able and faithful in his work, during the time of his having exer|ci&s;ed the pa&s;toral care of the church among them.</Q> The council at the &s;ame time con|curred with the church in recommending their pa&s;tor, &s;o far as their acquaintance would admit. This appears from a re&s;ult of coun|cil left among Mr. Carpenter's papers. He removed to Rutland, State of Vermont, March 13 1789, and was again &s;ettled in the work of the mini&s;ty, and di&s;charged the du|ties to which he was called, to the great &s;at|isfaction of his people, and gained the love and e&s;teem of all who knew him. But few give greater evidence of this love to Chri&s;t and the &s;ouls of men, than Mr. Car|penter, both in his public mini&s;try, and private deportment. He always di&s;covered that &s;im|plicity and chearfulne&s;s, mixed with chri&s;tian &s;obriety, as endeared him to all his acquaint|ance, to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e e&s;pecially with whom he con|ver&s;ed, we may &s;ay without flattery, that he was a rare example of piety.
