<Q>And it was a cu&s;tom in I&s;rael, that the daughters of I&s;rael went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ANNIVERSARY commemorations of intere&s;ting and affecting events are, probably, as ancient as &s;ociety on earth. They are, however, of early ob&s;ervance. If they did not originate in divine direction and appoint|ment, they receive countenance from the in&s;titutions of heaven, for GOD &s;trictly enjoined that the annually returning night, which was &s;o fatal to the fir&s;t born of Egypt, and &s;o propitious to the fir&s;t born of I&s;rael, &s;hould be ob&s;erved as a &s;olemn, religious, and joyful fe&s;tival, by the I&s;raelites, throughout all their genera|tions. Our text records a mournful anniver&s;ary, ob&s;erv|ed by the daughters of I&s;rael, in commemoration of the untimely death of one of their &s;ex, who nobly con&s;ented to die in obedience to the &s;acred, and &s;olemn, though ra&s;h vow of her father, when he returned in triumph from conquering his countries enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037061_0004_100C3F512FD2BCA0">
The particulars of this &s;trange event, as related in &s;cripture, are &s;imply the&s;e.&mdash;The children of I&s;rael, thrown into great con&s;ternation, by a threatened in|va&s;ion of the children of Ammon, apply to Jephthah, whom they had before exiled, to return, take the com|mand of their armies, and lead them forth again&s;t the Ammonites. Jephthah upbraids them with the injury they had done him but yields to their reque&s;t, upon condition, that at his victorious return, they would &s;ub|mit to him as their Judge and Ruler; to this they unanimou&s;ly agree.</P>
<P>Jephthah, placed at the head of his forces, addre&s;&s;es a rational and manly remon&s;trance to the Ammonites, admoni&s;hing them to de&s;i&s;t from their ho&s;tile intentions and array. The king of the children of Ammon would not hearken to the words that were &s;ent him. "And the &s;pirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah," and he pa&s;&s;ed through the coa&s;ts of I&s;rael to meet the Ammo|nites. But before he gave them battle, "Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and &s;aid, if thou wilt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands, then it &s;hall be, that what&s;oever cometh forth of the doors of my hou&s;e to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, &s;hall &s;urely be the LORD's, <HI> and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.</HI>" God gave him victory over his enemies. The children of Ammon were &s;ubdued under him; and in all the pride of conque&s;t, Jephthah was now returning to his hou&s;e in Mizpeh. But, what tran&s;itions are there often
<PB N="7" REF="037061_0005_100C3F52B999E920">
in human hopes and expectations! While he was ap|proaching the &s;eat, which he, doubtle&s;s, fondly imagin|ed would be the abode of honor and happine&s;s, behold, his daughter, with timbrels and dances, came out to meet her revered Parent, to welcome his return, and celebrate his victory. She was his only child: be&s;ide her, he had not &s;on or daughter. In recollection of his vow, what mu&s;t have been the feelings of a parent's heart! He rent his clothes, to expre&s;s his angui&s;h, and cries, "Alas! my daughter, thou ha&s;t brought me very low; for I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot go back." With filial deference and affection&mdash;with an ardor of heroic patrioti&s;m, perhaps without a parallel, &s;he meets the angui&s;h of her father, and &s;ays, "My Father, if thou ha&s;t opened thy mouth to the LORD, do to me, according to that which hath proceed|ed out of thy mouth: <HI>Fora&s;much as the</HI> LORD <HI>hath taken vengeance for thee on thine enemies, even of the chil|dren of Ammon.</HI>" After the indulgence of one &s;mall re|que&s;t, that her life might be &s;pared for two months, her father did unto her according to his vow! "And it was a cu&s;tom in I&s;rael, that the daughters of I&s;rael went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gilea|dite," or, they went to celebrate the prai&s;es of the daughter of Jephthah, and to mourn for her.</P>
<P>There might be much curios inquiry, as there has been much warm contention, re&s;pecting the obligation of this vow, or the lawfulne&s;s of the action con&s;equent upon it; but after all, how could any accurate deci&s;ion be
<PB N="8" REF="037061_0006_100C3F544A762190">
formed without a more thorough knowledge of the im|provement of Jephthah's mind, or of the means he had enjoyed of acquiring ju&s;t ideas, or of ri&s;ing &s;uperior to the power of &s;uper&s;tition, from the idolatrous practices of the neighboring nations, among whom, probably, he had been an exile? It was at this time the cu&s;tom of nations to &s;acrifice their children to their idols. The power of &s;uper&s;tition, over minds unenlightened, is be|yond conception. There can be no &s;cruple that Jeph|thah thought him&s;elf bound in con&s;cience to fulfil his vow; nothing but this could have influenced him to &s;uch a &s;acrifice. And it is equally evident that his daughter was fired with a noble &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m, and filial deference, to yield, with &s;uch a grace, to &s;uch a di&s;po&s;al of her&s;elf, and become a voluntary &s;acrifice on the altar of her country, for its happy deliverance from threatened inva&s;ion, in the intire overthrow of its ene|mies. But though, upon this &s;ubject, cen&s;ure or pane|gyric may be mi&s;takingly applied, yet admiration is a ju&s;t tribute; and we certainly mu&s;t applaud the annual te&s;timony of re&s;pect paid by the daughters of I&s;rael to the memory of this female patriot. Will then a di&s;tant and partial imitation of their example awaken cen&s;ure, or provoke reprehen&s;ion, when the &s;ea&s;on returns, that, to us, was marked with the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and affect|ing event?</P>
<P>This is the anniver&s;ary of the death of GEORGE WASHINGTON, that fir&s;t of Pariots&mdash;the friend of man&mdash;the father of his country&mdash;and, under GOD, its
<PB N="9" REF="037061_0007_100C3F5610B2D760">
protector and deliverer. On this day, the la&s;t year, death obtained one of his greate&s;t conque&s;ts, in triumphing over one, who had before ri&s;on above his enemies, above his cotemporaries; had obtained an intire conque&s;t over him&s;elf, and &s;tood unconquerable by all, but death. And though the incen&s;e of his prai&s;e then perfumed the whole country, and nations be&s;ide his own eulogized his memory, yet, as this fir&s;t anniver&s;ary &s;ince his de|cea&s;e occurs upon the day in which we are called to|gether to wor&s;hip GOD, and to notice his providences as well as his word, would it not wear the gui&s;e of pub|lic ingratitude, and criminal forgetfulne&s;s or omi&s;&s;ion, to let it pa&s;s without &s;ome public notice.</P>
<P>I hope, and believe, we are all above paying undue honors to man, or rai&s;ing any mortal above the &s;tile of humanity. We are all formed of the du&s;t, and moulded out of the clay; and perfection is a claim that no mor|tal can &s;upport. Though there are that are <HI>called</HI> Gods, many, and Lords, many, yet to us, let there be but one GOD, even the father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, the father of mercies and the GOD of all grace; and him only let us honor with divine honors. Yet there is a &s;econdary and &s;ubordinate honor due to tho&s;e whom GOD has dignified in the admini&s;tration of his provi|dence, and whom he has made the in&s;truments of public and exten&s;ive ble&s;&s;ings. Honor is due to &s;uch characters while they live, their memories &s;hould be dear when they are gone, their virtues and exploits ought to be held in grateful remembrance, and their coun&s;els and
<PB N="10" REF="037061_0008_100C3F59C5A87898">
admonitions treated with deference and re&s;pect. It is mentioned in the &s;acred volume, much to the reproach of the cotemporary generation, that, when a poor wi&s;e man, by his wi&s;dom, delivered a city, that was be&s;ieged by a great and powerful enemy, no man remembered that &s;ame poor man, but forgat him. And it is a charge of Apo&s;tolic authority, "Remember them that have the rule over you." Can we then be cen&s;ured in devoting a few moments to the melancholly and grate|ful recollection of the virtues that adorned&mdash;of the ex|ploits that &s;ignalized&mdash;and of the coun&s;els that crowned the life, of that fir&s;t of men, and mo&s;t illu&s;trious of Pat|riots, who was once all our own, and who may &s;till be ours, if we will li&s;ten to his coun&s;els, and imitate his example.</P>
<P>GEORGE WASHINGTON &s;eemed originally de&s;igned of heaven as an eminent public benefactor. He was born for others, and not for him&s;elf. And, in coinci|dence with this de&s;ign, he was denied tho&s;e objects of paternal affection which are &s;o apt to divide and di&s;tract the heart; and introduce rival intere&s;ts to the public good. In per&s;onal qualifications, which, though of in|ferior moment, are not without their u&s;e, he was di&s;tin|gui&s;hed. His &s;ize, air, attitude, deportment, and gene|ral expre&s;&s;ion were &s;uch as to command re&s;pect, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the beholder with favorable &s;entiments: but the&s;e were far exceeded by the talents and virtues of the immortal inhabitant.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037061_0009_100C3F5C40A3ECD8">
It is not to be di&s;puted, that there have been indivi|duals who have rivalled the great and good WASHING|TON in &s;ome individual talent, or human excellence; but they have been u&s;ually balanced by great defects in other talents nece&s;&s;ary to form the eminent <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. General WASHINGTON was endowed with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> un|common portion of all the virtues and talents that dig|nify and adorn the human character, and render men u&s;eful to their fellow men: and it would be hard to de|cide in which he excelled.</P>
<P>Many there have been who have had minds more cultivated and improved by a regular attention to a &s;y&s;tematic education; and more thoroughly ver&s;ed in the ab&s;tru&s;er parts of &s;cience: but where will you find a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a greater fund of u&s;eful knowledge, or who knew how to make a better u&s;e of it upon all proper occa&s;ions. His corre&s;pondencies and communi|cations, whether in his public or private capacities, would do honor to the fir&s;t of &s;cholars, and mo&s;t pol|i&s;hed of men; no man ever knew better the <HI>how</HI> and the <HI>when;</HI> no man ever di&s;covered greater addre&s;s in rendering them &s;ub&s;ervient to his governing object, <HI>the public good.</HI></P>
<P>If there was a talent that was preeminent in General WASHINGTON, and in which he excelled all others, was it not a talent of conciliating cla&s;hing intere&s;ts, of meeting and directing public opinion, without any zeal|ous interference with the cour&s;e of things? His native, inviolable, integrity and fidelity; his &s;teady, uniform,
<PB N="12" REF="037061_0010_100C3F5DCC0C80D0">
and unperverted patrioti&s;m &s;econded the influence of this talent; and his firm belief of the overruling provi|dence of GOD, and of his own accountablene&s;s to the Judge of quick and dead, &s;ecured to his country all the good that could be derived from &s;uch a talent, and guarded it from all the evil to which it would expo&s;e, in the brea&s;t of unprincipled, or a&s;piring ambition. By this, more than by any thing el&s;e, was that uncommon man formed and qualified to act the great and novel part a&s;&s;igned him on the theatre of time; to harmonize and concentrate the &s;entiments of di&s;tant and diver&s;ified &s;tates, to create and form defen&s;ive armies collected from the&s;e &s;everal &s;tates, to &s;often their jealou&s;ies, amal|gamate their manners, and render them bands of breth|ren, animated by one common &s;pirit, and directing their energies to one common object. By this was he al&s;o admirably qualified to pre&s;ide in Council, and lead the intrigues of de&s;igning &s;ubtilty, and the errors of mi&s;tak|ing judgment, to the &s;ame eventual happy i&s;&s;ue. But time will permit only to mention a few of the more prominent features in the character of this excellent man, who&s;e days were numbered and fini&s;hed, the la&s;t fourteenth of December.</P>
<P>The deeds and exploits of the illu&s;trious WASHING|TON were numerous and various as his virtues; and he might be many times hailed the in&s;trumental Saviour of his country: early called into her &s;ervice, he ac|quitted him&s;elf with honor and dignity: for though his military career commenced with le&s;s happy au&s;pices,
<PB N="13" REF="037061_0011_100C3F60B3B13338">
and &s;avage ambu&s;h and dexterity put to &s;light the ar|my with which he was connected, yet the &s;cattered re|mains were principally indebted to his valor and addre&s;s that any of them e&s;caped the fate of their brethren.</P>
<P>When our revolutionary &s;truggle became of &s;o &s;eri|ous a nature, that we mu&s;t either repel our exactors, or be under tribute; the pre&s;ence of General WASHING|TON at the head of our armies, while it gave order, life, and dignity to them, rai&s;ed the drooping &s;pirits of the country, and like an electric &s;hock, vivified the whole continent. And not only in his whole military career, and its happy i&s;&s;ue, in our peace and independence, mu&s;t he be acknowledged our fir&s;t Benefactor: But in a variety of in&s;tances he &s;eems to have been our <HI>only</HI> &s;heild and deliverer. On that memorable Chri&s;tmas eve, when his dimini&s;hed, di&s;banding, and de&s;erted ar|my, were retreating before a flu&s;hed, an indignant, and exulting foe&mdash;when every face gathered palene&s;s, and almo&s;t every heart failed with fear, how did his unex|pected, heroic, and &s;ucce&s;sful attack at Trenton change the face of things, and &s;pread gleams of light upon our national horizon? He might then be called the Saviour of his country. But, not to multiply in&s;tances from his military career; his ri&s;ing &s;uperior to the attacks of &s;lan|der and intrigue; his remaining unmoved and &s;teady to his purpo&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the ungenerous and hu|miliating de&s;ertions and returns he experienced, which would have &s;oured, if not de&s;troyed, almo&s;t any patriot|i&s;m but his, are &s;o many in&s;tances, in which he may be called the Saviour of his country.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="037061_0012_100C3F62B187CB58">
When the revolutionary army was about di&s;banding, having defended their country, vindicated her rights, and &s;ecured to her the enjoyment of peace and indepen|dence, the influence and addre&s;s of their illu&s;trious commander di&s;concerted and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed an in&s;idious and artful de&s;ign, formed and ripened by &s;ome of the a&s;piring officery, of turning their arms again&s;t the country, unle&s;s Congre&s;s complied with conditions, that were at that time, ab&s;olutely impracticable; here, again he was the &s;aviour of his country.</P>
<P>Retiring from the field, &s;urrounded with glory, that few conquerors have acquired, he is &s;oon called to pre|&s;ide in that illu&s;trious a&s;&s;emblage of Patriots, who were delegated to form a new con&s;titution of govern|ment for confederate America. And the name of WASHINGTON &s;tands fir&s;t on the re&s;plendant roll to that Con&s;titution of government, which was the in&s;tru|ment of &s;aving the country from imbecillity, confu&s;ion and contempt.</P>
<P>Being &s;ummoned to the chief magi&s;tracy, by the unanimous &s;uffrage of his country, at a period mo&s;t eventful, when a political foreign tempe&s;t was ju&s;t bur&s;t|ing forth, which has &s;haken and affected almo&s;t every nation; in which &s;tate of things, he could find no aid to his judgment but in his inviolable integrity, and enlightened patrioti&s;m, which were a&s;&s;ailed by every artifice: He cho&s;e for his country, that neutral &s;tation which has hitherto repelled the force of the tempe&s;t, and rai&s;ed her in wealth, reputation, and happine&s;s. Here again WASHINGTON may be hailed the &s;aviour,
<PB N="15" REF="037061_0013_100C3F64B4E9E600">
of his country. And, would the time permit, in&s;tances might be multiplied, in which his &s;ignature, no le&s;s than his &s;word, has been the mean of averting porten|tous evils, of procuring to his country momentous ble&s;&s;ings; for which the ju&s;tice of po&s;terity will fully accredit him.</P>
<P>The&s;e are few of the virtues and exploits, that formed the character, and dignified the life of that fir&s;t of men, of heroes, and of patriots, whom GOD rai&s;ed up to be the champion of Liberty, the defender of his country, and the benefactor of mankind. In what human character was there ever combined a greater a&s;&s;emblage of u&s;eful and ornamental virtues? What hand was ever the in&s;trument of more eminent or various political and civil ble&s;&s;ings? What channel was ever more replete with providential benedictions? But they, who are cal|led Gods, mu&s;t die like men. This fourteenth of De|cember &s;aw the great and good WASHINGTON fall like one of the people: his memory and his virtues are ju&s;tly dear to grateful country, and ought to be frequently recollected with a mournful plea&s;ure. But he can now be of no farther u&s;e to us, than as we imbibe his &s;pirit, and cover our&s;elves with his mantle, by li&s;tening to his coun&s;els and imitating his example.</P>
<P>"Saye&s;t thou, America, thou mourne&s;t great WASHINGTON?"</P>

Peculiarly fortunate for us, we are not left to conjecture or collect the wi&s;hes and de&s;ires of our de|cea&s;ed father and benefactor, from his general character, or diver&s;ified communications at different periods of life; he has furni&s;hed us with them, at a time, and in cir|cum&s;tances, when they could flow from nothing but a &s;pirit of di&s;intere&s;ted patrioti&s;m: when no hopes, or fears could influence him to keep back any thing that he thought could be profitable to us: and when the love of his country, a parental &s;olicitude, for its honor and welfare, were, not only profe&s;&s;edly, but mo&s;t manife&s;tly, the predominant pa&s;&s;ions of his heart. The wi&s;hes and de&s;ires of parental &s;olicitude, the coun&s;els and cautions of enlightened patrioti&s;m, he has left us in an addre&s;s, which is ju&s;tly &s;tiled a political legacy, of greater value to this country than a mountain of Gold, or a mine of Diamonds; &s;o long as ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom are e&s;teemed virtues on earth, or liberty and order have any votaries, it cannot fail to be e&s;teemed and eulogized. And would to GOD, that, being annually read, it might regu|late the &s;entiments, and influence the practice of the enlightened citizens of America to the late&s;t generations. The experience we have had, in the few years that have elap&s;ed &s;ince it was delivered, mu&s;t have in|crea&s;ed our ideas of its importance to us, and exalted our admiration of the enlightened and di&s;cerning pat|rioti&s;m of its author, if it does not lead us to imagine that, rai&s;ed to the &s;tile of a prophet, he was favored with a vi&s;ion of the impending dangers of his country.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="037061_0015_100C3F67E3B6FD78">
Pre&s;uming that the love of liberty was &s;o "interwov|en with the ligaments of our hearts," that it could not be lo&s;t but with the di&s;&s;olution of our frame, our decea&s;|ed Coun&s;ellor begins by a&s;&s;uring us "it is of infinite moment that we &s;hould properly e&s;timate the immen&s;e value of our national union, to our collective and indi|vidual happine&s;s," and that we &s;hould indignantly frown upon the fir&s;t dawning of every attempt to &s;hake or enfeeble it; or to di&s;turb that unity of government, which is the palladium of our political &s;afety and pro&s;|perity.</P>
<P>In contemplating the cau&s;es that might di&s;turb our union, he cautions again&s;t tho&s;e that may ari&s;e from characterizing parties by geographical di&s;criminations, which may convey the idea, that there is a real differ|ence of local intere&s;ts and views; and &s;ays, "The name of <HI>American,</HI> which belongs to you, in your na|tional capacity, mu&s;t always exalt the ju&s;t pride of pat|rioti&s;m, more than any appellation derived from local di&s;criminations." He admoni&s;hes us to cheri&s;h an en|lightened confidence in the government we have e&s;tab|li&s;hed; and to give it our decided &s;upport; a&s;&s;erting that "re&s;pect for its authourity, compliance with its laws, and acquie&s;cence in its mea&s;ures, are duties enjoin|ed by the fundamental maxims of true liberty," and that all "ob&s;tructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and a&s;&s;ociations, under whatever plau&s;ible character, with the real de&s;ign to direct, control, coun|teract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the

<P>He de&s;cribes in frightful colors the evils, both foreign and dome&s;tic, that ari&s;e from parties in a State; and, with parental &s;olicitude, exhorts us to watch again&s;t them; for when they prevail, there is confu&s;ion and every evil work; and the public good is made but a tennis ball to&s;&s;ed from the mouth of party to party, on|ly with a view of &s;ecuring them the victory. And a greater than WASHINGTON has &s;aid, "that a kingdom or hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf, cannot &s;tand, but comes to de&s;olation."</P>
<P>He cautions tho&s;e intru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of government, to confine them&s;elves within their con|&s;titutional &s;pheres, avoiding in the exerci&s;e of the pow|ers of one department, to encroach upon another.</P>

"Again&s;t the in&s;idious wiles of foreign influence, (I conjure you to believe me, fellow citizens) &s;ays he, the jealou&s;y of a free people ought to be con&s;tantly awake;" "But that jealou&s;y, to be u&s;eful, mu&s;t be impartial; el&s;e it becomes the in&s;trument of the very influence to be avoided."</P>
<P>He admoni&s;hes us to cheri&s;h public credit; to avoid occa&s;ions of expence; but cheerfully and &s;ea&s;onably meet them, as they nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e; that we may not load po&s;terity with an encumbered patrimony, or render it a beque&s;t &s;carcely worth their receiving. After all,</P>
<P>This great and good man was fully &s;en&s;ible, that all his coun&s;el and advice, his cautions and admonitions, would be of no avail, without a re&s;pectful and national regard to the duties and obligations of religion and mo|rality. This, therefore, he enjoins upon us as of mo&s;t momentous con&s;equence; a&s;&s;erting, that no citizen can claim the tribute of patrioti&s;m, or be ju&s;tly intitled to the confidence of man, who endeavors to &s;ubvert, or does not u&s;e his influence to &s;upport "the&s;e great pillars of human happine&s;s; the&s;e firme&s;t props of the duties of men and citizens," and he unites the voice of rea&s;on and experience again&s;t the delu&s;ive, though fa&s;hionable idea "that national morality can prevail in exclu&s;ion of re|ligious principle."</P>

tried and approved patriot, who being all his country's, and having done all that mortal could do, to &s;ecure and perpetuate her independence and pro&s;perity, laid down the burden of mortality, the la&s;t fourteenth of Decem|ber, and joined his kindred &s;pirits. His memory will ever be de&s;ervedly mo&s;t dear, and the &s;ons and daugh|ters of America may yearly mourn for him, and celebrate his prai&s;es. But in vain do we pretend to revere his memory, or pour the grateful incen&s;e on his name, un|le&s;s we re&s;pect his coun&s;els and imitate his virtues.</P>

<P>As the death of this great man mo&s;t loudly proclaim|ed the vanity of all human glory, and forced a convic|tion of the impropriety of placing confidence in any be|ing blow GOD, or of leaning upon any arm but the arm of the Almighty; &s;o the return of the anniver&s;ary &s;hould renew the conviction, and influence us to "cea&s;e from man who&s;e breath is in his no&s;tril, for wherein is he to be accounted of."

Providence, and the coun&s;els of wi&s;dom, have all their expectations from him, who rules in the kingdoms of men, and gives them to whom&s;oever he plea&s;es. He plants, and he plucks up; he builds, and pulls down. Amid&s;t all the wild confu&s;ion that has marked the ad|mini&s;tration of his providence over this apo&s;tate world, GOD is carrying on his own purpo&s;es, and accompli&s;hing his own de&s;igns; and will bring them to an eventful i&s;&s;ue, in the intire change and di&s;&s;olution of this vi&s;ible frame of things. But there &s;hall be a new heavens, and a new earth wherein righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall dwell. GOD has founded a kingdom that cannot be &s;haken, a dominion that &s;hall la&s;t forever. Let us be concerned to become &s;ubjects of this kingdom, and heirs of the glory that &s;hall be there di&s;played. This honor and happine&s;s is &s;ecur|ed, only by believing in CHRIST, by obeying his go&s;pel, and keeping his commandments, who is not the &s;aviour of a country merely, but, of the whole world. To him with the Father and Holy Gho&s;t be glory and honor, prai&s;e and dominion, forever and ever,</P>
