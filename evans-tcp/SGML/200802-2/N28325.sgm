<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is po&s;&s;ible that my Reader may not be acquainted with the Runic mythology, I have added Notes, at the end of each Vo|lume of this Work (to which the Numbers are a direction), explaining as much as is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make it perfectly intelligible. Any further elucidation may be obtained by a re|ference to MR. MALLET'S "Northern An|tiquities;" which publication contains the Edda, tran&s;lated from the ancient I&s;landic tongue, and has principally &s;upplied me with my Notes.</P>

<HEAD>ILDEGERTE, QUEEN OF NORWAY.</HEAD>
<P>WHO art thou, Oh heroine! endowed with the powerful &s;pirit of Odin<NOTE N="1">ODIN, al&s;o called Woden, Father of the Gods. He, his wife Freya, and &s;on Thor, compo&s;e the &s;upreme council of hea|ven. He is called the Univer&s;al Father, The Terrible and Severe God, The King of Slaughter, The God that carrieth De&s;olation and Fire, the Active and Roaring Deity, The Giver of Victory, &amp;c. The fourth day of the week is con&s;ecrated to him, and there|fore called Woden's day.</NOTE>, and graced with the captivating &s;weetne&s;s of Freya?<NOTE N="2">Frea, or Freya, wife of Odin, and mother of the inferior Deities. The&s;e names are, by &s;ome, a&s;cribed to two Godde&s;&s;es, the former being Queen of the Gods, and the latter, &s;i&s;ter of Erey. To her the &s;ixth day of the week is con&s;ecrated.</NOTE>.&mdash;Who art thou, who&s;e image darts its rays &s;o bright through the cloud which veils the wonders of antiquity?&mdash;Ri&s;e, ri&s;e, &s;acred &s;hade of Ildegerte, ri&s;e from the holy habitations of Vingolf<NOTE N="3">Vingolf, the man&s;ion of Love and Friend&s;hip.</NOTE>&mdash;thou, before who&s;e name I bend my knee, as heroine, as wife, as mother!</P>
<P>Swend was the Prince's name whom Thora bore, to reign hereafter over Norway.&mdash;As yet, the cradle was his throne, the ro&s;e-bud his &s;ceptre. As yet he felt no pain but hunger, and no re&s;t but &s;leep. With female penetration and manly &s;pirit, Thora ruled the raw Norwegians;&mdash;with female gentle|ne&s;s and manly firmne&s;s, &s;he conducted her belov|ed &s;on, from the narrow limits of infancy to the wide-extending path of youth. He grew. Upon

his countenance bloomed the hope of the ap|proaching morn, and grey-headed warriors, when they &s;aw him, &s;troked their beards, and &s;miled.</P>
<P>No co&s;tly ornaments and &s;ilken garments, no &s;tudied &s;miles and borrowed ro&s;es, at that time, oc|cupied the morning hours of Northern women. The girl who wi&s;hed to plea&s;e a Norwegian, mu&s;t renounce the common employments of a female, and accu&s;tom her&s;elf to the warlike toils of man; mu&s;t curb the &s;teed of Iceland with uncovered hand, mu&s;t kill the flying game with certain arrow, and oppo&s;e her glittering &s;hield to the threatening &s;word of her companion.</P>
<P>Thora, her&s;elf a perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of the&s;e exer|ci&s;es, a&s;&s;embled a troop of Amazons, who, led by her, cha&s;ed the wolf and bear through almo&s;t im|penetrable fore&s;ts. Oft did the Queen &s;it on &s;ome lofty bank, and fea&s;t upon the&s;e &s;ports; yet ever did her eye beam mo&s;t friendly on her deare&s;t com|panion Ildegerte; for none like her could vault upon the back of the impetuous &s;teed; none &s;ent the arrow &s;o certain to its mark; none broke a lance with &s;o much grace. And when &s;he rai&s;ed her vi&s;or to regain her breath; when her full blue eye glanced round more dangerous than her &s;word; when &s;he moved, and the plume upon her helmet

&s;lowly nodded; when &s;he &s;poke, and her voice &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed the &s;weetne&s;s of the flute&mdash;Oh! then aro&s;e in the heart of the young Prince an inde&s;cribable &s;en&s;a|tion, which his wary mother &s;aw, now in his glow|ing eye, now in his glowing cheek. She &s;aw it with a &s;mile of content; for though no royal blood flowed in the veins of Ildegerte, yet was &s;he the la&s;t &s;urviving branch of a noble family, and would, if the daughter of a boor, have been worthy of the fir&s;t throne on earth. Who was able to enchant each heart like Ildegerte? Who &s;eemed &s;o little to intend it? Her companions &s;aw her, and were envious; they &s;poke to her, and envy vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>About that time Canfried, the young King of Sweden, was travelling through the Northern Courts. Ambition brooded in the dark rece&s;&s;es of his &s;oul. The thir&s;t for power fla&s;hed from his &s;cowling eye. Not content to &s;way the groaning inhabitants of Sweden with an iron &s;ceptre, he re&s;olved, by the &s;ucce&s;s of a robber's arms, to encircle his brow with a triple crown. For this purpo&s;e was it that he traver&s;ed Denmark and Norway&mdash;for this purpo&s;e was it that he cautiou&s;ly approached their thrones, and &s;pied into the &s;itua|tion of their &s;trength and weakne&s;s. He was
<PB N="8" REF="037753_0006_100F441336328EB8">
hand&s;ome as Utgarda-Loke<NOTE N="4">Utgarda Loke, an evil &s;pirit, nearly re&s;embling our devil. He is de&s;cribed in the Edda (or Bible of the Northern nations) as exceeding hand&s;ome, but crafty and per&s;idious. He is called, The Artificer of Fraud, The Calumniator of the Gods, &amp;c. He, neverthele&s;s, dwelt in Heaven, till, as a puni&s;hment for his re|peated crimes and attacks upon the Gods, they chained him to three &s;harp &s;tones, which are for ever cutting his fle&s;h; while a &s;erpent, hanging over him, di&s;tils its venom, drop by drop, upon his face. In this &s;ituation he is to remain till the de&s;truction of the world.</NOTE>, and villanous as he; cruel as the wolf Fenris<NOTE N="5"><P>The wolf Fenris, a &s;on of Utgarda Loke. He was bred among the Gods; but they, being warned by oracles that he might one day become fatal to them, re&s;olved to confine him. No chains, however, could be forged which were &s;trong enough to hold him. At length a dwarf, in the land of the Black Ge|nii, &s;upplied Odin with a bandage of uncommon &s;trength. Go|ran&s;on's de&s;cription of its texture is &s;o ludicrous, that I am in|duced to tran&s;cribe it:</P><P>"Hic nervus &s;ex con&s;tabat rebus; &s;trepitu nempe pedum felis, ex barb&acirc; mulieris, radicibus montium, nervis ur&s;inis, halitu pi&s;|cium, &amp; &s;puto avium."</P><P>"This &s;tring con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix things, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the noi&s;e made by a cat's feet, the beard of a woman, the roots of mountains, the nerves of bears, the breath of fi&s;hes, and the &s;pittle of birds."</P><P>Having bound the wolf with this cord, they drew it through a huge rock, to which he is doomed to be confined till the la&s;t day, when he is to break loo&s;e, and devour the &s;un.</P></NOTE>, and poi&s;onous as the Midgard<NOTE N="6">The &s;erpent of Midgard, one of Utgarda Loke's children, and an enemy of the Gods. Odin threw him to the bottom of the ocean, where he grew &s;o large, that he wound him&s;elf around the whole globe of earth.</NOTE> &s;erpent.</P>
<P>In honour of her gue&s;t, Thora appointed a &s;plended tournament. Towards the decline of day, when the Knights, weary of warlike diver&s;ions, had di&s;encumbered them&s;elves of their helmets, the young heroines of Norway (&s;uch was Thora's will) entered the li&s;ts with courteous air, and demanded that Canfried &s;hould break a lance with them. With a &s;mile the young King &s;eized his &s;pear (for he was well ver&s;ed in chivalry); with a &s;mile he threw him&s;elf upon his prancing charger, and rode into the open li&s;ts. But again&s;t his nervous arm the force of the Amazons was vain; their lances &s;plit again&s;t his &s;hield, like the light gondola on the craggy rock. At length appeared Ildegerte. The purple beams of the &s;etting &s;un &s;hone on her poli&s;hed helm; the &s;teed &s;oon felt her &s;pur; &s;wift as an arrow &s;he ru&s;hed again&s;t the King. Her lance &s;hivered; but Canfried's feet flew from the &s;tir|rups, and &s;carce could he pre&s;erve his &s;eat.</P>
<P>"Thou art &s;trong," cried the a&s;toni&s;hed Swede, "let me behold the countenance of my antagoni&s;t."</P>
<P>Ildegerte &s;prung nimbly from her hor&s;e, ca&s;t away her helmet, and her auburn locks fell in art|e&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="037753_0007_100F4415792E4A58">
ringlets down her &s;now-white neck. The look which &s;he ca&s;t on Canfried &s;ubdued him on the &s;pot: it was a look full of dignity, &s;weetened by a half-&s;mile; but even half a &s;mile from Ildegerte might have animated a &s;tone. The proud tyrant of Sweden &s;tammered forth his admiration, and, like a lone&s;ome flower upon a barren heath, love took root in his heart.</P>
<P>Already was the lamp of day extingui&s;hed in the ocean; already the bright moon had ri&s;en in the unclouded &s;ky, when the jocund troop, after having quaffed the overflowing horn, wandered into the cool refre&s;hing wood. Here &s;ome Knight was &s;tretched upon the gra&s;s, and &s;uing to the dear object of his love for the reward of con&s;tancy. There the Scalds<NOTE N="7">Scald, the name given to the ancient bards, who were em|ployed to compo&s;e odes and hymns, which were chaunted at every &s;olemnity. The&s;e &s;ongs were, in general, de&s;criptions of eminent exploits, and were animated by an enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit.</NOTE> were heard to chaunt the deeds of ancient times, and bli&s;sful &s;pirits of Val|hall<NOTE N="8">Valhall, the palace of Odin, to which warriors are con|veyed after death. Here they pa&s;s their mornings in tournaments and battles; the re&s;t of the day is employed in fea&s;ting on the wild boar Serimner (which, though dre&s;&s;ed every morning, be|comes entire again every night), and in quaffing Hydromel (or mead), which is admini&s;tered to them in the &s;culls of tho&s;e ene|mies whom they had &s;lain while on earth.</NOTE>; while the nightingale &s;weetly intermixed her warblings with the lofty &s;ong. Here two friends &s;auntered, arm in arm, engaged in confi|dential di&s;cour&s;e; there a dozen nymphs were &s;porting near a murmuring rill.</P>
<P>Deep in the thickets was a fall of water, which formed a ba&s;on at the mountain's foot. Near to the gra&s;&s;y edge there laid a mo&s;&s;y &s;tone, warmed by the heat of day. Here, in the cool of eve,
<PB N="10" REF="037753_0008_100F441709937A20">
was Ildegerte wont to bathe. Naked &s;he &s;at upon the &s;tone, while the &s;mall waves curled to the bank, and ki&s;&s;ed her feet. To-day too &s;he &s;tole away (perceived, as &s;he thought, by none but the cha&s;te moon), far from the gay bu&s;tle of the Court, to this her favourite &s;pot. As the wood re&s;ounded &s;till with noi&s;e and jubilee, &s;he ventured not, as u&s;ual, to ca&s;t away her burden&s;ome attire; but drawing her garment to her knees, and throwing her &s;andals on the gra&s;s, &s;he &s;tepped into the wa|ter where it was &s;o &s;hallow that it &s;carce &s;prinkled her ancles.&mdash;Cha&s;te girl! the invi&s;ible hand of Ge|fione<NOTE N="9">Gefione, the Godde&s;s of Cha&s;tity.</NOTE> was &s;tretched above thee; for, in&s;pired with brutal pa&s;&s;ion, Canfried watched thy &s;teps, ru&s;hed through the thicket, and, with a peal of laughter, took the &s;andals from the bank.</P>
<P>"Prince," &s;aid Ildegerte, turning round, and letting her garment fall, "Prince, in this country we think &s;uch conduct improper."</P>
<P>"How!" replied Canfried, "improper to &s;ur|pri&s;e a lovely girl when &s;he is bathing! Then, par|don me, the Norwegians de&s;erve to have no lovely girls among them."</P>
<P>"And if the females of your land," returned Il|degerte, "allow them&s;elves to be &s;urpri&s;ed &s;o wil|lingly, they indeed de&s;erve &s;uch conduct as your's.&mdash;Return my &s;andals, and begone."</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037753_0009_100F441997D5CE80">
"You might as well de&s;ire me to lo&s;e my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">n&s;es," an&s;wered Canfried.</P>
<P>"Then, Prince," cried Ildegerte, enraged, "you have lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of decency; and &s;en&s;e, without decency, is a tree without leaves."</P>
<P>"Admirable!" exclaimed the King, "you can play on words as well as hearts. But, with due deference to your decency and &s;en&s;e, allow me to bind the&s;e &s;andals to your feet again."</P>
<P>"I command you to begone," cried the fair heroine.</P>
<P>"Do you think your&s;elf in danger?" returned Canfried.</P>
<P>"Oh no!" an&s;wered Ildegerte di&s;dainfully.</P>
<P>"You are &s;evere," &s;aid he. "You do not even think me dangerous? Come, away with this deri&s;ion and this &s;corn! Ildegerte I love you."</P>
<P>"Likely enough truly, after an acquaintance of two hours," rejoined &s;he.</P>
<P>"So much the more flattering to you," &s;aid the King.</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t own I did not know it," replied &s;he; "I can at lea&s;t find nothing but my face to thank for it."</P>
<P>"No, Ildegerte; thou ha&s;t wounded me deeply. Fair thou art as No&s;&s;a<NOTE N="10">Noffa, the daughter of Frea, a Godde&s;s of &s;uch exqui|&s;ite beauty that whoever is lovely and hand&s;ome, or whatever is precious, is called by her name.</NOTE>&mdash;wi&s;e as Vora<NOTE N="11">Vora, the Godde&s;s of Prudence and Wi&s;dom, who is &s;o penetrating, that nothing can remain hidden from her.</NOTE>.&mdash;

I have a wife whom I dare not &s;purn from me, for her father is a powerful Prince; but come to my arms! Thou &s;halt be treated as a Queen. Come, &s;hare my heart and bed."</P>
<P>"To &s;uch a propo&s;ition," an&s;wered &s;he, "Il|degerte has but one reply."</P>
<P>She &s;truck him on the face, and fled.&mdash;Furious and vengeful he ru&s;hed after her; but with airy &s;teps, that &s;carcely &s;kimmed the tender gra&s;s, Ilde|gerte glided through the wood, led by the echoing horn, which ever attended on the Queen. There &s;he humbled her&s;elf at the feet of Thora, and was &s;ilent. The pur&s;y Swede, who likewi&s;e &s;oon ar|rived, felt no de&s;ire to mention, in the pre&s;ence of witne&s;&s;es, the indignity he had &s;u&s;tained. But, ere long, the Queen di&s;covered Ildegerte's naked foot, and a&s;ked her favourite why &s;he was without &s;andals.</P>
<P>"I went," an&s;wered Ildegerte, with unaltered look, "to wa&s;h my feet; I threw my &s;andals on the gra&s;s, and conclude that &s;ome bea&s;t of the fore&s;t mu&s;t have &s;tolen them."</P>
<P>"That bea&s;t was I," roared out Canfried, with grim ferocity; "that the &s;andals belonged to you, I knew not; for had I known it they had lain there &s;till."</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="037753_0011_100F441C9533F2B0">
With the&s;e words he ca&s;t them at Ildegerte's feet.</P>
<P>"Prince," &s;aid Thora, with an air of &s;olemn maje&s;ty, "when next you come into my kingdom, remember that it is my kingdom."</P>
<P>Canfried returned no an&s;wer. Swend looked a&s;kance at him. The courtiers murmured. Ilde|gerte &s;miled. This moment was the dreadful &s;ource of many a crime, of many a fatal hour. The enraged Swede, who&s;e heart was the lurking place of every villany, returned that very night to his native country, and carried the fable poi&s;on of revenge deeply rankling in his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Slowly and mournfully approached the hour in which Thora, the mother of her people, paid the debt of nature, and was tran&s;ported to the ever|la&s;ting joys of Vingolf. She expired in the arms of Ildegerte and her &s;on;&mdash;&s;he expired as &s;he pro|nounced her ble&s;&s;ing upon both.&mdash;Amid&s;t the un|feigned lamentations of many thou&s;ands of her &s;ubjects was the grave prepared, which was to cover her remains. Silent, and with overflowing eyes, the poore&s;t per&s;on brought &s;ome gift to be buried, according to the cu&s;tom of the country, with the dead. No Knight was a&s;hamed of the tear which &s;tarted in his eye. Swend &s;obbed, and
<PB N="14" REF="037753_0012_100F441ED68E6618">
hid his face. Ildegerte threw her&s;elf upon the grave, and wa&s;hed her di&s;hevelled locks with tears.&mdash;Still was &s;he lying there, in torpid grief, when Midnight had &s;pread her mantle over wood and &s;ea.</P>
<P>The murmuring waves, the ru&s;tling pines, and Ildegerte's groans, were the only interruptions of the deep tranquillity. At length the morning broke upon her &s;orrows, but it pre&s;aged a dreary rainy day. The feathered &s;ong&s;ters crept into their ne&s;ts; the ravenous vulture only hovered in the air. Ildegerte &s;prung up&mdash;ca&s;t another inex|pre&s;&s;ible look of &s;orrow on the grave, wet with the dew of heaven and her tears&mdash;threw a lock of hair upon it, and fled&mdash;fled with her companions to the innermo&s;t rece&s;s of a wood, where, in the &s;hade of rugged oaks, an ancient ca&s;tle offered an a&s;ylum to the fugitives, who long taught its walls to echo &s;ighs for the lo&s;s of Norway's benefactre&s;s.</P>
<P>Swend, now nineteen years of age, mounted his mother's throne, and followed her in&s;tructions by promoting the happine&s;s of his people, by li&s;ten|ing to, and relieving the unfortunate, by chu&s;ing proper objects for his friend&s;hip, and by fulfilling all the duties of a Knight.</P>
<P>But love accompanied him to the throne. In
<PB N="15" REF="037753_0013_100F442060EBE6F8">
the mid&s;t of &s;tate concerns, in the a&s;&s;emblage of his Knights, in the temple of ju&s;tice, at the altar of Odin, his eye wandered round in &s;earch of Il|degerte. His heart mi&s;&s;ed her at the jocund fea&s;t, at the chorus of the virgins, and combat of the lance.</P>
<P>"What &s;trange &s;en&s;ation" &s;aid he to him&s;elf (when he had one day &s;tolen from the table, where the &s;parkling brimmer invited him in vain, where the Scalds in vain &s;truck the &s;ilver chords, and &s;ung the noble deeds of his forefathers), "what &s;trange &s;en&s;ation makes my throne to me a dreary &s;epulchre&mdash;my heart in&s;en&s;ible to the joys of be|nevolence and friend&s;hip? Away with this &s;plen|did &s;lavery! The holy raptures of Valhall could not force a &s;mile from me, as long as Fate forbids me to enjoy it doubly in the arms of love. What binds my tongue, that it makes not the confe&s;&s;ion which floats upon my lips? What chains my hand, that it lays not crown and &s;ceptre at her feet, for whom the crown and &s;ceptre &s;eem to have been formed?&mdash;Away to Ildegerte!&mdash;What is birth? Can royal blood make a fool wi&s;e, or a villain vir|tuous?&mdash;Oh! in her alone can Thora live again! With her alone can I ta&s;te the plea&s;ures of a throne!"</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="037753_0014_100F4422970FF9F8">
He &s;poke, and went to &s;acrifice in Louna's<NOTE N="12">Lo&s;na, or Louna, the Godde&s;s who a&s;&s;i&s;ts lovers, and makes up differences between them and married per&s;ons, be they ever &s;o much at variance.</NOTE> temple.</P>
<P>"Reverend old man," &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing the Prie&s;t, "the &s;ervants of Odin have foretold to me the fate of my throne. Their words were dark, but I am ea&s;y; for 'tis the tyrant only who can fear futurity. Do thou foretel to me the fate of my heart, which is to me of no le&s;s value. But let thy words be clear as light, for every lover fears futurity."</P>
<P>The hoary Prie&s;t, with reverence, bent his knee, and proceeded to invoke the Deity of the Temple. The flame mounted from the altar, and Swend's heart, clear and cha&s;te, towards heaven.&mdash;The Prie&s;t returned with &s;olemn a&s;pect; a cloud hung upon his brow, but mortal eye could not di&s;tin|gui&s;h whether &s;ome baleful planet, or the &s;un of hope was hid beneath this cloud. After a &s;hort, but awful pau&s;e, he &s;poke:</P>
<P>"Beloved of the Gods and of thy people, a good Prince finds his reward in the arms of a Val|kyrie<NOTE N="13">Valkyries, Virgins who are &s;ent by Odin into the field of battle, to in&s;pire the warriors, to make choice of tho&s;e who are to be &s;lain, and to alleviate the pangs of death.

<P>"'Tis &s;he! 'tis &s;he!" cried the enraptured Monarch. "To what mortal female in my realms could Louna give a title more than mortal? To her alone! To Ildegerte! I thank thee, reverend

old man. Soon &s;halt thou hear from me&mdash;&s;oon &s;hall the &s;teps of this your temple groan beneath the weight of gifts which I will heap upon your altars. Farewell! Give me thy hand. Farewell! Pray for me!"</P>
<P>"Prince," &s;tammered the Prie&s;t, &s;haking his &s;il|ver locks with warning mien.&mdash;</P>
<P>But Swend no longer heard him. Swend flew through the wood, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in &s;peed by nothing but his thoughts. The form of Ildegerte &s;wam before his &s;ight. The name of Ildegerte floated on his lips. His &s;weet interpretation of the delu|&s;ive oracle &s;eemed to him the only one within the &s;cope of po&s;&s;ibility. Panting, he arrived at the gates of his ca&s;tle, and ordered his &s;wifte&s;t &s;teed to be prepared. In glowing colours Fancy painted the delight of a fir&s;t meeting, after the &s;eparation of a year; but the warlike trumpet &s;oon awoke him from his vi&s;ionary bli&s;s.</P>
<P>"Yes," cried Tott, the chief of all his troops, "prepare thy &s;wifte&s;t &s;teed, collect thy Knights and warriors, and march again&s;t the traitor Can|fried. See&s;t thou that weeping multitude of fu|gitives, which increa&s;es every moment? One left his hou&s;e in flames; another &s;aw his wife defiled; a third fled over his ravaged fields; a fourth beheld

the murder of his helple&s;s father! With a troop of banditti, Canfried is &s;preading de&s;olation through thy territories.&mdash;Yes! prepare thy &s;wifte&s;t &s;teed; a&s;&s;emble the valiant Norwegians. Away again&s;t the villain! Let him feel that the blood of thy ance&s;tors flows in thy veins, that the arms of thy Knights are firmly nerved, and that old Tott is &s;till alive."</P>
<P>Like a man who wakes from golden dreams by the &s;tab of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, Swend &s;tarted at this dread|ful news; but a &s;ingle glance towards his wretched &s;ubjects &s;ubdued the lover, and called forth the hero. He di&s;patched expre&s;&s;es to his faithful Knights throughout the land. From every quarter they crowded with their hardy trains of well-armed va&s;&s;als. With beating heart, Swend in a few days beheld, beneath his ca&s;tle's walls, a nu|merous army, and at their head the dauntle&s;s Tott.</P>
<P>"I go to relieve my &s;ubjects," whi&s;pered the powerful voice of valour in the Prince's brea&s;t, "their mi&s;ery and groans demand my help. Silent be the milder voice of love, till I can lay the lau|rels, and my people's gratitude at Ildegerte's feet."</P>
<P>Clad in his burni&s;hed armour, the young hero pre&s;&s;ed his charger; at his &s;ide rode the intrepid Tott. The warriors &s;truck their &s;hields; the
<PB N="19" REF="037753_0017_100F44299FC9FC38">
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">lds &s;ung &s;olemn hymns; the army marched. Old men, women, and children, were a&s;&s;embled on the road. They ble&s;&s;ed their Ruler, who &s;a|luted all with friendly air; and, with uplifted eyes and hands, they &s;ued the Gods for victory and life.&mdash;Thus went the warriors thir&s;ting for battle and revenge. Succeeding me&s;&s;engers, who brought accounts of accumulated rapine and mur|der, blew every Norwegian's heart into a raging blaze.</P>
<P>The ho&s;tile armies were now &s;eparated but by half a day's march, when Swend convened the chiefs and leaders of the people, and &s;tanding on a ri&s;ing ground, he thus addre&s;&s;ed them with the fire of youth:</P>
<P>"My brave and faithful countrymen, be to|morrow the deci&s;ive day. Let &s;acrifice be offered at the altar of Odin, that he may grant us victory&mdash;the victory of ju&s;t revenge. Advance with your troops, under cover of the night, again&s;t this murderer and robber, that at break of day, the &s;word of my people may &s;end the plunderer, while he &s;leeps, into the arms of Hela<NOTE N="14">Hela, or Death, the daughter of Utgarda Loke. She was precipitated into Niflheim by Odin, and there had the go|vernment of nine worlds given to her.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>"Not &s;o," replied the cool experienced Tott; "let us act honourably, and according to the laws of war&mdash;let us &s;end a herald to the Swedi&s;h

camp, to learn the cau&s;e of this attack. If Can|fried require what is ju&s;t, and he be willing to re|pair the calamities occa&s;ioned by this inroad, then chu&s;e, Oh King! the palm of peace, and &s;heath the murderous &s;word."</P>
<P>"Require!" exclaimed Swend, "what can he require?&mdash;Repair! what can he repair?&mdash;Is he a God, that he can re-animate my faithful &s;ub|jects?"</P>
<P>"Alas, no!" returned Tott, "the dead are dead;&mdash;never have our eyes again beheld the mor|tal who had left this earth. But &s;till live the or|phan children of the &s;lain&mdash;&s;till &s;ighs many a widow, far from the habitation of her &s;laughtered hu&s;band. To the&s;e let Canfried open his trea&s;ures, and repay them trebly for the bloody booty."</P>
<P>"What!" cried Swend, with generous heat, "&s;hall I take payment for my people's blood?&mdash;Never!&mdash;Canfried's kingdom &s;hall not buy a drop from the meane&s;t of my &s;ubjects."</P>
<P>"Ju&s;t and true, if that blood were yet un&s;hed," replied the old General; "fal&s;e and wrong if it be already &s;hed.&mdash;Or wilt thou lead thy troops to death without nece&s;&s;ity?&mdash;Thou ha&s;t lo&s;t hun|dreds, perhaps will &s;acrifice thou&s;ands."</P>
<P>"Enough!" an&s;wered the young King, "be it

according to thy wi&s;h. I revere thy coun&s;el as the coun&s;el of a father."</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this determination, &s;oon as the morning dawned, a herald came to Canfried's tent, and demanded admittance to the King. Through rows of &s;coffing guards he was conducted to the tyrant's feat; who, &s;urrounded by arms, &s;eemed to read treachery in every eye, and, in the mid&s;t of his &s;ubjects, trembled at the ru&s;tling of a withered leaf.</P>
<P>"Speak; what would&s;t thou here?" &s;aid he to the herald.</P>
<P>"Hear me, Canfried, King of Sweden. Through me &s;peaks Swend, the mighty King of Norway. Why ha&s;t thou fallen on me, like a robber on the &s;leeping traveller?&mdash;Why ha&s;t thou &s;lain my &s;ub|jects, and laid wa&s;te my realms?&mdash;Why ha&s;t thou infringed upon the rights of nations, and not ho|nourably declared war again&s;t me?&mdash;Behold! the blood of my &s;ubjects cries to me for vengeance. I am approaching with my warriors, and Odin will cha&s;ti&s;e thee by my arm. But if thou, like an honourable King and Knight, will declare unto me the cau&s;e of this attack, rebuild the habitations of my &s;ubjects, &s;ilence the complaints of the wi|dows and orphans thou ha&s;t made, then will I con|vene
<PB N="22" REF="037753_0020_100F4431A0D5A7A8">
my chiefs and leaders, &s;tate thy demand inge|nuou&s;ly to them, and, if &s;uch be found ju&s;t and proper, by my royal word will I grant it. But, if thou refu&s;e this offer, let Odin judge between me and thee. The groans of the dying, and blood of the &s;lain be upon thy head!"</P>
<P>The herald cea&s;ed. Canfried, contracting his bri&s;tly eye-brows, darted a threatening look at him, and thus replied:</P>
<P>"Go, tell the &s;tripling Swend, that Canfried, King of Sweden, Lord of a mighty empire, at which the whole North trembles, has more than a &s;ufficiency of land and gold; that he requires not from the Prince of Norway even a &s;pan of earth; that his royal clemency is willing to atone for the calamities occa&s;ioned by his warriors on one condi|tion&mdash;The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ildegerte was the only mo|tive of my u&s;ing arms; let Swend, within three days, re&s;ign her to my royal bed, and the&s;e threat|ening troops &s;hall quit his borders. If not, with &s;word in hand will Canfried force his way through the Norwegian ranks."</P>
<P>Beneath an aged oak the King was &s;itting at the feet of Tott, catching each in&s;tructive word that dropped from the lips of the experienced Chief. The herald came into his pre&s;ence, and, not without
<PB N="23" REF="037753_0021_100F44332B12B7D8">
trembling, delivered to him Canfried's haughty an&s;wer. Scarce had he ended, when Swend &s;prung up, and gna&s;hed his teeth. Old Tott remained calmly in his place.</P>
<P>"Sooner &s;hall the &s;tone float on the water's &s;ur|face," cried the King, "&s;ooner &s;hall the &s;tream return to its &s;ource, than I accept this ignomini|ous condition."</P>
<P>"Not &s;o ha&s;ty, young man," an&s;wered Tott, "let us coolly examine this propo&s;al; let us pro|perly place in competition what thou wilt lo&s;e with what thou may&s;t lo&s;e: Thou wilt lo&s;e a girl&mdash;thou may&s;t lo&s;e a kingdom."</P>
<P>"But this girl was the favourite of my mo|ther," rejoined Swend.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;&s;ings be upon thee, for thus revering the memory of thy mother," &s;aid the Chief; "but even Thora her&s;elf would have &s;acrificed her favourite for the welfare of her people."</P>
<P>"And &s;hall I then," cried the Prince, "make Ildegerte mi&s;erable? Shall I deliver her, who ne|ver injured me, into the arms of a barbarian&mdash;her, for whom each Knight would draw his &s;word with plea&s;ure? Never, never!"</P>
<P>"But is it then &s;o &s;ure," demanded Tott, "that Ildegerte will be mi&s;erable? How many
<PB N="24" REF="037753_0022_100F44359E2ADAC8">
women have, by gentlene&s;s and wi&s;dom, tran&s;|formed blood-thir&s;ty tigers into men? Has not Ildegerte &s;ufficient talents and perfections to change this libertine, this enemy of Norway, to a loving hu&s;band, and thy country's &s;taunch ally?</P>
<P>"And is not our defeat," re&s;umed the King, "as doubtful as that Ildegerte will be happy in the arms of Canfried?&mdash;I mi&s;take thee, Tott; thou art at the head of a powerful army&mdash;thou art required to &s;ight in the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice, and thou feare&s;t to do it."</P>
<P>"Ah! young man," an&s;wered the hoary war|rior, with a &s;mile, "when thou art hereafter tran&s;ported to Valhall&mdash;when thy father and mo|ther come to meet thee, let them bear te&s;timony whether &s;ear was ever known by Tott. No!&mdash;Thrice on the&s;e borders have I led to victory the warriors of Norway. When I returned trium|phant from the la&s;t, I put into thy hands the laurel-crown, be&s;towed upon me by thy father, and thou playd'&s;t with it in thy cradle.&mdash;Thy father &s;hook my hand, and &s;aid, 'Dear Tott'&mdash;methinks I &s;till can hear him&mdash;'&s;hould Odin &s;ummon me before my &s;on arrives at manhood, let thy &s;word be u&s;ed for him, as it has been for me; but teach him, one mu&s;t never fight, unle&s;s for a better purpo&s;e than to be able thus to play with laurels."</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="037753_0023_100F4438D66805E0">
"Forgive me, dear old man," exclaimed Swend, "but thou mi&s;take&s;t me in thy turn. May Vara<NOTE N="15">Vara, the Godde&s;s who receives all oaths, and puni&s;hes tho&s;e who violate them.</NOTE> puni&s;h me, if mad ambition fires my &s;oul!&mdash;But infamous it &s;eems to me, to buy a peace at &s;uch a price&mdash;infamous to make &s;uch a propo&s;al to Ildegerte."</P>
<P>"The latter I will undertake," replied Tott.</P>
<P>Swend &s;tarted, but the Chief continued&mdash;</P>
<P>"I know Ildegerte's exalted &s;entiments: &s;he is always more than woman&mdash;often more than man. Her father was my friend, and the companion of my youth;&mdash;he fell in battle at my &s;ide, and his la&s;t breath recommended Ildegerte to my care. I have obeyed him, and &s;he well de&s;erves it. In her dwells the &s;pirit of her father. Joy will &s;parkle in her eye when I inform her that the &s;acrifice for which &s;he is &s;elected, will &s;ave the lives of many thou&s;ands&mdash;perhaps too the life of her King."</P>
<P>Here he ro&s;e.</P>
<P>"I ha&s;ten to her. Meanwhile conclude with Canfried a truce of &s;ix days; before the expiration of which, I &s;hall bring Ildegerte to the camp."</P>
<P>He attempted to go, when Swend, in violent agitation, held him.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="037753_0024_100F443B17B33AF0">
"One moment more, dear Tott&mdash;only a &s;ingle moment!&mdash;And do&s;t thou really think that&mdash;that&mdash;?"</P>
<P>"I think," an&s;wered the old man, &s;urveying him with great a&s;toni&s;hment, "I think I do not under&s;tand thee, and am a&s;hamed to &s;ee thee tremble."</P>
<P>"Oh my friend and father!" exclaimed Swend, throwing him&s;elf into the arms of Tott, "I love Ildegerte!"</P>
<P>A pau&s;e en&s;ued.</P>
<P>"Indeed!" &s;aid the old man, "now I compre|hend all this&mdash;now all is plain enough. Now too I forgive the accu&s;ation again&s;t me. Thou love&s;t Ildegerte? And what do&s;t thou intend to make her?"</P>
<P>"Can Tott a&s;k &s;uch a que&s;tion?" demanded Swend, with dignity.</P>
<P>"Thy wife then!" replied the Chief, &s;haking his hoary head. "Young man, young man, I can|not approve of this. But to convince a lover, is more than to gain three victories. I am mute. Come let us away to battle."</P>
<P>"Yes, to battle, to battle!" cried Swend. "To fight at thy &s;ide is but pa&s;time."</P>
<P>They went. The young King flew from tent to
<PB N="27" REF="037753_0025_100F443D4E1E9408">
tent, embraced each Knight, &s;hook each va&s;&s;al by the hand, &s;hot fire into each bo&s;om from his eyes, and in&s;pired the whole army with his youthful ardour. In a few minutes the &s;houts of battle echoed through the camp. The King was followed by old Tott, who earne&s;tly &s;urveyed the field of battle &s;tretched before him, and pointed out to every Knight the po&s;t which he was but to quit as con|queror or corp&s;e. Amid the clamour of the troops, through which the war-hymns of the Scalds were &s;carcely audible, Swend &s;aw, in every poli&s;hed &s;hield, the form of Ildegerte. Amid the wild tu|multuous &s;houts he could hear nothing but the li&s;p|ing voice of Ildegerte. Retired within his tent, he threw him&s;elf upon a couch, and thus gave vent to his feelings&mdash;</P>
<P>"To ri&s;k my life and throne for Ildegerte&mdash;to lo&s;e my life and throne for Ildegerte, is a thought devoid of bitterne&s;s. But if Odin has re&s;olved to &s;pare the villain for a longer trial&mdash;if Fate has fixed on me, as an example, that the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice does not always conquer; if, in&s;tead of flying into Ildegerte's arms, I may to-morrow fly into my pa|rents' arms, who will then declare what Swend has done for her&mdash;for her, who little fancies what a &s;acrifice I am about to offer, who perhaps has

I &s;hall bear with me the certainty of Ildegerte's re|gret to the bli&s;sful habitations of Valhall. He &s;poke; &s;eized the parchment, and wrote:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>"Swend, King of Norway, to Ildegerte.</HEAD>
<P>"Can you, dear companion of my youth, &s;till recollect tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed days of innocence and joy, when, under Thora's eye, each evening &s;eemed to come too &s;oon?&mdash;Does your tongue &s;till &s;ometimes li&s;p the name of brother, with which I &s;o often was enraptured? Do you &s;till bear in mind the &s;acred ble&s;&s;ing be&s;towed upon us by my mother when &s;he left this world? If you have yet &s;ome faint remembrance of tho&s;e happy days, pa&s;&s;ed in fraternal intercour&s;e, when I concealed no &s;ecret from you&mdash;then, cen&s;ure me that I have hid within my bo&s;om, for whole months, wi&s;hes and hopes which even at this in&s;tant, cau&s;e my hand to trem|ble, and my cheek to glow, as if Thora's &s;on could harbour a di&s;honourable thought. I have &s;acrificed in Louna's temple&mdash;that is my &s;ecret. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ildegerte&mdash;that is the &s;um of all

my hopes and wi&s;hes. To rob me of you, Can|fried has invaded Norway with a powerful army. The fatal hour approaches which is to decide be|tween his cau&s;e and mine. If Love and Fortune be propitious to my arms, Swend, in a few days, will lay his crown at Ildegerte's feet, and Ildegerte will complete the ble&s;&s;ing which my mother gave us as &s;he died. But if my rival triumph (and the fir&s;t moment of his triumph mu&s;t be the la&s;t of my exi&s;tence), then, Ildegerte, drop a tear upon my early grave; lament the lo&s;s of a brother&mdash;of a hu&s;band."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>After he had &s;ealed this letter with the button of his &s;word, he gave it to a tru&s;ty me&s;&s;enger, whom his longing eye &s;till followed till he vani&s;hed among the intercepting mountains.</P>
<P>He returned with lighter heart into his tent. His attendants came to arm him. With delight he gazed upon the burni&s;hed harne&s;s which, ere long, was to be &s;ullied with the blood of his ene|my, or with his own. He thought the iron hel|met ea&s;ier than before; the cor&s;let far le&s;s cumber|&s;ome. He vaulted on his charger, and flew with naked &s;word to the head of his army. The troops received him with a joyful &s;hout.</P>
<P>"A blue plume," whi&s;pered one to another,
<PB N="30" REF="037753_0028_100F4444107CCB70">
"let us not lo&s;e &s;ight of him. 'Tis the young hero's fir&s;t campaign, and his fiery looks declare his eagerne&s;s. Ha&s;te hither, old experienced Knights, and gather round him."</P>
<P>And now thirty or forty of the brave&s;t warriors encircled the King. Each brea&s;t was another buckler to him; and this &s;mall determined troop more valuable far than all the paltry guards around the throne of Canfried. Old Tott brandi&s;hed his glit|tering &s;word above his head with youthful &s;trength, and hark! The trumpet's warlike clangor &s;truck the ear from each end of the troops. The Scalds chaunted &s;olemn hymns; the Knights clo&s;ed their vi&s;ors; the arms of the va&s;&s;als cla&s;hed; the char|gers &s;tamped; the en&s;igns floated in the air; the heart of the young King beat high.</P>
<P>"Why delay?" cried he to the deliberate Chief. "Forward, &s;wift as lightning! See! the nervous arms of my Knights are &s;carcely able to re&s;train their neighing &s;teeds."</P>
<P>"We delay to conquer," an&s;wered Tott; "let this fir&s;t flame &s;ub&s;ide which burns &s;o high, yet &s;preads but little ruin round it."</P>
<P>Slow and determined, like a dark cloud which bears the vengeful lightning in its brea&s;t, he march|ed again&s;t the trembling foe.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="037753_0029_100F44459A367EB8">
Uffo, Tott's valiant &s;on (who had already &s;hared in many a fight the glory of his father), led a cho|&s;en troop of warriors through the valley, and waited for the &s;ignal of attack, that he might fall upon the enemy when lea&s;t expected, and &s;trike the da&s;tard hirelings with di&s;may.</P>
<P>Canfried, meanwhile, attended by his Knights, flew from one wing of his army to the other, bel|lowing to each that he &s;hould recollect his duty, and endeavouring to revive the drooping courage of his followers by the hope of plunder.</P>
<P>But what can &s;ervile avarice avail again&s;t the arm which is fighting for its native land? Already had the &s;word of the Norwegians forced a pa&s;&s;age through the Swedi&s;h ranks; already had Tott &s;pread de&s;olation round him; already had Swend bur&s;t into the throng, and piled a mountain of his &s;laughtered foes upon the plain; already was Uf|fo's armour &s;prinkled with Swedi&s;h gore; al|ready the groans of the dying mounted towards heaven. Canfried &s;aw, trembled, and gna&s;hed his teeth. In vain did he roar till he was hoar&s;e, to rally the retreating cowards. In vain did he cur&s;e the hour of his birth, Odin, and the habitation of the Gods. Almo&s;t inevitably lo&s;t, De&s;pair added vigour to his arm, and hovered above him with
<PB N="32" REF="037753_0030_100F4447D1B29420">
her &s;ooty wings. Impetuous he ru&s;hed into the thicke&s;t troops of the Norwegians, followed by a &s;quadron of ra&s;h daring youths; they hewed their way with the de&s;tructive &s;word, until they reached the place where Swend's blue plume high nodded in the air.</P>
<P>"Art thou here," cried Canfried, in a voice of thunder, "thou cradle-warrior, who ha&s;t dared to match thy&s;elf with me? Advance thou fiery &s;tripling, nor crouch inglorious thus beneath the bucklers of thy Knights! Advance, and meet a man!"</P>
<P>"Welcome! welcome," cried Swend, "thou whom in the heat of battle I &s;o long have &s;ought. Hither, thou ravi&s;her! The &s;tripling &s;hall cha&s;ti&s;e thee."</P>
<P>He loo&s;ed the reins, and ru&s;hed towards Can|fried; but his &s;taunch companions (who had averted many a dangerous blow, and who&s;e num|ber was now much decrea&s;ed) threw them&s;elves between the combatants, and cried&mdash;</P>
<P>"No, you &s;hall not &s;take your life again&s;t a vil|lain's, who di&s;graces his own crown, and wi&s;hes to &s;teal your's. He is no more a Knight. Call one of our baggage-boys, that he may fell him with a tent-&s;taff to the earth."</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="037753_0031_100F444B016475E8">
Foaming with fury, Canfried bellowed to the remnant of his army&mdash;</P>
<P>"Advance! advance! Revenge this in&s;ult of|fered to your King."</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, a confu&s;ed multitude, con&s;i&s;t|ing of &s;ome hundreds, fell on the twenty valiant Knights, who&s;e brea&s;ts were as a wall to their Monarch. Not one gave way&mdash;not one fell, with|out taking five of his enemies to &s;erve him in Val|hall<NOTE N="16">Such were the tenets of the Runic doctrine in &s;ome coun|tries, though, in others, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that the warriors did not take their enemies to Valhall as &s;ervants, but only their &s;culls as cups. See Note (8).</NOTE>. But now the mob, which &s;till increa&s;ed and fought with blind de&s;pair, had &s;lain the la&s;t, and Swend remained alone, at a di&s;tance from his army, whither his youthful intrepidity had led him.</P>
<P>"Yield, yield," cried Canfried, "that I may yoke thee to my chariot, and thus triumphantly proceed to Ildegerte's ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>Swend's &s;word made his reply. Canfried with great agility eluded the attack, and aimed a migh|ty &s;troke at his antagoni&s;t, which glided down his poli&s;hed armour. A furious combat now began between the tyrant of Sweden and the father of Norway. The youths in Canfried's retinue ru&s;hed again&s;t the &s;olitary King, to drag him from his charger; but two old Knights, the only two in whom the honour of their order &s;till remained,
<PB N="34" REF="037753_0032_100F444D3540B890">
threatened to &s;lay the fir&s;t who dared to lay hands upon him. They formed a circle round the com|batants, ca&s;t a furious look upon their da&s;tard countrymen, and maintained the laws of war.</P>
<P>Like lightning flamed the &s;words of the con|tending rivals. Ildegerte and a kingdom were to be the victor's prize. Canfried &s;aw both; Swend, Ildegerte only. The combat long continued doubt|ful, for &s;kill and courage fought again&s;t de&s;pair and madne&s;s. But now, as Canfried rai&s;ed his &s;word, in order to conclude the conte&s;t by one deadly blow, Swend perceived an opening where the armlets fa&s;ten to the cor&s;let. He dexterou&s;ly par|ried the de&s;cending &s;troke, and in a moment would his &s;word have forced a pa&s;&s;age to the ty|rant's heart, when a vile a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in from behind &s;truck him with a mace upon the head. He fell prone from his hor&s;e, and &s;treams of blood came gu&s;h|ing from his throat. One of the old Swedi&s;h Knights flew the villain on the &s;pot, bent down to Swend, and opened his vi&s;or. His features &s;wam in blood&mdash;his eye was broken.</P>
<P>"A good Prince finds his reward in the arms of a Valkyrie."</P>
<P>The&s;e were the la&s;t words he uttered through his &s;ighs. He was laid acro&s;s his &s;teed, and &s;lowly
<PB N="35" REF="037753_0033_100F444EC50DC320">
taken from the field of battle; but ere he reached the neighbouring &s;pring, at which the Knight had purpo&s;ed to refre&s;h him, he expired.</P>
<P>"Swend is dead!" cried Canfried to his troops. "The day is our's. Back to the battle!"</P>
<P>"Swend is dead!" exclaimed the flying army, and returned.</P>
<P>"Swend is dead!" was heard on every &s;ide. "With him fell the courage of the Norwegians."</P>
<P>Alas! too true!</P>
<P>"Swend is dead!" whi&s;pered each va&s;&s;al to his comrade; "vani&s;hed is the plume which nodded at our head."</P>
<P>"Swend is dead!" &s;aid each Knight to his neighbour.</P>
<P>The dire intelligence &s;oon reached the old intre|pid Tott, who &s;till was &s;preading carnage through the plain.</P>
<P>"Follow me, children," &s;aid he with utter|ance half-choaked, "avenge the death of your King and benefactor."</P>
<P>But in vain did he once more ru&s;h into the heat of battle; but a few hundreds followed him. Hor|ror and grief had overpowered the almo&s;t conquer|ing army. The Norwegians fled in wild di&s;order from the field, and thou&s;ands fell a prey to the de|vouring

&s;words of their pur&s;uers. Tott, with only a &s;mall, but valiant band, retreated to a hill, and there maintained his po&s;t again&s;t the united force of Sweden.</P>
<P>"Where is Uffo, my &s;on?" &s;aid he to the Knight &s;tanding neare&s;t to him. "Is my &s;on Uffo too among the fugitives?"</P>
<P>"No, venerable Chief," replied the warrior, "he fell, covered with wounds, amid the fight."</P>
<P>"Did&s;t thou &s;ee him?" demanded Tott; "Were his wounds in front?"</P>
<P>"All in his brea&s;t, and on his head," returned the Knight.</P>
<P>"Odin be prai&s;ed!" exclaimed old Tott. "Let us fight to-day; to-morrow we will mourn."</P>
<P>He &s;poke, and opened his vi&s;or to regain his breath, when lo! a fatal arrow came hi&s;&s;ing through the air, pierced his right eye, and tum|bled the la&s;t prop of Norway to the earth. A faint groan from all his followers accompanied the hero's fall. The &s;word dropped from every feeble hand, and every arm &s;unk impotently down. Yet none would be obliged to the victorious robber for his life, and Canfried towered the plain with car|ca&s;es.</P>

FLY, my &s;pirit, far, far from the fatal plains, drenched in the blood of heroes!&mdash;Why &s;hould&s;t thou tarry with the dead?&mdash;No longer great and valiant deeds can &s;ignalize the field, for Tott, and Swend, and Uffo are no more. Lead me, &s;oft Fancy, lead me to the &s;ilent bower, where, in the &s;hadowy twilight, Ildegerte received the me&s;&s;en|ger who came to announce to her the King's at|tachment.</P>
<P>"Art thou a me&s;&s;enger of peace?" cried &s;he ha&s;tily, as he approached, and knelt with rever|ence before her.</P>
<P>"From the King's hand I have received this letter," an&s;wered he, "with orders to deliver it to Ildegerte."</P>
<P>"Tell me," demanded &s;he, "how did&s;t thou leave the camp? Is Canfried's band of robbers vanqui&s;hed? Has Odin cha&s;ti&s;ed the traitor?"</P>
<P>"When I left the camp," replied the me&s;&s;en|ger, "the Scalds were chaunting hymns; the Knights were clo&s;ing their vi&s;ors; the armour was cla&s;hing; the en&s;igns were flying, and the trumpet's bla&s;t proclaimed the attack."</P>

"Oh! then is our King perhaps already victo|rious," exclaimed &s;he, "and with the pangs of un&s;ucce&s;sful villany, Canfried has retreated from our borders."</P>
<P>With the&s;e words &s;he opened the letter. She read&mdash;her cheek coloured. She read further&mdash;her cheek glowed. She clo&s;ed the letter, and a tear trembled in her &s;parkling eye.</P>
<P>"Leave me," &s;aid &s;he, in a friendly tone, to the me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t willingly, fair lady," an&s;wered he; "but do not long delay your an&s;wer, for the King awaits me with anxiety."</P>
<P>"With anxiety!" repeated &s;he, blu&s;hing. "How do&s;t thou know that?"</P>
<P>"Oh! he commanded me a hundred times," returned the me&s;&s;enger, "to out&s;trip the wind in &s;peed. He &s;aid the me&s;&s;age was of con&s;equence, and every minute dear to him. Nay, after I was mounted and had left the camp, I &s;till could hear his voice de&s;iring me to ha&s;ten; and when I looked far behind me from the dale, I &s;pied him &s;tanding near his tent, and with his hand above his eyes, &s;till watching me."</P>
<P>"Enough! enough!" &s;aid Ildegerte, much af|fected, "go, feed thy hor&s;e, refre&s;h thy&s;elf;&mdash;

<P>The me&s;&s;enger went. Ildegerte &s;unk upon her knees, and prayed&mdash;</P>
<P>"Oh Thora! now immortal, who, when about to quit mortality, did&s;t call me daughter; if, amid the joys of Vingolf, thou &s;till can&s;t feel a happy mother's joys&mdash;if the name of Swend remain &s;till dear to thee, Oh reveal thy&s;elf to Ildegerte! If I be unworthy of thy &s;on's bed, bani&s;h from my heart this growing pa&s;&s;ion. Let me fly into &s;ome de&s;ert, and lament my fate, which made me not the daughter of a King."</P>
<P>She cea&s;ed, and with eyes &s;wimming in tears, &s;urveyed the ri&s;ing moon. Hark! a gentle even|ing breeze &s;wept through the leaves; the blo&s;&s;oms &s;hed their odours all around; the nightingale, warbled in plaintive &s;olitary notes. Ildegerte's heart was full. The &s;olemn twilight filled her mind with dark pre&s;ages. With wild affrighted looks &s;he ha&s;tened through the wood, and hid her|&s;elf in the mo&s;t lone&s;ome chamber of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the prating me&s;&s;enger had been re|lating to the curious females, who &s;urrounded him, all that he knew about the letter&mdash;or knew not; all that Swend had &s;aid to him&mdash;or not &s;aid.
<PB N="40" REF="037753_0038_100F445B4B55DEE8">
He had increa&s;ed the King's anxiety a hundred fold; a hundred times repeated Swend's eagerne&s;s for his return, and at la&s;t, with all the air of wi&s;|dom, he ob&s;erved&mdash;</P>
<P>"It mu&s;t be &s;ome great project of the King which my weak intellects cannot di&s;cover; but perhaps Ildegerte may give you further informa|tion."</P>
<P>Heavens! what bu&s;tle, and what whi&s;pers now took place! At length the fair a&s;&s;embly agreed that they knew nothing, and re&s;olved that at &s;upper the &s;ecret &s;hould be drawn from Ildegerte; or that, if her &s;ilence was invincible, they &s;hould at lea&s;t read it in her countenance.</P>
<P>The wi&s;hed-for hour arrived. All eyes were turned on Ildegerte, as &s;he entered the &s;aloon, with her u&s;ual air of friendly maje&s;ty. She was recovered; the gentle glow of hope &s;hone on her dimpled cheek. They &s;at to table. All was &s;ilence;&mdash;all was li&s;tening expectation, while Ildegerte (not remarking this &s;ilence, or this expectation) talked with indifference to all. One coughed; another trod upon her neighbour's foot; a third winked to a fourth, and none dared to &s;peak. But towards the conclu&s;ion of the meal, Ildegerte addre&s;&s;ed them, and every hand, about to lift the mor&s;el to the mouth, &s;unk motionle&s;s upon the lap.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="037753_0039_100F445D9625F7B8">
"You, my dear companions, have, in this ca&s;|tle, for many months, with me lamented Thora.

<P>She cea&s;ed, and, &s;oftly blu&s;hing, ca&s;t her eyes upon the earth. A&s;toni&s;hment had chained the tongues of her companions; but &s;oon they ro&s;e tran&s;ported, &s;urrounded Ildegerte with care&s;&s;es, and paid homage to their Queen.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned that here and there an envious glance was &s;een, but Ildegerte under&s;tood that art &s;o difficult to be acquired, of always maintaining a &s;erenity of temper; and thus her &s;ilent dignity and friendly look &s;ubdued the proude&s;t heart. During the fir&s;t hours devoted to re&s;t, not one of all the dam&s;els clo&s;ed her weary eyes; each ima|gination was &s;o full of all the events by which this la&s;t was cau&s;ed, that it &s;purned the hand of Sleep when it &s;eemed to offer the bal&s;am of repo&s;e.</P>
<P>'Twas well for you, good &s;ouls! For why this &s;hort repo&s;e? Already do the &s;hrieks of horror rend the air, and draw full near your ca&s;tle-gates: already do the groans di&s;turb the midnight &s;ilence: already does the cry of murder echo through the

wood. The dwarf upon the tower thrice blew his horn. The guards rou&s;ed them&s;elves from &s;leep, and ha&s;tened to the portal, again&s;t which the approaching wretches thundered.</P>
<P>"Who thus di&s;turbs our nightly re&s;t?"</P>
<P>"Open! open to your brethren!"</P>
<P>"Speak! who are you?"</P>
<P>"Conquered wounded fugitives."</P>
<P>"Whence come you through the darkne&s;s of the night?"</P>
<P>"From the field of battle. We have marked the path by which we came with the blood that trickles from our wounds.&mdash;Odin, Odin has pro|nounced de&s;truction on the land! Swend is dead, Uffo is fallen, Tott is in Valhall!"</P>
<P>"De&s;truction, de&s;truction upon you, ye me&s;|&s;engers of evil!"</P>
<P>All was confu&s;ion through the ca&s;tle. Que&s;|tions, &s;hrieks, and cries for arms were heard on every &s;ide. Ildegerte alone was calmly &s;leeping in the arms of Hope. The gentle &s;mile of rewarded virtue dimpled her virgin cheek. Her companions, with di&s;hevelled hair, now bur&s;t into the chamber.</P>
<P>"Awake! awake!" cried they, "thy &s;leep is death."</P>
<P>Ildegerte &s;prung affrighted from her couch.</P>

"What has happened? Is the ca&s;tle in flames? Or has &s;ome traitor opened our gates to the ene|my?"</P>
<P>In vain did &s;he a hundred times repeat the que&s;|tion. Horror had robbed the females of their &s;en&s;es; they could make no reply but by weeping, groaning, and tearing their hair. Ildegerte there|fore threw a garment round her, &s;eized a taper, and with winged foot&s;teps traver&s;ed the vaulted galleries, through which the di&s;tant cries a&s;&s;ailed her ear. Now her foot &s;truck again&s;t a corp&s;e, and now her wandering eye e&s;pied upon the floor a wounded man, who held with both his hands his bleeding &s;ide, and &s;eemed already &s;eized by Hela.</P>
<P>"Who art thou?" cried Ildegerte, &s;huddering.</P>
<P>"One who fights with Death for Valhall's joys," &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"How came&s;t thou here?" demanded &s;he. "What hand inflicted this deadly wound?"</P>
<P>"The hand of a Swede," an&s;wered he. "Swend is dead, Uffo is fallen, Tott is in Valhall!"</P>
<P>"Avenging Gods!" &s;tammered forth Ildegerte.</P>
<P>The taper dropped from her hand, and &s;he &s;unk, devoid of &s;trength, again&s;t the wall. But &s;oon her fleeting &s;pirits were recalled by the groans of the dying warrior. She crept to her chamber, &s;ecured
<PB N="44" REF="037753_0042_100F446394EA0100">
the entrance, and threw her&s;elf upon the floor. There long &s;he laid, nor &s;hed a &s;ingle tear, nor heaved a &s;ingle &s;igh. This moment of dread|ful &s;tupefaction pa&s;&s;ed away. She drew Swend' letter from her bo&s;om, and her eye fell upon the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"Then, Ildegerte, drop a tear upon my early grave; lament the lo&s;s of a brother&mdash;of a hu&s;|band."</P>
<P>A &s;udden flood of tears came to her relief.</P>
<P>"My brother! my hu&s;band!" cried &s;he, in a voice half choked by &s;obs.</P>
<P>No more could &s;he &s;tammer forth; but in the&s;e two names her overflowing heart combined all the &s;hadows of her pa&s;t happine&s;s, with all the &s;miling pro&s;pects of her future bli&s;s, which Fancy, a few hours before, had painted to her.</P>
<P>Overpowered by angui&s;h, and almo&s;t drowned in tears, laid Ildegerte, till the ruddy morn co|loured the ca&s;tle's turrets. She awoke from the frenzy of de&s;pair, ju&s;t as the ri&s;ing &s;un ca&s;t his fir&s;t beams upon the lance and &s;word, which, &s;ince Thora's death, had ru&s;ted in a lone&s;ome corner.</P>

"I promi&s;e it," an&s;wered Ildegerte.</P>

<P>He placed the helmet on her head.</P>
<P>"Brace on thy armour," added he, "and mount thy charger; for thou art appointed an avenger. My eyes grow dim. My &s;trength is ex|hau&s;ted. Odin, I thank thee!

<P>Never had &s;uch heroic fire glowed in the brea&s;t of man. Ildegerte felt a new being. Unuttera|ble &s;trength was &s;hed upon her. Revenge had &s;ubdued the gentlene&s;s of love, and love added fuel to revenge.</P>
<P>"You are witne&s;&s;es," cried &s;he, after the old Knight had left the hall, "your are witne&s;&s;es that I am ordained an avenger. This very day will I depart to fulfil my appointment.

<P>The heroic ardour was not long confined within the ca&s;tle's walls. It echoed through the wood, and flew upon the wings of wind to the next town, where many a wife wept over the a&s;hes of her hu&s;band, many a mother over the bones of her &s;on. All dried their tears, tore helmet, mail, and &s;word from the much-loved &s;lain, and armed them&s;elves to fight under Ildegerte's banner. Swift flew the news into the land.

<P>"Swend, thy kin&s;man, is no more. He is murdered by the villany of Canfried. All the Nobles of Norway are de&s;troyed.

<P>Upon the &s;wifte&s;t hor&s;es the amba&s;&s;adors pur|&s;ued their way to Denmark's borders; while Il|degerte advanced towards the enemy, who, fear|le&s;s of attack, were di&s;per&s;ed over the country, laying wa&s;te the fields, plundering the cottages, and murdering infancy and age.</P>

<P>The &s;cattered bands, of late engaged in murder and in rapine, ere long returned affrighted to the camp. Ildegerte's out po&s;ts had &s;eized part of the robbers, and the re&s;t had fled to announce the enemy's approach.</P>

<P>Beneath a canopy, maje&s;tically leaning on her lance, Ildegerte received the herald, who brought this letter.</P>
<P>"Thank the law of nations," &s;aid &s;he to him, "that I do not puni&s;h in the me&s;&s;enger the audacity of the libertine who &s;ent him. Bring a &s;ack hither; throw &s;ome filthy dog into it, and deliver it to this man.

But, let them revert to tho&s;e rude ages, in which barbari&s;m was extolled as virtue, and delicacy of &s;entiment condemned as effeminacy. A &s;cabby or mangy dog (for this is my author's expre&s;&s;ion, though, from deference to the feelings of tho&s;e above-mentioned, I have render|ed it in terms <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> unexceptionable as I could, without forfeiting the meaning of the original), is a pre&s;ent, mentioned more than once in Gothic hi&s;tory, and was often &s;ent as a kind of playful de|fiance. Let the&s;e nice ladies, then, call to mind the &s;pirit and manners of tho&s;e times, and if they be not &s;uperfine indeed, Ilde|gerte will lo&s;e nothing in their eyes.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>With the&s;e words &s;he turned her back to the trembling me&s;&s;enger, and went to prepare her faith|ful friends for the deci&s;ive hour.</P>
<P>"What! not yet humbled!" cried Canfried, with ferocious mien. "Still that proud contempt with which I was accu&s;ed of having &s;tolen thy &s;andals! Fall then a &s;acrifice to thine ob&s;tinacy. Alive I'll catch thee, and my va&s;&s;als &s;hall deflour thee."</P>
<P>Towards evening, Canfried &s;ent a &s;econd herald to the camp.</P>
<P>"To-morrow," thus ran his me&s;&s;age, "&s;hall the ri&s;ing &s;un be witne&s;s of my triumph. Arm thy|&s;elf,

<P>A &s;mile was Ildegerte's an&s;wer&mdash;a forced &s;mile upon her countenance, and dark pre&s;ages of the future in her &s;oul. She could not to her&s;elf deny, that her &s;mall band was too weak to contend with an enemy thrice as numerous; and that the cou|rage and intrepidity of a few troops ha&s;tily collect|ed, were not a match for &s;kill and di&s;cipline. Her Amazons, indeed, had devoted them&s;elves to death, and &s;he her&s;elf would think it happine&s;s to die for him, who died for her. 'Twas not the fear of death that made her tremble, but the thought of going to Valhall, where the old Knight perhaps might meet her with the que&s;tion, "Ha&s;t thou fulfilled thy oath?" Then to be obliged to an&s;wer, "No," although a gaping wound in her brea&s;t ex|cu&s;ed that No&mdash;this, this alone&mdash;</P>
<P>"Oh Father of the Gods!" exclaimed &s;he, with eyes &s;wimming in tears, "this evening is perhaps the la&s;t of my exi&s;tence. If thou ha&s;t de|creed that the battle of to-morrow &s;hall decide for ever the &s;lavery of my country, Oh! at lea&s;t per|mit me, in the heat of action, to find the villain

Hurl him not to Niflheim's everla&s;t|ing darkne&s;s; allow him not the &s;mall con&s;olation of &s;uffering with many thou&s;ands: take him to Valhall, where he will be the only &s;ufferer, that, in the happine&s;s of him whom he per&s;ecuted, in the bli&s;s of him whom he murdered, he may feel the bittere&s;t of agonies."</P>
<P>Thus prayed Ildegerte, in who&s;e heart the thir&s;t for vengeance had choked the milder &s;en&s;ations of female gentlene&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;tars already &s;parkled in the &s;ky; Ildegerte &s;ent me&s;&s;engers from tent to tent.</P>
<P>"Refre&s;h your&s;elves," &s;aid they; "let the cup of joy pa&s;s round, and re&s;t till &s;un-ri&s;e. Then brace on your armour, pray to the Gods, and &s;ally forth upon the plain, for to-morrow is the deci&s;ive day."</P>
<P>The troops obeyed; they filled the horn, and drank to a happy meeting in Valhall.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Ildegerte a&s;cended the hill, upon which the moon &s;hone in awful maje&s;ty, erected a &s;mall altar, and &s;acrificed to the God of war. Hel|ga, one of her deare&s;t companions, followed her.</P>
<P>"Let me," &s;aid &s;he, with &s;i&s;terly affection,
<PB N="62" REF="037753_0060_100F448DD635C698">
"reveal to you my doubts and fears. You did not act wi&s;ely in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing Canfried's me&s;&s;enger &s;o &s;cornfully."</P>
<P>"And what would Helga have done?" de|manded Ildegerte.</P>
<P>"You have &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Theodoric, King of Denmark," rejoined &s;he. "Fame &s;peaks loudly in the prai&s;e of this young hero, but our re|venge is not his revenge, nor our impatience his. Allowing that he accedes to your reque&s;t; granting that he is allured by the pro&s;pect of an empty throne, and takes up arms to gain a &s;econd crown, not being &s;ufficiently oppre&s;&s;ed by the weight of one; &s;till, what can you expect from this? The deci&s;ive hour approaches. Pray to Odin that he will be&s;tow wings upon Theodoric's army. We mu&s;t conquer without him, or die without him; for, at all events, the King of Denmark will come too late."</P>
<P>"And what do you infer from all this?" a&s;ked Ildegerte.</P>
<P>"That you would have done better," replied Helga, "had you, for a little while, ca&s;t away the&s;e manly arms, and u&s;ed the arms which Na|ture grants to all our &s;ex&mdash;cunning and deception. You might have detained Canfried's me&s;&s;enger for

a few days with promi&s;es, and then given &s;ome equivocal reply, &s;ome gleam of hope. By this mode we &s;hould have gained time&mdash;have gained every thing."</P>
<P>"You are right," returned the heroine; "but for the murderer of her hu&s;band, Ildegerte has but one reply. To have left Canfried in the &s;up|po&s;ition (were it but the &s;uppo&s;ition of a moment) that my ear was open to his vile propo&s;als, would have been a breach of my oath, would have been trea&s;on to the &s;hadow of our King. No! Of this not a word more. Let us remain true to our ho|nour, and die."</P>
<P>"I admire your courage, but not your policy," &s;aid Helga.</P>
<P>"As you plea&s;e," rejoined Ildegerte. "I have li&s;tened to, and an&s;wered your objections as a friend; I now, as your Chief, command &s;ilence. The morning begins to dawn; our moments are counted. Go; leave me to my devotions. Climb to the &s;ummit of the hill, and ob&s;erve the Swedi&s;h camp. As &s;oon as you perceive the enemy in mo|tion, call to me, that we may de&s;cend, and wake our friends."</P>
<P>Helga went. Ildegerte &s;acrificed and prayed. The border of the ea&s;tern cloud was tipped with gold.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="037753_0062_100F4491B5DFB7B0">
"Do you &s;ee nothing, Helga?" demanded Il|degerte.</P>
<P>"A death-like &s;ilence reigns around," &s;aid &s;he; "I hear nothing but the warbling of the early lark."</P>
<P>Ildegerte prayed fervently. The &s;moke from the altar a&s;cended towards heaven. The outward edge of the &s;un appeared in the horizon. Ildegerte re|peated her que&s;tion.</P>
<P>"I &s;ee," returned Helga, "a few men &s;cattered here and there through the camp of the enemy. They are leading their hor&s;es to the water."</P>
<P>"The time draws near," &s;aid Ildegerte.</P>
<P>She rai&s;ed her hands and eyes towards heaven, and prayed aloud. The &s;un ro&s;e in full maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>"What do you now &s;ee, Helga?" a&s;ked &s;he.</P>
<P>"I &s;ee," an&s;wered Helga, "a thick cloud of du&s;t far in the we&s;t. I &s;ee the glittering of &s;pears far as my eye can reach."</P>
<P>"In the we&s;t!" exclaimed Ildegerte. "Does your imagination deceive you?"</P>
<P>"Come your&s;elf, and &s;ee," replied Helga.</P>
<P>The heroine mounted the hill. Before her eyes appeared an innumerable army. The &s;un ca&s;t his beams upon their poli&s;hed helmets. Already was her ear a&s;&s;ailed by the neighing of their &s;teeds, and the cla&s;hing of their arms.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="037753_0063_100F4494E75DA6E8">
"Heavens!" cried Ildegerte; "we are lo&s;t. Odin has given life to &s;tones in order to yoke our mi&s;erable country!"</P>
<P>"See how they &s;pread from &s;ide to &s;ide," con|tinued Helga; "the wood &s;cems to be alive. Still, &s;till fre&s;h troops appear."</P>
<P>"De&s;cend! de&s;cend!" &s;houted Ildegerte. "Thunder to our warriors. Let us die at lea&s;t with &s;word in hand."</P>
<P>They ru&s;hed together down the hill, and lo! the amba&s;&s;adors who had been &s;ent to &s;ue for aid from Denmark, met them.</P>
<P>"Whither," exclaimed Ildegerte, "whither &s;o quick? What means this breathle&s;s ha&s;te? Who are the countle&s;s troops advancing from the we&s;t?"</P>
<P>"The troops of Denmark," an&s;wered they, "of our liberater and avenger. But a day's march from our camp, beyond the wood we found him, at the head of thirty thou&s;and warriors. Long had Fame announced to him the danger that threat|ened this kingdom, yet did the news of our late Monarch's death force tears from his eyes. He is a friendly Prince, and &s;eems a gallant Knight. He commends him&s;elf to your &s;ervices, and &s;ays, he hopes to know you better. You mu&s;t immediately

Odin grant &s;ucce&s;s to your arms!"</P>
<P>They bowed to the earth, and joyfully ha&s;tened down the hill to communicate the tidings, and with them courage through their little camp. What &s;houts of tran&s;port echoed from every &s;ide! The amba&s;&s;adors were inclo&s;ed, and lifted in the air, while grateful ble&s;&s;ings were poured upon Theodoric. The cries of joy floated to the enemy acro&s;s the plain. Stunned with horror, they be|held the innumerable &s;pears, and burni&s;hed armour glittering in the &s;un-beams Long Ildegerte &s;tood immoveable. With uplifted hands, and the tear of gratitude &s;parkling in her eye, &s;he looked towards the habitation of the Gods. At length &s;he threw her&s;elf into Helga's arms&mdash;</P>
<P>"Now, dear friend, thou &s;ee&s;t Odin is ju&s;t. His thunder &s;eems to &s;leep, but &s;uddenly the vil|lain feels its force. The hour of vengeance is ar|rived."</P>

She &s;poke, and ha&s;tened to the troops, who re|ceived her with loud acclamations. Already were they mounted on their chargers; mighty con&s;i|dence beamed upon every countenance, and each with eagerne&s;s awaited the third &s;ound of the trum|pet, the &s;ignal of attack.</P>
<P>Towards the le&s;t, as Theodoric commanded, Ildegerte led her valiant troops, who followed her with &s;ongs and jubilee, as if to tournaments and &s;ports. Not far from Canfried's camp, &s;he order|ed them to halt, and with rapture heard the fir&s;t &s;ound of the trumpet.</P>

come. Norway is my hereditary right, nor will I ever &s;hare it with a robber."</P>
<P>The herald faithfully delivered his me&s;&s;age, and Ildegerte heard the &s;econd &s;ound of the trumpet. De&s;pair &s;tretched her &s;able pinions over Canfried's head. The centinels &s;tole one by one from his tent, and he, on who&s;e nod, but ye&s;terday, the lives of thou&s;ands hung, remained alone.</P>
<P>"Is it then re&s;olved?" cried he, foaming with fury. "Mu&s;t all my high premeditated &s;chemes be bla&s;ted in their bud?&mdash;Ah! then &s;hall my death at lea&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h me from this ba&s;e herd of flying da&s;tards. Pale and agha&s;t, po&s;terity &s;hall hear how Canfried fell. Ri&s;e, demons of Niflheim! Cloud my &s;en&s;es, that I may ru&s;h impetuous on their &s;words, and &s;eek the girl who tears the lau|rels from my brow.&mdash;What is this that boils with|in me? In vain do ye torment me, &s;en&s;ations, termed by the vulgar, pangs of con&s;cience: in vain does the bloody recollection of my &s;ins attempt to torture me.&mdash;Thou phantom, called Virtue, I die without knowing thee. Oh, how wretched is he, who&s;e mi&s;ery ari&s;es from his own crimes! My heart is my accomplice, and my executioner. But I will not feel that I am wretched. Death is my hope, and life my puni&s;hment. Cur&s;ed be thou,

Odin! I hate my&s;elf. I hate mankind! Away to death! Down, down to hell!"</P>
<P>Furious he ru&s;hed forward, and &s;aw part of his flying army far away.</P>
<P>"There the cowards fly!" cried he. "Is there then no one who will die with his King?"</P>
<P>He looked round. His eye fell upon an old Knight, who was attentively &s;urveying the &s;tump of an oak, which had been lately felled. It was the &s;ame old Swede who &s;lew the murderer of Swend, and led the dying Prince to a neighbour|ing &s;pring, for the purpo&s;e of refre&s;hing him.</P>
<P>"What art thou doing here?" demanded Can|fried.</P>
<P>"I am ob&s;erving this tree," replied the Knight.</P>
<P>"Is it &s;o remarkable a &s;ight that it can make thee forget thine own &s;afety?" a&s;ked the King.</P>
<P>"It is indeed remarkable," an&s;wered the Swede. "But ye&s;terday its top defied the hurricane."</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand thee," returned the tyrant, "but even in his fall &s;hall Canfried &s;till be Canfried. Go. Fly, and leave me to my fate."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall not fly," &s;aid the Knight.</P>
<P>"Thou &s;ee&s;t we are for&s;aken," rejoined Can|fried.</P>
<P>"I am not for&s;aken," an&s;wered he.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="037753_0068_100F44A075F264F0">
"Not for&s;aken!" exclaimed the King. "On whom do&s;t thou place thy hope?"</P>
<P>"On God and my arm."</P>
<P>"On God!" cried Canfried, &s;huddering.</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid the Knight, with a look of firm|ne&s;s towards heaven, "on God."</P>
<P>"And on thy arm?" continued Canfried, re|covering. "A &s;ingle arm again&s;t two armies?"</P>
<P>"I know how to die," returned the Knight.</P>
<P>"I know it too," exclaimed the King; "I will not &s;urvive the dreadful hour which robs me of my glory, to be bound in ignominious chains, and dragged before a woman's throne. Here," proceed|ed he, drawing his &s;word, "take this, and obey thy Monarch's la&s;t command:&mdash;Stab me."</P>
<P>"Never!" replied the veteran.</P>
<P>"I will die," &s;aid Canfried, "by the hand of a friend and a Knight. Take it and &s;trike."</P>
<P>"Heaven forbid," rejoined he, "that I &s;hould &s;tain my hands with the blood of my King! Thus far we are not as yet degraded. Let the&s;e hirelings fly. The better half of thy army &s;till remains immoveable; and though it be not equal to the enemy in numbers, &s;till many a valiant Knight defends thy cau&s;e. Advance, my Liege! Shew thy&s;elf at the head of thy warriors, and if thou mu&s;t die, die in battle like a Knight."</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="037753_0069_100F44A2058B1CF8">
"'Tis well!" cried the tyrant. "Follow me. Seas of blood &s;hall pay for every drop of mine, and if Odin grant me victory to-day, I'll build a temple, and confe&s;s aloud&mdash;there is a God."&mdash;</P>
<P>He ha&s;tily vaulted on his charger, and flew to collect the &s;cattered troops, which fear and cow|ardice had left him.</P>
<P>The warlike trumpet &s;ounded the third time; Ildegerte heard it with a beating heart, courage|ou&s;ly brandi&s;hed her &s;word, and ru&s;hed at the head of her Amazons again&s;t the ho&s;tile &s;quadrons. At the &s;ame moment, like a thick wood, the lances of the Danes forced their way. At their head fought, with glowing ardour, Theodoric the King, and Prince Harold, his favourite. A cloud of ar|rows darkened the &s;un. Amid the din of war, the neighbouring cataract was heard no more. In vain did the de&s;pairing tyrant atchieve prodigies of valour. The heaps of &s;lain increa&s;ed around him every in&s;tant; every in&s;tant numbers for&s;ook him, and begged their lives as they fled from the field.</P>
<P>"'Tis done!" cried Canfried, with gha&s;tly fu|ry; "I have reached the goal of my career. Black demons of Niflheim! dying, I devote my&s;elf to you. Help, help me to find the woman, whom I

once &s;o ardently wi&s;hed to po&s;&s;e&s;s. My love is con|verted into fury. She refu&s;ed a Monarch's bed; be &s;he my companion on the bed of death!"</P>
<P>Wildly he rolled his eyes around the field, in &s;earch of Ildegerte. Ildegerte &s;ought him, and &s;oon they met. An involuntary tremor thrilled through Canfried's frame, when, by the crowned lion, he recognized, on Ildegerte's head, Swend's royal helmet.</P>
<P>"Has hell belched thee forth?" cried he, rai&s;|ing his ma&s;&s;y &s;abre to conclude the combat with one deadly blow.</P>
<P>Ildegerte, unequal to him in &s;trength, but more nimble, e&s;caped the threatening &s;troke, which glanced down her poli&s;hed armour. Now, as he rai&s;ed his arm a &s;econd time, &s;he &s;pied the opening in his cor&s;elet, and before his &s;troke de&s;cended, plunged her &s;word into his bo&s;om to the hilt. Bellowing, he fell at his hor&s;e's feet. Black &s;treams of gore ru&s;hed down his armour, and de|filed the gra&s;s. With the mo&s;t dreadful cur&s;es upon Ildegerte, and bla&s;phemy upon his dying tongue, he vomited his impious &s;oul.</P>
<P>This combat decided victory for Norway, and re&s;tored her liberty. All that could fly, fled, and tho&s;e, who &s;aw no way open, fell on their knees,
<PB N="73" REF="037753_0071_100F44A7B8970F80">
ca&s;t away their arms, and threw them&s;elves upon the genero&s;ity of their conquerors.</P>
<P>The old Knight, alone, by who&s;e hand Canfried had wi&s;hed to die, had fixed him&s;elf again&s;t the &s;ame tree, which, a few hours before, had foretold to him his Monarch's fate; and with &s;word in hand defended him&s;elf again&s;t the increa&s;ing multitude. Him Theodoric di&s;covered at a di&s;tance, &s;prung forward, and di&s;per&s;ed his troops, who were ba&s;ely fighting again&s;t a &s;ingle man.</P>
<P>"Yield!" &s;aid he, to the almo&s;t exhau&s;ted Knight. "Look round; thou art alone. How comes this youthful ra&s;hne&s;s in a veteran's brea&s;t?"</P>
<P>"'Tis becau&s;e I am a veteran," replied he, "that I do not wi&s;h to &s;urvive the lo&s;s of this day's battle. But I yield to thee on one condi|tion."</P>
<P>"Name it," returned Theodoric.</P>
<P>"Let me bear away the body of my King, and go in peace to give it honourable burial."</P>
<P>"Did&s;t thou love thy King?" demanded the young Monarch.</P>
<P>"He was my King," an&s;wered the Swede, "and I did my duty."</P>
<P>"Enough!" &s;aid Theodoric, much affected, "thy petition is granted."</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="037753_0072_100F44AA0DC3A2C8">
"I have made no petition," replied he; "I have but required of thee what I (were thy body lying at my feet) &s;hould not deny to one of thy Knights."</P>
<P>"Go then in peace," returned Theodoric, tak|ing his gauntlet off, "but not ere thou ha&s;t given the King of Denmark thy hand."</P>
<P>"I thank thee," an&s;wered the Knight, &s;haking his hand, "and in return, young hero, accept the hone&s;t coun&s;el of a man in years. Let not thy conque&s;t make thee arrogant. Let the example of Canfried be ever pre&s;ent to thee, and teach thee how much &s;tronger a defence than &s;word and mail, is&mdash;the love of thy people."</P>
<P>"I promi&s;e," &s;aid the young King, "to fol|low thy in&s;tructions. Come with me to my Court, and witne&s;s it."</P>
<P>"No," replied the Swede, "I have a native home, and two infant grand-children."</P>
<P>"Let me then, at lea&s;t, take thy friend&s;hip with me," &s;aid Theodoric.</P>
<P>"Thou ha&s;t it," rejoined he.</P>
<P>Thus they parted. The body of Canfried was laid upon a carriage, and &s;lowly borne towards the borders of his kingdom. No lamentation filled

the towns through which it pa&s;&s;ed. No tear moi&s;t|ened the &s;and which covered it.</P>
<P>Scarce had Ildegerte fulfilled her oath as an avenger; &s;carce did &s;he &s;ee that nothing now re|mained but to bind her temples with the wreath of victory, than &s;he left the field of battle, ac|companied by Helga only, ha&s;tened to the camp, climbed the hill, which had &s;moked with her &s;a|crifice on the preceding night, and offered the fir&s;tlings of her gratitude to Odin. As &s;he went to rid her&s;elf of her armour, &s;he was met by The|odoric and the Nobles of his Court, among whom was Prince Harold. With reverence the King alighted from his hor&s;e, and acco&s;ted Ildegerte in the&s;e words&mdash;</P>
<P>"To you, valiant lady, belong my thanks, and the thanks of your country. Receive them in &s;ight of the whole army, and allow me and my retinue to behold your face."</P>
<P>Ildegerte humbly an&s;wered&mdash;</P>
<P>"My Lord and Sovereign! your genero&s;ity is plea&s;ed to a&s;cribe to me what, without your pow|erful a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I had never effected. You are the deliverer of my native land. Allow Ildegerte to be the fir&s;t who does homage to you."</P>
<P>She opened her vi&s;or with downca&s;t eyes, and
<PB N="76" REF="037753_0074_100F44ADD704DA50">
mode&s;tly knelt at his feet. How enchanting was her appearance! How maje&s;tic the air added to her figure by Swend's helmet, from which a few ringlets had &s;tolen into &s;ight! How negligently beautiful the belt with golden fringe, that hung from her &s;houlder! Theodoric and his courtiers were a&s;toni&s;hed. The former almo&s;t forgot the rules of courte&s;y, rai&s;ed her with a trembling hand, &s;tammered forth a few &s;yllables, and ki&s;&s;ed her forehead. Ildegerte, however, &s;eemed not in the lea&s;t to have ob&s;erved the impre&s;&s;ion &s;he had made on the a&s;&s;embly, and withdrew to her tent, in order to exchange her armour for a female dre&s;s.</P>
<P>THINK not, mi&s;taken mortals, to e&s;cape the inviting dangers, which &s;o often co&s;t you happine&s;s and peace. It is from them only that the &s;pace of many years, of many miles cannot protect you. Your enemy is your heart, and if you never had a conte&s;t, you have had no enemy. In our bo&s;oms we all bear a great enchanter, who can make old men young, and beggars Kings. Oh! if we knew not love and death, what could convince the haughty man that he is but a man?</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="037753_0075_100F44B063E44350">
King Theodoric returned to his pavilion, not as he had left it. Every object &s;eemed beautiful and fair, for in every object he beheld Ildegerte.</P>
<P>Prince Harold returned to his pavilion, not as he had left it. All was to him unaccountable va|cuity, for his heart was full&mdash;was full of Ildegerte.</P>
<P>It is time to &s;ketch, with a few light touches, the characters of the&s;e two royal youths.</P>
<P>Theodoric was young and inexperienced, open to every impre&s;&s;ion, ea&s;ily deceived, and ea&s;ily led a&s;tray. He had a warm e&s;teem for every good and noble action, yet often mi&s;took the outward appear|ance of good and noble, for reality. In every in|&s;inuating &s;mile he &s;aw a friend, into who&s;e arms he threw him&s;elf without con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Harold was older and more &s;ubtle, pliant and re&s;erved, ambitious and voluptuous. He had the look of calmne&s;s with a boiling heart. He had a countenance, which, as the times required, a&s;&s;umed each ma&s;k. He was pious with the pious, and &s;coffed with the free-thinker. He had once made an attempt to revive an ancient right to the crown, and his impotence alone re&s;trained him within the bounds of a &s;ubject. In vain did many an aged coun&s;ellor, who looked into futurity, warn Theo|doric to di&s;mi&s;s this dangerous rival from his throne.
<PB N="78" REF="037753_0076_100F44B347CEB010">
To policy Theodoric &s;eldom li&s;tened, for he thought it too much at variance with humanity; and Ha|rold knew how to &s;ilence all &s;u&s;picion in a way &s;o crafty&mdash;knew &s;o artfully how to adopt every hu|mour, that to the un&s;u&s;pecting Monarch his &s;oci|ety &s;oon became indi&s;pen&s;ible.</P>
<P>Propped on his hand, Theodoric &s;at, recalling to his mind with rapture every motion of the hero|ine; and ruminating upon every word that &s;he had uttered.</P>
<P>With folded arms, with long and ha&s;ty &s;teps, Harold mea&s;ured his pavilion, fabricating &s;chemes compo&s;ed of love and of ambition.</P>
<P>Let us &s;urpri&s;e them both. Let us fly, &s;wift as thought, from tent to tent. Lend your right ear to the love-&s;ick &s;ighs of Theodoric, and your left to the daring plots of Harold:&mdash;</P>

<P>Such were the &s;oliloquies of both.&mdash;Theodoric di&s;patched a page to Ildegerte, to enquire whether &s;he had need of re&s;t after her fatigues, or if he might have the honour of an audience.</P>
<P>Harold, on his part, had &s;tationed &s;pies to watch each foot&s;tep which approached Ildegerte.</P>
<P>In the meantime, the page brought to Theodo|ric the wi&s;hed-for an&s;wer, that his vi&s;it would be acceptable. With throbbing heart, and the glow
<PB N="81" REF="037753_0079_100F44BA53514448">
of love upon his cheek, he entered her tent, and was received with great politene&s;s. The youth gazed at her full blue eye in mute a&s;toni&s;hment. She had ca&s;t away her armour; her auburn tre&s;&s;es were bound in a braid, and no longer buried be|neath the helmet, which had covered her maje&s;tic forehead. In a long white robe, encircled at her &s;len|der wai&s;t by her blue girdle, which was tied at her left &s;ide, from whence its ends, bordered with &s;ilver fringe, hung negligently down; with a hand &s;o fair and &s;oft, as if intended only for love's pre&s;|&s;ure, not to gra&s;p the &s;word, &s;he &s;at oppo&s;ite the King, bewitching as the godde&s;s of youth and beauty, who, but a few hours before, had &s;eemed the godde&s;s of revenge and war. It was an elo|quent pau&s;e, with which the conver&s;ation opened. Theodoric's looks &s;poke, and Ildegerte involunta|rily ca&s;t down her eyes.</P>
<P>Since the creation of the world, it has been the cu&s;tom, when one has nothing, or any thing of con&s;equence to &s;ay, to begin with a remark on the good or bad weather; which ever be the ca&s;e, the tran&s;ition always takes place by a cough. The|odoric too, pointed out, by &s;tammers, to Ildegerte, the delightful day, which even the tenth month of the year afforded them. Ildegerte agreed with
<PB N="82" REF="037753_0080_100F44BC936AEE98">
him, and that &s;ubject was at an end. The tran&s;i|tion-cough now followed. Purple cheeks gave no|tice that the confe&s;&s;ion was approaching; downca&s;t eyes announced it, and fingers, which inadvert|ently played with the points of Ildegerte's girdle, accompanied it as interpreters. The mo&s;t inno|cent girl feels an inward &s;en&s;ation ari&s;e from the&s;e &s;ymptoms, which calls to her&mdash;"Be on thy guard. The enemy approaches."</P>
<P>"Angelic woman!" began Theodoric; "you have conquered friend and foe&mdash;the foe by your arm, the friend by your eye."</P>
<P>Ildegerte blu&s;hed; and, as u&s;ual on &s;uch occa|&s;ions, a&s;&s;umed the appearance of not having un|der&s;tood his meaning.</P>
<P>"Your Maje&s;ty &s;peaks in enigmas," an&s;wered &s;he.</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible," exclaimed the King, "that you alone know not the power of your charms? You had a heart for revenge," proceeded he, &s;eiz|ing her hand, "have you then none for love?"</P>
<P>"You either banter me, or forget your&s;elf," replied &s;he, withdrawing her hand.</P>
<P>"The former were an in&s;ult," &s;aid Theodoric, "the latter in your pre&s;ence very po&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>"You may mean what you &s;ay," returned &s;he,
<PB N="83" REF="037753_0081_100F44BE1CB00A38">
"yet &s;omewhat odd it &s;ounds in the mouth of a man but ju&s;t retired from battle."</P>
<P>"Surely not," ob&s;erved the King, "unle&s;s you take the heat of blood for love. For, in what other re&s;pect does the emotion of a &s;oul, af|ter a battle, re&s;emble that &s;weet &s;en&s;ation? But &s;ay, what do you call love?"</P>
<P>"Go, a&s;k the prie&s;ts in the temple of their Godde&s;s," rejoined Ildegerte. "I am not initi|ated, and know her only from the poems of our bards."</P>
<P>"Can fal&s;hood dwell in &s;uch a form?" cried Theodoric. "Am I ignorant that Swend&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I know what you would &s;ay," returned &s;he, interrupting him. "In his arms I hoped to have learnt it. Till now I have felt but gratitude to|wards him. It was the impul&s;e to all that I have done. But I have been told, that to love is but ano|ther &s;tep; and, without a blu&s;h, I own my heart was re&s;olved to take that &s;tep."</P>
<P>"Ildegerte," replied the young Monarch, "may I hope for your friend&s;hip?"</P>
<P>"Whatever is valuable in my friend&s;hip," an|&s;wered &s;he, "I give you willingly."</P>
<P>"Enough!" exclaimed he, again &s;eizing her
<PB N="84" REF="037753_0082_100F44C059324970">
hand. "From friend&s;hip to love is likewi&s;e but a &s;tep."</P>
<P>"A &s;tep improper both for you and me," re|joined Ildegerte.</P>
<P>"You," &s;aid Theodoric, &s;omewhat hurt, "now banter me, or forget your&s;elf. For indifference I was prepared, but not for contempt."</P>
<P>"Hear me then," returned &s;he. "It were pru|dery any longer to affect an ignorance of your meaning. I under&s;tand your looks and words. But does it become you, the King of Denmark and Norway, in the mid&s;t of your victorious ca|reer, upon the path of glory, to &s;ue for a wo|man's heart, who has no other dowry than her vir|tue? You are Lord over your realms, yet is your heart their &s;lave, and mu&s;t never be your advi&s;er. Subdue this flighty pa&s;&s;ion. The daughters of Princes wait for you, and Kings de&s;ire you for a &s;on-in-law. You will make powerful alliances. The name of Theodoric will be revered by your neighbours, and the ba&s;is of your throne will be immoveable."</P>
<P>"My throne," replied Theodoric, "is founded on the love of my &s;ubjects; and who is better able to augment this love than Ildegerte? For, even when I hear you &s;peak, I fancy my&s;elf in the
<PB N="85" REF="037753_0083_100F44C35108DED0">
mid&s;t of my &s;enators. Such exactly are their arguments."</P>
<P>"You are paying me the greate&s;t compli|ment," an&s;wered &s;he, "perhaps without intend|ing it."</P>
<P>"Right!" &s;aid he. "Ildegerte, you have ca&s;t away &s;word and mail. Be once more quite a wo|man. Think you not that I bear enough when my head &s;u&s;tains the crown? Mu&s;t it al&s;o pre&s;s upon my heart?"</P>
<P>"You belong entirely to your people," rejoin|ed &s;he.</P>
<P>"'Tis well!" exclaimed Theodoric; "I make the people judges between you and me. Let them decide whether they know one more worthy of the throne&mdash;whether they will have any other Queen."</P>
<P>"Not &s;o," returned Ildegerte. "You ought to &s;ee clearly even if your &s;ubjects be blind. Be|lieve me, my friend (for by that name I will mo&s;t willingly addre&s;s you), when the fir&s;t ardour of your youthful pa&s;&s;ion had &s;ub&s;ided, you would &s;ee but too clearly. Then, what a wretch &s;hould I be! I entreat you, Theodoric, to be &s;atisfied with my e&s;teem."</P>
<P>"What you have ju&s;t &s;aid," an&s;wered he, "I
<PB N="86" REF="037753_0084_100F44C585B73DD8">
hope you did not mean it, was bla&s;phemy to Lou|na, and trea&s;on to your charms. No never&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here the good King was ju&s;t about to pour forth a &s;olemn declaration of his pa&s;&s;ion, accom|panied by oaths, &s;ighs, tears, and vows; and my reader would, without mercy, have been obliged to li&s;ten to them, word for word, had not Prince Harold, as if called for, entered the tent, to in|form his Maje&s;ty, that a large body of Swedes had been &s;een beyond the river, and that he had judged it expedient to double the guard. In reality it was a mere pretext; for this large body melted by degrees into a &s;core of &s;traggling fugitives. His &s;pies had informed him that Theodoric had been &s;een alone, and in deep meditation, wandering to Ildegerte's tent. The conver&s;ation had already la&s;ted half an hour, without the pre&s;ence of a third. Enough for a mi&s;tru&s;tful heart! enough to rou&s;e the &s;eeds of jealou&s;y! Harold therefore ha&s;tened to interrupt a vi&s;it, which wore an ap|pearance &s;o &s;u&s;picious.</P>
<P>The King, unplea&s;ant as it was to be &s;urpri&s;ed at this deci&s;ive moment, obeyed the duties of the public weal, and, accompanied by the Prince, left the tent. Ildegerte remained alone, with a per|plexity
<PB N="87" REF="037753_0085_100F44C7100EE6A0">
and timidity about her heart, which &s;eemed not exactly to agree with her late politic advice.</P>
<P>Harold, meanwhile, made every indirect endea|vour to draw the &s;ecret from the King. But with Theodoric there was no need of circumlocution. His open heart offered to the traitor what he had but expected as the reward of artifice.</P>
<P>"Kin&s;man," began he, with a hearty &s;hake of the hand, "oft ha&s;t thou &s;een me roving, like a bee, from flower to flower. I thought my&s;elf hap|py, and perhaps was happy. But my hour at la&s;t is come. I love. I love with an ardour unfelt before, which &s;eems to &s;tretch my heart beyond its limits. Would that I could make the whole world happy!"</P>
<P>"It almo&s;t &s;eems to me," an&s;wered Harold, "that there is no occa&s;ion to reque&s;t a name which your vi&s;it has betrayed to me."</P>
<P>"True," replied Theodoric; "the charms of Ildegerte only could have chained this fickle heart. Sure Odin &s;ent her from a better world, to give us a foreknowledge of tho&s;e heavenly joys&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Hold! hold!" cried Harold. "This you mu&s;t tell her&s;elf, before the enthu&s;ia&s;tic fire evapo|rates; or, probably you have already done it?"</P>
<P>"I &s;carce know what I told her," &s;aid the
<PB N="88" REF="037753_0086_100F44CA49A91D30">
King; "nothing very wi&s;e, I dare &s;ay. What &s;he an&s;wered, I know better. The noble girl re|fu&s;ed a crown."</P>
<P>"What!" exclaimed Harold. "Is it po&s;&s;ible that love can have led you &s;o far a&s;tray, as to make you offer your crown to the daughter of a Knight?"</P>
<P>"The daughter of a Knight!" repeated Theo|doric; "What mean'&s;t thou? Had blind Fate &s;natched another lot from Fortune's urn, this Knight as ea&s;ily had been a King, as ea&s;ily a beg|gar. Still Ildegerte had been Ildegerte."</P>
<P>"But, pardon me," rejoined the Prince, "is it not your duty to con&s;ult the wi&s;hes of your &s;ub|jects, and the welfare of the &s;tate?"</P>
<P>"Thou too can&s;t talk like my old unfeeling &s;ena|tors," replied Theodoric. "The wi&s;hes of my &s;ubjects!&mdash;My &s;ubjects adore Ildegerte. The wel|fare of the &s;tate! What can be more profitable to the &s;tate than to be&s;tow on it a Queen, who&s;e wi&s;|dom will &s;hare with me the load of government, who&s;e valour will &s;upply to me the place of an ex|perienced Chief? Our kin&s;man, Swend, thought thus. Him Thora formed, and blindfold will I follow his example."</P>
<P>"Not if Love bind the bandage on your eyes," &s;aid Harold. "Mo&s;t willingly would I a&s;&s;i&s;t you
<PB N="89" REF="037753_0087_100F44CC838F77F0">
in this plan, were it the only one which gained you what you wi&s;h. But why ab&s;olutely make a Queen of her?"</P>
<P>"Peace!" cried Theodoric, "I tremble even to imagine what thou art about to &s;ay. For &s;hame!"</P>
<P>"But&mdash;"proceeded Harold.</P>
<P>"Not another word," rejoined the King. "I am re&s;olved. To-morrow, &s;oon as propriety allows, go to Ildegerte. Summon all your rhetoric, Ha|rold. Paint to her, in glowing colours, all I feel, yet am not able to expre&s;s. A third can do it bet|ter. To-morrow &s;he mu&s;t explain, and will too, I dare be &s;worn. Go; &s;peak as a friend. I, mean|while, will act as a lover."</P>
<P>Harold was &s;ilent; for he feared, by further op|po&s;ition, to betray him&s;elf. He went, and felt, as the hawk would feel, if forced to replace the &s;tolen pigeon in its ne&s;t. He threw him&s;elf upon his couch, and &s;lept&mdash;little. With plea&s;ure would he have re-animated every Swede, who&s;e body was &s;tretched upon the plain, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to quench the blazing fire of love in the King's bo&s;om, by the hurry of battle. With plea&s;ure would he have recalled the fugitives, gathered their &s;cattered bands, in&s;pired them with temerity, and
<PB N="90" REF="037753_0088_100F44CEC14C2F10">
urged them to a nocturnal &s;urpri&s;e. But as the flight of the vanqui&s;hed enemy forbade him to indulge &s;o frivolous a hope, and as he had to no effect racked his brain for a pretext, and to&s;&s;ed upon his couch till the morning watch; what re|mained but to &s;mile upon the wheel, to cur&s;e the pa&s;t, and await from futurity what the pre&s;ent mo|ment &s;natched away.</P>
<P>"Why do I torment my&s;elf?" cried he, &s;pring|ing up. "If I cannot enjoy Ildegerte, I may the Queen of Denmark and Norway. Let fools fea&s;t upon the idle fancy that the fir&s;t embrace is mo&s;t delicious. What excites this &s;illy wi&s;h in man?&mdash;Vanity. The idea that he is the fir&s;t who awakes the&s;e &s;en&s;ations in the girl. Well, be it &s;o, if I be but the fir&s;t who make her wi&s;h for the&s;e once unknown &s;en&s;ations. 'Tis a mighty leap from the prattling of a child to the chaunting of a bard, yet mu&s;t I learn the former ere I can under&s;tand the latter. Succe&s;s to thee, Theodoric! Teach the girl to prattle, while I tune my harp."</P>
<P>Thus did the vain fool con&s;ole him&s;elf with the plans, hatched by his heated brain, while the young King, in&s;pired by ardent love, made prepa|rations in the camp throughout the night, which I &s;hall not di&s;clo&s;e to you, reader, that when you
<PB N="91" REF="037753_0089_100F44D04CDCF800">
have long enough puzzled your&s;elf in vain, I may &s;urpri&s;e you, as Theodoric &s;urpri&s;ed the object of his affection.</P>
<P>Now, when the morning dawned, too late for the impatience of the King, too early for the Prince's jealou&s;y, Harold &s;lowly crept to Ildegerte's tent, and enquired of the females, who guarded it without, whether &s;he might be &s;poken to &s;o early.</P>
<P>"Whether by you, Prince, I know not," re|plied one of them, "but her friend Helga has been with her &s;ince break of day."</P>
<P>"Natural enough!" grumbled Harold. "Ilde|gerte, with all her valour, is but at la&s;t a woman. She mu&s;t have her confidante. The conque&s;t of hearts flatters female vanity but little, unle&s;s the mouth be allowed to blazon it, or at lea&s;t to whi&s;|per it in the ear of this, and that, under an in|junction of &s;ecrecy.&mdash;Go, girl," &s;aid he aloud, "and announce me."</P>
<P>The Amazon went, while the Prince, full of choler, &s;tamped into the earth the harmle&s;s dai&s;ies that grew around the tent.</P>
<P>Ere long, Helga appeared in a light morning dre&s;s, and beckoned to Harold that he might ap|proach. He found Ildegerte, with her head prop|ped upon her arm. She appeared to have had but
<PB N="92" REF="037753_0090_100F44D297D5C6B0">
little re&s;t, and the faint &s;mile upon her countenance &s;eemed almo&s;t forced.</P>
<P>"Oh how happy were the King!" began Ha|rold, approaching her with a familiar air, "had he any &s;hare in this meditative po&s;ture!"</P>
<P>"How &s;trange," an&s;wered &s;he, &s;miling, "that the fir&s;t word of man to woman mu&s;t always be a compliment! What a mean opinion mu&s;t you en|tertain of us! Well, yes; I was thinking of the King."</P>
<P>"Then would I bet," replied Harold, "that the alluring pro&s;pects of futurity engaged your thoughts."</P>
<P>"You would lo&s;e your wager," returned Ilde|gerte.</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed the Prince. "After all that Theodoric is ready to do for you?"</P>
<P>"'Tis true," &s;aid &s;he, "that you are &s;peaking to a woman&mdash;to a woman who is not free from the weakne&s;&s;es of her &s;ex; but I never yet knew the tortures of ambition."</P>
<P>"You are right," an&s;wered Harold. "A crown has greater charms when from the hand of love."</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t moment's love," rejoined the hero|ine, "is but the &s;un-beam which awakes the &s;eed.
<PB N="93" REF="037753_0091_100F262322916D20">
Whether there be a la&s;ting &s;tem, or tran&s;ient flower, contained within it, who can now determine? And who would venture to build a hut, in the hope that from this &s;eed would grow a tree to over&s;hade his hut?"</P>
<P>"Truly," &s;aid Harold, "if you can moralize thus, you are not in love."</P>
<P>"Who told you that I was in love?" demanded Ildegerte.</P>
<P>"So much bravery without ambition!" cried he. "So much beauty without love! Since I fir&s;t knew that I had feelings, I have con&s;idered the&s;e two pa&s;&s;ions as the grand &s;upports of life.&mdash;A crown, and a beauteous woman! He who offers &s;uch rewards, may pile rocks upon rocks, and in|crea&s;e each drop of rain into a &s;tream. I &s;corn the rocks, and laugh at the &s;treams. I climb to the goal, or &s;ink to the bottom, and die in the at|tempt."</P>
<P>"If &s;uch be your ideas," returned Ildegerte, "I pity you. Ambition towers aloft, but deep is the aby&s;s to which it leads. Sweet is the draught which Love pre&s;ents, but the bitter is at the bot|tom."</P>
<P>"There let it &s;tay then," replied Harold. "To
<PB N="94" REF="037753_0092_100F44D88F9E5A20">
empty the cup would be exce&s;s, and exce&s;s creates di&s;gu&s;t."</P>
<P>"True it is," proceeded Ildegerte, "that were I, in the &s;torms of life, obliged to place reliance on one of the&s;e two pa&s;&s;ions, I &s;hould prefer love to ambition."</P>
<P>"Indeed!" exclaimed Harold. "Thanks, Il|degerte, that you have not quite broken the &s;taff which &s;upports me; that it is but the throne which you refu&s;e, and not the man who &s;its upon it. A heart, which loves you&mdash;a heart which knows no other wi&s;h than to po&s;&s;e&s;s you&mdash;a faithful heart may hope at la&s;t to move you. I revive. Without a crown and &s;ceptre, I may contend for preference with him who bears them. I may hope&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Nothing may you hope," rejoined &s;he, "nor any other. I am free, and value my freedom. Prince, if you came hither in your own name to found me, our di&s;cour&s;e is at an end; but if you came in the King's name, tell him that I have con|&s;idered the offer made by him ye&s;terday, that I ho|nour him as my King, e&s;teem him as my friend, and love him as my brother. Tell him to be &s;atis|fied with the&s;e declarations of Ildegerte, who is free. Were &s;he no longer free, &s;he would glory in her chains, but dreadful indeed would be her
<PB N="95" REF="037753_0093_100F44DA19B0DFB0">
lot, if ever forced to break them. Theodoric is an excellent young man, with a heart devoid of guile, but &s;oft as wax. Who could be an&s;werable for his fidelity?"</P>
<P>"I!" cried the King, &s;uddenly throwing him|&s;elf at her feet; "I, who will &s;ell my life for a broken arrow, my throne for a cup of poi&s;on, if Ildegerte refu&s;e to &s;hare both with me. Why, beauteous woman, why this &s;u&s;picion, &s;o di&s;grace|ful both to you and me? Have you then but one perfection to bind me for ever to you? Is it your beauty only which has captivated me? Oh wi&s;dom and virtue, powerful and everla&s;ting ties of feeling &s;ouls, &s;till will ye be new and fa&s;cinating, when wrinkles long have furrowed this full cheek, and when the&s;e auburn locks have long been grey. Sweet girl! oppo&s;e me no longer. De&s;pi&s;e my crown, but not my heart."</P>
<P>Ildegerte was &s;urpri&s;ed, and felt her&s;elf kindly di&s;po&s;ed towards the graceful youth, who was laying at her feet. With a gentle and half-tender look, &s;he reached her hand to him, and &s;tammer|ed forth&mdash;</P>
<P>"Ri&s;e, Theodoric, and leave me alone."</P>
<P>"Not till I can call this hand my own," re|turned he; "not till I have &s;ealed the affiance on
<PB N="96" REF="037753_0094_100F44DBA4F8F740">
your lips.&mdash;Approach, E&s;cill; the moment is ar|rived."</P>
<P>E&s;cill, one of Theodoric's mo&s;t illu&s;trious Chiefs, entered the tent; in both hands he held a cu&s;hion of purple &s;ilk, bordered with golden fringe; upon the cu&s;hion laid a crown, glittering with pre|cious &s;tones. E&s;cill bent his knee, and at the &s;ame moment martial mu&s;ic &s;truck the ear. The tent fell, and Ildegerte, with a&s;toni&s;hment, beheld the whole army drawn up in battle array, with en|&s;igns floating in the air, and &s;pears &s;parkling in the &s;un-beams. She heard the loud and joyful &s;hout&mdash;</P>
<P>"Long live Queen Ildegerte!"</P>
<P>She was no longer able to command her heart. She &s;unk into Theodoric's arms, and hid her glow|ing cheeks in his throbbing bo&s;om. He pre&s;&s;ed her to his heart, &s;eized the dazzling crown, and placed it on her head.</P>
<P>Not far from them &s;tood a triumphant carriage, decked with flowers and ribands. Four &s;now-white &s;teeds pranced at its thill, and &s;norted as they obey|ed the golden rein of the nervous charioteer. The enviable youth lifted the prize of love with tran&s;|port into the carriage, and &s;lowly pa&s;&s;ed the front of his troops, that he might &s;hew his happine&s;s to
<PB N="97" REF="037753_0095_100F44DED8F9D838">
every va&s;&s;al. The army received him with loud acclamations. The kettle-drums rolled, the trum|pets clanged, but louder than both, echoed the joyful cry&mdash;</P>
<P>"Long live Queen Ildegerte!"</P>
<P>When they reached the &s;mall band of Amazons, the carriage was &s;urrounded, the traces cut, and a thou&s;and times a thou&s;and hands drew the lovers to the altar of Siona<NOTE N="24">Siona or Sio&s;na, the Godde&s;s of wedlock.</NOTE>. There waited a hoary-headed Prie&s;t, who&s;e knife &s;till &s;moked with the blood of the recent &s;acrifice. He prayed to Odin, ble&s;&s;ed the couple, and received the oath of ever|la&s;ting love and fidelity. A &s;umptuous banquet, by the light of a thou&s;and torches, clo&s;ed the fe&s;|tive day. The &s;weet &s;mile of &s;atisfaction &s;hone on every countenance but one;&mdash;Harold's alone was gloomy and contemplative. The veil of night &s;hrouded the happy pair. Theodoric found bli&s;s and heaven in Ildegerte's arms.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="037753_0096_100F44E10E63AB88">
OH! that I were here allowed to ca&s;t away my pen! Oh that I might not wake you from the &s;weet idea that virtue had pa&s;&s;ed, enjoying its re|ward, and &s;urrounded by unfullied bli&s;s, even to to the grave!</P>
<P>Alas! our &s;orrows and our happine&s;s are all a dream, and from this ec&s;tatic vi&s;ion was Ildegerte to be rou&s;ed to mi&s;ery and horror.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES. VOL. I</HEAD>
<P>(1) ODIN, al&s;o called Woden, Father of the Gods. He, his wife Freya, and &s;on Thor, compo&s;e the &s;upreme council of hea|ven. He is called the Univer&s;al Father, The Terrible and Severe God, The King of Slaughter, The God that carrieth De&s;olation and Fire, the Active and Roaring Deity, The Giver of Victory, &amp;c. The fourth day of the week is con&s;ecrated to him, and there|fore called Woden's day.</P>
<P>(2) Frea, or Freya, wife of Odin, and mother of the inferior Deities. The&s;e names are, by &s;ome, a&s;cribed to two Godde&s;&s;es, the former being Queen of the Gods, and the latter, &s;i&s;ter of Erey. To her the &s;ixth day of the week is con&s;ecrated.</P>
<P>(3) Vingolf, the man&s;ion of Love and Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>(4) Utgarda Loke, an evil &s;pirit, nearly re&s;embling our devil. He is de&s;cribed in the Edda (or Bible of the Northern nations) as exceeding hand&s;ome, but crafty and per&s;idious. He is called, The Artificer of Fraud, The Calumniator of the Gods, &amp;c. He, neverthele&s;s, dwelt in Heaven, till, as a puni&s;hment for his re|peated crimes and attacks upon the Gods, they chained him to three &s;harp &s;tones, which are for ever cutting his fle&s;h; while a &s;erpent, hanging over him, di&s;tils its venom, drop by drop, upon 
<PB N="100" REF="037753_0098_100F44F172427098">
his face. In this &s;ituation he is to remain till the de&s;truction of the world.</P>
<P>(5) The wolf Fenris, a &s;on of Utgarda Loke. He was bred among the Gods; but they, being warned by oracles that he might one day become fatal to them, re&s;olved to confine him. No chains, however, could be forged which were &s;trong enough to hold him. At length a dwarf, in the land of the Black Ge|nii, &s;upplied Odin with a bandage of uncommon &s;trength. Go|ran&s;on's de&s;cription of its texture is &s;o ludicrous, that I am in|duced to tran&s;cribe it:</P>
<P>"Hic nervus &s;ex con&s;tabat rebus; &s;trepitu nempe pedum felis, ex barb&acirc; mulieris, radicibus montium, nervis ur&s;inis, halitu pi&s;|cium, &amp; &s;puto avium."</P>
<P>"This &s;tring con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix things, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the noi&s;e made by a cat's feet, the beard of a woman, the roots of mountains, the nerves of bears, the breath of fi&s;hes, and the &s;pittle of birds."</P>
<P>Having bound the wolf with this cord, they drew it through a huge rock, to which he is doomed to be confined till the la&s;t day, when he is to break loo&s;e, and devour the &s;un.</P>
<P>(6) The &s;erpent of Midgard, one of Utgarda Loke's children, and an enemy of the Gods. Odin threw him to the bottom of the ocean, where he grew &s;o large, that he wound him&s;elf around the whole globe of earth.</P>
<P>(7) Scald, the name given to the ancient bards, who were em|ployed to compo&s;e odes and hymns, which were chaunted at every &s;olemnity. The&s;e &s;ongs were, in general, de&s;criptions of eminent exploits, and were animated by an enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit.</P>
<P>(8) Valhall, the palace of Odin, to which warriors are con|veyed after death. Here they pa&s;s their mornings in tournaments and battles; the re&s;t of the day is employed in fea&s;ting on the
<PB N="101" REF="037753_0099_100F26E3EB98ACD0">
wild boar Serimner (which, though dre&s;&s;ed every morning, be|comes entire again every night), and in quaffing Hydromel (or mead), which is admini&s;tered to them in the &s;culls of tho&s;e ene|mies whom they had &s;lain while on earth.</P>
<P>(9) Gefione, the Godde&s;s of Cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>(10) Noffa, the daughter of Frea, a Godde&s;s of &s;uch exqui|&s;ite beauty that whoever is lovely and hand&s;ome, or whatever is precious, is called by her name.</P>
<P>(11) Vora, the Godde&s;s of Prudence and Wi&s;dom, who is &s;o penetrating, that nothing can remain hidden from her.</P>
<P>(12) Lo&s;na, or Louna, the Godde&s;s who a&s;&s;i&s;ts lovers, and makes up differences between them and married per&s;ons, be they ever &s;o much at variance.</P>
<P>(13) Valkyries, Virgins who are &s;ent by Odin into the field of battle, to in&s;pire the warriors, to make choice of tho&s;e who are to be &s;lain, and to alleviate the pangs of death. They are like|wi&s;e employed in attending on the heroes who inhabit Valhall.</P>
<P>(14) Hela, or Death, the daughter of Utgarda Loke. She was precipitated into Niflheim by Odin, and there had the go|vernment of nine worlds given to her.</P>
<P>(15) Vara, the Godde&s;s who receives all oaths, and puni&s;hes tho&s;e who violate them.</P>
<P>(16) Such were the tenets of the Runic doctrine in &s;ome coun|tries, though, in others, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that the warriors did not take their enemies to Valhall as &s;ervants, but only their &s;culls as cups. See Note (8).</P>
<P>(17) Thor, the elde&s;t &s;on of Odin, the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t in|trepid among the Gods. He is &s;aid, by &s;ome, to launch the thunder of Odin, and to be principally con&s;ulted in heaven rela|tive to the deci&s;ion of victory. He always carries a mace or club,
<PB N="102" REF="037753_0100_100F26E5A65439B0">
which he gra&s;ps with gauntlets of iron; and which, as often as he di&s;charges it, returns immediately to his hand. He is al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a girdle, which has the virtue of renewing his &s;trength as often as is needful. The fifth day of the week (Thor's day) is con&s;ecrated to him.</P>
<P>(18) Frey, the milde&s;t of all the Gods. He pre&s;ides over the &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and be&s;tows fertility.</P>
<P>(19) Niord, the God of Winds, who checks the fury of the &s;ea, &s;torms, and fire.</P>
<P>(20) Lyna, the Godde&s;s, to who&s;e care are committed tho&s;e whom Frea intends to deliver from peril.</P>
<P>(21) Niflheim, or Hell, literally &s;ignifying Evil-Home.</P>
<P>(22) Odin's golden bucklers. The Edda tells us, that Gylfe, King of Sweden, went di&s;gui&s;ed to A&s;gard, the court of the Gods, and there &s;aw the&s;e bucklers.</P>
<P>"Tunc cernebat ille palatium. Tecta ejus erant tecta aureis clypeis."</P>

<P>OH how bli&s;sful are the fir&s;t enjoyments of pure love! how cele&s;tial the tran&s;ports of rewarded fidelity! The heart, (which even in the intoxica|tion of gratified ambition, &s;till creates new wi&s;hes) calmly &s;inks to re&s;t, &s;eeming as if it could never feel another want, and as if the whim of fickle Fortune had bound with garlands each deceitful ball which pa&s;&s;es over us. Rapturous vi&s;ion! To the feeling mortal life derives its only charm from thy delu&s;ive richly-coloured images. And &s;ure 'tis in our power to prolong this &s;weet illu&s;ion till al|mighty Death &s;hall lead us from the arms of love to tho&s;e &s;ublimer joys, of which that we may be partakers, our Creator will be&s;tow upon us finer organs. Yes 'tis in our power; but heaven-born wi&s;dom only can convert the cloying &s;amene&s;s of the embrace to a clear &s;tream of ever-flowing bli&s;s. He who has devoted the day to his duties and the god|de&s;s

Wi&s;dom, will every evening find happine&s;s in the arms of his wife, and Love with bounteous hand will &s;hed upon him from his horn unfaded flowers. But this &s;oft harmony of &s;ouls will not be found in bu&s;tling courts and &s;plendid palaces. There all is di&s;&s;ipation; even love is di&s;&s;ipation; not the mild and grateful hour, which re-animates the faculties for Wi&s;dom's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t weeks that followed the &s;olemnization of the nuptials flew upon the wings of Joy to the abode of Love, there to announce the happine&s;s and gratitude of the young couple. Banquets, tournaments, and fe&s;tive dances had their daily turn. From far and near ha&s;tened the flower of Knighthood to the gay metropolis. All crowded to the throne of the fair Queen, and he, who had but once &s;een Ildegerte &s;mile, returned contented to his home, fea&s;ting on the fond anticipation of relating to his grand-children the happy times of his youth. What a lovely being! what a fa&s;cinat|ing &s;weetne&s;s animated every word and look of the young Queen! There was not a heart which &s;he did not &s;ubdue. When &s;ome talkative old man de&s;cribed to her the length and breadth of his whole life (intere&s;ting to him alone), when, as he &s;poke, his youthful fire once more in&s;pired him, and
<PB N="5" REF="037753_0105_100F27124DBAEC50">
&s;parkled in his &s;unken eye, Ildegerte li&s;tened with mode&s;t attention and without interruption, as if the relation contained all that was amu&s;ing and in&s;tructive. The old man departed, extolling her&mdash;"The Queen is an excellent woman; &s;he reveres old age."</P>
<P>When &s;ome old Knight's good wife, ble&s;&s;ed by Heaven with more children than under&s;tanding, &s;at at her &s;ide, yawning and lending only half an ear to the recital of battles and atchievements, Il|degerte &s;oon knew how to loo&s;e her tongue. She a&s;ked after her &s;ons and daughters, received in|&s;tructions in hou&s;ehold management, and in idea vi&s;ited the kitchen. The wife, well plea&s;ed, re|turned at evening to her hu&s;band, and exlaim|ed&mdash;</P>
<P>"Our Queen is an excellent woman, mindful of what &s;he was, and what &s;he is!"</P>
<P>When the young jocund couples &s;kimmed through the mazy dance, and, forgetting amid their plea&s;ure the etiquette of Court, made the air tremble with their exclamations, Ildegerte joined them, and far from correcting their playful plea|&s;antry by regal pomp, &s;he left a le&s;&s;on to one of the be&s;t of princes, who in later years &s;ucceeded to the crown of Denmark<NOTE N="1"><P>FREDERIC the Second, King of Denmark, when &s;ome|times tired of court-formality, u&s;ed to &s;ay&mdash;
"The King's from home."</P>
<P>In a moment every one gave way to uncontrolled amu&s;ements; but as &s;oon as Frederic exclaimed&mdash;
"The King's returned."</P>
<P>The whole Court was at once rein&s;tated within the bounds of etiquette.</P></NOTE>, that one may &s;ome|times
<PB N="6" REF="037753_0106_100F271562F595C0">
de&s;cend from the throne, and enjoy a &s;cene of momentary deception, which &s;eems to recal the golden age of Saturn.&mdash;The young couples retired, loudly and unanimou&s;ly declaring&mdash;</P>
<P>"Our Queen is an excellent woman; &s;he &s;oft|ens the grandeur of the crown!"</P>
<P>None of her perfections e&s;caped the watchful eye of Theodoric. He ro&s;e each morning with an ardent wi&s;h for evening, which was again to bring him to her arms. None of her charms e&s;caped the jealous eye of Harold. He threw him&s;elf each evening on his couch more out of humour, and greeted each morning with a fre&s;h cur&s;e. Whe|ther Harold &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ufficient power to &s;ub|due this increa&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion, let Meiners, the philo|&s;opher, decide, who probably on &s;ome cold win|ter's day, &s;at at his de&s;k in a room without a fire, and while, with the apathy of a &s;toic, he proved to us "that it was in every one's power to fall in love or not,"<NOTE N="2"> For the attempt to explain this ab&s;urd doctrine, &s;ee Mei|ner's fanta&s;tic publication, entitled, "Vermi&s;chte Philo&s;ophi&s;che Schriften."</NOTE> forgot that the image of unhappy con&s;equences, which, according to his doctrine, we ought to paint to our&s;elves, never is &s;o &s;trong and lively in our &s;ouls as the pro&s;pect of bli&s;s, which we hope to enjoy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the be|loved object.</P>
<P>Harold did not &s;ubdue his pa&s;&s;ion, nor did he
<PB N="7" REF="037753_0107_100F27178737A418">
wi&s;h to &s;ubdue it. It was no longer love alone that tortured him, but lu&s;t, ambition, envy, and vexation. He cur&s;ed Chance and Fate (two words which with him had but one meaning) for having ca&s;t him &s;o near the throne, and yet robbed him of the power to mount it.</P>
<P>"Was I a&s;ked," &s;aid he, "when I came into the world, what character I would a&s;&s;ume? am I to blame becau&s;e my mother was not a pea&s;ant's daughter? This burning thir&s;t for &s;ame would then have been confined to the &s;uperior cultivation of my little farm; more numerous herds, more productive land, more fruitful trees than tho&s;e of my neighbours, would have been the height of Ha|rold's wi&s;hes. Some good hone&s;t wench had &s;hared my hard bed, and labour would have choked the &s;eeds of ambition, &s;own by Nature in my re&s;tle&s;s &s;oul. What am I now? A mi&s;erable medium between dignity and meanne&s;s, a fort of chief &s;lave to the throne, a hanger-on to increa&s;e the &s;plendour of the Court; a mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant to receive the gue&s;ts, and drink their healths. By Heaven, I will no longer play this &s;orry part! Thus, or thus &s;hall it be! Flows not in my veins the &s;ame princely blood to which Theodoric is obliged for empire? Were not my ance&s;tors Kings? Is it my fault, that
<PB N="8" REF="037753_0108_100F27190DF808D8">
one of them was &s;uch a fool as to make a voluntary re&s;ignation of his crown, that he might retire to &s;olitude, as he &s;aid, to &s;erve the Gods, or, as his cotemporaries &s;ay, to lament his folly? Could he, by this renunciation, defraud his po&s;terity of their rights? No truly. Every throne is built upon the right of the &s;tronger, though we pretend to fancy that we hold it by the grace of God. Give me a well-trained army, and a teeming trea&s;ury&mdash;I'll prove my right to the dominion of half the globe."</P>
<P>The&s;e principles &s;oon gave birth to a &s;cheme, which could only &s;prout and ripen in a &s;oul &s;o ba&s;e. The crafty villain knew full well that a feeling heart may know want even amid&s;t piles of wealth, and in the bittere&s;t poverty never can be truly wretched: hence the infernal project, founded on Theodoric's fickle di&s;po&s;ition, to rob him of his peace of mind, together with his throne.</P>
<P>Meanwhile a year pa&s;&s;ed away in bli&s;sful uni|formity. The eyes of Harold often &s;poke with a wild tenderne&s;s; Theodoric perceived it not, and Ildegerte &s;eemed not to perceive it. She would not mortify the man who was her hu&s;band's friend; &s;he would not, by di&s;dain, make him doubly feel the hard&s;hip of his lot. And woe be to you, Oh women! who di&s;mi&s;s the man with contempt,
<PB N="9" REF="037753_0109_100F271AC5EC01A8">
that, without intending it, has &s;wallowed poi&s;on from your charms. You have a thou&s;and other means, within the bounds which you your&s;elves have cho&s;en, to keep him at a re&s;pectful di&s;tance; you have a thou&s;and antidotes to cure him of his folly: but &s;corn and contempt betray a childi&s;h pride, and an unpoli&s;hed mind.</P>
<P>Ildegerte always acted with the mildne&s;s of the dove, and cunning of the &s;erpent. She received the Prince at all times with a friendly cheerful air, and never courted or avoided an opportunity of being left alone with him. Whenever, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, the conver&s;ation a&s;&s;umed by di&s;tant hints a dubious meaning, &s;he under&s;tood &s;o well how to bend to the direct road, that &s;he often, without confu&s;ion, checked the avowal, which already floated on the Prince's lips. When he gazed at her with &s;ilent tenderne&s;s, &s;he never ca&s;t her eyes upon the earth, but looked directly in his face with the mien of virtuous &s;implicity, which ex|pects nothing criminal.</P>
<P>Harold was forced to confe&s;s that &s;he was not thus to be obtained, and that the look of artle&s;s innocence bound the &s;educer's tongue with heavier chains, than the o&s;tentatious virtue, which will have its merits acknowledged and re&s;pected.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="037753_0110_100F271D761B93E8">
The ro&s;es now bloomed a &s;econd time, &s;ince the happie&s;t couple in the North had a&s;cended the throne, when Ildegerte bore a &s;on, the image of his mother. His fir&s;t infantile &s;miles were a new and more powerful tie, the &s;tronge&s;t which Nature has woven to bind tender hearts together. With a tear of joy, Theodoric received the dear pledge of love from the nur&s;e's hand. With the mo&s;t af|fectionate &s;olicitude, he &s;at throughout the fir&s;t nights at Ildegerte's bed, angry at every fly that dared to interrupt her &s;lumbers. Town and coun|try &s;hared the father's happine&s;s, and hailed, with fe&s;tive joy, the birth of the young prince. Harold alone &s;aw in this boy the robber of a diadem, which, as he thought, was formed to grace his brow; and on the day that a whole nation formed the plea&s;ing hope of &s;eeing the virtues of his fa|ther and mother flouri&s;h in young Haldan, (thus the Prince was called) he alone locked him&s;elf with|in his palace, under pretence of indi&s;po&s;ition, which hindered his appearance at Court; for he was wi&s;e enough to know, how great would be the contra&s;t between his woeful vi&s;age, and the ge|neral happine&s;s, as well as how dangerous to his &s;chemes might be &s;ome courtier's eye, which had penetration enough to fathom the bottom of his
<PB N="11" REF="037753_0111_100F271FAC476B30">
heart. But while Court, town, and country pa&s;|&s;ed &s;everal weeks in glad fe&s;tivity, he did not &s;pend his time in idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>At Canfried's death, the crown of Sweden de|volved to Hermanfried, his brother, an impetuous youth, who&s;e temper was ea&s;ily rou&s;ed, and who was only re&s;trained from many an act of folly by his gentle &s;i&s;ter Luitgardis, yet &s;carce &s;eventeen years of age. Long had he ob&s;erved with jealous eye the increa&s;ing power of Denmark; but the de|feat of his brother, with whom fell the flower of Sweden's warriors, had reduced his kingdom to a &s;tate of impotence, and for the pre&s;ent bound his hands. Harold became acquainted, through his &s;pies, with this young monarch's views, and failed not as a malecontent to furni&s;h him with projects, which were eagerly caught at. He offered him his &s;ervices and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, repre&s;ented Denmark as an ea&s;y conque&s;t, and propo&s;ed to accept the con|quered crown as a foedary to Sweden. He was lucky enough to per&s;uade Hermanfried, who now made preparations for attack, while Theodoric carele&s;sly repo&s;ed in the lap of peace.</P>
<P>But you would deceive your&s;elf, good reader, if you imagined that the villain's propo&s;als to Her|manfried were his real purpo&s;e; he only wi&s;hed
<PB N="12" REF="037753_0112_100F2721D001AFD0">
to plunge his country into a difficulty, from which it could not be extricated but by a mighty blow, and this blow was to hit Theodoric's heart.</P>
<P>All being &s;ettled to his wi&s;h, he, one morning, with downca&s;t look and clouded forehead, entered the King's chamber.</P>
<P>"I bring you bad news," commenced he.</P>
<P>"Well, thanks to Fate for it," an&s;wered the King. "He who is too happy, ea&s;ily becomes pre&s;umptuous. Let me hear it."</P>
<P>"Hermanfried, King of Sweden," rejoined he, "is arming again&s;t you."</P>
<P>"Is that all?" &s;aid Theodoric.</P>
<P>"All!" replied the Prince, "and enough as I think."</P>
<P>"I thought," proceeded the King," the Swedes were &s;till &s;ufficiently employed in healing the wounds inflicted by my &s;word, when Canfried reigned. At all events their rage is but the mad|ne&s;s of a &s;carce recovered foe, who dares to cope with his &s;ound antagoni&s;t."</P>
<P>"Even were it &s;o," returned Harold, "poli|cy forbids us to de&s;pi&s;e a weaker foe. But my in|formation is far different. Hermanfried, (as the &s;pies whom I &s;ent out inform me), cannot brook
<PB N="13" REF="037753_0113_100F2723DA9F8958">
the di&s;grace &s;u&s;tained by Sweden in his brother's reign. He is re&s;olved to wa&s;h it away with blood, and con&s;cious of his own inability, has bound to his intere&s;t the princes of Tartary, Novagorod, Tiver, A&s;tracan, and Ca&s;an, part of whom have joined him as zealous allies, and the re&s;t lent him their armies for a large &s;um. It is likewi&s;e agreed among them, that the confederate troops &s;hall be allowed to plunder, murder, rob, and ravi&s;h through the vanqui&s;hed realms, that all the booty as well as your royal trea&s;ure &s;hall be &s;hared among the Tartarian princes, and your &s;ubjects be doomed to wear their chains, Ildegerte alone excepted, whom Hermanfried, to avenge his brother's death, intends to be devoured, in &s;ight of his &s;ubjects, by wild bea&s;ts."</P>
<P>"Arrogant wretch!" cried Theodoric; "he may force the way to her through my brea&s;t."</P>
<P>"And will too," an&s;wered the Prince. "I confe&s;s that Harold trembles for the &s;afety of your throne."</P>
<P>"Ha&s;te then!" exclaimed the King. "Col|lect my whole force on the borders of Sweden; I my&s;elf will lead them to battle."</P>
<P>"Collect your whole force!" repeated Harold, &s;hrugging his &s;houlders; "it amounts not to the
<PB N="14" REF="037753_0114_100F27260B4E7090">
tenth part of the armies combined again&s;t you. A conqueror, (as you well know) earns not his laurels without lo&s;s. The defeat of Canfried co&s;t us many a hero's life. Many a hardy veteran was &s;ent to Valhall, and men do not grow like mu&s;h|rooms."</P>
<P>"Give me your coun&s;el then," rejoined Theo|doric; "&s;hall I avert the evil by my trea&s;ures?"</P>
<P>"A mode unworthy of you," &s;aid the Prince; "be&s;ides, (as may, without the gift of prophecy, be ea&s;ily fore&s;een) of the wor&s;t con&s;equences. It would betray our weakne&s;s, and Hermanfried will be revenged. His rage is not to be appea&s;ed by gold. I have already told you, he re&s;igns the booty to the Tartars."</P>
<P>"Let us then &s;eek allies," returned Theodoric.</P>
<P>"Where? whom?" demanded Harold.</P>
<P>"Among the German Princes," an&s;wered he.</P>
<P>"Oh! they live in eternal di&s;cord with each other," replied Harold. "There every petty Ba|ron is an ab&s;olute Prince, who, from the turrets of his ca&s;tle bids defiance to the boors, and nou|ri&s;hes his wife and family by pillage and road-rob|beries."</P>
<P>"Well then, among the Britons," &s;aid Theo|doric.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="037753_0115_100F2728B0166108">
"Yes," rejoined the Prince, "if the danger did not already beat at your door. The Britons are at too great a di&s;tance, and what intere&s;t could they have in venturing their troops acro&s;s the ocean, to a&s;&s;i&s;t a foreign nation, with whom they never were allied?"</P>
<P>"Speak then!" cried the King, in a tone of di&s;tre&s;s, "What mu&s;t I do? Sacrifice all to the fury of the foe without defence?"</P>
<P>Harold pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Oh! why," proceeded he at length, "did Fate combine &s;o many amiable qualities in Ildegerte, and refu&s;e her the title of a king's daughter?"</P>
<P>"Kin&s;man," returned Theodoric, "your ideas make &s;trange &s;prings."</P>
<P>"Not at all," an&s;wered he; "they unite very naturally. Were Ildegerte the daughter of &s;i&s;ter of a mighty Prince we &s;hould not be &s;tanding here, and puzzling where to look for an alliance."</P>
<P>"True!" &s;aid the King, &s;truck with the truth of the ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>"And had not my kinder cou&s;in &s;corned the coun&s;el of &s;tate policy," continued Harold, "he might now, by a tender tie, have founded the wel|fare of his &s;ubjects; he might, by a &s;ingle word,
<PB N="16" REF="037753_0116_100F272A36E68508">
have cau&s;ed the uplifted hand to &s;ink, and &s;ent the threatening falchion to its &s;cabbard.</P>
<P>"And what may this word be?" a&s;ked he.</P>
<P>"I know from certain information," rejoined Harold, "that Hermanfried would not object, by a marriage between his &s;i&s;ter and the King of Den|mark, to unite the Northern realms in friendly compact."</P>
<P>"His &s;i&s;ter!" repeated Theodoric, &s;omewhat confu&s;ed; "I &s;carce knew he had a &s;i&s;ter."</P>
<P>"A lovely girl," returned the villain, "who has &s;carce &s;een &s;eventeen &s;ummers: Luitgardis is her name."</P>
<P>"Indeed!" an&s;wered the King. "And you can think that Canfried's brother (who, as you &s;ay, breathes nought but vengeance) would be willing to throw a girl, &s;uch as you de&s;cribe Luitgardis to be, into the arms of his enemy?"</P>
<P>"I believe he would," an&s;wered Harold. "There is a certain anecdote in circulation at the Swedi&s;h Court. Your picture (Heaven knows how) fell into the hands of the Prince&s;s; and, &s;ince that time, 'tis whi&s;pered the good creature of|ten &s;eems quite lo&s;t in contemplation, courts &s;oli|tude in &s;hady groves, and has po&s;itively refu&s;ed the hand of many a mighty prince. Nay, they
<PB N="17" REF="037753_0117_100F272C625F2DD8">
even pretend to have heard from one of her attend|ants, that &s;he wears the much-loved picture &s;et in diamonds near her heart, and often wets it with a tear."</P>
<P>Theodoric felt his vanity flattered.</P>
<P>"Were this true," replied he, "I &s;hould pity her."</P>
<P>"Now you will ea&s;ily perceive," continued Ha|rold, "why Hermanfried, who loves his &s;i&s;ter mo&s;t &s;incerely, and to whom the &s;ufferings of her heart can be no &s;ecret, would renounce his thoughts of vengeance to &s;ee Luitgardis happy."</P>
<P>"Yes, plain enough," rejoined Theodoric, confu&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Indeed," proceeded the Prince, "I have been privately given to under&s;tand&mdash;but I rejected it."</P>
<P>"Speak! what?" demanded the King.</P>
<P>"That you might, in order to &s;pare the effu&s;ion of blood, and the de&s;olation of your kingdoms, marry Luitgardis."</P>
<P>"Ab&s;urd idea!" exclaimed he. "How is it po&s;&s;ible? Is not Ildegerte&mdash;?"</P>
<P>"True. That was my an&s;wer," &s;aid the crafty villain. "But they pretended that the welfare of
<PB N="18" REF="037753_0118_100F272F130A5BF0">
your &s;tate might induce you to &s;acrifice an indivi|dual for the public good."</P>
<P>"Never!" cried he.</P>
<P>"So I told them," replied Harold, "but they thought that you might &s;weeten the &s;eparation in a thou&s;and ways; that you might &s;end her to her native country, e&s;tabli&s;h a Court for her under the title of Queen, and&mdash;but how can I recollect all the non&s;en&s;e they fabricated to make the &s;cheme practicable?"</P>
<P>"No!" exclaimed Theodoric. "Rather will I die in mi&s;ery, I and my people."</P>
<P>Harold, who now thought he had for this time done enough, as he plainly &s;aw that the fir&s;t &s;park, which he had carele&s;sly thrown, had already &s;eized the cinders, that the gloomy frown of di&s;content and perplexity lowered upon Theodoric's brow, left to time the ta&s;k of blowing it into a blaze, and fini&s;hed the di&s;cour&s;e by once more maliciou&s;ly de&s;cribing the mi&s;ery which inevitably threatened him, if he did not &s;eize the only thread that could guide him out of the labyrinth.</P>
<P>"True it is," &s;aid he, &s;hrugging his &s;houlders, "it requires but a couple of eyes, (even if they cannot penetrate &s;o very far into futurity) to per|ceive the i&s;&s;ue of this bloody conte&s;t. You mu&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="037753_0119_100F273149DFD500">
de&s;cend from the throne of your forefathers, fly over the bodies of your &s;ubjects, and with difficulty &s;ave your life. But Ildegerte and your faithful Harold will every where accompany you. By the labour of our hands we will fertilize &s;ome de&s;ert, and earn our daily mor&s;el by the &s;weat of the brow. And, when the &s;pirits of the murdered Danes pour forth their cur&s;es upon thee, when their blood cries for vengeance at the throne of Odin, Oh! may the infant Haldan's artle&s;s &s;upplication bend the hearts of the Gods to thee again!"</P>
<P>With the&s;e words he left the weak Theodoric, in a perturbation which drove him to and fro like the crazy &s;kiff upon the &s;tormy main. Even the wreck of a world could not have moved him to an act of treachery, had the warmth of his affec|tion been the &s;ame as that which had in&s;pired him on the field of battle; but it mu&s;t be owned that unmole&s;ted enjoyment had damped his ardour. A calm e&s;teem, (if not altogether devoid of tender|ne&s;s, yet con&s;cious of an undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion) was alone remaining in his brea&s;t. He already allowed him&s;elf many a little infidelity; he was able again to make compari&s;ons between the charms of Ildegerte and of others: to be &s;ure he &s;till always found the former far &s;uperior, but thought
<PB N="20" REF="037753_0120_100F2732D1E23770">
the latter worth enjoyment. In &s;hort, he was a weak young man, without command over any of his pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;till le&s;s &s;o, when the crafty Ha|rold always knew how to encourage and to &s;atisfy them! Who but mu&s;t have ob&s;erved how dexter|ou&s;ly he attacked Theodoric's vanity? This mine was not the mo&s;t ineffectual of all that he had &s;prung. The gentle Luitgardis had never thought of falling in love with a picture. She was care|le&s;sly roving from one youthful plea&s;ure to ano|ther, at the very moment that Theodoric fancied her wan, wretched, and &s;inking under the &s;orrows of an unhappy attachment.</P>
<P>A few days elap&s;ed. The report of an approach|ing war &s;pread far and wide. The danger was magnified by Harold's in&s;tigation, and the fate of the kingdom repre&s;ented as hanging by a thread. Wherever the King turned his eye, it caught &s;ome gloomy ill-foreboding look. The people groaned and wept. The rich buried their trea|&s;ures; the prie&s;ts offered &s;acrifice, and poured forth prayers both day and night.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e agonizing circum&s;tances, while Theodoric, with downca&s;t head, was one morning meditating on his &s;ituation, his &s;enators were announced. Bribed by the favourite in part
<PB N="21" REF="037753_0121_100F2734EACCA658">
with words, in part with gold, they threw them|&s;elves at the feet of the King, and in the name of his mi&s;erable &s;ubjects, claimed from him the deli|verance of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>"What mu&s;t, what can I do?" &s;aid he. "To convert &s;tones into men is not in my power."</P>
<P>"Then you may at lea&s;t pre&s;erve tho&s;e," re|plied the chief &s;enator, "who are now alive, who till the earth, and are the kingdom's chief &s;upport."</P>
<P>"What do ye want of me?" demanded The|odoric. "Is it I who wi&s;h to violate the peace?"</P>
<P>"No," an&s;wered the &s;enator, "but you are he, who will not, by a trifling &s;acrifice, &s;ecure it."</P>
<P>"What &s;acrifice?" a&s;ked he. "Name it."</P>
<P>"You know full well," rejoined the &s;enator, "what price Hermanfried has &s;et upon his friend|&s;hip. He has fixed it as a dowry for his &s;i&s;ter."</P>
<P>"And call'&s;t thou this a trifling &s;acrifice?" re|turned Theodoric.</P>
<P>"Trifling it is," &s;aid he, "great as it may &s;eem to you; trifling when compared with that far greater evil, which you will thereby avert. We &s;tand here in the name of the people. We addre&s;s you not as father and as hu&s;band! 'Tis the King to whom we fly for &s;uccour. The pea&s;ant prays for &s;un&s;hine to unclo&s;e the ears of corn,
<PB N="22" REF="037753_0122_100F27372BB1A758">
even though here and there a blo&s;&s;om may be withered by the &s;corching beam."</P>
<P>"How!" cried he. "Could you vote for that noble being's bani&s;hment, to whom you ought to be grateful for an increa&s;e of your dignity?"</P>
<P>"'Tis this very gratitude," returned the &s;enator, "which makes us cheri&s;h the fond hope that &s;he will not de&s;troy her own good work. If the wel|fare of whole nations was the real motive of her glorious deeds, (and who among us dares to doubt it?) then may we certainly expect from Il|degerte's elevated mind, that &s;he will comply with the wi&s;hes of the people, &s;eeking her reward in the ble&s;&s;ings of a re&s;cued nation, and truly &s;eeking not in vain."</P>
<P>What could be urged again&s;t all this? Theodo|ric, who already thought a &s;eparation from Ilde|gerte po&s;&s;ible, who could reconcile this action to his fickle heart, by the &s;pecious apology that he was but fulfilling the duties of a good king, and a father of his &s;ubjects; who had no fear of pub|lic cen&s;ure, &s;ince the nation had it&s;elf required this &s;acrifice; who could only dread the voice of con&s;cience, which he lulled at plea&s;ure, and the voice of &s;uffering innocence, which, far removed, might echo through the woods of Norway, but
<PB N="23" REF="037753_0123_100F2739417E1C50">
never reach his ear.&mdash;What could you expect from &s;uch a man? Strange it is that it &s;hould &s;eem to co&s;t him any pain, &s;trange that he did not im|mediately con&s;ent to all.</P>
<P>"Go, a&s;k the oracle. Its declaration &s;hall be my deci&s;ion."</P>
<P>With the&s;e words he left his &s;enators, who, &s;ure of conque&s;t, ha&s;tened to the neighbouring temple, but too certain that the my&s;terious cloak, which ever &s;hrouded the meaning of the oracle, would allow them to explain it as they plea&s;ed. After having placed a co&s;tly pre&s;ent on the altar, the prie&s;t began the ceremonies. His di&s;torted coun|tenance, his bri&s;tling hair, his rolling eyes, and foaming mouth announced the pre&s;ence of the God. At length, in&s;pired by Odin, he addre&s;&s;ed them thus:</P>
<P>"Before my eyes appear two Queens. This bears in her hand a &s;word, and that a branch of palm. The &s;erpent, which Theodoric cheri&s;hes in his bo&s;om, &s;hall be cru&s;hed by Ildegerte's foot."</P>
<P>With this unintelligible jargon, the &s;enators contentedly departed.</P>
<P>"What can be more evident," &s;aid one to the other, "than that the Godhead &s;anctions our in|tentions? Two Queens! How can there be two,
<PB N="24" REF="037753_0124_100F273B5AE8AC00">
if Luitgardis be not under&s;tood as one? She who bears the &s;word is Ildegerte, becau&s;e &s;he gave occa|&s;ion to the &s;trife. She who bears the branch of palm is the Swedi&s;h Prince&s;s, becau&s;e &s;he brings us golden peace."</P>
<P>The &s;erpent in the King's bo&s;om was the mo&s;t knotty point to be explained, but even this they contrived to effect.</P>
<P>"The &s;erpent," &s;aid they, "&s;ignifies the &s;tub|born oppo&s;ition of Theodoric to the wi&s;hes of his people; and if Ildegerte willingly &s;ubmit to her fate, certainly &s;he may be &s;aid to cru&s;h the &s;erpent. Never &s;urely was there a decree le&s;s capable of mi&s;|interpretation. 'Tis clear to the meane&s;t capacity. A child may di&s;cover the &s;en&s;e &s;o plainly conveyed."</P>
<P>Thus they cheerfully returned to the palace, and announced the fixed re&s;olves of Fate; to which the King had given his &s;olemn promi&s;e that he would &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>"Who can oppo&s;e the Gods?" &s;aid he, after a pau&s;e. "I am re&s;olved. I give my people peace, perhaps to be in everla&s;ting war with my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Harold wi&s;hed no more. Before the wavering King had lei&s;ure to recant, amba&s;&s;adors were with the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy di&s;patched to Sweden, to &s;ue for the hand of Luitgardis. They returned in a
<PB N="25" REF="037753_0125_100F273D7B891E90">
a few weeks with the wi&s;hed-for an&s;wer, that, on this condition, Hermanfried was willing to con|clude an agreement of eternal peace. Now the fir&s;t &s;tep was taken. To retreat would be &s;till more to exa&s;perate a formidable foe. Nothing therefore remained but to &s;wim with the current. A &s;econd emba&s;&s;y &s;oon followed, ve&s;ted with full powers to &s;ettle the preliminaries of dowry and of jointure.</P>
<P>Who does not at once perceive the road which Harold was paving for him&s;elf by all the&s;e machi|nations? Ildegerte, incen&s;ed to the utmo&s;t by treat|ment which, her proud heart will every moment whi&s;per to her, &s;he &s;o little merits; Ildegerte, rob|bed of her hu&s;band, together with a throne, will thir&s;t for vengeance, will &s;eek an in&s;trument to execute it, and in the Prince will find what her galled ambition and her &s;lighted love require. To wound this ambition and love beyond all power of cure, &s;he mu&s;t be witne&s;s of her rival's triumph. For this purpo&s;e, he per&s;uaded the king, (who, &s;ince the irrevocable acquie&s;cence, had been whirl|ed in a vortex of perpetual agony, and was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to do any thing) not to remove Ildegerte from the Court till Luitgardis was approaching the gates of his metropolis.</P>
<P>"For," &s;aid he, "how ea&s;ily may any unfore|&s;een
<PB N="26" REF="037753_0126_100F27409759FB48">
event&mdash;a &s;torm for in&s;tance, or a &s;udden ill|ne&s;s, rob you of your bride; then would you la|ment the lo&s;s of one, without finding comfort and con&s;olation in the other."</P>
<P>To all this Theodoric con&s;ented. Unplea&s;ant things we are ever willing to defer, and &s;till was the thought of lo&s;ing Ildegerte painful to his heart. The arrival of the Prince&s;s too (if this parting were deferred till then), might di&s;&s;ipate his &s;orrows, which he never could expect to be the ca&s;e, while left in &s;olitude to the agonies of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>All therefore ripened according to Harold's wi&s;h, and he re&s;igned him&s;elf entirely to the flattering hope of &s;hortly reaping the harve&s;t of his labours.</P>
<P>As yet Ildegerte had not learnt a &s;yllable of the dark de&s;igns which an infernal villain was meditat|ing again&s;t her peace. She re&s;igned her&s;elf entirely to the charming novelty of a mother's joys, and &s;pent her time chiefly in playing with little Haldan as he &s;at upon her lap, fea&s;ting her eye and ear with the &s;mile and li&s;p of infancy. The King was cautious not to interrupt her plea&s;ing dream of happine&s;s, and Harold had taken care to &s;urround her by his creatures, that &s;he might have no &s;u&s;pi|cion till a proper time. But now that he received intelligence of Luitgardis's approach, he thought
<PB N="27" REF="037753_0127_100F2742A481DB10">
it right at once to unveil the infamous de&s;ign. He vi&s;ited Ildegerte, and contrived to mingle &s;o much of the my&s;terious in his words and looks, to imitate &s;o well the mien of confu&s;ion which in vain attempts concealment, that, at la&s;t, the Queen could not forbear to a&s;k&mdash;</P>
<P>"Why &s;o re&s;erved to-day, Prince? Whence the cloud which hangs upon your brow?"</P>
<P>"Venture not, Oh Queen! to break that cloud!" replied he &s;ignificantly: "A fla&s;h might dart from it which would annihilate you."</P>
<P>"Would you try," &s;aid Ildegerte &s;miling, "whe|ther I am but a woman to be frightened by mere words?"</P>
<P>"Words!" repeated he. "Yes, words, of which one would drive this &s;mile of &s;weet content for ever from your countenance."</P>
<P>"Then let me hear this one terrific word," an|&s;wered &s;he. "You know that he who is ac|quainted with the full extent of his misfortunes, is far le&s;s to be pitied than he who &s;tands in doubt upon the brink of an aby&s;s, the near approach to which he has been left to gue&s;s."</P>
<P>Here Harold &s;eemed as if he tried in vain to &s;peak.</P>
<P>"No&mdash;impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;not from my lips&mdash;pardon
<PB N="28" REF="037753_0128_100F27442CFC3088">
&mdash;I have no utterance for black ingratitude and perfidy."</P>
<P>"You make me unea&s;y, Prince," rejoined Il|degerte. "What &s;troke of Fate can reach me in the arms of love? The King too has for &s;everal weeks &s;eemed troubled and confu&s;ed. Tell me what misfortune&mdash;Has Ildegerte unknowingly of|fended him?"</P>
<P>"How could Ildegerte!" exclaimed he, "the crown of womankind, afford melancholy a pretext to lower upon Theodoric's forehead? No. You have not offended him, yet will he doom the be&s;t of wives to mi&s;ery unutterable."</P>
<P>"Me!" cried Ildegerte. "Impo&s;&s;ible!"</P>
<P>"But too true," returned Harold.&mdash;"Alas! Beauty, merit, and virtue mu&s;t bind every heart in chains, but even beauty, merit, and virtue can|not hold the fickle libertine in &s;ilken bonds for ever. Inexpre&s;&s;ible are the &s;ervices you have ren|dered to the &s;tate. Your amiable qualities are the admiration of a whole nation, and exalt you far above the crown you wear. Why was the fir&s;t of mortals made a prey to the wanton levity of a voluptuous traitor?"</P>
<P>"Hold, Prince," interrupted &s;he.&mdash;"You go too far. Ju&s;tify your words."</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="037753_0129_100F2745B7FD86D0">
"You de&s;ire it," an&s;wered he, "and I obey. Hear then, and comprehend (if with your good heart you can) a villany mo&s;t diabolical. You were a Queen: forget that! I know you. Still will you remain a Queen, if not upon the throne, yet in the hearts of all who love you. You were a wife: forget that too! 'Twas all a dream. Awake. You are a mother: never forget that! What has the guiltle&s;s &s;uckling done, that he &s;hould be robbed of his rightful inheritance by his fa|ther's infamy? Who will protect him, if his mo|ther too for&s;ake him?"</P>
<P>"Now by the golden &s;hields of Odin,"<NOTE N="3">Golden &s;hields of Odin and A&s;gard. See note 22.</NOTE> ex|claimed Ildegerte, "never was oracle delivered in the groves of A&s;gard<NOTE N="4"> Golden &s;hields of Odin and A&s;gard. See note 22.</NOTE> more ob&s;cure. I was a Queen! I was a wife! When did I cea&s;e to be &s;o?"</P>
<P>"Since Theodoric," replied the Prince, "glut|ted with bli&s;s, infernally re&s;olved to ca&s;t you from his throne and bed. Since he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Hermanfried, to conclude an everla&s;ting union, and the knot which forms this union is Luitgardis, &s;i&s;ter of the King. Know you enough?

<P>Ildegerte&mdash;</P>
<P>But why need I de&s;cribe the broken accents of anger, a&s;toni&s;hment, and indignation, the heavy &s;ighs of horror, di&s;carded tenderne&s;s, and mortifi|ed affection? At the fir&s;t moment, while her mind was unacquainted with a perfidy to which &s;he nei|ther could nor would give credit; at the fir&s;t mo|ment &s;uch an action &s;eemed to her as mon&s;trous as to the poli&s;hed European the account of people, who in cool blood rai&s;e their clubs to &s;end their aged parents to the grave. She believed not the Prince's words; but Harold &s;wore &s;o &s;olemnly, ad|ded &s;o many corroborations, now pointing out to her the increa&s;ing coldne&s;s of Theodoric, now the preparations at Court, which betrayed the approach of &s;ome great fe&s;tival, (and which indeed had not e&s;caped her eye, though they had too little occu|pied her exalted mind to force from her an inqui|&s;itive que&s;tion) connecting proof to proof &s;o art|fully, and making her imperceptibly extract &s;u&s;pi|cion from her hu&s;band's every look, that he at length planted in her &s;oul the dreadful certainty of her impending fate. The unhappy being riveted

her eyes upon the earth, unable to &s;hed a &s;ingle tear, or form a re&s;olution, and &s;carcely retaining her &s;en&s;es. This was the &s;ituation which Harold had awaited; upon this fir&s;t &s;tupor he had formed his plan.</P>
<P>"You perceive, Oh Queen!" proceeded the hypocrite, "that I am hazarding my life by di&s;clo&s;|ing to you a &s;ecret at which the King him&s;elf trembles. But long have you known how little I regard my happine&s;s and life, if Fate will but al|low me to re&s;ign them in your &s;ervice. Difficult it is to counteract Theodoric's infidelity, but not impo&s;&s;ible. Rou&s;e your courage; I have many friends, and your Amazons are ready at the fir&s;t &s;ignal to a&s;&s;i&s;t and to avenge you. Summon them to arms; gra&s;p again the &s;word which already has atchieved &s;uch wondrous deeds; pre&s;s on your head the helm of valiant Swend, (alas! he would not thus have treated you!) redeem a crown for little Haldan, which by primogeniture is his; drive the villain, together with the creature for who&s;e &s;ake he bani&s;hes an Ildegerte, drive them into de&s;erved mi&s;ery, and mount the throne. My arm, and a thou&s;and arms, at my command, are prepared to draw their &s;abres in your cau&s;e. My voice &s;hall be the &s;ignal for revolt. Beneath your
<PB N="32" REF="037753_0132_100F27EA6DF64410">
banners &s;hall Harold perform miracles, and at your &s;ide will he mount the throne, or die."</P>
<P>"No, Prince," replied &s;he. "Far be from me &s;uch conduct. True it is, you &s;ee my tears, nor am I able to re&s;train them; but think not that they flow for the ideal lo&s;s of a crown, which, in the intoxication of his tran&s;ports, Theodoric once forced me to accept: they flow for the lo&s;s of a heart which was far dearer to me than the pomp of re|gal dignity; and if by arms I could recover this, what &s;hould I thereby gain in his heart? No. I have no arms again&s;t Theodoric but my tears."</P>
<P>"Virtue over&s;trained," &s;aid Harold, "dege|nerates into a fault; you forget that we are not debating on you and on your rights. If you &s;ink to|day beneath your weakne&s;s, you are preparing for your&s;elf the bittere&s;t reproaches from a &s;on. His fortunes now depend on your's, and his rights they are, which (if you feel the &s;acred impul&s;e of a mother's duties) you mu&s;t defend by arms. Or, do you chu&s;e that he &s;hould beg his life hereafter at the mercy of your rival's children?"</P>
<P>"You &s;torm my heart in vain," rejoined Ilde|gerte. "If Haldan do not inherit any throne from his mother, &s;till may he feel content in virtu|ous
<PB N="33" REF="037753_0133_100F27EC813E34F0">
&s;en&s;ations, to plant which early in his bo&s;om is the mo&s;t &s;acred of a mother's duties."</P>
<P>"Your ideas," an&s;wered Harold&mdash;"pardon me, beauteous Queen&mdash;your ideas have mounted to a better world, and you appear to have for|gotten that you are &s;till an inhabitant of this our earth, on which they never can be realized. I leave you, for your pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition favours not the plan of cool, clear-&s;ighted judgment. I am convinced that the mi&s;t, which &s;eems to dim your eyes, will &s;oon di&s;per&s;e. You will not bear the thought of being a mark for the deri&s;ion of your rival. Till then, farewell," continued he, &s;eizing Ildegerte's hand, and tenderly pre&s;&s;ing it, "fare|well! and re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that Harold, who&s;e fidelity has long been known to you, will hazard his life a thou&s;and times for a &s;ingle tender look from you."</P>
<P>He went, and left Ildegerte in a &s;ituation which my pen would in vain attempt to de&s;cribe. A co|pious flood of tears relieved her aching heart; &s;he threw her&s;elf into the arms of her faithful Helga, and was again able to weep and to complain.</P>
<P>"Fate then de&s;tined two powerful Kings to be my hu&s;band, only that one might be torn from me ere I had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him, and that I might by the other be di&s;gracefully bani&s;hed, to lament in &s;ome

lone de&s;ert an attachment, the fir&s;t enjoyment of which I have &s;o dearly bought."</P>
<P>A thou&s;and projects &s;tarted in her brain. At one time &s;he re&s;olved to throw her&s;elf at Theodo|ric's feet, and &s;ue for his affection, or death by his hand. At another, &s;he determined to appear be|fore him, with the dignity of injured virtue, to rai&s;e repentance in his bo&s;om, and then to turn her back upon him with di&s;dain. But &s;he ever firmly rejected Helga's well-meant coun&s;el, who with all her rhetoric &s;upported Harold's plan.</P>
<P>"We can at lea&s;t," thought &s;he, "thereby af|fright the King, and from his fears obtain what his love denies."</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Ildegerte, "I require ju&s;tice from his heart. If it be denied at that tribunal, I will be &s;ilent till we &s;tand before the Highe&s;t Judge. Then, then will Ildegerte&mdash;pardon him!"</P>
<P>"Be &s;ilent!" repeated Helga. "What, even when the arrogant deri&s;ion of a triumphant rival rends your heart!"</P>
<P>"No, Helga," an&s;wered Ildegerte, "I will not be a witne&s;s of her triumph. She &s;hall not fea&s;t upon my agonies, nor &s;hall the King. I am re&s;olved. In my bo&s;om will I hide the dreadful &s;ecret, and at Court, where all are liars, my

countenance &s;hall likewi&s;e be a liar. With a &s;mile will I appear at table; with a &s;mile will I pre&s;ent the cup, and wi&s;h good night to him. With &s;tedfa&s;t &s;tep will I quit the &s;aloon, di&s;gui&s;e my&s;elf in the habit of a &s;lave, and fly of my own accord to Nor|way's woods, that on the day which crowns his &s;econd love, he may at lea&s;t mi&s;s the triumph of beholding Ildegerte's tears. Ha&s;te, dear Helga! Mount my &s;teed, take as much of my trea&s;ures as &s;eems needful to you; ha&s;te to the &s;ea &s;hore, and buy a ve&s;&s;el, which may be ready at my &s;ignal to bear me from the&s;e hated &s;hores back to my unpo|li&s;hed country, there to dwell with far more po|li&s;hed mortals."</P>
<P>By this re&s;olution &s;he abided, in de&s;pite of all the endeavours u&s;ed by Helga to point out an ea&s;ier remedy.</P>
<P>"You try in vain," &s;aid Ildegerte, "to deceive me thus with &s;hadows. By what other means can I &s;ave my&s;elf from the di&s;grace, and a&s;&s;ert tho&s;e &s;entiments which ever were my pride? Shall I at his feet implore his love? or am I, by a hu&s;band's infidelity, ju&s;tified in forgetting that this hu&s;band is my King? No. Let him alone bear the whole burden of a tainted con&s;cience. Far be the wi&s;h from me to &s;hare it with him! But thou, Helga,

faithful companion of my happier youth, and of my &s;hort-lived dignity, wilt thou too re&s;ign the plea&s;ures of a Court to follow into mi&s;ery a bani&s;h|ed wretch?"</P>
<P>Helga wept upon her bo&s;om, &s;wore eternal friend&s;hip and fidelity, and ha&s;tened to make in|&s;tant preparations for the &s;ecret flight. In a few days &s;he returned to the Queen with the happy tidings, that in a bay which was &s;urrounded by the wood, a ve&s;&s;el ready to &s;ail awaited her com|mand.</P>
<P>WEAK Theodoric! thou wert not born to be a villain. The mine yielded not the iron in a dag|ger's &s;hape, but hateful pa&s;&s;ions forged a dagger from it. Virtue has already left thy heart, yet is it le&s;s worthy of dete&s;tation than compa&s;&s;ion. For what &s;en&s;ations had we given thee credit, if thy heart had &s;till remained a temple of virtue, com|bined with wi&s;dom and with love!</P>
<P>Do you &s;ee the reed &s;haken by the wind? Do you &s;ee him &s;leeple&s;s, and envying the trabant,<NOTE N="5">Trabant, the name given to the yeomen of the guard in the Northern Courts.</NOTE> who, &s;upported by a quiet con&s;cience more than by his halberd, nods at the palace-gate? Round

him refre&s;hing &s;leep had rocked all nature to re|po&s;e. He alone&mdash;the King, who fears no judge (that excepted who a&s;&s;erts the rights of virtue in his brea&s;t with unrelenting rigour) he alone rambles from room to room. The &s;ilken couch alleviates not the tortures of his con&s;cience; he gazes through the open window. Before him glitters the evening &s;tar, which lighted once the flowery path of love when he conducted Ildegerte to the bridal chamber. Alas! then a tear of bli&s;s &s;tood in the eye of the tran&s;ported bridegroom, and the &s;tar of love &s;parkled therein with plea&s;ure. Now a cloud of &s;ad repentant tears hung heavily before his &s;ight; throughout his realms night was the &s;ig|nal of repo&s;e&mdash;to him alone the me&s;&s;enger of reno|vated torment. The Court, the cha&s;e, the tour|nament, no longer di&s;&s;ipated care&mdash;all, all was horror. Oh Solitude! thou &s;miling friend of Wi&s;dom, how terrific art thou to the wicked!</P>
<P>Such a night it was, that, overpowered by his feelings, Theodoric ru&s;hed from his room, to fol|low the irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e of his heart, which drew him to Ildegerte. By chance, the trabant, who guarded the chamber of the King, had &s;unk under fatigue, and did not even wake at the &s;ud|den opening of the folding doors. It is difficult,
<PB N="38" REF="037753_0138_100F27F71083BCC8">
during &s;elf-&s;uffering, to behold another's peace with plea&s;ure, and if the &s;ufferer be a King, he will generally become a tyrant.&mdash;The enraged The|odoric &s;eized the trabant, and &s;hook him violently. The wretch &s;taggered, rubbed his eyes, and by the glare of lamps, which burned in the hall of the palace, beheld, with dread a&s;toni&s;hment, the King before him.</P>
<P>"What!" cried the furious Theodoric, "dare&s;t thou then leave thy Monarch's life a prey to the fir&s;t murderer, who is bold enough to creep under cover of darkne&s;s to his bed? Out of my &s;ight! thy life is forfeited! The ri&s;ing &s;un &s;hall not be|hold thee with the living!"</P>
<P>The trembling trabant fell upon his knees, and &s;aid&mdash;</P>
<P>"Oh may the King hear me, and the man for|give me! I have a dear wife and &s;even young chil|dren; they daily call for bread, and, Sire, you know our allowance is but &s;mall. Compelled by want, I bound my&s;elf for three days' labour to &s;up|port my wife and little ones, and ploughed the earth for &s;canty wages. I returned from work la&s;t night weary, but with a &s;ack of bread; I &s;atisfied my children, and expected to have &s;lept in my wife's arms. But the lot, Oh King! fell upon
<PB N="39" REF="037753_0139_100F27F92ED067D0">
me to guard your royal chamber. I was obliged to come, and having been at labour for three days, and known but little re&s;t, &s;leep overpowered me. I have forfeited my life, but throw my&s;elf upon your clemency, not for the &s;ake of this &s;car earned in your &s;ervice; but Oh! have mercy on my wife! have mercy on my helple&s;s children!"</P>
<P>"Thou happy man!" muttered the re&s;tle&s;s King between his teeth, "how willingly would I &s;ay to thee, let us exchange &s;ituations. Come, throw thy&s;elf upon my &s;ilken couch; give me thy hal|berd, and in thy &s;tead let me lean again&s;t the wall, &s;inking to re&s;t with the &s;weet conviction of having done my duty.&mdash;Ri&s;e!" proceeded he aloud, "I pardon thee! Go to thy wife, I have no need of thee&mdash;I am the guardian of you all. Go home, and teach thy children to pray for their King."</P>
<P>He &s;poke, and wandered to the Queen's apart|ment with uncertain &s;teps, tapped gently at the door, opened it with trembling hand, entered with tottering knees, and eyes which &s;hunned the light. It was the very night that Ildegerte, for ever to e&s;cape the unmerited di&s;grace, had determined to for&s;ake the palace. She was reclining on a couch, with her face turned towards the window, waiting for the ri&s;ing moon, in order, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
<PB N="40" REF="037753_0140_100F27FC0A1B20B0">
her light, to find the neighbouring bay, in which was concealed the &s;hip that was to bear her from the coa&s;t of Denmark. At her feet &s;at the faithful Helga; both were &s;ilent, both lo&s;t in a labyrinth of &s;orrowful reflections. Hark! Something was heard without the door! Now it cea&s;ed again&mdash;now it &s;eemed to be retreating&mdash;now it returned, and the door was gently opened.</P>
<P>"The King!" cried Helga, &s;tarting as &s;he re|cognized his features.</P>
<P>Fortunately a dim lamp ca&s;t but faint rays upon the couch, and &s;pread a kind of twilight over Ilde|gerte's glowing cheeks.&mdash;Theodoric too dared not to look at her, but riveting his eye upon the ground, ob&s;erved not her confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"My hu&s;band!" commenced &s;he, with a fear|ful dread that he had been apprized of her inten|tion. "Whence &s;o late at night?"</P>
<P>"Pardon me, my love," &s;aid he, "a frightful dream has forced me from my bed. Methought as you were laying in my arms, you were torn from me; I wi&s;hed to re&s;cue you&mdash;I wi&s;hed to ri&s;e, and ha&s;ten after you, but could not. I felt my arms confined by infrangible chains&mdash;I heard your la|mentations and reproaches. I raged&mdash;I foamed, and yet the more I rou&s;ed my &s;trength to bur&s;t my
<PB N="41" REF="037753_0141_100F27FE28A4D4B8">
fetters, the more, alas! was I confined by &s;ome invi&s;ible power. I at la&s;t awoke: cold drops trickled from my forehead; I &s;prung from my bed and ha&s;|tened hither!"</P>
<P>"'T was but a dream," replied Ildegerte, "and &s;uper&s;tition only &s;eeks reality in &s;hadows. How could you be thus alarmed? What can tear me from your arms as long as I am not torn from your heart?"</P>
<P>Theodoric only an&s;wered with a &s;igh. He crept &s;o affectionately into her arms, ki&s;&s;ed her &s;o ten|derly, and talked to her &s;o fervently, that Ildegerte, who thought it all hypocri&s;y and diabolical deceit, felt bitter &s;orrow in her heart. It was painful to &s;ee her&s;elf mocked (as &s;he fancied) by the villain, whom with a &s;ingle word &s;he could unma&s;k. She was &s;ilent, but unable to return the care&s;&s;es be&s;tow|ed upon her by the traitor as he hung upon her neck. The ri&s;ing moon reminded her of the in|tended flight. Ildegerte withdrew her&s;elf from the arms of her faithle&s;s hu&s;band, feigned wearine&s;s, and begged repo&s;e. He went.&mdash;</P>
<P>Alas! then awoke in her recollection, as if by an electric &s;hock, all the pa&s;t joys of love. Be|fore her eyes &s;tood the pro&s;pect of a drear futurity.</P>
<P>"Perhaps for the la&s;t time," thus whi&s;pered
<PB N="42" REF="037753_0142_100F27FFB0F86080">
her heart to her, "perhaps for the la&s;t time thou &s;ee&s;t the dear betrayer, the father of thy child."</P>
<P>She pur&s;ued him, threw her &s;now-white arms around him, and &s;tammered forth&mdash;</P>
<P>"Farewell! Forgive me, if I for another mo|ment rob you of repo&s;e. I forgot to &s;how you the dear little child, the pledge of our affection."</P>
<P>With the&s;e words &s;he drew the King, (who&s;e confu&s;ion evidently increa&s;ed) partly by force, to the cradle, in which the innocent was &s;lumbering.</P>
<P>"Look!" &s;aid &s;he, "here is your &s;on. Ki&s;s him, and ble&s;s him, that with his father's ble&s;&s;ing and his mother's love, he may bid defiance to the &s;torms which Fate perhaps has &s;pread above him."</P>
<P>The King bent to his fir&s;t-born &s;on, and ki&s;&s;ed him; a tear dropped upon his little hand.</P>
<P>"For the &s;ake of that tear," cried Ildegerte, "I forgive thee."</P>
<P>She vani&s;hed in the inner apartment.&mdash;Theodo|ric was thunder&s;truck; he followed her with fixed eye, and willingly had otherwi&s;e interpreted her words than his con&s;cience too plainly pointed out. Long he &s;tood irre&s;olute. His heart drew him to Ildegerte's feet, there to confe&s;s his crime, and &s;ue to her affection for pardon. But then the demon Policy whi&s;pered in his ear&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="037753_0143_100F2801E719FE98">
"Too far ha&s;t thou proceeded. Already does the ocean bear the Swedi&s;h Prince&s;s to thy &s;hores; thou can&s;t but proceed; to retreat a &s;tep is war and death."</P>
<P>He turned mournfully around, reached his chamber without knowing how, and &s;ought that repo&s;e which is granted only to the good.</P>
<P>All was again &s;ilent. No foot&s;tep echoed through the lone&s;ome galleries of the vaulted pa|lace. Ildegerte dried her tears, and demanded of her companion whether it was midnight.</P>
<P>"It is," an&s;wered &s;he. "All is quiet; above us &s;hines the northern &s;tar."</P>
<P>"'Tis well!" cried the Queen; "let us be|gone. Alas! how is my heart oppre&s;&s;ed! Where is my &s;on?"</P>
<P>"He's &s;till a&s;leep," &s;aid Helga.</P>
<P>Ildegerte approached the cradle, and &s;urveyed him with maternal affection.</P>
<P>"Look, Helga, how calmly innocence can &s;leep. Is his father's re&s;t &s;o undi&s;turbed? Oh! How ea&s;y is it to di&s;cover the traces of con&s;cience in the features of any one a&s;leep! When the weary eye is clo&s;ed, the recollection of evil or of good &s;teals from the deep rece&s;&s;es of the heart, &s;ettles upon the countenance, and is manife&s;t in
<PB N="44" REF="037753_0144_100F2804533BC460">
convul&s;ive motions, or a gentle &s;mile. What a pity to di&s;turb the innocent's delightful dreams! But his mother has been rou&s;ed by the hand of mi&s;ery from the mo&s;t delightful of all dreams!&mdash;the dream of love, and yet dare not complain. Away! I hear the crowing of the cock; away, before the morning dawns!"</P>
<P>Helga took the little &s;lumberer in her arms, and he awoke not. Ildegerte with &s;ilent caution pre|ceded her companion through the dark pa&s;&s;ages, and reached at la&s;t a little gate, which was open|ed to her by a trabant, bought over to her intere&s;t.&mdash;She ca&s;t back another mournful look.</P>
<P>"This palace I entered in triumph," &s;aid &s;he, "through yonder &s;pacious portals, and am now doomed to fly from it like a criminal through this &s;mall gate. At that time the &s;un &s;parkled in a tear of joy, but now the moon in the tear of mi|&s;ery. Perfidious hu&s;band! Away, that I may not cur&s;e the recollection of him!"</P>
<P>She &s;poke, and took little Haldan in her arms, (for her affection could not even tru&s;t him to the faithful Helga), and carefully carried him now through pathle&s;s fore&s;ts, now over craggy cliffs, and now over bottomle&s;s mora&s;&s;es. The night was cold, but large drops trickled from the heroine's
<PB N="45" REF="037753_0145_100F28071F4B98C0">
forehead. Her face and hands were lacerated by the briars; her feet, wounded by the pointed flints, left their bloody marks imprinted in the &s;and. Already had they been wandering for two hours, when the Queen a&s;ked Helga whether &s;he was weary.</P>
<P>"I dare not tell a fal&s;hood," replied &s;he; "I am very weary."</P>
<P>"True," &s;aid Ildegerte; "you have no pre|cious burden to &s;catter ro&s;es on your path. For|give me, faithful Helga."</P>
<P>"I am a&s;hamed," an&s;wered &s;he; "I'll follow you to death."</P>
<P>They continued their way. As yet they felt not the refre&s;hing &s;ea-breeze. The thickets grew more impenetrable, the path le&s;s beaten.</P>
<P>"Methinks," &s;aid Helga, "the morning dawns. Do you &s;ee that purple &s;tripe in the ea&s;t? Alas! what if the &s;un betray us!"</P>
<P>"Courage! Courage!" exclaimed Ildegerte. "We &s;hall e&s;cape; the night has led us too much to the left; at break of day we &s;hall di&s;cern our road."</P>
<P>The fugitives, urged by anxiety, redoubled their efforts. They &s;prung like kids from cliff to cliff; they crept like &s;erpents through the interwoven
<PB N="46" REF="037753_0146_100F294C11230238">
bu&s;hes. Panting like hunted deer, they forced their way through brooks and &s;wampy fens.</P>
<P>At once a thick fog aro&s;e, which dimmed the breaking day, and &s;pread a &s;econd night around them, far more impenetrable than the former, which had been enlightened by the moon and &s;tars. The unhappy Queen covered the child with all the garments &s;he could &s;pare, in order to defend him from the chilly rawne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere. She &s;ummoned all her re&s;olution to oppo&s;e the horrors of her &s;ituation, and had &s;till a word of comfort left for Helga.</P>
<P>Alas! poor helple&s;s wretches! What avails it that ye wander thus, be&s;meared with blood, in tears, and breathle&s;s? Do you know whither you are flying? Can you di&s;cern the tree clo&s;e to you? Are you certain that &s;ome ho&s;tile demon is not leading you through this labyrinth back to the Pa|lace gate? Perhaps at that very moment the &s;un|beams may di&s;per&s;e the fog, exhibiting your man|gled per&s;ons to the deri&s;ion of the Court and Hell.</P>
<P>"Oh Queen!" cried Helga, falling on a &s;tone, "forgive me, I can go no further."</P>
<P>"Ye Gods! this is too much," cried Ildegerte. "Burden me not, Odin, beyond what I am able
<PB N="47" REF="037753_0147_100F294D9C1646F0">
to bear. Collect this mi&s;t into a thunder-cloud, and launch the dart of Hela to my heart."</P>
<P>She threw her&s;elf upon the damp cold earth, clo&s;e to her friend, pre&s;&s;ed little Haldan feebly to her bo&s;om, and warmed him with her tears.</P>
<P>The flood-gates of Heaven opened.&mdash;Forth gu&s;hed a torrent from the &s;kies, accompanied by hall; the brooks were &s;woln beyond their banks, and the fields inundated; the mi&s;erable fugitives were completely drenched. Rapid &s;treams rolled pa&s;t them, and in huge drops a river &s;eemed to fall from every tree.</P>
<P>Haldan (who till now had &s;lept as &s;oundly in his mother's arms beneath the canopy of angry Heaven, as on a bed of down in the palace of his father,) awoke, as at la&s;t the rain, in &s;pite of Ildegerte's care, had forced its way. He awoke, and availed him&s;elf of the only arms which Nature (bounte|ous to every bea&s;t, to man alone penurious) had granted him. He cried &s;o loudly and piteou&s;ly that his voice rent the heart of his afflicted mo|ther, more than the thorns her feet and hands. Fruitle&s;s were her care&s;&s;es, fruitle&s;s the offer of her brea&s;t, in which mi&s;ery had dried all nouri&s;h|ment. At la&s;t her courage, her belief in a Provi|dence, who &s;uperintends the &s;ufferings of inno|cence,
<PB N="48" REF="037753_0148_100F294F313922A0">
for&s;ook her; mad with de&s;pair and angui&s;h, &s;he wrung her hands, and cur&s;ed her exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Hark!</P>
<P>In the thickets barked a dog&mdash;not far di&s;tant &s;eemed the &s;ound; fre&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, and &s;trength, in&s;pired the weary Queen.&mdash;She &s;prung nimbly on her feet, &s;tretched forth her hand to her exhau&s;ted friend, rai&s;ed her, commanded her to lean upon her arm, removed with her left hand the clo&s;e-ce|mented bu&s;hes, cla&s;ped with her right the infant Haldan, and thus followed the &s;ound, which &s;till &s;eemed nearer and nearer.</P>
<P>Suddenly &s;he &s;tood before a &s;mall hut, which, over&s;hadowed by thick interwoven branches, bade defiance to every &s;torm.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall find &s;ome one here," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion I &s;hall excite by the artle&s;s account of my di&s;tre&s;&s;es. But if not, be my la&s;t re&s;ource&mdash;this dagger."</P>
<P>Thus prepared for all, Ildegerte boldly knocked at the door of the little hut. But who can de&s;cribe her a&s;toni&s;hment, when a female voice called from within&mdash;</P>
<P>"Hail, Queen of Denmark and Norway! En|ter! Enter! Come to my &s;ire, thou, Prince Hal|dan, and the faithful Helga."</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="037753_0149_100F29530375A2A8">
At once the door flew from its hinges, and our heroine beheld &s;itting, at a blazing fire, a decrepit old woman, who, with pal&s;ied head, tottered to|wards her, &s;eized her hand, and conducted her to a kind of couch, made of &s;oft mo&s;s and twi&s;ted &s;edge. With benevolent &s;olicitude &s;he took the little Prince from her arms, laid him near the fire upon a bed of ro&s;es and &s;weet-&s;cented herbs, went to milk her goats, and appea&s;ed his hunger. She then brought fruits and bread, with a cordial drink made by her&s;elf of honey and berries; at the &s;ame time &s;he encouraged her gue&s;ts by friendly conver|&s;ation, pre&s;&s;ing them to partake of her homely cheer, and not to de&s;pi&s;e her poverty, for &s;he gave them what her little garden and cellar would al|low.</P>
<P>"When you," &s;aid &s;he, "are recovered from the hard&s;hips you have encountered in the night, I will conduct you, by the neare&s;t road, to the &s;ea|&s;hore. To be &s;ure 'tis long &s;ince I for&s;ook my hut, for age and infirmity are &s;i&s;ters; but to-day, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my &s;tick, I will contrive to hobble along, for I think it well worth my trou|ble to &s;acrifice the remnant of my &s;trength in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;o good a Queen. Fear not; you will not be pur&s;ued; the &s;hip lies unob&s;erved within a

&s;ecret bay, the wind is fair, and ere the &s;un has half-fulfilled his cour&s;e, the coa&s;t of Denmark will have vani&s;hed from your view."</P>
<P>The good Queen &s;tared at her with a&s;toni&s;hment, not knowing how to &s;olve the my&s;tery. The old woman &s;eemed as well acquainted with her every &s;ecret as if &s;he had been the companion of her youth, and never left her &s;ide.</P>
<P>"Who art thou, unaccountable?" &s;tammered Ildegerte in a tone of &s;u&s;picion; "who art thou, before who&s;e eye the book of Fate lies open?"</P>
<P>"I am," replied &s;he, "Suanhilda, the &s;orce|re&s;s, who&s;e name perhaps has reached your ears."</P>
<P>A &s;acred reverential impul&s;e &s;eized the Queen. She had often heard at her hu&s;band's Court of this miraculous woman, of her wonderous &s;kill in magic and divination. But an in&s;tant before &s;he had been convinced that Fame had not exaggerated it. It would have been folly to conceal her &s;ecret from &s;uch a favourite of the Gods: &s;he therefore wi&s;ely determined to reveal to the old woman what the latter long had known, and implore her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Suanhilda promi&s;ed, and fulfilled her promi&s;e; for as &s;oon as the wanderers had dried their clothes, healed their wounds, and &s;atisfied their hunger, &s;he gra&s;ped her &s;taff, and led her gue&s;ts (as quick
<PB N="51" REF="037753_0151_100F2956BA8B9C20">
as the weight of a hundred years, which &s;he bore upon her back, would allow) by a &s;mooth path, known only to her&s;elf, to the &s;ea-&s;hore, where the crew joyfully hailed their freight, and a bri&s;k breeze &s;welled the canva&s;s. The &s;un, no longer hid by clouds, now &s;parkled in the rippling waves. Suan|hilda embraced Ildegerte.</P>
<P>"Farewell," &s;aid &s;he, with an awful &s;olemnity, while &s;he gazed full in the horoine's face, and a more than mortal in&s;piration over&s;pread her fea|tures; "farewell, till thou and thy thou&s;ands are borne upon the ocean back to the coa&s;t of Den|mark, where the de&s;olated fields imbibe the grate|ful dew of Heaven, mingled with floods of gore, where the wretched pea&s;ant groans to thee for help and for deliverance, where Trea&s;on &s;preads its &s;ooty pinions o'er the Palace.&mdash;Welcome, Oh heroine, amid the &s;houts of multitudes! Triumph and con|quer, thrice ble&s;&s;ed mother of Kings! Thy name &s;hall be named in di&s;tant ages, and behold! thy children's children pa&s;s before me, clad in purple, bearing the &s;ceptre of Norway, which is decorated with the ever-blooming trophies, earned by Ilde|gerte."</P>
<P>The old woman, from a hillock near the &s;hore, &s;till continued her prophetic ble&s;&s;ings, when a

<P>The voyage was pro&s;perous, the weather favour|able. In a few days the heroine reached her native &s;hores, and fled to the ca&s;tle in the woods, which had before heard her lamentations for the lo&s;s of Thora, and concealed her angui&s;h for the death of Swend.</P>
<P>BACK to the palace of the poor deluded King, where (to borrow a &s;imile from Monte&s;quieu) all is lifele&s;s animation, and every one a walking &s;tatue!</P>

<P>"Let her come," &s;aid he, affrighted, and fore|boding &s;omething unu&s;ual. The crim&s;on flew into his face, he half-rai&s;ed him&s;elf from his couch, and leaning on his elbow, fixed his eye upon the door.</P>

Take back the diadem, which ambition never placed upon my brow; I lay it voluntarily at your feet, to e&s;cape the in&s;ult which &s;o unde&s;er|vedly awaited me. The rank to which you rai&s;ed me, has not extingui&s;hed the recollection of that

to which I &s;hall return. Let no lamentation fol|low me; my heart will feel no want but your's, which I have lo&s;t. Live happy and content, if the &s;ituation in which I leave you can afford con|tent and happine&s;s. I ha&s;ten to the woods of Norway, there to &s;eek that peace which I never felt upon your throne.

</LETTER>
<P>I leave it to your imagination, reader, to depict the impre&s;&s;ion which this &s;olemn adieu made upon his heart, &s;tormed as it was on every &s;ide. You know he was no villain, though his weakne&s;s, his too ea&s;y flexibility led him to commit more crimes than Harold, with all his villany, could perpetrate. At this moment all his tenderne&s;s awoke; he again beheld in Ildegerte his amiable wife, the mo|ther of his &s;on.&mdash;He again reflected on her exalted virtues and unmerited di&s;tre&s;&s;es; he re&s;olved to act like a man, and wept like a child. He determined boldly to &s;urmount all the ob&s;tacles of policy, but, in&s;tead of in&s;tantly executing what the angel of Virtue whi&s;pered, to make Harold fir&s;t acquainted
<PB N="55" REF="037753_0155_100F295FECF88320">
with this alteration in his &s;entiments. The fa|vourite was &s;ummoned.</P>
<P>"Read, Harold, read!" reaching with trem|bling hand the open letter. "Read! give me thy advice, and calm, if po&s;&s;ible, the tumult which rages in my heart."</P>
<P>Harold took the paper, and peru&s;ed it.&mdash;The flight of Ildegerte was to him a thunder-bolt, which bla&s;ted at one blow his brighte&s;t hopes. Yet could the eye of one, endowed with a knowledge of mankind, read likewi&s;e in the generous renunciation which the&s;e lines conveyed, the &s;ure&s;t method to regain Theodoric's wavering heart. This mu&s;t be prevented; di&s;&s;imulation was more nece&s;&s;ary now than ever. Harold with difficulty tried to force a &s;mile, clo&s;ed the letter, thru&s;t it in his bo&s;om, and a&s;&s;uming an air of indifference, demanded&mdash;</P>
<P>"What does the King intend to do?"</P>
<P>"What he mu&s;t do," replied Theodoric, "if he will obey the dictates of his heart; what he mu&s;t do, if he will lay claim to a title far above that of King&mdash;the title of an upright man."</P>
<P>"But there is a wide difference," &s;aid the Prince, "between an upright King and an upright individual. The latter can by no means be con|cerned in our pre&s;ent deliberation; the former
<PB N="56" REF="037753_0156_100F29620B4ADE80">
mu&s;t not con&s;ult his heart, but the opinion of the nation."</P>
<P>"And of his own accord linger all his life upon the rock of con&s;cience?" cried Theodoric.</P>
<P>"If he will &s;uffer his imagination," an&s;wered Harold, "to bind him to the rock, why, yes."</P>
<P>"Sorry I am, then," rejoined the King, "that I am a &s;lave to mine. Spare your words; &s;end a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el in&s;tantly to Norway for her; &s;end an amba&s;&s;ador in&s;tantly to Sweden. I will not &s;ee the Prince&s;s, I will not hear her name again."</P>
<P>"The ho&s;tile army," replied Harold, "will bellow it loudly enough in your ears. What am|ba&s;&s;ador can I &s;end? who of all your &s;ubjects will &s;tep forward to be torn in pieces by ju&s;t exa&s;pera|tion? Hermanfried would rave, Luitgardis with tears in&s;pire each arm. Every noble Swede would rather die a thou&s;and deaths than &s;uffer &s;uch an in&s;ult to be unrevenged. Already do I &s;ee them bur&s;t upon us like fragments of broken rocks; al|ready do I &s;ee them de&s;olate thy fertile kingdom, butcher thy &s;ubjects, and en&s;lave their children; already do I hear thy faithful followers cur&s;e thy weakne&s;s, which drags them thus to &s;laughter for a woman's &s;ake. The welfare of the &s;tate is your fir&s;t law; this Ildegerte her&s;elf confe&s;&s;es by

her voluntary re&s;ignation; you &s;hould be obliged to her for having made the &s;tep more ea&s;y, which co&s;ts your heart, as I perceive, &s;o much."</P>
<P>"Alas!" exclaimed Theodoric, "what mu&s;t become of her? Is &s;he doomed, as a reward for all her love and valour, only to hunt the bears in Norway's fore&s;ts?"</P>
<P>"Not &s;o," an&s;wered Harold. "You may, by a thou&s;and little favours, alleviate her lot. Let her retain, as heretofore, the title of Queen, that will flatter her ambition. Let her have a con&s;ider|able revenue, that will procure the conveniences of life."</P>
<P>"But her heart&mdash;?" &s;aid the King.</P>
<P>"That," replied the Prince, "will be more open to a mother's joys, more clo&s;ely connected to her &s;on, and will find its reward in the reflection of having contributed to the happine&s;s of a whole nation."</P>
<P>"And I&mdash;?" proceeded Theodoric, with a deep &s;igh.</P>
<P>"To that que&s;tion," an&s;wered he, pre&s;enting a miniature, "let the original of this reply."</P>
<P>"What is it?" cried the King, eagerly.</P>
<P>"The beauteous copy of a &s;till more beauteous girl," &s;aid Harold.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="037753_0158_100F2966C6399508">
"And the original?" demanded he.</P>
<P>"I dare not name," returned Harold; "you have forbidden it."</P>
<P>"Luitgardis?" a&s;ked he, impatiently.</P>
<P>"The &s;ame," &s;aid the Prince.</P>
<P>Theodoric riveted his eye upon the picture.</P>
<P>"She is hand&s;ome."&mdash;A pau&s;e.&mdash;"Beautiful!"&mdash;Another pau&s;e&mdash;"Enchanting!"</P>
<P>"And yet," rejoined Harold, "'tis thought the painter has but ill &s;ucceeded in the expre&s;&s;ion of that gentle &s;oul which animates the&s;e features. He was unable to &s;teal from her that &s;mile, which &s;he &s;eems to have &s;tolen from the godde&s;s Freya."</P>
<P>"Who brought it?" a&s;ked Theodoric.</P>
<P>"A me&s;&s;enger," returned the Prince, "who, at the &s;ame time, announces the near approach of the Prince&s;s. He reports that, at his departure from the Court, &s;he purpo&s;ed to remain but three days longer, and as he has been by accident detain|ed upon the road, he expects her to be clo&s;e behind him."</P>
<P>"So &s;oon?" cried Theodoric. "Before we are prepared for her reception?"</P>
<P>"Heed not that," &s;aid the villain; "only pre|pare your heart, and to your faithful Harold leave the re&s;t."</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="037753_0159_100F296864E023C8">
"Ha&s;te then!" exclaimed the King.&mdash;"Let no decoration or magnificence be wanting. Fame de&s;cribes her Brother's Court as &s;plendid; I &s;hould not wi&s;h her to mi&s;s here what cu&s;tom may have rendered requi&s;ite."</P>
<P>"Every co&s;tly ornament," &s;aid Harold, "which your royal trea&s;ure can procure, &s;he &s;hall find in her apartments. Add to this," continued he, in a jocular tone, "the value which &s;uch a pre&s;ent gains from your hand, and methinks Luitgardis will be &s;atisfied."</P>
<P>The Prince was now going, when Theodoric detained him, by a&s;king for the letter.</P>
<P>"It were better, kin&s;man," rejoined Harold, "not to read it a &s;econd time."</P>
<P>"It at lea&s;t de&s;erves an an&s;wer," ob&s;erved the King.</P>
<P>"It does," returned Harold, "and I advi&s;e you to accompany it with pre&s;ents. Fail not al&s;o to call her Queen, and command the nobles who take it to bend the knee, as is meet when they approach the con&s;ort of their King."</P>
<P>"And to convince her, by irre&s;i&s;tible elo|quence," proceeded Theodoric, fixing his eye up|on the picture, "of the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity which obliges
<PB N="60" REF="037753_0160_100F296ADA598F48">
me, &s;o contrary to the wi&s;hes of my faithful heart&mdash;"</P>
<P>"And &s;o forth," interrupted Harold.&mdash;"Yes, yes; but allow me to &s;tate another doubt which has occurred to me. If I am wrong my zeal for your &s;afety mu&s;t &s;erve as my excu&s;e. Would it not be conformable to the dictates of caution, if you were to &s;tation a few troops on the confines of Norway?"</P>
<P>"Why &s;o?" demanded he.</P>
<P>"How ea&s;ily," &s;aid Harold&mdash;"pardon me, 'tis but a &s;uppo&s;ition, yet it is founded on a knowledge of the &s;ex, which, when &s;lighted, ever thir&s;ts for vengeance&mdash;how if Ildegerte, who in her native land has powerful intere&s;t, were to excite your &s;ub|jects to revolt?"</P>
<P>"Peace!" cried the King. "Her noble &s;oul cannot be capable of &s;uch a thought."</P>
<P>"Of what cannot the &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ions make a woman capable?" an&s;wered he.&mdash;"Who ever yet repented caution? And, why is it nece&s;&s;ary that the purpo&s;e for which your troops are &s;ent thither &s;hould be known?"</P>
<P>"No," exclaimed the King, "it cannot be. I'll hear no more; not a &s;ingle man &s;hall approach the borders, and tho&s;e at pre&s;ent &s;cattered in that
<PB N="61" REF="037753_0161_100F296DC506BE40">
di&s;trict, &s;hall immediately return, that Ildegerte may not think me guilty of harbouring the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion."</P>
<P>"As you plea&s;e," concluded Harold, "I have but done my duty."</P>
<P>The hypocrite departed. His deluded friend, (who had &s;o often &s;acrificed the &s;ub&s;tance for the &s;hadow) &s;ought con&s;olation in the picture of the Swedi&s;h prince&s;s, and tried, by gazing at her lovely features, to drive from his remembrance the tear which perhaps at that moment trickled down the cheek of Ildegerte. He convinced him&s;elf that he had done every thing which love and genero&s;ity demanded. Had he been but a &s;ubject, rea&s;oned he, no power on earth &s;hould have forced him to lo&s;e Ildegerte; he would have fled with her to a de&s;ert; wild herbs would, at her &s;ide, have been luxuries, and water nectar. But Fate had placed him in a &s;tation which we mortals are for ever painting the mo&s;t arduous and unenviable, which, however, not one in a thou&s;and voluntarily quits, and which none of us, who thus de&s;pi&s;e it, would refu&s;e, if it were offered. What remains to be done? He has but two alternatives; he mu&s;t either audaciou&s;ly oppo&s;e the will of the Gods, and the intreaties of his &s;ubjects, or ca&s;t away the purple,
<PB N="62" REF="037753_0162_100F296FDC450B98">
and retire to Norway's woods, there to die poor and unknown, yet at the &s;ide of Ildegerte. The fir&s;t no mortal dares to do, the latter he mu&s;t not; for to leave a flock without a &s;hepherd would be cruelty, and to rob his heirs of their paternal right would be madne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus the &s;ophi&s;t quietly &s;ubmits to his de&s;tiny, writes a luke-warm letter full of forced apologies to Ildegerte, tries to make amends by co&s;tly pre|&s;ents for what the &s;tyle may want in affection, and wonders when &s;he &s;ends the pre&s;ents back, nor deigns to write him a reply. He terms her con|duct haughty, thinks he has a right to talk of un|de&s;erved injuries, and feels a &s;ecret joy in having found another cover for his perfidy.</P>
<P>Well is it for the villain, who can thus rock his con&s;cience to repo&s;e. Even Theodoric envies him, for he is not always able thus to impo&s;e upon him|&s;elf by &s;ophi&s;try.</P>
<P>A THOUSAND times has it been &s;aid, (and fal&s;ely &s;aid) that the path of &s;eduction is only &s;trew|ed with ro&s;es. True it is, the further one ad|vances, the more ea&s;y &s;eems the way, the more
<PB N="63" REF="037753_0163_100F297168E2EB40">
numerous the&s;e &s;hort-lived flowers. This, how|ever, is not at the beginning of the road, but where it deviates from the path of Virtue. There has Virtue &s;cattered many a thorn, which, from time to time, benevolently tears the thoughtle&s;s wanderer's foot, to make him attentive to the way which he is chu&s;ing.</P>
<P>Luitgardis came. On every &s;ide triumphal arches were erected. The &s;treets were adorned with branches, the windows decked with garlands, and each clad in his be&s;t attire. A magnificent proce&s;&s;ion paraded in honour of the fe&s;tive day, but the countenances of the a&s;&s;embled multitude gave the lie to their garments; no joyful &s;hout &s;aluted the young couple; all was &s;ilent as if a fu|neral were pa&s;&s;ing, and Theodoric, at the &s;ide of Luitgardis, felt the bittere&s;t mortification. He commanded meat and bread, as well as intoxicating liquors, to be given to the populace. All refu&s;ed to ta&s;te them, and crowded to the temple of Odin, where, &s;ince the la&s;t battle, Ildegerte had hung her lance and helmet, which they bedewed with tears.</P>
<P>Theodoric heard it, and his heart bled.</P>
<P>All &s;eemed to combine on this day to plant a thou&s;and daggers in his heart. Sir Siegwin, an
<PB N="64" REF="037753_0164_100F2973830F14C0">
old Swede, (the &s;ame who conveyed the body of Canfried from the field of battle, and &s;lew Swend's murderer) came in the &s;uite of Luitgardis to deli|ver the young Prince&s;s to the King: but &s;carce had he performed this errand, ere he &s;prung upon his &s;teed to return home.</P>
<P>"Whither &s;o &s;oon?" cried the a&s;toni&s;hed King. "Will you affront me &s;o much as to refu&s;e the cup of joy upon the day of my nuptials?"</P>
<P>"Sir," &s;aid old Siegwin, "do you remember our interchange of friend&s;hip on the field of battle? My King commanded me to accompany the Prin|ce&s;s; I have delivered her to you. My friend&s;hip I take back."</P>
<P>Without waiting a reply he &s;purred his &s;teed, and vani&s;hed from the &s;ight of the aba&s;hed Theo|doric, who&s;e con&s;cience loudly called to him&mdash;</P>
<P>'"Thou de&s;erve&s;t not the friend&s;hip of &s;o worthy a man."'</P>
<P>Thus did the viperous tooth of Con&s;cience gnaw every mor&s;el that he ate, taint every drop he drank, and poi&s;on every ki&s;s he imprinted on the lips of his bride.</P>
<P>And Luitgardis? Oh! &s;he was a good harmle&s;s being, ever gay and ever happy.&mdash;She &s;aw no fur|ther than it was wi&s;hed &s;he &s;hould &s;ee, and enjoyed
<PB N="65" REF="037753_0165_100F29762E3ECE60">
the plea&s;ures of the pre&s;ent hour, regardle&s;s of the next.</P>
<P>And Harold? 'Tis time to return to him, who&s;e well-concerted plan had been defeated by the flight of Ildegerte, and whom you perhaps fancy con|tented with the thought of having &s;o completely revenged his &s;lighted love, and re&s;olved calmly to enjoy the fruits of this revenge. Nothing le&s;s. Harold (like a &s;kilful che&s;s-player, who always knows how to give another turn to his game, when a movement of his adver&s;ary has defeated his fir&s;t-plan) now aimed at the throne of his forefathers (as he termed it), even without the help of Swe|den. He had not a moment's doubt but that his hand would be accepted, when he had it in his power to make the offer from a throne. Notwith|&s;tanding all his craft and knowledge of mankind, he &s;ometimes fell into the &s;ame mi&s;take as attaches to the re&s;t of us poor mortals.&mdash;He attributed to each character unintentionally &s;ome mixture of his own, by which mi&s;take it came to pa&s;s, that as he laid down fal&s;e po&s;itions, fal&s;e con&s;equences en&s;ued. He could as little fancy the patient and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Ildegerte, as the Greeks a Juno, without jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>"Let me but be a King," was his fal&s;e argu|ment, "and &s;he will be ready enough to &s;natch at
<PB N="66" REF="037753_0166_100F29784C1BBB40">
any opportunity of convincing Theodoric that she can be a Queen in spite of him."</P>
<P>ALMIGHTY Ruler of creation! Is it not enough that an audacious despot shall be able to destroy that noble emulation, the axis upon which all republican states turn, and substitute his mad ambition? Must even Love, that gentle child of Heaven, formed only for the consolation of suffer|ing humanity, afford him a pretext?</P>
<P>Already was Harold, the favourite, possessed of a blind confidence, lord over the revenues of the kingdom, lord over the strongest forts, lord over the army; for he had ever contrived to remove from the throne the faithful and deserving patriot, and to supply the place by a creature devoted to his will. And who can deny that Theodoric assisted the traitor in his projects? Had he not lost the love of his people by banishing their idol, Ilde|gerte? What had he been since that time, but a mark for their derision and contempt? Alas! but too easy access did Harold find to their hearts. He complained with the discontented, plotted with
<PB N="67" REF="037753_0167_100F2979DA673B48">
the di&s;affected, and, in a &s;hort time, beheld him|&s;elf at the head of a powerful party, who eagerly awaited the &s;ignal for revolt. Nothing was want|ing but a favourable opportunity, and the demon of di&s;cord failed not to provide it.</P>
<P>Theodoric, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a lovely wife, a double crown, an unmole&s;ted peace, was wretched; for the joys of the bridal bed, the grandeur of the diadem, the &s;mile of peace &s;tilled not the voice of his accu&s;er, Con&s;cience. He avoided him&s;elf, and the whole world; he launched eagerly into every di&s;&s;ipation; he endeavoured to forget the pa&s;t amid the noi&s;y bu&s;tle of the Court. In vain, in vain! An irk&s;ome di&s;gu&s;t attended him, even to the arms of the beauteous Luitgardis. The &s;ociety of each contemptible court minion &s;oon became indi&s;pen&s;i|ble, becau&s;e his &s;hallow brain could daily hammer forth new means of di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>Harold availed him&s;elf of this &s;tate of mind, and, by one of his parti&s;ans, cau&s;ed the King to fall upon the idea of making a tour through his realms.</P>
<P>"Excellent! Excellent!" cried the cheated mo|narch. "We &s;hall be daily amu&s;ed by new ob|jects, we &s;hall hear the petitions of the di&s;tant pro|vinces.
<PB N="68" REF="037753_0168_100F297B97D46EF0">
Quick! make in&s;tant preparations, that the plea&s;ant &s;ea&s;on may not pa&s;s."</P>
<P>His impatience was beyond all bounds; every delay intolerable; not a hand was there in the pa|lace unemployed. In a few days he left the me|tropolis, having appointed Prince Harold the un|limited Regent during his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>This was the moment which the favourite had awaited. He daily received me&s;&s;engers from the King, announcing the continuance of his journey; and &s;carce did he know him far enough advanced towards the confines, when he at once threw away the ma&s;k, a&s;&s;embled his creatures round him, took the young Queen into cu&s;tody, overpowered the few who were faithful to Theodoric, and was joy|fully hailed by the infatuated populace, King of Denmark.</P>
<P>He mounted the throne with affected mode&s;ty, heard and determined every cau&s;e in per&s;on, re|pealed &s;ome taxes which were heavy on the people, doubled the allowance of the army, &s;acrificed to the Gods, gifted the prie&s;ts, amu&s;ed the vulgar by a few hired jugglers, publi&s;hed a plau&s;ible mani|fe&s;to, indi&s;putably proving his right to the throne, and thus &s;ecured his booty without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Indi&s;&s;olubly, as he thought, was the knot of
<PB N="69" REF="037753_0169_100F297E4C5EAFE0">
power now tied; and on the &s;ummit of his gran|deur he felt no other wi&s;h than the gratification of his lu&s;t. He &s;eized the pen, and wrote&mdash;</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Harold, King of Denmark, to Queen Ildegerte.</HEAD>

</LETTER>
<P>A &s;plendid emba&s;&s;y was di&s;patched to Norway to deliver this letter, and to convey Ildegerte tri|umphant to the coa&s;t of Denmark.</P>
<P>Immoveable, as if &s;truck by Odin's thunder|bolt, &s;tood the weak Theodoric, on hearing the dreadful tidings brought by a faithful fugitive. Long his tongue refu&s;ed its office, and the fir&s;t ex|clamation that quivered on his lips, was&mdash;</P>

&s;tands naked and defencele&s;s. For&s;aken by his friends and &s;ubjects, without an army, without money, without coun&s;el, hu&s;band of two wives, and unable to &s;eek comfort in the bo&s;om of either&mdash;this is the image of the wretch, who, torn by a thou&s;and agonies, extingui&s;hes the indignation which his weakne&s;s had excited in our hearts.</P>
<P>He wandered from city to city&mdash;the gates were &s;hut to him; he fled from village to village&mdash;&s;carce did &s;ome hone&s;t pea&s;ant &s;hare with him his mor&s;el of coar&s;e bread.</P>
<P>Thus did he &s;teal through a thou&s;and dangers to the remote&s;t province of his kingdom, the only one &s;till faithful to him. Here he collected a band of a few thou&s;ands, headed them, and boldly marched again&s;t the robber of his crown; but as he dared not hope for victory, he re&s;olved in de|&s;pair to ru&s;h upon the &s;word of the foe, and fini&s;h his mi&s;erable being on the field of battle.</P>
<P>Harold laughed at his temerity, braced on his armour, a&s;&s;embled his innumerable troops, headed them, and fiercely &s;allied forth to complete the &s;ubjection of the kingdom, and chain his rival to the triumphal carriage, which was to bear him and Ildegerte to the altar of Siofna. He daily expected the return of the amba&s;&s;adors from Norway, and
<PB N="71" REF="037753_0171_100F2982A19BF160">
was at a lo&s;s to account for their long &s;tay. But he con&s;oled him&s;elf with the idea, that when all had &s;ubmitted to the victor, he might re&s;t the more ea&s;y in the arms of love.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the two armies (if Theodoric's &s;mall band de&s;erve the name of army) had approached each other. Theodoric wi&s;hed for battle, Harold avoided it; not becau&s;e he had the &s;malle&s;t doubt of a deci&s;ive victory, but he would take the rebels (as he termed them) alive, &s;urround them by &s;upe|rior force, and compel them, by famine, to &s;ur|render their &s;hadow of a King. Every thing &s;eem|ed to favour this project. In a barren valley, de|void of water, the incon&s;iderate King had pitched his tents. Every avenue was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the ene|my. Bread began to fall, and the burning thir&s;t of the loyal troops was quenched only by the dew of Heaven. A few excur&s;ions were hazarded; each time the little band returned dimini&s;hed. The peo|ple murmured, and con&s;idered them&s;elves as &s;heep led to &s;laughter.&mdash;The impul&s;e of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation awoke, and ea&s;ily overpowered the enthu&s;ia&s;tic idea of an unalterable allegiance to their &s;overeign. Ha|rold daily &s;ent di&s;gui&s;ed impo&s;tors to the camp, who offered pardon to all the wavering, if they
<PB N="72" REF="037753_0172_100F2984F0F91048">
would voluntarily &s;urrender, and deliver their King into his power.</P>
<P>"Why this delay?" &s;aid they. "Your bre|thren have yielded to the conqueror, and are hap|py. The new King is gracious; he will be a fa|ther to you; but beware how you provoke his wrath. Can you think, with a handful of men, to oppo&s;e hunger, thir&s;t, and an innumerable army? Harold could long &s;ince have annihilated your poor band, had he not pitied you infatuation, and wi&s;hed to &s;pare the blood of his &s;ubjects, (for as &s;uch he &s;till con&s;iders you). Seize and ki&s;s the hand which a father offers, ere you too late repent your ob&s;ti|nacy."</P>
<P>The&s;e addre&s;&s;es naturally made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of tho&s;e who heard them. They combined, and determined to offer the &s;acrifice re|quired, in order to &s;ave them&s;elves from inevita|ble ruin.</P>
<P>Thus helple&s;s was the &s;ituation of poor Theodo|ric. The de&s;ign of his followers was not unknown to him, and each moment he expected to be drag|ged in chains before the traitor, whom he had once loaded with kindne&s;&s;es. This idea was to him in|&s;upportable. Once more his courage awoke:</P>
<P>"Rather die than increa&s;e Harold's triumph."
<PB N="73" REF="037753_0173_100F2987913A4740">
Thus &s;poke he to him&s;elf, and prepared a cup of poi&s;on, which he was ju&s;t about to &s;wallow, when E&s;cill entered his tent. He announced a woman, who, with a ba&s;ket of fruit, had &s;tolen through the enemy, and de&s;ired to &s;peak with him.&mdash;Scarce had he fini&s;hed, when the woman entered.</P>
<P>"Helga!" cried the King. "Art thou here? Is it po&s;&s;ible?"</P>
<P>Helga &s;ilently greeted him, and delivered a letter.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Ildegerte to Theodoric, King of Denmark and Norway.</HEAD>
<P>"This moment I have landed, on the coa&s;t of Denmark, &s;ix thou&s;and Amazons and eight thou|&s;and hardy Norwegians. I ha&s;ten to relieve you; I &s;hall reach you in a few days. When our war|like &s;houts announce our approach, bur&s;t from your camp, ru&s;h boldly on the u&s;urper's front, while I attack him on the rear. My life and blood are your's."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>"God of Heaven!" exclaimed Theodoric, while a flood of tears gu&s;hed down his face, and not knowing what he did, he cla&s;ped the faithful Helga in his arms. "Is it not a dream? So much genero&s;ity! So unmerited! How &s;hall I dare to meet the injured angel, whom I have &s;o ba&s;ely&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="037753_0174_100F298A7078FF20">
"Of that we mu&s;t not now conver&s;e," &s;aid Helga. "Pardon me, Sir, you have too often &s;acrificed the pre&s;ent to the future. Do you un|der&s;tand and approve of Ildegerte's letter?"</P>
<P>"Perfectly," an&s;wered he, "and will follow her directions punctually."</P>
<P>"Then I have fulfilled my errand," rejoined Helga. "Farewell!"</P>
<P>"But another word," cried the King.&mdash;"How happens this? How did my di&s;tre&s;&s;es reach her ear!"</P>
<P>"Our enemy was &s;o kind," returned &s;he, "as to honour us with a confidence, which we might have expected from you. But, to be brief, (for my time is &s;hort) your worthy kin&s;man, Prince Harold, had for &s;ome time ca&s;t an eye of affection upon Ildegerte, and having it in his power to add to the allurements of his per&s;on, the allurements of a throne, (whether acquired by birth or u&s;ur|pation is to him alike) he ventured (unhappily for him rather too &s;oon) to make a formal offer of his hand by emba&s;&s;y. What followed is ea&s;ily divined. The worthy amba&s;&s;adors were confined, that the u&s;urper might remain in a &s;tate of uncertainty; a &s;mall army was ha&s;tily collected; a favourable

breeze wafted us acro&s;s the &s;ea, and here we are with you to conquer or to die."</P>
<P>The good King could not check his tears, or bear this &s;udden change of fortune.</P>
<P>"Tell her," cried he, "that &s;he has &s;aved an ungrateful wretch from death and infamy, that this cup of poi&s;on had already touched my lips."</P>
<P>He was &s;till &s;obbing and moaning to Helga, long after &s;he had left the tent.&mdash;She &s;tole with her ba&s;ket through the ho&s;tile camp, mounted the nim|ble &s;teed that awaited her among the thickets, and ha&s;tened to Ildegerte, who, in the meantime, had advanced a day's march at the head of her Norwe|gians. The re-animated King immediately convened the leaders of his little army, and announced to them the joyful news, which quickly &s;pread from tent to tent, appea&s;ing hunger and di&s;affection, in|&s;piring every heart with courage, every arm with &s;trength, every brea&s;t with loyalty, and every eye with martial fire. "Ildegerte!" was the general cry. A cheerful bu&s;tle pervaded the camp. Hel|mets were poli&s;hed, &s;words were &s;harpened, and hymns of victory &s;ung by anticipation. Upon the &s;ummit of the neighbouring mountain a centinel was &s;tationed, to &s;trike his &s;hield thrice as &s;oon as he e&s;pied the approaching army. Every one wi&s;hed
<PB N="76" REF="037753_0176_100F298E2603F6D0">
to relieve this guard, for every one was eager to announce the happy tidings.</P>
<P>Harold heard with a&s;toni&s;hment the &s;houts of joy in the valley, from whence the air till now had wafted to him naught but groans. A &s;py came to acquaint him with the threatened &s;troke. He was furious, and re&s;olved at break of the &s;ucceeding morning, to &s;torm the narrow valley, and de&s;troy the paltry band, that when Ildegerte came, &s;he might find the work already fini&s;hed, and return di&s;appointed to the woods of Norway. He re|&s;olved&mdash;but the Gods had otherwi&s;e re&s;olved.</P>
<P>The &s;un declined, and his fir&s;t beams already ki&s;&s;ed the ocean, when the guard upon the moun|tain thrice &s;truck his &s;hield. Every one climbed to the &s;ummit, and with &s;ilent rapture &s;aw the nu|merous troops emerge from a cloud of du&s;t, &s;pread in thick ranks acro&s;s the plain, and pitch their tents at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the tyrant's camp.</P>
<P>Harold foamed with rage, and vowed the death of the audacious woman. 'Twas not fear that cau&s;ed him thus to knit his brow, to fix his eye upon the earth, the gna&s;h his teeth, and clench his fi&s;t. What had Harold to fear? Ildegerte's army, joined to Theodoric's weak exhau&s;ted band, equal|led not half his force, and half of Ildegerte's fol|lowers
<PB N="77" REF="037753_0177_100F299109F74500">
were women. Fear it was not, but his de|&s;pi&s;ed affection, which converted his de&s;ire to de|te&s;tation, drove his boiling blood into his head, and forced from him an oath to exterminate the daring creature, together with her beardle&s;s train.</P>
<P>With eyes that darted fire, he left his tent to prepare his troops for battle on the en&s;uing morn|ing. But alas! what a &s;udden change! Shallow blockhead! Could&s;t thou think the name of Ilde|gerte was forgotten by the Danes?</P>
<P>"Who are they that approach?" &s;aid one to another. "Are they friends or foes?"</P>
<P>Soon was it proclaimed:</P>
<P>"'Tis Ildegerte, our Queen, the valiant noble being! Who dares to lift his hand again&s;t her? If &s;he defends Theodoric, Theodoric is right, and we are rebels.&mdash;Away to her feet! Let us appea&s;e the heroine's wrath by voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>And &s;ee! Here and there a troop for&s;ook its leader. The de&s;erters every moment increa&s;ed; every moment increa&s;ed the &s;houts of</P>
<P>"Long live Queen Ildegerte!"</P>
<P>One dragged away another; hundreds followed without knowing why or whither. They plucked green branches from the trees as a token of pacific di&s;po&s;ition, laid their arms at the feet of Ildegerte's
<PB N="78" REF="037753_0178_100F299325142C18">
guard (which at fir&s;t attempted to oppo&s;e them) crowded with acclamations to the camp, and de|manded a &s;ight of the Queen.</P>
<P>Ildegerte i&s;&s;ued from her tent with an air of ma|je&s;tic dignity. The multitude fell upon their knees, ble&s;&s;ed their Queen, and &s;ued for pardon. The heroine waved her hand. A death-like &s;ilence reigned throughout the a&s;&s;embly, and anxious ex|pectation &s;at upon every countenance.</P>
<P>"I thank you," &s;aid &s;he, "for this mark of your attachment. My heart feels its value, and, as a female, I may be allowed without re&s;traint to &s;hed the tear which you &s;ee trembling in my eye. But I have nothing to forgive. 'Tis your King whom you have injured; 'tis your King, at who&s;e feet you mu&s;t try by &s;upplication to avert the &s;word of Ju&s;tice. All I can promi&s;e is, to join my prayers to your's. Go, unite your&s;elves to my followers, and wait with re&s;ignation the approach|ing morn. The ri&s;ing &s;un will di&s;pel the enchant|ment which till now has bound your &s;en&s;es."</P>
<P>She cea&s;ed, and the &s;till increa&s;ing multitude re&s;pectfully obeyed her words. The camp was too &s;mall to contain all that arrived. They pa&s;&s;ed the night beneath the &s;tarry heavens, anxiou&s;ly &s;igh|ing for the break of day.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="037753_0179_100F2994B30FABA8">
The &s;un ro&s;e, and Ildegerte in vain looked for an enemy. Notwith&s;tanding Harold's furious me|naces, notwith&s;tanding the examples of a hundred, whom he with his own hand &s;lew, as they were flying, his mighty army every in&s;tant le&s;&s;ened. When he turned to the left, the right wing fled, and while in pur&s;uit of this, the left for&s;ook him. At la&s;t he remained alone and in de&s;pair. Too da&s;tardly to throw him&s;elf upon his &s;word, he e&s;caped through the darkne&s;s of night to the &s;ea|&s;hore, embarked on board a fi&s;herman's &s;kiff, fled to Germany, and in &s;ome mi&s;erable hamlet hid his di&s;grace and remor&s;e. No one pur&s;ued him. In a few years, exhau&s;ted by the horrors of con&s;cience, he de&s;cended to the horrors of Niflheim.</P>
<P>Ildegerte mournfully returned thanks to the God of war for the victory obtained without a blow, and was informed, as &s;he departed from the altar, of Theodoric's near approach, who, with his band of faithful followers, had already left the valley, and was coming towards her through the enemy's de&s;erted camp. She ha&s;tened to receive him.</P>
<P>But what Divinity in&s;pires me to de&s;cribe this meeting? Theodoric &s;prung from his charger, threw him&s;elf at Ildegerte's feet, and writhed in the du&s;t. He was bathed in tears, and his &s;obs
<PB N="80" REF="037753_0180_100F2996CC7CAF90">
choked his utterance.&mdash;Ildegerte rai&s;ed him, and in a gentle voice be&s;ought him to forget the pa&s;t, and to forgive the rebels. She conducted him into her pavilion, to hide from the gazing multitude the confu&s;ion of their Monarch.</P>
<P>What a triumph for the bani&s;hed Queen, to re|place a crown upon the head of her ungrateful hu&s;band, to make him feel, in &s;pite of his inju&s;tice, how great was her influence in the hearts of his &s;ubjects!</P>
<P>Joyfully the army now approached the metropo|lis. All the gates were open to receive them&mdash;every heart beat friendly towards them. Luitgar|dis was relea&s;ed, affectionately embraced by Ilde|gerte, and mortified by no reproach, or &s;cornful look. Ea&s;y it is to imagine the perplexity of poor Theodoric. He loved Ildegerte more than ever. The army adored her; the heart of every Dane was her's; the whole Court hung with reverence upon her looks: The idea of her being mother to a guitle&s;s child, dive&s;ted of his rights, added an affecting portion of compa&s;&s;ion to re&s;pect and love.&mdash;No one doubted, after all &s;he had done for the nation, that &s;he would demand, and receive the mo&s;t honourable re&s;toration to the dignities of which &s;he had unju&s;tly been deprived. The King
<PB N="81" REF="037753_0181_100F299999957FE0">
was willing from his heart to make reparation for his crime, and Luitgardis, (though &s;he trembled at the thought) could not deny that Ildegerte was worthy of the preference. In this &s;urmi&s;e the na|tion was confirmed, when Ildegerte &s;ummoned an a&s;&s;embly of all the e&s;tates, for the purpo&s;e of pub|licly addre&s;&s;ing them. The day was fixed for this &s;olemnity, and awaited with anxious curio&s;ity by every Dane. During the intervening period, va|rious were the opinions of the points which were to be the &s;ubject of the Queen's harrangue.</P>
<P>If you wi&s;h to be a witne&s;s, reader, of this &s;o|lemn &s;cene, follow me. I will conduct you to a hill, from whence you may &s;urvey the whole.</P>
<P>The morning dawned. The beams of the ri&s;ing &s;un &s;hed a cheerful lu&s;tre on the plain, which, decked with innumerable flowers, &s;tretched to an immea&s;urable di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Look! There, where the far horizon cheats the &s;ight with a dark-blue &s;hade, there ri&s;es to the clouds a towering wood of firs. To the right, a rivulet glides &s;oftly over the pebbles, in who&s;e murmuring waves ten thou&s;and diamonds &s;eem to &s;parkle. To the left ri&s;es a mountain awfully ma|je&s;tic, who&s;e &s;ummit oft is crowned with clouds, and which oft derides the thunder roaring at its

ba&s;e. To-day, however, it is clear, and bears the altar, from which the curling &s;moke &s;pires into the air. The prie&s;t, who, on his knees, with &s;acred hand is nouri&s;hing the flame, &s;eems at that height a dwarf.</P>
<P>But what thus glitters like the &s;un, in the cen|tre of the plain? What dazzling mixture this, of gold and gorgeous colours?</P>
<P>'Tis the King's throne, to which are five &s;teps, covered with &s;carlet &s;ilk. The hangings are of embroidered gold, which, drawn at the &s;ides into fe&s;toons, di&s;play the lofty ivory &s;eat ingeniou&s;ly worked. There lies upon a &s;atin cu&s;hion the re|&s;plendent crown, &s;tudded with precious &s;tones; near it the golden &s;ceptre. A hundred feathers, purple, white, and pearl-coloured, nod from the canopy with gentle motion to the &s;eat.</P>
<P>But what thus glitters like the moon on each &s;ide of the throne?</P>
<P>The thrones of the two Queens, to which are three &s;teps covered with blue &s;ilk. The &s;eats are &s;maller, gilt, and carved in divers places. The canopies are of embroidered &s;ilver, upon which a plume of blue feathers here and there is wafted by the zephyrs.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="037753_0183_100F299D79FB8D38">
But, what the&s;e di&s;tant warlike &s;ounds that &s;trike the ear?</P>
<P>They are the drums and horns, the flutes, the cymbals, and the trumpets (which with a &s;olemn march precede the grand proce&s;&s;ion), mixed with the people's &s;houts, who pre&s;s round the King's triumphal carriage. At his right hand fits, with burni&s;hed armour, and with open helm, the hero|ine Ildegerte. Upon her brow reigns the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of mighty deeds, and in her looks glows a maje&s;tic dignity. At his left hand &s;its, in the &s;now-white robe of innocence, the gentle Luitgardis, with dejected mien and prophetic dread of her fu|ture de&s;tiny. See what innumerable multitudes ru&s;h through the gates! See how they &s;pread along the road, crowd to the carriage, cut the traces, and drag, with &s;houts of joy, their much-loved burden.</P>
<P>The magnificent proce&s;&s;ion now approaches. Fir&s;t come, with drawn &s;words, &s;ix thou&s;and Amazons, headed by the faithful Helga, who nim|bly &s;eparate, and &s;urround their Monarch's throne. They are followed by the triumphal mu&s;cle-formed carriage, bearing the royal group,<NOTE N="6">Literally the royal trefoil.</NOTE> attended by trabants, men, women, and children. Now come the nobles of the land, the e&s;tates of Denmark and
<PB N="84" REF="037753_0184_100F44E581AC44B8">
of Norway, the Knights, the Leaders, and the Senators. Each heads, according to his dignity or wealth, a larger or &s;maller troop of warlike va&s;|&s;als, '&s;quires, armour-bearers, attendants. The train is endle&s;s.</P>
<P>But &s;ee! The King has already mounted his throne. Ildegerte has taken the &s;eat on his right, and Luitgardis on his left. The different e&s;tates of the kingdom occupy the &s;teps of the thrones.</P>
<P>Four heralds blow the trumpet, and command re&s;pectful &s;ilence. In&s;tantly all is &s;till as if a God had deprived a million of exi&s;tence. No one dares to breathe, or quit the place, where Chance has fixed him. Tho&s;e who are behind, ri&s;e on the tip-toe, &s;taring with eager looks over the heads and &s;houlders of the crowd before them.</P>
<P>Then aro&s;e Ildegerte from her &s;eat with lofty dignity, and thus addre&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly:&mdash;</P>
<P>"Mighty King of Denmark and Norway, my lord and hu&s;band&mdash;ye nobles of the realm and countle&s;s multitude, who&s;e looks hang on my words with anxious expectation, think not that, by my petition and Theodoric's command, you are a&s;&s;em|bled here to witne&s;s any deed which will le&s;&s;en the value of my heart. The unmerited affliction which I have endured, has neither damped my &s;pirit, nor

dimini&s;hed the upright &s;en&s;ations of my &s;oul. Far be it from Ildegerte, therefore, to &s;eek the re|&s;toration of her happine&s;s in the mi&s;ery of the in|nocent. I come not to require that &s;tation, which the King's affection once be&s;towed upon me. His will and your's have deemed it expedient, for the welfare of the &s;tate, to unite the Northern king|doms by this gentle tie, thereby to avert blood&s;hed and divi&s;ion. I revere your wi&s;dom, I wi&s;h not to cloud the fountains of private peace and unanimi|ty, who&s;e waters fertilize the&s;e realms. I acknow|ledge Luitgardis not to be my Queen, but your's. May &s;he love Theodoric as I loved, as I &s;till love him! Ildegerte will be her &s;i&s;ter, not her rival. For my&s;elf therefore I have nothing to beg. Beg, did I &s;ay? Ildegerte never begs; for what the mo&s;t holy laws of heaven and earth allot to her, &s;he demands. I demand of you, ye e&s;tates of both the kingdoms, that you re&s;tore to the child what your King has wre&s;ted from the mother, that my &s;on never may have cau&s;e to recollect my bani&s;hment. Acknow|ledge loudly and openly&mdash;Prince Haldan is Theo|doric's elde&s;t &s;on."</P>
<P>"He is! he is!" re&s;ounded from all &s;ides.</P>
<P>"Speak then!" continued &s;he; "Where is he to look for his inheritance&punc;"</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="037753_0186_100F44EA58949270">
"He is heir to both the kingdoms," cried the people.</P>
<P>"I thank you," &s;aid Ildegerte. "And you, Theodoric," proceeded &s;he, &s;inking on one knee, "do you &s;anction what your e&s;tates &s;o loudly de|cree?"</P>
<P>The good King, (who, to-day, was literally but the &s;hadow of a King, and who, to&s;&s;ing on his ivory throne from &s;ide to &s;ide, read in the looks of his &s;ubjects that they thought him but a man, who knew not the difference between gold and &s;il|ver) &s;tooped blu&s;hing to the heroine, and rai&s;ed her in his arms.</P>
<P>"Am I not obliged to you," &s;aid he, "for this my crown, this my &s;ceptre, and the happie&s;t hours of my exi&s;tence? Is not your &s;on al&s;o mine? Do you a&s;k a &s;inner this only to confu&s;e him?"</P>
<P>"Enough!" cried Ildegerte. "Now mode&s;t Lu|itgardis, your con&s;ent alone is wanting."</P>
<P>The gentle being, from who&s;e mild blue eyes the tears had long been falling on her throbbing bo&s;om, ro&s;e, and threw her&s;elf at Ildegerte's feet.</P>
<P>"Oh inimitable woman! allow me to attempt a copy of your virtues. Take back the place from which I innocently drove you&mdash;it belongs to you
<PB N="87" REF="037753_0187_100F44EBE30AFE38">
alone. Let me in retirement merit but the title of your friend."</P>
<P>"Not &s;o," rejoined the heroine. "You are the Queen, you are and &s;hall remain &s;o. As a wife, I have renounced every claim; I have only &s;poken as a mother, that my &s;on, by being interwoven in my de&s;tiny, might not cur&s;e my weakne&s;s. I &s;tand here to open the gates of honour, which have been &s;hut to him by my di&s;grace. Declare!"</P>
<P>Luitgardis turned to the crowd.</P>
<P>"Li&s;ten to me, Oh ye people! Let my weak voice reach your ears. And thou, all-&s;eeing Vara, godde&s;s of pure vows, avenger of perjury, thee do I call to witne&s;s, that I here acknowledge Prince Haldan to be the only lawful heir to both the North|ern crowns; and &s;hould Siofna ble&s;s my bed, cur&s;ed be the child who wantonly dares to break his mother's oath!"</P>
<P>A murmur of applau&s;e pervaded the multitude.</P>
<P>"Have you," demanded Ildegerte, "well con|&s;idered the nature of this oath? Do you know the force of maternal love? What will you leave your children?"</P>
<P>"A grateful heart," &s;aid &s;he. "Will they not even be obliged to you for their exi&s;tence?"</P>
<P>"Good woman," cried the heroine, "you
<PB N="88" REF="037753_0188_100F44EF38913B50">
de&s;erve more than it is in my power to give. To rob your children of both crowns, in order to place them on the head of mine, were no longer maternal love, but rather an unbridled lu&s;t of pow|er. Heaven grant my &s;on &s;trength to bear but one, as may become an upright Monarch! 'Tis the diadem of Norway I demand for him; let Denmark's &s;ceptre remain in the hands of your children."</P>
<P>This conte&s;t between two virtuous &s;ouls drew tears from a million eyes. Ildegerte and Luitgar|dis were alternate objects of love and admiration. Every one wi&s;hed to give all to both, for both de|&s;erved more than all that could be given. But as Ildegerte in&s;i&s;ted on the generous renunciation of the Dani&s;h crown, the e&s;tates of both kingdoms unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved that Prince Haldan be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed and henceforth con&s;idered King of Norway, and in ca&s;e of the royal i&s;&s;ue being extinct in ei|ther of the kingdoms, that the crown devolve upon the neighbouring Monarch.</P>
<P>Ildegerte had required nothing for her&s;elf; but every heart leaned towards her, and wi&s;hed to ex|tingui&s;h in her bo&s;om the remembrance of her un|de&s;erved afflictions.&mdash;Ildegerte (thus decreed the e&s;tates) &s;hall bear, during her life, the title of

Queen of Norway, and deliverer of Denmark. She &s;hall take her &s;tation upon fe&s;tivals at the King's right hand. She &s;hall reign in Norway, during the minority of her &s;on, as &s;he reigns in the hearts of its inhabitants, and a monument of bra&s;s &s;hall record her deeds to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>In the heroine's eye quivered a tear of bli&s;s. She bowed to the multitude, and a thou&s;and voices rai&s;ed her name with joyful &s;houts to the habita|tion of the Gods.</P>
<P>Loud &s;ounded the trumpets, cymbals, drums, and horns, but louder the glad cry of</P>
<P>"Long live Queen Ildegerte!"</P>
<P>A happy banquet followed the &s;olemnities. In a thou&s;and decorated tents the teeming horn went round. The gay couples winded through the ma|zy dance, and the ri&s;ing &s;un beheld the intoxicated &s;lumberers &s;tretched upon the dewy gra&s;s.</P>
<P>But already does maternal love hurry Ildegerte to the &s;trand; already does the &s;hip unmoor which is to bear the heroine to her native &s;hores. But another embrace, another parting tear, another &s;ad adieu, and&mdash;the rowers da&s;h through the foaming waves, the pendants wanton in the air, a fre&s;h breeze &s;wells the canva&s;s, and already is the coa&s;t hidden in the mi&s;t. All is now lo&s;t, except the
<PB N="90" REF="037753_0190_100F44F3B1158958">
loud ble&s;&s;ings of the affected multitude, which are borne upon the wings of the wind to Ildegerte's ear.</P>
<P>NO more has my feeble pen to relate of this illu&s;trious heroine. She was a Thora, and tried to make her &s;on a Swend. But that &s;he was not immortal, and that, weary of life, &s;he too at la&s;t &s;lept in the arms of Hela, is betrayed by the cy|pre&s;s, which hangs on the lyre of her Scald.</P>

will be as u&s;eful as a prolix one. If objection be made to the morality of the leading Incident, it mu&s;t be allow|ed al&s;o, that all po&s;&s;ible care is taken to &s;olve and recon|cile it by the noblene&s;s of mind, purity and con&s;tancy of the per&s;ons concerned, and the delicate manner in which their adventure is developed, and their happine&s;s &s;ecured. It is with real plea&s;ure that we peru&s;e and recommend a Novel of this &s;tamp; but it happens, like other good things, very rarely.</Q></P>
