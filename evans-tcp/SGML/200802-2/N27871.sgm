<HEAD>THE Two Wealthy Farmers, &amp;c. PART V.</HEAD>
<P>O Mr. Worthy, &s;aid Bragwell, this blow is too heavy for me, I cannot &s;urvive this &s;hock. I do not de&s;ire it, I only de&s;ire to die. We are very apt to talk mo&s;t of dying when we are lea&s;t fit for it, &s;aid Worthy. This is not the lan|guage of that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which makes us prepare for death, but of that de&s;pair which makes us out of humour with life. O, Mr. Bragwell, you are indeed di&s;appoin|ted of the grand ends which made life &s;o delightful to you; but till your heart is humbled, till you are brought to a &s;erious conviction of &s;in, till you are brought to &s;ee what is the true end of life, you can have no hope in death. You think you have no bu&s;ine&s;s on earth, becau&s;e tho&s;e for who&s;e &s;ake you too eagerly heaped up riches are no more. But is there not un|der the canopy of heaven &s;ome afflicted being whom you may yet relieve, &s;ome mode&s;t merit which you may bring forward, &s;ome helple&s;s creature you may &s;ave by your advice, &s;ome peri&s;hing chri&s;tian you may &s;u&s;tain by your wealth? When you have
<PB N="3" REF="037136_0003_100C83512887E678">
no &s;ins of your own to repent of, no mer|cies of God to be thankful for, no mi&s;eries of others to relieve, then, and not till then, I con&s;ent you &s;hould &s;ink down in de&s;pair, and call on death to relieve you.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy attended his afflicted friend to the funeral of his unhappy daugh|ter and her babe. The &s;olemn &s;ervice, the committing his late gay and beautiful daughter to darkne&s;s, to worms, and to corruption, the &s;ight of the dead infant, for who&s;e &s;ake he had re&s;umed all his &s;chemes of vanity and covetou&s;ne&s;s, when he thought he had got the better of them, the melancholy conviction that all human pro&s;perity ends in <HI>ashes to ashes and dust to dust,</HI> had brought down Mr. Bragwell's &s;elf-&s;ufficient and haughty &s;oul into &s;omething of that humble frame in which Mr. Worthy had wi&s;hed to &s;ee it. As &s;oon as they returned home he was be|ginning to &s;eize the favourable moment for fixing the&s;e &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions, when they were un&s;ea&s;onably interrupted by the pari&s;h officer, who came to a&s;k Mr. Bragwell what he was to do with a poor dying woman who was travelling the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oun|try with her child, and was taken in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t

under the church-yard wall? At fir&s;t they thought &s;he was dead, &s;aid the man, but finding &s;he &s;till breathed, they have carried her into the workhou&s;e till &s;he could give &s;ome account of her&s;elf. Mr. Bragwell was impatient at the interrup|tion, which was indeed un&s;ea&s;onable, and told the man he was at that time too much overcome by &s;orrow to attend to bu&s;ine&s;s, but he would give him an an&s;wer to-mor|row. But my friend, &s;aid Mr. Worthy, the poor woman may die to-night; your mind is indeed not in a frame for worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, but there is no &s;orrow too great to forbid our attending on the calls of du|ty. An act of chri&s;tian charity will not di&s;turb but improve the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of your &s;pirit, and though you cannot dry your own tears, God may, in great mer|cy, permit you to dry tho&s;e of another. This may be one of tho&s;e occa&s;ions for which I told you life was worth keeping. Do let us &s;ee this woman. Bragwell was not in a &s;tate either to con&s;ent or refu&s;e, and his friend drew him to the workhou&s;e, about the door of which &s;tood a crowd of people. She is not dead, &s;aid one, &s;he moves her head. But &s;he wants air, &s;aid they all, while they all, according to cu&s;|tom,
<PB N="5" REF="037136_0005_100C8356CDFC0078">
pu&s;hed &s;o clo&s;e upon her that it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould get any. A fine boy of two or three years old &s;tood by her, cry|ing, Mammy is dead, mammy is &s;tarved. Mr. Worthy made up to the poor woman, holding his friend by the arm: in order to give her air he untied a large black bon|net which hid her face, when Mr. Brag|well, at that moment ca&s;ting his eyes on her, &s;aw in this poor &s;tranger the face of his own run-away daughter, Mrs. Incle. He groaned, but could not &s;peak, and as he was turning away to conceal his an|gui&s;h, the little boy fondly caught hold of his hand, li&s;ping out&mdash;O &s;tay, and give mammy &s;ome bread. His heart yearned towards the child, he gra&s;ped his little hand in his, while he &s;orrowfully &s;aid to Mr. Worthy, it is too much, &s;end away the people. It is my dear naughty child, <HI>my punishment is greater than I can bear.</HI> Mr. Worthy de&s;ired the people to go and leave the &s;tranger to them; but by this time &s;he was no &s;tranger to any of them. Pale and meagre as was her face, and poor and &s;habby as was her dre&s;s, the proud and flaunting Mi&s;s Polly Bragwell was ea&s;ily known by every one pre&s;ent. They went away with the mean revenge
<PB N="6" REF="037136_0006_100C83585AB5D460">
of little minds, they paid them&s;elves by abu&s;e, for all the airs and in&s;olence they had once endured from her. Pride mu&s;t have a fall, &s;aid one. I remember when &s;he was too good to &s;peak to a poor body, &s;aid another; where are her flounces and her furbelows now? It is come home to her at la&s;t. Her child looks as if he would be glad of the wor&s;t bit &s;he former|ly denied us.</P>
<P>In the mean time Mr, Bragwell had &s;unk in an old wicker chair which &s;tood behind, and groaned out, Lord forgive my hard heart! Lord &s;ubdue my proud heart, "create a clean heart, O God and renew a right &s;pirit within me." This was per|haps the fir&s;t word of genuine prayer he had ever offered up in his whole life. Worthy overheard it, and his heart re|joiced, but this was not a time for talking, but doing. He a&s;ked Bragwell what was to be done with the unfortunate woman, who now &s;eemed to recover fa&s;t, but &s;he did not &s;ee them, for they were behind. She embraced her boy, and faintly &s;aid, my child what &s;hall we do? <HI>I will arise and go to my father, and say unto him, fa|ther I have sinned against heaven and be|fore

thee.</HI> This was a joyful found to Mr. Worthy, who began to hope that her heart might be as much changed for the better as her circum&s;tances were altered for the wor&s;e, and he valued the goods of fortune &s;o little, and contrition of &s;oul &s;o much, that he began to think the change on the whole might be a happy one. The boy then &s;prung from his mother and ran to Bragwell, &s;aying, Do be good to mam|my. Mrs. Incle looking round, now per|ceived her father; &s;he fell at his feet, &s;aying, O forgive your guilty child, and &s;ave your innocent one from &s;tarving. Bragwell &s;unk down by her, and prayed God to forgive both her and him&s;elf in terms of genuine &s;orrow. To hear words of real penitence and heart-felt prayer from this once high-minded father and vain daughter, was mu&s;ic to Worthy's ears, who thought this moment of out|ward mi&s;ery was the only joyful one he had ever &s;pent in the Bragwell family. He was re&s;olved not to interfere, but let the father's own feelings work out the way in which he was to act. Bragwell &s;aid nothing, but &s;lowly led to his own hou&s;e, holding the little boy by the hand, and pointing to Worthy to a&s;&s;i&s;t the feeble
<PB N="8" REF="037136_0008_100C8375B34ED788">
&s;teps of his daughter, who once more en|tered her father's door's; but the dread of &s;eeing her mother quite overpowered her. Mrs. Bragwell's heart was not changed, but &s;orrow had weakened her powers of re&s;i&s;tance, and &s;he rather &s;uffer|ed her daughter to come in, than gave her a kind reception. She was more a&s;toni&s;hed than plea&s;ed; and, even in this trying moment, was more di&s;gu&s;ted with the little boy's mean cloaths, than delighted with his ro&s;y face. As &s;oon as &s;he was a little recovered, Mr. Bragwell de&s;ired his daughter to tell him how &s;he happened to be at that place ju&s;t at that time.</P>
<P>In a weak voice &s;he began, My tale, Sir, is &s;hort, but mournful.</P>
<P>I left your hou&s;e, my dear father, &s;aid Mrs. Incle, with a heart full of vain tri|umph. I had no doubt but my hu&s;band was a great man who had put on that di&s;|gui&s;e to obtain my hand. Judge then what I felt to find that he was a needy im|po&s;tor, who wanted my money but did not care for me. This di&s;covery, though it mortified, did not humble me. I had
<PB N="9" REF="037136_0009_100C83785E119220">
neither affection to bear with the man who had deceived me, nor religion to im|prove by the di&s;appointment. I have found that change of circum&s;tances does not change the heart, till God is plea&s;ed to do it. My misfortunes only taught me to rebel more again&s;t him. I thought God unju&s;t; I accu&s;ed my father, I was envi|ous of my &s;i&s;ter, I hated my hu&s;band; but never once did I blame my&s;elf. My hu&s;|band picked up a wretched &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by joining him&s;elf to any low &s;cheme of idle plea&s;ure that was going on. He would follow a mountebank, carry a dice-box, or fiddle at a fair. He was always taunt|ing me for the gentility on which I &s;o muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> valued my&s;elf. If I had married a poor working girl, &s;aid he, &s;he could now have got her bread; but a fine lady with|out money, is a burthen to her hu&s;band and a plague to &s;ociety. Every tria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which affection might have made lighter, we doubled by animo&s;ity; at length my hu&s;band was detected in u&s;ing fal&s;e dice; he fought with his accu&s;er, both were &s;eized by a pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s-gang, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. I was now left to the wide world, and mi&s;erable as I had thought my&s;elf before&punc; I &s;oon found there were higher <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

mi&s;ery. I was near my time, without bread for my&s;elf, or hope for my child. I &s;et out on foot in &s;earch of the village where I had heard my hu&s;band &s;ay his friends lived. It was a &s;evere trial to my proud heart to &s;toop to tho&s;e low people, but hunger is not delicate, and I was near peri&s;hing. My hu&s;band's parents received me kindly, &s;aying that though they had nothing but what they earned by their labour, yet I was welcome to &s;hare their hard fare, for they tru&s;ted that God who &s;ent mouths would &s;end meat al&s;o. They gave me a &s;mall room in their cottage, and many nece&s;&s;aries, which they denied them&s;eves.</P>
<P>O, my child, interrupted Bragwell, every word cuts me to the heart. The&s;e poor people gladly gave thee of their lit|tle, while thy rich parents left thee to &s;tarve.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I own, continued Mrs. Incle, that all this goodne&s;s could not &s;often my heart, for God had not yet touched it. I received all their kindne&s;s as a favour done to them. When my father brought me home any little dainty which he could
<PB N="11" REF="037136_0011_100C837BFAA31FA8">
pick up, and my mother kindly dre&s;&s;ed it for me, I would not conde&s;cend to eat it with them, but devoured it &s;ullenly in my little garret alone, &s;uffering them to fetch and carry every thing I wanted. As my haughty behaviour was not likely to gain their affection, it was plain they did not love me: and as I had no notion that there were any other motives to good ac|tions but fondne&s;s, or &s;elf-intere&s;t, I was puzzled to know what could make them &s;o kind to me, for of the powerful and con&s;trainnig law of chri&s;tian charity I was quite ignorant. To cheat the weary hours, I looked about for &s;ome books, and found, among a few others of the &s;ame ca&s;t, <HI>Dod|dridge's Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul.</HI> But all tho&s;e books wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dre&s;&s;|ed to <HI>sinners;</HI> now as I knew I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> not a &s;inner I threw them away in d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">&s;t. Indeed they were ill &s;uited to a ta&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r|med by novels, to which reading I chiefly trace my ruin, for, vain as I was, I &s;hould never have been guilty of &s;o wild a &s;tep as to run away, had not my heart been tainted, and my imagination inflamed, by tho&s;e pernicious books.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037136_0012_100C837DA8C587D0">At length my little George was born. This added to the burthen I had brought on this poor family, but it did not dimin|i&s;h their kindne&s;s, and we continued to &s;hare their &s;canty fare without any up|braiding on their part, or any gratitude on mine. Even this poor baby did not &s;often my heart; I wept over him indeed day and night, but they were tears of de&s;|pair; I was always idle, and wa&s;ted tho&s;e hours in &s;inful murmurs at his fate, which I &s;hould have employed in trying to main|tain him. Hard&s;hip, grief, and impati|ence, at length brought on a fever. Death &s;eemed now at hand, and I felt a gloomy &s;atisfaction in the thought of being rid of my mi&s;eries, to which I fear was added, a &s;ullen joy to think that you, Sir, and my mother, would be plagued to hear of my death when it would be too late, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this your grief, I anticipated a gloomy &s;ort of revenge&punc; But it plea&s;ed my mer|ciful God not to let me thus peri&s;h in my &s;ins. My poor mother-in-law &s;ent for a good clergyman, who pointed out to me the danger of dying in that hard and un|converted &s;tate &s;o forcibly, that I &s;hudder|ed to find on what a dreadful precipice I &s;tood. He prayed with me, and for me,
<PB N="13" REF="037136_0013_100C92F1EAA68C70">
&s;o earne&s;tly, that at length God, who is &s;ometimes plea&s;ed to magnify his own glo|ry in awakening tho&s;e who are dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, was plea&s;ed, of his free grace to open my blind eyes, and &s;often my &s;tony heart. I &s;aw my&s;elf a &s;inner, and prayed to be delivered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">om the wrath of God, in compari&s;on of which the po|verty and di&s;grace I now &s;uffered appear|ed as nothing. To a &s;oul convinced of &s;in, the news of a Redeemer was a joyful &s;ound. In&s;tead of reproaching Providence, or blaming my parents, or abu&s;ing my hu&s;band, I now learnt to condemn my|&s;elf, to adore that God who had not cut me off in my ignorance, to pray for par|don for the pa&s;t, and grace for the time to come. I now de&s;ired to &s;ubmit to pen|ury and hunger in this world, &s;o that I might but live in the fear of God here, and enjoy his favour in the world to come. I now learnt to compare my pre&s;ent light &s;ufferings, the con&s;equence of my own &s;in, with tho&s;e bitter &s;ufferings of my Sa|viour which he endured for my &s;ake, and I was a&s;hamed of murmuring. But &s;elf-ignorance, conceit, and vanity, were &s;o rooted in me, that my progre&s;s was ve|ry gradual, and I had the &s;orrow to feel,
<PB N="14" REF="037136_0014_100C92F3D5604E28">
how much the power of long bad habits keeps down the growth of religion in the heart, even after it has begun to take root. I was &s;o ignorant of divine things, that I hardly knew words to frame a prayer; but when I got acquainted with the P&s;alms, I there learnt how to pour out the fullne&s;s of my heart, while in the Go&s;pel I rejoiced to &s;ee what great things God had done for my &s;oul.</P>
<P>I now took down once more from the &s;helf <HI>Doddridge's Rise and Progress,</HI> and, oh! with what new eyes did I read it! I now &s;aw clearly, that not only the thief, and the drunkard, the murderer and the adulterer, are &s;inners, for that I knew be|fore; but I found that the unbeliever, the &s;elfi&s;h, the proud, the worldly-minded, all, in &s;hort, who live without God in the world are &s;inners. I did not now apply the reproofs I met with to my hu&s;band, or my father, or other people, as I u&s;ed to do, but brought them home to my&s;elf. In this book I traced, with &s;trong emoti|ons, and clo&s;e &s;elf-application, the &s;in|ner through all his cour&s;e; his fir&s;t awa|kening, his convictions, repentance, joys, &s;orrows, back&s;liding, and recovery, de&s;|pondency,
<PB N="15" REF="037136_0015_100C92F560B30090">
and delight, to a triumphant death-bed; and God was plea&s;ed to make it a chief in&s;trument in bringing me to him&s;elf. Here it is, continued Mrs. In|cle, untying her little bundle, and taking out a book, accept it, my dear father, and I will pray that God may ble&s;s it to you as He has done to me.</P>
<P>When I was able to come down, I pa&s;&s;ed my time with the&s;e good old people, and &s;oon won their affection. I was &s;urprized to find they had very good &s;en&s;e, which I never had thought poor people could have; but, indeed, worldly per&s;ons do not know how much religion, while it mends the heart, enlightens the under|&s;tanding al&s;o. I now regretted the even|ings I had wa&s;ted in my &s;olitary garret, when I might have pa&s;&s;ed them in reading the Bible with the&s;e good folks. This was their refre&s;hing cordial after a weary day, which &s;weetened the pains of want and age. I one day expre&s;&s;ed my &s;ur|prize that my unfortunate hu&s;band, the &s;on of &s;uch pious parents, &s;hould have turned out &s;o ill: the poor old man &s;aid with tears, I fear we have been guilty of the &s;in of Eli; our love was of

the wrong &s;ort. Alas! like him, <HI>we honoured our son more than God,</HI> and God has &s;mitten us for it. We &s;hewed him what was right, but through a fal&s;e indulgence, we did not correct him for what was wrong. We were blind to his faults. He was a hand&s;ome boy, with &s;prightly parts; we took too much delight in tho&s;e outward things. He &s;oon got above our management, and became vain, idle, and extravagant, and when we &s;ought to re&s;train him, it was then too late. We humbled our|&s;elves before God; but he was plea|&s;ed to make our &s;in become its own puni&s;hment. Timothy grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e; till he was forced to ab|&s;cond for a mi&s;demeanor; after which we never &s;aw him, but have heard of him changing from one idle way of life to another, <HI>unstable as water:</HI> he has been a footman, a &s;oldier, a &s;hop|man, and a &s;trolling actor. With deep &s;orrow we trace back his vices to our ungoverned fondne&s;s; that lively and &s;harp wit, by which he has been able to carry on &s;uch a variety of wild &s;chemes, might, if we had u&s;ed him to reproof in his youth, have enabled
<PB N="17" REF="037136_0017_100C92F9DEB2FA70">
him to have done great &s;ervice for God and his country. But our flatte|ry made him wi&s;e in his own conceit and there is more hope of a fool tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of him. We indulged our own vani|ty, and have de&s;troyed his &s;oul.</P>

I made &s;ome aukward attempts to learn to &s;pin and knit, when my mother's wheel or knitting lay by, but I &s;poilt both through my ignorance. At la&s;t I luc|kily thought upon the fine netting I u&s;ed to make for my trimmings, and it &s;truck me that I might turn this to &s;ome little account.

reconciled me to this mean trade. Mr. Bragwell groaned, and bade her go on.</P>
<P>In the mean time, my little George grew a fine boy; and I adored the goodne&s;s of God, who, in the &s;weetne&s;s of maternal love, had given me a re|ward for many &s;ufferings. In&s;tead of indulging a gloomy di&s;tru&s;t about the fate of this child, I now re&s;igned him to the will of God. In&s;tead of lamenting becau&s;e he was not likely to be rich, I was re&s;olved to bring him up with &s;uch notions as might make him contented to be poor. I thought, if I could &s;ubdue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> vanity and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in him, I &s;hould make him a happier man than if I had thou&s;ands to be&s;tow on him; and I tru&s;ted, that I &s;hould be rewarded for every painful act of pre&s;ent &s;elf-denial, by the future virtue and happi|ne&s;s of my child. Can you believe it, my dear father, my days now pa&s;t not unhappily? I worked hard all day, and that alone is a &s;ource of happi|ne&s;s beyond what the idle can gue&s;s. After my child was a&s;leep at night, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d a chapter in the Bible to my pa|rents, who&s;e eyes now began to fail

them. We then thanked God over our frugal &s;upper of potatoes, and talk|ed over the holy men of old, the &s;aints, and the martyrs, who would have thought our homely fare a lux|ury. We compared our peace, and liberty, and &s;afety, with their bonds, and impri&s;onment, and tortures; and &s;hould have been a&s;hamed of a murmur. We then joined in prayer, in which my ab&s;ent parents and my hu&s;band were never forgotten, and went to re&s;t in charity with the whole world, and at peace in our own &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Oh! my forgiving child! inter|rupted Mr. Bragwell, &s;obbing, and did&s;t thou really pray for thy unnatu|ral father, and lie down in re&s;t and peace? Then let me tell thee, thou wa&s;t better off than thy mother and I were.&mdash;But no more of this; go on.</P>
<P>Whether my father-in-law had work|ed beyond his &s;trength, in order to &s;upport me and my child, I know not, but he was taken dangerou&s;ly ill, While he lay in this &s;tate, we re|ceived an account that my hu&s;band

was dead in the We&s;t-Indies of the yellow fever, which has carried off &s;uch numbers of our countrymen; we all wept together, and prayed that his awful death might quicken us in pre|paring for our own. This &s;hock, joined to the fatigue of nur&s;ing her &s;ick hu&s;band, &s;oon brought my poor mother to death's door. I nur&s;ed them both, and felt a &s;atisfaction in giving them all I had to be&s;tow, my atten|dance, my tears, and my prayers. I, who was once &s;o nice and &s;o proud, &s;o di&s;dainful in the mid&s;t of plenty, and &s;o impatient under the &s;malle&s;t inconvenience, was now enabled to glorify God by my activity and my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Though the &s;orrows of my heart were enlarged, I ca&s;t my bur|then on him who cares for the weary and the heavy laden. After having watched by the&s;e poor people the whole night, I &s;at down to breakfa&s;t on my dry cru&s;t and coar&s;e di&s;h of tea, without a murmur; my greate&s;t grief was, le&s;t I &s;hould bring away the in|fection to my dear boy. I prayed to know what it was my duty to do be|tween my dying parents, and my

helple&s;s child. To take care of the &s;ick and aged, &s;eemed to be my duty. So I offered up my child to him who is the father of the fatherle&s;s, and he &s;pared him to me.</P>
<P>The chearful piety with which the&s;e good people breathed their la&s;t, proved to me, that the temper of mind with which the pious poor commonly meet death, is a grand compen&s;ation made them by Providence for all the hard|&s;hips of their inferior condition. If they have had few joys and comforts in life already, and have &s;till fewer hopes in &s;tore, is not all fully made up to them by their being enabled to leave this world with &s;tronger de&s;ires of heaven, and without tho&s;e bitter regrets after the good things of this life, which add to the dying tortures of the worldly rich? To the forlorn and de&s;titute death is not terible, as it is to him who <HI>sits at ease in his possessions,</HI> and who fears that this night his &s;oul &s;hall be required of him.</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell felt this remark more deeply than his daughter meant he

<P>I followed my departed parents to the &s;ame grave, and wept over them, but not as one who had no hope. They had neither hou&s;es nor lands to leave me, but they left me their Bible, their ble&s;&s;ing, and their example, of which I humbly tru&s;t I &s;hall feel the benefits when all the riches of this world &s;hall have an end. Their few effects, con|&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome poor hou&s;ehold goods, and &s;ome working-tools, hardly &s;ufficed to pay their funeral expences. I was &s;oon attacked with the &s;ame fever, and &s;aw my&s;elf, as I thought, dying the &s;econd time; my danger was the &s;ame, but my views were changed.

<P>Here Mrs. Incle &s;topped. Grief, &s;hame, pride, and remor&s;e, had quite overcome Mr. Bragwell, He wept like a child; and &s;aid, he hoped his daughter would pray for him, for that he was not in a condition to pray for him&s;elf, though he found nothing el&s;e could give him any comfort.
