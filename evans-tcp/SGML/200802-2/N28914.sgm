<P>TIME, though a reality with which in our pre|&s;ent exi&s;tence we are deeply conver&s;ant, is the mo&s;t difficult to explain; and &s;ome have thought its nature &s;o extremely intricate that it is incapable of admitting any clear and explicit definition. It

is, therefore, with diffidence we enter upon this &s;ub|ject, and offer our ob&s;ervations upon it, not as u&s;urping over the rea&s;on or the religion of our readers, but with a devout wi&s;h for their in&s;truc|tion, by that Almighty Being who is the fir&s;t cau&s;e, the great and la&s;t end of all things.</P>
<P>Time is the limited or given period for the pro|duction and duration of things in natural life, ac|cording to the wi&s;e coun&s;el and &s;overeign plea&s;ure of God. The diurnal and annual revolutions of the &s;un, as having been, from the beginning of na|ture, con&s;tant, regular, and univer&s;ally ob&s;ervable by mankind, and &s;uppo&s;ed equal to one another, have been, with rea&s;on, made u&s;e of for the mea|&s;ure of &s;uch natural and animal exi&s;tence: con|&s;equently, we find that time has been divided into centuries, years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, &s;econds, &amp;c. and by the&s;e the larger and le&s;s intervals of time are e&s;timated and mea&s;ured. Whatever is without time has no &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and whatever is in time, is &s;ubject to changes. Time, therefore, con&s;i&s;ts of three parts&mdash;the <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> which enjoys exi&s;tence; the <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> which has lo&s;t it; the <HI>future,</HI> which is to obtain it. The light of nature, I pre&s;ume, may teach us, that time is a <HI>creature;</HI> or, in other words, is given out and de&s;igned by the Supreme Maje&s;ty; becau&s;e it is in a perpetual
<PB N="3" REF="038552_0004_10122A86A49E8AD0">
flux, produces the will of him who reigns above all, and is it&s;elf peri&s;hing in its own ruins, dragging with it the fate of kingdoms in &s;pite of human op|po&s;ition. Some, therefore, have called time a drop taken out of the va&s;t ocean of eternity, and which &s;hall return into its own bo&s;om; that it is an intermediate &s;pace, a prelude to an infinite expan&s;ion, boundle&s;s and never ending. Mr. Locke &s;ays, "the general idea we have of time, is by con&s;idering any part of infinite duration, as &s;et out by periodical mea&s;ures." The being or exi&s;t|ence of time is obvious to all; and although a phi|lo&s;ophical &s;earch after its origin, nature, and pe|riods, be commendable in the penetrating genius, yet its improvement for our moral happine&s;s mu&s;t certainly meet the highe&s;t commendation, and be more intere&s;ting to all; and, from this conviction, numberle&s;s volumes have been written upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>However uncertain the &s;entiments of philo&s;ophy upon the &s;ubject of time, let us now take up our BIBLE and &s;ee if we cannot tread upon more &s;olid ground, and derive more plea&s;ure in our in|quiries.</P>
<P>I. This ine&s;timable volume, the bible, directs our inquiries to Jehovah, as the ANCIENT OF DAYS, Daniel vii. that is, the author of <HI>time,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="038552_0005_1012582362797C38">
and the parent of <HI>eternity;</HI> who was before all things, by whom and for whom all things were made; and which, in the new te&s;tament, is applied to Je&s;us Chri&s;t in his divinity, who is God over all, ble&s;&s;ed forever, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t. Rev. i. 8.</P>
<P>Time, though now grown old, bears not its own date; neither informs us of its de&s;igned period; but the &s;criptures in&s;truct us of the formation of the univer&s;e, when time, with human beings, com|menced; the divi&s;ions of time by day and night, and what we call its weekly round; likewi&s;e of the period when the angel &s;hall &s;tand upon the earth and up|on the &s;ea, lift up his hand to heaven, and &s;wear by him that liveth forever and ever, that there &s;hould be time no longer. Rev. x. 5, 6. There|fore, in point of antiquity, the bible claims our devout e&s;teem. This volume al&s;o gives us the complete&s;t hi&s;tory of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time, as to the being and the vici&s;&s;itudes of a va&s;t number of the inhabitants of the earth, as formed into families, cities, and empires; the greater part of which were the &s;ubject of previous prophecy; and which, in their time, were fulfilled, not one failed; an in|ve&s;tigation of which gives us a &s;olid evidence of the authenticity of the &s;cripture. Tho&s;e who have been mo&s;t conver&s;ant with the bible, have ob&s;erved that the duration of time is marked with &s;even pe|riods,
<PB N="5" REF="038552_0006_10125825DBA2B500">
or thou&s;and years; two from the creation to the flood, two to the birth of Chri&s;t, two for the go&s;pel aera, now in being, making &s;ix thou&s;and years; to which is added, one thou&s;and for the per&s;onal reign of Chri&s;t, called the Millennium: in the whole, &s;even thou&s;and years; corre&s;ponding with the &s;ix fir&s;t days of creation, and the &s;abbath, or &s;eventh, the day of re&s;t; for <HI>a thou&s;and years are with the Lord as one day.</HI></P>
<P>II. Let us now contemplate time as the limited &s;pace of man's natural exi&s;tence. To every thing there is a &s;ea&s;on, and a time to every purpo&s;e un|der heaven; a time to be born, and a time to die. Eccl. iii. 1, 2. Man cometh not into being by ac|cidental circum&s;tances, or by what &s;ome call chance, but according to the fore-knowledge and infinite plea&s;ure of God, who declareth the end from the beginning, and who worketh all things after the coun&s;el of his own will. David, in lan|guage mo&s;t &s;ublime, acknowledges God the au|thor of his exi&s;tence:&mdash;<HI>Thine eyes did &s;ee my &s;ub|&s;tance, yet being unperfect: and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fa&s;hioned, when as yet there was none of them.</HI> P&s;m. cxxxix. 16. And in contemplation on the human &s;tructure, we may unite with Dr. Lowth&mdash;

<L>With awful joy I view this frame of mine,</L>
<L>Stupendous monument of power divine!</L></Q></P>
<P>Our clime, parents, birth, parts, pa&s;&s;ions, time, place, and circum&s;tances of our introduction to natural life, infancy, youth, manhood, old age, death, with all their variety of appendages and events, in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ive periods, are ordered by that God <HI>in whom we live, move, and have our being.</HI> Acts xvii. 28. Or, as Cowper admirably de&s;cribes it&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;God gives to every man</L>
<L>The virtue, temper, understanding, taste,</L>
<L>That lifts him into life, and lets him fall</L>
<L>Just in the niche he was ordained to fill.</L></Q></P>
<P>We are not long introduced to life before we learn that time, like a va&s;t confluence of waters, takes its ri&s;e from eternity; rapidly returns to the unbounded &s;ource from whence it came, bearing on its bo&s;om the myriads of the human race. We learn too, that none can &s;tem the current, nor for a moment divide its &s;tream; it is, indeed, vi&s;ible to all as we pa&s;s along, we date its ri&s;e with us, but <HI>none knoweth what a day may bring forth,</HI> nor a&s;certain when the &s;olemn period of our time &s;hall be turned by the hand of death. In youth we are prone to view our future time as a va&s;t expan&s;e;

in manhood, by more confirmed worldly habits, we call our moments our own; though frequently they elude our touch, and either cut &s;hort the thread of life, or imperceptibly bring us to old age. May we not &s;ay with David, <HI>Lord remember how &s;hort my time is!</HI> P&s;m. lxxxix. 47. <HI>Our days on earth are as a &s;hadow, and there is none abiding;</HI> 1 Chron. xxix. 15. a <HI>vapor,</HI> that in an in&s;tant is no more &s;een! James iv. 14. The longe&s;t life, in the review, is but as ye&s;terday; and its various occurrences are as a tale that is told: Yet, every fleeting moment and revolving year are graduated by the hand of Almighty God, upon the &s;cale of human being, and each &s;hall an&s;wer his intended end.</P>
<P>III. The tran&s;actions of human beings &s;urvive the wreck of time, and pa&s;s into eternity; a thought, this, which &s;hould fall with &s;olemn weight upon every brea&s;t. God's univer&s;al government, the un|equal di&s;tribution of rewards and puni&s;hments in this life, the &s;oul's con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of virtue and of vice, the egre&s;s of the mind towards a future &s;tate, man's departure out of time by death again&s;t his own will; the&s;e, with many other inconte&s;table truths, form the foundation of our confidence, that the tran&s;actions of mankind, in time, are amenable to a future &s;tate of retribution; and, in which,

the honours of God, in his law and ju&s;tice, &s;hall be revealed in pre&s;ence of men and angels. On the&s;e mo&s;t &s;olemn and intere&s;ting &s;ubjects the &s;crip|tures give us the highe&s;t in&s;truction; they make a con&s;iderable part of their ample page. Verily there is a God that judgeth the earth. P&s;m. lviii. 11. We mu&s;t all appear before the judgment &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at of Chri&s;t, that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. 2 Cor. v. 10. The Lord look|ed down from heaven upon the children of men, to &s;ee if there were any that did under&s;tand and &s;eek God. They are all gone a&s;ide, they are al|together become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. P&s;m. xiv. Every idle word that man &s;hall &s;peak, he &s;hall give account thereof in the day of judgment. Matt. xxxvi. The dead, &s;mall and great, &s;hall &s;tand before God; the &s;ea, death and hell, &s;hall deliver up their dead to be judged, every man according to his works. Rev. xx This de&s;cription of the &s;tate of man, and of future retribution, is con&s;onant to &s;ound rea&s;on; a con|viction of which mu&s;t exi&s;t in every con&s;cious brea&s;t. How dreary then the pro&s;pect of human nature! On the rapid &s;tream of time, e&s;teeming the precious moments of exi&s;tence as the mo&s;t trifling commodity though more valuable than

Every moment brings the &s;inner nearer to his final end; the &s;trong current of time ha&s;tening him to death, who &s;hall whirl the &s;oul down the awful precipice from whence he can only ri&s;e to &s;tand before the judge of all, and receive his final doom.

<P>IV. It is therefore with the highe&s;t plea&s;ure we reflect on time as the &s;pace in which the purpo&s;es of God are unfolded in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as willing and mighty to redeem lo&s;t &s;inners as they were low &s;unk in wretchedne&s;s and ruin. This mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour was promi&s;ed immediately after the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of our fir&s;t parents in Paradi&s;e, and revealed as the &s;eed of the woman who was to brui&s;e the &s;er|pent's head. Gen. iii. 15. He was afterwards recog|nized by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive prophets, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages; and

Daniel u&s;hered in the preci&s;e time in which the Me&s;&s;iah was to appear. Chap. ix. Paul, well con|ver&s;ant with the Hebrew prophecies, informs, that <HI>when the fulne&s;s of time was come, God &s;ent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law; that we might receive the adoption of &s;ons.</HI> Gal, iv. 4, 5. Je&s;us, Me&s;&s;iah, the Son of God, ap|peared, &s;pent thirty years in private life, according to the Hebrew law, and began his public mini&s;try: this being accompli&s;hed, he goes up to Jeru&s;alem voluntarily, to &s;uffer and to die. In view of the cro&s;s he cries, "<HI>Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son that thy Son may al&s;o glorify thee.</HI>" John xvii. 1. The memorable point of time is arrived, in which all the &s;eries of prophecy and &s;acrifice are accompli&s;hed. He fini&s;hes the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, makes an end of &s;ins, makes reconciliation for iniquity, brings in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;eals up the vi&s;ion and prophecy. Daniel ix. 24. The pa&s;chal Lamb is now &s;lain; the law is magnified and made honourable both in precept and in penalty; the powers of darkne&s;s are overcome and bound in more than adamantine chains; death is di&s;armed of his dreadful &s;ting, and the gates of immortal life wide unfolded to every pious mind! Then, my &s;oul, admire this ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel day&mdash;

<P>V. As there is a time for a man's natural birth, &s;o there is al&s;o a period for his &s;piritual birth; <HI>ex|cept a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God;</HI> and by which, in <HI>time,</HI> the &s;oul is habitually prepared for an eternal &s;tate. By their fruits ye &s;hall know them. Man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of carnal appetites and de&s;ires, never can be happy in the enjoyment of &s;piritual, holy, and heavenly re|alities; there is, therefore, a moral nece&s;&s;ity for his being born again in time; and, by which, his &s;oul is brought to ta&s;te, feel, and enjoy tho&s;e &s;acred ble&s;&s;ings unknown, if not de&s;pi&s;ed by him before. <HI>Time,</HI> the precious gift of God, he views with new eyes; redeems what is lo&s;t, and improves the pre&s;ent to the noble purpo&s;es of glorifying God, and promoting the benefits of his fellow mortals.

One peculiarity is worthy our remark: every man, by natural birth, is born to die; but he that is born of the Spirit, and believeth in Chri&s;t, <HI>&s;hall never die eternally;</HI> and with this mo&s;t comfortable per&s;ua&s;ion, <HI>he pa&s;&s;es the time of his &s;ojourning here,</HI> in pro&s;pect of an eternal &s;tate of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s with God beyond the vale of death.

<HEAD>THE MISER.</HEAD>
<P>MR. OSTERVALD, a well known banker, died in France, 1790. This man, originally of Neu&s;chatel, felt the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e of ava|rice &s;o &s;trongly, that within a few days of his death, no importunities could induce him to buy a few pounds of meat for the purpo&s;e of making him a little &s;oup. "'Tis true," &s;aid he, "I &s;hould not di&s;like the &s;oup, but I have no appetite for the meat, what then is to become of that?" At the time he refu&s;ed this nouri&s;hment, for fear of being obliged to give away two or three pounds of meat, there was tied round his neck a &s;ilken bag, which contained eight hundred affignats of one thou&s;and livres each. At his out&s;et in life, he drank a pint of beer, which &s;erved him for &s;upper, at a hou&s;e much frequented, from which he carried home all the bottle-corks he could come at. Of the&s;e, in the cour&s;e of eight years, he had collect|ed as many as &s;old for twelve louis-d'ors, a &s;um that laid the foundation of his future fortune, the &s;uper&s;tructure of which was rapidly rai&s;ed by his uncommon &s;ucce&s;s of &s;tock-jobbing. He died po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of three millions of livres; that is, one hundred and twenty-five thou&s;and pounds &s;terling!</P>

con&s;iderable &s;um, upon which, as an excu&s;e for not complying with the demand, he pleaded ex|treme poverty; but fearing lea&s;t &s;ome of the inha|bitants of Languedoc &s;hould give information to the contrary, and his hou&s;e &s;hould be &s;earched, he re&s;olved on hiding his trea&s;ure in &s;uch a manner as to e&s;cape the mo&s;t &s;trict examination. He dug a cave in his wine-cellar, which he made &s;o large and deep that he u&s;ed to go down to it with a lad|der: at the entrance was a door with a &s;pring-lock upon it, which, on &s;hutting, would fa&s;ten of it&s;elf. Very lately Mon&s;ieur Fo&s;cue was mi&s;&s;ing; dili|gent &s;earch was made after him in every place; the ponds were drawn, and every method which hu|man imagination could &s;ugge&s;t, was taken for finding him, but in vain. In a &s;hort time after, his hou&s;e was &s;old, and the purcha&s;er beginning either to rebuild it or to make &s;ome alteration in it, the workmen di&s;covered a door in the cellar, with a key in the lock, which being opened, and on going down, they found Mon&s;ieur Fo&s;cue lying dead upon the ground, with a candle&s;tick near him, but no candle in it, which he had eaten; and on &s;earching farther, they found the va&s;t wealth which he had ama&s;&s;ed. It it &s;uppo&s;ed that when Mon|&s;ieur Fo&s;cue went into his cave, the door by &s;ome accident &s;hut after him; and being out of the call

THE DOG.</HEAD>
<P>THIS cla&s;s of animals may be principally di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by their claws, which have no &s;heath, like tho&s;e of the cat kind; by their having &s;ix cutting-teeth, and two canine in each jaw: al&s;o by their having five toes before, and four behind. But,
<PB N="17" REF="038552_0018_10125843E8D8C1B0">
though this is invariable in the wild &s;pecies, &s;uch as the wolf, &amp;c. the common dogs have frequently five toes on each foot. The tail of tho&s;e of the dog kind bends towards the left, a character com|mon to the whole &s;pecies, and fir&s;t di&s;covered by Linnaeus.</P>
<P>Of all animals the dog is the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of change in its form, its varieties being almo&s;t num|berle&s;s: each will mix with the other, and produce varieties &s;till more unlike the original &s;tock. The climate, the food, and the education, make &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions upon this animal, and produce altera|tions in its &s;hape, colour, hair, and &s;ize; and in every thing but its nature. All dogs are evidently of one kind; but which of them is the original, from whence &s;uch a variety of de&s;cendants have &s;prung, is not ea&s;ily to be determined. Mr. Buffon makes the chien de berger, the &s;hepherd's dog, to be the original, it being naturally the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible; and becomes, without di&s;cipline, almo&s;t in&s;tantly the guardian of the flocks, and keeps them within bounds.</P>
<P>The dog is the mo&s;t intelligent of all known quadrupeds, and the acknowledged friend of man|kind. At night the guard of the hou&s;e is commit|ted to his care, and he &s;eems proud of the charge; he continues a watchful centinel, goes his rounds,
<PB N="18" REF="038552_0019_101258465F36C0D0">
&s;cents &s;trangers at a di&s;tance, and warns them of his being upon duty. His voice is more readily obeyed by the flock and the herd, than even that of the &s;hepherd or the hu&s;bandman. The dog is formed for the cha&s;e, and affords equal a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the &s;port&s;man: his &s;cent is more exqui&s;ite than that of other animals in the pur&s;uit of game, and can di&s;tingui&s;h his ma&s;ter from among a thou&s;and.</P>
<P>Some of the varieties of the dog, are, the &s;hep|herd's dog, the hound, the &s;paniel, the grey-hound, the ma&s;tiff, the bull-dog, the terrier, the blood-hound, the tumbler, the lap-dog, lion-dog, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The heathen con&s;ecrated the dog to Mercury, as the mo&s;t vigilant and crafty of the gods; becau&s;e watchfulne&s;s and &s;agacity are the properties of that animal. The Japane&s;e give the following names to the twelve &s;igns of the Zodiac, and the twelve hours of the day. The fir&s;t they call the rat, &s;e|cond the cow, third the tyger, fourth the hare, fifth the dragon, &s;ixth the &s;erpent, &s;eventh the hor&s;e, eighth the &s;heep, ninth the ape, tenth the cock, eleventh the dog, and twelfth the boar. The em|peror who was upon the throne when Kaempfer was in Japan, was born under the eleventh &s;ign, or the <HI>dog;</HI> con&s;equently he had a great fondne&s;s for that animal. According to an edict publi&s;hed by that prince, all the dogs that died within his do|minions
<PB N="19" REF="038552_0020_10125847F85EC558">
were to be carried to the top of a moun|tain, there to be buried with great pomp. A poor man, who was carrying his dog to the appointed &s;pot, finding the dead carca&s;e heavy, and the way long, began to murmur again&s;t the orders of his &s;overeign, upon which a neighbour, who accom|panied him, ob&s;erved with much propriety, that in|&s;tead of complaining, he ought, on the contrary, to thank the gods, who, in their wi&s;dom, had de|creed that the emperor &s;hould not be born under the &s;ign of the <HI>hor&s;e;</HI> "for," &s;aid he, "a hor&s;e would have been a much more di&s;agreeable burden than a <HI>dog.</HI>"</P>
<P>I will here take leave to introduce to our readers the practice of the Guebres of Per&s;ia, to tho&s;e who are in the act of expiring in death; the attendants rai&s;e the poor man, and a near relation pre&s;ents a dog to his mouth, on a &s;uppo&s;ition that the breath, or &s;oul, will be communicated to that animal, and be happy. No le&s;s extraordinary is the practice of this people towards the body after death. This is laid decently upon the ground, under the walls of the intended &s;epulchre, while one of the rela|tions goes round the village to try if he can allure a dog to follow him. He does all he can to bring the animal as near as po&s;&s;ible to the corp&s;e, for they imagine that the nearer the dog comes, the
<PB N="20" REF="038552_0021_1012584A77376428">
nearer the departed &s;oul is to everla&s;ting happine&s;s. But if the dog cannot be tempted to approach it, then it is con&s;idered as a bad omen, and they al|mo&s;t de&s;pair of his felicity. When the dog has performed the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned him, two prie&s;ts, &s;tand|ing about ten yards di&s;tant from the body, repeat a form of prayer half an hour in length. During the whole of this ceremony, the corp&s;e has a piece of paper fixed to each ear, and hangs over the face about three inches below the chin. As &s;oon as the prayers are over, the corp&s;e is carried to the place allotted for its reception, and all the company fol|low it, two and two, with their hands devoutly clo&s;ed. They are enjoined not to &s;peak a word, becau&s;e they believe their &s;epulchre is a place of &s;ilence and repo&s;e.</P>
<P>While we lament the general ignorance of the Guebres, we perceive that they had a &s;trong con|viction that the &s;oul &s;urvived the death of the body; and that, in its &s;eparate &s;tate, it was capable of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery. How inexcu&s;able, therefore, are tho&s;e of our clime who pretend to greater de|grees of rationality and refinement, and yet pre|&s;ume, at lea&s;t to profe&s;s, that the &s;oul either &s;leeps with the body in the grave, or is entirely annihi|lated? Thankful ought we to be for the volume of revelation which de&s;cribes the nature, qualities, and
<PB N="21" REF="038552_0022_1012584E03E44EB0">
immortality of the &s;oul, and opens to us, in the mo&s;t rational, &s;ublime, and God-honouring &s;cenes, what awaits us beyond the vale of death; and points us, at the &s;ame time, to an all-&s;ufficient Saviour, who is <HI>the way, the truth, and the life.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;cripture, for the purpo&s;e of conveying in|&s;truction to our minds, and of de&s;ignating &s;ome particular characters, has named the <HI>dog,</HI> the ani|mal now under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>A dog, a dead dog, a dog's head, were frequently named to expre&s;s an in&s;ignificant and vile per&s;on. Eli&s;ha, the prophet, being in&s;pired by God to fore&s;ee the future evil conduct of Hazael, thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&mdash;<HI>I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of I&s;rael: their &s;trong holds wilt thou &s;et on fire, and their young men wilt thou &s;lay with the &s;word, and wilt da&s;h their children, and rip up their women with child.</HI> Hazael replied&mdash;<HI>What, is thy fervent a</HI> DOG, <HI>that he &s;hould do this great thing?</HI> 2 Kings viii. 12, 13. But however this wicked man profe&s;&s;ed an ab|horrence to &s;uch atrocious actions, yet it is cer|tain that the wretched <HI>dog did cut I&s;rael &s;hort, and &s;mote them in all their coa&s;t.</HI> x. 32.</P>
<P>As in the days of I&s;aiah, &s;o in every age, there are fal&s;e teachers, wicked per&s;ons, not called of God, that intrude them&s;elves upon the people,
<PB N="22" REF="038552_0023_101258507B1AEF88">
who are ju&s;tly &s;aid to be <HI>blind, ignorant, dumb dogs, that cannot bark;</HI> therefore, not fit to give an alarm in time of danger, nor give faithful in&s;truc|tion to others;&mdash;they are <HI>&s;leeping dogs, lying down, loving to &s;lumber;</HI> and &s;o quite unfit to watch the gates of Zion;&mdash;<HI>greedy dogs; that can never have enough,</HI> they love the fleece better than the flock, con|&s;tantly preying upon rich and poor without filling their own belly. I&s;a. lvi. 10, 11. Such per&s;ons, let them be found among whatever religious denominations they may, mu&s;t prove a cur&s;e in&s;tead of a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Satan, the devil, is called a <HI>dog;</HI> a fierce blood-hound, &s;eeking the de&s;truction of the &s;ouls of men; and who combatted Chri&s;t in the wilderne&s;s, and upon the cro&s;s, but foiled and made pri&s;oner in chains. P&s;m. xxii, 20. I may now call Satan the &s;hepherd's dog: Chri&s;t, the chief &s;hepherd of I&s;rael, making u&s;e of him as a &s;hepherd doth his dog, to keep his flock together, and making all his howl|ings and barkings, his vile efforts, &s;ub&s;ervient to his plea&s;ure, and the highe&s;t intere&s;t of his cho&s;en flock.</P>
<P>To gratify our young readers, in particular, I &s;hall clo&s;e this piece of natural hi&s;tory, by reciting &s;ome well authenticated anecdotes of the &s;agacity and faithfulne&s;s of the dog.</P>
<P>Of the following incident Plutarch affirms that
<PB N="23" REF="038552_0024_1012585219061CD8">
he, him&s;elf, was an eye-witne&s;s. Being once on &s;hip-board, he ob&s;erved a jar which was about half filled with oil. A dog was very de&s;irous of paying his addre&s;&s;es to the contents, but the oil was too low in the containing ve&s;&s;el for him to get at it. The &s;eamen were all engaged different ways; and the dog, willing to make the mo&s;t of the fa|vourable opportunity, took up, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, a num|ber of &s;tones which were &s;towed in that part of the &s;hip, and dropping them, one by one, into the jar, the oil at la&s;t ro&s;e within his reach, and he lapped as much of it as he plea&s;ed. "<HI>I was a&s;toni&s;hed,</HI>" &s;ays Plutarch, "<HI>by what means the dog could &s;a|gaciou&s;ly know, that the immi&s;&s;ion of heavier &s;ub&s;tances would cau&s;e the lighter &s;ub&s;tance to a&s;cend.</HI>"</P>
<P>A &s;ervant of Sir Henry Lee had formed a de|&s;ign of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating his ma&s;ter, and robbing the hou&s;e. That very night, a ma&s;tiff dog, which had never been much noticed by Sir Henry, for the fir&s;t time followed him up &s;tairs, got under the bed, and could not be got from thence, by either ma&s;ter or man. In the dead of night the &s;ame &s;ervant entered the room to execute his horrid de|&s;ign, but was in&s;tantly &s;eized by the dog; and be|ing &s;ecured, confe&s;&s;ed his intention. In memory of this pre&s;ervation, Sir Henry Lee engaged John|&s;ton,

the celebrated painter, who drew a portrait of Sir Henry, with the ma&s;tiff by his &s;ide; and in one corner of the picture, are ten laconic lines, concluding thus&mdash;

<P>The dead body of a Roman &s;oldier, who had been killed in a dome&s;tic tumult, was carefully watched and guarded by his dog; who would not permit any per&s;on to touch the remains of his de|parted ma&s;ter. PYRRHUS, the king, pa&s;&s;ing by that way, took notice of &s;o &s;triking a &s;pectacle, and inquired into the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e. On being informed that the man had been &s;lain three days before, and that the dog, in all that time, had neither &s;tirred from the body, nor taken any food, the king ordered the body to be buried, and the dog to be brought to him. The creature &s;oon grew fond of Pyrrhus, who, &s;hortly after, ordering his forces to mu&s;ter, the &s;oldiers pa&s;&s;ed be|fore him in review. During this ceremony, the dog, for &s;ome time, lay quiet at his feet; till &s;eeing tho&s;e &s;oldiers march by who had murdered his late ma&s;|ter, he &s;prung at them with &s;uch rage and fierce|ne&s;s, and turned him&s;elf to Pyrrhus with &s;uch meaning in his looks and ge&s;tures, that the men were &s;ent to pri&s;on, on &s;u&s;picion of having com|mitted

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONG the phaenomena of winter, no one is more worthy of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion than that of SNOW, which is confe&s;&s;edly one of the mo&s;t curious pro|ductions of nature; and, from the remote&s;t ages of antiquity, has excited the admiration of philo&s;o|phers and poets. We &s;hall, therefore, offer our readers a few philo&s;ophical remarks upon the &s;ub|ject, and then advert to the &s;criptures, which not only corroborate the dictate of &s;ound philo&s;ophy, but, under the emblem of &s;now, afford us le&s;&s;ons of &s;piritual in&s;truction.</P>
<P>Snow is formed by the freezing of the vapours in the atmo&s;phere. It differs from hail and hoar|fro&s;t in being, as it were, cry&s;tallized, which they are not. This appears, on examination of a flake of &s;now by a magnifying gla&s;s; when the whole of
<PB N="26" REF="038552_0027_1012585AA616CF08">
it will appear to be compo&s;ed of fine &s;hining &s;pi|cula, diverging like rays from a centre. As the flakes fall down through the atmo&s;phere, they are continually joined by more of the&s;e radiated &s;picula, and thus increa&s;e in bulk, like the drops of rain or hail-&s;tones. Dr. Grew ob&s;erves, that many parts of &s;now are of a regular figure, for the mo&s;t part &s;o many little rowels, or &s;tars of &s;ix points, and are as perfect and tran&s;parent ice as any we &s;ee on a pond. Upon each of the&s;e points are other colla|teral points, &s;et at the &s;ame angles as the main points them&s;elves; among which there are divers other irregular, which are chiefly broken points, and fragments of the regular ones. Others al&s;o, by various winds, &s;eem to have been thawed, and froze again into irregular clu&s;ters, &s;o that it &s;eems as if the whole body of &s;now were an infinite ma&s;s of icicles irregularly figured; that is, a cloud of vapours being gathered into drops, the &s;aid drops forthwith de&s;cend; upon which de&s;cent, meeting with a freezing air as they pa&s;s through a colder region, each drop is immediately frozen into an icicle, &s;hooting it&s;elf forth into &s;everal points; but the&s;e &s;till continuing their de&s;cent, and meeting with &s;ome intermitting gales of warmer air, or in their continual wa&s;tage to and fro touching upon each other; &s;ome of them are a little thawed, blunt|ed,
<PB N="27" REF="038552_0028_1012585D1E258B68">
and again froze into clu&s;ters, or entangled &s;o as to fall down in what we call flakes. The lightne&s;s of &s;now, although it is firm ice, is owing to the exce&s;s of its &s;urface in compari&s;on of the matter contained in it; as gold it&s;elf may be extended in &s;urface till it will ride upon the lea&s;t breath of air. From &s;ome late experiments on the quantity of wa|ter yielded by &s;now, it appears that the latter gives only about one tenth of its bulk. The peculiar agency of &s;now as a fertilizer in preference to rain, may, without recurring to nitrous &s;alts &s;uppo&s;ed to be contained in it, be rationally a&s;cribed to its fur|ni&s;hing a covering for the roots of vegetables, by which they are guarded from the influence of the atmo&s;pherical cold, and the internal heat of the earth is prevented from e&s;caping. Whatever dif|ference may ari&s;e upon this &s;ubject, every true phi|lo&s;opher will pronounce the phaenomena of &s;now to be the production of the ALMIGHTY, under who&s;e &s;upreme controul every element is &s;ub&s;ervi|ent to his infinite plea&s;ure, and produces infinite benefits to mankind.</P>

<P>This &s;ubject is charmingly illucidated in the &s;crip|tures, and to which we will now repair. Con|templating the works of God, the writer of the book of Job declares&mdash;<HI>God thundereth marvel|ou&s;ly with his voice: great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend: for he &s;aith to the &s;now, be thou on the earth.</HI> Job xxxvii. 6. Je|hovah, in his expo&s;tulation with Job, inquires, <HI>Ha&s;t thou entered into the trea&s;ures of the &s;now; or ha&s;t thou &s;een the trea&s;ures of the hail?</HI> xxxviii. 22. <HI>He giveth,</HI> &s;aith David, <HI>&s;now like wool: he &s;cattereth the hoar-fro&s;t like a&s;hes. He ca&s;t|eth forth his ice like mor&s;els: who can &s;tand be|fore his cold?</HI> P&s;m. cxlvii. 16, 17. "At his com|mand, he maketh the &s;now to fall apace. As birds flying he &s;cattereth the &s;now, and the falling down thereof is as the lighting of gra&s;s-hoppers. The eye marveleth at the beauty of the whitene&s;s thereof, and the heart is a&s;toni&s;hed at the raining of it."</P>
<P>It is obvious that the productions of nature are employed by the Almighty, through the medium of the &s;cripture, to in&s;truct us in the un&s;earchable
<PB N="29" REF="038552_0030_1012585EB85F2ED0">
riches of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which are for the benefit of the &s;ubjects of his grace; who, I may &s;ay, con|&s;titute a &s;piritual world in animal life. It is wor|thy of remark, that all natural productions named in the &s;criptures, are &s;uch with which men are ge|nerally conver&s;ant, and of which the mo&s;t feeble mind can form &s;ome agreeable ideas. The ble&s;&s;ings of grace, however rich and abundant, are incom|prehen&s;ible by the eye of depraved rea&s;on:&mdash;<HI>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him; nei|ther can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritual|ly di&s;cerned.</HI> 1 Cor. ii. 14. Therefore, that mind which is illuminated by the rays of the SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, not only &s;ees God in every animal, vegetable, and fo&s;&s;ile production of nature, but gra&s;ps the whole as wonderfully de&s;igned by a wi&s;e and conde&s;cending God, to in&s;truct us in the more &s;ublime, &s;atiating riches of his grace.

<HEAD>A VERY SOLEMN OCCURRENCE!</HEAD>
<HEAD>Transcribed from The STAR, printed in London.</HEAD>
<P>THE Rev. Caleb Evans, D. D. pre&s;ident of the &s;eminary at Bri&s;tol for the education of young mini&s;ters, was called to vi&s;it a family that belonged to his congregation, and &s;aw a young lady &s;etting in an ea&s;y chair, who came to the <HI>hot wells</HI> for the benefit of her health, and boarded with them. Ob|&s;erving her unu&s;ually pen&s;ive, the Doctor took the liberty to inquire the rea&s;on. She an&s;wered&mdash;"Sir, I will think no more of it, it is only a dream; and I will not be &s;o childi&s;h as to be alarmed at a dream: but Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "I will tell you my dream, and then I will think no more of it." She then repeated as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P>"La&s;t night I dreamed I was at the ball where I intend to go to night: &s;oon after I was in the room, I was taken very ill, and they gave me a &s;melling bottle; and then I was brought home into
<PB N="34" REF="038552_0035_1012586C63AF21C0">
this room, and I was put into <HI>that</HI> chair, (pointing to an elbow chair) fainted, and died. I then thought I was carried to a place where were angels and holy people &s;inging hymns and prai&s;es to God; that I found my&s;elf very unhappy, and de&s;ired to go from them. My conductor &s;aid, if I did, I &s;hould <HI>never</HI> come there again: with that, he vio|lently whirled me <HI>out,</HI> and I fell down! down! down! through darkne&s;s, and thunderings, and &s;ul|phur, into flames; and when the flames began to &s;corch me, I was alarmed with hideous cries, <HI>and awaked.</HI>"</P>
<P>Dr. Evans made &s;ome &s;erious remarks on the dream, and de&s;ired the young lady not to go to the ball that night. She &s;aid &s;he would, for &s;he was more of a woman than to mind dreams. She went to the ball&mdash;was taken ill&mdash;a &s;melling-bottle was given her, according to her dream&mdash;&s;he was brought home, put into the chair above-mention|ed&mdash;fainted&mdash;died!</P>
<P>The well known re&s;pectability of Dr. Evans, and his di&s;po&s;ition in not receiving the &s;allies of fancy for realities, much le&s;s giving credit to the many imaginary &s;tories which float about the world under the denomination of religious: the&s;e were &s;ufficient inducements to the EDITOR to give the above narrative a place in this publication as truly

He makes no comment; he leaves it with his readers, and adds his affectionate wi&s;h, that the peru&s;al of it may be attended with &s;olemn reflection by the young and the gay; by which they may learn, that a character formed in this life, virtuous or vicious, will not fail to terminate the career of mortals, and introduce them to plea|&s;ures or to pains.</P>

<HEAD>A TROPHY OF GRACE, OR THE THIEF SAVED UPON THE CROSS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is generally ob&s;erved that the greate&s;t u&s;eful|ne&s;s of men is confined to the meridian of their life; but this will by no means apply to the Son of God while on our earth: for, although his whole life was &s;pent in teaching the ignorant, and in per|forming the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing miracles for the bene|fit of mankind, yet, his greate&s;t acts of mercy, and his mo&s;t valuable miracles, were re&s;erved for the la&s;t. Among the&s;e is the conver&s;ion of the thief who was crucified with him upon Calvary. As this is the &s;ubject for our pre&s;ent reflections, we will ex|amine the &s;tate of this poor man while in the pur|&s;uit of &s;in; the marks of Chri&s;t's interpo&s;ing grace while the thief was upon the cro&s;s in the very ago|nies

<P>I. Examine the ca&s;e of this poor man. St. Mat|thew and Mark inform us that he and his com|panions were <HI>thieves;</HI> for which, they were con|demned by the law of their country, to die upon the cro&s;s. What they had &s;tolen, from whom, or how frequently they had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, we are not informed; but of this we are certain, that they had not only injured their fellow creatures by de|priving them of their property, expo&s;ing them|&s;elves to a &s;hameful death, but that, by <HI>&s;in,</HI> they had robbed God of his honour and them&s;elves of happine&s;s, and expo&s;ed them&s;elves to his di&s;plea&s;ure. <HI>Ye are cur&s;ed with a cur&s;e, for ye have robbed me, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> Mal. iii. 8, 9. The man who is the particular &s;ubject of our attention, could not be in&s;en&s;ible of the horrid di&s;grace to which his crimes had expo&s;ed him; his &s;oul mu&s;t have been filled with horror, <HI>for a wicked man is loath&s;ome and cometh to &s;hame.</HI> Prov. xiii. 5.

<HEAD>OBITUARY.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 26th of September, 1795, died, in the 32d year of his age, of the malignant fever which then prevailed in New-York, the Rev. JACOB BRUSH, one of the Elders of the Methodi&s;t Epi&s;|copal Church. Mr. Bru&s;h attended Mr. Court|ney, at who&s;e hou&s;e he boarded, and who died of the fever; and on the next Lord's-day he preached a &s;ermon on the occa&s;ion, from Matt. xxv. 23. in the new church. Mr. Bru&s;h, immediately on his return home, was taken ill, langui&s;hed five days and died, and on the Sabbath following the Rev. Mr. King&s;ton preached a &s;ermon, from Rev. xiv. 13. in the &s;ame pulpit, on the death of Mr. Bru&s;h.
<PB N="47" REF="038552_0048_1012588CA451C290">
Shall not this event make a &s;olemn impre&s;&s;ion upon &s;urviving Mini&s;ters, that they may &s;o faithfully di&s;|charge their office as to be ready to go from the pulpit to the tribunal of Jehovah? What is yet remarkable, Mr. Bru&s;h, in a few days, was to have been married to Mi&s;s E. M.&mdash;How &s;oon may our mo&s;t plea&s;ing pro&s;pects be over-ca&s;t, and we torn from the embraces of our friends, and lodged in the chambers of corruption!</P>
<P>Mr. Bru&s;h, at an early period of life, became &s;eriou&s;ly affected with divine things. After deep di&s;tre&s;s for &s;in, he obtained faith in Chri&s;t as his Saviour. He then thought it his duty to preach the Go&s;pel of that Chri&s;t who had done &s;o much for his &s;oul, and in 1785 he was admitted as proba|tioner into the Conferrence of Methodi&s;t Mini&s;|ters. In 1788 he was ordained a <HI>Deacon,</HI> and in 1790 he entered the <HI>Elder&s;hip.</HI> As a mini&s;ter, he was zealous, wi&s;e, bold and &s;ucce&s;sful; as a chri&s;|tian, devout and circum&s;pect; and as a friend, &s;ympathetic, kind and con&s;tant. In his la&s;t &s;ick|ne&s;s he appeared &s;olemnly happy; and, a few hours before his death, he was a&s;ked "Whether he felt happy in God, and had an a&s;&s;urance of the divine favour?" To which (by &s;igns) he an&s;wered in the affirmative. The la&s;t Lord's-day that he preached he appeared to be &s;o re&s;igned to the will

of God, that &s;ome of the hearers ob&s;erved, "they never heard him preach with &s;o much power before, and that he &s;eemed to preach as though it were his la&s;t."</P>
<P>Thus was cut off, in the prime of life, a pro|mi&s;ing and u&s;eful Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, and as highly beloved among the people of his connection.</P>

<HEAD>An ESSAY on the POWER of CHRIST.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Rev. GEORGE STREBECK.</BYLINE>
<P>WHO would conclude, that the babe of Beth|lehem, the tender plant which &s;hot forth from the &s;tem of Je&s;&s;e, &s;hould ever be the great and mighty Potentate of the univer&s;e! That HE, who &s;uffered death on the cro&s;s, &s;hould ever travail in the great|ne&s;s of his &s;trength! Yet &s;o it was. JESUS bur&s;t the bands of death, triumphed over the grave, and
<PB N="50" REF="038552_0052_1012589695D278B8">
declared that "<HI>all power in heaven and in earth was given unto him.</HI>"</P>
<P>I will not detain you to inquire in what re&s;pects his power is, that of <HI>authority</HI> or <HI>ability,</HI> but ra|ther take notice of its <HI>extent,</HI> and inquire how it was a <HI>gift</HI> unto him.</P>
<P N="1">1. He exerci&s;es his power <HI>in heaven.</HI> O! how different the view of Je&s;us in the &s;tate of his humi|liation, and that glorious &s;tate of exaltation which he enjoys at the right-hand of the Father! Tho&s;e temples which once were crowned with thorns, wear now the crown of glory and maje&s;ty! Tho&s;e hands which once were nailed to the cro&s;s, now hold the &s;ceptre of his kingdom! It is a &s;triking evidence of the power which Chri&s;t exerci&s;es in heaven, that angels, with the &s;uperior authorities of the cele&s;tial abode, are &s;ubject to his authority and control. It was &s;aid of Jacob, that like a prince he had power with GOD and prevailed; but in how much more con&s;picuous light does the power|ful interce&s;&s;ion of JESUS appear in heaven? His <HI>blood</HI> is a powerful advocate for penitent &s;inners before the throne above! It &s;peaks better things than the blood of the mo&s;t dear and co&s;tly &s;acri|fices! 'Tis that which opens a new and living way to the throne and affections of our heavenly
<PB N="51" REF="038552_0053_101258982F4A3768">
Father, and procures that for us which the riches a <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> could never obtain.</P>
<P>It is a further evidence of the power which Chri&s;t has given him in heaven, that <HI>heaven</HI> it&s;elf is at his di&s;po&s;al. This is currently acknowledged in the &s;acred pages. PAUL declares his expectation of receiving a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s, as <HI>the gift</HI> of his righteous judge. And JESUS him&s;elf promi&s;es a crown of life, and a participation of his glory, to tho&s;e who overcome, by his blood, and remain faithful unto death.</P>
<P N="2">2. On <HI>earth</HI> al&s;o Chri&s;t has all power given unto him. The natural and moral world are &s;ub|ject to him. At his command the wheels of na|ture roll;&mdash;the &s;un goeth forth from his cham|ber, and as a giant rejoiceth to run his race;&mdash;the &s;ilver queen gilds the night, and the twinkling flames &s;hine in their &s;everal orbits. But let us more particularly contemplate the power which he exer|ci&s;es with regard to the <HI>rational</HI> creation. He has power given him over the heart of man, to change and make it new; to enlighten the dark under|&s;tanding; to incline the &s;tubborn and refractory di&s;po&s;ition of the will; to be&s;tow repentance unto life; and to rai&s;e the &s;inner, who is dead in tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, to a new life of righteou&s;ne&s;s! In the days of his humiliation, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power
<PB N="52" REF="038552_0054_1012589AB21A9578">
of forgiving &s;in. On the cro&s;s this power was evinced in the pardon of the penitent thief; and now he is exalted at the right-hand of the Maje&s;ty on high: the apo&s;tle in&s;tructs us, that through him is preached unto us the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins. His power on earth is further evidenced in the &s;upport and protection of his church. How oft would &s;he have peri&s;hed in the waters of affliction, or been con&s;umed in the flames of per&s;ecution, had &s;he not been protected by his powerful arm! Although &s;he is repre&s;ented as fleeing into the wilderne&s;s from the face of the dragon, we behold her coming up again leaning on her beloved. Mo&s;t gladly, there|fore, may &s;he endure and rejoice in her various af|flictions, that the power of Chri&s;t may re&s;t upon her: and, although many of the human race ac|knowledge not the authority of Chri&s;t, nor bow to the &s;ceptre of his grace, yet the&s;e al&s;o are &s;ubject to his power. The power of Satan it&s;elf is limited by the power of Je&s;us: nor can any of the powers of this world, in all their combinations, elude the con|trol of HIM who doth all his &s;overeign will among the kingdoms of men; who, &s;itting in the heavens, holds all their malicious machinations in deri&s;ion, will break them as with a rod of iron, and da&s;h them in pieces like a potter's ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P N="3">3. This power Chri&s;t him&s;elf declares to be
<PB N="53" REF="038552_0055_1012589C5F808788">
<HI>given</HI> to him. But let not the &s;ons of infidelity be premature in their triumphs on that account. As GOD, it is <HI>not</HI> given to him. The <HI>fulne&s;s</HI> of the GODHEAD dwelt bodily in him. He con&s;equently, as &s;uch, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every divine perfection in the ample&s;t and mo&s;t independent manner. But as <HI>Me|diator</HI> between GOD and man, we can ea&s;ily con|ceive how Je&s;us po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this power as the gift of the Father. In <HI>this</HI> character he very frequently acknowledges the &s;uperiority of the Father: "My Father is <HI>greater</HI> than I." In this character, he confe&s;&s;es the in&s;tructions and commandments which he had received from his father relative to his office, and in this character al&s;o he expre&s;&s;ly a&s;&s;erts the power he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. To his di&s;ciples who had con|tinued with him in his temptation, he declared thus: "I <HI>appoint</HI> unto you a kingdom, <HI>as</HI> my Father hath appointed unto me." This is an in&s;tance of the power which Chri&s;t exerci&s;es in heaven. Now, the Father appointed his reward unto him as <HI>Medi|ator,</HI> by covenant agreement, con&s;equently his ap|pointing a kingdom to his followers, <HI>as</HI> the Father appointed unto him mu&s;t &s;ignify, that he made that appointment in the exerci&s;e of his mediatorial office. Another example of his exerci&s;ing his power on earth as Mediator is recorded in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> P&s;alm. Solemnly inaugurated and proclaimed king of Zion,
<PB N="54" REF="038552_0056_101258A08DF5F1B0">
his reward for the di&s;charge of his office, for which he is authorized to a&s;k, is the heathen for an in|heritance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. And, at the &s;ame time, is ve&s;ted with power to de&s;troy tho&s;e who &s;ubmit not to his au|thority! v. 8. The power, therefore, which he exerci&s;es in heaven and earth was <HI>given</HI> him, not as he was GOD, but as he was Mediator between GOD and man.</P>
<P>And, 4. In that character it was given him as the <HI>reward</HI> of his obedience and &s;ufferings. Thus we are clearly in&s;tructed in &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of the holy &s;criptures. ISAIAH declares, chap. liii. that al|though his &s;oul &s;hould be made an offering for &s;in, his days &s;hould be prolonged, and that he &s;hould be &s;atisfied in &s;eeing the travail of his &s;oul. And PAUL more expre&s;&s;ly declares, that on account of his voluntary humiliation, GOD hath highly exalt|ed him, and given him a name above every name that is named, at which every knee &s;hould bow, in token of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his mediatorial authority.</P>
<P N="5">5. A few <HI>reflections</HI> &s;hall clo&s;e this &s;hort e&s;&s;ay. And how <HI>con&s;olatory</HI> is the idea of the Mediator's power in heaven and earth to the believing mind? Hence they defy, and re&s;t &s;afe and &s;ecure in the pre&s;ence of the &s;harpe&s;t &s;pite and rage of Satan and all his legions. God is for, who, therefore, can
<PB N="55" REF="038552_0057_101258A2274F85B8">
be <HI>again&s;t</HI> them? The power of Chri&s;t is their defence from all danger; and will be their &s;ecurity and their &s;afeguard amid&s;t all the &s;urrounding af|flictions and &s;torms of life. But how <HI>alarming</HI> is the power of Chri&s;t to the impenitent! To them he appears in all the &s;trength of his maje&s;ty; not as the Lamb of God, but as the lion of the tribe of Judah. Let us therefore &s;eek, by a timely recon|ciliation with him, to elude the fearfulne&s;s of his powerful di&s;plea&s;ure. Let us "ki&s;s the Son, le&s;t he be angry, and we peri&s;h from the day when his wrath is kindled but a little."</P>

<HEAD>ANECDOTE OF THE KING OF HUN|GARY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS king was extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed on account of the &s;inful &s;tate of his &s;oul, and appeared before his brother exceedingly dejected. His brother, the duke, in&s;i&s;ted on knowing the rea&s;on; to whom the king replied, "O brother, I have been a great &s;inner again&s;t God, and I know not how to ap|pear before his judgment-&s;eat." The duke, a man of bri&s;k gallantry, not unlike our modern free|thinkers, replied, "The&s;e are but melancholy thoughts," and made light of them.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="038552_0058_101258A4CC88C550">
The king an&s;wered nothing at that time; but the cu&s;tom of that country was, (the king being ab&s;olute) if the executioner &s;ounded his trumpet at a man's door, he mu&s;t in&s;tantly prepare for exe|cution. The king &s;ent the executioner at mid|night, and cau&s;ed him to &s;ound a trumpet before the duke's door; who, hearing and &s;eeing the me&s;&s;enger of death, ran, trembling, and fell up|on his knees before the king, be&s;eeching him to declare wherein he had offended him? "O, bro|ther," &s;aid the king, "you never offended me, but loved me; but is the &s;ight of an earthly executioner &s;o terrible to thee, and &s;hall not I, who am &s;o great a &s;inner, fear much more to be brought be|fore the judgment-&s;eat of an angry God?"</P>

<HEAD>A TROPHY OF GRACE, OR THE THIEF SAVED UPON THE CROSS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>[Continued from page 44, and concluded.]</HEAD>
<P>HAVING treated on the &s;aved thief upon the cro&s;s, No. 1. vol. ii. p. 44, we now proceed to offer &s;uch in&s;truction as may be deduced from the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I. Mark, the Evangeli&s;t, by this very remarkable &s;cene on Calvary, leads us to &s;ee the literal fulfil|ment
<PB N="57" REF="038552_0059_101258A6688630F8">
of prophecy. I&s;aiah &s;aith, in chap. liii. 12. <HI>He was numbered with the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors.</HI> Mark xv. 28. In this in&s;tance, how great was the con|de&s;cen&s;ion of Immanuel! and, how &s;ignificant was it of his office as a &s;in-bearer, I&s;a. liii. placed on the cro&s;s, between two, who, for their crimes, were hanging between the heavens and the earth, as outca&s;ts from both? A lively repre&s;entation of all mankind, who, by their &s;ins, had robbed God of his honour in his law, and their own &s;ouls of im|mortal bli&s;s, in them&s;elves &s;u&s;pended, by the brittle thread of life, between heaven and hell! And if Je&s;us &s;aves his people from their &s;ins, he mu&s;t be num|bered with them, and bear the awful cur&s;e in their &s;tead. He did &s;o. <HI>Chri&s;t hath redeemed us from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us: for it is written, Cur&s;ed is every one that hang|eth on a tree, that the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Gal. iii. 13, 14.</P>
<P>II. In the conver&s;ion of the crucified thief we have a noble in&s;tance of Chri&s;t's free grace and power to &s;ave the chief of &s;inners, in the greate&s;t &s;orrows, and at the late&s;t period of their lives.</P>
<P>No man can attentively review this &s;cene, but mu&s;t believe the &s;overeignty of Chri&s;t's grace, how|ever prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of human merit. Here
<PB N="58" REF="038552_0060_101258AA9FABD190">
are two men, both thieves; both condemned; both revilers of Chri&s;t; both &s;uffering death upon the cro&s;s; both de&s;erving God's wrath, and ha&s;tening to receive the ju&s;t rewards of their deeds in awful eternity; yet, the one is taken, the other left. One &s;oul is plucked as a brand from the burning, the other left to con&s;ume! Rich the mercy that reached the one: ju&s;t the judgment that left the other. Will a profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tian call this conduct of Chri&s;t in que&s;tion? Surely he took one &s;oul as a proof, that he came to &s;ave &s;ome; he left the other as a te&s;timony that he &s;hould not &s;ave all. Therefore, let &s;inners in their &s;ins tremble; and let tho&s;e who have hope in their Saviour be cloathed with humility. One man dies wretched in his &s;ins, in the very &s;ight of Chri&s;t's blood-&s;hedding; the other dies in peace, by virtue of the &s;ame blood, and looks for an endle&s;s Paradi&s;e! From this, as well as many other in&s;tances recorded in the &s;cripture, we mu&s;t be convinced, that man's &s;uppo&s;ed merit weighs nothing in the &s;cale of &s;alvation, though proud, fallen nature, would lift her head, and de|mand an everla&s;ting crown as her own reward.</P>
<P>As a farther proof of the total depravity of hu|man nature, and its di&s;dain of a complete &s;alvation, in a crucified Chri&s;t, as exemplified in the impeni|tent thief, I &s;hall add, that, if he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the
<PB N="59" REF="038552_0061_101258AC39422C30">
lea&s;t degree of natural or moral ability to have &s;aved him&s;elf, there were circum&s;tances every way calculated to have drawn them forth. His &s;tate was equal with his fellow &s;ufferers; he was nailed to the cro&s;s at the &s;ame time; his condemnation, by the law, the &s;ame; he equally felt the powers of approaching death; he &s;aw the Saviour in his &s;uf|ferings, and heard his addre&s;&s;es; he hung the &s;ame time as did the other, upon the cro&s;s; they both out|lived Chri&s;t, and both witne&s;&s;ed his la&s;t words; both &s;aw the &s;upernatural eclip&s;e, and both felt the earth quake and tremble. All the&s;e things, which may amount to what &s;ome name calls opportunities, incitements to repentance, &amp;c. &amp;c. made no &s;ort of impre&s;&s;ion upon the heart of the hardened thief, and left him the very &s;ame man that they found him.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the pardoned thief po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed ex|ternal advantages &s;uperior to the other man; he was pointedly reproved by his fellow; he &s;aw and heard the amazing moral change in his companion; he heard his pathetic prayer to the Saviour, for a remembrance in his kingdom; and he heard the Sa|viour's promi&s;e of acceptance for future bli&s;s;&mdash;all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ed under his eye, and penetrated his ear; yet the poor man, with all the&s;e advantages, remained hardened in his crimes; he addre&s;&s;ed not
<PB N="60" REF="038552_0062_101258AEC3F2A2A8">
the Redeemer unle&s;s to revile him; he wi&s;hed not to be honoured with his remembrance; no, nor go into a Paradi&s;e, if he mu&s;t be indebted to a cru|cified Chri&s;t for the favour. He lived, he &s;uffered, he died in his &s;ins! Let us not boa&s;t of human ex|cellence, but be cloathed with humility. May we learn le&s;&s;ons of the deceit, the power, the &s;tupefac|tion of &s;in, and look to Chri&s;t for a free &s;alvation! In the poor, hardened, wretched thief, &s;ee human nature in the perfection of its depravity: in the other, behold the free triumphant grace of Chri&s;t in its meridian glory!</P>
<P>I think I may venture to &s;ay, that this &s;cene of Chri&s;t's grace on Calvary has its frequent likene&s;s among mankind, in every age, and in every place where the go&s;pel is preached. How many thou|&s;ands are there, who, for many years, &s;et under the &s;ound of the hi&s;tory and the truth of the go&s;pel, <HI>be|fore who&s;e eyes Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath been evidently &s;et forth, as crucified among them.</HI> Gal. iii. 1. Yet, like the impenitent thief, they di&s;dain and pe|ri&s;h in their &s;ins; while others, equally guilty and de|praved, who feel the virtues of the cro&s;s, are brought nigh to God, live an honour to his name, and die triumphant, with heaven beaming upon their &s;ouls. Thus, the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel is a favour of life to &s;ome, and of death to others. 2 Cor. ii. 15&mdash;17.
<PB N="61" REF="038552_0063_101258B05F52A570">
The difference of &s;ucce&s;s is re&s;olved into the grace of Chri&s;t whom we &s;erve:&mdash;<HI>By the grace of God, I am what I am!</HI></P>
<P>III. Let me a&s;k my READERS if they feel the importance of the&s;e reflections, and are convinced of their need of Chri&s;t to &s;ave them? Remember, you need the &s;ame grace, mercy, power, and love, to &s;ave <HI>you</HI> as did the thief upon the cro&s;s. Proud nature will not &s;ubmit to this. To be &s;aved, wholly by the blood, the unmerited grace of Je&s;us, which reached the vile malefactor's heart that died upon Calvary, is not what you will &s;ubmit to, until you have a ju&s;t &s;ight and an humbling &s;en&s;e of your depravity and guilt before an holy God! Then will you bow before the cro&s;s, while, with a believing eye, you behold the fountain of blood flowing from the Saviour's heart, to clean&s;e from foule&s;t &s;tains; yes, with <HI>Cowper</HI> you will &s;ay&mdash;
<Q><L>"The dying thief rejoic'd to see</L>
<L>That fountain in his day;</L>
<L>O may I there, though vile as he,</L>
<L>Wash all my sins away!"</L></Q></P>
<P>IV. To review this &s;cene upon Calvary, as con&s;tituting a part of the TRIUMPHS of CHRIST, &s;hall conclude our reflections. Our Lord entered upon the field of time, met &s;in, death, and hell, as
<PB N="62" REF="038552_0064_101258B493D59F18">
the foes of men, and, in order to conquer, he mu&s;t die the death of the cro&s;s; there on, <HI>blotting out the hand writing of ordinances that was again&s;t us, which was contrary to us, took it out of the way, nailing it to his cro&s;s: and having &s;poiled prin|cipalities, and powers, he made a &s;how of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</HI> Col. ii. 14, 15. He a&s;cended up on high, led captivity captive, &s;at down on the Father's right-hand, and gave gifts unto men, that the Lord God might dwell among them. While on the cro&s;s, though reeking in his gore, behold! he plucks the thief from the jaws of de&s;truction, embraces him in his bo&s;om, and bears him to Paradi&s;e, as a trophy of his grace, and to &s;how all heaven the virtue of his blood! Safe be|yond the vale of death, united with the &s;aints in glory, we congratulate the &s;aved thief; who, in ince&s;&s;ant &s;trains, unites with patriarchs, prophets, apo&s;tles, and the numberle&s;s redeemed&mdash;<HI>Ble&s;&s;ing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that &s;etteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever!</HI></P>

<HEAD>REPLY to Y. Z. in our la&s;t Number&mdash;"<HI>When will Faith and Hope cea&s;e?</HI>" 1 Cor. xiii. 13.</HEAD>
<P>PAUL concludes his beautiful de&s;cription of Charity in the&s;e words, <HI>Now abideth faith, hope, charity, the&s;e three: but the greate&s;t of the&s;e is charity.</HI> 1 Cor. xiii. 13. There is manife&s;tly a preference given to charity above faith and hope, chiefly becau&s;e faith and hope &s;hall have an end, but charity abideth for ever. Charity, or love, is the e&s;&s;ence of religion and moral virtue. This, in a very con&s;iderable degree, forms the happine&s;s of the chri&s;tian in this, and in a future &s;tate of ex|i&s;tence. It, therefore, &s;tands foremo&s;t in the li&s;t of chri&s;tian virtues. Faith and hope, though e&s;&s;en|tial to the chri&s;tian character, mu&s;t, I conceive, have an end: To illu&s;trate this, let me take St. Paul's de&s;cription of faith, in Heb. xi. 1. <HI>Now, faith is the &s;ub&s;tance of things hoped for, the evi|dence of things not &s;een.</HI> When, therefore, tho&s;e <HI>things not &s;een</HI> become vi&s;ible, and tho&s;e <HI>things hoped for</HI> arrive, there can then be no further room for <HI>faith</HI> to exerci&s;e it&s;elf; it mu&s;t, therefore, cea&s;e. The happine&s;s of heaven appears to me to be what the apo&s;tle alludes to as <HI>hoped for.</HI> By the eye of faith, the chri&s;tian &s;ees a glorious &s;alva|tion

THE HORSE.</HEAD>
<P>THE hor&s;e is a genus of quadrupeds, belonging to the order of belluae, in the cla&s;s mammalia. The genus comprehends the hor&s;e, the a&s;s, and tho zebra; they have &s;ix erect and parallel fore-teeth in the upper jaw, and &s;ix, &s;omewhat prominent ones, in the under jaw; the dog teeth are &s;olitary, and at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the re&s;t; and the feet con&s;i&s;t of an undivided hoof. The hor&s;e has not only a grandeur in his general appearance, but there is the greate&s;t &s;ymmetry and proportion in the different parts of his body. The regularity and
<PB N="68" REF="038552_0070_101258C2E7058850">
proportion of the different parts of the head, give him an air of lightne&s;s, which is well &s;upported by the &s;trength and beauty of his che&s;t. He erects his head as if willing to exalt him&s;elf above the condition of other quadrupeds: his eyes are open and lively; his ears are hand&s;ome and of a proper height; his mane adorns his neck, and gives him the appearance of &s;trength and boldne&s;s.</P>
<P>To view this maje&s;tic animal we mu&s;t look for him as nature has formed him, and placed him as an inhabitant of the exten&s;ive de&s;erts of Africa, in Arabia; and in tho&s;e va&s;t countries that &s;eparate Tartary from the more &s;outhern nations. Large a&s;&s;emblies of the&s;e animals are &s;een among the Tar|tars. Arabia produces a breed of hor&s;es, the mo&s;t beautiful, generous, &s;wift, and per&s;evering. Their colour is brown, their mane and tail very &s;hort, their hair black and tufted: their &s;wiftne&s;s is incre|dible. The method of taking them is by traps concealed in the &s;and, which entangling their feet, the hunter approaches them, and either kills or takes them alive.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e, with us, is a dome&s;tic animal, and is trained up for the purpo&s;e of hu&s;bandry, the plea&s;ure of the chace, and the &s;ervice of the war|rior; and, in each department, he proves him&s;elf a u&s;eful and magnanimous creature: admitting, at the
<PB N="69" REF="038552_0071_101258C58ACDCEE0">
&s;ame time, &s;uch a variety of &s;tages, qualities, and circum&s;tances, that the lower, as well as the higher orders of mankind, may avail them&s;elves of the be|nefit and the plea&s;ures he is calculated to afford. To the&s;e ob&s;ervations let me add, that the benefi|cent Creator hath &s;o ordered, that the animal now under reflection &s;hould not only be capable of rendering the highe&s;t &s;ervices to man while living, but that, after death, he &s;hould contribute to our ad|vantage. His skin is u&s;ed for traces, collars, and other parts of harne&s;s. Thus, even after death, he pre&s;erves &s;ome analogy to his &s;tate of &s;ervitude when alive.</P>
<P>The ea&s;tern heathens, the Per&s;ians, who wor|&s;hipped the &s;un, imagine that he rode along the &s;ky in a chariot drawn with fleet hor&s;es, to com|municate his light and warmth to mankind; they con&s;ecrated to him the fine&s;t &s;teeds, with which, in chariots, they rode to the ea&s;tern gates of their cities, as the &s;un ro&s;e, to pay their adoration, and to offer their &s;acrifices. Other heathens offered the hor&s;e to Mars, as the god of battles. Tacitus is &s;aid to have &s;upported white hor&s;es in the &s;acred woods, at the public charge, from which they drew omens: no one was even permitted to touch them; the prince and prie&s;t alone fa&s;ten them to a con&s;e|crated chariot accompanied them, and ob&s;erved their neighings and tremblings.</P>

Leaving the &s;uper&s;titions and idolatry of the hea|then, let us glance at the &s;ublime de&s;cription of this noble animal, contained in the &s;acred writings. God, to humble the haughtine&s;s of Job, and to bring him to a more &s;olemn con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the di|vine wi&s;dom and power in creation, thus addre&s;&s;eth him: <HI>Ha&s;t thou given the hor&s;e &s;trength? Ha&s;t thou cloathed his neck with thunder? Can&s;t thou make him afraid as a gra&s;s-hopper? The glory of his no&s;trils is terrible. He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his &s;trength: he go|eth on to meet the armed men. He mocketh at fear, and is affrighted; neither turneth he back from the &s;word. The quiver rattleth again&s;t him, the glittering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and the &s;hield. He &s;walloweth the ground with fiercene&s;s and rage; neither believeth he that it is the &s;ound of the trumpet. He &s;aith among the trumpets, ha, ha, and he &s;melleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the &s;houtings.</HI> Job xxxix. 19&mdash;25.</P>
<P>The callous, impenitent heart of the Jews, re|gardle&s;s of the evil and the con&s;equences of &s;in, are &s;aid to be as <HI>the hor&s;e that ru&s;heth into the battle.</HI> Jer. viii. 6. Equally as thoughtle&s;s are tho&s;e who precipitately ru&s;h before God in prayer, without realizing the infinite maje&s;ty of Jehovah; feeling the wretchedne&s;s of their depraved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ture, and con|fiding

in a Mediator for acceptance. And, although the real chri&s;tian may &s;entimentally accord in the ju&s;tne&s;s of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, in too many in|&s;tances, as it relates to his walk with God, his &s;e|cular concerns in the world, and in his public pro|fe&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel, he may too often find him&s;elf guilty, and lament his precipitance.</P>
<P>It is not improper, in this place, to introduce the tran&s;lation of Elijah to heaven in a <HI>chariot of fire,</HI> and by <HI>hor&s;es of fire.</HI> 2 Kings ii. 11. This ce|le&s;tial vehicle might be a conflux of exhalations or clouds, formed in this likene&s;s by a &s;upernatural power; and, by the &s;olar rays &s;triking on them, might appear fiery and red; much in the &s;ame manner as our Lord him&s;elf was taken up in a cloud. Acts i. 9. This idea on the chariot and hor&s;es of fire is con&s;iderably &s;upported by the lat|ter clau&s;e of the ver&s;e: <HI>and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</HI>&mdash;The mode of Elijah's conveyance to heaven has, however, been more generally con&s;idered to have been by the mini&s;try of Angels, whom <HI>God maketh a flame of fire.</HI> P&s;m. civ. 4. <HI>The chariots of God are twenty thou&s;and, even thou&s;ands of Angels.</HI> P&s;m. lxviii. 17.

therefore, to &s;how how de&s;irous they were of his company, they would come and fetch him. The chariot and hor&s;es appeared like fire, not for burn|ing, but brightne&s;s; not to torture and con&s;ume, but to render his a&s;cen&s;ion con&s;picuous and illu&s;trious in the eyes of tho&s;e who &s;tood afar off to view it.

<P>The &s;pou&s;e, the church of Chri&s;t, are compared to a <HI>company of hor&s;es in Pharoah's chariot;</HI> Sol.

It is to be con|fe&s;&s;ed, that the credit and the comfort of religion de|pend very much upon a &s;teady profe&s;&s;ion; <HI>if ye love me, keep my commandments.</HI> The pre&s;ent age of chri&s;tianity is attended with too great an indifference to the po&s;itive precepts of the go&s;pel, and the ordi|nance which Chri&s;t hath graciou&s;ly appointed in his church; and I cannot but con&s;ider that, among the many baneful con&s;equences of &s;uch un&s;tead|fa&s;tne&s;s, is the triumph of infidelity.

Remember your crimes are &s;uch as admit not the &s;hadow of reparation; you cannot re&s;tore the <HI>life</HI> you have taken; you cannot place the <HI>hu&s;band</HI> in the <HI>widow'</HI>s arms; give to the numerous <HI>children</HI> their lo&s;t <HI>father,</HI> nor bring back the <HI>citizen</HI> to <HI>&s;ociety.</HI> No; neither can you offer re&s;titution to the law of nature, and the law of man, for un|provoked murder, which peremptorily demands BLOOD FOR BLOOD!! How &s;erious, how di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing is your ca&s;e! Were there no God; were there no divine law to bind you to the authority of HIM who made you; were there no futurity, no puni&s;hment beyond the vale of death, your &s;tate demands &s;erious reflection, and con&s;cious grief.</P>
<P>But, my fellow mortal, ten thou&s;and evidences pronounce the exi&s;tence of an independent, holy, righteous BEING; the fir&s;t cau&s;e, and the la&s;t end of all things; and to whom <HI>you</HI> and <HI>I</HI> are equally amenable. This throws a &s;till more &s;olemn &s;hade
<PB N="81" REF="038552_0083_101258E56C5D6048">
upon you. The providence of this unerring God now &s;urrounds you, as with a net of iron, and binds you over unto death. The hand of this God is upon you: O that you may feel it, producing conviction and repentance. Attempt not to &s;tifle conviction of your accountability to God. Re|member one conviction of con&s;cience; the lea&s;t &s;truggle again&s;t the powers of death not only indi|cates eternity to man, but pronounces, in loud ac|cents, the certainty of a judgment to come, and to which you are now ha&s;tening. The &s;ins you have committed are not again&s;t your own &s;pecies <HI>only,</HI> but again&s;t the God who made you. Dare you &s;ay the man whom you murdered was not a creature of the Almighty, brought into exi&s;tence, nouri&s;hed, &s;upported by HIM? If &s;o, was it not an high offence again&s;t that God, intentionally and violently to deprive his creature of life; thereby defacing the divine workman&s;hip, and attempting to overturn the government of your God? Was not this taking the right of government into your own hand, and as much as to &s;ay, the life of the man was at your di&s;po&s;al? That God again&s;t whom you have &s;inned, has declared, <HI>Who&s;o &s;heddeth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed; for in the image of God made he man.</HI> Gen. ix. 6. And, you know, Sir, this precept has
<PB N="82" REF="038552_0084_101258E7090A7FB8">
been &s;olemnly obeyed by all civilized nations for &s;ome thou&s;and years. You cannot be di&s;po&s;ed to controvert another &s;entence &s;elected from the &s;ame ancient records, <HI>That no murderer hath eter|nal life abiding in him.</HI> 1 John iii. 15. For, had you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the fear of the Lord, you dur&s;t not have committed the foul offence. No, you follow|ed the cultivated, wicked propen&s;ities of your own heart, and cheri&s;hed the temptations of the devil, therefore you awfully fell. May God &s;olemnize your brea&s;t, and make you feel and lament your ca&s;e! Condemned by the laws of God and man, death with horror awaiting you; the doors of eternity unfolding to receive you; and the incon|ceivable &s;olemn tribunal of Jehovah prepared for your final appearance! The &s;entence, O how &s;hall I tran&s;cribe it! <HI>Murderers &s;hall have their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brim|&s;tone, which is the &s;econd death.</HI> Rev. xxi. 8.</P>
<P>My dear Sir, con&s;true not this faithful e&s;timate of your ca&s;e as intended to in&s;ult your wretched|ne&s;s. Far from it; I feel for you, and wi&s;h you to feel for your&s;elf. Great &s;ins need great convic|tion, and great repentance. Think &s;eriou&s;ly of your &s;tate. The hardened, the abandoned alone would &s;tifle reflection at &s;uch a time as yours. I have read of a felon who laughed at the fate of
<PB N="83" REF="038552_0085_101258E8A1A78E08">
the gallows; but, when the officer advanced to mea&s;ure him for a <HI>coffin,</HI> he trembled, turned pale, and wept.</P>
<P>But &s;hall I aid your reflection, to realize your guilt, and not tell you of a pardon? Shall I open the gha&s;tly wound in your brea&s;t, and not point to you an adequate balm? True, the law of your country cannot &s;ave you; the law of nature con|demns you; no mortal can pluck you from the jaws of de&s;truction: yet, there is an hand able and mighty to &s;ave; there is a pardon adequate to your offence; there is a balm &s;ufficient to heal&mdash;JESUS, the Son of God, died for men&mdash;for &s;inners&mdash;for his very <HI>murderers;</HI> and, as recorded in Acts ii. three thou&s;and Jews, acce&s;&s;ary to the death of Chri&s;t, were brought to conviction, repentance, and &s;alvation, through the very blood which they had &s;hed! Surprizing mercy! rich grace! To that Saviour I direct you; he of whom you have had little thought, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> not de&s;pi&s;ed; that Saviour alone can pardon, heal, and &s;ave you. <HI>His blood clean&s;|eth from all &s;in.</HI> 1 John. i. 7. The&s;e are the en|viting accents of his lips, <HI>Come, unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t.</HI> Mat. xi. 28. <HI>Him that cometh unto me I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI> John. vi. 37. Thus may you find that mercy in Chri&s;t which you
<PB N="84" REF="038552_0086_101258EA593B2310">
cannot receive from man! May your death, though awful in it&s;elf, be accompanied with acknowledg|ments to man, and a pardon &s;ealed upon your con|&s;cience, by your Lord and Judge! With him I leave you, and &s;hall follow this addre&s;s with my private and public prayers, that you may prove <HI>a brand plucked from the burning.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBITUARY.</HEAD>
<P>ON Lord's-day evening, October 29, 1797, died the Rev. CHRISTOPHER GODFEY PETER, min|i&s;ter of the Moravian Church, in New-York.</P>
<P>Mr. Peter was born <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Gre&s;low, Lower Sili&s;ia, in the dominions of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. His fa|ther was a phy&s;ician; and Mr. Peter enjoyed the affectionate care of his parents until the &s;eventh year of his age; at which time he lo&s;t his mother by death. His father's &s;econd marriage proved to Mr. Peter a &s;ource of di&s;quietude, as his &s;tep-mo|ther was to him &s;o inattentive as to induce his fa|ther to place him at a di&s;tant &s;eminary, for his edu|cation; where he abode with excellent moral repu|tation till his &s;ixteenth year, when he underwent the affliction of his father's death. Mr. Peter en|tered the univer&s;ity of Konig&s;berg, where he pur|&s;ued his &s;tudies until his nineteenth year, and then was admitted a preacher in the Lutheran church. After preaching &s;ome time among this denomina|tion, he, with &s;everal other young mini&s;ters, were brought under very &s;evere exerci&s;es of mind, lea&s;t they &s;hould profe&s;&s;edly have preached to others; while their own &s;ouls were de&s;titute of <HI>the one
<PB N="94" REF="038552_0096_10125900F07BB670">
thing needful.</HI> While in this &s;tate of painful &s;en|&s;ibility, they heard of the Rev. Augu&s;tus Gottlieb Spangenberg, a very aged, venerable mini&s;ter of the United Brethren, or Moravian Church: to him they repaired, and from his lips they were inform|ed, "that if ever their burthens were removed, and their &s;ouls made happy, it mu&s;t be by a believing &s;ight of a dear, crucified Redeemer, and who mu&s;t be to them their <HI>all, and in all.</HI>" Relief was conveyed to their hearts: they found happine&s;s by believing in Chri&s;t; and, through their connection with this venerable mini&s;ter, they gave the princi|ples of the Moravian Church an inve&s;tigation, en|tered as members, and, in due time, were appoint|ed to the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>In the year 1786 Mr. Peter received a call to England, and took up his re&s;idence at Fulneck, in York&s;hire, as a mini&s;ter, and a teacher of lan|guages. Augu&s;t 12, 1791, he entered into mar|riage with Mi&s;s Sarah Bailey, his pre&s;ent mourning relict, by whom he had two children, now living. In the &s;ame year he came to America, and was or|dained by the Rev. Andrew Huebner, Bi&s;hop of the Moravian Church, and then re&s;ided for &s;ome|time at Hebron, exerci&s;ing his mini&s;terial office. October, 1793, he was &s;tationed with the Moravian Church in this city; where, with the approbation
<PB N="95" REF="038552_0097_101259036C748228">
and joy of his church, he affectionately di&s;charged the duties of his mini&s;try, until the Lord removed him by death.</P>
<P>The manner, and the &s;ucce&s;s attending the la|bours of Mr. Peter, I leave to the more competent deci&s;ion of the people of his charge. As my con|nection with him, as a friend, commenced &s;oon after his &s;ettlement in New-York, and, though of a different religious denomination to my&s;elf, having enjoyed in him, to the moment of his death, the &s;weets of friend&s;hip, this OBITUARY is compo&s;ed by the EDITOR, as a &s;mall te&s;timony of his e&s;teem for Mr. Peter.</P>
<P>Never, perhaps, did a man &s;u&s;tain a literary, or mini&s;terial character, with greater undi&s;&s;embl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d humanity. His bowels yearned over the mi&s;eries of the poor; and in one in&s;tance, known to my&s;elf, he could give him&s;elf no re&s;t until he procured re|lief for a nece&s;&s;itous family. Great was his de&s;ire for the &s;pread of the go&s;pel throughout the world, and often he would expre&s;s his wi&s;h, if the Lord plea&s;ed, to preach to the unenlightened heathen. Every good man, of every religious denomination, found a place in his heart. This city is indebted to Mr. Peter, as a u&s;eful man. He was one of the fir&s;t who meditated the plan, and was zealou&s;ly engaged in e&s;tabli&s;hing the pre&s;ent exi&s;ting &s;ociety,
<PB N="96" REF="038552_0098_10125905EEFAB3F0">
entitled, "The New-York Society for Promoting Chri&s;tian Knowledge and Piety among the Poor, by the Gift of Bibles and other Religious Books."</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t u&s;eful life mu&s;t have an end. On the clo&s;e of the la&s;t year, he &s;eemed to have &s;ome forebodings, that he &s;hould &s;oon drop his clay. Nature gradually appeared to break away; but, it was vi&s;ible to tho&s;e around him, that he was often indulged in &s;weet communion with his Lord. His pillow appearing wet, it was &s;oon di&s;covered to be with his own tears. On being a&s;ked the cau&s;e of his grief, he replied, "No|thing grieved him; he was only enjoying nearne&s;s to his dear Saviour; that he could lay him&s;elf, his wife, his children, and the church upon his dear Redeemer's heart." At la&s;t, upon that heart he died, in &s;erene &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and expre&s;&s;ive hope, that his &s;oul &s;hould meet his Lord in realms of endle&s;s bli&s;s!</P>
<P>Mr. Peter was cut down in the prime of his days, being only in the thirty-&s;eventh year and fourth month of his age. Mrs. Peter, with her two infants, retired to Bethlehem, where the benevo|lence of the United Brethren have provided a hou&s;e and every agreeable accommodation, for the recep|tion of their mini&s;ters' widows and children. An expre&s;&s;ion this of chri&s;tian love, highly worthy the imitation of every religious denomination.</P>

<P>I. It is pure, cele&s;tial light&mdash;a light from hea|ven.

which cau&s;ed the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, hath &s;hined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> 2 Cor. iv. 6.

Many years had he philo&s;ophically contemplated the maje&s;ty and glory of the &s;un in the firmament, and its light &s;hone upon his natural path: but here is a light falling round him of a different, more brilliant, penetrating nature&mdash;a &s;upernatural, cele&s;tial light, unknown to him before&mdash;the ri&s;ing of Je&s;us, <HI>the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, with healing in his beams,</HI> to create a new day of mercy upon his &s;oul. This event, Paul informs us, took place <HI>at mid-day.</HI> How tran&s;cendently great mu&s;t have been the ap|pearance of Je&s;us, to ca&s;t the meridian &s;un into a &s;hade!

&s;hining on the dark chaos of nature, to produce the beauties and riches of creation, but faintly re|&s;embles the &s;uperior light of grace, falling upon the dark, depraved &s;oul of Saul of Tar&s;us, to pro|duce the beauties of virtue and true holine&s;s! In this light he &s;aw him&s;elf, his Saviour and his God; and, from this light upon his mind, he afterwards wrote and preached to others. Not Paul alone, but all who &s;et in darkne&s;s, and in the &s;hadow of death, need to receive this light, to guide them to everla&s;ting peace. This heavenly light di&s;covers to us the evil of our corrupt natures: we &s;ee the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of our pa&s;t lives in a new and con|vincing manner: the law of God, in its &s;pirituality, extent, demands, and inflexibility, appears in its augu&s;t glory! and in this heavenly light we behold, through the written word, the torments of hell! Happy for the &s;inner, that this light never falls upon his heart, to &s;how him his danger, and then to leave him to peri&s;h. No: it guides him into the way of &s;alvation in Chri&s;t, as worthy of God, as it is &s;uited to his own &s;oul. <HI>I am the way, the truth and the life,</HI> &s;aith the Lord: <HI>no man cometh to the Father but by me.</HI> John xiv. 6.

What delight to a believing &s;oul, to call to remembrance the days of illumination&mdash;the happy re&s;urrection morn to his &s;oul, when Je&s;us, the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, aro&s;e and &s;hone upon him! It was, indeed, <HI>as the light of the morning when the &s;un ri&s;eth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender gra&s;s, &s;pringing out of the earth by clear &s;hining, after rain.</HI> 2 Sam. xxiii. 4. Glory be to GOD MOST HIGH, for &s;ending forth this heavenly light to fall upon any &s;inner's heart! and glory be the riches of God's grace, if the writer and the reader can &s;ay, <HI>He hath delivered us from the power of darkne&s;s, into the kingdom of his dear Son!</HI> Col. i. 13.</P>
<P N="2">2. The light of Chri&s;t is attractive. <HI>I am the light of the world: he that followeth me &s;hall not walk in darkne&s;s, but &s;hall have the light of life.</HI> John viii. 12. <HI>They looked unto him, and were lightened; and their faces were not a&s;ham|ed.</HI> P&s;a. xxxiv. 5. <HI>In thy light &s;hall we &s;ee light.</HI> P&s;a. xxxvi. 9.

equally opens to receive the genial, animating rays of THE SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, and mo&s;t cheerfully follows him in all his holy ways. Nothing will &s;piritually engage the heart of man, but the &s;hining of the light of Chri&s;t! Mini&s;ters, with their various gifts, may plea&s;e, and engage the attention of the hearers; but, after all, they are but as the branches of a &s;preading tree, through which the light of life mu&s;t &s;hine, to quicken and attract the &s;ouls beneath. The poor cottager, though clothed in rags, yet enriched with grace, may receive the attraction of Chri&s;t's light, as the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed monarch upon earth, with a &s;tar upon his brea&s;t. So free are the rays of Chri&s;t's love and grace to his people! Generally we find more &s;en&s;ibility and happine&s;s, in Chri&s;t, beneath the poor man's tent, than in the rich man's palace.</P>
<P N="3">3. The light of life, in Chri&s;t, is real. It is ex|pre&s;&s;ly called <HI>the true light,</HI> John i. 9. in oppo&s;i|tion to the fal&s;e lights of depraved rea&s;on&mdash;the doctrines of carnal men&mdash;to the morality of hea|then&mdash;and to vain &s;uper&s;tition: e&s;pecially as being the rever&s;e to our native fal&s;e light, by which we were guided into erroneous notions of God, Chri&s;t, &s;in, grace, heaven, and hell. It is no phantom or airy imagination&mdash;no heated enthu&s;i|a&s;m&mdash;
<PB N="103" REF="038552_0105_101259168CC034B8">
but &s;incere, &s;olid, heavenly, and divine; ne|ver re&s;ting &s;hort of communion with God, as the centre of joy in the &s;oul! Its truth is evident from its own purity; leading the &s;ubject of it from the practice of &s;in to the love of holine&s;s. It never did, nor can, deceive the &s;oul on which it &s;hines. It as clearly di&s;covers to a man's &s;oul the nature and permanency of his intere&s;t in Chri&s;t&mdash;his right to the rich trea&s;ure of grace&mdash;and to a bli&s;s|ful immortality&mdash;as the light of the natural &s;un di&s;covers the objects around us, of which we have no doubt nor he&s;itation. From this certain hea|venly light &s;hining upon the heart, Paul could only &s;ay, <HI>I know in whom I have believed.</HI> 2 Tim. i. 12. <HI>I am per&s;uaded that neither death nor life</HI> (with all their attendant &s;ufferings) <HI>&s;hall never &s;eparate me from the love of God which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> Rom. viii. 38, 39. Since, therefore, this illumination is &s;o great a privilege, and &s;o rich a ble&s;&s;ing, never let us re&s;t until the <HI>Lord lift up upon us the light of his countenance, and be gracious unto us!</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. We may, therefore, add, in the language of the preacher, <HI>Truly light is &s;weet, and a plea&s;ant thing it is for the eyes to behold the &s;un.</HI> Ecc. xi. 7. The young man born blind, cured by Chri&s;t, and poor Bartimeus, healed through the &s;ame means,
<PB N="104" REF="038552_0106_10125919EA9AF798">
could well atte&s;t the truth of this remark. To re|ceive &s;uch a cure naturally is a great ble&s;&s;ing; but to have the eyes of the &s;oul opened is infinitely greater! No words can convey a &s;atisfactory idea of light to a blind man: but when the eyes are opened, there needs no words to de&s;cribe; it bears its own evidence. We may talk of the ex|cellent properties of the light of Chri&s;t to carnal minds, but they cannot under&s;tand: <HI>they love dark|ne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds are evil:</HI> but no &s;ooner are the eyes of a &s;inner opened, than the light of Chri&s;t, bringing &s;alvation to his heart, makes it both <HI>&s;weet and plea&s;ant.</HI> To contem|plate the per&s;on, office, and glory of Chri&s;t, in the light of life&mdash;to feel this heavenly light &s;o beaming upon the heart as to draw forth heavenly de&s;ires, hopes and affections&mdash;what can make us &s;o happy while on earth?</P>
<P>To conclude this e&s;&s;ay, let us examine if this light has ever vi&s;ited our hearts. Night and day are not greater oppo&s;ites in the natural world, than a &s;tate of unregeneracy and grace are in the moral world. If ever you have been made <HI>light in the Lord,</HI> you mu&s;t certainly remember, that <HI>you were &s;ome time darkne&s;s.</HI> Eph. v. 8. Should you be &s;en&s;ible of your blindne&s;s, and, like Bartimeus, &s;et by the high-way &s;ide, begging&mdash;<HI>Lord that I may
<PB N="105" REF="038552_0107_1012591B884D7530">
receive my &s;ight,</HI> you may take encouragement; for none that ever cried to Je&s;us were unan&s;wered; none that ever came to him were ca&s;t out. Or, &s;hould the reader, after many years enjoyment of the light of Chri&s;t, have lo&s;t the comfort of it, and, like Job, <HI>go mourning without the &s;un,</HI> Job xxx. 28. remember that &s;ome intervening cloud, from the corruption of your heart or the errors of your life, has deprived you of your privilege. <HI>In God is no darkne&s;s at all.</HI> 1 John i. 5. It comes from your&s;elf. Try to &s;earch your hearts, and mourn over the cau&s;e. Remember, <HI>Darkne&s;s may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morn|ing.</HI> That grace which God hath planted in your heart will nor let you re&s;t as you are, nor let go your hope in Chri&s;t as the light of your &s;oul. With the amiable Mrs. Rowe, you can &s;ay,
<Q><L>He is my Sun, though he refu&s;e to &s;hine;</L>
<L>Though, for a moment, he depart,</L>
<L>I dwell for ever on his heart,</L>

<HI>Why then art thou ca&s;t down, O my &s;oul, and why art thou di&s;quieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I &s;hall yet prai&s;e him for the help of his countenance.</HI> P&s;a. xlii. 5.</P>

heart, and &s;o plea&s;ant to the eyes, in this earthly &s;tate, where we have &s;o many intervening clouds, &s;uch dark and dreary days, and &s;uch &s;torms and tempe&s;ts to fill our &s;kies;&mdash;what joy and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s may we not cheerfully hope to enjoy when tran&s;|mitted to immortality! where every tint of iniquity is done away; where no &s;orrow enters; and where GOD and the LAMB become the eternal LIGHT of the ble&s;&s;ed!

<HEAD>ANECDOTE.</HEAD>
<P>A MERCHANT of Antwerp, named JOHN DEANS, having lent &s;ome millions of money to the Emperor Charles the fifth, begged him to do him the honour of coming to dine with him. The Emperor, loth to refu&s;e on account of the obliga|tion under which he was, accepted the offer, and went to his hou&s;e at the time appointed. The mer|chant &s;pared nothing to gratify his royal gue&s;t; and, animated with a genero&s;ity rarely to be met with, cau&s;ed fire to be &s;et to a pile of cinnamon; and, taking the bond which his maje&s;ty had given him as a &s;ecurity for his money, threw it into the flames, &s;aying, SIRE, YOU ARE NOW OUT OF

MY DEBT. Could the Emperor ever have forgot|ten &s;uch an unexpected, unprecedented act of friend&s;hip? Impo&s;&s;ible!</P>
<P>Much le&s;s po&s;&s;ible is it for that man who truly knows the LORD JESUS CHRIST, to forget his unparalleled kindne&s;s and un&s;earchable grace! Va&s;t the debt we have contracted&mdash;infinite in number and malignity, by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the good law of our ALMIGHTY CREATOR. Yet &s;uch was the conde&s;cen&s;ion and a&s;toni&s;hing love of JESUS, that he willingly offered his own body and &s;oul, infi|nitely more precious than all the &s;pices of the ea&s;t to the fire of Divine anger, to obliterate the bond of our obligation unto God! Or, as the apo&s;tle charmingly expre&s;&s;es this amazing tran&s;action&mdash;<HI>Blotting out the hand-writing of ordinances that was again&s;t us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cro&s;s; and having &s;poiled principalities and powers, he made a &s;hew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</HI> Col. ii. 14, 15.</P>
<P>With what a&s;toni&s;hment mu&s;t the Emperor have beheld the a&s;hes of his con&s;umed obligation! How free the royal brea&s;t from this va&s;t debt! Who now, therefor, can make a &s;econd claim? Yet, &s;till greater amazement, and more &s;olid peace, may po&s;&s;e&s;s our &s;ouls, while beholding Je&s;us cancelling

Only the <HI>a&s;hes</HI>&mdash;the a&s;hes of our corrupt, fallen, di&s;abled nature, remains; and this purpo&s;ely to remind us, in time, of what our Saviour hath done; &s;o that, <HI>in tho&s;e days, and in that time, &s;aith the Lord, the ini|quity of I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;ought for, and there &s;hall be none; and the &s;ins of Judah, and they &s;hall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I re&s;erve.</HI> Jer. 1. 20.</P>

<HEAD>An&s;wer to the Query propo&s;ed in our la&s;t Number, page 84, by D. H. "Whether Adam, in his Primitive State, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Grace of Faith." We offer the following Ob&s;ervations.</HEAD>
<P>IF by "the grace of faith," that <HI>faith</HI> be intend|ed which the go&s;pel defines&mdash;<HI>the fruit of the Spi|rit,</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="038552_0111_1012592582F48FB0">
Gal. v. 22. <HI>which is obtained through the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>&mdash;2 Pet. i. 1. is connected with, and demon|&s;trative of, the <HI>&s;alvation</HI> of the &s;oul, as the free, unconditional, gracious gift of God&mdash;Eph. ii. 8. if this <HI>faith</HI> is intended, then we are of opinion that Adam, in his primitive &s;tate, had it not. Adam then was in a &s;tate of moral purity; he had not &s;inned; nor does it appear that he had the fore|knowledge of his fall by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; con&s;e|quently, he &s;tood in no need of that faith which embraces a &s;aviour, nor the experience of go&s;pel grace which is revealed to the &s;en&s;ibly guilty and condemned; however, it might have been in &s;ecret coun&s;el with God, prepared for him.</P>
<P>If by the "grace of faith," is only meant Adam's confidence in God's promi&s;e for his pre|&s;ervation and &s;upply, we mu&s;t accord generally with that opinion. Such &s;ort of faith, or tru&s;t, we con&s;ider as a con&s;tituent part in the moral con|&s;titution of our fir&s;t parents; and by which they walked with God, and enjoyed the mo&s;t delightful &s;atisfaction in the productions of Eden. Without this faith, we cannot believe infinite wi&s;dom would have pronounced his workman&s;hip of humanity, <HI>very good.</HI></P>
<P>We cannot, however, but con&s;ider it injudicious
<PB N="110" REF="038552_0112_1012592835819DD8">
to call Adam's faith, the "grace of faith;" the term being un&s;criptural, and tending to confound the two great and glorious di&s;pen&s;ations of nature and of grace. While Adam was in Paradi&s;e, he knew God only as God of univer&s;al nature, and enjoyed him in that relation. That which our corre&s;pondent D. H. denominates "the grace of faith," is certainly a ble&s;&s;ing which flows from a new con&s;titution of things, founded upon the cove|nant of grace, and forms a material part of the <HI>new creature in Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> by which the &s;aved &s;inner enjoys God as his everla&s;ting father in Chri&s;t, the fruit of adopting grace and love.</P>
<P>After Adam's recovery, we believe that he had pure go&s;pel faith in Chri&s;t, the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah; the &s;eed of the woman, who &s;hould brui&s;e the &s;er|pent's head. Gen. iii. And, that his &s;ub&s;equent walk with God, his wor&s;hip by &s;acrifice, his general obedience, was as fully centered in Chri&s;t's future atonement and &s;atisfaction, as did the faith of Paul, Peter, John, or any &s;ubject of converting grace, in any period of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>The difference, therefore, of the&s;e two &s;orts of faith, cannot be too accurately marked; the one of nature, the other of grace; one pertaining to a pure, &s;inle&s;s creature, the other to &s;uch as are re|&s;tored by regenerating, converting, per&s;evering

grace. We hope, therefore, that the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions may be in&s;tructive to our readers, and to D. H. in particular.</P>

THE STAG,</HEAD>
<P>OR dear, <HI>Cervus,</HI> in tetrapodology, is the name of a genus of animals, the characters of which are like tho&s;e of the goat kind; they chew the cud; but they differ in this, that they &s;hed their horns, which are internally &s;olid, every year. If we
<PB N="112" REF="038552_0114_1012592E2FB086D0">
con&s;ider their &s;tructure, and compare them with the goat or the ox, we &s;hall find, what will at fir&s;t appear &s;trange, that they more re&s;emble the latter than the former. The ox and the &s;tag differ rather in their gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and &s;lenderne&s;s, than in any other anatomical di&s;tinction: the &s;keleton of either is nearly alike; the internal conformation is nearly the &s;ame; except that the deer kind want the gall-bladder; their kidneys are al&s;o formed dif|ferently; and their &s;pleen is proportionably larger. Such are the &s;light internal di&s;criminations between two animals, one of which is among the &s;wifte&s;t, and the other among the heavie&s;t of the brute cre|ation. The &s;tag is one of tho&s;e innocent animals which nature has made to embelli&s;h the park, and animate the &s;olitude of the grove. Its colour is, generally, of a reddi&s;h brown; but differs accord|ing to the climate he inhabits. The &s;tag has the mo&s;t beautiful eye; and his &s;en&s;es of &s;melling and hearing, are in no le&s;s perfection. Should a per|&s;on, at &s;ome di&s;tance, whi&s;tle, or call aloud, the &s;tag &s;tops &s;hort immediately in his &s;low pace, and gazes on the intruder; and if he perceives neither dogs nor any in&s;trument of de&s;truction levelled at him, he then proceeds forward without any emo|tion of fear. Man, indeed, is not the enemy he is mo&s;t afraid of; on the contrary, the &s;ound of the
<PB N="113" REF="038552_0115_1012592FCEB916B8">
&s;hepherd's pipe &s;eems to in&s;pire him with delight; and the hunters &s;ometimes make u&s;e of that in&s;tru|ment to allure the poor animal to his de&s;truction. This creature's voice is &s;tronger, louder, and more tremulous, in proportion as he advances in age. At &s;ome particular &s;ea&s;ons, the &s;tag is extremely wild and furious. Some years ago, William duke of Cumberland cau&s;ed a tyger and a &s;tag to be en|clo&s;ed in the &s;ame <HI>area,</HI> and the &s;tag made &s;o bold a defence, that the tyger was compelled to &s;ubmit. The &s;tag &s;eldom drinks in the winter, and &s;till le&s;s in the &s;pring, while the plants are tender and covered with dew. It is in the heat of &s;ummer that he is &s;een frequenting the &s;ides of rivers and lakes to quench his thir&s;t. He &s;wims with great ea&s;e and &s;trength, and be&s;t at tho&s;e times when he is fatte&s;t, his fat keeping him buoyant, like oil upon the &s;urface of the water. As the &s;tag is about five years coming to perfection, he lives above forty years; and it is a general rule that every animal lives about &s;even or eight times he number of years which it continues to grow. The horns of the &s;tag are greatly in u&s;e, and com|monly known by the name of hart&s;horn. It is calcined for &s;ome u&s;es, and made into a jelly for others. The marrow of the &s;tag is preferred to

that of any other animal to ea&s;e pain, and to &s;upple callous parts.</P>
<P>It is well known that this animal is devoted to the cha&s;e in almo&s;t every country; and generally forms a con&s;iderable part of the &s;port and pa&s;time of the noble and the great. The de&s;ertion of the cha&s;e has formed animated matter for the pens of the mo&s;t celebrated poets; and Mr. Hervey, the author of Theron and A&s;pa&s;io, has &s;o plea&s;ingly de&s;cribed the &s;cene, that we are di&s;po&s;ed to recite it particularly for the plea&s;ure of our young readers:</P>
<P>"The &s;tag, rou&s;ed from his lare, &s;hakes his dappled &s;ides; to&s;&s;es his beamy head; and, con|&s;cious of &s;uperior agility, &s;eems to defy the gather|ing &s;torm. Fir&s;t he has recour&s;e to &s;tratagem and eva&s;ive &s;hifts; he plunges into the cop&s;e; darts acro&s;s the glade; and wheels about in doubling mazes, as though he would pur&s;ue even the foe he avoids. The full-mouthed hounds unravel all his windings, and drive him from his wily arts. Now he betakes him&s;elf to flight, and confides in his &s;peed. He bur&s;ts through the woods; bounds over the lawns; and leaves the lagging beagles far be|hind. The beagles &s;low, but &s;ure, trace his &s;teps through woods, through lawns, through half the extended fore&s;t. Unwearied, &s;till unwearied, they
<PB N="115" REF="038552_0117_10125935167A5D30">
urge their ardent way, and gain upon the alarmed object of their pur&s;uit. Again he flies; flies with redoubled &s;wiftne&s;s; &s;hoots down the &s;teep; &s;trains up the hill; and takes &s;helter in the inmo&s;t rece&s;s of &s;ome &s;eque&s;tered grove. The &s;agacious hounds hang with greedy no&s;trils on the &s;cent: they re|cover, by indefatigable a&s;&s;iduity, the ground they had lo&s;t. Up they come a third time; and, join|ing in a general peal of vengeance, hurry the affrighted animal from his &s;hort concealment. Per|plexed, and in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, he &s;eeks the numerous herd. He would lo&s;e him&s;elf, and elude his pur&s;uers, amid&s;t the multitude of his fellows. But they, unconcerned for a brother's woe, &s;hun the mi&s;erable creature, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">xpel him from the &s;elfi&s;h circle. Abandoned by his a&s;&s;ociates, and haunted with apprehen&s;ions of approaching ruin, he trem|bles at every leaf that &s;hakes. He &s;tarts, he &s;prings, and, wild and &s;wift as the wind, flies he knows not where, yet pours out all his &s;oul in flight. Vain, vain are his efforts! The horrid cry, lately le&s;&s;ened, thickens upon the gale, and thunders in his ear. Now the poor, breathle&s;s victim is full in view. His &s;prightline&s;s for&s;akes him. His agility is &s;pent. See! how he toils in yonder val|ley, with faltering limbs and a hobbling gait. The &s;ight of their game quickens the pace, and

whets the ardour of the impetuous hounds. What can he do, &s;urrounded as he is with in&s;ulting tongues and ravenous jaws? De&s;pair is capable of in&s;piring even the timorous brea&s;t. Having nothing to hope, he forgets to fear. He faces about and makes a re&s;olute &s;tand. The trunk of a &s;turdy tree covers his rear, and his own branching horns defend him in front. He ru&s;hes upon his adver&s;aries; goars &s;ome; lays others grovelling on the turf; and makes the whole coward pack give way. Encouraged by this unexpected &s;ucce&s;s, his hopes revive. He rallies once again his drooping &s;pirits; exerts the little remainder of his &s;trength; and &s;prings through the mid&s;t of the retiring route. It is his la&s;t, la&s;t chance. He &s;tretches every nerve; once more lo&s;es &s;ight of the rabble from the kennel; and, finding no &s;ecurity on the land, takes to the water. He throws his burning &s;ides into the river; &s;ails down the cooling &s;tream; and &s;links away to the verge of &s;ome little &s;helving i&s;land; there, finding a re&s;ting-place for his feet, he &s;kulks clo&s;e to the &s;hady margin. All immer&s;ed in the waves, excepting only his no&s;trils, he baffles, for a while, the prying eye of man, and the keener &s;mell of brute. Di&s;covered at length, and forced to quit this unavailing refuge, he climbs the &s;lippery bank. Unable to fly any longer, he &s;tands at bay

again&s;t an aged willow. Stands, all faint with toil, and &s;obbing with angui&s;h. The crowds that gather round him, with mercile&s;s and outrageous tran&s;|port, triumph in his mi&s;ery. A multitude of blood|thir&s;ty throats, joined with the &s;onorous horn, ring his funeral knell. The tears, till this fatal in&s;tant unknown, gu&s;h from his langui&s;hing eyes, and roll down his reeking cheeks. He ca&s;ts one more look on the woods, the lawns, the plea&s;ing &s;cenes of his former delights; and, determined to die, pre|pares to &s;ell his life as dear as po&s;&s;ible. At this mo&s;t critical juncture, the <HI>royal</HI> &s;port&s;man comes up. He &s;ees the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed creature, and, as &s;oon as he &s;ees, he pities. He i&s;&s;ues his high command. The prohibitary &s;ignal is given. The pack, though raving for blood, are checked in a moment, and called off from the prey.

<HEAD>A SCRAP, Found in the Study of the late Rev. R. B.&mdash;.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;LAST Sabbath, a young man, newly brought to enjoy a Saviour's love, called upon me. Such a &s;erious cheerfulne&s;s and child-like &s;implicity appeared in him as won my heart, and made me recollect what I once felt, but feel not now. How &s;oon we &s;tep out of petticoats into breeches, and outgrow the charming child-like &s;implicity of the

new-birth! Either we become wi&s;e by knowledge, vain through our gifts, or important by our &s;tation. Self-&s;ufficiency creepeth upon us in&s;en&s;ibly, like the &s;hades of the evening, till we are quite over|whelmed by it; and the bloom of &s;implicity, like the bloom of a plumb when wiped off, is not to be recovered, at lea&s;t in its primitive blu&s;h. Many years have I been praying for a child-like &s;pirit; but did not know I was praying, or did not intend praying for a furnace of affliction to produce it! Well! I have been in the fire of tribulation &s;ix years, and have &s;carcely recovered a grain of chri&s;tian &s;implicity yet;&mdash;&s;ome little bloom appears upon the plumb, at times, but &s;eems more like the painter's &s;troke than the tint of nature. I preach again&s;t &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, and renounce it &s;tiffly in my creed, but trea&s;ure it up &s;ecretly in my bo&s;om. What a cheat and a rogue is a man to him&s;elf!

ancient prophets, no wonder &s;o many impo&s;tors &s;hould have ari&s;en, and laid claim to the office. Of this Je&s;us Chri&s;t forewarned his di&s;ciples:&mdash;<HI>There &s;hall ari&s;e fal&s;e chri&s;ts, and fal&s;e pro|phets, and &s;hall &s;hew great &s;igns and wonders; in|&s;omuch that (if it were po&s;&s;ible) they &s;hall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before.</HI> Mat. xxiv. 24, 25. The event has verified his pre|diction; and, to gratify our readers, we &s;hall, from the be&s;t authority, enumerate the chief of tho&s;e im|po&s;tors that have claimed the public attention!</P>
<P>SIMON, the &s;orcerer, &s;et him&s;elf forth, in the apo&s;tlic age, and by multitude, both of &s;mall and great, was acknowledged <HI>the great power of God;</HI> yet he &s;oon proved him&s;elf to be <HI>in the gall of bitterne&s;s, and in the bond of iniquity.</HI> Acts viii. In the following age, BARCHOCHEBAS, by his impo&s;tures, drew the mo&s;t terrible per&s;ecutions imaginable on the Jews: his name denotes <HI>Son of the Star,</HI> applying to him&s;elf the prophecy of Ba|laam. Numb. xxiv. 17. The number of Jews who peri&s;hed on account of this impo&s;tor is incre|dible!&mdash;In the fifth century, about the year 434, in the i&s;le of Candy, or Crete, appeared a fal&s;e Me&s;|&s;iah, called MOSES, pretending to be the ancient le|gi&s;lator of the Jews, come down from heaven to procure them a pa&s;&s;age through the &s;ea to Judea.
<PB N="134" REF="038552_0136_10125962A41D25D0">
Great numbers jumped into the &s;ea, expecting it would open and give them pa&s;&s;age. In this attempt many were drowned; after which the impo&s;tor di&s;|appeared. <HI>Socrat. Hi&s;t. Eccles.</HI>&mdash;In the following age, in the year 530, a fal&s;e Me&s;&s;iah, called JULIAN, appeared in Pale&s;tine: under him the Jews took up arms, but the emperor Ju&s;tinian &s;ending &s;ome troops again&s;t them, Julian was taken and executed, and his party di&s;per&s;ed. In 714, a Jew, called Serenus, pretended to the Spani&s;h Jews, that he would conduct them to Pale&s;tine; but they &s;oon found him to be an impo&s;tor. <HI>Marca Hi&s;t. de Bearn.</HI>&mdash;The twelfth century was very fruitful in impo&s;tors of this kind, there appearing no le&s;s than &s;even or eight in France, Spain, Per&s;ia, &amp;c. The la&s;t century produced a very famous in&s;tance: about the year 1666, one ZABATI TZEVI, a na|tive of Aleppo, or Smyrna, &s;et up for a Me&s;&s;iah. He was &s;ummoned before the heads of the &s;yna|gogue at Smyrna, and being convicted, was con|demned to death; but none could be found to exe|cute the &s;entence; he was therefore bani&s;hed; and, pa&s;&s;ing through Greece, came to Alexandria, from thence to Gaza, where he found a Jew, named Nathan Levi, whom he per&s;uaded to act the part of the prophet Elias. Many of the Jews were de|ceived. He afterwards came to Con&s;tantinople,
<PB N="135" REF="038552_0137_1012596520584DD0">
where he was apprehended, and ordered to be run through with a &s;word; to avoid which, he turned Mu&s;&s;ulman. <HI>Ba&s;nage's Hi&s;t. de Jui&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Some of our readers, probably, expect, in this enumeration, we &s;hould have named Mahomet, the pretended prophet of Arabia, who made his appear|ance in the year 622, but he lay no claim to the Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip, to the performance of miracles, nor to be a &s;ubject of the prophecies. He approved the prophetic character of JESUS CHRIST, as being extraordinary, and in his paradi&s;aical vi&s;ion is &s;aid to homage the SAVIOUR, though all other beings bowed to him. It is well known that Mahomet built his fabric upon the &s;uppo&s;ed nullity of the law of Mo&s;es, and the abu&s;e of the chri&s;tian religion by its profe&s;&s;ors; in con&s;equence of which, he &s;aid, <Q>God had &s;ent him into the world, and appointed him his prophet.</Q></P>
<P>May not believers on the Lord Chri&s;t, the Son of God, in every age exclaim, with the primitive di&s;ciples, <HI>We have found the Me&s;&s;iah, which is, being interpreted, the Chri&s;t.</HI> John i. 41. With the Bible in our hand, we may clearly perceive, that every feature predicted in the character of Me&s;|&s;iah&mdash;the fulne&s;s of time in which he &s;hould ap|pear&mdash;the miracles by which he &s;hould atte&s;t his mi&s;&s;ion&mdash;his grand de&s;ign in making an offering for

&s;in&mdash;his province to build the hou&s;e of the Lord, and to bear its glory&mdash;his ability to &s;ecure, in his own per&s;on, a triumphant re&s;urrection from the dead, with every ble&s;&s;ing, &s;piritual and eternal, that can form the moral happine&s;s of man. The&s;e great and glorious things are found in Je&s;us; none of which have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any before&mdash;none &s;ince his appearing. He is full of grace and truth, a &s;uitable Saviour for lo&s;t man; the experience of who&s;e ble&s;&s;ing attunes the heart, and lays a &s;olid ba&s;is for pre&s;ent peace and future glory!</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY On the LAW and the GOSPEL. By the Reverend SAMUEL JONES, D. D. Penn&s;ylvania.</HEAD>
<P>BETWEEN the Law and the Gospel there is both a connection and a material difference. The blending of the&s;e together, or treating them in an indi&s;tinct manner, has ever been a &s;ource of error. It is, therefore, the more nece&s;&s;ary to keep each of
<PB N="146" REF="038552_0148_10125981780C4058">
them in its proper place, e&s;pecially as a legal &s;pirit is &s;o natural to man, and &s;o difficult to be guarded again&s;t.</P>
<P>The difference between the Law and the Go&s;pel is very obvious. The Law denounces wrath&mdash;the Go&s;pel publi&s;hes peace. The Law convinces of guilt&mdash;the Go&s;pel brings an acquittance. The Law pronounces &s;entence&mdash;the Go&s;pel pre&s;ents a pardon. The Law requires &s;atisfaction to the la&s;t mite&mdash;the Go&s;pel announces &s;atisfaction made by Chri&s;t in full. The Law knows nothing of mercy&mdash;the Go&s;pel knows nothing el&s;e. In the Law righteou&s;ne&s;s, ju&s;tice, and truth, &s;hine gloriou&s;ly&mdash;in the Go&s;pel, love, grace, mercy, conde&s;cen&s;ion, and compa&s;&s;ion, &s;hine with much more re&s;plendent glory! In the Go&s;pel we find free grace, free mercy, free pardon, faith and repentance are freely given; and with them a new heart, a new nature, new life&mdash;all is new&mdash;all is free. The Go&s;pel, as the word &s;ignifies, is <HI>good me&s;&s;age, good news, glad tidings.</HI> The language of the Angels, at the birth of Chri&s;t, was, <HI>Behold! we bring you glad tidings of great joy.</HI> Luke ii. 10. The evangelic Prophet I&s;aiah, in that memorable pa&s;&s;age, applied by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord to him&s;elf and the go&s;|pel day, Luke iv. 18, 19. breaks out in the fol|lowing go&s;pel &s;train: <HI>The &s;pirit of the Lord
<PB N="147" REF="038552_0149_10125984D8EB70B8">
God is upon me, becau&s;e the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he hath &s;ent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the pri&s;on doors to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord; to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for a&s;hes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of prai&s;e for the &s;pirit of heavine&s;s.</HI> I&s;aiah lxi. 1&mdash;6.</P>
<P>The Go&s;pel is &s;ometimes called <HI>the Go&s;pel of the grace of God,</HI> Acts xx. 24. becau&s;e it pub|li&s;hes the rich grace and mercy of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. It is al&s;o called <HI>the Go&s;pel of &s;alvation,</HI> Eph. i. 13. Acts xiii. 26. becau&s;e it brings to light the way of life and &s;alvation, provided of God for lo&s;t, peri&s;hing &s;inners. Likewi&s;e, <HI>the Go&s;pel of peace,</HI> proclaiming peace, made by the peace-&s;peak|ing blood of Chri&s;t; diffu&s;ing peace and tranquilli|ty into depre&s;&s;ed minds; producing a peaceable di&s;|po&s;ition, conducting the feet in the paths of peace, and nurturing the &s;oul for the realms of peace and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in an eternal &s;tate!</P>
<P>The Go&s;pel brings glad tidings of good things,&mdash;good things done for us; atonement being made for us, our debt of &s;in fully paid, a righteou&s;ne&s;s wrought out, pardon and acceptance procured;
<PB N="148" REF="038552_0150_10125987987CE008">
good things wrought in us, regeneration, faith, hope; love, obedience, every grace habitually to prepare us for heaven; all the good things of Providence and grace that are nece&s;&s;ary for our pre&s;ent u&s;e, during our pa&s;&s;age through life, and, in their final i&s;&s;ue, the good things of heaven, the beatific &s;tate! The go&s;pel, therefore, is a di&s;covery of all good things for time, and for eternity; &s;uch infinite ble&s;&s;edne&s;s which is beyond what the tongues of angels and of men can expre&s;s, or the powers of the human mind conceive!</P>
<P>We add, the Go&s;pel is a matter of pure revela|tion from God, entirely unknown and imperceiva|ble by the light of nature. The revelation of this Go&s;pel has been progre&s;&s;ive in every age. The fir&s;t dawning of the Go&s;pel, con&s;equently the fir&s;t &s;olid ground of hope, appeared to Adam, in the promi&s;e that was made of <HI>the &s;eed of the woman who was to brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head.</HI> Gen. iii. 15. Here the eternal coun&s;els of the grace of God began to unfold! In the promi&s;e made to Abraham, which was afterwards renewed to I&s;aac and to Jacob, the &s;ame go&s;pel grace breaks forth with clearer light. What had before been &s;poken, in more general terms, of the &s;eed of <HI>the woman,</HI> is now &s;aid, in a more particular manner, of <HI>the &s;eed of Abraham.</HI> Gen. xxii. 18. To Jacob, the
<PB N="149" REF="038552_0151_10125989324ECCA8">
very time of accompli&s;hing the promi&s;e was pointed out. Gen. xlix. 10. Mo&s;es renders the promi&s;e &s;till more manife&s;t, while he points out a charac|ter and likene&s;s. Deut. xvii. 15. In the prophets, who were much further advanced in the di&s;pen&s;a|tion of the promi&s;es, approaching to the fulne&s;s of time, ha&s;tening to the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, you have his virgin mother, I&s;aiah vii. 5. place of birth, Micah v. 2. and other circum&s;tances pointed out. Thus we ob&s;erve the order and progre&s;s of the di|vine promi&s;es, gathering light and &s;trength as they advance. When the fir&s;t intimation of a Saviour was given, he was to be &s;ought for among all the human race; afterwards we are directed to the particular &s;eed of Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob; of Jacob's numerous &s;ons the tribe of Judah is taken; of the tribe of Judah the family of Je&s;&s;e; and of Je&s;&s;e's &s;ons the hou&s;e of David: thus reducing, as it were, to a point, what had at fir&s;t been delivered but in very general terms.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the leading and principal di&s;|coveries that were made to the world of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour before his incarnation. Thus did the pro|mi&s;es and the prophe&s;ies become brighter and brighter, until at la&s;t they &s;hone more clear in their full accompli&s;hments, when the &s;un of righteou&s;|ne&s;s ro&s;e, di&s;pelling darkne&s;s, and &s;preading the light of go&s;pel-day.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="038552_0152_1012598BAF540EF0">
The revelation of this Go&s;pel has been made known to &s;uch nations, and the application of it made to &s;uch individuals of tho&s;e nations, as it &s;eemed good to the will and plea&s;ure of God. <HI>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that &s;heweth mercy.</HI> Rom. ix. 16.</P>
<P>The application of the go&s;pel, under the influ|ence of the SPIRIT OF GOD, in the work of con|viction and conver&s;ion, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in order to our receiving <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> benefit from it. In this precious work of grace on the heart, the law, and the go&s;pel, <HI>as means,</HI> go hand in hand, and are often mentioned in the &s;ame ver&s;e. By the one is the knowledge of &s;in, by the other the di&s;covery of deliverance. The one worketh de&s;pair, the other faith and hope.</P>
<P>Thus, the glorious Go&s;pel, in every point of view, is the work of the rich and &s;overeign grace and mercy of God, that the plan of redemption was concerted, publi&s;hed, and applied to the elect, with all its &s;aving benefits. O the glorious and ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel! O the &s;overeign grace and mercy of God, in and through a precious Redeemer! to HIM be glory for ever and for ever&mdash;and let all the redeemed on earth and in heaven &s;ay, <HI>amen!</HI></P>

<HEAD>ANECDOTE OF PRESIDENT EDWARDS.</HEAD>
<P>PRESIDENT Edwards tells of him&s;elf the following anecdote.&mdash;I once told a boy of about thirteen years of age, that a piece of any matter of two inches &s;quare was eight times as big as a piece of one inch &s;quare. He &s;eemed, at fir&s;t, not to think me in earne&s;t; but when I had taken pains to convince him that I knew what I &s;aid to be true, he appeared a&s;toni&s;hed I was &s;o po&s;itive; and would argue, how is it po&s;&s;ible for two in|ches to be one inch. It &s;eemed to him to be as evident a contradiction as that that which was twice &s;o long, and twice &s;o broad, and twice &s;o thick, &s;hould be eight times as large, or that twice one &s;hould make eight, or any other ab&s;urdity whatever.</P>
<P>When I afterwards &s;hewed him the truth of it, by cutting out two cubes, one an inch, the other two inches &s;quare, and then cut the two inch cube into eight equal parts, he counted them over and over, and &s;eemed as a&s;toni&s;hed as though there had been &s;ome witchcraft in the ca&s;e; he could hardly believe it, for he was a &s;tranger to the rea&s;on.</P>

"I believe," adds that great man, "it was a much more difficult my&s;tery to him than the Trinity ordinarily is to men, and &s;eemed more palpably con|tradictory, than any doctrine of our religion to the Socinian and Dei&s;t. And why &s;hould we not &s;up|po&s;e that there may be &s;ome things that are true that may be as much above our under&s;tanding, and as difficult to them, as the truth re&s;pecting the cubes was to this boy? Doubtle&s;s there is a far greater difference between our under&s;tanding and God's, than between this boy's and the greate&s;t phi|lo&s;opher's or mathematician's."</P>

<Q><HI>&mdash;Then came Je&s;us, the doors being &s;hut, and &s;tood in the mid&s;t, and &s;aid, Peace be unto you.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THEN, after the &s;ufferings, crucifixion, death and burial of the Lord Je&s;us; when his di&s;ciples were depre&s;&s;ed by unbelief, and harra&s;&s;ed by their countrymen the Jews, being met together, the doors being &s;hut, Je&s;us came and &s;tood in the mid&s;t, and pronounced peace upon their waiting &s;ouls. May

the &s;ame adored Saviour meet with us, who now de&s;ire to meet with him at his own table! May he graciou&s;ly pronounce peace to every heart, and bid us go from &s;trength to &s;trength, till we &s;ee his face in brighte&s;t vi&s;ion in everla&s;ting bli&s;s!</P>
<P N="1">1. This was a &s;upernatural, miraculous vi&s;it. <HI>Je&s;us came, the doors being &s;hut;</HI> the account of which has given occa&s;ion to &s;ome to object to this part of &s;cripture hi&s;tory; becau&s;e it is a philo&s;ophical maxim, that one material body cannot penetrate another; con&s;equently the material body of Je&s;us could not pa&s;s through the material door unopened, and &s;o appear to his di&s;ciples. To this we reply, The body of Je&s;us, by death, was &s;own a natural body, but was rai&s;ed a &s;piritual body; con&s;equently materiality is ab&s;orbed in &s;pirit. And, as a proof of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this &s;pirituality, he eluded the em|brace of Mary, &s;aying, <HI>Touch me not yet, for I am not yet a&s;cended to my Father and your Father.</HI> Therefore we believe his &s;piritual body capable of &s;uch an extraordinary vi&s;it to his di&s;ciples.&mdash;The DIVINITY OF CHRIST gives us another ground to object to this dei&s;tical &s;entiment. <HI>Where two or three are met together in my name, there am I in the mid&s;t of them,</HI> &s;aid Je&s;us, as a proof of his omnipre&s;ence. This Saviour conver&s;ed with Abraham; with Mo&s;es in the burning bu&s;h; with
<PB N="154" REF="038552_0156_10125995B8D29D98">
the three worthies in the fiery furnace; and could as ea&s;ily conver&s;e with his di&s;ciples, as met together in &s;ecret for fear of the Jews. The reality of this vi&s;it is firmly and &s;olemnly believed by all who&s;e heart, like <HI>Lydia'</HI>s, the Lord hath opened. Admit that one material body cannot penetrate another&mdash;we apply this to the human heart, that no man, mini&s;ter or friend, can open the heart, and convey ble&s;&s;ings to another; yet Chri&s;t can, and doth; for he that made us can alone &s;ave us, and turn our hearts unto him&s;elf. A proof of this I pre&s;ume to believe is found in the brea&s;ts of many of my readers; carrying with it the cleare&s;t conviction of the eter|nal power and Godhead of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. This vi&s;it of Chri&s;t to his di&s;ciples was highly &s;ea&s;onable. They were per&s;ecuted by their brethren the Jews, and therefore &s;hut the doors, for fear, upon them&s;elves: and at this time they were har|ra&s;&s;ed with doubts and fears, "if Je&s;us was indeed the Chri&s;t." Full of de&s;pondency, they met to|gether, no doubt, to inquire into the reality of the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us, and of his being the Me&s;&s;iah that &s;hould redeem I&s;rael. Thomas, in an e&s;pecial manner, di&s;puted the ca&s;e, and would receive no &s;atisfaction. As it was with the&s;e primitive di&s;ci|ples &s;o it is frequently with the church and people of God in every age. Per&s;ecution, temptations,
<PB N="155" REF="038552_0157_1012599891A29A48">
doubts, fears, and a thou&s;and other evils, compa&s;s them about; and, if I may &s;o &s;ay, the door of hope appears to them &s;hut and barred. At &s;uch a time as this, &s;udden and unexpected, for Je&s;us to mani|fe&s;t him&s;elf to them, pronounce the charming words of peace, and make the place of his feet glorious: what an a&s;toni&s;hing alteration does it make in the feelings, views, language, and plea&s;ures of the happy company!</P>
<P N="3">3. This vi&s;it was particularly intended for con|firmation. They had doubted&mdash;they had que&s;tion|ed&mdash;if the crucified Je&s;us was indeed the Saviour, long foretold, and nece&s;&s;ary to be enjoyed. Thomas, one of the twelve, ab&s;ent at a former meeting with the di&s;ciples when Je&s;us came, would not believe, and &s;aid, "<HI>Except I &s;hall &s;ee in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of his nails, and thru&s;t my hand into his &s;ide, I will not believe.</HI>" The dear Saviour, knowing this de&s;pondent &s;pirit to po&s;&s;e&s;s his di&s;ci|ples, not waiting for the te&s;timony or inquiries of Thomas, thus unexpectedly addre&s;&s;ed him:&mdash;"<HI>Thomas, reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand and thru&s;t it into my &s;ide, and be not faithle&s;s, but believ|ing.</HI>" Inde&s;cribable mu&s;t be the feelings of Thomas at this addre&s;s! Self-aba&s;ed, convinced, and be|lieving,
<PB N="156" REF="038552_0158_1012599C2B73F660">
he now exclaims, "<HI>My Lord and my God!</HI>" Ju&s;t &s;o the Lord often &s;peaks to us at his table, bids us be familiar with his wounds, his blood, and his heart; then, O then we are a&s;ham|ed at our neglect and unbelief, prove his love and grace each day more healing, and a&s;cribe &s;alvation to his mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed name!</P>
<P N="4">4. Although Thomas, by rea&s;on of his extreme doubts, was particularly addre&s;&s;ed, yet, it is evi|dent that the vi&s;it was general&mdash;to one&mdash;to all. Je&s;us &s;aid unto them, <HI>Peace be unto you.</HI> They all had this addre&s;s before Thomas was &s;elected and brought to acknowledgment; con&s;equently, let their fears, hopes, duties, trials, di&s;tre&s;&s;es, temp|tations, and unbelief, be what they may, all heard the Saviour's voice, all received the peaceful ble&s;|&s;ing. In the &s;ame manner he meets his people now, and let their circum&s;tances be what they may, his loving heart, his watchful eye, his gracious hand, are &s;till the &s;ame, and upon all; rich and poor, young and old, lambs and &s;heep, all find a place beneath his &s;acred &s;miles!</P>
<P N="5">5. The vi&s;it was in a mea&s;ure permanent; it was not a pa&s;&s;ing by, but a &s;tanding &s;till. He <HI>&s;tood</HI> in the mid&s;t, &s;o every eye might &s;ee him, and all enjoy his gracious vi&s;it. And here, methinks, was no que&s;tioning one another, no calling Peter
<PB N="157" REF="038552_0159_1012599DC98C4A48">
to account for the denial of his Lord, no reproving John for his precipitance in calling down fire from heaven upon tho&s;e who followed not Je&s;us, nor re|proof to Thomas for his negligence and unbelief; but, every eye, every heart was engaged towards Chri&s;t, who was not only the centre of the com|pany, but the centre of their joy! Ju&s;t &s;o it is where Chri&s;t makes his vi&s;its and commands his love: all animo&s;ities vani&s;h; human frailties are forgotten; of one heart and of one &s;oul, they all embrace the precious Chri&s;t, who is the fountain of their mutual joy! This never fails to be the ca&s;e where a revival of religion is enjoyed.</P>
<P N="6">6. This vi&s;it was attended with benefits: Je&s;us pronounced peace unto them, and peace flowed into every heart! Peace is a term that comprehends every ble&s;&s;ing we can enjoy, and is peculiarly wel|come to us, who by nature are enemies to God, and need his pardon. Je&s;us obtained peace by the blood of his cro&s;s: having &s;atisfied for &s;in, he now has a right to &s;peak peace to the &s;inner's heart. O that each of us may hear and feel the bli&s;sful found!&mdash;There were no &s;uperfluous, unnece&s;&s;ary acts in the life of Chri&s;t; his feet went about doing good; his eyes were fixed with compa&s;&s;ion upon the wretched, and his hands con&s;tantly admini&s;tered relief: even when his ble&s;&s;ed hands were nailed
<PB N="158" REF="038552_0160_101259A0426B04C0">
open to the cro&s;s, they were filled with his own blood, which conveys the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;edne&s;s to guilty men.</P>
<P>The privilege of the&s;e di&s;ciples, in the enjoyment of &s;uch a vi&s;it from Chri&s;t, was certainly very great: they &s;aw the Lord, and their hearts were filled with joy: but, &s;ays the &s;ame divine Lord,&mdash;<HI>becau&s;e thou ha&s;t &s;een me thou ha&s;t believed: ble&s;&s;ed are they that have not &s;een, and yet have believed.</HI> V. 29. <HI>And the&s;e things are written, that we might believe that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, the Son of God, and that believing we might have life through his name.</HI> V. 31. Our privi|leges are greater than tho&s;e of the di&s;ciples: Je&s;us is now a&s;cended, and &s;et down at the Father's right hand, as a &s;ure pledge of our glorification in hea|ven.&mdash;Now the promi&s;ed Spirit is to us &s;ent down, and, under his influence, we know, love, and en|joy the Lord! May we live in the experience of the&s;e ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings; and may the repeated vi&s;its of Chri&s;t to us in his church below, be the delightful prelude to an eternal communion with him in the church triumphant above!</P>

<P>OUR corre&s;pondent, perhaps, is aware of cer|tain difficulties attending this remarkable pa&s;&s;age. Some have taken the liberty of rendering the words, <HI>What &s;hall they do who are baptized</HI> OVER <HI>the dead?</HI> "it being cu&s;tomary among the primitive chri&s;tians, to baptize converts over the graves of believing dead; e&s;pecially over the tombs of the martyrs." But the New Te&s;tament informs us of no &s;uch &s;ort of bapti&s;ms. If any had exi&s;ted, and intended for example, we &s;hould have been in|formed of this &s;ingular rite being performed, by preference, over the tomb of Stephen, the fir&s;t chri&s;tian martyr. In&s;tead of graves and tombs we find the river <HI>Jordan</HI> cho&s;en, and the river <HI>AEnon, near Salim, becau&s;e there was much water there.</HI> John iii. 23.&mdash;On this pa&s;&s;age we &s;hall offer a few plain thoughts; and &s;hould our corre&s;pondent, or any other of our readers, po&s;&s;e&s;s better, they are at liberty to maintain them.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="038552_0162_101259A5607F7158">
It is the obvious de&s;ign of the Apo&s;tle, in the whole of this chapter, by many different arguments, to prove the nature and certainty of the re&s;urrection of the dead. The argument in the text is drawn from the u&s;e and practice of the ordinance of bap|ti&s;m: each one, ob&s;erving that rite, is &s;aid to be <HI>bap|tized for the dead.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The dead</HI> here intended, in&s;tead of being Ste|phen, or any other believing, or martyred, buried &s;aint, we believe, is none other than our LORD JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf, <HI>who was dead, and is alive for evermore.</HI> Rev. i. 18. By the example and authority of this Saviour, and into his name and death, the primitive &s;aints were baptized&mdash;<HI>Know ye not that &s;o many of us as were baptized into Je&s;us Chri&s;t, were baptized into his death?</HI> Rom. vi. 3. Of his death and re&s;urrection bap|ti&s;m is a mo&s;t &s;triking emblem; and all who are believingly and truly baptized do thereby profe&s;s that their &s;ouls are wa&s;hed from guilt in the Re|deemer's bloody death; and, as &s;ure as Je&s;us ro&s;e out of the waters of bapti&s;m in Jordan, and out of the grave on the third day, &s;o, a&s;&s;uredly, &s;hall the dead bodies of his &s;aints ari&s;e in the &s;olemn day of judgment unto everla&s;ting life. Now (as if the Apo&s;tle had &s;aid) if Je&s;us be not ri&s;en&mdash;if there be no future re&s;urrection of human bodies from the

<BIBL>Job xxxviii. 17.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this double interrogation are de&s;cribed the two pa&s;&s;ages through which all mankind, the wicked and the righteous, pa&s;s from time to eternity;&mdash;pa&s;&s;ages the&s;e, infinitely more different in their nature and con&s;equences, than the terrifying gates which conduct a pri&s;oner to a tremendous dun|geon, and the beautiful doors which admit us to a magnificent palace.</P>
<P>THE GATES OF DEATH is the pa&s;&s;age of man from this to an un&s;een &s;tate, and, figuratively, de|&s;igns that truly affecting period when the powers of human nature break up;&mdash;the cutting of the cord of life;&mdash;the &s;eparation of the &s;oul from the body. This di&s;&s;olution, as a pair of ma&s;&s;y gates, forms the divi&s;ion between time and eternity.

The&s;e gates to &s;ome, through lingering di&s;ea&s;e, may long appear in view; while opening, they may grate upon the ear like har&s;h thunder; but, the pa&s;&s;age through them is in&s;tantaneous, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. At this pro&s;pect, our nature recoils. The expectation of our pa&s;&s;age through the&s;e gates embitters the cup of life, and bows our &s;pirits to the du&s;t.</P>
<P>But whence this dreadful pa&s;&s;age to futurity? Can that wi&s;e and holy BEING, who hath enriched us with &s;uch noble powers, &s;trowed in our path &s;uch a variety of earthly plea&s;ures, appoint us &s;uch an end? Is this worthy his attributes, or con&s;o|nant with his benevolence? Surely not. God cannot take plea&s;ure in the de&s;truction of the work of his own hand. Sin, &s;in procured mankind this terrifying exit from time to eternity. The &s;oul that &s;inneth, it &s;hall die. The wages of &s;in is death. By &s;in came death.

Here we learn, that <HI>as it is appointed to men once to die, &s;o after this the judgment.</HI> Heb. ix. 27. That <HI>God hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom he hath ordained.</HI> Acts xvii. 31. Solemn period! big with plea&s;ure or with pain! Je&s;us; &s;urrounded with myriads of angels, &s;hall rend the heavens, rai&s;e the dead, bring forth the impri&s;oned nations of the univer&s;e, and <HI>reward every man according to his works!</HI> Mat. xvi. 27. What reward can a guilty &s;inner expect from the hand of that God who&s;e law he hath tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, who&s;e unnumbered mercies he has abu&s;ed, and who&s;e con|&s;cience condemns him of every evil that merits the &s;evere&s;t frowns from incen&s;ed ju&s;tice? What, in|deed, can be expected but the &s;evere penalty of DEATH annexed to that law which binds us to the authority of Jehovah! Men of cool reflection mu&s;t acknowledge that nature, rea&s;on, con&s;cience,
<PB N="177" REF="038552_0179_101259D0C97B71C8">
and revelation, harmonize in pointing to this &s;o|lemn period that &s;hall terminate our &s;tate. It mu&s;t be &s;o. The thou&s;ands who laugh at the bugbear death, have their &s;ecret remor&s;e and dread of a future &s;tate, though pride and boa&s;ting infidelity prevent confe&s;&s;ion. It is folly in the fool to &s;ay he hath not thought, nor &s;huddered at the opening gates of death which lead a fellow mortal to that judgment-feat from whence there is no appeal. Who then but mu&s;t drop a tear over the mi&s;eries of human nature: &s;o mi&s;erable a life; &s;o wretched an end! Is there no balm to heal our woe? Can we di&s;cover no other pa&s;&s;age from time to eternity, which, at lea&s;t, may mitigate the pangs of di&s;&s;olv|ing nature, and give us &s;ome degree of hope? Yes, there is a way, worthy the God who hath appoint|ed it, and, at once, delightful and &s;ecure for mor|tals. There are&mdash;</P>
<P>THE DOORS OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH. The&s;e were erected by Je&s;us, the friend of &s;inners, the Son of the Mo&s;t High God; who&s;e eye beheld our wretched &s;tate, and who&s;e heart engaged him to redeem from the jaws of death and hell. For this he a&s;&s;umed our nature, became incarnate, took our iniquities, with all their heinou&s;ne&s;s and guilt, upon him&s;elf, that by the merit of his life, and the virtue of his death, he might &s;ave us
<PB N="178" REF="038552_0180_101229FF6AE68F28">
with a complete and everla&s;ting &s;alvation. This is the &s;ublime, the rapturous theme of the go&s;pel! <HI>Chri&s;t hath redeemed us from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us.</HI> He bore our &s;ins in his own body on the accur&s;ed tree;&mdash;put an end of &s;in by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf;&mdash;became obe|dient unto the death of the cro&s;s;&mdash;and aro&s;e from the tomb in te&s;timony of his conque&s;t, and to de|mon&s;trate our ju&s;tification in him. Thus Je&s;us entered the <HI>gates of death,</HI> and, in the dominions of the dead, di&s;armed the <HI>King of Terrors</HI> of his &s;ting; bound him in chains; made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of <HI>the keys of death;</HI> tore down the awful gates, and, upon their ruins, erected the DOORS OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, as the pa&s;&s;age through which his redeemed people &s;hould walk, to inherit the man&s;ions of glory. Here is our happy relief! <HI>Our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath abo|li&s;hed death, and brought life and immortality to light through the go&s;pel.</HI> Death and the grave are now at the command of Je&s;us: and in him we may triumphantly exclaim, "O Death! where is now thy &s;ting? O Grave! where is now thy vic|tory?"</P>
<P>The&s;e doors, erected by the Son of God, differ as much from the gates of death as the &s;hadow from its &s;ub&s;tance. As a &s;hadow is created by the
<PB N="179" REF="038552_0181_101259D4FB7709A8">
rays of light falling upon an opake body, &s;o Je&s;us, the glorious Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, who is the re|&s;urrection and life of his people, reflects his media|torial light upon death as a conquered foe, and thus his mortal &s;hadow is produced. As the &s;ha|dow of the greate&s;t enemy can do no one an inju|ry, &s;o believers will pa&s;s the &s;hadow of death in perfect &s;afety. Behold! how different the pro&s;|pect! Not the terrible gates of an eternal dungeon, but the magnificent doors of a delightful city; or, as the con&s;ecrated doors of the temple of Solomon, which introduced the pardoned wor&s;hipper to au|dience with JEHOVAH, in the Holy of Holies!</P>
<P>As the doors of the &s;hadow of death differ from the gates of death, &s;o does the avenue that conducts mankind to them. Je&s;us is the way, the truth and the life to the Father. <HI>If any man be in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, he is a new creature.</HI> By a &s;piritual, be|lieving union with Chri&s;t, the &s;oul experiences new light, life, hopes and plea&s;ures: Truth, love, meekne&s;s, benevolence, patience, every virtue com|manded by the law, or re&s;plendent in the go&s;pel, are more or le&s;s attendant on this chri&s;tian's path, and renders him honourable to God, beneficial to &s;ociety, and happy in him&s;elf. To him, to live is Chri&s;t, and, therefore, to die mu&s;t be his gain. David was a man enriched with &s;uch grace, and
<PB N="180" REF="038552_0182_101259D85CD48610">
viewed his pa&s;&s;age to eternity with the utmo&s;t com|po&s;ure. <HI>Though I walk through the valley of the &s;hadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me; thy rod and thy &s;taff, they comfort me.</HI> P&s;a. xxiii. This valley lies between God's two holy hills of the church militant and the church triumphant. It was but the &s;hadow, the faint image, the &s;weet &s;leep of death, he was to pa&s;s. Every fear &s;hould vani&s;h as the vapour, and the pre&s;ence of his Lord and Shepherd &s;hould &s;u&s;tain him with the rod of his power, and comfort him with the &s;weets of his love.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age through the doors of the &s;hadow of death, does not &s;imply mitigate the pangs of di&s;|&s;olving nature, but it bears the &s;oul triumphantly from time to eternity, in pro&s;pect of a final acquittal at the judgment-&s;eat, and an introduction to the bli&s;sful pre&s;ence of the Lord of glory. As the chri&s;tian draws near the clo&s;e of life, the doors of the &s;hadow of death gradually unfold. It is pecu|liar to this man's hope to know at which pa&s;&s;age he is to make his exit. He knows Je&s;us has been his fore-runner, and has, in great grace, appointed him the <HI>delightful doors,</HI> and not the <HI>doleful gates.</HI> As the&s;e doors open, the everla&s;ting hills appear in view; Angels &s;urround the pa&s;&s;age to welcome the dying chri&s;tian to immortality; Je&s;us, his well-known,
<PB N="181" REF="038552_0183_101259DBBA521590">
tried friend, that &s;ticketh clo&s;er than a brother, &s;tands ready to own and &s;upport him in his la&s;t conflict, and introduce him to plea&s;ures that never, never decline. Here, at la&s;t, we mu&s;t &s;top. Were we to collect the greate&s;t a&s;&s;emblage of earthly honours, riches, and delights, they would infinitely fail in a&s;&s;i&s;ting our ideas to e&s;timate the bli&s;s, the glory of heaven!</P>
<P>Let me now prevail upon the attentive reader to take a glance of the&s;e two pa&s;&s;ages to eternity. This becomes his duty, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that through ONE of the&s;e he mu&s;t &s;hortly pa&s;s, to return no more. One is beyond degree terrible, leading the thoughtle&s;s, the prophane, the unbelieving, the &s;elf-deceived &s;inner to the judgment of the great day, and to mi&s;eries beyond de&s;cription awful! the other to the man&s;ions of undi&s;turbed repo&s;e, and happine&s;s coeval with eternity! The former is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of &s;in; the latter is the fruit of God's everla&s;ting love, and the &s;ove|reign grace of the Lord Je&s;us. To which are we ha&s;tening? Let us, as &s;inners, fly to the Saviour's arms, to be pardoned in his blood, ju&s;tified in his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and made holy by his grace; then we &s;hall anticipate the doors of the &s;hadow of death with cheerfulne&s;s, and know for our&s;elves,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mr. JOHN COBBY.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the heroes of the field, the votaries of di&s;&s;ipation, and the profe&s;&s;ors of art, each claim a place in the page of hi&s;tory, to perpetuate their names and their actions to po&s;terity, it &s;hall be our ambition to allot a few leaves, in this publication, to the memory of tho&s;e who&s;e better hearts and lives proclaim the riche&s;t grace of God. Thus, while <HI>the memory of the ju&s;t is ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> we &s;et their example before our eyes, to &s;timulate us to walk in the paths of Je&s;us, and await, with com|po&s;ure and joy, the period of our own departure to an eternal &s;tate.</P>
<P>The per&s;on to be recorded in this obituary is Deacon JOHN COBBY. He was a native of Great-Britain, born at Brighthelm&s;tone. What|ever
<PB N="183" REF="038552_0185_101259E008D283B0">
may have been the temper and conduct of his juvenile years, whether moral or vicious, we learn that God was plea&s;ed to call him, by grace, at an early period; and which &s;timulated his heart, through the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;tages of his life, to pray for, and ardently de&s;ire, the conver&s;ion of youth. In the fir&s;t exerci&s;es of his mind he was remarka|bly lively, and frequented public wor&s;hip, among chri&s;tians of different religious denominations.&mdash;When the blaze of his zeal began to fall, and the more &s;olid influence of grace to operate upon his heart, he was convinced that the Lord who re|deemed him was King in Zion, that he was called <HI>to have re&s;pect unto all his commandments,</HI> for public wor&s;hip as well as for private life; and that it was his duty to gain more &s;atisfaction on the will of the Saviour than hitherto he had at|tained. He was con&s;tant in prayer, and diligent in &s;earching the &s;cripture, as the only rule for his faith and practice. At this period his judgment was greatly informed, by a di&s;cour&s;e he heard from Numb. x. 29. <HI>We are journeying unto the place of which the Lord &s;aid, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the Lord hath &s;poken good concerning I&s;rael.</HI> From clear conviction of duty, and with that &s;o|lemn reverence, the &s;avor of which ever abode
<PB N="184" REF="038552_0186_101259E3644BEA78">
with him, he publicly owned his Redeemer in bap|ti&s;m, by immer&s;ion, on confe&s;&s;ion of his faith; then was received into chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip by the church at Woolwich, under the care of the Rev. Mr. M'Gregor, and walked with that people in honour for &s;ome years. For good and &s;ufficient rea&s;ons, unnece&s;&s;ary to be mentioned here, he united with a new-gathered church in the &s;ame town, under the mini&s;try of Mr. Adam Freeman.</P>
<P>Mr. Cobby, although he held a place in his Ma|je&s;ty's dock-yard at Woolwich, was, in political &s;entiment, a republican; which, united with a warm attachment to America, induced him, with his family, to quit his native &s;hore, and form a &s;ettlement in New-York. Perfectly &s;atisfied with this favoured land, Mr. Cobby obtained an ho|nourable and affectionate di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the church at Woolwich, and united him&s;elf with the church in Fair-&s;treet, where, after due trial, he was ap|pointed a deacon, which office he &s;u&s;tained until his death.</P>
<P>He was a per&s;on of very great diffidence of &s;pi|rit, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an abiding &s;en&s;e of the evils of his heart, and his utter unworthine&s;s, both in the &s;ight of God and man; frequently adoring the riches of God's abounding grace in the &s;alvation of him as the chief of &s;inners, and the vile&s;t of the vile. Al|though
<PB N="185" REF="038552_0187_10125AC3981B3BF0">
Providence had denied Mr. Cobby the ad|vantages of education&mdash;nor had he ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a dictionary&mdash;yet he was enriched with a mo&s;t agree|able poetic talent, &s;pecimens of which have repeat|edly been introduced into the <HI>Chri&s;tian's Pocket Library.</HI> He publi&s;hed a poetic e&s;&s;ay on the Per|&s;on and Glory of Chri&s;t, and of the Holy Spirit; which met with good reception from many intelli|gent, pious readers. He has left behind him a con&s;iderable number of hymns, and other poetical pieces, which, was due encouragement given to his widow, their publication might be of real bene|fit. His memory was remarkably &s;trong and accu|rate, particularly &s;o in the knowledge of the &s;acred &s;cripture, repeating texts verbatim, with &s;olemn empha&s;is. It always gave him extreme pain to hear any one, e&s;pecially a mini&s;ter in the pulpit, torture a text by fal&s;e reading, or repeating. And, I cannot but recommend an accurate reading of the &s;acred text to my young readers in particular; and, whatever pa&s;&s;age they may commit to memory, that it be done perfectly. If it is of no other be|nefit, it certainly di&s;covers an attentive and an ho|ne&s;t heart towards the will of God. But, what was &s;till more commendable in Mr. Cobby, was his uniformity and &s;teadfa&s;tne&s;s in &s;entiment, and profe&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel, in his family, and in the
<PB N="186" REF="038552_0188_10122A0FA0135D60">
hou&s;e of God. Through the influence of God's ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit upon his heart, <HI>he was planted in the hou&s;e of the Lord, and flouri&s;hed in the courts of our God. He &s;till brought forth fruit,</HI> even <HI>to old age.</HI> P&s;a. xcii. 13, 14. So far from the pro|hibition of Solomon refering to him&mdash;<HI>meddle not with them that are given to change,</HI> Prov. xxiv. 21. like ancient Judah, <HI>he ruled with God, and was faithful to the &s;aints.</HI> Ho&s;ea xi. 12. None could attend to the voice of this good man's prayer, whether in his family or in the &s;ocial circle of his friends, without a conviction that, in that &s;olemn exerci&s;e, he really <HI>drew near to God.</HI> Although, in private conver&s;ation, and when in the di&s;charge of his duty as a deacon, his words were few, and his lips <HI>&s;low of &s;peech,</HI> yet in prayer they were abundant, copious, lively, and truly &s;olemn; every by-&s;tander feeling their weight upon the mind. Latterly, it was evident to my&s;elf and others, that his communion with God was &s;o great, that he was ripening, as the &s;tanding corn, for the &s;ickle of death, and for the heavenly garner.</P>
<P>When pe&s;tilence raged in our &s;treets, and &s;wept away thou&s;ands, young and old, Mr. Cobby was therewith arre&s;ted, and laid upon his dying pillow. The proce&s;s of the dire di&s;ea&s;e, with him, was very &s;hort. He in&s;tantly felt the arrows of death,
<PB N="187" REF="038552_0189_10122A34E7145948">
and wi&s;hed <HI>to depart, to be with Chri&s;t,</HI> whom, un&s;een, he ardently loved. The nature of the malady prevented him from &s;aying much; but he evidently felt richly the pre&s;ence of that Saviour whom he then commended to all around him as <HI>the Friend that &s;ticketh clo&s;er than a brother.</HI> Prov. xviii. 24. He repeated frequently the nine|tieth and the hundred and third P&s;alm (Dr. Watts') with infinite &s;atisfaction. Perceiving his end to draw near, he called his family around him, and, in a faithful, affecting manner, addre&s;&s;ed his wife and his children. A &s;tranger, who came to attend him, was a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;cene; to whom Mr. Cobby &s;aid, "My friend, I do not know you, or whether you know the Lord, but I can now tell you, Chri&s;t is worth living for, and dying for; and he is now precious to my &s;oul" He then &s;ent his chri&s;tian love to his mini&s;ter, and to the members of his church, with others, mentioned by name. This done, he piou&s;ly committed him&s;elf to God; then re&s;igned him&s;elf to the la&s;t efforts of death. And, as though the pe&s;tilence was ordered by heaven to withhold its fury until the good man had performed his la&s;t work of faith and love be|low, it now ru&s;hed upon him; poured in its &s;harp|e&s;t arrows; di&s;torted his body; &s;ilenced his &s;peech; produced the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing groans; and, in one
<PB N="188" REF="038552_0190_101259E5E3D92790">
hour, clo&s;ed his eyes in death! aged 55 years. A di&s;cour&s;e was delivered on his death from the&s;e words: <HI>God took him.</HI> Gen. v. 24. Let us, therefore, fly for refuge to a Saviour's bleeding heart, and walk beneath his &s;hadow; for <HI>precious in the &s;ight of the Lord is the death of his &s;aints,</HI> whether it be in youth or in old age, at &s;ea or on land, by &s;low di&s;ea&s;e, or by the nau&s;eous pe&s;tilence!</P>

<P>It is of infinite moment we learn, from the go&s;|pel, that the manner in which the fulne&s;s of Je&s;us is communicated to his people is by the HOLY GHOST. <HI>He &s;hall glorify me: for he &s;hall re|ceive of mine, and &s;hall &s;hew it unto you.

A few thoughts, therefore, &s;hall now be of|fered upon it; not as it may be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in its ex|ten&s;ive latitude, but as more immediately re&s;tricted to the double a&s;cen&s;ion of Je&s;us; <HI>once</HI> at death, and <HI>then</HI> forty days after.</P>
<P>To the thief upon the cro&s;s our Lord &s;aid, <HI>This day thou &s;halt be with me in Paradi&s;e</HI>&mdash;the heavenly &s;tate of bli&s;s a&s;&s;igned for the reception of his departed &s;oul. The body of Je&s;us died; was taken from the cro&s;s; was embalmed with &s;pices; and then laid in Jo&s;eph's new tomb.</P>
<P>On the third day the &s;oul of Je&s;us returned from the cele&s;tial paradi&s;e, claimed its entomed body, re|animated it by union, bur&s;t the bars of death, and came forward, performing many of the functions
<PB N="209" REF="038552_0211_10125A1A1B2B8930">
of natural life, as it had done previous to its cru|cifixion.</P>
<P>After conver&s;e with his di&s;ciples forty days, and appearing <HI>to five hundred brethren at once,</HI>&mdash;to convince them of the re&s;urrection of the very &s;ame identical body, he went with many of his di&s;|ciples as far as Bethamy, and there, in the very act of ble&s;&s;ing them, was vi&s;ibly parted from them, and a cloud received him out of their &s;ight. Luke xxi. 50, 51. E&s;corted by myriads of angels, he was then <HI>&s;et down at the right hand of the Maje&s;ty on High,</HI> as a proof of the glory of his per&s;on, the completene&s;s of his works, and as having <HI>become the fir&s;t fruit of them that &s;lept.</HI> From thence, according to his own infallible prediction, he will come again to judge the world, and to receive his people unto him&s;elf, to be partakers of his eternal glory.</P>
<P>This twofold a&s;cent of the human &s;oul of Chri&s;t, fir&s;t without the body, then with the body and &s;oul united, is the &s;ame with the privilege of his re|deemed people. Their bodies fir&s;t return to the du&s;t from whence they were taken; and, in&s;tantly, their &s;ouls, their immortal &s;pirits, a&s;cend to God who gave them. Eccl. xii. 7. <HI>Ab&s;ent from the body, pre&s;ent with the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But, on that glorious morning, when the <HI>trump of God &s;hall &s;ound,</HI> and the dead in Chri&s;t ari&s;e from their graves, whether in earth, or in the bo|&s;om
<PB N="210" REF="038552_0212_10125A1BD91D8CD8">
of the &s;eas, then &s;hall their &s;ouls al&s;o, as did the holy &s;oul of their Lord and Head, each claim their own proper body, now, by the power of God, made like unto the glorious body of the Son of God. <HI>Every man</HI> &s;hall be rai&s;ed <HI>in his own order: Chri&s;t the fir&s;t fruits; afterward they that are Chri&s;t's at his coming.</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 23.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed and holy are they that have part in this fir&s;t re&s;urrection: on &s;uch, the &s;econd death hath no power; but they &s;hall be prie&s;ts of God and of Chri&s;t, and &s;hall reign with him a thou&s;and years. Rev. xx. 6. Then, after Satan &s;hall be lo&s;ed for a little &s;ea&s;on, <HI>Gog and Magog,</HI> the combined armies of &s;in and Satan, filling up the mea&s;ure of their iniquity, &s;hall be prepared for the final judgment; the Redeemer &s;hall welcome his &s;aints to ultimate final glory! <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from before the foundation of the world.</HI></P>
<P>How delightful the pro&s;pect! How worthy the ri&s;en Head of the ran&s;omed Church! How cheer|ing to our hope, and how nouri&s;hing to our faith! Well may we &s;ay with Paul, <HI>I know whom I have believed, and I am per&s;uaded that he is able</HI> (by virtue of his divine power, and the merit of his re&s;urrection) <HI>to keep that which I have committed unto him,</HI> body and &s;oul, <HI>again&s;t that day.</HI> 2 Tim. i. 12.</P>

<HEAD>HOW TO LIVE AS A CHRISTIAN, AND TO GLORIFY GOD.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An original Letter from the late Rev. William Romaine.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH much plea&s;ure I an&s;wer your inquiry: may God make it u&s;eful to you and to yours!&mdash;You wi&s;h to live as a chri&s;tian, and to glorify God. A chri&s;tian is one who lives in Chri&s;t, and lives upon Chri&s;t. He is quickened by the &s;pirit of life, and made one with Chri&s;t; and he lives and performs all the acts of &s;piritual life by the &s;ame way that he was made alive. He who lives mo&s;t in this manner is the be&s;t chri&s;tian, and will bring mo&s;t glory to God. This being laid down as your great principle and leading truth, it &s;hould be very well e&s;tabli&s;hed that you are a believer.</P>
<P>HAVE I FAITH?&mdash;DO I LIVE BY IT?&mdash;AL|WAYS?&mdash;AND FOR ALL THINGS?</P>
<P>Your whole life will be only the u&s;e and appli|cation of the&s;e few que&s;tions; but be &s;ure you get &s;cripture evidence of the fir&s;t, left, when you have need of <HI>the &s;word of the Spirit,</HI> you &s;hould que&s;|tion, as many do, whether it is theirs or not.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="038552_0214_10125A2293BFDCC8">
As to the &s;econd, a main point is to know your|&s;elf &s;till a &s;on of the fir&s;t Adam, although a &s;on of the &s;econd Adam, who is <HI>the Lord from hea|ven.</HI> If you leave out this truth, you will be puzzled at every &s;tep; becau&s;e you will always find &s;omething in you acting again&s;t faith. Re|member, then, the animal man lives an animal life, the &s;piritual man lives a &s;piritual life; and you have both the&s;e in you. The &s;pring of all the ani|mal man's actions is <HI>&s;en&s;e,</HI> the &s;pring of all the &s;piritual man's actions is <HI>faith.</HI> To this <HI>faith</HI> he was quickened when <HI>the &s;pirit of life,</HI> which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, enabled him to believe the record of God concerning his Son.</P>
<P>In every real chri&s;tian there are the&s;e two na|tures. He lives <HI>in</HI> the fle&s;h, although he lives <HI>by</HI> the Spirit. The old Adam is continually inclining him to live an animal life; and the new man is con|tinually inclining him to live a &s;piritual life, and enabling him too, if he be then living by the faith of the Son of God. So it is written, "The fle&s;h lu&s;teth again&s;t the Spirit, and the Spirit again&s;t the fle&s;h." Gal. v. 17. The great employment of every believer is to be found u&s;ing the means of God's appointment to deaden the life of &s;en&s;e, or the lu&s;tings of the fle&s;h, and to &s;trengthen the life of faith by the aids of the Holy Spirit. Hence ap|pears
<PB N="213" REF="038552_0215_10125A242CED01D0">
the nece&s;&s;ity of the word of God, both to evidence what you are in Chri&s;t, and what you are to expect from Chri&s;t, in fighting the good fight of faith: for the promi&s;es in the word are to teach you what God has freely given to you, and has warranted you to come and to take out of the ful|ne&s;s of his Son, and to u&s;e it for your own. His deed of gift is as good a title as you can po&s;&s;ibly have to any thing in the world; for all the promi&s;es were made to Chri&s;t; all the promi&s;es have been made good to Chri&s;t; and Chri&s;t has all power, in heaven and earth, to make them good to you. It is his office and his glory to give you whatever God has promi&s;ed, and you call upon him to be|&s;tow even all things that belong to life and godli|ne&s;s. Your dependence on his faithfulne&s;s engages him to be&s;tow every needful grace. This de|pendence is the life and &s;oul of the true chri&s;tian, and runs through all his experience. Not only prayer and prai&s;e, reading, hearing, meditating on the word, but al&s;o the common things of this life, &s;hould be carried on in this dependence, both as to our union with Chri&s;t our head, and as to our com|munion with him as his members.</P>
<P>Here, then, comes in our la&s;t inquiry&mdash;If you live by faith, <HI>is it always? is it for all things?</HI></P>
<P>The command is, <HI>Tru&s;t in him</HI> at all times.&mdash;
<PB N="214" REF="038552_0216_10125A26AD5AF640">
Tru&s;t him night and day&mdash;&s;ummer and winter. Tru&s;t him when things go wrong&mdash;in &s;ickne&s;s and in adver&s;ity. That is the time to tru&s;t him for mo&s;t grace, when you want mo&s;t. Tru&s;t and you &s;hall have it; for the word cannot be broken. <HI>According to your faith, &s;o &s;hall it be done unto you.</HI> Little matters call for his direction, and call for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as well as great; becau&s;e, <HI>with|out him you can do nothing.</HI> By leaving Chri&s;t out, believers oftener mi&s;carry in little things than in great. He leaves them to them&s;elves, and then they blunder, as it is fit they &s;hould, who neglect &s;uch a guide. He offers him&s;elf to you, to be your wi&s;dom, and he would give you his coun&s;el in all your matters. You cannot think till you try, and by con&s;tant trial improve it, what a happine&s;s it is thus to live upon Chri&s;t as your teacher. He would keep you from ten thou&s;and &s;crapes, guide you through difficulties, ble&s;s you under troubles; yea, he would give you a &s;piritual u&s;e of temporal things. Re&s;olve upon &s;omething of this, and wait the event. In your family, in your field, in buy|ing and &s;elling, con&s;ult Chri&s;t about all. Improve this hint: eat and drink, and lie down and ri&s;e up; do all, eyeing him, and then all will pro&s;per.</P>

<HEAD>Memoirs of the late Rev. OLIVER HART, M. A. of Hopewell, New Jer&s;ey.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>His walk &s;o &s;teady, and his hope &s;o high,</L>
<L>He neither blu&s;h'd to live, nor fear'd to die.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN pre&s;erving memoirs of tho&s;e whom God hath di&s;tingui&s;hed by his goodne&s;s, whether in private or in public life, is one mean by which, <HI>in the ages to come, God &s;ets forth the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindne&s;s towards us, by Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> and never fails to &s;timulate the followers of the Lamb in faith and love, to pur&s;ue the path with greater ardour that leadeth to everla&s;ting life. It is with the&s;e views we attempt to draw the outlines of the life and character of the truly venerable Mr. Hart.</P>
<P>For the encouragement of our young readers, it affords us plea&s;ure that we have it in our power to &s;ay, Mr. Hart was enriched with the grace of Chri&s;t in his youth; and, from a &s;en&s;e of his Sa|viour's love, devoted him&s;elf to God, by bapti&s;m, and was received a member of the church at South|ampton, April 3, 1741, being &s;eventeen years and nine months old. How un&s;peakably happy this youth! while many others of his age pur&s;ued the paths of corruption, that unavoidably prepare them
<PB N="216" REF="038552_0218_10125A2BE9565620">
for deepe&s;t &s;orrows in old age, Mr. Hart had a long and happy race before him, to promote the intere&s;t of his fellow mortals, enjoy the &s;weets of virtuous life, and honour his God and Saviour. Thus planted in the hou&s;e of the Lord, and root|ed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, Mr. Hart flouri&s;hed in gifts and grace &s;o eminently, that the church beheld him as one evidently de&s;igned of the Lord to bear the mi|ni&s;try of the go&s;pel. Accordingly, after due ex|erci&s;e, on Dec. 20, 1746, they &s;ent him forth, with te&s;timonial letters, accompanied with fervent prayers for his pro&s;perity in the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t. Three years after he received ordination, and accepted a call from the church at Charle&s;ton, South-Caro|lina; the pa&s;toral care of which he honourably and &s;ucce&s;sfully maintained for thirty years. On the approach of the Briti&s;h fleet and army, Febru|ary 16, 1780, determining to pre&s;erve his political liberty, he retired to the northern &s;tates. The at|tention of the church at Hopewell, New-Jer&s;ey, was &s;oon directed to Mr. Hart, and on December 16, in the &s;ame year, he became their Pa&s;tor, &s;erv|ing them with fidelity and &s;ucce&s;s, until his removal by death, December 31, 1795, aged 72 years, 5 months and 26 days.</P>
<P>As a te&s;timony of re&s;pect to this good man, an excellent &s;ermon was delivered in Charle&s;ton, South-Carolina,
<PB N="217" REF="038552_0219_10125A2E6A0AD528">
by the Rev. Richard Furman, M. A. February 7, 1796; and, on April 4, an animated di&s;cour&s;e was delivered on the &s;ame occa&s;ion at Hopewell, New-Jer&s;ey, by the Rev. William Ro|gers, D. D. From tho&s;e valuable publications, and from &s;ome manu&s;cript materials communicated by Mrs. Hart to the Editor of the Chri&s;tian's Pocket Library, we will attempt to draw &s;ome general outlines of this pious man's private and public cha|racter, not only as a memorial of the di&s;tingui&s;hing grace of God upon him, but to &s;timulate our own &s;ouls to copy after the pattern of &s;o excellent a life, that was crowned with &s;o glorious an end.</P>
<P N="1">1. As a chri&s;tian he was, indeed, one with Chri&s;t, "To him, to live was Chri&s;t." Phil. i. 21. The PERSON of Chri&s;t was the object of his affections; the BLOOD of Chri&s;t was the fountain of his pardon; the RIGHTEOUSNESS of Chri&s;t was the ground of his ju&s;tification and communion with Jehovah; and the GLORY of Chri&s;t was the determinate end of all his actions. His whole dependence, living and dying, was upon Chri&s;t; for being near his end, a per&s;on &s;itting by, ob&s;erv|ing his great bodily di&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid, "how happy for Mr. Hart that he has but one work to do;" (dying was meant) to which Mr. Hart immediately replied, <HI>Chri&s;t is the end of the law for righteou&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="218" REF="038552_0220_10125A31CC6B13C0">
to every one that believeth.</HI> The TRUTH, as it is in Chri&s;t, was deeply engraven upon the brea&s;t of Mr. Hart; &s;o deeply, that it was, indeed, to him, ine&s;timably precious; and the TEMPER of Je&s;us, in a mo&s;t eminent degree, &s;hone in all his con|ver&s;ation, by which he was univer&s;ally re&s;pected and beloved. He was a man of prayer; great was his communion with God, and by this he was com|forted and &s;upported under all the ills of life. This is evinced by the following lines, which he com|po&s;ed in a time of di&s;tre&s;s:
<Q><LG>
<L>Foreboding thoughts, and gloomy fears,</L>
<L>Crow'd thick into my brea&s;t;</L>
<L>Perplexing doubts, and anxious cares,</L>
<L>Forbid my eyes to re&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Happy ye &s;aints, above the &s;kies,</L>
<L>Beyond the reach of woe;</L>
<L>Dear Lord, command my &s;oul to ri&s;e&mdash;</L>
<L>With joyful ha&s;te I'll go.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The world, in &s;ackcloth and di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>I'd have beneath my feet,</L>
<L>And mounting, in an heavenly dre&s;s,</L>
<L>I would my Saviour meet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then why, my &s;oul, &s;unk down &s;o low,</L>
<L>When Je&s;us doth depart?</L>
<L>He will return&mdash;and thou &s;halt know</L>
<L>The goodne&s;s of his heart.</L>

2. In dome&s;tic life, the hu&s;band, father, friend and ma&s;ter, in their &s;acred principles, and their mo&s;t endearing ties, were highly eminent in Mr. Oliver Hart. He was not a <HI>&s;aint</HI> abroad and a <HI>devil</HI> at home, but &s;tedfa&s;t and invariable in pri|vate and in public; never &s;o happy as when tread|ing in the &s;teps of his Lord and Saviour, and ren|dering every one happy that re&s;ided beneath his roof. Mr. Hart was twice married. His fir&s;t wife was Mi&s;s Sarah Brees, by whom he had eight children, <HI>two</HI> only of whom are now living. His &s;econd wife, his pre&s;ent relict, was Mrs. Ann Grimball, by whom he had two &s;ons: the fir&s;t died young&mdash;the other is &s;till living, pa&s;&s;ing through his &s;tudies, under the Rev. Mr. Stoughton; and, it is devoutly wi&s;hed, that the youth may form the amiable character of his father, and be a &s;olace to the declining days of his pious mother! Perhaps the dome&s;tic life of Mr. Hart cannot be more &s;weet|ly pourtrayed than as drawn by the pen of his wi|dow, in a letter to the editor of this publication.&mdash;"My lo&s;s is great, although my dear hu&s;band's gain. I mourn not as tho&s;e who have no hope: no! yet I have cau&s;e to mourn. I mi&s;s him day by day. No more I hear his harmonious voice &s;ounding from the &s;acred de&s;k <HI>the everla&s;ting go&s;|pel.</HI> No more the morning and evening &s;acrifice
<PB N="220" REF="038552_0222_10125A370DBC1D00">
of prai&s;e. No more his pre&s;ence gladdens my &s;ight. My protector, guide, head, be&s;t earthly friend&mdash;gone! Yes&mdash;the pious father of my lit|tle &s;on&mdash;left without a guide, example, precept, in his giddy &s;tate. Circum&s;tances aggravate my lo&s;s&mdash;yet I would not murmur, but be humble un|der God's mighty hand! He hath cut off the <HI>&s;tream</HI>&mdash;HIMSELF is yet the everla&s;ting <HI>fountain,</HI> and can con&s;olation &s;end through redeeming grace and dying love!" It is often &s;aid, "He is a bad father that is not mi&s;&s;ed:" but what female eye can forbear the tear over a widow who laments the lo&s;s of &s;o kind an hu&s;band! and what man's brea&s;t but mu&s;t glow with ardour to leave &s;o noble a te&s;|timony behind him as hu&s;band, father, friend!</P>
<P N="3">3. Charmed with this good man's character at home and abroad, let us glance at him in his more public &s;tation, as a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel of &s;alva|tion. He that fir&s;t makes not good his claim to a <HI>chri&s;tian,</HI> illy pretends the chri&s;tian <HI>teacher!</HI> The waters of &s;piritual life, in copious &s;treams, flowed &s;en&s;ibly through the &s;oul of Mr. Hart, and from this &s;ource his mouth &s;pake the glories of the Lamb&mdash;the completene&s;s of &s;alvation&mdash;the expe|rience of the &s;aints&mdash;the beauties of Zion&mdash;the va&s;t, the inconceivable &s;olemnities of the eternal world! The churches at Southampton, at Charle&s;ton, and
<PB N="221" REF="038552_0223_10125A38A644A568">
at Hopewell, have his prai&s;es in their gates; which, probably, can be exceeded only by tho&s;e individuals, in the different parts of the continent, to whom God ble&s;&s;ed his mini&s;try for the conver&s;ion of their &s;ouls. With what &s;en&s;ibility would he vi&s;it the hou&s;e of woe, and tenderly wipe away the tear of grief by go&s;pel con&s;olation!&mdash;The private and pub|lic duties of the pa&s;toral office he di&s;charged with &s;uch fidelity, heavenly-mindedne&s;s, and amiable fortitude, that every de&s;cription of characters, among the flocks of his care, loved and honoured him as <HI>a man of God.</HI> With admirable ju&s;tne&s;s has Dr. Rogers a&s;&s;erted, in his &s;ermon&mdash;"In our a&s;&s;ocia|tion he has &s;carcely left his <HI>equal:</HI> in the United States, with diffidence be it &s;poken, viewing him in the whole of his character, he has not left his <HI>&s;uperior.</HI>" And, while we thus &s;peak his prai&s;e, we di&s;dain the flatterer's art. His life, his actions, were the fruit of grace, and &s;tand on record, to in&s;pire our &s;ouls to tread the paths of Zion, with equal honour and with equal &s;ucce&s;s. Had COW|PER heard him preach, and beheld him &s;tanding, with his wonted &s;olemn air, between the living and the dead, his pen would not be charged with being dipt in &s;oul flattery, while drawing his portrait:

<P N="4">4. Although we have nearly extended the limits u&s;ually allotted to the &s;everal pieces introduced into this publication, yet we mu&s;t add, that the literary character of Mr. Hart was worthy of e&s;teem.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding he had not the advantages of a collegiate education, his own indu&s;try was &s;o great, that he made very con&s;iderable advancement in cla&s;|&s;ical learning. The college at Rhode-I&s;land was not inattentive to his worth; for, in the year 1769, they conferred on him the degree of <HI>Ma&s;ter in the Arts.</HI> What is mo&s;t worthy of our re|mark is, that every acqui&s;ition in &s;cience he con&s;i|dered &s;o far valuable as to promote his &s;pirituality, and his greater u&s;efulne&s;s as a mini&s;ter of Je&s;us. Several of his valuable di&s;cour&s;es, and other pieces, have been publi&s;hed, and univer&s;ally received.
<PB N="223" REF="038552_0225_10125A3E8E11BEE0">
Other excellent manu&s;cripts are in the hand of his widow, which, with extracts from his diary, would prove highly advantageous, was &s;uitable encouragement offered for their publication.</P>
<P N="5">5. From the&s;e general traits, happily evident in the character of Mr. Hart, as a chri&s;tian and as a mini&s;ter, maintained with &s;uch uniformity and re|gularity, with &s;uch &s;olemnity and deep humility, for &s;o many years, amid&s;t &s;o many changes and variety of duties, we are anxious to mark the la&s;t &s;cenes of his life. In this we are charmed, and by this we have hope.</P>
<Q><L>He &s;at like the &s;un, nor cloud po&s;&s;e&s;s'd.</L></Q>

THE DOVE.</HEAD>
<P>DOVE is the Engli&s;h name of a bird of the pigeon kind, belonging to the order of Columbine. From the &s;tock-dove, it is &s;aid, the tame-pigeon, with all its variety, derives its origin. The charac|ters of the dove are, that the tongue is whole and
<PB N="225" REF="038552_0227_10125A42A54B7C40">
even, without any divi&s;ion: the beak is of an at|tenuated and conic figure: the no&s;trils are oblong, &s;kinny, and partly covered: it has no gall: its eggs are very clear and beautiful. Linnaeus enumerates forty &s;pecies of the dove. Be&s;ides the variety of the pigeon kind, this bird is denominated the ring-dove and the turtle-dove.</P>
<P>The RING-DOVE is of a larger &s;ize, and makes its ne&s;t, of a few dry &s;ticks, in the boughs of trees. The &s;ize of this bird is eighteen inches long, thirty in breadth, and weighs about twenty ounces. The head, back, and coverts of the wings, are of a blui&s;h a&s;h-colour. The lower part of the neck and brea&s;t is purple, inclining to red, and da&s;hed with a&s;h-colour. On the hind-part of the head is a &s;emi-circular line of white; above and below which the feathers are glo&s;&s;y, and of changeable colours, as oppo&s;ed to the light. The belly is of a yellowi&s;h white: the greater quill feathers are du&s;ky, and the re&s;t are a&s;h-coloured.</P>
<P>The TURTLE-DOVE is much &s;hyer than any of the other kind. It may readily be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the re&s;t by the iris of the eye, which is of a fine yellow, and a beautiful crim&s;on circle which encompa&s;&s;es the eye-lids. The forehead is whiti&s;h: the top of the head a&s;h-coloured, bor|dered with olive-brown, &s;potted with black; the
<PB N="226" REF="038552_0228_10125A45229B5060">
quill feathers are of a du&s;ky brown; the brea&s;t of a light purpli&s;h red, the verge of each feather being yellow; the belly is white, and the &s;ides and inner coverts of the wings blui&s;h. The tail, which is three inches and an half long, has two feathers in the middle of a du&s;ky brown, the others being black tipt with white. The head, and the exterior &s;ides of the feathers, are entirely white. The fidelity of the turtle-dove is proverbial. A pair put into a cage, if one dies the other will not long &s;urvive its mate. The union between the male and female is pre&s;erved with the highe&s;t degree of cha&s;tity; and if any breach happen between them, they are &s;oon reconciled, and embrace each other. Of this beautiful bird very frequent mention is made in the holy &s;cripture.</P>
<P N="1">1. As an emblem of the Holy Gho&s;t, who, in the form of a dove, de&s;cended upon Chri&s;t at the memorable period of his bapti&s;m, thereby &s;hewing the di&s;tinct per&s;onality of the Spirit from the Father and the Son. And what bird more fit to de&s;cribe the &s;wiftne&s;s of the Spirit's de&s;cent upon the &s;oul of man?&mdash;the loveline&s;s, integrity, purity and &s;pi|rituality of his heavenly influences, which, like the dove, is indeed without the gall of bitterne&s;s. In the formation of the material world, <HI>the &s;pirit of God moved</HI> (INCUBABAT) <HI>upon the face of the

waters,</HI> "to impregnate them (&s;ays Dr. Gill), as a dove upon her eggs to hatch them"&mdash;to &s;eparate the parts which were mixed together, and to give them a quickening virtue to produce living creatues in them. This &s;en&s;e is charmingly expre&s;&s;ed by Mil|ton&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;And, with mighty wings out-&s;pread,</L>
<L>Dove-like, &s;at'&s;t brooding on the va&s;t aby&s;s,</L>
<L>And mad'&s;t it pregnant&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>PAR. LOST, b. I.</BIBL></Q>
The targums of Jonathan and Jeru&s;alem call the Spirit who moved upon the waters "the Spirit of mercies&mdash;the Spirit of the Me&s;&s;iah." Of Me&s;&s;iah it was foretold, "<HI>The Spirit of the Lord &s;hall re&s;t upon him, the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and under|&s;tanding, the &s;pirit of coun&s;el and might, the &s;pirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord.</HI> I&s;a. xi. 2. And, at the bapti&s;m of Je&s;us, this pre|diction was accompli&s;hed, and abundantly verified, in all the acts of his future life. Tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed heavens, that were &s;hut by man's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, were mercifully opened when Je&s;us, the Saviour of man, <HI>fulfilled all righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> the Spirit, in the form of a dove, de&s;cending and re&s;ting upon him, to demon&s;trate his approbation, to qualify him for his prophetic office, in order to preach the ac|ceptable year of the Lord; while the Father crowns

the &s;olemnity with an audible voice: <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed.</HI> Matt. iii. 13, 17. Thus the whole Trinity was di&s;tinctly revealed on this memorable occa&s;ion, and demands our profounde&s;t reverence. As the Spirit before named had his part in producing the material world, &s;o al&s;o in the &s;piritual world of grace&mdash;fir&s;t on Chri&s;t, then upon his members, who are compared to doves.</P>
<P N="2">2. The church, the beloved members of Chri&s;t's &s;piritual body, are addre&s;&s;ed by him as doves. <HI>My dove, my undefiled, is but one.</HI> S. Song. vi. 9. <HI>One</HI> in his eye, his heart, his hand; and but <HI>one</HI> in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame grace, truth and love, by each individual member, in what&s;oever nation, age, clime or denomination, they may be found on earth. The&s;e per&s;ons, in their native, corrupted &s;tate, by original and actual &s;in, are in abject &s;lavery to the powers of death, and to the evil bias of their own natures; for a deliverance from which is the ince&s;&s;ant cry of every one who feels the condition into which they are fallen: <HI>O deli|ver not the &s;oul of thy turtle-dove unto the mul|titude of the wicked.</HI> P&s;a. lxxiv. 18. To which the ble&s;&s;ed Saviour grants a mo&s;t gracious reply, and promi&s;e of deliverance: <HI>Though thou ha&s;t lain among the pots, yet &s;hall ye be as the wings
<PB N="229" REF="038552_0231_10125A4CE6A1E098">
of a dove covered with &s;ilver, and her feathers of yellow gold.</HI> P&s;a. lxviii. 13. As if he had &s;aid, "Though now covered with du&s;t and a&s;hes, and reduced to a &s;tate of mental wretchedne&s;s, more &s;ervile and ba&s;e than Egyptian &s;laves among the &s;ooty pots and cauldrons of their ma&s;ters; yet thou &s;halt ari&s;e, and, by the merit of my righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the renewals of my grace, enjoy the glorious liberty of the &s;ons of God. The fruit of my &s;pirit &s;hall &s;o richly adorn thy &s;oul, and the light of my countenance &s;hall &s;o &s;en&s;ibly thine upon thee, that thou &s;halt appear glorious, as the beautiful plumage of an ea&s;tern dove, gli&s;tening interchangeably as with &s;ilver and gold, while &s;porting its wings be|neath the beams of the &s;un!" <HI>O my dove! that art in the clefts of the rock, in the &s;ecret places of the &s;tairs, let me &s;ee thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for &s;weet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</HI> S. Song ii. 14.</P>
<P>From the peru&s;al of the &s;cripture, and from the analogy of experience of chri&s;tians, we may further perceive the ju&s;tne&s;s of their compari&s;on to doves. In their repentance <HI>they are like doves of the val|leys, all of them mourning, every one for his ini|quity.</HI> Ezek. vii. 16. In their conver&s;ion they ea|gerly fly to Chri&s;t, and to his hou&s;e, <HI>as doves to their window,</HI> for &s;afety and for happine&s;s. I&s;a.
<PB N="230" REF="038552_0232_10125A4F634D0490">
lx. 8. The knowledge of their God, and of his truth, is like <HI>the eyes of a dove,</HI> cha&s;te and pure. S. Song i. 15. Often pur&s;ued and afflicted by ene|mies, they cry, with David, <HI>O that I had wings like a dove: for then would I fly away, and be at re&s;t.</HI> P&s;a. lv. 6. In the temper of their minds, like the innocent dove, they po&s;&s;e&s;s not the <HI>gall</HI> of malicious revenge, but follow the precept of their Lord, <HI>Be ye wi&s;e as &s;erpents, and harmle&s;s as doves.</HI> Matt. x. 16. To which may be added, in their &s;ocial union with the &s;aints in the church, they are faithful and affectionate, and, like the dove, on the lo&s;s of its mate, is afflicted and mourns, <HI>though not without hope.</HI> 1 Thes. iv. 13. Their food, like the food of the dove, is clean and pure&mdash;the fine&s;t of the wheat, the truth of Chri&s;t and of his word, avoiding the carrion of error or vile &s;en&s;u|ality. P&s;a. cxix. 140. Of all the winged creation, what bird more amiably and excellently &s;ets forth its Maker's prai&s;e than the dove? And, of the redeemed of the Lord it is &s;aid, <HI>this</HI> people have I formed for my&s;elf&mdash;they &s;hall &s;hew forth my prai&s;e! I&s;a. xliii. 21.</P>
<P>To make any remarks on the dove &s;ent by Noah out of the ark, or on the dove appointed by the Jewi&s;h law for &s;acrifice, however fruitful of in|&s;truction, mu&s;t now be omitted, as it would una|voidably exceed the limits of this paper.</P>

<HEAD>GLEANINGS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. GOOD works, like the golden ear-rings of the I&s;raelites, are valuable in them&s;elves; but if once exalted into a golden calf, to be wor&s;hipped, they become offen&s;ive to God, and pernicious to the &s;oul.</P>
<P N="2">2. Paulinus, when they told him that the Goths had &s;acked Nola, and plundered him of all he had, lifted up his eyes to Heaven, &s;aid, "<HI>Lord, thou knowe&s;t where I have laid up my trea&s;ure.</HI>"&mdash;Happy the &s;uffering chri&s;tian, who, under lo&s;s of worldly enjoyments, finds durable riches and &s;ub|&s;tance in God!</P>
<P N="3">3. The truths of the Go&s;pel are to be introduced in public di&s;cour&s;es and in private conver&s;ation, with di&s;cretion and propriety. A per&s;on once ha|rangued on the &s;trength of Samp&s;on: "I affirm," &s;aid he, "that this &s;ame Samp&s;on was the &s;tronge&s;t man that ever did or ever will live in this world." "I deny it," replied one of the company; "your|&s;elf are &s;tronger than he." "How do you make out that?" "Becau&s;e you ju&s;t now lugged him in by head and &s;houlders."</P>
<P N="4">4. Young chri&s;tians are frequently great <HI>bigots.</HI> When we are fir&s;t converted to God, our brotherly
<PB N="232" REF="038552_0234_10125A559F6717D0">
affection, candour, and religious opinion of others, too often re&s;emble the narrowne&s;s of a river at its fir&s;t ri&s;e; but as we grow in the knowledge of our|&s;elves, and advance &s;en&s;ibly nearer to God, the great ocean of all good, the channel widens, and our hearts expand, until death perfectly unites us to the &s;ource of uncreated love.</P>
<P N="5">5. If a per&s;on who has been long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large e&s;tate, comes, in proce&s;s of time, to have his <HI>title</HI> di&s;puted, he rummages every corner of his &s;crutore, and of his &s;trong boxes, to find the ori|ginal deeds; which, having found, he appeals to them with confidence, as authentic vouchers.&mdash;Thus, pa&s;t experiences of the grace of God, though not our Saviour, may yet be recollected, and improved as the hand-writing of God, by which we know our intere&s;t in his love, and an&s;wer the cavils and law-&s;uits of the devil.</P>

<P>THE &s;tudy of human nature is plea&s;ing and im|portant. As there are comparatively few le&s;&s;ons on this &s;ubject to be derived from nature, the God

of Grace hath given us the revelation of truth by his dear Son; in which, by the aid of his Spirit, every thing may be known nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute our pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s. Hence, nature and revelation are harmonious; though the latter not only &s;upplies the deficiency of the former, but adds &s;uch di&s;coveries as are &s;uited to our fallen na|ture, and directs us to &s;uch &s;ources of peace and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s which otherwi&s;e never could have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ained. In the volume of revelation we are taught the knowledge of our&s;elves, by the mo&s;t familiar and expre&s;&s;ive figures: that of a FLOWER &s;hall now engage our meditations.</P>
<P>God's ancient &s;ervant, Job, contemplated his own life under this emblem. <HI>Man cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down.</HI> Job xii. 2. He was a wi&s;e and a good man. His knowledge of the &s;ciences and of human nature was great. The brevity of man was ju&s;tly to be compared to a flower; and of this he was the more convinced from his per&s;onal experience in life. As a flower he came forth, and &s;tood an ornament of virtue, grace, and godline&s;s, <HI>fearing God above many,</HI> while his family and his country enjoyed him with infinite plea&s;ure. Health and &s;trength, children and friends, hou&s;e and lands, invaluable riches, were his portion. But, while in his faire&s;t, fulle&s;t
<PB N="243" REF="038552_0245_10122A0BBAC9D9B8">
bloom, he was cut down by the hand of affliction, and his beauty and worth apparently lo&s;t: his health is decayed&mdash;his children are no more&mdash;his va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are carried off by the Sabeans&mdash;his body is covered with biles, and his bed is a filthy dung|hill of the earth; and that hand which was indu&s;|triou&s;ly employed in communicating good to others, now gra&s;ps the pot&s;herd to clean&s;e the &s;ores of the body. Who but mu&s;t drop a tear on reviewing the afflictive change of &s;o excellent a man! Well might he indeed &s;ay, <HI>Man is of few days, and full of trouble.</HI> In the morning, as a flower full in its bloom; in the evening, cut down and wither|ed! But this is not only true, as it relates to the afflictive di&s;pen&s;ation of God to his people, but to the &s;tate of man, by life and by death. He cometh forth as a flower, and appears in all the &s;tages of manhood, and is then cut down by death, and con|&s;igned to the du&s;t. This is a truth that bears its own evidence, and &s;hould make &s;olemn impre&s;&s;ion upon our hearts! We will attempt to enlarge our reflections upon man as a flower, in expecta|tion of u&s;efulne&s;s to the different cla&s;&s;es of our readers.</P>
<P N="1">1. We may begin with its origin. Every flower dictates to us a &s;eed or fir&s;t principle, which owes its exi&s;tence to the Creator of all things, who hath
<PB N="244" REF="038552_0246_10125A71E43F1D20">
<HI>given to every &s;eed its own body.</HI> 1 Cor. xv.&mdash;38. God is the parent of man; <HI>we are his offspring;</HI> and it is <HI>in him that we live, move, and have our being.</HI> The formation of the fir&s;t man, Adam, is recorded, for our in&s;truction, in the two fir&s;t chap|ters of Gene&s;is; the antiquity of which record &s;hould create a &s;uperlative e&s;teem in our brea&s;ts for the bible, as the olde&s;t and the be&s;t book in the world. Our parents&mdash;time, place, and manner of our birth, were appointed by infinite wi&s;dom; and however we may e&s;teem our parents as the natural cau&s;e of our animal production, we mu&s;t direct our eyes to God as the FATHER of all; by who&s;e will and power our bodies and &s;ouls are formed, and who&s;e hand &s;ows the &s;eed that produces the flowers of human nature.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us mark the variety of the flowery tribe, expre&s;&s;ive of the different orders of mankind. In tho&s;e parts of the world where the flowery tribes have been cultivated with every po&s;&s;ible art and in|du&s;try, the flori&s;t has acknowledged that he could no more e&s;timate their variety than to number the &s;ands on the &s;ea &s;hore. A Linnaeus, a Turnfoot, and a Miller, the mo&s;t eminent in exploring the nature, virtue and beauty of this charming part of creation, have only been able to glance upon the &s;ubject, in compari&s;on to its extent. This will
<PB N="245" REF="038552_0247_10125A74636FE258">
aid our reflections on the variety of proportions, &s;ymmetry and features of mankind. In the natural features of men, there may appear two, perhaps, from family connections, &s;o much alike as though ca&s;t into one mould; but, on a minute examina|tion, will be found to differ in a very a&s;toni&s;hing degree. While this diver&s;ity of human features evinces the wi&s;dom of God, it is evidently of the highe&s;t advantages to public &s;ociety. The variety of man's natural and acquired abilities is equally a&s;toni&s;hing! In the lower department of manu|facture, hu&s;bandry, &amp;c. in which the hone&s;t la|bourer obtains his bread at the &s;weat of his brow, the higher departments of language and of arts each bear &s;ome re&s;emblance to the diver&s;ity of flowers. And, as from the variety of flowers many medicinal virtues may be derived for the be|nefit of mankind, &s;o, by the different abilities of men, in the cultivation of &s;cience, benefit is de|rived by the whole. The tempers and pa&s;&s;ions of mankind are likewi&s;e expre&s;&s;ed by the variety of flowers. I pre&s;ume, though there may be &s;ome analogy in the general di&s;po&s;itions of men, yet as their features, &s;o in their minds, there are not two alike, let their name or family be what they may. What an infinite variety is there in the colour, marks, &s;ize, and con&s;truction of flowers! Some
<PB N="246" REF="038552_0248_10125A7601924090">
appear magnificently grand, and fill us with ad|miration; while others, le&s;s adorned, give us leave to pa&s;s without attention. Ju&s;t &s;o it is with men. Tho&s;e who&s;e temper and pa&s;&s;ions are eminent in goodne&s;s and grace, bearing the image of JESUS CHRIST, engage our attention; while others, of a different ca&s;t, make no plea&s;ing impre&s;&s;ion upon us, and we pa&s;s by them with indifference. From the&s;e ob&s;ervations it mu&s;t appear obvious to my young readers, that a general acquaintance with mankind is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to their improve|ment and u&s;efulne&s;s in the world. We meet with &s;ome per&s;ons exceedingly contracted in their gene|ral &s;entiments, and who will &s;carce allow a man to be either hone&s;t or gracious, becau&s;e &s;uch may differ from them: but it is obvious that the&s;e very per&s;ons have only viewed a few flowers in their own &s;canty gardens, and are perfect &s;trangers to that rich variety which adorns the univer&s;e. Con|fining them&s;elves to a circle of their own ta&s;te, they can have little plea&s;ure from the exerci&s;e of chri&s;tian candour towards others.</P>
<P N="3">3. The properties of flowers attracting our <HI>&s;en&s;es</HI> is another ob&s;ervation worthy our attention. Some po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t charming fragrance; others as truly offen&s;ive; while &s;ome may be denominated <HI>neutral,</HI> having little &s;cent at all. It is &s;o among mankind.
<PB N="247" REF="038552_0249_10125A78DBDDC230">
Tho&s;e who are enriched with the grace of God, and, from love to Chri&s;t, bear the fruits of virtue and true holine&s;s, laying out them&s;elves for the be|fit of others&mdash;the&s;e are <HI>the excellent of the earth,</HI> and yield more plea&s;ure to a pious mind, than the mo&s;t valuable collections of carnations can gratify the &s;cent. The vicious, the vain, the wretched and profligate, fail not to render them&s;elves noxious in our e&s;teem. Others there are who are not vi|cious enough to claim the denomination of <HI>wicked,</HI> nor have goodne&s;s enough to e&s;teem them <HI>righte|ous;</HI> therefore, as they are undetermined in their own characters, you find that they pa&s;s through life little thought of, and of as little u&s;e. The&s;e ob&s;ervations may apply in our general review of human nature, or in circum&s;cribed bodies. King|doms, cities, churches, families, are as &s;o many beds of flowers, to be vi&s;ited and enjoyed accord|ing to their nature; while the exhibition of the whole will not fail to enlarge your own brea&s;t, and lead you to admire the goodne&s;s, power and glory of that ALMIGHTY BEING <HI>for whom all things were created.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The general divi&s;ion of flowers of the <HI>field,</HI> and flowers of the <HI>garden,</HI> de&s;erves a few atten|tive thoughts. No doubt, the whole of this flowery tribe was naturally wild; and the choice, culture,
<PB N="248" REF="038552_0250_10125A7C39CCB120">
and benefit of any, by which the difference is made, is attributed to the plea&s;ure and the &s;kill of the flo|ri&s;t and the botani&s;t. As the &s;cripture mu&s;t guide us in the&s;e contemplations, we ob&s;erve the differ|ence made in mankind by the grace and plea&s;ure of God in Chri&s;t. By nature we are all wild in|deed! <HI>By nature children of wrath.</HI> Eph. ii. 1. Chri&s;t, by his grace, regenerating a &s;inner's heart, digs him out from among the common field of the world, and tran&s;plants him into the garden of his church, where he is watered, dre&s;&s;ed, trained, bud, blo&s;&s;om, bear fruit, even to old age. <HI>Ble&s;|&s;ed is the man whom thou, O Lord, choo&s;eth, and cau&s;eth to approach unto thee! He &s;hall be as a plant, planted by the rivers of waters, who&s;e leaf faileth not!</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The &s;hortne&s;s of our paper reminds us to make our la&s;t ob&s;ervation. This mu&s;t be on the period of the flower. <HI>Job tells us, Man cometh up as a flower, and is cut down.</HI> Behold! he &s;peaks of the appearance of the flower, and of its being cut down&mdash;not one word of its continuance. This is purpo&s;ely to teach us the brevity of life, and that our age is, comparatively, as nothing&mdash;<HI>a vapour that vani&s;heth away!</HI> no &s;ooner come up, than cut down! <HI>Lord, what is man!</HI> how few his days on earth! cut down by the &s;cythe of
<PB N="249" REF="038552_0251_10125A7EB5945AB8">
death, at the command of that righteous Being who made us, and to whom we are accountable! At this &s;pot our leaves mu&s;t fall, our beauty fade! But is man cut down to be no more? Doth body and &s;oul both lie down in the grave, and rot to|gether? How important the que&s;tion of Job:&mdash;<HI>Man giveth up the Gho&s;t, and where is he?</HI> Job xiv. 10. May I be permitted, in reverence, to reply&mdash;Either in HEAVEN or HELL! Cut down as fuel for the fire&mdash;or to be tran&s;mitted to bloom in paradi&s;e with God! Let us, therefore, improve the&s;e reflections for our per&s;onal benefit; let us examine into the &s;tate of our &s;ouls, and fly to the arms of that mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who, to teach his worth, and to yield his grace, is known as <HI>the Ro&s;e of Sharon, and the Lily of the Val|lies.</HI> Intere&s;ted in him, and fraught with his grace, you need not fear to die. Though cut down by the hand of death, you &s;hall be delivered from this evil, tempe&s;tuous life, and be tran&s;mitted to bli&s;s that <HI>fadeth not away!</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. A CHRISTIAN, as to his &s;piritual enjoy|ments, is not unlike a BAROMETER. As the quick|&s;ilver, in this in&s;trument, ri&s;es when the &s;un &s;hines,

<P N="2">2. Dr. Grove&s;nor being at the funeral of Dr. Watts, a gentleman pre&s;ent &s;aid to him, "Well, Dr. Grove&s;nor, you have &s;een the end of Dr. Watts, and you will &s;oon follow: what think you of death?" "Think of it," replied the Doc|tor, "when death comes I &s;hall &s;mile upon death, if Chri&s;t &s;miles upon me."</P>
<P N="3">3. When the rays of the &s;un fall on the &s;urface of a material object, part of tho&s;e rays are ab&s;orb|ed, part of them are reflected back in &s;traight lines, and part of them are refracted in various directions. Thus, when Chri&s;t, the SUN OF RIGHTEOUS|NESS, &s;hines upon a chri&s;tian's heart, part of the grace he confers is <HI>ab&s;orbed</HI> for the con&s;olation of the &s;oul; part of it is <HI>reflected</HI> back to the Saviour, in acts of faith, love, joy, prayer and prai&s;e; and part of it is <HI>refracted</HI> every way, in acts of for|bearance, gratitude, benevolence, and every &s;ocial virtue, for the benefit of mankind.</P>

<P>Your fir&s;t blow is well directed; for if they can be impeached, the whole, of cour&s;e, mu&s;t fall. If men fabricated the &s;criptures, we may ju&s;tly a&s;k, What men were they? Either bad or good. The fir&s;t could not have contrived it, and the latter never would have done it. The doc|trines, the precepts, would be the rever&s;e of their own nature. Would &s;uch men write a book to tell all the world that all &s;uch men as them&s;elves would be puni&s;hed in hell? Good men would never make a book out of their own heads, and then tell you that their lies were the coun&s;els of God. If men did counterfeit God's hand, how has it happened that none has di&s;covered the cheat? What! were they all deceivers? Tell me for why? What could be the motive that induced them to &s;uch an impo&s;ition, where they &s;aw reproach, im|pri&s;onment, torture, and death, their own rewards? Would no one out of the many repent, and di&s;|clo&s;e the &s;cheme, even when he found the world again&s;t him, and death before him? Could ba&s;e lyars, wicked men, write a book &s;o pure in its na|ture, and holy in its de&s;ign, and endure all manner of hard&s;hips in defence of it? Even the character and conduct of <HI>Judas I&s;cariot</HI> furni&s;hes a &s;trong
<PB N="256" REF="038552_0258_10125A90B01A06A0">
argument for the truth of the go&s;pel. How came it to pa&s;s that he fir&s;t betrayed his ma&s;ter, and was then &s;o &s;tung with remor&s;e as to put an end to his own life? How came he thus to own him&s;elf guilty of the vile&s;t &s;in, when, if Je&s;us had been an impo&s;tor, he knew that he had done an act of ju&s;tice to the world in freeing them from him? Now, if there had been any ba&s;e plot, any bad de&s;ign in the ca&s;e, Judas, who had &s;o long lived with Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples, with perfect intimacy, and who was intru&s;ted with the bag, would cer|tainly have expo&s;ed it. I wi&s;h to a&s;k you if you have thoroughly examined the characters of the different writers of the Old and New Te&s;taments? Perhaps not. You would have found that they feared God; they lived a life of prayer to God; they &s;eparated them&s;elves from the practices of the wicked; they preached, they wrote, they wept, to reclaim their fellow mortals; and they cheerfully &s;ubmitted to every lo&s;s of name, health, friends, and property, to accompli&s;h &s;uch benevolent pur|po&s;es, all of which they unanimou&s;ly aimed at the glory of God! Is there any thing here impeach|able? Or ought we not to admire their character, and follow their &s;teps? Are the &s;ocial virtues of the oppo&s;ers of chri&s;tianity more u&s;eful and brilliant?

I will ju&s;t add, that the &s;criptures, however written by different men, of different languages, and di&s;tant periods, every part of them harmonize in pointing out the mo&s;t augu&s;t character of Jehovah, the mi&s;erable &s;tate of man by &s;in, the completene&s;s of redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the power of the Spirit in applying the vir|tues of &s;alvation to the heart, the privileges of the godly in this life, and their glory in the next. Each of the&s;e are minutely expre&s;&s;ed, are ea&s;ily under&s;tood by an illuminated mind, and afford ground and rea&s;ons for moral and &s;ocial actions, infinitely plainer and more certain than the variety of axioms in natural and experimental philo&s;ophy. I conclude my an&s;wer to your que&s;tion nearly in the words of the celebrated <HI>Dryden:</HI> "Whence but from heaven could men who were generally un&s;killed in arts, who were born in different pe|riods of time, and in different parts of the world, weave &s;uch agreeing truths?

<P>Indeed, good Sir, I feel already &s;o guilty and a&s;hamed, for di&s;believing what I did not know, that I know not how to proceed: however, having your leave, I will tre&s;pa&s;s upon your patience once more.

<P>True: we have to lament that &s;ome pro|fe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity have and do act improperly; but &s;hould the whole be condemned for the &s;ake of a few? or &s;hould this be laid as an evil to the charge of chri&s;tianity? Certainly not. If there was no intrin&s;ic value in chri&s;tianity, there would be no counterfeit: if there were no real chri&s;tians, there would be no hypocrites. All tho&s;e torrents of blood, &s;hed by what are called chri&s;tian princes, were not the dictates, nor the fruit of chri&s;tianity; but the lu&s;t of ambition, revenge, and love of con|que&s;t. Probably this objection may al&s;o ari&s;e from your per&s;onal ob&s;ervations on profe&s;&s;ors of the go&s;pel. In this ca&s;e I will &s;ay, I al&s;o have been deeply affected when witne&s;&s;ing improper con|duct of &s;uch per&s;ons. But, on due reflection on the extreme depravity of the heart, and the many enticements to evil, I have been more a&s;toni&s;hed
<PB N="260" REF="038552_0262_10125A9B100355B0">
that <HI>any</HI> live an honour to God, u&s;eful to &s;ociety, and happy in them&s;elves, than that a greater num|ber &s;hould not. It is not uncommon for tho&s;e who are unfavourable to the go&s;pel to u&s;e <HI>both</HI> eyes to mark the improprieties of its followers, and &s;carce ever glance upon their own conduct. Very different from this is the temper dictated by the bible: for, in&s;tead of being like the vulture, prey|ing upon the carrion of others' conduct, they are clothed with humility, under a due &s;en&s;e of their own infirmities. I readily own to you, my young friend, if I have hitherto maintained a life in any mea&s;ure con&s;i&s;tent with the office I hold in col|lege, or beneficial to &s;ociety at large, I wholly at|tribute it to the kind influence of my God and Sa|viour upon my heart. Your propo&s;ed objection gives me an opportunity to name two other argu|ments favourable to chri&s;tianity, and, I think, mu&s;t prove alleviating to you. The very bible has pre|dicted tho&s;e fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ors of whom you com|plain, and marked out both their conduct and their end. Read, as a proof, the parable of the ten virgins. Matt. xxv. 1&mdash;13. Another argument is, God has not hidden any of the evils and impro|prieties of his mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ervants; but has lain the blacke&s;t mark upon them, and &s;hown their ju&s;t aggravations for their repentance; and they

&s;till exi&s;t on record, that <HI>he who thinketh he &s;tandeth may take heed le&s;t he fall.</HI> 1 Cor. x. 12. Remember, chri&s;tianity makes no man per&s;onally &s;inle&s;s, but corrects and &s;ubdues our evil nature. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the oppo&s;ers of chri&s;tianity are not more brilliant in their moral virtues than others; neither, while they reflect upon our bible, do they po&s;&s;e&s;s wi&s;dom and benevolence &s;ufficient to give us a better rule of life, and a ground of hope. A celebrated dei&s;t once had candour enough to acknowledge to me, in Bo&s;ton, "Sir, after all our di&s;putes with you on the &s;ubject of chri&s;tianity, I mu&s;t own that you have <HI>two</HI> chances to our <HI>one.</HI> If we are right, and our &s;tanding &s;afe on the ground of nature, you mu&s;t be al&s;o.

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON JOB xiv. 20. <HI>Thou change&s;t his countenance, and &s;ende&s;t him away.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BY &s;in came death: God's <HI>&s;entence prevaileth forever again&s;t</HI> man, <HI>and he pa&s;&s;eth away</HI>&mdash;from life to death, from time to eternity, from a &s;tate of action to a &s;tate of judgment! Yes, thou, Lord, change&s;t his countenance, and &s;ende&s;t him away. How ju&s;t the procedure; how &s;ublime the &s;enti|ment! fruitful of in&s;truction to every attentive mind. It has been &s;trikingly verified in the per|&s;on of Je&s;us, and is daily &s;o, in the departure both of the wicked and the righteous by death.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the per&s;on of Je&s;us, who&s;e countenance was <HI>fairer than the children of men, grace</HI> with|out mea&s;ure <HI>was poured into his lips.</HI> P&s;a. xlv. 2. His countenance was the index, the mirror, through which all the variety of human pa&s;&s;ions and qualities were &s;een, that once rendered him familiar with

mortals, and proved him to be, indeed, the SON OF GOD. But the FATHER had &s;ent him into the world to be the Saviour of &s;inners, to atone for &s;in, and to ran&s;om his people from the power of the grave. His countenance, therefore, mu&s;t be changed, and exhibit to men, to angels and to devils, the torture which his &s;oul &s;hould endure in accompli&s;hing his de&s;ign. As he advanced into natural, active life, he became <HI>a man of &s;orrow, and acquainted with griefs;</HI> and, during the la&s;t few weeks of his abode on earth, his countenance was changed in &s;uch a variety of ways as mu&s;t fill the contemplative &s;oul with &s;olemn awe.</P>
<P>Preparatory to his future dreadful &s;ufferings, and his con&s;equent exaltation, Je&s;us was transfi|gured upon Mount Tabor: in the very exerci&s;e of prayer <HI>his face did &s;hine as the &s;un.</HI> Matt. xvii. 2. Immediately after, he met his di&s;ciples at the pa&s;&s;|over, and in&s;tituted the memorials of his own fu|ture death, while his countenance beamed friend|&s;hip and love to them all. From thence he repaired to Gath&s;emane, when a change took place in his countenance that &s;pake the awful &s;orrow of his &s;oul, and the bloody &s;weat of his body in pro&s;pect of that cup which his Father de&s;igned him to drink! At the bar of the high prie&s;t his counte|nance was again changed, by the &s;pitting and the

Removed from the cro&s;s, attend his corp&s;e in Jo&s;eph's garden, prepared for its tomb; and behold his countenance now changed by death! Ah, my &s;oul! can&s;t thou behold the&s;e changes of thy Saviour's countenance without a tear? Shall not repentance flow from thy guilty brea&s;t, while Je&s;us weeps, and bleeds, and dies!

Then he was <HI>&s;ent away</HI> from earth to heaven, accompa|nied by multitudes of angels, and was &s;et down at the right hand of the Maje&s;ty on high, as the re|pre&s;entative of his people; to conquer, by his grace, the purcha&s;e of his blood, and to prepare man&s;ions of glory for them, where they &s;hall en|joy the light of his countenance for ever!

<P>When I my&s;elf review the path of life, &s;eriou&s;|ly contemplate God's conduct towards me, in the multiplied affections and mercies which, in clo&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, have followed me, I am filled with humble prai&s;e.

MEMORIAL OF GENERAL WASHINGTON.</HEAD>
<P>IN righteous judgment heaven hath appointed unto &s;inful man <HI>once to die.</HI> The &s;hafts of death fly thick around. The beggar and the lonely pea|&s;ant receive the &s;ummons, and are conveyed to the du&s;t in &s;ilence, and without regret. The prince upon his throne, the noble and the great, receive an equal, deadly blow; and, with &s;olemn pomp, are laid within the marble tomb. The mortal part of WASHINGTON is removed to the &s;hades of death, and America drops the mourning tear; while her mo&s;t patriotic &s;ons advance, each as with a
<PB N="280" REF="038552_0282_10125ACDA6C83900">
laurel in his hand to decorate the great man's grave! His birth, his youth, his manhood; his qualities in private life, his valour in the field, and his wi&s;dom in the &s;enate; "fir&s;t in war, fir&s;t in peace, and fir&s;t upon his country's heart!" the&s;e eminent traits have formed a &s;ubject for the orator and the pane|gyri&s;t &s;o new and a&s;toni&s;hing, as &s;eldom occurs in the world of letters. While others joined the nu|merous, mourning train, and the more eloquent lips publicly pourtrayed his political character, te&s;|tifying the re&s;pect in which the people of America held their beloved chief, I will gratify my&s;elf (as more accordant to his la&s;t will and te&s;tament) by clo&s;ing this volume of "The Chri&s;tian's Pocket Library," in rai&s;ing a plain, private MEMORIAL of WASHINGTON, as a di&s;tingui&s;hed SERVANT OF GOD, the MAN whom the Lord hath delighted to honour in e&s;tabli&s;hing the <HI>only</HI> government, then exi&s;ting upon earth, where the perfection of reli|gious liberty is enjoyed by all, and the church of God &s;tands upon its &s;piritual ba&s;is, unconnected with civil power.</P>
<P>We will attempt to rai&s;e this memorial upon the back ground of a review of the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion as engrafted in the &s;tock of civil government. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour declared, <HI>my kingdom is not of this world.</HI> John xviii. 36. Its nature, &s;ubjects, laws,
<PB N="281" REF="038552_0283_10125AD026A91070">
government, privileges, trea&s;ures, are wholly &s;piritual and divine; tending to prepare the &s;ouls of men for a future &s;tate of endle&s;s bli&s;s. No &s;ooner did the cau&s;e of Je&s;us begin to increa&s;e, than civil governments, of different de&s;criptions and of dif|ferent countries, planted a <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of chri&s;tianity into the very heart of their political con&s;titutions. Immediately the primitive &s;implicity and &s;pirit of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible kingdom vani&s;hed; it became a tool of &s;tate, and a pretext for committing the mo&s;t daring depredations among&s;t mankind; which political bodies were not a&s;hamed to call them THE WARS OF THE LORD. No wonder that, from &s;uch an union of church and &s;tate, whether deno|minated <HI>papal</HI> or <HI>prote&s;tant,</HI> the ordinances and laws of chri&s;tianity &s;hould be gro&s;sly mutilated, in|tentionally to render them &s;ub&s;ervient to political purpo&s;es, and that a variety of officers &s;hould be introduced who&s;e names and functions are unknown in the New Te&s;tament, to carry on the wheels of &s;tate, and to produce the temporal good of the whole. Again&s;t &s;uch an heterogeneous ma&s;s, and under &s;uch features, no wonder the &s;cattered <HI>He|brew race</HI> &s;hould increa&s;e in prejudice again&s;t chri&s;tianity, and that the <HI>heathen-world</HI> &s;hould abominate that &s;y&s;tem who&s;e fruit was rapine, cruelty, and blood&s;hed! Under &s;uch mixed go|vernments,
<PB N="282" REF="038552_0284_10125AD1C3599310">
all who pre&s;umed to attach them&s;elves to the &s;piritual kingdom of Chri&s;t, di&s;claiming all civil authority in matters of con&s;cience, faith, and religious practice, were held in contempt, excluded from the particular rights of citizens, and frequently <HI>accounted as &s;heep for the &s;laughter.</HI> Thus, a profe&s;&s;ion of the religion of Je&s;us, who&s;e primitive nature is benevolence and love, was corrupted, and became the fountain of partiality, tyranny, bond|age, hatred, and wrath, &s;eparating the very &s;ouls it was calculated to unite, and <HI>&s;cattering arrows, fire-brands and death</HI> over the world, which it was intended to reclaim.</P>
<P>In what part of Chri&s;tendom was it that this mo&s;t wretched &s;pirit did not prevail? In what country has <HI>the kingdom of Chri&s;t</HI> been univer|&s;ally profe&s;&s;ed, as entirely di&s;tinct from the civil powers? In none. Even AMERICA, though emerged from heathen darkne&s;s, and cultivated by European hands, &s;at amid&s;t the &s;ame corrupted ma&s;s of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tic powers. But God de&s;ignated her for a better &s;tate. Increa&s;ing in her wealth, her years tender, &s;he felt the galling fetters on her hand! At length &s;he &s;ighed&mdash;&s;he groaned&mdash;&s;he wept beneath her load. But ah! who&s;e eye could pity? What arm &s;ufficient to relieve a ca&s;e like her's? That ALMIGHTY BEING who taught
<PB N="283" REF="038552_0285_10125AD35F4D84F0">
<HI>Columbus</HI> to explore her hidden &s;hores, beheld her &s;uffering &s;tate, and deigned to relieve! He who rai&s;ed <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to deliver the cho&s;en race of I&s;rael, and girded the arm of <HI>Cirus</HI> to unfold the ma&s;&s;y gates of Babylon, will rai&s;e a deliverer to &s;et Ame|rica free. Behold a WASHINGTON ari&s;e! Hea|ven in&s;pires his &s;oul with wi&s;dom, fortitude, and love&mdash;<HI>teacheth his hands to war, and his fingers to fight.</HI> And, left he &s;hould boa&s;t, <HI>my own arm hath gotten me the victory,</HI> God committeth to his command an handful of raw, undi&s;ciplined men, de&s;titute of almo&s;t every equipment for the field, but ardent thir&s;t to &s;et their country free. Through &s;even long years of horrid war, in hopes and fears, in &s;weat and blood, the GENERAL urged his way. At length heaven opens, and lets down upon his &s;ervant's head the VICTOR'S CROWN. Now the fabric of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tic powers, long com|bined, in one cra&s;h fall, like the walls of antient Jericho. Peace, with her thou&s;and thou&s;and &s;weets, extends through all the land, and every pious heart exclaims, <HI>Hallelujah! for the Lord God Omni|potent reigneth.</HI> Now, <HI>the Lord judgeth among many people, and rebuketh &s;trong nations afar off.</HI> The &s;ons of America <HI>beat their &s;words into plough&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning-hooks. Every man &s;its under his vine and under his fig-tree,
<PB N="284" REF="038552_0286_10125AD6E89C7FE8">
and none maketh them afraid.</HI> Micah iv. 3. 4. <HI>O &s;ing unto the Lord a new &s;ong, for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory.</HI> P&s;a. xcviii. 1. And while &s;uch effu&s;ions of grati|tude flow to the Almighty for our deliverance and independence, can we po&s;&s;ibly forget the MAN whom the Lord hath delighted to honour, in mar|tialling our armies, and obtaining our victory? Impo&s;&s;ible! Though WASHINGTON be now numbered among the dead, his name &s;hall live with millions yet unborn.</P>
<P>Thus far we &s;peak but half his prai&s;e. The people &s;aved were yet without &s;ufficient <HI>law.</HI> The peace obtained mu&s;t be &s;ecured. The MAN whom heaven ble&s;&s;ed in the fields of war now takes the pre&s;idential chair, in full CONVENTION, with a circle of worthies, cho&s;en by the free &s;uffrage of the people, to frame a CONSTITUTION, by which the rights, the liberties, the wealth and happine&s;s of all may be pre&s;erved. On this &s;trong ba&s;is every STATE builds a &s;uper&s;tructure of peace and commerce, while di&s;tant nations give a friend's em|brace.</P>
<P>Civil rights and liberties are &s;weet; but &s;weeter &s;till the &s;acred rights of con&s;cience. This ble&s;&s;ing, too, flows to us from God in copious &s;treams,
<PB N="285" REF="038552_0287_10125ADA4F16BF48">
through the Con&s;titution of the United States. No te&s;t-act here; no fines nor chains; no horrid in|qui&s;ition nor flaming faggots prepared for tho&s;e who differ in faith and practice from their fellow mortals for con&s;cience &s;ake. Here the &s;tandard of the CROSS appears, and the voice of Je&s;us &s;ounds aloud&mdash;<HI>My kingdom is not of this world.</HI> Hail, thou fir&s;t &s;pot of earth, con&s;ecrated by IMMANUEL'S benediction, to &s;how his arm in re&s;cuing his church from the civil powers, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">and alone upon the pure un&s;haken ba&s;is of his truth and grace! Fir&s;t fruit of the Redeemer's national conque&s;t! Go on, mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Lord, in the glory of thy might, over|turning the powers of darkne&s;s, until thou &s;halt reign king of nations, as thou art king of grace, diffu&s;ing cele&s;tial knowledge both to Jew and Gen|tile, and &s;acred liberty prevails from pole to pole. Thus, while every American's knee &s;hall bow be|fore the Lord, and their lips, in pure&s;t gratitude, prai&s;e his glorious name for his boundle&s;s mercies, let the memory of WASHINGTON, through whom the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings came, be engraven upon every heart. Not one exempt! Tho&s;e who&s;e judgments may not accord in &s;ome recent traits of this great man's coun&s;el, mu&s;t unite with me in venerating his name as a di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ervant of the Lord, in
<PB N="286" REF="038552_0288_10122A0E129E9618">
procuring tho&s;e &s;treams of civil and religious li|berty, unknown in other lands.</P>
<P>What man, elevated to &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing height of honour, and &s;o &s;ignally favoured by the victorious arm of God, that ever wore the AR|MOUR with &s;uch diffidence and profound humility? Which, among tho&s;e numerous conquerors who&s;e names adorn the page of ancient and modern hi&s;tory, have maintained &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of moral VIR|TUES as &s;hone through the diver&s;ified &s;tages of WASHINGTON's public life? Alas! although the victor's crown was placed on their heads, what &s;pots of vice were often &s;een upon their robes, that made their country blu&s;h! Here let America lift her head, nor dare di&s;own her General's name, but hail him&mdash;A SERVANT WORTHY OF THE LORD!</P>
