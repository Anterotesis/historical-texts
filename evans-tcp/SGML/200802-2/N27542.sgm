<L>MY FATHER! cries the <HI>United States,</HI></L>
<L>Pray leave us not our Guide and Light:</L>
<L>The &s;hining Chariot &s;wiftly rolls,</L>
<L>And takes the Patriot from our &s;ight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ab&s;orb'd in grief, with anxious hearts,</L>
<L>Each freeborn Son &s;tands looking round,</L>
<L>In vain they a&s;k in fruitle&s;s &s;earch,</L>
<L>Who has the &s;acred Mantle found?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come noble &s;ouls your tears refrain,</L>
<L>Take from your garb the &s;able hue,</L>
<L>Yonder! above Etherial Skies,</L>
<L>A brighter &s;cene pre&s;ents in view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cele&s;tial Gates unfold your leaves;</L>
<L>The Harpers &s;trike their golden &s;trings,</L>
<L>Around the Arch the mu&s;ic plays,</L>
<L>With &s;houts of joy the Palace rings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thrice welcome from the du&s;ky globe,</L>
<L>Victorious Hero of renown,</L>
<L>Faithful thou wa&s;t on Earth below,</L>
<L>Now take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Crown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This is the man who quell'd his foes,</L>
<L>In virtue's cau&s;e he boldly &s;tood,</L>
<L>When danger &s;tar'd him in the face,</L>
<L>He valu'd not his deare&s;t blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A full reward he now &s;hall meet,</L>
<L>For all the labours of his love:</L>
<L>Regale thy Soul with &s;picy fruits,</L>
<L>On banks of fair EMMANUEL's grove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No longer let the Sacred De&s;ks,</L>
<L>And walls in gloomy Sackcloth mourn,</L>
<L>Far di&s;tant dwells the immortal Man,</L>
<L>That from our eyes was lately borne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cheer up brave Patriots, one and all,</L>
<L>The &s;acred Page a Cordial gives,</L>
<L>If GOD hides <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> for a while,</L>
<L>A Saviour <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> for us lives.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Farewell! none &s;hall his bli&s;s envy,</L>
<L>Who &s;oars beyond the Warriors noi&s;e,</L>
<L>No groans, or garments roll'd in blood,</L>
<L>Shall there mole&s;t his endle&s;s Joys.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>An heavenly Beam illumes our hearts,</L>
<L>We &s;oon &s;hall meet our Friend again</L>
<L>No more to feel a parting &s;troke,</L>
<L>But as triumphant Victors reign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wrote on an <HI>adamantine Stone,</HI></L>
<L>Great WASHINGTON's dear name will &s;tand;</L>
<L>Ages unborn may &s;ing for joy,</L>
<L>His Wi&s;dom &s;av'd our &s;inking Land.</L>
