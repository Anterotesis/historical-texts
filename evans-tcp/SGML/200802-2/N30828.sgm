<OPENER><SALUTE>MEN, BRETHREN and FATHERS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' &s;o many alarming Warnings, pathetick Exhortations, and &s;uitable Directions, have already been given both from the Pre&s;s and Pulpit, by Way of Preparitives to our late publick Day of Humiliation; yet &s;hould one, who is le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all his Brethren, now that Solemnity is over, pre&s;ume to trouble his dear Coun|trymen with a &s;hort Addre&s;s, by Way of Supplement to what hath already been offered, it is to be hoped none will be &s;o unkind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to look upon it altogether as &s;upperfluous and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eedle&s;s, much le&s;s be &s;o ungenerous as to cen&s;ure it as proceeding from the Pride and Naughtine&s;s of his Heart.&mdash;But &s;hould this be the Ca&s;e, I &s;hall make no other Apology (as I think there needs no other) than that which <HI>David</HI> the younge&s;t of the Sons of <HI>Je&s;&s;e</HI> made long ago upon a like Occa&s;ion, "Is there not a Cau&s;e?"</P>
<P>An in&s;ulting, inraged, and perfidious Enemy is now advancing nearer and nearer to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Borders.&mdash;Not content with invading and ravaging our rightful Sovereign King <HI>George'</HI>s Dominions in <HI>America,</HI> our Popi&s;h Adver&s;aries have now the Ambition to attempt, at lea&s;t to threaten, an Inva&s;ion of <HI>England</HI> it&s;elf; hoping, no doubt, thereby not only to throw us into Confu&s;ion at Home, but al&s;o to divert us from more effectually defeating their mali|cious De&s;igns Abroad.&mdash;That &s;uch a De&s;ign (however chimerical it may &s;eem) is now actually on foot, the Royal Proclamation lately i&s;&s;ued forth renders it indi&s;putable.&mdash;Which Procla|motion, as it plainly be&s;peaks his Maje&s;ty's paternal Care, doth at the &s;ame Time loudly call upon all his faithful and loving Subjects, not only to &s;tand upon their Guard, but al&s;o to exert their utmo&s;t Efforts, in Dependance on Divine Protection, to prevent and render abortive &s;uch an unju&s;t and daring Enterprize.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be God, as a profe&s;&s;ing, tho' &s;inful People, we have lately taken one effectual Step towards bringing about &s;uch a &s;alutary End.</P>
<P>In Obedience to a Call from the Throne we have been humbling our&s;elves in the mo&s;t public and &s;olemn Manner before the mo&s;t High God&mdash;And 'tis to be hop'd that the many Tears that were that Day &s;hed, and the thou&s;ands and thou&s;ands of Prayers that were then offer'd up&punc; have long &s;ince been regarded by, and enter'd into the Ears of the Lord of Sab|baoth&mdash;Infidels may perhaps laugh and make them&s;elves merry with &s;uch an In&s;inuation: But &s;erious People (and to &s;uch in a more peculiar Manner is this Addre&s;s directed) will account it no Ways enthu&s;ia&s;tic to affirm that &s;olemn Humiliations, whether performed by public Com|munities in general, or Individuals in particular, have always met with &s;uch a Divine Accep|tance, as to obtain at lea&s;t a Reprieve from, if not a total Removal of, the threatned Evil.&mdash;The deferring of an impending Judgement only upon the hypocritical, but public Humiliation of a wicked <HI>Abe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>&mdash;The mature and providential Deliverance of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> People from the cruel Plot of an ambitious <HI>Haman,</HI> which Queen <HI>Ea&s;ther, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and the other di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Jews</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ought &s;o earne&s;tly for by bublic Fa&s;ting and Prayer&mdash;And what is yet more, the

total and entire Su&s;pen&s;ion of the De&s;truction of <HI>Nineveh,</HI> that exceeding great City, tho' &s;o peremptorily denounced, upon the Fa&s;ting, Praying, and Repenting of the King, Nobles and Commons, at the preaching of <HI>Jonah;</HI> The&s;e, I &s;ay, not to mention many more that might be adduced from &s;acred Story, are mo&s;t pregnant, and, at the &s;ame Time, very encouraging Proofs, that tho&s;e that humble them&s;elves &s;hall in God's due Time be exalted; and that therefore, as a Nation we may bodly infer, that the righteous Lord who delights to &s;hew him&s;elf &s;trong in behalf of tho&s;e who are of an upright Heart, will favour, plead and vindicate our righte|ous Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> In&s;inuations have been indu&s;triou&s;ly publi&s;hed, in order to lay all the Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me of this War upon us.&mdash;But bold A&s;&s;ertions and &s;olid Proofs are two different Things&punc;&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or it is plain, beyond all Contradiction, that the <HI>French,</HI> fond of rivailing us both at Home <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Abroad, have mo&s;t unju&s;tly invaded his Maje&s;ty's Dominions in <HI>America;</HI> and have al&s;o not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by the mo&s;t vile Artifices and Lies been endeavouring to draw the Six Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> from our Intere&s;t; but, in &s;hort, almo&s;t all their Proceedings ever &s;ince the late Treaty of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> la Chapelle,</HI> have been little el&s;e than Preparations for, or a tacit Declara|tion of War.&mdash;But he that &s;itteth in Heaven, as we may humbly hope, laughs them to Scorn; and, as he once defeated the Coun&s;el of <HI>Achitophel,</HI> and came down to confound the Language of tho&s;e a&s;piring Projectors who would fain have built a Tower, the Top of which &s;hould reach even to Heaven; &s;o we tru&s;t (whatever dark Providences may intervene) that He will in the End fru&s;trate the Devices of our Adver&s;ary's mo&s;t &s;ubtle Politicians, and &s;peak Confu|&s;ion to all their Projects, who, by aiming at univer&s;al Monarchy, are more than attempting to erect a &s;econd <HI>Babel.</HI></P>
<P>I have heard, or read &s;omewhere of a Turki&s;h General, who being call'd to engage with a Chri&s;tian Army that had broken through the mo&s;t &s;olemn Ties, &s;tood up at the Head of his Troops, and then drawing out the Treaty which they had broken out of his Bo&s;om, and holding it up in the Air, thus addre&s;&s;ed the Throne of Heaven:&mdash;<Q>O Almighty Being, if Thou art, as they &s;ay Thou art, the&s;e Chri&s;tians God, Thou love&s;t what is right, and hate&s;t Perfidy; look down therefore and behold this Treaty which they have broken; and, as thou can&s;t not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">avour what is wrong, render their Arms, O God, &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s, and make mine victorious.</Q>&mdash;He ended&mdash;Immediately the Sword was drawn&mdash;The two Parties vigorou&s;ly engaged, and the perfidious Chri&s;tians were beaten off the Field.&mdash;Thus may our Prote&s;tant Generals, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r at lea&s;t their Chaplains, deal with our Enemy's Forces, in Re&s;pect to the Treaty of <HI>Aix-la-Chapelle</HI>&mdash;They, not we, have broken it.&mdash;They, not we, have been the Aggre&s;&s;ors:&mdash;And therefore, notwith&s;tanding we are looked upon as <HI>Hereticks,</HI> and they fight under the Banner of one who &s;tiles him&s;elf <HI>His Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty;</HI> a righteous God, we tru&s;t, in An&s;wer to Prayer, will humble <HI>France,</HI> and make the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Arms both by Sea and Land more than Conquerers thro' his Love.&mdash;It is true, (and God knows, with Grief of Heart I &s;peak it) praying is become too unfa&s;hionable among&s;t our People in general, and among our military Men in particular;&mdash;but wherein either the Piety, and con&s;equently true Policy, of &s;uch a Procedure con&s;i&s;ts, I believe will be very difficult to determine.&mdash;If we have Recour&s;e to Mr. <HI>Rollin'</HI>s Ancient Hi&s;tory, I believe we &s;hall find that neither <HI>Darius, Cyrus, Alexander,</HI> or indeed &s;carce any of the <HI>Egyptian, Grecian, Per&s;ian,</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Generals, ever undertook any hazardous Enterprize, without making &s;ome publick Acknowledgement of a Deity.&mdash;And if we con&s;ult that Hi&s;tory of Hi&s;tories, that too much neglected Book (as Sir <HI>Richard Steel</HI> expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf) emphatically called the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> we may always remark that tho&s;e heroic Worthies, who by Faith &s;ubdued Kingdoms, and put to Flight the Armies of the Aliens, were Men of <HI>Prayer,</HI> as well as Men of Valour.&mdash;And if our Re&s;earches de&s;cend forwards down to our own Annals, we &s;hall &s;oon be &s;atisfied, that the
<HI><PB N="5" REF="040870_0005_101AFF6A1F629F48">
Briti&s;h</HI> Arms were never more formidable than when our Soldiers went forth in the Strength of the Lord, and with a Bible in one Hand, and a Sword in the other, chearfully fought under his Banner, who hath conde&s;cended to &s;tile him&s;elf <HI>a Man of War.</HI></P>
<P>Such an Appellation as this, methinks, may &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify the Lawfulne&s;s of bearing Arms, and drawing the Sword in Defence of our civil and religious Liberties.&mdash;For if God him&s;elf is plea&s;ed to &s;tile him&s;elf a Man of War, &s;urely in a ju&s;t and righteous Cau&s;e (&s;uch as the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> War at pre&s;ent is) we may as lawfully draw our Swords, in order to defend our&s;elves again&s;t our common and public Enemy, as a civil Magi&s;trate may &s;it on a Bench, and condemn a public Robber to Death. Our excellent Reformers, &s;en&s;ible of this, in the thirty-&s;econd Article of our Church, after having declared <Q>that the Laws of the Realm may puni&s;h Chri&s;tian Men with Death, for heinous Offences;</Q> immediately &s;ubjoins, <Q>that it is lawful for Chri&s;tian Men, at the Commandment of the Magi&s;trate, to wear Weapons and &s;erve in the Wars.</Q>&mdash;And therefore, what Bi&s;hop <HI>Saunder&s;on</HI> &s;ays of Study, may be likewi&s;e &s;aid of Fighting: <Q>Fighting without Prayer, is Athei&s;m, and Prayer without Fighting, is Pre&s;umption.</Q>&mdash;And I would be the more particular on this Point, becau&s;e through a fatal Scrupulo&s;ity again&s;t bearing Arms, even in a defen&s;ive War, his Maje&s;ty hath been, and is not yet out of Danger of lo&s;ing that large, exten&s;ive, and that lately mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> the very Centre and Garden of all <HI>North-America.</HI>&mdash;But whil&s;t I &s;ee &s;uch very &s;crupulous Per&s;ons gra&s;ping at every Degree of worldly Power, and by all the Arts of worldly Policy labouring to monopolize and retain in their own Hands all Parts both of the legi&s;lative and executive Branches of Civil Government; to &s;peak in the milde&s;t Terms, we may hone&s;tly affirm, that they certainly act a mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent, and if not prevented here at Home, to Thou&s;ands of their Neighbours, I fear a very fatal Part.&mdash;For, &s;ay what we will to the contrary, if we &s;earch to the Bottom of Things, we may &s;oon be convinced, that Civil Magi&s;tracy and defen&s;ive War mu&s;t &s;tand or fall together.&mdash;Both are built upon the &s;ame Ba&s;is; and there cannot be &s;o much as one &s;ingle Argument urged to e&s;tabli&s;h the one&punc; which doth not at the &s;ame Time corroborate and confirm the other.</P>
<P>Far be it from me, who profe&s;s my &s;elf a Di&s;ciple and Mini&s;ter of the Prince of Peace, to &s;ound a Trumpet for War: But when the Trumpet is already &s;ounded by a perfidious Enemy, and our King, our Country, our civil and religious Liberties are all, as it were, lying at Stake, did we not at &s;uch a Sea&s;on lend our Pur&s;es, our Tongues, our Arms, as well as our Prayers, in Defence of them, &s;hould we not ju&s;tly incur that Cur&s;e which an in&s;pired <HI>Deborah,</HI> when under the immediate Influence of the Holy Spirit, once uttered, <HI>Cur&s;e ye</HI> Meroz, <HI>cur&s;e ye bitterly the Inhabitants thereof, becau&s;e they came not to the Help of the Lord, to the Help of the Lord again&s;t the Mighty?</HI>&mdash;Known unto God, and God alone, are all our Hearts.&mdash;Daily and repeated Experience convinceth us, that the greate&s;t Talkers are not always the greate&s;t Doers.&mdash;How therefore any of us may behave when put to the Trial, the Trial it&s;elf can only prove.&mdash;But, for my own Part, whatever my future Conduct may be, (and I know it will be downright cowardly, if left to my&s;elf) yet upon the mature&s;t Deliberation, I am at pre&s;ent &s;o fully convinced of the Ju&s;tice of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Cau&s;e, that &s;uppo&s;ing it &s;hould be &s;aid of me, as it is of <HI>Zwinglius, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Praelio</HI>&mdash;He fell in Battle;&mdash;I hope, if whil&s;t the Silver Cords of Life are loo&s;ing, I &s;hall be attended by any who may be bewailing mine, as the Friends of <HI>Zwinglius</HI> did his Misfortune, I &s;hould like him cry out, <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">quid hoc infortuni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">?</HI>&mdash;Is this a Misfortune?&mdash;And not only &s;o, but al&s;o with my expiring Breath add, as he did, <HI>O fau&s;tum infortunium!</HI> O happy Misfortune!&mdash;For, &s;urely it is far more preferable to die, tho' by a Popi&s;h Sword, and be carried from the Din and Noi&s;e of War by Angels into <HI>Abraham'</HI>s Bo&s;om, than to be &s;uffered to &s;urvive only to drag on a weari&s;ome Life, and to be a mournful Spectator, and daily Bewailer of one's Country's Ruin.</P>

Awful and tremendous are the Judgments that have lately been abroad.&mdash;Twice hath the Earth on which this great Metropolis &s;tands, unable as it were, any longer to &s;u&s;tain the Weight of its Inhabitants Sins, been made to tremble and totter under us.&mdash;Since that, how amazingly hath the Shock been extended!&mdash;<HI>Africa</HI> (nor hath <HI>America</HI> it&s;elf been exempted) hath in a mo&s;t de&s;tructive Manner felt its dire Effects.&mdash;And what a dreadful Con&s;umption it hath made in various Parts of <HI>Spain,</HI> and, in a more e&s;pecial Manner at <HI>Li&s;bon,</HI> the Metropolis of <HI>Portugal,</HI> is beyond Conception, and beyond the Power of the mo&s;t ma&s;terly Pen to de&s;cribe.&mdash;It is to be que&s;tioned, whether the like hath ever been heard of &s;ince the Deluge.&mdash;Surely nothing was wanting to figure out and realize to that di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People the Horror of the la&s;t Day, but the Sound of the Trump, and the actual Appearance of the great Judge of Quick and Dead.&mdash;But awful and tremendous as &s;uch Phaenomenas of Nature may be; yet, if we con&s;ider the Con&s;equences of Things, was even the like Judgment (which may God avert) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o befal us, it would be but a &s;mall one, in Compari&s;on of our hearing that a <HI>French</HI> Army, accompanied with a Popi&s;h Pretender, and Thou&s;ands of <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts, was &s;uffered to invade, &s;ubdue and de&s;troy the Bodies and Sub&s;tance, and, as the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences of both the&s;e, to blind, deceive, and tyrannize over the Souls and Con&s;ciences of the People belong|ing to this <HI>happy</HI> I&s;le.</P>
<P>God forbid, that I &s;hould give flattering Titles to any; for in &s;o doing, I &s;hould provoke him to take away my Soul.&mdash;But &s;urely we mu&s;t have Eyes that &s;ee not, and Ears that hear not, as well as Hearts that do not under&s;tand, if we do not know, and &s;ee, and feel, that in re&s;pect to our civil and religious Liberties, we are undoubtedly the free&s;t People under Heaven.&mdash;And I dare appeal to the mo&s;t ungrateful and malicious Malecontent, to produce any AEra in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Annals, wherein we have enjoyed &s;uch a continued Series of civil and religious Liberty, as we have been favoured with for the&s;e Twenty-eight Years la&s;t pa&s;t, under the mild and gentle Admini&s;tration of our dread and rightful Sovereign King <HI>George.</HI>&mdash;Surely he hath been a Nur&s;ing Father to People of all Denominations; and however he may be denied it, yet he may without a Complement, ju&s;tly claim from the pre&s;ent, as well as future Age, the de&s;erved Title of <HI>GEORGE</HI> THE GREAT.&mdash;But notwith&s;tanding this &s;uch is the Degeneracy of Human Nature, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be expected, that in a Nation grown wanton with Liberty like ours, there is a great Multitude of unhappy Per&s;ons, who being Men of lax Principles, loo&s;e Lives, and broken Fortunes, may, and will be &s;o abandon'd, as to break through all Re&s;traints of Gratitude, Loyalty and Religion, and, like <HI>Cataline</HI> and his wicked Confederates, be fond of joining in any Change of Government, whereby they may entertain the mo&s;t di&s;tant Pro&s;pect of bettering their Fortunes, and gratifying their Ambition, tho' it be at the Expence of their Country's Blood.&mdash;This hath been, and no doubt &s;till continues to be, the Fate of all Civil Governments in the World, and con&s;equently is no more than what we may expect, in Times of Tumult and Danger, will be acted over again in our own Land by Men of &s;uch corrupt Minds.&mdash;But how any &s;erious and judicious, much le&s;s religious and devout Per&s;on, can be &s;o &s;tupid to all Principles of Self-Intere&s;t, and &s;o dead even to all Max|ims of common Sen&s;e, as to prefer a <HI>French</HI> to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government; or a <HI>Popi&s;h Pretender,</HI> born, nur&s;ed, and bred up in all the arbitrary and de&s;tructive Principles of the Court and Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to the pre&s;ent <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> &s;ettled in the illu&s;trious Line of <HI>Hanover,</HI> mu&s;t be imputed to nothing el&s;e but an <HI>awful infatuation.</HI>&mdash;</P>
