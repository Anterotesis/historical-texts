<HEAD>THE CHEAPSIDE APPRENTICE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ATTEND, ye young men, who are about to enter into trade, for to you I write my &s;tory. I was bound appren|tice to a re&s;pectable trade&s;man in Cheap|&s;ide. My ma&s;ter, Mr. Vincent, had acquired a very fair character, whil&s;t he was making a comfortable fortune. His wife was a dre&s;&s;y, fla&s;hy woman, who li|ked vi&s;iting and jaunting more than ta|king care of her family; whil&s;t my ma&s;|ter was plodding late at night in the compting-hou&s;e, Mrs. Vincent and her daughters were either making parties abroad, or giving entertainments at home. As we kept no footman. I was allowed, when &s;hop was &s;hut, to run from one pub|lic place to another to call a coach, to bring Mrs. Vincent and her daughters home. To lounging about the perleus of a Playhou&s;e I owe my ruin. I was generally allowed to be a hand&s;ome, well-made young man; this unfortunately
<PB N="3" REF="037140_0003_100C836A449FC2F8">
drew upon me the notice of a &s;et of tho&s;e wretched women, who nightly crowd the Theatres; I &s;hould have been delighted with the notice they took of me, had not my vanity whi&s;pered me that Mi&s;s Vincent was in love with me. This &s;u&s;picion was fully confirmed to me by one Potter, an elder apprentice, but for who&s;e wicked advice, I might have lived happily, and died virtuou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The idea that Mi&s;s Vincent was in love with me, at once compleated me for the coxcomb; I now neglected my bu&s;ine&s;s, and to dre&s;s out my per&s;on be|came the only object of my thoughts; I began to commit little frauds on my ma&s;|ter, in order to obtain money to dre&s;s out; for, ever &s;ince Potter had laughed me out of my religion, every principle of moral hone&s;ty fat loo&s;ely upon me.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to &s;ay, the holy Sabbath in our family was only di&s;tingui&s;hed from other days by the &s;hutting of the &s;hop; my ma&s;ter &s;pent the greater part of it po&s;ting his books, and my mi&s;tre&s;s and her daughters were either dre&s;&s;ing to go abroad, or el&s;e to receive company at
<PB N="4" REF="037140_0004_100C93EEE19492A8">
home. We young men, indeed, were &s;ent to church, but as we had no exam|ples &s;et us by the heads of the family going thither them&s;elves, Potter and I generally hired a gig, and da&s;hed away from one tea-drinking place to another; the&s;e &s;cenes &s;oon made me lo&s;e all re&s;pect for Virtue and Religion. It was at the Dog and Duck I fir&s;t &s;aw the infamous Mi&s;s We&s;t; &s;he was many years older than my&s;elf, her per&s;on was as lovely as her heart was wicked. She was no &s;oon|er informed that I was to come into po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of 3000l. the day I came of age, than &s;he made u&s;e of all her deceitful arts to en&s;nare both my &s;oul and body, as &s;he often prompted me to defraud my ma&s;ter to &s;upply her extravagance. My attachment to Mi&s;s Vincent was now on the decline, for Mi&s;s We&s;t had &s;o far wrought upon my vanity, as to make me believe that &s;o hand&s;ome a young fellow as I was, &s;hould look higher than a trade&s;|man's daughter. From that moment I treated Mi&s;s Vincent with the mo&s;t mar|ked neglect, although I &s;aw my conduct cut her to the heart; yet, at the &s;ame time I was ba&s;e enough to borrow money
<PB N="5" REF="037140_0005_100C93F1038E6298">
of her, which I wantonly &s;quandered away on Mi&s;s We&s;t.</P>
<P>When Potter's apprentice&s;hip expired, in&s;tead of improving his fortune by throw|ing it into trade, he plunged at once into all the vices of the Town. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a plau&s;ible kind of prate, which cau&s;ed him to be appointed Chairman to our Club, which was chiefly compo&s;ed of clerks and apprentice boys. Potter's principal excellence con&s;i&s;ted in &s;inging a merry &s;ong, telling an indecent &s;tory, and teaching his hearers to laugh at mo|rality, and &s;et all religion at defiance, for religion he maintained, was only an old woman's tale, invented, by cunning heads to keep children and fools in order.</P>
<P>There was an hone&s;t old Porter lived in our family, who for &s;ome time had &s;et him&s;elf to watch my conduct, and at length he made &s;uch a faithful report of it to my ma&s;ter, that he gave up my inden|tures, and turned, me out of doors.</P>
<P>I was too much delighted with my li|berty, to feel the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of &s;hame at the means by which I obtained it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037140_0006_100C93F3AA0EBD28">
I was &s;orry, however, to break off en|tirely with Mi&s;s Vincent, for I &s;till had a lurking affection for her; I told Potter &s;o; his inventive genius &s;oon laid a plan whereby I might get her into my power, and take a compleat revenge on her whole family at the &s;ame time. This was by writing her a letter, &s;etting forth the violence of my love, the unmerited di&s;|grace I had received from her family, and at the &s;ame time reque&s;ting her to grant me a private meeting, in order that I might ju&s;tify my conduct to her, as other|wi&s;e I feared the violence of my pa&s;&s;ion would drive me to a fit of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>This poor imprudent girl met me at the time, and place appointed. I will not here &s;hock my readers with relating the vile &s;tratagems I made u&s;e of to com|pleat the ruin of this young lady, nor the tremendous oaths I &s;wore to repair her wrongs by marriage, as &s;oon as I came of age, which would be in a very few months; this &s;omewhat abated her &s;orrow for the the very indi&s;creet &s;tep &s;he had taken.</P>
<P>The day I became of age, I went down into the country. My friends having
<PB N="7" REF="037140_0007_100C93F537BE8200">
been apprized of my profligate life, re|ceived me very coldly. I practi&s;ed the deepe&s;t hypocricy on my good mother, to make her believe I was quite a reformed man, in order to wheedle her out of a &s;um of money, telling her at the &s;ame time, I had an immediate pro&s;pect of en|tering into a very profitable concern with a partner of great re&s;pon&s;ibility, if I could but increa&s;e my capital.</P>
<P>"Frank," &s;aid &s;he, with firmne&s;s, "there is no tru&s;ting to your promi&s;es; as long as your conduct de&s;erved my love, you ever found me an indulgent mother, but you &s;hall never have cau&s;e to &s;ay, I acted towards you like a weak woman, by robbing my virtuous children, to &s;up|ply the wanton extravagance of a profli|gate &s;on. Your wicked life, Frank, has nearly broken my heart, but it &s;hall not &s;hake my ju&s;tice." The well known &s;tea|dine&s;s of my mother's temper convinced me at once &s;he was not further to be impo|&s;ed upon by the fallacy of my arguments.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had &s;ettled my bu&s;ine&s;s, I returned to London to Mi&s;s Vincent, who had waited for me with the utmo&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="037140_0008_100C93F6C68DB818">
patience, fully expecting I was come to fulfil my promi&s;e of marriage to her "I can &s;truggle with want, dear Frank," &s;aid &s;he, "but I will never con&s;ent to live in &s;hame."</P>
<P>Nothing I am certain hardens the heart like vice, for although this poor young creature was brought into a very trying &s;ituation by the pro&s;pect of &s;oon becoming a mother, I &s;wore I would ne|ver make <HI>her</HI> my <HI>wife,</HI> who had di&s;gra|ced her&s;elf by living with me as a <HI>mis|tress.</HI> On hearing this, in all the tender agonies of grief, &s;he urged me to repair the wrongs I had done her, reminding me at the &s;ame time of the wicked arts I had made u&s;e of to beguile her of her in|nocence, and then, with cla&s;ped hands and &s;treaming eyes, &s;he threw her&s;elf on her knees before me, be&s;eeching me to pity the agonies which rent her &s;oul, yet my hardened nature was untouched by her &s;orrow, again I &s;olemnly &s;wore I ne|ver would marry her.</P>
<P>Through exce&s;s of grief &s;he &s;ainted away, in which pitiable &s;tate I left her to the care of a &s;ervant, went out and
<PB N="9" REF="037140_0009_100C93F90CD9FE48">
&s;pent the re&s;t of the evening with Mi&s;s We&s;t, who&s;e flinty heart turned into ri|dicule the &s;orrowful tale I related to her.</P>
<P>On returning to my lodgings the next morning, I was informed Mi&s;s Vincent had left them without leaving behind her the lea&s;t information where &s;he was to be found, and much did I rejoice when I heard it, that &s;he had taken her&s;elf off &s;o quietly.</P>
<P>I now lavi&s;hed my money as though it would never have an end. By all I was e&s;teemed the mo&s;t noble &s;pirited fellow in the world, and even little wits would be &s;ilent in my pre&s;ence, becau&s;e I was &s;ure to pay for the wine upon which they were to riot. My ca&s;h at length beginning to run low, as I had been all along drawing from the principal, I advi&s;ed with Potter how to get furni&s;hed with future &s;upplies. He advi&s;ed the gaming table as a never-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ailing friend, &s;aying it had long &s;ince been the only re&s;ource from whence he derived his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>I took his advice, and for &s;ome months was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that I began to da&s;h
<PB N="10" REF="037140_0010_100C93FAF75613A0">
away in higher life at the We&s;t end of the Town. I bought an elegant phaeton which I drove every Sunday in Hyde Park, with Mi&s;s We&s;t by my &s;ide. One day as I was driving furiou&s;ly through Temple Bar, I had the misfortune to overturn a poor man with a heavy load on his back, and on his getting up I per|ceived him to be Mr. Vincent's old por|ter, to whom I formerly owed my di&s;|grace.</P>
<P>"Ah! ah! what is it you, young hopeful?" cried he, on &s;eeing to whom he owed his misfortune, "well, he mu&s;t needs go whom the devil drives; thy prancing nags may die a natural death, ma&s;ter Frank, but verily, I think 'tis more than thou wilt, boy, for if thou die&s;t in thy &s;hoes, the gallows will be robbed of it's due. What is become of poor Patty Vincent, thou profligate dog, ha&s;t thou broken her heart, as thou ha&s;t that of her poor afflicted parents?"</P>
<P>The &s;udden recollection of that unfor|tunate girl cau&s;ed &s;uch a &s;wimming in my heed, that the reins dropt from my hands, my hor&s;es took fright, and it was almo&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="037140_0011_100C93FCE80DC4D8">
a miracle that I got home alive. The porter's words had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;i|on on my mind, that I could not &s;hake them off. Soon after Potter calling in upon me, I told him of my interview with the old porter, and al&s;o the effect it had on me. "Frank," &s;aid he, if a fel|low of thy &s;pirit can be thus ea&s;ily over|come by qualms of con&s;cience, let us in|&s;tantly adjourn to the tavern, &s;ince good wine is the be&s;t remedy in the world to drown all unea&s;y recollections in." I gladly accepted his propo&s;al, we called a coach, and off we went. He no &s;ooner &s;aw my &s;pirits inflamed with wine, than he drew me to the gaming table, where, before morning, I lo&s;t every &s;hilling I had in the world; I applied to Potter to lend me 50 guineas, as he had won more than 200 of me.</P>
<P>Laughing heartily he told me, it had ever been a maxim with him, never to lend his money to a man who had not prudence to keep his own; "but harkee, Frank," &s;aid he, "I'll give thee my be&s;t advice gratis: &s;uch a noble &s;pirited young fellow as thou art, needs never be at a lo&s;s for money, while he can &s;nap a trigger,
<PB N="12" REF="037140_0012_100C93FEC675A7F0">
and the highway is le&s;t open for him to practi&s;e upon. Men who follow the &s;ame cour&s;e of plea&s;ure, are the la&s;t people in the world to help each other in the hour of di&s;tre&s;s; virtuous men, Frank, only feel for the wants of their friends, and they alone find plea&s;ure in relieving them." He then whi&s;tled him&s;elf off.</P>
<P>When I got home, I &s;at revolving in my mind how to get my&s;elf out of my pre&s;ent difficulties, when in a fatal mo|ment, Satan whi&s;pered in my ears the word FORGERY. At fir&s;t I &s;tarted at the thought, but my poverty was clamorous, my pride &s;tartled at di&s;grace, although my con&s;cience did not &s;hudder at the crime. I knew I could copy Mr. Vin|cent's hand exactly, I &s;natched up the pen to draw a bill upon him for 500l. but a cold &s;hivering &s;eizing me, it dropt from my &s;ingers, a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of my guilt now overtook me, I tore what I had written to pieces, and exclaimed, I am a free man again; and for a moment felt thankful that I had been enabled to re&s;i&s;t the violence of temptation. I &s;at pon|dering, however, how I &s;hould maintain my&s;elf, again I was a&s;&s;aulted with the
<PB N="13" REF="037140_0013_100C94016C9D8DF8">
dread of poverty, and again I &s;natched up the pen, drew the fatal bill, and in|&s;tantly went out and got it accepted.</P>
<P>But the moment I &s;ought to take re&s;t at night on my pillow, I felt as if all the horrors of Hell had &s;eized me. I jumped out of bed in my &s;leep, and was going to throw my&s;elf out of the window, ha|ving dreamt that I was apprehended, the people of the hou&s;e, awakened by my cries, ran into the room, concluding &s;ome villains had broken in, and were going to murder me.</P>
<P>I never afterwards went into the &s;treet but my fears told me I was the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation of all the people I met. Once I happened to hear one man &s;ay to another, pointing to a third, "that's he, that's he," I took to my heels, conclu|ding that I my&s;elf was meant, and ran from one &s;treet to another, without know|ing whither, till my &s;ight failed me, and through lo&s;s of breath, I dropped down in a fit. Some humane people, however recovered me, and put me into a hack|ney coach which carried me home.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="037140_0014_100C940378E3EB48">
One day, a &s;udden gu&s;t of wind blew open my chamber door, again I concluded the officers were coming to take me. Snatching up the poker to defend my|&s;elf, I &s;wore I would not be taken alive, when turning about &s;uddenly. I caught a glimp&s;e of my&s;elf in the gla&s;s, my eyes looked wild, my lips quivered, my jaws dropped, my teeth &s;hattered, and my bo|dy &s;hook, as though the la&s;t agonies of death were upon me. On finding I was once more become the dupe of my fears, my &s;pirits rallied again, I dre&s;&s;ed and went to the play; there I met Sally We&s;t, whom I had not &s;een for &s;ome weeks; for, to &s;ay the truth, I dreaded to meet an old acquaintance from the time I committed the forgery; after the play, we went off together to &s;up at a tavern, we had not been there a quarter of an hour when &s;he made an excu&s;e for quitting the room in about ten minutes &s;he returned to me, expre&s;&s;ing in the tendere&s;t terms the &s;atis|faction &s;he had to &s;ee me again.</P>
<P>We were, as I believed, ju&s;t going to &s;it down to &s;upper, when the waiters came in followed by two of Sir John Fielding's men. Immediately, with the
<PB N="15" REF="037140_0015_100C94050B0F5C20">
greate&s;t coolne&s;s, Mi&s;s We&s;t aro&s;e, and and laying her hand on my &s;houlder ex|claimed, 'the Phili&s;tines be upon thee, Sam&s;on.' "Gentlemen," continued &s;he to the officers, "this is my good friend Mr. Francis H**** of whom you have been &s;ome time in &s;earch. Perhaps Frank, continued &s;he, "you do not know that your forgery is di&s;covered, and that 100l. reward is offered for taking you, when I left the room ju&s;t now it was to write a note to the&s;e gentlemen, &s;ignifying to them where you were to be found; I &s;ee you are terrified, but hear me for the la&s;t time perhaps, and you will le&s;s won|der at my conduct. Early in life, Frank, I was betrayed to ruin, by a ba&s;e de&s;ign|ing man; my reputation once bla&s;ted, I was de&s;erted by all the virtuous part of my own &s;ex; by having bad examples always before my eyes, I &s;oon became hardened in &s;in and abandoned to &s;hame. I have lately contracted debts; if they are not immediately di&s;charged I &s;hall be &s;ent to a jail; this jail I know not how to avoid but by &s;ending you thither in my &s;tead, as the reward offered for taking <HI>you</HI> will ju&s;t &s;et <HI>me</HI> free from my creditors."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="037140_0016_100C940787544438">
I was &s;truck motionle&s;s with terror, and fainted away on the officers approach|ing to tie my hands behind me; not had I the lea&s;t recollection of what pa&s;&s;ed, till I found my&s;elf &s;afe locked in my pri|&s;on. About a week after this, the keep|er came to tell me, there was a pri&s;oner lately brought in who was very de&s;irous of &s;eeing me, and as &s;he appeared an ob|ject of great pity, he offered to conduct me to her. On entering the chamber, I &s;aw a young woman very &s;habbily dre&s;&s;ed, lying on a mi&s;erable bed, in a very weak condition.</P>
<P>"Do&s;t thou not know me, Frank?" &s;aid &s;he in a hollow broken voice? "Ha&s;t thou lo&s;t all remembrance of Patty Vin|cent." I felt in&s;tantly as if &s;truck with a thunderbolt. "Merciful heaven?" cried I, falling on my knees by the bed|&s;ide, "I am unable to bear the puni&s;h|ment my crimes have brought upon me! O God of mercy &s;upport my troubled &s;oul." She kindly urged me to be comfort|ed, &s;aid &s;he wi&s;hed not to &s;ee me to re|proach me for the evils I had brought up|on her, but only to tell me with her la&s;t breath that &s;he forgave me. "It is not
<PB N="17" REF="037140_0017_100C9409D1D40E70">
an hour &s;ince, Frank," continued &s;he, "that I heard you were my fellow pri|&s;oner, and what is wor&s;e at my father's &s;uit. I will not reproach you, Frank, I tell you again, for all the mi&s;eries you have brought upon me, becau&s;e you are a pri&s;oner and in chains. If my breath will hold out, I will endeavour to give you a &s;hort hi&s;tory of my&s;elf &s;ince we parted. On your refu&s;ing to make me your lawful wife, I quitted your lodgings, re&s;olving by my labour to eat the bread of indu&s;try rather than follow a cour&s;e of vice for a wretched &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. I hired a garret in Holborn, where I applied for needle-work, and &s;oon obtained it. In a|bout three months after our &s;eparation, my infant came into the world, I &s;old my clothes for my &s;upport during my confinement, but that re&s;ource &s;oon failed me. My health and &s;trength declined, I was &s;eized with a con&s;tant fever and cough, and quite unable to &s;upply the &s;canty mor&s;el of bread for the day, yet re&s;olved to die ra|ther than afflict my dear parents with the knowledge of my mi&s;ery. At length being too weak to labour, I contracted &s;e|veral &s;mall debts, for which I was &s;eized and brought hither, I have however &s;ince
<PB N="18" REF="037140_0018_100C940B5D21AFF8">
been prevailed upon to &s;end my poor hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> fami&s;hed baby to my parents, ho|ping they will afford her that bread which her dying mother dared not a&s;k for her|&s;elf." Ob&s;erving I was &s;peechle&s;s with agony, poor Patty went on, "I did not wi&s;h to &s;ee you, Frank, to afflict you, I wi&s;h only to warn you with my dying breath to repent the evil of your ways, and humble your &s;oul before God. Re|pentance for &s;in, Frank, though bitter for the moment, yet I have found health|ful to the &s;oul, and however the wicked who are at ea&s;e, may deride the God who made them, yet the &s;ighing and the &s;orrowing heart will flee unto him, as the only pre&s;ent help in time of trouble; I &s;hall very &s;oon lay down my heavy bur|den of &s;ickne&s;s and &s;orrow, and e&s;cape from a dark&s;ome pri&s;on, as I humbly tru&s;t, to everla&s;ting re&s;t.&mdash;O Frank! Frank! it is far &s;afer to die a penitent in a jail, than to live in a palace, with a heart untouched with God's grace."</P>
<P>Here &s;he was interrupted by the unex|pected entrance of Mr. and Mrs. Vin|cent. O ye, who &s;hall hereafter read my &s;tory, drop a tear of pity at the agony I

now endured! They no &s;ooner beheld their child, than each by turns tenderly embraced her, a&s;&s;ured her of their forgive|ne&s;s, and gently child her, for having con|cealed her&s;elf &s;o long, adding, that as a penitent child they would mo&s;t gladly have received her, though they would have &s;hunned her, if they found her living in pro&s;perous wickedne&s;s. She thanked them, and &s;aid.</P>

<HEAD>TRUE EXAMPLES OF THE Interposition of Providence, IN THE DISCOVERY AND PUNISHMENT OF MURDER, (By that famous Magistrate, Mr. Justice, Fielding.)</HEAD>
<P>A Man was taken up on &s;u&s;picion of Murder, but when brought to the Bar, the evidence appeared not &s;trong enough to convict him. He pretended to be quite ea&s;y about the matter, and be|haved with great boldne&s;s, becau&s;e he knew there was no witne&s;s to the fact, for he had really committed the Murder, and had taken every caution to prevent a di&s;covery; making u&s;e of all that care and prudence which are always much &s;harpened by a &s;en&s;e of guilt, though they have hardly ever been known to an&s;wer the end; &s;ome one circum&s;tance being generally overlooked, by the per|mi&s;&s;ion of Divine Providence, in order
<PB N="26" REF="037140_0026_100C941C08E23B20">
to lead to a &s;ure, though perhaps di&s;tant di&s;covery. Sooner or later all &s;ins come to light.</P>
<P>When he came upon his trial, the Judge ob&s;erved in the Man's countenance an unea&s;ine&s;s, terror, and confu&s;ion, which all his pretended boldne&s;s, and pro|te&s;tations of innocence could not hide. This much increa&s;ed his &s;u&s;picion, and he therefore kept his eye &s;teadily fixed on his face during the whole time. As &s;oon as the la&s;t witne&s;s was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, the Man a&s;ked, with pretended coolne&s;s, if they had any more evidence to produce again&s;t him. The Judge fixed his eyes &s;ternly upon his face, and in a very &s;o|lemen manner a&s;ked him this que&s;tion. Friend, do you not your&s;elf know that one <HI>could</HI> appear again&s;t you, who&s;e evi|dence would put the matter out of all doubt?&mdash;At this the Man &s;tarted, look|ed extremely terrified, and eagerly cri|ed out&mdash;"My Lord, he is not a legal witne&s;s, no Man can &s;peak in his own cau&s;e, nor was the wound I gave him half &s;o large as what he &s;hews again&s;t me."</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="037140_0027_100C941D93AFEAC0">
The Judge, who had a very deep knowledge of human nature, pre&s;ently perceived by the Man's &s;tarting, and the wildne&s;s and terror of his look, that he was the real Murderer, and that in the di&s;traction of a guilty con&s;cience his ima|gination had rai&s;ed up to his mind the Gho&s;t of the Murdered man. The Judge therefore acting upon &s;uch a rea&s;on|able &s;uppo&s;ition, talked to the pri&s;oner accordingly. By his farther examination, he &s;oon brought him to confe&s;s that he had been guilty of the Murder for which he was now tried; though, as was &s;aid above he had made &s;ure of being acquit|ted, becau&s;e he knew no human witne&s;s could be brought to appear again&s;t him. But the ju&s;tice of God made his own con|&s;cience his accu&s;er. After this full con|fe&s;&s;ion of the fact, he was condemned, and hanged in chains at the very place where he declared the Murder had been committed. At his death he confe&s;&s;ed that his guilty con&s;cience was &s;o haunted with the crime, that upon his trial he ve|rily believed that the Gho&s;t of the Mur|dered Man had &s;tood before him with a wound, twice as large as that which he had given him,</P>

<P>A Gentleman in good circum&s;tances was &s;o de&s;perately wicked as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o murder his Friend, a Man in bu&s;ine&s;s near Bow-Church in Cheap&s;ide; and with &s;uch aggravated circum&s;tances of malice, revenge, and cruelty, as made it impo&s;&s;ible for him to expect any mercy, if his crime &s;hould ever be found out. He therefore made his e&s;cape into France, where he lived for &s;ome years, and began to fancy that he was quite &s;afe; but GOD's thoughts are not as our thoughts, and the voice of blood will be heard by Almighty vengeance &s;ooner or later. But from the horrors of his guilty con&s;cience, which almo&s;t every night pre&s;ented before his Eyes, whether &s;leeping or waking, his murdered Friend, he felt tenfold the puni&s;hment which by flight he had vainly hoped to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>After twenty years re&s;idence, or rather wandering abroad, through mo&s;t parts of Europe, (for his mind was
<PB N="29" REF="037140_0029_100C9421D3474D80">
not quiet enough to let him live long in the &s;ame place) he re&s;olved to re|turn back into England.&mdash;He chang|ed his name, and as time and change of climate had altered his per&s;on, he doubted not but he might in &s;ome re|tired part of the Country, wear out the remainder of his days, and perhaps re|cover that peace of mind which he had there left behind him.</P>
<P>But public Ju&s;tice though &s;low at la&s;t overtook him; for the very evening that he landed in a Wherry at Queen-Hithe Stairs, as he was walking up Cheap&s;ide in order to get into a Coach, ju&s;t in the du&s;k, and by the very door of his Murdered Friend, he heard a voice cry "&s;top him, &s;top him, there he is."&mdash;On this he ran as fa&s;t as he was able, and &s;oon found him&s;elf fol|lowed by a great Mob. He was &s;oon overtaken and &s;eized: on which he cried out with extreme terror&mdash;"I con|fe&s;s the fact; I am the Man that did it."</P>
<P>The Mob hereupon &s;aid, as he had confe&s;&s;ed the crime they would immedi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ately

proceed to execution, and after they had made him refund the &s;tolen goods, they would give him the di&s;cipline of pumping, dragging him through the ken|nel and the like. On this he &s;aid he had &s;tolen nothing, for though he had mur|dered Mr. L. yet he had no intention of robbing his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>By this unexpected an&s;wer the Mob found them&s;elves mi&s;taken; for they were pur&s;uing a pick-pocket&punc; and &s;eeing this man run hard, they concluded him to be the pick-pocket: and now they were for letting him go as a per&s;on di&s;|tracted that knew not what he &s;aid. One man however who had long lived in that neighbourhood, and heard of the Murder of Mr. L. &s;o long ago, de&s;ired the &s;trange Gentleman might be examined before a Magi&s;trate. He was according|ly carried before the Lord Mayor, who took his confe&s;&s;ion of the fact for which he was &s;oon after hanged. He declared at the Gallows that di&s;graceful as his puni&s;hment was, yet the day of his ex|ecution was the happie&s;t he had known &s;ince he committed that horrid, treach|erous,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">(Recorded by the &s;ame Author.)</HEAD>
<P>IN Leice&s;ter&s;hire not far from Lut|terworth, lived a Miller, who hav|ing a grudge again&s;t a man, had murder|ed him in his Mill, and privately bu|ried him in his Garden. Not long af|ter he had committed this horrid crime, the Miller found means to change his place of abode, and &s;ettled in another country a great way off. Here he lived a long time, believing that his villany would never be di&s;covered; but this hardened wretch did not reflect, that though no fellow-creature &s;aw him, GOD did, and that though God is pati|ent and long-&s;uffering, he &s;eldom fails to bring wicked actions to light in this world, and never fails to puni&s;h them in the next. Twenty years had now pa&s;&s;ed over his head in &s;afety, and he thought
<PB N="32" REF="037140_0032_100C9427D9FDFDE0">
he might without any danger venture to return to vi&s;it &s;ome old friends in the vil|lage where he had formerly lived. All is now &s;afe thought he, and it is impo&s;&s;i|ble the old &s;tory &s;hould be ever brought to light.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at that very time while he was on this vi&s;it in his native village, by the Providence of GOD, the Miller who had pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Mill, having occa&s;ion to dig uncommonly deep in his Garden, found the Body, or rather the Bones of the Murdered Man.&mdash;The neighbours then recollected that about twenty years ago, a man had been mi&s;|&s;ing in the Pari&s;h, and was never heard of after. Some likewi&s;e recollected who was then owner of the Mill, and that ve|ry Miller being now in the Pari&s;h, they all ran to the hou&s;e where he was, and &s;urrounding it called on him as the Mur|derer of the Per&s;on who&s;e bones had been thus providentially di&s;covered. The wretched Miller was &s;o &s;hocked and confounded with the &s;udden and ge|neral accu&s;ation; and Con&s;cience, which had &s;lept for twenty years, was now &s;o horribly &s;tung, that he &s;oon confe&s;&s;ed the
<PB N="33" REF="037140_0033_100C9429C7FF7470">
Fact, was tried, found guilty, and execu|ted according to his ju&s;t de&s;erts.</P>
<P><HI>The following observations of this wise and famous Magistrate, being un|happily, just as well suited to the present time, as the time when that great Man wrote them, I hope they may he useful to my Readers.</HI></P>
<P>That the mo&s;t dreadful crime of Murder, hath of late years increa&s;ed in a very deplorable degree in this Kingdom, is a fact which every Man mu&s;t confe&s;s, and which every good Man mu&s;t very bitterly lament. Till this age indeed, cruel and bloody ac|tions were &s;o &s;eldom heard of in Eng|land, that when they happened, they appeared as prodigies, and rai&s;ed not only the a&s;toni&s;hment, but the ab|horrence of the People&mdash;Murder is but very lately began to be common among us.</P>
<P>For my part I &s;incerely declare I can di&s;cover no more than one cau&s;e of the horrid evil of which I am com|plaining&mdash;ONE indeed perfectly capa|ble
<PB N="34" REF="037140_0034_100C942B53A57AE0">
of producing every mi&s;chief, and which has more than all other cau&s;es contributed to produce, and to in|crea&s;e all the evils with which the public is at pre&s;ent &s;o extremely af|flicted.</P>
<P>My &s;en&s;ible Reader will pre&s;ently gue&s;s what I mean.&mdash;I mean that ge|neral NEGLECT. I fear I may &s;ay CON|TEMPT OF RELIGION, which hath with|in the&s;e few years, &s;o fatally over&s;pread this whole Kingdom, till it has reached the very lowe&s;t ranks of Men:&mdash;It cannot be otherwi&s;e, for when we think of the &s;olemn threatenings of ALMIGH|TY GOD again&s;t the crime of Murder, how is it po&s;&s;ible to think that a crea|ture who believes that there is a GOD &s;hould, unle&s;s he be a Fool, or a Madman, thus audaciou&s;ly fly in the face of that AWFUL BEING, in who&s;e words we mu&s;t be a&s;&s;ured is all truth, and in who&s;e right hand is all power.</P>
