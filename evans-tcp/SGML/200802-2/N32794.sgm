<HEAD>A TESTIMONY CONCERNING MY DEAR FRIEND AND COUSIN MARY MOLLINEUX, DECEASED, In a living Remembrance of the Benefit which I re|ceived by her Labour of Love; and now recommend to the Youth of our Age, to excite them to Faithful|ne&s;s, and a circum&s;pect Conver&s;ation.</HEAD>
<P>THE worthy Author of the&s;e Writings, was one who&s;e near Relation to me began our Acquaintance almo&s;t with our Lives; &s;he was the only Child of her Mother, as I of my Father, and they one Brother and Si&s;ter. This gave us Op|portunity of frequent Conver&s;e with each other; and having no Si&s;ters of our own, and our natural Inclinations and Tempers being &s;uitable, cau&s;ed us more to re&s;pect each other: Tho' &s;he was of more Years, and different Principles, in Matters of Religion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Being one called Quaker.</NOTE>, at that Time, yet the Sympathy and Kindne&s;s that was betwixt us, out-balanced the &s;eeming Di&s;parity; and we could argue without Wrangling, and di&s;&s;ent without Di&s;cord; and &s;uch
<PB REF="043092_0003_101CC8DCC80884C0">
was her prudent winning Carriage towards me, that even in my green and childi&s;h Years, &s;he often pre|vail'd with me to quit many trifling Things, in which I then delighted, for more profitable Employments; which &s;he was not wanting to recommend to me, nor to tell me of my Faults; but with &s;o much Af|fection and good Coun&s;el, that like a mollifying, healing Bal&s;am, it cured almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly. And &s;o far was I from accounting her my Enemy, for telling me the Truth, that con&s;idering her Wi&s;|dom and Virtue, together with her plain Dealing, which I took as no &s;mall Argument of her Kind|ne&s;s; knowing, Reproof and good Advice to be &s;o thankle&s;s an Office, that nothing but Love and Duty can prevail with a di&s;creet Per&s;on to act that Part: I &s;ay, upon the&s;e Inducements I made Choice of her as my particular Bo&s;om Friend. Nor was I mi&s;taken or di&s;appointed, for &s;uch &s;he approved her&s;elf; making Choice of me al&s;o as hers, &s;oon after my Convincement. Thus was our Love reci|procal: And this was the Beginning of our Friend|&s;hip, &s;o often mentioned in her Ver&s;es; which the rather induceth me to hint it here, as an Encou|ragement to all who profe&s;s the pure unerring Truth, to keep faithful in their Place and Te&s;timo|ny, that &s;o the Lord may make U&s;e of them to in|vite and win their Familiars and Relations to love and embrace the precious Truth, as &s;he was made an happy In&s;trument of Good to me, by her many kind Admonitions, and &s;ea&s;onable Cautions, verbal and literal, both in Ver&s;e and Pro&s;e: But chiefly, that prevailing Argument of good Example, and circum&s;pect Conver&s;ation, which the Lord, in his infinite Mercy, was plea&s;ed &s;o to ble&s;s, that they became Motives to me, to con&s;ider how much I was &s;hort of her; and to examine her Principles, as well as my own: Then did the Lord open my Eyes, and by his Light and Spirit in my Heart, gave me
<PB REF="043092_0004_101CC8DE66505598">
a Sight of my inward State and Condition; which I found to be un&s;afe, notwith&s;tanding the Advan|tages of a &s;ober Education; and that, if my Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s exceeded not that of the Scribes and Pha|ri&s;ees, in vain was it to expect an Admittance into the heavenly Kingdom. So that after much Sor|row and many Conflicts, the Lord brought me to this Re&s;olution in my own Mind, That if he would be plea&s;ed to di&s;cover his Way, which leads to Life and Salvation, and how I &s;hould attain Power to walk in it, &s;o that I might enjoy his Peace, which I &s;o much wanted, with his A&s;&s;i&s;tance I would be|come his Di&s;ciple, and follow him whither&s;oever he &s;hould lead: Then did the Lord, in his great Love, and never to be forgotten Conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;hew me, that it was a &s;traight Way, de&s;pi&s;ed by many wi&s;e and prudent of the World; and walked in by a poor, &s;elf-denying, under-valued People, which it would be hard for me to be numbered with: And &s;o I found it, being almo&s;t ready to de&s;pair, until the Lord inclined my Heart to take her Coun&s;el, and go to &s;ome Meetings of the People called <HI>Quak|ers;</HI> where I heard the Way of God &s;o plainly di&s;|covered, and his ble&s;&s;ed Truth &s;o livingly preached, that I was convinced thereof, and well &s;atisfied that the glorious Pre&s;ence of the Lord, and his Heart-mollifying Power, was with this People; which unu&s;ually tender'd my Spirit, and di&s;tingui&s;hed their Meetings from tho&s;e I had formerly frequented. This made me delight to meet with them, though much wonder'd at, &s;coff'd and reproach'd for it; yet by her encouraged: But, prai&s;ed be the great Almighty God, he brought me in his own appoint|ed Time, to witne&s;s the Fulfilling of his ancient Prophecy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;alm cx. 3.</NOTE> making me <HI>willing in the Day of his Power;</HI> willing to become a Fool and Gazing-&s;tock to my former Acquaint|ance; willing to be rid of the Load of Sin I had
<PB REF="043092_0005_101CC8E1226EC220">
laboured under: And con&s;idering that no Burden could be heavier, was al&s;o made to accept the ten|der Invitation of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour, who &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat xi. 8. 29, 30.</NOTE> <HI>Come unto me, all you who la|bour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you Re&s;t; take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Heart, and ye &s;hall find Re&s;t to your Souls; for my Yoke is ea&s;y, and my Burden is light:</HI> And ble&s;&s;ed be the eternal Goodne&s;s, I have witne&s;&s;ed it to be &s;o, in compari&s;on of the Bondage of Corrup|tion.

they faint not, but hold out to the End;</HI> as did the Author of the en&s;uing Ver&s;es; of whom I am wil|ling to give the Reader &s;ome Account.</P>
<P>She was one who, in her Childhood, was much afflicted with weak Eyes, which made her unfit for the u&s;ual Employment of Girls; and being of a large natural Capacity, quick, witty, and &s;tudiou&s;|ly inclined, her Father brought her up to more Learning, than is commonly be&s;towed on our Sex; in which &s;he became &s;o good a Proficient, that &s;he well under&s;tood the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, fluently di&s;|cour&s;ed in it; and made a con&s;iderable Progre&s;s in <HI>Greek</HI> al&s;o; wrote &s;everal Hands well; was a good Arithmetician, yea, in the be&s;t Arithmetick; <HI>for &s;he &s;o numbered her Days, as to apply her Heart unto Wi&s;dom;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;alm xc. 12.</NOTE> as al&s;o to the Study of &s;everal u&s;eful Arts; had a good Under|&s;tanding of Phy&s;ick and Surgery, the nature of Plants, Herbs, and Minerals; and made &s;ome In|&s;pection into divers profitable Sciences; delighting in the Study of Nature, and to admire the great God of Nature, in the various Operations of his Power and Goodne&s;s; the wonderful Harmony and Order of the Creation, and the infinite Wi&s;dom by which it is govern'd; of which &s;he would often &s;peak: Admiring how there could be an <HI>Athei&s;t</HI> in the World, &s;ince the Creation doth &s;o plainly a&s;&s;ert the Being of a Deity. And as we have been walk|ing or riding together, would often di&s;cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent Objects, much tending to Edification; making many pretty Remarks, and comparing out|ward Things with inward: As al&s;o, upon all Oc|ca&s;ions, would draw &s;uch u&s;eful Ob&s;ervations, as made her Company profitable and delighting: For &s;he was of a thoughtful, compo&s;ed Temper; yet of a quick Apprehen&s;ion, and ingenious; which, be|ing &s;ea&s;on'd with Truth, in which &s;he had many &s;weet Openings, the&s;e meeting in a Temper con|ver&s;able,
<PB REF="043092_0007_101CC8E55C282140">
and concerned for the Good of others, made her Conver&s;ation improving and de&s;irable. She was one who loved the ble&s;&s;ed Truth, and they who walked according to it, from a Child, being early convinced thereof; tho' &s;he was not &s;atisfied with a bare Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, but zealous for the Life of it, both in her&s;elf and others; al&s;o fur|ni&s;hed with good Arguments to defend it, being ready to give an An&s;wer to every one that a&s;ked a <HI>Rea&s;on of the Hope which was in her,</HI> with Meekne&s;s and Fear: Nor forward to begin a Di&s;pute, yet &s;ound in what &s;he undertook, and never, that I know of, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oil'd in an Argument; for &s;he had an Eye to the Lord, and liked to be &s;atisfied that &s;he was in her Place, and called by him to what &s;he did for him: Would often mention the Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Uzzah,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> vi. 6, 7. how Death was his Pu|ni&s;hment, for putting forth his Hand to take hold of the Ark of God, when the Oxen &s;hook it; it being a Service not required of him.</P>
<P>Nor was &s;he proud, or conceited of her Parts and Learning, but adorned with an humble Mode&s;ty; having, I believe, meaner Thoughts of her&s;elf, than any one el&s;e had of her, who knew her Qualifi|cations.</P>
<P>Plain and decent in her Cloaths, which &s;he va|lued for Service more than Sight; and &s;lighted, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e better Ornaments of the Mind, which &s;he prefer'd above &s;plendid or co&s;tly Apparel.</P>
<P>She was one that loved to read the Holy Scrip|tures, and &s;uch u&s;eful Authors as had a Tendency to Improvement; in which &s;he &s;pent much Time: God having furni&s;hed her with an extraordinary Memory to retain the &s;ame.</P>
<P>She delighted much in Solitude, and was often alone; &s;etting apart &s;ome Time of the Day for Re|tirement; and would frequently &s;ay to me, in the Evenings, Let us go a&s;ide, and wait upon the
<PB REF="043092_0008_101CC8E724C24740">
Lord; we have daily Need of daily Bread, and to renew our Strength; and how can we expect it, if we do not wait for it? And would recite the Pa&s;|&s;age of <HI>Elijah, 1 Kings</HI> xviii. 36. that at the Time of the Evening Sacrifice, the Lord an&s;wered by Fire; with other pretty Remarks, too tedious to in&s;ert, which &s;he abounded in, upon all Occa&s;ions, to promote that which was good: In the&s;e Times of Retirement, Ver&s;es would often come up in her Mind, which &s;he afterwards wrote: Many of the&s;e, herewith printed, being Meditations according to the Frame and Exerci&s;e of her Spirit, when thus compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Neither did &s;he neglect publick Opportunities to wor&s;hip God; for &s;he was diligent in frequenting religious Meetings, not being apt to omit any, unle&s;s upon an extraordinary Occa&s;ion. Nor did &s;he &s;uffer her Eyes to wander, which the Mind too often accompanies; but the Compo&s;edne&s;s of her Countenance, &s;hewed the Sedatene&s;s of her well exerci&s;ed Mind: And the good Improvement &s;he made of publick and private Devotion, her in|nocent and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Life did clearly di&s;cover; which &s;he well began in her early Years, and ma|nife&s;ted her Progre&s;s therein, by her Con&s;tancy and Per&s;everance to the End, which crowns all; <HI>for 'tis he that endures to the End, that &s;hall be &s;aved:</HI> This &s;he had a Regard to, more than the fading Enjoy|ments of this uncertain World; and, I believe, &s;he was in a good Condition when &s;he left it, and laid down her Head in Peace with the Lord, leav|ing a good Savour behind her.</P>
<P>She was one who willingly and chearfully &s;uffer|ed for the Truth, encouraging others to do the like, both by Precept and Example: One ju&s;t, hone&s;t, and true to her Word, temperate and &s;elf-denying; keeping within the Limits pre&s;cribed for Health, which &s;he regarded, more than to gratify a
<PB REF="043092_0009_101CC8EC91047DB8">
luxurious Appetite: Solid and grave in her Car|riage, mixt with an innocent Chearfulne&s;s; not formally au&s;tere; yet rather re&s;erv'd, than over-free; ba&s;hful, than bold.</P>
<P>To conclude, &s;he was one who&s;e Mode&s;ty, Charity, Friend&s;hip, and religious Conver&s;ation, came not &s;hort of her excellent Writings; to which I refer the Reader, for a fuller Character of their Author than I am capable of giving: Her own Pen having di&s;covered the rich Trea&s;ure of her pious Mind. But what I have written, is from an ex|perimental Knowledge of her; and no one, I be|lieve, knew her better than my&s;elf: For &s;he was as much without Re&s;erve to me, I think, as one Friend could be to another; for we loved entirely, communicated our Minds and Exerci&s;es to each other freely, advi&s;ing with one another on mo&s;t Occa&s;ions: And great was our Nearne&s;s and Unity of Spirit, in the Truth; yea, great was her Con|cern of my Welfare, which &s;he zealou&s;ly laboured for; as the many Letters, both in Ver&s;e and Pro&s;e, to me writ, and herewith printed, largely demon|&s;trate.</P>
<P>And tho' Ver&s;e is not &s;o commonly u&s;ed in divine Subjects as Pro&s;e, and but too much abu&s;ed by the extravagant Wits of the Age; yet &s;he, like a &s;kil|ful Chymi&s;t, had learned to &s;eparate the purer Spirits, and more refined Parts of Poetry, from the earthly, worthle&s;s Dro&s;s; and made U&s;e of her Gift, rather to convince and prevail upon the Mind, to affect and rai&s;e the Soul upon the Wings of di|vine Contemplation, than to plea&s;e the airy Fancy with Strains of Wit, and unprofitable Invention; which &s;he was ever careful to avoid.</P>
<P>And tho' living Te&s;timonies to the Truth are numerous, yet few extant in Ver&s;e, which hath an harmonious delightful Faculty in it, that influences the Minds of &s;ome more than Pro&s;e, e&s;pecially
<PB REF="043092_0010_101CC8EF34A416E8">
young People, and is more apt to imprint it&s;elf in the Memory: Therefore her Subject being divine, and &s;o &s;en&s;ibly and &s;olidly managed; as it hath been of Service to tho&s;e few who have had the Peru&s;al of it, &s;o, I hope, will be attended with a general Be|nefit.</P>
<P>And having reaped no &s;mall Advantage thereby my&s;elf, could do no le&s;s, than recommend her wor|thy Labours, and exemplary Life, to others, as a Pattern well worth following. For her Acquaint|ance may &s;ay of her, as was &s;aid of <HI>Ruth, The City of my People doth know that &s;he was a virtuous Woman.</HI> And being a good In&s;trument in the Hand of the Lord to me, having al&s;o been much comforted, en|couraged, and refre&s;hed by her Ver&s;es, my De&s;ire is, that the Lord may &s;o ble&s;s them to Po&s;terity, that they may reap &s;uch an Advantage by them, as may tend to the Promotion of Truth, and the Good of Souls in general.</P>

<HEAD>A TESTIMONY CONCERNING MY DEAR FRIEND MARY MOLLINEUX.</HEAD>
<P>AS concerning my dearly beloved Friend, <HI>Many Mollineux,</HI> I have more to te&s;tify than I &s;hall commit to Writing, having had intimate Ac|quaintance and Fellow&s;hip with her above &s;ixteen Years; in all which Time, her grave, virtuous, mode&s;t Life and Conver&s;ation, de&s;erveth &s;ingular Remembrance; becau&s;e her friendly Communica|tion, Conference, and Deportment, was always &s;olid, &s;en&s;ible, and tender, mixt with a feeling and &s;ympathizing Love to her Friends, in all Exerci&s;es and Afflictions: She was one, to whom I could freely impart my Mind and Concerns, in any Ex|erci&s;es; as I have often done, to my Comfort and Refre&s;hment. My Heart is moved, in the Remem|brance of her Faithfulne&s;s and Integrity, from the Day that I was fir&s;t acquainted with her, with Sor|row for the Lo&s;s of &s;o near a Friend; who, although &s;he was plentifully endued with many worthy Gifts and Parts, both natural and &s;piritual, yet I never knew her lifted up in any of them, nor exalted a|bove her Mea&s;ure; but rather re&s;erved, than in any wi&s;e forwardly divulging her Gifts to the pub|lick Cen&s;ure, without weighty Con&s;ideration; &s;o that &s;he would not ca&s;t her Pearls before Swine: Yet not &s;o much re&s;erved, but that to her near in|timate

I remember, that &s;everal Years ago, when &s;he was a &s;ingle Woman, upon the Peru&s;al of &s;ome Copies of her Ver&s;es which &s;he gave me, I felt &s;uch Unity of Spirit with them, that I &s;aid, I thought they might be of Service, if made publick in print; but &s;he was not then free that her Name &s;hould be ex|po&s;ed; &s;he not &s;eeking Prai&s;e among&s;t Men, but to communicate the Exerci&s;e of peculiar Gifts among&s;t her near Friends and Acquaintance; but now, &s;ince it hath plea&s;ed the Lord to remove her out of the earthly Tabernacle, into everla&s;ting Re&s;t, in which I am well &s;atisfied &s;he is forever ble&s;&s;ed, I think it would be very ungrateful to her Memory, and al&s;o a wronging of others, to keep &s;uch worthy Things unpubli&s;hed; with which, I believe, the mo&s;t that are of open Under&s;tandings, and unprejudiced Hearts, will have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, Unity.

<HEAD>A TESTIMONY CONCERNING MY LATE WIFE MARY MOLLINEUX, DECEASED.</HEAD>
<P>CONCERNING my dear, loving, and late decea&s;ed Wife, <HI>Mary Mollineux,</HI> formerly <HI>Mary Southworth,</HI> whom I took in Marriage on the 10th Day of the Second Month, 1685. I was fir&s;t acquainted with her at <HI>Lanca&s;ter-Ca&s;tle,</HI> where we both at one Time were Pri&s;oners, for being at a peaceable religious Meeting of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> in the Year 1684, tho' we had &s;een each other before. In which Impri&s;onment, I believed that &s;he &s;hould be my Wife; but never intended to expre&s;s any Thing thereof, whil&s;t we were both Pri&s;oners there; and after &s;he was relea&s;ed, I &s;aw her, and was in Company with her &s;everal Times, before I expre&s;&s;ed any Thing of my Concern to take her to be my Wife; &s;everal con&s;iderable Men having before attempted to prevail with her on that Account: And during the whole Time of my Ac|quaintance with her, which was above eleven Years, her Life and Conver&s;ation was &s;erious, in|nocent, &s;weet and &s;avoury; and &s;he was very lov|ing, diligent, tender-hearted, and kindly affection|ate towards me, and our Children; and generally
<PB REF="043092_0014_101CC8FA44C340E8">
loving and tender towards all People, e&s;pecially &s;uch as were in any Di&s;tre&s;s, Sickne&s;s, or Affliction, tho' never &s;o poor; and the Lord ble&s;&s;ed her En|deavours, as well in Advice, as Admini&s;tration of Remedies, to &s;everal; &s;o that they have acknow|ledged their Recoveries to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thereby, thro' his Ble&s;&s;ing: And what &s;he did therein, was free. She was very careful, that nothing of Evil might get a Place in her Children, or in any with whom &s;he was concerned: And therefore good Advice and Admonition &s;he frequently gave, which many re|ceived in Love and good E&s;teem of her. The Lord opened her Under&s;tanding, and enlarged her Capacity, in a great Degree, upon &s;everal Accounts; yet her Mind was not lifted up thereby, &s;o as to glory in her Gifts or Parts; but learning of Chri&s;t, the Truth, to be <HI>lowly in Heart,</HI> &s;he cho&s;e rather to appear little to Men. She was very con&s;tant and cordial to her Friends, and true in concealing of Secrets. She was often concerned to make Peace among&s;t them that were at Difference, and often prevailed therein. She was plain and free in &s;peak|ing to the Faces of any, but abhorred to reproach any in &s;ecret. Her Heart was inclined towards God, therefore &s;he was ju&s;t in her Dealing, with all people with whom &s;he had to do. She was con|vinced of the Way of Truth in her Youth, by the Light or inward Appearance of Chri&s;t in her Heart, which &s;he loved; and therefore, &s;he retaining her Integrity to the End of her Time, a Crown of end|le&s;s Life and Glory, I believe, the Lord hath be|&s;towed upon her. She was very noble in &s;uffering Per&s;ecution for the Te&s;timony of Truth, and en|during hard Exerci&s;es, occa&s;ioned by my &s;everal Impri&s;onments for the &s;ame Cau&s;e, whil&s;t &s;he was my Wife. And through &s;everal Sickne&s;&s;es and Afflictions the Lord &s;upported her, to per&s;evere in Patience, Faithfulne&s;s and Con&s;tancy to him. She
<PB REF="043092_0015_101CC8FBE0A909C8">
was very punctual in Performance of her Under|takings, and quick, di&s;creet, and diligent in her Bu&s;ine&s;s; yet &s;till &s;he u&s;ed to take a Time for pri|vate Retirement in Evenings alone, except I was with her, to wait upon, and feel after the Lord, in the Gift of his Light; Love and Grace in her Heart; and to &s;ee that, with the wi&s;e Virgins, &s;he had Oil in her burning Lamp, that it might not go out; but that &s;he might be ready to enter into the Marriage Chamber, when&s;oever the Lord, the Bridegroom of her Soul, came. She was al&s;o very diligent, in attending the A&s;&s;emblies of the People of God called <HI>Quakers,</HI> with them to meet in the Name, Power, Light and Spirit of the Lord, to wait upon him, to be opened by him, and to re|ceive Refre&s;hment, Strength and Comfort from him, and to feel the Renewings of his Love and Goodne&s;s in her Soul. And that Day Week next before her la&s;t Illne&s;s &s;eized her, after a more than u&s;ual manner, &s;he &s;aid to me, <HI>That the feeling and enjoying of the &s;weet eternal Love of God in her Heart, was more precious to her, than all other Things that could be enjoyed, &amp;c.</HI> She was concerned in her Spirit, that many, with her, and all that are faith|ful to God, might come to <HI>ta&s;te and &s;ee how good the Lord is;</HI> and upon that Account, her Words, Writings and Conver&s;ation, were acceptable, pre|valent, and &s;erviceable to the Invitation, Convince|ment, Strengthning and Encouragement of &s;ome to &s;eek after the Lord, and his ble&s;&s;ed Way and Truth, inwardly revealed, and to be revealed; wherein many have found great Satisfaction and Cau&s;e of Rejoicing.

<P>And now I &s;hall give a brief Account of what I was and am a Witne&s;s of, concerning her la&s;t Illne&s;s; and &s;ome of the &s;weet, &s;en&s;ible and precious Words which &s;he &s;pake in the Time thereof, being very &s;en&s;ible to the End; &s;o that &s;he &s;pake no imperti|nent or un&s;en&s;ible Word therein, that I know of, who con&s;tantly attended her.</P>
<P>Upon the 8th Day of the Tenth Month, 1695, &s;he was &s;eized with violent Pain and Sickne&s;s, which continued, &s;ometimes more, and &s;ometimes le&s;s: And one Morning, &s;oon after, &s;he &s;aid to me thus; <HI>I have had &s;uch a Dream, as I have &s;eldom had; it is an Emblem of my Life.</HI> And then &s;he told it me thus; <HI>viz. She dreamed, that &s;he was going at the Side of a plea&s;ant broad River, and &s;ometimes &s;he came to Breaches; which Brooks, running into the River, or the like, had made upon the Shore of it; which Breaches &s;he pa&s;&s;ed over, but &s;ometimes with Difficulty, and then ran fa&s;t on &s;till, till &s;he came to another Breach, and having pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal Breaches, &s;ome greater, and &s;ome le&s;&s;er, at la&s;t, &s;he came to a Breach which was greater than any of the re&s;t, and &s;he &s;aid within her&s;elf, how &s;hall I get over this Breach? But yet &s;he went on, and pa&s;&s;ed through it, and it was fair on the other Side; and &s;he awaked.</HI> Now, as &s;he looked upon this Dream to be an Em|blem of her Life, &s;o I cannot, nor could not, &s;ince &s;he told it me, expound it otherwi&s;e than thus, <HI>viz.</HI> That the plea&s;ant broad River, &s;ignified the Lord her Creator, who is to his People <HI>a Place of broad Rivers,</HI> I&s;a. xxxiii. 21. and the Shore thereof, upon which &s;he walked, &s;ignified Time; and the Brea|ches, which &s;he pa&s;&s;ed over, were the Difficulties and Afflictions which &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through in her Time, and the la&s;t and greate&s;t Breach which &s;he came to, and pa&s;&s;ed over, &s;ignified her la&s;t Sick|ne&s;s

and Death. From which Dream, as a &s;igni|ficant Parable, all may learn and con&s;ider, how fa&s;t they are ha&s;tning, or running, towards their la&s;t and greate&s;t Breach; even the Death, or Di&s;&s;oluti|on of their earthly Tabernacles; and none know|eth how near they are to it. About nine Days af|ter her &s;aid Illne&s;s began, &s;he &s;aid to me thus, <HI>viz. I am well content, if the Lord &s;ee meet, that he take me away by this Di&s;temper, rather than to be in this Pain; for my Pain is great, and I know not what in this World I can de&s;ire to &s;tay to enjoy, except it be my Love, and my little Lads;</HI> meaning me, and our two Children: Of whom &s;he then &s;aid thus: <HI>I would rather have my Children enriched with the Fear of the Lord, than with all manner of worldly Riches.</HI> About the &s;ame Time &s;he &s;aid, <HI>I am thinking of ho|ne&s;t</HI> Richard John&s;on, who was a near Friend to us, <HI>that &s;lept much of the Time of his Illne&s;s before his Departure; methinks it &s;eemeth like an ea&s;y Pa&s;&s;age.</HI> And &s;oon after that, &s;he began to be inclin'd to Sleepine&s;s, and &s;lept more and more till the End; yet, at her awaking, was &s;till &s;ensible and chear|ful: And tho' &s;he was daily weaker and weaker, yet &s;he would &s;till &s;it up five or &s;ix, or more, Hours in the Evenings, and di&s;cour&s;e freely and chearful|ly, till within five Days of her Departure. I often de&s;ired her to accept of the Advice of &s;ome Phy&s;i|cian, but &s;he was &s;till aver&s;e thereto in this Illne&s;s, tho' in other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he had complied. On the 20th Day of her Illne&s;s; in the Evening, di&s;cour&s;ing very freely, as formerly, &s;he told me, <HI>She was well &s;atis|fied, that if the Lord took her away by that Di&s;temper, &s;he &s;hould be eternally happy;</HI> with many other &s;en&s;i|ble and comfortable Expre&s;&s;ions: Tho' &s;he was &s;o weak, that the &s;ame Evening, about the eleventh Hour, I thought &s;he had been departing; but in a little Time, recovering her Breath, &s;he &s;poke chearfully, and &s;lept, At her awaking, that Night,

I a&s;ked her, How &s;he was? She an&s;wered, <HI>Through Mercy, indifferent.</HI> And after a little Pau&s;e, &s;he very &s;en&s;ibly &s;aid, <HI>Amictum iri, vel Ami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iendum e&s;&s;e;</HI> which is in <HI>Engli&s;h, To be cloathed hereafter,</HI> in two Expre&s;&s;ions of it: Whereby I under&s;tood, that &s;he was minding how the Lord would cloath her here|after, when her mortal Cloathing was put off. Then I de&s;ired her, in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Words, for they that were pre&s;ent, under&s;tood not <HI>Latin,</HI> that if &s;he had any Thing in her Mind, either concerning her Children, or any other Thing, farther to com|municate to me, that &s;he would do it; but &s;he, as if all outward Things were then out of her Thoughts, quickly replied in <HI>Latin,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>Why &s;peake&s;t thou &s;uch Things?

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Given forth and atte&s;ted by my Kin&s;man Henry Mol|lineux, who was there pre&s;ent, viz.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the 18th Day of the twelfth Month, 1690, I and another Neighbour were taken Pri&s;oners, and brought to <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> Jail, upon a Writ <HI>De Excommunicato Capiendo,</HI> for not appearing at the Bi&s;hop's Court in <HI>Che&s;ter;</HI> though willing to appear, but had no Citation &s;hewed us, nor lawful Notice given: Of which Proceedings, it being witne&s;&s;ed under the Hands of &s;everal who were pre&s;ent when &s;uch Notice was pretended to be given, &s;he acquainted the &s;aid Bi&s;hop, he being at <HI>Orm&s;kirk,</HI> near our Dwelling, in the &s;ixth Month, 1691, and it was &s;o evidently manife&s;ted to him, that he &s;eemed &s;atisfied of the Truth thereof, and &s;aid, <HI>They who &s;hould have given the Notice, were to be blamed, &amp;c.</HI> And moderately di&s;cour&s;ing with her, he &s;aid, <HI>If &s;he would come to his Dwelling-hou&s;e in</HI> Wigan, <HI>within two or three Weeks, when he had conferred with his Chancellor, if he could find out any Way to do it, he would do any Kindne&s;s therein that lay in his Power for her.</HI> Now that which &s;he de|&s;ired, was that the Pri&s;oners might be admitted in his Court to put in their Appearance; for want of which they were impri&s;oned. So, upon his Ad|vice, on the 24th Day of the &s;ixth Month 1691, &s;he went to the Bishop's Hou&s;e in <HI>Wigan,</HI> to receive
<PB REF="043092_0025_101CC918500618B8">
his An&s;wer; where he again di&s;cour&s;ed with her, and &s;eemed willing that the Pri&s;oners might be ad|mitted to put in their Appearance; but his Chan|cellor's Deputy there concluded, that they could not be &s;o admitted. Then the Bi&s;hop a&s;ked her, <HI>Why they could not pay the Church-leys,</HI> for that was the Cau&s;e for which we were pro&s;ecuted; &s;he an|&s;wered, <HI>They could not pay them for Con&s;cience-&s;ake:</HI> He required her to &s;hew him &s;ome Scripture for it; then &s;he a&s;ked him to &s;hew her any Precept or Ex|ample in the Scriptures, that the <HI>Jews,</HI> or any of the People of God, ever offered to compel any other People to pay towards the upholding of their Wor&s;hip, or Wor&s;hip-hou&s;es, or Temples? The Bi&s;hop replied, <HI>Tho' he could not do that, yet what Scripture have you for it,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that you cannot pay to ours for Con&s;cience-&s;ake?</HI> She an&s;wering, &s;aid, I will offer thee Scripture for it, and it is this: It is &s;aid in the Scriptures, <HI>Come out from among them, (my People) and be ye &s;eparate, &s;aith the Lord, touch not the unclean Thing, and I will receive you,</HI> 2 Cor. vi. 17, 18. Rev. xviii. 4. Now, &s;aid &s;he, if we had believed that you, in your Wor&s;hip, had been right, we had not come out from among&s;t you; but becau&s;e we believed, and were convinced, that it was not right, and therefore are come out from among&s;t you, we dare not for Con&s;cience-&s;ake touch with you; but if we &s;hould pay towards your Wor&s;hip, or Wor&s;hip-hou&s;es, we &s;hould both touch and uphold. To which An&s;wer, the Bi&s;hop made no Reply; but he &s;aid to his Chancellor's Deputy, <HI>I pray you, Mr.</HI> Pre&s;cot, <HI>if you can find out any way, that they may put in their Appearance, that they may have their Liberty, let it be done; and do what Kindne&s;s you can for them:</HI> And &s;o he went his way. The Bi&s;hop could give no Scripture, in An|&s;wer to her Que&s;tion; but &s;he an&s;wered his Que&s;|tion with Scripture, &s;o that he made no Reply:
<PB REF="043092_0026_101CC91D6FC0EA20">
And &s;he, to his Face, bore a faithful Te&s;timony again&s;t their Wor&s;hip, which is pre&s;cribed by Men; which Te&s;timony the Bi&s;hop did not contradict. And there being then pre&s;ent, one <HI>Entwi&s;tle,</HI> the Bi&s;hop's Chaplain, &s;o called, and his Brother <HI>En|twi&s;tle,</HI> a Lawyer, and another Prie&s;t, and the Bi|&s;hop's Daughter; when the Bi&s;hop was gone, and &s;he and her Kin&s;man were come out of the Hou&s;e, and were going away, they all four followed; and the &s;aid Chaplain, or Prie&s;t <HI>Entwi&s;tle,</HI> began, and engaged with her in a Di&s;pute concerning Religi|on; and in about half an Hour, or le&s;s, he was &s;o taken and confounded in his own Arguments, that his Mouth was &s;topped; which his Brother, the Lawyer &s;eeing, as it were to excu&s;e him, &s;aid to him, <HI>I wonder you &s;hould trouble your&s;elf to di&s;cour&s;e with that Woman, &s;he hath &s;o much Learning, it makes her mad.</HI> To which &s;he &s;aid, What! do you (Letter-learned) now begin to vilify Learning, by which you have your Honours and Preferments? Then the Lawyer, not &s;peaking any other Word, went away, and &s;he left them.</P>

<P>So the Bi&s;hop, and his Chaplain, and the Chap|lain's Brother, a Lawyer, were all put to Silence by the Wi&s;dom wherewith the Lord endued her, to &s;peak in Defence of the Cau&s;e of his Truth: Prai&s;es be to God for ever.</P>
<P>After this, we being out of Pri&s;on, and under|&s;tanding that the Pari&s;h-Prie&s;t was endeavouring to get us into it again, (and &s;o we were again impri|&s;oned) &s;he &s;poke the&s;e Words, which I then wrote, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q><PB REF="043092_0027_101CC9219BF26758">
<L><HI>E&s;uriens agnis quantum concedet in agris</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ip&s;e lupus, vobis jam dabid i&s;te mi&s;er;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Crudeli&s;que rapax, cupidus, &s;ine jure, Sacerdos,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nummos, non Animas, curat, egetque cupit.</HI></L></Q>
Which bears the Signification following, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Even what the hungry Wolf in Field would do</HI></L>
<L><HI>To feeding Lambs, &s;o will the Wretch to you:</HI></L>
<L><HI>The cruel Prie&s;t, fierce, covetous, unju&s;t,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For Money, not for &s;ouls, doth cark and lu&s;t.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>And &s;o, in getting us into Pri&s;on again, the Prie&s;t obtained his Point; but he mi&s;&s;ed of his Prey, and never got it.</P>
<P>Many were the loving, &s;weet and &s;en&s;ible Epi&s;tles, that &s;he &s;ent to me, when in Pri&s;on; ever &s;hewing her free Re&s;ignation to the Will of the Lord, in all her Exerci&s;es, which then were great; and with much Cheerfulne&s;s and Patience &s;he went through them. And &s;ince her Decea&s;e, I found the&s;e fol|lowing Lines, which &s;he had written, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Tho' &s;ome on furious Waves be often to&s;s'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And by the &s;tormy Winds oppos'd and cro&s;s'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And watch'd by raving Pirates, &s;urely they</HI></L>
<L><HI>Are kept by one, whom Winds and Waves obey:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tho' &s;ometimes exercis'd, thereby to learn</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who guards and &s;its as Pilot at the Stern,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And with his Arm of Power doth interpo&s;e</HI></L>
<L><HI>Betwixt his Children and their wond'ring Fees.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Oh who would not love, honour, and depend,</HI></L>
<L><HI>On &s;uch a potent, &s;uch a con&s;tant Friend!</HI></L></Q>
So &s;he depended upon the Lord, and he pre&s;erved her.</P>

<L>THE Author of this mi&s;cellaneous Grove,</L>
<L>Was fruitful both in Virtue and in Love:</L>
<L>Read but the following Lines, and thou may'st find,</L>
<L>She was the Mi&s;tre&s;s of a noble Mind;</L>

<L>She us'd no gilded Baits, no Flattery,</L>
<L>No feigned Words, but plain Sincerity;</L>
<L>Which doth be&s;peak her Love, and Virtue too,</L>
<L>Contended one the other to out-do.</L>
<L>In Numbers &s;weet, her warbling Pen hath try'd</L>
<L>Unerring Truth from Error to divide:</L>
<L>Her Lines, thus mea&s;ur'd, have &s;ucce&s;sful been</L>
<L>To turn the wand'ring Mind to &s;earch within;</L>
<L>Where that invaluable Trea&s;ure lies,</L>
<L>Un&s;ought by mo&s;t, di&s;cover'd to the Wi&s;e;</L>
<L>But yet conceal'd and hid from vult'rous Eyes.</L>
<L>'Tis not the common Way, I mu&s;t confe&s;s,</L>
<L>To write in Ver&s;e; although 'tis ne'erthele&s;s</L>

Words or Arguments cannot, without the powerful Influence of the living Eter|nal Word in thy own Heart, re&s;olve or di&s;annul the Con&s;ultations and Rea&s;onings of this kind, that may inwardly ari&s;e, or be by others &s;ugge&s;ted unto thee: Yet this is in my Mind to &s;ignify, touching the Word <HI>[Thou]</HI> that be&s;ides the Properne&s;s there|of, it is the Phra&s;e and Language u&s;ed in Scripture, by &s;ome owned for a Rule; and 'tis mo&s;tly a &s;lavi&s;h Fear of Men, that in the Hearts of tho&s;e that would &s;hun the Cro&s;s, deters from the U&s;e of it. Yet I de&s;ire not to invite thee to a bare Formality, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for until thou art convinced in thy own Mind, that
<PB N="2" REF="043092_0036_101CC9391410FE50">
the Day of &s;mall Things is not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, and knowe&s;t that Power and Love which capacitates and enables to undergo Trials; which are indeed but momentary, in compari&s;on of the exceeding Weight of Glory, that unto the Faithful is and &s;hall be revealed, it &s;ignifies little; but it is written, <HI>He that will be my Di&s;ciple, mu&s;t take up the Cro&s;s,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>As for the Names of Days or Months, as now u&s;ed, they are contrary to Scripture, where it is written, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;econd,</HI> &amp;c. as in <HI>John</HI> xx. 1, 19. and in <HI>Zephaniah</HI> iii. 9. there is a Promi&s;e, <HI>I will turn the People to a pure Language,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I will take away the Names of Baalim out of her Mouth,</HI> Ho&s;. ii. 17.</P>
<P>Now concerning outward Sacraments, as thou terme&s;t them; they indeed are outward only, and Shadows; but the Sub&s;tance being come, they flee away. Neither can outward Water purify the Con&s;cience, nor outward Bread nouri&s;h the immor|tal Soul.

<L>Reciprocal Reflections of its Beams</L>

<L>Thus, by this needful Freedom, <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> &s;hines</L>

<L>Exchanging Thoughts, they may in any kind</L>
