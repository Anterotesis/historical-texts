<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL conclude our cour&s;e of lectures, by delivering to you a few directions for the regulation of your future conduct and &s;tudies, in the line of your profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> &s;ugge&s;t the mo&s;t probable means of e&s;tabli&s;hing your&s;elves in bu&s;ine&s;s, and of becoming acceptable to your pa|tients, and re&s;pectable in life.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> I &s;hall mention a few thoughts which have occurred to me on the mode to be pur&s;ued, in the further pro&s;ecution of your &s;tudies, and for the improvement of medicine.</P>
<P N="1">I. Permit me, in the fir&s;t place, to recommend to &s;uch of you as intend to &s;ettle in the country, to e&s;tabli&s;h your&s;elves as early as po&s;&s;ible upon <HI>farms.</HI> My rea&s;ons for this advice are as follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. It will reconcile the country people to the liberality and dignity of your profe&s;&s;ion, by &s;hewing them that you a&s;&s;ume no &s;uperiority over them from your education, and that you intend to &s;hare with them in tho&s;e toils, which were impo&s;ed upon man in con&s;equence of the lo&s;s of his innocence. This will prevent envy, and render you acceptable to your patients as men, as well as phy&s;icians.</P>
<P N="2">2. By living on a farm you may &s;erve your country by pro|moting improvements in agriculture. Chemi&s;try (which is now an important branch of a medical education) and agriculture are clo&s;ely allied to each other. Hence &s;ome of the mo&s;t u&s;eful books upon agriculture have been written by phy&s;icians. Witne&s;s the e&s;&s;ays of Dr. Home of Edinburgh, and of Dr. Hunter of York|&s;hire in England.</P>
<P N="3">3. The bu&s;ine&s;s of a farm will furni&s;h you with employment in the healthy &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and thereby deliver you from the taedium vitae, or what is wor&s;e, from retreating to low or impro|per company. Perhaps one cau&s;e of the prevalence of dram or grog drinking, with which country practitioners are &s;o generally charged, is owing to their having no regular or profitable bu&s;ine&s;s to employ them in the intervals of their attendance upon their patients.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="4" REF="045581_0003_102047015E6F3E98">4. The re&s;ources of a farm will create &s;uch an independence as will enable you to practice with more dignity, and at the &s;ame time &s;creen you from the trouble of performing unnece&s;&s;ary &s;er|vices to your patients. It will change the nature of the obligati|on between you and them. While <HI>money</HI> is the only means of your &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, your patients will feel that they are the channels of your daily bread; but while your farm furni&s;hes you with the nece&s;&s;aries of life, your patients will feel more &s;en&s;ibly, that the obligation is on their &s;ide, for health and life.</P>
<P N="5">5. The exigencies and wants of a farm, in <HI>&s;tock</HI> and <HI>labor</HI> of all kinds, will enable you to obtain from your patients a compen|&s;ation for your &s;ervices in tho&s;e articles. They all po&s;&s;e&s;s them, and men part with that of which money is only the &s;ign, much more readily than they do with money it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="6">6. The re&s;ources of a farm will prevent your cheri&s;hing, for a moment, an impious wi&s;h for the prevalence of &s;ickne&s;s in your neighbourhood. A healthy &s;ea&s;on will enable you to add to the produce of your farm, while the rewards of an unhealthy &s;ea&s;on will enable you to repair the inconvenience of your nece&s;&s;ary ab|&s;ence from it. By the&s;e means your pur&s;uits will be marked by that <HI>variety</HI> and <HI>integrity,</HI> in which true happine&s;s is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. Let your farms be &s;mall, and let your <HI>principal</HI> attention be directed to gra&s;s and horticulture. The&s;e afford mo&s;t amu&s;ement, require only moderate labor, and will interfere lea&s;t with your duties to your profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">II. Avoid &s;ingularities of every kind in your manners, dre&s;s, and general conduct. Sir I&s;aac Newton, it is &s;aid, could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed in company, by any peculiarity, from a common well-bred gentleman. Singularity in any thing, is a &s;ub&s;titute for &s;uch great or u&s;eful qualities as command re&s;pect; and hence we find it chiefly in little minds. The profane and indelicate combination of extravagant ideas, improperly called wit, and the formal and pompous manner, whether accompanied by a wig, a cane, or a ring, &s;hould all be avoided, as incompatible with the &s;im|plicity of &s;cience and the real dignity of phy&s;ic. There is more than one way of playing the quack. It is not nece&s;&s;ary, for this pur|po&s;e, that a man &s;hould adverti&s;e his &s;kill, or his cures, or that he &s;hould mount a phaeton and di&s;play his dexterity in operating to an ignorant and gaping multitude. A phy&s;ician acts the &s;ame part in a different way, who a&s;&s;umes the character of a madman or a brute in his manners, or who conceals his fallibility by an affected gravity and taciturnity in his intercour&s;e with his patients. Both characters, like the quack, impo&s;e upon the public. It is true,
<PB N="5" REF="045581_0004_10204702F6C06B20" MS="y">
they deceive different ranks of people; but, we mu&s;t remember that there are two kinds of vulgar&punc; viz. the rich and the poor; and that the rich vulgar are often below the poor, in ignorance and credulity.</P>
<P N="3">III. It has been objected to our profe&s;&s;ion, that many eminent phy&s;icians have been unfriendly to chri&s;tianity. If this be true, I cannot help a&s;cribing it in part to that neglect of public wor&s;hip with which the duties of our profe&s;&s;ion are often incompatible; for it has been ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that the neglect of this religious and &s;ocial duty, generally produces a relaxation, either in princi|ples or morals. Let this fact lead you, in &s;etting out in bu&s;ine&s;s, to acquire &s;uch habits of punctuality in vi&s;iting your patients, as &s;hall not interfere with acts of public homage to the Supreme Be|ing. Dr. Gregory has ob&s;erved, that a cold heart is the mo&s;t fre|quent cau&s;e of dei&s;m. Where this occurs in a phy&s;ician, it affords a pre&s;umption that he is deficient in humanity. But I cannot ad|mit that infidelity is peculiar to our profe&s;&s;ion. On the contrary, I believe chri&s;tianity places among its friends more men of exten|&s;ive abilities and learning than any other &s;ecular employment. Stahl, Hoffman, Boerhaave, Sydenham, Haller and Fothergill were all chri&s;tians. The&s;e enlightened phy&s;icians were con|&s;idered as the ornaments of the ages in which they lived, and po&s;terity has ju&s;tly ranked them among the greate&s;t benefactors of mankind.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Permit me to recommend to you a regard to all the inte|re&s;ts of your country. The education of a phy&s;ician gives him a peculiar in&s;ight into the principles of many u&s;eful arts, and the practice of phy&s;ic favours his opportunities of doing good, by diffu&s;ing knowledge of all kinds. It was in Rome, when medi|cine was practi&s;ed only by &s;laves, that phy&s;icians were condemn|ed by their profe&s;&s;ion "mutam exercere artem." But in modern times, and in free governments, they &s;hould di&s;claim an ignoble &s;ilence upon public &s;ubjects. The hi&s;tory of the American revo|lution has re&s;cued phy&s;ic from its former &s;lavi&s;h rank in &s;ociety. For the honor of our profe&s;&s;ion it &s;hould be recorded, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t intelligent and u&s;eful characters, both in the cabinet and the field during the late war, have been phy&s;icians. The il|lu&s;trious Dr. Fothergill oppo&s;ed faction and tyranny, and took the lead in all public improvements in his native country, with|out &s;uffering thereby the lea&s;t diminution of that reputation, or bu&s;ine&s;s, in which, for forty years, he flouri&s;hed almo&s;t without a rival in the city of London.</P>
<P N="5">V. Let me advi&s;e you, in your vi&s;its to the &s;ick, <HI>never</HI> to ap|pear in a hurry, nor to talk of indifferent matters before you have
<PB N="6" REF="045581_0005_10204705733446C0">
made the nece&s;&s;ary inquiries into the &s;ymptoms of your patient's di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Avoid making light of any ca&s;e. "Re&s;pice finem" &s;hould be the motto of every indi&s;po&s;ition. There is &s;carcely a di&s;order &s;o trifling, that has not, directly, or indirectly, proved an outlet to human life. This con&s;ideration &s;hould make you anxious and punctual in your attendance upon every acute di&s;ea&s;e, and keep you from ri&s;king your reputation by an improper or ha&s;ty progno&s;is.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Do not condemn, or oppo&s;e, unnece&s;&s;arily, the &s;imple pre|&s;criptions of your patients. Yield to them in matters of little con&s;equence, but maintain an inflexible authority over them in matters that are e&s;&s;ential to life.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Pre&s;erve, upon all occa&s;ions, a compo&s;ed or cheerful coun|tenance in the room of your patients, and in&s;pire as much hope of a recovery as you can, con&s;i&s;tent with truth, e&s;pecially in acute di&s;ea&s;es. The extent of the influence of the will over the human body, has not yet been fully a&s;certained. I reject the futile pre|ten&s;ions of Mr. Me&s;mer to the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, by what he has ab&s;urdly called animal magneti&s;m. But I am willing to derive the &s;ame advantages from his deceptions, which the chemi&s;ts have derived from the delu&s;ions of the alchemi&s;ts. The facts which he has e&s;tabli&s;hed, clearly prove the influence of the imagination and will upon di&s;ea&s;es. Let us avail our&s;elves of the handle which the&s;e powers of the mind pre&s;ent to us, in the &s;trife between life and death. I have frequently pre&s;cribed remedies of doubtful ef|ficacy in the critical &s;tage of acute di&s;ea&s;es, but never till I had worked up my patients into a confidence, bordering upon certain|ty, of their probable good effects. The &s;ucce&s;s of this mea&s;ure has much oftener an&s;wered, than di&s;appointed my expectations; and while my patients have commended the vomit, the purge, or the bli&s;ter which was pre&s;cribed, I have been di&s;po&s;ed to attribute their recovery to the vigorous concurrence of the <HI>will</HI> in the ac|tion of the medicine. Does the will beget in&s;en&s;ibility to cold, heat, hunger, and danger? Does it &s;u&s;pend pain, and rai&s;e the body above feeling the pangs of Indian tortures? Let us not then be &s;urpri&s;ed that it &s;hould enable the &s;y&s;tem to re&s;olve a &s;pa&s;m, to open an ob&s;truction, or to di&s;charge an offending humor. I have only time to hint at this &s;ubject. Perhaps it would lead us, if we could trace it fully, to &s;ome very important di&s;coveries in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Permit me to advi&s;e you to attend to that principle in the human mind, which con&s;titutes the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas,
<PB N="7" REF="045581_0006_1020470751222778">
in your intercour&s;e with your patients. A chamber, a chair, a curtain, or even a cup, all belong to the means of life or death, accordingly as they are a&s;&s;ociated with cheerful or di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ideas, in the mind of a patient. But this principle is of more immedi|ate application in tho&s;e chronic di&s;ea&s;es which affect the mind. Nothing can be accompli&s;hed here, till we produce a new a&s;&s;o|ciation of ideas. For this purpo&s;e, a change of place and com|pany are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. But we mu&s;t &s;ometimes proceed much further. I have heard of a gentleman in South-Carolina who cured his fits of low &s;pirits by changing his clothes. The remedy was a rational one. It produced at once a new train of ideas, and thus removed the paroxy&s;m of his di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="10">X. Make it a rule never to be angry at any thing a &s;ick man &s;ays or does to you. Sickne&s;s often adds to the natural irritability of the temper. We are, therefore, to bear the reproaches of our patients with meekne&s;s and &s;ilence. It is folly to re&s;ent injuries at any time, but it is cowardice to re&s;ent an injury from a &s;ick man; &s;ince, from his weakne&s;s and dependence upon us, he is unable to contend with us upon equal terms. You will find it difficult to attach your patients to you by the obligation of friend|&s;hip or gratitude. You will &s;ometimes have the mortification of being de&s;erted by tho&s;e patients who owe mo&s;t to your &s;kill and humanity. This led Dr. Turner to advi&s;e phy&s;icians never to chu&s;e their friends from among their patients. But this advice can never be followed by a heart that has been taught to love true excellen|cy, where ever it finds it. I would rather advi&s;e you to give the benevolent feelings of your hearts full &s;cope, and to forget the unkind returns they will often meet with, by giving to human nature&mdash;a tear.&mdash;</P>
<P N="11">XI. Avoid giving a patient over in an acute di&s;ea&s;e. It is im|po&s;&s;ible to tell in &s;uch ca&s;es where life ends, and where death be|gins. Hundreds of patients have recovered, who have been pro|nounced incurable, to the great di&s;grace of our profe&s;&s;ion. I know that the practice of predicting danger and death upon every occa&s;ion, is &s;ometimes made u&s;e of by phy&s;icians, in order to en|hance the credit of their pre&s;criptions if their patients recover, and to &s;ecure a retreat from blame, if they &s;hould die. But this mode of acting is mean and illiberal. It is not nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould decide with confidence at any time, upon the i&s;&s;ue of a di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="12">XII. I &s;hall now give &s;ome directions with re&s;pect to the me|thod of charging for your &s;ervices to your patients.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="045581_0007_10204708DEAF3D68">When we con&s;ider the expence of a medical education, and the &s;acrifices a phy&s;ician is obliged to make of ea&s;e, &s;ociety, and even health, to his profe&s;&s;ion; and when we add to the&s;e, the con&s;tant and painful anxiety which is connected with the impor|tant charge of the lives of our fellow-creatures, and above all, the ine&s;timable value of that ble&s;&s;ing which is the object of his &s;ervices, I hardly know how it is po&s;&s;ible for a patient &s;ufficiently and ju&s;tly to reward his phy&s;ician. But when we con&s;ider, on the other hand, that &s;ickne&s;s deprives men of the means of ac|quiring money; that it increa&s;es all the expences of living; and that high charges often drive patients from regular-bred phy&s;ici|ans to quacks; I &s;ay, when we attend to the&s;e con&s;iderations, we &s;hould make our charges as moderate as po&s;&s;ible, and conform them to the following &s;tate of things.</P>
<P>Avoid mea&s;uring your &s;ervices to your patients by &s;cruples drachms, and ounces. It is an illiberal mode of charging. On the contrary, let the number and the <HI>time</HI> of your vi&s;its, the na|ture of your patient's di&s;ea&s;e, and his rank in his family or &s;o|ciety, determine the figures in your accounts. It is certainly ju&s;t to charge more for curing an apoplexy, than an intermitting fever. It is equally ju&s;t, to demand more for ri&s;king your life by vi&s;iting a patient in a contagious fever, than for curing a pleuri&s;y. You have a right likewi&s;e to be paid for your anxiety. Charge the &s;ame &s;ervices, therefore, higher to the ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s of a family, or to an only &s;on or daughter, who call forth all your feelings and indu&s;try, than to le&s;s important members of a family and of &s;ociety. If a rich man demands more frequent vi&s;its than are nece&s;&s;ary, and if he impo&s;es the re&s;traints of keeping to hours by calling in other phy&s;icians to con&s;ult with you upon every trifling occa&s;ion, it will be ju&s;t to make him pay accordingly for it. As this mode of charging is &s;trictly agreeable to rea&s;on and equity, it &s;eldom fails of according with the rea&s;on and &s;en&s;e of equity of our patients. Accounts made out upon the&s;e principles, are &s;eldom complained of by them. I &s;hall only remark further upon this &s;ubject, that the &s;ooner you &s;end in your accounts after your patients recover, the better. It is the duty of a phy&s;ician to inform his patient of the amount of his obligation to him at lea&s;t <HI>once</HI> a year. But there are times when a departure from this rule may be nece&s;&s;ary. An unexpected misfortune in bu&s;ine&s;s, and a variety of other accidents, may deprive a patient of the money he had allotted to pay his phy&s;ician. In this ca&s;e, delica|cy and humanity require, that he &s;hould not know the amount of his debt to his phy&s;ician, till time had bettered his circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="045581_0008_1020470A97B90368">I &s;hall only add, under this head, that the poor of every de|&s;cription &s;hould be the objects of your peculiar care. Dr. Boer|haave u&s;ed to &s;ay,
<Q>they were his be&s;t patients, becau&s;e God was their payma&s;ter.</Q>
The fir&s;t phy&s;icians that I have known, have found the poor the &s;teps by which they have a&s;cended to bu|&s;ine&s;s and reputation. Di&s;ea&s;es among the lower cla&s;s of people are generally &s;imple, and exhibit to a phy&s;ician the be&s;t ca&s;es of all epidemics, which cannot fail of adding to his ability of curing the complicated di&s;ea&s;es of the rich and intemperate. There is an in&s;eparable connection between a man's duty and his intere&s;t. Whenever you are called, therefore, to vi&s;it a poor pa|tient, imagine you hear the voice of the good Samaritan &s;ounding in your ears,
<Q>Take care of him, and I will repay thee.</Q></P>
<P>I COME now to the &s;econd part of this addre&s;s, which was to point out the be&s;t mode to be pur&s;ued, in the further pro&s;ecu|tion of your &s;tudies, and the improvement of medicine.</P>
<P N="1">I. Give me leave to recommend to you, to open all the dead bodies you can, without doing violence to the feelings of your patients, or the prejudices of the common people. Pre&s;erve a regi&s;ter of the weather, and of its influence upon the vegetable productions of the year. Above all, record the epidemics of every &s;ea&s;on; their times of appearing, and di&s;appearing, and the connection of the weather with each of them. Such records, if publi&s;hed, will be u&s;eful to foreigners, and a trea&s;ure to po&s;|terity. Pre&s;erve, likewi&s;e, an account of chronic ca&s;es. Re|cord the name, age and occupation of your patient; de&s;cribe his di&s;ea&s;e accurately, and the changes produced in it by your re|medies; mention the do&s;es of every medicine you admini&s;ter to him. It is impo&s;&s;ible to tell how much improvement and facility in practice you will find from following the&s;e directions. It has been remarked, that phy&s;icians &s;eldom remember more than the two or three la&s;t years of their practice. The records which have been mentioned, will &s;upply this deficiency of memory, e&s;pecial|ly in that advanced &s;tage of life when the advice of phy&s;icians is &s;uppo&s;ed to be mo&s;t valuable.</P>
<P N="2">II. Permit me to recommend to you further, the &s;tudy of the anatomy (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) of the human mind, commonly called metaphy&s;ics. The reciprocal influence of the body and mind upon each other, can only be a&s;certained by an accurate knowledge of the faculties of the mind, and of their various modes of combination and action. It is the duty of phy&s;icians to a&s;&s;ert their prerogative, and to re&s;cue the mental &s;cience from the u&s;urpations of &s;choolmen and divines. It can
<PB N="10" REF="045581_0009_1020470F2F735E90">
only be perfected by the aid and di&s;coveries of medicine. The authors I would recommend to you upon metaphy&s;ics, are, Butler, Locke, Hartly, Reid, and Beattie. The&s;e ingenious writers have cleared this &s;ublime &s;cience of its technical rubbi&s;h, and rendered it both intelligible and u&s;eful.</P>
<P N="3">III. Let me remind you, that improvement in medicine is not to be derived only from colleges and univer&s;ities. Sy&s;tems of phy&s;ic are the productions of men of genius and learning; but tho&s;e facts which con&s;titute real knowledge, are to be met with in every walk of life. Remember how many of our mo&s;t u&s;eful remedies have been di&s;covered by quacks. Do not be afraid, therefore, of conver&s;ing with them, and of profiting by their ignorance and temerity in the practice of phy&s;ic. Medicine has its Phari&s;ees, as well as religion. But the &s;pirit of this &s;ect is as unfriendly to the advancement of medicine, as it is to chri&s;tian charity. By conver&s;ing with quacks, we may convey in&s;truction to them, and thereby le&s;&s;en the mi&s;chief they might otherwi&s;e do to &s;ociety. But further.&mdash;In the pur&s;uit of medical knowledge, let me advi&s;e you to conver&s;e with nur&s;es and old women. They will often &s;ugge&s;t facts in the hi&s;tory and cure of di&s;ea&s;es which have e&s;caped the mo&s;t &s;agacious ob&s;ervers of nature. Even ne|groes and Indians have &s;ometimes &s;tumbled upon di&s;coveries in medicine. Be not a&s;hamed to inquire into them. There is yet one more &s;ource of information in medicine which &s;hould not be neglected, and that is, to conver&s;e with per&s;ons who have reco|vered from indi&s;po&s;itions without the aid of phy&s;icians. Exa|mine the &s;trength and exertions of nature in the&s;e ca&s;es, and mark the plain and home-made remedy to which they a&s;cribe their recovery. I have found this to be a fruitful &s;ource of in|&s;truction, and have been led to conclude, that if every man in a city, or a di&s;trict, could be called upon to relate to per&s;ons ap|pointed to receive and publi&s;h his narrative, an exact account of the effects of tho&s;e remedies which accident or whim has &s;ugge&s;t|ed to him, it would furni&s;h a very u&s;eful book in medicine. To pre&s;erve the facts thus obtained, let me advi&s;e you to record them in a book to be kept for that purpo&s;e: it may be called a <HI>quack recipe-book.</HI> There is one more advantage that will probably attend the inquiries that have been mentioned; you may di&s;cover di&s;ea&s;es, or &s;ymptoms of di&s;ea&s;es, or even laws of the animal oeconomy, which have no place in our &s;y&s;tems of no&s;ology, or in our theories of phy&s;ic.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Let me recommend to your particular attention, the in|digenous medicines of our country. Cultivate or prepare as many of them as po&s;&s;ible, and endeavour to enlarge the materia medica, by exploring the untrodden fields and fore&s;ts of the

United States. The ipecacuana, the Seneka and Virginia &s;nake roots, the Carolina pink-root, the &s;pice-wood, the &s;a&s;&s;afras, the butter-nut, the thoroughwort, the poke, and the &s;trammonium, are but a &s;mall part of the medical productions of America. I have no doubt but there are many hundred other plants which now ex|hale invaluable medical virtues in the de&s;ert air. Examine, likewi&s;e, the mineral waters, which are &s;o various in their im|pregnation, and &s;o common in all parts of our country. Let not the properties of the in&s;ects of America e&s;cape your inve&s;tigation. We have already di&s;covered among &s;ome of them, a fly equal in its bli&s;tering qualities to the famous fly of Spain. Who knows but it may be re&s;erved for America to furni&s;h the world, from her productions, with cures for &s;ome of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which now elude the power of medicine? Who knows but what, at the foot of the Allegany mountain there blooms a flower that is an infal|lible cure for the epilep&s;y? Perhaps on the Monongahela, or the Potowmac, there may grow a root that &s;hall &s;upply, by its tonic powers, the invigorating effects of the &s;avage or military life in the cure of con&s;umptions. Human mi&s;ery of every kind is evidently on the decline. Happine&s;s, like truth, is an unit. While the world, from the progre&s;s of intellectual, moral and political truth, is becoming a more &s;afe and agreeable abode for man, the votaries of medicine &s;hould not be idle. All the doors and windows of the temple of nature have been thrown open by the convul&s;ions of the late American revolution. This is the time, therefore, to pre&s;s upon her altars. We have already drawn from them di&s;coveries in morals, philo&s;ophy, and government; all of which have human happine&s;s for their objects. Let us pre&s;erve the unity of truth and happine&s;s, by drawing from the &s;ame &s;ource, in the pre&s;ent critical moment, a knowledge of an|tidotes to tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be incurable.</P>
<P>I have now, Gentlemen, only to thank you for the attention with which you have honoured the cour&s;e of lectures which has been delivered to you, and to a&s;&s;ure you, that I &s;hall be happy in rendering you all the &s;ervices that lie in my power, in any way you are plea&s;ed to command me. Accept of my be&s;t wi&s;hes for your happine&s;s, and may the ble&s;&s;ings of hundreds and thou|&s;ands that were ready to peri&s;h, be your portion in life, your comfort in death, and your reward in the world to come.</P>
