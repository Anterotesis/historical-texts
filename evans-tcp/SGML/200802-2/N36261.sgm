<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Pages may be con&s;idered rather as a Collection of the BEAUTIES of M. BERQUIN, than as a literally abridged Tran&s;lation of that Work, &s;everal original Thoughts and Ob&s;ervations being occa&s;ionally introduced into different Parts of them.</P>
<P>The Stories here collected are of the mo&s;t inter|e&s;ting Kind, &s;ince Virtue is con&s;tantly repre&s;ented as the Fountain of Happine&s;s, and Vice as the Source of every Evil. Nothing extravagant or ro|mantic will be found in the&s;e Tales, neither en|chanted Ca&s;tles, nor &s;upernatural Agents, but &s;uch Scenes are exhibited as come within the Reach of the Ob&s;ervations of young People in common Life, the Whole being made familiar by an innocent Turn of Thought and Expre&s;&s;ion, and applied to de&s;cribe their Amu&s;ements, their Pur&s;uits, and their Nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>As a u&s;eful and in&s;tructive <HI>Pocket Looking-Gla&s;s,</HI> we recommend it to the In&s;pection of every Youth, whether Mi&s;s or Ma&s;ter? it is a <HI>Mirror</HI> that will not flatter them, nor lead them into Error; it di&s;plays the Follies and improper Per&s;uits of the youthful Brea&s;t, points out the dangerous Paths they &s;ome|times tread, and clears the Way to the <HI>Temple of Honour and Fame.</HI></P>

</FIGURE> LITTLE ADOLPHUS.</HEAD>
<P>IN one of the villages in the neighbour|hood of the metropolis, lived little Adol|phus, who had the misfortune to lo&s;e his mother, before he had reached his eighth year. Notwith&s;tanding his early age, this lo&s;s made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, and evidently affected the natural gaiety of
<PB N="2" REF="047362_0007_1022CCED83530360">
his di&s;po&s;ition. His aunt, the good Mrs. Clark&s;on, took him home to her hou&s;e, in order to remove him from the &s;cene of his affliction, and to prevent his grief adding to the incon&s;olable &s;orrows of his father.</P>
<P>After the u&s;ual time, they left off their mourning; but, though little Adolphus af|fected chearfulne&s;s, yet his tender heart &s;till felt for the lo&s;s of his mother. His father, whom he &s;ometimes vi&s;ited, could not avoid ob&s;erving how little Adolphus endeavoured to conceal his grief; and this con&s;ideration made him feel the more for the lo&s;s of a wife, who had given birth to &s;o promi&s;ing a child. This made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, that every one fore&s;aw it would bring on his final di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>Poor Adolphus had not been to &s;ee his dear father for &s;ome time; for, whenever he propo&s;ed it to his aunt, &s;he con&s;tantly found &s;ome excu&s;e to put it off. The rea|&s;on was, that Mr. Clark&s;on being &s;o ill, &s;he feared that &s;eeing him in that condition would increa&s;e the grief of Adolphus too much, and lay on his heart a load too heavy for him to &s;upport. In &s;hort, the lo&s;s of his wife, and his unea&s;ine&s;s for his &s;on, put an end to Mr. Clark&s;on's life on the day before he reached the fiftieth year of his age.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="047362_0008_1022CCEF0AC3F370">The next morning, little Adolphus thus addre&s;&s;ed his aunt: "This is my dear fa|ther's birth-day, I will go and &s;ee him, and wi&s;h him joy." She endeavoured to per|&s;uade him from it; but, when &s;he found all her endeavours were in vain, &s;he con&s;ented, and then bur&s;t into a flood of tears. The little youth was alarmed, and almo&s;t afraid to a&s;k any que&s;tions. At la&s;t, "I fear (&s;aid he) my dear papa is either ill or dead. Tell me, my dear aunt, for I mu&s;t and will know: I will &s;leep no more till I &s;ee my dear father, who &s;o tenderly loves me."</P>
<P>Mrs. Clark&s;on was unable to &s;peak; but when Adolphus &s;aw his aunt take out his mourning clothes, he was too well &s;atisfied of what had happened. "My dear papa is dead! (cried he) O my papa, my mam|ma! both dead! What will become of poor Adolphus!" and then fainted, when Mrs. Clark&s;on found it difficult to bring him to his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was a little come to him|&s;elf, "Do not afflict your&s;elf, my dear child, (&s;aid his aunt) your parents are both living in heaven, and will intercede with God to take care of you while on earth. While he ye&s;terday was dying, his la&s;t prayer was for you, and his prayer will be heard."</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="047362_0009_1022CCF342CCB0A8">"What, did my dear father die ye&s;ter|day, while I was thinking of the plea&s;ure I &s;hould this day have on &s;eeing him? Oh! let me go and &s;ee him, &s;ince I cannot now di&s;turb him, or make him unhappy on my account. Pray, my dear aunt, let me go."</P>
<P>Mrs. Clark&s;on could not re&s;i&s;t his impor|tunities, and engaged to go along with him, provided he would promi&s;e to keep him&s;elf compo&s;ed. "You &s;ee my &s;orrow, (&s;aid &s;he) and how much I am grieved for the lo&s;s of a brother, who was good, cha|ritable, and humane, and from who&s;e boun|ty I received the greater part of the means of my livelihood. Though I am now left poor and helple&s;s, yet I tru&s;t in Providence, and you &s;hall &s;ee me cry no more. Let me intreat you, my dear child, to do the &s;ame." Poor Adolphus promi&s;ed he would do as &s;he would wi&s;h him; when Mrs. Clark&s;on took him by the hand, and led him to the melancholy &s;cene.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were come to the hou&s;e, Adolphus &s;lipped from his aunt, and ru&s;h|ing into the room where his father lay in his coffin, &s;urrounded by his weeping neighbours, he threw him&s;elf on the breath|le&s;s body of his dear papa. After lying
<PB N="5" REF="047362_0010_1022CCF7433DC1F8">
&s;ome little time in that &s;tate, without being able to &s;peak, he at la&s;t rai&s;ed his little head, and cried out, "See how your poor Adol|phus cries for having lo&s;t you! When mamma died, you comforted me, though you wept your&s;elf; but now to whom am I to look for comfort? O my dear papa, my good papa!"</P>
<P>By this time his aunt got into the room, and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the neighbours, forced him from the coffin, and carried him to a friend's hou&s;e, in order to keep him there till his father &s;hould be buried; for his aunt dreaded the thoughts of letting him attend the funeral.</P>
<P>The &s;olemn &s;cene was now preparing, and the bell began to toll, which Adolphus heard, and every &s;troke of it pierced his little innocent heart. The woman, to who&s;e care he had been left, having &s;tepped into another room, he took that opportunity to regain his liberty, got out of doors, and ran towards the church-yard. On his arrival there, he found the funeral &s;ervice fini&s;hed, and the grave filling up, when, on a &s;udden, a cry was heard&mdash;"Let me be buried with my dear papa." He then jumped into the grave.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="047362_0011_1022CCF9EC908220">Such a &s;cene mu&s;t naturally affect every one who &s;aw it. They pulled him out of the grave, and carried him home, pale and &s;peechle&s;s. For &s;everal days he refu&s;ed al|mo&s;t every kind of &s;u&s;tenance, being at in|tervals &s;ubject to fainting fits. After &s;ome time, however, the con&s;olations and advice of his good aunt appeared to have &s;ome weight with him, and the tempe&s;t in his little heart began to abate.</P>
<P>This affectionate conduct of Adolphus was the conver&s;ation for miles round their habitation, and at la&s;t reached the ears of a wealthy merchant, who had formerly been a little acquainted with the decea&s;ed Mr. Clark&s;on. He accordingly went to &s;ee the good Adolphus, and, feeling for his di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, took him home with him, and treat|ed him as his &s;on.</P>
<P>Adolphus &s;oon gained the highe&s;t opinion of the merchant, and, as he grew up, grew more and more in his favour. At the age of twenty, he conducted him&s;elf with &s;o much ability and integrity, that the mer|chant took him into partner&s;hip, and mar|ried him to his only daughter.</P>
<P>Adolphus had always too great a &s;oul to be ungenerous; and even during his youn|ger days, he denied him&s;elf every kind of
<PB N="7" REF="047362_0012_1022CCFC9E460FA0">
extravagance, in order to &s;upport his aunt: and when he came into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a wife and fortune, he placed her in a comfortable &s;tation for the remainder of her life. As for him&s;elf, he every year, on his father's birth-day, pa&s;&s;ed it in a retired room alone, &s;ometimes indulging a tear, and &s;ometimes lifting up his heart to heaven, from whence he had received &s;o much.</P>
<P>My little readers, if you have the happi|ne&s;s &s;till to have parents living, be thankful to God, and be &s;en&s;ible of the ble&s;&s;ing you enjoy. Be cautious how you do any thing to offend them; and, &s;hould you offend them unde&s;ignedly, re&s;t neither night nor day till you have obtained their forgive|ne&s;s. Reflect on, and enjoy the happine&s;s that you are not, like poor little Adolphus, bereft of your fathers and mothers, and left in the hands, tho' of a good, yet poor aunt.</P>

</FIGURE> ANABELLA's JOURNEY TO MARKET.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING can be more natural and plea&s;ing than to &s;ee young children fond of their parents. The birds of the air, and even the wild inhabitants of the fore&s;t, love and are beloved by their young progeny.</P>
<P>Little Anabella was &s;ix years old, very fond of her mamma, and delighted in fol|lowing her every where. Her mother be|ing one day obliged to go to market, wi&s;hed to leave her little daughter at home, think|ing it would be too fatiguing for Anabella,
<PB N="9" REF="047362_0014_1022CD0236A73600">
and trouble&s;ome to her&s;elf; but the child's intreaties to go, were &s;o earne&s;t and pre&s;&s;|ing, that her mother could not with&s;tand them, and at la&s;t con&s;ented to her reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The cloak and bonnet was &s;oon on, and the little maid &s;et off with her mamma in high &s;pirits. Such was the badne&s;s of the paths in &s;ome places, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to walk hand in hand, &s;o that Ana|bella was &s;ometimes obliged to trudge on by her&s;elf behind her mamma; but the&s;e were &s;uch kind of hard&s;hips as her little &s;pi|rit was above complaining of.</P>
<P>The town now appeared in &s;ight, and the nearer they approached it, the more the paths were thronged with people. Anabel|la was often &s;eparated from her mamma; but this did not at pre&s;ent much di&s;turb her, as by &s;kipping over a rut, or &s;lipping be|tween people as they pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he &s;oon got up again to her mother. However, the nearer they approached the market, the crowd of cour&s;e encrea&s;ed, which kept her eyes in full employment to &s;py which way her mother went; but a little chai&s;e drawn by &s;ix dogs having attracted her attention, &s;he &s;topped to look at them, and by that means lo&s;t &s;ight of her mother, which &s;oon
<PB N="10" REF="047362_0015_1022CD04EDF18D08">
became the cau&s;e of much unea&s;ine&s;s to her.</P>
<P>Here, my little readers, let me pau&s;e for a moment to give you this nece&s;&s;ary advice. When you walk abroad with your parents or &s;ervants never look much about you, unle&s;s you have hold of their hand, or &s;ome part of their apparel. And I hope it will not be deemed impertinent to give &s;imilar ad|vice to parents and &s;ervants, to take care that children do not wander from them, &s;ince, from &s;uch neglect, many fatal acci|dents have happened. But to proceed.&mdash;</P>
<P>Little Anabella had not gazed on this ob|ject of novelty for more than a minute, be|fore &s;he recollected her mamma, and turn|ed about to look for her; but no mamma was there, and now the afflictions of her heart be|gan. She called aloud, "Mamma; mam|ma;" but no mamma an&s;wered. She then crawled up a bank, which afforded her a view all around; but no mamma was to be &s;een. She now bur&s;t into a flood of tears, and &s;at her&s;elf down at the foot of the bank, by which people were pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing in great numbers.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every body that pa&s;&s;ed &s;aid &s;ome+thing or other to her, but none offered to help her to find her mother. "What is
<PB N="11" REF="047362_0016_1022CD067288D038">
the matter with you, my little dear, (&s;aid one) that you cry &s;o &s;adly?" "I have lo&s;t my mamma!" &s;aid Anabella, as well as the grief of her heart would permit her to &s;peak. Another told her never to mind it, &s;he would find her again by and by. Some &s;aid, "Do not cry &s;o, child, there is nobo|dy that will run away with you." Some pitied her, and others laughed at her; but not one offered to give her any a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Such, my little pupils, is the conduct of mo&s;t people. When any misfortune brings you into trouble, you will find enough rea|dy to pity you, but few who will give you any material a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They will tell you, what you then know your&s;elves, that you &s;hould not have done &s;o and &s;o; they will be &s;orry for you, and then take their leave of you.</P>
<P>Little Anabella, however, was &s;oon re|lieved from her pre&s;ent terrible anxieties. A poor old woman with eggs and butter in a ba&s;ket, happened to be that day going to the &s;ame market, whither Anabella's mo|ther was gone before her.</P>
<P>Seeing Anabella in &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s, &s;till crying as if her little heart would break, &s;he went up to her, and a&s;ked her what was the cau&s;e of tho&s;e tears that fell from her lit|tle
<PB N="12" REF="047362_0017_1022CD0A5C553068">
cheeks. She told her &s;he had lo&s;t her mamma. "And to what place, my dear, (cries the old woman) was your mamma go|ing when you lo&s;t her?" "She was going to the market," replied Anabella. "Well, my &s;weet girl, (continued the old woman) I am going to the market too, and if you will go along with me, I make no doubt but we &s;hall find your mother there. However, I will take care of you till you do find her." She then took Anabella by the hand, and led her along the road.</P>
<P>The good old woman put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a piece of nice plumb-cake, which &s;he gave to Anabella, who thankfully accepted of it; but her lit|tle heart was too full to permit her to think of eating at that time. She therefore put it into her pocket, &s;aying, that &s;he would eat it by and by, when &s;he had found her mamma, which &s;he hoped would be &s;oon.</P>
<P>As they walked along, the good old wo|man endeavoured to amu&s;e Anabella by tel|ling her pretty &s;tories, and enquiring of her what books &s;he read. "I very well know, (&s;aid the old woman) that you young chil|dren are too apt to be fond of hi&s;tories of haunted hou&s;es, of witches, gho&s;ts, and apparitions, which tend only to fill you with
<PB N="13" REF="047362_0018_1022CD0D0D8EDEF8">
with idle fears and apprehen&s;ions, and make you afraid even of your own &s;hadows." But when Anabella told her that her books were all bought at the corner of St. Paul's Church-yard, &s;he &s;eemed perfectly &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>They had hardly entered the market, when the little rambling eyes of Anabella caught &s;ight of her mamma. She &s;hriek|ed with joy, and, like an arrow out of a bow, darted from the old woman, and flew to her parent, who cla&s;ped her pretty dear in her arms, and, after tenderly embracing her, "How came you, (&s;aid &s;he) my &s;weet angel, to wander from me? I have been &s;o frightened, as to be hardly able to contain my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Anabella threw her arms round the neck of her mamma, and fixing her lips to her cheeks, kept ki&s;&s;ing her, till a torrent of tears gave ea&s;e to her heart. As &s;oon as &s;he was able to &s;peak, "My dear mamma, (&s;aid &s;he) I &s;topped to look at a pretty little chai&s;e drawn by &s;ix dogs, and in the mean time I lo&s;t you. I looked for you, and called for you, but I could neither &s;ee nor hear you. I &s;at down crying by the &s;ide of a bank; &s;ome as they pa&s;&s;ed pitied me, and others joked me; but none attempted to
<PB N="14" REF="047362_0019_1022CD0FB642D6B0">
take care of me, till this good old woman led me by the hand, and brought me here."</P>
<P>Anabella's mother was very thankful to the good old woman for her tenderne&s;s and humanity to her daughter, and not only bought of her what eggs and butter &s;he had left, but even made her a &s;mall pre&s;ent be|&s;ides, which &s;he a long time declined ac|cepting of, &s;aying, &s;he had done no more than what every good Chri&s;tian ought to do.</P>
<P>Anabella ki&s;&s;ed the good old woman over and over again, and all her way home talk|ed of nothing but her kindne&s;s. Nor did &s;he afterwards forget it, as &s;he would fre|quently go and pay her a vi&s;it, when &s;he al|ways took with her &s;ome tea and &s;ugar, and a loaf of bread. Anabella's mother con|&s;tantly bought all the eggs and butter the good old woman had to &s;pare, and paid her a better price for them than &s;he could have got at market, &s;aving her, at the &s;ame time, the trouble of going thither.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, my young friends, what are the con&s;equences of good nature and humanity. You mu&s;t accu&s;tom your&s;elves early not only to feel for the misfortunes of others, but to do every thing that lies in your power to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. Whatever may

</FIGURE> THE ABSURDITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE's WISHES EXPOSED.</HEAD>
<P>THE pre&s;ent moment of enjoyment is all young people think of. So long as Ma&s;ter Tommy partook of the plea&s;ure of &s;liding on the ice, and making &s;now up in various &s;hapes, he wi&s;hed it always to be winter, totally regardle&s;s of either &s;pring, &s;ummer, or autumn. His father hearing him one day make that wi&s;h, de&s;ired him to write it down in the fir&s;t leaf of his pocket-book,
<PB N="17" REF="047362_0022_1022CD17D69E0A00">
which Tommy accordingly did, though his hand &s;hivered with cold.</P>
<P>The winter glided away imperceptibly, and the &s;pring followed in due time. Tom|my now walked in the garden with his fa|ther, and with admiration beheld the ri&s;ing beauty of the various &s;pring flowers. Their perfume afforded him the highe&s;t delight, and their brilliant appearance attracted all his attention. "Oh, (&s;aid Ma&s;ter Tom|my) that it were always &s;pring!" His fa|ther de&s;ired him to write that wi&s;h al&s;o in his pocket-book.</P>
<P>The trees, which were lately only bud|ding, were now grown into full leaf, the &s;ure &s;ign that &s;pring was departing, and &s;ummer ha&s;tening on apace. Tommy, one day, accompanied by his parents, and two or three &s;elect acquaintance, went on a vi&s;it to a neighbouring village. Their walk was delightful, affording them a pro&s;pect &s;ome|times of corn yet green, waving &s;moothly like a &s;ea unruffled with the breeze, and &s;ometimes of meadows enamelled with a profu&s;ion of various flowers. The inno|cent lambs &s;kipped and danced about, and the colts and fillies pranced around their dams. But what was &s;till more plea&s;ing,
<PB N="18" REF="047362_0023_1022CD1A8A1CCA78">
this &s;ea&s;on produced for Tommy and his companions a delicious fea&s;t of cherries, &s;trawberries, and a variety of other fruits. So plea&s;ant a day afforded them the &s;um|mit of delight, and their little hearts dan|ced in their bo&s;oms with joy.</P>
<P>"Do you not think, Tommy, (&s;aid his father to him) that &s;ummer has its delights as well as winter and &s;pring?" Tommy re|plied, he wi&s;hed it might be &s;ummer all the year, when his father de&s;ired him to enter that wi&s;h in his pocket-book al&s;o.</P>
<P>The autumn at length arrived, and all the family went into the country to view the harve&s;t. It happened to be one of tho&s;e days that are free from clouds, and yet a gentle we&s;terly wind kept the air cool and refre&s;hing. The gardens and orchards were loaded with fruits, and the fine plums, pears, and apples, which hung on the trees almo&s;t to the ground, furni&s;hed the little vi&s;itors with no &s;mall amu&s;ement and de|light. There were al&s;o plenty of grapes, apricots, and peaches, which ate the &s;weet|er, as they had the plea&s;ure of gathering them. "This &s;ea&s;on of rich abundance, Tommy, (&s;aid his father to him) will &s;oon pa&s;s away, and &s;tern and cold winter will &s;ucceed it." Tommy again wi&s;hed, that
<PB N="19" REF="047362_0024_1022CD1C0D5890A0">
the pre&s;ent happy &s;ea&s;on would always con|tinue, and that winter would not be too ha&s;ty in its approaches, but leave him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of autumn.</P>
<P>Tommy's father de&s;ired him to write this in his book al&s;o, and ordering him to read what he had written, &s;oon convinced him how contradictory his wi&s;hes had been. In the winter, he wi&s;hed it to be always win|ter; in the &s;pring he wi&s;hed for a continu|ance of that &s;ea&s;on; in the &s;ummer, he wi&s;hed it never to depart; and when au|tumn came, it afforded him too many deli|cious fruits to permit him to have a &s;ingle wi&s;h for the approach of winter.</P>
<P>"My dear Tommy, (&s;aid his father to him) I am not di&s;plea&s;ed with you for en|joying the pre&s;ent moment, and thinking it the be&s;t that can happen to you; but you &s;ee how nece&s;&s;ary it is that our wi&s;hes &s;hould not always be complied with. God knows how to govern this world much better than any human being can pretend to. Had you la&s;t winter been indulged in your wi&s;h, we &s;hould have had neither &s;pring, &s;ummer, nor autumn; the earth would have been perpetually covered with &s;now. The bea&s;ts of the field, and the fowls of the air, would either have been &s;tarved or frozen to death;
<PB N="20" REF="047362_0025_1022CD1F0786F0E0">
and even the plea&s;ures of &s;liding, or making images of &s;now, would have &s;oon become tire&s;ome to you. It is a happine&s;s that we have it not in our power to regulate the cour&s;e of nature: the wi&s;e and unerring de&s;igns of Providence, in favour of man|kind, would then mo&s;t probably be pervert|ed to their own inevitable ruin."</P>

</FIGURE> LOUISA's TENDERNESS TO THE LITTLE BIRDS IN WINTER.</HEAD>
<P>HOWEVER long the winter may ap|pear, the &s;pring will naturally &s;ucceed it. A gentle breeze began to warm the air, the &s;now gradually vani&s;hed, the fields put on their enamelled livery, the flowers &s;hot forth their buds, and the birds began to &s;end forth their harmony from every bough.</P>
<P>Little Loui&s;a and her father left the city, to partake of the plea&s;ures of the country. Scarcely had the blackbird and the thru&s;h
<PB N="22" REF="047362_0027_1022CD2593937980" MS="y">
began their early whi&s;tle, to welcome Lou|i&s;a, than the weather changed all on a &s;ud|den; the north-wind roared horribly in the grove, and the &s;now fell in &s;uch abundance, that every thing appeared in a &s;ilver white mantle.</P>
<P>Though the little maid went to bed &s;hi|vering with cold, and much di&s;appointed in her expectations, yet &s;he thanked God for having given her &s;o comfortable a &s;helter from the inclemency of the elements.</P>
<P>Such a quantity of &s;now had fallen du|ring the night, that the roads were almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able in the morning, which was a matter of great affliction to poor Loui&s;a; but &s;he ob&s;erved, that the birds were as dull as her&s;elf upon the occa&s;ion. Every tree and hedge being &s;o covered with &s;now, the poor birds could get nothing to eat, not &s;o much as a grain of corn or worm was to be found.</P>
<P>The feathered inhabitants now for&s;ook the woods and groves, and fled into the neighbourhood of inhabited towns and vil|lages, to &s;eek that relief from man, which nature alone would not then afford them. Incredibly numerous were the flight of &s;parrows, robins, and other birds, that were &s;een in the &s;treets and court-yards,
<PB N="23" REF="047362_0028_1022CD27184564E8">
where their little beaks and claws were em|ployed in turning over whatever they thought could afford them a &s;ingle grain.</P>
<P>A large company of the&s;e feathered re|fugees, alighted in the yard belonging to the hou&s;e, in which little Loui&s;a and her father then were. The di&s;tre&s;s of the poor birds &s;eemed to afflict the tender-hearted maid very much, which her father perceiv|ed as &s;oon as &s;he entered his chamber.&mdash; "What is it makes you look &s;o pen&s;ive now, (&s;aid her father) &s;ince it is but a few minutes ago when you was &s;o remarkably chearful?"&mdash;"O my dear papa, (&s;aid Lou|i&s;a) all tho&s;e &s;weet dear birds, that &s;ung &s;o charmingly but a day or two ago, are now come into the yard &s;tarving with hunger. Do, pray, let me give them a little corn!"</P>
<P>Her papa very readily granted her &s;o rea|&s;onable a reque&s;t, and away &s;he ran, ac|companied by her governe&s;s, to the barn on the other &s;ide of the yard, which had that morning been cleanly &s;wept. Here &s;he get a handful or two of corn, which &s;he im|mediately &s;cattered in different parts of the yard. The poor little birds fluttered around her, and &s;oon picked up what the bounty of her generous hand had be&s;towed on them.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the plea&s;ure
<PB N="24" REF="047362_0029_1022CD29F8E28BB8">
and &s;atisfaction, expre&s;&s;ed in the counte|nance of Loui&s;a, on &s;eeing her&s;elf the cau&s;e of giving &s;o much joy to tho&s;e little animals. As &s;oon as the birds had picked up all the grains, they flew to the hou&s;e-top, and &s;eemed to look down on Loui&s;a as if they would &s;ay, "Cannot you give us a little more?" She under&s;tood their meaning, and away &s;he flew again to the barn, and down they all came to partake of her new bounty, while Loui&s;a called to her papa and mamma to come and enjoy with her the plea&s;ing &s;ight.</P>
<P>In the mean time, a little boy came into the yard, who&s;e heart was not of &s;o tender a nature as Loui&s;a's. He held in his hand a cage full of birds, but carried it &s;o care|le&s;sly, that it was evident he cared very lit|tle for his poor pri&s;oners. Loui&s;a, who could not bear to &s;ee the pretty little crea|tures u&s;ed &s;o roughly, a&s;ked the boy what he was going to do with tho&s;e birds. The boy replied, that he would &s;ell them if he could, but if he could not, his cat &s;hould have a dainty meal of them, and they would not be the fir&s;t &s;he had munched alive.</P>
<P>'O fie, (&s;aid Loui&s;a) give them to your cat! What, &s;uffer &s;uch innocent things as tho&s;e to be killed by the mercile&s;s talons of
<PB N="25" REF="047362_0030_1022CD2DF7574068">
a cat!"&mdash;"Even &s;o," &s;aid the boy, and giving the cage a carele&s;s &s;wing, that tum|bled the poor birds one over another, off he was &s;etting, when Loui&s;a called him back, and a&s;ked him what he would have for his birds. "I will &s;ell them, (&s;aid he) three for a penny, and there are eighteen of them." Loui&s;a &s;truck the bargain, and ran to beg the money of her papa, who not only chearfully gave her the money, but allowed her an empty room for the recep|tion of her little captives.</P>
<P>The boy, having thus found &s;o good a market for his birds, told all his compa|nions of it; &s;o that, in a few hours, Lou|i&s;a's yard was &s;o filled with little bird mer|chants, that you would have &s;uppo&s;ed it to be a bird market. However, the pretty maiden purcha&s;ed all they brought, and had them turned into the &s;ame room with tho&s;e of her former purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>When night came, Loui&s;a went to bed with more plea&s;ure than &s;he had felt for a long time. "What a plea&s;ing reflection it is, (&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf) to be thus capable of pre&s;erving the lives of &s;o many innocent birds, and &s;ave them from famine and mer|cile&s;s cats! When &s;ummer comes, and I
<PB N="26" REF="047362_0031_1022CD30A5299878">
go into the woods and groves, the&s;e pretty birds will fly round me, and &s;ing their &s;weete&s;t notes, in gratitude for my kind at|tention to them." The&s;e thoughts at la&s;t lulled her to &s;leep, but they accompanied her even in her dreams; for &s;he fancied her|&s;elf in one of the mo&s;t delightful groves &s;he had ever &s;een, where all the little birds were bu&s;ied, either in feeding their young, or in &s;inging, or in hopping from bough to bough.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing Loui&s;a did after &s;he had got up in the morning, was to go and feed her little family in the room, and al&s;o tho&s;e that came into the yard. Though the &s;eed to feed them co&s;t her nothing, yet &s;he re|collected that the many purcha&s;es &s;he had lately made of birds mu&s;t have almo&s;t ex|hau&s;ted her pur&s;e; "and if the fro&s;t &s;hould continue, (&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf) what will be|come of tho&s;e poor birds that I &s;hall not be able to purcha&s;e! Tho&s;e naughty boys will either give them to their cats, or &s;uffer them to die with hunger."</P>
<P>While &s;he was giving way to the&s;e &s;or|rowful reflections, her hand was moving gently into her pocket, in order to bring out her exhau&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> pur&s;e; but judge what mu&s;t be her &s;urpri&s;e and a&s;toni&s;hment when,
<PB N="27" REF="047362_0032_1022CD3228DA7F00">
in&s;tead of pulling out an empty pur&s;e, &s;he found it brim full of money. She ran im|mediately to her papa, to tell him of this &s;trange circum&s;tance, when he &s;natched her up in his arms, tenderly embraced her, and &s;hed tears of joy on her blooming cheeks.</P>
<P>"My dear child, (&s;aid her papa to her) you cannot conceive how happy you make me! Let the&s;e little birds continue to be the object of your relief, and, be a&s;&s;ured, your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">r&s;e &s;hall never be reduced to empti|ne&s;s." This plea&s;ing news gladdened the little heart of Loui&s;a, and &s;he ran immedi|ately to fill her apron with &s;eed, and then ha&s;tened to feed her feathered gue&s;ts. The birds came fluttering round her, and &s;eem|ed con&s;cious of her bounty and genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>After feeding the&s;e happy pri&s;oners, &s;he went down into the yard, and there di&s;tri|buted a plentiful meal to the &s;tarving wan|derers without. What an important tru&s;t &s;he had taken on her&s;elf!&mdash;nothing le&s;s than the &s;upport of an hundred dependents with|in doors, and a &s;till greater number with|out! No wonder that her dolls and other play-things &s;hould be now totally for|gotten.</P>
<P>As Loui&s;a was putting her hand in|to the &s;eed-bag, to take out of it the
<PB N="28" REF="047362_0033_1022CD3601B7ED18">
afternoon food for her birds, &s;he found a paper, on which was written the&s;e words: "The inhabitants of the air fly towards thee, O Lord! and thou give&s;t them their food; thou opene&s;t thy hand, and fille&s;t all things living with plenteou&s;ne&s;s."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;aw her papa behind her, &s;he turned round and &s;aid, "I am therefore now imitating God."&mdash;"Yes, my &s;weet Loui&s;a, (&s;aid her father) in every good action we imitate our Maker. When you &s;hall be grown to maturity, you will then a&s;&s;i&s;t the nece&s;&s;itous part of the human race, as you now do the birds; and the more good you do, the nearer you will approach the perfections of God."</P>
<P>Loui&s;a continued her attention to feed her hungry birds for more than a week, when the &s;now began to melt, and the fields by degrees recovered their former verdure. The birds, who had lately been afraid to quit the warm &s;helter of the hou&s;es, now returned to the woods and groves. The birds in our little Loui&s;a's aviary were con|fined, and therefore could not get away; but they &s;howed their inclination to depart, by flying again&s;t the windows, and pecking the gla&s;s with their bills. The&s;e birds, perhaps, were indu&s;trious, and wi&s;hed not
<PB N="29" REF="047362_0034_1022CD38D0F39980">
to be trouble&s;ome to Loui&s;a, &s;ince they could now procure their own living.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a, not being able to comprehend what could make them &s;o unea&s;y, a&s;ked her papa if he could tell the cau&s;e of it. "I know not, my dear, (&s;aid her papa) but it is po&s;&s;ible the&s;e little birds may have left &s;ome companions in the fields, which they now wi&s;h to &s;ee."&mdash;"You are very right, papa, (replied Loui&s;a) and they &s;hall have their liberty immediately." She ac|cordingly opened the window, and all the birds &s;oon flew out of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e little feathered animals had no &s;ooner obtained their liberty, than &s;ome were &s;een hopping on the ground, others darting in the air, or &s;porting in the trees from twig to twig, and &s;ome flying about the windows chirping, as though out of gratitude to their benefactor.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a hardly ever went into the fields, but &s;he fancied that &s;ome of her little fami|ly &s;eemed to welcome her approach, either by hopping before her, or entertaining her with their melodious notes, which afforded her a &s;ource of inexhau&s;tible plea&s;ure.</P>

</FIGURE> THE STORY OF BERTRAND, A POOR LA+BOURER, AND HIS LITTLE FAMILY.</HEAD>
<P>THINK your&s;elves happy, my little readers, &s;ince none of you perhaps know what it is to endure hunger day after day, without being able to enjoy one plen|tiful meal. Confident I am, that the fol|lowing relation will not fail to make an im|pre&s;&s;ion on your tender hearts.</P>
<P>Bertrand was a poor labourer, who had &s;ix young children, whom he maintained
<PB N="31" REF="047362_0036_1022CD3E30B986A8">
with the utmo&s;t difficulty. To add to his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, an unfavourable &s;ea&s;on much en|crea&s;ed the price of bread. This hone&s;t labourer worked day and night to procure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for his family, and though their food was compo&s;ed of the coar&s;e&s;t kind, yet even of that he could not procure a &s;ufficiency.</P>
<P>Finding him&s;elf reduced to extremity, he one day called his little family together, and with tears in his eyes, and a heart overflow|ing with grief, "My &s;weet children, (&s;aid he to them) bread is now &s;o extravagantly dear, that I find all my efforts to &s;upport you ineffectual. My whole day's labour is barely &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e this piece of bread you &s;ee in my hand; it mu&s;t therefore be divided among you, and you mu&s;t be contented with the little my labour can pro|cure you. Though it would not afford you a plentiful meal, yet it will be &s;uffi|cient to keep you from peri&s;hing with hun|ger." Sorrow and tears interrupted his words, and he could &s;ay no more, but lift|ed up his hands and eyes to heaven.</P>
<P>His children wept in &s;ilence, and, young as they were, their little hearts &s;eemed to feel more for their father than for them|&s;elves. Bertrand then divided the &s;mall
<PB N="32" REF="047362_0037_1022CD3FB5E0ADC8">
portion of bread into &s;even equal &s;hares, one of which he kept for him&s;elf, and gave to the re&s;t each their lot. But one of them, named Harry, refu&s;ed his &s;hare, telling his father he could not eat, pretending to be &s;ick. "What is the matter with you, my dear child?" &s;aid his father, taking him up in his arms. "I am very &s;ick, (replied Harry) very &s;ick indeed, and &s;hould be glad to go to &s;leep." Bertrand then carried him to bed, and gave him a tender ki&s;s, wi&s;hing him a good night.</P>
<P>The next morning, the hone&s;t labourer, overwhelmed with &s;orrow, went to a neigh|boring phy&s;ician, and begged of him, as a charity, to come and &s;ee his poor boy.&mdash; Though the phy&s;ician was &s;ure of never be|ing paid for his vi&s;it, yet &s;uch were his hu|manity and feelings, that he in&s;tantly went to the labourer's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>On his arrival there, he found no parti|cular &s;ymptoms of illne&s;s, though the boy was evidently in a very low and langui&s;hing &s;tate. The doctor told him he would &s;end him a cordial draught; but Harry begged he would forbear &s;ending him any thing, as he could do him no good. The doctor was a little angry at this behaviour, and in&s;i&s;ted on knowing what his di&s;order was, threat|ening
<PB N="33" REF="047362_0038_1022CD428B228A48">
him, if he did not tell him immedi|ately, he would go and acquaint his father with his ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>Poor Harry begged the doctor would &s;ay nothing about it to his father, which &s;till more encrea&s;ed the doctors wi&s;h to get at the bottom of this my&s;tery. At la&s;t, poor Harry finding the doctor re&s;olute, de&s;ired his brothers and &s;i&s;ters might leave the room, and he would acquaint him with every particular.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the phy&s;ician had &s;ent the children out of the room, "Alas, Sir, (&s;aid little Harry) in this &s;ea&s;on of &s;carcity, my poor dear father cannot earn bread enough to feed us. What little quantity he can get, he divides equally among us, re&s;erving to him&s;elf the &s;malle&s;t part. To &s;ee my dear brothers and &s;i&s;ters &s;uffer hunger, is more than I can bear; and, as I am the el|de&s;t, and &s;tronger than they, I have there|fore not eaten any my&s;elf, but have divided my &s;hare among them. It is on this ac|count that I pretended to be &s;ick, and una|ble to eat. I be&s;eech you, however, to keep this a &s;ecret from my father."</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician, wiping away a tear which &s;tarted involuntarily from his eye, a&s;ked poor Harry if he were not then hungry.
<PB N="34" REF="047362_0039_1022CD465F9A7440">
He acknowledged indeed that he was hun|gry; but &s;aid that did not give him &s;o much affliction as to &s;ee the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his family. "But my good lad, (&s;aid the doctor) if you do not take &s;ome nouri&s;hment you will die."&mdash;I am indifferent about that, (replied Harry) &s;ince my father will have then one mouth le&s;s to feed, and I &s;hall go to heaven, where I will pray to God to a&s;&s;i&s;t my dear father and my little &s;i&s;ters and brothers."</P>
<P>What heart but what mu&s;t melt with pity and admiration at the relation of &s;uch facts? The generous phy&s;ician, taking up Harry in his arms, and cla&s;ping him to his bo&s;om, "No, my dear little boy, (&s;aid he) thou &s;halt not die. God and I will take care of thy little family, and return thanks to God for having &s;ent me hither. I mu&s;t leave you for the pre&s;ent, but I will &s;oon return."</P>
<P>The good phy&s;ician ha&s;tened home, and ordered one of his &s;ervants to load him&s;elf with refre&s;hments of every kind. He then ha&s;tened to the relief of poor Harry and his &s;tarving brothers and &s;i&s;ters. He made them all &s;it down at the table and eat till they were perfectly &s;atisfied. What could be a more plea&s;ing &s;cene, than that which the good phy&s;ician then beheld, &s;ix pretty

little innocent creatures &s;miling over the bounty of their generous and humane friend!</P>
<P>The doctor, on his departure, de&s;ired Harry to be under no unea&s;ine&s;s, as he &s;hould take care to procure them a &s;upply of whatever might be wanting. He faith|fully performed his promi&s;e, and they had daily cau&s;e of rejoicing at his bounty and benevolence. The doctor's genero&s;ity was imitated by every good per&s;on, to whom he related the affecting &s;cene. From &s;ome they received provi&s;ions, from &s;ome money, and from others clothes and linen.

</FIGURE> NANCY AND HER CANARY BIRD, POOR CHERRY.</HEAD>
<P>AS Nancy was one day looking out of her window, a man happened to come by, crying, "Canary-birds; come buy my Canary-birds." The man had a large cage upon his head, in which the birds hopped about from perch to perch, and made Nan|cy quite in love with them. "Will you buy a pretty bird or two, Mi&s;s?" &s;aid the man. "I have no objection, (replies the
<PB N="38" REF="047362_0043_1022CD51140430F8">
little maid) provided my papa will give me leave. If you will &s;top a little while, I will &s;oon let you know." So away ran Nancy down &s;tairs to her papa, while the birdman put down his cage at the door.</P>
<P>Nancy ran into her papa's chamber quite out of breath, crying, "O dear papa; on|ly come here! here is a man in the &s;treet that has a large cage on his head, with, I dare &s;ay, an hundred Canary-birds in it." "Well, and what of all that? (replied her papa) Why does that &s;eem to rejoice you &s;o much?" Nancy an&s;wering, that &s;he &s;hould be happy to buy one of them, her papa reminded her, that the bird mu&s;t be fed, and &s;hould it be neglected, even only for a day, it would certainly die.</P>
<P>Nancy promi&s;ed, that &s;he would never eat her own breakfa&s;t till &s;he had given her bird his; but her papa reminded her that &s;he was a giddy girl, and that he feared &s;he had promi&s;ed too much. However, there was no getting over her coaxings and wheedlings, &s;o that her papa was at la&s;t obliged to con&s;ent that &s;he &s;hould buy one.</P>
<P>He then took Nancy by the hand, and led her to the door, where the man was waiting with his birds. He cho&s;e the pret|tie&s;t Canary-bird in it; it was a male, of a
<PB N="39" REF="047362_0044_1022CD5296D1E370">
fine lively yellow colour, with a little black tuft upon his head. Nancy was now quite cheerful and happy, and pulling out her pur&s;e gave it to her father to pay for the bird. But what was to be done with the bird without a cage, and Nancy had not money enough? However, on promi&s;ing that &s;he would take great care to feed her bird, her papa bought her a fine new cage, of which he made her a pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Nancy had given her Canary-bird po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new palace, &s;he ran about the hou&s;e, calling her mamma, her brothers and &s;i&s;ters, and all the &s;ervants, to come and &s;ee her pretty Canary-bird, to which &s;he gave the name of Cherry. When any of her little friends came to &s;ee her, the fir&s;t thing &s;he told them was, that &s;he had one of the prettie&s;t Canary-birds in the world. "He is as yellow as gold, (&s;aid &s;he) and he has a little black cre&s;t like the plumes of my mamma's hat. Come, you mu&s;t go and &s;ee him! His name is Cherry."</P>
<P>Cherry was as happy as any bird need wi&s;h to be, under the care of Nancy. Her fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s every morning was to feed Cherry; and whenever there was any cake at table, Cherry was &s;ure to come in for a
<PB N="40" REF="047362_0045_1022CD568729A610">
&s;hare of it. There was always &s;ome bits of &s;ugar in &s;tore for him, and his cage was con&s;tantly decorated with the mo&s;t lively herbage.</P>
<P>Her pretty bird was not ungrateful, but did all in his power to make Nancy &s;en&s;ible how much he was obliged to her. He &s;oon learned to di&s;tingui&s;h her, and the moment he heard her &s;tep into the room, he would flutter his wings, and keep up an ince&s;&s;ant chirping. It is no wonder, therefore, if Cherry and Nancy became very fond of each other.</P>
<P>At the expiration of a week he began to open his little throat, and &s;ung the mo&s;t de|lightful &s;ongs. He would &s;ometimes rai&s;e his notes to &s;o great a height, that you would almo&s;t think he mu&s;t kill him&s;elf with &s;uch va&s;t exertions. Then, after &s;topping a lit|tle, he would begin again, with a tone &s;o &s;weet and powerful, that he was heard in every part of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Nancy would often &s;it for whole hours by his cage, li&s;tening to his melody. Some|times, &s;o attentively would &s;he gaze at him, that &s;he would in&s;en&s;ibly let her work fall out of her hands; and, after he had enter|tained her with his melodious notes, &s;he would regale him with a tune on her bird
<PB N="41" REF="047362_0046_1022CD59325F5320">
organ, which he would endeavour to imi|tate.</P>
<P>In length of time, however, the&s;e plea|&s;ures began to grow familiar to his friend Nancy. Her papa, one day, pre&s;ented her with a book of prints, with which &s;he was &s;o much delighted, that Cherry began to lo&s;e at lea&s;t one half of her attention. As u&s;ual, he would chirp the moment he &s;aw her, let her be at what di&s;tance &s;he would; but Nancy began to take no notice of him, and almo&s;t a week had pa&s;&s;ed, without his receiving a bit of bi&s;cuit, or a fre&s;h &s;upply of chick-weed. He repeated the &s;weete&s;t and mo&s;t harmonious notes that Nancy had taught him, but to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It now appeared too clearly, that new ob|jects began to attract Nancy's attention.&mdash; Her birth day arrived, and her god-father gave her a large jointed doll, which &s;he named Columbine: and this Columbine proved a &s;aid rival to poor Cherry; for, from morning to night, the dre&s;&s;ing and un|dre&s;&s;ing of Mi&s;s Columbine engro&s;&s;ed the whole of her time. What with this, and her carrying her doll up and down &s;tairs, and into every room in the hou&s;e, it was happy for poor Cherry if he got fed by the
<PB N="42" REF="047362_0047_1022CD5BE6A157E0">
evening, and &s;ometimes it happened that he went a whole day without feeding.</P>
<P>One day, however, when Nancy's papa was at table, accidentally ca&s;ting his eyes upon the cage, he &s;aw poor Cherry lying upon its brea&s;t, and panting as it were for life. The poor bird's feathers appeared all rough, and it &s;eemed contracted into a mere lump. Nancy's papa went up clo&s;e to it; but it was unable even to chirp, and the poor little creature had hardly &s;trength enough to breathe. He called to him his little Nancy, and a&s;ked her what was the matter with her bird. Nancy blu&s;hed, &s;aying in a low voice, "Why, papa, I&mdash; &s;omehow, I forgot;" and ran to fetch the feed-box.</P>
<P>Her papa, in the mean time, took down the cage, and found that poor Cherry had not a &s;ingle &s;eed left, nor a drop of water, "Alas, poor bird, (&s;aid he) you have got into carele&s;s hands. Had I fore&s;een this, I would never have bought you." All the company joined in pity for the poor bird, and Nancy ran away into her chamber to ea&s;e her heart in tears. However, her pa|pa, with &s;ome difficulty, brought pretty Cherry to him&s;elf again.</P>
<P>Her father, the next day, ordered Cher|ry
<PB N="43" REF="047362_0048_1022CD5D6A601178">
to be made a pre&s;ent of to a young gen|tleman in the neighbourhood, who, he &s;aid, would take much better care of it than his little thoughtle&s;s daughter; but poor Nan|cy could not bear the idea of parting with her bird, and mo&s;t faithfully promi&s;ed ne|ver more to neglect him.</P>
<P>Her papa, at la&s;t, gave way to her in|treaties; and permitted her to keep little Cherry, but not without a &s;evere repri|mand, and a &s;trict injunction to be more careful for the future. "This poor little creature, (&s;aid her papa) is confined in a pri&s;on, and is therefore totally unable to provide for his own wants. Whenever you want any thing, you know how to get it; but this little bird can neither help him&s;elf, nor make his wants known to others. If ever you let him want &s;eed or water again, look to it."</P>
<P>Nancy bur&s;t out into a flood of tears, took her papa by the hand, and ki&s;&s;ed it; but her heart was &s;o full &s;he could not utter a &s;yllable. Cherry and Nancy were now again good friends, and he for &s;ome time wanted for nothing.</P>
<P>About a month afterwards, her father and mother were obliged to go a little way into the country on &s;ome particular bu&s;i|ne&s;s;
<PB N="44" REF="047362_0049_1022CD6161B0C950">
but, before they &s;et out, he gave Nancy &s;trict charge to take care of poor Cherry. No &s;ooner were her parents gone, than &s;he ran to the cage, and gave Cherry plenty of &s;eed and water.</P>
<P>Little Nancy, now finding her&s;elf alone and at liberty, &s;ent for &s;ome of her compa|nions to come and &s;pend the day with her. The former part of the day they pa&s;&s;ed in blindman's-buff and four corners. She went to bed very much fatigued; but, as &s;oon as &s;he awoke in the morning, &s;he be|gan to think of new plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>She went abroad that day, while poor Cherry was obliged to &s;tay at home and fa&s;t. The &s;econd and third day pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame playful manner as before; but no poor Cherry was thought of. On the fourth day her father and mothe came home, and, as &s;oon as they had ki&s;&s;ed her, her father enquired after poor Cherry. "He is very well," &s;aid Nancy, a little confu&s;ed, and then ran to fetch him &s;ome &s;eed and wa|ter. Alas, poor little Cherry was no more: he was lying upon his beak, and his wings &s;pread, and his back open. Nancy &s;cream|ed out, and wrung her hands, when all the family ran to her, and were witne&s;&s;es of the melancholy &s;cene.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="047362_0050_1022CD6415805D30">"Alas, poor bird, (&s;aid her papa) what a melancholy end ha&s;t thou come to! If I had twi&s;ted thy head off the day I went in|to the country, it would have cau&s;ed you but a moment's pain; but now you have endured all the pangs of hunger and thir&s;t, and expired in extreme agony. However, poor Cherry, you are happy in being out of the hands of &s;o mercile&s;s a guardian."</P>
<P>Nancy was &s;o &s;hocked and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed on the occa&s;ion, that &s;he would have given all her little trea&s;ure, and even all her play-things, to have brought Cherry to life; but it was now too late. Her papa had the bird &s;tuffed, and hung up to the ceiling, in me|mory of Nancy's carele&s;&s;ne&s;s. She dared not even to lift her eyes up to look at it, for whenever &s;he did, it was &s;ure to make her cry. At la&s;t, &s;he prevailed on her pa|pa to have it moved, but not till after many entreaties and repeated acknowledgments of the fault &s;he had been guilty of. When|ever Nancy was guilty of inattention or giddine&s;s, the bird was hung up again in its place, and every one would &s;ay in her hearing, "Alas, poor Cherry, what a cruel death you &s;uffered!"</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, my little friends, what are the &s;ad con&s;equences of inattention,
<PB N="46" REF="047362_0051_1022CD66C4FDE888">
giddine&s;s, and too great a fondne&s;s for plea|&s;ure, which always make us forgetful of what we ought carefully to attend to.</P>

</FIGURE> THE BIRDS, THE THORN-BUSHES, AND THE SHEEP.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Stanhope and his &s;on Gregory were one evening, in the month of May, &s;itting at the foot of a delightful hill, and &s;urveying the beautiful works of nature that &s;urrounded them. The reclining &s;un, now &s;inking into the we&s;t, &s;eemed to clothe every thing with a purple robe. The chear|ful &s;ong of a &s;hepherd called off their at|tention from their meditations on tho&s;e de|lightful
<PB N="48" REF="047362_0053_1022CD6C346C22B0">
pro&s;pects. This &s;hepherd was dri|ving home his flock from the adjacent fields.</P>
<P>Thorn-bu&s;hes grew on each &s;ide of the road, and every &s;heep that approached the thorns was &s;ure to be robbed of &s;ome part of its wool, which a good deal di&s;plea&s;ed little Gregory. "Only &s;ee, papa, (&s;aid he) how the &s;heep are deprived of their wool by tho&s;e bu&s;hes! You have often told me, that God makes nothing in vain; but the&s;e briars &s;eem made only for mi&s;chief: people &s;hould therefore join to de&s;troy them root and branch. Were the poor &s;heep to come often this way, they would be robbed of all their clothing. But that &s;hall not be the ca&s;e, for I will ri&s;e with the &s;un to-mor|row morning, and, with my little bill-hook and &s;nip-&s;nap, I will level all the&s;e briars with the ground. You may come with me, papa, if you plea&s;e, and bring with you an axe. Before breakfa&s;t, we will be able to de&s;troy them all."</P>
<P>Mr. Stanhope replied, "We mu&s;t not go about this bu&s;ine&s;s in too great a hurry, but take a little time to con&s;ider of it; per|haps, there may not be &s;o much cau&s;e for being angry with the&s;e bu&s;hes as you at pre|&s;ent &s;eem to imagine. Have you not &s;een the &s;hepherds about Lammas with a great
<PB N="49" REF="047362_0054_1022CD6EF50CE308">
&s;hears in their hands, take from the trem|bling &s;heep all their wool, not being con|tented with a few locks only?"</P>
<P>Gregory allowed that was true; but they did it in order to make clothes; whereas the hedges robbed the &s;heep without having the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for their wool, and evi|dently for no u&s;eful purpo&s;e. "If it be u&s;ual (&s;aid he) for &s;heep to lo&s;e their cloth|ing at a certain time of the year, then it is much better to take it for our own advan|tage, than to &s;uffer the hedges to pull it off for no end whatever.'</P>
<P>Mr. Stanhope allowed the arguments of little Gregory to be ju&s;t; for nature has gi|ven to every bea&s;t a clothing, and we are obliged from them to borrow our own, o|therwi&s;e we &s;hould be forced to go naked, and expo&s;ed to the inclemency of the ele|ments.</P>
<P>"Very well, papa, (&s;aid Gregory) tho' we want clothing, yet the&s;e bu&s;hes want none: they rob us of what we have need, and therefore down they &s;hall all come with to-morrow morning's ri&s;ing &s;un. And I dare &s;ay, papa, you will come along with me and a&s;&s;i&s;t me."</P>
<P>Mr. Stanhope could not but con&s;ent, and
<PB N="50" REF="047362_0055_1022CD71A94C20D8">
little Gregory thought him&s;elf nothing le&s;s than an Alexander, merely from the expec|tation of de&s;troying at once this formidable band of robbers. He could hardly &s;leep, being &s;o much taken up with the idea of his victories, to which the next morning's &s;un was to be witne&s;s.</P>
<P>The chearful lark had hardly begun to proclaim the approach of morning, when Gregory got up and ran to awake his papa. Mr. Stanhope, though he was very indiffer|ent concerning the fate of the thorn-bu&s;hes, yet he was not di&s;plea&s;ed with having the opportunity of &s;hewing to his little Grego|ry the beauties of the ri&s;ing &s;un. They both dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves immediately, took the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truments, and &s;et out on this important expedition. Young Grego|ry marched forwards with &s;uch ha&s;ty &s;teps, that Mr. Stanhope was obliged to exert him|&s;elf to avoid being left behind.</P>
<P>When they came near to the bu&s;hes, they ob&s;erved a multitude of little birds flying in and out of them, and fluttering their wings, from branch to branch. On &s;eeing this, Mr. Stanhope &s;topped his &s;on, and de&s;ired him to &s;u&s;pend his vengeance a little time, that they might not di&s;turb tho&s;e innocent birds. With this view, they retired to the
<PB N="51" REF="047362_0056_1022CD732DF3DAE0">
foot of the hill where they had &s;at the pre|ceding evening, and from thence examined more particularly what had occa&s;ioned this apparent bu&s;tle among the birds. From hence they plainly &s;aw, that they were em|ployed in carrying away tho&s;e bits of wool in their beaks, which the bu&s;hes had torn from the &s;heep the evening before. There came a multitude of different &s;orts of birds, who loaded them&s;elves with the plunder.</P>
<P>Gregory was quite a&s;toni&s;hed at this &s;ight, and a&s;ked his papa what could be the mean|ing of it. "You by this plainly &s;ee, (re|plied Mr. Stanhope) that Providence pro|vides for creatures of every cla&s;s, and fur|ni&s;hes them with all things nece&s;&s;ary for their convenience and pre&s;ervation. Here, you &s;ee, the poor birds find what is nece&s;&s;a|ry for their habitations, wherein they are to nur&s;e and rear their young, and with this they make a comfortable bed for them&s;elves and their little progeny. The innocent thorn-bu&s;h, again&s;t which you ye&s;terday &s;o loudly exclaimed, is of infinite &s;ervice to the inhabitants of the air; it takes from tho&s;e that are rich only what they can very well &s;pare, in order to &s;atisfy the wants of the poor. Have you now any wi&s;h to cut
<PB N="52" REF="047362_0057_1022CD75DBE37720">
tho&s;e bu&s;hes down, which you will perhaps no longer con&s;ider as robbers?"</P>
<P>Gregory &s;hook his head, and &s;aid, he would not cut the bu&s;hes down for the world. Mr. Stanhope applauded his &s;on for &s;o &s;ay|ing; and after enjoying the &s;weets of the morning, they retired home to breakfa&s;t, leaving the bu&s;hes to flouri&s;h in peace, &s;ince they made &s;o generous a u&s;e of their con|que&s;ts.</P>
<P>My young friends will hence be convin|ced of the impropriety of cheri&s;hing too ha&s;tily prejudices again&s;t any per&s;ons or things, &s;ince, however forbidding or u&s;e|le&s;s they may at fir&s;t &s;ight appear, a more familiar acquaintance with them may di&s;co|ver tho&s;e accompli&s;hments or perfections, which prejudice at fir&s;t ob&s;cured from their ob&s;ervation.</P>

</FIGURE> POOR CRAZY SAMUEL, AND THE MIS|CHIEVOUS BOYS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the city of Bri&s;tol lived a crazy per|&s;on, who&s;e name was Samuel. Whene|ever he went out, he always put four or five <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">higs on his head at once, and as many <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">uffs upon each of his arms.

<P><PB N="54" REF="047362_0059_1022CD7C7275D8C0">Whenever he appeared in the &s;treets, all the idle boys would &s;urround him, crying, "Samuel! Samuel! how do you &s;ell your wigs and your muffs!" Some boys were of &s;uch mi&s;chievous di&s;po&s;itions as to throw dirt and &s;tones at him. Though the unfortunate man generally bore all this treatment very quietly, yet he would &s;ometimes turn about in his own defence, and throw among the rabble that followed him, any thing that came in his way.</P>
<P>A conte&s;t of this nature happened one day near the hou&s;e of Mr. Denton, who, hearing a noi&s;e in the &s;treet, went to the window, and with much regret &s;aw his &s;on Jo&s;eph concerned in the fray. Di&s;plea&s;ed at the &s;ight, he &s;hut down the &s;a&s;h, and went into another room.</P>
<P>When they were at dinner, Mr. Denton a&s;ked his &s;on who the man was, with whom he and other boys in the &s;treet &s;eemed to be &s;o plea&s;ingly engaged. Jo&s;eph &s;aid, it was the crazy man, whom they called Samuel. On his father a&s;king him what had occa|&s;ioned that misfortune, he replied, that it was &s;aid to be in con&s;equence of the lo&s;s of a law-&s;uit, which deprived him of a large e&s;tate.</P>
<P>"Had this man been known to you, (&s;aid Mr. Denton) at the time when he
<PB N="55" REF="047362_0060_1022CD7F22FE4850">
was cheated of his e&s;tate; and had he told you, that he had ju&s;t lo&s;t a large inheritance, which he had long peaceably enjoyed; that all his property was expended in &s;upporting the cau&s;e, and that he had now neither country or town-hou&s;e, in &s;hort nothing up|on earth left; would you then have laughed at this poor man?"</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph with &s;ome confu&s;ion replied, he certainly &s;hould not be guilty of &s;o wicked an action as to laugh at the misfortunes of any man; but &s;hould rather endeavour to comfort him.</P>
<P>"This man, (&s;aid Mr. Denton) is more to be pitied now than he was then, &s;ince to the lo&s;s of his fortune is added that of his &s;en&s;es al&s;o; and yet you have this day been throwing &s;tones at this poor man, and other|wi&s;e in&s;ulting him, who never gave you any cau&s;e." Jo&s;eph &s;eemed very &s;orry for what he had done, a&s;ked his papa's pardon, and promi&s;ed not only never to do the like again, but to prevent others, as much as lay in his power, committing the &s;ame crime.</P>
<P>His father told him, that as to his for|givene&s;s, he freely had it, but that there was another be&s;ides him, who&s;e forgivene&s;s was more nece&s;&s;ary. Little Jo&s;eph thought that his father meant poor Samuel; but
<PB N="56" REF="047362_0061_1022CD81D4086718">
Mr. Denton explained the matter to him. "Had Samuel retained his &s;en&s;es, (&s;aid he) it would be certainly ju&s;t that you &s;hould a&s;k his pardon; but as his di&s;ordered mind will not permit him to receive any apologies, it would be idle to attempt to make any. It is not Samuel, but God, whom you have offended. You have not &s;hewn compa&s;&s;ion to poor Samuel, but, by your unmerited in&s;ults, have added to his misfortunes. Can you think that God will be plea&s;ed with &s;uch conduct?"</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph now plainly perceived whom he had offended, and therefore promi&s;ed that night to a&s;k pardon of God in his prayers. He kept his word, and not only forbore troubling Samuel for &s;everal weeks after|wards, but endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade all his companions from doing the like.</P>
<P>The re&s;olutions of young people, how|ever, are not always to be depended on. So it happened with little Jo&s;eph, who, forgetting the promi&s;es he had made, one day happened to mix with the rabble of boys, who were following and hooting, and playing many naughty tricks with the unfortunate Samuel.</P>
<P>The more he mixed among them, the more he forgot him&s;elf, and at la&s;t became
<PB N="57" REF="047362_0062_1022CD84B3594B50">
as bad as the wor&s;t of them. Samuel's patience, however, being at length tired out by the rude behaviour of the wicked boys that pur&s;ued him, he &s;uddenly turn|ed about, and picking up a large &s;tone, threw it at little Jo&s;eph with &s;uch violence, that it grazed his cheek, and almo&s;t cut off part of his ear.</P>
<P>Poor Jo&s;eph, on feeling the &s;mart occa|&s;ioned by the blow, and finding the blood trickling down his cheek at a great rate, ran home roaring mo&s;t terribly. Mr. Den|ton, however, &s;hewed him no pity, telling him it was the ju&s;t judgment of God for his wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph attempted to ju&s;tify him&s;elf by &s;aying, that he was not the only one who was guilty, and therefore ought not to be the only one that was puni&s;hed. His fa|ther replied, that, as he knew better than the other boys, his crime was the greater. It is indeed but ju&s;tice, that a child who knows the commands of God and his pa|rents, &s;hould be doubly puni&s;hed, when|ever he &s;o far forgets his duty as to run headlong into wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Remember this, my young readers; and, in&s;tead of adding to the afflictions of others, do whatever you can to alleviate
<PB N="58" REF="047362_0063_1022CD87655A7C18">
them, and God will then undoubtedly have compa&s;&s;ion on you, whenever your wants and di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;hall require his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P>THE &s;un was ju&s;t peeping above the ea&s;tern edge of the horizon, to en|liven with his golden rays one of the mo&s;t beautiful mornings of the &s;pring, when Bella went down into the garden to ta&s;te with more plea&s;ure, as &s;he rambled through tho&s;e enchanting walks, the delicacies of a rich cake, of which &s;he intended to make her fir&s;t meal.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="047362_0065_10225983D2737708">Her heart &s;welled with delight, on &s;ur|veying the beauties of the ri&s;ing &s;un, in li&s;tening to the enlivening notes of the lark, and on breathing the plea&s;ing fragrance, which the &s;urrounding &s;hrubs afforded.</P>
<P>Bella was &s;o charmed with this complica|tion of delights, that her &s;weet eyes were bedewed with a moi&s;ture, which re&s;ted on her eye-lids without dropping in tears.&mdash; Her heart felt a gentle &s;en&s;ation, and her mind was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with emotions of bene|volence and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ound of &s;teps in the walk, how|ever, all on a &s;udden, interrupted the&s;e happy feelings, and a little girl came trip|ping towards the &s;ame walk, eating a piece of coar&s;e brown bread with the keene&s;t ap|petite. As &s;he was al&s;o rambling about the garden for amu&s;ement, her eyes wan|dered here and there unfixed; &s;o that &s;he came up clo&s;e to Bella unexpectedly.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the little girl &s;aw it was Mi&s;s Bella, &s;he &s;topped &s;hort, &s;eemed confu&s;ed, and turning about, ran away as fa&s;t as &s;he could; but Bella called to her, and a&s;ked her why &s;he ran away. This made the little girl run the fa&s;ter, and Bella endea|voured to pur&s;ue her; but, not being &s;o much u&s;ed to exerci&s;e, &s;he was &s;oon left
<PB N="61" REF="047362_0066_1022CD90D7B31BB0">
behind. Luckily, as it happened, the lit|tle &s;tranger had turned up a path leading into that in which Bella was. Here they &s;uddenly met, and Bella caught her by the arm, &s;aying, "Come, I have you fa&s;t now; you are my pri&s;oner, and cannot get away from me."</P>
<P>The poor girl was now more frightened than ever, and &s;truggled hard for her liber|ty; but, after &s;ome time, the &s;weet accents of Bella, and her a&s;&s;urance that &s;he meant only to be her friend, having rather allayed her fears, &s;he became a little more tracta|ble, and quietly followed her into one of the &s;ummer-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bella, having made the &s;tranger &s;it down by her, a&s;ked her if &s;he had a father living, and what was his profe&s;&s;ion. The girl told her, that, thank God, her father was living, and that he did any thing for an hone&s;t livelihood. She &s;aid he was then at work in the garden, and had brought her with him that morning.</P>
<P>Bella then ob&s;erving, that the young &s;tranger had got a piece of brown bread in her hand, de&s;ired &s;he would let her ta&s;te it: but &s;he &s;aid it &s;o &s;cratched her throat on &s;wallowing a bit of it, that &s;he could eat
<PB N="62" REF="047362_0067_1022CD925AFD06F0">
no more, and a&s;ked the little girl, why her father did not get better bread for her.&mdash; "Becau&s;e, (replied the &s;tranger) he does not get &s;o much money as your papa; and be&s;ides that, there are four more of us, and we all eat heartily. Sometimes one wants a frock, another a jacket, and all he can get is barely &s;ufficient for us, without lay|ing out hardly any thing upon him&s;elf, though he never mi&s;&s;es a day's work while he has it to do."</P>
<P>Upon Bella's a&s;king her if &s;he ever eat any plum-cake, &s;he &s;aid &s;he did not even know what it was; but &s;he had no &s;ooner put a bit into her mouth, which Mi&s;s Bella gave her, than &s;he &s;aid, &s;he had never in her life ta&s;ted any thing &s;o nice. She then a&s;ked her what was her name; when the girl, ri&s;ing and making her a low curt&s;ey, &s;aid it was Marian.</P>
<P>"Well then, my good Marian, (&s;aid Bella) &s;top here a moment; I will go and a&s;k my governe&s;s for &s;omething for you, and will come back directly; but be &s;ure you do not go away." Marian replied, that &s;he was now no ways afraid of her, and that &s;he &s;hould certainly wait her com|ing back.</P>
<P>Bella ran directly to her governe&s;s, and
<PB N="63" REF="047362_0068_1022CD93DF8D6C50">
begged &s;he would give her &s;ome currant-jelly for a little girl, who had nothing but dry bread for breakfa&s;t. The govern|e&s;s, being highly plea&s;ed with the good-na|ture of her amiable pupil, gave her &s;ome in a cup, and a &s;mall roll al&s;o. Bella in|&s;tantly ran away with it, and coming to Marian, &s;aid &s;he hoped &s;he had not made her wait; but begged her to put down her brown bread till another time, and eat what &s;he had brought her.</P>
<P>Marian, after ta&s;ting the jelly, and &s;mack|ing her lips, &s;aid it was very nice indeed; and a&s;ked Bella if &s;he eat &s;uch every day. Mi&s;s replied, that &s;he eat tho&s;e things fre|quently, and if &s;he would come now and then, &s;he would always give her &s;ome.</P>
<P>They now became very familiar toge|ther, and Mi&s;s Bella a&s;ked Marian a num|ber of que&s;tions, &s;uch as whether &s;he never was &s;ick, &s;eeing her now look &s;o hearty, and in what manner &s;he employed her time.</P>
<P>Marian repli<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">d, &s;he did not know what it was to be &s;ick; and, as to her employ|ments, in winter &s;he went to get &s;traw for the cow, and dry &s;ticks to make the pot boil; in &s;ummer &s;he went to weed the corn, and in harve&s;t-time, to glean and pull hops. In &s;hort, they were never at a lo&s;s for work;
<PB N="64" REF="047362_0069_1022CD9575D55F40">
and &s;he &s;aid her mother would make a &s;ad noi&s;e, if any of her little ones &s;hould take it into their heads to be lazy.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bella ob&s;erving, that her little vi|&s;itor went barefooted, which much &s;urpri|zed her, was induced to a&s;k the rea&s;on of it; when Marian replied, that it would be too expen&s;ive for their father to think of finding &s;hoes and &s;tockings for them all, and therefore none of them had any; but they found no inconveniency from it, &s;ince time had &s;o hardened the bottom of their feet, as to make &s;hoes unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The time having &s;lipped away in this kind of chit-chat, Marian told Mi&s;s Bella that &s;he mu&s;t be going, in order to gather &s;ome greens for her cow, who would want her breakfa&s;t by eight o'clock. This little girl did not eat up all her roll and jelly, but &s;aved &s;ome part of it to carry home to her younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter, who, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he was &s;ure would be very fond of it. Bella was va&s;tly plea&s;ed to find Marian was &s;o tender of her &s;i&s;ter, and de&s;ired &s;he would not fail to come again at the &s;ame hour the next morning. So after a mutual good-bye, they &s;eparated for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bella had now, for the fir&s;t time, ta&s;ted the plea&s;ure of doing good. She
<PB N="65" REF="047362_0070_1022CD9A811B9D78">
walked a little longer in the garden, enjoy|ing the plea&s;ing reflection how happy &s;he had made Marian, how grateful that little girl had &s;hewed her&s;elf, and how plea&s;ed her &s;i&s;ter would be to ta&s;te currant-jelly, which &s;he had never even &s;een before.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bella was enjoying the idea of the plea&s;ure &s;he &s;hould receive from her future bounties to her new acquaintance, when &s;he recollected, that &s;he had &s;ome ribbands and a necklace, which her mamma had given her a little time before, but of which &s;he now began to grow tired. Be&s;ides the&s;e, &s;he had &s;ome other old things to give her, which, though of no u&s;e to her&s;elf, would make Marian quite fine.</P>
<P>The next morning Marian came into the garden again, and Mi&s;s Bella was ready to receive her, with a tolerable good portion of gingerbread. Indeed, this interview was continued every morning, and Mi&s;s Bella always carried &s;ome dainties along with her. When her pocked failed her, &s;he would beg her mamma to &s;upply her with &s;omething out of the pantry, which was always chearfully complied with.</P>
<P>One day, however, it happened, that Bella received an an&s;wer which gave her
<PB N="66" REF="047362_0071_1022CE91588E8B78">
&s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s. She had been begging her mamma to advance her &s;omething on her weekly allowance, in order to buy &s;hoes and &s;tockings for Marian; to which her mamma gave her a flat denial, telling her, that &s;he wi&s;hed &s;he would be a little more &s;paring to her favourite, for which &s;he would give her a rea&s;on at dinner-time.&mdash; Bella was a little &s;urprized at this an&s;wer, and every hour appeared and age till din|ner-time arrived.</P>
<P>At length they &s;at down to table, and dinner was half over before her mamma &s;aid a word about Marian; but a di&s;h of &s;hrimps being then &s;erved up, gave her mamma an opportunity of beginning the conver&s;ation. "I think, Bella, (&s;aid the lady this is your favourite di&s;h." Bella replied it was, and could not help ob&s;erv+ing, how happy &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed poor Marian would be to ta&s;te them, who, &s;he imagined, had never &s;o much as &s;een any. With her mamma's leave, &s;he begged two of the &s;malle&s;t, to give to that little girl.</P>
<P>Mrs. Adams, for &s;uch was her mamma's name, &s;eemed unwilling to grant her re|que&s;t, urging, that &s;he was afraid &s;he would do her favourite more mi&s;chief than good. "At pre&s;ent, (&s;aid her mamma) &s;he eats
<PB N="67" REF="047362_0072_1022599319952220">
her dry brown bread with an appetite, and walks barfooted on the gravel without com|plaining. Should you continue to feed her with dainties, and accu&s;tom her to wear &s;hoes and &s;tockings, what would &s;he do, &s;hould &s;he by any means lo&s;e your fa|vour, and with it all tho&s;e indulgencies? She would then lament that &s;he had ever experienced your bounty.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bella ha&s;tily replied, that &s;he meant to be a friend to her all her life, and only wi&s;hed that her mamma, in order to enable her to do &s;o, would add a little to her week|ly allowance, and &s;he would manage it with all the frugality po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Mrs. Adams then a&s;ked her daughter, if &s;he did not know of any other children in di&s;tre&s;s; to which Bella replied, that &s;he knew &s;everal be&s;ides, and particularly two in a neighbouring village, who had neither father nor mother, and who, without doubt, &s;tood much in need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Her mamma then reminded her, that it was &s;omewhat uncharitable to feed Marian with &s;weetmeats and dainties, while other poor children were &s;tarving with hunger. To this Bella replied, that &s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould have &s;omething to &s;pare for them likewi&s;e; but, at all events, &s;he loved Marian be&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="047362_0073_102259A2822529F0">However, her mamma advi&s;ed her, to give her &s;weet things &s;eldomer, and in&s;tead thereof &s;omething that would be of more u&s;e to her, &s;uch as an apion or a gown. Mi&s;s Bella immediately propo&s;ed to give her one of her frocks; but her mamma &s;oon made her &s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of dre&s;&s;ing up a village girl, without &s;hoes or &s;tockings, in a mu&s;lin &s;lip. "Were I in your place, (&s;aid her mamma) I would be &s;paring in my amu&s;ements for &s;ome time, and when I had &s;aved a little money, I would lay it out in buying whatever was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for her. The &s;tuffs that poor children wear are not very expen&s;ive." Bella followed her mamma's advice. Ma|rian was not, indeed, &s;o punctual in her morning vi&s;its, but Bella made her pre|&s;ents that were far more u&s;eful than &s;weet|meats.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bella, be&s;ides frequently giving Marian an apron, a petticoat, or &s;uch like, paid a certain &s;um every month to the &s;choolma&s;ter of the village to improve her in reading. Marian was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e kindne&s;&s;es, that &s;he grew every day more tenderly fond of her kind benefac|tre&s;s. She frequently paid her a vi&s;it, and
<PB N="69" REF="047362_0074_102259EDD9114C20">
was never &s;o happy as when &s;he could do any little matters to oblige her.</P>
<P>Marian came one day to the garden-gate to wait for Bella's coming down to her; but &s;he did not come, and &s;he was obliged to go back again without &s;eeing her. She returned two days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, but no Bella appeared, which was a great affliction to her little heart, and &s;he began to fear &s;he had inadvertently offended her. "I have per|haps&punc; (&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf) done &s;omething to vex her: I am &s;ure, if I knew I had, I would a&s;k her a thou&s;and pardons, for I cannot live with loving her."</P>
<P>While &s;he was thus reflecting, one of Mrs. Adams's maids came out of the hou&s;e, when poor Marian &s;topped her, and a&s;ked her where Mi&s;s Bella was. "Mi&s;s Bella! replied the woman &s;he is ill of the &s;mall-pox, &s;o ill, indeed, that there are no hopes of her recovery!" Poor Marian was all di&s;traction, and without con&s;idering what &s;he did, flew up &s;tairs, and bur&s;t into Mrs. Adams's room, imploring on her knees, that &s;he might be permitted to &s;ee her dear Mi&s;s Bella.</P>
<P>Mrs. Adams would have &s;topped Mari|an; but the door being half open, &s;he flew to her bed&s;ide like an arrow out of a bow&punc;
<PB N="70" REF="047362_0075_1022CD9D33069388">
Poor Bella was in a violent fever, alone, and very low &s;pirited; for all her little companions had for&s;aken her. Marian, drowned in tears, &s;eized hold of Bella's hand, &s;queezed it in hers, and ki&s;&s;ed it. "Ah! my dear Mi&s;s, (&s;aid &s;he) is it in this condition I find you! But you mu&s;t not die; what would then become of me? I will watch over you and &s;erve you! &s;hall I, my dear Mi&s;s Bella?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bella, &s;queezing Marian's hand, &s;ignified to her, that &s;taying with her would do her a great favour. And the little maid, with Mrs. Adams's con&s;ent, became Bella's nur&s;e, which &s;he performed the part of to admiration. She had a &s;mall bed made up for her, clo&s;e be&s;ide her little &s;ick friend, whom &s;he never left for a moment. If the &s;lighte&s;t &s;igh e&s;caped Bella, Marian was up in an in&s;tant to know what &s;he wanted, and gave her, with her own hands, all her me|dicines.</P>
<P>This grateful girl did every thing &s;he could to amu&s;e her friend. She ran&s;acked Mrs. Adams's library for books that had pictures in them, which &s;he would &s;hew to Bella; and during that time that her eyes were darkened by her di&s;order, which was for near a week, Marian exerted her&s;elf to
<PB N="71" REF="047362_0076_1022CD9EB70C4518">
the utmo&s;t to divert her. When Bella grew impatient at the want of &s;ight, Marian told her &s;tories of what happened in the village; and, as &s;he had made a good u&s;e of her &s;chool-ma&s;ter's in&s;tructions, &s;he read what|ever &s;he thought would be amu&s;ing and di|verting to her.</P>
<P>Thus Marian was not only her nur&s;e, but philo&s;opher al&s;o; for &s;he would &s;ometimes &s;ay to her, "God Almighty will have pity upon you, as you have had pity on me.&mdash; Will your let me &s;ing a pretty &s;ong to divert you?" Bella had only to make a &s;ign, and the little maid would &s;ing her every &s;ong &s;he had learned from the village nymphs and &s;wains, endeavouring by this means to &s;often the affliction of her generous friend.</P>
<P>At length, &s;he began to open her eyes, her lowne&s;s of &s;pirits left her, the pock dried up, and her appetite returned. Her face was &s;till covered with red &s;pots; but Marian looked at her with more plea&s;ure than ever, from the con&s;ideration of the danger &s;he had been in of loo&s;ing her; while the grateful Bella, on the other hand, re|garded her with equal tenderne&s;s. "In what manner, (&s;he would &s;ometimes &s;ay) can I think of requiting you, to my own
<PB N="72" REF="047362_0077_1022CDA2C451BE50">
&s;atisfaction, for the tender care you have taken of me?"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bella, as &s;oon as &s;he found her&s;elf perfectly recovered, a&s;ked her mamma in what manner &s;he &s;hould recompen&s;e her faithful and tender nur&s;e; but Mrs. Adams, who&s;e joy on the recovery of her daughter was inexpre&s;&s;ible, de&s;ired Bella to leave that matter to her, as &s;he likewi&s;e was equally in her debt.</P>
<P>Mrs. Adams gave private orders to have a complete &s;uit of clothes made for Marian, and Bella de&s;ired that &s;he might have the plea&s;ure of dre&s;&s;ing her the fir&s;t time &s;he was permitted to go into the garden. The day arrived, and it was indeed a day of re|joicing throughout the whole family; for Bella was beloved by all the &s;ervants, as well as by all her acquaintance.</P>
<P>This was a joyful day to Mi&s;s Bella, who had the double &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing her health re&s;tored, and of beholding her little friend dre&s;&s;ed out in her new clothes. It is much ea&s;ier to conceive than to expre&s;s the emotions of the&s;e two tender hearts, when they again found them&s;elves in the garden, on that very &s;pot where their acquaintance fir&s;t commenced. They tenderly embraced
<PB N="73" REF="047362_0078_1022CDA579089DD0">
each other, and vowed an in&s;eparable friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>It is evidently clear, from the &s;tory of Bella and Marian, how advantageous it is to be generous and humane. Had not Bella by her kindne&s;s attached Marian to her intere&s;t, &s;he might have &s;unk under the &s;evere indi&s;po&s;ition; from which the kind attentions, and the unremitting a&s;&s;iduities of Marian, were perhaps the chief means of re&s;toring her.</P>

<P>ONE day, as Mr. Glover was returning home, after taking a ride over his e&s;tates, and pa&s;&s;ing by the wall of a bury|ing-ground belonging to a &s;mall village, he heard the &s;ound of groans and lamentations.</P>
<P>As he had a heart that was ever open to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others, he alighted from his hor&s;e to &s;ee from whence the voice pro|ceeded, and got over the enclo&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="047362_0080_1022CDAAE23B32E8">On his entering the place, he perceived a grave fre&s;h filled up, upon which, at full length, lay a child about five years old, who was crying &s;adly. Mr. Glover went up to him, and tenderly a&s;ked him what he did there. "I am calling my mother, (&s;aid he) they laid her here ye&s;terday, and &s;he does not get up."</P>
<P>Mr. Glover then told him, that his poor mother was dead, and would get up no more. "I know, (replied the poor child) that they tell me &s;he is dead, but I do not believe it. She was perfectly well when &s;he left me the other day with old Su&s;an our neighbour; &s;he told me &s;he would &s;oon come back, but &s;he has not kept her word. My father is gone away too, and al&s;o my little brother; and the other boys of the village will not play with me, but &s;ay very naughty things about my father and mother, which vexes me more than all. O mammy, get up, get up!"</P>
<P>Mr. Glover's eyes were filled with tears: he a&s;ked him where his father and brother were gone to. He replied, that he did not know where his father was; and as to his little brother, he was the day before taken to another town, by a per&s;on dre&s;&s;ed in black, ju&s;t like their par&s;on. Mr. Glover
<PB N="76" REF="047362_0081_1022CDAC69992B80">
then a&s;ked him where he lived. "With our neighbour Su&s;an, (&s;aid he) I am to be there till my mother comes back, as &s;he promi&s;ed me. I love my other mammy Su&s;an very well! but I love my mammy that lies here a great deal better. O mo|ther! mother! why do you lie &s;o long? when will you get up?"</P>
<P>"My poor child, (&s;aid Mr. Glover) it is in vain to call her, for &s;he will awake no more!"&mdash;"Then, (&s;aid the poor little boy) I will lie down here, and &s;leep by her. Ah! I &s;aw her when they put her into a great che&s;t to carry her away. Oh, how white &s;he was! and how cold! I will lie down here and &s;leep by her!"</P>
<P>The tears now &s;tarted from the eyes of Mr. Glover, for he could no longer con|ceal them, but &s;tooping down, took the child up in his arms, and tenderly ki&s;&s;ed him, a&s;king him what was his name.&mdash; "When I am a good boy, they call me Jackey, and when I behave ami&s;s, they &s;ay, you Jack." Mr. Glover, though in tears, could not help &s;miling at the inno|cence and &s;implicity of this an&s;wer, and begged Jackey to conduct him to the hou&s;e of the good Su&s;an.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="047362_0082_1022CDB06EC242B8">The child very readily con&s;ented, and running before him as fa&s;t as his legs would carry him, conducted Mr. Glover to Su&s;an's door. Su&s;an was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed, on &s;eeing Jack conduct a gentleman into her cottage, and then running to her, hid his little head in her lap, crying, "This is &s;he! this is my other mammy!" Mr. Glover, however, did not keep her long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, but related to her what he had ju&s;t &s;een, and begged Su&s;an to give him the hi&s;tory of the parents of this little boy. Su&s;an de&s;ired the gentleman to be &s;eated, and then related to him the following particulars:</P>
<P>"The father of this poor child is a &s;hoe|maker, and his hou&s;e is next to mine.

<PB N="78" REF="047362_0083_1022CDB327A1A528">
With this they bought the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary articles of hou&s;hold furniture, and a &s;mall &s;tock of leather to begin bu&s;ine&s;s with.&mdash; However, by dint of labour and good ma|nagement, they for &s;ome years contrived to live a little comfortably.</P>
<P>"As children encrea&s;ed, &s;o did their difficulties, and misfortunes &s;eldom come alone. Poor Margaret, who had daily worked in the fields during hay-time, to bring home a little money to her hu&s;band at night, fell ill, and continued &s;o all the har|ve&s;t and winter. John's cu&s;tomers left him one after another, fearing that work could not go on properly in a &s;ick hou&s;e.</P>
<P>"Though Margaret at la&s;t grew better, yet her hu&s;band's work continued to decline, and he was obliged to borrow money to pay the apothecary; while poor Margaret con|tinued &s;o weakly that nobody thought it worth their while to employ her. The rent of their hou&s;e, and the intere&s;t of the mo|ney they had borrowed, were heavy loads upon them; and they were frequently obliged to endure hunger them&s;elves, in or|der to give a mor&s;el of bread to their poor children.</P>
<P>"To add to their misfortunes, their hard-hearted landlord threatened to put poor
<PB N="79" REF="047362_0084_1022CDB4AC575D38">
John in jail, if he did not pay the two quarters rent that were due; and, though he is the riche&s;t man in the place, it was with the greate&s;t difficulty that they could obtain a month's delay. He declared, if they did not at the end of that time pay the whole, he would &s;ell their furniture, and put John in pri&s;on. Their hou&s;e was now a picture of melancholy and patient di&s;tre&s;s. How often have I lamented my inability to a&s;&s;i&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of this hone&s;t couple!</P>
<P>"I went my&s;elf to their landlord, and begged of him, for God's &s;ake, to have &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion on the&s;e unfortunate peo|ple, and even offered to pawn to him all I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in the world; but he treat|ed me with contempt, and told me I was as bad as they were. I was obliged, however, being only a poor widow, to bear the in&s;ult with patience, and contented my&s;elf by ea&s;ing my heart with a flood of tears.</P>
<P>"I advi&s;ed poor Margaret to make her di&s;tre&s;&s;es known to the worthy clergyman, with whom &s;he had &s;o long lived with an unblemi&s;hed character, and to beg of him to advance them a little money. Margaret replied, that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed her hu&s;band would not like that propo&s;al, fearing that
<PB N="80" REF="047362_0085_1022CDB796D703F0">
their friends might &s;u&s;pect their nece&s;&s;ities proceeded from mi&s;management.</P>
<P>"It is but a few days ago &s;ince &s;he brought me her two children, and begged me to take care of them till the evening. Her inten|tion was to go to a village at a little di&s;tance, and endeavour to get &s;ome hemp from the weaver to &s;pin, with a view to get &s;ome|thing towards the debt. As &s;he could not per&s;uade her&s;elf to wait upon the clergy|man, her hu&s;band had undertaken it, and had accordingly &s;et off on that bu&s;ine&s;s. As Margaret was going, &s;he cla&s;ped her two children to her brea&s;t and ki&s;&s;ed them, little thinking it was to be the la&s;t time &s;he &s;hould ever &s;ee them.</P>
<P>"Soon after &s;he was gone, I heard &s;ome noi&s;e in her hou&s;e, but &s;uppo&s;ed it might be only tht flapping of the door. However, the evening came on, and my neighbour did not come to fetch her children as u&s;ual. I therefore determined to go to her hou&s;e, and &s;ee if &s;he was come home. I found the door open, and went in; but how &s;hall I expre&s;s my horror and a&s;toni&s;hment, when I found poor Margaret lying dead at the foot of the &s;tairs!</P>
<P>"After trying in vain to recover her, I fetched the &s;urgeon, who &s;hook his head,
<PB N="81" REF="047362_0086_1022CDBBA3DF6920">
and &s;aid all was over. The coroner's in|que&s;t brought in their verdict Accidental Death; but, as her hu&s;band was mi&s;&s;ing, ill-natured people rai&s;ed &s;u&s;picious reports. Her death, however, was ea&s;ily to be ac|counted for: &s;he had returned to her hou&s;e, to go up to the loft for a bag to hold her hemp, and, as her eyes were &s;till dimmed with tears, &s;he had mi&s;&s;ed her &s;tep in com|ing down, and fallen from the top of the &s;tairs, with her head foremo&s;t, on the ground. The bag that laid by her &s;ide &s;hewed this to have been the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>"I made an offer to the pari&s;h officers to keep the two children my&s;elf, not doubting, but that the goodne&s;s of God, even a poor widow as I was, would enable me to &s;up|port them. The worthy curate came ye&s;|terday to &s;ee the unfortunate Margaret, and great indeed was his affliction, when I related to him what I have been now telling you. I then told him, that John was gone to him; but I was much &s;urpri&s;ed, when he declared he had &s;een nothing of him. The two children came up to him, and little Jack a&s;ked him, if he could not awake his mother, who had been a long time a&s;leep. This brought tears into the eyes of the good curate, who propo&s;ed to take the two
<PB N="82" REF="047362_0087_1022CDBE51504BF8">
children home to his own hou&s;e, and bring them up under his care; but, as I could not con&s;ent to part with both the&s;e inno|cents, it was at la&s;t agreed, that he &s;hould take the younger, and leave me the elder.</P>
<P>"He a&s;ked little Jack, if he &s;hould not like to go with him. "What, where my mother is? (&s;aid Jack) oh! yes, with all my heart!&mdash;"No, my little man, (replied the curate) I do not mean there, but to my hand&s;ome hou&s;e and garden."&mdash;"No, no, (an&s;wered Jack) I will &s;tay here with Su&s;an, and every day go where my mother is; for I would rather go there than to your hand|&s;ome garden."</P>
<P>"This worthy curate did not chu&s;e to vex the child more, but went and hid him|&s;elf behind my bed curtains. He told me he would &s;end his man for the younger, who would be more trouble to me than the elder child, and before he went, left me &s;ome money towards the &s;upport of this.</P>
<P>"This, Sir, is the whole of this unfortu|nate bu&s;ine&s;s. What makes me exceedingly unea&s;y at pre&s;ent is, that John does not return, and that it is reported in the pari&s;h, that he has connected him&s;elf with a gang of &s;mug|glers, and that his wife put an end to her life through grief. The&s;e &s;tories have ob|tained
<PB N="83" REF="047362_0088_1022CDBFD5D58DC8">
&s;uch credit in the village, that even the children have got it; and whenever poor Jack attempts to mix with them, they drive him away as though he were infectious. Hence the poor little fellow is quite dull, and now never goes out but to pay a &s;ad vi|&s;it to his mother's grave."</P>
<P>Mr. Glover, who had &s;ilently li&s;tened to this melancholy tale, was deeply affected by it. Little Jack was now got clo&s;e up to Su&s;an, he looked at her with fondne&s;s, and often called her his mother. Mr. Glover at length broke &s;ilence, and told Su&s;an &s;he was a worthy woman, and that God would not fail to reward her for her genero&s;ity to|ward this unfortunate family.</P>
<P>"Ah!" (&s;aid Su&s;an) I am happy in what I have done, and I wi&s;h I could have done more; but my only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion con&s;i&s;ts in my cottage, a little garden in which I have a few greens, and what I can earn by the labour of my hands. Yet for the&s;e eight years that I have been a widow, God has not &s;uffered me to want, and I tru&s;t he ne|ver will."</P>
<P>Mr. Glover reminded her, that keeping this little boy mu&s;t be vey inconvenient to her, and that &s;he would find it difficult to &s;upply him with clothes. She an&s;wered,
<PB N="84" REF="047362_0089_1022CDC3B38DD488">
"I leave the care of that to him, who clothes the field with gra&s;s, and the trees with leaves. He has given me fingers to &s;ow and &s;pin, and they &s;hall work to clothe my poor little orphan. I will never part with him."</P>
<P>Mr. Glover was a&s;toni&s;hed at this good woman's re&s;olution. "I mu&s;t not &s;uffer you alone (&s;aid he) to have all the honour of befriending this poor orphan, &s;ince God has be&s;towed on me tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings of afflu|ence which you do not enjoy. Permit me to take care of the education of this &s;weet boy; and, &s;ince I find you cannot live &s;e|parate, I will take you both home with me, and provide for you. Sell your cottage and garden, and make my hou&s;e your own, where you may &s;pend the remainder of your life amid&s;t peace and plenty."</P>
<P>Su&s;an gave Mr. Glover a mo&s;t affection|ate look, but begged he would excu&s;e her accepting his offer, as &s;he was fond of the &s;pot on which &s;he was born, and had lived in &s;o long. Be&s;ides, &s;he added, &s;he could not &s;uit her&s;elf to the bu&s;tle of a great hou&s;e, and &s;hould &s;oon grow &s;ick, were &s;he to live upon dainties in idlene&s;s. "If you will plea&s;e (continued Su&s;an) now and then to &s;end him a &s;mall matter to pay for his
<PB N="85" REF="047362_0090_1022CDC6841067C0">
&s;chooling, and to &s;upply him with tools when he &s;hall take to bu&s;ine&s;s, God will not fail to reward you for your bounty. As I have no child, he &s;hall be as one to me, and whatever I po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;hall be his at my death."</P>
<P>Mr. Glover finding &s;he did not chu&s;e to quit her habitation, told her, he &s;hould every month &s;end her what would be &s;uffi|cient for her &s;upport, and that he would &s;ometimes come and &s;ee them him&s;elf. Su|&s;an lifted up her hands to heaven, and bid Jackey go and a&s;k the gentleman's ble&s;&s;ing, which he did. He then threw down his pur&s;e on the table, bid them a farewell, and mounting his hor&s;e, took the road that led to the pari&s;h, in which the worthy curate lived.</P>
<P>On Mr. Glover's arrival there, he found the worthy curate reading a letter, on which he had &s;hed &s;ome tears. He explained the cau&s;e of his vi&s;it to this worthy divine, and a&s;ked him, if he knew what was become of the father of the two little unfortunate children. The curate replied, that it was not a quarter of an hour &s;ince he received a letter from him to his wife. "It was (&s;aid the curate) inclo&s;ed in one to me, and
<PB N="86" REF="047362_0091_1022CDC930841310">
contains a &s;mall draft for the u&s;e of his wife; he reque&s;ts me to deliver it to her, and to con&s;ole her for his ab&s;ence. As &s;he is dead, I have opened the letter, and here it is: he &s;o kind as to read it. Mr. Glover took the letter, the particulars of which were as follow:</P>
<P>He hoped his wife would not give her|&s;elf any unea&s;ine&s;s on account of his ab|&s;ence. As he was going to the clergyman's hou&s;e, he began to think, that it could be of no u&s;e to go thus a begging, and, if he &s;hould borrow money, he was not &s;ure he &s;hould be able to pay it, which he thought would be as bad as thieving. At this in|&s;tant a thought &s;truck into his head, that he was young and hearty, &s;tout and able-bodied, and therefore could &s;ee no harm if he entered on board a man of war for a few years, where he might &s;tand a chance of getting a fortune for his wife and children, at lea&s;t get enough to pay all his debts.&mdash; While he was thinking of this matter, a pre&s;s-gang came up, and a&s;ked him if he would enter, telling him that they would give him five pounds bounty. The thought of receiving five pounds, fixed his deter|mination at once, and he accordingly enter|ed, received the money, and &s;ent every
<PB N="87" REF="047362_0092_1022CDCAB55A7280">
thing of it to his wife, with his love and ble&s;&s;ing, and hoping they would all join in their prayers to God for him. He hoped the war would &s;oon be over, and then he &s;hould return with inexpre&s;&s;ible joy to his dear wife.</P>
<P>Mr. Glover's eyes &s;wimmed with tears all the time he was reading the letter. When he had fini&s;hed it, "this man (&s;aid he) may indeed ju&s;tly be called a good hu&s;band, a tender father, and an hone&s;t man. There is an expre&s;&s;ive plea&s;ure in being a friend to &s;uch characters as the&s;e. I will pay John's debts, and enable him to take up his trade again. Let his money be kept for the children, to be divided between them, as &s;oon as they &s;hall be at an age to know how to make u&s;e of it, and I will add &s;omething to this &s;acred depo&s;it."</P>
<P>So greatly was the worthy curate affect|ed, that he could make no reply; and Mr. Glover perfectly under&s;tanding the cau&s;e of his &s;ilence, &s;queezed him by the hand, and took his leave; but he completely accom|pli&s;hed all his de&s;igns in favour of John, who at length returned, and enjoyed an ea|&s;ine&s;s of circum&s;tances beyond any thing he had before experienced.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="047362_0093_1022CDCD69603190">Nothing now di&s;turbed John's felicity, but the &s;orrowful reflection of having lo&s;t his dear Margaret; &s;he had experienced part of his misfortunes, but had not lived to &s;hare in his felicity; and John's only con&s;olation is perpetually to talk about her to Su&s;an, whom he looks upon as a &s;i&s;ter to him, and as a mother to his children. Little Jack frequently vi&s;its his mother's grave; and has made &s;o good a u&s;e of Mr. Glover's genero&s;ity, in improving him&s;elf, that this excellent gentleman intends placing him in a very de&s;irable &s;ituation.

<P>My readers will from hence learn, that God always a&s;&s;i&s;ts tho&s;e who put their tru&s;t in him. It is on him we mu&s;t rely on every occa&s;ion, and he will not de&s;ert us, provi|ded we our&s;elves al&s;o try to &s;urmount diffi|culties by patience and indu&s;try.</P>

</FIGURE> LEONORA AND ADOLPHUS.</HEAD>
<P>A Young widow lady, who&s;e name was Lenox, had two children, Leonora and Adolphus, both equally de&s;erving the affections of a parent, which, however, were unequally &s;hared. Adolphus was the favourite, which Leonora very early began to di&s;cover, and con&s;equently felt no &s;mall &s;hare of unea&s;ine&s;s on the occa&s;ion; but
<PB N="90" REF="047362_0095_1022CDD42580D480">
&s;he was prudent enough to conceal her &s;or|row.</P>
<P>Leonora, though not remarkably hand|&s;ome, had a mind that made ample amends for the want of beauty; but her brother was a little Cupid, on whom Mrs. Lenox lavi&s;hed all her ki&s;&s;es and care&s;&s;es. It is no wonder that the &s;ervants, to gain the favour of their mi&s;tre&s;s, were very attentive to humour him in all his whim&s;ies. Leonora, on the other hand, was con&s;equently &s;light|ed by every one in the hou&s;e; and, &s;o far from wi&s;hing to &s;tudy her humour, they &s;carcely treated her with common civility.</P>
<P>Finding her&s;elf frequently alone and neglected, and taken little notice of by any one, &s;he would privately &s;hed a torrent of tears; but &s;he always took care, that not the lea&s;t mark of di&s;content &s;hould e&s;cape her in the pre&s;ence of any one. Her con|&s;tant attention to the ob&s;ervance of her duty, her mildne&s;s, and endeavours to convince her mother, that her mind was &s;uperior to her face, had no effect; for beauty alone attracts the attention of tho&s;e, who examine no further than external appearances.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lenox, who was continually chi|ding Leonora, and expecting from her per|fections far beyond the reach of tho&s;e more
<PB N="91" REF="047362_0096_1022CDD5A952BC40">
advanced in years, at la&s;t fell &s;ick. Adol|phus &s;eemed very &s;orry for his mother's ill|ne&s;s; for Leonora, with the &s;ofte&s;t looks and mo&s;t langui&s;hing countenance, fancied &s;he perceived in her mother an abatement of her accu&s;tomed rigour towards her, and far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed her brother in her attention to her parent. She endeavoured to &s;upply her &s;lighted wants, exerted all her penetra|tion to di&s;cover them, that &s;he might even &s;pare her the pain of a&s;king for any thing. So long as her mother's illne&s;s had the lea&s;t appearance of danger, &s;he never quitted her pillow, and neither threats nor com|mands could prevail on her to take the lea&s;t repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lenox, however, at length recover|ed, which afforded inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure to the amiable Leonora; but &s;he &s;oon experi|enced a renewal of her misfortunes, as her mother began to treat her with her u&s;ual &s;e|verity and indifference.</P>
<P>As Mrs. Lenox was one day talking to her children on the pain &s;he had &s;uffered during her illne&s;s, and was prai&s;ing them for the anxiety they had &s;hewn on her ac|count, &s;he de&s;ired them to a&s;k of her what|ever they thought would be the mo&s;t plea&s;|ing to them, and they &s;hould certainly be
<PB N="92" REF="047362_0097_1022CDD8609B2718">
indulged in it, provided their demands were not unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Adolphus, &s;he de&s;ired to know what he would choo&s;e; and his de&s;ire was to have a cane and a watch, which his mother promi&s;ed he &s;hould have the next morning. "And pray, Leonora, (&s;aid Mrs. Lenox) what is your wi&s;h?&mdash;"Me, mamma, me? (an|&s;wered &s;he, trembling) if you do but love me, I have nothing el&s;e to wi&s;h for!"&mdash; "That is not an an&s;wer; (replied her mo|ther) you &s;hall have your recompence like|wi&s;e, mi&s;s; therefore &s;peak your wi&s;h in|&s;tantly."</P>
<P>However accu&s;tomed Leonora might have been to this &s;evere tone, yet &s;he felt it on this occa&s;ion more &s;en&s;ibly than ever &s;he had before. She threw her&s;elf at her mother's feet, looked up to her with eyes &s;wimming in tears, and in&s;tantly hiding her face with both her hands, li&s;ped out the&s;e words: "Only give me two ki&s;&s;es, &s;uch as you give my brother."</P>
<P>What heart could fail to relent at the&s;e words? Mrs. Lenox felt all the tender &s;en|timents of a parent ari&s;e in her heart, and taking her up in her arms, &s;he cla&s;ped her
<PB N="93" REF="047362_0098_1022CDDB10C9DDE8">
to her brea&s;t, and loaded her with ki&s;&s;es. The &s;weet Leonora, who now, for the fir&s;t time received her mother's care&s;&s;es, gave way to the effu&s;ion of her joy and love; &s;he ki&s;&s;ed her cheeks, her eyes, her brea&s;ts, and her hands; and Adolphus, who loved his &s;i&s;ter, mixed his embraces with hers. Thus all had a &s;hare in this &s;cene of unexpected happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The affection, which Mrs. Lenox had &s;o long withheld from Leonora, &s;he now repaid with intere&s;t, and her daughter re|turned it with the mo&s;t dutiful attention. Adolphus, &s;o far from being jealous at this change of his mother's affection for his &s;i&s;ter, &s;hewed every mark of plea&s;ure on the occa&s;ion, and he afterwards reaped a reward of &s;o generous a conduct; for his natural di&s;po&s;ition having been, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, injured by the too great indul|gence of his mother, he gave way in his early days to tho&s;e little indi&s;cretions, which would have lo&s;t him the heart of his parent, had not his &s;i&s;ter &s;tepped in between them. It was to the advice of this amiable girl that Adolphus at la&s;t owed his entire refor|mation of manners. They all three then experienced, that true happine&s;s cannot ex|i&s;t in a family, unle&s;s the mo&s;t perfect union

<P>As &s;oon as he came oppo&s;ite to the place where little Flora was &s;itting, he threw down to her a lamb, which he was carrying acro&s;s his &s;houlder, &s;aying, "There, my girl, is a poor &s;orry creature that has ju&s;t died, and made me &s;ome &s;hillings poorer than I was. You may take it, if you will, and do what you like with it."</P>
<P>Flora put down her milk and bread, and taking up the lamb, viewed it with looks of tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion. "But why &s;hould I pity you? (&s;aid &s;he to the lamb). Either this day or to-morrow they would have run a great knife through your throat, whereas now you have nothing to fear."</P>
<P>While &s;he was thus &s;peaking, the warmth of her arms &s;omewhat revived the lamb, who opening its eyes a little, made a &s;light motion, and cried baa in a very low tone, as if it were calling for its mother. It would be impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s little Flora's joy on
<PB N="97" REF="047362_0102_1022CDE735B9B920">
this occa&s;ion. She covered the lamb in her apron, and over that put her &s;tuff petticoat; &s;he then bent her brea&s;t down towards her lap, in order to encrea&s;e the warmth, and blew into its mouth and no&s;trils with all the force &s;he could. By degrees, the poor animal began to &s;tir, and every motion it made conveyed joy to her little heart.</P>
<P>This &s;ucce&s;s encouraged her to proceed: &s;he crumbled &s;ome of her bread into her pan, and taking it up in her fingers, &s;he with no &s;mall difficulty forced it between its teeth, which were very firmly clo&s;ed toge|ther. The lamb, who&s;e only di&s;order was hunger and fatigue, began to feel the effects of this nouri&s;hment. It fir&s;t began to &s;tretch out its limbs, then to &s;hake its head, to wag its tail, and at la&s;t to prick up its ears. In a little time, it was able to &s;tand upon its legs, and then went of it&s;elf to Flora's break|fa&s;t pan, who was highly delighted to &s;ee it take &s;uch plea&s;ing liberties; for &s;he cared not a farthing about lo&s;ing her own breakfa&s;t, &s;ince it &s;aved the life of the little lamb. In &s;hort, in a little time it recovered its u&s;ual &s;trength, and began to &s;kip and play about her kind deliverer.</P>
<P>It may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed, that Flora was greatly plea&s;ed at this unexpected &s;uc|ce&s;s.
<PB N="98" REF="047362_0103_1022CDE9EC4ACE60">
She took it up in her arms, and ran with it to the cottage to &s;hew it to her mother. Her Baba, for &s;o Flora called it, became the fir&s;t object of her cares, and it con&s;tantly &s;hared with her in the little allowance of bread and milk, which &s;he received for her meals. Indeed, &s;o fond was &s;he of it, that &s;he would not have exchanged it for a whole flock. Nor was Baba in&s;en&s;ible of the fondne&s;s of her little mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ince &s;he would follow her wherever &s;he went, would come and eat out of her hand, &s;kip and fri&s;k round her, and would bleat mo&s;t pitiou&s;ly, when Flora was obliged to leave her at home.</P>
<P>Baba, however, repaid the &s;ervices of her little mi&s;tre&s;s in a more &s;ub&s;tantial man|ner, than that of merely dancing about her; for &s;he brought forth young lambs, tho&s;e lambs grew up, and brought forth others; &s;o that, within the &s;pace of a few years, Flora had a very capital flock, that furni&s;h|ed the whole family with food and raiment. Such, my little readers, are the rewards which Providence be&s;tows on acts of good|ne&s;s, tenderne&s;s, and humanity.</P>

</FIGURE> THE FRUITFUL VINE.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in the beginning of the &s;pring, when Mr. Jack&s;on went to his country hou&s;e, and took with him his little &s;on Ju|nius, in order to treat him with a walk in the garden. The primro&s;es and violets were then di&s;playing all their beauties, and many trees had begun to &s;hew what livery they were &s;oon to wear.</P>
<P>After walking &s;ome time about the gar|den, they happened to go into the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, at the foot of which grew the &s;tump
<PB N="100" REF="047362_0105_1022CDEE1F759E90">
of a vine, which twi&s;ted wildly, and extend|ed its naked branches in a rude and irregu|lar manner. As &s;oon as little Junius &s;aw this tree, he exclaimed &s;adly again&s;t the ugly apperance it made, and began to ex|ert all his &s;trength to pull it up, but he found his efforts in vain, it being too well rooted to yield to his weak arm. He beg|ged his papa to call the gardener to grub it up, and make fire-wood of it; but Mr. Jack&s;on de&s;ired his &s;on to let the tree a|lone, telling him that he would, in a few months, give him his rea&s;ons for not com|plying with his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>This did not &s;atisfy Junius, who de&s;ired his father to look at tho&s;e lively crocu&s;&s;es and &s;now-drops, &s;aying, he could not &s;ee why that barran &s;tump &s;hould be kept, which did not produce a &s;ingle green leaf. He thought it &s;poiled and disfigured the garden, and therefore begged his father would permit him to fetch the gardener to pluck it up.</P>
<P>Mr. Jack&s;on, who could not think of granting him his reque&s;t, told him, that it mu&s;t &s;tand as it then was, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time to come. Little Junius &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his entreaties, urging how di&s;graceful it was to the garden; but his father diverted
<PB N="101" REF="047362_0106_1022CDF205551108">
his attention from the vine, by turning the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>It &s;o happened, that Mr. Jack&s;on's af|fairs called him to a different part of the country, from whence he did not return till the middle of autumn. He no &s;ooner came home, than he paid a vi&s;it to his country hou&s;e, taking little Junius with him. As the day happened to be exceedingly warm, they retired to enjoy the benefit of the &s;hade, and entered the arbour, in which &s;he vine &s;tump had before &s;o much offend|ed his &s;on Junius.</P>
<P>"Ah! papa, (&s;aid the young gentleman) how charming and delightful is this green &s;hade! I am much obliged to you for hav|ing that dry and ugly &s;tump plucked up, which I found &s;o much fault with when we were here la&s;t, and for putting in its place this beautiful plant; I &s;uppo&s;e you did it in order to give me an agreeably &s;urpri&s;e. How delightful and tempting the fruit looks! What fine grapes! &s;ome purple, and others almo&s;t black. I &s;ee no tree in the garden that looks in &s;o blooming a &s;tate. All have lo&s;t their fruit; but this fine one &s;eems in the highe&s;t perfection. See how it is loaded! See tho&s;e wide-&s;preading leaves that hide the clu&s;ters. If the fruit
<PB N="102" REF="047362_0107_1022CDF4B32AFFC0">
be as good as it appears beautiful, it mu&s;t be delicious."</P>
<P>Little Junius was in raptures when he ta&s;ted one of the grapes, which his father gave him; and &s;till more when he informed him, that from &s;uch fruit was made that delicious liquor, which he &s;ometimes ta&s;ted after dinner. The little fellow was quite a&s;toni&s;hed on hearing his father talk thus; but he was far more &s;urprized, when Mr. Jack&s;on told him, that all tho&s;e fine leaves, and delicious fruit, grew from that very crooked and mi&s;hapen &s;tump, with which he had been &s;o angry in the &s;pring. His father then a&s;ked him, if he &s;hould now or|der the gardener to pluck it up, and make fire-wood of it. Junius was much confu|&s;ed; but, after a &s;hort &s;ilence, told his papa, that he would rather &s;ee every other tree in the garden cut down than that, &s;o beautiful were its leaves, and &s;o delicious its fruit.</P>
<P>As Mr. Jack&s;on was a man of good &s;en&s;e, he thus moralized on this occa&s;ion. "You &s;ee then, my dear, (&s;aid he) how imprudent|ly I &s;hould have acted, had I followed your advice, and cut down this tree. Daily ex|perience convinces us, that the &s;ame thing happens frequently in the commerce of this
<PB N="103" REF="047362_0108_1022CDF637CD1C48">
world, which has in this in&s;tance mi&s;led you. When we &s;ee a child badly cloathed, and of an unplea&s;ing external appearance, we are too apt to de&s;pi&s;e him, and grow conceited on comparing our&s;elves with him; and &s;ometimes even go &s;o far as cruelly to ad|dre&s;s him in haughty and in&s;ulting lan|guage. But beware, my dear boy, how you run in errors by forming a too ha&s;ty judgment. It is po&s;&s;ible that in a per&s;on &s;o little favoured by nature, may dwell an ex|alted &s;oul, which may one day a&s;toni&s;h the world with the greatne&s;s of its virtues, or enlighten it with knowledge. The mo&s;t rugged &s;tem may produce the mo&s;t delicious fruit, while the &s;traight and &s;tately plant may be worthle&s;s and barren."</P>

</FIGURE> SIR JOHN DENHAM AND HIS WORTHY TENANT.</HEAD>
<P>ONE morning, Sir John Denham having &s;hut him&s;elf up in his &s;tudy on &s;ome particular bu&s;ine&s;s, his &s;ervant came to inform him that one of his tenants, farmer Harris, de&s;ired to &s;peak with him. Sir John told him to &s;hew the farmer into the drawing room, and to beg him to &s;tay one moment, until he had fini&s;hed writing a letter.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="047362_0110_1022CDFCCC05B2A0">Sir John had three children, Robert, Arthur, and Sophia, who were in the draw|ing-room when the farmer was introduced. As &s;oon as he entered, he &s;aluted them ve|ry re&s;pectfully, though not with the grace of a dancing-ma&s;ter, nor were his compli|ments very elegantly turned. The two &s;ons looked at each other with a &s;mile of con|tempt and di&s;re&s;pect. Indeed, they beha|ved in &s;uch a manner, that the poor farmer blu&s;hed, and was quite out of countenance.</P>
<P>Robert was &s;o &s;hamefully impertinent as to walk round him, holding his no&s;e, and a&s;king his brother, if he did not perceive &s;omething of the &s;mell of a dung-heap? Then he lighted &s;ome paper at the fire, and carried it round the room, in order to di&s;|per&s;e, as he &s;aid, the unplea&s;ant &s;mell. Ar|thur all the while &s;tood laughing mo&s;t hear|tily.</P>
<P>Sophia, however, acted in a very differ|ent manner; for, in&s;tead of imitating the rudene&s;s of her brothers, &s;he checked them for their behaviour, made apologies for them to the farmer, and approached him with the mo&s;t complai&s;ant looks, offered him &s;ome wine to refre&s;h him, made him &s;it down, and took from him his hat and &s;tick to put by.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="047362_0111_1022CDFF7898B948">In a little time, Sir John came out of his &s;tudy, and approaching the farmer in a friendly manner, took him by the hand, en|quired after the health of his family, and a&s;k|ed him what brought him to town. The far|mer replied, that he was, come to pay him a half year's rent, and that he hoped he would not be di&s;plea&s;ed at his not com|ing &s;ooner, the roads having been &s;o bad that he could not till then caary his corn to market.</P>
<P>Sir John told him he was not di&s;plea&s;ed at his not coming &s;ooner; becau&s;e he knew him to be an hone&s;t man, who had no oc|ca&s;ion to be put in mind of his debts. The farmer then put down the money, and drew out of his great-coat pocket a jar of candid fruits. "I have brought &s;omething here (&s;aid he) for the young folks. Won't you be &s;o kind, Sir John, as to let them come out one of the&s;e days, and take a mouthful of the country air with us? I'd try, as well as I could, to entertain and a|mu&s;e them. I have two good &s;tout nags, and would come for them my&s;elf, and take them down in my four-wheeled chai&s;e, which will carry them very &s;afely, I'll war|rant it."</P>
<P>Sir John &s;aid, that he would certainly
<PB N="107" REF="047362_0112_1022CE0100D7CA30">
take an opportunity to pay him a vi&s;it, and invited him to &s;tay to dinner; but the far|mer excu&s;ed him&s;elf, &s;aying, he had a good deal of bu&s;ine&s;s to do in town, and wi&s;hed to get home before night. Sir John filled his pocket with cakes for his children, thanked him for the pre&s;ent he had made to his, and then took leave of him.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the farmer gone, than Sophia, in the pre&s;ence of her brothers, ac|quainted her papa of the very rude recep|tion they had given the hone&s;t farmer. Sir John was exceedingly di&s;plea&s;ed at their conduct, and much applauded Sophia for her different behaviour.</P>
<P>Sir John, being &s;eated at breakfa&s;t with his children, opened the farmer's jar of fruit, and he and his daughter ate &s;ome of them, which they thought were very nice; but Robert and Arthur were neither of them invited to a &s;ingle ta&s;te. Their long|ing eyes were fixed upon them; but their father, in&s;tead of taking any notice of them, continued conver&s;ing with Sophia, whom he advi&s;ed never to de&s;pi&s;e a per&s;on merely for the plainne&s;s of his dre&s;s; "for, (&s;aid he) were we to behave politely to tho&s;e only who are finely clothed, we &s;hould appear to direct our attention more to the dre&s;s
<PB N="108" REF="047362_0113_1022CE03E49FC350">
than to the wearer. The mo&s;t worthy peo+ple are frequently found under the plaine&s;t dre&s;s, and of this we have an example in farmer Harris. It is this man who helps to clothe you, and al&s;o to procure you a pro|per education, for the money that he and my other tenants bring me, enables me to do the&s;e things."</P>
<P>Breakfa&s;t being fini&s;hed, the remainder of the fruit was ordered to be locked up; but Robert and his brother, who&s;e longing eyes followed the jar, clearly &s;aw they were to have none of them. In this they were confirmed by their father, who told them not to expect to ta&s;te any of tho&s;e fruits, either on that or any future day.</P>
<P>Robert endeavoured to excu&s;e him&s;elf, by &s;aying, that it was not his fault if the farmer did not &s;mell well; and he thought there was no harm in telling him of it. If people will go among dung, they mu&s;t ex|pect to &s;mell of it. "And yet, (&s;aid Sir John) if this man were not to manure his land with dung, his crops would fail him, he would not be able to pay his rent, and you your&s;elf would perhaps be obliged to follow a dung-cart." The two boys &s;aw di&s;plea&s;ure in their papa's countenance, and therefore did not pre&s;ume to &s;ay any thing more.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="047362_0114_1022CE06936F4FB0">Early on a morning &s;hortly after, the good farmer came to Sir John Denham's door, and &s;ent up his compliments, kindly inviting him to make a little excur&s;ion to his farm. Sir John could not re&s;i&s;t the friendly invitation, as a refu&s;al might per|haps have made the hone&s;t farmer unea&s;y. Robert and Arthur begged very hard to go along with them, promi&s;ing to behave more civilly in future, and Sophia begging for them likewi&s;e, Sir John at la&s;t con&s;ented. They then mounted the four-wheeled chai&s;e with joyful countenances, and as the farmer had a pair of good hor&s;es, they were there in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>On their arrival, Mrs. Harris, the far|mer's wife, came to the door to receive them, helped the young gentlefolks out of the chai&s;e, and ki&s;&s;ed them. All their little family, dre&s;&s;ed in their be&s;t clothes, came out to compliment their vi&s;itors. Sir John would have &s;topped a moment to talk with the little ones, and care&s;s them; but Mrs. Harris pre&s;&s;ed him to go in, le&s;t the coffee &s;hould grow cold, it being already poured out; it was placed on a table, covered with a napkin as white as &s;now.</P>
<P>Indeed the coffee-pot was not &s;ilver, nor the cups china, yet every thing was in the
<PB N="110" REF="047362_0115_1022CE0A679773C8">
neate&s;t order. Robert and Arthur, howe|ver, looked &s;lily at each other, and would have bur&s;t out into a laugh, had not their father been pre&s;ent. Mrs. Harris, who was a &s;en&s;ible woman, gue&s;&s;ed by their looks what they thought, and therefore made an apology for the humble &s;tile in which her table was &s;et out, which &s;he owned could not be equal to what they met with at their own homes; but hoped they would not be di&s;&s;atisfied with her homely fare. The cakes &s;he produced were excellent, for &s;he &s;pared no pains in making them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as breakfa&s;t was over, the farmer a&s;ked Sir John to look at his orchard and grounds, and Mrs. Harris took all the pains &s;he could to make the walk plea&s;ing to the children. She &s;hewed them all her flocks, which covered the fields, and gave them the prettie&s;t lambs to play with. She then con|ducted them to her pigeon-hou&s;e, where every thing was clean and whole&s;ome.&mdash; There were &s;ome &s;o young that they were unable to fly; &s;ome of the mothers &s;itting on their eggs, and others employed in feed|ing their young. From the pigeon hou&s;e they proceeded to the bee-hive; but Mrs. Harris took care that they &s;hould not go too near them, for fear of being &s;tung.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="047362_0116_1022CE0D1A457E90">Mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;ights being new to the children, they &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed with them, and were even going to take a &s;econd &s;urvey of them, when the farmer's younge&s;t &s;on came to inform them that dinner was ready. They eat off pewter, and drank out of Delft ware; but Robert and Arthur finding them&s;elves &s;o well plea&s;ed with their morning walk, dared not to indulge them|&s;elves in ill-natured ob&s;ervations. Mrs. Harris, indeed, had &s;pared neither pains nor attention to produce every thing in the be&s;t manner &s;he was able.</P>
<P>Sir John, after dinner, perceiving two fiddles hang up again&s;t the wall, a&s;ked who played on tho&s;e in&s;truments. The farmer an&s;wered, he and his &s;on; and without &s;ay|ing a word more, he made a &s;ign to his &s;on Luke to take down the fiddles. They by turns played &s;ome old tunes, with which Sir John &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed. As they were going to hang up the in&s;truments, Sir John de&s;ired his two &s;ons to play &s;ome of their be&s;t tunes, putting the fiddles into their hands; but they knew not even how to hold the bow, and their confu&s;ion occa&s;ioned a general laugh.</P>
<P>Sir John, now thinking it time to return home, de&s;ired the farmer to order the car|riage.
<PB N="112" REF="047362_0117_1022CE0E9EBDA4E8">
Farmer Harris &s;trongly pre&s;&s;ed Sir John to &s;tay all night, but the farmer was at la&s;t obliged to &s;ubmit to Sir John's ex|cu&s;es.</P>
<P>On his return home, he a&s;ked his &s;on Robert how he had liked his entertainment, and what he &s;hould have thought of the farmer, if he had taken no pains to entertain them. He replied, that he liked his enter|tainment; but had he not taken pains to accommodate them, he &s;hould have thought him an unmannerly clown. "Ah, Robert! Robert! (&s;aid Sir John) this hone&s;t man came to our hou&s;e, and, in&s;tead of offering him any refre&s;hment, you made game of him. Which then is the be&s;t bred, you or the farmer?"</P>
<P>Robert blu&s;hed, and &s;eemed at a lo&s;s what an&s;wer to make; but at length replied, that it was his duty to receive them well, as he got his living off their lands. "That is true, (an&s;wered Sir John) but it may be ea&s;ily &s;een who draws the greate&s;t profit from my lands, the farmer or I. He indeed feeds his hor&s;es with hay which he gets off my meadows, but his hor&s;es in return plow the fields, which otherwi&s;e would be over|run with weeds. He al&s;o feeds his cows and &s;heep with the hay; but their dung is
<PB N="113" REF="047362_0118_1022CE12768CC090">
u&s;eful in giving fertility to the ground. His wife and children are fed with the harve&s;t corn; but they in return devote the &s;ummer to weeding the crops; and afterwards, &s;ome in reaping them, and &s;ome in thre&s;hing. All the&s;e labours end in my advantage. The re&s;t of the hay and corn he takes to market to &s;ell, and with the produce thereof he pays his rent. From this it is evident, who derives the greate&s;t profit from my lands."</P>
<P>Here a long pau&s;e en&s;ued; but at la&s;t, Robert confe&s;&s;ed that he &s;aw his error.&mdash; "Remember then, all your life, (&s;aid Sir John) what has now been offered to your eyes and ears. This farmer, &s;o homely dre&s;&s;ed, who&s;e manners you have con&s;idered as &s;o ru&s;tic, this man is better bred than you; and, though he knows nothing of Latin, he knows much more than you, and things of much greater u&s;e. You &s;ee, there|fore, how unju&s;t it is to de&s;pi&s;e any one for the plainne&s;s of his dre&s;s, and the ru&s;ticity of his manners. You may under&s;tand a little Latin, but you know not how to plow, grow grain, or reap the harve&s;t, nor even to prune a tree.

</FIGURE> ALFRED AND DORINDA.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Venables, one fine &s;ummer day, having promi&s;ed his two children, Alfred and Dorinda, to treat them with a walk in a fine garden a little way out of town, went up into his dre&s;&s;ing-room to prepare him&s;elf, leaving the two children in the parlour.</P>
<P>Alfred was &s;o delighted with the thoughts of the plea&s;ure he &s;hould receive from his walk, that he jumped about the room, with|out thinking of any evil con&s;equences that
<PB N="115" REF="047362_0120_1022CE16A89BB8B0">
could happen; but unluckily the &s;kirt of his coat bru&s;hed again&s;t a very valuable flower, which his father was rearing with great pains, and which he had unfortunately ju&s;t removed from before the window, in order to &s;creen it from the &s;corching heat of the &s;un.</P>
<P>"O brother! brother! (&s;aid Dorinda, taking up the flower which was broken off from the &s;talk) what have you done!" &s;weet girl was holding the flower in her hand, when her father, having dre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf, came into the parlour. "Ble&s;s me, Dorinda, (&s;aid Mr. Venables in an angry tone) how could you be &s;o thoughtle&s;s as to pluck a flower, which you have &s;een me take &s;o much care to rear, in order to have &s;eed from it." Poor Dorinda was in &s;uch a fright, that &s;he could only beg her papa not to be angry. Mr. Venables, growing more calm, replied he was not angry, but reminded her, that as they were going to a garden where there were a variety of flow|ers, &s;he might have waited till they got there to indulge her fancy. He therefore hoped &s;he would not take it ami&s;s if he left her at home.</P>
<P>This was a terrible &s;ituation for Dorinda, who held her head down, and &s;aid nothing.
<PB N="116" REF="047362_0121_1022CE1A846292E8">
Little Alfred, however, was of too generous a temper to keep &s;ilence any longer. He went up to his papa, with his eyes &s;wim|ming in tears, and told him, that it was not his &s;i&s;ter but him&s;elf, who had accidentally beaten off the head of the flower with the flap of his coat.

<P>Mr. Venables was &s;o delighted with the genero&s;ity of his children, that he in&s;tantly forgave the accident, and tenderly ki&s;&s;ed them both, being happy to &s;ee them have &s;uch an affection for each other. He told them, that he loved them equally alike, and that they &s;hould both go with him. Alfred and Dorinda ki&s;&s;ed each other, and leaped about for joy.</P>
<P>They all three then walked to the gar|den, where they &s;aw plants of the mo&s;t va|luable kinds. Mr. Venables ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure how Dorinda pre&s;&s;ed her clothes on each &s;ide, and Alfred kept the &s;kirts of his coat under his arms, for fear of doing any damage in their walk among the flowers.</P>
<P>The flower Mr. Venables had lo&s;t would have given him &s;ome pain had it happened from any other circum&s;tance; but the plea|&s;ure he received from &s;eeing &s;uch mutual

<P>I WOULD recommend to all my little readers, who have had the misfortune to contract a vicious habit, very attentively to peru&s;e the following hi&s;torical fragment, in which, if they will but properly reflect, they will &s;ee that amendment is no very dif|ficult thing, when once they form a &s;incere re&s;olution to accompli&s;h it.</P>
<P>Ro&s;ina was the joy of her parents until the &s;eventh year of her age, at which period
<PB N="119" REF="047362_0124_1022CE1FE8829330">
the glowing light of rea&s;on begins to unfold it&s;elf, and make us &s;en&s;ible of our infantile faults; but this period of life had a different effect on Ro&s;ina, who had then contracted an unhappy di&s;po&s;ition, which cannot better be de&s;cribed, than by the practices of tho&s;e &s;narling curs that grumble ince&s;&s;antly, and &s;eem always ready to run at and bite tho&s;e that approach them.</P>
<P>If a per&s;on touched any of her play|things, though it were by mi&s;take, &s;he would be out of temper for hours, and murmur about the hou&s;e as though &s;he had been robbed. If any one attempted to cor|rect her, though in the mo&s;t gentle manner, &s;he would fly into a rage, equalled only by the fury of contending elements, and the uproar of the angry billows of the ocean.</P>
<P>Her father and mother &s;aw this unac|countable change with inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;orrow; for neither they, nor any one in the hou&s;e, could now bear with her. Indeed, &s;he would &s;ometimes &s;eem &s;en&s;ible of her errors, and would often &s;hed tears in private, on &s;eeing her&s;elf thus become the object of contempt to every one, not excepting her parents; but an ill habit had got the better of her temper, and &s;he con&s;equently every day grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="047362_0125_1022CE216D150018">One evening, which happened to be new year's eve, &s;he &s;aw her mother going towards her room, with a ba&s;ket under her cloak. Ro&s;ina followed her mother, who ordered her to go back to the parlour immediately. As Ro&s;ina went thither, &s;he threw about all the &s;tools and chairs that came in her way.</P>
<P>About half an hour after, her mamma &s;ent for her, and great indeed was her &s;urprize on &s;eeing the room lighted up with a num|ber of candles, and the table covered with the mo&s;t elegant toys.</P>
<P>Her mother called her to her, and de&s;ired her to read, in a bit of paper which &s;he gave her, for whom tho&s;e toys were intended, on which &s;he read the following words written in large letters: "For an amiable little girl, in return for her good behaviour." Ro&s;ina looked down, and could not &s;ay a word. On her mother's a&s;king her, for whom tho&s;e toys were intended, &s;he replied, with tears in her eyes, that they could not be intended for her.</P>
<P>Her parent then &s;hewed her another pa|per, de&s;iring her to &s;ee if that did not con|cern her. Ro&s;ina took it, and read as fol|lows: "For a froward little girl, who is &s;en&s;ible of her faults, and in beginning a new year will take pains to amend them."
<PB N="121" REF="047362_0126_1022CE2455092990">
Ro&s;ina, in&s;tantly throwing her&s;elf into her mother's arms, and crying bitterly, &s;aid, "O! that is I, that is I." The tears al&s;o fell from her parent's eyes, partly for &s;orrow on account of her daughter's faults, and partly through joy in the promi&s;ing hope of her amendment.</P>
<P>"Come Ro&s;ina, (&s;aid &s;he to her, after a &s;hort pau&s;e) and take what was intended for you, and may God, who has heard your re&s;olution, give you ability to fulfil it." Ro&s;ina, however, in&s;i&s;ted on it, that it be|longed to the per&s;on de&s;cribed in the fir&s;t paper, and therefore de&s;ired her mamma to keep tho&s;e things for her till &s;he an&s;wered that de&s;cription This an&s;wer gave her mother a deal of plea&s;ure, and &s;he immedi|ately put all the toys into a drawer, giving the key of it to Ro&s;ina, and telling her to open the drawer, whenever &s;he &s;hould think it proper &s;o to do.</P>
<P>Several weeks pa&s;&s;ed without the lea&s;t complaint again&s;t Ro&s;ina, who had per|formed wonders on her&s;elf. She then went to her mamma, threw her arms round her neck, and a&s;ked her if &s;he thought &s;he had then any right to open the drawer. "Yes, my dear, (&s;aid her mother, cla&s;ping her ten|derly in her arms) you may now open the
<PB N="122" REF="047362_0127_1022CE286ACA1DE8">
drawer with great propriety. But pray tell me how you have &s;o well managed to get the better of your temper?" Ro&s;ina &s;aid it had co&s;t her a deal of trouble; but every morning and evening, and indeed almo&s;t every hour in the day, &s;he prayed to God to a&s;&s;i&s;t her.</P>
<P>Her mother &s;hed tears of delight on this occa&s;ion; and Ro&s;ina became not only mi&s;|tre&s;s of the toys, but of the affections of all her friends and acquaintances. Her mother related this happy change in the temper of her daughter in the pre&s;ence of a little mi&s;s, who gave way to the &s;ame unhappy di&s;po|&s;ition; when the little girl was &s;o &s;truck with the relation of it, that &s;he immediately determined to &s;et about the work of refor|mation, in order to become as amiable as Ro&s;ina. Her attempt was not made in vain, and Ro&s;ina had the &s;atisfaction to find, that in being u&s;eful to her&s;elf, &s;he had con|tributed to make others happy. My youth|ful readers, if any of you labour under bad habits, &s;et about a reformation immediately, le&s;t you become hardened by time, and thus totally de&s;troy your pre&s;ent and future hap|pine&s;s.</P>

</FIGURE> LITTLE ANTHONY.</HEAD>
<P>ON one of tho&s;e fine mornings, which the month of June frequently affords us, little Anthony was bu&s;ily employed in preparing to &s;et out with his father on a party of plea&s;ure, which, for &s;everal days before, had engro&s;&s;ed all his attention. Though, in general, he found it very dif|ficult to ri&s;e early, yet this morning he got up &s;oon, without being called, &s;o much was his mind fixed on the intended jaunt.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="047362_0129_1022CE2CA1189860">It often happens, with young people in particular, that, all on a &s;udden, they lo&s;e the object they flattered them&s;elves they were almo&s;t in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. So it fared with little Anthony; for ju&s;t as they were ready to &s;et out, the &s;ky darkened all at once, the clouds grew thick, and a tem|pe&s;tuous wind bent down the trees, and rai&s;ed a cloud of du&s;t.</P>
<P>Little Anthony was running down the garden every minute to &s;ee how the &s;ky looked, and then jumped up &s;tairs to exa|mine the barometer; but neither the &s;ky nor the barometer &s;eemed to forebode any thing in his favour. Notwith&s;tanding all this he gave his father the mo&s;t flattering hopes that it would &s;till be a fair day, and that the&s;e unfavourable appearances would &s;oon di&s;per&s;e. He doubted not but that it would be one of the fine&s;t days in the world; and he therefore thought, that the &s;ooner they &s;et out the better, as it would be a pity to lo&s;e a moment of their time.</P>
<P>His father, however, did not chu&s;e to be too ha&s;ty in giving credit to his &s;on's pre|dictions, and thought it more advi&s;eable to wait a little. While Anthony and his fa|ther were rea&s;oning on this matter the clouds bur&s;t, and down came a very heavy &s;hower
<PB N="125" REF="047362_0130_1022CE3080AF2FA8">
of rain. Poor Anthony was now doubly di&s;|appointed, and vented his grief in tears, re|fu&s;ing to li&s;ten to the voice of con&s;olation.</P>
<P>The rain continued without intermi&s;&s;ion, till three o'clock in the afternoon, when the clouds began to di&s;per&s;e, the &s;un re&s;umed its &s;plendour, the element its clearne&s;s, and all nature breathed the odours of the &s;pring. As the weather brightened, &s;o did the coun|tenance of little Anthony, and by degrees he recovered his good humour.</P>
<P>His father now thought it nece&s;&s;ary to indulge him with a little walk, and off they &s;et. The calmne&s;s of the air, the mu&s;ic of the feathered &s;ong&s;ters, the lively and en|chanting verdure of the fields, and the &s;weet perfumes that breathed all round them, completely quieted and compo&s;ed the trou|bled heart of the di&s;appointed Anthony.</P>
<P>"Do you not ob&s;erve (&s;aid his father to him) how agreeable is the change of every thing before you? You cannot have yet forgotten how dull every thing appeared to us ye&s;terday; the ground was parched up for want of rain; the flowers had lo&s;t their colour, and hung their heads in langour; and, in &s;hort, all nature &s;eemed to be in a &s;tate of inaction. What can be the rea&s;on, that nature has &s;o &s;uddenly put on &s;uch a

<P>Anthony had no &s;ooner pronounced the&s;e words, than he &s;aw his father's motive for a&s;king him the que&s;tion. He now plainly perceived the impropriety of his late con|duct, in being &s;o unhappy about what was evidently &s;o univer&s;ally &s;erviceable. He blu&s;hed, but his father took no notice of it, judging that his own &s;en&s;e would &s;ufficiently teach him another time, without reluctance, to &s;acrifice &s;elfi&s;h plea&s;ure to the general good of the community at large.</P>

</FIGURE> THE HISTORY OF JONATHAN, THE GARDENER.</HEAD>
<P>IN the city of Lincoln lived an hone&s;t and indu&s;trious gardener, who&s;e name was Jonathan, and who was in general con&s;ider|ed as the mo&s;t &s;kilful in his profe&s;&s;ion of any in that country. His fruits were much larger than any of his neighbours, and were generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have a more exqui|&s;ite flavour.</P>
<P>It was the pride of all the neighbouring gentlemen to have Jonathan's fruits to form their de&s;erts, &s;o that he was under no nece&s;|&s;ity
<PB N="128" REF="047362_0133_1022CE38A855CE40">
of &s;ending the produce of his garden to market, as he was always &s;ure of meeting with a &s;ale for them at home. His pru|dence and a&s;&s;iduity increa&s;ed as his good fortune enlarged, and, in&s;tead of riches making him idle, he attended more clo&s;ely to cultivation.</P>
<P>Such a character and &s;ituation could not fail of procuring him a &s;uitable matrimonial mate, and he accordingly married a young woman in the neighbourhood, who&s;e name was Bella, and who was both prudent and hand&s;ome. The fir&s;t year of their mar|riage was as comfortable as they could wi&s;h for; for Bella a&s;&s;i&s;ted her hu&s;band in his bu&s;ine&s;s, and every thing pro&s;pered with them.</P>
<P>This happine&s;s, however, was not to la&s;t long; for near his hou&s;e lived another gar|dener, who&s;e name was Guzzle, and who &s;pent his time, from morning to night, in an alehou&s;e. The merry and thoughtle&s;s humour of Guzzle by degrees began to be plea&s;ing to Jonathan, who &s;oon fell into the &s;ame ruinous error. At fir&s;t, he only went now and then to drink with him, and talk with him, and talk to him about gardening; but he very &s;oon began to drop the &s;ubject of plants, and delight only in the prai&s;es of malt.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="047362_0134_1022CE3A2C149B60">Bella &s;aw this change in her hu&s;band with the utmo&s;t grief and con&s;ternation. As yet, not having &s;ufficient experience to attend the wall-fruit her&s;elf, &s;he was frequently obliged to fetch him home to his work, when &s;he generally found him in a &s;tate of intoxication. It would often have been bet|ter had he kept out of the garden than gone into it; for his head was generally &s;o mud|dled with beer when he went to work on his trees, that his prunning-knife committed the greate&s;t depredations, cutting away tho&s;e branches which ought to have been left, and leaving tho&s;e that were u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Hence it was not to be wondered at, that the garden fell off in the quality and quan|tity of its fruit, and the more Jonathan per|ceived the decay, the more he gave him&s;elf up to drinking. As his garden gradually failed in procuring him the means of get|ting &s;trong liquor, he fir&s;t parted with his furniture, and then with his linen and clothes.</P>
<P>Bella, in the mean time, did what little &s;he could to keep things together; but all to no purpo&s;e. One day, when &s;he was gone to market with &s;ome roots &s;he had reared her&s;elf, he went and &s;old his working uten&s;ils, and immediately went and &s;pent all
<PB N="130" REF="047362_0135_1022CE3E09FD30A0">
with Guzzle. Judge what mu&s;t be the &s;itu|ation of poor Bella on her return! It was indeed a heart-breaking con&s;ideration to be thus reduced to poverty by the folly of her hu&s;band; but yet &s;he loved him, and equal|ly felt for him as for her&s;elf, but &s;till more for an infant, as yet but &s;ix months old, and which received its nouri&s;hment from her brea&s;t.</P>
<P>In the evening, Jonathan came home drunk, and &s;wearing at his wife, a&s;ked her for &s;omething to eat. Bella handed him a knife, and put before him a large ba&s;ket covered with her apron, Jonathan in a pet pulled away the apron; but his a&s;toni&s;h|ment was inexpre&s;&s;ible, when he beheld nothing in the ba&s;ket but his own child fa&s;t a&s;leep. "Eat that, (&s;aid Bella) for I have nothing el&s;e to give you. It is your own child, and if you do not devour it, famine and mi&s;ery will in a &s;hort time."</P>
<P>Jonathan &s;eemed almo&s;t petrified into a &s;tone at the&s;e words, and for &s;ome time re|mained &s;peechle&s;s, with his eyes fixed on his little &s;leeping &s;on. At la&s;t recover|ing him&s;elf, quite &s;obered, his heart ea&s;ed it&s;elf in tears and lamentations. He ro&s;e and embraced his wife, a&s;ked her par|don, promi&s;ed to amend; and what was
<PB N="131" REF="047362_0136_1022CE40B35DEED0">
&s;till better, he was faithful to his pro|mi&s;e.</P>
<P>Though his wife's father had for &s;ome time refu&s;ed to &s;ee him, yet on being made acquainted with his promi&s;es of reforma|tion, he advanced money &s;ufficient to enable him to re&s;tore his garden to its former &s;tate. Jonathan did not deceive him; for his gar|den put on another appearance, and cut a more &s;plendid figure than ever. After this, neither his prudence or activity for&s;ook him, but he became at once, and continued &s;o even to old age, the hone&s;t man, the indul|gent hu&s;band, and the tender father. He would &s;ometimes tell this tale of his follies to his &s;on, as a le&s;&s;on to him, how danger|ous it is to get connected with bad company, and how ea&s;ily human nature is led a&s;tray by the poi&s;on of example. The &s;on, who thus acquired knowledge at the father's former expence, became a wi&s;e and prudent man, and conceived &s;uch an aver&s;ion to idle|ne&s;s and drinking, that he continued all his life as &s;ober as he was laborious. Thus was an innocent infant the cau&s;e of refor|mation in a deluded father.</P>

<P>BILLY Je&s;&s;amy, having one day e&s;pied a &s;parrow's ne&s;t under the eves of the hou&s;e, ran directly to inform his &s;i&s;ters of the important di&s;covery, and they immedi|ately fell into con&s;ultation concerning the manner in which they &s;hould take it. It was at la&s;t agreed, that they &s;hould wait till the young ones were fledged, that Billy &s;hould then get a ladder up again&s;t the wall, and that his &s;i&s;ters &s;hould hold it fa&s;t below, while he mounted after the prize.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="047362_0138_1022CE465AAA5AE0">As &s;oon as they thought the&s;e poor lit|tle creatures were properly fledged, prepa|rations were made for the execution of their intended plan. The old birds flew back|wards and forwards about the ne&s;t, and expre&s;&s;ed, as well as they were able, the &s;orrow and affliction they felt on being rob|bed of their young. Billy and his two &s;i&s;|ters, however, paid no regard to their pite|ous moans; for they took the ne&s;t, with three young ones it it.</P>
<P>As they had now got the innocent pri|&s;oners in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the next thing to be con&s;idered was what they &s;hould do with them. The younger &s;i&s;ter, being of a mild and tender-hearted di&s;po&s;ition, propo&s;ed putting them into a cage, promi&s;ing to look after them her&s;elf, and to &s;ee that they wanted for nothing. She reminded her brother and &s;i&s;ter how pretty it would be to &s;ee and hear tho&s;e birds when grown up.</P>
<P>Billy, however, was of a very different opinion; for he in&s;i&s;ted on it, that it would be better to pluck off their feathers, and then &s;et them down in the middle of the room, as it would be very funny to &s;ee how they would hop about without feathers. The elder &s;i&s;ter was of the &s;ame way of thinking as the younger; but Billy was
<PB N="134" REF="047362_0139_1022CE491DE18170">
determined to have the matter entirely his own way.</P>
<P>The two little ladies finding they were not likely to have things as they wi&s;hed, gave up the point without much he&s;itation; for Billy had already begun to &s;trip the poor helple&s;s birds. As fa&s;t as he plucked them, he put them down on the floor, and it was not long before the little birds were &s;tripped of all their tender feathers. The poor things cried, <HI>Weet! Weet!</HI> and complain|ed in the mo&s;t piteous accents; they &s;hook their little wings and &s;huddered with the cold.</P>
<P>Billy, however, who had not the lea&s;t kind of feeling for their &s;ufferings, carried his per&s;ecutions &s;till further, pu&s;hing them with his toe to make them go on when they &s;topped, and laughing mo&s;t heartily whenever they &s;taggered or tumbled down through weakne&s;s. Though his two &s;i&s;ters at fir&s;t &s;etting off had pleaded again&s;t this cruel kind of &s;port, yet &s;eeing their brother &s;o merry on the occa&s;ion, they forgot their former dictates of humanity, and joined in the cruel &s;port with him. Such, as we &s;aw in the preceding Tale is the influence of bad example!</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this cruel kind of enjoy|ment, at a di&s;tance they &s;aw their tutor ap|proaching.
<PB N="135" REF="047362_0140_1022CE4BD3A9B100">
This put them into &s;ome flurry, and each pocketed a bird. They would have avoided their tutor, but he called to them, and a&s;ked their rea&s;on for wi&s;hing to &s;hun him. They approached him very &s;lowly, with their eyes ca&s;t downwards, which convinced him that &s;omething ami&s;s was going forwards.</P>
<P>On their an&s;wering that they were only playing, their tutor ob&s;erved to them, that they very well knew he never denied them innocent amu&s;ement, but on the contrary was always glad to &s;ee them chearful and happy. He took notice that each held one of their hands in their pocket, upon which he in&s;i&s;ted on their pulling them out, and letting him &s;ee what it was they endeavoured to conceal.</P>
<P>They were obliged to comply, much again&s;t their will, when each produced a poor bird that had been &s;tripped of its fea|thers. The tutor was filled with pity and indignation, and gave each of them a look, that was more dreadful than any words he could have &s;poken. After &s;ome &s;ilence, Billy attempted to ju&s;tify him&s;elf by &s;aying, that it was a droll &s;ight to &s;ee &s;parrows hop|ping about without feathers, and he could &s;ee no harm in it.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="047362_0141_1022CE4D57438D18">"Can you then (&s;aid the tutor to Billy) take plea&s;ure in &s;eeing innocent creatures &s;uffer, and hear their cries without pity?" Billy &s;aid, he did not &s;ee how they could &s;uffer from having a few feathers pulled off. The tutor, to convince him of his error, pulled a few hairs from his head, when he roared out loudly, that he hurt him. "What would your pain be then, (&s;aid the tutor) were I thus to pluck all the hair off your head? You are &s;en&s;ible of the pain you now feel, but you was in&s;en&s;ible of the torment to which you put tho&s;e innocent creatures that never offended you. But that you, ladies, &s;hould join in &s;uch an act of cruelty, very much &s;urpri&s;es me!"</P>
<P>The ladies &s;tood motionle&s;s, and then, without being able to &s;ay a word, &s;at down with their eyes &s;wimming in tears; which their tutor ob&s;erving, he &s;aid no more to them. But Billy &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his opinion that he did the birds no harm; on the con|trary, he &s;aid, they &s;hewed their plea&s;ure by clapping their wings and chirping.</P>
<P>"They clapped their wings (&s;aid the tutor) from the pain you put them to; and what you call &s;inging, were cries and lamen|tations. Could tho&s;e birds have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in your &s;peech, you would have heard them cry, Ah, father and mother&punc;

&s;ave us, for we have fallen into the hands of cruel children, who have robbed us of all our feathers! We are cold and in pain. Come warm us and cure us, or we &s;hall &s;oon die!"</P>
<P>The little ladies could no longer refrain from tears, and accu&s;ed Billy of leading them into this act of cruelty. Billy was him&s;elf become &s;en&s;ible of his faults, and had already felt the &s;mart of having a few hairs plucked from his head; but the re|proaches of his own heart were now vi&s;ible on his countenance. It appeared to the tu|tor, that there was no need of carrying the puni&s;hment any further; for the error Billy had committed did not ari&s;e from a natural love of cruelty, but merely from want of thought and reflection. From this moment Billy, in&s;tead of puni&s;hing and tormenting dumb creatures, always felt for their di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, and did what he could to relieve them.</P>

</FIGURE> WILLIAM AND THOMAS; OR, THE CON|TRAST BETWEEN INDUSTRY AND IN|DOLENCE.</HEAD>
<P>IN a village at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the metropolis, lived a wealthy hu&s;bandman, who had two &s;ons, William and Thomas, of whom the former was exactly a year older than the latter.</P>
<P>On the day that the &s;econd &s;on was born, the hu&s;bandman &s;et in his orchard two young apple-trees of an equal &s;ize, on which he be&s;towed the &s;ame care in cultivating, and
<PB N="139" REF="047362_0144_1022CE57D31FEB78">
they throve &s;o much alike, that it was a dif|ficult matter to &s;ay which claimed the pre|ference.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the children were capable of u&s;ing garden implements, their father took them, on a fine day early in the &s;pring, to &s;ee the two plants he had reared for them, and called after their names. William and Thomas having much admired the beauty of the&s;e trees, now filled with blo&s;&s;oms, their father told them, that he made them a pre|&s;ent of them in good condition, and that they would continue to thrive or decay, in proportion to the labour or neglect they received.</P>
<P>Thomas, though the younger &s;on, turned all his attention to the improvement of his tree, by clearing it of in&s;ects as &s;oon as he di&s;covered them, and propping up the &s;tem that it might grow perfectly upright. He dug all round it, to loo&s;en the earth, that the root might receive nouri&s;hment from the warmth of the &s;un, and the moi&s;ture of the dews. No mother could nur&s;e her child more tenderly in its infancy, than Thomas did his tree.</P>
<P>His brother William, however, pur&s;ued a very different conduct; for he loitered away all his time in the mo&s;t idle and mi&s;|chievous manner, one of his principal
<PB N="140" REF="047362_0145_1022CE59572E6ED8">
amu&s;ements being to throw &s;tones at people as they pa&s;&s;ed. He kept company with all the idle boys in the neighbourhood, with whom he was continually fighting, and was &s;eldom without either a black eye or a broken &s;hin. His poor tree was neglected, and never thought of, till one day in the au|tumn, when by chance, &s;eeing his brother's tree loaded with the fine&s;t apples, and al|mo&s;t ready to break down with the weight, he ran to his own tree, not doubting but he &s;hould find it in the &s;ame plea&s;ing condition.</P>
<P>Great indeed was his di&s;appointment and &s;urpri&s;e, when, in&s;tead of finding the tree loaded with excellent fruit, he beheld no|thing but a few withered leaves, and branches covered with mo&s;s. He in&s;tantly went to his father, and complained of his partiality in giving him a tree that was worthle&s;s and barren, while his brother's produced the mo&s;t luxuriant fruit. He therefore thought, that his brother &s;hould, at lea&s;t, give him one-half of his apples.</P>
<P>His father told him, that it was by no means rea&s;onable, that the indu&s;trious &s;hould give up part of their labour to feed the idle. "If your tree, (&s;aid he) has produced you nothing, it is but a ju&s;t reward of your indolence, &s;ince you &s;ee what the indu&s;try of your brother has gained him. Your
<PB N="141" REF="047362_0146_1022CE5ADA0C2EB0">
tree was equally full of blo&s;&s;oms, and grew in the &s;ame &s;oil; but you paid no attention to the culture of it. Your brother &s;uffered no vi&s;ible in&s;ect to remain on his tree; but you neglected that caution, and left them even to eat up the very buds. As I cannot bear to &s;ee even plants peri&s;h through ne|glect, I mu&s;t now take this tree from you, and give it to your brother, who&s;e care and attention may po&s;&s;ibly re&s;tore it to its for|mer vigour. The fruit it &s;hall produce mu&s;t be his property, and you mu&s;t no longer con&s;ider your&s;elf as having any right therein. However, you may go to my nur&s;ery, and there choo&s;e any other, which you may like better, and try what you can do with it; but if you neglect to take pro|per care of it, I &s;hall al&s;o take that from you, and give it to your brother, as a re|ward for his &s;uperior indu&s;try and attention."</P>
<P>This had the de&s;ired effect on William, who clearly perceived the ju&s;tice and pro|priety of his father's rea&s;oning, and in&s;tantly got into the nur&s;ery to choo&s;e the mo&s;t thriv|ing apple-tree he could there meet with. His brother Thomas a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in the cul|ture of his tree, advi&s;ing him in what man|ner to proceed; and William made the be&s;t u&s;e of his time, and the in&s;tructions he re|ceived from his brother. He left off all
<PB N="142" REF="047362_0147_1022CE5ECB4E5D08">
his mi&s;chievous tricks, for&s;ook the com|pany of idle boys, applied him&s;elf chear|fully to work, and in autumn received the reward of his labour, his tree being then loaded with fruit.</P>
<P>From this happy change in his conduct he derived the advantage, not only of en|riching him&s;elf with a plentiful crop of fruit, but al&s;o of getting rid of bad and pernicious habits. His father was &s;o per|fectly &s;atisfied with his reformation, that the following &s;ea&s;on he gave him and his brother the produce of a &s;mall orchard, which they &s;hared equally between them.</P>

</FIGURE> MISCHIEF ITS OWN PUNISHMENT. EXEM|PLIFIED IN THE HISTORY OF WILLIAM AND HARRY.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Steven&s;on and his little &s;on Ri|chard, as they were one fine day walking in the fields together, pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;ide of a garden, in which they &s;aw a beau|tiful pear-tree loaded with fruit. Richard ca&s;t a longing eye at it, and complained to his papa that he was very dry. On Mr.
<PB N="144" REF="047362_0149_1022CE642348FD50">
Steven&s;on's &s;aying, that he was dry al&s;o, but they mu&s;t bear it with patience till they got home, Richard pointed to the pear-tree, and begged his papa would let him go and get one; for, as the hedge was not very thick, he &s;aid he could ea&s;ily get through, without being &s;een by any one.</P>
<P>Richard's father reminded him, that the garden and fruit were private property, and to take any thing from thence without per|mi&s;&s;ion was nothing le&s;s than being guilty of a robbery. He allowed, that there might be a po&s;&s;ibility of getting into the garden without being &s;een by the owner of it; but &s;uch a wicked action could not be concealed from him, who &s;ees every action of our lives, and who penetrates even into the very &s;ecrets of our hearts; and that is God.</P>
<P>His &s;on &s;hook his head, and &s;aid, he was &s;en&s;ible of his error, and would no more think of committing what might be called a robbery. He recollected, that par&s;on Jack&s;on had told him the &s;ame thing before, but he had then forgotten it.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant a man &s;tarted up from be|hind the hedge, which had before concealed him from their &s;ight. This was an old man, the owner of the garden, who had heard
<PB N="145" REF="047362_0150_1022CE66D25EBE58">
every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Steven&s;on and his &s;on. "Be thankful to God, my child, (&s;aid the old man) that your father prevented your getting into my garden, with a view to deprive me of that which does not belong to you. You little thought, that at the foot of each tree is placed a trap to catch thieves, which you could not have e&s;caped, and which might have lamed you for the re&s;t of your life. I am, however, happy to find, that you &s;o readily li&s;tened to the fir&s;t admonition of your father, and &s;hewed &s;uch a fear of of|fending God. As you have behaved in &s;o ju&s;t and &s;en&s;ible a manner, you &s;hall now, without any danger or trouble, partake of the fruit of my garden." He then went to the fine&s;t pear-tree, gave it a &s;hake, and brought down near a hatful of fruit, which he immediately gave to Richard.</P>
<P>This civil old man could not be prevailed on to accept of any thing in return, though Mr. Steven&s;on pulled out his pur&s;e for that purpo&s;e. "I am &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied, Sir, (&s;aid he) in thus obliging your &s;on, and were I to accept of any thing, that &s;atisfaction would be lo&s;t." Mr. Steven&s;on thanked him very kindly, and, having &s;haken hands over the hedge, they parted, Richard at the
<PB N="146" REF="047362_0151_1022CE69B8A6B368">
&s;ame time taking leave of the old man in a very polite manner.</P>
<P>Little Richard, having fini&s;hed &s;everal of the pears, began to find him&s;elf at lei&s;ure to talk to his papa. "This is a very good old man, (&s;aid he) but would God have puni&s;hed me, had I taken the&s;e pears with|out his leave?" "He certainly would, (re|plied Mr. Steven&s;on) for he never fails to reward good actions, and cha&s;ti&s;e tho&s;e who commit evil. The good old man fully explained to you this matter, in telling you of the traps laid for thieves, into which you mu&s;t have inevitably fallen, had you entered his garden in a clande&s;tine manner. God orders every thing that pa&s;&s;es upon earth, and directs events &s;o as to reward good people for virtuous actions, and to puni&s;h the wicked for their crimes. In or|der to make this more clear to you, I will relate to you an affair which happened when I was a boy, and which I &s;hall never for|get." Richard &s;eemed very attentive to his father, and having &s;aid he &s;hould be very glad to hear his &s;tory, Mr. Steven&s;on thus proceeded:</P>
<P>"When I lived with my father, and was much about your age, we had two neigh|bours, between who&s;e hou&s;es ours was &s;itu|ated,
<PB N="147" REF="047362_0152_1022CE6C6E7AA6B0">
and their names were Davis and John&s;on. Mr. Davis had a &s;on named William, and Mr. John&s;on one al&s;o of the name of Harry. Our gardens were at that time &s;eparated only by quick&s;et hedges, &s;o that it was ea&s;y to &s;ee into each other's grounds.</P>
<P>"It was too often the practice with William, when he found him&s;elf alone in his father's garden, to take plea&s;ure in throwing &s;tones over the hedges, without paying the lea&s;t regard to the mi&s;chief they might do. Mr. Davis had frequently caught him at this dangerous &s;port, and ne|ver failed &s;everely to reprimand him for it threatening him with &s;evere puni&s;hment if he did not de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>"This child, unhappily, either knew not, or would not take the trouble to reflect, that we are not to do ami&s;s, even when we are alone, for rea&s;ons I have already men|tioned to you. His father being one day gone out, and therefore thinking that no|body could &s;ee him, or bring him to pu|ni&s;hment, he filled his pockets with &s;tones, and then began to fling them about at ran|dom.</P>
<P>"Mr. John&s;on happened to be in his garden at the &s;ame time, and his &s;on Harry
<PB N="148" REF="047362_0153_1022CE6DF2FF9E48">
with him. This boy was of much the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition as William, thinking there was no crime in committing any mi&s;chief, pro|vided he were not di&s;covered. His father had a gun charged, which he brought into the garden, in order to &s;hoot the &s;parrows that made &s;ad havock among his cherries, and was &s;itting in a &s;ummer-hou&s;e to watch them.</P>
<P>"At this in&s;tant, a &s;ervant came to ac|quaint him, that a &s;trange gentleman de&s;ired to &s;peak with him, and was waiting in the parlour. He therefore put down the gun in the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, and &s;trictly ordered Harry by no means to touch it; but he was no &s;ooner gone, than his naughty &s;on &s;aid to him&s;elf, that he could &s;ee no harm in playing a little with the gun, and there|fore took it up, put it on his &s;houlder, and endeavoured to act the part of a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>"The muzzle of the gun happened to be pointed towards Mr. Davis's garden, and ju&s;t as he was in the mid&s;t of his mili|tary exerci&s;es, a &s;tone thrown by William hit him directly in one of his eyes. The fright and pain together made Harry drop the gun, which went off, and in a moment both gardens re&s;ounded with the mo&s;t di&s;|mal &s;hrieks and lamentations. Harry had
<PB N="149" REF="047362_0154_1022CE71E66B7300">
received a blow in the eye with a &s;tone, and the whole charge had entered William's leg. The &s;ad con&s;equences of which were, the one lo&s;t his eye, and the other a leg."</P>
<P>Richard could not help pitying poor William and Harry for their terrible mi&s;|fortune; and Mr. Steven&s;on was not angry with his &s;on for his tenderne&s;s. "It is true, (&s;aid he) they were much to be piti|ed, and their parents &s;till more, for hav|ing &s;uch vicious and di&s;obedient children. Yet it is probable, if God had not early puni&s;hed the&s;e boys, they would have con|tinued their mi&s;chievous practices as often as they &s;hould find them&s;elves alone; but by this mi&s;fortune they learned to know, that God publicly puni&s;hes all wickedne&s;s done in &s;ecret. This had the de&s;ired effect, as both ever after left off all kinds of mi&s;|chief, and became prudent and &s;edate. Certain it is, that an all-wi&s;e Creator never cha&s;ti&s;es us but with a view to add to our happine&s;s."</P>
<P>Richard was very much &s;truck with this &s;tory, and &s;aid he hoped he &s;hould never lo&s;e either a leg or an eye by &s;uch impru|dent conduct. This intere&s;ting conver&s;a|tion was interrupted by their arrival at their own hou&s;e, when Richard ha&s;tened to find
<PB N="150" REF="047362_0155_1022CE7499C51F48">
his brothers and &s;i&s;ters, to tell them the ad|ventures of his walk, and the hi&s;tory of William and Harry.</P>

</FIGURE> ANTONY AND AUGUSTUS; OR, A RA|TIONAL EDUCATION PREFERABLE TO RICHES.</HEAD>
<P>A VERY early friend&s;hip commenced between Antony and Augu&s;tus, who were nearly of an age, and as they were neighbours, they were almo&s;t in&s;eparable companions. The father of Antony, who&s;e name was Lenox, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very lucrative employment under government, and was be&s;ides po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con&s;iderable fortune;
<PB N="152" REF="047362_0157_1022CE7A48EEFCC0">
but Mr. Littleton, the father of Augu&s;tus, was not in &s;uch affluent circum&s;tances, tho' he lived contentedly, and turned all his thoughts to the welfare and happine&s;s of his &s;on, in giving him a well-grounded educa|tion, which he thought might prove of more advantage to him than riches, or, at lea&s;t, might amply &s;upply the place of them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Augu&s;tus was nine years of age, he was accu&s;tomed to bodily exerci&s;e, and his mind inured to &s;tudy, which at once contributed to improve his health, &s;trength, and under&s;tanding. Being thus u&s;ed to ex|erci&s;e and motion, he was healthy and ro|bu&s;t; and being contented and happy in the affection of his parents, he enjoyed a tranquil chearfulne&s;s, which much influ|enced tho&s;e who enjoyed his company.</P>
<P>Antony was one of his happy compa|nions, who was always at a lo&s;s for amu&s;e|ment when Augu&s;tus was ab&s;ent; and in that ca&s;e, in order to fill up his time, he was continually eating without being hungry, drinking without being dry, and &s;lumber|ing without being &s;leepy. This naturally brought on a weak habit of body, and fre|quent head-achs.</P>
<P>Both parents ardently wi&s;hed to &s;ee their children healthy and happy; but Mr. Lenox
<PB N="153" REF="047362_0158_1022CE7CF4EB39D8">
unfortunately pur&s;ued that object in a wrong channel, by bringing up his &s;on, even from his cradle, in the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive delicacy. He was not &s;uffered to lift him&s;elf a chair, whenever he had a mind to change his &s;eat, but a &s;ervant was called for that purpo&s;e. He was dre&s;&s;ed and undre&s;&s;ed by other peo|ple, and even the cutting of his own vic|tuals &s;eemed a pain to him.</P>
<P>While Augu&s;tus in a thin linen jacket, a&s;&s;i&s;ted his father to cultivate a &s;mall garden for their amu&s;ement, Antony, in a rich velvet coat, was lolling in a coach, and paying morning vi&s;its with his mamma. If he went abroad to enjoy the air, and got out of his carriage but for a minute, his great coat was put on, and a handkerchief tied round his neck, to prevent his catching cold. Thus accu&s;tomed to be humoured to exce&s;s, he wi&s;hed for every thing he &s;aw or could think of; but his wi&s;h was no &s;ooner obtained, than he became tired of it, and was con&s;tantly unhappy in the pur&s;uit of new objects.</P>
<P>As the &s;ervants had &s;trict orders to obey him with implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he became &s;o whim&s;ical and imperious, that he was hated and de&s;pi&s;ed by every one in the hou&s;e, ex|cepting his parents. Augu&s;tus was his only
<PB N="154" REF="047362_0159_1022CE7FA6471280">
companion who loved him, and it was upon that account he patiently put up with his humours. He was &s;o perfectly ma&s;ter of his temper, that he would at times make him as good humoured as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Lenox would &s;ometimes a&s;k Augu&s;tus, how he contrived to be always &s;o merry; to which he one day an&s;wered, that his fa|ther had told him, that no per&s;on could be perfectly happy, unle&s;s they mixed &s;ome kind of employment with their plea&s;ures. "I have frequently ob&s;erved, (continued Augu&s;tus) that the mo&s;t tedious and dull days I experience are tho&s;e, in which I do no kind of work. It is properly blending exerci&s;e with amu&s;ement that keeps me in &s;uch good health and &s;pirits. I fear neither the winds nor the rain, neither the heat of &s;ummer nor the cold of winter, and I have frequently dug up a whole plat in my gar|den before Antony has quitted his pillow in the morning."</P>
<P>Mr. Lenox felt the propriety of &s;uch conduct, and a &s;igh unavoidably e&s;caped him. He then went to con&s;ult Mr. Little|ton in what manner he &s;hould act, in order to make Anthony as hearty and robu&s;t as Augu&s;tus. Mr. Littleton informed him in what manner he treated his &s;on. "The
<PB N="155" REF="047362_0160_1022CE812E03FFB0">
powers of the body and the mind (&s;aid he) &s;hould be equally kept in exerci&s;e; unle&s;s we mean them to be un&s;erviceable, as money buried in the ground would be to its owner. Nothing can be more injurious to the health and happine&s;s of children, than u&s;ing them to exce&s;s of delicacy, and, under the idea of plea&s;ing them, to indulge them in their whim&s;ical and ob&s;tinate humours. The per&s;on who has been accu&s;tomed from his childhood to have his flattered, will be ex|po&s;ed to many vexatious di&s;appointments. He will &s;igh after tho&s;e things, the want or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which will equally make him mi&s;erable. I have, however, every rea&s;on to believe, that Augu&s;tus will never be that man."</P>
<P>Mr. Lenox &s;aw the truth of tho&s;e argu|ments, and determined to adopt the &s;ame plan for the the treatment of his &s;on. But it was now too late, for Antony was four|teen years of age, and his mind and body &s;o much enervated, that he could not bear the lea&s;t fatiguing exertions. His mother, who was as weak as him&s;elf begged of her hu&s;band not to teaze their darling, and he was at la&s;t obliged to give way to her impor|tunities, when Antony again &s;unk into his former de&s;tructive effeminacy. The &s;trength
<PB N="156" REF="047362_0161_1022CE83E5BB4188">
of his body declined, in proportion as his mind was degraded by ignorance.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Antony had entered his &s;even|teenth year, his parents &s;ent him to the uni|ver&s;ity, intending to bring him up to the &s;tudy of the law; and Augu&s;tus being in|tended for the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, he accom|panied him thither. Augu&s;tus, in his dif|ferent &s;tudies and pur&s;uits, had never had any other in&s;tructor than his father; while Antony had as many ma&s;ters as there are different &s;ciences, from whom he learned only a &s;uperficial education, by retaining little more than the terms u&s;ed in the differ|ent branches he had &s;tudied. Augu&s;tus, on the contrary, was like a garden, who&s;e airy &s;ituation admits the rays of the &s;un to every part of it, and in which every &s;eed, by a proper cultivation, advances rapidly to perfection. Already well in&s;tructed, he &s;till thir&s;ted after further knowledge, and his diligence and good behaviour afforded a pat|tern for imitation to all his companions. The mildne&s;s of his temper, and his viva|city and &s;prightly humour, made his com|pany at all times de&s;irable; he was univer|&s;ally beloved, and every one was his friend.</P>
<P>Antony was at fir&s;t happy on being in the &s;ame room with Augu&s;tus; but his pride
<PB N="157" REF="047362_0162_1022CE87C37CAB70">
was &s;oon hurt on &s;eeing the preference that was given by every one to his friend, and he could not think of any longer &s;ubmit|ting to &s;o mortifying a di&s;tinction. He therefore found &s;ome frivolous excu&s;e, and for&s;ook the company of Augu&s;tus.</P>
<P>Antony, having now nobody to advi&s;e or check him, gave loo&s;e to his vitiated ta&s;te, and wandered from plea&s;ure to plea&s;ure in &s;earch of happine&s;s. It will be to little pur|po&s;e to &s;ay, how often he blu&s;hed at his own conduct; but being hardened by a repeti|tion of his follies, he gradually fell into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t irregularities. To be &s;hort, he at la&s;t returned home with the &s;eeds of a mor|tal di&s;temper in his bo&s;om, and after lan|gui&s;hing a few months, expired in the greate&s;t agonies.</P>
<P>Some time after, Augu&s;tus returned home to his parents, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an equal &s;tock of learning and prudence, his departure from the univer&s;ity being regretted both by his teachers and companions. It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that his family received him with tran&s;ports of joy. You know not, my little readers, how plea&s;ing are tho&s;e tender parental feelings, which ari&s;e from the pro&s;pect of &s;eeing their children beloved and re&s;pected! His parents thought them|&s;elves
<PB N="158" REF="047362_0163_1022CE894828AB38">
the happie&s;t of people, and tears of joy filled their eyes when they beheld him.</P>
<P>Augu&s;tus had not been long at home, be|fore a con&s;iderable employment in his pro|fe&s;&s;ion was conferred on him, with the una|nimous approbation of all who were ac|quainted with his character. This enabled him to gratify his generous de&s;ire of pro|moting the felicity of his friends, and a &s;en&s;e of their happine&s;s added to his own. He was the comfort of his parents in the even|ing of their lives, and with intere&s;t repaid their attention and care of him in his child|hood. An amiable wife, equally endued with &s;en&s;e, virtue, and beauty, who bore him children like him&s;elf, compleated his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>In the characters of Antony and Augu&s;|tus, we &s;ee the fatal con&s;equences of giving way to folly and vice, and what a happy ef|fect the contrary conduct has. Antony fell a victim to the mi&s;guided indulgence of his parents, while Augu&s;tus lived to be happy by the prudent management he received in his infancy.</P>

<P>ON a fine evening, in the mid&s;t of &s;um|mer, Mr. Drake and his &s;on Albert took a walk in &s;ome of the mo&s;t agreeable environs of the city. The &s;ky was clear, the air cool, and the purling &s;treams, and gentle zephyrs ru&s;tling in the trees, lulled the mind into an agreeable gloom. Albert, enchanted with the natural beauties that &s;urrounded him, could not help exclaiming,

"What a lovely evening!" He pre&s;&s;ed his father's hand, and looking up to him, &s;aid, "You know not papa, what thoughts ri&s;e in my heart!" He was &s;ilent for a moment, and then looking towards heaven, his eyes moi&s;tened with tears, "I thank God (&s;aid he) for the happy moments he now permits me to enjoy! Had I my wi&s;h, every one &s;hould ta&s;te the beauties of this evening as I do. Were I king of a large country I would make my &s;ubjects perfectly happy."</P>
<P>Mr. Drake embraced his &s;on, and told him, that the benevolent wi&s;h he had ju&s;t uttered came from a heart as generous as it was humane. "But would not your thoughts change with your fortune? Are you certain, that in an exalted &s;tation you &s;hould pre&s;erve the &s;entiments, which now animate you in that middling &s;tate, in which it has plea&s;ed heaven to place you?"</P>
<P>Albert was a little &s;urpri&s;ed that his father &s;hould a&s;k &s;uch a que&s;tion; for he had no idea that riches could bring with them cru|elty and wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Drake told him, that indeed was not always the ca&s;e. "The world has pro|duced fortunate per&s;ons, (&s;aid he) who have remembered their pa&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and who have always retained the mo&s;t charita|ble

ideas for the unfortunate; but we too often &s;ee, what is a di&s;grace to the human heart, that a change of fortune alters the mo&s;t tender and &s;ympathetic affections. While we our&s;elves labour under misfor|tunes, we look upon it as a duty incumbent on every man to a&s;&s;i&s;t us. Should the hand of God relieve us, we then think, that all his intentions in the pre&s;ervation of the world are an&s;wered, and too often cea&s;e to remember tho&s;e unfortunate wretches, who remain in the gulph from which we have been re&s;cued. You may &s;ee an in&s;tance of this in the man, who frequently comes to beg charity of me, whom I relieve with re|luctance, and cannot but cen&s;ure my&s;elf for &s;o doing."</P>
<P>Albert told his father that he had fre|quently ob&s;erved how coolly he put money into his hands, without &s;peaking to him in that tender language, which he generally u&s;ed to other poor people. He therefore begged his father would tell him what could be his rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>"I will tell you, my dear, (&s;aid Mr. Drake) what has been his conduct, and then leave you to judge how far I do right. Mr. Ma&s;on was a linen-draper in Cheap&s;ide; and, though the profits of his bu&s;ine&s;s were but
<PB N="162" REF="047362_0167_1022CE94162BB860">
moderate, yet a poor per&s;on never a&s;ked his charity in vain. This he viewed as his mo&s;t plea&s;ing extravagance, and he con&s;idered him&s;elf happy in the enjoyment of it, tho' he could not pur&s;ue this indulgence to the extent of his wi&s;hes. Bu&s;ine&s;s one day call|ing him on 'Change, he heard a number of capital merchants talking together of va&s;t cargoes, and the immen&s;e profits to be ex|pected from them. 'Ah! (&s;aid he to him|&s;elf) how happy the&s;e people are! Were I as rich, heaven knows, I &s;hould not make money my idol, for the poor &s;hould plenti|fully partake of my abundance.'</P>
<P>"This man went home with a bo&s;om full of ambitious thoughts; but his cir|cum&s;tances were too narrow to embrace his va&s;t projects, as it required no &s;mall &s;hare of prudence in the management of his af|fairs, to make every thing meet at the end of the year. 'Ah! (cried he) I &s;hall ne|ver get forward, nor ri&s;e above the mid|dling condition, in which I at pre&s;ent linger.'</P>
<P>"In the mid&s;t of the&s;e gloomy thoughts, a paper, inviting adventurers to purcha&s;e &s;hares in the lottery was put into his hand. He &s;eemed as if in&s;pired by Fortune, and caught the idea immediately. Without con&s;idering the inconvenience to which his
<PB N="163" REF="047362_0168_1022CE98002D2698">
covetou&s;ne&s;s might reduce him, he ha&s;tened to the lottery office, and there laid out four guineas. From this moment, he waited with impatience for the drawing, nor could he find repo&s;e even at night on his pillow. He &s;ometimes repented of having &s;o fool|i&s;hly hazarded what he could not well bear the lo&s;s of, and at other times he fancied he &s;aw riches pouring in upon him from all quarters. At la&s;t the drawing began, and, in the mid&s;t of his hopes and fears, Fortune favoured him with a prize of five thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>"Having received his money, he thought of nothing el&s;e for &s;everal days; but when his imagination had cooled a little, he began to think what u&s;e he &s;hould make of it. He therefore encrea&s;ed his &s;tock, extended his bu&s;ine&s;s, and by care and a&s;&s;iduity in trade &s;oon doubled his capital. In le&s;s than ten years, he became one of the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able men in the city, and hitherto he had punctually kept his promi&s;e, in being the friend and patron of the poor; for the &s;ight of an unfortunate per&s;on always put him in mind of his former condition, and pleaded powerfully in behalf of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"As he now frequented gay company, he by degrees began to contract a habit of
<PB N="164" REF="047362_0169_1022CE9AC4F03C88">
luxury and di&s;&s;ipation; he purcha&s;ed a &s;plendid country-hou&s;e with elegant gar|dens, and his life became a &s;cene of unin|terrupted plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements. All this extravagance, however, &s;oon convinced him, that he was con&s;iderably reducing his fortune; and his trade, which he had given up, to be the more at lei&s;ure for the enjoy|ment of his plea&s;ures, no longer enabled him to repair it. Be&s;ides, having been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to put no re&s;traint on his vanity and pride, he could not &s;ubmit to the meanne&s;s of le&s;&s;ening his expences. 'I &s;hall always have enough for my&s;elf (thought he) and let others take care of them&s;elves.'</P>
<P>"As his fortune decrea&s;ed, &s;o did his feelings for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and his heart grew callous to the cries of mi&s;ery, as with indif|ference we hear the roaring tempe&s;t when &s;heltered from its fury. Friends, whom he had till then &s;upported, came as u&s;ual to implore his bounty; but he received them roughly, and forbid them his hou&s;e. 'Am I, (&s;aid he) to &s;quander my fortune upon you? Do as I have done, and get one for your&s;elves.'</P>
<P>"His poor unhappy mother, from whom he had taken half the pen&s;ion he u&s;ed to al|low her, came to beg a corner in any part

of his hou&s;e, where &s;he might fini&s;h her few remaining days; but he was &s;o cruel as to refu&s;e her reque&s;t, and with the utmo&s;t indifference &s;aw her peri&s;h for want. The mea&s;ure of his crimes, however, was now nearly filled. His wealth was all &s;oon ex|hau&s;ted in debaucheries and other exce&s;&s;es, and he had neither the inclination nor ability to return to trade. Mi&s;ery &s;oon overtook him, and brought him to that &s;tate in which you now &s;ee him.

<P>Albert told his father, that if fortune made men &s;o wicked and mi&s;erable, he wi&s;h|ed to remain as he was, above pity, and &s;ecure from contempt.</P>
<P>"Think often, my dear child, (&s;aid his father to him) of this &s;tory, and learn from this example, that no true happine&s;s can be enjoyed, unle&s;s we feel for the misfortunes of others. It is the rich man's duty to re|lieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor, and in this more &s;olid plea&s;ure is found, than can be expected from the enervating exce&s;&s;es of luxury and pomp."</P>
<P>The &s;un was now &s;inking beneath the

The air, fre&s;hened by the approach of even|ing, breathed an agreeable calm; and the feathered inhabitants of the grove &s;ung their farewel &s;ong. The wind ru&s;tling among the trees added a gentle murmur to the concert, and every thing &s;eemed to in&s;pire joy and happine&s;s, while Albert and his father returned to their hou&s;e with thoughtful and pen&s;ive &s;teps.</P>

</FIGURE> WILLIAM AND AMELIA.</HEAD>
<P>IN a plea&s;ant village, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the metropolis, lived Lord and Lady Ru&s;&s;el, who had brought up an or|phan named William, from his infancy, and had a &s;tranger to the family &s;een in what a tender manner he was treated, he would have &s;uppo&s;ed him to be their &s;on. This amiable couple had only one child living, a daughter, named Amelia, who was nearly of the &s;ame age with William, and the lady was plea&s;ed to &s;ee that the two children had
<PB N="168" REF="047362_0173_1022CEA0372C5038">
&s;omething beyond a common attachment for each other.</P>
<P>William and Amelia were one fine &s;um|mer morning &s;auntering in the orchard with their little friend Charlotte, who&s;e parents lived in the neighbourhood. Of the&s;e two little mi&s;&s;es, Amelia was the younge&s;t, and not quite eight years of age. They were walking arm in arm, and humming over a pretty &s;ong, then fa&s;hionable in the village collection of ballads. At the &s;ame time William was walking before them, at &s;ome little di&s;tance, amu&s;ing him&s;elf with a &s;hep|herd's pipe.</P>
<P>While Amelia and Charlotte were thus rambling about, they ca&s;t their eyes on &s;ome beautiful apples that hung on a fine tree, from which all the fruit had been &s;up|po&s;ed to be gathered; but the branches had hidden &s;ome from view, and in cour&s;e had e&s;caped the notice of the gatherers. The beautiful vermilion, with which the&s;e ap|ples were tinged, and which the leaves could not entirely hide, &s;eemingly invited the hand to come and take them. William in|&s;tantly climbed the tree they were admiring, and threw down as many apples as he could reach, while the ladies below held their aprons to catch them as they fell.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="047362_0174_1022CEA2E8075468">Chance &s;o directed it, that two or three, which were con&s;idered as the fine&s;t, fell into the apron of Charlotte, who was much plea&s;ed with this accidental di&s;tribution, as &s;he might with rea&s;on have been, had a pre|meditated preference been the cau&s;e of it, for William was in reality the polite&s;t and prettie&s;t little fellow in the village.</P>
<P>Charlotte, with joy and triumph in her eyes, thus addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Amelia: "Only &s;ee how fine and large my apples are, while yours are nothing to compare to them!" Amelia was very much di&s;plea&s;ed with the&s;e words, &s;he hung down her head, and putting on a &s;erious countenance, re|mained &s;ilent during the remainder of the walk. William, by an hundred a&s;&s;iduities, endeavoured to recover Amelia's chearful|ne&s;s, again to &s;pread a &s;mile on her clouded countenance, and make her renew her u&s;ual plea&s;ing prattle.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they arrived near home, Char|lotte took her leave. Little William then addre&s;&s;ed his &s;i&s;ter, for by that tender name he always called her, and a&s;ked her why &s;he &s;eemed &s;o angry with him. "Certainly, (&s;aid he) you cannot be angry at Charlotte having her &s;hare of the apples. You very well know that I always loved you be&s;t,
<PB N="170" REF="047362_0175_1022CEA46CCBE540">
and therefore endeavoured to throw into your apron tho&s;e apples, which, by chance, fell into Charlotte's. You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that I could not afterwards take them from her. Be&s;ides, I thought you of too gene|rous a di&s;po&s;ition to take notice of &s;uch trifles. Be a&s;&s;ured, the fir&s;t opportunity that &s;hall offer, I will give you a convincing proof that I had no de&s;ign to vex you, what|ever you may at pre&s;ent think of my inten|tions."</P>
<P>"Very pretty, indeed, Mr. William! (replied Amelia, with a look of unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;dain.) Pray who told you that I was vexed? Suppo&s;e Mi&s;s Charlotte's apples had been ten times finer than mine, would that be any con&s;ideration to me? You very well know, Sir, that I am no glutton; nei|ther &s;hould I have taken any notice of the preference you &s;hewed her, had it not been for that &s;aucy little creature's looks. I ne|ver wi&s;h to &s;ee her more; and as for you, fall down on your knees this in&s;tant, or I never will forgive you while I live."</P>
<P>Little William could not think of &s;ub|mitting to &s;uch an indignity, as that would be confe&s;&s;ing a fault of which he was not guilty, and therefore now &s;tood more up|right than before. "I am no &s;tory-teller,
<PB N="171" REF="047362_0176_1022CEA8477E84A0">
Mi&s;s Amelia, (&s;aid he) and therefore it is very wrong in you not to believe what I &s;o po&s;itively affirm, for I certainly had no de|&s;ign to vex you."</P>
<P>"Very wrong in me, Sir! (replied Amelia.) That is pretty indeed! But you need not thus affront me, becau&s;e Mi&s;s Char|lotte is your favourite!" So &s;aying, and be&s;towing a contemptuous curt&s;ey on him, &s;he left him with an affected air of &s;corn and contempt.</P>
<P>Dinner being now ready, they &s;at down at table, but pouted at each other all the time it la&s;ted. Amelia would not once drink, in order to avoid &s;aying, "Your good health, William." And William, on his part, was &s;o vexed at her treatment of him, that he was determined not to give up the point. Amelia, however, could not help &s;ometimes &s;tealing a glance at William, and from a corner of her eye watch all his motions. As it happened, one of the&s;e &s;ly glances met the eye of William, who was equally attentive to watch all the mo|tions of Amelia, without wi&s;hing to be ob&s;erved. Their eyes thus meeting, &s;he in&s;tantly turned hers away to another object; and as William attributed this to contempt, which in reality it was not, he affected much
<PB N="172" REF="047362_0177_1022CEAAF1EBD8A0">
indifference, and continued eating with the mo&s;t apparent compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the cloth was removed, and the wine and fruit put on the table, poor Amelia, being &s;adly out of temper at the indifference &s;he experienced from William, made a di&s;re&s;pectful an&s;wer to a que&s;tion put to her by her mamma, and, for a &s;econd offence of the &s;ame nature, was ordered to retire from table. She obeyed, and bur&s;t|ing into a flood of tears, in&s;tantly withdrew, without caring whither &s;he went. How|ever, it &s;o happened, that the garden door was open; &s;he therefore flew down the walk, and went into the arbour, in order there in &s;ecret to give a vent to her grief. Here &s;he cried mo&s;t lamentably; and &s;oon re|pented of her quarrelling with William, who con&s;tantly, whenever &s;he happened to get into di&s;grace with her mamma, would not only weep with her, but endeavour to bring about a reconciliation, which he ne|ver failed to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>Though William continued at table, he could not help feeling for the di&s;grace of Amelia. He had fixed his eye on two peaches, and endeavoured to contrive means of getting them into his pocket in order to convey them to Amelia, whom he knew he
<PB N="173" REF="047362_0178_1022CEAD9F2E0A58">
&s;hould find &s;omewhere in the garden, and he could ea&s;ily make an excu&s;e to go thi|ther; yet he was fearful of having his in|tentions di&s;covered. He pu&s;hed back his chair, then brought it forwards &s;everal times, and was continually looking down, as if for &s;omething on the carpet. "Pretty little Cae&s;ar! &s;weet Pompey!" cried he, &s;peaking to two dogs then in the room. At this time, he held a peach in his hand, which he meant to &s;lip into his pocket, as &s;oon as he could di&s;cover the eyes of my lord and lady attracted by any other object. "Only &s;ee, papa and mamma, (continued he) how prettily they are playing!"</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip replied, that they would not eat one another, he would an&s;wer for it; and having ju&s;t looked at them, put him|&s;elf into his former po&s;ition. Thus poor William, who thought he was &s;ure of then pocketing the peach, was &s;adly di&s;ap|pointed, and obliged to replace it on the table.</P>
<P>The&s;e motions, however, were ob&s;erved by Lady Ru&s;&s;el, who conjectured what were his intentions. She therefore for &s;ometime enjoyed the poor fellow's embarra&s;&s;ments, and made his lord&s;hip acquainted with it by looks and dumb motions.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="047362_0179_1022CEAF244BDEC0">William, who had no idea that his &s;cheme was &s;u&s;pected, being fearful of trying the &s;ame &s;tratagem twice, in&s;tantly thought of another expedient. He took a peach, and placed it in the hollow of his hands both put together, after which he conducted it to his mouth, and made believe as though he was really eating it. Then, while with his left hand he found means to clap his peach into a cavity he had previou&s;ly hollowed in the napkin on his knees, he put his right hand out to reach the other, which he di&s;|po&s;ed of in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, my lord and lady for|got to watch the motions of William, and entered into conver&s;ation on various &s;ubjects. He therefore thought this a proper oppor|tunity to get away, ro&s;e up from table, with both peaches in the napkin, and began to imitate the mewing of a cat, which a young &s;hepherd's boy had lately taught him. His view in this was to engage the attention of Cae&s;ar and Pompey, in which he &s;ucceeded, as they both got up, and jumped about the room.</P>
<P>Lady Ru&s;&s;el was a little angry with him for making &s;uch a noi&s;e, and told him, if he wanted to make &s;uch a mewing as that, the garden was the mo&s;t proper place. Wil|liam
<PB N="175" REF="047362_0180_1022CEB1D5661A88">
pretended to be very much confu&s;ed at this reproof, though the con&s;equence of it was the very thing he wanted. He then in&s;tantly ran up to Cae&s;ar, "See, mamma, (&s;aid William) he wants to bite Pompey!" and as he turned, he dextrou&s;ly &s;lipped the napkin into his pocket, and pretended to run after Cae&s;ar to puni&s;h him. The dog ran towards the door Amelia had left open when &s;he went into the gar|den, and away went William in pur&s;uit of her.</P>
<P>Lady Ru&s;&s;el called William back, and a&s;ked him where he was going. "My dear mamma, (&s;aid he) if you plea&s;e, I will take a turn in the garden, and I hope you will not refu&s;e me that favour." As Lady Ru&s;&s;el did not immediately an&s;wer him, he lowered his voice, and &s;poke in a more &s;uppliant manner. At la&s;t, having obtained her permi&s;&s;ion, away he ran with &s;o much ha&s;te, that his foot &s;lipped, and down he fell; but, luckily, neither he nor the peaches were hurt.</P>
<P>After &s;earching round the garden for his &s;i&s;ter, he at la&s;t found her in the arbour, &s;itting in an attitude of &s;orrow. She was exceedingly unhappy to think &s;he had grieved the three be&s;t friends &s;he had, her
<PB N="176" REF="047362_0181_1022CEB5C3BCD920">
worthy parents, and her dear William. "My &s;weete&s;t Amelia, (&s;aid the little fellow, falling on his knees at the &s;ame time) let us be friends. I would freely a&s;k forgivene&s;s of my fault, had I really in|tended to di&s;plea&s;e you. If you will a&s;k my pardon, I will a&s;k yours al&s;o. My pretty Amelia let us be friends. Here are two nice peaches, which I could not think of eating while you were not pre&s;ent to partake of them."</P>
<P>"Ah, my deare&s;t Billy! (&s;aid Amelia, &s;queezing his hand while &s;he &s;poke, and weeping on his &s;houlder) what a &s;weet good-tempered little fellow you are? Cer|tainly, (continued &s;he, &s;obbing while &s;he &s;poke) tho&s;e that are friends to us in our misfortunes are truly valuable. It was very wrong in me to be &s;o vexed, as I was this morning, about the lo&s;s of a few apples. It was the in&s;ulting look that Mi&s;s Charlotte gave me that was the cau&s;e of it; but I will think of her no more. Will you forgive me? (added &s;he) wiping off the tears &s;he had let fall on William's hand) I confe&s;s that I &s;ometimes love to plague you; but keep your peaches, for I cannot think of eating them."</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="047362_0182_1022CEB86E8D9270">"As to plaguing me, &s;i&s;ter, (an&s;wered William) you may do that as often as you like; but, I a&s;&s;ure you, nobody &s;hall do &s;o but your&s;elf; as to the peaches, I mo&s;t certainly will not eat them. I have already told you &s;o, and my word is like the law of the Medes and Per&s;ians, which altereth not.</P>
<P>"For the very &s;ame rea&s;on, (&s;aid Ame|lia) I &s;hall not eat them," and immediately threw them both over the garden wall; for, be&s;ides her having &s;aid &s;he would not eat them, &s;he could not bear the thought of receiving a bribe to reconcile a quarrel. Amelia's next con&s;ideration was, how to make it up with her mamma, and &s;he &s;aid &s;he &s;hould be happy indeed, if &s;he would but permit her to appear before her, and a&s;k her pardon.</P>
<P>The generous little William no &s;ooner heard the&s;e words, than he promi&s;ed to &s;ettle that bu&s;ine&s;s, and away he in&s;tantly ran; but before he had taken many &s;teps, he &s;topped &s;hort, and turning round, &s;aid, "I will tell mamma, that it was I who made you anger her, by having vexed you in the morning."</P>
<P>Little William &s;ucceeded beyond his expectations, and all parties were &s;oon re|conciled

</FIGURE> THE RIVAL DOGS.</HEAD>
<P>A Gentleman, who&s;e name was How|ard, had brought up two pretty dogs from puppies. The one he called Ca&s;tor, and the other Pollux, hoping they would live in &s;uch friend&s;hip together, as did the two illu&s;trious heroes, after whom they were named. Though they both came from the &s;ame mother, and at the &s;ame time; had been both fed together, and equally treated; yet it was &s;oon &s;een, that
<PB N="180" REF="047362_0185_1022CEC0CC871B88">
there was a great difference in their tempers and di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>Ca&s;tor was of a meek and tractable na|ture; but Pollux was fierce and quarrel|&s;ome. When any per&s;on took notice of the generous Ca&s;tor, he would wag his tail, and jump about for joy, nor was he ever jealous on &s;eeing more notice taken of his brother than of him&s;elf. The &s;urly Pol|lux, on the contrary, whenever Mr. How|ard had him on his lap, would growl and grumble at Ca&s;tor, if he attempted to come near him, or if any one took notice of him.</P>
<P>When any of Mr. Howard's friends hap|pened to come on a vi&s;it to his hou&s;e, and bring their dogs along with them, the good-natured Ca&s;tor would immediately mix among them, and in his way endeavour to amu&s;e them. As he was by nature extremely pliant and engaging, they were all peace and harmony whenever it fell to his lot to entertain them. They would jump and play about the hou&s;e, as boys do in &s;chool when they are left to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The &s;urly Pollux acted a very different part. He would &s;neak into a corner, and bark all day at the &s;trangers. If any of them happened to pa&s;s too near him, he

would then be &s;ure to &s;narl and grin, and would often &s;tart up, and bite their ears or tails. If his ma&s;ter happened to take any notice of either of the &s;trange dogs, on account of their good-nature or hand&s;ome|ne&s;s, Pollux would howl as loud as if thieves were actually breaking into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This odious di&s;po&s;ition of Pollux did not e&s;cape the notice of Mr. Howard, who gradually began to neglect him; while Ca&s;|tor, on the contrary, was every day in|crea&s;ing in his ma&s;ter's favour.</P>
<P>As Mr. Howard was one day &s;itting at table, it &s;uddenly entered his mind to make a more particular trial of the temper of the&s;e two dogs than he had hitherto done. Both happened to be attending at table, but Pollux was neare&s;t his ma&s;ter; for the good-natured Ca&s;tor, in order to avoid &s;trife and contention, always let him chu&s;e his place.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard threw a nice piece of meat to Pollux, which he devoured with much greedine&s;s. Ca&s;tor &s;hewed no &s;igns of un|ea&s;ine&s;s at this, but patiently waited till his ma&s;ter &s;hould think it was his turn. Soon afterwards, Mr. Howard threw Ca&s;tor a bone with hardly any meat on it; but he took it without &s;hewing the lea&s;t mark of di&s;content. The &s;urly Pollux, however,
<PB N="182" REF="047362_0187_1022CEC4FA86BA20">
no &s;ooner &s;aw his brother engaged on his meatle&s;s bone, tho' he had fea&s;ted on his own delicious mor&s;el, than he fell upon him, and took it from him. The good-natured Ca&s;tor made no oppo&s;ition, but gave up the bone without a murmur.</P>
<P>My readers mu&s;t not from hence imagine, that Ca&s;tor was a coward, or was in the lea&s;t afraid of the &s;trength of his brother; for he had lately given &s;ufficient proof of his courage and re&s;olution, in a battle he had been drawn into by Pollux, who&s;e in|tolerable moro&s;ene&s;s had brought on him the vengeance of a neighbouring dog. Pollux, after engaging his antagoni&s;t only a few minutes, though he had provoked the dog to try his &s;trength, ran away like a coward; but Ca&s;tor, in order to cover the retreat of his brother, and without any one to take his part, fought him like a hero, and at la&s;t forced him to run away likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard was well acquainted with this circum&s;tance, and as he had before e&s;|tabli&s;hed his credit, in point of courage, &s;o was his ma&s;ter now fully convinced of his good temper, and the &s;urly and cowardly di&s;po&s;ition of his brother. "My good fellow, (&s;aid Mr. Howard to Ca&s;tor) it is but ju&s;t, that you &s;hould at lea&s;t fare as well
<PB N="183" REF="047362_0188_1022CEC7AD0E3DA0">
as your brother, who does not de&s;erve &s;o much as you." So &s;aying, he cut off a large piece of nice meat, and gave it to Ca&s;tor.</P>
<P>Pollux, &s;eeing &s;o nice a mor&s;el given to his brother, accompanied with &s;uch cutting words from his ma&s;ter, began to growl and &s;narl. "Since you have &s;hewn &s;o much complai&s;ance and genero&s;ity to your brother, (continued Mr. Howard, &s;till &s;peaking to Ca&s;tor) who in return treats you with ill-manners, jealou&s;y, and envy, you &s;hall in future be my own dog, and be at liberty to range about the hou&s;e at your plea&s;ure; but your brother &s;hall be confined in the yard. Here, (cried he) bring a chain for Pollux, and order the carpenter to make him a little hou&s;e!" The order was in|&s;tantly obeyed, and Pollux was led to his kennel, while his brother rambled about at liberty.</P>
<P>Had Pollux received &s;o &s;ingular a mark of favour, he would undoubtedly have &s;upported it with in&s;olence; but Ca&s;tor was of a different di&s;po&s;ition, and appeared very unhappy at his brother's di&s;grace. When|ever any nice bit was given to Ca&s;tor, he would run away with it to Pollux, wag his tail for joy, and invite him to partake of it. In &s;hort, he vi&s;ited him every night in his
<PB N="184" REF="047362_0189_1022CECB8FB00978">
hou&s;e, and did every thing he could to amu&s;e him under his &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e marks of ten|derne&s;s, Pollux always received his brother in the mo&s;t &s;urly manner, howling as though he were come to devour him, and treating him with every mark of di&s;re&s;pect. At length rage and di&s;appointment inflamed his blood, he pined away by degrees, and at la&s;t died a mi&s;erable &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>The moral of this &s;tory is &s;o obvious, that there hardly appears a nece&s;&s;ity to tell my young readers, that &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition as Pollux mu&s;t render its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or an object of contempt and abhorrence, while that of Ca&s;tor will ever be beloved and re&s;pected.</P>

</FIGURE> CLEOPATRA; OR, THE REFORMED LITTLE TYRANT.</HEAD>
<P>A Pert little hu&s;&s;ey, who&s;e name was Cleopatra, was continually teazing and commanding her poor brother. "So, you will not do what I bid you, Mr. Ob&s;ti|nacy! (&s;he would often &s;ay to him) Come, come, Sir, obey, or it &s;hall be the wor&s;e for you."</P>
<P>If Cleopatra's word might be taken for it, her brother did every thing wrong; but,
<PB N="186" REF="047362_0191_1022CECFC1A9E358">
on the contrary, whatever &s;he thought of doing was the ma&s;ter-piece of rea&s;on and &s;ound &s;en&s;e. If he propo&s;ed any kind of diver&s;ion, &s;he was &s;ure to con&s;ider it as dull and in&s;ipid; but it often happened, that &s;he would her&s;elf the next day recommend the &s;ame thing, and having forgotten what &s;he had &s;aid of it before, con&s;ider it as the mo&s;t lively and entertaining.</P>
<P>Her brother was obliged to &s;ubmit to her unaccountable whims and fancies, or el&s;e endure the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable lectures a little female tongue could utter. If ever he pre|&s;umed to be &s;o hardy as to rea&s;on with her on her &s;trange conduct, in&s;tant de&s;truction to his play-things were the inevitable con&s;e|quence of it.</P>
<P>Her parents with regret &s;aw this &s;trange and tyrannical di&s;po&s;ition of their daughter, and in vain did every thing they could think of to break her of it. Her mother, in particular, continually enforced on her mind, that &s;uch children never procured the e&s;teem of others; and that a girl, who &s;et up her own opinion again&s;t that of every one el&s;e, would &s;oon become intolerable and in&s;up|portable to all her acquaintance. This pru|dent advice, however, made no impre&s;&s;ion on her &s;tubborn heart; and her brother,
<PB N="187" REF="047362_0192_1022CED39F131FB8">
wearied out by her caprice and tyranny, began to have very little affection for her. It one day happened, that a gentleman of a free and open temper dined at their hou&s;e. He could not help ob&s;erving with what a haughty air &s;he treated her poor brother, and, indeed, every other per&s;on in the room. At fir&s;t, the rules of politene&s;s kept him from &s;aying any thing; but at la&s;t, tired out with her impertinence, he began ad|dre&s;&s;ing his di&s;cour&s;e to her mamma in the following manner:</P>
<P>"I was lately in France, and, as I was fond of being pre&s;ent at the &s;oldiers exer|ci&s;e, I u&s;ed to go, as often as I could, to &s;ee their manoeuvres on the parade, nearly in the &s;ame manner as they do here at St. James's. Among the &s;oldiers there were many I ob&s;erved with whi&s;kers, which gave them a very fierce and &s;oldier-like look. Now, had I child like your Cleopatra, I would in&s;tantly give her a &s;oldier's uniform, and put on her a pair of whi&s;kers, when &s;he might, with rather more propriety than at pre&s;ent, act the part of a commander."</P>
<P>Cleopatra heard this, and &s;tood covered with confu&s;ion! &s;he could not help blu&s;hing, and was unable to conceal her tears. How|ever this reproach perfectly reformed her,
<PB N="188" REF="047362_0193_1022CED651DC76C8">
and &s;he became &s;en&s;ible how unbecoming was a tyrannizing temper. It has been ob|&s;erved, that to be &s;en&s;ible of our errors is half the work of reformation. So it hap|pened with Cleopatra, who, with the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of her mother's prudent coun&s;els, be|came an amiable girl.</P>
<P>Her reformation was a credit to her; and it is much to be wi&s;hed that all young ladies, who take no pains to conquer their pa&s;&s;ions, would at la&s;t imitate Cleopatra, and wi&s;h to avoid being told, that a &s;oldier's dre&s;s and a pair of whi&s;kers would better become them, than nice cambric frocks and &s;ilk &s;lips. Had Cleopatra attended to the advice of her pa|rents, and not have imagined that greatne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in impertinence, &s;he would have been happy much &s;ooner than &s;he was.</P>

</FIGURE> THE PASSIONATE BOY.</HEAD>
<P>YOUNG Frederick had naturally a no|ble &s;oul, elevated thoughts, and ge|nerous notions. His turn of mind was lively, his imagination &s;trong and quick, and his temper chearful and plea&s;ing. In|deed, the elegance of his per&s;on, and his behaviour and accompli&s;hments, gained him the re&s;pect of every one; but, not|with&s;tanding all the&s;e amiable qualities, he had one unhappy defect, which was that of
<PB N="190" REF="047362_0195_1022CEDBAF9B1A70">
giving way too readily to the mo&s;t violent emotions of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It would frequently happen, that while he was amu&s;ing him&s;elf in the circle of his playmates, the mo&s;t trifling contradiction would ruffle his temper, and fill him with the highe&s;t degree of rage and fury, little &s;hort of a &s;tate of madne&s;s.</P>
<P>As he happened to be one day walking about his chamber, and meditating on the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for a treat his father had permitted him to give his &s;i&s;ter, his dear friend and favourite, Marcus, came to him to advi&s;e with him on that bu&s;ine&s;s. Frederick, being lo&s;t in thought, &s;aw not his friend, who therefore, having &s;poken to him in vain, drew nearer to him, and be|gan to pull him by the &s;leeve. Frederick, angry and out of patience with the&s;e inter|ruptions, &s;uddenly turned round, and gave Marcus &s;uch a pu&s;h, that he &s;ent him reel|ing acro&s;s the room, and he at la&s;t fell again&s;t the wain&s;cot.</P>
<P>Marcus lay motionle&s;s on the floor, with|out the lea&s;t appearance of life; for in his fall, he had &s;truck his head again&s;t &s;ome|thing which had given him a deep and ter|rible wound, from which i&s;&s;ued a great quantity of blood. How &s;hall we de&s;cribe
<PB N="191" REF="047362_0196_1022CEDE96EE50C8">
the &s;ituation of poor Frederick, who loved his friend tenderly, and for whom he would, on occa&s;ion, have &s;acrificed his life!</P>
<P>Frederick fell down be&s;ide him, crying out mo&s;t lamentably, "He is dead! he is dead! I have killed my dear friend Marcus!" So great were his fright and con&s;ternation, that he had no idea of calling for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but lay by his &s;ide uttering the mo&s;t di&s;mal groans. Happily, however, his father heard him, and, in&s;tantly running in, took up Marcus in his arms. He called for &s;ome &s;ugar to &s;top the bleeding of the wound, and having applied &s;ome &s;alts to his no&s;e, and &s;ome water to his temples, they brought him a little to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Frederick was tran&s;ported with joy when he perceived &s;ymptoms of life in his friend; but the fear of relap&s;e kept him in the great|e&s;t anxiety. They immediately &s;ent for a &s;urgeon, who as &s;oon as he arrived, &s;earched the wound. He found it was not in the temple, but &s;o very clo&s;e to it, that the tenth part of an inch nearer, would proba|bly have made the wound dangerous in|deed, if not mortal.</P>
<P>Marcus being carried home, &s;oon became delirious, and Frederick could not be per|&s;uaded to leave him. He &s;at down by the
<PB N="192" REF="047362_0197_1022CEE15C6A8D28">
&s;ide of his poor friend, wholely ab&s;orbed in &s;ilence. Marcus, while he remained in that delirious &s;tate, frequently pronounced the name of Frederick. "My dear Fre|derick, (he would &s;ometimes &s;ay) what could I have done to de&s;erve being treated in this manner? Yet, I am &s;ure, you can|not be le&s;s unhappy than my&s;elf, when you reflect you wounded me without a cau&s;e. However, I would not wi&s;h your generous nature &s;hould be grieved. Let us forgive each other, I for vexing you, and you for wounding me."</P>
<P>In this manner did Marcus talk, without being &s;en&s;ible that Frederick was near him, though he held him by the hand at the &s;ame time. Every word thus pronounced, in which there could be neither flattery nor deceit, went to the heart of the afflicted Frederick, and rendered his grief almo&s;t in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>In ten days time, however, it plea&s;ed God to abate the fever, and he was enabled to get up, to the great joy of his parents; but how can we expre&s;s the feelings of Fre|derick on this happy occa&s;ion! That ta&s;k mu&s;t be left for tho&s;e who may have unfor|tunately been in a &s;imilar &s;ituation: his joy now was undoubtedly as great as his &s;or|rows had been.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="047362_0198_1022CEE40E087BC8">Marcus, at la&s;t, got perfectly well, and Frederick in con&s;equence recovered his for|mer chearfulne&s;s and good-humour. He now &s;tood in need of no other le&s;&s;on, than the &s;orrowful event that had lately taken place, to break him&s;elf of that violence of temper, to which he had been &s;o long a &s;lave. In a little time, no appearance of the wound remained, excepting a &s;mall &s;car near his temple, which Frederick could never look at without &s;ome emotion, even after they were both grown up to manhood. Indeed, it ever afterwards was con&s;idered as a &s;eal of that friend&s;hip, which they never lo&s;t &s;ight of.</P>

</FIGURE> CAROLINE; OR, A LESSON TO CURE VANITY.</HEAD>
<P>A PLAIN white frock had hitherto been the only dre&s;s of Caroline. Sil|ver buckles in her red Morocco &s;hoes; and her ebon hair, which had never felt the tor|turing iron, flowed upon her &s;houlders in graceful ringlets, now and then di&s;turbed by the gentle winds.</P>
<P>Being one day in company with &s;ome little girls, who, though no older than her|&s;elf,
<PB N="195" REF="047362_0200_1022CEE9B8530D58">
were dre&s;&s;ed in all the empty parade of fa&s;hion, the glare and glitter of tho&s;e fine clothes rai&s;ed in her heart a de&s;ire &s;he had never before felt.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he got home, "My dear mamma, (&s;aid &s;he) I have this afternoon &s;een Mi&s;s Flippant and her two &s;i&s;ters, whom you very well know. The elde&s;t is not older than my&s;elf, and yet they were all dre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t elegant manner. Their parents mu&s;t certainly have great plea&s;ure in &s;eeing them &s;o finely dre&s;&s;ed; and, as they are not richer than you, do, my dear mamma, let me have a fine &s;ilk &s;lip, em|broidered &s;hoes like theirs, and let my hair be dre&s;&s;ed by Mr. Frizzle, who is &s;aid to be a very capital man in his profe&s;&s;ion!"</P>
<P>Her mother replied, that &s;he &s;hould have no objection to gratify her wi&s;hes, provided it would add to her happine&s;s; but &s;he was rather fearful it might have a contrary ef|fect. As Mi&s;s Caroline could not give into this mode of thinking, &s;he reque&s;ted her mamma to explain her rea&s;ons for what &s;he had &s;aid.</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e, (&s;aid her mother) you will be in continual fear of &s;potting your &s;ilk &s;lip, and even rumpling it whenever you wear it. A dre&s;s like that of Mi&s;s Flippant will
<PB N="196" REF="047362_0201_1022CEEC68240810">
require the utmo&s;t care and attention to pre|&s;erve it from accidents; for a &s;ingle &s;pot will &s;poil its beauty, and you very well know there is no wa&s;hing of &s;ilks. How|ever exten&s;ive my fortune may be, I a&s;&s;ure you, it is not &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e you &s;ilk gowns &s;o often as you would wi&s;h to have them."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Caroline con&s;idered the&s;e arguments as very trifling, and promi&s;ed to give her mamma no unea&s;ine&s;s as to her carele&s;&s;ne&s;s in wearing her fine clothes. Though her mamma con&s;ented to let her be dre&s;&s;ed in the manner &s;he reque&s;ted, yet &s;he de&s;ired her to remember the hints &s;he had given her of the vexations to which her vanity would expo&s;e her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Caroline, on whom this good advice had no effect, lo&s;t not a moment in de&s;troy|ing all the plea&s;ure and enjoyment of her infancy. Her hair, which before hung down in carele&s;s ringlets, was now twi&s;ted up in paper, and &s;queezed between a burn|ing pair of tongs; that fine jet, which had hitherto &s;o happily &s;et off the whitene&s;s of her forehead, was lo&s;t under a clod of pow|der and pomatum.</P>
<P>In a few days, the mantua-maker arrived with a fine &s;lip of pea-green taffety, with
<PB N="197" REF="047362_0202_1022CEEF17ADC868">
fine pink trimmings, and a pair of &s;hoes, elegantly worked, to an&s;wer the &s;lip. The &s;ight of them gave infinite plea&s;ure to Ca|roline: but it was ea&s;ily to be perceived, when &s;he had them on, that her limbs were under great re&s;traint, and her motions had lo&s;t their accu&s;tomed ea&s;e and freedom. That innocence and candour, which u&s;ed to adorn her lovely countenance, began to be lo&s;t amid&s;t the profu&s;ion of flowers, &s;ilks, gauzes and ribbands.</P>
<P>The novelty, however, of her appear|ance, quite enchanted her. Her eyes, with uncommon eagerne&s;s, wandered over every part of her dre&s;s, and were &s;eldom removed, unle&s;s to take a general &s;urvey of the whole in a pier-gla&s;s. She prevailed on her mamma, to let her &s;end cards of invitation to all her acquaintances, in order to enjoy the inex|pre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure of being gazed at. As &s;oon as they were met, &s;he would walk backwards and forwards before them, like a peacock, and &s;eem to con&s;ider her&s;elf as the empre&s;s of the world, and they as her va&s;&s;als.</P>
<P>All this triumph and con&s;equence, how|ever, met with many mortifying circum|&s;tances. The children, who lived near her, were one day permitted to ramble about the
<PB N="198" REF="047362_0203_1022CEF09C40C1F0">
fields, when Caroline accompanied them, and led the way. What fir&s;t attracted their attention was a beautiful meadow, enamel|led with a variety of charming flowers; and butterflies, who&s;e wings were of va|rious colours, hovered over its &s;urface. The little ladies amu&s;ed them&s;elves with hunting the&s;e butterflies, which they dex|terou&s;ly caught without hurting them; and, as &s;oon as they had examined their beauties, let them fly again. Of the flowers that &s;prung beneath their feet, they made no&s;e|gays, formed in the prettie&s;t ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Though pride would not at fir&s;t permit Mi&s;s Caroline to partake of the&s;e mean amu&s;ements, yet &s;he at la&s;t wanted to &s;hare in the diver&s;ion; but they told her, that the ground might be damp, which would infallibly &s;tain her &s;hoes, and hurt her &s;ilk &s;lip. They had di&s;covered her intention in thus bringing them together, which was only to &s;hew her fine clothes, and they were therefore re&s;olved to mortify her vanity.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Caroline was of cour&s;e under the nece&s;&s;ity of being &s;olitary and inactive, while her companions &s;ported on the gra&s;s without fear of incommoding them&s;elves. The plea&s;ure &s;he had lately taken in view|ing her fine &s;lip and &s;hoes was, at this mo|ment,
<PB N="199" REF="047362_0204_1022CEF47742E578">
but a poor compen&s;ation for the mirth and merriment &s;he thereby lo&s;t.</P>
<P>On one &s;ide of the meadow grew a fine grove of trees, which re&s;ounded with the various notes of innumerable birds, and which &s;eemed to invite every one that pa&s;&s;ed that way to retire thither, and partake of the indulgences of the &s;hade. The little maidens entered this grove, jumping and &s;porting, without fearing any injury to their clothes. Mi&s;s Caroline would have fol|lowed them, but they advi&s;ed her not, tel|ling her, that the bu&s;hes would certainly tear her fine trimmings. She plainly &s;aw that her friends, who were joyou&s;ly &s;port|ing among the trees, were making them|&s;elves merry at her expence, and therefore grew peevi&s;h and ill-humoured.</P>
<P>The younge&s;t of her vi&s;itors, however, had &s;ome &s;ort of compa&s;&s;ion on her. She had ju&s;t di&s;covered a corner, where a quan|tity of fine wild &s;trawberries grew, when &s;he called to Mi&s;s Caroline, and invited her to eat part of them. This &s;he readily at|tempted; but no &s;ooner had &s;he entered the grove, than &s;he was obliged to call out for help. Hereupon the children all gathered to the &s;pot, and found poor Caroline fa&s;tened by the gauze of her hat to a branch of
<PB N="200" REF="047362_0205_1022CEF626DACED0">
white-thorn, from which &s;he could not di&s;|engage her&s;elf. They immediately took out the pins that fa&s;tened her hat; but, to add to her misfortunes, as her hair, which had been frizzled with &s;o much labour, was al&s;o entangled with the branch of white-thorn, it co&s;t her almo&s;t a whole lock, be|fore &s;he could be &s;et at liberty. Thus, in an in&s;tant, was all the boa&s;ted &s;uper&s;truc|ture of her head-dre&s;s put into a &s;tate of confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>After what had pa&s;&s;ed, it cannot be diffi|cult to &s;uppo&s;e in what manner her playmates viewed this accident. In&s;tead of con&s;ola|tion, of which Caroline &s;tood in much need, they could not refrain laughing at the odd figure &s;he made, and did actually torment her with an hundred witty jokes. After having put her a little into order, they quit|ted her in &s;earch of new amu&s;ements, and were &s;oon &s;een at the top of a neighbouring hill.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Caroline found it very difficult to reach this hill; for her fine &s;hoes, that were made very tight, in order to &s;et off her feet the better, greatly retarded her &s;peed. Nor was this the only inconvenience; for her &s;tays were drawn &s;o clo&s;e, that &s;he could not properly breathe. She would very wil|lingly
<PB N="201" REF="047362_0206_1022CEFA0F99CA28">
have gone home to change her dre&s;s, in order to be more at ea&s;e; but &s;he well knew that her friends would not give up their amu&s;ements to plea&s;e her caprice.</P>
<P>Her playmates having reached the &s;um|mit of the hill, enjoyed the beautiful pro&s;|pect that &s;urrounded them on all &s;ides. On one hand were &s;een verdant meadows; on the other the riches of the harve&s;t, with meandring &s;treams that inter&s;ected the fields, and country &s;eats and cottages &s;cattered here and there. So grand a pro&s;pect could not fail of delighting them, and they danced about with joy; while poor Caroline found her&s;elf obliged to remain below, overwhelm|ed with &s;orrow, not being able to get up the hill</P>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;ituation, &s;he had lei&s;ure enough to make the mo&s;t &s;orrowful reflections. "To what purpo&s;e, (&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf) am I dre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e fine cloths? Of what a deal of plea&s;ure do they debar me, and do not all my pre&s;ent &s;ufferings ari&s;e merely from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them?" She was giving up her mind to the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing thoughts, when &s;he &s;uddenly &s;aw her friends come running down the hill, and all crying out together as they pa&s;&s;ed her, " Run, run, Caroline! there is a terrible &s;torm behind
<PB N="202" REF="047362_0207_1022CEFCC6D01078">
the hill, and it is coming towards us! If you do not make ha&s;te, your fine &s;ilk &s;lip will be nicely &s;ou&s;ed!"</P>
<P>The fear of having her &s;lip &s;poiled recal|led her &s;trength; &s;he forgot her wearine&s;s, pinched feet, and tight-laced wai&s;t, and made all the ha&s;te &s;he could to get under cover. In &s;pite of all her efforts, however, &s;he could not run &s;o fa&s;t as her companions, who were not incommoded by their dre&s;&s;es. Every moment produced &s;ome ob&s;tacle to her &s;peed: at one time, by her hoop and flounces in the narrow paths &s;he had to pa&s;s through; at another, by her train, of which the furzes frequently took hold; and at others, by Mon&s;. Pomatum and Powder's fine &s;caffold-work about her head, on which the wind beat down the branches of &s;uch trees as &s;he was obliged, in her progre&s;s home, to pa&s;s under.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, down came the &s;torm with great fury, and hail and rain mixed fell in tor|rents. All her companions were &s;afe at home before it began, and none were ex|po&s;ed to its rage but poor Caroline, who, indeed, got home at la&s;t, but in a mo&s;t di&s;|a&s;trous condition. She had left one of her fine &s;hoes behind her in a large muddy hole, which, in her precipitate flight, &s;he had hurried over without ob&s;erving; and to fill
<PB N="203" REF="047362_0208_1022CEFE4B159DB0">
up the mea&s;ure of her misfortunes, when &s;he had got to the meadow, a &s;udden gu&s;t of wind made free with her hat, and blew it into a pond of &s;tagnated and filthy water.</P>
<P>So completely &s;oaked was every thing &s;he had on, and the heat and rain had &s;o glued her linen to her, that it was with &s;ome difficulty they got her undre&s;&s;ed; as to her &s;ilk &s;lip, it indeed afforded a mi&s;erable &s;pec|tacle of fallen pride and vanity.</P>
<P>Her mother, &s;eeing her in tears, joco&s;ely &s;aid to her, "My dear, &s;hall I have another &s;lip made up for you again&s;t to-morrow?" &mdash;"Oh no, mamma, (an&s;wered Caroline, ki&s;&s;ing her) I am perfectly convinced from experience, that fine clothes cannot add to the happine&s;s of the wearer. Let me again have my nice white frock, and no more pow|der and pomatum till I am at lea&s;t ten years older; for I am a&s;hamed of my folly and vanity."</P>
<P>Caroline &s;oon appeared in her former dre&s;s, and with it &s;he recovered her u&s;ual ea&s;e and freedom, looking more mode&s;t and plea|&s;ing than &s;he ever did in her gaudy finery. Her mamma did not regret the lo&s;s &s;he had &s;u&s;tained in the wreck of the &s;ilk &s;lip, fine &s;hoes, and hat, &s;ince it produced the means of bringing her daughter back to rea&s;on and prudence.</P>

</FIGURE> ARTHUR AND ADRIAN; OR, TWO HEADS BETTER THAN ONE.</HEAD>
<P>ADRIAN had frequently heard his fa|ther &s;ay, that children had but little knowledge with re&s;pect to what was the mo&s;t proper for them; and that the greate&s;t proof they could give of their wi&s;dom, con&s;i&s;ted in following the advice of people, who had more age and experience. This was a kind of doctrine Adrian did not under&s;tand, or at lea&s;t would not, and therefore it is no wonder that he forgot it.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="047362_0210_1022CF050E29DAC0">This wi&s;e and good father had allotted him and his brother Arthur a convenient piece of ground, in order that each might be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a little garden, and di&s;play his knowledge and indu&s;try in the cultiva|tion of it. They had al&s;o leave to &s;ow whatever &s;eed they &s;hould think proper, and to tran&s;plant any tree they liked out of their father's garden into their own.</P>
<P>Arthur remembered tho&s;e words of his father, which his brother Adrian had for|gotten, and therefore went to con&s;ult their gardener Rufus. "Pray tell me, (&s;aid he) what is now in &s;ea&s;on to &s;ow in my garden, and in what manner I am to &s;et about my bu&s;ine&s;s?" The gardener hereupon gave him &s;everal roots and &s;eeds, &s;uch as were propere&s;t for the &s;ea&s;on. Arthur in&s;tantly ran, and put them in the ground, and Ru|fus very kindly, not only a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in the work, but made him acquainted with many things nece&s;&s;ary to be known.</P>
<P>Adrian, on the other hand, &s;hrugged up his &s;houlders at his brother's indu&s;try, think|ing he was taking much more pains than was nece&s;&s;ary. Rufus, not ob&s;erving this con|temptuous treatment, offered him likewi&s;e his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and in&s;truction; but he refu&s;ed it in a manner that &s;ufficiently betrayed his
<PB N="206" REF="047362_0211_1022CF07B977FD88">
vanity and ignorance. He then went into his father's garden, and took from thence a quantity of flowers, which he immediately tran&s;planted into his own. The gardener took no notice of him, but left him to do as he liked.</P>
<P>When Adrian vi&s;ited his garden the next morning, all the flowers he had planted hung down their heads, like &s;o many mourners at a funeral, and, as he plainly &s;aw, were in a dying &s;tate. He replaced them with others from his father's garden; but, on vi&s;iting them the next morning, he found them peri&s;hing like the former.</P>
<P>This was a matter of great vexation to Adrian, who con&s;equently became &s;oon di&s;|gu&s;ted with this kind of bu&s;ine&s;s. He had no idea of taking &s;o much pains for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a few flowers, and therefore gave it up as an unprofitable game. Hence his piece of ground &s;oon became a wilder|ne&s;s of weeds and thi&s;tles.</P>
<P>As he was looking into his brother's gar|den, about the beginning of &s;ummer, he &s;aw &s;omething of a red colour hanging near the ground, which, on examination, he found to be &s;trawberries, of a delicious flavour. "Ah! (&s;aid he) I &s;hould have planted &s;trawberries in my garden."</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="047362_0212_1022CF0940318F80">Some time afterwards, walking again in his brother's garden, he &s;aw little berries of a milk-white colour, which hung down in clu&s;ters from the branches of a bu&s;h. Upon examination, he found they were currants, which even the &s;ight of was a fea&s;t. "Ah! (&s;aid he) I &s;hould have planted currants in my garden."</P>
<P>The gardener then ob&s;erved to him, that it was his own fault that his garden was not as productive as his brother's.

<P>MADAME D'Allone was the gover|ne&s;s of four young ladies, Emilia, Harriot, Lucy, and Sophia, whom &s;he loved with the tenderne&s;s of a mother. Her principal wi&s;h was, that her pupils might be virtuous and happy, and that they might enjoy all the comforts of life with tran|quility. They each experienced an equal &s;hare of her indulgence, and each received the &s;ame treatment, either as to pardon for errors, or rewards, or puni&s;hments.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="047362_0214_1022CF0FCF103F38">Her endeavours were crowned with the happie&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, and her four little girls be|came the &s;weete&s;t children upon earth. They told each other of their faults, and as rea|dily forgave offences; they &s;hared in each other's joys, nor were they ever happy when &s;eparated.</P>
<P>An unfore&s;een event, however, di&s;turbed this happy tranquility, ju&s;t at the very mo|ment they began to ta&s;te its charms, which &s;erved to convince them, how nece&s;&s;ary it was to be guided by their prudent gover|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Madam D'Allone was obliged to leave her pupils for a little time, a family affair having made it nece&s;&s;ary for her to vi&s;it France. She left them with much reluc|tance, even &s;acrificed her intere&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to the de&s;ire of &s;peedily &s;ettling her affairs, and, in the cour&s;e of a month, returned in &s;afety to her little flock, who received her with the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of joy; but the alteration &s;he perceived in her children very much &s;urprized and alarmed her.</P>
<P>She &s;aw it frequently happen, that if one a&s;ked the &s;lighte&s;t favour of another, it was ill-naturedly refu&s;ed, and from thence aro&s;e tumults and quarrels. That gaiety and

chearfulne&s;s, which had u&s;ed to accompany all their &s;ports and pa&s;times, were now changed to a gloomy perver&s;ene&s;s; and, in|&s;tead of tho&s;e tender expre&s;&s;ions of love and friend&s;hip, which had con&s;tantly dwelt in all their conver&s;ations, nothing was now heard but perpetual jarrings and wranglings. If one propo&s;ed a walk in the garden, ano|ther would give &s;ome rea&s;on why &s;he wi&s;hed to remain in her chamber; and, in &s;hort, their only &s;tudy &s;eemed to be to thwart each other.</P>
<P>It happened one day, that not contented with &s;hewing each other how much they de|lighted in perver&s;ene&s;s, they mutually di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves with reciprocal reproaches.</P>
<P>Madame D'Allone beheld this &s;cene with the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, and could not help &s;hedding tears on the occa&s;ion. She did not then think it prudent to &s;ay any thing to them, but retired to her chamber, in order there to think of the propere&s;t means of re&s;toring peace and harmony among her unhappy pupils.</P>
<P>While &s;he was turning the&s;e afflicting thoughts in her mind, all the four young ladies entered her apartment with a peevi&s;h and unea&s;y look, each complaining of the ill-temper of the re&s;t. There was not one

<P>Their governe&s;s put on a very &s;erious countenance, and &s;aid, "I have ob&s;erved, my pupils, that you endeavour to thwart each other, and thereby de&s;troy your plea|&s;ures. In order, therefore, that no &s;uch thing may happen again, let each take up her corner in this room, if &s;he chu&s;e it, and divert her&s;elf in what manner &s;he plea&s;es, provided &s;he does not interfere with either of her &s;i&s;ters. You may immediately have recour&s;e to this mode of recreation, as you have leave to play till night; but remem|ber that neither of you &s;tir from the corner in which I &s;hall place you."</P>
<P>The little maidens, who were no way di&s;|plea&s;ed with this propo&s;al, ha&s;tened to their different quarters, and began to amu&s;e them|&s;elves each in her own way. Sophia com|menced a conver&s;ation with her doll, or ra|ther told her many pretty little &s;tories; but her doll had not the gift of &s;peech, and con&s;equently was no companion. She could not expect any entertainment from her &s;i&s;|ters, as they were playing, each a&s;under, in their re&s;pective corners.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="047362_0217_1022CF17E90EE510">Lucy took her battledore and &s;huttle|cock, but there were none to admire her dexterity; be&s;ides, &s;he was not allowed to &s;trike it acro&s;s the room, as that would have been an inva&s;ion on one of her &s;i&s;ter's terri|tories. She could not expect, that either of them would quit their amu&s;ements to oblige her.</P>
<P>Harriot was very fond of her old game of hunt the &s;lipper; but what was &s;he to do with the &s;lipper by her&s;elf; &s;he could only &s;hove it from hand to hand. It was in vain to hope for &s;uch &s;ervice from her &s;i&s;|ters, as each was amu&s;ing her&s;elf in her a&s;|&s;igned corner.</P>
<P>Emilia, who was a very &s;kilful pretty hou&s;e-wife, was thinking how &s;he might give her friends an entertainment, and of cour&s;e &s;ent out for many things to market; but there was at pre&s;ent nobody near, with whom &s;he might con&s;ult on the occa&s;ion, for her &s;i&s;ters were amu&s;ing them&s;elves each in her corner.</P>
<P>Every attempt they made to find &s;ome new amu&s;ement failed, and all &s;uppo&s;ed that a compromi&s;e would be mo&s;t agreeable; but, as matters were carried &s;o far, who was fir&s;t to propo&s;e it? This each would have con&s;i|dered as a humiliating circum&s;tance; they

therefore kept their di&s;tance, and di&s;dain|fully continued in their &s;olitude. The day at la&s;t clo&s;ing, they returned to Madam D'Allone, and begged her to think of &s;ome other amu&s;ement for them, than the ineffec|tual one they had tried.</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry, my children, (&s;aid their governe&s;s) to &s;ee you all &s;o di&s;contented.

<P>"What you have lo&s;t, or at lea&s;t forgot|ten, (replied Madam D'Allone) is that mu|tual love and friend&s;hip which you once had for each other, and which every &s;i&s;ter ought chearfully to cheri&s;h.

<P>From this time, no idle peevi&s;hne&s;s troubled their harmonious intercour&s;e; and, in&s;tead of bickerings and di&s;contents among them, nothing was &s;een but mutual conde|&s;cen&s;ion, which delighted all who had the opportunity of being in their company.

The wood being young, the trees were con&s;equently &s;mall, and placed very near to each other, with two or three paths between them. As he was one day walking up and down, in order to re&s;t him&s;elf a little, he placed his back again&s;t a tree, who&s;e &s;tem was quite &s;lender, and therefore all its branches &s;hook as &s;oon as it was touched. This ru&s;tling
<PB N="216" REF="047362_0221_1022CF22A8159CA8">
happened to frighten a little bird who &s;prung from a neighbouring bu&s;h, and flew into another part of the wood.</P>
<P>Gregory was vexed to think he had di&s;|turbed the bird, and fixed his eyes upon the bu&s;h, in hopes of &s;eeing it return. While he was thus attentively on the watch, he imagined he &s;aw among the twi&s;ted branches &s;omething like a tuft of hay. As his cu|rio&s;ity was rai&s;ed to know what it was, he went up clo&s;e to the hedge, and found this tuft of hay was hollow, like a bowl. On putting a&s;ide the branches, he &s;aw &s;omething like little balls within it, which were &s;pot|ted, and of an oval &s;hape. They lay clo&s;e to each other, on &s;omething very &s;oft. "Ble&s;s me, (&s;aid Gregory) this mu&s;t be certainly what I have heard &s;ome people call a bird's ne&s;t, and the balls mu&s;t be eggs. They are indeed le&s;s than our eggs, but then our hens are larger than the&s;e birds."</P>
<P>He had &s;ome thoughts, at fir&s;t, of tak|ing away the whole ne&s;t; but, upon &s;econd con&s;ideration, he contented him&s;elf with taking only one of the eggs, with which he in&s;tantly ran home. In the mid&s;t of his ha&s;te, he met his &s;i&s;ter. "See this little egg, (&s;aid he to her) I ju&s;t now found it in a ne&s;t, in which were five others."</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="047362_0222_1022CF25575C3D68">She de&s;ired to have it in her hand, exa|mined it attentively, and then returned it to her brother. At la&s;t they began rolling it up and down a table, ju&s;t as they would a ball. One pu&s;hed it one way and the o|ther a different way, till at la&s;t they pu&s;hed it off the table, when it fell on the floor and broke. This &s;et them a crying, and each mutually accu&s;ed the other of being the cau&s;e of this &s;ad di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>Their mamma happening to hear them cry, came to enquire into the cau&s;e of it, when both began at once telling their &s;or|rows, and having heard their different &s;to|ries, &s;he took them affectionately by the hand, and led them to a tree, who&s;e &s;tately bows afforded a plea&s;ant &s;hade to a verdant bank, on which they all &s;et down together.</P>
<P>"My dear children, (&s;aid their mamma) make your&s;elves ea&s;y. You have broken the egg between you, and that, to be &s;ure, is a misfortune; but it is of too trifling a na|ture to &s;uffer it to make you unhappy. Af|ter all, Gregory there is &s;ome room for com|plaint again&s;t you, as it was an act of inju&s;|tice to rob the poor bird of its egg. You mu&s;t have &s;een how the hen places her eggs in a ne&s;t, on which &s;he &s;its to warm and ani|mate them. In about three weeks from
<PB N="218" REF="047362_0223_1022CF26D9DDBC10">
the eggs proceed chickens, which pierce the the &s;hell, and in a few days come and feed out of your hand. This egg, which you have ju&s;t now broken, had you left it in the ne&s;t, would have become a &s;ort of chick. The bird you &s;aw fly out of the bu&s;h was probably the mother, who will, very like|ly, return again, to &s;ee what mi&s;chief you have done her, and perhaps &s;he will for&s;ake it altogether, which they frequently do when di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>"Though the lo&s;s is only a &s;ingle egg, yet that perhaps will inform them that their habitation is di&s;covered, when they have every thing to be afraid of from our violence. They gue&s;s, that when their little ones &s;hall be hatched, tho&s;e that robbed them of an egg, will return and &s;eize upon their infant family. If this ne&s;t you have been robbing, for I cannot call it any thing le&s;s than a rob|bery, &s;hould be on that account for&s;aken, I think you will be very forry for it."</P>
<P>Gregory replied, that it would indeed give him much unea&s;ine&s;s, and &s;eemed very &s;orry that he had meddled with the egg. "But, (&s;aid he to his mamma) I had not the lea&s;t thought of what you have been telling me, nor did I &s;uppo&s;e there could be any harm in bringing it to my &s;i&s;ter, for it
<PB N="219" REF="047362_0224_1022CF299D9DC598">
was principally on that account that I took it."</P>
<P>His mamma replied that &s;he readily be|lieved him; for &s;he told him &s;he was &s;en&s;i|ble, that he had too good a heart to wi&s;h to do mi&s;chief merely for the &s;ake of tormenting others. Gregory was, indeed, a very good boy, and was as remarkable for his duty to his parents, his tender attachment to his &s;i&s;ter, and his univer&s;al benevolence to eve|ry one.</P>
<P>The little girl ob&s;erved to her mamma, that the ne&s;t which her brother had &s;hewn her, did not, in any degree, re&s;emble the &s;wallow's ne&s;ts that were &s;een about the corners of the windows of &s;ome hou&s;es. "My dear, (replied her mamma) every ne&s;t is not alike, any more than every bird, &s;ome being great, and others little; &s;ome are never &s;een to perch on trees, while others are hardly ever out of them; &s;ome are bul|ky and inactive, others &s;lim, and full of cunning and indu&s;try; the plumage of &s;ome are beautiful beyond de&s;cription, with an amazing variety of colours, and others have a plain and homely appearance; &s;ome &s;ub&s;i&s;t on fruits, &s;ome feed upon in&s;ects, and many live by making a prey of, and devouring the &s;maller birds."</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="047362_0225_1022CF2D97E66C68">Here her little daughter exclaimed, "Oh, what wicked creatures! I am &s;ure I &s;hould think it no crime to de&s;troy the ne&s;ts of &s;uch unnatural birds!"&mdash;"Very true, (replied her mamma) and there are many more of your way of thinking; and therefore the&s;e great birds, who live upon the &s;maller cla&s;s, build their ne&s;ts in places where they can|not be ea&s;ily di&s;turbed, &s;uch as in woods, in crevices of rocks, and in other places mo&s;t unfreqented by men, or at heights beyond our reach.</P>
<P>"Since, therefore, my dear children, the&s;e birds are greatly different from each other, as well in &s;ize as in the mode of liv|ing, and in the variety of their plumage, it will naturally follow, that their ne&s;ts mu&s;t al&s;o differ. The lark never perches on a tree, and &s;ings only when mounting in the air, and builds her ne&s;t on the ground. The &s;wal|low builds about the roofs of hou&s;es, under what we call the eyes, and &s;ometimes in the corners of windows. The owl, who flies abroad only in the night, &s;eeks out de&s;erted habitations, or &s;ome hollow tree, wherein to depo&s;it her eggs; and the eagles, who &s;oar above the clouds till ab&s;olutely out of &s;ight, bring forth their young in the cliffs of craggy rocks.

<P>"We will, one fine day, take a walk into the little valley that terminates our large meadow, and you will there &s;ee a number of the&s;e pretty creatures bu&s;y in &s;electing the materials, of which they compo&s;e their ne&s;ts. You will ob&s;erve one employed in carrying off a wheaten &s;traw, another with wool or feathers in its beak, another with a dried leaf, and perhaps with a little mo&s;s. You may frequently notice the &s;wallow, on the borders of a limped &s;tream, moi&s;tening in the water a little bit of earth which he holds in his beak, and with this he builds his habitation; and, though the out&s;ide of its ne&s;t is formed of hard and durable mate|rials, the in&s;ide is lined with the &s;ofte&s;t and warme&s;t. There are even &s;ome birds, who pull off their own feathers to make up a comfortable bed, wherein to &s;ecure their young from every inclemency of the ele|ments.</P>
<P>"Their ne&s;ts are made large or &s;mall, in proportion to the number of eggs they are

to contain. Some birds hang up their ne&s;ts by a kind of thread, which they have the &s;kill to form of flax, of different &s;orts of weeds, and of the webs of &s;piders. O|thers place it in the middle of a &s;oft and gluey &s;ub&s;tance, to which they carefully &s;tick many feathers. All birds &s;eek retired and &s;olitary places, and u&s;e every endea|vour to make their ne&s;ts &s;trong and &s;olid, to &s;ecure them from the attacks of enemies of various &s;pecies.</P>
<P>"It is in this kind of habitation they lay their eggs, where the mother, and at times the father, &s;its upon them, puts every thing within them into motion, and at la&s;t produ|ces little creatures, who break through their &s;hell, and come forth.</P>
<P>"I doubt not but you have often &s;een a fly in winter, which appeared to have no life in it; yet, upon taking it into your hand, the warmth proceeding from it has brought it to life. It is nearly the &s;ame thing with birds, the per&s;everance of who&s;e parents, in brooding upon their eggs, con|verts them into living creatures.</P>
<P>"While the mother is &s;itting, the cock is her con&s;tant attendant, and amu&s;es her her with his mu&s;ic. When the young birds are hatched, the old ones endeavour to re|lea&s;e

them from the confinement of the egg. At this period, their diligence is redoub|led, they do every thing to nouri&s;h and defend them, and are con&s;tantly employed in that intere&s;ting pur&s;uit. No di&s;tance de|ters them from &s;eeking their food, of which they make an equal di&s;tribution, every one receiving in his turn what they have been enabled to procure. So long as they con|tinue young and helple&s;s, they contrive to procure &s;uch food as is adapted to their deli|cacy; but as &s;oon as they are grown &s;tron|ger by age, they provide for them food of a more &s;olid nature.</P>
<P>"The pelican, which is a very large bird, is obliged to go a great di&s;tance for food for its young, and therefore nature has provid|ed it with a &s;ort of bag, which &s;he fills with &s;uch food as &s;he knows is mo&s;t agreeable to the palate of her young ones. She warms what &s;he procures, and by &s;uch means makes it fitter for their tender &s;tomachs.</P>
<P>"While they are thus acting the parental part, they &s;eem to be forgetful of them|&s;elves, and attentive only to their little fa|mily. On the approach of either rain or tempe&s;ts, they ha&s;ten to their ne&s;ts, and cover it as well as they can with expanded wings, thereby keeping out the wind and

water from hurting their infant brood. All their nights are employed in nouri&s;hing and keeping them warm. The mo&s;t timerous among the feathered race, who will fly away on the lea&s;t noi&s;e that approaches them, and tremble at the mo&s;t trifling apprehen&s;ions of danger, become &s;trangers to fear as &s;oon as they have a young family to take care of, and are in&s;pired with courage and in|trepidity. We &s;ee an in&s;tance of this in the common hen, who, though in general a coward, no &s;ooner becomes a parent, than &s;he gives proofs of courage, and boldly &s;tands forth in defence of her young. She will face the large&s;t dog, and will not run even from a man who &s;hall attempt to rob her of her young.</P>
<P>"In nearly a &s;imilar manner, the little birds endeavour to protect their infant fa|mily. When an enemy approaches, they will flutter round the ne&s;t, will &s;eem to call out for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will attack the invader, and pur&s;ue him. The mother will fre|quently prefer confining her&s;elf with them to the plea&s;ure of rambling through the woods, and will not quit her little progeny."</P>

</FIGURE> THE COVETOUS BOY.</HEAD>
<P>YOUNG Samuel was the only &s;on of a capital merchant, and was tenderly beloved by his father. He had by no means a bad heart, his countenance was plea&s;ing, and his friends would all have been very fond of him, had he not &s;hewn, in every part of his conduct, a covetous pro|pen&s;ity that eclip&s;ed all his accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>His covetous di&s;po&s;ition made him wi&s;h for every thing he &s;aw others po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and even carried him to &s;o great a length,
<PB N="227" REF="047362_0232_1022CF40B574F3A8">
that he would not &s;hare among his playmates any thing he had, or, even let them &s;ee it.</P>
<P>It was with little Samuel as it generally is with every body el&s;e, that he lo&s;t more than he gained by his avarice. If any body gave him any &s;weet-meats, he would get into &s;ome private corner of the hou&s;e, and there &s;wallow them, for fear any of his ac|quaintances &s;hould want part of them. His father, in order to cure him of his greedy di&s;po&s;ition, u&s;ed while he was fea&s;ting in private, to give a double portion to his companions He perceived this, and there|fore left off hiding him&s;elf; but he no &s;oon|er fixed his eyes on any nicety, than he ap|peared ready to devour it at once, and pur|&s;ued the hand of tho&s;e that held it, as a vulture does its prey.</P>
<P>From what has been already &s;aid, his father may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be much hurt at this conduct; and, in order to &s;ave him&s;elf as much vexation as po&s;&s;ible, he cea&s;ed to give him any more niceties, or even have them within his hou&s;e, &s;o that they might not, at any rate, be within the reach of his voracious &s;on.</P>
<P>If Samuel had a plea&s;ing toy of any kind, he would never &s;hew it, but concealed him|&s;elf in the enjoyment of it, without ever
<PB N="228" REF="047362_0233_1022CF4365E15B70">
being happy. If he had any &s;ort of fruit, he would not &s;hare it with his playmates, but devour it in private, even refu&s;ing any to tho&s;e he happened to love mo&s;t. Con|&s;equently, none of his playmates would e|ver give him a part of what they had, and &s;eemed always de&s;irous of &s;huning his company. When he chanced to be engag|ed in a quarrel with any one, none appear|ed ready to take his part, not even when they knew him to be in the right; and, when he was in the wrong, every one joined again&s;t him.</P>
<P>It one day happened, that a little boy ob&s;erved him with an apple in his hand, and gave him by &s;urpri&s;e a knock on the elbow, which made him let the apple fall. How|ever, he picked it up ha&s;tily, and in order to revenge him&s;elf on the boy, &s;et off to catch him; but, in running, fell into a hog-pond, and had like to have been &s;uffocated in the &s;oil, He exerted all his power to get out, but to no effect; he endeavoured, but with|out &s;ucceeding, to prevail on his playmates to take hold of his hand and help him out.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, they laughed at his di&s;tre&s;s, and joyou&s;ly danced about the pond, from which he could not relieve him|&s;elf. They told him to a&s;k the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
<PB N="229" REF="047362_0234_1022CF46143D4E10">
tho&s;e, to whom he had done the lea&s;t kind|ne&s;s; but, among all his playmates, there was not one, who&s;e help he could demand on that &s;core. At la&s;t, one of the boys, who took pity on him, came forward and gave him his hand, when he &s;afely got out.</P>
<P>Samuel &s;hook off the mud as well as he could, and then, to &s;hew his gratitude to the little boy who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, he bit off about a quarter of the apple which had cau&s;ed this di&s;a&s;ter, and which he never let go, and de&s;ired him to accept of it. But the boy, di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;o pitiful a gift, took the mor&s;el, and then flung it in his face; and this &s;erved as a &s;ignal for all the boys to &s;cout him. They pur&s;ued Samuel quite home, hooting him all the way he went.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t time he had ever been hooted, and, as he did not want for feeling, it threw him into the depth of thought. He kept out of his father's pre&s;ence, and confined him&s;elf to his room for &s;ome days. There he rea&s;oned with him&s;elf on the cau&s;e that could produce &s;uch treatment from his playfellows. "For what rea&s;on, (&s;aid he to him&s;elf) could my little neighbour, who even lent me his hand to get out of the pond, throw the apple in my face, and &s;et the boys to hoot me? Why has he &s;o many good friends, while I have not a &s;ingle one?"</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="047362_0235_1022CF4796BFF598">On comparing the good boy's behaviour, with his own he &s;oon di&s;covered the rea&s;on. To become &s;en&s;ible of our errors is half the work of reformation. He recollected, that he had ob&s;erved his friend was always ready to help every one; that, whenever he had any fruit, confectionary, or the like, he &s;eemed to feel more plea&s;ure in &s;haring it with his companions, than in eating it him|&s;elf, and had no kind of amu&s;ement in which he did not wi&s;h every one to bear a part. On this &s;hort review of circum&s;tan|ces he plainly perceived, wherein lay the difference between him&s;elf and this little good boy. He at la&s;t re&s;olved to imitate him; and the next day, filling his pockets with fruit, he ran up to every boy he met, and gave him a part of it, but he could not, on a &s;udden, give up <HI>&s;elf,</HI> having left a lit|tle in his pocked to eat at home in private.</P>
<P>Though it is evident, that he had not yet completely conquered his avarice, yet he was not a little plea&s;ed with the advan|ces he had made &s;ince his companions were now, on their part, more generous to him; they &s;hewed them&s;elves much more &s;atisfied with his company, and admitted him a partner in all their little pa&s;times; they di|vided with him whatever they happened to
<PB N="231" REF="047362_0236_1022CF4B74985B00">
have, and he always went home plea&s;ed and &s;ati&s;fied.</P>
<P>Soon after, he made a &s;till greater pro|gre&s;s in conquering his &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition; for he pulled out of his pocket every thing he had, and divided it into as many &s;hares as there were mouths to eat it, without re|&s;erving any more than an equal part for him&s;elf. Indeed, it was the general opi|nion of the boys, that his own &s;hare was the lea&s;t. This day he was much more &s;a|tisfied than before, and went home gay and chearful.</P>
<P>By pur&s;uing this conduct, he &s;oon ac|quired a generous habit, and became liberal even to tho&s;e who had nothing to give in return. He con&s;equently acquired the love and e&s;teem of his companions, who no &s;ooner &s;aw him than they ran to meet him with joyful countenances, and made his plea&s;ure their own. Thus, in&s;tead of be|ing mi&s;erable and wretched through avarice, he became completely happy in the practice of genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>His father was undoubtedly highly plea&s;ed with this change, and tenderly embracing him, promi&s;ed to refu&s;e him nothing in fu|ture that might add to his plea&s;ure and de|light. Samuel hereby learned in what true happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts.</P>

hundred pounds, in order that he might open &s;hop in a proper &s;tile.</P>
<P>It will from hence naturally follow, that Humphries thought him&s;elf one of the hap|pie&s;t men in the world. He &s;uppo&s;ed his warehou&s;e already filled with goods, he reckoned how many cu&s;tomers would croud to buy them, and what would be his profits thereon.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e extravagant flights of fancy, he perceived an alehou&s;e. "Come, (&s;aid he, on entering it) I will indulge my|&s;elf with &s;pending one &s;ixpence of this mo|ney." He he&s;itated, however, &s;ome few moments, about calling for punch, which was his favourite liquor, as his con&s;cience loudly told him, that his time for enjoyment ought to be at &s;ome di&s;tance, and not till he had paid his friend the money he had bor|rowed; that it would not be hone&s;t in him, at pre&s;ent, to &s;pend a farthing of that money but in ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;aries. With the&s;e right ideas he was nearly leaving the ale|hou&s;e; but, bethinking him&s;elf, on the other hand, that if he &s;pent a &s;ixpence of his mo|ney, he &s;hould &s;till have an hundred pounds all but that &s;ixpence, that &s;uch a &s;um was fully &s;ufficient to &s;et him up in trade, and that a &s;ingle half-hour's indu&s;try would am|ply

make amends for &s;uch a trifling plea&s;ure as he wi&s;hed then to enjoy.</P>
<P>He called for his punch, and the fir&s;t gla&s;s bani&s;hed all his former qualms, little think|ing that &s;uch a conduct would, by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, open a way to his ruin. The next day, he recollected the plea&s;ures of the for|mer gla&s;s, and found it ea&s;y to reconcile his con&s;cience to the &s;pending of another &s;ix|pence. He knew he &s;hould &s;till have an hundred pounds left all but one &s;hilling.</P>
<P>The love of liquor had at la&s;t completely conquered him, and every &s;ucceeding day he con&s;tantly returned to his favourite ale|hou&s;e, and gradually increa&s;ed his quantity, till he &s;pent two &s;hillings and &s;ixpence at each &s;itting. Here he &s;eemed to make a &s;tand, and every time he went he con&s;oled him&s;elf with &s;aying, that he was &s;pending only half-a-crown, and that he need not fear but he &s;hould have enough to carry on his trade.</P>
<P>By this delu&s;ive way of rea&s;oning, he &s;i|lenced the prudent whi&s;pers of con&s;cience, which would &s;ometimes, in &s;pite even of liquor, break in upon him, and remind him, that the proper u&s;e of money con&s;i&s;ted in prudently applying every part of it to ad|vantageous purpo&s;es.</P>

This reduced her to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling all her furniture, and the greater part of her jewels. The produce of the&s;e were placed
<PB N="242" REF="047362_0247_1022CF6870C3A868">
in the hands of a banker, and retired to a village, where &s;he could live much cheaper than in the metropolis, and with tolerable decency.</P>
<P>She had not pa&s;&s;ed more than two months in this retreat, when information was brought her, that her banker had failed in trade, and con&s;equently all her money was lo&s;t. Judge what mu&s;t be the horrors of her &s;ituation! Sickne&s;s and grief had &s;o debilitated her con&s;titution, that &s;he was unable to do any kind of work, whereby to procure a &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence; and, after having pa&s;&s;ed her youth in ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, &s;he had no re&s;ources left in the evening of her life, but that of a workhou&s;e, or common beggary.</P>
<P>Not one of her acquaintance would &s;ee her, nor conde&s;cend to take the lea&s;t intere&s;t in her &s;ufferings. Being brought by her hu&s;band from a foreign country, &s;he had no friends to fly to for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, except a di&s;tant relation, whom &s;he had brought with her to England, and who, by her hu&s;band's credit, gained great riches; but this man's avarice was greater than his wealth, and there was little charity to be expected from a man, who denied him&s;elf the common nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>Afflicted virtue, however, always finds
<PB N="243" REF="047362_0248_1022CF6C949AAC68">
re&s;ource in the bounteous hands of Provi|dence, and &s;he found the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence where &s;he little expected it. In the former days of her pro&s;perity, &s;he had a|dopted a female orphan, who&s;e name was Clari&s;&s;a, who now became her guardian and protector. Clari&s;&s;a had a grateful heart: &s;he wept for the misfortunes of her friend, but &s;he rejoiced at the thoughts of having an opportunity to &s;hew her gratitude.</P>
<P>When Dorinda mentioned her de&s;ign of &s;eeking refuge in a pari&s;h workhou&s;e, "No, (&s;aid Clari&s;&s;a) you &s;hall never leave me. From your tenderne&s;s I formerly received the indulgences of a beloved child; and, if in your pro&s;perity I thought my&s;elf happy in the idea of being &s;o nearly related to you, by adoption, I &s;till think it more &s;o now I &s;ee you in adver&s;ity. Thank Heaven and your adoption for my comfortable &s;ituation! your maternal conduct was amply di&s;played in teaching me all the nece&s;&s;ary female arts; and I am happy in the reflection, that I can make u&s;e of my knowledge for your &s;ake. With health and courage, I fear not being able to procure for us both at lea&s;t a com|fortable living."</P>
<P>This generous offer exceedingly affected the unhappy widow, who embraced Clari&s;&s;a,
<PB N="244" REF="047362_0249_1022CF6F43EB4BC0">
and with joy accepted of her propo&s;al. This amiable girl, in her turn, became the mother, by adoption, of her former bene|factre&s;s. Not content with feeding her with the produce of an unremitted labour, &s;he con&s;oled her affliction, attended her in &s;ickne&s;s, and endeavoured, by the tendere&s;t methods, to &s;often the iron hand of For|tune.</P>
<P>For two years did the con&s;tancy and ar|dour of Clari&s;&s;a continued with unwearied attention, and her only happine&s;s &s;eemed to con&s;i&s;t in promoting that of her friend. At the end of that period, when death relieved the unhappy Dorinda from the cares and troubles of this life, &s;he &s;incerely lamented her death, and bewailed it as a grievous misfortune.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after died al&s;o the relation of Dorinda, of whom we have lately &s;poken, and who had &s;hewn him&s;elf &s;o &s;hamefully in&s;en&s;ible to every claim of gratitude and kindred. As he could not carry his riches with him, he &s;uppo&s;ed it would be making &s;ome atonement for his ungenerous conduct, by leaving the injured Dorinda every thing he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Alas! it came too late, for &s;he was no more!</P>
<P>The amiable Dorinda had not, before her
<PB N="245" REF="047362_0250_1022CF71F2AACF58">
death, the con&s;olation of knowing that &s;uch a change had happened in her fortune, as in that ca&s;e &s;he might have ea&s;ily turned it to the advantage of the generous Clari&s;&s;a. This large fortune, therefore, for want of an heir, fell to the king; but Providence &s;o directed it, that the generous conduct of the orphan to her benefactre&s;s reached the ears of the prince. "Ah! then, (&s;aid he) &s;he merits this inheritance! I renounce my right in her favour, and &s;hall be happy in being her father and friend."</P>
<P>This generous act of the king was ap|plauded by the whole nation; and Clari&s;&s;a, having thus received &s;o glorious a reward for her gratitude, employed it in the main|tenance of orphans, &s;uch as &s;he her&s;elf had been. It was the &s;ummit of her delight, to in&s;pire them with &s;entiments &s;imilar to tho&s;e &s;he her&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>

</FIGURE> RETURNING GOOD FOR EVIL, THE NO|BLEST REVENGE.</HEAD>
<P>"I WILL be revenged of him, that I will, and make him heartily repent it," &s;aid little Philip to him&s;elf, with a coun|tenance quite red with anger. His mind was &s;o engaged, that as he walked along, he did no &s;ee his dear friend, Stephen, who happened at that in&s;tant to meet him, and con&s;equently heard what he had &s;aid.</P>
<P>"Who is that, (&s;aid Stephen) that you intend to be revenged on?" Philip, as
<PB N="247" REF="047362_0252_1022CF7757BB2E18">
though awakened from a dream, &s;topped &s;hort, and looking at his friend, &s;oon re|&s;umed the &s;mile that was natural to his countenance. "Ah! (&s;aid he) come with me, my friend, and you &s;hall &s;ee whom I will be revenged on. I believe you remem|ber my &s;upple jack, a very pretty little cane, which my father gave me. You &s;ee it is now all in pieces. It was farmer Robin&s;on's &s;on, who lives in yonder thatched cottage, that reduced it to this worthle&s;s &s;tate."</P>
<P>Stephen very coolly a&s;ked him, what in|duced the farmer's &s;on to break it. "I was walking very peaceably along, (replied Philip) and was playing with my cane, by twi&s;ting it round my body. By &s;ome acci|dent or other, one of the two ends got out of my hand when I was oppo&s;ite to the gate ju&s;t by the wooden bridge, and where the little mi&s;creant had put down a pitcher full of water, which he was carrying home from the well. It &s;o happened, that my cane, in &s;pringing, over&s;et the pitcher, but did not break it. He came up clo&s;e to me, and began to call me names, when I a&s;&s;ured him I did not intend any harm, what I had done was by accident, and I was very &s;orry for it. Without paying any regard to what I &s;aid, he in&s;tantly &s;eized my &s;upple jack, and
<PB N="248" REF="047362_0253_1022CF7A08B245C8">
twi&s;ted it as you hear &s;ee; but I will make him heartily repent it."</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure, (&s;aid Stephen) he is a very wicked boy, and is already very properly puni&s;hed for it, &s;ince nobody likes him, nor will do any thing for him. He finds it very difficult to get any companion to play with him, and if he attempts to intrude him&s;elf into their company, they will all in&s;tantly leave him. To con&s;ider this properly, I think, &s;hould be &s;ufficient revenge for you."</P>
<P>"All this is true, (replied Philip) but he has broken my cane. It was a pre&s;ent from my papa, and a very pretty cane you know it was. My father will perhaps a&s;k me what is become of it; and, as he will &s;up|po&s;e I have carele&s;sly lo&s;t his pre&s;ent, he will probably be angry with me, of which this little &s;aucy fellow will be the cau&s;e. I offered to fill his pitcher again, having knocked it down by accident&mdash;I will be revenged."</P>
<P>"My dear friend, (&s;aid Stephen) I think you will act better in not minding him, as your contempt will be the be&s;t puni&s;hment you can inflict on him. He is not upon a level with you, and you may be a&s;&s;ured that he will always be able to do more mi&s;chief to you, than you would chu&s;e to do him. And
<PB N="249" REF="047362_0254_1022CF7CC1D2DF88">
now I think of it, I will tell you what hap|pened to him not long &s;ince.</P>
<P>"Very unluckily for him, he chanced to &s;ee a bee hovering about a flower, which he caught; and was going to pull off its wings out of &s;port, when the animal found means to &s;ting him, and then flew away in &s;afety to the hive. The pain put him into a mo&s;t furious pa&s;&s;ion, and, like you, he vowed to take a &s;evere revenge. He accordingly pro|cured a little hazle &s;tick, and thru&s;t it thro' a hole into the bee-hive, twi&s;ting it about therein. By the&s;e means, he killed &s;everal of the little animals; but, in an in&s;tant, all the &s;warm i&s;&s;ued out, and falling upon him, &s;tung him in a thou&s;and different places. You will naturally &s;uppo&s;e that he uttered the mo&s;t piercing cries, and rolled upon the ground in the exce&s;s of his agony. His father ran to him, but could not, without the greate&s;t difficulty, put the bees to flight, after having &s;tung him &s;o &s;everely, that he was confined &s;everal days to his bed.</P>
<P>"Thus, you &s;ee, he was not very &s;ucce&s;s|ful in his pur&s;uit of revenge. I would ad|vi&s;e you therefore to pa&s;s over his in&s;ult, and leave others to puni&s;h him, without your taking any part in it. Be&s;ides, he is a wicked boy, and much &s;tronger than you
<PB N="250" REF="047362_0255_1022599806C4FC88">
are; &s;o that your ability to obtain revenge may be doubtful."</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t own, (replied Philip) that your advice &s;eems very good. So come along with me, and I will go and tell my father the whole matter, and I think he will not be angry with me. It is not the cane that I value on any other con&s;ideration than that it was my fa|ther's pre&s;ent, and I would wi&s;h to convince him that I take care of every thing he gives me." He and his friend then went toge|ther, and Philip told his father what had happened, who thanked Stephen for the good advice he had given his &s;on, and gave Philip another cane exactly like the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>A few days afterwards, Philip &s;aw this ill-natured boy fall as he was carrying home a very heavy load of wood, which he could not get up again. Philip ran to him, and replaced it on his &s;houlder.</P>
<P>Young Robin&s;on was quite a&s;hamed at the thought of having received this kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance from a youth he had treated &s;o badly, and heartily repented of his beha|viour. Philip went home quite &s;atisfied, to think he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted one he did not love, and from pure motives of tenderne&s;s and humanity. "This, (&s;aid he) is the noble&s;t vengeance I could take, in returning good for evil."</P>

</FIGURE> GREY HAIRS MADE HAPPY.</HEAD>
<P>OPPOSITE to the hou&s;e, in which Charlotte's parents lived, was a little opening, ornamented with a gra&s;s-plot, and over&s;haded by a venerable tree, command|ing an exten&s;ive view before it. On this delightful &s;pot, Charlotte u&s;ed frequently to &s;it in her little chair, while employed in knitting &s;tockings for her mamma.</P>
<P>As &s;he was one day thus employed, &s;he &s;aw a poor old man advancing very &s;lowly
<PB N="252" REF="047362_0257_1022CF80F87F93C8">
towards her. His hair was as white as &s;ilver, and his back bent with age; he &s;upported him&s;elf by a &s;tick, and &s;eemed to walk with great difficulty. "Poor man, (&s;aid Char|lotte), looking at him mo&s;t tenderly) he &s;eems to be very much in pain, and per|haps is very poor, which are two dreadful evils!"</P>
<P>She al&s;o &s;aw a number of boys, who were following clo&s;e behind this poor old man. They pa&s;&s;ed jokes upon his threadbare coat, which had very long &s;kirts, and &s;hort &s;leeves, contrary to the fa&s;hion of tho&s;e days. His hat, which was quite ru&s;ty, did not e&s;cape their notice; his cheeks were hollow and his body thin. The&s;e wicked boys no &s;ooner &s;aw him, than they all bur&s;t out a laughing. A &s;tone lay in his way, which he did not perceive, and over it he &s;tumbled, and had like to have fallen. This afforded them &s;port, and they laughed loudly; but it gave great pain to the poor old man, who uttered a deep &s;igh.</P>
<P>"I once was as young as you are, (&s;aid he to the boys) but I did not laugh at the infirmities of age as you do. The day will come in which you will be old your&s;elves, and every day is bringing you forward to that period. You will then be &s;en&s;ible of
<PB N="253" REF="047362_0258_1022CF851165CBE0">
the impopriety of your pre&s;ent conduct." Having thus &s;poken, he endeavoured to hobble on again, and made a &s;econd &s;tum|ble, when in &s;truggling to &s;ave him&s;elf from falling, he dropped his cane, and down he fell. On this the wicked boys renewed their laugh, and highly enjoyed his misfor|tune.</P>
<P>Charlotte, who had &s;een every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed, could not help pitying the old man's &s;ituation, and therefore putting down her &s;tocking on the chair, ran towards him, picked up the cane and gave it him, and then taking hold of his other arm, as if &s;he had been as &s;trong as a woman, advi&s;ed him to lean upon her, and not mind any thing the boys might &s;ay to him.</P>
<P>The poor old man looking at her very earne&s;tly, "Sweet child, (&s;aid he) how good you are! This kindne&s;s makes me in a moment forget all the ill behaviour of tho&s;e naughty boys. May you ever be happy." They then walked on together; but the boys being probably made a&s;hamed of their conduct by the behaviour of Char|lotte, followed the old man no further.</P>
<P>While the boys were turning about, one of them fell down al&s;o, and all the re&s;t be|gan laughing, as they had before done at the old man. He was very angry with
<PB N="254" REF="047362_0259_1022CF87C750E8D8">
them on that account. and as &s;oon as he got up, ran after his companions, pelting them with &s;tones. He in&s;tantly became convinced, how unju&s;t it was to laugh at the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of another, and formed a re&s;o|lution, for the future, never to laugh at any per&s;on's pain. He followed the old man he had been laughing at, though at &s;ome di&s;tance, wi&s;hing for an opportunity to do him &s;ome favour, by way of atone|ment, for what he had done.</P>
<P>The good old man, in the mean time, by the kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Charlotte, proceeded with &s;low but &s;ure &s;teps. She a&s;ked him to &s;top and re&s;t him&s;elf a little, and told him, that her hou&s;e was that before him. "Pray &s;tay, (&s;aid &s;he) and &s;it a little under that large tree. My parents, indeed, are not at home, and therefore you will not be &s;o well treated; yet it will be a little re&s;t to you."</P>
<P>The old man accepted Charlotte's offer. She brought him out a chair, and then fetched &s;ome bread and chee&s;e and good &s;mall beer, which was all the pretty maid could get at. He thanked her very kindly, and then entered into conver&s;ation with her.</P>
<P>"I find, my dear, (&s;aid he) you have pa|rents. I doubt not but you love them, and
<PB N="255" REF="047362_0260_10225994C5216678">
they love you. They mu&s;t be very happy, and may they always continue to be &s;o!"</P>
<P>"And pray, good old man, (&s;aid Char|lotte) I &s;uppo&s;e you have got children."&mdash; "I had a &s;on (replied he) who lived in Lon|don, loved me tenderly, and frequently came to &s;ee me; but, alas! he is now dead, and I am left di&s;con&s;olate. His widow, in|deed, is rich; but &s;he a&s;&s;umes the character of the lady, and thinks it beneath her to enquire whether I be dead or living, as &s;he does not wi&s;h it to be known, that her hu&s;|band's father is a pea&s;ant."</P>
<P>Charlotte was much affected, and could hardly believe that &s;uch cruel people exi&s;ted. "Ah! certain I am, (&s;aid &s;he) that my dear mother would not behave &s;o cruelly." He then ro&s;e and thanked Charlotte with a ble&s;&s;ing; but &s;he was determined not to leave him, till &s;he had accompanied him a little way further.</P>
<P>As they walked on, they &s;aw the little boy who had been following them; for he run on &s;ome way before, and was then &s;it|ting on the gra&s;s. When they looked upon him he ca&s;t his eyes downwards, got up af|ter they had pa&s;&s;ed, and followed them again. Charlotte ob&s;erved him, but &s;aid nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="047362_0261_1022CF8D2B3C38D8">She a&s;ked the old man if he lived alone. "No little lady, (an&s;wered he) I have a cottage on the other &s;ide of that meadow, &s;eated in the middle of a little garden, with an orchard and a &s;mall field. An old neigh|bour, who&s;e cottage fell down through age, lives with me, and cultivates my ground. He is an hone&s;t man, and I am perfectly ea&s;y in his &s;ociety; but the lo&s;s of my &s;on &s;till bears hard upon me, nor have I the happine&s;s to &s;ee any of his children, who mu&s;t by this time have forgotten me."</P>
<P>The&s;e complaints touched the heart of Charlotte, who told him, that &s;he and her mother would come and &s;ee him. The &s;en|&s;ibility and kindne&s;s of this little girl, &s;erved only to aggravate his grief, by bringing to his mind the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained in his &s;on. Tears came in his eyes, when he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe them; and, in&s;tead of again putting it into his pocket, in the agitation of his mind, it &s;lipped a&s;ide, and fell unnoticed by him or Charlotte.</P>
<P>The little boy who followed them, &s;aw the handkerchief fall, ran to pick it up, and gave it the old man, &s;aying, "Here, good old man, you dropped your handker|chief, and here it is."&mdash;"Thank you hear|tily, my little friend, (&s;aid the old man).
<PB N="257" REF="047362_0262_1022CF900024C9F8">
Here is a good-natured lad, who does not ridicule old age, not laugh at the afflictions that attend it." You will certainly become an hone&s;t man. Come both of you to my habitation, and I will give you &s;ome milk." They had no &s;ooner reached the old man's cottage than he brought out &s;ome milk, and the be&s;t bread he had, which though cour&s;e, was good. They all &s;at down upon the gra&s;s, and made a comfortable repa&s;t.&mdash; However, Charlotte began to be afraid her parents might come home, and be unea&s;y at her ab&s;ence; and the little boy was &s;orry to go, but was fadly afraid, &s;hould he &s;tay, of being &s;colded by his mother.</P>
<P>"This mother of your's, (&s;aid the old man) mu&s;t be very cro&s;s to &s;cold you."&mdash; "She is not always &s;o, (replied the boy) but though &s;he loves me, &s;he makes me fear her."&mdash;"And your father?" "Oh, I &s;carcely knew him, he having been dead the&s;e four years."&mdash;"Dead the&s;e four years! (interrupted the old man, and fix|ing his eyes attentively on the boy). Is it po&s;&s;ible that I have &s;ome recollection of your features? Can it be little Francis!" &mdash;"Yes, yes, Francis is my name."</P>
<P>For a few moments the old man &s;tood motionle&s;s, and with an altered voice, his
<PB N="258" REF="047362_0263_1022CF92AE525A48">
eyes &s;wimming with tears, cryed out, "My dear Francis, you do not recollect your grandfather! Embrace me! You have got the very features of my &s;on! My deare&s;t child, you was not thinking of me! My &s;on affectionately loved me, and his &s;on will love me al&s;o. My old age will not be &s;o mi&s;erable as I expected, and the evening of my life will not pa&s;s without &s;ome joy. I &s;hall depart in peace!&mdash;But I forget, that by detaining you, I may expo&s;e you to your mother's anger. Go, my dear child, for I do not wi&s;h that my joy &s;hould co&s;t you tears. Go, love your mother, and obey her commands, even though you &s;hould not come and &s;ee me. Come and &s;ee me if you can; but do not di&s;obey or tell a &s;tory on any account."</P>
<P>He then turned to Charlotte, and &s;aid, though he then did not wi&s;h her to &s;tay, for fear of offending her parents, yet he hoped &s;he would come again, He then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, giving them a hearty ble&s;&s;ing, and the two children walked away hand in hand.</P>
<P>Charlotte got home &s;afe before her pa|rents, who were not long after her, when &s;he told them every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed, which furni&s;hed an agreeable conver&s;ation for the evening.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="047362_0264_1022CF943205F820">The next day, they all went to &s;ee the good old man, and afterwards frequently repeated their vi&s;its. Francis al&s;o came to &s;ee his grandfather, who was rejoiced to hear him &s;peak, and to receive his affection|ate care&s;&s;es. Francis, on his &s;ide, was e|qually rejoiced, excepting when he did not meet with Charlotte; for then he went home &s;orrowful and &s;ad.</P>
<P>The nearer Francis arrived at manhood, the more his affections for Charlotte en|crea&s;ed; and accordingly, when he was old enough to marry, he would think of no other woman, though &s;he was not rich. The old man lived to &s;ee them married and hap|py, and then finally clo&s;ed his eyes in peace.</P>
