<P>THE Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>He|brews</HI> informs us, <HI>That it is appointed for all Men once to die; after that,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>comes Judgment.</HI>&mdash; And I think if any Con&s;ideration be &s;ufficient to a|waken a &s;leeping drow&s;y World, it mu&s;t be this&mdash; That there will be a Day wherein the&s;e Heavens &s;hall be wrapt up like a &s;crowl, this Element melt with fervent Heat, the Earth and all the Things therein be burnt up, and every Soul and every Nation and Language &s;ummoned to appear before the dreadful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of the righteous Judge of Quick and Dead, to receive Rewards and Puni&s;hments according to the Deeds done in their Bodies.&mdash;The great Apo&s;tle ju&s;t mentioned, when brought before <HI>Felix,</HI> could think of no better means to convert that &s;inful Man than to rea&s;on of Temperance, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and more e&s;pecially of a Judgment to come.&mdash;The fir&s;t might in &s;ome Mea&s;ure affect, but I am per&s;waded it was the la&s;t Con&s;ideration, I mean of a Judgment to come, that made him tremble; and &s;o bad as the World is grown yet there are few have their Con&s;ciences &s;o far &s;cared, as with a red hot Iron, as to deny that there will be a Reckoning hereafter. The promi&s;cuous Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence in this

Life, wherein we &s;ee good Men afflicted, de&s;titute, tormented, and the Wicked permitted Triumphantly to ride over their Heads, has been always looked up|on as an indi&s;putable Argument, by the generality of Men, that there will be a day in which God will Judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Admini&s;ter true Equity unto his People.&mdash;Some indeed are &s;o bold as to deny it, while they are engaged in the pur&s;uit of the Lu&s;t of the Eye, and the Pride of Life.&mdash;But follow them to their Death-Beds, ask them, when their Souls are ready to launch into Eternity, what they then think of a Judgment to come? and they will tell you they dare not give their Con&s;ciencies the Lye any longer.&mdash;They feel a fear|ful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation in their Hearts.&mdash;Since then the&s;e Things are &s;o, does it not highly concern each of us, my Brethren, before we come on a bed of Sickne&s;s, &s;eriou&s;ly to exa|mine how the Account &s;tands between God and our Souls, and how it will fare with us in that Day? As for the openly Prophane, the Drunkard, the Whore-monger, the Adulterer, and &s;uch like, there's no doubt of what will become of them&mdash;without Re|pentance they &s;hall never enter into the Kingdom of God and his Chri&s;t, No, their Damnation &s;lumbereth not, A burning fiery Tophet kindled by the Fury of God's eternal Wrath is prepared for their Reception, wherein they mu&s;t Suffer the Vengeance of an eter|nal Fire.&mdash;Nor is there the lea&s;t doubt of the State of true Believers&mdash;For tho' they be de&s;pi&s;ed and re|jected of natural Men, yet being born again of God, they are Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Chri&s;t&mdash; They have the earne&s;t of the promi&s;ed Inheritance in their Hearts, and are a&s;&s;ured that a new and living way is made open for them, into the Holy of Holies,

Day of Judgment, when he &s;hall come to take them home to him&s;elf, and pre&s;ent them, before Men and Angels, as his purcha&s;e to his Father, without Spot or Wrinkle or any &s;uch Thing.&mdash;By the Ten Vir|gins we are to under&s;tand the Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tia|nity in General&mdash;All are called Virgins, becau&s;e all are called to be Saints.&mdash;Who&s;oever Names the Name of Chri&s;t is obliged by that very Profe&s;&s;ion to depart from all Iniquity.&mdash;The pure and cha&s;te in Heart are the only Per&s;ons that will be &s;o ble&s;&s;ed as to &s;ee God.&mdash;As Chri&s;t was born of a Virgin's Womb, &s;o he can dwell in none but Virgins Souls, made Pure and Holy by the Cohabitation of his Holy Spirit.&mdash;But what &s;ays the Apo&s;tle? <HI>All are not</HI> I&s;ralites <HI>that are of</HI> I&s;rael&mdash;<HI>All are not true Chri&s;tians that are called after the Name of Chri&s;t</HI>&mdash; No, &s;ays our Lord, in the 2d. v. <HI>Five of the&s;e Vir|gins were Wi&s;e,</HI> i. e.

Biggots as to the Form; but all the while they were Strangers to and in effect denyed the Power of God|line&s;s in their Hearts. They would go to Church, but at the &s;ame Time, think it no harm to go to a Ball or an A&s;&s;embly, notwith&s;tanding they promi&s;ed at their Bapti&s;m, <HI>to renounce the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World.</HI>&mdash;They were &s;o exceeding fearful of being Righteous overmuch, that they would even per&s;ecute tho&s;e that were truly Devout, if they attempted to go a &s;tep farther than them&s;elves. In one Word, they never effectually felt the Powers of the World to come.&mdash;They thought they might be Chri&s;tians without &s;o much Inward feeling, and therefore, notwith&s;tanding their high Preten&s;ions, had only a Name to Live.</P>
<P>And now Sir, let me pau&s;e a while, and in the Name of God, whom I endeavour to &s;erve in the Go&s;pel of his dear Son, give me leave to ask one Que&s;tion. Whil&s;t I have been drawing, tho' in Minature, the Character of the&s;e fooli&s;h Virgins, have not many of your Con&s;ciences made the Appli|cation, and with a &s;mall &s;till, tho' articulate, Voice, &s;aid, thou Man, thou Woman art one of the&s;e fooli&s;h Virgins, for thy Practice and Sentiments agreeth thereto? Do not then &s;tifle but encourage the&s;e Con|victions, and who knows but that Lord, who is rich in mercy to all that call upon him faithfully, may &s;o work upon you even by this fooli&s;hne&s;s of Preach|ing as to make you wi&s;e Virgins before you return home?</P>
<P>What they were you &s;hall know immediately&mdash; <HI>But the Wi&s;e,</HI> &s;ays our Lord, ver. 4. <HI>took Oil in their Ve&s;&s;els with their Lamps.</HI>&mdash;Ob&s;erve, the Wi&s;e, that is, the true Believers, had their Lamps as well as the Fooli&s;h Virgins, for Chri&s;tianity does not require us

to ca&s;t off all outward Forms.&mdash;We may u&s;e Forms and yet not be formal: For In&s;tance, it is po&s;&s;ible to wor&s;hip God in a &s;et Form of Prayer, and yet wor|&s;hip him in Spirit and in Truth. And therefore Brethren let us not judge one another. The wi&s;e Virgins had their Lamps, herein did not ly the differ|ence between them and the Fooli&s;h, that one wor&s;hip|ed God with a Form and the other did not.&mdash;No, as the <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> and <HI>Publican</HI> went up to the Temple to pray, &s;o the&s;e Wi&s;e and fooli&s;h Virgins might go to the &s;ame Place of Wor&s;hip and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir under the &s;ame Mini&s;try&mdash;But then the Wi&s;e took Oil in their Ve&s;|&s;els with their Lamps, they kept up the Form, but did not re&s;t in it, their Words in prayer were the Language of their Hearts, and they were no Stran|gers to inward Feelings, they were not afraid of &s;earching Doctrine, nor affronted when Mini&s;ters told them they de&s;erve to be damned&mdash;They were not &s;elf Righteous, but were willing that Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould have all the Glory of their Salvation, they were convinced that the Merrits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t were to be apprehended only by Faith; but yet were they as careful to maintain good Works as tho' they were to be ju&s;tified by them&mdash;in &s;hort their Obedience flowed from Love and Gratitude, and was cheerful, con&s;tant, uniform, univer&s;al like that Obedience which the Holy Angels pay our Father in Hea|ven.</P>
<P>Here then let me exhort you to pau&s;e again; and if any of you can faithfully apply the&s;e Characters to your Hearts, give God the Glory and take the Comfort to your own Souls, you are not Fal&s;e but true Believers.&mdash;Je&s;us Chri&s;t has been made of God to you Wi&s;dom, even that Wi&s;dom, whereby you &s;hall be made Wi&s;e unto Salvation&mdash;God &s;ees a dif|ference

Death is only terrible to tho&s;e that have no Hope, becau&s;e they live with|out Faith in the World. Who&s;oever there are a|mong&s;t you, that have received the fir&s;t Fruits of the Spirit, I am per&s;uaded you are ready to cry out with Holy <HI>Job</HI> we would not live here always, we long to be di&s;&s;olved that me may be with Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And tho' Worms mu&s;t de&s;troy our Bodies as well as others, yet we are content, being a&s;&s;ured that our Redeemer liveth, that he will &s;tand at the latter Days upon the Earth, and that in our Fle&s;h we &s;hall &s;ee God.</P>
<P>But it is not &s;o with Hypocrites and Unbelievers beyond the Grave, for what &s;ays our Lord? And at Midnight, ob&s;erve at Midnight, when all was hu&s;h'd and quiet, and no one dreaming of any &s;uch Thing.

but wi&s;e Virgins, notwith&s;tanding, I be&s;eech you al&s;o &s;uffer the Word of Exhortation: For wi&s;e Virgins are too apt, Whil&s;t the Bridegroom tarries, to &s;lum|ber and &s;leep. Watch therefore, my dear Brethren, watch and pray at this Time e&s;pecially, for perhaps a Time of &s;uffering is at hand.&mdash;The Ark of the Lord begins already to be driven into the Wilderne&s;s.&mdash;Be ye therefore upon your Watch, and &s;till per&s;evere in following your Lord even without the Camp bearing his Reproach: The Cry that has been lately made has awakened the Devil and his Servants, they begin to rage horribly and well they may: For I hope their Kingdom is in danger, watch therefore, my dear Bre|thren for if we are not always upon our Guard, a Time of Tryal may overtake us unawares, and in|&s;tead of owning like <HI>Peter,</HI> we may be tempted to de|ny our Ma&s;ter. Set Death and Eternity often before you, look unto Je&s;us the Author and Fini&s;her of your Faith, and con&s;ider how little a while it will be ere he comes to Judgment, and then our Reproach &s;hall be wiped away: The Accu&s;ers of us and our Brethren &s;hall be ca&s;t down, and we all &s;hall be &s;hut in Hea|ven for ever with our dear Lord Je&s;us.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, what I &s;ay unto you I &s;ay unto all, <HI>WATCH,</HI> High and Low, Rich and Poor, Young and Old one with another, I be&s;eech you by the Mercies of Je&s;us whom I am now preaching, be upon your Guard, fly, fly, to Je&s;us Chri&s;t that Heavenly Bridegroom; behold he de&s;ires to take you to him&s;elf, mi&s;erable, poor, blind and naked as you are, yet he is willing to cloath you with his everla&s;ting Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and make you partakers of that Glory which he enjoyed with the Father before the World began. Oh! do not turn a deaf Ear to me, do not reject the Me&s;&s;age on ac|count of the meane&s;s of the Me&s;&s;enger: I am a Child,

a Youth of uncircumci&s;ed Lips; but the Lord has cho&s;en me that the Glory might be all his own: Had he &s;ent to invite you by a learned <HI>Rabbi,</HI> you might have been tempted to think the Man had done &s;omething; but now God has &s;ent a Child that cannot &s;peak, that the Excellency of the Power may be &s;een not to be of Man but of God.

I cou'd &s;ay more, but the other Bu&s;ine&s;s and Duties of the Day oblige me to &s;top. May the Lord give you all an hearing Ear and Obedient Heart, and &s;o clo&s;ely unite you to him&s;elf by one Spirit, that when he &s;hall come in a terrible Maje&s;ty to judge Mankind, you may be found having on a Wedding Garment, and ready to go in with him to the Marriage.</P>
