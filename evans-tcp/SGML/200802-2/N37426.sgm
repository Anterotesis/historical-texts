<HEAD>LIFE OF Poll Flanders.</HEAD>
<P>AT the reque&s;t of &s;everal friends, and finding my&s;elf draw near the clo&s;e of life, I &s;hall, in this edition, give a more full account of my birth and parentage than any yet publi&s;hed; as al&s;o of my real name, and the rea|&s;ons I had for taking the name of <HI>Poll Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>My grandfather was born at <HI>Carrickfergus</HI> in the north part of the kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> of good and hone&s;t par|entage, who joining with O'<HI>Neale</HI> in the troubles of that Kingdom, forfeited his e&s;tate, and a little after died for grief, leaving my father <HI>James Fitzpatrick,</HI> to the care of his brother, who brought him up a gentleman; but at his death did not leave him above fifty pounds to &s;eek his fortune, with which he equipped him&s;elf like a gentle|man, as he really was one, and came over to <HI>England;</HI> but that &s;mall &s;um being &s;oon expended, he was driven very much to his &s;hifts, and liv'd upon dice and Mi&s;&s;es as is u&s;ual with too many of that country, and at that time got acquainted with my mother, who&s;e name was <HI>Mary Flanders,</HI> and the top of all the mi&s;tre&s;&s;es about <HI>Whets|ton's-park,</HI> then the rendezvous of all the Mi&s;&s;es about town. But her beauty fading, and &s;he becomine an old face, they found that way of living would not maintain them in their extravagancies, and my father was obliged now and then to <HI>turn out,</HI> and go upon the highway, wherein he always behaved like a gentleman, and never killed any one in his life, as he declared the very la&s;t moment of his breath; but a&s;&s;ociating with &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">og<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es wor&s;e than him&s;elf, he was in a years time betray'd by his companions, taken, committed to Newgate, and exe|cuted,

at Tyburn, where he died truly penitent, and like a good chri&s;tian, made a decent Exit.</P>
<P>My mother was young with child, at the death of my father, and his untimely end had like to have co&s;t her her life; but it was not &s;o decreed, for in a little time &s;he recovered, and found her&s;elf in a more mi&s;era|ble condition than &s;he expected, being much in debt with the charges &s;he was at, in hopes of getting a reprieve for my father; and the world frowned very hardly upon her, every one was for getting his own, tho they knew &s;he had not a farthing to pay them; &s;o mi&s;erable is the ca&s;e of per&s;ons in di&s;tre&s;s, that in&s;tead of affording pity, they add one affliction to another; and nothing would &s;erve the hard hearted creditors, but that they would have my mother rot in a goal, and make dice of her bones, which made her begin to look about her, and con&s;ider what way &s;he had be&s;t to take: if &s;he could not get money, &s;he knew &s;he mu&s;t &s;oon peri&s;h in goal; how to get it &s;he had no way, her beauty being, as I &s;aid before decayed, and &s;he having been an old batter|ed wretch about town, had but little to expect from that cour&s;e of life; be&s;ide, the very name of having her hu&s;|band hanged, added very much to her misfortunes. al|though her creditors were mo&s;t of them of that frater|nity them&s;elves; yet the&s;e hard-hearted creatures, never dreaming how &s;oon it might be their own turns to fol|low him, arre&s;ted her, and threw her into the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ea,</HI> where &s;he lay in a very deplorable condition for above a month, and was then di&s;charged upon paying her &s;ees, when they found they could make nothing of her.</P>
<P>When &s;he came out, &s;he found her&s;elf in a wor&s;e con|dition than before, and did not know what to do to &s;upport nature; to work &s;he was unable, and to beg a|&s;hamed: and in this deplorable &s;tate &s;trolling about the &s;treets one evening, &s;he met a woman that had been a pri&s;oner with her in the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ea,</HI> with whom going to drink a pint of beer, comparing notes, they found their conditions to be much alike, and the other being an old practitioner, advi&s;ed my mother to go along with her a &s;hoplifting, who not having a farthing in the world, and being afraid to go home for want of money

to pay her lodging, they at length agreed, when going along <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ap&s;ide,</HI> they went into a linen draper's &s;hop, and cheapened &s;everal pieces of linen, in which time the other woman concealed three pieces of holland, which &s;he gave to my mother to hide under her petticoats, and &s;he went away, leaving my mother to &s;hift for her&s;elf, who being but a young practitioner at the bu&s;ine&s;s, was ea&s;ily di&s;covered, &s;ecured, and carried before a ju&s;tice of the peace, who committed her to Newgate, from whence &s;he was carried to the Old Bailey, and there condemn|ed; but pleading pregnancy, was respited for about four months, when being called down to her former judgment, was ordered for tran&s;portation till which &s;he lay in Newgate above five months, and then left me in the hands of the pri&s;oners, who &s;old me to the Gyp&s;ies, with whom I continued till I was about three years old, when they left me at Colche&s;ter in Essex, where I was taken up by the pari&s;h, but could give no account how I came there only that I belonged to the Gyp&s;ies, and that they had left me, but why or where they were gone, I did not know, neither could they find them, al|though they &s;ent every way to look for them.</P>
<P>I was now too young to take care of my&s;elf, not be|ing above three years old, and was ordered by the church warden, to the pari&s;h nur&s;e, who proved a very good &s;ort of a woman, and took a great deal of care of the children under her, teaching them to read and work till they were fit to go to bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Under this good woman I continued till I was eight years old, and then the officers were for putting me to &s;ervice, which I had a &s;trong aver&s;ion to, and told my nur&s;e, if &s;he would keep me, I was &s;ure I could get my own living by &s;pinning and working with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and that I would work night and day rather than leave her. Fooli&s;h child, &s;aid &s;he, thou wilt learn to do hou&s;e-work as thou ha&s;t learnt thy needle, and they won't put thee to hard work at fir&s;t: Yes they will, &s;aid I, and if I don't do it they will beat me: and then I could not forbear crying for a quarter of an hour, which &s;o moved the good woman, that &s;he took me in her arms and

&s;aid I &s;hould not go to &s;ervice, &s;he would &s;peak to the Mayor to let me continue at my needle a little longer.</P>
<P>The next day, &s;he going to wait on the Mayor, who would often &s;end for her to know how the children did, &s;he told him they were all well, but that &s;he had one that would be nothing but a gentlewoman; which &s;tory &s;o plea&s;ed the Mayor's lady and her daughters, that in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> week's time they came to the &s;chool, and being plea&s;|ed with the order and management of the children, one of the daughters enquired which was &s;he that was a gentlewoman? which terribly frighted me; but &s;he taking me by the hand, and &s;aying <HI>Mi&s;s has a lady's hand, and for ought I know may be one before &s;he dies.</HI> This gave me courage to pre&s;ent my work to Mrs. Mayore&s;s who, being mightily plea&s;ed with it, gave me a &s;hilling, and bade me mind my work, and I would be a gentle|woman the &s;ooner.</P>
<P>But alas! they did not know what I meant by a gen|tlewoman; for the young ladies a&s;king me, What a gentlewoman was, I told them, to get my own living by my needle, and not go to &s;ervice: This prattle &s;o plea&s;ed the daughters, that they gave me money too.</P>
<P>I gave my money to my nur&s;e, and told her &s;he &s;hould have all I got when I was a gentlewoman, which &s;o diverted the good old woman, that &s;he would be often talking with me, all which &s;he related to the Mayor's daughters, who told other young ladies of the town, with whom they were u&s;ed to come every week to &s;ee me, and they were often u&s;ed to &s;ay I was a very pretty girl, which made me not a little proud, and I began to &s;pruce my&s;elf up a little finer than the re&s;t of the chil|dren, with linen and laced head-dre&s;&s;es, and gloves, which my nur&s;e bought me with the money that was given me, which &s;he always faithfully gave an account of to tho&s;e who gave it me; which &s;o plea&s;ed many of them, that they &s;trove who &s;hould give me mo&s;t money; &s;o that by the time I was ten years old. I was as fine as a gentlewoman indeed. And now I was again call|ed upon to go to &s;ervice, but by this time my nur&s;e did not care to part with me, for I was now become u&s;eful to her &s;chool, and could teach the children in her ab|&s;ence,
<PB N="7" REF="049057_0006_10264D03A5CBA4D8">
&s;o that &s;he told them, if they plea&s;ed &s;he would keep the gentlewoman her&s;elf, which &s;o plea&s;ed the la|dies, that they were kinder to me than before, and bro't me fine works to do, which they not only paid me for, but taught me how to do it them&s;elves, &s;o that by twelve years old, I not only helped my nur&s;e in her &s;chool, but paid her for my keeping, and went very genteelly be|&s;ides, and had money in my pocket.</P>
<P>At la&s;t one of the ladies de&s;ired my nur&s;e in the Chri&s;tmas to let me go home with her to keep her daugh|ters company, which the old woman could &s;carcely be per&s;uaded to do, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, the lady would keep me for good and all, which &s;he told her &s;he did not know but &s;he might do in a little time, but at pre&s;ent I &s;hould only &s;tay a week, to &s;ee how I could agree with her daughters, where I had not been a day or two, but I be|came the delight of the whole family.</P>
<P>However, according to promi&s;e, I went home to my nur&s;e again, much, you may be &s;ure, again&s;t my incli|nation; for I had gotten &s;uch a ta&s;te of genteel living at my lady's, that every thing was out of order at my nur&s;e's, and nothing could plea&s;e me, having quite other notions of being a gentlewoman than I had formerly and believed it to be a fine thing even to be among la|dies; However, the many obligations I had to my nur&s;e would not let me think of leaving her, and, indeed if I had I did not know where to go, &s;o that I judged it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> continue longer with her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome kind opportunity &s;hould offer; which I did till I was pa&s;t fourteen years of age, when my good old woman &s;ickened and died, which indeed was a &s;ad grief to me, I not knowing what to do, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> where to go, the pari&s;h children being remov|ed, and the &s;chool broken up; and what was &s;till wor&s;e, my nur&s;e had two and twenty &s;hillings &s;terling of mine, which was my all, in her hands when &s;he died, which her daughter at fir&s;t denied to give me, altho her mother had told her of it before &s;he died.</P>
<P>I was now a poor gentlewoman indeed, for the goods being removed, I did not know where to go, till &s;ome of the neighbours informed the lady, in who&s;e family I had been how I was left, who &s;ent a maid for me, and I
<PB N="8" REF="049057_0007_10264D06662F4C90">
went with a glad heart, you may be &s;ure; however the fright had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon me, that I was willing to do any thing they &s;hould put me to; but my good lady de&s;igned no hard work for me, but received me very generou&s;ly, and if po&s;&s;ible, exceeded the old wo|man in kindne&s;s; and the Mayore&s;s &s;oon after &s;ent for me, and then others, &s;o that I was very much made of wherever I went; but the lady would not part with me, altho the Mayore&s;s claimed me as her right, &s;he being the fir&s;t that had taken notice of me.</P>
<P>By this time I was between &s;eventeen and eighteen years of age, and had all the advantages of improve|ment imaginable; and the young ladies having ma&s;ters at home, teaching them French, dancing, and mu&s;ic, I learnt fa&s;ter than any of them, and could &s;ing much better, which made me not a little proud of my&s;elf; and I al&s;o heard the young gentlemen &s;ay, I was the pretti|e&s;t girl they ever &s;aw in their lives, which was no &s;mall addition to the good opinion. I had of my&s;elf. Not|with&s;tanding this, I carried my&s;elf very mode&s;tly, which gained me the e&s;teem of all that knew me, more e&s;pe|cially the lady's two &s;ons who both fell in love with me, and which proved my ruin, as you &s;hall hear hereafter.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t was a gentleman of plea&s;ure, and knew the gaiety of the town as well as the &s;olidity of the coun|try; he was always prai&s;ing my beauty, and endeavor|ing to entrap me, which he knew as well how to do as to catch a patridge; always commending me to his &s;i&s;ters, but to be &s;ure it was in my hearing, which would make them often rebuke him, &s;aying, I heard what he &s;aid, which he would put off with a joke, and then pre&s;|ently begin to talk of me again, this plea&s;ed me &s;o much that I was always as willing to hear as he was to com|mend.</P>
<P>After this fly way of laying his bait, he endeavored to catch me more openly: and coming one day into his &s;i&s;ter's chamber when I was with them, he a&s;ked me if my cheeks did not burn? to which I an&s;wered not a word, but blu&s;hed and made a courte&s;y: why? &s;aid the lady becau&s;e we have been talking of her &s;aid he, above half an hour below &s;tairs: and what then? &s;aid his &s;i&s;|ter,
<PB N="9" REF="049057_0008_10264D080C8E6AA0">
I am &s;ure you can &s;ay no harm of her: no faith, &s;ays he, far from it, we all agree &s;he is the hand&s;ome&s;t young woman in Colche&s;ter, and in &s;hort &s;he is become the toa&s;t of the town.</P>
<P>One of the young ladies checked her brother for talk|ing so before me, and &s;aid, that Betty wants but one thing, and &s;he had as good want all the graces, and that's money, which is all that men want now-a-days; for tho a woman were as beautiful as Venus, cha&s;te as Dia|na, and wi&s;e as Minerva&mdash;hold, &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid the younger, who was &s;tanding by, if I could find a wom|an &s;o accompli&s;hed as you talk of, I would not matter the money; but you will ever be unea&s;y about that, &s;aid the &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>How do you know, &s;aid the elder brother, you have more fortune than beauty: you need not exclaim again&s;t it, then &s;aid the &s;i&s;ter, I have the better of my neigh|bors: You don't know that, &s;aid the younger brother; beauty will often &s;teal a hu&s;band in &s;pite of money, and the maid often makes a better bargain than her mi&s;tre&s;s that rides in her coach before her.</P>
<P>I thought it was high time for me to withdraw, which I did, but not &s;o far, but I heard all their di&s;cour&s;e, which proved not much to my advantage; for the younger brother fell out with his &s;i&s;ter about me, which &s;he &s;o re&s;ented, that her future conduct was very di&s;a|greeable, tho indeed at that time &s;he had no occa&s;ion, for I had no thoughts of her younger brother, and the elde&s;t &s;aid &s;o many things in je&s;t, that I gave credit to nothing he &s;aid.</P>
<P>Knowing they were out, he came one day to the door, and knocking as he u&s;ed to do, I told him the la|dies were gone out; I know that &s;aid he, my dear, but you are here, and that's better; and upon that he cla&s;p|ed me in his arms, and gave me repeated ki&s;&s;ed, at which I &s;trugged, I can&punc;t &s;ay but it was faintly, and &s;o he held me and ki&s;&s;ed me till he was out of breath, &s;wearing he was in love with me, which put me into &s;ome di&s;order, he &s;till continuing to repeat it, and I cannot &s;ay but I in my heart wi&s;hed it, were &s;o; however I &s;oon recov|ered my&s;elf, and he &s;eeing his sisters coming up the gar|den,

&s;wore he was in earne&s;t, ki&s;&s;ed me and took his leave.</P>
<P>My head now ran upon nothing but love; and I can|not &s;ay, but the pride of having &s;uch a fine gentleman in love with me, would have made me yield to any thing he could have de&s;ired, had he at that time thought fit to have a&s;ked it, but he was more mode&s;t then, than he proved afterwards: for in a few days, the family being all abroad, and I not dreaming he was at home, he &s;urprized me in his younger &s;i&s;ter's chamber, and fell a ki&s;&s;ing me as before, and when he had done, he &s;at down, and &s;wore he was charmed with my beauty, and abundance of fine things, and that if I would but return his love, I &s;hould &s;ave his life; and then taking me in his arms, he threw me upon the bed, and ki&s;&s;ed me vio|lently, but offered then no rudene&s;s to me, lifting me up again, and put five guineas into my hand, &s;wearing it was in hone&s;t affection; and then going down &s;tairs, and finding the hou&s;e clear, he returned and fel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to work with me, as he did before, but with le&s;s ceremony, for &s;hutting the door, he &s;aid he fancied there was &s;ome|body coming up &s;tairs, Mi&s;s Betty; but I &s;aid I believ|ed not, for there was no body in the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e but he and I; well, my dear, &s;aid he, it is good to be &s;ure, however, and &s;itting down he began to tell me how he loved me, and that as &s;oon as he came to his e&s;tate he would mar|ry me, which I had no more wit than to believe; and then he threw me upon the bed again, and &s;topt my mouth with ki&s;&s;es, and offered &s;ome things which de|cency will not permit me to mention; however he did not attempt the la&s;t favor, on which he made a plea for his other freedoms, which done, he put a handful of gold in my hands, and renewed his former prote&s;tations of love. Vanity had now gotten the ma&s;ter of my virtue, &amp; I was re&s;olved not to deny him any favour he &s;hould a&s;k &amp; in|deed I wondered that he had not done it before: How|ever, I was cunning enough not to give the lea&s;t &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;picion in the family, and for that rea&s;on I avoided &s;eeing him as much as po&s;&s;ibly, but &s;ometimes we had a meeting or &s;o, when be might have had any favour had not he

<P>The Devil, who never wants means as well as agents, to do his work, &s;oon found out a way to enjoy that, which I cannot but &s;ay we had both &s;o long wi&s;hed for. Com|ing one day into his &s;i&s;ter's chamber, he de&s;ired them to let me go to a milliner's for two neck cloths he had bought, of the &s;ame mu&s;lin with a turnover he had in his hand, in which he gave me a note which was my direc|tion; and then he began to tell them a long &s;tory of a vi&s;it he was going to make, and that he &s;hould be very glad of their company, which they de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed of, becau&s;e they had company to vi&s;it them that after|noon, as he knew very well.</P>
<P>In the mean time a gentleman's chariot came to the door, under pretence of fetching him, but he had bor|rowed it on purpo&s;e, which he had no &s;ooner notice of, than be took his leave of his &s;i&s;ters, in a very formal man|ner, and came to meet me at <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">le-end,</HI> where he had ap|pointed in the note at a confidents of his, in who&s;e hou&s;e we had all the conveniency we de&s;ired to be as wicked as we would.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t he began to tell me, that his love would not let him betray me, and that he would marry me as &s;oon as he came to his e&s;tate, and many &s;uch prote&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ions that he needed not to have done; and &s;aid he, my dear, if you prove with child.

<P>This did not at all trouble me, knowing that I &s;hould be provided for, and that if I &s;hould prove with child I mu&s;t then go away with di&s;grace: but the young gentle|man coming to me, &s;aid, Since it was known, he was not a&s;ham'd to own it, and that if I would have him, he was bred up to the law, and could maintain me, let his father and mother be pleas'd or not, he was not afraid to make me his wife, which words he &s;poke &s;o cordially, that I began to repent of my conver&s;ation with his elder brother, but I could not bear to think of being a Mi&s;s to one brother and a wife to the other, be&s;ide, I &s;till imag|ined the elder would marry me; but then I remembered he had not &s;aid one word of that &s;ince I was his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I was now, to be &s;ure, in a great &s;trait, the one laid clo&s;e &s;iege to me, and declar'd it publickly, which the other could not be ignorant of altho' he took no notice of it; upon which I began to think for the fir&s;t time, nev|er having done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> before, and re&s;olved to tell him of it, which I had an opportunity to do, very lucki|ly the next day,. (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he whole family being gone to <HI>Lon|don)</HI> he came as u&s;ual to &s;pend an hour or two with me; but he &s;oon perceiv'd an alteration in my countenance and that I had been crying and taking notice of it, en|quir'd very tenderly what was the matter, which I would now have concealed, but it was not to be done, he &s;till per&s;i&s;ting to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the cau&s;e of my grief and in reality I was willing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;hould, tho' I pretended otherwi&s;e, but

at la&s;t I told him, that indeed I was troubled, and I had great rea&s;on to be &s;o, for I knew not what cour&s;e to take unle&s;s he would direct me, upon which he bade me not to be troubled, for he would protect me, be it what it will.</P>
<P>I then began to &s;peak more freely, and told him I was afraid we were di&s;covered, for I was remov'd from his &s;i&s;ter's bed, to lie with one of the maids, who told me &s;he heard I was to be turned away, and that his mother &s;aid, it was not &s;afe to keep me in the hou&s;e; at which he &s;mil'd, and &s;aid No, my dear, we are not &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected, it is my brother Robin, who has been &s;o &s;illy to own his love to you, and is always vexing them, which makes them &s;o unkind to you.</P>
<P>I know that too, &s;aid I, but this is not all, your broth|er has not only the vanity to be confident of my being his wife, but has the folly to tell every body, notwith|&s;tanding I have &s;o often given him a flat denial which when they under&s;tand, they will pre&s;ently imagine there is &s;omething el&s;e in it, or I would never refu&s;e a match &s;o much above me; which &s;urpriz'd him &s;o that he own|ed, he did not well know what way he &s;hould take, but he would con&s;ider of it, and in the mean time advi&s;ed me not to con&s;ent, nor yet be rude to his brother, but keep him in &s;u&s;pen&s;e for a while; at which words I &s;eem'd to be very unea&s;y, &s;aying, He knew very well I had no con|&s;ent to give, that he had promis'd to marry me, and that he all along per&s;uaded me to call my&s;elf his wife.</P>
<P>He pacify'd me as well as he could, telling me if he were not my hu&s;band, he would be as good as a hu&s;band to me, &amp; then he gave me money; but he never offer'd to touch me, although we were two hours together, which I wondered at, con&s;idering how he u&s;ed to be, and what opportunity we had.</P>
<P>In about a week's time his brother came from Lon|don, when he took an opportunity to talk with him, tell|ing him, That he heard &s;trange news, that he made love to Mi&s;s Betty, which the younge&s;t frankly owned, but I find &s;ays he, &s;ome do concern them&s;elves about it, and u&s;e the poor girl ill, which I take as done to my&s;elf.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding all my reproaches, he replied again, my dear, I have not broken one promi&s;e with you yet; I did tell you I would marry you when I was come to my e&s;tate; but you &s;ee my father is a firm healthy man, and may live the&s;e thirty years &s;till, and not be older than &s;everal are round us in the town; and you never propo&s;ed my marrying you &s;ooner, becau&s;e you know it might be my ruin; and as to all the re&s;t, I have not failed you in any; you have wanted for nothing.</P>
<P>He told me he had but one que&s;tion then to a&s;k me that could lie in the way of it, and if that que&s;tion were an|&s;wered in the negative, he could not but think &s;till it was the only &s;tep I could take. I gue&s;&s;ed at the que&s;tion pre&s;ently, namely, whether I were &s;ure I was not with child? I told him he need not be concerned about that, for I was not; with this he took his leave, by rea&s;on of his mother and &s;i&s;ters ringing ju&s;t then at the gate. He left me in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion of thought from Tue&s;|day till Sunday, when all the family, but him&s;elf, went to church, and then he had me an hour and an half again by my&s;elf; and after falling into divers arguments, I a&s;ked him what opinion he could have of my mode&s;ty; that he could &s;uppo&s;e I could entertain a thought of ly|ing with two brothers? and a&s;&s;ured him it could never be.</P>
<P>Being &s;urprized at my ob&s;tinacy, as he called it, he told me it was &s;uch an unlooked for cri&s;is, that he did not &s;ee any other way to &s;ave us both from ruin; and that if he mu&s;t &s;ay no more of it, he knew of nothing el&s;e we had to talk of, and &s;o he ro&s;e up to take his leave; I ro&s;e up too, as if with the &s;ame indifference, but when

he came to give me, as it were, the parting ki&s;s, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> vehemently, and, tho I would have &s;poken, could not, and only pre&s;&s;ing his hand, &s;eemed to give him the adieu.</P>
<P>He was &s;en&s;ibly moved with this, &s;o he &s;at down again, and &s;aid a great many things to me, to abate the exce&s;s of my pa&s;&s;ion; but letting me plainly &s;ee that he would decline me in the main point, nay, even as mi&s;|tre&s;s, making it a point of honor not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with the wo|man, that for ought he knew might come to be his bro|ther's wife.</P>
<P>The bare lo&s;s of him as a gallant was not &s;o much my affliction, as the lo&s;s of his per&s;on, whom indeed I loved to di&s;traction, and the lo&s;s of all the expectations I had of having him one day for my hu&s;band; The&s;e things oppre&s;&s;ed my mind &s;o much, that I fell into a high fever, &s;o that none in the family expected my life. I was reduced very low, and was often delirious and light|headed, about the end of five weeks I grew better, but was &s;o weak, and recovered &s;o &s;lowly, that the phy&s;icians apprehended I &s;hould go into a con&s;umption; and which vexed me mo&s;t, they gave it as their opinion, that I was in love; upon this they were all &s;et on to examine me, and pre&s;s me to tell whether I were in love or not; but I denied my being in love at all.</P>
<P>They had, on this occa&s;ion, like to have put the whole family in an uproar; for happening to be all at table, but the father, when the maid told the old gentlewom|an that I could not eat what her lady&s;hip had &s;ent up: Alas! &s;ays &s;he, that poor girl I am afraid, will never be well; why, &s;ays the elder brother, how &s;hould &s;he be well? they &s;ay &s;he is in love.

Why, &s;ays Robin, do you think I'd let the girl die for love, and or one who is &s;o near at hand too: I find, &s;ays the elder &s;i&s;ter, if Betty be not in love, my brother is: I wonder he has not broken his mind to Betty, I warrant &s;he wont &s;ay No: They who yield when they are a&s;ked, &s;ays Robin, are one &s;tep before them who were never a&s;ked, and that's an an&s;wer to you.

<P>It run a great deal farther, and poor Betty lo&s;t ground by it extremely, I heard of it and cried heartily, and the old lady came up to me I complained to her, that it was very hard the doctors &s;hould pa&s;s &s;uch a cen&s;ure up|on me, for which they had no ground, and that I had more need to think of a coffin than of being in love. She de&s;ired I would an&s;wer her one que&s;tion: I told her I would which was, whether there were any thing between her &s;on Robert and me? I told her there was not, nor ever had been; adding that Mr. Robert had rattled, as &s;he knew it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> his way, and I took it to be a wild airy way of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">cour&s;e which had no &s;ignification in it. The old lady was fully &s;atisfied, and took her leave; but when &s;he came down &s;he found the brothers and &s;i&s;ters togeth|er by the ear; but her coming put a &s;top to it, telling them all the di&s;cour&s;e &s;he had with me, and that I &s;aid there was nothing between Mr. Robert and me, but Robert ramble, &s;o in his di&s;cour&s;e that no body know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> whether he be in earne&s;t or je&s;t.

&s;i&s;ter, we can &s;ay nothing to that; &s;he is never out doors; it mu&s;t be between you; I have been examined enough, &s;ays Robin, there is my brother, go to work with him.</P>
<P>This &s;tung the elder brother, who concluded that Ro|bin had di&s;covered &s;omething: P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ithee, &s;ays he, do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ories upon me, I deal in no &s;uch ware, and with that he went off.

<P>At la&s;t I was catched in the very &s;nare I laid for a|nother, by a draper, an acquaintance of my comrade's; for altho her brother had made &s;ome pretences, it was for a mi&s;tre&s;s, and that would not go down with one that had bitten of the bridle and had now money to make her&s;elf a wife, though I &s;oon found my mi&s;take, and had better been &s;old by my comrade to her brother, than have &s;old my&s;elf to a trade&s;man, who was a Rake, Gentleman, Shop-keeper, and Beggar all together.</P>
<P>I was hurried on to ruin, by my own fancy in the madde&s;t manner that ever woman was; for my hu&s;|band coming into a lump of money at once, thought it would never be day, and &s;pent &s;o extravagantly, that had I given him all I had at fir&s;t, it would have la&s;ted but a year.

<P>Nothing is more certain, than that women have the

<P>But to return to my own ca&s;e wherein there was at this time no little nicety: My pre&s;ent condition being not &s;o good as I de&s;ired, made the offer of a good hu&s;|band very acceptable, but I knew by experience, to be made cheap was not the way.

was with him, and he looked as if he were frightened, till one night I a&s;ked him, what if I &s;hould be with child! he bade me not be frightened at that, for he would take care of the child and me, which hardened us both &s;o much, that we repeated the crime every night, and in a little time it &s;o happened that I was with child, and when I was certain of it, I propo&s;ed tru&s;ting the &s;ecret to my landlady, who &s;aid &s;he knew it would come to that at la&s;t, and made us very merry about it that evening.</P>
<P>When I grew near my time, &s;he advi&s;ed him to go to London, and then acquainted the pari&s;h officers that there was a lady ready to lye in at her hou&s;e, but &s;he was a woman of fa&s;hion, and that &s;he knew her hu&s;band very well, which &s;atisfied them; and I lay in, in as much &s;tate as if I had really been a lady, having many of the be&s;t in the town at my labour.</P>
<P>My gentleman allowed me very hand&s;omely, and I was as &s;paring as po&s;&s;ible in my expences, &s;o that I &s;aved nearly one hundred pounds in my lying in. I had al&s;o a fine boy, which as &s;oon as he heard, he wrote a very obliging letter to me, and advi&s;ed me to come to London as &s;oon as I was able, and he would take a lodging for me at Hammer&s;mith, which I liked very well; and accordingly I took coach for my&s;elf, child, nur&s;e and maid&s;ervant, he meeting us at Rend|ing, where he took me in his own chariot, and conduct|ed us all to my new lodgings at Hammer&s;mith.</P>
<P>And now I wanted nothing to make me happy but to be a wife, which I knew could not be, for he had a wife already, but &s;he was mad, I therefore laid up a|gain&s;t a rainy day what I could, knowing very well that kept mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, like old cloths, are thrown away when they are done with: However, I lived &s;ix years with him, and in that time I had three fine children by him but only the fir&s;t lived. At length I was &s;urprized with a very melancholy letter from him, intimating, that he was very ill, and that he was afraid he &s;hould have another fit of &s;ickne&s;s but that he being in the hou&s;e with his wife's relations, it was not po&s;&s;ible for me to come to him, which he de&s;ired very much.</P>
<P>I was very much concerned at this account, you may

be &s;ure, and I was every day impatient to know how he did, hearing nothing further from him for about a month, I di&s;gui&s;ed my&s;elf like a &s;ervant maid in a round cap, and went to his hou&s;e, and &s;aid my ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ent to know how he did; where under|&s;tanding that the doctors &s;aid they had but little hopes of him, I began to con&s;ider that it was well that I had &s;aved &s;omething while he was alive to maintain me and my &s;on.</P>

<P>I was thunder&s;truck with this letter, as you may im|agine, but I never once reflected on my own conduct to|wards my hu&s;band, the linen-draper, or my brother whom I had married; but was only &s;orry for the lo&s;s of &s;o fine a gentleman, who had done &s;o many good-na|tured things for me; and being troubled about my little boy, not knowing what would become of him, I &s;ent him

<P>I was now free from all obligations: a wife or a mi&s;tre&s;s, except to the linen draper, whom I had never heard of nor my hu&s;band, or father brother at Virgin|ia, when I received, after a long expectation, a return of &s;ome goods from my brother, but upon condition of &s;igning a general relea&s;e, which I promi&s;ed to do, but having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he goods delivered fa&s;t, I would not do it; &s;o that by this means I found my little &s;tock amounted to about 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">0l. with which I had the world to begin again; but what was my greate&s;t misfortune, I was not the &s;ame woman as formerly, but now &s;omething old.</P>
<P>I thought upon &s;everal ways to &s;et me off, but noth|ing would offer, till at length a new &s;cene opened. There was in the hou&s;e where I lodged a North coun|try gentlewoman, who was talking to me of the cheap|ne&s;s of her country till at length &s;he tempted me to promi&s;e to go and live with her in the country, telling her, that altho' I had enough to live on, yet I found London was an extravagant place, and I did not much care for it.</P>
<P>Before I went, it came into my mind to go to the bank, where I had often been to receive the intere&s;t of &s;ome bill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and advi&s;e with one of the clerks, who always was very ready to &s;erve me; but when I told him what my bu&s;ine&s;s was, he a&s;&s;ured me, be could not do it with con|veniency to him&s;elf, but that he would recommend me to
<PB N="41" REF="049057_0040_10264D922BBC4230">
a gentleman whom he could be an&s;werable for and was always well plea&s;ed to do &s;uch acts of charity.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered I would rather have depended on him, be|cau&s;e I had found him hone&s;t, but if that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould not be, I would accept of his recommendation; he replied, you will be as well &s;atisfied with my friend as with me, and that he would give his word that he &s;hould a&s;k nothing for his pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ns, but that he him&s;elf was obliged, by virtue of that place, not to meddle with any bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I no &s;ooner &s;aw his friend, than I was &s;atisfied he was a very hone&s;t man by his looks, and to whom I told my circum&s;tances at large, how that I was a widow, newly came from America, and had a little money, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> little and was afraid to lo&s;e it having no friend to advi&s;e with, and that I was going to the North of England to live cheaply.</P>
<P>He told me, that I might lodge the money in the bank on account, which would entitle me to the money at any time, but then it would be e&s;teemed as running ca&s;h, or that I might buy &s;tock with it, but if I wanted to di&s;po&s;e of it at any time, I mu&s;t come to town to transfer it or el&s;e I might enter it in &s;ome friend's name, and he might receive it for me; and then &s;aid, &s;miling, madam, why don't you get an hone&s;t &s;teward that might take you and your money together! That, &s;aid I, is more difficult than the other, &s;aid he, he had a wife, or el&s;e he &s;hould have been very glad of the bar|gain; for, &s;aith he, I have a wife and no wife, and it would be no &s;in to hang her, for &s;he is a w&mdash;e.</P>
<P>That alters the ca&s;e indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;aid I, but a cuckold may be an hone&s;t man, and I don't que&s;tion but you will do my bu&s;ine&s;s hone&s;tly, and that you are very good to own &s;uch a woman for a wife. I do think, &s;aid he, to clear my hands of her; for to be plain I am no con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ented cuckold, though I cannot rid my hands of her as yet. I begun to wave the di&s;cour&s;e and talk of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, but I found he could not have done with it but went on, and told me, how that his bu&s;ine&s;s called him out of England, and that &s;he in the mean time had two children by an officer in the army, and that on her &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="42" REF="049057_0041_10264D94FA78EEE0">
he took her again and maintained her very well, till &s;he ran away with a linen draper, and robbed him of what &s;he could come at: and now madam, &s;aid he, &s;ince you come to a&s;k advice, let me a&s;k yours.</P>
<P>Alas &s;ir, &s;aid I, 'tis a nice ca&s;e that &s;ince &s;he is run away, you are well off I think: however you may get a divorce if you think fit, and then marry another. Will you take me, madam &s;aid he. I cannot tell, &s;aid I, your ca&s;e &s;eems wor&s;e than mine, although the que&s;tion plea&s;ed me better than any thing he had &s;aid before, however, I knew the way to &s;ecure him was to &s;tand off, and that it was time enough to accept it when he was able to perform it; upon which he broke off, and he made me promi&s;e to come the next day, which I did; and brought my maid with me, to let him &s;ee that I kept a maid, whom he de&s;ired me, to &s;end home, and he would wait on me in a coach by my&s;elf&mdash;which I did not much care for, for fear he &s;hould enquire into my character.</P>
<P>He provided a hand&s;ome &s;upper for me, and then began to talk of love and pre&s;&s;ed me to drink a gla&s;s or two of wine, and de&s;ired me to give him leave to make a propo&s;al; which I &s;aid I was willing to hear, provid|ed it were honorable. Why &s;aid he, it is to marry me, and to convince me that he meant honorably he would not live with me, or go to bed to me, till the divorce was obtained.</P>
<P>I declared the motion unfair, with &s;ome warmth, and told him there could be nothing in it, but to entangle us both in greater difficulties; but that if he did get a divorce, I did not know what I might &s;ay, or he could not expect that I &s;hould &s;ay yes, at fir&s;t a&s;king, be&s;ides I never did imagine that he had any &s;uch de&s;ign.</P>
<P>He pre&s;&s;ed me to give him a promi&s;e, which I would not before I had &s;een the i&s;&s;ue of my journey in the North, wherein my friend had promi&s;ed me great mat|ter, but I told him, as a pledge of my &s;incerity, I had entru&s;ted him with almo&s;t my all, and as &s;oon as he had &s;ued out the divorce, if he would &s;end me an account of it, I would come up to London, and&mdash;then we would talk more of the matter.</P>

It was a ba&s;e de&s;ign in me, I confe&s;s, and it proved ac|cordingly. I went with my friend (as I called her) in|to Lanca&s;hire, who all the way down treated me with a great deal of good manners, and her brother in a gen|tleman's coach met us at Warrington, and from thence carried us to Liverpool, where we were entertained at a merchant's hou&s;e three or four days, and then her un|cle, as &s;he called him, &s;ent a coach and four; which car|ried us to a gentleman's &s;eat forty miles further, where I was nobly entertained; but I di&s;covered they were all Roman Catholics, which did not in the lea&s;t alter their behaviour to me, altho the ladies &s;oon found I was not of their religion.</P>
<P>I &s;tayed here about &s;ix weeks and then we returned to a village near Liverpool, where her brother, as &s;he called him, met us in his own chariot with two footman, and carried us to his own hou&s;e, where I had not been long before he began to make love to me, his pretended &s;i&s;ter telling him I was a great fortune, and he pa&s;&s;ed for a gentleman of a thou&s;and pounds a year in Ireland. I cannot &s;ay but to outward appearance he was a fine gentleman, and talked as naturally of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> park, &s;tables, hor&s;es, game-keepers and tenants, as if he really had them all.</P>
<P>I own, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> never a&s;ked me about my fortune, for his &s;i&s;ter had already told him I had at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and pounds; but he often talked of &s;ettling a jointure on me of &s;ix hundred pounds a year, and that he would enter into covenants for performance: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> words &s;ounded &s;o plea&s;antly in my ears, that I soon con&s;ented to be married, never &s;o much as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> this while of my faithful citizen, with whom I had entru&s;ted my money.</P>
<P>After we had been married about a month, he began to talk of going to We&s;t-Che&s;ter, to embark for Ireland, where, when we came he a&s;ked me if I had no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;ettle at London before we went off; I &s;uppo&s;e, and he, the greate&s;t part of your e&s;tate, which my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tells me is in money, might want to be transferred, and therefore it will not be ami&s;s to go up to London before we go to Ireland.</P>

<P>I told him it was very unhappy, that &s;o much love and &s;o much good nature as I di&s;covered in him, &s;hould be thus precipitated into mi&s;ery, and that what little I had, was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to relieve us a week; and with that I pulled out a bankbill of twenty pounds, which with elev|en guineas I had in my pocket, I thought would have maintained me two or three years, which if it were ta|ken from me, I told him I was left de&s;titute; however, there it was at his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>He told me, that he &s;corned to make me miserable, and that he had fifty pounds left, and throwing it down on the table bade me take it, tho he &s;hould &s;tarve.

<P>Nothing ever made &s;o great an impre&s;&s;ion upon me as this letter, and more when I found in my pocket ten guineas, a gold watch, a diamond ring, and a plain one, upon which I could not forbear looking above two hours, till my maid came and told me dinner was ready, but I could not eat any thing you may be &s;ure: After it was over, I fell a crying. O Jemmy, come back, I'll beg, I'll &s;tarve with you, when to my &s;urprize, he comes

back in the evening, but without any &s;ervant, and I not knowing what could be the occa&s;ion of it, a&s;ked him how he could be &s;o unkind to leave me, and whether he did not hear me call him to come back again, which he &s;aid he did about ten miles off, upon Delamare fore&s;t, and that was the rea&s;on of his coming back, believing it would be very melancholy for me to travel to London alone, and that he might as well go that way as any other, &s;aying he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his &s;ervants, and that they were in a happier ca&s;e than him&s;elf, for they could get places when he might be in a goal.</P>
<P>Two days after this we quitted Che&s;ter, I in a &s;tage|coach, and he on hor&s;eback, leaving my maid behind me, and he came with me as far as Dun&s;table, within thirty miles of London, and there he told me he mu&s;t leave me, for he dur&s;t go no further; I told him if it were &s;o, I de&s;ired he would &s;tay a week or two in that town, which, he readily agreed to; then calling the landlady, he told her his wife was taken ill, and en|quired whether &s;he could not get us a lodging in the town for two or three nights, till I had recovered my|&s;elf; which &s;he willingly agreed to and indeed I liked the room very well, and the people of the inn as well, &s;o we paid the coach and took out our baggage, and then told him I would live with him there till I had &s;pent our money, which with a great deal of difficulty at length I brought him to agree to, and we &s;tayed here about a month, in which time he let me into part of his own life which was very &s;urprizing, and full of variety, and of which I &s;hall give a full account hereafter.</P>
<P>We parted at lad, with great reluctance on both &s;ides, for I found by what he &s;aid, that he dur&s;t not come to London, and the next day I came to St. Jones's in Cler|kon well, a private place where no body knew me; but being a &s;tranger, I did not know where to lye in, for I grew big, and people in the hou&s;e taking notice of it, intimated that I mu&s;t think of removing, which troub|led me &s;o much that I grew ill, and my melancholy in|crea&s;ed my di&s;temper, &s;o that the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e propo&s;ed to &s;end for a midwife, which &s;he did, who, told her, &s;he believed that my condition was pretty much in

her way; but I did not under&s;tand at fir&s;t, what &s;he meant: but the midwife &s;oon informed me, and &s;aid &s;he believed I was under &s;ome circum&s;tances that rendered my lying in difficult, and that if I plea&s;ed to communi|cate it to her, &s;he would &s;oon make all ea&s;y, which put new life into me, and I found my blood began to cir|culate immediately.</P>

<P>I looked upon the bills, and telling her I could not &s;ay but the bills were very rea&s;onable: but that I was &s;orry to tell her, I feared I mu&s;t be her lowe&s;t cu&s;tom|er. With all my heart, &s;aid &s;he, I have ten to one as many of them as the other; and then, &s;aid &s;he, if the child be dead born, or &s;hould not live, you &s;ave the

<P>I told her I would be her cu&s;tomer, but as I had two months to go, I might perhaps &s;tay with her longer than three months, and de&s;ired to know if &s;he would not be obliged to remove me before it was proper, which &s;he &s;aid &s;he never did upon any account whatever; and then looking about, &s;he began to find fault with my a|partment, and &s;aid I might remove as &s;oon as I plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>I quitted my lodgings at St. Jones's, and went to my new governe&s;s's where I was well looked after, and I under&s;tood that &s;he had about twelve ladies of plea&s;ure under her care at that time, and about thirty abroad. But before I was delivered, I received a letter from my tru&s;tee at the bank, full of obliging things, and pre&s;&s;ing me to come to London, which was &s;ent from Liverpool, as I had ordered; to which I returned an an&s;wer, and dated it at Liverpool, but &s;ent it by a me&s;&s;enger, as if it came by a friend to town, wherein I gave him to un|der&s;tand how glad I was, that he had obtained a divorce, but I que&s;tioned the lawfulne&s;s of his marrying again, notwith&s;tanding, I would be in London in three months at farthere&s;t.</P>
<P>I was brought to bed a little after receiving this letter, and then I received another from him, wherein he a&s;&s;ur|ed me, that his wife having a remor&s;e of con&s;cience af|ter the divorce was obtained, had de&s;troyed her&s;elf; and altho' he was concerned at her di&s;a&s;ter, yet he had no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and in it; for what he did was to do ju&s;tice, which ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eedingly &s;urprized me; and I began now to reflect on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> misfortunes of having a child, and &s;eeming more melancholy than ordinary, my governe&s;s daily pre&s;&s;ed me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> know the rea&s;on of it, which I did not know how to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her, becau&s;e I had formerly told her I had a hu&s;|band; but &s;he, daily importuning me, at la&s;t I related the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ole &s;tory of my Lanca&s;hire marriage, and then I &s;hew|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> her my friend's letter, wherein &s;he &s;aw how affection|ately he wrote to me, which as &s;oon as &s;he had read, &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a laughing, &s;aying, the other was no marriage, but

<P>But then there was this difficulty, which was the part|ing with thy child, which grieved me very much, but this was &s;oon removed, for it died within the month. Now I began to write to my friend in a more kind man|ner, and &s;ent him word, that I de&s;igned to be in town in a month, which he de&s;ired to be informed, becau&s;e he would come two days journey to meet me, which puz|zled me more than the other; till at la&s;t it came into my mind to go into the country, which would not only blind my old governe&s;s, but cover all my other affairs, for &s;he did not know, whether my lover lived in London or Lan|ca&s;hire; and &s;o taking a place in the &s;tage-coach to We&s;t Che&s;ter, where I had no manner of bu&s;ine&s;s but only to conceal my having been in London, I went down, and next week I took a place in another &s;tage-coach for Lon|don and &s;ent him word I &s;hould be up &s;uch a night, up|on the receipt of which, he met me according to prom|i&s;e at Brickhill.</P>
<P>He came in a very hand&s;ome coach with four hor&s;es and a &s;ervant to attend him, in which he took me, and ordering the coachman to drive into an inn, he be&s;poke a dinner, and afterwards we walked to &s;ee the town and church, and our landlord accompanied us when I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my gentleman enquired pretty much after the par&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my landlord, who told him he had a friend a little way off, who would &s;erve him and be as private as he plea&s;|ed; he an&s;wered it was very well, and &s;aid he believe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he &s;hould.</P>

<P>My landlord &s;ent away for the clergyman, and got him ready in the hou&s;e, and without any more words brought him up, who being a&s;ked if he were willing to marry a couple of &s;trangers replied with all his heart, but that he hoped it was not a clande&s;tine marriage, for he &s;aw madam was not a girl; but to put him out of all doubt, my gentleman gives him a licence, with which he was more &s;atisfied; but &s;o an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> not I, &s;aid I, 'tis time enough in the morning; be&s;ide &s;aid I, what do you mean &s;ir, to marry me in an inn?</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid the mini&s;ter, it is all one, I a&s;&s;ure you, your marriage is as good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as in a church; yet I was a great while before I could be per&s;uaded, but at length married we were, and my landlady and her daughter were called up to be at the wedding. Afterwards we were all very merry the whole evening, and yet not a &s;ervant knew any thing of it in the hou&s;e, for the land|lord was afraid the mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h &s;hould hear of it: but in the morning it was known, and the landlord blazened it out, and &s;aid we were married before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; there, and being formerly his gue&s;ts came to his hou&s;e to have the wedding-&s;upper.</P>
<P>The next day an odd accident happened, which inter|rupted all my mirth, for as I was looking out of the window, I &s;aw three gentlemen ride by and go into an inn almo&s;t again&s;t us, one of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> be my I|ri&s;h hu&s;band, which frightened me to death; I never was in &s;uch a con&s;ternation in my life, and remained in that condition two hours, but at la&s;t, to my great &s;atisfaction, I &s;aw them all three ride away We&s;tward, and a little af|ter, we were alarmed with a great uproar in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, with a hue and cry after three highwaymen that had

<P>This is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> another day, which was agreeable enough to me I fearing my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> acquaintance &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> chance to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">; but the next day we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> away, and my landlord with three country fel|lows with fire arms, attended us to Dun&s;table, from whence we proceeded to London, and I lived in the ut|mo&s;t tranquility five years with him, for he was an hon|e&s;t, virtuous, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an, and diligent in his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But a &s;udden blew bla&s;ted all my happine&s;s, and turn|ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> out into the world in a wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> condition than I ever had been in before; for my hu&s;band having tru&s;ted one of his fellow clerks with a &s;um of money, two much for our fortunes to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ar the lo&s;s of, the clerk failed, and it fell very heavily on my hu&s;band; yet it was not &s;o great but that if he has courage he might have recovered it, but he grew melancholy and di&s;con&s;olate upon it, and died &s;oon after.</P>
<P>I had two children by him, and was left in a deplora|ble condition, for I was now forty eight years old, and the time was over with me ever to be courted for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and I was become the mo&s;t dejected di&s;con&s;olate creature in the world be&s;ide I was friendle&s;s and help|le&s;s and what was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. I was left in &s;o mean a condi|tion, that I fore&s;aw, what was left would not &s;upport me and my children long.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s I lived two years, and had no friend to comfort or advi&s;e me, till at length I put off my hou&s;e and took lodgings, and &s;old mo&s;t of my goods, which put a little money in my pocket, upon which I lived nearly a year, when one day dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf, but I knew not for what rea&s;on, the devil directed me to be &s;ure to
<PB N="53" REF="049057_0052_10264DB53945CDE0">
an apothecary's &s;hop in L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">denhall-&s;treet, where I &s;aw a little bundle on a &s;tool, and the boy looking another way, I took it away and went off with it, no-body &s;eeing me, which when I came to open, I found there was a &s;uit of child-bed linen in it, a &s;ilver porringer, and a &s;mall &s;ilver mug, and &s;ix &s;poons, and a good &s;hift and three &s;ilk handkerchiefs, and in them &s;ixteen &s;hillings and &s;ix pence in money; but all the while I was opening them, I was under &s;uch dreadful impre&s;&s;ions of mind that I cannot expre&s;s the manner of it; but my own di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;oon &s;i|lenced all reflections; and I went out the next day, not knowing where to &s;teer my cour&s;e; till my old friend the devil, threw a &s;nare in my way again; for meeting with a pretty little child in Aldergate-&s;treet, who had been at a dancing-&s;chool, and was going home, I took it by the hand, and led it into an alley near Bartholemew-clo&s;e, and robbed it of a gold necklace, and &s;o went off with it leaving the poor child to &s;hift for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay but this execrable deed did &s;ometimes trouble me, but I grew harden'd and pa&s;t any remor&s;e of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The next thing of moment, was an attempt I made upon a gentle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oman's gold-watch, as &s;he was coming out of a meeting-hou&s;e, when giving it a pull, and find|ing it would not come I let it go, and crying out as if I had been kill'd, and &s;aid there were pick pockets, for &s;ome body had given a pull at my watch; which I had no &s;ooner done, than the gentlewoman cry'd pick-pock|et too, for &s;ome body had tried to pull her watch away, and at that in&s;tant they di&s;covered a pick-pocket whom they took in the act, and committed him to the mob, which is a cruelty I deed not de&s;cribe, but what they had much rather undergo than be &s;ent to Newgate, all which happened very luckily for me, for thereby I went away undi&s;covered.</P>
<P>The Barthelomew following I went to the cloi&s;ters, and fell into one of the raffling-&s;hops, where I met with a gentleman well dre&s;t and very rich, who &s;ingled me out, and told he would put in for me to raffle, and I getting a muff, he pre&s;ented it to me, and continued
<PB N="54" REF="049057_0053_10264DB7FAF25500">
talking to me very re&s;pectfully, till at length drew me out to walk in the cloi&s;ter, with him, where he told me he was charmed with my company, and a&s;ked me if I dur&s;t tru&s;t my&s;elf in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with him, which after &s;ome importunity I yielded to. He carried me to &s;pring-gar|den at Knightforidge, where we drank very freely, and by that time we got to London it was nearly ten o'clock at night, when we &s;topt at a hou&s;e wherein he was acquainted, and they made to &s;cruple to &s;hew us up &s;tairs into a room with a bed in it. Here he began to be a little free with me, and I by little and little yielded to every thing, till he did what he plea&s;ed with me, and about one o'clock, he drinking freely all the while we went into the coach again, where he was for doing what he had done before; but I finding him in drink, thought my game &s;ecure, and bade him &s;it &s;till a little, which he did, and in a minute fell a&s;leep, which I no &s;ooner per|ceived than I took his gold watch, a &s;ilk pur&s;e of gold, and a &s;nuff-box, and gently opening the door, got away and came home to my governe&s;s; with whom I then lodged, telling her what I had done, which plea&s;ed her wonderfully, &s;aying child, this u&s;age may, for ought I know, reform this gentleman more than all the &s;ermons he ever heard in his life.</P>
<P>Another time I placed my&s;elf at a ware hou&s;e by the water &s;ide, where comes a young fellow with a letter, and wanted a box and a hamper that came from New-ca&s;tle upon Ty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e; but the warehou&s;e-man not being in the way, I read the letter, and ob&s;erved what was in it, bidding him come in the morning, and then he would be &s;ure to meet with him. Away I went and wrote down every particular, and when the warehou&s;e-man came about an hour after, I had the goods delivered without any &s;cruple, which in all was worth about &s;eventy pounds.</P>
<P>After this I had many adventures, and &s;ome of them proved very fortunate; but at length as when doth the pitcher come &s;afely home that goes &s;o often to the well, I met with an unlucky accident which did me no good, altho I knew nothing of the matter. As I was going thro King&s;treet, in Covent-Garden where I heard a

cry of &s;top Thief, and they &s;eeing me, one of them &s;wore I was the widow that was among them, and carried me back to the &s;hop, but the ma&s;ter &s;aid I was not the per&s;on, and would have let me go; but another &s;aid, pray &s;tay, madam, till the journey man comes back for he know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> whether you be the per&s;on or not. In which time the &s;ervants u&s;ed me very fancily tho the con&s;table was by, whom I de&s;ired to let me &s;end for my friends, which he would not agree to, till I came before a ju&s;tice: With that I &s;poke aloud to the ma&s;ter of the &s;hop, and &s;aid, Sir, you know in your own con&s;cience that I am not the per&s;on, and why do you detain me then? which he &s;aid he &s;hould do as yet: I then &s;aid to the con&s;table and porter, he plea&s;ed to remember this; which hard-u&s;age to moved the con&s;table, that he per|&s;uaded him to let me go, but he would not, although the con&s;table told him, he was afraid he &s;hould bring him&s;elf into trouble by it.

<P>I began now to take better heart, and turning to the con&s;table, &s;aid, Let me alone ma&s;ter, let them go on; then the mercer came and begged my pardon, and charged the con&s;table with the right thief; which I told him, he &s;hould find would not do, for if he had di&s;charg|ed me at fir&s;t, when he him&s;elf owned I was not the per&s;on, I would have put it by; but the treatment of him and e&s;pecially of his &s;ervants had been &s;uch, that I was re&s;olved to have reparation: Which he &s;aid he would give me; But I told him, I was not my own judge, and the law &s;hould determine it; for I in&s;i&s;ted to be carried before a magi&s;trate: And he bidding the con&s;table to let me go, he told him it was not in his power; for &s;ince he had already charged me, I mu&s;t be di&s;charged before a magi&s;trate; which being done.

<P>When we came before the ju&s;tice, he a&s;ked me my name, which I told him was Polly Flanders, and that my hu&s;band being a &s;ea captain died in his voyage to Virginia, and that I lodged at pre&s;ent in town, with &s;uch a per&s;on, but that I was preparing to go to Vir|ginia, where my hu&s;band's effects lay; and then I told him how they u&s;ed me, although the ma&s;ter owned I was not the per&s;on that robbed him: all which the con|&s;table confirmed.</P>
<P>Then the ju&s;tice heard the mercer, who made a long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, of the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they daily receive by &s;hop|lifters, and that it was ea&s;y for him to mi&s;take; which being over, the ju&s;tice told me I was di&s;charged, and that he was very &s;orry for what had happened and &s;aid, if I would not forgive them, he mu&s;t bind them over.</P>
<P>I coming home, and telling my governe&s;s the &s;tory, &s;he fell a laughing &s;aying, this job will be the be&s;t bar|gain you ever made in your life if you manage it well you &s;hall make five hundred pounds of it.

<P>I am now drawing towards a new variety of life: in three days after, I ventured into a factor's hou&s;e, where I &s;aw the doors open and all things &s;afe &s;eeing no body in it, where I took up two pieces of flowered &s;ilk, very rich; but as quickly as I was going out I was attacked by two wenches, who came to me open mouthed and &s;hutting the door called the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, to whom I gave very good words, and told them it was my fir&s;t act and being poor, it was a temptation to me to find the door open, which moved the mi&s;tre&s;s to compa&s;&s;ion; but the ma&s;ter grew outrageous, and &s;ent for a con&s;ta|ble, the &s;ight of which &s;truck me with horror, &s;o that I thought I &s;hould &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nk into the ground.</P>
<P>I offered to pay for the pieces, whatever the value was, but all wou'd not do.

crowd of afflictions that I &s;aw there, joined together to make the place &s;eem an emblem of hell it&s;elf, or a kind of entrance into it.</P>
<P>Then I repented of all my life pa&s;t, but it yielded me no &s;atisfaction, no peace, becau&s;e it was repenting after the power of &s;inning was taken away; and was peniten|tial, not that I had &s;inned, but that I was to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>And what added to my afflictions, were the revilings of tho&s;e hardened wretches that were there before me; &s;coffing, what Mrs. Flanders catched in the trap at la&s;t, &s;urely the devil had helped me, or I had been in New|gate long before. Then they welcomed me to the place, and then called for brandy, and drank to me, &s;ay|ing &s;urely I had money, tho they had none.</P>
<P>But nothing could expre&s;s the amazement and &s;ur|prize I was in. when the fir&s;t man that came out I knew to be my Lanca&s;hire hu&s;band, the very &s;ame with whom I lived &s;o well at Dun&s;table and the &s;ame whom I af|terwards &s;aw at Brickhill, when I was married to my la&s;t hu&s;band.</P>
<P>I was &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">auck dumb at the &s;ight of him, and knew nei|ther what to &s;ay, nor what to do; but returning, I cri|ed vehemently for a great while; my own ca&s;e gave me no di&s;turbance, in compari&s;on with his: Oh! &s;aid I, how many poor people have I made mi&s;erable? How many wretches have I &s;ent to the devil? And this misfortune I placed all to my account, reproaching my&s;elf for it.</P>
<P>While I was under the&s;e influences of &s;orrow for him, came notice to me, that the next &s;e&s;&s;ions I &s;hould cer|tainly be tried for my life at the Old-Baily, which &s;oon abated the hardened &s;pirit I had acquired by long con|tinuance in Newgate: and I became dejected to the la&s;t degree, &s;ending for my old governe&s;s who, to give her her due, left no &s;tone unturned to prevent the grand|jury's finding the bill, but it would not prevail. I could hear nothing about the pri&s;on, but every one pitying me, and &s;aying, Mrs. Flanders will be hanged; and at la&s;t one of the keepers came to me, and &s;aid, Mrs. Flanders! What do you intend to do? you will be tried on Fri|day: I wont flatter you, I would have you prepare for death; for as you are an old offender, I doubt you will

find but little mercy. Which was &s;uch a &s;tab to me, that I could not &s;peak a word; and he left me in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion imaginable.</P>
<P>Well! there was no remedy. On Thur&s;day I was carried down to the &s;e&s;&s;ion to be arraigned for &s;tealing two pieces of &s;ilk, value forty pounds, where I pleaded not guilty, the next day I was appointed to be tried, which, when it came on, I would have &s;poken, but they told me the witne&s;&s;es mu&s;t be heard fir&s;t, and then I &s;hould have time to be heard. The witne&s;&s;es were a couple of hard-mouthed jades, for they aggravated eve|ry thing to the utmo&s;t; and although what they &s;aid was true in fact, yet I in&s;i&s;ted that they &s;topped me, be|fore I was out of the hou&s;e, and that I went in with a de&s;ign to buy, but &s;eeing no body in the hou&s;e, I took them, and was going to the door to look at them.</P>
<P>In &s;hort I was found guilty of the felony, but acquit|ted of the burglary, and the next day was carried down to receive the dreadful &s;entence; when being a&s;ked what I had to &s;ay, I told them, I had nothing to &s;ay but to be&s;peak the mercy of the court, that I had broken no doors, had carried nothing off, and that the pro&s;ecutor having lo&s;t nothing, had de&s;ired mercy might be &s;hewn me, and added al&s;o, that it was my fir&s;t offence; all which I &s;poke in &s;uch a pitiful tone, that it moved many in the court to pity.</P>
<P>The judges were grave and mute, and gave me leave to &s;ay what I could, but at length one of them pro|nounced &s;entence of death upon me, which was almo&s;t as bad as death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is more ea&s;ily to be imagined than expre&s;&s;ed, what trouble I was in; I had nothing before me but death, and expected my name in the dead-warrant every day.</P>
<P>In the mean time my governe&s;s &s;ent me mini&s;ter who was a very good man indeed, and he exhorted me &s;eriou&s;ly to repent, and not dally any longer with my &s;oul; which was the fir&s;t time I felt any real &s;igns of repentance, beginning to look back upon my pa&s;t life which abhorrence, and have a view to eternity.

<P>About a month afterwards, there was a rumour that I &s;hould be included in the dead warrant next &s;e&s;&s;ions; but through the indu&s;try and application of the good mini&s;ter, it was changed to tran&s;portation, which was bad enough, but &s;omething better than death and that day five weeks I went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> board a &s;hip with a gang of fifteen as hardened villains as ever Newgate produced.</P>
<P>When we came on board, we were all clapt under the hatches the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ight, which I thought would have &s;uffocated me; and the next morning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">hip fell down the river to Bugby's-hole, where we were by turns per|mitted to come upon deck.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="049057_0060_10264DC95033B868">
All that night I lay upon the hard deck, but had af|terwards a cabin allowed me to put my bed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. When it was my turn to come up, I a&s;ked one of the officers, if I might not be allowed to &s;end a letter, to let my friends know where we lay, which the boat&s;wain told me very civily I might; and when the boat went off, he told me if I would give him the letter he would take care of it. I gave him the letter, and a &s;hilling, which I took out of a pur&s;e, in which I had a pretty deal of money, taking care to let him &s;ee it, which I found af|terwards, was no di&s;advantage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me.</P>
<P>He delivered my letter to my governe&s;s, and brought me back an an&s;wer, giving me the &s;hilling again, and a&s;ked me whether that gentlewoman were my &s;i&s;ter? I told him, no, but one of my be&s;t friends, and would give an hundred pounds to deliver me from this condition.

In the mean time, my governe&s;s went to my hu&s;|band, and &s;oon came to me, and brought me a &s;ea-bed and all its furniture, a &s;ea-che&s;t, and what money I de+&s;igned to take with me, to redeem me when I came on &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re as al&s;o a letter from my hu&s;band, who told me he had al&s;o received a &s;entence of tran&s;portation, but he que&s;tioned whether they would give him leave to go in what &s;hip he plea&s;ed, and that if they did, he feared it could not be obtained time enough to go with me; which troubled me very much, and I was forced to let my governe&s;s into the whole affair, except that of his being my hu&s;band. I told her, I had made an agreement to go with him, if po&s;&s;ible, and that when we came there, how we de&s;igned to plant, &s;ettle, and grow rich, without any more adventures; which plea&s;ed my governe&s;s very much, &s;o that &s;he made it her bu&s;ine&s;s to get him deliv|ered in time.</P>
<P>When my hu&s;band came on board, he looked with a dejected countenance, but afterwards he began to be cheerful; and told me what money he had when he came to the pri&s;on, but &s;aid, the making of friends, and &s;oliciting his ca&s;e, had been expen&s;ive; and that he had
<PB N="62" REF="049057_0061_10264DCE58FB8DB8">
but an hundred and eight pounds left which was in gold.</P>
<P>I gave him an account of my &s;tock then as faithfully, that is, what I had taken with me, which was 246l, &s;o that we had 354l, between us; but a wor&s;e gotten e&s;tate was never put together to begin the world with, it being all in money, an unprofitable cargo to be carried to the plantations.</P>
<P>In this condition we &s;et &s;ail from Bugby's hole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Grave&s;end, where we lay about ten days, and then &s;et &s;ail for the Downs; and from thence we got &s;afely on the coa&s;t of Virginia in two and forty days. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> up the great river Potomack where we got our goods on &s;hore, and lodged them in a &s;tore-hou&s;e, and then after &s;ettling with the captain, I began to enquire after my mother and brother, when I heard &s;he was dead, but he was alive, and lived in a plantation ju&s;t by the place where we landed.</P>
<P>I went with a woman who was my guide, to enquire after him, as if I had only a de&s;ire to &s;ee the country, and coming near the hou&s;e, I a&s;ked the woman, Who&s;e plan|tetion that was? who an&s;wered, there's the gentleman who owns it, and his father with him.</P>
<P>You may gue&s;s what a confu&s;ion I was in, betwixt joy and grief, however, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d about my face, and ventured to go nearer to him; but I need not have taken all that caution, for he was grown dim-&s;ighted; yet fearing to di&s;cover my&s;elf, I fell down on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and wept; the woman perceiving this thought I was not well, and begged of me, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e from the ground; and to divert me, &s;he began to tell the &s;tory. How that old gentleman going to England, fell in love with a young lady and married her, and brought her over to his mother, with whom &s;he lived &s;everal years, and had that young gentleman by her? but after &s;ome time, the daughter-in-law being very much &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;omething the mother had told her and upon inquiry, finding &s;he was her daughter, would not live with him, but went away for England and had not &s;ince been heard of. This relation troubled me &s;o much, that I could &s;carcely bear the hearing of it; but cheering up a little, a&s;ked in what

circum&s;tances the old woman died, and to whom &s;he had left what &s;he had, who an&s;wered, that &s;he had left that plantation to her daughter, if ever &s;he could be heard of; which was good news enough for me, and I was &s;atisfied with this account But it was &s;ome time before I could re&s;olve on making my&s;elf known; but knowing that there was no other way of recovering the plan|tation, I at length &s;ent a me&s;&s;age with a letter to my brother, di&s;covering who I was, and de&s;iring to &s;ee my &s;on; but my brother not being at home, his &s;on opened and read it; and taking a hor&s;e and &s;ervant, came with a me&s;&s;enger to the place where I was, which was about &s;even miles off.</P>
<P>I cannot expre&s;s the joy of my &s;oul, when I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound that he came not as a &s;tranger, but a &s;on, and a &s;on who had never before known what a mother of his own was. After our mutual embraces, he told me that what his grand-mother had left me was in his hands, and that he would do me ju&s;tice to my full &s;atisfaction; that his fa|ther had become very infirm, and that he would leave to me either to di&s;cover my&s;elf to him or let it be &s;till a &s;e|cret.</P>
<P>We then &s;ettled on a plantation near his own, where he provided for me with great care, calling me his aunt; and here I lived &s;o happily, that I began to wi&s;h I had not brought my Lanca&s;hire hu&s;band with me from Eng|land. But we went on pro&s;perou&s;ly for a long time, and managed our plantation very well, until my hu&s;band di|ed; and my brother dying the &s;ame year, I went to live with my &s;on, willing to him the plantation, which his grand-mother willed to me.</P>
<P>And now being on the la&s;t &s;tage of my life, I began &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect on the pa&s;t follies and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">edne&s;s thereof, truly repenting of all my former &s;ins and trans|gre&s;&s;ions, and to &s;hew an utter abhorance of tho&s;e vices of which I had been too frequently guilty.
