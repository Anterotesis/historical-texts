<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>To tho&s;e who are acquainted with the merit of Mr. Berquin's fir&s;t publication, for the u&s;e of Children, which he ju&s;tly entitled the</HI> CHILDREN'S FRIEND, <HI>it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to advance any other circum&s;tance in favour of the following work, than that it is the production of the &s;ame Gentleman, by whom that elegant and moral performance was given to the world. Being calculated for the peru&s;al of Children of a tender age, it naturally admitted a kind of Sequel or Counterpart, for the in&s;truction and en|tertainment of young per&s;ons, who are rather pa&s;t the period of childhood, and yet may be &s;uppo&s;ed incapable of thinking for them&s;elves. The following Sheets contain what has hitherto been publi&s;hed entire by the Author, on this plan, under the title of</HI> THE FRIEND OF YOUTH. <HI>It is nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved, that this work, in the original, came out, as did the</HI> Children's Friend, <HI>in detached periodical pieces, and therefore has not yet arrived at the ultimate point to which Mr. B. propo&s;es to continue it. Neverthele&s;s, it was thought more advi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">able, to gratify the impatience of the public, with what is fini&s;hed of in, than to wait the uncertain arrival of the little which remains to be added.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In order to make amends far this deficiency, what|ever it may be, the Tran&s;lator has joined the Hi&s;tory of</HI> Little Grandi&s;on, <HI>(from which an extract is previ|ou&s;ly given in the fir&s;t volume) to the pieces which com|po&s;e the Friend of Youth. It was tran&s;lated from the Dutch by Mr. B. who found it to po&s;&s;e&s;s nearly the &s;ame &s;pirit with his own works, and, therefore,</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="045437_0003_101FFABF38B5A3A0">
<HI>judged it a proper pre&s;ent for tho&s;e readers to whom be had dedicated his pen. This Gentleman's laudable indu&s;try, has led him to examine the productions of &s;everal modern languages, and from them, to &s;elect &s;uch as appeared to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e which he had in view. Among the re&s;t, he has introduced, in the fol|lowing collection, a piece or two from the Engli&s;h, of which it will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that they are here in&s;erted in the language of the &s;everal originals to which they belonged, as being obviou&s;ly the mo&s;t natu|ral dre&s;s that they could a&s;&s;ume, and beyond compari|&s;on, the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory to an Engli&s;h reader. No tran&s;lation can be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of conveying the &s;pirit and freedom of the original: and this would be found particularly to be the ca&s;e in the latter of the pieces alluded to,</HI> The Narrative of a Shipwreck on the I&s;land of Cape-Breton, <HI>which opens the &s;e|cond volume. The &s;ubject of this narrative being partly nautical, it would be &s;ound to &s;uffer con&s;idera|bly, and appear to much le&s;s advantage, if delivered in any other &s;tyle than the Engli&s;h, in which it was fir&s;t compo&s;ed. Indeed, the ab&s;urdity of tran&s;la|ting from a foreign language, what would be read with infinitely more &s;atisfaction as an original, is &s;o apparent, that it does not require any further comment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If a critical in&s;pection of this work &s;hould di&s;cover &s;ome of the pieces, in their pre&s;ent form, to contain, now and then, a &s;light improbability, it will, no doubt, be attributed to its real cau&s;e, the difference of national manners. The effect of this circum&s;tance is &s;o important, that a &s;mall defect of probability could not ab&s;olutely be avoided in &s;ome ca&s;es, without mili|tating again&s;t both the intent and moral of the Au|thor,
<PB N="v" REF="045437_0004_101FFAC1C7AB3DD8">
as well as deranging the whole plot and conduct of many of his pieces. An imperfection, which will always be found to &s;ub&s;i&s;t inherently in every perform|ance like the following, where it is propo&s;ed to adopt, for in&s;tance, French manners and actions to Engli&s;h characters. A copyi&s;t in painting, would, probably, often find it a difficult ta&s;k to &s;upport the propriety of any particular action repre&s;ented in a picture, were he obliged to alter the</HI> co&s;tum&eacute; <HI>of the figures exhi|bited in the original. Thus, it may be pre&s;umed, the picture of an Augu&s;tan Triumph would not &s;o &s;trong|ly impre&s;s the &s;pectator with an idea of grandeur, were the per&s;onages in the proce&s;&s;ion habited like Dutchmen: or, on the other hand, if a company of Roman Senators were repre&s;ented as bu&s;ily engaged in the fanta&s;tical chace of a Pantomime, the mummery of the action would no longer be pre&s;erved, but mu&s;t unavoidably be overclouded with a ca&s;t of &s;olemnity un|natural to it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Imaginary actions, therefore, when adapted to one particular national character, are not ea&s;ily transfer|able; or, whenever it is attempted to make them &s;o, either the action or the character, is liable to &s;uffer a partial di&s;gui&s;e, and be &s;een, as it were, through a mi&s;t. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, they will, neither of them, af|fect the imagination of the reader with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters">ively a force, as when they appear with the advantage of their orginal congruity. But this ob&s;ervation applies more con&s;picuou&s;ly to Novels, where a &s;ingle moral re&s;ults from a &s;eries of complicated actions inter&s;per|&s;ed, perhaps, with a variety of epi&s;odes appending to the main &s;tory. I know not whether</HI> Gil Blas, <HI>the</HI> Fortunate Villager, <HI>and a few other novels, may not be adduced as in&s;tances to elucidate what has been a|bove
<PB N="vi" REF="045437_0005_101FFAC352569C50">
remarked: but in a work like the pre&s;ent, con|&s;i&s;ting of &s;hort pieces, in which we quickly arrive at the moral, and find it generally to con&s;titute the mo&s;t leading feature, it is not &s;o difficult to accommodate the manners and actions of each per&s;onage, to the ge|neral uniformity of human life, and to dive&s;t them of that</HI> nationality <HI>which would be more ob&s;ervable in narrative pieces of greater extent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Upon the whole, it lies with the judicious reader to determine, whether any con&s;iderable offences again&s;t veri&s;imilitude occur, in the following collection. The Tran&s;lator hopes he has rea&s;on to con&s;ole him&s;elf in the reflection, that he has u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible diligence to avoid any &s;uch; and if, notwith&s;tanding his endeavours, the cen&s;ure of critici&s;m &s;hould fa&s;ten on a few imperfecti|ons of this nature,</HI> quas aut incuria fudit,</P>
<P>Aut humana parum cavit Natura, <HI>he has only to &s;helter him&s;elf behind the well-earned reputation of the Author, who&s;e labours, &s;o eminently beneficial to youth in general, he has endeavoured par|ticularly to adapt to the improvement of the ri&s;ing ge|neration in this country.</HI></P>

THE FRIEND OF YOUTH.</HEAD>
<DIV1 TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>THE FICKLE YOUTH.</HEAD>
<P>JACK WHIRLER was endowed, by nature, with a happy memory, a ripe under&s;tanding, and a lively, active, and fruitful imagination. Fortune &s;eemed to en&s;ure the accompli&s;hment of every hope, that could be founded upon &s;o pro|mi&s;ing qualities, by allotting him parents, who&s;e warme&s;t wi&s;hes ever were, to cultivate, in their &s;on, that pregnancy of parts, which he had re|ceived from the hands of nature. An extraor|dinary quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion had advanced him, con&s;iderably, in his tender &s;tudies, at an early period, and he was already eager to unite the ornament of exterior accompli&s;hments, to the more &s;olid acquirement of mental in&s;truction.</P>
<P>It happened, that, on a vi&s;it to one of his young companions, he found him engaged in drawing a Roman head, which, from the charac|teri&s;tic greatne&s;s of the countenance, impre&s;&s;ed him with the mo&s;t lively &s;entiments of admira|tion. As his friend advanced toward the fini&s;h|ing of his portrait, young Whirler felt the&s;e &s;en|timents grow in his mind with additional ardor. Some other pieces, which the room afforded in the &s;ame &s;tyle, completely in&s;pired him with &s;uch
<PB N="10" REF="045437_0008_101FFAE0A2599828">
an enthu&s;ia&s;m as Raphael experienced on fir&s;t taking the pencil in his hand.</P>
<P>He returned home at full &s;peed, and, meeting his father on the &s;tairs, he threw his arms fond|ly round him, and reque&s;ted him to go immedi|ately, and engage him a drawing ma&s;ter. His father, charmed with the earne&s;tne&s;s that he ex|pre&s;&s;ed, was ea&s;ily induced to gratify this de&s;ire. They went, therefore, together, to the mo&s;t ce|lebrated ma&s;ter in town; and Jack Whirler would have been happy, could he have prevailed on him to give up all his other pupils, and confine his in&s;tructions to him alone, from morning to night. As he could not obtain this &s;acrifice, he in&s;i&s;ted, however, that each le&s;&s;on &s;hould conti|nue, at lea&s;t, two hours every day. He had no conception, how any one could refrain from de|voting every moment of his life, to the cultiva|tion of &s;o divine an art.</P>
<P>His ma&s;ter was not to come until the next day. I will not tell you how many faces he had &s;ketched before night. His port-folio was already full of beads, drawn in every po&s;&s;ible variety of character, though you will certainly excu&s;e him, if they did not di&s;cover that correctne&s;s which is the re&s;ult of lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> practice. There was, perhaps, a large eye, to match a &s;mall one, in the &s;ame face; the no&s;e was made, &s;ometimes, to ri&s;e out from the middle of the forehead, and the ear would come to hear the mouth, or the mouth to bite the ear, acro&s;s the whole breadth of the cheek: but, except the&s;e trifling faults, his performance had all the correctne&s;s that could be rea&s;onably expected.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="045437_0009_1020273828C45EF0">
He had, him&s;elf, prepared an enormous &s;heet of paper, the large&s;t that was to be had in town. This was &s;oon found too &s;mall to contain the number of eyes, ears, arms and legs, that he had &s;ketched out under the direction of his ma&s;|ter. The ho&s;pitals of Greenwich and Chel&s;ea, would here have met with excellent patterns to replace all the lo&s;t members of tho&s;e hone&s;t ve|terans who inhabit them. His natural impati|ence was a little fretted by the tedious &s;amene&s;s of tho&s;e e&s;&s;ays, to which, his fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons were ri|gidly confined, in order to &s;teady his hand. As &s;oon, therefore, as he was alone, he launched out freely, beyond the bounds of this &s;low pro|ce&s;s, a&s;piring already in idea, to the execution of complete and grand pictures. The garret-walls had been newly white-wa&s;hed; he formed the de&s;ign of painting them with the hi&s;tory of Rome, which he was ju&s;t then reading at &s;chool; and, in effect, at the week's end, there appeared drawn upon them, in charcoal, a comely &s;ucce&s;&s;i|on of heads and bu&s;ts of tribunes and of con|&s;uls, with dictators a-foot, and emperors on hor&s;eback; and I doubt not, that if the names had been placed under their re&s;pective figures, in order to render them perfect re&s;emblances, an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">quary might have found means to bring forth a number of intere&s;ting and learned remarks, touching this gallery.</P>
<P>He was propo&s;ing to him&s;elf to repre&s;ent, in the &s;ame &s;tyle of execution, the progre&s;s of our hi&s;tory, down from the conque&s;t, when he one day found his whole work effaced by the &s;ervants,
<PB N="12" REF="045437_0010_10202739B5416858">
who pretended, that the&s;e Roman heroes upon the wall only frightened the cats, but did not drive the mice away. This mi&s;hap a little aba|ted the ardor of his pa&s;&s;ion for drawing: his di&s;appointment at &s;eeing him&s;elf &s;till far behind his young friend, whom he had expected at his fir&s;t attempt to overtake, alienated &s;till more his liking for the art. He pre&s;ently grew fearful of dirtying his fingers with the chalks, or, of making gaps in his pen-knife, by cutting them. His ma&s;ter, who at fir&s;t had &s;o much trouble to moderate his eagerne&s;s, now found it a more difficult ta&s;k to re-animate it. In vain, did he enumerate to him the wonderful effects of paint|ing; and the curious anecdotes that are found in the lives of the great arti&s;ts. He had introduced to him, a pupil of his, ju&s;t returned from Rome; on purpo&s;e to entertain him with an account of the &s;uperb paintings that he had &s;een and &s;tudied in Italy. This young gentleman, in expre&s;&s;ing his admiration of tho&s;e performances, made u&s;e of Italian words, either as being more ready, or more &s;ignificant; the founds were new to Jack Whirler's ears; and it &s;truck him in a moment, that to &s;peak &s;o melodious a language was a much finer thing, than to draw heads; which, let them be ever &s;o expre&s;&s;ive, could not talk. He ran immediately to communicate this reflection to his father, who, though grieved to &s;ee him thus quit an agreeable accompli&s;hment, of which he had before been &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;irous, did not however chu&s;e to oppo&s;e this new ta&s;te of his; and the next day, Jack Whirler had an Italian ma&s;ter, in the room of his teacher in drawing.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="045437_0011_1020273B6A224910">
I mu&s;t do Jack the ju&s;tice thus publicly to de|clare that his progre&s;s for the fir&s;t two or three days kept pace with his re&s;olution. Every gram|matical difficulty gave way to the quickne&s;s of his comprehen&s;ion. He grew fond to enthu&s;i|a&s;m of a language &s;o full of &s;weetne&s;s and har|mony; and was ince&s;&s;antly talking it to the peo|ple of the family, without troubling his head whether they could under&s;tand it. He addre&s;&s;ed the cockmaid with <HI>Vo&s;tra Signoria,</HI> and called the gardener <HI>Cor mio.</HI> The Italian tran&s;lation of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Tragedy of Cato, written by Mr. Addi&s;on, was tran&s;lated into Italian by Salvini, and acted at Flo|rence.</NOTE> Cato became as familiar to him as the original. In examining his father's library for authors in this language, he laid his hands by chance on a Spani&s;h Don Quixote. Don Quixote! the fa|vorite of his earlie&s;t &s;tudies! Oh! what a plea|&s;ure to be able to ta&s;te the droll proverbs of his hone&s;t '&s;quire, when &s;ea&s;oned with all the hu|mour of their native language! Cato's grave &s;o|liloquy was not to be compared to the delectable &s;allies of Sancho; nor the little &s;enate of Uti|ca, to the council-chamber of the Baratarian go|vernor. This undertaking, however, required courage. Here he was to engage ince&s;&s;antly with &s;trange words, like the knight of the rueful vi|llage with windmills and flocks of &s;heep. He came off, however, with at lea&s;t as much honor as the knight in this fir&s;t campaign. But will you believe me? Before the hero of La Mancha had &s;allied forth a &s;econd time in que&s;t of adven|tures,
<PB N="14" REF="045437_0012_1020273CFB690BA0">
Jack Whirler had quitted the Spani&s;h to learn French, which he &s;oon gave up in order to &s;tudy the German. So that at the end of the year he was already a &s;matterer in four living lan|guages, but &s;o imperfect was he in each, and jumbled them together in his di&s;cour&s;e after &s;uch a fa&s;hion, that he &s;hould have had an audience compo&s;ed of deputies from the&s;e different nati|ons, to interpret one to the other the unconnect|ed &s;craps and phra&s;es that each might happen to under&s;tand in his conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Dexterity in exerci&s;es of the body &s;eems to lend both help and ornament to a well cultivated mind, and the mo&s;t exten&s;ive knowledge will not atone for awkwardne&s;s, in the eyes of the fairer part of &s;ociety. Jack Whirler had met with a di&s;agreeable proof of this, at a ball which was given by his papa on &s;ome particular occa&s;ion. In the cour&s;e of this, Jack, notwith&s;tanding his erudition, had put all the dancers out &s;everal times. He therefore re&s;olved to in&s;truct him&s;elf in the principles of this agreeable art; but &s;carce|ly had he begun the minuet &s;teps, when his head ran upon the rigadoon, and nothing el&s;e. What he mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to learn in each le&s;&s;on was exactly the part of dancing that he &s;hould not be taught as yet. Always eager after what he did not know, and di&s;&s;atisfied with what he had learned, he could lay up nothing in his me|mory with the lea&s;t order. Thus he would &s;ometimes <HI>figure in</HI> when he &s;hould <HI>cro&s;s over,</HI> and <HI>&s;huffle</HI> when he &s;hould <HI>&s;ink.</HI> He found no diffi|culty in dancing the hays when the company &s;et out with a cotillion, nor had he ever occa&s;ion for
<PB N="15" REF="045437_0013_1020273EB9FCCD88">
a change of time in the mu&s;ic to &s;tart off him|&s;elf in a Scotch reel, while he left his partner moving a minuet.</P>
<P>All this, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, produced no &s;mall confu&s;ion among the young people his companions of the dance; in order therefore to rein&s;tate him&s;elf in the favor of the ladies, which he had lo&s;t by this ab&s;ent and volatile di&s;|po&s;ition, he &s;et about learning mu&s;ic, that he might be able to accompany either the voice or the harp&s;ichord. But what in&s;trument &s;hould he attempt fir&s;t? To take his word for it, there was nothing ea&s;ier in the world than to practi&s;e them all at once. However his father did not think proper to ri&s;k this experiment, and gave him only the liberty of chu&s;ing his in&s;trument. While he was uncertain as to this point, the vi|olin &s;eemed a proper one to take in hand by way of trial, and it was not till &s;ix months after, that he fixed his choice decidedly on the flute, ju&s;t as he began to attempt an open &s;hake, and to bow with tolerable &s;teadine&s;s.</P>
<P>In the mean time his father grew &s;omewhat unea&s;y on ob&s;erving this un&s;ettled and change|able di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;on, though a parent's fond|ne&s;s induced him to attribute the fault to youth alone. With a view therefore to advance the improvement of his under&s;tanding by ob&s;ervation and experience, he determined to &s;end him upon a tour to the continent. Jack Whirler de&s;ired no better than to &s;hift the &s;cene. The narra|tives of travellers had always been a favorite reading with him, and his imagination had a thou&s;and times tran&s;ported him to the countries
<PB N="16" REF="045437_0014_10202747A844A7A0">
which they de&s;cribe. A young friend of his, who was ju&s;t returned from France, gave him &s;o favorable an account of the reception that he had found in that country, and drew &s;o plea&s;|ing a picture of the improved &s;tate of arts and &s;ociety there; de&s;cribed in &s;o warm terms the engaging vivacity and elegance of the ladies, with the frank and open politene&s;s of the men; offered him &s;uch flattering letters of recommen|dation to &s;ome of the nobility at Paris, equally eminent for exalted talents and amiable qualities; in fine, the happy effects already produced by the commercial union of the two nations, and the pro&s;pect opened to both of enriching them&s;elves by a free and reciprocal interchange of their pro|ductions, and of pre&s;erving the repo&s;e of Europe by the envied example of their happine&s;s, as well as by the terror of their arms; all the&s;e ideas, united in de&s;cription, did &s;o inflame his natural enthu&s;ia&s;m, that he could not contain his de&s;ire of vi&s;iting that polite nation; nor was it po&s;&s;ible to moderate his joy, when the moment arrived that he was to &s;et out, under the direc|tion of a preceptor, equally remarkable for his good &s;en&s;e and attachment to the family of his pupil.</P>
<P>One &s;hould have viewed the exten&s;ive plains of Picardy, inter&s;per&s;ed with the agreeable land|&s;cape of di&s;tant hamlets, or &s;loping hills crown|ed with orchards and hopyards in full bloom, to conceive the impre&s;&s;ion which this enchanting &s;ight produced on the mind of our young travel|ler. Even the rapidity of <HI>his</HI> imagination could &s;carcely keep pace with the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;triking
<PB N="17" REF="045437_0015_1020274935CE0C40">
objects which his tour afforded. A continued rapture of admiration conducted him to the gates of Paris, where it was &s;till further heigh|tened by a view of the &s;uperb palaces and other magnificent buildings which adorn that capital. The fir&s;t few days after his arrival, he &s;pent in viewing every quarter of it. The grandeur of the public edifices, the innumerable concour&s;e of inhabitants, the delicious gardens which abound both in the city and its environs, the &s;plendor and elegance that &s;hone in the dre&s;&s;es of the no|bility, the &s;ightly decorations of their places of public re&s;ort, and the unbounded fe&s;tivity that reigns in their private and convivial circles; all the&s;e charms united, might be &s;uppo&s;ed, with the addition of novelty, to produce &s;en&s;ations pro|portionable to the ardour and &s;u&s;ceptibility which young Whirler's imagination po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>So they did at fir&s;t; but the impre&s;&s;ion, lively as it was, &s;oon vani&s;hed. His eager curio&s;ity once &s;atisfied, he felt this pa&s;&s;ion &s;ucceeded by languor and &s;atiety. His tutor perceived it, and propo&s;ed to him to vi&s;it &s;ome of the provinces. Jack Whirler, in the height of his joy, could on|ly an&s;wer him by pre&s;&s;ing entreaties to engage a po&s;t-chai&s;e for that purpo&s;e again&s;t the next day.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not follow them in the whole of their excur&s;ion, for fear of growing tire&s;ome to my young reader; I will only &s;top with them a mo|ment at Salency, a town celebrated for the per|formance of a ceremony the mo&s;t affecting and &s;ingular, that perhaps the whole world can afford, in this age of degeneracy. There the younger female inhabitants are early in&s;pired with the

love, and encouraged in the practice of truth, probity, and innocence. She who is by univer|&s;al con&s;ent pronounced the mo&s;t virtuous maiden of the village, receives from the hands of its il|lu&s;trious proprietor a crown of ro&s;es; which ho|nour is conferred once a year, on a day that is ob&s;erved as a fe&s;tival from the public celebration of the cu&s;tom; and this ornament, &s;imple as it is, bath more powerful and univer&s;al effect on the morals of the ri&s;ing generation, particularly the female part of the pea&s;antry of Salency, than the mo&s;t laboured or o&s;tentatious panegy|ric, the warme&s;t effu&s;ions of popular applau&s;e, or in fine, than any other incentive what&s;oever, up|on tho&s;e of their &s;uperior; in rank and under|&s;tanding. There virtue and merit are habitually revered, and the acqui&s;ition of the ro&s;e garland, the reward of unblemi&s;hed &s;ame and purity of manners, is viewed with more hone&s;t and more ju&s;tly founded emulation, than trophies of mili|tary prowe&s;s, or the tin&s;el decoration and titles of a &s;tate&s;man, can excite in the bo&s;oms of the great.</P>
<P>Objects attractive and intere&s;ting &s;urrounded Jack Whirler in every part of his tour; he found every where a &s;ufficient variety of matter both for in&s;truction and amu&s;ement; but it was the misfortune of his di&s;po&s;ition never to wi&s;h for anything but what was out of his reach, and ne|ver to think any place agreeable, unle&s;s he were a hundred leagues di&s;tant from it. What mo&s;t employed his thoughts during this tour in France, was, (as he &s;ometimes termed it in a rapture) his <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> Italy. In the Louvre at Paris, he looked
<PB N="19" REF="045437_0017_1020274F191639D8">
round for the Roman Capital, or the Temple of the Sun, and was now &s;ighing for the &s;hattered villages of Calabria in the mid&s;t of the vineyards of Champagne. His tutor had tried all po&s;&s;ible means to cure him of this re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, but &s;oon became apprehen&s;ive, left his endeavours to that purpo&s;e &s;hould only &s;erve to throw his pupil into a con&s;umption, and therefore he &s;econded the re|que&s;t which the latter had made to his father for permi&s;&s;ion to &s;et out for this &s;ame Italy, which he now longed to behold as much as ever the wan|dering Trojans did in the days of yore.</P>
<P>Except in cro&s;&s;ing the channel, all Jack Whir|ler's travels had hitherto been upon dry land, and it was now two months &s;ince he had begun mea|&s;uring the po&s;t-roads of France. This was e|nough to put him out of humour with all tra|velling unle&s;s by &s;ea. His tutor conceived hopes of bringing him to a rea&s;onable di&s;po&s;ition by a|greeing to the experiment, and pretended to re|li&s;h it as much as he did. They embarked there|fore at Mar&s;eilles, on board a ve&s;&s;el bound to Leghorn.</P>
<P>Jack Whirler pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t day entirely upon deck, where he could not help admiring the waves of the &s;ea, which were gently impelled by the wind, and &s;eemed to come in playful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;porting round the &s;hip's &s;ides. The next day he was &s;till &s;o clever in his own eyes for having had the courage to undertake this expedition, that his &s;elf-complacent reflexions on the &s;ubject kept off the approaches of &s;atiety. But the third day, both his agreeable mu&s;ing on the beau|ties of the &s;ea, and his &s;atisfaction in thinking &s;o
<PB N="20" REF="045437_0018_102027536AFD3020">
highly of him&s;elf, quite for&s;ook him. Nothing remained but the weari&s;ome di&s;gu&s;t that he felt in the &s;amene&s;s of his voyage. He now longed to be on &s;hore, all the wi&s;hes of his heart were directed towards the land: but unfortunately it was too far off to gratify his caprice. Nor did old ocean &s;eem to u&s;e any extraordinary ha&s;te in tran&s;porting him to the term of his wi&s;hes, &s;o that he was obliged to be patient, or rather (as his temper inclined him) to be out of patience, until the &s;hip's arrival at her port.</P>
<P>Happy power of imagination, which, through the &s;weet illu&s;ions of hope, &s;teals from us the remembrance of our troubles! Jack Whirler forgot all his at his landing. He was now at length happily arrived in that famous country, the &s;tore|hou&s;e of all the riches both of nature and art. After repo&s;ing him&s;elf two days at Leghorn, he &s;et out for Florence. He knew that the famous gallery of paintings in that city made it the re|&s;ort of travellers, many of whom, even after continually viewing it for &s;ix months, found their curio&s;ity &s;till un&s;atisfied, and remained in town in &s;pite of their re&s;olutions of departing every day. This did not &s;eem &s;o &s;trange to him at his fir&s;t ca&s;ting his eye upon that &s;uperb col|lection of ma&s;ter-pieces. Perhaps he would even have remained in the &s;ame mind until he had got to the end of the gallery, if it had not been for the idea of St. Peter's at Rome, and the Vatican Library, that ju&s;t then &s;truck him. The&s;e two edifices took up his thoughts the whole day, and pre&s;ented them&s;elves in unbounded magnificence to his imagination. In order to form a deci&s;ive
<PB N="21" REF="045437_0019_102027565A35A3F8">
e&s;timate of their &s;plendour and dimen&s;ions, he pre&s;&s;ed his tutor that &s;ame evening to &s;et off for Rome. Never tell me of tho&s;e tedious travellers that pry without end, and take an age to exa|mine any remarkable object! Jack Whirler, in three days, had &s;een every thing that was curious in the antient capital of the world, and had even &s;ome of that time to &s;pare, which he employed in putting together his baggage for a trip to Na|ples, whither he was already tran&s;ported in idea. It was not however the particular beauties of this latter place which excited his curio&s;ity &s;o &s;trong|ly; he had lately, it is true, pa&s;&s;ed through many magnificent cities, but all that he had hi|therto &s;een were above the &s;urface of the earth, whereas Herculaneum and Pompeia were buried in its bowels. Cities under ground were all that he now thought worth his notice. The roman|tic fruitfulne&s;s of his imagination formed to him a thou&s;and pictures of the terrible event which had reduced them to that &s;tate. He was &s;ur|pri&s;ed, on going down among&s;t their ruins, to find that he had fallen in love with a heap of rub|bi&s;h; for he &s;aw nothing more at that time, notwith&s;tanding the many curious remains of antiquity that have been di&s;covered among them. Another would at lea&s;t have found &s;ome con&s;olation in admiring, at Naples, one of the fine&s;t harbours in Europe, but Jack Whirler could not help contra&s;ting it with tho&s;e of Am|&s;terdam, Port&s;mouth, or Con&s;tantinople; which appeared to him much finer, becau&s;e they were at a di&s;tance. As to that burning mountain which commands the town of Naples, and makes
<PB N="22" REF="045437_0020_10202757E777F548">
its &s;ituation awful, as well as picture&s;que, by in|ce&s;&s;antly threatening to bury it in a&s;hes and flames; did not all travellers allow AEtna to be far before Ve&s;uvius? Certainly; and the dread|ful effects of its la&s;t eruption conveyed to his mind every idea of terror and admiration that a vul|cano can excite. Thus in that dear country which Jack Whirler had &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired to vi&s;it, there remained but one &s;ingle town, the &s;ight of which could recompen&s;e the fatigues of his journey. This was Venice, &s;o &s;ingularly different from all the other cities, ri&s;ing from the middle of a huge mora&s;s, with her canals, her gondolas, and her five hundred bridges. To ar|rive there, he mu&s;t travel, it is true, the whole length of Italy, but his imagination, as it was bold in &s;moothing every ob&s;tacle, &s;o it was clear-&s;ighted in &s;hortening every di&s;tance, and he only waited to have his portmanteau packed up, that he might take the road towards Venice.</P>
<P>I am afraid, my young friends, that you have before now &s;u&s;pected his tutor to have been too tamely complai&s;ant, as you have &s;een him give way to all his pupil's whims. I &s;ee that to ju&s;|tify him, I mu&s;t here di&s;cover to you a family &s;e|cret, repo&s;ing at the &s;ame time the &s;tricte&s;t confi|dence in your di&s;cretion. During the whole of his tour, Jack Whirler had written home regu|larly to his father, who remarked, that his letters always expre&s;&s;ed a &s;ort of di&s;gu&s;t for the place from which they were dated, while he &s;eemed in raptures with that which he was next to vi&s;it: thus it appeared that every country, though it pre&s;ented him at a di&s;tance with flattering pro|&s;pects,
<PB N="23" REF="045437_0021_1020275C2B955558">
never failed to &s;end him away tired and di&s;appointed. The&s;e remarks, confirmed by tho&s;e of his &s;on's tutor, which after what you have read, you may ea&s;ily imagine were quite to the &s;ame effect, gave him to under&s;tand, that his &s;on was not of a temper or frame of mind cal|culated to receive much improvement from tra|velling. However, he did not chu&s;e, by ha&s;tily recalling him, to furni&s;h him with a pretext for complaining at a future period, that he had there|by lo&s;t the opportunity of improvement. He barely recommended to the tutor not to oppo&s;e his &s;on's changeable whims, which would of them&s;elves be &s;ufficient to bring him home in a &s;hort time. Thus Jack Whirler, after he had &s;een Venice, Turin, Switzerland and Flanders, all at full &s;peed, did now, in a fre&s;h fit of incon|&s;tancy, wi&s;h for no more than to return to his own fire-&s;ide, even before the time which he him|&s;elf had &s;tipulated.</P>
<P>A parent never forgets that name: you may imagine, therefore, what Mr. Whirler felt at the return of his &s;on. But why have I not here tho&s;e tran&s;ports of joy to de&s;cribe to you, which po&s;&s;e&s;s a father's heart, when a child, worthy of his warme&s;t affection, is re&s;tored to him after ab|&s;ence? Why can I not repre&s;ent them to you, cla&s;ped in each other's arms, &s;peechle&s;s with joy, and mixing their tears together; the father proud of the new accompli&s;hments that he ob&s;erves in his &s;on, and the latter happy to &s;hew them to ad|vantage before the eyes of a parent, as the pro|pere&s;t return that he could make to his fatherly affection and good wi&s;hes? How happy &s;hould I
<PB N="24" REF="045437_0022_1020275F1FA691D0">
have been to lay before you &s;o touching a &s;cene, even though it &s;hould lo&s;e by my de&s;cription! You would at lea&s;t, as well as your parents, have ob&s;erved in it, with plea&s;ure, the artle&s;s expre&s;&s;i|on of tho&s;e &s;entiments with which you feel your|&s;elves mutually affected. It was in Jack Whirl|er's power to have made us all thus happy, by a better improvement of the attention that had been paid to his earlier years. Nothing would have been wanting to his education, either as to learning or accompli&s;hments, if he could have had the re&s;olution to conquer the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, and confine him&s;elf to a more con&s;tant and uniform cour&s;e of application. In|&s;tead of that fickle ta&s;te which hurried him from one &s;tudy to another, wading through the diffi|culties that render the beginning of each dry and di&s;agreeable, and never taking time to enjoy the &s;atisfaction which a more advanced progre&s;s affords; in&s;tead of tho&s;e delu&s;ions of fancy, which dre&s;&s;ed out di&s;tant objects in a flattering manner, only to make tho&s;e which were pre&s;ent, appear in more unfavorable colours; in&s;tead of being perpetually di&s;gu&s;ted and out of humour with the &s;aint, un&s;atisfactory ideas, which a clo&s;e in&s;pection afforded him, of objects that his ima|gination had exaggerated while at a di&s;tance; what a fund of &s;incere plea&s;ing ideas might he have laid up for him&s;elf! Not to mention the delight which a youth of &s;pirit feels in out&s;trip|ping the expectations of his family, how great would have been his &s;atisfaction in this import|ant re&s;pect, that the fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t principle of nature would have made his improvement the
<PB N="25" REF="045437_0023_10202760ABA32480">
&s;ource of happine&s;s to his parents, in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite degree!</P>
<P>You have &s;een Jack Whirler, from his child|hood equally fond of learning and agreeable ac|compli&s;hments, &s;et out in pur&s;uit of them with the mo&s;t unbounded eagerne&s;s, and thinking to carry every thing at the fir&s;t attempt, &s;truggle gallantly with the mo&s;t di&s;heartening difficulties for a while, and then give up the conte&s;t at the very moment when he was about to get the bet|ter of them. In addition to his natural de&s;ire of knowledge, and the encouraging applau&s;e of his parents, had he been endowed with a little more command over him&s;elf, he might have ac|quired every thing that would add ornament as well as happine&s;s to his future life. His rea&s;on early matured by &s;tudy, and his ta&s;te for agreeable relaxations would have pre&s;erved his youth from that re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s which torments him, and from that weari&s;ome di&s;gu&s;t which he conceives to every object that becomes once familiar to him. From his acquaintance with both the principles and practice of the fine arts, he would have looked upon nothing with indifference in the cour&s;e of his travels. The view of tho&s;e ma&s;ter|pieces of art which foreign countries afford, while it gratified his curio&s;ity, would have improved his ta&s;te. His under&s;tanding would have been enlightened by the variety of objects that met his view, his judgment corrected by &s;tudying their differences and relations, his knowledge of the world enlarged by ob&s;erving the manners and characters of men in different countries. Strangers, flattered with the de&s;ire which
<PB N="26" REF="045437_0024_10202763ED8D8B78">
a youth of education te&s;tifies to vi&s;it their country, conceive the mo&s;t advantageous pre|judice in his favor, and receive him with the polite&s;t attention. Thus admitted into every di&s;tingui&s;hed circle, he might have done honour to his name and country, by that manly frankne&s;s and &s;incerity of manners which I would recom|mend to my young countrymen as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential accompaniment to politene&s;s, ina&s;much as it certainly be&s;t conciliates friend&s;hip, e&s;teem, and re&s;pect. He would have returned home re|gretted by tho&s;e whom he had left, welcomed by his former friends, and doubly &s;o by his parents, to whom he would then have afforded the mo&s;t rea&s;onable ground of hope for his future &s;ucce&s;s in life.</P>
<P>How far was Jack Whirler from this happy &s;ituation, to which his circum&s;tances &s;eemed &s;o naturally to lead him! In all the towns through which he had travelled at full &s;peed, his con|ver&s;ation was chiefly with the landlords of the hotels where he took a &s;hort repo&s;e after the fatigues of riding po&s;t. His countrymen had little to promi&s;e them&s;elves from the feeble &s;tock of information that he had collected; his father &s;aw all his hopes di&s;appointed; and his friends&mdash;but his ficklene&s;s was incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch a re|lation&mdash;Jack Whirler had no friends. Unhappy youth! I pity him when I think, my dear Ho|ratio, that our friend&s;hip was formed at an age as tender; our friend&s;hip, which has never &s;ince wavered a &s;ingle moment, and which would now, as in the fir&s;t warmth of its commencement, lead us to unite our lives and fortunes, and &s;hare them
<PB N="27" REF="045437_0025_1020276857C05280">
for the future equally and in&s;eparably! Sweet moments of our youth! when the &s;ame &s;enti|ments and inclinations drew our hearts together by every tie that could bind them. How &s;wiftly did the days glide away between our &s;tudies, and the free intercour&s;e of our &s;entiments! Every plea&s;ure, every pain was felt by both in common. Always together in town, together in the coun|try; for eight years we felt it nece&s;&s;ary to our happine&s;s to be &s;o, and what tears did our &s;epa|ration co&s;t us! At this day, if we chance to wan|der to tho&s;e charming walks by the &s;ide of a plea&s;ant rivulet, or up &s;ome romantic hill, where formerly, with a Shake&s;peare, a Fenelon, or a Gold&s;mith in our hands, we &s;o oft enjoyed at once the charms of friend&s;hip, of poetry, and of nature, how plea&s;ing &s;till to find our mutual &s;en|timents ever the &s;ame, and to repo&s;e in a firm confidence that nothing but death can extingui&s;h them in us.</P>
<P>O you, my young readers, who are witne&s;&s;es to this effu&s;ion of my heart, if you have a friend like mine, if you love him, and are beloved by him as I am, you will pardon it. Be&s;ides, have I not a right of &s;peaking to you concerning what|ever intere&s;ts my feelings? Otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have a&s;&s;umed in vain, the title under which I of|fer you this work. Whatever affects either you or me, can never henceforward be indifferent to the other party. We are united by ties that can never be broken on either &s;ide, without a gro&s;s want of gratitude. If the care which I take in forming your hearts and under&s;tandings have any value in your eyes, I on my &s;ide owe you my

<HEAD>THE CAVERN IN THE PEAK</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">De&s;cribed in the relation of a TRAVELLER.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD left London behind me a hundred and &s;eventy miles, and had cro&s;&s;ed &s;everal moun|tains and vallies, when at length I &s;aw my&s;elf near the end of my journey, being arrived in the wilds of Derby&s;hire.</P>
<P>The mountains which I had now to climb grew more &s;teep and difficult; and behind them I de&s;erted others &s;till higher, that were totally bate of trees, and pre&s;ented a &s;urface of heath and green&s;ward, &s;o that at a pretty good di&s;tance I could di&s;tingui&s;h the flocks feeding upon their &s;ides.</P>
<P>When I had reached the top of one of the&s;e mountains, I was all at once &s;urprized with the &s;ight of a delightful valley below me, inter&s;ected with rivulets, and &s;urrounded on all &s;ides with lofty hills. At the bottom of this valley is &s;itu|ated the village of Ca&s;tletown, con&s;i&s;ting of a few indifferent cottages, that &s;eem to announce the poverty of their inhabitants.</P>
<P>A narrow road winding down the declivity of the mountain, conducted me to the bottom of the valley, and &s;o into the village, where having &s;topped a moment at an inn to refre&s;h my&s;elf, I took the road towards the Cavern of the Peak,
<PB N="41" REF="045437_0039_102027908D0A45A8">
being guided to its entrance by a &s;mall &s;tream that runs near it, after having pa&s;&s;ed through the town.</P>
<P>I &s;topped now and then in order to indulge my eyes with a more lei&s;urely view of the &s;ingu|lar object before me. Between two groves of the fine&s;t verdure, an enormous rock, crowned with the ruins of an ancient ca&s;tle, reared its ton to the very clouds. At the foot of this opened a va&s;t Cavern, which, when viewed from with|out, while the beholder enjoys the light of noon|day, pre&s;ents to his eyes a huge aby&s;s of dark|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>A man &s;oon appeared at the mouth of the Cave, who a&s;ked me if I cho&s;e to go down. I followed him down an ea&s;y de&s;cent, the day|light, which came in at the entrance, gradually lo&s;ing it&s;elf in a &s;ort of <HI>darkne&s;s vi&s;ible,</HI> &s;omething like the faint twilight of a November evening.</P>
<P>After we had advanced a few &s;teps, I was much &s;urprized to &s;ee on my right hand, a &s;ubterrane|ous town under the immen&s;e vault of the rock. It happened to be a holiday, and the inhabitants were enjoying a relaxation from their labors, mo&s;t of them &s;itting with their children before the doors of their cottages, and amu&s;ing them|&s;elves. I gue&s;&s;ed the nature of their u&s;ual em|ployment to be &s;pinning, from the number of large wheels that were every where to be &s;een.</P>
<P>As we went farther in, the opening which &s;till admitted the feeble light of day, &s;eemed to nar|row more and more, and &s;oon appeared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> large hole in the rock, while the rays <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="42" REF="045437_0040_1020279375BC5518">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as they were, gave a tinge to the &s;moke that ro&s;e from tho&s;e &s;ubterraneous cottages which we had left behind. The gloom, however, thick|ened every &s;tep, till at length the vault of the rock, and the darkne&s;s, both together, &s;eemed to enclo&s;e all round.</P>
<P>My guide, who was before me, then opened the door of a &s;mall cabin cut in the hollow of the rock, and an old woman, who lived in it, came out and furni&s;hed us with lights. Each of us took one, and we continued our march, be|ing obliged however to &s;toop very low for a con|&s;iderable length of way. But what was my a&s;|toni&s;hment when, at the end of this clo&s;e pa&s;|&s;age, I &s;aw the Cavern widen round me all at once, and the vault ri&s;e to a height which we could not di&s;tingui&s;h by the help of our lights. I pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilence through the extent of this ca|vity, like a benighted traveller that has lo&s;t his way, and arrived at length on the &s;ide of a pret|ty broad &s;tream, who&s;e &s;ilent waters, when our candles approached their &s;urface, threw all round us a pale reflexion of light, that was &s;till more full of horror than the darkne&s;s. A &s;mall boat was made fa&s;t to the bank, and my guide, bid|ding me enter it, jumped into the water up to his middle, and taking the rope of the boat over his &s;houlders, began to drag it after him.</P>
<P>The &s;till horror of this place re&s;embled the &s;i|lence of the grave. As I advanced I &s;aw the roof of the rock become gradually lower, like a dark cloud de&s;cending towards the earth. My guide cried out to me to lie down on my back; and I had &s;carcely been a moment in that po&s;ture,
<PB N="43" REF="045437_0041_10202797BB0B2C60">
when I found my&s;elf under a part of the vault &s;o low, that &s;tretched as I was at full length in the boat, I could &s;carcely hold the candle upright by my &s;ide. While I was thus buried as it were, I confe&s;s the &s;tories of the river Styx, and of Cha|ron's ferry-boat, began to appear not quite &s;o fa|bulous. I &s;eemed as in a dream, going to land in the gloomy regions of Erebus, condemned by an unu&s;ual de&s;tiny to carry my own funeral torch. Fortunately this dreary vi&s;ion did not la&s;t long, we &s;oon cro&s;&s;ed the &s;treights, and I landed alive and well on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide.</P>
<P>The vault over our heads pre&s;ented us once more in our walk with the &s;ame irregular &s;urface, &s;ometimes ri&s;ing to a prodigious height, and &s;ometimes &s;inking all at once as if to &s;top up our way. I perceived all round me a number of plants and &s;mall animals petrified, and would willingly have examined them, but I was obliged to decline the gratification of my curio&s;ity, for fear of burning out our candles.</P>
<P>A &s;econd piece of water appearing before us, I imagined that we were now arrived at the end of our journey, as I &s;aw no boat. This &s;tream was not &s;o broad as the former; we could ea&s;ily di&s;|tingui&s;h the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. My conductor took me upon his back, and carried me &s;afe over.</P>
<P>A little farther we found a &s;mall current which ran parallel with our path. Our ground here became moi&s;t and &s;lippery, and our path &s;o nar|row that we could hardly get one foot before the other. Yet, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e and &s;uch di&s;agreeable ob&s;tacles, I followed with plea&s;ure the cour&s;e of the &s;ubterraneous water. Every
<PB N="44" REF="045437_0042_1020279AA5AEB698">
object that I could di&s;cover, in this empire of darkne&s;s, appeared to me to carry with it &s;ome|thing of the marvellous. My mind was lo&s;t in a chaos of agreeable mu&s;ings, when &s;uddenly a murmur of di&s;tant harmony &s;truck my ear.</P>
<P>I &s;topped my guide, and a&s;ked him whence the&s;e &s;ounds proceeded, which my fancy (already in a romantic mood) repre&s;ented to me &s;o delight|ful? He an&s;wered me that I would &s;oon &s;atisfy my&s;elf. Each &s;tep that I advanced, this mur|mur, which at a di&s;tance was indi&s;tinct and con|fu&s;ed, grew more articulate. I pre&s;ently di&s;tin|gui&s;hed a &s;ort of pattering noi&s;e, like that made by drops of rain. It was no more than a &s;mall water-fall, the &s;tream of which &s;eparating as it fell, came down in a thick &s;hower; and the noi&s;e of this, prolonged from echo to echo, through the &s;ilent vault, formed, by its mingled and gra|dual reverberation, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ounds full of harmony. I could already &s;ee the&s;e drops &s;par|kle like diamonds at the approach of our candles, but I did not dare to go too near them, for fear of &s;eeing our candles go out, and of being redu|ced to grope our way back in the dark, perhaps un&s;ucce&s;sfully.</P>
<P>In the &s;ides of the rock, at different places, I ob&s;erved large openings, which led probably to other caverns. I barely peeped into them, and was &s;orry that my time would not permit me to explore them thoroughly. My guide, in order to give me an agreeable &s;urprize, bid me &s;hut my eyes, and &s;uffer him to lead me. I gave him my candle, and holding him by the coat, followed him blindfold. He &s;topped &s;hort, and when I
<PB N="45" REF="045437_0043_1020279C2F492DC8">
opened my eyes, I found my&s;elf in an augu&s;t temple, the dome of which, irregularly &s;u&s;pended upon enormous pillars, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all that awful beauty and magnificence, which is &s;een in the great works of nature. I could not help falling on my knees to adore the maje&s;ty of the Almigh|ty, who &s;eemed to have formed even this &s;ubter|raneous &s;pot, as a temple where he might be fit|ly wor&s;hipped.</P>
<P>I quitted this contemplation with reluctance, in order to continue our expedition, which was now drawing to a period. The faithful &s;tream conducted us to the extremity of the Cavern, where the rock bends down for the la&s;t time. Its arch de&s;cends to the very waters, where it unites with them, and clo&s;es up the pa&s;&s;age &s;o complete|ly, that the mo&s;t adventurous traveller cannot pa&s;s the bounds which here &s;et to his curio|&s;ity.</P>
<P>We now therefore turned back, and as I im|agined, were to come out by the &s;ame path by which we had penetrated thus far; but I very &s;oon &s;aw my guide turn off to the left, by one of the lateral openings of the rock. He gave me notice that I &s;hould find my&s;elf much fatigued in this new expedition, and mu&s;t be &s;atisfied to creep for &s;ome length under a part of the rock which nearly touches the ground. As he found me re&s;olved to follow him, he advi&s;ed me to take good care of my candle.</P>
<P>We were obliged to creep on our hands and feet for a pretty long time, upon a moi&s;t &s;and, the pa&s;&s;age being &s;ometimes &s;o &s;treight, that we could hardly &s;queeze our bodies through. When
<PB N="46" REF="045437_0044_102027A0D76699C0">
I ro&s;e from this painful po&s;ture, I &s;aw a &s;teep hill full before me, the top of which &s;eemed to lo&s;e it&s;elf like a cloud, among the hardly di&s;tingui&s;h|able extremities of the &s;urrounding rock. The a&s;cent was &s;o &s;teep from its moi&s;ture, that I fell back at every &s;tep. My guide, more active at this exerci&s;e, took me by the hand, and at length &s;ucceeded in helping me to the top. I &s;hudder|ed at &s;ight of the depths which &s;urrounded me on all &s;ides. He bid me &s;it down, and reque&s;ted me to wait for his return. Leaving me there|fore in this &s;olitude, he de&s;cended the hill pretty rapidly, and was &s;oon lo&s;t to my view. All at once I &s;aw re-appear, not him, but his light, which &s;hone like a &s;park in an aby&s;s of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>After &s;uffering me to enjoy this &s;pectacle for a moment, my guide returned: I went down with him to the &s;ame depth where I had before lo&s;t &s;ight of him. He now rea&s;cended the hill, and through an opening in the rock, he gave me a view of his candle, while I removed mine. It was to me as if, in the darke&s;t night, I &s;aw a &s;in|gle &s;tar twinkle in the narrow &s;pace between two dark clouds.</P>
<P>This part not offering any fre&s;h objects to gratify my curio&s;ity, we re-entered our former creeping pa&s;&s;age, in order to arrive once more on the bank of the &s;mall &s;tream which now conduct|ed us back. I beheld the wild temple again with the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion of awe; I heard with the &s;ame plea&s;ure, the harmonious murmur of the ca&s;cade; but I repa&s;&s;ed with le&s;s terror beneath the vault which my fancy had before compared
<PB N="47" REF="045437_0045_102027A40BD213C8">
to a tomb. I con&s;idered my&s;elf as The&s;eus re|turning victorious from his expedition to Hell: and how great was my joy, when, after the vener|able Sibyl had extingui&s;hed the remainder of our candles, which we returned to her, I at length di&s;covered the feeble gleam of day! How I ble&s;|&s;ed it, after &s;o long a confinement in darkne&s;s!</P>
<P>I now came chearfully forward amid&s;t a very picture&s;que di&s;tribution of light and &s;hade. At every &s;tep I &s;aw the veil of darkne&s;s gradually unfold. As the opening of the Cavern enlarg|ed, it gave me an idea of Aurora, opening the &s;plendid portals of the dawn. I arrived in the light as in a new world, where the &s;un now a|waited me on the borders of the We&s;t, &s;urround|ed with clouds of purple and gold, to contra&s;t, as it were, by the grandeur of &s;uch a &s;pectacle, the gloomy objects which were &s;till pictured in my memory.</P>

<HEAD>THE PEASANT, HIS COUNTRY'S BENEFACTOR.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Stanley, tired with the noi&s;e and bu&s;tle of the town, had purcha&s;ed a &s;mall coun|tryhou&s;e, in which he promi&s;ed to him&s;elf the en|joyment of rural tranquillity, amid&s;t the &s;tudy of books and the exerci&s;e of benevolence. Being naturally of a pen&s;ive turn, he was fond of &s;oli|tude and the amu&s;ement of walking, in which he occa&s;ionally indulged him&s;elf in all the quar|ters round his new habitation. One day, his wandering &s;teps led him to a &s;mall valley the &s;ight of which alone was &s;ufficient highly to gratify his contemplative inclination. Surrounded by high hills, the &s;lopes of which pre&s;ented an agree|able variety of corn fields, groves and cottages, it &s;eemed to be the retreat of rural happine&s;s. The &s;tillne&s;s of this retired vale was only inter|rupted by the murmuring found of a rivulet,
<PB N="52" REF="045437_0050_102027B2A1390140">
which falling down a rock, reflected from its broken waters all the colors of the rainbow, as the &s;un's rays enlightened it at a certain ele|vation. Its froth expanded in white volumes round the ba&s;on which it had hollowed out by its fall. The rivulet afterwards divided it&s;elf into &s;everal &s;maller ones which inter&s;ected the valley in many directions, and fre&s;hened the verdure of the meadows by their beneficent con|tributions of moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>Yet the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations of Mr. Stan|ley's brea&s;t were not occa&s;ioned merely by the natural beauties of the &s;pot. The whole extent of the valley was covered with new cottages, each having its &s;mall farm annexed, with an orchard and kitchen garden. The&s;e parcels of land were only &s;eparated by plain goo&s;eberry hedges, which &s;eemed at once to indicate the value of the ground and the mutual confidence of the inha|bitants. Mr. Stanley rejoiced to &s;ee that no &s;ingle per&s;on had engro&s;&s;ed to him&s;elf the whole of this delicious plain. He was plea&s;ed in the reflexion that many families might there enjoy the &s;weets of ea&s;e and tranquillity. While he in his own mind, congratulated the owner of the land, who had a number of &s;o happy tenants, he thought &s;ome prai&s;e was al&s;o due to his bene|ficence, which had certainly, by its encourage|ment and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, occa&s;ioned the rich &s;peci|men of cultivation that he admired. So wholly was he rapt in meditation upon this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, that he had not ob&s;erved the gathering of thick dark clouds that was forming over his
<PB N="53" REF="045437_0051_102027B2A1390140">
head. A &s;hower of rain, accompanied with lightning, &s;oon obliged him to &s;eek for &s;helter. He ran therefore and knocked at the door of the fir&s;t cottage, which was opened by a woman far advanced in years, but who&s;e countenance old age had made venerable. She received him in a free and friendly manner. I am very glad, &s;aid &s;he, that our cottage happened to be the neare&s;t to you, though, I am pretty &s;ure, our children would have received you kindly too. As the &s;torm &s;urprized you in the middle of the plain, you could hardly mi&s;s of applying for &s;helter to &s;ome one or other of our family. But I &s;ee, you are quite out of breath. Compo&s;e your&s;elf. I will make up a good fire for you, that you may dry your&s;elf by it.</P>
<P>While &s;he was laying on &s;ome wood, Mr. Stanley was looking about him very attentively. He ob&s;erved an appearance of plenty and regu|larity in the di&s;po&s;ition of the furniture, that plea&s;ed him very much. He had under&s;tood, by the good woman's words, that a great part of the habitations of the plain was occupied by her chil|dren. His curio&s;ity was rou&s;ed by the circum|&s;tance, and he was preparing to a&s;k a few que&s;ti|ons in order to &s;atisfy it, when he heard &s;omebo|dy from the inner room &s;ay, "I hope, dame, you will make the gentleman welcome." "Yes, yes, gaffer, an&s;wered &s;he, never fear."&mdash;"That is your hu&s;band, then, that &s;peaks to you," &s;ays Mr. Stanley. "Yes, Sir, he is within there, in that room."&mdash;"Will you give me leave to pay my re&s;pects to him?" "And welcome, Sir; you will perhaps be glad to know each other; walk

in." Mr. Stanley entered, and perceived an old man lying in a bed, the covering of which was remarkably neat. His head was bare; his locks, white as &s;now, fell down to his &s;houlders; his countenance, which time had re&s;pected, was ex|pre&s;&s;ive of the tranquillity and goodne&s;s of his &s;oul; there was a &s;mile upon his lips, and his eyes &s;parkled with the fire and vivacity of youth. Mr. Stanley, attracted by an exterior &s;o prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing, approached him.</P>

<P>Tired? I'faith, I have &s;omewhat el&s;e to do than to be tired. It is only my limbs that are out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; my head is &s;till employ|ed. The thoughts of ten children, and fifty grand children and great grand children, will &s;carce let my time hang heavy. There are not too many hours in the day to think of &s;o many people.

<P>Have you many of them here?</P>

<P>Only two grand-daughters. I could as &s;oon quarter a regiment as lodge them all. It was not my cabin, but my lands that I wi&s;hed to enlarge. I thank God, I have been able to give a pretty parcel of land to each of them, without hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing my&s;elf. There was a good deal of ground hereabouts that had been impoveri&s;hed; it was let to me at a low rent. I took care fir&s;t to put it into good heart again, and
<PB N="56" REF="045437_0054_102027BD4E10B158">

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Stanley.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in this great number of children has none ever cau&s;ed you any &s;orrow?</P>

<P>Sometimes, by their &s;ickne&s;s; but I have always been able to recover them by re|gular diet and &s;imples with which I am acquaint|ed. In other re&s;pects they have always made me happy.</P>

<P>Apparently becau&s;e you have always given them a good example.</P>

<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare take upon me to &s;ay &s;o. When I was young, to be &s;ure, I was all alive, like other folks; I ran about to every wake and revel; but as &s;oon as I had once pronounced the &s;olemn word <HI>I will,</HI> in church, I left off all tho&s;e youthful tricks. Happily my wife was hand|&s;ome, good-natured and virtuous. That keeps a man in awe. Be&s;ides, children began to come on apace. I was not rich at the time, and it I had been &s;ufficiently &s;o for my&s;elf, I had affection enough for my family, to wi&s;h them al&s;o a com|petency. I trained my children up to work ve|ry young. I carried them to the fields as &s;oon as they could walk. The younge&s;t I &s;eated upon the plough, while the re&s;t played round about us. My daughters amu&s;ed us with &s;inging, while they &s;pun at their wheel. In &s;hort, I taught them all to work chearfully for their bread, that they might eat it happily.</P>

<P>See them Sir? When I was light|er, I u&s;ed to go my rounds among them once a

week, to &s;ee that every thing went on well in their families. Now, when I cannot go out, it is their turn to vi&s;it me. Every Sunday after pray|ers, my daughters, my grand-daughters, and my daughters-in-law, bring their children here.

The&s;e all vie with each other in their fondne&s;s to me; and their chil|dren have a certain family re&s;emblance that charms me. I have generally a dozen of them in my arms and playing about me.

wrinkles, and his ro&s;y complexion, which I have no longer in my cheeks. And indeed he is my Benjamin, the darling of my heart. I can tell you &s;o much, Sir, as you are a &s;tranger, but I &s;hould not wi&s;h that any of the family knew it.</P>

<P>If I have not tho&s;e, I have others. Having never been from this part of the coun|try, I know it as well as I do my own cabin, and all the inhabitants likewi&s;e. I have been at the birth of them all. They come to con&s;ult me about laying down their grounds. They have only to bring me a ba&s;ket of the earth of each farm. I handle it, and ta&s;te it, and tell at once what &s;ort of grain it will produce be&s;t. If they are poor folks, I lend them &s;eed, which they pay me after the harve&s;t; and I prevail upon tho&s;e whom I have &s;erved, to lend them a day's work, which is all the return that I a&s;k for my &s;ervices. I have &s;een the time when every one worked only for him&s;elf, and would have thought that he en|riched him&s;elf by ruining his neighbour. I con|trived, however, at length, to per&s;uade them, that the richer the country was, the richer each would be in particular; that the fruits of the earth would &s;ell better, and attract manufacturing peo|ple to this quarter, by the plenty of them and their good quality; and that, in order to effect this, they ought to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other. According as the &s;ea&s;on is wet or dry, the crop of the low grounds is more or le&s;s forward th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n that of the uplands. I prevail upon them to unite and be|gin

with the fir&s;t ripe; thus the whole is got in at its ju&s;t point of maturity. In fact, you may enquire at the markets all round concerning our grain. The factors &s;trive which &s;hall buy it up. Sometimes they come and take it in the crop, and our corn has been &s;old before it was put in|to the ground; whereas if there come ten bu&s;h|els of bad corn from a pari&s;h, it is enough to give all the re&s;t a bad name.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>By degrees, from the experience of each year. Be&s;ides I mu&s;t &s;ay, I have been well a&s;&s;i&s;ted. Our vicar is a &s;en&s;ible man; I had made him as rich as a dean, by the weddings, the chri&s;tenings, and the tithes that I brought him. He &s;ometimes touched upon the good ef|fects of my practice, in his &s;ermons. Be&s;ides, when our head landlord came down to re&s;ide here, he &s;aw his lands quite changed, they let for double the rent; upon which he &s;hewed me marks of his regard. If there was any new ex|periment of agriculture, in your London papers, they will come both of them to con&s;ult me. I made the experiment before their eyes, and as &s;oon as it &s;ucceeded, it was pre&s;ently &s;pread. Far|mers follow their old way, and de&s;pi&s;e any di&s;|coveries taken from books, but tho&s;e that I had approved, there was no contradicting. They put them in practice, and found the good effects of them. Be&s;ides my doctrine is not very long|winded. I deliver the whole of it in a few

<P>It is true, I have taken many a cau&s;e out of his wor&s;hip's hands. I &s;hould be as rich as a judge, if I had only taken a &s;hilling for every di&s;pute that I have &s;ettled. There is always &s;ome little quarrel, in a country village, upon one &s;ubject or another. They come to a&s;k my advice. If one of the parties be at a di&s;tance, they take me in a chai&s;e cart, and convey me to the &s;pot. There upon hearing the merits of the cau&s;e, I endeavor to accom|modate matters &s;atisfactorily. If they refu&s;e to agree, I invite them to come to my hou&s;e again&s;t next day. I have &s;ome excellent old ale, that would &s;often hearts of &s;tone. They ta&s;te it, and as &s;oon as it begins to have its effect upon my di&s;putants, I make them &s;en&s;ible that a law &s;uit would co&s;t them ten times more than the thing in di&s;pute; that they would lo&s;e their time, their money, their re&s;t, and the plea&s;ure of being friends. I mention to them the example of tho&s;e, who, through not taking my advice, have impoveri&s;hed them&s;elves to make lawyers rich. Before the fir&s;t mug of ale is fini&s;hed, they no longer look &s;hy on each other, and the &s;econd is &s;carce half emptied, before they would go through fire to &s;erve each other. Thus I give away my ale, but I get, in return, plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction in this life, and good hopes for that which is to come.</P>

Your name written backwards up there, is a &s;ort of public infamy. Every body &s;huns you, even to the children. You mu&s;t mend your manners, or decamp. If you reform, well and good, I re|ver&s;e your name; in the fir&s;t place, to remove the memory of your di&s;grace, and then to en|courage you in good behaviour. Of twenty names, in all, that I have thus engraved back|wards, there remain but three which will &s;erve as an example for a long time to come; whereas a name written up there, &s;traight forwards, is al|mo&s;t enough to make one a gentleman, and to &s;ee a &s;ingle letter turned backwards, would be as dreadful us death to the party, &s;o great is the ad|vantage of a good reputation.</P>

<P>The old man, who had rai&s;ed him&s;elf up in his bed, to addre&s;s the&s;e words to his Creator, fell back with fatigue as he fini&s;hed them.

However, Mr. Stanley judged that repo&s;e would be nece&s;&s;ary to him, after an emotion &s;o violent, for his age; he therefore thanked the&s;e good people for their ho&s;pitality, and promi&s;ed to come again and &s;ee them, after a few days.</P>

of &s;ociety. Fifty indu&s;trious citizens given to the &s;tate.

<P>MRS. Cro&s;by had retired, in the third year of her widowhood, to a &s;mall, but com|modious hou&s;e, at &s;ome di&s;tance from London. Here &s;he endeavoured to amu&s;e the grief which &s;he felt for the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band, by attending to the education of a daughter whom &s;he regard|ed as the only remaining pledge of their mutual affection. She her&s;elf had been married very young, and her father, when he made an advan|tageous bargain, as it is called, in the di&s;po&s;al of
<PB N="69" REF="045437_0067_102027E3CCC30378">
her hand, imagined that the &s;plendor of a large fortune, and a few &s;hewy accompli&s;hments, would enable her to appear in the world with &s;ufficient di&s;tinction. As he was always invol|ved in the hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s, or engaged in tu|multuous di&s;&s;ipation, he had never reflected, that, in a calmer &s;tate of life, his daughter would have any more occa&s;ion, than him&s;elf, for tho&s;e re|&s;ources of the heart and under&s;tanding, which ari&s;e from a proper cultivation of both, or that the better choice he made of a hu&s;band for her, the more nece&s;&s;ary the&s;e advantages would be to her in order to gain his e&s;teem, and pre&s;erve his attachment. The&s;e con&s;iderations, obvious as they were, never once occurred to him, and of all the cares that he felt for the happine&s;s of his daughter, the mo&s;t u&s;eful were, tho&s;e to which he lea&s;t attended.</P>
<P>It was not long, before Mrs. Cro&s;by felt and regretted this neglect, particularly as &s;he was now placed in the &s;ociety of a man, di&s;tingui&s;hed for delicacy of &s;entiment, and clearne&s;s of under|&s;tanding, and who united a large portion of knowledge, to a refined ta&s;te. While &s;he &s;ought therefore to &s;upply the deficiency of her own e|ducation, &s;he re&s;olved, above all things, to avoid any &s;uch neglect in that of her daughter. The amu&s;ements of town had never totally divert|ed her from this project, and the &s;olitude in which &s;he propo&s;ed to pa&s;s her widowhood, af|forded her there all the lei&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary for put|ting it in execution. She had already taken advantage of the fir&s;t years of Emily's childhood, to perfect her&s;elf in tho&s;e things which &s;he pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="70" REF="045437_0068_102027E6ECA04160">
one day or other to teach her. Her appli|cation and force of memory, her quick and ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion, &s;o well fulfilled the views which her affection had &s;ugge&s;ted, that &s;he was now perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of ancient and modern hi&s;tory, geography and the elements of mathematicks, and had &s;ome general notions of a&s;tronomy and natural philo&s;ophy. In order to be able by her|&s;elf alone to in&s;truct her daughter, &s;he had ac|quired her own knowledge, without any other aid, than good books of introduction to tho&s;e &s;everal &s;ciences. Thus, while &s;he &s;ought for her&s;elf the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and effectual mode of in&s;truction, &s;he &s;tudied beforehand that which would be mo&s;t proper for Emily's under&s;tanding, who&s;e acute|ne&s;s and vivacity, from an infant, afforded the mo&s;t favorable hopes; nor did her &s;ub&s;equent improvement di&s;appoint them. Emily, now &s;carcely thirteen, had already, by her progre&s;s in learning, and her dutiful behavior, began to re|ward the pains which her mother had taken in in&s;tructing her. Their hours were &s;pent in the pure&s;t enjoyment of mutual happine&s;s. The company of a few particular acquaintances in the neighborhood, and the vi&s;its which they &s;ometimes received from their friends in town, were the only interruptions to their &s;tudies, the variety of which, together with the culture of flowers, and the care of their &s;inging-birds, &s;erved as a relaxation to them.</P>
<P>Whether it was to purge her daughter's heart of every &s;entiment of vanity, or to rid her hou&s;e of a load of vi&s;itors, Mrs. Cro&s;by had thought proper to conceal her fortune, and a&s;&s;umed as
<PB N="71" REF="045437_0069_102027EB6C340658">
a pretext for her country retirement, the nece&s;&s;i|ty of retrieving her affairs, by &s;trict oeconomy. Thus, while &s;he avoided the tire&s;ome details and u&s;ele&s;s expen&s;e of a great hou&s;e, &s;he had more time to apply to her labors, and was better able to indulge her genero&s;ity by the private be|nefactions which &s;he &s;o liberally di&s;pen&s;ed. From the tranquility of &s;o agreeable a life, the &s;atis|faction of &s;eeing her daughter equal her hopes, and a good &s;tate of health acquired by exerci&s;e, temperance, and regularity, &s;he had contracted an unchangeable &s;erenity of temper, and &s;uch a &s;prightline&s;s in conver&s;ation, as made her com|pany highly delightful to little Emily. The feelings of her young heart were wholly dedicated to her mamma, and the memory o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> her father which Mrs. Cro&s;by took care to keep up, by the example of her own &s;orrow for his lo&s;s, and by the remembrance that &s;he expre&s;&s;ed of his good qualities. Emily, brought up in all the freedom of ingenuous innocence, had not a thought, that &s;he needed to conceal from her affectionate friend, and therefore had pre&s;erved that amiable &s;implicity, which is the &s;weete&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ornament of rea&s;on. As all her reflections had ari&s;en from what &s;he heard in conver&s;ation with her mother, they were of a lively and animated turn, &s;uch as the warmth of conver&s;ation generally produces, and &s;he delivered her thoughts with equal clear|ne&s;s and force, equal correctne&s;s and vivacity.</P>
<P>Mr. Glanville, brother to Mrs. Cro&s;by, whom &s;he loved affectionately, from a child, was &s;ettled in London, where he held an honourable po&s;t under government; and the duties of this, together with the &s;tudy of natural &s;cience, which
<PB N="72" REF="045437_0070_102027EE5C8E7C60">
he cultivated &s;ucce&s;sfully, were his chief employ|ments. Two daughters, as yet under the fir&s;t cares of their mother, and little George, now twelve years old, made up his family. Amid&s;t the corruption of a capital, his hou&s;e was a &s;tranger to immorality. His &s;on had never been far from his pre&s;ence. Born with a lively ima|gination, an ardent and fearle&s;s &s;pirit, frankne&s;s, genero&s;ity and re&s;olution, George was mild, and at the &s;ame time &s;u&s;ceptible of the mo&s;t impetuous emotions. He was even, at his age, &s;trongly in love with glory, and whatever was great. When he heard an in&s;tance of bravery and genero&s;ity related, you would &s;ee his brea&s;t heave, and the fire &s;parkle in his eyes. While Mr. Glanville conceived the be&s;t hopes, from &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, he was thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the anxiety that it might cau&s;e him. However, his &s;on's tender affection for him, alleviated his fears. He had early accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to manage him by kind|ne&s;s. A cold look would have filled George with terror; a reproach would have been a &s;evere puni&s;hment to him.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of a pre&s;&s;ing invitation, which they both received from Emily's hand, though dictated by her mamma, to &s;pend a few days of the &s;ummer vacation at her hou&s;e, they arrived there, as it happened, the day before her birth-day; the addition of this company made it therefore a &s;ort of fe&s;tival, which Emily adorned by her gra|ces, and George animated by his vivacity. Mrs. Cro&s;by repaid, with tears of joy, the amiable attentions of the&s;e charming children; but this happine&s;s was &s;till more increa&s;ed, when &s;he had an opportunity of di&s;cour&s;ing at freedom with
<PB N="73" REF="045437_0071_102027EFE7834F88">
her brother, of their projects and expectations concerning their children. Dinner time, which a&s;&s;embled them and their young family, was a new &s;cene of delight. After a long &s;eparation, to find them&s;elves once more together, amid&s;t all the beauties of nature, a fine country, and de|lightful weather, and in the pre&s;ence of objects &s;o mutually intere&s;ting! to feel the &s;weet emotions of parental tenderne&s;s, and all the <HI>mingled chari|ties</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Milton.</NOTE> of duty and affection! you would have but a faint idea of their happine&s;s, if you could &s;up|po&s;e that the&s;e terms give an adequate de&s;cription of it.</P>

<P>THE finene&s;s of the evening having invited them to walk out, they went all together upon the terrace. The &s;un was going to &s;et, he was ju&s;t touching the edge of the horizon. Mrs. Cro&s;by, breaking off her di&s;cour&s;e all at once, went and &s;eated her&s;elf on the end of a &s;tone &s;eat which fronted a large walk of the garden. Mr. Glanville, thinking that his &s;i&s;ter was taken ill, made ha&s;te to follow her, and anxiou&s;ly a&s;ked her what was the matter? Nothing at all, an|&s;wered &s;he, &s;miling, but without moving her eyes, which were fixed upon the &s;etting &s;un. I will &s;atisfy your &s;urprize and curio&s;ity in a mo|ment, but fir&s;t let the &s;un di&s;appear.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="045437_0072_102027F330A0D658">
Mr. Glanville, and the children, looked at each other in &s;ilence, not daring to interrupt her. Pre&s;ently the &s;un was out of &s;ight, and Mrs. Cro&s;by then ri&s;ing with a chearful air, I am &s;a|tisfied, &s;ays &s;he, every thing goes on well in the univer&s;e. The&s;e words, and the ha&s;ty manner in which I quitted you ju&s;t now, mu&s;t &s;urprize you; I &s;hall therefore explain. This is, you know, my birth-day. It &s;eems as if every object in nature became this day unu&s;ually intere&s;ting to me. I ob&s;erve with more attention whatever pa&s;&s;es, and every thing affords me matter for re|flection. This morning, as I walked in my or|chard, I endeavored to remark the changes that might have taken place in the trees during the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year. I &s;aw that &s;ome began to lo&s;e their youthful look, and others to &s;ucceed them in &s;tature and vigor. The fir&s;t afforded me a &s;erious le&s;&s;on, but the latter comforted me with a plea&s;ing type of my own youth, renewed in my daughter.</P>
<P>Emily ki&s;&s;ed her mother's hand, and heaved a &s;igh.</P>
<P>That remark, &s;ays Mr. Glanville, plea&s;es me as much for its fortitude and philo&s;ophy, as the &s;entiment which is connected with it, does by its tenderne&s;s. But do your ob&s;ervations reach to the &s;tar of day? were you unea&s;y to know if he had lo&s;t his force or his brightne&s;s?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cro&s;by.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, brother, my thoughts do not extend &s;o far. La&s;t year, on this &s;ame day, I was &s;itting all alone, on this &s;ame &s;eat, and lo&s;t in an agreeable mu&s;ing. I was ob&s;erving the &s;un &s;et, and took notice that I lo&s;t &s;ight of him, ex|actly

<P>Oh! if that be the ca&s;e, here are the &s;tars, uncle, that begin to appear; and I am glad they are able to give our globe a good character, for if we &s;hould be a little carele&s;s in our moti|ons, the earth is not, and perhaps the &s;tars will take us, her inhabitants, to be, like her, very &s;teady regular folks.</P>

<P>It is here, my dear Emily, that we &s;hould begin to e&s;tabli&s;h our&s;elves a good reputation, without troubling our heads with what the &s;tars may think of us. And after all, &s;uch a mi&s;conception would be of no &s;ervice to

<P>Without being more credu|lous than tho&s;e ladies, why &s;hould you be le&s;s in|dulgent? If the flattery of this fiction could e|ver turn their heads, it has at lea&s;t never offended them. It carries its own pardon with it, as it ari&s;es from the poet's wi&s;h to &s;ee it realized.</P>

<P>Yes, certainly, uncle.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa, and that fine large walnut tree that we pa&s;&s;ed ye&s;terday evening, when I felt &s;uch an appetite for &s;ome of the walnuts. I was glad to &s;ee it again, though at a di&s;tance, for it appeared to me, as I &s;tood here, to be ju&s;t on the edge of the horizon.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your per&s;pective is not quite exact; for you might &s;ee far behind it that large gothick ca&s;tle, that is falling to ruin; you know it is a good way farther off; when we had pa&s;&s;ed it in the chai&s;e, was it not a full quarter of an hour before we reached the walnut-tree?</P>

<P>Now I gue&s;s, by the time of our coming, that the ca&s;tle is about two miles and a quarter from this place, and the walnut-tree about half that di&s;tance, at mo&s;t.

May it not be the &s;ame, George, with re&s;pect to the &s;eemingly regular arch of the heavens, and tho&s;e &s;tars that appear to be fixed in the &s;ame concave &s;urface? and, in &s;hort, with re&s;pect to us who think our&s;elves to be in the centre of this beautiful &s;phere?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny it, papa; if my &s;ight deceives me at a &s;mall di&s;tance, it very well may, where the &s;pace is &s;o immen&s;e. But that we are not in the middle &s;pot under the heavens, I can hardly give up. I would have wagered, that
<PB N="81" REF="045437_0079_10202807DF869268">
there are not two inches more on one &s;ide than the other.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us try that. Before we &s;at down to dinner, you know, we went to &s;ee the clergyman of the pari&s;h.</P>

<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, he is a very good man! he gave me a fine pear.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>That mu&s;t prove him to be an hone&s;t man. However, we do not talk of his orchard now, but of his garret. You remem|ber how much he prai&s;ed the pro&s;pect that is to be &s;een from the window of it; you know, we went up; well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and his garret window is not higher than the level of this terrace.</P>

<P>What! is not there a wider pro&s;pect from it than from this &s;pot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>

<P>So, there is &s;omething to en|courage me; well then, let us go a little further. You know, I &s;uppo&s;e, as well as Emily, that the earth moves in an orbit round the &s;un. I will draw it here upon the ground. Do you &s;ee? it is a &s;ort of oval, called an ellip&s;e, as you have been told. There, it is fini&s;hed. You can &s;ee it pretty well by the light of the moon, which is ju&s;t ri&s;ing. I will put down my hat within the orbit for the &s;un.</P>

<P>Have I made you wait? There, John, put the torch in the place of this hat. I think, papa, that makes a better &s;un than yours; you would have caught cold in looking at the other. Pray put on your hat, papa, for fear of the dew.</P>

<P>It is acknowledged, that the diameter of the earth's orbit, is 200,000,000 miles. The earth, therefore, at one extremity of this diameter, &s;ees the oppo&s;ite &s;tar 200,000,000 miles nearer than at the other.</P>

<P>But if this immen&s;e orbit be no more than an imperceptible point, compared to the di&s;tance of the &s;tar, what will the globe of the earth be then, compared to this &s;ame di&s;tance, the earth being no more than a point, as it were, in the immen&s;e &s;pace of her own orbit?

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Cro&s;by.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well now, what mortifies me much more, is, that all the famous philo&s;ophers of antiquity, would place our incon&s;iderable planet in the centre of the univer&s;e, and no where el&s;e. I &s;ee, that in the fir&s;t age of wi&s;dom, men were &s;till but a compo&s;ition of pride and folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pythagoras had brought from Egypt and India, the founde&s;t notions of a&s;tro|nomy, which he extended no farther during his life-time, than the compa&s;s of the &s;chool that he had founded in Italy; his di&s;ciples, however, carried them into Greece, after his death. By this great man, the &s;un was placed in the centre of our &s;y&s;tem, the planets moving round him in this order, Mercury, Venus, the earth, with her moon, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. He did mi&s;|take, it is true, as to their di&s;tances and magni|tudes; but the geometry of his age, was not &s;ufficiently advanced, nor in&s;truments brought to their pre&s;ent perfection.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>How could he &s;ucceed among people who were taught, by their men of genius, that the earth was flat, like a table, and the hea|vens an arched vault of hard &s;olid matter, like
<PB N="87" REF="045437_0085_1020281A1A87B7B0">
the earth; or that the &s;un was a ma&s;s of fire, &s;omewhat larger than Peloponne&s;us; that comets were formed by the accidental concour&s;e of &s;e|veral wandering &s;tars; that &s;tars were only rocks or mountains carried up by the revolution of the ether, which had &s;et them on fire; or, in &s;hort, that the &s;tars were lighted up at night to be put out in the morning, while the &s;un, which they made a fiery cloud, was kindled in the morning, to go out at night; and that there were &s;everal &s;uns and moons to enlighten our different cli|mates? Now, if the &s;tar of day was, according to all the&s;e notions, le&s;s than the earth, could it be expected that &s;he would re&s;ign the centre of the univer&s;e to him?</P>
</SP>

<P>Ptolemy finding the&s;e opini|ons received in his time, and building on the fal|lacious evidence of the &s;en&s;es, ea&s;ily per&s;uaded him&s;elf and others, that the opinions of Pytha|goras were only vi&s;ionary, that the earth was the centre of all motion, both of the planets (the &s;un being reckoned among them) and of the fixed &s;tars, with his gla&s;s heavens, which he blew out at one whiff. This &s;y&s;tem held its ground for more than fourteen centuries, patched up every day with &s;ome additional ab&s;urdity, which its fa|vorers adopted, in order to defend them&s;elves a|gain&s;t the objections that pre&s;&s;ed harde&s;t upon them.</P>

<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I felt that pa&s;|&s;ion, in &s;ome degree, la&s;t year, when I went to &s;ee his &s;tatue at Cambridge. Roubilliac, a French &s;culptor, has repre&s;ented him in an erect attitude, looking at the &s;un, and &s;hewing him, with one hand, a pri&s;m, which he holds in the other to decompo&s;e his rays. While I was lifted up in thought, to the va&s;t height to which he has rai&s;ed human knowledge, I imagined Nature as &s;he formed him, to addre&s;s him thus. "Though man has &s;tudied my laws for &s;o many ages, he has &s;till mi&s;conceived them; it is time now to reveal them to him. Thou art born to publi&s;h them upon earth; go then, renew a&s;tronomy, en|large geometry, and lay the ba&s;is of natural phi|lo&s;ophy. I a&s;&s;ign thee the&s;e &s;ciences, at the &s;ame time, with the genius that attends thy birth. Thou &s;halt tell the extent of the univer&s;e, and
<PB N="91" REF="045437_0089_10202825CC7E49B8">
the &s;implicity of the order that governs it. Thou &s;halt weigh the ma&s;s of tho&s;e immen&s;e bodies which I have &s;cattered through it; thou &s;halt point out their form, determine their revoluti|ons, and mea&s;ure their di&s;tances; thou &s;halt re|duce to preci&s;e calculation, even the inequalities of their movements. In the mid&s;t of them, thou &s;halt fix the &s;un, and &s;halt &s;ay by what power he rules them, and how he di&s;tributes to them light and activity. For thy reward, I will place thee thy&s;elf, as a new luminary, in the mid&s;t of all the great men who are to follow thee. Whil&s;t thou give&s;t a rapid impul&s;e to their genius, thou &s;halt make it ince&s;&s;antly tend to|wards thine own; and they &s;hall move round thee with re&s;pect, in order to receive light from thee. As for tho&s;e who would depart from it, like rebellious comets, that to &s;hrink from the empire of the &s;un, lo&s;e them&s;elves for ages in the viewle&s;s depth of &s;pace, but which he con&s;tantly brings back to the foot of his throne, &s;o they, from the darkne&s;s of their errors, &s;hall be forced to return to thee, nor &s;hall they &s;hine in any part of their cour&s;e, even with tran&s;ient light, &s;ave when at your approach, they are enveloped in the &s;plendor of your rays."</P>

<HEAD>SECOND CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>An agreeable chearfulne&s;s reigned during the time of &s;upper. Mr. Glanville and his &s;i&s;ter were delighted with the readine&s;s of apprehen|&s;ion, and fondne&s;s for in&s;truction, which their children had di&s;covered. They &s;miled, to ob&s;erve the di&s;patch that Emily and George made of their &s;upper, who &s;poke not a word the whole time, &s;o eager were they to return to the terrace, and re&s;ume the &s;ubject of their conver&s;ation. Our little philo&s;ophers had already fini&s;hed their re|pa&s;t, and began to fret upon their &s;eats with im|patience, which Mrs. Cro&s;by, who ob&s;erved it, probably took a plea&s;ure to prolong. Be that as it may, Emily, in order to lo&s;e no time, began to joke upon George's romantic pride, in wi&s;h|ing to be vi&s;ible to the &s;tars. George bore this plea&s;antry with a good grace, until he &s;aw his father and aunt (whom he had been watching for &s;ome time) fini&s;h their &s;upper; then turning &s;hort to Emily, "cou&s;in," &s;aid he, loud enough to draw the general attention, "I was reading the other day a &s;tory which, I dare &s;ay, my papa knows, and your mamma too, but which, I dare &s;ay, you do not. I will tell it to you. Mahomet had once a mind to give his army a proof of the power which he exerci&s;ed over na|ture, and promi&s;ed to perform a very great miracle in their pre&s;ence. This was no le&s;s than to make a pretty high mountain move and come to him, from a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. One fine morning, therefore, he a&s;&s;embles all his &s;oldiers, who already gave their great prophet credit for
<PB N="93" REF="045437_0091_1020282D0CE05360">
the performance of &s;omething prodigious, and placing him&s;elf at their head, he orders the moun|tain to approach. The mountain turns a deaf ear to his word of command. Mahomet is &s;ur|prized. He calls it a &s;econd time, with a voice more terrible than at fir&s;t. The mountain, as you may imagine, did not &s;tir the more for this &s;ummons. How is this! cried the impo&s;tor, with an air of in&s;piration, the mountain will not walk to us) Well then, my friends, let us walk to the mountain.&mdash;I have no more ill-nature in me, than Mahomet; if the &s;tars do not &s;ee us, why then, cou&s;in, let us go &s;ee the &s;tars.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words he ro&s;e bri&s;kly from table, and bounced towards the door, leaving Emily a good deal &s;urprized at this conclu&s;ion. Mr. Glan|ville and Mrs. Cro&s;by &s;miled at his ready turn, and followed him into the garden.</P>
<P>It was a mo&s;t beautiful clear night; not a cloud intercepted the &s;ight of the &s;ky. The moon which had now begun to appear above the horizon, &s;uffered tho&s;e &s;tars which &s;he had ju&s;t before ob&s;cured, to re&s;ume their lu&s;tre, as &s;he gradually withdrew from them. The children had often admired the grandeur of this &s;ight, but now, when their curio&s;ity upon the &s;ubject was going to be &s;atisfied, they beheld it with additio|nal rapture. The bright &s;tar of Sirius was the fir&s;t that attracted George's notice.

it is in fact, no larger nor brighter than the re&s;t, but then it is nearer the earth. If it were brought to the di&s;tance of the &s;un, it would un|doubtedly appear at large as he does.

<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not deny that all the at|tempts of a&s;tronomers to mea&s;ure the magnitudes of &s;tars, and by means of them their di&s;tances, have been ineffectual. But this very impo&s;&s;ibi|lity is &s;ufficient to prove, at lea&s;t, that the di&s;tance is prodigious; for the magnitudes of the planets have been determined with &s;ufficient accuracy, even the mo&s;t di&s;tant ones, and among the re&s;t, this hand&s;ome planet, Jupiter.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surprizingly well explained: and thus it is, that Jupiter's di&s;k does not appear magnified; and &s;mall as his di&s;tance &s;hews him, a&s;tronomers have in&s;truments of &s;ufficient pre|ci&s;ion to mea&s;ure him. But the &s;tars, with that dazzling radiance that &s;urrounds them.&mdash;</P>

<P>It is exactly the effect which a tele&s;cope produces, by uniting and concentra|ting all their rays into a point.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>By a very ingenious method. The magnitude and di&s;tance of the &s;un is known from the &s;ure&s;t rea&s;oning.

Mo&s;t a&s;tronomers even judge this di&s;tance to be more con&s;iderable, becau&s;e it is to be doubted, whether the be&s;t tele&s;cope can totally dive&s;t a &s;tar of its &s;uperfluous light, and make it pre&s;erve, to our view, the &s;ize which it &s;hould, at that di&s;|tance.</P>

<P>Very well, my boy, your ob|&s;ervation is quite ju&s;t. It has been demon&s;trated, that the light of a &s;tar might be dimini&s;hed ma|ny millions of times, by removing it farther from our &s;ight, and yet it &s;hould &s;till appear no fainter than a piece of white paper by moonlight.</P>

<P>The motion of the &s;un round its axis would alone be &s;ufficient to render i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> probable.

All the planets, at the &s;ame time that they go round him, move thus, in order to receive his warmth &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively in all their parts. Now, &s;ince he is endowed with this &s;ame movement, may we not &s;uppo&s;e him to have the other al&s;o, and to be carried round a central power, &s;till &s;uperior to him&s;elf?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, to &s;atisfy you: the motion of three of the large&s;t &s;tars, Sirius, Arc|turus and Aldebaran, is acknowledged; it is well known that Arcturus moves, every year, two hundred and &s;eventy millions of miles to|wards the &s;outh: &s;o prodigious is the di&s;tance even of tho&s;e &s;tars which are neare&s;t to the earth, that their change of place is &s;carcely perceptible after &s;everal years: judge if other &s;tars, infinitely farther di&s;tant, may not have a movement full as

<P>Since the moving of tho&s;e great &s;tars is &s;o certain, I have nothing to offer again&s;t your conjecture: nay, I can very well imagine, according to your idea, that the &s;malle&s;t may move, without vi&s;ibly changing place, till after a long period of time, an account of their incon|ceivable di&s;tance: but is it not &s;ufficient, in order to &s;atisfy you of the immen&s;ity of the univer&s;e, that certain &s;tars move in an orbit, of who&s;e ex|tent, even the imagination cannot form to it&s;elf an idea?

<P>I &s;hould otherwi&s;e impeach Nature.

<P>In the mid&s;t of all the&s;e &s;uns, ab&s;olutely immoveable, let us &s;uppo&s;e but one in motion; like a conqueror that marches through his own dominions in good order, while he advances to foreign deva&s;tation, &s;o he moves peaceably within the bounds of his own empire; but when once he reaches the frontiers of the

<P>Oh!

<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever motion you allow him, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be round a &s;uperior bo|dy, the centre of his orbit, as he is the centre of the orbits of all the bodies that are &s;ubject to his &s;way. This is a law which Nature invariably follows in the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e. Comets, who&s;e motions, according to our ideas, are the mo&s;t irregular, are &s;ubject to it in their greate&s;t excentricities; while they run almo&s;t in a &s;traight line to the extremity of their ellip&s;e, they are continually de&s;cribing their ap|pointed orbit round the &s;un.</P>
</SP>

<P>What then! for every &s;un, &s;hould a &s;uperior body be created round which he mu&s;t move?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nature has more re&s;ources.

This grada|tion of &s;y&s;tems of &s;uperior bodies continually in|crea&s;ing in bulk, and decrea&s;ing in number, may terminate in the central body of the whole uni|ver&s;e, on which, no doubt, repo&s;es the throne of the Supreme Being, who, with one look, beholds the whole of his admirable work.</P>

the march of univer&s;al nature. What a &s;pecta|cle opens to your eyes! Tho&s;e &s;tars, which to us here below, appear but immoveable lights, you behold in all their &s;plendor, like &s;uns moving in &s;ilence, with all their planetary train, round more powerful &s;uns, who carry them al&s;o round &s;uns &s;till more glorious.

This, combined with the impul&s;e which they received on coming from his creative hand, and regulated by the propor|tion of magnitudes and di&s;tances, is the univer&s;al agent of nature. This tends to re-unite what the projectile motion would &s;eparate. The&s;e two forces perpetually acting, balance each other and pre&s;erve among the worlds, that order which was e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ince the creation. Each body, nay, each &s;y&s;tem, attracts all the re&s;t, as it is at|tracted by them. A general reciprocity of at|traction unites them, while it keeps them &s;epa|rate, and acts as a prop to their orbits, without breaking in upon them. The &s;uns which en|lighten them, receive their reflected rays, that not an atom of light be di&s;&s;ipated in vain through the immen&s;ity of &s;pace.

<HEAD>SCENE Fairfax's tent before the walls of Colche&s;ter.</HEAD>
<P>THE civil war in England under Charles I. being, as it were, re-kindled, after a &s;hort ce&s;&s;ation, the parliament, by re&s;olving to pre&s;ent no more addre&s;&s;es to that unfortunate prince, then a pri&s;oner in the I&s;le of Wight, filled the hearts of all hone&s;t men with indignation. Scot|land, Wales, &s;ome towns in the North, part of the county of Surry, and even &s;eventeen men of war in the parliament's pay, declared for the king. There were &s;ome ri&s;ings al&s;o in his favour in the counties of E&s;&s;ex and Kent, which were &s;upported by the zeal of the Earl of Surry, Lord Capel, Sir Charles Lucas, and Sir George Li&s;le. Again&s;t the&s;e Sir Thomas Fairfax was &s;ent with a pretty numerous army. That able
<PB N="131" REF="045437_0129_1020288AB6681DA8">
General found no difficulty in defeating a few troops newly rai&s;ed, and ill di&s;ciplined. He gained a complete victory over them at Maid|&s;tone in Kent; and pur&s;uing their &s;cattered re|mains, he obliged both them and the royali&s;ts in E&s;&s;ex to &s;hut them&s;elves up in the town of Col|che&s;ter, which he ha&s;tened immediately to inve&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;iege of Colche&s;ter is one of the mo&s;t re|markable events of that unfortunate period, on account of the ob&s;tinate defence made by the be|&s;ieged. It la&s;ted from the 18th of June, to the end of Augu&s;t, 1648. The walls and fortifica|tions of the town, &s;aid to have been built by the Romans, and remarkable for that &s;trength and &s;olidity which their works u&s;ually di&s;play, &s;till exhibit dreadful marks of the fury of the &s;iege. The greate&s;t part of the churches in particular were half demoli&s;hed by the batteries of the par|liament army; but the be&s;ieged, notwith&s;tanding the violent a&s;&s;aults of their adver&s;aries, notwith|&s;tanding the extremities to which they were re|duced for want of provi&s;ion, in&s;omuch that they had nothing left for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, but the hor&s;es of the garri&s;on, continued to make bri&s;k &s;allies, and defied all the force of the be&s;iegers, in the un|certain expectation of relief from &s;ome quarter or other.</P>
<P>At this period commences the action of the following drama, in which the principal object is, to delineate in its proper &s;tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gth, the re&s;olute and generous character of Lord Capel, which was invariably di&s;played in every circum&s;tance of his life and death. Such a character, it is
<PB N="132" REF="045437_0130_1020288C46239820">
pre&s;umed, will not be found unintere&s;ting to the mind of a young reader; and in order to re|pre&s;ent it to the fulle&s;t advantage, at the end of the drama, are &s;ubjoined &s;ome intere&s;ting par|ticulars concerning the death of that virtuous nobleman.</P>
<P>It remains, however, to be ob&s;erved, that the fact upon which the drama principally turns, is by no means advanced as authentic. Neither Lord Clarendon, or any other writer of that age, takes the lea&s;t notice of it. Nor has Hume, or &s;uch modern hi&s;torians, as from their aver&s;ion to the republican party, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed would not let &s;lip &s;uch an incident, made any mention of the circum&s;tance. It depends, there|fore, entirely upon the credit of Mon&s;ieur Ra|guenet, who in his life of Cromwell relates it at large, with many particulars, which at lea&s;t give it the appearance of probability.</P>

<HEAD>SEQUEL.</HEAD>
<P>Cromwell, who was &s;ent by General Fairfax to oppo&s;e the Duke of Hamilton and Sir Mar|maduke Langdale, having defeated tho&s;e two ge|nerals &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and taken the duke pri&s;oner, and the Earl of Holland having al&s;o been defeat|ed, and made pri&s;oner, by another detachment of the parliament-army; the inhabitants of Col|che&s;ter, who only held out, in hopes of being re|lieved, &s;aw them&s;elves, at length, reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of capitulating: they deputed per&s;ons to Fairfax, to treat of the &s;urrender of the town upon honorable terms; but he, provoked at the ob&s;tinacy of their defence, offered them no other than to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. Upon receiving this an&s;wer, the be&s;ieged &s;pent two days more in con&s;ultation: the fir&s;t re&s;olution taken by the of|ficers, was, to force their way through the ene|my's camp, &s;word in hand; but the few hor&s;es, which their hunger had &s;pared, were found too weak for this attempt: on the other hand, the &s;oldiers, exhau&s;ted with fatigue, were unable to &s;u&s;tain another a&s;&s;ault; &s;o that they were obliged, at length, to open the gates to Fairfax, and to &s;ubmit to the conditions that he &s;hould think proper to impo&s;e on them.</P>
<P>He &s;uffered the &s;oldiers to depart, but without arms or baggage; but the officers he ordered to be confined in the town-hall, and a li&s;t of their names to be &s;ent to him. Ireton, whom Crom|well,
<PB N="159" REF="045437_0157_102028DC28827FA8">
in his ab&s;ence, had left as a &s;py upon the un&s;u&s;pecting general, cho&s;e out of this lift &s;uch as were more particularly his enemies, in order that they might be put to death. Sir Charles Lucas, therefore, Sir G. Li&s;le, and Sir Barnard Ga&s;coyne, were brought before the council of war, where Fairfax declared to them, that for a puni&s;hment of their ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, and a warning example to all others who &s;hould be in|clined to imitate it, they were &s;entenced to die, that very day, at the foot of the ca&s;tle-walls.</P>
<P>When this &s;entence was communicated to the other pri&s;oners, Lord Capel prevailed upon an officer of the guard which was over them, to de|liver to the council of war a letter &s;igned by the principal officers, intreating them to revoke their cruel &s;entence, or el&s;e to extend it to all the pri|&s;oners, who blu&s;hed to &s;ee them&s;elves excepted from it. This generous reque&s;t had no other ef|fect, than to ha&s;ten the execution of their unfor|tunate companions.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Lucas, who was the fir&s;t officer &s;hot, gave the &s;ignal to his murderers to fire, with as much coolne&s;s as he would have delivered the word of command to his own men. Li&s;le, &s;ee|ing him fall, ran to him, and embraced his dead body, and then ri&s;ing, looked with a &s;tern air upon the &s;oldiers by whom he was to be &s;hot, and ordered them to come nearer. One of them an&s;wered him, that they were near enough, and that they &s;hould not mi&s;s him. My friends, re|plied he, &s;miling, I have been nearer to you, and yet you have mi&s;&s;ed me.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="045437_0158_101FFAC99453DB80">
Sir B. Ga&s;coyne, or Gua&s;coni, a Florentine gentleman, was &s;pared by the council of war, under the apprehen&s;ion left the Grand Duke of Tu&s;cany, informed of &s;uch a violation of the laws of war, &s;hould retort upon the Engli&s;h who might be found in his dominions.</P>
<P>After the execution of Li&s;le and Lucas, Ge|neral Fairfax, accompanied by G. Ireton, went to the town-hall to &s;ee the pri&s;oners. In ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Earl of Norwich and Lord Capel, he endeavored, with a &s;oothing ci|vility, to excu&s;e the rigour which military ju&s;tice had exacted from him. But Lord Capel, who looked upon Ireton as the &s;ole in&s;tigator of this barbarity, loaded him with the bittere&s;t reproaches, which, however, the latter very &s;oon found an opportunity of revenging.</P>
<P>The parliament having ordered the Lords Norwich and Capel to be confined in Wind&s;or Ca&s;tle, they found the Duke of Hamilton there before them, with whom they had the melancho|ly &s;atisfaction of deploring their misfortunes in common. They were &s;oon, however, removed to the Tower, there to await the de&s;tiny which parliament &s;hould think proper to allot to them.</P>
<P>About a month after King Charles I. was be|headed, another high court of ju&s;tice was formed for the trial of the&s;e three noblemen, as al&s;o of the Earl of Holland and Sir John Owen, who had taken an active part in Wales, in favor of the king, and killed, with his own hand, a &s;heriff of the oppo&s;ite party.</P>
<P>Lord Capel appeared with the greate&s;t firmne&s;s and dignity in the pre&s;ence of his judges, and re|fu&s;ed
<PB N="161" REF="045437_0159_102028DF20272F98">
to acknowledge their authority; alledging, that as a &s;oldier and a pri&s;oner of war, he was not amenable to the civil law. Upon which Brad&s;haw, who was pre&s;ident of the court, an|&s;wered him with unfeeling in&s;olence, by alluding to their form of proceeding again&s;t the king, "that they had tried a much better man than his lord&s;hip." After &s;ome debates, in which Ireton broke out with all the violence and fury of his natural di&s;po&s;ition, &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed upon Lord Capel and the other pri&s;oners. They were all condemned to lo&s;e their heads; upon which it is &s;aid, that Sir John Owen made the judges a low bow, and thanked them for the high honor which they conferred on him, in or|dering him, who was but a poor Welch gentle|man, to lo&s;e his head in company with noblemen of &s;o con&s;iderable rank; adding, that his greate&s;t fear had been, le&s;t the common hangman &s;hould have terminated his de&s;tiny. The pri&s;oners were allowed but three days to &s;et their affairs in order, and to prepare for death.</P>
<P>Lady Capel employed this &s;hort &s;pace in draw|ing up a petition to be laid before parliament; when read, it was very &s;trongly &s;upported by &s;e|veral members, who &s;poke in the highe&s;t terms of Lord Capel's many and eminent virtues. E|ven Cromwell prai&s;ed his lord&s;hip &s;o highly, and profe&s;&s;ed &s;o much re&s;pect and friend&s;hip for him, that every one expected him to be inclined in his favor, when he added, in a hypocritical canting tone, that his zeal for the public cau&s;e got the better of all his private affections; that he knew Lord Capel to be the la&s;t man in England who
<PB N="162" REF="045437_0160_102028E0B5148810">
would abandon the royal party; that his inflex|ibility of principle, his experience and valor, the number and attachment of his friends, made him the mo&s;t formidable enemy that parliament had; that as long as he lived, let him be reduced to what&s;oever condition he might, they would find him always a thorn in their &s;ides; and he con|cluded with prote&s;ting, that his con&s;cience, and the intere&s;ts of the commonwealth, impo&s;ed it on him as a duty to give his vote again&s;t the pe|tition.</P>
<P>The implacable Ireton vented his hatred and animo&s;ity with le&s;s di&s;gui&s;e: he vehemently main|tained, in the hou&s;e of commons, the &s;entence which he had procured to be pa&s;&s;ed in the high court of ju&s;tice. Though there was not a &s;ingle per&s;on who knew Lord Capel's character, but entertained the highe&s;t e&s;teem and veneration for him, and very few who had any &s;ubject of per|&s;onal quarrel again&s;t him, yet Cromwell and Ire|ton thus appearing his declared enemies, the ju&s;|tice due to his virtues, and the compa&s;&s;ion which his misfortunes in&s;pired, were put to &s;ilence by the terror of tho&s;e two names, and his fate was given up to their revenge.</P>
<P>Of the number condemned, the Earl of Nor|wich and Sir John Owen received a pardon. The former having pre&s;ented a petition to par|liament, the hou&s;e divided upon it, and the num|bers on both &s;ides were found to be equal; the Speaker, therefore, who&s;e vote was to determine the earl's de&s;tiny, having formerly been under o|bligations to him, was induced, from a motive of gratitude, to &s;ave his life.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="045437_0161_102028E6C5033BD0">
Sir John Owen was &s;o indifferent about his, that he had not &s;o much as thought of petition|ing. Ireton whim&s;ically made this very negli|gence a plea in his favor, when he moved the hou&s;e to &s;pare his life. He thought, perhaps, by this exception, to offer a fre&s;h in&s;ult to the three noblemen, and to make their death more grat|ing, by &s;hewing them a private per&s;on &s;aved from the rigour of his &s;entence, without ever pe|titioning, while their applications were &s;o con|temptuou&s;ly rejected.</P>
<P>A &s;caffold was therefore erected under the windows of the parliament hou&s;e. After the Duke of Hamilton and the Earl of Holland had &s;uffered, Lord Capel was called: he walked down We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall with a &s;erene counte|nance and a firm &s;tep, &s;aluting his acquaintances with dignity. Dr. Morley, his friend, who had not quitted him, from the moment of his con|demnation, was &s;olicitous to accompany him now, that he might receive his la&s;t commands: but he was &s;topped by the &s;oldiers, at the foot of the &s;caffold. My lord took leave of him, em|braced him affectionately, thanked him for all his attentions, and would not &s;uffer him to go any further, le&s;t he &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the bru|tality of the guards. Advancing then towards the edge of the &s;caffold, he looked round him with a placid countenance, and a&s;ked whether the other lords had &s;poken to the people unco|vered, and being an&s;wered in the affirmative, he gave his hat to one of the attendants to hold; then, with a clear bold voice, he declared that he came to lo&s;e his life for an action which he could
<PB N="164" REF="045437_0162_102028E9B111D038">
never repent of; that having been brought up in principles of attachment to the con&s;titution of his country, loyalty to his &s;overeign, and fidelity to his religion, he had never violated any of the&s;e principles; that he was now condemned to die, contrary to all the laws of the realm, and that, neverthele&s;s, he &s;ubmitted to this unju&s;t &s;entence.</P>
<P>He then enlarged upon the prai&s;es of that king whom they had recently murdered, and be|&s;ought heaven not to avenge this crime on the deluded nation. He concluded, with earne&s;tly exhorting them to acknowledge the &s;on of Charles as their rightful &s;overeign. La&s;tly, after a &s;hort and fervent prayer, he &s;tretched his neck to the fatal blow, which deprived England of the mo&s;t virtuous citizen that &s;he had left her.</P>

<HEAD>THE LAWSUIT.</HEAD>
<P>FARMER BLUNT, when he died, left two &s;ons, the one named Roger, the other Hum|phrey. His death put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of farms &s;ufficiently advantageous to afford them a decent competency. Very little was wanting to their happine&s;s. Alas! then, why could they not live in that harmony and good under&s;tand|&s;tanding which Nature de&s;igned &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t be|tween brothers, when &s;he formed them of the &s;ame blood?</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="045437_0163_102028EB3AD0FDD8">
Among the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions left by their father, was a very fine orchard, which he had cultivated in his life time with particular care. As it bore, mo&s;t years, a prodigious quantity of apples, re|markable for making the be&s;t cyder, it appeared to both the brothers a very de&s;irable lot; but, unfortunately, in the partition of their father's lands made by his will, the property of this was left undetermined.</P>
<P>Each, therefore, claimed the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in &s;upporting that claim. They no longer &s;poke to each other in amicable terms; on the contrary, their mutual ob&s;tinacy degenerated on both &s;ides into a confirmed ha|tred. You are not an hone&s;t man, &s;aid Roger, for claiming what is my property, and you do not de&s;erve to be ma&s;ter of &s;o good a piece of ground. Humphrey, in a rage, would an&s;wer, it well becomes you to talk &s;o, lazy fellow as you are: Have you not always made my father un|happy, by your drunkenne&s;s? What would be|come of tho&s;e trees, in your idle hands? In two or three years the orchard would not be worth &s;ixpence.</P>
<P>The curate of the village being informed of their quarrel, went to them, and expo&s;tulated with them in the mo&s;t friendly manner. What are you doing, my friends? &s;aid he; wherefore are you weary of living happily together? Shall this orchard be the means of di&s;uniting you? Why not rather join your indu&s;try to improve it, and afterwards divide the produce?</P>

I do not intend any &s;uch thing, &s;aid one, I will have it all to my&s;elf. We &s;hall &s;ee that, re|plied the other, I think <HI>I</HI> &s;hall have it.</P>
<P>Well, then, &s;aid the clergyman, let the mo&s;t rea&s;onable of you re&s;ign his claim, upon receiv|ing a &s;uitable con&s;ideration from the other.</P>
<P>With all my heart, cried they, both at once, let my brother give it up to me. I have mo&s;t right to it, &s;aid the elde&s;t.

<P>Since you are both &s;o ob&s;tinate, &s;aid the cu|rate, and cannot agree together, will you leave the deci&s;ion of the matter to fortune, and di&s;po&s;e of it by lot? No, I will ri&s;k nothing, &s;aid Hodge. Nor I, neither, &s;aid Numps.

<P>I &s;ee, &s;aid the worthy clergyman, nothing can overcome your ob&s;tinacy: you will &s;oon find the mi&s;erable effects of mutual hatred in hearts, which were intended by nature to be dear to each other.</P>
<P>The brothers did not trouble them&s;elves about this prophecy, but each of them went to the man of law whom he thought mo&s;t capable of &s;etting off his claim to advantage. Thus began a law&s;uit, which &s;eemed ea&s;y enough to be deci|ded, but was kept on foot, neverthele&s;s, for five whole years; the coun&s;el on both &s;ides being veterans in the bu&s;ine&s;s. If one party put in a

<HI>plea,</HI> the other intercepted it with a <HI>demurrer.</HI> It was, every term, fre&s;h <HI>writs, declarations,</HI> and <HI>re|joinders.</HI> The orchard all this while, we may &s;uppo&s;e, was not &s;o well cultivated as in the time of hone&s;t Farmer Blunt: tho&s;e fine apple-trees were neglected, and did not produce near their u&s;ual quantity. Hor&s;es and pigs were &s;uffered to break in and damage them; Humphrey, who had the orchard in his hands, being too much taken up with his law&s;uit to attend to the culture of it.</P>
<P>They were both married to very amiable wo|men, and had many children, in whom they would have been perfectly happy, had their minds been more at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Each of their wives would &s;ometimes acco&s;t them thus: My dear hu&s;band, why are you &s;o unea&s;y? We have every thing that our hearts can wi&s;h; Have we not? You are in very good health, &s;o am I. Our little family goes on charmingly; then we have an excellent farm; and, you know, it is your own fault if you do not make money by it. Why will you not chu&s;e to be happy? Each of them would mutter be|tween his teeth, and an&s;wer, How can I be hap|py, while I have &s;uch a good-for-nothing bro|ther? His inju&s;tice and ob&s;tinacy are poi&s;on to my happine&s;s.</P>
<P>When, at their return from the field, they &s;aw their children running joyfully towards them, they would cry out to them, before they came near, What do you want with me? Get away. I am not in a humour, now, to mind your tricks; I am too angry: and if the poor children &s;trove
<PB N="168" REF="045437_0166_102028F5D1AC79A0">
to &s;often them, by their innocent fondne&s;s, they would pu&s;h them away har&s;hly, and &s;ometimes give them very violent blows.</P>
<P>At table, nothing could plea&s;e them, becau&s;e their hearts were filled with gall; and, in bed, it was out of their power to &s;leep, becau&s;e they were eternally thinking how to hurt each other.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may &s;uppo&s;e that I have now told the wor&s;t. Alas! no. From ill-will they were carried to &s;lander and calumny: each &s;trove how to blacken the character of his brother the mo&s;t. If Numps happened to be in company with o|ther farmers, he would &s;trive to per&s;uade them that Hodge was a very bad man, who labored to ruin him fir&s;t, and would then go to law with every man in the pari&s;h. And as Hodge, for his part, was not backward in &s;aying much the &s;ame of Humphrey, the end of it was, that people be|lieved them both: &s;o that, in &s;hort, they were &s;hunned by every body, as dangerous per&s;ons; and there was not one of their neighbours who did not wi&s;h to &s;ee the village fairly rid of them.</P>
<P>After five years of jarring and brawling at law, judgment was given; and he who gained the cau&s;e, &s;aw him&s;elf obliged, very &s;oon, to &s;ell not only the orchard, but the greater part of his farms, to pay the expen&s;es of the &s;uit.</P>
<P>I leave you to gue&s;s how the lo&s;er came off. In fact, the confu&s;ion of them both may more ea&s;ily be imagined than de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid Numps, we have both of us de&s;er|ved this. It was in our own power to have a|voided it. We might &s;till have had our farms and our money. In&s;tead of all the trouble that
<PB N="169" REF="045437_0167_102028F75B29A8B8">
we have each cau&s;ed the other, we &s;hould have made one another, as well as our own families, happy, and have gained the friend&s;hip and e&s;teem of our neighbors.</P>
<P>See, &s;aid Hodge, all this we have lo&s;t by our folly. Ah! if things were to begin again!</P>
<P>Marry, &s;aid Numps, let us be wi&s;er for the fu|ture. Come, brother, here is my hand, I will never be your enemy as long as I live.</P>
<P>Nor I your's, replied Hodge, taking his hand. So &s;aying, they both &s;hed tears, and the bitter|ne&s;s of hatred departed from their hearts.</P>
<P>They very &s;oon found them&s;elves much ea&s;ier in living upon friendly terms with each other; but the ill effects of their former perver&s;ene&s;s they were de&s;tined to feel for a long time. They &s;aw their orchard, which had been the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their family for &s;ome generations, turn to good account in the hands of &s;trangers, while the little that remained to them of their own farms took &s;ome time to recover from the ill-manage|ment of five years. Be&s;ides, deri&s;ion was &s;wift to pur&s;ue them in the village, while confidence and amity returned to them with a &s;low pace. The alacrity of their advocates, in receiving the fee, had thinned their pur&s;es, while fatigue, fret|ting, and large draughts of unwhole&s;ome law, impaired their health. Even their children did not now &s;alute them with the free uncon&s;trained affection which appears in the children of the virtuous and the benevolent. And their wives&mdash;Alas! it was &s;ome time before they could view their hu&s;bands with the tenderne&s;s of former years.</P>

<HEAD>LOST TIME RECOVERED.</HEAD>
<P>LORENZO'S parents were &s;o much engaged in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s, that they found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uperintend his education them|&s;elves. They had heard of a remarkably good &s;chool, where a number of young per&s;ons had been bred, who were di&s;tingui&s;hed for their im|provement in learning, and for the principles of honour which they had imbibed. Though it was upwards of a hundred miles from his hou&s;e, yet Lorenzo's father &s;ent him thither, recom|mending him, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, to the ma&s;ter. This gentleman, who regarded each of his pupils as his own &s;on, &s;pared no pains to correct his faults, to encourage him to &s;tudy, and to implant &s;entiments of honour and genero&s;ity in his young brea&s;t. The per&s;ons al&s;o, whom he had cho&s;en to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the&s;e labours, ex|erted their utmo&s;t to promote the &s;ame laudable purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Yet the&s;e endeavours, &s;o affectionately under|taken in his favour, were not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as might naturally be hoped: Lorenzo was of a re&s;t|le&s;s, incon&s;tant di&s;po&s;ition, and would forget the &s;en&s;ible advice which was given him, even at the very moment that he received it. In the hours alotted to &s;tudy, he &s;uffered his thoughts to wander in &s;uch a manner, as not to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;malle&s;t attention for the le&s;&s;ons of his ma&s;ters.
<PB N="171" REF="045437_0169_102028FD365A4E80">
All his occupations were &s;acrificed to the mo&s;t frivolous amu&s;ements; and he &s;hewed the &s;ame negligence in the care of his per&s;on and his books. His clothes were always in di&s;order; and, not|with&s;tanding his agreeable face and figure, one could not approach him, without feeling a certain di&s;ta&s;te ari&s;e, on &s;eeing &s;o much &s;lovenline&s;s.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to conceive how prejudicial this in|attention was to his advancement in learning. All his cla&s;s-fellows left him far behind. There was not one, even to the &s;malle&s;t, who came to the &s;chool long after him, who did not look upon him with contempt, as they were, every day, out&s;tripping him. Whenever any &s;trangers of condition vi&s;ited the hou&s;e, he was always &s;ent out of the way, left his &s;habbine&s;s and wild ap|pearance &s;hould di&s;grace his companions. He never appeared in the public yearly examinations that were held in the &s;chool: his ignorance would have been con&s;idered as a reproach to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment.</P>
<P>All the&s;e humiliating circum&s;tances made no impre&s;&s;ion on him: &s;till he continued in the &s;ame levity, the &s;ame di&s;&s;ipation, the &s;ame negligence. His teachers beheld him with a &s;ort of inward regret; and their zeal for his improvement grew, every day, cooler and cooler. They would often &s;ay to each other, Poor Lorenzo! how unhappy he will make him&s;elf! What will his parents &s;ay, when they &s;ee him return home &s;o full of ill habits, and &s;o deficient in learning?</P>
<P>Two whole years had thus &s;lipped away, with|out the lea&s;t profit to his education, when, at

</LETTER>
<P>Lorenzo's giddine&s;s had not &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the feelings of nature in him; and this letter awaken|ed them effectually. He bur&s;t into tears, wrung his hands, and, in a voice, broken with &s;obs, he cries, Ah! my father, my father; have I then lo&s;t you for ever! Taking the portrait, he pre&s;&s;es it to his heart and his lips, and apo&s;trophizes it
<PB N="173" REF="045437_0171_102029031D0B7878">
with the&s;e words: O dear author of my being, you have expended &s;o much for my in&s;truction, and I have not profited from it! You were &s;o worthy a man, and I&mdash;No, I do not de&s;erve to be called your &s;on.</P>
<P>He &s;pent the whole day in the&s;e bitter reflec|tions. At night he went to bed, but in vain he turned him&s;elf to and fro: &s;leep vi&s;ited him not. His imagination repre&s;ented before his eyes, the form of his father, who, in an angry and terrible voice, thus rebuked him: unworthy boy, I have &s;acrificed my repo&s;e and my life, to make you happy, and you bring di&s;honour on my name, by your mi&s;conduct. His thoughts would then turn on his mother, and on the di&s;tre&s;s that he mu&s;t occa&s;ion to her, in&s;tead of the con|&s;olation which &s;he expected to receive from his return. What will be her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid he, when I &s;hall appear before her, and have none but the mo&s;t mortifying te&s;timonies of my inattention to &s;hew her, from my in&s;tructors! In&s;tead of having cau&s;e to be proud of the education that &s;he has given me, I &s;hall force her to blu&s;h: &s;he will wi&s;h to love me, and I &s;hall de&s;erve but her hatred. O my dear parent! I &s;hall, perhaps, be the cau&s;e of her death. Oh, that I had pro|fited better by the in&s;tructions that have been lavi&s;hed upon me! Oh that I could recover the precious time that I have lo&s;t!</P>
<P>Thus did he torment him&s;elf the whole night, and bathe his bed with his tears. As &s;oon as it was light, he ro&s;e in ha&s;te, intending to begin an immediate and per&s;evering application to his &s;tudies; but meeting the head ma&s;ter, as he de|&s;cended
<PB N="174" REF="045437_0172_1020290667CA5B08">
to the &s;chool, he fell on his knees before him, and, O Sir, &s;aid he, you &s;ee here the mo&s;t unfortunate child upon earth. I have not at|tended to your words. I have learned nothing of what I &s;hould now know perfectly. Have com|pa&s;&s;ion on me; I would not wi&s;h to make my mother die of grief.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter was &s;en&s;ibly touched with this ad|dre&s;s: he rai&s;ed Lorenzo, and embraced him. My dear child, &s;aid he, &s;ince you &s;ee your fault, you may &s;till repair it. You perceive how dread|fully mortifying it is to have cau&s;e for &s;elf-reproach. Before you had a clear &s;en&s;e of your folly, you were barely blameable; but a con|tinuance of it would be criminal in you now. Two whole years you have entirely lo&s;t: you have but another for the fini&s;hing of your &s;tudies. Judge how you mu&s;t exert your&s;elf. However, be not di&s;couraged: there is nothing that cannot be accompli&s;hed with a&s;&s;iduity and per&s;everance. Begin, this very moment: it &s;hall not be the fault of my zeal, if you are not very &s;oon as well &s;atisfied with your&s;elf as you now have rea&s;on to be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Lorenzo could thank him no otherwi&s;e, than by taking his hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it to his lips. He than ran immediately to his form, and began to &s;tudy his le&s;&s;on, and continued to do the &s;ame every day following. His ma&s;ters, a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch per&s;evering diligence, &s;at immediately about cultivating his natural parts, with more care and attention than they had ever u&s;ed be|fore. His companions, who had conceived a mean opinion of him, were &s;oon obliged to
<PB N="175" REF="045437_0173_1020290ADBB4DD70">
change it, for e&s;teem. Encouraged by all the&s;e fortunate circum&s;tances, Lorenzo every day re|doubled his ardour and vigilance. He was no longer that giddy child who neglected every duty, to indulge him&s;elf in &s;illy, trifling amu&s;ements. Order and cleanline&s;s &s;ucceeded to his former &s;lovenly manner; and his teachers were now obliged to force him away from his &s;tudies, in order to make him enjoy &s;ome relaxation. He would, &s;ometimes, indeed, find him&s;elf in&s;en&s;ibly relap&s;ing towards his old habits, but he needed only to ca&s;t an eye upon his father's picture, to &s;trengthen him afre&s;h in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">dable re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The year which his mother had allowed him for the fini&s;hing of his &s;tudies, was drawing near a period: it &s;eemed to glide away very rapidly, as he filled up every moment of his time, and therefore found it hardly &s;ufficient for the &s;ub|jects of his application.</P>
<P>At length the hour of departure arrived. The change wrought in his character, had attached his companions to him &s;o affectionately, that the thoughts of parting with him gave them extreme concern. His ma&s;ters were grieved to &s;ee a youth depart, who now began to do credit to their in&s;tructions; and he was grieved no le&s;s at leaving his ma&s;ters, who&s;e prudent advice had &s;o well &s;upported him in his re&s;olution: the head ma&s;ter, in particular, who began to felicitate him|&s;elf on Lorenzo's progre&s;s, as his own proper work, was incon&s;olable; and his concern ap|peared very &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed, in a letter which he wrote to Lorenzo's mother, rendering her the
<PB N="176" REF="045437_0174_1020290C644E3C38">
mo&s;t advantageous account po&s;&s;ible, of her &s;on's behaviour.</P>
<P>During the whole journey, Lorenzo's emo|tions of hope, joy, and expectation, kept him <HI>tremblingly alive.</HI> His heart throbbed with the idea of re-vi&s;iting the &s;cenes of his infancy; nor did he now dread &s;o much to &s;hew him&s;elf be|fore his mother, becau&s;e he was con&s;cious, that for a twelvemonth pa&s;t, he had neglected nothing that could tend to his improvement. Yet he could not help &s;aying to him&s;elf, now and then, Fool that I was! Could I not have done the &s;ame thing three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ears ago? I &s;hould be, at this day, much farther advanced in learning. How many things, of which I am now ignorant, might I not have learned in that interval! Alas, I might have &s;pared my&s;elf many &s;orrowful and mortifying reflections.</P>
<P>His mother had come a part of the way to meet him. With what joy did &s;he behold her dear &s;on once more! The head ma&s;ter's letters had before informed her of his happy reforma|tion: he now brought one from him, the con|tents of which were &s;till more flattering. A mother only wi&s;hes for new rea&s;ons, to love her &s;on with redoubled fondne&s;s. Tho&s;e rea&s;ons &s;he found in the idea that Lorenzo had reformed his conduct, only out of affection for her; and, with a mother's eye, &s;he looked pre&s;agingly forward to the happine&s;s of his future life.</P>
<P>Lorenzo did not di&s;appoint the&s;e hopes. Af|ter dedicating a few days to the vi&s;its of his re|lations and friends, he returned, with fre&s;h ardor, to a life of application. The habit of being al|ways
<PB N="177" REF="045437_0175_1020290F5B309240">
employed, gave &s;trength to his under&s;tand|ing, &s;o that he &s;oon acquired every information nece&s;&s;ary, to qualify him for putting him&s;elf at the head of his family affairs. The manage|ment of them was too laborious for a tender wo|man, already much depre&s;&s;ed by her grief; and her &s;on's activity, diligence and &s;kill, &s;oon brought them into a flouri&s;hing &s;tate. A wealthy e&s;tabli&s;hment, which he formed &s;oon after, and the good order with which he conducted it, pla|ced him in a &s;ituation, &s;ufficiently at ea&s;e, to ena|ble him to undertake, him&s;elf, the education of his numerous children. He endeavored, above all things, to make them thoroughly perceive the ine&s;timable value of time; and to caution them, by his own experience, again&s;t ever expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the unplea&s;ant regret of having illy employed it.</P>

<P>MR. MEANWELL, who had been long ab&s;ent from his native country, on ac|count of a con&s;iderable employment that he held in the Ea&s;t-Indies, was at length returned to his family, in order to enjoy, in their peaceful &s;oci|ety, the ample fruits of his labors. He had but one &s;on, about fourteen years of age, in whom his fonde&s;t hopes were centered. It was in or|der to &s;ecure to this &s;on the advantages of a

&s;plendid fortune, that he had devoted his life to bu&s;ine&s;s of the mo&s;t laborious nature, far from his country and his friends. His views, in this re&s;pect, had been gratified beyond the extent of his wi&s;hes. He returned, loaded with wealth; but, alas! he very &s;oon perceived how much better the time which he had &s;pent in acquiring it, would have been employed, in per&s;onal atten|tion to his &s;on's improvement, and how much more likely &s;uch an attention would have been, to en&s;ure him happine&s;s, than all his riches.</P>
<P>Mrs. Meanwell, who was as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">k in under|&s;tanding as in con&s;titution, had put young Ja&s;|per under the care of a family-tutor, who, in or|der to keep his employment, had only &s;tudied to gratify the child's whims, and impo&s;e on the blind fondne&s;s of a mother, who idolized her &s;on. Intoxicated with the flattery of all about him, Ja&s;per had in&s;en&s;ibly grown hardened in all the ill-habits that he had been &s;uffered to con|tract from his infancy. His tutor, who&s;e igno|rance, though tolerably profound, &s;carce equalled his meanne&s;s, frequently gave him to under&s;tand, that with the trea&s;ures which he was one day to po&s;&s;e&s;s, he had no occa&s;ion to impair his health by a clo&s;e application to &s;tudy; and that For|tune, by the care which &s;he had taken of him, had too favorably di&s;tingui&s;hed him from the re&s;t of mankind, to &s;ubject him to the &s;ame labours. The&s;e perfidious in&s;inuations accorded &s;o well with the natural weakne&s;s and pre&s;umption of his pupil, that they effected the complete corrup|tion of his heart and his under&s;tanding; Ja&s;per was therefore become a confirmed liar, &s;lothful,
<PB N="179" REF="045437_0177_1020291544F03C88">
in&s;en&s;ible to the affections of his fellow-creatures, and &s;o di&s;gu&s;tingly conceited, as to look down upon all who were his inferiors in fortune, as if they were no, better than bea&s;ts of the field. Of all the &s;tories with which the tutor amu&s;ed his idlene&s;s, he li&s;tened only to tho&s;e that afforded examples of pride and effrontery. In&s;tances of courage, greatne&s;s of &s;oul, and humanity, made no impre&s;&s;ion upon him; nor were his eyes ever moi&s;tened with tho&s;e delicious tears which the recital of a virtuous action draws from the eyes of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s true genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>This odious character was not long concealed from Mr. Meanwell's ob&s;ervation. What a fa|tal di&s;covery for an affectionate father, who, re|turning from the farthe&s;t parts of the earth, with the hopes of one day finding, in his &s;on, the comfort and glory of his old age, &s;aw him al|ready po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every quality that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> unpro|mi&s;ing and di&s;graceful. His fir&s;t care was, to di&s;|mi&s;s the contemptible per&s;on, who had been made his in&s;tructor. Notwith&s;tanding the bodi|ly infirmities which already began to attack him, he re&s;olved to take upon him&s;elf alone, the charge of remedying the faulty education of his &s;on. He imagined, however, that he &s;hould &s;ucceed better in this undertaking, if he placed near him a child of a good di&s;po&s;ition, and nearly his own age, who&s;e behaviour might in&s;pire him with a noble emulation. The choice of &s;uch a com|panion, he thought, &s;hould not be left to chance. For &s;everal weeks he &s;ought ineffectually for &s;uch an one, but happening one day to be riding in the country, and earne&s;tly meditating upon his

project, he perceived, at the entrance of a village, a number of young boys at play: one of them was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o happy a phy&s;iognomy, that, at the fir&s;t fight, Mr. Meanwell was captivated with him. He approached him, a&s;ked him a few que&s;tions, in a mild tone of voice, and received an&s;wers &s;o replete with candor and &s;implicity, that they effectually confirmed in his mind the good opinion which the youth's countenance had excited. He learned from him, that he was the elde&s;t of &s;ix children, that his father was the apothecary of the village, and barely able to maintain him and the re&s;t of his family in the mo&s;t limited mediocrity. The&s;e particulars hav|ing given Mr. Meanwell &s;ome hopes, he begged the boy, who&s;e name was Emilius, to conduct him to his father. He found him to be a &s;en&s;i|ble man, and one who&s;e abilities, in a more en|larged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">here, might have procured him the high|e&s;t e&s;timation. But, moderate in his de&s;ires, he preferred the tranquility of a retired country life, to the noi&s;y bu&s;tle of the capital, and contented him&s;elf with the happine&s;s of doing good to his poor neighbours, and of fulfilling the duty of a parent, to his numerous children. His wife, who was &s;till young, had adopted his views, and pru|dence &s;eemed to divide, with happine&s;s, the go|vernment of his family. Mr. Meanwell, after having, for &s;ome time, di&s;cour&s;ed with them con|cerning their children, in order the better to un|der&s;tand the principles which they had followed in their education, &s;oon perceived them to be &s;uch as corre&s;ponded with his own ideas. In the fullne&s;s of his joy, he took the apothecary by the
<PB N="181" REF="045437_0179_1020291B299CB9A8">
hand, and imparted to him the de&s;ign that he had in view, with re&s;pect to his &s;on, a&s;&s;uring him, that he would bring him up as his own, and that from that day forward he would take upon him the care of his fortune. The well-known integrity of Mr. Meanwell, and the reputation of his wealth and intere&s;t, would have induced pa|rents, who were le&s;s affectionate, or more ambi|tious, to accept his offers, without he&s;itation: but the parents of Emilius found a difficulty in parting with a &s;on, who formed their principal happine&s;s; and the boy him&s;elf was no le&s;s a|ver&s;e to the propo&s;al, than they were. However, the more objections they rai&s;ed to the &s;cheme, the more Mr. Meanwell, actuated by fre&s;h &s;enti|ments of e&s;teem, adhered to it. In &s;hort, he redoubled his &s;olicitations &s;o powerfully, that he, at length, &s;hook their re&s;olution. The frequent opportunities which would offer of &s;eeing their &s;on, and the hope that his advancement might, one day, contribute to that of his brothers and &s;i&s;ters, induced them, at length, to yield their con&s;ent; and Mr. Meanwell took his leave, filled with the mo&s;t perfect and heartfelt &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Three days were demanded by the parents of Emilius, to prepare him for appearing in town; at the end of that time, Mr. Meanwell appeared at their door. I will not attempt to de&s;cribe to you the grief occa&s;ioned by the departure of a child, &s;o dearly loved by his family. Emilius, who had had the courage to re&s;train his tears in the pre&s;ence of his mother, for fear of increa&s;ing her &s;orrow, was no &s;ooner &s;eated in the carriage, than he let fall a flood of tears. Mr. Meanwell
<PB N="182" REF="045437_0180_1020291F8244F690">
did not &s;eek, at fir&s;t, to interrupt them, otherwi&s;e than by &s;ilent care&s;&s;es; but when the fir&s;t gu&s;h of &s;orrow was over, he took Emilius by the hand, and, ki&s;&s;ing him, My boy, &s;aid he, be not afflicted; you &s;ee in me a &s;econd father, who will cheri&s;h you with as much affection as the parent whom nature has given you. Be hone&s;t, cour|teous, and diligent, and nothing &s;hall ever be wanting to your happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Emilius was &s;omething ea&s;ed by the&s;e marks of tenderne&s;s and affection. Then you &s;hall be my other father, &s;aid he, pre&s;&s;ing Mr. Mean|well's hand between his, and I will make my&s;elf worthy of your friend&s;hip and regard.</P>
<P>Mr. Meanwell introduced Emilius into his hou&s;e, upon the footing of a &s;on, and ordered all his &s;ervants to treat him with the &s;ame re&s;pect; and his mild and &s;en&s;ible manner, &s;oon gained him the affection of all that approached him. Ja&s;per was the only per&s;on of the family, who could not behold him, without an emotion of envy. He &s;oon perceived that the pre&s;ence of this rival laid him under the nece&s;&s;ity of altering his behaviour, and of becoming more diligent in his &s;tudies. Not being able to find in his heart any ju&s;t foundation for hating Emilius, he thought that he might at lea&s;t rea&s;onably de&s;pi&s;e him, as the &s;oon of a poor country apothecary. Dread|ing, however, his father's di&s;plea&s;ure, he was o|bliged to keep the&s;e thoughts to him&s;elf, and therefore di&s;gui&s;ed them under the ma&s;k of friend|&s;hip. Emilius, who could not &s;u&s;pect in others a fal&s;hood to which his own heart was a &s;tran|ger, grew tenderly attached to him; he endea|voured
<PB N="183" REF="045437_0181_102029214901D110">
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in all his exertions, and to facilitate the labours of his &s;tudy; at the &s;ame time, he put up with his pride and capriciou&s;ne&s;s, as one u&s;ually winks at the defects of a beloved friend.</P>
<P>He had already been accu&s;tomed, under the immediate direction of his father, to exert his powers of apprehen&s;ion, &s;o that he met with no|thing, in the cour&s;e of his &s;tudy, that was capa|ble of damping his ardour. Endowed with a lively penetration, and a powerful memory, and, e&s;pecially, animated with the de&s;ire of meriting the applau&s;e and encouragement of Mr. Mean|well, he made &s;o rapid a progre&s;s, that his ma&s;ters could &s;carcely believe it po&s;&s;ible. He improved him&s;elf no le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sfully in the exerci&s;es of the body; thus his manners became graceful, at the &s;ame time that his under&s;tanding was enlighten|ed, and his heart expanded with &s;entiments of honor and genero&s;ity. Mr. Meanwell beheld him every day, with renewed affection; and even &s;trangers were &s;eldom twice in his company, with|out feeling a &s;ecret prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour. Polite, without affectation, attentive, without &s;er|vility, chearful, without thoughtle&s;sne&s;s, he enli|vened, by his pre&s;ence, the joy and happine&s;s of the whole family. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e flat|tering circum&s;tances, Emilius, far from &s;uffering the illu&s;ions of vanity to &s;teal upon him, became only the more mode&s;t. Although he could not be in&s;en&s;ible to his own &s;uperiority over Ja&s;per, he would have been contented to call it in que&s;|tion, and &s;till better plea&s;ed to have hid it from the ob&s;ervation of others, for fear of mortifying
<PB N="184" REF="045437_0182_102029259E866078">
his friend. He was the fir&s;t to defend him, or to make him appear to advantage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. Ah! &s;aid he to him&s;elf, if my friend had not been &s;o benefi|cent to me, and &s;o powerfully a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in eve|ry laudable acquirement, '&s;pite of the affection|ate cares of my father, I &s;hould &s;till be far from knowing even what little I know. Other chil|dren, in my &s;ituation, would, perhaps, have pro|fited better from the opportunities indulged me by Providence. Ja&s;per him&s;elf would, perhaps, have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed me, had he been in my &s;ituation, and I in his. He can do without learning, better than I can; the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of acquiring it, has done every thing for me.</P>
<P>Eight years pa&s;&s;ed on thus, during which, E|milius made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of every accompli&s;h|ment that is conferred by the mo&s;t liberal educa|tion. Time and place would fail me, were I de|&s;irous to particularize to you the various mental acquirements with which he had &s;tored his un|der&s;tanding. As to Ja&s;per, it would be a &s;till longer ta&s;k, to enumerate all tho&s;e which he had not. His natural &s;elf-&s;ufficiency had per&s;uaded him, that with a few terms of &s;cience, which was all that remained to him from his &s;tudies, he was a match for &s;ome of the able&s;t ma&s;ters. His di&s;po&s;ition, in the mean time, was, at bottom, very little altered; the fear of his father had, indeed, a little re&s;trained his vicious impetuo&s;i|ties, but, in return, it had be&s;towed on him hy|pocri&s;y, as a convenient ma&s;k to conceal them.</P>
<P>Mr. Meanwell, who&s;e penetrating eye ob&s;erved them, even through this veil, would have fallen a victim to the chagrin which he felt on this mor|tifying
<PB N="185" REF="045437_0183_102029288FA13C68">
di&s;covery, if the good behaviour of Emi|lius had not afforded him a plea&s;ing con&s;olation. Neverthele&s;s, when Ja&s;per had reached his twen|tieth year, the apprehen&s;ions that he formed to him&s;elf of his &s;on's future impropriety of con|duct, overbalanced every other con&s;ideration. While his heart was torn with the&s;e cruel reflec|tions, he was &s;eized with a violent di&s;order, which carried him off in a few days, in &s;pite of the affectionate cares and ardent wi&s;hes that E|milius te&s;tified for his recovery, even to the fatal moment which &s;eparated them for ever.</P>
<P>Ja&s;per, freed as he now was from the curb which formerly re&s;trained his pa&s;&s;ions, had &s;carce|ly paid the la&s;t offices to his father, before he be|gan to &s;hew forth his natural di&s;po&s;ition. Un|grateful to the memory of an excellent father, in the per&s;on whom he had adopted as a &s;econd &s;on, and forgetting the obligations that he him|&s;elf bore to the &s;ame youth, he furiou&s;ly &s;hut his doors upon him, and flew down to his paternal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eat in the country, there to make him&s;elf amends for his former con&s;traint, by indulging a life of &s;avage tumult and unbridled licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>How different were the emotions which im|pelled the heart of Emilius, who was now re|turned to the mediocrity of his father's hou&s;e! he grieved, indeed, but not on account of his change of condition. Mr. Meanwell had made him a hand&s;ome provi&s;ion for life; but his in|tere&s;t gave him very little concern; it was the lo&s;s of his generous benefactor that he felt mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly: the recent lo&s;s of that friend who had taken care of his youth, whom he was accu&s;tom|ed
<PB N="186" REF="045437_0184_1020292A1CE95630">
to look upon as a father, and in whom he had found all the affections of one. The &s;orrow oc|ca&s;ioned by this lo&s;s, brought on a &s;ickne&s;s, which had nearly &s;ent him after the friend whom he mourned. In the mo&s;t violent fits of his deliri|um, he pronounced only the name of Mr. Mean|well. He even called his father by this name, whenever he &s;at by his bed, as the di&s;order de|prived him of all knowledge of his relations. They were long apprehen&s;ive for his life: in ef|fect, he owed his recovery to the vows and inde|fatigable cares of a family, who all &s;eemed only to exi&s;t in him.</P>
<P>After devoting a few months to the &s;atisfacti|on which his friends enjoyed in &s;eeing his health re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, and in admiring his virtues and accompli&s;hments, Emilius returned to the capi|tal, intending to enter upon one of the learned profe&s;&s;ions, and, in the mean time, re&s;uming his &s;tudies with more eagerne&s;s and advantage than ever. He had gained the friend&s;hip and e&s;teem of many per&s;ons of quality, during his re&s;idence at the hou&s;e of Mr. Meanwell, who now united all their intere&s;t to procure him an advantageous e&s;tabli&s;hment. The duke of&mdash;, having ju&s;t fini&s;hed his &s;tudies, was about to make the tour of Europe, and Emilius was recommended to his family, as a proper per&s;on to accompany him. Though he appeared very young, for &s;uch an office, he, neverthele&s;s, impre&s;&s;ed them &s;o fa|vourably, with re&s;pect to his character and con|duct, that he was judged to be as tru&s;ty and in|telligent a governor as they could &s;end with the young nobleman. In the cour&s;e of this tour, he
<PB N="187" REF="045437_0185_1020292EAC383C78">
found numberle&s;s opportunities of enlarging and applying the knowledge that he had acquired from &s;tudy. His &s;prightly wit and engaging manners, made him a favorite at every court which his pupil vi&s;ited. There were even &s;ome foreign princes, who di&s;tingui&s;hed him in a very flattering manner, and wi&s;hed to attach him to their &s;ervice; but his engagements to the young duke's family, made him decline every offer, how|ever &s;plendid. He was not long, without receiv|ing the reward of his fidelity. He had &s;carce conducted his pupil home to his native country, when a nobleman of the &s;ame family, being ap|pointed amba&s;&s;ador to one of the foreign courts, cho&s;e him for his &s;ecretary. During a long ill|ne&s;s of the amba&s;&s;ador, Emilius managed the principal bu&s;ine&s;s of the emba&s;&s;y, which he per|formed with &s;o much ability, that, upon the mi|ni&s;ter's recommendation, he was entru&s;ted with a very delicate negociation, in which he had the honor, as well as &s;atisfaction, of rendering his country a &s;ervice of the mo&s;t important nature.</P>
<P>Ja&s;per, in the mean time, had met with very different fortune: we left him in the country, upon his e&s;tate, hara&s;&s;ing his game and his te|nants. This way of life gave the fini&s;hing &s;troke to his manners; that is to &s;ay, it rendered them tho&s;e of a brute, and his under&s;tanding &s;eemed degraded to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t degree of ru&s;ticity. A quarrel with a neighboring country gentleman, in which his paltry behaviour covered him with &s;hame and mortification, forced him to quit his country re&s;idence, and to come up again to Lon|don: but even thither his infamy pur&s;ued him;
<PB N="188" REF="045437_0186_1020293034A399E8">
and being aggravated with the additional im|peachment of fraud, became a &s;ubject of the mo&s;t public notoriety.</P>
<P>Ja&s;per now found him&s;elf excluded from all genteel company, where his father's name had formerly procured him a welcome. Unable to find a re&s;ource, either in &s;tudy or reflection, he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be carried away by the torrent of vicious example; and gaming &s;oon &s;ugge&s;ted to him the de&s;ign of &s;elling his e&s;tate, and after|wards furni&s;hed him with opportunities of di&s;&s;i|pating his money, while intemperance and de|bauch, at the &s;ame time, made rapid havock with his con&s;titution. In order to elude his creditors, who&s;e importunities now became pre&s;&s;ing, he determined to tran&s;port him&s;elf to the continent, and, by a &s;ingular accident, arrived in the very &s;ame town where Emilius re&s;ided, and where, for his many amiable and re&s;pectable qualities, he enjoyed the univer&s;al e&s;teem of all parties.</P>
<P>The unhappy Ja&s;per carried with him &s;till his extravagant pa&s;&s;ion for play: fortune &s;eemed at fir&s;t to favour him in this new &s;cene; and his ex|pen&s;ive manner of living procured him credit. But it was not long, before his affairs fell into confu&s;ion; and his creditors, finding that he had treated them with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t impo&s;itions, &s;ent him to pri&s;on, upon his not being able to &s;atisfy their demands. The rumour of &s;uch a di&s;grace happening to one of his countrymen, &s;oon occa|&s;ioned Emilius to come to the knowledge of his name. "Heavens!" cried he, "is the &s;on of my deare&s;t benefactor in a pri&s;on?" for he im|mediately forgot Ja&s;per's ungenerous behaviour
<PB N="189" REF="045437_0187_1020293323E5AE98">
toward him. He flew, therefore, to the dunge|on where he was confined. But, alas! in what a dreadful condition did he find him! Pale, dis|figured, pining in di&s;tre&s;s, wa&s;ted by pain, har|rowed by remor&s;e, and a prey to all the convul|&s;ions of rage and de&s;pair. He &s;trikes off his chains, &s;natches him from this man&s;ion of hor|ror, carries him to his own hou&s;e, and there treats him with the mo&s;t affectionate care and attenti|on. He would have &s;acrificed all his fortune to re&s;tore him to life, and to be the author of his happine&s;s. But heaven had already dealt the a|venging blow. Ja&s;per &s;urvived this event but a few days. Emilius was grieved at his death, as much as if he had lo&s;t the mo&s;t affectionate friend. He was incon&s;olable, that fate had put it out of his power to render to the &s;on of his benefactor the kindne&s;&s;es which he had received from the father. This reflection depre&s;&s;ed his &s;pirits a con&s;iderable time. Images of gloomy &s;adne&s;s were ever before his eyes, and haunted him, even in his mo&s;t collected hours of bu&s;ine&s;s; but the alacrity with which he attended to his duty, and the command which he was accu&s;tomed to exer|ci&s;e over him&s;elf, re&s;tored him at length to his u|&s;ual &s;erenity of mind; and he continued to per|form the offices of his employ, with a zeal and integrity, that &s;oon advanced him to the exalted &s;tation in which we &s;ee him at this day.</P>

<HEAD>THE PUNISHMENT OF PRIDE.</HEAD>
<P>RUPERT, the &s;on of an hone&s;t laborer, had early te&s;tified a &s;trong inclination for the profe&s;&s;ion of arms. He was continually exerci|&s;ing with his &s;pade, and had &s;craped acquaintance with every game-keeper in the neighborhood, in order that he might have an opportunity of hand|ling their fowling-pieces. At the age of eigh|teen, he enli&s;ted as a &s;oldier; and being (through the good care which his father had taken of his education) a tolerable proficient in writing and figures, he was very &s;oon made corporal, and, af|ter that, &s;erjeant.</P>
<P>At the commencement of the war, his regi|ment going abroad, he behaved him&s;elf &s;o re|markably well, the fir&s;t ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">paign, as to obtain a pair of colours. He had been &s;ent upon &s;everal hazardous expeditions, in which he &s;hewed him|&s;elf to be equally intelligent and brave; and it was remarked, to his prai&s;e, that a &s;oldier had never turned his back, while under his command.</P>
<P>The general, who had been a witne&s;s to his bravery, in many engagements, now promoted him to the command of a company, in order to rai&s;e the emulation of his troops, by the exam|ple of Rupert's good fortune. And, &s;ome cam|paigns after, a very &s;plendid action, that he per|formed in a battle in which mo&s;t of the elder cap|tains
<PB N="191" REF="045437_0189_1020293913AEDD38">
were killed, was the occa&s;ion of his being elevated to the po&s;t of major.</P>
<P>Honorable mention had frequently been made of his name in the public papers; and his bro|thers were often gratified by their neighbors, with the recital of actions con&s;iderably to his prai&s;e. It may ea&s;ily be imagined how proud they were of being &s;o nearly related to him. Whenever they &s;poke of him, they &s;hed tears of joy. Their affection to him &s;eemed to entitle them to a &s;hare in his reputation; and they wi&s;hed for the hap|py moment of his &s;afe return, that they might embrace a brother who did &s;o much honor to his kindred.</P>
<P>With all the&s;e good qualities, however, Ru|pert po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed one which was very odious; his words and actions were marked with the mo&s;t in&s;upportable arrogance. There was no man in the world (to take his word for it) &s;o &s;en&s;ible, or &s;o intrepid as him&s;elf. He &s;poke of his own va|liant deeds, as a flattering courtier would of tho&s;e of a &s;overeign prince, before his face. He arro|gated to him&s;elf more glory from them, than was ju&s;tly due to him; and &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible to the merit of the other officers, whenever they ac|quitted them&s;elves with as much gallantry as him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of the war, his regiment re|turning home, was &s;ent into country quarters, and (as it happened) by a route that led very near his own native village. As &s;oon as ever his bro|thers were apprized of this circum&s;tance, they went off to meet him on the road, accompanied by a few friends, and arrived in a neighboring
<PB N="192" REF="045437_0190_1020293D6CF56640">
town, ju&s;t as the divi&s;ion which he commanded of the regiment had entered, and was forming in the market-place.</P>
<P>My dear Rupert, &s;aid the elder brother, how happy I am to &s;ee thee, and how happy would our aged father be, were he alive this day! Hea|ven be prai&s;ed that we behold you &s;afe returned from the dangers of war. For my part, I never felt my&s;elf &s;o happy in my life as at this moment. Saying the&s;e words, he held out his hand, invi|ting Rupert to a &s;imilar demon&s;tration of frater|nal amity. But the major, &s;welling with &s;hame and indignation, to &s;ee a man, in a frize coat, call him brother, rejected his proffered &s;alutation. You had better go home, &s;aid he, my friend. I have not time to talk to you at pre&s;ent. How! cried the younger brother, do not you know me neither? Look well at me: I am your brother George. You u&s;ed to be very fond of me. It was from you that I learned to plow, when I was a boy.</P>
<P>The major now foamed with rage and de&s;pite, and having no other means to be rid of his un|welcome relations, he cau&s;ed his &s;oldiers to make a &s;udden movement or evolution, which obliged the &s;urrounding populace, and, among the re&s;t, his brothers, to fall back, and retire from the &s;pot of ground where he &s;tood.</P>
<P>The two pea&s;ants, who had promi&s;ed them|&s;elves &s;o much joy and happine&s;s in meeting with a brother that had been ab&s;ent from them &s;o ma|ny years, returned home, full of grief and re&s;ent|ment. They were &s;carce able to credit their &s;en&s;es, that &s;uch had been their indifferent recep|tion
<PB N="193" REF="045437_0191_1020293EF654E3C8">
with one whom, notwith&s;tanding his unna|tural pride, they found them&s;elves ready &s;till to love as a brother.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiers who were pre&s;ent at this di&s;gu&s;t|ing &s;cene, did not, it is true, expre&s;s their &s;enti|ments of it aloud, but they &s;aid to each other, in whi&s;pers, A man mu&s;t have a very bad heart in|deed, to be a&s;hamed of his relations. Does our major think it a di&s;grace to be the &s;ame as we are? He ought, much rather, to be proud of having made his way, in the army, by merit, than to put on the airs of a man of family.</P>
<P>Rupert had not a &s;oul formed for thinking &s;o nobly: in&s;tead of remembering that he had once been a private &s;oldier, he thought, by his a&s;&s;umed loftine&s;s, to make his former comrades forget it. He treated them, therefore, with the la&s;t degree of contempt; but he appeared, in their eyes, much more worthy of this pa&s;&s;ion. His prefer|ment, which before had given them &s;o much &s;a|tisfaction, now only &s;erved to mortify them. They obeyed his orders, but with reluctance; and every &s;oldier in the regiment, wi&s;hed him fairly out of it.</P>
<P>One day, when the corps to which he belong|ed, was pa&s;&s;ing in review before a general, this officer made &s;ome remarks on the manoeuvres performed by the major, with his divi&s;ion, to which the latter replied in terms of the mo&s;t pointed di&s;re&s;pect. His &s;upercilious deportment had, already, more than once, offended his gene|rals. This fre&s;h breach of military &s;ubordina|tion, underwent the &s;evere&s;t animadver&s;ion; for, as it was too public and gro&s;s to be pa&s;&s;ed over in

&s;ilence, it became the &s;ubject of a general-court-martial, the deci&s;ion of which compleated his ruin; for, even here, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in lan|guage &s;o unguardedly per&s;onal again&s;t his pro&s;e|cutor, and per&s;i&s;ted, with &s;uch inflexible haughti|ne&s;s, in refu&s;ing to make a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that he was &s;entenced to be ca&s;hiered, to the univer&s;al joy of his regiment.</P>
<P>Reduced, by this &s;troke, to his original pover|ty, he was obliged to embrace the alternative, ei|ther of &s;truggling with indigence and nece&s;&s;ity, or of employing means for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, which, before, he would have &s;purned, as unworthy of his rank and con&s;equence. He had a &s;mall farm (if a piece of ground might be &s;o called, that was &s;carcely large enough for a cabbage-garden) &s;ituated clo&s;e by his native village. As (by his father's will) he had not the power of &s;elling it, in the life time of his brothers, he had let it to one of them upon his entering the army, but al|ways thought the rent of it, though accumulat|ing, an object of &s;o &s;mall importance, particular|ly after he was made an officer, that he had, &s;ince that time, in his own mind, almo&s;t wholly re|nounced the property of it, as he had the memo|ry of his origin, and the relation&s;hip of the per|&s;on who was his tenant. He now found him|&s;elf, however, under the nece&s;&s;ity of deriving, from this patch of ground, the means of his im|mediate &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, by making application to his brother for the rent ari&s;ing from it. For this purpo&s;e, a journey to the place of his nativity was, if not indi&s;pen&s;able, at lea&s;t highly expedi|ent; and then it was when the pea&s;ants and vil|lagers,

his former acquaintances, &s;aw him come down among them, &s;tripped of his plumes, and reduced to the &s;ame &s;tate of harmle&s;s ob&s;curity with them&s;elves, that they repaid him his former in&s;olence, with u&s;ury. However, as he courted the friend&s;hip of none, in return none offered him their &s;ociety. Thus he &s;aw him&s;elf depri|ved of one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings that human life can afford, particularly to tho&s;e who are un|der the pre&s;&s;ure of adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>If the other inhabitants of the village were of|fended at Rupert's unnatural pride, his brothers had, certainly, the fir&s;t cau&s;e to re&s;ent it, having been the more immediate objects of his in&s;ult. Perhaps, therefore, you fear, le&s;t they &s;hould, in their turn, have &s;lighted him. "We know you not," would have been a ju&s;t an&s;wer to all his applications and advances toward reconcili|ation: but, fortunately for him, the brothers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that real greatne&s;s of &s;pirit which he wanted. They &s;ought no other &s;atisfaction, than that of conferring kindne&s;&s;es on him. For this purpo&s;e, the renter of his little farm, not only re|&s;tored it to him in good condition, together with the revenues thence accruing, but concerted with the other brother, the means of &s;ettling him comfortably, on a moderate farm, if he cho&s;e to embrace that way of life. This, as they were thriving, re&s;pon&s;ible per&s;ons, they found no great difficulty to effect; and Rupert returned once more to the happy occupation, from which am|bitious and chimerical dreams of glory, had for|merly &s;educed him. But he was, by no means, happy in his condition. Every day, as he went

about tho&s;e labours, which he had &s;o long di&s;|dained, the thoughts of his former elevated hopes and expectations, continually haunted him. How did he &s;uffer, under the mortifying thought, that he owed almo&s;t his pre&s;ent exi&s;tence, to tho&s;e, whom he, on the contrary, might, comparatively &s;peaking, have made rich men. Accur&s;ed pride! he would &s;ay, to what a pitiable degree ha&s;t thou humbled me!</P>
<P>This cutting reflection filled his hours with bitterne&s;s; and he died, in a &s;hort time, devour|ed with chagrin, leaving a melancholy example to tho&s;e whom the &s;ame intoxicating pa&s;&s;ion might tempt to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;ound admonitions of rea&s;on and mode&s;ty.</P>

<HEAD>THE INCREASE OF FAMILY.</HEAD>
<P>HONEST farmer Town&s;end was on a vi|&s;it to his &s;i&s;ter, who had been a few years married, and lived at the di&s;tance of nine or ten miles from his habitation. One evening, a little before &s;upper, as he &s;at with her and her hu&s;band be&s;ide their cottage door, and di&s;cour&s;ed with them concerning family affairs, there pa&s;&s;ed by a little girl about five years of age, and totally in rags. Town&s;end remarked the mi&s;erable ap|pearance of her whole per&s;on, and &s;aid to his &s;i&s;ter, "There is a poor little girl, very much to
<PB N="197" REF="045437_0195_1020294AB9C12FD0">
be pitied. Not one rag about her &s;eems to af|ford her a covering. It is a di&s;grace to your pa|ri&s;h. Her father mu&s;t have very little indu&s;try, and her mother very little feeling."</P>
<P>Alas! an&s;wered his &s;i&s;ter, &s;he has no father nor mother, and there are two other children, be&s;ide her, of the &s;ame family, who are equally wretched. Through &s;ome di&s;pute between two different pari&s;hes, (each a&s;&s;erting this de&s;titute family to belong to the other) the poor children wander up and down the country, without hou&s;e or home. They lie, at night, in barns, or under hedges. When hunger becomes trou|ble&s;ome, they go and &s;it down before the doors of cottages. If any body gives them a mor&s;el of bread, they receive it with joy; but they ne|ver a&s;k any thing. Their father, who was a man of &s;pirit, though reduced by &s;ickne&s;s, to the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t deplorable &s;tate of poverty, forbad them, with his dying lips, to beg.</P>
<P>This recital affected the hone&s;t farmer very much. It is &s;hocking, &s;aid he, that any poor creatures &s;hould be &s;o neglected by the re&s;t of their &s;pecies: I will take them, added he, under my care, &s;ince nobody here wi&s;hes to be charged with them. His &s;i&s;ter, and her hu&s;band, thought it their duty to di&s;&s;uade him, as &s;trongly as po&s;&s;i|ble, from this undertaking. They told him, that he had children of his own, that he knew nothing about the&s;e, that they were, for three months pa&s;t, accu&s;tomed to a lazy vagabond life, and that it was a matter of doubt, whether they would ever turn to good. Then, brother, con|&s;ider, added they, what an addition of trouble
<PB N="198" REF="045437_0196_1020294DE05EE938">
they will cau&s;e to your wife, and what a burden they will be in your family.</P>
<P>Town&s;end was not one of tho&s;e weak men, who &s;uffer them&s;elves to be diverted from the performance of a laudable de&s;ign, by a few diffi|culties accompanying it. He was not very &s;oli|citous to hear all their objections, and &s;till le&s;s to an&s;wer them.</P>
<P>He ro&s;e, therefore, from his &s;eat, in order to retire to re&s;t: but his &s;cheme of benevolence, in favour of the orphans, kept him long awake, by exciting, in his mind, reflections of a tenderer ca&s;t than u&s;ual; and the moi&s;ture of generous compa&s;&s;ion was &s;till upon his eyelids, when they clo&s;ed in &s;leep for the night.</P>
<P>The next morning early, he &s;ent for the elde&s;t girl, who was about twelve years of age. I was given, &s;aid he, to under&s;tand, ye&s;terday, that your father and mother are dead, and I &s;ee, by your dre&s;s, that they have not left you any great mat|ters of fortune.</P>

<P>Come, then, that is &s;ettled: but I am going home on hor&s;eback, and could not take you all three together. It was the younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter that I &s;aw fir&s;t: I will begin with her.
<PB N="199" REF="045437_0197_10202950D346A588">
Bring the child to me. Let us be acquainted together.</P>
<P>The younge&s;t girl &s;oon came. She had a countenance &s;o mild, and gained &s;o much upon the farmer, by her little fond care&s;&s;es, that he looked upon him&s;elf already as her father. He took her up, therefore, before him, on his hor&s;e; and when they arrived at the farm-hou&s;e, his wife a&s;ked him who&s;e child that was. It is your's, Maria, an&s;wered he, and began withal to relate to her, how, the day before, he had &s;een the little child, and been informed of her wretched and friendle&s;s &s;ituation; how he had compa&s;&s;ion on her, and took her home with him, in order to &s;upport her as one of his own children.</P>
<P>During all this relation, the little girl crept clo&s;e to the farmer's &s;kirt, and &s;hed tears without cea&s;ing. Maria, who was as compa&s;&s;ionate as her hu&s;band, &s;ympathized with the little orphan; &s;he took her up in her lap, and endeavoured to &s;oothe her with the&s;e words: "Since my hu&s;|band has promi&s;ed to be your father, I will be your mother too. Come then, my dear child, do not cry any more."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Town&s;end.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! my dear, I &s;ee what you mean. Well, we mu&s;t &s;end for them.</P>
<P>The next day, the farmer put the hor&s;e to his chai&s;e-cart, and went for the other two orphans.</P>
<P>Go, &s;aid his wife, embracing him at his depar|ture, go, my dear; and that Being, who &s;ends

us the&s;e children, will not fail to &s;end us, al&s;o, bread for their nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Mr. Ju&s;tice Garboil, however, thought other|wi&s;e. He had been landlord to the father of the&s;e unfortunate little ones, and was well appri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed of their di&s;tre&s;s. Hearing the farmer had taken them home to his hou&s;e, he di&s;patched his clerk to him, with a peremptory injunction to &s;end the children to their own &s;ettlement, (which, it has been ob&s;erved before, was in litigation) or, in failure thereof, to give &s;ecurity to his own pa|ri&s;h, that they &s;hould never become chargeable to it.</P>
<P>Farmer Town&s;end was filled with indignation on receiving &s;uch a me&s;&s;age. If this, cried he, be his wor&s;hip's humanity, I would rather be the child of mi&s;ery, for an age, than accept the con|dition of that over&s;woln ba&s;haw, during his mo&s;t &s;elf-complacent hour. Let me know, however, what bail is required; I am ready. Poor inno|cents! the more I &s;ee oppre&s;&s;ion endeavour to tread you down, the dearer you become to me, and the more I feel my&s;elf intere&s;ted to protect you.</P>
<P>After the farmer had &s;atisfied every demand of Ju&s;tice Garboil, he returned to his hou&s;e, and now, &s;aid he, &s;urely the&s;e children are mine. No|body will que&s;tion my being a father to them, by one title or other.</P>
<P>You are anxious, no doubt, my young friends, to know what became of the&s;e children, in the &s;e|quel. Luckily, I can inform you, by relating to you a conver&s;ation between Farmer Town&s;end

and a per&s;on who happened to be travelling in that part of the country, &s;ome years afterwards.</P>
<P>All the little family were at play together, one evening, before the farmer's door, while Maria was getting their &s;upper ready. He him&s;elf was in the mid&s;t of them, partaking of their &s;port and fe&s;tivity. The traveller happened to pa&s;s by, ju&s;t at the time, and &s;topped to gaze on this &s;peci|men of rural happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Are all the&s;e children your's, neighbour? &s;aid he to the farmer.</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, an&s;wered Town&s;end: I have ten of them alive; &s;even that Providence be&s;towed on me, and three that I have purcha&s;ed.</P>
<P>Purcha&s;ed? &s;aid the traveller, much &s;urpri|zed.</P>
<P>Why, Sir, it was, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, a purcha&s;e, replied the farmer, and, upon this, told him the whole &s;tory, adding, as he concluded it, thank heaven, neither my wife nor I have, at any time, repented of the action. It was the be&s;t bargain that ever I made in my life.</P>

<P>It &s;eems, at fir&s;t view, a difficult matter to find bread for them all, without an e&s;|tate; for any one can ea&s;ily &s;pend the fruits of his own labour: and, unle&s;s you were to make a trial, you would &s;carcely think it po&s;&s;ible to be done.

<HEAD>THE HUMOUROUS ENGAGEMENT.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;tory is taken from the hi&s;tory of Sandford and Merton, and the following piece from a Dutch novel, in a &s;eries of letters.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>TOMMY Merton, the &s;on of a gentleman of fortune, and Harry Sandford, the &s;on of an hone&s;t farmer, were both under the care and in&s;truction of Mr. Barlow, a country clergy|man. Harry, in one of his walks with Mr. Bar|low, had &s;aved a young chicken from the claws
<PB N="204" REF="045437_0202_101FFC710F77ABC8">
of a kite. He had taken the greate&s;t care po&s;&s;i|ble of its little wounds, and fed it every day with his own hands. The little animal was now per|fectly recovered of the hurt it had received, and &s;hewed &s;o great a degree of affection to its pro|tector, that it would run after him like a dog, hop upon his &s;houlder, ne&s;tle in his bo&s;om, and eat crumbs out of his hand. Tommy was ex|tremely &s;urprized and plea&s;ed, to remark its tame|ne&s;s and docility, and a&s;ked by what means it had been made &s;o gentle. Harry told him he had taken no particular pains about it, but that, as the poor little creature had been &s;adly hurt, he had fed it every day till it was well, and that in con|&s;equence of that kindne&s;s, it had conceived a great degree of affection toward him. Indeed, &s;aid Tommy, that is very &s;urprizing, for I thought all birds had flown away, whenever a man came near them, and that even the fowls which are kept at home would never let you touch them.</P>

<P>Then a fowl is wild, becau&s;e he will not let you come near him; and will not let you come near him, becau&s;e he is wild: this is &s;aying nothing more than, that when a fowl is wild, he will not let you approach him. But I want to know what is the rea&s;on of his being wild?</P>

<P>No, Sir, I believe not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tommy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then, it is probable that animals are only wild, becau&s;e they are afraid of being hurt, and that they only run away, from the fear of danger. I believe you would do the &s;ame from a lion or a tyger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tommy.</SPEAKER>

<P>And yet you do not call your|&s;elf a wild animal.</P>
</SP>
<P>Tommy laughed heartily at this, and &s;aid, no. Therefore, &s;aid Mr. Barlow, if you want to tame animals, you mu&s;t be good to them, and treat them kindly, and then they will no longer fear you, but come to you, and love you. In|deed, &s;aid Harry, that is very true: for I knew a little boy that took a great fancy to a &s;nake that lived in his father's garden, and when he had his milk for breakfa&s;t, he u&s;ed to &s;it under a nut-tree and whi&s;tle, and the &s;nake would come to him, and eat out of his bowl.</P>

<SPEAKER>Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; he &s;ometimes u&s;ed to give it a pat with his &s;poon, if it ate too fa&s;t; but it never hurt him.</P>
</SP>
<P>Tommy was much plea&s;ed with this conver|&s;ation, and being both good natured, and de&s;irous of making experiments, he determined to try his &s;kill in taming animals. Accordingly he took a large &s;lice of bread in his hand, and went out to &s;eek &s;ome animal, that he might give it to. The fir&s;t thing that he happened to meet, was a &s;ucking pig that had rambled from its mother, and was ba&s;king in the &s;un: Tommy would not neglect the opportunity of &s;hewing his talents; he therefore called Pig, pig, pig, come hither little pig! But the pig, who did not exactly com|prehend his intentions, only grunted, and ran away. You little ungrateful thing, &s;aid Tom|my, do you treat me in this manner, when I want to feed you? If you do not know your friends, I mu&s;t teach you. Saying this, he &s;prung at the pig, and caught him by the hind leg, in|tending to have given him the bread which he had in his hand; but the pig, who was not u&s;ed to be treated in that manner, began &s;truggling and &s;queaking to that degree, that the &s;ow, who was within hearing, came running to the place, with all the re&s;t of the litter, at her heels. As Tommy did not know whether &s;he would be plea&s;ed with his civilities to her young one, or not, he thought it mo&s;t prudent to let it go; and the pig, endeavouring to e&s;cape as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, unfortunately ran between his legs, and threw him down. The place where the ac|cident happened was extremely wet; therefore

Tommy, in falling, dirtied him&s;elf from head to foot, and the &s;ow, who came up at that in|&s;tant, pa&s;&s;ed over him, as he attempted to ri&s;e, and rolled him back again into the mire. Tom|my, who was not the coole&s;t in his temper, was extremely provoked at this ungrateful return for his intended kindne&s;s; and lo&s;ing all patience, he &s;eized the &s;ow by the hind leg, and began pummelling her with all his might, as &s;he at|tempted to e&s;cape. The &s;ow, as may be imagined, did not reli&s;h &s;uch treatment, but endeavoured with all her force to e&s;cape; but Tommy keep|ing his hold, and continuing his di&s;cipline, &s;he &s;truggled with &s;uch violence, as to drag him &s;everal yards, &s;queaking in the mo&s;t lamentable manner, in which &s;he was joined by the whole litter of pigs. During the heat of the conte&s;t, a large flock of gee&s;e happened to be cro&s;&s;ing the road, into the mid&s;t of which the affrighted &s;ow ran headlong, dragging the enraged Tommy at her heels. The go&s;lings retreated with the greate&s;t precipitation, joining their mournful cackling to the general noi&s;e; but a gander, of more than common &s;ize and courage, re&s;enting the unprovoked attack which had been made upon his family, flew at Tommy's hinder parts, and gave him &s;everal &s;evere &s;trokes with his bill. Tommy, who&s;e courage had hitherto been un|conquerable, being thus unexpectedly attacked by a new enemy, was obliged to yield to for|tune; and not knowing the preci&s;e extent of his danger, he not only &s;uffered the &s;ow to e&s;cape, but joined his vociferations to the general &s;cream. This alarmed Mr. Barlow, who, coming up to
<PB N="208" REF="045437_0206_101FFCA1E13772D0">
the place, found his pupil in the mo&s;t woful plight, daubed from head to foot, with his face and hands as black as tho&s;e of any chimney-&s;weeper. He enquired what was the matter, and Tommy, as &s;oon he had recovered breath enough to &s;peak, an&s;wered in this manner; Sir, this is all owing to what you told me about taming ani|mals. I wanted to make them tame and gentle and to love me, and you &s;ee the con&s;equences. Indeed, &s;aid Mr. Barlow, I &s;ee you have been very ill-treated, but I hope you are not hurt; and if it is owing to any thing I have &s;aid, I &s;hall feel the more concern. No, &s;aid Tommy, I cannot &s;ay that I am much hurt. Why then, &s;aid Mr. Barlow, you had better go and wa&s;h your&s;elf; and when you are clean, we will talk over the affair. When Tommy had returned, Mr. Barlow a&s;ked him how the accident had happened, and when he had heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;tory, he &s;aid I am very &s;orry for your misfortune, but I do not perceive that I was the cau&s;e of it, for I do not remember that I ever advi&s;ed you to catch pigs by the hinder legs.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tommy.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; but you told me that feeding animals was the way to make them love me, and &s;o I wanted to feed the pig.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it was not my fault that you attempted it in a wrong manner. The ani|mal did not know your intentions, and there|fore when you &s;eized him in &s;o violent a manner, he naturally attempted to e&s;cape, and his mother hearing his cries, very naturally came to his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. All that happened, was owing to your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">experience; before you meddle with any ani|mal,
<PB N="209" REF="045437_0207_101FFCA366B725E8">
you &s;hould make your&s;elf perfectly acquaint|ed with its nature and di&s;po&s;ition. Had you ob&s;erved this rule, you would never have at|tempted to catch the pig by the hinder leg, in order to tame it; and it is very lucky that you did not make the experiment upon a larger animal.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE part which James I. king of England, took, in the di&s;pute between the bi&s;hops and the Pre&s;byterians, had &s;o violently enraged the latter, that after his death, they took the ad|vantage of &s;ome arbitrary mea&s;ures in the go|vernment of his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Charles I. to excite the whole nation to open revolt. The
<PB N="210" REF="045437_0208_101FFCA60FE13F20">
intent of the Pre&s;byterians was, to annihilate E|pi&s;copacy, and to le&s;&s;en the royal prerogative: but the Independents, a new &s;ect which had &s;prung up from the former, aimed at the total abolition of royalty, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a common|wealth in its &s;tead. Cromwell, who had made both parties equally &s;ub&s;ervient to his ambitious views, declared, at la&s;t, in favour of the indepen|dents. After having filled the parliament and the army with per&s;ons devoted to his fortune, or the dupes of his hypocri&s;y, he procured a formal &s;entence of death to be pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t his &s;ove|reign. The Pre&s;byterians, though they &s;aw them&s;elves plainly outwitted by his cunning, did not dare to ri&s;e up again&s;t the power which he had u&s;urped. Tho&s;e of Scotland had more courage; they called over the elde&s;t &s;on of Charles I. from France, whither he had fled for re|fuge, and they received him as their king, though under the mo&s;t &s;evere re&s;trictions. Cromwell, however, &s;oon marched into Scotland, and de|fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed them in the famous battle of Dunbar, September 3, 1650.</P>
<P>Ho&s;tilities, which were &s;u&s;pended during the winter, began afre&s;h the year following. Charles II. whom the Scots had proclaimed king, was, notwith&s;tanding, &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted at the &s;tate of &s;ubjection and re&s;traint to which they would have reduced him, that he took the re&s;olution of quitting Scotland, whither Cromwell was come to pur&s;ue him, and of entering England with an army of fourteen thou&s;and men, in hopes of &s;eeing it augmented by the Engli&s;h Pre&s;byterians, and the &s;ecret friends of the royal
<PB N="211" REF="045437_0209_101FFCA8997BC5F0">
cau&s;e. But Cromwell did not give him time to receive the&s;e additions of &s;trength: he followed him by forced marches, overtook him with a &s;uperior army, and entirely routed the Scotti&s;h troops. After having fought bravely to the very la&s;t, Charles, with difficulty, e&s;caped off the field of battle, accompanied by fifty men. The di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which he was reduced after his de|feat, obliged him to conceal him&s;elf under the meane&s;t di&s;gui&s;es, in order to e&s;cape from the &s;oldiers, whom Cromwell had &s;ent out, every where, in &s;earch of him; the in&s;tances of fidelity that he received from the Earl of Derby, the companion of his flight, from Colonel Wynd|ham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Drama he is called Lord Wyndham.</NOTE> and his &s;ervants, who kept him concealed, notwith&s;tanding the &s;evere penalties denounced by the parliament; the fanatici&s;m of the parties which then di&s;tracted England, and the deplora|ble &s;tate of the nation in general; during this &s;ea|&s;on of tumult, pre&s;ent a multitude of intere&s;ting &s;ituations, and in&s;tructive &s;cenes, to which the author has endeavoured to give connexion in the following drama, at the &s;ame time, that he has &s;tudied to pre&s;erve hi&s;torical truth in the leading actions of the piece.</P>

<STAGE>Charles dre&s;&s;ed as a pea&s;ant, is hid among the boughs of an oak. Lord Derby, di&s;gui&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, comes out from the middle of a thicket, and advances toward the king.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Lord Derby.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is too &s;oon to quit your re|treat, as yet. The parliament &s;oldiers continue to &s;cour all quarters of the fore&s;t. We are lia|ble, at every &s;tep, to fall into their hands.</P>

<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Derby, I find my&s;elf endowed with &s;ufficient courage to &s;truggle with the chagrin that preys upon my mind, but my body is total|ly broken down with pain and fatigue. I have already pa&s;&s;ed twenty hours in this deplorable &s;ituation. I cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;upport it any long|er.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Derby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sire, I conjure you, put up with the&s;e inconveniences, which cannot be of long durati|on, rather than fall into the hands of your ene|mies. They would be implacable. Our mis|fortune, by intoxicating them with &s;ucce&s;s, has only whetted their barbarity. The weight of it would fall on you. But I hope we &s;hall &s;oon find a retreat more commodious, and le&s;s dan|gerous than this.</P>

<P>It cannot be long before the &s;un will appear. If you thought darkne&s;s &s;o little

favourable to our &s;afety, &s;urely the light of the day will be much more again&s;t us. How &s;hall I be able to hold out till night, in my pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation? The mind arms her&s;elf in vain, with all her force, if the body has lo&s;t what &s;hould &s;u&s;tain her.</P>

<P>I feel, with double weight, the pains that you &s;uffer, and would lay down my life to exempt you from them; but fate controuls our wi&s;hes.

It would give me le&s;s re|gret to lo&s;e you here before my eyes, than to &s;ee you fall into the hands of rebels, and adorn their in&s;olent triumph. I hear &s;oldiers coming.

<P>A right, founded on the good old cau&s;e: Shall the ungodly have dominion over &s;aints?

<P>If you were only to hear Cromwell, he would teach you what to think on the &s;ub|ject.

<P>On what foundation can we build a hope? The royal army is di&s;per&s;ed. If the prince were even living, where would he find forces to retrieve his fortune? His friends, di&s;|heartened by a long &s;eries of overthrows, far from daring to re&s;i&s;t the torrent of rebellion, are, perhaps, de&s;tined, by their ruin, to augment the general deva&s;tation. Our la&s;t re&s;ource is only the &s;welling of this tyranny to its height. That period approaches; and the people of this na|tion, finding them&s;elves oppre&s;&s;ed by a heavier yoke than they ever yet experienced, will arm them&s;elves with all their native re&s;olution, to &s;hake it off.

<P>The misfortunes, and the faults of his reign, will afford me a &s;triking le&s;&s;on all my life time. But, Wyndham, you know whether they &s;hould be attributed to him: his temper breathed indulgence and humanity: his la&s;t &s;en|timents te&s;tify his courage and greatne&s;s of &s;oul. Heaven grant that I may re&s;emble him in the&s;e virtues. I know no reproach with which his memory can be lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ded, &s;ave that of having pla|ced his confidence in per&s;ons unworthy of it, and who abu&s;ed it, both to his people's prejudice, and his own. The choice of true friends is difficult, even in private life. Is it ea&s;ier for a prince to di&s;tingui&s;h wi&s;e mini&s;ters, in the mid&s;t of &s;o many courtiers, who are intere&s;ted to impo&s;e on him by a&s;&s;umed good qualities? The more he loves his people, the le&s;s can he &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e who are round him, of being &s;trangers to the &s;ame &s;enti|ments.

The misfortune of my father, and which many kings have &s;uffered in common with him, was, to have lived long in pro&s;perity. I &s;hall have the advantage of him, in the &s;alutary experience of misfortune. Perhaps, at no other price, will heaven give me the in&s;truction that can enable me to govern wi&s;ely. I &s;hall not think that I have paid for it too dear, if I can render it conducive to the happine&s;s of the nati|on; and if I can make England forget, under a reign of ju&s;tice and of peace, the troubles which have &s;o long di&s;tracted her. I will take, for my pattern, that Henry, who&s;e name will be for ever dear to the French, and whom we our&s;elves are forced to revere. I go into his country, to col|lect the remembrance of all his virtues. Firm, like him, in adver&s;ity, I will imitate his clemen|cy, when I mount the throne. The&s;e are my engagements with my people; and do you, whom I look upon, at this moment, as repre&s;enting my people, receive the oath, which I make to re&s;pect and defend its rights, until my dying day.</P>

<P>By that pride they were undone. I am not &s;orry for it. They did not &s;erve the prince's cau&s;e &s;incerely: He had thrown him|&s;elf into their arms, and they treated him as a pri&s;oner. They removed him from the army, becau&s;e they &s;aw that he gained the affections of the &s;oldiery, by his valour. They al&s;o &s;ent home five thou&s;and brave fellows, whom they thought too &s;trongly attached to his intere&s;t. They wi&s;hed to have the glory of &s;ubduing Cromwell, all to them&s;elves. They had reduced him to extremity. It was all over with him, if they had continued upon the heights, as their general would have had them: but their head-&s;trong mini&s;ters &s;aid, that they had wre&s;tled with the Lord, in their prayers, that they had forced him

to grant them the victory, and to deliver the e|nemy into their hands. They came down, therefore, like madmen, into the plain, and were beaten. They de&s;erved it, for their blindne&s;s.

<P>No, Madam, be under no unea&s;ine&s;s, you will not &s;ee me blu&s;h: this is not the fir&s;t time that Chance has con|demned me to &s;trange metamorpho&s;es. Forced as I was a few days ago to ply the axe as a wood|cutter in the fore&s;t, why &s;hould I be a&s;toni&s;hed at this new di&s;gui&s;e? It is but another in&s;tance of the incon&s;tancy of Fortune. The more &s;he loads me with in&s;ults, the more pride I take in de&s;pi&s;ing them. I wi&s;h even to ri&s;e above her, above my&s;elf, from the low e&s;tate to which &s;he reduces me. A king, in this dre&s;s, receives an important le&s;&s;on from Providence to tran&s;mit to other &s;overeigns.</P>

<P>Lord Derby, in the&s;e garments you &s;ee nothing but what is abject; I can look upon it as the apparel of triumph. The diadem upon my forehead could not, perhaps, impre&s;s my enemies with re&s;pect, whereas, in the livery of

<P>This is homage that rai&s;es me far higher than the thrones of the earth: but ri&s;e, my friends; your place is not at my feet, but by my &s;ide. My lord, I have &s;een virtues in your hou&s;e which do not always accompany a crown, and which eclip&s;e its &s;plen|dor. If my love for my people and the laws of honour did not make it my duty to &s;upport my crown, this peaceful retreat, and the enjoyment of your friend&s;hip, would be the utmo&s;t bound of my ambition.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Sir! animated as we are with a deep concern for the intere&s;ts of our country, whatever per&s;onally regards us alone is but a very feeble con&s;ideration. It is neither my own &s;afety
<PB N="272" REF="045437_0270_102000861B8B9AF0">

<P>While I labour to obtain that great object, I &s;hall ever recollect that you have fur|ni&s;hed me with the means. If I arrive at the accompli&s;hment of it, you &s;hall not a&s;k the com|monwealth for your reward; I will charge my|&s;elf with acquitting the national gratitude.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me &s;ee my country happy, and I &s;hall be &s;ufficiently rewarded: but, alas! my &s;trength, exhau&s;ted by long &s;ervices, hardly al|lows me that hope: I leave it, however, as a be|que&s;t to my &s;on, together with the inheritance of my principles. Permit me, Sire, to recommend this my only remaining &s;on, to your notice. I a&s;k nothing for him, but that your maje&s;ty would employ him u&s;efully in the &s;ervice of his coun|try. I dare an&s;wer for him, that he will neither di&s;grace your choice, nor impair the honour of his ance&s;tors.</P>

Pity my &s;or|rows, therefore, in your turn. You think me in&s;en&s;ible, becau&s;e I would comfort you. Ah! why cannot I lay bare my heart before you?

his face, and conducted him, in an old tat|tered di&s;gui&s;e, to cut wood in the fore&s;t. They made him lie in a little chapel, upon a &s;traw bed, with a wretched bol&s;ter. A woman, whom they were obliged to admit into the &s;ecret, brought him milk, butter and eggs. The king was &s;ur|prized at &s;eeing her, and not knowing whether the Penderels had tru&s;ted her without re&s;erve, he a&s;ked her, in order to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf, how &s;he could think of being faithful to one of the king's party. The woman an&s;wered, without explain|ing her&s;elf further, that &s;he would be faithful to the king as long as &s;he lived. She uttered the&s;e words with &s;uch an appearance of feeling, that Charles' apprehen&s;ions were perfectly quieted, and he made a very hearty meal of the victuals which &s;he had brought him, nece&s;&s;ity rendering it, perhaps, the mo&s;t delicious that ever he made in his life. Charles had &s;carcely left Witlade, before &s;ome of Cromwell's &s;oldiers alighted at the mona&s;tery, and &s;earched it all through. Luck|ily a very abundant &s;hower of rain hindered them from leaving it, to &s;cour the neighbourhood; and nothing di&s;turbed the little repo&s;e, which ex|ce&s;&s;ive wearine&s;s, and violent anxiety, &s;uffered the king to enjoy in his di&s;mal lodging.</P>
<P>Informed of this alarm, the next morning, as &s;oon as he awoke, he re&s;olved immediately to go into Wales. He promi&s;ed him&s;elf more &s;ecurity there, until he &s;hould be able to make for Lon|don, whither he had &s;ent Lord Wilmot, to wait his coming. He &s;at out, therefore, at night, with one of the Penderels for his guide. As they pa&s;&s;ed near a mill, the miller hearing them
<PB N="310" REF="045437_0308_102000D7293F72C0">
open a gate at the end of the bridge that cro&s;&s;ed his mill-race, &s;allied out ha&s;tily from his mill, and demanded, with a threatening tone, where they were going, at &s;uch an un&s;ea&s;onable hour. They continued endeavouring to open the gate, without an&s;wering him. The miller ran to|wards them, crying out to them to &s;top, at which &s;ummons Penderel abandoned the bridge, and ru&s;hed into the &s;tream: the king followed him, without he&s;itation, the noi&s;e that he made in the water directing his &s;teps, as the darkne&s;s prevented him from &s;eeing his guide. Luckily the &s;ame darkne&s;s, together with the miller's cor|pulence, hindered him from overtaking them.</P>
<P>They arrived, quite wet, at the hou&s;e of a country-man, named Wolf, an acquaintance of Penderels. Wolf, after having concealed the king as well as he could, went him&s;elf to the edge of the river, to prepare a pa&s;&s;age for him; but he found the whole bank &s;o covered with &s;ol|diers, that he thought it his duty to di&s;&s;uade his gue&s;t from &s;o dangerous an enterprize. Charles was obliged to return to Bo&s;cobel, and from thence to the chapel, where he kept him&s;elf con|cealed, while the Penderels examined the coun|try, to di&s;cover whether there were any of the parliament's troops in the neighbourhood. One of them, as he went his rounds, met a per&s;on, at the &s;ight of whom the king was agreeably &s;ur|prized. His name was Carele&s;s, one of tho&s;e brave warriors, who, in order to let the king gain a larger di&s;tance from Worce&s;ter, had &s;temmed every effort of the enemy for a con&s;iderable time, at the city gates. Carele&s;s was a native of this
<PB N="311" REF="045437_0309_102000D8B7729480">
part of the country, and knew the Penderels, who brought him home to their hou&s;e. The king having hurt his foot, came hither at night to have it dre&s;&s;ed. Carele&s;s knew him, and would not quit him afterwards. He re-conduct|ed him to the fore&s;t before break of day, and made him climb into a large tree, where they both remained concealed among the thick bran|ches, for near four and twenty hours. They &s;aw &s;everal &s;oldiers walk by at the foot of the tree, many of whom expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire of &s;eizing the king. This tree received the name of the royal oak, and has ever &s;ince been honoured with the highe&s;t veneration by the people of the country.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, a &s;ecret report had been &s;pread, that Charles was &s;omewhere thereabout. One of the Penderels going into a neighbouring vil|lage, found there a number of &s;oldiers very bu&s;i|ly engaged in collecting every account po&s;&s;ible concerning the king. The officer, who com|manded them, put many que&s;tions to Penderel him&s;elf, and promi&s;ed him a great reward if he would give information where Charles lay con|cealed. Penderel did not &s;werve from his loyal|ty; but his account of this circum&s;tance, indu|ced the king to take the re&s;olution of &s;eeking a|nother retreat.</P>
<P>The guide, whom he had &s;ent with Lord Wilmot, to conduct him to London, returning, informed the king, that his lord&s;hip, de&s;pairing to reach town, through the crouds of &s;oldiers, who filled all the roads, had &s;topped &s;hort at the hou&s;e of a gentleman of the royal party, named
<PB N="312" REF="045437_0310_102000DB357787D0">
Witgrave, where he was in &s;afety. Charles con|ceived the de&s;ign of going to him, and had the good fortune to &s;ucceed, in &s;pite of every dan|ger that he was to encounter.</P>
<P>Charles, while he indulged the &s;atisfaction that he felt on &s;eeing Lord Wilmot, had not time to deliberate with him on the cour&s;e or mea&s;ures which would be mo&s;t proper for them to take, when a party of &s;oldiers appeared before Mr. Witgrave's hou&s;e, with an intention of &s;earch|ing it. Re&s;i&s;tance would have been un&s;ea&s;ona|ble. Witgrave concealed his gue&s;ts, and, at the &s;ame time, opened his door with &s;o much alacri|ty and unconcern, that his vi&s;itors were induced to make but a very &s;light &s;earch. It was &s;oon af|terwards under&s;tood, that a fre&s;h in&s;pection had been made of Witlade mona&s;tery; and that the officer of the party by whom it was &s;earched, had &s;everal times held his pi&s;tol to Farmer Pen|derel's brea&s;t, to oblige him to confe&s;s where the king was concealed.</P>
<P>The danger increa&s;ing every day, Charles dropped all thoughts of &s;taying any longer in England, and re&s;olved to get as near the &s;ea as he could, in order to embark, with more &s;peed and convenience, the fir&s;t opportunity. Colonel Lane, a zealous loyali&s;t, who lived at Bentley, a place but a few miles di&s;tant, promi&s;ed to co|operate in effecting this purpo&s;e. The king had made his feet &s;o &s;ore by walking in heavy boots, or great &s;hoes, which had not been made for him, that he was obliged to ride. He reached Bently, in company with Lord Wilmot, and the four Penderels, who had always been &s;o faithful
<PB N="313" REF="045437_0311_102000DEA2A90818">
to him. Colonel Lane propo&s;ed to convey the king to Bri&s;tol, where they might hope to find &s;ome ve&s;&s;el that would take him on board. This officer had a relation, called Mrs. Norton, who lived about three miles from Bri&s;tol, and was then very far advanced in her pregnancy. He obtained a pa&s;&s;port (without which, it was im|po&s;&s;ible to travel in tho&s;e trouble&s;ome times) for his &s;i&s;ter and a &s;ervant, under pretence of vi&s;iting his relation in the neighbourhood of Bri&s;tol. The king, therefore, &s;at off on hor&s;eback, and rode behind Mi&s;s Lane's chai&s;e, pa&s;&s;ing for her &s;ervant. Lord Wilmot leading a brace of &s;pa|niels, coupled together, and carrying a hawk upon his wri&s;t, pa&s;&s;ed for a &s;porting country gen|tleman of their acquaintance, who had met them on the road.</P>
<P>During this journey, which la&s;ted but three days, the king met with &s;everal adventures, mo&s;t of them &s;ufficient to in&s;pire him with well-grounded terrors. He had only travelled &s;ix miles, when his hor&s;e having dropped a &s;hoe, he went him&s;elf to the neare&s;t black&s;mith, to have him &s;hod, as he cho&s;e to go through with the character that he had a&s;&s;umed. While he &s;tood by at the operation, the &s;mith a&s;ked him what news were going, and if the king was ta|ken. Charles an&s;wered, without changing countenance, that he had not heard any thing of it, and that, in all likelihood, his maje&s;ty was gone back to Scotland. I do not think &s;o, re|plied the &s;mith; I &s;hould rather &s;uppo&s;e him to be concealed in England. Wherever he is, I &s;hould wi&s;h to know his place of concealment.

The parliament has publi&s;hed a proclamation, offering a reward of 1000<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling, to whoever will di&s;cover him.</P>
<P>This di&s;agreeable conver&s;ation being over, the party &s;at forward again, and continued their route to near Eve&s;ham, where, as they were about to pa&s;s a ford, they perceived, all at once, a number of hor&s;es &s;tanding, &s;addled, at the other &s;ide of it. Charles was for going right on, but his compa|ny, le&s;s re&s;olute, prevailed upon him, at length, to turn off&punc; They found them&s;elves &s;till in the view of the &s;oldiers, whom they had thought to avoid: but the prince &s;hewed &s;o good a counte|nance, and the whole cavalcade appeared &s;o much in nature, as a country family paying a vi&s;it in the neighbourhood, that the &s;oldiers, who were, at that moment, bu&s;ied in &s;eeking him, and him only, conceived not the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion of him.</P>
<P>When they came to Mrs. Norton's, Mi&s;s Lane told her, that &s;he had brought with her a young man, whom &s;he wi&s;hed her to take into her &s;ervice. He was the &s;on, &s;he &s;aid, of a poor countryman, in her neighbourhood, and had caught an ague on&punc; the road, for which rea&s;on, &s;he reque&s;ted that he might have a room to him|&s;elf. Charles retired to it, and did not &s;tir out; but a &s;ervant of the hou&s;e, who&s;e name was Pope, knew him, and, throwing him&s;elf at his feet, Is it you, Sire? &s;aid he; I have &s;een your maje&s;ty when very young, and therefore was not long recollecting you: if I can &s;erve your ma|je&s;ty, put my zeal to the te&s;t, and depend upon my fidelity. Charles was &s;urprized and embar|ra&s;&s;ed
<PB N="315" REF="045437_0313_102000E2A6ECFB28">
at this new adventure. He &s;aw an equal ri&s;k in di&s;covering him&s;elf to a &s;tranger, and in &s;hewing that he di&s;tru&s;ted a man, who had it in his power to verify his &s;u&s;picions. In this di|lemma, the apparent &s;incerity of the man, de|termined the king to conceal nothing. The e|vent proved that he was right. Pope rendered the king great &s;ervices, and contributed not a lit|tle to his &s;afety, by pointing out to him, as a &s;afe retreat, the hou&s;e of Colonel Wyndham, where, in effect, he &s;pent nineteen days, waiting until his friends &s;hould find an opportunity for him to embark on board &s;ome &s;hip.</P>
<P>This was not an ea&s;y matter, on account of the precautions taken again&s;t receiving &s;trangers. It was even dangerous to propo&s;e it, the captains of &s;hips &s;u&s;pecting every body, whom they did not know, to be the king, and dreading the pe|nalties denounced again&s;t &s;uch as &s;hould refu&s;e to di&s;cover him. A report of his death had prevailed &s;ome time, and would have contributed to render his life &s;erene, had it la&s;ted longer. He learned this, from the ringing of bells, and the public rejoicings that were made, on account of it, in the neighbourhood; but the report fell to the ground too &s;oon, and did not, in the lea&s;t, dimini&s;h the difficulties which oppo&s;ed his em|barking, notwith&s;tanding all the pains that Co|lonel Wyndham took, in order to forward this object.</P>
<P>A merchant, of the name of E&s;den, had ju&s;t conveyed Lord Barclay over &s;ea, whither he &s;led from the per&s;ecution of the parliament. Colo|nel Wyndham, who knew this merchant, went
<PB N="316" REF="045437_0314_102000E66B29FCE0">
directly to Lyme, where he lived; and entreated him to perform the &s;ame kindne&s;s for a gentle|man, a friend of his, who would de&s;ire to take no more than one &s;ervant with him in the whole. Mr. E&s;den went with him to the village of Car|mouth, where he directed him to a ma&s;ter of a &s;hip, with whom he might make his agreement. It was fixed, that the captain &s;hould come the next day but one, and receive his pa&s;&s;engers a|board, at a &s;olitary part of the coa&s;t. The king was exact to the hour of his appointment, but no &s;hip appeared. They learned, afterwards, that the preceding day, there had been a fair in Lyme, at which the parliament's proclamation, again&s;t &s;uch as &s;hould harbour or conceal the king, was read. The captain's wife being in|formed, by her hu&s;band, that he was going to convey to France, certain per&s;ons, whom he did not name to her, oppo&s;ed his de&s;ign very &s;trong|ly; and, in order to hinder him completely from effecting it, &s;he locked him up in his room, while he was bu&s;y getting ready &s;ome things ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the voyage.</P>
<P>Dreading, le&s;t this incident &s;hould become public, Charles was obliged to quit Colonel Wyndham's hou&s;e, without well knowing where to face. He proceeded, however, towards Dor|che&s;ter, accompanied &s;till by Wilmot, Colonel Wyndham, with one of his &s;ervants, being their guides. Wilmot's hor&s;e lo&s;ing a &s;hoe, the cir|cum&s;tance was very near occa&s;ioning the king's di&s;covery. They had &s;ent the hor&s;e to be &s;hod in a village where they had &s;topped, as night came on. The black&s;mith a&s;ked the ho&s;tler
<PB N="317" REF="045437_0315_102000E8E71274E8">
where his gue&s;ts came from, who an&s;wering, that, by their own account, they came from Exeter: they impo&s;e upon you, replied the &s;mith, with a countenance full of the important di&s;covery, the&s;e &s;hoes were made down in the north. The ho&s;tler, from this ob&s;ervation, recollecting that the four hor&s;emen had ordered their hor&s;es to remain &s;addled, and had not be&s;poke beds for them&s;elves, he concluded, at fir&s;t, that they were certainly people of quality belonging to the king's army, which had been defeated near Worce&s;ter; and afterwards, that it might, very po&s;&s;ibly, be the king him&s;elf. Upon the &s;trength of this conjecture, he went to the mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h, a violent parliamentarian, and communi|cated his &s;u&s;picions to him. The mini&s;ter was, at that moment, engaged in prayer, and would not be interrupted. But the noi&s;e of this ad|venture gaining ground, as the black&s;mith, on his &s;ide, had not failed to circulate it, the mini|&s;ter took fire, and went to a ju&s;tice of the peace. Immediately the whole town is up in arms, &s;earching for the &s;trangers, and a party is &s;ent off after them, by the read which they were &s;een to take. The king could not po&s;&s;ibly have e&s;|caped them, if, in&s;tead of keeping the main road, he had not turned &s;hort, and made the be&s;t of his way, by cro&s;s roads, to Sali&s;bury.</P>
<P>We cannot &s;ufficiently admire his continuing undi&s;covered during the remainder of his wan|derings. The whole country was full of troops, marching in every direction; at every &s;tep he was &s;urrounded by them. He no &s;ooner &s;topped at an inn, but the &s;oldiers, officers, whole com|panies
<PB N="318" REF="045437_0316_102000EA6F8F1450">
enter the place. Ju&s;t as he was going to &s;tep into a &s;hip, which had been prepared for him at Southampton, there came up a battalion of &s;oldiers, ordered for Jer&s;ey, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it before his face: at length, a friend contri|ved to procure him a &s;mall bark at Shoreham, in Su&s;&s;ex, upon the application of a Mr. Man&s;ell, a rich merchant of that quarter. They met at night, in a hou&s;e not far from the harbour, and Charles waited on Sir John Wilmot at table, who had kept Mr. Man&s;ell to &s;upper, and the captain of the bark, who&s;e name was Tatter|&s;hall. Supper being over, they were preparing to go aboard; and the king expected now to have no further ri&s;ks to run, except tho&s;e of the voyage, when the captain, taking the opportu|nity of his being alone with Mr. Man&s;ell, ad|dre&s;&s;ed him thus: You have deceived me, &s;aid he, and your enterprizing &s;pirit, might have co&s;t me my life. Mr. Man&s;ell, who appeared igno|rant of the matter him&s;elf, u&s;ed every effort to per&s;uade him, that the idea was without founda|tion; and at length, Sir John Wilmot, over|hearing them, came in, and plied him &s;o &s;trongly with money and promi&s;es, that he overcame his re&s;i&s;tance. Captain Tatter&s;hall ran home im|mediately; and a&s;ked his wife for linen and pro|vi&s;ions. You are in a great hurry, &s;aid &s;he, why not wait till to-morrow; and as he continued pre&s;&s;ing her to make ha&s;te; Well, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;ee it is for the king. God give you &s;ucce&s;s, and him too. The attempt is hazardous; but pro|vided you &s;ave him, I am &s;atisfied to beg my
<PB N="319" REF="045437_0317_102000EC3AA1DF58">
own and my children's bread, all my life. Ani|mated by the&s;e words, Tatter&s;hall went to give the nece&s;&s;ary orders, that his bark &s;hould be in readine&s;s to &s;ail the next morning at five o'clock. It took up the king at the appointed place; and his taking leave of his faithful friends, was a very tender &s;cene. Mr. Man&s;ell, approaching him the la&s;t, took him by the hand, and ki&s;&s;ing it with fervor, I was willing, &s;aid he, to have been deceived by your maje&s;ty: I pray God, that you may arrive in &s;afety, at your port, and return, very &s;oon, in peace, to the&s;e your realms. Charles an&s;wered him, &s;miling, that he would then remember a &s;ervice which was done him with &s;o good a grace. The bark &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of the &s;hore, and had &s;o favourable a cour&s;e the whole day, that they anchored, the &s;ame night, at Fe&s;camp, from whence the king &s;at out for Paris, and arrived there October 30, 1651.</P>

<HEAD>THE HAT.</HEAD>
<P>A COUNTRYMAN came, one day, into a &s;hop, in the city, and laying his hat on the counter, begged the ma&s;ter of the &s;hop, to lend him half a guinea upon it, as a pledge. Do you take me for a madman, &s;aid the ma&s;ter of
<PB N="320" REF="045437_0318_102000EFA8A048A8">
the &s;hop? it is again&s;t the law, and if it were not, that &s;habby hat is not worth two-pence. Such as it is, replied the countryman, I would not give it for five guineas, and yet I have very urgent oc|ca&s;ion for the &s;um that I a&s;k. I &s;old my corn at the market, a week ago, to a mealman, who was to pay me to-day; and I depended upon having it to make up my rent, which has been &s;o long due, that if it is not paid to-morrow, as I promi&s;ed it &s;hould, I expect to be di&s;trained for it. But the poor meal-man is almo&s;t broke, he has lately buried his only &s;on, a grown-up youth, and now, this la&s;t week, his wife died of grief, &s;o that I cannot be paid until next market-day. As I often come into your &s;hop, to buy things, and you know me to be an hone&s;t man, I thought you would not make much difficulty a|bout lending me half a guinea: it is nothing in your pocket, but is a great matter to me: at all hazards, there is my hat, to an&s;wer for the mo|ney, and a better &s;ecurity than you think. The trade&s;man an&s;wered him only with a &s;neer, and, turning upon his heel, attended to other per&s;ons who were in the &s;hop.</P>
<P>Sir George Liberal happened to be one of them: he had li&s;tened, with attention, to the countryman's di&s;cour&s;e, and was &s;truck with the air of hone&s;ty, that was apparent in his counte|nance. He approached him gently, and putting half a guinea into his hand, Here is the money that you want, &s;aid he, &s;ince you find people &s;o loth to oblige you, I will be your friend, without a pledge. With the&s;e words, he went out of the &s;hop, eying the ma&s;ter of it with much con|tempt;
<PB N="321" REF="045437_0319_102000F310D8AAF8">
and his carriage was gone a good di&s;|tance off, before the countryman had recovered from the emotions of his joy and amazement.</P>
<P>About a month after, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ir George Liberal was going in his chariot, up the Hay-market, he heard &s;omebody call out, &s;everal times, to his coachman, to &s;top, but to no purpo&s;e, for the coachman drove bri&s;kly on, without paying any regard to him: at the &s;ame time, Sir George looking out, &s;aw a man upon the footway, run|ning, with all &s;peed, to overtake the carriage; he, therefore, drew the &s;tring, to make the coach|man &s;top. Immediately, the man &s;prings to the coach-door, crying, I beg your pardon, Sir&mdash;I have run my&s;elf out of breath, to overtake you; Did not you, Sir, about a month ago, put half a guinea into my hand, in a &s;hop in the city?&mdash;Why, yes, I remember &s;omething of it&mdash;Well, Sir, here is the money, which I return you, with many thanks. You did not give me time to thank you then, much le&s;s to a&s;k your name and addre&s;s; and the man of the &s;hop did not know you. I came to town, every week, with my own hay and corn, in hopes that I might, &s;ome time or other, have the good fortune to meet with you: luckily, I &s;aw you as you pa&s;&s;ed up the &s;treet. I &s;hould never have been happy, if I had not had the opportunity of paying my ac|knowledgments to you; and may Heaven be|&s;tow upon you the recompen&s;e which your ge|nero&s;ity de&s;erves. I am happy, &s;aid Sir George, in having obliged &s;o hone&s;t a man as you &s;eem to be; but I confe&s;s to you, I did not expect to &s;ee the money returned me. I intended it as a

&s;mall pre&s;ent to you.&mdash;That is more than I knew, Sir; and be&s;ides, I make a con&s;cience of not receiving money that I do not earn. I had done nothing for you, and you had &s;erved me &s;ufficiently, by lending me the &s;um in que&s;tion. Let me beg you, therefore, to receive it again. No, my good friend, it belongs neither to you nor me, now: Do me the plea&s;ure to buy &s;ome|thing with it for your children, and give it to them as a pre&s;ent from me. Sir, your proceed|ing is very genteel, and it would be uncivil in me to refu&s;e your offer. Well, then, &s;ay no more, the matter is fini&s;hed. But pray explain one particular to me, which has not cea&s;ed to engage my curio&s;ity, ever &s;ince I &s;aw you: How could you have the con&s;cience to a&s;k half a gui|nea on your hat, which was &s;carcely worth a groat? Ah! Sir, it is worth every thing to me. How &s;o, pray? I will give you the hi&s;tory of it.</P>
<P>Some years &s;ince, my landlord's &s;on, &s;liding on a pool in his father's grounds, fell through the ice.

You &s;ee, Sir, if I have not rea&s;on to be fond of this hat. I never wear it in the country: every thing there reminds me of my benefactor, though he has been dead &s;ome time. My children, my wife, my cottage, my land, all &s;eem to &s;peak, as it were, continually of him to my remembrance, But whenever I come to town&punc; I always put on this hat, that I may have &s;omething about me to put me in mind of him.

<HEAD>LITTLE GRANDISON. A Letter from WILLIAM D&mdash;to his MO|THER.</HEAD>
<P>O Dear mama! every body here is in the greate&s;t con&s;ternation. Charles went out early this morning, on hor&s;eback, attended by a &s;ervant, in order to pay a vi&s;it to a friend five or &s;ix miles off and only think, he is not returned yet. His father had de&s;ired him to be home be|fore five o'clock, and it is now pa&s;t nine. Never before, did he di&s;obey the commands of his pa|rents. Something mu&s;t have happened to him. It is a very dark night, and a dreadful thick fog. Mr. Grandi&s;on has ju&s;t &s;ent off a &s;ervant, to make enquiry about his &s;on. How impatiently do I expect his return!</P>
<P>Eleven o'clock.</P>
<P>What di&s;tre&s;s! The &s;ervant is returned from the hou&s;e where Charles went to &s;pend the day. Charles had left it with his &s;ervant, before four o'clock. What can have become of him? Can he have gone a&s;tray in the fore&s;t, or fallen from his hor&s;e? Who can tell? Or have &s;ome vil|lains
<PB N="326" REF="045437_0324_102000FFE42C4100">
robbed and murdered him? Good heaven! Mrs. Grandi&s;on will die, with apprehen&s;ion. E|mily does nothing but weep. Edward is like one di&s;tracted; he runs every moment up &s;tairs, and into the yard. Mr. Grandi&s;on endeavours to comfort his wife; but it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that him&s;elf is in the deepe&s;t affliction. He has ju&s;t &s;ent out men on hor&s;eback, different ways, to en|deavour to find poor Charles. If it were not for leaving his wife in her pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s; he would, before this time, have hurried out in &s;earch of his &s;on. Oh! that I had gone with my friend! I &s;hould, at lea&s;t, have &s;hared all his dangers; but Mrs. Grandi&s;on in&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould &s;tay at home, on account of a &s;light cold. Perhaps, if I had entreated her pre&s;&s;ingly, &s;he would have &s;uffered me to go with him. I am quite unhap|py. I know not how I &s;upport my affliction. I can no longer hold the pen. I do not &s;ee what I write.</P>
<P>One o'clock in the morning.</P>
<P>No Charles yet. Not a &s;oul has gone to bed. Indeed, who could re&s;t? The &s;ervants wring their hands: Edward and Emily cry ince&s;&s;antly, O, brother! brother! and this increa&s;es my un|happine&s;s. I wi&s;h it were morning.</P>
<P>Half after &s;ix in the morning.</P>
<P>God be prai&s;ed, mama, we have news of Charles. The &s;ervant, who was with him, is ju&s;t returned. No accident has happened to my friend. It is not his fault that he cau&s;ed us &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s: he &s;taid out neither through carele&s;&s;ne&s;s nor for plea&s;ure. Far from de&s;erv|ing
<PB N="327" REF="045437_0325_1020010295FD4D90">
to be blamed, he is worthy of the highe&s;t prai&s;e. Oh! when you &s;hall hear his adven|ture! But Mr. Grandi&s;on ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ts, that we all go and lie down for a few hours, to reco|ver our&s;elves, after the fatigues and anxiety of the night; and we mu&s;t obey Farewell, ma|ma, until I awake. My fir&s;t care &s;hall be to write to you. I will ri&s;e two hours the &s;ooner, on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Nine o'clock.</P>
<P>I will now tell you the whole &s;tory, mama, from the account given us by the &s;ervant. His young ma&s;ter and him&s;elf, had &s;et out before four o'clock, as I mentioned, in order to be at home by the time that Mr. Grandi&s;on had fixed for their return. They had &s;carcely come the fourth part of the way, when it began, all at once, to grow dark. There came on &s;o thick a fog, that one could not di&s;tingui&s;h an object at the di&s;tance of two yards. Charles, who is naturally cou|rageous, did not make him&s;elf the lea&s;t unea&s;y. They held on their way, at a full trot, when &s;uddenly they perceived, &s;traight before them, a man, &s;tretched at his full length, on the road. What is here? cried Charles, &s;topping his hor&s;e. I &s;uppo&s;e, replied the &s;ervant, &s;omebody that has taken a gla&s;s too much. Let us go on, ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>No, &s;aid Charles, if it be a man in liquor, we mu&s;t remove him, at lea&s;t out of the coach way, for fear that &s;ome carriage, pa&s;&s;ing by, &s;hould go over him, in the dark. He had not &s;aid the&s;e words, before he was on the ground: but what was his &s;urprize, when approaching the unfortu|nate
<PB N="328" REF="045437_0326_10200104276914B0">
&s;tranger, he perceived him to be an old offi|cer, in regimentals. He had a large wound in his head, from which the blood flowed in abun|dance. Charles &s;poke to him, but he returned no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>It is a dead man, cried the &s;ervant, who had al&s;o alighted.</P>
<P>No, no; he is &s;till alive, &s;aid Charles. He is only in a &s;woon. Heavens! what &s;hall we do?</P>
<P>What can we do? replied the &s;ervant; we mu&s;t go on; then we can call at the fir&s;t village, and &s;end &s;omebody to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>How unfeeling you are, John, cried Charles, with vivacity; before the per&s;ons that we might be able to &s;end, &s;hould arrive here, this poor gen|tleman would be dead. See what a quantity of blood he has lo&s;t. Fa&s;ten our hor&s;es to the&s;e trees. We mu&s;t our&s;elves give him whatever a&s;&s;i&s;tance we can.</P>
<P>How, Sir? &s;aid John; &s;ure you are not &s;eri|ous. It will be dark night pre&s;ently; and we &s;hall never be able to find our way home, in this fog.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, we will &s;tay here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what will ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ay? You may gue&s;s how unea&s;y they will be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that is very true. I never thought of that.</P>
<P>Charles was going to mount his hor&s;e again, but turning his eyes, which were filled with tears, toward the officer, he felt him&s;elf held to the &s;pot by a &s;ecret power. No, unfortunate &s;oldi|er, cried he, I will not leave you in this deplora|ble
<PB N="329" REF="045437_0327_10200106AAC96650">
&s;ituation. My parents cannot be angry with me for it. I will not &s;uffer a fellow creature to peri&s;h, without doing every thing in my power to relieve him.</P>
<P>As he &s;aid the&s;e words, he took off his clothes in ha&s;te, and tore his wai&s;tcoat in two pieces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are you doing there, ma&s;ter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t bind up his forehead, to &s;top the wounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not &s;ay a word more, but come and a&s;&s;i&s;t me.</P>
<P>He then doubled his handkerchief in four folds, and bound the gentleman's head with it, which was &s;till bleeding plentifully, and taking one &s;ide of his wai&s;tcoat, folded in length, he applied it to keep the bandage on fa&s;t, with pins. Afterwards, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by John, he lifted the unfortunate &s;trang|er out of the high road, and carried him on the gra&s;s.</P>
<P>What &s;hall we do now, Sir? &s;aid John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t gallop to the fir&s;t village, and bring &s;ome people to convey this poor gen|tleman to a farm hou&s;e. I will pay them for their trouble, and, in the mean time, I &s;hall wait here for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven forbid that I &s;hould do as you &s;ay. No, Ma&s;ter Charles, I will do no &s;uch thing. What, leave you all alone in this &s;olita|ry place? Your father would never forgive me for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take the whole upon my&s;elf, and I in&s;i&s;t that you obey me.</P>

<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, &s;ince you order me &s;o po&s;i|tively, I have nothing more to &s;ay. But remem|ber at lea&s;t&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will remember every thing.</P>
<P>John &s;at off, therefore, as fa&s;t as his hor&s;e could gallop. A little farther on the road, he found a cottage, in which were two men at work, making wicker ba&s;kets, with &s;everal women and children. He opened the door, and, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the head of the family, he reque&s;ted him to come, with his elde&s;t &s;on, to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an old offi|cer, who had fallen on the road, and was welter|ing in his blood. They &s;hewed, at fir&s;t, &s;ome unwillingne&s;s to go out, on &s;uch a dark night, at the de&s;ire of a perfect &s;tranger. But, at length, per&s;uaded by the entreaties of John, and by the &s;incerity that appeared in his prote&s;tations, they went to fetch a &s;ort of bier, and then accompa|nied him.</P>
<P>During all this time, Charles had not quitted the old gentleman's &s;ide, a moment, and, by dint of care, had brought him to his &s;en&s;es again.</P>
<P>Shall I take the liberty, Sir, to a&s;k your name, &s;aid he, as &s;oon as he &s;aw him open his eyes, and by what accident you came to be in this condi|tion?</P>
<P>My name is Arthur, replied the old man, in a weak, tremulous voice. I am major in the&mdash;regiment. I had come from my own hou&s;e, intending to take a ride. My hor&s;e &s;tum|bled on the road, hereabouts, and, in his fall, threw me over his neck. My head &s;truck again&s;t a &s;tone. I endeavoured to get up, but what with pain, lo&s;s of blood, and the weakne&s;s of old age, I
<PB N="331" REF="045437_0329_1020010BF0980870">
fainted away, and cannot tell what happened to me from that moment. But you, amiable child, who &s;o feelingly compa&s;&s;ionate my misfortune, is it you, that have dre&s;&s;ed my wound, and &s;aved my life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, and I am happy to have had; it in my power to &s;erve you. I had a &s;er|vant with me: him I have &s;ent to the next vil|lage, to procure you lodging, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance more effectual than mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The major.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, have you had the courage to &s;tay by my &s;ide, in this lonely place, notwith|&s;tanding the darkne&s;s of the night! Young as you are, you have paid the mo&s;t humane atten|tion to me. What thanks do I owe you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>None, Sir. I have but done my du|ty, and &s;hall count my&s;elf happy, if I can be &s;till farther u&s;eful to you.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e was interrupted by the arrival of John, with the two men. They placed the major on the bier, on which they had, previou&s;ly, laid a good mattra&s;s: but, in &s;pite of the pains that they took to convey him gently, the &s;haking of the bier, as they walked along, revived the pain of his wound, &s;o that he fell again into a fainting fit.</P>
<P>Charles having given his hor&s;e to John to lead, walked in &s;ilence by the &s;ide of the bier, and &s;hewed every &s;ort of attention po&s;&s;ible, to the wounded per&s;on, in order to make him recover his &s;pirits. When they came to the door of the cottage, he made one of the countrymen mount his hor&s;e, and di&s;patched him, with all &s;peed, for a &s;urgeon.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="045437_0330_1020010E81B919E0">
Neverthele&s;s, John u&s;ed the mo&s;t earne&s;t per|&s;ua&s;ions to induce his young ma&s;ter to return home, and repre&s;ented to him the terrors which his parents mu&s;t feel, on account of his &s;tay.</P>
<P>What, &s;aid Charles, &s;hould I leave this old man to die in the hands of &s;trangers! You &s;ee, he is &s;till in&s;en&s;ible. I &s;hould have done nothing for him, were I to leave him now. No, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, I will &s;pend the night by his &s;ide.</P>

<P>How, Ma&s;ter Charles! You do not &s;ay &s;o?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>My re&s;olution is fixed. Do you ha&s;ten home to my father and mother; tell them every thing that has happened, that they may not be unea&s;y on my account. Tell them that I will wait their orders, here, to-morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Sir, it is what I cannot think of doing. My ma&s;ter would receive me finely, if I were to return without you.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be &s;o, for all that, replied Charles, in a firm tone of voice. Do not lo&s;e time. It is night already.</P>
<P>It was in vain that John prote&s;ted again&s;t what he called the imprudence of his young ma&s;ter: he was obliged to go.</P>
<P>Charles was ea&s;ier then, &s;uppo&s;ing that his parents would &s;oon hear of him: but there was another unlucky accident &s;till de&s;tined to befall them; the fog grew thicker and thicker, the night grew darker, and John, lo&s;ing his way in a wood through which he was to pa&s;s, and not knowing by what cour&s;e he was to get out of it, was obliged, after many ineffectual &s;campers, to &s;eat him&s;elf at the foot of a tree, and there
<PB N="333" REF="045437_0331_10200110FA5F9E68">
to wait for daylight, leaving us, all the while, in the mo&s;t terrible alarm. The poor man was quite exhau&s;ted with cold and wearine&s;s, when he came home this morning. Notwith&s;tanding his hurry to come, he was afraid to &s;hew him&s;elf, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he &s;hould be turned away. I cannot de&s;cribe to you his &s;urprize, when, after fini&s;hing his &s;to|ry, he heard Mr. Grandi&s;on cry out, How much ought I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o ble&s;s heaven for having given me &s;uch a &s;on! And you, John, have done very well, to obey his orders in every re&s;pect. Here are two guineas, to make you amends for your bad night. Go, refre&s;h your&s;elf, and take a little &s;leep, that you may be able to go back to my &s;on. I am not the lea&s;t angry with him for all the unea&s;ine&s;s that he has cau&s;ed us. He did every thing in his power to relieve us from it.</P>
<P>But how will my friend be grieved, when he learns from John what we our&s;elves have &s;uffer|ed! John is &s;et off already. I &s;aw Mr. Gran|di&s;on give him a pur&s;e of money for his &s;on, that he may have wherewithal to provide every thing nece&s;&s;ary. I am impatient now to know whe|ther the poor major be alive or dead. I hope &s;oon to be able to give you &s;ome account of him. Farewell, dear mama, continue to love me, and love al&s;o my friend Charles, for his courage, pre&s;ence of mind, and humanity.</P>
<P>Eleven o'clock.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, mama, Charles is returned. With what tran&s;port did I embrace him! He appear|ed an angel in my eyes. Thanks to his care, the major is much better. His hurt will &s;oon be cured.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="045437_0332_10200113746807E8">
Charles arrived much &s;ooner than we expect|ed. Emily was the fir&s;t who &s;aw him! She &s;creamed out with joy and &s;urprize, Charles!

<HEAD>NARRATIVE OF A SHIPWRECK.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 17th of November, 1780, I em|barked on board the St. Lawrence brigan|tine, then lying in the ba&s;on of Quebec, and bound to New-York, being charged with di&s;|patches from General Haldimand, commander in chief in that province, to Sir Henry Clinton. The &s;ame day, on receiving our &s;ailing orders, we weighed anchor, and dropped down to the harbour called Patrick's Hole, in the i&s;land of Orleans, in company with a &s;chooner bound to the &s;ame port, on board of which was an En&s;ign,

Drummond, of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">44^t^h regiment, with dupli|cates of General Haldimand's di&s;patches. In this place, we were detained &s;ix days by a contrary wind: at the expiration of which time, the fro&s;t had &s;at in with prodigious &s;everity; and the ice was forming fa&s;t in all parts of the river. Had the wind continued unfair for a few days longer, we &s;hould have been entirely blocked up by it, and had happily e&s;caped the calamities which afterward befel us.</P>
<P>On the 24th, the wind being fair, we got under way, and proceeded down the river St. Lawrence, as far as the Brandy-Pots; i&s;lands &s;o called, about forty leagues from Quebec. At this place; the wind veered about to the north|ea&s;t, which obliged us again to anchor. The weather continued inten&s;ely cold; and the ve&s;&s;el being leaky, made &s;o much water, as to render it nece&s;&s;ary to keep one pump continually going. A change of wind &s;oon after enabled us to proceed on our voyage, and to make the i&s;land of Anti|co&s;te, which is at the mouth of the river St. Law|rence; when the wind coming round again to the ea&s;tward, we were obliged to beat off and on, between this i&s;land and Cape Roziere for four days; our ve&s;&s;el at the &s;ame time increa&s;ing her leaks to &s;uch a degree, that we were under the nece&s;&s;ity of rigging the other pump, and of keeping them both con&s;tantly at work. Being now in a higher latitude, the &s;everity of the cold had increa&s;ed in proportion, and the ice began to form &s;o fa&s;t about the &s;hip, as to alarm us ex|ceedingly, le&s;t we &s;hould be entirely &s;urrounded
<PB N="7" REF="045437_0339_1020012710075138">
by it; which we only prevented, by cutting and breaking va&s;t quantities of the ice from her &s;ides. To this ta&s;k, with that of keeping the pumps at work, the crew, together with the pa&s;&s;engers, were &s;carcely equal; only nineteen per&s;ons being on board, of whom &s;ix were pa&s;&s;engers, and the remainder very indifferent &s;eamen. As for the ma&s;ter, from whom, in the pre&s;ent emergency we might have expected &s;ome degree of exertion, in&s;tead of attending to his duty, and the pre&s;er|vation of his &s;hip, he remained continually in a &s;tate of intoxication in his cabin.</P>
<P>On the 29^t^h the wind came round to the north-we&s;t, and we proceeded down the gulf of St. Lawrence, with two feet water in the &s;hip's hold. The wind kept gradually increa&s;ing till the 1^&s;^t of December, when it blew a perfect gale from the north-we&s;t quarter; and the &s;hip's crew being now almo&s;t overcome with cold and fatigue, &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of gaining upon the leak, the water having already in|crea&s;ed to four feet in the hold, nor a po&s;&s;ibility of making any port, they came to the re&s;olution of working no longer at the pumps; which was unanimou&s;ly agreed to, by all the forema&s;t-men. They accordingly left off working, and declared them&s;elves quite indifferent about their fate; preferring the alternative, of going to the bottom together with the ve&s;&s;el, to that of &s;uffering &s;uch &s;evere and ince&s;&s;ant labour in &s;o de&s;perate a &s;ituation. Their fatigues, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, from the 17^t^h of November had been exce&s;&s;ive: and though hope might &s;till remain, yet our
<PB N="8" REF="045437_0340_102001289A385B48">
pre&s;ent circum&s;tances were &s;uch, as to exclude at lea&s;t all probability of &s;aving the ve&s;&s;el. How|ever, by the force of per&s;ua&s;ion and promi&s;es, together with the timely di&s;tribution of a pint of wine per man, which I had fortunately brought on board, they were diverted from this de&s;perate re&s;olution; but with great reluctance, &s;aying, with &s;ome truth, as we afterwards experienced, and with more than they them&s;elves were aware of, that whether the ve&s;&s;el filled or not, was a matter of no con&s;equence. This delay, though not exceeding a quarter of an hour, had increa&s;ed the depth of water another foot; but the men added to their exertions, being encouraged by the wine, which was i&s;&s;ued to them every half-hour, &s;ucceeded &s;o far, as to reduce the water in the &s;pace of two hours, to le&s;s than three feet. The&punc; captain &s;till remained in his cabin.</P>
<P>During the 2d and 3d of December, the gale &s;eemed to increa&s;e rather than dimini&s;h. The ice formed &s;o thick on the &s;hip's &s;ides, as to im|pede her way very much through the water; which furni&s;hed us with a new labour, that of cutting it off, as fa&s;t as it formed, with &s;aws and axes. The leak continued to gain ground. The &s;chooner that was in company, far from being able to afford us any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, was in as leaky a condition as our own ve&s;&s;el, having &s;truck upon &s;ome rocks at the i&s;land of Coudres, through the ignorance or neglect of her pilot. A heavy &s;now beginning to fall, it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty we could get &s;ight of each other, though at no great di&s;tance, and,
<PB N="9" REF="045437_0341_1020012A26CD9BE8">
in order not to part company, fired every half-hour. The &s;chooner, at length, made no an&s;wer to our guns; whence, we concluded, &s;he had foundered; nor were we wrong in our &s;uppo|&s;ition. There were &s;ixteen per&s;ons on board, every one of whom peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>On the following day the gale increa&s;ed pro|digiou&s;ly, and the &s;ea began to run high, with a heavy fall of &s;now, &s;o as to prevent our &s;eeing twenty yards a-head of the ve&s;&s;el. The men being exce&s;&s;ively fatigued, the water had ri&s;en to its u&s;ual quantity, of between four and five feet. The mate, whom I have not yet taken notice of, an intelligent young man, and well acquainted with his profe&s;&s;ion, judged, from the di&s;tance we had run, that we could not now be far from the Magdalen I&s;lands, which lie about mid-way in the gulf of St. Lawrence. The&s;e i&s;lands are nothing more than a clu&s;ter of rocks, &s;ome ap|pearing above, and others hidden under the water, and have been fatal to many ve&s;&s;els. Seamen wi&s;h often to make them in fine weather, as they &s;erve to take a new departure from; but in foggy or blowing weather they, as &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid them. The mate's conjecture was but too well founded; for in le&s;s than two hours, we heard the &s;ea breaking upon the rocks; and &s;oon after di&s;covered the principal i&s;land, called the Deadman, clo&s;e under our lee; the point of which, it was with the greate&s;t difficulty that we weathered. Having happily cleared the main i&s;land, we were &s;till far from thinking our&s;elves &s;ecure; for being unable, on account of the
<PB N="10" REF="045437_0342_1020012EB2815A10">
heavy fall of &s;now, to &s;ee many yards a-head of the ve&s;&s;el, and, being in the mid&s;t of the &s;mall i&s;lands, there appeared very little probability that we &s;hould pa&s;s clear of them all in the &s;ame man|ner. Not being able to di&s;tingui&s;h any one, in time to avoid it, we were obliged to leave the ve&s;&s;el to the direction of Providence, and fortunately, I might &s;ay almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly, ran through them all, without damage. The anxiety and per|turbation of mind that the crew and pa&s;&s;engers were in, while in the mid&s;t of the&s;e rocks, may be ea&s;ily conceived: and now, that the danger was over, it turned out to be a fortunate occur|rence for us; for, by this time, the &s;ailors being ready to &s;ink under the accumulated di&s;tre&s;&s;es of cold and fatigue, and depre&s;&s;ed by the little hopes they had of &s;aving the ve&s;&s;el, had nearly deter|mined, a &s;econd time, to quit the pumps; and leave the ve&s;&s;el to her fate: when acquiring fre&s;h &s;pirits from the danger we had e&s;caped, and, as the vulgar are generally inclined to &s;uper&s;tition, attributing what was perhaps accident alone, to the immediate interpo&s;ition of Providence, they agreed to continue their efforts a little longer; towards which, they were likewi&s;e not a little encouraged, by the wine which I di&s;tributed to them occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P>During the night, the gale continuing, and the &s;ea running very high, we were apprehen&s;ive of being what &s;eamen call pooped, or having the &s;tern or poop of the ve&s;&s;el beaten in by the waves; which happened in fact as we appre|hended: for about five in the morning of the
<PB N="11" REF="045437_0343_10200130408D6738">
5^t^h, a large wave broke on the &s;hip's quarter, which &s;tove in our dead-lights, filled the cabin, and wa&s;hed the ma&s;ter out of his bed, where he had remained ever &s;ince the commencement of the gale. This accident, was attended with wor&s;e con&s;equences than we at fir&s;t imagined; for we &s;oon di&s;covered, from the increa&s;e of the leaks, that the &s;tern-po&s;t had been &s;tarted by the impul&s;e of the &s;ea. Having nothing in the after-hold, no other re&s;ource was left but that of at|tempting to &s;top the leaks with beef, which we cut into &s;mall pieces for that purpo&s;e: but this expedient we &s;oon found ineffectual, and the water continued to gain on us fa&s;ter than ever. The &s;ailors finding all their labours fruitle&s;s, and the leak, which was con&s;tantly increa&s;ing be|fore, now rendered by our late misfortune en|tirely irreparable, abandoned them&s;elves totally to de&s;pair; and again refu&s;ed to work at the pumps any longer. They had not however long remained inactive, before we contrived once more to per&s;uade them, to make another effort to clear the ve&s;&s;el; when, to our great &s;urpri&s;e and con&s;ternation, we found the pumps &s;o hard frozen, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to move them.</P>
<P>All endeavours now to keep the &s;hip clear were ineffectual, &s;o that in a very &s;hort time &s;he filled to the water's edge. Having no longer, as we imagined, the &s;malle&s;t foundation for hope, we re&s;igned our&s;elves, with as much fortitude as po&s;&s;ible, to our fate, which we expected every moment, to be that of going to the bottom. Notwith&s;tanding, when the ve&s;&s;el was quite full,
<PB N="12" REF="045437_0344_10200132B60B3480">
we ob&s;erved &s;he was very little deeper in the wa|ter than before; and, then recollecting a circum|&s;tance, which the trouble and confu&s;ion we had been in had almo&s;t obliterated, namely, that we had a quantity of lumber on board, imme|diately accounted for the phenomenon of her not &s;inking beyond a certain depth in the water; and began to recall hopes of &s;aving our lives, at lea&s;t, if we could but prevent her from over&s;et|ting, till we could make the i&s;land of St. Johns, or &s;ome other i&s;lands in the gulph. Having no guns on deck, (and not much lumber) to render the &s;hip top-heavy, we contrived to prevent her from over&s;etting, by &s;teering directly before the wind; though not without &s;ome difficulty, as, from the little way &s;he made through the water, the waves frequently wa&s;hed clear over the decks. Be&s;ides taking care to keep the ve&s;&s;el &s;teady, we u&s;ed every precaution, to &s;ecure our boat from being wa&s;hed overboard, the lo&s;s of which would, in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, be a dreadful mis|fortune. The cabin, being rai&s;ed above the level of the main deck, was tolerably clear of water, and afforded us &s;ome little &s;helter from the &s;everity of the weather. Thither we re|tired, leaving only one man upon deck to govern the helm, who was fa&s;tened by a rope, to pre|vent his being carried away by the waves, which, at times made a free pa&s;&s;age over us.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="045437_0345_10200134455AD598">
The gale &s;till continued, without remi&s;&s;ion, the &s;now falling &s;o thick, at the &s;ame time, as to prevent our &s;eeing to the ma&s;t-head. We knew, from the di&s;tance we had run, that we could not be far from land. The captain imagined, from our cour&s;e, during the night, and &s;ince the &s;hip filled in the morning, that we mu&s;t be near the i&s;land of St. John's, which lies between the Mag|dalen i&s;lands, and the Gut of Can&s;o. This gave us hopes of &s;aving our lives, in ca&s;e we could run a&s;hore on &s;ome &s;andy part of it, till they were da&s;hed, by the further information we had from he captain, that the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, was nothing but a continued reef of rocks, from one end to the other, and that there was but one harbour where &s;hips could put in, which he recollected, was on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the i&s;land. In a few hours after, we ob&s;erved the waves grew &s;horter and break higher, which is always found to be the ca&s;e on approaching the &s;hore; and likewi&s;e, a number of gulls and ducks flying about, a further &s;ign we could not be far di&s;tant from it.</P>
<P>We now concluded that we were about to run upon the rocks, which, the captain informed us, &s;kirted the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, and on approaching the land, laboured under greater dread and apprehen&s;ion, than amid&s;t all the dan|gers we had before experienced, the idea of be|ing ca&s;t upon tho&s;e tremendous rocks, being more terrifying than that of being buried, as our companions were, in the bo&s;om of the ocean. The &s;hip had &s;till made con&s;iderable way through the water, though full, and with no other &s;ail
<PB N="14" REF="045437_0346_10200137DAB96E40">
&s;et, but a clo&s;e-reefed fore-top-&s;ail, which was the only one we could di&s;play; and the canva&s;s being new, it had hitherto &s;tood the gale. The captain propo&s;ed bringing the &s;hip too, to keep her off the land; which I oppo&s;ed, as well as the mate, urging the probability that, we &s;hould over&s;et her in the attempt; and that moreover, &s;hould we be able to effect it, &s;he mu&s;t, after all, drive a&s;hore, as in her pre&s;ent &s;tate, it was im|po&s;&s;ible to make any way to windward. Our opinion, however, was rejected, and an attempt was made to brace about the fore-yard; but it was found impracticable, the ropes and blocks being covered with ice. We were, therefore, obliged to let it remain as before; and the wa|ter having &s;uddenly changed its colour, we ex|pected the &s;hip to &s;trike every in&s;tant. Small as our expectations were of &s;aving our lives, I thought it incumbent on me, to take every pre|caution to &s;ave the di&s;patches I was charged with, and therefore ordered my &s;ervant to open my trunks, and collect all the letters they contained, which I put into a handkerchief, and fa&s;tened a|bout my wai&s;t. He, at the &s;ame time, offered me the money he found in them, to the amount of one hundred and eighty guineas, which I de|&s;ired him to di&s;po&s;e of as he thought proper, thinking it, in the pre&s;ent emergency, rather an incumbrance, than a matter worthy of pre&s;erva|tion. My &s;ervant, however, thought otherwi&s;e, and took care to &s;ecure the ca&s;h, which was, af|terwards, of more &s;ervice to us, than at that time I could po&s;&s;ibly have imagined.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="045437_0347_1020013B5EEE80B8">
The weather continued thick, as u&s;ual, till a|bout one o'clock, when &s;uddenly clearing up, we di&s;covered the land, at about three leagues di&s;|tance. This &s;ight gave us no &s;mall &s;atisfaction, taking it, at fir&s;t, to be the i&s;land of St. John's, which, being inhabited by &s;everal French and Engli&s;h families, we might have expected &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from them; but, on a nearer view, found, from the plans we had on board, that it had not the lea&s;t appearance of that i&s;land, there being no &s;uch mountains and precipices laid down, as we di&s;covered. On drawing nigher, we ob&s;erved the &s;ea break high, and have a very di&s;mal appearance, about three miles from the land. As it was nece&s;&s;ary for us to pa&s;s through tho&s;e breakers, ere we could gain the &s;hore, we expected that our fate would be determined there; but, contrary to our expectations, there was a con&s;iderable depth of water, &s;o that we went over the reef without touching, though not without &s;hipping many heavy &s;eas, which, had not the ve&s;&s;el's timbers been &s;trong, and her loading light, mu&s;t infallibly have da&s;hed her to pieces. The land now began to have a dread|ful appearance, &s;eeming, at the di&s;tance we were off, to be high and rocky; but, on approaching within a mile of it, we had the plea&s;ure of de|&s;crying a fine &s;andy beach, and a bold &s;hore. The &s;ea ran high, but not to &s;uch a degree as on the reef we had already pa&s;&s;ed. As we advan|ced, the water continued to have a depth beyond our mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes, &s;o as to allow us to come within fifty or &s;ixty yards of the beach be|fore we &s;truck. Now was the time for every
<PB N="16" REF="045437_0348_1020013CE84FA038">
man's apprehen&s;ions to be on the rack, as we might expect, on touching the &s;hore, that the &s;hip would go to pieces. At length &s;he ground|ed, with a violent concu&s;&s;ion. On the fir&s;t &s;troke the main-ma&s;t went out of the &s;tep, and on the &s;econd, the fore-ma&s;t; but neither of them fell over the &s;ide, the deal boards in the hold being &s;towed &s;o clo&s;e together that the ma&s;ts had no room to play below; at the &s;ame time the rud|der was un&s;hipped, with &s;uch violence, as to be near killing one of the &s;ailors. As &s;oon as the &s;hip had grounded, the &s;ea began to beat over her in every part, each wave lifting her four or five feet nearer the &s;hore. In a &s;hort &s;pace of time the &s;tern was beat in by the &s;ea; and then, having no &s;helter in the cabin, we were obliged to go upon deck, and hang by the &s;hrouds, le&s;t we &s;hould be wa&s;hed overboard. In this un|comfortable &s;ituation we remained, till the ve&s;&s;el was beat &s;o high by the waves, that we could venture to walk upon deck. We now perceived that the &s;hip's keel was broken, which we ima|gined would occa&s;ion her to go to pieces: this, however, did not happen for the pre&s;ent; which I can only attribute to the boards in the hold being &s;o interwoven with each other, and frozen together by the ice, as to give a degree of &s;oli|dity to the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t care now was to get out the boat; which was not be accompli&s;hed, without difficul|ty, on account of the quantity of ice that was in and about it, and our reduction in number of effective hands by the intoxication of &s;everal of the crew, who had thought that the mo&s;t effec|tual
<PB N="17" REF="045437_0349_1020013F62F2BB48">
method of getting rid of the apprehen&s;ions they laboured under. Our ve&s;&s;el had, from the violence of the waves da&s;hing again&s;t her, broach|ed too, with her broad&s;ide to the wind, &s;o that afforded &s;ome &s;helter for the boat to the leeward. Having, with much labour, cleared the boat of ice, and prepared her for launching, I ordered &s;ome liquor to be di&s;tributed to tho&s;e who were yet &s;ober, and then a&s;ked, if any were willing to embark with me in the boat, and make the at|tempt to gain the &s;hore. The &s;ea running &s;o high, that it appeared &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for the boat to live in it for a minute, very few were willing to make an experiment &s;o full of ri&s;k; &s;o that all who offered them&s;elves, were, the mate and two &s;ailors, together with my &s;ervant, and a boy, who was a pa&s;&s;enger on board. What gave us the greate&s;t embarra&s;&s;ment in this under|taking, was, the &s;urf which broke over us every moment, and the inten&s;ene&s;s of the cold, which froze every drop of water immediately, &s;o as to cover our clothes with a &s;heet of ice. At length we got the boat into the water, and having thrown into it an axe and a &s;aw, I leaped in, followed by my &s;ervant and the mate. The boy followed us, but not &s;pringing far enough, fell into the water: he did not, however, &s;ink im|mediately; and we contrived to drag him into the boat, but not without difficulty; our fingers being &s;o benumbed with the cold, that we had &s;carcely the power of u&s;ing them: and this ac|cident was, in the i&s;&s;ue, by the chill it gave him. of fatal con&s;equence to the unfortunate youth. The two &s;ailors, who had agreed to go with us,
<PB N="18" REF="045437_0350_1020014324D31FC0">
next leaped into the boat; and all the re&s;t &s;eem|ed ready, notwith&s;tanding their former he&s;itation, to follow the example, when I found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hove her off from the &s;hip's &s;ide; for, being very &s;mall, &s;he certainly would have &s;unk, had &s;o many per&s;ons crowded in together. The &s;hip was lying about forty yards from the &s;hore; but, before we got half-way to it, we were over|taken by a wave that almo&s;t filled the boat, and the next drove us on the dry &s;and.</P>
<P>To find our&s;elves once more &s;afe upon the land, gave us no &s;mall &s;atisfaction, though in &s;o de&s;titute a &s;tate: the joy at having e&s;caped tho&s;e dangers, which &s;o long had been the chief objects of our dread, made us, for a few moments, for|get that we were &s;natched from them, merely to be expo&s;ed to others more inevitable; that we had e&s;caped one &s;pecies of death, probably to undergo another, more lingering and painful. What mo&s;t affected us, was, the di&s;tre&s;s of our companions, whom we had left on board, who&s;e lamentations, and cries for help, we could hear very di&s;tinctly. But it was impo&s;&s;ible for us, however anxious, to afford them any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Our boat being beat high upon the &s;and, could now be of no u&s;e, either to us or to them, while the &s;ea was running to &s;uch a degree, that it was not in the power of a human being to relieve them.</P>
<P>The night was now approaching, and we had not long remained in this &s;ituation, ere we found our&s;elves getting &s;tiff with cold; and the gale continuing as &s;evere as ever, we were obliged to made, with extreme difficulty, up to our wai&s;ts
<PB N="19" REF="045437_0351_10200144AEE02AF8">
in &s;now, to the &s;helter of a thick wood, about two hundred and fifty yards from the beach. This afforded &s;ome relief from the piercing north-we&s;t wind; yet a fire was &s;till wanting, to warm our frozen limbs, and we had not where|withal to kindle one. We had, indeed, taken the precaution to put a tinder-box in the boat, but the water had rendered it totally u&s;ele&s;s. Freezing, as we &s;tood, there was nothing to be done, but to keep the blood in motion by exer|ci&s;e: I, therefore, recommended it to the men, to move about, being better acquainted with the nature of cold climates, and that of fro&s;t, than any of my companions. My advice was &s;trict|ly adhered to, for about half an hour, when the young pa&s;&s;enger, whom I have already mention|ed, being overcome with the &s;everity of the wea|ther, threw him&s;elf down, in order to &s;leep; for extreme cold always occa&s;ions a &s;leepy &s;en&s;ation, that is not ea&s;ily to be re&s;i&s;ted. I u&s;ed my ut|mo&s;t endeavours, both by per&s;ua&s;ion and force, to rou&s;e him, and make him &s;tand on his legs, but all to no purpo&s;e; &s;o I was obliged to let him pur&s;ue his inclination. After walking about for half an hour longer, during which time, I felt &s;uch a &s;trong de&s;ire to &s;leep, that I &s;hould have lain down my&s;elf, had I not been aware of the fatal con&s;equences attending it, I went to the place where the boy lay, and, putting my hand on his face, and finding it quite cold, I ob&s;erved to the mate, who was clo&s;e by, that I believed he was dead. To which the youth an&s;wered, im|mediately, that he was not yet dead, but would be &s;o very &s;hortly; and reque&s;ted I would write,
<PB N="20" REF="045437_0352_10200147306C7FE8">
if I &s;urvived, to his father, at New-York, and inform him of the circum&s;tances of his &s;on's misfortune. In about ten minutes, we found that he had expired, and, as I imagined, without any pain whatever, at lea&s;t without any acute &s;en&s;ation of it. The&s;e trivial matters would be unworthy of notice, but as they &s;erve to &s;hew the effect of inten&s;e cold on the human body, and to prove, that freezing to death, is not al|ways attended with &s;o much pain as is common|ly &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The death of the boy could not deter the re&s;t of my fellow-&s;ufferers from giving way to this drow&s;y &s;en&s;ation; and three of them lay down, in &s;pite of my repeated exhortations to the contrary. Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to keep them on their legs, I broke a branch, and, de&s;iring the mate to do the &s;ame, our employment, during the remainder of the night, was to prevent them from &s;leeping, by beating them continually with the branches. This was an exerci&s;e u&s;eful to our&s;elves, at the &s;ame time that it pre&s;erved the lives of our companions. The day-light, which we looked for with &s;uch anxious expectation, at length appeared, when I de&s;ired the men to pull down their &s;tockings, and let me examine their legs, as they ob&s;erved they had no feeling in them. As &s;oon as I ca&s;t my eyes on them, I perceived, very clearly, that they were frozen, at lea&s;t, half way up; and de&s;ired they would im|mediately rub them with &s;now, which they did for a con&s;iderable time, but to little purpo&s;e; for it was impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;tore them to their feel|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="045437_0353_10200148DFD202E8">
I then went with the mate, down to the beach, to &s;ee if we could di&s;cover any traces of the &s;hip, and our companions, whom we had left on board, and, to our great &s;urpri&s;e and &s;atisfaction, found &s;he had not yet gone to pieces, though the wind continued with unabated &s;everity. My fir&s;t &s;tudy, now, was, how to get them a&s;hore, our own &s;afety, as well as their's, depending on it. I was almo&s;t &s;tiff with cold, but found feel|ing in every part, and was therefore certain I could not be frozen. What &s;eemed greatly to facilitate the undertaking, was, that the ve&s;&s;el had, by this time, beat much nigher the &s;hore, &s;o that the di&s;tance was but very &s;mall at low water. It was high flood, when we arrived on the beach; we were therefore obliged to wait till the tide was out, when we advi&s;ed the people on board, to fa&s;ten a rope to the jib-boom, by which they might &s;wing them&s;elves, one by one, toward the &s;hore. They accordingly adopted this expedi|ent, and, by watching the motion of the &s;ea, and &s;eizing the opportunity of &s;winging them&s;elves, as the waves retired, they all got &s;afe on the land, except a carpenter, who was a pa&s;&s;enger in the ve&s;&s;el. He did not think proper to venture, in this manner, or was unable, having, the night before, made rather too free with the bottle. We were happy, however, to get &s;o many of them on &s;hore, every one of whom, a few hours be|fore, we concluded mu&s;t have peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>The captain had, fortunately, before he left the &s;hip, put &s;ome materials for &s;triking a light, in his pocket. We therefore went to work in
<PB N="22" REF="045437_0354_1020014C65363EC0">
cutting wood, and gathering the branches that lay &s;cattered upon the ground, of which we made a fire, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, and were hap|py, for &s;ome time, in hovering about it, and warming our benumbed limbs. Con&s;idering the extreme cold we had endured for &s;uch a length of time, no luxury could be equal to that of the fire; but this gratification was, like many others, to &s;everal of my companions, followed by the mo&s;t excruciating pain, as &s;oon as their frozen parts began to thaw. Several of tho&s;e who had remained all night in the ve&s;&s;el, as well as tho&s;e who came a&s;hore with me in the boat, had been frozen in different parts of their mem|bers. The di&s;tre&s;s that was now painted in the faces of the&s;e unfortunate men, from the tor|tures they underwent, was beyond expre&s;&s;ion: this I knew would be the ca&s;e, before I heard them complain; but, as there was no remedy, did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to give them any inti|mation of it.</P>
<P>When we came to examine into our numbers, I ob&s;erved that a Captain Green, a pa&s;&s;enger, was mi&s;&s;ing; and was informed, that he had fallen a&s;leep on board the ve&s;&s;el, and had been frozen to death. We were rather unea&s;y about the man who &s;till remained on board, yet had &s;ome hopes of &s;aving his life, in ca&s;e the &s;hip did not go to pieces, at the return of low water: but it being too difficult to undertake in the night, we were under the nece&s;&s;ity of waiting till the following day. This night we pa&s;&s;ed a little better than the la&s;t; yet, notwith&s;tanding we had a good fire, we found extreme inconve|niency
<PB N="23" REF="045437_0355_1020015012373158">
from the total want of covering, as well as from hunger, a new mi&s;ery, that we had hi|therto been unacquainted with. Be&s;ides which, the greate&s;t part of our number were in the mo&s;t wretched &s;tate imaginable, from the &s;ores occa&s;i|oned by the fro&s;t.</P>
<P>The next morning, as many of us as were able, went to the beach, to contrive &s;ome means to extricate the carpenter, who&s;e voice we heard on board the ve&s;&s;el. The &s;ea &s;till running with the &s;ame violence as before, we could not put out the boat to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and were, therefore, obliged to wait the return of low water, when we per&s;uaded him to come on &s;hore in the &s;ame manner as the others had done; but this he ac|compli&s;hed with much difficulty, being very weak, and frozen in different parts of his limbs. We &s;till remained without any kind of provi&s;i|ons, and began to be reduced in &s;trength, for want of nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>The 7th and 8th, the gale continued as boi&s;|terous as ever; and, in the night, between the 8th and 9th of December, the &s;hip went to pieces, from the &s;tern to the main-ma&s;t, from the extreme violence with which the &s;ea broke again&s;t her. By this part of her going to pieces, we ob|tained &s;ome provi&s;ions, which wa&s;hed on &s;hore, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> &s;ome pieces of &s;alt beef, likewi&s;e &s;ome fre&s;h meat, that hung over the &s;tern, and a quantity of onions, that the captain had on board for &s;ale. This relief was very &s;ea&s;onable, it being now the fourth day &s;ince we had eaten any kind of pro|vi&s;ion whatever. Having no uten&s;ils, we dre&s;&s;ed our meat in the be&s;t manner we could, and made
<PB N="24" REF="045437_0356_102001519BF902C0">
what we thought a mo&s;t delicious repa&s;t. The &s;en&s;e of hunger being a&s;&s;uaged, we &s;et to work in collecting all the provi&s;ions we could find &s;cat|tered upon the beach, being apprehen&s;ive that we &s;hould not &s;oon get a &s;upply from any other quarter. This done, our next care was to get our&s;elves under cover, and form &s;ome kind of &s;helter from the pier|cing bla&s;t. This ta&s;k was not an ea&s;y one, &s;o many of our company being unable to move, and of the remainder, none but the mate and my&s;elf capable of any active exertion, being all more or le&s;s bitten by the fro&s;t; and our number reduced to &s;eventeen, by the lo&s;s of two per&s;ons, as al|ready mentioned. A quantity of deals had float|ed on &s;hore from the wreck: of the&s;e we carried about two hundred and fifty into the wood, and by ten at night completed a kind of hou&s;e, about twenty feet long and ten wide; which was con|&s;tructed in the following manner. We cut two poles of the abovementioned length, and, having no nails, tied them at a proper height on the out&s;ide of two trees, at the di&s;tance of twenty feet from each other: the interval between the poles, which was equal to the breadth of the trees, &s;erved for the &s;moke of our fire to go through; the fire it&s;elf being laid in an oblong po&s;ition, extending it&s;elf nearly the whole length of the hou&s;e. Again&s;t the&s;e cro&s;s poles we placed boards with a &s;lope of about &s;ixty degrees to|wards the ground, which con&s;tituted the two principal &s;ides. The two other &s;ides were com|po&s;ed of boards placed perpendicular, the trunks of the trees being taken in, and forming part of each &s;ide, on one of the&s;e &s;ides, that looked to|ward
<PB N="25" REF="045437_0357_102001548223E9A0">
the &s;outh-ea&s;t, we left a vacancy for the entrance.</P>
<P>This bu&s;ine&s;s being over, we examined the quantity of provi&s;ions we had collected, and had the &s;atisfaction to find that we had in &s;tore, be|tween two and three hundred pounds of &s;alt beef, and a con&s;iderable &s;tock of onions. As to bread, we had none; for, when the ve&s;&s;el went to pieces, the ca&s;ks were &s;tove, and the bread lo&s;t. Economy and good management, were now highly nece&s;&s;ary, to make our little &s;tock la&s;t as long as po&s;&s;ible, it being quite uncertain when we could get any relief; and, in con&s;equence, it was determined, that each man, whether &s;ick or well, &s;hould be confined to a quarter of a pound of beef, and four onions per day, as long as the latter &s;hould la&s;t. This wretched allowance, but ju&s;t enough to keep a man from &s;tarving, was the utmo&s;t we thought it prudent to afford our&s;elves, le&s;t we &s;hould be in an uninhabited country; for as yet, we were rather uncertain on what coa&s;t we were ca&s;t away; though afterwards, on com|paring circum&s;tances, we concluded it mu&s;t be on the i&s;land of Cape Breton.</P>
<P>On the 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">^t^h of December, being the &s;ixth day after we landed, the gale abated, and gave us an opportunity to launch our boat, and get on board what remained of the ve&s;&s;el. Three of us accordingly embarked, having, with much la|bour, launched the boat, and cleared her of the &s;and and ice. As &s;oon as we got on board the wreck, we went to work at opening the hatches, and having but one axe, and the cables being fro|zen over them in a &s;olid lump of ice, it took the
<PB N="26" REF="045437_0358_1020015701D29D20">
whole day to accompli&s;h it. The next day, the weather being &s;till moderate, we went again on board, and having cleared away the remainder of the cable, we cut up part of the deck, in order to make room to get out two ca&s;ks of onions, with a &s;mall barrel of beef, containing about one hundred and twenty pounds, and three barrels of apples, &s;hipped by a Jewi&s;h merchant, of Que|bec. We like wi&s;e found a quarter ca&s;k of po|tatoes, a bottle of oil, which proved very &s;ervice|able to the men's &s;ores, another axe, a large iron pot, two camp-kettles, and about twelve pounds of tallow candles. With much difficulty we got this great &s;upply on &s;hore. On the 13th, we made it our bu&s;ine&s;s to get our provi&s;ions &s;towed away in a corner of the hut, when, on opening the apple-ca&s;ks, we found their contents, to our great &s;urpri&s;e, converted into bottles of Canadi|an bal&s;am, a more valuable commodity, to be &s;ure, than apples, but what we could gladly have exchanged, in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, for &s;omething more friendly to the &s;tomach than to the con&s;ti|tution. This di&s;appointment, as may be &s;up|po&s;ed, extorted a few hearty good wi&s;hes to|wards the Jew; yet we found, afterwards, &s;ome u&s;e for his Canadian bal&s;am, though &s;omewhat different from what he intended it &s;hould be ap|plied to.</P>
<P>The con&s;iderable &s;upply we got from on board the wreck, enabled us the next day to add four onions to our daily allowance. We went on board once more on the 14th, and cut as much of the &s;ails as po&s;&s;ible from the bow&s;prit, with part of which we covered our hut, and made it
<PB N="27" REF="045437_0359_1020015ACF2D3930">
tolerably warm and comfortable, notwith&s;tand|ing the &s;everity of the weather. By this time the &s;ores of the men, who had been fro&s;t-bitten, began to mortify, and cau&s;ed their toes, fingers, and other parts of the limbs affected, to rot off, their angui&s;h being at the &s;ame time almo&s;t into|lerable. The carpenter, who came on &s;hore after the others, had lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of his feet, and on the 14th, at night, became delirious, in which unhappy &s;tate he continued, till death relea&s;ed him the following day from his mi&s;erable exi&s;tence. We covered him with &s;now and branches of trees, having neither &s;pade nor pick|axe to dig a grave for him; nor would it have been po&s;&s;ible, if we had been provided with them, the ground being in this climate &s;o hard frozen during the winter, as to be almo&s;t impenetrable. Three days after, our &s;econd mate died in the &s;ame manner, having been delirious &s;ome hours before he expired. We felt but very little con|cern at the death of our companions, either on their account or our own: for, in the fir&s;t place, we con&s;idered it rather a happine&s;s than a mis|fortune, to be deprived of life, in our pre&s;ent wretched &s;ituation, and, in the &s;econd, becau&s;e there became the fewer mouths to con&s;ume our little &s;tock of provi&s;ions: indeed, had not &s;ome paid the debt of nature, we &s;hould in the end have been reduced to the &s;hocking nece&s;&s;ity of killing and devouring one another. Though not yet reduced to this nece&s;&s;ity, our condition was &s;o mi&s;erable, that it &s;eemed &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for any new di&s;tre&s;s to make a &s;en&s;ible addition to it. Be&s;ides the pro&s;pect of peri&s;hing, through
<PB N="28" REF="045437_0360_1020015C58369FA8">
want, in that de&s;olate place, and the pain ari&s;ing from a perpetual &s;en&s;e of hunger and cold, the agony that the greate&s;t part were in, from the &s;ores occa&s;ioned by the fro&s;t, was beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion, while their groans were almo&s;t equally di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the remainder&mdash;but what affected me more than all our other mi&s;eries, was, the quantity of vermin, proceeding from the men's &s;ores, and continually increa&s;ing, which infe&s;ted us in every part, and rendered us di&s;gu&s;ting even to our&s;elves. Several, however, who had been but &s;lightly frozen, recovered in a &s;hort time, with the lo&s;s of a few toes and fingers; no one having entirely e&s;caped the fro&s;t, but my&s;elf. On the 20th another &s;ailor died, after having been, like the others, &s;ome time in a delirium, and was buried, or rather covered, in the &s;ame man|ner. Our number was now reduced to fourteen per&s;ons; yet we did not think it prudent to in|crea&s;e the allowance of provi&s;ions, but &s;till kept it at the rate originally fixed on, of a quarter of a pound of beef <HI>per diem.</HI></P>
<P>The mate and I had frequently gone out to|gether, &s;ince we were &s;hipwrecked, to try if we could di&s;cover any traces of inhabitants, but, hi|therto, without &s;ucce&s;s. About a fortnight after we had fixed our&s;elves in the hut, we took the opportunity of a fine day to walk ten or twelve miles up a river, upon the ice, where we ob|&s;erved many tracks of moo&s;e-deer and other animals, &s;ome of which we might have killed, had we been provided with arms and ammuni|tion. In our progre&s;s up the river we di&s;cover|ed
<PB N="29" REF="045437_0361_1020015F1FA4BD10">
&s;everal trees cut on one &s;ide, as we imagined, by an axe, which gave us rea&s;on to think there might he Indians near at hand. On going up to the place, we could plainly perceive, that there had been &s;ome there lately, by their wigwam, which &s;till remained with &s;ome fre&s;h bark about it. We likewi&s;e found the &s;kin of a moo&s;e-deer hanging acro&s;s a pole. We travelled a good way further, in hopes of making &s;ome more di&s;|coveries of this nature, but to no purpo&s;e. It gave us, neverthele&s;s, &s;ome &s;atisfaction to find, that we were in a place where inhabitants had been lately, as it was probable they might again return there. In ca&s;e this &s;hould happen, I cut a long pole, and &s;tuck it in the ice, upon the river; then with my knife, which I always took care to pre&s;erve, as it was the only one among us, cut a piece of bark from a birch tree, and forming it into the &s;hape of a hand, with the fore-finger extended, and pointing toward our hut, fixed it on the top of the pole, and took away the moo&s;e-&s;kin, in order that they might perceive that &s;ome per&s;ons had been on the &s;pot &s;ince they left it, and the route they had taken on their return. We then pur&s;ued the way to our habitation, and communicated this agreeable information to our companions, who were not yet able to move about: trifling as the hopes were, which we could in rea&s;on derive from this di&s;covery, yet it gave them con&s;iderable &s;atis|faction. Twenty days being elap&s;ed &s;ince our &s;hipwreck, and our provi&s;ions being very much reduced, I began to entertain a &s;u&s;picion, that there was &s;ome foul play during my ab&s;ence at
<PB N="30" REF="045437_0362_10200160B0CF4128">
different times from the hut, in &s;earch of inha|bitants. I was therefore determined to find out the truth, if po&s;&s;ible, by keeping a con&s;tant watch at night; by which means I at length di&s;cover|ed, that the depredators were no other than the captain and two &s;ailors, who had con&s;umed no le&s;s than &s;eventy pounds, be&s;ides a quantity of onions, in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time. To prevent &s;uch unfair practices for the future, the mate and I never went out together, one of us con&s;tantly remaining in the hut.</P>
<P>We continued in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, from our la&s;t di&s;covery, for &s;ome days, when giving up, at length, all hopes of &s;eeing any Indians or inhabi|tants in this place, having provi&s;ions only for &s;ix weeks longer, and a few of our men, together with the captain, being recovered, I propo&s;ed leaving our habitation, with as many as could work in the boat, in &s;earch of inhabitants. This propo&s;al was unanimou&s;ly a&s;&s;ented to; but when we came to think how it was to be put in execution, a new difficulty &s;tarted it&s;elf, namely, that of repairing the boat, which had been beat in &s;uch a manner by the &s;ea upon the beach, that every &s;eam was open. We fir&s;t attempted to &s;top them with dry oakum, but &s;oon found that it would not an&s;wer the intended purpo&s;e, and having &s;aved no pitch from on board the wreck, we began to de&s;pair of the po&s;&s;ibility of repairing them. I, at length, thought of making a kind of &s;uccedaneum for pitch, of the Canadian bal&s;am, which, as I before mentioned, had been &s;hipped f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r apples, and had been by us brought on &s;hore under that deception. We accordingly went to
<PB N="31" REF="045437_0363_1020016516D39120">
work in making the experiment, and boiled a quantity of the bal&s;am in the iron kettle we had &s;aved, and frequently taking it off the fire to cool, we &s;oon brought it to a proper con&s;i&s;tence. A &s;ufficient quantity of it being prepared, we turned up the boat, and having cleaned her bot|tom, gave her a coat of the bal&s;am, which effec|tually &s;topped up all crevices for the pre&s;ent. This done, we got a &s;mall &s;ail rigged to a ma&s;t, which &s;hipped and un&s;hipped occa&s;ionally; and then pitched upon the per&s;ons who were to go with me in the boat.</P>
<P>By the 1&s;t of January, with much difficulty and fatigue, we got our boat in tolerable condi|tion, &s;o that &s;he could &s;wim, without making much water; likewi&s;e our ma&s;t and &s;ail rigged, in ca&s;e we &s;hould happen to get a fair wind, which we could not often expect on this coa&s;t, at the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on of the year; for, during the winter months, it blows almo&s;t con&s;tantly from we&s;t to north-we&s;t, which is immediately on the land. We could not expect, therefore, to have much occa&s;ion for our &s;ail; neverthele&s;s, it might &s;ometimes be &s;erviceable, and afford &s;ome relief to the rowers. We had agreed to take &s;ix in the boat, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the captain and mate, two &s;ailors, my&s;elf and &s;ervant: of the others, none were &s;o far recovered as to be judged equal to the fatigues we might expect in this expedition. Our &s;hoes being all nearly worn out, my em|ployment, during the whole of the next day, was, to make a kind of mowki&s;ins, or Indian &s;hoes, of canva&s;s. My needle was nothing more than the handle of a pewter &s;poon, which I had
<PB N="32" REF="045437_0364_1020016793673578">
fa&s;hioned, as well as I could, for the purpo&s;e, and the &s;ame canva&s;s &s;upplied me with thread. As &s;oon as I had made twelve pair, which was two for each man in our party, we divided the pro|vi&s;ions that remained, into fourteen equal parts, which amounted only to a quarter of a pound of beef <HI>per</HI> day, for &s;ix weeks; tho&s;e who were to &s;tay behind, &s;haring as much as we who were to go in the boat, notwith&s;tanding the great fa|tigue which we had every rea&s;on to expect. Eve|ry nece&s;&s;ary preliminary being adju&s;ted, we pro|po&s;ed &s;etting off the next day; but the wind blowing fre&s;h at north-we&s;t, were obliged to re|main where we were, till the fourth. By this time, the ice, floating in prodigious quantities on the coa&s;t, and in &s;ome places collecting, and blocking up the bays, rendered our undertaking extremely hazardous; yet we thought it more advi&s;eable, to face any danger, and to encounter any hard&s;hip, than to remain in our pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation, with a certainty of &s;tarving.</P>
<P>In the afternoon of the 4th, the wind moder|ating, we got our provi&s;ions, and whatever little matters might be of &s;ervice to us, into the boat; and, having taken leave of our companions, &s;at off on our expedition. Having got about eight miles from the place of our &s;hipwreck, the wind began to increa&s;e, and blow very hard at &s;outh|ea&s;t, which was immediately off the &s;hore. The boat, as well as the oars, being none of the be&s;t, we were on the point of being blown out to &s;ea, but by dint of rowing, made &s;hift to get in|to a deep bay, about a mile a-head, where we
<PB N="33" REF="045437_0365_102001691C7F5960">
thought we might pa&s;s the night with &s;afety. Having got every thing on &s;hore, we hauled our boat up as high as our &s;trength would permit, &s;o as to prevent the &s;ea from doing her any more damage. This done, we &s;et to work in lighting our fire, and cutting our wood for the night: we likewi&s;e cut &s;ome pine-branches, the &s;maller of which &s;erved us to lie on, and the larger, in the form of a wigwam, to &s;helter us from the inclemency of the weather.</P>
<P>The place we had landed on, was a fine &s;andy beach, with little or no &s;now on it. Having ob|&s;erved &s;ome &s;mall pieces of wood ca&s;t on &s;hore by the tide, that had formerly been cut with an axe, and a number of long poles &s;cattered along the edge of the bank, which had likewi&s;e been cut in the &s;ame manner, I thought it likely there might be &s;ome inhabitants near at hand; and propo&s;ed, as &s;oon as we had taken a little re|fre&s;hment, to go along the beach to a high point of land, at about two miles di&s;tance, which was clear of wood, and appeared to be cultivated; thinking from thence we might make &s;ome u&s;e|ful di&s;coveries. I accordingly &s;at out, &s;oon after, with two of the men; and, before we had pro|ceeded a mile, &s;aw the remains of a &s;hallop, or Newfoundland fi&s;hing-boat, almo&s;t covered with &s;and, which &s;eemed to have been &s;et on fire. This gave us hopes of di&s;covering &s;omething el&s;e to our &s;atisfaction, and we proceeded, as fa&s;t as we could, to the point of land. Having gain|ed the top of it, we de&s;cried, to our inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, a few hou&s;es, about half a mile di&s;tant, to|ward which we directed our cour&s;e, having no
<PB N="34" REF="045437_0366_1020016CC0633288">
doubt but that we &s;hould now meet with &s;ome relief; but, on coming up to them, found they were only the remains of &s;ome old &s;tore-hou&s;es, which had been built there for the curing of cod-fi&s;h; and, to all appearance, had been aban|doned &s;ome years before.</P>
<P>This was a mortifying di&s;appointment to us. We determined, however, to make the mo&s;t of our di&s;covery; and, ob&s;erving a number of old ca&s;ks lying about, in different parts, we &s;earched them, as well as the hou&s;es, very minutely, in hopes of finding &s;ome provi&s;ions; but to no purpo&s;e. As we walked along the point, we ga|thered about a quart of cranberries, &s;ome of which we are, pre&s;erving the remainder for our companions. Having reconnoitred every part of this point, without any further &s;ucce&s;s, we return|ed to our boat, and communicating the di&s;cove|ries we made to our companions, gave them their &s;hare of the berries we had gathered. Even the&s;e di&s;coveries gave us much &s;atisfaction, as they tended to confirm our hopes of finding &s;ome inhabitants in the cour&s;e of our voyage along the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the wind came round to the north-we&s;t, and blew with &s;uch violence, as to prevent us from proceeding on our voyage. It continued &s;o for two days, when, happening to get up in the middle of the night, I was a&s;to|ni&s;hed on ob&s;erving, while the wind continued blowing as hard as ever, that the &s;ea was entire|ly without agitation. I immediately awoke the mate, to inform him of this extraordinary phoe|nomenon: and going down to the beach to|gether
<PB N="35" REF="045437_0367_10202955205534D8">
to know the cau&s;e, we found the &s;ea all covered with ice, nothing but a large &s;heet of it being to be &s;een for leagues around. This was an alarming circum&s;tance, as it &s;eemed to pre|clude all po&s;&s;ibility of proceeding any farther, and might give us cau&s;e even to regret having left our habitations; for, though we were &s;o near, it was impo&s;&s;ible to return by land, be&s;ides other impediments, on account of the depth of &s;now, which was impa&s;&s;able, unle&s;s with &s;now-&s;hoes.</P>
<P>The wind continued to blow from the &s;ame quarter for two days longer; and at length, on the 9th, it became perfectly calm. Next morn|ing the wind came round to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, which was directly off the land, and in a &s;hort time blew extremely hard, &s;o that by four o'clock in the afternoon, there was not a piece of ice to be &s;een along the coa&s;t, the whole of it being blown out to &s;ea. This was a very plea&s;ing &s;ight to us, as it gave us a pro&s;pect of being extricated from our pre&s;ent dreary &s;ituation. However, the violence of the wind prevented us from mov|ing till the 11th of January, when the weather being moderate, and a fine light breeze blowing along the coa&s;t, we launched our boat with much difficulty, being greatly reduced in &s;trength, for want of a due degree of nouri&s;hment. Hav|ing got round the clear point of the land, we hoi&s;ted our &s;ail and put before the wind.</P>
<P>The weather being very moderate, and little or no &s;ea running, we made tolerable way, and had not proceeded far, before we de&s;cried an ex|tremely high point, about &s;even leagues a-head,
<PB N="36" REF="045437_0368_10202956A9235F40">
with a continued precipice along the coa&s;t, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to land on any part of it, before we came to that headland. This made it very dangerous to attempt the pa&s;&s;age; for if the wind &s;hould happen to come round to the north|we&s;t, we mu&s;t infallibly have peri&s;hed among the rocks. But danger was no longer an object to be con&s;idered by us; &s;o we got out two oars, not being able to u&s;e any more, as the boat had been &s;o much damaged, that two men were con&s;tantly employed in keeping her clear of water, and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a fair wind, made the point about eleven o'clock at night; but finding no place that we could po&s;&s;ibly land on, we were obliged to keep along the coa&s;t till two in the morning, when the wind increa&s;ing, and a &s;tony beach appearing, on which we &s;hould not have thought it expedient to land, had the wind been moderate, we were obliged to put a&s;hore, and immediately got our provi&s;ions out of the boat. The beach was of &s;ome height from the &s;urface of the water, the &s;ea having beat the gravel up into a kind of bank; which rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for us to haul our boat up. We were therefore obliged to leave her to the mercy of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The place where we landed, was a beach of about four hundred yards in length, bounded at the di&s;tance of about fifty yards from the water's edge, by a precipice of at lea&s;t one hundred feet in height, which inclo&s;ed it on all &s;ides. If the wind &s;hould come round to the north-we&s;t, we knew that we &s;hould be entirely deprived of &s;hel|ter, yet, as it blew too fre&s;h for us to attempt
<PB N="37" REF="045437_0369_102029599D045070">
putting to &s;ea again, we were obliged to remain there, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e inconveniences.</P>
<P>On the 13th the wind came round to the north-we&s;t, and blowing very hard, the &s;ea beat with &s;uch violence again&s;t the &s;hore, as to drive our boat twenty yards higher than &s;he was, and to beat &s;everal holes in her bottom. Now was the time for us to feel all the mi&s;eries of our pre&s;ent &s;ituation; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, being &s;urrounded by pre|cipices, which prevented us from &s;heltering our|&s;elves in the woods, and having &s;o little covering, and no firing, but what we collected from &s;ome pieces of timber, which floated accidentally upon the &s;hore, we could but ju&s;t keep our&s;elves from ab&s;olute freezing. The &s;ame weather continued for eight days, with a prodigious fall of &s;now, a circum&s;tance that added to our other incon|veniences. At length, on the 21&s;t, the weather became more moderate, and the &s;now cea&s;ed, having in the cour&s;e of this la&s;t week, fallen to the depth of three feet, perpendicular. This gave us an opportunity of cooking our provi&s;ions, which we had done but once, &s;ince our landing. Even this was a great lo&s;s to us, as the water that the meat was boiled in, afforded us almo&s;t as much nouri&s;hment, as the meat it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Next day we contrived, with much labour, to turn our boat half way over, in order to examine the damage &s;he had received, which we found con&s;iderable; the coat of bal&s;am being entirely rubbed off, and &s;everal holes made in her bot|tom. We expected the ice would go to &s;ea, as it had done once before, whenever the wind &s;hould come round to the &s;outhward; and
<PB N="38" REF="045437_0370_1020295C8B7CA898">
therefore thought, if we could but get our boat repaired, that we might &s;till have &s;ome chance of meeting with inhabitants. But the great difficulty was, how to repair it; for we had no pitch or bal&s;am left, and but little dry oakum, which was of no &s;ervice to us, without the form|er. After trying various methods, we at la&s;t gave it up as a thing entirely impracticable, and began to turn our thoughts toward &s;ome other means, of getting out of this bleak and barren place, to &s;earch for relief, in an uninhabited country.</P>
<P>Though it was impo&s;&s;ible for us, to climb the precipice, by which we were encompa&s;&s;ed, yet, if we were determined to abandon our boat, we imagined, that we might ea&s;ily get into the woods, by walking along &s;hore upon the ice, which &s;till covered the &s;ea, and had &s;trength &s;ufficient to bear any weight. In fact, the mate and I, propo&s;ed walking a few miles on it, in order to make the experiment. We accordingly &s;at out, and had not proceeded far, before we came to the entrance of a river, and a fine &s;andy beach, where, had our good fortune directed us to land, we might have lived more comfortably, and have pre&s;erved our boat. But what was to be done now, that we could get into the woods? We could not think of walking acro&s;s them, in &s;earch of a cultivated country: be&s;ides, that we &s;hould be entirely ignorant, how to direct our cour&s;e; the depth of &s;now, which had, by this time, increa&s;ed to &s;ix feet, in the wood, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for us to travel, without &s;now-&s;hoes. After con&s;ulting together, we at la&s;t
<PB N="39" REF="045437_0371_10202961296ED790">
came to a re&s;olution, of taking, the next day, what provi&s;ions we had, upon our backs, and coa&s;ting along the ice, till we could di&s;cover &s;ome inhabitants; expecting, from its pre&s;ent ap|pearance of &s;trength, that it would remain for &s;ome time longer: and the wind having drifted the greate&s;t part of the &s;now off it, we compu|ted that we &s;hould be able to walk about ten miles a day, even in our pre&s;ent weak and re|duced condition.</P>
<P>This being fully re&s;olved, we were to &s;et out the morning of the 24th; but on the night preceding it, the wind came round to the &s;outh|ea&s;t, and blew hard, attended with &s;now and rain; &s;o that in the morning, as I already ap|prehended would be the ca&s;e, that whole &s;heet of ice, which the night before looked &s;o firm, was demoli&s;hed, or driven out to &s;ea. Thus were all our &s;chemes fru&s;trated&mdash;neither ice to walk on, nor boat to carry us through the water; not even a po&s;&s;ibility of moving from this place, where we were embayed, and &s;ur|rounded by in&s;urmountable precipices. Thus circum&s;tanced, we were again obliged to turn our thoughts toward &s;ome &s;cheme for repairing our boat: upon that our only hope depended. We had plenty of oakum to &s;top up the holes and &s;eams, but nothing to &s;ub&s;titute in the room of pitch, to prevent the water from penetrating. I at length thought of a plan, which I imagined might have the wi&s;hed-for effect, namely, that of throwing water over the oakum, and letting it freeze into a cake of ice. As &s;oon as day ap|peared, I re&s;olved to put this &s;cheme to the te&s;t,
<PB N="40" REF="045437_0372_101FFC7D312E7FF8">
and having cleared the boat of &s;now and gravel, immediately went to work. The men in gene|ral made light of my undertaking, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted, with much reluctance, thinking that they were throwing away their labour. However, I &s;oon convinced them to the contrary&punc; for, by four o'clock in the afternoon, by continually throw|ing water over the oakum, we froze up every &s;eam and hole, in &s;uch a manner, that not a drop of water could enter, as long as the weather con|tinued freezing, as at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>On the 27th of January, the weather being moderate, and a light breeze directly off the &s;hore, we got our boat very carefully launched, and &s;at off early in the morning from this ill-omened bay. We had the plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve that the boat made little or no water, &s;o that we were enabled to keep our four oars continually at work. As we advanced along the coa&s;t, we found it &s;till bordered by nothing but barren pre|cipices, with every four or five miles perhaps a &s;mall &s;andy beach.</P>
<P>The weather continued very moderate all the day of the 27th, &s;o that, by &s;ix o'clock in the e|vening, we computed that we had rowed about twelve miles from where we departed in the morning. This indeed would be but an indif|ferent day's work for people in health and vi|gour, but a great deal for tho&s;e in our circum|&s;tances; not only being extremely weakened and reduced, but the boat it&s;elf being very heavy and unwieldy, from the quantity of ice in it. We put a&s;hore about &s;ix o'clock, upon a &s;mall &s;andy beach, and, by placing oars under our boat,
<PB N="41" REF="045437_0373_1020296418ABB450">
dragged her carefully &s;ome yards from the water, &s;o that &s;he lay very &s;afe, while the wind continu|ed as it then was. We next cut &s;ome branches, and having made a fire, &s;heltered our&s;elves, as well as po&s;&s;ible, in the wood. Our tinder being nearly con&s;umed, I was obliged to furni&s;h a fre&s;h &s;upply, by cutting away the back part of my &s;hirt, which I had worn ever &s;ince we left the &s;hip.</P>
<P>A &s;hower of rain, the next day, unfortunate|ly melted all the ice off our boat: we were, therefore, prevented from going any farther, till a return of the fro&s;t, and had the mortification to lo&s;e the benefit of a fine day, in the cour&s;e of which, we might have proceeded, with a good boat, &s;everal leagues more on our journey. What made the matter wor&s;e, was, that our provi&s;ions were now reduced to two pounds and a half of beef for each man. On the morning of the 29th, the mate having wandered a little di&s;tance from our fire, returned in ha&s;te to inform me, that he had di&s;covered a partridge perched on the bough of a tree, which he thought I might po&s;&s;i|bly devi&s;e &s;ome method of catching. I imme|diately went to the place where he had &s;een it, and found it in the &s;ame &s;ituation as before. Ob|&s;erving that the bird was very tame, and not a|bove fourteen feet from the ground, I cut down a long pole, and taking part of the rope-yarn that fa&s;tened my canva&s;s &s;hoes, made a running loop of it, and fixed it to the end of the pole; then walking &s;oftly under the tree, and lifting the pole gently up, I fixed the loop about the partridge's neck, and giving it a &s;udden jerk, clo&s;ed the loop,
<PB N="42" REF="045437_0374_10202965A3DCF820">
and &s;ecured the bird. The mate, as well as my|&s;elf, as &s;oon as I had caught it, laughed very heartily, for the fir&s;t time that either of us had any inclination to &s;mile &s;ince our &s;hipwreck. We then went toward the fire with our prize, and boiled it in &s;ome melted &s;now, together with a little &s;alt water, to give the broth a reli&s;h: hav|ing divided it, when dre&s;&s;ed, into &s;ix equal parts, and ca&s;t lots for the choice of each, we &s;at down to what we found a delicious meal; the only one, excepting the quart of cranberries, for which we were indebted to chance, or providence, &s;ince we had been ca&s;t upon the i&s;land.</P>
<P>On the afternoon of the 29th, it began to freeze hard, when we took the advantage of the fro&s;t, to &s;top the boat's leaks, as before; and the wind &s;till continuing moderate, we launched her, as &s;oon as that bu&s;ine&s;s was completed, and put to &s;ea. The day being almo&s;t &s;pent, before we &s;at off, we could not make above &s;even miles, to a &s;andy beach and thick wood, which &s;eemed to afford a tolerable &s;helter. In this place we pa&s;&s;ed the night; and the next day, the weather being &s;till favorable, we launched our boat betimes in the morning, in order to get, before night, as far as po&s;&s;ible on our journey; but we had not pro|ceeded above &s;ix miles, before the wind fre&s;hen|ing up from the &s;outh-ea&s;t, obliged us to put a|&s;hore, and haul up our boat.</P>
<P>A heavy fall of rain, which continued the whole day, rendered our &s;ituation extremely un|comfortable, and melted again the icy caulking of the boat. We were therefore to con&s;ole our|&s;elves, as well as we could, in the certainty of re|maining
<PB N="43" REF="045437_0375_10202968F0C59498">
here till the return of the fro&s;t, and mean while, propo&s;ed to reconnoitre, as far as our reduced &s;tate would allow us, into the coun|try. In this, however, we were prevented by the quantity of &s;now which &s;till lay on the ground, and was not yet &s;ufficiently frozen, to bear our weight, without rackets, or &s;now-&s;hoes. Toward the &s;pring of the year, in the&s;e cold climates, they may, for the mo&s;t part, be di&s;pen&s;ed with, when the &s;now has become more conden&s;ed by its own weight, the influence of the &s;un, and the rains, which began to fall at this &s;ea&s;on. The fro&s;t then returning, after the thaw, forms a kind of incru&s;tation on the &s;urface, that will bear a man's weight, without &s;inking. Had this &s;ea&s;on been arrived, we &s;hould have abandoned our cra|zy boat, and, taking the little provi&s;ion we &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, have made an attempt to di&s;cover in|habitants, by a march into the heart of the country; perhaps it was fortunate we could not attempt it, as in all probability, we &s;hould have peri&s;hed in the woods.</P>
<P>Not having it in our power to wander toward any other part, we walked along the &s;hore as far as we were able, and &s;aw nothing that could at|tract our notice, but &s;ome &s;tumps of trees, from which the trunks might have been cut &s;ome years before: from this circum&s;tance, we could collect no very &s;anguine hope of being near an inhabi|ted country. Soon after, the wind coming round to the north-we&s;t, and bringing the fro&s;t along with it, we were once more enabled to repair our boat, and to prepare for launching it, as &s;oon as the wind &s;hould abate its violence. This hap|pening,
<PB N="44" REF="045437_0376_1020296D5293D818">
in &s;ome degree, on the 1&s;t of February, we immediately embarked, and pur&s;ued our coa&s;ting voyage; but the &s;everity of the cold having formed a quantity of ice, it was with ex|treme labour that we contrived to get five miles before night, one of our party being employed in breaking the ice with a pole, and clearing it from the bows of the boat.</P>
<P>The following day, the wind blowing fre&s;h from the north-we&s;t quarter, prevented us again from proceeding any farther, till the 3d, when, coming round to the we&s;t, which is directly along the &s;hore, and the mo&s;t favourable that could blow for us, we were enabled to embark, and pur&s;ue our voyage. Our boat, notwith&s;tanding all our diligence in caulking, made now &s;o much water, that we were obliged to keep one man con&s;tantly at work in baling it out with a camp-kettle. The wind, however, was as fair as we could wi&s;h, and being neither too &s;lack nor too violent, we, for &s;ome time, went at the rate of four miles an hour, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our oars; but &s;oon after, the wind increa&s;ing, we laid in our oars, and ran under our &s;ail alone, at the rate of about five miles an hour.</P>
<P>After having run above &s;ixteen miles, we di&s;|covered an exceeding high land, about &s;ix leagues di&s;tant, with &s;everal other mountains and large bays between us; and, it being yet early in the day, a fine wind, and no great &s;ea, we were in hopes, if the wind &s;hould not increa&s;e too much, that we &s;hould be able to reach it before night. As we proceeded along the coa&s;t, we found it in every part high and rocky; which made us very
<PB N="45" REF="045437_0377_1020297048220800">
unea&s;y, le&s;t the wind &s;hould ri&s;e, before we could make the head-land. About two o'clock in the afternoon, when we &s;uppo&s;ed we were within three leagues of it, we di&s;covered an i&s;land about twenty miles from the main; and, on compar|ing circum&s;tances, we concluded that the i&s;land mu&s;t be that of St. Paul, and the high land, the north point of Cape Breton. The prodigious height of the land, led us into an erroneous com|putation of its di&s;tance; for, notwith&s;tanding we had &s;uppo&s;ed that we were within three leagues of it, when we fir&s;t di&s;covered the i&s;land of St. Paul, we found, before we reached it, that we had run near five leagues.</P>
<P>It was almo&s;t dark by the time we reached the North Cape; where, finding no place to land, we were obliged to double the Cape, and conti|nue our journey. The wind now began to fre&s;hen, and we had a heavy &s;ea from the north|ea&s;t to encounter, as &s;oon as we came oppo&s;ite to the Cape. After having doubled it, our cour&s;e lay in a very different direction from what it had been in the morning; &s;o that we were obliged to &s;trike our &s;ail, and take to the oars. The wind, at the &s;ame time, blew &s;o hard off the high lands, that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty we could keep along the coa&s;t: had we not been a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by a heavy &s;well, that came from the north|ea&s;t, we mu&s;t certainly have been blown out to &s;ea.</P>
<P>Finding no place to land during the night, we continued rowing as clo&s;e as we could to the rocks, till about five in the morning; when, hearing the &s;ea run on the &s;hore very long and
<PB N="46" REF="045437_0378_10202971D2BA20E0">
heavy, we imagined that we mu&s;t be off a &s;andy beach. We accordingly rowed toward the land, and, at the di&s;tance of fifty yards, for it was yet dark, were able to di&s;cern a beach at lea&s;t four miles in length. It was not, however, a conve|nient place for us to put in, on account of the &s;urf, and a long and heavy &s;ea that rolled on it; yet being &s;o much fatigued with rowing, that we were incapable of proceeding any farther, we were obliged to attempt a landing. This we ef|fected with more ea&s;e than we looked for, and &s;uffered no other inconvenience, but that of hav|ing our boat nearly filled with water on the beach. Having landed, our fir&s;t care was to haul up the boat, that &s;he might meet with no further da|mage from the &s;ea. We then got into the woods, which lay clo&s;e to the &s;hore; and, as I had taken the precaution to put our tinder-box in my bo|&s;om, before we landed, to pre&s;erve it from the water, we contrived to kindle a fire; a refre&s;h|ment we had much occa&s;ion for, having got wet in landing, and being in &s;o weak and reduced a condition, that it was with the greate&s;t difficulty we could keep our&s;elves awake for a few minutes, when before the fire; &s;o that we were under the nece&s;&s;ity of watching in turn, le&s;t, all being a&s;leep together, the fire &s;hould go out, and we &s;hould be frozen to death. Having now time to con&s;i|der every circum&s;tance, and finding, as &s;oon as day-light appeared, that the land &s;till continued to have an oppo&s;ite bearing to that on the other &s;ide of the point, we had no doubt remaining, but that we were upon the north cape of the i&s;land of Breton, which, together with Cape
<PB N="47" REF="045437_0379_10202974B9AB0020">
Roy, on the i&s;land of Newfoundland, marks the entrance of the gulph of St. Lawrence.</P>
<P>Our provi&s;ions were now entirely con&s;umed, and having not the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of get|ting any more, we were ready to abandon our|&s;elves to de&s;pair. As we were certain of being on an inhabited i&s;land, we might have flattered our&s;elves with the hopes of getting relief, by per&s;evering in our dilatory progre&s;s, had we wherewithal to provide for our immediate &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. Having weighed the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, and the mi&s;ery of peri&s;hing by hunger, I was of opinion, as well as the mate, that it would be mo&s;t advi&s;eable to &s;acrifice one, for the pre&s;ervation of the re&s;t; and that the mo&s;t pro|per method would be, by ca&s;ting lots, which &s;hould be the unfortunate victim. But this &s;hocking, though prudent, re&s;olution, we agreed to put off to the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>We had not been able to &s;ecure our boat &s;o effectually, but that the &s;ea had beat her higher up on the beach, and filled her with &s;and. We were obliged, therefore, to &s;et two of the men to work in clearing her, and afterwards in &s;topping the leaks, as already de&s;cribed; while the re|mainder of our party was detached by different routes along the &s;hore, to &s;ee if they could find any kind of provi&s;ion. The mate and my&s;elf travelled along the &s;andy beach, till we were pre|vented from going any farther, by an inlet of wa|ter, when we were a good deal &s;urpri&s;ed, to ob|&s;erve the tide ebb and flow every ten minutes. We were not, however, at pre&s;ent, in a di&s;po&s;i|tion to pay much regard to this or any other ex|traordinary
<PB N="48" REF="045437_0380_102029791D0A5F38">
appearance of nature; and &s;eeing a great quantity of oy&s;ter-&s;hells lying upon the &s;hore, we &s;earched them diligently, in hopes of finding &s;ome that were full; but without &s;uc|ce&s;s. This again made us cur&s;e our de&s;tiny, that we &s;hould have been ca&s;t away on &s;o barren and mi&s;erable a country, and in &s;uch an unluc|ky time of the year, when we were not only de|prived of the relief we might have got, at any other &s;ea&s;on, from the natural productions of the earth, but when even the animals, inhabitants of both elements, had retired to their holes and hi|ding places, to &s;hield them&s;elves from the inten&s;e cold which prevails during the winter, in this in|ho&s;pitable climate.</P>
<P>We &s;till continued our &s;earch, notwith&s;tand|ing the ill &s;ucce&s;s we had hitherto experienced, and contrived, at length, to gather about two quarts of hips, or wild ro&s;e-buds, by throwing up the &s;now, and &s;earching in different parts of the bank. Having, with this &s;orry food, allayed, in &s;ome degree, the keen &s;en&s;e of hunger, and the wind having become &s;omewhat more moder|ate, we got into our boat, and pu&s;hed off, the day being already drawing toward a conclu&s;ion. Our progre&s;s was, however, &s;oon impeded by the quantity of ice that floated upon the water; which obliged us to put a&s;hore on another part of the &s;ame beach. In landing, I had the mis|fortune to let the tinder-box fall from my bo&s;om into the water, by which means we were unable to kindle a fire; and being exceedingly wet, as was generally the ca&s;e, when we landed, we were, in this place, in a mo&s;t uncomfortable &s;itu|ation,
<PB N="49" REF="045437_0381_1020297C4E8C03A8">
and &s;uffered much from the cold. We therefore, thought it be&s;t to get into our boat a|gain as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and return to the &s;pot from whence we came, in hopes of finding &s;ome fire &s;till remaining.</P>
<P>It was with the greate&s;t difficulty we got back, being the whole way under the nece&s;&s;ity of breaking through the ice, which had, by this time, formed almo&s;t into a &s;olid &s;heet. We were very anxious, le&s;t our fire &s;hould mean|while, have gone out, and thought it a lucky circum&s;tance, we had not been able to go any farther from it. On our arrival at the place, we had the &s;atisfaction to find, it was not totally extingui&s;hed: had this been the ca&s;e, we mu&s;t have peri&s;hed in the cour&s;e of the night. The fire being repaired, I cut up the remainder of my &s;hirt to make &s;ome more tinder; and, as the damage it got had nearly proved fatal to us, was re&s;olved to be more particular in my care of it for the future.</P>
<P>On the 8th of February, the wind came round to the &s;outh-we&s;t, which cleared off the ice, and enabled us to leave this place by ten o'clock in the morning. As we proceeded a|long the &s;hore, we found it was not quite &s;o rocky as it had been on the other &s;ide of the north cape. We were therefore able to land this night, without difficulty, within a large rock, by which we were &s;heltered from the wind and &s;ea. We were here very comfortably &s;itu|ated, in every re&s;pect, except our want of provi|&s;ions. The next day, the weather continuing moderate, we had again proceeded about eight
<PB N="50" REF="045437_0382_1020297DD786E360">
miles on our journey, when the wind beginning to blow &s;o hard as to rai&s;e a con&s;iderable &s;well, we were obliged to &s;teer to the &s;nore; and in landing, had the misfortune to lo&s;e two of our oars, which were wa&s;hed overboard by the &s;urf.</P>
<P>On the following day, the wind lulled; and we immediately took the advantage of it, to put to &s;ea. We had now but two oars remaining; which being double-manned, we contrived to get about &s;ix miles before night. This was a very hard day's work, con&s;idering our pre&s;ent weak condition; for, having been a length of time without ta&s;ting any kind of nouri&s;hment, we were &s;o much reduced in &s;trength, that when we got on &s;hore, we could &s;carcely walk for fifty yards together.</P>
<P>The weather being unfavourable on the 11th, we were under the nece&s;&s;ity of remaining the whole day in the &s;ame re&s;ting-place; and, hav|ing lei&s;ure to &s;earch about the &s;hore, we were fortunate enough to find a few ro&s;e-buds, which we e&s;teemed at pre&s;ent a great delicacy. Had we not met with this &s;upply, it would have been ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to put our beforementioned &s;cheme into execution. We thought our&s;elves extremely unlucky, in not having found, in the cour&s;e of our wanderings, &s;o much as the body of any dead animal: nor, except the partridge, did we &s;ee any live one, that we had the &s;malle&s;t chance of capturing. At different times, we had hopes of catching &s;ome of the others that we frequently &s;aw on the ice, particularly on the &s;mall rivers and inlets: but we never found them at any di&s;tance from the holes, which they
<PB N="51" REF="045437_0383_102029810079A888">
continually kept open, to give them&s;elves a free pa&s;&s;age in and out of the water. We likewi&s;e di&s;covered, at different times, &s;ome beaver's hou&s;es; but could not in&s;nare any of the ani|mals.</P>
<P>On the 12th, the wind became moderate, and we proceeded, once more, on our journey. The coa&s;t &s;eemed to dimini&s;h in height as we pa&s;&s;ed along it, which made us hope we were now ap|proaching the cultivated part of the i&s;land. Next day the weather got milder, with a fall of rain: &s;o that it was with difficulty we could get our boat to &s;wim, the ice thawing gradually off the bottom. This obliged us to put a&s;hore long be|fore night; and when we had landed, and made a fire, we found no other immediate want but that of provi&s;ions, having con&s;umed all the hips or ro&s;e-buds that we had gathered at our la&s;t landing-place.</P>
<P>Having reconnoitred, very carefully, all around, and &s;earched in every part under the &s;now, we were not able to procure our&s;elves even that mi|&s;erable &s;u&s;tenance. Being now driven to the la&s;t extremity, we were obliged to &s;acrifice our pro|&s;pect of travelling any farther, to the immediate pre&s;ervation of our lives. About a dozen tal|low candles remained, which we had hitherto employed in &s;topping the leaks of our boat, as fa&s;t as &s;he &s;prung one in any particular place. Of the&s;e we divided a &s;mall part among us; which gave us &s;ome relief for the pre&s;ent. The two following days we coa&s;ted for a few miles, &s;earch|ing for a place where we could meet with &s;ome hips; but our &s;earch proved ineffectual. This
<PB N="52" REF="045437_0384_1020298550C7F5A0">
was the only kind of food we could now expect; and had we di&s;covered any place that abounded with them, it was our intention to draw up the boat there, and remain till they were con&s;um|ed.</P>
<P>We began now to be fully &s;en&s;ible of our de&s;|perate &s;ituation, and to expect that our fate would be that of peri&s;hing with hunger. Notwith|&s;tanding that idea was horrid enough, yet, what gave me the mo&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, was, that my friends would probably forever remain uninformed of our wretched cata&s;trophe. It may appear to tho&s;e, who have not been in &s;imilar circum|&s;tances, that this would take up but a &s;mall part of one's reflection, in compari&s;on with the dread of &s;uch a death; yet, however it might have been with the re&s;t of my companions, it was that idea that chiefly preyed upon my &s;pirits. In or|der to prevent it, as far as po&s;&s;ible, I took every occa&s;ion of cutting out my name on the bark of the large&s;t trees. The fatigue of cutting it, as well as the pre&s;ervation of my knife, which I ob&s;erved before, was the only one among us, would not allow me to be more particular. But on the walls of the &s;tore-hou&s;es, which we had di&s;covered in the beginning of our progre&s;s, I wrote a &s;hort account of our di&s;a&s;ters in Engli&s;h and French, and reque&s;ted, if any per&s;on &s;hould fall in with it, that they would tran&s;mit it to my father at Quebec.</P>
<P>On the 17th, we made another divi&s;ion of a part of the tallow candles that yet remained; and on the following day, the wind being fa|vourable, we proceeded about five miles: where,
<PB N="53" REF="045437_0385_1020298847E30330">
finding a flat country, and a &s;andy beach, that extended for a con&s;iderable way, and being &s;o much debilitated, that we knew it would be im|po&s;&s;ible for us to go much farther, we put on &s;hore, with a determined re&s;olution to peri&s;h on this place, unle&s;s &s;ome unfore&s;een accident &s;hould bring us relief. To attempt drawing up our boat, would, in our pre&s;ent weak condition, be a vain undertaking, &s;o we were obliged to leave her, expo&s;ed to the mercy of the &s;ea. All that we could pre&s;erve was our axe, a &s;aw, and the &s;ail of the boat, which we generally made u&s;e of as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">covering.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we landed, we made it our bu&s;i|ne&s;s to clear away the &s;now from a particular &s;pot in the entrance of the wood, where we in|tended to remain; and having cut &s;ome &s;mall branches of pine to lie upon, together with &s;ome larger to &s;erve for a &s;helter, which we &s;tuck into the bank of &s;now that &s;urrounded us, we made our fire. This done, we all went in &s;earch of hips, and had the good fortune to find about a pint of them, which, boiled up with a couple of tallow candles, afforded us a tolerable meal.</P>
<P>The next day we pa&s;&s;ed without any kind of provi&s;ions, and being apprehen&s;ive that our little remaining &s;trength would &s;oon de&s;ert us, we em|ployed our&s;elves in cutting and piling as much wood as we were able, to &s;upply the fire. Mean while, the waves had beat our boat &s;o high upon the beach, as to be quite dry as &s;oon as the wind &s;ub&s;ided, and to deprive us of the power of put|ting to &s;ea again: had we been di&s;po&s;ed to do it:
<PB N="54" REF="045437_0386_101FFC7A52A354F0">
for our &s;trength was by no means equal to the ta&s;k of moving her a &s;ingle foot.</P>
<P>We again employed the whole day of the 19th in &s;earch of hips; but it was not attended with any &s;ucce&s;s. Our tallow candles were, there|fore, the only re&s;ource we had left, and by this time they became reduced to two. We found our&s;elves &s;o much weakened the following day, that we could make no further u&s;e of our axe, and were under the nece&s;&s;ity of creeping about in our turns, to gather for our fire the rotten branches of trees, that lay &s;cattered upon the ground. As we had not a proper quantity of fuel, the fire that we kept up was but ju&s;t &s;uffi|cient to pre&s;erve us from freezing: for, though the &s;ea&s;on was &s;o far advanced toward the &s;pring, yet, excepting &s;ome particular days, the weather was as cold as in the month of December.</P>
<P>Having now no more than two tallow candles remaining, and finding no longer a po&s;&s;ibility of gathering any hips, being too weak even to &s;earch for them, we thought it likely that we might de|rive &s;ome degree of nouri&s;hment from the kelp-weed, of which there was a quantity lying upon the &s;hore. We accordingly collected a little of it, and with melted &s;now boiled it for a few hours in a kettle; but, at the conclu&s;ion, found it very little tenderer than at fir&s;t. We then melted one of our tallow candles in the liquor, and having &s;upped it up, and eat a quantity of the weed, our appetite became &s;omewhat &s;atia|ted: but in about two hours time, we were all affected with a very unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation, and were &s;oon after &s;eized with a fit of vomiting, without
<PB N="55" REF="045437_0387_1020298CC346D248">
being able to bring the offending matter entirely off the &s;tomach. This fit of vomiting having continued for about four hours, we found our|&s;elves tolerably ea&s;y, but, at the &s;ame time, ex|ceedingly exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>On the 22d we made u&s;e of &s;ome more kelp-weed and our la&s;t tallow candle. It &s;till opera|ted in the &s;ame manner, but not to &s;o violent a degree as it had done before. The next day the wind blew very moderate from the north-we&s;t, and brought a &s;evere fro&s;t along with it. We had now an opportunity to repair our boat; and, if our &s;trength had been &s;ufficient to launch into the water, we &s;hould have changed our re&s;olu|tion, and have quitted the place. We made, in|deed, a faint attempt to launch the boat; but, on finding that we could not move her an inch from where &s;he lay upon the &s;hore, we were o|bliged to give over the de&s;ign. Our candles be|ing all con&s;umed, we were under the nece&s;&s;ity of boiling the kelp-weed, without the mixture of tallow, which, however nau&s;eous at any other time, afforded us, then, not only &s;ome kind of nouri&s;hment, but even an exqui&s;ite reli&s;h.</P>
<P>Having, for three days, ta&s;ted no other food but the kelp-weed, we began to &s;well to an alarming degree. This we were at a lo&s;s whe|ther to attribute to the kelp-weed, or to the cold (for we were not able to keep a &s;ufficient fire): however, I thought then, and do &s;till believe, that it proceeded from the former; for, notwith|&s;tanding we had often before been expo&s;ed to the utmo&s;t &s;everity of the fro&s;t, and &s;ometimes with|out any &s;helter whatever, yet we had never found
<PB N="56" REF="045437_0388_102029911FDF0308">
our&s;elves affected with this extraordinary &s;ymp|tom; but, on the contrary, were as much redu|ced in bulk as we were in &s;trength: whereas in a few days, the &s;welling had increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree all over our bodies, that, notwith&s;tanding the little fle&s;h we had upon our bones, we could &s;ink our fingers two inches deep on the &s;kin; the impre&s;&s;ion of which remained vi&s;ible for a|bove an hour after. Hunger, neverthele&s;s, &s;till obliged us to make u&s;e of the kelp-weed. I have never &s;ince con&s;ulted with any naturali&s;t or phy|&s;ician about the extraordinary effects of this weed; yet doubt not but they may be accounted for from natural cau&s;es.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed a few days more in the &s;ame man|ner; at the expiration of which, we were &s;o much &s;wollen, as to be almo&s;t deprived of our &s;ight, and &s;o reduced in &s;trength, that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty we could keep our fire in by crawling about in turn, and breaking the rotten branches that lay &s;cattered upon the &s;now. The time was now arrived, when I thought it highly expedient to put the plan beforemention|ed into execution; but, on feeling the pul&s;e of my companions, found, that &s;ome of them were rather aver&s;e to the propo&s;al; the de&s;ire of life &s;till prevailing above every other &s;entiment, not|with&s;tanding the wretched condition they were in, and the impo&s;&s;ibility even of pre&s;erving it by any other method.</P>
<P>I thought it an extraordinary in&s;tance of in|fatuation, that men &s;hould prefer the certainty of a lingering and mi&s;erable death, to the di&s;tant chance of one more immediate and le&s;s painful.
<PB N="57" REF="045437_0389_102029941B552588">
However, on con&s;ulting with the mate, what was to be done, I found, that, though they objected to the propo&s;al of ca&s;ting lots which &s;hould be the victim, yet, all concurred, in the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome one being &s;acrificed for the pre&s;ervation of the re&s;t. The only que&s;tion was, how it &s;hould be determined; when, by a kind of rea&s;oning more agreeable to the dictates of &s;elf-love than of ju&s;tice, it was agreed on, that, as the captain was now &s;o exceedingly reduced, as to be evidently the fir&s;t who would &s;ink under our pre&s;ent com|plicated mi&s;ery; as he had been the per&s;on to whom we con&s;idered our&s;elves, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, indebted for all our misfortunes; and fur|ther, as he had, ever &s;ince our &s;hipwreck, been the mo&s;t remi&s;s in his exertions towards the ge|neral good, he was, undoubtedly, the per&s;on who &s;hould be the fir&s;t &s;acrificed.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I thought, at that time, there was &s;ome colour of truth in this conclu&s;i|on: yet, I was not a little &s;hocked at the cap|tain's intended fate, although I had more rea&s;on than any one el&s;e to be incen&s;ed again&s;t him, not only on account of his neglect of duty, and his mal-practices at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut in purloining our provi|&s;ions, but for another rea&s;on likewi&s;e. After our &s;hipwreck, I had di&s;covered, by &s;ome papers, which had been wa&s;hed on &s;hore, that, though the captain's pretended de&s;tination was to New-York, yet his real one was to the We&s;t-Indies, if he could po&s;&s;ibly effect it Thus would he have baffled General Haldimand's intentions, in &s;ending me with di&s;patches, that might be of the
<PB N="58" REF="045437_0390_10202995A7017558">
fir&s;t con&s;equence to this country; and not only have di&s;appointed, but al&s;o have defrauded me of the money which I paid him for my pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The determination now made, was kept &s;ecret from the captain; and it would have been im|po&s;&s;ible for us to live many days longer, without putting it into execution, had we not happily met with relief from a quarter whence we little expected it. On the 28th of February, as we were all lying about our fire, we thought that we heard the &s;ound of human voices in the woods; and &s;oon after di&s;covered two Indians, with guns in their hands, who did not &s;eem yet to have perceived us. This &s;ight gave us fre&s;h &s;trength and &s;pirits: &s;o, getting up, we advanced towards them with the greate&s;t eagerne&s;s imagi|nable.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were perceived by the Indians, they &s;tarted back, and &s;eemed fixed for a few moments to the ground with &s;urpri&s;e and horror. This, indeed, is not to be wondered at, when it is con&s;idered, that, be&s;ides the amazement they mu&s;t naturally have felt, on &s;uddenly meeting with white men in this uninhabited part of the i&s;land, our appearance it&s;elf, was enough to alarm the mo&s;t intrepid: our cloaths being almo&s;t en|tirely burnt off, &s;o that we were bare in &s;everal parts of our bodies, our limbs &s;wollen to a pro|digious bulk, our eyes, from the &s;ame cau&s;e, al|mo&s;t invi&s;ible, and our hair in a confu&s;ed and di&s;hevelled &s;tate about our heads and &s;houlders, particularly of tho&s;e who wore it long; for we had not been able to comb it &s;ince our &s;hipwreck. As we advanced toward the Indians, &s;ome of us
<PB N="59" REF="045437_0391_1020299893893880">
wept, while others laughed through joy. Being a little recovered from their &s;urpri&s;e, they did not &s;hew much inclination to acco&s;t us, till I got up to one of them, and took him by the hand; when he &s;hook it for &s;ome time very heartily; the u&s;ual mode of &s;alutation among the Indi|ans.</P>
<P>They began, at length, to &s;hew marks of com|pa&s;&s;ion at our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed appearance; and I ima|gine, their &s;hyne&s;s at fir&s;t proceeded from the re|pugnance which it naturally in&s;pired: for, the&s;e Indians being converted to Chri&s;tianity, I will not attribute it to a motive &s;o contrary to that doctrine, as the idea of the trouble they might expect, without any compen&s;ation, in relieving us. They then walked with us to our fire, and, &s;itting down by it together, one of them, who could &s;peak a little broken French, de&s;ired we would inform him whence we came, and the particulars of the accident that brought us there. I accordingly gave him as conci&s;e an account as po&s;&s;ible, of the di&s;a&s;ters and fatigues we had un|dergone: during the relation, he &s;eemed to be very much affected at our &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed my narration, I a&s;ked the In|dian, if he could furni&s;h us with any kind of provi&s;ions: to which he an&s;wered in the affir|mative. Ob&s;erving that we had very little fire, he &s;uddenly &s;tarted up, and took our axe in his hand; when, looking at it, and laughing hearti|ly, I &s;uppo&s;e at the badne&s;s of it, he threw it down again, and taking his tomahawk from his &s;ide, which is a &s;mall hatchet that the Indians al|ways carry about them, he went, and, in a &s;hort
<PB N="60" REF="045437_0392_10202AA2CB0D9AE8">
time, cut a quantity of wood, which he brought, and threw upon our fire. This done, he took up his gun, and, without &s;aying a word, went off with his companion.</P>
<P>This would have been a very alarming cir|cum&s;tance to per&s;ons ignorant of the Indian manners; but I was &s;o well acquainted with the humour of the&s;e people, who &s;eldom &s;peak when there is not an ab&s;olute occa&s;ion for it, that I doubted not, but they were gone for &s;ome provi|&s;ions, and that we &s;hould &s;ee them again very &s;hortly. Notwith&s;tanding the length of time we had been without nouri&s;hment, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, that I felt but little inclination to eat: the fire which the Indian had made, was the great|e&s;t refre&s;hment to us, as we had been many days without a good one.</P>
<P>After about three days had elap&s;ed, during which interval, &s;ome of our party were not without anxiety, le&s;t the Indians &s;hould never return, we perceived them coming round a point, at a &s;mall di&s;tance, in a bark canoe. Being ar|rived, and landed upon the beach, they took out of their canoe &s;ome &s;moked veni&s;on, and a blad|der of &s;eal oil; which they brought up to our fire-place: having put &s;ome of the meat into our kettle, they boiled it in melted &s;now; and then gave each of us a very &s;mall quantity of it, together with &s;ome oil. I knew very well their rea&s;on for being &s;o &s;paring of their meat; for, eating a quantity of gro&s;s food in our pre&s;ent &s;tate, might be attended with the mo&s;t fatal con|&s;equences. It gave me no &s;mall plea&s;ure to find that the Indians were &s;o careful of us.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="045437_0393_101FFC8F0F40F7E0">
This light repa&s;t being ended, the Indians de|&s;ired three of us to embark in their canoe, that being all &s;he could carry at a time, and proceed from this place to their hut, which lay five miles farther by water, and about a mile from the &s;hore, in the middle of the woods. We were received at the &s;ea &s;ide by three other Indians, and about twelve or fourteen women and chil|dren, who had been there waiting our arrival. Having landed from the canoe, we were conduc|ted by the&s;e la&s;t to their habitation in the wood, which con&s;i&s;ted of three huts or wigwams, there being that number of families among them: meanwhile, the &s;ame two Indians who had brought us, went back in their canoe for the three re|maining men of our party. On arriving at the but, we were treated, with the greate&s;t humanity by the&s;e people; they gave us &s;ome broth to &s;up, but would not &s;uffer us to eat meat, or any kind of &s;ub&s;tantial food whatever.</P>
<P>The two Indians being come back with our companions, and having all received a tolerable refre&s;hment I was de&s;ired, at the reque&s;t of a very old woman, who appeared to be mi&s;tre&s;s or mother of the families pre&s;ent, to give them an account of our tran&s;actions &s;ince the day of our &s;hipwreck. I accordingly gave a more particular account, than I had done before in French to the Indian, whom I have already mentioned; and he explained it in his own language to the other Indians. In the cour&s;e of my relation, I could perceive that the old woman was exceedingly affected, at certain parts of it; which gave me much &s;atisfaction, as I thence derived hopes,
<PB N="62" REF="045437_0394_101FFC90AD1C7258">
that they would continue, to treat us with the &s;ame humanity. As &s;oon as I had done &s;peaking. the old woman ro&s;e up, and after &s;upplying us with &s;ome more broth, de&s;ired the interpreter to explain to us, the &s;hipwreck of the famous French parti&s;an St. Luc Lacorne, on his pa&s;&s;age from Canada to France.</P>
<P>He informed me, that this gentleman, of who&s;e &s;hipwreck I had already heard &s;omething, was ca&s;t away directly upon the North-Cape; that a great number of per&s;ons, peri&s;hed on the occa&s;ion, among&s;t whom, were two of Mr. St. Luc's children, who were drowned in his arms, as he was attempting to carry them on &s;hore. He likewi&s;e informed me, that after his having remained five days there, and &s;uffered much from cold and hunger, he him&s;elf had relieved him, and conducted him to Loui&s;bourg; for which &s;ervice, he &s;aid, Mr. St. Luc was indebted to him thirty pounds, which he promi&s;ed to remit from Halifax, but had never performed it. Whether this part of the Indian's &s;tory be true or not, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to determine: the gentleman him&s;elf, is be&s;t acquainted with it. But this I am certain of, that the poor Indians mu&s;t have earned the money very dearly, in con|ducting him &s;o far, at the &s;ea&s;on of the year in which the journey was performed.</P>
<P>The&s;e people did every thing in their power, to reduce the &s;welling from our limbs; which they at length accompli&s;hed, after much diffi|culty. Having provided for our own immediate wants, our thoughts recurred to tho&s;e unfortu|nate men, whom we had left by the wreck. We
<PB N="63" REF="045437_0395_101FFC942C7D86C0">
were under much anxiety for them, le&s;t by this time they might have peri&s;hed with hunger. However, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be &s;till alive, I was determined, no means &s;hould be omitted for their pre&s;ervation; and, having de&s;cribed to the Indi|ans the part of the i&s;land we were ca&s;t away upon, a&s;ked them, if it was po&s;&s;ible to go to their relief?</P>
<P>From the de&s;cription I gave the Indians of the &s;ituation of the river, and of a &s;mall i&s;land that lay nearly oppo&s;ite, they &s;aid, that they knew the place perfectly well; that it was above one hundred miles di&s;tant, through very difficult paths, over rivers and mountains; and that, if they undertook the journey, they mu&s;t expect &s;ome compen&s;ation for their trouble. This in|deed was but rea&s;onable: for it could not be ex|pected, that the Indians &s;hould leave their hunt|ing, by which alone they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted their wives and families, to undergo a fatigue of that kind through pure benevolence: and as to their ac|count of the di&s;tance, I could ea&s;ily give credit to it, as I knew we had come above one hun|dred and fifty miles by water. I then informed them, for the fir&s;t time, for in fact it did not oc|cur to me before, that I had &s;ome money, and that, if it would be any object to them, I would pay them for their trouble. They &s;eemed much plea&s;ed when I told them that I had money, and de&s;ired me to let them look at it. Then taking the pur&s;e from my &s;ervant, I &s;hewed them the hundred and eighty guineas that it contained; and ob&s;erving an eagerne&s;s in their countenances at the &s;ight of the coin, which I had little ex|pected
<PB N="64" REF="045437_0396_101FFC97984DA630">
among Indians, and that the women, in particular, &s;eemed to have taken a &s;trong fancy to it, I pre&s;ented them with a guinea each; for which they expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atisfaction, by laugh|ing, the only method among the &s;avages of di&s;|playing every &s;entiment of that nature.</P>
<P>However, I was determined, at all events, to &s;ave the people, if any of them remained alive, though the Indians &s;hould be ever &s;o exorbitant in their demands; and made an agreement with them, at la&s;t, that they &s;hould &s;et off the next day, which was the &s;econd of March, and that they &s;hould receive twenty-five guineas at their departure, and the &s;ame &s;um on their return. This being adju&s;ted, they immediately went to work in making a proper number of mawki&s;ins and &s;now-&s;hoes, for them&s;elves and for the men; and three of them went off the next morning, having received the &s;um of money agreed for.</P>
<P>After the&s;e people knew that I had money, my &s;ituation among them was not near &s;o comfort|able as before; for they became as mercenary as they had hitherto been charitable, and exacted above ten times the value, for every little nece&s;|&s;ary they furni&s;hed for my&s;elf and the re&s;t of my companions. Be&s;ides which, I was under con|&s;tant apprehen&s;ion, le&s;t they &s;hould be incited, by this extraordinary pa&s;&s;ion for money, to plunder us, and leave us in the &s;ame de&s;titute condition in which they found us. The only circum|&s;tance, on which I founded my hope of better treatment from them, was their religion: for, as I mentioned before, they were Chri&s;tians, and rigid Catholics, having been converted by the
<PB N="65" REF="045437_0397_101FFC9920431FF0">
French, before we got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land. But, perhaps, it was this very circum&s;tance of their communication with Chri&s;tians, that had in&s;pired them with that vehement love of money. They &s;hewed, indeed, every mark of attachment to their faith, being very a&s;&s;iduous at their devo|tions both night and morning; and frequently gave us cau&s;e to wi&s;h they had not been quite &s;o devout, by di&s;turbing us with their p&s;alm-&s;inging the whole night. I was very much afraid, at times, if they had learnt that tenet of their &s;ect, of keeping no faith with heretics, that their profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity would be of little &s;ervice to us. My &s;ervant, being an Iri&s;h Ca|tholic, they were exceedingly fond of him, and heaped their favours upon him very profu&s;ely. He joined them, for the mo&s;t part, in their roar|ing, for I cannot, with propriety, call it &s;inging, and in their prayers; though he did not under|&s;tand a word of either. Indeed, I que&s;tion much whether they them&s;elves under&s;tood them, for they were the mo&s;t confu&s;ed jargon I ever heard, compounded of their own and the French lan|guage, with the mixture of a few broken Latin phra&s;es, which they had picked up from their converters, the Je&s;uits.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;ular &s;avages bore, in general, an ex|act re&s;emblance, in their per&s;ons and manners, to tho&s;e on the continent of America. The principal points in which they differed were, in having their hair long, which is peculiar to the women alone among the continental Indians, and in wearing caps and breeches. Their lan|guage was very different from that of tho&s;e na|tions,
<PB N="66" REF="045437_0398_1020299CE47CC260">
or tribes, which I was acquainted with; though I doubt not but it might have a re&s;em|blance to &s;ome other upon the continent. I found afterwards, when we got into a part of the i&s;land where it was to be had, that they had the &s;ame &s;trong propen&s;ity to &s;pirituous liquor, &s;o univer&s;al among the Indians.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time before we had recovered any degree of &s;trength, or could dige&s;t any &s;ub&s;tantial food: The only kind we could get from the Indians, was the fle&s;h of moo&s;e-deer, and &s;eal oil; on which they &s;ub&s;i&s;t entirely, during the time of hunting. Notwith&s;tanding that we found our&s;elves, after our late mi&s;eries, pretty comfortably &s;ituated among tho&s;e &s;avages, yet I was anxious to get away, on account of the di&s;|patches I was charged with, which I thought might be of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to his ma|je&s;ty's &s;ervice; particularly, as I knew that the duplicates were lo&s;t. I continued, however, in &s;o weak a condition, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to move for &s;ome time; and found, as well as my fellow &s;ufferers, that &s;uch a &s;hock to the con&s;titution, was not ea&s;ily to be repaired.</P>
<P>After being ab&s;ent near a fortnight, the Indi|ans arrived with three men, who were the only &s;urvivors of the eight, who had been left behind at the hut. They were in a very reduced and mi&s;erable condition, and informed me, on en|quiring the particulars of their tran&s;actions from the time we left them, that, after having con|&s;umed all the beef, they lived, for &s;ome days, on the &s;kin of the moo&s;e-deer, which we had left entire, not thinking it worth while to make a
<PB N="67" REF="045437_0399_1020299FDD364D50">
partition of it. This being con&s;umed, three of them died, in a few days, of hunger, and the o|thers, were under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on the fle&s;h of the dead men, till they were relieved by the Indians. One of the remaining five was &s;o imprudently ravenous, when the Indians came to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as to eat &s;uch a quantity of meat, that he expired in a few hours, in the greate&s;t agonies imaginable; and another, &s;oon after, &s;hot him&s;elf, accidentally, with one of the Indian's guns. Thus was our number, which originally con&s;i&s;ted of nineteen per&s;ons, reduced to nine; and I rather wonder, how &s;o many per&s;ons could, for the &s;pace of three months, go through &s;uch complicated di&s;tre&s;&s;es, from exce&s;|&s;ive cold, fatigue, and hunger.</P>
<P>We all remained another fortnight among the Indians, during which, I was obliged to pay, as before, a mo&s;t exorbitant price for our diet, and for every nece&s;&s;ary that we were provided with. By this time, my health being &s;omewhat re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, and my money, at the &s;ame time, very much reduced, I was re&s;olved to po&s;tpone my own convenience, to the good of the &s;ervice, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o proceed, as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, with General Haldimand's di&s;patches, though it was now the mo&s;t unfavourable &s;ea&s;on of the year for travel|ling. I therefore made an agreement with the In|dians, to conduct me to Halifax; for which I was to pay them forty-five pounds, and to fur|ni&s;h them with provi&s;ions, and all nece&s;&s;aries, at every inhabited place, on our way.</P>
<P>It was &s;ettled, that I &s;hould depart on the 2d of April, with two Indians, for Halifax, accom|panied
<PB N="68" REF="045437_0400_102029A167F15F50">
by Mr. Win&s;low, a young gentleman who had been a pa&s;&s;enger on board the ve&s;&s;el, and was one of the three &s;urvivors at the hut, together with my own &s;ervant. The Indians were to conduct the remainder of our party, to a &s;et|tlement on Spani&s;h river, about fifty miles di&s;|tant, where they were to remain till the &s;pring, when an opportunity might offer for them to get by &s;ea to Halifax. Previou&s;ly to parting, I gave the captain ca&s;h for a bill on his owner at New-York, to provide for the immediate &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of him&s;elf and the &s;ailors; which bill was af|terwards prote&s;ted by the owner, on the pretence, that the &s;hip being lo&s;t, neither ma&s;ter nor crew were entitled to any wages.</P>
<P>We accordingly &s;at off on the day appointed, each carrying four pair of Indian &s;hoes, or maw|ki&s;ins, a pair of &s;now-&s;hoes, and provi&s;ions for fifteen days. The &s;ame day, we got to a place called, by the Engli&s;h, Broad-Oar, where we were detained, the following day, by a &s;now|&s;torm. On the 4th, we again proceeded through the woods about five leagues; and, on the 5th, arrived at a place named Broad-Deck, which lies at the entrance of a very fine &s;alt water lake, called Lake St. Peter. This lake communicates, by a narrow inlet, with the &s;ea, from which it is di&s;tant about &s;ixteen leagues. At this place, we met with two families of Indians, who were hunting there, and purcha&s;ed of them a bark-canoe, for five pounds; the Indians having in|formed me, that &s;ome parts of this great lake are never frozen, and that it was requi&s;ite to have a canoe to pa&s;s over tho&s;e places; and as
<PB N="69" REF="045437_0401_102029A45659D510">
we were to travel over the ice in other parts of it, I was obliged to purcha&s;e two Indian &s;leighs, in which we were to place the canoe, and drag it after us.</P>
<P>Having remained two days in this place, and provided our&s;elves with a few other nece&s;&s;ary ar|ticles, we proceeded on the 7th, for a few miles along the lake; but the ice being bad, we were &s;oon obliged to take to the wood. A thaw com|ing on &s;oon after, with rain, made the &s;now, which lay to the depth of &s;ix feet in the woods, &s;o &s;oft and heavy, that we could travel no long|er on our &s;now-&s;hoes, the &s;now &s;ticking to them in large quantities. We were therefore obliged to make a fire, and remain here; and the thaw continuing for the &s;pace of four days, made us very apprehen&s;ive le&s;t the ice &s;hould give way al|together: for the &s;pring was now too far advan|ced, to travel any longer upon the &s;now, unle&s;s during a fro&s;t. We &s;hould then have been un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of waiting till the ice was en|tirely cleared off the lake; which would have taken at lea&s;t a fortnight or three weeks from the time of its breaking up; in which ca&s;e, we might have been reduced to a condition, equally di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, with that we had been in after our &s;hipwreck, except that we were provided with arms and ammunition.</P>
<P>However, the fro&s;t returned on the 12th, and the next day we &s;at off, and travelled about &s;ix leagues; &s;ometimes on floating pieces of ice, and at others, in our canoe, where the lake was open. On the 14th, our provi&s;ions being nearly ex|hau&s;ted, I propo&s;ed going in &s;earch of &s;ome
<PB N="70" REF="045437_0402_102029A8A4EF0848">
game, as the country abounded with deer: for the Indians, in general, never think of provid|ing for the next day's wants, but eat on, without reflection, whil&s;t they have a mor&s;el of food re|maining. I accordingly went with one of the Indians into the woods. We had not been three hours on the hunt, before we di&s;covered a very fine moo&s;e-deer; and the Indian &s;hot him in a|bout an hour after. We &s;kinned this animal, which weighed about &s;ix hundred pounds, load|ed our&s;elves with &s;ome of the be&s;t parts of its fle&s;h, as well as the blood, which the Indian took care to collect, putting it in the bladder of the bea&s;t: and returned to our canoe. We then &s;ent the other Indian, Mr. Win&s;low, and my &s;ervant, for &s;ome more of the meat, of which they brought about an hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Being now well &s;tocked with provi&s;ions, we had no rea&s;on to apprehend that we &s;hould want, in ca&s;e a return of mild weather &s;hould render it impo&s;&s;ible for us to travel either upon the lake or in the woods. On the 15th, we &s;at out ve|ry early in the morning, and pur&s;ued our jour|ney about &s;ix leagues, in the &s;ame manner as be|fore. The greate&s;t inconvenience that we felt, was the want of bread, which the Indians of this country never make u&s;e of whil&s;t they are hunt|ing; and being now much wearied with travel|ling, our &s;trength having been greatly exhau&s;ted by our pa&s;t fatigues, we agreed to make a halt for a day or two, in the woods. What renders the travelling through the woods, in the&s;e cold climates, more tolerable than might be &s;uppo&s;ed during the winter &s;ea&s;on, is the number of pine-trees,
<PB N="71" REF="045437_0403_102029AA304160D8">
and other ever-greens, which are inter&s;per|&s;ed in different parts; the branches of which &s;erve, not only to lie upon, but al&s;o as a &s;helter from the &s;everity of the weather. We cho&s;e a &s;pot abounding with the&s;e trees; and it is almo&s;t inconceivable, in how &s;hort a time the Indians made us a comfortable habitation of the boughs, called in their language, a <HI>wigwam.</HI> Their method of con&s;tructing them is as follows; having cho&s;en the &s;pot for their fire, they fir&s;t clear off the &s;now, throwing it up into a bank in a circular form, leaving a vacant &s;pace, or pa&s;|&s;age, to leeward: and it is to be ob&s;erved, that the more &s;now there is on the ground the bet|ter, as it makes the be&s;t part of the &s;helter. They then cut branches of pines, of a proper length, and placing the thicker ends of them in the bank of &s;now, bend and interweave them to|ward the top. The&s;e branches are cro&s;&s;ed by others, and interwoven with &s;maller ones, in &s;uch a manner, as to afford a &s;ufficient &s;helter from the wind, and from the fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing &s;now. The fire is made in the middle of the wigwam, and the &s;moke of it goes out by the pa&s;&s;age to lee|ward. The wigwams thus made, are very comfortable, even in the colde&s;t weather, and are proof again&s;t any thing but a heavy rain; be&s;ide which, a change of wind is the only in|convenience they are liable to.</P>
<P>We proceeded again on our journey, on the 18th, and, during that and the following day, travelled &s;everal miles, without meeting with any thing remarkable. I had now lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve the beauties of this lake, which was one of the
<PB N="72" REF="045437_0404_102029AD78328D08">
fine&s;t I ever &s;aw in America; though at this &s;ea|&s;on of the year, it could not appear to the be&s;t advantage. As far as I could judge, it is about twenty leagues in length from north to &s;outh, and eight wide from ea&s;t to we&s;t. A number of &s;mall i&s;lands are &s;cattered about in different parts of it, and give it &s;omewhat the appearance of the lake of Killarny, and other fre&s;h-water lakes in Ireland. The&s;e i&s;lands have never been &s;ettled on: yet appear to be very fruitful, and mu&s;t be a mo&s;t delightful re&s;idence in &s;um|mer, except for the want of fre&s;h water; which, perhaps, may be the rea&s;on they have never been inhabited. Had the lake been properly frozen, we might have &s;aved our&s;elves the trouble of travelling &s;everal leagues, by cro&s;&s;ing over from point to point, and from one i&s;land to another: but, this not being the ca&s;e, we were obliged to travel round the greate&s;t part of the bays on one &s;ide of it.</P>
<P>On the 20th, we arrived at a place called St. Peter's, where there are four or five French and Engli&s;h families &s;ettled. I was here received very politely, and entertained at the hou&s;e of a Mr. Cavanaugh, a merchant, who was &s;o good as to take my draught for two hundred pounds upon my father, though I was a perfect &s;tranger to him. To this harbour ve&s;&s;els of the greate&s;t burthen can come with &s;afety, and a con&s;idera|ble fi&s;hery was formerly carried on here, till, on the breaking out of the pre&s;ent war, the Ame|rican privateers put a &s;top to it. The force of the&s;e privateers, even taken collectively, is but trifling; and it is much to be regretted, that go|vernment
<PB N="73" REF="045437_0405_102029B1ED0AB360">
cannot &s;pare a ve&s;&s;el or two of force, to cruize about here, and protect the fi&s;heries; which, together with &s;ome other branches of trade, might be carried on with as much vigour, and much more benefit, than before the war. This Mr. Cavanaugh, but a &s;hort time before I arrived, was plundered, to the amount of three thou&s;and pounds, by two privateers from Bo&s;ton; who came in at their lei&s;ure, and took what they wanted out of his &s;tores. The&s;e American pri|vateers have likewi&s;e driven all the &s;ettlers away from Loui&s;burg, who had al&s;o &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by the fi&s;hery; and it is &s;omewhat remarkable, that this place, which was, during the two la&s;t wars, &s;uch a bone of contention between us and the French, has not, at the pre&s;ent moment, &s;o much as a &s;ingle inhabitant.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have taken a &s;hallop or fi&s;hing-boat from this place, and gone to Halifax by &s;ea, but that there was almo&s;t a certainty of being taken by &s;ome privateer along the coa&s;t. This lake, St. Peter, is but half a mile from the ocean; to which, we were to carry our canoe through the woods, and to proceed, by water, to the gut of Canceau. While the French were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land, they had formed a de&s;ign of cutting through this narrow neck of land, and opening a communication on that &s;ide, between the ocean and the lake, in order to bring in their large &s;hips of war, to lie during the winter, in the lake of St. Peter; for there is a &s;ufficient depth of water in the harbour of St. Peter, for the large&s;t &s;hips of the line to ride in, though there is not water enough in the inlet, by which the
<PB N="74" REF="045437_0406_102029B37B510730">
lake communicates with the ocean, to enable them to pa&s;s up to the harbour.</P>
<P>After &s;tocking our&s;elves, therefore, with as much provi&s;ions, and other nece&s;&s;aries, as we had occa&s;ion for, we &s;at off, on the 22d, in our bark canoe, and arrived the &s;ame day at a place called by the French, Grand Grave; where there is a family or two of that nation. The wind blow|ing hard, we were obliged to remain here all night; and, on the 23d, proceeded along the coa&s;t to a &s;ettlement called Di&s;cou&s;&s;e, where we were detained another day, by &s;ome floating ice.</P>
<P>On the 25th, we got to a place called Nar|ra&s;hoc; where we were as ho&s;pitably entertai|ned as we had been at St. Peter's. I here ex|changed the remains of my regimental coat, for a brown &s;uit of clothes, intending to pa&s;s for the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip, in ca&s;e I &s;hould happen to be taken by any of the American privateers at Canceau; and as the inhabitants of this place gave me to under&s;tand, that the people of Can|ceau were very much di&s;affected to government, I took every precaution to di&s;gui&s;e the appear|ance of an officer.</P>
<P>We proceeded in our canoe, on the 26th, to the point of I&s;le-Madame; intending to cro&s;s the great pa&s;&s;age of Canceau. This pa&s;&s;age is called the Gut of Canceau, from an Acadian &s;ettlement of that name on the continent; and &s;eparates the I&s;land of Cape-Breton from Aca|dia, or, as it is now called by the Engli&s;h, No|va-Scotia. The i&s;land of Madame lies in the middle of the Gut, but rather nearer to Cape-Breton
<PB N="75" REF="045437_0407_102029B673405C80">
than to the main; and the pa&s;&s;age to this i&s;land is called the Small, that from the I&s;land to Canceau, the Great Pa&s;&s;age. On mak|ing the point of I&s;le-Madame, we found that there was &s;till a great quantity of floating ice in the Great Pa&s;&s;age, and, not thinking it prudent to venture in our frail ve&s;&s;el among it, we re|turned to Narra&s;hoc, in order to procure a &s;mall &s;loop or ve&s;&s;el that could re&s;i&s;t the ice.</P>
<P>Having accordingly provided one, we embar|ked our little canoe in it, and, on the 27th, the wind being as favourable as we could wi&s;h, got acro&s;s the pa&s;&s;age, which is eight leagues, in three hours. The men, who navigated the ve&s;|&s;el to the other &s;ide, were very apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome American privateers lying in the harbour of Canceau, having &s;een &s;everal is the bay two days before. Upon this intelligence, I gave my di&s;patches and papers to one of the Indians, knowing well, that they never attempt to &s;earch or plunder any of the&s;e people. We were, how|ever, &s;o fortunate, as to &s;ee no privateers on en|tering the harbour.</P>
<P>On landing at Canceau, I went to the hou&s;e of a Mr. Ru&s;t, who is the principal man at this place, and acts as a ju&s;tice of the peace under go|vernment for which he receives about 100<HI>l. per annum.</HI> The inhabitants on the other &s;ide, as well as the people who brought us over, having informed me, that this gentleman always &s;upplied the New-England-cruizers with every nece&s;&s;ary that his &s;tores could afford; I was determined, to be very cautious in every thing I &s;aid, in his pre|&s;ence. Having paid the per&s;on who brought us
<PB N="76" REF="045437_0408_102029BAC64D8A68">
over the gut, and thanked him for his private intelligence, I was conducted to the hou&s;e of this Mr. Ru&s;t, to whom I pa&s;&s;ed my&s;elf for the captain of the &s;hip. He a&s;ked me a number of que&s;tions, the tendency of which I could ea&s;ily perceive; and therefore, gave him as eva&s;ive an|&s;wers as po&s;&s;ible. I found that he had a brother-in-law, who was a fir&s;t-lieutenant on board a &s;ixteen-gun-brig, belonging to Bo&s;ton, which had gone out of the harbour of Canceau the day before.</P>
<P>We remained in this place till three o'clock the next morning, when, being apprehen&s;ive of treachery, on the part of our pretended friends; we &s;at off, without any intimation of it to Mr. Ru&s;t. Prom this gentleman I had purcha&s;ed a piece of &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> pork, and about eight pounds of bi&s;cuit, which he &s;aid was as much as he could &s;pare, and for which, I was obliged to pay him at lea&s;t thrice its value. We were now to proceed in our canoe, along the coa&s;t to Halifax, and had rea&s;on to fear that we &s;hould be again di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for provi&s;ions. However, we were &s;o lucky as to find, as we coa&s;ted along, plenty of lob&s;ters and other fi&s;h, which the Indians caught with prodigious dexterity, killing the flat fi&s;h with a pointed pole, and the lob&s;ters with a cloven one. We were ten days going from Canceau to Hali|fax: during which interval, we did not meet with any &s;ettlement, and &s;aw nothing worth mention|ing, except a number of picaroons on various parts of the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Indians remained, for a few days, at Ha|lifax; when, having received the balance due to
<PB N="77" REF="045437_0409_102029BC50ABCE98">
them, they took their departure for the i&s;land. I was obliged to continue here for two months longer, till an opportunity &s;erved for a pa&s;&s;age in the Royal-Oak, to New-York; where I deliver|ed my di&s;patches (in a very ragged condition) to Sir Henry Clinton.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of my fellow-&s;ufferers in the &s;hip|wreck, &s;oon after arrived at Halifax, in a &s;hallop from Spani&s;h-River. The captain, con&s;cious of the reception he would meet with, did not think proper to go to his owner at New-York, to give an account of the lo&s;s of his ve&s;&s;el; but took his pa&s;&s;age in a &s;hip from Halifax to London, and now &s;erves as a pilot on the Thames. The mate was, on account of his good conduct du|ring the whole of our tran&s;actions, appointed, by a gentleman in Halifax, to the command of a &s;hip bound to the We&s;t-Indies.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR EMILY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVE you then forgotten your promi&s;e to come down to the country, and &s;pend a few days with me in the beginning of &s;pring? Perhaps the fine folks in town, do not &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;pring is come yet. I can account for their mi&s;take. Nothing but the &s;un can con|vince them of its approach; and they keep them&s;elves &s;o mewed up in their apartments, that they think very little of con&s;ulting him. As for us, we enjoy his kindly beams already. The country, which was &s;o dull for &s;ome months, has rea&s;&s;umed all its charms. The trees, have &s;haken off winter's &s;qualid dre&s;s; to put on, once more, the livery of the &s;pring. The birds, returning in crowds, form the mo&s;t agreeable concerts; while they hide their ne&s;ts under the thick foli|age of the groves. What can you be doing in town? Were you to pa&s;s the whole day at your window, breathing the fre&s;h air, would you &s;up|po&s;e that you enjoyed the &s;pring? Ca&s;t your eyes round you, what do you &s;ee? A &s;ky clouded with &s;moke, dirty &s;treets; in &s;hort, the &s;ame ob|jects that you have &s;een all the winter. The

hou&s;e-tops, it is true, are no longer covered with &s;now and icicles, but your dun tiles, even with this advantage, afford no very brilliant pro&s;pect. Do you &s;ee, as I do, the &s;un's ri&s;ing beams deck the fre&s;h leaf with purple and gold; do you &s;ee the dew-drops &s;hine like pearls, before his warmth dries them up; do you &s;ee him, when he emerges from behind the hill, inundate the va&s;t horizon with a torrent of light? I &s;uppo&s;e your town idlers, who have &s;tuck &s;o long to their fire-&s;ides, begin to tru&s;t them&s;elves, at length, to the park, though they &s;till &s;hudder with the cold that they have felt; but look at them attentive|ly, you will find that one winter has made them old. Here, on the contrary, every thing &s;eems to have grown young again. The brooks have purged their muddy waters; the meadows are enamelled with new flowers; the pale primro&s;e adorns every bank; and even the prickly haw|thorn, prepares to dre&s;s it&s;elf in the blo&s;&s;oms of May, in order to &s;often its rugged a&s;pect. How plea&s;ing, after the dull &s;ilence that reigned through all nature, to hear the bleating of the flocks, that are &s;een climbing up the green &s;lopes; and the clamorous joy of the children and youth, who come out to enjoy their accu&s;tomed &s;ports in the fields. Our hou&s;e is built upon an emi|nence, expo&s;ed to the earlie&s;t beams of the &s;un. I might, if I cho&s;e, receive his morning vi&s;its in my chamber; but I like better to ri&s;e with the dawn, and pay him my re&s;pects in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon the top of the hill; and thither I repair in the evening al&s;o, to take my leave of him.</P>

The&s;e, my dear Emily, are &s;ome of the plea|&s;ures that the country affords; but, I feel the want of a friend to enjoy them with me. Make ha&s;te, therefore, and come down. Do not &s;up|po&s;e, that whatever time you &s;pend here, will be lo&s;t to your improvement: I learn here a thou|&s;and things, of which I am a&s;hamed that I have hitherto been ignorant. Our little accompli&s;h|ments too, I am very &s;ure, will not contract ru&s;t in this air. The &s;weet &s;ongs of the nightingale will remind us of cultivating our voices more attentively. The little lambs, that bound and fri&s;k round their mothers, will give us an exam|ple of ea&s;e, grace, and agility; while the land|&s;cape, varying before us at every &s;tep, will in|vite us, to exerci&s;e our pencils, and vie with the colouring of nature: &s;uch rivals as the&s;e, may, perhaps, humble our vanity, but they take no pride to them&s;elves, from our inferiority; and therefore, we can forgive their excelling us. Try to prevail upon your mama to come down along with you: we expect you both, with the mo&s;t earne&s;t impatience. Adieu, my dear Emily. The moment, that I can &s;uppo&s;e my letter to have reached you, I will go and po&s;t my&s;elf at the end of our avenue, to wait your coming. You will do wrong, to let me moan there long, like the turtle for its ab&s;ent mate. Once more, adieu. Believe me unalterable in the friend&s;hip which I have vowed to maintain for you, while I re|main.</P>

<P>I HAVE not forgotten the promi&s;e that you mention, my dear Julia, and if I have not per|formed it, I am pretty &s;ure, when you hear the rea&s;on, you will not think me de&s;erving of your reproaches. I cho&s;e rather to appear de&s;erving of them, than to wound your tender brea&s;t with my &s;orrows. The&s;e I can now impart to you, as they are at pre&s;ent totally di&s;&s;ipated. You know how tenderly I love my worthy mother. Well, my dear friend, I have been upon the point of lo&s;ing her for ever; and &s;hudder &s;till at the thoughts of my danger. Since the death of my papa, her health had been con&s;tantly on the decline; but I flattered my&s;elf, that the amu&s;e|ments of the country, your mama's agreeable company, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing me happy in your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> might in &s;ome mea&s;ure divert her grief, and contribute to the recovery of her health. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this hope, that made me talk la&s;t winter, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ch high &s;pirits, of the plea&s;ures that we were to enjoy in the &s;pring. The fir&s;t approaches of this charming &s;ea&s;on revived in my mind the mo&s;t delicious ideas. I was bu&s;y, the other day, preparing for our jaunt; and mama,
<PB N="82" REF="045437_0414_102029CDDA131450">
with her u&s;ual good nature, &s;eeing my impati|ence, was as earne&s;t on her part, where, as &s;he was packing up her things, a bundle of letters of my father's, which &s;he has always pre&s;erved, fell into her hands. It was late in the evening; &s;he therefore &s;ent me to bed, that &s;he might peru&s;e them more at her ea&s;e. I have &s;ince learned that &s;he was reading them the whole night. They mu&s;t have agitated her &s;pirits mo&s;t powerfully; for, in the morning, a fever ap|peared on her in all its violence, and reduced her in two days to the la&s;t extremity. Judge what I mu&s;t have &s;uffered in &s;eeing her delirious the whole time, and hearing her pronounce my papa's dear name with a voice &s;carcely audible. I trembled, every moment, le&s;t I &s;hould lo&s;e her as well as him. What would have become of me, deprived of that dear mother, who &s;eems to care for life on no other account than that of her affection for me? I had ever been &s;en&s;ible of her fondne&s;s, but at that moment how much did I feel my love and gratitude increa&s;e! Al|though her &s;ituation rendered her uncon&s;cious of my care and tenderne&s;s, yet, I exerted my&s;elf in the melancholy office, as much, as if &s;he had re|paid me by her fonde&s;t care&s;&s;es. My father, who&s;e image was &s;o &s;trongly painted in my re|membrance, &s;eemed to thank me for her. I never left her bed-&s;ide a &s;ingle moment, and I have now the plea&s;ure to &s;ee her recover per|ceptibly. I cannot expre&s;s to you, what new &s;entiments this revolution in my mother's health has given birth to, in my brea&s;t. The names of mother and daughter, &s;ound in my ears with a
<PB N="83" REF="045437_0415_102029CF6245ED00">
&s;weetne&s;s, that I never found in them before. Whatever reminds me of the tender ties of na|ture, excites in my &s;oul more melting emotions than I have ever hitherto experienced. Of this I had a proof ye&s;terday, which I &s;hall long re|member.</P>
<P>Mama took me, to &s;pend a day out of town, at Lady D&mdash;'s, who had te&s;tified the &s;tronge&s;t concern for her, during her illne&s;s. I had al|ways heard this lady mentioned, with ex|pre&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect and affection, but my age's levity had hindered me, from making remarks upon her character with any attention. I now re&s;olved, however, to &s;tudy it ob&s;ervantly. We found her at our arrival, in a company of near twenty vi&s;itors; &s;ome of whom, were united to her, by the ties of friend&s;hip, others, common acquaintances, who had occa&s;ionally, matters of bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act with her hu&s;band. Her countenance, which was con&s;tantly brightened with a &s;mile of candor and good nature, en|couraged even &s;trangers to be at their ea&s;e, in her company. I admired, with what ea&s;e &s;he could addre&s;s all by turns, in the very &s;tyle which their &s;everal circum&s;tances made the propere&s;t, forgetting no per&s;on in &s;o numerous a company, and yet, in the mid&s;t of all the&s;e various atten|tions, overlooking her young family with the care of a mother, though &s;he did not appear in the lea&s;t engaged with them. In the evening, when the company was retired, mama yielded to the reque&s;t of her friend, who pre&s;&s;ingly entreat|ed her, to prolong the plea&s;ure that &s;he enjoyed, in being once more in her &s;ociety. Lady D&mdash;
<PB N="84" REF="045437_0416_102029D14E9B8468">
had ju&s;t received agreeable news, from two of her &s;ons, who were on their travels. Her hu&s;band was returned the &s;ame day, from a &s;hort journey into the country. The&s;e two circum&s;tances, threw her into a mo&s;t delicious frame of mind; and her happine&s;s, was equally painted in the &s;mile that hung upon her lips, and in the &s;weet drops that bedewed her eyes. It &s;eemed, as if her &s;oul, replete with love, feared to contract her joy within her&s;elf, and would therefore dif|fu&s;e it upon all around, to make them partners in her happine&s;s. The impre&s;&s;ion was &s;o plea&s;|ing, that you could not avoid cheri&s;hing it, as your own proper &s;en&s;ation. Her feelings had the &s;ame effect, as a fine evening, in which, nature, takes plea&s;ure to breathe into every bo&s;om, the &s;weets that &s;he di&s;pen&s;es. A light and lively chearfulne&s;s, quickly &s;ucceeded to this tender mood, and from that air of noblene&s;s, that character of dignity and good &s;en&s;e, which was to her &s;o natural, and which &s;he had &s;upported, to &s;o much advantage, in the general conver|&s;ation of the afternoon, I &s;aw her with the &s;ame grace, de&s;cend to the mo&s;t playful good humour, and the mo&s;t intimate familiarity. Mama was touched with the affectionate part, that &s;he took concerning the happy return of her health; I confe&s;s, I my&s;elf was touched with the flattering in&s;tances of friend&s;hip, that I received from her lips; but I know not how, &s;he found the &s;ecret of making her own plea&s;ure, become &s;till more &s;en&s;ibly intere&s;ting to us. Sometimes, by care&s;&s;es, &s;he would encourage her daughter, to di&s;play before her father, the accompli&s;hments, which
<PB N="85" REF="045437_0417_102029D442105DB8">
&s;he had acquired in his ab&s;ence: &s;ometimes by ingeniou&s;ly irritating her, as it were, &s;he would elicit from her daughter's vivacity a thou&s;and &s;trokes of native wit and delicacy. Amiable artifice of maternal tenderne&s;s, that endeavoure&s;t to adorn children, in all their graces, before the eyes of a delighted father, in order to render him, in his turn, more dear to his children, by the increa&s;e of his affection! How well did&s;t thou become that pure, ingenuous &s;oul, which was &s;o much a &s;tranger to artifice of every other kind!</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the evening, was &s;pent in a varie|ty of little amu&s;ements, and I entered into the &s;pirit of them more, I think, than I &s;hould have done, in any other hou&s;e, becau&s;e they generally appear, to be no other than expedients, to be|guile the weari&s;ome time away, whereas the chearfulne&s;s, &s;pirit and cordiality, with which they are &s;ea&s;oned by Lady D&mdash;, renders them real and genuine plea&s;ures. At length, however, the moment of our departure arrived, and I con|fe&s;s to you, not without co&s;ting me a very lively regret. We had hardly been &s;eated in the car|riage, when, deare&s;t mama, cried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, throwing my arms round her neck, how much do I thank you, for having made me a witne&s;s, to the hap|pine&s;s of that re&s;pectable family! I know, I &s;hall love you &s;till more for it, than ever I have. You &s;ee, my Emily, an&s;wered &s;he, pre&s;&s;ing me tender|ly to her bo&s;om, how much the &s;weets of nature and of friend&s;hip, excel all other plea&s;ures. My heart felt the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion, and ever does, when I am in the company of my worthy friend.
<PB N="86" REF="045437_0418_102029D89D693878">
I never leave her, but I find my&s;elf more inclined to practi&s;e my duty, and better in&s;tructed by her example, in the means of &s;ucceeding. Ah, mama, how delightful are tho&s;e duties, and how ea&s;y do they appear, from the manner in which Lady D&mdash;performs them. I think, to be in her company one &s;ingle day, would be a &s;ufficient inducement to any woman upon earth, to &s;eek the &s;ame happine&s;s. You are right, my dear, &s;uch is the charm of true virtue, that at &s;ight of her, all ingenuous &s;ouls feel the mo&s;t willing in|clination, to follow her example. But many are &s;oon di&s;heartened by &s;ome difficulties, which wear a formidable a&s;pect, and this merely for want of a &s;ufficient &s;teadine&s;s of principle. Lady D&mdash;, had the courage, to form her principles in her earlie&s;t youth, and never to &s;werve from them, during the re&s;t of her life. With all the plea&s;ing qualities and accompli&s;hments, that were capable of making her &s;hine in the world; a fortune, &s;ufficient to &s;upply even thoughtle&s;s di&s;&s;ipation; and, in &s;pite of the examples which &s;he might have pleaded in her excu&s;e, &s;he was early &s;en&s;ible that her own e&s;teem, that of her hu&s;band, her family, and her friends, were of more &s;olid value to &s;uch a mind as her's. All her thoughts, all her actions, have been directed by this virtuous determination. Her efforts be|came every day ea&s;ier to her, and the &s;ucce&s;s of them was the beginning of her reward. The more &s;he has ta&s;ted the happine&s;s of this reward, the more lively dread &s;he has felt of lo&s;ing it, were &s;he to deviate a &s;ingle moment from her plan of rectitude. Hence her courage has never
<PB N="87" REF="045437_0419_102029DB90AAD498">
been daunted at any difficulty. All her children have been brought up at her own brea&s;t. They have never been &s;ick, but her embrace con&s;oled them. She formed their earlie&s;t ideas, their ear|lie&s;t &s;entiments; &s;he has ince&s;&s;antly watched over the minute&s;t particulars of their education; and even at this day, their happine&s;s is her only &s;oli|citude: to that, her generous affection would &s;a|crifice the deare&s;t con&s;iderations of her own hap|pine&s;s; and, from the calm, in which &s;o many &s;ubjects of inward &s;atisfaction &s;u&s;tain her mind, in the mid&s;t of all its activity, proceeds that air of &s;erenity and chearfulne&s;s, that candid ingenu|ous manner, which gains your e&s;teem at the fir&s;t look. Being, therefore, always certain of meet|ing with good will and re&s;pect from others, as &s;he finds nothing in her&s;elf unworthy of the&s;e &s;entiments, &s;he needs only to pur&s;ue the natural bent of her di&s;po&s;ition, in order to be &s;ure of plea&s;ing: and to the&s;e means of plea&s;ing, with which nature has endowed her, &s;he has united all tho&s;e that are in the gift of rea&s;on, cultivated by reflection, reading and experience. It &s;eems, as if nothing were beyond the reach of her fa|culties, in the &s;ame manner as there is nothing which her feelings do not intere&s;t. Her conver|&s;ation is as touching as in&s;tructive. One would &s;ay, that all her ideas pa&s;s by her heart, and there clothe them&s;elves in the expre&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t noble and delicate &s;entiment. An unalter|able equality of temper, an amiablene&s;s ever new, bind her hu&s;band's affections to her in the &s;weete&s;t captivity, nor ever allow him to wi&s;h for other relaxation from his cares, than he finds in
<PB N="88" REF="045437_0420_102029DD1AA0F888">
her company. In effect, what &s;ight can he find, when from home, capable of engaging him &s;o much as his own hou&s;e; when he &s;ees his friends, fatigued amid the bu&s;tling &s;cenes of the world, come to this a&s;ylum of peace and honour, to &s;eek the plea&s;ure which tho&s;e &s;cenes could not afford them? The air of frankne&s;s and becom|ing liberty that you find in this hou&s;e, di&s;po&s;es all hearts to become &s;u&s;ceptible of generous &s;en|timents, and &s;till farther to open them&s;elves with the mo&s;t unre&s;erved confidence. You are there &s;afe both again&s;t others and your&s;elf, as in a tem|ple, where every thing in&s;pires the re&s;pect and love of a beneficent Deity, whom we &s;hould dread to offend even in our mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts. In&s;tead of the jealou&s;ies and claims of precedence which rai&s;e di&s;cord among other women, tho&s;e whom &s;he has cho&s;en for her acquaintance, only feel, in her pre&s;ence, the de&s;ire of meriting her e&s;teem daily more and more; and this, being equally the bu&s;ine&s;s of all, attaches them to each other by new ties, and leads them to offer her their united tribute of gratitude and friend&s;hip: thus every thing con&s;pires, to afford her the &s;u|blime&s;t happine&s;s that a &s;oul, endowed with &s;en|&s;ibility, can ta&s;te.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the vivacity with which my mother delivered me this portrait of Lady D&mdash;, it made &s;o powerful an impre&s;&s;ion on me, that I

have found it again this morning, quite fre&s;h in my memory. I ha&s;ten to &s;end it to you, re|que&s;ting you, at the &s;ame time, to &s;hew it to your mother. I confe&s;s to you, I &s;hould be happy to &s;ee it in the hands of all hone&s;t peo|ple. Nay, I think, we owe this public homage to virtue, that we &s;hould paint the plea&s;ures which it be&s;tows, both in order to encourage tho&s;e who practi&s;e it, and to invite others to do &s;o by the hopes of the &s;ame happine&s;s. The only per&s;on from whom I &s;hould wi&s;h to conceal it, is, my Lady D&mdash;her&s;elf, and that for fear of offending her mode&s;ty; if, after all, this very quality would permit her to di&s;cover her own re&s;emblance in the picture. Her friends alone would be &s;truck with the likene&s;s, and would thank me for having <HI>given</HI> them <HI>back the image</HI> of tho&s;e &s;entiments which they all entertain of her in their hearts. Hone&s;t people, in general, would applaud me for having &s;hewed by a liv|ing pattern, that virtue is not a &s;tranger upon earth: that it may be allied to the mo&s;t amiable character, and enjoy the pure&s;t bli&s;s that the con|dition of humanity is capable of ta&s;ting.</P>
<P>Let us, my dear friend, who have the happi|ne&s;s to find the &s;ame principles in our parents, profit by this new example, and be &s;till further animated to tread in their &s;teps.

<P>AFTER having laboured &s;o hard during the be&s;t part of our lives, thus at la&s;t to fall into poverty! To what purpo&s;e is it, that we have

never cea&s;ed our cares and pains for a &s;ingle mo|ment, in order to breed up our children with credit? If they were but of an age to earn their own bread, it would be &s;omething! My dear children, it is not for my&s;elf, it is for you that I &s;hed tears; in lo&s;ing our cattle we have lo&s;t our all. What remains, is far from being &s;ufficient to pay our landlord. What is to become of us? if my good hu&s;band did not &s;upport my &s;inking courage, I &s;hould die with grief. But how wor|thy a character he is! What a man! How tran|quil, in the mid&s;t of our misfortunes! Were I not &s;ure, that affection makes him conceal the greate&s;t part of his troubles, from the fear of af|flicting me, I &s;hould believe he were in&s;en&s;ible to them. "Why do&s;t thou weep, Martha, he often &s;ays, when I can no longer re&s;train my tears? We have had a lo&s;s, it is true; but who knows what Providence has in &s;tore for us! I, for my part, make that my dependence." Alas, though never rich him&s;elf, he was always a friend to the unfortunate. How many families in this village has he &s;aved from mi&s;ery, by his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance! There is not a better man on earth; and I &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s what many women want in the mid&s;t of riches, a worthy hu&s;band, and children, who&s;e good di&s;po&s;itions fill our hearts with joy. Whil&s;t I think on the&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings, I feel that Providence watches over us, and my griefs become lighter. Take courage then, Martha, enough is left to con&s;ole thee in thy affliction. <STAGE>(She advances to the door, and calls)</STAGE> Jenny, Jenny.</P>

Very bad, an&s;wered I: I have lo&s;t all my cattle, in the &s;pace of eight days; by a di&s;ea&s;e, brought on by the drought of the &s;ea&s;on. I am ruined, and I am come to inform you of it, that you may be at liberty to let your farm to another tenant. I come al&s;o to offer you all that I have left in the world: it is a great trouble to me, that I have not &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy you; but I promi&s;e, on the word of an hone&s;t man, to labour night and day, till I can do &s;o. I &s;hall eat of the bread of bitterne&s;s till I have paid my debt, to the utmo&s;t farthing.</P>

<P>I was already acquainted with your lo&s;&s;es, hone&s;t Thorowgood, &s;aid he, and am heartily &s;orry for them. I pity you al&s;o, &s;aid madam, with her &s;weet voice: I pity you with all my heart.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not come here, &s;aid I, to excite compa&s;&s;ion, I have no occa&s;ion for it, as I am able to work. My great concern is, that I cannot acquit my&s;elf of my debts to you: I own, I feel for my wife and my young family: I, who would have &s;hed my blood to pre&s;erve them from want! You who are rich, and without children, know not what it is to &s;ee tho&s;e &s;uffer to whom we have given life. Ah, if you had &s;uch children as I have; if you loved them with all your &s;oul, and were beloved by them as I am! In &s;aying this, grief made me hide my face; and when I lifted up my eyes again, I &s;aw Mr. Parks was no longer looking at me: he had turned toward his wife; their eyes were filled with tears, and fixed on each other. Pity was not the only &s;entiment which then affected them; I plainly &s;aw, that &s;omething, which more nearly concerned them&s;elves, occupied their minds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you not a&s;k them what it was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had not the courage; but as I continued to talk of my children, Mr. Parks &s;trove to change the di&s;cour&s;e. I perceived clearly that &s;ome private affliction was the cau&s;e of this; and therefore, ha&s;tened to quit the &s;ub|ject.

<P>Quite the contrary; he bid me not de&s;pair. Go home to your wife, &s;aid the good gentleman, I will order my hor&s;e, and be with you pre&s;ently, when we will &s;ettle every thing.

You mu&s;t know, ju&s;t before the di&s;order appeared, we had made a joint purcha&s;e of twelve cows at a neighbouring fair. It is true, I advanced two-thirds of the money; but upon his con&s;enting to graze them, for a certain time on his farm, (which was an excellent bargain for him, in point of money, as we &s;ettled it) I told him that, whatever of the herd &s;hould e&s;cape the mortality, we would divide equally between us. At that time I had no rea&s;on to think, that this arrangement would turn out in my favour; and now, though it has, I &s;hould be far from taking advantage of it, if it regarded my&s;elf alone; but I am no longer ma&s;ter of my own.

To cut the matter &s;hort, I cannot pay you the debt in ready money: I re&s;ign therefore all my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, without injury to your remaining claim, which I will pay, that I will, you may depend; you &s;hall be next in con&s;ideration after the immediate nece&s;&s;aries of life are &s;upplied.</P>

<P>It is a melancholy &s;tory: we then lived in the north of England; I rented a little farm there, on the banks of a river; it was an excellent &s;ituation, and the land yielded abun|dantly; no thanks to the care of the former ten|ant, though&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, to come to the point at once: you mu&s;t know, that one night we were rou&s;ed from our &s;leep, by the water's ru&s;hing in|to our hou&s;e on all &s;ides; we had hardly time to get upon the roof, to wait for relief there; in the morning, a boat came to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance: the whole country was under water; the river was covered with the ruins of hou&s;es and furniture,
<PB N="175" REF="045437_0507_101FFDBFB24B2710">
carried away by the force of the current. I was endeavouring to comfort my wife, who lament|ed the lo&s;s of our cottage, but &s;till more that of her &s;on, who was &s;tifled in the water before we awoke; in the mean time, I &s;uddenly perceived a cradle, to&s;&s;ed about in the flood, which was running rapidly, and threatening every moment to &s;wallow it up. I could not bear the fight: I threw off my clothes, and, regardle&s;s of danger, I plunged into the river, &s;wimming with all my might towards the cradle. I was driven back &s;e|veral times, and almo&s;t exhau&s;ted with fatigue; but the cries of the child, which I heard as I ap|proached, in&s;pired me with fre&s;h &s;pirits and vi|gour: in &s;hort, after much difficulty and dan|ger, I got up to it, and brought it to the bank, a good way lower down. My wife followed me, creeping, more dead than alive, along the &s;ide of the river. I pre&s;ented the infant to her, which continued crying, until &s;he gave it the brea&s;t. Poor Martha fancied that &s;he had recovered her lo&s;t child. We then made all po&s;&s;ible enquiries to &s;ee if we could di&s;cover the parents, but we never could get any information: our affliction at length cea&s;ed; we continued to look upon him as our own &s;on. I have related the whole &s;tory to the boy him&s;elf, a hundred time: I con|cealed it, indeed, from my own children, to let them enjoy the plea&s;ure of thinking him their brother, and to avoid all occa&s;ion of jealou&s;y. I have had him in&s;tructed like the re&s;t. He does his work, as well, as I can my&s;elf.

<P>Mo&s;t willingly, my friend, as the recital can no longer di&s;tre&s;s me: I had been married a year, when a war broke out, and I received orders to proceed with my regiment to the We&s;t-Indies: my wife, notwith&s;tanding all entreaties, would accompany me in that long and dangerous voyage, after giving birth to this dear boy, the only one that we have left. I had an uncle, a dignitary of the church, who lived near Durham; the infant was con&s;igned to a nur&s;e in his neighbourhood, that he might have an eye to him, and give us information about him. I received no account the three fir&s;t years of my ab&s;ence. Unea&s;y at &s;o long a &s;ilence. I wrote to &s;ome friends in London: the mo&s;t zealous of them vi&s;ited the place, whence he acquainted me, that &s;oon after my departure, a &s;udden inundation had ravaged the country, that my uncle, had fallen a victim to his intrepid exertions, on that calamitous occa&s;ion: that the hou&s;e of the nur&s;e, had been &s;wept away by the flood, and that my &s;on peri&s;hed with her; this dreadful news oppre&s;&s;ed me with &s;orrow, and

<HEAD>ANTHONY AND HIS DOG.</HEAD>
<P>ANTHONY was the &s;on of a poor labour|er, a very hone&s;t man, but &s;o extremely poor, that he &s;carcely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any thing in the world be&s;ides the few tools of hu&s;bandry, with which he earned a mi&s;erable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. His wife was lately dead, after a lingering illne&s;s, which had been the ruin of his affairs. The grief that he felt on this occa&s;ion, would have broken his heart, had he not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the con|&s;olation of having &s;till an only &s;on, whom he lo|ved exceedingly, as the child was gentle and &s;in|cere, and in every re&s;pect endowed with the mo&s;t amiable and happy di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Young Anthony was pa&s;&s;ing one day before the door of a gentleman's hou&s;e, when a &s;ervant perceiving him, called him into the court-yard, and a&s;ked him, if he was di&s;po&s;ed to earn &s;ix|pence. Yes, with all my heart, an&s;wered the poor child: What mu&s;t I do for that?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t take one of our dogs, put a &s;tone round his neck, and throw him into the river.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor thing! why do you want to kill him? Has he bit any body?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="195" REF="045437_0527_101FFF6C4F4076F8">
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that is not the ca&s;e: you &s;hall &s;ee the rea&s;on pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he conducted Anthony into the &s;ta|ble, and &s;hewed him in a corner, lying upon a wi&s;p of &s;traw a little dog that &s;eemed ju&s;t expir|ing: his hair was all fallen off, and his whole body &s;eemed to be covered with a horrible mange.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the poor creature! He is in a very bad way indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>And for that rea&s;on, my Lady wi&s;hes to be rid of him: there are other dogs in the hou&s;e, and &s;he is afraid that they may catch his di&s;order. If you have a mind to earn your &s;ix-pence, you have only to take him and drown him. I would not touch him my&s;elf for five pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why throw him into the river? Perhaps he may be cured.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no likelihood that he will ever recover it. My lady's doctor has given him over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, no matter, &s;till one may try.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart: Do what you will with him, provided you rid us of him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;hall I have the &s;ix-pence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! you mind the main chance, I &s;ee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not a&s;k it for my&s;elf, but for the poor dog. If I was rich, I could do with|out it, but I am far from it: I have not always bread enough for my&s;elf, and he &s;hould not want while he is &s;o ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="196" REF="045437_0528_101FFF6E0A1FACC0">
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, it is a bargain: here is your &s;ix-pence.</P>
</SP>
<P>Anthony &s;aw an old ba&s;ket, that &s;eemed to be thrown carele&s;sly about the &s;table, and a&s;ked the &s;ervant to let him have it: he laid the dog in it, upon a wi&s;p of &s;traw, and ha&s;tened to his father, who was at work in a field at &s;ome di&s;tance.</P>
<P>As he went, he turned his eyes now and then on the ba&s;ket. The di&s;gu&s;ting appearance of his patient almo&s;t made him &s;ick, but at the &s;ame time it excited his pity. Poor little creature, &s;aid he, you mu&s;t be in great pain. Ah! I wi&s;h I may be &s;o lucky, as to make you well: how|ever, take my word for it, whether you live or die, I &s;hall never throw you into the river.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t care was to buy a &s;mall hot roll, of which he moi&s;tened the &s;oft part, to make it the nicer; but all that the poor dog could do, was to lick it with the tip of his tongue: however, this refre&s;hment, &s;mall as it was, &s;erved to keep up the &s;trength of the &s;ick animal, and the hopes of his little doctor.</P>
<P>Anthony's father was going to &s;cold him, for not having come out &s;ooner: but, when he learnt what it was that had detained him, in|&s;tead of being angry with his &s;on, he was de|lighted to &s;ee, that he had &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate a heart, and he ki&s;&s;ed him for his good-nature.</P>
<P>Near the field, where he was at work, there was a plea&s;ant meadow; thither, Anthony carried the little dog, &s;huddering with &s;ickne&s;s, and laid him at the foot of a tree, to ba&s;k in the &s;un. His di&s;order proceeded only from a &s;uperabundance of humours, occa&s;ioned by the great quantity
<PB N="197" REF="045437_0529_101FFF72A46D5140">
of food, with which he had been u&s;ually &s;tuffed. As &s;oon as the &s;un had revived him a little, he crawled about the meadow, &s;earching by his &s;mell, for tho&s;e herbs, which in&s;tinct pointed out to him, as proper for his cure: he had &s;carcely eaten them, before they relieved him con&s;iderably. Anthony quitted his work for a moment, to &s;ee how his dog went on: he was &s;urprized, not to find him in the place where he had &s;at him, and &s;till more rejoiced, to &s;ee him upon his legs: he took care to carry him to the &s;ame meadow, for eight or ten days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, at the end of which, the poor animal was completely recover|ed. He had never had &s;o good an appetite in his life, as then. Anthony's &s;ix-pence was long &s;ince &s;pent, in feeding him while &s;ick, but now that he &s;aw him re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in perfect health, he did not grudge to &s;hare his own bit of bread with him. He had given him the name of <HI>Bonny,</HI> and perceived with &s;atisfaction, that <HI>Bonny</HI> grew hand&s;omer every day. His eyes, before &s;o dull and languid, now &s;parkled with new life: his limbs recovered their u&s;ual nimblene&s;s, and very &s;oon his coat became as &s;leek, and as &s;oft as velvet, and withal as white as the &s;now, when its virgin hue is heightened, by the dazzling beams of the &s;un.</P>
<P>The lady, to whom he had originally belonged, did not fail to hear very &s;oon of his recovery and re&s;tored beauty: &s;he &s;ent her footman to offer Anthony two guineas, if he would let her have him again. Oh! no, replied Anthony, to the me&s;&s;enger; my lady would &s;entence him, to be thrown into the river again, if he &s;hould
<PB N="198" REF="045437_0530_101FFF75275E04A8">
happen to fall &s;ick, but I will never for&s;ake him. What are your two guineas, in compari&s;on to the plea&s;ure that I have, in &s;eeing him faithful and affectionate to me? We are too fond of each other ever to part. Anthony was in the right. He would not have given his dog for an empire, but in return, his dog would not have quitted him, for the greate&s;t monarch upon earth. He con&s;tantly followed his ma&s;ter, or el&s;e fri&s;ked before him, performing a thou&s;and little gambols to amu&s;e him. Whenever An|thony after helping his father to dig, quitted his &s;pade for a moment, and &s;at down under the hedge to take a &s;light repa&s;t, he had only to make a &s;ignal, <HI>Bonny</HI> forgot all his own plea&s;ures, and ran to him full-&s;peed: there &s;tanding upon his hinder legs, and wagging his tail to expre&s;s his joy, he took from Anthony's own lips, the half of each bit of bread that he put into his mouth. Anthony, was often obliged to put up with a thou&s;and wants, but he was never a whit the &s;adder on that account; his little fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|footed-friend continued to give him new amu&s;e|ment every day, and kept him always in &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Alas! he was &s;oon to experience a great af|fliction. At the end of autumn, the little boy &s;ell dangerou&s;ly ill: his father, laid out what money he had &s;aved from his earnings, in pro|curing his &s;on the medicines, that were indi&s;pen|&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for his di&s;order. This &s;orrow|ful pittance was &s;oon exhau&s;ted; he then re|collected the con&s;iderable &s;um which had been offered Anthony, by the lady, for his dog: two guineas would be to him a trea&s;ure, in his pre&s;ent
<PB N="199" REF="045437_0531_101FFF76B0F86080">
circum&s;tances. He re&s;olved, therefore, to men|tion this propo&s;al again to his &s;on, but &s;carcely had he heard it, before he cried out, never, never; and his fever, redoubled the agitation, which &s;o painful an idea excited in his mind.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his di&s;order grew wor&s;e, every day; violent fits of the cholic came on in addition to his fever, and increa&s;ed his pains con&s;iderably. The angui&s;h that he &s;uffered, ex|torted the mo&s;t piercing cries from him, and oc|ca&s;ioned him to twi&s;t his body, and roll him&s;elf upon his wretched mat, for hours &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, his little dog would come, and crouch clo&s;e by him, and fix his eyes on him, with the mo&s;t &s;ignificant air of compa&s;&s;ion, as if he would have &s;aid, Ah! my dear ma&s;ter, I pity thee! Anthony, on the other hand, would look at him with reciprocal tenderne&s;s; and when his pains allowed him to &s;peak, My dear <HI>Bonny,</HI> he would &s;ay, I mu&s;t &s;oon leave you: Alas! I &s;aved your life, and you, poor creature, can give me no relief. Saying the&s;e words, he would &s;hed a flood of tears, which <HI>Bonny</HI> would come and lick off from his burning cheeks.</P>
<P>There lived a gentleman in the neighbour|hood, of the name of Denni&s;on, who was both very rich and very humane. This gentleman, hearing of the boy's &s;ickne&s;s, and the father's extreme poverty, came him&s;elf to vi&s;it them, in order, to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf, of the truth of the ac|counts that he had heard concerning them, and at the &s;ame time, to relieve their di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>When this excellent gentleman came to the the labourer's cottage, little Anthony was in a
<PB N="200" REF="045437_0532_101FFF78402B78E8">
mo&s;t violent fit of his di&s;order; his father &s;at clo&s;e by him, overwhelmed with grief. Hunger gave him no concern, though he had for &s;everal days before, lived upon very &s;light nouri&s;hment, barely &s;ufficient to keep him alive. The &s;ight of his &s;on's &s;ufferings, hindered him from at|tending to his own. He endeavoured to comfort him, by kind and &s;oothing words, and with his arm &s;upported the child's drooping head, while the little dog &s;tanding over him, moaned pite|ou&s;ly, and &s;trove by a thou&s;and fond tricks, to catch a look from his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Mr. Denni&s;on &s;tood &s;ome time at the cottage-door, contemplating this &s;ad picture. At length he advanced toward them, and was already at the foot of the bed, before they perceived him, or even, before the dog turned to bark at his ap|proach; and when Anthony and his father, lifted up their a&s;toni&s;hed eyes, they &s;aw his &s;wim|ming in tears.</P>
<P>My good friends, &s;aid Mr. Denni&s;on, I am &s;orry to &s;ee you in this melancholy &s;ituation: I am told, Anthony, that you are not able to furni&s;h the expence of &s;upporting your &s;on, as he &s;hould be, in his illne&s;s. That is only within the&s;e two days, an&s;wered the father: till then, I have been able to give my child bread, but now there is nothing left in this poor cabin, that I can part with for his &s;upport, unle&s;s, I &s;ell the wretched mattre&s;s, that he lies on.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, little Anthony &s;tretched out his trembling hand upon his dog, and &s;ighed heavily.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="045437_0533_101FFF7AC78504B0">
Poor child, &s;aid Mr. Denni&s;on, do not be un|ea&s;y; I will take care of you. Anthony, conti|nued he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the father, your cabin is damp, and it will do your &s;on no good to remain here while he is ill. Will you tru&s;t him with me? I will take him home with me, and have him cured. Tru&s;t him with you, Sir? Yes, that I will, and thank you for your gene|ro&s;ity. It re&s;tores both of us to life again.</P>
<P>Mr. Denni&s;on repeated his promi&s;e, and &s;queezing the little boy's hand affectionately, he took his leave, and went home to give orders for Anthony's reception. In half an hour after, came a &s;tout footman, who, wrapping up little Anthony in a good warm coverlet, carried him in his arms to Mr. Denni&s;on's hou&s;e: his father followed him, with a countenance, in which, hope and joy &s;eemed faintly endeavouring to di&s;per&s;e the long &s;ettled traces of his melancholy. As to the faithful <HI>Bonny,</HI> his countenance was fully expre&s;&s;ive of the mo&s;t unequivocal &s;atisfaction: he jumped along, with his head held up, and his eyes con&s;tantly fixed on his young ma&s;ter, who, from time to time, opened his covering a little, to have a look at him.</P>
<P>Thanks to the genero&s;ity of Mr. Denni&s;on, and the care of an able phy&s;ician, little Antho|ny's illne&s;s was &s;oon cured. During the whole time that he was confined to his bed, his faithful <HI>Bonny</HI> kept him company: it was in vain that they would invite him to take a turn in the fields, if it were only for the &s;ake of the air; he would not quit his ma&s;ter's chamber. All the ceremony that he would vouch&s;afe even to An|thony's
<PB N="202" REF="045437_0534_101FFF7F3567E000">
father, was, to attend him when he was going away, as far as the fir&s;t &s;tep of the &s;tairs; then, all at once, he wheeled about, and came &s;campering into the room, and making a thou|&s;and capers round the boy's bed.</P>
<P>At the end of a fortnight, little Anthony was able to &s;et out for his father's. Mr. Denni&s;on had given him new clothes from head to foot. Any one el&s;e would have found it difficult to know him in his new finery, but the eyes of <HI>Bonny</HI> were not to be deceived, and it may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed how great was his joy, when he &s;aw his ma&s;ter walk out to the fields, and could fri&s;k and gambol about him at his ea&s;e, once more.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t word that old Anthony &s;poke, when his &s;on came home, was the name of Mr. Den|ni&s;on. Oh! my dear child, &s;aid he, had it not been for that worthy man, I &s;hould have lo&s;t you for ever: you &s;ee how happy he has made us: What &s;hall we do to prove our gratitude to him?</P>
<P>Oh! father, I have already thought of that, but I can talk no more upon the &s;ubject at pre|&s;ent; and, &s;o &s;aying, he turned away his face, to hide the tears that gu&s;hed from his eyes.</P>
<P>He went to bed very early, yet &s;leep was a &s;tranger to his eye-lids; he did nothing but to&s;s about in his bed, and &s;igh heavily the whole night.</P>
<P>Next morning his father a&s;ked him what way he propo&s;ed to acquit his obligation to Mr. Den|ni&s;on: the poor boy had not power to an&s;wer him, but pointed with his fingers to <HI>Bonny.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="045437_0535_101FFF81B4E561C0">
He immediately put his new clothes on, and went out, but it was vi&s;ible, from the inward &s;truggles which this effort of re&s;olution co&s;t him, that his whole &s;tock of courage was exerted to put it in practice.<HI>Bonny</HI> accompanied him; he had never been &s;o playful as that day: he fri&s;ked a|bout with &s;uch &s;portive agility as to attract the looks of every pa&s;&s;enger. Many envied little Anthony the happine&s;s of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;o hand&s;ome a dog; but the more joy and vivacity he &s;hew|ed, the more was Anthony dejected and melan|choly. Ah! &s;aid he, you would not be &s;o full of &s;pirits, if you knew that we were going to part for ever: I cho&s;e rather to bear my illne&s;s, than &s;ell you to procure my&s;elf medicines; I would &s;ooner have died: but now, I mu&s;t give you up to another, unle&s;s I chu&s;e to &s;hew my&s;elf ungrateful. Ah! my poor <HI>Bonny,</HI> my poor <HI>Bon|ny!</HI></P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e melancholy reflections, he found him&s;elf before Mr. Denni&s;on's hou&s;e; he cro&s;&s;ed the court-yard, and entering, reque&s;ted admi&s;&s;ion to that gentleman, who happened to be in the parlour. While he &s;tood in the hall, his heart throbbed &s;o violently, that he was in|debted to the accidental delay of a few moments (owing to Mr. Denni&s;on's being otherwi&s;e en|gaged) for the recovery of his &s;pirits. At length being called for, he took <HI>Bonny</HI> up in his arms, and entered the parlour. Worthy Sir, cried he, at the &s;ame time &s;obbing violently, I owe you my life: I have nothing that I can offer you in return but my poor dog: here I have brought him, Sir: it is not without regret that I give him
<PB N="204" REF="045437_0536_101FFF83782058E0">
to you; but you would make me &s;till more un|happy by refu&s;ing to accept him.</P>
<P>Mr. Denni&s;on, had a heart &s;uch as all men &s;hould have, who wi&s;h their own happine&s;s, or that of their neighbours. The ingenuous di&s;|cour&s;e of the little boy made him &s;mile; but he was not the le&s;s &s;truck with the greatne&s;s of the &s;acrifice that he &s;aw him prepared to make to his gratitude. He took him therefore by the hand, and &s;aid, No, my dear Anthony, I will not re|fu&s;e you; I accept your pre&s;ent with all my heart, and e&s;teem my&s;elf fully repaid for every thing that I have done to &s;erve you: but now that we are both quit, I make you a pre&s;ent of <HI>Bonny;</HI> he is your's, in return for the &s;atisfaction that your gratitude affords me.</P>
<P>How, Sir&mdash;cried the boy, who was unable to proceed.</P>
<P>Yes, my little friend, replied Mr. Denni&s;on: but one thing I reque&s;t of you, and that is, not to in&s;i&s;t any more in oppo&s;ition to my de&s;ire: a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, I am better &s;atisfied than you can po&s;&s;ibly be, at having it in my power to make you happy once more.</P>
<P>Anthony, who the minute before had been ready to &s;woon away through the violence of his grief, was now, on the contrary, almo&s;t over|powered by his exce&s;s of joy: he viewed his be|nefactor with an air of a&s;toni&s;hment; he pre&s;&s;ed by turns, his dear <HI>Bonny</HI> and Mr. Denni&s;on's hand, which was &s;till in contact with his. He wept, but his tears were tho&s;e of joy and tender|ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="045437_0537_101FFF8627A0CE50">
Mr. Denni&s;on did not bound his kindne&s;s here. A place became vacant among his do|me&s;tics; he be&s;towed it upon old Anthony: as to his &s;on, he had him carefully educated, and gave him a good trade. <HI>Bonny</HI> lived happily in the family. Ah! &s;aid Anthony to him, &s;ome|times, when he fondled him, perhaps I owe all my happine&s;s to thee. He loved him continu|ally more and more, and, when the inhabitants of the village where he lived would &s;peak, to this day, of two good friends, the names of Antho|ny and his dog <HI>Bonny,</HI> are &s;ure to be the fir&s;t that occur on the &s;ubject.</P>

This is my rea&s;on. I &s;hould be &s;orry, while my children were young, that their teeth &s;hould grow irregularly, and &s;o be obliged to be drawn at a time when they would never have any others, to &s;ucceed them. This is a matter of &s;ome concern to a mother who loves you, but I think it &s;hould be &s;till more &s;o to you, &s;ince it touches you more nearly. The matter is no le&s;s than, whether you are to have, all your life, a &s;traggling and irregular &s;et of teeth, or neat and well ordered.

<P>It is, by not making an inef|fectual re&s;i&s;tance, but &s;ubmitting to the operation with a good grace: your brother talked of keep|ing his mouth &s;hut, if you &s;hould take it into your head to &s;hut your's al&s;o, do you think that Mr. Enamel would not find a way to open it? You may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf before-hand, that the more you would &s;truggle, the more he would be obliged to hurt you. If tears and complaints could le&s;&s;en one's pain, though they are marks of weakne&s;s, yet they would be excu&s;eable; but when they are of no u&s;e in the world, and may even contribute to make the pain wor&s;e, I think it is a great di&s;grace, and the extreme of folly, to yield to &s;uch weakne&s;&s;es.</P>

<P>Women have no le&s;s occa&s;ion for courage in &s;upporting pain: nay, perhaps, the weakne&s;s of their frame requires to be &s;trengthened with a greater degree of patience and fortitude.

I have taken early care to fortify you again&s;t the common ac|cidents of life, &s;uch as brui&s;es, or falls, or &s;trains. It is time to fortify your&s;elf again&s;t more acute pains. After all, I do not think, that on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion you will &s;uffer very much: your teeth are not firmly enough rooted to require a very violent effort to di&s;lodge them.

<P>YOUR letter, my dear &s;on, has given me the mo&s;t lively plea&s;ure. The affliction which you manife&s;t at our &s;eparation, proves to me that you have a heart of &s;en&s;ibility. The child who can bear an ab&s;ence from his mother without concern, cannot love her: we mu&s;t, neverthe|le&s;s, li&s;ten to rea&s;on. We cannot always live together; and to abandon our&s;elves without re|&s;i&s;tance to a fruitle&s;s grief, is a weakne&s;s, at which we ought to blu&s;h; learn therefore betimes to arm your&s;elf with courage again&s;t the various events of life. The mo&s;t happy lot is chequered with innumerable troubles, which we mu&s;t ac|cu&s;tom our&s;elves to bear from our earlie&s;t youth. Whenever you feel your &s;pirits dejected, becau&s;e I am not with you, you have only to think of the plea&s;ure that we &s;hall both have when we meet at the end of the year, and this thought will afford you con&s;olation: in the mean while we will write to each other as often as po&s;&s;ible. To write, is almo&s;t to &s;peak. You &s;ee by this, the benefit of tho&s;e improvements, which your diligence has acquired.

You perceive Mr. Grandi&s;on is an e&s;timable man, and wi&s;h to make him your model! You delight me, my dear child. Such a choice is the beginning of virtue.

Well, well, an&s;wered &s;he, I permit you to tell her eve|ry thing that pa&s;&s;es in our hou&s;e. I have not a dearer friend in the world than your mama. I &s;hould my&s;elf confide all my &s;ecrets with her; and I charge you to do it for me. Oh, mama, how much plea&s;ure does this permi&s;&s;ion give me! How many things &s;hall I have to tell you of my friend Charles! Yes, it is of him that I wi&s;h mo&s;t to &s;peak. You know how he abounds in under&s;tanding, in wit, in &s;entiment, in goodne&s;s: we are always together. I love him each day more than the preceding. His brother Edward, who is older by two years, is by no means &s;o a|miable; but the little Emily, their &s;i&s;ter, Oh what a charming young lady!</P>
<P>Mrs. Grandi&s;on is ju&s;t going to write to you, mama: &s;he has a&s;ked for my letter to enclo&s;e in her's. I am &s;orry that I cannot chat longer with you: methinks I &s;hould never be tired of

<P>I tenderly embrace my little &s;i&s;ter. I regret al&s;o that I have her not here to play with me; and the more, as I find that &s;he liked me &s;o well for a play-fellow.</P>

<P>WHAT obligations do I owe you, ma|dam, for having &s;ent us your &s;on! You have given me, by &s;o doing, a friend for life. If you did but know how much he delights in talk|ing of you, and with what tenderne&s;s of affecti|on he &s;peaks! He talks to me often al&s;o of his father. When he de&s;cribed his death to me, we wept together: how happy, &s;aid he to me ye&s;|terday, are you, to have &s;till a father. How much is a poor child to be pitied, who is depri|ved of his! Alas, it is to lo&s;e his deare&s;t pro|tection and be&s;t friend. How does it ever hap|pen, that there &s;hould be children in the world who di&s;obey their parents, and give them afflic|tion by their vices! For my part, had I ever gi|ven my father the lea&s;t &s;ubject of complaint, I &s;hould never more have known a day of happi|ne&s;s. But you have yet a mother, an&s;wered I. Yes, he replied, I have one who cheri&s;hes me as tenderly as I love her. She has redoubled her cares for me &s;ince the death of my father; can I therefore fail to feel for her a double portion of

re&s;pect and love? Why, am not I already grown up? I would partake with her of her labours; I would a&s;&s;i&s;t her to &s;upport her griefs. So long as I live, will I convince her, by my tenderne&s;s, that I am not unworthy of her's. I was too much moved, to be able to make any an&s;wer: I could only embrace my friend. Ah, madam, he who honours his parents &s;o truly, mu&s;t needs be a faithful friend.</P>
<P>I cannot de&s;cribe to you how diligent he is in all his &s;tudies.

I a&s;|&s;ure you, we know very well how to amu&s;e our|&s;elves; and plea&s;ure never appears &s;o agreeable to us, as after bu&s;ine&s;s. We run about in the country, we play at cricket, and at all kinds of games which require activity and addre&s;s. Our le&s;&s;ons, our exerci&s;es, and our plea&s;ures, have all their &s;tated hours; and I can a&s;&s;ure you, they are well filled up.</P>

<P>I have &s;ome melancholy news to tell you: you know young Vanberg; he is ju&s;t thrown into pri&s;on. A pa&s;&s;ion for play has been his de&s;truc|tion.

It is not long, &s;ince they paid a con&s;iderable &s;um for him, on his promi&s;e that he would play no more: but he returned to it again, and his lo&s;&s;es are enormous. There is no way left for his parents to extricate him out of his difficul|ties, but by depriving them&s;elves of bread. How unfortunate is this young man!

With what bounty, has heaven &s;upplied to you the lo&s;s which you might have &s;u&s;tained, by your mo|ther's want of means to give you tho&s;e acquire|ments &s;uited to your birth. Be grateful to your benefactors, and ever bear in mind the duty that you owe them of profiting by their bounty which you can fulfil only by your application; lo&s;e not therefore one moment: the pa&s;t hour will never return to us.

He ran to it as &s;oon as we arrived. And do you know what he has done, mamma? It is impo&s;&s;ible for any one to be more noble or generous. He has given half a guinea to the gardener who took care of his garden during his ab&s;ence. It was not nece&s;&s;ary, to be &s;ure, for him to make this pre&s;ent, as his father pays him hand&s;omely: but the man has &s;ix &s;mall children.

<HEAD>LETTER XI. WILLIAM DANVERS TO HIS MOTHER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>JUNE 25.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AH! mamma, a great misfortune has hap|pened to us. Edward has had the mis|fortune to fall into the water. He is very ill, and &s;o is Mrs. Grandi&s;on al&s;o. We are all full of grief; but you will &s;ee that Edward &s;uffers from his own fault: he is very happy in having e&s;ca|ped. Had it not been for timely help, he mu&s;t certainly have been drowned. Ye&s;terday, after dinner, not having fini&s;hed his morning ta&s;k, Mr. Grandi&s;on ordered him to &s;tay in his cham|ber to fini&s;h it: but behold his di&s;obedience! he came down, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e orders, and came after us: but I will relate the affair exactly to you as it happened.</P>
<P>We had been gone out about a quarter of an hour, intending to regale our&s;elves with &s;ome warm milk at a little farm-hou&s;e not far off. We &s;oon heard Edward, who ran after us, out of breath; we &s;topped to wait for him, concluding that he had obtained permi&s;&s;ion to be of our par|ty: he joined us; and after having walked a
<PB N="233" REF="045437_0565_10202AF7047098C0">
few paces together, we met a little boy wheeling a barrow, in which there was a ca&s;k of vinegar. He was civilly turning out of our way, but by &s;o doing, he overturned the wheelbarrow, and the ca&s;k of vinegar fell to the ground. The poor child was in &s;ad perplexity, becau&s;e he was not &s;trong enough to put it back into the barrow, and he &s;aw no grown per&s;on at hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. Charles, the good Charles, immediately ran up to him: Come William, come Edward, cried he, we mu&s;t help this good little boy; we may &s;urely find &s;trength between us four to re|place his ca&s;k. Oh yes, truly, &s;aid Edward, it would become us mightily to employ our&s;elves in &s;uch an office. And why not? &s;aid Charles: methinks it is never unbecoming to do a good action: but, however, you may &s;tand by if you plea&s;e; you &s;hall &s;ee that we three will do it. We immediately went to work, and in an in|&s;tant the barrow was &s;et upright, and the ca&s;k placed upon it, though Edward did nothing all the while, but &s;ing, and laugh at us. The little boy was overjoyed, and after thanking us, went his way. Why Charles, &s;aid Edward, this is wonderful; it gives me plea&s;ure to &s;ee that you would make an excellent vinegar-merchant. Well brother, &s;aid Charles, if I &s;hould be one, and &s;hould ever have the misfortune to let fall my ca&s;k, I &s;hall be very glad to find any one good-natured enough to a&s;&s;i&s;t me. Well, you may laugh, &s;aid Edward, but what do you think papa would &s;ay, if he knew what you had done? He would love his &s;on the better for it, &s;aid Emi|ly. Papa is good-natured, and had he been in
<PB N="234" REF="045437_0566_10202AF88DC55460">
Charles' place, he would have done the &s;ame. Fie, &s;aid Edward, I blu&s;h for you both; it is ve|ry pretty indeed for per&s;ons of our condition to meddle with the affairs of common people! Oh, &s;aid Charles, if they want us &s;ometimes, we have much more occa&s;ion for them. We have a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed this little boy, but who knows but his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance may be one day nece&s;&s;ary to us?</P>
<P>You will &s;ee pre&s;ently, mamma, that Charles was in the right.</P>
<P>We were &s;carcely got to the farm-hou&s;e, when Edward propo&s;ed to us to go into a little boat, which was there floating in a &s;mall pond. Emi|ly and Charles refu&s;ed, &s;aying, that their papa has expre&s;&s;ly forbidden them. P&s;haw, he'll know nothing of it, &s;aid Edward. But brother, an&s;wered Charles, we ought never to do any thing which our papa &s;hould not know. Very well, &s;aid Edward, then I will go and take a run in the meadow, for it is no diver&s;ion to me to be here. We thought that this was his de&s;ign: but would you believe it, mamma, in&s;tead of go|ing, as he had &s;aid, into the meadow, he made a turn round the hou&s;e, and then went into the boat: about half an hour after this, we heard one cry out for help: we ran along with the far|mer and his &s;on; but what was our con&s;terna|tion, when we &s;aw the boat overturned, and the unfortunate Edward hidden under the water. A little boy was dragging him by the &s;kirt of his coat, but had not &s;trength to get him out of the water: it was he who cried for help. The far|mer immediately plunged into the water, and got them both out; but Edward was without &s;en&s;e
<PB N="235" REF="045437_0567_101FFD12C0D2B568">
or motion. Emily cried mo&s;t pitifully. As for my part, I was &s;o &s;truck, that I could not &s;peak. Charles was the only one who pre&s;erved pre&s;ence of mind: he immediately gave orders to have his brother carried into the farmer's hou&s;e, in order to recover him from his &s;woon. He then begged his &s;i&s;ter to compo&s;e her&s;elf. I will go back to my papa, in order to prevent his being told abruptly of this unhappy accident. In the mean while take care of my brother.</P>
<P>Do not you admire the&s;e wi&s;e and tender pre|cautions, mamma?</P>
<P>But what were the agitations of his parents when they heard his recital! Mrs. Grandi&s;on fainted: Mr. Grandi&s;on, after having given her the nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, ran to his &s;on. They had ju&s;t carried him into the hou&s;e: every one thought him dead. In &s;pite of all his firmne&s;s, Mr. Grandi&s;on could not forbear &s;hedding tears. Oh! how well does a good father love his chil|dren? he forgets all their faults, when he &s;ees them in danger. After much pains, Edward was at length brought to him&s;elf: but he is &s;till in bed in a high fever. Thus has he been puni&s;hed for his di&s;obedience; he has been at the point of lo&s;ing his own life, and of being the death of his parents. This will &s;erve as a le&s;&s;on to me, to be always docile and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive. Adieu, my dear mamma, you &s;hall &s;oon hear from me again. How many things have I to &s;ay to my little &s;i&s;t|er, on the affecting &s;cene &s;he had with you, but I will re&s;erve them for our corre&s;pondence.</P>

<P>MRS. Grandi&s;on is much better: Edward is nearly recovered, and I hope that this adventure will render him more wi&s;e in future. I told you in my la&s;t letter, of a little boy who &s;aved Edward, by holding the &s;kirt of his coat, but I forgot to tell you, that it was the little vi|negar-carrier, whom we had ju&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ted in re|placing his ca&s;k on the barrow. Charles &s;aid ve|ry right, when he ob&s;erved, that we know not what occa&s;ion we may have for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others. It mu&s;t have been all over with Edward, if we had not chanced to a&s;&s;i&s;t this little boy; for had we left him in the road with his wheel|barrow overturned, he would not have been in the way to have &s;een the accident which hap|pened afterwards to Edward, nor to have thrown him&s;elf into the water to &s;upport him, whil&s;t he called out for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But I mu&s;t relate to you a conver&s;ation which we had on the &s;ubject, ye&s;terday, after dinner, whil&s;t we were with Mr. Grandi&s;on in the &s;ick-chamber of Edward.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Grandi&s;on.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad to hear you make this reflection, my dear: you now &s;ee, as Charles ob&s;erved to you, that we cannot fore&s;ee how &s;oon we may have occa&s;ion for the very per|&s;on who &s;eems to &s;tand mo&s;t in need of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right, papa, and I feel much regret in not having a&s;&s;i&s;ted this little boy, who was afterwards to do me &s;o great a piece of &s;ervice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Grandi&s;on.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am well &s;atisfied, my child, that you are convinced you were wrong: you have only now to bear in mind your deliverer, and it may one day be your turn to render him a benefit. Till that time arrives, you may in &s;ome &s;ort acquit your&s;elf towards him, by a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing all tho&s;e whom you &s;ee in di&s;tre&s;s. You may al&s;o draw this very u&s;eful le&s;&s;on from your misfortune, never to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e who are be|neath us in rank. What would a young gen|tleman have done for you, had he been in the
<PB N="238" REF="045437_0570_10202B031D0C7278">
place of our little vinegar-carrier? He would, no doubt, have contented him&s;elf with calling out for help, without giving you any him&s;elf; and for fear of wetting his foot in the pond, he would have &s;uffered you to peri&s;h before his eyes. Our little boy, on the contrary, more courageous and more compa&s;&s;ionate, boldly threw him&s;elf into the water after you, at the hazard of his own life. You had a few mo|ments before, refu&s;ed him a little &s;ervice, which would have co&s;t you but a &s;light effort; and notwith&s;tanding your unkindne&s;s to him, he was not afraid to ri&s;k his own life to &s;ave your's. You have never yet, and perhaps never may know another action which equals this. Ten|der parents, a brother, a &s;i&s;ter, a friend, all owe to this poor boy a beloved object which they were on the point of lo&s;ing: &s;ociety owes to him one of its children, who may one day be of u&s;e to it. Let us take care then not to de&s;pi&s;e our fellow creatures, in whatever rank fortune may have placed them, &s;ince little people may &s;ometimes be of greater u&s;e to us than great ones.</P>
<P>My eyes were filled with tears, my dear mam|ma, during this di&s;cour&s;e of Mr. Grandi&s;on: I felt all he &s;aid, at the bottom of my heart. Oh! yes, I have often had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that the lower cla&s;s of people are by much the mo&s;t helpful when any accident makes their a&s;&s;i&s;tance needful: and tho&s;e cannot be bad, who are thus di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uccour their brethren.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear mamma, we are to dine to|morrow with Mr. Grandi&s;on's &s;i&s;ter: it is &s;eve|ral
<PB N="239" REF="045437_0571_10202B04A708BCA0">
miles from hence. I am obliged to leave off. We mu&s;t go to bed early to-night, in order to be up betimes in the morning. Edward cannot go with us, for which he is &s;o &s;orry, that I really pi|ty him: here again is another puni&s;hment for his fault. I will give you an account of our vi|&s;it. Write to me, pray, my dear mamma; at lea&s;t till my little &s;i&s;ter is able to be your &s;ecre|tary.</P>

<P>WE have had a great deal of plea&s;ure, my dear mamma, at lord and lady Cam|pley's. I wi&s;h you could have &s;een how well my friend Charles behaved in the mid&s;t of a nu|merous company. Another young boy, about his age, was there al&s;o: what a difference be|tween Charles and him! the latter &s;tiff and af|fected, perpetually bowing and admiring his clothes, at the &s;ame time &s;o aukwardly ba&s;hful, that he could not look any one in the face. Charles, on the contrary, has a noble and mo|de&s;t
<PB N="240" REF="045437_0572_10202B079C04ED88">
a&s;&s;urance, together with the greate&s;t ea&s;e and civility. He li&s;tens to others with attenti|on, and &s;peaks but little; but what he &s;ays is full of grace and ju&s;tne&s;s, and every one hears him with plea&s;ure. He di&s;tingui&s;hes, to a nicety, what is due to every one in company. Re&s;pect|ful towards his &s;uperiors either in rank or age, polite to his equals, and affable to his inferiors. He pays the mo&s;t delicate attention to all, with|out appearing ceremonious. I will give you an in&s;tance of this. We went to take a walk in the garden, a young lady of the company had for|gotten her hat; &s;he &s;oon found the &s;un very trouble&s;ome. Charles quickly ob&s;erved this, and before &s;he could return back to the hou&s;e for her hat, &s;he perceived Charles bringing it to her: he a&s;ked her leave to put it on her head him&s;elf, which he did with all imaginable politene&s;s: yes, I a&s;&s;ure you, he is like a grown man, in compa|ny. After dinner he played a very difficult piece on the harp&s;ichord, and received the applau&s;es of all. Oh! if I were but as amiable as he is, how happy &s;hould I be! were it only that I &s;hould give you more plea&s;ure, mamma. The two daughters of lady Campley are very well brought up. The elde&s;t, who&s;e name is Charlotte, &s;ings admirably: Emily loves her tenderly; they have engaged to write to each other.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not forget to tell you of what hap|pened to us on our return. Mr. and Mrs. Grandi&s;on, with Emily and a lady who accom|panied them, went in the fir&s;t carriage: Mr. Bartlet, Charles, and I, in the &s;econd: we had &s;carcely gone two miles, before we &s;aw a poor old
<PB N="241" REF="045437_0573_10202B0BEE948B98">
man at the foot of a tree. Charles made the coachman &s;top, and turning to Mr. Bartlet, &s;aid, look, I pray you, Sir, at this old man: he ap|pears to be blind, and there is no one near him: What will become of the poor wretch? Will you permit me to go and a&s;k him a few que&s;ti|ons? With all my heart, my dear, an&s;wered the worthy Mr. Bartlet. Charles immediately a|lighted from the carriage, and ran to the poor man. Who are you, friend, &s;aid he; and how came you to be alone in this &s;olitary place?&mdash;Alas! an&s;wered the blind man, I live above two miles from hence: I went out this morning to a&s;k charity in a village &s;omewhere hereabouts, I don't know on which &s;ide: and my guide, a ve|ry naughty boy, refu&s;ed to lead me home again, becau&s;e I had not gathered money enough in the day to pay him as I u&s;ed. I have no other hope but in Heaven, who perhaps, will &s;end &s;ome one to my relief. But, &s;aid Charles, it is ju&s;t &s;un|&s;et, and it will &s;oon be night, and what will be|come of you here? I mu&s;t peri&s;h then in mi&s;e|ry, an&s;wered the blind man: No, replied Charles, I will be that per&s;on whom heaven has &s;ent to your relief. Oh! Mr. Bartlet, &s;aid he, coming back to us, do not deny me the delight of &s;aving a mi&s;erable poor old blind man, who is on the point of peri&s;hing if we do not take pity on him. Night approaches; What will become of this poor creature if nobody a&s;&s;i&s;ts him? He lives but two miles off, what hinders our taking him in our carriage? Yes, Charles, &s;aid Mr. Bartlet, follow the dictates of your ge|nerous
<PB N="242" REF="045437_0574_10202B0D79915DA0">
heart. Charles had no &s;ooner received this an&s;wer, than he took the old man by the hand, and put him into the coach. Any other be&s;ides my friend might perhaps have felt &s;ome fal&s;e &s;hame in riding by the &s;ide of a poor man in tattered clothes, but he, on the contrary, &s;eem|ed to think him&s;elf honoured by it. We had no occa&s;ion to go far out of our road to put this poor man into his cottage. I &s;aw Charles &s;lip &s;ome money into his hand as he went out of the car|riage, and we parted after receiving from him a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings. On our return home, every body be&s;towed prai&s;es on this act of humanity. But, &s;aid Emily, this man, with his long beard and his rags, mu&s;t have an odd figure in a cha|riot. Ah! &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid Charles, I had &s;o much plea&s;ure in giving relief to a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed creature, that I did not think about his accoutrement. Mr. Grandi&s;on could not refrain his tears: he held out his arms to his &s;on, who threw him&s;elf into them; whil&s;t he tenderly pre&s;&s;ed him to his heart. Oh! mamma, my eyes were filled dur|ing this affecting &s;cene. This chariot, will ever appear to me like a triumphal car to my friend.</P>

<P>I THANK you, my dear mamma, for your kind letter: it is a long time &s;ince you have written to me; I feared that you were di&s;plea&s;ed with me. Do you know what I do? I always carry the la&s;t letter that I receive from you in my bo&s;om, that I may have it at hand to read over again the good le&s;&s;ons which you always give me, and I &s;eem to my&s;elf the better every time I read it.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday was Mrs. Grandi&s;on's birth-day; Charles ro&s;e very early; he was much longer at his devotions that day than u&s;ual; he was pray|ing, no doubt, for his dear mamma, as I do for you on your birth-day. He appeared to us dre&s;&s;ed in a new &s;uit; you would have been charmed with his fine air: but before I pro|ceed, I mu&s;t go back a little in my narrative.</P>
<P>It is near a month &s;ince Edward and Charles had each of them a new &s;ummer-&s;uit, which they had cho&s;en them&s;elves. Edward put on his the fir&s;t day, but Charles continued to wear
<PB N="244" REF="045437_0576_10202B14E2DD8D68">
his old one, which was &s;till however very neat. His father a&s;ked him the rea&s;on of this; he an|&s;wered, that he re&s;erved his be&s;t dre&s;s for a vi&s;it of ceremony. Do not you perceive, mamma, that this vi&s;it of ceremony is that which he is to pay his mother this morning. How amiable is Charles! and what a fine turn of thought there is in every thing he does. Emily had already knocked at our door, and was waiting for us impatiently. We went down together, and found Mr. and Mrs. Grandi&s;on at breakfa&s;t in the &s;aloon. Charles was the fir&s;t who congratu|lated his mother on her birth-day: he knelt be|fore her, and re&s;pectfully ki&s;&s;ed her hand. Oh! if I could but recollect all that he &s;aid! but I was too much moved to remember the words. Emily followed, and wi&s;hed her mother joy in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and graceful terms. Mrs. Grandi&s;on pre&s;&s;ed her two children to her bo|&s;om, ki&s;&s;ing them with tenderne&s;s. Their father then embraced them, whil&s;t I made my compli|ments in the be&s;t manner I could: they were at lea&s;t &s;incere, for I truly love my worthy benefac|tors. Edward came in ju&s;t after: I know he loves his mamma: Who, indeed, does not love her? but yet his manners do not plea&s;e me like tho&s;e of Charles. The one does every thing in a more agreeable way than the other. Mrs. Grandi&s;on made every one of us a pre&s;ent. Emi|ly received a pretty pair of bracelets, Charles and Edward had each a watch. Would you be|lieve it, &s;ince ye&s;terday only, Edward's is already out of order! as for me, my dear mamma, I have a fine micro&s;cope: this is of more value to
<PB N="245" REF="045437_0577_10202B17D1972898">
me than all the toys in the world. Oh! the good Mr. Grandi&s;on! how have I merited this gift?</P>
<P>In the evening we had a large company from all the neighbouring hou&s;es: Charles did the honours of the table like a grown man. He carved the meat, he filled the gla&s;&s;es, he &s;erved the ladies; in a word, he acquitted him&s;elf of this employment to admiration. Here is a very long letter, mamma, but I am talking of my friend, and to you: no wonder then, that I know not when to conclude; and I cannot do it now, without &s;ending a tender embrace to my &s;i&s;ter, which &s;he &s;hall give back to you.</P>

<P>EVERY day here brings new plea&s;ures with it, my dear mamma. Your &s;on is now become a gardener. Will you lend me your a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, &s;aid my friend to me the other day? I want to turn up afre&s;h the ground in my garden: the flower-&s;ea&s;on is pa&s;&s;ed, and I have a mind to
<PB N="246" REF="045437_0578_10202B1AC506DD80">
&s;ow &s;ome &s;allad to regale my mamma during the remainder of the &s;ummer. Will I? &s;aid I, yes, certainly; you always oblige me when you give me an opportunity of doing any thing for you. We dre&s;&s;ed our&s;elves in light wai&s;tcoats, and each being equipped with a &s;pade, we cleared the garden that very evening. We gathered up with care all the roots, in order to put them un|der ground before we went away. Ye&s;terday we ro&s;e at five in the morning: we do not al|low our&s;elves to &s;leep late, becau&s;e we cannot tran&s;plant any thing during the heat of the day. This morning we returned early to our work, and had the plea&s;ure to fini&s;h it before breakfa&s;t. We only wait now to &s;ee our roots and our &s;eeds &s;pring up, and we &s;hall employ this inter|val in extirpating the weeds. What plea&s;ure we &s;hall have in &s;eeing our plants grow up! Hi|therto I have, like other children, &s;een the pro|ductions of nature without paying any attention to them: But Charles has taught me to make re|flections on all that I &s;ee. I will give you an example of this, in a conver&s;ation which we held ye&s;terday. I do not know whether I ever told you that Charles had a pretty aviary filled with all &s;orts of birds, which he takes care of him|&s;elf. We had ju&s;t fini&s;hed our gardening, and were taking a walk with Emily; &s;top a mo|ment, &s;aid Charles, I mu&s;t leave you, I have not yet looked after my birds to-day.</P>

<P>MR. and Mrs. Grandi&s;on are gone to &s;pend a few days at a friend's hou&s;e; and Mr. Bartlet is ju&s;t &s;et off for London: we remain, therefore, my dear mamma, by our&s;elves, with only an old waiting woman, and a &s;mall number

of the dome&s;tics. Emily manages every thing in the ab&s;ence of her mother: yes, indeed, &s;he gives orders to all, and with as much di&s;cretion as if &s;he were twenty years of age. Is not this very pretty in &s;o young a lady? She is not yet twelve years old, and the &s;ervants re&s;pect her al|ready as if &s;he were their mi&s;tre&s;s. Do you know why? it is, becau&s;e &s;he always treats them with kindne&s;s, without de&s;cending to familiarity. She follows in this the example of her brother Charles. You cannot imagine how much he is beloved and honoured by all the people in the hou&s;e. Edward, on the contrary, is always at play with them, and yet they cannot bear him. It is true, he is continually playing them malici|ous tricks, and frequently treats them with in|&s;upportable haughtine&s;s. Oh, that he had but gone with his papa and mamma: now that they are no longer at hand to check him, there is no keeping him in order. Charles, Emily, and I, follow our agreeable &s;tudies in the &s;ame man|ner as if Mr. and Mrs. Grandi&s;on were here: but Edward takes advantage of their ab&s;ence to &s;pend the day in trifling, and running about the fields. Nay, he even tries to divert us from our &s;tudies, as if he thought our application a re|proach to idlene&s;s. We were all ye&s;terday morn|ing in one corner of the room bu&s;y at our draw|ing. Edward amu&s;ed him&s;elf with a fly at the end of a thread; and under pretence of follow|ing it, came up to us, and jogged our chairs, in order to hinder our bu&s;ine&s;s. Emily, carried away by her vivacity, was going to rebuke him &s;martly, but Charles prevented her; and addre&s;s|ing

They were hardly got to the end of one of the walks, before a heavy &s;hower fell, which o|bliged them to come in again, to the great regret of Edward. Charles, in order to con&s;ole him, propo&s;ed that we &s;hould amu&s;e our&s;elves in read|ing a little ancient hi&s;tory. I want none of your books, replied Edward, &s;urlily: I am to be an officer: I have no occa&s;ion to be a learned man.</P>

</SP>
<P>Edward made a face at his &s;i&s;ter, and wanted to oblige us to play at pu&s;s-in-the-corner, and to take John to make a fifth. But Charles, who, with all his &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, is capable of the greate&s;t firmne&s;s, an&s;wered him, No, bro|ther, it was not my fault ju&s;t now, that I did not gratify your humour, but the rain prevented it. I then propo&s;ed to you another amu&s;ement, which you might have been &s;atisfied with, but you did not approve it, though my &s;i&s;ter and my friend are very well plea&s;ed; I think, therefore, I may give way to a rea&s;onable ta&s;te rather than to your caprices.</P>
<P>Edward, who knows very well that his bro|ther is not ea&s;ily turned from his re&s;olution, left the room grumbling; and, in &s;pite of the rain, ran into the court to play with a great ma&s;tiff, whom he is grown very fond of, for the &s;ake of teazing him. He did not return in le&s;s than an hour, almo&s;t wet to the &s;kin, and covered from head to foot with dirt. As for our part, during

this interval, after having read the life of Epa|minondas, which had given us infinite plea&s;ure, we had time al&s;o to take up our drawings and fini&s;h them. An opportunity happened after dinner, to &s;end them to Mr. Grandi&s;on, and this morning we have had the plea&s;ure of hearing that he was very well plea&s;ed. But what mu&s;t he think of Edward, who has &s;ent him nothing? I am quite afflicted at this. I would give any thing in the world that he were as good, as amiable, as diligent as his brother; then nothing would be wanting to complete the happine&s;s of his parents. I &s;ee with regret how much pain he cau&s;es them. Oh, my dear mamma, may I never &s;ee the day in which I &s;hall give you pain! No, no, be a&s;|&s;ured I never can, whil&s;t I think of your tender|ne&s;s to me. I am too &s;en&s;ible of what I ought to be, to render my&s;elf worthy of it.

<P>ONE of the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e is ill. You will &s;ee whether it be po&s;&s;ible to have a more feeling and compa&s;&s;ionate heart than the good Emily.

One would think to &s;ee her, that it was a beloved &s;i&s;ter whom &s;he at|tended. How amiable it is in a young lady, to have &s;o much humanity! Edward, as u&s;ual, had &s;ome fault to find.

If it be their duty to &s;erve us whil&s;t they are in health, it is equally our's, to take care of them in &s;ickne&s;s: be&s;ides, poor Peggy has frequently watched over me du|ring the ailments of my infancy. What I now do for her is at lea&s;t no more than &s;he has done for me: and I think of the plea&s;ure that I

Ah! &s;aid I to my&s;elf, Emily does not know what I have &s;een my dear mamma do. When our poor Nanny had a fever, it was mamma that took the whole care of her: but this recollection brought a &s;orrowful thought with it. There is &s;uch a number of &s;ervants in this hou&s;e! and you, my dear mamma, have but one to do every thing for you. How unfortunate is this! You mu&s;t needs be forced to do a number of things very ill-&s;uited to the widow of a colonel. And then, if my &s;i&s;ter were but big enough to a&s;&s;i&s;t you! But no, &s;he only encrea&s;es your trouble: and I, what do I do here; in&s;tead of being with you to comfort and &s;upport you with all my power? This reflection cuts me to the heart. There is only one thing which &s;oftens it; it is the hope, that by attending to my education, I may, one day, be in a &s;ituation to put an end to your troubles.

<P>HOW I love your young Emily! Yes, my dear &s;on, there is no virtue more amiable than humanity. It were much to be wi&s;hed, that every young lady would follow this fine ex|ample; and in&s;tead of tormenting the &s;ervants, would learn to treat them with goodne&s;s. How is it po&s;&s;ible to be in&s;en&s;ible to the plea&s;ure of being beloved by tho&s;e who &s;urround us?</P>
<P>But why are you afflicted, my dear &s;on, at my having but one &s;ervant? it is no happine&s;s to have a multitude of dome&s;tics; there is more of &s;hew than real u&s;e in it. Every &s;ervant in a hou&s;e announces &s;ome additional want in the ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s of it, and &s;ubjects them to ad|ditional cares. Had I the means, I &s;hould, no doubt, have about me tho&s;e attendants which my &s;ituation in life would require. I &s;hould look upon this as a duty, as it would be the means of giving &s;upport to many poor people, who might otherwi&s;e want employment. But &s;ince Heaven has not thought fit to afford me riches, I do not think that I am to be pitied for having

<P>And now, my dear child, tell me what are tho&s;e occupations which you &s;ay do not become the widow of a colonel! You certainly did not reflect on what you were &s;aying. There is no di&s;grace in &s;erving our&s;elves, when we are not in a condition to pay for the &s;ervices of others. Will it not be better, after my death, that you &s;hould have it to &s;ay; my mother her&s;elf prepar|ed our &s;imple repa&s;ts; our clothes were the work of her hands; &s;carcely could &s;he procure for us what was nece&s;&s;ary, but neverthele&s;s, &s;he owed no one any thing; than to have this reproach thrown on you; your parents, it is true, lived according to their rank and birth; they had a &s;uperb hou&s;e, magnificent furniture, a train of dome&s;tics, but all this is left unpaid for. What, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, would be the &s;on of a co|lonel? a de&s;pi&s;ed young man, who notwith&s;tand|ing his own innocence, would be &s;tigmatized for the faults of his parents, whil&s;t a man of honour, of the mo&s;t common birth, would &s;carce ac|knowledge him as his equal.

<P>WE have been in the greate&s;t con&s;ternation this night, my dear mamma. The hou&s;e of our neighbour, Mr. Fal&s;ton, is entirely burnt down. What dreadful flames! The &s;ky was as red as blood. My heart beat: I wept. It is &s;uch a melancholy thing for the father of a family, to lo&s;e all his &s;ub&s;tance! What &s;trict precautions ought we to take again&s;t fire, &s;ince one moment may produce &s;o terrible a mis|fortune! It was the Mi&s;s Fal&s;tons who were the cau&s;e of this. Ye&s;terday evening, unknown to any one, they got &s;ome lighted coals out of the kitchen, and carried them up into a little &s;pare-room, in order to toa&s;t a crumpet, which they had procured in &s;ecret. A little while after, they heard their papa call them: ha&s;tily eating up their half toa&s;ted-crumpet, they ran down to him. Their bed hour &s;oon came, and they went up into their apartment, without thinking any more of the lighted coals, which they had left in the little room. The fire, doubtle&s;s, fir&s;t
<PB N="262" REF="045437_0594_10202B6DB0EB25C8">
took hold of the wain&s;cot, and from thence the floor and the furniture. In &s;hort, about two o'clock in the morning, whil&s;t all the family were a&s;leep, the whole hou&s;e was in flames. See, mam|ma, how heaven has puni&s;hed them! For the &s;ake of eating a paltry crumpet, they have reduced their father's hou&s;e to cinders! Now they lament; they a&s;k pardon: they are almo&s;t dead with grief: but does all this avail? The fire has con|&s;umed their whole property: they could neither &s;ave furniture, papers, or money. Scarcely could the young ladies e&s;cape with only a &s;light cover|ing over them: and Mr. Fal&s;ton him&s;elf, was near lo&s;ing his life. He is terribly burnt in many parts of his body; and mu&s;t have peri&s;h|ed in the mid&s;t of the flames, had it not been for the courage of one of his &s;ervants. What will now become of the pride of the&s;e young ladies? Ye&s;terday &s;o rich, to-day &s;o poor! They treated the pea&s;ants with contempt, becau&s;e they had not fine hou&s;es. To-day they feel it as a favour, that the&s;e very pea&s;ants will, out of pity, receive them into their cottages. In how &s;hort a time may pride be humbled! Oh &s;urely, it is a &s;ad thing not to treat our inferiors with affabi|lity, when we are liable our&s;elves to &s;tand in need of the compa&s;&s;ion of the lowe&s;t of them!</P>

<P>I Take the liberty, my dear papa, to make an humble petition to you, in behalf of an un|fortunate family. Can this emotion of my heart di&s;plea&s;e you? No, I do not fear it: your own is too full of goodne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>You have been informed, by Emily's letter to mamma, of the cruel misfortune which has be|fallen Mr. Fal&s;ton; but not the whole of it.
<PB N="264" REF="045437_0596_10202B7229D22188">
Emily could only tell you of the hou&s;e and effects; but he is al&s;o on the point of lo&s;ing his la&s;t &s;hilling. He has creditors, who forbore to pre&s;s him, whil&s;t he was rich; but now that his &s;ecurity &s;eems doubtful, they in&s;i&s;t upon pay|ment, without delay, and have already threatened him with a &s;eizure of, all his property. On a vi&s;it, which I paid him, I heard him &s;ay to Nel|&s;on the attorney, that all his debts did not amount to more than two hundred pounds. This is but a &s;mall &s;um. Mu&s;t he, for want of this, after having &s;uffered &s;o terrible a mis|fortune, be deprived of the only means left him of breeding up his family, and be him&s;elf a prey to want, in his old age? Heaven forbid that we &s;hould &s;uffer it! Now, papa, I'll tell you what I have thought: the legacy which my uncle left me, is, you know, five thou&s;and pounds. I think this a great &s;um. It is in your hands, and you may di&s;po&s;e of it. I &s;urely may give up two hundred pounds to extricate an hone&s;t man from &s;uch an embarra&s;&s;ment. I &s;hall be rich enough after, as you have the goodne&s;s to add, every year, the intere&s;t to the principal of this legacy. I entreat, papa, that you will not re|fu&s;e my reque&s;t. It gives me a thou&s;and times more plea&s;ure than the two hundred pounds ever can. Oh! if I &s;hould but pre&s;erve from in|digence an unhappy man, and his two children, what a happine&s;s this will be for me! Permit me to re&s;emble you on this occa&s;ion, you who are &s;o beneficent. Do not you in&s;truct me to be &s;o? If you were here, I would throw my&s;elf at your feet: I would ardently &s;upplicate&mdash;
<PB N="265" REF="045437_0597_10202B76837CCE98">
But there is no occa&s;ion; your wi&s;dom mu&s;t de|cide on my reque&s;t. My duty is a blind &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to your will; a profound re&s;pect for your virtues, and the mo&s;t tender love for your per&s;on.</P>
<P>Vouch&s;afe, I be&s;eech you, to pre&s;ent to my mamma my mo&s;t lively &s;entiments of re&s;pect and tenderne&s;s.</P>

<P>I Ha&s;ten, my dear father, to an&s;wer the kind letter that you have honoured me with. You would have wept with tenderne&s;s, as I did, could you have been witne&s;s to the te&s;timonies of gratitude which Mr. Fal&s;ton has lavi&s;hed up|on me. Whil&s;t he embraced me, I &s;aw the big tears fall down his cheeks.

would have been too humiliating in his circum|&s;tances, to receive an a&s;&s;i&s;tance which might have had the air of a charity. I pre&s;ented him therefore with the Bank-bill, not as a pre&s;ent, but as lent to him, and which he might pay a|gain at his own convenience. He would give me an acknowledgment, which I received, but im|mediately tore it before him, telling him, that his word was enough, to let him &s;ee that he would not be liable to any further trouble on this &s;ub|ject.

<HEAD>LETTER I. WILLIAM DANVERS TO HIS MOTHER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>AUGUST 12.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>OH! my dear mamma, poor Charles has met with a &s;ad accident! his leg is &s;calded &s;o badly, that he is not able to walk: it is all owing to Edward's aukwardne&s;s; he threw a tea-kettle of boiling water over him. Never, no never, was &s;een &s;uch patience and goodne&s;s as my friend di&s;played on this occa&s;ion. Any one el&s;e would have been in a pa&s;&s;ion with his brother, and have loaded him with reproaches; but Charles, on the contrary, only &s;ought to conceal the pain which he felt. Do not afflict your&s;elf, Edward, I be|&s;eech you, &s;aid he, it is not very bad: but we &s;oon perceived that he &s;uffered more than he was willing to confe&s;s, for his leg became &s;o much &s;welled, that we were obliged to cut off his &s;tocking with a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars. Emily bur&s;t into tears:
<PB N="270" REF="045437_0602_10202B83D55D5470">
&s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, to Edward, what you have done by your heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s; you have, perhaps, lamed your brother for the re&s;t of his life. I wi&s;h this misfortune had befallen you, in&s;tead of him. It had better have happened to no one, &s;aid Charles, interrupting his &s;i&s;ter. But come, my dear Emi|ly, this is not worth &s;o much concern. I &s;hall &s;oon be cured: Edward did not do it by de&s;ign; it is a misfortune; but had it been &s;till greater, we mu&s;t have con&s;oled our&s;elves. No, replied Emily, I cannot forgive his want of care: look at him too; he &s;tands there like a po&s;t, in&s;tead of flying to &s;end for a &s;urgeon. There is no occa&s;ion for one, &s;aid Charles; give me only a cloth and &s;ome cold water to bathe my leg, and in a few days it will be well. But, &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Emily and me, Mr. Bartlet will &s;oon be here; I beg you will not tell him that Edward had any hand in this accident; and you, my dear brother, give me your hand; your affliction is more painful to me than this little burn, of which I now &s;carcely feel the &s;mart.</P>
<P>What a happine&s;s it is to be thus ma&s;ter of one's &s;elf! We may well admire Charles, when he can behave in this manner: at the &s;ame time, I feel, how u&s;ele&s;s it is to fret and be impatient, and that being tran&s;ported with anger will not remove the evil.</P>
<P>But the plea&s;ure which I have in writing to you, makes me forget that Charles has intreated me to keep him company. Adieu, my dear mam|ma; permit me to leave you to return to my friend. I &s;alute my little &s;i&s;ter, and conjure her

<P>ALAS, poor Charles! It is now two days &s;ince his leg has been extended on a cu&s;hi|on: I believe he &s;uffers much, but he per&s;i&s;ts in keeping it to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Emily a&s;ked him ye&s;terday, if he did not find him&s;elf very &s;ad, under his confinement. Why &s;hould I make my&s;elf &s;o, an&s;wered he, it would only aggravate the pain that I &s;uffer; I had much rather amu&s;e my&s;elf with the hopes of being &s;oon cured: be&s;ides, would it not be a &s;hame if I could not comfort my&s;elf under &s;o &s;mall a mis|fortune as this? I have rea&s;on to expect many greater in the cour&s;e of my life, and the&s;e &s;light accidents will teach me, in time, to exerci&s;e my courage and re&s;olution again&s;t the approach of greater. But it is very hard though, &s;aid Emily,
<PB N="272" REF="045437_0604_10202B8B25D14640">
to be forced to &s;uffer &s;o much for the fault of another. It is true, an&s;wered Charles, I had ra|ther it had been by my own, for then my brother would not have had &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s about it.</P>

<P>It is your goodne&s;s, my dear brother, which makes you pay attention to them: but you have narrowly e&s;caped lo&s;ing your leg by this accident.</P>

</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is needle&s;s to &s;ay that I &s;hould have been much afflicted at &s;uch a misfortune, but as it could not have happened to me unle&s;s by the will of heaven, I &s;hould have endeavoured to &s;ubmit my own to that, in order to have ob|tained &s;trength, to &s;upport me under the affliction.</P>
<P>What do you &s;ay, mamma? to think like Charles, is not this the only way to combat mis|fortune? I yet remember the fatal day on which I lo&s;t my father. You wept; I was incon&s;olable; but our tears and lamentations could not bring him back to life. You took me by the hand, and &s;aid, Come, my &s;on, let us pray to the Al|mighty, and he will comfort us; I &s;oon &s;aw that
<PB N="273" REF="045437_0605_10202B8CB9335B38">
you became more tranquil; and I found al&s;o my own heart relieved by prayer. I found this a &s;ure means of alleviating di&s;tre&s;s; I will &s;ubmit therefore to the decrees of Providence, whatever evils may befal me; and hope that I &s;hall bear them with con&s;tancy, when I reflect that it is the will of God which inflicts them; of that God to whom I &s;ay daily, "<HI>thy will be done.</HI>"</P>
<P>But why do I remind you of the&s;e &s;ad events, my dear mamma; you, in whom I would wi&s;h to excite no &s;entiments, but tho&s;e of joy?&mdash;If I have afflicted you, I know but of one remedy; it is to take my little &s;i&s;ter in your arms, to ca|re&s;s her, and tell her of your tenderne&s;s and of mine for her; I am &s;ure that her &s;weet &s;miles will give you back to peace and happine&s;s.</P>

But I mu&s;t return to my friend Charles. Mr. Bartlet a&s;ked us this morning after breakfa&s;t if we would take a turn in the park; tho' Charles finds him&s;elf much recovered at pre&s;ent, he begged to be excu&s;ed being of the party. My burn is not entirely cured, &s;aid he; and I wi&s;h that my papa and mamma, at their return, &s;hould not perceive that any thing ails me. If I &s;hould walk now, perhaps my leg may &s;uffer from the fatigue, and my parents will not fail to ob&s;erve it. This will afflict them, and I would rather deprive my&s;elf of the plea&s;ure of a walk than cau&s;e them the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s. You are in the right, &s;aid Mr. Bartlet, and I ap|prove this fore&s;ight; it does honour to your heart. Charles remained in his chamber, and Edward, Emily and I walked till noon.</P>
<P>At our return we found Charles waiting for us in the parlour below: we were a little &s;urpri|zed at this, as he had told us that he did not in|tend quitting his chamber. He had &s;uffered &s;ome pain by coming down &s;tairs, but the plea|&s;ure of meeting his papa and mamma &s;omething the &s;ooner by it, was, &s;aid he, well worth that. He had ordered the dinner earlier, that we might be more at liberty to receive them. With what alacrity did he fly down the &s;teps, when he heard their carriage enter the court-yard! With what joy did he throw him&s;elf into the arms of his father and mother! Scarcely could he force him|&s;elf
<PB N="275" REF="045437_0607_10202B9402E02908">
from them, to give place to us. You would have been a&s;toni&s;hed, had you &s;een with what grace he gave his hand to his mother, to conduct her into the parlour: it put me in mind, my dear mother, of the joy that I &s;hall feel when I return to you: it will be as lively as that of my friend Charles, I promi&s;e you. But I mu&s;t recount to you a conver&s;ation which has ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed between him and his brother: you will judge whether it be to his honour, or not, without my anticipating.</P>

<P>Charles had &s;carcely &s;aid this, when Mr. and Mrs. Grandi&s;on came down. He related the adventure of the china-plate with &s;o much wit and addre&s;s, and gave &s;uch a turn to the whole affair, that they found more to laugh at than to

<P>I HAVE nothing new to tell you of to-day, my dear mamma, but I expect, that to-mor|row will afford many intere&s;ting things to enter|tain you with: it is the birth-day of Charles. Edward tells me, that we are to be entertained like kings, becau&s;e it is his brother's cu&s;tom to give a treat to all the young people of the neigh|bourhood on that day. Emily, on the contra|ry, &s;ays, that he will invite no one this year; and that he has already formed the re&s;olution of em|ploying the money which his father will give him, in buying books of in&s;truction and enter|tainment. I, for my part, wi&s;h he may do this la&s;t: for the company will leave us when the

<P>I think I do not betray his confidence, when I tell you that he has privately trained up a pret|ty &s;tarling, which he intends as a pre&s;ent to his &s;i&s;ter, until &s;he receives one which her aunt is to &s;end her. He has accu&s;tomed it already to eat out of his hand, and to fly out of its cage. Emi|ly does not expect this pre&s;ent, and &s;he will be &s;urprized when &s;he receives it. The bird be|gins already to repeat her name very prettily. I will al&s;o train up one which &s;hall continually repeat to me your's and my &s;i&s;ter's: not that I have occa&s;ion for this to make me think of you, for happy as I am here, this is the chief plea&s;ure that I enjoy whil&s;t &s;o far removed from tho&s;e whom I love the be&s;t in the world.</P>

<P>We ro&s;e this morning very early: our cu&s;tom is, to read every day one or two chapters from the Old Te&s;tament, before we come down to breakfa&s;t. Mr. Grandi&s;on came into the room in the mid&s;t of our lecture: Charles immedi|ately ro&s;e to &s;alute his father.</P>

The generality of readers pronounce their words either with a &s;nuffle or a whine, without attend|ing to the &s;en&s;e of what they read, which is ex|tremely tire&s;ome to their hearers. One ought particularly to read hi&s;tory in a natural and un|affected tone, as if the recital were made by

<P>I BEGIN this letter, my dear mamma, where I left off ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>Before we went down to breakfa&s;t, Charles opened the paper which his father had given him. He found four guineas in it: he had ne|ver before &s;een &s;o much money at once. After con&s;idering over it a little, he turned to me: William, &s;aid he, I &s;hould like to know your opinion: there are few young people in our neighbourhood, who&s;e &s;ociety will give us much plea&s;ure; they are for the mo&s;t part &s;o fond of noi&s;e and racket, that their company is in&s;upport|able. Young Friendly, is the only one who&s;e character is at all &s;uited to mine; and he has been gone the&s;e three days to London with his mo|ther. What do you advi&s;e me to do with this money? Were I in your place, &s;aid I, I would keep it, in order to purcha&s;e &s;omething u&s;eful: three or four hours of playing and dancing will &s;oon pa&s;s away, but &s;ome books or prints will be a daily amu&s;ement to us. But will not you

be di&s;appointed, &s;aid he, if we &s;pend this even|ing in our ordinary way without company? No, &s;urely, an&s;wered I, I am happy enough in your &s;ociety. If that be the ca&s;e, &s;aid he, taking me by the hand, I may follow my fir&s;t idea. By this time we were at the entrance of the par|lour. Mrs. Grandi&s;on embraced her &s;on with tenderne&s;s, and gave him her ble&s;&s;ing. After breakfa&s;t we remained alone with Mr. Grandi|&s;on. Charles took his father by the hand, and &s;aid to him, may I a&s;k you one que&s;tion, papa?</P>

How much will the&s;e poor people be rejoiced at the little fea&s;t which I &s;hall prepare for them!

<P>YESTERDAY, my dear mamma, Charles gave his entertainment to the poor people of the pari&s;h. They were fea&s;ted with plenty of roa&s;t beef, plumb-pudding, and the vegetables of the &s;ea&s;on. I never had more plea&s;ure than in &s;eeing the&s;e good people regale them&s;elves. Joy and gratitude were painted on their coun|tenances. They drank our healths in &s;ome ex|cellent beer, repeating at every draught, Long life and happine&s;s to Charles Grandi&s;on! The eyes of Charles were frequently filled with tears. During dinner-time, he took notice of a poor man, almo&s;t blind with age, who, he fancied, was not &s;ufficiently attended to by the re&s;t: he called
<PB N="288" REF="045437_0620_10202BB83B4C8AC0">
to a young one, who &s;at next him, &s;aying, take care of that good man; he is one of my princi|pal gue&s;ts; I want to &s;ee him eat with a good appetite. Father, &s;aid he, you de&s;erve the fir&s;t place in my fe&s;tival. The young ones ought to honour your old age, that they them&s;elves may be honoured in their turn, when they be|come old.</P>
<P>When the repa&s;t was ended, Charles divided the remainder of his money among his gue&s;ts. Yes, mamma, he gave them all that he had re|ceived from his father. You will readily ima|gine what ble&s;&s;ings they be&s;towed upon him. He was &s;o moved with tenderne&s;s, that he could not contain him&s;elf. He took me by the hand, and we went off together, without being able ei|ther of us to &s;peak a word. It was not till we had entered the hou&s;e, that he &s;aid to me, Well, my dear friend, can there be a greater plea&s;ure than in comforting the unfortunate? Oh, no, an&s;wered I, throwing my arms round his neck, you could not have given me a more delightful entertainment. I felt my&s;elf as much affected as my friend. Alas! thought I, how much are the poor to be pitied! They often want the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;aries of life, whil&s;t we are &s;eated every day at tables, covered with delicacies, where our only trouble is how to chu&s;e the mo&s;t delicious. I &s;hall, from this day, be the more grateful to Hea|ven, from whom we receive the&s;e favours, as well as more compa&s;&s;ionate to tho&s;e who &s;uffer for the want of them. Yes, my greate&s;t plea|&s;ure &s;hall be, to give them comfort, by following the example of my friend Charles.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="045437_0621_10202BBCA0EA1DF0">
After dinner, we went to take a walk. We expected to pa&s;s the evening among our&s;elves, in our ordinary amu&s;ements; but what was our &s;urprize, when, on returning to the hou&s;e, we found there a large company! Mr. Grandi&s;on had invited all the gentlemen of the neighbour|hood, with their children, to celebrate the birth|day of his &s;on. We had a pretty concert; and after it, a ball. Charles and his &s;i&s;ter did won|ders. How much I wi&s;hed that I could &s;ing and play as they did; but you know, mamma, it is not my fault that I cannot. You were not able to give me the advantage of ma&s;ters. At pre&s;ent, I partake of that benefit, with my friends, and I hope to profit &s;o much by it, as to be able one day to equal them.</P>
<P>I am obliged to break off here, my dear mam|ma, being ju&s;t called upon to partake of a little tour into the country. I expect a great deal of plea&s;ure from this tour, which I will not fail to give you an account of in my next: but I forgot to tell you, that Charles made his pre&s;ent ye&s;terday to his &s;i&s;ter, of the little &s;tarling, in return for a pocket-book which &s;he had pre&s;ented him with. Emily is already quite fond of her bird. I ne|ver &s;aw &s;o diverting an animal. I wi&s;h my &s;i&s;|ter could &s;ee all the care that Emily takes of it; but I wi&s;h, yet more, to be with her, for then I &s;hould al&s;o be with you, my dear mamma.</P>

<P>WE had not &s;o much plea&s;ure ye&s;terday as we expected, my dear mamma. The weather was very fine at our &s;etting out; but a violent &s;hower of rain coming on, obliged us to take &s;helter, in a very indifferent little inn, whil&s;t the &s;torm la&s;ted.

Well then, I will do my be&s;t, to ac|commodate my&s;elf to every mi&s;chance, that may

befal me. There is one, however, to which I cannot be in&s;en&s;ible; it is that of being &s;epara|ted from you and my little &s;i&s;ter. I &s;tretch forth my arms, to embrace you; without the power of doing it. A thou&s;and times in the day, I fancy that you are doing the &s;ame by me; but, alas! we can only draw near to each other by our &s;en|timents. But what then, are not <HI>they</HI> &s;ufficient|ly lively and tender to re-unite us?</P>

<P>I MUST relate to you, my dear mamma, a droll adventure that befel us la&s;t night.</P>
<P>We had &s;carcely been half an hour in bed, when we heard a great noi&s;e. What is it, &s;aid I, to my friend? I know not, an&s;wered he. Per|haps, &s;aid I, &s;ome thieves may have broken into the hou&s;e. At this in&s;tant, we heard Edward cry out violently. Charles immediately leaped out of bed, ha&s;tily threw &s;omething over him, and &s;eizing his &s;word, Follow me, William, &s;aid he, it is in Edward's chamber. I lighted a candle
<PB N="294" REF="045437_0626_10202BCB4F26DC48">
at our lamp, and we went up into his brother's room, to &s;ee what was the matter. Charles did not di&s;cover the lea&s;t &s;ign of fear; but to con|fe&s;s the truth to you, I trembled all over. On entering the room, we &s;aw Edward lying on the ground under a table, which had fallen on him, with all his books and papers. After having a&s;|&s;i&s;ted in rai&s;ing him up, Charles &s;aid, What is the matter, brother? what has happened to you?</P>

<P>It was the gho&s;t, I tell you.</P>

<P>Tell us then all about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was thus: you know, I do not like to &s;leep with a light in my chamber; I had ju&s;t put out my candle, and got into bed, when I heard &s;omething tread &s;oftly on the floor; I ro&s;e up on my &s;eat, and drawing a&s;ide the cur|tain, &s;aw clearly in the corner of the room, two lights, which appeared &s;ometimes great, &s;ome|times &s;mall, and which moved about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was the dazzling of your eyes, no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>The dazzling of my eyes, indeed! I tell you it was a real object; I &s;aw it as plain as I &s;ee you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what followed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remained perfectly &s;till, hardly daring to breathe; at length the lights were ex|tingui&s;hed, and I heard &s;omething trot about the chamber, and then throw it&s;elf violently again&s;t the door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>William.</SPEAKER>
<P>The mere recital chills me with fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all Charles' &s;teadine&s;s, he would have been as much frightened as I was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why did not you call out for a light?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>How could I? terror had &s;topped my mouth. For a moment all was &s;till: then
<PB N="297" REF="045437_0629_10202BD426470E98">
I heard &s;omething glide again&s;t the wall; and by the pale light of the moon, I &s;aw a great phan|tom, all in white, &s;tanding again&s;t the window-curtain. It &s;eemed every moment to become taller and larger. I put my hand before my eyes, left I &s;hould &s;ee &s;omething &s;till more dread|ful. I crept &s;oftly out of bed, in order to e&s;cape out of the chamber; but the phantom, as it ap|peared to me, began to leap about, and then came up clo&s;e to me: in my fright, I fell again&s;t the table, which I overturned upon me, utter|ing, at the &s;ame time, a loud cry, which was what you heard. But hu&s;h, I think I hear it again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>William.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think &s;o too; I heard &s;omething move by that bureau.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>But a rat is not white; be&s;ides, what I &s;aw was at lea&s;t as big as our great dog in the court-yard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have nothing to do but to &s;earch: if it be here, we &s;hall &s;ee it.</P>
</SP>
<P>Charles immediately began &s;earching into eve|ry corner; under the bed, the bureau, and the drawers; at length he cried out, Here is the gho&s;t; I have found him. And what at la&s;t was this gho&s;t? you will never gue&s;s, my dear mamma: it was no other than a great white cat, belonging to the tenant, which had &s;tolen into the hou&s;e, and ran into Edward's chamber. At the &s;ight of it, we all three bur&s;t into laugh|ter. Charles rallied his brother on his creduli|ty, and the cat made her e&s;cape as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw the door open: Edward appeared, however,
<PB N="298" REF="045437_0630_10202BD713EB22E8">
a little confu&s;ed at this adventure. I cannot comprehend, &s;aid he, how this cat could appear to me of &s;uch a formidable &s;ize. It is the pro|perty of <HI>fear,</HI> an&s;wered Charles, to repre&s;ent things fal&s;ely, and to magnify them to our ima|gination. But the two flambeaus which I &s;aw? They were the eyes of the cat, which appeared, either large or &s;mall, as &s;he opened or &s;hut her eye-lids. Believe me, all the &s;tories that we hear of apparitions are like this of our cat. Could we trace them to their &s;ource, we &s;hould find their cau&s;es quite natural.</P>
<P>After this conver&s;ation, we returned to our beds, and &s;lept very well the remainder of the night. This morning at breakfa&s;t, we diverted Mr. and Mrs. Grandi&s;on with our night-alarm: they be&s;towed great prai&s;es on the coolne&s;s and re&s;olution of Charles. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I never &s;aw his pre&s;ence of mind fail him on any occa|&s;ion. As to Edward, and me, we were not the la&s;t to laugh at our own weakne&s;s: indeed, I am a&s;hamed not to have &s;hewn more courage. I hope, that this little hi&s;tory will &s;erve to amu&s;e my &s;i&s;ter, and to in&s;pire her with more boldne&s;s on a like occa&s;ion, than has been &s;hewn by her brother.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear mamma; you do not write to me &s;o often as I de&s;ire, or as I have occa&s;ion for. Emily talks to me frequently of my &s;i&s;ter: &s;he wants to know, if you are as well &s;atisfied with her as ever. Write particularly about her, I be&s;eech you, both to gratify my own affection, as well as the enquiries of my young friend, who
<PB N="299" REF="045437_0631_10202BDB642CE128">
vouch&s;afes, to intere&s;t her&s;elf for a little girl whom I love &s;o much. Embrace her for me, and convince her how tender the regard is, that I bear her.</P>

<P>I SENSIBLY feel your tender reproach, my dear &s;on, that I do not write to you often enough: were I at liberty to give my&s;elf up to it, no occupation would be more plea&s;ing to me; but you may ea&s;ily conceive how much my time is engaged by the affairs of my family, and the attention that I think it nece&s;&s;ary to pay to your little &s;i&s;ter: I am obliged, you know, to in&s;truct her my&s;elf, not having a fortune &s;ufficient to procure her the in&s;truction of different ma&s;ters. But my cares are well repaid by her happy di&s;|po&s;ition: &s;he learns every thing with the great|e&s;t facility; her indu&s;try is not to be repul&s;ed by any difficulty; and I am every day a&s;toni&s;hed, at the rapid progre&s;s of her under&s;tanding; nor, do
<PB N="300" REF="045437_0632_10202BDE546AE208">
her &s;entiments afford me le&s;s cau&s;e of &s;atisfac|tion. It would be difficult to conceive, a heart, of more rectitude and &s;en&s;ibility. All that you have written, to me, from time to time about E|mily, plea&s;es her infinitely. The pretty letter which this young lady wrote to her mamma, on the &s;ubject of the poor people who &s;uffered by a fire, and of which you &s;ent me a copy, has made a lively impre&s;&s;ion on her. She finds &s;omething to &s;ay about it every day. Oh! my dear mamma, &s;aid &s;he to me ye&s;terday, had I been rich, I would have done like Emily; how much plea&s;ure mu&s;t &s;he have had in relieving tho&s;e poor Mi&s;s Fal|&s;tons! Yes, my child, &s;aid I, &s;he has rea&s;on to be happy, and I am &s;o al&s;o, in &s;eeing you capa|ble of taking part in the troubles of other peo|ple; it is a proof of a good heart: and this di&s;|po&s;ition gives you a right to expect the &s;ame &s;ympathy, in others toward you. The&s;e affec|tionate &s;entiments, are nece&s;&s;ary among mankind, for the mutual con&s;olation of their troubles. This is very true, mamma, &s;aid &s;he, for when I &s;uffer any unea&s;ine&s;s, if my little friends appear afflicted for me, it le&s;&s;ens the evil by one half, at lea&s;t; be&s;ides, I am &s;ure to love them the better for it, and that is always a plea&s;ure. Is not this a very delicate &s;entiment, my dear &s;on, and alto|gether charming for its &s;implicity? I hear &s;uch, continually, from her, which excites in me the tendere&s;t emotions; nor am I le&s;s affected, by tho&s;e which you di&s;play in your letters: I feel that they come from the bottom of your heart; and it is with joy that I receive them back into mine. They &s;often my afflictions, and prove to
<PB N="301" REF="045437_0633_10202BDFF8FFE758">
me that I have not lo&s;t all that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on earth, when I lo&s;t my hu&s;band, &s;ince my children remain to cheri&s;h me with as much tenderne&s;s as I have love for them. Yes, it is to you and your &s;i&s;ter that I commit the care of my happi|ne&s;s. It will not be a painful one to you; for to &s;ee you made happy by your virtues, will not fail to render me &s;o.</P>
<P>All Mrs. Grandi&s;on's letters to me are filled with the mo&s;t flattering accounts of you. The friend&s;hip which has long united us, has, no doubt, its &s;hare in the&s;e encomiums: neverthe|le&s;s, I am willing to believe that you have &s;o lively a &s;en&s;e of her goodne&s;s, as to guard you from doing any thing which may ju&s;tly incur her reprehen&s;ion; it would indeed be &s;hameful in you to de&s;erve it, having before you &s;o perfect a model as Charles. We never love tho&s;e long whom we cannot e&s;teem: continue then to fol|low the good example of your friend. A young man endowed with &s;uch noble qualities, ought to in&s;pire you with a laudable emulation; and there is no way, by which you can repay his ten|derne&s;s, but by endeavouring to make your&s;elf worthy of it.</P>
<P>I &s;ee how much you &s;uffer in not being able to imitate his beneficence. What plea&s;ure &s;hould I feel, could I put it in your power to exerci&s;e this attractive virtue! cultivate it, neverthele&s;s, in your brea&s;t, again&s;t the moment that fortune may enable you to follow the&s;e generous emo|tions; in the mean time, my dear, receive the trifle that I &s;end you: I wi&s;h it were more, but
<PB N="302" REF="045437_0634_10202BE450A43160">
it is all that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of my affairs will permit. I have tran&s;mitted to Mr. Grandi&s;on whatever is wanting for your nece&s;&s;aries: what I &s;end you, is de&s;tined for your plea&s;ures: and the&s;e, I know, con&s;i&s;t in &s;uch things as are mo&s;t worthy of a &s;en&s;ible and generous heart. Fare|well my &s;on. I embrace you with all the tran|&s;ports of a mother, who&s;e felicity depends on the tenderne&s;s and virtues of her children.</P>

<P>A THOUSAND thanks to you, my dear mamma, for the pre&s;ent which you have &s;ent me. A trifle do you call it! permit me to contradict you, in this; I, for my part, think it a great &s;um. You are not rich, and yet you make me a pre&s;ent of two guineas for my plea&s;ure: ten times as much, were you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a large fortune, would be le&s;s to me. But alas! I fear that you may have put your&s;elf to &s;ome incon|venience, in order to enrich me; and this thought interrupts the joy that I feel in receiving the&s;e
<PB N="303" REF="045437_0635_10202BE5D8DF1C78">
marks of your bounty. Be at lea&s;t per&s;uaded, that I am &s;en&s;ible of all the value of this gift, and that I know how to employ it, in a manner with which you will be &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own to you, that I felt a little proud when I related to Emily what you wrote to me of my &s;i&s;ter. I &s;eemed, as if I valued my&s;elf more on her perfections, than on tho&s;e which I might acquire my&s;elf. Emily appeared flattered that her conduct had merited your approbation. She becomes every day more &s;en&s;ible and more amiable. Since my little &s;i&s;ter knows &s;o well how to profit by what I write to you concerning my friend, I will relate to you another adventure which has lately happened to her. I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s freely, that &s;he was a little in fault at the be|ginning, but the conclu&s;ion does her &s;o much honour, that I cannot forbear relating the whole to you as it happened. The poor child was ye&s;terday in the parlour with Edward; they amu&s;ed them&s;elves by turns, in playing little tunes on the harp&s;ichord. You know, there is in this parlour, a japan cabinet, filled with very valuable china. Emily had the curio&s;ity to open it, to look at &s;ome Chine&s;e figures which Mrs. Grandi&s;on had lately pre&s;ented to her. She took one in her hand in order to examine it nearer. Edward, who is ever at &s;ome unlucky trick, cried out, &s;uddenly, mamma is coming. Emily, fearing to be caught in the fact, ha&s;tily put back the china into the cabinet; but in her fear and precipitation, threw down a cup, which broke into a thou&s;and pieces. She was &s;eized with con&s;ternation. It was a cup of great value,
<PB N="304" REF="045437_0636_10202BEA95F3FAD8">
which &s;he knew her mamma pre&s;erved with the utmo&s;t care, as it made part of a &s;et, which was only u&s;ed on particular occa&s;ions. Edward quitted the harp&s;ichord, on hearing Emily cry; and this is the conver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;ed be|tween them.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have done a pretty piece of work there, truly. I would not be in your place for a good deal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>O brother, how can you teaze me &s;o, when you &s;ee how I am di&s;tre&s;&s;ed already? you &s;hould rather give me your advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>What advice can I give you? if you were to go to all the &s;hops in London, you would not find &s;uch another cup as that. You have nothing to do that I know of, but to &s;et off for China, in order to match it.</P>

<P>Emily was ju&s;t going out, when &s;he &s;aw her mamma enter the room: &s;he trembled, and changed colour; and before &s;he was able to &s;peak, bur&s;t into a torrent of tears. She expect|ed a &s;harp reproach: what then was her &s;urprize, when Mrs. Grandi&s;on, who had overheard all that had pa&s;&s;ed, took her tenderly in her arms, and care&s;&s;ing her, &s;aid, you are a good girl, my dear Emily, I do not know what it is that you have broken, but if it be the mo&s;t valuable piece of china in my cabinet, I forgive you, in con&s;i|deration of your courage and frankne&s;s. As for you, Sir, continued &s;he, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Edward, go up into your chamber, and medi|tate on the le&s;&s;on that your young &s;i&s;ter has gi|ven you.

<P>You perceive, mamma, how well Emily was rewarded for not following the bad coun&s;els of Edward; for &s;he would have paid dear for his fal&s;hood, as Mrs. Grandi&s;on had overheard all. The relation of this adventure will not, I think, be u&s;ele&s;s to my &s;i&s;ter; not that I &s;u&s;pect her of ever being capable of deceiving you.

<HEAD>LETTER XII. WILLIAM DANVERS TO HIS MOTHER.</HEAD>
<P>I CONGRATULATE my&s;elf, my dear mamma, on having it in my power, to make you acquainted with a new in&s;tance of the moderation and genero&s;ity of my friend. No, I cannot often enough repeat it. There is not, I believe, in the whole univer&s;e, a young man of &s;o noble a character.</P>
<P>The earl of&mdash;made him a pre&s;ent, a few days ago, of a fine dog, of a very rare and uncommon kind. Young Falkland, one of our neighbours, had before this, a&s;ked the earl &s;eve|ral times to give it to him, but he could not ob|tain it of him, becau&s;e this young man is re|markable for his ill-treatment of his dogs. He
<PB N="308" REF="045437_0640_10202BF4F3D98770">
has no other plea&s;ure than in tormenting them; either by the mo&s;t cruel di&s;cipline, or by encou|raging them to fight till they tear each other to pieces. He has already above a dozen in his hou&s;e: you will think, perhaps, that this was &s;ufficient; but no &s;uch thing: he has be&s;ides a collection of all &s;orts of animals, particularly cats, monkies, and parrots; and with the&s;e crea|tures he pa&s;&s;es one half of the day. He mu&s;t have, methinks, a mo&s;t contracted mind, thus to lavi&s;h his time in &s;uch a mi&s;erable occupation, in&s;tead of devoting it to the &s;tudy of the arts and &s;ciences. Notwith&s;tanding the multitude he has of the&s;e bea&s;ts about him, he was quite en|raged when he found the earl had given his dog to another, after refu&s;ing it to him. What was the con&s;equence of this? Charles had &s;carcely been five days in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, when the poor creature was found dead in a corner of the hou&s;e. It was not till ye&s;terday that we di&s;covered, by means of one of Falkland's &s;ervants, that he had contrived to get him poi&s;oned, out of &s;pite and jealou&s;y. What mon&s;ters are there among mankind! I &s;ay mon&s;ters; the term is not too &s;trong. Yes, my dear mamma, I call him a mon&s;ter, who can deprive another of what he cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf, with no other view than to give him pain. But the following conver&s;a|tion, which pa&s;&s;ed between Edward, Charles and me, as we were walking in the garden ye&s;terday, will &s;hew you how my friend revenged this piece of knavery.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="045437_0641_10202BF7E0D21980">
I was lamenting the death of the poor crea|ture. I am very much afflicted, &s;aid he, al&s;o: I could hardly have believed that the lo&s;s of a dog would have given me &s;o much trouble: but this was an animal of &s;uch &s;ingular beauty, and he was already become quite attached to me.</P>

The air was mild, and the &s;ky &s;erene: nothing was heard on all &s;ides but &s;prightly &s;ongs, accom|panied by the fife and violin. It was a charm|ing &s;ight, to behold between the trees young boys climbing to the highe&s;t branches to gather the fruit, whil&s;t the women and girls received them below in their aprons, in order to fill their ba&s;kets.

<HEAD>LETTER XV. CHARLES GRANDISON TO HIS FRIEND WILLIAM DANVERS.</HEAD>
<P>I DO not yet know, my dear friend, what our journey to London will produce; the be|ginning of our expedition has not been the mo&s;t happy.

We had &s;carcely gone a few miles, before one of our hor&s;es &s;topped &s;hort, and would not advance a &s;tep farther. The po&s;tilli|on, thought to get on by exerci&s;ing his whip, which I could not &s;ee without pain; I cannot bear that &s;o gentle and u&s;eful an animal &s;hould be treated hardly. However, we &s;oon perceived

that the poor creature had met with a hurt in his foot, and that it was not his fault. We were therefore obliged to go gently on to the neare&s;t inn, where we provided our&s;elves with hor&s;es, and pur&s;ued our rout with renewed expedition, till an unlucky accident &s;topped us. In a rug|ged part of the road, the axletree of our chai&s;e &s;uddenly broke: happily we were none of us hurt; but we were obliged to get out of the car|riage, and there being no hou&s;e within a good di&s;tance, we had no other cour&s;e left us, but to walk on foot. I &s;hould have made my&s;elf very ea&s;y under this accident, had it not been for my concern on account of our worthy friend Mr. Bartlet: I feared much le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t his health might &s;uf|fer from the cold and dampne&s;s of the air, and the fatigue of the walk. The &s;un was already &s;et, and we proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eded &s;lowly, followed by our &s;ervant Henry. A violent rain came on. At length, after a half-hour's walk, we perceived to the right, a &s;mall hou&s;e at a little di&s;tance from the road. We were let in by an hone&s;t labour|er, bowed down by the weight of years and hard work, and his wife, who appeared to be as old. We were ho&s;pitably received by this worthy old couple and their children. The elde&s;t &s;on ran to fetch a wheelwright in the neighbourhood, and then went with him to a&s;&s;i&s;t the po&s;tillion in mending the chai&s;e as well as they could; which they could not complete till the evening was far advanced. As it was then too late to pur&s;ue our journey, we re&s;olved to pa&s;s the night in this lit|tle hut, which, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I found as comfortable as the mo&s;t &s;uperb palace.

<P>COULD you ever have gue&s;&s;ed, my dear friend, what could be the object of my journey to this city? Without doubt no, &s;ince I my&s;elf hardly dare now to believe it. Well then, it is by order of the king, who has ju&s;t be|&s;towed on me the po&s;t of page of honour, and inve&s;ted me with a place about his children. I know not to whom I am indebted for the&s;e fa|vours; but they try to per&s;uade me that I owe them to my own conduct. But it &s;eems to me that I have only fulfilled my duty, and that alone de&s;erves no recompen&s;e: I regard therefore what has befallen me, as the pure bounty of heaven; which thus rewards the virtue of my worthy parents. I rejoice more on their account than my own. Mr. Bartlet has written to my papa; you will doubtle&s;s &s;ee his letter. I have &s;carce time to a&s;&s;ure you that I am ever your faithful and affectionate friend,</P>

Major Arthur, who&s;e life was &s;aved by Charles, had repre&s;ented your &s;on to his maje&s;ty in &s;o ad|vantageous a manner, had &s;poken &s;o highly of his good &s;en&s;e, his acquirements and goodne&s;s of heart, as to in&s;pire the king with the de&s;ire of &s;eeing him; and it was after his fir&s;t interview with him that he conferred on him the&s;e fa|vours.</P>
<P>The earl, who introduced Charles to his ma|je&s;ty, and was pre&s;ent at the audience, declared that he never &s;aw any one received &s;o graciou&s;ly. The king him&s;elf, after ordering his children into his pre&s;ence, vouch&s;afed to pre&s;ent them to him. Your amiable &s;on an&s;wered all que&s;tions put to him with a re&s;pectful freedom, and a no|blene&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion quite a&s;toni&s;hing for his age. The young princes were de&s;irous that he &s;hould from that moment remain about them. But he repre&s;ented to them the occa&s;ion there was for his remaining yet &s;ome time in his fa|ther's hou&s;e, in order to profit by his in&s;tructi|ons, and to render him&s;elf more worthy of the high office allotted him.</P>
<P>He owned to me afterwards, that he had ano|ther rea&s;on for a&s;king this delay: it was, that his friend William having only three months more to &s;pend in England, he much wi&s;hed to pa&s;s the remainder of that time with him. Thus you &s;ee, his pre&s;ence of mind never for|&s;akes him; nor can the &s;eductions of fortune make him forget the duties of friend&s;hip.</P>

The earl gave ye&s;terday a grand entertain|ment in honour of your &s;on. Charles received the compliments of all the company with as much grace as dignity. The many prai&s;es be&s;towed on him, excited not in him the lea&s;t emotions of pride; and he left the company all captivated by his amiable qualities. Do not think, my dear friend, that the enthu&s;ia&s;m with which I &s;peak of your &s;on, is the effect of that partiality which I feel for your family: you will find the &s;ame te&s;timonies in his favour in the letter which Lord&mdash;has written you.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>SEPTEMBER 26.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS &s;o impatient, my dear mamma, to &s;end you my friend Charles' letter, and that of Mr. Bartlet, that I had not time to give you tho&s;e reflections which the good fortune of my friend have given birth to in my mind. Indeed, were I to attempt to &s;ay all that I think on this &s;ubject, my letter would not be fini&s;hed to-day. I will therefore confine my&s;elf to the more ea&s;y and delightful ta&s;k, of attempting to de&s;cribe to you, how &s;en&s;ible I am of his faithful remem|brance of our friend&s;hip. What then! Could he, for the &s;ake of my &s;ociety, during the re|mainder of my &s;tay here, re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ires of the young princes, and &s;acrifice all the plea&s;ures of a court! Ah! he has not made this &s;acrifice to an ungrateful friend. You will witne&s;s for me, mamma, how much I ever loved him, that all my letters were filled with expre&s;&s;ions of my tenderne&s;s for him. Well then, he is now be|come a thou&s;and times more dear to me. Du|ring

his ab&s;ence, I have been made too &s;en&s;ible how nece&s;&s;ary he is to my happine&s;s. Notwith|&s;tanding all the care&s;&s;es of Mr. and Mrs. Gran|di&s;on, notwith&s;tanding the friend&s;hip of Edward and Emily, I find that I mi&s;s him every hour in the day. I &s;eem, as if I were but half my&s;elf, without him. I have no other re&s;ource, but to employ my&s;elf continually in doing &s;omething for him. Yes, mamma, all the bu&s;ine&s;s that we did when we were together, I now do alone, in order to render his ab&s;ence le&s;s tedious to me. I have cultivated his garden, and ornamented it with the flowers of the &s;ea&s;on, that he may &s;ee, at his return, what care I have taken, of all that he is intere&s;ted in. I have continued to copy a &s;et of de&s;igns in architecture which he had be|gun: they are not, it is true, &s;o well drawn as he would have done them, but they are better than if I had done them for my&s;elf. I am &s;ure that his friend&s;hip will excu&s;e the weakne&s;s of my pencil, and that he will &s;ee them in his col|lection with plea&s;ure. I have al&s;o tran&s;cribed in|to his mu&s;ic-books, all the new airs which we have had &s;ince his departure. I have arranged the books in his library; I have fed his birds; I have given &s;omething to his poor people: in &s;hort, I have attempted to do all that he would have done him&s;elf. It is at the&s;e times, that I have more than ever felt the force of that maxim, which you have &s;o often repeated to me, that application to bu&s;ine&s;s is the be&s;t means of com|po&s;ing the mind under grief or unea&s;ine&s;s. Ah! had I been condemned to idlene&s;s during this in|terval of my friend's ab&s;ence, how &s;hould I have

<P>Adieu, my dear mamma; now that my friend is &s;o far from me, I doubly feel the pain of be|ing &s;o from you. I have no con&s;olation but in knowing that you love me, and in feeling how much I love you.</P>

<HEAD>THE ADVANTAGES OF INDUSTRY.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Dorville, a rich manufacturer, was the mo&s;t inveterate enemy to idlene&s;s. He not only dedicated the whole day to labour him&s;elf, but took care al&s;o, to have every per&s;on of his family employed in the &s;ame manner. Liberal to all whom age or infirmity had ren|dered incapable of work, but implacable toward tho&s;e idle vagabonds, who, with the advantages of health and &s;trength, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me to beg at his door. He would a&s;k them why they did not work; and if they excu&s;ed them&s;elves, by &s;aying that they could get no employment, he would offer it to them in his manufactory; but after once re|fu&s;ing
<PB N="329" REF="045437_0661_10202C3367911EB0">
it, they dared never more approach his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>He never &s;uffered a bale of goods either to be packed up or opened, without obliging his two &s;ons Francis and Robert, to put their hands to it. He had a large garden behind his hou&s;e, in which he made them both work, under the direction of his gardener: and during winter, he would employ them in turning, and other works of ingenuity. His three daughters, al&s;o, had not more time allowed them for idlene&s;s. They had the charge of the dome&s;tic oeconomy; with every other occupation &s;uitable to their &s;ex.</P>
<P>The better to excite their indu&s;try, Mr. Dor|ville paid each for his work; and tho&s;e among them, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their activity, had an extraordinary reward. The&s;e little perqui&s;ites, they had the liberty of laying out in their own plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>No quarrels or ill humour were ever heard in this family. They enjoyed perfect health, and each day brought with it new plea&s;ures, by making them ta&s;te the &s;weets of their own labours.</P>
<P>If the boys pre&s;ented to their &s;i&s;ters a no&s;egay of carnations or hyacinths, they received from them in return either embroidered ruffles, pur&s;es, or &s;trings for their canes or watches, all, the work of their indu&s;trious hands. If their de&s;&s;erts were furni&s;hed by the fruit of their young trees, which they had planted and grafted them&s;elves, they had the &s;atisfaction to hear their parents
<PB N="330" REF="045437_0662_10202C37CA5700D0">
prai&s;e them, by acquainting their gue&s;ts, to whom they owed their regale; at which, each would take his gla&s;s, and the company in chorus, drank to the health of the little gardener.</P>
<P>Seven days in the year, were celebrated as fe&s;tivals in the family; the&s;e were the birth-days of each of the children, and tho&s;e of their father and mother. Plea&s;ure and mutual tenderne&s;s reigned on tho&s;e occa&s;ions: particularly on the birth-days of their parents, when they generally gave an entertainment to the children, to which they invited their young acquaintance. The fea&s;t always ended in a ball, at which youthful vivacity, heightened by mu&s;ic, animated every look and motion, whil&s;t their fond parents be|held, with tran&s;ports of joy, their playful gaiety and natural graces.</P>
<P>Who would believe, that the&s;e children &s;hould ever grow weary of a way of life &s;o full of plea&s;ure? This was, however, the ca&s;e. Francis one day went to pay a vi&s;it to his young cou&s;ins: he returned home with a &s;orrowful contenance. His father, from &s;ome indirect words which he let fall, comprehended at once the cau&s;e of his chagrin: he, however, did not appear as if he ob&s;erved it: In the mean while, as Francis wore the &s;ame face of &s;adne&s;s the next day, Mr. Dorville having engaged him to take a walk with him after dinner, over his plantations, they had together the following conver&s;ation.</P>

Mr. Dorville willingly con&s;ented. They went together, and &s;eated them&s;elves at the top of a hill, from whence they had a view of the &s;urrounding country. It was in the early part of the &s;pring. The meadows, which but a month before were buried in &s;now, now di&s;played the mo&s;t lively verdure. The woods were covered with tender foliage, and the fruit-trees adorned with the gaye&s;t blo&s;&s;oms. The har&s;h whi&s;tling of the north-wind, no more grated on the ear;

nothing was heard around, but the &s;weet warb|ling of birds, Young lambs, and playful colts were &s;een &s;porting in the rich pa&s;ture-grounds. Echo re&s;ounded with the cheerful &s;ong of the labourer, as he trod the furrowed land The roads were filled with troops of country-people; &s;ome conducting their waggons loaded with corn, wine, and other merchandize; others carrying on their &s;houlders ba&s;kets filled with herbs and flowers. The young milk maids &s;eemed to walk in cadence: all bent their &s;teps toward the city, the gates of which were ju&s;t opened to receive them.

<P>Oh yes, I have in my garden above a dozen young trees which I have planted and grafted my&s;elf; all my beds are furni&s;hed with good vegetables, and my borders with fine flowers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that all, my dear?</P>

<P>No indeed, papa; I have in my chamber a great cupboard full of my workman|&s;hip in &s;traw and pa&s;teboard, be&s;ides a thou&s;and little toys of ivory and ebony, that I turned in my lathe.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why, papa, &s;o long as I &s;ee my cup|board furni&s;hed with the fruits of my labours, whil&s;t I gather no&s;egays for my &s;i&s;ters, or fine fruits, and good vegetables to pre&s;ent to my mo|ther, I find my&s;elf &s;o happy, that I no longer think of the trouble that the&s;e things co&s;t me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is but a very little thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, it appears from your own account, that play only amu&s;es the pre&s;ent moment, and that it does not even always do that in proportion to our expectations; and that work, on the contrary, after having agreeably occupied us, leaves behind it &s;ome u&s;eful enjoy|ment. After twenty years are pa&s;t, you will have a renewed plea&s;ure in gathering fruits from the trees which your hands have planted, though you will, by that time, forget all your fri|volous pa&s;times. Decide therefore, your&s;elf, which affords the mo&s;t &s;olid plea&s;ure, u&s;eful labour, or vain amu&s;ement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! papa, according to the light in which you have &s;et the thing, there is no room to balance. Labour, without di&s;pute, renders us mo&s;t happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;ee then, it was not with|out rea&s;on that I have urged you to follow it. Were I to &s;ay to you, come, Francis, work no more; I will have you &s;pend your whole time at play. Would it not be making you mi&s;erable for the re&s;t of your life?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes, I can feel this now: every different play would &s;oon become tedious and in&s;upportable to me.</P>

<P>Pray do, papa; I &s;hall be glad to hear it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>A young gentleman in Ger|many paid his addre&s;&s;es to a very amiable lady, and a&s;ked her in marriage of her father. The father &s;aid to him, I will give you my daughter very willingly, but have you a good trade to maintain her and her children? A trade, Sir, an&s;wered the young gentleman? are you igno|rant that I po&s;&s;e&s;s a large country-&s;eat in your neighbourhood, with a con&s;iderable e&s;tate be|&s;ides? All this is nothing, replied the father of the lady; your hou&s;e may be burnt, your land may &s;uffer deva&s;tation; be&s;ides this, many other ruinous accidents may happen to you, which I cannot fore&s;ee. In a word, if you wi&s;h to ob|tain my daughter, you mu&s;t learn &s;ome trade, or I &s;hall not be &s;atisfied. It is the ab&s;olute con|dition of our alliance. It was in vain that the young gentleman remon&s;trated: the father would not recede. What was to be done? he loved the lady too pa&s;&s;ionately to give her up. He put him&s;elf apprentice therefore to a ba&s;ket-maker, the ea&s;ie&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s he could think of; and it was not till after he had made a very neat ba&s;ket, and &s;ome other pieces of workman&s;hip, before the
<PB N="346" REF="045437_0678_10202C556064D4D8">
eyes of her father, that he could obtain the la|dy.</P>
</SP>
<P>During the fir&s;t years of his marriage, he laughed inwardly at the fore&s;ight of his father-in-law, and the whim&s;ical condition which he had impo&s;ed upon him; but he had &s;oon occa|&s;ion to &s;ee the matter in a much more &s;erious light.</P>
<P>War was declared: the enemy entered his province. They ravaged his lands; cut down his fore&s;ts; demoli&s;hed his ca&s;tle; pillaged his ef|fects; and obliged him and his family to take flight: our rich gentleman found him&s;elf all at once reduced to indigence. At fir&s;t he did no|thing but deplore his ill-fortune, living with dif|ficulty on the little money that he had &s;aved: but this re&s;ource &s;oon failed him. He then be|thought him&s;elf of the trade which he had learn|ed. His &s;pirits began to recover, and he gave him&s;elf up to work with the more ardour, as he had taken refuge in a city where his name and rank were unknown. His wife, between the intervals of her dome&s;tic occupations, comforted him under his labours. The children were em|ployed to &s;ell the ba&s;kets which he made. In this manner, he provided decently for the &s;upport of him&s;elf and family, until the happy moment arrived, which by the return of peace, re&s;tored him again to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his fortune.</P>
<P>This &s;tory made a lively impre&s;&s;ion on Fran|cis. He related it him&s;elf to his brother and &s;i&s;ters, who were al&s;o as much taken with it. It put them upon making a number of reflections on the wi&s;dom of providing re&s;ources again&s;t the
<PB N="347" REF="045437_0679_101FFD1ADE65A590">
unexpected turns of fortune. Alas! they did not then fore&s;ee that they &s;oon would have occa|&s;ion to apply this to them&s;elves. A little time after, a fire broke out in the night in one of Mr. Dorville's magazines; and all the buildings be|longing to his manufactory were con&s;umed be|fore any a&s;&s;i&s;tance could be got to &s;top the flames. Another man might have been ca&s;t down by this di&s;a&s;ter; but, on the contrary, it &s;erved only to fortify his re&s;olution, and redouble his activity. All his friends were eager to &s;upport him. His indu&s;try made the be&s;t u&s;e of the&s;e advantages, by labouring to repair his lo&s;&s;es. Nor did this rever&s;e of fortune prevent his daughters from being &s;ought in marriage by the riche&s;t and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible men; becau&s;e they knew, that, in them they &s;hould find women capable of conducting the affairs of their hou&s;e, with oeconomy and prudence. As for his two &s;ons, they applied them&s;elves with &s;uch indefatigable ardour to bu|&s;ine&s;s, that, in a few years their affairs were not only re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, but carried to a degree of pro&s;perity, which they had never known before that misfortune which &s;eemed to have over|thrown them for ever.</P>

<P>O MY dear mamma, what danger my friend Charles has been in! Alas! I have been within a little of lo&s;ing him! I tremble yet whil&s;t I think of it. What would have become of me if he had been as brutal as his adver&s;ary; if he had either lo&s;t his life, or taken away that of his antagoni&s;t, and been obliged to fly his country? Happily all has terminated to his ho|nour; whil&s;t he is pre&s;erved to his family, and to his friend, he has given us fre&s;h rea&s;on to love and e&s;teem him. But I am too long without &s;a|tisfying your curio&s;ity: read, pray read the let|ter which Mr. Grandi&s;on has ju&s;t received from Mr. Bartlet. I have &s;pent the whole evening in tran&s;cribing it in order to &s;end it to you. Oh! my dear mamma, how many times has my heart beat whil&s;t I was taking this copy! But it is not of me that it &s;peaks; forget me, I pray you, for a few moments, that you may be the more at li|berty to attend to my friend.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN never &s;ufficiently congratulate you on the happine&s;s of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch a &s;on as your's. I was witne&s;s ye&s;terday, without his knowing it, to an adventure which does him in|finite honour. But why &s;hould I be a&s;toni&s;hed at his conduct, when I only &s;ee, in it, the effect of the good example and wi&s;e le&s;&s;ons which he has received from you! We fell in company ye&s;terday with a Mr. Stukely, &s;on to Lord G&mdash;, a young man of a mo&s;t violent and brutal cha|racter: though he is but eighteen years of age, he is devoured by ambition and envy. I had already ob&s;erved, that he was jealous of the po&s;t which your &s;on had obtained. He threw out many &s;piteful &s;arca&s;ms, which Charles, with ad|mirable &s;elf-command, pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. They engaged in a game of piquet together. Stukely, like a bully, took advantage of your &s;on's moderation, pluming him&s;elf on a fal&s;e cou|rage
<PB N="350" REF="045437_0682_10202B4BD1A2E098">
He took occa&s;ion to quarrel with him at play, in &s;o pointed a manner, that Charles could not refrain from &s;hewing his indignation, by his looks. I will give you their conver&s;ation, word for word.</P>

to follow them, as I perceived, plainly, that Stuke|ly meant to pick a quarrel. They walked at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other, toward a little grove at the farther end of the garden.

<P>After having embraced, the two young men returned back together into the hou&s;e. Nobody knew any thing of this adventure. It redounds as much to the honour of your &s;on, as to the di&s;grace of his adver&s;ary; had he not in &s;ome &s;ort repaired it, by the la&s;t part of his behaviour. Throughout the whole of this delicate circum|&s;tance, Charles manife&s;ted a courage, without ra&s;hne&s;s, and moderation, without weakne&s;s. Though young and unarmed, he knew how to bring his adver&s;ary to terms, by the force of his rea&s;ons. In a word, I know not which the mo&s;t to admire in him, his prudence, or his in|trepidity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. WILLIAM DANVERS TO HIS MOTHER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>OCTOBER 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY friend Charles is at length returned, my dear mamma. What was our joy at &s;eeing him again. The moment of his return &s;erved as a &s;ignal for a fea&s;t. Without &s;aying any thing to Mr. Grandi&s;on, the young boys of the village had erected, with the boughs of trees, a triumphal arch at the entrance of the avenue. The young girls, in their be&s;t attire, waited with ba&s;kets of flowers, which they &s;trewed before him. It was by a cry of, Long live Charles Grandi&s;on, that his approach was fir&s;t announced to us. We immediately ran to meet him, Mrs. Grandi&s;on leading the way. He threw him&s;elf out of the carriage into the arms of his parents. Mrs. Grandi&s;on pre&s;&s;ed him to her heart, bath|ing him with her tears; and Mr. Grandi&s;on, as he embraced him, &s;trove in vain to conceal his. As for Emily, her arms &s;eemed fa&s;tened round his neck; and Edward, al&s;o, was much rejoiced: though the elde&s;t, he &s;eemed to look up to his brother with a kind of re&s;pect. But, mamma, I
<PB N="357" REF="045437_0689_10202B5EF88D6EA8">
cannot de&s;cribe to you what I felt. I wept, I &s;ighed, as if I had been in trouble; whil&s;t my heart was filled with the mo&s;t lively joy. Ah! when it came to my turn to embrace him, how clo&s;ely did I hold him in my arms! I thought of you at the &s;ame time. Ah! &s;aid I to my&s;elf, if I could but this moment carry my friend into the pre&s;ence of my mamma! The &s;ervants ran backward and forward, crying out with joy. They would have given the world to have em|braced and ki&s;&s;ed him as we did. No one was ever beloved like him; nor was any one ever &s;o worthy of it. All the country-people came ye&s;|terday evening, and danced under our windows; and to-night, there was a general illumination throughout the village.</P>
<P>Charles has received this morning the compli|ments of all the neighbouring nobility. What an honour at his age! But he is not rendered proud by it: on the contrary, he is more mode&s;t than before. Is not this the be&s;t proof in the world that he is worthy of his dignity?</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as we were &s;itting down to table, the old gardener (Matthews) came in: he is the hu&s;band of Mrs. Grandi&s;on's nur&s;e. He lives about three miles off, on a pen&s;ion allowed him by Mr. Grandi&s;on, upon which he pa&s;&s;es a happy old age. He advanced &s;lowly on his crutches to pay his compliments. Charles &s;aw him at the end of the avenue, and ran to meet him. He took him by the hand, and brought him to his mo|ther. He made him &s;it down to table next to him&s;elf. You &s;ee, mamma, that honours have not changed the nature of my friend. A young
<PB N="358" REF="045437_0690_10202B61EF1DF360">
of honour makes an old gardener &s;it by his &s;ide, and &s;erves him all dinner-time! Not that I &s;aw any thing &s;o extraordinary in this, but I could perceive, that Edward was inwardly a&s;to|ni&s;hed at it. I do not know how it is, &s;aid he to his brother after dinner, but this vi&s;it of Mat|thews &s;eemed to give you more plea&s;ure than all the re&s;t. It is true, an&s;wered Charles: the words of this hone&s;t man are not made up of vain compliments; they come from the heart. He would not, at his age, have walked three miles on his crutches to congratulate me, if he had not been &s;incerely rejoiced at my good for|tune; and be&s;ides, ought I not to love him who had the care of dear mamma's infancy? I am &s;ure, he loves her as if &s;he was his own daugh|ter. Charles was in the right; for during the whole meal, I had my eyes fixed upon this good old man; and though he was in the gaye&s;t &s;pi|rits, I could frequently ob&s;erve his eyes filled with tears, when he turned them toward Mrs. Grandi&s;on. The worthy Matthews wi&s;hed to return home early, becau&s;e of the length of the walk; but in order to enjoy his company long|er, Charles ea&s;ily prevailed on his father to &s;end him back in his carriage.</P>
<P>You may well imagine, my dear mamma, that I could not be witne&s;s to all the&s;e &s;cenes, without figuring to my&s;elf the happy day on which I &s;hall return to you. Alas! I &s;hall have no place or dignities to bring back to you, but I &s;hall at lea&s;t have done all in my power to bring you back a heart le&s;s unworthy of your affection. No illuminations will celebrate my return; but
<PB N="359" REF="045437_0691_10202B6377C32D50">
I &s;hall &s;ee your eyes, and tho&s;e of my &s;i&s;ter, &s;hine through their tears with all the brightne&s;s of joy. I &s;hall receive no flattering compliments on the advancement of my fortune, but I &s;hall receive from your mouth the words of love; I &s;hall receive your ki&s;&s;es and care&s;&s;es. I do not envy my friend the favours be&s;towed on him by the bounty of heaven: I feel, that be de&s;erves them better, than I. But when I &s;ee him in the arms of his mother, I a&s;k why am not I in tho&s;e of my dear mamma. I have nothing but you to love on earth, and I am far from you. You are all my riches, and I po&s;&s;e&s;s you not. Oh! mamma, my dear mamma? I mu&s;t break off: I mu&s;t not give my&s;elf up to the&s;e cruel reflections! I &s;hould have &s;trength enough, perhaps, to &s;up|port them for my&s;elf alone, but not for you. It is not my own grief which I fear, it is your's. I &s;hould not dread afflictions, were it not for the fear of afflicting you.</P>
