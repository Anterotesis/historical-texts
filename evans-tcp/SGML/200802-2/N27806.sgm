<HEAD>A SERMON, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>CONVENED for the purpo&s;e of making &s;ome &s;uitable reflections, upon the death of GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON; the Man who, in life, was highly ven|erable, amiable and beloved; and who, in his death, is great|ly lamented, and univer&s;ally honored by public and re&s;pect|ful ceremonies;&mdash;the following pathetic and ejaculatory Aphori&s;m of I&s;rael's in&s;pired King, is highly applicable to the occa&s;ion: "HELP, LORD; for the GODLY MAN cea|&s;eth; for the FAITHFUL fail from among the CHILDREN of MEN."</P>
<BIBL>PSALMS, CHAP. xii. VERSE 1.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALL terre&s;tial things and beings are of a tran&s;itory and peri&s;hable nature. Even the Sun, that bright emblem of the Deity, which has for ages &s;hone with undi&s;tingui&s;hable lu&s;tre upon &s;urrounding worlds, mu&s;t at length cea&s;e to &s;hine, and be removed from its exalted &s;tation; among the &s;hining worlds in the expanded firmament.&mdash;The principles of de|cay and di&s;&s;olution, are in&s;eperably connected with all the vi&s;ible objects of nature.</P>
<P>THAT all the human race are mortal is a truth which neither the godly, nor the ungodly di&s;pute. The mo&s;t wi&s;e and amiable and the mo&s;t godly and e&s;teemed of men, can|not be exempted from the &s;troke of death. To death, the rich as well as the poor, the noble as well as the ignomini|ous, mu&s;t &s;ubmit and bow. Neither the virtues nor honors of WASHINGTON, could &s;ecure him from the arre&s;t of death.&mdash;WASHINGTON, the faithful and godly, has fallen; &mdash;he is removed from us into the world of &s;pirits,&mdash;it &s;hould therefore be the prayer of United Columbia, Help, or &s;ave us O Lord, for the godly Man hath cea&s;ed; for the faithful Man from among us has failed!</P>
<P>THE death of the wi&s;e and virtuous in public life, is a ju&s;t cau&s;e of public lamentation, &s;orrow and prayer. Tho' all things and beings are under the wi&s;e and &s;overeign direction
<PB N="6" REF="037056_0004_100C31EFDFCF1100">
of HIM "who&s;e kingdom ruleth over all,"&mdash;and tho it be the duty of all mankind to &s;ubmit to the events of his prov|idence as ju&s;t and right, yet when per&s;ons of eminent worth and u&s;efulne&s;s, of &s;ingular piety and goodne&s;s, are taken out of the world, it is lawful to expre&s;s grief, and to mourn that they are no more. When per&s;ons of this character, in pub|lic life, are taken away by death, it cannot be di&s;plea&s;ing to the Holy Governor of the univer&s;e, to &s;ee tho&s;e of the &s;ame community or nation, noticing with religious ceremonies, &s;uch an event of his providence, and re&s;pecting their virtues by public te&s;timonies of veneration. This may be done with all due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his holy government, and to the particular in&s;tance of his providence, by which their &s;orrow and mourning are united.</P>
<P>As the venerable Man, who&s;e death we now lament, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of extraordinary virtues, and was more than uncom|monly u&s;eful in public life,&mdash;it becomes the &s;ons and daugh|ters of Columbia, to unite in public te&s;tamonies of grief, and in public ceremonies of re&s;pect for his memory.</P>
<P>"THE ILLUSTRIOUS GENERAL GEORGE WASHING|TON IS DEAD." Let COLUMBIA be clothed in an HA|BILIMENT of MOURNING. He has died, as expre&s;&s;ed in the public Papers, "mature in years, covered with glory, and rich in the affection of the American people."</P>
<P>HOWEVER the Citizens of United America have been, and are yet divided in their political &s;entiments,&mdash;yet con|cerning the death of the illu&s;trious WASHINGTON, they lay a&s;ide their divi&s;ions and animo&s;ity, and are united in paying a public re&s;pect to the talents, u&s;efulne&s;s, virtues and memory of this their departed Hero.&mdash;In all our populous towns, the &s;everal Hou&s;es of public wor&s;hip, have been dre&s;&s;ed in mourn|ing, while the Bells, with &s;olemn &s;ound, have announced that &s;ome public Calamity has come upon our country: And what is the Calamity? Have either famines, earthquakes, or epidemic di&s;orders, become the cau&s;e of the&s;e public te&s;timo|nies of &s;orrow and mourning? No! "The illu&s;trious LEADER; the SOLDIERS FRIEND; the FATHER of his COUNTRY," is forever removed from this &s;ublunary world. Numerous are the Orations, Sermons, and Eulogies, which have been pronounced, in honor to his &s;uperior talents and virtues:&mdash;And in the commemoration and celebration of which, numerous hymns, p&s;alms, and dirges, have been &s;ung in &s;olemn &s;trains:&mdash;The vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic, which have been performed on the occa&s;ion, have &s;mitten the mind
<PB N="7" REF="037056_0005_100C3E2D942EF248">
with pungent angui&s;h, while they have cau&s;ed reflections highly u&s;eful and important. The &s;everal funeral proce&s;|&s;ions and military honors, which have been formed, as public te&s;timonies of &s;orrow for the melancholy event of his death, are calculated to teach us the uncertainty and final <HI>End</HI> of all worldly greatne&s;s and honors.</P>
<P>AMONG the many public tributes of re&s;pect with which he has been honored in his death the &s;peaker will now hum|bly attempt, to &s;hew that he was, according to the text, "A Godly and faithful man."</P>
<P>WITH one voice, all the true Citizens of United Colum|bia, who re&s;pect the divine government over mankind, mu&s;t readily unite in this &s;olemn and pathetic Addre&s;s to God, "Help, Lord; for the godly man cea&s;eth; for the faithful fail from among us."&mdash;</P>
<P>WHATEVER might have cau&s;ed the pious king of I&s;rael, to make this addre&s;s, none of us can be in&s;en&s;ible of its ap|plication to the death of Wa&s;hington, the Hero, the Sage, and Patriot of United America.</P>
<P>HE was a Godly-man, becau&s;e he always re&s;pected &amp; vin|cated the character and government of the Supreme Ruler of the Univer&s;e.&mdash;He was never known to trifle with the names by which the Creator and Governor of the world is di&s;tingui&s;hed from other beings. He always reverenced his &s;acred names, titles, and attributes; and of things &s;acred he always &s;pake with &s;olemnity and reverence. It has been remarked by tho&s;e who have had a per&s;onal acquaintance with him, and who have attended him both in the private and public walks of life, that he never took the name of the Lord God in vain. His countenance indicated a &s;olemn mind, and all his private and public actions manife&s;ted that he was a Godly-man.</P>
<P>IN his public addre&s;&s;es, and in his an&s;wers to the many thou&s;and which he has received, and e&s;pecially in his FARE|WELL ADDRESS to the people when he la&s;t retired into pri|vate life, his <HI>Piety</HI> is evidently di&s;covered. With Godly rev|erence, he always mentioned the Divine government, relat|ed the Divine goodne&s;s and expre&s;&s;ed the Divine ble&s;&s;ing, confer'd on the American Nation.</P>
<P>AMIDST all the honors which his fellow Citizens could confer upon him, and while living in the mo&s;t affluent cir|cum&s;tances, his heart and affections a&s;pired to things of a more glorious and duriable nature. He lived as being fully &s;en&s;ible of the uncertain and tran&s;itory nature of all human
<PB N="8" REF="037056_0006_100C3E2FA2811D58">
greatne&s;s and glory. He lived as one who lived not to him|&s;elf, but to the glory of his Creator, and for the good of his fellow creatures. His heart was enlivened by pious affec|tions; his mind enlarged with exalted conceptions of Jeho|vah and his providences; and his conduct made amiable by a cour&s;e of uniformity and virtue. Realizing the view and glory of making the people of the&s;e United States virtuous and happy, under an equitable Con&s;titution and Govern|ment, in their National exi&s;tence and independence; and animated by the hope of leaving virtuous examples of mar|&s;hall heroi&s;m, and of a ju&s;t admini&s;tration in the high de|partment of Government, both legi&s;lative and executive, he encounter'd the greate&s;t dangers, and cheerfully pa&s;&s;ed thro' many trying &s;cenes. Endeavouring to promote the honor and kingdom of Jehovah in the world, he has le&s;t a name, which will be revered by the virtuous of &s;ucceeding ages. In all the dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es with which he has been &s;ur|rounded, he has found abundant con&s;olation in the applau&s;e of a good con&s;cience, and e&s;pecially in the rea&s;onable ex|pectation of having the approbation of the Supreme Ruler of all nations. Such con&s;olations &s;hall &s;urvive the wreck of worlds and ages: "they are independent &s;olaces" far be|yond the reach of time's de&s;troying power. The&s;e, in a degree, the Godly of all ranks and &s;tations enjoy; and for them, with the mo&s;t &s;ervent zeal, we &s;hould all a&s;pire.</P>
<P>PERSUADED that Jehovah governs the world, with the mo&s;t perfect wi&s;dom and holine&s;s, ju&s;tice and benignity, and that all his requirements of mankind are perfectly ju&s;t and holy, this godly Man lived &s;uperior to all tho&s;e altercations and divi&s;ions which have been rai&s;ed, and for ages carried on by religious bigots. Sen&s;ible that modes of faith and religi|ous &s;entiment were of no importance, only as they tended to promote true benevolence, kindne&s;s, charity, and virtue among mankind, &mdash;his religion, was con&s;tituted in &s;upreme reverence for the character, perfections and government of Jehovah, and of univer&s;al "good will to man."</P>
<P>THO' he was a profe&s;&s;or of religion in the Church of England, yet it is evident that he was a &s;incere believer in the ab&s;olute unity of the Deity, as di&s;connected from all human opinions, and inventions, with which the doctrine has long been taught, and handed down from one generation to another.</P>
<P>BELIEVING that there were virtuous per&s;ons, among the &s;ev|eral cla&s;&s;es &amp; different denomination of people in the United
<PB N="9" REF="037056_0007_100C3E312B41CE88">
States, and unwilling to dictate others in their religious &s;en|timents, he in his Proclamation for a day of public Thank&s;|giving in the year ninety-five, called on the people to ex|pre&s;s their gratitude to the ONE ONLY SUPREME over all, on account of his wonderful goodne&s;s manife&s;ted to them as a nation. He &s;aid nothing about any particular &s;y&s;tem of religion, or any of the controver&s;al doctrines among Chri&s;|tians, and others: But he fully expre&s;&s;ed the great funda|mentals of all religion; &s;uch as the acknowledgement of the exi&s;tence, perfections, and providence of Jehovah; the gra|titude due to him for all his ble&s;&s;ings, both of a public and private nature; and our obligations to Him, as al&s;o our hap|pine&s;s, in the regulations of our affections and conduct by a faithful obedience to the demands of that religion, which requires repentance and an implicit reliance upon the Di|vine mercy for the pardon of &s;in, and for every temporal and &s;piritual favor. He was therefore GODLY by the exerci&s;e of univer&s;al CHARITY and "GOODWILL" which are directly oppo&s;ed to the di&s;po&s;ition and conduct of tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ors of religion, who confine their charity and GOODWILL to tho&s;e only of their peculiar &s;entiments. As &s;uch characters are &s;o few in the world, e&s;pecially in public life, we have the highe&s;t rea&s;on to mourn for the lo&s;s of the Man of this char|acter, who has lately fallen in death:&mdash;With the utmo&s;t propriety may we pray as in the words of the text, "Help, LORD; for this godly man hath cea&s;ed; for this faithful Man hath failed from among us."</P>
<P>THAT WASHINGTON, who is ju&s;tly &s;tiled the illu&s;trious, was faithful, in the exerci&s;e of that power and confidence re|po&s;ed in him, is a fact too evident to be denied by his great|e&s;t enemies. In what in&s;tance, has he ever acted incon|&s;i&s;tent with his dignified and exalted &s;tation? Did he ever abu&s;e the power with which he was intru&s;ted? Or, Did he ever betray the high and important TRUST committed to him, by the united &s;uffrages of his fellow Citizens? The greate&s;t error which has ever been attributed to him in his public admini&s;tration, was the &s;igning the Briti&s;h treaty. But as we have the highe&s;t rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that he was &s;incere in this act, the enemies to the Treaty, &s;hould &s;pare cen&s;ure, and be candid and charitable, when &s;peaking of this in&s;tance of his public conduct.</P>
<P>POSSESSED of all the honors and powers which his Coun|try could be&s;tow upon him; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an Independent fortune, can we conceive of any motive, by which he could
<PB N="10" REF="037056_0008_100C3E32B7D54620">
have been induced, to &s;ign &s;uch a public In&s;trument, either to aggrandize or enrich him&s;elf:&mdash;On the contrary, Have we not every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that he was actuated in this in&s;tance from a &s;incere and di&s;intere&s;ted regard for the public good? What the con&s;equences might have been, if the Treaty had not been ratified by his public &s;anction, it is <HI>now</HI> impo&s;&s;ible for us to determine: Perhaps much greater depredations on our commerce, and war deva&s;tation, and blood&s;hed among us. But we will &s;pare our conjectures, while we con&s;ider him as having the general good of his country at heart, when to the Treaty he put his public &s;anct|ion. As the treaty is approbated by a Majority of both branches of Government, and by the Majority of the people, a certain deference is due to their opinion and judgment from the Minority.</P>
<P>A MAN elevated to the exalted &s;tation in which the Ven|erable MAN, who&s;e death we now deplore, was; and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing the power with which he was intru&s;ted, might have been wholly actuated, in his public conduct, from the &s;elfi&s;h principles of avarice and ambition. Hi&s;tory is filled with unnumbered evils of &s;ceptered ambition and avarice, abu&s;ed power and domination. Hi&s;tory teaches us the fatal effects of the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, avarice, and ambition of Rulers both in the cabinet and field. Many of the Kings of I&s;rael, &s;everal of the Roman Emperors, &s;uch as Nero and Caligula, with in|numerable others of almo&s;t all the kingdoms and nations of the world, have converted their &s;upreme magi&s;tracy and au|thority, into engines of oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty, and for the accompli&s;hment of the mo&s;t tyrannical and &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es. Such characters have ever been the greate&s;t in&s;truments of national profligacy and de&s;truction. Jeroboam, King of I&s;|rael, finned, and made his nation to &s;in. Hence we find it repeatedly &s;aid in the hi&s;tory of the wicked Kings of I&s;rael, He "did like unto Jereboam, King of I&s;rael, who made I&s;|rael to &s;in." This character is applicable to every wicked ruler. Such characters in their public admini&s;tration, cau&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive laws; burthen&s;ome taxes; injurious promotions; cau&s;ele&s;s ejections from office; cruel executions, internal deva&s;tation; and foreign domination. From the conduct and example of &s;uch rulers, profligacy and ruin &s;pread through the community, and &s;top the &s;treams of national health and glory. But how very different were the public mea&s;ures and admini&s;tration of the illu&s;trious Per&s;onage, who&s;e death we now lament. Was he ever known to be cap|tivated
<PB N="11" REF="037056_0009_100C3E35083D4C78">
by the &s;plendor of dignity? or wrongly allur'd by the dazzling effects of honnor &amp; influence? Was he ever know to di&s;tribute ju&s;tice with an uneven balance? Was virtue ever oppo&s;ed by his conduct, or di&s;countenanced by his examples? Did he ever de&s;ignedly elevate the vicious to &s;tations which claim re&s;pect and confidence? Are not the whole of this a&s;&s;embly, and indeed the millions of confederated America, ready to reply with one voice, No! &mdash;Where in our own Country, or indeed in any other Country, can we find anoth|er &s;uch a Character, &s;o illu&s;trious and u&s;eful, whom Heaven has &s;elected for an in&s;trument of &s;uch public good? Impel|led by &s;imilar emotions, the whole American nation are now in mourning for the lo&s;s of a Man <HI>&s;o</HI> "godly and faith|ful." He was a Job, for patience, in danger and di&s;tre&s;s; a Mo&s;es, for a national Deliverer and Saviour; a Jo&s;hua for a Commander of a numerous and re&s;pectable Army, in de|fence of his Country's rights and liberty; and a David for the public admini&s;tration of the con&s;titution and government of an highly favoured nation. Such an a&s;&s;emblage of hero|ic and religious virtues, were never found in any human char|acter before. Grecian nor Roman Annals, have never de|lineated &s;uch exalted virtues and talents, in the lines of any of their boa&s;ted and deified heroes, legi&s;lators or philo&s;ophers. Under the &s;uperintending providence of JEHOVAH who ex|alteth &amp; humbleth nations, he has done more than any other man, "in founding this our wide &s;preading Empire," and in e&s;tabli&s;hing in this we&s;tern world a grea &amp; independent nation.</P>
<P>IN a period of the deepe&s;t calamity, he was appointed Commander in chief of the united army of the <HI>then</HI> thirteen States of America; in which &s;tation he always acted with undaunted courage and uniform dignity. With a heroi&s;m and military wi&s;dom wholly unprecedented, and in dangers the mo&s;t difficult, trying and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, he has been in&s;tru|mental of e&s;tabli&s;hing our national exi&s;tence, independence and greatne&s;s. Having accompli&s;hed the great and highly important OBJECT, for which he was appointed the Com|mander in chief of the American armies, he according to the elegant language of prophecy, converted the implements of war, &s;uch as the &s;word into the plough&s;hare and the &s;pear in|to the pruning hook; and with cheerfulne&s;s, retired into pri|vate life. But as &s;oon as it became obvious that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary and highly expedient that there &s;hould be a con&s;titu|tion founded, and a general Government e&s;tabli&s;hed for the United States, he again, at his country's call, for&s;ook the re|tirements of dome&s;tic life, and in a time of political convul|&s;ions,
<PB N="12" REF="037056_0010_100C3E382943F700">
when a National &s;torm had ari&s;en, came forward into public view; and with virtue and honor, pre&s;ided over the confederated States of America, as their fir&s;t and chief Ma|gi&s;trate. At the clo&s;e of the la&s;t term for which he was elect|ed to the chief Magi&s;tracy of the United States, he volunta|rily choo&s;e to retire again into the private walks of life, even when his unanimous "re-election could not have been doubted."&mdash;But as &s;oon as his beloved Country, was again in danger, by the threatenings and a&s;&s;aults of foreign ene|mies, he was ready to &s;tep forward in its defence. He therefore accepted accordingly the appointment and office of Lieutenant General of the American Armies; in the di&s;|charge of which office he was faithful unto death.</P>
<P>HENCE, "by the purity of his character," and by a long &s;eries of the mo&s;t important &s;ervices of a public nature, he has rendered him&s;elf illu&s;trious, not only in this Country, but throughout the World.&mdash; He always acted in &s;uch a man|ner, as naturally tended to allure others to the practice of vir|tue and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and not to vice and licentiou&s;ne&s;s. In the &s;hade of retirement, in the field, in the cabinet, and in the chair of State, he was re&s;pectable and virtuous. He was "a Lion in the day of battle, and great and powerful in command." The gentlene&s;s and &s;implicity of his manners, and his virtuous and amiable conduct, united in forming a character truly grand and illu&s;trious: a character which was calculated to command attention and in&s;pire confidence. His natural genious, acquired talents and virtues; brought him at an uncommon early period of life into public notice and e&s;teem. In danger, and while others were in di&s;may, he al|ways acted with firmne&s;s and moderation. One in&s;tance of which, may be noticed in his conduct at the banks of Mon|ongahela: There con&s;ider the youthful Wa&s;hington, in an awful time of Indian victory and triumph, collecting the re|mains of the defeated Army of Bradock.&mdash;and &s;aving, by a di&s;cernment and valor uncommon for his years, the lives of hundreds who&s;e hearts had failed for fear, and who&s;e lives were in jeopardy every moment by the unrelenting &s;avage foe.</P>
<P>DURING the period of almo&s;t Fifty Years, he was em|ployed in the performance of a &s;eries of great and important &s;ervices to his country; the &s;plendor and glory of which, eclip&s;e all the glittering royalty of all the crowns and dig|nified names, of all the Monarchs which ever &s;at upon the thrones, of all the Kingdoms and Empires of either Europe, A&s;ia, or Africa.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="037056_0011_100C3E3A49508968">RELIGION was his "con&s;tant angelic gue&s;t," and the di|vine paraclete of his heart.&mdash;During the whole of his life, he exhibited a uniform and illu&s;trious example of the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed virtues. Under his au&s;picious protection and pat|ronage, piety and righteou&s;ne&s;s, as by "kindly rains and temperate &s;uns" &s;prang up and flouri&s;hed, and have yielded a profitable harve&s;t. Like the unclouded Sun, he aro&s;e into public view; in the meredian and evening of life, attracted the attention and admiration of millions; with refulgent brightne&s;s, &s;at below the horizon of this life, in the &s;erene <HI>Eve</HI> of this exi&s;tence; and has ari&s;en, with holy &s;plendor, in the Horizon of Immortality.</P>
<P>FROM hence we learn, That, in every in&s;tance, in which we, in our re&s;pective &s;tations and employments, can imitate his virtues, it is our mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ible duty thus to do.&mdash;We all have parts to act upon the theatre of time: and ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s, and religion are nece&s;&s;ary for their right perfor|mance: Let it be our con&s;tant and greate&s;t concern to live, like the venerable WASHINGTON, godly and faithful in the pre&s;ent evil world: And when this world &s;hall recede from our mortal view, as it has from his, May we, as he did, have a religious peace in &s;uch a &s;olemn and awful period:&mdash; then we &s;hall &s;tand firm and &s;ure at the final Retribution, when the di&s;&s;olution of all terre&s;tial things and &s;cenes, &s;hall a&s;toni&s;h the thronging MULTITUDE, pre&s;&s;ing forward to the general Judgment.</P>
<P>FINALLY&mdash;My Brethren, by this in&s;tance of Mortality, we learn, the vanity of all human greatne&s;s and glory.</P>
<P>ALASS!
