<P>SAINT Paul was eminent for &s;erving the Church of Chri&s;t, not only by his doctrine, but al&s;o, by e&s;tabli&s;hing Churches in order, and appointing proper officers to take the charge and care of them; in&s;omuch that he &s;tiles him|&s;elf a &s;piritual Father; as when writing to the Corinthians, I Cor. iv. 14, 15.&mdash;"As my belo|ved &s;ons, I warn you, for though you have ten

thou&s;and in&s;tructors in Chri&s;t, yet ye have not many Fathers; for in Chri&s;t Je&s;us I have be|gotten you through the go&s;pel." But, having &s;o great a charge, it was not po&s;&s;ible for him to continue con&s;tantly at one place, neither was it for the welfare of Chri&s;t's kingdom that he &s;hould. He preached the kingdom of God, both to Jews and Gentiles, and held forth the &s;ame God, and way of &s;alvation, to both, de|caring it was one God who &s;hould ju&s;tify the circumci&s;ion by faith, and the uncircumci&s;ion through faith; and that his doctrines had no tendency to make void the law, but to e&s;tabli&s;h the law. <HI>Rom.</HI> iii.</P>
<P>PAUL is now, by our text, di&s;charging one part of his mini&s;try to the Church at <HI>Ephe&s;us;</HI> having called the Elders together, and informed them that he was about to leave them, for &s;ome weighty rea&s;ons, as he &s;ays, I go bound to <HI>Jeru|&s;alem:</HI> Before he departs, he gives to the pa&s;|tors, and doubtle&s;s to the people, &s;ome of the be&s;t advice; reminding them, what his life and doctrine had been among them; and al&s;o the many trials and temptations which had befallon him by the lying in wait of the Jews; by the unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;&s;imulation of &s;ome, who were inimical to the doctrines he delivered.</P>
<P>BUT that which was the Apo&s;tle's &s;upport, mu&s;t be that which will afford comfort to all his

followers; I mean the &s;weet approbation of con|&s;cience, that in &s;implicity and Godly &s;incerity, he had his conver&s;ation among them, di&s;charged the duty incumbent on him, to the be&s;t of his knowledge and ability, te&s;tifying daily repent|ance toward God, and faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: Thus, by his &s;incere and impartial deal|ings in the great things of Chri&s;t's kingdom, that not only God and his own con&s;cience ac|quit him, but even they them&s;elves, that is, the people among whom he had been preaching, were witne&s;&s;es, that he was pure from the blood of all men. He had &s;o plainly delivered to them the coun&s;el of God, and pre&s;&s;ed the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of go&s;pel-obedience on their con&s;ciences, that &s;hould they never &s;ee him more, in the bo|dy, at judgment they could not &s;ay, they were not &s;ufficiently warned of tho&s;e things. I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preach|ing the kingdom of God, &s;hall &s;ee my face no more: Wherefore, I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men, for i have not &s;hunned to declare to you all the coun&s;el of God. Though he had done this, he could not leave them 'till he had &s;trictly charged them to great care and watchfulne&s;s: Being fully acquainted with the &s;tate and dangers to which they were expo&s;ed, cau&s;ed him to &s;peak

with the greate&s;t confidence&mdash;" I know this, that after my departing, &s;hall grievous wolves enter in among you, not &s;paring the flock." He was &s;o fully acquainted with the temper of that people, and the many enemies which &s;urrounded them, who, by every artful &s;tratagem, entering among them, under the appearance of friends, but not having friendly intents, would be grie|vous wolves, who would not &s;pare the flock, and that they were not only expo&s;ed to wolves from without, but from the be&s;t of his know|ledge, &s;ome of their wor&s;t enemies &s;hould ari&s;e from among them&s;elves, who would gain a par|ty by &s;peaking perver&s;e things.</P>
<P>This a melancholy truth, that the wor&s;t ene|mies of Zion, will always have &s;ome followers and that &s;uch take the opportunity to work, when the Church is in the weake&s;t condition, when the watchman is off the walls. This we find has been the method in which the great ene|my of man has made in roads upon Zion, in various ages; that is, when a people were left de|&s;titute of a pa&s;tor: Notwith&s;tanding we may be &s;en&s;ible, that this will really be the ca&s;e, yet there may be rea&s;ons &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify a &s;eparation between a pa&s;tor and people: For, as two can|not walk together except they be agreed&mdash;<HI>Amos.</HI> iii. 3.&mdash;If unhappy difficulties once take place'

&s;o as to de&s;troy that love which is the band of union, that notwith&s;tanding the report may be given by the watchman, and yet the people will not take the alarm; &s;uch cannot in the lea&s;t be benefited by all his watchfulne&s;s and care; but often are more apt, by a &s;pirit of re&s;entment, to fall away with tho&s;e who would zealou&s;ly affect them, but not well.</P>
<P>As this, Sirs, is the melancholy &s;tate of this Church and people, that you are de&s;titute of a pa&s;tor's care, the grounds of our &s;eparation being &s;o well known, it would be untimely to mention them at pre&s;ent; permit me to &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle, though I pretend not with that degree of a&s;&s;urance&mdash;" that I know this, that after my departing, &s;hall grievous wolves enter in among you, not &s;paring the flock." As the Apo&s;tle had a knowledge that this had been the ca&s;e in many in&s;tances, and from the &s;tate and temper of the Church at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> he was per|&s;uaded this would be the ca&s;e with them: I have no other way to account for my fears, on this affair, but by the like way of argument, that the like difficulties, which I pray a compa&s;&s;i|nate God to avert&mdash;will attend you in your pre&s;ent broken &s;tate.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> THAT they are expo&s;ed to grievous wolves.</P>
<P>FROM the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion, Zi|on has ever had her enemies; the great adver|&s;ary, like a roaring lion, goes about &s;eeking whom he may de&s;troy: He ranged paradi&s;e, having leaped the peaceful walls, till he finds his prey; and man, poor innocent man, be|comes a victim to his rage and malice, but thanks be to Heaven, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, engages for man, appears as his Deliver|er, and re&s;cues him from the power of the infernal prince: And, notwith&s;tanding, by the atone|ment of the Son of God, the Church is redeem|ed from her enemies; and, by virtue of his en|gagements
<PB N="11" REF="046360_0009_1021419E08A739A8">
with the Father, the Father has en|gaged to rai&s;e up a Church, and that the gates of hell &s;hall not finally prevail again&s;t it; yet the adver&s;ary is not &s;o clo&s;ely confined, but that the Church is &s;ubject to receive from his &s;pite grievous wounds, which may all be con&s;i&s;tent with that divine &s;entence again&s;t the &s;erpent,<HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 15&mdash;I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy &s;eed and her &s;eed: It &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel. The&s;e brui&s;es on the heel, the Church has in all ages received. For wi&s;e ends &s;atan is permitted to range at certain limits, and though he may, by guile, bring mortals into the mo&s;t deplorable circum&s;tances, yet, as he had no power to compel the fir&s;t happy pair to &s;in, neither has he now: Hence &s;ays <HI>St. John</HI> 1. iv.4,&mdash;Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. Thus he is &s;tyled the tempter&mdash;1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> iii. 5.&mdash;becau&s;e his warfare is carried on by guile and &s;tratagem; knowing that by open violence and force of arms, he never can great|ly &s;trengthen his party, or weaken the Church of Chri&s;t. Our &s;piritual enemies are ever on their watch, and are never more careful, than when men are carele&s;s, and off their guard&mdash;<HI>Mat.</HI> xiii. 25&mdash;while men &s;lept, his enemy came and &s;owed tares, and the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e|holder came, and &s;aid unto him, Sir, did&s;t not
<PB N="12" REF="046360_0010_102141A29D168880">
thou &s;ow good &s;eed in thy field? From whence then hath it tares? And he &s;aid to them, an ene|my hath done this. This parable is opened by our Savious, wherein the tares are &s;aid to be the children of the wicked one, who were influen|ced to all impiety, and to injure the wheat, that is, God's children, and that the&s;e were &s;ent forth by their father, the prince of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN the watchmen of Zion &s;tand on the walls attentive to the approach of the enemy, and the people attentively waiting for their a|larm, they are then not only in the way, in which they may expect the &s;pecial aids of Hea|ven, but are more fitly prepared by union of force, to with&s;tand the fiery a&s;&s;aults, and fight, with the whole armour of God: But when, ei|ther the people grow inattentive to the call, or the watchman is removed from the tower, &s;atan in&s;tantly &s;eizes the opportunity, and marches in the &s;wiftne&s;s of his might, with all his attend|ants, to wa&s;te and de&s;troy: His watchfulne&s;s to evil, we may &s;ee de&s;cribed <HI>Rev.</HI> xii.&mdash;where he is repre&s;ented as the red dragon, &s;tanding before the woman, ready to be delivered of the man|child, to devour the child as &s;oon as it was born. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is only ab&s;ent for a &s;hort time, being on the mount with God, and the adver&s;ary &s;eizes
<PB N="13" REF="046360_0011_102141A422753290">
that opportunity, to urge the people on to idol|atry; that the Lord &s;ays to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> "Go get thee down, for thy people which thou broughte&s;t up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted them|&s;elves, they have turned a&s;ide quickly out of the way&mdash;<HI>Exod.</HI> xxxii.</P>
<P>IN like manner, when <HI>I&s;rael</HI> is repre&s;ented as being in a broken &s;tate, and guilty of high im|moralities, this rea&s;on is given, as in <HI>Judges</HI> xvii. 6.&mdash;In tho&s;e days there was no king in <HI>I&s;|rael,</HI> and every man did that which was right in his own eyes&mdash;they were de&s;titute of any head and leader; and while this was the ca&s;e the re|ligious in&s;titutions were mo&s;tly thrown a&s;ide; various irregular modes and cu&s;toms of wor|&s;hip took place, as each one fancied: This, doubtle&s;s, made Micah &s;o gladly receive the Le|vite of <HI>Beth-lebem-judab,</HI> and &s;ay to him, dwell with me, and be to me a father, and a prie&s;t&mdash;<HI>Judges</HI> xvii.</P>
<P>BUT further, we find that not only &s;atan him. &s;elf has been influencing the hearts of men to fall away from their profe&s;&s;ion: But even of our&s;elves have men ari&s;en &s;peaking perver&s;e things, to draw away di&s;ciples after them; that fal&s;e Chri&s;ts and fal&s;e prophets have ari&s;en, to do his &s;ervice. For as there were fal&s;e prophets under the old te&s;tament, who laboured again&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="046360_0012_102141A67AB1FC58">
the prophets of God; &s;o, &s;ays he Divine Savi|our, <HI>Mat.</HI> xxiv. 24.&mdash;There &s;hall ari&s;e fal&s;e Chri&s;ts, and behold, I have told you before.&mdash;So he tells us, <HI>Mat.</HI> vii. 15.&mdash;They will come in &s;heep's cloathing, but inwardly be ravening wolves, but ye &s;hall know them by their fruits. This was the voice, not only of the Lord him|&s;elf, but of his di&s;ciples al&s;o&mdash;2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii.&mdash;In the la&s;t days, perilous times &s;hall come; men &s;hall come forth, having a form of godline&s;s, but denying the power, who will creep into hou|&s;es, and lead captive &s;illy women, laden with di|vers lu&s;ts, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</P>
<P>SUCH as the&s;e are actually now in the world, and in what danger do people &s;tand of being &s;e|duced by them, when brought into a broken &s;tate; &s;uch are the &s;ocieties they will frequent, and this is the time they will work; by an ex|traordinary appearance of godline&s;s &s;teel the affections, creep into the heart, and &s;o lead away the &s;imple, and the unguarded. Divi&s;ions are the loude&s;t calls for the&s;e wolves to come and &s;eize the prey; the horrid cries of contention is mu&s;ic to their ears; and when the members are at variance, they will more readily gain the af|fections of &s;ome, by e&s;pou&s;ing their cau&s;e:&mdash;Hence &s;aid <HI>Saint Paul, Gal. iv.</HI> 17.&mdash;They zea|lou&s;ly
<PB N="15" REF="046360_0013_102141A81D585C10">
affect you, but not well; who would de|pend on the fond appearance of a wolf? No more dependance is to be put on tho&s;e who en|ter into the fold of Chri&s;t, but not by the door, they &s;ow the &s;eeds of all &s;edition among a peo|ple.</P>
<P>'Tis too much the unhappy ca&s;e, that, when a &s;ociety gets thus divided, every one as it were, appears to have &s;ome particular notions of their own; and they will have no one for their mi|ni&s;ter, unle&s;s he is in every thing of their mind, even if all the re&s;t are agreed in him: The &s;pirit of divi&s;ion is often a &s;pirit of re&s;ent|ment, and to an&s;wer &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h view; &s;ome pay|ing no regard to the general good and peace, pay not the lea&s;t attention to purity of doctrine, or conformity of manners, but open the door with their own hands, to introduce the wolf among their tender lambs.</P>
<P>THIS has an immediate tendency to &s;et up parties and when &s;trength is divided, the larg|e&s;t body becomes weak; and the &s;ociety which, while united, might have &s;tood in defence of pure religion, now becomes a receptacle of all religions, &s;ects, parties and incon&s;i&s;tencies, yea, a &s;ource of all confu&s;ion and impiety; and what &s;port is this, my dear Sirs, to the enemy of all good!</P>

God's hou&s;e is for&s;aken&mdash;his Sabbaths are forgotten&mdash;his precepts are pre&s;ently unknown, and all ho|ly exerci&s;e becomes a burden&mdash;and thus to di|vi&s;ion will be coupled the mo&s;t fatal ignorance, which is ever an inlet to all error: Men, who are the lea&s;t qualified to be judges of doctrine, will ari&s;e up, and be teachers, as the text &s;ays, "&s;peaking perver&s;e things;" he will have his di&s;ciples, inculcate things they under&s;tand not them&s;elves, and &s;o will ignorantly be &s;cattering poi&s;on on the table before their tender offspring: It behoves every &s;cribe in the kingdom of God, to be well in&s;tructed, who can bring from his trea&s;ure things new and old&mdash;<HI>Mat.</HI> xiii. 15.</P>
