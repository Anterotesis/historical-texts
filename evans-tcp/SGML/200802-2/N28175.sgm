<P>Know ye not that there is a prince, and a great man, fal|len this day in I&s;rael?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHILE I behold this a&s;&s;embly, admiring the &s;olemnity that appears in every countenance, and reflect on the melancholy occa&s;ion of our meeting, I feel emotions in my heart impo&s;&s;ible for my tongue to de&s;cribe. While I am led to regret the great and irreco|verable lo&s;s my country has &s;u&s;tained by the death of her Deliverer, I feel a mea&s;ure of joy ari&s;ing from the reflec|tion, that he died not unlamented. No&mdash;you, my brethren, have this day evidenced your re&s;pect to his memory; and by the great concour&s;e who are now crowded within the&s;e walls you manife&s;t your &s;orrow as chri&s;tians, Americans, and lovers of liberty. Your countenances be&s;peak that &s;uitable degree of grief that now occupies your hearts, and &s;hew that you partici|pate with your fellow citizens throughout the&s;e United States in the general affliction occa&s;ioned by the lo&s;s of our beloved WASHINGTON. While we drop the &s;ympathizing tear over his princely urn, with all our afflicted brethren, let us not, my countrymen, be guilty of the &s;uper&s;titious errors prevalent in pagan ages and countries: Let us carefully avoid every ap|pearance of &s;ervility and adulation, which are a re|proach to republicans, and would be &s;candalous in the virtuous and enlightened &s;ons of Columbia. Let us,
<PB N="4" REF="037558_0004_100EDB621C650EE8">
while we are paying the ju&s;t tribute of re&s;pect due to his exalted merit, aim at the medium between the ex|tremes of indifference and va&s;&s;alage.</P>
<P>In the words of the text, David calls Abner a great man&mdash;WASHINGTON was much greater; and, if we except tho&s;e who in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> extraordinary manner were in&s;pired to reveal the will and mind of God to mortals, I &s;incerely believe a greater than WASHINGTON never exi&s;ted. Many great and virtuous men, in various ages, and among different nations of the world, have &s;hined like the moon in their re&s;pective orbits; but when compared to the illu&s;trious WASHINGTON, who may with propriety be called the re&s;plendent Sun of Ameri|ca, who&s;e virtues and abilities poured forth the genial rays, and di&s;&s;eminated the light and vigour, of liberty in the hearts of Columbia's &s;ons&mdash;their glory and ex|cellence is &s;wallowed up in the bright effulgence that proceeds from our mo&s;t excellent Chief. Tho&s;e who are inclined to extol them who have been remarkable for great abilities, or eminent for worthy actions, re|pre&s;enting any one of them as the perfection of human nature, and in&s;inuating that none more remarkable, emi|nent or virtuous ever lived&mdash;let them not li&s;p the name of WASHINGTON, le&s;t the glory of their particu|lar favourites be eclip&s;ed, as the light of the moon is by the brightne&s;s of the &s;un. The glory of Columbia has never been equalled, not to &s;ay excelled, in tho&s;e orna|ments of mankind.</P>
<P>I have never &s;uppo&s;ed greatne&s;s to con&s;i&s;t in noble birth, the virtues of ance&s;tors, or in the worthy deeds of our fathers. Even in this re&s;pect, none, even the mo&s;t ignorant, can a&s;per&s;e our beloved WASHINGTON. Dr. Robin&s;on &s;ays, he was a de&s;cendant from the great duke of Albermarle, who was the in&s;trument in God's hand of re&s;toring peace and tranquillity in England, and out of anarchy and confu&s;ion to introduce a regu|lar form of government, any kind of which is better than none. But his greatne&s;s proceeds from his own innate virtues and abilities: this will appear more
<PB N="5" REF="037558_0005_100EDB63AAA2DF08">
con&s;picuous, if we compare him with, and contra&s;t him to, many who were and now are called great in the world.</P>
<P N="1">1. He was greater than ALEXANDER.&mdash;Becau&s;e, de&s;titute of the guilty ambition that fired the brea&s;t of that hair-brained Grecian youth, when he appeared in the field under the command of Braddock, we have every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e (if we judge by his future con|duct) that a fervent de&s;ire to &s;ave his countrymen from the cruel hands of the &s;avage barbarians induced him to leave the plea&s;ures of a rural, to endure the fatigues, toils and dangers of a &s;oldier's life. At the commence|ment of the American war, his country called, and he obeyed. Again the plea&s;ures of Vernon are de&s;erted: he draws his &s;word in the cau&s;e of liberty, not to de|&s;troy or en&s;lave nations, but to pre&s;erve them; not to make him&s;elf popular by &s;hedding the blood of thou|&s;ands, but to make Columbia free and happy. Every part of his conduct, in the field, in our councils, and in the cabinet, evidences, his only ambition was, faithfully to &s;erve his country, and take an active part in the cau&s;e of liberty.</P>
<P N="2">2. He was greater than VESPASIAN.&mdash;His vir|tues were not blotted by an in&s;atiate love for gold. His noble brea&s;t never lu&s;ted after &s;uch paltry &s;tuff. It was not poverty that drove him from his peaceful abode; neither was he under the nece&s;&s;ity of entering the field to &s;upport a broken fortune, or to accumu|late wealth. No, my countrymen; when he entered the field, and drew his &s;word for us, he was ble&s;&s;ed with every nece&s;&s;ary that could make life happy. His refu&s;ing any compen&s;ation for his &s;ervices evidently proves, he was not infected with this pernicious vice: he had enough: an addition would have been profu&s;ion; and profu&s;ion and luxury this virtuous republican de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="3">3. He was greater than JULIUS CAESAR.&mdash;Al|though this Roman chief was eminent for great abili|ties,
<PB N="6" REF="037558_0006_100EDB656EFB38C0">
and particular virtues, we find his reputation &s;potted with pride and ba&s;e pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>Was WASHINGTON guilty of the&s;e vices? Were the Commander of the American army, and the Se|nate of Columbia, in oppo&s;ition to each other? Did the General refu&s;e to obey the orders of the Congre&s;s? Was he de&s;irous to aggrandize him&s;elf, rather than promote the cau&s;e of liberty by laudable and virtuous means? No; tho&s;e imperfections never polluted the virtuous heart of WASHINGTON. Always &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive and conde&s;cending, he acted in concert with the Congre&s;s, and adopted their mea&s;ures. It is true, in his letters he mentioned what he thought nece&s;&s;ary to be done, but in language &s;o mode&s;t and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, they &s;carcely had the appearance of advice, much le&s;s the air of dictation. By his mode&s;ty, and their conde|&s;cen&s;ion, true friend&s;hip&punc; and lenity &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them. So far was he from acting the part of Cae&s;ar, that I firmly believe he would have entered the ranks, and &s;erved as a private &s;oldier, if his &s;ervices in that &s;ta|tion would have promoted the cau&s;e of Columbia more than his commanding the army. It was not to make famous the name of WASHINGTON, that indu|ced him to un&s;heath his &s;word&mdash;it was to make America free and happy.</P>
<P N="4">4. He was greater than CHARLES.&mdash;This Swe|di&s;h monarch by his ra&s;hne&s;s and intemperance had a brave army de&s;troyed, in the mid&s;t of Ru&s;&s;ia, by Pe|ter: in all his tran&s;actions we di&s;cover more courage than conduct. WASHINGTON was deliberate in all his mea&s;ures, and executed them with prudence and calmne&s;s: the lives of his &s;oldiers were not &s;acrificed to his enemies becau&s;e he would not recede from mea&s;ures he had adopted, when he was fully convin|ced they were erroneous, and would be attended with fatal con&s;equences: willing rather to &s;hew that he was man, than to ri&s;k the lo&s;s of his army without any probability of &s;ucce&s;s, he thought it no di&s;parage|ment to expo&s;e his fallibility, and &s;hew the world
<PB N="7" REF="037558_0007_100EDB67653669B8">
that he was not ob&s;tinate in errors: he well knew that in the multitude of coun&s;ellors there is &s;afety; and therefore did not, like Charles, keep his officers ignorant of his de&s;igns.</P>
<P N="5">5. He was greater than PHILIP and PETER.&mdash; The&s;e great men injured their reputation by the acts of cruelty and barbarity they &s;o often committed, which &s;hock the feelings of humanity to relate or hear.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was a &s;tranger to this ferocious &s;pirit; he knew nothing of this bea&s;tly di&s;po&s;ition; his &s;oul did not delight in the afflictions and &s;ufferings of his fellow creatures; it was not made and form'd of &s;tuff &s;o &s;tern. Did he ever &s;mile when he heard the &s;oldier &s;igh, or &s;aw him weep? Did he &s;tand unaffected when he &s;aw him bleed, or beheld his wounds? Did he not commi&s;erate his hard fate, when de&s;titute of the nece&s;&s;aries of life? Did he ever hear the mourning of the &s;oldier's widow, and the cries of his orphan children, without &s;ympathizing with them, and alleviating their &s;orrow if in his power?&mdash; The truly brave are humane, and are not in&s;en&s;ible when they &s;ee the tears, or hear the complaints, of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. See our WASHINGTON in Braddock's &s;laughtered army&mdash;What tears and entreaties he made u&s;e of to &s;ave his countrymen, while his heart experienced the keene&s;t pain to &s;ee the dreadful carnage!</P>
<P>His benevolent heart was not of a contracted na|ture: it embraced the foe, even the enemy of liberty and his country; thinking it more noble to treat him with lenity and compa&s;&s;ion, than to augment his mi&s;eries, and increa&s;e his &s;ufferings. Let tho&s;e who were pri&s;oners in the late war te&s;tify of his conduct in this re&s;pect. The Briti&s;h have not withheld that tribute of prai&s;e due to the virtue of Columbia's Chief. Behold his conduct at the melancholy affair of the unfortunate and much-lamented Andre.</P>
<P N="6">6. He was greater than TRAJAN.&mdash;&mdash;The worthy deeds of this noble hero were tarni&s;hed by li&s;tening to
<PB N="8" REF="037558_0008_100EDB69216CBF58">
the tongue of &s;lander, which filled him with the &s;pirit of jealou&s;y, that green-eyed mon&s;ter; the con&s;equen|ces of which deprived many thou&s;ands of their lives, who were his friends, and delighted in his pro&s;perity. Our Illu&s;trious Chief well under&s;tood men, and, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing a good and virtuous &s;oul, which was aver&s;e to vice, he would willingly have thought all men virtu|ous, as he was virtuous. As a vicious mind is al|ways &s;u&s;picious, &s;o a virtuous one thinks no evil. WASHINGTON knew bad men exi&s;ted; but he was willing to think every man good until he proved him to be bad: when proved, and found to be &s;uch, he would rather reform than de&s;troy. His ear was never plea&s;ed with the voice of &s;lander; and if he was un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of hearing accu&s;ations, he was willing to make great allowances for prejudice and party &s;pirit: his judgment was never formed until he had heard the defence of the accu&s;ed, as well as the ac|cu&s;ation. He could well bear a &s;uperior: this gives him the pre-eminence of Cae&s;ar. He could well bear an equal: this makes him greater than the jealous Pompey. His hone&s;t heart never envied another for his merit. See his conduct when an attempt was made to &s;upplant him in office. Did he treat one of his generals as Pompey treated Cae&s;ar, although he knew the machinations that were carried on again&s;t him? No; the jealou&s;y of vicious minds had no effect on him: he trod in the paths of virtue, and al|ways delighted in merit, and was not the la&s;t to pay due re&s;pect to the abilities of another, when it was apparently to his own injury.</P>
<P N="7">7. He was greater than CORIOLANUS.&mdash;When this Roman hero received an in&s;ult, he de&s;erted the cau&s;e of his country, and joined with the enemy, to the injury of Rome. He deprives her of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he was able to afford, and proceeded to take up arms again&s;t her, with an intention to revenge his private in|juries on all his countrymen; as though he was more anxious to &s;upport his own than his country's glory.
<PB N="9" REF="037558_0009_100EDB6B2272E8A0">
Was this a nobl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; No; it remains as a blot on his memory, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gratitude of his countrymen to|ward him as an individ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al will ju&s;tify his proceedings.</P>
<P>Would WASHINGT<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">N thus have acted? No; I &s;in|cerely believe he would have &s;uffered his heart to be opened, and every drop of blood to be drained from it, rather than have taken up arms again&s;t his country, or even de&s;erted the cau&s;e of Columbia. He was not a &s;tranger to in&s;ults; he met with reflections, and was treated in a di&s;re&s;pectful manner by men in high repute, and of exalted rank; but he &s;miled at their envy, &s;corned their malice, and pitied their jealou&s;y. The cau&s;e of liberty was his cau&s;e, and faithfully he fought by her &s;tandard. He did not, like the ba&s;e Arnold, (with abhorrence I mention his name) revenge a pri|vate affront by a&s;&s;i&s;ting the enemy, and wa&s;hing his hands in the blood of his countrymen, or di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the lovers of liberty.</P>
<P N="8">8. He was greater than CROMWELL.&mdash;Crom|well deceived the Engli&s;h. He apparently drew his &s;word to redre&s;s their grievances: they courageou&s;ly fought by his &s;ide, and, animated by his bravery, &s;ub|dued their enemies. But behold, for yokes of wood he made them wear tho&s;e of iron, and whips they exchan|ged for &s;corpions. Whatever his pretences were be|fore or in the war&mdash;however he might profe&s;s his love for the commonwealth, and proclaim him&s;elf a republi|can&mdash;yet, when he &s;aw the enemy vanqui&s;hed, he a|vailed him&s;elf of the opportunity that offered, a&s;&s;umed the title of Lord Protector, and ruled with more &s;eve|rity and de&s;poti&s;m than the unfortunate Charles. After thou&s;ands were &s;acrificed, he made the &s;ituation of England wor&s;e than it was under its former govern|ment. His crime was aggravated by the ba&s;e hypo|cri&s;y he u&s;ed to effect his de&s;igns.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="037558_0010_100EDB6CFAB27188">Did WASHINGTON thus deceive the brave &s;ons of Columbia? Did he thus w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de through oceans of blood to make him&s;elf great, and pro&s;titute the name of li|berty and religion to effect ambitious de&s;igns? No, my countrymen; he willingly re&s;igned his &s;word unto tho&s;e who put it into his hands, and &s;hewed the world that America was not deceived by or in him. So far was he from &s;tirring up a civil war to make him|&s;elf ab&s;olute, that he &s;tepped forward when the army were inclined to be mutinous, and u&s;ed his influence to reconcile them, when perhaps he was the only man in America that could &s;o effectually re&s;tore peace. What an opportunity was here offered to act the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Crom|well! But his virtuous brea&s;t abhorred the deed; he lu&s;ted not for ba&s;e-begotten power; he returned from the fields of battle crowned with the laurels of victory, meeting with the prai&s;e and acclamations of his coun|trymen, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that degree of popularity his noble mind a&s;pired after, viz. the love of Columbia's &s;ons in the cau&s;e of virtue.</P>
<P>The men I have mentioned received the appellation of great, and are to this day repre&s;ented as characters worthy of imitation to the ri&s;ing po&s;terity. It appears to me almo&s;t a di&s;paragement to the character of our beloved WASHINGTON to compare him with many of them. As they were eminent for valiant actions, they are al&s;o remarkable for abominable vices: the&s;e vices he abhorred. They had imperfections that never &s;ullied his character. Will not every lover of liberty ju&s;tify me when I &s;ay, that he was not only a GREAT MAN, but, excepting, as I have &s;aid before, the &s;ubjects of extraor|dinary in&s;piration, the GREATEST OF MEN? His negative virtues are worthy of our ob&s;ervation; but we are not confined to them: he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed virtues &s;ufficient to dazzle the eye of every unprejudiced and candid
<PB N="11" REF="037558_0011_100EDB6F224D47D0">
beholder&mdash;Of every unprejudiced beholder did I &s;ay?&mdash; Every man, who has the exerci&s;e of his rea&s;on, mu&s;t and will, with ineffable plea&s;ure, behold the character of Columbia's Glory; who was great without guilty am|bition, honourable without o&s;tentation, courageous without ra&s;hne&s;s, prudent without timidity, wi&s;e with|out pre&s;umption, patriotic without &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, humble without guile, and pious without &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P N="1">1. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the moderation of CINCINNA|TUS.&mdash;Like this Roman chief he was called from the plea&s;ures of a rural life, when the American revo|lution took place, to command an army compo&s;ed of Columbia's brave &s;ons, who groaned under their bur|dens, and longed to be free. At this critical period the eye of all America was on WASHINGTON, as the only man with whom they could entru&s;t this im|portant office. With what moderation and &s;elf-diffi|dence did he accept the offer! With what zeal did he labour to effect the arduous ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned him! When he had &s;ubdued the enemies of Columbia, Cincinnatus-like he humbly re&s;igns his commi&s;&s;ion to, and lays it at the feet of, the &s;upreme rulers; then he retires to his beloved retreat on Vernon's mount. Not long did he continue in the enjoyment which he there had promi&s;ed him&s;elf. Again his country calls, and he obeys. He accepts the office of Supreme Magi&s;trate, with his former mode&s;ty; and faithfully he di&s;charged the duties of it; until, far advanced in years, he declines occupying his former re&s;pectable office, and withdraws to &s;pend the remainder of his days in retirement and peace. The ancient Father of America hears that his country's rights are violated by a foreign power, and again the &s;ons of Columbia, who were not ignorant of his abilities, look up to him for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Though far advanced in years, and almo&s;t worn out in his country's &s;ervice,
<PB N="12" REF="037558_0012_100EDB70EEDC5680">
he yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ures them that when nece&s;&s;ary he will again command their armies. Like Cincinnatus, he loved his countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to his late&s;t hour.</P>
<P N="2">2. He had the con&s;tancy of CAMILLUS.&mdash;Al|though he was treated ami&s;s by many, and even ex|po&s;ed to dangers, hard&s;hips, toils and troubles, his con|&s;tant heart, ever true to the cau&s;e of liberty, never &s;uf|fered him to con&s;ult his own ea&s;e when his country was in danger. You, my countrymen, in the late war fre|quently trembled on his account. You &s;carcely knew whether he was dead or living; before you were aware of it, behold, he was in a part of the continent that little expected him, and at the very heels of his enemies. Like Camillus before the walls of Rome, &s;o he appeared before Trenton and York, to the great con|fu&s;ion of his enemies.</P>
<P>In his gloomy rout through the Jer&s;eys he was troubled on every &s;ide, yet not di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; perplexed, but not in de&s;pair; per&s;ecuted, but not for&s;aken; ca&s;t down, but not de&s;troyed. Although his enemies re|joiced in his forlorn &s;ituation, and entertained plea&s;ing hopes of his final ruin, behold, he appears &s;uddenly, routs and di&s;per&s;es them. As Camillus drove the Gauls from the walls of Rome, and compelled them to return to their own country, &s;o WASHINGTON drove the ho&s;|tile Engli&s;h from the &s;hores of America, and forced them to return to Britain with &s;hame and confu&s;ion. He re|vived the drooping hearts of Columbia's &s;ons by the ble&s;&s;ing of liberty.</P>
<P N="3">3. He had the fortitude of TITUS.&mdash;Although his army was frequently routed, and he with pain be|held his brave troops bleeding, and flying in every di|rection before a powerful and victorious enemy&mdash;al|though other armies in different parts of the United States, who were engaged in the cau&s;e of liberty, &s;hared
<PB N="13" REF="037558_0013_100EDB72AFF4B3F0">
the &s;ame fate, and to all human appearance the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of Columbia mu&s;t fall before the power of Britain, and bow to the cruel invader&mdash;although many of the offi|cers in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ea&s;on lo&s;t all their hopes, while the private &s;oldiers were almo&s;t &s;unk into de&s;pair&mdash;the &s;ons of America, and the daughters of Columbia, wept, and &s;mote their brea&s;ts for grief, while their eyes were fixed on and looking up to him, by whom they ex|pected deliverance&mdash;he alone remains calm and &s;erene in this awful juncture, and like Titus renews the attack again, and again, until he &s;hews him&s;elf victorious. I make no doubt that our Hero was affected when he viewed the deplorable &s;tate of his affairs; but the ju&s;t cau&s;e in which he was engaged, and the confidence he had in that righteous God who &s;uperintends all hu|man events, &s;upported his mind, and gave him that de|gree of fortitude by which he was enabled to face the enemy, and manfully fight for liberty and his country.</P>
<P N="4">4. He had the wi&s;dom and hone&s;ty of FABI|US.&mdash;Courage in war, without prudence, would lead a man into many difficulties, from which he could not ea&s;ily extricate him&s;elf. Should I attempt to enumerate the many circum&s;tances, that occurred through the cour&s;e of the late war, in which the &s;uperior wi&s;dom of WASHINGTON was di&s;played, it would exhau&s;t my &s;trength. As they were many, &s;o they are recent. His de&s;igns were not planned precipitately, but with proper deliberation: when a|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pted, they were receded from if found to be errone|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, but if approved of, on the day and at the place of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">on they were executed with judgment and regu|larity. He well knew what advantages to avail him&s;elf of, and what u&s;e to make of them&mdash;when to appear again&s;t the enemy, and when to avoid them&mdash;in what to encounter them, and at what time&mdash;when to pur&s;ue
<PB N="14" REF="037558_0014_100EDB74AA098D08">
them, and when to retreat before them&mdash;when to &s;lacken the reins of di&s;cipline in his army, and when &s;trictly to enforce it&mdash;when to appear affable, and when re&s;erved&mdash;when to encourage, and when to threaten. I know of few to whom our beloved WASHINGTON can be compared in this re&s;pect, and to none with more propriety than to FABIUS: in every trait of his character he equals if not excels him. His hone&s;ty was as remarkable as his wi&s;dom. When reduced to the mo&s;t humiliating &s;ituation he could po&s;&s;ibly be in (unle&s;s a pri&s;oner in his enemies' hands) when he needed men, money, and the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life, his enemies offered him certain honours, and great rewards, if he would de&s;ert the cau&s;e of liberty. On this occa&s;ion he &s;hewed that &s;ame &s;pirit of indignation that fired the brea&s;t of the holy martyr when the queen's pardon was offered him on ba&s;e conditions: he exclaimed "God forbid I &s;hould touch the unclean thing."</P>
<P>WASHINGTON, as before ob&s;erved, did not engage in the war to accumulate wealth: if he had, this was a fair opportunity to acquire it. Neither did he labour to gain honour, but by virtuous deeds. The &s;ituation of his affairs, when the bribe was offered, were &s;uch that few men would have refu&s;ed it. As to fortune, he had much to lo&s;e with the lo&s;s of liberty, and no property did he gain by making America free. If he de&s;ired honours from Columbia's &s;ons, the pro&s;|pect was dark and gloomy, and no certain foundation had he to build his hopes upon: whereas, had he accepted the bribe, he would have obtained certain though ba&s;e honours. But he would rather ri&s;k the chance of being conquered, &s;afely conveyed to the Tower of London, and executed as a rebel, than to for&s;ake the cau&s;e of liberty, and betray the tru&s;t com|mitted
<PB N="15" REF="037558_0015_100EDB767675DD30">
to him by the virtuous Americans. He was one of tho&s;e "hone&s;t men," who are "the noble&s;t work of God."</P>
<P>"O admirable WASHINGTON! it was as impo&s;&s;i|ble to "prevent the &s;un from &s;hining, as to di|vert thee from the paths of virtue." Thy enemies were not perfectly acquainted with thee, or they would never have made the fruitle&s;s and vain attempt to allure thee by gold and honours, or terrify thee with threatenings, menaces and invectives, as means to in|duce or compel thee to betray thy country, and blot thy reputation with vice. Ye &s;ons of Columbia, your Chief has taught the world to believe, a man did exi&s;t, whom no quantity of gold, nor profu&s;ion of honours, could pollute. He had no price but virtue, no object but liberty. The offers of one day, and the threaten|ings of another, had the &s;ame effect on him, who&s;e only policy was hone&s;ty, and who&s;e only glory was virtue.</P>
<P N="5">5. He had the re&s;olution of FREDERIC.&mdash;&mdash;Cou|rage and prudence are not always united in military characters. It would be often better to be quite de&s;ti|tute of both, than to po&s;&s;e&s;s one in a very great, and the other in a very &s;mall, degree. Courage often be|comes the &s;ource of mi&s;ery to him who is de&s;titute of prudence. In WASHINGTON we find both united: not intimidated by the &s;ight of danger, when there was a probability of &s;ucce&s;s he ru&s;hed forward with cou|rage, well tempered by good conduct. Fear never pre|vented him from &s;eizing an advantage: he never eva|ded, when he might &s;afely come to, an engagement. No; he drew his &s;word to protect Columbia, and valiantly faced every oppo&s;ition; not accounting his life dear to him, if he could only make America the &s;eat of peace and liberty. The purity of his cau&s;e, and the &s;trict virtue he practi&s;ed, deprived death of his ter|rors;
<PB N="16" REF="037558_0016_100EDB78483C0C28">
his &s;oul was thereby pre&s;erved, and in the field of battle with perfect calmne&s;s he i&s;&s;ued out orders.</P>
<P>Such was our WASHINGTON (not inferior to Fre|deric) who was a mighty man of war. But this was not his delight; it was his duty. For us, my country|men, he un&s;heathed the &s;word, and cha&s;ti&s;ed the pre|&s;umptuous &s;ons of Britain: and, &s;trange to tell, as they once feared, &s;o now they love, the name of WASHING|TON.</P>
<P>Thus, my countrymen, you behold, and while you behold you admire, the greatne&s;s of your Illu&s;trious Chief. He was not only great, but great among the greate&s;t; de&s;titute of their vices, yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their abilities. He had not the ambition of Alexander, the avarice of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, the pre&s;umption of Cae&s;ar, the ra&s;hne&s;s of Charles, the cruelty of Philip and Peter, the credulity of Trajan, the jealou&s;y of Pompey, the weak|ne&s;s of Coriolanus, or the hypocri&s;y of Cromwell; but the moderation of Cincinnatus, the con&s;tancy of Ca|millus, the fortitude of Titus, the courage of Frederic, the wi&s;dom and hone&s;ty of Fabius. Many of the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed virtues, and are called great; their names are not blotted with vice; yet they are inferior to WASHINGTON: they did not po&s;&s;e&s;s virtues of &s;o ma|ny kinds, nor in &s;o great a degree: they had no virtues that he was de&s;titute of, no u&s;eful abilities but what he was acquainted with. But who of them ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or when and where did the man ever exi&s;t who po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed, all the abilities of WASHINGTON, and all the vir|tues that ornamented his &s;oul? To the fiercene&s;s of Alexander, he united the moderation of Cincinnatus; the courage of Frederic, with the wi&s;dom of Fabius; the fidelity of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, with the patrioti&s;m of Camil|lus; the &s;pirit of Cae&s;ar, with the fortitude of Titus.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="037558_0017_100EDB7A025CDBC0">I &s;hall now mention his greatne&s;s as a <HI>ruler.</HI> By the unanimous voice of the citizens of the United States, he was called to the high and important office of Pre&s;i|dent. In this re&s;pectable po&s;t, he did not carry him|&s;elf as a man with proud looks, and of an high mind: his moderation was known to all men; none complain|ed of his power, or envied him his glory. His abilities and virtues were augmented with his cares. His de|&s;ire for the welfare of the Indian tribes; his love for peace at home and abroad; his manner in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing internal in&s;urrections, and baffling foreign artifices; every part of his admini&s;tration, be&s;poke the greatne&s;s of his &s;oul, and the wi&s;dom that re&s;ted on him. To mention every part of his conduct, while he filled this important office, would be very improper on this occa|&s;ion. We this day enjoy the ble&s;&s;ed effects of his wi&s;e proceedings. Happy wa&s;t thou, O Columbia! Who was like unto thee, O people favoured of the Lord&mdash; ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a righteous ruler, who cau&s;ed the land to rejoice, and exalted our nation?</P>
<P>I will now con&s;ider his greatne&s;s as a <HI>political writer.</HI> In his writings you view him great with his pen, as he formerly was with his &s;word. In all his letters and ad|dre&s;&s;es he evidences him&s;elf to be no un&s;kilful work|man; particularly in his la&s;t Legacy. It was &s;aid, Ari&s;totle &s;hewed him&s;elf to be great by his writings. The writings of WASHINGTON were not inferior to his: in them he di&s;plays his republican principles, and &s;hews him&s;elf to be the real friend of liberty. With what zeal he recommends union to the people of the United States, reprobates military e&s;tabli&s;hments, and recommends u&s;eful knowledge! In fine, he gave advice which, if adopted, would make Columbia the &s;eat of li|berty and peace. In this Addre&s;s are &s;entiments &s;o &s;u|blime, they do honour to his memory, and &s;hould be taught the ri&s;ing po&s;terity. While he wrote the&s;e pre|cious
<PB N="18" REF="037558_0018_100EDB7BC45F2FB8">
lines, and retired from public &s;ervice, like the Jewi&s;h prophet on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, I fancy him u&s;ing his language&mdash;God forbid that I &s;hould &s;in again&s;t the Lord in cea&s;ing to pray for you. O Columbia! his God only knows how often he bowed his knee, and lifted his hand, toward the throne of Grace in your be|half. He fir&s;t &s;erved you with his &s;word; when it was returned to its &s;cabbard, he pre&s;ided in your councils, and &s;erved you in the cabinet as faithfully as he had done in the field; then with his pen he laboured for your welfare; and la&s;t of all, with fervent &s;uppli|cations to his God. I make no doubt but you agree with me, that WASHINGTON was not only greater than Abner, but greater than any unin&s;pired man you ever heard or read of.</P>
<P>But he is fallen. WASHINGTON is no more: the union between his &s;oul and body is di&s;&s;olved. But though dead, he yet &s;peaks, by his examples, works, writings, and the ble&s;&s;ings he procured for us. Can we enjoy the ble&s;&s;ing of liberty, and live in the plea|&s;ures of freedom, and forget the name of WASHING|TON? No; he lives in the heart of every virtuous &s;on of Columbia, and it is only with ineffable plea&s;ure they &s;ound his name. As the I&s;raelites re&s;pect the charac|ter of Mo&s;es, who brought them from the bondage of Egypt within &s;ight of the promi&s;ed land, &s;o may every virtuous American remember the worthy deeds of WASHINGTON, who delivered us from a yoke of bon|dage that neither we nor our fathers were able to bear, even a foreign yoke; the avarice of prie&s;ts, hereditary governors, and church e&s;tabli&s;hments, which are en|gines of oppre&s;&s;ion, and the yokes of tyranny. He brought us not only within &s;ight of the ble&s;&s;ings of li|berty, but, like Jo&s;hua, led us into the very enjoyment and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. While I &s;peak, my heart grows warm. I feel a mea&s;ure of gratitude that I can|not
<PB N="19" REF="037558_0019_100EDB7DC81AAD30">
de&s;cribe. Before my infant heart knew the value of the ble&s;&s;ings I now enjoy, my Father and your Father was in the field, fighting to procure them for us. My indignation ri&s;es again&s;t the American who refu&s;es to pay &s;uitable re&s;pect to the memory of WASHINGTON. If &s;uch a man there be, &s;urely he ought not to eat his bread on the American &s;hores: let him give place to hundreds and thou&s;ands in Europe more grateful than he, who would willingly come to this delightful and plea&s;ant land of liberty, if they had it in their power. I would advi&s;e him to go among his brethren of the Indian tribes. Alas! they would &s;uppo&s;e their &s;ociety polluted by the company of &s;uch a wretch, and would con&s;equently expel him from among them. When thus expelled, let him join his &s;able brethren on the African &s;hores. Even they would prote&s;t, the colour of their &s;kin is not more black than his heart is ba&s;e. But I hold, and charitably hope, there is not a wretch &s;o vile in this a&s;&s;embly. What! a man who daily lives in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e liberties WASHINGTON procured for him, and glories in the enjoyment of them, and yet refu&s;es to pay &s;uitable re&s;pect to his memory! Forbid it, Heaven!</P>
<P>Your ance&s;tors came to this continent from the i&s;land of Great Britain; they fled from oppre&s;&s;ive power, and not far from this &s;pot made their fir&s;t &s;et|tlement. When their mother country made encroach|ments on their liberties, they remon&s;trated, but in vain; they then had recour&s;e to arms, and called on WASHINGTON to head their troops: he complied, fought, bled, and conquered. Shall we, their po&s;teri|ty, be guilty of an act that would have made our vir|tuous fathers blu&s;h? No, my countrymen; let grati|tude ari&s;e from your hearts, and teach po&s;terity the no|ble deeds of our illu&s;trious Chief. Begin with your children in the cradle; let their fir&s;t in&s;tructions be,
<PB N="20" REF="037558_0020_100ED275F6BE6B68">
the prai&s;e of GOD, and the principles of CHRISTIANI|TY; then teach them to li&s;p the name of WASHING|TON&mdash;the name ever dear to all the virtuous friends of liberty. The American may travel to the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the world, where the &s;ons of Colum|bia are known as a nation, and need not blu&s;h when he is told, WASHINGTON commanded your armies; a WASHINGTON &s;tood at the helm of your govern|ment. Europeans may blu&s;h when they &s;ee the vices of their princes expo&s;ed, their ignorance de&s;cribed, or their cruelty reprobated: but the Glory of Columbia had no apparent imperfections; con&s;equently it is not in the power of enemies to reproach us on his ac|count; we bid defiance to the tongue of calumny. "He was the heroic General, patriotic State&s;man and virtuous Sage." I &s;hall &s;hortly &s;ail for England: if I arrive &s;afely there, I will carry with me this badge of mourning, and inform tho&s;e with whom I am or may be acquainted, that I, with Columbia's &s;ons, mourn the lo&s;s of a political father, even the great, the admi|rable WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>I was in this town when I fir&s;t heard the doleful news of his death: the tolling of the bell fir&s;t excited my curio&s;ity, then depre&s;&s;ed my &s;oul in &s;orrow. I could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing my grief. The &s;ound echoes from city to city, from town to town, and from grove to grove&mdash;WASHINGTON is no more! the great, the good, the virtuous WASHINGTON is no more! While the brave &s;ons of America, and the fair daughters of Co|lumbia, hang their heads, and torrents of tears &s;tream from either eye, they &s;mite their brea&s;ts, and cry, Oh, my father! my father! the chariot of I&s;rael, and the hor&s;emen thereof! Alas! for the Glory of Columbia is no more! Her Sun is &s;et! while they &s;ay to each other, in accents of &s;orrow, A prince and a great man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his day fallen on the &s;hores of Columbia. The

mirth of youth is taken away, and the voice of mourn|ing is heard. Age feels the quick emotion: his feeble hand wipes from his venerable cheek the tear that in&s;en|&s;ibly &s;tole from his eye, while he exclaims, in mourning accents, Help, Lord, for the godly man cea&s;eth, for the faithful fail from among the children of men. O, my brethern, the Lord hath taken away the mighty man, the man of war, the prudent man, and the coun&s;ellor: WASHINGTON is no more. You that fought by his &s;ide when he bore the heat and burden of the day al|mo&s;t alone&mdash;his courage animated you, his virtues awed you; you who loved him as a father, command|er and protector, with what pain did you receive the unwelcome tidings, and now what emotions do you feel, when you reflect on the great lo&s;s you and your country have &s;u&s;tained! Kind &s;ouls, you weep&mdash;Ah! the&s;e are precious drops&mdash;drops of pity that fall on the princely urn of your beloved WASHINGTON. To weep on this occa&s;ion is manly; not to weep, would be &s;toical. Well may we weep when we have rea&s;on to fear his equal is not left behind. O, what a trea&s;ure have we lo&s;t by the death of our illu&s;trious Chief, who was our &s;upport in war, our guide in peace! When I con&s;ider his worthy actions, and eminent merit, me|thinks I &s;ee him &s;tand before his Judge, hearing the ble&s;&s;ed plaudit&mdash;Well done, good and faithful &s;ervant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. This is the con|&s;olation left us: The memory of this Ju&s;t Man &s;hall ever be, as it now is, ble&s;&s;ed. He is one of tho&s;e righ|teous that &s;hall be in everla&s;ting remembrance.</P>
<P>Let us, my brethren, improve the advice he has left behind. Let us cultivate that liberty he has pro|cured for us, and not make it a cloak of la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s. Let us &s;hew to the world, that WASHINGTON has made us free, and taught us how to pre&s;erve our liber|ty; and that we, as obedient children, will follow his
<PB N="22" REF="037558_0022_100EDB8300A5E8A8">
advice; that it may never be &s;aid of Columbia, WASH|INGTON laboured for her in vain.</P>
<P>May his death remind us of our approaching di&s;&s;olu|tion. May we &s;ee the impartiality of death; and if the great and good fall before him, if &s;uch as WASH|INGTON mu&s;t die, let us remember how frail we are, and now apply our hearts unto wi&s;dom. We &s;hall &s;ee him here no more. He cannot return to us, but we &s;hall go to him. May we this day begin the important work of preparing to meet our God. Time is &s;hort; eternity is ju&s;t at hand: let us be diligent. A great and important work is before us&mdash;a God to &s;erve, a heaven to obtain, and a hell to &s;hun. And as we are dying daily, God forbid that we &s;hould be negligent. We have privileges great and many. We may &s;it un|der our own vine, and none to make us afraid. Let us improve the&s;e opportunities, and while we enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty, both civil and religious, may we with profound re&s;pect verberate the names of FRANK|LIN, MONTGOMERY, WARREN, GREENE, and WASHINGTON.</P>
