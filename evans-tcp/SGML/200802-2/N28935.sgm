<BIBL>II SAMUEL, i. 27.</BIBL>
<Q>HOW ARE THE MIGHTY FALLEN, AND THE WEAPONS OF WAR PERISHED!</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FROM a very ancient date in the hi&s;tory of human affairs, mankind have been in the practice of celebrating by words or more &s;ub&s;tantial monuments, the virtues and heroic exploits of the dead. In republican governments e&s;pecially, the funeral oration has been rarely omitted, in the ca&s;e of the more con&s;picuous, de&s;erving citizen. The Grecian &s;tates, early commenced the u&s;age: Rome followed their example, not only through the period of her greater glory, but down nearly to that of her lowe&s;t decline;&mdash;the more recent revival of letters and &s;ocial improvement, having by no means di&s;con|tinued the whole of the kind. Doing ju&s;tice to the memory of departed worth, has much to be &s;aid in its favour. A rich &s;ource of plea&s;ing emotion to the feeling grateful heart it cannot fail to operate powerfully upon &s;ur|vivers, to &s;tudy the careful imitation of what they &s;o much delight to extol.</P>

BUT with the public celebration of decea&s;|ed merit, thus &s;trongly recommended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dif|ferent grounds; it admits and no doubt often experiences gro&s;s abu&s;e. The high wrought encomium of our text and its im|mediate connection, is perhaps not &s;o perfectly de&s;erved as could be wi&s;hed. Saul and his &s;on Jonathan were its &s;ubjects, &s;carcely any thing being to be &s;aid to the advantage of the form|er, but that he was "the Lord's anointed" and the latter a mere youth, of whom, the mo&s;t that we know is, that he was per&s;onally brave and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of an unu&s;ually friend|ly heart. Over the&s;e two per&s;ons it was, that David gave utterance to his grief, in that beau|tiful lamentation, of which the Text is a part. It is a lamentation, which does honor, both to the talents and feelings of its author. It has de&s;ervedly immortalized <HI>him,</HI> as a man who knew how to forgive injuries, and who&s;e at|tachment to his friend, was without duplicity and per&s;evering.</P>
<P>"And David lamented with this lamenta|tion over Saul, and over Jonathan his &s;on. The beauty of I&s;rael is &s;lain upon thy high places; how are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath, publi&s;h it not in the &s;treets of A&s;ke|lon: left the daughters of the Phili&s;tines re|joice, left the daughters of the uncircumci&s;|ed

triumph. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the &s;hield of the mighty is vilely ca&s;t away, the &s;hield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. From the blood of the &s;lain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jona|than turned not back, and the &s;word of Saul returned not empty. Saul and Jonathan, were lovely and plea&s;ant in their lives, and in their death they they were not divided; they were &s;wifter than eagles, they were &s;tronger than lions. Ye daughters of I&s;rael, weep over Saul, who clothed you in &s;carlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel. How are the mighty fallen in the mid&s;t of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wa&s;t &s;lain in thine high places. I am di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very plea|&s;ant ha&s;t thou been unto me; thy love to me was wonderful, pa&s;&s;ing the love of women&mdash;<HI>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed!"</HI></P>
<P>WITHOUT farther di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the que&s;tion, whether this <HI>high eulogy</HI> was a matter of &s;trict de&s;ert, in view of tho&s;e who were originally its &s;ubjects; of this I am confident, that it has been de&s;erved in the ca&s;e of others. It &s;hall accordingly be the twofold object of the re|maining part of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e; to de|lineate

<P>IN delineating the character worthy of high commendation, and of cour&s;e to be univer&s;al|ly and deeply lamented, at his death:&mdash;I &s;hall begin with mentioning the one, who has de|&s;erved well, in <HI>military</HI> office. It being the di&s;a&s;trous fate of the warrior, which dictated the pa&s;&s;age we are now reviewing, naturally gives the lead to the pre&s;ent remark. In thus holding to view military &s;kill and exertion as ranking among the virtues of life, far be it from me to &s;tand forth an approver, of a very large proportion of tho&s;e, who have &s;hone and and acquired eminence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame, in &s;uch a de|partment. <HI>Ambitious murderers&mdash;expert a&s;&s;a|&s;&s;ins&mdash;unfeeling incendiaries</HI>&mdash;are rather op|probrious names, which by no means do ju&s;tice to their real guilt and infamy.

Hence the addre&s;s of God, to Cyrus, a man de&s;ervedly celebrated, both in &s;acred and profane hi&s;tory. "Thus &s;aith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, who&s;e right hand I have holden, to &s;ubdue nations before him; and I will loo&s;e the loins of kings to open before him the two-leaved gates, and the gates &s;hall not be &s;hut. I will go before thee, and make the crooked places &s;traight; I will brake in pieces the gates of bra&s;s, and cut in &s;under the bars of iron. For Jacob my &s;ervants &s;ake and I&s;rael mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have &s;irnamed thee, though thou ha&s;t not known me. I am the Lord, and there is none el&s;e, there is no God be&s;ide me; I girded thee, though thou ha&s;t not known me: That they may know from the ri&s;ing of the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and from the we&s;t, that there is none be|&s;ide me, I am the Lord, and there is none el&s;e"&mdash;So long as that &s;pirit of national inju&s;tice and aggre&s;&s;ion continues in the world, of which no pa&s;t period has been wholly free, defen|&s;ive war will be nece&s;&s;ary and altogether ju&s;tifiable;&mdash;of cour&s;e tho&s;e &s;kilful to wield the &s;word, are de&s;ervedly to be held in high e&s;teem, by their brethren.

taken away, the family &s;anctuary made a place of lawle&s;s intru&s;ion, and even the &s;anc|tuary of the great Jehovah, with all its religious in&s;titutions and &s;olemnities, tram|pled under foot; thus verifying, what David long &s;ince complained of;&mdash;and indeed, which various parts of our own country, not many years pa&s;t, exemplified. "They have ca&s;t fire into thy &s;anctuary, they have defiled by ca&s;ting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground. They &s;aid in their hearts, let us de&s;troy them together. We &s;ee not our &s;igns, there is no more any prophet, neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. O God, how long &s;hall the adver&s;ary re|proach? &s;hall the enemy bla&s;pheme thy name for ever?" As mu&s;t be a matter univer&s;ally conced|ed, the man of war, who under God, is made the in&s;trument of alleviating and ultimately re|dre&s;&s;ing &s;uch a truly unwelcome &s;tate of things, de&s;erves at his death undi&s;&s;embled and univer|&s;al lamentation.</P>
<P>AGAIN, we are abundantly authorized to lament the man, who has &s;hone as a di&s;inter|e&s;ted &s;tate&s;man.&mdash;To be great in war and to be great in peace, require very different attri|butes of character, &s;eldom united.

its internal civil concerns with propri|ety, amid the jarring feelings and oppo&s;ite in|ere&s;ts of millions. Of all departments of ad|mini&s;tration, that of the republican chief ma|gi&s;trate, is far the mo&s;t critical and arduous. To be the &s;ucce&s;sful and approved helm&s;man of a nation, requires a va&s;t combination of fore&s;ight, energy, and per&s;everance, rarely the lot of mortals. The fatigue and anxiety of &s;uch an office, mu&s;t be incalculable.&mdash;To keep in order the complicated wheels of national government, is a laborious un|dertaking; though a far greater one, to put them fir&s;t in motion. It is beyond the reach of wealth, to compen&s;ate adequately &s;uch a ta&s;k;&mdash;how truly noble then to do it with|out the &s;malle&s;t pecuniary reward, as the re|&s;ult, of pure love of country. Certainly the able &s;tate&s;man, uncompen&s;ated unle&s;s by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing good, fully merits the rich tribute, of being held in the grateful re|membrance, of his &s;urviving cotemporaries and po&s;terity.</P>
<P>How worthy al&s;o, to be lamented is the man who has unvaryingly di&s;played, un&s;haken at|tachment to the con&s;titution and laws of his country.&mdash;Convinced of the true con&s;truction to be put, upon the great <HI>palladium</HI> of nation|al exi&s;tence and liberty, in this or the other of its articles; nothing is able to make him depart from it, in the &s;malle&s;t degree. Amid

the ri&s;k of popularity, the colli&s;ion of parties, the &s;olicitations of the crafty, and the invectives of di&s;apointed ambition; he remains immove|able&mdash;tenaciou&s;ly fixed on what he conceives to be right. Truly difficult as it many times is, for the &s;upreme head of a nation, to avoid the imputation of ob&s;tinacy, while pur&s;uing the-line of rational manly firmne&s;s; &s;till it is a line, for which he will never fail, mo&s;t indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly to aim. Feeling the ju&s;tice of the in|&s;pired remark "that in a multitude of coun|&s;ellors, there is &s;afety" he li&s;tens to the whole which can be &s;aid; tho not without afterwads, both thinking and acting for him&s;elf. Far greater confidence may be &s;afely repo&s;ed in &s;uch a man, than in one, who while he en|deavours to plea&s;e all, is very certain of hav|ing his admini&s;tration but too exactly an&s;wer to an apo&s;tles pointed de&s;cription "for he that wavereth is like a wave of the &s;ea, driven of the wind and to&s;&s;ed&mdash;for let not that man think that he &s;hall receive any thing of the Lord."</P>
<P>FURTHER, how de&s;erving of lamentation at his death is the one, who while engaged in public life, &s;hewed him&s;elf &s;uperior to the van|ity of adulation, and the &s;educements of am|bition.&mdash;The conque&s;t of &s;elf in &s;uch re|&s;pects, is far the greate&s;t conque&s;t, which hu|man nature is able to achieve.

the humble man amid the unqualified applau&s;es of millions, and that not barely for a day but for years, &s;hews &s;elf-command&mdash;di&s;plays greatne&s;s of &s;oul, next to divine. Thus made con&s;cious of acting a noble part and de&s;erving well; the plea&s;ure thence re&s;ulting, does not &s;tand confined to the narrow limits of a &s;elfi&s;h heart, but diffu&s;es it&s;elf abroad&mdash;ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lts in the idea of national peace and improvement, aggrandizement and felicity.&mdash;The per|&s;on who&s;e feelings and views are of the &s;up|po&s;ed benevolent ca&s;t, with entire cheerfulne&s;s, quits the pinnacle of high elevation, the fir&s;t moment circum&s;tances will allow. It was not to be made great, but to do great good, that he con&s;ented to ri&s;e; of cour&s;e it being the fir&s;t object of his wi&s;hes, again to enjoy a peace|ful and dignified retirement. How truly for|tunate would it be for the world, did the in|ve&s;titure with exten&s;ive authority, in all in&s;tan|ces, do &s;o little to deprave the heart&mdash;that in the place of retaining power, for the purpo&s;e of en&s;laving and making mi&s;erable; it was relinqui&s;hed with equal or greater &s;atisfaction, than what it was originally received.</P>
<P>ONCE more, worthy indeed to be lament|ed is the man, who&s;e private life has been a continued &s;eries of beneficence, un&s;tained by vice, and who witne&s;&s;ed a &s;acred regard to the truth and power of religion. How compara|tively

contemptible are the mo&s;t brilliant per|&s;onal qualities, with all the adventitious celebri|ty which an elevated department for action, can give to them, unaccompanied by a moral con|ver&s;ation and the true fear of God. With vir|tuous principles and practices, the e&s;&s;ence of real dignity in the ob&s;cure citizen; they are inconceivably more commanding and u&s;eful, when the attribute of high life. The great man, who manife&s;ts reverence for religion and its in&s;titutions, demon&s;trates his full con|viction of their reality and importance. He &s;hews him&s;elf &s;uperior to the &s;plendid tempta|tions of a &s;educing world, and proclaims aloud to his fellow worms "that there is one thing needful; a good part which &s;hall not be taken away."</P>
<P>I have now detailed, with de&s;igned brevity, a few leading features of character which more than authorize&mdash;which peremptorily enjoin, the mo&s;t feeling lamentation.

<P>As I am &s;ure is needle&s;s to inform you, my Brethren, the pa&s;t remarks are by no means tho&s;e, of the mere <HI>&s;peculati&s;t.</HI>&mdash;They are not the produce of imagination, but have been penned from <HI>actual life.</HI></P>

<P>A few inferences, may now clo&s;e the pre|&s;ent attempt.</P>
<P>IN view of what has been offered, how clearly are we taught&mdash;how forceably have we urged upon us, the idea of a future immortal exi&s;tence. It cannot be, that &s;o much innate worth&mdash;&s;uch complicated de&s;ert of charac|ter&mdash;and unfeigned fear of the great Jehovah, as marked the man we this day lament, &s;hould peri&s;h in the grave. No, my Brethren, the mo&s;t glorious triumph of our departed Hero and Father, is yet to arrive.

to God's holy unerring providence. The cup of national judgement put into our hands to drink, is indeed very bitter; tho' let it not be forgotten, that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an intermixture of &s;weetne&s;s. Our tears ought to a degree, to be tho&s;e of gratitude&mdash;gratitude that kind heaven &s;aw fit to rai&s;e up &s;o great a Worthy, that he has been &s;o eminently guided by di|vine coun&s;el, and allowed to live and be u&s;e|ful, to a good old age.</P>
<P>THE reflections we have been indulging, like|wi&s;e, &s;trongly recommend attachment to the con&s;titution and varied intere&s;ts of our country. A deep blu&s;h ought to cover the face of tho&s;e, who pretend to mourn for our departed Wa&s;h|ington, and yet make it their daily effort to un|der mine that noble edifice of liberty and go|vernment, which has been the idol of his wi&s;hes, the work of his life, and no doubt the &s;ubject of his frequent and mo&s;t &s;ervent prayers. The <HI>urn</HI> of &s;o great and good a patriot, is too &s;acred to be wet with the tears, <HI>of foul hy|pocri&s;y.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible that real gratitude to the father of his country and the feelings of the parricide, &s;hould ever unite in the &s;ame heart.</P>
<P>THE addre&s;s of the pa&s;t di&s;cour&s;e is al&s;o, mo&s;t pointed and forcible, in favor of the vir|tuous exemplary life.&mdash;If it is not to be ex|pected or wi&s;hed, that we &s;hould all be heroes

The more humble virtues <HI>"of the greate&s;t man who ever lived"</HI> formed out, by no means the lea&s;t e&s;timable part of his char|acter.</P>
<P>To conclude, let the &s;olemn providence which has been the burden of our remarks at this time, deeply impre&s;s every mind, in view of the inconceivably intere&s;ting article of death. Would the armed de&s;troyer of our race, not pa&s;s by <HI>"heavens favorite &s;on,"</HI> he certainly will not pa&s;s by us.

The &s;mall and great are there, and the &s;ervant is free from his ma&s;ter, "the object which ought to be that of chief &s;olicitude with us all, being &s;o to live the life of the righteous, "that our la&s;t end be like his."</P>
