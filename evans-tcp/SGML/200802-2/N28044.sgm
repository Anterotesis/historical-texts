<Q><HI>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed!</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN David fir&s;t heard of the death of his father and of his friend, he was deeply af|fected, and di&s;covered the &s;tronge&s;t marks of un|feigned &s;orrow. "Then he took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewi&s;e all the men that were with him; and they mourned and wept until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his &s;on, and for the people of the Lord, and for the hou&s;e of I&s;rael." As the remains of the&s;e illu&s;trious war|riors were in the power of their enemies, David could not, as he did on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, follow them to their graves, and weep over them there. But all that he could do, in his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, he did. Being no le&s;s expert with his pen, than with his lyre and &s;pear, he poured forth the tender emo|tions of his heart in a &s;olemn, plaintive, funeral dirge. Though he felt a warmer attachment to Jo|nathan
<PB N="6" REF="037369_0004_100CEE5E1EA8BD58">
than to Saul, yet in celebrating their vir|tues, their talents, and their public &s;ervices, he pays them an equal tribute of public re&s;pect. He en|deavors, with all his poetic &s;kill, to in&s;pire the whole nation with the &s;ame &s;en&s;ibilities, which he felt in his own bo&s;om, and calls upon them, in the mo&s;t pathetic &s;trains, to unite in deploring the un|timely decea&s;e of the great ornaments and bene|factors of their country. "How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed!" Our lo&s;s is great and irreparable! The death of our generals is the death of our hopes and the de&s;truc|tion of our arms! Our national calamity calls for our national mourning, lamentation, and &s;or|row. The&s;e are the &s;entiments, which this beau|tiful poem was de&s;igned to inculcate. And the&s;e are the &s;entiments, which every people ought to feel and to expre&s;s, when tho&s;e, who have been eminently u&s;eful in life, are laid in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>To de&s;cribe men of eminence, and to &s;how the propriety of lamenting their death, will be the bu|&s;ine&s;s of the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>No man was made merely for him&s;elf, but all men for the &s;ervice of each other. U&s;efulne&s;s, therefore, does not &s;o much con&s;i&s;t in &s;eeking our private, per&s;onal happine&s;s, as in promoting the general welfare of all with whom we are any way concerned. Though mo&s;t men are capable of do|ing
<PB N="7" REF="037369_0005_100CEE60CD9036B8">
&s;omething for others as well as for them&s;elves; yet only a few individuals po&s;&s;e&s;s either talents, opportunities, or inclinations, to become exten|&s;ively u&s;eful. And among the&s;e there are &s;o many degrees of merit, that it is extremely difficult to de|termine the preci&s;e point, where mediocrity ends and eminence begins. It is ea&s;y, however, to give a general de&s;cription of tho&s;e, in various depart|ments of life, who&s;e uncommon exertions for the public good ju&s;tly place them in the noble rank of eminent men.</P>
<P>Since the general good of &s;ociety requires par|ticular per&s;ons to devote them&s;elves to particular employments, any individual, of a &s;uperior genius and of an enterprizing &s;pirit, may become emi|nently u&s;eful, in any lawful profe&s;&s;ion. The theo|retical farmer, who &s;pares no labor nor expence, in trying experiments, and in di&s;covering the ea&s;i|e&s;t and be&s;t modes of cultivating the earth, is an eminent citizen. The man, who pur&s;ues the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of commerce upon the broad ba&s;is of gene|ral utility, promotes the public good as well as his own, and is exten&s;ively u&s;eful to his country. The man, who, by clo&s;e application and critical ob&s;er|vation, makes advances in the healing art, and employs his &s;uperior &s;kill in relieving the pains and maladies of his fellow men, is a great public ble&s;&s;ing. The man of genius and integrity, who
<PB N="8" REF="037369_0006_100CEE625FE3AA70">
is profoundly learned in the law, and who exerts all his abilities in promoting the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice and defending the rights of his fellow citizens, does honor to his profe&s;&s;ion, and contributes large|ly to the general good of civil &s;ociety. In a word, every one of a public &s;pirit and &s;uperior talents, who makes it his &s;upreme object, in his private em|ployment, to promote the public happine&s;s, is an eminently u&s;eful man.</P>
<P>There is a higher cla&s;s of eminent men, who move in the higher walks of life. The&s;e, in&s;tead of &s;eeking merely the honors and emoluments of office, have &s;o much greatne&s;s of mind and good|ne&s;s of heart, as to employ their public and im|portant &s;tations, as the means of more public and exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s. On this eminent li&s;t we ought to place all tho&s;e, who &s;hine with a peculiar lu&s;tre, either in the &s;eats of learning, or in the courts of ju&s;tice, or in the councils of &s;tate, or in the &s;u|preme command of fleets and armies.</P>
<P>But there are &s;ome who ri&s;e higher &s;till on the &s;cale of u&s;efulne&s;s; I mean tho&s;e, who extend their views beyond the limits of their own nation or country, and exert their influence to promote the general good of all mankind. There are a few individuals, among the many millions of our race, who have heads and hearts equal to &s;uch a great,
<PB N="9" REF="037369_0007_100CEE646139A550">
exten&s;ive, and benevolent de&s;ign. It mu&s;t be al|lowed by all, that the Inventors of u&s;eful arts and &s;ciences, the Founders of civil, religious, and literary in&s;titutions, and the Deliverers of nations and kingdoms from &s;lavery and ruin, are the mo&s;t illu&s;trious and eminently u&s;eful men in the world. The happy effects of their great and noble exer|tions, will continue and increa&s;e to the remote&s;t periods of time.</P>
<P>When &s;uch eminently great and u&s;eful men are removed from the &s;tage of life, their removal is a public calamity, which calls for public mourning and &s;orrow. All nations have felt the propriety of lamenting the lo&s;s of tho&s;e who have been emi|nently u&s;eful in life, and of paying them peculiar honors at death. This appears from the practice of the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, and e&s;pecially from the funeral rites of the Jews, at the decea&s;e and interment of their eminent Judges, Generals, Kings, Prie&s;ts, Prophets, and Patriarchs. When the pi|ous Patriarch Jacob died in Egypt, his death was publicly lamented, by a mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;plendid funeral. His body being embalmed, the Egyp|tians mourned for him <HI>three&s;core and ten days.</HI> And after this we are told, "Jo&s;eph went up to bu|ry his father; and with him went up <HI>all the &s;er|vants</HI> of Pharaoh, <HI>the elders</HI> of his hou&s;e, and <HI>all the elders</HI> of the land of Egypt. And <HI>all the hou&s;e</HI> of Jo|&s;eph,
<PB N="10" REF="037369_0008_100CEEB2E88D87E0">
and <HI>his brethren</HI> and <HI>his father's</HI> hou&s;e. And there went up with him both <HI>chariots</HI> and <HI>hor&s;emen:</HI> and <HI>it was a very great company.</HI> And they came to the thre&s;hing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they <HI>mourned with a great and very &s;ore lamentation;</HI> and <HI>he made a mourning for his fath|er &s;even days.</HI> And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, <HI>&s;aw the mourning</HI> in the floor of Atad, they &s;aid, This is a <HI>grievous mourning</HI> to the Egyptians." The decea&s;e of Aaron on his jour|ney to Canaan was deeply regretted. "When all the congregation &s;aw that Aaron was dead, <HI>they mourned</HI> for Aaron <HI>thirty days,</HI> even <HI>all the hou&s;e</HI> of I&s;rael." Though Mo&s;es, the &s;ervant of the Lord and king in Je&s;hurun, died and was buried in pri|vate; yet his death was publicly and univer&s;ally lamented. It is recorded to his honor, that "the children of I&s;rael <HI>wept</HI> for Mo&s;es in the plains of Moab <HI>thirty days:</HI> &s;o the days of <HI>weeping and mourn|ing</HI> for Mo&s;es were ended." Samuel was an emi|nent Prophet and Judge in I&s;rael, and his death was deplored as a national lo&s;s. We read, "<HI>All the I&s;raelites</HI> were gathered together, and <HI>lamented</HI> him, and buried him in his hou&s;e at Ramah." Our text and context contain the lamentation, occa&s;ion|ed by the premature and &s;udden death of Saul and Jonathan. In a few chapters forward, we find a particular account of the funeral honors paid to an eminent General, who fell by the hand of an
<PB N="11" REF="037369_0009_100CEE660ACF5580">
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. "And David &s;aid to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with &s;ackcloth and <HI>mourn</HI> before Abner. And king David him&s;elf followed the bier. And they buried Abner in Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and <HI>wept</HI> at the grave of Ab|ner; and <HI>all the people wept.</HI> And the king &s;aid to his &s;ervants, Know ye not that there is a prince and great man fallen this day in I&s;rael?" Of Je|hoiada the prie&s;t we read, that "he waxed old, and was full of days when he died. And they bu|ried him in the city of David, <HI>among the kings,</HI> be|cau&s;e <HI>he had done good in I&s;rael,</HI> both toward God, and toward his hou&s;e." It is recorded of Hezeki|ah, that pious prince and eminent reformer, that "he &s;lept with his fathers, and they buried him <HI>in the chiefe&s;t of the &s;epulchres of the &s;ons of David.</HI> And <HI>all Judah</HI> and <HI>the inhabitants</HI> of Jeru&s;alem <HI>did him honor</HI> at his death." The &s;ame religious people more deeply lamented the untimely death of Jo|&s;iah, and paid a more public and la&s;ting re&s;pect to his memory. The account of his death and of their conduct is very &s;triking. "And the archers &s;hot at king Jo&s;iah, and the king &s;aid to his &s;er|vants, Have me away; for I am wounded. His &s;ervants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him into the &s;econd chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jeru&s;alem, and he died, and was buried in one of the &s;epulchres of his
<PB N="12" REF="037369_0010_100CEE69E0C52900">
fathers. And <HI>all Judah and Jeru&s;alem mourned</HI> for Jo&s;iah: and the &s;inging-men and &s;inging-women &s;pake of Jo&s;iah <HI>in their lamentations to this day;</HI> and made them <HI>an ordinance</HI> in I&s;rael." Though God often reproved his antient people for paying reli|gious homage to the idols of the Heathens; yet we never find, that he reproved them for paying fu|neral honors to departed men of &s;uperior merit, among their own nation. Their example in this re&s;pect, therefore, &s;eems to have a divine &s;anction, and plainly teaches us the propriety of lamenting the death and commemorating the virtues of tho&s;e, who have been eminently u&s;eful in life. But the propriety of this may be &s;till further illu&s;trated. Here then permit me to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. The death of eminent men never fails to di|mini&s;h the glory of a people. Such illu&s;trious characters are the ornaments of human nature, and of the nation to which they belong. Multi|tudes, whom God has endued with noble talents, and favored with peculiar opportunities of doing good, either bury or abu&s;e their intellectual pow|ers, and become a reproach to their country as well as to their race. But tho&s;e do honor to their nature and to their nation, who di&s;play &s;uperior a|bilities, by a &s;eries of great and noble actions. A few &s;uch illu&s;trious characters will render a nation re&s;pectable in the eyes of all the world. The Gre|cians
<PB N="13" REF="037369_0011_100CEE6B6FDB6B48">
were never very rich, nor very numerous, and yet there never was a more renowned nation on earth. Their eminent men have commanded the re&s;pect and admiration of all &s;ucceeding ages. Great and good characters are a greater glory to any nation, than all their wealth and numbers. Whenever, therefore, their greate&s;t and be&s;t men are removed by death, their glory departs, and they nece&s;&s;arily &s;ink in the view of &s;urrounding nations. This &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t idea, which &s;truck the mind of David, in compo&s;ing his mournful ele|gy on the death of Saul and Jonathan. "The <HI>beauty</HI> of I&s;rael is &s;lain upon the high places." As their lives had increa&s;ed, &s;o their death dimini&s;hed, the glory of their nation. And any people have rea&s;on to lament the lo&s;s of their glory, when they are bereaved of the fathers and friends of their country.</P>
<P N="2">2. The death of eminent men not only dimin|i&s;hes the glory, but weakens the &s;trength, of a people. Wi&s;dom is better than weapons of war. The &s;trength of a nation lies in the heads and hearts of tho&s;e, who have the care and direction of the national concerns. A people may po&s;&s;e&s;s a very rich &s;oil, a very exten&s;ive country, and very am|ple re&s;ources of wealth; and yet be extremely weak and defencele&s;s, merely for the want of able men, to pre&s;ide in their councils, and to lead in their
<PB N="14" REF="037369_0012_100CEE6D15461F08">
armies. This was frequently the ca&s;e in the Jew|i&s;h nation. In the time of Jo&s;hua, they were &s;trong, and &s;truck terror into all their enemies; but after his decea&s;e, though they increa&s;ed in num|bers, yet they declined in &s;trength, and became an ea&s;y prey to every people, who had courage enough to invade their country. In the days of David they were again univer&s;ally re&s;pected and revered; but in &s;ucceeding ages, the want of wi&s;e and valiant men expo&s;ed them to poverty, mean|ne&s;s, and &s;lavery. The &s;trength of the mo&s;t pow|erful nations has often been &s;u&s;pended upon the exertions of a &s;ingle warrior or &s;tate&s;man. Alex|ander rai&s;ed the Grecians to the empire of the world, and that empire was &s;u&s;pended upon his life; for his death divided and di&s;&s;olved his exten|&s;ive dominions. Though it is not very common|ly the ca&s;e, that a &s;ingle per&s;on is the &s;ole &s;upport of a people; yet the death of one who &s;ways either the &s;ceptre or the &s;word, never &s;ails to give a great national &s;hock, and to weaken either the civil or the military &s;trength of the kingdom. David was deeply impre&s;&s;ed with this painful thought, while deploring the death of tho&s;e, who fell in the de|fence of their country. "How are the mighty fallen!" He repeats the &s;ad reflection. "How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;h|ed!" What avail all our numbers, all our fortre&s;|&s;es, and all our national re&s;ources, after our mighty
<PB N="15" REF="037369_0013_100CEE6FD45E7658">
men of valor, wi&s;dom, and experience, are laid in the du&s;t! The &s;ame &s;entiment he expre&s;&s;ed with greater &s;en&s;ibility on the death of Abner. "I am this day weak, though anointed king." A nation often &s;u&s;tains a greater lo&s;s by the death of an able General, than by the defeat of a numerous army. For it is much ea&s;ier to recruit a numerous army, than to replace a renowned General. No men have been more &s;incerely and univer&s;ally lament|ed than tho&s;e brave and mighty Generals, who have fallen in the field of battle, and by their death depre&s;&s;ed the hearts, and weakened the hands, of a whole nation. A people, therefore, can never have a greater cau&s;e for public mourning and la|mentation, than the lo&s;s of noble patriots and war|riors, who have been the &s;trength and protection, as well as ornaments, of their country. I may add,</P>
<P N="3">3. The removal of wi&s;e, virtuous, and valuable men from a people is not only a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, but an alarming di&s;pen&s;ation of divine providence. It indicates, that God is about to bring a train of hea|vy judgments upon them, for their ingratitude, and abu&s;e of public ble&s;&s;ings. He often took away from the hou&s;e of I&s;rael their greate&s;t and be&s;t men, as a prelude to a &s;eries of national calamities. This appears from his expre&s;s declaration, by the mouth of the prophet I&s;aiah. "Behold, the Lord,
<PB N="16" REF="037369_0014_100CEE723478D898">
the Lord of ho&s;ts, doth take away from Jeru&s;alem, and from Judah the <HI>mighty</HI> man, the man <HI>of war,</HI> the <HI>judge,</HI> and the <HI>prophet,</HI> and the <HI>prudent,</HI> and the <HI>ancient,</HI> the <HI>captain</HI> of fifty, and the <HI>honorable</HI> man, and the <HI>coun&s;ellor,</HI> and the <HI>cunning</HI> artificer, and the <HI>eloquent</HI> orator." This was a heavy calamity in it|&s;elf, and a pre&s;age of impending judgments. For it is added, "And I will give <HI>children</HI> to be their princes, and <HI>babes</HI> &s;hall rule over them, and the people &s;hall be <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed.</HI>" We often find a train of evils following the death of great and good men in I&s;rael. After the death of Jo&s;hua and of the elders that outlived him, the people fell into licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s, anarchy, and confu&s;ion, from which they never recovered, until the days of David. Solo|mon was a prince of peace, and rai&s;ed the nation to the &s;ummit of earthly glory; but his death di|vided the kingdom, and threw the twelve tribes into all the horrors and mi&s;eries of civil war; the fatal con&s;equences of which remain to this day. When a pillar of the &s;tate is taken away, it never fails to weaken or un&s;ettle the whole frame of gov|ernment. While the celebrated Pitt guided the national councils of Britain, &s;ucce&s;s crowned all her enterprizes; but as &s;oon as he cea&s;ed to breathe and to &s;peak, her councils were di&s;tracted, her &s;chemes were bla&s;ted, and &s;he &s;u&s;tained a lo&s;s, which will never be repaired. It has often hap|pened in the cour&s;e of human affairs, that a king|dom
<PB N="17" REF="037369_0015_100CEE73C68290A0">
has fallen, by the death of a &s;ingle &s;tate&s;man or warrior. And it ought to be remembered, that what has been, may be again. God &s;everely frowns upon a people, when he takes away their great and u&s;eful men; and at the &s;ame time, threatens them with &s;till further tokens of his awful di&s;plea&s;|ure. This &s;hows the duty, as well as the proprie|ty, of their going into mourning, under the bereav|ing hand of his providence, which has laid tho&s;e in the du&s;t, who once gave energy to their govern|ment, and victory and triumph to their arms.</P>
<P>You will now, my hearers, &s;pontaneou&s;ly con|clude, that we have great rea&s;on to deplore the late death of General WASHINGTON, as a &s;evere frown of Heaven upon our ri&s;ing nation. He was unque&s;tionably the mo&s;t <HI>u&s;eful</HI> as well as mo&s;t <HI>illu&s;|trious</HI> man, of the pre&s;ent age. He early entered upon the theatre of public life, and &s;pent near fif|ty years in the &s;ervice of his country. In &s;uch a long cour&s;e of time, the important &s;tations which he filled, and the trying &s;cenes through which he pa&s;&s;ed, gave him ample opportunities of perform|ing the mo&s;t &s;ignal deeds of valor, of wi&s;dom, and of patrioti&s;m. Though our nation has produced many eminent men in the civil and military de|partments, as well as in every learned and unlearn|ed profe&s;&s;ion; yet America never produced any other man, who has been &s;o eminently and exten|&s;ively
<PB N="18" REF="037369_0016_100CD78AFB5FD828">
u&s;eful to his country and to the world, as WASHINGTON THE GREAT. It is hard to &s;ay, whether the &s;trength of his mind was &s;uperior to the ardor of his patrioti&s;m; or whether this was &s;u|perior to his &s;ucce&s;s in his country's &s;ervice. In the military department, he undoubtedly intended to &s;ave his nation from the &s;word of their enemies; and here he was completely &s;ucceeded. In the civil department, he undoubtedly intended to &s;ave his nation from anarchy and confu&s;ion; and here he was al&s;o completely &s;ucceeded. In every &s;it|uation, whether in the field or in the cabinet, or in his beloved &s;eat at Mount Vernon, he always had it in his heart, to &s;acrifice his <HI>per&s;onal</HI> intere&s;t to the <HI>national</HI> happine&s;s. This he di&s;covered by the re|peated and a&s;toni&s;hing in&s;tances of his <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> conduct. Though he jeoparded his life in the high places of the field, purely to defend the lives and liberties and fortunes of his countrymen; yet he would never accept of any pecuniary rewards for his military exertions, which it was in their wi&s;h|es or power to be&s;tow. Though he took the reins of government into his hands, in mere conde&s;cen|&s;ion to the unanimous voice of the nation; yet he utterly refu&s;ed to receive the legal emoluments of his arduous office. And though, after his retire|ment from public life, the people once more te&s;ti|fied their high e&s;timation of his per&s;onal merit, by
<PB N="19" REF="037369_0017_100CEE7563CB25A0">
offering him a gratuity for his great and noble &s;er|vices; yet his patriotic heart would not permit him to accept it, on any other condition, than that of devoting it wholly to public and beneficent u&s;es. How many men of di&s;tinction, in the late Ameri|can war, had the courage to perform noble and he|roic deeds; and yet, at the &s;ame time, had the meanne&s;s to make their private fortunes, by de|frauding the public? And how many famous &s;tate&s;men and heroes, in other nations, have fir&s;t gained the applau&s;e of their country, and then mer|ited the execration of the world, for their mean and mercenary motives? But it is the peculiar glory of Wa&s;hington, that his character will admit of no deduction. He never de&s;erted, he never de|frauded, he never oppre&s;&s;ed the people, whom he defended in war, and governed in peace. In&s;tead of putting his money, he put his character at inte|re&s;t. The noble, patriotic &s;pirit, which he uni|formly di&s;played, &s;pread a glory over all his public conduct, and had a greater influence, than all his wi&s;dom and valor, in uniting America and the world in his favor. His love to his country ef|fectually &s;ecured his country's love, which placed him in tho&s;e eminent &s;tations, in which he perform|ed &s;uch pre-eminent &s;ervices, as will embalm his memory, and perpetuate his fame, to the late&s;t gen|erations.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="037369_0018_100CEE778D3919F0">
But, alas! amid&s;t all his glory and u&s;efulne&s;s, God has been plea&s;ed to remove him, not only from our &s;ight, but from our help. "How is the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed!" The glory of our nation is departed. We have lo&s;t a large &s;hare of re&s;pectability in the eyes of Britain, in the eyes of France, and in the eyes of every nation, to which our flag has wafted the fame of Wa&s;hington. Di&s;tant nations have heretofore formed their opinions of America, from the great and amiable character of him, who defeated our enemies, and put us in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t per|fect freedom and independence. Whether, there|fore, they are friendly or unfriendly to our grow|ing country, they cannot view us in that exalted light, in which they were con&s;trained to view us, while we ju&s;tly claimed, as our own, the greate&s;t patriot, the greate&s;t general, the greate&s;t man, in the world.</P>
<P>But our national &s;trength, no le&s;s than our na|tional glory, is dimini&s;hed. How are the weapons of war peri&s;hed in the peri&s;hing hand of Wa&s;h|ington! Whil&s;t he lived to direct and animate our little band of warriors, they virtually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the martial &s;pirit and &s;trength of the United States. His &s;ingle voice could call as many fighting men into the field to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as the mo&s;t pre&s;|&s;ing
<PB N="21" REF="037369_0019_100CEE7A454C4AF0">
exigencies of the times could demand. This our foreign enemies believed, and kept their di&s;t|ance. This our internal enemies knew, and re|mained in &s;ilence and de&s;pair. But God has &s;een fit to take from us the <HI>mighty man</HI> and <HI>man of war,</HI> who was the ornament and defence of our coun|try, at a mo&s;t critical time, when the world are in arms, and every nation &s;eems to be &s;preading mi&s;|ery and de&s;truction to the utmo&s;t of their power. Though the armies of Europe have not invaded our country, yet the courts of Europe have em|ployed all their political arts to embarra&s;s our gov|ernment, divide our councils, and draw us into their de&s;tructive contentions. And how far they have &s;ucceeded, the melancholy event, which we this day deplore, may &s;erve to di&s;cover. The death of our renowned Chief may encourage, unite, and &s;trengthen all our national enemies. How far it may affect our pre&s;ent Emba&s;&s;y to France and the pre&s;ent oppo&s;ition to the admini&s;tration of govern|ment, we cannot determine, though we have cer|tainly much to fear. The decea&s;e of the Friend and Father of our country would have been, at any time, a public calamity; but at this dark and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing day, it is a peculiar frown of Heaven. God is now, therefore, loudly calling us to humil|iation and mourning. And though we may <HI>&s;ay and do too much,</HI> yet there is the utmo&s;t danger <HI>of our feel|ing
<PB N="22" REF="037369_0020_100CEE7D10E58408">
too little,</HI> under his correcting hand. The plain and &s;olemn language of his providence is, "Put not your tru&s;t in princes, nor in the &s;on of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts peri&s;h." Wa&s;hington is no more with re&s;pect to us, and it will be gro&s;s idolatry &s;till to confide in his tomb, or to depend upon any influ|ence of his in our favor, in the world of &s;pirits. His removal, at this peculiar time, we have rea&s;on to believe, was de&s;igned as a &s;olemn admonition to America, to renounce an undue dependence <HI>on an arm of fle&s;h,</HI> and to place their &s;upreme confidence <HI>in the Lord Jehovah, in whom there is everla&s;ting &s;trength.</HI> And what could have been better cal|culated to produce this de&s;irable effect? Is Wa&s;h|ington dead? His &s;ucce&s;&s;or in command may die. Is Wa&s;hington dead? The Pre&s;ident may die. Is Wa&s;hington dead? The wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t man in any department may die, and di&s;appoint the hopes of the court, of the army, of the navy, of all his fellow citizens. Death has lately made breach after breach in the congregation of the mighty. How many men of eminent wi&s;dom, integrity, and patrioti&s;m, who were the bulwarks of our land, have been followed to their tombs, by their weep|ing countrymen, in the cour&s;e of a very few
<PB N="23" REF="037369_0021_100CEE7EA3D416B0">
months! "Cea&s;e ye therefore from man, who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?"</P>
<P>God &s;eems to be coming out again&s;t us in the way of judgment, and it nearly concerns all ranks and orders of men, to prepare to meet him in the alarming di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence. By the death we are deploring, he is reading a &s;olemn lec|ture on the vanity and frailty of life, and teaching every one the ab&s;urdity, as well as criminality, of relying on any inherent quality or outward cir|cum&s;tance, to &s;hield him from the &s;troke of death. Let not the &s;trong man tru&s;t in his &s;trength; for Wa&s;hington the Mighty is dead. Let not the rich man tru&s;t in his wealth; for Wa&s;hington the Wealthy is dead. Let not the great man tru&s;t in his greatne&s;s; for Wa&s;hington the Great is dead. Let not the benevolent man tru&s;t in his benevo|lence and u&s;efulne&s;s; for Wa&s;hington the Father of his country and the Friend of man is dead. This &s;olemn in&s;tance of mortality, which has now a&s;|&s;embled the whole nation in the hou&s;es of God, and dre&s;&s;ed all cla&s;&s;es of citizens in the garments of mourning, loudly calls them to con&s;ider, that "they are this day going the way of all the earth." The time cannot be far di&s;tant, when they mu&s;t all de&s;cend to the grave, &s;tripped of their wealth, of
<PB N="24" REF="037369_0022_100CEE814DDA6EB8">
their ornaments, and of all their earthly di&s;tinctions, and lie as low in the du&s;t, as the man they lament.</P>
<P>But while we are contemplating the tomb of Wa&s;hington, and deploring the day of his death; let us not forget to rejoice at the day of his birth. That day was a &s;ignal mercy to America, which ought to be had in grateful and perpetual remem|brance. He was born neither too early, nor too late, for his own glory, or the public good. He came upon the &s;tage of life, at the very time, when the wide&s;t field of u&s;efulne&s;s was opened before him. He entered into that field, and &s;pent his days in performing the mo&s;t illu&s;trious and e&s;&s;en|tial &s;ervices for his native country. For the&s;e, we ju&s;tly owe him a large debt of public gratitude and re&s;pect, which is the only proper and adequate reward of eminent virtue and public u&s;efulne&s;s. We can ea&s;ily calculate the value of that time or &s;trength, which is employed for our per&s;onal bene|fit; but who can fully e&s;timate the worth of tho&s;e eminent virtues and talents, which are di&s;played in eminent &s;ervices for the public good? The path to every &s;pecies of eminence is extremely &s;teep and difficult. No man ever arrived at extraordi|nary u&s;efulne&s;s, without extraordinary exertions. It is as hard to comprehend the cares, the perils, the &s;elf-denying and arduous labors of tho&s;e, who
<PB N="25" REF="037369_0023_100CEE83E5387910">
guide the movements of armies, or direct the coun|cils of &s;tate; as it is to e&s;timate the great and nu|merous benefits, which may accrue to a nation, to a country, or to the world, in the cour&s;e of ages, from their great and noble efforts. Nothing, therefore, can fully di&s;charge our &s;trong and en|dearing obligations to the Father and Defender of our country, but the mo&s;t grateful emotions of heart, and the mo&s;t durable monuments of public re&s;pect. Let the&s;e be erected, and &s;acredly pre|&s;erved, as long as the name of Americans &s;hall be known in the earth But while we are faithful to the Fame of our illu&s;trious Benefactor, let us be wi&s;e to appreciate his great and amiable Example, which is really more valuable to each of his coun|trymen, than all his legacies, bequeathed to his friends. There is &s;omething in his illu&s;trious life, which comes home to the bu&s;ine&s;s and bo&s;om of every per&s;on, whether he acts in a public or private capacity. Let tho&s;e, who manage the affairs of government, imitate his wi&s;dom, integrity, patrio|ti&s;m, and invincible firmne&s;s. Let tho&s;e, who com|mand in the field, imitate his courage, fortitude, prudence, patience, &s;ecrecy, and &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Let tho&s;e, who live in wealth and affluence, imitate his private charity and public beneficence. Let tho&s;e, who are fond of &s;plendor and parade, ad|mire his Republican virtues, and imitate his &s;ub|lime
<PB N="26" REF="037369_0024_100CEE85730D2B08">
&s;implicity of manners. Let the wealthy and independent farmer follow his example of econo|my, indu&s;try, and per&s;everance in bu&s;ine&s;s. Let the aged imitate his decent gravity and perfect equanimity. Let the young de&s;pi&s;e the vanities, which he de&s;pi&s;ed; avoid the vices, which he a|voided; and practi&s;e tho&s;e &s;ober and manly vir|tues, which he practi&s;ed, in the morning of his days. In a word, let all cla&s;&s;es and de&s;criptions of men imitate that moderation, that public &s;pirit, and that tender concern for the good of all man|kind, which he &s;o eminently di&s;played in every part of his private and public life. Whoever wi&s;h|es to be eminently u&s;eful in any private employ|ment, or public &s;tation, let him think, and act, and live like Wa&s;hington. He never lo&s;t any time. He never pur&s;ued any trifles. He never neglect|ed any advantages. He never buried any talents. He never lived for him&s;elf, but for the univer&s;al benefit of his fellow men. This commanded their love and admiration, while he lived; and this throws them into mourning and &s;orrow, at his death. "How beautiful is &s;uch an example? how worthy of univer&s;al imitation?" Whoever follows it, &s;hall live univer&s;ally beloved, and die univer|&s;ally lamented.</P>
