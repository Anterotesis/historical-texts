<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>MURDER is a crime of &s;o atrocious a nature, and at the &s;ame time &s;o &s;eldom committed in the <HI>United States</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> that whenever it is perpe|trated, our &s;ouls &s;hudder at the depravity of human nature, and we become eager to find out the wretch, who &s;hould be &s;o &s;unk in villainy, as to imbrue his hands in innocent blood.</P>
<P>To this crime of &s;o deep a die, a proportionate &s;hare of puni&s;hment is annexed: murder and trea&s;on being now, according to the ameliorated laws of our &s;tate, the only felonies for which tho&s;e who are found guilty of them, can be condemned to &s;uffer an igno|minious death.</P>
<P>But if our minds revolt with horror, at the idea of murder, it unfortunately happens that this crime may frequently be committed in &s;uch a manner, as to ren|der it impracticable for us to obtain <HI>direct</HI> and <HI>po&s;itive</HI> proof again&s;t the guilty. Hence the verdict of a jury mu&s;t in such ca&s;es be entirely dependant on <HI>circum|&s;tantial evidence.</HI> The&s;e, however, ought to be re|ceived with the utmo&s;t caution; as circum&s;tances may appear exceedingly &s;trong again&s;t the &s;u&s;pected per&s;on, who may, notwith&s;tanding be perfectly innocent of the crime laid to his charge.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t, indeed, be little acquainted with the hi&s;to|ry of juri&s;diction in Great-Britain, Ireland, and the other nations of Europe, who does not know, that va|rious in&s;tances have occurred, in which juries, actuated by the pure&s;t, though no doubt, the mo&s;t mi&s;taken motives, have, by placing too much &s;tre&s;s on circum|&s;tantial
<PB N="iv" REF="037576_0003_10111B7B033D3940">
proof a&s;&s;igned to unde&s;erved puni&s;hment, per|&s;ons, who, in con&s;equence of their verdict, have, after &s;uffering an ignominious death, been fairly and po&s;i|tively proved to have had no &s;hare in the crimes for which they have &s;uffered.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t intelligence of a murder being com|mitted, &s;u&s;picion will naturally be attached to &s;omebo|dy&mdash;The rumour again&s;t the unfortunate man, whe|ther innocent or guilty, is propagated with unremitting a&s;&s;iduity, either by tho&s;e, who entertain &s;ome animo|&s;ity again&s;t him, or by credulous per&s;ons, who greedi|ly &s;wallowing what they hear, are eager to di&s;&s;eminate their opinions as widely as po&s;&s;ible. Thus the tale goes round, daily accumulating further &s;trength, till at la&s;t a prejudice, which at fir&s;t might only have influ|enced the minds of a few individuals, becomes popu|lar, a mole-hill becomes a mountain&mdash;and the unfor|tunate victim become the object of horror and indigna|tion to the unthinking multitude, who, if it were not for the ju&s;t rigour of the laws, would make him, with out judge or jury, a &s;acrifice to their own wild and di&s;tracted imaginations.</P>
<P>The above remarks could never, perhaps, with more propriety have been applied to any particular ca&s;e, than that of Mr. LEVI WEEKS, a young gen|tleman of re&s;pectable character, again&s;t whom, at the la&s;t court of <HI>Oyer and Terminer, and general Gaol-de|livery,</HI> a bill of indictment was found, for the Mur|der of Mi&s;s JULIANNA ELMORE SANDS.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of his guilt appeared at fir&s;t, ve|ry trivial. They were however, afterwards, either by the malicious and &s;tudied de&s;igns of his enemies, or what is more probable, by that prepen&s;ity which thoughtle&s;s people generally exerci&s;e, in propagating &s;lander, without, perhaps, having any particular de|&s;ign in view, augmented to &s;uch a degree, as in a great mea&s;ure, to render him the object of univer&s;al abhor|rence. Tho&s;e who dared to &s;uppo&s;e him innocent,
<PB N="v" REF="037576_0004_10111B85664DEC68">
were very generally con&s;idered as partakers in his guilt. Tale after tale, &s;ucceeded to irritate the pub|lic mind. Hand-bills were &s;oon after his fir&s;t con|finement, generally di&s;tributed throughout the city, ei|ther by the indu&s;try of tho&s;e bent upon his de&s;truc|tion; or, perhaps, by &s;ome unprincipled &s;cribbler, who, regardle&s;s of the effect, which his productions might have upon the weak part of the community, could conjure up thou&s;ands of gho&s;ts and goblins <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have &s;een hand-bills, announcing the appearance of dancing devils: a gho&s;t in the debtors' apartment: various accounts of witch|craft, &s;trange and wonderful prophecies, &amp;c. &amp;c. On due examina|tion, where are tho&s;e &s;upernatural appearances to be found? Shall we never learn wi&s;dom, or mu&s;t we ever be the dupes of impo&s;ture?</NOTE> at the Manhattan Well, for the &s;ake of rai&s;ing a few pence to purcha&s;e a dinner.</P>
<P>Happy, thrice happy the people, who entertaining true notions of rational liberty, whil&s;t, on the one hand, they are ready to bring <HI>real</HI> criminals to that puni&s;h|ment, which the laws of the land inflict on their de|merits, are on the other, bound by the ties of the &s;ocial compact, never to condemn a man without a hearing &mdash;nor to &s;uppo&s;e him guilty, till his crime &s;hall be proved again&s;t him, in a court of ju&s;tice&mdash;</P>
<P>An impartial court, compo&s;ed of &s;uch wi&s;e and up|right magi&s;trates, as at pre&s;ent adorn our bench; and a jury of &s;uch citizens as ever have, and I tru&s;t, ever will compo&s;e the jurors of the city of New-York, will, no doubt, on all occa&s;ions, endeavor to dive&s;t them&s;elves of <HI>that bias which popular rumours may have in&s;tilled into their minds, again&s;t the accu&s;ed;</HI> examine the te&s;|timony, which may be brought before them, with calmne&s;s, coolne&s;s, and deliberation, and without pre|ju&s;tice, favor, or affection, pronounce the innocence or guilt of the pri&s;oners who may be brought before them.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of MR. LEVI WEEKS, who was brought to the bar on Monday the 31&s;t of March la&s;t, the
<PB N="vi" REF="037576_0005_10111B86EB8F9898">
attention of the public was in general attracted, though his name had been very generally marked with unde&s;erved obloquy, &s;ince the middle of the preceding January, and many had been taught to believe, that the charges to be adduced again&s;t him would not only be of the mo&s;t &s;erious nature, but al&s;o that no excul|patory proof could po&s;&s;ibly appear in his favour, yet we find that after the mo&s;t lengthy, and impartial trial which perhaps was ever held in the city of New-York, the jury, after having withdrawn for the &s;hort &s;pace of <HI>about four minutes,</HI> pronounced him <HI>innocent,</HI> and the &s;urrounding multitudes, who, a few days before, were crying out <HI>crucify him, crucify him,</HI> began in a manner unknown in our courts of ju&s;tice, to expre&s;s their approbation by loud applau&s;es. Such is the benefit of impartial courts and juries, from who&s;e deci&s;ion re&s;ulted this TRIUMPH OF INNO|CENCE.</P>
<P>It need &s;carcely be premi&s;ed, that the ca&s;e of a young man who is a native of this place, and who had, therefore, been <HI>univer&s;ally beloved by the mo&s;t re&s;pec|table inhabitants of New York, for his probity, in|du&s;try, temperance, &s;uavity of di&s;po&s;ition, gentility of manners, &amp;c. in &s;hort, for a di&s;play of all tho&s;e virtues, which are mo&s;t ornamental in the human character,</HI> when accu&s;ed of &s;o heinous a crime, as that of murder, would attract a large &s;hare of the pub|lic attention: particularly, when it is con&s;idered, that the reports concerning him were &s;o numerous and contradictory as to leave no place whereon the im|partial mind wearied in endeavouring to inve&s;tigate the truth, could find a re&s;t.</P>
<P>Accordingly, when the trial came on, the concour&s;e of people was &s;o great, as was never before witne&s;&s;ed on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion in New-York. Indeed, it is probable, that though the room in which the court was held is very large, not one fourth of tho&s;e who attended could procure admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the evening previous to the trial, I had ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="vii" REF="037576_0006_10111B096F3AC648">
to a few friends my intention of going to the Federal Hall, on the en&s;uing day, and waiting its re|&s;ult. They &s;ugge&s;ted the idea, that the public were gaping with eager anxiety for the i&s;&s;ue, and that an account of it would no doubt be very generally ac|ceptable.</P>
<P>Not being acquainted with the art of &s;tenography, I am incapable of giving verbatim what was &s;aid up|on this &s;olemn and awful occa&s;ion. Indeed if I were, I &s;hould, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, think it proper to give only a cur&s;ory &s;ketch.</P>
<P>The prejudices re&s;pecting him, who was &s;o lately a pri&s;oner, but who is now &s;o honorably cleared, have been di&s;&s;eminated far and wide. The &s;ooner this can be announced to the public the better, &s;o that all fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ions may be done away.</P>
<P>The va&s;t concour&s;e of people, which upon this oc|ca&s;ion, not only crouded the outer hall, but even the bar it&s;elf, prevented me from taking my notes with that accuracy, which I could have wi&s;hed. I believe, however, that from what I wrote on the occa&s;ion, and what my memory can &s;upply, the following &s;ketch may be deemed, with re&s;pect to the mo&s;t important points, authentic.</P>

<HEAD>THE TRIAL.</HEAD>
<P>SEVERAL of the jury &s;ummoned on this occa&s;ion, were objected to by the pri&s;oner; but the following gentlemen were at la&s;t impannelled:</P>
<P><HI>Garret Strong, Simon Schermerhorn, Robert Lil|burn, George Scriba, Wm. G. Miller, Richard Ellis, James Hunt, Samuel Ward, John Rathbone, Wm. Wharton, jun. Wm. Wil&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Ja&s;per Ward.</HI></P>
<P>The indictment being read, the purport of which was, that on the evening of the 22d December, about 8 o'clock, he had taken from the place of her re&s;idence Mi&s;s JULIANNA E. SANDS, that after beating, abu&s;|ing, &amp;c. the body of the &s;aid ELMORE, he had thrown her into a well belonging to the Manhattan company, near Bayard's Lane, which contained a great quantity of water, and that he had been the means of killing or murdering the &s;aid ELMORE&mdash;To which Mr. WEEKS pleaded <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>The judges, upon this occa&s;ion, were Judge Lan|&s;ing, Richard Varick, E&s;qr. Mayor, and Richard Harri&s;on, E&s;q. Recorder.</P>
<P>Richard Furman and Robert Lenox, E&s;qrs. Alder|men, likewi&s;e attended during a great part of the trial.</P>
<P>The Council on behalf of the &s;tate, was, Mr. Col|den, a&s;&s;i&s;tant Attorney-General&mdash;and on the part of Mr. WEEKS, Gen. Alexander Hamilton, Col. Burr, Brockhol&s;t Living&s;ton, Abraham Skinner, James Woods, Charles Baldwin, and Francis Lynch, E&s;qrs.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s was opened by an elegant addre&s;s from Mr. Colden, in which, after paying a hand&s;ome com|pliment
<PB N="10" REF="037576_0008_10111B8A1A53DE40">
to the talents of the attornies for Mr. WEEKS, and noticing that influence which they might acquire by the force of oratory, he ob&s;erved, that if from the ma&s;s of evidence, he &s;hould adduce, he could draw truth, he would, in that ca&s;e, fully di&s;charge the duty of a public pro&s;ecutor.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the per&s;on, who now &s;tands as a pri|&s;oner at the bar, it was certainly much in his favour, that he had heretofore been univer&s;ally con&s;idered as a young man of unblemi&s;hed character, and irreproach|able morals; and that indeed, the crime of which he was accu&s;ed, was of &s;uch a horrid nature, as &s;carcely to make it po&s;&s;ible that he could have committed it; and that when all circum&s;tances were con&s;idered, it could &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;ed, that human nature was ca|pable of &s;uch a crime.</P>
<P>He, however, on the other hand, &s;tated, that not|with&s;tanding the&s;e favourable appearances, he could ad|duce proofs, that Mr. LEVI WEEKS had &s;educed the affections of the decea&s;ed Mi&s;s E. SANDS that he had promi&s;ed her marriage; taken her in a &s;leigh, on the evening of the day mentioned in the indictment, carri|ed her to the fatal &s;pot and murdered her.</P>
<P>This was the general purport of the attorney gene|ral's adddre&s;s. He, however, conde&s;cended, on a number of particulars, which, though no doubt nece&s;|&s;ary in a court of ju&s;tice, is incompatible with the bre|vity contemplated in the pre&s;ent &s;ketch.</P>
<P>He concluded by ob&s;erving, that whether Mr. WEEKS was guilty of the crime laid to his charge or not, it was certain, that a mo&s;t inhuman murder had been committed by &s;ome one on the body of the de|cea&s;ed: that the nature of the te&s;timony could, in &s;uch a ca&s;e as the pre&s;ent, be only circum&s;tantial; but that a chain of circum&s;tances, &s;upported by a number of witne&s;&s;es, &s;hould often be more conclu&s;ive with a Jury than a direct proof&mdash;ina&s;much, that in the latter ca&s;e, there might be perjury, whereas in the former no
<PB N="11" REF="037576_0009_10111B0CA144E438">
&s;uch thing could be &s;u&s;pected. He added, that as the trial would undoubtedly be long, and the witne&s;&s;es on the part of the people numerous, he would now pro|ceed.</P>
<P>[&rindx; And here I would ob&s;erve, before I enter up|on the evidence on either &s;ide, that it is not my inten|tion to give even a DETAIL of ALL the different te&s;timonies. Many of them appeared to have no &s;ort of connection with the point in que&s;tion. Indeed the learned Judge, in &s;umming up the evidence at the con|clu&s;ion of the trial, &s;poke to the following purpo&s;e&mdash; That in the great ma&s;s of evidence before them, there was a con&s;iderable portion, which would &s;eem to di&s;|grace the records of a Court.&mdash;Nothing, therefore, &s;hall appear here, except what is more immediately connected with the &s;ubject.]</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, and perhaps the mo&s;t material evidence on the part of the people, was Mrs. Ring, who <HI>affirmed,</HI> that in the month of July la&s;t, Levi Weeks came to board in her hu&s;band's hou&s;e and was &s;oon after ob&s;erved to pay particular attention to Elmore Sands, who had lived with them as one of their family for the la&s;t three years: that about the 10th or 11th September, being apprehen&s;ive of the fever &s;he went to the country and was de&s;irous of ta|king Elmore along with her, who was, however, un|willing, and that &s;he therefore remained at home. That about four weeks after her departure &s;he receiv|ed a letter from her hu&s;band advi&s;ing her to return home, with which &s;he &s;oon after complied, and re|turned accordingly. That Elmore being taken un|well, Mr. Weeks was very a&s;&s;iduous in his attention towards her; &s;at by her bed, expre&s;&s;ed great unea&s;ine&s;s at her affliction, and wi&s;hed to call a phy&s;ician; that about the end of November or 1&s;t of December, El|more u&s;ually &s;lept in her own room; and that going up about twelve o'clock one night, &s;he found Mr. Weeks &s;itting by the bed-&s;ide with his cloaths on&punc; and
<PB N="12" REF="037576_0010_10111ADFB1A11FB8">
that the door was &s;hut again&s;t her. (Here Mr. Ring, the hu&s;band of this evidence, was ordered to leave the court, during the time his wife was giving evidence.) That the deponent a&s;ked Mr. Weeks what was meant by the door being &s;hut again&s;t her; to which he an|&s;wered that he did not know that it was &s;he, upon which the witne&s;s a&s;ked, why the door was &s;hut at all, to which M. Weeks replied, that as Elmore was &s;ick, he was afraid to tru&s;t her with any other per&s;on for fear of neglect. That at another time when the decea&s;ed was unwell, Mr. Weeks was found &s;itting by her bed &s;ide, that they were often found together, and alone in different parts of the hou&s;e, and that every day gave corroborations to prove that Mr. Weeks inten|ded to marry her. That on the morning of the 22d of Dec. Mr. Weeks went out immediately after break|fa&s;t, &s;aying he was going over to his brother's. When he returned &s;ome time after he &s;aid he had hurt his knee: upon which one ob&s;erved that he would not be able to go out that day. He &s;aid, he would be able at night. After Elmore had dre&s;&s;ed his knee he went up &s;tairs accompanied by her, where they re|mained more than an hour; that &s;ome time after eleven o'clock he came down &s;tairs and was &s;oon after followed by her. That a little before night Mr. Weeks and Elmore were in the dining room together, from whence they &s;oon after went up &s;tairs and &s;taid about half an hour. That about dark Elmore had dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf as neatly as &s;he po&s;&s;ibly could; and that as it was cold and &s;he was to go out that evening, &s;he borrowed a muff from a neighbour: that Mr. Weeks came in a little before eight; and that when the clock &s;truck eight, her hu&s;band, the decea&s;ed and Mr. Weeks were &s;itting together; that the witne&s;s then adju&s;ted Elmore's &s;hawl, which was crooked, and that &s;he had the muff in her hand: that Mr. Weeks then went to the door with his hat in his hand; that Elmore was then up &s;tairs, all ready to come down:
<PB N="13" REF="037576_0011_10111B12C791B2C8">
that immediately after, the door being opened, &s;he heard a per&s;on come down &s;tairs, and that there was a whi&s;pering by the door, which was in&s;tantly &s;hut: that &s;he was a good deal agitated upon this occa&s;ion, and that the &s;uppo&s;ed going out of the two attracted the attention of her hu&s;band: that &s;he did not &s;ee Mr. WEEKS again till ten o'clock, when William Ander|&s;on, his apprentice, was waiting for the key to go to bed: that he then came to the fire and gave the key to the apprentice, de&s;iring him to go to bed, and that he appeared to be agitated, and his countenance pale: that he a&s;ked whether Hope, the &s;i&s;ter of this depo|nent, who had gone out in the morning, had returned, to which &s;he an&s;wered, No: that he then a&s;ked whe|ther Elmore had gone to bed, to which &s;he an&s;wered, that &s;he had gone out: that he then expre&s;&s;ed his &s;ur|pri&s;e that &s;he &s;hould go out alone at &s;o late an hour, to which the witne&s;s an&s;wered, that &s;he had no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he had gone out alone, to which he made no reply: and that Mr. Weeks went to bed in about half an hour after he came in, and that he was apparently much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed: That under the expecta|tion of the return of Elmore, &s;he had &s;at up till about twelve o'clock, at which time &s;he &s;earched the hou&s;e, and not finding her, went to bed, leaving the door un|locked. On Monday the 23d, Mr. Weeks along with the other boarders breakfa&s;ted as u&s;ual, and that a lit|tle after Mr. Weeks went out: that &s;he then heard &s;ome per&s;on go &s;oftly up &s;tairs, whom &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed to be Elmore: that Mr. Weeks then came into the room and a&s;ked concerning Elmore, to which the deponent an&s;wered, that &s;he had not &s;een her: that he then ex|pre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize where &s;he &s;hould be, to which &s;he an&s;wered, that perhaps &s;he might be up&s;tairs; and that the deponent being nettled at his que&s;tions, farther ob&s;erved, that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he knew be&s;t where &s;he was, upon which he went up &s;tairs, and upon coming down &s;aid &s;he was not there: that the witne&s;s not be|lieving
<PB N="14" REF="037576_0012_10111B8BA63AC228">
him went up &s;tairs her&s;elf, and found that what he had &s;aid was true&punc; that about fifteen minutes after he came again, making enquiry about Elmore, and expre&s;&s;ing his &s;urprize where &s;he could be, to which the witne&s;s an&s;wered, that &s;he had rea&s;on to believe &s;he had gone out with him, to which he replied, that he had not &s;een her &s;ince the time &s;he left the room the preceding evening, on which he appeared much con|cerned: that about twelve o'clock, upon ob&s;erving to Mr. Weeks that &s;he had been fifty times at the door looking for Elmore, he replied, that he had looked of|tener than that him&s;elf: that on the next morning the 24th December, after breakfa&s;t, Mr. Weeks perceiv|ing her (the witne&s;s) to be exceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, took hold of her arm, &s;aying, "Don't be unea&s;y; things may turn out better than you expect." That on the afternoon of the &s;ame day, the witne&s;s told Mr. Weeks, that matters had now become exceedingly &s;e|rious, and that &s;he could &s;tand it no longer; that &s;he a&s;ked him what had become of her, at the &s;ame time ob&s;erving, that if it had not been for the unlimited con|fidence which &s;he entertained of him, &s;he would have been much more unhappy than &s;he now was; and he then expre&s;&s;ed great &s;orrow at the deponent's di&s;tre&s;s: That in a farther conver&s;ation upon this &s;ubject, the deponent had mentioned to Mr. Weeks, that Elmore previous to her going out had mentioned to her, that &s;he was to be married to him that evening at 8 o'clock; upon which he appeared to be much agitated, and be|gan to cry, &s;aying, that he was ruined and undone, un|le&s;s &s;he appeared to clear him, and that he would ra|ther die than live under it: That on the Thur&s;day fol|lowing Mr. Weeks came in about &s;even o'clock P. M. at which time the witne&s;s being much afflicted, &s;aid, &s;he was &s;ure that he had got her, and begged he would tell the truth; to which he replied, "It is my firm belief &s;he is now in eternity. It really is." That upon be|ing a&s;ked what made him &s;ay &s;o, he an&s;wered, "that
<PB N="15" REF="037576_0013_10111B9359C6C910">
he had frequently heard her &s;ay, &s;he wi&s;hed that &s;he had never been in exi&s;tence." The witne&s;s, upon be|ing que&s;tioned with re&s;pect to the di&s;po&s;ition of the de|cea&s;ed, replied, that &s;he was exceedingly lively, and that the evening &s;he la&s;t went out, &s;he appeared more chearful than u&s;ual: that on Thur&s;day the muff was found in the Manhattan well. Being que&s;tioned con|cerning the character of Mr. Weeks, &s;he replied, that he was a kind, friendly, and &s;ober young man, and al|ways very &s;ociable in the family. The witne&s;s being que&s;tioned, whether &s;he had ever enquired of Mr. Weeks, about his being engaged to Elmore, replied, that &s;he never had, till the Tue&s;day after her di&s;ap|pearance. On being a&s;ked whether &s;he did not know of the decea&s;ed being intimate with any other per&s;on be&s;ides Mr. Weeks, &s;he an&s;wered, No. Whether there was rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect any improper conduct be|tween her husband and Mi&s;s Sands, &s;he replied, not in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Hope Sands, &s;i&s;ter of the la&s;t witne&s;s, <HI>affirmed</HI>&mdash; That &s;he had once found Mr. Weeks and the decea&s;|ed locked up in a room together; but did not know what pa&s;&s;ed between them: That upon her a&s;king him on Monday, the 23d Dec. whether he knew where Elmore was, he replied, he did not. On being que&s;|tioned with re&s;pect to Mr. Weeks' general character, &s;he replied, that he was loved by all the family, but that his attachment appeared to be more particularly fixed upon Elmore than any other per&s;on.</P>
<P>Elias Ring, <HI>affirmed</HI>&mdash;That during his wife's ab|&s;ence in the country, from the tenth or eleventh of September, till about &s;ix weeks thereafter, Mr. Weeks and the decea&s;ed were frequently alone together in dif|ferent parts of the hou&s;e; that one night, believing them to have been in bed together, he next morning went to Mr. Weeks' room, found the bed greatly tumbled, and the clothes, which Elmore had worn the preceding evening, lying in the room. On being

a&s;ked whether he had ever &s;aid, that Mr. Weeks was engaged to Elmore, he replied, that probably he might &mdash;He likewi&s;e depo&s;ed, that Mr. Weeks was much more attentive to Elmore, than he was to Hope Sands, or Mary Clark, both of whom were unmarried wo|men living in the hou&s;e: That Elmore was a girl of a lovely di&s;po&s;ition, and decent character, and that he was not at fir&s;t unea&s;y on account of her di&s;appear|ance, becau&s;e he thought that Mr. Weeks, in whom he repo&s;ed the greate&s;t confidence, was along with her. That upon the twenty-&s;ixth of Dec. Mr. Weeks, af|ter taking him, (this deponent) up &s;tairs, had enquired whether he had &s;aid any thing about his, (Mr. Weeks') knowing any thing about Elmore, to which he, (the deponent) an&s;wered, that he had, and that he verily believed he knew all about her. On being a&s;ked, whe|ther he had ever &s;aid, that if he could do it privately, he would kill Mr. Weeks, he replied, that he had ne|ver even thought of &s;uch a thing.</P>
<P>Margaret Clark being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed that &s;he had lived in Mr. Ring's hou&s;e, in the capacity of &s;ervant &s;ome time before Mr. Weeks had come to re&s;ide there as a boarder; but that &s;he was not there during the time that Mrs. Ring was in the country, that &s;he knew that Mr. Weeks and the decea&s;ed had been in bed together the Monday before her di&s;appearance, but that &s;he did not believe, that Mr. Weeks had engaged to marry her. That he was always very at|tentive to any one in the family who might be &s;ick; but not more &s;o to the decea&s;ed, than to any other per&s;on. That the decea&s;ed was an active and lively girl, and that during the conver&s;ation, which at any time had pa&s;&s;ed between them, &s;he had never &s;aid, that &s;he was engaged to marry Mr. Weeks.</P>
<P>I&s;aac Hatfield being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> &s;aid that he had gone to lodge in Mr. Ring's hou&s;e about the 14th or 15th of September, where he continued four or five weeks, during which time he ob&s;erved a great intimacy to

&s;ub&s;i&s;t between Mr. Weeks and the decea&s;ed, who &s;eemed to be exceedingly fond of each other: that when he left the hou&s;e, there was no boarder there except Mr. Weeks; being a&s;ked with re&s;pect to the di&s;po&s;ition of the decea&s;ed, he &s;aid, that &s;he appeared to him to be a very lively and chearful girl.</P>
<P>Mr. Croucher being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed that he had lodged in the hou&s;e from the 2nd week in September, during which time he had ob&s;erved great intimacy between Mr. Weeks and the decea&s;ed; and that he had never ob&s;erved any court&s;hip to be more warm; that for two nights, the decea&s;ed had been a great while in Mr. Week's bed-room, and that one evening, the door being left unguardedly open, he had &s;een them engaged in an indecent act: Upon being a&s;ked wheth|er he had any difference with Mr. Weeks, he an&s;wer|ed that he once had, and in con&s;equence of that difference, he had called Mr. Weeks an impertinent puppy; that the evening on which the decea&s;ed was mi&s;&s;ing he had been at a hou&s;e in the Bowery, from which he returned about half pa&s;t eleven o'clock, an hour later than u&s;ual, as he had engaged with Mr. Ring always to be at home by ten o'clock; that he had never been on bad terms with the decea&s;ed, ex|cept that there was &s;ome dryne&s;s between them for a while, in con&s;equence of his difference with Mr. Weeks: that on the night of Sunday, the 22d Dec. on Monday night, and every night thereafter as long as Mr. Weeks continued there, he had been di&s;turbed by a noi&s;e in Mr. Week's room, &amp;c. On being a&s;ked whether he had pa&s;&s;ed near the Manhattan well the night of the 22d, he an&s;wered that he had not; he further ob&s;erved, that the night was cloudy and walking very bad.</P>
<P>Henry Ronalds having <HI>affirmed,</HI> &s;aid, that he had been acquainted with the decea&s;ed from her infancy, concerning whom he never knew any thing unbeco|ming

<P>John Ben&s;on having <HI>affirmed,</HI> &s;aid, that he had re|&s;ided in the hou&s;e of Mr. Ring for &s;ome days, in the month of September la&s;t, during which time he had perceived nothing extraordinary in the conduct of the decea&s;ed, or Mr. Weeks. He added that the decea&s;|ed was a lively and active girl.</P>
<P>Su&s;annah Broad, an aged woman, being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> de|po&s;ed, that &s;he lived in the vicinity of the hou&s;e of Mr. Ezra Weeks, and that about eight o'clock, on a Sunday evening, &s;he heard the gate open, which made her believe that &s;omebody was &s;tealing: that a &s;leigh or chai&s;e had been brought out, &s;he knew not which, and that about twelve days after the body of the de|cea&s;ed was found. That &s;he had never before nor &s;ince, heard a &s;leigh or carriage go out from that gate.&mdash; On being cro&s;s-examined, &s;he &s;eemed quite indeci&s;ive with re&s;pect to the &s;leigh going out, and gave no &s;atis|factory an&s;wers with re&s;pect to other circum&s;tances, concerning which &s;he was que&s;tioned. Chief Ju&s;tice Lan&s;ing, in &s;umming up the evidence, mentioned her te&s;timony as being entitled to no con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Several evidences were now brought to prove, that on the evening of the 22d December, a one hor&s;e &s;leigh, without bells, had been met driving down the middle road, at a great rate, containing, as &s;ome of them &s;aid, a man and a woman, and others, two men and a woman: that on Monday the track of a one hor&s;e &s;leigh had been ob&s;erved near the Manhattan Well, and that, on the preceding evening, cries of the mo&s;t extreme di&s;tre&s;s were heard. As, however, there did not appear the &s;malle&s;t &s;hadow of evidence, that Mr. Weeks had any &s;hare in the&s;e tran&s;actions, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to detail them.</P>
<P>Dr. Skinner being duly <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed, that he had vi&s;ited the body of the decea&s;ed, after it had been taken out of the well, both in the hou&s;e of Mr. Ring,

<P>James W.

The witne&s;s being a&s;ked whether a corp&s;e might a&s;&s;ume a livid appearance by expo&s;ure to the air or cold, replied, he believed not&mdash;Being que&s;tioned, whe|ther &s;uch an appearance might not be occa&s;ioned by &s;uffocation, he an&s;wered, that he was not certain.</P>
<P>Dr. David Ho&s;&s;ack having <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed, that he had &s;een the body of the decea&s;ed, and had ob&s;erved three or four &s;pots on the neck, and that her forehead was brui&s;ed: both of which he con&s;i|dered to be the effect of violence from &s;ome other per&s;on than her&s;elf, and that in his opinion, &s;he could by no act of her own, have inflicted &s;uch wounds on her&s;elf as appeared on his examination of the body.</P>
<P>Mrs. O&s;born, being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed that the de|cea&s;ed Mi&s;s Sands, with whom &s;he was well acquainted, was a lively girl, received the muff, which was after|wards found in the Manhattan well from Mrs. Blonk.</P>
<P>William Williams being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed that he had rode from the hou&s;e of Mr. Ring with a hor&s;e to the Manhattan well in &s;ixteen minutes, and at another in fifteen, that he was then only on a trott and hat very probably it might have been done in le&s;s time.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="037576_0019_100EDEE3075DBA18">Mr. Bu&s;kirk being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed exactly to the &s;ame purpo&s;e as the evidence immediately preceding.</P>

<P>The evidence being now clo&s;ed on the part of the people, colonel Burr addre&s;&s;ed the court and jury in one of the mo&s;t eloquent &s;peeches, which we have ever heard. His eloquence was however, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary, as the guilt a&s;cribed to Mr. Weeks, appeared to every per&s;on pre&s;ent upon the trial to have been un&s;upported by any &s;ub&s;tantial evidence.</P>
<P>Colonel Burr then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in behalf of the pri&s;oner to the court and jury, in one of the mo&s;t ma&s;terly &s;peeches both with re&s;pect to compo&s;ition and oratory, which we have ever heard, the purport of which is as follows.</P>
<P>He began by taking notice of the great calmne&s;s, with which the jury had li&s;tened to the &s;ubject in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion for many hours. He ob&s;erved, that in criminal ca&s;es, it was e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for a jury who did not wi&s;h to be hereafter tortured with remor&s;e of con&s;cience that circum&s;tantial evidence was, in general, improper, and ought in no ca&s;e whatever, to be relied on, unle&s;s that they were uniformly and completely connected together in one regular chain. He &s;poke of the influence which prejudice might have upon the imaginations, as tending in &s;uch ca&s;es to prevent a wi&s;e and ju&s;t deci&s;ion: that in a court of ju&s;tice, if there were any bia&s;s it ought rather to be in the favour of the pri&s;oner's innocence, than of his guilt, and at all events, every man &s;hould be deemed innocent of the crime laid to his charge, 'till he was proved guilty: that tales of every &s;pecies had been <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">gated again&s;t the pri&s;oner, which had left the
<PB N="22" REF="037576_0020_100EDF1007B0EEE0">
mo&s;t unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion upon the public mind. That with re&s;pect to the&s;e it was e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the jury to fortify them&s;elves, in order to their fixing upon a ju&s;t and proper verdict; and that he was per&s;uaded, that if the whole evidence aqain&s;t Mr. Weeks was fairly and impartially examined, there was not a &s;ingle circum&s;tance on the face of the te&s;timony, which could influence a jury to pronounce the pri&s;on|er guilty.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved, that, notwith&s;tanding the intimacy, which was &s;aid to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the pri&s;oner and the decea&s;ed, it did not amount to court&s;hip, or a well-founded expectation of a future marriage; and that his attention to her appeared by no means to indi|cate any &s;uch views: that the decea&s;ed had manife&s;ted equal partiality for other per&s;ons, as for Mr. Weeks: and that &s;he was frequently in the habit of going out late at night, and that in her apologies for &s;uch con|duct, it would be found, that &s;he had a&s;&s;erted, that &s;he had &s;pent her time in hou&s;es, where it afterwards appeared &s;he had not been:&mdash;and that hence it might fairly be concluded, that if the conduct of the decea&s;ed had not been irregular, it at lea&s;t had been very indi&s;creet, and might have expo|&s;ed her to danger, both with re&s;pect to her morals and per&s;on; and that if &s;he really had been murdered, the &s;u&s;picion might, with more propriety be attached to &s;ome other per&s;on than to Mr. Weeks. That it would appear, on the evidence, which would hereafter be produced, in what manner the pri&s;oneer was em|ployed on the evening of the 22d Dec.: from which it would be evident, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly have had any &s;hare in throwing the decea&s;ed into the Man|hattan Well&mdash;and that about half pa&s;t 8 o'clock, be|ing nearly the time at which the unfortunate tran&s;ac|tion was &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened, he was at the hou&s;e of his brother, where he &s;upped, and &s;at till ten o'clock, in a calm, compo&s;ed, and cheerful manner, as
<PB N="23" REF="037576_0021_100EDEE526DB4400">
u&s;ual, and without di&s;covering the lea&s;t perturbation of mind.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved, that before a jury could be ju&s;tified in bringing a verdict again&s;t a pri&s;oner, upon circum|&s;tantial evidences, circum&s;tances upon which they were to found their opinion, mu&s;t be clo&s;ely connected together, and that there mu&s;t be no breach in the chain &mdash;but that the old woman's depo&s;ition, with re&s;pect to the &s;tory of the &s;leigh, was &s;o exceedingly defective, that it did not de&s;erve the &s;malle&s;t attention&mdash;that &s;he was obviou&s;ly lo&s;t in recollection, with re&s;pect to dates and time.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved, that on this occa&s;ion, the utmo&s;t in|du&s;try and ingenuity had been exerci&s;ed, to irritate the public mind again&s;t the pri&s;oner&mdash;that upon ob|&s;erving every circum&s;tance, he could have no motive in perpetrating &s;o horrid a deed: that there could be no love connected with jealou&s;y&mdash;that he could not po&s;&s;ibly have harboured any re&s;entment&mdash;which was more than could be &s;aid with re&s;pect to &s;ome others, who were her acquaintances, and who&s;e intere&s;t it might be greater to have de&s;troyed the decea&s;ed, than Mr. Weeks.</P>
<P>He then proceeded to &s;tate, that Mr. Weeks was a young man highly e&s;teemed by many of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable inhabitants of New-York; that there could not po&s;&s;ibly be any good ground for &s;u&s;pecting that he was the murderer of the decea&s;ed; that con|&s;idering every circum&s;tance, viewing his general character and appreciating any motive, by which it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, he could po&s;&s;ibly be actuated, he could not be guilty.</P>
<P>That there was nothing extraordinary in the cir|cum&s;tance of his being appalled, when taxed with the charge of murder, as this might be produced at the a&s;toni&s;hment of the charge, or re&s;entment again&s;t the per&s;ons who dared to harbour &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>He warned the jury again&s;t paying attention to popular rumours and mentioned two ca&s;es&punc; in which
<PB N="24" REF="037576_0022_100EDF11F169BFF0">
per&s;ons after having been generally &s;uppo&s;ed guilty of the crimes alledged again&s;t them, were afterwards found innocent.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was with re&s;pect to a man who was indict|ed for having murdered a young woman. Although entirely innocent of the crime laid to his charge, he got affrightened and in order, as he hoped, to &s;ave him&s;elf from the agony of death, upon the gibbet, got another woman to repre&s;ent the per&s;on who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be mi&s;&s;ing&mdash;the fraud was di&s;covered and this connected with other circum&s;tances induced the jury to bring their verdict <HI>guilty.</HI> The man was hanged; but the woman &s;uppo&s;ed to be murdered, afterwards made her appearance, by which every per|&s;on was convinced that the jury had been mi&s;taken in their verdict.</P>
<P>The &s;econd ca&s;e which he mentioned was re&s;pect|ing a rape &s;uppo&s;ed to be committed, &s;ome few years ago upon a young woman of this city, the circum|&s;tances of which mu&s;t be fre&s;h in the memory of mo&s;t people: the public mind was in that ca&s;e greatly in|cen&s;ed, and notwith&s;tanding the verdict of a jury declaring the pre&s;oner not guilty, the irritation of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> minds was &s;o great as to induce them to in&s;ult the magi&s;trates and to pull down the hou&s;e of a per|&s;on who was believed to be aiding and abetting this &s;uppo&s;ed rape&mdash;A civil &s;uit was afterwards commenc|ed again&s;t the per&s;on accu&s;ed, who, though acquited by a jury, was for a long time, to gratify the ven|geance of &s;ome vindictive individual, immured with|in the walls of a pri&s;on&mdash;The accu&s;ation, however, again&s;t the pri&s;oner, has of late appeared to be ab|&s;olutely fal&s;e and groundle&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Colonel Burr previous to the jury being inclo&s;ed, quoted the ca&s;e of three other per&s;ons, who were executed for &s;uppo&s;ed crimes of which it was afterwards clear they were innocent.</NOTE>&mdash;Thus he was a &s;uffer+er on account of popular prejudice.</P>
<P>Without mentioning the&s;e things he had rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e the jury now before him was fully armed
<PB N="25" REF="037576_0023_100EDEE70361E3F8">
again&s;t prejudice, which, in many ca&s;es, had been found to operate again&s;t the innocent: that they &s;hould impartially weigh the whole ma&s;s of te&s;timo|ny before them and give no &s;cope to the effect, which previous reports might have had upon their imagina|tion, that in ca&s;es of this &s;ort every body knew &s;ome|thing: every day added more and more to the report &mdash;ince&s;&s;ant talk upon the &s;ubject inflamed the public mind: frequent repetition induced belief and that ima|gination formed reality.</P>
<P>He concluded by ob&s;erving, that the circum&s;tance of Mr. Weeks, when fir&s;t apprehended, having a&s;ked whether the body of the decea&s;ed was found in the Man|hattan well was not in the least extraordinary, as he had been previou&s;ly appri&s;ed that the muff had been found there. On the whole he believed that the proof again&s;t his client, was &s;o little to the purpo&s;e and that the evi|dence which would now be adduced in his favour, was &s;uch as to induce the jury to bring in a verdict in his favour without leaving their &s;eats.</P>
<P>After having fini&s;hed this eloquent addre&s;s, of which I have given a cur&s;ory &s;ketch, the evidences were then brought forward in favour of Mr. Weeks.</P>
<P>Wm. Seaman being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed, that he lives in the hou&s;e of Mr. Ezra Weeks, as an apprentice; that among&s;t other things a&s;&s;igned to his care, there was that of the hor&s;e and &s;leigh, concerning which Mr. E. Weeks paid little or no attention: that upon the evening of the 22d December, he had as u&s;ual locked up the gate and had either put the key in his pocket or on the mantle-piece, he could not &s;ay which&mdash;nor could he recollect whether he had found it in his pock|et, or on the mantle piece, the next morning&mdash; that, however, when he went there, he found eve|ry thing in the &s;ame &s;ituation as he had left it&mdash;that the &s;leigh had eight bells affixed to it with leather &s;trings, which it would take &s;ome time to unloo&s;e&punc; and that he believed if the knots had been unloo&s;ed, and
<PB N="26" REF="037576_0024_100EDF13F99DF448">
afterwards tied by &s;ome other per&s;on, he was inclined to believe, that he would have ob&s;erved it. He added farther, that he had been home on the evening of the 22d of Dec, &s;aw Mr. Levi Weeks there, about half pa&s;t 8 o'clock, and that he was perfectly mild, compo|&s;ed and cheerful as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Mrs. Fore&s;t being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed, that &s;he lived in the neighborhood of the hou&s;e of Mr. Ring, and of cour&s;e was near at hand, when the unfortunate cir|cum&s;tance of the di&s;appearance, and afterwards the di&s;covery of the decea&s;ed took place. That upon the &s;econd of Jan. about twelve in the forenoon, pre|vious to Mr. Levi Weeks being arre&s;ted, &s;he had men|tioned to him the circum&s;tance of the muff, which the decea&s;ed had worn, being found at or near a well clo&s;e by Bayard's lane: that he received this information with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure, and from every appear|ance, did not di&s;cover the &s;malle&s;t degree of perturba|tion.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph Watkins being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed, that he had been called upon by Mr. Ring, on the twenty &s;econd of Dec. for the purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;ting in fetching up the body of the unfortunate Mi&s;s Sands: that after get|ting a pole properly prepared, with nails in it, and a rope, by which they might with more convenience, take up the corp&s;e. That upon its being got out of the well, her hair appeared to be down and tumbled, her &s;hawl torn off, her face much &s;welled: and being que&s;tioned with re&s;pect to the other injuries which appeared on her body, he &s;eemed to con&s;ider them rather as &s;cratches than brui&s;es. He ob&s;erved farther, that her &s;tockings were down; that with re&s;pect to her feet, he had not ob&s;ereed whether they had been inju|red or not: that the neck of the decea&s;ed was &s;welled; but that he had not perceived any marks.</P>
<P>This witne&s;s further declared, that in September or October la&s;t, during the time that Mrs. Ring was ab&s;ent in the country, he heard a noi&s;e in a room in

Mr. Ring's hou&s;e which was only &s;eparated from his own appartment by a thin partition, and that the noi&s;e was &s;imilar to that, which might happen when hu&s;band and wife were in bed together, that two di&s;tinct voices could be heard upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, the one of which was loud and rough, and the other low; that he be+lieved the voice of the former was that of Elias Ring, and the latter that of Mi&s;s E. Sands; that this &s;truck his mind with a&s;toni&s;hment, and that he was appre|hen&s;ive, it might occa&s;ion great di&s;quietude in Mr. Ring's family. That the voice of the man was not that of Mr. Weeks becau&s;e his was very &s;mooth; that of Mr. Ring on the contrary was rough, and that he was well acquainted with the tone of Mr. Ring's voice: and that for 12 or 14 times he had heard a noi&s;e of a &s;imilar kind between the middle of the months of September and October, that after Mrs. Ring's return no noi&s;e of that nature was heard; that one morning after the di&s;covery of the de|cea&s;ed body, Mrs. Ring appeared exceedingly &s;orry for the &s;ituation of Mr. Weeks, whom &s;he repre&s;ented as being a young man of the mo&s;t friendly di&s;po&s;ition, and exceedingly attached to her family: and that if any per&s;on was &s;ick he would without di&s;crimination pay the utmo&s;t attention. This deponent further added, that the body of the decea&s;ed had, in a room of Mr. Ring's hou&s;e been expo&s;ed for &s;everal days, and afterwards for a few hours previous to its interment, in the &s;treet: that Mr. Croucher was very a&s;&s;iduous in &s;preading &s;u&s;picions again&s;t Mr. L. Weeks.</P>
<P>Mrs. Watkins, the wife of the afore&s;aid deponent, being from &s;ickne&s;s, confined to her room, was &s;worn by the chief ju&s;tice, and her te&s;timony was as follows: That between the room in which &s;he and her hu&s;band &s;lept, and another in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Ring, there was only a thin lath and plai&s;ter partition, that from the middle of Sept. to the middle of Oct. &s;he had fre|quently been di&s;turbed by the ru&s;tling of the beds,

&s;uch as might be occa&s;ioned by man and wife&punc; that the voice was evidently rougher than that of Mr. Weeks: that he po&s;&s;ibly could not be the per&s;on who was with that woman: That Mr. Watkins appeared greatly alarmed about the bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;aid that the devil would be to pay in Mr. Ring's family, upon the return of Mrs. Ring&mdash;That up|on Mrs. Ring's return, no noises of a &s;imilar na|ture were heard: on being a&s;ked with regard to Mi&s;s E. Sands's general conduct &s;he an&s;wered, that &s;he be|lieved it was in general regular and proper, that Mrs. Ring had told her that Mr. Weeks was amiable in his manners and kind to the children; that in fact he was con&s;idered rather as one of the family than a boarder.</P>
<P>Anthony Rutgers being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed that he had fallen in with Elias Ring in Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">wich Street, accom|panied by another per&s;on, that the weather at that time, was exceedingly bad, admitting neither of walking or riding with convenience, that Mr. Ring a&s;ked him if he knew any thing about a muff; upon which the deponent expre&s;&s;ed great &s;urpri&s;e when Mr. Ring told him the girl had been mi&s;&s;ing about eight days, that &s;he might be dead for ought he knew, and her death might be occa&s;ioned by a love fit, that this deponent &s;uppo&s;ing her body might be in the river, advi&s;ed them to employ George Wallgrove who was one of the mo&s;t expert per&s;ons of any in this city for &s;weeping for drowned per&s;ons; the deponent fur|ther declared that from the conver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;ed betwen him and Mr. Ring, he did not believe at the time that Mr. Ring had any idea of the girl's having been murdered.</P>
<P>Mrs. Fore&s;t being again called, mentioned a conver|&s;ation which had pa&s;&s;ed between her and Mr. Grouch|er&mdash;That Mr. Croucher was &s;orry for the unfortu|nate affair: that he had &s;pent the evening of the twen|ty &s;econd of Dec. at a friend's hou&s;e in the bowery: that he was very &s;orry that on his way home, he had

<P>Elizabeth Watkins, daughter of Jo&s;eph Watkins, being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed, That &s;he was acquainted with Mi&s;s E Sands, and that &s;he knew the room in which &s;he &s;lept, to be adjoining to that of her mother's. Up|on being que&s;tioned with re&s;pect to the general char|acter of Mr. Weeks, &s;he declared in her opinion he was a quiet, peaceable, and benevolent young man.</P>
<P>Doct. Mackinto&s;h being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed, That he had been called upon to attend a coroner's inque&s;t, upon the body of Mi&s;s E. Sands, and that going thi|ther, had fallen in with Dr. Prince, who accompanied him, and who was al&s;o de&s;ired by in officer to attend upon the occa&s;ion. That upon examining the body, nothing appeared to vindicate a &s;uppo&s;ition of exter|nal violence, as the injuries which &s;he had reveived, &s;eemed more like &s;cratches, than wounds or brui&s;es: that he had opened her head, brea&s;t and body, and that no extrava&s;ion of blood appeared: that there was no di&s;location of the neck, that, however, there were livid &s;pots&mdash;That being particularly required by the coronore's inque&s;t, to examine whether &s;he was pregnant or not, he was decidedly of opi|nion &s;he was not: that there was no marks of vio|lence on the belly, and that the collar bone was not di&s;located.</P>
<P>Dr. Prince being <HI>&s;worn,</HI>, appeared exactly to coin|cide with Dr. McInto&s;h in opinion.</P>
<P>Dr. Romayne, being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> &s;eemed to coincided in the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>David Fore&s;t being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed, that in a conver|&s;ation with Mr. Croucher, who came into his &s;tore where this deponent was, &s;aid if Mi&s;s Sands was dead, it would be nothing &s;trange to him, after he had heard what the landlord expre&s;&s;ed: he further told him, that there was a material evidence, who would come from

the Jer&s;eys, that would be fully &s;ufficient to have Mr. Weeks arraigned, condemned and hanged!</P>
<P>I&s;rael Lacey being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed, that he was a lodger in Mr. Ring's hou&s;e at the time Mi&s;s Sands di&s;|appeared. That he came home that evening, about ten o'clock, and in about four minutes after, went to bed along with his companion, Mr. Ru&s;&s;el; that du|ring his, the deponent's &s;tay at that hou&s;e, he did not perceive that Mr. Weeks appeared more attentive to Mi&s;s Sands than to any of the other females about the hou&s;e. That upon the night of Mi&s;s Sands' di&s;appear|ing, and on the en&s;uing night; he did not hear any noi&s;e in Mr. Weeks' room: that on the contrary, in all his actions he appeared to be as cool, tranquil and collected as ever.

<P>Mr. Du&s;tan being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed, that on Friday la&s;t, a man, at that time unknown to him, but whom he afterwards knew to be Mr. Croucher, had come in|to his &s;tore, between 6 and 8 o'clock in the morning, who &s;aluted them with "good morning, gentlemen&mdash; Levi Weeks is taken up by the high &s;heriff&mdash;Some more fre&s;h proof will be brought forward again&s;t him &mdash;A material evidence will come forward from Hacken&s;ack." After announcing his name to be Croucher, he took his leave, apparently having no o|ther bu&s;ine&s;s than to communicate this news.</P>
<P>Hugh M'Dougal being <HI>&s;worn,</HI> depo&s;ed, That he had for &s;ome time pa&s;t been acquainted with Mr. Croucher, concerning whom, however, he did not en|tertain the mo&s;t favorable opinion: that upon going through Greenwich &s;treet about the 2d of January, and pa&s;&s;ing the hou&s;e of Mr. Ring, he found Mr. Crouch|er amazingly a&s;&s;iduous in drawing in the multitude who came pa&s;t, to view the corp&s;e: that he mention|ed a variety of circum&s;tances again&s;t Mr. Weeks, in

the propagation of which he appeared very diligent that the &s;aid Croucher had been occa&s;ionally in the ha+bit of coming to his (the deponent's) hou&s;e with &s;uch articles as &s;hawls, &amp;c. to &s;ell; that he made it a gene|ral point to come at dinner time, but not liking him, his vi&s;its were not welcome; that he had told his wife if Mr. Croucher &s;hould come with more goods, &s;he &s;hould tell him that if they wanted any they would call upon him: that upon Thur&s;day la&s;t he had called up|on him while bu&s;y in his garden, and his &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s appeared to be, to inform him of fre&s;h evidence from the Jer&s;eys: To which the deponent replied, that as a difference had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and Mr. Weeks, his conduct appeared to him to be extremely indelicate and improper; and that for his part, notwith&s;tanding all the tales which might be propagated to Mr. Weeks <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">advantage, he &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e him innocent till he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">rd more about it.</P>
