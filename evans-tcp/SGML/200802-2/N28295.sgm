<Q>"And all Judah and Jeru&s;alem mourned for Jo&s;iah."</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a very &s;olemn and affecting &s;cene, which is pre&s;ented to our view, in this portion of &s;acred hi&s;tory. Though a long &s;eries of ages has pa&s;&s;ed away &s;ince it took place, it cannot, yet, be atten|tively reviewed, without exciting in the thought|ful mind, and feeling heart, many &s;erious reflec|tions and tender emotions. With every other part of &s;cripture, it was doubtle&s;s recorded "for our learning," for our in&s;truction and improvement. It &s;hews, particularly, in a &s;triking point of light, how important to a community, are the life and &s;ervices of a great and good prince; or of a per&s;on holding a primary place in the govern|ment of his country&mdash;and in that elevated &s;tation, di&s;tingui&s;hed by his &s;uperior talents, integrity, and public &s;pirit: and how heavy, and afflictive, is the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by a nation, when &s;uch a ruler and benefactor is "taken from its head," by the awful &s;troke of death.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="037715_0003_100ED3F18DC75FD0">
To the&s;e intere&s;ting reflections, we are unavoid|ably led by the con&s;ideration of the pa&s;&s;age before us&mdash;while we here behold the whole Jewi&s;h nation, with one con&s;ent, and as by one in&s;tantaneous im|pul&s;e, a&s;&s;uming the a&s;pect, and exhibiting the to|kens of the deepe&s;t affliction and mourning, on ac|count of the death of their late king Jo&s;iah; who was one of the worthie&s;t and be&s;t, that ever reign|ed over them; and who&s;e life, from his earlie&s;t years, had been employed, under the influence of the pure&s;t and noble&s;t principles, in promoting the temporal and religious intere&s;ts of his people.</P>
<P>This good king was yet in the mid&s;t of his days, or in the vigor of his age, when it was his lot to receive a fatal wound, in a battle, to which he was probably led, by the terms of his alliance with the king of I&s;rael, who was then tributary to the king of Babylon; and therefore bound to engage on the &s;ide of that monarch, in the war which was com|menced again&s;t him by the king of Egypt. Of this wound Jo&s;iah died, immediately after his re|turn to Jeru&s;alem: and thus the flattering, and ap|parently well founded hopes of his people, for a much longer continuance of his reign, and of the multiplied ble&s;&s;ings which they derived from it, were &s;uddenly terminated in the mo&s;t gloomy and painful di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>An event, &s;o calamitous, might well be expected to diffu&s;e the mo&s;t afflicting &s;en&s;ations through the body of the nation; for who&s;e welfare he had &s;hewn &s;o early, &s;o zealous, and &s;o con&s;tant a con|cern. Accordingly, the &s;acred hi&s;torian here in|forms us&mdash;that "All Judah and Jeru&s;alem mourn|ed for Jo&s;iah:" The inhabitants of every part of the country, concurring with tho&s;e of the capital

city, the place of the royal re&s;idence, in every be coming affecting demon&s;tration of &s;orrow, under this heavy national calamity.</P>
<P>It is added, that Jeremiah the prophet, particu|larly lamented for Jo&s;iah. This venerable pro|phet, as it became a &s;ervant of God, under that peculiar &s;acred character which he &s;u&s;tained, was penetrated with the deepe&s;t grief for the lo&s;s of a prince, who&s;e pious cares, and indefatigable exer|tions, were e&s;pecially directed to the advancement of the cau&s;e of religion and virtue: a cau&s;e with which the peace and pro&s;perity, and all the great in|tere&s;ts of every community, as well as of every indi|vidual, are e&s;&s;entially and in&s;eparably connected. And it is al&s;o mentioned, as another memorable circum&s;tance of this national mourning for Jo&s;iah, that it was long perpetuated, by the in&s;titution of certain &s;olemn &s;ervices, including, particularly, &s;ome elegiac compo&s;itions &s;et to plaintive mu&s;ic, in commemoration of an event, &s;o mournful in its nature, and &s;o afflicting in its con&s;equences.</P>
<P>In the hi&s;tory of mankind we &s;hall often find a re|markable &s;imilarity of events and circum&s;tances, oc|curing in the mo&s;t di&s;tant countries &amp; periods of time.</P>
<P>With this memorable mourning of the Jewi&s;h nation, for the lo&s;s of their eminently worthy and amiable Jo&s;iah;&mdash;how &s;triking is the re&s;emblance, that appears in the univer&s;al, unfeigned mourning, now exhibited by the American people, for the lo&s;s of their great, and excellent, and beloved WASH|INGTON; who&s;e life was one of the mo&s;t va|luable ble&s;&s;ings of a beneficent Providence to his country, and who&s;e death is ju&s;tly lamented, as a great national affliction.</P>
<P>When the man, whom God in his good Provi|dence,
<PB N="6" REF="037715_0005_100EF228F98A4538">
was plea&s;ed to honor, as the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed in&s;trument in his hand, for &s;ecuring to the people of America, the liberty civil and religious&mdash;the independence&mdash;the peace, and the pro&s;perity, in the enjoyment of which, they are at this day, apparently, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> mo&s;t favored, and happy nation in the world. When he, who, obedient to the voice of his country, repeatedly, and with magnanimous &s;elf-denial, exchanged his beloved dome&s;tic pur|&s;uits and enjoyments, for the mo&s;t arduous &s;ta|tions of public tru&s;t and &s;ervice: And in tho&s;e &s;tations victoriou&s;ly led our armies through the vi|ci&s;&s;itudes of a mo&s;t difficult and perilous revolu|tionary war; and ably, and &s;ucce&s;sfully pre&s;ided in the executive department of our national go|vernment, during many of the mo&s;t eventful years of an unexampled, and awfully portentous cri&s;is in Europe, in which our political and commercial intere&s;ts were deeply involved. When he, who in the favorite &s;cenes of private life, in which he de|lighted to pa&s;s his tranquil days, whenever the &s;afety and glory of his country permitted, di&s;play|ed the beauty and loveline&s;s of tho&s;e finer feelings, and accompli&s;hments, which dignify and adorn the gentleman, the philo&s;opher, the friend, and the dome&s;tic character. When he, in a word, who fir&s;t vindicated our rights, as men and chri&s;tians, with his &s;word; and then &s;hielded them from the envious, ho&s;tile de&s;igns of powerful foreign nations, and the turbulence of re&s;tle&s;s inte&s;tine factions, by the wi&s;dom of his coun&s;els the equity, modera|tion, and firmne&s;s of his mea&s;ures; and who uni|formly &s;hone pre-eminent in great talents, in di&s;in|tere&s;ted patrioti&s;m, and in the lu&s;tre of his public and private virtues and u&s;efulne&s;s:&mdash;
<PB N="7" REF="037715_0006_100EF22AF990D8D0">
When &s;uch a man is removed by the &s;upreme, righteous Di&s;po&s;er of all things, from every &s;ta|tion of honorable tru&s;t, and important &s;ervice among his fellow-mortals&mdash;and from all the &s;cenes of mortality;&mdash;&s;urely, it well becomes the nation, of which he was one of the brighte&s;t ornaments, and greate&s;t benefactors, to mourn with the feelings of undi&s;&s;embled, deep, and la&s;ting &s;orrow!</P>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;orrow all the citizens of the United-States, who really love their country&mdash;with many in other nations, who po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;en&s;ibilities of a feel|ing heart, and the genuine &s;pirit of philanthropy, will bear a tender &s;ympathetic part; and &s;incerely mourn the father of his country, the patron of liberty, the friend of humanity&mdash;fallen under that &s;troke of death, to which the greate&s;t, and mo&s;t illu&s;trious, equally with the fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ble&s;t, and mo&s;t ob|&s;cure of the human race, mu&s;t finally bow.&mdash;</P>
<P>Of the general mourning, which the death of a man, &s;o eminently and honorably di&s;tingui&s;hed in life, might well be expected to produce&mdash;the mo&s;t unequivocal tokens are exibited, wherever the mel|ancholy tidings of it have been &s;pread abroad. The cu&s;tomary badges of grief, which indicate a near and valued friend departed; together with the vari|ous, more public and &s;olemn expre&s;&s;ions of a nati|on's &s;orrows, proclaim, in the mo&s;t affecting, and impre&s;&s;ive language, that our illu&s;trious and belo|ved WASHINGTON is numbered with the dead; and that his country &s;en&s;ibly feels, and &s;in|cerely mourns, the deeply intere&s;ting, and afflicting event!&mdash;</P>
<P>That the &s;orrows, which we &s;hare in common with our fellow-citizens, throughout the union, and with the friends of liberty and humanity generally,
<PB N="8" REF="037715_0007_100EF22CD537A018">
under this bereaving di&s;pen&s;ation of Divine Provi|dence, may be brought under the guidance of &s;ober reflection and true wi&s;dom, and directed to &s;ome u&s;eful ends.&mdash;</P>

<P>II. What profitable improvement may be made of the event, which is the occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent general mourning of our country.&mdash;</P>
<P>I. Why the death of great and worthy men, who have been eminently u&s;eful in their day, and e&s;pe|cially in exalted &s;tations of public tru&s;t and u&s;eful|ne&s;s, ought to be lamented.&mdash;</P>
<P>Now the death of &s;uch men may well be lamen|ted.</P>
<P N="1">1. On account of the many and great evils which they are in&s;trumental in averting from a people.&mdash;</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent fallen &s;tate of human nature, the pa&s;&s;ions of men, their pride, their ambition&mdash;their avarice, their love of criminal plea&s;ure; in a word, their &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, &s;trongly impel them to deeds of inju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion,&mdash;and violence.&mdash;By the&s;e vicious di&s;po&s;itions, individuals are often &s;timula|ted to bitter and deadly contentions;&mdash;and com|munities, and nations, are plunged into all the out|rages and calamities of public, and long protract|ed wars. If left to follow the impul&s;e of the&s;e cor|rupt propen&s;ities of their fallen nature, without re&s;traint or oppo&s;ition, a few of the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t unprincipled, bringing others, by force or ar|tifice, into a &s;ub&s;erviency to their views, would
<PB N="9" REF="037715_0008_100EF22EFA324CD8">
not he&s;itate, with the aid of &s;uch in&s;truments of their will, to invade the rights, to &s;eize the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to &s;acrifice the lives of their fellow-men, in any extent which they might think expedient, or find practicable, to the accompli&s;hment of their own ba&s;e and criminal purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>But as the great Ruler of the univer&s;e, has de|&s;igned and formed mankind for the &s;ocial &s;tate; and has made their common mutual &s;afety and welfare depend, in a great mea&s;ure, upon that union and order which con&s;titute the &s;trength and beauty of &s;ociety;&mdash;&s;o he con&s;tantly exerci&s;es a &s;ecret con|trol over all human inclinations, projects, and en|terprizes:&mdash;And having the hearts of all men in his hands, he holds all their tumultuous imagina|tions, raging appetites, and furious pa&s;&s;ions, con|tinually &s;ubject to that irre&s;i&s;tible authority and power, by which, when he plea&s;es, he commands the &s;tormy winds into a calm; and &s;ays to the &s;wel|ling boi&s;terous &s;ea, "Hitherto &s;halt thou come, but no farther; and here &s;hall thy proud waves be &s;tayed." In his government of mankind, how|ever, and for the accompli&s;hment of his wi&s;e de|&s;igns, relating to them, he generally u&s;es &s;ome vi|&s;ible means and &s;ubordinate agency, which have a natural fitne&s;s to bring about the worthy ends that he has propo&s;ed. In this view, he employs emi|nently the in&s;titutions of religion, and the mini&s;|ters of his word, among the people, to whom he has been plea&s;ed to grant the di&s;tingui&s;hing privi|leges and benefits of Divine Revelation. And in the nations generally, he rai&s;es up from time to time, par|ticular per&s;ons, endued with &s;ome peculiar talents and di&s;po&s;itions; by which they are qualified to rule over their fellow men,&mdash;and prompted to em|ploy
<PB N="10" REF="037715_0009_100EF2308560B580">
their power and influence, in providing for the common welfare of the great body of the peo|ple; in re&s;training and quieting the turbulent mem|bers of the community; and in di&s;concerting the &s;chemes, and repelling the a&s;&s;aults of their various enemies.</P>
<P>Thus&mdash;while the Supreme Governor of Nations, &s;ometimes elevates men of &s;trong natural abilities, connected with the mo&s;t vile, and profligate moral principles, to great power,&mdash;and then u&s;es them as the &s;word in his hand, for cha&s;ti&s;ing any wicked and rebellious people, whom he determines to puni&s;h;&mdash;he al&s;o, at his plea&s;ure, calls forth, and ad|vances to exalted &s;tations of authority and tru&s;t, men of &s;uperior talents and worthy character; and by their in&s;trumentality &s;hields or delivers a people, whom he chu&s;es to favour, from tho&s;e violences or grievances, with which they may be menaced or oppre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;By their friendly and &s;ucce&s;sful agen|cy, the nation, or community, with the care of who&s;e intere&s;ts they are entru&s;ted, whether in the capacity of military commanders, or civil magi&s;|trates, is re&s;cued from the galling yoke of bond|age&mdash;from the dreadful &s;tate of anarchy and confu|&s;ion: or from the final di&s;&s;olution and utter ruin, to which it might otherwi&s;e be reduced, by the fol|ly and wickedne&s;s of many of its own members; or by the all gra&s;ping ambition, and in&s;atiable cu|pidity of foreign ho&s;tile nations and potentates.</P>
<P>Such are the men, whom "the Lord Mo&s;t High&mdash;Who is the great King over all the earth," often "gives to a people, according to his mani|fold mercies, to be" under him&s;elf, "their &s;avi|ours;" to be "the mini&s;ters of God, for" eminent "good," to them in a &s;tate of peace; and his cho|&s;en

in&s;truments, for "&s;aving them out of the hand of their enemies," in a time of war. When, there|fore, men thus &s;pecially qualified, and called to fill the mo&s;t exalted and important &s;tations, in the &s;er|vice of their country; and thus employed, under the direction of Divine Providence, in averting from it the mo&s;t formidable and de&s;tructive evils, are removed by death; the afflictive event is doubt|le&s;s to be regarded, as ju&s;tly demanding the tears of a bereaved people&mdash;as worthy of being lamented with every dignified expre&s;&s;ion of unfeigned na|tional &s;orrow.</P>
<P>I proceed to ob&s;erve, on the other hand, that the death of &s;uch valuable defenders, and guar|dians of a people, is to be thus lamented.</P>
<P N="2">2ndly. On account of the eminent benefits, which their in&s;trumentality is employed, by the good Providence of God, in &s;ecuring to their country.</P>
<P>Many of the reflections, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would be here naturally led to pur&s;ue, have been, in &s;ome degree, already anticipated, in the ob&s;ervations &s;ugge&s;ted under the preceding branch of this di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of the in&s;titution and &s;upport of government, among mankind, is univer&s;ally ac|knowledged; and its utility has been recommended by the experience of all nations, in all ages. So far as any &s;y&s;tem of government is adapted to unite a people in a &s;tate of order and peace&mdash;to enforce the principles and rules of ju&s;tice among them&mdash;and to &s;ecure them from the mi&s;chievous de&s;igns of their enemies, it is &s;anctioned by the approbation of Heaven; and its e&s;tabli&s;hment is to be regarded, as
<PB N="12" REF="037715_0011_100EF234765AA470">
an important public ble&s;&s;ing, by the people who enjoy it.</P>
<P>Between different &s;y&s;tems of human government, there is indeed as wide a difference, as between the mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut, rai&s;ed by the rude &s;avage, merely for his defence from the attacks of bea&s;ts of prey, or the injurious effects of inclement elements and &s;ea&s;ons; and the noble&s;t edifice, erected by the inge|nious arti&s;t, combining requi&s;ite &s;trength, with plea|&s;ing proportion, and cha&s;te ornament, and adapt|ed to afford the mo&s;t &s;ecure and comfortable ac|commodation to its inhabitants. But for directing well, and applying efficaciou&s;ly, the powers of the be&s;t con&s;titution of government, it is obvious, that none are properly qualified, but tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s peculiar abilities for the management of pub|lic affairs: And it is equally certain, that on the moral principles, which direct their conduct, the welfare of the community very much depends. Whether they are charged with the admini&s;tration of the civil, or military affairs of their country; having its great intere&s;ts committed to their care, and its re&s;ources placed in their hands; they are at once laid under peculiar obligations, and enjoy peculiar advantages, for &s;tudying and promoting the public good; and when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e uni|ted qualities of the head and the heart, which di&s;|tingui&s;h great and worthy rulers and commanders&mdash;the public good will be the favorite object of their regard and pur&s;uit&mdash;and in the ordinary cour&s;e of things, will be greatly advanced by their agency. In their &s;uperior &s;tation, di&s;tingui&s;hed by their great talents and virtues&mdash;by their knowledge of human nature, of its powers and weakne&s;&s;es&mdash;of its pa&s;&s;ions and its wants&mdash;and of the &s;tate of their
<PB N="13" REF="037715_0012_100EF236ADDE4770">
own nation, con&s;idered in an ab&s;tract point of view, and in its relations to other countries&mdash;by their pe|netrating, accurate judgment, and enlarged, com|prehen&s;ive view of things&mdash;by the wi&s;dom of their coun&s;els, and the rectitude of their mea&s;ures&mdash;by the purity and ardor of their patrioti&s;m; and by their active courage, and unyielding re&s;olution, in meeting and &s;urmounting the various and multipli|ed dangers, difficulties and trials, which they may have to encounter in their country's cau&s;e and &s;er|vice&mdash;they are eminently qualified, to teach the great body of the people, for whom they act, the nature and value of their civil and &s;acred rights, and privileges, and to guide and animate their ex|ertions in the pur&s;uit and defence of their true in|tere&s;ts;&mdash;and under the &s;miles of a favoring Pro|vidence, their in&s;trumentality has a great effect, in &s;ecuring and improving the mo&s;t important nation|al advantages.</P>
<P>The de&s;irable ends, which their high qualifica|tions, and patriotic labours are thus adapted to ac|compli&s;h, are further promoted by the powerful engaging influence of their great example. For "as the going forth of the &s;un, is from the end of heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it, and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof;" &s;o the examples of great and good men, moving in exalted &s;pheres of public &s;ervice, and u&s;efulne&s;s, diffu&s;e their en|lightening and enlivening beams, through the wide extent of the land in which they bear rule; and have an happy tendency to &s;timulate and allure the other members of the community, in &s;ubordinate &s;tations, to imitate their conduct, in the cul|tivation of a public &s;pirit, and in the practice of what&s;oever things are pious and ju&s;t&mdash;generous
<PB N="14" REF="037715_0013_100EF23834FB2BE0">
and honorable&mdash;lovely and prai&s;e-worthy:&mdash;and, in &s;hort, in the pur&s;uit of that cour&s;e of well doing, which conducts individuals, and communities, to a &s;tate of the mo&s;t de&s;irable pro&s;perity in this world; while it leads tho&s;e, who walk in it, under the in|fluence of a truly chri&s;tian faith, to glory, honour, and immortality in the world to come.</P>
<P>Highly favored indeed, are the people to whom the Lord gives &s;uch rulers and commanders, as his cho&s;en agents, for communicating and &s;ecuring to them &s;o many precious ble&s;&s;ings of his favor&mdash;and &s;o rich a portion of national honor and hap|pine&s;s!</P>
<P>When, therefore, a people are bereaved of &s;uch valuable benefactors, they &s;u&s;tain an un&s;peakable lo&s;s; and are &s;olemnly called by the Providence of God to mourn&mdash;feelingly and deeply to mourn under the heavy and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;troke of his holy hand.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations which have been &s;ugge&s;ted, will, it is believed, admit of a ju&s;t and forcible ap|plication to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e of our own nation, un|der that very afflicting di&s;pen&s;ation of Divine Pro|vidence, which has bereaved us, of a general and &s;tate&s;man, who, in the expre&s;&s;ive and emphatical language of our Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives in Con|gre&s;s,&mdash;"was the fir&s;t in war&mdash;the fir&s;t in peace, and the fir&s;t in the affections of his country."</P>

But from the tomb of the great WASHINGTON, for whom his country now mourns, through all its borders&mdash;the voice of death &s;peaks to us with more than ordinary &s;olem|nity and empha&s;is&mdash;"Be ye al&s;o ready&mdash;for in &s;uch an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh." "In &s;uch an hour as we think not," or may be lea&s;t aware of his approach, the Son of Man, "who hath the keys of death, and of the invi&s;ible world," may come, by his dread &s;ummons, to call us from time to eternity&mdash;from a temporary &s;tate of &s;ervice and trial, to an everla&s;ting &s;tate of righte|ous and unchangeable retribution.</P>
<P>How &s;oon did the humane and amiable hero, yield to the violence of unrelenting di&s;ea&s;e!&mdash;How quickly did the mighty and renowned conqueror fall, with all his mortal honors blooming upon him&mdash;"in that war in which there is no di&s;charge!"</P>
<P>And mu&s;t not we as certainly die? And may we not, in like manner, die with as little previous warning of our impending di&s;&s;olution&mdash;or by a &s;troke from the la&s;t enemy, &s;till more &s;udden and unexpected? O let us ha&s;ten then, in our prepara|tion for the clo&s;ing &s;cene of life&mdash;for that all im|portant change of worlds to which we are approach|ing, as fa&s;t as the rapid flight of time can bear us forward!</P>

Let us look well to our&s;elves, and &s;ee that our &s;ouls are committed in the exerci&s;e of that unfeign|ed faith, "which is the gift of God, and the work of his holy &s;pirit," into the hands of that Divine, Al|mighty, and mo&s;t gracious Redeemer, "who&s;e is the only name under Heaven, given among men, by which any can be &s;aved;" and on who&s;e atone|ment, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and interce&s;&s;ion, the mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious &s;aviours of their country, equally with the meane&s;t and mo&s;t abject of the children of men, mu&s;t entirely depend, for the forgivene&s;s of their &s;ins&mdash;for reconciliation and peace with God; and for the attainment of that everla&s;ting life, which God has promi&s;ed to believers, and which is to be found only in his Son. Let us, al&s;o, be active and diligent, "stedfa&s;t and immovable, and more and more abounding, in all the work and &s;ervice of the Lord," to which we are called, as the followers of the great Captain of our &s;alvation; and let it be our mo&s;t &s;erious concern, and care, that we may be found ever watching for the coming of our Lord&mdash;and waiting with a &s;tedfa&s;t faith, with a lively hope, and with an earne&s;t de&s;ire, for his &s;o|vereign order to lay down our fle&s;h in its native earth; and to enter, di&s;incumbered of all the bur|thens of mortality; and completely delivered and purified, from the power and pollution of &s;in, un|der which we now groan, into the full and ever|la&s;ting "joy of our Lord."</P>
<P>Then will the cour&s;e of our pilgrimage, through this vale of tears, clo&s;e in peace:&mdash;and "having fought the good fight, and fini&s;hed the work," which our Lord has appointed to be accompli&s;hed by us, on earth&mdash;and having thus approved our|&s;elves "faithful" in his cau&s;e and &s;ervice, "unto

death, we &s;hall receive the crown of immortal life, which he hath promi&s;ed, and which he will give to all who believe in, and obey him, and who love his appearing." And then, in his heavenly kingdom&mdash;"wa&s;hed from our &s;ins in his blood, who loved us, and gave him&s;elf for us; and ad|vanced to the dignity of kings and prie&s;ts unto God and his father,"&mdash;we &s;hall mourn no more for the awful de&s;olations of death, or under any of the lamentable effects of &s;in; but &s;hall find "all tears wiped away from our eyes," by the kind hand of our gracious God and Redeemer; and "be|holding his face in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;atisfied with his likene&s;s, we &s;hall triumph in his prai&s;e, and in that fulne&s;s of joy which is in his pre&s;ence," through all the ages of a ble&s;&s;ed eternity!</P>
<P>"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invi|&s;ible, the only wi&s;e God and our Saviour, be honor and glory, for ever and ever." AMEN!</P>
